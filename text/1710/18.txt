I
t’s clear that the
Nintendo titan that
is Reggie heard the
cries of the dissat-
isfied Smash player, for
he has finally achieved
perfection with the mag-
nificent game that is Super
Smash Bros. Ultimate.
On a serious note, Smash
Ultimate is a spectacular
game; despite not quite
capturing the nostalgia
that came with the N64
game melee, it makes up
for it by building signif-
cantly on its predecessors.
Accompanied by a stag-
geringly large collection
of OSTs from numerous
series, all your favourite
stages from the past
games, and not to forget
a gigantic roster, Smash
leaves you satisfied.
With ever changing
metas and tier lists, the
game has a constantly
changing dynamic with
so much variety that the
game can be quite in-
timidating. That’s where
we come in! We may not
be top tier gamers, but
we’re avid players of the
series, and know a trick
or two; mostly from from
watching the pros and
tournaments. As such, we
are proud to announce the
creation of Smash Corner,
a section of Felix Games
that focuses entirely on
Smash and could poten-
tially develop into some-
thing bigger with a large
enough following!
But it’s early days, so
for the moment, we aim
to keep you up to date
on the meta whilst giving
you tips on how to deal
with bullshit Yoshi edge
guarding,Simon/Richter’s
insane range, and grena-
dier Snake players, along
with other ways to tackle
new machines incurred by
the ever changing meta.
We’re looking to have
a weekly Smash corner
article, focusing on how
to maximise a characters’s
A new chapter is being turned for Felix gaming as we embark on a quest to provide you with quality info on how
to up your smash games, with weekly characters analysis and tips.

potential, and a general
rundown of their abilities
as well as counters to each
character.
And for the even more
competitive players we
may host competitions
in the distant future, but
that’s most likely going to
be the case if there seems
to be a following for the
Smash Corner articles. So
keep your eyes peeled and
feel free to drop us an
email at games.felix@

interested in writing
a character profile, or
anything else Smash
related!
