CXCAC’s runners
returned from the
Christmas break in
dire need of a train-
ing weekend, and 2019’s
winter tour destination
was Church Stretton – a
quaint town just outside
Shropshire’s county town
of Shrewsbury.
During the late Victori-
an period the small town
was known as “Little
Switzerland” and grew
a reputation as a health
resort: exactly what the
team needed.
The squad set out in
earnest at rush hour on
Friday evening. Thanks to
some excellent DJing, the
journey flew by.
The team rose early on
Saturday to make a trip
to the local Shrewsbury
parkrun – one of a large
national network of free,
weekly and timed 5km
runs every Saturday at
9.00am.
Huddling around the
bandstand for warmth,
the runners listened to the
course instructions care-
fully as they all wanted to
leave their mark on one
of the country’s largest
parkruns.
Almost 700 runners - a
course record - gathered
on the start line along the
River Severn, and then
they were off!
The course was far from
flat, with a steep hill to
climb and descend around
“The Dingle” followed
by a fast out-and-back
“They all
wanted to
leave their
mark on one of
the country’s
largest
parkruns”
“The squad
were forced to
make a visit to
the infamous
“tuck shop””
tarmac path along the
river with a turn around
“The Monument” before a
second lap.
ICXCAC’s runners
were focused, taking a
ruthless racing line around
the bends and cheering on
each other as they passed
in opposing directions.
The field was led
home by Niki Faulkner
with a time of 16:01, and
whilst he was (slightly)
disappointed not to go
sub-16, he was the only
team member not to be
beaten by the 17-year-old
local who crossed the line
second in 16:20.
Following him in
bronze position was
Henry Hart in 16:39 and
fresher Alix Vermeulen
came in 3rd for the girls
with a time of 19:33.
After hassling some
other locals for a team
photo (above), the team
returned to base for a
large brunch before a trip
to the host’s old school
for a training session with
their cross country team.
The squad was led
around the “prestigious”
course on a warm-up by
a gaggle of young talent,
headed by a rapid 13-
year-old.
Following the warm-up
the team got their breath
back and with the route
fresh in their minds,
everyone aligned on the
start line ready for a timed
lap.
The aim for the
Imperial athletes was to
navigate the course from
memory but this proved
considerably harder than
it sounds.
ICXCAC made a
strong start with 4 of their
boys in the top 6, and this
continued for around half
a lap with the strong 13
year-old kindly shouting
directions to ensure no
illegal shortcuts were
taken.
Just as Niki was be-
ginning to pull away and
take a commanding lead,
disaster struck! The team
reached a crossroads and
could not remember the
way.
They frantically spread
out and followed their
memories as best they
could but it was not until
fresher and navigator-ex-
traordinaire Matt Ryan
arrived that they found the
correct route.
By this point the 13
year-old was hot on their
heels. Keen to resume
the lead, Niki and Men’s
Captain Jack McKeon
desperately tried to find
a way through a rather
bushy hedge but to no
avail. They were forced
to retrace their steps as
Shrewsbury’s speedy
youth stormed ahead.
Before long it was the
home straight and the 13-
year-old zoomed home in
3rd place, delighted that
he would be moving up
the school leaderboard.
Niki and Jack arrived at
the finish line distraught,
and the squad were forced
to make a visit to the
infamous “tuck shop” to
cheer themselves up.
The evening saw
plenty of stretching,
kazoo playing, refuelling,
Pictionary, cross-country
watching, dubious scat-
tergories and questionable
chat.
Sunday morning was
quite an effort for the few
who made a poor decision
to stay awake until the
early hours, but amazingly
all the non-injured athletes
made it out for a trail
running adventure starting
from their doorstep.
After racing up a
number of hills the club
captain set his sights on
a particularly large hill
he had dubbed “Kiliman-
jaro”. Only the bravest
(most foolish?) explorers
opted for this option and
they pranced up to the
summit like mountain
goats, battling the
near-vertical ascent and
howling winds.
Eventually they all
returned safely and set
about packing for the trip
back to London.
The large quantity of
food remaining meant
the final lunch was a de-
licious buffet of spaghetti,
chicken sausages, mashed
potato, tomatoes, apples,
unripe bananas and
leftover bolognese.
Having survived this
ordeal, the squad hit the
road and returned feeling
revitalised and ready for
the cross-crountry season
to resume next week.
