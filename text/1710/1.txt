Former Business
School student, Amy
Freelander, recounts
her Imperial ordeal

Editor-in-Chief
A
n ex-Imperial
student has
reached out
to Felix to
share the experience
she had last year with
the Business School;
an experience which
she describes as “tanta-
mount to discrimination
against people with
mental health problems
and those who are gen-
der non-conforming.”
Amy Freelander, who
works full time as a tech
manager at Google, was
enrolled on Imperial
College Business School’s
Online Global MBA in
January 2018. However,
following what she has
described as “discrimina-
tion by 1000 cuts”, Amy
withdrew from the course
in May.
“I started the year well,
full of confidence and
excitement at new pros-
pects and end the year, still
unable to function correct-
ly, even on medication,
under psychiatric care and
in therapy, suffering from
hypersomnia, migraines,
generalised anxiety dis-
order and severe clinical
depression.”
The course is struc-
tured such that students
are placed in syndicate
groups of about five or six
per group. Students then
work together with their
syndicate group and pro-
gress through the course,
keeping the same syndi-
cate group throughout.
Unfortunately for Amy,
she ran into problems with
the people in her syndicate
group. In an interview
with Felix, Amy stated,
“generally speaking, there
were just problems, I felt,
with emotional immatu-
rity of the cohort and the
syndicate groups”. Amy,
who describes herself as
sitting “in the non-binary
area” since she doesn’t
“actually 100% identify
as female”, felt that she
was bullied and discrimi-
nated against because she
has “a lot of personality
traits that people would
associate with men.”
“People would say
that I was aggressive,
very bold, very brazen;
all these kind of things
which, societally, are
more accepted in men or
expected of men and so,
when I exhibited those be-
havioural traits within our
group, both in the larger
cohort and within smaller
groups, I was very much
rejected for that.” For
Amy, this begs the further
question: “Why was I
called aggressive just
for raising issues? Was it
because people thought I
was a woman?”
Amy noticed further
issues surrounding
