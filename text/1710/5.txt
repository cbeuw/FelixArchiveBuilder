What possible change
on campus this new year
could spur so many people
to respond with anger?
What possible subject, re-
quiring no effort on most
anyone’s part could cause
hordes to descend upon
Imperial’s most popular
social media platform at
Imperial College Exposed
to express their outrage?
Of course, it’s reducing
how much meat we eat.
Of course.
If anything has been
made clear by the trial
of meat free Mondays so
far (of which there will
have been only two by
this newspaper’s release)
it’s that many people are
angry. Many students
perhaps understandably
feel that their lifestyle and
identity is under attack.
Less understandable is
how eating meat is so key
to their identity, and even
less intelligible is how
one or at most two meals
without meat a week con-
stitutes an attack on said
senseless identity.
The second thing that
has become clear is that
this is apparently the fault
of “the vegans”. Not the
WHO’s, who have clearly
stated that meat consump-
tion is tied to cancer risk.
Nor is it the IPCC envi-
ronmental scientists’fault,
despite the demonstrably
high impact of animal
agriculture on climate
change which, it may be
worth remembering, is
something we need to
solve soon before we leave
our planet uninhabitable
for the next generation.
No. It is clearly the vegans
who are at fault. The
vegans must be in control,
because why else would
there be no meat nor dairy
nor fish on campus on
Mondays. Except there’s
still fish. And all the dairy.
And sandwiches aren’t
even included in meat free
Mondays.
Perhaps if it weren’t for
the incessant muddying
of waters with regards to
infringement of personal
freedoms and social
responsibility, as found
in the American question
of guns as well as other
endless political debates,
then it might be easier
to tolerate people being
so pathetically whiny
about meat free Mondays.
Unfortunately, eating less
meat isn’t just a question
of personal preference or
how much you’re willing
to do for the environment.
It’s not enough anymore,
if it ever was, for some
people to stop eating meat
once a week. We need
societal change because,
face it: you live in a
society. We all live on the
same dying blue dot. My
not eating meat means
as this. If you need help
changing, I’m here to
help. If you’re unwilling
to change, it makes no
sense for everyone else to
sit around and watch you
mess things up for the rest
of us. You need to change
as much as anyone else.
So, are meat free
Mondays okay? Well,
they’re the smallest step
in the right direction that
we should be happy to
support. It’s one meal a
week, people, and it’s
only pescatarian. What’s
not okay is how pathetic
and incapable some
people seem to be when
presented with vegetarian
food.
A travesty has occured at Imperial
Meat-free Mondays are an assault on everything that we hold dear at Imperial: unethical
consumption under capitalism.
T
he vegetarians, or
vegans or what-
ever powerful
fruit- and veg-
based cult that apparently
runs this university has
struck again. If you, like
myself, are a carnivore
innocently minding
your own business, you
will have run into the
horror that is meat-free
Mondays. How is it that
these green-fingered

sandal-wearing tree-hug-
gers have moved from
being shunned at the
edges of society to having
enough power to manip-
ulate what I can eat for
lunch? Much like other
extreme political ideol-
ogies that emerge from
the shadows to oppress us
normal-red blooded meat
lovers, the animal friends
convention has risen up.
Now is the winter of our
discontent.
How is it that the veg-
etable slime can impose
their will upon us. Some
of them make the claim
that the Union has the
mandate to rule on what I sentiment. I personally
believe in climate change,
but I believe that people
undersell the potential
benefits. For one thing it
may get warmer and for
another, it might drown all
those pesky tax havens. I
believe it is my personal
duty to stimulate as much
demand as possible for
that aim alone. That alone
would be worth it, not
withstanding the joy of
eating a juicy steak.
Some argue that this
approach is about making
us healthier and happier as
a result of giving up meat
for a day a week. What
a bunch of hypocrites.
Are they not all addicted
to the most unhealthy,
diabetes inducing food
of all- sugar? Sugar is
manently with no chance
of it being subject to the
same sanctions.
In summary, as much
as I can no longer get an
erection without looking
at the portrait of the
queen, why is it that the
veggie extremists cannot
comprehend that I cannot
bring myself to eat unless
I know that a semi-sen-
tient animal has suffered?
Something must die for
me to live. And preferably
that thing should be pink
and squealing. And not a
child.
“Why are the
treehuggers
now able to
manipulate
what I can
have for
lunch?”
“Global
warming
might mean
that we can
drown tax
havens”
put in my mouth as a part
of reducing emissions. In
general I agree with that sold around campus per-
“We need
societal
change to
save the dying
blue dot we
inhabit”
nothing if you keep doing
all the clearly harmful
things to environment
that are as easy to solve
