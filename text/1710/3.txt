inclusion when lecturers
took it upon themselves to
address the cohort about
gender issues and has told
Felix of “lecturers talking
in lectures about LGBT+
issues with no under-
standing of the topics that
they were talking about
(confusing transvestism,
transgender people, and
drag queens and calling
them scary and saying
that all men have to do
is dress up as women to
understand them)”. Amy
also complained about
“deans not understanding
what constitutes offensive
notions to LGBT+ people
(e.g. telling people that
they turned other people
gay) and arguing with me,
as an LGBT+ person, that
I shouldn't be offended
by what I am offended
by”. Despite having good
intentions, the lecturers
made “a complete mess
of it”, leading Amy to
question whether they
received “institutional
support or training to talk
about” the topic.
“My main concern is,
there are a lot of people
on that course who never
would have probably
ever encountered LGBT
people and, because it’s
a global course as well,
there’s going to be a lot
of people that are coming
from cultures where it’s
even illegal to be LGBT.
Having somebody stand
up and talk from a point
of authority as a lecturer
about these things from an
ill-informed manner was a
real problem for me.”
Amy shared that a
lecturer “also said some
other things which, as a
feminist”, she “struggled
with as well”:
“He said things around,
‘Well of course I don’t
want to offend women,
I’ve got 2 daughters’. That
classic line of ‘because
they’re our mothers,
sisters and daughters, of
course we love them’…
that’s just nonsense but
it just further propagates
biases that people have.”
To Amy, the issues
“started moving into the
territory of a form of
institutional sexism… in-
stitutional discrimination”
and Amy claims that,
even back in the induction
week, “there was evidence
of it”. “They had guest
lecturers come in who
would call the women
‘darling’ who would say
‘oh no I’ve got to take this
question from this lovely
lady in front, I can’t leave
a damsel in distress’”.
Amy found herself asking
the futher question, “what
does diversity mean to
education courses - how
can you integrate all the
voices and ensure things
are kept respectful?”
Amy believes that part
of the problem was the
university failed to “set
up a good enough, strong
enough Imperial culture”
and wonders what the
Business School’s Ad-
missions policy looks at
to “ensure diversity and
that the students entering
have the right attitudes to
teamwork and diversity”.
Amy also suggests that
managing diversity should
be a core syllabus item on
the MBA course.
“People would natural-
ly come in and exhibit the
culture that they were used
to, which was a problem
and it ended up that we all
clashed and the university
“They had high
staff turnover,
which
really was
contributing
to their
problems”
itself wasn’t very good at
supporting us at all”.
Problems surrounding
equality, diversity and in-
clusion were not the only
sources of distress for
Amy. “There were a lot
of content issues; things
hadn’t been checked, the
quality wasn’t very good”,
tells Amy of already spot-
ting “red flags” within the
one-week induction and
the pre-induction periods.
Besides the fact that
much of the content was
from Harvard Business
School and there were
“lots of mistakes and out-
dated content”, Amy also
noticed “endless material
focused on white, cisgen-
dered males”.
“A lot of the content
was very much targeted to
a male perspective. They
gave analogies related to
football and F1 and things
that you could understand
how, in the ‘70s that’s
what you would accept
from a Business school
but, in this day and age,
it wasn’t good enough.
They received a lot of
complaints.”
“I know that,
on reflection,
they have
realised that
was a mistake”
Imperial Business
School carry their “elite
status” with pride and
market themselves as one
of the world’s leading
universities. In Amy’s
opinion, Imperial Busi-
ness School still has a lot
to work on before being
worthy of its “elite status”
in the world.
“There are of course
some faculty members
who you see are trying, or
have found themselves in
an environment that isn’t
representative of how
they’d do things but the
vast majority of staff, and
materials are not where
they should be for an elite
school.”
According to Amy, she
and many of the students
in the cohort were just
learning off YouTube,
which begs the question,
“how can the Business
School justify the cost
of its Global MBA pro-
gramme?”
Amy said: “They
wanted you to pay your
money, take what you’re
given. For a lot of stu-
dents, it was because they
just wanted the Imperial
name, they just wanted the
certificate and this is part
of the problem. This was
also part of the tension
within the cohort. The
vast majority of people
were doing it because
of Imperial’s reputation.
They didn’t really care
so much about the quality
of what we were being
taught.” Other students
in the cohort have tried to
defend this in ways which
Amy considers “selfish,
misguided and unethical,
including arguing that,
“paying a lot for a course
means that you should
work hard, even if this
means teaching yourself
or struggling through
materials because of poor
administration or teach-
ing.”
For Amy, the whole
reason that she chose
Imperial was because
she thought it “implied
quality”: “I thought that
I’d be getting a high
quality of teaching, a
high quality of integrity,
when in reality, it’s all
just brand, it’s all just
representation. That’s
all I feel the majority of
the staff at the Business
School really care about.
They don’t care about
the quality for quality’s
sake, they care about what
people think about them,
which is not the same”
Amy found herself
asking whether Imperial
College is elite or elitist
and whether the two
can be separated. “In an
ideal world, you’d want
integrity and reputation to
go hand-in-hand but we
all know that reputation
and integrity, there’s not
a direct parallel all the
time. There should be but
there isn’t, especially with
organisations and institu-
tions that have been going
for many, many years if
not over centuries. It takes
a long time for reputations
and brands to change, it’s
not an overnight thing.”
Amy complains of
problems that she felt
“gave people who had
come into the course with
a certain level of privilege
even more privilege over
other people.”
Amy added: “I come
from the direct opposite
to the privileged, elitist
bubble that this course
seemed to want to protect.
And it's not something I
can stand for.”
Following the problems
with bullying and issues
with her syndicate group,
Amy decided to contact
those in charge of the
course. However, she ran
into countless difficulties.
She grew frustrated with
the continued inaction on
the part of the Business
School. Within the first
two months Amy sent 12
e-mails, to which she re-
ceived no response. Amy
recounted: “I was telling
them I was in a lot of
emotional distress, please
don’t ignore this email. It
wasn’t just casual stuff,
it was ‘I’m hitting crisis
point, please help!’”
It got to the point where
Amy then had to escalate
it to the Dean of the
Business School because
she was still receiving
no response. When they
did finally respond, I had
a Skype call with the
Course director.
“I think generally
speaking, all the way
through I was having a
lot of problems with them
and they just didn’t help
me. They knew that I was
suffering and, in many
ways, they just made it
a lot worse. They were
fully aware that was being
bullied and did nothing to
stop it.”
Two weeks into the
second term, the stress
built again because “the
quality of the teaching
materials was just so poor
again”. The course took
its toll on Amy and left
her really ill:
“By that point I was
really suicidal and just
really depressed and my
partner and I decided
that a major source of
distress was this course.
There was nothing more
that I could do, it wasn’t
going to get any better.
I wasn’t in a position to
accept the poor quality,
I felt that I hadn’t been
treated fairly, I felt that
my reputation within the
cohort had been damaged
and also, it got to a point
where I felt my integrity
was being compromised.
I didn’t want to be asso-
ciated with the course and
I didn’t want to propagate
this elitist mentality of 'it
doesn’t matter about the
quality of the course, of
the teaching etc., it’s all
about the name and the
brand and the reputation
and what people think of
it outside'”.
Amy is still dealing
with the ramifications of
the ordeal she suffered
through. When speaking
to Felix, she mentioned
“I’ve only today just got
a psychiatrist say that I’m
actually now better. It’s
taken all this time for the
depression to go away and
that’s with medication,
therapy, everything and I
had to take three months
off work because of it
aswell so it’s not inconse-
quential to me”.
When approached
for comment, Professor
Francisco Veloso, Dean of
Imperial College Business
School, said: “We are
committed to providing
all students with a world-
class educational experi-
ence, and want everyone
in our diverse and global
community to feel sup-
ported and respected.
It would not be appro-
priate for us to comment
on specific matters
relating to an individual’s
complaint. However
we deeply regret if any
student has had a negative
experience or did not
receive the support they
expected, and we always
seek to learn and improve.
We welcome feedback
from students, and are
always looking at ways
we can enhance our pro-
grammes, currently with a
particular focus on student
experience. Our students
are instrumental to our
aim of innovating, and
their insights have driven
many of the changes
being introduced to our
programmes. Any stu-
dents who would like to
share further suggestions
or concerns are always
welcome to contact me.
We are very proud of
our student body, and
look forward to continu-
ing to work with them to
maintain and develop our
community.”
After self-researching
and having to fight alone,
Amy followed the official
complaint procedures
afforded to her, which
took six months. Whilst
her complaints were all
substantiated, she was left
“profoundly disappointed
by the contrition, empathy
and humanity shown by
the Business School”.
Amy recently published
an article on LinkedIn,
titled, "2018, My Year of
Hell, Thanks to Imperial
College Business School's
Online Global MBA". In
this article, Amy gives
a full account, detailing
her version of events.
She added: “I do want
to be categorically clear
that this is not just my
story. A lot of the things I
was affected by, affected
other students too. I know
other students who have
suffered on this course too
and didn't get the support
they needed. Some even
withdrew too- just more
quietly than me!”
