The Queen of Spades: ROH disappoints
I
t’s been a long while
since I’ve found an
opera more enjoyable
with my eyes shut
than open. But with a
director who says things
like ‘Opera is not about
giving people a good
time,’ perhaps I shouldn’t
have been surprised.
Stefan Herheim’s gamble
with Tchaikovsky’s The
Queen of Spades tries too
hard to be clever, making
for a bewildering, boring
and generally unenjoyable
production.
Instead of Tchaik-
ovsky’s magnificent
overture, the curtains rise
to ‘Tchaikovsky’ perform-
ing fellatio on a prostitute.
This rather distasteful
opening is just the begin-
ning of the humiliation
of the poor composer.
Herheim wants us to view
The Queen of Spades
as the product of Tchai-
kovsky’s struggle with
repressed homosexuality.
To this end, the Tchai-
kovsky figure (played
by Vladimir Stoyanov)
remains on stage through-
out the opera, scribbling
on loose sheets of paper
and mock-playing on
the piano as though he is
writing the events of the
opera in real time.
The midnight confron-
tation between Gherman
and the Countess?
There’s Tchaikovsky,
skulking in the corner.
At the apparition of the
Countess’ ghost? There
he is again, playing the
piano with unnecessary
melodrama. Gherman’s
and Liza’s passionate love
declaration? There he is
too, chivvying the protag-
onists towards each other
like some kind of maiden
aunt. It is completely
distracting. The emotional
intensity of each scene is
utterly lost – something
Herheim clearly intends,
since he has the characters
pretending to sing off
‘scripts’ like actors at an
audition.
The worst part of it is
that this butchering of
the opera isn’t even to
any point. Unlike what
Herheim would have us
believe, The Queen of
Spades is not the invention
of Tchaikovsky’s torment-
ed, gay mind. It was based
on Pushkin’s short story of
the same name mocking
human greed, and trying
to reinvent it as the
product of Tchaikovsky’s
tortured soul just does not
make any sense no matter
how hard Herheim tries.
It’s unclear what each of
the characters signify and
how this is all supposed
to tie into Tchaikovsky’s
homosexuality.
To be fair, it isn’t just
the direction – this pro-
duction suffers musically
as well. Maybe we can’t
blame the singers for
being as bewildered as the
audience. Stoyanov, who
(mystifyingly) plays both
Tchaikovsky and Prince
Yeletsky, was among the
better singers here, with
one of the few highlights
of the evening being his
aria ‘Ja vas lyublyu’.
Aleksandrs Antonenko
as Gherman is another
story altogether. Was he
singing, or shouting? At
first I thought he was being
intentionally discordant
for the sake of acting, but
I soon realised it wasn’t a
conscious decision at all.
Eva-Maria Westbroek,
starring opposite him
as Liza, wavered in her
singing and seemed to
run out of breath in the
longer passages. The one
bright spot was Anna
Gorvachova, who sang
excellently as the side
character Paulina (Liza’s
friend, here ‘reimagined’
by Herheim as her lesbian
lover).
Even Tchaikovsky’s
beautiful music failed
to charm. The ROH
orchestra, conducted by
Antonio Pappano, played
some of the most confron-
tational, unsubtle Tchai-
kovsky I’ve ever heard.
Perhaps Pappano was
suffering from a Wagner
hangover after last year’s
Ring Cycle?
The set was, at least,
technically excellent,
with backlit panels of
bookshelves seamlessly
changing the stage from
bedroom to ballroom.
Visually arresting, the
set designs came across
as slightly histrionic at
times, - at one point the
large chandelier started
swinging across the stage
while spewing smoke,
like Phantom of the Opera
gone wrong.
To prolong the misery,
The Queen of Spades is
hardly a short and sweet
opera. 7 acts long, at the
interval I found myself
wondering how I would
manage to get through
the second half. At times
it felt like we were just
being shouted at – by
Antonenko and Westbro-
ek, by Pappano and the
orchestra, by Herheim
and his harebrained ideas.
Tchaikovsky would
have been rolling in his
grave. Wait – he was
doing quite enough
rolling about on stage
already, being kicked
and jeered at by his out-
of-control characters and
made a laughingstock for
the audience. Far from
being a sensitive explo-
ration of Tchaikovsky’s
mindset and motives,
Herheim’s adaptation is
a disrespectful and disap-
pointing bastardisation of
an opera once described
by Tchaikovsky as ‘my
masterpiece’.
Stefan Herheim’s production delivers confusion in spades
