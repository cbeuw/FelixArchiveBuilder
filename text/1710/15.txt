Roma: a triumph of cinema or the pinnacle of home
viewing?
A ‘Netflix Original’ by nature— it’s a monumental shame that most will not discover this gem on the big screen.
I
have been anticipat-
ing Alfonso Cuaron’s
new film, Roma,
since its warm recep-
tion around the festival
circuit last year. It’s been
six years since Gravity, a
film that swept the board
with its accolades, both
technical and artistic.
After making several
high-profile, comfortably
budgeted, ‘Hollywood’
films, Cuaron brings us
Roma, his first Spanish-
language feature since Y
Tu Mama Tambien.
Roma centres around
Cleo (newcomer Yalitza
Aparicio), a housemaid
for a middle-class family
in the Colonia Roma, a
suburb of Mexico City,
in 1970–71. The family
consists of parents Sofia
(Marina de Tavira) and
Antonio, their four young
children and Sofia’s
mother, Teresa. Evidently,
Cuaron draws from his
childhood, having grown
up in a family like Sofia’s;
these series of events are
full of rich detail. Dubbed
as his most personal film
yet, you can really feel the
grooves of his fingerprints
in the frame.
Cuaron’s 1970s Mexico
City is brought to life
within the shot. Again,
Cuaron employs his trade-
mark “wandering frame”
“Dubbed as his
most personal
film yet, you
can really feel
the grooves of
his fingerprints
in the frame. ”
whereby the camera is
distracted by the stories
of those who are not the
main subjects of the film.
The world that that our
protagonists inhabit is
fully realised and given
context. A scene that plays
out in a furniture shop is
placed in the background
of violent demonstra-
tions, now historically
known as the Corpus
Christi Massacre. Our
protagonists come face to
face with danger—what
started in the background
becomes part of our
story in the foreground.
These shifts of focus
happen throughout the
film to serve to provide
a grounding in reality,
and sometimes a liberal
construction of reality.
Thematically, there is
a lot that you can unpick
from the film, but these
tiny details were made to
be absorbed not studied.
There is a serene and med-
itative atmosphere to the
film like a distant memory,
misremembered. Quirky
moments of absurdity
occur leading to questions
in these conscious choices
in narrative but is never
pretentious. Although
the story ventures into
episodic melodrama, the
mundaneness of everyday
life is also captured. These
moments of stillness in
the scene is complement-
ed by the extraordinary
sound design—part of
what makes this depic-
tion of 1970s Mexico so
full-fleshed is the sound-
scapes. Strong women
characters drive the drama
forward; gender politics
and social issues are ade-
quately presented but are
not the focus of the film.
In essence, Roma is a
family portrait—a slice of
life of an ordinary family,
but this is anything but an
ordinary film.
Cuaron directs with a
quiet confidence. He gets
the best out of his cast; the
two female central perfor-
mances from Aparicio and
de Tavira are astonishing.
The film is, on a technical
level, magnificent. The
framing always adds to
biggest screen (and best
sound system) available.
Many in the film industry
express discontent in the
great debate over “films”
primarily distributed on
streaming services and
their eligibility for “film”
awards. Roma serves to
prove that great cinema
that deserves recogni-
tion is not limited to its
platform—streaming is
the future.

the drama and frustrates us
with more tension. Scenes
are staged with a beautiful
and poetic realism you
can find in modern street
photography. The drama
is never overshadowed by
the technicalities, but the
two combine effortlessly
to provide an overwhelm-
ing experience. Without
spoiling the film, the
scene at the hospital, and
the scene at the beach
are standout moments
that are masterful in their
construction and crafts-
manship.
As for distribution,
Roma is having a limited
cinema release, and
it’s available to stream

theatrical run is not just
a cynical bid for awards
recognition, as Roma is
truly a cinematic film that
