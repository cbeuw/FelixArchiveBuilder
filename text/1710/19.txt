N
ow that the
new year has
started, how
many of those
“new year, new me” posts
have you seen floating
around? It’s nice to think
we can have a fresh start
as soon as the year begins,
but those first few days
up until term restarts are
so much of a limbo, it’s
pretty much impossible to
send any form of resolu-
tion into action. However,
now that we’re more
settled, we thought we’d
tackle a few of the resolu-
tions we’ve heard floating
around, mainly deciding
to save a little money and
budget more, and eat a
little healthier – two birds,
one stone.
We’ve been out on the
hunt (Google), and have
managed to round up the
best of the best. Whether
you’re looking for an
indulgent breakfast, or a
nourishing hearty lunch,
we’ve got all the recipes
that aren’t going to harm
your bank account or your
figure!
Breakfast
Catharina’s Protein
• 100-200ml cup milk*
• 1 teaspoon cinammon

Method
1. Mix the oats and
baking powder
together
2. Mash in the banana
with a fork.
3. Add in the milk
slowly, and keep
whisking till desired
consistency is
achieved.
4. Grease a frying pan,
and add enough of
the mixture to create
a thin base, and once
bubbles start forming,
flip the pancake.
5. Enjoy!!

“Whether
you’re
looking for
an indulgent
breakfast, or
a nourishing
hearty lunch,
we’ve got all
the recipes
that aren’t
going to harm
your bank
account or
your figure! ”
Method
1. Add the egg, egg
whites, mushrooms,
bell pepper, onion,
salt, garlic and half
the cheese into a
12-ounce or larger
Mason jar coated with
cooking spray. Shake
or stir to combine,
then seal with a lid
unless making imme-
diately.
2. Place in fridge over-
night or until ready to
prepare.
3. Remove lid, place
in microwave, and
heat for about two
minutes, watching for
overflow. If the eggs
puff up too much,
simply open the
microwave for five
seconds, then heat
again until no liquid
remains. Top with
remaining cheese,
and serve. Top with
avocado, if using.
Lunch
Cassey’s Healthy
Method
1. Preheat oven to 375
degrees.
2. Place all ingredients
for falafel (except for
the pitas and nonstick
spray) in a large
bowl, and give them
a good stir. Using a
potato masher, mash
well. Mixture should
remain slightly
chunky, not smooth.
3. Spray a baking sheet
thoroughly with a
two-second spray
of olive oil nonstick
spray.
4. One at a time, take
spoonfuls of mixture
in your hands and
form 15 balls, each
about the size of a
ping pong ball, and
gently place them
on the baking sheet.
Spray the top of
each ball with olive
oil nonstick spray,
for a total of about a
two-second spray.
5. Bake in the oven for
15 minutes. Mean-
while, combine all
ingredients for dip
in a blender or food
processor, and pulse
until just blended.
Season to taste with
black pepper and
refrigerate until ready
to serve.
6. Remove baking
sheet from the
oven, and carefully
turn each ball over,
gently reshaping if
the bottoms have
flattened. Return to
the oven and bake for
an additional 10 – 15
minutes, until golden
brown and slightly
crispy. Allow to cool
and set for at least
five minutes.
7. Cut the whole pitas
into halves, toast or
warm all pita halves
slightly, and then
fill each with three
falafel balls and three
tbsp. dip. Enjoy!
