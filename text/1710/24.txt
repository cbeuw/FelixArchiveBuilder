LISBON - is the hype real?
T
he plane prepares
for landing by
circling the
beaches, vast
kilometres of deep blue
waters and white sand
dotted by sun-lovers, it
makes its descent by over-
looking the city and its
hills. If this isn’t a scenic
landing, I don’t know
what is.
Lisbon truly offers
it all. And I’m not just
talking about the custard
tarts. It is hard to write
about something you so
passionately love.
Lisbon’s city centre
is not like many others
in Europe. The streets
are wide, with intricate
pavement patterns (known
as calçada), the buildings
are made of colourful
tiles, the yellow trams go
up and down the hills, nar-
rowing into the traditional
old neighbourhoods of
Lisbon. You’ll find over
30 beautiful terraces and
hilltops overlooking the
city and the river, where
both tourists and locals
meet for drinks, thoughts
and long conversations.
You’ll find a lot of street-
based shopping, from
high street brands to inde-
pendent quirky shops. Old
versus modern museums
and cathedrals, some lost
in the city depths (Basílica
da Estrela) others sitting
riverside (MAAT).
Being a waterfront city
means you can get away
from the overwhelming
city sounds by strolling
riverside. There are plenty
cafés, bars, restaurants,
nightclubs and parks
along the river for one to
pick from, sit down and
relax or dance the night
away. Take the train for 30
minutes, swap the traffic
sounds for seagulls and
waves, the warmth kissing
your skin, a cold drink
in hand, you’ve found
the ocean. For fairytale
enchanted stories, head
over to Quinta da Rega-
leira or Pena Palace, in
Sintra, both UNESCO
World Heritage Sites, and
get lost in its caves and
magical wells, romantic
and warm-colour palaces.
We do things slowly in
Lisbon, after all the best
things in life must appre-
ciated. Food, for instance,
is one of those things. We
dine late and we love to
stay at restaurants long
after the meal has ended,
just drinking and chatting
for possibly too long. If
there is outdoor seating
we might actually stay
forever. So apologies
if you find yourself in
a queue! Best advice:
embrace the Portuguese
way.
speaking Portuguese too
loud (yes, even louder,
and as if that would help
anyone understand…).
People will want to know
about your life, where you
are from, what you do,
what brings you over. Not
because we are nosy, but
because you’re new.
Lisbon is becoming in-
creasingly touristy – many
say this with criticism, I
say it with appreciation.
People still go on about
their lives (don’t really
have a choice do they?),
but still go out at tradi-
tional and new places,
still visit all the above and
many other locations that
one could consider tourist
attractions, still love their
city. I believe that this
is what, above all else,
makes the hype real about
Lisbon. You feel like
you’re part of the city and
its life. And for a greater
feeling of belonging go
when we’re happiest –
April to October. But I’m
obviously biased.
