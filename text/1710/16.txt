The Destiny Divorce - Activision and Bungie Split Up
GAMES

B
ungie and
A c t i v i s i o n
Blizzard started
their partnership
in 2010 after Bungie
gained their independence
fromMicrosoft.Activision
had in place a 10-year
contract with the aim of
helping Bungie launch
their first project after
Halo – Destiny. However,
this 10-year contract has
now been cut short with
Bungie now assuming
the full publishing rights
of the Destiny series.
With the control of their
IP completely back in
their own hands, we can
only wait and see how
the Destiny series moves
forward.
Activision’s
responsibilities for the
Destiny franchise. Going
forward, Bungie will
own and develop the
franchise, and Activision
will increase its focus
on owned IP and other
projects. Activision and
Bungie are committed
to a seamless transition
for the Destiny franchise
and will continue to work
closely together during
the transition on behalf of
the community of Destiny
players around the world.”
Activision’s statement
appears to indicate an
amicable and friendly
split, but if rumours are to
be believed then Bungie
could not be happier with
having full control of their
IP. Rumour has it that
champagne was popped
by Bungie staff after the
announcement was made.
Activision in the past
have publicly called out
their disappointment with
the earnings of Destiny
2: Forsaken with their
Chief Operating Officer
Coddy Johnson said that
the earnings had failed
to meet their standards.
A Bungie developer had
fired back publicly to this
statement:
Comments from
strained relationship that
we’ve seen over the past
9 years of their contract.
Activision expected
Bungie to release a new
destiny title every two
years from Autumn
of 2013, but as we all
know, Destiny 1 shipped
in 2014, with Destiny 2
having gone live in 2017,
which makes Bungie a
title behind Activision’s
schedule. From
Activision’s massively
known franchise “Call of
Duty”, strict production
schedules are a classic for
Activision releases. So in
some ways, this divorce
could be Activision
accepting that Destiny has
not panned out to be the
franchise it expected from
their contract.
It’s no understatement
that Destiny has a long
and arduous road to get to
where it is today through
the numerous expansions
and updates during its
lifetime, which at times
have left us Guardians
with feelings of joy at the
new content but annoyed
at other times for splitting
the player base and letting
the microtransactions
slide straight to our
bodies.
Tough times for
Activision
Activision is truly
going through rough
times though, with
customer backlash and
a drop in their stock
prices back in November
after announcing Diablo
Immortal for mobile
phones instead of a full
PC title. Additionally,
they have abandoned their
Skylanders franchise, so
coupled with Destiny,
Activision’s harem of
mega-franchises has
grown smaller.
The future for Bungie
A Chinese online
game company called
NetEase, which
publishes Activision’s
“ O v e r w a t c h ” ,
“Hearthstone”and“World
of Warcraft” games in
China has invested $100
million in Bungie for non-
Destiny related IP titles.
Now that Bungie are
in full control of their IP,
the industry landscape
allows many options for
the developer to continue
their development of
future instalments for
their baby without the
need of a publisher. They
now no longer need to
stick to the strict release
schedules which could
pan out well Guardians.
Let’s hope that Bungie
can now restore the light
to the 10 million active
guardians. This will also
let us see whether or not if
some of the issues which
plagued Destiny were
from the developer or by
executive meddling from
the publisher.
The 10-year contract, started in 2010, has not been seen through to the end. Guardians, the future is changing.

“When we first
launched our partnership
with Activision in 2010,
the gaming industry
was in a pretty different
place,” Bungie wrote in its
post. “As an independent
studio setting out to build
a brand-new experience,
we wanted a partner
willing to take a big leap
of faith with us. We had a
vision for Destiny that we
believed in, but to launch
a game of that magnitude,
we needed the support of
an established publishing
partner.”
