Season of change
T
he Plant-Based
Imperial cam-
paign combines
initiatives from
Greening Imperial,
Environmental Society
(ESoc), VegSoc and
Animal Protection
& Education Society
(APES). The main aim of
the campaign is to reduce
the carbon footprint of
the college and work
towards a more sustaina-
ble college. Throughout
January and February
Imperial will be holding
various events relating
to meat consumption and
sustainability (see the
accompanying timetable).
On Mondays and
Fridays between 12-
2.00pm, there are pop-up
stalls in JCR and SCR so
as to get engage the com-
munity and get feedback
on Meat-Free Mondays.
Comments and opinions
are welcomed.
A screening of
Carnage will be held in
the Grantham Institute
on Wednesday, 23rd of
January. A satire mock-
umentary by comedian
Simon Amstell, Carnage,
set in a meat free future,
makes light of both vegans
and meat-eaters of today.
On the 26th VegSoc is
organizing a trip to the
FRIEND animal sanctu-
ary, where you can muck
in, for instance cleaning
chicken sheds or helping
livestock which have been
rescued from abusive
owners or found aban-
doned. There are limited
spaces. Email vegsoc@
imperial.ac.uk to register
interest.
Is veganism healthy?
This is a question that
often draws a great deal of
empassioned but also un-
substantiated debate. UCL
and Imperial students
have begun a campaign
to make at least a half
of food consumed at the
university vegan by 2020.
This campaign is launch-
ing with a talk on nutrition
at UCL on the 28th. Well
worth attending if you
would like to be involved
or are considering a vegan
diet. Also a chance to see
the “other” university.
Should the production
of meat be banned? Expect
a heated debate right
here in Imperial, as four
experts come together in
early February to discuss
this proposition.
Last but certainly not
least, “Earthling Ed”, an
influential activist with
over 9 million views on
Youtube will be visiting to
Imperial in late February.

Oddly inspiring
I
’d like to believe that
every one of us, at
least in part, can do
something better for
the environment. But I
also know that for some,
this can seem dauting,
difficult, or just too time
consuming - which is
why, I thought I’d share
my experience with
ODDBOX, a UK based
company committed to
tackling food waste. One
of the United Nations
sustainable development
goals is halving the per
capita global food waste
by 2030. Yet, globally
1.3 billion tonnes of food
produced is being wasted
every year. In UK alone,
3 million tonnes of food
(1/3 of the total produce!)
don’t even reach the
super market shelves,
simply because they are
vegetables from local
growers and markets at
a fair price and deliver
them to people all across
London, including areas
near the Imperial campus.
This not only reduces the
amount of produce going
to waste but also supports
local farmers. Besides,
these fruits and vegetable
didn’t have to fly or sail
across the ocean to get
to us, ultimately reducing
the carbon footprint.
Personally, what I’ve
loved most about Oddbox
is that they provide a
variety of produce, all
of which are seasonal;
this means getting the
opportunity to cook with
unfamiliar ingredients,
such as rainbow carrots,
hispi cabbages, and purple
sprouting broccolis.
Even cooking with them
is made easy, as every
Oddbox delivery comes
with a simple recipe for
potential meals that can be
made using the contents
in the box that week.
The boxes are also con-
veniently delivered right
outside the house, so the
excitement of waking up
every Thursday morning
to unravel the unknown
contents of a new oddbox
waiting outside my
doorstep feels almost
like a weekly Christmas
present. This also means
that I don’t have to spend
time walking to and
around the supermarket
for grocery shopping.
Another excellent feature
which I appreciate is the
fact that unlike every
single fruit and vegetable
unnecessarily dressed
from head to toe in plastic
at the supermarkets,
oddbox deliveries are
hardly ever wrapped
in any plastic (with the
exception of Spinach!);
They come straight in
cardboard boxes which
are reused or recycled,
variety of order options,
including veg only, or
a combination of fruit
and veg, and in sizes of
small, medium and large.
A small veg and fruit
box is probably ideal for
college students to last
for a week, and only costs
10.49 pounds for a hearty
quantity. Payment is on a
weekly basis, so you can
easily cancel any time
you travel or simply don’t
have time to cook.
With Oddbox, you’re
not only saving money
and making your life
easier, but also con-
tributing to solving the
global food waste issue
and other environmental
problems. It starts with
just one delivery.
