Death Register: a review
Death Register is a book about growing up in Montego Bay, Jamaica. I enjoyed the book but hated every single
character in it.

Death Register is a
novel outside my literary
comfort zone. It follows
the formative years of
Chauncey Knuckle and his
group of friends, growing
up in the city of Montego
Bay. It explores their
relationships with their
peers, their families and
their teachers against the
intensely homophobic and
patriarchal background of
Jamaica in the 90s.
Chauncey’s story is
directly driven by the
conflict between himself
and his best friend Tristan.
Tristan is a homosexual
and, while working
together, Chauncey
witnesses him being
sexually abused by their
employer. Chauncey fails
to do anything, either to
report the incident or to
intervene on his friend’s
behalf, which Tristan
is aware of. Tristan and
Chauncey also experience
direct academic rivalry
at the elite private school
that they have attained
scholarships to. Chauncey
excels as a writer, but
struggles with mathemat-
ics, while Tristan is nat-
urally gifted in this field.
These different factors
drive resentment between
the two, in addition to the
struggle that Chauncey
feels when it comes to
accepting his friend’s
homosexuality.
The men and boys
throughout this novel
are portrayed in a mostly
negative light due to the
author’s interpretation
of toxic masculinity in
Jamaica,tothepointwhere
the main characters are
fundamentally unlikeable.
Fathers beat their sons
with the flats of machetes;
the sons are all revolting
perverts, misogynists
and bullies and the main
character has a penchant
for both writing about
and employing sexual
violence against his girl-
friend. I’m beginning to
feel a little exhausted with
this particular character
trope; if mums can get
off to the idea of a rapey
man then maybe it’s about
time we did away with
this stereotype to avoid
making characters into
unintentional parodies of
Christian Grey.
One of the key themes
in this book is intoler-
ance of homosexuality.
Words like “battybwoy”
and phrases such as “no-
homo” crop up all over
the dialogue. The climax
of the book, or at least one
of the climaxes, occurs as
a result of Tristan being
caught having sex with
one of the male school-
masters. He is beaten
up and then referred to a
cultish schoolboy secret
society that passes judge-
ment on such matters. He
is tried in absentia and
expelled from the school.
Anyone associated with
him is ostracised from
their peers, save one of his
friends that is alleged to
be gay but makes a speech
at the trial rejecting gay
rights as incompatible
with human rights. All in
all, pretty fucked.
There are other impor-
tant themes throughout the
book, such as the conflict
between the wealthy and
the poor. Homeless people
are ruthlessly exploited by
the wealthy for sex, with
homeless men engaging in
sex acts with the local big
men and women working
in the aforementioned
brothels.
The ending of the book
was mostly lacklustre.
Tristan is shot by corrupt
police officers as a result
of his involvement with
a drugs gang. Chauncey
reflects on his relationship
with Tristan and admits
that he was not entirely
honest with himself or his
friend as he loved him. I
never really felt that this
degree of affection was
effectively demonstrated
by the author’s writing
and, instead of leaving me
with a sense of sadness at
this unrequited affection, I
felt absolutely nothing.
I didn’t really em-
pathise with either – or
indeed any – of the
characters. They all felt
almost entirely flawed,
tied together by a series
of events that seemed to
emerge out of the smog
of the narrative. It felt
like, in trying to portray
Jamaica in its entirety,
the author brought much
of what should have been
background into the fore-
ground. The plot lurched
from event to event and
the characters then failed
to react in a believable
manner. I felt like the
story would be much more
interesting were it written
from Tristan’s perspec-
tive, as he is a character
that would be far easier to
empathise with.
That does not mean
to say that this is a not a
book you should read. It
exposed me to a degree
of toxic masculinity that
absolutely made me un-
comfortable and consider
my own behaviour. The
innovative style by which
Chauncey both experienc-
es and writes about events
in the book is interesting
and exposes more of
the character without
engaging in prolonged
internal monologues.
It is a rich portrayal of
a Jamaican city in the
90s and contains some
profound sections and
characters. The strong-
est example of this is
Chancey’sAunt.Although
beautiful, intelligent and
compassionate, she is
barren and as a result
has settled for an abusive
Jamaica – looks pretty // Flickr
boyfriend. She is possibly
one of the only characters
in the book that I liked
and I found some of the
dialogue written for her
on misogyny to be rather
wonderful.
Overall, Death Register
is a book that I was not
ready for. Although I was
aware of the degree of
homophobia present in
Jamaica, I was unaware
of the extent. I must
also admit that I found
the portrayal of the
character’s life and their
attitudes towards women
very much at odds with
my own worldview and
experiences. That being
said I think that this book
raises important questions
about masculinity in
Jamaica and masculinity
in general. It probably
was not really suited for
a sheltered white boy like
myself.
