gene therapy project in St. Mary's

St. Mary's, a constituent college of
Imperial College, is said to be

be prepared to follow any approach
in this field'. (iCNN)
Phones
British Telecom may have lost
hundreds of thousands of pounds in
a fraud discovered at Nottingham
University. It is believed that people
from all over Nottingham had been
using two faulty payphones in a
University flat since the beginning
of the academic year. Last year a
number of people were heavily
fined at Warwick University after
a similar incident. (Warwick Boar,
Warwick University)

Rugby Tackle
The Dean of St Mary's Hospital
Medical School, Profesor Peter
Richards, 'rugby-tackled' a thief
last Monday. Professor Richards
told Felix that T saw a young man
just coming out of my office... and
when I asked him what he was
doing... he made a dash outwards.'
Professor Richards then 'went for
his legs' and the thief was then
taken back into the Dean's office
where he was questioned.
The thief then made for the
window, at which point Professor
Disaffiliate
The largest eight colleges of the
University of London are
attempting to gain independent
status and are said to be afraid that
their titles and reputations are in
danger from polytechnics who will
be able to gain university status in
the near future. It is believed that
any institution having a 'lesser'
name would be perceived as a
'lesser' institution.
These plans have angered some
of the other institutions in the
University of London who fear its
break-up. The colleges involved
Richards grabbed his shirt, which
came off. After a chase around the
'moat' which encircles part of the
building, the,thief made off, only
to be caught later by a St Mary's
student. He has been charged and
was found in possesion of £60 from
the Dean's wallet and a number of
credit cards.
The Dean said that he had not
been seriously hurt, but had
suffered a few bruises from the
tackle. He thanked all those who
had helped him catch the thief.
include Imperial College, Birkbeck,
Goldsmiths, Queen Mary and
Westfield, Royal Holloway,
University College and the London
School of Economics.
Theplans are aimed at allowing
the institutions to use the title of
university in any fund raising
activities or when discussing
mergers with other institutions. At
present it is felt that many people
are confused by the titles and the
polytechnics' plans to change names
will only add to the confusion.
Doctor Proposals
The Dean of St Mary's Hospital
Medical School, Professor Peter
Richards, presented new proposals
for junior doctors in the British
Medical Journal today. Issued on
behalf of the Council of Deans for
UK Medical Schools the proposals
are said to include several radical
recommendations.
At present medical students who
have passed their degree course,
spend one year as junior doctors
before becoming fully registered
with the General Medical Council.
The proposals detailed in the British
Medical Journal plan to increase
this period of working as an intern
to two years, and decrease the
length of the university course by
one year. A move that would reduce
student debt and ensure that junior
doctors could not work 90 hour
weeks common among Interns.
The cost of the scheme has not
yet been fully worked out, but it is
believed that removing the need for
overtime would offset any cost
involved, together with the obvious
benefit of improved patient care.
Simon Stockhill, President of St
Mary's Student Union, said that the
move was part of a rationalisation
of the way Medical courses are run.
He continued that the proposed
changes would be controversial,
and would require an input of
money from Government.
Poll Fail
Warwick University Students'
Union will be holding a new
election for some sabbatical and
non - sabbatical posts, as
Candidates representing the Labour
group overspent their election
budget by £30.
Members of the Labour camp
were in tears when the decision of
the Election Committee was
announced last Tuesday night.The
new election could have serious
reprocussions for the Students'
Union. The winner of the last
election for President, Ian Corfield,
may lose his post as there was only
200 votes between him and his
nearest rival, Kevin Turnbull.
Overseas
Hundreds of overseas students
lobbied the Houses of Commons
last week complaining about
,exorbitant college fees and their
forced exclusion from political
activity. Douglas Wong,
Communications Officer at
Manchester University, told the
London Student that even lobbying
parliament could jeopardise their
visas and that overseas students
were only allowed a visa if they had
£5000 in a bank account. He said
that the reason given was that this
was the cost of living in Britain and
added that it was notable that the
home student grant was half of
this.(London Student)
Speakers
Two speakers were stolen from the
Lounge Bar on Tuesday. The pair
are worth about £120 and the
owners, 'Positive Promotions,' say
that they may close down their other
operations in the Union if they do
not get them back. This includes the
juke box and the games room
machines. Any information would
be gratefully received on 0860

applied for the position.
