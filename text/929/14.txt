Imperial College justifiably
considers itself one of the finest
engineering and technological
schools in Europe. In recent years
it has increased its links with other
universities in continental Europe
and an increasing number of
exchange students stay at our
college, yet the student union and
the student body do not have an
organisation that can encourage and
support further exchanges, and
contact other student organisations,
in similar universities on the
continent.
An ideal way to start is to use
BEST and its network as a working
group within the Student Union.
The Board of European Students of
Technology is an organisation
already in existence. It was founded
several years ago, initially with
Imperial College representation, but
interest faded and college
representatives were no longer
present at meetings. BEST as an
organisation grew stronger, though.
It gained new members, organised
the first summer courses and held
several general assemblies.
Imperial College BEST group
was set up at the beginning of this
academic year. It managed to start
functioning due to the kind financial
support of the college's
International Relations Office. This
allowed us to attend the BEST
general assembly held in Lisbon.
The central structure of BEST and
its 'Summer Programme' are being
partially funded by the E C scheme
TEMPUS. The local groups, which
are the real soul and spirit of the
organisation, need to finance
themselves. BEST at Imperial
College is up and running. We have
had students from Lund, Lille,
Tallinn, Paris and Barcelona
visiting us, and we will be having
students attending student festivals,
seminars and careers fairs abroad.
Naturally once the association is
fully established within our student
union, these opportunities will
become available to a greater
number of students.
The BEST group at IC holds the
rotative Presidence of BEST and is
the current secretariat, an
information centre which is
responsible for the printing of a
monthly newsletter. BEST will
provide a good opportunity for IC
students to influence as well as
participate in the links with students
in continental Europe.
The Association
In April 1989, BEST, the Board of
European Students of Technology
was founded in Berlin by students
of 20 universities from all over
Europe, with the philosophy 'To
promote Europe among
Europeans'.
BEST is a non-profit, apolitical
organisation meant to be an answer
to the need for communication and
exchange between technology
students across Europe.
The Network
There is an established network of
local BEST groups at the individual
universities. Information regarding
the possibilities of studying abroad
for any given period of time is
provided, and work is done to
improve the international exchange
opportunities by cooperating with
university administrators, industry
and the government.
Practically, it provides permanent
and live contact with the student
The 'Job-Shops'
Invitations are sent out to the local
groups, allowing students to attend
career's fairs held at many of the
member universities. This provides
final year students with the
possibility of looking for jobs
outside their home country, and
others a chance of obtaining a
summer job abroad, something
which is becoming increasingly
important as we approach 1993.
The Events
Continuous up-to-date information
on 'What's happening in Europe!',
including free invitations to most
events: European weeks, student
festivals, cultural extravaganzas,
unions of Europe's top technical
and scientific universities. It can be
a link with all our students enrolled
in courses with a 'year in Europe'.
Additionally it provides an
increased 'East-West' cooperation
at a student level.
The Summer Progamme
The BEST Summer Programme
which took place for the first time
in 1991 and was a great success,
will continue through 1992. It is a
Joint European Project supported
by the European Community
programme T E M P U S . It consists
of a series of short intensive courses
held during the summer period,
which specialise in a specific field
of science and technology. These
are attended by students from all
universities within the B E S T
network and include cultural and
social programmes, enabling the
participants to learn about and
experience their surroundings.
The two main goals of the
programme are:
• To increase the undergraduate
student exchange in Europe.
• To promote the importance of
international cooperation.
The practical benefits include:
• A unique two week cultural
exchange with most European
countries.
• An opportunity to experience
student life in a very different
society.
sports competitions, international
forums and debates. Just to name
a few of the possibilities.
Student Exchanges
These can be of all types. In the past
they have ranged from one day get-
togethers to year-long studies.
Some members have gone as far as
to complete their whole degrees
abroad.
In general, increased
undergraduate student mobility has
been achieved through closer
cooperation amongst the different
schools.
Cultural Awareness
B E S T has constantly been a
mediator between cultures, uniting
students with different backgrounds
and with them their universities.
Thus opening a wide and new array
of ideas and possibilities.
Students have learned to better
appreciate their own schools and
have been inspired to strive towards
a greater understanding of other
students' lives.
