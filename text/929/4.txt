Editorial Felix 929 6 March 1992
The newspaper of the Polytechnic
of Central London. McGarel had a
report this week on the theme of
academic establishment name
changing, one of the many bees in
my bonnet. In defence of my
indefensible plagiarism, I should
say that McGarel seems to have
done a lot of research on the subject
and replication of the same would
be pointless (please don't sue - we
ain't got no money). In addition I
have nothing to write about this
week.
The whole subject of name
changing ought to be viewed with
amusement rather than anxiety - in
addition to those already mentioned
we have the following polytechnics
transmutating - Hatfield to the
University of Hertfordshire, Leeds
to the Leeds Metropolitan
University. South West to the
University of Plymouth, Thames to
the University of Greenwich. City
of London to the City of London
University (as opposed to the City
University, which already exists),
the Poly of North London to the
University of North London,
similarly for the Polys of East
London and of West London. Bang
goes my theory that Imperial will
become the University of West
London.
You may or may not be aware of
various rumours whizzing about to
the effect that Student Unions may
cease to be a 'closed shop' as part
of the Conservative Government's
continued campaign against all
things Scargillesque. This is termed
'voluntary membership of a union'
and would mean, in effect, that the
funding which now automatically
goes to Student Unions would go to
individual students. Something like
an extra £5 per year for each student
- which could be used to join the
Union or to buy x pints of beer,
until the Government decides to cut
this money as well. The reasoning
goes that
a) all students are part of the
NUS - the National Union of
Students;
b) NUS is but one letter
different to N U M ;
c) both tend towards the
political left:
d) closed shops contravene the
laws of heaven and earth, therefore
e) they should be heavily
stomped on.
There are a number of flaws in
this argument -
a) not all students are part of
the NUS, thank god. For instance,
IC students aren't.
b) this is entirely true.
c) this is also true, but in the
case of the NUS they are doing an
excellent job of destroying
themselves. They need no help.
Anyway, being generally leftie is
not a good reason to be dumped on
- I draw your attention to the NHS
Sultans of Ping
If you've got your ear to the
ground, you'll have heard 'Where's
me Jumper?' by Cork's Sultans of
Ping FC. They're daft and they're
a laugh & if you fancy lying on the
floor kicking your feet in the air,
then come along to the Sultans
special showcase gig at the Union
tofiight. Advance tickets are only
£2.50, £3.00 on the door. This is
the most prestigious gig at IC since
(I feel that the Conservative Party
Cental Office policy may be to
abolish all three letter acronyms
beginning with 'N').
d) I am ambivalent on this. If
it came to a choice between a
student Union and several scores of
packets of crisps, your average
student would go for the latter. If
that is want they want, I feel it
would be arrogant to preach
otherwise, though it is very
shortsighted to bankrupt your own
student Union only to realise later
that quite possibly it may have been
useful.
The blame for such disinterest in
the Student Union lies partly with
the Union itself, in that it is not seen
as 'worth its salt.' the blame for
which, in turn, lies with the student
population for not getting involved
in it. or being aware of what the
Union does. Should the Union
become a vast self publicising
machine' I think not.
Perhaps if the students here were
to vote with their money in the
future and abolish the Student
Union, that is totally reasonable.
After all. it would be true
democracy. You decide who next
year's Sabbaticals will he - so you
decide how well next year's Union
will run. Let's not have any of this
'the Union is crap' nonsense - it is
only crap if you let it be.

Strange God
Levitation last year so haul ass
down the lounge. As usual, there's
a coke bar and disco.
Top boffins at Ents H Q have
generated a random number
between 1 and 500 on the ents
supercomputer. If you buy this
ticket, you will win a fab Sultans of

that.
Dear Adam,
I was interested to browe through
the eclectic article by H.Lee (or
Robert Pirsig of 'Zen/Motorcycle'
fame). However, the concluding
remrks, in particular, offered a
strange view of 'God'.
What is the point of a 'God' who
can't be defined, and absolute truth
that can't be used? I know
mysticism is becoming more
popular, but such thinking can
never solve man's problems. If the
answer to 'Is there a God?' is yes,
but also no, as he/she/it is
undefinable, we have not answered
the question at all. Combine this
with the lack of absolute moral
values to line by and we may as well
be humanists, and get arrested for
selling dodgy videos.

Election stuff
Dear Adam.
It is inevitable, I suppose, that the
name of ents will be bandied around
by prospective candidates for the
post of Hon Sec (events), and the
proposals made by Messers Fenner
and Allen are, I'm sure, well
intentioned. However, it does
irritate me that both candidates are
so blatantly ignorant about an area
of union activity for which they
intend to assume overall
responsibility.
Aled Fenner suggests that T C
Events have been excessively biased
towards' house/rave music. Well,
Aled, for the record, by the end of
the year ents will have put on four
carnivals (two of which included a
rave), at least six gigs, three
comedy nights, one rave and
countless discos (which usually
feature some rave music). Bias?
Hardly. M r Fenner, do some
research.
Both candidates express a wish to
see bigger acts at IC and Mr Allen
correctly identifies the license as the
primary obstacle. Neither realises,
however, that a serious attempt was
made to solve the problem and
frankly, we can't. (If anybody is
interested in the details I'll provide
them.) As for 'up and coming
bands' these are the staple diet of
the college circuit. After all, who
are Rain, Pele, Spitfire, etc if not
up and coming? Mr Allen, do some
research.
The manifesto promises made by
Hon. Sec. candidates relating to
ents are meaningless. If you want
some sound advice, vote for Nick
Allen, whose proposals to
computerise room bookings and
appoint a permanent ents officer
will make the post virtually
redundant.
Yours,
Graham Lawton. Ents Chair
