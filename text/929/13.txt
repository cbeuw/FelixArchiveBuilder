A case of advanced syphilis in Costina asylum
Above all the overpowering
stench. It had not been uncommon
for dead bodies to be left lying
around for large periods of time.
Yet again the thought crossed my
mind of what the Allied forces did
when they opened the gates of
Ravensbruck and Auschwitz. In
certain instances I could have quite
happily machine gunned the lot of
them.
The orphanage at Ionaseni housed
200 children with a wide range of
physical and mental handicaps.
When the first British group had
arrived here they had been told by
the locals Tt is better that you leave
these children to die—they are
nothing more than animals'. Several
months later a convoy of trucks had
been surrounded here by 250 angry
villagers demanding relief aid for
themselves. Some swift diplomacy
resulted in loss of clothes and food
in return for retention of essential
medical supplies.
In the winter it had not been
uncommon for one child a day to
die here, exposed to the - 3 0 ° C
blast that comes straight from
Siberia to the North. The bodies
were saved up in the morgue for a
mass burial on Saturdays. The death
rate here was reduced by almost
100% by the simple expedient of
putting some glass in the windows.
Inside you might have been
forgiven for thinking that the
children were animals. Yet again
with two or three to a cot it was not
uncommon for children to be 8
years old and not be able to walk
and speak. One of the more pitiful
examples I saw was of a sixteen
year old girl, whose age I
incorrectly guessed at 8 because of
her diminutive size, holding a
kitten. She had just had a baby by
one of the orphanage boys and had
been told that she could keep the
baby when she could look after the
kitten.
Now of course the situation is
different. An army of occupational
therapists, speech therapists and
doctors from Britain is working full
time there and getting amazing
results. Anyone who has seen the
documentary 'Challenge Anneka'
and seen the before and after results
of the orphanage at Siret will be
familiar with what a little hard
work, patience and above all
understanding can achieve.
My own institution for this
Christmas was in a place called
Zvoristea. Right in the North of the
country, it sits about ten miles from
the border with Soviet Moldavia.
This part of the world is not having
it particularly good at the moment.
With the break up of the USSR,
spiralling inflation, the Russian
winter and an average wage of three
dollars a month, life is more of an
existence than an enjoyable
experience. The only people
making any serious money are
businessmen, priests, taxi drivers
and whores (6 dollars all night for
a good looking one so I'm told).
Set in this guagmire is the special
school. Two hundred children
including 80 orphans in vacation
time. They get a basic education
until the age of 16 when they are
sent to another school to be trained
in vocation skills such as metalwork
or shoemaking.
A programme of relief work has
ensured that for the most part, the
children get enough to eat, and have
shoes when they run about in the
snow. The main problem in places
like this is that the children lack the
necessary mental stimulation to
develop properly. As any biologist
can tell you the human brain
reaches its maximum level of
sophistication at about the age of
three. Absence of such basic forms
of interaction such as play can have
a profound effect on the child in
later life. Romania has a
particularly bad human right's
record in this field. After the war
the International Charter for human
rights for children was set up,
which included a clause stating that
one of the basic rights for children
was the right of play. Romania
(although she was not alone),
refused to sign this clause. At the
time Eastern bloc states were in the
habit .of removing children from
parents at an early age to be
indoctrinated in the 'socialist way
of life'. Presumably play did not
come into this. The effects of this
sort of deprival are very distressing
to witness. Children will sit in
groups and rock to and fro for hours
because they have nothing better to
do.
This situation is not irreversible
though. It is quite astounding to see
the progress made in a child by
giving them paper and crayons and
asking them to be creative. The
learning of life skills that we would
take for granted is also very
necessary, for instance how to flush
a newly installed toilet, or that
wiping your arse on the floor is not
healthy. The education does not end
there however. Persuading the
supervisors not to beat the children
with iron bars is also sometimes
very necessary.
Christmas at the orphanage was
fun and the New Year even better.
The Romanian New Year has to be
seen to be believed. The festivities
last about a week. The entire
country takes to the streets, dressed
up as goats and bears going from
door to door where by unwritten
law they must be received with
hospitality, which normally
involves large quantities of vodka
or tsuica, which is Romanian plum
brandy brewed illicitly in stills in
the back garden.
In Romanian folklore, whenever
a bear appears in a story it is always
called Martin, in the same manner
in which foxes are always called
Reynard in France, or Brer Rabbit
in Uncle Remus etc. For this reason
I was soon christened by the
It was not

to die here
children as Mors Martin (old man
bear). The villagers soon became
used to the sight of 'the crazy
British', roaming through the streets
of Zvoristea, accompanied by
droves of small children, screaming
loudly, only stopping to torture
local cats or make demands for
sweets or ice cream.
The community Doctor soon
became my good friend. A fluent
English speaker, she was constantly
hampered in her ability to practice
medicine by the fact that she could
not get the appropriate drugs. One
of the more touching examples was
the day I was able to supply L-Dopa
to a local man with chronic
Parkinsonism. Three days later his
symptoms had improved
dramatically, and presents started to
appear from the village for me.
Alas it was all too soon time for
me to return to London and
'normality'. But I will go back, as
will hundreds of other volunteers
who find the people and the country
addictive. However this takes hard
cash. To send the group from
Mary's and IC last summer cost
over £5000. This year it would cost
more. If in the depths of your
student debt you could spare the
price of one pint of beer to help
what is known now as the fourth
world, you could rest safe in the
knowledge that your money will be
going to a very good cause.
