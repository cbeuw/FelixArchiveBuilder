Feature Felix 929 6 March 1992
'When I got lost on my way to the
interview, still more than three
thousand miles away from tropical
East Africa, I knew then that I was
going to need every last ounce of
initiative to get through the Frontier
expedition. And later, smiling like
a martyr at the nurse at the Health
Centre while she ladled vaccines
into my upper arm, it was obvious
to me that my physical and mental
resources would be taken to the
edge. Pain, hardhsip, deprivation,
and missing Brookside, I was
prepared for all that. I was ready to
restrained, but suddenly we had
found ourselves in the thick of it (no
not that), with wild (and I mean
furious) chimpanzees charging
about the forest canopy above our
heads, shaking branches and
whooping and screaming like' they
were holding an acid house party.
Actually most of the chimps
couldn't seem to make up their
minds whether they wanted to be
angry, to be frightened, or just to
eat the fruit. Either way, it seems
they defecate abundantly through all
three of these states, so all was well

me.'

Tanzanian Coastal Forest
Project
The Frontier expeditions have been
running in East Africa for almost
three years now, and the Society for
Environmental Exploration, which
co-ordinates the expeditions, is
constantly recruiting young people
who have a taste for adventure, an
ability to raise sponsorship and who
won't get lost on the London
Underground. Living conditions in
field camps are rough and makeshift
and expeditions demand versatility,
tolerance, enthusiasm and initiative.
These qualities tend to serve better
than academic qualifications when
it comes to manoevering a four-ton
truck out of a ditch.
All expedition work is directed in
the long-term towards the
conservation and protection of
natural habitats such as tropical
forests, coral reefs and mangrove
estuaries. Projects are developed in
partnership with the relevant
wildlife authorites and research
institutions of the host country to
ensure that the most urgent national
conservation priorities are
addressed. In order to be effective,
the projects are set up on a long-
term basis. Nonetheless, each
expeditionary group has its own
assigned objectives. Within that
context there is an unending variety
of tasks.
'Chimpanzee dung they said they
wanted. Nobody, it seems, gets
more excited about animal crap and
zoologists. As a geography students
my own enthusiasm was more
for thejob in hand. I sneaked a look
over the huge buttress roots that
sheltered me and saw Simon
crouched in the leaf litter frantically
consuming leaves from a nearby
shrub. Strange behaviour you might
think for a civil engineer from
Portsmouth, but in fact a gesture
greatly respected by irate
chimpanzees. Certainly the dung
samples were going to be difficult.
On the one hand, here was a prime
opportunity to get some fresh
samples, but on the other hand if
one of us moved, the chimps, some
of which were right over our heads,
shrieked louder than ever. What
could we do? Where could we get
some shit? Just then I reached
behind me for my rucksack, but
instead of canvass my fingers met
something warm and yielding and
as they did so I was suddenly aware
of a violently rich and fruity aroma.
I spun around, and there on the lid
of my rucksack were three generous
splashes of something that looked
like peanut butter left out in hot sun.
By some miraculous stroke of
fortune, one of the chimpanzees had
actually dumped right on my bag,
right by my side. Incredible luck.
We needed dung samples, and
they'd fallen right into our lap. And
some people wonder if God is good.
Does a bear shit in the woods?'

Kibale Forect Project
The aim of the Frontier Project in
Kibale Forest in western Uganda is
to establish, in conjunction with the
Uganda Forest Department and
Makerere University, a tourist and
education centre on the edge of the
forest. Tourists who will visit the
forest to see the chimanzees and
walk the trails, will generate
valuable foreign currency that is
essential to the long-term survival
of the Forest Reserve. Amongst a
variety of other work, Frontier
volunteers have been collecting
dung samples from the chimpanzees
on behalf of Makerere University
Field Station who supervise
behavioural research in another part
of the forest. The samples are sent
to Harvard University to test the
hypothesis that the density of
nematode worms in the dung is an
indicator of how much stress an
individual chimpanzee is suffering.
If this is the case, the work will
provide invaluable baseline data
against which to monitor, in the
future, the disturbing effects on the
chimpanzees caused by the
introduction of tourists into the
forest. The level of tourist activity
can then be regulated accordingly
and disturbance to the wildlife kept
to a minimum. Frontier's work at
Kibale began in July 1991 and is
expected to last for at least two
years.
Other Frontier projects in Uganda
and Tanzania are involved in
similar kinds of conservation
activity. These include the
establishment of Tanzania's first
Marine National Park around Mafia
Island, and compiling species
inventories for Tanzania's coastal
forests. Work varies broadly from
digging latrines and counting
millipedes to map drawing and
diving on some of the most pristine
coral reef in the Western Indian
Ocea. It is also likely that projects
in other parts of the world will be
initiated over the coming year. If
you would like further information
on the conditions of participation on
one of the ten week expeditions and
would also be capable of raising the
contribution to expedition costs,
