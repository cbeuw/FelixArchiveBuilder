6 March 1992 Felix 929 Opinion
Perhaps you were one of the
millions of people who dipped into
their pockets and gave money to
Comic Relief last year. But did you
know that it only took 8 hours for
the £20 million that was raised to
flow back into Britain in the form
of debt repayments? This simple
fact gives the sad lie about aid.
It is time that we asked who really
benefits?
Britain spent £1.68 billion on aid.
If you were to judge, by
Government statements, or disaster
pictures on T V , you could be
forgiven for thinking that this figure
amounted to a generous flow to the
needy of the 'Third World'.
Perhaps the image that best sums up
British aid is Lynda Chalker,
Minister for Overseas
Development, distributing sweets to
the Kurdish children, as they stood
shivering on the mountains of Iraq:
a 'sticking plaster' solution to much
more fundamental problems.
In reality, the total amount of
world aid is half what Britain
spends on its social services, and we
are one of the World's meanest
countries when it comes to aid as
a percentage of Gross National
Product (GNP). The target set, by
the United Nations, is 0.7% of the
GNP. At the moment, Britain falls
far short with its contribution of
0.31 % and no plans for achieving
the full target. If you look at the
quality and direction of British aid.
it becomes clear that altruism is not
the motivating factor behind the
giving.
Most of Britain's aid is bilateral:
it involves the direct transfer of
money, goods, or services to the
Third World. This is a double-
edged sword. Aid is an effective
way of influencing governments
and furthering the interests of the
donors, and is certainly not
allocated to the poorest countries of
the World. In 1985, the year of the
Ethiopian famine. £18 million was
given from the aid budget to repair
a Gibraltarian dockyard. The same
year, each inhabitant of the
Falkland Islands received the
equivalent of £5,000, whilst India
received only 15 pence.
Britain also benefits from 'tied
aid', which amounts to about 75%
of bilateral aid. By tying aid, donors
insist that money given can only be
spend on goods and services from
their own country, and (you've
guessed), it is usually much more
expensive to buy products with tied
aid rather than on the open market.
Remember the Westland Helicopter
crisis of 1986? That year, India was
told that it had to spend £65 million,
from its aid money on 21
helicopters. These designs were
totally unsuitable for the Indian
conditions: aid had been directed
towards helping an ailing British
industry!
In 1986 Chris Patten, then
Minister for Overseas
Development, put it plainly when
he noted that the aid programme
was 'a significant part of our export
efforts'. Apart from pure financial
conditions, tied aid reinforces the
dependency of the 'Third World' on
rich countries. Governments are
forced to import foreign goods and
this stops them developing their
own industries.
A second part of the 'aid web' is
multilateral aid given, by Britain,
to international bodies, such as the
World Bank, and the United
Nations groups such as the World
Food Programme. Lynda Chalker,
in 1990, boasted that British
Companies received £1.75 worth of
orders for every £1 that the
incapacitated that cities are blacked
out for up to twelve hours per day.
In India, many communities are
protesting against the Narmada dam
funded by the World Bank. It seems
that past lessons have not been
learnt.
Where do we go from here? By
now, you may be feeling thoroughly
disillusioned but it is important to
remember that many of the non-
Government agencies, such as
Oxfam and Christian Aid, are being
more critical of the type of aid they
give. Local communities in the
'Third World' are also getting their
voices heard, and the Government
is increasingly being pressurised
into channelling its aid more
appropriately.
It is also worth putting the aid
issue into perspective, and
remembering that it is only a small
Aid; who really benefits?
Government put into
multilateral agencies.
Multilateral aid bodies tend to
fund large scale, high technology,
prestigious projects. It is hard to see
how the benefits trickle down to the
poor, whose lives are supposed to
be improved by all this aid. Huge
dams might provide electricity for
those who live in towns, but the
majority of poorer people in rural
areas would probably prefer access
to fuels, such as wood or charcoal.
They might argue that sustainable
forestry would be more appropriate
to their needs.
Over the years, enormous sums
have been spent on hydro-electric
dams. These were heralded as the
key to developing energy, for local
industries, yet little account was
taken of the livelihoods of the
thousands who would be displaced
. as their land was flooded, or the
environmental damage that such
projects cause. The Peligre dam, in
Haiti (one of the World's poorest
nations), is a case in point. Only a
few years after completion, this
dam has silted up and is so
part of the overall picture, at present
accounting for only 5% of all
income in the 'Third World". World
prices for raw materials and debt
repayments are what really
determine how a country fares. In
1985 the total amount of emergency
aid to Africa, from all sources, was
around $3,000 million in debt
repayments, and £19,000 million
was wiped off the value of African
exports because of a price collapse
on world markets.
It is these forces, rather than aid,
that keep poor countries poor.
Changes are needed in the richer
more powerful countries where the
heart of the problem lies. That is
where organisations, such as Third
World First, come in. By educating
people on the root causes of poverty
and underdevelopment, and
campaigning for change here, a
valuable start has been made. You
too can help shift the balance of
power!
