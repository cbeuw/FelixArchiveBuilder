Eggleston and Van Gogh
I have to admit my ignorance as I
didn't know who William Eggleston
was until now. He is one of
America's most influential and
pioneering colour photographers.
He lives in the deep south and this
is reflected in most of his work.
The exhibition features nine
themes: Graceland, Southern
Suites, Election Eve, Interiors,
Wedgewood Blue, The Louisiana
Project, Industry and an African
Trilogy. I found there to be nothing
profound in most of his work, it was
sharp yet dull in content and
composition. The work is all of a
similar vein, the subjects being
mainly objects of modern living and
the nature that surrounds us.
To me this made for rather boring
viewing. The intensity of colour in
the photographs raises the subject
out of its mundaneness and the
quality of a 'snapshot'.
Eggleston is undoubtedly a
professional with flawless
Gogh's favourite artists. Alongside
these works are a few of Van
Gogh's own. The pieces displayed
are Peasant Heads 1884, Weavers
1885. A Pair of Boots 1886 and
Road Along the Seine at Ansiers
1887. together with extracts from
his letters and personal
memorabilia.
As you may have guessed, this
exhibition boasts the credibility that
his time spent in England helped
create Van Gogh-the artist.

technique.
After walking round the
Eggleston exhibition having studied
each photograph intently and having
given serious thought to it (believe
me if you like), there was enough
time to inspect the Van Gogh
Exhibition on the lower floor.
The exhibition focuses on Van
Gogh's formative years when he
arrived in England at the age of 20,
in 1873. At that time he was
working for art dealers in Covent
Garden.
The major part of the exhibition
is a selection of paintings by Van

Roman and Mary's
Last Friday I went along to see this
play at the Theatre Offstage in
Camden (I hate Camden). The
Roman is the Roman soldier who
guarded Jesus on the night before
he was crucified and the Marys are
Mary Magdalene and the B . V . M .
(that's the Blessed Virgin Mary for
you heathens). Anyway, kinda
topical with Lent and all that
(what's Lent cry the heathens!).
Well let me say first and foremost
that this is an excellent play. I was
gripped. It is mainly Mary M and
the B . V . M . telling their stories.
Mary Magdalene had a sad old time
and suffered all the abuses that men
can sling at a woman. And then she
met Jesus. She describes the abuse
and pain of her life with graphic and
chilling words and her soft scouse
accent is great (to be said/read in
scouse). Well, I liked it anyway.
She met Jesus and she felt clean
again, and she saw love and warmth
in his eyes.
Mary Magdalene and the B V M (title courtesy of Jojo)
It all sounds quite orthodox up to
now. But Christians beware. Waly
K. Daly has a new way of looking
at the B . V . M . story and opens the
question as to who Jesus was.
Actually, the B . V . M . comes across
as a cow of mega proportions. She
certainly believed her son to be the
,son of God and was gonna make
damn sure that all went according
to plan (God's plan that is). The two
Marys hate each other 'cos they
both see Jesus in different ways.
I suppose this play could offend
christians but personally I think a
challenge of ideas and beliefs is a
good thing. Even if you're not into
the theological significance of the
theme, just go for the brilliant
performances of Barbara Ewing and
Helene Kvale, the moving
soliloquies and the powerful
writing.

D a r w e n
Blood
Wedding
Except for the obligatory Chekhov
and Brecht. productions of foreign
plays are relatively rare. 'The
greatness of a writer is in direct
proportion to the power of his
country,' said Louis Bunuel and so
we miss out on brilliant writers just
because they're not American or
British (or Russian or German )
Therefore, The About Time
Theatre Company deserves credit
for staging 'Blood Wedding' by the
great Spanish poet Frederico Garcia
Lorca. But it is always a challenge
to make a foreign play work and
I'm afraid this production does not
succeed.
In the play, a bride runs away
with her former lover at the end of
the wedding ceremony leaving
behind her and the bridegroom's
stunned families. Lorca had read
about such an incident in a
newspaper years before he wrote
the play. He turned the theme into
a highly poetic, surreal drama, and
a very Spanish one indeed. The
director, Yuval Zamir, i s mistaken
when he thinks he could eliminate
Spain from the play and replace it
with mere artiness. Its setting is half
imaginary anyway, featuring
characters such as The Moon and
Death. If you take away its Spanish
culture, its link to the real world,
then how can you believe the story?
I was left completely untouched.
They murdered the play.
What makes it really painful is the
acting (with the exception of
Michele Hunter as the servant
woman, the only living character on
stage.)

I must apologise for the lack of any
film reviews (namely 'Cape-Fear')
- I hope no-one walked away with
the press tickets. Back to normal
next issue, I promise. On the point
of film reviews - if someone wants
to do one, come and see me in the
Felix office on a W e d n e s d a y
afternoon between 2.00pm and
6.00pm (allowing me to get some
lunch), and I'll tell you what I have
available. It's first come, first
served I'm afraid. See you soon -
