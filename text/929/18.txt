Tho usand Yard Stare -
Astoria
Trash, Helium
Divers
Arriving late (Due credit to London
Underground for that) I entered the
Astoria to find those crazy Corkish
(?) maniacs, The Frank And
Walters, halfway through their set.
Consequently, I know not what
Spin were like, or whether the
Frank & Walters played their cover
of 'Love Is In The Air.' Oh well.
When I got in, they were halfway
through the lead track of EP2,
'Fashion Crisis Hits New York',
their purple and orange flares
billowing in time with the music.
Stepping up to the mic, they say
Frank and
Walters
-EP3
Another creative title from Cork's
finest export, the EP opens with
'Happy Busman', which is about a
guy called Andy James, who 'drives
a bus' hence the busman part, and
will 'make the whole world smile',
hence the happy part. A very public
spirited approach to life, and a bit
of a stomping song. Followed on
with 'Humphrey', who thinks
everyone should 'study mime'.
Another distinctly storming song,
though not quite as good as the first
track.
On the other side (if you buy it
on vinyl, and remember, I do want
you to buy it) is the bestest track
yet, 'The World Carries On', and
then 'If You're Still Waiting'. If
you're still waiting, out of sheer
politeness to the lecturer who
you're not listening to, then make
a mental note in capital letters to go
out on Monday and buy it. Get into
the orange and purple scene. I will
be making spot checks on Monday
afternoon, just to check that you
have done as you're told.
Frankly, dear heart, it's Corking.

• EP3 is released on Monday on
Setanta/Go Discs. A flexidisc
featuring 'Humphrey' and 'We are
the Frank & Walters' is available
from Setanta Records, 123
Shakespeare Road, London SE24,
by sending your name and address,
and two first class stamps.
'Waaaaar thaaaare Fraaaaank aaan
Waaaaaaters', which my
experienced ear translates into an
introduction. They add other such
incomprehensible babble
throughout the set. They proceed at
an all but leisurely pace through
'Daisy Chain', 'The World Carries
On' and 'Walters Trip' before
ending with 'Never Ending
Staircase.' Frank And Walters are
something special. Can Thousand
Yard Stare follow this?
Err. Not really. As they take the
stage, and run through the opening
chords of 'Junketing', a girl behind
me says 'This is it, yeah?' That's
the problem with being so close to
Essex, I guess. Thousand Yard
Stare run through their album in a
pretty workmanlike manner,
sprinkled with extracts from their
earlier EPs not included on the
album, flavoured with the odd
comment such as 'ssshh, you're
spoiling the vibe', and wrapped up
in 'Wideshire.' They return for two
encores, the first containing
'Comeuppance' and 'Buttermouth',
and second something else. But the
FranA' and Walters blew them away.
And most of the previously
unaffiliated crowd agreed with me.

• The album 'Hands On' is out
now. and was reviewed in last
week's Felix.
Frank, Walter and Walter
a sixties hangover as it were. Their
songs contain lyrics such as 'When
Rosemary falls, she falls in my
garden.' I detected a distinct hint in
some of their songs for a yearning
to be Eric Clapton, and the
occasional lapses towards those
perennial Felix darlings. Airhead.
Not bad really. Not as bad as
Airhead, anyway.
Trash, on the other hand, are
quite sure who they want to be.
They are certain, sure, positive,
inflexible even, in their desire to be
Jesus Jones. The difference between
this and what their predecessors
desire, is that Jesus Jones have only
ever influenced one other band
(EMF), and that Trash managed to
keep me awake. Not really too
much to ask, is it?
There was another band, but they
were reduced to dust by their
support. Trash are worth seeing.

Spinal Tap
- Bitch School
This is Spinal Tap
This must go down as the most
successful piece of press in history.
It is absolutely amazing, after their
previous twelve albums (so they tell
us) this single is released a couple
of weeks before the new 33 entitled
Break like the Wind', oh what
lovely people. This may seem
amazing but that is nothing
compared to my reaction upon
listening to this piece of vinyl
history, I actually quite liked it! It
may not be the most open-minded
song around, you probably
wouldn't have guessed that from the
title, but they can actually play.
Despite the loss of a drummer when
he spontaneously combusted in
Japan, an a keyboard player that
met an equally fiery end the band
lumbers on. One question remains,
is this Spinal Tap?

mSpinal Tap's new album, 'Break
like the Wind' is due out in
approximatly three weeks.
