Music Felix 929 6 March 1992
Blue Salamander,
Pheasant Pluckers
- Fulham Swan
Black Magic Box
Blue Salamander was a pretty odd
sort of rock/blues band. They were
completely unprofessional at times
and fluffed things the way a school
band might, and than at times they
plugged into a source of
transcendental cosmic grooviness
and you thought, hey, man, this is
like, totally, like, you know, good
shit. Their cover of 'House of the
Rising Sun' was firmly in the Good
Shit category, and their original
material (when you ignored the
screw ups) was most certainly
Heavy Duty Good Shit, I reckon the
best stuff I'd heard in ages. The lead
guitarist, who was kind of furry,
distinguished himself by playing
some solos which wandered all over
the place, but usually got there in
the end, very much like a heavily
tranquilised B B King, and that was
kind of funny. And the versatile
male singer/sax player/mouth harp
player was a hip dude with shades
who could have passed as a New
York pimp. Said dude chose to put
his vocal cords through the shredder
only on one song, which sounded
superb as a result; the rest of the
time he sang he was strictly school
band level. The female vocalist was
excellent. Blue Salamander are a
band with a lot of potential, and I'd
like to hear them again when
they've got more practice under
their belts, and when they have
some more original material,
hopefully of the same calibre as
their present stuff.
The Pheasant Pluckers were the
other end of the professionalism
spectrum. They played rock
ranging from heavy to hard to
raunchy to rockabilly with
incredible Frank Zappa tightness,
with routines that were nevertheless
often slickly improvised between
band members. Technically, they
were effortlessly capable at
everything they did, and oozed
competence. Pity none of the
material they did really stuck out the
way the previous band's did, but the
people in the pub (a vaguely rocker
crowd) seemed to appreciate the
astonishing difference in standard,
and asked for, and got, an encore.
Worth the two quid.
PJ
Right then, sweeties, an especially
large box for you this week,
because you've got an especially
long wait until you next have a Felix
to 'read.' Tonight, The Sultans Of
Ping FC in the Union, supported by
Herb. Herb are excellent. Ents are
gits.
Why?
For scheduling this gig on the
same day that the equally excellent,
early Primal Scream-ish Scorpio
Rising play at the Marquee,
supported by Sensitize.
Tomorrow, those sweet, lovely
popsters Candyland spend an
intimately poppy evening at the
Borderline, and Iceland's
Sugarcubes sing a few numbers
from their latest album, and a
couple, no doubt, from the other
two, supported by Levitation, who
played here last year. Oh, how the
mighty have fallen.
Monday night/Tuesday morning
brings a bit of a treat to your T V
screens. ITV proudly present
Raindancer, one of London's finest
unsigned bands on 'Stage I.' The
catch? It's on at 4.30 in the
morning. Time to find a video, I
think.
o, My diRe load 104.9
Some people consider me a sad
case. There was a time when I
showed great potential, I was
without doubt heading for hipdom.
I was seen dancing myself into a
frenzy to the likes of the Pixies and
Jane's Addiction in the dingiest of
dives, the future was looking better
than my bank balance and I'd even
managed an approving smile from
the forever elusive girl in the goth
skirt. But in the end I gave up the
ghost and blew it all for the pocket
full of lullabies that is Melody
Radio, the 24 hour easy-listening
station that has more versions of
'The One Note Samba"' than you
could wave a shitty stick at.
Laugh at me, ridicule me, throw
weighty items in my general
direction but I'll be judged by He
who is far greater than any students:
James Last. Shopping mall music,
elevator music, wallpaper music,
call it what you want (please try
your utmost to keep it clean) but
more and more young ravers are
fuming to the right end of the dial
for the want of something a tinge
more distinct. Aimed at the 'past it
and over' age group Melody finds
itself bridging the generation gap in
ways that only re-runs of
Thunderbirds can. Okay, some may
argue that the imitation of the latter
is not as obvious as that of the
former from Radio 1 and Capital,
these guys are positively human.
Melody is gonna be big, those
cultured on high-speed rave music
are going to tire themselves out and
easy listening is where they'll go to
find their solace, maybe. You think
I jest, you think I'm one member
short of a parliamentary think tank,
you may be right but until you've
tried it for yourselves you're not
going to know.
Melody can be awful, songs full
of the corniest of cliches, endless
harmonies that make the Beach
Boys out to be Nirvana in Hawaiian
shirts and cover versions of
perfectly reasonable songs
bastardised beyond belief by some
big band orchestra from the
Republic of Godonlyknowswhere,
but it has to be said that bad taste
has its charms and appeal.
Easy listening is every student's
dream, it's cheap and accessible
(most chains of Oxfam have buckets
of the stuff), it's got alternative and
weird written all over it (and a
student who isn't trying to be
perceived as either of these things
ain't worth the paper his/her union
card is printed on) and it's got guts
for walking on the thin line between
beyond a joke and the sublime.
Before this begins to sound like
a promotion job I, Keith, of sound
body and mind, advocate that
Melody be piped throughout the
underground, including the tubes
themselves, that all telephone hold
systems are on line to it, that all
major chain stores use Melody to
induce us to spend beyond our
means and that you give it a going
over.
Melody Radio is broadcast on
104.9FM.

Tuesday brings a great selection
of free entertainment, in the shape
of the rather resplendent My Life
Story, with an 'all-star supporting
cast' (Hup!) at the Marquee, and
Trash, a pop dream at QMW. Free.
Take your student card, or they
won't let you in.
Next weekend, Red Hot Chilli
Peppers promote their new single
with a couple of dates down in Sarf
London, at the Academy, one of
London's nicest venues.
And finally, U2 saboteurs The
Joshua Trio cause chaos at the
Marquee, a week on Tuesday.
Achtung Baby.
