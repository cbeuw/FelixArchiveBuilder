The Arts Week..Gallery
Running for three weeks (2nd-20th
March) The Arts Week will be
using the Consort Gallery (Sherfield
Ante Room, Ground floor) to
exhibit the work of a number of
Artists. The display will include
prints, paintings and drawings.
Simon Burder's work is ruggedly
geological, an investigation of
textures and structures in rocky
landscapes. Jeffery Gibbons and
Joanna Melvin produce abstracts of
power and considerable feeling.
Ruth Hogg makes prints containing
The Arts Week
exceptionally subtle colour
shadings. Possibly the most unusual
work on show is that of Kaori
Homma who works with layered
mulberry paper - sounds interesting.
The Arts Week...Classics
Every lunchtime (9th-13th March)
at 12.45 to 1.15pm. Classical music
will echo round the Sherfield foyer
near the SCR. The rundown is as
follows, Monday: An informal Part
Song Singalong, Tuesday: Bach
Flute Sonatas with Harpsicord,
Wednesday: Jazz double bass and
piano duo, Thursday: A selection of
songs from Shakespere by Thomas
Arne, with Oboe, Recorder, Strings
and continuo accompaniment,
Friday: Bach and Telemann Sonatas
for two recorders and continuo.
Alternatively listen to a string
quartet and a flute duet who will be
performing in the Union Building
some lunchtimes during The Arts
Week.
The Arts Week...Gigs
The Mech Eng foyer is hardly the
venue you would expect for a Rock
Band but that is what The Arts
Week has arranged for Tuesday
10th March. Classic rock tracks
will be performed by the only band
willing to play in a corridor.
Thursday 12th March (lunchtime
in the Union Lounge) sees the
return of 'Fresh Claim' who have
perfomed at The Arts Weekfor the
last two years. They're back by
popular demand and no doubt will
perform some of their classics along
with some new material.
'Trevor Speaks' and Ben Okalore
continue the musical entertainment
on Friday 13th March, again in the
Union Lounge. 'Trevor Speaks' are
a duo much in the style of the now
disbanded Fat and Frantic. Should
be wild.
The Arts Week...Comedy
Comedians Mark How and
Rupert Smith will be entertaining in
the Union Bar on Wednesday 11th
from 8pm onwards, then on
Thursday and Friday lunchtimes (in
the Union Lounge) Steve Turner
will be the 'poet in residence'. Steve
Turner has been at The Arts
Weekbefore and far from being a
boring poet has entertained his
audience with humourous poetry
from his books. This year he will
use material from his new book
(soon to be published).
The Arts Week...Busking
Juggling, reciting poetry,
singing, clowning, and all sorts of
wacky entertainment will be
happening round Beit Quad and the
walkway throughout The Arts
Week. Also on Friday in Beit Quad
there will be burgers and hopefully
(fingers crossed) a bouncy castle.
Many of the Artists who are
performing or exhibiting their work
are Christian, some perform at
established events like Greenbelt.
But don't worry they won't be
ramming religon down your throat,
just providing the entertainment.
All the Arts Week events are free.

When the first 'Arts Week' took
place, we were keen on poets but
wondered how they would go down
at IC, so we put them on with bands
to sugar the pill. In the event, the
poets have been a highlight of 'The
Arts Week'. Last year we had
three, and this year decided to invite
Steve Turner back as 'Poet in
Residence'. (Is this a new 'The Arts
Week' accolade, I ask myself?)
Steve has just written a new book
to be published next month by
Hodder & Stoughton. Its called
'The King of Twist'. I asked for
more info (thought I might get a
draft), but all I got was the cover!
Still, the content will be revealed,
no doubt, at 'The Arts Week' so I
suppose he doesn't want to give
anything away - he might lose some
punchlines!
'The King of Twist,' his fourth
collection of poetry, combines the
immediacy and humour of his
earlier books with a sharper, more
mature vision. In these new poems
he takes on the fears and pressures
that threaten to lead us into a dull
conformity and explores the 'wise
madness' that offers a way out. As
N M E said of his last volume:
'When you've read this book you
feel as if he's given you something
positive to hang on to in a world so
uncertain of its uncertainties.'
What the critics say of earlier
collections:
'Steve Turner is witty, there is
some sharp wordplay and he
succeeds, I think because he
confines himself to those subjects he
• feels involved i n . ' - Roger
McGough
'Steve Turner's poems should be
printed on bus tickets, beermats,
matchbox labels, on giant hoardings
across the city. They are gentle
slogans for all the causes he believes
in.' - David Ward, New Musical
Express.
'Within a few pages I felt that in
him contemporary London may
have found a lyric writer in the way
that New York has Steve Sondheim
i and Liverpool used to have
Lennon..' - Peter Lewis, Daily
Mail'
I suppose that we should expect
good quotes on the cover but, from
an IC point of view, what else can
we say except that last year we liked
him so much that 'The Arts Week'
has invited him back, not just again,
but to do more! You can't get a
better recommendation than that.
Come and hear him on Thursday
and Friday of 'The Arts Week'.
Paul Brice.
