Dear Adam,
It is now 4 o'clock on Saturday
morning February 29, 1992 and we
have just finished clearing up after
one of the most successful
International Nights ever.
Much to our surprise, tickets for
the event were sold out a day before
and yet we had a great number of
people queuing to get in on the
night. This in itself is quite an
achievement, particularly when you
consider that a mere team of about
twenty people were minding the
event and over 1100 tickets were
sold.
The night began with the
traditional food fair in the Main
Dining Hall where numerous
overseas societies within the college
were given the opportunity to
present their culinary skills.
Although the attendance was so
high, over 1900 portions of food
were consumed and there was
adequate supply for everyone who
managed to find a ticket. I am
particularly grateful to the vice-
chairman of the OSC, Gil Barzilay
and the two other co-ordinators of
the fair, Yen Yang Lim and Rupa
Patel for their hard work and time
which they put in.
From the food fair, the crowds
were drawn into the Great Hall for
the Cultural Show. Here, a number
of the societies sought to display
their culture by way of dances,
plays, songs and musical interludes.
The Hall itself was full almost
instantaneously and those who
could not obtain tickets were
allowed to sweat out their tears in
the disco which was started
simultaneously in the JCR. With
over 100 people involved in the
show it would be impossible to
thank each one individually. I owe
thanks to all of them for their
patience and co-operation during all
rehearsals and, of course, the
performance itself. Without their
dedication the show would never
have been such a success.
Special thanks must go to the
organisers, Geetha Ratnasingham
and Nee Phua, the technical
management of Chin, Esther and
their crew and the hard working
stage crew co-ordinated by Anjali
Saini. I must also mention the
Indonesian society whose
commitment towards the show was
unbelievable.
The event concluded with the
sounds and beats of 'KARIBA'
(spelling?), one of the most lively
african bands I have experienced
(thanks Stephane) and the
continuation of the excellent disco
provided by IC radio in the JCR.
Adam, it is times like these that
I really am proud of being part of
such a committee. The massive
effort produced by each one of the
members over the past weeks has
been astounding and the amount of
work put in by each national society
which took part was fantastic.
However, there are (as usual) a
few matters of concern:
Firstly, I found it extremely
discouraging and annoying to
discover only a few days before the
event that the union had suddenly
decided to hold a disco on the same
night. Sadly, even a low entry fee
of 70p was not enough to affect our
ticket sales although I am sure this
was not intended.
Secondly, I still fail to understand
why so few 'home' students take
interest in the events which we
organise. A majority of ticket
holders were overseas students
from all over London and I
personally find it that the 'home'
student population of this college
takes such minute interest in our
activities.
Although I hope this will change
in the future, none of the new
sabbatical candidates seems to have
mentioned Overseas students in
their manifestos.
Aside from these worries, I
would once again like to thank all
those who did attend this event and
all those who participated and
helped make it such a huge success.
I, particularly, enjoyed organising
International Night '92 and I
encourage all those who wish to
help next year to join the Overseas
Students Committee in the
forthcoming elections.
Yours sincerely,
Gaurang Chadha,
OSC Chair 1991-92
