Artist's Note.
The prat wearing the IC badge is not
only the editor of Broadsheet who
printed 'Niggerbasher' and finds
telling racist jokes to a Pakistani
ticket collector funny enough to
consider them worth
printing, but also you!
You are to blame for
not voicing your
opinion for allowing
such idiots to represent
you and for being you!
I hate you all! I can't
wait till my three year
sentence in this shit-
hole is over.
