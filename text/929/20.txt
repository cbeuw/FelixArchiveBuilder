I like New
This week. Film Soc present 'The
Fisher King', which is a recent box
office hit, starring Jeff Bridges and
Robin Williams, and directed by
Terry Gilliam.
When New York radio DJ Jack
Lucas (Bridges) accidently drives a
listener to commit mass murder, by
an off the cuff statement, his show
ratings and career fall apart. Three
years later he is rescued from
suicide and muggers by a deranged
tramp called Parry (Williams)
whose wife had been killed by the
murderers provoked by Bridges.
Parry, a former history professor
has two ambitions: to retrieve the
Holy Grail and win the heart of
Lydia. played by Amanda
Richard Dickens. The soprano
soloist in the Mahler symphony will
be Marie Vassiliou.
The concert will start at 8pm in
the Great Hall, Sherfield Building.
Tickets are available in advance
from the Haldane library priced
£1.50 for students and £4 for adults.
Tickets will also be available on the
door priced £2.50 for students.

Plummer. Bridges feels he can
redeem himself by bringing Lydia
and Parry together.
It is a spectacularly visual film,
both romantic, despairing and
lunatic. Come along on Thursday
12th March at 7.30pm to Mech Eng
220. and let Film Soc transport you
to a world fantasy and intrigue, that
even a thermodynamics lecture
can't emulate. Entry is 80p for
members and £ 1 . 8 0 for everyone
else.
As a post script, may I pass the
committees appreciation to our
members who have supported Film
Soc in their droves this year. We
hope you've enjoyed the films as
much as we have.
Another month. another
tournament. Sunday March 1st
1992 saw the 3rd Annual Student
Tournament in Fareham
(somewhere on the coast).
Imperial's 'borderline psychopaths'
were there, and in numbers, to
dispossess Portsmouth Polytechnic
of the title they've hogged since the
tournaments started - that of
National Student Champions'.
Not satisfied with just the one
team. Imperial sent two. Pitted
against them were Portsmouth Poly.
Bristol University, Luton College
(see FELIX 14-2-92), Godalming
College, West Kent College and
Aberystwyth. Eight teams in all,
and it would have been nine if the
Wales team had bothered to turn up.
Nevertheless, there was still at least
one Welsh team to thrash the leeks
out of (and yet more leek-thrashing
will occur, I expect, at Twickenham
tomorrow).
And so to the paint jobs. Imperial
1. despite a sterling performance in
the unofficial student tournament
last month, were only seeded third.
This served only in putting more
pressure on the hot favourites. West
Kent. It also heightened Leo
Happy Boy' Hume-Wright's 'bad
feelings'. The curtain-raiser for the
event turned out to be the match
between the Imperial teams.
Imperial II started in grand style,
holding IC I off (for a while) and
even being ahead on body count. A
small miscalculation (small in
comparison to, say, a sperm whale)
on their right side let IC I's 'Vague
Boys' through to grab the flag.
Sixty points to IC I, and a further
thirty points time bonus.
Scoring for the tournament didn't
follow the normal 'points-per-man'
rule, but relied on speed of victories
for bonus points. Therefore, a
victory in less than five minutes
gave a total of 100 points, in less
than ten minutes 90 points, and so
on down to 60 points for a (fresh
and) clean victory.
While IC I had a bye, IC II
bounced back from their initial
defeat by creaming (steady on Mr
Keogh) Aberystwyth convincingly.
Quite a stunning result given the
Welshmen's performance in the
latter stages of the tournament.
Portsmouth signalled their
intentions of keeping the cup with
a 100-point result against Bristol
(the day's cannon fodder).
As for IC I's performance, it got
better as it went on, and on, and on
(Ariston?). A point of note was IC
I's performance against the
Welshmen. At that point, it looked
like a closely contested battle for the
top three places - between IC I,
Portsmouth and Aberystwyth. IC
I's last two games were against
them, and so the final outcome of
the placings would depend on IC I's
ability to finish in style. And it
nearly didn't happen against
Aberystwyth.
In an action which nearly won
him the 'Ponce-of-the-day' (I mean,
major, big-time cretin points)
award, an Aberystwyth player
reached into the IC I base to secure
the flag, while holding his own flag
which he had just appropriated from
the recently-departed Brett 'I'm
screaming in more ways than one'
Iverson. Bad move. Own goal. Both
flags were in the IC I base, and so
IC scored an easy sixty points from
the jaws of an imminent
embarrassment (of the defeat kind,
and possibly the nappy kind too -
right Luke'?).
IC I's last game was crucial to IC
II. They needed to beat Godalming
in less than five minutes, and hope
that IC I did the business against
Portsmouth, to get into the placings.
As it happens, it happened. IC I
demolished Portsmouth in a mere
115 seconds, losing no one, and IC
II trounced Godalming, leaving IC
I top of a very sorry, wet (did I
mention the Bangladesh-standard
rain levels?) pile and IC II tying
with Portsmouth Poly for second.
In an intense but extremely
satisfying decider, IC II came
through for second place.
And so Imperial College mauled
Portsmouth's ego by entering the
tournament for the first time and
carrying away the top two places.
More gold-coloured thingies for the
trophy cabinet, and general kudos
(no, not something you do in white
jammies in the gym) and back
patting to all those who turned up
to kick some bottom. And for once,
not IC Il's collective bottoms (nice
bottoms that they are too).
An extra-special mention and
grateful thanks to those raunchy
love-machines the 'Vague Boys',
Kevin T have an armoury as big as
my ego' and Tony 'I'm to sexy for
the lot of you but I'll sleep with you
all anyway'.

1st Imperial I 610 points.
2nd Imperial II 330
3rd Portsmouth Poly 330
4th Godalming College 320
