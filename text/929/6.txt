Opinion Felix 929 6 March 1992
The state of the Halls of Residence
is appalling, and the standard of
accommodation, utilities, safety and
security cannot, by any reasonable
standard, be called 'value for
money'.
Accomodation has been a major
student problem this year. Students
groups and hall committees have
complained and protested about
what they regard as a worsening
crisis. Imperial Overseas Students
Committee voiced their anxiety in
a letter to the man with ultimate
responsibility, Gordon Marshall.
The letter is quoted from above. On
February 3rd, high level
representatives from Selkirk and
Tizard Halls took the death ride to
Sherfield to meet with College
management on the subject. They
came, they talked, they were
walked on.
It was put to Messrs Fraser and
Marshall that the quality of Imperial
College residences is such that
students are not receiving value for
money. Mr. Fraser said that next

year, all rooms in hall would be
supplied with an inventory of
contents.
Angus Fraser, Managing
Director, and Gordon Marshall,
Director of Estates, gave the hall
residents the usual treatment. They
listened to the question being asked,
and then answered a totally different
one.
Accommodation has always been
a problem for the new Ash
appointed (Ashite) management
team. Angus Fraser was appointed
in November 1989, after 'a year
taking stock' whilst remaining on
the board of his old company,
Chloride. Gordon Marshall was
appointed as Director of Estates
eighteen months ago, though he was
visible around IC before that.
Marshall came to prominence
following the sacking of IC
Business Manager, Tom Stevens,
on 2 November, 1990. Stevens was
responsible for the purchase of
Clayponds, in South Ealing, and the
simultaneous selling of Montpelier
Hall, a postgraduate residence. The
plan was that in separate deals, the
College was to sell Montpelier for
at least £7 million and finance the
building of Clayponds, for £11
million. The Clayponds shell out
went ahead, and then Stevens was
sacked. No sooner had the axe
fallen, Montpelier was taken off the
market, so that the legal documents
could be scrutinised.
When the college read the
documents, they found that, under
the deeds, Montpelier could only be
used for educational purposes. This
wrecked the Sherfield financial
wheeze, and landed accommodation
with a £20.5 million debt.
Is this why IC is throwing
students out of their rooms over
Easter? There is no better way to
pay off the debt than to let rooms
over the vacation at conference
rates of between £18 and £25 a
night. If students complain, they are
told to go away and learn to read.
Area residences manager, Graham
Daniels, told iCNN that 'there isn't
a problem here. These people
(students) knew exactly what they
were signing up for'.
If only the Estates Division had
learned to read the deeds of
Montpelier Hall. They had more
time to do so than the average first
year coming to Imperial, moving
away from home for the first time,
and willing to take any
accommodation on any terms.
How much of the blame for the
Montpelier fiasco can be placed
with the Ashite management team?
Angus Fraser was in his job for a
full year. Gordon Marshall had
been recently appointed as Estates
Director. However, he was in the
