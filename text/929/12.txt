Romanian
Ex sometime visitor to the
department of Biotechnology and
now part time relief worker Martin
Heighway decided to forgo the
materialist crap that is the British
Christmas and freeze his nuts off in
North Romania for two months.
This is not his story...
On December 25th 1989, Nicolae
Ceaucescu, total dictator of
Romania, art collector, hunter.
An HIV-positive orphan
shooter, fisher and mass murderer
was taken from the house of justice
in Bucharest, lined up against a wall
with his wife Elena, and shot to
death.
This was a particularly ironic
death for the man who had liked
nothing more than tramping around
the woods in the Moldavian
hiterland, blasting innocent Bears,
Wolves and other assorted furry
creatures to death.
His wife was even more
loathsome. Widely tipped to take
over from her husband in the event
of his demise, and for the most part,
even more of an extremist than he
was, she had acquired a reputation
as an organic chemist of
international standing. Having
attended many symposia and being
awarded many honorary degrees
(including one from the Polytechnic
of Central London) it was
subsequently found that she was
scarcely literate and had not even
passed out of primary school.
The rest of the family all received
long prison sentences, the exception
being their son Nicu, who is of
interest here because he graduated
from Imperial College in 1971 with
a third in Physics. Possibly the only
honest member of the family, he
now has gainful employment as
boss of a hydro electric plant.
Following Christmas a situation
not unsimilar to the French reign of
terror was instigated. Large scale
social disorder saw gangs of miners
from the Romanian equivalent of
the N U M wandering the streets
proclaiming to be the Police of the
post revolutionary republic. The
reality was different. Hundreds
disappeared in reprisals and score
settling for 40 years of communist
repression, and it was not
uncommon to see people beaten to
death in the streets. Particularly
hated of course were the Securitate,
the plain clothes secret police,
instantly recognisable by their
yellow number plated cars, the big
brother that could beat and arrest
you for major economic crimes
such as possession of five American
dollars.
Romania had always been the
Maverick of the Eastern block
states. The only Soviet satellite
never to have foreign troops on its
soil, Romania had constantly been
at odds with its large neighbour.
Publically condemning the
invasions of Hungary and
Czechoslovakia, Ceaucescu had
gained a reputation as a skilled
diplomat by organising the Camp
David talks in 1976 between Begin
and Sadat. A state visit to Britain
followed, accompanied by the
Queen, who full of smiles in public,
in private made references to 'that
loathsome little man'.
Ceaucescu then chose to follow
his own particular brand of
communism. A staunch Stalinist,
upon assuming power he
immediately instigated a programme
Possession of
five American
dollars was a
major crime
of economic austerity. One of the
most bizarre measures of course,
was his policy on population.
Romania is not a large country. It
has a population of about 22
million, in an area greater than the
UK. It's economy has always been
heavily based on agriculture. In the
1970s Ceaucescu became obsessed
with paying off the national debt.
Agriculture was kicked up a gear
and massive export of produce and
goods was instigated. For a short
time Romania became the only

country in the world not to have a
foreign debt. Ironically, whilst
small surges of democracy were
occuring in other Eastern states (eg
the emergence of solidarity in
Poland), these states were not given
economic help by the west, whilst
on the say so of America, Romania
was accorded most favoured nation
status by the Western trade
alliances. A condition of this
wiping their backside with Moses
and Jesus.
The upgrade of agriculture was
concurrent with abolition of the
traditional farming system and
centralisation into 'agro-industrial
complexes'. Fifth generation
farmers suddenly found themselves
living in tower blocks, stripped of
their land. Of course, manpower
was needed to feed the agro-
Dr Adriana in the drugless pharmacy
agreement was that Romania take
and distribute 100,000 Bibles.
These were subsequently taken, and
recycled into toilet paper, which is
a precious commodity in Romania.
The recycling was inefficient, text
was still visible in the paper, and
Romanians used to joke about
industrial machine, and here we
come to the most distressing
episode of Romania's modern
history.
A complete ban on birth control
was instigated, accompanied with
abortion being made illegal. Tax
concessions and medals were
available to any woman who could
produce 5 children.
It was not uncommon in peasant
families for 10 or 12 children to be
born, and abortion was merely
driven into the backstreets. The
most amazing case I came across in
a local hospital was of a woman
who had had 5 abortions in one
year, she was lucky. Death from
septicaemia was common, as was
sterility. Almost complete absense
of antibiotics and anaesthetics
except for those stolen, smuggled
or imported did not help.
The result was obvious,
Thousands of births, massive
incidence of sexually transmitted
diseases and when the government
finally got around to admitting to it,
rocketting levels of HIV infection.
Life in Romania is sometimes hard,
brutish and short. Of course the
orphanages began to fill up, as did
homes for the mentally and
physically handicapped. Perhaps
more alarming were the institutions
for adults. From my experience in
these places it seems that
commitable offences included rape,
insanity, alcoholism, having
syphylis, not being married by the
time you were a woman of 32 and
not agreeing with the economic
policies of the government. More
frightening is the fact that these
people are still there. After the
revolution a large amount of paper
shredding took place including
many signed release notes. The
orphanages were of a similar type.
I asked some of the children Unde
este ta familia? (where are your
family), to which a standard answer
would be Nu Stiu (I don't know).
Those that did know did not have
much good news ('My mother had
a heart attack and a tree fell on my
father's head').
The government had been clever.
The orphanages and mental
institutions of Romania are split up
into possibly 800 sites dotted all
over the country. Tucked away in
the mountains, staffed entirely by
the population of one village, who
were anxious to keep their own
jobs, a veil of secrecy was drawn
over these places so that the vast
majority of other Romanians did not
know about them.
Staffed by the ignorant and the
untrained, these places became
breeding grounds for neglect and
misery.
Indeed it is thought that even
today there are some of these
institutions in remote locations
which have not yet been discovered
by western aid organisations.
After the first televison crews
made their forays into these places
a massive programme of fund
raising and relief work was
instigated. Indeed take a flight from
London to Bucharest today and the
likelihood is that half the poeple on
the flight will be going there for this
reason.
Of course the initial days were
not without problems. Large
amounts of aid were and still are
stolen. An associate of my views
this philosophically as part of the
problem when you 'send the hungry
to feed the starving'. I have to
agree, another friend of mine, who
was the first British nurse into
Romania after the revolution says
that perhaps we should not moralise
considering that every year £5
million worth of equipment is stolen
from the National Health Service.
Still it must have been disconcerting
to have your equipment stolen the
same night that you bring it, and
then be offered it for sale to you the
next day in the local market, as
happened to several groups.
My first trip to Romania was last
/ was reminded
of the Nazi
deathcamps
summer, with an expedition from
the University of London St Johns
ambulance group. The expedition
included another student from IC
and a large number from Mary's.
I can only speak for myself when
I say that what I found in certain
institutions sickened me. Of course,
never having been there it is
possibly unfair for me to make a
comparison but I was reminded of
the Nazi death camps. The asylum
at Costina—200 men and women,
of all ages. Forced to sleep two or
three to a bed, with no day care
facilities at all. The prospect of a
cold bath once every three to four
months (there was no running
water), and a change of clothes
possibly once every six. Complete
lack of sanitary protection for the
women (they were in the habit of
holding their hands over their
vaginas to stem the flow of
menstrual blood and then eating by
hand from a communal food bowl).
At first the dormitories were
mixed—sexual abuse, rape and
pregnancy were common. There
had also been several suspected
cases of murder. The toilets
consisted of buckets which we
slopped out frequently. Food
consisted of a slop of whatever was
available—rice, potatoes and pig
fat.
