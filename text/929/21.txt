the text is entirely my own. . • •
Consequences
When I wrote the article on the
pitfalls of doing a PhD, in Felix last
week, issue 928,1 never realised the
repercussions it would cause. The
misunderstanding has caused a great
deal of embarrassment and
aggravation both to myself and staff
in my department.
The article was sub-headed and
illustrated by the editor and could
have cost me my PhD project since
I had not appreciated the effect it
would have on readers who had
constructed what was intended to be
generalised comments as specific
criticisms of individuals. This was
genuinely not intended and I deeply
regret the bad feeling which has
resulted.
I spent two years trying to get
funding to come and work at
Imperial under my present
supervisors and turned down
several PhDs at other Universities
during that time. As a result of a
first eighteen months of hard work,
from myself and my supervisors,
my own PhD research is at a very
exciting and enviable stage and I am
perfectly happy with the facilities
and supervision in my department.
The comments in the FELIX
article were intended to be a
generalised summary of the types
of problems which are experienced
by research students and
supervisors attempting to get the
best out of a system which is
chronically underfunded. British
research is kept going in large part
by the goodwill of all concerned
staff and students. I am afraid the
article has done nothing to improve
this goodwill. I hope that if nothing
else it will serve to focus the
attention on the need for everyone
in the university research system to
stick together and pull in the same
direction for better support.
