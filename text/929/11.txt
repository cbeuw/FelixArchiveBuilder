6 March 1992 Felix 929 Feature
Trevor Speaks comprises Pete
Ward and Dan Johnston, from
Oxford Youth Works who
specialise in doing live gigs for
O Y W . They are coming to 'The
Arts Week' next Friday.
The Fat and Frantic concert
during 'The Arts Week' 1990
attracted a large crowd and was
very entertaining. Students had
been raving about their music but
their tapes didn't impress me at all.
However, seeing is believing, so it
is said, and I found them brilliant
'live'.
So when I was sent a tape of
'Trevor Speaks' and told that
they're a bit like the above but
better, I didn't expect to enjoy it.
A straight tape recording of a duo
without high-tech studio processing
didn't appeal to me. I was to be
pleasantly surprised.
'A Way of Life' is a good driving
first number with good contrasts
and the backing vocal mixed to feel
This Saturday Imperial College
Science Fiction society (ICSF) are
holding a Science Fiction
convention. 'What's a Science
Fiction convention?' you cry. I can
tell you because I have been to the
last two PicoCons and other cons
around the country. Essentially a
convention is a get together of like
minded people. In this case we are
the people who saw Terminator 2,
Star Trek 6, and Red Dwarf, and
read Terry Pratchett and Clarke and
Asimov. We are also the people
who want to visit space, build
hyper-intelligent machines, or battle
with the level ten mage after
swallowing a bubbling purple
potion. Alternatively we take pint
in one hand, book in the other, and
seek out authors to sign the
aforementioned book, or offer the
pint.
A usual feature of SF Cons (as
they are called) is the Guest of
Honour. Usually an author or artist,
the guest of honour is persuaded to
part with valuable inside knowledge
in the form of a 'talk'. Since aeons
ago this talk has been bribed out of
guests of honour by lubrication with
amber nectar. Two such guests who
spring to mind are Brian Stableford
and Dave Langford. Brian
Stableford is a British author of
some repute. His long career in
novel writing is continuing with the
recent publication of 'Empire of
Fear' (a book about the bloody
exploits of vampires) and the
'Werewolves of London' trilogy.
He is also known for literary
criticism in magazines such as
Interzone and Million.
slightly distant, an effect I liked,
though with too much reverb for
me. The lyrics seemed to change
direction after the first verse, but
picked up on unemployment, and
feminism. I guess they wanna
change the world.
Tn my Blood' shuffled along
highlighting our unpredictable
emotional responses to life. The
rhythm haunted me - memories of
'America'?
'When I Meets I' is a good one.
I seem to remember Pete Ward
recording this before he met up with
Danny, and being in a band that
played it. Whatever the treatment,
there is something about the verse
which always grabs me, though I
didn't like the strumming on this
one.
'Warm Love' is about what it
says, though I didn't catch some of
the lyrics. There is a humorous
replacement for them in the words
sheet. A complete change follows
David Langford is also renowned
for criticism, but of a less serious
kind. Dave is on the other side of
the reader fence. He has won
several Hugos as a fan writer (a
Hugo is the science fiction
equivalent of an Oscar), more than
anyone else in the world, as I am
led to believe. 'They will both be
giving talks at PicoCon this
Saturday, in the Union Building,
Beit.
Before I forget, PicoCon will cost
four pounds to ICSF members, five
to everybody else, which isn't much
considering it goes on from 11 in
the morning to 7 in the evening.
Apart from the guest authors,
there will be an SF trivia quiz. Of
course this quiz covers every aspect
of real and unreal life, such as
films, fantasy, Dr Who, Blake's 7,
Star Trek and so on. (Whose
birthday was on the 12th of January
in 1992?). You can take part by just
turning up, and finding a team to
join. Hopefully, we will have a
panel discussion on 'Self Criticism
in SF and Fantasy', taking things
like HitchHiker's Guide to the
Galaxy and the work of Kurt
Vonnegut as a starting point.
And that is about it. If you think
you might enjoy an SF convention
then come along. I guarantee you
will. And if you can't make it this
time round there is the National SF
Convention this Easter.
Illumination will be much bigger
than our humble little effort and is
partly organised by e x - I C S F

(Oh. and it was Hal's birthday.)
in the form of 'Squeaky Clean', a
rip of narrow minded religious
people. It sounds like a lot of fun
so I look forward to hearing this one
'live' even though I'll miss the FX.
'Oxford Town' is where Trevor
Speaks hails from. It poignantly
plays the nostalgia and reality
extremes of this world famous city.
'It's the pits..' is still ringing in my
ears. This is obviously where
they're at home, and presumably
expresses deep feelings for some of
their local audiences. This is
perhaps Trevor Speaks at their best.
Penultimately. 'Old Fashioned
Music' drives incessantly.
Impossible to listen to without the
rhythm trying to escape from your
bones. Here, here, to the old
fashioned music in my soul. As for
the last track. Maybe you'll make
more of it than I could.
Needless to say, I'll be first in the
queue for Trevor Speaks at
lunchtime Friday 13th. With
burgers in Beit Quad and two other
acts in the Union Lounge as well
(Ben Okafor plus Steve Turner,
Poet in Residence), it promises to
be one of the best events in 'The
Arts Week'.
