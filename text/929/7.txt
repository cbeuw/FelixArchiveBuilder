employ of the college before that -
he was a consultant working with
the Estates division that drew up the
sale plans.
The situation has not improved

Tizard Committees meet with

concession on Easter rents.
The most recent altercation has
been on the 'Easter business rates'
proposal. The Conference and
Accomodation Office sent letters to
all students with 34 week leases
informing them that they faced
eviction at the start of the Easter
vacation. Prince's Gardens students
who wished to remain in their
rooms over the holidays were
subsequently informed that they
would either be billed at £18 a
night, or would be moved to other
college accomodation.
The fury provoked by this
arrogant missive resulted in a letter
from the Overseas Students
Committee, again to Gordon
Marshall. Making the point that
overseas students would be
especially inconvenienced by
evictions, they rapidly switched
from persuasion to threat.
We have never in the past been
reluctant to recommend Imperial to
fellow students from our home
countries... however, if students are
not allowed to stay in their rooms
over the Easter vacation, at the
same levels of rent that they
currently pay, we will have to write
to all Universities and funding
bodies in our countries, to highlight
this lack of consideration.
The 'Easter business rates' plans
came on top of the continuing battle
in Linstead over the food pricing
system. During the 1991 summer
vacation, in the absence of students,
it was decided that Linstead Hall
students would be charged for five
evening meals a week, regardless
of whether they were there or not.
This contrasted with the
arrangement in previous years
whereby students could sign out for
up to two meals a week.
The advantage of the previous
arrangement was that it allowed
students the flexibility to pursue
their involvement with clubs and
societies. Liz Holmes, Linstead
Hall convenor, described the new
regulations as 'unreasonable and
unfair', and said that 'a few students
are already considering moving
out'. She also pointed out that the
new scheme resulted in the wastage
of at least 2,000 meals in the first
term alone.
Initial suggestions from Gordon
Marshall were rejected by Linstead
residents. After much discussion, a
modification of the old rebate
system was introduced. Though an
improvement, students at Linstead
are far from completely satisfied.
They join students at Southwell,
which has a list of defects as long
as your arm. Southside students
complain about freezing cold
rooms. The good news is that the
cockroaches in Southside don't
seem to mind the cold, though they
are concerned about the lack of
kitchen facilities.
Lack of heat is also a problem in
Selkirk and Tizard Halls. Olave
Hall has no hot water. Montpelier
still has its postgraduates, but no
heating or maintenance.
Clayponds, South Ealing, is the
newest hall, and it has the most
appropriate name. Why bathe when
you can swim? The condensation
problem has been solved by Gordon
Marshall suggesting that residents
leave their windows open. The one
snag is that this invalidates the
insurance. Illiteracy, Gordon?
The shower doors in Clayponds
leak, but this is not confined to
Ealing. The Evelyn Gardens
showers are also useless when you
need them, and hyper- efficient
when you don't. The ceilings find
the law of gravity amusing; they
keep'falling down in mirth. One
wonders when the laughter of
falling masonry will be followed by
the screams of a trapped student.
The minor problems can be
solved by students reporting defects
as and when they occur. The
procedure is to report defects to the
housekeeper, who will then report
to the residences managers. If there
is no action after three weeks,
students are entitled to check the
'defects' book in 15 Prince's
Gardens, and then report to area
residences manager Graham
Daniels (phone 3553 or
071-589-4051).
Students should also notify IC
Union of any problems, through
Nicky Fox, Housing Officer, or
Jonathan Griffiths, Union Deputy
President. The Union is pursuing
accommodation problems at high
levels in the college, and it is
essential for them to have accurate
information.
If you wish to do this yourself,
you can contact Gordon Marshall
on 3402, Angus Fraser on 3003 or
6016, or Sir Eric Ash, IC Rector,
on 3000. Angus Fraser can also be
contacted outside of hours on 071.
589 9779. Again, please notify the
Union of any correspondence.
It is also a good idea to let your
department know of any
accommodation difficulties. The
best person to contact is your
personal tutor, senior tutor, or head
of department. Alternatively, IC
college tutors are David Goodgame
on 4549 or Julia Higgins on 8308.
Academic departments have
become especially concerned about
the IC accommodation crisis. They
are now beginning to view it as a
serious threat to IC's academic
reputation, as well as a serious
social problem. Academics and IC
Union have acted jointly in the past
to solve individual difficulties. With
the I C U sabbatical elections
currently running, it may be time
to consider renewed action by the
Union, and to demand firm
suggestions from sabbatical
candidates on how they would deal
with the problem.
It is also time to look afresh at the
workings of the Estates division,
and at the manoeuvrings of the
Accommodation and Conference
Office. Time to consider their
agenda. Time to work out if they
are interested in housing students,
or running a business. Time to
evaluate their competence and
overall suitability for the jobs they
hold.
