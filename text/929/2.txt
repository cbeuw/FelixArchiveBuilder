Letters Felix 929 6 March 1992
We revolve with it
Dear Adam,
On Friday, the 28th of Feb 1992
the Overseas Student Committee
(OSC) celebrated the success of its
International Night '92. A true
celebration of the cultural arts, the
evening kicked off with a food fair
in the main dining hall followed by
a presentation of traditional and
cultural items and dances, only to
close to the beat of a live African
band in the main dining hall. A
disco was also in full swing in the
junior common room for those who
really wanted to 'get down' to it!
The food was excellent, the show
was great, the crowd was
supportive and no- one would
D A R E to say that they didn't have
a good time. Only problem was
that, taking a sweeping glance at the
crowd, one could tell (using very
little intelligence) that some sort of
Overseas, or more Asian to that
effect, 'thing' was going on.
The OSC did an extremely good
job in publicity and so on and I
recall the event was a sell-out. But
sadly, however, I noticed that the
crowd lacked in our European and
even more so British friends.
Ignorance can only mean colour
blindness or illiteracy, as bright
posters, in English, were posted all
over the college weeks before the
event. As for the tickets being sold
out, I can only resort to '... if there's
a will, there's always a way.' I
don't mean gate crash or anything
to that effect but if people were
really interested, they would have
made the effort to have enquired
and obtained tickets much earlier.
I can only point out blatantly that
we have an attitude problem on our
hands. It's not an Overseas Nite for
overseas people only, it's for others
to get to know the various cultures
and traditions from all over the
world. It's about understanding and
getting to know people,
appreciating their backgrounds and
their values, and most important of
all, having a good time.
If you're worried about getting
bored out of your skull because you
can't understand a thing that's going
on, don't be! Take the trouble, ask
people around you , I'm sure they'd
be more than happy to explain
what's going n.
I sincerely feel sorry for those of
you who missed out on this
excellent event. Union events are on
year round and the bars are open
every night (besides there was a bar
open there too!!) but an opportunity
to see the cultures of the world
together in one place does not come
by often.
I would just like people to sit back

We're so lucky
Dear Adam,
It's that time of year again, isn't it?
Sabbatical elections. Don't you just
love 'em? We're so lucky this year
to be blessed with such an
overwhelming array of top-notch
candidates jockeying for those
celestial positions. In the past they
have tended to fall into one of the
following categories:-
a) the joke candidate
b) the candidate who has promised
to address the current student issues
and has appeased the minority
groups traditionally targeted in the
manifestos as post-graduates or St.
Mary's (this year by far the largest
category).
c) the ex-CCU 'heavy-weight' who
has honed their leadership and
organizational skills beyond belief
and who feels OBLIGED to serve
the students until death do they part
- commonly known as the
'has-been'.
d) the Union hack who has made
every attempt to crawl up the arses
of the 'influentials' since coming to
college and has in the process
completely ballsed-up their degree.
e) those who felt that they could
make a positive contribution to
student life and actually did. This
group is exceedingly small and is
in great danger of becoming extinct.
This year though the candidates
together form a totally new
category:-
f) shite.
Categories (a), (b), (c) and (d)
really get on everyone's tits but they
tend to be victorious over category
(e) due to lack of representation. So
what can Y O U do to ensure the
continued effectiveness of the
Union? Bugger all really. There are
about a dozen professional full-time
staff who currently coordinate a
large proportion of the Union's
activities in the financial,
organizational and social areas.
a moment and think about how
much they know about the people
and the cultures around them. We
see them in the corridors, at lectures
and even in the street, but how
much do we actually know about
them and their way of life. What is
symbolic to them and what's not.
I'm not saying that I know a lot, but
I sure feel proud to know that I
tried.
Remember, the world does not
revolve around us, we revolve with
it!

Degrade
Dear Adam,
The RCS Annual Dinner on
Saturday was a great success- the
food, band, booze and especially
Terry Pratchett's speech were
second to none. Unfortunately a
decision of certain male students to
act completely thoughtlessly meant
a strip-o-gram was ordered to
appear just before the speeches. I
don't care how funny the financiers
found it, I didn't. As a female I felt
degraded and incensed at their total
lack of respect for any women
present. I wonder why they
bothered to dress so well, when
they intended to stoop so low and
spoil such an evening. Is there any
wonder there are so few females
attending I.C., when this is attitude
that would greet them when they
arrive?

Along with help from groups such
as the Ents crew and Felix, and the
multitudes of committees, the
Union runs smoothly without
sabbaticals. So why do we have
them at all? Unfortunately I'd not
have the answer to this, but may I
suggest that you vote N E W
ELECTION this time, if only to see
whether it causes the drastic drop
in services prophesied by the merry
band of wasters who have great
difficulty in believing that life does
indeed exist outside the confines of
the Union.
Yours with a decent job offer and
degree prospects,
Christopher Adams,
