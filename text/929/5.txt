6 March 1992 Felix 929 Felix
Sabbatical Elections are just
around the corner, Monday and
Tuesday of next week, so here is the
all-new Felix guide to how to vote,
and what it all means.
STV - Single Transferable Vote
At Imperial College, we operate a
system called the Single
Transferable Vote. A candidate
needs more than 50% of the vote to
win. If no candidate achieves this
on first preferences, then the
candidate with the fewest votes is
eliminated and their votes
distributed amongst the remaining
candidates according to the second
preferences expressed on those
papers. This redistribution
continues until someone achieves
greater than 50% of the total vote
whereupon they are declared the
winner.
Just to confuse matters a little,
each post also has the candidate
New Election. If this 'candidate'
wins the election then a new
election is called, and the whole
election process starts again.
You can make your vote more
effective by expressing all your
preferences. If your first choice has
too few votes, or even more than
the quota (when there is more than
one vacancy), then your vote can be
used to help elect another candidate.
Please note that putting second,
third, etc, choices on your ballot
paper will not affect the chances of
your first choice (think about it and
you'll see how this is true).
Important points to remember
Treat each election separately,
using '1', '2', '3', etc in each case.
Only use numbers. Any other
marks can invalidate your vote.
Make sure you start at 1, and only
use each number once. It is a good
idea to put as many preferences as
you can to get the most effective use
of your vote.
Remember that your vote will
only go to your second choice when
your First choice is either already
elected, or eliminated. Putting a
towards your second (and the rest)
preferences.
Voting is taking place on Monday
9th, and Tuesday 10th March:
that's the first two days next week.
Ballot boxes will be present at St
Mary's, all South Kensington
departments, and Silwood Park,
from 10am to 5pm on each day.
An Example Election
Here is an example with, of
course, totally fictitious candidates.
You are given a ballot paper for the
How and Where to Vote
second, third, etc, choice in no way
affects the chances of your first
choice.
If there are any points about the
voting system which you still don't
understand then please contact the
Returning Officer, Steve Farrant, in
the Union Office.
How and Where to vote
In order to vote you must have
your Union Membership Card. You
can then go to a ballot box, get your
voting paper, and vote away.
Remember that you must not cross
your paper, you must number your
choices in order of preference,
placing a T by your first choice
and continuing this numerical order
until you have no further
preference. If your first choice is
eliminated, your vote will still count

When the votes are counted up, they

preferences:
Bill

No-one has reached the quota of
601, so Bill is eliminated and his
second preferences are
redistributed. Of those 230 votes,
175 go to Weed, 25 to New
Election, 15 to Ben, and 15 have no
second preference. Giving

Bye-bye Ben, and on we go again.
The quota becomes 593 due to non-
transferable votes (half of 1185,
plus 1). Ben's votes are
redistributed according to the next
preference (those with 1st
preference for Ben are assigned
according to the second preference,
those with 2nd preference for Ben
are assigned by the third
preferences). If those preferences
have Bill, then they are assigned
according to their next preference.
Of those 285, 200 go to Weed, 35
to New Election, and 50 have no
further preferences.
