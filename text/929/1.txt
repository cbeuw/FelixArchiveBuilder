Elections Drop Soc
A number of Imperial Students hung from a tree in Hyde Park last
Wednesday to raise money for an expedition to the Pamir Mountains
in the former Soviet Union. One of the students said that the purpose
of the expedition was to 'do some climbing' and explore one of the
last wildernesses in the world. The expedition is hoping to raise
Â£13,400 to fund itself.
Imperial College Union sabbatical
election candidates received a
difficult reception from St Mary's
students, and the relevance of ICU
election rules are in question
following Monday's hustings. The
candidates fielded questions from a
cynical audience which believed
that the candidates' interest in St
Mary's affairs was due simply to
the election. ICU President, Zoe'
Hellinger, has called for a review
of the election regulations following
clashes between students and the
electoral Returning Officer.
The anger of St Mary's students
at the alleged lack of interest from
IC was focused by a non-directed
written question submitted to all
presidential candidates. The
question asked why none of the
candidates felt it necessary to talk
to Mary's students. It then further
reminded the candidates of Ben
Turner, a previous candidate who
was defeated at the first ballot after
remarking that St Mary's was
unimportant.
Candidates were ridiculed when
they claimed that they had an active
interest in the affairs of St Mary's.
Howard Jones, a Presidential
candidate, was cross examined
from the floor after replying that not
only did he think it was important
to consult with St Mary's, but he
had also done so. Toby Jones, a
Felix candidate; was later
'flangoed' by St Mary's Rag.
Angelo Gardini, running for
President, replied that 'of course
Mary's matters', at which point a
member of the crowd called out,
'only when you want our votes'.
When Mr Gardini suggested that St
Mary's students should come to the
IC Union office when they had
problems, he was asked why he
could not come to the St Mary's
Union office.
Chris Davidson, running for
President, said that any answer to
the question would be seen as
electioneering, but that if anyone
wanted to talk to him, they could
do so after the Karaoke evening in
St Mary's union building.
The candidates were also
questioned on their knowledge of St
Mary's affairs. Topics which came
up repeatedly were Wilson House
and the original St Mary's merger
document, which was described by
Mr Gardini as 'irrelevant'. Cries of
'vote new election' were clearly
audible after M r Gardini's
questioning.
Problems with the restrictive
nature of electoral coverage rules
came angrily to the fore at the end
of Howard Jones' directed
questions. The established format of
two minute speeches followed by
written questions was repeatedly
challenged from the floor during the
course of the evening. Students
criticised the limited number of
written questions, which were
vetted by the elections committee,
and claimed the entire proceedings
were undemocratic.
Turbulent scenes developed as
students argued with the election
Returning Officer, Steve Farrant.
At one stage. Mr Farrant was
referred to as a 'bureaucratic
bastard'. Simon Stockhill, President
of St Mary's Students' Union,
removed the microphone from M r
Farrant to carry out a head count of
those in favour of open questions
from the floor. Mr Farrant later
handed control of the meeting over
to M r Stockhill.
The dissension began when Mr
Farrant objected to a move to open
the hustings to the floor. To cries
of 'why, why?', he pointed out that
such a move was 'against election
rules'. This interpretation was
.Challenged by Ms Hellinger, who
said that 'after two minutes per
candidate, they (students) can ask
(the candidates) any questions they
like'. Ms. Hellinger then warned
'Steve, seriously, we're just causing
annoyance', and was later heard to
remark that it was time to review
the election regulations.
Howard Jones told the students to
vote for him or New Election. 'It's
your only hope,' he said. In
response to a written question,
Angelo Gardini said that 'gay and
lesbians ... have a damn hard time',
and added that if anyone wanted to
set up a gay and lesbian society, he
would 'try and smooth the way for
them'. Chris Davidson said that he
was 'not doing it for the
money.. .not doing it for the power'.
St Mary's students also raised
objections to plans from some
deputy president candidates to cut
the price of beer. The Deputy
President can only request that bar
prices be cut. They do not have the
authority to enforce a price cut. St
Mary's reminded candidates that
they have a separate licence to that
of Imperial College Union, and so
the Deputy President has no
authority in this field whatsoever.
St Mary's students also defended
their right to determine their own
Entertainments programme.
Felix editor candidates were
heavily slated for the newspaper's
lack of interest in St Mary's affairs.
The candidates were asked when
Felix last published 'something
positive'. The current Felix editor,
Adam Harrington, later refused to
comment on the criticisms raised by
the St Mary's students. (iCNN)
