Clubs & Societies Felix 929 6 March 1992
Finance Business and Investment
On 27th February, Ernst and
Young, a leading firm of Chartered
Accountants, invited societies from
Imperial, LSE, Kings and U C L to
participate in their 'Tycoon'
business game. Naturally, the
Imperial College Business and
Investment Society (FBI Soc)
dominated the event, not only by
providing the largest teams, but by
winning the competition! But before
we gloat, we'll explain what the
business game involved.
Each team of 6 students had to
bid for 20 properties in and around
central London, ranging from
May fair to the Isle of Dogs. They
then had to decide what they were
going to build on their acquired
properties e.g. an office block or a
hotel. Next, they had to persuade
a Planning Permission Officer that
he was born to approve their
designs. However this was a bit
harder than it may sound
considering the officer was drunk
out of his skull! Once this near-
impossible feat was achieved, each
team had to bid for construction
materials after which they had to
construct their buildings. Next, they
had to negotiate with the Estate
Agents to attract clients to rent their
properties. And to add to all this,
all teams had to constantly beg for
loans from (as usual) a rather
unsympathetic Bank Manager! At
the end of the game, the team which
made the most profit (by having the
most valuable buildings and the
lowest debts) won. The game did
not require previous financial
knowledge and experience, just
skills used every day e.g. bribery
and schizophrenia.
The first FBI team, FBI1, began
well, acquiring two properties at
low prices (even though at one point
their members bid against each
other!). However after that, they
followed the 'BCCI Handbook of
management'...
The second FBI team, FBI2, also
began well, but faltered at the
construction stage, where, due to a
shortage of materials, they were
forced to build a 20-storey office
block completely out of glass and
with no roof!
The third FBI the very drunk
Planning Permission officer
£2million to light his cigarette!) and
delicate 'interpersonal' negotiations
with the Bank manager, they
succeeded in making the largest
profit and, as a result, won the
competition.
Since the competition, FBI1 have
become administration of the
Mirror Group Pension Fund, FBI2
have accepted the offer to construct
the Channel Tunnel, and the very
two properties FBI3 acquired have
been bombed...
Final result 1) FBI3 2) Kings 3)
LSE 4) IndSoc (Imperial) 5) FBI2
6) LSE 6) IndSoc 7) U C L 8) FBI1
9) Kings 10) L S E

Sailing Away
This year has been monumental for
the IC sailing team, we have
actually been winning some races!
Our crowning acheivment was
last weekend, with the first team
travelling down to Exeter
University. We were sailing in the
Exeter Excalibur competition,
sailed in Lark dinghies, and were
rewarded with a well earned second
place. On Friday, everything
seemed to go wrong on the
transport front, but we eventually
made it down, albeit rather
squashed. On Saturday, we had
some fun getting used to the tide,
but easily won our first three league
races against Reading, Bristol and
Exeter. On Sunday, we faced our
two most challenging opponents.
We lost to Plymouth Poly after a
disastrous start, including a broken
tiller. Qualifying for the semi-finals
depended on our last race, against
the Starcross team, consisting of ex-
national champions and university
team racers. After another terrible
start, we pulled ourselves together,
kept cool, and capitalised on our
opponents' mistakes. With some
fine team racing, we fought our way
into a winning position, which we
held until the finish.
Having qualified for the semis,
we faced Oxford II, winners of the
other league. They had won all their
races, but we trounced them
nonetheless. So in the final, we
faced Plymouth again, and despite
a valiant effort in the second race,
could not recoer from a bad first
outing, and so claimed second
place, and some rather nice prizes!
The other big event this term has
been the London 'Dick', with 24
teams competing on our home
venue, the Welsh Harp Reservoir
near Hendon. In a tough league, we
won all but two of our races, but
the quarter finals were abandoned,
so we didn't go through. The
second team, consisting of helms
Liam Moloney, Ben Hancock and
Ben Daverson, plus various crews
put up a spirited performances, and
were unlucky not to beat London II
and Oxford II.
Last term was also successful, we
started the year with new boats and
a lot of'enthusiastic team racers. As
the term wore on the days become
colder, some couldn't cope but a
hard core of dedicated sailors
remained. The main event was the
London 6 Pack again sailed at our
home venue, the Welsh Harp. The
first team stormed throught the
leagues, beating teams from
London, Brunei, Southampton
Institute, and Southampton, and
sailed a fine race to beat Bristol in
the quarter finals. However in the
semi's we come up against the
mighty Southamption firsts, and
exited from the competition losing
two straight races.
Last term's other important event
was the Student National
Championships, hosted by
Plymouth Poly. Winds varied from
nothing to quite alot, and after two
days racing, Angus and Mike ended
up 27th, with Liam and Ben D 37th
from 84 boats. A special mention
should also go to Robin and Ben H ,
both at IC but sailing for London,
coming 13th overall.
All in all, IC's teams are in better
shape than ever, we have only lost
to one university team all year, and
have high hopes for the University
Team Championships, hosted by
London in April.
