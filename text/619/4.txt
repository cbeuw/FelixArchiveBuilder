Captains
of
Industry?
by Nick Pyne
Following the Finniston Report four years ago
Imperial College started on an ambitious plan
to introduce four year courses, combining
many of the good points of a three year BSc
with an M S c in management to follow, and
with a greater leaning towards the needs of
manufacturing industry. In J u n e the first
graduates in chemical engineering left College.
This is a personal appraisal of the successes
and failures of the course, written from the
point of view of a c h e m i c a l e n g i n e e r . I
apologise for any generalisations or inac-
curacies.
C o m m i t m e n t
The commitment of departments to these
courses has always been somewhat suspect. A
sizeable minority of academics were against
the idea from the start (even if not vocally so),
and there seems to have arisen a conflict of
interest fairly early on. Some academics saw
the 4 Y C as a chance to cram more technical
knowledge in to the poor students. Whilst this
was one aim, it was not to be a major part;
most of the extra time was intended to be
t a k e n up with m a n a g e m e n t a n d D S E S
courses. However, the departments seem to
have c o n s i d e r e d these to be definitely
subsidiary subjects (a glance at the subject
examination weightings will confirm this),
something to be done in "spare time" and have
thus set workloads accordingly. The D M S and
D S E S , faced with this, attempt to set courses
with sufficient work to give a good under-
standing, but find that students who are short
of time simply ignored them. The low turn out
at lectures and tutorials reflects not only the
attitude of the students, but that of the
departments.
The commitment of the students must also
be questioned. At the point of leaving school
the choice of course is somewhat arbitrary,
and four years does not seem as daunting as it
might. Yet four years of all study and no play
(what most people find necessary to stay on
top of work) is more than most students can
face. The result? A high drop out rate leaving
only the more academically inclined and able
to complete the course. Those who chose to
stick it out against the odds are likely to come
out disillusioned and with a poor class of
degree.
Industry
Let us look, then, at the main aim of the
exercise. Are graduates really going to be
of more help to industry? H e r e chemical
engineering differs from the other departments
in that it does not run a purely sandwich
course. For C h e m Eng the periods of the
s u m m e r spent in industry seem to serve
mainly to point out how little of the theory
derived at College we are ever likely to use and
to erode our motivation even further.
Industry, too, is beginning to question the
validity of the course. Amongst this year's
graduates it seemed that a BEng was no
significant advantage, and the decreasing >
number of firms prepared to sponsor students
for the course suggests that no-one is fooled
by the reality behind the aim.
One of the major criticisms in the Finniston
Report was that courses were designed to turn
out academics, and that courses should be
designed with much more practical application.
Yet the promise that "there is nothing in the .
three year course that isn't in the four year
course" clearly indicates that there has been
little attempt to modify the core material, and
that the extra courses are simply a cosmetic
icing to give the show of greater applicability.
The future of four year courses is somewhat
in doubt. It is already rumoured that one
department is to drop the four year course
althogether, and chemical engineering is
introducing a different 4 Y C which will just be a
super-academic all-technical wonder (one asks
if this is really what they wanted all along?).
Could it be that soon 4 Y C graduates will be of
less use to industry rather than more?
Yet surely there must be some good to
these courses? Indeed there is. The depart-
ments have been able to use the 4 Y C to
maintain their prestigious positions with 1
respect to other institutions in the country,
and a considerable amount of extra investment
has been forthcoming. For the students? Well,
there's the different letters after your name,
and another year at the state's expense....But
then who cares about us anyway?
