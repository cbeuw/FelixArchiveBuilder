Puck (Christopher Biggins) and Hermia (Janet Spencer-Turner) in A Midsummer Night's Dream.
The play is essentially about.human love in its
various forms, but especially in that sudden,
almost unreal, love that results in mutual
fascination and infatuation from the very first
glance.
The Open Air Theatre is of course a superb
place to stage this play, what with its trees and
flowery b a n k s , winding paths, grotto and
tunnel. Well-placed loudspeakers among the
trees and in an old tree stump on the grassy
stage are used to good effect to recreate the
superbly fleeting and ethereal substance of
fairies (whizzing sounds are generated that
seem to the ear to fly over the audience). A n
imaginative use of light after the sun has set
adds to the d r e a m q u a l i t y of the p l a y ,
producing in the viewer confusion as to what is
real and unreal, what is a dream and what isn't.
The element of visual humour in the play is
strong, and whilst this delighted children in the
audience, it did perhaps upset the balance of
the play, especially towards the end. Dialogue
from the loudspeakers was often unclear.
The Shaw doublebill, A Midsummer Night's
Dream a n d The Taming of the Shrew
(reviewed in F E L I X 618) are in repertoire until
the end of the season on 28 August.

WALKABOUT-
LOOKSee

Descended from both Tamburlaine the Great
and Genghis K h a n , the ' G r a n d .Mughals'
conjure up visions of fairy-tale wealth and
splendour. The greatest of these Muslim
emperors ruled India, father and son, for
nearly two centuries. They were soldiers,
scholars, and patrons of the arts. Under
Akbar, a contemporary of Elizabeth I, their
empire covered the whole of Northern India
and part of the Deccan. They created an
administrative system which stabilized India,
made it a major world power of its day and
was capable of projecting, even in its eventual
dissolution, an ideal of unity: administrative
devices developed by the Mughals retained
their influence, and were taken over by the
British.
-hold on, just a minute what's a
paragraph like the one above doing in FELIX?
A n d , maybe more to the point, what is
" w a l k a b o u t - l o o k s e e " ? Perhaps a w o r d of
explanation is in order, before we proceed. If
my feet can be relied on to perform their
alloted task, and the editor is kind enough to
put up with my highly erratic puntuation, I
hope that a London walkabout column will
become a regular feature of F E L I X this year.
The articles will be written after visiting a
current exhibition or seeing an interesting
part of a museum's permanent collection (say
the E g y p t i a n m u m m i e s at the B r i t i s h
Museum); and so, some will be' about the
slightly touristy things one never quite seems
to get round to, when one's actually living in
L o n d o n ; a n d s o m e will be a bit m o r e
s p e c i a l i s t — t h a t m e a n s t h e r e ' l l be an
admission charge (!) but with a discount for
flashing a student's card. I hope that the
articles will be entertaining to read and that
you, like me, will find walkabout-looksee an
enjoyable alternative to the umpteenth lab
report or problem sheet.
to r e s u m e : T h e ' I n d i a n H e r i t a g e '
exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum
sets out to r e c a p t u r e the s p e c t a c u l a r
opulence of the sixteenth and seventeenth
century courts of the 'Grand Mughal', as he
was known throughout Europe. As well as
being a survey of the decorative and fine arts
of India before the Raj, the exhibition looks at
the lifestyle of the emperors themselves and
of the Maharajas of Hindu India, and the
Nawabs, lesser rulers who rose to power as
the Mughal Empire declined, in the eighteenth
century.
The design of the opening section gives the
impression of walking through a building in
Akbar's Royal City of Fatehpur Sikri; you
look out through 'windows' whose openwork
sandstone screens are carved in ingenious
geometric patters, each one different. A series
of watercolours shows how, during the two
centuries of Mughal rule, Hindu and Muslim
architectural styles fused and developed

together; from Akbar's sandstone palaces
with their traditionally Indian beams and
brackets, to the monuments of his grandson,
Shah Jahan (the builder of the Taj Mahal),
glittering white marble, bejewelled with
decorative inlay, and the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c
outlines of domes and arches.
The exhibition is extremely well laid out and
each part suggests a different atmosphere as
well as displaying a collection of beautiful
objects. The ceremony of the magnificent
daily Durbar—when the emperor sat out 'to
see and to be seen'—is illustrated with the
'Golden Throne of Rangit Singh' set on a
splendid carpet, surrounded by bright tent
hangings, a peacock feather fan, ceremonial
fly wisk (!) and gilded spears and standards.
When the imagination fails, details can be
found in the exquisite miniatures painted by
court artists. There's a charming one of a lady
in the imperial 'zenana' (harem) playing with a
yoyo!
Great luxury must have been taken for
granted at c o u r t , but the o v e r w h e l m i n g
impression of this exhibition is not so much of
self-indulgence, as of delight for being sur-
rounded by beautiful things. A love of fresh,
bright colours and of nature obviously went
hand-in-hand with high standards of craftman-
ship. Intricate floral designs are to be found
everywhere: on cotton floorspreads a n d
Kashmir shawls, in the semi-precious inlay of
m a r b l e p a n e l s , in the p a i n t e d e n a m e l
decoration of a flintlock gun, even on the
barrel of a small bronze cannon. Akbar's
biographer described the interiors of the
imperial.pavilions as 'beautiful flower beds'; if
the objects on display on anything to go by, I
can well believe him!
The exhibition continues until 15 August,
admission 50p for students (otherwise £1.50).
The V & A is open on weekdays from 10:00 till
17:30, Sundays 14:30 till 17:30, and closed
every Friday.
