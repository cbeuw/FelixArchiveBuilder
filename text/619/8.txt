Hello, Good Evening and Welcome
to F E L I X 619, the first I have produced. This is
the first of two postgrad issues this summer;
the second will follow on 21 August. After that,
the F r e s h e r s ' issue will be published on
Monday 4 October and then F E L I X will appear
every Friday as usual.
What's New?
I feel it's very easy to make change for
change's sake when editing a newspaper—and
since it's about the only thing that is very easy,
that's what I'm going to do! Already the more
observant of you will have noticed that the
news pages are in a different typeface, Times,
which is both clearer and easier to print than
Baskerville which we used before.

Thexton has been designing a new masthead
(the bit at the top of the front page) and this
will head the next issue. But so as not to keep
you.in suspense, a black and white version is
reproduced on this page.

The mascot is now returned and the Union are
still clueless as to who 'borrowed' it. May I use
this column to offer him (her?) my congratu-
lations. I have found the whole escapade very
funny, and I wish others had the wit to
highlight the Union's failings in such amusing
ways.

Golly! I hope all the soapboxes this year are as
hard-hitting and controversial as Nick Pyne's.
And I'm sure lots of people will want to take
issue with Nick's views—copy deadline for the
next FELIX is Friday 13 August.
Impossible without
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick, Peter, Peter, Steve,
Steve, Mark, Dave, Pallab (for trying), Chris,
Linda, Maz, all the people who took me at my
word and actually got round to telling me the
interesting things w h i c h were happening
around College, Izy and the collators, and the
folding machine which has promised to behave
itself tonight, since this is my first issue.

On the departure of the Lower Lounge
and Nick Morton
So, farewell then
Union
Lower Lounge Partition
Demolished
While still
In your prime
Y o u were
Big and
Thick
And wooden and
Lasted barely a year
Just like Nick

Richard, Steve and Tim are three mathe-
maticians of whom you will hear a great deal
more in the future. One is a pure mathe-
matician, one a statistician and the third an
applied mathematician. I'm sure you know the
situation by now—the pure mathematician
tells only the strict, rigorous truth, the
statistician tells alternately lies and the truth
and the applied mathematician always lies.
I was sitting in the Maths C o m m o n Room
the other day the three of them came in. Len
had recently retired from the lecturing staff,
and a dispute arose as to how long Len,
Michael, Norman, Oliver and Peter had been
on the staff.
Richard spoke first. "Norman has been
here the longest," he said.
"That's as may be," said Tim, "but Peter
definitely arrived before Oliver."
"I know Norman arrived before Michael,
anyway," continued Richard, ignoring Tim as
usual.
"Michael arrived after Peter," said Tim.
Steve shook himself out of his post-lecture
sleep to mutter, "Michael arrived before Len."
" A n d L e n arrived before O l i v e r , " said
Richard.
"Oliver wasn't the last to arrive, though,"
Steve replied.
I knew which discipline each belonged to, I
knew that the first statement the statistician
had made was true, and this knowledge,
coupled with the fact that no two lecturers
had arrived simultaneously enabled me to
determine with complete certainty the order
in which the staff had arrived.
What was that order?
Solutions, comments and criticisms to me
at the FELIX Office, please. There is a prize
of £5 (donated by Mend-a-Bike) for the
correct entry randomly selected at 1:00pm on
Wednesday.
Welcome to the first puzzle that I've set. I
shall, as this coming year's Puzzles Editor, be
making a full statement in the first FELIX of
next term. This one should keep you going,
however, so good luck everyone!
