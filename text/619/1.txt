SAFE
ONCE
AGAIN!
Mike, the 1701b micrometer mascot of Imperial College Union, has been
found in the Union Office only a few feet from where it was last seen.
On the morning of June 28,
incoming Hon Sec Mary Freeman
discovered Mike in a corner of the
Union Administrator's office
hidden in a cardboard box which
she and other Union Officers
believed to be empty.
Prior to this, M i k e had been
missing since its presumed theft
nearly six weeks previously. Its
discovery so close to home has
caused considerable embarrass-
ment to both the old and the new
E x e c s , w h o must either n o w
accept that the security of the
U n i o n Office is extraordinarily
lax since it has been broken into
twice in two months, or else
admit that their repeated search-
i n g f o r the m i c r o m e t e r was
singularly ineffective.
R u m o u r
Indeed, the incoming Exec
tried to suppress the story of
where M i k e was found, relating
instead another rumour that it
had been found elsewhere.
M r R e e v e s , C o l l e g e C h i e f
Security Officer, had suspected
that M i k e could still be in the
U n i o n Building, and the day
before it was f o u n d he also
searched the building but didn't
look in the U n i o n Office itself
since he assumed it had been
t h o r o u g h l y s e a r c h e d by the
U n i o n staff.

Union still without
DP as Greenstreet
fails exams
Late in June the Union was thrown into turmoil when Deputy President-
elect Phil Greenstreet failed his third year Physics exams. The Union
Constitution requires its officers to achieve "academic standing" and so
Mr Greenstreet is unable to take up the post.
It was hoped that M r Greenstreet could register for a course next
year, allowing h i m to stand for re-election early in the autumn term.
Negotiations between Nick M o r t o n , Steve G o u l d e r and College
resulted in the idea being accepted, and several departments were
a p p r o a c h e d . D e s p i t e an i n i t i a l l y h o p e f u l response f r o m the
departments of Physics and Metallurgy, no department would accept
him, since offering a place to someone who would immediately leave
to take up a sabbatical appointment would in effect waste a vacancy
for the new intake.
A t present N i c k M o r t o n and Christine Teller are performing the
Deputy President's duties, but there will have to be elections at the
beginning of the session to find a permanent replacement for M r
Greenstreet. Papers will go up in the first week of next term, with
h u s t i n g s a n d e l e c t i o n s i n t h e t h i r d a n d f o u r t h w e e k s .
However, the poor turn out for the last elections and the likely
inexperience of much of the electorate (about one third will be
f r e s h m e n a n d have little experience of the U n i o n , a n d m a y
consequently not vote) begs the question of whether the elections will
be quorate, and if so what sort of candidate will be successful.
The last time a sabbatical officer
failed was three years ago when
J o h n S h u t t l e w o r t h , F E L I X
Editor-elect, failed his second
year maths exams. A t that time
it was not explicitly part of the
C o n s t i t u t i o n that s a b b a t i c a l s
had to be of academic standing;
M r Shuttleworth took the U n i o n
to court, but lost his case.
Successes
T h e o t h e r s a b b a t i c a l s d i d
somewhat better; M a r t i n Taylor,
the new F E L I X E d i t o r , is a
postgraduate and was declared
of a c a d e m i c s t a n d i n g by his
supervisor, while President Steve
G o u l d e r a n d H o n Sec M a r y
Freeman graduated with a lower
second and a third respectively.
