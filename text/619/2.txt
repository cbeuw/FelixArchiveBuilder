A s last year, the Rally was i n

back. Answering the questions
took the team to places as varied
as the church o f St Andrew-by-
the-Wardrobe, the headquarters
of the Magic Circle, a n d the
surgery o f D r Phang, a dentist in
Hammersmith and i n the other
part o f the test several teams
enjoyed morning coffee at the
Ritz, so that they would be able
to present the receipt with their
treasure.

it was a close finish, with the
'21296' team winning by two
points. Congratulations to them
and to everyone who took part.
