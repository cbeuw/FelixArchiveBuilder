July customarily heralds the release of the
m a j o r d i s t r i b u t o r s ' b i g s u m m e r f i l m s .
However, the best offering of the months
comes from a small independent distributor
and is only showing at one cinema.
W e r n e r H e r z o g ' s Fitzcarraldo ( A ,
Camden Plaza) is remarkable in many ways. It
continues this director's long association with
the extraordinary Klaus Kinski who stars as
B r i a n S w e e n y F i t z g e r a l d ( k n o w n a s
Fitzcarraldo because nobody can pronounce
his name), an Irishman attempting to make his
fortune in Peru at the turn of the century. H e
has one lifelong obsession: to build an opera
house in the jungle and bring his beloved opera
to the Indians, but first he must obtain the
money.
* After several unsuccessful enterprises,
Fitzcarraldo hits upon a fantastic scheme
which involves dragging a massive riverboat
over a hill between two rivers. This unlikely
event provides the centrepiece of an epic film
which chronicles one man's obsessive struggle
against nature to achieve his goal.
It is beautifully filmed, with Herzog making
great use of his South American locations. T o
a d d to this K i n s k i gives a n o t h e r great
performance in the lead role, with strong
support from the rest of the cast (including the
A m a z o n i a n Indians). A n interesting, awe-
inspiring story completes the creative cycle.
I can't say that the film is exciting (in the
'action' sense at least), but it's strong images
held my attention and interest for the full two
and a half hour running time.
The fact that Herzog actually moved a full-
size riverboat over a hill makes it an even more
impressive and fascinating achievement.
Grotesque caricatures drawn from the mind
of Pink Floyd's Roger Waters populate the
screen adapatation of their hugely successful
d o u b l e a l b u m The Wall ( A A , E m p i r e
Leicester Square). Pink ( B o b Geldof) is
Waters' depressed rock star whose disturbed
Fitzcarraldo (Klaus Kinski) moves mountains.
life story is told in flashback while he sits,
isolated, in a hotel room.
Director Alan Parker, whose other credits
include Midnight Express and Fame, has used
the opportunity to present a complex and
demanding film without dialogue. F l o y d ' s
m u s i c is left t o tell t h e s t o r y w h i l e a
combination of live action and occasional piece
of Gerald Scarfe's excellent animation give
flesh to the ideas contained therein.
P i n k ' s life seems to have been one of
continual hardship; he loses his father, is
s m o t h e r e d by h i s l o v i n g m o t h e r , gets
humiliated at school and ends up losing his
wife to another man. In desperation he locks
himself into his room and attempts to retract
from the real world until he verges on insanity.
Needless to say all this sounds pretty
standard rockstar fare, but Alan Parker and
Gerald Scarfe manage to create real nightmares
on the screen which succeed in making The
Wall a dynamic (and occasionally breath-
taking) film. If you enjoyed the album you'll
probably love it and if not, it may change your
mind.
The first of the batch of science fiction
biggies which will descend on the country in
the next few months is Star Trek II: The
Wrath of Khan (A, selected A B C s ) .
K h a n (Ricardo M o n t a l b a n ) is a genetic
superman left stranded on a planet by Captain
K i r k in o n e of the T V e p i s o d e s . H e is
unwittingly discovered by Commander Chekov
and commandeers his ship to seek revenge on
Kirk, who is now an Admiral.
In the best traditions of the series Admiral
Kirk has coincidentally left his desk on earth
and is accompanying Captain Spock o n a
training mission aboard The Enterprise. When
Khan steals a deadly device named Project
G e n e s i s , T h e E n t e r p r i s e , with its largely
inexperienced crew, is sent to the rescue once
more.
The comic book storyline is, unfortunately,
not accompanied by a well paced and exciting
screenplay. The film drags at times and the
direction is a little flat, but despite this (or
perhaps because of this) the magic of the
television show, as embodied in all the main

Scotty, Sulu and Uhura exchange dialogue
and meaningful stares in the normal manner,
but I can't help feeling that the director has let
the stars rest on their T V laurels rather than
push for a bigger and better Star Trek movie.
Anyway, the escape from the inescapable
and the final scenes of Spock's death (the most
over-hyped 'secret' of the year) almost moved
me to t e a r s . A l l of y o u w h o h a v e f o n d
memories of Star Trek from your childhood
will probably feel the same.
Talking of hype, Clint Eastwood's latest
vehicle Firefox ( A A , showing just about
everywhere) must have the largest advertising
budget for.years. Not only did the posters go
up months in advance, but pictures of Clint
with C C C P emblazoned on his chest seem to
leap out of every newspaper, T V and film
screen around. " W h y all the fuss?" I hear you
ask.
Well, what the ad men call 'hard sell' can be
commonly translated as flogging a dead horse.
The Firefox of the title turns out to be a deadly
Russian aircraft which Clint is sent behind the
