up doing a boring twenty minute runner (or
should it be flyer?) at the end. Even the flying
scenes are pretty ropey—not recommended.
The re-release of Fantasia ( U , O d e o n
Haymarket) with a completely new digital
soundtrack is a welcome move. This was
Disney at his best: creative, innovative and
entertaining. The film is actually quite shallow,
being no more than a series of pretty pictures
go with some marvellous music, but it's meant
to be nothing more.
The new soundtrack is beautifully clear—sit
back and enjoy it.

The Secret of Nimh (Cert U)
The Secret of Nimh is a full-length children's
cartoon made by Don Bluth and and a group
of Disney animators who became disillusioned
with the Disney stereotype and decided to set
up on their own.
It is clear that the group owes a lot to
Disney. The use of colour and music and the
animation were more or less exactly as I
remember Disney cartoons (although it's a
long time since I've seen one) but this is no
criticism; for this type of film it is exactly what's
required. 's
The main improvement is in the plot, which
manages to avoid the awful predictability of
Disney. Mrs Brisby, a recently widowed lady
mouse, has to move her house and children
from the field which is about to be ploughed.
While enlisting help from Jeremy, the over-
' enthusiastic crow and the cantakerous Auntie
Shrew she begins to realise there is another,
much bigger concern which keeps posing all
kinds of awkward questions: W h o are the Rats
of Nimh? Why is the chemist mouse, M r
Ages, so secretive about his work? A n d why
does everyone revere her late husband so
greatly and how did he die? It is only as Mrs B
begins to investigate the rats and eventually
meets the awesome Nicodemus (with a superb
voice supplied by Derek Jacobi) that she
learns the answers to her questions and
realises the magic power of her husband's
amulet.
It is this intrigue in the film, the idea that
there are always questions which 'we don't
know the answer to yet' together with the fact
that the comedy in the film is not slapstick but
comes more from interaction of the animals'
characters, which makes it so enjoyable.
One criticism: I found the ending a little too
incredible, even within the fantasy context of
the film as a whole. A n d I was surprised at a
couple of s e q u e n c e s whose only purpose
seemed to be as anti-vivisection propaganda.
To sum up then, it is really a children's film,
albeit a fine one and not really worth going out
of your way to see. O n the other hand if you
can find an excuse to take a group of eight-
year-olds to the cinema, don't hesitate.

A still from Fantasia
Theatre
The Admirable Bashville, The Dark Lady
of the Sonnets and a Midsummer Night's
Dream, presented by the New Shakes-
peare Company at the Open Air Theatre,
Regent's Park.
The Admirable Bashville is an unusually
pure d i s t i l l a t i o n of S h a v i a n s i l l i n e s s . A
romantic squib set in the old empire days, it
concerns a refined lady of letters who instantly
falls in love with a boxer jogging through the
grounds of her house. Plots rarely come as silly
as this. Among elements featured in the plot
are: the lady's butler, Bashville, whose love of
his mistress secretly pent up in his breast is
vented in an eruption of anguish and disgust
on realising his lady's passion for a mere boxer
(silly), a boxing match that continues long after
the contestants have left the ring (slightly silly),
and a head-on collision between some African

s a v a g e s a n d m e m b e r s of the E n g l i s h
aristocracy (incredibly silly).
B e r n a r d S h a w w r o t e The Admirable
Bashville to prove a point. He boasts: "I took
the opportunity of producing a masterpiece to
show that I had the Shakespeare technique at
my fingers' ends' if I chose to use it. Also, I
wanted to give a practical proof of what I had
so often alleged — that it is the easiest
technique in the w o r l d . " T h e result is a
ridiculous but amusing orgy of words. Fine
performances are given by Emily Richard and
Peter W o o d w a r d as the lady and b o x e r
respectively. A n d by Douglas Hodge as the
poor butler.
The silliness of The Admirable Bashville is
surpassed only by the cheekiness of The Dark
Lady of the Sonnets (the two plays are
presented as a double-bill). This play is even
more liable to upset lovers of Shakespeare. In
t h i s s h o r t w o r k , S h a k e s p e a r e ( D a v i d
Whitworth) intrudes upon the premises of
Queen Elizabeth I (Helen Ryan), and makes an
appeal for an establishment of a National
Theatre. But Shaw's portrayal of Shakespeare
is definitely not gratifying; the great dramatist
seizes upon and ecstatically jots down the
most banal phrases lightly uttered by the
Queen, in the way a dishevelled tramp would
stoop down and gleefully pick up odd fag ends.
A 'dark lady' also appears in this humorous
play (played by Janet Spencer-Turner)—the
Dark Lady so often referred to in Shakes-

unhappiness.
The production of A Midsummer Night's
Dream is n o w r e v i e w e d ( f o r t h o s e
Shakespeare lovers who have managed to
read this far). The very best Puck in the land
has been s e c u r e d for this p r o d u c t i o n :
Christopher Biggins. Biggins is best known to
the public for the big brand of villian he has
created after his appearance as Nero in B B C
TV's award-winning / Claudius. Possessing the
appearance of an overgrown schoolboy slob,
he plays a rotund, mischievous, mushroom-
chomping Puck.
The Dream is a complex play which has
inspired many, including seekers of the
supernatural. The fairies, sprites and spirits (or
elementals as they are called by present day
respectability-seeking mystics) have always
amused or tantalised people down the ages.
