Five Star
Tenancy
The Estates Section of College is
currently negotiating with the
owners of the Fremantle Hotel
in Cromwell Road for the use of
the hotel as a new Head Tenancy
which will provide additional
student accommodation for the
next three years. Conversion of
the building is expected to start
during the nextfew weeks and it
will be completed in time for the
new intake in late September.
The hotel, which is about
fifteen minutes walk from
College, will house about 160
students in single and double
rooms. Although it will be let
under the Head Tenancy scheme,
it is large enough to be run in the
manner of a conventional Hall
of Residence, with large kitchens
and a launderette. There will
also be a communal lounge and
residents will have the use of the
private garden at the back of the
hotel. Rents for single rooms will
be approximately the same as for
Southside rooms.
The new residence will allow
College to achieve a longstanding
aim of offering all first years a
room in Hall.
Student
SuesLST
London Student Travel have
agreed to pay out £28.75 in
settlement of a summons issued
against them by an e x - I C
student.
According to Paul Charlton,
the tickets he was sold at LST's
Imperial branch were over £20
more expensive than advertised.
This, he was told, was because of
the fluctuations in the rate of
exchange. When he later dis-
covered that he has simply been
sold more expensive tickets he
asked LST to refund the dif-
ference. They refused saying the
position had been made clear to
M r Charlton when he bought the
tickets. Since he had a witness to
the transaction, M r Charlton
decided to sue, and shortly after
the summons was issued LST
offered to settle out of court.
The Association of British
Travel Agents, a body which
protects consumers' interests in
such matters, has been informed
of the s u m m o n s , and M r
C h a r l t o n has expressed his
concern that L S T is not a
member of the Association.
200,000
Babies
Professor Scorer of the Depart-
ment of Mathematics was on the
panel at a press conference to
launch 'The Shape of Things to
Come', a booklet published by
the pressure group Population
Concern to bring home the
implications of the current rate
of population growth.
The booklet consists mainly of
a compilation of frightening
statistics (did you realise the
population of the world is
increasing by 200,000 every
day?) and stresses the importance
of sound education in the Third
World, particularly with regard
to birth control, the benefits of
an efficient health service, and
women's rights.
Boat Trip
to Austria
IC student Tors Anderson,
Mech Eng 2, was a member of
the British Rowing team at the
world championships in Vienna
last week, where his boat
finished fourth. Union President
Steve G o u l d e r and College
Secretary J o h n S m i t h had
agreed to contribute towards
Mr Anderson's expenses, and
the Union and the College each
paid £125.
Floats Like
a Brick
IC took two of the design
awards in the Concrete Canoe
championships held at Thorpe
Park on 20 June. The IC canoe,
designed by Mike Rowley, Civ
Eng 3, as part of his final year
project, was made of high-
alumina cement on a fine glass
fibre base. These materials were
chosen to combine flexibility
with strength, and consequently
it was possible to keep the
weight of the canoe down to
about 30kg which is almost as
light as many fibreglass canoes.
When it came to actually
paddling it though, IC did not
do so well, and most of the top
racing awards went to teams
from Manchester and R A F
Shrewsbury.
What Goes
Up
The infamous Lower Lounge
partition was demolished last
week after a life of less than a
year, to make way for the new
catering outlet which is to open
next session. It is hoped that the
new outlet will offer a different
and more relevant selection of
foods than the present refectory.
