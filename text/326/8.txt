GUILDSHEET
In Felix last week M r . R. Appleby (or is it Miss?)
started his (or her) article;
"It seems that a large proportion of R C S enthusiasts
and Guildstwats are unaware of the active rivalry that
took place, more or less continuously, throughout last
term between the unions of these two constituent col-
leges."
It would seem to me, however, that the person know-
ing least of what went on was M r . Appleby himself.
In the last paragraph of his article he refers to the
abduction of the Guilds' Fruit, collected for M o r p h y
Day, from Guilds' U n i o n Office. This both mystifies
and surprises me. Does M r . Appleby really think
Guilds would store rotten fruit in their lovely clean
union office? Surely not. The fruit was stored nowhere
near the Union Office — in fact it was in one of the
lock-up sheds under Exhibition R o a d , in front of Mech.
Eng. It was from here that R C S forcibly broke the lock
and stole the fruit. This stupid and useless sortie
achieved nothing — except for making R C S smell even
more than usual.
Reference was also made to the relieving of Guilds
of some yellow shields. Once again M r . Appleby is far
from the complete truth. The occasion he refers to, I
a m sure, is when Guilds were busy finishing their float
for the L o r d Mayor's Show. A bunch of supposed res-
ponsible citizens then rushed into the union office and
just picked up everything in sight, including students'
folders, and most important some polystyrene letters
which had been prepared for Guilds' float. They then
rushed out again, droping litter all over Mech. Eng.
and breaking half the letters. After some time these
letters were regained by Guilds, but a large number had
to be remade. This complete irresponsibility of R C S
nearly sabotaged Guilds' noble act of holding high
the hand of Imperial College at the L o r d Mayor's
Show. I wonder why M r . Appleby left this informa-
tion out of his article?
A n d now for an earth-shattering disclosure. Three
attempts by R C S have failed to locate their beloved
Union Office Sign, but Guilds will now tell them where
it is. Yes folks, only R C S could fail to look in the
most obvious place. Ever since Guilds have had pos-
session of this sign it has been O N S H O W for all to
see in the G U I L D S ' T R O P H Y C A B I N E T . R C S must
all be blind, I suppose.
Perhaps in future M r . Appleby will get his facts
right. It wouldn't improve the general hopeless stan-
dard of Broadsheet anyway.

B R A D F O R D U N I V E R S I T Y U n i o n has negotiated an
exclusive contract with Whitbreads which includes the
purdhase by the U n i o n of a real pub, which will be
restored. This is the second time in five years that the
Union has achieved such a contract — no other U n i o n
has managed it once.
LEEDS UNIVERSITY, who have already got five
sabbatical officers, rejected the creation of a further
two posts, but accepted one — Deputy President for
Welfare. The two that failed to gain acceptance were
House Secretary and Honorary Secretary, on the
grounds that there was not enough work to justify
the expense.
C A M B R I D G E S T U D E N T S ' U N I O N , beset by low-
quorum difficulties, are to drastically alter their consti-
tution. There will be fewer U G M ' S , the powers of the
exec, will be increased to allow them to initiate policy
without a U n i o n mandate, and the quorum will be
increased from 250 present to 250 or 350 voting in
favour.
At NONINGTON COLLEGE OF PHYSICAL EDU-
CATION, the College authorities are trying to take
out an injunction against the President, Angela Little-
wood, to stop her entering college premises. Their
grounds are that she is no longer a student. Readers
will remember the troubles that arose last term when
the Union attempted to get a sabbatical president,
something the governors of Nonington have consis-
tently refused to accept. The case comes before the
High Court in ten days' time.
L A N C A S T E R U N I V E R S I T Y lis proposing to set aside
a number of places every year to students not prepared
to state their specialisation at the time of application,
Which means that they can dedide which course to
take when they arrive at university.
EDINBURGH'S "Curators of Patronage" are to con-
sult every sector of the university — including students
— on the choice of a new Principal (Sir Michael Swann,
at present holding the post, is taking over the post of
Director-General of the BBC). The post is to be ad-
vertised — it is believed that this is the first time this
has been done in Britain.

The story so far: "In the beginning were the A l ' s ,
also were the A2's, but those days have now passed.
F o r there was a famine over the land. A n d the captain
said 'Give us your best to play for the extras'. A n d
they gave their best.
The A2's were tried on the field called Harlington
and they triumphed over their adversary and a plague
of excrement fell amongst their adversary. After they
retired to the Inn and they rejoiced. But their rejoicing
was short, and there was a weeping and wailing and
gnashing of teeth. F o r the Angel of Apathy descended
on the Xtras and they were scattered. A n d the Captain
said 'Let there be a sacrifice lest the Xtras vanish from
the earth', and they took the A2's and broke them
assunder and scattered them amongst the Xtras and
the A Is, and the A2's were no more. A n d thus there
was the A ' s . "
But to get up to date, the record so far of the A ' s has
not been too successful (to scare away opposition) the
record this term i s : —

We hope to keep readers up to date on the progress
of this side (by writing the match report on Saturday
night . . . before we all get too pissed). After all it is
the team of the common man. W e would like to take
this opportunity to thank all those who are willing to
turn up regularly. I would mention your names only I
can't remember them.
Friends and hope

failed to turn up to their exams. The U n i o n is Object-

MANCHESTER UNIVERSITY and UMIST are to
adopt Britain's first scheme for evaluating lecturers'
teaching abilities, under a scheme being run by their
Adult Education Department. Manchester has one
of the few lecturers in higher education in the country.
L A N C A S T E R students are fighting against a new
disciplinary code, and staff are refusing to approve
it until they are satisfied that discipline Will be enforced.
The students claim that the rules, the same for both
students and staff, are only applied to the former, and
there is "one law for the rich and one for the poor."
