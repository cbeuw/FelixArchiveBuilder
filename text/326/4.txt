Marxist
Misconcep-
tions
Sir, — A letter in last
week's Felix created some
misconceptions about tne
Marxist analysis of society—
misconceptions fostered by
those who wish to artificially
divide students from the rest
of the working class.
Karl Marx realised that
the social and political fab-
ric of society is determined
by the economic structure
and therefore correctly ana-
lysed that there are only
classes in advanced cap-
italist society (i.e. that in
Britain today) — those who
own the means of production
and exploit the labour of
others (capitalists or bour-
geoisie) and those who are
exploited (the proletariat).
Exploitation comes about be-
cause the workers are paid
less than the value of the
commodities they produce.
The difference is called sur-
plus value and is divided up
among various sections of
the bourgeoisie (employers,
land owners, government,
etc.).
It is easy to see these re-
lations in production in the
case of a worker in a factory
but they are equally in exis-
tence in the case of all other
people who are employed by
the capitalist system. For ex-
ample: it is not obvious what
commodity a shop assistant
produces, however such a
person still produces surplus
value in that the value pro-
duced by her labour 'i.e. the
part she plays in producing
the profit made by the shop
as a whole) is less than the
wages she receives. Such a
relationship exists in all
forms of employment. The
aim of the capitalist class is
to make a profit out of em-
ploying workers (this is the
only way profit can be made)
and so no worker is em-
ployed unless a profit is
made from his labour.
Students are in no way
separate from society and so
must enter into the same
economic relationship. Stu-
dents do not exploit the
labour of others and are
therefore not capitalists. In
training a student, value is
produced for the capitalist
class in the form of greater
skills given to the student in
order that the student may
produce a greater amount of
surplus value in future em-
ployment. The amount of the
surplus value produced dir-
ectly due to this extra train-
ing received is greater than
the amount it costs for the
bourgeoisie to train the stu-
dent (including the grant
paid to the student) or it
would not be profitable for
the capitalist class to give
such training. Therefore the
student is exploited as a s t u -
dent, however the surplus
value produced during his
period as a student is only
realised later during employ-
ment.
There can be no sections
of society that areclassless,
such people could not exist
in a capitalist society with-
out taking part in the capital-
ist production relations as
there are no other stable
forms of existence. The mis-
conception put forward in the
letter arises from not under-
standing how workers other
than industrial workers do in
fact produce surplus value
and from confusing subject-
ive ideas of class with the ob-
jective definition. This gives
rise to a fictitious middle
class (including teachers,
d o c t o r s , "intellectuals",
higher paid workers, etc. the
list being subjective in ori-
gin can be extended indefi-
nitely) who have however no
separate relation with the
means of production and
therefore cannot form a
class.
If in fact one limits the
proletariat to those who work
in factories one arrives at a
situation where the "working
class" is very small and de-
creasing steadily in number
(with mechanization) which
is in contradiction to Marx's
analysis. If this were true
how could the situation arise
where the proletariat be-
comes strong enough to
seize power and overthrow
capitalism?
Sections of society that
previously regarded them
selves as middle class are
beginning to realise that their
position is no different to that
of industrial workers and
therefore are beginning to
fight exploitation in the same
way as industrial workers
(e.g. civil servants, teachers,
nurses, etc.). This is a great
political advance for our
class. One of the main hin-
drances to struggle among
such sections of the proletar-
iat as students is the notion
that we are middle class and
somehow privileged. Stu-
dents are increasingly be-
ginning to realise that this is
not so. Revolutionaries
should aim at destroying il-
lusions not reinforcing them
with false analysis.
Yours sincerely,

Mein Herr, — / must pro-
test at the space wasted in
your fine newspaper by be-
ing filled by Mr. Appleby,
the perpetrator of a certain
obscene publication. Obvi-
ously the circulation of his
tabloid is so bad that he has
to seek further outlets for
his filth. What particularly
struck me about his atricle
was the complete distortion
of the truth. As the first sen-
tence implied, this article
was aimed at those who
have no knowledge of the
day to day events of College
life with the obvious inten-
tion of persuading them that
r.c.s. is worth knowing
about. It is therefore for the
benefit of these ignorant
peasants that I, as the cham-
pion of truth, liberty, and all
that crap, without dwelling
too long on this sordid ar-
ticle, would like to put the
record straight on a couple
of points.
Firstly, it was stated that
on two occasions, the sup-
posed cream of this scien-
tific college were unable to
find the sign that they
missed in the room that they
entered so rudely to look for
it. Had they in fact ap-
proached the C. & G. Union
Office in a more appropriate
manner, they would no doubt
have been invited to gaze up-
on their sign, which is today
where it was then, tastefully
displayed in a glass case to-
gether with a similar sign
from the mining school and
other trophies.
Secondly, in addition to
the objects stated to have
been removed from the C. &
G. Union Office, the r.c.s.
"revenge squad" saw fit to
take with them records, pap-
ers, files, collecting-cans,
and personal property, ar-
ticles which are not mascots
and are properly considered
inviolate, into which category
must fall the shields referred
to, which any fool could re-
move anyway. In addition, an
ash-tray removed by the
"squad", if such a rabble
can be so called, was im-
mediately and deliberately
smashed. If such vandalism
is Mr. Appleby's idea of in-
ter-union rivalry, then I sug-
gest that he encourages his
fellow louts to carry it on
with the school of mines, the
well-known float saboteurs.
Yours spherically

Folk
Sir, — On reading this
week's Felix Diary, I was
very disturbed to find that
you are now giving free pub-
licity to outside organisa-
tions while stabbing IC soci-
eties in the back. Specifically
you advertised the Holy
Ground Folk Club on the
same night as IC Folk Club.
Whilst you may be within
your rights to do this it is
clear that IC societies will
suffer as a result of your ac-
tions.
IC Folk Club is in finan-
cial difficulties this year any-
way and any efforts to re
verse this situation will be
ruined if this irresponsible
sabotage by the organ of the
Union continues.
M. J. SIMMONS
President IC Folk Club
Inquorate
meetings
Sir, — / am continually
shocked and disappointed at
the methods used by IC
Union Executive to prolong
inquorate Union General
Meetings.
The habit of opening a
"Meeting of IC Students"
immediately after closing a
UGM is repugnant to all
those members of the Union
with a trace of democracy in
their souls.
As I understand the sys-
tem, in order to ensure that
Union Meetings are repre-
sentative, a quorum of mem-
bers is fixed, below which
business is not conducted.
Standing orders incorporate
the provision that "the meet-
ing is deemed inquorate until
challenged" so that non con-
tentious matters such as an-
nouncements may be made.
At last Thursday's meet-
ing the Exec openly flouted
these principles and took a
vote on a v e r y contentious
subject — a refectory boy-
cott — when only about 1S0
members were present.
I find it very difficult to be-
lieve that we really need
union meetings every week
— be they General or Extra-
ordinary -—- as this will only
serve to bore and alienate
the average "moderate"
member and result in only
political activists attending
meetings.
I remain, in hope of a re-
turn to visible democracy.
Yours faithfully,
C H A R L E S R U S S D E N
