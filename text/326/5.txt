The chances are that, for a l l of u s , t h e d a y w i l l
c o m e w h e n w e w i l l think about buying a home of
our o w n . T o s o m e it m a y s e e m a remote possibility,
to others, something to be thinking about n o w . B u t
whichever category we're i n , i t ' s o d d s o n that w e
have very little idea of h o w to g o about it.
H o w d o y o u b u y a house? W h e r e d o y o u get the
m o n e y ? W h a t is a mortgage? W h o d o y o u a s k ?
H o w m u c h c a n y o u borrow? A n d — f o r the scep-
t i c s — w h y buy a house at a l l ?
W e l l these are the kind of questions w h i c h
FELIX F I N A N C I A L L Y ' s o w n expert, D E R E K E. C U M -
M I N G S w i l l be talking about w h e n he delivers the
s e c o n d of h i s General Studies Lectures at Imperial
College next week—-February 6.
H e will be delighted to answer your q u e s t i o n s —
and even more delighted to relay them to the m a n
he w i l l be bringing to the lecture, M r . L. R. Pask,
Branch M a n a g e r of o n e of the biggest b u i l d i n g
societies in the land.
T h o s e of y o u w h o have been reading FELIX
F I N A N C I A L L Y since the start of the a c a d e m i c year
w i l l k n o w that Derek C u m m i n g s usually has s o m e
fairly stringent a n d provocative things to s a y about
the financial w o r l d a n d the w a y it touches u s , t h e
c o n s u m e r s . A n d his s e c o n d lecture promises to be
no less contentious.
Furthermore, he is providing y o u with the oppor-
tunity to throw questions at o n e of the m e n whose
job it is to lend money to prospective house pur-
chasers.
Y o u w i l l perhaps have read an interview with
M r . Pask w h i c h w e published last term in w h i c h he
described the attitudes of h i s company towards
lending money to young people. O f necessity, it
was a brief resume of the situation. Perhaps there
are other questions y o u w o u l d like to put.
H o w does a b u i l d i n g society decide w h e n to lend
m o n e y ? Does it have to be tied to your income at
the time o f application, or does it take account o f
prospects? A r e there ways of graduating repay-
ments to suit improving i n c o m e ? W i l l the escala-
tion of house prices ever s l o w d o w n ? If not, w h y
not.
Those are the kind of things y o u might like to
have answers to. Y o u have questions of your o w n
to a s k ? Fine. A s k them.
Y o u never know. T h e right answer n o w might
save you a hell of a lot of problems later.
So there's a lovely red-brick semi to the north of
Finchley Road . . . Like the legendary yellow idol
of K h a t m a n d u , getting possession of it c a n be a
tricky process. It involves building societies, banks,
solicitors, the Land Registry, search fees, deposits,
contracts, etc., etc.
If the prospect of going through with it boggles
your m i n d , then please read o n . For this week, w e
thought it w o u l d be useful to describe the s u e -
F E E I X F I N A N C I A L L Y
cession o f events through w h i c h the prospective
house-buyer has to go in order to b u y his dream
house.
So here goes.
First, as M r s . Beeton w o u l d say, find your house.
It has to be something y o u can afford and something
you like. Given that, the process is as follows:
The estate agent handling the property will want
some concrete proof that y o u are talking with
serious intent. In other words, he'll want money. H e
may want a hundred pounds. I suggest you give h i m
twenty-five q u i d . He'll very likely accept it.
Next, find a building society with a manager w h o
appears sympathetic a n d he'll give y o u an applica-
tion form for a mortgage.
This is a pretty comprehensive questionnaire. It
will want to know where you work a n d what your
income is a n d where your figure c a n be verified. It
w i l l also require you to say if y o u have any other
debts, such as an overdraft or hire purchase c o m -
mitments.
It will want full details of the house you want to
buy: the address, the asking price, the rateable
value, the type of construction a n d the date it w a s
built. A t the same time, the building society will
want their survey f e e — u s u a l l y about twenty-five
pounds.
Y o u will also have to supply the name o f your
solicitor, since from this moment, all c o m m u n i c a -
tions will go to h i m .
Therefore, find yourself a lawyer w h o looks a n d
sounds as if he knows what he is doing a n d is able
to d o it with some dispatch. A s sbon as you have
sent your application back to the building society,
fire the gun a n d get the solicitor moving. T h e next
few pieces of the puzzle are going to depend on h i m .
W h i l e the b u i l d i n g society is checking out your
personal standing a n d making their survey of the
house, your solicitor should be busy checking o n
the legal state of your new home.
This is called T h e Search. A n d it is literally that.
Your solicitor must find out from the local authority
whether, for example, a motorway is due to be built
across the spot where your house stands. H e must
ascertain what planning proposals there are in the
v i c i n i t y — a multi-storey car park or a block of flats
at the end of your garden, for example.
At the same time, he must check w i t h the Land
Registry what covenants there are attached to the
STAPHYLOCOCCUS

M A R T I N D O U G H T Y
s i t e — s u c h things as your not being allowed to keep
a d o g or build a shed or paint the house blue. It's
better to find these things out before y o u move i n ,
for obvious reasons.
There is quite a lot of investigation involved in
all this s o it is as w e l l to get the solicitor away to
a g o o d start and, if necessary, prompt h i m to c o m -
plete the search quickly. It will take the building
society about t w o or three w e e k s to complete their
investigations a n d to make an offer, a n d by then
you need to k n o w the legal score.
So, to T h e Offer. T h e most crucial bit of the
whole operation.
If the building society offers to lend you what y o u
asked for, then you are home a n d dry. But they may
not necessarily d o so.
The crux of the matter is the building society's
valuation of the property. It c o u l d easily be less
than the asking price, for a number of reasons. In
the first place, the vendor might just be greedy a n d
overDrice the house. O n the other hand, there m a y
be hidden structural faults in the building. That does
not mean that t h e roof is about to cave i n : it m a y
be something as simple as faulty floorboards. In any
case, the building society isn't bound to tell y o u
about it. Their opinion of the house will be reflected
in their offer.
The difference is that although they may give y o u
the percentage of mortgage y o u asked f o r — s a y
ninety per c e n t — i t w i l l be a percentage of a lower
figure.
A l l of w h i c h leaves y o u with t w o alternatives.
Either go a n d beat the vendor until he reduces his
price to the building society's v a l u a t i o n — o r borrow
the difference.
One thing is certain. T h e building society will
not budge, a n d y o u c a n either lump it or leave it.
But let's leave aside complications like that for
the moment. Let's assume the building society ful-
fils your hopes a n d offers y o u the money you need.
In accepting their offer, you enter into a legal
contract with them to begin repayments as set out
by them, from the moment they hand over the cash
to the vendor.
In the meant'me, having got the promise of the
money, your solicitor is in a position to exchange
contracts with the v e n d o r s ' solicitors. A n d this i n -
volves the most painful part of it all. For it is then
you have to hand over your money. That is, ten per
cent of the agreed price. A n d it is important that
you d o have ten per cent in your pocket, even
though y o u m a y be getting a ninety-five per cent
mortgage. Y o u will get the other five per cent back,
of course, but y o u have to be in a position to put
down the full ten.
Having done a l l that, you await completion d a y —
normally twenty-eight days after the exchange of
contracts. A n d that, finally, is the day the building
society pays the vendor his money, y o u move i n l -
and start paying.
At that time, too, y o u are also liable to pay your
s o l i c i t o r ' h i s search fees, stamp duties a n d his o w n
conveyancing f e e — w h i c h will depend o n the price
of the property.
In reality, the system works reasonably w e l l —
after a l l hundreds d o it every d a y — a n d the whole
thing should take no more than six to e;
ght weeks.
Providing, that is, that there are no delays.
A v o i d i n g the irritation of delay is really a matter
of organising your affairs properly. M a k e sure y o u
fill out the application form p r o p e r l y — a n d sign it.
M a k e certain that the solicitor y o u choose really
does get moving on the first day a n d keep your eye
on him to make sure he is doing what he ought to be
doing o n your behalf. B e sure y o u have the money
for the deposit when it is required. Inform whoever
is going to verify your income that the building
society is going to contact h i m , a n d check that he
replies immediately.
S m a l l things, a l l of them, but important.
Remember, it's a seller's market. If y o u waste
too m u c h time, someone else c o u l d easily c o m e
along a n d snatch the house from over your head. S o
it's w o ' t h tak:
ng the trouble to see there are no u n -
necessary hold-ups. After a l l , buying a house is
probably going to be the biggest single financial
deal you'll ever get involved i n .
