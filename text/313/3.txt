M A R T I N ' S
President's Piece
-How's that for originality
Last year was notorious for the lack of debates.
Those that did occur were in Union Meetings, and to
ibe of any real value they took up most of the available
time.
This year ICU must gCt some really useful debates
going, either under the auspices of the debating society
or by devoting a complete Union meeting to an issue.
The advantage is not only that people get the chance to
hear all sides of (he argument, but that really represen-
tative Union poicy should come out of it, especially on
external issues which NUS campaigns on.
Certainly we should be members of NUS, as in a great
many cases it works very well for the interests of stu-
dents as a whole (e.g. grants) and also for supporting
grievances on a local level. But so often NUS appears to
be totally unrepresentative. How can we hope to make
NUS more representative if we don't get our own opi-
nions sorted out, and ensure that our conference dele-
gation takes these views forward.
By the way, the post of Chairman of Debates is vacant
so we'd like to hear in the Union Office of anyone inter-
ested in this or just helping out with arrangements and
publicity.
Finally a call for
H E L P ! !
with the thousand and one things that need doing
around the Union, especially in the publicityfield.Come
along to the Union Office and report for duty!
Imperial College is a
vast, sprawling complex
of dilapidated buildings, a
site of learning, a place
for adding a little quality
to living, somewhere to
drink, to eat, to play
games. The only time
during the year when
Imperial College gets to
form a corporate whole
is on Commemoration
Day.
When an IC man grad-
uates, he not only gets a
B.Sc. or BSc(Eng) degree,
he is also awarded the
Associateship of his con-
stituent college — an
ARCS, ARSM or ACGI.
These are more than just
a 'free gift' with a degree;
they are qualifications in
their own right and it is
possible in certain cir-
cumstances to get an
Associateship without a
degree.
Commemoration D a y
is so called because it
Commemorates the visit
to the college in 1945 of
the late King George and
Queen Elizabeth. The cer-
emonies are in many ways
analogous to a school
Speech Day i.e. tedious,
boring and really designed
for the benefit of one's
Mummy and Daddy.
However since one's par-
ents will probably want to
see their little Johnny
walk round the Royal Al-
bert Hall when he gradu-
ates, I would advise
people to go to Commem.
at least once during their
time at IC so that they
can explain what actually
happens—and also to get
a free tea afterwards.
iiiiiiiiii
I I I
Commem. may seem to
be boring and tedious,
but it is the only day in
the College Year when the
college appears together
in one place wearing tech-
nicolour robes. It culmin-
ates in the Commemo-
ration Ball. This year, for
the first time ever, the
Commem. Ball is to be
held within the hallowed
precincts of IC in order
to try and stop the trend
of rising prices in outside
Hotels. There will be an
A l grade meal of five
courses plus wines and
port as well as 'Entertain-
ment' for the incredibly
low price of £4.50 per
double ticket. Further de-
tails including ticket ap-
plication forms can be
obtained from Linda
in the Union Office.
SO YOU THINK YOU
KNOW ABOUT THE
IC BOOICSHOP
We all know that the IC bookshop sells
hooks. Even if you've never been in it, you
know that, because it is obvious. But did
you know about all the other things that
the IC Bookshop sells? Like pens, pencils,
rulers, setsquares, notepaper, file paper,
typewriters, ties, scarves, badges, diaries,
hole punchers, treasury tags, slide rules,
paper clips, tights, exam papers (maybe
we'd better forget that one), birthday
cards, paper handkerchiefs, scarves,
whew, Christmas cards (post early for
Easter), rapidograph pens, geological
hammers, french curves (oh ducky), dye-
line paper and developer, drawing instru-
ments, it goes on and on.
As for books, don't think that it's just
textbooks that they sell. Whether your
fancies lie with Puerto Rican architecture
or novels, you'll find books to suit your
bedside table at the IC BOOKSHOP. Not
forgetting invaluables like "Alternative
London" and "Time Out's book of Lon-
don", and even magazines too.
Admit it. Isn't it time that you paid a
visit to the IC BOOKSHOP ? You never
know what you might find. But you'll need
it sooner or later.
