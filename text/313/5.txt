COMMUNITY
ACTION
Simply, Imperial College Community
Action Group exists to provide anyone who
wishes to help the outside community with
suitable openings and to 'persuade' students
into wanting to give this assistance. The philo-
sophy of Community Action is rather more
complicated but really only becomes relevant
when you are actually involved in doing some-
thing. Therefore, I'll get straight down to the
hard stuff . . . ICC AG's activities.
Playgroups and
Adventure Playgrounds
Community Action has
a playgroup in the Lad-
broke Grove area involv-
ing 50 kids between 2 and
12 years old. This is
roughly divided into a
Saturday and, S u n d a y
playgroup. We meet at
Z.15 at St. Mark's Church
in Lancaster Road. In
future we may have use of
a basement or derelict
house.
These playgroups are
based around the ICCAG
van — outings to Rich-
mond Park, S c i e n c e
Museum, Adventure Play-
grounds, etc.
The playgrounds we are
involved with are Acklam
Road (under Westway),
Lisson Grove and Mary-
lands and Lanhill. They
require people who are
willing regularly one or
two evenings a week or
the occasional weekend.
No particular skills are
required, just the ability
to relate to kids of vary-
ing ages.
"Insight"
"Insight" is a commune
or "stabilizing centre"
accommodating fixing ad-
dicts who they hope even-
tually to get on a with-
drawal programme. It is
situated in a terraced
house at 101 Rushmore
Road, Hackney, E7, to-
tally inconspicuous and so
letting its residents lead a
normal life in the com-
munity.
Caring for people such
as these requires a 24-
hour watch and at present
only two workers can
hardly cope. Help is des-
perately needed. They re-
quire I, Part time workers
particularly at weekends.
2, Co-workers to stay up
all night during the week-
end. 3, Volunteers for a'
jumble sale— (a) To dis-
tribute leaflets; (b) collect
jumble; (c) organise the
hall on the day of the
sale. 4, Suggestions of
possible fund raising ac-
tivities. 5, Full-time wor-
kers (if you feel like drop-
ping out!)
Soup Run.
This occurs at present
every Friday night under
Charing X bridge and
Temple Gardens and in-
volves dishing out soup to
the homeless people who
live there, and also chat-
ting to them and building
up a relationship with
each one as an individual.
It usually starts at about
eleven to twelve midnight
and lasts about two hours,
and most if not all Fri-
days the ICCAG van will
be available to transport
the soup and people.
Maryland and Lanhill
Tenants' Association
The Association meetii
every Monday night in
North Paddington. It is
run by local residents and
students.
Why should such a
group need to exist?
Well, in a landlord-ten-
ant confrontation, the
landlord usually comes off
best. This is especially
true of the Westminster
City Council and their
attitude towards the ten-
ants of the area with the
result that they are being
forced to move or pay
higher rents.
However, with the help
of the group, tenants can
be made aware of their
legal rights (never very
well publicized) and they
were able to start their
have a mouthpiece
through which their views
can be expressed. During
the past year the group
has informed tenants of
the effects of the 'General
I m p r o v e m e n t Area
Scheme' and. the 'Fair
Rents' Act, as well as
sorting out legal prob-
lems. Also, with the help
of money from the I.C.
Rag two years ago, they
own paper, the 'North
Pad. News'.
All these activities,
however, require a good
deal of manpower. Any-
one interested in the Asso-
ciation and its work will
learn a great deal about
tenants' rights by going
along to help out ... You
might even find it useful
yourself one day!
Squatters
There arc many fami-
lies who arc condemned
to live in very over-
crowded conditions —
quite frequently in rooms
seething with damp. But
have you noticed that
there arc always empty
houses around, boarded
up and waiting for demo-
lition? Yet they frequently
stand idle for two or three
years.
The North Pad. Squat-
ters Association has been
trying to correct this con-
flicting situation by ar-
ranging with Westminster
City Council for such
families to be temporarily
housed in these buildings.
As a community, the re-
housed families will work
together to decorate them
and will pay a nominal
rent to the Council.
This legal squatting
scheme has been in opera-
tion in Brentford and
Camden for over a year,
and has been shown to
work well. Help is needed
in locating empty houses,
in publicity and in decor-
ating; and for those who
are really interested, help
in the group's organiza-
tion.
These are only a few of
the activities. We are aslo
involved in visiting lonely
old people, running blood
doning sessions in College,
decorating weekends, etc.
We hope to continuously
be introducing new activi-
ties — so keep in touch.
We also have strong
links with other organiza-
tions and Student Com-
munity Action Groups
and we could probably
put you in touch with
anyone to do anything.

QUEEN
O F
1972-3
Last year, if there ever WAS
a Queen of Jez, no one knew
who she was, since there was
so much trouble over the elec-
tion. This year, Jacqui, who
is in Maths I, got herself
elected at the first RCS union
meeting of the year.
We're afraid we can't tell
you what Jacqui thinks of the
post or the honour because our
reporter just took her picture
and didn't send an interview
. . . but she looks fairly happy
with life even after a week at
I.C.
