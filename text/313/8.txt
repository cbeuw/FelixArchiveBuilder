FELIX Tuesday, October 10, 1972
Now what seems
to be the trouble?
Do you often feel tired, listless and apa-
thetic? Do you wake up in the morning too
weary to face the day ahead? Do you suffer
from constipation, (is there a natural
remedy?), dandruff, acne, nausea and/or
the "understains", (the ones you can't talk
about on I.T.Y.)?
A recent survey bus
shown that these and
various other indescrib-
able maladies are the
curse of staff and stu-
dents at several univer-
sities. If you see your-
self as one of this num-
ber, perhaps you would
care to consider some
possible remedies.
There are those who
would recommend the
efficacy of absorbing
large quantities of alco-
hol and thus attaining a
state of euphoria. This
method is strongly advo-
cated by the well-known
Irish toper, Prof. Oliver
Shamus Hugh Squire in
his paper "Don't buy a
round much any more."
(Work that out at your
leisure).
Others might seek
consolation by discuss-
ing their symptoms with
fellow sufferers at Hypo-
chondriacs anonymous.
A n o t h e r solution
could be to join the jet
set and escape on the
"Holiday of a lifetime"
. . . Fly BOAC — the
head-shrinkers.
Of course, if money is
no object, what is to stop
you spending your pools
and bingo winnings on
a nature cure in an iso-
lated and exorbitant
health farm where you
may experience the dubi-
ous joys of living on
diluted grapefruit juice,
soya beans and seaweed
for a glorious three
months.
However, all these
benefits and more can be
obtained at no expense
by one decisive action
on your part. The first
opportunity to embark
on your new lease of
life will occur on TUES-
DAY, 10 OCTOBER in
Room 162, (in the cor-
ridor leading from En-
trance Hall, College
Block). Here, between
the times 13.30 and 16.30
you may undergo T.B.
Mantoux Test, (skin
test) which will provide
evidence as to your state
of protection from T.B.
Students and younger
staff (under 30) who
have not been tested in
the last five years are
advised to attend. It is
essential to attend again
on TUESDAY 17 OCT-
OBER same time, same
place for reading of the
skin test to decide

by an unsuspecting freshman
"What a nice day," said Mandy, "to visit
the U.G.M. in the Great Hall." It being my
first breathtaking day at I.C., I felt inclined
to agree, nice to meet the student body in
the flesh, as it were. As we entered the
Great Hall considerable confusion seemed
to reign, and being very shy we sat at the
back. In fact, so did everybody else, so
much so that the exec, were obliged to bring
their tables down to us.
After much coughing
and belching into the
microphone, Ian Mac-
kenzie, acting as Presi-
dent of the Union (why
can't one see the real
one??) spoke to us in
low monotones. Exec-
style people rushed
around giving away
yellow sheets of paper
which were intelligently
converted into paper
darts. Needless to say,
the aero engineers' darts
flew much better than
the rest. (I wonder what
department you're in?—
Ed.)
My attention to much
of the valuable informa-
tion imparted to us was
somewhat hindered by
Mandy's caresses (my
mother wouldn't like
Mandy). Martin Black
seductively railroaded
second readings of
numerous motions (can
Martin Black seduce
anything? That is surely
the question—Ed.) as the
acting president nodded
his head in approval.
But my sexual stupor
was abruptly interrup-
ted by the audience dis-
agreeing with the idea
that the exec ought to be
able to impose unlimited
fines on napless unruly
students; but Martin
Black wanted to be
"consistent", and the
execu rallied round to
help him; "No Hassles"
purred the deputy presi-
dent and M a n d y
moaned. But the rest of
the student body was not
to be so stimulated.
Making the best of a
bad job, Commander
Black and Company
urged the delights of
'Council'; a few hands
waved and the offending
piece of inconsistency
was dropped into a buc-
ket labelled 'Council'.
Watch out if you stub
out your dog ends on the
colour T.V. You might
incur some Ultra - Vio-
lence from the Comman-
der and his heavies.
Feeling a worried per-
son, I led Mandy off in
search of the old I and
