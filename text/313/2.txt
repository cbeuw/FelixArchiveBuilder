Conference
is coming...
The NUS Conference on November 24th-
27th looms near. As you may have heard at
the Union General Meeting on Tuesday, the
motions had to be in for it by 5 p.m. last Fri-
day week, and the intrepid IC courier made
NUS headquarters with one and a half
minutes to spare.
Unfortunately, the date
for having the motions in
meant that they could not
be discussed at a Union
Meeting. However, as Rob
Armitage, External Aff-
airs Officer, explained at
Tuesday's meeting, the
amendments stage means
that we can amend our
own motion even ito the
extent of a "delete all and
insert" amendment. A l l
that is essential is that the
motion retains the same
title, and is on the same
subject.
The Union received
copies of all the motions
submitted by all the
unions affiliated to the
NUS on Friday, and
amendments to these mo-
tions have to be in by
Friday, 20th October.
Because of the timing of
Union Meetings, which
are worked out months
in advance, the External
Affairs Committee will
discuss all the motions
and put forward their
ideas about amendments
to the Union meeting on
the 19th October, where
they will be discussed.
There will be a joint
meeting of the NUS dele-
gation and the External
Affairs committee early
this week (see Stop Press
News on page 8) to dis-
cuss IC's action.
Just to give you an idea
of what happens after
then, read on. The NUS
publishes the list of
amendments on the 27th
October. Then the mem-
ber Unions "prioritise"
motions — that is, they
list those motions that
they particularly want
discussed at the confer-
ence . . . needless to say,
Conference cannot discuss
all the hundreds of mo-
tions that are submitted!
This prioritisation has to
be completed by the 10th
November, and about
three days before Confer-
ence the agenda is pub-
lished. But enough of
that when the time comes
— FELIX will have two
reporters at the confer-
ence and will keep you
well informed of what is
going on.
And now, as promised,
here are the motions that
IC has submitted in full.
Although entitled to sub-
mit six, we have only put
in three. They are as fol-
lows:—
THE MOTIONS
1. National Health Service and Private Practice
"Conference recognises that the creation of the
National Health Service was an important reform of
great benefit to all, particularly working people, and
believes that the continuation of private practice is
detrimental to the N.H.S.
"Conference see that the planned reform by H.M.
Government will weaken the service and encourage
private practice, thus discriminating against a great part
of the population.
"Conference therefore:
1. Opposes totally the current plans for re-organisation
of the N.H.S.
2. Is totally opposed to any cut-back in health ex-
penditure
3. Opposes private practice
4. Instructs Endsleigh Insurance not to handle private
health insurance policies.
5. Calls for the disclosure of all corporate private
insurance policies".
2. Czechoslovakia
"Conference notes the increasingly repressive regime
in Czechoslovakia since the Soviet 'Operation' of 1968,
specifically:
1. 200 books were banned recently and 900 more are
expected to 'disappear'; job persecution is rife and
political trials are escalating.
2. 46 people are now on trial for various forms of
'subversion' and 'hostility to the socialist social and
state system'. The overwhelming majority of these
defended themselves on the basis that they are
socialists and communists. These political prisoners
include:—
(i) Jiri Muller, the acknowledged leader of the stud-
ent movement during the Prague spring, who defend-
ed himself by making a heavy political attack on the
bureaucracy. His main witness, Professor Sabata,
stated that 'we are communists in opposition: you
— i.e. the judge, etc., — are not communists'.
(ii) Dr. Jan Tesar, a Marxist historian, who in his
defence told the prosecution that 'your children too
will judge you'.
(iii) Dr. Milian Hubl — elected to the Presidium of
the Czech CP in August 1968.
Muller received a year sentence, Sabata b\ years,
Tesar 6 years and Dr. Hubl 6|- years.
Instructions
"Conference deplores these reactionary political
trials and calls on all C.O.'s to support the activities of
the Committee for Defence of Czech Socialists — a
broad committee of Czech socialist exiles and various
British socialists.
Conference instructs:
NUS EXECUTIVE to affiliate to the Czech Com-
mittee for Defence of Czech Socialists (c/o 32 Belitha
Villas, Nl)
NUS EXECUTIVE to raise the matter with the Inter-
national Union of Students and exert all possible
pressure on them to organise a world campaign
against them, and denounce the trials".
3. Criminal Law Revision
"Conference notes the findings of the Criminal Law
Revision Committee.
"Conference also notes the composition of this com-
mittee, and the fact that the majority of people con-
sulted by the committee were chief constables.
''Conference deplores:
1. The use of the argument of increasing crime rate to
justify curtailing defendants' rights. The principles
of justice are independent of the number of crimes
committed.
2. The proposed changes or discarding of Judges' rules
and hence the right to call a solicitor when taken to
a police station.
3. The proposed changes to the 'right of silence' which
will mean that refusal to answer may be taken as an
admission of guilt".
Yes, folks, at long last, only a week into
term, and the Union Building is still un-
finished. The reason? A "labour dispute" that
affected the supply of materials and delayed
operations in some sections by up to eleven
weeks. However, shouldn't be long now . . .
Major hold-ups are in
the Lower Lounge with
the building of the New
Lounge Bar (estimated
completion in a fortnight)
and the Room at the Top
(RATT) where the delay
is unknown owing to the
supply of fittings. Once
the RATT is finished
though, information and
services should improve
considerably. Prospective
tenants of RATT will in-
clude Accommodation,
Welfare, Insurance, Trav-
el, Bonnie Hartnett (the
Student Counsellor), I.C.
Ents, various leaflets and
bumph, one coffee mach-
ine, some chairs and mag-
azines. So the RATT
could be used as a mini
lounge too. Congestion in
the Union Office will be
greatly reduced, though
by no means will it be-
come less friendly!
RATT can only be re-
garded as an experiment
at the moment and its
full effects are not likely
to be seen until it experi-
ences a full year's opera-
tion, next year. This year
will have seen RATT de-
velop from the drawing
board to operation and
the next few months will
be useful to iron out any
initial hang-ups. So don't
expect too much too
soon.
You may or may not
have noticed the change
of surroundings in Moon-
ey's Union Lower Eating
House. The mini spot-
lights are audio modulat-
ed for use in Discos, etc.
At the moment I am in-
vestigating the existence
of a suitable piece of
music that could enhance
the colour of Mooney
chips.
Further plans for the
Lower Refectory include
removal of those much-
loved wooden chairs and
tables and replacemenjt
(hopefully the same day)
by more modern furni-
ture to fit in with (he new
decor.
Long term plans are
also in the line regarding
the Lower Lounge (if the
bar takes much longer,
then that may be long
term too). The financial
implications of alcove
seating around the win-
dows in both the lounge
and the lower refectory
is being investigated . , .
I'll keep you informed!
That should complete
phases 1 and 2 of the
lower level master plan.
Any plans for re-decorat-
ing and furnishing of the
Union now have to be
long term, otherwise noth-
ing worthwhile ever gets
done and what is done is
futile (e.g. three coats of
arbitrary paint with the
idea of further develop-
ments as happened a year
ago).
So bear with us friends.
Things A R E happening.
Must get back to the
painting . . . .

It's not unusual for people to lose things in college,
nor is it unusual for someone to find something some-
body else has lost. Apparently in the past there's been
a lot of confusion over what to do if you have lost/
found something, and Mr. Dawson. College Security
Officer, is understandably keen to have a set system
for this year.
So would you please address all your enquiries to Mr.
Dawson in Room 164 College Block. If you find some-
thing, please hand it to any security guard, who will
pass it on to Mr. Dawson.
