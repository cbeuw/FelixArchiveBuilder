The last major outdoor rock event this year
could at one stage have become one of the nicest,
and could have been attended by the nicest, best
behaved set of kids since events of this sort be-
came the " i n " thing to have been to. The weather
was not just dry but hot, the groups were, for the
most part, excellent, and it only cost a quid, whoops
what did I say? However, the afternoon ended with
some rather perplexing scenes of violence which
doubt had our eiders shaking their heads and say-
ing "Long-haired, pot-smoking, filthy, lazy and
violent hippies."
Over then to one such
hippy Mr. Clock Work-
orange (no relation)
"Like man when the cats
stand up I gotta make
them sit down again, ya
dig? And those red-
neck newspaper sellers,
I mean they're so uncool
they just ask you to
throw things at them."
Far out man, but isn't
there a difference be-
tween standing up to get
an ultra-good view at
someone else's expense
and standing up briefly
to applaud. And again
there's a difference be-
tween lobbing a Coke
tin to attract someone's
attention and hurling a
ha If-full tin of Party
Seven with intent to
maim. Ah well.
Now to proceed to
the music. The concert
was arranged to comme-
morate the presentation
of the Melody Maker
Pollwinner's awards, al-
though the eventual line-
up wandered a little
from that description.
First on was Fudd, an
Irish group who, Rikki
Farr assured us, had
played to an audience of
7,000 in Dublin three
days previously, but that
may have been because
no top British bands ever
play there; Fudd wfere
not particularly original
and of course no one had
heard of them, so they
were not well received
and didn't play for long.
Focus, first of the
pollwinning g r o u p s ,
came on next and
showed why they were
voted World's Brightest
Hope with a flawless
set, perhaps marred by
the tendency to revert to
the theme of their most
famous song, "Hocus
Pocus" in other songs,
but then it's a superb
piece of music. Tys van
Leer's falsetto voice is
quite unique (sic). In
the next year Focus (they
are Dutch) will prove
that you don't have to be
British or American to
make the grade. They
have a new album out
soon.
Next on — the inter-
vals between the groups
r o c k c i t
the Oval
were never annoyingly
long — were Genesis,
who came sixth in the
"British Brightest Hope"
sections of the Poll. The
group rely on theatrics a
lot, and their songs are
built round complicated
stories such as "Get 'em
Out by Friday" and "The
Return of the Giant Hog-
weed", whose stories
are explained before-
hand by singer Peter
Gabriel around whom
the theatrics evolve. On
one occasion he left the
stage obviously^
give the group an instru-
ment workout, I thought.
but no — he was back
on stage in a couple of
minutes wearing a long
dress and a fox's head.
I don't remember which
piece it was part of, but
doubtless all will be re-
vealed on their new
album "Foxtrot" or when
they play at I.C. on No-
vember 18.
Argent were very
ordinary. Guitarist Russ
Ballard has written
some good songs in the
past, not the least of
them "Hold Your Head
Up" but' the group put
them across as though
the audience should be
on their feet the whole
time, and the songs just
aren't that exciting. To-
wards the end of their
set, as they felt the au-
dience slipping from
their grasp, the songs
and their inane patter in
between became just a
bore. "A big hand for
one of Britain's best
drummers", etc. Some
new songs and a tighter,
less exhibitionist deli-
very of them may return
some respect for Argent.
The crowd, already an-
ticipating the arrival of
Emerson, Lake and
Palmer, had very little.
After Argent had left
the stage, not surpris-
ingly without encore, it
was announced that
there was a surprise for
us. Drummer Pierre van
der Linden and guitarist
Jan Akkerman, both of
Focus, were going
to jam with the world's
best bass guitarist
(as voted for by
Melody Maker readers),
Jack Bruce. It may not
go down in the history
of jam sessions as a vin-
tage one, but consider-
ing that Bruce had pro-
bably never met the
others before, they "got
it together" very well,
and it was a nice way to
pass the time while
E.L.P.'s gear was set up.
Alan Freeman, prob-
ably E.L.P.'s most objec-
tionable fan, introduced
them, and they launched
straight into "Hoedown"
from the new album,
and it was received with
the appropriate ecstasy
that typifies their con-
certs. It would perhaps
be unfair to say that
there were no surprises
in what they played, al-
though this number was
a carbon copy of the re-
corded version. The next
piece was "Tarkus" and
two huge model "Tar-
kuses" as seen on the
album cover, belching
coloured smoke, were
revealed on the stage.
Apart from these visual
aids the number was for
me their best, with Greg
Lake launching into
"Epitaph" during his
"bit", and Keith
Emerson prancing about
with his Moog ke-
board and still finding
time to play some of
"Peer Gynt". There's
little more that can be
said about the group that
hasn't been said before,
and this article's getting
quite long anyway, but
the other numbers were
"The Endless Enigma",
"Sheriff", about half of
"Pictures at an Exhibi-
tion", "Take a Pebble"
with bits of "Lucky
Man" and "Five Bridges
Suite", and as an encore
"Rondo", featuring
Keith's knife routine and
Carl Palmer's solo,
rather boring for such a
good drummer.
Wishbone Ash had
the unenviable task of
following E.L.P., and I
must admit I didn't stop
to see them. I'm sure
everyone who did was a
fan of theirs, and that
they went down well,
and my condolences go
to anyone who was in-
jured by flying tins and
bottles.
records
Alun Davies' record company have showered us
with bumph and a photograph of him should be
next to this article; handsome creature isn't he.
Definitely the type of musician girls will go wild
over at his solo concerts. So it's rather a pity
that he's Cat Steven's guitarist and only appears
live with him. It's also a pity that all the bumph
is wasted, on me at least, because I don't like this
album very much.
I won't deny that Alun Davies is an accomplished,
and dextrous guitar player, I mean Cat Stevens
wouldn't just go for yer average guitar player,
would he? The production, by Cat Stevens who
also played piano is also impeccable. But I (and
probably Joe Public) just don't get off on the
singer-songwriter album of which this is certainly

theatre
When it originally appeared at the Royal Court
over two years ago, there was wild critical praise
for "The Philanthropist" (now Mayfair). I did not
see it until very recently and, quite frankly, I was
rather disappointed. Maybe the production has,
like so many others, become distorted with the pas-
sage of time — or maybe I'm in the wrong.
The Philanthropist in the title is a University Don
who, basically, is too kind. He is an English Philo-
logist (the study of words: no, I did not know that
either), because "I have never had the critical
facility for Literature", and in his weakness, he
sleeps with a girl he does not want to and loses his
fiancee.
Christopher Hampton makes some very cogent
points in this comedy of his — and there are
some very funny lines and moments, but the prob-
lem is that the play is rather unbelievable. It is
impossible to see how Philip (the Philanthropist)
ever came to be engaged to his girl, and even
harder to see how he retains the attention of so
many people. He is so obvious in his total weakness.
But ! think I do the playwright less than justice
if I lay the blame on him. The show has been run-
ning too long, and has grown stale. It's a pity.
paperbacks
,'The grain in the holds of MV Agacucho City
is destined for a Middle East devastated by earth-
quakes. But a hi-jacking fanatic armed with the
lethal germ Antrax-B turns this errand of mercy
into potential genocide —• and the cargo into eight
thousand tons of golden death . . . ."
Brian Callison's "A Plague of Sailors" (Fontana,
30p) make Alistair MacLean's novels seem like
Gibbon's "Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire". In
a way this novel is a brave attempt at trying to
capture the drama of the present Palestinian con-
flict and although it uses present day characters
as heads of state and in some instances puts into
words and actions a lot of what the world fears
could happen in the light of the recent spate of
terrorism, I still found it superficial and at times
laughable. Laughable in the manner that the herd
led such a charmed life amongst the guns and
bombs of the Arab agents.
However, Brian Callison cannot be accused of
letting his story stand still, the action jumps from
Scotland to the States and finally to the Mediter-
ranean where most of the action is set. As with
most novels of this sort crime doesn't pay and
the terrorists get their just rewards (?). Cliche
rings upon cliche in a plot which appears to be a
calculated distillation of all the thrillers that have
gone before.
In "The Toxic Metals" (Pan/Ballantine, 50p),
Anthony Tucker presents a saga of tragedy and
complacency as Governments and health authori-
ties turn a blind eye to heavy metal pollution. Per-
haps quite rightly he draws our attention to these
dangers carefully pointing out in an ordinary lan-
guage how these metals act on animal and marine
life and finally the body. However, his method of
following through the history of metal poisoning
cases I quite honestly found boring.
There is probably nothing very new to be found
in this book by any science or engineering student
who has bothered to read the recent articles in the
Sunday papers. Mr. Tucker tends to spend too
long discussing the problems and too little time
the solutions . . . . Oh well, the same old problem!
