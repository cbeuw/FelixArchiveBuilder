Winks commit suicide
on recycled bubbiepm
Saturday morning saw the start of the an-
nual tiddlywinks race in aid of SUK rag. The
race started the season of foolish events that
are planned to follow. To those not used to
ragging, a tiddlywinks race may seem to be
rather tame. Well, maybe so under normal
circumstances. But SUK are a little more
bloody-minded than your average tiddly-
winker. So they hold their race down Oxford
Street at 10 a.m. on a Saturday morning.
The FELIX reporter, not having the luck to live in
Hall did not get fortuitously awakened by loudhailers
outside his window at 9.45 a.m. Yet he did succeed in
arriving at Marble Arch by the appointed hour of 10.
The story continues . . .
"The first apprehensions
of being the only winker
on show were soon dissolv-
ed by the sight of at least
one hundred other idiots
(freshers being well repre-
sented) and all were in a
rather gay mood. Passers-
by at this stage seemed to
be quite unsuspecting of
the implications of such a
body of students, but when
the signal came from the
leader to cross Oxford
Street there were many
a gasp as determined wink-
ers strode forward on their
unprotected knees.
COCKROACHES
Few cockroaches were
encountered but winks
often came to a sticky end
as they rolled away down
drains and miscellaneous
gratings, or even stickier
ends on patches of used
bubble - gum. Casualty
rates were high; one re-
porter from a scene of
fit
some of the most catas-
trophic winking declared
that as many as three
winks had gone west, and
none had been recovered.
DETERMINED
Others pressed on deter-
minedly, and I witnessed
the fall of Selfridges' and
the horrors of escalator
winkfare. The CIA have
denied any responsibility.
MICK McMANUS
The police were consid-
ered marvellous: they
turned up in considerable
numbers, and lent the
occasion a distinct air of
authority. However, seri-
ous resistance was met
from a Traffic Warden re-
sembling Mick McManus's
big sister (no offence
meant) and who fiercely
brandished her mouth-
piece, exhorting the masses
to wink only on the pave-
ments.
BODIES
By this time, I got
separated from the main
body, or rather bodies, and
only some of the disabled
lurked in doorways, col-
lection tins still rotting in
their bloodied hands.
Later reports put the
money collected at ap*
proximately £345, al-
though confirmation is
awaited. No reports of
fatalities as a result of the
event have been received.
