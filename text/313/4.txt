Page 4 FELIX Tuesday, October 10, 1972
Okay. You can sit down now. Yes, go on, sit down
and relax. It's all over now. You've survived the annual
endurance test. It won't have done your heart any
good, let alone your mind, but at least the rest of the
year will be a walk-over by comparison. How much
sherry did YOU get through? Pig. I only had two
glasses all week. That was too much for me, too.
Must eat something with it next time. You had cheese
too at your reception? Some people have all the luck.
Couldn't you sleep either? Ah well. At least I didn't
suffer from constipation and air-sickness like every-
body else. You did? I'm not surprised. Surprised that
you didn't get Yellow Fever as well. Oh, I am sorry.
Four weeks' quarantine? Lucky you. Could do with a
rest cure myself. Not surprised that you got migraine
with a'l ihat walking around.
Did you know that I got through two pairs of shoes
listening to Tuesday's Union Meeting?
If you felt that way too about Imperial College's
Freshers' "Festival", you may be interested to know
that, according to "Redbrick", newspaper of Birming-
ham University, that the aim of such an event is "to
gently introduce the new intake to University life in
a relaxed and informal manner: to so overwhelm its
pimply charges that the absence of mum and dad and
the dog are quite forgotten". Yeah. It would seem to
succeed in overwhelming those poor people who have
come to Imperial College for the first time. It certainly
succeeds admirably in overwhelming all those who
are experiencing it once again, often for the third or
fourth time. It does, however, fail as regards the
"gentle" aspect. And the overwhelming part of it, far
from making-freshmen forget mum and dad and the
dog probably maks most of them wish that they could
run straight back to them.
Surely the aim of the Freshers' Week, though, should
be to tell "the story so far" and explain the functioning
and structure of the University and College. It should
aim to put freshmen sufficiently "in the picture" to
make the term "freshman" irrelevant by the end of
that week. Yet if you are one of the unfortunates at
whom this tournament of frenzy.was aimed, it is quite
likely ithat you are just as confused as you were at the
beginning of the week, if not more so. If you consider
that you now have a vague knowledge of the functions
and workings of the University, College or Union you
may count the reception and retention powers of your
mind as being of quite exceptional calibre.
Should you not be so fortunate, like most of us, may
1 make the earnest request that you do not either run
back home or adopt ostrich tactics. Like every other
generation of IC students has done before you, you
will have to find out as you go along. It is probably
better that way. We could have filled up our first issue
of the year with names of people and things and
what-happens-where-and-when and the like. But it
would almost certainly have confused you even more
than you already were. So we didn't.
It is worth trying to find out about the workings of
the college. It is an intriguing and unique institution.
You will never learn all that there is to know about
k. Many tales of mystery, intrigue, suspense and slander
are associated with it. Many books could be written
about it. Doubtless one day a part-work encyclopaedia
of the place will be published. Until then, you will have
to find out what you. can for yourself.
With "Felix's" help. From next week, as a service
to readers, we shall be publishing profiles of the
"Hierarchy of College Block". (College Block, fear not.
We come to help you, not to slander you). It will
take us a good number of weeks to get through. We
shall also be publishing other information about the
workings of this venerable institution
But this is getting away from Freshers' Week. It
needs reform. It needs to work. Tt can be changed. But
what to? "Felix" invites letters from both those of you
new to IC (let's stop calling you "freshers") and those
of you who are "old hands" on your views on the
subject . . . . by Friday, please, for inclusion in the
next issue.
POSTSCRIPT
Guidance, please, as to whether "Freshman" refers
to a man who is (a) unpreserved, (b) invigorating (c)
not stale, faded or soiled or (d) makes obnoxious
advances.

Let us
Sir,
It has come to my no-
tice in visiting members
of my flock in Linstead
Hall that a malignant
growth, commonly known
as the Bar Committee, is
in the process of being re-
jected by the residents. In
all such distressing cases,
the cure is painful and
difficult to watch, but is
nonetheless necessary.
The problem is basi-
cally one of money, power
and mistaken ideas, all
mixing together to pro-
duce a very virulent strain
of the disease; economic
benefits to a community
are always accepted no
matter how they are arri-
ved at; power invariably
comes to (and stays with)
those who appear to make
these benefits possible
How is it, though, that
such a situation could
exiot for so long without
change? This leads to the
concept of "unconditional
readmittance" which is a
privilege bestowed on the
favoured followers of
those who have the power.
In this way, the belief in
the invulnerability of the
clique members grows,
and in fact is (at the mo-
ment) quite justified.
Hence, we see here a
group of people who have
control over the most val-
uable privilege available
pray
within the present system:
a virtual guarantee of a
2nd year in Hall (not to
mention a 3rd year given
to the established lead-
ers). Why else would peo-
ple jump head over heels
to get elected (sorry,
Selected) to the assembly
mentioned?
At first glance, there
appears to be no hope for
the patient, but closer ex-
amination of the tumour,
shows ifhat bits are break-
ing away. A recent out-
burst by the "Linstead
Hall Newsheet" which
says it is published "for
and on behalf of the Hall
Committee" (i.e. by two
or three members of THE
GROUP) shows the
cracks beginning to ap-
pear.
Unlike certain African
politicians, they are as yet
unable to deport undesir-
able aliens and so have
resorted to fairly standard
methods of mud-slinging,
in an incredibly amateur-
ish manner.
No more need be said
therefore before 1 ask you
to join me in prayer for
this mentally ill patient
who will, we hope, re-
cover.
THE MODERATOR OF
THE CHURCH OF
SCOTLAND
Mascotry
Sir, v.
I was horrified to find
in your none-too-impres-
sive first issue of FELIX,
an article bemoaning the
decline of mascotry.
Do we really need an
enormous mirometer to
make I.C. a better place?
Have we really nothing
better to do than spend
half the year trying to
steal consitituent college
mascots?
The writer of the article
would appear to delight in
wallowing in the past,
when such an organisation
as WHO served only to
pander to the destructive
whims of a narrow clique.
Thank goodness that we
now have such worthwhile
causes as Community Ac-
tion for students to spend
their time on.
If I am wrong, and it
really takes an incompre-
hensible chant to bring
back a "Sporting Spirit"
to l.C, then these really
are Black days.
Yours faithfully,
SIR ALFRED
