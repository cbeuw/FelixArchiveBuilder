SPORTH
S p o r t at IC
Normally FELIX will offer a
c o m p r e h e n s i v e r e s u l t s
service and detailed reports
of matches played by IC
sports teams. In this first
issue of term Sports Editor
Andy Whitehead explains a
bit about sport at Imperial.
Imperial College joined the
University Athletics Union
(UAU) last year and finished up
National Champions in water
polo and volleyball, and runners-
up in six-a-side cricket.
U A U is a national union of
universities organising competit-
ions in numerous sports. In the
initial regional competition IC
competes in the South West
division. This means that all IC
teams competing will play fQur
fixtures during the Autumn term,
against other Universities i " the
South West region. The top two
teams in the regional league go
on to the National Champion-
ships.
The University of London
Union (ULU) offers a wider
range of sports than that
available at Imperial. If your
particular sport is not catered for
at IC then U L U may be able to
help. In previous years U L U has
also offered a higher standard of
sport, but now that IC has joined
U A U the standard here is at least
equivalent to that at U L U .
If you are considering playing
for U L U , remember that in many
sports you will not be able to play
for IC either because of club
policy or fixture clashes.

Recipe c f the \fleek
The British seem to be either potty or pig-ignorant about
vegetables, and usually both. Even vegetarians seem to
produce lots of dishes called 'nut cutlet' or 'vegetable hot-pot.'
Most meat eaters seem to think that half-a-packet of frozen peas
is a good enough accompaniment to the Sunday Roast.
The Indians are very good with vegetables, but there are also
some terrific European dishes. This one comes from Southern
France. Aubergines (called eggplants in the States) are in
season now. Buy them from a Greek or Indian greengrocer
where they're about half the supermarket price.
This dish tastes better with 8oz of fresh tomatoes, peeled, but
for simplicity use tinned.
Ingredients
• a 14oz can tomatoes
• 2 aubergines
• bunch of spring onions
• 2 tablespoons olive oil
• salt and pepper
FELIX Monday 1 October 1984
Method
1 Cut the stalks off the aubergines, cut in half lengthways and
scoop out the seeds and pulp.
2 Drain the juice from the tomatoes and drink with a shot of
sherry or vodka (cook's perk). Remove the coarse green stalk
and the beard from the spring onions and chop into 3 or 4
pieces.
3 Mix the aubergine pulp, tomatoes, onion and salt and
pepper and fry in 1 tablespoon of olive oil until the pulp begins
to brown.
4 S c o o p the mixture into the aubergine shells. Wrap the
bottom of the shells in foil smeared with the remaining olive oil.
5 Bake at 375 degrees fahrenheit (gas mark five) for 35
minutes.
Serves four
