SINGLES
45 rpm
In this regular column super-DJ Pete Coleman
reviews the single releases of the week from his
unrivalled position as head of IC Radio.
Adam Ant: Apollo 9
No longer a teen idol,
Adam's career is on a real
downer. However, in 'Apollo
9,' he regains some of the
energy of 'Ant Music' and 'Dog
Eat Dog.' Producer, Tony
Visconti, manages to make
meaningless lyrics and a one
line tune seem really good.
Watch out, this one is catchy.
Freddie Mercury: Love Kills
When I first heard this I had
no idea who it was. For the
first time recording outside
Queen, Freddie Mercury has
produced this for Giorgio
M o r o d e r ' s n e w a l b u m
"Metropolis." Bound to be a
hit, but would it have been if
not for Queen? I'm not so
sure.
Music From A Small Planet:
Love Sacrifice
Take an African Rhythm:
stick a disco mix on it with
plenty of synths: add steel
drums for extra flavour, and a
wailing voice. Mix them all
together and you get 'Love
Sacrifice.' Sounds awful? It is
n't. The twelve Inch especially
p r o v i d e s a n e x p l o s i v e
contrast to some of the pop
pop in the charts. Get up and
Rhumba!!
Geno Vess: Why Are You
Crying?
Derby band's debut release
is a five track twelve Inch EP,
featuring 'Why A r e Y o u
Crying.' Lacks the together
feel you get used to on
commercial records, but more
than makes up for this with a
b i t i n g Indie e d g e , a n d
excellent keyboard work from
J o h n C r o s s l e y . " S o u n d s "
describes them as a Jazz
Crossover band. Since I don't
know what that means, I'll say
this is well worth giving a
listen to.
Johny Mathis: Simple
Pretty much what we've
come to expect from Mr
Mathis. Lots of D u m D o Wah's
f r o m t h e b a c k g r o u n d
vocalists, and not a lot more to
listen for in JM's lyrics. The
press people at C B S tell me
this is the best thing for years.
Don't be fooled. If you can
stand more than two or three
listens to this, I despairof you.
Ian Page & Bop: Unity Street
This is good. Got my feet
tapping within seconds. G o o d
to see Ian enjoying his music
again instead of pratting
around with Secret Affair.
Very hummable tune; you can
be a pain to others for hours
a f t e r w a r d s if y o u k e e p
whistling it! Just try.

Hello and welcome to a new
concept in FELIXjournalismâ€”a
weekly column with items about
people and events in the Union
and in College, giving an incisive
(and often amusing) insight into
the personalities and stories
behind the news. It aims to
p r o v i d e an i n d e p e n d e n t
commentary on important
matters, to highlight some of the
major cock-ups in College, and
to ridicule those incompetent
enough to deserve it. In order not
to compromise the author, an
experienced observer of College
and Union affairs, he or she will
remain anonymous, but the
columnist can be contacted c/o
The F E L I X Office if you have
any tip-offs concerning events
you feel deserve to be related to a
wider audience.
A n illuminating insight into
the workings of the Refectories
section was offered by the
Union's takeover of the refectory
in the Union building. Shortly
after it closed for good under
College management last term
Union Officers and Victor
Mooney, College Refectory
Manager, agreed that several
items of equipment would be left
behind for use in the new snack-
bar. However, this gentlemen's
agreement was apparently not to
the liking of M r Mooney's
deputy, Martin Parsons. As soon
as Victor was off for a few days
on his yacht" at Southampton
Parsons hurridly despatched a
van to put a 'scorched earth'
policy into effect removing every
last nut and bolt from the place,
and coating the floor with half an
inch of grease in the process.
Even the sink was unplumbed
ready for removal. When Victor
returned from his holiday he had
to order that much of the
equipment be returned. Union
Officers were treated to the sight
of Parsons himself returning
items he had refused to leave in
his boss's absence. This incident
further re-inforces the belief that
whoever replaces M r Mooney on
his retirement next year it
shouldn't be Martin Parsons
Pictured above are Geno Vess, the Derby band whose debut EP 'Why are you crying' is newly
released.
