We know that as a student
you have a fixed amount of
money to live on. You need the
most efficient means of handling
your money
Of course, a Lloyds Bank
current account gives you a
cheque book. And when you
pay in yourfirstLEA or SED
grant cheque, you will get a
Cheque Card to guarantee
your cheques for payments to
the value of £50. You will also
receive a free Cashpoint card.
This lets you draw up to £100
a day (if your account can stand
it) from any of 1550 Cashpoint
machines, many on or near
college campuses. You 1
1 also get
regular statements, so you know
exactly where you stand, and
help and advice on money
problems when you need it.
While you are a full-time
student well run your current
account completelyfreeof
normal bank charges, as long as
you stay in credit.
And if you are interested
in a Deed of Covenant, we can
help with that too.
Call in and find out more -
our staff are always keen to help.
