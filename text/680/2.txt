The last College team to compete in University Challenge, pictured
above, got as far as the quarter-finals. Can this year's team do belter?
Granada T V has invited Imperial College
to take part in University Challenge.
We last took part during 1981/2 session
when the team pictured won three
consecutive rounds of the competition to
reach the quarter-finals.
The Union is now looking for four
students (undergrads or postgrads) to
represent IC. Why not try your hand at the
questions below? Dead easy, aren't
they?? All of them have been used on the
real programme. If you think you would
like to represent IC in University
Challenge, then come along to the Senior
Common Room (in the Union building)
on Monday 8 October at 1.00pm. A short
paper of typical questions has been
prepared that should take you around 30
minutes to do. This will be used as the first
step in the selection process.
The best ten or so students emerging
from this test will be invited to battle it out,
face to face, and televised by STOIC, so
that we end up with four students to make
up the team plus a fifth, travelling reserve.
