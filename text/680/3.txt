A competition to encourage
London's students to find ways
of t u r n i n g swords into
ploughshares — and possibly
even to market them— was
launched by the Greater London
Council today.
Aimed at engineering, science
and technology students, the
competition calls for ideas for
developing civil uses for military
technologies. Students sub-
mitting the most promising ideas
will be given between £200 and
£500 for their departments to
spend on equipment to enable
them to develop their projects.
The final selection will be
made next autumn. The first
prize will include £250 in cash
and the p o s s i b i l i t y o f
development and marketing
support from the Greater
London Enterprise Board-the
GLC's job creation agency.
Michael Ward, who chairs the
GLC's Industry and Employ-
ment Committee, said last week:

The Vice-Chancellor of the
University of London, Professor
Randolph Quirk, is to retire on
August 31 1985 when he will have
reached normal retirement age.
The Vice-Chancellor is academic
and administrative head of the
University.
The search for a new Vice-
Chancellor has already begun,
with the establishment of a
special Senate Committee which
will consider recommendations
from members of the University.
Those wishing to suggest a
name or names for consideration
should write by Monday 22
October to the Secretary of the
Committee, M r P Taylor, Clerk
of the Senate, Senate House,

uses makes ecomonic sense for
London. Our economy is
unhealthily dependent on the
defence industries-with over
88,000 people employed in them.
Now many of these jobs are at
risk. Over the past 20 years
defence spending has gone up by
20 per cent but at the same time
the number of jobs has gone
down by 25 per cent.
Defence jobs are threatened
by new technology, rationalis-
ation and privatisation-like the
selling of the Royal Ordance
factories in Enfield. Current
estimates say 200,000 jobs will be
lost in this country by 1987.Arms
conversion could protect the
people in these jobs and lead
companies to produce life
enhancing not life destroying
products'.
Details of the competition can
be obtained from the Greater
London Conversion Council,
South Bank House, Black Prince
Road, London SE1 7SJ, or by
telephoning 01 633 6495. Outline
submissions should be submitted
by November 30.
All four sabbatical Union
Officers were successful in their
exams this year. President Ian
Bull got a 2.1 in Mechanical
Engineering, Deputy President
Dave Parry got a 3rd in Physics
and Honorary Secretary Eric
Darbyshire got a 2.2 in Physics.
David Rowe, the F E L I X Editor,
got a 2.2 in Chemistry.
Last year's officers have all
found employment except for the
Professor Manny Lehman, until

Imperial College, was sum-

speak on reliability in software

systems.

popular suspicions that a war
could be started by computer
error.
Professor Lehman, one of
Britain's most eminent software
engineers, takes the view that a
nuclear holocaust is more likely
to occur due to computer error
rather than human intention.
New Hall
A new Hall of Residence has been
proposed by College, and plans
are being drawn up for a building
on top of the Sports Centre in
Princes Gardens. The provision
of a new building has become,
necessary because College has
been unable to find a suitable
existing building to buy. The new
Hall is expected to provided high
quality accommodation for 150
students, mainly postgraduates.
The study bedrooms may contain
toilets and showers en suite, or
flatlets may be provided.
New Chair
Professor Norman Franklin,
FRS, O B E , C B E has been
appointed to a new chair of
Nuclear Engineering in Chem
Eng. Professor Franklin was,
until recently, head of the
National Nuclear Corporation.
He has been a lecturer at Leeds
University and the Managing
Director and Chief Executive of
U K A E A .
The new chair is being jointly
funded by B N F L , U K A E A and
the CEGB. Professor Franklin is
60.
New Tutor
Dr L S Kershenbaum has been
appointed to the post of Senior
Tutor, taking over from Dr R W
Smith. He will take up his new
post for four years from October 1.

Super-messenger Jack Nutbeem
retired last week after 20 years at
Imperial College. Jack was a
familiar sight all over the
College, and was well-liked by
staff and students alike.
Mickey Davies
The former College Secretary,
M r M J (Mickey) Davies C M G ,
OBE, M A died on the 8 of July,
after a long illness. Born in South
Africa, in 1918 he was a student
in Cape Town and Oxford. After
a long and distinguished career in
Her Majesty's Overseas Civil
Service, he became College
Secretary in 1962, and steered the
College through a period of
intense development and
expansion. He was made an
H o n o r a r y Fellow on his
retirement in 1979.
Mickey Davies was a popular
and talented administrator and
his loss will be felt with regret by
his friends and colleagues at
Imperial.
He leaves a widow and three
children.
