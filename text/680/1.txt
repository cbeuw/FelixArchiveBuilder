SHOT FIRED IN COLLEGE!

as £26000 from outside the College branch of the Nat West
Bank on the morning of Monday 17 September.

delivery to the bank. The two
gunmen, one wearing what
appeared to be a policeman's
uniform, fought with the guards
as they were about to enter the
corridor leading from the rear of
the Sherfield building to the
bank.
A shot was fired by one of the
gunmen who then made off with
the cash. One of the guards gave
chase while the other alerted
bank officials who phoned for
the police.
The gunmen split up after the
shot was fired. One ran around
the back of the Lyon Playfair
Library towards 170 Queensgate
while the other ran through the
corridor in the basement of
Sherfield.
A student eye-witness who was
on the Walkway at the time of the
incident also gave chase. He ran
through the Huxley Building,
hoping to intercept the robbers in
Queensgate. They had already
made their get-a-way, however,
possibly by means of a waiting
car.
The robbers were described as
1) white, apparent age 40/42,
stocky build, 5'11/6', black hair,
straight moustache, dressed as a
policeman. 2) white, apparent
age 30/35, dark clothing, white
crash helmet.
Anyone who saw either of the
two men above, or who saw
anything suspicious, should
contact Chief Security Officer,
Geoffrey Reeves.
The crime-rate at College is
falling, according to a recent
report by the local police.
Only 66 bicycles were stolen
from within • the College last
session, a drop from 102 in 1982-
83. Local police see this as
vindication of their cycle coding
policy, where owners have their
postcode and house number
stamped on their bicycle frame.
Many people are unable to give
the frame number of a bike after
it is stolen, so the coding gives an
easily remembered number.
Free cycle coding sessions will
be held this year on the ground
floor of the Sherfield Building
throughout the first week of
term, from 9.00am to 5.00pm
(Tuesday 12 noon to 5.00pm).
The new policeman for the
College, PC Andy Bennie, can be
contacted through the Union
Office, the Security Office, or by
phone at Gerald Road Police
Station on 434 6533.

Micro computers worth around
£8,000 have been stolen from the
College during the summer
vacation.
A total of ten machines, all
either BBCs or Apples, have been
reported stolen, mainly from the
C h e m i c a l Engineering and
Aeronautics Building.
'The first theft occured in late
July when three micros were
stolen',said M r J Boroughs,
Security Officer.
'Five more went during
A u g u s t , and two d u r i n g
September.'
Most of the missing micros
were situated in laboratories. It is
thought by administrators in the
building that the thefts occured
either soon after 5.30pm or in the
early hours of the morning.
The number of thefts, and the
apparent ease with which they
were executed, highlights the
problems with security on the
campus. The whole question is
currently under revision by
senior College officials. One
course open to them is to secure
high-risk areas with a new,
improved 'Assa' lock that has
recently come on the market.

Norman Jardine, the new Union Catering Manager, was confident last
week that the Union Snack Bar would open today, on schedule.
The small refectory in the Union Building was run by the College until
the Union's successful take-over bid in August this year.
The snack bar, open from 10.00am to 3.00pm, plans to sell a selction of
cold and hot food including salads, pies, quiches, filled sandwiches, soup,
and deserts such as cheesecake and gateaux. This is in contrast to the
traditional 'meat and two veg' meal available from the College
refectories.
The snack-bar will also provide cold drinks and freshly-filtered coffee.
M r Jardine, pictured left, was appointed by the Union on September 1
to establish the new snack-bar. He comes to Imperial College after doing
a post-graduate catering course at Sunderland Polytechnic.
