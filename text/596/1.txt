O n T h u r s d a y the College branch of the A S T M S passed a resolution supporting
a national directive with regard to redundancies. T h e y feel that it has become
obvious that the current cuts in Government expenditure, coupled with the
internal priorities of the Rector, will result in m a n y redundancies next year and
subsequent industrial action on their par*. They hope to be joined bv the
College A C T , N A L G O , and N U P E members on a rally and lobby next
Wednesday afternoon. A n y students wishing to j o i n them will be welcome.
F u r t h e r information on the meeting at College next Wednesday will be
advertised soon.
