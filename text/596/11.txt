I C l a c e d W i l l e s d e n i n t h e i r s e c o n d
consecutive home match and immediately
c a r r i e d o n w h e r e they h a d left off the
previous week. In a very short time a 13-4
lead had been built up. Unfortunately Peter
R o n g e i n j u r e d a n a n k l e p r e v e n t i n g h i m
taking any further part in the game. After the
substitution I C went on to finish oil the first
set 15-4. In the second set the absence olTC's
centre smasher became apparent as they
s t r u g g l e d to reorganise themselves. T h i s
resulted in the set being the closest of the
match, the score 15-9 to Imperial. In the final
set Imperial showed a marked improvement
to win comfortably 15-4. T h e most notable
aspect of this set was Peter Walker winning
ten consecutive points on his service. In the
e n d the s c o r e l i n e was p r o b a b l y m o r e
impressive than the performance merited and
the fact that I C were never in any trouble
was mainly due to the disorganisation of the
opposition.

mastering the score sheet and Silvana for the
photography.

O n Saturday, with weather to order, a
happy band set out for Guildford and the
Stag H i l l Relay. T e a m selection was very
tricky but was solved by combining the mens
and womens teams, leaving the crippled Pete
Holdsworth as team photographer.
Russell Weston made a valiant elfort on
the first leg against stiff opposition. Robert
Morrison ran a good leg to pave the way for
Caroline W a l t o n to make her debut for I C .
D a v e B a r r e t t g a i n e d a few places, this
position was maintained by J o n Frost and
K e l v i n Acford who brought the team home
in the middle of the field.

Dear M u m m y (and Daddy...whoever he
may be), I a m still alive (my rash has gone).
H a s the cat recovered from e a t i n g the
budgie? F r o m your loving son, Bogey-Rolla.
PS: I've just remembered, I saw this game
today, the strips were lovely, fleeced lined for
Phil Niccolls (seems like a nice boy!). The
blues beat the reds 3-2 with Rickard scoring a
hat-trick for I C . Phil kept passing to the lovely
red shirts, pity he had a blue one on. K e v
passed to G r a h a m with the efficiency of
A r n o l d Palmer with a sand iron, and he
scored. T h e n it was half-time, but I didn't
get a piece of orange again.
The reds scored two goals. It looked like
curtains, but it was just the pretty kits. T h e n
R i c k a r d scored and scored again. The blues
were smiling, well it could have been the sun
on their super-sheen shirts. T h e n the nice
referee blew his whistle (shiney, not plastic).
P P S : C a n you make me some nice pom-
poms for my socks? By the way the team was
the same as usual, but different.
Seconds
A well-turned out (thanks Dave) I C team
started with an unfair advantage as C a p t a i n
R o n Wiggins had to referee, thus reducing I C
to ten men and eliminating our midfield
weakness. I C got off to a good start when J i m
Beer a n d A n d y H a r t l a n d c o m b i n e d to
scramble the ball over the line following a
corner. W i t h M a r t i n Armstrong marking the
entire L S E midfield, I C went further ahead
with a well-taken Hartland goal. L S E then
replied with a goal that was only twenty
yards offside (thanks Ron).
The second half started with I C under
tremendous pressure but the defence held out
and a break down the left led to yet another
tap-in (sorry J i m , brilliant goal) from J . Beer
Esq. This was quickly followed by the goal of
the season from A n d y H a r t l a n d who made
a m e n d s l o r m i s s i n g ten o p e n goals o n
Wednesday by smashing the ball in from
wide on the right. T h e previously unbeaten
L S E side were by now somewhat demoralised
and Dick Veenman took lull advantage to
add two more goals and make the final score
6-1.

Things looked ominous lor I C away to Kings
College Hospital Thirds. O n l y ten players
turned up and K i n g s took the lead after two
minutes.
However the tide soon turned when new
boy W i l l Faull didn't on three occasions and
c o m p l e t e d his h a t - t r i c k i n s i d e tw:
enty
minutes; his first and third goals being of the
highest quality. Unfortunately two defensive
errors allowed Kings to equalize before half-
time.
M i d w a y through the second half K i n g s
s c o r e d a g a i n a n d t h e n lost a p l a y e r
themselves through injury.
Finally with about three minutes left T o m
Donovan received the ball eighteen yards
from the K i n g s goal and after what seemed
an age released it to Pete Fishwick who
performed the honours and secured another
late draw with a line shot to the net.

This match being a friendly, the C a p t a i n
decided to experiment with a few positional
changes. A f t e r s e t t l i n g d o w n , the t e a m
completed well, and Sonning were a bit
fortunate to.take the lead midway through
the first half.
A f t e r the i n t e r v a l , we i n c r e a s e d the
pressure on the o p p o s i t i o n keeper, a n d
eventually gained a derved equaliser scored
by Rao.
Thanks go to Phil Webb for umpiring.

Seconds
A tremendous performance by the Seconds
who, despite being forced to play with only
nine men, totally outplayed a strong Sonning
team. O u r workrate was never matched by
Sonning and it paid dividends early in the
game when one of G o r d o n Wylies many
fine runs brought a short corner.
A n d y Whitehead brought all his defensive
skills to bear in striking the corner; executing
a clean stop and then making a total cock-up
of the shot! The ball trickled forward to M i k e
Pitkethley who chipped it past the goalkeeper
for T i m M i t c h e l l to sweep home. Sonning
then tried to lilt themselves and finally got a
goal from a long corner when our lack of
numbers told against us.
At half-time the Sonning captain offered to
let us have one of their players, to which we
were tempted to reply that he could have one
of ours! This attitude was firmly vindicated
in the second half as we continued to put the
opposition under pressure. T h e winner came
t h r o u g h A n d y S t r o o m e r w h o , h a v i n g
convinced the goalkeeper that he had totally
lost control, finally managed to score from
the narrowest of angles.
The defence hung on superbly to give us a
deserved v i c t o r y w h i c h was enjoyed by
everyone (even Sonning!).

Thirds
IC would have won this game but for a lew
problems. These problems arose in the last
quarter of the game consisting of three goals
scored by the opposition. Despite the fact
that three goals were conceded the defence
played well with Chris and Steve holding the
attack well and then supporting our own
attack with some good passes. The first goal
was unfortunate as it was scored when the
ball was thought to have been cleared. The
other two goals came as I C pushed forward
through the midfield with some good play by
Brian, trying to get the draw we deserved.
T h e f r o n t l i n e of T i m , M a r t i n a n d E d
created some good chances but were unable
to convert them into goals. Over a few jars
(40p a pint) after the game it was decided
that we all played well and there was much
c o m p l e m e n t i n g a n d p r a i s i n g by the I C
Thirds sell-appreciation group.
M a n y thanks to A n d y Purdy, who is still
injured, for doing a good job as umpire.
