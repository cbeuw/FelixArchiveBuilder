Rag Week is upon us, Centenary Fortnight is
rapidly a p p r o a c h i n g , and R C S U is disin-
tegrating into a state of utter chaos. But we're
still organised enough to bring you the winning
raft in the Raft Race on Sunday morning,
provided enough of you turn up on Saturday
to help with construction, in the Office, and on
Sunday at 9:30 in Princes Gdns to cheer us on
and to help carry the raft.
The Smoking Concert on Nov 19 promises
to be the best yet, judging by the entries so far,
and just wait for the spiffing exec sketch.
O n Sunday, Nov 22, there is to be a football
match in Hyde Park, us versus Guilds, up to
300 per side. This should be pretty entertaining
so please come along. Finally, the results of the
Raffle were as follows: 1st Linda Burry, M2;
2nd Andrew Layton, Phys 2; 3rd Frances
Williams, LS2.
Don't forget to buy your ball tickets as soon
as p o s s i b l e , a n d I h o p e y o u a l l e n j o y
yourselves.

Once a year the Royal School of Mines opens
its doors to sixth form students and staff.
Funded by industry, the Open Day strives to
bring about an awareness of the opportunities
in mineral exploitation industries and by
holding exhibitions by industry at R S M ,
cultivate an interest in the Royal School and
Imperial College.
The event is organised by student academic
societies from the three departments within
R S M : M i n i n g a n d M i n e r a l T e c h n o l o g y ,
Geology, and Metallurgy and Material Science.
O n Monday, 400 sixth formers will be shown
around the hallowed halls of learning by willing
R S M undergraduate volunteers (bribed by
cancelled lectures free food and beer at the
end). O n view will be 'what R S M can offer to
you' stands amongst 'look what our company
does with THIS!' exhibitions.
