Rag M a g
I personally couldn't give two hoots about
what happens to the Rag Mag now. I can see
that it might have caused offence and as a
majority of people agree to banning it, then
that's fair enough. I trust now that efforts will
be doubled by those who voted to ban it to
recoup the lost money.
However, I doubt that this will happen. The
people who turned out en masse to vote
seemed to be the religious groups in College. I
doubt whether many of these people will
bother putting in extra time to collect money.
This brings me on to the two things which
have really annoyed me over the whole affair.
Firstly, the Chaplaincy have deliberately
disobeyed the Council motion (restricting
sales of the magazine to IC students) by
sending it out to several charities, such as
L e p r a (the British L e p r o s y A s s o c i a t i o n ) .
What's the point in banning it to preserve the
so-called "good name" of Imperial College
when the Chaplaincy have done their best to
spread the word all over the country? These
self-righteous prats should have waited until
after the U G M before trying to apply external
pressures, if it was at all necessary. However
they jumped the gun and have caused much of
the damage they claim they were trying to
prevent.
Secondly, the proposer of the amended
motion to ban the Rag Mag, Stephen Goulder
said "I worked in a pathology lab over the
summer, which was next to a spastics home. I
certainly don't find spastic jokes funny."
What he failed to mention was the reason
for his credit in the magazine. His contribution:
How does a burns victim pick his nose?
Out of a catalogue.
He failed to mention that on the other side of
the pathology lab was a burns unit. Do I smell a
hypocrite?
The highlight of Rag Week at Primelia College
is the celebrated dwile flonking competition. In
each round, each of two contestants tries to
flonk the other's dwile before his o w n is
flonked. A s soon as the judge decides that
there has been a valid flonking, the loser retires
and the winner stays on to meet a newcomer in
a new round. The entire process is repeated
over and over until seventeen rounds have
been fought.
This year there were seven contestants,
none of whom ever played as many as three
consecutive rounds. Crumble, the reigning
champion, suffered the humiliation of being the
first of all the competitors to have his dwile
flonked, although to his credit, he didn't lose a
round thereafter.

L i n k s C u p
I received the following letter from some of
the College members of the Links Club.
Dear Mark
T h e Links' C u p was taken from the Union
Bar last Thursday evening and a forfeit trail has
been set for its return. The C u p is not a violate
mascot, it is simply a Club possession. If we
were to comply with the demands of those who
have the C u p , this would set a precedent that
any grudge against a club or society could be
settled by stealing possessions of that club or
society and demanding such forfeits. For this
reason we must decline the Treasure Trail and
ask those who have taken the C u p to arrange
for its return. W e invite those who criticise the
Club to express their views in the pages of
FELIX, but beg that they consider the many
members no longer at College who value the
C u p greatly and against whom they can surely
hold no personal grudge.
Yours sincerely
The College members of the Links Club.
P e n t h o u s e Flat
Very soon after I started asking questions
a b o u t the e m p t y p e n t h o u s flats a b o v e
Southside (which were formerly occuppied by
two wardens) the miraculous decision was
made to rent them out from January.
However, this means that a term's rent has
already been lost (amounting to over £2,000)
for no good reason. Why weren't the flats
ready for use in O c t o b e r ? It seems that
Falmouth/Keogh Warden Dr Paul Jowitt is
being particularly greedy in demanding a
bigger flat, supposedly because of his family
(but, more likely I think, because he wants a
flat as big as Dr Hutchinson's, the Tizard/
Selkirk Warden). Not only this, but his new flat
must be redecorated before he moves in, so he
is effectively holding on to two penthouse flats.
Again it seems that nobody took a decision
until embarrassing questions were asked. This
must be true, because the final decision on
r e n t i n g out the flats was left until last
Wednesday. Would someone care to explain
why?
C r e d i t s
A n awful lot of my time has been saved by the
aid of the following: Lesley, Martin, Christine,
Peter, Paul, Eddie, Shams, Caroline, Jes.
I must lastly point out that Dave Wetzel, the
G L C Transport spokesman (who is partly
responsible for the Fare's Fair scheme) will be
at College on Tuesday.
and one with Crumble. Eager flonked the
dwiles of Fumble and Grumble.
Now if you count up, you will see that I've
named the two contestants in sixteen of the
rounds. The missing round (which may have
involved contestants who had met on another
occasion) was played between whom?

Last Week's Solution
61181 which, by an astounding coincidence, is
the date on which the puzzle was set. Chris
Brannick, Maths 1, can collect his fiver on
Monday afternoon.
Last week's hero, Weatherspoon, is based
on a character in a children's puppet series
which was shown on television when I was
about eight years old. ' featured a jolly
king/duke, a snooty queen/duchess with an
equally snooty pet dragon called Pongo, and in
the cat-infested basement of their home lived a
doddery mad scientist called Weatherspoon.
Can anyone remember more about the series
(e.g. its title)? I'd love to be reminded.
