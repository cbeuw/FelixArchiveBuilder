UGM: FELIX Comment
At the UGM last Tuesday two important issues
concerning ICU were discussed, namely whether ICU
should re-affiliate to the NUS and also whether the
controversial Rag Mag should go on sale.
A s for the R a g M a g , a very active discussion took place
c o n c e r n i n g the c o n t e n t s o f this U n i o n p u b l i c a t i o n . A n d y
R u s h t o n ( G u i l d s President) d e l i v e r e d a w e l l r e c e i v e d statement
o n the subject, s t a t i n g that there was no p o i n t i n p r o d u c i n g a
m a g a z i n e p r i m a r i l y designed at c o l l e c t i n g m o n e y for d i s a b l e d
p e o p l e w h e n that very same m a g a z i n e 'took the piss out of t h e m ' .
It was v e r y clear that M r R u s h t o n h a d c a p t u r e d the c r u x of the
issue since the e n s u i n g vote was i n f a v o u r of s t o p p i n g the sale of
the M a g .
A s for the q u e s t i o n of I C U ' s status w i t h respect to the N U S , a
debate took place i n w h i c h N i c k M o r t o n o p p o s e d the m o t i o n of
j o i n i n g a n d a s o m e w h a t feeble speaker spoke i n favour.
It was evident that the consensus of o p i n i o n i n the a u d i e n c e
was o n N i c k ' s side. H e was v e r y clear to p o i n t out that the
e x t r a c t i o n of m o n e y f r o m o t h e r areas of the U n i o n ' s activities
n a m e l y , clubs a n d societies, as w e l l as the S t u d e n t Services was
c e r t a i n l y a price that I C U was not p r e p a r e d to p a y for j o i n i n g a
" l a r g e l y ineffectual o r g a n i s a t i o n " . I n this respect F E L I X stands
w i t h N i c k i n that we c a n n o t give a n y k i n d of s u p p o r t for mpves
t o w a r d s a r e a f l i l i a t i o n of I C U w i t h N U S .
H a v i n g said this-we w o u l d also like to p o i n t out that we are
c e r t a i n l y not impressed at the w a y the N U S issue was discussed.
It is recognised that M r A a r o n o v i t c h d i d not c o m e to speak
o n the m o t i o n (and also that he is a C o m m i e ) . H o w e v e r it was
d e f i n i t e l y q u i t e r u d e o f t h e m e e t i n g n o t to a l l o w M r
A a r o n o v i t c h to speak before the m o t i o n . I n fact, he s h o u l d have
been a l l o w e d to i n f o r m the a u d i e n c e a b o u t the activities of the
N U S , w h a t it stands for, etc., before the m o t i o n c o n c e r n i n g the
p r o p o s e d r e f e r e n d u m . W e also believe that N i c k ( A c t i o n M a n )
M o r t o n s h o u l d have spoken out strongly i n f a v o u r of l e t t i n g
A a r o n o v i t c h speak his case at the a p p r o p r i a t e time.
w o u l d not seem to be w h a t it
is a c t u a l l y u s e d f o r i f t h e
p e o p l e w h o r e g u l a r l y enter it
are a n y t h i n g to go by.
F o r the past few m o n t h s
those m e m b e r s of the refectory
staff w h o have been seen u s i n g
the flat h a v e n o r m a l l y been
a c c o m p a n i e d b y a n a r r a y of
y o u n g ladies. It seems that the
flat is m o r e of a " k n o c k i n g
s h o p " used, p r e s u m a b l y , to
a v o i d wives a n d g i r l f r i e n d s
r a t h e r t h a n because of u n -
sociable hours.
I n d e e d , at the e n d of the
s u m m e r h o l i d a y w h e n the flat
was g e n u i n e l y r e q u i r e d b y a
t e m p o r a r y w o r k e r i n t h e
refectory, it was r e v e a l e d that
D o m e s t i c S e c r e t a r y , C a p t a i n
L i n d l e y h a d the key a n d the
flat was not a v a i l a b l e . C a p t a i n
L i n d l e y c a n h a r d l y be des-
c r i b e d as " r e f e c t o r y s t a l l " a n d
c e r t a i n l y is not r e q u i r e d to
w o r k u n s o c i a b l e hours.
T h e fact r e m a i n s that there
are two flats i n the U n i o n
B u i l d i n g w h i c h r e m a i n e m p t y
f o r l o n g p e r i o d s a n d h a v e
d u b i o u s u s a g e a t p r e s e n t .
T h e y c o u l d ( a n d should) be
used for a better p u r p o s e or at
least r e d e c o r a t e d a n d used for
their stated purpose. S u r e l y
the C o l l e g e s h o u l d not p r o v i d e
"free hotel r o o m " for " n e e d y "
couples?
