An American Werewolf in London Cert X

Naughton, Griffin Dunne and Jenny
Agutter. Now showing at the Odeon

hitchhikers, brave the moors of Northern
England on the first step of their European
tour, but are attacked by a savage animal
under the full moon. Jack is killed and David
wakes up three weeks later in a London
hospital. He is visited by the undead spirit of
his friend who tells David that he will become a
werewolf in two days time and must kill himself
in order to release the undead from limbo and
prevent further deaths.
N o w all this may sound fairly ridiculous and
that is what director John Landis exploits to
create a unique and horrific "comedy" film.
Being visited by a wise-cracking corpse is
enough to make you think you've lost your
marbles, but turn into a werewolf and eat
people? Never.
What follows is one of the most unusual and
technically sound films of recent years. The big
treat is, of c o u r s e , the t r a n s f o r m a t i o n
sequence. This was pre-empted a little in The
Howling (which Landis admitted "pissed me
off" and "stole our thunder") but Landis' film is
in a completely different class, using the
transformation as part of and not just the
climax of action. Full credit must go to Rick
Baker for an amazing two minute sequence in
w h i c h bone and skin are s t r e t c h e d and
snapped as David becomes a werewolf before
your eyes. There are only mechanical effects
A big hand for David Kessler, or more appropriately for director John Landis and Rick
Baker (who created some extraordinary make-up and effects). The film was first shown
at the London Film Festival and premiered on Wednesday... .under the full moon.
(not special opticals) which are particularly
impressive when David's hand elongates to a
paw and a snout bursts forward and sprouts
fangs.
A d m i t t e d the film has its f a u l t s : the
completed werewolf runs around on all fours in
a most unconvincing manner (the upright
giants in The Howling being more impressive)
and for a wolfman movie which avoids all of the
normal cliches, it is sad that the ending is so
appallingly predictable.
Nevertheless, I cannot remember a film
which actually scared me and made me laugh,
occasionally at the same time. O h yes, and
wait around for the final credits as there are a
few funny lines there too. (Any resemblance to
any characters living, dead or undead )
One for all you old-time horror buffs (as well
as Animal House fans) but n o t for the

The concept of silicon narcissm embraced
without question or contradiction. The films
plural plot, structured about twentieth century
technology, offers the o p p o r t u n i t y for an
exploration of individual relationships within a
society under stress. Instead the vestige of a
promising story crumbles into a monogamous
mish-mash. The only real hero to emerge
from this film is the c o r p o r a t e individual
c e l e b r a t i n g his i s o l a t i o n in a n act of
ignominious masturbation. This is glory.
T h e films staccatto, m i n i m a l , o p e n i n g
scenes, that promise much that is not fulfilled,
are b o u n d together by the d i s e m b o d i e d
sensuallity of 'Electra' whose voice alone is
enough to cause the virginal 'Warlock' to
ejaculate amidst his soft focus, soft music
fantasies. The twist is that Electra herself is
frustrated by her jumbled affairs with Blaine
and Dean, two brothers who represent the
acceptable opposites of behaviour. Blaine, the
rebel down to his open shirt, is eventually
given the civic seal of approval for rescuing a
hapless lorry driver, Chrome Angel, while
Dean is the coach on a school team who
competes for the prettiest prize but loses her
to Blaine whom he finally forgives from the
entrenched safety of an American nuclear
family.
In fact all the conflicts are eventually
r e s o l v e d w i t h i n a m a n i f e s t a t i o n of the
American dream. Even Chrome Angel, who is
discovered to be a bigamist, does not cross the
bounds of male sexuality within the family and
i n s t e a d p r a c t i c e s a f o r m of d u p l i c a t e
monogamy while the technical and physical
separation of Blaine and Electra is deified by a
C B wedding ceremony. N o contact, no illusion
disturbed. Y o u are left with the impression
that Electra is closer to Warlock and his lonely
masturbation than to her future husband.
However, once she is married she is of no
more interest to any other character and even
Warlock is seen disappearing after the doyen
of female sexuality, a prostitute named Debbie
and the one woman in this film who is allowed,
to some extent, to express herself without a
man. but even she has a pseudo-husband in
Chrome Angel, who flaunts the decayed ethos
nl male promiscuity.
The promise of this film, however, apart
from the schizophrenic interest generated by
each character having two names, a normal
and a CB handle, is lost in a vapid re-
enactment of ethics given wheels and the
anger in loneliness of the characters and the
d i c h o t o m y of a dual plot are never fully
exploited.
