After half a d o z e n i n t r o d u c t o r y talks on
transcendtal meditation held so far this term at
College, a lot of people have had the chance to
l e a r n t h i s e f f o r t l e s s , p r a c t i c a l m e n t a l
technique.
A few years back there were more than 300
meditators at IC. It would be great to see that
number again, because not only does T M
rapidly bring many benefits to those who
practice it, but people for whom it is so natural
and effortless to be constantly happly and
lively surely have a positive and uplifting effect
on everyone around them.
So if you'd like to find out more about T M
contact Ric Morgan (Physics 2) or Oliver
Kleyn (Chem Eng P G , int 3818). Introductory
talks are held every Monday at 8:00pm in
Kensington Library, Campden Hill Road (off
Ken High St).
And finally, for those who have just learnt
and for all the other meditators at College,
there will be a meeting at 5:30pm in Huxley
411 on Monday, November 16.
See you there.

London Transport's new fares scheme which
came into operation six weeks ago cost £70m.
A further £50m was used to write off London
T r a n s p o r t ' s deficit. T h e G o v e r n m e n t has
withheld £96m in grants from the Greater
London Council bringing the total cost of the
25% cut in fares to £216m.
The Labour controlled G L C claims that fare
cuts will save the average Londoner £1.50 a
week. However the scheme has met with:
fierce c r i t i c i s m f r o m the C o n s e r v a t i v e
O p p o s i t i o n , ratepayers' associations and
business.
Councillor Harold Mote, G L C Opposition
Transport spokesman claimed: "This fair fares
deal of Labour's is a total disaster". Tory
controlled Bromley Council are trying to have
the fare scheme declared illegal by the Court
of Appeal. A right wing pressure group, Aims
of Industry, has launched a £300,000 'Hit
Livingstone' appeal. Its director claimed that
" M r Livingstone and his supporters are
persistently breaking the law".
W h e r e d o e s all this leave the G L C ?
Councillor Dave Wetzel, the left-wing G L C
Transport spokesman responsible for London
Transport's new scheme, will be speaking at
Imperial on Tuesday, November 17 at 1:00pm
in Maths 341. All members of the College are
invited to c o m e to this meeting and ask
questions about G L C policies.

Baha'i
" T o promote the spiritual, educational and
humanitarian teachings of human brother-
hood."
The new Baha'i House of Worship being built
in Delhi, India, will comprise numerous shells
containing nine sides and imitate an opening
lotus flower, as shown in the picture. The lotus
will blossom over Delhi rising some 35m above
the streets, with the outermost leaves turned
through 180 degrees to cover nine glazed
entrances. Towering above will be two layers
of concrete leaves enclosing a large circular
gathering place.
It will stands as a Symbol of Unity for people
of all religions and will have its doors open to
all peoples of all races. Within its walls only the
human voice, will be raised either singing,
chanting or reading. Only selections from the
Holy Scriptures of the World's Religions will be
used and no p r e a c h i n g or administrative
activity will take place in the temple.
Although the lotus flower has no particular
religious significance for the Baha'i, it has
strong associations with Indian culture and
was chosen to dictate the building's distinctive
shape. A model of the temple was used in wind
tunnel tests at Imperial College.
