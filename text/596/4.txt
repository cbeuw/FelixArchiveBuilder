EXEC VIEWS
The response at the U G M to the demonstration on November 18 was
not exactly overwhelming. The day of action is important to show the
government that lecturers, non-academic staff and students are strongly
opposed to the cutbacks in the university sector. Please consider going
even if you were not attracted to the idea at the meeting.
The day of action was actually initiated by the Association of University
Teachers ( A U T ) . The other university trade unions and N U S decided to
join in. Staff and students are coming from all over the country. They will
be lobbying M P s and holding meetings at Westminster.
In London, the issue was specifically taken up with relation to hard hit
colleges, specifically Chelsea College. S o , all involved in London are
going to march from Chelsea to Westminster.
If you want to take part in the march and lobby simply turn up in the
Union Office at 12:30pm on Wednesday, November 18. However, it
would be a help if you gave me your name and address in advance as our
campus trade unions have a plan to organise people into constituency
groups.

Insuring a fair deal?
The seasonal epidemic of salesman in the IC Halls selling Life
Assurance is probably almost over, but for anyone who may still be
within the ten day 'cooling-off period, or has not yet been
approached, here are a few facts and comments that may effect a
cure or provide some immunity.
The main reasons put forward for taking out Life Assurance seem
to be as an investment and/or to protect any dependants. For most
students these ends may be best achieved through separate
arrangements such as a building society account plus term insurance
for life cover only (this can cost as little as £10-15per yr for £10,000
cover). For a clear analysis of the benefits and disadvantages of life
assurance, life insurance and various investment schemes try Money
Which (Sept and June 1979, available from the Haldane Library). The
magazine does not recommend any type of whole life assurance for
anyone, but finds that life assurance linked to a building society
scheme and index-linked save-as-you-earn investments are worth
considering, depending on your circumstances.
If you are approached by a salesman or seek advice from
insurance brokers, or insurance company agents, such as
accountants, solicitors and estate agents, it is worth remembering
that these people may receive a very substantial commission from
your policy, depending on the type you choose. On a whole life policy
costing £20 a month this could be £144 the first year, £72 the second
year and then £6 a year for the next 18 years, whereas on shorter-
term policies (where the tax subsidy still applies) commission may be
as low as £10.
Insurance salesman must also abide by various legal requirements
and certain codes of practice drawn up by their trade associations, at
risk at losing their agency. The most important of these is their duty
to ensure that you understand the long-term nature of such a policy
and what will happen if you stop it before the agreed term. The ten-
day cooling-off period must also be clearly indicated, in writing; this
may be done by letter after you have agreed to take on a policy which
in effect gives you longer than ten days from the original decision.
Other codes of practice require salesmen to call at a reasonable time,
or by appointment, to tell you which company or companies they
represent, and not to make unfair criticisms of other insurers.
If you have already accepted a policy which you are not happy
about and feel that you were inadequately informed by the salesman
it could still be possible to wriggle out of it without any loss of
premiums. The Student Services Office may be able to assist in this
For anyone else considering such policies: if in doubf-don't!
