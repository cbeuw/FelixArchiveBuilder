Once again I C proved its superiority in the
F i r s t D i v i s i o n by b e a t i n g Q M C Firsts,
p r o b a b l y our toughest opposition in the
Division.
O n e of our two England Y o u t h players (C.
Hufllet) was unable to play, which caused
some team pair rearrangements. However, S.
Willis was able to play and contributed
greatly to the team's win. The lirst pair
( H . K . W o n g and I. Bull) again continued
their 100% record winning all three ol their
matches, though they d i d drop a set against
the Q M C first pair—don't do it again!
T h e second pair won two out ol three,
which is a good start lor the newcomer to the
team G . Adamson.
The third pair won only one out ol three,
probably due to complacency brought by the
success of the lirst two pairs.
T h e final result was 0-3 to I C . The Mens 1
have now won the first four matches of the
season and look strong enough to win the rest
provided the team can be consistent in their
attendance (yes, Chris!).

& Rugby
Gutteridge Cup
A lethargic Imperial X V played an equally
lethargic R o y a l Holloway X V in a game
which must have bored the pants of all the
keen supporters. Considering the importance
of the game, the lack of urgency, particularly
in the backs, was worrying.
T h e forwards, especially the Iront row of
M a n z o n i , de R o h a n , always keen in the
loose, too, and Richards were in line form. As
a result the pack provided more than a fair
share of clean ball going forwards, but the
ball was invariably lost or wasted by a back
division w h i c h still hasn't learned the art of
running onto a ball.
T h e linal result was 7-0 in favour of I C , a
result which could have been much greater
had the I C "kickers" been in any sort of
form—only one kick was successful out ol
more than ten attempts. T h e only try ol the
day came from R . Downs, the right wing.

Firsts
Following a " t a c t i c a l " reshuffle of the " c r a p "
midfield, I C First X I strolled (?) to a 3-0 win
at Kings. The team were treated to an in-
d e p t h a n a l y s i s of t h e i r d e f i c i e n c i e s by
Stephen 'Gielgud' W a r d .
The first half was very/extremely/pretty
u n e x c i t i n g ( P h i l rose a n d h e a d e d the
ball/man). The one incident of note was Aled
W i l l i a m s ' d e s t r u c t i o n of the o p p o s i n g
f o r w a r d w i t h the efficiency of a P a n z a
Division, "dislocating" his shoulder in the
process. (Phil headed the ball again!) N o
one realised that our keeper had concussion,
he knew little about the second half! C a r r
and R i c k a r d scored.
fn the s e c o n d h a l f , R i c k a r d b e g a n
challenging Niccoll's domination, heading
the ball t w i c e , proving that the ball i s softer
than the head. Phil finally established his
s u p e r i o r i t y w i t h . . . . " P h i l ' s b a l l . . . . N o , it
i s n ' t ! " , as he d r i f t e d a good two yards
underneath it! Steve " W e l l he kicked me
earlier o n " W a r d practiced euthanasia on
their forward and then collected a superb
straight right from Williams.
Finally, Dean turned on a manhole cover
and squeezed it in, to prove that the net does
stop the ball....why does he always fall over?
Team: Same as usual.
Q Sailing
T h e I C t e a m were at the " H a r p " on
Saturday to sail two teams from Surrey
University.
The morning races started in very light
wind but despite this the somewhat heavier
I C team beat the Surrey ladies team in two
races.
O v e r lunch the wind strengthened and was
near ideal for team racing by the time the
lirst race against Surrey's first team was due.
Showing overall greater racing ability they
finally won being lirst, third, and fourth.
The second race also saw IC in defeat
b e i n g i n f o u r t h , filth a n d sixth places
r o u n d i n g the f i n a l m a r k a n d despite a
marvellous linal beat by Kennedy taking him
from fifth to second place. The team again
lost being second, fifth and sixth.
T e a m : Dalton, Kennedy, Mills, Redman,
Toslevin, 1 ounghusband.

Hockey
Ladies
O n Wednesday, November 4, I C Ladies
Hockey team played a league match against
Chelsea College. There were several long
corners given to I C yet they did not succeed
in scoring. Fortunately Chelsea College also
did not score and at half-time the score was
an exasperating 0-0.
I C , d e t e r m i n e d to put the b a l l past
Chelsea's goalie, kept the pressure going and
m a n a g e d to score. U n f o r t u n a t e l y the
opponents also scored and so I C had to leave
the pitch with a 1-1 draw.
M a n y thanks to Chris Tily who had the
job of umpiring for both sides.
Firsts
IC began this game with high hopes or
retaining their 100% record on Wednesdays.
It was soon apparent, however, that the team
was intent on lowering its standards to equal
those ol the opposition. Thus, despite much
territorial and possessional advantage, and
with dubious umpiring, the Firsts failed to
a n n i h i l a t e the o p p o s i t i o n . In the end a
disappointed Imperial team had to settle for
one point.
T e a m : Butler, Coaleswor/h, Riley, Franklin,
Parker, Clarke, Rao, Ayers, Bell, Bateson.
UL Mens 6-a-side
A f t e r m e e t i n g e a r l y on a c o l d S u n d a y
m o r n i n g the I C hockey six-a-side squad
headed lor Motspur Park somewhere down
the A 3 .
The competition took the form of seven
groups to play as a league the winners of each
group going through to quarter-finals. The
other colleges in our group were Bedford,
Middlesex, W y e and Guys, of whom Bedford
did not turn up, leaving only three games for
IC to play in the group. IC won their group
without conceding a goal, beating Guys 6-0,
Middlesex 2-0, and drawing with Wye 0-0.
The opposition in the quarter-final was
Goldsmiths who we beat easily 3-0, while
trying to conserve energy for the semi-final.
H a v i n g sensed the possibility of winning
the t o u r n a m e n t , the I C t e a m q u i c k l y
dispensed of Westminster in the semi-finals
by beating them 2-0.
This took us into the final against Q E C ,
the match being played immediately due to
fading light. Both teams were tired and I C
were under some initial pressure d u r i n g
which time Q E C scored, the shot being
squeezed past a defender on the line. I C then
began to use the full width of the pitch and
took command of the game, keeping the ball
in the Q E C half. The aggressive play was
rewarded by a goal from Bansal to even the
scoreline at 1-1. Although keeping Q E C
under pressure I C were unable to capitalise
and the score at the final whistle stood at 1-1.
Under the competition rules an extra period
of up to five minutes was to be played with
the first team to score being the winners. IC
resumed the game in an energetic manner
and sustained pressure on the Q E C defence
was rewarded by a well-taken goal from Bell.
Hence IC won the competition scoring a
total of fifteen goals while conceding only
one. The squad was Ayers, Riley, Coates-
worth, Clarke, Franklin, Rao, Bansal, Bell.
