CLUBS AND SOCIETIES
ICYHA Community
Another week gone and another weekend trip
away from the monotony of College. This time
we took to wheels and spent last Saturday and
Sunday cycling around the Chilterns. We
arrived in small groups during Friday evening
at Ffenly Youth Hostel close to a delightful
stretch of the Thames. O n Saturday we cycled
west and north through woods and open
hillsides along the ridge of the C h i l t e r n s .
Return to the hostel was down a five mile long
hill with very little traffic and no sharp bends.
This hilll and the flat stretch at the bottom
meant the last seven miles were covered in
twenty minutes.
O n S u n d a y we headed n o r t h io West
Wycombe along one of the many valleys in the
area. A t West Wycome we walked up a small
hill to a viewpoint and also descended into the
hillside in the old chalk workings. We then
made the mistake of following Dave Marshall
to the station at High Wycombe. His answer to
a road closed in the centre of town was to lead
us up a very long one in seven hill and then
straight down again to a point not far from
where we started.
As to the future, tonight a group is off to the
Cotswolds, in two weeks there is a trip to
Snowdonia and on the final weekend before
the b r e a k its the Y o r k s h i r e D a l e s . F o r
information about any of these come along to
our weekly meetings in S o u t h s i d e U p p e r
Lounge on Thursday, 12:30 till 2:00.
Consoc
Last Friday's visit to the House of Commons
was a success. A f t e r a quick visit to St.
S t e p h a n ' s T a v e r n the party went to the
visitors' gallery in the Commons for about an
hour. The session then finished and we met
Peter Brooke, the local M P , and then had a
guided tour of the Houses of Parliament.
A few tickets for the Anyone for Denis
theatre trip on November 24 are still available.
If you would like to go, contact Geoff K n o x c/o
C h e m Eng letter-racks, and include £3.50 (by
cheque) per ticket required.
O n Tuesday, November 17 we have our
first speaker meeting of the year: William
Whitelaw M P will be speaking about his post
as Home Secretary in Mech Eng 220 at
1:00pm. Seats are reserved for members at

Industrial
More propaganda from the "Industry is Great"
publicity machine.
Following the tremendous success of the
British Gas and Unilever talks, on Monday,
November 16, a top executive addresses a no-
doubt-packed C h e m Eng Theatre 1 on the
subject " E d u c a t i o n and I n d u s t r y — H o w it
affects you!" The action begins at 1:00pm, so
be there early to be sure of a seat!
The Amazing Arthur Anderson Business

those budding Arnold Weinstocks who are
indulging had better not forget!!
O n Friday, November 20, a posse of motor
fiends leaves at 12:45 from Beit A r c h for the
Ford Production line at Dagenham, so hurry
out of lechers! Also, if you can't go on a trip,
please cancel (Mark Skeates, DoC2) as soon
as possible so that our reserves can step in; our
Mark often rips to shreds those who turn up
late to cancel!

Amnesty
This week IC Amnesty launched its campaign
in earnest; for the release of our adopted
prisoner. M r Firiman Awadon, who has been
held without change since November 1979, in
Benin.
We wish to thank everybody who partici-
pated in the letter-signing yesterday, and we
h o p e that this will help to i m p r o v e M r
Awadon's conditions in prison.
The letter-writing was arranged to coincide
with Benin's National Day (when we hope that
the letters will arrive) and this should greatly
help to improve the chances of his release.
If you are interested in helping to secure the
release of prisoners of conscience around the
world please come to the Amnesty meeting,
every Tuesday, 5:30pm, Green Committee
Room (top floor of the Union Building).
SF Soc
All the Soc events for the rest of this term will
be on a completely different plane from last
Tuesdays film (shaggy-god story or diabolical
Ligeti as some prefer) apart from the maybe
events (the famous not yet revealed). Next on
the agenda is a live event, namely 'Super-
heroes What's M y Line?' a bona game for
people with a boffo sense of humour, last won
by A d a m Adamant. This occurs on Tuesday,
November 17 in the Green Committee Room.
Possible unconfirmed events I'm allowed to
talk about include a visit from S F author
Barrington Bayley (not a pseudonym), the man
responsible for the strangest short story I've
ever read, and a showing of Sex Pirates of the
Blood Asteroid about which more some other
time. Material wanted for N M E 3 , the world's
worst fanzine. N o — I take that back. Previous
issues have contained articles on: the bra in
SF; how to be hip in a post-street society; the
chocolate cake in S F ; and how to make a
Moebius postcard. Just imagine it! A n S F Soc
Bulletin 28 pages long! But be warned, we
won't accept any old rubbish. Just most old
rubbish (illustrations, reviews, articles, poetry,
m i n u t e s , c a r t o o n s , s e d i m e n t f r o m y o u r
subconscious smeared on a page (fiction),
apothegms, incriminating photos, music, used
safety matchboxes, etc.) 10-10 till we do it
again.

Angling
Last Thursday (Nov 5) at our regular meeting
in Southside Bar, the club committee was
formed consisting of: Chairman Dave Kelsall;
Secretary Victor Batorijs; Treasurer J o h n
Davies; Freshwater Captain Steve Edlridge;
and two auxiliary committee members Andy
Chapman and Dave Johnson. The post of Sea
Commodore remains open. We now also have
a constitution which is in the process of being
submitted. As for our next outing, this will be
on Saturday, November 14 (any enquiries ring
Dave Kelsall on int 2594) and hopefully there
will be an outing every fortnight from now on,
If you want to know more about the club come
to Southside Bar at 6:00pm any Thursday and
meet some members.
Yacht
Sixteen members, mainly beginners, travelled
down to Lymington for the IC Yacht Club's
second outing this season.
Contrary to the weather forecast of gales
and rain, S a t u r d a y p r o v i d e d surprisingly
warm, sunny weather and a 15knt following
wind. Some very energetic foredeck work
enabled the O O D 3 4 to arrive at our first
s c h e d u l e d stop — C o w e s , o n ' t h e Isle of
Wight—just before the Red Admiral 37. The
appearance of a man demanding money for
mooring combined with the fact that the pubs
had closed, prompted a quick decision to sail
immediately for Gosport, our port of call for
the night.
The evening was misspent in an elusive pub,
the name of which has been washed from our
memories by Gales Best.
With the arrival of Sunday morning it was
soon apparent that the weather and both the
skippers had deteriorated. The beat back to
Lymington in 25-35knt winds and poor visibility
was very exhilarating and gave the crews of
the boats a taste of real sailing.
The next Yacht Club meeting will take place
in the Botany C o m m o n Room at 12:30pm on
Thursday.

Bookshop News
As you know, so long as there is a demand, the
Bookshop will stock most things. Often we are
guided by requests from students or tutors. As
the main request the past week has been for
ear plugs I would be grateful if the tutor
concerned could get in touch with me, so I will
have some idea as to the number of students
who will want them.
Next week Open University Press will be
exhibiting a wide range of their titles, both in
the shop and in the window.
