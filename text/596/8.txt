It appears that there's some confusion
over exactly what I write about. People
seem to think that I make up stories-not
so. Every/thing included is b a s e d o n actual
events, even if I embroider a little for
added effect. Donations still generously
received, although in-jokes and other
such rubbish will be ritually burnt.
Just good friends
Lazy Deputy President, Barney M c C a b e , has
i s s u e d a c h a l l e n g e to me to give any
d o c u m e n t a r y evidence that he lived at 1
Wharfedale St. last year. Of course, I should
have explained that Barney was not a rent
paying resident, merely a freeloading vagrant
who always slept there. The landlord, no
doubt, was unaware of the extra inhabitant.
H e claims that last year he lived in a
Streatham room in Wavertree Road: true, that
is the address which he shared with R C S U V P
Phil G r e e n s t r e e t and from where he a n d
several other people (who were actually living
in Earls Court) claimed ficitious travelling
expenses from their L E A s .
O h yes, and if there were five men claiming
to live in the Streatham room, how come it
only has one double bed? M r M c C a b e and C o
are obviously very good "friends".
Baron's Books
Baron Flowers of Queensgate in the City of
Westminster, Rector of Imperial College (Bri)
is indeed a man of the world. Why only the
other day, while browsing through his well-
laden bookshelf, I discovered a marvellous
b o o k o n s o c i a l s c i e n c e s e n t i t l e d " T h e
Professionals—An in-depth study of pros-
titutes, their lives and clients".
But on the shelf of his wife M a r y , the
effervescent first lady of IC, I found a real gem:
" H o w to Live with a Neurotic Husband". Well
there's a turn up for the books!
Flaming success
Having mentioned Lady Flowers I must
relate the story of her performance at a recent
Guilds dinner.
After the meal, some blindfolded clown or
other was performing magic tricks to amuse
the new intake and help them forget the
inevitable indigestion which grips you after one
of Victor Mooney's delightful dishes. Anyway,
he handed an envelope to her ladyship and
asked her to burn it. Lady F (obviously in a bit
of a flap havng not d o n n e d the n o r m a l
sequined leotard of a magician's assitant)
didn't do what you or I might and catch one
corner alight in the candle flame. Instead she
thrust the envelope directly above the candle,
which caught fire in the middle and burnt
rapidly outward towards her fingers. Being a
smart old coot she then dropped the flaming
mass....onto the paper tablecloth. Meanwhile
the blindfolded magician was getting a little
suspicious as he could smell burning and heard
the clattering of people beating back the
flames.
The moral of the story? Y o u may be able to
t a k e a h o r s e to w a t e r , but y o u c a n ' t
necessarily teach it new tricks.
Silly; Secretaries
It has always been a constant source of
amazement to me that secretaries are so
willing to lie about the whereabouts of their
bosses. The Editor assures me that most of
College block are either "in meetings" or "at
lunch" for ninety-five per cent of their day, if
we believe their secretaries. Particularly bad
w e r e the hags w h o w o r k for R e f e c t o r y
Manager M r Mooney and Bookings Manager
M r Schaffner, whose aim would seem to keep
their bosses as rested as possible and be very
obstructive to any callers.
Anyway a more amusing incident occurred
the other week when the Chairman of the
O r c h e s t r a telephoned the S i l w o o d Park
Warden about the annual orchestra weekend
at the field station.
"He's in a meeting" she was told at first, but
after explaining her enquiry the secretary
melted: " O h , I'll go and see if he's really at a
meeting then".
Rubber reminder
M y good friend A r n o l d S c r o t e , U n i o n
dustman and well-known socialite, passed me
the f o l l o w i n g m e m o r a n d u m f r o m N i c k
Morton's bin the other day. It is nice to see
office practice extended to debts of honour.
Quotes
"If I don't get any action on the education cuts
by Christmas, I'll resign," Nick Morton, I C U
President.
" T h i s E x e c u t i v e will take some beating,"
Barney M c C a b e , I C U Deputy President.
" A r e you taping t h i s ? " C a p t a i n L i n d l e y ,
Domestic Secretary (to F E L I X Editor).
"There are going to be some drastic changes in
the refectories before C h r i s t m a s , " N i c k
Morton at first U G M of term.
" H e was even more boring than I am," Martin
Taylor, E A O (about David Owen).
"Consoc are having a big go at IF. Trying to
stick ourselves in there," Tim Lawes, Consoc.
Broken vow
Guilds President Andy Rushton vowed not to
drink too much on the lunchtime before the
Civil Engineering Freshers' Dinner, despite the
fact that it was his initiation into the Links Club
(a sort of boozy ex patriots association).
His resolve soon broke and he began to swill
back r u m and blacks like there was no
tomorrow. Before long he leapt up on the bar
and (being 6ft 6in with the roof only 6ft above
the bar) began to lose his balance. With a
sideways fall he connected with a wooden
bench and was rushed, bleeding, to the Health
Centre.
Here he remained for three hours and could
not remember being very concerned how Dr
Addenbroke was putting in his three stitches.
He kept wanting to know whether she was
"putting the knots in properly".
Still in a state of semi-consciousness he was
t a k e n to St Stephens H o s p i t a l in the IC
ambulance and came around on the way. He
was released from hospital at 10:30am the next
day.
It would have been quite amusing to take
him along to the dinner anyway—he would
have been much quieter than usual and could
have layed, spark out on the table along with
Spanner and bolt.
