This being T H E freshers issue, I ought to and do begin
by welcoming ail the freshmen to Imperial College, and
Imperial College Union. No doubt many of you are completely
bewildered, confused and in some cases totaly naused off
by the charade that accompanies the beginning of each new
session. I hope that from this issue of F E L I X you can
derive an insight into the running of the Union, its function
and the way you can take advantage of the facilities it offers.
One of the main topics that we should and will be
focusing our attention on is the staggering increase in
Hall rents ."These two things together with the deteriorating
value of the pound have made utter nonsense of the 21.8%
increase in students' grants '.'The end result is to further
lower an already poor standard of living that students have
to a level approaching destitution.
The situation is bad enough if one receives a full grant
but recent research by NUS (National Union of Students)
has shown that only 14% of all students receive the full
grant. Some of the worst hit categories of students include
the means tested students who do not receive their parental
contribution; married students; self financing or mature
students and postgraduate students .The latter are particularly
badly done by, due to the fact that they have to be at
college for almost the full year.'
The shortsightedness which the college hierarchy have
shown on their part, leaves one absolutely cold." In my
view increasing refectory prices is a false economy and it
fails* to get down to the roots of the problems, that the
catering service at IC is now facing.
It is about time that students in this college took some
positive action to ensure that reasonable quality of food is
made available at prices they can afford.
The news of Alan Jones's illness comes as a blow to
those of us who know him well and is magnified by his
resignation from the post of S C A B (Social Cultural and
Amusements Board) chairman. He has always been a very
active and friendly person; full of ideas and has contributed
greatly to the social life of RCSU (Royal College of Science
Union) as chairman of RCSU Ents Committee, and would
have been an invaluable asset to IC Union.
I am sure all of you would join me in wishing him a
speedy recovery .
I would also like to welcome back Pete 'league, the ICU
President, on behalf of all IC students after his operation.
T o those of you who are not familiar with the production
of what you are now reading, I would like to extend an
' invitation to come air! visit us at the Freshers Fair,
tomorrow .When you will Bot only be able to join us in the
next issue but will also he «ble to buy F E L I X T-shirts and
and be able to acquire a F E L I X badge free. I look forward
to seeing you. ^

A lot of you have probably come from s m a l l towns, v i l l a g e s or
at the most a c i t y of a million inhabitants and you are used
tosecondary schools of a s i z e that in proportion to IC is like a dot
on. the map of Great Britain . S o it is only natural for you to feel
a b i t lost in this city of over 12 million and a n institution of
4600.
Teh 01 - 589 5111 ext 1048/1042/3 Inf. 2881
. Y o u c a n help to relieve this
situation by mixing with those
people who are already here
and talking advantage of such
opportunities that may arise
through functions organised
for. the beginning of the
s e s s i o n .
In the followipg paragraphs
f.'d I ike to introduce the Freshers
F a i r and a few a s p e c t s that
my job entails .
A s the name implies this
particular event is for your
benefit s o that you c a n
familiarise yourself w i t h the
choice of c l u b s and s o c i e t i e s
w h i c h are a v a i l a b l e to y o u .
However, as has happened on
most occassions of this nature
there are those people, who
r misuse it and indeed some
c l u b s and s o c i e t i e s or should
11 s a y , some of their o f f i c i a l s ,
w i l l try to use this as a means
of extorting money from y o u ,
'the poor d e f e n s e l e s s F r e s h e r ' .
So B E W A R E of those b l a c k -
sheep (after a l l , there are one
or two in every flock).
The warning having been
given I would like to point out
that a great many of the c l u b s
are very sincere and would
only like you to draw the
enjoyment from their functions
as they have done in their
membership with the c l u b .
The choice of clubs is
varied greatly and a l l the
various tastes and preferences
are catered for and I am sure
each and everyone of you w i l l
find some sort of s o c i a l ,
cultural, athletic or such other
field as may interest you in
this spectrum of over a 100
clubs and s o c i e t i e s .
Therefore, I'd a d v i c e you to
go to the F a i r , look around, try
out for a few days what the
club has to offer then if it is
your c u p of tea, join i t .
The Fair will be held between
2.00-pm and 5.30 pm tomorrow
in the Union Building.
House Committee
T h i s is a committee w h i c h
is responsible for the upkeep
of the Union B u i l d i n g . The
Deputy President (me) is the
Chairman of this committee and
as s u c h , I am responsible for
redecorating and maintaining
d i s c i p l i n e w i t h i n the Union
B u i l d i n g . I am a l s o responsible
for its security .
A massive redecoration
programme has been in progress
during the v a c a t i o n . T h i s
entailed a total redecoration cf
something approaching half of
the Union B u i l d i n g . T h i s has
c o s t a great deal of money
hence I must a s k you to take
as much cafe a s possible to
preserve its present state of
c l e a n l i n e s s s i n c e it w i l l be
seven years before such a
programme c a n be undertaken.
I would like to appeal to you
to refrain from putting posters
on the wa I Is . May I a d d , as a
note of warning, that any c l u b ,
s o c i e t y , or individual for that
matter, found guilty of this
disagreeable practice w i l l be
heavi ly penalised.
Notice boards w i l l be
provided to meet the needs of
d i s p l a y i n g posters to advertise
such events a s may require
this .
Bookings
During your stay at C o l l e g e
the need may a r i s e for you to
book a room be it for a twenty-
first birthday party, concert, a
d i s c o or e v e n lunch parties.
A l l you do is approach me or
Mrs Jen Hardy-Smith in the
Union office and we w i l l do
our best to provideyou w i t h the
necessary ty pe of room req u ired.
B y the way, there is no charge
as such for IC students.
However, a deposit is charged
w h i c h is returnable on your •
leaving the room in a reasonable
c o n d i t i o n .
I have very recently
managed to acquire the usage of
a suitable party room in the
Sherfield B u i l d i n g which w i l l
allow you to make a great deal
mere noise than if you were to
have a party in the Beit Quad
area. T o book this room you
must approach me personally
not less than ten days in
advance of the date on which
the party is to be held s o that
the necessary arrangements
can be made.
I hope your s t a y at Imperial
C o l l e g e is a happy one and
that you w i l l not hesitate to
come and see me if you
encounter any problems in
your c o l l e g e life. I look
forward to s e e i n g you a l l
throughout the coming s e s s i o n .
COPT DATE: TUESDAY 30TH BEFORE NOON.
A l l articles missing this deadline
w i l l be zapped to smithereens.
