10 JILIX
B R A M S 0 E T O U R R E P O R T
For the third year in s u c c e s s i o n the
Imperial C o l l e g e Union Dramatic Society
(known familiarly as Dramsoc) chose to
tour in the south of England during the
first two weeks of J u l y . By way of a
change from our established pattern of
plays out of copyright, we selected two
modern works — " H a n d s A c r o s s The S e a "
by Noel Coward and " T h e R e a l Inspector
H o u n d " by Tom Stoppard. The latter play
was a new presentation of part of our
December production w h i l s t the former
has never been publicly performed at IC .
So it w a s that we loaded two large
vans with enough theatrical equipment to
keep our technicians happy for a fortnight,
and enough food to keep the actors replete
for a few days; for If has been observed
by generations of Dramsoc tourists that
whereas Lymington has a n ample supply
of cheese, Branston p i c k l e and bread, the
chance of finding a P817 valve or a
c i r c u l a r gobo are remote .
Our first port of c a l l was the Lord
Mayor Treloar C o l l e g e for handicapped
boys at A l t o n . They were particularly
enthusiastic when an actor in a wheel-
chair attempted to run down a fellow
thespian. Having negotiated various one
way streets, new forest ponies and s o on
we found ourselves at Lymington. Now
c l e a r l y , if you are an ambitious yachtsman
.Lymington is the place to be, for It is
by Thomas Stevenson
delightfully situated on the Lymington
River and is convenient for the Isle of
Wight ferry. However the inhabitants are
not keen theatre goers and it was only
with a great deal of cavorting up the high
street in our costumes and purchasing
large numbers of St. J o h n ' s Ambulance
Brigade flags that we were able to get
the hall 2 0 % full, (confession - the total
capacity of the hall is only about sixty),
for the F r i d a y n tght performance. Saturday's
performance fared better as large numbers
of loyal fans motored down from London
to give us support-swelling the audience
to twenty. Perhaps next year we should
return to our earlier practice of performing
period pieces s i n c e people tend to notice
you in the market on Saturday morning if
you are dressed as a Roman centurion
whereas they think nothing of someone
wearing evening d r e s s .
Our next stop was in Beaumlnster,
Dorset. Here the only thing of note was
the remarkable midnight thunderstorm and
gale force winds .Fortunately a house was
provided for our accomodation and we had
ample time to strike our tents by the light
of the prolonged flashes of lightning.
Apart from this one night, the weather
was remarkably good though, of course,
we were not to know of the heat wave to
come.
F i n a l l y we reached Dorchester and its
Corn Exchange (where. Hardy fanatics
w i l l remember, Bathsheba Everdene saw
Sergeant Troy, whom she thought drowned).
The initial audience . response was
disappointing, despite the profusion of
posters and handbills distributed among
the l o c a l s . We were saved by the local
carnival procession which we entered and
two hectic days were spent preparing
eye-catching posters and decorations with
which to adorn our v a n . In the space of
half an hour we disposed of one thousand
hand b i l l s and the following niqht saw
them flooding in to witness our final night.
It was a pity that we marred such a
s u c c e s s f u l publicity exercise by our
natural exuberance in the final perform-
ance. Our retrun to London was without
.incident - s u p r i s i n g considering the merry-
making that had gone on the previous night
Our thanks are due to so many people
that it would be impossible to name them
a l l here. Despite the apparent hectic
nature of the tour much time was found
for drinking*, swimming, fresbeeing and
sun-worshipping.* If this sounds like your
glass of c i d e r Why not join us? Our
storeroom on the 21
/i floor of the Union
Office is open for talk and coffee until
quite late each evening . O u r . plans for
the s e s s i o n are not entirely f i n a l i s e d , s o
that you s t i l l have a chance to plan our
future.
A l t e r n a t i v e
A r t i c l e
Union, bar to open
Sunday lunchtimcs!
The Union bar w i l l , as of this
Sundays .That is the news for
male dominated bar.
Mr Brendan Clements, who
runs the bar, said he hoped to
provide food at these t i m e s .
The summer haze clears
s l o w l y and the leaves that were
green turn to brown, w h i l e my
hair, w h i c h was brown, turns to
gray as the new s e s s i o n
staggers towards us ever more
r a p i d l y .
The autumn finds me back
In the Union office, now
wearing my A A D (Academic
Affairs Officer) hat and
surrounded by the new e x e c u t i v e .
It is amusing to see the good,
the bad and the ugly watching
Jen and Pat wlnd-up the Union
machinery ready for the new
year. I have just noticed that
our dear president is at present
replaced by a cardboard cut-out
Teague w h i l e the real thing Is
apparently undergoing major
structural repairs and redeco-
rating (rumour has it that he is
having a B B C v o i c e transplant).
Enough of this gay banter, I
must get on with Academic
Affairs before my vocabulary
Is expended and I am forced to
resort to tautology -
Looking thro* my newly
acquired files I find that until
last year academic affairs
c o n s i s t e d of throwing darts at
newspaper cuttings of Lord
Murray or even further back,
Sir E r i c A s h b y - but times are
a c h a n g i n g . My predecessor
set an unfortunate precedent
by doing a lot of work and
getting A A C recognised as a
body w h i c h could be useful in
the running and structuring of
C o l lege academic l i f e .
There are two major issues
on the A A files at the moment.
The first is an attempt to combat
falling student numbers by
producing an Alternative
P r o s p e c t u s . The College
' g l o s s y ' t e l l s everyone how
many Nobel prize winners we
have as w e l l as useful informa-
tion like the number of course
units carried by the E t r u s c a n
Archeology option (very few).
It Is hoped that the Union
produced prospectus would
compliment and not compete
w i t h the official prospectus by
providing I n f o r m a t i o n on
accomodation, how to find flats
and student opinion of c o u r s e s .
T h i s might d i s p e l many of the
myths surrounding IC and
London w h i c h exist in the
minds of many prospective
s t u d e n t s .
The academic standing of
the C o l l e g e Is no longer the
sole concern of a prospective
student. The p o s s i b i l i t y of a
hall place, the s o c i a l life and
the difficulty of finding
alternative accommodation, a l l
weigh heavily on such a
student's mind. I am sure that
if we c a n provide a r e a l i s t i c
picture of life at IC this w i l l
attract people, not frighten
them off as some academic
staff seem to fear.
The second Issue concerns
the expansion and development
of associated and general
s t u d i e s . A t present most
d e p a r t m e n t s only . a l l o w
associated studies in the
third year - If then.We would
ideally, like to see a s s o c i a t e d
studies available for at l e a s t ,
a half unit per year and
timetabled to prevent c l a s h e s
with departmental courses .
T h i s would enable study of a
language as part of a degree
course for instance .
It is time many departments
realised that the sole purpose
of undergraduate teaching is not
to produce research students
and that university education
should not be entirely concerned
with self perpetuation but a l s o
w i t h an education useful to
themse Ives arid s cc lety.
Just before I fall out of the
bottom of my column, may I say
that you have academic year
representatives, a department
representative and C C U A A O
ready and w i l l i n g to help with
any problems you may have,
but please feel free to see me
