A Life
in the
Day of R C S U
by Steve Brightman, RCSU President.
Once upon a time, or yesterday to be precise, fresteer
Egbert found himself at South Kensington tube station with
two s u i t c a s e s , a budgie cage and a goldfish bowl, s t i l l
wondering why he had turned down Cambridge. He meandered
s l o w l y along a seemingly e n d l e s s , brick-built s * " h o u s e
tunnel, and after kneeing an over enthusiastic busker in the
groin, found himself confronted by a block of luxury flats
locally known as Southside.
Before he could s a y S i r
B r i a n Flowers (he is the bloke
speaking to you while you read
this), he was whisked across to
the gleaming new Union office
in W2 where he met lots of
interesting people and learnt
some of the many things that he
would be getting up to during
his three year stay at I C .
What d i d Egbert discover?
Was itthe secret of t h e U n i v e r s e ?
T o find out, come t o the
Freshers Union Meeting at
2 3 0 pm today in P h y s i c s
lecture theatre 1 . Otherwise,
drop into the Union office (along
the walkway at the Maths
department and) or come and
meet us in the Union Bar any
evening.
Having deposited his worldly
belongings in one of the rooms
he hurried round the corner to
find h i s department. Fifteen
ever-6o-borlng minutes later he
staggered out thinking " t h i s
can't be i t " .
And then. :and then (repeti-
tion for dramatic effect — failed;
in the distance he espied a
strange looking figure approach^
i n g . A s the figure drew c l o s e r , J
Egbert could see that on top of
a faded R C S T/shirt w a s . a
gown(!) and above that a t o p
hat with a mouse stuck in the
r i m . Further investigation
r e v e a l e d this to be the
president^) of the R o y a l
C o l l e g e of Science Union and
furthermore, he w a s almost
human!I (Sub-species Brightman

RAG
Rag week this year is t o be
Friday 7th Nov - Saturday 1 3 t h .
Although events have not yet
been f i n a l i s e d , we are hoping
to start the w e e k off with the
rag a n d drag Competition
Compared by " A famous national
p e r s o n a l i t y " . B a r - B - Q u e ,
S o c i a l C l u b s ' evenings ( i n c l .
Blue films), E n t s Concert,
Drunk-a-pub-dry. Morphy d a y
and s o on w i l l be occur ing
during that week and we hope
to get another"famous national
p e r s o n a l i t y " for a final rag
d i s c o .
A s 2nd and 3rd years w i l l
probably know, collections are
not usually limited to R a g
Week but continue over the
first two terms with a frequency
depending on the C C U V i c e
P r e s i d e n t s .
For once, the police in
Kensington and Scotland y a r d ,
have been really sweet ... we
can have a rag procession and
even c o l l e c t on it! S o far we
have only got one lorry for the
floats but I'm absolutely
confident that w e ' l l get offers
of thousands more (hopefully
one or two novelty vehicles
(and Jez!) w i l l be there).
T h i s year we are organising
a lottery. P r i z e s are coming in
thick and fast; ' G u i n n e s s Pots
S e t s ' , lots of beer, assorted
perfumeries from Germaine
Montell, Dorlthy Gray, C h r i s t bn
D i o r , records (Duane A l l m a n ,
Roy B u c h a n a n , A r t Tatum) and
lots of other goodies t o o .
T i c k e t s should be a v a i l a b l e
at Freshers F a i r and on
through the term until R a g
Week when the draw w i l l
probably be h e l d .
L a s t year R a g collected
£8,500. T h i s year £10.00
should be no sweat for fine
chaps like y o u . R e a l men (and
real women too please) are
needed to 'stage manage'
events, s o please come to the
R a g s t a l l on Freshers Day and
see our pretty d i s p l a y s . A l s o
come t o the first Rag meeting
(will be advertised around
college) at which there w i l l be
free beer. C udd l e s .
