Refectory
price bombshell
Any hope that IC students might have entertained about an improved standard of
living due to the new level of grant took a severe blow when at the last Governing Body
meeting of the 1974/75 session, it was announced that refectory prices were to be
increased by 40%. This increase together with the 16% increase in hall rents; 17%% for
Hamlet Gardens; not to mention the increase in the cost of books and stationery are
just a few of the increases to be met from the £155 increase over last year's grant of
£655.
The increase e s s e n t i a l l y
stems from the U G C ' s (Univer-
sity Grants Committee's)
ruling w h i c h requires that
refectories a n d h a l l s of
residence be r u n on a self-
balancing b a s i s . The size of
the increase was determined i n
view of a catering deficit of
£78,000 incurred in the f i n a n c i a l
year w h i c h ended last J u l y .
T h e o r e t i c a l l y , this increase
w i l l enable the objective of
self-balancing to be achieved
assuming there i s no decline
in the number of customers
using the refectories.
Increases opposed
Student representatives on
Governing B o d y strongly
opposed the magnitude of the
increases. In a d d i t i o n they
expressed the view that
termly reviews of refectory
prices a n d h a l l rents were
totally unacceptable unless
student grants were to be
s i m i l a r l y reviewed.
When a s k e d to comment on
the increases and the reasons
behind them the Deputy
President, R i z Shakir s a i d ,
"/ cannot foresee the
refectories enjoying the same
level of cu stom, since for the
poor quality of food, such high
prices can only be described
as unreasonable. This will
mean that a further round of
increases will be needed at
Christmas and a snowballing
effect will set in. The only
thing that can result out of this
charade, is the downfall of the
present catering system and in
process causing a lot of
hardship to students." T h i s
view i s a l s o endorsed b y the
other members of the I C U
E x e c u t i v e .
Formal dinners up 60%
T h i s i s going to h i t
particularly hard at C C U
Freshers Dinners since the
amount a l l o c a t e d to these
dinners has not increased b y
any s u b s t a n t i a l amount. T o
aggravate a n already desperate
situation, it appears that these
dinners w i l l i n fact cost up to
59% more than they did last
year. T h i s seems t o contradict
the Refectory Committee's
d e c i s i o n , on June 5th, recom-
mending to the Governing B o d y
that internal formal dinners be
subject to an increase of 40%
whereas those for outside
organisations should cost 60%
more than previously.
UGM motion
A large proportion, of a
student's grant i s spent on
food therefore this w i l l be a
matter of great concern t o them
throughout the coming s e s s i o n .
Indeed, a motion expressing
this very feeling i s being
brought to the U n i o n G e n e r a l
mee ting be ing he Id on Thursday,
2nd October i n the Great H a l l
at 1.00 p m .
President recovers- SCAB Chairman resigns
Peter Teague, the Imperial
C o l l e g e Union President, is
recovering from an operation he
underwent ten days ago. The
operation was to remove a
hernia discovered eaily last
January. Pete had been waiting
since then to go into hospital
for the operation.
He will have to take it easy
for a few weeks but this will
not however, prevent him from
delivering his speech at the
Freshers reception this
morning.
It was confirmed a few days
ago that Alan Jones, SCAB
Chairman and last year's RCS
Ents officer had contracted
glandular fever. It will be at
least six weeks before he will
be recovered enough to attend
College, In the light of this, he
has resigned his post as SCAB
Chairman .
Mo one has taken over in an
acting capacity as yet, but a
S C A B executive meeting "is
being called to appoint some-
one to this position. A new
SCAB Chairman will have to be
elected at the second Union
General Meeting of this term
along with about 30 other Union
officers . The need to elect so
many new officers arose due to
the fact that several of them
failed their exams.

Only 14 per cent of a l l full
time students receive the full
grant of £740 C h a r l e s C l a r k e ,
President of N U S , revealed
at a press conference given on
the 11 th September.
Referring to the effects of
the educational cuts he s a i d ,
The whole of the education
system is being starved of
money .Massive educa'tion cuts
are forcing all students to
accept a reduced standard of
education and excluding many
from post school education
altogether".
He urged L E A ' s to stand
firm and opposed the cuts even
at the r i s k of becoming
"educational Clay Crosses'".
The N U S would be mustering
a l l i t s strength t o fight the
cuts a n d central to tlnjit
campaign w i l l be working
with the T U C , e s p e c i a l l y at a
l o c a l l e v e l .
The N U S would a l s o seek
the cooperation of parent-
teacher associations . A lobby
of Parliament has been
organised for Tuesday, 2 1 s t
October, b y the S E region of
the T U C which they w i l l
mobilise students f o r . A l s o ,
for one week starting on the
27th October, 31 P o l y t e c h n i c s
w i l l be i n occupation a s a
protest against the cuts i n
public expenditure.
Methods of pressuring L E A ' s
included sending delegations
to meet L E A o f f i c i a l s , working
in a l l i a n c e with other pressure
groups and through the Labour
movement. There would a l s o
be direct a c t i o n involving
picketing and occupying L E A
offices .
He went o n to describe the
government's economic policy
as a n "economic philosophy
of sheer lunacy". What they
should do i s to a b o l i s h the £6
pay limit, enforce strict price
and import controls a n d
increase public expenditure.
He a l s o cast ridicule on the
v i s i t s to colleges taking place
s o o n . He saw no point in them
if no money was being given to
the colleges being v i s i t e d .
