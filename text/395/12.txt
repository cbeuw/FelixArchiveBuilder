The Rocky Horror Picture Show
A S W E E T T R A N S V E S T I T E F R O M
T R A N S E X U A L T R A N S Y L V A N N I A ; thats
how F r a n k N . Furter (TimCurry)announces
himself to an unsuspecting couple (Susan
Sarandon and Barry Bostwick) who have
arrived at his castle at the time of the
Annual TransyIvannian C o n v e n t i o n . They
witness the creation of Rocky (Peter
Hinwood), a perfect male specimen, from
a tank of refrigerated c h e m i c a l s . Then
E d d i e (Meatloaf) the victim of one of
Franks earlier experiments breaks loose
from a large refrigerator. C l a d in T shirt
and denims and astride whilst singing
the R o c k ' n ' R o l l number "What ever
happened to Saturday night", vintage
Harley Davidson he terrorizes the
Transy Ivannians.
Upset by this outburst, Frank k i l l s
him and makes good use of his carcass
the following e v e n i n g . N o , this is not a
cheap porn movie, it Is a straightforward
adaptation of the stage musical "The
Rocky Horror Show" with book, music
and lyrics written by Richard O ' B r i e n who
Incldently plays the part of Riff Raff, a
hunch back handy man, In the f i l m .
The stage play has been running since
January 1 9 7 3 , this obviously speaks w e l l
for the m u s i c . It is "50's style R o c k
played with ' 7 0 ' s techniques. The
rythyms are s i m p l e and very very c a t c h y .
One might expect the tranvestite theme to
Immediately evoke an X Certificate but
the w e l l rehearsed musical numbers and
the total Improbability of the plot reduce
F r a n k ' s sexual exploits to a strange
Innocence. Intentionally reminiscent of
Edgar Lusgarton, C h a r l e s Gray makes a
s k i l l e d narrator imitating s u c c e s s f u l l y
the somewhat pretentious style of those
' B ' movie narrators. In a lighter v e i n , his
instruction of the steps during the dance
routine "Time Warp", aided by J i m
Sharman's c r i s p direction, is little short
of hilarious.
The film obviously lacks the intimacy
and spontaneity of the stage version, but
to my mind, this is adequately compensated
by the s p e c t a c u l a r sets and more
elaborate musical backing. It is perhaps a
little Ironic however, that a stage play
that gently rpocks the cinema should end
u p a s a film .

Orson Welles, Tuesday Weld:
A Safe Place.
Modernist trends In films today
regularly fail to impress, and this film Is
no exception. It's a total pain in the
groin from beginning to e n d .
Orson Welles meanders a i m l e s s l y
through this f l i c k a s a hack magician
whose lifelong ambition is really to make
something disappear. Poor old s o d .
someone should have told h i m . H i s
relationship with Tuesday Weld is never
really put into any meaningful kind of
perspective. She's a mixed up wierdo who
persistently resorts to v i s i o n s and images
of childhood in order to bring any meaning
into her life. She has the loonle Idea
that when she was a kid she actually flew.
Into the a i r . C r a z y . Y e s , that's what I
thought.
Whoever edited the film was either a
blethering idiot or just slightly blotto
because the scenes change with such
incoherence that much of the dialogue
just becomes meaningless.
The garbage handed out by the film
distributor implies that you have to read
between the lines to make any sense out
of the f i l m . Sheesh. I prefer simply to
enjoy a film rather than risk a nervous
breakdown trying to permutate the rash of
a l l e g o r i c a l n u a n c e s w h i c h seem to destroy
this particular w h i m s i c a l piece of
c e l l u l o i d .
Roger Moore and Susannah York, the
duo from ' G o l d * star in what i s a typical ly
s i l l y B r i t i s h comedy c a l l e d That L u c k y
Touch.' Roger Moore plays the smooth
talking womanising arms dealer who s e l l s
" p r o t e c t i o n " . Susannah York is the
conscience striken reporter from .the
Washington Post.
Both are in B r u s s e l s for the N A T O
wargames for very different reasons that
involve using General Steedeman (Lee J .
Cobb), American representatives in N A T O .
The film really attempts to get going
when Micheal (armsdealer) meets J u l i a
(reporter) outside her apartment from
which -js in advertently locked out. He
doesn't get her, despite falling off the
ledge of a w indow.
The whole film Is full of missed
opportunities and its only saving grace
are the performances of L e e J Cobb and
Shelley Winters a s his peanut brained
wife.
Gene Hackman again plays the role of
" P o p e y e " Doyle in John F r a n k e n -
heimer's. direction of F r e n c h Connection
Number 2 . T h i s , the follow-up to the first
film, is completely different to the
original in character and totally outstrips
it as w e l l .
Set in the t e e m n i n g streets of
M a r s e i l l e s , it shows " P o p e y e " , with the
help of the French narcotics squad, in his
f
i n a l bid to sever the " c o n n e c t i o n " at
s o u r c e .
This Is a psychological thriller of the
first kind, with a s l o w , nail-biting
s u s p e n s e . It is a quest w h i c h in its
triumphant ending succeeds inchalleng
the glib assumptions left unanswered
the first f i l m .
Hackman's portrayal of Doyle excels
even his previous Oscar winning one and
he is most ably supported by Bernard
F r e s s o n and Fernando R a y as Charnier?
otherwise referred to as " F r o g O n e "
Definitely a film to see if vou haven't
done s o a l r e a d v . _ . _ .

George Thalben Ball Plays the Allen
Computer O r g a n at Chichester
Cathedral.
"IN A remarkably short time Allen's
Digital Computer Organ has won the
enthusiastic praise of scientists, clergy-
men, church and concert musicians the
world over." So says the album cover and
I have no reason to doubt it, but having
made extensive enquiries, admitted ly only
at the pub, I have decided that the
majority of the populace know nothing of
the wondrous machine in q u e s t i o n . In my
ignorance al) I c a n say is that, forcing
technology into music can only be
justified If it produces new musical
development. It should not just be done
as a s c i e n t i f i c exercise to prove tech-
nological omnipotence. F o r example I've
heard synthesisers used to excellent
effect but "Xour Top Ten Hits on Moog"
doesn't turn me o n .
I can now reveal that the computer
organ sounds precisely the same as any
ordinary organ and I couldn't even hear
the cards being read or the print out
spewing forth. The record c o n s i s t s of
eleven church pieces, (including works
by Roger, Stanely, and C P E Bach), and
it inspires a diversity of moods.. Indeed
this contrast of s t y l e s is what spoils the
record because it lacks continuity which
is e s p e c i a l l y important for background
music and I would guess that church
music in one's front room is rather an
esoteric taste, except in a background
context.
But perhaps I was disconcerted by the
very thought of a computer organ. W i l l
computers now start reproducing? Where
did a l l those pocket calculators come
from?
Andrew T Osborne
Yvonne Elliman - Rising Sun (RSO)
The second s o l o album by M i s s
E l l i m a n is hardly likely to w i n her more
admirers than those who got off on her
previous effort, and in fact w i l l no doubt
succeed in confusing many would-be
converts. Although almost faultless in
terms of production, (Steve Cropper),
musicianship and to a large extent
material, the album doesn't exactly
catch you by the proverbial " s h o r t and
c u r l i e s " .
The confusion a r i s e s from the fact
that this Is a complete departure from the
work she is currently engaged in (le the
rock context of E r i c C l a p t o n ' s band) and
is, in fact, s o commercial that it could
almost fall into the easy — listening
category (almost suro at times) — w h i c h is
fine I suppose, but the fact that in having
a foot in each camp as it were, she ends
upgoing nowhere fast.
People who have picked up on her
singing rock-blues as part of the ' E r i c the
C outfit, w i l l probably be disappointed
with this a l b u m . But as previously stated,
as an out and out commercial record the
album i s , w e l l , pretty good. On the whole
she has selected her s o n g s w i t h much care
and thought. The only track that comes
amiss is the bland rendition of the w e l l -
known "Walk Right In", which is in stark
contrast to the usually terse arrangements
of the other music t r a c k s . Particularly
worthy of mention is the Eagles "Best Of
My Love", Todd Rundgren's " S w e e t e r
M e m o r i e s " and the C h a r l e s / D a n k o song
"Small Town Talk", each of w h i c h are
executed to their full commercial potential.
It w i l l be interesting to hear her next
album and perhaps in so doing, find out
what fork she w i l l take from the musical
crossroads she now finds herself.
