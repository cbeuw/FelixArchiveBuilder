Three of the most important factors contributing to the inter-
pretation of one's natal chart are the positions of the Sun and
Moon (the signs and houses they occupy) and the A s c e n d a n t
which is the s i g n rising at the eastern horizon .The Sun represents
the Self or one's essence whereas the Ascendant is the image
presented to the immediate environment. The moon rules one's
emotions and inner nature as w e l l as the response, imagination
and personal h a b i t s . However, the positions of the other planets
and their aspects play just as an important role.
A person's Sun sign is a reasonable off-the-cuff guess about
his general character and t r a i t s . Anything more is a pretty rough
cuff. A n y h o w , guessing sun signs makes an interesting parlour-
game .
