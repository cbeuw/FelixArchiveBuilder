Recorded in 1972, but only now seeing
the light of day, the band comprises most
of R T F a s it then w a s , plus Tony
Williams on drums .Anyone familiar with
Corea's work at that time w i l l not need
me to tell them that a l l the tunes are
latin-based, the sort of ' c o c k t a i l jazz-
rock' he w a s preoccupied with at that
time.
A rhythm section comprising W i l l i a m s ,
Stanley C l a r k e (bass) and A i r t o Moreira
(percussion) lay down the s o l i d , inventive
foundation y o u would expect, (Clarkes
bass playing a s a l w a y s , a highlight) and
in s o doing, provide the ideal vehicle for
the Getz tenor. Corea plays with h i s
usual dexterity, never putting a finger
out of place, yet not really stretching
himself to the limits everyone knows he
is capable of. Which brings us to G e t z
himself. Well what can one say about h i s
playing that hasn't been said before?
H i s technique is a s sure and fluid a s
ever, h i s tone clear and f u l l . When he
lets loose in a latin environment probably
there's n o one more capable of inter-
preting the South American idiom, a s far
as the saxophone goes, save for perhaps
Gato B a r b i e r i , who's really a different
bag of balls anyway.
Definitely worth a listen for Getz
fans/anyone interested in C h i c k Corea's
work of a few years back.

Charles Wood's play J i n g o is some-
what confusing and shouldn't be confused
with other 'ingo's produced to date. It is
however, a good play w h i c h unfortunately
runs out of jokes about halfway through.
The play is set in Singapore during World
War II.
The confusion arises out of several
things, two of which are the bombing of
Pearl Harbour and the invasion of
Malaya by the " l i t t l e y e l l o w m e n " . T h a t ' s
how George (John Standing) refers to the
Japanese invaders. George Is a rather
frail and myopic Major who is in-fact not
really a Major but a B B C broadcaster and
is an expert on Jap's.
Gwendoline, played by Anne Massey,
Is George's wife s h o has had them a l l .
The army officer's that i s . She bumps into,
or vice versa, her ex-husband who tries
immediately to c a p i t a l i z e on the chance
meeting. However, the w a r h o t s - u p , the
B r i t i s h crumbles n o i s i l y and a wreck of a
brigadier gets in the w a y .
Despite the rather devious plot, the
play is w e l l produced with good sets and
s l i d e s of Singapore during the war. Well
worth watching out for is Peter Jeffrey's
performance a s Percy, the brigadier. The
play is a l s o liberally sprinkled with
orientals for authenticity.
