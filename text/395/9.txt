P e t e r P a t t e r
Welcome a l l you that have sojourned
to this establishment of academla in
search of knowledge, truth, and a degree .
I hope that you a l l have an enjoyable
and s u c c e s s f u l time here in this, one of
the true B a s t i o n s of s c i e n c e and
technology .
One of the problems that many of you
that are at University for the first time,
w i l l face, is to achieve the correct
balance between the time that you spend
on your academic life and s o c i a l life. A t
Imperial C o l l e g e there are over eighty
clubs and societies offering a wide range
of a c t i v i t i e s . Y o u may never have had
the chance to take-part in some of these
a c t i v i t i e s in the p a s t . I would warn you
to be careful, and s e n s i b l e . D o not
;commlt a great deal of the time which you
have to the a c t i v i t i e s of c l u b s and
s o c i e t i e s until you at least know what
demands your academic work is going to
make on y o u . It is easy to over-commit
yourself when you first get to college, I
know. I d i d . On the other hand, however,
I would urge you to take part In at least
some of the c l u b s and societies that the
Union provides. I feel that you w i l l have
definitely missed out on a very important
facet of University E d u c a t i o n , if you do
only academic work and take no part In
the s o c i a l life of IC .
We must remember however, that we
are the Union...and the Union should
be doing those things that we wish it
to do.
The Union plays a n integral part In
life at I C . We must remember however,
that we are the U n i o n . Every student here^
is automatically a member, and the U n i o n "
should be doing those things that we
w i s h It to d o . F o r the Union to do such
thhngs it Is important that y o u a l l make
feelings known. So take part in Union
General Meetings, talk to your Depart-
mental Representatives, or come to the
Union Office and talk to any of the
Officers.
. Accommodation has been causing many
people problems over the past few weeks.
Apart from the difficulties In finding
accommodation In London, there are a l s o '
those problems which c a n arise out of the
plethora of complex legislation w h i c h
covers-the accommodation field . T h e 1974
by Peter Teague, ICU President
Rent A c t , the question of licences
instead of Tenancy Agreements, a n d
Security of Tenure are a l l difficult
q u e s t i o n s . If you have any problems over
accommodation, please come t o the
Union Office and s e e either John or
myself. We w i l l give you a l l the help we
c a n . T h e same holds for other legal
problems, grants problems, in fact just
about anything.We w i l l always try to find
the s o l u t i o n s .
It is in the interests of all in College ,
to have a relatively cheap, good
quality and convenient catering
service on the campus.
Another problem of immediate concern
is that of refectory prices. T h e refectory
prices were increased by forty per cent
on September 1st in a n attempt to increase
takings by a s i m i l a r amount in order to
cover a large deficit expected in the
coming year. T h e price increase i s , of
course, driving people away from the
refectories. Instead, they are bringing
s a n d w i c h e s , or eating elsewhere. It is in
the interests of a l l in college to have a
relatively cheap, good quality and
convenient catering service on the c a m p u s .
In order to see whether or not this is
p o s s i b l e , given the constraints placed on
the refectories, I hope that the Union w i l l
set up a s m a l l Working Party t o investigate
if it were conducted correctly. T h e
question of refectories w i l l be d i s c u s s e d
at the first Union General Meeting and 1
hope that A L L of you w i l l come a l o n g .
...the government is expected to cut
another £520 million from the education
budget over the next four years.
A major feature of the coming year is
going to be the N U S Grants and C u t s
C a m p a i g n . F o l l o w i n g its policy of cutting,
P u b l i c Expenditure, as a means of
dealing with the present E c o n o m i c C r i s i s ,
the government is expected to cut
another £520 m i l l i o n from the education
budget over the next four y e a r s . T h i s
follows cuts of £465 million over the last
two years. These outs mean that next
year the expenditure on education w i l l
have only increased by 1.6% and with
inflation running at something over 2 5 %
this me.ans that in real terms the education
budget has been cut by some 2 3 % . What
effect w i l l this have?Well with the places
in Teacher Training Colleges being
halved we w i l l soon s e e a steady increase
in c l a s s s i z e s in Primary and Secondary
S c h o o l s . T h e Inner London E d u c a t i o n
Authority s a y s that it w i l l have to ' lose'
about five hundred teachers next year,
and hopes that It c a n d o this by natural
w a s t a g e . In the Higher Education sector
the effects a r e difficult to e s t i m a t e .
This means that universities are
having to begin 'freezing posts'...
U n i v e r s i t i e s usually have about 97% of
their budget committed, on salaries e t c . ,
and the room for flexibility in the budget
is very s m a l l . T h i s means that U n i v e r s i t i e s
are having to begin 'freezing p o s t s ' , that
Is, not replacing staff that leave. How
q u i c k l y this w i l l effect lecturing and
demonstrating is hard to tell .The problems
which some institutions face as a result
of these cuts are very complex. The
policy of cutting educational spending Is
very short sighted. When the economic
c r i s i s is over we w i l l need w e l l educated,
intelligent people, particularly s c i e n t i s t s
and engineers, to ensure that the economy
gets onto its feet again q u i c k l y . I hope
to be able to give you more information
about the E d u c a t i o n C u t s , and their
effects in subsequent issues of F E L I X
and in leafletsdistributed around C o l l e g e .
We c a n then decide whether or not we
want to take a n y actions against these
c u t s , and what form any possible action
could t a k e .
The policy of cutting educational
spending is very short sighted.
In c o n c l u d i n g this Peter Patter I just
want to s a y that I hope the F r e s h e r ' s
Events go off w e l l , and that we a l l have
a good year. If you have any problems, or
just want to say hello, I s h a l l be at
F r e s h e r ' s F a i r and Fresher's T e a . I hope
to s e e y o u a l l then.
Refectories Motion
IC Union Notes:
(i) The Increase in Refectory Prices of forty per cent, w h i c h
was approved by the Governing Body at its June meeting, and put
into effect on 1st September 1 975.
(ii) That this increase is severe in comparision with the
increase of twenty-two per cent in the student grant.
(iii) That Refectory Prices are now to be reviewed termly,
despite the fact that the student grant is fixed on a n annual basis.
(iv) That the price increase has not been accompanied by a n y
improvement in the quality of the food served in the refectories,
which ranges from the tolerable to the totally in-edible.
(V) That the price increase means that many local cafes and
restaurants now have comparable prices t o those in the refectories,
and food of a better q u a l i t y .
(vi) That the refectories are run on an entirely belf-balancing
finance system, although many other institutions s i m i l a r to IC
have decided that this is impossible i n a time of high inflation.
IC Union Believes:
(i) That the C o l l e g e , when accepting students, must a l s o
accept responsibility to provide reasonable food, at a price w h i c h
is consistent w i t h the student g r a n t .
(ii) That the situation in the refectories at present. Is such
that each student should s e r i o u s l y consider whether the food
offered, for the price which must be paid, makes the refectories
the best place to e a t .
IC Union Instructs:
The Executive to investigate alternative places t o e a t , both in
and around C o l l e g e , and to urge people to make use of any such
alternatives.
The Union Representatives on Refectory Committee to
communicate the content of this motion t o the Refectory Committee
at the earliest opportunity, and to press strongly for the Refectory
Committee to set up an independent inquiry, t o find those areas
in w h i c h Improvements and economies are possible w i t h i n the
catering system at Imperial C o l l e g e .
