Rector's welcome to Freshers
It gives me great pleasure to welcome
a l l Freshers to Imperial C o l l e g e , whether
they be undergraduates, postgraduates - or,
indeed, staff. I look forward to meeting
many of you during your stay with us, and
In the meantime I w i s h you every s u c c e s s
and happiness.
George Santayana, philosopher and
sometime professor at Harvard, once
wrote: " T h e function of dons Is to
expound a few c l a s s i c documents and to
hand down as large and pleasant a store
as possible of academic habits, maxims
and a n e c d o t e s . " I doubt whether many
present members of the academic staff of
Imperial C o l l e g e would recognise them-
sleves from .Santayana's description!
Moreover, the staff are not here to
lecture A T you, but to learn WITH
you.
Although they s t i l l try to impart their
knowledge and experience In a s pleasant
a manner a s possible, they work much
harder than may once have been the c a s e
to ensure that the courses you have
chosen to follow are not only intellectually
satisfying but are a l s o relevant to your
present and future careers. Your work
w i l l be supported by some of the most
up-to-date equipment and methods
available to the world. Moreover, the
staff are not here to lecture af you, but to
learn with y o u . T h a t , at least, is the ideal
to which we aspire, even if, through
pressure of numbers and shortage of
finance and human f r a i l t i e s , we don't
a l w a y s s u c c e e d . Don't expect to be
spoon-fed, however: you are here to
learn, and learning Is not quite the same
as being taught!
I have just mentioned shortage of
finance. Inflation has hit universities
even harder than most other sectors of
the community because of the way we are
financed. Imperial C o l lege Is no except ion,
neither better off* nor worse than the rest.
Over the past few years we have had to
pay for unprecedently high wage rises and
have had to face a doubling in fuel and
food b i l l s at a time when our Income has
not been fully supplemented for the
Inflation over w h i c h w e have no control.
...as with Mr Micawber, where we
have an annual expenditure in excess
of income the result is misery,...
Most B r i t i s h universities are almost
entirely dependent upon government
funds. In our own c a s e only about 1 2 %
derives from non-government sources,
and a t a time of industrial recession
there is little hope of increasing that. We
do not have extensive reserves either,
and what we have are rapidly dwindling
because we have been u n w i l l i n g to pass
The Rector, Sir Brian Flowers
on the full effects of Inflation immediately.
However, a s with Mr Micawber, where we
have an annual expenditure in e x c e s s of
income the result is misery, and s o we
must strive to bring them into equilibrium
without sacrificing our high academic
standards.
..only too w e l l a w a r e of tljem
insufficiency of the present student
maintenance grant, and I shall
continue to press publicly for the
restoration of its earlier purchasing
power.
Although severe financial cuts are
having to be applied, a l l areas of
expenditure are therefore being carefully
studied to make sure these cuts fall
where they w i l l do least damage. In two
areas, however, we have little choice
because of government regulations. I
refer, of course, to the recent rise in
refectory prices a n d , to a lesser extent,
in hall fees, where the government insists
that h a l l s and refectories s h a l l pay their
way without s u b s i d y . T h i s means that
when the costs of fuel, food and wages
rise, prices are forced up too. We s h a l l
make every economy we c a n . and we
s h a l l welcome your views on how to d o
better. We are a l s o only too w e l l aware
of the insufficiency of the present
student maintenance grant, and I s h a l l
continue to press p u b l i c l y for the
restoration of its earlier purchasing power.
In the meantime, however, there i s no
doubt that owing to the Inconsistency of
government p o l i c i e s students are tx*lng
caught between the S c y l l a of r i s i n g prices
and the Charybdis of a grossly insufficient
grant.
So not everything is gloomy; we are
not yet digging up the croquet lawn to
grow soya beans for the refectory!
We must a l s o use every responsible
m e a n s - a n d I s t r e s s t h e w o r d
" r e s p o n s i b l e " ! - to urge upon the
government a fairer treatment of higher
education. A s far a s this C o l l e g e is
concerned w e have a good c a s e . We
pride ourselves on the later s u c c e s s e s of
our students and on the a p p l i c a t i o n of the
results of our researches to the practical
problems of a complex industrial s o c i e t y .
We make great efforts to adapt to current
needs and it is for this reason that we
hope shortly to increase our efforts in
such topical matters a s energy studies,
environmental technology and industrial
hazards. While continuing to maintain the
highest standards In s c i e n t i f i c work we
increasingly try to cater for those of you
who w i s h to pursue careers in business
or commerce or public administration, by
providing joint honours courses w h i c h
combine a s c i e n t i f i c or technological
subject w i t h Management Science or
Industrial Sociology. A n d when the
economic circumstances are better we
a l s o have plans for improving and
extending the campus, including the
provision of more student accomodation.
I also hope you will contribute to its
welfare as you would to your home,
not least by playing an active part in
the affairs of the Union.
So not everything Is gloomy; we are
not yet digging up the croquet lawn to
grow soya beans for the refectory! I c a n
assure you w e s h a l l d o a l l w e c a n to make
sure your time here both profitable and
pleasant.I hope y o u w i l l u s e a l l f a c i l i t i e s
of the C o l l e g e to the f u l l ; for the time
being it is your home. I a l s o hope you
w i l l contribute to Its welfare a s you
would to your home, not least by playing
an a c t i v e part in the affairs of the U n i o n .
If I have dwelt rather a lot on finance
in this a r t i c l e it is only partly because
of the economic s i t u a t i o n . It is no bad
thing that universities should be forced
by financial stringency to examine eyery
aspect of their work and even to recon-.
sider the e s s e n t i a l purpose of their
e x i s t e n c e ; we should not be afraid to
subject our own institution to scientifi c
scrutiny, whether it be the academic
departments, the playing f i e l d s , the
administration or the union. The end
result might even be a more effective
C o l l e g e .
RSMU
for fun!
by Nick Brayshaw.
President of Mines Union.
On behalf of the Royal School of Mines
U n i o n , it is both a n honour and a pleasure
to welcome a l l the Mining, Geology and
Metallurgy freshers to Imperial C o l l e g e
and to the R S M .
Being the smallest Constituent College
(by numbers), it is essential that we
maintain a high degree of participation to
compete with and beat opponents, and it
is largely up to y o u , a s freshers, to
a s s i s t by making a n effort to play for, or
support the RSM during the coming year.
If you d o not get the chance during the
first couple of days of term, you w i l l have
the opportunity of meeting myself a n d
fellow officers (those w h o passed their
exams, anyway) in the very near future at
a Union Meeting (always great fun!), a
Nite-Out (even better fun!!) or your Freshers
Dinner (the ultimate!!!)
After the scathing incisions made into
our Union ranks following last terms exam
results, many Union posts are now unfilled
and s o the first job of the new term is
elections in order to find replacements for
some of our dearly - departed colleagues.
Some of the posts are ideal for freshers
to have a bash at, for example, P u b l i c i t y
officer and Newsletter Editor w h i l s t some
posts are s t r i c t l y for " o l d l a g s " , for
example, Rugby C a p t a i n .
During the first few days of term, there
is always plenty to do, but one event not
to miss is the " A n n u a l Freshers P u b -
C r a w l " on Tuesday, 30th September.
Entry forms and plastic bags (for those of
a nervous disposition) w i l l be handed out
at the Mines Freshers Meeting on Mon,
afternoon or at the Freshers F a i r on T u e s .
afternoon, with the crawl commencing at
6.00 pm in the Union B a r .
The maces for the best crawlers w i l l
be presented on the following T u e s , which
is the first Union Meeting of the year
(always good for a laugh!)
