Imperial
College
Energy
Help to SLICE c osts by using energy
wisely in the College .In 1975 energy
costs, mainly for heating and electricity,
are estimated t» increase by about 50%
over last year. With no increase in the
Government grant to the College, this
means that YOU will have to make do with less - facilities
e g. laboratory materials, lecture notes, UNION grant, in
order to pay the increased energy bills.
You can help by:
"Closing all external doors and windows
'Switching off all unnecessary lights
•Using minimum hot water
•Thinking twice before switching on power con-
suming equipment - even if you are doing a
routine experiment.
•Remembering to switch off as soon as you have
finished.
In these ways you can help to SLICE the bills and help
yourself at the same time .
Any suggestions for SLICING energy costs should be
sent to
SLICE c/o Dept .of Electrical Engineering .
