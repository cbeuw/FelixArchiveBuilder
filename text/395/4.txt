Congratulations on being a student at
l C at the start of another year whether
you are a new comer or an exam wounded
veteran. T o Introduce myself; I am Stella
Godfrey, a third year (aspiring) P h y s i c i s t
and ICWA President for the coming s e s s i o n .
I hope to have the opportunity of meeting
you in the ICWA lounge at Freshers F a i r
tomorrow. Representatives from the
various groups w i t h i n ICWA w i l l be
present and refreshments w i l l be provided
free of charge.
ICWA is concerned with the welfare
and s o c i a l life of the women at C o l l e g e .
With regards to welfare, the new post of
Duputy President has been created
e s p e c i a l l y to cope with the problems
a r i s i n g , peculiar to w o m e n . T h i s year's
D P is Dani Salvador! and she i s a second
year P h y s i c i s t as is A l i s o n Halstead the
ICWA Honorary Secretary. They w i l l both
be present at the Freshers reception.
Directly linked with ICWA welfare
Involvement is the Women in Science and
Technology Group which began its
evolution during the last s e s s i o n . The
aims of the group are to explore the
difficulties they encounter in so doing.
Mutters
T h i s " M u t t e r s " w i l l be the longest on
record. I can say that p o s i t i v e l y . So s i t
d o w n . t a k e a c u p of coffee in the left hand,
and read on —
The first U G M of term w i l l be this
Thursday. A s you must known by now, the
principal business w i l l be the Refectories
i s s u e . E l s e w h e r e in this " F E L I X " , a
motion Is worded. P l e a s e read, and
consider i t . If you disagree w i t h a l l j , or
part of it, by a l l means table an amendment.
Homeless?
If you're one of those unlucky enough
to s t i l l be homeless, t h e n , w h i l s t you
look for a flat, the Union w i l l be operating
a crash pad scheme where you can at
least slumber to the early hours, and have
a wash . If you want to take advantage of
this s e r v i c e , w h i c h , incidentally is Free
(gasp!), then come to the Union and get
your name on the l i s t .
Parking.
If you are the proud owner of a motor
vehicle, then, to park in C o l l e g e , you
must a l s o be the proud owner of a
mysterious piece of paper known as a
" p a r k i n g p e r m i t " .These w i l l b e a l l o c a t e d
by a Union Committee on Saturday 4th Oct.,
and if you want a parking place, then you
must f i l l in, and return, the form available
from the Union Office before that date. If
you own a motor c y c l e , please see Mr
Dawson In Security, Sherfleld B u i l d i n g ,
and he w i l l issue a permit.
Union Handbooks & Publications.
Three publications, a l l containing
incredibly valuable information, that you
couldn't possibly afford to do without, are
now a v a i l a b l e ; the I C U , U L U & NUS
handbooks. T o be serious these are of
some relevance, e s p e c i a l l y the ICU one
(unbiased view, here), w h i c h contains
welfare & accommodation information, as
w e l l as the c l u b l i s t s , e t c . Considering,
that they're a l l free, they're excellent
value for money . Please come and take one
of each of them, from either tie registration
d e s k s , or the U n i o n .
Registration Cards.
T h i s year's ICU Membership Cards
w i l l as with NUS C a r d s , need a passport
The group meets during Wednesday lunch
time and a l l members of ICWA are welcome
to attend, in conjunction with these
meetings, lectures by s u c c e s s f u l women
s c i e n t i s t s are being organised for the
coming s e s s i o n . Karen Gadd and other
members of the group w i l l be present at
the Freshers reception to tell you more
about the agenda for next year.
ICWA has its own sports c l u b captained
by A n i t a T e l l a m from Botany 3 . The
sports c l u b or ICWSC as it is known has
enthusiastic rowing, hockey and netball
teams to name but three. For those who
would like to enroll or merely to find out
more d e t a i l s about ICWSC, there w i l l be
the opportunity of meeting A n i t a tomorrow
at Freshers F a i r .
S o c i a l l y . ICWA is one of the more
active bodies in C o l l e g e organising a
dinner, a b a l l , lunch-parties and more
general events during the s e s s i o n . The
first o f these, the annual Dinner, takes
place on Monday, October 6th. After the
dinner there w i l l be a cabaret and a bar
extension until 1.00 a m . T i c k e t s can be
purchased (yes! Y o u ' v e guessed It) at the
Freshers F a i r or later from myself In
Arising
photo, and an authorising stamp. T h i s has
been done because many shopkeepers
wouldn't take our previous cards as being
proof of identity (for student reductions,
etc.). The nearest photo booths are at
W o o l w o r t h s In High S t . Ken., and
Gloucester Road Tube Station, and before
anyone a s k s , I'd better explain that when
the " P h o t o - B o o t h p e o p l e " were contacted
several months ago, they said that they
couldn't put a temporary booth In the
Union until next week; ie. 6th Oct .(utility
coefficient - 0 0 3 ) . A n y w a y , registration
cards w i l l be stamped in the J C R , on
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday this
week, and after that (you guessed It) in
the Union Office. NUS cards w i l l a l s o be
available t h e n .
Elections.
T h i s place Is plagued with committees,
not that, in Itself is bad, its just that it
involves countless elections; and that Is
not, per se, a bad thing either, this being
the democratic world that we live In. But
the crunch comes when half the people
elected fail their exams! ",To lose one
Council member might be regarded as
unfortunate, to lose five looks like
carelessness" to misquote a w e l l known
Victorian P l a y w r i g h t . So here follows a
list of those places now vacant. If you
are Interested In either standing or just
curious as to what some of the posts do,
"Dome up and see me sometime" (ugh
another quote).

We have as our V i c e President, Lady
F l o w e r s . A s w e l l as being present
(hopefully!) at the F r e s h e r s F a i r

sewing machine. The ICWA lounge,
situated on the first floor of the Union

room for use from 9.30 am until 5 3 0 pm.

say other than, see you at the Freshers

That lot, you may gather,contains
some very important posts — and the
P G A O has a l s o to be elected! I regard it
as damaging to the U n i o n that s o many
posts are vacant at the start of term, and
I intend to raise the problem at C o u n c i l ,
and get some action on it — for more
exciting d e t a i l s see the " F E L I X "
report on the October 13th. C o u n c i l
Meeting.
Tittle Tattle.
I'm nearly finished, so award your-
selves ten points and another cup of
coffee for getting this far. One more point
which I think needs making is that, in the
Union office, a l l members have a very
powerful focus for information . We have
information about a host of things, from
the addresses of legal aid centres (not
to mention the Unoin solicitor), to direct
lines with NUS at E n d s i e i g h Street. I,
personally, would be delighted to help
anyone who is seeking information about
E n d s l e i g h , the Rent A c t , good local pubs,
or anything remotely to do with C o l l e g e .
Indeed, I intend to run a r t i c l e s on such
topics in future e d i t i o n s . So if you need
information, I would hope that one of the
places y o u ' l l come to w i l l be the U n i o n .
For example, did you know that B R Travel
Cards are a v a i l a b l e as from 1st October
at the cost of £5.40p. (inc. V A T ) ? W e l l ,
never mind. T h a t ' s about it for now;
incidentally, I didn't start this article
with a flowery 'Welcome F r e s h e r s ' bit
because by the end of the week 8 reckon
that y o u ' l l have been welcomed quite
often enough.
See you around,
John

and very witty Honorary Secretary of
