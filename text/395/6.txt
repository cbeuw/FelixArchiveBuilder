A report on the
4th annual Southern Africa Conference
The conference held at Salford
University on the weekend of the first
week in J u l y (4 - 6 July 1975) was
opened by Sue Slipman, the new N U S
National Secretary. In a brief speech she
laid down the foundations of what was to
become a very interesting and very
instructive conference. She was followed
by J e n M c C l e l l a n d . A A M F i e l d Officer and
executive member .Ms M c C l e l l a n d outlined
the tasks w h i c h A A M performs.
"AAM is basically an information
distributor," she s a i d ."Our main job is
to laise with organisations who support
the Liberation movements in Southern
Africa." A A M a l s o held seminars and
could provide speakers for t a l k s . "AAM
is a membership organisation and I would
ask those of you who have not joined
already to do so", she c o n c l u d e d .
The introductions were followed by
two films, one being the now famous
"Last Grove at Dimbaza" . The first film
concerned Namibia and its liberation
movement S W A P O (South West A f r i c a
People's Organisation for Namibia). It
provided an h i s t o r i c a l background to the
struggles in Namibia and a l s o gave an
insight to the a c t i v i t i e s of S W A P O .
S W A P O w a s not only leading a revolution-
ary struggle, it w a s a l s o educating its
supporters and members p o l i t i c a l l y in the
process.
Throughout the conference, members
of the liberation movement stressed the
very high importance they gave to this
aspect of their work.
Barry Minis low of C F M A G (Committee
for Freedom in Mozambique, Angola and
Guinea) showed s l i d e s taken earlier this
year in Mozambique. F R E L I M O having led
the Mozambiquane to independence were
strenuously trying to bring mass lite a c y
to the country and s o create political
awareness amongst the mass of the
population. One significant point to
emerge is that F R E L I M O did not fight to
end white domination. It fought against a
minority group (of whites and blacks) led
by the white Portugese upper c l a s s in
Portugal who d i d not have the support of
the Portugese working c l a s s who were
mandatorily conscripted to fight the
F R E L I M O g u e r i l l a s ,
F R E L I M O have set In motion an
intensive and radical programme w h i c h
w i l l bring the country prosperity and
result in the establishment of a peoples
r e p u b l i c . T h e s u c c e s s of their task Is
regarded a s of the utmost importance,
s i n c e it would set a precedent in the
trend in which revolutionary governments
develop, e s p e c i a l l y in Southern A f r i c a .
The second and longest day of the
conference began with a speech by Joe
Slovo, a South A f r i c a n barrister, who is
now in e x i l e . Mr Slovo is a leading figure
in the liberation movement of South A f r i c a
and defended many p o l i t i c a l t r i a l s . In the
Treason T r i a l s of 1958-61 he was himself
a defendant.
In a speech lasting nearly an hour Mr
Slovo attacked, vehemently, Mr Vorster's
regime s a y i n g , "The institutionalisation
of rascism in South Africa is what places
apartheid oppression^part from any other
form of oppression". He went o n . "The
view of the moral libera lists that apartheid
and white supremacy will die a natural
death has been demonstrably shattered in
the last three decades. Industrial progress
has forced the apartheid regime to suck
''in more and more blacks thus giving them
rights that they would not otherwise
enjoy ... the increasing dependence of
the white colonialists on black sweat and
skill makes the whites more jealous of
their supremacy and In this context it can
be seen that the apartheid regime is
retreating - no matter how minimal this
retreat i s " .
He a l s o attacked the Bantustanisation
and " d e t e n t e " p o l i c i e s of Vorster
d e c l a r i n g "Vorster is now fanatically
seeking to create dialogue and institute a
neo-colonialist system by the setting up
of the Bantu homelands with puppet black
officials." It is these very homelands
which are now being used a s dumping
grounds for " p a s s l a w s " offenders.
"Armed struggle is the only way to
bring down the apartheid regime and to
counsel otherwise is to admit submission"
he concluded a s delegates rose to give
him a thunderous o v a t i o n . T h i s view is
now the line which the O A U is adopting
and with there being a real p o s s i b i l i t y of
a " b l a c k liberation army being s e t up by
them to help achieve this a i m . ' A l l the
speakers who followed a l s o reiterated
this in their s p e e c h e s . There w a s no
denying the Increased militant attitudes
of leavers of the liberation organisations.
Mr Johnson Ndhlovu, A N C (Zimbabwe)
spoke next on the situation in Zimbabwe
(Rhodesia) and the events that had taken
place up to date. T h e unity agreement
reached by the various liberation move-
ments in Zimbabwe led to the formation
of a joint committee. Its task was to draft
a constitution for the reconstituted A N C
(Zimbabwe) and secondly, to draft a
programme of the objectives w h i c h the
liberation had to a c h i e v e . "Unfortunately
it (the committee) failed in this task" and
further "attempts to set up a congress to
formalise the leadership of this body and
make them responsible to the peoples also
failed", Mr Ndnlovu s a i d .
He went on to say that he believed
that F R E L I M O should be compensated for
any losses Incurred during the fighting.
Thus he welcomed thedevelopedCommon-
wealth nations (Canada, U K , A u s t r a l i a ,
and N Z ) proposal to a s s i s t the F R E L I M O
government f i n a n c i a l l y a s w e l l as
t e c h n i c a l l y .
M l s c k Muyongo, a c t i n g V P of S W A P O ,
then took up the case of the liberation
struggle in N a m i b i a . He stressed the
need to look at the positive approach
being taken in N a m i b i a . "Do not believe
all you read in the British press", he
commented. He w a s a l s o optimistic that
the infighting taking place would be
overcome. N a m i b i a ' s problems were firstly
the presence of South A f r i c a and secondly
the foreign investors w h o wished to
maintain the status q u o . "Vorster's
pretentious claims to wanting the problem
of Namibia solved is just a front put on
in the UN for international recognition of
hjs "detente" policies," he s a i d .
In h i s speech he made the point that
U N were unable to take any constructive
steps to try and resolve the problems of
N a m i b i a . T h i s inability w a s the result of
vetoes exercised by B r i t a i n , France, and
USA in the U N Security C o u n c i l . H o w e v e r ,
the U N was a good platform from which
? W A P O Could receive international
support for its fight to liberate and
achieve Independence for the peoples of
N a m i b i a .
The only remaining country whose
problems had not been spoken of was
A n g o l a . Barry Munslow, member of the
Committee for Freedom in Mozambique,
A n g o l a and Guinea ( C F M A G ) , remedied
this in a n eloquent delivery. Angola
occupied a unique position in A f r i c a due
to its richness in natural resources
including o i l and g o l d . T h i s meant that
huge amounts of foreign investment
poured into the country.
However, some of this money was
a l s o used to back F N L A (National Front
for the Liberation of A n g o l a ) . F N L A ,
whose leader Holden Roberts is the
brother-in-law of General Mobutu, is
a l s o backed by the Z a i r e government.
Consequently, many of the F N L A troops
are Z a i r e a n s and one can only communicate
with them in F r e n c h ! U N I T A (National
Union for the Total Independence of
Angola) is the South A f r i c a n backed
so c a l l e d liberation organisation. T h i r d ,
but by no means least, is M P L A (Popular
Movement for the Liberation of Angola)
which has received communist b a c k i n g .
It represents " p o p u l a r democratic power"
involving nine million Angolans in
thinking, participating and implementing
the government in order to achieve
economic and s o c i a l independence.
Duma Nokwa, executive member of
A N C (South Africa) a n d Z o l a Zembe
joined the line of distinguished speakers
at the conference. Mr Nokwa talked at
length and w i th emoti on about Bram F ischer
and the indignity and degredation he
suffered at the hands of the South A f r i c a n
regime. Apparently, South A f r i c a want
his ashes In prison for fear of a shrime
being erected In h i s honour. Conference
stood in s i l e n c e for one minute to pay
tribute to Bram F ischer.
Z o l a Zembe described the treatment
metted out to himself and fellow prisoners
i n i a l l its gory detalI. Shocked delegates
listened to tales of brutality comparable
only with N a z i torture s e s s i o n s . There
had been over 11 m i l l i o n people imprisoned
on " p o l i t i c a l c h a r g e s " between 1948 and
1 9 7 5 . H i s s o n , we learned, had just been
arrested, beaten up and had h i s eardrums
burst.
It was against this background that
delegates held d i s c u s s i o n s and eventually
passed resolutions to support and
campaign on the Issue of liberation for
Southern A f r i c a . The campaign w i l l be
centred around two areas â€” solidarity
and combatting c o l l a b o r a t i o n . The
solidarity aspect of the campaign w i l l
involve such actions a s adoption of
students, sending medical packs to M P L A ,
S W A P O etc and sponsored walks . Central
to the campaign a s a whole w i l l be N U S
liaison with A M M (Antl-Apartheld Move-
ment and work with trade unions at a
local level.
T h i s , the fourth annual conference and
attracted the largest number of delegates
ever, from the largest number of c o n -
stituent organisations. T h e conference
a l s o benefited enormously from the
presence of prominent members of the
A N C (African National Congress) and
liberation movements such as S W A P O .
