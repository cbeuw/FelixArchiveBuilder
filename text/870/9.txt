Heat of the city
'Industry is losing graduates to accountancy and the
City' we are told. One only has to glance into the
careers fair to realise that there is some truth in this.
Most of the big accountancy firms are present, but
with little representation from the City, most people
are left in the dark as to what 'the City' might be. This
apparent reluctance to advertise itself is curious when
the accountancy firms are delighted to explain the
sublime pleasures of auditing...
The reason is that the international banks in the City
typically receive 50-100 applications per job. This is
a big headache for personnel departments, and
advertising only serves to make things worse.
This still leaves a problem for undergraduates
wishing to obtain information about careers in finance.
The popular media presents archetypal yuppies as
either Oxbridge graduates or barrow boys who have
hit the big time. They are paid a stack to shout 'buy'
or 'sell' at random intervals and insider deal
throughout the day. They then drive at high speed in
a Porsche to the wine bar and spend the evening
bowling, whilst smashed on champagne.
This is a very amusing image, but totally useless.
To obtain a realistic picture, the careers centres here
at Imperial and ULU are good places to start. They
stock pamphlets, career profiles and company
brochures, although these go missing quickly because
not many are sent out. Even the reference copies
occasionally 'disappear'. ULU also has cuttings from
the financial press.
However this is still an outsider's view. The only
time one can obtain a real insight into what actually
goes on, without being under pressure of interview,
is on a special course run by the University of London
Careers Advisory Service, called the 'City Course'.
The course costs £15, and lasts from Monday to
Friday in the week immediately prior to the start of
the autumn term. This is cheap compared to a similar
course run by the Financial Times which lasts three
days and costs £700!
The course consists of a series of informal
presentations in the offices of different financial
institutions, such as international banks,
stockbrokers, management consultants and various
financial exchanges. This year's programme is listed
below.
The presentations begin with an outline of what the
organisation does, current areas of recruitment,
followed by what each job entails and any special
skills or requirements for that role. Then there is some
time to speak to recent graduates. It is not a formal
careers presentation, so they can tell you the way it
actually is, and you can ask them awkward questions
like 'Do you enjoy your job enough to compensate for
having to wake up at 5.00am, be under pressure all
day, and have practically no social life except at the
weekend'.
Apart from all this careers information, the course
I attended was interesting in itself, with visits to the
floors of various exchanges during trading hours,
including the Foreign Exchange money market dealing
room of an international bank. Also in the programme
was a discussion with a financial journalist and, for
some reason, a speech by the Lord Mayor of London
in the Mansion House.
At the end of the course, everybody had a greatly
improved knowledge of what the various careers in
the City were, and whether they were actually
attracted to them. The companies who attended were
keen to interview students, having hired similar people
in the past.
For anyone who might be interested in a career in
finance, the 'City Course' offers an invaluable insight
into what really happens, giving you a headstart over
other applicants and enabling you to make a rational
career decision, based on fact.
Application forms are available in the careers library
now.
