Cheesy Wotsits
Suited sportsmen quaff
their beer whilst highly
qualified DJs blast out
their favourite action-
laden classics. H o w
does 'Tragedy' go?

either in the JCR or in
dB's.

Casinoes, heists, money,

Monsters Inc.
Yeah, so it might be
funny, but what you
really need to know
about is what they've
got in their computers.
Like, those 1337-MF
CPUs really kick ass!
Happy Splatter and the
Joke's Wearing Thin
Surely they've run out of
screaming children and
amorous teenagers to
show this to? I might
have to think up a new
amusing concept soon!
Vanilla Sky
Mmmm. Vanilla. Good
for three things - putting
in ice cream, sniffing to
encourage weight loss,
and smearing on...
Anyway, Tom Cruise
stars, apparently.
From Hell
Unusually, Johnny Depp
plays a troubled, slightly
mystical character who,
to add an extra twist, is
clairvoyant. M s Voyant
is considering legal
action. Arf, arf.
It's Mine once again for
the dove from above.

Beth Orton, and friends
I don't know if you need
a Central Reservation
for this one. Snigger.
Beth Orton apparently
appears with other
acoustic and folky types.
Cherry Jam, free - £7
M a n u Chao
Their website was out
there, man. A l l very hal-

wierd music. I can only
imagine that's what
they play.
Shepherd's Bush Empire
Defenestration
You're all erudite people,
and know full well that
this means throwing
stuff out of a window.
Whether or not this lot
deserve it is up to you...
Garage
Anamorphic
"Dark moody smoulder-
ing dark wave that
tastes of lusciously
quiet and rather velvetly
erotic things..." Well,
yes.
Monarch, Camden
Deep Purple
Long hair, absence of
sleeves. Yes, it's one of
those bands. But, they
played Grimsby and sur-
vived to sing again, so
they must be tough...
