No theme or any such nonsense for you this week I'm afraid. I've been
far too busy watching my inspiration and may I say, personal hero: Dr.
Fox, lament over the hapless youngsters on 'cock idol'. Although, unlike
me he is not a real fox, he does share my admiration for that Sultan of
Stilton, Darius Danesh. Clearly, we the general public need Darius in our
lives, and until he teams up to do a duet (or form a pro-wrestling tag-
team) with that fat bloke Rick, the world will be a lesser place. In other
news, this weeks winner is Tom Tibbits, Phys 4. Next week I might have
something good to write about, but then again I probably won't.
