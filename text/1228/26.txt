Ultimate Frisbee
Discdoctors arrived at Bristol
with a confidence that they
were better than most teams at
the tournament. The first game
was won with ease, Doctors
winning 13-0 against a very
understrength UWE. Doctors
didn't even break into a sweat.
The next game was a little
more of a challenge, as the
Picnic 2 team did in fact turn
up. Doctors played a solid
game, scoring six points in thir-
teen minutes with one point in
reply from an inexperienced
Picnic 2 team. A s A l rightly
said at the end of the game, it
was a good practice for us.
The next game was a tight 3-
2 win over the Slurry Slingers
from Surrey. Although Doctors
were clearly a better team,
somehow the Surrey players
managed to keep it very tight
and it was as close as the score
suggested. This was, however,
the turning point of the tourna-
ment.
The next game was against
the tournament veterans, Mr
Men. Unfortunately, they man-
aged to find five players for the
game against us, so our tactics
had to change a little. We
played solidly against their
zone, but couldn't find the scor-
ing pass. Despite having con-
tinued possession, the M r Men
won the game 4-0. This result
left Doctors second in the first
pool, taking us into the second
round guaranteeing a top ten
finish.
The next game was against
Mythago, and Doctors knew
that they were a much better
team than them. However,
scoring again proved to be a
problem, and we lost the game
6-4. Despite a good attempt at
a comeback, Doctors had left it
too late, and the game was in
the hands of the home team.
The crowd were certainly on
their side, which perhaps
helped diminish the Doctors'
spirits.
After that disappointing
result, the Doctors were confi-
dent that they could beat the
Purple Haze team, seeing as
man for man, we were a much
better team. However, after a
very poor start, the Doctors
heads dropped, and we were
humiliated 8-0.
The Sunday morning, after
an uneventful party, Doctors
were rejuvenated, and knew
that the skill within the team
would take us to a good finish.
A match against Bears woke
us up... to a loss. However, we
were definitely a better team
than them.
The next game was against
Purple Haze Old Boys. We were
confident that our superior fit-
ness would take us to an easy
w i n over the aged players.
After a good start, Purple Haze
Old Boys came back, and then
took the game 5-3 (or some-
thing like that).
This left us with a ninth-
tenth place final against the
old foe, Slurry Slingers. On the
bigger pitch, the Doctors clear-
ly made use of their speed and
more accurate passing, and
took and early 4-0 lead. Then
they relaxed a little, and the
Slingers came back to 6-5. The
crucial pass to level it 6-6 was
dropped by a slinger, and the
Doctors went on to take the
game comfortably, ending up
ninth in the tournament. But
we're a better team than that.

It was a fine sunny day, and
we arrived at Harlington with
hope and love in our hearts.
We've been concentrating on
our intensive training regime
involving Classy yet Camp
Fabian and Dave (no comment
there Charlotte, nudge nudge
wink wink), hoping to improve
on some aspects of our game.
Evil cap-ee-tan lost the toss,
but still we started strongly
with a lot of possession and
made some territory, after that
although we had a share of
the possession we were made
to work hard to keep out the
tries.
Tackling and support were
greatly improved off the back
of last Sunday's match and
everyone had a stunning
game. Special credit goes to
Dan and A s h new girlies who
won forward and back of the
match respectively, for their
stunning running and defen-
sive efforts.
Our committee must also
have a mention with Fetish
Queen, vice cap-ee-tan, just
ask about the latex; Hooker,
Charlie; Gem, random man
and Beth, no random man, for
a change.
