The match started w i t h a
quick sensational try scored
by Ricky, the Italian interna-
tional, finally over his barrel
spell of two years! A l l the
merit really goes to the
Nigerian international A c i ,
back from a nasty injury, and
yet again proving his tremen-
dous talent and skills with a
prefect-timed pass, which cut
the back line and reached
Ricky for an easy try in the
middle of the post, easily con-
verted by Huy.
With 7 points behind us in
the first two minutes, all the
boys were looking pretty con-
fident and with sensational fly
half Chen-Cheun playing as
scrumhalf and ginger boy
Bobby at the fly half, the game
became very interesting!
Bobby kept on kicking the ball
so high that it could be ^
mistaken for a landing I
airplane, giving the
ball to the oppo-
sition! He even-
tually scored a .•
try in the •
middle of the
post giving us
a 14 to nil advan-
tage thanks to his famous eye-
brow dummy. The first half
seemed to end up with a cor-
ner try by the opposition...
good effort from medics boys
but frankly really not good
enough! That's because A c i
quickly responded w i t h an
interception and scored a
magnificent try in the middle
of the post for
an easy con-
v e r s i o n

The second half started
with the medics well up for a
big turn of the game in their
favour but, as if it could ever
happen, they did not get any-
thing better than a drop goal
in the middle of the second
Wr to
half (after two attempts).
Defence from IC first was bril-
liant with the boys all over the
place and keeping GKT well
out from their twenty-two. No
more points were scored and
the match ended up 21 - 8.
Another victory for the mighty
IC first and another medics
team defeated. (Gosh! I'm
tired of beating Medics
around).
With the last game of the
league played, IC now faces
the big challenge of the B U S A
plate and even more challeng-
ing Guttridge Cup. God save
Captain Sven! (Praying is
probably his last hope for
finally finishing a game!)
Rugby III
IC III 12 Essex II 32
We waited, and waited and
finally the coach arrived an
hour late, Rich. The thirds
were on a mighty tour to the
pits of Essex. Walking out
onto the pitch with 14 men
thanks to a clearly inept refer-
ee was our first kick in the bol-
locks. However, this really
didn't affect our play! The
match began and after some
good rucking by IC we were in
the opponents 22, but it was
not to be with a quick turn
over they stormed down the
field and dropped the ball over
our line... however it was a
try. Their kicker, who seemed
to have replaced his foot with
a coat hanger, missed the con-
version. Our casual approach
to the game and blatant bias
from the ref led to another 3
tries from the inbreeds.
However, after half time we
came back to storm over the
line. If Nightingale's first
name had been Florence there
would have been more
patients dead than at the
charge of the light brigade;
with an ability to catch sec-
ond only to Graham Norton's
with soap in a prison shower
the turnover in play helped
the MacDonald's mingers to
slip another two past. The
mighty Imperial came back to
dish out more shoe pie and
scored a magnificent try from
Desmond the monkey. The
journey back was more event-
ful with Matt "Taffy" Laffan
vomiting everywhere, after
only 3 litres of cider, and Svet
the captain groping various
random team members and
pronouncing "hip hop forever".
Even though we failed to
uphold Silva's good name we
managed to grope her sister in
Hombres later on. Alex
