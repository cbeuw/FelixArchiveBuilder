society revue
Last Thursday saw this year's
international night coming
together after months of
preparation and work by the
Overseas Committee Team,
and specifically Ram
Ramanan, the organiser of the
event.
The concept of the event is
for the international societies
to have an opportunity to
express their o w n cultures to
one another, as well as to the
numerous home students who
come to watch the event every
year. In the past it has been
marred by political differences,
which have been expressed by
students booing various acts,
and in one case even storming
the stage. This has also led to
punch ups back stage, and
therefore this year, there were
more stewards present to
ensure that the security of the
event was not compromised.
Perhaps due to this, or
maybe perhaps due to improv-
ing relations, there weren't any
such problems this year, how-
ever, the flagship show caused
problems of its own, through
the use of pyrotechnics that
set the fire alarm off. This
resulted in the mass evacua-
tion of the great hall, as well as
the rest of Sherfield, that last-
ed around half an hour.
Happily most of the audience
were eager to stick around,
and so thirty minutes later the
Hall refilled to enjoy the first
show. However, any mood that
had been built up would obvi-
ously have been destroyed by
this point, so the first act of the
evening, which belonged to
the Pakistan Society, was to
have guite a job getting every-
one back into the mood.
However, the choice was good,
and the comedy based on
arranged marriage brought the
show back up to its original
tempo, paving the way for the
rest of the show.

It would be impossible in the
space allowed to go through
every act, and while some
were certainly... interesting, all
had clearly received a lot of
care and attention from each'
society.
The problem with a show
such as this is that cultural dif-
ferences are very difficult to
express in such a short amount
of time, and since no-one can
be aware of all cultures, often
misunderstanding can occur
as to the point that is trying to
be made.
As an example of this, one of
my personal favourite acts was
that of the Singapore society,
which I found very reminiscent
of the time I have spent in
Singapore over several
months. I'm not sure I would
have found it so good, howev-
er, were I not already aware of
some of the culture.
A s k i n g around after the
show, I found that three shows
had really stood out in many
peoples' minds. They were the
Afro-Caribbean Society, the
Japanese Society, and the
Bangladeshi Society.
The Afro-Caribbeans put on
an amazingly high energy
show, and were also remem-
bered for the lack of clothing
/ t
they were sporting.
Japan was a very funny
short play based on the adven-
tures of Super Mario, with all
his friends and enemies
depicted by cardboard cut
outs, all accompanied by that
irritatingly catchy tune from
the game.
The Bangladeshi Society
could be seen to be the con-
science of the show, with prob-
ably the most political act,
showing a man's trip around
the country in a rickshaw,
observing the beauty and pain
in the country.
Also I must mention Shovi
and Ruth, who did a fantastic
job of holding everything
together with their presenting,
and keeping us amused during
the scene changes.
What really got me, howev-
er, was the after show party.
Everyone from all the societies
were there, and I have to say
that for the first time in five
years at this college, I realised
how truly international we can
be. Bring it on.
