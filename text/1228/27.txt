Get Out The Big Guns
Fullbore Fiesta
On Sunday 10th February the
tranquillity of the sleepy vil-
lage of Bisley was shattered by
the ravenous hordes of the IC
Rifle and Pistol Club's first full
bore shoot of the N e w Year at
the NRA's Range. Nick Keith
and Laurie, three of the clubs
more "mature" members joined
us w i t h their collection of
antique (a shooting term
meaning fun but wildly inaccu-
rate) firearms.
The Sky w a s clear and the
fresh country air entering our
pollution conditioned lungs
endowed us all with superhu-
man powers. After a brief
shopping trip to buy enough
ammunition to make even the
seasoned locals look uneasy
we set up for our day's sport.
Ben, Dan and Phil went to the
50 metre range to do some
accurate shooting with their
.22 target rifles. The rest of us
made ourselves as comfortable
as w e could in the muddy field
of the 200 yard Short Siberia
range. Yu and Jordan did some
excellent shooting with the
scope 7.62 rifle. While Jacob's
new (in geological terms at
least) Number 4 s a w some
heavy use as everyone wanted
to have a crack. Jacob's vari-
ous claims that his poor shoot-
ing was due to the sights, the
barrel, the ammunition and an
unmerciful G o d were roundly
disproved by everyone else
achieving near pinpoint accu-
racy.
After a quick spot of lunch
we were rejoined by our small
bore friends a n d given a
demonstration of the true
meaning of accuracy w i t h
Laurie's civil w a r vintage
Peabody. Through expert
shooting he was able to make
all the rounds reach the end of
the range with some even hit-
ting the target. A t this point,
half the group split off for an
afternoon of clay pigeon shoot-
ing while the rest persevered
with the rifles. The day s a w
the grand unveiling of the
club's n e w 30-06 which gar-
nered approving comments
from all who used it. Despite
being of first world war vin-
tage it shot perfectly well and
the bull received repeated
pepperings from all.
All to soon the claxon sound-
ed and everyone had to return
to the b i g city where our re-
exposure to the smoke a n d
fumes turned us back into mild
mannered students. Thanks
must be given to Ben's brother
for his chauffeuring duties. We
would also like to point out
that no animals were harmed
in the making of this trip.
If you fancy trying your hand
at rifle shooting, or clay
pigeon, air pistol and other dis-
ciplines, the Imperial College
Rifle and Pistol club meets at
the range in the Sports Centre
on Wednesdays from 1pm to
late and Saturdays from 1pm to
6pm.

After an exciting start to the
race in Guildford, things began
to settle down, with Imperial
athletes i n contention. With
the women only having to run
half the distance of the men,
their enthusiasm w a s dis-
played with Louise once again
taking control of the race, fin-
ishing strongly i n 2nd place.
Sarah also ran well, for IC's A
team to finish 14th.
In the men's race IC's teams
were heavily depleted, miss-
ing many of their star runners
who h a d performed so
admirably at BUSA. Despite
this Francois showed his class
and led the w a y for the IC
team, finishing 2nd. Close
behind were Chris in 5th, and
Roly in 12th.
Dave missed a turning, but
fortunately his faithful team-
mate 'New Boy' Dom was i n
close attendance and showed
him the right way, with them
ultimately finishing 13th and
14th, a n d Jeff w a s close
behind i n 15th. Guy, Seb and
debutant Michael all ran well
to help the B team secure
another strong finish.
Dan after his exploits at the
weekend (cycling from
Penzance to London for a bet!)
managed to work his w a y
through the field to finish 28th.
Behind h i m were the ever
dependable Mike a n d G i l .
Mike suffered great problems
with his n e w spikes that
caused.severe bleeding to the
back of both heels, yet still
managed his best race of the
year.
After this Imperial went back
to continue the organisation of
the 54th Hyde Park Relays. The
relays, which are the largest
student relays i n Europe, will
take place on Saturday and any
IC member wishing to take
