Bees
Oh Dear! Not all is rosy in
Euroland, it seems. European
bee-keepers will this week be
staging militant protests in
Brussels. The object? Better
working conditions for their
workers - the honeybees.
It seems that the legions of
farmers, mostly from Spain,
France and Italy, are unhappy
about the lack of recognition
their invaluable insects make
to local ecologies.
They argue that the pollen
delivery systems, propped up
by the bees, constitute a
"service" - and that the bees
should be recompensed
accordingly. For example, they
should be allowed to have a
monopoly over honey trade in
the EU, as a reward for the
bees' hard work. This would
outlaw Mexican honey, for
example (currently around half

The bees themselves are not
expected to attend the
protest, due to the cold.
Panic
Thousands of Argentines
rushed to but US dollars this
week, in an effort to safeguard
their savings against inflation.
Their actions were prompt-
ed by the final separation of
the Argentinian peso from the
dollar.
Although the economy of
the South American country
had appeared strong to many,
the separation from the strong
American currency - pegged
to the peso for over twenty
years - has raised fears of
inflation and ruin among the
population, who are lapping
up the dollars despite govern-
ment pleas for calm.

Former Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic awaits
trial for war crimes at The
Hague this week. Although
the list of war crimes he is
charged with is both horrify-
ing and shocking, the former
leader shows no sign of
remorse.
In a statement released this
week, the defendant insisted
that he was ready for the trial,
and that he would use the
opportunity to "tell the truth"
about the bloody conflict.

A former Nazi will have an
operation to remove a large
tattoo paid for by the state,
Associated Press reports.
Darren Lee Letourneau, 31,
will have the series of opera-
tions - which will cost a total
of Â£2,870 - paid for by taxpay-
ers because he says he has
given up the tenets of
National Socialism after
"much reflection" in prison.
After leaving jail, hopefully
early in next year, Letourneau
also hopes to speak out
against racism, particularly to
juveniles and young adults.
He is currently serving a 10-
year sentence for a mixture of
offences, including robberies,
assault and weapons
offences.
Reactions in Canada were
mixed. While some groups
were lukewarm at the
prospect of using taxpayers'
money to fund a convict's
image change, others were
enthusiastic about the move.
In particular, Rubin
Friedman, a spokesman for the
Canadian Jewish Congress
voiced his approval. The deci-
sion, he said, represented an
"action for good" in the world,
adding that it meant "one less
racist swastika."
Prison warder Alex Lubimov
agreed that Letourneau had
shown a massive improve-
ment in attitude over the past
couple of years.
"He no longer believes in
the things the swastika
stands for," he explained, "in
fact, he now believes that his
past actions were wrong and
evil. He is keen to do whatev-
er he can to put that right."

(Reuters) A large bush-fire in
California this week continued
to grow out of control. As well
as residential, municipal and
industrial buildings, the fire
also threatened the very gov-
ernment of the United States
of America in the form of the
U.S. Marine Corps base near
San Diego.
Outrage in the region that
the fire - which has already
destroyed over 30 homes and
forced the evacuation of thou-
sands at time of going to press
- be allowed to spread out of
control was heightened when
it became apparent that the
marines were unable to fight
fires on their own base effec-
tively due to cuts in the train-
ing budget.
The regular firefightmg
units were taken aback by the
scale and ferocity of the blaze,
which is reckoned by many to
be the worst in 50 years. Over
700 men, including aerial
units, are currently involved.
The fires, which have been
fanned throughout the fort-
night-long blaze by a strong
easterly wind, were only halt-
ed by the Pacific Ocean in the
south. Now, however, the
wind has shifted suddenly to
the south. The bush fires - in
an area untouched since the
great Scrub Fires of 85 years
ago have correspondingly
swung north, threatening the
cities of San Diego and even
LA, at 14 million residents one
of America's biggest cites.
Although millions of kilos of
explosive are kept at the mili-
tary base, Navy spokesman
Gregg Smith insisted there
was "no danger" to civilians.
