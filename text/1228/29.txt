The wait is over, the bars are open, the collection tins are labelled and the tiddlywinks have been
unwrapped. Imperial Rag Week begins today, bringing with it seven full days of wine, women,
song and good old fashioned silliness - and don't forget, every pint you drink, every game you
play, every Ragwich you eat and every silly costume you wear will help to raise money for charity.
So dont feel embarrassed, dont feel silly, dont feel shy - just get out there and enjoy yourself!
Over the page you'll find a cut-out-and-keep guide to all this week's events, covering everything from
excessive drinking to cinema and band nights and street collections to... erm, more excessive
drinking, actually. Whatever you're into, there's something for you, so whether you want to bin your
timetable and party all week, head out onto the streets of London with collecting tin in hand or just
embarrass the hell out of your nearest and dearest, there's no excuse for not getting involved. Just
remember that every penny raised this week goes to the Shooting Star Trust, helping them to give London's
terminally ill children a home - and if that doesn't guilt trip you into getting involved, then I don't know what will...
