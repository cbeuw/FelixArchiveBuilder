IC RADIO
Matt and Sam, the dynamic duo of radio,
are rarely visible to the public eye. They
exist in a fantasy world, removing them-
selves from society as a whole. However,
after some coaxing but mainly blatant
threatening they have emerged, dirty and
smelly, from their hermit cave in the fur-
thest reaches of Outer Bayswater to give
this exclusive interview to Felix:
So, guys, why did you call your show
'The Matt 'n' Sam Show?'
Matt: Well, we were going to go with
just 'and' but for artistic purposes we
eventually went for 'n.'
Sam: Lack of originality, really...
What's your show all about?
Matt: It's an orgasmic blend of sensu-
ous music, hilariously amusing features
and sickeningly professional links.
Sam: Yeah, complete bollocks really...
Do you have many listeners?
Matt: Yes
Another high quality web-cam photo
Sam: No. Sorry, it's his ego. By the way
if any wants to listen in we'd really appre-
ciate it. Talking to yourself for two hours
isn't fun... no honestly!!!
What sort of music do you play?
Matt: Not telling you.
Sam: The wanker's in a sulk now. Don't
worry, just give him one of those lollies
and he'll shut up for while...We play
everything from up-to-the-minute dance
tracks to classic tunes from M C Hammer
and Nick Kershaw... actually we don't
really play his songs (nervous laughter).
Matt, since leaving IC last summer
you've only made a few appearances on
the show, leaving Sam to flounder through
on his own. Sam, you've been reported to
be suffering from chronic suicidal depres-
sion, as illustrated in this photo. What do
you have to say?
Sam: Well, yeah, it's depressing sitting
there on your own but it's probably better
than being stuck in there with this boring
bastard!
Matt: At least I don't cock up the
equipment all the time.
Sam: Try and do the show without me
then you cheeky bastard...
At this point the interview degenerated
into something out of Mortal Kombat, the
scenes are not suitable for children, stu-
dents and domesticated animals.
You can tune into the Matt 'n' Sam show
every Saturday at midday on IC Radio -
999Mhz A M and icradio.com.
Alternatively you couldn't.
ICU Arts Festival
The ICU Arts Festival is an event espe-
cially dedicated to promoting the arts
societies of Imperial College. The first
ever arts festival will take place from the
20th February to the 1st March this year
and will feature everyone from the IC
Choir to Classical Guitar. This is your
chance to see exactly what each arts soci-
ety does, and maybe even find out what
you have been missing out on all this
time.
There are three nights that you should
put into your diary, with the times when
everything begins.

Choir will be performing Mahler together,
in what will undoubtedly be a fantastic
display of musical talent.
Tickets Available from the Blyth Music
Centre, £2.50/£6.50 in advance, £3/£7 on
the door.
There will also be exhibitions from Photo
Soc, Phoenix (Literature), Leonardo (Fine
Arts) and the Origami Society taking
place around campus at lunchtimes.
The ICU Arts Festival's debut is sure to
go with a bang - but it doesn't end there.
This is to be the first of many annual arts
festivals happening at Imperial College.
That means that any IC student who has
missed out on being involved this year
has now got twelve months to prepare for
the next one.
This really is a unique opportunity to
showcase your work and get yourself
noticed as a performer, artist or musician
- or whatever you can do!
But this isn't the only way, to get
involved. You can help run the events this
year, or if you want to decide how the ICU
Arts Festival 2003 goes, you can form part
of next year's committee.
So don't forget, the ICU Arts Festival is
here to show that Imperial College isn't
just about science
