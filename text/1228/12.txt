Fellowship of the Ring
The source of much
hilarity in the office this
week, as w e veto yet
another run of highly
amusing arse jokes.
Doesn't mean w e can't
ridicule hobbits, though.
Black H a w k D o w n
See this week's special
"Bird Watching" section
in the diary this week,
and you'll note the total
absence of black hawks.
That's mostly because
they're down. Sorry.

Also appearing: Daz,
Gaz, Paz and their pet
dog, Pooz. But seriously
(could you tell anyway?)
she's the next rising
thing for UK soul-pop.
Jazz Cafe, E10/E12 door
Mr Gone
Yes, yet another Jazz
Cafe concert, but I'm
including this one
because I'm going.
Hurray. It should be
jazzy, funky and fused.
