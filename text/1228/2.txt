Harlington Safe For Now
Harlington has been saved
from development for the new-
terminal at Heathrow, at least
for the time being. The news
comes after the leak of a confi-
dential government report to
the Financial Times recom-
mended that three n e w run-
ways be built i n south-east
England in order to meet pre-
dicted future demand for air
travel.
The release of the report last
month came after the approval
of a fifth Heathrow terminal by
the Secretary of State for
Transport, Stephen Byers, last
November. A s the largest and
busiest air travel hub i n the
world, it is widely believed
that the recommendations of
the report will inevitably lead
to the construction of a third
runway at the West London
airport, extending it to possi-
bly engulf land currently occu-
pied by the Harlington ground.
Widespread opposition
meant that it took twelve
years to gain approval for
Terminal 5, and as Harlington
lies in a designated 'green belt'
area, it will not be possible to
build such a commercial
development without a n
extensive planning battle,
meaning that there would
appear to be no immediate
threat to the medics' cherished
ground.
However, the government is
also looking at making
changes to planning proce-
dures with an aim of reducing
the amount of time spent on
appeal, which could mean that
development could take place
much sooner once planning
permission is eventually
sought. If Harlington is to be
lost, it will raise questions
about the sale of Teddington,
currently being discussed.
Nigel Buck, Assistant
Director of Estates, told Felix
that "the extent of the plan-
ning requirements for runway
three are as yet unknown" and
that while the timescale of
development cannot be fore-
cast, it could be almost a
decade before the land occu-
pied b y the ground would be
sought to extend Heathrow.
Sen Ganesh, Imperial
College Union President, said
that if College decided that it
would be desirable to sell both
Harlington a n d Teddington,
the Union would need to be
compensated for the loss, with
the money gained from the
sales being spent on student
sports facilities.
The College is looking close-
ly at the issue of sports provi-
sion for Imperial students, and
is in negotiations over a multi-
million pound n e w develop-
ment at Barn Elms in Putney in
addition to the proposed new
sports centre i n South
Kensington.

The 'Writing The Future'
scheme has been endorsed by
the Rector, and will replace

The timetable for this year's
Sabbatical elections has been
changed, after it was decided
that the opening of nomina-
tions had not been publicised
widely enough.
It was feared that the mini-
mal publicity for the elections
in the first week of the nomi-
nation period would limit the
number of good students
standing for positions, a n d
lead to a loss of confidence in
the those elected as
Sabbatical officers.
The nomination papers will
remain on the wall facing the
offices on the first floor of the
Union building until 5pm
today. For nominations to be
valid, candidates must be
backed up by the signature of
a proposer and twenty secon-
ders by this deadline.
Hustings for those standing
for the positions of President,
Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies), Deputy President
(Finance a n d Services),
Deputy President (Education
and Welfare), and Felix Editor
will now take place in the JCR
of the Union building at the
Wye campus on the evening of
Tuesday 26 February, a n d
then again in dBs in the Union
building of the South
Kensington campus on
Wednesday 27 February. This
will be followed b y voting
across all departments on
Thursday and Friday of that
week, with the results official-
ly declared i n the Union
Dining Hall, on the first floor of
the Union building, at 12noon
on Monday 4 March.
