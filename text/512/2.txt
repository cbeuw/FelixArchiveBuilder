Sir, - I would like to make a few
points on some of the ideas going
around I C at the moment; most of
these viewpoints are not new to
the College, but they all seem to
be more and more prevalent at
present.
It seems that many IC students
claim that h u m a n existence is
unrelated to any permanent,
changeless standards; in fact, I
think they mean that no such
standards exist at all, but rather
that everything is based on the
changeable beliefs and practices
of society. However, I don't
believe that these people have
really thought out what this
means: one inevitable consequen-
ce, for example, is that the whole
argument about H u m a n Rights
becomes a nonsense. It means that
we can only argue that, since our
'Western' governments think it's
rather nice for people to have lots
of freedoms, then we should all try
to force this bright idea onto the
nasty Russians, Chileans, etc!
N o w I don't believe this is what
people mean when they talk
about H u m a n Rights: they are
r e f e r r i n g to the i n t r i n s i c ,
inalienable rights of all h u m a n
beings, rights which exist without
reference to the conditions under
which anyone might be living. It's
worth adding here that these
Rights are challenged by all of us
in some way of other, because it is
very costly to give everybody
Rights - but that doesn't mean it is
good to oppress the weak to
reduce this cost to ourselves!
Another idea floating around is
that h u m a n beings are quite
unrestricted to do whatever they
want, any moral code being more
a matter of personal convenience
than of lasting utility. But this
view is quite unworkable in
practice. F o r example, men and
women can do many things that
are positively harmful to others -
e.g. stabbing passers-by to death
for the sake of it; or two near
blood-relations can conceive a
child by having intercourse,
thereby storing up almost certain
trouble for themselves, the child
and for society as a whole, just by
exercising their ability to commit
incest.
If anyone would like to live in a
society where no rules outlawing
such anti-social behaviour, then
they are unusual to say the least!
We need to have a certain amount
of laws to protect individuals and
society - though, of course, people
will generally disagree on how
extensive such legislation should
be. Some laws will have to extend
into the privacy of individuals (it
would be quite impossible to
prove many offences if courts
could not demand a witness to
reveal the contents of a secret
conversation, etc.) - but this need
should be assessed in terms of the
cost to individuals and to society
as a whole.
Just because men and women
are c o n s t r u c t e d ( p h y s i c a l l y ,
mentally and spiritually) so that
they can utilise their resources in
different (i.e. conflicting) ways
does not mean that one of those
ways is not better than all the rest.
T h e Welfare State can be used or
abused, but it was clearly
intended to be used properly and
so bring great relief to all sections
of the community. It is certain
that many people are out to grab
what they can , more than their
fair share, and so take away from
those in greater need. Y o u could
say such an attitude is just as good
as everyone accepting their fair
share, but such an attitude will
demolish the whole concept of the
Welfare State anyway!
M a n y people would say (in so
many words) that mankind is a
"cosmic accident". This implies
that h u m a n existence, having
begun by accident, must continue
in a like manner. Thus it would
seem foolish to try to do anything
definite (i.e. deliberately) since all
your actions must necessarily be
accidental! However, I don't
think many final-year students
are willing to accept this - as if
means that their attempts at
revision and their success or
failure in the exams are merely
accidents! Well, I know I'm not
the world's ideal student, but
even I hope to be able to answer
questions better if I bother to do
more revision - don't you!
Now, all these comments are
based on a simple consideration of
experience of human life. It has
not been necessary to go into any
obscure system of philosophy or
beliefs. As it happens, I have
personally applied these attitudes
to a system that includes all of
them; I do not believe that it is
possible to prove (scientifically or
philosophically) every aspect of
my faith from first principles
(otherwise I wouldn't be believing
in anything, I'd just be accepting
a set of facts) but I do believe that
it's very easy to justify my faith, in
terms of human experience and
conditions and the need for a fool-
proof solution to our problems. O f
course, I often have my doubts
about something or other; but I
have yet to be dissatisfied with
any of the reassurances I have
found in response to my doubts;
and it would seem that there are
always answers to my questions
( a l t h o u g h I d o n ' t o f t e n
understand much about these,
because, like the rest of humanity
- probably more so - I tend to be
rather thick: if I hadn't said it, you
would have!).
So what is this system of faith
that I hold to be true? - it is
centred around one man, a
carpenter by trade, whose life so
fascinates me that I have stared
for a long time at it. There is
nothing I have found to regret in
this man: there is everything I
have found that is good, pure and
attractive. T h e claims made by
this man make it very difficult to
ignore h i m - even if you think he
was mad , then it's a good idea to
think out some reasons, just in
case you get attracted to the
unusual things he claimed to be
able to offer!
So, why not accept the
challenge to take another look at
the man I have mentioned, just in
case there might be something of
value for your life? (His name is
Jesus of Nazareth, and he has
quite a few followers, even in IC!)

P.S. As I didn't mention a certain
Book even once, this letter may
prove of especial interest to y t u r
readers!
Dear Sir. - Please allow me to
reply to the letter by Kirsten Pratt
in last week's F E L I X .
T h e letter refers to menstrual
extraction in terms which make it
seem preferable to a 'normal'
abortion. It is not. A n abortion is
the killing of an unborn child,
however it is executed and
whether the time interval from
conception is one day, one week
or one month. W h e n a woman
uses this method of abortion, she
knows what she is doing: if she is
pregnant she is performing an
abortion, killing her child. The
major difference from a 'normal'
abortion is that with "heads being
thrown in buckets of bits of bodies" the
end result is more obvious.
Kirsten Pratt says that "80% of
abortions take place before 12 weeks,
when the baby is about 3" long with its
knees bent up". As well as knees
bent up the baby also has easily
distinguishable toes, fingers, ears
etc. Its appearance is little
different from that of a new-born
baby; in fact it resembles the new-
born baby more than the new-
born baby resembles an adult.
T h e fact that an unborn baby is
less developed than an adult is no
argument in favour of abortion, it
merely emphasises the fact that
life, from conception to death, is a
continuous process of change.
Concerning further points in
the letter, the issue is not one of
forcing a woman to have a child
or of denying a woman the right
to decide whether or not she has a
child. In all but a very small
minority of instances the woman
has chosen to take the risk. By the
time she is pregnant, the woman
has exercised her choice; she and
the father are fully responsible for
the life in her womb, and abortion
is simply an attempt at negating
that responsibility, the easy way
out. T h e existence of such an
escape route does not mean that it
s h o u l d be u s e d . I n s t e a d ,
assistance must be given the
woman in all ways possible to help
her cope w i t h p r e g n a n c y ,
childbirth and parenthood. The
father must be made to face his
responsibilities to mother and
child. If after its birth, the mother
decides that she cannot bring up
the baby then there are many
childless couples who would be
delighted to be able to adopt it.
For every child available for
adoption there are about 20
would-be adoptive parents.
O n the subject of rape, a
terrible crime of violence has been
committed against the woman
who may, as a result, be pregnant.
Unfortunately, the act of rape
cannot be undone; there is no use
pretending that it can, even to a
slight degree. It is sometimes
argued that an abortion can
reduce the trauma by relieving
the woman ofa constant reminder
of the horrible event. However, to
do this involves the killing of one
person. F r o m another point of
view, abortion is known to be a
traumatic experience in many
cases, and it may add to the
w o m a n ' s suffering. It also
increases the risk of any further
children the woman may have of
being born deformed. The major
point I would make, however, is
that noone has the right to deny
that child a continued existence.
It is the prevention of rape and the
c a r e , c o n s i d e r a t i o n a n d
acceptance which must be given a
woman who has been raped that
are important. Fortunately, rape
is rare and conception from it
even rarer.
Abortion should be seen as the
killing of an innocent h u m a n
being for the convenience of
others. T h e emphasis should be
on lessening the a p p a r e n t
inconvenience caused by the
child: on removing the prejudice
against unmarried mothers, the
handicapped and the illegitimate;
on providing the assistance,
financial or otherwise, that an
unmarried (or unwilling) mother
(or father) may need; o n
improving facilities and care for
the handicapped; on preventing
rape; on bringing children into a
society where they are all equally
accepted, loved and educated and
where none of them are made to
feel unwanted. Achieving such
ends will never be easy, but a
question is not answered by
rubbing it out. Abortion is the
easy way out, for parents and
society: it is not the right way.
Yours sincerely,

Dear Sir, - I would like to make a
comment on the editorial of the
'mourning cloud'. M a y I point
out that since J a n Czernuska is
non-existent, his 'threat to the
fabric of our society' is probably
also non-existent.
I therefore feel that the editor
could spend his and his readers'
time on more worthwhile topics.
Yours,
Jan Czernuszka
