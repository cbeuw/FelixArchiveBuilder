All agreed that increased food
costs should' now apply only to
the "food element" in the meal
price - about 0.56 per cent. The
difference Of opinion arose over
the calculation of the wage
inflation element.
P r o f e s s o r E i l o n ' s s c h e m e
involves a 1 per cent rise each
month to cover an alleged 20 per
cent increase in labour costs.
However, Mary Attenborough has
said that his method does not
account for increased turnover in
the refectories reducing the
increase in labour cost per meal.
She has proposed a 0.2 per cent
monthly price rise with a 1.3 per
cent increase at the beginning of
the financial year on 1st August.
This is based on an 8 per cent
wage settlement.
Mary Attenborough told a
FELIX reporter that she thought
Professor Eilon's scheme was
absurd. Prices could go up by 10
per cent in 5 months, which was
far more than necessary. |
She was angry that the meeting
was not allowed to vote on the
new scheme as Professor Eilon
said it was Executive action. But
the Committee did vote against
any termly price rise for next term.
The Union is taking no further
action until the Rector makes
known his views on the new
regulator.

FELIX is an IC Union Society as
well as a newspaper, following the
U n i o n Publication Board's
acceptance of a five-page FELIX
Constitution last Monday.
According to the Constitution
proposed by FELIX Editor John
Harris, the objects of the Society
are:
a) to aid the Editor in the
production of the paper
b) to provide for social activity
among those who help on the
paper
c) to make available to its
members knowledge and use of
the facilities of the Union Print
Unit.
T h e E d i t o r a n d B u s i n e s s
Manager, currently the only
officially existing FELIX posts, will
*be ex-officio members of thei
FELIX Committee which will
include eight other members
elected at the FELIX Annual
General Meeting early in the
summer term. The Editor and
Business Manager will continue
to be elected by the Union.
The Committee posts will be
H o n o r a r y S e c r e t a r y , S o c i a l
Secretary, News Editor, Sports
Editor, Reviews Editor, Photogra1
phic Rep., Media Rep. and one
ordinary member.
The Society is a separate entity
from the "FELIX C l u b " to which
members have to be elected by
the existing membership.
Several people have welcomed
the introduction of the FELIX
Constitution and expressed a
hope that it will provide the
framework for more students to
become involved in FELIX.

At 7.38, last Friday morning, Pete Hoddinot (RSM Hon. Sec.) fell 20 ft.
through a wired cast glass skylight, above a storeroom in Mines, and
landed on a pile ot asbestos which helped to break his fall. A few years
ago a French boy died falling through the same skylight.
Pete was late for a trip to an open-cast coal field organised by the Min
and Met Society. He had been told that astuffed goat had been hidden
on the other side of the wall that runs alongside Prince Consort Road.
He vaulted over the wall and crashed through the wired glass.
Peter Bamford 'phoned for an ambulance and was the first to reach
Pete. Mr. Hoddinot's face was covered in blood and there was a large
piece of glas protruding from just under his eye. Pete was in a state of
shock and was worried because he couldn't see. However Mr. Hoddinot,
renown for his strength on the rugby field, soon managed to recover
from the shock.
Pete was sent to St. Stevens hospital and had an operation last
Tuesday. After a short spell in intensive care he is now high-spirited and
eager to come back to col lege. He is expected to have left hospital by the
time FELIX is published and has had many visitors .... "almost all of
RSM" and several staff.
College Secretary Gives Lecture
Mickey Davies, the College Secretary, who has been at IC
since 1962 is to retire on 30th June this year.
O n Tuesday he gave an entertaining retirement lecture
entitled "In the company of scientists" in which he reminisced
about the years he has spent in the College.
In some respects things had changed little, he said. In 1962 I C U n i o n
was outside N U S , in 1979 likewise. Complaints about Mooney's chips
were the same then as now.
In 1962 the College budget was £3 million while in 1979 it had arisen
to £27 million, he continued. T h e 1978-9 income from tuition fees alone
was greater than the total College income in 1962.
Over the years he had seen an increase in staff and student
involvement in the College and more democracy. "Indeed we are now
living in a time of more democracy and less money which some would say is not a
very good combination".
T u r n i n g to the future he expressed concern over the College's income
and a desire for more flexible administration.
He concluded his talk with a quotation from W . H . Auden: "When in
the company of scientists I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into
a drawing room full of dukes."
NEWS IN BRIEF
M O R E S T R I P P E R S
T h e W o m e n in Science a n d
Technology group is to picket
Mines Revue on Thursday
because there will be strippers on
the bill.
Although both a male a n d
female stripper will be featured
the women feel that the presence
of a male stripper on this occasion
will make no difference to the way
in which such events degrade
women. W o m e n are still being
treated as sex objects, whereas a
single male stripper will not
change the attitude of men
towards each other. In any case
two wrongs do not make a right,
say W i S T .
A W i S T spokeswoman pointed
out that the advertisments for the
Revue depicted only a woman,
which showed what the event
organisers were really thinking
about.
T h e Revue will be in the Junior
C o m m o n R o o m a n d the women
will be picketing outside before
the 8.00 p.m. start. T h e group
have picketed R C S Smoking
Concert for the last few years in
protest against the presence of
strippers there.

study at Imperial College.
The scholarship would be
tenable for a one-year M . S c .
course. T h e College would waive
tuition fees, a n d money to cover
the student's living costs would be
raised from academics. T h e
