Once upon a time, on the third
ftoor of the Union building, there
lived a little man. His name was
Tiptoes, the laughing gnome.
Tiotoes led a lovely life. He
misspent his youth (well, his time
at IC anyway) by playing snooker
from dawn to dusk. Then, one day,
two devils from the land of
Maffstoo came into the snooker
lounge, and made his life a misery.
Within moments, the fluky shots
of one of these tormenters, Rastus
Odinga Odinga Odinga (who
c o m e s f r o m M a u r i t i u s , not
'Mauritious'), a n d the cheeky
comments of the other, U L U
Champ, soon made Tiptoes into a
festering cripple. N o more was he
the laughing gnome. Instead, the
snooker table became a battle-
ground, each pocket being just
small enough to keep him for
a m a s s i n g b i g b r e a k s . H i s
l a n g u a g e d e t e r i o r a t e d . H e
became short-tempered (though
whether he was ever long-
tempered is to be queried!)...
If you would like to see this
vicious little dwarf losing his
temper (probably at meforwriting
this article), and you are a
member of the snooker club, why
not come up on Wed. 14th March
to the Snooker club's Annual
General Meeting at 1.00 p.m. in
the Union TV Lounge.Nomination
papers for next year's committee
are now up in the snooker lounge,
and will be taken down on Mon.
12th March at 1 p.m.

W h e n y o u (as a D e b s o c M e m b e r ) s t a n d for the f o l l o w i n g
posts, here is a p p r o x i m a t e l y w h a t y o u are l e t t i n g yourself i n for:
C h a i r m a n
Does everything he/she can't get anyone else to do. This involves a
large amount of chasing people up - e.g. committee members and
prospective speakers. The chairman of Debating Society also sits on the
social, cultural and amusements board (SCAB) and gets involved as a n
'impartial co-ordinator' in such things as 'Welfare Day' and I C U
events such as last years N . U . S . Debate. This job may well be easier
next year now the society has a healthy membership and the
committee has well defined roles. The job is difficult but rewarding and
satisfying when a debate is a success. Have a G o !
M i c k Berry
Vice C h a i r m a n
Does most of everything that the C h a i r m a n instructs h i m to do. Has
to be prepared to deputize for the C h a i r m a n and do various tasks to
ensure the smooth running of the society. These tasks include all those of
the C h a i r m a n and so it is essential that you get on with next year's
Chairman. If interested and you feel that you could do a good job then
why not see me, and stand for the post.

T h e Other M a j o r Posts are!
Hon Sec
The H o n Sec is responsible for taking the minutes of meetings,
helping the treasurer collect memberships and writing letters to
prospective speakers.
Publicity Officer
Debsoc requires a lot of publicity lor events and therefore a good
publicity officer. If'you are willing to donate time to such a high position
in Debsoc then don't hesitate to stand.
Other Posts
There are eight other posts you might desire to stand for, which are
self-explanatory from their titles.
Papers are now up in the U n i o n Lower Lounge so join now (contact
M . Berry Maths II or come to our M o n d a y meetings at 12.30 Huxley
348) and stand for a post in Debsoc.
H o p i n g that you will push the membership into three figures (we
almost did).
W o u l d all members please contact The H o n Sec (Barry Austin -
Physics II) before Wednesday 14th M a r c h .
