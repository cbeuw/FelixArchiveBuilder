IC IV: LAKIN GOAL
CLINCHES POINTS
A goal in the dying seconds by IC IV wonder-captain Phil
Lakin was enough to ensure victory on Saturday by 24-0 against
Q E C II.
With four points at stake, the team felt that we needed an early
breakthrough and indeed this happened when Steve Marten
was fortunate to score in the fifth nano second of the (until then)
hotly contested league game.
Utility man, Steve Veats, surged through shortly afterwards to
sneak a second goal under the unfortunate Q E C goalkeeper.
Realising that if Steve Veats can score so can anyone, player
manager Paddy O'Kelly made a (very) deliberate run into the
penalty area and blasted a third past the depairing keeper.
Q E C came close to scoring
when Lakin mis-headed a
'clearance' and only a brilliant
save by agile Barry Witts in
goal foiled his attempt at
scoring.
Further goals were added
b y u n s t o p p a b l e J a m e s
Rowley - the IV's top scorer -,
Neil Catford, making an
i m p r e s s i v e d e b u t a n d
powerful Dave Higgs on loan
from IC II.
By half-time the score was
11-0 but the team were
warned, by ruthless manager
O'Kelly, not to slacken in the
second half. A target of a
further 11 goals was set and
the fourths started again in
mean mood, searching for
more goals.
Goals were flowing freely
until O'Kelly decided that he
wanted a hat-trick and that he
wasn't going to pass to
anyone until he got it. There
then followed a long period of
missed chances until finally
he put his third goal away.
Goalkeeper Barry Witts was
switched with two-goal hero
Steve Veats and rose to the
outfield challenge by scoring
a goal from a solo run starting
in his own half of the field.
Somewhere in between,
James Rowley had managed
to amass 5 goals and Steve
Marten an incredible 6! Neil
Catford also finished off his
debut hat-trick and the score
was 22-0 when we realised
that all four defenders had
failed to score. Hard man Bill
Caffyn (who before the match
had cast doubts on our ability
to win - well done Bill!) made
his way to a spot 30 yards from
the Q E C goal and waited for
the ball. The Q E C defence,
not wishing to incur his wrath,
passed the ball to him and he
thundered the ball intothetop
corner of the net for the 23rd
and best taken goal of the
game. Phil Lakin stole in for
the all-important 24th and
soon after, the ref blew the
final whistle.
It should be pointed out that
the 2 non-scoring defenders-
Giles Brereton and Neil Morris
- had decided that it would be
too embarrassing to score
only one goal so they decided
not to bother and were
content to contemplate the
meaning of life for most of the
match.
This is believed to be by far
the biggest league victory in
U L U history so well done IC IV
for winning their own place in
the annals of U L U soccer.
The fourths would also like to
point out that in achievingthis
result they scored one goal
every four minutes which
disproves a theory by'the old
man of football' J o h n Healy
and his right hand man poet-
Laureate Al Cable that no IC
IV player could run the length
of the pitch in less than five
minutes.
Scorers: Steve Marten (6),
James Rowley (5), Paddy
O'Kelly (3), Neil Catford (3),
Dave Higgs (2), Steve Veats
(2), Phil Lakin (1), Bill Caffyn
(1), Barry Witts (1).
Team: Witts, Morris, Caffyn,
Veats, Lakin, Brereton, Higgs,
Catford, O'Kelly, Marten,
Rowley.
IC 1st XI 2
GOLDSMITHS 0
IC went into this game
needing a win to keep up their
challenge for the p r e m i e r
division title a n d this was
expected to be a difficult
game. Goldsmith's are also
well placed i n the league a n d
on Saturday (10th M a r c h )
contest the cup final with
R H C .
I C took some time to settle but
managed to withstand G o l d -
smith's early attacks. After about
half an hour the game appeared
to be stagnating with neither side
getting the upper hand. T h e n
G r a h a m R i c k a r d received the
ball on the left wing, jinked past a
couple of Goldsmiths' defenders

GUY'S HOSP. 1st 9
I.C. Rugby travelled to the U . L . U . ground at M o t s p u r P a r k to
take on Guy's in the Final of the Gutteridge Plate Competition
and after a mediocre performance emerged clear winners by
the above scoreline.
O n inspecting the pitch we were amazed to find that the lines had
been laid down over the lines of a football pitch. This left criss-crosses of
white chalk everywhere and particularly-bad was the tr\ line where two
lines ran parallel one yard apart making it difficult to know whit h was
the correct line. This was to play quite a role in the match.
I.C. began disastrously - being it looked as if I.C. were going to
6 - 0 down within five minutes but
managed to pull things together
somewhat after Dave Lilley h a d
s c o r e d a n o p p o r t u n i s t t r y
following their_full back fumbling
a chip by Ronnie H o w a r d . This
was quickly followed by a penalty
goal from the boot of M a u r i c e
Cotter.
N o w that I.C. were in the lead
for the first time they produced
some of the best play seen in the
match. This culminated in a fine
team try finished off by Peter
Goring after some excellent back
up play. Before this Eddy Budgen
had put over a really 'monster'
drop goal.
The second half saw Guy's
immediately increase their score
with a penalty kick and for a time
crack.
This was not to be because a
further try a n d conversion by
Cotter elevated the score beyond
Guy's reach. This was another
good try with a d u m m y scissors
putting J o h n Chanceller through
and leaving Cotter to finish off.
Just after this M a u r i c e added
another penalty to notch up the
above total.
However, the score would have
been more if yours truly had not
downed the ball on the soccer line
when seemingly through to a n
easy try.
Thanks very much to all those
who came along to support us, by
the way!

IC 1st XI
UCH 0
IC overcame their recent
loss of three points to R H C i n
a double-header (notice how
defeats are never reported),
with a good w i n over a rather
poor hospital side. This result
leaves t h e m with an outside
chance o f winning the U . L .
league, though it is now
e s s e n t i a l t o w i n t h e
remaining games. H a v i n g
already defeated this team 5 -
1 earlier this season IC were
not expecting too m u c h
difficulty a n d this overconfi-
dence showed i n the early
part of the game.
Some good moves were put
together from tbe start with Rutty
attempting to score by booting
both ball and goalkeeper into the
net. U C H came back well a n d
Tsoukkas h a d to make an
extrovert diving save to push
away a shot from the U C H centre
forward. I C ' s early confidence
began to wane as the game moved
on with no score in their favour.
However after half-time the game
changed completely as the I C
players realised they now had the
wind at their backs (not a
reference to Phil Brindle's turd
fetish). It was not long before the
first goal went in as Paver,
remembering at last to keep his
head down when he shoots, rifled
home a low, hard shot to give the
U C H keeper no chance. After this
first goal the opposition folded up
and I C began lo play with a lot
more confidence. Further goals
came from Brindle (2) a n d
Johnson, though the final score
should certainly have been higher
than 4-0.
Team: Tsoukkas; Rutty, Reeve,
Paver, Kenrick, Black, Johnson,
Davies, Rickard, Brindle, Stevenson.
