ALL THE EDITOR'S MEN
FELIX Financing- The Full Story
The Union has forced F E L I X to drastically reduce printing
charges and completely revise its own estimates for next
year's expenditure following accusations of profiteering on
printing jobs.
John Shuttleworth, one of the three candidates in next week's
election for F E L I X Editor, published a campaign broadsheet
" F l L E - X " last Friday in which he accused successive F E L I X
Editors and Business Managers of m a k i n g a 500 per cent profit
on offset-litho printing instead of breaking even as people had
been led to believe. He also claimed that F E L I X was ruled by a
" F E L I X Club Clique".
The L i b e r a l Club newspaper F O R W A R D ! not unexpectedly
took up the story on Ttresday this week and published the
results of their own detailed investigation.
The Print U n i t has always charged for paper, plates, extras and
machine time, the latter being the cost of paying the litho operator.
However, F E L I X itself has only had to pay for paper, the other costs
being paid by College.
This has given rise to huge profits. For example the F E L I X accounts
for the last six months o f l 978 show an income of£l ,521 from offset-litho
printing and do not mention expenditure on plates or machine time.
However, when F E L I X Business Manager Dave Crabbe submitted
his estimates for next year he claimed an income of only £550 on
printing and typesetting jobs and asked for a U n i o n grant of£2,800. A
further income of £1,200 from advertising meant that the total
expenditure by F E L I X was estimated at £4,550.
J o h n Shuttleworth was not the down to the cost of paper plus a
only person to suspect that
something was wrong. I C Liberal
C l u b had long suspected that
charges were too high and U n i o n
President M a r y Attenborough
had also seen the discrepancy
between the accounts and the
estimates. She had t
a m e e t i n g of
queried this at
I C U n i o n
P u b l i c a t i o n s B o a r d , b u t
Publications Board C h a i r m a n
J o h n Allen was unable to take up
the matter fully before the story
broke.
John A l l e n said that he had
been aware of the profit being
made. H e showed me copies of
estimates prepared by Dave
Crabbe for both F E L I X and the
I C U n i o n Handbook, in which a
£450 sum for printing the
Handbook did not appear as
income in the F E L I X estimates.
After the publication of F I L E -
X a U n i o n Finance Committee
meeting cut printing charges
50p profit margin for the U n i o n ,
clubs and societies. This will only
take effect next session so that
F E L I X does not face sudden
f i n a n c i a l d i f f i c u l t i e s n o w .
Individuals, apart from election
candidates, will still face higher
charges.
Because the hidden income will
no longer be available, F E L I X is
now claiming a £3,571 grant from
the U n i o n , the true cost of
producing F E L I X now being put
at £5,321.
A meeting of Publications
Board on M o n d a y decided to set
up an equipment fund for the
Print U n i t to pay for new
machinery formerly financed out
of F E L I X profits. Profit from
outside printing and typesetting
jobs would enter this fund which
will be used firstly to replace the
litho unit.
Publications Board also heard
that F E L I X had agreed to pay
back £400 into the Publications
B o a r d reserve a c c o u n t to
compensate for overcharging on
this year's I C U Handbook.
O n e of the people at the centre
of the row is ofcourse the F E L I X
Editor J o h n Harris. He told me
that he had cooperated w i t h j o h n
Shuttleworth and the other
investigations because the matter
had been weighing heavily on his
conscience for some time. H e had
been bothered by it since last term
but had not done anything
"because it seemed easier to perpetuate
the system than to fight to change it".
T o the best of his knowledge J o h n
Shuttleworth's allegations were
completely true.
One of the principal accused is
D u n c a n Suss, last year's Editor
and formerly Business Manager.
H e denied having personally
increased the printing rates at the
end of 1976 as he had at that time
resigned as Business Manager.
But, he explained, the charges
had gone up because Clive
D e w e y , t h e n E d i t o r , h a d
overspent his budget and was
heading for a £1,000 deficit. The
U n i o n had set the high charges to
o v e r c o m e C l i v e D e w e y ' s
overspending.
He went on to say that it did not
matter what F E L I X charged
clubs and societies because the
printing costs were reflected in the
grant they got from the U n i o n
and the money was all coming
from the C o l l e g e a n y w a y .
Printing costs outside College
were at least twice as high.
The surplus cash had all been
put to excellent use, he continued.
F E L I X had acquired a camera,
p l a t e m a k e r a n d a p h t o -
typesetter,ad vastly improved the
quality of work produced and
saved the U n i o n from having to
go to commercial concerns. He
e s t i m a t e d t h a t t h e n e w
equipment was saving the LJnion
up to £2,000 per year.
H e denied that F E L f X was
controlled by a F E L I X C l u b
Clique pointing out that F E L I X
C l u b was only a social club. H e
hoped J o h n Shuttleworth would
apologise for some of his
statements.
The m a i n outcome of the row is
the reduction in printing charges.
T h e issue has overshadowed all
others in the election for F E L I X
Editor as both J o h n Shuttleworth
and D a v i d Crabbe are candidates
for the post - the third is C o l i n
Palmer. J o h n Shuttleworth's
allegations of control by a F E L I X
C l u b Clique have been followed
by accusations that the U n i o n is
trying to take over F E L I X .
Nobody has been accused of
personal gain or corruption, only
of obtaining money for F E L I X by
covert means. It is' to be hoped
that F E L I X has not suffered
unduly and that everyone will
benefit from the matter being
cleared tip.

P R O P O S A L S
A staggering 20 per cent
refectory price rise per year could
result from a new regulator
proposed by Refectory Commit-
tee Chairman Professor Eilon.
But Union President Mary
Attenborough has written a paper
which argues that a much smaller
price rise could cover Increased
wage costs. And the Rector has
said that no new scheme will be
applied until he is fully satisfied
that it is justified.
Refectory Committee met on
Thursday last week to draw up a
formula for a new regulator which
could up prices in line with
increases in both food and wage
costs, following protests by
Imperial College Union over the
way the regulator is currently
applied.
