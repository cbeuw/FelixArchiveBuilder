"The Deer hunter" (X, director Michael
Cimino) is such a film that its theme is
established in its opening shot. A massive
juggernaut thunders past the camera out of
shot; in the background are the blast furnaces
of a Pennsylvanian steel mill. As surely as the
juggernaut arrives so will the effects of
Vietnam, and not just on those who are
enlisted.
Robert de Niro plays Michael, who along
with close friends Nick and Stephen, is
scheduled for a tour of duty of Vietnam.
Before they leave their loves and a
community steeped in ethnic solidarity and
comradship, they go on one last deer hunt
together. Michael emerges as the leader, hard
stubborn and rational. "One shot is what it's
all about; the deer has to be taken with one
shot". The piano playing afterwards, as they
relax is slowly but surely drowned by the
sound of helicopter blades. Then in a
marvellous edit we cut to the horrors of war
and the waste of human life.
E r n e s t H e m i n g w a y w r o t e in his
introduction to the anthology 'Men at War' the
following "...when you have read this you will
know that there are no worse things to be
gone through than men have not been,
through before". The three, now reunited,
Robert de Nero as Michael
swap the horrors of war for the horrors of a
Viet C o n g prisoner camp. With rythmic
editing of close-ups, a game of Russian
Roulette is performed; The prisoners as
pawns and the captors as gamblers. The
barrel is spun and clasped. With one bullet in
the gun the prisoner holds it up to his temple.
If it goes off, you witness an explosion and the
ripping apart of the human head. Such is the
film-powerful and direct.
This game is the underlying thread
throughout - culminating in Michael trying to
save Nick. In a chaotic Saigon, he faces Nick
across the other side of the table having
bought his way into the game. 'Remember
Nick, is this what you really want? It only
takes one bullet, remember Deer Hunting'.
It is no coincidence: whilst we witness a
gun firing into a temple, it is war that is
destroying the minds of the young men.
T h e Deer Hunter' is about the way war
affects the individual and changes his life.
Back home, Michael, in the second deer hunt
and the splendour of the scenery, cannot
even bring himself to kill the deer. Meryl
Streep, already widely praised for her portrali
of Nick's girl friend Linda, sums everything up
when she says 'Did you ever think it would
turn out like this?'
Michael in the horrors of Vietnam
Director Michael Cimino, this being only
his second venture as writer-director of a
major motion picture, gives u s a s c o p e o f time
and place. Interlaced is a steel mill town, with
a stark skyline that juts up from the wooded
hills, and the battlefield of Vietnam. Only
Michael survives intact from the horrors,
pulling together the strands of his life.
Robert de Niro, as the hard-living/hard-
working steelworker achieves a brilliant
performance. No other actor goes into such
meticulous detail to capture a character. Also
outstanding are Christopher Walkin, as Nick
who loses contact with his background,
Meryl Streep who made her film debut in
'Julia' , and John Savage who plays Steven:
'It has nothing to do with whether we should
or should not have been in Vietnam. It's just
about guys who are touched by War'.
The film is a sad indictment for the human
race but a tribute to the courage of the
individual. Nick tells Michael before they
leave 'Don't leave me over there' and he
didn't: except that Nick was dead. A
destroyed mind was blown away by one shot-
that's what it's all about.

T E N P I N BOWLING
T H E A l T O S O U T H A M P T O N
After spending a couple of weeks
struggling to arrange a team of nine to
bowl at Southampton last weekend,.
hectic activity at the last minute (OK
I ' m exaggerating) meant that two
teams travelled down on Saturday. Was
it worth the journey and all the hassles?
Overall, yes, with the first t e a m coming
away with a few trophies and some
good individual performances.
T h e Southampton Trios were based on
teams of nine; six men and three ladies.
Every one bowled one series in either a men's
or ladies' trio and then another series in a
mixed trio (two men and one lady). Late
entrants (ourselves) and late arrivals (not us
for a change) made lane allocations difficult
for the organizers, but on the whole they
coped well, despite numerous machine
breakdowns and stoppages.
Most of the L o n d o n teams found problems
in adapting to the lanes at Bitterne. This is a
c o m m o n handicap for those who generally
bowl at Tolworth, where the conditons on the
lanes are different from just about every other
centre in Britain. In particular, Edgar F u n g
took a couple of games to control his hook and
find a good line, rolling a 74 first game. It was
not until the sixth and final game that T u b b y
Woo, with a 230, and Brian M a c G o w a n ,
with a personal best 226, reached their best;
with E d m o n d Ng's tournament high-game of
235, L o n d o n had the best three individual
games of the tournament, an excellent
achievement.
T h e t e a m b o w l i n g w a s m o r e
disappointing, apart from the A l team
winning the men's trios section convincingly.
T h e team of E d m o n d Ng, with a 588 series,
Albert Wong, and T u b b y Woo, with 533,
well deserved their victory, emphasising the
strength of London's first team. E d m o n d
Ng's 588 series was the second best of the day,
but an inconsistent second series, including a
99 game, took away any hopes of victory in
the men's tournament average competition.
However T u b b y Woo, with a fine 557, giving
a tournament average of 182 came second,
the winner averaging 189.
The uneven team bowling brought the
London A team only third place, well behind
Southampton and Burnel. T h e B team came
ninth and last and will refuse to discuss this
result with anyone.
learns: London A: Edmond .\~g, Albert Wong,
Tubby Woo, Roland Hsie, Joe ,\'g, Danny Law,
Ida Eok, Louisa Lau, Ruby Wong.
Total pinfall: 8047
London H: Brian MacGowan, Peter Churchyard,
Edgar Fung, Tim Hillyer, Joe Wong, Jackie
Ladder, Su Tick, EuFu Salavalian, Dela Wong
Total pinfall: 6737
M o r e g o o d news: i n the E x c e l
Championship, the House Championship of
the Charrington Bowl, Tolworth, held
recently, Tubby Woo came third and R o l a n d
Hsie came sixth, two excellent performances.
The I n t c r - C C U championship will be held
on Wednesday 21st M a r c h and will be run
on a trios basis. Each C C U will have two
teams, one made up from bowlers in the
C l u b , the other from C C U stars. T h e C l u b
A G M will be held the same day at Tolworth,
so the minibus will leave a little earlier. M o r e
details next week.
