BBC Struggle to Follow STOIC
Initiative!!!
The B B C are at present
experiencing industrial unrest
due to their staff's opposition to
E N G (Electronic News Gather-
ing). Until recently most of the
B B C ' s n e w s m a t e r i a l w a s
recorded on film, but they have
started to record news on video
tape (ENG) and this is threatening
some of their employees with
redundancy (e.g. Film processing
staff).
STOIC have been using E N G
for several years now without
e x p e r i e n c i n g a n y i n d u s t r i a l
unrest, except, possibly, on cold
Saturday morning rag collections.
The new colour television for
the Southside Lower TV Lounge
has arrived and will be installed as
soon as possible.

David Cobham Won't Like Your
Lab Report
Well, probably not. Anyway,
David is really interested in what
you think of his new film.
This latest full-length feature
film is T a r k a The Otter'-reviewed
on S T O I C a fortnight ago. It
depicts the life story of Tarka, and
as such is the first film to totally
involve animals as the stars.
Because of this, it has been
assumed by the media to be a
'Childrens Film' - which is in fact
totally untrue.
To correct this, and to see what
sensible, mature students think of
it, David has sent us 70 free tickets
for a promotional showing, so this
is your chance to seethe film free
and talk to the man who produced
and directed it.
The showing will be on Friday
16th March at 127, Waldour Street
(Rank Films Distribution Centre).
A reception has been organised
before (7.00for 7.30) and afterthe
film.
Z o o l o g i s t s or s i m i l a r are
especially welcome as David is
particularly interested in howthey
view the film.
To get your ticket, drop into the
TV studios (Elec Eng 208) on the
walkway at lunchtime, or contact
Paul Johnson Elec. Eng. 2.
Last weekend, members of I.C.
Radio Society operated their
short-wave station, G5YC, in the
ARRL DX contest; the aim of the
event being to contact as many
American and Canadian amateurs
as possible in a 48-hour period.
This involved a lot of hard work for
all involved; ana being up at rather
unsociable hours for the few
keener members of the club
willing to volunteer for the early
morning shifts.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y , t e e t h i n g
troubles with their new 2 kilowatt
linear amplifier forced the station
to operate at reduced power for
the first 12 hours of the contest.
This meant that the society was
not in the running for the top
p l a c i n g s , b u t t h e y w e r e
nevertheless able to make a very
respectable 1,222 contacts.
In spite of the difficulties, the
event was a great success, with
radio conditions at their best for
many years: mainly due to the
approaching sunspot maximum.
The experience gained by the
society's newer operators should
prove useful for next year's
contest, in which they hope to be
more competitive.
Signal reports received from
American stations were always
excellent, and it would seem that
the club has now regained its
Former reputation of being "the
strongest signal out of Europe."
The contest was well covered
by college media, with "up to the
minute" coverage by I.C. Radio,
and video taping by S T O I C , to be
used in aforthcoming programme
f e a t u r i n g t h e a c t i v i t i e s of
R A D S O C .
The society's next important
event will be the operation of a
demonstration station at I.C. Fete.
