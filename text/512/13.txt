N o w to less serious things, O n Saturday the i n t e r - C . C . U . M o n o p o l y
took place to which 35 Guildsmen, 11 r.c.s. and no miners turned up
and spent most of the day dashing round all the real places on the
monopoly Board, solving clues and collecting for Rag. I was thoroughly
knackered even though I gave up at 2.00 p.m. Guilds collected ,£149
with more cans still to come at the time of writing.
The Election Bar Night on Sunday was a thoroughly boozy and noisy
affair with plenty of yards drunk (not necessarily well), boat races raced
and songs sung.
By now the i n t e r - C . G . U . S w i m m i n g G a l a will be over. If we won,
congratulations to those who took part, if we lost commiserations. I'll
have more to say about that next week.

At Paris with N-S vulnerable, the bidding goes: -
E. S. W. N .
1H IS 2 C ' Pass
2 D 2S Double Pass
Pass Pass
East has a 7 loser hand with two good 5 card suits and is justified in
opening 1 H . South comes in with a standard overcall and west simply
bids his 5 cards club suit, forcing for one round. East shows his
diamonds, but then south, a big mouth from Texas, gets carried away
and bids 2S - a carve bid. N o w West, at first tempted to bid 3 N T and
so score 400 for the game, sees a chance to double and take two offfor
500.
N o w study the hands for a while to see how the defence should go.
West leads A and K of clubs, then 9 of clubs asking for a heart return.
East, in with the ruff, must think before returning a low heart. The 10
brings out the Q , and when west bets in with the K of spades he returns
the 4 of hearts to East, who cashes A of diamonds before returning A
heart to promote West's 10 of spades (an uppercut).
W i t h this defence E - W take 7 tricks and score 500 for a well deserved
top.
