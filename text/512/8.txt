There are many areas where more union
work needs to be done.
O n accommodation, College should
part with its ^million or so invested in stocks
and shares and purchase property lor turning
into student residence with the resulting
income from rents replacing the invested
income. This would go a long way to solving
our accommodation crisis.
O n indoor sports, College should oiler
land free for building a new University of
L o n d o n Indoor Sports H a l l (either Northside
or next to Chemistry). This would provide
facilities for sports such as badminton and
basketball.
O n refectories, continued pressure
should be put on College to operate a better
and cheaper service, and I believe the U n i o n
ought to consider running a snack bar itself
O n tuition fees, the College should set up
a hardship fund to cover hardship arising
from increases, which would also cover all
areas of financial hardship.
O n careers, far more people should be
encouraged to make use of the Prestel careers
data service at College, and we should rectify
the fact that the University is presently
understaffed with regard to full-time careers
advisors.
O n entertainments, we should ensure
that we can use the Great H a l l regularly for
concerts.
O n . a c a d e m i c s t a n d a r d s , some
departments should look far more closely at
applicants' individual aptitude for particular
courses, to try to cut down failure rates.
I have sat on both the Academic a n d
External Affairs Committees, a n d been
C h a i r m a n , IC Postgraduate Group
(I'm a Botany PG). A m o n g other things, I ' m
now C h a i r m a n , IC Union Council and on
the College Governing Body.
Vote for the person with most experience
and ability to deal with a variety of union
work and with the enthusiasm to investigate
the widespread needs of I C students. I hope
you will agree, that is me!

A n undergraduate student of Chemistry
T h e reason I think that 1 should be elected
President of I C U is that I have proven
experience in administration coupled with
awareness of A L L sides of college life giving
me a balanced view of the Union.
I C U , whilst representing I C students at a
college (and National) level, has, periodically
taken itself too seriously. Social life IS
important. But no single facet is A L L
important.
I am the only candidate capable of taking
this viewpoint with enough perspective. I
can make I C U more representative o f
IC students.
The issues which I feel have particular
importance and relevance to students are;
Welfare
Accommodation
Refectories
IC Ents
Fees
Grants
Employment
A l l these have different problems a n d
implications and no one should be dealt with
to the exclusion of any other.
As well as daily administration a n d
representation I believe that the U n i o n
should enter more fully into the services-type
role. Possible areas lor this expansion are;
Foreign Exchange Week - A separate
scheme, run o n the same lines as Foreign
Students Week in R S M , but open to all I C
students. This could not be set up in one year
but I would like to start this as a long term
project.
J C R Stalls - I would like to encourage more
and different stall holders offering genuine
reductions.
Discount Scheme - This has been suggested
as a job for the D P whom I w ill support and
help in this difficult venture.
I ask you to support my campaign.
V O T E C H R I S F O X - 1
For a more Representative. Balanced.
