The last two editors have worked hard to
equip the Office with the facilities needed to
produce F E L I X independently and at a high
standard with variation of typeface, layout
and appearance. The next Editor must
produce a newspaper worthy of these efforts
and expenditure.
T o do this efficiently and effectively more
people must be welcomed to work on F E L I X .
I believe the interest is there but â€¢
encouragement has been lacking. It's
necessary for an Editor to spend some time
each week on organising and co-ordinating
his stall'.
Most regular contributors have said they
intend to get more involved next year. No-
one will be discouraged.
If only a few people contribute regularly
the paper seems the same every week and gets
criticised for lack of ideas and variety.
A l l the present F E L I X stall' would be
happy to work with me next year and this is a
good base to build on.
I have experience with the equipment in
use and the techniques used in production,
and I feel confident thai I would do well if I
found myself in charge.
Barring any majoi breakdowns I can't see
why F E L I X should slip below I (> good pages.
I wouldn't relish leaving out a m article
merely because spa' e is tight. I don't foresee
too much problem with layout provided
things are organized properly and I know I'm
capable of doing this. It's not noimc to be easy
and I intend to earn my Sabbatical by
eonsciencious hard work and dedication with
drive, imagination and enterprise.
Y o u ' d be shocked to find F E L I X change,
so I'll warn you it will be different but I'll
keep some of the "trademarks" of this sear
since I see next session as a continuation and
not a restart.
I'm looking forward to being Y O U R
Editor so don't disappoint me.

If elected. I will pursue policies which
make F E L I X reflect the varied interests and
activities of all I C students. T o do this, I will
introduce:
- more student and department news;
- regular 'events' features;
- supplements on post-College life e.g. house
purchase, careers, holidays
I believe in full use of inventive layout,
cartoons and photos to produce a visually
appealing F E L I X : nobody enjoys reading a
paper that looks boring.
Information is needed for news and
features, and I have already approached
clubs and Dep. Reps, about the possibility of
a " F E L I X R E P R E S E N T A T I V E " in each
club and department. These ambitious, but
realistic, ideas require staff, so I will make the
Office atmosphere more sociable. Cheers!

T o p e r f o r m this d e m a n d i n g job
successfully, the Editor must have certain
essential abilities. He must he technically
competent; he must understand fully the
operation of Offset L i t h o and the ancillary
equipment and the production of F E L I X -
everything. H e must be able to attract and
keep staff throughout the year. It is also useful
if he is a competent writer and is familiar with
many of the personalities of U n i o n and
College.
I believe D A V I D C R A B B E fulfills these
criteria far better than any other candidate.
In his three years at Imperial, he has been
F E L I X News Editor (1976 - 77), last year's
IC U n i o n Handbook Editor (which made full
use of the new equipment, was the biggest
yet. and had the most inventive designs of any
recent U n i o n Handbook) and is1
currently
F E L I X Business Manager (which involves
making sure F E L I X doesn't overspend).
David has also attended Council and U G M ' s
and is a member of Publications Board. H e
has not only experience and proven ability,
but ideas, inventiveness arjd dedication. I am
absolutely certain that

I'm keen to see next year a well organised,
effective and widely supported U n i o n . It is
the role of our U n i o n to look after our
welfare, interests and to provide the
opportunity lor an active social life.
This comes down to a concern lor each
individual and what each of us looks for in
our years here. I sec the H o n . See's role as
one of two-way communication and
organisation. Hence as well as coordinating
U n i o n Affairs he should be approachable and
socially active. H e must be on hand to carry
out the daily work required in the office but
also anxious to continually widen the scope
and outlook of the U n i o n .
The know ledge I have gained as this year's
I C U Academic Affairs Officer will be
invaluable. Throughout I have shown the
sense of purpose and personal involvement
needed to get results. As my work dealt with
all areas of College I'm also aware of the
dependence on communication. M y two
years here have given me the belief that our
Exec, must be personally interested and
concerned in all aspects of college life. As
editor of the Alternative Prospectus I've
shown I'm capable of that!
Two points! Publicity for U G M ' s must go
hand in hand with encouraging everyone 10
submit motions; U G M ' s must be maae worth
attending. Secondly I would take an interest
in any problems facing Clubs and Societies
offering assistance where ever possible.
What I can oiler as H o n . Sec. is based on a
clear insight of what the job entails. 1'hus, I
know very well of the routine tasks and the
dedication needed to carry them out
efficiently with m i n i m a l fuss. I have the
experience, initiative and enthusiasm to do
the job well.
Roger Stotesbury.
