Lovely Boys.
Simon Lewis goes to the London Palladium's screaming success.
La Cage is a music, light
and costume extravaganza,
entertaining with a visual
display that makes the
Lloyd-Webber musicals
seem tacky by comparison.
Arthur Laurents, the
Director, who's written
work includes West Side
Story and The Turning
Point, has recreated the
stuff that the dream movies
of the 50's were made of. If
showbiz razzle is desired
then La Cage will fulfil your
every desire.
The story is plain
enough, involving the love
of man for man, George for
Albin (Dennis Quilley,
George Hearn) and it's
effect on the love of man
for woman, Jean-Michel for
Jacqueline (Jonathan
Morris, Wendy Roe).
Centered around a Gay
Riviera club, Jean,
George's son, falls in love
with the daughter of a
reactionary politician.
When the time comes for
future in-laws to be
introduced, Jean is
adament that his fiance's
parents should not meet
the two men who have
raised him; his thoughtless
attitude results in a
multitude of problems for
George who must explain
to Albin why after twenty
years he is required to
leave his home; eventually
Albin is ousted for a 'real'
woman. However, at the
last minute, total chaos
results when she fails to
turn up for the parental
encounter. Albin initially
saves the day by posing as
Jean's mother, until
inevitably he is found out
by Jacqueline's father. Not
surprisingly, as might be
expected from any musical,
all the problems
encountered are worked
out by the finale, and those
who deserve to live happily
ever after, do!
'Our baby is getting
married! Where did we go
wrong...Snakes live man
and woman together, Cats
live man and woman
together, we are humans!'
Quilley and Hearn are
polished and understated,
and avoid the pitfalls of
stereotyping the characters
they play. Particularly
memorable is the moment
where George tries to teach
Albin how to be 'straight',
although it seems that
George's efforts are fated
from the start!
The supporting role of
'Les Cagelles' (The Chorus)
links the scenarios together
with grace, and the entire
'Line' exude talent and
energy. The question of
their true gender is left
until the finale!
La Cage is not a classic
musical in the sense of
West Side Story or 42nd
Street, the musical
numbers are not of the
same calibre. However, the
costumes and sets are
magnificant, and they must
be seen since a description
would undoubtedly not do
them justice. No expense is
spared.
Although billed in some
publications as a
heterosexual love story, La
Cage presents two middle
aged people who have
spend twenty years of their
lives together. The core of
this amusing musical is
their love for each other.
This does much to present
a more positive image of a
community that is
constantly put down by the
media. La Cage is a
celebration of their
emancipation.

Pete Wilson plays with the Yuppies new toys.
An Invitation to Windham
Hill
(distributed by A&M)
I listened to it on my
Walkman while going
'round Sainsburys. It was
great; I felt like I was in a
movie, and, at any moment
I would crash my trolley
into the girl of my dreams.
Our eyes would meet and
we'd have a whirlwind
romance before one of us
dying of cancer. And all the
time An Invitation to
Windham Hill plays in the
background. I didn't crash
my trolley into anyone, but
then how much can you
expect from an LP?
Windham Hill began
modestly in 1976, an artist
owned record label
releasing instrumental
music which does not fit
easily into the jazz, rock or
folk categories. In 1976 one
record was released in a
pressing of 300. In 1985
Windham Hill realised sales
in excess of one million.
An Invitation to Windham
Hill is a collection of ten
titles from seven of the
artists currently on
Windham Hill. Michael
Hedges, who recently
supported Suzanne Vega in
London, deserves a
mention for his 'unusual'
guitar technique. According
to Capital Radio he is
going to be big in the UK.
Also worth a mention is
Mark Isham and William
Adverman, who started the
label in the first place.
It is perhaps not fair to
try to pick out high points
of this album, as it is
consistently good,
consistently virtuoso. I
hope we shall hear more of
Windham Hill in this
country in the future.
