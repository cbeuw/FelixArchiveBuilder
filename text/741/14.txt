SWIMMING AND WATER-POLO
Annual Report
At the AGM held on
Wednesday 14th one of the
most important points
noted was that although
competitive success had
not been frequent in the
last season there had been
a notable rise in club
morale which bodes well
for next year. The retiring
club captain Paul
Richardson noted that this
was evidenced by a larger
core of members who
attended training sessions
regularly, unlike the
previous season at which
point it was thought the
club would fold.
The most notable swim
of the year was recorded
by Dave Brocklebank in the
ULU championships when
he lowered the university
record to 72.45 for the
100m breaststroke. One
other notable result was
Imperial's eighth place in
the UAU Mens Long
Course Championship held
at Blackpool. Our
outstanding event was the
4x100m relay in which Ian
Riddle, Dave Brocklebank,
Rob Eastman and Graeme
Johnston came sixth
overall, beating arch rivals
Loughborough. This result
was enough to relegate a
stronger UCL team into
tenth place in the entire
event which was eminently
satisfying for our five man
team. Due to the lack of
swimming competition no
colours were awarded.
The water-polo team
were the most active side
of the club this season,
reaching the finals of the
UAU championships and
finishing fifth in the country
with a depleted side.
Throughout the university
season as well as the
Middlesex League we have,
shown that we have the
talent to suceed if not the
finishing touches or
consistency that is
required. Next year should
prove the testing ground
with several players leaving
including Rob Eastman
who was awarded a special
prize in recognition of his
help with the team and the
gaining of his first English
International Cap. The new
captain, Dave Wall, noted
that club confidence was
rising and this coupled with
a good season would pay
dividends in the long run.
To emphasize this point
the water-polo team
thrashed the national Royal
Navy side 13-7 last Friday
proving to all critics that
the club as a whole is in
the ascendent and looking
forward to a very
prosperous new academic
season. Early on the writing
was on the wall for the
Navy side as Imperial
pulled away steadily
leading 6-2 at half time
from goals by Rob
Eastman, Steve Davis and
Paul Richardson. Although
the navy tried to
consolidate serious holes in
their defence were
consistently being
punished by Johnston and
Williams with the finishing
power of the Spooner twins
overwhelming the visitors
in the second half.
The following colours
were awarded to the water-
polo team:-
Half Colours Jim Crowder,
Full Colours Steve Davis,
Paul Richardson, Dave
Brocklebank, Graeme
Johnston, Rob Eastman,
Nigel Williams.
STAFF CRICKET
Here It
Is Jim!
IC staff cricket club
(ICSCC) began their
defence of the Mid-Kent
County Championship with
a narrrow win over Bridon
at Barnehurst. I C S C C
elected to bat but high
winds and lack of match
practice contributed to a
disasterous batting collapse
which found them at 21 for
6. Only an excellent 87 run
partnership between K
Buckley and A Dengel
saved the innings. Bridon
threatened to overtake IC
easily after a brisk start, but
accurate bowling by J
Baben and the fielding of C
Gordon off M Masento
retrieved the match.
Bridon's innings was closed
when R Blench, a name to
watch in the future,
uprooted Maitlands middle
stump in a race against
deepening gloom leaving
I C S C C winners by 14 runs.
I C S C C is open to all staff
and postgrads at IC and
welcomes new players. If
interested contact A Dengel
int 4637
I C S C C 143 (K Buckley 59,
A Dengel 41, Collier 5-27)
Bridon 129 (Mace 34, J
Baden 4-12, M Masento 3-
32)
CYCLING
Revision And
Punctures
Most of Cycling club are
currently busy revising for
exams, but never-the-less
two members competed in
a 25 mile T T last Saturday,
in an event organised by
Southend and Country
Wheelers, at Witham,
Essex. In overcast
conditions, but on mainly
dry roads, Wayne Morley
achieved a time of 1 hour, 5
mins and 57 sees, beating
his personal best by almost
three minutes. Matthew
Whitaker punctured just
after the start and so
produced a time of 1-17-04.
The event was won by D
Bedford of Wig more C C in
a time of 1-0-28. Scott
Heyhoe and Peter
Hartiagan were also in
action last Saturday,
competing in a 49 mile
road race at Hedgeley. In
appalling conditions
however, both riders were
forced to retire early.
CHRISTIAN UNION
In On The
Action
As Christians we believe
that God has told us to get
involved in what's going on
around us. So, this term
we've spending our Friday
evening meetings looking
at 'mission'—what
Christians can and should
do in a practical way. We
began by considering the
general call God has made
that we should be working
for him. Then we had a
speaker from TEAR
fund—an international
agency for relief and
development. Then
someone spoke on the
problems of inner cities in
Britain and what can be
done. Last week our
speaker was from an
organisation who work in
evangelization behind the
iron curtain.
WINE TASTING
Plonk!
Although the Society has
finished this season of
tastings, I am hoping to run
a few more tastings this
term and through summer
on a smaller, more
informal basis. Numbers
will be strictly limited to 20
as there is invariably only
one bottle of each wine
available. These tastings
will not be subsidised and
because the wines on show
will be in the £5-£120 range
the cost will be around £4
unless otherwise stated.
Tickets will be sold in
advance as there is a limit
on numbers and they will
be available from me in
Biochem rm 103. They can
be reserved for 24 hours, in
advance, by phoning ext
4114.
If this ticket system
doesn't work an alternative
approach will be adopted,
but it is necessary to have
exact numbers.
The Programme is as
follows;
June 3rd Fine Italain Wines
(guaranteed no methanol)
Including 2 x '71 Barolo '58
Barolo etc.
June 10th St Emilion and
Pomerol range of vintages -
from 2 chateaux incl 1985
cask samples.
June 17th Chateau Chasse
Spleen Vintages 1976-1983
plus 1970 do not miss.
