Jobs
Former sabbaticals never
die they just keep proping
up the Union Bar...Union
President Carl Burgess
suddenly realised this last
week and decided to start
applying for jobs. Carl's
application to a well known
accountancy firm looked
impressive until one read
his leisure interests. In four
words Carl manages to
honestly sum up his
lifestyle, Carl described his
leisure interests as
drinking, womanising,
curries and cinema.
Pissed
Failed R C S U presidential
candidate Guy Perry spent
rather more time at Silwood
Ball than he had planned.
When the ball ended on the
Saturday morning Mr Perry
was 'crashed out'. Rather
than wake him his friends
decided to leave him there.
A tiredand emotional Mr
Perry spent most of
Saturday afternoon ringing
round College in an
attempt to get someone to
pick him up. Having finally
been assured that someone
was on their way to pick
him up, Mr Perry decided
to dilute his blood with a
little alcohol. Unfortunately
a double catastrophy
struck. Back in College his
friends had taken a vote
and decided to 'tell him his
not worth the petrol it'd
cost'. Back at Silwood Mr
Perry's attempts to get
pissed were failing because
he'd drunk most of a bottle
of Grenadine before
realising that it is non-
alcoholic syrup. Eventually
Mr Perry had to go begging
the money to enable him to
catch the last train back to
College.
Prince Charles IDave Jones
Diisseldorf
Hugh Southey and Dave
Jones' trip to Diisseldorf
appears to hae been quite a
freebie. The more
observant Union hacks will
have noticed that the cards
sent to places like the
Union Office had pictures
of Mochengladbach rather
than Diisseldorf
(Monchengladbach is half
an hour form Dusseldorf by
train), they also returned
with tales of a massive piss
up in Dusseldorf on
Saturday night when Dave
Jones was propositioned
by an eighteen year old but
couldn't work out what was
going on as he didn't speak
German (weak excuse) and
Dave was accused of
looking like Prince Charles
by some German students.

A Transport
Officer Writes...
' Dear Hugh,
At the Recreational Clubs
Committee (RCC) meeting
on Thursday 15th May,
plans were revealed for
Union Finance Committee
(UFC) to suspend grants to
several high spending clubs
next year. Clubs named
were Balloon, Canoe,
Caving, Gliding and
Mountaineering. This
action is designed to save
the Union £12,000;
however, the removal of
finance from these clubs is
synonymous with killing
them off, since it becomes
impossible to operate and
to attract and train new
members without adequate
finance.
This action will, in
addition to leading to the
rapid demise of some of
the most active, successful
and prestigious clubs, and
have other undesireable
results.
1 Four of the five R C C
clubs named
(Mountaineerng, Caving,
Canoe and Balloon) are the
major users of the transport
system. The removal of
funds to these clubs would
lead to the loss of over fifty
termtime weekends of use;
about two months of Easter
and Christmas vacation
usage and up to four
months of summer vacation
hirings . This would
represent a loss of revenue
to the union of the order of
£7000 to £8000. The Union
can only offer it cheap hire
rates on the basis of heavy
usage of vehicles, and not
allowing them to spend
most of their time in the
parking lot. Such a
reduction in revenue and
demand for vehicles would
lead to a sharp reduction in
the fleet size to one or
perhaps and the most two
vehicles.
This would result in a
large reduction in vehicle
availability to both weekend
and mideweek users and
would inevitably lead to
much more expensive
charges to other users (£40
for a single day plus
15p/mile for outside hire
compared with £18/day
plus 5p/km for ICU vans).
This would inevitably lead to
much greater costs ot
many other Union clubs
and is undesirable. Further,
the opportunities for tours
to the continent would be
reduced as outside hire
firms rarely allow their
vehicles to travel abroad.
Many users would find
themselves unable to
obtain transport at short
notice. The implicit
usefulness of a Union
transport fleet in uncharged
services such as
transporting goods,
members of the executive
and council to Silwood etc
would be greatly reduced.
If this abhorrent policy of
saving money by axing
clubs is adopted, budget
short falls, on the same
basis, would kill off othe
large transport users in
later years and quickly lead
to the Union being unable
to run any vehicle. Thus
this short-sighted policy
would lead to a massive
loss of utility to the whole
Union.
Further, R C C have
traditionally provided
people to help maintain the
transport system, since for
historical reasons vehicles
originally belonged to R C C
and not to ICU. This
proposed U F C policy could
easily lead to no people
being prepared to run the
transport system in a
reduced form.
2 It would lead to a lower
number of applicants to IC
because of the resultant
poorer club structure. Many
people in the past have
been swung in their
decision to come to IC by
its superb club structure.
3 It would change the ethic
of a student Union away
from its acknowledged role
of providing students with
the opportunity of
acquiring useful skills in
new sports, reacreations
and pastimes. All of the
clubs threatened make an
excellent contribution to.
training people in new
sports that they would
otherwise have been unable
to try. This range of
opportunity must be
preserved and not killed off
because certain Union
officials decide to take
action against societies
who are not well
represented in the
bureaucratic circles of the
Union. It would be a much
more honourable and
responsible choice to
distribute the expenditure
reductions across the
board and allow all
activities to continue.
Don't let the U F C destroy
your Union — oppose the
move to take away finance
from any club.
Yours faithfully
