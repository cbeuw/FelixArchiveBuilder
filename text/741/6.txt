Limited
List
Undesirable
Pharmacists at ICI, writing
in the Lancet, suggest that
j the government's 'limited
: list' may be causing
unexpected—and
undesirable—effects. Under
I the limited list, or generic
i prescribing, general
ipracticioners may only
prescribe drugs by a
general name, rather than
by trade name, and then
\ only from an approved list
| of drugs.
The studies were
1 performed using the ICI
I drug Inderal, and its
J generic equivalent
I propranolol (used to
I forestall attacks of angina
I pectoris, a severe pain due
[ to shortage of oxygen in
|| the heart).
The ICI study shows the
1 incidence of side-effects
among patients using the
generic drug is much
I higher than with Inderal.
1 Two possible reasons for
1 this difference are
I suggested:
1 «that the way the generic
drug is formulated is more
1 likely to cause side efects;
I or
| «that the problem is not
i associated with any
II specific formulation but
1 with a consequence of
I generic prescribing,
II namely, that patients may
I receive a variety of different
I products depending on
1 what the chemist has in
I stock. It may be, they
suggest, that repeated
I changes in the drug
II formula cause increased
I; side effects.
Another report from
I doctors at Guy's hospital,
I published in the British
I Medical Journal, has shown
I that a breast cancer drug
1 j Tamoxifen may be less
I effective than the ICI
I version Nolvadex. Six
I patients on generic
l Tamoxifen suffered pain
which dissappeared when
Nolvadex was substituted.
Generic prescribing is
| | claimed to save the
II National Health Service
I about £25 million a year.
There have been a number
| j of additions to the limited
I list since it was introduced
in 1984: this new evidence
| . suggests that further
I alterations may be
I necessary.

The Week In Science
Time Out Meets Tomorrow's World
visiting fellow to St Clare's
Hall Cambridge, gave a
lecture on 'Seminal
Plasmin—A Potent
Antimicrobial And
Transcription Inhibitory
Protein Which May Be
Nature's Own Antifertility
Agent'.
Prof Bhargava is an
exceptional biologist
students scientists,
probably being the largest
research institute of its type
in India (see Nature March
1984).
Prof Bhargava has
published many articles in
Nature on the subject of
seminal plasmin.
His lecture dealt with the
various properties of
seminalplasmin and their
applications this being
presented as a chronology
of his research on the
subject. The 2 key areas
are
11ts antimicrobial properties
although this does not
appear to be its major role.
2 It is a natural
contraceptive There are 2
forms of seminal plasma
and the relative
concentration of the two
seems to determines
whether fertilization will
occur or not. In humans
and many domestic animals
the fertilization rate is
about 30%. The possibility
of this research is that this
fertilization rate could be
increased and this would
have major effects on
artifical insemination of
farm animals and for in
vitro fertilization in humans
(test tube babys).
This lecture showed the
importance and need for
pure research and that a lot
of important research
occurs outside the bastions
of western universities.
Pill For Jet Lag
Recent research in the US
suggests that
benzodiazepine sleeping
tablets may be of use in
coping with jet lag.
Many of the functions of
the human body are
periodic: the body has a
clock, called the circadian
clock, which has a period
of around 24 hours. It is
synchronised using the 24
hour alternation of light
and dark, day and night.
When humans travel to
different time zones, the
clock gets out of phase—it
is still ticking away, but it
isn't quite sure what time it
is. The human biological
clock needs resetting.
This is usually achieved
by repeated exposure to
the local cycle of day and
night—after a few cycles
the brain accepts the shift
in phase, and jet lag has
passed.
The benzodiazepine drug
may allow people to reset
their biological clocks just
as easily as they reset their
watches.
Scientists in the US took
a hamster, and recorded its
activity rhythm for two
weeks. They then injected
the animal with a neutral
substance at any one of
eight equally spaced times
in its circadian clock cycle.
The activity rhythm
continued as usual. But if
2.5mg of the
benzodiazaepoine drug
triazolam was added, the
clock was changed by
about an hour. The
hamsters bedtime—and all
its other regular functions
such as wheel-running
activity—were immediately
put back one hour, or
advanced one hour. (The
direction of the effect
depended on the time of
day when the drug was
administered.) What is
more, the size of the phase
shift could be easily
controlled, the scientists
dicovered, by altering the
dose of Triazolam.
The implications for jet
travellers are obvious.
The drug is thought to
work by potentiating the
action of the
neurotransmitters gamma-
aminobutyric acid, a widely
distributed transmitter in
the central nervous system
