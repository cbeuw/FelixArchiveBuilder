Even dumber
There was a mistake in last
week's puzzle;as set, it was
impossible - sorry! The
problem was to get three
students, Dumb, Dumber.and
Dumbest,down from the
Queen's tower using a rope
and pulley with a 30Kg
rock as a counterweight.
The weights of the students
are 84Kg,72Kg,and 36Kg
respectively ( not as stated
last week ).No climbing or
pulling of ropes is allowed;
the weight difference
between the ends of the
rope is all that can cause
movement, and it mustn't
be more than 6Kg or the
students will come down to
fast. The only other
restriction is that no more
than two people, or one
person and the rock, can
hold onto one end of the
rope at a time. Answers,
as usual, to the FELIX
office by 1.00pm
Wednesday.
Dodgey Dice-solution
This is one of those
problems where
mathematics defies
intuition. Surely if on
average dice A beats dice
B, and on average dice B
beats diace C, then Dice A
must beat dice C . Wrong.
Consider the following:
5 3
1 5 1 3 3 3
A;
T B
3
3
2
2 2 2
C

6
mEGflBRfllfl
Dice A beats B with odds
2:1, B beats C 2: 1, but C
beats A 5:4.
In the problem I asked
you to invent four dice with
this property. The only
solution was entered by J
Smith and D C h u , both
Computer PG's.
A beats B 2:1
B beats C 5:4
C beats D 2:1^
C beats A 2;V
Well done. If you include
the value zero then it is
possible to have all the
odds at 2:1
