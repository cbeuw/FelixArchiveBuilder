South Africa
Attacked
Dear Hugh,
I would like to comment on
several remarks made in
FELIX since my letter on
South Africa in no. 737.
Firstly, the comment that
apartheid is not an extreme
right-wing philosophy does
not really stand up to any
serious investigation. Take
for example President
Botha's two immediate
predecessors, Henrick
Verwoerd and John
Vorster. During the last
war, Verwoerd and his
newspaper openly
supported Hitler, and
campaigned for South
Africa to change sides
during the war, and had
links with the pro-Nazi
'Under the Swastika' group.
Vorster, Prime Minister
until the late seventies, was
a General in another pro-
Hitler group, the
'Ossewabrandwag'. These
two men were two of the
chief architects of the post-
war apartheid. Perhaps
Hitler was also an 'ethnic
socialist'.
I was, within these
hallowed pages, labelled an
'extremist' for my criticism
of apartheid's 'reforms',
especially of the abolition
of the Pass laws. My belief
that the 'orderly
urbansations' programmes
replacing them was nothing
more than a political sleight
of hand was not actually an
idea of may own invention,
but was an opinion
expressed in a Leader
column of that well known
'Marxist' newspaper—the
'Jonannesburg Star' (8th
April 1986).
Several reasons for
opposition to sanctions
have been expressed in
recent weeks. One of these
was a fear that sanctions
would have a serious effect
on other countries in
Southern Africa. This is
not, apparently , a fear
shared by these countries
themselves. At a meeting of
the 'frontline states' of
Angola, Botswana,
Tanzania, Mozambique,
Zambia and Zimbabwe in
Luanda in April, they all
called for the Western
governments to impose
comprehensive sanctions
on South Africa.
I also think that the view
that black South Africans
have the highest living
standard of black Africans
is false. The infant mortality
rate, for instance, which
gives some indication of
the conditions in which
black families live, is
aorund 14%, and in some
rural communities figures
as high as 50% have been
recorded recently, the
majority of which are from
things such as malnutrion,
gastro-entiritis and
tuberculosis—virtually
unheard of in those parts of
Africa not presently
suffering from drought, yet
South Africa is a rich
agricultural country, able to
export a wide variety of
foodstuff.
However, whether or not
they have the highest black
living standard in Africa is
not the point. The real
injustice is the
astronomical difference in
that between black and
white South Africans. That
should certainly not be
preserved.

I am chairman of Canoe
Club. Last week at the
A G M of the R C C it was
announced by Dave
Kingston that certain of the
most experienced (high
spending) clubs are to be
removed from any form of
finance next year,
effectively destroying them.
We were given only 8 days
notice to come up with
justification for their '
existence (timely for the
start of exams). Five
outdoor clubs are on the
hit list and their effective
removal will further harm
the image and strength of
IC as a college with
interesting and wide-
ranging activities to offer.
This sort of approach, if
encouraged, is likely to
continue.
We feel that this is not
the way to produce savings
if this is what the U F C
(Union Finance Comm)
requires. There was no
consultation with clubs
before hand to try and find
other areas of saving,
across the board. There is
spending amongst clubs
that can be eliminated
without ruining the clubs.
Higher annual club
subscriptions would help
too-this is not an
unjustified request as price
rises in subscriptions have
not in general reflected the
increased financial
'hardships' external to the
clubs themselves.
Finally we would like to
point out that Canoe Club
and the other clubs
affected provide recreation
that helps people to
appreciate the outdoors
which is valuable for such a
place as London.

Dear Hugh,
Now is the time of year that
ICU and its officers (myself
included) goes gently mad.
For it is during this term,
that we have to find our
way out of the financial
mess that next year's
budget is in. The 'mess' this
year is a budget deficit of
about £12,000 for next year.
The major act of
madness that Union
Finance Committee (UFC)
has nearly committed is an
act of wanton vandalism of
ICU's superb club
structure. It has been
proposed that the deficit
should be made up by
withdrawing finance from
several high spending
clubs. Within my
committee, the clubs which
have been named as
possible targets for this
destruction are Balloon,
Canoe, Caving, Gliding and
Mountaineering clubs.
These clubs, which include
two of the oldest university
clubs in their sports in
Britain, are highly active
with very committed and
compotent members. The
expertise within these clubs
has led to a number of first
ascents of mountains by
Mountaineering Club, the
discovery and exploration
of South America's deepest
cave by Caving Club. The
commitment of the club
members is immense with
individuals spending up to
30-40 weekends and £1000
a year out of their own
pockets participating
The alternative to this
terrible destruction of clubs
is an 'across the board' cut.
This would spread the
suffering, so tht no one
would suffer majority and
lose their sport totally. The
cut would have very little
effect in real terms as it
would be done on next
year's estimates.
I hope for the support of
members of Imperial
College Union to fight this
dreadful proposal.
Remember it could be your
club next time.
Yours sincerely
Tim Palmer
