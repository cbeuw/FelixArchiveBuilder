New Standard
For TV
A Japaneses suggestion to
adopt a 1125-line standard
television picture was put
to the International Radio
Conultative Committee this
month. This would be a
significant improvement on
the 625-line system we use
in the UK. The Committee
has decided that the high
definition system should
not be adopted as standard
there is no way of
transmitting the signals;
and no TV sets to receive
them?
The proposed new
standard works on 60
Hertz, or cycles a second.
Unfortunately the electricity
supply in Europe—and
three-quarters of the
world—works on 50 Hz.
Secondly, existing
terrestrial transmitters
could not cope with the
high bandwidth required
for the high-definition
signal. A fundamental law
of communication is
Hartley's law, which states
that the more information
you want to send in a given
time, the higher your
bandwidth has got to be.
Existing TV bands are
already crammed with
visions, sound, colour and
teletext information, and
the new system would
necessitate the use pf
direct broadcasting
satellites.
But the main worry about
adoption of the standard is
economic rather than
technical—the European
TV industry does not want
to accept a standard that
will guarantee the Japanese
a monopoly in the market.
The Europeans are also
working on new systems of
their own. Adopting the
Japanese standard would
render all current TV sets
and recording apparatus
obsolete.
results in a dramatically
improved picture quality.
The system permits ten
times more colour
information to be
transmitted for each of the
primary colours, giving
much better colour hues
and saturation on the
screen. The new system
would also have a
'Cinemascope' type screen
with a width to height ratio
of 5:3, compared with the
present 4:3. The system
would also allow stereo
sound.
Like many technological
advances, high-definition
TV comes partly from spin-
offs from the computer
industry: very fast
microprocessor chips allow
much easier manipuation of
the video signal. There
have also been advances in
TV camera technology.
High-definition TV is
already being used to make
programmes and record
them. After editing, the
images are transferred to 1-
inch video tape for ordinary
broadcasting on 625 lines.
The transmission of
1125-line signals to viewer's
homes is still some way off,
though research is under
way in Japan to produce
sets to receive the pictures.
Despite the problems, the
high-definition system does
have a lot going for it. It
allows twice as many
scanning lines, and more
than four times as many
pictures elements, as
standard systems. This
How TV Works
TV cameras scan much in the same way as your eye is
reading these lines: they scan from left to right, with
rapid flyback between lines, combined with a slower
vertical movement down the page. This is achieved in a
cathode ray tube by applying a high-frequency time
base horizontally, and a lower-frequency time base
vertically. A spot traces out lines on the screen, and the
intensity of the spot varies from point to point to make
up a picture.
To cover all the picture elements, several hundred
lines must be produced on the screen. In Britain the
standard is 625 lines, and the complete picture is
scanned 25 times a second. Now 25 pictures a second
is a low enough frequency to cause visible flicker. To
avoid this, the scene is actually scanned 50 times a
second, first the odd lines only, and then the even
lines. Athough the picture frequency is really only 25
Hz, the time base applied vertically is 50 Hz—the
frequency of the domestic electricity supply in most of
the world except the US and Japan.
This division of the picture into odd and even lines is
called interlacing, and each scan, of half the complete
picture, is called a field.
