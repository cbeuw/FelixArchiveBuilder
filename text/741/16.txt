2% Cut
For IC
continued from front page
pressure will be taken off
the Universities in future,
however they would have
to suffer this year.
Maurice Shock,
Chairman of the Committee
of Vice-Chancellors and
Principals, in reply to the
U G C letter, expressed his
concern about the latest
round of cuts. University
grants have, he said,
declined by 20% in real
terms since 1980 and cuts
could reach a total of 30%
by the end of the decade.
This roughly concurs with
the prediction of the
Rector, Professor Eric Ash,
of a 10% cut for IC over the
next five years, as there is
now no reason to expect
that IC will get any special
treatment from the G U C .
Mr Shock also felt that a
more longterm approach to
Higher Education should
be taken by the
Government. For the
present, however, he
summed up the situation by
saying, 'no university is
going to be better off next
year'.
Hammers
Slammed
Workmen in Falmouth
Keogh Hall have been
banned from hammering
and structural drilling until
the end of the exams. The
ban follows a sit in by
residents of the hall in the
office of Peter Hallworth.
Residents of the hall have
been complaining about
noise disrupting their
revision for several weeks.
They decided to sit in when
they believed their
complaints were being
ignored. Mr Hallworth told
FELIX though that he had
not realised that students
were being disrupted. He
said he had written at
Easter to the hall wardens
and housekeepers telling
them that he would stop
any work that was
disturbing work. He
regretted that a breakdown
in communications had
meant that students had
failed to contact him
directly. Any students who
are disturbed should
contact Mr Hallworth on
3605.
Members of next year's Guilds Exec show what they're
made of during last weeks trouserless boatrace.
Racist Ban 'Misguided'
Sir Keith Joseph has
attacked the 'no-platform
for racists' policy adopted
by many student unions. In
a letter to NUS President
Phil Woolas, Sir Keith
condemns racism and
facism. He argues, though,
that the policy of some
student unions to deny
speaking rights to invited
speakers who have been
branded as racist is 'wrong,
misguided and harmful'. He
appealed to students to
protect freedom of speech
before lasting damage was
done to their institutions
and to the country's
political life. A motion that
would have resulted in ULU
adopting such a policy was
defeated at a recent
meeting of the General
Union Council.

Sir Keith
Goes

replaced as Education
Secretary by Mr Kenneth
Baker, the former
Environment Minister. Mr
Baker is a noted wet in the
cabinet who has a
reputation as a skillful
communicator. It's
understood thai he has
been given the post of
Education Secretary in an
attempt to improve the
public's view of the
government's education
policy.
Star Wars
Petition
The International Peace
Communication and
Coordination Centre has
launched an international
petition against Star Wars.
The IPCC, which
represents peace groups
throughout the world will
present the petition to
N A T O at the end of May.
The group feels that the
testing of misile defences
will violate the Anti-Bolistic
Misile and Partial Test Ban
Treaties, leading to a
breakdown in arms control.
Hey Big
Spender
High spending Union clubs
have been asked to justify
their spending at an
emergency meeting of the
Union Finance Committee

Union needs to cut £14000

next year and it has been
suggested that certain high
spending clubs should be
completely cut. The clubs
under threat are Balloon,
Canoe, Caving,
Mountaineering, Gliding,
Boat, Yacht and STOIC.
