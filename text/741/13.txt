BOAT CLUB
Ghent Tour Successes
Crews from Imperial beat
international standard
opposition form France,
Germany, Belgium and
Britain, to bring back a
gold, silver and two bronze
medals. This is a
remarkable result and is
unprecedented in the club's
history
The whole tour started
out more disasterously. To
make the ferry to Dunkirk
we needed to be at the
boat club by six thirty in
the morning. When the
coach arrived we were
surprised to find that it had
metamorphosed from the
luxury coach with video,
toilet and reclining seats
that was promised to a
scrawny 'Fortune Travel'
coach, with no amenities
and quarter sized seats.
Naturally we totally believe
the drivers story that the
promised coach had been
'vandalised'.
It was raining in Belgium
when we arrived and the
radioactive drizzle hardly
stopped—but that didn't
stop us all from being
suntanned—thanks Uncle
Gorbachev.
Lightweight Coxless four
The members of the
lightweight coxless four
had considerable difficult
making the weight. Their
first weigh in revealed that
they needed to loose three
kilograms, before averaging
under 70kg. After a run in
extra kit they managed to
sweat off the surplus, but
were by this time looking
horrifyngly emaciated. After
such trauma the crew were
delighted to pick up the
gold medal on Saturday-
beating crews from
Germany and Holland. The
second day's racing
brought them a further
bronze medal.
Coxed Four
By contrast to the
lightweights, the
heavyweight coxed four
believed that their
performance was marred
by their requirement to
race early heats before
breakfast. I don't think its
quite so simple: the
continental breakfasts with
which we were provided
were so unappetising that
only Vince 'Dustybin' Roper
was able to manage two,
and even he is suspected of
ulterior motives. As is often
the case with Vince there
may have been a woman
involved. Despite their
severe breakfast defficiency
the coxed four still
managed convincingly to
win their heat and gained a
silver medal losing only to
a crew from the German
national squad. As with the
lightweights they also won
a bronze on the second
day.
Heavyweight Coxless Four
The problem with the
coxless boats is their
erratic steering and it was a
tragic case of bad steering
that spoiled the medal
hopes of the heavyweight
coxless four, and that
found them attempting to
row on dry land.
Eight
The second eight, if
nothing else, made a
positive contribution to
international detente. They
suffered a series of
disasters leaving them two
men short at Ghent and so
were forced to recruit from
the pool of international
oarsmen, who had finished
compating for th day. They
were very lucky to find a
Dutchman, who being
unable to speak English,
was unaware quite what
was required of him and
after the race was unable to
voice his opinions of their
rowing. This as it turns out
was a good thing, because
the eight didn't exactly win.
The tour was enjoyable and
worthwhile. It was pleasing
to see none of the
drunkeness associated with
British sports fans abroad.

ATHLETICS
London
Colleges
Championship
Victory
No mistakes on selection
were made this year by the
Athletics Secretary in
sending a virtually full
Imperial squad to London
Colleges Athletics champs
at Motspur Park on
Tuesday and Wednesday
the 29th and 30th April.
The overall performance
was exceptional and
everyone in the squad
pulled their weight.
For the ladies, Imoni
Akpofure came third in
100/200m finals (13.6/28.8)
finished 6th in the 100m
hurdles final and jumped
1.40m in the high jump for
5th and good points-the
first six in each event
scoring. Louise McKeown
came 6th in the ladies
800m and Jane Murphy
threw the discus nearly
18m for 5th. In the ladies
300m Kate Spence ran
particularly well in rapidly
diminishing light for
second place. Jo Savage
yet again proved invaluable
for the ladies with a 1.50m
second place in the high
jump, 4th in the 100
hurdles final and 6th in the
shot.
The mens' team was by
far the strongest for years.
Although a couple of
people were injured. In the
sprints we again had a
display of the Nehinda law
of motion and training,
namely the less training
you appear to do the faster
you go with a valiant
attempt at the 'sprint
double'-1st in 100m (11.2s),
2nd in 200m(22.8s). Bryan
Gamblin was deprived of
medals in the 800m
(1:57.9), 1500m (4.13.8) and
2000m steeplechase
(6:29.8) coming second
each time to UK 5000m
man Mark Scrutton as was
Gavin Waterson in 3000m
(2nd: 9:07). Doing a good
supporting role to these
men were Mike Jones (6th,
400m), Trevor Shaw (4th,
1500m) and captain Jon
Lea (3rd in both 2000 s/c
and 3000m). Pete Sedders
carved a new niche for
himself in the 110m hurdles
which he won whilst doing
his usual sterling work in
the field with a 2nd in both
Discus (31.28m) and
Hammer, 4th in the Javelin
injuring himself in the
process, and a win of
10,66m in the shot. Chris
Owen supported well in the
Hammer wiih a third. In the
2000m Walk Chris
Wheedon walked away with
it (sorry Ed) and John Pope
did the secretaries job
getting good points for
third place. The triple jump
proved quite strong this
year with R Johnson
gaining only 4th for a jump
of 12.56m which has been
known to win the
championship before. UK
Ranked Long Jumper
Denzil Nicholson showed
his class leaping over a
metre further than his
nearest rival with a jump of
7.13 metres.
Finally, the team was
complete with a guy who is
probably closer than
anyone else will be to
human powered flight in
this country for a long time.
Geoff Parsons, UK indoor
and outdoor record holder
who only recently improved
his outdoor best by 1cm to
2.27m at Crystal Palace
scissored over 2.00m,
casually leapt 2.20m to set
a Motspur Park ground
record and made a good
attempt at 2.27m on a
relatively poor run up
surface. To add to this, he
jumped 13.76m in the triple
jump for a clear second
and finished 4th in the
100m.
Many thanks are due to
everyone who took
part—every single person
was invaluable. Good luck
for the you-know-whats
and see you next year!
