Sabbatical Reports E 7 |
Thrown Out At AGM m
~ u
The Annual Reports of the
President and Deputy President
were rejected by the IC Union
Annual General Meeting
yesterday. Objections were
made to sections of both
reports, which appeared in
FELIX last week, and on the
vote both were defeated.
Annual Reports are presented
to the A G M each year by the
sabbaticals and other Union
officers. The sabbaticals'
reports in particular normally
form a permanent record of the
year. The rejection of the two
main reports is unprecendented
and leave's much of the Union's
work this year unrecorded
except in the much shorter non-
sabbatical officers' reports.
President Carl Burgess
announced his intention of not
producing another Annual
Report to replace the rejected
one.
The major objections to the
reports centred on personal
comments about other Union
officers by the President and
DP. In the case of the
President's report, criticism
was made of his comments on
FELIX and the Publications
Board. Mr Burgess added a new
section to the report toning
down some of his comments,
but Sarah Greaves still objected
to its adoption. On the vote the
report was defeated.
DP Dave Kingston withdrew
sections of his report which
criticized External Affairs
Officer Grenville Manuel and
Welfare Officer Pete Wilson. Its
acceptance was nevertheless
opposed by Mark Cottle and it
was heavily defeated.
The report of Hon Sec
Quentin Fontana was accepted
without a vote after a few
questions from the floor. Then
the report of Academic Affairs
Officer J Martin Taylor was
considered. Carl Burgess
objected to his comment that
this had been the worst year for
the Union in his seven years as
a student here, and his
description of the sabbaticals as
'the most incompetant, lazy and
inexperienced leadership that I
have ever seen'. However, the
report was passed unamended
by a comfortable majority.
The reports of the Internal
Services Chairman the PG
Officer, the Publications Board
Chairman, the Rag Chairman,
the R C C Chairman and the
S C A B Chairman were all
quickly passed. Objections were
made to Welfare officer Pete
Wilson's report, on the grounds
that it was a bad as Dave
Kingston's, and it was defeated
on the vote.
Earlier in the meeting the
Presidient presented Union
General Awards to Sean Davies,
Chris Hendy, Nick Shackley and
Hugh Southey. This is the
Presidents personal award for
outstanding services to the
Union. He also presented Social
Colours to several members of
College staff who have helped
the Union during the year.
Elections were held at the
meeting for Ordinary Members
of Council, with Symon Corns
and Jerry Hasnip being elected,
and for a member of House
Committee, with Alan Rose
being elected. The meeting also
passed unanimously a motion
on Human Rights proposed by
Christine Taig. Finally, Shaun
Dunlop proposed a motion
banning Barclays Bank
advertising in Union
publications, but as soon as he
had finished the quorum was
challenged. Since less then 300
people were present the
meeting closed due to
inquoracy.
Mr Burgess and Mr Kingston
both stood by the comments in
their reports when interviewed
after the meeting. Mr Burgess
pointed out that only the Pub
Board section of his report was
questioned, and that the rest
was rejected along with this.
He thought there had been a
great deal of personal animosity
in the Union this year, which he
regretted. Despite the rejections
of his report, he felt that he had
done his job well, better than
most people realised.
Mr Kingston said he had
changed some sections of his
report after discussing it with
the people he had criticized. He
found he had got some facts
wrong and could not justify
some of his statements, so he
amended his report. He still
stood by his report as amended.
He too mentioned the high level
of personal animosity this year,
and felt that the sabbaticals
were not respected by other
Union officers.
2% Cut For IC
Imperial College will receive a
1.2% increase in its recurrent
grant next year, says the latest
U G C circular to Vice-
Chancellors and Principals. This
'increase' is above average for
the University system as a
whole but represents a 2% cut
in the purchasing power of the
IC grant. The U G C were given a
3% increase overall for next
year, but due to the rise in local
authority rates which
constitutes an inordinately large
part of the U G C budget, and
due to other U G C obligations,
they were unable to add more
than 1% to the block grant
which is distributed to the
Universities. Sir Keith Joseph,
former Minister for Education
and Science, has said that
