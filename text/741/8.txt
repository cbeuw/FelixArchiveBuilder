eviews Beautiful
Baby.
This week's theme is
women. Because films are
largely written and made by
men they often portray
women, rarely the key
characters in films anyway,
in terms of stereotypes and
all too frequently a
misguided, misogynistic
view this is. Two films
released this week neatly
illustrate common
perceptions of women in
film. The first, 9|/2 weeks,
shows a wholly subservient
character performing her
lover's every whim, though
not always entirely willing,
and to be fair she does
exhibit some independence
finally. The second
concerns a femme fatale,
suitably enough for a
French film He Died With
His Eyes Open.
9V2 weeks is the duration
of the relationship between
Elizabeth, (Kim Basinger),
and John, (Mickey Rourke).
John is a money lender and
his whole attitude is that of
a calm, controlled man
used to being very much
in command, so much so
that his relationships with
women are sadistic, not
that he subjects them to
physical pain particularly,
but that he humiliates
them. His first sentences to
Elizabeth are an ominous
portent, whilst in an Italian
restaurant he tells her of
some of the Mafia killings
that happened in the seat
she is sitting. He enjoys
provoking fear in his lovers
and evidently confuses fear
and sexual excitement
(although they both have
similar physical
manifestation).
Because there is
something in the
relationship that Elizabeth
wants she has to accept
everything else that goes
with it. Although she is a
smart businesswoman who
is too cultivated and too
busy for most men, she
finds herself intrigued by
John. Slowly she lets him
take more and more control
over her, even in public,
until the point where she
has to decide between her
self-destructive fantasies
and maintaining her grip on
reality.
The film is very good at
showing the desires of the
characters, showing both
John's ability to control,
and why he chose
Elizabeth; how he knew
she'd respond to him, "I
saw myself in you" and
Elizabeth's interest in
power and it's symbols, for
example using the
work, friends, previous
relationships and by only
learning about John
through what he tells her
the film itself tends to
linger on the body of Ms
Basinger and is very much
from a male point of view,
and this dichotomy
prevents the film from
becoming fully involving.
Take off your dress.
May I blindfold you?'
'What if I don't want you to?'
'You can ask me to leave.'
'I don't want you to leave.'
telephone as a device to
emphasise the distance and
solution of these two
characters and also as a
symbol of power and
control. When Elizabeth is
left alone in John's
apartment, she looks
around. Not unreasonable,
but he then phones to find
out if she's been a 'nosey
parker' and reprimands her
for so doing.
Whilst the story is told
from Elizabeth's point of
view, by revealing
something about her life,
Although it has moments of
great sexuality, passion and
humour as well as
unpleasantness, there is a
certain detachment that
prevents the audience from
experiencing all the
emotions that it should
from this. Further, their
attitude to Johns sexual
deviance is a little
ambivalent, not to say
ambiguous.
The ending however is
very poignant, when he
realises that Elizabeth is
leaving him John begins to
tellher about himself and
his childhood and tearfully
confesses, 'I never counted
on loving you so much', to
which she replies, almost
as hurt, 'It wouldn't be over
until one of us said stop.
You wouldn't say it'.
Both Mick Rarke and Kim
Basinger have infectious
smiles but, all credit to
both the acting and the
casting, Mickey Rarke's is
that of a naughty little boy
lost with a certain
impending evil danger
about it, where as Kim
Basinger's smile is
submissive and kissable,
the sort that male fantasies
are made of.
The director Adrian Lyne
has a evident passion for
films, 'I want to make films
that linger, that audiences
care about', and as wih his
previous film, Flashdance
he shows an a liking for
music which in this film is
omnipresent, but not
obtrusive. He also, along
with cinematographer Peter
Biziou has produced a film
that looks wonderful, but I
can't help feeling that
there's something vaguely
obscene about unpleasant
activities beautifully
portrayed. Jim Clayden.
