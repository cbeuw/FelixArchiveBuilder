Caving
Defended
Dear Hugh,
We were greatly concerned
to hear of a proposal by
Dave Kingston to withdraw
all funding from certain
prestige Union clubs. The
clubs threatened are
rumoured to include
Balloon, Boat, Canoe,
Caving, Gliding,
Mountaineering, S T O I C
and Yacht, eight of the
most distinguished clubs at
college. All of these clubs
are well known outside
College and bring good
publicity for Imperial
College.
These proposed cuts are
due to the fact that next
year's planned expenditure
exceeds available funding
! by approximately £12,000
| and rather than taking a
fair cut across the board it
seemed easier to close
down certain selcted clubs.
These threatened clubs
| have been given barely a
week to prepare their case
justifying their continued
existance. Not only is this
appallingly short notice but
I the timing of the
announcement comes in
the middle of many
students' exams.
This planned drastic
move would literally
destroy the threatened
clubs whose expertise and
reputation has been built
up over long years of
dedicated commitment to
!
their club and their sport
by the many students who
have been members of
these prestigious clubs.
These clubs are as
willing as any other take
their fair share of the
necessary cuts in proposed
spending, but removing
funding and hence closing
these clubs would leave
substantial gaps in the
activities available to
students, making IC an
even less attractive
university for potential
students.
An active member of the
I caving club would expect
to spend in the region of
.I £700 per annum on
| maintainance and purchase
of necessary equipment,
and term-time and vacation
activities. Eight members of
the caving club will be
spending at least £700 this
summer on an expedition
to Canadian Rockies.To us
t this represents a serious
financial commitment to
our sport and withdrawal of
Union funds would
increase this burden out of
all proportion and would
I undoubtedly put the sport
of caving beyond the reach
of new College members.
This would mark the end of
a quarter of a century of
caving at Imperial College.
For these reasons we feel
these proposals are totally
unreasonable and
unacceptable, we hope
U F C will see sense on this
issue.
Yours Sincerely

Collcott, Dave Wilson
Balloon
Defended
Dear Ed,
Imperial is one of only
three colleges in Britain
with a hot air balloon club.
If Union Finance
Committee have their way
today there may only be
two university balloon
clubs next year.
At the R C C general
meeting last week we were
told of a crazy U F C policy
to cease funding 'two or
three' high spending clubs
next year. There is a
£15,000 shortfall in Union's
grant next year!! Five R C C
clubs (balloon one of them)
have been put on a 'hit list'
by U F C and we have had
the grand total of eight
days notice to justify our
existence and stop this
ridiculous U F C policy
being approved. Why
couldn't the clubs have
been told earlier of the
problems facing union
inorder to find a solution?
U F C have it in their
minds that by denying
activities such as
mountaineering, canoeing,
ballooning, caving etc, to
students this financial
problem will be solved.
Only in the short term will
it have any effect. By
cutting a grant to any club
the Union is stabbing itself
in the back. College will
see the Union's defeatist
attitude as an opportunity
to cut the Union grant in
following years.
The clubs singled out for
closure are amongst the
most prestigious in
College. Balloon club has
existed for ten years, a
relatively young club, and
in that time many members
have given valuable time to
build the club to its present
thriving state.
Balloon club is a
fantastic advertisement for
Union and for College. We
have been INVITED to four
balloon meets this summer,
one of which is the Bristol
Fiesta regularly attracting
more than 100,000 people
each year. We project a
fine image of College, all
over the country, unlike
other 'elements' in College.
Our prestigious R C C
clubs should not be forced
to close. This policy is yet
another sign of the decay
of IC Union.
Mike Carpenter
Chairman Balloon Club
Mountaineering
Defended
Sir,
At the recent Recreational
Clubs Committee meeting
(15th May) the five largest
spending clubs per head
(Balloon, Canoe, Caving,
Gliding and
Mountaineering) were
asked to provide written
justification for their
expenditure. It appears that
U F C is to consider axing
the grants given to these
clubs in order to rectify
next year's Union budget
deficit. This would be an
Mountaineering: under threat
effective kiss-of-death for
those societies involved.
Mountaineering has
provided such a list of
reasons for justifying our
existence. I am sure these
points are mirrored by the
other threatened clubs. To
prevent the disappearance
of these points in to a web
of Union intrigue and
mindless bureaucracy ,
they are outlined below
1 One of the Union's
primary aims is to give
college students the
opportunity of participating
in activities in which they
have not had, or will not
have a chance to partake.
The cessation of official
club activities would not
prevent previously active
mountaineers from
climbing but it would stunt
the ambitions of many
aspirant climbers, who had
been assured of the
presence of a
mountaineering club by
various union and college
publications.
2 The Mountaineering
Club is perhaps the oldest
university climbing club in
Britain with a 60 year
history. During the period
an excellent expedition
record has been
established. In the past two
years the club has added
major new routes in S
America and S Africa.
These achievements have
done much to project our
college's image abroad. To
stop such endeavour in an
act of Dickensian penny-
pinching would be tragic.
3 Our club is arguably the
most experienced and
active college
mountaineering
organisation in London. We
have 25 Union members
and about 15 non-union
members (generally former
student) who engage in
activities ranging from
Himalayan mountaineering
to boulderifig. Our
committment to the sport is
high, an average member
of the club probably
spends about £600 per year
of his own money on
climbing. To say that these
people could be
accommodated in other
college clubs is naive.
An all encompasing
outdoor club would be
unmanageable and
unsatisfying for a majority
of its members.
4 The forthcoming
installation of college's new
£8,000 climbing wall seems
an inappropriate time to
propose the disbanding of
one of the club's who are
pledged to help maintain
this facility.
5 As the outdoor clubs
provide the bulk of the
Union's transit van income
(and manpower for running
the RCC), I hope that U F C
has not overlooked the
possibility of stabbing itself
in the back.
Thus I feel that to totally
axe certain clubs is unfair,
the load should be shared,
we are more than willing to
help, but we will not sit
back as the death sentence
is passed (with only 8 days
between arrest and
execution). Are certain
Union notables to take on
the guise of trigger-happy
despots while the clubs and
societies peer down the
gun barrel? Whose turn
would it be next year when
another deficit appears?
How long before the Union
pushes it self over the
abyss and ceases to serve
any of its members other
than a drunken clique?
Yours
Mark Dixon (Chem 3)
(The last?) ICMC President

Friday 23 May FELIX
