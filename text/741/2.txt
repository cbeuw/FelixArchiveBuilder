The AGM's decision to
reject Carl's, Dave's and
Pete Wilson's reports was
essentially the right
decision. There is no policy
on what a report is meant
to include. Half the reports
this year were a list of
personal opinions and the
other half were factual. The
A G M had to decide
whether personal opinions
were acceptable. It decided
they weren't accounts of
the year. It was then
consistent in throwing out
reports that were largely
opinions. I'm not going to
attack Carl or the others for
voicing their opinions in
their reports. He made a
decision about what he felt
the report should include.
He was prepared to say
what had upset him. I hope
that he and everyone else
accepts the A G M s decision
as laying guidelines for
reports rather than being a
personal attack on him or
anyone else. Carl has done
some good things and a lot
of the bitching was unfair. I
hope that people start
analysing the successes
and failures of the year
rather than continue the
bitching that has gone on
for the last few weeks. I
also hope that no one
presents an opinionated
report at next year's A G M .

Disgusted
Dear Hugh,
I was disgusted by the
comments of Carl Burgess
in his annual report where
he said that FELIX this year
had not represented the
views of the majority of
students and that basically
you were wasting your time
and the Union's money
producing it. If this is the
case then why have so few
people written to FELIX
complaining about its
content.
The people who work on
FELIX are very dedicated
and hard working and it is
the first time in many years
that a FELIX editor has
managed to produce a 16 â€¢
page FELIX throughout the
year. If articles and letters
do not get in then it is due
to lack of space, and Hugh
does his best to be fair to
everybody.
Before Carl starts
slagging off other people
he should put his own
house in order as his main
achievement this year has
been to bring discredit to
the College to the Union
and to himself.
It seems that the reason
for Mr Burgess slamming
FELIX is because Hugh has
made a stand against the
Union's misconduct and Mr
Burgess, instead of facing
up to his mistakes, is
passing the buck and using
Hugh as a scapegoat.
Finally all I can say is:

South Africa
Again
Dear Hugh,
May I reply to Alastair J
Slimebag (FELIX 740). The
mass organisations of the
South Africa people (which,
in the absence of any
democratic mechanism
provide probably the best
measure of popular
opinion) are unequivocal in
their calls to us to boycott
SA goods. The working
people of South Africa do
not benefit from'SA
exports: in the short term,
they are paid just enough
to keep them in the squalor
of the Bantustans. In the
longer term, every time we
buy Cape or Outspan we
prolong their suffering by
strengthening those who
do benefit from that
oppression and
exploitation. The boycott is
the best way we have to
help South Africans toward
democracy.
Mr Seymour is
depressingly close to the
truth when he says that
students tend to buy what's
cheapest. Think about it-it's
hardly likely that such
'good value' comes to us
because some South
African fruit farmer decides
to cut his profits it's just
that labour comes cheaper
when you can beat
troublemakers to death.
If it weren't for my
amazing tolerance and
mild-manneredness (?) I'd
join the bouncers at
'Bananas' in spitting
voluminously and often on
this Seymour wally.
Yours,
Pete Hobbis
Colours
Dear Hugh,
With the publishing of this
year's Social Colour awards
in FELIX last week, the
annual, and rather
distasteful, discussion as to
who deserves, and who
does not deserve Colours
has ended again. I cannot
help but wonder whether
the whole business is
necessary; what does the
Union gain by awarding
colours, and, more
importantly, what could we
be losing?
Colours are meant as a
recognition by one's peers
of work done for the Union
and theorectically any
member of the Union can
nominate anybody else for
Colours. In practise,
however, it is those in
charge of the various
groups and clubs that do
this nominating, and it is
the same people that sit on
the various Colours
committees that decide
which awards are made,
and which are rejected.
Any 'appeal' has to be
made to Union Council,
where we get the situation
that happened at Council
recently; very heated
attacks against
nominations. I am not sure
that it is possible to
discriminate between this
and personal attacks when
you are at the meeting;
what impression can you
expect someone not at the
meeting who only hears the
'gossip' to get?
The problem with
Colours, or any form of
peer recognition is that you
have to be careful to keep
personalities out of it. If
members of the group
begin to get the impression
that they are not getting
recogniton because a small
minority of their peers,
perhaps the leaders, are
holding personal grudges
then any such system can
only lead to bitterness and
divison. Unfortunately I
think we have reached that
state within the Union.
Even a club captain, with
the best will in the world,
can fall foul of this if they
award Colours a large
number of people, some of
those awarded think that
their award has been
devalued because other
members (who they think
do not deserve Colours)
have been awarded them. If
you only award to a few,
then those who miss out
are upset. In cases like this,
having a good intention is
not good enough, fair play
has to be seen to be done,
and this is very difficult.
I believe we should
seriously consider the
future of the Social Colours
system within the Union;
certainly there should be a
re-evaluation of the
benefits and the
drawbacks.
Yours,
Chris Martin.
