Where's It All Gone
Yup, it's that time again.
You look at your bank
balance, then work out how
much money you have
spent this term and think
"where has it all gone?'.
External Affairs Officer
Gren Manuel conducted
our very own IC Union
survey last term, and using
the results of this and that
wonderful C D C computer
has found the answer. All is
revealed in his personal
commentary.
A few weeks ago I
commented on a survey
made by the University of
London on income and
expenditure of students in
the whole of the University.
Now its time to narrow the
field down a little and
present the results of the
survey done on students at
IC.
About 500 forms were
sent out, that's to 10% of
College. I got about 100
back (thanks to those who
returned them, to those
who didn't: don't complain
that IC Union doesn't care
what you think).
Government policy: who cares?
fact only eight people were
living in accommodation
costing less than £25/week.
Although the figure is
meant for guidance only, it
is clearly too little. In fact
only the availability of
cheap College
accommodation, in
particular in Evelyn
Gardens, prevents this
figure from being a lot
higher. In the private sector
£30 is the usual rate, with
many paying more. That
should keep the Housing
Benefit people busy
(incidentally I've just
received my Xmas HB—is
this a record?)
Rent: Rents averaged
£27.33 per week. For many
of these figures I computed
separate data for home
UGs—this is not because
home UGs are more
important than other
students but to enable
some objective assessment
to be made of the
Government grant. Home
1
UGs living away from home
1
averaged £29.33 per week.
The London U G grant
includes £21 for rent. In
Other Spending: Mr/Ms
normal student spends
£14.40 on food (which,
according to my
calculations will buy 3
burgers per day from the
Union Snack Bar).
Therefore food and rent for
the home U G make up
nearly £45 out of a £60
grant per week, with
clothes, entertainments and
travel yet to come.
Entertainments averaged
£10.40 (which includes
sports etc as well as the
more obvious beer and
fags).
Spending on clothes
averages £3.20 a week
(although a look at any
group at IC students makes
this figure seem impossibly
high), and on textbooks is
£1.80/week.
Travel is more tricky.
Many walk or cycle of
course and so incur no
travel costs above shoe
leather or the occasional
new set of tyres. The
average cost of travel is
£2.55. For the 39% of home
UGs who incur travel costs
the typical amount thrown
down the drain is £6.08.
Some of you may
remember that once upon a
time home students could
claim travel costs above
£50/year from their LEA.
This was replaced two
years ago with a flat once
only increase in the grant
of £110. Since then grants
have risen 5%, while fares
(in London) rose by more
than this in last January's
increase.
The flat increase in the
grant was fairly small
anyway, but the excuse of
'reducing administration
costs' no longer carries any
weight. As was predicted at
the time the government
just wanted to save some
cash by cutting the
jstardard of living of
students.
Benefit: It is interesting that
of those eligible (home
students) about half claim
housing benefit). The
Government is attempting
to change the rules
regarding HB (translation:
make you poorer) at the
moment, with those not
living in College
accommodation losing
about £150 in a year on
average it will be
interesting to see if
pretence at fairness lasts
for as long.
There was quite a bit of
other info gleaned from the
forms about IC Union's
priorities etc but you're all
dying to finish this piece
and get on to the film
reviews section, so I'll stop.
Needless to say that the
whole point of the survey
was to try and get IC Union
more responsive to its
members preferences, and
more able to represent their
interests. If anyone has any
questions on the results
then please seek me out
(please someone ask me
something) or I will be only
too pleased to send anyone
who wants one (staff or
students) a summary of the
results.
