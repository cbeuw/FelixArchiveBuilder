BECAUSE COLLEGE
LASTS FOR MORE THAN
A YEAR, SO DOES
YOUR INTEREST FREE
OVERDRAFT.
At Midland, we know how
difficult it is to make your grant last the
whole term.
That's why we can offer all our
student customers an interest-free
overdraft of up to £400.
And, unlike other overdraft
facilities, it r e m a i n s interest-free the
whole time you're at college.
You'll also enjoy free banking too.
Which means you won't pay a penny in
bank charges regardless of whether or
not your account is in credit.
However, on the occasions when
it is, you'll be pleased to learn that w e
pay y o u a handsome rate of interest on
the balance. (Just compare our rates to
other banks.)
Naturally we'll also give you an
Autocheque card so that you can get
cash 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
from any one of a network of around
5,000 machines.
And if you can handle credit,
there's also the option of applying for a
fee-free Visa or Access card.
So if you're looking to open your
first bank account call in at any branch
of Midland and ask about our special
services for students.
We'll give you all the help and
advice you need plus a cash bonus to
get you started.
