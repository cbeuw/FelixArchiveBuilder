If you are reading this magazine as
a new student at Imperial College,
I pity you. I have been here for
three years, and in that time, had
the trust that even though College
and Government were messing with
students, at least someone was
standing up for the your point of
view. You have lost that guarantee.
As reported exclusively on the
news pages of Felix, the Minister
for Education will make an
announcement on Wednesday about
how student unions will be funded.
It is expected that the 'Voluntary
Principle' will form the major part
of this statement. The 'Voluntary
Principle' is the right to choose
whether you join a students union,
when you go to university. Sounds
innocuous enough, but if the
statement was re-worded 'Do you
want £ 8 0 more grant or to join the
students union?' Which would you
go for?
How are you, who have just
arrived at university and in most
cases never been near a students
union, meant to make a sensible
choice on this? You have never
needed to see a welfare advisor,
been to the bar, had a problem with
Felix 942
your department or joined one of
the clubs and societies. Just think
how far your 'extra' £80 would
stretch if you tried using equivalent
facilities outside of your union. A
trip to a local pub should prove the
point.
I cannot say that students unions
are perfect, they are not, but at least
if you are given a. choice you have
duty to make an informed decision.
Make sure you get involved in some
level of the students union. Then
make the choice whether it is worth
the money that college has invested
on your behalf.
