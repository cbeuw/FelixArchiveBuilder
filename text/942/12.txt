John Hughes says that the
staggering of the sessions is
deliberate. The Pimlico Connection
offers new horizons not only to first
years, but also to other
undergraduates and postgraduates.
The training timetable is as flexible
as possible to accommodate these
students, and of course, they only
have to attend one of the sessions.
After that, he says, they will be able
to try something different.
â€¢ The Pimlico Connection is
running three briefing sessions and
four training sessions throughout
the next fortnight. Volunteers need
only attend one of each. All sessions
are in Mech Eng, room 703. Follow
the signs out of the lift.
