So You Want To Have Fun?
This is the place where the fun
begins. Here to relieve the tedium
and drudgery of normal college life
is RAG. What's that then I hear
you cry. R A G is Fun. R A G is
Crazy. R A G is Big. R A G is Free.
R A G is about Tiddlywinking down
Oxford Street, Live Monopoly,
Beer Festivals, Bungee Jumping,
Freebies and Excellent Prizes. R A G
is about having a laugh and doing
it for charity. Just to prove it take
a look at the line up for the first
term.
Tiddlywinks 10/10/92
Yep, that's this weekend! Join
hundreds of crazy students (that
means YOU) armed with R A G cans
and tiddlywinks and set off down
Oxford Street. Tiddling under feet,
round lamp posts, across roads,
over Taxis and amazing tourists into
handing over loadsa money. Follow
this up with Ring-a-ring-a-roses
round Eros and round the day off
with a mammoth attempt to drink
a pub dry.
Live Monopoly 17/10/92
The second event of term will see
you joining thousands of students
from across the country on the
streets of London. You have the
amazing opportunity to play this
classic board game on the largest
board in the U K . Get a team of 4
to 6 together and run around
London trying to visit all the
locations on the board, answer the
clues,and collect treasure whilst
avoiding the roving jail van.
There's Chance and Community
Chest cards around to help too.
Mencap throw a party in the
evening for all the days collectors
and prizes are handed out. Fancy
winning a skiing trip in Andorra?
This is the event for you.
RAG Raid 24/10/92
Another great freebie from RAG.
R A G raids involveing jumping in a
minibus and whizzing off to another
part of the country to collect there.
You get a free trip to wherever, see
the sites, terrorise the locals, un-
used to IC R A G antics, then whizz
back to the safety of the City Smog.
This R A G raid will be followed by
yet another storming free party
courtesy of UNICEF featuring three
live bands and a disco.
Pavement Climb
If you thought Tiddlywinks was
crazy you are not going to believe
this. Its quite simple and straight
forward even a Civil Engineer can
understand it. Attached precariously
to your climbing partner with
nothing more than a piece of
rope/string/elastic you will attempt
to climb a shear horizontal
pavement. Sounds strange? Just
wait 'til you see it! This event will
also be followed by a party - A
Rocky Horror Disco with a reduced
price ticket available to the days
collectors. So be there or be a
lemming!
Well that's October finished with
and if you're still alive after that
little lot the rest of the term is set
out opposite on your wonderful cut-
out and keep R A G Term Timetable
- the only timetable worth having.
Don't forget that R A G isn't just
free but that you can also win
stunning prizes. We also run an
incentive scheme with exclusive
mugs, T-Shirts, Sweat-shirts, and
tankards available only to
collectors.
If you want to know more come
and see us at freshers fair (we're in
the union building) or come up to
the R A G office (2nd floor, east
staircase in the union building)
otherwise any lunchtime come to a
R A G meeting at 1:10 on Friday in
the Union Building. Best yet turn
up to your C C U office on Saturday
10th October at 10:30am and
experience R A G first hand.
Prizes will be up for grabs for the
best hall and best C C U for the year
so get together with your hall R A G
rep. and see what other crazy ideas
you can come up with. We're game
for anything and maybe your hall
could win an end of year party on
R A G .
BE MAD! BE SILLY!
BE PART OF IT!
