A Gliding Tale
It's official—Imperial College
Gliding Club is the best university
gliding club in the country after
successfully capturing the inter-
university shield from Cambridge
University. The competition was
attended by seven college gliding
clubs and was held at Saltby in
Lincolnshire. The soaring
conditions were poor all week-
typical inter-university task week
weather.
A week later and our splendid
new two seat glider was in action
again for the 1992 Lasham
regionals, a nine day competition
held at our home airfield. Lasham
in Hampshire. In the best soaring
conditions of the year so far, many
thousands of competition kilometres
were clocked up by the field of 50
gliders.
I now describe a flight made by
myself and Martin Judkins, and
ICGC instructor around a 367km
task on 28th July—a day to
remember.
The day dawned clear and dry,
and soon the temperature was
climbing rapidly. By 10am small
puffs of cumulus cloud appeared
overhead—the ideal start to a super
soaring day. After attending the
customary briefing we strapped
ourselves into the glider and in a
short time we were airborne, being
towed to 2000 feet by the small tug
aeroplane. The air was turbulent
and convective and after releasing
the tow rope we rapidly climbed to
cloudbase which was already at
4000 feet and rising. The thermal
lift was strong at 5 to 8 knots (1 knot
= 100 feet per minute).
We started at 11.18am on the first
leg of the task; Lasham to the
disused WW2 airfield at Westcott,
about 70km due north. We soon
passed Aldermaston on our left and
then the M4 motorway. On a day
like this we could zoom at 80 knots
between thermals and then pull up
the lift, slowing to 45 knots and
only bothering to circle in the
meatiest bits of lift. This highly
efficient cruising technique is called
'dolphining'. We covered the
ground quickly and arrived at
Westcott at 12.23. The next leg
took us west 50km to another
disused airfield, Moreton-in-the-
Marsh. This leg took us over Upper
Heyford air base whom we had to
call on the radio—acknowledged by
the usual American 'Roger, have a
nice day'. It was here that we met
about 15 gliders coming the other
way from a national contest out of
Bristol. As they flashed by on our
left we exchanged greetings as is
customary in the gliding world, and
carried on. After Moreton we
turned N E towards Leicester, via
the motorway junction at Rugby.
Flying around here one realises just
how many military installations
there are—definitely not a place to
land at except if you like prisons!
After the old V-bomber base at
Gaydon slippe beneath our wings
Rugby was reached. Next was the
short leg to Leicester and then home
via Westcott again. Easy, or so we
thought. As we headed south the
sky looked distinctly less
promising—it was going 'blue', that
is where the thermals do not reach
the condensation level so no clouds
form. Glider pilots have to be more
wary when his happens and look for
ground features for sources of lift.
Then, south of Silverstone racing
circuit we found a stubble fire—the
glider pilot's friend. The variometer
(rate of climb instruments) went off
the clock as we rapidly climbed to
5,400 feet in the acrid, smokey
column. We still had 90km to go
and our groundspeed had slowed.
The chances of a win were slipping
away. We continued south, crossing
the M40 at about 2000 feet and
were looking at fields to land in
when as luck would have it we
found another stubble fire. We
needed 6000 feet to glide the 50km
back to Lasham, into a sea breeze
induced headwind. Controlled
airspace limited our climb to 5000
feet which meant we had to grovel
around for the last few kilometres.
The finish is very exhilarating—
nose down and speed on to
120knots, pull up over the trees on
the airfield boundary and cross the
line at 50 feet before peeling off and
landing.
Overall we placed third for the
day and, but for the grovel at the
end, we might have won. We had
covered 367km (see map) in 5 hours
55 minutes—not bad without an
engine.
I hope this article has given you
a taste for what gliding is about. It's
cheap (this trip cost only £32) and
it's great fun. Join the gliding club,
we meet in Aero 266 on Thursdays
at 1.00pm. See you there.
