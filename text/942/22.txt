Reaper by Graham Hurley
The IRA are planning revenge.
Something big, something
unexpected in order to make the
Brits sit up and think about the ten
men that they let die in the Hunger
Strikes. Reaper is the mind behind
it all. Out for their blood are MI5,
the RUC, 19th Army Intelligence
and every other British intelligence
agency. It doesn't help that they are
against each other as well. Dragged
forcefully into all this is Buddy
Little, who determined to somehow
find new life for his beautiful but
crippled wife. I found that the book
was well written, with new and
interesting characters becoming
involved in the plot as the story
moves on. It puts a new light upon
the IRA showing them to be clever
as well as ruthless, with a fierce
love for their country. I recommend
that you read this book and add little
interest to your time.

This book claims to contain all of
M . C . Eschers paintings and
drawings, and by the huge number
of pictures within its covers, I can
well believe this. It is truly a
wonderful anthology of all of his
works, and as an Escher fan. I
found it hugely interesting. The
accompanying text covers his life as
well as the drawings themselves; all
this being broken into useful
chapters in a chronological order,
encompassing his travels and
working life giving an insight into
this master of perspective.
The book is in portfolio form
with a paperback cover. It is fairly
expensive for a paperback, but the
quality of reproduction of all the
600+ prints is very commendable,
several (36) being in full colour. If
you are interested in Escher prints
then this is the present definative
work of his work and is well worth
the investment here. Brilliant.

Out to Lunch by Tania
Kindesley
'Sex and shopping' said the Felix
Book Editor, Sam, as she passed me
'Out To Lunch'. It's a wonderful
description. Venice and Alabama
are two sisters who live at opposite
ends of the London scene.
Devastating Venice, having been
fired from her third job in a month,
decides that she would simply have
to find a sugar daddy!
The CIA—A History by John
Ranelagh
After reading this book I am sad
that I missed the BBC series of the
same title. For someone like myself
who knew nothing on the subject of
the CIA, I now feel that I can hold
my own in any discussion regarding
them. It starts from the very basics,
the very beginning and goes
through to record the events that
lead them to become the
organisation that they are today.
The author has assumed that his
readers have no current knowledge
of the CIA workings which made
Alabama, the hard working
playwrite, falls for Max, a young
actor, whom she discovers in
Croydon. Obviously a party is
called for and Oliver is the man to
throw it.
But do the sisters know what they
really want, and why are there very
few places in London that really
know how to make a Bloody Mary?
I loved this book - go and read it
now!
Toby Jones.
the book very simple to read. The
book has been divided into blocks
of years which Mr. Ranelagh
obviously thought played very
important roles in the forming of the
CIA and in these sections has also
described what was occuring in the
rest of the world - helpful for those
of us whose history is rather weak
in places. For anyone with even a
minimal interest in the workings of
the secret services world wide, I
would recommend this book. It was
informative, enlightening and
generally an all round good read.

Tokaido by Lucia St Clair
Robson
Set in the time of Old Japan, the
story is about Lady Asano, the
daughter of Lord Asano who was
disgraced into committing ritual
suicide. Lady Asano sets off on a
journey down the Tokaido Road to
Kyoto, to find her fathers old
lieutenant, seeking revenge on her
fathers enemy..
However, I found that the book
wasn't just another revenge story.
It shows the change of Lady
Asano's character from a proud and
pretentious samurai, to a cleverer
and more humble person. She
changes from being a respected
courtesan to a hunted runaway, who
disguises herself as a disciple, a
pilgrim, a priest and a peasant as
she travels on.
The book is well written, with
pieces of Zen and other wise, old
sayings dotted everywhere
throughout the book. It does,
however, get tedious at times but it
is still a book worth reading.

The Rector's Wife by Joanna
Trollope
This book was about how Anna
Bouvrie stuggles against the
prejiduce inflicted by the small
parish in which she and her family
lives. Her husband, the Rector,
retreated into an isolated bitterness
after failing to gain his promotion.
Her daughter, being constantly
bullied at her school, caused Anna
to rebell. She took a job in a local
supermarket in order to send her
daughter to a private school and
escape the boredom of her home
life.
The new Anna was admired by
three men, newcomers to the
parish, giving her the opportunity
to explore her sexuality, something
she had been unable to do with her
husband.
The plot was of no particular
interest, to any one or anything, yet
vaguely interesting. Not a book I
would readily recommend to
anyone, yet for a long train journey
it'll do.
