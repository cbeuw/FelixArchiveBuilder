Television
Fuck off Television. If it's not bad
enough that the British Punk
pensioners (Shaw 69, Chelsea, UK
Subs, Vibrators, 999) are fast
wending their way onto the same
social club circuit as Gerry and the
Pacemakers and the Marmalade, we
now get a new album from Tom
Verlaine and his American
compatriots.
Always T H E seminal (fruitcake
covered with marzipan) punk band
from across the big pond (you can
keep your Ramones, Cramps, and
your Blondies), Television will
always haunt if only for the brilliant
'Fox Hole' and the accompanying
footage shown on the Old Grey
Whistle Test back in '78. And,
fourteen years on, they're back.
Verlaine returns with a Lloyd Cole-
ish lilt (or is that the other way
round), and on 'Call M r Lee',
caresses with a cactus guitar.
It's a sad indictment to the dearth
of Great Songwriters that the only
two decent albums to come out this
year are from XTC (another
Bastard Punk offspring) and
Television; this is a good but not
great album. And yet, '1880 or so'
displays a dangerous emptiness,
whilst 'Shane she wrote this' just...
... .Oh Fuck off Television. You
put us all to shame.

Bananrama
Very. The absolutely. Those crap
adolescent fantasy maidens are
back, relaunched, (sic) as a Duo.
The pertinent question, the one
we're all asking, is, 'have the gals
broke free of Stock Aitken and
Waterman, to pursue new heights
of artistic integrity and challenging
musical forms?'. Ha. Like fuck
they have. Big surprise there, eh
readers?
Surprise no 2 is the record,
another biggie here, kids. Yep,
you're right, it's bollocks. They've
also opted for what must be their
worst career move yet, and learned
to sing. They, no doubt, perceived
the deficiency left by Anne
Hathaway, or was there a
Shillileagh Sister in there too?
Maybe we'll never know... Perhaps
it's best not to. 'Bye, Bananas, you
will always, have always been,
could never be anything but...

REM: Drive
I had really fallen out with R E M .
I remember the Christmas of 1987,
two songs paramount in my head.
One was 'This Corrosion', typically
enough; the other was 'The One I
Love', a gorgeous wounded love
song full of bitterness. I bought
'Eponymous' soon after. A
beautiful and beguiling love affair
ensued; I discovered 'Fables of the
Reconstruction', and lost myself in
it. 'Out of Time' was a complete
betrayal.
So, it was a harder, more bitter
mind that demanded R E M to
engage it. 'Drive' is typical
simplicity, delicate and basic,
Michael Stipe reciting in an echoing
monotone of forced calmness. It's
their best single since 'The One I
Love', as awkward, bitter and
jarring as 'Feeling Gravity's Pull',
as simple and beautiful as 'Maps
and Legends'. Making up is half the
fun, isn't it? This is a truly great
song, and a truly great band. May
I never wake up.

Bedazzled: Sugarfree
What a wanky name. Yeah, right,
Bedazzled. So bewildered you
couldn't even play your
instruments. This album is an
absolute horse's arse of a record;
not even music by numbers, more
like join the dots. It's been
described as 'seminal'. Well, kids,
so are the stains on your duvet.
I really am not inclined to give this
crap the time of day, and if I hear
'teenage mother superior, why
don't you just switch off your
television set and go out and do
something less boring instead' (they
don't sing that. It would be funny
if they did) I'm going to make them
eat this sugarfree, which, by the
way, translates as saccharin
overload, fuckfest. Humbug!!

Fetch, The Railway Children
Amid the cackles and whispers of
'arselicker', as I believe is the
current P.C. term for a fawning
lackey, I must say that this review
comes to you on behalf of one
prepared to do 'the decent thing'.
I think Fetch deserve a break.
They deserve more than they've
got because they're the best band on
tonight. For your benefit, the others
were former indie favourites the
Railway Children, and another
much lauded band whose... whose
name escapes me, but whose
fondness for swirling noise
sculptures was as conspicuously
evident as their rip-off of the

Fetch: eerie haircut, spooky
Cranes. A few post-goth industrial
types had turned up to have a wank
to them. Not me. I'm a Steely Dan
man.
The point is that for all this
supposed nobility, Fetch are the
only band who actually project a
mood, engage their audience, play
an intelligent set. They aren't
brilliant (One might say they play
likeness.
'charismatic' with competence
rather than charisma), but they piss
all over any one of five hundred sad
fuckwits I could name. Speaking of
which... You need teeth to take a
bite of the cherry, and the Railway
Children can but suck. These twats
disgust me.
