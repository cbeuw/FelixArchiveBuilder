A large amount of the information contained in this edition of Felix can be found in the
Imperial College Union Handbook. Every incoming student should have one, "but if you
do not or you are not a first year but want to read it anyway, copies are available in the
Union Office. Simply produce a Union card, ask politely and a handbook will be yours.
