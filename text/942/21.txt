Reviewing the Reviewers
The greatest bonus of being
involved in Felix is reviews. Most
Film, Theatre, Art and Music
events in London can be seen for
free if you will write a review for
Felix. All we ask of you is 150
Catherine

Intrepid fresher chap or chapess,
prepare yourself for an introduction
to an enigma; do not be dissuaded
by others who would tell you that
Catherine is a monstrous
dominatrix, who would render you
to a jelly in comfortable non- sexist
shoes with one steely stare. She is
like that, but you know to prepare
now. Catherine is discerning,
words of your own opinions on
what you saw.
This offer is open to every student
at Imperial if you want to take
advantage of it. Below are the
people to contact. Each one is
demanding, in fact, every attribute
you can apply to a perfectionist
applies to her, whether she achieves
perfection or not. She is deceptively
engaging, is also excellent
company, likes a good chat, a
smoke or a beer. You couldn't have
your head bitten off by a nicer
person.

Once described as a 'little pixie',
often described as 'bubbly' I would
class myself as one of the louder
members of the Felix crew. What
more can I say? The red head

Theatre
Lady Aoi
Lady Aoi is a modern Noh play. It
is an adaptation of an 11th century
traditional Japanese play made by
Mishima in 1950. He explains these
works as 'a modern interpretation
of the situations found in the dramas
of Noh'. It is presented by
Chardonnay productions which is a
unique international company
combining Japanese and European
actors and staff.
The production incorporates
music and movement to the play
whilst maintaining the essence of its
original spirit. The theme is the

anyway.

interested should contact Felix.
torment of two women's souls for
the love of one man. Undoubtedly
the best performance is due to Kate
Richmond as Lady Aoi. Although
she doesn't say a word all through
the play her dance and movements

minutes that the performance lasts.
It is an interesting play overall

words or the words of someone who
wishes to stab them in the back.
The Felix Office is open most of
the week, so there is no excuse not
Mario —Film
to get in contact. This could be the
last time someone offers you the
chance to see all the free films,
theatre and art possible with not a
penny cost to yourself.
Mario is by far and away the most
tastefully dressed of any reviews
editor, sneering down on those clad
in traditional student garb, the
sartorial power of this man is
matched only by his position in
Felix. Quietly, with a cutting wit,
this dapper gent wields the most
prized of reviews posts, that of film
reviews editor. If you want to go
and see Alien 10 or Dr Who, the
movie, this is the knee at which you
must fawn.
Unfortunatly his hectic clothes
shopping timetable means he cannot
go and see every new film in
London. This means there are lots
of spare tickets for anyone who
wants to become involved in
reviewimg films.

Welcome, and you've heard that
word before, to what could in all
likelihood, be the worst three, four,
five, then years of your life. They
could be. They don't have to be, but
Y O U , (You there, at the back. Sit
up and listen to me), yourself have
to do something about it. The world
isn't going to come and entertain
you. You're in London now, and
London doesn't give a fuck. It is
quite prepared to endure without
any cognizance of your very
existence. And this is where we
come in, to notify you of what's
happening (dude), and what has
happened, what's worth spending
your gift from the government on,
and conversely, what's not.
Of course, you don't actually
have to splash out to get records,
CDs, tickets, videos, beer, sex,
drugs, rock, roll, etc. You can get
them free. That's where we come
T H E C A T C H
There had to be one, of course. But
it's not that big. No really. All we
want is for you, the freebie
endowed student, to write about it.
We want you to be a journalist. We
want you to write a review. Pause
for effect. Food for thought.
SO W H A T DO I DO NOW?
Unpack your suitcase. Buy an A to
Z. Tune your radio to X F M 100.5.
Ask someone what they got in their
A-Levels. Get your grant cheque.
Then, preferably during daylight
hours, wander into the Beit Quad,
cast a discerning eyeball around
until you espy the word Felix,
enter, and say something along the
lines of 'Where's Mr. Poddy?' I
wish to become one of the elite
throng that is a Felix musoperson.'

Advisor.
