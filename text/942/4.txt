The best time of your life?

Fresher's Week '92. Do you want
to see top bands at ridiculously
cheap prices? Top comedy,
fairground attractions, cocktails,
casinos and lots and lots of fun?
Well, read on .... We've got three
large events on the Monday,
Wednesday and Friday of Fresher's
Week (5th - 9th October).
Headlining in the Concert Hall on
Monday night will be Sunscreem.
Hot on the heels of their recent chart
smash 'Love U More' (as seen on
TOTP), and with their new single
'Perfect Motion' set to be an even
bigger smash, they'll be playing a
live set crammed full of frantic
dance music. Described as 'the
ultimate indie-dance crossover,
they'll be supported by hot new
dance act Hysterix, with Dave
Valentine and Vicky Red playing
the latest club tunes into the early
hours at Club Atmosphere.
Downstairs on Monday will be
Perspex Whiteout, often compared
to Alex Chiltern and Teenage
Fanclub and in fact often
namechecked by Norman Blake
himself. They are one of our hottest
up and coming bands on the indie
circuit. Don't miss them.
Also on Monday we'll have a late
bar, disco 'till 3am, cocktails and
fairground attractions.
On Wednesday you'll have a
chance to laugh off the hangover
blues with three top comedians
from the London comedy circuit -
Ian Cognito, Mark Maier and
Wilty. Ticket holders for this event
must arrive no later than 8.15pm
otherwise we cannot guarantee your
entrance. There will be a late bar
and disco 'till lam after the
comedy.
In the Concert Hall on Friday
night will be the Nutty Boys. This
band consists of two former
members of Madness, fresh from
their two sell-out dates at Finsbury
Park this summer, and with their
own unique blend of Ska, this
year's party band are bound to set
the house on fire. They'll be
supported by the Time Wasters, a
fresh London soul band who'll be
sprinkling their set with choice
Blues Brothers Numbers.
In the Lounge on Friday night are
The Rockingbirds. Straight from
their headlining performance at
Reading festival and a recent H T V
special, they'll be playing their
unique mix of pop, country and
rock music. So get your stetsons
and cowboy boots out kids, and
remember there'll be space to park
your horse. Again, there'll be
cocktails, casinos, late bar and disco
'till 3am.
Tickets for Monday and Friday
night are £6 each and tickets for the
Comedy night (if any seats are
available) will be £4 on the door.
But, a special offer is available -
buy a week ticket for £12 and get
into all three events (a saving of £4).
These tickets usually sell out
before the events, so buy your
tickets now or read this and weep.
If you've ordered Fresher's Week
tickets by post, remember to pick
them up at the Union office no later
than 5.00pm on Monday 5th
October.
