Careers-Why worry now?
Dear Fresher.
Welcome to Imperial College.
The next three or four years should
be among the most interesting and
enjoyable in your life, provided you
make the most of the opportunities
available at College. This letter
aims to give you some ideas for
your own self-development.
You can probably recall one of
the significant steps in your life
when you entered the sixth form or
went to sixth form college. Coming
to College is an even more
significant step. You have freedom,
more independence and more
opportunities to do your own thing
and to succeed or fail. If you do not
make some mistakes you will not
have learnt anything, learning from
one's own mistakes is an important
part of experience, but don't waste
time reinventing everything—build
on the experience of others—take
advice (it's usually free)—ignore
some of it, test it out accept it or
reject it.
You have already demonstrated
some planning ability by passing
'A' Levels—or their equivalent—
sufficiently well to be at College.
How are you going to plan the next
three, four or six years? And I'm
not talking just about your academic
studies, I'm talking about the start
of the rest of your life.
What do you want to achieve this
term? Making friends is usually
high on most people's list. How?
Join clubs and societies, attend
meetings, take up a new sport,
develop a new interest—any of
these are likely to bring you into
contact with like-minded students.
And there's always the bar to prop
up while seeking inspiration.
By the end of the summer term
in your first year you are feeling the
financial pressure—in other words
you're broke! So how about earning
some good money in the long
vacation. If you leave job hunting
until the vac starts you may be too
late. All the interesting and lucrative
jobs have been filled already and
you will be lucky if the local council
wants some grass cutting or the
garden centre needs a dirty pair of
hands. It's well worthwhile doing
some preliminary job hunting
between Christmas and Easter. Call
in at the IC Careers Service (Room
310, Sherfield Building) where you
will find information about
Vacation Training, write to
employers with your C V , call in to
some local shops and hotels and see
who's advertising in the local press.
Vac jobs can be most
informative. Ideally they give you
the chance to try out some type of
work or future employer in which
you are interested. They give you
experience in job hunting, letter
writing and interviews, as well as
a real insight into what it's like to
work for a particular type of
employer. Some even pay you quite
well. Jobs abroad are popular and
early applications are essential.
Start by visiting the IC Careers
Service which has a good range of
reference books and addresses.
At the start of the second year you
raise your sights higher. Now is the
time to test your skills in organising
something—a social evening for
your department, looking after the
finances of a society or fixtures
secretary of your team. That sounds
too much like hard work I hear you
say. Yes, it does take some effort
on your part but generally speaking
the more effort you put into
something the more enjoyment you
will get out of it.
Committee work is excellent
preparation for life after College.
You learn to set agendas, run
meetings, agree actions, persuade
other students to do things, work
within budgets and end up with a
successful event—a party, a visit,
a play or a newspaper. (Think how
much effort went into producing
this edition of 'Felix')
You should start thinking
seriously about your future career
before the end of the second year.
Even if you haven't a clue what you
want to do, that's no excuse for
delaying finding out about the
possibilities. You are surrounded
with sources of information-
friends, family, tutors, careers
advisers, libraries. Start looking. It
may be a long process but so is life,
so it really is worth spending more
time thinking about your career than
planning your next weekend or
holiday.
The IC Careers Service is a good
starting point. Pop in and speak to
the information staff. Find out about
'GRADSCOPE' and 'PROSPECT'
and all the information booklets and
reference files. Have a look at some
of the videos, attend some seminars
on careers, get yourself sorted out.
The Milkround visits by
employers are in the spring term of
your final year.
Christmas vacation courses are a
popular way of finding out about
careers such as marketing but only
a few major recruiters run them and
they are normally over-subscribed
many times.
Stop! I'm only a fresher—why
are you telling me ail this?
I'm telling you because you need
to start planning your degree now,
don't just drift through College and
emerge with a degree and nothing
else. Of course a degree is
important and must be your first
priority, but not your only priority.
In the meantime, enjoy yourself.

Careers Service.
