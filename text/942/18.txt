Libraries and the working student
Do you know that IC has a
Humanities and Music library? This
is the Haldane Library, currently
situated on level 2 of the Central
Libraries, but to be relocated to
more spacious premises on level l
during the Christmas vacation.
Open to all members of College, the
Haldane Library provides general
cultural and extracurricular reading,
and supports the teaching and other
activities of the Humanities
Programme. The collection has
grown from the time when H . G .
Wells urged students 'to show that
they were not barbarians', and now
numbers some 35,000 volumes, 70
newspaper and periodical titles, and
10,000 sound recordings, as well as
maps and music scores, most of
which can be borrowed. The library
is named after R.B. Haldane,
politician, philosopher and
educationalist, who was
instrumental in the merger of IC's
constituent colleges. His portrait
above the current periodicals
display adds some historial
atmosphere to the otherwise modern
and informal reading area.
The library is accessible from the
main Central Libraries entrance
from 9.30am to 9.00pm on
Mondays to Fridays, and from
9.30am to 5.30pm on Saturdays,
during term and Easter vacation. In
Christmas and Summer vacations it
is open from 9.30am to 5.30pm
Mondays to Fridays. The library
card, obtainable from the
registration desk on level 1 of the
Central Libraries, permits the
borrowing of up to four books
(including maps and music scores),
two records or cassettes (or one of
each), and two compact discs. For
CDs a contribution of 50 per issue
is requested: this is to provide for
further purchases and security in the
collection, which was set up by
means of grants and voluntary
contributions. Most books may be
borrowed for one term, and sound
recordings for three weeks; issue
and return are handled by the main
issue counter in the Central
Libraries entrance.
The Haldane Library aims to
cater for all tastes—from Aristotle
to Amateur Photographer—and it
would be impossible to describe its
contents exhaustively. Most
conspicuous are such subjects as
politics, history, travel, biography,
music, art history, philosophy,
literature, but there is much more
besides. There are, for example,
well-used sections on consumer

The new entrance to Imperial's libraries
matters, sport, genealogy,
transport, feminism, religion, and
humour. Beyond this it is well
worth a browse to discover some of
the curiosities, which, quite apart
from the fringes of psychology,
range from giants to Egyptian
grammar. Particularly popular
authors include Nostradamus, as
well as, more predictably, Umberto
Eco and Tom Wolfe. There is a
wide range of fiction, from classics
to the latest Booker prizewinner,
financed by the Students' Union and
usually selected by a student buyer.
The Music Library includes both
printed music—especially a good
selection of chamber music parts
and miniature scores—and sound
recordings. The classical music
collection—on record, cassette and
increasingly CD—is intended to
stimulate the new listener as well as
to satisfy more specialised taste.
Jazz, folk and popular recordings
on record and cassette are financed
by the Students' Union, and are
usually selected by a student buyer.
There are also language courses,
mostly on cassette, and some
spoken word recordings, including
Shakespeare.
Daily newspapers (The Times,
Financial Times, Guardian,
Independent, Telegraph, Le Monde
and Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung) are taken, as well as a
wide range of magazines and
periodicals (including Autocar and
Motor, Private Eye, New Left
Review, Newsweek, Great
Outdoors and Which?), some of
them financed by the Union. Some
subscription support taught courses,
notably history periodicals, Sfern,
and L 'Express. There are ordnance
survey and other maps, atlases, and
a good reference collection. In
addition, the library receives a
selection of publicity material of
theatres, concerts and other events
in London. The library also hosts
occasional poetry readings.
It remains to say that we welcome
new users, and are always glad to
assist with enquiries—tracing that
elusive quotation, for instance—and
to consider suggestions for new
purchases; we forward request for
new fiction titles and popular sound
recordings to the Union buyers,
who are still to be appointed for this
year. The Haldane Library staff are
Janet Smith, Haldane Librarian;
Jane Agnew, Senior Assistant; and
David Lascelles, half-time Music-
Assistant. We look forward to
meeting you!
Janet Smith.
