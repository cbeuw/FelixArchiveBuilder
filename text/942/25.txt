A Waste of Talent
And the game this week is 'You are
the lead singer of Fetch and I claim
my ten pounds'. Very funny.
Which of you self-congratulatory
bastards is it then? Let us look at
the facts here; some twat wrote that
shitty lard thing a few weeks back.
The same week I sent in my piece
on the origins of the surname
'Humphries'. Which got published?
Exhibit A.
Next, it was that Oh, so terribly
funny and not a bit in-jokey at all
'Who's run off with my
Wednesday'. Clever use of Tom
Baker, too; never heard that one
before, honest. Is it mere
coincidence that at the same time I
send in a piece concerning Douglas
Adams' ideas on the Blinovitch
Limitation Effect? Exhibit B.
Exhibit C is your front page story
concerning Stanhope. You
deliberately stuck in some untruths
just to fill out space, and you had
the added bonus of printing an
apology in the next issue. Guess
what? more space filled. I bet that
fucker who always wears Sisters of
Mercy T-Shirts has something to do
with this. But it's not just him, is
it? You're all in on this. As far as
you and your sickeningly
sycophantic world is concerned,
I'm an outlaw. I'm controversial;
I represent a radical challenge to
your recidivist nonsense, and you
don't like it. You're all so hacky
and chummy, you media types, lots
of 'Dahling Clarissa! How's dear
little Tigger and Smudge?'. It's like
Phil Collins selling millions of
records on his reputation as 'an
ordinary bloke', or rubbing tan shoe
polish into your hair. It doesn't
quite gel. You wouldn't publish my
hilarious and rip-roaringly funny
137-part 'Adventures in
Underpants', would you? You gave
A typical martian reaction to it.
me 'Yeah, yeah. Next decade'
every time I came into the office;
always fobbing me off, always
placating me. Well, it never
happened, did it?
Now, I have been accused of
dealing with the public in a manner
to which they are not accustomed.
It is true, there have been
misunderstandings. A notable being
my submission to the 'Confessions'
series of novellas, relating the tale
of the cloakroom attendant. It was
rejected, as the mystery of the
missing 17p and the half-pack of
mints was deemed too flimsy, but
I wanted to show how big a thing
guilt can be. You just don't
understand, do you? Your credits
will read, Thanks to Blurb for his
prolific talent, thanks to Hack for
being a terrific sounding board,
thanks to cough for coming into the
office and doing fuck all, but he's
Brian Cant before his extermination.
a mate and agrees with me lots,
thanks to splutter for his
extraordinary bottom, and thanks to
ahem for his comforting bad breath.
What about the poor jobbing writer?
Well, I'll tell you. My new book's
called 'Mickie Most: a life in pop'
and is a touching tale of his life,
love and hardship at the forefront
of the pop industry. He discusses
frankly the rivalry between Tony
Hatch and Derek Hobson as his
reason for leaving the cast of 'New
Faces', and the commercial disaster
of his updated hip-hop version of
the Goodies 'Funky Gibbon'. It'll
show those bastards at 'Woman's
Realm' who refused to publish the
serialized version of 'the Derek
Hobson Story', detailing his
friendship with Peters & Lee, and
the making of 'That's My Dog'. In
the pipeline, also, 'The Further
Adventures of Wayne, Topov, and
Hartley Hare' of T.V.'s 'Pipkin'
fame. There are still copies
available of my biography of Giant
Haystacks, entitled 'It's only a Job',
and deals mainly with his marriage
to Sheila, his 'Bad Guy' image and
his weight problem.
I don't care if you don't publish
this; I'm a superstar who's both
marvellous and less fat too.
No, you don't, you bastards! I
didn't write that. Play by the rules,
yeah? How can I be a self-publicist
if I don't generate my own
publicity? Eeh, you'll be the death
of me, all you Maeve Binchy/Irwin
Shaw acolytes, and the death of
quality literature, too. John Osborne
was right about writers; they're all
rotten sports. I was talking to a
writer the other day, a chap that did
ads for Crest toothpaste, and I told
him that he was a filthy pig
capitalising on the need for dental
hygiene. Alan Ayckbourn was
right, too, and his teeth were well
decayed, rotting in his mouth they
were. Christopher 'Superman'
Reeve and Steve 'Crystal Palace'
Coppell had similar problems too.
Lewis 'Bodie' Collins would've
done both jobs better, had he not got
involved with the Gay Serum Affair
and turned queer overnight. That's
another thing: who authorised that
centre page spread filled entirely
with Oscar Wilde's maxims? That
was certainly a little girly, and
wouldn't have happened if Peter
Duncan, Janet Ellis and Simon
Groom had been there to add that
little Blue Petery touch. Only they
could tell such stories as Art
Garfunkel's secret desire to be a
medium pace bowler for Pakistan,
or Glenda Jackson's longing to be
a pizza chef in a busy Italian
takeaway? Completely untrue,
probably, but only Janet Ellis and
Simon Groom can lend the most
wicked fibs a degree of sincerity
and a sense of conviction.
This is the kind of stuff that gets
ignored in the media, but these
people don't become stars for
nothing. Congratulations, by the
way, on hitting the national
consciousness again, this time in the
Times Higher Education
Supplement. The Editor's a mate of
yours, is he?
