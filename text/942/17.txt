Felix 942
The Dance Club sum up
5th October 1992
1991/92 was an extremely
successful year for IC Dance Club.
We continued to hold well
attended lessons in Latin American,
Rock 'n' Roll and Ballroom dancing
for all levels of ability. These
culminated in June when those
members who wished to take (and
passed!) dance 'exams'. Dance
Club isn't about passing exams
though, most people attend simply
because they enjoy dancing.
Dance Club has a thriving social
life (we're one of the few clubs to
have an almost l: l ratio of men to
women) and last year we held a
series of social dances so that
members could practice and get to
know each other outside of lessons.
These have proved to be very
popular and we shall be continuing
them this year.
The club has a competitive side
too and last year was a particularly
successful year for our dance teams.
They won practically every dance
competition going, including the
Inter Varsity Dance Association
(IVDA) competition of which we
are champions for the second year
running.
As well as winning all the
competitions; some of our team
members were lucky enough to be
able to go and represent the Club
at the 5th Annual USA/Britain
University Dance Festival in
Clearwater, Florida last year.
The Club is also active in
fundraising for charity and last year
the Club raised £2,100 for the
Children in Need Appeal through a
24 hour sponsored dance.
The year was rounded off with
our Annual Dinner & Dance, held
in college at the end of May which
was a very enjoyable evening with
excellent food, excellent dancing
and an impressive demonstration of
our teams winning form.
We can look forward to an even
brighter future this year under the
guidance of our new committee.
We'll be hosting the IVDA ball at
the Grosvenor House Hotel, Park
Lane (which we'll win of course!)
and we hope to increase the number
of classes and introduce new dances
too.
Whatever happens, it's sure to be
great fun so if you're at all
interested come along to one of the
lessons (see What's On and look out
for our posters) or else we'll see
you at the Freshers' Fair.
