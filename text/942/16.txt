The Balloon Club tempt you to the clouds
Which Imperial College club would
ask its members to get up at sunrise
and then subject you to standing
1.000 feet up in a basket? Well.
Balloon Club for starters...! But is
it worth it? I certainly think so.
Many people find that ballooning is
the most spectacular experience
they've ever had. It's a uniquely
peaceful and exciting way to fly.
A brightly coloured balloon
floating by always attracts carloads
of spectators and the envious waves
of early-morning dog walkers.
Inside the basket, you can watch
them all, wave back and enjoy the
feeling of the slight breeze on your
face. Ballooning makes other forms
of flying seem sterile.
The early morning starts are a
necessary evil if you want to catch
the calmest flying conditions. Most
of the year it's possible to fly twice
a day. once in the early morning
and once in the early evening. It
takes half an hour to rig up the
balloon ready for flight. When the
pilot (and sometimes a traineer
pilot) have completed their list of
safety checks, the lifeless shape of
the envelope is filled with cold air.
Then the burner roars and the
envelope begins to lift off the grass.
A few minutes later you're
airborne.
Takeoff in a balloon is very
gentle, unlike the noise and ear-
popping of takeoff in an aeroplane.
Standing in the basket, there's only
a sort of surreal awareness that the
ground is slowly dropping away
from you. The ground crew,
meanwhile, get back into the
minibus to follow the balloon's
course along the roads, which takes
some skilled navigating.
I won't kid you that you just pay
your membership fee and then
that's all the effort the club will ask
you to put in return for flights.
Balloon club manages to fly
everyone so cheaply because
everyone is asked to play their part
in getting the balloon airbourne.
You may well find yourself acting
as ground crew and not flying. But
you won't be forgotten. The real
bonus about flying with Imperial
College Balloon Club is the chance
to train as a pilot. Last year saw one

now an official pilot instructor, with

chance to experience the thrill of
ballooning for yourself.

Watersports
The Swimming and Waterpolo Club
is one of the largest and most
successfuly clubs at College. We
train twice a week, Mondays and
Fridays from 6.30-7.30pm. Train
is probably the wrong word as we
cater for all tastes, from those who
just fancy a paddle to those with
more masochistic tendencies.
Waterpolo training takes place
straight after and we encourage
anyone, even vaguely interested to
stay and give this exciting, fast
moving game a try. We have a
strong team, taking part in both
university competitions and the
local Middlesex league. New
players, beginners or seasoned
veterans are always needed and
most welcome. There is also an
active ladies team.
Socially each evening is rounded
off with a trip to the college bar,
each term with a club dinner and
each, year with a waterpolo tour. If
you wish to find out more contact
Gavin Davies, Physics PG II on
extension 6779.
