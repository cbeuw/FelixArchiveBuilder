The Department for Education
has refused to comment on reports
that a ministerial announcement on
voluntary membership for college
student unions may be made on
Wednesday.
Such an announcement would end
over eighteen months of speculation
on the Government's intentions,
and would come just three weeks
after a Freedom Association poll
showed that 71% of the public
favoured the ending of compulsory
student union membership.
Conservative Party sources have
indicated to the Imperial College
News Network, i C N N , that Nigel
Forman, the Higher Education
Minister, may tell this week's
Conservative Party Conference that
he intends to legislate against
compulsory membership of college
student unions. Currently, all
members of a college or university
are automatically members of the a
student union.
Jan Moore, a press officer for the
Department for Education, said that
the Conservative Party conference
was completely separate from
departmental business, and that she
couldn't possibly comment. This is
a similar argument used to deny the
existence of a students' charter in
January. Since then, a succession of
students' charters have been
published by higher education
institutions.
Senior figures in Conservative
Students have privately hailed the
reports as a 'significant victory',
and will be participating in the
Conference education debate on
Wednesday.
The reports follow a frantic
summer for the student union
movement. In June, a backbench
Conservative M P , Graham
Riddick, initiated a Commons
debate on voluntary membership on
student unions. Mr Riddick said that
it was 'indefensible' for students not
to have choice in joining student
unions. Mr Nigel Forman the
minister for Higher Education also
intimated that he would welcome
consultations on the matter of
voluntary membership, though no
official announcement of
consultations was made. These talks
were expected to merge with
ongoing consultations, initiated by
Kenneth Clarke on the subject
during his tenure as Secretary of
State for Education. / C N N

receiving consultations a week ago
Following the Commons debate,
the Adam Smith Institute, a right
wing policy group, published a
student charter. The National Union
of Students(NUS) claimed that the
Adam Smith document conceded
the 'right of student representation'.
The NUS is believed to be
considering a policy review. In
particular, Lorna Fitzsimons, the
N U S President, has publicly
supported a graduate tax, whereby
university graduates pay additional
taxes to cover the costs of their
education. Ms Fitzsimons has also
had discussion with an offshoot of
the Saatchi and Saatchi
organisation, centring on the public
perception of the NUS.
The principle of voluntary
membership was discussed by
several college unions throughout
the summer. Sheffield University
Students' Union published a draft
disscussion document for the
Higher Education Minister which
accepted the principle of voluntary
membership.
The Sheffield document was
attacked by other student unions,
Conservative Students, and the
NUS. The University of London
Union (ULU) is still trying to
formulate a response. Mark
Samuels, U L U President, called an
informal meeting of sabbaticals and
others on 21 September to discuss
the document. Non-binding draft
submissions from London colleges
are expected later in the term.
Imperial College Union is currently
working on a set of Documents to
be disscussed in the future. It is
believed that a final document may
be submitted to the Higher
Education Minister.
