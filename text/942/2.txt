Imperial to be medical 'Super School'
Imperial College is set to become
one of four medical 'super schools'
within the University of London.
The plan follows discussions at
meetings of the College Board of
Studies and Governing Body
Executive Committee, and is
detailed in a document submitted by
the University of London to the
government appointed Tomlinson
Enquiry. The Enquiry, under the
direction of Sir Bernard Tomlinson,
is looking at the provision of health
care in London with a view to
widespread rationalisation.
The centrepiece of the 'super
school' plan is a possible merger
between Imperial and the Charing
Cross Westminster Medical School,
currently based at Charing Cross
Hospital in Hammersmith. This will
be the second medical merger in
recent times. In 1988, Imperial
College of Science and Technology
merged with St. Mary's Hospital
Medical School in Paddington to
form the Imperial College of
Science, Technology and Medicine.
The possibility of a merger with
Charing Cross Westminster was
first revealed in May this year by
the then Imperial College Union
president, Zoe Hellinger. Ms
Hellinger said at the time that she
would produce a report for college
I — N e w s i n Brief
Governing Body, discussing 'the
wider effects of this merger on
students and the students' union'.
The author of the merger
proposal is Professor Peter
Richards, Pro-Rector of Medicine
and Dean of St. Mary's. Professor
Richards said in May that he had
submitted a report to the College
Board of Studies on a possible
merger. Copies of the minutes of
the Executive Committee meeting
of 20 March 1992 show that
Professor Richards had discussed
the prospect of a merger with the
Dean of Charing Cross
Westminster Medical School in
August 1991. Professor Richards is
recorded as saying that the pre-
clinical staff of Charing Cross
Westminster had agreed to the
formation of a single unit on the
South Kensington campus.
Professor Richards also added that,
after discussion with the Chief
Executive of the Universities
Funding Council (UFC) and Sir
Bernard Tomlinson, it had been
agreed to cover the cost of the
merger in part with funds raised by
the sale of buildings 'elsewhere'.
A merger between Imperial and
Charing Cross Westminster would
result in a medical school of 1,500
students. This compares in number
with some 2,000 engineers and over
1,700 scientists. Both Professor
Richards and Sir Eric Ash, the
College Rector, regard the move as
Imperial 'becoming the focus for
medical research and education in
West London'. The proposal to
merge is the basis of the submission
by Imperial College to the
Tomlinson Enquiry. In a letter to
Sir Bernard Tomlinson, Sir Eric
says that the proposal to form an
integrated Medical School has 'been
accepted in principle by the
Governing Bodies of Imperial
College and Charing Cross
Westminster Medical School.' Sir
Eric adds that 'it is our firm
intention to work towards the
formation of one integrated Medical
School. We are confident that we
would succeed.'
The submission by Imperial is
part of an overall submission by the
University of London to the
Tomlinson Enquiry, which was set
up in October 1991. The then
Health Secretary, William
Waldergrave, appointed Sir
Bernard Tomlinson as a special
advisor to the Departments of
Health and Education. Sir Bernard,
a former chairman of the Northern
Regional Health Authority, was
asked to advise on how health
bodies were 'addressing the
provision of health care in London'
within the framework of recent
NHS reforms. He was specifically
instructed to take account of
London's health needs, purchasing
plans of local health authorities, and
the need to maintain high standards
of medical teaching and research
and development.
The University of London
document details three other
mergers between multi- faculty
colleges and medical schools. This
is expected to lead to eight of
London's nine medical schools
being consolidated in four groups.
These groups would be focused on
Imperial in west London,
University College in north
London, Queen Mary Westfield in
east London, and Kings College
London in south London. The
University of London document
shows that University College is to
merge with the Royal Free Medical
Schools, Queen Mary Westfield is
to merge with the Medical Colleges
of the London and Barts Hospitals,
and Kings College is to merge with
the United Medical and Dental
Schools of Guy's and St. Thomas's
Hospitals.

Vice Chancellor of Manchester
University, have been dropped. The
Crown Prosecution Service said that
it was not in the public interest to
prosecute. Professor Harris had
been listed to appear before
magistrates on Tuesday. Greater
Manchester police said that an
enquiry was under way into how the
case was listed before a decision on
prosecution was taken. (The Times)
