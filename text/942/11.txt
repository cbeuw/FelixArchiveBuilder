Now that you've finally finished
with school, you might want to try
something different. You might
want to go back. Last year 130
Imperial students returned to the
classroom. They did not go as
pupils, nor as teachers. They were
different. They were Pimlico tutors.
They taught and learned. They
learned about interaction, about
communication, about science. By
getting out of college, most tutors
thought they had reinforced their
knowledge of their subject. Over
90% of these Imperial students felt
practised in the communication of
scientific ideas. Almost all felt they
were doing something useful with
their subject.
These were Imperial's Pimlico
tutors. Under the Pimlico
Connection, Imperial students have
gone back into classrooms right
across London since 1975. The
Pimlico Connection has been
widely acclaimed. The
'Independent' tells us that 'student
tutors have livened up lessons for
pupils in London'. Pimlico tutors
have been called 'pioneers in the
appliance of science', 'role model
students' and 'fuel for staying
power'.
Working individually or in small
groups, the tutors assist teachers in
local secondary and primary
schools. In almost all cases, this is
done on Wednesday afternoons for
between one and two terms. The
tutors provide extra help within a
class, working under the direction
and supervision of the class teacher.
'It's not a case of being thrown in
at the deep end,' says Chris Riley,
a former tutor. 'Tutoring does not
mean looking after a class of
between 20 and 30 children single
F e l i x 9 4 2
handed.'
Students, pupils and teachers all
tell of the benefits of tutoring.
Tutoring is also seen as a method
of promoting science and
technology, and of increasing the
numbers of children staying on in
education after 16. Industry is also
convinced of the value of tutoring.
In 1990, BP appointed John Hughes
as Fellow for Student Tutoring at
Imperial College, and charged him
with developing the scheme.
The organisation of student tutors
at Imperial is done by the tutors
themselves. The Pimlico
Connection is an Imperial College
Union society, run by an elected
'eature

committee. This year's chairperson,
Anita Ellis, says that tutors benefit
from regular newsletters and
subsidised social events such as
dinners and guest speakers. She
adds that the committee provides 'a
well defined back up in case
problems arise'.
The back up starts with training.
Throughout Freshers' Week and the
week after, John Hughes will be
running, no obligation training and
briefing sessions. The briefing
sessions will tell you about the
Pimlico Connection. If you like
what you hear, you can come back
for the training.
