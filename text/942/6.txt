Sabbaticals are students elected to
run and represent students for a
year. They are paid to do various
jobs in the students union, out of
money that you pay to the college
in fees. Every day you are at
college, a sabbatical is speaking on
your behalf to College managment
and running the students union for
your service.
Unfortunately, very few people
actually know who these mysterious
sabbaticals are. Others believe they
are figures that must be held in
some sort of awe, so cannot be
approached. This is rubbish. ,
Sabbaticals cannot represent'you
unless they know what you are
thinking. So, talk to them, harrass
them, demand to know what they
have done for you the student.
Below are descriptions of
Imperial College Union sabbaticals,
written by themselves about each
other, read what they have written
and see what you feel about those
who claim to represent you.
Chris Davidson President- By Jonty
Chris Davidson is a giant of a man;
when he enters a room grown men
cry, women faint and Julian Clary
feels ambiguous. How can the
English language contain the praise
due to this pillar of our community?
What a sad thing it is, that he is only
the President of a Students Union.
Surely greater things are calling to
him, or is it that he chooses to
illuminate our lives with his
presence?
When the Students of Imperial
College spoke with one voice to
elect him president, they made a
wise choice. Skilled as a diplomat,
an orator and a business man, each
day we spend in the Union is
guarded over by his watchful eye.
How can those that do not know
him appreciate what my feeble
utterings mean. My advice is go out
meet him, share in his
magnificence, before it vanishes
from all our lives when he moves
on to bigger and better things.
Can I have my Imagesetter now
please?
Rick Bilby Deputy President - by Chris
What can I say about Rick that has
not already been said, mostly by me
behind his back? Well despite being
a relative man mountain he has a
warm and considerate inner self that
he reserves for special occasions, in
fact so special that I have never seen
it.
A worrying recent development
in Rick's persona is today's attempt
at colour matching. He has
managed to match his clothes, it's
just that he is wearing a bright pink
shirt and boots???. This I think is
something to discourage in future.
This style guru of the 90's is fair
chomping at the bit to look after you
in the year ahead. (Just bring your
shades.)
Dominic Wilkinson Hon Sec - by Rick
Dom's greatest aspiration is to be
a graphic designer. Doubtless you
will see some of his handiwork on
Union publicity throughout the
year.
Dominic can usually be found in
the company of a black three-piece-
suite near the entrance of the Union
Office. The three-piece-suite is
rarely used for its intended purpose
as most of the time it is piled high
with junk. This all adds to the
friendly atmosphere Dom tries to
cultivate in his office, which is
sometimes referred to as 'The Glory
Hole'! You may find yourself in
there if you wish to book a room
in the Union Building, so beware.
Your safest bet is to sit on the floor.
Dominic is a very sensitive young
man, so always be polite to him!
Jonty Beavan Felix Editor- By Dom
A Jonty Poem
He said I had to write something
explaining what he's like.
His girlfriend is called Emma
and he doesn't have a bike.
His hair is long and tousled,
his eyes are deep and set.
He spends his time in Felix,
have you guessed who it is yet?
He has a nose for stories,
is keen to know your views.
He'll stick them in his paper,
that is bumper packed with
news.
So in four lines of conclusion
about someone I don't know.
I'm sure he's rather lovely,
or he may just be a complete
bastard.
