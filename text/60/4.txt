LETTERS TO T H E EDITOR
Dear S i r ,
W r i t i n g as one with experience of the
d i f f i c u l t i e s of producing FELIX, I o f f e r you
my h e a r t i e s t c o n g r a t u l a t i o n s on the produc-
t i o n of the supplement to your l a s t i s s u e .
Many e d i t o r s before you have been f a c e d w i t h
the problem of important news a r r i v i n g j u s t
- a f t e r FELIX goes "to press, but none has
solved i t i n so determined a manner as your-
s e l f .
Apart from the maroon and s i l v e r appear- '
anoe of a few purple passages, the whole t h i n g
was, i n my opinion, e x c e l l e n t l y done, and w i l l
serve as a model of i n d u s t r y , o r g a n i s a t i o n and
journalism to those Editora,-unborn and un-
begot, who w i l l be faced with s i m i l a r problems
i n years to come.
yours s i n o e r e l y ,

Dear S i r ,
Do you r e a l l y t h i n k t h a t 20 Guildsmen
could s u c c e s s f u l l y a t t a c k a p a r t y of 200 R.C.S?
Do you r e a l l y t h i n k that a dozen or more
p a i r s of R.C.S. t r o u s e r s were seen hanging i n
Hyde Park?
Do you r e a l l y t h i n k t h a t the R.C.S. men would
* throw a Guildsman over the Serpentine bridge on to
the ice?
May I suggest, a i r , that you remove the oat
from the f r o n t page of FELIX and s u b s t i t u t e a
spanner? ' j
Y o u r s f a i t h f u l l y ,

S i r ,
We f e e l that the misstatement of f a c t given
i n the l a s t i s s u e of F e l i x must not go unques-
t i o n e d . We would l i k e to p o i n t out to you - to
save any f u r t h e r unnecessary misunderstanding -
that, of the nine R.C.S. men concerned i n "pinch-
ing the spanner" only ONE - repeat ONE - accepts
the " h o s p i t a l i t y of the G u i l d s l e c t u r e courses".
Two f u r t h e r of these, admittedly, were w a i t i n g on
b i c y c l e s on the opposite side of the road from
G u i l d s .
We f e e l that the ONE who was "unsuspected" was
o f f s e t i n advantage by the f a c t that two R.C.S.
t i e s were worn and t n a t an R.C.S. union o f f i c i a l
was a l s o present.
Furthermore, the necessary i n f o r m a t i o n which
formed tne b a s i s of the r a i d was obtained l a s t
session, by a c c i d e n t , by two people who were not
i n G u i l d s by i n v i t a t i o n .
We remain, e t c ,

Dear S i r ,
Much abuse has been poured, by the C o l l e g e i n
g e n e r a l , and F e l i x i n p a r t i c u l a r on the heads of
the poor s p i n e l e s s c r e a t u r e s of G u i l d s who stood
by and watched the " d a s t a r d l y deed" committed.
No doubt t h i s conjures up a p i c t u r e of
s c r u f f y l i t t l e brown-baggers, t h e i r s p o r t s c o a t s
slashed w i t h yellow, s t a n d i n g p a r a l y s e d w i t h
f r i g h t while th,e g a l l a n t J a s p e r v a i n l y defended
our honour singlehanded a g a i n s t R.C.S. horda.
N a t u r a l l y t h i s scene l e a d s people to q u e s t i o n
the e f f e c t i v e n e s s of the c o l l e g e s e l e c t i o n board.
I am, however, one of the abused and I take
t h i s o p p o r t u n i t y t o p r e s e n t the f a c t s of the matter
the f i r s t , I am l e d t o b e l i e v e , t h a t you have
r e c e i v e d .
A few members of the C o l l e g e and f i v e or s i x
R.C.S. i n f i l t r a t o r s were v i e w i n g the n o t i c e -
boards i n the G u i l d s entrance h a l l when the bearer
of the Spanner appeared. He was Immediately s e t
upon and surrounded by the R.C.S. and by the time
the n o i s e a t t r a c t e d a t t e n t i o n tne Spanner was no
l o n g e r v i s i b l e . Tne v i c t i m was h u s t l e d out of
the door i n a matter of f i f t e e n seconds, and con-
t r a r y to common r e p o r t , tne only c r y u t t e r e d was
"Help l" - a s the v i c t i m went tnrough tha door.
N e i t h e r G u i l d a nor the Spanner were mentioned.
There was, i n f a c t , n o t h i n g to prevent the
c u r i o u s s p e c t a t o r from assuming t n a t an i n t r u d e r
from another C o l l e g e was being e v i c t e d .
The moral of t h i s i n c i d e n t i s that i f one
sees anything unusual t a k i n g plaoe one should
immediately i n v e s t i g a t e as there i s no t e l l i n g what
R.C.S. ( f a l s e t t o ) w i l l get up to next.

I should l i k e to draw the a t t e n t i o n o f your
r e a d e r s to the S c o t t i s h Country Dancing c l a s s e s
which are held on a l t e r n a t e F r i d a y s , i n the New

Increased s u p p o r t from I.C. members o f both
sexes would be very welcome - the shortage o f men
being p a r t i c u l a r l y s e r i o u s .
Previous experience i s not e s s e n t i a l , the
main object of the c l a s s e s being to provide an
evening's entertainment, without a s p i r i n g to per-

I might point out that there i s no s u b s c r i p -

Dear S i r ,
May I use your columns to express my d i s -
appointment at the q u a l i t y of the lunch hour
l e c t u r e s ?
T h i s e x c e l l e n t i d e a o f h o l d i n g these General
S t u d i e s l e c t u r e s i s being undermined by t h e i r poor
d e l i v e r y ; f o r while the l e c t u r e r s are undoubtedly
experts i n t h e i r own f i e l d s , t h e i r a b i l i t y to
d e l i v e r an i n t e r e s t i n g l e c t u r e i n the time a v a i l -
able i s l i m i t e d .
In order to use the time to the best advan-
tage, could not the r i d i c u l o u s dual-chairman
system be abolished - i f i t i s d e s i r e d to give a
few students experience i n i n t r o d u c i n g speakers,
then I am sure that any student s e l e c t e d f o r the
t a l k would be quite able to say the required words
of i n t r o d u c t i o n and thanks without the n e c e s s i t y
of being chaperoned by a c o l l e g e lecturer.. Then
by- making the i n t r o d u c t i o n a t a few minutes to
1-30 the l e c t u r e r could be given a f u l l 55 minutes
to 2-25, when the vote of/ thanks could be b r i e f
and to the p o i n t - or even e n t i r e l y absent, as the
spontaneous applause of the audience i s f a r b e t t e r
thanks than any formal set of words. At a recent
l e c t u r e , by the t i m e the v i B i t o r was allowed to
speak i t was l-35» and they were cut s h o r t at 2-20
to a l l o w two v o t e s o f thanks - the 10 minutes thua
was wasted d e p r i v i n g the audience of a short f i l m
and preventing the l e c t u r e r f r o m rounding o f f the
t a l k . The p r a c t i c e of a l l o w i n g 15 minutes f o r
questions at the end of a l e c t u r e b a r e l y twice
that long i s a w a s t e of time - those able to ask
questions probably have h a d 3ome previous acquain-
tance w i t h t h e subject, while those with no p r i o r
knowledge would not have h e a r d enough i n h a l f an
hour f o r them to be a b l e to frame an i n t e l l i g e n t
question. F i n a l l y , i t would probably h e l p '
s e v e r a l of the l e c t u r e r s i f they were g i v e n the
opportunity of spreading t h e i r l e c t u r e by g i v i n g
them two periods i n one week.

Dear S i r , - .
With r e s p e c t t o the b r i e f d i s c u s s i o n on grants
i n the l a s t Union meeting, we would l i k e to make
the f o l l o w i n g p o i n t s d e a r .
1) The Government when f i r i n g the present
State S c h o l a r s h i p r a t e s made i t q u i t e c l e a r t h a t
t h i a l e v e l was c o n s i d e r e d the b a s i c minimum amount
f r e q u i r e d f o r the students' s e l f s u f f i c i e n c y .
2) The Government recommended the L.E.A's to
pay grants at t h i s 'State' l e v e l . The m a j o r i t y
of L.E.A's have r e f u s e d t o do t h i s .
3) By the Government's own c o s t of l i v i n g
index, the cost of l i v i n g has r i s e n 26)1 s i n c e then.
4) I n 1947 the Government s a i d t h a t the m i n i -
mum number of students t h i s country needed to
MAINTAIN i t s present academic s t a n d i n g was 100,000
W 1950. The number of studenta at p r e s e n t i s
l e s s than 75»000 - a d e f i c i e n c y due i n g r e a t p a r t
to these i n s u f f i c i e n t g r a n t s .
We t h e r e f o r e f e e l t h a t the Union C o u n c i l i a
p u r s u i n g a b l i n d p o l i c y i n suggesting t h a t a l l i t a
a c t i o n s should be concerned only with c a s e s of i n -
d i v i d u a l h a r d s h i p . I t should as f a r as p o s s i b l e
l e a d a campaign on a N a t i o n a l L e v e l f o r h i g h e r
g r a n t s , t h i s b e i n g i n both the students' and the
n a t i o n a l i n t e r e s t s , as i s recognised a l r e a d y by the
Government.
