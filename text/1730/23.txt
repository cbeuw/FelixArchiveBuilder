I
t’s been a while
since Celeste Ng’s
best-selling novels
have been sitting
on my shelf, but I have
never ﬁgured out the right
moment to read it - these
are stories I knew I would
love, the kind that I would
want to read on a Sunday
afternoon, with a cup of
chamomile tea and a ﬁne
plate of vanilla short-
bread. But out of the blue,
I simply picked up Little
Fires Everywhere and
little did I know it would
lead to devour the entire
novel in one sitting.
Right off the bat, I
recognized the classic
Celeste Ng’s writing
style, opening the story
with a startling ﬁre where
the Richardsons’ house
has been burned by
their youngest daughter
Izzy, with little ﬁres
everywhere. Ng always
manages to ask a bizarrely
fascinating question that
lures the readers in, eager
to ﬂip through hundreds
of pages simply for an
answer.
Little Fires Everywhere
is set in the late nineties
in Shaker Heights, Ohio,
progressively planned
with social expectations
taken to the extreme. The
Richardsons are a prime
example of such a family
- everything is in perfect
order. Mr. Richardson
and Mrs. Richardson
have perfect jobs, three
children, and a comfort-
able house. Enter Mia
Warren and her daughter
Pearl who breaks seem-
ingly every unspoken
rule this neighborhood
abides by. Mia, a gifted
photographer and a single
mother, never settles
down and is always on the
move. An unstable job, an
incomplete family, and
a carefree lifestyle - the
Warrens’ arrival tips the
balance that the commu-
nity has tried to maintain.
The two families clash
when a Shaker Heights
family attempts to adopt
a Chinese baby and take
a heavy toll on both the
Warrens and the Richard-
sons.
It wasn’t until the end

its readers to unexpected
places. If her vision for
this novel was to deliver
a powerful story, she has
executed it ﬂawlessly.
The summary does little
justice to the engrossing,
emotional tale. It’s best
to dive into a story as
such knowing as little as
possible. Ng has posed
difﬁcult questions that
remain unanswered to this
date, but the ending does
give way to her answers
on embracing chaos,
motherhood, and altruism.
alone.
of the story that I realised
it has explored all dimen-
sions of motherhood, from
surrogacy to abortion
to adoption. It asks the
difﬁcult questions of what
it means to a mother,
and whether a mother
has the right to her child.
The unending debates
between biological and
adoptive parents are again
exempliﬁed in the story
with layers of depth, with
themes of justice, honesty,
and privileges entwined
perfectly.
Celeste Ng has crafted
captivating characters
where I could not help but
feel deeply invested in,
each with his or her own
unique twist and ﬂare de-
serving of a novel devoted
to her alone. There almost
isn’t an antagonist, as
every character’s vulnera-
ble side evokes empathy,
the darker side kindles the
rage. The slow-paced plot
added a layer of depth;
It’s still a page-turner,
more often than not taking
