How Eliud Kipchoge ran a sub-2h marathon
S
ub-2 has hap-
pened, and it
still hasn’t sunk
in completely.
Yes, the conditions were
VERY optimised and
it is not record eligible,
and we’ll get to that
later, but the enormity of
such an effort is almost
unbelievable. Prior to this
time last year, only one
man had run under 2:03
in a record-eligible city
marathon, and he (Dennis
Kimetto) has since transi-
tioned into insignificance
as if trying to avoid
something. Enter Eliud
Kipchoge. This man has
won 11 out of the 12 ex-
tremely competitive city
marathons he has started,
including four London
Marathons (essentially
the running equivalent of
Wimbledon Tennis - it is
reputationally and finan-
cially the top prize in the
sport). Even Kipchoge
could not break 2:03 until
2017. And in the space
of just a couple of years,
over 3 minutes has been
wiped off what people
believe is achievable in a
marathon distance event.
That is equivalent to Bolt
running 9.32 seconds for
100 metres, or Hicham El
Guerrouj running an un-
thinkable 3:20 for 1500m.
So, what are these
specialconditions?Firstly,
you have the pacing,
which was provided by 41
rotating pacemakers and
a car mounted green laser
indicating 2-hour pace.
While in cycling, one can
expect to save around
a third in power output
by ‘drafting’ and taking
advantage of aerodynamic
blockage, this effect is
much smaller at running
pace because of the cubic
effect of speed on power.
It is likely that the majority
of the benefit of drafting
comes from the psycho-
logical benefit of not
having to pace every step,
but rather deferring that
task to another. Secondly,
the date, time and course
were all selected to
optimise the suitability
of the event for marathon
running. Kipchoge had
perfect weather, no hills
(6 metres gained overall)
and only 8 sweeping
turns. Add to this that he
had bottles handed to him,
and Kipchoge had the
perfect conditions to crush
an optimal marathon. But
still, to my mind, this does
not explain this feat.
The third and final
factor, sadly, is the shoes.
Sadly because Nike does
have, and has had for quite
some time, a monopoly on
shoes that almost certain-
ly aid marathon running.
The first piece of evidence
for this is a NYT article
that used 500,000 runners’
Strava data to show a 4%
benefit from switching
to Nike Vaporfly 4%
shoes. Secondly, Kipcho-
ge’s (and other notable
Nike athletes’) recent
improvement in times.
Thirdly, on the day I write
this, Brigid Kosgei has
OBLITERATED Paula
Radcliffe’s ‘unbreakable’
2:15:25 that has stood
for 16 years by running a
stupendous 2:14:04. Who
was she sponsored by?
Guess. And on that rather
sour tasting note, I’ll end.

of the season saw
ICURFC 3rd XV
take on SOAS 1st
XV at Harlington.
Under favourable
conditions the opening
exchanges were domi-
nated by Imperial. The
sustained pressure yielded
an early try, finished with
a brilliant solo effort
from Sam Hirons inside
the opposition 22. A well
kicked conversion gave
the hosts an early 7-0 lead.
The game became a lot
cagier for the rest of the
half as errors from both
sides slowed play down,
preventing Imperial from
extending their lead.
Sam Hirons doubled
his tally in the second
half, making the most of
the referee’s advantage
by breaking through a
series of SOAS last ditch
tackles to touch down. A
second conversion further
extended the lead to 14-0.
Imperial’s lack of
discipline, particularly at
the breakdown, allowed
SOAS back into the game
as they scored twice. In
one case, Imperial failed
to ground the ball within
their own in-goal-area
following a long kick over
the top. Handing an easy
score to the opposition.
This brought the score to
14-12 which set up a very
scrappy finish in which
Imperial showed a huge
defensive effort in the
face of late pressure.
The final minutes
saw Matt Takle shown a
yellow card for persistent
off-side as Imperial
looked to close out the
game. Shortly after, the
whistle blew seeing the
2019/2020 campaign get
off to a winning start. IC Rugby // IC Rugby
