his year’s Nobel
prize in Physics
was awarded
half to James
Peebles (Princeton
University) for work in
physical cosmology and
the other half jointly to
Michel Mayor and Didier
Queloz for the discovery
of an exoplanet orbiting a
solar-type star. Both have
played an essential role in
our understanding of the
cosmos and Earth’s place
in the universe.
Peebles has set the
foundation for modern
cosmology and developed
theoretical tools that were
used to discover new
physics and were used to
shed light on the history
of the universe as well
as its composition. By
exploring fundamental
properties of the universe
and studying the radiation
that was released immedi-
ately after the Big Bang,
our planet. While at the
University of Geneva,
Michel Mayor and his
collaborators designed
the ELODIE echelle
spectrograph, a new piece
of equipment that would
allow them to study more
than just the brightest
stars, those closest to our
solar system, and expand
their observational capa-
bilities. Using Doppler
spectroscopy, they iden-
tiﬁed a planet that had
the size of Jupiter but,
surprisingly, was located
much closer to the star – a
distance ten times less
than that between Jupiter
and the Sun. This and the
very short ornital period
of a planet with the mass
of Jupiter were some of
the reasons that their dis-
covery was met with skep-
ticism. However, because
of short orbital period
of 4 days, it was possible
for other researchers to
very quickly verify and
validate their discovery.
This was the starting point
of a new ﬁeld of astro-
physics, namely the study
of exoplanets and planet
formation.

Science editor Sânziana Foia gives an overview of the research behind this year’s science Nobel Prizes.
Peebles’ has constructed
a model that allows us
to describe the Universe
from its ﬁrst moment and
up into the distant future.
Moreover, Peebles’ work
was a cornerstone in
establishing the composi-
tion of the universe – of
which only 5% is ordinary
matter and the rest is com-
prised of dark matter and
dark energy!
Back in 1995, Mayor
and Queloz discovered
a gaseous planet 150
times the size of Earth,
the ﬁrst to be identiﬁed
outside our solar system,
50 light years away from

from mobile
phones to elec-
tric vehicles and laptops,
little thought is often given
to what keeps powering
the world we live in –
lithium ion batteries. The
Nobel Prize in Chemistry
2019 rewarded John B.
Goodenough (University
of Texas, USA), M.
Stanley Whittingham
(Binghamton University,
USA) and Akira Yoshino
(Meijo University, Japan)
for the development of an
essential tool that gave
rise to a “rechargeable
world”.
During the oil crisis in
the 1970s, Stanley Whit-
tingham started exploring
methods that could elim-
inate the need of fossil
fuel energy in technology.
When researching super-
conductors, he discovered
titanium disulphide
– a highly energy rich
material which can ac-
commodate lithium ions
in its molecular architec-
ture. Using this for the
cathode of the battery and
metallic lithium for the
anode (which has a strong
drive to release electrons)
lead to a battery that was
so powerful it was too
explosive to be used in
any applications.
John Goodenough take
the discovery further
and both increased its
potential and its safety
by exchanging the metal
sulphide with a metal
oxide – it was cobalt
oxide intercalated with
lithium ions that he found
could produce as much
as four volts. Using this
as a starting point, Akira
Yoshino was the ﬁrst to
create the ﬁrst commer-
cially viable lithium ion
battery in 1985. To further
increase their safety,
he switched the anode
material from lithium to
petroleum coke, a carbon
material.
The end product of this
year’s Nobel laureates’
research was a light-
weight, portable battery
which have changed
the technological world
as soon as they entered
market in 1991, having
laid the foundation for
a wireless, rechargeable
society.
