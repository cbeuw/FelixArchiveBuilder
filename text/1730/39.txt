Hamburg is
the second
largest city
in Germany after Berlin,
it still lags behind the
capital and Munich when
in comes to the number
of foreign visitors,
particularly those who
are seeking cultural and
historical values that the
aforementioned cities
offer abundantly.
However, these
numbers have seen a
steady rise in the past few
years as more people are
discovering the charms
of this delightful city.
Hamburg is also home
to the fallen giants,
Hamburger SV, the only
houses the largest model
railway system in the
world!
Among the many
European towns and
natural landscapes on
display, the Italy section
will definitely catch some
attention. Inspired by
regions such as South
Italy with the Amalfi
coast, South Tyrol, Rome,
Tuscany, and Liguria, this
190 m² of “la dolce vita”
model boasts crystal clear
‘water’ with beautiful
buildings at the sides of
the cliffs, as well as some
notable monuments in
Rome such as St Peter’s
Basilica and the Colosse-
um.
As you walk along the
mini towns of Europe, you
will surely come across
the massive Knuffigen
airport that spans over
an area of 150 m² and is
arguably the highlight of
the attraction. The airport
model comes equipped
with humongous airport
terminals, with various
passenger figurines inside
them, the airplane hangar,
and even take-off and
arrival runways for the
departing and arriving
planes. To add to the
excitement, there is even
a schedule of planes that
are arriving or departing,
with their own unique
flight designator (just like
in a real airport!) so you
can catch your favourite
miniature airlines in
action.
Miniatur Wunderland
doesn’t just offer small-
scaled models of towns
and cities, but it also
sneaked in plenty of
Easter eggs and surprises
for the keen-eyed tourists,
as well as special events
that happen ever so often
in the model towns such
as fire trucks rushing to
a nearby fire breakout or
a bunch of mini figures
performing a score from a
model of Hamburg’s own
renowned Elbphilharmo-
nie (Elbe Philharmonic
Hall)Itprovidesmorethan
just the typical adorable
mini towns that can be
found in other places in
the world and with 15€
(~£13) per admission, it
will be worth both your
money and time.

competed in the highest
tier of the German football
league since its inception,
until they succumbed
and were relegated to the
second tier just last year.
Meanwhile, tucked
away between the mean-
dering canals of Hamburg,
along the historic ware-
house district of Speicher-
stadt, lies the most popular
destination for local and
foreign visitors alike, the
Miniatur Wunderland.
This attraction houses
thousands of miniature
figures such as beautiful
European towns and the
vast desert landscape of the
USA with its eye-catching
mini Las Vegas as the
pivotal piece of the model.
The attraction spreads over
three floors in a former
warehouse in the docks
area of the city and among
its miniature towns, it also
