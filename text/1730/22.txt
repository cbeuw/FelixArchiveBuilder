“There is some
optimism in
the form of
the faith of
goodness in
human nature”
H
ello, Felix
R e a d e r !
My name is
Matthew and
I will be one of your
three film editors for the
coming year. I am first
year student, so still new
to the university and
I’m really enjoying it so
far. My degree course
is Physics with a Year
Abroad, hoping to study
somewhere in France
(where there’s an espe-
cially good cinema scene)
or Switzerland in my third
year.
Film is an eclectic
form of artistic and
existential expression.
It is distinguished from
similar media such as
musical theatre by its
uniquely universal appeal
and influence on popular
culture. I have no particu-
lar requirements when it
comes to the silver screen:
I think that one can almost
always tell a good picture
when one sees it based
on a variety of factors,
such as cinematography,
pacing, storyline and
general atmosphere.
Certainly, I am partial to a
few blockbusters and I do
not support the view that
these are necessarily of a
lower calibre. The follow-
ing are a selection of my
favourite films which you
definitely watch.
Unforgiven
This unconven-
tional early ‘90’s West-
ern may have featured
and been directed by
Clint Eastwood, but it
is markedly different in
style and tone from the
Spaghetti Westerns of
the 1960’s directed by
Sergio Leone. The film
focuses less on the action,
complex storylines and
the general glamorisa-
tion of outlaw life in the
Wild West. Unforgiven
explores the darker side
of ‘cowboy’ culture. Its
pacing is slow; depictions
of violence are drawn-
out and brutally realistic;
the mood of the film is
sombre and heavy. In
a departure from East-
wood’s much-played
role as a dashing young
gunslinger, he plays an
ageing, widowed bandit
repentant of his younger
days. Accompanied by
Morgan Freeman as his
equally grizzled former
partner, Gene Hackman
as savagely sadistic
sheriff ironically named
‘Little Bill’ and Richard
Harris as the arrogant,
UK-born gunfighter
‘English Bob’, it is hardly
surprising it won Oscars
for Best Picture, Director
and Supporting Actor
(Gene Hackman). Watch
for its masterful acting,
compelling storyline and
thoughtful take on the
human condition in the
Wild West.
2001: A Space
Odyssey
It would be hard to
have a list of favourite
pictures without one
directed by the indelible
Stanley Kubrick, widely
considered to be one of, if
not the, greatest filmmak-
ers of all time. For me,
by Guillermo del Toro
has been described by
the man himself as the
spiritual prequel to his
later magnum opus, Pan’s
Labyrinth. The film pos-
sesses some of the typical
traits of a del Toro pro-
duction, such as an imag-
inative, child-led narra-
tive, a backdrop featuring
war and aspects of the
supernatural playing key
roles. Overall, however,
this eerie, pared-down,
(relatively) low-budget
ghost story has a distinct-
ly different atmosphere
to his larger, well-estab-
lished blockbusters. I en-
joyed watching this film
for its balance of gothic
horror and underlying
sadness, well-handled by
del Toro through the hazy,
half-understanding eyes
of a child. Only available
in Spanish with subtitles,
it is worth seeing as an
unconventional ghost tale
less interested in obvious
thrills.
The Godfather
Considered by many to
thegreatestfilmofalltime,
I love this picture from
Coppola for its brilliant
combination of a highly
atmospheric soundtrack,
effective acting and the
richness of its set pieces,
narratives and character
profiles. The three-hour
long piece of cinema takes
the viewer through every
dimension: it has action,
meandering, panoramic
frames, crime and cor-
ruption, tension, drama,
death, resolution – yet it
never feels overdone or
badly paced.The character
arcs are satisfying, and the
story gives a fascinating
insight into the world of
organised crime in 1940s
USA, as well as inspiring
reflection on the empti-
ness of violence and cap-
turing the state of big-city
culture at the time. Then
there’s the Marlon Brando
impressions. A highly en-
tertaining, essential film.
La Haine
This 1995 black-and-
white French picture is
unlikely to be something
most readers have seen
but gives a sobering
glimpse into the menacing
undertones of ‘90s French
society. It is a piece of
realist cinema, shot almost
like a documentary, fol-
lowing an instrumental
20 hours in the lives of
three recalcitrant, down-
trodden French youths
from immigrant families
living in the impoverished
banlieue of France. It is an
important, if not depress-
ing, work looking at the
standoff between police
and violent, disillusioned
members of the poorer,
minority areas of France.
Disparity between them
and the rest of France
and the ensuing hostility
is examined, both in
terms of wealth and per-
ceived social class. The
characters in this film,
designed to resemble
many members of the
French public, are shown
to often lead completely
aimless lives, born in
harsh surroundings,
within an unknown wider
world where no-one
seems to care about their
struggles and continued
failure seems inevitable,
removing any notion of
motivation and purpose.
There is some optimism
in the form of the faith in
the goodness of human
nature; a moment when
one of the characters
is driven to commit a
terrible crime but does
not. The opening line of
this feature, however, ‘it’s
about a society in freefall’
remains a beautifully
tragic summary of its
main theme. Unfortunate-
ly, only the story is a work
of fiction.

“It would be
hard to have
a list without
Kubrick”
although a slightly clichéd
pick, Space Odyssey is his
masterwork. Aside from
its standalone excellence,
Kubrick introduces many
original ideas in this work
which have since gone on
to revolutionise the Sci-Fi
genre which I particularly
enjoyed. These include
the stark contrast between
scenes with sweeping
classical scores such as the
iconic opening (Strauss’
Also Sprach Zarathustra)
and scenes filled only by
silence or ambient noise,
as well the notion of AI
overtaking mankind.
The plot and themes are
complex and fascinating
– this is a film to watch
twice. It is a must-see for
its tense, meticulously
crafted scenes, enthralling
(if not unusual) cine-
matography and a greater
understanding of Sci-Fi
pictures in general.
