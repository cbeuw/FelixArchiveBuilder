Tick, tick… BOOM!

efore there was
Rent, there was
30/90. Wait
a second. Let
me start again. Before
there was Rent there was
Boho Days, a… solo rock
monologue? Ah, here
we go. Before there was
Rent, there was 30/90,
which was renamed to
Boho Days and finally
to tick, tick… BOOM!,
an autobiographical solo
rock monologue created
and performed by the late
Jonathan Larson and then
posthumously reworked
into a three-actor stage
musical. Convoluted
history aside, tick, tick…
BOOM!hasbeenreceiving
a lot of attention of late, a
surprise given its relative
obscurity. In fact, Netflix
has recently announced its
own adaptation of the mu-
sical with none other than
Hamlet extraordinaire,
Lin-Manuel Miranda, set
to direct.
From the moment the
lights dim and the story
begins, it is easy to under-
stand why a musical set
in the 1990s still strikes a
chord with the audience of
today. Over a background
of incessant clockwork
ticking, the main char-
acter, Jon (Alex Lodge)
introduces himself and
explains that the sound
we hear is the sound of
his mounting anxiety.
a steady countdown to
an inevitable explosion.
Immediately, I recognise
the image before me: a
young man shaking with
nervous energy, eyes
darting around looking
for some semblance of
security, desperate for a
change or a big break.
Forget the 1980s – this is
peak millennial anxiety.
And then Lodge breaks
into the opening number,
the ex-titular 30/90, and if
anything could qualify as
a BOOM!, this was it. At-
tacking the fricative con-
range to the emotional
highs and lows of his
character, spinning his
honeyed tones from cocky
and braggadocious in the
comedy duet No More to
heartrending and soulful
in the mournful Real
Life. I find his character
and performance more
convincing than our often
self-involved protagonist.
Perhaps it’s because
Michael never breaks the
fourth wall and speak to
the audience like Jon can,
the emotional distance
adding a layer of vulnera-
bility to his character.
IfLodgeisthedominant
and distinctive heart notes,
and Hume the rich base
notes, Georgie Ashford’s
Susan rounds off the trio
with her lofty top notes
that contrast pleasantly
against the men. A shame
then that her character is
so underutilised. In fact,
the biggest issue I have
with this musical is the
way all the women are
presented. Susan, Jon’s
girlfriend, dreams of
moving to the seaside
(why are all women in
musicals obsessed with
settling down at the
seaside?) and getting out
of the rat race that Jon has
trapped them in with his
inability to compromise
or see beyond his own
ambitions. And yet the
story almost villainises
her for not believing in
Jon’s vision or sticking it
out until he becomes suc-
cessful. Unfortunately, all
the female characters are
either obstacles to Jon’s
success or an accessory
to his ego. For example,
the second number
Green Green Dress is a
song purely about how
attractive Susan looks in
a green dress. Although
a fun number, it does
nothing for the plot and
tells us nothing new
about the characters aside
from Jon’s functioning
sex drive. It’s basically a
gratuitous sex scene in the
form of a song. That’s bad
enough on its own, but a
closer look at the lyrics
might even make you
start to wonder about the
consent of it all.
And that’s kind of the
problem with the whole
musical. Even though
there are great moments
of introspection and per-
tinent messages that ring
true regardless of the time
period, there is nothing
remarkable or original
about the story. It’s a tale
as old as time: the ar-
chetypal suffering artist,
pressured by those around
him (and it’s always a
him) to conform and give
up on his dreams, is saved
at the last minute by some
lucky twist of fate. Only
this time, the story is told
by really quite unreasona-
bly talented actors and, oh
yeah, they also sing a song
about Twinkies. As Jon
remarks near the begin-
ning, it’s “hard for people
born after 1960 to be ide-
alistic or original”. How
true he was! Although he
was probably hoping to
be an exception, not an
example.
A musical worth the generous punctuation?
