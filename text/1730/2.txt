Faces Old and New
eing at universi-
ty is, naturally,
a transitional
period. We
learn, we change – all of
us do, and a hell of a lot
at that.
It's the first time most
of us have been away
from home. This means
different things for differ-
ent people.
For some it’s the chance
to get away from pressures
at home: the pressure to
succeed, perhaps, or the
pressure to adhere to a set
of beliefs you don’t actu-
ally subscribe to (for me,
this took the form of real-
ising I don’t actually care
about politics as much as
I bloody should, which is
near-blasphemous in my
debate-heavy household).
For some it’s the freedom
to lie-in, stay up late, skip
the occasional lecture
(bless Panopto, bless), or
stop trying and failing to
hide the fact that you ‘so-
cially smoke’. For some
it’s the chance to reinvent
themselves (successfully
or otherwise, cringily
or otherwise) – to get
away from a world where
everybody remembers
that time you called the
teacher ‘mum’ instead of
‘Miss’ and be cool, or be
more outgoing, or even
to be more sensible and
disciplined than you were
before.
As we go through our
degrees, the transitions
remain in volume but
change in tone. They stop
being about grand ges-
tures and becomes more
about gradual understand-
ing and self-introspection.
It becomes a process of
coming to terms with
whoever it is you ended
up becoming after those
big shifts in lifestyle and
circumstance – someone
that can sometimes feel
like a stranger in the
mirror. You stop forcing
the changes, stop experi-
menting with new things
so much, and instead settle
down a little and start to
figure out what you like
and don’t like about this
new world you’re in.
You figure out what it all
means, man.
It’s an incremental
thing, understanding
yourself. Nobody wakes
up on the day they turn 18
or 21 and feels any differ-
ent than the day before –
something I found myself
a little disappointed about,
despite the obvious logic
behind it. But I realised
that I was a little more
comfortable with myself
than I had been a year
before – or, if not com-
fortable, then at least less
bewildered and somewhat
more purposeful or direct-
ed in my evaluations of
my own life.
Of course, this process
immediately repeats itself
upon graduation – sud-
denly, we’re free. Sweet
freedom, the world is our
oyster, and so on and so
forth. It’s another new
world opening up before
us. For some that’s scary,
while for others it’s exhil-
arating. Usually a little of
both, if we are honest with
ourselves.
One aspect of that Final
TransitionTM is losing
some of our friends. That’s
something I wanted to talk
about, this issue, writing
on the night of graduation.
Felix has been fortu-
nate for the last few years
to have an incredibly
fun and highly dedicated
team. I’ve talked about
this a little in previous ed-
itorials. This is a group of
people who inspired me to
take up the legacy of the
Editor-in-Chief position,
and who I broadly look up
to for various reasons.
Tonight, some of our
alumni came back. A few
are still kicking about Im-
perial – for some insane
reason they decided to
do PhDs here, the poor
blighters – but most have
departed for pastures
new. From random con-
versation this evening, I
know that one has gone
to the Netherlands, one
to Canada, and another
to Poland, while the rest
have scattered elsewhere
like dandelion puffs in the
wind.
Graduation is a special
moment, months after
departure, when for one
night the last few years
crystallise into a clear-cut
version of themselves.
It is a glass night; easily
shattered, fragile and
temporary, but beautifully
refracting the light of time
well spent (and time ill
spent) over the unique
experience that is univer-
sity. Friends of years are
seen for the last time in a
long while, and memories
and in-jokes doomed to
be forgotten are shared
one last time – usually
over several pints, which
might partially explain the
‘forgetting’ part.
I don’t think that’s
necessarily how most
people celebrating this
evening feel about it – but
that’s how it appears from
the outside, observing
as (Felix) cats tend to
do. It’s easy to see the
connections forged
during late-night shifts
in the office churning out
horoscopes for Hangman
(or, towards the end of
the year, Master’s degree
theses.) I’m sure that
every group of laughing
ex-students at the Union
have equivalent memories
and experiences – each of
them slowly fossilising
in amber as an imperfect
image of good times as
the evening wears on.
But you know – the
really wonderful thing was
how they said hello and
joked, after popping into
the office for a moment,
with the new members of
the team working with me
on this week’s issue.
This meandering edi-
torial is a last huzzah for
them – the Felix alumni,
gone but not forgotten,
and welcome to resurrect
in the Felissy office any
time. May many a Colin
cake lie in your future.
(This is also a great way
to see if they still bother to
read the paper – especially
those doing PhDs here.)

commonly known,
