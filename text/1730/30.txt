The Form Factor of Modern Smartphones
Revolutionary Shifts in Modern Smartphone Design

“The
functionality
and ease-of-
use of phones
have grown
exponentially”
S
martphones, and
mobile phones in
general, are noth-
ing but merely an
extension of the human
mind; to put it simply,
these devices serve as
external information
banks and keep us con-
nected with the outside
world. Always adapting
and evolving to meet the
needs of the consumer,
the form-factor (i.e. the
design) of these devices
have seen numerous var-
iations and changes over
the past three decades.
From the brick to ﬂip-
phones, early day mobile
handsets serve as the an-
cestors of the modern-day
smartphone. Their past
plays a big role in where
their future is headed.
Despite being nearly
thirty years apart, these
devices share a common
purpose: to serve its user
as a basic communication
device. To be fair, neither
of these devices, albeit
modern or retro, fall short
on that end.
Modern smartphones
take it a step further, with
video call, internet voice
call, instant messaging,
social media, video
streaming, etc. The reason
why today’s phones have
a much more multi-pur-
pose nature is because
they’re very personal
devices. Nobody would
variety. The design of the
phone acted as identiﬁers
of the company they rep-
resented; each phone pos-
sessed unique quirks and
features that signaled the
brand. An iconic example
is a standard Blackberry
handset. Immediately
recognizable, this device
stood out from the rest
with its square-shaped,
palm-sized design with a
full-size physical keypad.
Companies saw selling
phones to consumers as
a great proﬁt-making
opportunity and started
pushing out phones at
a rate higher than the
demand. It was inevitable
that mobile handsets were
the most effective way
to stay connected with
others, and soon enough,
widespread adoption on
a global scale took place.
In effect, it was a matter
of competition between
smartphone vendors
to produce phones that
attracted consumers. With
this trend came handsets
that lacked the ease-of-
use factor and had way
too many unnecessary
features; to put it simply,
they weren’t centered
around the user. Rather,
these devices were aimed
at increasing their brand’s
share of the market and
the proﬁts that came with
it.
Ever remember the day
when you had to press a
key multiple times for a
letter to show up? Well,
that’s exactly how it was
in retro mobile handsets
with the exception of
those that possessed a full
keypad. With physical
keypads and buttons,
these devices didn’t have
a large screen real estate.
As a matter of fact, their
physical footprint wasn’t
nearly as large as today’s
smartphones, well, with
the exception of the retro
brick cell phone.
Due to their minimum
functionality, the structure
tended to be more versa-
tile and thus came in many
forms, one of the most
iconic being the capability
to “ﬂip”. Composed of
two parts connected by
a hinge mechanism, this
design saw the phone
being split distinctly into
two parts: the keypad and
the display. This method
allowed for much larger
displays while maintain-
ing the same footprint
while folded, albeit a bit
thicker.
Again, keep in mind
that phones of this time
were mostly used for
calling, texting, e-mail,
memos, and playing very
simple games. Later, the
camera and music player
were integrated into the
phone. This critical step
essentially reduced the
need to carry two extra
devices.
Another key factor is
that almost all the software
on the phone was devel-
oped by the company that
produced it. There were
little to none third party
software programs and the
idea of an app store was
still a concept. In effect,
the past saw the usage of
“smartphones” in a much
primitive way.
Over the past two
decades, the functionality
and ease-of-use of phones
have grown exponen-
tially, thus making them
“smart”. This key attribute
also includes the nature of
the device to link up with
the internet. Third party
support has been more
than ever and the imple-
mentation of an app store
provides the device with
an ever-increasing set of
features to keep the user
engaged.
Today’s smartphone
line-up are based on
two primary platforms:
Android and iOS. In the
past, companies created
their own proprietary OSs
and frameworks. This is
primarily what lead to
the lack of third-party
support.
Now, imagine today’s
world except that each
brand had their own pro-
prietary OS, well, apart
from Apple. Also, keep in
mind that most third-party
support either comes from
small startups or the open
source community.
These groups don’t
have the time to adapt
their solutions to every
platform at the rate of
demand. In addition, this
mess only truly shows
itself when you com-
“Nobody
would want
to carry one
different
device for each
purpose”
want to carry one different
device for each purpose;
it just isn’t practical in a
fast moving world where
things have to be seam-
lessly connected.
Coming back to retro
phone design, it’s evident
that there was quite a large
