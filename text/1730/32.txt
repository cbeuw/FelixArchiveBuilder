T
etris. A game
we all know and
love. Some dub
it the ‘Perfect
Game’ and for good
reason. Created in 1984
in the USSR by Alexey
Pajitnov, it quickly took
the world by storm with its
addictive yet deceptively
simple gameplay. Selling
over 170 million copies to
date, the general concept
has remained the same:
one of seven tetrominoes
falls from the top of the
screen, you can rotate it in
any direction but once it
hits the ﬂoor it is stuck in
place. Do this repeatedly
with the aim of ﬁlling an
entire row… once you ﬁll
a row, that row is deleted.
Keep going until you mess
up and the whole screen is
ﬁlled to the top!
Relatively simple right?
Well, it is harder than you
might think, and with in-
creasing levels of speed as
the game goes on you will
ﬁnd that there is a huge
disparity between skilled
players and newbies. With
seemingly no limit to the
skill cap of this game,
many hardcore players
have turned to create a
competitive scene out of
the game.
CTWC
The Classic Tetris
World Championship
is hosted every year at
the Portland Gaming
Expo and is taking place
this weekend from the
18th – 20th October. The
competition launched in
2010 during the ﬁlming
“Even before
the first CTWC,
Jonas and
Harry were
rivals”
“...the
consistency
of Jonas over
the last decade
cannot be
pushed under
the rug”
the highest score you
possibly can. Harry and
Jonas were both going for
the max-out when it was
ﬁrst achieved, making the
2010 CTWC effectively
a grudge match between
the two. Jonas pulled off a
win in the ﬁnals, exacting
his revenge over Harry.
This dominance over
Harry would continue,
winning every following
CTWC until 2014. Master
Hong was on ﬁre this year,
easily taking a 3-1 victory
over Jonas and downing
the Titan. Unfortunately,
since 2014 Harry has not
seen anywhere near the
same level of success.
The Virtuoso
Other than 2014, Jonas
continued to see unpar-
alleled success in the
world of Tetris, achieving
multiple world records
in different categories
and consistently winning
major tournaments.
However, in early 2018
a young 16-year old boy
from California began
to rise to fame due to
his ability to play past
the level 29 kill-screen.
The way he does this is
by utilising a technique
called ‘hyper-tapping’.
Hyper-tapping is as it
sounds – tapping insanely
fast – by vibrating the
controller between your
thumb and the rest of your
hand. This means that you
can move the piece far
faster than the traditional
method of simply holding
down a direction and thus,
if your brain works fast
enough, you can continue
to play past level 29 and
beyond.To date, his record
is level 34, a completely
unprecedented realm that
no one else has even come
close to achieving. In the
same year that Joseph ﬁrst
appeared, he completely
shocked the Tetris world
by stealing the limelight
from Jonas and being
the 3rd ever CTWC
champion; his victory was
so dominant that Jonas
was unable to take a single
game from Joseph. Since
then Joseph has continued
the same spell of domi-
nance shown by Jonas in
years prior, taking world
record after world record
and innovating like no
other before him.
This Year
Unlike in previous
years, the outcome of this
World Championship is
truly unpredictable. Many
pros expect Joseph to take
back to back victories,
but the consistency of
Jonas over the last decade
cannot be pushed under
the rug – the man knows
how to deal with pressure
on the big stage. Other
prominent players are
in the running: Koryan,
a long-time player from
Japan who also utilises
hyper-tapping has been
getting closer and closer
to winning, reaching
4th place in both 2016
and 2018. Moreover,
meme-famous Jeff Moore
(TETRIS FOR JEFF)
who came in 2nd place in
2016 is making his return
this year. With a huge
line-up of highly regarded
players, who knows what
is going to happen?
If you are interested in
checking it out be sure to
watch the CTWC Twitch
channel this weekend to
ﬁnd out who’s going to
take home the beautiful
T-Block trophy!

of Ecstacy of Order: The
Tetris Masters (A great
documentary that I would
highly recommend) to
determine the ‘World’s
Greatest Tetris Player’.
To standardise the playing
ﬁeld, everybody plays on
the original NES version
of the game from 1989.
An old Nintendo World
Championship competitor
of Tetris, Trey Harrison,
created speciﬁc code so
that in 1v1 situations
both competitors would
receive the random se-
lection of blocks in the
same order to eliminate
the luck factor involved.
With these rules set in
place, it allows for a very
professional atmosphere
and unique playstyles to
shine, whether it be the
‘centre well’ antics of
Thor Aackerlund or the
extreme ‘hyper-tapping’
of last year’s champion
Joseph Saelee.
In the 9 years the
tournament has been
running, Jonas Neubauer
(the ﬁrst-ever champion)
has been the dominant
force. Winning 7 out of 9
and being in every ﬁnal,
he is without a doubt the
GOAT of Classic Tetris.
The history of the years he
did not win are extremely
interesting and pave the
way for understanding
why CTWC 2019 might
be the craziest year yet!
Harry vs. Jonas
Even before the ﬁrst
CTWC, Jonas and Harry
were rivals. In 2009, Harry
Hong became the ﬁrst
known player to achieve
the highest possible score,
999,999 dubbed a ‘max-
out’. The reason it is so
hard to achieve this score
is not only the extreme
skill required to stay alive
long enough, but also
the game reaches a ‘kill-
screen’ at level 29 where
the pieces fall too fast
to be able to play. This
means you are effectively
on a time limit to reach
