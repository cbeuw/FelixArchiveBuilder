store and Google services,
without which most com-
panies wouldn’t survive.
Anyways, going back
to the design of smart-
phones, it’s now clear that
the stagnation in variety
of design is primarily due
to software limitations.
However, companies are
now looking past this
limitation to push out
smartphones that make
their brand look unique
in the face of consumers.
The standard rectangular
glass and metal slab
design that started with
the original iPhone is
now slowly fading with
smartphone manufac-
turers taking inspiration
from past designs and
applying it to the modern
scenario. A more recent
example of this is the
Samsung Galaxy Fold
— A ﬂip-phone inspired
smartphone with a radical
modern twist.
With smartphones
looking more alike than
ever with all screen
displays, smartphone
vendors are pouring
money into innovation
to keep their brand name
from hanging on the
balance. In this process,
we consumers gain access
to devices that both meet
our needs as well as the
needs of the manufactur-
ers.
The “rectangular-slab”
design was so inﬂuential
that manufacturers found
it convenient to stick
with it and go on from
there with their variants.
However, the variables
(screen size, frame,
camera layout, speaker
placement, etc.) they can
control are limited and
it’s only a matter of time
before brands start to lose
their identity. In other
words, there’s only so
much you can do with that
space.
There have been quite a
few companies that have
tried to resolve this issue
over the past year while
promising to maintain
software support:
• Samsung Galaxy Fold
with an inner foldable
OLED display and a sec-
ondary screen on the front
these have been phones
that take different, more
cost-effective approaches
to uniqueness. The most
simple of these ap-
proaches being the layout
and arrangement of the
camera system. The front
camera has recently seen
a tremendous amount of
change over the past two
years. With the different
variations of the “notch”
to cameras that “pop-up”
from the outer casing of
the device, smartphone
manufacturers are truly
pushing, what I like to
call, silent innovation.
This kind of innovation
serves, as previously said,
to make the most out of
the space in a smartphone.
Examples of this “silent
innovation” include:
• Bending of the OLED
screen under the phone’s
metal housing to elimi-
nate the “chin”. (iPhone X
series and above)
• Curving the display
towards the side-edges
to cause an illusion that
eliminates the presence
of a side bezel. (Most
notable: Oppo’s “Water-
fall” display prototype)

prehend the manpower
required to develop apps
for each operating system.
In the case of startups, it’s
impractical as their goal
is to reach widespread
adoption while maintain-
ing spendings under the
budget.
On the ﬂip-side, since
most modern smart-
phones operate on either
of the two platforms,
any hardware change or
addition would require
a ton of work in the
software end by the
smartphone manufacturer
to update their framework
to allow for the main-
tenance of third party
support. This is a very
tedious job and doesn’t
motivate radical design
changes; that is, it’s hard
to adapt the software to
changes in hardware. To
put it simply, it just isn’t
ﬁnancially practical.
Even with these
widespread platforms,
the core functionality
of the devices are most
highlighted by their app
stores. In the world of
Android, Google leads
the industry with its play
• Google Pixel 4’s
motion sense, which uses
a Soli radar sensor to
detect hand gestures.
• Facial mapping and
recognition as a security
measure to unlock the
device. (Apple’s FaceID
and Google’s Face
Unlock)
• Depth mapping and
advanced image pro-
cessing using multiple
cameras.
• Pressure sensitive
displays and Taptic
engines to detect and
simulate depth while
force-pressing on the
screen. (Apple’s 3D
Touch)
• Precision cutting
a whole in a display to
house the front-facing
camera module. (Flagship
Samsung phones such as
S10 & Note 10 series)
With more advanced,
innovative solutions such
as under-display cameras
and port-less, water-proof
phones, it’s only a matter
of time before we witness
the next revolutionary, in-
dustry-standard form-fac-
tor for smartphones of our
future.
