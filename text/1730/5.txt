A
s the wheels

English foot-
ball groan
into action again after
an arduous fortnight of
international bullshit,
let’s have a look at what
we’ve actually missed.
£35+ match prices, hours
of advertisements, and
the weekends games
spread over 20 different
streaming services. Us
football fans love to mock
the NFL for its corporate
nature, but soon enough
the Barclays™ Premier®
League© will be just as
bad.
Advertisements and
corporations are ruining
the sport. Despite the
benefits to grassroots
football, like the ini-
tiatives funded by the
the eye-watering cost as a
one off. Even the cheapest
season tickets work out to
£31.50 a match. It’s clear
by the influx of families to
every cup game that fans
are not being prioritised.
The alternative is to
watch from home, on
the reputable streaming
service of your choice.
But when league games
are split between Sky
Sports, BT Sport, and
Amazon Prime Video,
the price skyrockets
once more. When you
consider minimum
contract lengths, a season
of Premier League in
your living room can set
you back £1500. Can you
really claim to be ‘for
the fans’ when you allow
advertisers and broadcast-
ers to mug them in this
manner?
to negotiate a better deal
for televised games.
Crucially, this included
an ‘equal share’ clause,
which guarantees every
club £79 million regard-
less of finishing position.
Originally, 12 teams span
off to create the Prem,
which has now grown to
20 teams. This, coupled
with the number of
countries worldwide that
lap up English football,
has made the EPL the
most profitable league
for clubs. Huddersfield
Town placed 20th in the
2018/2019 season, and
were relegated from the
Premier League to the
Championship. They still
wages to ensure that they
secure Pogba’s image
rights. This also means
that young homegrown
talent is overlooked for
sensationalist continental
players that are paid more
as clothes models than
football players.
Thisiswhy,asaChelsea
fan, I’m glad we have a
two-window transfer ban.
I’m glad we’re forced to
play at least a couple of
the players that we have
in our loan system, the
number of which could fill
a small European country.

The expectation of success
that every manager
faces in his first season
has caused a ridiculous
turnover of staff. We have
no continuity of direction,
with a new system touted
every August, only to be
denounced by February.
Maybe the vast amount
of money at stake means
that there is no hope
for change, but there
are better systems out
there. At any rate, if the
NFL successfully start
a franchise in London
then maybe there’ll be no
football to pay for.

It’s a shame that not
enough of this money
manages to improve the
experience of the fans.
Granted, many clubs have
recently implemented
much needed upgrades to
their stadiums. Manches-
ter City have famously
flirted with financial
fairplace due to the filthy
oil money that has greased
their turnstyles, and Spurs
eventually moved into
the soon be renamed Tot-
tenham Hotspur stadium.
