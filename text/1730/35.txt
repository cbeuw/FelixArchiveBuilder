“Riot has, in
short, decided
that they are
going to war
with Blizzard”
‘Project A’: The Tacti-
cal Shooter
The first game an-
nounced by Riot that is
completely separate from
League and the world of
Runeterra, ‘Project A’ is
a character-based tactical
shooter with a whole new
set of characters and a
fresh near-future Earth
setting. There are few
details available for now,
but on the gameplay side
a lot of focus seems to be
going toward developing
high-impact character
abilities and smooth
gunplay to keep the game
competitive. Furthermore,
a lot of investment is going
into high-end infrastruc-
ture changes, to combat
issues such as aimbots
and ‘peeker’s advantage’
(where latency means the
person peeking around a
corner gets information,
and a chance to shoot,
before the person on the
other side.) More details
will be shared throughout
2020.
Legends of Runeter-
ra: The Card Game
Ah, Riot isn’t even
trying to hide it at this
point: this is a Hearth-
stone-killer. However,
it doesn’t appear to be
just another clone. There
was a real sense from the
devs that this is a passion
project – one they’re
committed to keeping
free from the evils of
randomised loot boxes
for cards. The game will
feature League and other
Runeterra-based cham-
pions as powerful cards,
with a supporting cast of
cards with both familiar
and unfamiliar faces. This
project seems by far the
closest to completion,
with alpha pre-registration
already active and early
gameplay being streamed
after the main show. (If
you’re a card-game nut,
get in touch and let us
know what you think so
far!)
‘Project F’???:
The ARPG(?)
Yes, that is a lot of
question marks. Riot
conspicuously displayed
what appeared to be a
Diablo-style ARPG,
potentially with MMO
elements, in the back-
ground of their announce-
ments, but didn’t offer
any comment. I know;
they’re just teasing us at
this point. We’ll refrain
from diving too heavily
into speculation, but the
short gameplay clips of
an isometric Blitzcrank,
g o o m b a - s t o m p i n g
minions already look like
a blast.
Esports Manager
Finally! The return
of some form of fantasy
esports for League! The
game will feature two
modes: a campaign-style
single-player game, and
a ranked system where
you can compete against
others. Sadly, it will
initially launch with only
LPL teams in 2020 but
apparently will look to
expand to include other
regions. As soon as they
do, I’m creating what
I’m half-convinced will
actually be the 2020 G2
team with role-swapping
Perkz as support, Caps
as ADC, and Faker in
mid – the memes are just
too good to resist. There’s
further good news: a
portion of all proceeds
will be reinvested back
into the pro scene!
And the honourable
mentions…
There’s a couple of
other things worth men-
tioning here – yes, even
more. Firstly, there was
a very brief mention and
a snippet of a potential
new board game being
developed – but not
enough information to
say anything concrete
just yet. Secondly – Riot
announced a full-on
animated show called
Arcane, which seems to
be based on the history
of Jinx and Vi in the
conjoined microcosms
of the Runeterran cities
of Zaun and Piltover.
Champions like Ekko and
Ezreal were also spotted
in the extended trailer pre-
viewed during the show.
Fans of League have been
asking for it for years
and years – and finally,
Riot has delivered, with
an expected release date
within the next year.
So what does all this
mean?
The clue is in the
title. Not only has Riot
managed to mostly keep
the development of most
of these games a complete
secret, but they’ve also
managed to organically
announce them at the
perfect moment.
Blizzard has, for a
long time, had a powerful
influence on the Western
gaming market. With huge
blockbuster successes like
World of Warcraft and
Starcraft under their belt,
Blizzard has shaped entire
genres and arguably kick-
started the modern esports
phenomenon. Over the
years, they’ve expanded
their collection of games,
often championing a
single game per genre.
They have Hearthstone for
card games; Overwatch
for shooters; Heroes of
the Storm for MOBAs;
WoW for MMORPGs;
Diablo for ARPGs; and so
on. Each of these games
overlaps and (whether
canon or not) inherit lore
and style and context from
one another – Heroes of
the Storm, for example,
features characters from
across all of Blizzard’s
library. Each is also
managed via the Blizzard
launcher, a centralised app
for all their games.
Riot has, in short,
decided that they’re going
to war with Blizzard.
Having announced the
development of a suite of
games drawing from the
same universe – Runeterra
– they’ve set themselves
up to emulate the same
business model. This is
no accident; Riot has
even recently revamped
the launcher for League
into a more general Riot
Games launcher, with the
now-apparent intention of
using it as a base launcher
for a variety of games in
the same way as Blizzard
does. They even jokingly
referenced Blizzard’s
gaff last year (regarding
the comment on whether
players have phones)
while delivering their
Blizzard’s equivalents:
netcode for Overwatch
(and shooters in general)
and microtransactions for
Hearthstone.
And it’s the perfect
moment. Blizzard’s
recent controversies have
left them vulnerable – a
lukewarm Blizzcon last
year, the casual axing of
the entire Heroes of the
Storm esports scene, and
most recently banning and
rescinding the winnings
of a tournament player
who shouted “liberate
Hong Kong” in a post-
game interview. Riot must
have been planning these
announcements months in
advance – but fortune has
smiled upon them, as the
giants they’re hoping to
slay have shot themselves
in the foot just over a
week prior.
Only time will tell
if this incredibly bold
market takeover will be
successful – but aside
from all that, frankly, I’m
just excited to play some
amazing-looking games.

They’re going even
further: several of their
newly-announced games
will be direct competi-
tors to flagship Blizzard
titles. ‘Project A’ will
compete with Blizzard’s
character-based shooter
Overwatch, Legends of
Runeterra similarly seeks
to entice Hearthstone’s
playerbase, and the
ARPG-style game will
draw Diablo fans. More
than this, what little we
have heard about these
games so far seems to
aim to directly address
the biggest criticisms of
