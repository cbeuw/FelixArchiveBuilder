Giselle: a bold reimagination of a classic ballet
D
ada Masilo
is famous for
her works
which rework
the plots of well-known
classical ballet pieces.
Her previous works
include her interpretation
of Swan Lake which
included twists such as
a homosexual Siegfried,
and social commentary on
sexism and homophobia.
Her vision for Giselle is
equally refreshing, with
a focus on storytelling,
and presenting the au-
dience with unforgiving
protagonist.
Giselle (played by cho-
reographer, Dada Masilo
herself) is the young
peasant girl who falls in
love with the nobleman
Albrecht (played by
Lwando Dutyulwa).
After discovering that he
was already promised to
another woman, Giselle
dies of heartbreak. The
second act sees Giselle
summoned by a group of
vengeful spirits called the
Wilis. They are supernat-
ural women who have
the power to force men to
dance until death from ex-
haustion, and Giselle joins
them to enact her revenge.
The choreography of
Masilo’s Giselle is hugely
innovative and exciting.
The fusion of classical
ballet with contemporary
dance was done to per-
fection, and the addition
of African dance makes
the performance a unique
visual masterpiece. The
dance is far more expres-
sive and emotional than
an average ballet, and
the passion of the dance
makes the story feel much
more raw and real than
the traditional more con-
served story of Giselle.
A notable difference
from the original Giselle,
is the influence of African
culture, as Masilo re-
imagines the setting of
Giselle in South Africa.
This is very prominent in
the music that is layered
with African voices and
percussion. There is also
the addition of the scene
of Giselle going through
an African ritual with her
mother, and the changing
of the leader of the Wilis,
Myrtha, to an African
healer.
The stage production
also complemented the
dance immensely, to
create an immersive piece
of art. The stage and
costumes are minimal-
istic but impactful and
effective. The beautiful
red outfits of the Wilis are
particularly striking. They
symbolize viciousness
which contrast with the
white dresses of purity
and innocence in the
original.
The performance also
defies certain conventions
of ballet, and there is an
element of surprise that
keeps the audience on the
edge of their seats. There
was dialogue, chanting,
and acting, which all
contribute to the organic
storytelling.The inclusion
of nudity accentuates the
vulnerability of Giselle.
There was also the gen-
derbending of two of the
Wilis played by androgy-
nous male dancers, calling
into question the heter-
onormative culture and
gender norms of ballet.
Subversion of traditional
ballet is daring, and by
breaking well defined
boundaries, Masilo sheds
light on the infinite possi-
bilities of ballet.
Overall, Masilo’s
Giselle is an incredible
masterpiece, that is inno-
vative and unique. It is an
unapologetic piece of art
that is both ground-break-
ing and visually stunning.
When compared to the
original, Masilo’s Giselle
is filled with more drama
and raw emotion, making
it incredibly exciting. I
truly believe Masilo’s
Giselle has the best story-
telling through dance, and
I believe it is a must-see.
The Watsons: Jane Austen spin-off fiction fan club
L
aura Wade set
herself up for a
difficult task: to
finish, as a play,
a novel that Jane Austen
couldn’t complete. It fol-
lows the story of Emma
Watson, a young woman
used to a luxurious life-
style, who finds herself
dumped back home, and
financially dependent
on her family. Several
suitors are introduced,
from the local clergyman
to an awkward lord and
his flirtatious friend. The
introduction is familiar, at
least for a regular Austen
reader. That’s when the
original novel stops and
Wade comes in. Quite
literally - the character
Laura, portrayed by
Louise Ford, is the writer
herself, transported to a
fictional town in the 18th
century with her modern
language and electronic
devices.
The play starts strong-
ly, even before its official
start. The lights are on
and two characters are on
stage from the moment
the doors open, ignoring
the chatter among the
audience. Then, a rapid
succession of dialogues,
aided by Samuel West’s
clever direction, introduce
all the characters. There is
a ball with music, dance
and courtship, where the
relationships between
them become clear. These
scenes are well construct-
ed, dynamic without be-
ing confusing, and con-
tain the exact amount of
information we need to
understand the world of
the play.
When the source ma-
terial stops is where the
show falters. In a rather
long and unconvincing
scene, Emma Watson un-
derstands she is a char-
acter in a fictional work
and goes from shock to
nihilism, and then finally
to rage. The news reach-
es the other characters,
and the course of the sto-
ry suffers a violent turn.
They all abandon their
Austenian roles and desti-
nies to become their own
persons and write their
own stories - yep! It is as
cliche as possible, though
I concede it is funnier than
one might expect. Laura,
the writer, tries and fails
to keep control of the sto-
ry, in an obsessive pursuit
of the purest Austen style
- a recurrent reference in
the play, which really is
an extravagant homage
to the great author. The
contrasts between the real
and fictional world, and
the significant social and
technological differences
between the characters’
and the writer’s time pe-
riods are often the sourc-
es of comic relief. I don’t
think anyone has ever
described Candy Crush
in such accurate detail be-
fore!
Wade’s fatal flaw is
trying to touch upon too
many subjects, from fem-
inism to political legiti-
macy, from the sense of
purpose to the struggles of
the creative process. She
does raise good points: her
portrait of an artist’s vul-
nerability when creating
something new is beauti-
fully honest, and her con-
stant urge to question the
status quo, although not
new, is freshly done. But
everything is so fast and
inconsequential that some
topics are only treated su-
perficially, and tend to fall
into pseudo-intellectual-
ism (alright - you can cite
Rousseau, but what comes
from that?) or inexplica-
ble events that lack cred-
ible motives or build-ups.
In the end, this show
makes for an agreeable
and fun evening. It is just
a pity that it doesn’t go
deeper and sticks to sim-
ple comedy. Laura herself
said it - ‘I like it when
they clap!’

Dada Masilo is a genius when it comes to storytelling through dance, and her take on Giselle is more emotional,
raw and real than any other adaptation.
