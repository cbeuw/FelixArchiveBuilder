A Distortion of Orientalist Art
T
his tone is set
by the very first
piece in the exhi-
bition, the Prayer.
This painting by Frederick
Arthur Bridgman, is
supposed to capture two
individuals in a mosque,
engaged in the act of
prayer (salat). The subject
in the foreground stands
with both hands out-
stretched at his sides, face
up to the sky, while the
other arches his back and
holds a palm up in front
of his head awkwardly.
As a Muslim, I can inform
you that neither action is
a legitimate stage in salat
and the scene actually
contradicts the humility
and rigour inherent to the
ritual.
The question of artistic
intention is contentious,
and particularly sensitive
in the case of western
observation of cultures
where imperial hegemony
is historically rife. The
colonial context of the
orientalist movement
saw the commissioning
of large quantities of art
by North American and
European elite to perpet-
uate a political agenda of
white superiority. This is
demonstrated in much of
the art displayed in this ex-
hibition – local people of
the Middle East and North
Africa being presented as
idle or primitive in scenes
capturing everyday life.
An extension to this is
the completely fabricated
and perverted imaginings
of the harem (domestic,
women-only spaces that
are intended for the pres-
ervation of privacy and
modesty). Paintings such
as The Turkish Bath by
Jean-Auguste-Dominique
Ingres which depicts a
group of nude women
lounging in suggestive
poses, ironically seem to
obsessively fetishise the
harem, whilst portray-
ing it as an animalistic
Islamic practice to elite
western audiences. In the
exhibition’s final piece,
contemporary Turkish
artist Inci Eviner protests
and satirises this sexu-
alisation, presenting her
own fictitious Harem in
a looped video of women
engaged in bizarre, pos-
sessed interactions.
It is undeniable that
some level of genuine
admiration for the Islamic
world is suggested by
some of these pieces – for
example, Jean-Baptise
Vanmour’s illustration
of Ottoman wealth and
power in scenes of diplo-
matic ceremonies. Despite
this, an air of glib appro-
priation and ignorance is
often maintained – John
Frederick Lewis’ self-por-
trait as a ‘Middle Eastern’
shows him draped in
a sash that is actually
Indian. This is supported
by the fact that many of
these pieces were created
by artists who had never
travelled to the places
they portrayed, instead
relying on props and
other art for inspiration.
Indeed, it would seem
that art with exotic motifs
was the aim, rather than
art with accurate Islamic
influences. Though the
exhibition acknowledges
orientalism’s misrep-
resentative nature, the
captions predictably offer
fairly subdued criticism,
settling for terms such
as “romanticised” and
leaving it to the viewer
to consider the nuanced
and often deliberately
deceitful nature of the
orientalist movement.
Dutchman - A Discomforting Enlightenment
T
he playwright
Amiri Baraka,
a famous
American Civil
Rights activist known by
the name of LeRoi Jones,
wrote and produced
Dutchman in 1964, a time
when African Americans
were not afforded the
same constitutional rights
as white people. Racial
segregation, discrimina-
tion and violence were
commonplace and were
Baraka’s inspiration for
this tale.Today, unjustified
racial violence, in particu-
lar towards black men, is
consistently in the head-
lines, making this story as
relevant as ever.
Set in a subway
carriage, Dutchman
follows the story of two
strangers – Lula, an eccen-
tric, older white woman,
and Clay, an unassuming,
young black man – on a
journey across New York.
The potential lovers seem
to echo the familiar trope
of ‘forbidden’ biracial
romance between a white
female and a black male
that is most notably
explored in Shakespeare’s
Othello, with several key
distinctions. Lula is the
aggressor: she boards the
train eating an apple and
coquettishly moves about
the carriage to initiate a
flirtatious conversation
with Clay after accusing
him of staring at her
legs. Although he is at
first shocked by Lula’s
advances, Clay quickly
becomes intrigued when
she makes several correct
assumptions about who he
is, based on her stereotype
of black men.
The dance of seduction
continues to a horrifying
climax, suggesting that
the true casualty of the
biracial sexual struggle,
is the black man. Baraka’s
use of symbolism is
subtle but effective. The
setting of a moving train
highlights the continuous
presence of the racial
issues discussed – espe-
cially ironic given the
time since it was first
performed. The apples
Lula eats and offers to
Clay liken her to Eve,
committing the original
sin and causing human
suffering.
Both protagonists
have respective outbursts
which are noticed by
the other passengers on
the train. The contrast
between their reaction
of mild amusement at
Lula’s verbal tirade and
abject fear and revulsion
at Clay’s defensive
monologue is starkly rem-
iniscent of the systematic
criminalisation of black
men in media and society.
Clay is played by
James Barnes, whose
inconsistent New Jersey
accent does not do justice
to his otherwise powerful-
ly emotive performance.
Cheska Hill-Wood’s
maddeningly consum-
mate portrayal of Lula
incites the perfect level
of shock, embarrassment
and unease.
Lula freely and fre-
quently uses derogatory
terms such as ‘n****’,
which achieve the desired
effect of horror. However,
archaic references such
as ‘Uncle Tom’ (someone
subservientkeentowinthe
approval of white people)
and ‘Charlie Brown’ are
a little out of reach for
the modern audience. By
no means could this play
be described as easy to
watch but since when
have discussions about
racism been easy? The
director, Kaitlin Argeaux
commented that “to not
see colour” is a privilege
afforded mainly to Cau-
casians”, Dutchman is
a distressing but crucial
performance that renders
seeing and confronting
colour unavoidable.
With strong sexual
imagery, violence and
an unexpected finale,
Dutchman is sure to keep
you entertained. It’s a little
like watching a horror
movie - you’re scared and
uncomfortable but you
also don’t want it to end.
Be ready to have your
preconceptions about race
and identity questioned.
