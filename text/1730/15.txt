Red Palace
A
masked ball
at the Prince’s
Palace, for the
thousandth day
of his reign. There’s a
rumour going around that
the Prince will be dead
by morning. We are left
to wander through the
palace’s rooms, tasked
with finding out just what
is going on.
Such is the premise
of Shotgun Carousel’s
immersive theatre perfor-
mance, Red Palace. It’s
their latest large perfor-
mance since last year’s
well-received Divine
Proportions. While that
was centred around a
dining experience, this
year they’ve decided to
make it more accessible
with a performance-only
option. I think this is a
good idea, dinner being
a luxurious touch but not
essential to understanding
the performance. The
menu, put together by
Masterchef semi-finalist
Annie McKenzie, was de-
licious and appropriately
banquet-y - think smoky
slow-cooked lamb, melty
Camembert and toffee
apples in poison green.
Some staffing issues had
the show starting late so
alas, we didn’t quite have
time for dessert before
being whisked off to the
main performance - a real
shame.
We were given four
chimes of the bell to
‘explore the palace’. It
transpired that there were
four different rooms, and
we needed to go into each
of them to find out the
full story. It’s a pity this
wasn’t made clear from
the start – some people
flitted in and out of rooms,
or stopped for a cocktail
and thereby missed a
quarter of the plot.
The four sets were the
best part of the show, each
being their own self-con-
tained world. There was
a bath-house dripping
with water and littered
with seashells, where
a seaweed-encrusted
mermaid sang to us in a
siren’s voice. A chintzy,
tapestry-draped room
where we had our fortunes
told. An eerie forest where
wolves howled under the
full moon. And finally, a
little underground dive
with candlelit tables and a
striptease act.
Immersive theatre
always requires a fine
balance between sto-
rytelling and audience
interaction. I’m not sure if
Shotgun Carousel had the
balance quite right. My
fellow-ballgoer was asked
to pass a message from
one character to another,
but the character he gave
it to seemed nonplussed.
Unlike full-on immersive
shows like Wolf of Wall
Street, the exploration and
interaction here was more
limited - we essentially
went into the four rooms
for a piece of the plot in
each one.
After all the buildup,
the ending turned out
to be rather brief and
anticlimatic. Beyoncé’s
“Run The World (Girls)”
started blaring from the
speakers along with other
female-centric anthems in
a bizarre feminist twist.
This was strange to say
the least as there hadn’t
been so much as a whiff of
feminist rhetoric till then.
Nonetheless, Red
Palace made for an
entertaining and unusual
evening. The atmosphere
was certainly magical,
with everyone donning
masks and many attend-
ees in extravagant gothic
costume.Despiteaslightly
put-together feel (terrible
bartenders, sets relying
heavily on draped fabric),
strong performances by
the actors carried the
day. Steffi Walker was
particularly memorable as
The Mermaid, delivering
a haunting mix of cruelty
and charm. On the whole,
Red Palace had great
potential for a thrilling
night out. I would just
have loved to see it with
a tighter plot and more
space for exploration.
Up Pompeii - an audio revival
O
ne quick look
around the
audience and
I soon realise
my companion and I are
easily the youngest in the
room. I’m also the only
non-white person there
(unless we’re counting
the ushers). We’re at a
live radio recording of
Up Pompeii, that BBC
comedy classic about a
ne’er-do-well slave in
Ancient Rome and the
caprices of the family he
works for. Not heard of it
before? Understandable,
given that it was first
released in 1969 – long
before many of the read-
ers of Felix were born.
Back in its heyday the
sitcom attracted up to 12
million viewers. Much
of its appeal came from
the idiosyncratic comedi-
an Frankie Howerd, who
played the title role of
slave Lurcio. Yes, Lur-
cio, as in ‘he-who-lurks’.
It’s all about the cheeky
faux-Latin names here,
and there’s a full house-
hold of them – the bum-
bling master Ludicrus
Sextus, his promiscuous
wife Ammonia, their ri-
diculously naïve son Nau-
sius and their not-so-inno-
cent daughter Erotica.
The cast for this 50th
anniversary revival is
brilliant. Knowing how
much the original depend-
ed on Howerd’s unique
charm, producer Barnaby
Eaton-Jones has gotten
David Benson, known for
his skills at mimicry, to
impersonate him as per-
fectly as possible. Benson
has Howerd’s frequent
audience asides, curious
little tics, and eccentric
catchphrases down pat.
As audiences, we’re ad-
monished for laughing
– ‘Shut your face!’, ‘Oh,
please yourselves’ – by
Lurcio, which of course
only makes us laugh
more. There’s comedy
legend Tim Brooke-Tay-
lor as baddie Captain
Treacherus, who ram-
pages around looking for
his escaped galley slave
Voluptua (played very
coquettishly by Camille
Coduri, of Doctor Who
fame). It’s a star-studded
cast and every character
is played just how you
would imagine them to
be – the lecherous hus-
band terrified of his wife,
the teenage boy desperate
to lose his virginity, the
man-eating nymphomani-
ac…
Wait, the what? I know,
I know. Fifty years on,
the main problem with
Up Pompeii is that the
character clichés it re-
lied so heavily on are in-
creasingly less relevant in
the modern age. Another
core part of its humour is
bawdiness; the script is
chock full of intentionally
bad puns double-entren-
dres, with many a nudge-
and-wink at the audience.
It’s very farcical and pan-
to-y, the audience love it
but for me it gets old quite
quickly (pun not intended,
ha-ha). There’s a sense
that the cast could be do-
ing much better comedy
were they not constrained
by the script; the funniest
bits are when something
goes wrong and they ad-
lib.
It’s a fascinating win-
dow into the humour of
two generations ago. By
the end the audience has
gotten to their (slightly
arthritic) feet to give a
standing ovation, and I’m
clapping too. Even if it’s a
bit dated, Up Pompeii still
manages to draw laughs,
especially with this stellar
cast. I’m actually rath-
er tempted to watch the
original TV series now.
It may be ancient history
– but like Vesuvius, it’s
still capable of causing a
rumble.
The audio recording
of Up Pompeii will be re-
leased on Amazon, iTunes
and at spitefulpuppet.com
this November.
