Love, Me and Compost:Adouble bill of love and trash
MTSoc and Dramsoc comes together for a night of... you guessed it, musical theatre and drama!
T
eaming up for
a double-billed
show, our very
own MTSoc and
Dramsochaveputtogether
an original musical titled
Love, Me, and an original
play titled Compost,
the latter of which was
recently performed at the
Edinburgh Fringe Festival
over the summer.
Love, Me
L
ove, Me displays
the relationship
between Ivy
and Bill, both
at its beginning and its
seemingly approaching
end, spanning around a
decade, exploring the im-
portance of loving oneself
in maintaining strong in-
terpersonal relationships.
Writing an original mu-
sical is no small feat, so
massive congratulations
to writers Chris Koray
Araz, Fabiola Mann and
Afkar Malik, all current
students at Imperial.
However, much as it
saddens me to admit this,
the music feels uninspired
more often than not.
This is both melodically
and lyrically, with some
extremely cliché lines
like ‘she is imperfect,
but I still love her’. They
say one of the first rules
to good creative writing
is ‘show, don’t tell’, but
the extremely literal
lyrics leave little to the
imagination. Throughout
the show, it feels like the
spoken dialogue is much
stronger than the lyrics
in progressing the story.
Although the intentions
behind portraying Ivy’s
inner voice (simply called
Voice, portrayed by Tash
Cowan) directly are clear,
the character is often ir-
ritating, overly dramatic,
and turns ‘show’ to ‘tell’
consistently, taking away
any room for individual
thought processing on
the events of the musical.
Cowan does her best
with the character, but
the writing lets her down
considerably. Indeed, a
vital issue with the writing
is the one-dimensionality
of pretty much every
character. This includes
Ivy, the central character
of the plot. At least we
get to see her wonderfully
acted by Ellie Morgan and
Vasiliki Kalogianni in two
different periods of her
life.
The singing and acting
are both very strong
“One of the
highlights
of the show
was when
the guitarist
dropped his
sheet music”
“...the play is
much deeper
than funny
one-liners, as
it is, at its core,
an exploration
of corruption”
across the board, and
the orchestration is well
balanced and full-bodied,
helping to elevate the
score. Well, for the most
part anyway. One of the
highlights of the show
was when the guitarist
dropped his sheet music,
and had to sit there in
awkward silence, waiting
for an appropriate time to
pick it up from the floor.
The direction and the
lighting are also strong,
with one complementing
the other, often amplify-
ing the funny and heartfelt
moments from the script,
which would otherwise
have gone unnoticed by
the audience.
There are some musical
highlights, namely a
waltzy tune halfway
through performed by
Ivy (Morgan), which is
as close as the show gets
to feeling complete, both
technically and plot-wise,
and the finale, which is
predictably cheesy, but
cute regardless. Suc-
cessfully driving home
its message of self-love,
the final song and its
presentation are effective.
Although the song is very
quick to make its point, it
is overly long, repeating
itself time and time again,
not adding anything new
to what has been said in
its first minute.
Overall, Love, Me is en-
tertaining, well-acted and
makes its point heard loud
and clear. The writers have
achieved the extremely
difficult task of writing
a complete musical from
scratch, which I applaud.
However, the production
falls short in its writing,
which lacks the subtlety
needed to be more than
just entertainment.
Compost
W
ritten by
C a l u m
Drysdale,
a n o t h e r
current Imperial College
undergraduate, Compost
tells the tale of two
ex-government workers
who attempt to scam the
wealthy homeowners of
Amersham, by selling
bins that supposedly turn
plastic into compost.
The acting in Compost is
outstanding. Specifically,
the manic personality of
one of the con artists (Ben
Hayward) which very
sucessfully complements
the self-assured demean-
our of his co-worker
(Vaisnavi Ravichandran).
Colm Gleeson, a new
addition to the cast after
the end of the sucessful
Edinburgh run, replacing
Prithu Banerjee, plays one
hell of a drag queen. He
is wonderful, delivering
an extremely high-energy
performance that elevates
the play every time he is
on stage.
The play caters towards
millennials, referencing
things like Britney Spears’
mental breakdown in
2007 and Kim Possible.
However the play is
much deeper than funny
one-liners, as it is, at its
core, an exploration of
corruption, which feels
extremely relevant in
today’s political climate.
The audience is left to
ponder over possible
parallels to current affairs.
Luckily the play never
takes itself too seriously,
avoiding falling into the
pitfall of earnestly trying
to push a message, prefer-
ing instead to simply have
choice of music (mostly
early-2000s pop tunes)
is also extremely smart,
further adding to the ‘mil-
lennial’feel and sprinkling
moments of lighthearted
comedy in what is often a
lot to digest.
The play is extremely
fast paced, and quite
confusing at times. I think
it suffer slightly from the
length of time that it has
been running, begining
with previews in mid-Au-
gust and only just coming
to an end now. The play
has clearly undergone a
lot of development and
while no doubt everything
made sense to the cast, we
the audience felt a bit left
behind.
Just when everything
starts making sense (if I
can reasonably use the
word) the bonkers ending
upset everything. Really.
I can’t quite describe it,
but I can reassure you that
whatever it is that happens
is incredibly funny.
Compost is extremely
entertaining. Its abstract
nature is at times a bit
much, but at its best,
it is simultaneously
laugh-out-loud funny and
thought-provoking. At its
worst, it goes slightly over
the top and tips into being
confusing.
