apitalism: in its
modern form,
it’s the way the
world works,
and has worked, for the
last 200 years. It shapes
more than just our eco-
nomic life but encroaches
on our politics, our cli-
mate, our culture, our very
psychology. Although it
dictates our lives, it can
still remain a mystery to
many of us, with many
key ideas locked away
in dusty tomes from the
19th or 20th centuries.
In this series, I hope to
make these ideas more
accessible and answer
the question: What is
Capitalism?
chair factory. They agree
to pay you £10 per hour of
your working time. This
time is where you use your
labour power to perform
labour. It doesn’t matter
are contributing exactly
£10 an hour of value, the
employer is not making
a profit or a loss – they
may as well do nothing.
This leads to a logical,
yet stunning conclusion:
you are contributing more
than £10 an hour of value
(say £25 an hour), and the
‘surplus value’ (£15 an
hour) is being pocketed
by the employer as profit.
This profit was gener-
ated by the worker yet is
kept by the employer who
has performed no labour.
This idea of surplus value
doesn’t just apply to fac-
tories and the manufac-
turing industry, but to all
industries. Whenever you
are working a job, you
are generating more value
for the company than the
company is paying you (if
this were false you would
no longer be working
there!). This value is then
taken by the owners of the
business, i.e. the share-
holders, as dividends.
Shareholders hold shares
due to their investments
into the company, and
their ability to make
investments comes from
their wealth: that is to
say, capital. These are the
capitalists that give their
name to capitalism.
Economists have come
to differing moral judg-
ments on this relationship.
Some describe it as fair,
arguing that the profits are
well deserved rewards of
capitalists who have taken
a risk by investing their
capital into a business, and
that as workers enter into
wage labour ‘voluntarily’,
it cannot be called unjust.
Many others argue oth-
erwise, identifying wage
labour as an exploitative
system where capitalists
leech off labourers, who,
due to socio-economic
factors arising from other
aspects of capitalism,
have no choice but to
perform wage labour to
survive.

in: capitalists are, by defi-
nition, an elite minority
class, and workers are
the subjugated majority
class. Critics of capitalism
define the working class
as the group of people that
have no wealth/capital to
live off and are thus are
made to sell their labour
power to survive and
meet their material needs.
Meanwhile the capitalist
class have wealth, and
can use that wealth to
purchase land, factories,
offices, commodities.
These things are what
labourers work with in
order to produce goods
and create services for the
capitalist to sell, and are
collectively referred to as
the ‘means of production’
and are owned by the cap-
italist, not the worker. By
investing capital, hiring
workers, and the surplus
value of the workers’
labour as profits, the
capitalist can live off their
wealth without having
to perform any labour.
This is what divides the
working class from the
capitalist class.
how much or how well
you work, you get paid
a fixed wage. But why
should a company agree
to pay you £10 an hour for
the labour you perform in
that time? What’s in it for
them?
The labour you perform
generates value – in this
case, taking the raw ma-
terials (wood) and adding
value to it by performing
your labour on it and
turning it into a chair. The
chair is worth more than
the raw wood because of
the work you put in to it,
and now the employer can
sell the chair for a higher
price. Every hour, you
work on chairs and add
value to the wood. If your
labour is contributing less
than £10 an hour of value,
the employer is making a
loss by paying you £10 an
hour to work at the factory

terminate the contract
and bid you adieu. If you

While we have looked
at the worker-employer
relationship in an isolated
sense, there are further
questions to consider.
Why is wage labour
viewed as an involuntary
action? Where did the
capitalist’s wealth come
from? What does it mean
for capitalists to ‘own the
means of production’?
What role does the state
play in this? All this, and
more, will be answered in
next week’s article, where
we will look at the concept
of private property. Stay
tuned!

The word itself makes
us think of corporations
and consumerism,
markets and money. But
the pre-eminent aspect of
capitalism is the relation-
ship between a worker
and their employer. The
employer enters into an
agreementwiththeworker
whereby the worker sells
their labour power, i.e.
their capacity to perform
labour, in exchange for
money in the form of
wages, whether they be
determined on an hourly
or yearly basis.
This relatively simple
concept is referred to as
‘wage labour’ by political
economists. However,
there are logical con-
sequences to such a
system that may not be
immediately obvious. For
example, let’s say you
work for a company, at a
