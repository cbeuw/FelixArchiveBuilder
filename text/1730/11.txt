Meet the Editors: Ozbil - The Fanatical One
H
aving joined
Felix Arts as
a writer last
year, I often
think about how different
life would have been had
I joined sooner. I first
heard about Felix Arts
from my housemate,
and quickly realised that
this would be one of the
best ways to enjoy the
London theatre scene on
a student budget – and
enjoy it I have! Having a
an endless source of free
press tickets allowed me
to see productions that
I wouldn’t otherwise be
able to afford. Now a fifth
year medical student, I
have found myself not
only writing for, but also
editing th Arts section of
Felix.
As you might have
guessed already, I tend
to be more interested in
the performaning arts.
I’ve seen Hamilton four
times (twice for free,
thanks to kind strangers
on Twitter!!!) and Harry
Potter and the Cursed
Child five times (I may
have found a way to rig
their lottery, which sadly, I
can no longer do). I loved
War Horse so much that I
went again with a friend
the day after seeing it for
the first time with another
friend. I even met Sara
Bareilles on the opening
night of Waitress, which,
frankly, made my life.
My involvement in
drama started at a young
age, taking part in various
school productions. My
initial acting career was
cut short when I started a
short-lived experiment in
playing the trumpet. This
didn’t last long.
My mum and I have
always had a tradition
when I was growing up.
Every September, my
mum and I would buy
tickets for the Cyprus
International Theatre
Festival and go see every
single play available for
the entire month. We
managed to keep this up
until I left for university,
and even after when my
brother took on my role,
and I lived vicariously
through them.
Once I came to
Imperial, the flame I once
had for acting was reignit-
ed after I auditioned to be
a part of the ICSM Drama
production of You Can’t
Take It With You, where
I played the role of the
Russian ballet instructor.
What a blast! Ever since
then, I have been an active
part of the ICSM Drama
family and have enjoyed
every second of it.
In short, the theatre
scene in London has been
a defining part of my
university life, and it was
surprisingly affordable.
Come join us at Felix
Arts if that sounds like
something you’re interest-
ed in. We’re to be found

Noises Off
H
ailed as ‘iconic’
and as ‘the
funniest farce
ever written’, I
thought I was in for a treat
when I went to see Noises
Off at the Garrick Theatre.
Having been revived on
Broadway various times,
I was sure that the play
would be nothing short of
magnificent. Oh, boy, was
I wrong.
Noises Off is pretty
much one of the earlier
examples of a play-with-
in-a-play. Divided into
three acts, the first act fo-
cuses on the technical re-
hearsal (the night before
the official opening), the
second act on the opening
night, and the final act on
the closing night, months
down the line, displaying
the sheer incompetence
of both cast and crew in a
fictional play called Noth-
ing On. The Noises Off
audience gets to watch the
events unfold both from
where the Nothing On au-
dience would be sat and
from the backstage at dif-
ferent points in the show.
Overall the cast is very
strong. There isn’t too
much acting involved, as
the play relies heavily on
physical comedy, but what
acting there is is done re-
ally well. Where the cast
really deserves credit is
the incredible precision of
their movement through-
out the play, shutting and
opening doors at exact-
ly the right moments ,
throwing props around
and moving through the
precise choreography re-
quired for the show to
work at all.
Unfortunately, while
impressive, the physical
comedy just isn’t funny.
What I thought would be
a laugh-out-loud evening
consisted of maybe a few
giggles. Some members
of the audience seemed
to really enjoy it - sadly,I
found their unrestrained
hilarity funnier than what
was on stage. I might have
given the show a pass had
it contained any deeper
message behind the un-
successful hilarity, but un-
fortunately it was entirely
devoid of one.
While I really don’t
like the term ‘cringewor-
thy’, I can’t think of any
other way to describe the
play, as the humour was
extremely cheap through-
out. I get the attempts by
the play trying to sym-
bolise life itself and how
it is often a bigger mess
than anticipated, but as
an audience member, it is
only possible to come to
this conclusion if you are
forcing yourself to come
to a conclusion. Overall,
although a completely
harmless bit of staging,
Noises Off fails to de-
liver either the promised
laughs or a point to the
gauche buffoonery.
