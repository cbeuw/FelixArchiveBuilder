Gauguin Portraits
Ian McKellen On Stage
A
s you enter
the exhibition,
the first room
is filled with
self-portraits of Gauguin.
To walk into any room
of self-portraits would
give the impression of
a self-centred creator,
but Gauguin’s portraits
strike one as particularly
narcissistic, given there
are several oil paintings
where he has painted him-
self in the image of Jesus.
Alongside inscriptions
of his own name, there
are often the names of
friends or family to whom
the portraits were gifted.
It seems Gauguin had a
difficult time with people;
on one occasion the dedi-
cation of the portrait was
changed halfway through.
A family quarrel perhaps?
Throughout the exhibi-
tion, Gaugain’s peculiar
wooden and ceramic
sculptures are arranged
centrally and given pride
of place. These demon-
strate immense skill and
are interesting to look
at, but the oil-on-canvas
portraits are also far
from conventional. His
use of colour is intense
and subjects are rarely
depicted sitting or with
their families behind
them. In the “family
and friends” collection,
there is Young Breton
Woman. In this portrait
an aristocrat’s daughter
is seated beneath a coat
of arms and fleur-de-lys.
The indication of social
standing is usual for a
portrait, but Gauguin also
added a sculpture of his
own in the background - a
figure of a naked woman
exuding menstrual blood.
The combination of this
sculpture with the sub-
ject’s dejected facial ex-
pression give the painting
a disturbing quality. The
exhibition caption tells us
that, unsurprisingly, the
aristocrat did not buy the
portrait.
Discomfort upon
viewing his works con-
tinues, especially those
that were created during
his time in Polynesia.
Without context, many of
these are beautiful, and at
first glance it is almost re-
freshing to see non-white
women as the subjects
in a post-impressionist
exhibition. However, once
it is learned that Gaugain
“married” two of these
women when they were
13 and fathered their
children, it is difficult to
see any beauty in Gau-
guin’s depictions of them.
The exhibition also
includes surrogate por-
traits. These are still-life
paintings that have been
interpreted to represent
important people in Gau-
guin’s life. A surrogate of
Van Gogh is his sunflow-
ers; the rich colours of
these paintings give them
incredible depth, and it
is Gauguin’s depiction
of flowers, whether they
are to represent people
or not, that stand out as
his most striking work.
Given what we’ve learned
about his views earlier on
in the exhibition, though,
it is difficult to want one
of his prints, however
beautiful, on a notebook
or a cushion.
S
ir Ian McKellen:
the mere prospect
of seeing him
live would stir up
excitement in any Lord of
the Rings or Shakespeare
fan. And that was very
much how I felt – I mean,
who wouldn’t want to see
Gandalf live? McKellen’s
one-man show is a tribute
to his 80th birthday and
50 years of acting, with
the proceeds going to the-
atre charities. Well-versed
in Shakespeare, Chekov
and Beckett, McKellen
has also acted on the big
screen as Gandalf and
Magneto. Throughout the
show, his passion for live
theatre and Shakespeare
was clear. However, whilst
advertised as involving
“Tolkien, Shakespeare,
Others and YOU”, the
focus of the show was
on Shakespeare and not
on the other aspects as
promised.
I was initially buzzing
with excitement, hoping
that he would shed some
light on his stint in Lord
of the Rings. The show
opened with McKellen
reading a passage from
Tolkien’s Lord of the
Rings, including his
famous “You shall not
pass!” line. However, the
passage was read a little
quickly – at times, the
words melded into one
another, and it almost
seemed like he was
rushing through it. After
the short 10 minutes of
Tolkien and a few swings
of his sword Glamdring
(which was the highlight
of the show for me!),
McKellen moved on and
never returned to Middle
Earth.
McKellen went on to
talk extensively about
his personal life. He
grew up in Lancashire
and was drawn to theatre
from a young age, with
a penchant for Shake-
speare’s works. McKellen
soon realised that his
enthusiasm for theatre
warranted his pursuit
of acting as a full-time
career. And that is what
he did, progressing from
small local productions
to the Royal National
Theatre; McKellen went
on to win every major
theatrical award in the
UK at least once. Whilst it
was interesting to find out
more about McKellen’s
story, this section of the
show was perhaps more
drawn-out than required.
The second half of
the show focused on
McKellen’s experiences
of Shakespeare’s works.
McKellen went through
each of Shakespeare’s
plays individually, talking
about his own personal
experience and doing
snippets of his lines. This
would have been ideal for
a Shakespeare fan; indeed,
many members of the
audience seemed to thor-
oughly enjoy themselves.
However, going through
all sixty-six plays was a
rather lengthy process.
For someone like me, who
is not hugely well-versed
in Shakespeare, many of
the quips and anecdotes
went over my head and I
found myself lost at times.
Overall, I am glad to
have seen a household
name like McKellen in the
flesh. For the Shakespear-
ean fan, this would have
been an ideal evening; for
everyone else, it may be
a struggle to engage fully
with the entire show.
