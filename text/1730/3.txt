O
ur reporters
g e n e r a l l y
noted several
things.
Firstly, there were a
very high – even a vast
majority – of students
who seemed unaware of
the allegations against
the Prince and thus were
initially confused by the
questions asked. This
could be interpreted as
either apathy, or a lack of
knowledge. There have
been speculations among
UK commentators that
the mainstream media has
suppressed the news to
some degree; this could
be an explanation.
There were a variety
of responses from stu-
dents who were aware.
These ranged from
condemnations to a com-
plete lack of concern – the
diversity was very broad.
Several responses took
the perspective that the
Prince is ‘innocent until
proven guilty’ and that
the College, as a result,
should act as if he is inno-
cent. Indeed, the College’s
reticence to comment
directly on the Prince’s
visit (as opposed to the
event itself) seems to
match this perspective. As
one reporter put it, “that’s
Imperial in a nutshell –
trust in institutions.”
There were a few
respondents who deemed
the visit “for the greater
good of the university”, in
order to provide students
with entrepeneurship. One
respondent in particular
took this view until the
extent of the allegations
was explained, and then
once informed stated that
they disapproved of the
visit.
The number of students
who actively opposed the
decision was fewer than
expected, but significant.
One student explained that
they didn’t disapprove
because they didn’t feel
that the College hosting
the event amounted to an
endorsement of Prince
Andrew or Pitch@Palace.
However, others disa-
greed and considered the
decision highly controver-
sial – and stated explicitly
that they felt it did amount
to an endorsement.
Lastly, there were
students who simply
seemed torn. Many of
these seemed to fall into
the ‘innocent until proven
guilty’ camp, but felt
inherently uncomfortable
with the situation.
The lack of consensus
shows how prickly the
situation was; and how
students need to converse
about these issues in order
to increase awareness and
reach their own conclu-
sions.
Editor’s Note:
One aspect of the con-
versation I feel has gone
overlooked is the Col-
lege’s abysmal response.
One can argue either way
that the decision to host
the event and the Prince
was acceptable or not.
What is not acceptable
was the College statement
on the matter.
Felix explicitly asked
the College about the
message that the decision
might send to young
women, the College’s
thoughts or priorities in
that type of decision-mak-
ing, and how they plan
to address those feelings.
They completely ignored
those questions.
A stance such as
‘innocent until proven
guilty’ would have been
a perfectly acceptable
response, whether one
personally agrees or not.
Even refusing to comment
on innocence or guilt
directly, but providing
some reasoning for the
decision, would have
sufficed. What does not is
disregarding the question
and spending the entire
statement boasting about
the entrepreneurial
benefits, with not a whit
of concern expressed for
how it may make students
feel. I personally feel
that the impact on young
women at the College was
not considered at the time
of the decision, or really
since.
Indeed, the statement
given originally was
almost purely about
entrepreneurship – a
spokesperson had to send
a follow-up email the next
day with a tidbit about a
‘code of conduct’ external
events must follow on
campus. To me, this just
reinforces the impression
that the feelings of stu-
dents were not important
enough to the College to
factor into the decision.
It was, at best, an after-
thought. The priorities of
the College were made
quite clear – and this
is what I find to be the
travesty.
The College needs
to restructure its deci-
sion-making process so
that decisions are not
made in isolation, but
with a holistic sense of
the situation and the
affected stakeholders.
This can be provided by
integrating more conver-
sation between different
College divisions into the
decision-making process.
They also need to commit
to transparency with their
students – that much is
very clear.

Imperial Launches J-IDEA Institute
I
mperial has launched
a new institute as
part of the School
of Public Health in
White City this week,
targeted at predicting and
preventing global health
crises.
The institute, dubbed
J-IDEA for the Abdul
Latif Jameel Institute for
Disease and Emergency
Analytics, will utilise
advanced mathematical
modelling and data
science techniques to
research and understand
the health and economic
causes and repercussions
of disease.
Over 200 researchers
will work on J-IDEA
projects, creating a
world-leading centre in
the field. A core focus of
their work will be devel-
oping and implementing
actual real-world strate-
gies and policies out of
the expertise available;
in particular there will
be emphasis placed on
building local expertise in
lower-income countries.
This diverse approach
to tackling epidemics,
uniting medics, statis-
ticians, data scientists,
and epidemiologists,
will allow for an inter-
disciplinary approach to
solving global healthcare
problems – a core benefit
of the College’s moves
to White City in general.
Rather than feeding
information from one
academic field to another,
researchers from different
areas will collaborate
from earlier in the process,
allowing for faster and
more effective response.
Their research will also
cover other areas, such as
rapid response to natural
and humanitarian disas-
ters and extreme climate
events. This further ties
into the study of epide-
miology – disasters often
cause outbreaks of disease
for various reasons.
The institute was

opened with the help of
£25 million of funding
from Saudi-based charity
Community Jameel,
which is a consortium of
philanthropies run by the
international Abdul Latif
Jameel conglomerate.
This is their first project
at a UK university, though
they have also funded
initiatives at universities
across the globe such as
MIT.
The new institute on White City campus aims to provide rapid response to epidemics and natural disasters,
bringing together hundreds of researchers
