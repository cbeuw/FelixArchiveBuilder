The failure to block
pornography has not
gone down well
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
S
tudents from
around campus
are reconsidering
their degree
aspirations following
the news that the UK
government is not going
to block pornography.
One student, Bamish
Heck, 3rd Year Geophys-
ics, was shocked by the
news. “I was relying on
the wank-bank ban, as
my grades have tanked.
I’ve been beating my
meat so vigorously since
my parents dropped me
off that my old man is
about to drop off. I mean,
he recently had a stroke,
but let’s not get into that.
The only thing that can
save my genitals would
be forbidding the obscene
screen. And my grades.
Unfortunately nothing can
be done for papa.”
Another student, Laid-
rien Damoury told Neg-
afelix, “I don’t know what
I’ll do. If I carry on at this
rate, I’ll end up in a sticky
situation, and I’ll have run
out of toiletpaper. I’ve
already downgraded from
four ply to three. Surely
my arse cannot be made
to suffer further just to
satisfy the demands of the
ﬂesh.” Negafelix thinks
that this is a matter of
what you’re into.
Steve Yobs, head of
IT at Imperial was espe-
cially disappointed by
the failure to implement
the ban: “It was my last
hope to stop people from
masturbating in Central

Porn Block Failure Blamed for low 2:1
This week, you see your
ﬂatmate wandering
around in dirty pants
eating a pie
Something’s ﬁshy.
You hope its the pie
This week you’re an
international student
You claim diplomatic
immunity after failing
your course but agree to
meet with your lecturer’s
parents
This week your lecturer
asks how far you’re
willing to go for good
grades
You sacriﬁce your social
life and mental health for
the next 4 years
This week you are a ﬁrst
year Chemist
You learn how to bake a
cake
Gotta do the cooking by
the book
This week you stand in
the Autumn elections
You lose
At least you now know
everyone hates you
This week you buy
£50 worth of Imperial
merchandise
You now own a hoodie
that lets everyone else
know you’re a wanker
This week you attend
graduation
You can’t help but notice
how well oiled Galice
Fast’s handshake is
This week you are the
DUP.
You throw Boris Johnson
under a bus while
screaming something
incoherent about abortion
This week you are
China and you disarm
your enemies of their
most powerful anti-tank
weapons
You put a 20p tax on
plastic bags
This week you are Sports
Night.
You are well attended
For once
This week you decide not
to procrastinate anymore
You write 12 horoscopes
instead. You’re welcome
Library. Most of the
students here are animals
that get off on knowing
that I know exactly what
they’re watching when
they’re watching it. You
can wipe the mess off the
ﬂoor but you can never
wipe it from memory.”
It is widely expected
that the College will
comment on this issue in
the future, just as soon
as the press team have
ﬁnished procrasturbating.
We look forward to
providing updates over
the course of the coming
year. We’ll only ﬁnish
when you do.
“You can wipe
the mess off
the floor, but
you can never
wipe it from
memory”
