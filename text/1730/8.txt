United States Supreme Court Weighs New LGBTQ+
Rights Cases
Three cases will decide whether LGBTQ+ Americans have any protection from discrimination in employment

P
rotection from
dismissal on
the grounds of
sexual orientation
or gender identity was
up for debate before the
US Supreme Court this
week, in the first three
LGBTQ rights cases of
the last 2 years. The cases
referenced Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act, which
bans discrimination in
hiring, pay, and dismissal
on the basis of an individ-
ual’s “race, color, religion,
sex, or national origin.”
Title VII became law
in 1964, well before the
gay rights movement, so
LGBTQ+ people were
not explicitly protected.
Since, rights for LGBTQ+
people have been ex-
ecutive policy and so
have varied; the Obama
administration issued a
memo advising the Justice
Department that Title VII
applied to transgender
workers, advice reversed
by the Trump administra-
tion in 2017 along with a
wider push-back against
transgender people’s
rights. Since 28 states
have no local protections
for LGBTQ+ people,
these varying federal
guidelines remain the only
legal defense against dis-
crimination. This week’s
court cases will finally
define LGBTQ+ peoples’
federal rights.
Two of the cases are
similar and relate to em-
ployment rights for sexual
orientation. Bostock
v Claymore County
concerns a court official,
Gerald Bostock, who
worked with exemplary
recordsfortenyearsbefore
coming out by joining a
local gay softball league.
He was promptly fired
for “conduct unbecoming
of a county employee.”
Claymore county alleges
that Bostock abused
county funds, but did not
accuse Bostock until after
he filed his complaint.
The second case, Zarda
v Altitude Express Inc,
references a skydiving
instructor, Donald Zarda,
who claims he was fired
for not conforming to the
“straight male macho ste-
reotype” after a customer
complained.
Although sexuality is
not directly mentioned
by Title VII, Zarda and
Bostock’s lawyers claim
orientation is still protect-
ed. Their clients’ behavior
– being attracted to other
men – would not have
caused their firings if they
were women. Therefore,
their firings constituted
sex discrimination and
breach Title VII. Employ-
ers, however, have main-
tained that such a change
in interpretation is judicial
overreach and should be
within the purview of
Congress instead.
The third case, Harris
Funeral Homes v Equal
Employment Opportunity
Commission, involves
Aimee Stephens, a trans-
gender woman. After
working with the funeral
home for six years, she
came out as trans and
was fired two weeks later.
Her lawyers argue that
she was discriminated
against on the basis of sex
because she failed to fit the
stereotypes of her biolog-
ical sex. Previously, the
Supreme Court has held
that employers cannot dis-
criminate against women
for being insufficiently
feminine. Therefore,
since Stephens was not
presenting as sufficiently
male (i.e. conforming to
her biological sex), she
should not have been dis-
criminated against either.
Again, in oral arguments
Harris Homes argued that
extending protections to
transgender people would
be overreach, since they
contend Congress has the
exclusive right to update
the Civil Rights Act’s
meaning.
Unlike other LGBTQ+
rights cases, religious
freedom has not been a
primary issue, despite
Bostock’s employer being
represented by the Chris-
tian nonprofit the Alliance
Defending Freedom, an
LGBTQ+ people would
cause “social upheaval.”
Both liberal and conserv-
ative justices referenced
transgender peoples’
access to bathrooms, due
to disputed concerns of
violence from allowing
biological men into
women’s environments.
This topic is a touchstone
of the American debate
on transgender rights, and
was mentioned despite
bathrooms not being
explicitly linked to any
of the three cases being
considered.
How strongly the Court
defers to Congress will
be influenced by Justices
Kavanaugh and Gorsuch,
the two Trump-appointed
justices seen as conserva-
tive picks that shifted the
court to the ideological
right. Since the retirement
of swing vote Justice
Kennedy, the Court’s
opinion on LGBTQ+
rights has been especially
unclear; this case will
show how far the Court’s
opinion has shifted.
Whatever the result,

organization designated
by the Southern Poverty
Law Center as an an-
ti-LGBTQ+ hate group.
Rather, the three employ-
ers are arguing that it is
legal to dismiss people for
their sexuality or gender
identity for any reason.
The Court spent a
significant amount of
time discussing whether
a change in the interpre-
tation of the law to cover
cases will affect the lives
of millions of Americans,
whether or not they
identify as LGBTQ+. If
the Court finds in favor
of the employers, similar
arguments could be
made across a range of
other anti-discrimination
laws, opening the way to
LGBTQ+ persons losing
equal access to housing,
education, and sports
events. Furthermore, dis-
missal for not conforming
to gender stereotypes
would become legal,
allowing more forms of
sex discrimination, such
as penalizing men who
are the primary carers for
children, or women who
are the primary source
of income for a family.
However, if the em-
ployees’ complaints are
upheld, then LGBTQ+
people in 28 states would
gain certainty about
their legal position and
protection in employment
law, with more defined
protections in other areas
possibly following.
