T
o introduce
myself, I’m
Charlotte, a
struggling third
year physicist and infa-
mous napper, who would
like to call herself a fan of
film, but realistically falls
asleep midway through
every film she watches.
Don’t expect these short
reviews to be well writ-
ten; most of these films I
watched years ago and am
struggling to say anything
that isn’t incredibly gener-
ic, but I loved them and
that’s all that matters. An
honourable mention goes
to Bridget Jones’ Diary,
which I’ve watched a mil-
lion times, and took a lot
of strength for me not to
include in this list – take
from that what you want.
for not only Anderson, but
film in general and I have
since re-watched it many
times. I’m sure everyone
has heard of it, but if you
haven’t, I implore you
to watch this immensely
funny, superbly acted and
wonderfully attractive
film.
Dr. Strangelove or:
How I Learned to
Stop Worrying and
Love the Bomb
I just love this film.
I love it so much that
wherever I move, the first
decorative effort I make
mediate answer whenever
anyone asks what my
favourite film is, and if
someone ever asks what
I think the greatest film of
all time is, it’s probably
still the same response.
With Peter Sellers taking
three major roles under
his wing, including the
titular role, you can do
nothing but praise this
versatile actor three times
over. Wild from start to
finish and saturated with
some of the most absurd,
but genius, characters, this
cold war satire released in
1964 hasn’t really aged at
all and is still as hilarious
today.
Mustang
Mustang is the very
well regarded first feature
film of Turkish director
Deniz Gamze Ergüven.
The shortest way to
describe this film would
be to say think The Virgin
Suicides, but better.
The story follows five
orphaned young sisters
raised by their grand-
mother and abusive uncle
in a conservative Turkish
village. After being
caught playing with their
male classmates, they are
dragged out of school,
locked inside the house
and arranged to be married
off oldest to youngest. As
heart wrenching as it is
watching the childhoods
of these independent
young women being
snatched away, the film
is scattered with some
warm, sometimes even
funny, moments and I
finished this film feeling
incredibly touched.
The Before Trilogy
Comprised of Before
Sunrise (1995), Before
Sunset (2004) and Before
Midnight (2013), I guess
I’m cheating by putting
the entire trilogy on
my list, but in my mind
they’re not separate
(although if I had to pick
one, Before Sunset would
come out on top). Starring
Ethan Hawke as Jesse and
Julie Delpy as Celine, this
is a story of how a chance
and brief encounter per-
manently changed their
lives. Both characters are
so convincing and played
so seamlessly that by the
end of the trilogy, you feel
like you know them well,
despite the fact each film
is only set over the course
of a few hours, 9 years
apart. Lacking a central
storyline and focused
entirely on the continuous
conversation of these
characters, you would
think it would be easy
to get bored, yet I found
myself hanging onto
every word that was said.
Violently romantic, it will
make you want to fall in
love and have someone
fall in love with you.
Frances Ha
Frances Ha has to be
one of the most loveable
films I’ve ever seen.
With the wonderful and
naturally comedic Greta
Gerwig playing Frances,
a (not very good) dancer
with very little direction
but an admirable spirit
for life, this is the product
for a most endearing
main character. The film
is simple, highlighted
with its black and white
cinematography and not
an awful lot of plot, but
perfectly so. Watching
Frances struggle through
life in New York, it has
all the potential to be
desolate and depressing,
however with her positive
and bouncy personality
you find yourself laughing
along with her. I think it’s
fair to say that by the end
of it I wanted to see life a
little bit more like Frances,
but was also desperate for
a friend like her.

The Grand Budapest
Hotel
Initially I was torn on
placing a Wes Anderson
film in my top five, but
seeing as though he is a
large part of the reason I’m
interested in film today, it
only felt right.Admittedly,
this was a fight between
Rushmore, Moonrise

find the most hilarious,
Moonrise Kingdom
has the most sentiment
attached, but ultimately
The Grand Budapest

it ignited an instant love
