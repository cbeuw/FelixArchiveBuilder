O
n the 10th of
October, the
UK Commit-
tee on Climate
Change (CCC) delivered
a report to government
on how the government
can engage the public in
sustainable practices in
order to reduce carbon
emissions. The report
was led by Dr. Richard
Carmichael, an Imperial
academic working with
the Centre for Envi-
ronental Policy, after the
CCC appointed him to
the job.
The CCC is an inde-
pendent body established
under the Climate Act of
2008 in order to provide
advisement on future
policy and reporting on
current progress towards
emissions goals.
The report itself iden-
tifies multiple key areas
of attack, such as creating
new and compelling nar-
ratives to mobilise main-
stream participation, a
reduction in policy-based
obstaclestomarketchange
and consumer choice, and
the importance of data
and ICT in allowing con-
sumers to make informed
choices regarding technol-
ogy adoption (e.g. electric
cars). It contributed to the
CCC’s overall Net Zero
report to government.
The research of many
Imperial academics in this
direction stands in stark
contrast to the College’s
decisions regarding fossil
fuels. As previously re-
ported in Felix, Imperial
ranks 130th out of 154
UK universities on the
‘People&Planet’ league
charts for environmentally
ethical behaviour, and has
repeatedly stated that they
consider fossil fuel com-
panies to be partners in
the battle against climate
change.
This is in spite of the
recent Guardian report
that the top 20 fossil fuel
companies alone have
contributed to 35% of
all energy-related carbon
dioxide and methane
emissions worldwide
since 1965 – which is
when they became aware
of the future ramifica-
tions, after which they
later lobbied governments
to cover it up. Indeed, the
top four investor-owned
corporations (Chevron,
Exxon, BP, and Shell)
have contributed 10% on
their own. Topping that
chart is Chevron specifi-
cally, who have contribut-
ed 43.35 billion tonnes of
carbon dioxide.
The President of the
College, Alice Gast, sits
on the board of Chevron,
and receives a salary of
approximately £300,000
per year for doing so.
There is a dichotomy
between the excellent
work Imperial academics
do and the contradictory
perspective of senior
members of the College.
Even senior staff who
are very passionate about
the environment repeat
the ‘partners’rhetoric. In a
previous interview, the VP
of Advancement Michael
Murphy – who previ-
ously worked with Kew
Gardens – also stated that
“we have to work with
industry – industry has
to be at the table. I don’t
see how we address bio-
diversity loss and climate
change if we don’t have
the major players there.”
There is increasing
pressure on the College
to consider divestment,
as Imperial-based activist
groups have begun to flyer
and protest at energy- or
fossil-fuel based events
such as the Glencore ‘In-
troduction to Oil Trading’
event by the IC Energy
Society on Wednesday
16th.
The Fossil Fuel Dichotomy at Imperial
Felix is committed this year to demystifying the Union for students, shedding light on the processes and people
behind decision-making - this week, we summarise the juicy bits of the first meeting of the Union Council
“Chevron have
contributed
43.35 billion
tonnes of
carbon
dioxide”
