SPORTS
T
he 1st XV cam-
paign of 2019
started with an
away game to
KCL. The crisp weather
seemed to reflect the
nerves amongst the fresh-
ers, while the autumnal
sunshine mirrored the ex-
citement within the team.
The first 10 minutes saw
Imperial forwards attack-
ing the try line with pick
and gos. After a series of
relentless phases, their ef-
forts were not rewarded as
the referee (who seemed
to not be on form that day)
claimed the ball was held
up. Moments after, from a
turnover, Amin’s piercing
ball to Duffy, on the verge
of being intercepted, saw
him get the opening 5
points as he went on to
beat 3 other defenders.
Early in the second
half, the dominant KCL
scrum near the Imperial
try line led to the number
8 walking the ball over;
7-5 KCL.
A dispirited drizzle
ensued and Imperial
were down to 10 men.
Shortly after, with the
disappearance of the rain,
a small pop pass, as if the
ball were a pea popping
out of its pod, from Dan
Kirrane to Oliver Duffy
in the middle of the pitch
saw Duffy score his
second for the day; 7-12
Imperial. The boys fought
for another try to put
away the game. Lustreless
phases of unimaginative
KCL attack was met with
a web-like defensive
structure the team had
worked hard on; both the
line speed and the aggres-
sion in the tackles proved
to be too much for KCL
as they struggled to keep
possession. In the blink of
an eye, Dan Kirrane was
off and running for the try
line as he scooped up the
ball rolling out of a ruck
going on to side step the
back three; 7-19 Imperial.
With minutes left, KCL
were unable to get back
in the game. In the end,
moments of brilliance
from the Imperial backs
and a gallant defensive
effort from the forwards
were enough to get the
first win of the season. In
particular, the accuracy of
the 5 lineout maestros in
catching darts from Toby
Daniels must commend-
ed.
V
alerio fielded
an experienced
XV to face
Medway, with
just three freshers making
the cut and multiple fa-
miliar faces returning to
the side after last years’
sabbatical. We knew
we were in for a tough
game against last years’
league winners, who beat
us both home and away
last season. They were
considerably bigger than
us, but we knew that if we
applied the structure that
we’d been working on in
Monday evening sessions,
we had the potential to
tear them apart.
Rudman took the
kick off well and carried
hard, setting up a strong
platform for George
Morgan to box kick.
Relentless defence from
the home side followed,
putting Medway on the
back foot. After a turnover
from Charles Courou-
geux, sustained attack
meant the visitors even-
tually lost their discipline,
enabling Thornton to go
quickly and score the first
five points of the match.

their strength lied; the
pick-and-go. They suc-
cessfully did this from
their own 22 to score their
first points of the match.
The conversion meant the
score was 10-7 in favour
of the home side.
With less than 10
minutes to go and Im-
perials defence proving
impenetrable, Medway
knew that they had to try
and be a bit more creative.
This resulted in them
attempting to go wide, but
Charles’ intuition meant
he read the play perfectly,
intercepting a wide pass
and running in for Impe-
rial’s third try.
With the game seem-
ingly over, Imperial were
hungry to chase that fourth
try to secure a bonus point
which may prove vital
in their title contention.
With Marco and Shuya
on the pitch, you’re never
lacking in flair, and this is
exactly what was required
when they combined with
fresher Peter to see Marco
score under the posts,
converted by Valerio.
The 2nd XV have a lot
to be proud of after that
performance against a
strong Medway side and
it’s looking good for the
rest of the season. Nev-
ertheless there’s a lot to
work on as we should’ve
shut them out in the first
half.
Special shout-out to
Brzosko for filling in at
prop after Matias flaked
because he can’t hack a
hangover.
P.S. Apologies if this
is incorrect, I banged my
head mid-game so my
memory may not be too
reliable.

torn.
“With less than
10 minutes to
go, Imperial’s
defence
proved
impenetrable”
Dictated by Valerio,
imperial stuck to their
game plan well, with
a series of ‘munsters’
drawing in and tiring the
big Medway pack. When
it was time to strike, a
well-executed back’s
move saw Rohit cross
over in the corner on his
return to the 2nd XV to
leave the score at 10-0 at
half time.
Imperial had lots of
territory in the first half
and felt disappointed
not to have turned it into
more points. Cal deemed
it necessary to look to
the fresher-filled bench
for inspiration, with Peter
Hyde, Elliott Stoclet,
Jack Polturak and Freddie
Sligo coming on to make
their 2XV debuts.
A stalemate followed
for the majority of the
second half, before
Medway realised where
