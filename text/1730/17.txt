ASoviet still life in eight chapters - Theatre of Nations
T
he themes of
the stories are
centred mostly
on the everyday
aspects of social life.
The characters are not
extraordinary in their
feats of achievement but
shine through with their
touching realness. When
the curtains part, a bench
is revealed, which takes
up most of the stage, and
will throughout serve
as several metaphorical
spaces, testing the ability
of actors to convince us
of their characters. This
they do brilliantly. Behind
the bench are three large
picture panels. In the
the first play they show
beautiful sunflowers in
summer sunshine, while
in the last the flowers
appear withered. These
panels, along with the
costumes, are the only
visual context given to the
stories. These are mostly
concerned with life in the
countryside or at the inter-
section of rural and urban
life – and the associated
challenges common to this
juxtaposition characteris-
tic of newly industrialized
nations.
The first story is
opened by the narration
of two cheery but blunt
village ladies, sitting
on one corner of the
humongous bench and
shedding sunflower seeds
all over the floor. Their
demeanour and tone give
the immediate impression
of a gossiping babushka,
all too known to me as a
fellow Slav from a small
town. The wholesome
story gives a glimpse
of the cyclical nature of
life especially evident in
slow-paced rural areas,
and comments on the
illusive nature of the
generation gap. As a son
asks his father for help
in the courtship of a love
interest the awkwardness
is palpable, the acting
brilliant, and there are the
constant shouts of advice
from a grandad drunk off
vodka. How lovely!
While some stories are
quite placid, others have
more of an agenda. The
second half of the three-
hour performance kicked
off with a story of a man
madly in love getting his
heart broken by a wife that
everyone else had seen for
a twisted seductress. It
raises the question of the
point of disillusionment,
and answers it with the
protagonist’s declaration
to the effect of: “This is a
mighty hangover… But it
was a hell of a party.”
There is another story
of a man of country blood
marrying a Muscovite,
going through a turbulent
sequence of moments of
infectious love-happiness
and utter despair, before
losing his mind, threat-
ening to kill his wife,
and finally committing
suicide. It is a Russian
specialty to drive chinks
in characters’ psyches
from utter banality to the
rawest human emotions,
and Shukshin does it
brilliantly.
My favourite one,
though, is of the blind
accordion player, who
only sang sad songs. With
the advent of broadcasting
technology, the city noises
began to drown him out,
and the state eventually
offered him a pension
in order to stop him
bumming everyone out
with his singing. When at
the end, a possible con-
clusion is offered by some
teenagers wanting to
archive old folk songs and
grant him new purpose,
it is snatched away by
the sad fact that all the
songs the man can sing
had already long been
recorded and archived. It
is a comment on the role
of the artist, his need for
an audience, and how
technology, a totalitarian
regime’s strong hand, and
most importantly, time,
can all combine to make
his art irrelevant. But,
as Bulgakov said, man-
uscripts don’t burn, and
the touching stories of
Shukshin continue to hold
great power even today.
Live it up with the Modernist’s at Barbican’s new show
I
n contrast to last
year’s wildly popular
Modern Couples,
which offered an
intimate view into how in-
terpersonal relationships
of artists shaped their
work, this offers a differ-
ent view. It portrays some
of the most influential
artists of modernism as
entertainers: uproarious
and devilish founders of
the most vibrant creative
spaces of their time.
The exhibit is divided
geographically, and each
room shows off a differ-
ent city’s cabaret scene. It
starts off with the Fleder-
maus in Vienna. The level
of detail shown by both
the curators of the exhib-
it and the original cabaret
founders is breath-taking.
You can observe the men-
us and napkins, chairs and
tables, wall tapestries and
carpets – all of them care-
fully designed to create a
holistic space. The main
room is one of the four
cabaret spaces recreated
for this exhibition, allow-
ing us to immerse in it and
even touch the tiles adorn-
ing the walls. The en-
chanting room, converted
from the basement of a
residential building by the
addition of a mosaic of
coloured tiles and a mir-
ror-topped bar, was unfor-
tunately only in operation
for six years due to cost-
ing so much money. De-
spite this, the presence of
a drawing of the room by
a young Charles-Edouard
Jeanneret, apparently the
only drawing of Viennese
architecture that the future
Le Corbusier would ever
make, is a testament to its
influence.
Boundary-pushing
happenings, dance per-
formances, shadow plays,
early cinema and dances
mingled in their nascency
in all these spaces. This ef-
fort to provide all kinds of
sensory experience is why
it is hard to compare these
original night-dwellings
of the avant-garde to the
spawns of the multibil-
lion-pound clubbing in-
dustry today. The clubs of
the past were much more
spaces of creative prolif-
eration than hedonism,
although both aspects can
be observed in the evi-
dence put forth by the ex-
hibition. It is also true that
these places, beginning
with the first of them all,
Paris’s Le Chat Noir, were
mostly frequented by the
artistic elite. The insuffi-
ciency of such clientele
could explain their short
lifespans and the quickly
changing fads, a problem
even for the clubs of to-
day.
The biggest feat of this
exhibit is the way it un-
wittingly takes you on a
journey through the most
important artistic move-
ments of the time. We are
inspired by the most well-
known, as well as some
lesser known cabarets and
clubs Both places where
design was king and where
the people were the soul.
We pass by the Italian Fu-
turists, and their Cabaret
del Diavolo, where three
rooms were inspired by
heaven, purgatory, and
hell of Dante’s Divine
Comedy. Representing
De Stijl is the mecca of
geometric abstractionism
in Strasbourg’s L’Aubette.
The birthplace of Dada
in Zurich’s Cabaret Vol-
taire and the speakeasies
of Harlem are flanked by
Nigerian Ibadan & Osog-
bo Mbari clubs and Teh-
ran’s Rasht. The quote
by Nigerian artist Twins
Seven-Seven sums it up
nicely: “We worked furi-
ously (…) slept little and
lived for the daily surpris-
es… For such a euphoric
situation to develop the
time, the place and the
human chemistry need to
be right!”
