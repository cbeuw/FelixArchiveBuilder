JOHN is out here (on the fringes)
J
OHN, often
known as JOHN
(TIMESTWO) as
both members of the
duo are called John, have
a brand spanking new
album out. And as unim-
aginative as their band
name is, this album is
far from the same. Based
out of Crystal Palace,
South London, JOHN
rode into the current
post-punk wave along
with the likes of Idles and
Fontaines DC with guitars
a-blazing, their sound
a firm contrast to their
Weezer-inspired indie
look. Their first album,
God Speed in the National
Limit, was released in
2017 to rave reviews
and led to supporting the
aforementioned Idles on
their European tour. Their
latest release, Out Here
on the Fringes, is sure to
follow suit, being named
the BBC’s album of the
day last week and having
had shout-outs from the
crème-de-la-crème of
rock including his majesty
Iggy Pop. They seem to
be onto something here. It
all kicks off with jostling
drums and guitar on the
first single and album
opener ‘Future Thinker’
before singer/drummer
John Newton’s enticing
growls enter. This track
sets the tone for the rest
of the record: its hyper,
demanding nature is
sweat-inducing as you feel
Johns restrain themselves
for long enough to feel the
circle-pit opening before
everything crashes in. My
personal favourites, ‘High
Digger’ and ‘Dog Walker’
then kick in with riffs so
repetitive and addictive
that I wonder how I lived
until now without them.
The album wraps up with
mysterious ‘Midnight
Supermarket’ creeping
into hard-hitting ‘Solid
State’, two songs which
transport you first to aisle
3 at witching hour and
secondly to contemplating
your own consistency,
with lyrics such as “is it
true, am I a solid state?”.
Perhaps unsure about that,
but I can guarantee JOHN
are consistently hitting
the post-punk scene with
some solid tunes.

yourself transported to a
hot, crowded venue whilst
listening. The next track
‘Standard Hauntings’ is
no different. Three songs
in and you’re allowed
a small break on the
opening of the title-track
‘Out Here on the Fringes’:
sliding guitars make way
for heavy noise, with
guitarist Johnny Healey
intertwining punchy riffs
with swooning feedback.
