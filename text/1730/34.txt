Riot Games is Trying to Kill Blizzard: the 10th
Annive
Riot’s 10th
anniversary special broadcast saw a wild
amount of announcements - both to do with their
flagship (and to date only) game, League of Legends, as
well as myriad new game announcements. Felix Games
gives the run-down, as well as speculates on what this
signals in terms of Riot’s business plan going forward

working on
new netcode
technology to
reduce ping
and latency
issues”
T
he 10th-anniver-
sary celebration
of League of
Legends took
place a few days ago –
and oh boy, did Riot pull
out all the stops.
The day began with
some fun streams with
various Riot employees –
such as a live concert of
League music, a ‘Twitch
Plays’, where the chat
was used to drive a robot
around Riot HQ, and (my
personal favourite) an
artist stream: where quick
concept art was made for
a variety of meme-worthy
skin ideas. KDA Gragas
was a particular highlight.
However, the real show
began with a special
episode of ‘Riot Pls’, the
studio’s version of a video
dev blog. We at Felix
Games are going to break
down the changes they
announced for League –
as well as the incredibly
spicy news they shared
about finally putting the
‘s’ in Riot ‘Games’.
First, pre-season
changes. They’ve themat-
ically dubbed the changes
“Rise of the Elements”.
We’ll be diving into these
in detail soon as more
information is revealed,
but in short: welcome to
RNG city. The random-
ly-spawning elemental
dragons (drakes) will now
cause permanent changes
to the map depending
on which drake spawns
third – such as destroying
or building walls (laughs
in Qiyana) or adding
extra brushes to the map
(laughs in Rengar). Drake
effects have been tweaked
too, especially the Elder
Dragon, which now no
longer amplifies the
effects of previously-tak-
en drakes but instead
offers execution below a
certain health threshold.
They’ve given everybody
Pyke ultimate on every
damaging ability – dear
lord, it’s the end of days.
Additionally, they’ve
added extra brushes to the
jungle and small ‘alcoves’
to the sidelanes – time for
the rise of Shaco support
– as well as a slew of item
and XP tweaks. Lastly,
they revealed a teaser
for a new marksman
support champion: Senna,
Lucian’s wife, whose soul
was previously trapped in
Thresh’s lantern. Fun fact:
Thresh used to start with
one soul stacked already
wheneverhefacedLucian,
which presumably will
have to change.
Lastly: yes, the rumours
were true. League is going
to console and mobile
with a revamped set of
mechanics and models
that were built from the
ground-up, as is TFT. This
is reassuring for mobile
game or console enthusi-
asts – after all, a pure port
of a MOBA like League
just wouldn’t work.
The visuals of this new
version, dubbed ‘Wild
Rift’, look particularly
impressive, with some
pretty awesome character
animations that seem to
play as an introduction
(possibly in champ select)
– but whether it feels good
to play will have to be
seen.
Oh – and classic
URF is coming back
for a couple of weeks.
Karthus-induced carpal
tunnel (which I’m
dubbing Karthpal tunnel)
incoming. TFT is also
getting a new seasonal set
of champions, essentially
hitting reset on the meta
and starting from the
beginning!
Now – and I can’t
believe I’m saying this –
that’s the ‘boring’ news
out of the way. What a
world we live in when
those changes are the
vanilla ones. Let’s dig into
the plethora of new games
Riot has just announced!
‘Project L’:
The Fighting Game
Riot announced that
they were working on a
fighting game at EVO this
year after the information
had previously been
leaked, having acquired
the development team
who were working on the
highly-anticipated and
then cancelled ‘Rising
Thunder’ game three
years ago. However, this
is the first time early
development gameplay
has been shown – and it
looks incredibly slick.
The game will feature
characters from Runeterra
and League, with Darius,
Jinx, Ahri, and Katarina
being seen duking it out
in the preview. Sadly, the
announcement came with
a caveat: there won’t be
any more information
for a while. It’s exciting
nonetheless.
One thing that fighting
game enthusiasts will be
excited to hear is that Riot
is working on some form
of new netcode technol-
ogy aimed at reducing
the impact of latency and
ping on gameplay – which
was officially announced
as part of the next game
on our list.
