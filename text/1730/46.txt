A Spotlight on: the Imperial University Challenge

Michael Kohn
QuizSoc Secretary
Michael: So, what
is University Chal-
lenge?
CM: It’s a quiz show,
spanning lots of subjects,
mainly academic, that gets
shown on TV fromAugust
to April on Mondays on
BBC2. I think that it’s
one of the oldest and most
enduring quiz shows out
there. Unlike other shows,
it’s only students, in a
team of four, representing
their university, compet-
ing against other students
from other universities.
It’s a buzzer race against
the other team for a no-
torious “Starter for Ten”
followed by three bonuses
as a team, a format that
sets it apart from The
Chase, Mastermind, and
other quiz shows. Roger
Tilling’s voice saying
things is also notorious
- there’s a weird cult fol-
lowing around the show
for sure, and it’s even had
a film based on it.
What was the experi-
ence like, under the
cameras and under
fire from Jeremy Pax-
man, the host?
CM: You kind of forget
about the cameras after
five minutes, and then
it becomes like another
quiz. You do see the
close-up camera on your
face turn on and you think
“God what does my face
look like, better not do
something stupid” but
then you get into a rhythm
of it. It was just a fantastic
experience, and everyone
should try out for it.
Jeremy Paxman is a lovely
man; we got to meet him a
bit outside of filming and
he’s definitely very nice. I
think people like to think
of those clips from the
show where he acts like
something very obscure
is obvious, but when you
get talking to him he’s
definitely a really nice
guy. So is Roger Tilling
for that matter, such an
odd experience to put a
face to that voice.
What were the trials
like and how are you
running them this
year?
CM:Trials were fine. Most
universities have a very
similar selection process
with a handwritten test
and then a buzzer round.
I’d done buzzer quizzes
before but University
Challenge is special and a
different flavour so it was
nice to get a shot at what it
was like.
We’re going to hold
round 1 trials of reading
out many questions with
people writing down the
answers to see who knows
what, before inviting back
people who score well and
have a good knowledge
base for a buzzer practice
in various teams before
combining four people
and one reserve to make
the team; it’s not necessar-
ily the four highest scores
but the team with the best
subject spread, so if you
think your skills like in
a particular niche even if
you don’t think you may
be one of the four best
you might find yourself
on the team and off to
play against Manchester,
Edinburgh, UCL, and
Oxbridge!
How did you train as
a team?
CM: “Train” is a very
strong word - at the end
of it you have got to love
spending a lot of time on
Wikipedia or elsewhere
just generally reading
about things other people
may find silly, so it’s
mainly people with really
strong and general inter-
ests that do really well
on the show. We’d meet
weekly and watch the
episodes of the last series
when they aired with
buzzers to play against
the two teams. We did
also have a think about
what weaknesses we had
as a collective group, and
tried to brush up on those
subjects too.
What advice would
you have for people
who really want to be
on the show?
CM: Have fun with it; you
can work really hard and
write notes, and sure it can
help a bit, but at the end of
the day the people who do
well and get on the show
just love learning and
reading things and enjoy
it, getting into Wikipedia
holes - that has to be
something that sounds
appealing to you to be a
really good contestant.
Also come to trials (you
can’t get on the show
otherwise) and the Buzzer
Practices that QuizSoc
run to improve that speed-
based side of things!
Catch Conor and the
rest of their team’s episode
as it airs at 8.30pm on
Monday 21st October –
it will be screened at a
special event in FiveSix-
Eight!
Round 1 of Trials will
be held on 30th and 31st
October at South Kens-
ington Campus (location
TBC). There will also be
a separate Round 1 Trial
at St Mary’s campus on
4th November. Round 2
trials will then take place
later that week – check
the Imperial Quiz Society
facebook page for further
details when confirmed!
Quizsoc run buzzer
practices from 6-8pm
every Thursday, and
compete in various
non-university-challenge
tournaments throughout
the year, with one in
particular on the 9th
November that Imperial
is hosting, which is the
British Novice tourna-
ment, ideal for anyone
starting out on a quizzing
journey or who hasn’t
done this type of thing
before! We will also be
running a Harry Potter
Pub Quiz and another
themed pub quiz during
this term. Email quiz@
ic.ac.uk to find out more
– spaces for the tourna-
ments are going fast!
