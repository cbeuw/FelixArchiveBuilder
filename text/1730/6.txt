P
rotests in Hong
Kong have been
in the news
for almost 4
months. Initially the
protests were targeted to
stop the extradition law
to pass. I am sure that
many are confused why
a seemingly common
extradition law caused
full-scale riots and
protests. The proposed
extradition law included
an extradition agreement
with China. Hong Kong
has a completely differ-
ent law system as it was
a British colony until
1997. Most of the laws
are British laws and the
rule of law has been
respected for years. In
contrast, China’s law
system is widely consid-
ered to be a political tool
for the Communist Party.
Hong Kong people fear
that fugitives (fugitive
from China’s point
of view can be very
different from ours!)
sent back to China will
receive unfair treatment.
That’s what made nearly
1 million people take
to the streets on 9 June
which is roughly 1/8 of
the population of Hong
Kong.
The government
remained unmoved and
announced that it would
continue its work on
passing the law. This in-
furiated the people and
inspired some to start
protesting violently. As
protests started to get
violent, clashes between
the police and protestors
became more intense.
On 21 July 2019, a
mob of around hundred
armed men attacked
civilians, who were
mostly pro-democracy
protesters, at Yuen Long
Station. Later it was
found that police had
turned a blind eye to
the attack and the police
force was accused of
collusion with the mob.
This sparked more
violent protests, and
this is when the protest
shifted its focus from
anti-extradition to anti
police. On several oc-
casions, the police force
showed a completely
biased attitude towards
the pro-government side
and this included setting
an armed pro-govern-
ment protestor free
after they assaulted the
opposition.
P r o - d e m o c r a c y
protestors are called
cockroaches by their
opposition. Indeed, they
have showed the resil-
ience of cockroaches. In
a recent report, around
40 percent of arrested
protestors in the last 4
months are aged under
18. These young pas-
sionate protestors and
their pursuit of freedom
and western values will
pose a great threat to the
government in the long
term. I personally can’t
see this clash ending
without both the protes-
tors and the government
taking a back step. It
seems impossible that
the government is going
to meet the 5 demands
proposed by protestors
which include universal
suffrage for the election
of the chief execu-
tive and releasing all
prosecuted protestors.
Meeting some of these
demands will complete-
ly undermine the values
of the Communist
Party and potentially
cause local uprising in
mainland China.
However, there is one
demand that is worth
mentioning which is to
set up an independent
committee investigating
the misconduct of police
during the protests. I
am very confident that
protests would die down
after this demand has
been met. However if
the government insists
on ignoring the demands
of the people, this will
be the start of a series
of even more violent
protests and potentially
trigger an emigration
crisis.
With Hong Kong
being sandwiched
between the West and
China, the freedoms
that all Hong Kong
citizens celebrate and
thrive under are getting
tightened gradually by
Beijing. Fueled with ri-

diculous property prices
and income inequality,
the anti-extradition
protests seem inevitable
in retrospect.
The protest has
inspired many to take
side in either pro-de-
mocracy or pro-govern-
ment. From what I see,
the difference in polit-
ical stance has caused
tensions between friends
and family. Many feared
to express their opinions
while some openly crit-
icize others’ opinion on
social media. Perhaps
we should start respect-
ing each other’s opinion
and try to talk our way
through these. I never
love writing, not even
in Chinese, but I could
really feel the drive to
write about Hong Kong,
the only place that I
could call home.
