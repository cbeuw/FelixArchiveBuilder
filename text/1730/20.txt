W

swiftly un-
derway, I’m
sure many of you will be
unsure what to do with all
this free time you have. To
ease your concern we’ve
created our lists of top 5
films with a little bit of
something for everyone.
First, cutting our fa-
vourite films down to a list
of five is difficult. As in
Sophie’s Choice difficult.
(Although, spoiler, this
film will not be making an
appearance). Some films
that are close to our hearts
haven’t made it into this
spread, and if given the
space, I’m almost certain
we could fill The Felix
entirely, but that would be
a little too self-indulgent.
We’d also like to add that
there is a big difference
between our favourite
films, and what we think
is a good film; if we were
to make a list of what
we believe are the 5 best
films ever made, I don’t
think there would be too
much similarity between
these. With this sweeping
disclaimer as to avoid
any angry emails from
students professing their
love for Citizen Kane and
Vertigo, let’s get into our
favourite 5’s.
To begin I’ll say a bit
about myself; I’m a third-
year physics student and
spend most of my time
between Blackett and the
BFI. You can probably
catch me napping in the
JCR between bouts of
restless frustration for
labs, and if you ever see
me about campus, I’m
always more than happy
to talk anything film. Now
onto the good stuff.
Tokyo Story
Without a doubt one
of the most honest and
heart-wrenching portray-
als of a family that has
ever existed on screen,
Tokyo Story has stood for
over 65 years as a pillar
in Japanese film making.
Following two grand-
parents as they travel
to Tokyo to visit their
disconnected children
who’ve grown distant
over the years, we’re
unapologetically taken
through their time in the
city. Yasujirō Ozu gives
us a master class in sto-
rytelling, which through
his minimalistic approach
to shooting, we’re left
with the bare bones of the
dialogue with the actors
taking the centre stage.
Where a lesser film would
have played heavily on
our sentimental triggers
creating melodrama,
Tokyo Story instead gives
us a sincere and honest
film that lets the weight
of the character’s actions
hang heavily over the
viewer. It’ll make you
reconsider your family
values and, in the process,
leave you weeping, this
emotional feature had to
make it onto my list
Rushmore
Rushmore is just a film
that hits all the right notes
for me; it’s brilliantly
written, quietly funny,
and with a soundtrack
to please even the Music
still carefully crafted,
it’s a little more rugged
around the edges than the
likes of Grand Budapest
and Moonrise, and with
the perfectly imperfect
Schwartzman and Murray
leading the cast, I’ll be the
first student enrolling at
Rushmore next year.
Lady Bird
It would have been
difficult to make to the
end of 2017 without
having had Lady Bird
mentioned to you, along
with the eminent buzz
around Greta Gerwig. For
her solo directorial debut,
Gerwig tells the coming-
of-age story of Christine
McPherson (Saoirse
Ronan) growing up in
Sacramento, and follows
the uneven relationship
with her mother (Laurie
Metcalf). The centrepiece
of this film for me are
the highly observant
and expertly written
interactions between the
people, creating one of
the most heart-warming
and poignant films of
the 21st century. With a
powerhouse performance
from Metcalf mixed with
an eclectic score (that car
scene bowls me over every
time) and not to mention
the final scene (which is
one of the most touching
and accurate portrayals of
nostalgia I’ve ever seen)
this is a film that sits close
to my heart.
Midnight in Paris
Now I know Woody
Allen has a plethora of
films to choose from;
Annie Hall, Love and
Death,Manhattantoname
a few, but none of these
films quite grip me like
Midnight in Paris. With
Owen Wilson roaming
the streets of 1920’s Paris,
doing his best Woody
Allen impression, I can’t
help but get lost in the
same world that he finds
himself in every night.
Taken from Hemingway’s
A Moveable Feast, the
fairy tale portion of this
story lends itself to bril-
liant writing (as can be
expected of Allen) with
the likes of Fitzgerald
and Stein being brought
back to life. This fairy tale
world makes me long for
a time I never knew, and a
place I’ve never been, and
for that it will always be
one of my favourite films.
Birdman or (The
Unexpected Virtue of
Ignorance)
Alejandro Gonzalez
Iñárritu knows how to
make a film. His vision
for a feature made to
look as though it’s in
one take is flawlessly
executed and exceedingly
immersive, whilst still
grounding itself with an
outstanding story. With
the lack of many (visible)
cuts I can only find myself
holding onto every word
of every scene as we’re
submerged into the world
of washed-out actor
Riggan Thomson, along
with the inner monologue
of his darkest thoughts
inhabited by Birdman.
With a jazz drum-based
original soundtrack, we’re
forced into this feeling
of constant movement,
giving rise to a building
and climactic end to the
film that left me exhila-
rated yet satisfied after 2
hours of this deeply dark
satire.

Editors, it’s my Rushmore.
Wes Anderson’s second
feature follows eccentric
student Max (Jason
Schwartzman) through a
year in Rushmore School,
mixing a blend of wit,
drama, and romance to
emerge as (what I believe)
is Anderson’s best. If
you’ve seen even one of
Anderson’s films, you’ll
be starkly aware of the
attention to detail he
takes for the aesthetics
of a scene, yet Rushmore
comes a whisker before
he developed his sug-
ary-sweet style. Whilst
