I
f you’re not totally
up to speed with the
situation in which
Ecuador currently
finds itself, I think I can
find it in my heart to
forgive you – in a world
which seems to be in a
hurry to fall into crisis
of late, it can be terribly
hard to keep up with it all.
In any case, let me lay it
down for you: On October
1st, Ecuador’s president
Lenín Moreno announced
a new IMF-supported
austerity package to
combat the country’s
rising debt and to qualify
for an emergency loan of
$4.2bn. One particularly
controversial aspect of
the deal was the repealing
of some 40-year-old fuel
subsidies, which saw the
price of diesel double
overnight. In response,
labour unions and in-
digenous groups took to
the streets to demand the
subsidies’ reinstatement –
initially, Moreno refused
to budge, and so the pro-
tests became increasingly
violent, culminating in
hostage-taking of police
officers, the deaths of
at least 8 people, and
evacuation of the national
government from Quito
to the coastal city of
Guayaquil. After 2 weeks
of continuous unrest and
eventual talks, Moreno
finally agreed to reinstate
the subsidies. A victory
for the people, then – but
what lurks beneath the
surface?
Moreno had been right
to be nervous: over the
past 30 years, indige-
nous-led groups have been
responsible for the ousting
of several presidents.
Despite this, the govern-
ment maintained that the
package was necessary to
make up for years of over-
spending by the previous
government of Rafael
Correa. They said that the
subsidies were costing the
nation a cool $1.4bn per
year, a sum which had
become unaffordable. For
CONAIE (Confederation
of Indigenous Nationali-
ties of Ecuador) however,
this wasn’t good enough.
the doubling of fuel costs
impacts disadvantaged
people massively.
All of this points to
a substantial failing of
left-wing Latin American
politics. Native peoples
have for years struggled
under the yoke of global
neoliberalism; their lands
are frequently occupied
by multinational corpora-
tions and their traditional
societies are disrupted by
an uncaring global order.
For the approximately 3
million indigenous Ecua-
doreans, this means being
4.5 times more likely to
be impoverished. Native
children only stay in
school on average for half
as long as their coloni-
al-descended classmates.
And yet despite this
obvious systemic disad-
vantage, many left-wing
populists of the Latin
American “pink tide”
have been unable to ade-
quately deal with it. Take
Correa: over the course of
his 10-year premiership,
his government used state
oil revenues to increase
spending on health,
education and social
programs, and as a result
“A substantial
failing of left-
wing Latin
American
politics”
Ecuador saw a large drop
in poverty and inequality,
among other encouraging
development indicators.
However, his administra-
tion oversaw intense de-
velopment and exploita-
tion of natural resources
and native lands, often on
behalf of overseas com-

panies. In late 2016, the
lands of the Shuar people
in the Amazon were liter-
ally invaded and occupied
by the state military
in response to their
opposition to massive
hydroelectric and mining
developments by Chinese
and Canadian firms. The
local autonomous gov-
ernment was arbitrarily
detained, and when the
locals attempted to resist,
the army were granted
exceptional powers to put
them down.
The response from
supporters of Correa’s
approach will say that the
development provided
over a billion dollars in
income for the govern-
ment annually, money
which was then reinvested
into the country for the
benefit of all. But much
of this reinvestment was
only skin deep, and failed
to properly address the
deeper structural roots
of inequality in Ecuador,
which come as the product
of decades of colonial and
post-colonial historical
development – a develop-
ment whose characteris-
tics are specifically Latin,
and whose antagonisms
are rooted in the tension
between the European
and the Indigenous. This
failure is evident in the
over-reliance of Correa’s
economic plans on global
commodity prices, most
particularly oil. His
volatile, populist leftism,
while impressive in the
short term, can never truly
reconcile the inequalities
of Ecuador because it
relies too inherently on
European notions of indi-
vidualism, which stand in
stark contrast to traditional
native ways of life. For the
Latin American left, then,
a new way of thinking is
needed, and seeds of it
can be found in the works
of the Peruvian thinker
Jose Carlos Mariátegui.
In the early 20th Century,
Mariátegui saw that
applying European ideas
about leftism to South
America was foolish, both
since the continents had
undergone such different
developments through
history, and since the
germs of socialist society
pre-existed in many
indigenous peoples of the
region. This is the kind of
radical thinking necessary
for the reinvigoration of
the Latin leftist project -
one needs only to look to
the Zapatistas of Chiapas
to see the successes it
can produce. It’s also one
that’s particularly relevant
considering the current
climate crisis: in the words
of the Peruvian indige-
nous leader Hugo Blanco,
“We Indians, we’ve been
practicing ecosocialism
for five centuries now”.
“The deeper
structural roots
of inequality...
the product
of decades of
colonial and
post-colonial
historical
development”
With all this in mind,
we can understand
the current protests in
Ecuador as but one facet
of a long struggle between
indigenous and colonial
thought in Latin America.
Though the current
protests have ended, the
underlying tension isn’t
going anywhere. Moreno
must understand this
better than his predeces-
sors if he is to truly move
Ecuador forwards.
