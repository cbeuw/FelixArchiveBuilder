POV:Ah, the glory days before dawn of the blue shell!
O
n my way
back home
this weekend
I was strolling
past a CeX (Computer
Exchange) shop when I
caught a glimpse of some-
thing in the corner of my
eye. For the decent price
of £25, I happened upon a
fully complete in box ver-
sion of Super Mario Kart
for the Super Nintendo
Entertainment System.
Given my love for retro
games and that this was
the last Mario Kart game
I needed to complete my
collection: I knew I had to
make the purchase.
After thoroughly
cleaning the cartridge, I
popped it into my SNES
and started up the game.
As is true with all retro
games, I was able to jump
straight into the action: 1
player, 100cc, Mushroom
Cup. I chose Donkey
Kong Jr. (a character we
don’t often see nowadays)
and got to racing. The first
thing I noticed was how
strange the track looked.
Old 16-bit systems did not
have the power to run full
3-D games, polygons and
all,soinsteadtheycleverly
designed 2-D images to
look 3-D (similar to the
original DOOM). This
was very clear in the
way that various barriers
looked completely flat and
how objects such as pipes
and thwomps seemed to
slowly creep towards you
in increments of frames
rather than smoothly
increase in size as you get
closer.
Other than the look
of the track, the driving
was initially jarring too.
Coming from playing a lot
of Mario Kart 8, getting
used to this older drifting
system was quite the chal-
lenge. There are no boosts
from drifting and your
drift is not held if you
press the other direction;
instead you just fling off
to side, frequently going
off-road and losing a lot
of speed. This meant that
I had to work hard at mas-
tering the use of hopping
back into a straight
position after a turn.
The soundtrack is
where this game truly
shines! Each type of
track (e.g. Mario Circuit,
Bowser’s Castle e.t.c.)
has its own song. The
soundtrack absolutely
bops and remains a classic
to this day. While I am
writing this article the
title theme is playing in
the background, (much to
the dismay of my fellow
editors)!
With all its positives,
Super Mario Kart clearly
shows a lack of polish the
more recent iterations in
the franchise have been
blessed with. Spinning out
after hitting an obstacle
can be very disorientating,
people prone to motion
sickness beware! Not only
that but when you get hit
by an obstacle or fall off
the stage, it takes so long
to recover that your race
is basically over. With
all of that said I still had
an amazing time with
the game. I don’t think
that I have played for
long enough to consider
myself any good at it but
I am definitely going to
play more so that I can
improve. I imagine the
2-player mode is very
hectic; sadly I haven’t
found anyone willing to
play it with me yet!
I hope everyone has
had a great week and be
sure to check out some
games coming out this
month!
POV: Ratchet and Clank 2016 ... just ... just why?
H
aving just fin-
ished Ratchet
and Clank 2016
in its entirety I
have to say: considering
the great reviews, I’m
not actually convinced
reviewers were playing
the same game. Before I
start the inevitable ensu-
ing rant, I would like to
say that the series holds a
special place in my heart.
I got into it when I was 9
years old and have been
a follower ever since;
the start to my R&C
journey began with Tools
of Destruction and then
followed chronologically
until Crack in Time, when
I retroactively began
playing the earlier games
after the HD collection
was released (most of
which I have platinumed).
Here’s my hot take:
having played majority
of the past games, I can
honestly tell you that R&C
2016 is an utterly soulless
remaster of the original.
I will not contest that it’s
a visual masterpiece akin
to an ultra-high definition
Pixar game – but the mag-
ic of the earlier games just
isn’t there. The game has
been stripped of its char-
acter, presumably for fear
of doing anything vaguely
controversial as they shift
to targeting a younger au-
dience. It is left with none
of the original’s humour,
character development, or
even the core message of
its story.
My expectations were
already low, but they
dropped further upon
starting up the game and
being greeted by a ge-
neric menu and the ab-
solute bullshit that is
only having one save file
– something absolutely
ridiculous, given that the
earlier and much older
games had multiple save
slots. And it gets worse!
I understand holding the
player’s hand, especial-
ly for younger players.
However, compulsively
spewing the same effing
phrase of “get the pixelis-
er here” every 15 seconds,
with Qwark’s narration
piping in every 8 and the
enemies talking every 4
on top, is frustrating to
say the least – especial-
ly when combined with
the nauseating light show
that results from running a
bullet hell game in 30fps.
So help me God, I swear
that every time I heard the
weapons vendor screech
about a new unlock, the
imminent rage-aneurysm
the game was concocting
drew closer by anoth-
er minute – a doomsday
clock on my life and soul
as it was drained from me
by the playing experience.
And who could forget
that the game’s cutscenes
were essentially copy and
pasted from the film - ex-
cept with introductions of
villains being cut out de-
spite originally being in
the film, which just left
the game feeling like even
more of a ‘rush job’.
Don’t get me started
about the lack of charac-
ter development in the
game. There’s no form of
friction between Ratchet
and Clank, nor any sense
of lessons being learned
and attitudes changing,
which was the essence of
the original’s message of
settling one other’s dif-
ferences for the sake of a
common goal. Neither is
there any form of friend-
ship between the two char-
acters. It’s painful seeing
the complicated back-
and-forth relationship
presented in the original
game being bastardised so
much; with no faults and
a perfect alliance it feels
fake and unrealistic, and
more importantly it ren-
ders the characters two-di-
mensional. In the end the
game’s visual beauty is
akin to makeup on a pig
– you can make it prettier,
but it’s not enough to hide
the underlying faults.
