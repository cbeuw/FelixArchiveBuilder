L
ast month the
g o v e r n m e n t
announced the
Graduate visa
scheme, through which
non-EU/EEA students
graduating from a UK
university could be
granted a 2-year work
visa. This was seen as
a reimplementation of
the previous Post-Study
Work visa, which was
scrapped by the then-
Home Secretary Theresa
May back in 2012 in an
attempt to bring down
the net migration figure,
under the background of
the infamous “Hostile
Environment” policy.
Speculation remained
over the last few weeks
as to whether this new
visa scheme could benefit
current students who
have already started their
courses before the scheme
was announced. Given the
Conservative party’s track
record on immigration
policies, the outlook was
mostly negative.
A twist came as the
government responded to
an online petition titled
“Bring the date for the
post-study work visa
closer to help current
students”, which received
more than 26,000 signa-
tures as of 11 October.
The response, issued by
the Home Office, states
that “[a]ny student who
successfully completes
their degree-level course
at a qualifying institution
in the summer of 2021 or
thereafter will be eligible
to apply”. This means
that the year of entry will
not affect the eligibility
for this scheme, so long
as the student completes
the course in or after
summer 2021. In practical
terms, this would mostly
benefit 3-year Bachelor
programme students who
started after 2018, as well
as4-yearintegratedMaster
programme students who
started after 2017. Those
who will finish before
summer 2021, however,
are excluded from this
scheme.
While the 2-year
graduate visa will not
require graduates to earn
more than a certain salary
threshold, graduates must
apply for the generic
Tier-2 work visa should
they wish to remain in
the UK after the 2-year
period has elapsed.
Current immigration
policies require people to
earn more than £30,000
per year to be eligible for
this visa category, with
some limited exceptions.
This threshold is likely to
increase as the Tory-affili-
ated think tank Centre for
Social Justice has urged
the government to set the
threshold to £36,700 per
year in a policy recom-
mendation paper pub-
lished in August. Policy
recommendations from
CCJ have heavily influ-
enced actual policies set
out by the Conservative
administration in the past,
including the introduc-
tion of the controversial
Universal Credit system.
It was widely speculated
that the government will
listen to this proposal.
The uncertainty
remains as to whether the
current government can
last until 2021. Should the
Conservative party fail to
form a government after
the imminent yet-to-be-
called General Election,
the 2-year graduate visa
scheme will not be imple-
mented exactly as how it
was announced. However,
almost all the major op-
position parties, including
Labour and the Liberal
Democrats, are in favour
of reforming the current
immigration policies
established by Theresa
May’s 9-year tenure as
the Home Secretary and
then the Prime Minister.
Labour has consistently
supported UK graduates’
right to work and called
for the Tier-2 visa salary
threshold to be lowered.
On the other hand, since
the Brexit Party lead by
Nigel Farage has done
consistently well in recent
opinion polls, it is not
impossible for the Con-
servative party to form a
minority government with
the Brexit Party, in which
case the Brexit Party may
press for a more hard-
line immigration policy
to further reduce the net
migration figure.
It should be noted,
however, that neither the
graduate visa scheme nor
the visa salary threshold

“An online
petition titled
“Bring the date

study work
visa closer to

should affect EU, EEA
and Swiss nationals
already in the UK. All EU,
EEA and Swiss nationals
currently living in the
UK can apply through the
EU Settlement Scheme
to remain in the UK
after Brexit. This is true
regardless of the political
situations surrounding
Brexit, including in the
no-deal scenario.
