The Aftermath of the Extinction Rebellion Ban in
London by the Police
A
s of Monday
the 14th, the
Scotland Yard
has announced
that all Extinction
Rebellion (XR) protests
must cease. The Met’s
has banned all protests
linked to the XR ‘Autumn
Uprising’ under Section
14 of the Public Order
Act. Since then, the police
have cleared infrastructure
from protest sites such
as Trafalgar square and
Vauxhall. Several were
arrested the night where
the ban was announced,
including Green Party
MEP Ellie Chowns.
Professor David Mead,
a specialist in UK Human
Rights Law, has suggested
the move could contradict
both European and British
law. The ban has also
been called unlawful by
Amnesty International,
the world’s leading human
rights organization, and
the legitimacy of arrests
has been questioned by
law experts, as over 1,600
arrests have been made.
The decision to ban
XR protests has caused
public uproar and was
met with widespread crit-
icism. Politicians, human
rights groups and leading
environmental figures
have condemned the ban.
Adam Wagner, a Human
rights lawyer has called
the Metropolitan Police’s
ban ‘draconian and ex-
tremely heavy-handed’.
Greta Thunberg has
encouraged protestors to
defy the city-wide ban,
on her Instagram, she
wrote “If standing up
against the climate and
ecological breakdown and
for humanity is against the
rules then the rules must
be broken.” The Extinc-
tion Rebellion has also
encouraged protestors to
defy the ban, the releases
a statement saying:
“Following the decision
to ban peaceful protest in
London, we are calling
on everyone to assemble
in Trafalgar Square to
defend our civil liberties.”
The ban has faced huge
backlash and the public
is in defiance. Although
Trafalgar Square had
previously been cleared
of its infrastructure and
protestors on Monday. As
of Wednesday, protesters
have returned to Trafalgar
square in defiance of
the ruling. According to
Extinction Rebellion,
approximately 5,000

joining Extinction Rebel-
lion protests there.
Other protests after the
ban includes protests in
front of Google HQ. Over
100 mothers gathered,
many bringing their
babies. The protest against
Google was sparked by
a Guardian investigation
which discovered that
google has been funding
organisations that actively
questions the need for
action on the climate
crisis or organisations
that campaigns against
environmental legislation.
Youths have also been
protesting at YouTube
space. Some climbed on
top of the YouTube space,
a letter was delivered to
YouTube’s employees
calling for an end to video
content that promotes
climate change denial.
On Thursday there is also
plans to target London
Underground and disrupt
transport on Thursday.
Sadiq Khan, the Mayor
of London, has said that
he was not aware of
the decision to ban XR
protests. In a statement
from twitter he said,
“Neither I nor the Deputy
Mayor for Policing and
Crime was informed
before the Metropolitan
Police took the opera-
tional decision to impose
a Section 14 order on
Extinction Rebellion
Autumn Uprising last
night.” He also declared:
“I’ve met with senior
officers today to seek
further information on
why they deemed this
necessary.”
The leaders of the XR
movement have declared
that they are planning
to launch legal action to
combat the ban. As of
Wednesday, the Lawyers
for XR have been at the
High Court to apply for a
judicial review of the ban,
amid claims that the order
is not legal and breaches
the right to protest.
Overall, it is very clear
that the ban is facing great
resistance. It is very clear
that people will not give
up this important cause. It
is also apparent, that the
public is appalled by this
intervention, which is also
considered disproportion-
ate to the action of the
protestors. The injustice
of this ban is particularly
upsetting, as in the UK
people have always had
the right to protest peace-
fully, the crackdown on
peaceful protests is rem-
iniscent of governments
with terrible human rights
track records. There will
be a lot of tension between
protestors and the police
over the coming weeks,
as neither side wants to
back down. Furthermore,
there will be intense legal
battles in court, as the
legality of the ban is put
into question.
