the firm. The combined
shareholder equity, i.e.
how much external
investors own of the
company, is calculated
by deducting the total
liabilities from the total
assets. Liabilities are the
exact opposite of assets;
the term includes all of
the firm’s debts and costs
of operation. A compa-
ny’s balance sheet will
always include assets
and liabilities, which
means equity can be
easily calculated. If the
total equity is positive,
this means the business’
assets generate enough
value to cover the costs
of its liabilities. In case of
negative equity, liabilities
exceed the value of the
assets. Should that trend
continue for an extended
period of time, the firm
will be facing insolvency.
A company is deemed
insolvent when it can no
longer pay off its debts.
Insolvency should not
be confused with bank-
ruptcy, which is a court
order specifying how the

more frequently, a group

The agreement between
lender and borrower lists
the sum to be provided
along with the interest
rate. The latter is deter-
mined by the credit rating
of the borrower.An entity
that is viewed more likely
to default on its debts has
a low credit rating, while
the opposite holds for
an institution with a high
credit rating. It is worth
mentioning that lenders
tend to sell bonds to other
investors in the bond
market. A bond which
has been resold multiple
times indicates the
market is confident in the
issuer’s ability to repay
the bond. Therefore, the
credit rating reflects in-
vestors confidence in the
particular organisation.

However, investing
in shares is inherently
risky since no guarantee
exists that the firm’s
value will appreciate
over time. Historically,
the stockmarket has been
volatile, going through

losses followed by inter-

the other hand, bonds
provide stable income

thus viewed as less risky

Discussing Bonds
A bond constitutes an
entirely different method
of fundraising. Bonds can
be thought of as finan-
cial instruments which
include the sum of money
borrowed and when that
amount has to be repaid
by the borrower. Particu-
larly, every bond contains
a deadline for paying off
the principal of the loan,
i.e. the original amount
borrowed, as well as a
fixed interest repayment
schedule. This fixed
interest is known as the
coupon rate of the bond.
The question is, how do
bonds work?
Initially, an entity that
wants to raise capital
issues a bond. Govern-

The Last Word
It has become evident
that equity and bonds
serve the same purpose
but in very different
ways. The first provides
corporations with access
to capital in exchange
for an ownership stake,
while the latter serves as
a direct method of raising
funds, usually needed for

The answer is both.
As a general principle,
investors want to build a

equity as well as bonds,
