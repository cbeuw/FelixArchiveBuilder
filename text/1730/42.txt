Y
ou get it. You
really get
it. You’ve
attended your
Department’s Careers
Presentation, you’ve
seen the networking
events being advertised,
and you get it: you need
a LinkedIn profile.
Here at NegaFelix we
are dedicated to bring
you expert advice from
to help you create the
best profile, to attract
recruiters – and more.
#1: A sick profile
picture.
Nobody wants to hire a
nerd. You want something
that draws recruiters in,
something that says ‘I’m
an Instagram model on the
streets and a workaholic,
caffeine-fuelled mess
suffering from Imposter
Syndrome and years of
Imperial isolation in the
sheets’. Go ahead and
use that VSCO filter but
remember it won’t take
the PTSD from your eyes.
Sksksksksksks.
#2: What you did on
your gap yah.
The 2 hour shift in the
coffee shop you did
has given you such an
incredible understanding
of the value of money.
But don’t stop there. Tell
those hungry, hungry
headhunters exactly how
many articles you’ve
published in that local
Nigerian newspaper, all
those houses you’ve built,
and how many children’s
lives you’ve lifted out
of poverty because of
the English lessons you
gave and the crayons you
donated.
#3: What private
school you went to.
You know recruiters
prefer reading resumes
written by PWMummy
and Dadloitte. Remember,
if you got in on a full
scholarship, it doesn’t
count.
often to the bitter end.
1-20 hours: You are the
“fish are friends” shark.
You probably have female
friends.
20-60 hours: You are
the cookie cutter shark.
Generic and boring. Juul
elsewhere.
60-100 hours: You have
the attitude required to fill
out a Metric minimum
barspend on your own.
Purely on Jagerbombs.
You have pounded the
boards for long enough.
Welcome. It is time for
your reward.
100+: YOU ARE THE
MEGAALAADOOON.
#7: Make sure
everyone knows what
socioeconomic class
you belong to.
For optimal effect, open LinkedIn on two devices // idsa
Include what ply of toilet
paperyouuse.(Thecorrect
answer is three-ply, by the
way – comfortably upper
middle class, but not
outrageously so).
#8: Your strawpedo
time.
Your pint time. Your
#4: Upload your
Oxbridge rejection
feedback.
Make sure it’s
appropriately stained with
all your tears.
#5: Don’t have an
especially thick neck.
#6: The number of
hours you’ve spent
prowling at Metric.
You want recruiters to
see your perseverance
and willingness to endure
hardships. You set a goal
in mind and you pursue it,
dining room table to fridge
time (slower is better).
Vomit from a shoe time,
loafers only, no socks.
#9: Your sincere and
enduring love for the
rightful and glorious
leader, Xi JinPing, and
the benelovent CCP.
#10: Make sure your
prions have enough
folds.
