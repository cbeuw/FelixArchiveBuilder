committing petty theft - to
explain that, we need to
go right back through the
history of the sport of
mascotry.
The origins of mascotry
are unclear, but it was
a game between many
London Universities to
steal the most ridiculous
of objects from each
other. One of the most
famous incidents was
published in the Daily
Mail in October 1929,
when students attempted
to capture Phineas (Uni-
versity College London’s
mascot, a wooden effigy
of a kilted Highlander,
stolen from a shop outside
Tottenham Court Road in
March 1900). The article
read: ‘A dilapidated motor
car containing [Phineas]
was last night pushed
into Downing Street and
left in front of No. 10’
and added that it ‘looked
as if it had come from
a rubbish dump’. This
rivalry between universi-
ties has since died down,
and most of their Mascots
have retired to glass
display cases. However,
the tradition is very much
still alive at Imperial,
with there being several
incidents a year.
To kick off the sport
this year, the pesky sci-
entists of the RCSU stole
our ‘Spanner’ and ‘Bolt’
on Monday. I must admit
that I had a part to play in
this; earlier that day I let
the RCSU President, Alex
Auyang, into the Guilds
office under the guise of
‘friendship’. By the time
he left, he had gotten hold
of my key card, only to
use it to return and swipe
the mascots while I was at
FiveSixEight with a few
committee members.
We returned to CAGB
350, finding it strange that
the lights were already
on. It didn’t take long
for us to notice that our
display case, which once
contained our pride and
joy ‘Spanner’ and ‘Bolt’,
was empty, and a note left
in their place. We were
devastated, and the RCSU
memorabilia scattered
around the office (includ-
ing a tie and a Freshers’
handbook) really drove
the point home that they
had violated our mascots.
Panic ensued on
the Guilds Committee
Facebook group chat once
we broke the news to
them. Various methods of
retrieving ‘Spanner’ and
‘Bolt’ were suggested,
through both legal and…
less legal means. After a
lot of discussion, it was
decided that we would
steal the Davy lamp in
the hopes that we could
ransom the Miners to steal
back our mascots from the
Scientists, or at least, we
could offer them a fair
trade.
The plan was set.
During Union Council the
following evening, when
it would be guaranteed
that Chris would not be in
the RSM office, we were
tostealDavyandstorehim
in an undisclosed location.
The raid, needless to say,
was successful and as of
today the lamp remains
in our possession. As it
stands, the scientists still
have our mascots in their
possession and with our
Welcome Dinner next
weekend, we are very
keen to get them back. The
story is still unfolding, so
make sure you keep up to
date with our escapades
through our social media
channels as well as in next
week’s column. In the
meantime, if you happen
to find ‘Spanner’or ‘Bolt’,
feel free to ‘retrieve’ them
for us…
I
f you’ve kept up
with our glorious
Guilds column so
far, you’ll have read
three of Tom’s articles…
and you’ll probably agree
with me when I say that’s
three too many. I thought
I’d take over and bring a
fresh voice to your CU
pages and give you a little
breakdown on what’s
been happening in and
around CAGB 350.
On a fairly miserable
Tuesday evening, with
nothing better to do, I
decided to go to the first
Union Council of the year.
I know we bang on about
enjoying life and making
the most of your Imperial
experience, but I’ve
gotten to a point where I
find people talking Union
politics “fun”. I know.
Let me set the scene. I
was sitting a few metres
behind Chris Carter, the
RSMU president. Unbe-
knownst to him, I was
frantically typing away
on Facebook Messenger
to the Guilds committee
- who were organising a
raid of the RSMU office.
The aim? To capture the
miner’s beloved Mascot
‘Davy’ and various other
paraphernalia. Now,
you may be asking why
the guildspeople were
spending their evening ‘Spanner’and‘Bolt’, the CGCU mascots // CGCU

H
ello and
welcome to
another edition
of ICSMSU’s
Felix column!
Apologies we haven’t
been here for the last
couple of weeks - our
entire SU has been in-
credibly busy putting on
our fortnight of events
a morning touching on
everything from Malala
to the Obamas, everyone
headed down to the river
for a first boat party on the
new boat, even ‘decked’
out with a rooftop garden
to enjoy the rain. I’m very
pleased to say one of the
very few who needed
taking home was an older
year.
The fortnight contin-
ued in lavish, unrivalled
ICSM style at a range of
other events spanning
the two weeks. Some
highlights included: a
record breaking number at
our non-drinking events,
some tenacious rain-
won’t-stop-me attitude at
the Endgames, and some
crazy on-stage antics
during the Reynolds show
(which are probably best
left to the imagination).
We hope all the freshers
enjoyed and have made
loads of new mates
- you’re such a great
bunch we even massively
enjoyed being completely
sober every evening stew-
arding...
In other news, there are
some fantastic welfare
campaigns kicking off
(check out ICSM’s own
Black History Month
campaign on Instagram
and Facebook - some very
inspiring people have
taken part) and more to
come. The academics
have started our regular
meetings with faculty
to keep them abreast of
any issues, and the ents
team have already started
working on Snow Ball!
Check out all the rest
of the things we’ve been
up to on our social media,
and until next week: have
fun, stay safe!
to welcome the new
students, which we hope
you’re excited to hear
about.
The fortnight started
bright and early on
Monday morning with
various invigorating
speeches and addresses
from the Big Dogs in
College (and ICU), a
welcome from our SU,
and then it was straight
into launching the New
Curriculum with some
TBL for the poor fresh-
faced youngsters. After
