Medicine and
Physiology
A
lthough we
have been
aware of the
importance of
oxygen for life for centu-
ries, there was little to no
insight on how cells adapt
to varying levels of it. This
year’s Nobel laureates in
Medicine and Physiology
– Sir Peter J. Ratcliffe
(University of Oxford,
UK, The Francis Crick
Institute, UK), William
G. Kaelin Jr. (Harvard
Medical School, USA)
and Gregg L. Semenza
(John Hopkins University,
USA) were the ﬁrst ones
to identify the molecular
machinery that regulates
the activity of genes in
response to changing
levels of oxygen and
how this affects cellular
function and metabolism.
Their research is seminal
in both giving a more
thorough understanding
of biological processes
and paving the way
towards novel treatments
that could combat several
conditions, including
cancer or anemia.
Examples of adaptive
processes that are con-
trolled by oxygen sensing
include production of red
blood cells (erythropoie-
sis) and formation of new
blood vessels, ﬁne-tuning
of the immune system
and fetal development.
Equally important,
oxygen is central to many
diseases, including cancer
where, the oxygen-regu-
lated machinery is used to
initiate angiogenesis (the
formation of new blood
vessels) and alter metab-
olism to help cancer cells
replicate.
