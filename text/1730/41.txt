M
ascotry has
always been
about having
fun. The tra-
dition has its origins in the
early history of Imperial
College, when the three
constituent colleges (RCS,
RSM, CGI) were merged.
Each college wanted
something to display its
own identity and so made
a college mascot.
The aim of the game
is simple – to ‘relieve’
another union of their
mascot, and hold it
ransom. The union whose
mascot has been stolen
must then pay a ransom
(which can be any sort of
request within reason) or
try to steal it back. The
interesting part is the theft
itself. Many a carefully
planned heist has been
thwarted by leaked infor-
mation, a double agent, or
by sheer brute force of the
opposition.
A union usually has
two kinds of mascot –
violate and inviolate.
Violate mascots may be
‘violated’ i.e. stolen and
held to ransom, and invi-
olate mascots must not be
stolen. Our violate mascot
is called Theta the Ther-
mometer. It is a 7-foot-tall
solid steel thermometer,
which weighs in at over
100 pounds. The current
theta is the 4th in a lineage
of theta mascots and was
forged on the lathe of the
RCS motor club in 1975.
Our inviolate mascot is a
vintage 1916 Dennis fire
engine named Jezebel (a
biblical name meaning
scarlet lady). She is
looked after and manned
by the RCS Motor Club
and is the official transport
of the RCSU president. If
anyone tries to steal Jez,
we call the police!
Unfortunately, the sport
of mascotry has died down
in the past few years. With
the student body showing
waning interest in the con-
stituent unions, it’s signif-
icantly more difficult to
convince people to carry a
100-pound lump of metal
while being chased by a
hordeofangryGuildsmen.
Nowadays, its mostly
committee members who
get involved in mascotry,
and a select few at that.
In some ways, that’s fair
enough; I never cared
about or knew about Theta
before I became president.
However, now that I’m
here, I see how much
the constituent unions
could do for the students
of Imperial. While a
silly thing like mascotry
doesn’t directly affect
most students, it allows
for us to have a greater
sense of identity rather
than being an “Imperial
student”.
In any case, if you see
someone carrying a giant
thermometer, maybe
double check that they’re
an RCSU member. Who
knows when the CGCU
will want revenge.
