FELIX ISSUE 1730
fsudoku@imperial.ac.uk
THROWBACK felix@imperial.ac.uk
Felix has been made aware that many students did not get to witness the first centrefold of the year, featuring
the Editor as is tradition, due to distribution mostly going to halls. In the spirit of fairly embarrassing the Editor
to maximum capacity, as is surely the point of the tradition, we decided to re-run that first Centrefold this week
as part of the Throwback section!
We also wanted to make something clear: you do not have to be Shakespeare to write for us. In fact, any
student, alumni, or even staff member can get in contact with us to get involved. Whether you love writing,
editing, copyediting, video production, interviews, live reporting, illustrating, photography, anything you can
imagine, there is a place for your content at Felix!
Pick something you love. Hell, pick something that you hate and want to complain about. We’re here to serve
as the student voice of Imperial, and a central point for communication across the whole cohort. We’d love
to hear from you - so pick up your pens and/or laptops, get in touch, and we’ll work with you to turn out a
smashing article. Something you can proudly keep and show off for years to come, and that will be preserved
in the Felix archives for decades or longer.
Or, for you visual learners out there: we mean what we say in these recruitment ads!
Felix is recruiting!
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, reporters, computer
experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach you everything you need to
know. If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk
