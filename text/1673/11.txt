“Google’s Pixel
2 achieved a
DXO camera
rating of
98 – the
highest of any
smartphone”
free, small and compact
and has a high-quality
lens and shutter button.
Where it comes into its
own though is on the
inside – the camera has
built-in machine learning.
It learns who and when to
take photos of, focusing
on movement and faces.
One neat feature is Motion
Photos – the camera takes
burst of shots to produce
a moving photo (like a
GIF). The Google Clips
isn’t in production yet,
with Google saying it will
be “coming soon” and will
initially sell for $249.
Google Pixel 2 and
Google Pixel 2 XL
Now for the announce-
ment everyone was
waiting for: the Pixel
2 will succeed the very
successful Pixel and Pixel
XL. As with its predeces-
sor, Google announced
both a smaller Pixel 2 (five
inch screen) and a larger
Pixel 2 XL (six inches).
The materials used are
similar to last year’s
smartphone – a mix of
glass and aluminium. The
design I’m sure will be a
Marmite situation: some
will love it, others will
hate it. Google popped in
a bit of fun this year with
a coloured power button
just because they can.
The Pixel 2 sports an HD
OLED display whilst the
XL has a POLED QHD+
display.
The usual suspects also
turned up: a fingerprint
sensor (in the right place,
on the back of the phone),
USB-C charging and IP67
dust and water resistance.
For Pixel’s second itera-
tion, Google listened to
its critics and added in
two front facing stereo
speakers and included an
Active Edge feature to
squeeze the phone and
activate Google Assistant
– a nod to the HTC de-
signers behind the project
I’m sure. HOWEVER,
Google removed the trusty
headphone jack – a sign
of the times I’m afraid.
The trademark feature of
the Pixel and Pixel XL – a
seven hour charge in 15
minutes remains in the
second edition, but the
newly updated Android
Oreo UI brings lots of
exciting new features. The
new Always On display
shows the time and no-
tifications without you
even having to wake up
the phone. Now Playing is
another feature straight on
the lock screen – Google
uses its machine learning
capabilities to work out
what song is playing in the
background automatically.
Exclusive to the Pixel
2 range, Google Lens,
built into the camera app,
allows you to take a photo
of something interesting
and Google will tell you
what it is! Finally, the
Pixel was famous for its
camera and Google were
keen to continue this
The most eagerly awaited products announced at the event – The Google Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL. // expertreviews.co.uk
The PixelBook is Google’s second laptop // Google
in their second edition:
the Pixel 2 achieved a
DXO camera rating of
98, the highest of any
smartphone camera ever.
Machine learning collects
double the information
even though there is only
one camera, allowing for
amazing portrait mode
photos and selfies! The
Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL
will be available in Aus-
tralia, Canada, Germany,
India, the UK and the US
– retailing for £649 and
£849 respectively. Later
in the year the Pixel 2 and
Pixel 2 XL will be hitting
stores in Singapore, Italy
and Spain!
That’s the rundown of
the Google Announce-
ment, a series of products
with a common theme
– software that keeps on
giving thanks to machine
learning. They will help
society become increas-
ingly connected both at
home and on the move,
but is that a good thing? Is
it not just a big corporation
constantly listening in on
our daily lives? Only the
sales figures will tell how
people truly feel...
