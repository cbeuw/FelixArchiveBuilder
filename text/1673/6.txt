P
eople rejoice! The
brutal dictator
General Fyles is
no more! His evil
reign has finally come to
an end, after a prolonged
internal struggle, led by
the brave Colonel Alan
Perfect and ably sup-
ported by Major Charles
Titmuss. We have retaken
the Comment section and
restored it to Freedom,
Liberty, and Truth! The
management wish to
reassure those that live
under the new duumvirate
that business will continue
as usual provided their
Loyalty remains unques-
tioned. Traitors to the
Cause, and those that write
better Comment articles
neglected child of Felix,
the Comment section is
set in the unloved middle
of the newspaper, only
occasionally seeing the
light of day as people
desperately search for the
centrefold. Despite this
ignominious situation, the
Comment section remains
a crucial and vibrant part
of the newspaper, rather
like some forms of non-le-
thal bacteria. It is the most
critical part of a student
newspaper, as it creates a
space for measured debate
and the careful expression
of opinion by students and
staffaboutarangeoftopics
that they are interested in,
engaging with the rest of
Imperial on sometimes
highly sensitive subjects.
A good example from
last year was the article
written on Tie Clubs in
Felix issue 1661 that
provoked significant
debate all over the univer-
sity. We are both looking
forward (at least I am) to
creating and editing more
articles that split opinion
to the same degree. This
leads perfectly into the
next excellent thing
about the Felix Comment
section: people read the
articles that you create,
and will be interested in
your perspective. You can
have an impact on the way
that your peers – some
of whom will no doubt
become very successful
individuals – view an
issue that you care about,
and raise awareness of
that issue, all as a result
of the research that you
have done and the article
you have created. It is
not necessary to possess
any particular skill as a
wordsmith, or I would
definitely not be writing!
If you have an idea for an
article, simply come down
to the Felix basement and
talk it over with either one
of us. Don’t worry about
the fact it’s in a basement:
think Steve Jobs and not
50 Shades of Grey.
I have been warned
about the sensitive
handling required for
certain subjects, but I am
nearly always on side of
freedom of expression. If
a view is controversial it
is not productive to sweep
said view under the carpet.
It is far more useful if that
view is expressed in an ar-
ticulate fashion, so that it
can then be considered and
understood in context, and
A
ll hail Major
Charlie Titmuss
and Colonel
Alan Perfect,
the new supreme leaders
of the Comment section!
Fred Fyles has been finally
overthrown! I would like
to thank my mum, my
friends, the FA, and espe-
cially Muammar Gaddafi,
who was a great source
of inspiration in this coup
d’état.
This year we want
the Comment section to
become the most high-pro-
file part of Felix. We know
it has been sometimes
neglected, but we can
restore it to the place it
deserves: as an outlet for
any Imperial student to
voice their opinions on
issues they care about.
We are well aware that
your opinions as a student
matter, and we will use all
our strengths to make sure
they are properly heard.
A format we want to
emphasise this year in
the section is the “head
to head” page, which will
look exactly as this article
looks next to Charlie’s on
the left. You might be one
of those people that loves
an internet discussion,
and is able to craft some
beautifully long, properly
sourced arguments on
a reply to an obscure
Facebook thread. This
format is then definitely
for you. Get the person you
disagree with to write an
article, write one yourself,
and we will display it as a
head to head debate here
in Felix for all students to
see. You will be amazed
by the response you get.
Felix is ultimately about
raising the issues you care
about. You don’t have to
be Union President for
your voice to be heard. We
have had some amazing
comment pieces come to
us during these past years,
from articles steering
important debates about
mental health to passion-
ate discussions about how
terrible ales are if you’re
European. If anything
bothers you about the uni-
versity experience, why
quit at just raising it with
your Year Rep? Here, at
the Comment section, we
will make sure your initi-
atives, frustrations, ideas,
and rants can be properly
heard. Hell, we will even
help you out to make sure
you word them right.
Be the change you want
to be. Have a positive
impact. Write for Felix.

than either of us, will be
dealt with swiftly…
Propaganda aside, the
Comment section of Felix
is now officially up and
running! A significant
change when compared
to last year’s Felix is the
split of the Comment
section into the Politics
section which deals far
more with specific topics,
and the Comment section,
that will probably deal
with whatever the Politics
Editors decide they don’t
want. Traditionally the
“At the end of
the day, I need
something
to read in
lectures”
if necessary disassembled
and defeated. However,
I recognise that freedom
of expression comes with
the freedom to take the
consequences. Occasion-
ally the consequences of
publication may be too
risky, but it is something I
am willing to discuss, and
pretty much all topics are
fair game!
Finally, and most im-
portantly, send in articles!
At the end of the day, I
need something to read
during lectures and it
might as well be content
that you created!
Vive la révolution!
