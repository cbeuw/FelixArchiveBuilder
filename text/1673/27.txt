IC Rubgy make another brave attempt, but Surrey’s strength lead to commiseratory pints and A&E visits.

L
ast week’s fixture
against Surrey
saw a determined
Imperial 1st XV
turn up in force, ready to
put the previous week’s
fixture against Reading
behind them and get some
points in the league table.
A sharp, no-messing-
about warm up reflected
this mood, as did the start
of the match; after kicking
off, our aggressive blitz
defence paid dividends as
Surrey coughed up posses-
sion. Quick to respond, we
counter-attacked, which
saw the ball whipped
out wide and then halted
five metres from the line.
Several pick-and-goes
later and Michael Radigan
was bundled over the line.
With the try converted by
fresher João’s idol James
Field, we were 7-0 up
within five minutes.
Shortly after the restart,
Slytherin mudblood Ben
Jones was forced off
the field with a shoulder
injury. Alex Amato,
sensing Ben’s serpentine
tendencies long before
that evening’s social,
offered no condolences to
his teammate as he slith-
ered off the field. Sensing
a chance to swing the
momentum in their favour,
Surrey attacked with
vigour and were rewarded
with an unconverted try
in the corner to get within
two points. The referee,
keen to get involved,
began dictating the game
by awarding penalty
after penalty, whipping
himself into a frenzy
of officiating. Nathan
Surrey took full advantage
of Imperial’s depleted
ranks, a penalty ensuring
they reached halftime with
a slight advantage, leading
8-7.
The second half got
underway smoothly,
Imperial once again
building pressure with
good attacking structure.
However, with everyone
in the team deciding to
follow club captain Toby’s
example by dislocating
their shoulders, it was
“The referee,
keen to begin
dictating the
match, started
awarding
penalty after
penalty”
Tomlinson, unaware of
this carnage, and perhaps
after one too many grecs,
rashly smashed through a
ruck and earned himself
a 10 minute opportunity
to reflect on his actions.
Surrey who drew first
blood after the break,
another penalty pushing
them to an 11-7 lead.
This inspired the team to
respond, Allingham and
McGrail creating line
breaks left and right with
well-timed pops. This led
to Amato showing his
blistering pace to score
a superb try and give IC
a slim 12-11 lead with
10 minutes remaining.
However, as is becoming
the norm, we were simply
“The team
were inspired
to respond,
Allingham
and McGrail
creating line
breaks left and
right with well-
timed pops”
unable to see the game
out, and succumbed to a
penalty and a last-play
try to stumble to a 19-12
loss and walk away only
with a single bonus point.
Commiseratory pints were
on self-made barman
Louis Benson, whilst
Nate joined banned-from-
union squad in A&E for
the second week running.
Sylvia sleeps on.
