A
t the world’s
top academic
institutions,
the pressure to
achieve can be all-con-
suming. Often I find
myself walking amongst
high-flyers, questioning
what drives this culture
of self-sustaining com-
petition. An innate drive
emanates from these stu-
dents, one that cannot be
contained. For those that
compare less favourably
academically, there is a
feeling of inadequacy that
perpetually lurks in the
back of the mind, casting
a shadow over what they
do. One imagines the
top of the class to be the
complete opposite, but,
sadly, candid accounts
of student experiences
suggest otherwise.
The modern world has
redefined what it means to
be a student. A good job
means good food, decent
housing, and, perhaps,
some disposable income.
Getting one requires
meticulous planning, but
job security and longevity
is no longer a certainty.
Sceptics will argue
find someone who would
disagree. According to a
study carried out by New
York University in 2015,
chronic stress that starts
from secondary school
and persists well into
university years is not
a rare finding amongst
high-achieving students.
In a world that has
become so interconnected
via technology, having
the confidence to be our
own person is difficult.
The effect of social media
and clickbait news is
omnipresent. Perceptions
are moulded and formed
as quickly as information
is transmitted from one
screen to another – at the
speed of light. The concept
of self and knowing
oneself has never been
more challenging than
before, but self-help books
cater for all spectrums of
situations and problems.
Therein lies their magic.
Self-help books intend
to help their readership
live better lives by offering
practical solutions and
advice to a wide variety of
human problems from the
professional to the very
personal. I discovered this
genre out of curiosity in a
chance encounter whilst
browsing an independent
bookstore, and have been
an avid reader of their
be comforting in difficult
times, their spirit to be
an indispensable guiding
light and their optimism
to be the very definition of
positive energy.
I believe self-help books
can play a fundamental
role in re-establishing the
principles that make self,
self. There are tips galore
about how to live our lives
– outlets like BuzzFeed
are a favourite present-day
source – but there is
something irreplaceable
about the semi-academic
rigour of a good self-help
book. They bring a deeper
and more substantial
perspective, one that
allows reflection upon
current life practices, in a
manner which is decidedly
non-judgemental.
Of course, there will be
those who are sceptical.
Detractors might claim
that self-help book content
is all common sense and
nothing special; some
will claim that real world
experience is the only way
to learn, and that loading
up on theory will never be
the solution. Whilst there
is something to be said
for all the numerous coun-
ter-arguments, they all
reveal a level of cynicism
that cannot be healthy.
But there are many self-
help books – where should
one start? Of course, the
best-sellersandthe‘classic
texts’ come highly recom-
mended, but the truth is
the starting point is not
of huge significance. Two
contemporary volumes
that are easily accessible
and offer actionable steps
are Designing your Life
by Bill Burnett and Dave
Evans, and How to Have
a Good Day by Caroline
Webb. These books will
introduce some of the most
pertinent and relevant
self-help thought lead-
ership – the recognised
cutting-edge thinking in
the field of study. Expect
answers to your failing war
with procrastination and to
your currently unknown
life purpose. From here,
you might choose to
engage in further study
with more academic texts,
and maybe even go on to
develop a passion for the
genre. When acquainted
with the literature, there
will be similar themes
that emerge, and some
will appear to ‘repeat’
the same principles. The
reason for this is clear:
there are a few principles
that work, but they can be
rather challenging, nigh
impossible, to execute

Finishing the night in Heaven: inclusive,

Is ICSMSU’s decision to return to an LGBT+ venue as the after-party for its freshers’ pub crawl
well intentioned or inherently problematic?

he question, “Is
it ever accept-
able for straight
people in large
groups to congregate in
an LGBT+ space?” is a
contentious issue, and – in
recent media – a divisive
one. I’d like to make
my position perfectly
clear: there is something
incredibly special about
gay venues; something
which, I believe, should
be respected and protected
by all.
This may be mistaken
as ‘heterophobia’ by dis-
gruntled straight people
who are not used to being
routinely discriminated
against for their sexuality
or gender identity. But
it is failure to recognise
this privilege which
leads to ignorance about
the reason these venues
exist: they provide a
haven for LGBT+ people
to surround ourselves
with like-minded people
and express ourselves,
away from the oppressive
society where we feel we
can’t. They are places
where heteronormativity
is not the norm, and we are
no longer the minority.
Don’t get me wrong,
equality for LGBT+
people has come a long
way since the brave days
of the Stonewall riots. The
idea that LGBT+ people
can go anywhere without
fear of discrimination
means that there are fewer
and fewer LGBT+ spaces
remaining. This lack
makes it even more im-
portant to respect them for
what they are: gay spaces
– for gay people.
Of course, this is not
to say straight people
should be refused entry
to all gay venues, or that
straight people should
not accompany their gay
friends to such venues.
It does, however, require
straight people to reflect
venues in the country – a
fact which, incidentally,
is not mentioned on the
ICSMSU-generated event
page. If the whole medical
student body were re-
spectful, clued-up allies it
would be possible to argue
that this influx would not
threaten the safe space.
However, given that our
own Union venues are
unable to provide a similar
haven of safety for LGBT+
students – something
evidenced by the ordeal
faced by a non-binary
student in the Reynolds
bar last year, who was
nearly forcibly-removed
from the women’s bath-
room,despite union venues
claiming a zero-tolerance
numbers – the quantity of
drunk medics will so far
outnumber any LGBT+
people, that the respect
for why the venue exists
would be lost. ICSM
seems only to be further-
ing the fetishisation of
LGBT+ issues, something
which is seen year on year
by the masses of straight
people donning glitter
and celebrating Pride with
very little appreciation for
what it really means.
LGBT+ spaces are
fantastic and should be
celebrated, but they are
also not a zoo or a novelty
for freshers to marvel
at – and they should not
be used to purport an
ideal of progressiveness
without real change or
support. It is admirable
that ICSMSU would want
to pledge their support for
LGBT+ people and issues
by supporting Heaven as
a venue; however it does
beg the question if their
efforts might be better
spent evaluating their own
community.
The LGBT+ medicine
project last year raised
the fact that there was no
formal teaching about
LGBT+ issues in the
entirety of the 6 years of
the medicine curriculum –
many early years teaching
was actively outdated.
Furthermore, there is cur-
rently no LGBT+ officer
in the ICSMSU commit-
tee, nor are there events
for LGBT freshers or even
older years – just saying.
It may be uncomforta-
ble to hear, but inclusivity
and supportiveness does
not give you the right
to monopolise the safe
spaces of a minority group.
Although we like to think
we live in a society with
true equality, we are not
there yet – and we cannot
be complacent.

stance to discrimination in
all its forms – it is difficult
to argue this is the case..
Furthermore, it seems
– if only in terms of sheer
on their presence in these
spaces. Just because one is
allowed to do something
does not mean morally
it is the right thing to do,
and by bringing large
groups of straight people
to LGBT+ venues, the
purpose of such venues
is lost. It undermines
this respect for LGBT+
patrons who frequent them
simply to feel safe and be
themselves.
It is this point which
brings me to ICSMSU’s
choice to return to Heaven,
the popular gay nightclub,
as its venue for their
annual fresher’s pub crawl.
Heaven is a cracking
venue, and is thought to

flawlessly. It is important
to emphasise that the real
value of these books is
unlocked by appreciating
their interdisciplinary
nuances and working out
how they apply to you.
Nonetheless, reading a
self-help book provides an
opportunity for a fair and
kind evaluation of oneself.
It allows us to improve in
our own mind’s eye, to
be kind to ourselves. By
becoming more assured in
oneself and living off the
can-do-anything ‘growth
mindset’ high that these
books imbue, self-help
books and the modern-day
student are a perfect com-
bination. Perhaps reading
them should be made a
mandatory course require-
ment.
