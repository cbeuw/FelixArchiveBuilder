Hope amid darkness in Philip Pullman’s new series
Best-selling author Philip Pullman graces the London Literature Festival with the launch of his new novel, the
prequel to His Dark Materials.

nown for his
trilogy His
Dark Materials,
a fixture of
many of our teenage book-
shelves, Pullman is no
stranger to the best-seller
charts. La Belle Sauvage
is the much-anticipated
first volume of The Book
of Dust, which Pullman
discussed with BBC
broadcaster and fellow
author Cerys Matthews
at a launch event at the
Southbank Centre. The
evening began with a dis-
cussion between the two,
followed by a reading of
an extract by Pullman, and
the discussion was then
opened to the audience.
In this new volume, the
theory of dust from His
Dark Materials makes
a reappearance after 17
years, in a world where
dark matter and con-
sciousness intertwine. The
author or, as he prefers,
storyteller, combined
famous theories of
physics, complex politics,
and religion in a world
of witches, daemons, and
armoured polar bears.
This exciting new
trilogy is the unexpected
prequel to His Dark
Materials. The original
was famously known for
its beloved heroine, Lyra
Belacqua, who makes
a comeback in the new
series as a baby. This
latest novel has a more el-
ementary – or as Philip de-
dience’s singing echoed
in the hall. The viewers’
awe was palpable when
Philip read an extract of
La Belle Sauvage. Discus-
sions ranged from Philip’s
“waywardish” university
days to his journeys to the
Arctic within the pages
of books of the Bodleian
Library, at Oxford Uni-
versity. We find how his
roots in Oxford inspired
a range of settings for His
Dark Materials and La
Belle Sauvage as well as
the influence of the more
exotic scenes from books
he’s read.
The most intriguing part
of Pullman’s discussion
was the use of rhythm in
his sentences and how he
needs silence in order to
focus on the rhythms of
following sentences. In
addition, he also touched
on children’s style of
learning and reading – he
believes imagination
begins when children
are read stories by their
parents or guardians,
which encourages the
seeking of adventures and
ideas within books. He
expressed disappointment
at the current educational
system, which ranks
children and forces young-
sters to form opinions and
express them aloud to the
teacher – opinions and
analysis of poems should
remain within the heart
of the child, he said, so
they can look back and
remember the naturality
was the darker tone due
to the growing cynicism
of the author? Does it
reflect on the growing
cynicism of adults in the
modern world? When
asked this, he replied that
adults don’t become more
cynical, only more aware,
but amongst the darkness
of it all there is always
hope – interspersed in the
darkness of the book, just
like in our reality.
Audience’s questions
also sparked riveting
discussions where two
in particular caught the
author off guard, which he
seemed to appreciate: one
spectator questioned how
the integration of the sex-
ualisation of young people
through social media and
wider access to porn on
the internet would work
in the world of magic
born from the innocence
of children; another asked
about the integration of
disability, particularly
deaf people, and how they
would communicate with
their daemons. Though
the answer to both of these
questions was “I don’t
know”, he commented
on how his books were
written in an age where
“The latest
novel is
tangled
with the
issues of the
environment
and inequality”
scribed it, “watery” – feel
which is tangled with the
issues of the environment
and inequality in a fiercer
tone than before.
The fact that it was
his birthday made the
evening’s atmosphere
more magical as the au-
the internet did not exist.
As for disability, perhaps
daemons could use sign
language for communica-
tion.
If you’re as big as a fan
as I am it would be good
to know that Pullman
disclosed his daemon to
us as a “shabby, knock-
kneed, feathers missing,
dust-covered, old raven”.
His second book of The
Book of Dust is written,
“Pullman
said that
knowledge
and the
seeking of it is
what makes us
human”
of their own opinion. His
stand on the “original
sin”, which is mentioned
in his previous trilogy,
is that it is “almost blas-
phemous” to call it a sin,
because knowledge and
the seeking of it is what
makes us human. A round
of applause followed with
bouts of cheering.
The evening’s discus-
sion touched on a wide
range of topics and themes;
“Amongst the
darkness of La
Belle Sauvage
there is always
hope, just like
in our own
reality”
but has yet to be edited.
In the meantime, La Belle
Sauvage will keep us all
occupied.

AUTUMN
by Ali Smith
B
ooks which lack
speech marks
always scare me.
It can seem like
they’re trying too hard
just to break a rule and
look contemporary. But I
should never have doubted
Ali Smith, in whose new
book, Autumn, it feels
entirely appropriate. It
freed the author to skip
between characters and
to entwine her own voice
with the text. No visual
breaks signal a change in
the dialogue and the fic-
tional people seep into our
reality. It feels like they
would fit in.
Elisabeth is a lecturer in
history of art, although her
job isn’t entirely stable.
She is on a mission to
renew her passport. Daniel
is her “artsy art” friend
from childhood with a
century’s worth of wisdom
to impart. He is holed up
in a care home, always
asleep and allegedly close
to death. Jumps through
time allow glimpses into
their relationship and
beautifully ordinary lives.
Nothing they do seems
impossible, although they
have some pretty wacky
dreams. It is a joy to come
across the usual opener
of their conversations,
“What’re you reading?”,
because what follows is
always filled with quiet
tenderness.
From their first meeting
when Elisabeth is eight,
Daniel provides many
lessons. He’s a patient
teacher, and very clearly
part of the novel for a
reason. To begin with it
felt a little too obvious:
each time he appeared
it was very obviously
signposted that you should
start thinking. Daniel is
teaching Elisabeth, and
Daniel is teaching you.
Are you following? Once
I accepted this, and once
I got my head around
some of the statements, I
was drawn into the finer
elements of his character.
The mystery of his past
and his pitiful future
were enough to keep me
engaged when he appeared
on the page.
Autumn is a “novel
of ideas”, and every
sentence, spoken by
Daniel or not, seems to
lead you into some deeper
meaning. Towards the end,
an entire chapter abandons
the fictional characters to
turn its focus to two scan-
dalous real-life women:
Pauline Boty and Christine
Keeler. I had previously
heard of neither and the
novel has given me a lot
of homework. Keeler
rocketed into the public
sphere through her affair
with British politician
John Profumo and was the
subject of one of Boty’s
pop-art paintings. Their
chapter revolves around
the tragedy and beauty of
their lives, but felt a little
isolated from the rest of
the novel, both in its style
and in the fact it was the
only segment focussed
upon the year 1962.
However, this section
was the definitive cul-
mination of many strong
hints towards the theme
of feminism. It finally
struck me that all the main
characters – at least the
conscious ones – were
women. They are clever,
witty, and, most impor-
tantly, expressive. By the
end of the novel, they each
have a passion which they
joyously work for.
This was not the main
topic that I expected from
this novel. “Post-Brexit”
is a phrase that appears
in almost every article
that there is on the book.
Its presence was obvious,
but the message was
not what I expected.
Instead of focussing on a
political standing, Smith
took Brexit, along with
the Profumo affair, and
decided to explore how
a country copes with the
lies it is fed. The turmoil
presented is juxtaposed
with discussions of art,
literature, ballet, and other
cultural exploits. Expres-
sion is portrayed as the
carrier truth and a symbol
of hope.
Smith illustrates
this sentiment with the
season for which the
novel is named. At the
very end of the novel
it is November and the
season is changing: leaves
are dying, the weather is
gloomy. “All the souls are
out marauding. But there
are roses, there are still
roses.” Despite the decay,
there is persistence and
hope.
At times it seemed
best to give in to Smith’s
torrent of educational
thought and accept that I
wouldn’t follow. Instead
of stopping, going back
a page, and fretting over
every minute detail,
maximum enjoyment can
be drawn from sitting back
and enjoying the flow
from each word to the
next, sentence to sentence.
The nuances can wait until
another time, another read.
The language is simple but
strange. Experimental par-
agraphs mostly containing
seemingly random strings
of words break the rules of
plot and progression.
It truly feels like one
long poem, a form remark-
ably sustained throughout
the entire journey.
The most remarkable
thing about the novel is
that Smith wrote it in such
a short period of time. The
release date was just four
months after the fateful
vote. The topic remains a
sore subject in Britain and
many of the situations por-
trayed feel all too familiar.
It is as the novel itself
says “an old story so new
that it’s still in the middle
of happening, writing
itself right now with no
knowledge of where or
how it’ll end.” The story
is just a snapshot of events
which continue beyond its
end. As time goes on, this
book will always remain
in 2016 and take anyone
who cares to read it back
to that time.
I can’t say Autumn
changed my life, but it
certainly made me think.
