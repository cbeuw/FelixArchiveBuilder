The stories behind the data
S
o this week has
beenaweekoffirsts
for me: first time
I’ve been to Union
Council; first official
complaint made against
Felix (and certainly not
the last); and first 48-page
issue of the year. Nearly.
On Tuesday evening we
were all gearing up to do
a 48’er, which seemed like
a good idea for all of 30
minutes. Then I realised
that we still only had one
computer, and that, to par-
aphrase Meatloaf, while
I’d do anything for student
journalism, I won’t pull
an all-nighter – we’ll save
that for another time.
This week Felix has
gone survey-mad, doing
some analysis on both the
Staff Survey – which was
sent out to all staff working
at Imperial – and the Post-
graduate Research Expe-
rience Survey (PRES),
which went out to research
postgrads. Both were
largely similar, asking
people about what they
thought of the College and
their colleagues, whether
they had everything they
needed to do a good job,
whether they were happy
– the usual.
But they both threw up
some interesting results:
the staff survey showed a
huge range in results, with
some staff clearly very
content about how things
are going, and others
furious about what’s going
on on-campus. There
mainly seemed to be a
disconnect between the
Faculty/College leaders,
and the general staff,
which I think can come as
a surprise to quite a few
people. I think when a
lot of students at Imperial
grumble about how their
cooked breakfasts have
been taken away, or that
the College is being run
as a business (no judge-
ment, I love to complain),
they’re picturing Imperial
as a vast monolithic
entity, combining all staff
together into one big mass.
But the survey shows
that for a lot of staff,
our concerns are their
concerns too. A lot of
them feel powerless to
enact change; many feel
isolated within their own
department, and yearn for
collaboration; and I don’t
think anyone on campus
really understand what
‘Imperial Expectations’
are. Sometimes it turns out
you’re on the same side
after all.
Moving on to the
PRES, I think that what
this can show is the issue
of relying too heavily on
data. Based on the raw
numbers, it looks like
Imperial are doing really
well – and I’m sure they
are! Pat yourselves on the
back! – but speaking to
my postgraduate friends
paints a decidedly differ-
ent picture. .
Looking at the data
alone doesn’t show us
the people behind the
numbers. It can’t tell you
about the friends I have
who felt forced to carry
on their research when
their funding ran out, who
bounced around from
place to place, sleeping
on couches and in hostels,
trying desperately to
balance the demands of
their PhD with the mental
pressure of being essen-
tially homeless. You can
only get that by speaking
to people.
Simone Weil wrote that
“the love of our neighbor
in all its fullness simply
means being able to say,
‘What are you going
through?’” Now, I’m no
Simone Weil, but I want
Felix to have the same
viewpoint (although
maybe without the early
death): we’re here for you,
to represent your voice and
your views, to challenge
College and the Union on
your behalf. But for this
to happen, you’ll have to
let us know about it. Until
then, I’ll be here, chained
to the West Basement’s
one working computer.
Imperial improves in PRES results, but continuing
problems with PhD funding are highlighted

The Postgraduate
Research Experience
Survey results were
better than 2015’s,
but reflect issues
with supervision and
funding.
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
I
mperial College
Union responded
to the Postgraduate
Research Experi-
ence Survey (PRES)
this week. The results
indicate an improvement
on 2015’s results, but
issues with supervision
and funding continue.
Imperial reported an
increase in average scores
across all question sectors
since the last PRES, with
seven of ten sectors being
above or equal to the na-
tional average. However,
some sectors highlighted
issues research postgrad-
uates face: supervision,
in particular, scored the
furthest below the UK
average, with 83% of
Imperial students satisfied,
compared to 86% nation-
ally. The Dyson School
of Design Engineering,
Centre for Environmental
Policy (CEP), and the
Imperial College Business
School (ICBS) all scored
significantly below the
Imperial average for su-
pervision, which includes
skills and knowledge of
supervisors, as well as the
amount of contact students
have with them.
Imperial College
Union identified this as a
particular issue, noting:
“Many students report that
they do not have regular
meetings with their super-
visor. Furthermore, some
supervisors do not respond
to emails.”
One student Felix spoke
to, who is in their final
year of a PhD, said: “My
supervisor is really bad
Another student
Felix spoke to, who has
just finished their PhD,
confirmed that financial
pressures caused a large
psychological burden:
“While Imperial is having
a push away from three-
year funding, funding
was still a huge issue for
me. When mine ran out,
I was unable to pay rent,
and experienced ‘hidden
homelessness’ while I
stayed on friends’ sofas.”
The London Assembly
Housing Committee re-
cently estimated that 10%
of people would experi-
ence hidden homelessness
in any year, causing a large
amount of mental strain.
“For about six months,”
the student told us, “I
didn’t have my own place,
and the stress meant I was
completely paralysed in
terms of working.”
In their response – con-
taining recommendations
that they say “if met, will
make a meaningful differ-
ence to everyone working
towards their PhD” – the
Union highlighted that
“some students are unable
to complete their pro-
grammes due to financial
difficulties”, and said
these pressures place “an
unnecessary burden on
student”, affecting both
welfare and work quality.
The PRES also revealed
departmental variation:
the Department of Aero-
nautical Engineering, for
example, scored below
the Imperial average on
nearly all metrics. The
ICBS also fared poorly,
with all scores below the
Imperial College average;
particular issues were
opportunities – with only
50% of students feeling
they had enough chance
to develop – and overall
satisfaction, with 2/3 of
students feeling satisfied
with their experience.
The CEP was another
department that performed
poorly, with five of their
sector scores being the
lowest across all de-
partments. Only 36% of
students felt satisfied with
the research culture, and
half were satisfied with
their overall experience,
compared with a College
average of 81%.
In contrast, a number
of departments scored
very well, with the Crick
Institute, the Depart-
ments of Computing and
Mechanical Engineering,
and the Institute of
Clinical Sciences all
reporting above average
scores across a number of
domains.
Imperial scored particu-
larly highly on resource
availability, with an 88%
satisfaction rate compared
to81%nationally.Students
generally felt they were
provided with enough to
do their research, although
the response did identify
feedback was not valued”.
Scores were particularly
low in in the Department
of Aeronautical Engineer-
ing (66%), and the CEP
(62%).
In a statement to Felix,
Nick Burstow, Deputy
President (Education),
said: “The Union has pro-
duced its latest Response
to the biennial PRES, part
of our ongoing commit-
ment to speaking up for our
members by influencing
College’s decision-mak-
ing at the highest levels.
It was the quickest and
earliest PRES Response
we’ve ever produced,
meaning we have already
begun lobbying on behalf
of our members to senior
Members of College, right
from the start of the aca-
demic year.”
A spokesperson from
the College told Felix:
“We are determined to
make sure the College is
the very best place it can be
for our students. We take
feedback from students
seriously...Departmental
action plans in response to
the survey, developed in
consultation with student
reps, will be finalised over
the coming weeks.”
A number of student reported concerns about funding their PhDs // Creative Commons
“Completion
rates revealed
the issues
with funding
that affect a
significant
number of
students”
Imperial was above the
UK average, there was
wide variation, with
ICBS having the lowest
completion rate, of 71%.
A number of students said
financial pressures play a
large role in completion.
“A lot of PhDs in my
department get funding
for 3.5 years, but are
pressured into continuing
experiments for the full
four years,” one student
told us. “It creates a lot of
stress when your super-
visor wants you to gather
more data at the risk of be-
coming homeless without
extra funding.”
“Imperial
College Union
identified
supervision
as a partiular
issue”
support for a postgraduate
social space. Student
opinion of their depart-
ment’s ‘Responsibilities’,
which covers whether
they felt their feedback
was valued, showed wide
variation, with the Union
reporting there was “a
clear frustration from
those who felt that their
with feedback, especially
before deadlines. I asked
him numerous times to
look at my early stage
assessment report, which
was 70 pages long, but
I only received his com-
ments a few hours before
submission. Colleagues
have had similar experi-
ences, which led to sleep-
less nights and working on
the weekend”
A spokesperson from
the College told Felix that
they have “already taken
action to enhance and
develop the supervisory
experience of research
students”, putting in place
“improvements to poli-
cies” and the opportunity
for anonymous feedback.
