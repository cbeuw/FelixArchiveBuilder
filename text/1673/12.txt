THE LADY FROM THE
SEA
The Lady from the Sea: An adaptation worth its salt?
We travel to the Caribbean by way of the Donmar Warehouse for a refreshing take on one of Ibsen’s later works.
D
irected by
K w a m e
Kwei-Armah
– the British
actor-cum-playwright and
soon to be artistic director
of the Young Vic – The
Lady from the Sea tells a
story of marital oppression
and lost love. Calypso
music plays and algae
grows from the walls as
Kwei-Armah relocates the
play from 19th Century
Norway to a tourist haven
in the Caribbean. Here we
find Ellida, the lighthouse
keeper’s daughter; though
her situation is anything
but idyllic.
Ellida (Nikki Amu-
ka-Bird) is the second
wife of doctor Wangel
(Finbar Lynch), serving
as stepmother to his two
daughters. Her mental
state appears to be dete-
riorating, and her daily
morning swims in the
lagoon are becoming
something of a compul-
sion. Wangel writes to the
former tutor of his oldest
daughter and childhood
friend of his wife, in the
hope that a visit from
a familiar figure will
bring back the woman he
married. We learn Ellida is
haunted by a teenage fling
with a seaman to whom
she became ‘engaged’
before he was forced to
flee. His power remains
over her, forging a gap
between her and the doctor
until he returns to fetch his
mermaid bride.
Amuka-Bird gives an
evocative performance
of the glassy-eyed Ellida.
She appears serene yet
stifled, creating the
perfect level of distance
between her and the other
characters, most notably
her husband. Although
the tale is centred around
her struggles, she does
not dominate the stage,
allowing the other players
to hold their own. Lynch
complements this with his
portrayal of the devoted
doctor. He cossets his
wife and seeks a cure for
her detachment like one
would a clinical indisposi-
tion, when we can all see
that the only medicine she
requires is freedom. Ellida
is shackled by her wedding
rings, to both Wangel
and her absent mariner,
and thus is left mercurial.
The audience is forced
to consider marriage as a
form of oppression and
duty, a way for men to
keep their women at bay.
Subplots are allowed
to develop yet remain
self-effacing, bringing in
elements of tragicomedy
as the tutor confuses the
‘woman waiting’ for him
described in the doctor’s
letter with his ex-pupil,
and proposes to her. We
laugh at the cliché love-
veiled-with-hate romance
between the younger
daughter Hilde – reem-
ployed by Ibsen four years
later in The Master Builder
– and a travelling tortured
artiste. Ellie Bamber does
an excellent job as the
pouting teenager, cruelly
mocking the man she is
clearly mad for (think Cher
and Josh in Clueless). We
enjoy to despise her target,
the struggling sculptor
Lyngstad (Jonny Holden),
as his slapstick self-assur-
ance provides a breath of
fresh air from the melan-
choly of the main plot.
Writer Elinor Cook’s
sophisticated revamp of
the text – originally written
by Henrik Ibsen in 1888 –
to the 1950s works almost
seamlessly. This is helped
largely by Ibsen’s progres-
sive humanism and use of
strong female characters
which drove the play
ahead of its time. Cook
and Kwei-Armah keep
a good balance between
bourgeois realism and the
sea shanty mythology of
the original fable. It must
be said, however, that what
seemed like a constant
rotation of two people on
stage at once, combined
with sometimes-forced
conversations and
received pronunciation,
did leave me feeling like
I was watching an episode
of Made In Chelsea.
The location shift to the
Caribbean post-colonisa-
tion does bring rise to a
discussion unintended by
the original Norwegian
text. We are unaware if
we should pay attention
to the casting choice of a
black woman for Ellida,
juxtaposed with the
uniform fairness of the
(apparently) expat family
she has married into. This
suspicion is reinforced
later when Ellida’s es-
tranged lover appears,
sharing her darker skin
tone. Their shift from
affected elocution to an
Antillean lilt when caught
in a moment of passion
does feel slightly heavy
handed, implying race to
be a contributing factor
to Ellida’s isolation, but
wisely Kwei-Armah does
not let this encroach any
further.
In trademark Donmar
style the terraqueous set
is simplistic but smart;
a fish tank of rocks and
submerged play boats are
utilised to represent both
the sea and the murky
lagoon. The rest of Tom
Scutt’s scenery consists of
only a mossy brick wall
and slightly damp odour,
subtly lit to provide an
eerie tension at just the
right moments. At times it
seemed like cast members
were going for a paddle
purely for the sake of it,
but personally this didn’t
dampen the impact of the
performance.
At 100 minutes long
with no interval the play
seemed to steamroll ahead,
leaving little time to get
bored with overdramatics
or flamboyant language.
An unpretentious produc-
tion with melancholy un-
dertones softened by a few
giggles, The Lady from the
Sea takes you on a trip to
the seaside but doesn’t go
too deep.
