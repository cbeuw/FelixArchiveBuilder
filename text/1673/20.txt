LICE
Retouch portrays an
Iranian housewife’s fight
against daily oppression
in a deeply disturbing and
callous way. From the
beginning she is dismissed
and condescended to by
her husband, who sees her
as a commodity destined
to do his bidding. In the
morning, whilst doing
barbell chest-presses in
their bedroom, he acci-
dently puts on too much
weight and the bar drops
onto his neck brutally
With unconvincing
acting and a terrible
script, Slap Happy was
unquestionably the worst
from the series. The film
Lice explores the psy-
chological and emotional
conflict that exists within
a child during a messy
parental breakup. The film
is shot at late evening in
an Israeli apartment and
details a young girl un-
dergoing the gruesomely
uncomfortable procedure
of being deloused by her
frazzled mother whilst
her (freshly-divorced)
father invites her to come
for ice-cream by shouting
from the street. Intensely
aggressive exchanges
erupt between the mother
and father and the young
girl becomes caught in the
middle of the crossfire.
Her mother eventually
gives her the ultimatum
and lets her make the
decision of whom to stay
with, placing the girl in
state of confusion, over-
whelmed by two forces
that love her and hate each

we witness an eclectic
range of traumatic love
experiences. Regardless
of your race, religion, sex-
uality, or nationality you
are guaranteed to relate to
at least one of the stories
on a profoundly personal
basis. Here are some of the
highlights:

The wife serves as both
an anti-hero, fighting
against male patriarchy,
and as a cold sociopath
who refuses to help the
father of her child as he
dies in front of her. There
is very little dialogue and
no music during any of the
scenes creating a deeply
eerie and unnerving at-
mosphere. Middle-Eastern
film is relatively uncharted
waters for most people in
the West, and thus this fas-
cinating critique of Iranian
society was undoubtedly
one of most memorable
and thought-provoking
films from the series.

follows a mid-twenties
professional couple
who are at point in their
relationship of no bound-
aries. The opening scene
involved the girlfriend
poking fun at her lover
by continually referring
to him as “gay” for being
offended at something
trivial, and by the end she
slaps him in a fit of anger
“One word

whilst they are having an
argument. The girlfriend’s
character is centred around
the concept of gender-role
reversal in modern
relationships (see the
abysmal Amy Schumer’s
Trainwreck if you need
an explanation), where a
woman adopts tradition-
ally male attributes. Gen-
erally, this role-reversal is
associated with a feminist
message and promotes the
importance of strength and
independence in women;
however the female
character in Slap Happy is
portrayed as homophobic,
obnoxious, and physically
violent. The male actor
had a very pale baby
face which was boringly
unresponsive throughout.
One scene involves the
girlfriend describing some
very obscene fantasies
to her lover during sex,
but all this created was
the feeling that the writer
tried to throw in as many
‘shock-factor’ lines as
possible. All-in-all one
word perfectly sums up

brilliant throughout; her

illustrates how difficult
and bleak life can be in
working-class Glasgow
and British by the Grace
of God deals with the idea
of duplicity and removing
yourself from the harsh
realities of the city. This
film focuses on a typical
loyalist family in the heart
of Glasgow and begins
with the father (an Or-
angeman) preparing for a
standard day of marching
by putting on his sash,
singing “God-Save the
Queen”, and talking about
immigrants in a derogato-
ry way. On the surface he
is the archetypical strong
Protestant Glaswegian
man; however his fetish
involves dressing up like a
baby whilst his wife feeds
him milk from a bottle and
cradles him in her arms,
illustrating his profound
vulnerabilities and obscure
sexual comforts. His wife
is initially portrayed as an
all-serving stay at home
mum who is totally loyal
to her husband and son;
however she displays
deep-seeded deceitfulness
as she coldly cheats on

who displays his true and

the film he remains in his

his anger and his wish to

reality of his home life;
he ultimately commits
suicide, ending the film on
an extremely dark note.
