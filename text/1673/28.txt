I
t was a dreary
Wednesday after-
noon, and a crowd
of chilly-looking
runners were gathering in
Beit Quad, sporting dis-
tinctive navy and red vests
rather than the gowns and
mortarboards donned by
a large proportion of the
graduatingstudentsaround
campus. That could only
mean one thing: it must
be the start of another year
and another cross-country
season filled with mud,
sweat, and beers. And
cake.
The first challenge
facing the squad of 70 was
navigating the London
Underground to reach
cross-country Mecca:
Parliament Hill. After
some confusion getting
the correct Tube line and
Oyster card top-up-related
delays, the team made
it back above ground at
Belsize Park and com-
pleted the remainder of
the journey on foot. They
arrived in good time
before the starting gun,
leaving the freshers and
new members plenty of
time to ogle at the size of
the challenging hill that
faced them from the start
line. After some brief
warming-up, an obligatory
pre-race team photo taken
by a rival team captain,
and plenty of toilet stops,
the squad headed for the
start line at the base of the
mammoth Mount Parly
Hill.
The race organiser’s
instructions were barely
audible after chants of
“I-C-X-C” broke out
amongst the Imperial
ranks, and another slightly
“Yeah, it’s time
for a big pull-
quote. We love
these things,
but don’t
forget to make
them short!”
“After the
valiant athletes
had regained
their breath,
the cake
bingeing soon
began”
more explicit ode started
up amongst the team
of King’s College. Yet
without much further ado
the race was underway
with a short blast on a
whistle, and the shouts and
songs of the athletes gave
way to the rapid thuds of
260 pairs of athletic legs
ascending the rather steep
slope. Having donned the
notorious home-made
“King of the Hill” T-shirt,
ICXC-fresher Robbie
Holland took on the tradi-
tion of racing to the top of
the hill, and impressively
made it up in 2nd place!
He later went on to remark
that the athlete who
beat him to the summit
managed to maintain the
ridiculous pace whilst Rob
himself struggled around
the remaining 8km at a
considerably slower speed
than the initial surge.
Once at the peak, the
race leaders struggled to
follow the questionable
signage but after a short
diversion around some
minor foliage they were
back on track, zooming
down the grassy tracks,
across the barren heath-
land and through muddy
ditches. Corner-cutting
was rife, but as any expe-
rienced racer knows: if a
marshal doesn’t see it; it
didn’t happen. The course
was a newly refined
version of the route from
previous years, with the
girls completing 2 gruel-
ling laps of the park and
the boys undertaking an
even more gruelling 3.
In the Men’s race of
146, star performer Chris
Olley led the way home in
just under 29 minutes, and
was reasonably closely
followed by Chris Thomas
in 5th place, and club
favourite Harry Scriven in
9th place. Oliver Newton
placed 18th and Daniel
Ayers had no problems
competing against his
alma matter King’s, finish-
ing in 25th and rounding
off Imperial’s A team. This
placed the team in 2nd
place in the league and just
3 points behind Brunel in
1st, but more importantly
14 points ahead of arch-ri-
vals UCL (who currently
sit in the bronze medal
position). In the Women’s
race of 113, Sarah Johnson
breezed to 2nd place in
22:24, followed by Kate
Olding in 5th, Women’s
Captain Anna in 9th and
highest-ranking fresher
Georgia Curry in 10th.
Unsurprisingly, with all 4
team members in the top
10, the Women’s A team
now sit top of the league,
rest of the squad to a
sprint finish and regained
their breath, the cake
bingeing soon began. The
first baking session of the
season was of a very high
calibre, with top quality
baked goods brought from
all corners of the club
from freshers to finalists.
For the post race socials
the squad’s thoughts ini-
tially remained with food;
heading to the local GBK
to the joy of the manager
(who made the team pose
through an Instagram
frame without offering
sponsorship). After filling
their stomachs to satis-
faction, thoughts quickly
turned to sourcing refresh-
ing beverages, with the
team meeting at Acton’s
finest bowling alley for a
couple of games of skittles
and more than a couple of
the aforementioned beers
to celebrate a thoroughly
successful start to the
cross-country season.
The next race in the
LUCA XC League is on 1st
November, meeting in Beit
Quad at 1pm. For more

11 points ahead of UCL.
Imperial’s B team finished
3rd and just one point
ahead of King’s in 4th.
Perhaps more impressive-
ly still, Imperial fielded
more runners in both the
boys (36) and girls (30)
race than any other uni-
versity!
