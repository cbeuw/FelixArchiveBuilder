Miracle material could bring an end to cracked
smartphone screens

iPhone may be made shatter-proof.

I
t looks like a dream,
but it’s real,” says
Dr Elton Santos,
a researcher from
Queen’s University
Belfast’s School of
Mathematics and Physics.
Santos has led an interna-
tional team of scientists
to create a new miracle
material, one that could be
used to make crack-free
smartphone screens and
self-charging devices.
By combining su-
per-thin and stable
graphene with a substance
known as hexagonal boron
nitride (hBN) and a semi-
conductor called C60
, the
team were able to create a
brand new material that is
more durable and cheaper
than current materials on
the market like silicon.
“It’s almost impossible
to pick one material with
all the properties you
want,” explains Santos.
“I came up with the
idea that if you combine
materials with different
purposes then maybe you
can create a new solid. So
you combine these 3 ma-
terials and you could get
completely new or novel
features.”
So how does one go
about creating a material
from scratch? “To me
it’s like you are in a very
sunny place, like a sunny
Spain or sunny Malaga,
and you look up at the sky
and there’s nothing there,”
says Santos. “I got the idea
and then the theory and
“As well as
making more
durable
screens, the
material could
allow smart
devices to
become solar
powered”
“When
might this
material reach
smartphones?
Elton Santos
reckons it’s not
too far away”
then did simulations. After
several months those sim-
ulations worked well so
then I suggested to a few
colleagues in Berkeley
and Stanford to try to
make it and they did – that
simple!”
“One of the appli-
cations that people got
very excited about was
essentially to try to replace
some of the components
you have in the iPhone,
for instance,” he adds.
“In several of the iPhones
they use different kinds of
glass, kinds of sapphire
glasses, or other kinds of
polymers. Those polymers
or those glasses are ex-
pensive and very fragile
but if you replaced some
of those components, and
then include the material,
you could get so many
features and one of those
is unbreakable screens.”
As well as making
more durable screens, the
new material could allow
smartphones and smart
devices to become solar
powered and therefore
rechargeable on the go.
“We thought let’s create
a material that harvests
energy and solar elec-
tricity and then you can
just charge your battery
while you just drink your
beer in Piccadilly,” says
Santos. “You can catalyse
the electric current in the
battery so you connect
the screen to the battery.
I know prototypes in the
market with different ma-
terials that are doing that.
So it’s not far away from
reality at the moment.”
However one potential
problem with a wide-
spread use of graphene and
graphene-based materials
is possible effects on our
health. Only discovered
in 2004, the toxicity of
graphene is still under
investigation.
“Potentially it could
be harmful,” explains
graphene expert Professor
Owen Guy, Director of
the Centre for Nanohealth
at Swansea University’s
College of Engineering.
“Types of graphene which
are particulate could po-
tentially get into the body
more easily, and there is
the possibility there could
be toxic as with carbon na-
notubes but I think there’s
probably not enough data
or enough studies on that
yet.”
In terms of environ-
mental impacts, using
graphene on a large scale
should be safe. “You know
graphene’s organic,” notes
Santos, “it’s a carbon
material, so I would say
essentially it’s environ-
mentally friendly.”
Whilst the new material
has huge potential, it still
needs tweaking before it
can be put into use as it
lacks an essential feature
known as the band gap.
The band gap is needed
to give electronics like
smartphones an on-off
switching function.
“Graphene is what they
call a 0 band gap semicon-
ductor,” explains Guy. “In
a normal semiconductor
you have what they call
a band gap between the
valence band, the band
which contains electrons,
and the conductor band,
the empty band. In order
to get conduction you
have to have either a hole
or electrons and they
have to be able to flow.
In pure pristine graphene
there is no gap between
the valence band and the
conduction band but when
you modify it in some way
then you can introduce a
band gap.”
Santos and his team are
already working on poten-
tial solutions. “The idea
now is trying to replace
graphene with other mate-
rials,” he says, “materials
that are still flat and still
2D but with a band gap. So
there are several materials
now that we are looking
into like the transition
metal dichalcogenides.”
So when might this new
material reach our smart-
phones? Santos reckons
its application isn’t too
far away. “If you think
in terms of time frame it
can easily take between
five to seven years,” he
says. “I think that it will
not take too long to use
this kind of prototype,
this new material that we
discovered.”
