The Hydra x Barbican present: Gas + Huerco S.
A
nother night,
another gig.
This time at
the temple of
austere, brutalist beauty
that is the Barbican. If
you’re a fan of ambient
music, this venue is a must
– the sculpted wood of the
concert hall reverberates
with thick, earthy noise,
immersing and inducing
you into a trance-like
state. The perfect setting
to witness an artist like
Gas.
Gas is the most famous
project of electronic
musician Wolfgang Voigt,
co-founder of revered
Cologne label Kompakt
and a key player in
Germany’s ambient and
minimal techno scenes.
Over the years, Voigt has
produced music under
many monikers: although
projects such as Mike
Ink and Studio 1 had
undeniable influence on
four-to-the-floor dance-
floor techno, Gas remains
his most enduring project
to date. Armed with the
aortic throb of kick drums
and the disorienting whirl
was unleashed.
Gas’ set was preceded
by Huerco S., fresh on
the heels of For Those
Of You Who Have Never
(And Also Those Who
Have), perhaps the best
ambient release of last
year. Huerco S. has fused
Gas’ idiosyncrasies with
more conventional techno
to create warm looping
textures with glitchy clicks
and soft hisses. He has a
unique talent for making
music that, despite not
being designed for clubs,
captures a distanced,
glazed view of the club
feeling. Like most 90s
ambient, it is music for
the chill-out room, for the
comedown.
Following a brief
interval, Voigt appeared
on stage. Like a delicate
rustling of leaves, he
slowly unveiled his synths
and rumbles; these grew
with the introduction of
hypnotic melodies which
gradually became more
chaotic and harder to
follow, all the while a
fairy-light forest project-
ing behind him. The noise
continued to develop until
it swallowed the room.
Suddenly, the thud of a
heartbeat leapt into the
undergrowth. This basic
model is at the core of
all of Gas’ music, and
After about an hour the
journey was over. Voigt
left the stage immediately
despite what appeared to
be a stagehand advising
him to stand in the spot-
light for applause. He may
now be playing interna-
tionally regarded concert
halls, but he is still the
king of Cologne under-
ground at heart. Shunning
individual recognition,
hiding behind a variety of
monikers, and producing
otherworldly music. This
is ambient music at its
best. A sonic cathedral,
within which you can’t
help but worship.
St. John Sessions: Laurel Halo and Lee Gamble
H
yperdub is odd.
It’s always been
odd. But it has
knitted itself so
tightly into the fabric of
London’s musical culture
that when two of its artists
play experimental sets in
an 18th century church, it
somehow feels perfectly
natural.
I arrived at the St. John
Church in Hackney to
find a substantial crowd
already present, framed in
moonlight emanating from
a majestic stained glass
window. It was the perfect
setting for Laurel Halo’s
transcendental blend of
pop, techno, and jazz. Halo
appeared on stage with
percussionist and sound
artist Eli Keszler in tow,
placing herself behind an
electronics-lathered table
while Keszler took to a
small drum kit.
The set consisted
mostly of songs from her
superb 2017 release Dust
– although the album cuts
had been bent almost un-
recognisably out of shape.
Halo sculpted electronic
landscapes with punchy
programmed drums,
bottomless bass-lines and
sublime synths. Keszler
provided an erratic yet
conscientious jazz percus-
sion, utilising thin sticks
and brushes to produce
gentle textures, clashing
with Halo’s overwhelming
noisy flourishes in all the
right ways. On album cuts
‘From Sun to Solar’ and
‘Jelly’, voice manipula-
tion software transformed
Halo’s poetic speak-sing-
ing into shimmering
undulations around the
cavernous room.
Describing Halo’s
current output is not so
straightforward. Although
the blissed-out reverb
and dub techno basslines
from previous releases are
undoubtedly present, cate-
gorising what was played
across the hour-long set is
nigh on impossible. Laurel
Halo has proved herself to
be a truly unique talent in
electronic music; she is
her own genre.
The stark contrast
between Halo’s near-per-
fect performance and the
following set from Lee
Gamble was mildly upset-
ting. The London-based
producer’s Diversions
That’s What I Call UK
Bass”. Gamble’s dark,
Caribbean-inspired cuts,
for which he’s loved, were
refreshing in a time where
dancehall and Reggaeton
had been saturated with
musicians with both eyes
on that ‘One Dance’ cash.
However, the ambient and
DnB pieces he spewed
(between puffs of his vape)
on this evening were less
impressive, and seemed to
misjudge the venue’s vibe.
The consistent quality
of Hyperdub releases
is a result of the label’s
boldness to explore
unknown quarters of
electronic music, without
regard for the existence
of an obvious audience.
Though they may not
hit the mark on every
occasion, if they continue
to put on events as auda-
cious as this, their impres-
sive reputation will only
continue to thrive.

Narkopop was Gas’first new album in 17 years // Kompakt
“The sculpted
wood of the
concert hall
reverberates
with thick,
earthy noise”
of synths, Voigt aimed to
“bring the German forest
to the disco”. And at the
Barbican, still reeling from
the critically acclaimed
release of Narkopop (the
first Gas album in 17
years), this fantasy world
“Like a delicate
rustling of
leaves, Voight,
aka Gas, slowly
unveiled his
synths and
rumbles”
yet never fades into the
background. Gas deviates
from Eno’s mantra: it is
ambient music which is
unignorable.
“The stark
contrast
between Halo’s
near-perfect
performance
and the
following
set from
Lee Gamble
was mildly
upsetting”
1994-1996 remains a
fantastic love letter to the
90s Jungle scene, whereas

Laurel Halo, kicking around the dustbowl // Hyperdub
Nai Palm strikes out on her
own
Mura Masa’s debut shows
he’s one to watch
S
inger, songwriter,
and guitarist Nai
Palm has come out
with her debut solo
album, Needle Paw: an in-
timate collection of covers
and originals wrapped in
rich harmonies that gives
a slightly new perspective
on her already established
compositions, as well as
introducing some new
and more personal ones.
Better known as the lead
singer of Hiatus Kaiyote
(the Australian group
known for their soulful,
slightly jazzy vibes, and
possibly being the tightest
band around today), she
has stepped away from
the comfort of her band
to bare her husky voice
in a much more personal
setting.
Nai Palm’s influences
explain the slightly-off
rhythms and her vo-
cal-heavy style, which can
at first feel a bit jarring.
It’s her eclectic taste in
music which has led to
her eclectic style. The
influence of Latin and
West African rhythms is
apparent through most
of her songs, leading to
the not-quite-normal 4/4
feel, and melody lines
picking up seemingly
from out of the blue. A
focus on intricate vocal
melodies derives from her
love for Saharan music,
with singers like Oumou
Sangare inspiring her
vocalisations. It’s amazing
how natural it comes to
her as well; her guitar
playing – which can get a
little messy – rhythmically
flows naturally against
the constantly-changing
directions of her songs,
matching her powerful
and fluid voice.
In this album, the guitar
is used less as the focus of
harmony, more providing
small cross-rhythms and
short melodic riffs behind
the close, thick vocal parts.
The guitar playing is very
bass heavy, giving context
to her harmonies and
simple rhythms to mess
around on top of. These
harmonies, which are the
most impressive aspect
of the album, are done
quite tastefully; to get a
venerable sound along-
side her more personal
lyrics on a song such as
‘Homebody’, she’ll leave
her voice exposed for the
whole line - just as she’s
about to ease out of it, the
other vocal lines creep in,
as if to reassure herself.
Other times she’ll build up
the harmonies enough that
her lead part only slightly
rides above, dipping in and
out of the many layers in
an almost overwhelming
flood of voices, as heard
at the end of ‘Crossfire/So
into you’.
My only issue with
this album is that Hiatus
Kaiyote’s Choose your
Weapon, from which most
of the covers come, is a lot
more complete and holds
many more interesting
details musically than this
one. And to be fair, the
whole album could appear
a bit self-conceited; it
pretty much replicates
her existing work, but
now with three fewer
people. However, Needle
Paw is more for herself
and her fans, giving us
an introspective take on
her already established
compositions. I can
imagine that this is how
she hears her songs in her
head, millions of beautiful
voices piled on top of each
other, constantly changing
their direction. And even
in a stripped back form,
the songs hold power
under her unaccompanied,
masterful control.
So overall I’m happy
with what she’s come out
with, and can’t wait for
Nai Palm to drop even
more fire.
M
ura Masa’s
s e l f - t i t l e d
debut album
is a refresh-
ing display of what our
generation has to offer.
The Guernsey-born DJ
started making tunes from
his bedroom and came
onto the radar when he
released his song ‘Lotus
Eater’ on Soundcloud in
2014. Although he has
only just turned 21 he has
since collaborated with the
likes of Stormzy, A$AP
Rocky, Charli XCX, and
the lead singer of the
Gorillaz, Damon Albarn,
just to name a few.
The album starts out
with a sample taken from
a tube stop announcement
and then jumps to the
first song ‘Messy Love.’
Throughout the album,
you’re met with several
different styles and genres,
so it is difficult to catego-
rise his music. Mura Masa
does not shy away from
using unconventional
instruments like the steel
drum, harp, or flute, which
makes the music pretty
cool. Instead of adhering to
a single genre, Mura Masa
uses a blend of genres to
create a distinct electronic
sound, setting him apart
from the competition; he
is one of the first artists
from our generation, and
he doesn’t adhere to old
conventions. Fellow audi-
ophiles will agree that we
aren’t limited to our record
collections anymore but
can listen to anything we
want, and I believe this is
manifested in his style.
I also want to touch on
the fact that Mura Masa
has some sick album art.
I respect a man with a
good Instagram, and Mura
Masa’s is peng.
‘1 Night’ describes
Charli XCX’s one night
stand with a boy, with
whom she doesn’t want
to have a relationship.
Asking if their relationship
could go back to where it
was before they had sex,
she sings “It was only one
night / But I wanna go
back to where we were”.
In contrast to ‘What if I
go?’, where Bonzai sings
quite literally the opposite.
Mura Masa’s collabo-
ration with famous rapper
A$AP Rocky, ‘Love$ick’,
is the most popular song
on the album. A$AP’s
accompanying rap creates
a balanced match for
Love$ick’s Caribbean-in-
fluenced style, together
with Mura Masa’s signa-
ture bass drops, which will
have your hips shaking in
no time.
Overall, the album is a
tribute to what it means
to be young these days.
A glaring shout to pursue
happiness through sex,
friendship, and just not
caring too much about
things. This kid is making
some serious waves and it
will be worth keeping an
eye on him over the next
few years.
