Dystopian sci-fi is absolutely necessary
Comment Editor Charles Titmuss argues that dystopian futures are vital, even in our modern age, as they allow us
to prepare for a possibly-terrible future.

I
n an article published
last week, the current
TV Editor proposed
that the dystopian
futures shown in contem-
porary sci-fi are no longer
necessary, for a wide range
of reasons. I disagree: the
purpose of this article is
to highlight instead the
value of these forms of
entertainment, especially
in the present day.
Sci-fi as a genre is suc-
cessful when it anticipates
the social impact of tech-
nological developments
on humanity. The article
last week made the point
that currently, TV shows
such as Black Mirror
are too close to reality to
be valuable in that role.
On the contrary, the fact
that these programmes
can predict the potential
horrors of the near future
so accurately perfectly
describes their necessity.
If a piece of media allows
for the discussion about
a future technology or its
use, then that is an incredi-
bly valuable function.
The author also seems
to propose that reality
is already much worse
than posited within Black
Mirror, or any dystopian
sci-fi, particularly with
respect to misinformation,
or to quote someone
famous: “Fake News”.
I would disagree again
with the specific points
the article makes, in that I
believe economic inequal-
ity and lack of opportunity,
coupled with an effective
election strategy that
actually targeted young
people as opposed to ne-
glecting them, contributed
to the large rise in political
engagement.
Fake news has always
been a problem, ever
since the ability to identify
with and spread ideas was
invented. The problem
is not with technology, it
is with people’s need to
self-validate their ideas,
a point which the article
makes. Social media does
give increased access to
other communities that
share similar views, but
when I was researching
the impact of social
media and the internet
on terrorism in the UK, I
came across information
that suggested that it was
the physical social group
that truly drove their
warped views forward. I
am not saying that this can
necessarily be applied to
other ideological groups,
but certainly I think that
by attributing these issues
solely to social media, we
miss a significant portion
of the problem.
The article goes on to
reference classic dysto-
pias, such as the Matrix
that individualism is an
irrelevant philosophy.
Choices mean nothing
in the face of a powerful
state, caste, or organi-
sation using technology
to engineer the perfect
societal succession. This
is best represented in 1984
or Brave New World, one
exploring the impact of
terror and surveillance to
keep people in order, the
other relying on genetical-
ly engineered castes and
the happiness drug soma.
These two novels
underline the narrative
and philosophical value
of dystopian sci-fi. It
allows the author to place
characters in a context
completely alien to us and
examine their reactions. It
forces us to compare our
current values with those
of another hypothetical
social order, that is not
interested in the good of
the individual. That is the
true horror of dystopian
sci-fi: it forces us to come
to terms with the answers
to awful questions, such as
1984’s what is love when
compared to pain, or Brave
New World’s unsettling
vision of a society where
happiness is universal,
but freedom is extinct. In
the end we must love Big
Brother, or swallow our
soma tablet.
I think the article’s point
about optimism when it
comes to technology is
well founded: it is impor-
tant not to be too pessimis-
tic about technology, as
some of the advances have
the potential to improve
our lives. I, however, am a
pessimist and believe that
as much as something has
the potential to improve,
it also has the potential to
destroy. Whenever tech-
nology advances a large
amount, an economic rev-
olution occurs, changing
the established order. This
in turn renders some jobs
extinct. This occurred
during the industrial rev-
olution with the extinction
of the European cottage
industry, and is occurring
now with the increased
automation of the work-
place. The net result is
greater wealth for those
that own the machines
and the methods of their
manufacture, and destitu-
tion and poverty for those
whose livelihoods are
destroyed. A question that
no one currently has an
answer to is how exactly
society and capitalism
will function when 80%,
90%, or even 95% of
individuals don’t have a
job due to AI? Is democ-
racy a feasible system of
government in the face of
an elite that possesses all
of the wealth as opposed
to merely most of it? Is
there a point in maintain-
ing a large population of
essentially useless mouths
for those that possess this
vast wealth?
To conclude, there
are big questions to be
answered about our future,
the role that technology
will play, and how our
society will adapt to it. If
we believe that the values
we currently hold dear
are important to pass on
to future generations,
dystopias must be a part
of the current media
environment so that we
can properly anticipate the
challenges that the future
will bring. Dystopias do
not provide answers to
these questions, but they
make us realise no matter
how bad things are, they
can always get worse.
We must fight to keep the
world the way we want it
to be.

“As much as
technology has
the potential
to improve, it
also has the
potential to
destroy”
or, my personal favourite,
1984. Exploring the differ-
ences between these two
dystopias results in the
consideration that there
are two kinds of dystopia:
the first type are mostly
self-satisfying stories,
with examples including
The Hunger Games, or the
film Elysium. They give
into the illusion an individ-
ual’s choices are important
in the face of a seemingly
all-powerful state or AI
that inexplicably has a
fundamental weakness. A
true dystopia, for me at
least, is the absolute horror
of the Western World:
