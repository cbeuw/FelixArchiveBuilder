Gene Drives –Atechnology capable of changing entire
species
An emerging technology may allow us to play God, but should we take the risk? More importantly, can we afford
not to?

G
ene drive tech-
nology allows
humans to intro-
duce genetical
modifications to species
that are always passed on
to the next generation,
which allows a character-
istic to become prevalent
in a species over very few
generations. The technolo-
gy is powerful enough to
wipe out whole species,
and has applications in
eliminating invasive
species, and controlling
vector-borne diseases. The
technology is showing
promise, and it has at-
tracted huge investments.
Bill Gates, for example,
has invested a total of $75
million in Target Malaria,
a consortium led by
Imperial College aiming
to control the spread of
malaria. Gene drives are
to be used for this purpose,
specifically one to make
female mosquitoes sterile
to eliminate the mosquito
population.
Gene drives have been
made possible by the
development of CRISPR/
Cas9, a powerful and
precise genetic engineer-
ing tool. So how does a
gene drive work? A gene
drive contains a guide
RNA which directs it to
the right place along the
chromosome, then Cas9
cuts the gene and the cell
repairs the damage by
copying the gene drive
into the cut site. This
means the gene drive is
present in both copies of
a gene (both will have
the gene drive allele).
with the gene drive in
both copies of the gene.
A desired characteristic
can be encoded within the
gene drive to be passed on.
Gene drives can help
solve a range of problems.
As discussed earlier, they
could stop a range of
diseases such as malaria,
dengue, and Lyme by
altering insects. In the case
of mosquitoes, the possible
alterations include making
mosquitoes resistant to the
malaria parasite, making
mosquitoes sterile, and
making them less inter-
ested in humans as prey.
Gene drives could also
help eliminate invasive
species (such as carps,
whose adaptability allows
them to wreak havoc in
ecosystems all around
the world). Whole popu-
lations can be eliminated
if the gene drive encodes
for gender (for example
making all offspring
male). Gene drives could
also be used in weeds
to reverse resistance to
pesticides, which can help
increase crop yields.
Indeed, gene drives
could save lives and
improve ecosystems, but
should this powerful piece
of technology really be
deployed? Gene drives
have already been suc-
cessfully created within
laboratories, but their
effect if released into the
wild is yet unknown.
The effect of releasing
gene drives into ecosys-
tems is not yet known,
but they would likely
seriously affect population
dynamics. There is also
the fear of an accidental
release, which is why
most labs take precau-
tions. The risk is always
there, however, and the
fallout could be disas-
trous. Furthermore, there
is the existence of gene
flow, which means that
species may breed with
neighbouring species. If
gene flow happens then
the gene drive may not
be confined to only one
species, the spread to
other species will lead to
unwanted consequences,
and a more complicated
situation. For the case of
invasive species, the gene
drive may spread away
from the intended area,
meaning that the whole
species may be wiped out,
instead of just the areas
where they are invasive
and don’t belong. Lastly,
there is the fear of the use
of gene drives for bioter-
rorism, as gene drive tech-
nology isn’t hard to use
(although it takes a long
time to identify specific
genes and how to alter it to
acquire the wanted char-
acteristic). For example,
terrorists could possibly
add a toxin-making gene
to mosquitoes, which
would cause devastating
damage on a large scale.
Overall, there is a large
amount of uncertainty

over what would happen if
a gene drive were released
into an environment. Gene
drives have the potential
to save millions of lives,
but it could also have dev-
astating consequences, so
is it unethical to use gene
drives, or is it unethical to
not use them?
The use of gene drives
is a complex subject,
and the regulation of
this technology requires
discussions on an interna-
tional scale. In 2016 there
was a United Nations
biodiversity meeting
discussing a gene drive
moratorium which was
ultimately rejected. Gene
drives can change the
world on an international
scale, so in the future it
is inevitable there will be
disagreements on the use
of different gene drives.
In the meantime, scientists
are continuing their work
in this field, currently an
obstacle that has emerged
and needs to be overcome
is the evolution of gene
drive-resistant organisms.
A lot of exciting research
is happening, much of it in
fact taking place over here
at Imperial.
“Gene drives
could help
stop a range of
diseases, such
as malaria or
Lyme’s”
As a result, the gene is
certain to be passed on to
the offspring. The gene
drive will then repeat the
same mechanism when
passed down, resulting
in homozygous offspring

Google Daydream
The announcement of
Google’s second version
of its own VR headset,
with minor improvements
including a wider field
of view, new colours:
coral, chalk and charcoal
(notice a pattern yet?) and
Chromecast compatibility.
Prices start from $99.
Google PixelBuds
Of course they did.
Google released ear-
phones, smart ones no
less, with Google Assis-
tant functionality (when
paired with a Pixel 2).
The PixelBuds come in
three colours: Clearly
White, Kinda Blue and
Just Black. Included is a
charging case that holds
multiple charges, allowing
users to get up to 24 hours
of listening time. The
PixelBuds allow you to

The October 4th
Google Event: Pixel 2 and More
G
oogle an-
nounced a host
of new products
in San Francisco
on the 4th
of October
this year. Everyone
eagerly awaited the an-
nouncement, particularly
the unveiling of the com-
pany’s second flagship
smartphone, the Pixel 2.
However, in true Google
fashion, there were a few
surprises in the announce-
ment too. As always, Felix
Tech gives you a round-up
of what went down in
San Francisco. From the
outset, Google made it
clear the focus was on
Artificial Intelligence and
Machine Learning – the
idea of integrating clever
software with great
hardware.
Google Home Mini
Google started off
proceedings with the an-
nouncement of the Google
Home range. Amongst
the newcomers was the
Google Home Mini. You
guessed it, a mini version
of its original bigger
brother the Google Home.
Powered by an even
smarter version of Google
Assistant, the Google
Home Mini is designed
to either blend in or stand
out depending on your
preference. The design is
based on a small pebble,
made from a fabric top
and a plastic bottom, and
comes in three colours;
coral, charcoal and chalk.
The device is designed to
slot neatly in any space, no
matter how big or small.
The magic appears in the
form of four LED lights
under the fabric – they
light up to show the device
is listening or thinking. As
with all things Google As-
sistant, the Google Home
Mini can be controlled
by tapping or with your
voice.
Much like its big
brother, the Google Home
Mini can do a huge range
of things, from answering
random questions like
“How many teeth do
puppies have?”, giving
you updates on weather,
traffic and sports results
to personalised schedules,
reminders and news. The
device also works with
Chromecast – allowing
you to stream shows
directly to your TV or
music to your favourite
speakers. The Google
Home Mini comes in at
an attractive price point of
£49, making it accessible
to many more people!
Google Home Max
Google Home Max is
Google’s first foray into
the big speaker market.
The speaker is the biggest
in their current range and
includes built-in machine
learning and Google
Assistant functionality.
Google boasts the Max has
a 20 times more powerful
sound than the original
Google Home. The use
of machine learning has
allowed the development
of Smart Sound – the
speaker adjusts its sound
output automatically to the
surroundings it is placed
in using machine learning.
This can include different
physical environments
all the way to different
contexts. For example,
the speaker will play more
quietly in the mornings
(for those who aren’t
morning people) but play
more loudly when there
is a lot of background
noise (like the dishwasher
running). The design is
a simple one, with two
colours; chalk or charcoal
and comes with a helpful
magnetised foot stand
– allowing for either hori-
zontal or vertical use. At
the moment, Google Home
Max will only be available
in the US in December for
$399, but more countries
are expected to be reached
in 2018.
Google PixelBook
The next step in
Google’s Chromebook
series – a high perfor-
mance version. The
design looks very similar
to Lenovo’s Yoga line, at
10mm thick and 1kg in
weight, with multiple form
factors including a laptop
and a tablet. The Pixel-
Book boasts Core i5 or i7
processors, up to 16GB
of RAM and a QuadHD
LCD display. Of course,
it has Google Assistant
built in (with a dedicated
button) and an additional
accessory for tablet use –
the PixelBook Pen. Prices
for the PixelBook start at
of course tap to access
Google Assistant when
paired to your phone. The
idea is that you can keep
your phone in your pocket
as the headphones can
play music, send texts,
give walking directions
from Google Maps, alert
to new notifications and
read messages. Google
also showcased the ability
of the headphones to act
as a translator – using
machine learning and
Google Translate to act
as a real time translator
in your ear. Google’s first
earphones will be availa-
ble from November and
will start at $159.
Google Clips
This was definitely a
surprise for many. Google
Clips is effectively a mini
camera that captures the
important moments for
you, meaning you can be
in them and not staring at
a screen trying to get the
perfect candid shot. The
first version is designed
for parents and pet owners
– when you don’t time
to whip out the phone to
capture the moment. The
camera itself is hands-
