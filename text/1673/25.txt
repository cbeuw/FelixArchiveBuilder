The Union launched

Survey (Student
Edition)’ earlier this
week, which aims to
determine whether

I
mperial College
Union this week an-
nounced the launch of
their Student Survey
Survey (Student Edition),
which aims to determine
whether students think
surveys are a good form of
collecting data.
The survey, which is
available on the Union’s
website, consists of 152
branching questions,
including multiple choice,
ranked pairs, and free-text
space. Some of the topics
covered include how many
surveys the student has
of one to ten, and whether
they had suffered any
repetitive strain injury
through filling out too
many surveys.
However, there are also
more esoteric questions,
such as “Can a survey feel
pain?”, “Do answer boxes
have souls?”, and “If a
survey is in the forest, and
nobody fills it in, has de-
mocracy been deepened?”
The survey, which
went live last Wednes-
day, seems to have been
well-received: one student
Felix spoke to said “I was
so outraged over being
told I was too wankered to
use the ski-slope at ACC
night this week, I was
ready to mail anthrax to
the Union reception. I was
just about to put it in the
post when I got the email
about the Survey Survey
– I’m 45 questions in now,
and can’t remember what I
was angry about, or where
I am.”
Other students didn’t
seem too pleased,
however. Adam Martin, a
PhD student at Imperial’s
Data Science Institute,
was upset about the
amount of work analysing
ation,” he told Felix, “but
now I’m spending most of
my time teaching under-
graduates the finer points
of using Qualtrics and
crying in the bathroom.”
The move was
welcomed by Martin
Smithson, Imperial
College’s Vice Provost
(Survey-Formulation),
who issued a statement
saying “at Imperial we are
committed to continually
improving what we have
on offer, and excellence
in everything we do it at
the heart of our mission.
Survey-taking isn’t the
only way we ensure we
can continue to deliver
world-class research, but
it is the main way.”
When asked about the
time-frame for the survey,
a Union representative
told Felix: “It’s very im-
portant that we ensure
that our members’ voices
are heard, so we will
be leaving the Student
Survey Survey (Student
Edition) open until we
receive enough data to
take to College. Unfortu-
nately, the amount of data
required is an unknown
quantity at the moment –
“The survey
asks a series
of esoteric
questions, like
‘If a survey is
in the forest,
and nobody
fills it in, has
democracy
been
deepened?’”
filled out in the last week,
how satisfied the surveys
made them feel, on a scale
“The move
was welcomed
by Martin
Smithson,

Vice Provost
(Survey-
Formulation)”

might be.”

This week you’re the
registrar in Chelsea and
Westminster A&E. You
have to work through to
Thursday morning after
fifteen men dressed as
smurfs are admitted,
all with broken ankles,
saying something about a
ski-slope.
This week you’re
the press officer for
snowsports, and you keep
telling everyone about
the ‘6 days of powder’ on
your upcoming tour. The
government’s drugs task
force has your number.
This week you keep on
thinking the freshers are
getting younger-looking
each year. Then you
realise: it’s half term.
This week you decide
to make the most of the
clocks going back, and
spend an extra hour cry-
wanking in the shower on
Monday.
This week you’re the
Felix Sports Editor. You
plan to write a drunken
review of ACC night, but
have one slime too many,
and wake up somewhere
in Tooting.
This week you’re from
the Business School, and
you resist bringing up
that fact within the first
five minutes of meeting
someone. Well done you.
This week you attend
your first Union Council
meeting. You miss what’s
going on, because you’re
too busy thinking of
*fire* tweets and making
dank memes.
This week, you realise
that the election turnout
means that democracy has
gone too deep, and is now
trapped in the Sherfield
Basement. COME BACK
DEMOCRACY, WE
LOVE YOU.
This week the library
announce the next phase
of their renovations will
include closing the library
cafe. It’s the last straw,
and things finally go all
Lord of the Flies.
This week you realise
that Ethos does online
inductions now. Pity
they don’t do online gym
sessions too.
This week you go to
ACC night to try out the
outdoor ski-slope. Beats a
slip-and-slide covered in
beer and piss.
This week your Imperial
journey truly begins, as
course-loads begin to
crush your soul. There is
no joke. This is your life
now.

Union Council accidently dissolves itself during first
session
HANGMAN
Council will be on
indefinite hiatus after
banning all student
positions
NegaFelix
Editor-in-Chief
U
nion Council
marked their
first session of
the year this
week by inadvertently
passing a motion calling
for its own immediate
dissolution.
The surprise motion
was raised after a lengthy
discussion on what
student democracy is, and
how it could be fired up.
Thomas Rhidian, Chair
of Left Forum and the
Union’s ‘Arbiter of Moral
Judgement’, put forward
a motion to immediately
bring about direct democ-
racy at Imperial, through
the abolition of all repre-
sentative roles, and thus
Council itself.
The Union’s Deputy
President (Finances and
Services) repeatedly tried
to point out that the motion
would render Council
useless, but Rhidian
drowned him out with a
steady chant of “when will
we divest?”At the mention
of direct democracy, a
number of the sabbatical
officers made impassioned
speeches in favour of
the motion, noting that
making democracy direct
sounded quite similar to
making it deep.
One Council member
spoke to Felix following
the vote: “I’m quite new
to Council, and I didn’t
really understand what
was going on. I thought
it was going to be the
highest student-led deci-
sion-making body at the
university, but when I
got here we were put in a
windowless lecture theatre
and someone kept banging
the table with a hammer.
I didn’t know what they
were talking about, but I
knew from their voices
that everything was
getting very heated. I
thought pressing A on my
voting pad would be the
only way to make it stop.”
We asked a student
for their opinion on the
events. They said “I don’t
know what Council is.”
Rhidian issued a state-
ment later that evening:
“our political system at
Imperial is sick. The only
way we can cure democ-
racy is to kill democracy.
The dissolution of Council
is the first step in a journey
that will culminate in
Imperial being the world’s
first anarchist university.’
Council is now on in-
definite hiatus.
“The surprise
motion was
raised after
a lengthy
discussion on
what student
democracy is,
and how we
can fire it up”
