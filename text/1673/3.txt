90% of staff surveyed
felt that they had good
relationships with their
colleagues, and that they
were trusted to organise
their own workload. The
vast majority also knew
what was expected of
them in their role. Safety
was singled out as an area
Imperial did particularly
well in, with the majority
feeling their department
ensured they were safe in
the workplace.
The majority of staff
felt proud to work for the
College, and 80% felt a
sense of personal accom-
plishment.
However, while the data
seem to show that people
were generally satisfied
with their departments,
they revealed that few
staff thought that there
was enough collaboration.
Only 34% of staff agreed
that there was ‘effective
collaboration between
Departments that work
within my Faculty’. Of the
four main Faculties, the
Faculty of Natural Scienc-
es scored the worst on this
question, with only 30%
of staff seeing evidence of
effective collaboration.
Within departments,
there was evidence of
increased collaboration,
with 56% agreeing there
was effective collabora-
tion between teams within
a department. However,
some sectors scored
poorly, with the Depart-
ments of Aeronautical
Engineering, Civil Engi-
neering, and the Centre for
Environmental Policy all
reporting scores of under
50%.
Departmental Break-
down
A number of depart-
ments did particularly
poorly in the survey: the
Department of Aeronaut-
ics, in particular, stood
out for its low scores, with
53 out of 58 questions
garnering a below-average
response. Aeronautics
staff were among those to
have the worst opinion of
their own Departments,
their Faculty, and senior
leadership as a whole.
Fewer than half the staff
surveyed felt that they had
enough resources to do
their job, while only 29%
felt that their contributions
to the College were valued
and recognised.
The Department of
Computing also scored
poorly, with 50 ques-
tions below the Imperial
average. It was the depart-
ment with the least posi-
tive opinions of College
senior leadership, and
staff were among those
least likely to feel valued
at College: only 37% felt
that their pay was fair, and
under half thought that
their contributions were
valued. A number of staff
felt Imperial did not care
about their welfare, with
only 31% agreeing that the
College cared about their
health and wellbeing.
The results obtained
from Imperial College
Union staff, half of whom
completed the survey,
seemed to reveal a sense of
feeling under-recognised,
with only 39% feeling
that their work was rec-
ognised as a contribution
to College. Union staff
also had among the lowest
opinions of the College
we are an independent-
ly-led organisation dis-
tinct from College, with
our own strategic plan,
management structure
and Board of Trustees,”
which “explains why
they are less likely to
consider themselves to be
contributing to College’s
strategy.”
The representative re-
ported that the Union runs
their own staff satisfaction
survey every year, which
found that 96% felt they
understood the Union’s
values, and 93% felt proud
to work for ICU. They also
pointed out that “regarding
questions that are applica-
ble to both College and
ICU staff members, we are
proud of our results [and]
our scores are consistently
at least 10% higher than
College overall in some
areas
Other departments
that did not feel a strong
sense of belonging to
the College included the
Departments of Medicine
and Life Sciences, with a
minority of staff feeling
a sense of belonging. In
both these departments,
less than half the staff felt
they had enough resources
to complete their work,
and they scored poorly
in their opinions of their
respective Faculties.
Women working in the
Life Science Department,
in particular, were less sat-
isfied with College leader-
ship and line management,
and were less clear about
their department’s goals.
For some departments,
the survey reflected well
– the Grantham Institute,
Imperial’s research hub
for climate change and
the environment, scored
particularly highly across
a number of questions.
The Dyson School for
Design Engineering and
the Department of Earth
Science Engineering also
tended to score highly.
All departments have
now completed ‘Action
Plans’ to address the
results of the survey.
Among the lowest scoring
departments, there is an
emphasis on increasing
communication within
departments and with
College leadership. The
Departments of Aero-
nautical Engineering and
Medicine both suggest
increasing staff input
on their Management
Committees, while the
Department of Computing
states it will “provide
forums for discussion on a
termly basis”. Harassment
and bullying will also be
addressed, with an empha-
sis on “Active Bystander”
training and encouraging
staff to feel confident in
expressing concerns.
A College
representative told Felix:
“the College level results
and action plan are being
discussed this Friday at
Provost’s Board – one of
the College’s most senior
management boards – with
updates to the community
through Staff Briefing
later this term.”
However, among the
departments scoring
lowest in the survey, there
seemed to be a general
feeling that things would
stay the same. Overall,
53% of staff felt that action
would be taken following
the survey; however, in the
Department of Aeronaut-
ics and the Union, only
a third of staff surveyed
felt confident that things
would change, and fewer
than half those surveyed
in the Departments of
Medicine and Computing
had faith that action would
be taken.
Bullying, Harassment,
and Equality
One of the most sensi-
tive questions in the survey
asked respondents whether
they had experienced bul-
lying or harassment during
the last twelve months at
Imperial. Overall, only
81% of staff were able to
deny they had experienced
any such harassment or
bullying, which places
Imperial 15th out of 18 in
a benchmark comparison
with other universities
surveyed.
This is an increase on
the last two iterations of
the survey: in 2014, when
asked about harassment
or bullying, 86% of staff
were able to confirm they
had experienced neither
within the last three years.
Several departments
scored concerningly high
on the question: in the De-
partment of Aeronautical
Engineering, the Centre
for Environmental Policy,
and the Dyson School of
Design Engineering, 14%
of staff said that they had
been bullied or harassed
within the last year. For
the Department of Earth
Science and Engineering,
and College’s ICT de-
partment, the proportion
was 13%. In the majority
of cases, the bullying or
harassment appears to
have been carried out by a
colleague, the individual’s
line manager, or another
manager within their de-
partment.
College policy states
“harassment, bullying,
and/or victimisation is
unacceptable,” and says
“line managers have an
obligation to tackle har-
assment”.
Another possibly con-
troversial question asked
respondents whether
they believed ‘career
progression is fair within
Imperial (regardless
of ethnic background,
gender, religion, sexual
orientation, disability or
age)’. In total, 58% of
staff agreed that career
progression was fair, but
some departments report-
ed lower scores: less than
half of ICT staff, and 52%
of staff in the Department
of Bioengineering, ESE,
and Dyson School, felt
progression was fair.
Women were less likely
than men to feel career
progression was fair, and
were less likely to know
what career progression
opportunities were availa-
ble. Imperial College was
also a founder member of
theAthena SWAN Charter,
which was established to
“encourage and recognise
commitment to advancing
the careers of women in
STEM employment”. On
their website, Imperial
make it clear that, as a
public body, they have a
legal duty to ensure they
take appropriate action to
“advance quality of oppor-
tunity” for all staff.
The numbers reflect
a decline since the last
survey, which asked
whether staff feel they
had the opportunity for
progression regardless
of age, gender etc. In the
last iteration, 85% of staff
agreed that they had fair
opportunities for career
progression, against a UK
average of 63%.
Comparison
A College representa-
tive emphasised that while
“The Staff Survey is an
important tool to hear the
views of colleagues across
ourcampuses”,thatit“also
allows us to benchmark
ourselves against similar
institutions.” Imperial
did well compared to UK
university benchmark
measurements, with 14
questions five percentage
points or more above the
benchmark, and only one
question below. However,
a number of scores have
decreased since the last
survey: out of the 20 ques-
tions that could be com-
pared to the 2014 survey,
only one had increased,
and ten had lower scores.
In a statement, a
College representative
said: “The talents of Impe-
rial’s staff community are
our greatest strength, and
central to the College’s
mission. We know that
if we are to continue to
attract and retain the very
best staff, we must provide
a supportive working
environment. The College
Strategy makes clear how
we do that.“While we’re
pleased to see that 87%
of staff are proud to work
at Imperial, and to have
outperformed the sector
generally, it’s clear that
there is more still to do,
and we are determined to
continue to improve.”
“In the
Department of
Aeronautics,
only a third of
staff thought
action would
be taken after
the survey”
senior leadership.
In a statement to Felix,
a Union representative
stated that while the Union
participates in the survey,
“it is important to note that
Staff survey reveals poor opinion of College leaders
Cont.
A
complaint with
the Union was
raised related
to last week’s
Autumn Elections, when
it was discovered a mail-
ing list had been used
to promote one of the
candidates.
An email was sent
out from the Chemical
Engineering Society’s
Opinion split over Union’s election invstigation
mailing list, by a member
of their executive, shortly
after 6pm on the evening
of Thursday 17th October
– roughly 18 hours before
voting closed. The email
asked recipients to vote
for one of the students
running for the Faculty of
Engineering (Undergrad-
uate) Ordinary Member
of Council. It was sent
to 1228 members of
ChemEng Soc, of whom
it is estimated 8-900 were
eligible to vote for the
position. It was not sent
with the knowledge of
the candidate in question,
or the Chairman of Che-
mEngSoc, Kieran Naylor.
The position was one of
the most highly-contested
in the elections, with 16
candidates running for
four positions at the time
voting closed. In total,
over 900 people voted for
this particular position,
with the candidate in
question topping the polls,
more than 50 votes ahead
of their nearest rival.
A complaint was raised
over the weekend of the
21st/22nd by a Union
Council member who
was alerted to the email.
The complaint was raised
after the close of voting;
the Union’s regulations
for the Autumn Elections
state that “all complaints
must be received within
two hours of the close of
the voting period.”
A Union spokesperson
told Felix: “Democracy
is one of our funda-
mental values, and we
immediately investigated
whether this rule breach
would require further
action to ensure our
democratic integrity”.
They stated that the Union
decided that “as previous
similar incidents have not
required disqualifications
or caused election to be
cancelled, it was not pro-
portionate for us to rerun
this election.”
The Union’s response
seems to have divided
those students heavi-
ly-involved with student
representation: Naylor
described the investiga-
tion the Union conducted
as “appropriate”, saying
that “in general, I believe
that this issue has been
blown way out of pro-
portion through poor
communication.”
However, one student
told Felix that “as a fellow
candidate”, they were
“disgusted that the Union
will not be pursuing an in-
vestigation or disciplinary
action”. Another student
said “The Union failing to
take a harder line on this
demonstrates they only
care about democracy
when it’s convenient for
them.”
Naylor told Felix
“The ChemEng Soc, and
myself, believe that the
integrity of the elections
must be upheld by all
parties. We should always
endeavor to make sure
all candidates have an
equal platform regardless
of access to mailing lists,
social media platforms or
other mass media.”
He went on to describe
the candidate as “in-
credibly well-respected,
popular, and well-liked”,
and expressed his con-
fidence that they would
have won the election
with or without the use
of the mailing list, stating
that – while Chemical En-
gineering is one of the de-
partments with the highest
turnouts – he believed that
the majority of students
who would have received
the email voted before it
was sent.
The Union stated that
they “will follow this up
with the individual con-
cerned, who has offered
their apologies, to empha-
sise that this behaviour
must not be repeated.”
