‘Tis the season... again
You will need...
1. Beat the butter in a large bowl until soft - you can
use an electrical mixer for this bit.
2. Add half the icing sugar and keep mixing until it
is smooth.
3. Add the rest of the icing sugar one spoon at a
time and the spoon of milk.
4. Beat the mixture until it is smooth and soft. If you
think that the mixture is not soft enough, you can add
more milk but keep in mind that you want it to stay
on the sweet side.
5. Add the food colouring.
6. Now you are ready to have fun with your friends!
Remember, the one that makes the least scary treat
will have to clean the dishes, so don’t fuck it up!
I
’ll bet my lunch that
you have already
seen those shop-
fronts decorated
in orangey strips, the
vampire Frappucino ad-
verts outside Starbucks,
your friends marking
‘Interested’on Halloween-
themed Facebook events,
and those tacky, plasticky,
not-even-scary masks
lining the aisles of Tesco.
Well okay, this is typical,
nothing wrong here.
Except for one single
tiny detail: do we actually
know what all this fuss is
about?
Felix wanted to do a
Halloween issue – that’s
great! But after we actually
did some research, we
realised that a lot of
Halloween celebrations
around the world are, in
one way or another, just a
try-hard attempt to follow
the North American trend
of trick-or-treating and
scary costumes. Most of
the time we don’t know the
You will need...
1. Preheat the oven to 170°C.
2. Unroll the pastry and flatten a little
bit. Place in the tin(s) you are using.
3. Divide the pumpkin evenly, depend-
ing on how many you are making.
4. Add sugar and cinnamon. I would
like to be more precise about the quanti-
ties, but it’s really just a matter of taste.
For the cinnamon, I just go with ‘the
more, the merrier”.
5. Bake for 30-40 mins, until the pastry
is golden, and the filling cooked.

It’s difficult to get away from vampire Frappucinos and Halloween chocolates – but if you can’t beat them, join
them! Here are Felix Food’s spooky recipes for a night in avoiding trick-or-treaters.
• 150g butter – preferably
softened
• 300g icing sugar
• 1 tbsp milk
• Food colouring – you prob-
ably want orange for pump-
kin related decorations and
black for spider webs and
so on; for white ghosts, you
don’t need to add anything!

but hey, everyone is doing
it so why not?
So, enough of my
ranting. Here are some
‘Halloween’ recipes, so
we don’t look too out of
place. Maybe this will
comfort you after you see
one too many Pennywises
running wild on the streets
