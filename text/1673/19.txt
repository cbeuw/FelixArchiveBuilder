Moving on from Daniel: where do we go now?
As Sir Daniel Day-Lewis retires from acting, who takes up his mantle as the greater actor in the world?

A
s he named The
Master the best
film of 2012,
Peter Bradshaw
of The Guardian labelled
the anticipation around the
release of a Paul Thomas
Anderson film as “event
cinema”, only comparable
to the legend surrounding
the great Stanley Kubrick.
America’s newest master’s
latest, esoterically titled
Phantom Thread, concerns
a renowned dressmaker
at the centre of British
fashion in 1950s London.
Anderson is a filmmaker
synonymous with great
American stories, par-
ticularly those set in his
home state of California:
be it a megalomaniac oil
baron going head to head
with a young, charismatic
young preacher at the turn
of the 20th century, the
beginnings of a scientol-
ogy-like cult in a United
States suffering from an
identity crisis post-war, or
a young man desperately
crying out for a family
and finding one in the Los
Angeles porn scene in the
late seventies.
For the first time the
Inherent Vice director has
taken a step out outside
of the country that he has
analysed so profoundly.
If this was in any way
dauntingforhim,hewillbe
reassured by the renewal
of his collaboration with
the most successful actor
in Oscar history: Sir
Daniel Day-Lewis. The
two combined to startling
effect to create Daniel
Plainview in There Will
be Blood, as Day-Lewis
redefined acting. Ten years
on, and the three-time
Academy Award winner
returns to the silver screen
after five year hiatus;
yet over the summer we
learned that this would not
be a lengthy re-emergence.
Day-Lewis had said after
his last film that he would
be taking a break, and it
Day-Lewis was a fero-
cious and committed actor,
capable of completely
transforming himself and
becoming an entirely dif-
ferent man, or sometimes
animal, all together. The
stories about just how
intense his methods were,
and how intimidating that
could be for other actors,
are well documented. He
has held the title of the
best actor in the world ever
since he burst onto the
scene to win the Academy
Award for My Left Foot in
1989, and confirmed this
title with stunning perfor-
mances in an eclectic mix
of films, from The Last
of the Mohicans to In the
Name of the Father, The
Age of Innocence to The
Boxer, Gangs of New York
to Lincoln.
In the time since he last
worked, he has continued
to be considered the best,
as it was thought he would
return. So he will, but just
for one final hurrah. In that
time, a number of others
have emerged to try and
steal the crown. If they
have careers half as good
as Day-Lewis that will
be a great achievement.
While it is tempting to
linger and pay tribute to
the great performances of
now may be considered
the greatest actor in the
world. The King is dead,
long live the King.
Note: This is essentially
a list of the best actors of
the present day. Screen
legends such as Al Pacino
and Robert De Niro will
not as such be consid-
ered for this list in spite
of continuing to work.
Honourable mentions:
Michael Fassbender,
Benicio Del Toro, Javier
Bardem, Mads Mikkelsen,
Jean-Louis Trintignant,
Gael Garcia Bernal, Viggo
Mortensen, Denzel Wash-
ington, Kang Ho Song,
Tom Hardy, Ryan Gosling,
Oscar Isaac, Ed Norton,
Colin Farrell, Steve Carell,
Matthew McConaughey,
Sean Penn, Michael
Shannon, Issey Ogata,
Ralph Fiennes, Mark
Ruffalo, Josh Brolin, Mark
Ruffalo, Ethan Hawke.
3) Christian Bale
Best Performances:
American Psycho, The
Fighter, American Hus-
tle, The Machinist, The
Big Short
Though Christian Bale
was born in Wales, he
considers himself English.
Looking at his filmog-
raphy, he may as well
consider himself whatever
nationality he wants to
be. First coming to public
“Daniel Day-
Lewis and
Paul Thomas
Anderson
combined to
startling effect
in There Will Be
Blood”
appears that he has only
returned to join forces
with the man who brought
out his career-high role,
and that this will be the
very last time we see him
in a film.
“If any of the
actors working
today have
careers half as
good as Day-
Lewis, that
will be a great
achievement”
such a phenomenal artist,
let us look forward to the
future, and consider who
attention at the age of 13
as the lead in Spielberg’s
Empire of the Sun, in a
tremendously demanding
role of one so young, Bale
later garnered acclaim
for what is now a cult
performance in American
Psycho. From then on
Bale has managed to mix
commercial recognition
with critical acclaim,
playing Batman in the
Dark Knight trilogy and
starring in Terminator
Salvation, whilst still
managing to work with in-
teresting filmmakers such
as Terrence Malick, Jane
Campion, Zhang Yimou,
David O. Russell, Christo-
pher Nolan, Ridley Scott,
Todd Haynes, Hayao
Miyazaki, Werner Herzog,
and Michael Mann, as well
as garnering an Academy
Award win from three
nominations. Bale is as
renowned for the intensity
he applies to his prepara-
tion for a film as the acting
on camera itself, famously
2) Tony Leung Chiu-
Wai
Best Performances:
In the Mood for Love,
Chungking Express,
Happy Together, Infer-
nal Affairs
Hailing from Hong
Kong, Tony Leung is one
of the greatest actors in
Asian film history. Often
referred to in the media
as the Orient’s answer
to Clark Gable, Leung is
every bit as handsome and
charismatic, but the key is
that he is a far better actor
than Gable ever was. He
has roots in television, and
made the step up to film
with Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s
A City of Sadness, which
won the Golden Lion at
Venice. He gained interna-
tional recognition for this
film, and has remarkably
gone on to star in two
additional Golden Lion
winners.
Perhaps Hong Kong’s
two greatest cinematic
sons are Wong Kar Wai
and John Woo; the former
known for his delicate,
lyrical romantic dramas,
and the latter successful
worldwide for his raucous
brand of eye-popping
action. The fact that Tony
Leung is the favourite lead
for both of these men is a
testament to his versatility.
Even as Wong himself

skeletal in The Machinist
and The Fighter, while
gaining the same amount

portrayal of Bruce Wayne
and his podgy lead in

of accents and genres,
perhaps the only role he
has yet to completely
convincingly master is the
romantic lead.
decided to step into the
martial arts film realm,
so well-trodden before,
with The Grandmaster, he
relied on two things: his
unique eye for beautiful
imagery and Tony Leung.
Able to say as much in a
glance as a gunshot, Leung
is a truly wonderful actor
appreciated everywhere
by lovers of cinema.
Spotted performing in
the street with his brother
and sisters, Joaquin
Phoenix appeared on
television as a child before
coming to prominence
with a small but memora-
ble role in Ron Howard’s
1989 comedy Parenthood,
at the age of 14. It would
be another six years
before Phoenix returned
to the big screen, during
overdose. This experience
certainly seems to have
shaped him, providing
him with a brooding
darkness and trouble in
his eyes. Where others
pretend, he is the real
deal – his bark has a bite.
He stormed back into the
public eye with a haunting
turn as a problematic high
school student in Gus
van Sant’s To Die For,
going on to work with
the likes of Oliver Stone,
James Gray, and Philip
Kaufman, before earning
his first Academy Award
nomination for Sir Ridley
Scott’s Best Picture-win-
ning Gladiator. This made
him and the late River
Phoenix the first and so
far only brothers ever to
be nominated for Oscars
in acting, as well as
becoming the first Puerto
Rican (he was born in San
Juan then raised in the
US), alongside Benicio
Del Toro in the same
year, to be nominated for
an Academy Award. He
would go on to turn in
intriguing performances
under the tutelage of inter-
esting filmmakers such as
Thomas Vinterberg, James
Mangold, Terry George,
and M. Night Shyamalan,
with a particular highlight
being his incredible imper-
sonation, both acting and
singing, of Johnny Cash
in a performance that saw
him lift the Golden Globe
and come oh-so-close to
the Oscar.
Ever the eccentric,
Phoenix then announced
his retirement from acting
to pursue a career in rap
music, which spawned
perhaps the most noto-
rious late night show
appearance of all time on
David Letterman. This
turned out to be a hoax, as
Phoenix grew out a huge
beard and acted like an
asshole, all in the name
of performance art. Or he
just grew out a huge beard
and acted like an asshole,
depending on how you see
it. He returned with one
of the most devastating-
ly-committed performanc-
es of the century in Paul
Thomas Anderson’s The
Master, which saw him
in pole position to win the
Oscar until he slated the
whole notion of awards
season in an interview.
Since his comeback he has
only gone from strength
to strength, working again
with Anderson, Gray,
and van Sant, as well as
the likes of Spike Jonze,
Woody Allen, Lynne
Ramsay, Jacques Audiard,
and Garth Davis, embark-
ing on a run comparable
to that experience by the
likes of Jack Nicholson,
Al Pacino, or Robert

system in a near future
LA; a devious pimp ex-
ploiting an innocent Polish
immigrant in 1920s New
York; a stoner PI sucked
into a hazy mystery in
the 1960s hippie era; and
a troubled army veteran
turned gun-for-hire on
a mission to rescue a
young girl from a child
prostitution ring – these
are just some of the meaty
roles he has transformed
for with such astonishing
consistency. This man is a
chameleon capable of nigh
on anything. Romantic
lead, stoner, alcoholic,
singer, dancer, professor,
Emperor of Rome; he can
do it all. The diversity of
Phoenix’s filmography
is remarkable. The only
thing that is the invariable
throughout is the undying
commitment and fierce
intensity with which he
manipulates himself to
become these characters.
