T
he world is a
fleeting glory”,
reads Asha
Lul Mohamud
Yusuf’s poem, The Scab.
To the more than 110,000
Somali-born immigrants
living in the UK, many
of whom fled the Somali
Civil War as refugees,
this cannot be more true.
Stability is an illusion
when one has to witness
one’s own country torn
apart by war, leaving its
people in turmoil and
scattered across the world
seeking refuge. But with
the movement of its
people comes the move-
ment of a culture, of a
heritage, of a language, of
words – words that were
so beautifully showcased
in Sea Migrations at the
Royal Festival Hall, which
featured poetry readings
by four contemporary
British-Somali women
poets.
A collaboration
between the London Liter-
ature Festival and Somali
Week Festival, the event
saw readings of poetry and
short stories that tackled
issues of identity, of the
nature of home, loyalty,
love, and family. Despite
their different back-
grounds and mediums,
several themes recurred
throughout the evening:
where is home and what
makes a home? How does
one reconcile loyalties to
different lands, the culture
that one is born in and the
culture that one is nurtured
in? How does one embrace
family when one has to
traverse language and
culture to reach it? And
how does one hold on to
one’s heritage, when every
day is a step further away
from home?
The event takes its
name from another of
Asha’s poems, The
Sea-Migrations, which
laments the enormous
outflow of Somalis from
their motherland and
the underdevelopment
of a great land with a
great culture. “If people
abandon their homes and
decamp by boat,” she asks,
“who’ll stay behind in our
country?” Indeed, all four
writers of the evening
wrote of home and
identity, of the difficulty of
straddling loyalty to two
lands, and the dilemma
of having been forced to
leave due to violence yet
feeling a responsibility
to and identity of their
homeland.
Hanna Ali, the second
writer to take the stage,
and a PhD student at
SOAS, describes her ex-
perience as a child refugee
in her short story The Story
of Us, sparing no detail
when explaining how her
mother watched her uncle
die. In another story, she
describes how the bloated
bellies “reminds us that
one can be empty and full
at the same time”. These
conflicting states, the
emptiness and fullness,
the desire for stability
and the attachment to
one’s homeland, seems
to recur in the writing of
the diaspora. Despite the
violence she describes,
Hanna writes that her
country “refused to let
her forget that she fled,
escaping all the problems”,
words that ring with an
almost accusatory tone.
It is difficult to recon-
cile two vastly different
identities, a balancing act
that manifests itself in
more than just conflicting
loyalties. Having grown
up in the UK, Hanna
decided to study English
in college, a decision that
her mother could not com-
prehend. Hanna writes
that her parents’ love was
like “the silence between
whispers”, acknowledging
the quiet love behind
her mother’s cold, stoic
exterior. “Nobody taught
her to be soft”, she writes.
Her upbringing in a
different environment
from her mother inevita-
bly drew an even larger
gulf between her mother
and herself. Here, the sea
imagery of the event title
bears even more signif-
icance. When thinking
about home, Hanna
describes the “women at
the bottom of the sea”,
referring not only to the
lives lost on migratory
journeys, but also, I think,
bits of one’s culture and
heritage that are left
behind, lost to the swells
as one adopts a new land.
If there was one thing
that would give away
one’s heritage, it would be
language, the most visible
marker of one’s identity.
While Asha writes in
Somali and read her poems
in Somali with the English
translations read by Clare
Pollard, all the other three
women wrote and read in
English. Hanna’s short
stories have been translat-
ed into Somali by a third
party, and she laments in
one of her poems that she
“speaks to Somalia in a
broken tongue”. Another
poet of the evening, Farah
Gabdon, wrote that “there
is more English in me than
I can stand”.
Indeed, language is
the most obvious, even
if sometimes unrepre-
sentative, manifestation
of one’s identity. The
perceived loss of their
mother tongue is seen as
a marker for the gradual
erosion of their ties with
their homeland.
On that account,
perhaps one way to bring
two cultures together,
then, is the integration
of languages. Farah and
Hanna wrote about their
experiences of war in
English, bringing Somali
experiences to a wider
audience. Interestingly,
Asha writes many of her
poems in the gabay form,
a traditional Somali oral
tradition that alliterates
with a certain letter each
time. Yet she also deals
with contemporary issues,
making traditional forms
relevant to the modern
world. Her poems make
use of pastoral imagery,
describing the beauty of
Somali land, and referring
to images of camels,
flowers, trees and birds.
Perhaps this is an attempt
to recreate her home in
a foreign country in the
form of words, and to
share it with others.
It was fascinating to
hear the English trans-
lations of Asha’s poetry
read before the original, as
that meant that I was able
to better appreciate the
musicality of the Somali
with some idea of what
it was about. The words
rolled off Asha’s tongue
like the waves of the sea.
There is magic in hearing
poetry in a foreign tongue:
it is like a song – musical
notes without comprehen-
sible lyrics but still rich in
emotion.
With the increased
movement of people,
whether forced or volun-
tary, it becomes ever more
important to create bridges
between the native and
the immigrant, between
motherland and adopted
homeland, between
cultural identities. Events
such as this hold an
even greater significance
against the current so-
ciopolitical backdrop of
Brexit and xenophobia.
The writers have shown us
that nationality and race
are constructs, false lines
that are easily knocked
over and impossible to fit
within. Their words tran-
scend boundaries, gener-
ations, conflict, and even
language itself, forming
the bridge between identi-
ties, peoples, and cultures.
