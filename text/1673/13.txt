Clash of Cultures: Can the arts thrive in the science
dominated campus of Imperial?

Adam Gellatly
Arts Editor
Adam: Can you de-
scribe what being
involved in radio en-
tails, what artistic as-
pects of radio are you
interestedin,andhow
long you have been
involved in those?
Sebastian: It’s funny
you’re interested in the arts
because apart from music
I’m not particularly artis-
tically inclined, I’m more
involved in the technical
aspect. But, of course, in
IC Radio the main service
we provide is the ability to
present shows. If you’re
presenting a show you’re
doing it to entertain, relay
information, or get people
interested in a particular
genre of music.
A: You say you’re not
artistic, but you’re
very into DJ’ing,
which is definitely an
art-form.
S: Yeah, I DJ on IC Radio.
My show is called Record
Surgery because I think
there’s something quite
beautiful about DJ’ing
with vinyl. But personally,
I wouldn’t call DJ’ing an
art form, because it’s so
simple now. The basic
idea of DJ’ing is to match
BPMs – the speed of songs
– in order to mix one song
into the other and new
software makes that super
easy. I’ll probably piss of
the whole of Music Tech
Society by saying that. I
will admit that the differ-
ence between a good and
bad DJ is song selection,
and you’ll find people who
wax lyrical about how you
should take the listener
on a journey. Sometimes
you hear that well done,
but ninety-five percent
of the time people fail at
that. People think “I’m a
DJ, I need to play bangers
all the time”, or “I’m a
tech-house DJ and I need
to play boring shit for two
hours straight”. There’s
an old DJ Marky jungle
mix that’s really good at
taking you on that journey
through the historical pro-
gression of that genre. At
Imperial, I like the variety
of the music Debesh
Mandal plays on his show
[The Big Daddy Hour] and
I admire the fact that he
uses vinyl.
A: Through running
the society and hang-
ing out in the West
Basement you defi-
nitely spend a lot of
time with artsy peo-
ple, even if you don’t
consider yourself one.
Do you think Imperial
students perform well
at balancing their aca-
demic lives in science
and their artistic side?
S: One thing that I notice
is even though we have a
lot of work, as Imperial
students we all have quite
high ambitions. Most of
us, if we try to do some-
thing, we try to do it really
well. For example, Joseph
O’Connell, the photogra-
pher for Felix, has been a
professional since before
university and some of the
DramSoc people are really
good despite studying, say,
Materials. Nothing I have
learnt studying Chemical
Engineering has ever
helped me with Radio:
there’s no plumbing in
Radio.
I find it interesting that
despite being such a tech-
nical university there’s so
many artsy types. I see it
particularly in those who
study Physics and Maths
– maybe because they’re
such pure sciences – that
they’re just attracted to
learning in all forms. I was
reading a Feynman quote
where he said, “Physics
is a bit like sex: sure, it
may give some practical
results, but that’s not why
we do it”. No engineer
would ever be that poetic.
A: Is your interest in
radio and DJ’ing pure-
ly a hobby for you, or
do you see either of
them as a future ca-
reer? And if the latter,
why are you studying
Chemical Engineering
at all?
S: I flirted with the idea of
studying Sound Engineer-
ing at university; I was
really into music produc-
tion before I came to uni-
versity. I read a lot about
the basic maths of sound,
so I knew about Fourier
series, for example, before
I came to university. But I
wanted to learn more about
why the world works. You
can learn about radio, or
history, or politics in your
own time and understand
it. But engineering and
maths are too complicat-
ed to simply pick up a
textbook and understand.
I don’t think I’ll ever go
into radio or media as a
job, but I plan on contin-
uing with radio as a hobby
once I leave university.
One of my heroes is Ben
Goldacre: he’s a physician
but he’s also a journalist,
and wrote the books Bad
Science and Bad Pharma.
If I could plan out my life,
I’d do the same: have a
technical job, but also let
the world know what your
work entails by going on
radio, or writing articles.
I think science communi-
cation is important, but I
find the science itself too
interesting to focus solely
on the communication.
A: What sort of job
are you looking to go
into?
S: My criteria for a future
career is that it must have
some positive impact
on the world. I wouldn’t
want to go into research
as I find it too abstract, but
working in something like
renewable energy would
fulfil that goal.
A: At, for example,
the University of
Westminster there’s
a full-time Radio Pro-
duction course. At
Imperial, we have no
undergraduates who
study radio. Do you
think the quality of IC
Radio’s output suffers
as a result?
S: I think if we had a
radio or general media
course we could do a lot
more. But, despite that,
all media at Imperial is
really active. Definitely on
In the second instalment of the series, IC Radio Station Manager Sebastian Gonzato sat down with Arts Editor
(and former IC Radio Station Manager) Adam Gellatly, to discuss the role radio has to play in the arts at Imperial.

the tech side we’re really
good, compared to other
universities. I did a year
abroad in Switzerland last
year – the radio studio
there was not as good as
IC Radio’s and they had a
lot more technical issues.
But in Switzerland they
had students studying
journalism for whom radio
was a career path and not
a hobby, so they spent a
lot more time in the studio
[compared to Imperial
students].
A:Ifyouhadtochoose
to be a part of only IC
Radio or your station
in Switzerland which
would you pick?
S: IC Radio for sure. I’ve
developed an irrational
attachment to this station,
which is probably a bit
unhealthy. But I’d love if
we had a sofa or a fridge
in the studio here like they
did in Switzerland.
A: Compared to oth-
er arts and media so-
cieties at Imperial, it
seems like IC Radio
reaches a much small-
er audience. If radio
is about entertaining
but your audience is
very small, why are
people attracted to
the club?
S: For a start, it’s enter-
taining for you, the host.
I’ve done shows with only
three listeners and it’s
been fun to just play tunes.
You also learn a lot. If you
listen back to yourself
you find you have a lot of
verbal ticks. And you also
learn to plan what you’re
going to say and how
to finish a point without
tailing off.
A: Last year it seemed
like IC Radio was split
into three distinct
groups: the tradition-
al group who pro-
duce their own shows
weekly, the Science
Communication stu-
dents who do radio
as part of the course,
and those in Music
Tech who are slow-
ly taking over as the
largest demographic.
Do you think IC Radio
– and radio as an art
– has lost its identity
and ability to survive
on its own merits?
S: The big thing that’s
changed since 1975
[when IC Radio was
founded] and now is that
no one listens to the radio
anymore, whereas DJ’ing
is now huge. But I think
radio is very good in
allowing people to train
their presenting and play
their music. Music will
still exist, mics will still
exist, recording will still
exist, even if radio as a
medium for entertainment
and disseminating infor-
mation won’t.

ALL THE LITTLE
LIGHTS
J
ane Upton’s All the
Little Lights looks
at the world of child
sexual exploitation
from the perspective of
the young girls who are
most often its victims.
It allows you to see
the seemingly obvious
factors at play in their
lives – poverty, isolation,
peer pressure – that make
them vulnerable to abuse.
When stories such as the
Rochdale case shock us
and make us wonder how
this can happen, All the
Little Lights offers some
insight into how the lines
between harmless fun
and danger appear to blur
for the children involved.
This is important to help
us understand how this
happens: how children,
even those with families
that seem to care about
them, can fall through the
cracks in the system and in
society.
Three young girls,
Joanne, Lisa, and Amy,
are the only characters
in the play, an important
choice, as we see the story
only from their perspec-
tive. At the centre of the
play is Joanne, who is
throwing an impromptu
birthday party for her
friend Lisa in a tent by the
railway. Their relationship
clearly complicated, as
Lisa is in foster care and
has been missing from
Joanne’s life, so much so
that Joanne has used des-
perate means to find Lisa,
posting a missing persons
ad on Facebook. This is
one of the first hints that
something is wrong, that
there is something hidden
in the shared past between
Lisa and Joanne.
12-year-old Amy seems
to be Lisa’s replacement in
Joanne’s life and their re-
lationship is also complex.
Amy clearly idolizes
Joanne, whilst Joanne’s
attitude to Amy is callous
and often cruel. We learn
that Joanne has introduced
Amy to ‘TJ’, the local
chippy, which seems
innocuous until we learn
that TJ wants pictures of
Amy’s breasts – the first
hint at what is going on.
Lisa is clearly terrified of
TJ, indicating the role he
has played in the lives of
Lisa and Joanne; we grad-
ually learn more about
their experiences and what
Lisa has escaped from.
The story and its char-
acters are based on abuse
survivors that Upton
met through charity Safe
and Sound, who works
to protect children from
sexual exploitation.
Joanne, in particular, is
based on the story of a
victim that Upton met
who had recruited other,
younger, children into
exploitation. Joanne is an
interesting character – it’s
easy to villainise her, easy
to see her as part of the
problem, as guilty as ‘TJ’
and the others involved.
However, there is a clear
undercurrent of desper-
ation and adolescent
confusion and, as the play
progresses, her own fear
and her motivations for
what she has done become
clearer and it is obvious
that she is as much a
victim as the other girls.
The quality of the per-
formance unfortunately
lets down the subject
matter and Upton’s
writing. Tessie Or-
ange-Turner is powerful
as Joanne, but the perfor-
mances from Sarah Hoare
(Lisa) and Esther-Grace
Button (Amy) are incon-
sistent. Button’s attempts
at capturing 12-year-old
Amy often feel forced, and
there are many moments
of over exaggeration.
Hoare’s performance
as Lisa improves as the
play progresses, and the
dynamic between Lisa
and Joanne intensifies,
but many aspects of her
performance fall flat.
This is only emphasized
by the staging of the play in
the intimate setting of the
Arcola’s Studio 2, which
leaves the actors bare to
the audience: the action
feels too close and the
performers are hampered
by the lack of stage space.
However, some aspects of
the staging work very well:
an elevated area serves as
the railway lines and is the
setting of several of the
most powerful moments in
the performance. The girls
play a version of ‘chicken’
on the railway lines,
daring each other to stay
on as a train approaches.
Stark lighting enhances
the moment and captures
the courage and the sheer
desperation the girls are
feeling.
Strong emotion char-
acterizes all of the best
moments of the play.When
Lisa talks of the people
living in distant houses -
the ‘little lights’ they can
see in the distance - Joanne
begs Lisa to run away with
her, to keep walking up
the tracks to the station to
take a train and escape the
place they’ve found them-
selves in; there’s so much
desperation encapsulated
here that you can’t help
but be moved.
All the Little Lights is a
play worth seeing for the
subject matter alone and
– despite some of the limi-
tations of the performance
– it shines a much-needed
spotlight on an important
issue.
