UK Party Conferences 2017: Corbyn is confident, May is choking, and Johnson is out for blood
Taking place each autumn, political party conferences are essentially
like festivals where loyal groupies go en masse to cheer on their favourite
stateswomen and men. Politicians take to the stage to discuss the current
stateoftheparty,setouttheirambitionsforthefollowingyear,andphysically
demonstrate that they understand the UK stretches beyond its capitals.

P-45s, writing on the
wall, and coughing –
the Tory conference
overshadowed by the
PM’s speech
Manchester hosted the
Conservatives and their
delegates this year. The
question on everyone’s
mind was whether the
Prime Minister would
remain leader for much
longer, and who from her
inner circle was itching
to replace her after an
embarrassing general
election campaign. The
who, it turns out, was
Boris Johnson. The
former London Mayor
and current Foreign Sec-
retary has been gunning
for the top job and now
smells blood after Mrs.
May’s disastrous General
Election result, which
saw the Tories go from
a majority to a minority
government. Mrs. May
has been haemorrhaging
support since, and Boris
smelled blood.
In other news, the Chan-
cellor, Philip Hammond,
made a speech during
the conference defending
capitalism and free-mar-
ket economics, accusing
Labour of leading people
“down a dangerous path”
through their left-leaning
policies.
The Home Secretary,
Amber Rudd, discussed
banning acid sales after a
worrying spike in attacks
resulting in devastating
injuries in recent months.
She also brought to the
forefront the discussion on
tech company regulation
and granting authorities
access to messages on plat-
forms such as WhatsApp
that currently have end-
to-end encryption, arguing
that such platforms were
“helping criminals”.
The most memorable
address, however, was that
of the Prime Minister’s.
She was plagued by a
tickly cough throughout
her speech, detracting
from the importance of
the messages she was
attempting to convey. If
her upper-respiratory tract
woes weren’t bad enough,
a prankster managed to
hand her a P45 – a form
telling an employee that
they are fired – stating it
was from Boris. If those
weren’t enough, the sign
behind the PM started
falling apart during the
speech: the writing on –
or falling off – the wall
perhaps symbolised Ms.
May’s current cabinet –
fractured and in need of
repair.
Finally, to add insult to
injury, Boris and much of
the cabinet actually had to
be cajoled at the end of the
speech to join in with the
closing standing ovation.
“We have become a
government-in-wait-
ing” – Labour’s call to
arms for another elec-
tion
Labour graced the
seaside town of Brighton
for their rendezvous this
year. The atmosphere
between Labour MPs
seemed amicable, with
the mutinous MPs who
last year would’ve wanted
nothing more than to see
Corbyn replaced with a
cleanly shaven Blair 2.0
appearing placated after
his better-than-expected
performance in the
General Election.
Much was discussed
at the conference. There
were some typical left-
wing speeches about
capping interest rates on
credit cards, nationalising
industries such as rail,
water, and energy, raising
the minimum wage to
the highest in Europe,
and taxing corporations
further.
However, much beyond
this was discussed.
Everything from the
apocalyptic hurricanes
plaguing the Atlantic
and the role climate
change was playing in
such devastating events,
to automation of jobs in
the future and how the
country should prepare for
such disruption.
The overwhelming
theme, however, was
Jeremy Corbyn. “Oh
Je-re-my Cor-byn” was
chanted at every op-
portunity like a case of
herd-induced Tourette’s.
It appeared as though
Labour were rallying the
troops for another election,
but this may, however,
be premature and in vain,
considering the realisti-
cally slim chance of the
Tories collapsing and
ceding their power.
He (or his PR team)
certainly can satiate the
youth, however. He was
asked whether he wanted
to take off his jacket at a
fringe event to which he
retorted, “the man’s not
hot” – referencing the
latest phenomenon to grip
social media: ‘the ting
goes’ memes. Although
the line was perhaps his
most awkwardly deliv-
ered, and was as cringe-
worthy as seeing your
dad dance at New Year’s,
it was nonetheless lapped
up by his young backers.
At the start of his closing
speech, he mentions how
the atmosphere of the
crowd was infectious and
that they should all make
sure “the whole country
is infected with the same
thing” (puzzled emoji).
Every meme he touches
turns viral so perhaps he is
onto something.
Liberal Democrats
limber up to regain
their position
The Lib Dems took a
trip to the seaside as they
opened the conference
season in Bournemouth.
Sir Vince Cable, the
former business secretary
and newly appointed
party leader, is attempting
to reclaim the position
of the third largest party
after being punished for
going into coalition with
the Conservatives back in
2010 and breaking crucial
manifesto promises, such
as the infamous tuition
fee increase backtrack.
The humbling experience
resulted in their 57 strong
MPs all but disappearing,
leaving only 8 standing
today.
They are now in re-
building and rebranding
mode, wanting to become
the party of “no Brexit is
better than a bad Brexit”,
and once again lure the
youth, as well as appeal-
ing to the snubbed 48%
who voted to stay in the
EU. During the confer-
ence, delegates agreed to
commit to a referendum
on the final Brexit deal,
with the option to stay in
the EU.
Also, on the agenda
were discussions about
radical tax reform to tax
wealth rather than work,
creating disincentives for
second homes, tax penal-
ties on properties acquired
for investment purposes
by overseas residents, and

changes to, you guessed it,
tuition fees. Although, on
the final point they stopped
short of committing to
anything specific, leaving
it as the open statement
“rethink the student debt
burden” because “the
worry about debt does
cause students and their
families real concern”.
The Lib Dems have
always put forward
convincing arguments
and policies that appeal
to both the left and right.
However, from the con-
ference, it appears that
their current task is to
convince delegates and
potential members that
they can deliver on these
as opposed to offering
false pledges.
The SNP take to Glas-
gow
The Scottish National
Party, fronted by their
leader Nicola Sturgeon,
held their conference in
Glasgow.
The General Election
for the SNP was a big
setback: they lost twen-
ty-one parliamentary
seats, but remain in power
in Scotland alongside the
Scottish Greens.
Key points from the
conference included
pledging to create a state-
owned energy company
in Scotland that offers the
cheapest power – “renew-
able of course” – to home-
owners, and a £20,000
bursary to professionals
to go towards retraining as
a teacher – due to current
shortages. Scottish Labour
has said that such policies
had been “photocopied”
from their own proposals.
The SNP also said that
they would pay residency
fees for EU citizens
currently working in the
Scottish public sector,
and so protect 20,000 EU
nationals currently with
jobs in hospitals, schools,
universities, and public
agencies.
They also voted for
a motion calling for a
ban on under-18s being
recruited by the UK armed
forces in roles requiring
combat training. Speakers
at the conference said that
the military was purposely
targeting youth from
low-income backgrounds
through social media
advertising. They argued
that enlisting those under
eighteen increased their
risk of death in battle,
post-traumatic stress
disorder, and alcohol
abuse. Critics of this,
however, argue that the
motion ignores issues
regarding pay, equipment,
and housing, and would
deny opportunities to
some youngsters.
Plaid Cymru set out
their vision for Wales
Plaid Cymru, the party
from Wales, held their
conference in Caernarfon
last week.
Leader Leanne Wood,
and her party, promised
a “rail revolution”,
offering new routes across
the country as well as
providing education and
re-training to the over
290,000 workers in Wales
threatened by increasing
automation and technolo-
gy disruptions. On Brexit,
Plaid stated that people
must have the opportunity
to reject the disastrous
situation of a no-deal
scenario, either through a
public vote or via a parlia-
mentary democracy on the
matter.
Greens set out their
policies to protect the
environment
The Green party, jointly
headed by Caroline Lucas
and Jonathan Bartley,
arrived in Harrogate,
North Yorkshire for their
conference. In the General
election, their vote share
was reduced, but they
retained their Brighton
Pavilion parliamentary
seat.
During the conference,
they stated that they had
“suffered” because of a
two-party system, but
that their environmentally
considerate ideas and
policies were now part of
the mainstream and that
their aim was to be “the
most influential” party in
21st
Century politics.
Issues and policies
discussed related to: elec-
toral reforms regarding
the need for a propor-
tional voting system as
opposed to a two-party
one; offshore wind energy
prices dropping below that
of nuclear – necessitating
the need for Hinkley Point
C to be reconsidered; a
four-day working week;
the Grenfell Tower
tragedy; and what Brexit
would mean for the
environment. On the last
point, Jonathan Bartley
stated that the “Green
Brexit” the Conservatives
had been proposing was
an oxymoron, stating that
“almost by definition the
Conservatives seem to be
anti-environment”, and
their recent decisions on
fracking and fossil-fuel
subsidies did not align
with a green vision.
§
Conferences offer
interesting insights and
opportunities to compare
positions of the different
parties and its members on
key issues, allowing us to
think about who we might
vote for, the next time the
occasion should arise – the
fabric of a democracy.
