THE PARTY
I
f you’d just been
promoted to Shadow
Minister for Health,
wouldn’t you feel that
a small party might be in
order? Just a small get
together with your nearest
and dearest surely couldn’t
hurt. Well, after watching
The Party, it turns out you
may want to reconsider.
A sharp and deeply
funny chamber piece, this
black comedy is brought
to life by its stellar cast.
Heading up is Janet
(Kristin Scott Thomas)
as the recently promoted
Shadow Minister, thrilled
to scale these political
heights. Co-hosting the
party is her husband Bill
(Timothy Spall), a man
who gave up his career to
help propel her to the top.
Joining them is Janet’s
cynical childhood friend
April (Patricia Clarkson),
who’s brought along
her estranged partner,
the ‘spiritual’ life-coach
Gottfried (played by
Bruno Ganz – Hitler from
the Downfall memes).
Rounding off the cast are
Cherry Jones and Emily
Mortimer as mothers
to be Martha and Jinny,
and Cillian Murphy as a
banker married to Janet’s
spin doctor, a man thor-
oughly tired of all these
champagne socialists.
about long term relation-
ships, and maintaining
happiness through change.
Both written and directed
by Sally Potter, who
over the years has won
shedloads of awards for
films including Orlando
and The Tango Lesson,
The Party is filled with
tension from the get-go,
pitching characters against
each other and bringing
out unanimously brilliant
performances from every
member of the cast. The
most striking directorial
choice however, is using
black and white cine-
matography, giving a kind
of eerie timelessness and
inevitability to the plot.
For all its strengths, the
film isn’t perfect. Most
noticeably, at time the
script can be a bit clunky,
especially in the early
scenes. As Bill, Timothy
Spall affects a spaced-out
manner, which is sort of
explained but never really
justified, and all the char-
acters can have a propen-
sity to dip into caricature
at the big moments. Yet
the good vastly outweighs
the bad.
Not only is it laugh-out-
loud funny, but sweet and
thoughtful. The mono-
chrome filming keeps you
far enough away to see the
humour, whilst keeping it
vivid enough to feel every
emotional blow. Staging
the party almost entirely
in two rooms keeps the
tension ratcheted up, and
there’s no flab at all. And
best of all, a cute fox
named Cherry makes an
appearance.
All in all, The Party is
a fantastic little picture, a
black comedy filled with
sharp twists and delightful
lines. With insights into
relationships, friendships
and politics, and ranging
from riotous to shocking,
this film is definitely worth
a watch.

As the cynic, April gets
the best lines of the bunch,
brushing off Martha as “a
first-class lesbian but a
second-rate thinker”. The
clashes between her and
the maddeningly-eccentric
Gottfried are the funniest
in the film, and burst out in
almost every scene. These
clashes are symptomatic
of the script’s scepticism
