What is a Hop-on
Hop-off bus tour?
A Hop-on Hop-off bus
tour is a city sightseeing
tour, usually on a dou-
ble-decker bus with the
upper level left open. The
tour involves a free audio
guide in different languag-
es, with the number and
variety of the languages
depending on the city that
the tour bus operates in. In
large cities, the buses are
frequent during the high
season and may have more
than one route. What’s
special about them is that
you can hop on and off at
various stops whenever
you want throughout your
ticket validity. 24h tickets
are the most common,
with 48h tickets also avail-
able in some cities.
When should I take a
Hop-on Hop-off bus
tour?
Such tours are incredi-
bly useful when you have
a limited amount of time
to spend in a place you’re
visiting. The tour usually
lasts for one hour, but
I’ve recently been on one
that lasted for two hours,
so you should check the
time with the bus driver
or other people working
for the company. You can
find tour operating times
and ticket prices on the
company’s website or spot
them in advertisements
across the city you’re
visiting.
These tours are also
a promising choice if
you want to visit many
different attractions that
are far apart. There are
cases when the public
transport is not reliable or
where you simply want to
learn something whilst on
the go, which you can do
by listening to the audio
guide on the tour bus.
What are the advan-
tages and disadvan-
tages?
Advantages of Hop-on
Hop-off bus tours include
visiting the major sights of
a city in a short amount of
time, while also hearing a
few historical facts about
them; connecting with the
major city attractions; and
having the choice of many
different audio guide lan-
guages.
However, there are a
few disadvantages. Firstly,
weather conditions, such
as bright sunlight, rain,
and strong winds, can
spoil your tour, especially
when the bus is moving.
Most buses don’t have a
roof on the top floor, so
when it’s hot make sure to
bring a hat and wear lots of
sun cream; and when it’s
rainy, make sure to bring
a waterproof jacket. I per-
sonally don’t recommend
sitting on the lower level
as the view can be limited.
Secondly, the bus tours
are generally not suitable
for taking good photos.
Finally, such tours can be
expensive. However, some
of them include discounts
for other attractions when
you show your bus ticket
at the door or apply for a
provided discount voucher
online, so check this in
advance. Ed: In London,
day tickets cost around
£30 per person, though
they usually also include
a Thames cruise, walking
tours, and whatnot.
When to book?
Tickets can be bought
anytime from the bus
driver. However, advance
booking is recommended,
especially during the high
season and for popular
destinations. Online
bookings may also offer
a discount. But for some
cities/companies, online
booking may not be avail-
able, so buying tickets
from the driver may be the
only option.
How do I take better
photos?
As mentioned earlier,
bus tours aren’t good
for taking photos. When
you’re trying to take a
photo, the bus will be
moving, and when it stops,
inevitably either a car or a
tree will be blocking the
view. So here are some
tips:
Firstly, put your camera
into standby mode, so
you can act quickly when
needed. Secondly, aim to
take photos when the bus
isn’t moving, e.g. at traffic
lights, before making a
turn, or at stops. Most
buses stop at popular
tourist attractions or even
viewing points, though
this is subject to the city
and their regulations.
Take advantage of all
those stops and take a few
photos if there’s anything
special out there.
Moreover, choose your
seat wisely. On a full bus,
this may not be an option,
but if you take the bus
from its starting point,
you may have a few more
choices. For instance,
sitting in the front row
gives you a full view of
what’s ahead. The only
disadvantages are that the
front window usually isn’t
clean, and you can also
see your reflection when
taking photos.
Finally, keep your
camera still, like on
the edge of the bus.
WARNING: Only do this
if your camera has a strap
that you can wrap around
your wrist/neck/shoulder,
and remember to hold it
tightly!
