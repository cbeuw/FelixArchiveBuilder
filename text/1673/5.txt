L
ast week’s legis-
lative elections
in the Czech
Republic were
record-breaking in many
ways – most candidates
and parties standing; most
fragmented Chamber of
Deputies to date, with
nine parties crossing the
5% mark; and the first
time in the country’s
history that neither Civic
Democrats (ODS) nor
Social Democrats (ČSSD)
won. These changes mark
a shift in Czech voting
tendencies, mirroring
those found all across
Europe.
The landslide victory of
ANO, a centrist-populist
party led by Czechia’s
second richest manAndrej
Babiš, was predicted
by all polling agencies.
However, prognoses about
the remaining parties
completely failed, grossly
underestimating the
appeal of the Pirate Party
and the anti-immigration,
anti-Islamic, Eurosceptic
“Freedom and Direct
Democracy” (SPD) which
finished third and fourth
respectively. They also
failed to predict the poor
results of the left-wing
ČSSD and Communist
party (KSČM) who each
got a meager 7% – their
poorest result yet. The
reason for these inaccura-
cies? Although the authors
of the polls claim we need
to take standard error into
account, the main factor
was most likely the inde-
cisiveness of many voters.
This uncertainty reflects
distrust and displeasure
with the traditional
parties, and so many of the
wavering voters laid their
hopes in the new, anti-es-
tablishment parties such as
Pirates and SPD.
Although ANO estab-
lished itself as the winner
in all regions, a closer
look reveals nuances:
the party gained most of
their new votes where
ČSSD suffered the largest
losses – thus it seems
that ANO pulled its votes
from Social Democrats,
although the two parties
have led the government
together for the past four
years. The country has
prospered under their
governance, maintaining
a surplus budget for two
consecutive years and
decreasing the unemploy-
ment rate to the lowest
in the EU. One can argue
that both parties have
a share in this success:
however, ANO took the
credit. Why is that the
case? The persona of the
ANO’s Andrej Babiš plays
a major role, being cited as
the second most influential
factor in the election of the
party.
But who is Babiš? The
Slovak-born agricultural
and media tycoon entered
in the Communist party.
However, much like
Donald Trump and Silvio
Berlusconi to whom he is
likened, the voters don’t
seem to mind his wealth.
They also gladly turn a
blind eye to many accu-
sations against him – such
as the ‘Stork Nest Case’
in which Babiš received
EU subsidies intended for
small enterprises for his
recreation centre and farm,
which is part of the large
conglomerate Agrofert.
He also allegedly coop-
erated with Communist
secret police during the
totalitarian regime. Babiš
rejects all these accusa-
tions as political attempts
to destroy him.
Now that ANO is
in power, what can we
expect? Babiš is not a
man of ideology, and that
makes him unpredictable.
However, one can get an
idea from his book where
he outlines his vision
of Czech Republic in
18 years: let’s dissolve
municipal councils,
regional assemblies, and
the Senate, and stream-
line the system, he says;
let’s run the state like a
company. Such changes
would concentrate power
into the hands of a few,
namely the MPs and the
mayors, and raise concern
about the preservation of
democracy. The abolition
of the Senate would also
enable changes to the
constitution without mod-
eration. Another concept
that Babiš would like to
introduce is direct democ-
racy – an idea appealing to
the Pirates and SPD. Su-
perficially, there is nothing
as democratic as giving
the power to the people.
However, one must be
wary of the consequences
– after all, many voters
tend to decide emotionally
rather than rationally, and
some decisions require
expertise in the subject.
As an example, direct
democracy was one of the
factors explaining why
women in Switzerland
were only granted suffrage
in 1971. One of the first
referendums would inevi-
tably be about “Czexit”, as
the anti-European mood
is rising among Czechs.
What would follow is
unimaginable.
Where do the others
come in? The gamut of po-
litical views in the lower
chamber is colourful
and reaching agreement
will be difficult. None of
the parties is willing to
form a coalition with the
ANO, with the exception
of the SDP, but they are
just as dismissive of a
minority government.
It’s only clear that there
are many changes ahead:
power within the parties is
shifting as they deal with
their defeats, and half of
MPs have been replaced.
The lower chamber has
diversified as many
politicians under 30s and
women were elected, but
has also become more
polarized.
Czech Republic took
a step in the populist,
right-wing, anti-European
direction, much like its
neighbours Germany,
Austria, and Poland.
Where this road will lead
is difficult to tell at the
moment – hopefully not
away from democracy.
“The persona
of the ANO’s
Andrej Babiš
played a major
role in their
success in the
Czech election”
the political scene in 2011,
when he founded his party,
which he states was to
express a dissatisfaction
with the corrupted state.
Although he describes
himself as a self-made
man, he largely benefited
from his parents’ positions
