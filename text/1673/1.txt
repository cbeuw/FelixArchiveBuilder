Staff survey shows wide ranges in satisfaction

Staff satisfaction rates
vary widely across
different College
sectors, according to
Imperial’s staff survey
results.

mperial College
released their staff
survey results ear-
lier this month. The
survey, which was last
carried out in 2014, asks
staff members their opin-
ions on a broad number
of topics, including their
faculty, College leader-
ship, and whether they
think the survey results
will be acted upon.
College and Faculty
Leadership
Out of all sections of the
survey, leadership – both
of Faculties and of College
as a whole – scored lowest
among staff.
Fewer than half of those
surveyed felt there was
effective leadership from
Faculty heads, or had a
clear understanding of the
purpose of their Faculty.
Staff in the Faculty of
Natural Sciences were the
least likely to know the
objectives of their Faculty,
with only 37% of staff
feeling they understood
them.
In terms of overall
leadership, only 40% of
staff felt that the College
leaders showed effective
leadership, and 45% felt
they provided a clear
direction for the College’s
future.
One of the questions
eliciting the lowest scores
asked whether changes
made are made for the
better, with only 34% of
staff agreeing. The De-
partments of Aeronautics,
Computing, and Physics
were the least likely to
agree, with less than a
quarter of staff feeling
that changes were an
improvement. Staff in the
Faculties of Medicine and
Natural Science, and in the
Union, were also unlikely
to think changes made
things better.
Somewhat surprisingly,
the overall response of
34% still places Imperial
second out of the ten
universities used as a
benchmark.
It could be argued
that a contributor to this
divide between College
leadership and staff is the
result of issues with com-
munications: only 45%
of staff agreed that the
communications received
helped them understand
College-level decisions,
while just over half felt
sufficiently involved in
decisions impacting their
role.
One of the areas of
College’s strategy that the
survey reflected poorly
upon was the ‘Imperial
Expectations’ – seven
statements the College
claims “show how we
respect and support each
other in achieving person-
al goals and the College’s
strategic objectives”. Ex-
amples include “champion
a positive approach to
change and opportunity”
and “deliver positive out-
comes”.
Overall, only 37% of
staff thought that these
were useful to their role
at Imperial, with a large
number of staff having
no opinion at all. Staff
members working more
closely to the central
faculty (e.g. those working
in Campus Services)
were more likely to find
Imperial Expectations
useful, while departmental
staff generally had a poor
opinion of them: in the
Mathematics department
only 22% of staff thought
‘Imperial Expectations’
were useful.
Departments and Col-
laboration

departmental staff were
satisfied with their work,
and had good perceptions
