What's all this about?
Whether you're a full-time or
part-time student at art college,
university, polytechnic, a college of
higher education, or even a sixth
former, here's your chance to give
yourself a bit of intellectual bite and
get The Times at Vi price every day.
Simply complete and send off the
coupon overleaf and you'll receive a
book of PRESSPASS vouchers which
you can exchange at your local
newsagents for Vi price copies of
The Times, saving almost £50 a year,
which can't be bad.
So what's in it for me?
Firstly, Glamour.
As a reader of The Times you'll soon
understand the issues behind the
news, the debates behind political
decisions and the latest reports on
your chosen fields of interest.
However, you'll also find that the most
appealing people tend to gravitate
towards someone reading an
impressive broadsheet newspaper in
the refectory - a newspaper like
The Times in fact.
Secondly, Money.
With PRESSPASS you'll be able to
enjoy The Times every day for half
price and save rather a lot of money.
It's simple: just complete the order
form, tear off, and post it; we even
pay the postage. In return you'll get
a book of PRESSPASS vouchers
valid for a whole year, worth almost
£50 against purchases of The Times.
You can buy The Times on a
daily basis (with 72 daily vouchers) or
weekly, if you have it delivered (with
40 weekly vouchers).
You simply
hand your voucher to the newsagent
with half the cash value, it's as easy
as that. So send for your PRESSPASS
voucher book now. It's completely
free and our exhaustive research
shows it's the best way to make sense
of the world as we know it, win
friends, influence people and get all
the girls (or boys).
What else is in it for me?
To help get you started we're
offering a couple of great bonuses.
Firstly, you can have 2 FREE 3 - line
classified ads in The Times worth
£34.50, just the job to sell books and
records, or even get a job.
And secondly, a prize draw every
week could win you £100 - the more
PRESSPASS vouchers you use, the
greater your chance of winning, so
get going and cut out the coupon
now.
