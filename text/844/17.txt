Among the people you will meet in The Times...
M A T T H E W PARRIS, a former MP,
writes the most illuminating
and amusing Parliamentary
sketches in British journalism. He
combines a sharp pen with a real
understanding of the rigours of
Parliamentary life. He is the first
man the MPs read each morning.
You will find his dry humour, the
manner in which he takes the
pomposity out of politics, compulsive
and essential reading.
SIMON BARNES, the sports
writer with the irreverent eye,
gives you the inside track on all
major events covered extensively
in The Times. Barnes, with wit
and insight, writes the sports
stories that other papers do not
reach.
M A R Y A N N S I E G H A R T , as Arts Editor and
Op-Ed page Editor, combines an
analytical mind on the major political
issues of the day with an understanding
of the arts, from rock to jazz, from
opera to symphony, from theatre to film.
The Op-Ed page sets the agenda for
the day; the arts pages give you the
first reviews and the personalities
behind them whatever your interest.
C A R O L L E O N A R D , the business diary
writer with the best contacts in the City,
lightens the day to day reporting of the
world of shares and takeovers with
her stories of intrigue and power.
The Times Business News has the
fullest and best informed coverage
in the fascinating world of finance.
It brings you the winners and the
losers at home and abroad.
