CLUB REVIEW
For those of you who don’t know,
Hed Kandi it is one of the fastest
growing house labels. If you go to
any Hed Kandi event, you can see
why – it’s special. There are other
words I could use, but most couldn’t
be printed, so let’s just say it was
good.
It’s not just about the music, it’s
the whole atmosphere of every
event, be it at El Divinos in Ibiza or
Bed in Sheffield. You are provided
with a live act, dancers, entertain-
ers, an amazing environment... and
this is before the crowd comes in
and it really goes off.
Each time is an extremely pleas-
urable experience leaving you ful-
filled in every way. It’s on a par with
the first time you discover mastur-
bation. Come on girls, don’t act like
you don’t do it as well.
This was the first time for me
to go to Pacha, and having been a
regular at most Hed Kandi events
here and abroad, I had high expec-
tations and I wasn’t disappointed.
The dance floor was rammed by
10.30 and although it was meant to
have been a quiet night for clubbing
after the expense of Christmas, it
didn’t show. People were queuing
around the side of the building at
9pm, an hour before the event even
started.
For such a popular event, the door
staff were surprisingly welcoming
and unstressed. One guy told me
this was a piece of piss compared
to the launch of their new album
before Christmas.
Once inside, the club looked like
the sexiest person on earth had just
exploded, covering the place in pure
and utter gorgeous fabulousness.
One thing to understand about any
Hed Kandi event is that it’s like
being at a fashion show. It is essen-
tial to look good and when you get
inside you can see why everyone is
so damn sexy.
I can understand this may be a bit
daunting, as some Imperial students
are unfamiliar with the world out-
side their bedroom, calculator and
recent issue of Star Trek Weekly.
If you own a Hed Kandi album,
you will have an idea of the type of
music you will be letting yourself
in for at an event like this. Pacha
is spread over two rooms – the
main room was all about deep disco
house, and upstairs was dark, sexy
and dirty. OK, Hed Kandi lacks a
little in terms of perfect mixing and
timing, but the crowd doesn’t care.
They sing along at any opportunity
they can and as soon as Pav, the per-
cussionist, and Laura on sax come
on, you forget all about some of the
not-great mixing.
This is another thing with Hed
Kandi – you don’t just get a DJ, you
get a bit of live action as well. I’ve
never seen people get so excited
over the sight of a slightly bearded
fat man thrashing about and a girl
and her horn. It was so good that
at one point the DJ stopped and
the crowd leapt and cheered to the
sounds of a sax and a set of bongos.
I think the phrase I heard most
throughout the evening was “this is
fucking fantastic”.
I won’t spoil it too much for those
intending on going to the next Hed
Kandi event, but I can say you had
better dust off your disco rags as
it’s about going to a sexy venue,
being sexy and dancing to the best
sexy music. I loved it and can highly
recommend it. In fact, I don’t just
recommend, I insist that everyone
should go before they die or become
too unattractive. Just have a look at
some of the pictures to see what I
mean.
