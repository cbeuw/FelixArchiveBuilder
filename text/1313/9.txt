The Imperial Medics Boat
Club held a sponsored
‘Ergothon’ at Paddington
Station on 12 January. All
donations from this event
were given to the British
Red Cross and the Disasters
Emergency Committee in aid
of the Tsunami Appeal.
Over 60 medical student
rowers took part in the event,
and rowed the distance from
London to Penzance over
the course of a day. Even the
coxes took part! £1500 was
raised at this event, to join a
further £500 donated via the
website www.justgiving/icsm.
We are extremely grateful to
Rebecca Caroe at RowPerfect
(who lent us the ergometers),
Dan at the Red Cross (who
provided our collecting buck-
ets) and Lorna Enright at
Paddington Station.
