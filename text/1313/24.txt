Greetings, cruciverbovoracists!
I picked this week’s grid remem-
bering a certain Financial Times
crossword that I’d found quite dif-
ficult in my early ‘crossword years’.
The grid is quite restrictive in that
the only possible word lengths are
six, eight and ten letters. I suppose
the difficulty really arises from the
fact that most first letters are left
unchecked.
Also note that the asterisked clues
contain no definition but are all of a
type. Good luck! Jabberwock
