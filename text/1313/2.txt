A study last week published
by the Chartered Society of
Physiotherapy (CSP) has
identified 25 areas in the UK,
including London’s South
Kensington, as being major
pollution hotspots.
Respiratory physiothera-
pists have urged immedi-
ate action after the study
revealed that the level of
nitrogen dioxide air pollution
in certain areas of London
was as much as three times
the government target.
A measuring station next to
the Natural History Museum
found that the level of nitro-
gen dioxide on Cromwell
Road was 80 micrograms
per cubic metre, twice the 40
microgram target set by the
government for 2005.
Around 80% of the nitrogen
dioxide present in cities is
attributable to vehicle emis-
sions.
An Imperial College stu-
dent living on Cromwell Road
told Felix: “Pollution is a fact
of everyday life for me here.
This area is particularly bad
because of the traffic, so I
avoid walking or cycling along
the major roads. So I’m not
surprised by the results.”
Using information from 110
automatic monitoring points
spread throughout the UK,
experts determined that
South Kensington had the
second highest level of nitro-
gen dioxide out of the areas
tested. London’s Marylebone
Road was highest with 108
micrograms per cubic metre.
The average from all UK sta-
tions was 32 micrograms.
Nitrogen dioxide reacts
instantaneously with water to
form nitric acid. This means
it is toxic to various animals
as well as to humans, causing
irritation in the eyes, throat,
and on the skin.
In the long term, nitro-
gen dioxide exposure may
also increase an individual’s
susceptibility to respiratory
infection and cause altera-
tions in the lungs. High levels
of pollutants such as nitro-
gen dioxide exacerbate the
symptoms of those suffering
from lung diseases such as
asthma, chronic bronchitis
and emphysema.

The parliamentary system
and first-past-the-post voting
methods we have in Britain
mean it is vital that we have
two strong parties, so that
the Government does not run
amok with no-one to censure
it but itself. It is just a shame
that the second party is right
wing, allowing Tony Blair to
push further and further to
the right and steal the Tories’
thunder.
If the Liberal Democrats
manage to do what they think
is possible and become the
second party at this year’s
election, they may manage
to shame Blair into actually
behaving like the leader of
a Labour party. But while
the Tories are in opposition,
they must do everything
they can to win back seats,
and in their wisdom they are
swinging even further to the
right. Whether this will appeal
to many voters is question-
able, but they are doing their
best.
This week, they caused an
enormous storm by pulling
into debate the issue their
supporters feel so strongly
about: immigration.
Michael Howard, Tory
leader and the son of immi-
grants, put a full page ad in
The Sunday Telegraph which
promised that, if elected, the
Tories would impose a quota
on asylum seekers and intro-
duce a points system for eco-
nomic migrants. Cue much
wailing and gnashing of teeth
by the left wing papers.
The Mirror accuses the
Conservatives of despera-
tion and reminds us that “the
Tories have a history of play-
ing the ‘race card’.” Howard’s
predecessor, William Hague,
took a similar lurch to the
right shortly before the Tories
were thrashed at the polls
four years ago.
The Guardian reports
Trevor Phillips, chair-
man of the Commission for
Racial Equality, accused
the Conservatives of plan-
ning their campaign around
“ill-informed propaganda of
some of the more demented
anti-immigration groups.”
But The Mail, one of the
country’s most powerful
papers, is in support of the
move: “Our hospitality has
been abused. Many asylum
applicants are economic
migrants in disguise, play-
ing the system to stay as
long as possible. Others just
enter and work here illegally.
Michael Howard, himself the
proud son of Jewish immi-
grants, deserves much credit
for courageously refusing to
accept the orthodoxy of our
smug liberal elite who want
to suppress real debate on
this issue.”
The paper recommends
repealing the Human Rights
Act, which, it said, has caused
damage by giving “a green
light to asylum seekers”.
The Independent has one of
the most thoughtful articles
on the topic, asking: “Why not
use this excellent model on
our stretched public services
too? Put a limit on how many
injured people will be admit-
ted into hospitals.”
Under Tory plans, The
Independent points out,
Kelly Holmes would never
have competed for Britain
in the Olympics since her
father came to Britain in the
1960s without the crucial job
skills required for admission.
“There are those who prefer
to see the positive contribu-
tion played by new arrivals.
Britain, they argue, would
be a much poorer place both
culturally and economically
should Mr Howard’s vision
have prevailed over the last
three generations. The losses
would be felt in the transport
and health services, the arts,
sport and, crucially, com-
merce.”
The paper points out that –
unlike the stereotype of immi-
grants working in unskilled
jobs – three quarters have
managerial or skilled profes-
sions and are sought out by
the Government.
This debate is not going to
go away. No matter how dis-
tasteful some of us may find
it, it is important to many
voters and needs to be dis-
cussed. But let’s hope that it
does not become a mud-sling-
ing free for all.
Immigration
debate reopens

A group of protesters from
Imperial Against Imperialism
caught the attention of diners
in the Union building and the
JCR last Thursday lunchtime,
as they demonstrated against
the continued occupation of
Iraq by British and American
troops.
With two students dressed
as soldiers and one as an Iraqi
prisoner, the group handed
out flyers and spoke through
megaphones in an attempt to
highlight the abuse of detain-
ees at the Abu Ghraib prison.
A motion entitled ‘End the
occupation of Iraq’ was on
the agenda of the last meet-
ing of Imperial College Union
Council but was not consid-
ered as the meeting ran out
of time.
