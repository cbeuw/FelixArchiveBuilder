I’d like to take a quick
moment to set out what
these articles are about. This
is not a good place to find
choice political comment,
complaints about why men
at Imperial are so unwilling
to approach women, or even
much-ignored match reports
from some of Imperial’s fin-
est obscure sporting socie-
ties. Instead, on this page for
the next few weeks, you can
find tricks, skills and forms of
lunacy that not only look good,
but are surprisingly easy too.
Think of it as “Coffee Break 2:
Extreme”.
With that in mind, I invite
you to attempt our first feat:
the big red ball!
It’s big, red, and you stand
on it. No, really. Take off both
shoes (and socks), then jump
(yes, jump) onto the ball.
Now, try and stay on. Keep
your feet moving, your eyes
fixed on a reference point on
the wall, and a very strong
belief in whichever God you
believe in.
This can be mastered rela-
tively quickly, hence the need
to make life more difficult. A
running mount (where you
take a run up, leap and pray),
a static jump (where you bend
your knees, jump and pray)
and handstands (don’t ever
stop praying) are all possible.
As mentioned before, this
is actually much easier than
it looks.
Here are our step-by-step
instructions:
Firstly, take your shoes
off. Place your shoes near
the window where they are
unlikely to offend people.
Placing them out of the win-
dow is necessary in a small
number of cases.
Place your left foot on the
top of the ball, and step onto
it [see picture 1, right]. As
you step, the ball will rotate
slightly – put your other foot
on it to stop it rotating too
far. At this stage, it helps to
have a friend who stands
behind you ready to break
your fall [see picture 2]. They
should stand behind rather
than in front, as you can catch
yourself when you fall for-
wards.
Keep your feet moving! This
makes it easier to stay on
balance – do tiny little steps
each time [see picture 3]. If
you feel yourself going off bal-
ance, jump off – you’re going
down anyway, so you might
as well avoid landing on your
arse. Keep your eyes fixed on
a spot on the wall as it will
help you keep your balance.
Of course, anything you
can do on terra firma can
be done on a ball (although
some things may require
hasty adaptation and a super-
human sense of balance). We
suggest juggling three balls
to start showing off properly
[see picture 4]. Once you can
do that, try keeping your feet
still. Then try jumping. Then
try only one leg. When you’re
out of Casualty, tell us how
wonderful you are by email-
ing juggling@ic.ac.uk. We
meet every Tuesday evening
and have all sorts of weird
and wonderful toys to play
with, not just the usual balls,
clubs and the like. Please
come along – email us for
details.

In the last two weeks, we
have had more convincing
wins for the two Imperial
Chess teams: 6½–1½ against
West London and 8-0 against
Willesden & Brent in the
Middlesex League, and 5½
–½ against SOAS and City
in the ULU League. Having
lost only one match this sea-
son, both the Imperial teams
remain hot favourites to win
their respective leagues.
We pitted our wits against
Dr Jonathan Mestel, of the
maths department, in the
annual grandmaster chal-
lenge on Monday.
On Wednesday 2 February,
we will arrange a blitz tourna-
ment where each player has
10 minutes on the clock. The
tournament is free to enter
for club members, with a
prize of £10 to be won. Email
chess@ic.ac.uk if you are
interested.
Against SOAS and City,
Felix Balthasar, Robin Nandi,
Yiannis Phinikettos and
Beinan Liu performed well
to win both the matches they
played.
In the Middlesex League,
West London had fielded
strong players in their team.
But Richard Thursby, Slava
Burenkov, Moritz Reuter,
Peter Levermore and Kanwal
Bhatia proved to be too strong
for their opponents. Anup
Sinha beat his opponent in
an interesting and tense fin-
ish. Willesden & Brent could
not provide any resistance
against the Imperial team.
A few of the Chess
Committee’s responsibilities
include:
1. Organising all matches
– we are now firm favourites
for the first ever season to
win both the leagues simul-
taneously.
2. The Grandmaster
Challenge, as mentioned
above.
3. A tournament against
Oxford and Cambridge is in
the process of being organ-
ised. Cambridge have agreed
to play us in a few weeks’
time.
4. Organising the chess trip
to Greece in the summer.
5. Other mini tournaments.
The latest addition will be
the game where you play
exchange chess. Do you know
what I’m talking about? This
is a fun game of chess, which
requires deep and quick think-
ing plus team work... you play
in pairs! If you want to find
out more, why not take part
in the tournament for free
and win prizes? Just email
chess@ic.ac.uk.
6. Many more events: just
become a member of the club
and find out about them. Visit
www.union.ic.ac.uk/chess for
more information.
