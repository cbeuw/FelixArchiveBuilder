Security and first aid
I was disturbed, and disappointed,
to read the letter in Felix on the 20th
January regarding the response of
the Security team to a medical inci-
dent in the SAF building. I do not
wish to enter into a tit for tat corre-
spondence, but I feel it is only right
to correct the false impression given
by the letter.
I understand that the facts of the
case are these:
Two people (members of the pub-
lic) separately rang for an ambu-
lance before Sherfield Control were
contacted.
Sherfield Control was informed at
16.15 and immediately responded.
The individual concerned had been
having an epileptic fit. By the time
the officers arrived, the fit was over
and the student was back on his feet.
(None of our officers were present
when the fit was taking place).
The correct treatment in these
cases (endorsed by the Ambulance
Service) is for any obstructions to
be cleared around the patient and
for no intervention to be made until
the fit is over.
Two ambulances, called by mem-
bers of the public, arrived at 16.20
and 16.25 and the student was taken
to ChelseaandWestminsterHospital
for a check up.
The Security Guards who respond
in the event of an emergency call
are all fully trained in First Aid. 29 of
them have also been trained in the
use of a Defibrillator.
It is totally incorrect and irrespon-
sible of the letter writer to imply
otherwise. I cannot, obviously, com-
ment on the capability of the medi-
cal students around.
As I say, I do not want to create
a mountain out of a mole hill here,
but I do think it is important that
Security have the support and confi-
dence of the Students Union.

‘Atheism’ posters
Dear Editor,
I would like to voice my total support
for whoever it was that responded to
the atheism posters last week.
The ‘Life’ group at Imperial, a
Christian club, had put up posters
saying “Atheism: the fashionable
world view that can’t deliver”.
In due time, posters in the same
style but saying “Freethinking: the
sensible world view that delivers”
appeared. (Apologies if the words
aren’t exactly right.)
This simple lampoon is the first
act I’ve seen which bucks a trend
that’s passed unnoticed for a while
now.
The clubs – especially the numer-
ous Christian ones – blanket poster
the campus advertising their events,
hoping that they can make some of
the students pray/prey.
Last term, I saw one student
at Imperial preaching outside
Boots on Kensington High Street.
Unbelievable.
Imperial is a science university,
and such open displaying of reli-
gious activities gives us a farcical
appearance. For posters at Imperial
to suggest atheism is a bad idea is
absolutely crazy.

Exam anguish and term dates
Dear Sir,
In response to Tim Weinert-Aplin’s
letter I feel I must express my sup-
port for the action of Sam Rorke, as
my Deputy President (Education &
Welfare).
The Union does not have a “bum-
bling inability to see into the future”.
Sam was correct to point out that
term dates are set (provisionally)
ten years in advance and confirmed
two years in advance. Last year,
after a particularly late start of ses-
sion (which caused problems with
the autumn term starting at the
same time as the ULU/BUSA sports
season and ending too close to
Christmas) I checked the term dates
for the next nine years and made
sure that they were all reasonable –
a couple of changes were made and
these went through Senate without
anyone noticing. I couldn’t do any-
thing about this year’s term dates as
they had already been confirmed.
I should point out, however, that
sometimes the calendar just causes
problems. The main issue is Easter
which is the only Christian holiday,
that is based on a lunar date calcula-
tion. I can’t remember the exact for-
mula off-hand but it’s basically the
Sunday following the Paschal Full
Moon (put “Easter date calculation”
in Google if you are interested). This
means that the date of Easter moves
around, with a maximum variance
of 33 days! Sometimes Easter is
“early” and sometimes it is “late”
in our, solar based, calendar. This
means that the Academic Registrar
has a very difficult task trying to
balance the length of the Christmas
holiday with that of the Easter one.
Sometimes one or both is going to
have to be curtailed. The next major
upset will be 2008/2009.
As to exams around Christmas,
that’s really left to departments
(and so the student view should be
a on a per department basis). My
old department always took the view
(endorsed by the staff student com-
mittee) that it was much better to
have exams before Christmas so as
not to ruin the holiday. Other depart-
ments (again with the students’
agreement) have decided that it’s
better to give the students a longer
chance to revise. There is no right or
wrong answer as to how much revi-
sion time is needed and the views
of students on a particular course
can change from year to year. Sam
should not be imposing one view
or another on departments. That is
why departmental and course stu-
dent reps are so important.
“The Union” is not just the sabbat-
icals. Dep Reps are union officers
too and it is primarily their respon-
sibility to sort problems in individ-
ual departments. Ultimately Sam’s
(and my) responsibility is to help
them represent their students not to
assume we know what students on
each course want. Dep Reps should
actively look at timetables and get
problems sorted (I always did when
I was ISE Dep Rep). We don’t get
details of departmental timetabling
any earlier than they do – and we
cannot understand the consequenc-
es for the students as well as they
can themselves.
I’m sorry Tim didn’t get a personal
reply from Sam but all the sabbati-
cals do get a lot of email and Sam’s
inbox was very full of disaffected
Aero students – it is not too surpris-
ing that one or two didn’t get a reply.
The important thing is that Sam was
able to help the departmental reps
when it was clear that the students,
in that department, were not happy
with that department’s exam dates.
Kind regards,
Mustafa Arif

The dodgy dollar
Dear Sir,
Numaan Chaudhry missed out one
important reason why the dollar will
not collapse as it should. Petroleum
is traded in dollars and that accounts
for 40% of the world’s trade so there-
fore there will always be a demand
for the dollar regardless of the US’s
own balance of payments deficit.
Only one country has ever tried to
trade oil in another currency (the
Euro), Iraq, and look what happened
there.
Yours faithfully,
Nicholas Royall

The silly season has come and gone.
Come February, only the bull-head-
edly determined few can adhere to
their ridiculously ambitious New
Year’s resolutions. The mere mor-
tals among us should take it upon
ourselves to commit one act of altru-
ism this year; and what better than
an act which some of us, as future
doctors, are intrinsically linked to
– the donation of blood?
The number of people needing
blood and its components is rising
at an ever-increasing rate. One in
five surgical procedures requires
five units of blood to be transfused.
With older people requiring more
surgery, and the short shelf-life (five
weeks) of blood components making
it difficult to stockpile, more dona-
tions are required.
Blood is an essential commodity,
used to treat those with blood com-
ponent defects, immune deficien-
cies and cancers of the blood on a
regular basis, along with road traffic
accident and shock victims. Thus,
somebody you know, perhaps your-
self, may unexpectedly be needing
whole or partial blood donations.
We all expect blood to be there for
us, but barely a fraction of those who
can give actually do. Five per cent of
the UK population are regular blood
donors, donating the three million
units currently used on an annual
basis. However, current demograph-
ics, with an ageing population, indi-
cate the number of people available
to donate, aged 17-70, is decreasing
by 17% each year.
Conclusively, it is up to healthy
people, preferably from the younger
age groups, to take just two hours
out of their schedules this year,
to donate the vital pint that could
save another’s life. The West End
Donor Centre, located on Margaret
St, London W1 (nearest tube
Oxford Circus), is open from 8am to
7.30pm on weekdays. Call 08457
711 711 now to pre-book your next
appointment.
