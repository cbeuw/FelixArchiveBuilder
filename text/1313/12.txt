Around the world in 86 days
James Devine visits construction projects around the globe
In the summer of 2004, I
spent my holidays travelling
around the world visiting
construction projects on four
continents.
The aim of this journey
was to gather an insight into
some of the best practices in
the field of sustainability and
sustainable construction. The
project was funded through
an Engineering Leadership
Award from the Royal
Academy of Engineering and
supported by Bovis Lend
Lease. However, I wasn’t
looking especially at flagship
‘green’ projects, but rather
the mainstream of construc-
tion activity.
This article is intended as a
brief overview of some of my
experiences and findings. I’m
currently working on a more
formal write up of my travels
and discoveries. If you would

Dubai was the first stop
on my tour. The construc-
tion industry in Dubai has
been in a state of continu-
ous boom since the 1980s. I’d
never seen so many tower
cranes at the same time
before; it was as if the entire
city was being constructed
right in front of your eyes!
There wasn’t much evidence
of sustainability in any of the
projects I had the opportunity
to look at. Although it won a
mention, along with energy
efficiency, there was little evi-
dence that it was actually a
real priority.
Next stop was a flying visit
to Hong Kong. I arrived on
a Friday afternoon in the
middle of a Signal 8, which
is apparently a fairly severe
monsoon. By the time I got
to my hotel, everyone had
been sent home from work
and it was raining bucket-
loads. Undaunted, I jumped
into a taxi and headed over to
the other side of Hong Kong
island. The taxi driver insist-
ed I pay a danger money pre-
mium, because his insurance
didn’t extend to driving in a
Signal 8. I paid up and within
25 minutes we had arrived
at Repulse Bay. Fortunately
the construction project, a
housing estate, had achieved
practical completion a cou-
ple of weeks before, so I had
somewhere dry to weather
the rest of the storm.
The estate had been refit-
ted and refurbished as part
of a project to turn it into an
exclusive housing complex.
Some innovative techniques
and practices had been used
in the project, including some
very tight logistics to mini-
mise inconvenience to sitting
tenants. Although it hadn’t
been one of the specific aims
of the project, refurbishment
rather than demolition is
often cited as being better
on ecological and sustainable
grounds.
It was a wet 48 hours in
Hong Kong, which included
me accidentally setting my
watch two hours two fast on
Sunday morning, then madly
rushing to the airport, when
I could have had some more
sleep! I caught a flight to
Taipei, the capital of Taiwan.
I picked it up somewhere that
Taiwan receives 20,000 visi-
tors from the UK each year,
with an averagestay lasting
only two days! I managed
to negotiate my way to the
hotel, which was surprisingly
nice given how little I had
paid for it.
The choice of visiting
Taiwan was something of a
wildcard, but I found a sur-
prising body of work being
undertaken by Bovis Lend
Lease. I took an afternoon
out of the Taipei office to go
for a walk down the road and
see Taipei 101, the world’s
tallest building. Although not
directly involved in building
the skyscraper, Bovis Lend
lease had done planning and
management work on the
shopping mall at the base of
the tower. I took a side trip
to visit Tainan, in the south
of Taiwan, where a $300m
glass factory was being con-
structed for the American
glass manufacturer Corning.
It was the largest single con-
struction project I’ve ever
seen, with hundreds steel
beams, many over 1.5m deep,
all working 24 hours a day to
meet the client’s ambitious
requirements. Cement lor-
ries were rolling in continu-
ously throughout my two day
stay. As for sustainability, I
didn’t find it to be a particu-
larly important issue. Prime
focus was instead placed on
worker safety and meeting
the program deadlines.
After visiting Taiwan, I flew
on to Japan and spent some
time working in the office
there. As luck would have
it, they were engaged in the
process of modelling leak-
age from underground petrol
tanks for a client, so I was
able to put my maths skills to
use and help out! I took some
time out from the project to
visit a few ‘typical’ Japanese
construction projects, which
were a real culture shock
compared with a typical UK
site. Of ‘standard’ construc-
tion work ware, only a hard
hat was needed – no steel toe-
cap boots or high-vis jacket
as would be mandatory in the
UK. All the site workers wore
their company overalls.
I found the Japanese repu-
tation for quality, diligence
and efficiency to be well
founded. A large number of
efficiencies were to be found
in the construction processes
I observed, and although they
were implemented for eco-
nomic or legislative reasons,
most carried an environmen-
tal benefit which was not nec-
essarily measured.
Sydney, Australia, was my
next stop, and also the head-
quarters of Bovis Lend Lease
worldwide. Before spending
some time in the ‘big house’
as they called it, I took a side
trip to Brisbane, Queensland.
Initially, the trip had just
been a way of filling time and
visiting more construction
projects before head office
could find me a temporary
space. However, Queensland
had many of the most ‘sus-
tainable’ projects I encoun-
tered and a substantially dif-
ferent regional approach to
the subject. The most strik-
ing element of this difference
was a personal commitment,
on behalf of the engineers,
managers and construction
workers, to maximise things
like recycling and minimising
material waste on site.
Returning to Sydney, I had
the chance to study several
showcase environmental
projects. These are projects
in which sustainability is key
to the design philosophy, a
decision usually made at the
expense of minimising project
costs, despite the fact that
this does not always have to
be the case.
OneparticularprojectIstud-
ied was St. Patrick’s, a hous-
ing estate conceived as being
constructed in harmony with
the sensitive local environ-
ment and local community.
Another project was the head
office building itself. ‘30 The
Bond’, to use its official title,
has achieved class-leading
scores using the Australian
‘Green Star’ ratings tool. The
holistic approach applies not
only to the engineering choic-
es which have been made
in construction, but also to
the creation of a bio-diverse
planted roof and the adoption
of an engagement plan with
the local community. There
are also some outlandish and
interesting features, mostly
revolving around the use of
materials for fit-out. These
are so called ‘low embodied
energy materials’ or ‘rapid-
ly renewable’, and included
office interior cork walls and
goat’s hair carpets!
The final stop on my tour
was Los Angeles. In LA, I
spent some time with the
‘Fire Bond Program’, which
aims to build new fire stations
for the city of Los Angeles, all
of which will be environmen-
tally certified through the
US LEAD program. It was
an interesting office to work
in, with a number of uniform
‘Fire Chiefs’ from the LA Fire
Department.
On site visits, I was really
struck by the extensive use
of timber as a building mate-
rial. Unfortunately it wasn’t
sourced from rapidly renew-
able or managed forests, but
as such represents a substan-
tial opportunity for improve-
ment. There were also clear
signs that suppliers and sub-
contractors were being chal-
lenged by the inclusion of an
environmental metric in their
performance assessment.
With the correct incentives,
contractors were finding
innovative ways to raise the
recycled content of the fin-
ished building, such as rais-
ing the proportion of fly ash
in concrete, whilst balancing
the effect this would have on
its structural properties.
To give an exceedingly brief
summary of the whole trip:
In sustainable construction, a
huge difference can be made
through strong personal com-
mitment to sustainability and
a willingness to challenge
and ask questions of others
involved in the process.
