After the 20% surge in online spending by Britons during the Christmas period,
Numaan Chaudhry analyses the future of some of the biggest online corporations
EBay
EBay, the online auction-
eer, said fourth-quarter net
income rose over 40% but
narrowly missed Wall Street
expectations.
The rare stumble, and a
lukewarm financial fore-
cast for this year, sent its
shares down 12% in after-
hours trading. The San Jose,
California, company reported
net income of $205.4 million,
up from $142.5 million, in the
comparable period last year.
The result matched the com-
pany’s forecast. Excluding
the amortization of intangi-
bles and some stock option
expenses, however, eBay
said it would have reported
income of 33 cents per share;
just shy of the 34 cents per
share expected by Wall Street
analysts.
Revenue climbed 44% to
$935.8 million from $648.4 mil-
lion, surpassing the compa-
ny’s prediction of $915 mil-
lion.
For the year 2005, eBay said
it expects revenue of $4.25
to $4.35 billion and earnings
per share excluding certain
expenses of $1.48 to $1.52.
Analysts had been expect-
ing annual revenue of $4.37
billion and earnings of $1.61,
according to Thomson First
Call.
“This was a surprisingly
soft report for eBay dur-
ing a strong quarter”, said
Mark Mahaney, an analyst
at American Technology
Research. Adjusting for the
impact of foreign exchange,
the company’s revenue grew
39%, significantly slower than
the 48% growth rate in the
third quarter, Mahaney said.
The company’s internation-
al-business growth rate also
appeared to lag most expec-
tations.
EBay shares plunged 12%,
to $90.92 in after-hours trad-
ing, after falling $3.32 in 4
pm Nasdaq composite trad-
ing. However, EBay shares
soared 80% last year, briefly
giving the ten-year-old com-
pany a market value of more
than $75 billion.
Despite the concerns about
slowing growth, eBay has
been benefitting from the
growing popularity of internet
shopping. Consumers spent
$15.8 billion on the web during
the November and December
holiday season, up 29% from
the previous year, according
to comScore Networks Inc., a
market-research firm. EBay,
which began promoting itself
a few years ago through
holiday television and print
advertising, has become an
increasingly important web
destination for consumers
shopping for holiday gifts.
“Online is becoming a key
component of holiday shop-
ping,” said Rajiv Dutta,
eBay’s CFO. The company
has been adding and promot-
ing features to help holiday
shoppers, such as its “Buy
it now” feature that allows
users to buy an item for a set
price, without waiting for the
close of an auction.
EBay executives remain
confident enough to increase
investment plans for this
year to more than $300 mil-
lion from an original $200
million. Dutta said much of
the additional money would
be directed at eBay’s PayPal
payment-processing unit and
its relatively new China oper-
ation. Dutta also said eBay
will accelerate its expansion
of PayPal internationally by
introducing the service in
more countries, and invest
$100 million in China, the
world’s fastest growing econ-
omy. “We see even greater
opportunity in China today
than we did six months ago,”
said Chief Executive Officer
Meg Whitman.
EBay also declared a 2-for-1
stock split to shareholders of
record on 31 January.
Revenue from eBay’s US
auctions business, its biggest
unit, rose 24% to $362.7 mil-
lion. Revenue from the inter-
national auctions business
rose 64% to $344.3 million.
Revenue from PayPal rose
53% to $200.2 million.
For 2004, eBay reported net
income of $778.2 million, or
$1.14 a share, compared with
net income of $441.8 million,
or 67 cents, a year earlier.
Revenue climbed 51% to $3.27
billion, from $2.17 billion;
slightly higher than the com-
pany’s previous forecast of
$3.25 billion.
Motorola
Motorola Inc., the US tele-
com-equipment maker, said
its share of the global market
for mobile phones surged in
the fourth quarter because
of a large rollout of handsets
loaded with new features.
The company said its net
income soared 34% to $654
million from $489 million a
year earlier.
Chairman and CEO Ed
Zander, who took over the top
position at Motorola a year
ago, said the new models
helped increase the compa-
ny’s global handset market
share to 16.6%, compared
with 13.7% a year earlier and
13.4% in the third quarter.
Nokia, of Finnish origins,
has the largest share with
31.4% as of the third quar-
ter, according to IDC, a tech-
nology research firm. Nokia
will report its fourth-quarter
earnings later this month
which should go some way in
revealing how well the intro-
duction of its 7260 and 6670
have gone.
Motorola apparently has
regained the number two
ranking after conceding that
spot earlier in 2004 to South
Korea’s Samsung Electronics
Co. Samsung has stumbled
recently, with reportings from
last week indicating that its
net profit in the fourth quar-
ter fell 2% as margins tight-
ened.
Motorola reported revenue
of $8.84 billion in the quar-
ter, a 27% increase from a
year earlier. The company’s
overall performance, which
exceeded market expecta-
tions, was driven by strong
sales in the handset division,
which accounts for about 40%
of its total revenue. Motorola
shipped 31.8 million handsets
in the quarter, a 42% increase
from the fourth quarter a year
earlier.
The fourth quarter is criti-
cal because holiday sales can
make or break the whole year
and can determine momen-
tum going into the new year.
A year ago, Motorola stum-
bled badly in the quarter,
when several key handsets
didn’t reach the market.
Yahoo
Yahoo, the Californian
internet company, reported
a fourth-quarter profit nearly
quintupled from a year earlier
as it continued to benefit from
a surge in online advertising.
Thefirmclaimednetincome
rising to $373 million (25 cents
per share) from $75 million (5
cents per share) a year ear-
lier. Revenues rose 62% to an
astounding $1.1 billion from
$664 million. Not including
profits from the sale of shares
in Google Inc by Yahoo dur-
ing the quarter, Yahoo’s profit
would have been $187 mil-
lion (13 cents per share). That
exceeded the earnings of 11
cents per share expected by
many senior analysts. Also,
excluding commissions paid
to marketing partners, Yahoo
reported revenues of $75 mil-
lion above the company’s pro-
jection of $710 million. Yahoo’s
Chairman and CEO, Terry
Semel, called 2004 “the year
in which we witnessed the
beginning of a tipping point in
advertising,” with more main-
stream advertisers increas-
ing their marketing online.
Advertising-related rev-
enue rose 67% from a year
earlier and accounted for 85%
of Yahoo’s revenue, the same
as the previous quarter when
compared with like-for-like
sales. Semel also said both of
Yahoo’s major ad categories
– search-related advertising
and brand advertising such as
banner ads – grew strongly.
Yahoo has profited from
a broader rebirth in online
advertising driven partly by
search-related ads. US online
advertising revenue, for both
Yahoo and its rivals, totalled
more than $6.8 billion in the
first three quarters of 2004;
nearlyequallingthe$7.3billion
spent in all of 2003, according
to trade group the Interactive
Advertising Bureau. Online
ad revenue last year could
exceed the $8 billion in 2000,
the biggest year before the
recent slump. Yahoo’s gains
in search-related advertising
are “volume-driven”; revenue
per search was flat from the
previous quarter, but the
number of search queries
conducted on Yahoo and its
affiliate sites increased in the
“double digits” from a year
earlier. Yahoo attributed the
per-search pricing trends to a
seasonal surge in retail-relat-
ed advertising, which gener-
ally requires lower rates.
Non-advertising revenue at
Yahoo rose 40%, although it
still remained a small share
of the total. Yahoo’s fees for
its premium offerings, such
as broadband services bun-
dled with high-speed internet
access, climbed 52% to $129
million. Yahoo claims a client
base of 8.4 million fee-paying
customers at the end of the
quarter, compared with 7.6
million in the third quarter.
Revenue from listings, such
as help-wanted ads, also rose
15% to $38 million. Yahoo’s
international revenue, out-
side of its US home, surged to
$303 million. At 28% of sales,
that revenue represented the
same portion of sales as in
the third quarter.
