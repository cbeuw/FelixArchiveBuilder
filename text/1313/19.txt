After the excitement of my last trip
to the opera (that would be the time
when we went to hear Bryn Terfel’s
Wotan and ended up seeing him
mime to Donald MacIntyre’s ren-
dition of the role from the orches-
tra pit), this was somewhat more
sedate.
As always, we went to the Royal
Opera House, (I know, I should prob-
ably try to get some variety, but I
can’t help it, I am a creature of habit
and the routine we have for our eve-
nings at the opera works so well),
this time to enjoy some Puccini.
The royal opera is currently in the
middle of a run of performances
of the composer’s legendary work,
Turandot.
For those of you less familiar with
the works of Puccini, here’s a brief
synopsis of the action; for those of
you who are more aware of Puccini’s
plots I’m sure you’ll recognise his
general disregard for watertight
storylines.
Turandot is the cruel daughter
of the Chinese Emperor who has
decreed that she will only marry
the man who can solve her three
riddles. Any man who takes up the
challenge and fails is to be behead-
ed. The story begins in a crowd
before the execution of one unfor-
tunate failure; among the crowd
are Calaf, Timur and Liu. Timur,
the blind and very fragile deposed
king of an undisclosed kingdom, has
been travelling in search of a new
life guided by Liu, a faithful former
slave of the royal household who
secretly loves Calaf, the king’s son
whom they had presumed dead.
In what is possibly one of the
most stupendous coincidences in all
opera, Calaf and Timur are reunited
within the first ten minutes of the
score. Following the touching reun-
ion,Turandotmakesherfirstappear-
ance to confirm that the execution is
to take place, Calaf is reviled by
her lack of mercy and compassion,
but then he sees her from afar and
instantly falls in love with her. Calaf
now must have Turandot, and so
takes up the challenge of the riddles
with a complete disregard for what
impact his possible failure could
have on his already very ill father.
Liu’s pleadings, which take the form
of a spectacularly touching aria, fall
on deaf ears.
As can be expected, the riddles
are no match for our hero’s superior
intellect. Preceding the unveiling of
the riddles, Turandot has her turn
to sing her heart out as she explains
why she is so cruel. Following her
riddle’s defeat by Calaf, she tries to
beg her father to let her renege on
her promise to marry the man that
solves the riddles, but the emperor
tells her to stop whining. Calaf, in
his eternal stupidity, offers Turandot
a deal: he will gladly be executed if
she can find out his name by dawn.
Turandot uses her power to force
her subjects to search high and low
for the stranger’s name; Calaf sits
gloating that at dawn he will win
the woman of his dreams in the
infamous Nessun Dorma aria. The
reverie is broken up as townspeo-
ple and imperial guards try eve-
rything to force him to give up his
name, including threatening Timur
and Liu. This is where Calaf really
proves his worthlessness; Liu sings
another beautiful aria explaining to
Turandot how she is prepared to die
for her love if it will give him happi-
ness, she then kills herself. Timur
is distraught; Calaf only gives her
sacrifice a few moments of his time
before he continues his wooing of
the woman of no redeeming quali-
ties, Turandot. Evidently there will
be another crisis before following on
to a relatively happy ending where
love has conquered even Turandot’s
impressive ego issues.
Unlike the Ring cycle, this is a
much more traditional production,
where the scenery and the cos-
tumes as well as the action have
been designed to fit with the peri-
od in which the opera is supposed
to take place. The production is
already 20 years old, having being
premiered at the Los Angeles opera
in 1984. Unlike the production of
Saint-Saens’ Samson et Dalila from
approximately the same period that
graced the stage at Covent Garden
last year, this production has aged
really rather well. While Samson et
Dalila looked dated, Turandot still
looked creative and visually strik-
ing.
Overall, the opera was enjoyable
– the music is wonderfully melodic
and there are so many wonderful
arias in the score that you would
really have to try hard to massa-
cre it. There are essentially two
casts – for the principal roles of
Calaf, Liu and Turandot there are
two singers each. I had the pleas-
ure of seeing Vladimir Galouzine,
Andrea Gruber and Hei-Kyung
Hong as Calaf, Turandot and Liu.
As an ensemble they were good,
however, the real star of the show
was Hei-Kyung Hong. She was spec-
tacular, both technically and theatri-
cally. Galouzine unfortunately had no dynamic range, his only dynamic
being forte, and Gruber managed to
avoid conveying any of Turandot’s
potentially redeeming qualities; her
voice was harsh, and during her
aria where she explains why she
has enforced the ‘solve them or die’
policy with respect to the riddles,
she failed utterly to convince that
her character had any humanity or
that indeed her reasons for her deci-
sion had any grounds at all.
My only complaint about the pro-
ductionitselfisaboutthestagedirec-
tions given to Turandot. Whenever
she was to make an important point,
she was made to raise her arms and
spread them and then to stick her
head forward; the effect was rather
comical. Instead of looking authori-
tative she just looked like a vulture,
and the constant repetition did not
help make any point whatsoever.
I realise that some of my com-
ments have tended towards the neg-
ative, but let me reassure you that
an evening spent at Covent Garden
at a performance of Turandot will
not be a wasted one. Despite his
uni-dynamical style, Galouzine does
do a good job with Nessun Dorma,
and Hong is stupendous. One can
only hope that Cellia Rose does a
comparable job in the role of Liu
as she takes over for the last three
performances.
One final remark: whatever the
failings of Puccini’s plots, they
never fail to move you. Liu’s tragi-
cally unappreciated sacrifice is
heart rendering, Cio-Cio-San’s bro-
ken heart in Madama Butterfly will
shatter yours in a thousand pieces
and Mimi’s final moments are drip-
ping in pathos. Of Puccini’s seven
full-length opera’s, here I’m defin-
ing that as being more than one
Act in duration, only one ends hap-
pily, La Fanciulla Del West, and
the rest will have you in tears. In
a rather Puccini-laden season at
the Royal Opera, there are many
opportunities to go and get thor-
oughly depressed. Up-coming
works include Madama Butterlfy
and La Boheme. La Boheme should
be spectacular, with the role of Mimi
being shared by Angela Gheorghiu
and Liping Zhang, two sopranos
with very different styles but with
equally stunning voices and stage
presences.
