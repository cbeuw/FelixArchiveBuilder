Following a highly unpopu-
lar change to monthly pay in
December, students who work
part time for Imperial College
will be paid on a weekly basis
again from 1 March.
A considerable proportion
of Imperial students work for
the College part time, in areas
ranging from Conferences to
the students’ union.
The original change to
monthly pay was made in
order to cut costs and make
it easier for the College to co-
ordinate payments. Student
staff complained about a
range of issues, including a
lack of communication, insuf-
ficient compensation pay-
ments, short notice, incorrect
tax deductions and the fact
that some non-student staff
were still being paid weekly.
Some workers even quit their
jobs as a result.
However, the College’s
Operations Committee
reversed the decision. One
student, who has worked for
the College for two years,
cautiously welcomed the
news: “We’re all incredibly
pleased, but as far as I’m
concerned they should never
have moved us off weekly pay
in the first place. Perhaps in
future these decisions should
be made at higher levels and
after the students have been
consulted.”
Mustafa Arif, President of
Imperial College Union, told
Felix: “The situation with
part time student staff has
been unfortunate, and I hope
those who have been incon-
venienced will be compensat-
ed appropriately.
“It’s great that the College
has finally realised that part
time staff should be paid
weekly, and I hope all the
problems can be sorted out
very soon.”
Malcolm Aldridge, the
College’sFinancialController,
said: “It was acknowledged
that paying students on a
monthly cycle was leading to
recruitment problems in our
organisation.”
Meanwhile, the introduc-
tion of new computer soft-
ware has caused yet more
payroll difficulties, with some
systems unavailable for eight
days in early February. This
has inconvenienced line
managers, who have had to
process payroll details earlier
than expected.
Immigration issues
The Conservative Party’s
recent proposal to introduce
a quota system on asylum
seekers has sparked a heat-
ed debate. Felix looks at the
national newspapers’ views
on this contentious issue.

Student struck by taxi as
politicians consider ‘naked roads’
By Dave Edwards
An Imperial College stu-
dent was hit by a taxi on a
pedestrian crossing close to
Exhibition Road, which may
soon be stripped of all its traf-
fic lights, signs and crossings
under new proposals.
The student, Dan Houcke,
who is in the fourth year of
a mechanical engineering
degree, was crossing Prince
Consort Road on Tuesday
lunchtime when he was hit by
the car. He was unhurt. The
driver of the taxi blamed Mr
Houcke for the collision and
attempted to place him under
a citizen’s arrest. Police were
called to the scene, where
they questioned the two men
but took no further action.
Mr Houcke told Felix: “I was
walking across the pedestri-
an crossing. He was probably
doing well over 30mph.”
A short distance away,
Exhibition Road is set to
be the site of a pilot ‘traf-
fic calming’ scheme, in
which all markings would be
removed and no-one would
have automatic right of way.
Pedestrians would be able to
cross the road anywhere, and
a 20mph speed limit could
be introduced. The scheme
would be part of a £25m rede-
velopment of the area.
The idea has been used suc-
cessfully in Holland and is
also being trialled in Seend,
Wiltshire. Its supporters
claim that it encourages driv-
ers to slow down and take
more notice of pedestrians.
Wiltshire County Council
says that accidents in Seend
have fallen by a third and the
average driving speed has
dropped by 5% since roads’
central white lines were
removed.
However, the scheme has
received widespread criti-
cism. Edmund King, execu-
tive director of the RAC, said:
“Although this might make
drivers more careful, it could
also encourage the aggres-
sive motorist to behave more
recklessly. We would certainly
question whether this type of
experiment should be imple-
mented on a wider scale.”
Mr Houcke, following his
encounter with the taxi, said
of the ‘naked road’ scheme:
“I wouldn’t have thought it
would work, considering peo-
ple cross the road so frequent-
ly and drivers go so fast.”
Sam Rorke, Deputy
President (Education and
Welfare) of Imperial College
Union, told Felix: “We [the
Union] are excited to see if it
works, but concerned about
possible safety implications
for students, given the large
number needing to cross
Exhibition Road. Personally
I’ve seen a lot of dangerous
drivers in the area”.
A decision on the future of
Exhibition Road will be made
in the next few months.
Mechanical engineering student Dan Houcke answers questions from police after being
hit by a taxi on Prince Consort Road on Tuesday. Proposals to remove all traffic lights,
kerbs, crossings and signs from nearby Exhibition Road are being considered by
Kensington and Chelsea Council, with a decision expected in the next few months
