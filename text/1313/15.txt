ALBUM REVIEW
Most of you have probably heard
Mixmaster Mike’s work before, even
if you have no idea who he is. As
the long term collaborator with the
Beastie Boys, his DJing provided
the addictive beats for widespread
hits such as Intergalactic, and the
recent screeching rhythm for the
Beastie’s latest album To The Five
Boroughs. Also a stand-alone DJ,
here he presents his latest solo
work, Bangzilla.
The whole album is a nostalgic
throwback in two respects. First
it takes the eighties approach to
hip-hop (think earlier acts like
M.A.R.R.S.), throwing together
quickfire samples to create a jumpy
beat. And secondly, the album is
centred on a sci-fi theme, sampling
old movies and news stories to cre-
ate his unique warped audio comic
strip. Elements of B-movies, Star
Trek and various tales of spacemen
are all present, though unfortunate-
ly there’s no Dr. Who.
Beginning with Trigger Man, a
chorus of violins and dodgy trumpets
straight out of any fifties sci-fi movie
breaks down into a moody beat com-
plete with ‘red alert’ alarms, a rum-
bling bass line and Mike’s traditional
manic scratching. From then on, the
samples come thick and fast. The
main mixes give a blend of trippy
beats and attention-grabbing bursts
of quick screeching; they pierce the
airwaves and demand your atten-
tion, similar to the beat Mike used
in the recent Beastie Boys hit, Ch-
Check It Out. You’re always kept
on your toes due to the changing
rhythms and samples, such as the
sudden breakout into foreign pop on
Marvel, or the conclusion to MJ-12
Strike, when swirling violins provide
a backdrop to a shootout.
The strengths of the album, how-
ever, also provide its weaknesses.
As it is essentially a quick fire sam-
ple album, there are several dull-
ing moments where the continuing
scratching and sample-changing
start to grate. In some places the
album needs a bit more substance,
perhaps requiring a leaf out of DJ
Shadow’s book with an attempt
at using the samples to create a
melody; or inviting in his old pals
to provide some lyrics to go along
with the mix. It’s a weakness that
rarely occurs though, and you’re left
with a mostly solid hip-hop album,
demanding constant attention until
the very last beat with its addictive
pace and unique sound structure.
Finally, it’s refreshing to see that
in the age of sixth form poetry and
a polarised music industry, we can
still get an album that doesn’t take
itself too seriously. I mean – why
else would you call it Bangzilla?

LIVE REVIEW
My brother said: “You’ll know you’re
there when someone approaches
you offering curry”. It’s almost a
package deal: curry and live music
on Brick Lane. But it wasn’t the
curry that did it for me – singer-
songwriter James Blunt is an awe-
some new talent and a really nice
guy too.
We were there to interview James
and to confirm he is every bit as
good live as his debut album Back
To Bedlam. On his sell-out band
residency at 93 Feet East (running
on three consecutive Wednesdays),
James modestly told us he has a
‘big family’, but it’s not true. The
venue was packed, both with the
public school types he grew up with
at Harrow School, and the usual die-
hard fans who scorn anyone who
dare utter a word during the set
(including me passing comment at
James’s incredible voice!)
Despite his enthusiasm for the
support act, Luane Parle was lit-
tle more than a Shania Twain trib-
ute band; just not my cup of tea.
But it wasn’t long until James, with
his drummer going mental in the
background, let rip with new song
Dancing Days before introducing
himself and offering his services
for Bar Mitvahs and threesomes.
The set then started properly with
brilliant album opener and current
single High.
Sadly the dodgy acoustics com-
bined with much chat at the back
(no, it wasn’t me this time) let
James down during No Bravery, a
song written during and about his
time serving in Kosovo. (We asked
to see the bullet-ridden guitar but it
suffered an unfortunate motorbike
accident in front of the EMI bosses.)
However, there was no stopping the
crowd joining in with So Long Jimmy
and I got all excited with second new
song I Really Want You – I can bare-
ly wait for his new album. Saving
the best until last, James finished
up with You’re Beautiful, a truly
pretty song about an ex-girlfriend,
followed by Wisemen, my personal
favourite. Then, all too soon, it was
home time.
He’s been compared to Damien
Rice, Van Morrison, and Counting
Crows; that’s some list, but James
Blunt deserves the association. His
rather unconventional route into
the music industry is reflected in
some top-class lyrics which, com-
bined with acoustic brilliance and an
amazing voice, leave me begging for
more. Watch out for Wisemen to be
released on 7 March, but if, like me,
you can’t wait, go out and get the
album – it won’t leave your stereo
in a hurry.

SINGLE REVIEWS
Those expecting another Pounding
so to speak, be disappointed. Doves
have obviously realised that dance
music is dead and now want to do
their part in reminding people why
it died.
The early nineties semi-Italian
house piano is a nice touch but
only serves to irritate after a while.
Luckily they try to over-shadow
such an obvious mistake by putting
in fuzz-laden guitars all over the
place alongside an up-tempo rock
beat. Of course, lead singer Jimi
tries his hardest to cover it up with
his trademark Manc mope and at
times the track feels compelling and
even worthy of dancing to. But as
you begin to forgive the elements
of mediocrity and lack of any sig-
nificant idea to latch onto, a wimpy
guitar solo makes an appearance.
And when I mean wimpy, I mean
taken from the You Can Play Blues
Guitar Too 3 handbook wimpy. Must
try harder! Matty Hoban
Yeah but why? Just why? There’s
no need. Ambulance Ltd are indie
made boring to the extreme. These
pale-faced bedwetters are afraid to
make their song Stay Where You
Are do anything. I can’t believe that
someone would fund the release of
this. I mean, it’s not offensive, it’s
not really unpleasant, but it’s not
something that should have been
released as a single. It consists of
one long verse.
Ambulance Ltd will probably
next be seen supporting Embrace
in your local pub when the world
realises what a mistake their latest
comeback was. Stay Where You Are
is like one of those instrumental
filler tracks on albums by genius
post-metal bands like Oceansize, or
recent Radiohead albums, that you
cherish because the previous song
made your brain leak out of your
ear. The previous song I listened
to was the Fierce Girl single. And
I still think this track is awful. Go
figure. James Millen
