DEMO REVIEW
With the Brits only weeks away, the
musical silly season is thankfully
coming to an end. Say goodbye to
last year’s tedium (more common-
ly known as Roosta, Kasabian and
Keane) and say hello to London’s
hottest live act, the brilliant General
Khaki.
Formed from the ashes of General
Tommy Mack’s previous outfit, The
Shakes, General Khaki are a force to
be reckoned with, offering the most
original and compelling take on
garage rock since the White Stripes.
With influences ranging from the
Clash to Captain Beefheart and the
Beach Boys, General Khaki deliver
their most captivating introducto-
ry message with immense wit at
breakneck speed.
Their live demo, comprising seven
minutes of pure sonic assault,
starts with the General’s self-
promoting opening shot Give Us
The Bullets And We’ll Shoot The
Guns, a garage-punk frenzy deliv-
ered with seriousness and army-
march style drums timed to preci-
sion by Daniel Mack. Endearing to
the end, the ironic yet ska-tinged
Animal displays the Khakis’ more
flippant slower side, with kooky lyr-
ics to put a smile on both the listener
and Lance Bombardier Kat Stevens’
face.
Good Guys And Bad Guys is the
band on top form: catchy, dance-
able and taking a well-deserved pot-
shot at Dubya and his futile war on
Islam: “You can tell a bad guy with a
beard and a moustache, he likes to
ride a camel and he likes to smoke
hash.” The EP is rounded off with
the fantastic Stone Roses inspired
Swagger, the track to epitomise
what rock and roll should be – irrev-
erent, sexy, brooding and command-
ing, whilst letting the listener have
an excellent time.
“Show us your swagger” and
General Khaki will show you the
way. Take the draft at www.gener-

SINGLE REVIEWS
At the end of the day, truly great
music can either be put down to its
context or its timelessness. Music
that may not stand the test of time
may be great purely because it
saved everyone’s life from Travis
and inspired a generation to back
away from the acoustic guitar. Right
now, we’re truly in the middle of an
amplified music scene with every-
one picking up guitars and shout-
ing the immortal lines of Art Brut:
“Look at us! We formed a band!”
But wonderful bands such as the
Futureheads also follow the tire-
some likes of The Others. So which
category do Stoke-on-Trent’s Agent
Blue fall under? If this single is any-
thing to go by then they could soon
be up there with the best of them.
Singer Nick Andrews does a nice
Joe Strummer via Sam Herlihy
(Hope Of The States) impression
when he spits condemnation upon
our generation: “What will you tell
your children’s children when they
ask where have their homes gone? /
Will you tell them you lit the fires?”
The music never feels stagnant
and resembles Bloc Party in its
driving and climactic guitar
dualism. It may feel predictable at
turns but that’s only because you’re
hearing what you want to hear:
inspired music by individuals with a
message. Matty Hoban
I picked up this record because it
said “Horny Pony” on the front. I’m
yet to work out why; I think it may be
their PR company. With a name like
Fierce Girl, I was expecting shonky
Camden indie whores with too much
eye makeup and little or no knowl-
edge of how a guitar works, except
that when you do this it makes a
really loud noise. In short, I was
expecting it to be awesome.
But oh dear no. It’s actually two
chavs singing about other chavs,
and being general obnoxious chav
bastards over crap chavvy dance
beats. I bravely put on my investi-
gative journalist hat and Googled
them. When asked in an interview as
to what was currently floating their
boat, they listed “Tanya Turner, The
Cock, Marlboro Lights, Peaches,
Lucy Liu, Burberry, Bad Girls, Vin
Diesel, Horsemeat Disco, any kind
of beer, White Van Men, Aaliyah, but
most of all... Kat Slater.” They are
even worse than suggested by the
NME, who (thinking that this was
a compliment) described them as
a mix between Fischerspooner and
The Streets. Unholy.
I looked at the video and it was the
two skinheads who make up Fierce
Girl waving their hands aggressively
at the screen for three minutes and
33 seconds. This is the soundtrack to
you getting knifed. And I’m guessing
that that is not a pleasant occur-
rence, but then again neither is this
record. James Millen
