How far would you go to save
your brother’s life? If he was
sitting in the room next to
yours, quietly enduring one
of many painful blood trans-
fusions, waiting for a dona-
tion, would you not open the
door to help him? Now imag-
ine that you owed your exist-
ence to him. That somebody
else had you born so that a
part of you would provide a
cure for your brother’s ill-
ness. Imagine that you could
actually have been a different
person altogether, but instead
you were ‘planned’ to be a
certain way. Could this be a
step too far?
There’s an ongoing heated
debate about the use of con-
troversial genetic screening
techniques by couples want-
ing to save the life of a ter-
minally ill child by creating
a ‘designer’ sibling to act as
a stem cell donor. You may
have heard about the Hashmi
family from Leeds, whose
five-year-old son Zain has had
over 100 blood transfusions
due to a potentially fatal blood
disorder, Beta Thalassaemia.
This condition could be treat-
ed by a stem cell transplant,
but the failure to find a suit-
able donor with a compatible
blood group forced the family
to consider alternatives. The
possibility of conceiving a new
baby, who could then act as a
donor for their ill son, arose.
The new infant would be
conceived by In-Vitro fer-
tilisation (IVF) followed by
Preimplantation Genetic
Diagnosis (PGD) to ensure
compatibility with Zain’s
blood type. PGD evaluates
the genetic characteristics of
three-day-old embryos before
they are implanted in the
mother’s womb. In this case,
the embryos would only be
selected should they prove to
be a match for their future
brother. Any other embryos
would be discarded.
PGD is not a new tech-
nique; it has been used since
the 1980s in over 2500 differ-
ent situations worldwide. It
is used by families that risk
the conception of a child
with a serious genetic condi-
tion, such as Cystic Fibrosis
or Beta Thalassaemia. The
technique was deemed to
be controversial as it led to
the discarding of embryos,
an act considered as murder
by groups that believe that
a human life is formed upon
conception. These opposing
voices were quietened down,
however, by the conclusion
that the born child would ben-
efit directly from the use of
such a technique, which has
been in use in the UK since
the early 1990s.
However, in the case of the
Hashmi family, it is not the
unborn child that benefits
from this application of PGD.
When embryos are selected,
those being discarded might
be healthy embryos that
unfortunately do not match
the blood type of their sibling
and are therefore denied the
chance to live. This was the
price to pay in exchange for
saving little Zain’s life. The
debate rages on, as there is
controversy regarding wheth-
er this is too high a price to
pay.
The court’s decision to have
the operation funded by the
NHS has forced this highly
topical issue into the public
eye. This type of operation
can be required by as much
as two dozen couples each
year, at a cost of £20,000 for
the four rounds of procedures
that are often required. From
a purely economical point of
view, the NHS might profit
from such procedures if we
were to compare them with
the price of lifetime treatment
for a patient suffering from
Thalassaemia, which nears
the £1m mark. But money is
not the main issue here.
Ethically speaking, the wel-
fare of the unborn child is the
main issue that causes con-
cern. If the child was born but
unexpectedlyfailedtoproduce
a suitable cure for its brother,
how would that be regarded
by the parents? Would the
child be conceived simply as a
means to save a life, or would
it be fully accepted as part of
the family? It can be argued
that the reason for having
a child by all couples is not
always perfectly selfless, and
indeed some couples’ motiva-
tion to have a child naturally
may be deemed as unethical
(having a child to save a mar-
riage, for example). But then
again, not all couples ask for
public funds for such causes.
Another source of concern is
the fear that this could be the
beginning of a ‘slippery slope’,
the road that leads to eugen-
ics. The genetic improvement
of humans and the generation
of super-human “designer
babies” is still very far from
being technically feasible,
but for certain sectors of the
public, genetic screening of
embryos is the thin edge of a
very large wedge. Regulatory
bodies such as the Human
Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority serve to prevent
such events by monitoring
PGD on a case by case basis,
but there has certainly been a
relaxation in the laws.
When considering all these
factors we must take into
account what is achieved by
the technique. In this case,
unless a suitable donor is
found, the only alternative is
for Zain to lead a life of hospi-
tals and endless blood transfu-
sions. A ‘saviour sibling’ could
be born instead, to provide
him with healthy stem cells
and give him a chance at ‘real’
life. We cannot know if the
family will welcome the child
in its own right or whether
he will be treated as a con-
venience. In the same way,
only time will tell whether
this is the road to eugenics
and “designer babies”. At the
moment, a little boy needs aid
and it is within our capacity to
help him.

Perfect antidotes: placebos and nocebos
By Giovanna Larice
Biochemistry department
Several studies have shown
that placebos, Latin for “I
shall please”, may actually do
more than that and improve
health.
The placebo effect, an
observable or felt improve-
ment of health not ascribable
to an active drug, has been
known for some time now.
Long term medical research
has suggested that some
sick people feel better after
taking a ‘dummy pill’ simply
because they think it is real
medicine.
Until now, the placebo
effect has been assumed
to be psychological, with
patients simply believing that
they are feeling better, yet
recent studies have unveiled
a direct biochemical basis
to the phenomenon. A real
chemical response may actu-
ally be occurring in patients.
Experimental results released
this year on Parkinson’s dis-
ease showed that the neurons
of patients receiving a simple
salt solution at the University
of Turin in Italy responded in
the same way as when they
had received an active drug
that had earlier eased their
symptoms.
Evidence for a biochemical
basis of the placebo effect has
also been observed in patients
suffering from depression.
Doctors have known for years
that many depressed patients
report improvements in their
mood after being given pla-
cebos (such as sugar pills)
but only of late have place-
bos been associated with a
change in brain function. This
suggests that placebos may
represent an active treatment
condition. Research conduct-
ed by the psychiatrist Andrew
F. Leuchter and published
in the American Journal of
Psychiatry in January 2002
was the first to show that
patients with severe depres-
sion show alterations in brain
functioning improvement irre-
spective of whether the drug
is placebo or active.
According to Mr Leuchter,
the hope associated with the
potential for a treatment’s
effectiveness and the convic-
tion of taking a real drug, along
with positive interactions with
the health providers, may
all contribute to the placebo
effect by having a significant
biochemical effect. Sensory
experience and thoughts are
known to affect neurochem-
istry, which in turn is able to
affect other biochemical sys-
tems such as the immune sys-
tem. It follows that a person’s
mood may psychosomatically
affect their wellbeing or ability
to recover from illness.
A tantalizingquestion is then
raised: do patients who benefit
from taking antidepressants
do so thanks to the pill itself
or simply to the act of taking
a pill?
All the same, many medi-
cal ethicists, such as Howard
Brody of Michingan State
University, believe that admin-
istering a placebo to a patient
in the old-fashioned way is
deceptive, unethical, and
in most cases should not be
done. Mr Brody takes it one
step further and claims that
the placebo effect need not
depend on making use of a
placebo at all and can instead
simply be achieved by positive
feelings created in the health
care environment.
Other researchers suggest
that the mysterious placebo
effect can be used in conjunc-
tion with other medicines and
harnessed to improve drug
efficacy - for example, by pre-
senting drugs to patients in
an optimistic and encourag-
ing light. Ethical problems
may arise however, if doctors
fail to elucidate all possible
side effects in an attempt to
manipulate a patient’s view on
the drug.
The placebo’s wicked double
is the altogether less notorious
nocebo, Latin for “I will harm”.
This is a harmless treatment
that induces harmful effects
in a patient due to negative
expectations or the psycho-
logical condition of the patient.
The term nocebo became
popular in the 1990s, when
scientists wanted to under-
stand the factors that lead to
negative effects in treatments,
such as non-specific medica-
tion side effects. Unlike its
virtuous twin, a nocebo isn’t
generally a medication, but
an influence (such as a belief,
certain cultural factors, or a
mindset). Furthermore, noce-
bos are far less well-docu-
mented in scientific literature,
as ethical concerns prevent
them from being regularly
used in research and in medi-
cal practice.
Nonetheless, some stud-
ies have been carried out to
support the nocebo theory. In
the Framingham study for the
20-year incidence of myocar-
dial infarction and coronary
death, data showed that, inde-
pendently of commonly recog-
nised factors that may lead to
coronary death, women who
believed they were more likely
to experience a heart attack
were actually 3.7 times more
likely to do so than women
that had no such belief.
Are common expressions
such as ‘scared to death’ and
‘worried sick’ that have long
been part of our vocabulary
just mere exaggerations, or do
they represent an underlying
realisation of the significance
of mind over matter?
Modern scientists should be
less ignorant of the fascinating
power our psyches can have
over our health and wellbeing,
and should learn to merge the
body and mind in order to har-
ness these amazing phenom-
ena to our advantage.

benefit from taking
antidepressants do so

Placebo: awful band, but recent research trials have
shown their biochemical effectiveness in medicine
