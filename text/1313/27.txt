Imperial Women’s 1st 17
King’s Women’s 1st 4
By Michelle Maloney
First, a little background to
the situation: we were meant
to play King’s last term at
the lacrosse team’s debut at
Harlington, but King’s turned
up an hour and a quarter late.
They did not like the decision
that we would take the walko-
ver and spurned our offer of a
friendly match. Complaints to
BUSA and cock-ups with fax
machines resulted in us hav-
ing to rematch at the neutral
ground of UCL. In order to
patch up the King’s-IC rela-
tion, a men’s friendly was
organised for the same time.
Things did not get off to the
best of starts when we turned
up at Shenley and none of the
groundsmen knew that we
werecoming.Luckilytheyhad
one pitch already set up and
so the girls could play their
BUSA match. Unfortunately,
the boys had to make do with
a football pitch.
The King’s mixed team had
thrashed us last term and we
had no idea of the standard
of their ladies’ team, so no
excuses were accepted for
absence. The umpire seemed
slightly confused by our deci-
sion to play boundaries but
no restraining lines, but it
suited all the oldies in our
team just fine. Imperial won
the toss (or hide the whistle
as it seems to have become...)
and we opted to shoot uphill
for the first half. I have to
say that personally I have
never, ever been more nerv-
ous at the start of a Lacrosse
match – we are in with a
strong chance of winning the
league and everybody wanted
revenge for King’s previous
whinging and general skul-
duggery.
Jeanette won the first draw
and the ball was swiftly taken
down to King’s end (for some
bizarre reason their goalie
wasn’t yet on the pitch) but
some good defending from
them sent it back up the other
way. Imperial were solid with
Annie at Point and Sabrina at
Cover, yet swift with Hannah
C and Mary defending on the
wing (like a battering ram on
greased weasel shit).
It was initially a bit sticky
around midfield, but Caroline
went on one of her trademark
mad dashes and shot a peach
of a goal. That seemed to spur
the rest of Imperial’s goals-
coring machine into action
and two more goals quickly
followed. After some substitu-
tions (eating my own weight
in mince pies over Christmas
may not have been the best
idea) the goals kept coming.
The boys, by this point, had
gone off to have a men’s train-
ing session and mini match.
It was quite amusing watch-
ing the fear in their eyes as
the King’s men ‘kitted up’ in
helmets and pads... but back
to the ladies’ game.
A momentary lack in con-
centration from the defence
allowed King’s to sneak
one in, which was a bit of
a shame; their side of the
umpire’s card was so lovely
and clear.
Half time came and it was
8-1 to Imperial. Doing our
best not to get too excited
and with only minimal
squealing, we regrouped to
discuss tactics. Wise words
were spoken (“if we can get
eight goals in one half so can
they”, “play as if it is 0-0”,
“we’ve really pissed them
off now”) but couldn’t dis-
pel the glee that we were all
feeling. Consequently, when
we got back on the pitch we
were not together and Kings
quickly scored. This was not
part of the plan. Nor was
them scoring another goal,
quite controversially – even
some King’s players thought
it didn’t go in, a couple of
minutes later.
It brought us back to earth
with a bump and our play
picked up again. Caroline,
Mary, Jeanette our goalscor-
ers were numerous... and Ms
Hannah Readman was on fire
with a couple of really sneaky
underarm shots. Being in
defence for Imperial was
slightly boring in the second
part of this half – all of the
play was at the other end.
Watching one of the King’s
players making a run and
shooting at her own goal was
quite amusing though.
King’s last goal of the match
was again controversial: one
of their players steamed down
the pitch ‘through’ Hannah C
to score. The umpire allowed
the goal to stand even though
the scorer had smacked
Hannah in the face as she
shot, causing Hannah to bite
through her lip. Thank good-
ness for gumshields.
The match ended 17-4 to
us – they should have settled
for a walkover after all. We
were just finishing the usual
jolly hockey sticks hurrah-
ing and hand shaking when
Tim came over and told us
that one of the King’s boys
had broken his collar bone, so
would Annie mind (as most
senior medic) coming and
taking a look at him. Whoops.
Still, I think that generally a
fine day was had by all.
Young, cold and in with a chance of winning the league: Imperial’s women’s lacrosse team
Thanks and apologies to Alex Khalifa, who pointed out the mistake in last week’s Quick Crossword.
The answers were meant to be ‘Theorems’ and ‘Tramp’, but they didn’t intersect properly. Sorry!
