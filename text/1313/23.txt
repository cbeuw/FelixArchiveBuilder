Hey there Coffee fans! Apologies for the cheesiness of the intro, but this is by far the hardest part
of the page to write. Anyway, two things for you to do this week again, and they’re not especially
time-consuming for us, or for you. We hope you like them. Answers to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk

Close-ups
Answers and stuff
Hopefully this picture quiz is pretty
much Google-proof.
We’ve taken some close-ups of
iconic album covers, and all you
have to do is tell us the artist and
the title. There’s a point for each.
To give you a clue, there’s one each
from the 60s, 70s, 80s and the 00s,
and four from the 90s.

The Mummy, not Cher!) and Kelly
