Wye Women’s 1st 39
Kings Women’s 1st 20
By Annie Latham and
Hetty Stearn
Again Wye displayed sheer
strength, speed and agility,
proving that size definitely
isn’t everything!
Despite an early start, the
captain eventually woke up
and realised that, while most
of the team was en route to
Kingston, winger Kipling had
been left in the car park in
Wye. Well done for noticing
Scummy! The team arrived
a massive two hours early for
the 11.30 kick-off.
Things seemed to go from
bad to worse when we real-
ised our worst fears had
come true; it was the return
of the Tank! Luckily small
things like unconsciousness,
and not so small things,
like Tank, were not going to
stand in the way of Wye mak-
ing a crashing start to the
game.
Wye hit Kings with a mul-
titude of tries in the first 15
minutes, with notable run-
ning (like a pony) from fly
half Gobby and outside centre
Bendy leaving the opposition
trailing in their wake.
We gave them a chance
after half time when a few
tries slipped through the
defence, but then Wye pow-
ered forward again after
we took to heart some apt
advice from the opposition’s
scrum half: “Forward, run
forward!”
In the latter part of the sec-
ond half, Wye again showed
superlative skill with some
good backs moves orches-
trated by Gobby and more
great running from the
wingers.
Special mentions go to
freshers Kayleigh and Becky
for awesome effort in their
debut game. These two will
be forces to be reckoned with
in the future.
Flanker Pikey was moved to
outside centre following some
injuries in the backs. She did
an excellent job, though it
took a few minutes before she
realised that the back line
doesn’t play in the scrum!
The scrum deserves a huge
mention for massive effort
and spectacular power in the
face of what was not an incon-
siderable weight difference.
Good work for achieving
what appeared to be impos-
sible and turning over several
scrums!
The forwards, especially
jumper Spaz, also deserve
praise for their ever-impres-
sive lineouts. Proper job!
Players of the match went
to Bendy for her massive hits
and great ball handling, and
to Death for her “deadly and
sinister tackling”.
The last special mention
goes to fresher Alice, who did
a truly terrible job as photog-
rapher and forgot she had
the camera. (This can only
be blamed on the enthral-
ling quality of the game!) She
is officially fired from this
capacity and next match
will be on the pitch. No
excuses about injury will be
accepted.
Next week we take on GKT
in the cup, and Wye will be out
to marmalize!
RUGBY
Another victory for outstanding Wye
By Morten Olesen
Tickets have finally gone
on sale across the South
Kensington and Charing
Cross campuses for the
upcoming Varsity Day.
Students as well as staff are
strongly encouraged to get
their tickets as soon as pos-
sible, as interest will reach
record heights this year.
The event will take place
on Wednesday 16 February at
the Imperial College sports
ground at Harlington with
the main evening rugby game
being played at the Richmond
Athletic Association Ground.
Named the JPR Williams
Cup after former Wales full
back and St Mary’s old boy
John Peter Rhys Williams, the
main evening rugby game, or
Varsity Match, has become a
great success since it started
two years ago. The last two
years have seen closely
contested matches, with
the Imperial Medicals beat-
ing the IC side. The match
between the two sides this
year may well become the
tightest match in the short
history of the Cup.
As reported in Felix last
term, the event has been
expanded this year to include
three men’s rugby matches,
two men’s football matches,
two men’s hockey matches, a
women’s seven-a-side rugby
match and a women’s hockey
match, making it an all-day
event. All matches apart from
the first XV rugby will take
place at Imperial’s sports
ground at Harlington, near
Heathrow, from lunchtime
onwards.
The timetable for kick-off/
push-back is as follows:
Rugby 2nds and 3rds: 2.15pm
Football 1sts and 2nds: 2pm
Hockey Game 1: 1pm
Hockey Game 2: 2.30pm
Hockey Game 3: 4pm
Rugby Women’s 7s: 3pm
The results of the Varsity
Day competitions will be
announced at a presentation
at Harlington by the Imperial
College Union President and
the Imperial Medicals Union
President before the crowd
are taken to Richmond for
the JPR Williams Varsity Cup
Match.
Three types of ticket are
available:
A £10 advance ticket gives
access to ALL games at
Harlington as well as the
game in Richmond. Included
is coach transport from Beit
Quad to Harlington, from
there to Richmond, and then

Kensington to finish the night
off at the Union in South
Kensington.
A £6 advance ticket for the
JPR Williams Cup Match
in Richmond. This ticket
includes ONLY gate entry.
Holders of this ticket will
have to make their own way
to Richmond Athletic Ground
A £7.50 ticket available on
the night, at the gate of the
Richmond Athletic Ground,
giving access to the JPR
Williams Cup Match. Note
this ticket includes no trans-
port either.

LSE Men’s 3rd 48
Imperial Men’s 4th 25
By David Kaye
Imperial’s newest sports
team ran out to face their
first university opposition last
Wednesday on the back of two
heavy losses against ‘adult’
teams.
Confidence was fairly high
as Imperial Thirds had won
against the same team by a
comfortable 40 points earlier
in the season. The team was
weakened by two key for-
wards being pulled up to the
Thirds and one more pulling
out to injury.
Despite being strengthened
by four brand new players
turning up on the day, the
Filthy Fourths still only had
13 players and were forced to
play uncontested scrums as
they had only one front row
player.
LSE were immediately
on the back foot as new boy
and later man of the match,
Jonathan Woodrow, carved
his way through the defence
for his first of two tries.
The opposition immediately
responded with a period of
pressure, scoring three quick
tries using their pacey backs.
Imperial countered with
another try, this time from
Terry Scarrott, turning on the
engine to motor past their
helpless defence. A classic
piece of wing play from a lad
who, prior to the game, had
never even held a rugby ball!
Despite the efforts of the
Imperial side and another
weaving run and try from Jon
Woodrow, LSE, a well-organ-
ised team who have played
together much longer, scored
a further two and converted
one.
After the interval, Imperial
endeavoured to re-address
the balance with several peri-
ods of sustained pressure.
Imperial had a play on the
LSE five metre line turned
over and kicked away, deny-
ing a much needed oppor-
tunity. LSE used this rapid
gain in possession by winning
the lineout and, after some
hard forward work, forcing
another try.
Set pieces were quite poor
for the whole game, with
Imperial only winning one
line-out; however, one smart
set play led to Imperial’s
fourth try.
At an Imperial scrum on
the LSE 22 metre line, a sud-
den change of tactics led
Chav Dave to swiftly pick up
the ball at number eight and
pop round the blind side to
make use of the vast space
that the unaware LSE had
left. The ball was then given
to number nine, Neil Harris,
who made a powerful run to
finish on his debut.
The final Imperial try was
scored by the other debutant-
David Hunter, who fought
through two tacklers with
sheer determination to touch-
down and complete the clean
sweep of tries for the fourth
team new boys.
Despite the loss, the game
strengthened the team unit
and the tries made by the
four new players provided
inspiration for Imperial stu-
dents interested in taking up
the sport. Anybody interested
should contact the club or
meet at the Union on Monday
at 6pm for training. Who
knows, maybe you could con-
tribute to the fourth team’s
first win?
