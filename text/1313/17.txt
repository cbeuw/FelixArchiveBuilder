CLUB REVIEW
Another Friday night, another SICK
line up at the End. Tonight, the
menu had a Brazilian twist – namely
an exclusive DJ Marky four hour
set. Marky’s epic sets have taken
on legendary status in his home city
of Sao Paolo, but this was to be the
UK’s first taste of an extended ses-
sion with the Brazilian deck-wizard.
Set times have become a bone
of contention in the drum & bass
scene of late, with Andy C and the
rest of the D’n’B premier league
requesting longer slots to showcase
their music. However, club promot-
ers remain reluctant, preferring to
opt for safety in numbers, ie pack-
ing all the big names on one line-
up to attract the maximum number
of paying customers. This evening,
Marky and friends had taken mat-
ters into their own hands.
Our touchdown was slightly later
than anticipated, and it was imme-
diately evident that it was going
to be a busy night. The guestlist
queue was bursting at its seams,
whilst the regular line had wrapped
itself around the full length of West
Central St. Once inside, drinks were
purchased and a quick scan towards
the DJ booth revealed a familiar
figure at the controls – the Marky
showcase was already in effect.
As we hit the floor, we were greet-
ed by the sublime sounds of MC
Conrad’s Golden Girl, a tune that is
deservedly causing a storm on the
scene at present. Soulful and heavy
in equal measure, this was to epito-
mize Marky’s four hour onslaught.
Dynamite MC was in full swing, run-
ning the show in his inimitable style.
Fresh from his recently released
solo album, the Reprazent front man
had raps to burn. Unfortunately we
had missed out on Giles Peterson’s
performance, but the reports were
healthy. Meanwhile, Marky was
coming seriously correct with his
tune selection. The longer set made
for a deep and diverse assortment
– early highlights included a slice of
Calibre’s beautiful Hypnotize, a dol-
lop of Die’s funked out Jitta Bug and
a very rare outing for Roni’s 1998
anthem Breakbeat Tera.
Even though his set was long fin-
ished, Giles P could evidently not
bear to tear himself away. Hanging
around to share jokes with Dynamite
and Marky whilst getting down with
the sounds, it was clear that the
night’s title ‘DJ Marky and friends’
was not just a cynical marketing
ploy. The nice atmosphere was not
restricted to the DJ booth, and the
tight laser displays illuminated
smiles and good feeling all around.
Away from the main room, Bugz
in the Attic were hosting the lounge
and their broken beats provided a
fitting respite from the high tem-
pos elsewhere. Recently crowned
‘Worldwide Winners of 2004’ on Giles
Peterson’s Radio 1 show, one might
have expected this room to have
packed out. In truth, however, it
seemed the majority of the masses
had come for the man from Brazil.
When Marky first burst onto the
DJ circuit in this country, it was his
wild scratching and cutting tech-
niques that really caught people’s
attention. Back in the main room, we
were given an excellent reminder of
what the fuss was about. Playing a
record composed of nothing but a
continuous tone, the Brazilian won-
der proceeded to chop it to shreds
on the cross-fader, using the pitch
control to match it to the tune play-
ing in the background. Dynamite
could do nothing but look on in awe
as the entire crowd erupted.
As the set rolled on, things were
getting progressively nasty tune-
wise. Needless to say, the heinous
sub-section of Logistics’ Together
bust up the place and left the audi-
ence pleading for the rewind. Marky
seemed to be relishing the extra
time, allowing him to build up a
structured performance through
the night.
Perhaps the success of this event
will sway promoters towards longer
set times on a regular basis. If not, it
might be time to start saving for that
plane ticket to Sao Paolo.
