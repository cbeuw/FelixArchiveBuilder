January. Cold weather, dark
evenings and coursework
deadlines. Consequently I’m
going to leave the serious
journalism for now and write
about some forthcoming
parties.
Recent events
After a slightly slow start to
the term for the Union, due
to a rather busy start to the
term in the library as course-
work deadlines approached,
things picked up again with
events including a bungee
run night in aid of the
Tsunami appeal, the custom-
ary rugby girls’ beach party
and a trip to Canterbury.
This Friday looks set to
be another busy one, with a
visiting rugby team coming
down for the weekend, and
next Tuesday will be a foam
party.
Chinese New Year
On 7 February, the Chinese
society will hold their big-
gest event of the year, with
Chinese food, music, dancing
and games in the dining hall
from 7pm until 11pm, with
the show starting at 8.15pm.
The other big cultur-
al event of the year is the
International Night, when
students from any country
will have the chance to per-
form to the Wye community.
Hunt ball
On Friday 18 February, the
Wye Beagles will hold their
annual ball. The Beagles are
not a College or Union club,
and this is not a Union event,
although many students usu-
ally attend.
The Union is not pro-hunt-
ing, or anti-hunting for that
matter. Whichever view the
Union took on issues such as
hunting, some of our mem-
bers would disagree, and
it wouldn’t be fair to make
some students feel that they
couldn’t support union events
or use the services and rep-
resentation that their union
offers because they disagreed
with its political views. So we
stay out of politics unless it’s
something student-related
like tuition fees.
Choir visit
That weekend, 19-20
February, Imperial College
Choir will be visiting Wye for
their annual ‘weekend away’,
a chance to escape from
London and concentrate on
rehearsing, with some time
for socialising on Saturday
night.
Any London-based stu-
dents who would like to come
should contact Choir social
secretary Katherine Sloyan;
any Wye-based student who
wishes to join the choir
for their rehearsals that
weekend, let me know (any
Silwoodians, contact one of
us and we’ll see what we can
do…). Any Wye-based stu-
dents who want to meet some
real live South Kensington
students on Saturday night,
look out for more details.
Old boys
The weekend of 11 March
will provide a chance for
continuing students to see
some old friends again, and
a chance for new students to
meet some former students
and hear some amazing (and
sometimes not-quite-believ-
able) stories about “the old
days”. It’s Wye’s famous ‘old
boys weekend’.
As a result, the Easter
Dinner and Ball have been
moved forward a week, to
Friday 4 March 2005. This has
the added advantage of the
Swanley Hall at Withersdane
being available for the ball,
so hopefully our guest DJ
can finally use his whole light
show.
So, it may be cold and dark
right now, but this term has
plenty to look forward to. Just
as soon as you’ve finished
that essay.

Silwood Park correspondent
There cannot be one person in
this country who has not been
made aware of the force of
nature since the international
events over our Christmas
period, and there can be none
who can say they were not
touched by the images and
stories that have been emerg-
ing in its aftermath. So it was
with a sense of purpose that
the community of Silwood
mobilised itself to contribute
to the global relief operation.
A combination of second
hand book sale and inter-
national food night raised a
combined total in excess of
£380 which has been given to
the UNICEF tsunami appeal,
a fantastic achievement to
those organising it bearing in
mind there are only around 80
students permanently living
on site.
For the international food
night, the global community
was well represented with
over eighteen nations contrib-
uting to the feast, from the
well known and always appre-
ciated Chinese, Indian and
Italian to the less commonly
found Iranian, Caribbean and
Luxemburgish (Petit Beurre,
if you were wondering). It was
a firm demonstration that
the community at Silwood
and the Imperial world as a
whole is a global metropo-
lis. The home countries were
well represented too – there
were contributions from all
four parts of the UK, with
traditional Scottish Bonnie
Prince Charlie Chicken and
Clapshot and Welsh Rarebit
(fancy cheese on toast to the
English).
All was consumed in the
social room, conveniently
next to the bar where the food
was washed down and spices
cooled by drinks from our new
first time father Dave the bar-
man (congratulations Dave
and Michelle). Huge congrat-
ulations have to be given to all
the chefs, in particular Bish,
Saskia, Roshan, Niki and
Rob. There are also plans to
release a book to accompany
the series, in true Channel
Four style, with money raised
from these sales also going to
the relief fund.
A once in seven hundred
years natural disaster such
as this one demands a monu-
mentaleffortbyall.Itisimpos-
sible to place blame or fault
for the devastation caused
by such a rare event, which
should instead be seen as a
chance for humanity to join in
a common cause, recognising
the fact that the countries hit
did not choose this outcome
and that international politics
should surely be put aside in
order to help them recover.
