An Irishman, a Scotsman and a Jamaican...
I am glad to say that in this coun-
try the vast majority of people are
happy to live in a multi-ethnic com-
munity. However, as always, there
is a minority of people who believe
that this is wrong somehow and
we should all be the same. In some
extreme cases, people believe we
should all look the same, talk the
same and think the same.
In the last couple of years there
has been a significant rise in sup-
port for far right political groups
such as the BNP and the National
Front. This is clearly very concern-
ing for the future of our country and
the survival of our multi-cultural
communities.
These groups, in some instances,
can target students in all sorts of
ways. For example, they may decide
to come on to campus and try to
recruit members or just to stir up
racial hatred.
Aside from this, you as a student
may experience racial abuse either
at College, outside College or at
work, and it is important to know
what you can do if this happens. It is
also good for you to know the types
of racial abuse that can affect you in
all walks of life.
Racial discrimination
In the UK, the main law dealing
with racial discrimination is the
Race Relations Act 1976, which
was recently amended by the Race
Relations (Amendment) Act 2000.
European Union law (which the
UK has also agreed to) includes a
Race Directive which makes dis-
crimination on grounds of racial or
ethnic origin unlawful in: employ-
ment, training, education, access
to social security and health care,
social advantages, access to goods
and services, and housing.
What is racism?
It’s not about white against black,
or black against white. It’s about
origins, roots, religion, and not being
accepted for who you are.
A racist is someone who picks
on someone or treats them badly
because they view them as different
and unequal. Often, racists focus on
people who are visibly different, for
example, black or Asian people.
Racism can also include preju-
dice against ethnic, cultural and
national differences. Irish travel-
lers, Romanian asylum seekers,
gypsies and eastern Europeans all
experience serious discrimination
and racism. They are white but may
dress in a distinct way, speak a dif-
ferent language or act differently in
a racist’s eyes.
Sometimes, people who don’t con-
sider themselves prejudiced will
make fun of someone’s accent or
birthplace. Although it is easy to
go along with a joke at someone
else’s expense, this can make them
feel hurt and isolated. If you have
to make someone feel small to get
a laugh, maybe you just aren’t that
funny...
At College or at work
If you feel that you may be being
racially abused or unfairly preju-
diced against at College or at work,
there are a couple of options you
can take.
Firstly, you can take it up with
someone in your department, and
then, if you feel that you are not being
listened to, it may be an idea to seek
further advice from the Information
& Advice Centre, who can advocate
for you in such disputes. We are
independent of the College so would
be able to deal with the situation in
a more impartial way. You can also
use the Centre if you feel the same
thing is happening to you at work.
Extreme prejudice
Racist attacks and violence are seri-
ous criminal offences and must be
reported to the police. The Crime
and Disorder Act 1998 created new
‘racially aggravated offences’, such
as harassment, assault, grievous
bodily harm, and criminal damag-
es, which carry significantly higher
penalties.
It is also a criminal offence under
the Public Order Act 1986 to use
threatening, abusive or insulting
language or behaviour in order to
stir up racial hatred. This includes
distributing racist leaflets. All sus-
pected criminal offences and any
racist incidents should be reported
to the police. The Information and
Advice Centre can also help you in
this situation and give you advice for
reporting extreme case of prejudice
to the police.
Don’t let your concern turn into
crisis. Make the Information and
Advice Centre your one stop shop
for all your welfare issues.

STUDENT ADVISER
Summer ball
Everyone wants a great College-
wide summer ball. We need to make
it appealing yet completely finan-
cially viable and accessible to as
many students as possible in terms
of location, ticketing issues, and of
course date.
Unfortunately, departmental exam
timings vary so greatly, from the
beginning of term right until the
end, so we’re aiming for a date as
close to the end of the summer term
as possible to avoid exams for as
many students as we can.
We are looking at various
options, such as holding the ball in
College as we did two years ago,
going for an external venue like last
year, or maybe combining it with
the Union’s end of term carnival.
Or maybe something completely
new...
So if you’re interested in the chal-
lenge and fancy getting involved
in making this year’s summer ball
a success, or you just have some
bright ideas and suggestions, get in
touch at dpfs@ic.ac.uk.
Club and society events at
the Union
We’re looking into new initiatives for
ents and want to work more closely
with clubs and societies. This initia-
tive is a collaboration between the
Union and its members that allows
you to get involved in organizing
ents nights.
Contact your club officers if you
have an idea for a collaborative
event and then get in touch with
me at dpfs@ic.ac.uk. We’re making
plans for the summer term now.

Mixed messages
Apologies for missing last week’s
column. The observant amongst
you will have noticed that Union
Council was a little lacking in its
clarity of messages over the annual
rent review. That meeting finished
at 11.30pm the night before the rent
review meeting (and Felix’s print
deadline). Sam Rorke, my Deputy
President (Education & Welfare),
and I spent much of the small hours
and late morning preparing for the
rent review meeting that afternoon
and I just didn’t get a chance to get
my column done.
Rent review
Firstly I think with hindsight Sam
and I could have tried to put the
issues to Council in a less confusing
way. We found ourselves having to
piece together what the consensus
of their opinion was. Confusingly
Council had, as reported by Felix,
voted for option B (rents should
vary according to ability to pay)
but then voted against the overall
option. We thought this was partly
due to a misunderstanding of the
similarity of options A and C (and
the correspondingly split vote).
We therefore decided that there
wasn’t enough strong support from
Council for us to ask College to
vary rents according to ability to
pay. We felt that a small majority of
Council wanted all students to pay
the going rate for their room and
be empowered to make their own
choice about what type of room they
want and hence how much they
are prepared to pay. Accordingly,
support for students who can’t afford
higher cost rooms should continue
to come out of hardship and relat-
ed funds, which should be better
promoted.
Where we felt there was a strong
steer from Council was on address-
ing the unfairness that, at present,
identical rooms in halls that have
been refurbished to a similar stand-
ard are sometimes charged at differ-
ent rates. We were able to address
this at the Rector’s Committee
on Student Residences and it was
agreed that there should be some
price harmonisation. Accordingly a
single, refurbished en suite single
room will cost the same in Beit as it
will do in Willis Jackson.
Freedom of speech
As sabbatical elections approach,
the issue of independence of the stu-
dent media will rear its head again.
It’s perhaps worth reiterating that
Felix is editorially independent.
Similarly, it’s worth re-iterating
that the Union has a duty, under
the 1986 Education Act, to “promote
freedom of speech within the law”.
Of course, there are limits to free
speech and there are laws against,
for example, incitement to racial
hatred.
Sabbatical elections
Do you look at things around College
and wonder why they aren’t done
better? Can you challenge com-
monly held views and assumptions?
Do you have the drive to work long
hours, with very little personal gain,
to try to improve life for your peers?
Does working upwards of 100 hours
a week at what amounts to less than
£2.60 an hour turn you on?
If so, why don’t you think about
standing for election as a Sabbatical
Officer of Imperial College Union?
Very few people will ever thank you.
Everything you do will always be
wrong for someone. But it’s char-
acter building and a real chance to
make a difference for your fellow
students (whether recognised or
not). Nominations close on Tuesday.

Krispy Kreme
I did promise I’d stop talking about
doughnuts. However, the Medical
School RAG are selling Krispy
Kreme doughnuts all week – pro-
ceeds to charity. Which is fantastic
because they really are the best
doughnuts in the world.
