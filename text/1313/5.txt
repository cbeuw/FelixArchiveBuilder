Obscene molecules: no. 237
This week, a molecule that doesn’t get up to
too much at all. Fucol to be precise. The L-form
(only D form pictured) is obtained from the
eggs of sea urchins.
Next, week we look at the properties of Fucitol.
Not just any molecule, but a molecule with
some serious attitude.

Handsupanyonewhobelieves
that women are physiologi-
cally different from men. Do
you believe that women are
dependent while men are
more independent; women
think with their hearts rather
than their heads? What about
the role of a woman? Is it nat-
ural for a woman to want to
marry and have children, to
want the protection of a part-
ner, while men yearn to make
their mark on the outside
world? And of course, do men
gain a higher status in life
due to their work being more
important than that done by a
woman? What do these sup-
posed differences mean for
women in science?
I should point out that I
personally do not believe that
you can so easily divide men
and women based solely upon
their sex and would fervently
argue with anyone who would
suggest that women are less
suited to science careers than
men. My intention is to make
you think about whether you
believe differences between
the sexes are playing a role in
the fate of women in science.
As a woman, I believe I am
equally capable as my male
co-workers and I must con-
fess that I have never been
aware of any form of sexism
holding me back from follow-
ing my chosen career. But
you need only look around the
offices of the academic staff
at Imperial College to realise
the difference in the numbers
of men and women in top sci-
ence positions.
Recent comments by
the President of Harvard
University, Lawrence
Summers, have opened up
a huge debate on the dif-
ferences between men and
women in science, and his
subsequent apologies have
done little to quell the anger.
According to Mr. Summers,
women have less “innate
ability” at science and maths
than men, and he believes
this is supported by research.
Among my co-workers, these
remarks caused much anger,
from both men and women,
and had it been our Rector
who had expressed this
opinion, it is possible that a
lynch mob would have been
dispatched rapidly from my
building.
Mr. Summers later admit-
ted he “was wrong to have
spoken in a way that has
resulted in an unintended
signal of discouragement to
talented girls and women.”
Whether or not he meant to
imply that men are better
than women at science, and
even if his comments were
misinterpreted, a man in his
position should know better
than to make any suggestion
concerning differences in
ability between the sexes.
Mr. Summers made anoth-
er point that has not been
pounced upon with such pas-
sion. He suggested that lack
of senior female academics
is partly due to child-mind-
ing duties and the difficulty
for many women to work
the 80 hour weeks required
for advancement. While this
comment may not bepopu-
lar among many who believe
they do not fit this stereo-
type, it is hard to deny that
there is not a bias towards
women being the ones who
give up their jobs to have chil-
dren. While there are always
exceptions, I am sure that
there are still many people
out there who believe that
working mums are somehow
letting their children down
and these women will often
feel a huge amount of guilt
at not being there for their
kids. The key years for pro-
fessional advancement tend
to be between 25 and 40, and
a large chunk of this period
can be missed if women
have to put their careers on
hold for the sake of their
families.
So is there sexism in sci-
ence? I cannot believe that
the difference in numbers of
men and women in top jobs
can be attributed in any way to
genetic differences between
the sexes. But perhaps there
are still old-fashioned atti-
tudes towards women and
environmental influences
that impact their advance-
ment in science careers. You
decide.

News
in brief
US plans ‘robot
troops’ for Iraq
The US military is planning
to deploy robots armed with
machine guns to wage war
against insurgents in Iraq this
spring. The 1m high robots,
based on a robot already used
by the military to disable
bombs, is equipped with cam-
eras and operated by remote
control. Officials say the robot
warrior is fast, accurate, and
unlike its human counter-
parts, does not require food,
clothing, training, motivation
or a pension.
UK sends data-
collecting ship to
Aceh epicentre
A British research ship will
survey the sea floor near the
epicentre of the earthquake
that triggered the Indian
Ocean tsunami to gather
data for an early warning sys-
tem, the British embassy in
Indonesia said. The vessel,
which is fitted with a multi-
beam sonar suite enabling
the mapping of the ocean
floor, can retrieve informa-
tion from waters up to 5000m
deep, making it the first ship
capable of such an assess-
ment to reach the region off
the west coast of Indonesia’s
Aceh province.
Amazing hominid
haul in Ethiopia
Fossil hunters working in
Ethiopia have unearthed
the remains of at least nine
primitive hominids that are
between 4.5 million and 4.3
million years old. The fossils,
uncovered in As Duma, are
mostly teeth and jaw frag-
ments, but also include parts
of hands and feet. All finds
belong to the Ardipithecus
ramidus species, which was
first described about a dec-
ade ago.
Ultra-orthodox
J-walking
A new study in Israel has
shown that Orthodox Jews
are three times more likely
than their secular neighbours
to be risk-taking pedestrians.
Rosenbloom and her col-
leagues watched more than
1000 pedestrians at two busy
junctions. An explanation
given is that the Orthodox are
more fanatical and therefore
less afraid of death.
