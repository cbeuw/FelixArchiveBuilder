Patching together key events in
the life of legendary musician Ray
Charles and peppered with standout
songs, this is a tear-jerking, toe-tap-
ping biopic that serves as testament
to the man’s passion and resilience.
Seven-year-old Ray (Foxx) loses
his sight two years after watch-
ing his little brother drown, but his
mother Aretha refuses to coddle
him. Through a somewhat ‘tough
love’ approach to parenting, she
forces her son to learn to stand on
his own two feet and becomes the
embodiment of strength throughout
his life.
The film carries on to tell us about
Ray’s rise to fame and how other
things in his life almost destroyed
what he loved the most – his music.
As an adult he is exploited by near-
ly everybody he meets, but nearly
everybody recognizes that he has
real talent. In spite of his blindness,
he seems to be able to function
almost as if he can see. He cleverly
gets around many problems of the
blind by using his hearing and his
memory. He insists that he be paid
only in one dollar bills to avoid the
danger of being short-changed. But
he gets along and eventually has
contracts; first with Atlantic Records
and then with ABC-Paramount.
Evidently his major handicap is not
his blindness, but a taste for women
and heroin.
Demons sprout from guilt about
his brother’s death, or at least that’s
the way Hackford draws it. Unsubtle
scenes include Ray knocking des-
perately on a bathroom door where
others are getting high, and sudden-
ly he’s wading ankle-deep in water.
Later, when going cold turkey, the
memory becomes a horrific halluci-
nation with water turning to blood.
It may be slightly clumsy but it’s
done so well. Stylistically this film
is amazing – there’s something very
old school about it, and some of the
scenes are beautifully shot. But the
major selling point here is Jamie
Foxx.
Ray Charles has some pretty
distinct mannerisms. Foxx takes
Charles’ manner, his personal-
ity, his flaws, his shrewdness, he
takes it all. You constantly forget
you are watching him; it is like they
actually managed to turn back the
clock to Charles’ youth. Foxx really
is magnetic. The insanely rich and
detailed production design doesn’t
hurt, either.
This film pulls no punches of van-
ity or reverence for the blues-gospel
king. It is gratifying to know that
Mr Charles himself screened the
film and enjoyed it greatly. He’s a
man whose god was music and who
filtered God’s music through his
morally ambiguous life and made
it something special, to which gen-
erations have connected. Music is
what Ray Charles is all about, and
the music that he made, the impact
that he made, despite all the obsta-
cles (self-imposed or not), stand the
test of time. Any pain he might have
felt or caused was what made that
music, and we have to take the good
with the bad to get anything so spe-
cial.
It’s a fantastic performance, and
the music selections they choose
to follow his rises and falls is a
great spread of his work. I don’t
mean to detract from any of the
other performances in the film –
the women who play his mother
(Sharon Warren) and his wife (Kerry
Washington) and his major mistress
(Regina King) are all singularly tal-
ented and deserve recognition.
It’s hard to go wrong with a film
that shows Southern discrimina-
tion, sex and drugs, and glues it
together with the soulful music of
Ray Charles. The film is at its best
showing the roots of the character.
But the music is fine and is what will
please audiences. This is an amaz-
ing and touching film – one in which
you can actually say the actor truly
made it great. Haj Alttahir

The extraordinary life story of Ray Charles
A hot piece of action?
Ladder 49 is the film industry’s
latest attempt to encapsulate the
bravery and heroism of American
firefighters post 9/11. The story fol-
lows the career of Baltimore fire-
fighter Jack Morrison (Phoenix)
seen through reflections of his life
as he lies trapped in a blazing twen-
ty storey building.
The film deserves credit for many
good points – Disney have certainly
made an excellent job of keeping it
focused on the human side of what
being in a firefighting team entails
rather than allowing themselves to
get carried away with clichéd, over-
the-top displays of heroics against
burning backdrops. Both Phoenix
and Travolta deliver powerful and
moving performances and the cast-
ing of Phoenix – not your stereotypi-
cally rugged ‘hero’ – adds depth
and realism to the role. Travolta
gives a flawless performance as the
firefighting team’s captain, and the
acting of the supporting cast cannot
be faulted either.
The movie progresses nicely as
we see Phoenix start off as a fresh-
faced young rookie. Both the plot
and the characters are given plenty
of time to develop, as you gradually
acquaint yourself with the members
of Ladder 49.
Another plus is the interesting
mix of emotions and genres expe-
rienced whilst watching the movie.
Some scenes detailing the sense of
camaraderie amongst the Ladder
49 team will have you laughing
out loud in your seat, whilst other
scenes will have the more sensitive
members of the audience reaching
for tissues.
There was something about this
film, however, that failed to leave
the mark of a true classic. Perhaps
it was the fact that, although some
scenes were charged with raw emo-
tion, they sometimes bordered on
becoming clichéd. More than that,
however, is the undeniable fact that
firefighting heroics are best suited
to the small screen and are really
not the material of Hollywood block-
busters. The scenario of a fire can
only lead to one logical conclusion
from a firefighter’s point of view
– saving the people inside the build-
ing and getting themselves out: a
simple premise that doesn’t leave
the audience guessing. The team
either make it or they don’t.
Given the difficulty of finding an
interesting plot set amongst acci-
dental fires, Disney has done a sur-
prisingly good job of coming up with
a storyline that is suitably plausible
and engaging. Not surprisingly, this
film grossed some $73m in the US
where it whetted the public’s appe-
tite for fire fighting heroics.
Overall, it is difficult to find too
much to fault in this movie. Some
scenes are memorable and some
soundbites will stay with you after
it has ended, but it also needs to be
said that you would not be missing
anything if you were to wait for the
DVD release. Marya Ziauddin
