Since the success of Spiderman in
2002, comic book characters have
been waiting in line for the chance
to leave their pages to seek out
finer things on the big screen, but
finally it’s a chick’s turn to kick ass!
Elektra is back, and this time she’s
going solo.
We last saw Elektra at the end
of Daredevil (2003) where she dies
in the arms of blind lawyer Matt
Murdock. Having lived a tragic life,
Elektra (Jennifer Garner) is resur-
rected by a martial arts master who
leads the side of good against the
evil forces of ‘The Hand’.
Haunted by her past and enraged
by the brutal murder of her mother,
not even her sensei’s strict training
and discipline can quench Elektra’s
raging thirst for vengeance. Given
the ability to see shadows of the
future, she is more powerful than
ever. She becomes an assassin for
she has no reason to live, only to
kill.
Her latest targets are in the form
of a 13 year old girl, Abby (Kirsten
Prout) and her father Mark (Goran
Visnjic). However, what she sees in
Abby reminds her of herself and the
two form a bond. Having not done
the job she was sent to do, Elektra
dedicates herself to protecting her
new friends from other trained kill-
ers, some of which possess evil
supernatural powers.
Garner does a brilliant job as the
beautiful yet deadly killer. She looks
the part and is a dedicated actress
who carries the film. Let’s face it,
there have been countless films
where children have grown up to
avenge the death of a loved one, but
for some reason (possibly the outfit)
Elektra stands out for me.
Strangely, I grew quite fond of
‘The Hand’ and their deadly array
of assassins, one of whom spread
disease and death through touch
whilst one of the others bore tat-
toos which came to life. Novel ideas
indeed. They worked well in the film.
Unfortunately, they were not utilised
enough in terms of screen time,
much to my disappointment.
Elektra is pleasing to the eye in
more ways than just one – not just
Garner, but the film as a whole. The
lush forest green settings in the
majority of the film are a refreshing
change from the cold rooftops of
New York City.
The action scenes are relatively
short and fewer in number than
expected. However, those that are
included are satisfying to watch and
well choreographed.
Although Elektra possesses these
positive things, I feel the movie
lacked flow since her shadowed past
kept disrupting the rest of the film
in the form of annoying flashbacks.
Necessary as they are, I see no
justification to include that many.
Another contributing factor to let-
ting the film down was the brief
yet confusing love story between
Elektra and Mark. I never really
caught on to the point or relevance.
I left the cinema in a sense of bewil-
derment, as I am sure you will too if
you watch this.
However, don’t think for a second
I’m discouraging you from going to
see it. On the contrary, go, and check
it out for yourself.
It’s a rare treat for the ladies to see
a female kick ass, and the lads will
love it since Garner looks amazing.
Just don’t expect non-stop action. I
recommend you don’t all go running
to the cinema in excitement. Just
walk. Stephen P Smith

One lass you don’t wanna mess with
A very long French film
Manech (Gaspard Ulliel) is not dead.
Manech is not dead, for if he was,
Mathilde (Audrey Tautou) would
know.
Based on the novel by Sebastien
Japrisot, director Jean-Pierre
Jeunet’s A Very Long Engagement
brings out a realistic portrait of war-
fare set at the close of World War I.
The movie starts off with five French
soldiers who are sentenced to death
due to self-mutilation and are con-
demned to march out into no man’s
land.
It’s 1920 and the war has ended.
For three years, Mathilde’s beloved
fiancé Manech has been missing.
She refuses to accept the fact that
Manech died in early 1917 and still
clings on to a thread of hope, with
the instinct that he is still alive. So
she begins an investigation, through
letters, tracking down official docu-
ments and putting ads in newspa-
pers. This starts her on a journey,
trying to find an answer to the mys-
tery of her lost love by digging up
pieces of information that may lead
to nothing more that a heartbreak.
The viewers are put through the
viciousness of the war, heroism of
ordinary men, enduring passion,
intuition and persistence of the
human heart. The first hour of the
movie leaves you with a little confu-
sion because of the many names of
those involved. Gradually though, a
picture begins to emerge.
Audrey Tatou continues to amaze
the viewers throughout the movie
with her sincerity and natural
screen presence. Her sadness is
sometimes heartbreaking. However,
this movie is not only romantic
but violent. You find yourself being
drawn into the war scenes with each
bomb blast, due to the vibrations of
the sound.
There are some very graphic
scenes which include the image of a
man covered with guts of a comrade
and spitting some of them out of his
mouth. Jeunet also adds, with per-
fect comic timing, the minor argu-
ments between the postman and
Mathilde’s uncle Sylvain.
ProductiondesignerAlineBonetto,
cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel
and costume designer Madeline
Fontaine effortlessly make every-
thing feel fully formed and complete-
ly realized, especially the two major
landscapes, the trench (wasteland
full of blood and mud) and the peace-
ful country farm (full of warmth and
comfort of home). The colours of the
images in the movie are manipu-
lated and are sometimes given an
earthy look. What Jeunet really suc-
ceeds is in his amazing visionary of
the bittersweet but picture perfect
realistic finale that couldn’t have
ended any better, with the voice-
over narration relating the onscreen
action flawlessly.
As beautiful, grand and entertain-
ing as A Very Long Engagement
was, it was unnecessarily long. The
movie could have been cut down
with some tales, which hardly had
anything to do with the mystery, left
unsaid.
