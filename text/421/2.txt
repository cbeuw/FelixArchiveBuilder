Disabled students: some
financial points
Being disabled can result
in various additional expenses
as a student. Here are some
ways to relieve the financial
burden:
Additional grant
A n extra grant of up to
£150 i s a v a i l a b l e from local
education authorities to any
student w h o , a s a result of
h i s / h e r d i s a b i l i t y incurs extra
c o s t s . T h e s e c o s t s must be
related to study, for example,
buying a typewriter or tape
recorder, or additional rent for
special college accommodation.
The grant cannot be claimed
in respect of diet o r c l o t h i n g .
Supplementary benefit
Thus usual proviso of
availability for work does
not apply to d i s a b l e d students
when claiming s o c i a l security.
However, if you are receiving a
grant, your income w i l l
probably be too high to claim
in term-time but y o u w i l l of
course be e l i g i b l e in vacations.
Attendance and Mobility
A l l o w a n c e s
Disabled . students are
entitled to a tax-free sum of
£9.60 per week if, in medical
opinion, they are in need of
part a continuous attendence.
A taxable allowance of £5
per week i s a v a i l a b l e for
those who are unable or
nearly unable to w a l k .
A further benefit known a s
the "non-contributory invalidity
p e n s i o n " (phew!) c a n be
claimed by those w h o are not
able to work but have not
sufficient insurance stamps to
receive invalidity or s i c k n e s s
benefits. Students are not
normally entitled to this, but
each c a s e i s decided
individually so there is no
harm in trying!
Useful organisations
Certain voluntary organis-
ations offer various s e r v i c e s
including reduced prices on
study-aid equipment e t c .
