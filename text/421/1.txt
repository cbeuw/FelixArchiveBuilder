AP REHASH
T H E R E C T O R h a s decided to
salvage the Alternative
Prospectus ( A P ) by asking
R i c k Parker ( I C U Academic
Affairs Officer) and P e t e r Mee
(College Registrar) to check
the existing edition and
produce a prospectus devoid
of factual, punctuation and
grammatical errors.
Should changes to copy be
necessary then the sections
concerned will have to be
reprinted. F E L I X editor and
next year's I C A c a d e m i c
Affairs Officer P a u l E k p e n g -
ong feels that due to the
nature of printing the whole
prospectus may well have to
be reprinted at a cost of over
£900.
The additional cost w i l l
be met by the C o l l e g e .
Originally it had b e e n '
hoped to send out the A P
with the C o l l e g e P r o s p e c t u s ,
thus saving postage c o s t s .
T h i s will now not be p o s s i b l e .
The new A P w i l l probably be
ready for distribution in J u l y
and postage costs are thus
likely to b e around £600.
So the A P , which initially
had a budge of £1,100 looks
set to cost anything up to
£2,500 a l l told. T h e full
costs of the A P , are being met
by the C o l l e g e .

T H E D E P A R T M E N T of
Education and Science(DES)
y e s t e r d a y a n n o u n c e d
increases in undergraduate
grants of about187.. T h e new
grant levels (with this year's
figures in brackets) are £ 9 5 5
( £ 8 1 0 ) for c o l l e g e based
students in London, £875
(£740) for c o l l e g e based
students outside London, and
£675 (£570) for s t u d e n t s
living at home. L a s t y e a r the
grant levels were raised by
22%.
Accompanying the grants
increases are changes i n
parental contributions and i n
the amounts of Supplementary
Benefit that students c a n
claim in the Christmas and
Easter vacations. From Sept-
ember onwards the starting
point for parental contributions
r i s e s from £2,200 ' R e s i d u a l
Income' to £2,700. A D E S
spokeswoman said that
parental contributions w i l l be
reduced throughout the s c a l e .
A s expected students w i l l
no longer be able to c l a i m
supplementary benefit i n the
short vacations.
Further details of the
award are not yet known.
Pessimism
F i r s t reactions to the
award have been tepid a n d
p e s s i m i s t i c : A n N U S spokesman
commented that 'the award
would do little to shore up
the ravages of inflation'. Over
half their members would not
benefit from the changes in
parental contribution. They
were a l s o disappointed that
discretionary awards remained
unaltered.
E x - I C U President Trevor
P h i l l i p s w a s more profound.
'An 18% increase is .definitely
inadequate and at first sight
students in London are going to
face the same problems arising
from an inadequate grant but
only more so.
'To a degree it demonstrates
the cynicism and bankruptcy of
Government policy on public
expenditure because, inspite
of universal agreement that
the grant level is- too low,
they (DES) appear to have
reduced it even further in
real terms.'
Comments from I C O f f i c i a l s
were a little more optimistic:
'My immediate reaction' said
ICU—President Peter T e a g u e ,
'is that it is a very good award.
18% is better than I expected,
but a great deal depends on
the details of the schemes for
next year which 1 have not
yet had time to acquaint myself
with.'
On a more centre vers ial note
he added, 7 would rather have
seen this extra money put
towards abolishing the parental
means test'. #
A more reserved attitude
came from the R e c t o r , S i r
B r i a n F l o w e r s . 7 don't think it
would be wise of me to comment
in detail until I have seen the
very long document which I
understand sets out the terms
of the new award.'
'1 believe there is some
amelioration of the threshold
above which the parental
contribution will be payable,
but on the other hand I think
there may be less opportunity
for claiming supplementary
benefits during at least the
short vacations.
'Nevertheless the increase
amounts to 18% which at first
sight is better than I had
expected.'
Hard times ahead
T H E U N I O N was told last
week that it i s to receive a
10% increase in i t s block
allocation from the Governing
Body. T h i s w i l l mean an
increase per capita of 5.3%.
The Union had originally
requested a 23% increase per
capita and w a s most d i s -
appointed at the small increase
it received.
However, the C o l l e g e
itself, i s only receiving a
4% rise in its grant although
supplements w i l l be given for
C o l l e g e salaries i n c r e a s e s .
The actual increase in the
Governing Body a l l o c a t i o n to
the Union w i l l be £7,892 but,
on the latest figures, over
half of this i s accounted for
in increased staff s a l a r i e s
(£2,367) and increased N U S
subscriptions (£1,680).
Increases in Sabbatical
Salaries and H a l l Rents
account for another £1,000
thus leaving a total increase
of £2,845 to cover increases
on a l l other expenditure. T h e
Union i s s t i l l seeking c l a r i f i -
cation o n , whether the grant
includes £1,300 for next year's
Alternative P r o s p e c t u s or
whether this w i l l again be
treated separately. If it i s
included, then £1,545 w i l l be
left for increases i n a l l other
Union expenditure.
The d e c i s i o n on the A P
w i l l determine whether c l u b s ,
societies and U n i o n Committees
receive a 2% or 4% increase o n
their allocations. With inflation
currently running at 18%, I C U
President, P e t e r Teague, s a y s
a curtailment of activity w i l l
necessarily result next year.
" R C C clubs w i l l almost
certainly have to cut their rate
of subsidy a n d A C C c l u b s
may have to restrict the number
of teams or fixtures for each
c l u b ' , he s a i d . Subsidization of
s o c i a l events such as Freshers
Dinners and Formal B a l l s w i l l
be drastically reduced.
Entertainments may also have
to be curtailed.
A l l i n a l l , the future looks
bleak for I C U n i o n i n the
next year.
