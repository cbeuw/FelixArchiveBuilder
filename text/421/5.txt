"The most
unfortunate team"
Recently two members of IC
C r o s s Country C l u b travelled
to Holland to take part in a
long distance relay race
through several countries'.
Here is a report from Rich
Harrington one of those
intrepid runners:
On Thursday 6th May at
some ridiculous hour that we
scarcely knew existed, ' A l t '
Garnett and myself, pretending
to be Internationals, and
valiantly forsaking the U L
athletics championships left
Brixton and crossed into
The intense heat produced
many sunstroke c a s u a l t i e s ,
including one of our team and
nearly one of our female super-
stars (she c o l l a p s e d just a s
she finished her leg, but w a s
immediately revived by a
posse of more-than-wi I ling
pseudo medics).
The last leg of 12.5km
followed a restart and our
runner came in 4th, to the
finish at the sports stadium of
Enschede University, to the
sound of a brass band and
motor c y c l e escort. Overall we
finished 8th in a time of 12
hours 34.43, and were presented
with a prize for 'the most
unfortunate team'.The race w a s
won by a Nijmegen team in a
time of 10.54.20.
The whole event was
brilliantly organised by the
hosts at Nijmegen (as were
the associated celebratory
a c t i v i t i e s ) . It created a unique
atmosphere throughout which
compelled us to promise our
return next year.
England to catch a train
to Dover. Here we joined a
motley bunch from Reading,
Surrey and (inevitably)
Brunei U n i v e r s i t i e s to take
part in the Batavieren road
relay in Hoi land.
The race c o n s i s t s of 24
legs of between 5 and 12.5km
(covering a total of about
120 miles) and begins at
midnight on the Friday/Saturday
from Nijmegen University
(which managed to produce 22
teams for the event!!) By the
third leg our team had a lead
of about a kilometer over the
2nd of the 62 entrants. By
03.00, the race had passed
fromHolland, intoWest Germany
over the Rhine and back into
Holland, and it was soon
after the border that C U number
1 occurred. One of our number
followed a member of the
Eindhoven team who failed
miserably in an attempt to
navigate by the stars and added
4 miles to h i s stint, dropping
us several places, to mention
but a few. C U ' s 2,3 and 4
involved our minibuses failing
to deposit runners for leg x in
time to take over from those
running leg x - 1 .
At 06.45, the first of 3
restarts took place. The times
for the teams so far were
recorded and the 10th leg
runners a l l set off together.
T h i s was my stage, and I
covered the 8.9km in a time
of 31.06 to come in 8th. In
the heat of the day, A l f ran
his leg of (a very long) 9km in
a time of 34.45 to finish 5th
fastest for the 17th stage.

Orienteering
Navigational problems
L A S T W E E K E N D a small
group from IC made the long
journey to North Yorkshire to
compete in the B r i t i s h
championships. The team left
Wandsworth early on Saturday
morning, confident of being
able to produce good runs in
the event on Sunday; however,
after experiencing great
difficulty in finding a route out
of North London to the M 1 , it
was decided that further training
in navigation was required. With
this in mind, the team left the
motorway at lunchtime in an
attempt to find a pub, selected
from a certain well-known
publication. T h i s time the
navigation w a s perfect, and the
team continued the journey in
high spirits.
In the afternoon, a training
event was held with the IC
team limiting their a c t i v i t i e s
to very slow and easy running
round one of the shorter
courses. A l l the team managed
to miss their chosen start
times, due to the fact that
their watches were adjusted to
B r i t i s h summer time, whereas
the event was being run at
some arbitary Yorkshire mean
time, approximately 7 minutes
in advance of real time. After
the event, A l a n Leakey
attended the B r i t i s h Orienteering
Federation A G M , leaving the
rest of the team at the campsite
to attempt to put up the tent;
without the a s s i s t a n c e of
tent pegs: we are s t i l l puzzled
as to why A l a n needed these
at the A G M .
Sunday's event, held in
Cropton Forest, near P i c k e r i n g ,
ran to a m o r e standard
Orienteering time (a few
minutes late compared with
B S T ) , and thus a l l the team
managed to arrive at the
start on time, after an energy-
sapping struggle with the
tent. The forest w a s fairly
hilly, and soft underfoot, with
large areas of brambles and
dense undergrowth making a
lot of the going quite tough.
A good network of roads and
rides simplified navigation on
the longer stages, but on these
stages there were a l w a y s
several possible routes to
choose between.
David Rosen had another
very good run to finish 4th,
4 minutes behind winner
Geoff P e c k , in a time of 90
mins 15 sees for the 12.8km
course. The four m a j o r
international selection races
of 1976 have now been
completed, and David h a s
finished in the first four places
in each of these, and he thus
has a good chance of being
included in the B r i t i s h team
of five for the World Champion-
ships in Aviemore in September.
A s the ' A ' c l a s s w a s
restricted to 60 competitors,
A l a n Leakey and R o b A l l i n s o n
competed in the B c l a s s , over
a 9.8km course: both had
good runs to finish 43rd and
50th in 9 2 . 1 3 and 95.29
respectively. Ian Isherwood, in
his first championship race,
ran the 7km C course in 86.45,
finishing about 50th: this w a s
a very good run after some
disappointing performances in
recent w e e k s . Of other U L
runners in the event, A l a s t a i r
Doyle w a s 27th in the A c l a s s
in 102 m i n s , a good performance
for him, and C l i v e R e i d 57th
in the B c l a s s in 97 mips 5 5 .
The team, by now highly
proficient in navigation,
managed to find another pub
on the way home in which to
celebrate their good runs. It
was here that Ian earned h i s
new nickname, 'the C u c o z a d e
k i d ' . Our thanks go to the
event organisers for a very
fine event, and to several
northern breweries for their
very fine refreshments.
Cricket
NELP overwhelmed
A L O N G T H E E a s t India Dock

the 1st XI to play the North
E a s t London, P o l y t e c h n i c last
Wednesday. IC skipper Tom
Ghosh won the toss and decided
to bat. In what w a s to be a
40 over match but after 31
became a 35 overs match,
supposedly because of poor
light. IC then accumulated 190
for 8, significant winnings
coming from Maurice Throbb
(59), Tom Ghosh (31) and N i c k
Morton (28).
N E L P never looked as if
they would score at the required
rate of over 5 runs an over s o
some players were given the
rare opportunity of bowling by
thegenerous C a p t a i n . E v e n t u a l l y
however N E L P were d i s m i s s e d
for 127 with two recognised
bowlers taking most of the

with 3 for 28.
