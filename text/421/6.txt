EXTERNAL ECLAIRS
AS Y O U P R O B A B L Y know by
now, trainee teachers all over
Britain are occupying their
colleges after the ball was set
roiling in Scotland a fortnight
ago. You may not realise why
rational and normally moderate
students are taking such
drastic action. They want to
draw the attention of the public
to the Government's cuts in
teacher training and in teaching
numbers, which mean that up to
80% of students leaving
colleges this summer will not
obtain jobs in teaching - or
probably in anything else.
It is not often that the
entire student movement is
united on one issue but this is
the case over Education Cuts.
E v e n the Federation of
Conservative students reject
the position of the Tory Party
on this matter, although some
of their membership privately
admit that they s e e no altern-
ative for the Government. It
seems s e n s e l e s s to discard
these teachers who are s o
badly needed in s c h o o l s . After
a l l , only a fraction of the
population enter Higher and
Further Education,but everyone
goes through E d u c a t i o n between
the ages of five and sixteen ,
and s o this i s where s c a r c e
resources should be c o n -
centrated.
The Government have of
course been surprised by the
falling of the birth rate and

Alternative Prospectus
T H E D E C I S I O N to re-edit a n d reprint the Alternative
Prospectus ( A P ) must, I suppose, be welcomed, particularly
since C o l l e g e are to foot the b i l l . Nevertheless it i s rather
presumptious of C o l l e g e to seek to edit a student publication
when they have continually refused to permit students to
edit their P r o s p e c t u s (barring the I C U n i o n section).
The C o l l e g e P r o s p e c t u s does have factual errors i n it,
and f a i l s to give prospective students a full picture of what
going to c o l l e g e e n t a i l s . B e s i d e s forgetting to mention that
most students find some, if not a l l , of their courses and
lecturers boring, the prospectus gives a f a l s e financial
outlook.
Students coming to I C this October have been told that
they 'can expect to pay, at current prices, about 25p for
breakfast, 30p for lunch and between 2Sp and 50p for an
evening meal'. N o mention c a n be found in the P r o s p e c t u s
of the quality of I C refectory food. Next y e a r ' s F r e s h e r s
certainly are i n for a shock.
The same Prospectus quotes tennly h a l l rents a s L i n s t e a d
(£80.25, Southside (£52.75) and B e i t N e w H o s t e l (£50.25).
Rents w i l l i n fact be £145.60, £105.60, £ 105.60 respectively.
T h e paltry d i s c l a i m e r 'The information given in this
Prospectus is that current to going, to press. May 1975, and
is subject to alteration' does nothing to nullify the C o l l e g e
whitewash.
A l l i n a l l C o l l e g e o f f i c i a l s and academics should not
throw stones at the first A P when they themselves live i n
a glass parapet.
Despite t h i s , one fact does stand out; the A P is a
needless waste of money. If the C o l l e g e were prepared to
tell prospective students the whole truth there would not
be a need for a student P r o s p e c t u s .
There are two p o s s i b l e ways out of the current hypo-
c i r t i c a l situation. F i r s t l y a joint C o l l e g e and U n i o n board
should edit the C o l l e g e P r o s p e c t u s with each party having
equal s a y . T h i s would remove the need for an A P .Secondly
the P r o s p e c t u s could be altered to include the" o f f i c i a l
C o l l e g e section and on solely student-edited A P s e c t i o n .
Both w a y s would save C o l l e g e money. Correspondence on
this subject i s welcomed. P a u l Ekpenyong
have opted to maintain the
status quo rather than to u s e
the resultant surplus of
teachers to reduce c l a s s
s i z e s throughout the system.
Last year, the number of
teachers in maintained s c h o o l s
increased by 16000. T h e
predicted intake for each of the
next five years i s only 8000 —
a decrease of 50%. In addition,
the increasing graduate
unemployment means that
teacher taining students have
to complete for jobs with a
greater number of graduates
from the U n i v e r s i t i e s .
A year ago, the D E S expected
to attain the teacher-pupil
ratios put forward by the ninth
report of the National Advisory
Council on the Training and
Supply of Teachers ( N A C T S T )
and the ten percent increase
put forward by the 1972 White
Paper, " A Framework for
E x p a n s i o n " . It now seems
doubtful whether even these
aims w i l l be reached — and
prospects of removing a l l
c l a s s e s in e x c e s s of thirty
seem even more remote.

ICPGG- a new breath
of life needed
D O E S IC need a postgraduate
groupe? T h e answer i s , I
believe, most emphatically,
' y e s ' . T h e form it should or
w i l l take is far from s e t t l e d .
The group has struggled
by this year, but for the
majority of this time it has
had no chairman, few active
members and even fewer
meetings. Credit should be
given to Richard Upton, who
has kept the very threads of
the group together. He originally
intended to be the treasurer
but found himself, by default,
wearing the hats of chairman,
secretary and treasurer.
On the s o c i a l s i d e , the
group has organised a s u c c e s s -
ful theatre trip just before
Easter and is at present
preparing for its summer
extravaganza. T h e latter w i l l
take the form of a magical
mystery tour on the Thames
with transport in the form of a
boat with d i s c o , bar and
food even. T h i s should happen
on a balmy summers evening
early in J u l y .
T h i s year has a l s o seen
the setting up of a working
party within the C o l l e g e to
consider the future direction
of P G education and the
position of and the. needs of
the P G s in the C o l l e g e . T h i s
working party has three P G
members and id due to report
soon.
Externally, a s w e l l , P G
"education has been under
c l o s e scrutiny from a l l s i d e s .
The Committee of V i c e -
Chancellors and P r i n c i p a l s ,
the S R C and the Parliamentary
Expenditure Committee have
all produced reports on
postgraduate education. The
implementation of the recom-
mendations of these reports i s
imminent and could c a u s e
many changes in the system
as we know it. Not a l l of these
recommendations are, I f e e l ,
in the best interests of students
or of education.
P G ' s must take an interest
and an active part in the
making of d e c i s i o n s concerning
their future and education. In
a c o l l e g e with such a large
P G sector a s IC h a s , it i s
amazing that over 1500
postgrads make s o little
impact and that their combined
voice i s s o pathetic.
Most postgrads at IC give
the impression of being here
to work and work only. We
are here to work but surely
there are other things to be
gained from o n e ' s time here.
The IC postgraduate group
must be put back on its feet.
You c a n make a start next
week by coming to the A G M
on Wednesday 2nd June at
1.00pm in E l e c Eng 408.
See Mr Upton, the one man
e x e c .
Hear reports on the P G
world for the past 12 months.
E l e c t some officers for the
next year. (Why not be one
yourself?)
Buy a ticket for the river
boat party.
A l l this and more.
I C P G G needs a new breath
of life. If you are an IC P G
come to the A G M and help us
to give you a postgraduate
group to satisfy your every
desire.
