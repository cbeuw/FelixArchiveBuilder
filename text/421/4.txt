KINKS - S C H O O L B O Y S IN D I S G R A C E ( R C A )
I D U N N O , it seems to me, that over the
last seven or eight y e a r s , the K i n k s have
lost out in one way or another. L e t s
face it, anyone mention the K i n k s and
people immediately think back to those
great singles of the s i x t i e s that flowed
from the pen of Ray D a v i e s . Y e t , they
have been largely ignored by the majority,
not gaining anywhere near the s u c c e s s
with their albums that they deserve. The
thing i s , D a v i e s has always written
good songs. 'Considering for instance the
K i n k s ' rock opera 'Arthur' was a far
better attempt at this abused fusion than
the acclaimed shambles that was Tommy,
there is no reason to believe that
'Schoolboys in Disgrace' w i l l achieve the
mass s a l e s it d e s e r v e s .
Throughout his songwriting, D a v i e s
has had a sort of tongue in cheek dig at
the Establishment, this album being no
exception. It takes the concept of a
young lad's trials and tribulations
through h i s school life. He quickly
becomes a s o c i a l misfit, later gets
himself into trouble with a naughty girl
and is finally expelled by the headmaster,
a l l of which leaves him feeling bitter
towards the Establishment for the rest of
his life. A bit c r a s s you might think, but
D a v i e s of course, treats the whole affair
with tongue firmly in cheek.
I could write about how melodic the
individual songs are, how they fit into
the concept perfectly, how clever the
lyrics are, but as a concept it should be
judged as a whole, and all I can say is
it works perfectly, ' another fine Ray
Davies effort that w i l l hopefully achieve
for the man the recognition he warrants.
For the fact remains that only perhaps
Ian Drury of the Kilburns has got any-
where near the D a v i e s sense of the
E n g l i s h melodrama, and he too may
sadly be overlooked by the media. These
two are truly English singwriters, - in
so much as one never finds them indulging
in any sort of Americana, like so many
of their British contemperaries who
attempt to A m e r i c a n i s e their songs and
end up achieving that strange mid-
atlantic feeling-wetness.

S U R P R I S E S I S T E R S (Good Earth)
WITH T H E s u c c e s s of the abysmal Rock
F o l l i e s television s e r i e s , there seems
to be a vogue toward a l l girl groups. The
Surprise Sisters were perhaps put
together s p e c i f i c a l l y with the ambition
of complimenting the accomplishment of
the Little L a d i e s . The result anyway i s a
polished, if slightly processed, sounding
debut album.
T h i s record is much better than that
which is high in the charts at present.
For a start the songs are better â€” but then
the songs on Rock F o l l i e s are atrocious
anyway and these girls actually can s i n g ,
something a l a s , that cannot be said of
the Little L a d i e s .
Ecstacy for all
Daevid A l l e n : Good Morning
F O L L O W I N G T H E demise of the planet
Gong, Daevid A l l e n , G i l l i S'myth and a
host of P H P ' s , octave doctors and other
gentle folk have taken refuge on the
Balleark Isle of Majorca. Whilst on this
sunny i s l e , they, together with a Spanish
band c a l l e d "Euterpe" carried on
producing the euphoric music that Gong
under their influence used to produce.
Side one is a c o l l e c t i o n of spacey
folk muses which seem to bear a distant
relationship to early K e v i n A y e r s
s t y l e s .
Side two has one track in the same
style as side one and then launches into
a time c a l l e d "Wise man in your heart"
with Mike Howlett on b a s s , Pierre
Moerlin on drums, Pepe Milan on glocken
speil and G i l l i with space whisper. The
style is that of " L o v e is what U w a n t "
from " A n g e T s E g g " . Is this track a fond
farewell to the much beloved planet?
T h i s is followed by a bloomdido type
sax entree into "She doesn't she...", a
happy melodic track relating how "The
real pot head pixie has learnt to speak
Spanish". Of course, this album w i l l
not only be enjoyable to filthy drug
addicts, perverts and schnizophrenics,
but you too could derive a state of ecstasy
from this beautiful pathway to Nirvanah.

The album starts with the best cut,
David Gates' 'Watch Out'. G i v e n an
intelligent P h i l l y sounding brass arrange-
ment, it gives a first impression that
the Sisters are in fact a white soul act,
but not really. It becomes apparent as
you listen to the record progress, .that
the sings become more diluted, until
you reach about halfway through the
second side when they become little
more than middle of the road pap,
resembling more a sort of bleached
Pointer S i s t e r s , they (the Surprises)
lacking the drive and range of the
American outfit.
I doubt very much if the album will
bring them any great s u c c e s s and indeed
the late seventies w i l l bring any form of
revival for all girl groups, like the fad
achieved twenty years ago, when the
likes of the Kaye Sisters, the Vernon
G i r l s , A l l i s o n s and the wonderful
Beverely Sisters adorned the hit parade.
Who could ever forget the Beverely
Sisters? Particularly the one who married
the great Wolves and England captain
B i l l y Wright (105 caps). Who then
together achieved further greatness
