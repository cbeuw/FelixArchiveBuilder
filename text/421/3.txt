Appalling complacency
Sir,— Having read concurrently,
both the pieces which have
appeared in the past two
editions of F E L I X on the
topics of academic work and'
social a c t i v i t i e s at this
C o l l e g e , I wish to air my own
v i e w s .
Stephen Humby's article
makes curious reading; he
seems to b e , indeed he states
quite explicitly;, that he is
d i s s a t i s f i e d with C o l l e g e life
at both the academic and s o c i a l
levels. He c l a i m s that answer,
ing the questions set on the
worksheets is a moronic
activity; a view with which
your other correspondent, C G
Miller, would seem to disagree,
saying that the way to conduct
one's work is to ' s o l v e the
problems a little at a time'.
Obviously Miller is satisfied
with the system, a complacency
which I find appalling. Where
Humby makes his error is in
confusing the system of work
with the subject being studied.
It is the latter topic where I
feel the discontent a r i s e s .
T H E R E IS N O T H I N G so good
for exam depression which
seems to spread like a flu
epidemic, than to hear about
a good old E n g l i s h wedding;
a wedding that brings tears to
mother's eyes; and masked
relief to father's. But not all
weddings run as smoothly as
that. Let me tell you about a
wedding which except for a
few minor calamities passed
off just as rehearsed!
Right on time, the vintage
R o l l s drew up outside the
church and my s i s t e r climbed
down supported by my father's
rather shaky right arm. E v e r y -
thing ran quite smoothly until
after the s e r v i c e , when I had
to sign the register. Of course,
there was one small problem;
the vicar only had a right-
hand pen so an entirely new
technique had to be employed
if the phenomenon of a left-
hander emerged.
We tried the left edge of
the pen; then the right to no
avail until with the nib
completely reversed, a spidery
scrawl slipped across the
page. Naturally this farcical
The contents of the various
subjects are at the moment in
this C o l l e g e , and in the
science faculties of other
c o l l e g e s , devoid of real
interest. There is no unity in
a subject, no relationship, or
else very little between courses
in the same subject, which
is bad. What is even worse
is that there is no connection
between the different subjects,
e s p e c i a l l y in the physical
s c i e n c e s , the situation being
slightly better in the biological
s c i e n c e s , though they could
learn from the physical
s c i e n c e s and v i c e v e r s a .
Although I have chosen the
example of s c i e n c e , I am sure
that, in the very nature of
things, similar remarks must
apply to a l l the subjects
studied at this C o l l e g e .
The method by which a
subject is studied, that is
worksheets, may or may not be
suitable; it really depends on
the individual student and
sweeping generalisations in
this respect are generally
situation took place in full
view of the congregation and
an audible filter was by now
rippling through friends and
relations.
The first embarrassing
situation past, I returned with
the best man to the front pew.
Praying posed another
problem. Seated on the pew, I
could not understand why the
kneelers were so far away
from the pews. Desperately
trying to recall school days
when I was reluctantly compel led
to kneel confined in a space
of nine square inches for the
purpose of praying, this
spacious area overwhelmed me.
Not satisfied with following
the example of the best man
and my sister who knelt with
some grace upon their knees,
I took two steps forward,
pulled out my kneeler and was
about to place it on the floor
when the best man exploded
in a stage whisper:
"What the hell do you
think your d o i n g ? " , which I
thought was most irreligious.
However, it did not end
there. Oh no, the fun had
unsafe; but the content of
what is studied certainly needs
to be overhauled.
Turning now to the s o c i a l
side of the life at this C o l l e g e ,
the position taken up by your
correspondents appears to be
the same: Humby d i s s a t i s f i e d ,
Miller s a t i s f i e d . In the latter
c a s e , if Miller enjoys himself
using present f a c i l i t i e s , he
has every right to continue to
do s o . Equally Humby has the
right to say 'I do not enjoy
the f a c i l i t i e s ' . However,
writing about not enjoying
them is not very constructive.
If he wants something different
he should get on and do
something about it, not
c r i t i s i s e others for enjoying
what he does not, an attitude
of "mind which I consider
churlish and smacking or
dictatorship and sour-grapes.

Spoof
articles
Sir, - In the past it has been
noted that articles have
appeared in F E L I X which
were pure inventions, of the
author's imagination. These
articles having no factual
b a s i s .
The first f i c t i c i o u s fancy,
only just begun. I suddenly
became aware of the insupport-
able weight of both my s i s t e r ' s
and my bouquet; so I gave
A n n e ' s to the best man who
placed it on his seat and
needless to say would have
sat on it if I had not laughed
at the appropriate moment and
snatched it from beneath him.
After a l l , crushed orchids
would not have looked very
pretty in the wedding photos
would they.
Suddenly it was a l l over.
I handed the bouquet back to
my sisTer, arranged her train
and was just thinking how
well we had a l l done when I
looked up to see the bride and
groom already 40 yards away
from Sara and I.
T h i s was really going too
far. She had warned me about
the danger of treading on her
train, but this was too much
of a dig. She was making her
lack of confidence in her
accident prone s i s t e r a l l too
apparent for a l l the world
to s e e .
Personally, I think for
someone who has made her
entrance to a party by walking
into, a (swimming) pool
fully-clothed and nearly
drowned taking a swimming
test, I did quite w e l l . I did
not fall into the font anyway,
which was quite on the c a r d s .
P a u l a M a r r i o t t
which appeared some time ago,
was taken to be quite humorous
However, the frequency of
fairy stories, appearing in
F E L I X , has become alarmingly
high.
Sometime ago a letter was
written showing concern about
the g o s s i p column ' T I T B I T S ' .
The article did stimulate
intrigue, but did not carry the
author's name. The column
was considered an excellent
innovation, but it was thought
personal opinions might be
expressed, that in a l l fairness
required the author the name
him or herself.
We wish to express two
opinions. One is that, although
most of the improbable (and in
retrospect humorous) literary
flights of fancy, so far
appearing, have been harmless,
there might one day appear an
article that could have uninten-
tionally serious consequences.
It is a l s o our opinion that the
credibility of F E L I X is at the
moment suffering, and w i l l
continue to do s o , from the
insertion of invented articles
in the paper.
We hope you respect our
v i e w s , and consider them with
the seriousness we feel they
deserve.
Yours Sincerely concerned,

(Your opinions regarding spoof
articles have been seriously
considered and I fully agree
with your reservations about
such articles appearing in
FELIX. However, all spoof
articles are carefully vetted to
ensure that they are not vin-
dictive, unpleasant, libellous
or boring.
They are an attempt to relieve
exam blues by taking a light-
hearted look at things. I
therefore hope that the
credibility of FELIX has not
suffered as a result of carrying
out one of its prime functions
which is to entertain people
while, of course, providing
them with news and information
