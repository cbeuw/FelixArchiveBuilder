RIDING
Preparations
Hello Riding Club members, this is
your co-ordjnator speaking.
It's now getting towards the end
of the year, and to that favourite
time when we must start to prepare
everything for next year. In this aim
it would be highly appreciated if
anyone who has hats would kindly
return them, or, if they are still
using them, then place a note in my
pigeonhole (Physics 2).
The elections for this year have
been held, but we are still in need
of a co-ordinator.
As for this year, there are still a
few events left including the end of
the year dinner (probably Friday
June 16) and a hack on Wednesday
June 14.
Remember we are still holding
lessons at Southborough
(Wednesday) and hacks in Hyde
Park can easily be organised.
Anyway best of luck with the
exams, and see you at the Tuesday
meetings.
