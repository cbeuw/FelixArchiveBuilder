• cR OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
AUT ready to
accept pay offer
University vice-chancellors and the
Association of University Teachers
(ALT) representatives have agreed
a possible settlement to their five
month o l d pay dispute which
threatens 70,000 degrees. It took
nearly seven hours on Tuesday to
reach a decision o n the n e w
proposals put forward by Sir Pat
Lowrv, independent negotiator and
chairman of the talks.
According to the new deal, all
academic staff will receive a six per
cent pay increase from April 1 and
a lump sum of £150. This may be
increased to £285 at the discretion
of the universities, equivalent tc
backdating the offer to January 1.
There will also be a merit award of
one per cent in October to reward
high performance and to attract
applications to short-staffed areas.
Despite reservations the A U T
have recommended this offer to
their members. Diana Warwick,
general secretary of the A U T , said
that this was not a fair deal but the
best they c o u l d d o i n t h e
circumstances.
There were varying opinions in
the A U T executive itself. Some
members wanted to hold out for the
original claim of six per cent from
March I, backdated to January 1.
The terms of the settlement are
being examined by the A U T council
meetings on Thursday, Friday and
Saturday and a ballot will be held
if it is felt necessary.
Dr Susan Parry, speaking on
behalf of the A U T at Imperial
College, said that they were less
than happy with the 'extremely
small' offer. She mentioned in
particular that some members
would be very unhappy that the
offer was not backdated to 1988. She
expressed concern about the
discretionary use of the one per cent
merit rises in October and said that
they would prefer it to be 'across the
board'.
Dr Parry said that the University
Grants Committee funding was
better at IC than at most other
universities and added that she
hoped the Rector, Professor Eric
Ash would offer a lump sum greater
than £150.
Professor A s h told FELIX that the
College would be as generous as it
possibly could, indicating that he
was limited by the amount of money
available. H e said that he would
prefer to act in accord with other
London colleges, which might limit
his offer further. He added that he
was looking forward to the end of
the action and hoped the A U T
would ratify the proposals at their
council meeting.
Tension over the dispute has been
rising recently. O n Monday the
lecturers' leaders won a High Court
injunction to prevent the sacking of
600 lecturers who had refused to
mark examination papers at the
University of Wales College at
Cardiff. The students at Cardiff are
supporting their lecturers, having
accused the college of doing nothing
to resolve the conflict. Lecturers at
Swansea had been warned that their
pay would be stopped if thev also
refused to mark papers.
Disaster
strikes!
The production of FELIX was
delayed this week due to the failure
of the Print Unit's offset litho
printing machine. The machine
broke down on Thursday morning,
two days after its regular service,
when a critical component sheared.
FELIX Editor, Bill Goodwin said that
he was unsure when the paper
would appear and described the
incident as 'bloody typical.'

No books for St Mary's
Academics at St Mary's Hospital
Medical School are angry at the
School's decision to convert one of
its libraries into a locker and work
room for BSc students.
Thev are worried that the closure
of the Wright Flemming Institute
library, which holds 1000 journals
on microbiology and immunology
will make it much more difficult for
academics to access the texts they
need.
Although the journals will be
rehoused in the School's main
library, an equivalent number of
journals will have to be put into the
library depository in E^ham because
of a shortage of space.
Head of the i m m u n o l o g y
Department, Professor Brent told
FELIX that the library's conversion
was 'of no benefit whatsoever' and
said that the removal of journals to
Egham would mean the loss of a
significant academic resource'.
The lack of space is so acute that
St Marys will be unable to bid for
medical books from the Senate
House collection when it becomes
an arts only library in 1990. There
are also fears that the intake of
periodicals — 500 of which have to
be discarded each vear to make
room new titles — will have to be cut
back.
'We've been given extra monev to
buv periodicals in new areas but we
are not sure where to put them' said
Senior Assistant Librarian Sammy
Smith.
The library's application to St
Mary's accommodation Committee
for 400 square feet of basement
space, sufficient to store 8000
journals in high density shelving,
was turned down in June last vear.
