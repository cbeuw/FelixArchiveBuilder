A Cry in the
Dark
This is a true story.
It's a story we all k n o w somthing
about, or think we do. A t the very
least, everybody has an opinion on
the death of Azaria Chamberlain.
Hands up those who think the
dingo did it.
The trouble is, much of what you
hear, and in this trial everything, is
filtered through the press. A n d that
means distored. So when Lindy
Chamberlain lost her daughter
during a camping trip to Ayers
Rock, the media began a witch hunt
that was rapidly supported by the
Australian public and much of the
world.
Before seeing this film I for one
had no idea that the accused had
been p r o v e d innocent a n d
exonerated, and I suspect there are
a great deal of people in a similar
frame of mind. But it seems rather
extravagant that Australia's biggest
ever film should be simply an
attempt to set the record straight
and highlight the miscarriage of
justice.
From the opening shots in Mount
Isa, the Chamberlains are shown as
a stable contente*d family. The dingo
is shown leaving the tent, and at no
time does the film ever suggest there
is any doubt about L i n d y ' s
innocence. The message is stated
clearly and firmly.
As the story moves from inquest,
to trial, to imprisonment, the movie
pulls no punches in showing the
immoralitv of the tabloids. Notably
the press are bored unless there is
an opportunity for further scandal-
mongering. This slant is acceptable
and necessary->-there are no holds
barred in the gutter press.
Throughout, Meryl Streep's lead
is both solid and believable, the
overburdened and unsupported
defendant being shown as a human
being. Husband Michael (Sam Neill)
shows strength then fragility, and
though easily outshone by his
Oscar-nominated counterpart, is
proficient nevertheless. Director
Fred Schepisi leaves a little more to
be desired, being somewhat erratic
and at times jerkey. The aerial
landscape shots are pleasant, and
used to good effect.
A Cry in the Dark is not an
entertaining movie, and Indiana
Jones III and the new Bond film have
no worries there. It could be classed
alongside other scapegoat films liks
The Accused or Scandal. Like those,
it is something you should go and
watch if you have an interest in the
events it portrays, not just so you
can see Meryl Streep giving birth.

CONTEMPORARY
DANCE
May Ball
Whereof we cannot speak we
should be silent, we were told by
L u d w i g Wittgenstein the father of
modern philosophy and part-time
hermetic eccentric. But I don't recall
any such dictat f o r b i d d i n g
movement in the face of such
spiritual/phsysiological twitchings
or for that matter any argument
precluding the making of music. It
is perhaps in instinctive appreciation
of this that contemporary dance
choreographers continue to discover
new ways in which the movements
of the human 'soul' (for want, as
ever, of a better word) can be
translated into movements of the
human form. Where language fails
dance w i l l often succeed,
outstripping the boldest aspirations
of the written word.
Examples of such success have
been as obvious and as welcome as
the 'greenhouse' spring that's been
baking the city for these past weeks
as London hosted some of the most
exciting new shows f r o m an
international line-up of company's
making their British tours.
The April in Paris season at The
Place launched Revolutionary Tactics
a programme of activities organised
to focus o n French dance
t h r o u g h o u t this bicentennial
anniversary of the French
R e v o l u t i o n . The ten dance
premieres from the best of the
French scene that were featured
included Le Ballet du Fargistan with
'Enigmas Miniatures and Other
Visions'. Featuring parts of limbs
and heads protruding through
mobile black frames and other
disorientating devices the effect was
hypnotic and compelling. Neither
was the 'funny-bone factor' lost on
the less self-conscious of the
audiences as, in spite of themselves,
they collapsed into titters at the sight
of a half of a head floating across the
stage or a naked man, haloed with
flowers, casually reclining. The
music was often equally as strange
featuring a range of sounds from
classic French springtime accordion
music to the explosive blast of the
didgeridoo (a fantastic instrument
that must be heard live) courtesy of
British composer David Coulter.
After two days at The Place the
company moved on to play two
more nights to open the May season
at the Waterman's Arts Centre in
Brentford but after stopping at
Cardiff and Glasgow have now
flown back over the channel,
proving that you need to be quick
off the mark to catch any single act
on the fast track of contemporary
dance.
As a good place to start then, if
you're eager to find the ideal
refresher from an excess of
Chekovian chunnerring here is a
brief guide to what's coming for the
rest of this month as the focus of
London dance shifts to Waterman's
Arts Centre—a venue constantly
buzzing with film, theatre, dance
and live music but still maintaining

with three exciting pieces including

a relaxed 'family' atmosphere that
will not admit of pretence.
