Rag Fete
Splat! FELIX staff get their
A revenge on Goodwin.
The vear started with the traditional
tiddlevwinking down Oxford Street,
which made £2,500 for Action A i d .
A week after that was the M e n C a p
collection which raised £730 (a jolly
good show by all who went).
After that came that bundle of fun
and jolly good japes, Rag Week
which started as usual with the RCS
Beer Festival, at which even though
slightly fewer people turned up than
last year, those who did managed
to drink more (we're obviously
getting the marketing right). Guilds
Carnival was a storming do with an
even more storming £600 being
made.
Aside from the balls-up with
IndSoc, Rag Week went reasonably
(and if anyone doesn't go through
the standard procedure w h e n
booking rooms during next Rag
Week they'll have their gonads
ripped off and mailed to their
grandmothers).
The onlv thing Rag Week was
missing was a big sponsored event
as the p i a n o m a r a t h o n was
consigned to its rightful grave. Next
vear a new, novel and excruciatingly
whaky sponsored event is being
developed. If you're completely
mad, an exhibitionist and don't
mind making a complete spectacle
of yourself please contact our exec
Gordon Honeycombe again,

through its Union pigeonhole. For
all those still with us next year, Rag
Week is the 8th to 18th of November
(so get your filofaxes out).
This year, the C C U ' s (namely
RCS) have done a lot of collecting
on their own initiative, leading to
the question of what exactly is the
definition of IC Rag, as we have a
set-up that is virtually unique in the
country. Rag Raids have varied in
success. Monopoly made £800 for
BIBIC, going into everything else
like casinos and bar quizes etc
would take too long. Ta to everyone
who helped with Rag Fete.
To summarise this year's Rag I
would say thanks to all who got
involved, no matter how small their
contribution, and so to next year....
