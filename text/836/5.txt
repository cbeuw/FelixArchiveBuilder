Opinion
The Best Class Of Degreed
I am moved to reply to Sydney Harbour-Bridge's articles in FELIX as they
have provoked sadness and disbelief amongst many friends and
colleagues. Those who know me well would agree that this move is an
uncharacteristic step for me to take. But a more representative view must
be voiced to redress the balance. Sydney's articles, titled 'ICâ€”A worse
class of degree?' argued the case that IC expects its students to work too
hard. He believes that the typical IC student has little time left to enjoy
a full social life once they have waded through the work expected of them.
The articles included colourful examples of his contemporaries who, after
leaving IC, found 'success' and 'happiness' at different universities or
in other walks of life. I would like to start my article by giving some case
histories of my own which show totally opposite experiences to Sydney
and his friends. I will also try to explain the reasons why Sydney believes
IC is such a terrible place.
Token sad story
Sydney's last article included the
sad story of 'Chris', an 'enthusiastic
and socially active character' who is
said to have been screwed up by the
l( system.
I have .i close friend who left
si hool at the same time as me; who
was a brilliant mathematician,
scoring A ' s and distinctions in the
two maths subjects he took at
school. He went to L'CL, a college
that has both arts and science
faculties a ratio of women to men
...depressed,..,drugs
higher than Imperial's and which
houses a higher proportion of
students in college accommodation
than Imperial. His course did not
push him too hard, but after a term,
he became depressed, got heavily
involved in drugs and eventually
dropped out without taking any
exams. H e never tried to re-enter
higher education again.
What does this story prove? It
proves absolutely nothing. It is a
true but colourful case of one
person's experience of university.
Just like Sydney's 'Chris', my friend
was not suited to higher education
but he was pushed along the path
which is the accepted norm for
bright students. Few people tried to
look at things from his point of
view. Many said he was needlessly
wasting his skills. He turned against
these people. However, some of us
did attempt to understand and
accept his attitude. We have
remained firm friends.
Success at Imperial?
For want of a worse example, I can
list my own experiences at Imperial
to counter the claim that IC students
must endure all work and no play.
In mv 3 ' : vears as an undergraduate
in the Mechanical Engineering
department, I haved managed to
remain an enthusiastic rower (a
sport that now takes up between 15
and 20 hours a week); I have been
sports editor of FELIX; treasurer of
a society; a regular at parties in the
Union; IC representative at our
profession's institution; taken part
and won a national business game;
led one expedition to Baltistan and
will be leading another this summer.
If the catalogue of successes reads
too much like a management
consultants C V then 1 should also
say that I have suffered failures too:
some bitterly personal; some
embarrassingly public. But the
supportive environment that I have
found at this college, and the
literally infinite variety of
opportunities available at IC have
helped me bounce back.
You don't need to be mega
intelligent to enjoy the opportunities
available here and still get through
the academic course. I managed
mediocre 2:2's in my first two vears,
\ ct 1 have recently been offered an
excellent job, even though I was up
against the most able Oxbridge
candidates. M v interviewers made
it clear how highly they valued a
degree from IC.
have tried to strike a balance
between work and play that
respects the academic needs of my
course but still allows me the
freedom to participate in what I
want, when I want. I was once
accused of being selfish because of
Embarrassingly public
failures
this attitude. Selfish is an emotive
word that implies unfairness to
others in the pursuit of your o w n
goals. I would prefer to describe my
attitude as opportunist: taking
opportunities as thev come, even
reating them, but never at the cost
of hurting someone else.
Does mv case disprove those that
Sydney used to discredit IC? N o ,
not as an isolated example. But I
know mv experiences are not
unique. Many friends and colleages
have thoroughly enjoyed their time
here at IC because they have struck
their own balances between work
and play. Once we are in steady
jobs, we won't be able to get
involved in so many wild and wacky
things. We may as well make the
most of those opportunities now
See both sides
Having read this far, you could be
forgiven for thinking that I believe
IC is perfect (or that I am being paid
to write this). I don't (and I'm not)
But 1 do refuse to adopt Sydney's
total negative attitude that if
something is wrong, everything
must be wrong. This negativity is
endemic in our tabloid society
where everything must be
expressed in black and white; where
no one attempts to understand
another's point of view. We are
becoming more and more polarised
by Dominic Strowbridge
How many of us are all to eager to
write a letter of complaint to the
Bank manager, or our Union
President? But how many would
write to sav thank you, or well
done' Fewer 1 would expect.
Our opposing opinions
Why should Sydney and I hold such
different views of life at 1C? I do not
know Sydney personally but can
identify two influences that may
give us these opposing opinions.
A major influence on Sydney
could be his experiences as ICU
President last year. The hostile role
that he chose to adopt was
understandable to defend himself
from the constant barrage of
bickering he had to endure in that
role. This must have taken its toll
and left some bitterness. I
personally will avoid confrontation
where ever possible: an attitude
usually mistaken as an easy way
out, whereas in practice it often
requires a high level oi tolerance and
understanding.
The other influence stems from
the different environments in which
we study. 1 have been fortunate
enough to take mv degree in a
department that has consistently
been judged outstanding in the last
few years. Sydney's department
was recently condemned by the
U G C as second rate. O u r
environments, at opposite ends of
a spectrum, will obviously give us
different attitudes towards our
lecturers and the work we do for
them.
There will be many other
influences on our points of view but
these may prove the most
significant. Do they prove that 1 am
M W and wacky
right or that Sydney is wrong? N o .
Sydney is not totally wrong in what
he says. He has simply put forward
his blinkered and unbalanced view,
without considering the issue in full.
His central argument against IC was
that our tutors expect us to work too
hard.
Lecturers at fault too
I believe Sydney has been led into
making this statement because both
he and the lecturers often fail to
appreciate each other's point of
view.
Most lecturers and academics are
people who dedicate their lives to
the pursuit of knowledge. Their
values are based upon respect for
learning and the acquisition of
knowledge. Most students at IC,
with the exception of the minority
who w i s h to progress to an
academic life, have a different value
system. They base their value
system upon a more industrial
culture, where status is associated
with progression up the managerial
ladder. Too many lecturers fail to
appreciate that their students are
not devoted to the pursuit of
excellence but are here, as a means
to an end, to gain a degree. A n d
many students fail to respect the
values of their tutors.
No philosophy
It would be arrogant to finish this
article with some g u i d i n g
philosophy on how to make the
most of IC. Everyone is different
and adapts to a situation in a
different way. What has proved
successful for me could prove
disastrous for another. What should
become clear, however, is that
whatever direction you choose, you
will only get out.of life as much as
vou put in.
There is a lot of work to do at IC,
especially now, with the exams
looming up. Good luck and I hope
you have a good time too!
