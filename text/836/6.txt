Depressed, worried about
exams or just a friend of
Sydney Harbour-Bridge?
Write in with your problem to
Marge, c/o the FELIX Office,
Beit Quad.
Dear Marge,
I got four A's at ' A ' level, excelled
in sports and other activities at
school and arrived at IC full of
enthusiasm. Over the past seven
months this enthusiasm has drained
awavâ€”I miss progressively more
lectures, I'm failing mv lab, I hardly
get any work handed in, and I'll fail
all my exams this year. I am sick of
my subject, I have had to give up all
sports and any other activities.
Nowadays, I just drink a lot, get
very depressed and 1 have become
involved in hard drugs.
Another friend of Sydney
Harbour-Bridge.
Dear Another,
We at FELIX have great sympathy
for your plight. Recent issues of
this paper have made more than
clear the disastrous effect of being
a friend of Sydney's. Yet, the
College authorities remain sadly
apathetic to this problem. All I can
suggest is to spend as little time as
possible with him.
Dear Marge,
Just a note to remind your readers
that next Tuesday marks the
celebration of the religious festival
'Brrdoodleodle' in which Yorkshire
Buddhists tie pork pies to their
elbows and dance around in a ring
singing 'Death to hedgehogs'.
Yet Another.
Dear Yet Another,
Sydney Harbour-Bridge screws
you up. Just say no!
Dear Marge,
Why do people think I'm mad?
First I was told a minority of one
was a madman, then they said
anyone who's a Christian and a
Tory is schizophrenic. But how can
a schizophrenic be a minority of
one?
What can I do?
The Prophet (Maths V
Marge says: Well, Dylan luvvy,
that's a very good question and I'm
afraid I'm in two minds about it.
And so am I, luvvy.
Dear Marge,
A reallv horrible bunch of people
tried to make me jump into some
mud on Saturday but I said 'No, no,
no, stuff your charities.' If you think
I'm taking my clothes off for that
kind of thing then you're mad. Call
me a spoil sport if you like.
Steph Sncll.
Dear Steph,
No insults, promise. Just keep
your clothes on. PLEASE.
Dear Marge,
For years, I have been trying to
lead a quiet retiring life out of the
public eye. However, a few weeks
ago, a Sunday Sport reporter settled
outside my front door and has been
pestering me continuously ever
since. This is a gross abuse of the
power of the media, and a breach
of my civil liberties. I am absolutely
disgusted!

A. Hitler (Mines)
Marge says: My advice to you
would be the same as that I gave to
Elvis of Civ Eng: Find yourself a
good lawyer, I always find Messrs.
Lennon, Holly and Lucan reliable,
and sue the b*st*rds to kingdom
come.
Dear Marge,
We have this irresistable urge to go
to the FELIX office o n Thursday
nights to help collate. So far, we
have all been able to resist this
impulse, but we feel ourselves
weakening. What should we do?
RCSU.
Marge says: Give in to all your
desires; it's not doing you any good
holding them back.
