increase in the last six years.

Is the Union trying to starve us?
Staff in the Union snackbar say they
are 'really embarrassed' at having to
serve reduced portions following a
clamp down on Wednesday.
The decision to reduce portion
size w a s taken by snackbar
manager, Ian Richards, in the wake
of large losses in recent months and
anv staff caught giving over large
portions will be forced to pay for
them themselves.
Mr Richards told FELIX that the
portions the snackbar had been
serving were larger than those
budgeted for when deciding the
snackbars pricing policy, which
provides an average markup of 60%
on food items.
According to the most recent
figures, the snackbar made a loss of
L949 in February and £2171 i n
December. This compares with a
profit of £1505 i n October.
Some of the losses are thought to
have been the result of thefts from

New FELIX Editor: Goodwin
and Baker to exchange jobs
The Minister of State for Education,
The Right Honourable Kenneth
Baker, a n d FELIX Editor Bill
Goodwin are to swap places for a
week starting next Monday in order
to highlight the difficulties in each
others' jobs.
'It's going to be fascinating', said
Kenneth Baker w h o plans to
produce a newspaper using his
talents in chemical engineering and
poetrv. He is hoping to bring to the
position his experience as an
artillery- instructor to the Libvan
Mr Baker said that he would
change the format of FELIX and
delegate sections of the paper to
editorially autonomous members of
staff. 'The Minister of Education's
workload is a bit amorphous, and
Bill will find it easy to do nothing for
,i week', he added.
Bill Goodwin said that he d i d not
expect to achieve much with only
one week in office. He hopes to use
the experience to prepare a report
on the workings of the Ministry.
Both expect to make several slip-
ups during the week and it will be
interesting to see the outcome.
College Secretary redefined
The job of the College Secretary will
be redefined after the retirement of
the current Secretary John Smith.
His Successor will be appointed to
the post of Managing Director
(Property and Finance).
The Rector, Eric Ash, commented
that the titile 'College Secretary was
archaic' and that the new title was
chosen to reflect the overall
managerial responsibility of the
post.
The Rector also said that there
would be no great changes as far as
the College was concerned, but that
the new post would concentrate on
estates and finance. The rector told
FELIX he felt the future of the
College depended on the correct
handling of assets such as Silwood
I'ark.
The appointment is being handled
through an agency rather than the
Personnel Department as the
College felt that the agency would
be better able at headhunting a
suitable candidate'. A special rate
lias been negotiated with the agency
through an alumnus of the College
who serves on the College Alumnus
Board.
John Smith is believed to be
unhappy at the manner in which his
successor is being recruited.

prank which had got out of h a n d '
and said that it had cost the College
a lot of money.

Murphy told FELIX that he would
be writing to residents of the hall
asking for information and calling
he culprits to come forward.
