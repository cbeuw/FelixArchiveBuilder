We've heard some foul rumours
that y o u got your name from a
Spanish crisp packet...
That's one of the lies, yes, certainly.
How long have you been together?
About eight months—we signed in
November.
Were you surprised at your sudden
success?
Af. first, yes, because we thought
'crummy little £120 demo...' it's very
surprising to see it competing with Jason
Donovan, but after a while we thought,
well, we are much better than fason
Donovan, so it's good that it's there, it
should go higher, although I don't think
it will.
H o w do you react to Bruno Brooks
playing your record regularly o n
Radio One?
Why not? Yes, it's good. I'll leave it
there. (Gives a stylised snorty laugh.)
Why did you sign to Food Records?
To be boring, because we felt they were
the best record company. They have all
the advantages of being an
independent—there's two people
running it, and we're the third band on
the label, and so we have all that
attention, but then we have the backing
of the mighty EMI, who handle all the
distribution and promo stuff, while the
artistic side is all worked out with Food.
So it's the*best of both worlds.
Did you get many other offers?
We didn't really hang around long
enough, because Food would take us out,
get us drunk and kiss us a lot—we felt
obliged really to sign with them.
You're labelled as a skate band. D o
you like that label?
Well, 1 don't like any label, but again,
that's one of the things people say about
us that I'm reasonably happy with. Two
of us are serious skaters, and the others
we're beating into submission.
Now that you've 'taken off are you
going to get much time for that sort
of thing?
/. At the moment it doesn 't seem like it.
No, I haven't had a skate for a while,
except for the sound check, I think we
all do our skating in sound checks now.
We'll see. ..I've got a couple ofdays next
week to go.
Do y o u think that your record
company will ask y o u to stop
skating?
No, I don't think they'll have the nerve
to say that to us. And we wouldn't stop
anyway.
What music do y o u listen to
yourself?
Loads of things. Anything, it's all
ammunition to me. The main things
tend to be hip-hop, stacks of that, loads
of house—any happening dance music
I'm interested in—and a lot of American
guitar bands: Sonic Youth, Pixies you
know. But if it's loud and raucous, 1 like
it. Plenty of things, weird and
wonderful.
You've had a lot of hype, good
reviews—when do you expect the
backlash to start?
J think it already has. Whenever you
have a lot of people walking around
shouting 'fesus Jones are the greatest
band ever' or even 'Jesus fones are
m i l d l y g o o d ' , there's always
someone around w h o notices and
will disagree, sometimes even on
principle, it doesn't really bother
me.
You wear almost stereotypical skate
clothes, is this a marketing ploy?
No, this is how we dressed before the
band started—in fact the way 1 met the
keyboard player was when 1 went to a
pub, and saw this person there with a
pair of Vision Streetwear shoes on. So
I looked at these shoes, looked in his face
and said 'Where do you skate?'...and
then we xvent skating and he joined the
band later on.
What were you doing before the
band?
The kei/board player has a degree in
Latin. The bass player had a very short-
lived college career—I think he did
horticulture. I definitely felt I wasn't
college or university material. I did 'A'
levels, but I loathed them, so 1 got out
as soon as 1 could.
Would you say this is 'your band'?
Well, to an extent, yes. I write all the
stuff, and it's generally my direction,
but I wouldn't pretend that I could do
it on my own. I do need the rest of them,
loathe them though 1 do.
How did you get the band together?
The guitarist was a music paper advert.
I think we had to take him because he
was the only one -who applied, -which is
a bit naff really—we're still trying to get
rid of him. The drummer I've known
since school, which is far too long. The
bass player was a friend ofa friend, and
you know the keyboard story.
Do the rest of the band refer to you
as Jesus?
Yes. No, actually, that's a complete lie.
But it sounds good. I think it's a good
idea, I shall make them do that. It'll be
good for me.
