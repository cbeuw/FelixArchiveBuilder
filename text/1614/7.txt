FILM
I
’m not sure whether seeing
too many movies has left me
bored of most of the emotions
they usually elicit, or if there’s
just something a bit wrong with me,
but when I plan to watch a film that
classes itself as a horror I’ve begun
to want to come out of the cinema
not just scared, but disturbed. I’ve
believed for a while now that the
true measure of a horror movie is not
whether it makes you jump, but if it
instead makes you stare emptily into
space for days after seeing it, start
bringing up matters of existential
despair in friendly conversation,and
lose hour after hour of sleep because
of fears of what’s lurking in your
cupboard. Sensory shocks like jump
scares are all very well for transient
adrenaline bursts, but a film that
says something truly horrifying
about the human condition delivers
a psychological shakedown that
sticks with you forever.
So when I saw the first trailer
for Guillermo del Toro’s latest film
Crimson Peak – all unfinished-
looking CGI, random audio silence
for suspense, and that classic cheap
scare of a loud bang-scream sound
quite a few too many times – I
became a bit nervous. Furthermore,
although his previous film, Pacific
Rim, displayed del Toro’s strong
sense of craftsmanship, it was
nonetheless bundles of simple and
thoroughly commercialised fun.
That heart-sinking trailer moment
was now about five months ago –
to have its release coincide with the
approaching Halloween season, del
Toro kept this new finished film
under wraps for quite some time
– and thinking back, it’s a relief to
know how much it differed from the
finished product. The wobbly CGI
is fixed and then some, and while
there are still somewhat irritating
jump scares here and there, Crimson
Peak is one of those rare horror
movies that is not just a horror
movie; it is much more.
EdithCushing(MiaWasikowska),
a young writer in late 19th
century
Buffalo, New York, is struggling
to kick-start her career; perhaps
because she lacks the talent, but
more likely because she is a woman.
Enter Sir Thomas Sharpe (Tom
Hiddleston), an English aristocrat
seeking financial help for a mining
invention from Edith’s father Carter
(Jim Beaver). At a party thrown by
Edith’s childhood friend Dr Alan
McMichael (Charlie Hunnam),
Edith meets Sharpe’s sister Lucille
(Jessica Chastain), a serious
woman with a chilling stillness
about her. Sharpe draws Edith’s
attention, and then her affection,
with his mysteriously charming air
(essentially his Tom Hiddleston-
ness), but also riles the suspicions
of Carter and McMichael. Carter
decides to take action, and the
resulting events lead to Edith
being whisked away to the Sharpe
family home Allerdale Hall, an
ancient, decaying mansion literally
being swallowed by the English
countryside surrounding it, with
crimson-coloured clay seeping
through the floorboards.
It is within this house that the true
action of the story begins: with this
change of setting the plot shifts from
an intriguing romance story to a
nebulous gothic mystery,punctuated
by bursts of startling, blood-soaked
imagery, and moments of shocking

the real root
of drama
and horror
Crimson Peak is an education in terror
An exploration of the nature of fear from gothic master Guillermo del Toro
violence that allow the movie to
remain unmistakably a horror. Del
Toro shows that he hasn’t lost a jot
of his production design skill that
made Pacific Rim so pleasing to the
eye. The film is simply gorgeous
from beginning to end; the
sweeping, Victorian-era backdrop
of crumbling Gothic architecture
juxtaposed with the clanking
machinery of mining equipment
make for the vivid atmosphere of
a twisted period drama with a hint
of steampunk. Each shot has a
path or position that feels perfectly
planned and – evidently polished
after the making of the trailer – the
CGI has an impressively physical,
tangible feel to it – the ghosts that
haunt the mansion have a look
that appears (typically of del Toro’s
work) simultaneously hypnotising
and horrifying.
What’s most impressive about the
film, however, is that the characters
and the drama itself take centre
stage, not the ghosts. Del Toro has
said of his approach to filmmaking
that he interprets “the good and
bad in our lives through monsters
and fables” that help him “grasp
who we are”. With this statement
and the film he shows that he
understands the real root of drama
and horror: it doesn’t lie in monsters
and ghosts, but in real people.
The actors all rise to the situation,
including a charming Charlie
Hunnam, an understatedly fiery
Mia Wasikowska, and an excellent
Tom Hiddleston. None, however,
deliver a better performance than
Jessica Chastain as the terrifying
Lucille – her character represents
the best things about psychological
horror, as she turns out to be in fact
the most terrifying monster in the
movie. It all builds to a nail-bitingly
gripping climax with surprising
amounts of genuine emotional
heft. It’s not a perfect movie –
there’s the occasional cheap jump
scare or off line of dialogue, and
it’s slow to start – but del Toro has
managed to recreate the melding
of stunning production design and
narrative depth that made films
like the fantastical Pan’s Labyrinth
so good, and has shown that when
the horror genre, although so often
done wrong, can be truly stunning
at its best.

T
here’s not too much I
remember vividly from
the first decade of my
life: trips to north-east
London’s Walthamstow Marshes,
the layout of my primary school
playground, and the occasional
awesome sleepover. But there
remains from those days an image
in my head of a bright yellow strip
of rubber that I’d pulled onto my
wrist, with a word engraved into it
that filled me with a kind of warmth
that I’d never really understood
at the time, but I recognise now
to be some form of pride. The
word was “Livestrong”, the name
of the cancer-based charity that
Lance Armstrong, big-time
cycling champion, philanthropist
and all-round incredible guy, had
established. I barely knew anything
about the exact scale of Armstrong’s
apparent achievement (which, as it
turns out, was massive), but to me,
he was quite simply a hero; I had
seen him on TV, he won stuff, and
he helped people, what else could
you possibly need to be one? But
what’s worrying today is that there’s
a good chance I would have thought
exactly the same thing had I not been
a child at the time of his reign over
the cycling world,because clearly he

fooled far too many people.
The subject matter of a false
idol turns out to be the best thing
about Stephen Frears’ new film The
Program – the idea of the world and
media championing people who are
not all they seem is a relevant one
at almost all times in this age, and
makes for an important story, one
that is told compellingly by the film.
There is a certainly a debate to be
had on the ethics of doping in sport
– should it be considered cheating if
everyone does it and you physically
Red Army
Dir: Gabe Polsky. Script: Gabe
Polsky. Starring: Slava Fetisov,
Vladislav Tretiak, Scotty Bowman,
Vladimir Pozner. 84 minutes.
I
n my experience, when
watching a documentary, it
helps to have at least a slight
interest in the subject. It’s a
lesson I learnt myself when I went
to see Asif Kapadia’s 2010 film
Senna, despite having nothing short
of complete antipathy towards the
entire industry of Formula One.
Needless to say I did not enjoy it.
And so the thought of sitting down
to see Red Army, a film that centres
around the sport of ice hockey – a
topic about which I know essentially
nothing – did not fill me with joy.
How I was mistaken.
Director Gabe Polsky, himself a
keen hockey player, takes the classic
approach of using a singular example
as a metaphor for something greater;
in this example, the Soviet Union
ice hockey team – who completely
dominated the field from 1954, the
year after Stalin’s death, up until the
dissolution of the USSR in 1991 ­
–
take the metaphorical weight of the
Cold War upon their broad, well-
built shoulders.Told largely through
the eyes of Russian legend Slava
Fetisov, Red Army is a story almost
too unbelievable to be true; with
the international reputation of the
USSR, and with it socialism itself,
based on how the players would
perform, the stakes were nerve-
rackingly high,elevating an already-
dramatic sport to Dostoyevskian
levels.
Of course, every story needs a
villain, and Red Army’s is provided
by Viktor Tikhonov, the ruthless
coach who – while driving the team
to victory – ruined any chance the
players had at a normal life; in one
memorable anecdote,a player recalls
that they were trained so hard that
members of the team began to
urinate blood.Through sketching in
Tikhonov as the arch-enemy, Red
Army gains dramatic clout, but this
is tempered by the niggling feeling
that the explanation is too simplistic:
sure, Tikhonov seemed heartless,
and probably was, but the wider
context of what factors in the USSR
would lead to such an appointment
are never really explored. After all,
not all evil actions are performed by
bad people, a statement reinforced
at the end of this film, when it is
revealed that Fetisov, held up as a
skating hero, was personally invited
to become Minister for Sport by
Vladimir Putin – a leader who
is perhaps the greatest threat to
European human rights.
But brevity is the soul of wit,
and omitting a thorough historical
analysis allows Polsky to focus
on the heroes of the story – the
Russian Five, the quintet who led
the team to victory time and time
again. Aided by snazzy graphics –
all Cyrillic lettering and socialist-
realist cartoons of overjoyed peasant
women – the film weaves together
nearly half a century of skating
history into a rich tapestry, one
that manages to combine high
drama with touches of humour.
Indeed, the film is threaded with
numerous moments of levity, from
an ex-KGB agent speaking to his
granddaughter to muddled Russian
idioms that clearly have no English
equivalent, a feature that lifts some
of the gravitas such a complex topic
can bring.
His first documentary feature,Red
Army marks an incredibly strong
debut from Polsky. While he has
a habit of making himself very
‘present’ in the film – including
the frequently-muddled questions
he asks his sitters, zooming out
to reveal parts of the recording
equipment,panning across someone
who is speaking; he’s certainly no
Frederick Wiseman – these don’t
interfere with the overall effect of
the film. Red Army may document
the position ice hockey held in
Soviet life – a fast, brutal sport in a
ruthless regime – but, like the team
itself, Polsky handles the material
with a lightness of touch, and true
finesse.
FRED FYLES
can’t win without it? – and The
Program deals well with both sides
of the issue.
It documents the rise of
Armstrong from not-so-humble
beginnings to seven-time winner
of the Tour de France, and his
fall from an honest, ambitious (if
obnoxious) cyclist to a sociopathic
megalomaniac. Ben Foster gives a
magnetic performance as the man
– his early earnestness is perhaps
the only reason that one could
sympathise with the character of
Armstrong for around the first third
of the movie, and as he becomes
increasingly entangled in the web
of his own deception, a venom seeps
into the performance so deep that
you can almost feel flecks flying off
his tongue onto your face.
But a good story and a great
lead performance, however, does
not a good film make, and The
Program’s flaws often lie in the
little details. Frears does a fine job
with individual scenes, camera
movements, and conversations,
but never fully delivers a sense of
the cinematic, and the film can
sometimes feel as if it were made for
TV – there’s no really breathtaking
moment or setpiece, whether in the
sporting or the human drama. The
script too is thoroughly uneven:
Chris O’Dowd does well as David
Walsh, the sports journalist on a
mission to expose Armstrong, when
he’s involved in actual dialogue,
but many of his lines and those
of the people he speaks to are
riddled with awkward exposition.
The only other cast member who
comes across well is Jesse Plemons
as Floyd Landis, the cyclist who
got caught doping and decided to
bring Armstrong down with him;
pretty much all other characters are
badly written, badly acted or both.
This is especially true in the case
of Guillaume Canet’s performance
as Armstrong’s manager Michele
Ferari – several times I found myself
thinking, “Did he really direct him
to say it like that?”
While there is also a problem

gives a
magnetic
performance
as Armstrong
with some of the editing choices
– headlines documenting his
wins and names of random new
characters flash onto the screen in
such silly pop-art style that it looks
like it was pieced together on an
old laptop – other pieces of editing
work well, such as cuts between
Armstrong’s motivational speeches
and scenes of the team injecting
syringe after syringe of dope. Scenes
like these remind you of just how
ridiculous the scam became – and
of why this movie is an important
one: it reminds us to question our
idols,and to not believe great stories
simply because they’re great. It’s just
a shame the execution of it makes it
sometimes feel a bit damp.
