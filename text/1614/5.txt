Imperial

O
n Wednesday, Imperial
was honoured to
welcome President Xi
Jinping of the People’s
Republic of China. The trip to
the College was part of a four
day visit to the UK, which was
the first state visit by a Chinese
leader in ten years. In addition to
visiting Imperial, the President also
met with Prime Minister, David
Cameron in an extremely important
meeting regarding the building of a
new power plant at Hinkley Point,
Somerset. Whilst in the UK he is
a guest of the Queen, residing at
Buckingham Palace.
Imperial and China have very
strong connections,which is why the
President and the Chinese Embassy
were so keen for the visit to happen.
In addition to the amazing Chinese
student population at Imperial,there
are also many Chinese researchers
working in the College, and
Imperial collaborates with Chinese
partners working on cutting edge
research. The key focus of the visit
was the announcement of a series
of new Imperial-China education
and research collaborations, which
will benefit both Chinese students
wanting to come to Imperial who
will now have access to more
scholarships, and the research
community in terms of funding for
Imperial PhD students to study in
China and research grants.
The President and the First
Lady, Madam Peng, were greeted
upon their arrival to the College
by His Royal Highness the Duke
of York, who then introduced
them to Imperial’s President Alice
Gast, Provost James Stirling,
and Chancellor of the Exchequer
George Osborne. They were also
presented with flowers by Union
President Lucinda Sandom-Allum,
and GSU President Luicheng Guo.
Alice Gast then welcomed the
President and the First Lady to
Imperial with a short speech,
highlighting strong links between
Imperial and China, and the
benefits to both parties. She hoped
Imperial could become “China’s
best academic partner in the West”.
It was
a huge
honour
to shake
hands
with the
President!
Following the speech, the
President and the rest of the
delegation were given a tour of
some of the research that really
highlights the College’s relationship
with China. Firstly, he visited the
Data Science Institute, which is
directed by Professor Yike Guo,
and the Hamlyn Institute, directed
by Professor Guang-Zhong Yang.
Both of these institutes will benefit
from a new £3 million grant by the
China UCF group to fund research.
On the tour he was presented with
examples of research from both
institutions, including a data-driven
analysis of the political and social
impact of China’s “One Belt, One
Road” policy, and technological
innovations in medical robotics that
have revolutionised healthcare.
Finally, President Xi met some
students of the College, and
exchanged a few words with
each of them. This gave him the
opportunity to ask what life was
like at Imperial, both in terms of
academics and activities outside
the classroom, including College
funded expeditions and heading the
Student Union.
It was a huge honour to shake
hands with the President!

A
ccording to the College
website, we are the UK’s
number one research
partner with China. In
a speech welcoming Xi Jinping,
Professor Alice Gast, president of
theuniversity,said“brilliantstudents
and academic collaborations are
making both the UK and China
stronger, more prosperous and ready
to deal with the challenges of this
century”. Surely these challenges of
the century should include opposing
inequality, imprisonment without
trial and the persecution of ethnic
minorities?
Google ‘Chinese President’ and
before long you’ll be greeted with
a whole host of human rights
abuses. Amnesty International has
said that the authorities “severely
restrict freedom of expression”, and
have criticised China for harassing,
detaining and torturing activists
and their families. For example,
since president Xi Jinping has come
to power, eleven women’s rights
activists have been imprisoned,
despite the president hosting the
UN World Conference on Women
just three weeks ago.
George Osborne, the Chancellor
of the Exchequer, accompanied the
president on his visit. He has been
praised by Chinese state media
for “not stressing human rights”
and focussing instead on business
potential. He’s said he wants the
UK to “stick together [with China]
and make a golden decade for both
our countries”. Although economic
growth in China has slowed, it
still accounts for about 25% of all
global growth, which is why he
wants China to be the UK’s second
biggest trading partner by 2020. As
China’s economy transitions, there
is an opportunity for British firms
to provide financial services which
the UK specialises in exporting.
The benefits for the country (and
university) in collaborating with
China are clear. It was announced
this week that more of the best
Chinese students will be given
state scholarships to study here, and
support will be given to Imperial’s
PhD students to study at Chinese
Universities. I am honoured to be
part of a diverse student body and
the idea of more people having
access to the world-class education
available here is something that
makes me feel proud.It is wonderful
that Imperial students will be given
the opportunity to study in China.
I just hope that this does not mean
we benefit from an alliance where
our partner is responsible for stifling
free speech and disrespecting its
citizens.
Imperial experts and their
Chinese partners are working
together on cutting-edge research
in fields including nanotechnology,
bioengineering, computing,
advanced materials, environmental
engineering and public health.
Research in these fields will
has already made a difference –
improving the quality of life for
people worldwide. Does turning a
blind eye to the state of affairs in the
country we are allied with mean we
that are inadvertently fuelling the
abuse suffered by so many? Can we
divorce ourselves from this state of
affairs and just focus on the science?
A girl can dream.
