hose of you who weren’t
drinking your sorrows
away during fresher’s
week at Tiger Tiger or
the RCSU pub crawl, may have
found yourself wandering into the
darker depths of Imperial’s social
facilities. Creeping into Metric on
the first Monday of term you would
have been pleasantly surprised.
Instead of the bass and sweat combo
usually found in the infamous
nightclub one would have found
a delightful and civilised stand up
comedy night entertaining freshers
and (brave) returning students.
Okay I was joking, it wasn’t
civilised at all. Comedy, guys!
The night kicked off with some
observational comedy from Carl
Donnelly, gently warming up the
audience with his natural story
telling ability. After the interval,
the audience returned to their seats
with apparent eagerness, maybe
because Imperial’s own comedian
and president of Imperial Comedy,
Arran Hobson-Sayers, was about to
take centre stage. Or maybe it was
because of the beer.
Arran welcomed the freshers in
true Imperial style by giving them
advice on the wild nights that they
would surely experience under the
Union’s rigorous social calendar.
However, Arran later warned about
the consequences of such drunken
adventures, stating “...it’s all good
until you wake up and Mary Berry
is in the bed beside you”.
If you ask me, that just makes it
better.Afterthethunderousapplause
died down,the next comedian made
his way to the stage. Andrew Watts
electrified the audience pouring out
emotional mid-life crisis stories. Of
course, being students, none of us
could relate. But what the hell, we
laughed anyway. Anticipation was
then rife for the arrival of Hasan
Al-Habib, perhaps Imperial’s most
famed comedian. He comically
described his long and arduous
journey, fighting against all odds to
escape Birmingham to the salvation
that is Imperial College London.
The headliner for the evening was
‘French’ comedian Marcel Lucont,
who decided to teach the students
in the room a thing or two about life
in the wider world. Dryly delivering
bawdy wit he reduced the audience
to boyish giggles (you know who
you are) as he made his way through
a collection of meticulous sex
poetry. And so, the first comedy
night of the year came to a close.
But it would not be too long before
another venue opened its doors to
the unique humour of Imperial
Comedy.

most as h-bar welcomed another
host of comedians this time to
entertain the postgraduates, who
we all know like to spend their
free moments listening to stand
up comedy and not working. Not
wasting any of the postgrads’
precious time, the first set was
delivered by comedian Matthew
Osborn, keeping his comic timing
on point. Up next was yours truly (I
won’t go into detail here).
Losing his stand up virginity
Akash Jyoti then took to the stage,
apprehension was present in the
room. Akash then unfurled a kooky
and eccentric performance bringing
unconventional energy to the bar.
The audience laughed throughout
a first performance worthy of note.
Following on from Imperial
Comedy was Shazia Mirza, who
dispatched brusque one-liners,
one after the other. Particularly
engaging the (few) female postgrads
in the room she whipped everyone
up into an outburst of laughter.
The last spot saw comedian and
sex symbol Earl Okin headline the
show. Hugely musically talented on
guitar, he erotically made his way
through an assortment of songs
with heavy sexual innuendoes
throughout. Probably the most
action anyone in the room would
get all year.
