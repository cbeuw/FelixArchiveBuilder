What is a “working royal” anyway?
Are the royal family still relevant in a democractic society?

T
he Duke of York was at
Imperial last week to
host the Pitch@Palace
Bootcamptofindfinalists
for Pitch@Palace4.0,an event where
bright young entrepreneurs get to
pitch to industry experts,CEOs and
people with lots and lots of money.
Since stepping down as the UK’s
special representative for trade and
investment in 2011 after concerns
about the company he keeps, Prince
Andrew has championed this kind
of start-up, supporting hackspacey
vibes around the country at various
university campuses and techspots.
In fact, previous finalists of the
Pitch@Palace series were Imperial’s
very own YOYO app.
While I am broadly supportive
of these kinds of schemes, it got
me thinking about the painfully
euphemistic sounding “working
royal” designation that gets used
regularly to describe members of
the royal family.
How many working royals are
there? Almost certainly more than
you think. For example, the Duke
of Kent and the Princess Alexandria
(34th
and 49th
in line to the throne,
as of May 2015) are considered
working royals and receive a 24
hour security detail from the
Metropolitan Police.
Since 2013, the royalty have
been removed from the Civil List
(of people kept by the State) and
instead get a single payment from
the Sovereign Support Grant,
which is around 15% of the financial
takings of the two Royal Duchies
(the Queen and Prince Charles)
plus other royal holdings, on which
no tax is paid.
Controversially, should the
financial situations of the Duchies
worsen, the amount paid per annum
through the Sovereign Support
Grant is protected and can only rise
over time.
While the introduction of the
Sovereign Support Grant has
removed the issue (to some extent)
of categorising which royals are
considered to be “working” and
therefore are on the Civil List, it
also appears to have allowed the
Keeper of the Privy Purse (in charge
of the financial management of the
royalty) to take part in some quite
shameless spin.
For example, the figure paid
through the Sovereign Support
Grant for 2015-2016 will be around
£40 million, which one could argue
is a relatively small price to pay
for the tourism money, soft power,
and warm fuzzy glow of patriotism
we all occasionally (yes, even me)
feel when we think of our long-
established monarchy. It allows very
positive comparisons to other states
with intact monarchies and even to
a handful of states with an elected
head (see Italy). However, this
figure pales in comparison to even a
conservative estimate of the full cost
of maintaining our monarchy.
For example, regardless of the
reform of the Civil List system,
many minor and even obscure
members of the royal family receive

police protection at the expense of
the London Metropolitan Police.
The budget (as obfuscated as it is, it
seems that revealing the cost of royal
security is in itself a security breach)
puts the most comprehensive
estimate of the cost of protection
for all royals who receive it has
been put at £100 million, a figure
that already dwarfs the Sovereign
Support Grant.
When all the ancient and
obscure, modern and hidden, and
otherwise generally unknown costs
of the royal family are added up,
the pressure group Republic (which
may be biased, but the report is very
well made) estimates the true cost
to the British Tax Payer (including
revenues from the treasury and
those that would otherwise be
collected by the treasury) as £334
million.
There was a popular figure of
£500 million said to be brought in
by the royal family through tourism
that was produced by VisitBritain.
This, if true, would more than allay
the financial arguments above.
However the reader might be
interested to note that this is simply
a quarter of the figure they judged
was due to “British Culture and
History attracting tourists”. I don’t
really want to start on why such an
estimate is flawed.
Added to this, the bizarre legal
entities that are the Duchies, with
their tax exemption and legal
privileges that would make any true
believer in a free market and/or
democracy wince, add to the feeling
that all might not be quite as good
value for money as the Privy Purse
makes it seem.
Many more issues spring to mind,
once the question is asked. Prince
Charles’ little spiders make it clear
he hasn’t the restraint of his mother
when it comes to the separation of
politics and the monarchy. Prince
Harry makes you wonder whether
the monarchy might always be such
well respected ambassadors around
the world for these blessed lands,
as unlikely it is that he’ll ever be
crowned.
Indeed I am not bothered that the
Queen has such political clout, but
I feel that if the head of state of my
country embarrasses, misrepresents
or stands opposed to my view of
the world (and a sufficiently sized
group of others’), as symbolic as the
royal family may be, they should be
deposable.
How long before the monarchy
stops being seen as a beautiful and
respected remainder of a bygone
age and starts being laughed at
anachronism in a world slowly
moving towards democracy? Kudos
to Prince Andrew for doing good
work, but I’d much rather you were
just an ordinary bloke.

Hating on Graduation is hard
The Angry Grad
Columnist
G
raduation day. Supposed
to be a milestone, right?
One of the happiest
days of your lives, some
people (morons) say. Well, not if I,
the Angry Grad, have anything to
do with it.
I was proper excited for it to be a
‘mare, and my God did the day start
off that way. I got stuck in traffic,
locked in toilets and stripped of my
gown (who the FUCK designed
them to attach by Velcro? I couldn’t
even swing my cape around like
Hazza P without some sort of
gown-related disaster).
I was all set to miss frolicking
across the stage, and that really
would have made a fantastic rant.
But, alas, I made it and was ready to
pinpoint and critique all the flaws of
G-DAY.
Whilst, yes, if we were in the
USA, I would major in moaning,
there’s no way I can fault the venue.
It pains me to praise, but it’s gotta
be said: it doesn’t get much better
than the Royal Albert Hall.
The grandiosity of the venue really
does drive home the fact that you
can now put those three little letters
after your name, and at the end of
the day, I did achieve something
pretty special and unique – just like
the other 800+ people I graduated
with.
The RAH, as British as it may
be, cannot balance out the guju
community of ICL. I salute you,
Shahs, Patels and Chowdrys, for
making my face crack a smile. Y’all
just kept appearing,like food at your
grandmother’s house, and my God
do I love you for it.
Moreover, instead of us Asians
sticking out like sore thumbs with
our names, which debatably were
invented on scrabble boards, the
Robinsons and Smiths amongst the
crowd were the ones that shocked
us.
We may have finished the
ceremony with God Save the
Queen, but that didn’t stop us from
playing Where’s Wally with the
white people before, during and
after.
WhileIdidmoanaboutsocialising
in my last column? Raving it up
with my homies at the reception
was pretty darn fun. I smashed
my fair share of champagne, had
one too many a photo shoot, and
generally just jammed like the baller
I am with my coursemates.
It was quite cathartic really, seeing
aswe’llprobablyneverallbetogether
again – they’ll be finding cures to
cancer across the globe while I still
can’t perfect rolling a round chapatti
– so we did just savour the moment.
I’m not sure how to describe it, as
it is an emotion I am unfamiliar
with, but I believe the common
folk call it ‘being content’. Even
my tutor pointed out that I came
across as overwhelmed, which made
an amusing change to my usually
underwhelmed state. For those of
you yet to graduate: you have a lot
to look forward to.
I’m gonna sign off – I’m heaving
and need a chunder because this
article is sickeningly sweet.I tried to
hate on graduation,but I couldn’t,so
now I hate myself.
Graduation only disappoints by being difficult to find its flaws
I didn’t fall
on stage
... and I did
indeed look
peng
P.S. WTF was that weird drum
bell thing on stage? Someone
enlighten me via the Editor please.
P.P.S. To those who read my
last column: I didn’t fall on stage
(unfortunately, no one did), and I
did indeed look peng. DOUBLE
WIN.
The modern-day hypocrite
Jennifer Eden
Writer
T
he inner hypocrite has
been lurking within
you for some time.
Occasionally it appears
in its most obvious form, whereby
said hypocrite exclaims, “I don’t
watch trash TV,” and then binge
watches 20 episodes of Keeping up
with the Kardashians. Of course,
“I only watched it to see what all
the fuss was about”. Sadly, not
fooling anyone. However, generally
speaking a hypocrite can take many
forms.
There’s the environmentalist who
recently saved a tree in Bolivia from
being chopped down. How did they
do that? They travelled 6000 miles
in a fuel guzzling jet; hacked away
a path in the rainforest to get to
the tree; then set up camp, only to
realize that the tent has flattened a
rare species of ant.
They proceed to piss off the
locals who need the land to grow
soya beans, which make the soya
milk that you consume because
it’s supposedly better for the
environment! But no matter, the
tree lives to see another day. That’s
until the environmentalist flies
home one week later (after let’s face
it,a bit of a jolly),and the locals stop
hiding the flame throwers.
The next species of hypocrite,
and one whose cause seems to have
been reignited recently, is the anti-
capitalist. The person who preaches
how much better the world would
be if it weren’t being strangled by big
bad businesses and our consumerist
ways. Of course, they vent their
frustrations on capitalism via their
Apple smartphone,on a profiteering
social media site, while sipping a
can of Coke, most probably wearing
clothing from Topshop or Primark.
Russell Brand is a glaring example:
with a net worth of £15 million
and a new book being launched
each week, need I say much more
about the hypocrisy of this socialist
champion. What’s scary is that his
followers/fans/minionsactuallysoak
up the mouth farts he’s churning
out, making a whole section of UK
society his good little hypocrites (or
revolutionaries, should I say).
There’s not enough time in the day
to list every common way in which
people say one thing and do another.
I think in many ways,we’re all guilty
of it. We form strong opinions on
crises we see on the news, yet when
it comes to acting on those views,
perhaps by giving money to a good
cause, many are reluctant.
Even something like celebrating
Christmas every year when not
believing in God could be seen as
hypocritical. Without trying to get
too deep, we’re all hypocrites each
and every day. The key is to not be
so obvious about it.
Stop showing everyone that
piece of bark you picked up in the
Bolivian rainforest (now a soya bean
plantation), and the photos of you
tickling a monkey’s armpit. And
please, please stop following that
curly haired moron because you
have nothing better to do than rant
about a system that, so far, is the
best we’ve bloody got.
