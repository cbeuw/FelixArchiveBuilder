L
ast weekend the quarter-
finals of the Rugby World
Cup took place, with the
Southern Hemisphere
teams winning all four matches.
The final game, between Scotland
and Australia, turned into one of
the most fascinating games of the
tournament, with a controversial
78th
minute penalty kick ultimately
proving the difference between the
two sides.
Take a look at the byline on
World Rugby’s website: “Building
character since 1886”. With that in
mind, I don’t know what “character”
the match official selection
committee is trying to build with its
statement on the controversial final
call in that game. For those of you
who haven’t read it, the statement
reads that “the appropriate decision,
therefore, should have been a scrum
to Australia for the original knock-
on” and not the penalty which
ultimately proved the difference
between the two sides. I cannot
help but feel that World Rugby has
thrown Craig Joubert under the bus
with this statement.
What is the point of this
statement? Is it for aspiring referees
to remember at some point in their
future? If so, their various regional
and national associations can pass
this down to them. Is this a pseudo-
apology to the Scottish players and
management? If so, speak to them
privately about the matter. The only
purpose I can see is to shift the blame
on to Craig Joubert for the decision.
If this is the route we are now
going down, I invite World Rugby
to provide us with an opinion on
every penalty given (and not given)
during a game.Perhaps at the end of
the tournament we would then have
a lovely table of could haves and
would haves. Yes the link between
this last minute penalty and the
final result is obviously clearer, but
in reality it counted no more or less
than any of the preceding points.
As will have been drilled into
every rugby player from the moment
they picked up the ball, the referee
is always right, even when they are
wrong. This is a part of the beauty
of this sport, seeing a 20 stone front

prepare to go again. The statement
released by World Rugby only
serves to undermine this approach.
Indeed, the entire basis of World
Rugby’s statement hinges upon
whetheryouconsiderthatAustralia’s
Nick Phipps “intentionally plays
the ball” according to Law 11.3(c).
Even with the benefit of the
multiple angles that we have had
access to, I am yet to be convinced
either way on this point. The
referee has to make this call in real
time, and as I was watching live I
immediately thought that it was
a penalty. There will be many who
argue that the referee should have
been able to refer to the Television
Match Official (TMO) on this call.
How many decisions are we going
to refer if this becomes the norm?
Is it any penalty decisions with 5
minutes left on the clock, with 10
minutes? Indeed, what about all the
penalties that aren’t given? In many
rucks there are moments where
some referees would call holding
on, while others would give a split
second longer. Should the TMO
be watching for all of these in the
last few minutes? It simply does not
produce a workable game if we go
down the route of assessing these
kinds of penalty decisions.
For any fans holding a grudge, the
wrong call was made at the lineout.
Execute your set piece correctly and
take the referee out of the equation.
The reality is that Scotland were one
successful lineout from a World Cup
Semi Final.Ultimately,for the game

Fixtures are subject to
change
to thrive we need referees. Being
hung out to dry on the biggest stage
by World Rugby is not the right
way to be treating those at the top
of their profession. Craig Joubert is
an excellent referee. The manner in
which he sprinted off the pitch at
the end of the game is unacceptable
and should be addressed, but I hope
that he continues to have a long and
successful career.
To those of you who feel that this
witch-hunt has been appropriate,
I implore you to go out, take a
refereeing course and take charge of
a few games yourself. After hearing
the comments from the Back-of-
Beyond 4th
XV fans, imagine how
amplified this would have been in
Twickenham on Sunday.
