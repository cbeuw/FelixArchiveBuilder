Fear the Human Resource Machine
C
apitalism has
manufactured its
own demise in the
inevitable future of
full automation. As machines
and artificial intelligence begin to
permeate every possible industry we
will soon see a workforce without
work; tomorrow’s corporation will
be a human-free dystopia. It will
be faster and more efficient, free
from the slow and unsteady hands
of man. Society seems blind to this
inescapable doom, and the one
solution that has been discussed, a
universal basic income, is likely to
face large opposition.
There is only one logical solution:
make man the machine. This is
the uncompromising vision that
Tomorrow Corporation presents.
We, as humans, must play an
essential role in the future of
automation by becoming fully
programmable and allowing
machines to dictate our lives, so
we can increase our efficiency
beyond all previous thresholds of
man. Compare this to a universal
basic income which – within the
context of a post-capitalist society
– gives all citizens an unconditional
sum of money. Without regular
work it’s easy to imagine the entire
population slowly devolving into a
demoralised mass of web-surfing
sloths. The creative types among
us would be complacent to believe
that they might be spared from
this potentially endless Netflix and
chill.
The alternative, combining the
mass factory work force of the past
with the precision and intelligence
of modern technology, could lead
at least lead to a society with some
illusion of value and purpose.
Luckily, there is actually a game
underneath Human Resource
Machine’s warped prediction of
the future, and it’s pretty great.
Having previously developed Little
Inferno, World of Goo and the less
well known, but still excellent dual-
screen puzzler, Henry Hatsworth,
Tomorrow Corporation are experts
when it comes to designing
innovative puzzle mechanics.
Whilst Little Inferno required the
player to repeatedly buy and burn
items to progress, their newest
puzzler tasks the player with
automating the actions of an office
worker in order to solve increasingly
complex problems.

the machine
increasingly found its way into
the mainstream with titles such as
TIS-100 and Spacechem, Human
Resource Machine presents you with
a number of simple commands
(with more added as the player
completes each puzzle) which
must be ordered to create basic
algorithms. A small worker, whose
appearance you choose at the
start of the game, proceeds to run
around the room following each
command in the player’s solution.
Two conveyor belts, IN and OUT,
represent the input and output of a
computer, and a small area of tiles
on the floor represent its memory.
The jump command is essential
in allowing players to create loops
of computation to be applied to
each input. Throughout forty or so
levels, the game provides a basic
introduction to assembly-like
programming. As a Computing
student, the majority of the game
provided little challenge, but there
were some puzzles later on in the
game that momentarily caused me
to question my degree choice. So
it’s easy to imagine that players with
little programming experience will
find the game frustratingly difficult.
There are a number of optional levels
(which are substantially harder) and
optimisation challenges, offering a
greater challenge to more capable
players. No matter what your skill
level, it’s incredibly satisfying to
watch as your worker speeds around
the screen upon correctly solving a
puzzle.
When it’s not warning us of our
impending doom, Human Resource
Machine is also a satirical take on
the modern workplace. Each level
represents a year in the life of your
with oversized heads contrast
the backdrops constructed
from distorted monochrome
photographs. It will be instantly
familiar to those who have played
any of Tomorrow Corporation’s
previous games, although this time

worker as you slowly climb the
corporate ladder or in this case,
elevator. By the game’s end (and
about 40 years of work) your worker
has visually aged with grey hair and
wrinkles,a comment on the millions
stuck in the same corporation for
their entire life. The level select
screen emulates the floor selection
panel of a lift with not so frequent
coffee breaks indicated between
large sets of levels. By revealing
more about the world in these
short and ambiguous cut-scenes,
the developers are able to capture
the painful crawl towards the next
moment of respite in the lives of
office workers.
All of this is presented in
warped cartoonish style; workers
they have gone for a slightly darker
palette - a mixture of dreary greys
and greens that perfectly match the
game’s bleak outlook. The music
from Kyle Gabler is surprisingly
upbeat, taking inspiration from the
modern electronica scene. Sonically,
it’s similar to his previous work on
World of Goo, easily one of 2008’s
most memorable soundtracks.
If for a moment you ignore
its deep and prophetic themes,
the enjoyment a player gets out
of Human Resource Machine
will ultimately depend on their
familiarity (or lack of) with
assembly programming. It’s as
unwelcoming to non-programmers
as the future is to those who aren’t
made from metal.
