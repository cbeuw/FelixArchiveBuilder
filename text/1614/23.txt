CANCER
VIRGO
This week as a School of
Medicine student enjoying
your free iPad, you learn
today that in the contract that
you signed for your free iPad
it says that you are no longer
allowed to complain about
anything at Imperial or on
your course. Did I mention
how I got a free iPad?

This week you realize that
the amazing mate you had in
first year who you always got
drunk with may not actually
be a reliable housemate.
Unfortunately you learn
this after he violently expels
waste from both ends in your
room after a night out.
This week you decide to try
milk for the first time. You
wake up disembowelled at
the bottom of the Mariana
Trench. Pint?
[This was sent to Hangman.
Hangman doesn’t understand
it.Maybe you do? If not,send
a better one to hangman@
imperial.ac.uk]
This week the usual guy is
writing the horoscopes so
the mediocrity that has been
forced upon you will now be
marginally improved upon.
You wouldn’t believe how
long these actually take to
write.Like at least a full hour.
Tough.
This week you discover
that although your biology
personal tutor has been very
chummy with you, she does
not appreciate you referring
to her as your ‘conservation
trap queen’ and you have to
attend a sensitivity training
session.
This week after making
friends with some medical
students you learn that they
have all received free iPads,
and when you get a chance
you have a look to see what
educational use they provide;
however all that’s on your
friend’s iPad is vibrator apps
and Angry Birds.
This week you discover that
your Horizons German
course is not all it’s cracked
up to be as it seems the only
other people that applied for
it were Chinese Engineering
students and the whole
lesson is spent learning how
to ask for different types of
screwdrivers.
This week you finally realize
that Imperial is not the
magical place you had built it
up to be and is in fact where
you will learn to resent the
course you do, scientists, your
teachers, your lecturers, even
the Library Café workers
who sell you your sweet,
sweet jacket potatoes.
This week whilst looking
for internships you stumble
across ADLT industries.
Being an electronic engineer,
you assume that you are
going to get some hands on
experience with advanced
lighting technology. You end
up being a mopper on a porn
set.
This week you discover that
if you have any particular
penchant for The Big Bang
Theory, literally all of your
friends will leave you and
never speak to you again,
rendering you socially lower
than that racist kid you met
in freshers’ week.
This week to celebrate the
Chinese President’s visit you
decide to occupy the Library.
You then decide to introduce
the death penalty and kill
2700 people, defying any
international laws or pressure,
and torture any political or
religious activists. Oh wait,
that’s actually China.
This week you discover that
making a reference to the
fact that the events of Back
to the Future 2 took place
on Wednesday is not an
interesting character trait
and if you really have to use
that in real conversation then
you should probably piss off.
HOROSCOPES
T
his week, Hangman
made the mistake of
looking at the Union
website, and accidentally
got dragged into the orange and
blue portal of hell that is the Big
Elections. As you’re no doubt
unaware, there were elections for
some majorly important Union
positions this week, including the
Ethics and Environment Officer.
We told you it was important.
Ethics are important, as is the
environment (provided you’re a
filthy hippie).
Unfortunately, Hangman didn’t
really feel any of the candidates were
truly up to our exacting standards,
so in the spirit of democracy we’re
completely ignoring the rules/
results and putting ourselves
forward for the job. Because shut
up, that’s why.
[Manifesto begins]
Hello, fellow human! Hangman
here. We’re running for the position
of [somebody check which position
this is] because we feel really
strongly about [whatever this
position is for]. Believe us when we
say you’ll definitely want to elect us
after reading this.
This is the part where we’d put
some sappy life story or rubbish
about our history and how what we
did that one time in Year 7 means
we were born for this job, but that
stuff requires effort to come up with
so you’ll just have to imagine it.
Maybe imagine something heart-
wrenching and movie-worthy. Like
the start of Up. Imagine that. Cry a
little. Keep reading.
In order to convince you to put a
‘1’ in the box next to Hangman and
then immediately forget who you
just voted for or why, we’d like to
offer you 3 policies that are entirely
legitimate and will definitely be
enacted if we get into power.
1) Free chocolate or some shit, we
don’t know.
2) Shut up.
3) We promise not to ever bother
you with this rubbish again.
Unlike that dirty socialist Jeremy
Corbyn, we have zero interest in
democracy, so you won’t have to
worry about electing anyone into
this job again. Wouldn’t that be a
load off your mind? No more silly
little elections?
[Manifesto ends]
If you have been affected by any of
the issues raised in this column (and
God help you if you have), then go
complain to someone else. Or email
Hangman and call us wankers.
Your call.
