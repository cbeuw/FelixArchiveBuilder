S
elf-care is a term that refers
to anything you choose to do
that is a step towards taking
care of your physical, mental
or emotional health. Practising
self-care is a key aspect to keeping
yourself productive, motivated and
happy while on a busy schedule
like the one typically present at uni.
Self-care can be as small as trying to
accept you needed more sleep when
you had that nap rather than being
annoyed at yourself for not keeping
on working, or as large as deciding
to set aside a few hours to make
yourself a blanket fort and watch
a movie in it. It can be easy to get
wrapped up in everything you need
to get done, and it is hard to notice
or accept when you really need a
break. When you are feeling run
down, let yourself take some time
out to look after yourself, because
you deserve it!
Writing down some “recipes”for
self-care can help a lot, and can also
serve as work-motivators because
you can give yourself a target and
then a self-care based reward
afterwards. To get you started, here
are some self-care “recipes” I like to
use, ranging from the simple to the
lovely-yet-elaborate.
Relaxing cinnamon and
nutmeg drink
1. Take your favourite mug and
fill the kettle.
2. Take a small teaspoon of
cinnamon powder and a
smaller teaspoon of nutmeg
powder/mace and put in mug,
with a generous squeeze of
honey.
3. Fill mug up to halfway with
boiled water and stir until the
honey, cinnamon and nutmeg
are mixed in.
4. Fill up the rest of the mug
with milk/milk substitute and
stir again.
5. Consume to your heart’s
content.
The blanket fortress
1. Make a blanket fort using
sofas, blankets, quilts, pillows
and so on.
2. Furnish blanket fort with soft
toys and fairy lights.
3. Make a hot beverage and
obtain some snacks e.g.
Self-care and looking after
number one
popcorn, chocolate bars,
almonds, crisps.
4. Find some comforting music,
a book or a movie you love.
5. If desired, grab a person to
cuddle along with your soft-
toys (OPTIONAL).
6. Cuddle up in blanket fort with
soft toys/person and watch
movie or read while drinking
your drink and eating your
snacks.
7. Continue until you feel
slightly less icky.
Movie time
1. Get some popcorn of choice
(can be any flavour or type)
and a cup of your favourite
beverage.
2. If you want to have a meal
too, then prepare it (e.g. you
could make yourself a hotdog
meal to be extravagant,or your
favourite pasta bolognaise
etc).
3. Pick your movie.
4. Turn off the lights and make
a comfortable place to sit to
watch the movie - if desired,
put on some fairy lights for an
atmospheric feel.
5. Watch the movie and snack
contentedly!
