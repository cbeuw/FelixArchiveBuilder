All hail the Frieze?
T
he dirty side of the
art world isn’t always
obvious, but Frieze
London is making
every effort to scream it in your
face. The fair ranges from the dull
to the exceptional – as you would
expect from any art fair – but the
commercial machine seems to
bleed through everything. Located
in a giant glorified marquee in
Regent’s Park, Frieze London in its
thirteenth year claims to offer an
unrivalled breadth and vision into
contemporary art. In many respects
it succeeds and given enough
patience, the Frieze is quite an
experience. Everything is on offer
and everyone will be impressed, but
the atmosphere is all wrong.
Arriving at the exclusive complex,
the word’s “Deutsche Bank: Main
Sponsor” are splattered left, right
and centre. The place is crawling
with security and I feel distinctly
judged for not wearing a suit or
some kind of felt smock.Apart from
the odd cluster of art students, the
crowd is made up of businessmen
and what I assume are art investors.
I’m not surprised since a standard
ticket is going for an extortionate
£35,rising to over £60 if you include
Frieze Masters. Who said the
art world isn’t accessible? Having
cycled over from an early morning
lecture, I’m quite keen on dropping
my bag in the cloakroom, but with
an impressively long queue and
charging £5 per item, I think I’ll
pass. I talk an exceptionally grumpy
security guard into letting me skip
the queue, but only press get that
lucky; the commoners can wait.
With over 160 exhibitors from
27 countries, I’m quite taken aback
by the scale of the Frieze. I try to
work my way through reasonably
methodically, trying not to miss
too much, but it’s not easy. I get
that they’re trying to put the whole
range on show, but everything feels

The commercial bomb is dropped on the latest and greatest in contemporary art
Cube. Their work is unsurprisingly
decadent and impressive, but on
the whole the display is rather
predictable. Walking around, I spot
everything from Anish Kapoor to
Francis Picabia – contemporary art
yes, but nothing new. A number of
live works are on display and the fair
has commissioned a series of Frieze
projects, but the masses of people
and the scale of the fair makes it
pretty hard to focus. I guess I’ll plan
better next year.

It feels so
heartless and
it seems to
go against so
much of what
art stands for
The real reason to come to Frieze
is for Focus – a selection of thirty
or so up-and-coming galleries
curated by the Frieze to show the
newest, edgiest work. Here the
names on the walls aren’t familiar,
but everyone knows the next few
stars are hanging here somewhere.
This is the dealer’s first destination
when they get to the fair and I’m
pretty sure everything is already
sold by the time I get there on day
three. Personal favourites include a
series of works by Harold Ancart
from the New York based gallery
CLEARING, but I’ll leave my
picks of the Frieze for the next page.
Admiring “Waterfall” by Chinese
artist Li Jinghu, a staff member
from exhibitor Leo Xu Projects
can’t help but try and sell me the
work.It’s irritating,but I still admire
the quality of what’s on show. The
reality is that this isn’t a gallery
but a commercial event. It’s super
interesting and I will definitely go
again (if I don’t have to pay £35 for
a ticket), but it’s a once a year event.
Turn over for my picks of the Frieze!
Frieze is
particularly
oppressive;
the art dealers
don’t help
a little cramped. Thinking of all
the great galleries in London, the
swarms of people at the Frieze make
everything a little claustrophobic.
You can enjoy yourself at the Tate
and it’s hard not to have a good
time at the Serpentine. Yes it gets
busy everywhere, but the Frieze is
particularly oppressive, and the art
dealers don’t help.
I walk past “Truck” by the
German artist Birgit Brenner and
overhear the exhibitor arguing with
a husband and wife over the price of
the work. €85,000 the dealer insists;
that’s the art world these days he
quips. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all
for art being valued and I don’t find
€85,000 so unreasonable, but there
is a brutality to witnessing such
ruthless negotiation in what should
be an enjoyable event. It feels so
heartless and it seems to go against
so much of what art stands for. Of
course I’m an idealist in that sense,
but I wish it didn’t have to be like
this – a few make their millions and
the rest can’t get by.
I’ve put quite a negative spin on
the Frieze and yes the elitist air is
rather unpleasant, but I’m here for
the art. The bulk of the fair is made
up of stands from a selection of well-
established galleries including the
likes of the Gagosian and the White
The hilarious world of Ahir Shah
T
he sharpest, most
politically charged
comedy I have ever seen
– period. Of course what
I’ve seen is somewhat limited, but
that changes little; Ahir Shah is
exceptional. There are many great
comedians who make you laugh,
and some who make you cry, but
few can make you think and feel
like Shah. Distant isn’t just another
set – everything is funny, but funny
with a purpose.
As a well-educated, British born
comedian Shah could play on his
Indian roots and build a clumsy
set on cultural stereotypes, but he
doesn’t force it. He has an amazing
appreciation for his place in society,
and he says so much more about his
heritage than many others would.
Shah knows he’s an idealist, but
he also knows the hypocrisy of his
western views.This isn’t just comedy,
this is a political lecture about
people like him and people like us.
With a lightning fast delivery and
material of mind-boggling detail,
Shah’s set insists on your full focus,
and it gets it.Jumping from smoking,
to ISIS, to the environment, Shah
covers immense ground, beautifully
weaving his words from one topic to
the other. You could just call him a

comedian,but calling him a preacher
might be more appropriate. This is
high praise, but it’s justified. Shah is
a poet with unparalleled vision, and
he achieves this at no cost to his side
splitting comedy. Many won’t get
his jokes, and for some it’ll be too
much to bear,but if you can stomach
it, Shah’s work is a must see.

Theatre... So go tonight!
This isn’t just
comedy, this
is a political

Imperial students enjoy Cumberbatch’s performance without leaving campus
Hamlet Panopto’d into the Union
E
veryone’shadthatmoment
when you wake up and
just cannot be bothered
to get up, get dressed
and make it to your 9am lecture.
So instead you decide to stream it
live from home via Panopto. When
Imperial Cinema decided to take
part in National Theatre Live and
stream Benedict Cumberbatch’s
Hamlet from the Barbican straight
into the Union Concert Hall, it
was all these students that thought
‘Score! I don’t have to travel across
central London to watch this, I can
just watch it from the union!’
First off it’s important to say
that Panopto wasn’t responsible for
the live stream of the show, which
see every heartbreaking emotion
expressed. This also meant however,
that when something happened on
stage and it was not in shot, the
cinemagoers became very confused,
wondering what the actual audience

were laughing at.
Aside from these minor
occurrences, the show was easy to
follow, with superb sound and visual
quality; the rumbling bass and
sharp lighting effects made it feel
like you were actually in the room.
The level of detail was astounding,
something you might not get sitting
at the back of a theatre, from the
intricate designs of the set to torn
up photographs indicating that
tragedy is imminent in this famous
Shakespearean play.
Cumberbatch’s performance as
Hamlet filled the air with an excited
buzz of an aggravated and disturbed
adolescent. What he excellently
displays to the audience is the
emotional torment of a son who
has lost his father, while trying to
wrap his head around an enduring
puzzle. What is also seen is the
emotional development of a would-
be king struggling to grow up in
very different world. Cumberbatch
succeeds in drawing the audience
in to sympathise with Hamlet, and
was apparent due to the ease of
transmission and lack of buffering.
National Theatre Live provided a
smooth and intimate experience
for the audience. It’s rare in theatre
to zoom in on actor’s faces and

edge of their seats.
