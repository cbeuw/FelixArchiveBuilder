How to cook meat
T
he next time you get the
family come to London
and take you out for a
meal, pause for a second
before you order the steak. I mean,
fine, it’s not your credit card, and it’s
typically the most expensive item on
the menu, so surely you’re getting
your money’s worth? You certainly
wouldn’t pay that much when you
go out on a cheeky date to Nando’s,
but that’s different; this is a time
to treat yourself. It’s not like you’re
missing out on anything else on
the menu – who really knows what
half of it is anyhow? Foams, airs,
deconstructions: all are meaningless
when you know exactly how juicy,
meaty and delicious that steak
will be. It’s a safe choice. But, ask
yourself - what am I really getting
that I can’t do myself?
Is it the meat? Well, maybe.
Kitchens have access to some better
quality meat than you might pick up
from many of the lower end shelves
(and sorry, but Tesco’s Finest doesn’t
really cut it), but lots of the meat
counters at many a supermarket
now stock some very good meat: dry
aged,well marbled,and cut properly.
And free range, higher welfare
chicken is now standard, along with
Welsh lamb and heritage pork.Fine,
it’s not the cheapest by far, but I’m
rooting for quality over quantity.
Is it the accompaniments?
Perhaps the lack of sauce Béarnaise
is what’s held you back last year, so
it’s only fair to treat yourself to that,
the triple cooked chips, and a token
rocket salad.
Or is it actually the skill – the fact
that you just get to sit there, idly
swirling your Chianti (just like at the
wine tasting your friend at Durham
took you to) and chatting about
the latest batch of freshers, whilst
pointedly avoiding all conversation
about your own degree, before a
steak appears, cooked just the way
you like it. Of course, that’s medium
rare; you have to show yourself off
as a real connoisseur in front of your
parents, so they see how well you’re
maturing at uni. Besides, it’s how he
orders it on Man vs Food, so it must
be the best way, right?
Let’s cut to the chase: you’re
ordering it because you hate cooking
expensive cuts of meat at home.
I used to. Spending £10 on a nice
steak, only to have a crisis moment
when it comes to actually cooking
the beast. But let’s break it down,
and dispel a few myths along the
way. This isn’t my own investigation
– far from it,it comes from the chefs
I’ve worked with, as well as some
of the excellent literature available
online that explores the world of
scientific cooking.
How do you take it?
For a start, what do we mean
when we say “medium rare” so
proudly to the waiter – as if they
insult you for assuming you might
have it any other way?! Well, as a
scientific institution, we should take
an objective stance – medium rare
is 57°C. Nothing to do with how
it feels compared to the palm of
your hand, or anything to do with
how long you cooked it for on one
side, or even if you brought it out
of the fridge an hour before cooking
– this is simple fact, temperature
determines doneness. So how do
you tell?
Well, spend £12 on Amazon, and
you can get a digital instant meat
thermometer. Basically a metal
probe with a thermocouple inside,
it takes a reading in seconds, and
you get to know exactly when your
meat is just so. 53°C for rare, 65°C
for medium (for beef at least. All
the other temperatures you can find
online). Life is so much easier now!
Is this thing on?
But how do you get to that lovely
temperature? Is it all about the white
hot coals in a disposable barbecue,
or maybe the lovingly passed down
cast iron pan from gran? Again, let’s
have a think.
Unless you’re dealing with very
cheap steaks, yours should be a nice,
thick cut piece of meat, and I’m
talking 1 inch at the very least! It’s
why meat counters tend to be better
for them: you can get them cut to
size. Cooking for one? Ask for a
thick piece from the scrag end, and
get a slightly narrower cut. Stay at
home date? Share a steak. You just
want a nice thick piece of meat in
your mouth at the end of the day. I
mean, who doesn’t?
But, with the laws of
thermodynamics (which, as a
Biochemistry student, I’m not
going to attempt to understand) in
mind, having a flaming hot grill is
the worst thing we can do. By the
time the heat has spread through
the steak, and you’ve taken your
careful temperature reading, the
outside will resemble the charcoal
you’re cooking over – well past the
golden brown caramelised sear we
want. So you switch to the pan, and
again, it’s just too hot! There will
be a nice grey band of overcooked
meat around the edge, with a tinge
of pink in the centre. Fine, you can
labour over it for hours with a lot of
butter, patience and constant (every
30 seconds) flipping, but that’s far
too much work for a busy student,
right?
Naturally, you can do all sorts of
things: leaving the meat out to get to
room temperature (which actually
takes well over 4 hrs, not exactly
speedy), only flipping it once (how
could that ever help even heating?)
and a myriad other supposed tricks
to get your meat to cook better,
very few of which have any sort of
scientific grounding, and even fewer
of which work.
Let’s get technical
So, let’s rewind: how to get
something to that perfect
temperature? Well,if I was to run an
experiment in the lab,I’d use a water
bath, which is exactly what many
modern chefs have turned to, in the
form of sous-vide cooking. But the
gadgetry is far too much money –

Reverse-searing is the the most impressive way to cook a steak on a student budget
It’s how he
orders it
on Man vs
Food, so
it must be
the best
way, right?
we’re looking to use the minimums
supplied in student halls.
Why not instead of using water,
using air as your cooking medium?
That’s how a regular oven works,and
so that’s the secret: cook your steaks,
and all your nice thick cuts of meat,
in the oven first. But not too hot –
you’re going to have the oven set at
the lowest it can go (most should
do about 100°C, but the lower you
can go the better), so that the meat
warms up slowly. It can take up to 2
hours for a particularly thick steak,
but in that time, you can be doing
anything. Just check it after half an
hour and watch as the temperature
rises. It couldn’t be simpler than
that!
Sear it up
Now that you’ve taken your
perfectly cooked steak out of the
oven, you could just dive in – but
it hasn’t got any of that beautiful
crust. That’s ok – fire up that grill
or heat a pan on the hob until it
smokes when oil is added, and
quickly brown the outside of the
steak, flipping regularly so you don’t
burn any spots. Or put it under the
hottest grill your oven can manage,
and watch it carefully. Now, that’s
how meat should be. You’ve just
completed your first reverse sear!
Named as such because unlike
normally, the sear came last.
The above also applies to chops
of all kinds, whole and jointed fowl,
and large roasts – slow, low heat to
bring up to temperature followed by
a brief trip to hell to crisp.Take your
pick of meat, and enjoy!
You don’t have to serve it on a slate, but it does help. Photo Credit: weeklygravy.com
