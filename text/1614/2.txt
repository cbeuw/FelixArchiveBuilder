ello, and welcome to
this, another issue of
your beloved FELIX.
I can’t quite believe
you’re reading my editorial when
there’s so much smashing content
this week. It’s very sweet of you.
Ooh I feel warm and fuzzy now.
You might’ve noticed, but we’ve
only had the ruddy president of
China in this week. He swung by
with Prince Andrew (again – he
can’t keep away) and heir to the
tory throne, George Osborne. Not
a great gang if you’re into human
rights or tax credits for the disabled.
We watched the Panorama episode
on President Xi, we asked Chinese
students what they thought and
we saw the crowds that gathered to
greet him and his A-list wife (who
in real life is a stone-cold fox by the
way; I accidentally bumped into her
coming out of RSM on the way to
college caf for a Muller corner).
Basically, he’s a really flaming
popular leader. He’s adorable, looks
like Winnie the Pooh and for fans
outside the business school on a
rainy Wednesday morning, this was
comparable to the Queen visiting,

rather than David Cameron.
Although I regreted not
shouting FREE TIBET or STOP
EXECUTING PEOPLE or
something at Peng Liyuan when I
bumped into her on Thursday, the
reality is that nothing negative is
getting reported by the Chinese
media anyway.
Should we, as a university, be
associating, even if on a business
level, with someone who condones
the kinds of civil rights abuses
we see in China? Yes, financial
contributions to research as a result
of President’s visit appeared even
before he did. And yes, this money
goes to super useful causes. We have
thousands of students who adore
this man and enjoyed his visit. For
those reasons, I think it was right
that he came here.
But when we have the world
stage with a President of a country
whose practices on something as
fundamental as human rights, we so
adamantly disagree with, should we
be showering them with gifts?
I’mnotsayingweshould’vethrown
red paint at the man, PETA-style,
but maybe a Corbyn-esque level of
polite discussion, rather than full
on celebration would’ve been more
appropriate. To be honest, if college
want to collaborate with Chinese
institutions and companies, for
academic and most likely financial
reasons, it has to court President Xi.
So I do kind of get it.
But I don’t know guys,maybe I was
just bitter ‘cause I wasn’t allowed to
shake his hand. That would’ve been
an awkward one to explain though.
‘What do you do?’‘I’m a member of
the free press.’ Oh dear.
