L
ast month the United
Nations adopted a new
manifesto to change
the world. Sounds
dramatic, but the Global Goals for
Sustainable Development are the
new benchmark to measure our
progress as a species for the next 15
years; and it turns out the scientific
community may be the key to
unlocking such high ambitions.

Women are needed to increase productivity
While some goals are explicitly
linked to research – climate change,
sustainable energy and clean water
– two targets could find less obvious
common ground in STEM circles.
Those being Goal 2: Zero Hunger
and Goal 5: Gender Equality.
Althoughtherelationshipbetween
STEM and feminism throughout
history has been complicated, to put
it kindly,new data shows that the pay
gap is narrowing, even if progress is
admittedly slow.The key problem is
now seen to be encouraging women
into STEM careers. It’s a common
R
eports dooming the
Earth as we know it are
not novel concepts. For
all the much needed
scaremongering in the media,
climate change as a threat sits on a
pedestal. It’s a threat that respects
no boundaries, operating across all
borders. However it’s only recently
that the financial repercussions of
such a crisis have started stepping
into the mainstream.
Companies and investors are
realising that any inconvenient
expenditures to reduce the effects
of climate change now will provide
financial benefits in the future.
Science and our economy should not
be considered as separate entities but
as two parts of a dynamic system.
This was stressed by Mark Carney,
governor for the Bank of England,
at the Lloyds leading insurers
gathering earlier this year.
Carney emphasised how a
potential economic crash poses
a huge threat as insurers invest
heavily in fossil fuel assets, likely
to be rendered worthless under the
effects of climate change.A fourfold
increase in losses related to extreme
weather events in the last thirty
years has already been recorded.
At present it is considered too
expensive for companies using oil,
coal and gas to invest in alternative
energy sources. Infrastructure to
extract fossil fuels is already there,
the investment has already been
made.It is a huge risk for companies
to disregard these current assets
when the future of renewable
energy sources and their economic
success is unknown.
However,as more money is poured
into these technologies, the price
will decline. Competition between
companies will result in demand to
produce renewable energy at a lower
price. The only thing needed is that
initial investment, to kick-start the
renewables industry.
Governmental bodies have this
kick-starting ability. With the EU
targeting to limit global warming
at 2 degrees from pre-industrial
levels, it is counter-intuitive for
the UK government to cut funding
observation, even sort of a running
joke, that Imperial “has no girls”, a
statement that all too often extends
into the wider world of research.
Women in the UK fill only 9% of
non-medical STEM posts and this
is a problem, not just for equality
but for science itself.
These issues have been thrust back
into the spotlight over the weekend
due to the Borlaug Dialogue
conference, which focuses on food
security in the developing world.The
Borlaug convention created waves
this year when the central message
emerging from the discussions had
an unexpected emphasis on the
need for female researchers.
The convention wasn’t all talk
when it came to including women
either, with 3 key heavyweight
female speakers including Chelsea
Clinton the Vice Chairwoman
of the Clinton Foundation and
Florence Chenoweth, the Minister
of Agriculture for Liberia. This
wasn’t framed as an issue of political
correctness but instead a matter
vital to achieving the “Zero Hunger”
goal set for 2030, perhaps one of the
most ambitious targets on the list.

It is as
much about
institutional
transformation
as it is about
investing in
individuals
data showing that disadvantages for
women in agriculture also include a
lack of opportunities that drag down
the efficiency of the whole system.
As the FAO’s official statement
explained, “if women had the same
access to productive resources as
men, they could increase yields on
their farms by 20-30%”.
According to World Food
Programme, if there were equal
opportunities for farmers the
number of undernourished people
in the world would decrease by
150 million people. Developing
Money is green? Bank of England in awe
for renewable energies. Lacking
support, it is not surprising that the
“evil” oil companies are doing little
to change their main energy source.
However, small steps are being
taken. Shell has predicted that by
2050 oil and gas will still play a
central role, but this will plateau
by 2100. As a company, it aims
to meet the 2 degree target and is
slowly investing more to have a
future that works with nature for a
sustainable energy supply. All that’s
needed is other companies, such as
Exon,to be convinced that a greener
approach will benefit the company
economically in the future.
Although there is no silver bullet
solution, a lack of funding by
governmental bodies is a limiting
factor to the growth of renewables.
Without public demand, it is
unlikely that governments will
aspire to invest in such bodies, and
such demand is in turn unlikely to
present itself, when the result will
probably be tax increases.
It is ultimately a vicious cycle,
controlled by profit and power.
The public does not care enough to
invest, thus the politicians similarly
lack interest.The public will not care
until the effects are immediate and
this lack of immediacy ultimately
fuels our complacency towards
climate change.

countries, where an estimated 13%
of the population goes hungry,
would benefit the most from such
measures.
So the question remains: if an
increased female presence is what’s
needed how do we achieve that? The
solution presented by the director
of African Women in Agricultural
Research and Development, Dr.
Wanjiru Kamau-Rutenberg, is a
difficult one: change the culture of
scientific research. She stated the
goal is “as much about institutional
transformation as it is about
investing in individuals”.
A problem this complex needs
to be address on multiple levels if
meaningful change is to happen. A
wide range of measures to improve
conditions of maternity leave, equal
pay and encouraging interest from a
young age are essential for success.
Scientific culture does have
at least one thing going for it
though; science likes to aim high.
In all likelihood not all the Global
Goals will be met by 2030, but by
continuing these discussions the
research community can make more
of an impact on more sources of
inequality than they could have ever
predicted.
