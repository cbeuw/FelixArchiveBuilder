“Almost every day I meet brilliant

that the Chinese community at

According to college, there are
2000 Chinese students currently
studying at Imperial.

Imperial medics fight contract changes
O
ver 20,000 people took
part in a protest march
in London against
proposed government
changes to junior doctors’ contracts
last Saturday. Protests also took
place in Belfast, Nottingham and
Dundee.
Medical students, NHS workers
and members of the public joined
the crowds of junior doctors
who marched on Westminster in
objection to the planned changes,
which are due to be introduced next
August.
The proposed terms of the new
contract include a pay cut of up to
30% for those in some specialties
and the reclassification of ‘normal
working hours’ to include Saturdays
and later evening finishes, moving
from 7pm to 10pm.
Protesters have argued that the
extended hours would negatively
affect the quality of patient care, as
“overworked” junior doctors would
be expected to work up to 90 hours
each week.
Jennie Watson, ICU Deputy
President (Welfare), who is also a
medical student, said it was good to
see“so many of my fellow medics out
fighting for the future of the NHS,
the patients and our profession”.
The British Medical Association
(BMA) has announced that a strike
ballot will take place next month.

members had not been “taken
lightly”, said junior doctors’ leader
Dr Johann Malawana. “The
government’s refusal to work with
us through genuine negotiations
and their threat to impose new
contracts that we believe are unsafe

met with some criticism. Pockets
of protesters lined Pall Mall as Xi

Buckingham Palace in a carriage.
The BBC’s political editor, Laura
Kuenssberg, asked Mr Xi why the
British public would want to do
business with a country with such a
“deeply troubling attitude to human
rights”. The British steel industry
is also unhappy over the visit, as
it coincides with parts of a large
steel corporation here going into
administration, which many say
is down to the influx of a cheaper
Chinese product.
