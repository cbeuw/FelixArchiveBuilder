olly gee, am I an angsty
emo. The only clothing
I own is black. Black
like my soul – my
heart, which screams constantly in
I’m really moody, I walk to the park
and let black mascara be washed
down my face by my own salty tears,
as I talk to a withered oak tree –
“the only thing that understands my
suffering.”
And what is an angsty emo
without angsty emo music? This
week, to free my inner 14-year-old
who nobody understands, I listened
to The Agent Intellect, the third
album from the Detroit-based post-
punk project Protomartyr.
At first, these guys ticked all
the boxes on the ‘forgettable and
generic’checklist: weird name, faux-
intellectual album title,and cover art
“with an, um, grim aesthetic that…
uh, like totally reminds us of the
cyclicality of history or something,
man,” their producer reminds them
while sucking down the third doob
this hour (seriously, how does he
afford all that weed? Broke students
want budgeting advice).
Then I sat down and listened to it.
And again. And again. Oh, shit, it’s
good.
Greg Ahee spins slow guitar
lines, favouring single notes over
chords. The normally-thin sound
is overdriven and smeared out by a
cranked-up reverb pedal. The result
is an ominous wall of swirling sound
that fits in elegantly over the drum
and bass.
Speaking of the rhythm section,

Division. Drummer Alex Leonard
has the same plodding rhythm
as Stephen Morris, but will
occasionally lapse into something

Protomartyr’s return holds no surprises
more aggressive and animated. To
be frank, there’s nothing especially
interesting, but he definitely gets
the job done.
On first listen,I wasn’t particularly
taken by Scott Davidson’s bass
guitar. Lines fit into the background
well, but didn’t do anything on
their own – it seemed. My first
impressions don’t match up with
reality – take ‘Pontiac 87’, where
the nifty-sounding descending line
serves as an excellent counterpoint
Peppers. Very cool indeed.
The most distinct part of the
album is probably Joe Casey’s
baritone half-singing. Casey
is positively overflowing with
existential torment and a pent-
up rage – opting to sing about
topics like Satan as a teenager and
specious ideologues in the audience
of a papal visit to Michigan in
1987 (witnessed by the frontman
himself). Ominous warnings are
interspersed – on ‘Dope Cloud’:
“You dedicated your life to prayer /
That’s not gonna save you, man.”
Casey’s delivery is one of the
most striking sonic elements of
the album. The singer’s baritone is
reminiscent of Ian Curtis – but the
delivery differs. Casey’s delivery is
half-spoken, an understatement
that seems to underscore the album’s
thesis of disaffection.
So,the album is technically alright,
but how does it feel? To answer that,
one night, when I felt particularly
melancholy, I got drunk, hit up a
park, and slumped under a tree to
listen to it front-to-back. We vibed,
Protomartyr and I – I felt the burn
of Rust Belt resentment deep in my
soul. I wouldn’t say it was a spiritual
experience, but it definitely took the
Angsty Factor to a solid 9.
My biggest gripe with this
album, though, is that they don’t
do anything new. Sonically, Joy
Division’s Unknown Pleasures is a
perfectly good substitute – or any
pretty good album in the genre,
for that matter. Without Casey’s
lyrics, there’s not a lot there that’s
changing the game – rather than
stand on the shoulders of giants,
they’ve opted to hide behind them.
However, they definitely have sown
seeds of a unique identity – ‘Uncle
Mother’ is a standout track in terms
of (as Sokal put it in his seminal
paper) transgressing the boundaries.

of the human condition and the
bleakness and depravity of our

to the guitar. On ‘Dope Cloud’, the
bass felt as if Davidson was literally
pulling the rest of the band towards
the end of the song – very cool.
The niftiest groove, worthy
of special mention, came at the
beginning of ‘Uncle Mother’, and
featured an excited bassline with
splattered drumming and one hell
of a guitar hook – it almost felt
like they got drunk and forgot
they weren’t the Red Hot Chilli
Overall, this album is a well-
executed continuation of the status
quo. I wasn’t satisfied. It’s not game-
changing, but good background
music while you and your goth
friends get together and scribble in
your diaries about how your parents
just don’t get you.

t’s rare to see bands produce
such consistently great music,
and the few that do offer
substantial evolution of their
sound over time. Beach House,
Lucky Stars is no different in
this respect; it’s a continuation
of their sound that presents the
dream-poppers at their best.
Recorded at the same time as
Depression Cherry (and only released
a few months after), their latest
album strips out many of the layers
of sublime production that Beach
House have become known for.

and fuzzy - the sort of stuff you’ll
want to snuggle up to in winter.
The festive jingle of bells and
dream-like keys remain, but
there’s now a aggressiveness
exposed underneath. Although
it’s name might suggest otherwise,
Depression Cherry is certainly the
less depressing album of the two;
Thank Your Lucky Stars is the most
melancholy they have ever been.
There are times on the album
where the band shows their
sound is capable of expanding.

at Brixton Academy the
air was thick with smelly
marijuana and fruity
vapour. The fully engaged crowd
swayed, bobbed and even lurched
to the music, all focused on the man
in the centre of the stage, walled in
by a cube of screens and flashing
lights.
Last Friday (and almost half a year
later),I returned to see a pitch-black
stage lit only by a few lamps. This
was Four Tet’s modern alternative
to the last supper, bringing together
some of London’s best DJ’s and

The rest of the album sounds
like any other Beach House
record, it’s lavish and dreamy
with hazy keyboards and drum
machines driving it forward.
It was a pleasant surprise when
Beach House announced their
second album of the year,and whilst
electronic producers.
I expected one of the greatest
nights of my life, verging on a
religious experience. Instead, it was
a night bathed in white mediocrity,
devoid of any diversity or variation.
The incessant bassy drops and
uninspired samples quickly grew
tiring. There were few moments
where the crowd truly came alive,
and most of these were when Four
Tet played some of his more high-
profile reworks including his recent
remix of Eric Prydz’s Opus.
To call the all-nighter
disappointing would be an
understatement; I left disillusioned
not only with my love for Four Tet
and his musical output, but the state
of London’s electronic scene.
