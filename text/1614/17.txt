Salt Lake City
here in our state of yes and smug
crystalline over mountains and horizon melt
such pretty clouds such drifting light
who is it enough for what kind of person
lives in this sweetness this clear
beauty and does not utter a single oh or no
or even I my hand clapped over my mouth my tongue caught by
what’s left in the right hand the dominant and clenched
what’s right in the left hand easily tossed
catching instead malaise a coma of indifference
swirling in our stunning vestibule
mourning the self just getting by
in a theocracy of pretense and defense
here in my state of smog and so what
the night begins with sugar
