FEATURES
Free education for all!
O
n the 4th
of November
there’s going to be a
big demonstration
in London, calling
for free education, and Imperial
students are going. It’s been
called by the National Campaign
Against Fees and Cuts (NCAFC),
a democratically organised group
of students in both Further and
Higher Education. Their demo last
year got a good 10,000 people on
the streets.
A group of Imperial students
are going to this demonstration as
an Imperial bloc – the third this
year mobilising our students, after
Imperial Medics joined a protest
against proposed changes to junior
doctors’ contracts.
Organised by our Deputy
President of Welfare,Jennie Watson,
Campaigns Officer Andrew Tranter,
and yours truly,the bloc aims to show
that there are Imperial students
who believe in free education, and
are willing to do something about
it, but also to spread the word that
there are students who are political,
are organised, and who make things
happen.
If you want to come along, or
just find out what it’s all about,
search ‘Imperial goes to the Free Ed
National Demo’ on Facebook.
To get a flavour of what the
demo’s objectives are, I sat down
with Monty Shield,a member of the
National Committee of NCAFC.
FELIX: Could you give a brief
overview of the demo, and what it
stands for?
M: We’re fighting against the
government’s education cuts and
fighting for a better, fully funded,
free and democratic education
system.The government is attacking

working class students.They’ve gone
on from the raising of tuition fees in
2010 to £9,000 to targeting loads of
aspects, in Further Education and
in Higher Education as well. As
an example: they have completely
removed maintenance grants in
Higher Education for students
starting next year. And a National
Union of Students (NUS) survey
in July revealed that over a third
of students would have chosen
not to go to university without the
maintenance grant system.
And in Further Education the
24% cut in February was followed
by a recent 2.5% cut once the
Conservatives won the election.
This has directly led to the
disadvantaging of working class
and international students and
migrants because it led to massive
cuts for the English for Speakers
of Other Languages course in FE
institutions, which thousands relied
on and will now have around 16,000
places cut nationally. There are also
plans to freeze the loan repayment
earning threshold at £21,000, which
will force poorer earners to pay
more.
FELIX: That’s because of
inflation?
M: Yeah, so inflation and the
average wage rise over time, but the
threshold for repayment stays the
same. So over time that £21,000
is worth less and poorer people
will have to pay more in relative
terms. So as I say, they are attacking
working class students in all sorts of
ways.
And as if they couldn’t stop at
that, there is also the PREVENT
programme for tackling ‘extremism’,
which tries to force lecturers and
university councillors, amongst
others, to report students who don’t
fit in with ‘British values’. Which
is ridiculous because it means
that you could say in a seminar
or something that you think we
shouldn’t have the Queen as head of
state, as her involvement in policy
and government is undemocratic,
and according to the law you
could legitimately be reported and
monitored by the government for
saying that. So it’s absurd and an
attack on our freedom of speech. It’s
also the case that the government
are using this policy as a way of
legally targeting, monitoring and
discriminating against Muslim
students across the country. We
really need to fight it.
But then it’s not just a negative
demonstration, it’s not just against
the current system; it proposes a
vision for a better education system.
FELIX: Cool, what’s that vision?
M: So when we say free, partly
that means getting rid of tuition
fees and supplying universal living
grants for everyone, but we also
want a fully liberated university
system – part of NCAFC’s policy
is to fight for universities to be
run democratically, by a mixture
of students, workers, and academic
staff. We’re fighting to get rid of all
the barriers to education that go far

beyond just costs.
FELIX: Could you speak a bit
about the barriers that exist for
international students?
M: The government is heavily
attacking international students.
One of the biggest things is the
reduction in the post-study work
visa.It’s ridiculous that international
students are forced out of the
country after finishing their degree.
Everyone should have a right to live,
work and travel where they want.
[The foreign secretary, Theresa May
recently announced plans to reduce
this to no time at all – students
would be forced to leave as soon as
they have graduated.]
International students are also
now forced to pay £150 to use the
NHS – a service that should be free
for everyone.
On the 17th
of November the
National Union of Students is
organising a walkout in universities
across the country to protest against
attacks on international students –
the idea being that home, EU and
non-EU students will all walk out
together in solidarity.
FELIX: I’ve had a couple of
international students say to me
something along the lines of: “I
don’t want to start shit in a country
where I’m a guest,I could get kicked
out”. What would you say to those
students?
M: The government attacks
international students and at the
same time threatens them with
deportation if they resist and protest,
so I think there is a very real pressure
on international students to not
fight against the attacks on them.
The only way to stop this and the
government changes I mentioned
before is if as many people as
possible challenge collectively. So
while the pressure is there, if you
feel you can get involved and come
on the demonstration then please
do and we can all fight together
against these changes.
FELIX: Imperial is pretty
apolitical, and apathetic towards
politics, and our student elections
are very apolitical. However, we
have one of the highest turnouts
for our elections in the country. Do
you have any remarks about apathy
among students today?
M: Well, I did about 20 minutes
of leafleting for the Demo last week,
and the responses from Imperial
students were all like “Oh yeah I
do believe in free education”, and
the only thing was that they didn’t
yet know the demo was happening.
So, about apathy: not fighting
something like this is not the same
as staying neutral towards it. When
you do nothing you let the dominant
forces call the shots, and in this case
that’s the government - apathy lets
the government in power do what
it wants to do unopposed. So really
the choice is: let the government
continue to attack working class
students, let it continue to attack
international students and migrants.
Or oppose those attacks together.
Because as sad as it is, if we don’t
oppose it together, it will happen.
But what is exciting is that our
opposition can make a massive
difference.
The protest takes place on Wednesday
the 3rd
of November.
