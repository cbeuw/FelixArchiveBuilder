Health Centre
This stall is concerned with the services
that the Health Centre has to offer. There
will be a representative present who can
advise students on many matters
including family planning, abortion,
sexually transmitted diseases and many
others including:
Testing for HIV
When the body is infected with AIDS, it
reacts by producing antibodies which can
be detected in the blood. If a test
produces a positive result, the person is
said to be antibody positive, i.e. HIV
Positive. However, a negative result does
not necessarily mean that a person has
not got the virus. Antibodies take, on
average, 2-3 months to develop, so if you
think you may have contracted AIDS
over the last few months it may be too
early for them to show up on the test.
The decision about whether or not to
have the 'AIDS Test' needs careful
thought. Just having the test, whatever
the result, can affect your chance of
getting life assurance. If you feel that you
would like to have a test, for peace of
mind, you can discuss it with the
representative from the Health Centre.
The Smear Test
Cervical Cancer kills 2,000 women every
year in the UK, with the vast majority
never having had a cervical smear test.
The disease is however, nearly always
preventable, which is why it is so
important that any woman who has ever
had sexual intercourse should have a
cervical smear test.
The earlier you start having sexual
intercourse, the greater the risk of
developing cervical cancer. Using a
barrier method of contraception, like a
condom or diaphragm, every time you
have sex will help to protect the cervix
from possible infection by viruses, and
may thus reduce the risk.
Cancer of the cervix can be prevented
if changes in the cells which precede it
are treated. A cervical smear test will
determine whether the cells are normal
or not and if the smear is 'abnormal'
further investigation will take place. It is
very important that women have regular
smear tests every three to five years—so
if you would like to find out more about
having a cervical smear test the
representative from the Health Centre
will be able to advise.
Nightline
Nightline was formed twenty years ago
by students at Imperial to provide a
confidential listening and information
service for students. Today we cover
most London Colleges and Polytechnics
with our volunteers being recruited from
all these Institutions.
The service that we provide every
night of term from 6pm to 8am is two-
fold; firstly we will listen in a non-
judgemental and non-directive manner
providing you with a chance to sort out
how you feel or what you want to do
when faced with a difficult situation;
secondly, and of equal importance, is our
information service on anything from
What's On in London or train times to
contraception issues or late night
chemists.
Call us any night of term on 071-436
5561 (the number is on your Union Card)
or, if you want to help then see us at the
fair.
Alcohol
What's wrong with having a drink now
and then?
-Probably nothing, if that's what it is—
having a drink now and then.
There are many reasons why we drink.
Most people say they drink to enjoy
themselves and to help them relax with
family or friends..Others say* they drink
because there's nothing better to do, or
they're depressed. It could be anything.
Drinking is all about being sociable, but
it depends on how much and why you
drink. If you don't go over the limit then
you probably can be more lively and
friendly. But it's obvious, usually at a pub
or party, who's had too much to drink
because they really aren't worth talking
to! They either make total idiots of
themselves or end up in a fight.
If you want to enjoy drinking you need
to be aware of when you've had enough?
Counting your alcohol 'units' is a good
way to watch your drinking habits. Find
out more about alcohol and the limits at
the Health Fair. There is also a computer
analysis game on alcohol which, with
your unit control score, will tell you what
affect your drinking is having on your
body and your pocket.

stall completely devoted to stress, come
along and talk to an expert or to one of
the stress relaxation sessions that have
been organised.
Smoking
There is no magic way of giving up
smoking. People find their own ways to
give up, but many ex-smokers, botji
heavy and light smokers have found this
general advice helpful.
1. Prepare yourself. Think about when
and where you usually have a cigarette.
Once you've stopped smoking, these
times and places are going to be the
danger spots, so work out how you are
going to deal with them.
2. Pick a day: Set a target day for giving
up. Make it a day when you will not be
under much stress.
3. Stop. Give up and don't smoke any
cigarettes. Take one day at a time. Every
day without a cigarette is a success.
If you want to pick a day to give up
soon, March 13th is 'National No Smoking
Day' and sponsor forms to give up
smoking on that day are available in the
Union Office. All money raised will go to
Rag.
Nine out of ten ex-smokers gave up
entirely on their own. But if you've tried
before and found it very difficult you
might find one of these aids helpful:
Nicotine Chewing Gum (available on
prescription only) other chewing gums
and tablets, acupuncture or hypnosis, you
could also come along to the Giving Up
Smoking Seminar on Friday.
Healthy Eating
A brief guide to healthy eating:
•Cut down on fat, sugar and salt
• Eat more fibre-rich foods
• Eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables
• Get plenty of variety in what you eat
But how do you know if your diet is
really healthy and how do you set about
changing your diet. This stall has
information and advice to help you
improve what you eat. There will be
displays showing the nutritional content
of popular foods and food available in
College, and also free recipe leaflets.
