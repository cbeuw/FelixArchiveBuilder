Welcome to Welfare Week
This.is Imperial College Union "Healthy
Lifestyles" week. The philosophy is to
^courage students to look after
imselves but not to preach to them.
Events organised this week are lively and
varied.
The week kicks off with a stress
relaxation session today. Although not
traditionally regarded as a health hazard,
stress can be a contributory factor to
many forms of illness. The session will
help to counter stress by showing
different relaxation techniques.
The Contagious Theatre C o m p a n y will be
coming to the Union this evening to
present 'Scoring'. Contagious have
performed at m a n y sites as varied as Hull
University, Wolverhampton Polytechnic
and Pentonville Prison. T h e Independent
praised 'Scoring', stating that " T h e
laughter of the audience is like a great
river breaking its banks". Scoring is a one
and a half hour charge through the blood
stream that blasts alcohol and drug abuse
to insignificance with a buzz that is
unforgettable. It carries no Government
Health W a r n i n g , has no ill side effects
and is completely non- addictive.
The main event of the w e e k is the
Health Fair w h i c h will be situated in the
JCR. There will be a variety of stalls
advertising healthy activities and services.
More details of this are given inside. A l l
visitors to the fair will be given a
"goodies b a g " containing a range of
healthy products courtesy of Flora and
Mates, amongst others. The Health Fair is
on Thursday and Friday from 12-2 pm.
Try to get along to the Welfare Week -
it's educational, it's fun, it's free!
Scoring
Scoring is a one and half hour charge through the blood
tf~>eam that blasts alcohol and drug abuse to insignificance -
|V/ith a buzz that is unforgetable. Scoring carries no
Government Health Warning, has no ill side-effects and is
completely non - addictive.
The show is based on five characters and begins at The
Bench w h i c h is the last piece of furniture at the exit of a
well - k n o w n rehabilitation unit. It is a place where highly
dramatic l i f e - t i m e decisions are m a d e - t o drop out or'to
remain w i t h the programme. F r o m this point the characters
are introduced through flashbacks to reveal their interwoven
histories. Subject matter is dealt w i t h using dramatic
sequences, but also dance and music to a background of
tape/slide effects.
Our research is based on information, including case studies,
from the C a m p a i g n Against Drug A b u s e , Therapeutic
I Communities, T h e Police, Terrence Higgins Trust and other
agencies that Contagious has dealt w i t h previously.
The project combines a high level of entertainment with
, essential information that approaches the subject w i t h hope,
I optimism and humour. Scoring represents an excellent night
out in contagious style.
Designed to respond to the concerns of young people o n this
issue, the showattacks notions of fashionability and
glamorisation of alcohol and drug abuse.
I Scoring does-not take the judgemental view, but offers
accurate a n d supportive information so that y o u n g people can
make responsible choices about lifestyles and behaviour.
