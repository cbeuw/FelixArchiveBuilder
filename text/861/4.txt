Wakey! Wakey! POLL TAX! STUDENT LOANS! NO
HOUSING BENEFIT! LONDON TUBE FARES! If you

GOVERNMENT MINISTERS. VISITING IC.

ROADS ON ANTI-LOANS MARCHES AND GET
MYSELF ARRESTED.

THEY TAKE ME TO COURT.
- I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT WE
THREATEN TO OCCUPY IC REGISTRY OFFICES TO
PREVENT THEM HANDING OVER STUDENT NAMES
FOR THE POLL-TAX.
-I PROMISE TO DO ALL I CAN TO GET THE
MESSAGE ACROSS THAT STUDENTS WILL SOON
NOT BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO STUDY IN LONDON,
-I PROMISE TO HOLD BENEFIT EVENTS FOR
1. ANTI-POLL TAX
2. ANTI-LOANS
3. ANIMAL RIGHTS.
AND TO OPEN UP IC UNION SO THAT OUTSIDERS
CAN COME TO EVENTS.
-I PROMISE TO DO LOADS AND LOADS, IN FACT
ANYTHING YOU WANT (ALMOST) FOR RAG.
- I PROMISE TO DO ALL THE OTHER THINGS
HON. SECS ARE REALLY SUPPOSED TO DO AS
NICELY AND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
I HAVE A DREAM TO MAKE THE WORLD GREEN,
MAKE EVERYONE HAPPY AND TO SAVE NICE
LITTLE FURY ANIMALS FROM NASTY SADISTS

HON SEC Murray Williamson, proposed by Ralph Greenwell
Proposal
During his time at College Murray has proved himself
to have exceptional organisational abilities.
In his second year Murray was Guilds Ents Chair,
during which time he organised the first Guilds'
Carnival to make a profit for three years, and
organised the first Guilds May Ball, which now looks
set to be a permanent fixture on the College Calendar.
Last year Murray was C&GU Hon. Sec. and did a
sterling job for Guilds in organising the Freshers'
Buffets, Dinner and Dance and all the elections, he
was also an ordinary member of ICU Council. This
year he is chairman of the ICU House Committee and
is a Council rep. to various committees.
Murray's experience in College makes him the best
qualified candidate for Hon. Sec. (Events)
Manifesto
I am standing for Hon. Sec. because I want to do the
job and will endeavour to do it well. I am not standing
on any political rostrum and did not chose the post
of Hon. Sec. on the grounds that it was the sabbatical
post with least opposition.
At present a great amount of the Hon. See's time
is consumed by dealing with room bookings. Within
the next few months a suite of PCs is being purchased
for the ICU offices. With a computerised system the
whole booking process should be made more efficient.
This would then leave more time to organise the
internal and external events of ICU.
A feeling around college is that the 'Union' runs the
Union for itself. If the same people always attend the
UGMs then policy brought up will reflect their views.
To get other people to attend better publicity is
needed, also contentious issues always get a good
turn out. Don't be surprised if you see risque motions
being proposed next year!
DEPUTY PRESIDENT Ben Turner, proposed by Dave Osborne
Ben Turner did not submit a manifesto in time for
inclusion.
ALL POSTS New Election, proposed by anon
I am standing for all the sabbatical posts, because I
believe students should have the choice of calling for
a new election if they do not believe any of the
candidates standing are suitable for the posts.
If elected, I promise to do absolutely nothing for you
next year. What I guarantee is a rerun of the election
or elections in which I win. If you think that all of the
candidates standing for a post are useless, then vote
for me. After all, I am the only candidate who can be
relied upon to fulfil their election promises in full.
