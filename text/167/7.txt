1st X I STILL U N B E A T E N *
The 1st X I have now played six games
without defeat. Since the last report Dul-
wich II-XI, U C and Epsom have all been de-
feated. We were perhaps fortunate to beat
Dulwich and U C . as the forward line didn't
really "link" in either match. However, they
took their chances well and the defence per-
formed admirably. In the Epsom match he
forwards at last found their form and with
the defence once again emerging unbeaten
we had our best match of the season- This
form was particularly heartening as this was
the 1st round of the U L cup when we once
again meet King's College. The team for this
match is: Sham, Peters, /Sinclair, Skinner,
Jorvit, Anketell, Phillips, King, Carter, Pane-
sar and Clarke. The result of the cup match
is in the stop press. Should we be successful
on Wednesday our main rivals for the cup
will be the winners of the U C v. L S E match,
but it is dangerous to make any predictions
at this stage.
The second team beat Dulwich and drew
with Epsom, while the 3rd team lost at Dul-
wich ajjd beat Epsom. The fourth team how-
ever lost both matches and are finding it
difficult to combine together as the team
changes from week to week. On the whole
the club have enjoyed a successful start to
the season. The captain is particularly
pleased with the keenness shown by all mem-
bers in ticking off early and regularly and
if this spirit is maintained a good season is

An influx of talented and enthusiastic
freshmen has put new life into last year's
somewhat faded Swimming Club. The re-
turn to College on ex-IC captain, Roger
Harford, strengthens a swimming team for
which high hopes are held in this year's U L
championships. For the first time i n memory,
the outlook is more favourable for swimm-
ing than for water polo, but three teams are
being fielded regularly and adequate reserve
strength is available.
On the first Friday club evening, the sec-
ond team had a close win over a UC-I swim-
ming team (37i to 36|), Godfrey and Cliff
Davies winning individual events. The U C
team was far superior in the polo winning
by 5 goals to 1. The new IC first team play-
ing its first match as a team, beat Barclays
Bank 3-1- Jones was impressive as a safe-
keeper whilst Harford, Davis and Tedd com-
bined well.
A n IC team, depleted by the withdrawal
of U L players, managed to draw a swimm-
ing fxture against Cardiff University, Hen-
nessy and Peggs being winners of their in-
dividual event. The home side fielded a
strong polo team including a Welsh Inter-
national and won a hard game (8-4), although
IC had them down to 5-4 at half time.
The highlights of this term's program is
the IC I'ntercoilsgiate Carnival at U L U
Pool on Friday evening, December 8th. The
President's race .always raises a laugh and
it's possible that the true form of certain
ICWA swimmers will be revealed for the
first time.
The big question is„ whether Guilds' four
year stranglehold on the waterpolo cup can
be broken. This doubtful but it's no secret
IC B E A T S O X F O R D U N I V E R S I T Y (4-3)
On Wed. 1st November, the IC Judo Club
paid a visit to Oxford for their first match
of the term. The contests were conducted
with the dignity associated with the older
University their Dojo being inside an old
church dimly lit with delightful chandeliers!
In the first contest M . Potterill fought hard
but was eventually beaten on the ground by
the Oxford man. P. Williams drew the next
contest after a strenuous battle. The first TC
win came after John Milson quickly threw his
opponent with kc+soto-gari. Unfortunately
we received a set back in the next two con-
tests, Clive Cohen just losing by a wasari
(half-point) and John Downing met the Ox-
ford Goliath but was unable to repeat Da-
vid's performance.
At this point we were losing by three con-
tests to one, but Mike Wame quickly im-
proved the position, first gaining wasari
with an O-soto-gari throw and immediately
following up with a kesa-gatame hold down
for the full point Roger Simons continued
the improvement first with tai-otoshi and
then kesa-gatama. This brought us level with
Oxford on contests for the last contest be-
tween the captains of the teams. Our hopes
were i temporarily dashed as John Bowles
soon lost a wasari, but then took the advice
of the Duke and set about to rectify matters.
He levelled the score with tai-otoshi and then
went on to win with kami-shio-gatame hold
down. Thus IC won with 4 contests to 3,
one being drawn.
