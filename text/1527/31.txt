56th BFI London Film Festival
In 1998 Poland, rapper Magik forms
three-piece rap group Paktfonica
(apparently meaning “the pact next to
the sound of the speakers”). The ﬁlm is
based on his story, from getting them
together, troubles in getting noticed and
signed, why you should not cheat on
your wife and mother of your child even
if you are a big-time rap artist, and ﬁnally
the ending of his own life later which

propelled Magik into legendary status in
Poland.
For those far removed from any of this
knowledge (which included myself),
the ﬁlm does a great job in taking the
viewer through the whole thing and the
storyline is never annoyingly ambiguous.
What is slightly confusing at ﬁrst though,
is distinguishing each rapper from
another as they are all young, white,
male skinheads in sports joggers and
sweaters - basically a British chav, but in
an era when everyone was one.
The similarities to Britain don’t stop
there and, although probably not an
intention of the ﬁlm, they make you
realise just how globalised western
culture has become. This also makes the
ﬁlm more accessible to a wider, non-
Polish speaking audience.

Rust and Bone ﬁnd legitimate employment - eventually
becoming an illegal ﬁghter. Soon after
their meeting, Stéphanie loses both
legs to a whale in a horriﬁc accident,
sending her into a spiral of self-loathing
and isolation. Surprisingly she reaches
out to the struggling father, and the
two form an unlikely connection. Ali’s
indifference to Stéphanie’s condition
helps her to accept her body, physically
and sexually; with her providing a locus
for his transient existence.
Consistently we ask ourselves who is
stronger; Ali, the largely silent, casual-
sex addicted ﬁghter prone to outbursts
of explosive rage; or Stéphanie,
ﬁghting to regain control of a life with
new limitations. Our perspective
is challenged - his life unravels and
relationship with his son deteriorates,
whilst Stéphanie rebuilds herself,
ﬁguratively and literally. In a scene
where Cotillard is seen negotiating with
to the internet and the dial tone rings
through the speakers.
This snippet of Polish culture is
refreshing in comparison to Hollywood
style ﬁlms taking over many cinema
genres today. Big time hip-hop artists
who live with their parents in a concrete
estate and struggle to make ends meet,
contrast greatly with the ﬁlthy rich stars
of our generation.
What is also very interesting is that
there is no bias towards any character.
Although Magik is depicted as the most
talented and passionate member of the
group, his inevitable downfall from his
own misbehaviour makes you hold back
on sympathy for his situation.
There are no unrealistic extremes:
no fairytale happy endings or tragic
ﬁnales full of morality and how you
should change your life. The troubled
relationship between Magik and his
girlfriend invokes empathy as it lacks the
idiotic ﬁrst-world type love problems
usually seen in modern day movies.
None of the characters are devastatingly
beautiful or wear fancy clothes with
unmaintainable fancy hair.
Surprisingly, the ﬁlm makes it terribly
easy for a wannabe scientist spending
daily life in Kensington to relate to
a wannabe hip hop artist living in
industrial Poland trying to get through
life’s struggles and make it into the big
time. Deﬁnitely worth a watch for hip
hop or non-hip hop fans alike.

the gypsies involved in illegal ﬁghting
(women unwelcome), standing tall on
newly ﬁtted prostheses, she becomes
the queen of strength and bad girl.
A ﬁlm with so
much tragedy could
easily become
m e l o d r a m a t i c ,
but it isn’t – its
minimal script and
abrupt switches
between realism and
expressionism keeps
the ﬁlm sobering and
unflinching. Audiard
experiments with light
and texture, and uses
sound layering – often
loud and confusing
enough to obscure the
dialogue, to reflect
the chaotic and fragile
nature of Ali and
Stéphanie’s relationship.
The ﬁlm’s soundtrack is often
unexpected, opening and closing
with Bon Iver’s haunting double part
‘Wolves’. Also featured is Katy Perry’s
‘Firework’, an unusual choice for a
powerful scene which features a newly
disabled Cotillard re-enacting her Orca
routine to the sky. It is a great testament
to Audiard’s skill to take such an obvious
song and use it to enhance a scene of
great profundity.
Despite excellent
performances
from Cotillard,
Schoenaerts
and Verdure, the
ﬁlm could at times
feel episodic and
unconnected;withevents
punctuating a seemingly
aimless screenplay rather
than ﬁtting together to
form a cohesive piece. Nonetheless, the
almost symbiotic relationship between
Ali and Sam is deeply impressive; fraught
with love and rage. When Sam is put in
mortal danger, our reaction, like Ali’s, is
visceral. Cotillard acts with her body as
much as with her voice – each movement
deliberate and instinctual. Coupled with
some clever CGI work, her portrayal
of an amputee is as believable as it is
moving.
This is a ﬁlm about approaches to the
human body – it is about pain that is
sought and pain that is inflicted. The
theme of control is explored – with
obvious parallels drawn between Ali
and the whales, with Stéphanie’s need
to control large mammals. Ever present
is the power of nature, of the cycles of
degradation and renewal, and physical
strength. This is not a commercial love
story, but it is one that will not fail to
move even the coldest of viewers.

The Sapphires
Katy Bettany Film Editor
If country music is about sitting around
whining about loss, and soul music is
about getting up and doing something
about it, then ‘The Sapphires’ channels
soul to its core. This is a ﬁlm with a
strong political message; touching upon
the lost generation, black oppression
and Australia’s murky past – but far
from reveling in darkness, it is a joyful
celebration of a group of Aborigine
women who break the shackles of racism
to sing soul music to US troops during
the Vietnam war.
Based on the true story of writer
Tony Briggs’ mother and aunt, and
adaption of the successful stage show,
it is 1968 and four Aborigine women
meet a hapless Irish man, Dave Lovelace
(O’Dowd), whilst performing in a
whites-only Outback pub. Despite their
love of Country and Western, he quickly
identiﬁes them as the best thing around,
becomes their manager, converts them
to soul, and embarks with them on a
journey to Saigon to entertain the US
marine corps.
The ﬁlm explores an important part
of Australian history. From the 1800s
well into the 70s, pale skinned Aborigine
children were taken from their families
by Federal and State officials in the
shameful attempt to integrate the
children with white people, misguidedly
believing that the
black population
would ‘die out’.
These children
would form the
‘Lost Generation’,
part of Australia’s
past I’m sure it
would rather forget:
however, the ﬁlm does not whine or
labour the point. Kay, a member of the
Lost Generation, reconnects with her
indigenous roots, making peace with the
family she lost in her childhood. The ﬁlm
isabouthealing,forgiveness,andmoving
forward – something that modern day
Australians living in a country that still
struggles with racism, will connect with.
The sisters are as one dimensional
as the signs Lovelace hangs around
their necks to remind him – and them
– of their roles. Julie (Mauboy), ‘lead
singer’, Kay (Sebbens), ‘dance leader’,
Cynthia (Tapsell) ‘the sexy one’, and
Gail (Mailman), originally ‘???’ but
quickly becomes mother hen. The four
lack serious character development for
this to be a truly exceptional ﬁlm, but
the vocals are fantastic, and O’Dowd,
fresh from his success in Bridesmaids, is
reliably funny, providing some laugh out
loud moments, and is a convincing soul
man.
The soundtrack is the true star of the
ﬁlm.CoversofSmokeyRobinson,Marvin
GayeandFourTops,andoriginalsbySam
and Dave, make this ﬁlm a celebration
of authentic Motown soul. Mauboy’s
voice is made for soul; rich, deep with
incredible range; but at times the girls
lack the emotional connection with the
classic songs to really shine. The most
moving songs are the ones sung in Yorta
Yorta, an indigenous language: it is here
you can hear the plight of the Aborigine
people loudest.
Making comparisons to the
similar Dreamgirls will only lead to
disappointment. Go with an open
mind and the willingness to forgive the
occasional weak moment - if you love
soul music this is a feel-good ﬁlm not to
be missed.
