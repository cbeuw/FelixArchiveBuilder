The modern vamp tragedy
Lucia Podhorska sinks her teeth into The Vampire Diaries
aving already re-
viewed True Blood
and Buﬀy, it was
only a matter of time
before I shared with
you my thoughts on the current
number one (according to some)
vampire show on TV.
As with True Blood, The Vam-
pire Diaries is based on a series
of books. Written by L.J. Smith,
the book series of the same name
focuses on the character of or-
phaned Elena Gilbert (Nina Do-
brev) from the ﬁctional town of
Mystic Falls, who falls in love with
the vampire Stefan Salvatore (Paul
Wesley). To make things slightly
more complicated, Stefan’s older
brother Damon (Ian Somerhalder)
is also a vampire with his heart set
on wreaking havoc in the small
town and generally making Stefan
and Elena’s lives miserable. It’s not
too long, however, before we see
his softer side and – unsurpris-
ingly – a love triangle forms. As
the show progresses, Mystic Falls
also becomes host to other creepy
crawlies, ranging from witches to
werewolves and ghosts.
I was initially sceptical about TVD,
simply because I’ve put BTVS on a
pedestal and don’t think anything
in the same category can ever be
as good. That being said, I almost
always get drawn into new vam-
pire shows…In the case of TVD, it
was Ian Somerhalder (who I loved
on LOST) who tempted me. And
it is mostly Ian Somerhalder who
has kept me coming back.
At the beginning of the series, the
majority of the characters come
oﬀ as being typical vapid Ameri-
can teenagers and it takes a long
time for some of them to develop.
With the exception of Meredith
Grey on Grey’s Anatomy, for me
Elena is the most annoying main
character in any of the shows I am
currently watching. I understand
that it must be horribly diﬃcult
being loved by two gorgeous un-
dead men, but honestly, woman,
have some self-respect and stop
acting like your whole life is one
big sacriﬁce. Thank God for Da-
mon’s eyes, otherwise I would
have long since tuned out. Why
Elena doesn’t come to her senses
and chooses Damon over Stefan is
beyond me – the tortured vampire
act is getting kind of old and isn’t
particularly attractive.
In terms of storyline, the makers
of the show rely overly on over-
dramatization and teenage angst.
Maybe my age is simply starting to
show or perhaps I am too cynical,
but there isn’t much in the show
that I can relate to. While themes
of love, hate, loss and revenge (to
name but a few) are all tackled,
they don’t really resonate and there
is no clear moral message behind
the stories. The constant negotia-
tions and re-negotiations between
the good guys and the bad vam-
pires is also something that is be-
ginning to get on my nerves. With
so many threats ﬂying around but
next to zero follow-through, the
otherwise delightful character of
Klaus lacks credibility and comes
oﬀ more like a neutered puppy
than the scariest vampire of all
time.
Because of the general popular-
ity of vampires as supernatural
creatures, as well as the fascina-
tion with human/vampire rela-
tionships, there is a vast amount
of ﬁlms and literature devoted to
the subject. It’s therefore becom-
ing increasingly diﬃcult to ﬁnd a
show that brings something new
to the genre. It seems that the only
thing that’s being done is to change
the mythology of vampires – spe-
ciﬁcally their reaction to the sun
and whether or not it kills them.
As a fan of the supernatural, this
really frustrates me, as authors
keep coming up with new ways of
having vampires walk in the sun
and their status of ‘creature of the
night’ is slowly but surely being
taken away, leaving behind crea-
tures that aren’t nearly as scary or
tragic as they should be.
I really do have a love/hate rela-
tionship with TVD. On the one
hand, as is clear from this review,
there are many things I don’t like
about it. On the other hand, it is
the kind of show that, once you
start, you do want to continue
watching it. The ﬁrst episode of
season 4 aired last week and once
things settle down a bit, I know it
will be on my list of series I need to
catch up on.
