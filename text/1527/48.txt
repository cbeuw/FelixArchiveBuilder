IC football prepared for a Saturday
morning 7am ﬂight in the only way
it knew how: by consuming pint after
pint in the Union on the last night of
term. We hadn’t even left the Union
before B-Eth-Eth (Milo McGrath)
had fallen victim to one of Asterix’s
(Charles Gassuer) concoctions. After
ﬁnishing in the Union we all come
to the logical conclusion that it was
much better to stay awake through
the night than let a hangover set in…
The real ﬁrst match of tour was
played in London Victoria station
between American Psycho (Ben Al-
drich) and whoever else could be
arsed. It happened to be a real cagey
aﬀair, with neither team really look-
ing to pounce on the opposition’s
mistakes. Strangers would occasion-
ally have complete disregard for the
game and walk straight through it,
before a member of the security team
politely asked us to stop, which we
reluctantly did. With the energy of
amoebas we managed to make it into
Munich. B-eth-eth threw up on the
ﬂight, purely due to his chronic travel
sickness and nothing to do with prior
activities.
The ﬁrst day was spent in Munich’s
picturesque Englischer Garten and
some casual shirts vs skins action was
played out here before we headed
back to the hostel to begin the night’s
activities. Tour matchbox began in
the hostel, this led to a casual descent
into mayhem when all deaths were
punishable by beer bong.
Munich has a smorgasbord of tour-
isty things for IC football to wade
around. The 1972 Olympic Park was
the ﬁrst port of call on Sunday, and
being of huge sentimental value the
beer bong had to come with. We
moved onto the BMW museum be-
fore deciding to sample Munich’s real
selling point – beer gardens. Having
grown bored of using it in the usual
old 2 person fashion it was time for
some freestyle bonging, with the Us-
ain Bong and the Culture Bong being
a few highlights. It should be noted at
this point that Fett-und-Kahl (Jonny
Hill) decided to disappear for 40
minutes, managing to avoid beer and
spend some quality time with soli-
taire on his phone.
At the hostel the triumphant
thrashing of Italy by Spain in the Euro
2012 ﬁnal was viewed before the night
descended into chaos in Munich’s
Kultfabrik region, a place that pro-
claims itself to be the ‘biggest party
zone in Europe’. It soon became clear
though that this was a lie. Brown 0.5
(James Brown) was particularly suc-
cessful with a lady on this night as a
result of shouting “FITTING HELL”
in the vague direction of large gangs
of women, thus proving the theory
that if you throw enough shit at the
wall some of it will stick. Fett-und-
Kahl can verify Brown 0.5’s romantic
activities.
After taking a trip to the Allianz
Arena (the setting of Chelsea’s hero-
ics in the Champion’s League just a
few weeks prior) we had our ﬁrst of-
ﬁcial game of football against FC E-
Garten. Finding the ground proved a
real challenge for the otherwise very
capable and well organised Twat-Sec
(Giles Mann). The job was made all
the easier when the entire team, fol-
lowing behind him (Kony looking
like a ﬁctional character) resolved to
shout continuously: “Giles, where are
we going?”
Looking dishevelled Poppins tried
to psych us up for the game with
a warm-up ﬁt for a Royal Marine
squadron. Once we’d satisﬁed his ap-
petite for craning, it was time to of-
fer the lungs a little warm up too, and
before long we felt ready to start the
game.
We passed scruﬃly from the oﬀ.
The selected starting eleven consist-
ed of players from the 6’s through to
the 1’s and even a couple of Old boys.
With none of us having played prop-
erly since the season ﬁnished last
March, the team struggled to think
the same game and gel as a unit. A
particularly tired Dry Nights (Jack
Peacock) was getting uncharacteris-
tically ragged at left back and FC E-
Garten managed to ﬁnd some space
and capitalise when he was out of po-
sition for an earlier opener.
Come half time E-Garten had man-
aged to net again and some substitu-
tions were needed. Among the squad
of 20 there were 5 keepers and this
didn’t exactly lend itself to making
textbook substitutions, although on
the whole the keepers turned out to
be a pleasant surprise: Framp-stains
(Pete Frampton) creating space and
making some good runs up front;
Gollum (Dave Docherty) keeping the
ball well in midﬁeld. Letting the keep-
ers union down was Twat-Sec who
had less than zero eﬀect on the game.
Sadly the theme of shabby football
continued throughout the game and a
third and fourth goal were soon con-
ceded. After a shot from an E-Garten
forward rebounded oﬀ the post it was
clear that Kony (Bolly), having dived
to his left to try and save the shot, was
not going to get up. Unfortunately, ly-
ing face down in the goalmouth was
not a strategy that stopped another E-
Gartner tapping in the rebound.
Small consolation did come in the
ﬁnal minutes though when Fett und
Kahl played a delectable spread to
Gump (Chris Neilsen), who received,
went on a mazy run, beat multiple
players and ﬁnally put it on a plate for
club captain Fry-sexual (Tom Fryatt)
to slot home. Despite the day’s losses,
the last night in Munich descended
into havoc. Kony introduced some
primal box to the night’s delights
with Dry Nights setting a new record
for how long it took him to get put
to bed.
The ﬁnal leg of tour was in Prague
– a much more walkable city. On
the way, The Airborne Rangers en-
tertained themselves for the 7 hour
coach journey with nothing but a mi-
crophone and their own wit.
The ﬁrst night in Prague produced
an event of epic proportion: the im-
promptu 3 hour IC football dance oﬀ.
Debate still rages on about which side
actually won but in my opinion when
it comes to dance-oﬀs it really is the
taking part that counts.
Unfortunately, playing in the Great
Strahov stadium (capacity 240,000 –
fraction full 0%) was not enough to
inspire the tour team to victory the
next. Another disappointing perfor-
mance led to a scoreline of 4-1, but
not without its own notable mo-
ments…
After being named ‘super-sub’ for
coming on at centre back and imme-
diately conceding from a corner, Pop-
pins (Tim Smithy Beasley) redeemed
himself by playing a delicious ball
over the top for Framp-stains (Pete
Frampton) to run onto and slot it in
the back of the net. By contrast, Fat-
thew (Matt Can) produced a piece of
football which deﬁed belief and won
him player of tour when he let the
ball through his legs, beat a man, then
went on a 40 yard run down the left
wing. Having put so much eﬀort in to
the prior 6 seconds he decided to end
the run by falling over.
Nights 5, 6 & 7 descended into an-
archy, pandemonium and carnage re-
spectively. Other highlights of Prague
included topping the world charts at
the self-service pub, the goddess of
the cave, silentbox and hat-gate.
Thanks everyone for coming. A
special thanks to Twat-Sec for or-
ganising everything, albeit at the last
minute.
