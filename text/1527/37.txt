OMG WTF FTL FTW
When I first met the new Games
Editor we both agreed that Felix
needed reviews of proper main-
stream games. Indie games are great
fun and it’s fantastic how the games
industry is moving in this direction.
However, those triple-A £40 games
are the bread and butter of most
people’s collections and what most
people end up playing. But then I
played FTL and decided to disregard
that entire conversation.
FTL: Faster Than Light is about as
indie as it gets: made by a handful
of people and funded through the
currently very popular Kickstarter
service. This game offers the closest
experience you’ll ever get to starring
in your very own sci-fi, space-far-
ing movie. If you’re as nerdy as me
(and this is Imperial so I reckon the
people less nerdy than me are in a
minority) then you’ll love it. On the
game’s website this game is defined
as ‘Roguelike’ and if you weren’t a
gamer in the very early 80s you prob-
ably have no idea what this means.
This genre, pioneered by the fantasy
RPG Rogue, involves randomised
dungeons, and the rather mean con-
cept of ‘permadeath’; once you died
in Rogue, everything your character
achieved is lost forever. It fell out
of fashion by the late 80s, although
influences of this genre still remain.
The Diablo series is famous for its
randomised environments and the
most recent instalment included the
aptly named hardcore mode, bring-
ing permadeath back into the main-
stream.
FTL is essentially a roguelike game
in space. You, the player, start with
a rudimentary ship and a skeleton
crew, and are tasked to deliver vi-
tal information to the other side of
a vast and random universe. Every
time you ‘jump’ your ship from star
system to star system, some com-
pletely random event occurs. Maybe
you find a shop to buy new weap-
ons and crew for your ship. Maybe
it’s some friendly travellers who
give you some fuel to help you on
your journey. More often than not
though, it’s a hostile ship that just
wants to blow you out of the sky
and steal everything you’ve got. The
ship to ship combat is the meat of
the game and boy it’s both incred-
ibly good and really quite hard. As
with any good roguelike game, death
is completely permanent. If you die,
then everything you’ve achieved in
your journey is dust and you’re sent
right back to the start of the game.
It’s also here, where the sci-fi nerd in
me screams with glee (I hope you’re
charging him for your services –
Games Ed).
Once in battle, you have to man-
age both the ship’s power consump-
tion and the actions of your crew.
The weapons, shields, engines and a
variety of other systems have to be
powered to function and you gain
bonuses when they are manned by a
crew member. As you progress and
unlock new weapons, systems, and
crew members, you realise how deep
the combat is. You can purchase a
drone bay and launch automated
drones to attack your enemies or
repair your ship. You could teleport
you crew into your enemy’s ship and
pick off the enemy one crew mem-
ber at a time. Or maybe you prefer
buying a cloaking device and being
almost impossible to hit. Of course
as you progress to more difficult
areas your enemies have all these
capabilities too. It’s at these points
that the game can become incred-
ibly overwhelming, especially on
the first few attempts. Often you’re
dealing with not only superior fire-
power, but boarding parties wreak-
ing havoc in your ship and maybe a
few fires to top it off. To succeed you
must learn to make use of the games
pause function. At any point you
can stop the action and issue sev-
eral commands at once. Order one
crew member to repair the drone
bay maybe? Target your weapons
on the enemy’s O2
supply to suffo-
cate the crew? Maybe open an air-
lock to flush out the boarding party
and that pesky fire? Of course when
the shit really hits the fan you can
always shout, in your best Captain
Kirk impression, ‘Divert all power to
the engines!!’ and jump the hell out
of there. However, due to the ran-
dom nature of the game, you have
absolutely no idea what to expect af-
ter that next jump. There have been
many situations where I’ve jumped
straight from the frying pan and into
the fire.
See, the games random component
is both its best feature and its worst.
To win FTL, you must not rush and
should instead focus primarily on
preparing for the more difficult bat-
tles ahead. Sometimes you get lucky.
A few easy battles, a free weapon
from a nice stranger and maybe a
couple of new crew members en-
able you to really improve your ships
performance. Other times you just
jump into empty space, time and
time again, gaining nothing and los-
ing fuel. Occasionally, the game can
just be incredibly unfair and pit you
in an absolutely horrible battle, test-
ing you in every way. However, at
the end of the day, each time you hit
that ‘New Game’ button you know
it’s going to be a different adventure.
As you get better and more experi-
enced in the game, you’re rewarded
with new starting ships, making
each new game even fresher.
As far as true criticisms go, events
that don’t involve combat can be a
tad dull. Occasionally you’re asked
if you want to send some crew
members down to a planet, or help
a trapped ship stuck in an asteroid
field. These events are just displayed
in boxes of text with a random out-
come. You might gain
something useful or
suffer damage to
your ship or even
lose a vital crew
member. Also, I’m not a huge fan
of the game’s crew-to-crew combat
when boarding enemy ships, or be-
ing boarded yourself. These instanc-
es basically involve your crew and
the enemy crew, being in the same
room together, slowly picking away
at each other’s health. The only real
strategy seems to be to know when
to quickly move your crew to a dif-
ferent room and it’s far less exciting
that the true ship to ship combat.
Each attempt at FTL is like its
own self-contained episode of Star
Trek – just where more often than
not, everyone dies at the end. Also,
on that note, I’d recommend against
naming your starting crew mem-
bers. I named a female crew mem-
ber after my girlfriend and she got
eaten by a giant spider after about
five minutes of playing. It was sad.

Hi, I just warped here and
this is crazy, but we’re being
boarded... so drone bay maybe?
Not everyone who reads Felix may be aware that there’s a major competitive
side to Team Fortress 2 a.k.a. Hat Fortress 2. Well, there is. Earlier this week, the
team sign-ups for Season 13 of the European Team Fortress 2 League opened
up.
Ignore the ‘European’ part of the name – this league is the largest competitive
league in the world. Also, forget the madness that you find on public servers
– these games are for teams that communicate and coordinate their strategy,
making for some amazing games.
There are divisions for all levels of play, so if you feel like gauging your skills
against others, why not pop along to etf2l.org. Watch out for the Highlander
game-type, as it’s great fun, even if you’re just a spectator. As per the High-
lander motto of “There can only be one”, the TF2 Highlander rules insist that
within your team of 9 players, each one must be a different class.
