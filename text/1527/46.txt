On race morning I got out of bed just
after 4 and gorged myself on porridge
and muesli. It’s an odd feeling waking
up so early knowing that you’re going
to spend an entire day exercising. Al-
most all of it will be uncomfortable (as
in you’d kind of like to do something
else instead) and a good chunk of it
will be really painful (as in you’d really
like to be doing something else).
The race started at 7am, and I spent
the ﬁnal 10 minute countdown in a
numb daze. Pretty much the sole focus
of my life for half a year had been to
get ready for that moment. The beach
shelved quite sharply so within a cou-
ple of paces I was out of my depth.
Don’t be under any impression that I’d
started swimming though - there were
far too many people for that! The sea
had become a maelstrom of hands and
legs and it would have been crazy to
put your head under water lest it be
smacked by a ﬂailing limb.
After a couple of hundred metres
though, the ﬁeld stretched out and I
could ﬁnd my stroke. With 1500 oth-
er people around it feels like you’re
swimming downstream in a river, so
the two lap course seemed to ﬂy by. I
was surprised to get out of the water
in just over an hour - over 15 minutes
quicker than I’d ever managed in the
pool - and not really feeling any worse
for wear. 2.4 miles down, 138.2 to go
and the warm glow of never having to
swim again radiating through me.
We then had to run up the cliﬀ and
through the town to our bikes which
were about 1km away. The noise was
incredible. People were lining the
street 2 or 3 deep on both sides of the
road and it seemed like all of them had

Becoming Ironman: Part 2

little bells that they were ringing as
loud as they could. You can say what
you like about the Welsh, but they do
love to see people doing silly things,
even if it’s early on a Sunday morning.
The cycle was a two lap course - one
big one of about seventy miles, and
then a smaller loop of part of that
course to make up the rest of the dis-
tance. Unfortunately, the only part
of the course that was even a teensy
bit ﬂat was the bit that we only did
once. There was 2400m of ascent in
total. Silver lining? 2400m of descent!
The miles passed by slowly, and I was
managing to hold a fairly steady speed
of 16 mph. Everything seemed to be
going well, until the weather turned.
First it started drizzling, and then it
started chucking it down. Not only did
this drive many of the people that had
been lining the route and doing such a
good job of shouting support/obsceni-
ties at us inside, it also meant that we
had to really slow down on the de-
scents. I passed quite a few people who
had come oﬀ on the winding roads
and lost a lot of skin, or worse, broken
their collarbones. It had turned from
a nice ride in beautiful countryside to
a grim and cold survival exercise. The
survival element was ampliﬁed by 3
punctures in the last 20km (damn you
thin race tyres) which left me shiver-
ing so violently that I couldn’t keep my
front wheel straight.
Having lost a fair bit of time with
all the tube changing faﬀ I was keen
to get on with the running so that I’d
be able to get to the end and therefore
never have to exercise again. The run
course was a 4 lap aﬀair, and consisted
of about 4km up a big hill, 4km back
down it, and then another 2km wig-
gling around the streets of Tenby. You
were given a diﬀerent coloured band
on each lap to denote where you’d
got to on the course. The band sys-
tem might seem lovely to organisers,
but from a slow kid’s (i.e. my) point of
view, it was cruelty. When I was on my
ﬁrst lap, plenty of the quick kids had
got their last band. The envy was pal-
pable as people in my position glared
longingly at the arms of those who
were further up the ﬁeld.
My ﬁrst lap went well, and I was
comfortably ticking over at just under
8 minutes per mile. On the second lap
though, things nosedived and they
didn’t recover. My stomach started
to feel incredibly uncomfortable and
within a couple of miles I had to dive
into the nearest portaloo. I thought
this might improve matters, but there
was no let up. Eating and drinking
only made things worse, so for the
last 30km or so of the run, no food or
drink passed my lips as I just couldn’t
keep it down. By the third and fourth
laps, without going into too much
detail, my digestive system had com-
pletely shut down and it felt less like
I was running a marathon than I was
desperately running from one porta-
loo to the next. These last three hours
of the race were the least comfortable
of my entire life. It felt like my stom-
ach was turning inside out, and I really
can’t explain how I’d ended up in that
state.
Support from the all sorts of sources
was really what kept me going. Short
chats with other competitors, the
crowds in Tenby itself (especially out-
side the pubs as the night came in),
seeing my family and friends - these
were all vital distractions from the
pain. I had expected pain, but not in
this form - I’d imagined that my mus-
cles would be screaming at me by this
stage, but it really wasn’t the case. All I
could do was keep trudging on know-
ing that each step brought me closer
to the end. I’d had my running gear
printed up with the CF Trust logo.
The real high point of every lap was
passing a family who clearly had some
connection with the charity. They had
a little daughter who must’ve been
6 or 7, and every time I’d come past
she’d scream “keep going Mr. Cystic
Fibrosis!” and, like so many of the kids
around the course, put her hand out
for a sweaty high ﬁve. Their parents
would often thank you as if you’d done
them a massive favour, not realising
how much of a beneﬁt it was provid-
ing us athletes as a distraction!
By the time I picked up the pink and
ﬁnal band, I was broken. Everything
hurt, and taking into account portaloo
breaks my pace had dropped to well
over 11 minutes per mile. At the ﬁn-
ishing line they have a big red carpet
that you run up and under an arch with
enormous crowds lining the street. I’d
like to have sucked up the atmosphere
more than I did, but I was in such a
daze that it seemed over in a ﬂash. As
I came under the arch, I just managed
to take in the commentator saying
“Ned Yoxall, you are an Ironman!” All
of a sudden, it didn’t seem like such a
big deal and if anything I was a little
embarrassed by the American-style
brashness of it all. I managed to raise
my arms and smile as I ﬁnished in 13
hours and 46 minutes. I was quickly
bustled into a holding pen where I
was plied with recovery drinks, given
my ﬁnishers medal by the mayor and
asked if I wanted to receive any medi-
cal attention. All I wanted was to be
able to drink something after such
a long time without hydration, and I
tentatively sipped the drinks I’d been
given. There was as much a feeling of
relief as there was of achievement.
So, was it all worth it? Well, from a
sponsorship point of view, a resound-
ing yes. I hope to raise a bit more
through a video made from various
footage taken by my family and I on
the day. From a personal point of view,
I’m glad I’ve done it. Would I do it
again? No. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy
being ﬁt and regular exercise, but the
amount of exercise required seriously
restricts the rest of your life. You can’t
drink. You’re often tired and grumpy.
You can’t even spend weekends with
your partner because you’re oﬀ on a
long bike ride/run and then you feel
knackered when you get back. You
don’t have any ﬂexibility to make the
most of the other things in life, and
unless your absolute passion in life
is being as ﬁt as you can, for me it’s a
trade I was only willing to make for a
short time. There is a residual glow,
though, in the back of my mind. I’m
pretty proud to have ﬁnished some-
thing that at ﬁrst glance seemed im-
possible, even if that’s not going to be
my lifestyle forever.
