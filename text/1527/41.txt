TWITTER HIGHLIGHT OF THE WEEK
Craig David @CraigDavid
Thank you 4 all the continued love U show me
4 my music, especially Born To Do It! This gets
mesuperexcitedaboutmy newalbumnext
year!
No, no, no – thank you
Craig. After all, from
where else would we
have gained the knowl-
edge of how to properly
rendevous? Or the correct
sequence of the days of
the week? Craig David for
an OBE. #fillmein
it back, relax, and raise your
mug. If you’ve followed Cof-
fee Break’s advice thus far,
you’ve secured a £100,000
per year salary job – well
done you! But how can you possibly
spend that amount of wonga wisely?
I’m not the ﬁrst and deﬁnitely won’t
be the last to bemoan the current
state of the economy. Spending those
hard-earned dollars is a risky business
in this climate, but you can’t let it get
you down! Handily this is where this
week’s Coﬀee Break comes in like a
shot of caﬀeine to a lethargic cat. Pe-
ruse the following option and you’ll be
living the life of luxury, but not at the
expense of your Swiss bank account
overdraft!
INVEST IN A SHED
Spacious. Wooden. Storage. All in-
spiring words. Inspiring, much like a
shed. But this purchase is simply not
for your spare lawnmowers or jacuzzi
area, but is instead a future invest-
ment, much like a car or a bottle of
WKD. Sheds are going to be hot in
about ten years time. Believe it. Buy
it. Brush it (with wood varnish, pref-
erably).
Nothing to lose folks, except your
shed credentials. The Business section
should deﬁnitely just be printing this
every week in lieu of their usual con-
tent, just saying. I have the acumen of
Branson and the charm of Sugar.
