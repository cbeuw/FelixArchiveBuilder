FRIDAY 19 OCTOBER

‘m not here to tell you how to
make notes or to advise you
on exam technique. The fol-
lowing are a few dirty tricks
that I’ve learnt though my
years at Imperial. I’m a physicist so
that’s what I’ve written about, but
maybe you can transfer some of this
to your own course – unless it’s geol-
ogy, I have no tips on colouring-in.
The ﬁrst thing to remember is
all you leave here with is a grade. It
doesn’t matter that you picked the
hardest subjects or that your supervi-
sor messed you around. The outside
world doesn’t care. All they see is: 1st
– clever (might be an arse), 2:1 – did
alright, probably well rounded, 2:2 –
too much sport, 3rd or below – ex-
pensive toilet paper. These grades are
awarded with huge boundaries and
even if you miss one by a few percent
you will still get an interview to bring
you up.
This makes the undergrad obses-
sion with getting every last mark
frankly ridiculous. Don’t get me
wrong, the mid-morning panic be-
fore an assessed problem sheet dead-
line is quite amusing, but it won’t
make a diﬀerence to your grade.
A problem sheet is worthless and
one mark is 0.017 times that. The aim
of your ﬁrst year is to learn how to
learn. Don’t waste hours minus sign
hunting when you could be grasping
concepts (or enjoying yourself). If
you care that much, just cheat.
Students are the best teachers so
talk to your peers. You don’t get any
marks for deriving the whole of phys-
ics by yourself. For me, half the time I
was stuck it was just a mistake in the
lecture notes.
If you’re looking for people to work
with, ignore the front row. They’re
not clever, they just need people to
think they are. The clever kid is sit-
ting on their own, quietly conﬁdent
and deﬁnitely not stopping the lec-
ture every ﬁve minutes to ask yet an-
other inane question.
Stand up for yourself, particularly
with demonstrators. These are gen-
erally young PhD students with little
marking experience a.k.a easy pick-
ings. After each lab report you will
have a feedback session where they
point out the reasons you’ve been
marked down. Your job is to listen
very carefully and wait for them to
slip up. Perhaps they said you left
something out or that you made an
error in your maths. Are they right?
If not you should very politely point
it out.
Don’t spend your time sitting in
front of books because you’re too
guilty to go out but not working be-
cause you’re too bored to pick up a
“The clever kid is sitting on their own, quietly confident and definitely not stopping the lecture every five minutes.”
How to get a first: a blagger’s guide
The Old Man offers some wise words to new students
pen. Work when you mean to work
and play when you mean to play. If
you don’t have an interest outside
your studies you’ll burn out or at the
very least have a miserable time.
Go to tutorials, if you’re wavering
on a grade boundary the backing of
your tutor will count for a lot more
than those extra assessed problem
sheet marks.
This one might be a bit contro-
versial, but, personally, I don’t think
there’s much value in ﬁguring out
problem sheets from scratch. Exams
are about reproducing mathematical
tricks, so I generally waited for the
answers before attempting any.
Courses
Choice of courses is paramount, get
it right and it can easily earn you a
grade. First and foremost choose
courses based on who’s lecturing.
Get a duﬀ lecturer with bad notes
and you’ll be up a popular creek
without a paddle. There are some lec-
turers who require students to think
during exams – these sadists should
be avoided at all costs. Fortunately
there are others that perennially set
easy papers. Find out who these won-
derful people are and make your life
a bit easier.
It is of course deeply unfair that
the (in)competence of the lecturer
should have a greater impact on your
grade than your own (in)competence.
You might naively expect that some
central system would sort this out.
And it’s true such a system does exist,
however, in practice, I’ve never seen
it work, and the same lecturers give
high marks year after year.
After second year there are no com-
pulsory courses (in Physics), so this is
the point where assumed knowledge
stops. Yet lots of courses require the
same background, which must be
taught in each course. This means
there’s room for the astute student to
economise their learning by maxim-
ising the overlap between subjects.
In Physics, for example, General
Relativity, Quantum Field Theory
and Uniﬁcation all require a good
grasp of Einsteinian notation. Do
all three and you get taught it three
times, have three times the practice
and get three times the marks, but
only have to learn it once.
Some of the conceptually harder
courses can be a good way to go.
Quantum Information might seem
like a lot to get your head around.
However, once you get there you
can almost guarantee a high mark
(~90%). Get a few of these under your
belt and it can really take the strain
oﬀ your average
I
What if you’re stuck?
It’s important to recognise when
you’re completely lost. Courses gen-
erally build on themselves, so when
this happens it’s probably because
you’ve missed something early on.
Forget about keeping up with the
course and go back to the start, it’s
much more important to understand
the basics.
If you can phrase your question go
to oﬃce hours, they’re a massively
under used resource. Talk to your
peers.
If all that fails remember no ex-
planation is ever perfect. Whether
it’s textbooks or lecture notes they
all inevitably miss out something. If
you use more than one of these the
chances are they won’t both have
missed the same thing.
Revision
Start early, the Easter Holiday has a
misleading title and even this might
be cutting it a bit ﬁne. Get a timetable
and stick to it. It’s better to learn half
of all of your courses than all of half
of them. Stop playing sports, become
a recluse and for God sake don’t do 24
hour musical or any other nonsense
that gets in the way of your exams.
Finally
You’re not at school anymore. If you
fail the only person that looks bad is
you. Lecturers, tutors and demon-
strators are too busy with their own
research to drag you through your
degree. You are the master of your
own destiny, you can fail spectacu-
larly and no one will blink an eye. You
might not like it but “research reigns,
students are pains” – even when
they’re paying £9,000 a year.
