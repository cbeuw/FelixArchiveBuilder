FRIDAY 19 OCTOBER
Feedback woes highlighted
The National Student Survey (NSS) was
established in 2005 by HEFCE (the body
administering government funding of
UK universities), in order to indepen-
dently gather feedback from students
about their institutions. It is carried out
every year in the spring: ﬁnal-year un-
dergraduates in almost every university
in the UK answer questions spanning a
broad range of topics, from the quality
of teaching and assessment, to the ad-
equacy of the learning resources avail-
able, to their satisfaction with the Union.
Response is generally high: last year, two-
thirdsofeligiblestudentstookthesurvey.

Since the survey is the single biggest
source of student feedback available to
universities, college administrators study
its results carefully. The survey has tan-
gible inﬂuence, too, since the scores are
a signiﬁcant factor in the calculation of
university league table rankings. In the
inﬂuential Guardian University Guide,
for instance, a university’s student satis-

recent plummet in the league tables.
How did we do?
An analysis of the 2012 results makes
for some interesting reading. At Impe-
rial, 86% of respondents agreed that
“overall, I am satisﬁed with the quality
of my course.” This result is only mar-
ginally lower than the English average
of 87%, though signiﬁcantly lower than
corresponding scores from institutions
of similar prestige as Imperial.
Analysing responses to the survey’s
more speciﬁc questions indicates the ar-
easwheretheCollegeislacking.Asinthe
past,studentfeedbackwasamajorstum-
bling block. Only 55% of students said
they were happy with the feedback they
had received – the second lowest score
in the country. This puts it miles behind
its rivals: by comparison, the ﬁgures for
UCL and Kings are 60 and 61 per cent.
Medics seem to epitomise this discon-
tent at the lack of feedback. While 85%
were satisﬁed with the overall quality of
the course, only 32% thought feedback
had helped them clarify things they did
not understand, and a mere 28% agreed
that they had “received detailed com-
ments on my work.”
One particularly disgruntled medic,
asked by Felix to explain why they were
so dissatisﬁed with her course, replied:
“Because our personal tutors don’t know
who we are, our lecturers don’t care who
we are and we basically just teach our-
selves.”
Insuﬃcient feedback has been a rec-
ognised issue for a number of years, and
the College has taken some steps to ad-
dress it, including imposing deadlines on
departments for the returning of marked
work. This seems to have been reﬂected
in this year’s results; 55% compared with
51% last year. Though still not great, this
is certainly an improvement.
The teaching scores, too, were far from
spectacular – especially when compared
with other similarly prestigious institu-
tions. Amongst the elite Russell Group
Universities, only students at LSE were
more dissatisﬁed with teaching (while
Oxford and Cambridge topped the table
in both teaching and feedback scores).
So where does all this dissatisfaction
come from? Various causes have been
proposed: the usual suspects of a heavy
workload and moribund social life in-
evitably crop up. But when results are
compared across diﬀerent departments,
a more nuanced story emerges.
Students in Geology, for instance, did
not share their colleague’s general dis-
content: a whooping 92% were satisﬁed
with the level of feedback, while 98%
were satisﬁed with the overall course: far
andawaythehighestscoreinCollege.Fe-
lix talked to some Geologists to ﬁnd out
what their department was doing right:
“As far as I know we’re the only depart-
ment to have an ‘Academic Tutor’ who
oversees all aspects of the undergraduate
degree. It’s eﬀectively the same as a Di-
rector of Undergraduate Studies – how-
ever, from what I’ve heard, ours is a lot
more dedicated to their job than others.
She knows everyone’s names from inter-
view day, and will still keep in touch after
graduation.
“I think people knowing each other
is crucial to satisfaction with the degree
course. If you’re friends with so many
people in every other year as well as your
own, you’re going to enjoy your time in
the department. Obviously having such a
small department helps with things like
this, however I think the social side of the
RSMU contributes signiﬁcantly by put-
ting on unmissable events that everyone
goes to and has a great time at.”
Another student summed up this co-
operative atmosphere: “We get a lot of
support from Lorraine (the Academic
Tutor), everyone gets jobs in oil compa-
nies, we have ﬁeld trips, teachers all get
on well with the students and there is a
general feeling of camaraderie.”
Incontrast,only42%ofChemistrystu-
dents found the feedback they received
helpful (though 87% thought their teach-
ers were good at explaining things). Felix
spoke to a chemistry student, who told
us:
“The main problem our year found
with feedback was that the quality of the
feedback you received depended sig-
niﬁcantly on which person was marking
your script and which lab you were doing
at the time.”
Still, there are some signs that things
areimproving.Resultshavegenerallyim-
proved from last year. Satisfaction with
feedback has risen 4%. Speaking with
ﬁrst and second-year students, it seems
that the changes the College has made
in the last few years have had a tangible
eﬀect.
Of course, these improvements won’t
be fully seen in the survey results for
another few years. And in any case, it
doesn’t reﬂect well on the College that it
took some shocking survey results – and
a consequent plunge in the league tables
– for them to take student satisfaction
seriously.
Doug Hunt, Deputy President (Educa-
tion) gave Felix this statement about the
NSS: “Imperial College Union believes
that the NSS is highly useful when taking
into account the changes that have been
made in some departments in order to
improve their NSS score especially with
respect to assessment and feedback. One
example of this is the restructuring of the
chemistry course that has proven highly
popular with students who have beneﬁt-
ed from this.
However the Union disagrees with
heavily weighting the NSS satisfaction
rankings in university league tables,
which we feel misleads able prospective
students and potentially devalues our
highlytalentedstudentsandalumni,who
are of a world class quality.”
