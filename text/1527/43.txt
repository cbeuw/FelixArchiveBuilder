This week a guy messages
you saying that he saw your
profile on the sci-fi face-
book group and he loves
sci-fi too and is looking to
meet up with like-minded
people so would you like to
go for a drink with him? You
say no and go back and go
back to playing World of
Warcraft.
This week you put an LSD-
laced sugar cube in your
personal tutor’s tea for lolz.
He discovers a cure for can-
cer in his elevated state of
mind and wins the Nobel
Prize, but you get kicked out
of uni for poisoning a supe-
rior. You ask him for a refer-
ence before you leave but he
just sits there looking smug.
This week you fly 24 miles
above the earth riding a uni-
corn and jump from its back,
with no oxygen supply and no
parachute, wearing only your
rave shades. As you land safely
on your feet, you reckon you’ve
trumped Baumgartner, but you
get arrested for public indecen-
cy and everyone laughs at how
silly your penis looked in freefall.
This week you lament the fact
you didn’t get laid in fresher’s
fortnight; not even a drunken
fumble in the disabled toilets
in Metric. Two whole weeks
of opportunity to finally lose
your virginity and you still
have less experience than a
neutered cat. Oh well, there’s
always next year – welcome
to Imperial.
This week you stay over at
a friend’s house and sleep-
walk into her parents’ bed.
You wake up confused and
wearing a strap-on, and start
apologising profusely. But
they say there is no need to
apologise, they had a great
time last night ;-) You will nev-
er be able to look your friend
in the eye again.
This week you lose a bet
and have to decide between
drinking a poo smoothie or a
cum milkshake. You weigh
up the pro’s and con’s: on the
one hand, the poo smoothie
has a lower calorific content
but on the other, the milk-
shake has a smoother, more
homogenous texture. What’s
it going to be?
This week you’re getting
touched up in Pizza Express
by your Personal Tutor’s hus-
band, and frankly you’re loving
it. On the one hand, you can
kiss goodbye to being able to
look your tutor in the eye ever
again, but in the other hand
you may never get this close to
some 50 Shades of Grey action
with a professor-fucker again.
This week you’re on a date with
your personal tutor’s husband.
It’s all going really well, he’s fun-
ny, charming and good look-
ing. You begin to see your per-
sonal tutor in a new light, she
must be an amazing woman
to snare such a catch of man.
This train of thought it interrupt-
ed by her husband placing his
hand on your thigh.
This week you sign up for
OkCupid, and get matched
with your personal tutor’s
husband. While thinking
about what to do, you look
down at your chest, where
luckily you got YOLO tat-
tooed upside down. Inspired
by your inked bon-mot, you
message him and arrange a
date.
This week, you’re sat in your
personal tutor’s office organ-
ising being able to take a
deferred year from studies
due to having missed final
exams because of a case of
gonorrhoea. In an attempt
to make you feel better,
your tutor confides that she
too has had to overcome it.
AWKWARD.
This week you’re walking
through a door in a building.
You step back to let a fresher
walk through first because
you’re feeling nice, and the
fresher lets the door slam
shut. This isn’t a joke, this
happened to me and if an-
other fresher shows bad door
etiquette then I am going to
cut them.
This week your OkCupid ac-
count is buzzing with mes-
sages, all from spouses of ac-
cademics in your department.
Turns out they have a subred-
dit called r/ICfreshersnatch
with links to blurry pictures
from what appears to be a hid-
den camera. You set up an ac-
count called YOLOgrrrll1994
and buy a webcam.
H... then the O, then the... screw it: horoscopes
