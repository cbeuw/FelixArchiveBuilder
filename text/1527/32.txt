Stanley Kubrick's film
adaptation of Stephen King’s
The Shining is almost certainly
the most popular King film;
an unsettling and upsetting
chronicle of a family man's mental
breakdown. Jack Nicholson infamously
plays Jack Torrance, a struggling writer
who foolishly accepts a job as a hotel
caretaker – even in the knowledge that
the previous caretaker had gone insane
and murdered his family. Of course,
things quickly take a turn for the
worse. Deadly hedge mazes, lifts full
of blood and the terrifying Room 237
are only some of the horrors that await

Top 10 Scariest Films of All Time (spoilers rife!)

Well, it has to be said – if you
like your horror films brutal,
bleak and swimming in
blood, this is definitely
the one for you. Toby Hooper's Texas
Chainsaw Massacre was the gruesome
film that took the immoral, inbred folk
from Deliverance and turned them into a
sick, aggressive, insane clan of merciless
cannibals. Start with a very typical
opening point of a van full of teens who
run out of petrol in just the wrong place
in Texas, then throw in Leatherface (a
charming gentleman wearing human
skin and carrying, yes, a chainsaw) and
some meat-hooks – and there’s your
recipe for a pretty repugnant film that
had to fight for a distributor due to the
graphic violence. Before Leatherface
became a squealing cross-dresser in the
pretty awful Texas Chainsaw Massacre:
The Next Generation, he was a hideous
and raw horror icon, who would never
have considered a skirt.
Psycho is definitely in the
list of the greatest thrillers
of all time, and one of the
greatest parts in Alfred
Hitchcock's legendary CV.
A true master of suspense and tension,
Hitchcock crafted a memorable horror
experience with a limited cast and
even more limited budget. Nowadays,
admittedly, the actual content of Psycho
isn't as shocking as it was when it was
first released in 1960. However, it proves
Hitchcock’s skill as a director that Psycho
is still a nerve-wracking watch. The
killing of Janet Leigh's character (not
to mention the accompanying score) is
now one of the most iconic extracts in
Hollywood history.
Psycho is such a classic that a shot-
for-shot remake was made in 1998.
Wouldn’t waste your time on that one,
but honestly – the original is epic.
Psycho
Watch the whole film with
the lights on. At midday,
with the curtains open and
the radio on. And then get
ready to never, ever sleep
again. The movie's premise, a little girl
possessed by a demon, is pretty freaky
as just words on paper. But director
William Friedkin treats the horror of it
all as if it were really happening next
door to us. Before it can be defeated,
this demon must be believed in. Fathers
Karras and Merrin spend the third
act of the movie fighting the Devil for
control of the young girl’s soul. And in
doing so, Karras, a man of wavering
faith throughout most of the movie,
finally believes in the only true good
he knows by sacrificing himself to save
her. Although The Exorcist is the reason
why so many exorcism movies flood the
marketplace – it is also the reason why
they never fully deliver.
The main reason Scream is so
successful is because we finally
have a group of characters
that have all seen the same
scary films we have, and who
are aware of all the clichés that go along
with the genre. However, it seems that
nobody knows more than the killer
(….killers?) who plays with his victims
mercilessly, asking them questions about
old horror films to help them guess his
next move – an almost interactive game
that the viewers can play along with.
Director Wes Craven waits for as long
as possible to pull out some very well-
executed tense scenes, with the killer’s
final reveal being realistically terrifying.

Ok, so it’s a little bit
cheesy. And the fashion
is decidedly dodgy. But
it was the 80’s – and
Friday the 13th is definitely effective.
Before this film came out – along with
it’s epic makeup effects produced by
the inimitable Tom Savini – the murder
scenes in horror movies were nowhere
evenclosetothevividnessorcreativeness
of those in Friday the 13th. It might be
a little bit dated, but when the arrow
goes through the back of poor Kevin’s
neck, you still jump. Not to mention the
screams when the

jumps out the
water behind

The first in a very (very)
long line of ‘shaky hand-held
home film’ horror movies,
such as uber-successful
Paranormal Activity, The Blair
Witch Project is actually pretty scary.
Admittedly, with hindsight and a few
years’ more filming experience, some
of the scenes are a little bit obvious
and slightly dated. But The Blair Witch
Project came out in the 90’s, when the
internet was in its infancy and spoilers
werenotpublisheddeterminedlybefore
every new scary movie release – in fact,
the internet was used in this case to
convince the public that the unnatural
goings-on in this film were real. Love it
or hate it (‘cause it makes you dizzy), the
use of the
shaky cam
here must
take credit
for a whole
new way of
freaking us
out.
You know how, for some scary
films, you have to turn the
lights on for just a few scenes?
Well in this film – don’t bother
turning them off. Suspiria gets
right to the point with a brisk double
murder early on in the plot that involves
a young lady looking out into the dark…
only to realise a pair of terrifying eyes are
staring back. This creepy start develops
into a few stabbings and hangings, and
culminates with a gruesome death by
stained-glass impalement for her and
her friend. Although
a rather typical
giallo (Italian horror
film), director Dario
Argento proves
more than capable
of creating an
environment of horror
and the supernatural –
a good, creepy watch.
Suspiria
Fantastic (sick?) director
George Romero single-
handedly created the zombie
film genre with Night of the
Living Dead in the sixties.
Ten years later, he used his massively
successful formula to make Dawn of the
Dead – the much bigger, much gorier,
and much funnier younger brother of
Night. The true brilliance of Dawn of the
Dead is the way in which it combined
standard, gruesome zombie carnage
with a humourous dose of satire and
social commentary. The question at
the end of the movie seems to be left
hanging: are modern Americans really
so different from the shambling undead
zombies? Unfortunately this message
was somewhat lost in the enjoyable, but
definitely inferior, 2004 remake.
You know it’s got to
be good if it’s a Best
Picture Oscar winner.
The Silence of the
Lambs is potentially
the scariest movie ever created around
psychological attacks and deduction.
You can blame this film all you like
for the seemingly never-ending lame
Hannibal Lecter impressions, but it gave
us one of the film industry’s most iconic
villains – not to mention the pivotal role
of Anthony Hopkins’ career. Director
Jonathan Demme is utterly relentless
with the tension, succeeding where
Ridley Scott failed in his 2001 sequel,
Hannibal, by keeping the character of
Lecter less of a caricature – and more
of a believable terror. So settle down
to 1991’s best film, maybe with a little
Chianti…

viewers. Apart from being a terrifying
film, The Shining has managed to leave
its mark on modern culture – the image
of Nicholson poking his head through a
doorway and shouting "Here's Johnny!"
is one of the most well-known movie
moments ever. A fantastically petrifying
watch… just don't expect to sleep that
night.
