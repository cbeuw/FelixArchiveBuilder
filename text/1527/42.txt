GUYS! GUUUYYYYYSSS! Just
had the best idea ever. I think I
know how to save our economy.
NOT_A_SAD_Cleggmanxxx
Are you still going on about using a
tardis to steal oil from the daleks?
Wizard_of_Ozborne
No, it’s way better than that. We rob
a bank!
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
Fuck. Why did we never think of this
before?
NOT_A_SAD_Cleggmanxxx
Possibly because we’re not as stu-
pendously retarded as George?
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
But what if it’s so stupendously re-
tarded that it’s actually genius?
Wizard_of_Ozborne
There is a barclays just around the
corner from my house. Meet at mine
say two o’clock?
willyoujoinmymiliband?
I’ve got grenades! I’m going to bring
grenades :D
Cameron_DA_Maneron
Grenade a hostage every half an
hour until they open the vaults yeah?
NOT_A_SAD_Cleggmanxxx
So you’re going to steal money
from a British bank...to save the
British economy?
Internshit
Ah, again we reach the
season where penulti-
mate year students shit
themselves thinking
about how they’re going
t o spend their next 40 years,
as the companies recruiting for in-
ternshits next year open their ap-
plications. Well, actually, most of
the good ones opened (and closed)
several weeks ago – anyone with
sense will have applied ages ago,
and those that haven’t are probably
fucked by now anyway, so might
actually learn something useful
from this helpful little guide.
Application forms
It’s 6 pm, university is over, it’s
just you, your desk and your lap-
top. And YouPorn. But whoa
there, don’t spank the monkey
just yet, because there’s applying
to be done. The initial application
is pretty straight forward: since
you’re at a “target” university, all
you really have to do is spell your
name right, and you’ll probably get
swept into the next round of ap-
plications. Some companies might
ask you why you want to work
there. You should probably avoid
any references to ‘snorting coke oﬀ
a hooker’s arse at 4 am on a Tues-
day’. Instead try ‘sniﬃng mandy oﬀ
Jimmy Savile on a Sunday’.
Psychometric testing
White men can’t jump. White men
also can’t handle online numerical
reasoning tests. So instead of in-
sulting students on campus for be-
ing from other parts of the world,
stop being a xenophobic twat
for just one second and go make
friends with some. If The Dark
Knight has taught us anything, it’s
that Mr Lau is good with calcula-
tion. In all honesty if you’re reading
Hangman for advice on applica-
tions, the odds are you’re probably
not the sort of candidate they’re
looking for, so you should seriously
consider paying someone to do this
part for you. Throw them £5 and a
calculator, run oﬀ to the library toi-
let to bash one out. It’s unlikely that
you’ll make it as far as an assess-
ment centre, and even less likely
that they’ll bother to re-test you if
you make it there. No wonder the
economy is in fucking tatters.
Interviews
If you’ve made it this far then I can
no longer guide you. In this world
it’s all about who you know. Or
blow. I managed to blow my way
into a job without an interview.
Unless you fancy genital breath for
an indeﬁnite period I suggest you
just get good at feigning competen-
cies. Assessment centres are pretty
straight forward, usually consisting
of a group exercise, case study and
interview. For the group exercise,
you’ll likely run into Hugo, head
of the investment society, sporting
his dad’s suit and a smug grin that
screams ‘massive twat’. He’ll be nice
in the foyer, but once in the arena
he’ll morph into Megacunt, spout-
ing acronyms that contribute noth-
ing of worth, doing anything in his
power to make you look like a right
nob. Shit, only ﬁve minutes left,
better shank Megacunt in the face
so you can get a word in edgeways.
That’ll show the HR folk that you’re
“assertive”, “keen to take initiative”
and “a whole bag of crazy”. Just the
sort of bright young person they’re
looking for.
Well done
Well done you. You got the intern-
ship! But wait, now you actually
have to put in time and eﬀort to
convince them that you’re worth a
spotontheirgradscheme.It’sabout
now you’ll realise that this isn’t re-
ally what you want to be doing with
your time. You want to be stretched
out on Koh Phangan, with a spliﬀ
in hand and sexual delights galore.
Instead you’ll be sporting an inner
city tan, struggling to ﬁnd the time
to ﬁt in as much as a power walk,
and snorting shit coke laced with
Daz and pubes (anyone remember
those weird Daz challenge ads, just
a side note). Hope isn’t completely
lost though, you could always kill
two birds with one stone by be-
coming Walter White in Breaking
Bad. Ditch the shitty job and cook
up some better drugs in the pro-
cess. You’ll own a nice car, and all
the while you’ll avoid paying any
tax. Not so diﬀerent from a job in
the city, really, only now it’s some
other fucker sniﬃng the pubey
coke.

Federer calm over death threat
Following the news that he received a
death threat on social networking site
Facebook, tennis player Roger Federer
is reportedly relaxed about the situa-
tion and has revealed that he is, in fact,
immortal. “Whilst it has become clear
in recent years that Federer was actual-
ly mortal on the court, oﬀ it he remains
as imperishable as ever” stated former
world number one John McEnroe.
Tournament organisers at the Shanghai
Masters were initially concerned, but
the world number one was able to as-
sure them that, should he come under
deadlyattack,hewouldburstintoﬂame
and rise, phoenix-like, from the ashes,
allowing play to continue. The Wim-
bledon champion, who metaphorically
rose from the ashes earlier in the year
to reclaim the world number one spot
and break Pete Sampras’ all time record
for weeks at number one, literally rises
from them about once every 90 years.
Federer, whose excellent forehand,
perfect movement, precision timing
and invincibility have all contributed
to his amassing 17 Grand Slam titles,
assured fans and the media at a press
conference that if he were somehow to
be “like shot in the head or stabbed in
the neck” nothing worse than his re-
incarnation would occur. The revela-
tion only increased praise for the man
some have claimed is the greatest of all
time, “It’s amazing to see the guy’s lon-
gevity. I mean sure, Jimmy [Connors],
Ivan [Lendl] and I were playing for long
time” continued McEnroe “but he’s go-
ing to be around forever”
