More con men by campus
Last week, Felix reported on a con
man operating near campus, who was
asking people to help him retrieve his
car.
This week, another student has
informed Felix of situation that is
not too dissimilar. It has come to
light that around London Fashion
Week, two men, described roughly
as “southern European” approached
a student while they were driving in
their car. The incident occurred just
outside College, on Queen’s Gate,
next to where the Bulgarian Embassy
is situated.
The student was walking home
from College when the two men ap-
proached and engaged the student in
conversation. The men said that they
were very poor and that they wanted
to sell some designer clothing for
very cheap prices to quickly obtain
money. The student immediately at-
tempted to dial 999. At this point the
two men drove up to the student and
started shouting abuse.
The student managed to get a pho-
to of the two men (pixelated, above),
and sent it in to Felix.
The two men followed the student
down Prince Consort Road, hurling
abuse in an intimidating manner.
The car that the two men were driv-
ing was described as a blue Sedan.

FRIDAY 19 OCTOBER
A response to the “Possible A&E
changes” article
en to Campus Security and the Cam-
pus Police Oﬃcer.
The student in question advised an-
yone else to: not try to interact with
them, and under no circumstances
try to get in their car or be anywhere
near an enclosed space. I was luck
enough to avoid anything more se-
rious happening to me, but this may
not always be true.
Following the story in the 5 October
2012 issue, Chelsea and Westminster
Hospital NHS Foundation Trust have
responded with the following:
“Patients and local resi-
dents support campaign to
keep A&E at Chelsea and
Westminster
Thousands of patients and local resi-
dents have supported a campaign to
keep Chelsea and Westminster as a
major hospital with a full A&E Depart-
ment, maternity and paediatric services,
and many other key services.
Chelsea and Westminster is a campus
of Imperial College London Faculty of
Medicine and one of the best perform-
ing NHS trusts in the country – rated
the safest hospital in England by the
most recent independent Dr Foster
Hospital Guide.
More than 11,000 people registered
their support for the campaign by com-
pleting a ‘Safe in our hands’ postcard
and more than 6,500 people signed a pe-
tition set up by elected representatives
of patients, members of the public and
staﬀ who sit on the hospital’s Council of
Governors.
The Shaping a healthier future public
consultation on NHS services in North
West London—drawn up by GPs, hos-
pital doctors and other health experts—
proposes that Chelsea and Westminster
is designated as a ‘major hospital’ with a
full A&E.
The consultation came to a close on 8
October and the results are now being
analysed by Ipsos Mori before a decision
is due to be made by NHS North West
London in early 2013.
If the recommendation that Chelsea
and Westminster keeps a full A&E ser-
vice is upheld, ‘blue light’ emergencies
that currently go to A&E at Charing
Cross Hospital will go to Chelsea and
Westminster instead.
However, most patients who currently
use Charing Cross A&E will still go to
the Urgent Care Centre there because
they are not emergency cases.
Chelsea and Westminster is already
making plans to expand and improve
its A&E Department to accommodate
the extra patients who would come in as
emergenciesifCharingCrosshadanUr-
gent Care Centre instead of a full A&E.
If Chelsea and Westminster was
downgraded to a local hospital without
a full A&E, not only patients who rely on
A&E would be aﬀected.
Chelsea and Westminster would also
lose its Maternity Unit, life-saving fa-
cilities for children, and many other ser-
vices.
If these services were lost to patients,
Chelsea and Westminster Hospital
would be non-viable and face the very
real threat of closure.
More information about the ‘Safe
in our hands’ campaign is available on
the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital
website at www.chelwest.nhs.uk/safein-
ourhands.”
