new colour palette to match
A timeless winter staple, black takes the throne of chic
0nce again. But this season, instead of taking a backstage
role upon which the other pieces found their roots, black
took a leap forward, hitting centre stage with a dark
mythical beat – nothing boring or dull about it at all.
Making appearances across all the catwalks, the col-
our black found itself metamorphosing constantly – in
tough patent leather at one show to sumptuous sweeping
sheers the next. Velvet, silk, fur and tweed: the key with
black this season, as always, lies in the variation of texture
and it is here that the most modern incarnations of black
are to be found.
Invest in classic pieces in black that will last a lifetime
– a vintage designer coat, an evening dress, or a chic fur
wrap for the winter chills. Black is back, for good.

FOREST
COBALT
BLACK
It may be hard for us Londoners to imagine a more com-
mon colour other than grey given that it surrounds us as
concrete pavements and towering clouds, but we must
try to remember that for those not living in a metropolis
there is another form of life: nature. And it is from here
that the colour ‘forest’ emerges.
Why forest as opposed to green I hear you ask: because
it is neither the grassy nor algae shades of nature to which
we refer. Rather, it is the deep tints of winding ivy and
plush peacock hues that are to be envied.
Keep in touch with nature, literally, with McQ’s leaf-
embellished military coats or look to Natasha Poly whose
iconic moment in Gucci’s show-stopping velvet leopard-
print Devore dress at Cannes sealed the colour into the
fashion repertoire.
Some may call it blue, but in the fashion world we prefer
cobalt this winter. Not quite dark enough to call navy, co-
balt strikes somewhere between royal and midnight.
With enough shine, the colour is electrifying as per
Moschino’s dress with its shimmy-worthy feathered skirt,
yet when sheer layers are built up into intensity a la Chris-
tian Dior, cobalt transforms into an exquisite, yet under-
stated incarnation of the colour.
But it was Stella McCartney’s take on cobalt in neat
suits and perfect tailoring that really took the colour into
the collective fashion consciousness. Never before has
businesswear looked so fresh and modern. Think back to
the reign of Thatcher, and take away the shoulder pads,
dubious politics and big hair and add a heavy dose of chic.
Now that’s a conservative party I could go to.
