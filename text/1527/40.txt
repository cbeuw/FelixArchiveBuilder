Sillicon Valley, South Ken
Serge Vasylechko explores the startup ecosystem at Imperial
wo weeks ago Imperial
saw the launch ICStart-
up - an initiative that
aims to inspire a new
generation of student
entrepreneurs. It will act
as a central hub for entrepreneurial
news and events around college,
connecting an otherwise disparate
and rich ecosystem of societies and
organizations that cater to Impe-
rial’s entrepreneurial talent. At the
core of the new framework lies an
accelerator programme, ICStartup+,
which will give students a chance
to turn their ideas into successful
startups by providing support from
experienced entrepreneurs, finan-
cial backing and access to a newly
refurbished office space, secretly
hidden in the upper floors of Beit.
Contrary to the common percep-
tion, Imperial has an extensive net-
work of organizations that spawn
the field of enterpreneurship, which
could easily rival those of any UK
or European university. Perhaps the
most prominent one is Imperial In-
novations - a technology transfer
and investment company that com-
mercialises academic research at
Imperial. To date, it has generated
an impressive portfolio of around
70 high-tech startups that cover
almost every science, engineering
and healthcare discipline taught at
Imperial. Last year, Imperial Inno-
vations created an accelerator pro-
gramme, called IDEA, that provided
students with free mentorship and
financial support for web and mo-
bile businesses. In just 9 months, the
programme has worked with over 15
student startups, many of which be-
gun from an idea on a single sheet of
paper and have consequently grown
into early stage ventures. The initia-
tive now forms part of Startup+ ac-
celerator that has expanded to focus
beyond just web and mobile appli-
cations, but also other sectors. Any
student with an idea or who would
like to meet other likeminded peo-
ple can simply drop in to the work-
shops and start building a business
around their College work.
Yet if you have a strong affin-
ity to startups that bring a
real change - social entre-
preneurship may
be something worth exploring. The
concept has gained a lot of recent
popularity and is praised by govern-
ments, private corporations as well
as social activists as a new type of
business altogether. Whilst still be-
ing for-profit, these businesses place
the importance of social rather than
monetary profits at the very core of
their business model. In essence,
their success is measured by social
change. A notable sector for social
entrepreneurship is micro-finance,
where special banks are setup to
give out loans to the poor at very
low or no interest rates. Other ex-
amples include businesses that as-
pire to transform education, health-
care or environment. Imperial Hub,
a branch of Student Hubs, is an or-
ganization that encourages student
social entrepreneurship here on
campus. So if you have a new social
business idea, you could apply to
the programme and be offered up
to £15,000 in funding with a tailored
mentorship programme alongside it
to help your business grow.
For those students who want to
try a route with more rigorous sup-
port, IED programme offers a great
opportunity to work in a multi-
disciplinary and experienced
team. Developed by the Business
School’s Entrepreneurship Hub,
a year-long programme brings
together Imperial’s engineers,
business school MBAs and Roy-
al College of Art designers to
form startups that are
coached throughout
the year in the lead
up to a £10,000 in-
vestment compe-
tition.
Still, the va-
riety of Im-
perial’s
start-
u p
ecosystem doesn’t end here. There
are many student run societies
which connect their members with
notable entrepreneurs and each
other through networking sessions,
presentations and competitions. Im-
perial Entrepreneurs is the largest
such society which offers a range of
challenging weekend competitions,
such as the Appren-
tice Challenge,
I C
Hack-
athon
a n d
Startup Weekend. The latter two in
particular let their participants run
wild with ideas to generate and test
business concepts in less than 48
hours. In November, there is also an
annual entrepreneurship conference
and a trip to Silicon Valley in April.
On top of that, there is a weekly
“Startup Mondays” feature informal
talks by London’s hottest startups
followed by relaxed socials at East-
side Bar.
Furthermore, if that seems not
enough, you will find that Imperial
College Business School has a range
of its own interesting clubs, such as
Entrepreneurs Interactive, which
host a series of thematically driven
speaker presentations, and Private
Equity and Venture Capital Club
that focuses on the advanced topic
of raising money from VCs. In
fact, if you are interested in the
latter, you’ll find that Andreas
Angelopoulos’ guest lectures
series are simply invalu-
able for an in depth un-
derstanding of this in-
dustry. At the same
time, a number
of newer clubs
have sprung
up at Impe-
rial that
c o n -
c e n -
trate on sector specific issues. For
example, OBR network, previously
known as Oxford Biotechnology
Roundtable, has been tremendously
successful with generation of mul-
tiple leads for students interested
in innovation within biotechnology
sector. As a result of this we now
have Marblar - a startup that was
jointly co-founded by students from
Oxford and Imperial. Also part of
the ICStartup+ accelerator, it has
recently been featured in all major
tech publications around the world
such as Wired magazine, Scientific
American, MIT Tech Review and
New Scientist.
The latest newcomer join the
ICStartup community is Mobile
Technology Club. Born somewhere
in EEE department last year, its fo-
cus is on workshops and real world
projects for keen mobile app devel-
opers. Of course, we are yet to see
what this will yield. Yet, with sup-
port from ICStartup as the connect-
ing puzzle, I think the club is likely
to bring a few success stories to our
mini version of the valley here quite
soon.
