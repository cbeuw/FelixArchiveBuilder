Further development of the new Im-
perial West campus in White City is
set to move forward following the re-
cent granting of planning permission
by local authorities. Zoe Mulholland,
programme manager for the project,
said that “she can conﬁrm that Ham-
mersmith and Fulham Council grant-
ed permission on 25 July 2012. due
to the scale and nature of the scheme
it was referred to the GLA [Greater
London Authority] for their approval
which was given on 20 September
2012.”
The site, at 80 Woods Lane, was
purchased by the College in 2009 for
£28m after former occupants BBC
Worldwide moved to the nearby Me-
dia Village. Located 500m away from
the Imperial Healthcare run Hammer-
smith Hospital the development will
aim to create facilities that will house
both world class research as well as
clinical teaching facilities for medi-
cal students. Planning permission for
postgraduate accommodation blocks
on the site had already been given in
2010. This is the ﬁrst phase of devel-
opment on the site, and has been com-
pleted. The Wood Lane Studios post-
graduate accommodation currently
houses the ﬁrst cohort of students.
This development nearly triples the
number of postgraduate bed spaces
that the College provides. Some one
third of the site has also been desig-
nated as being set aside for “commer-
cial activity” — this includes private
housing, a hotel and a “business incu-
bator” for start-up companies.
The planning permission allows Im-
perial to develop multiple buildings.
There will be over ﬁve new buildings,
three of which will be over ten stories
high. In total, to Felix’s current un-
derstanding, it seems that the total
amount of space will be just shy of one
million square feet.
The exact uses of all of the diﬀerent
buildings being built has not yet
