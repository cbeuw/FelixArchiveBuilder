Overall rankings
The Times
Most subjects such as Geology, Medi-
cine, Computer Science, Materials
and Biology have hovered around the
same ranking since 2011.
Other subjects have stayed consist-
ent in their ranking, like Civil Engi-
neering and Chemical Engineering in
2nd place, and Electronical and Elec-
trical Engineering in 4th place.
However some subjects, like Math-
ematics for instance, have suﬀered a
dramatic fall from 3rd to 7th place.
Chemistry had a slight improvement
from 18th up to 16th place.

The Times
Imperial’s student-staﬀ ratio scored
11.6 which is calculated on the Higher
Education Statistics Agency (HESA)
for 2010 -11. The Student Satisfaction
which includes academic support,
scored 78 and is based on the National
Student Survery.
Our Good Honours scored 81.7%
where this is the percentage of gradu-
ates getting a ﬁrst or upper second
class degree. But this could be due
good teaching, lenient marking to-
wards giving people better grades, or
our courses being easier.
