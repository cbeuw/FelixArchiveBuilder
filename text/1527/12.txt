an ‘Aspiration Nation’, and describing
aspiration as the engine for progress,
will have gone down well with
traditional conservative voters, but
his most quoted line has to have been
“I’m not here to defend privilege, but
to spread it”. It may be oxymoronic
to cite privilege as something that
can be spread, but voters always like
the notion that everyone
can get richer or more
successful.
The obedience of the
Conser vative
party from 2005
from the arrival of David
Cameron as their great
leader is faltering. MPs
are slowly speaking
out of turn
closing wards in one-ﬁfth of hospitals
and re-igniting the abortion debate
along with the Women’s Minister,
which is doing nothing to help the
coalition Government’s image of
being anti-women. Boris Johnson, in
a thinly veiled lurch for leadership,
is also posturing to keep a distance
between himself and Cameron, and
wrestling to take the media spotlight
away from Cameron. This was never
going to be an easy conference for the
Conservatives.
Of course this conference was by no
meansallnegativefortheConservative
party, despite the diﬃculties faced
in the rest of the political sphere –
Cameron is still the most liked of the
three main party leaders. The polls
must look distressing, but mid-term
of a government during a recession to
be only 10 points behind is something
to be not particularly worried about,
especially as Labour’s lead is mostly
caused by not being in the coalition
rather than through oﬀering a
preferable alternative.

Party conference – the political
equivalent of the oﬃce Christmas
party. Careers are made or broken;
too much alcohol and inappropriate
sex; and all the dirty secrets get out.
Thankfully much of that goes on
behind the scenes, because the novelty
of catching politicians with their
trousers round their ankles would
wear oﬀ pretty soon.
The media love to paint the
party conferences as a “make or
break” moment for the leaders of
parties, but this time they really
excelled themselves. Not only is the
economy still not growing, and with
unemployment especially among
young people a continuing problem,
Cameron’s party are going all out to
make the headlines and not necessarily
in the best way. The party’s Chief
Whip, Andrew “Bruiser” Mitchell,
was facing increasing pressure to
resign after shouting obscenities
at Downing Street police oﬃcers.
Jeremy Hunt, Health Secretary is
on issues they’re uncomfortable seeing
pushed, such as Zac Goldsmith on
Heathrow’s Third Runway, or Nadine
Dorries on everything. You can see the
push from all main parties to legalise
same-sex marriage is angering the
traditional Tory base. Lord Carey even
managed to compare those calling
opponents of equal marriage ‘bigots’
to Nazis. As Theresa May might have
said, “We’re the Nasty Party”, but one
of the major changes in the party
through Cameron’s leadership
was the shift towards more
liberal social policy, and the key
test to stand by this in tough
times has been passed
with almost ﬂying
colours. Fringe

r a l l i e s
a s i d e ,
the bulk
of the
p ar ty
remained in line during the
conference, especially on the issue of
same-sex marriage.
Those angered by the arrival of
policies such as equal marriage will
however have been well appeased
by the touting of the Government’s
latest policy – ‘Bash a Burglar’. To
steal a line from Tony Blair, “Tough
on crime, tough on the causes of
crime”, although I do not think that he
had more rights for homeowners to
attack those breaking into property in
mind. Many backbench Tory MPs are
unhappy with laws such as the Human
Rights Act, so making a play to reduce
the rights of criminals will do much to
keep the Conservative party united,
even when the Chief Whip is poised
on the edge of resignation.
With the conference season rounded
up, not much has changed. The
coalition is still intact, Labour are still
ahead in the polls, and the economy is
still the biggest problem. The troops
are rallied and each party is ﬁred up
to take the ﬁght to the others, it is just
a pity the next general election is not
until 2015.
Conservative Party Conference
The Republicans’ Last Chance to Win?
hroughout the campaign,
Obama has been depicted
as having two advantages:
the incumbent advantage
and the demographic advantage.
Since 1948, only three incumbent
presidents have failed to be re-elected,
with seven successful bids. As an
incumbent, the candidate has already
gone through the necessary amount
of selection to become president in
the ﬁrst place and has four years’
experience doing the job. At the
moment, with a dismal economy
and gridlocked administration
following the GOP takeover of the
House of Representatives, many
voters are disillusioned and even
disappointed with Obama,
reducing the momentum that
carried him to victory in 2008.
The demographic advantage,
however, is most certainly
playing its part in securing
electoral votes.
The American electorate
is changing, at an increasing
pace. The white proportion
of the electorate has been
declining since
1992. This
year, more
than
half the babies born in the country
were from minority parents, especially
Latinos. Every month, nearly 50 000
Latinos become eligible to vote. And
they tend to vote Democrat. Polls
have shown that a resounding 65-72%
of Latinos support Obama, with only
20–25% supporting Romney.
This change in demographics
has sent states swinging. Florida,
Colorado and Nevada have become
battlegrounds. New Mexico, where
almost half the population is Latino,
used to be viewed as a swing state
but since 2008 is almost considered
as a safe state for Democrats. And
this is only the beginning. Texas, and
its 38 electoral votes, has a growing
Latino population. The Republican
stronghold is now
being eyed by
Democrats.
The strong
lead Obama
holds within
the Latino
community
is rather
astonishing.
They are one
of the worst hit
groups by the
economic crisis
and Obama’s
administration
r e a c h e d
record numbers of deportations.
Higher unemployment than the
national average and the house price
crash, it is no surprise that the Latino
electorate is focused on economic
policies for this election. Even after
a rise in support in 2010 and Senator
Marco Rubio’s stardom, Romney and
the GOP have failed to take advantage
of the situation. The Republicans have
a strong and negative rhetoric on
border control and illegal immigrants
that alienates Latino voters. Romney’s
policies on a double layer border
fence with Mexico, “self deportation”
and an electronic system to verify
the legality of workers is not helping.
Latinos are not necessarily directly
concerned by these matters, however
they feel targeted. When Obama
declared in June that he would not
deport undocumented immigrants
who arrived in America as children
for two years, the deal was sealed.
The Republican Party is risking the
creation of an unfriendly political
identity within the Latino community.
The GOP’s second problem is the
youth. More than a third of GOP
voters are over 58. An Azimuth
Research Group poll has shown
that Republican voters aged 18-27
have diﬀerent priorities than older
members. Half of young voters ranked
government spending as their main
interest, compared to 36% older
voters. Unemployment and individual
liberty have similar scores for both
groups. The main other diﬀerence was
that younger voters showed little or
no interest in family, immigration and
the right to life. The Republican Party
may be out of touch with Latinos on
questions like immigration, they are
also out of touch with most Millenials,
the most liberal generation. GOP
membership is expected to decline
drastically over the next 20 years, with
a third of its members eﬀectively just
dying away. The GOP is on the brink
of a major demographic crisis. Its core
voter base, white, blue collar men,
will no longer be suﬃcient to win an
election. After 2012, the Republicans
will have to adapt their policies to
the new majorities and younger
generation, without whom they risk
political extinction. The Democrats
also need to provide more social and
economic opportunities for Latinos in
order to keep their support.
Concerning this coming election,
the die are still rolling. Romney
has the bad economy on his side.
Obama, even though he is backed by
an astounding majority of Latinos, is
playing a dangerous game, as their
voter turnout is not always high. And
completely random factors can still
aﬀect the race. A local college football
win could boost the incumbent’s
support by an average 1.6%.

BoJo and his mate, Dave the Broom
Americans are electing their president
butalso33Senators,athirdoftheSenate
and to an extent the keys to power.
The Senate has a strong role in the
American law making process. For an
act of Congress to pass, both the Senate
and the House of Representatives have
to approve it. Effectively, whichever
party controls the Senate will have a
strong hand in the policies that the
federal government attempts to launch.
The battle for the Senate has become
unexpectedly fierce and close, with
bothpartiesnowfightingforeveryseat.
Republicans were expected to do well
but most recent polls (realclearpolitics.
com)puttheDemocratsintheleadwith
48 seats, the GOP behind with 45 and
7 toss ups. The outcome of the election
is still very uncertain and it will depend
on the popularity of each presidential
candidate in the different states up for
election.Bothpartieswillalsobehoping
for a scandal free final campaigning
month, especially the Republicans.
Their candidate in Missouri, Todd Akin
has refused to step down even after the
outrage caused by his “legitimate rape”
comment. Winning the presidential
election without the Senate could
lead to a paralysed administration,
comparable to Obama’s, restricted by
the Republican controlled House of
Representatives.
