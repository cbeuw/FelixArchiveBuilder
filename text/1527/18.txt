Good news, bad news
Do you want the good news or the
bad news ﬁrst? The bad news is that
we are all hopeless optimists; but on
the positive side, research published
in PNAS last month suggests we can
be cured.
Previous research had shown that
we tend to process positive and nega-
tive information diﬀerently. When
updating our beliefs in response to
new intelligence, we react in the ra-
tional and expected way in response
to good news. However, when told
something we don’t want to hear, we
tend to discount it and fail to adjust
our beliefs and expectations accord-
ingly.
This so-called ‘good news/bad news
eﬀect’ is thought to contribute to the
human error that occurs in such di-
verse scenarios as medical decision-
making, responses to natural disas-
ters and ﬁnancial market bubbles.
Here the researchers used tran-
scranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
to disrupt the function of the infe-
rior frontal gyrus (IFG), the region
of the brain that previous studies had
shown to be implicated in the ‘good
news/bad news’ bias.
Participants were given descrip-
tions of ‘adverse life events’ and asked
to estimate how much at-risk they
personally felt in each case. Then they
were given information about the av-

In the UK, 820,000 people suﬀer with
dementia and by 2051 this ﬁgure may
rise to 1.7 million. The Foundation for
Science and Technology highlighted
this societal challenge by inviting four
speakers to talk about the issue from
unique perspectives.
The debate was started by Chief
Medical Oﬃcer, Professor Dame Sal-
ly Davies DBE FMedSci. She spoke
about the need to diagnose earlier: “If
it is picked up early, the drugs that are
available can extend good quality pe-
riod.” Only 31% of GPs feel they have
had suﬃcient training to diagnose de-
mentia.
She also argued that in order to rid
the stigma, all sectors of society must
understand. This is being done by the
Dementia Awareness Campaign as
part of the Prime Minister’s Demen-
tia Challenge strategy. “67% of peo-
ple with dementia said they suﬀered
loneliness, isolation, anxiety and de-
pression. One person talked about his
diﬃculties of getting his money out
the bank because he can’t remember
passwords and PIN numbers.”
The following speaker, Professor
Julienne Meyer, director of the My
Home Life programme at City Univer-
sity, develops action research and uses
it to improve care home qualities. She
works with the Government to carry
out its initiative of creating dementia
friendly communities involving those
who live, die, visit and work in homes.
“They are coming into care homes
at a point of crisis so I really welcome
opening up to volunteers to educate
the public to start thinking about their
own frailty and end of life.
“Society has turned its back on care
homes. We are ageist. We fear our
own end of life. We fear dementia.”
These social perspectives were com-
plemented with a speech from Profes-
sor James Goodwin, Head of Research
at Age UK.
Their Disconnected Mind project
has led to more understanding of the
biology of the disease. The project
found that genetic factors account for
24% of variation in change in cognitive
ability.
“We know what are the processes by
which we can move research into tan-
gible beneﬁts. The complex interac-
tion between researchers and users is
the rate-limiting step.” The researcher
may not reach out to the policy mak-
ers because they don’t trust policy
makers to utilise their research well,
and the practitioner may be sceptical
of the applicative potential of research
ﬁndings.
He also said that limitation also
comes under the form of funding,
where only 0.2% of R&D in the UK was
spent on dementia research in 2009.
The ﬁnal speaker was Jan Hall,
founder of the Evington Initiative
which raises money for dementia re-
search. She described how her family
were aﬀected by her mother’s illness.
This poignant speech concluded the
speakers’ debate and brought home
the necessity to tackle dementia.

Circuits you can just wash away
A well-known property of modern
silicon-based electronics is their re-
silience to change: a printed circuit
board (PCB) doesn’t dissolve, and only
melts at high temperatures. However,
following research recently published
in Science, this may no longer be the
case, with the production of a compli-
mentary metal-oxide semiconductor
(CMOS) that can physically disappear
at the end of use.
A set of materials, based on either
magnesium or silicon, dissolve af-
ter a certain period of time through
a chemical reaction where water can
pull the metal centres of the CMOS
structures, so forming a chemical
bond, which then results in the CMOS
being dissolved. This goes via a simple
chemical reaction:
Si + 4H2
O -> Si(OH)4
+ 2H2
.
The diﬀerence between this and
a traditional PCB is the way it is en-
cased: the dissolvable electronics are
enclosed within a silk structure, and it
is the structure of this silk that aﬀects
how well the circuit dissolves: circuits
have been formed which last from 10
minutes to nearly 12 days. This is all
thanks to changing how crystalline
the silk is. It is worth noting, however,
that the team reported success with
other biodegradable polymers.
Extreme conditions are also not re-
quired, with the structure successfully
dissolving at both body temperature
and room temperature, opening the
avenue for medical applications.
Trials of this technology in live or-
ganisms has already been undertaken,
with experiments on rats resulting in
huge success: three weeks after im-
plantation showed the structure hav-
ing almost fully dissolved, with only
faint residue of the original electron-
ics remaining. The circuit in question,
a set of two RF antennae connected to
heaters allowed the heat of the circuit
to be controlled via radio waves, to
great success: the circuit could be seen
in a thermal image when controlled.
This also worked when implanted be-
neath the skin.
This speciﬁc application is useful as
it shows how this technology can be
used to facilitate thermal therapy after
surgery to control infections.
The Illinois team, lead by John Rog-
ers is currently investigating full-scale
manufacture of the dissolvable sys-
tems through discussions with found-
ries. Additionally, potential circuits
are being devised for speciﬁc use cas-
es, with possibilities available in both
the medical and consumer markets.
Rogers has made the news in the
past for embedding circuits into life
forms, with a ﬂexible, implantable
LED array being announced in 2010,
and last year saw a temporary tattoo
containing electronic circuits, with
similar medical applications as this.

erage risks for their socio-economic
group.
The control group reacted as ex-
pected, failing to update their risk es-
timate in response to negative infor-
mation. But the participants who had
TMS applied to their IFG appeared to
have an enhanced ability to process
this information; the good news/bad
news eﬀect was abolished, and they
reassessed their risk correctly.
However, our tendency to focus on
the positive may have an evolution-
ary advantage: the ability to screen
out negative information in decision
making may have promoted the ex-
ploration and risk-taking that drove
our advancement as a species, and
may today function as a defensive
mechanism which protects our men-
tal health. We might be more rational
without it, but we might not be hap-
pier. That, we can probably agree,
would make for some pretty bad
news.
