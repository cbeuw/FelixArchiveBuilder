New term, new season and a
Lanvin
RED
Red has always held a special place in the hearts of wom-
en as a symbol of power, confidence and sensuality – an
eye-catching scarlet lipstick for seduction, chic red nails
for timeless elegance and, of course, scarlet-soled Lou-
boutins for a woman truly in control.
Red is a colour for turning heads, and always catches an
editor’s eye at fashion week. From rich reds with a metal-
lic sheen at Haider Ackermann and McQueen’s explosive
vermilion finale dress for the highest-impact, to the more
wearable versions – the little red dress is going to be the
dress for this party season. Don’t expect to stand on the
dancefloor with your back against the wall in the LRD.
Season after season, red crops up as the colour for the
brave and the confident. It stands alone, and requires no
distraction: heads turn with the smallest of efforts.

A more appetising name could have been found for this
colour – halfway between mahogany and dark red – cur-
rently taking the world by storm. Nevertheless, oxblood
is most definitely the colour to covet this season. Already
popular on the high street, this particular shade, reminis-
cent of a vintage red wine, took no time in filtering down
from the catwalks – and it’s not hard to see why.
Dark enough to hint at mystery but rich enough to utter
luxury; bright enough as a colour yet still deep enough for
winter, oxblood is the perfect colour. So perfect in fact,
that not only did Frida Giannini feature it on Gucci’s mod-
els, but also on the runway carpet, setting the scene for
her adventurous woodland-inspired show.
For all those wishing to blag their fashion credentials,
take note: oxblood is the colour to know.
From sugary grape to enchanting amethyst, purple was
the canvas colour for designers this autumn. In other
words, purple became the backdrop upon which patterns
were printed and embellishments sewn.
Purple has long been the colour of nobility and status,
so it is of little surprise to see the colour used to dye mink
and rich metallic tweeds – even a touch of the colour adds
something expensive and opulent to a look. Combine it
with black for a simple, chic ensemble.
For inspiration, refer to the different runway incarna-
tions of the colour: from Christopher Kane’s sweet and
youthful dress to Miu Miu’s luxurious deep purple suit –
see Karlie’s flash of turquoise across the eyes for an idea
for an extra pop of colour - purple and turquoise are a se-
cret match made in heaven.
