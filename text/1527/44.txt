Licenced to kill?
Despite my attempts to introduce new kinds of
puzzles that only I care about, your favourite num-
ber logic puzzle is here to stay.
Your goal is to make a single loop by joining the
dots so that numbered squares are surrounded by
the corresponding number of lines (e.g. a square
numbered ‘1’ can only have one line on one of its
sides).
As usual, send comments/complaints that the
puzzles are too hard/complaints that the puzzles
are too easy/complaints that the layout is an eye-
sore/solutions to puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

Four inhabitants of the island of Knights and Knaves (where Knights always tell the
truth and Knaves always lie) that know each other are shown two white hats and
three black hats. They stand in a line so that Andy can see Bob, Chris and Dan, Bob
can see Chris and Dan, Chris can see Dan, and Dan can see no-one. They each put on
one hat without looking at it, and they are asked what colour hat they’re wearing:
Andy: I don’t know.
Bob: Yes you do. I’m wearing a black hat, by the way. Hey Dan, you’re wearing black.
Chris: Hey, Andy’s not lying. I don’t know what I’m wearing either.
Dan: Yes you do. Come on, Andy’s a knave, for crying out loud.
What are they wearing? Who’s a knight and who’s a knave?
Solution to last week’s Knights and Knaves puzzle:
Andrew and Bartholomew are accusing each other of lying. That means that exactly
one of them is a knave. However, Curtis says that both of them are knaves. Thus, he’s
lying. Since he also accuses Andrew, Andrew is innocent. Since Andrew said he was
innocent, he’s a knight (and Bartholomew is a knave). Finally, Andrew says that both

clusion, none of the three men stole the horse.
