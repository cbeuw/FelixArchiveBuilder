GUILDS

The long awaited day finally came and as evening approached,
groups of merry supporters left Queens and made their way to the
coach assembly points. Just before 8 p.m. coaches started arriving
in the vicinity of Marshall Street Baths and disgorging masses of
bearded and be-scarved students, mostly of the engineering variety,
one of the R C S coaches forgetting to turn up, leaving a proportion
of R C S supporters at the mercy of London Transport.
Shortly after eight, the opposing factions sorted themselves out
into neat blocks in the spectators galleries of the baths, and after
rousing Boomalakas, Kangellas,
etc., started to join in a " what
are we waiting for " whereupon
the Captain of the Swimming
Club appeared and announced
the first race.
The individual races, spurred
on by vigorous cheering from
the sides of the baths, were soon
over, with Mines and Guilds level
at two first places each, R C S
with only one. These were fol-
lowed by the two team races
which were both won by Guilds.
Then came the highlight of the
eveningâ€”the Presidents' Race.
We had to wait a bit for this be-
cause the President of I C W A ap-
parently mislaid the top of her
Bikini, also there was some diffi-
culty in getting the Guilds Presi-
dent on to his air bed, and even
more difficulty in getting him to
stay on it. During the proceed-
ings various other persons also
managed to take the water in the
best Gala traditions. The race
was finally won by M r . Chand-
mal, who swam a smooth and re-
laxed crawl to pip the I C W A
President, encumbered with a
I'obted candle, to the post. Chris
Liddle finally had to be pulled
across the baths with a piece of
string, otherwise it was feared
that he would never arrive. By
means of this subterfuge, he even
managed to beat Mike Harris to
the finish.
The water Polo was next, but
after the first two matches, atten-
tion swung to what had once been
a shapely hat, but was now just a
missile for throwing across the
baths. Here R C S definitely had
the up,-er hand, in the form of
Dave Dean, the Guilds throws
falling persistently short.
After the last match. Guilds
were declared the overall winners,
and the President of I C W A
handed out the prizes. A t this
point, the Swimming Captain
mentioned that unfortunately the
Warden of U L U was not with us.
but to make up for it, the U L U
Pool had provided us with a
prize for the winner of the Presi-
dents' race. The horrified Presi-
dent of IC discovered that he
had been handed a handsome
polished sisn from a certain
swimming baths in the imme-
diate vicinitv of Malet Street.
The evening was finally term-
minat^d with a rowdy session in
the I C bar.
Selwyn Lloyd at LC.
The Main Physics Lecture
Theatre was filled almost to
bursting last Tuesday for the
General Studies Lecture by ex-
Chancellor of the Exchequer
Selwyn Lloyd, M . P . Discussing
" The Current Political Situa-
tion," he said that, in view of
the " horrible alternatives," it
was vital that the Conservative
Party win the next General
Election. In defence of this
statement later, he said that both
the opposition parties were pro-
mising vast increases in Govern-
ment spending, apparently with-
out any increase in taxation.
Such a policy could only lead to
disastrous inflation, the very
thing he had striven to avoid
whilst Chancellor. Describing in
some detail the reasons behind
some of the actions he took as
D . Bourne
Chancellor, he gave a fascinating
insight into the intricacies of the
task.
Internationally, the economic
trends are against Britain; the
ruwly-developing countries are
beginning to provide for them-
selves the services formerly sup-
plied by us, and the balance of
power is shifting inevitably to
the larger economic blocs. For
this reason alone, it is very much
in our interests to become a part
of the E.E.C. However, on the
question Of a Federal System of
Government for Europe, he said
this would have to be considered
separately. He doubted if it
would come " within our life-
time."
After a confused piece of rhet-
oric from Frank Fuchs was
speedily cut short by the chair-
man, M r . Lloyd dealt very
quickly with a large range of
topics. He was quite willing to
comment on his recent dismissal
from the cabinet ; he spiritedly
defended the right of the Premier
to make any changes in the team
he wanted to. A statement which
was warmly applauded. Asked
whether he did not think the time
had come for a change of cap-
tain, he just smiled.
At the end of the questioning,
he was thanked for giving the
College a part of his very full
day. " O h , " he replied, with a
rueful grin, " I am not as busy
now as I used to be."
