Editorial
No doubt, regular readers will be wondering what happened
to our eight pages this week. Unfortunately there was a shortage
of advertising for a sixth issue this term, and as F E L I X is now
run on " pay your way " lines, it was though that it would be
necessary to forego the Christmas, end of term, edition. However,
in view of the large number of events taking place in the last two
weeks, and the small surplus which we have managed to build up
over the term, it was finally decided to bring out a six page issue,
this giving approximately the same amount of articles and news as
does an eight page issue with advertising. Those who consider
themselves grossly overcharged should remember that the last issue
was also sold at 4d. despite the fact that it had ten pages.
It is never too early for advance notices, and the one that
the Editor would like to make in this column is that the first issue
next term- Will be on sale on January 16th, just before the Union
meeting. Copy day for this issue will be January 9th and 10th. Con-
tributors who want to submit articles at the last minute should try
and get them typewritten, as this improves their chances of acceptance.
The Editor would also like to take this opportunity to wish all
readers a Merry Christmas, and to thank all his regular staff and
occasional contributors for the support-and encouragement which has
made this term's F E L I C E S possible. It is to be hoped that examina-
tion fever will not remove all of them next term.

storage space is a bit short in the

not be left lying about where they

This Christmas edition of
F E L I X comes to you without
any advertisements, which means
that it is going to lose money,
The Editor assures me that this
state of affairs is temporary and
it is not necessary to send cheques

financial difficulties. It is hoped
that the absence of ads. about
careers will not worry anybody
unduly over the vac. If it does,
the the solution is to take a free
copy of "Graduate Careers" from
the pile in the Union Entrance
Hall. This is an excellent maga-
zine which is worth reading even
by those who aren't worried
about a career. The pity is that
no system of distribution has
been organised with the result
that the piles Of this magazine
are at the moment littering the
Union.
While on the subject of litter
in the Union, I could well com-
ment on the rubbish which is
cluttering up the place this term
— particularly in the Upper
Lounge, table tennis room, gym,,
back stairs, etc. Most of the
junk is the binroduet of the Car-
nival, Smoking Concert and
iDrama Soc. activities. Adding to
the general mess are pieces of
eyesore.
The present state of the gym
nasium is a disgrace to the Col-
lege. The ceiling has been badly
damaged and the floor has not
benefited from hvaing Carnival
flats dragged across it and
weights dropped on it. The ceil-
ings damage is especially disturb-
ing as it is obviously caused by
irresponsible vandals who seem
to take delight in damaging pro-
perty not belonging to them per-
sonally. The same attitude is dis-
played by the hoodlums who
walk on the grass in the quad.
Admittedly the turf wil lnever b
good enough for croquet, but it
would at least look presentable if
given a chance, and if it was not
trampled on after wet weather
The Union cannot afford to spend
large sums to make good the
damage made by irresponsible
members, but it really should not
have to. Next time that vou are
walking across the grass, kicking
a ball at the gvm ceiling, or just
breaking a chair in the refectory
just think . . .

Dear Sir,
However necessary for admin-
istration, the division of l.C.
Clubs into three groups has dis-
advantages. Not least among
these is the inference that the
members of the College are di-
vided into " Social" or " Sport-
ing " types with conflict of in-
terests tacitly assumed. The cari-
catures of beer swilling empty-
headed sportsmen and hair split-
ting, anaemic gas-bags are not to
be taken as photographs. College
Christian groups have fielded
their own soccer teams and the
Rugger club offers more social
life than many social clubs.
Membership of social and athletic
clubs is no contradiction in
terms; indeed it is, I would sub-
mit, an ideal often realised.
It is for this reason that 1 object
most strongly to the suggestion
that the N.U.S. issue is to be dis-
cussed in terms of social v. ath-
letic clubs. I was sorry that this
was done in the last issue of Felix
in an article which creates the
danger that this debate will de-
velop into a slanging match.
Phrases such as " crude illogical
nonsensical rubbish," " raising
fanatical instincts," and refer-
ences to a student body whose
membership is so vast as a
" National Aquarium of little
fish in too deep water " are a dis-
grace to their author, your paper
and to the reasonable discussion
of any objections of the college to
joining N.U.S.
Yours sincerely,
GEORGE TURNER.
Dear Sir,
The appearance of an article in
Felix against joining N.U.S.
seems to have dropped like a
bomb in the pro N.U.S. camp—
comments have ranged from " re-
sign " to " disgrace to their au-
thor." However, if half the in-
terest is picked up by all Union
members then we are guaranteed
a representative opinion on this
issue at the next Union meeting—
the aim of the President and my-
self. I regret that Mr. Turner
feels bitter at my methods, but as
a debater I feel sure that he will
agree that the rules of persuasion,
whether to fill a Union meeting or
to carry a motion, are a trifle
different to those of the Rugby
field.
With regard to splitting the
Union, this is the last thing that
I would advocate. But if we join
N.U.S. the finance must come
from somewhere. The proposers
of the motion are well aware that
we will be unable to finance it
from reserves as they anticipated
and in this case I feel that the
people who are going to be re-
stricted to a certian extent by lack
offinance,i.e., the Athletic Clubs,
from whom the majority of the
money may be eventually nibbled,
should be well aware of this fact.

Dear Sir,
It is perhaps unfortunate that
the vote was nearly equal, for the
inevitable seisms are now appear-
ing. The insidious demands for
reversals strike at the very heart
of the Union directive apparatus.
If we are to do as Mr. Dauman
bids, we are going to open the
door to the " stab in the back "
politics of the Ceasars, where rea-
son gave way to hysterical emo-
tion.
Speaking as a supporter of
mental health, I would urge all
thinking members of the Union to
support a motion passed at the
last meeting.
Yours sincerely,
J. H. McKERROW, C&G.
Dear Sir,
It is a sad, but true fact, that
although the Arabian National
Anthem was played, in full, at the
start of the Cabaret for the
Guilds-Mines Carnival, not one
person stood up. Does this fur-
ther reflect the apathy existing in
i.e.?
Yours faithfully,
D. G. BISHOP.
.(For those who wish to pin-
point the place where the Anthem
was played. Cast your mind
back to the 30-second fanfare
which preceded the first singing
group—the Bakewell Tarts. This
30-sepond fanfare was the Na-
tional Anthem in question.—
D.G.B.)

Union Meeting on January
tifeth.
A motion will be put before
the house by Bob Finch " That
we should join N U S forthwith."
In view of the fact that this a
matter which has been on the
minds of many people for almost
the whole term, a turn out of
about 1.000 is expected, and it is
hoped to hire the Royal Geo-
graphic Hall for the occasion.
