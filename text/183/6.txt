Swimming Gala
Despite the loss of last year's top swimmers, spectators were left
in no doubt as to the strength of I C swimming and water polo teams.
The individual events were far from one-sided, Guilds and Mines
each gaining two firsts, whilst R C S had one. Davies (Mines) and
Hennessy (Guilds) were impressive in the butterfly and the backstroke
respectively, while the breaststroke proved to be the closest race, the
three competitors all finishing within one second of each other. In
the team races, however, Guilds undoubtedly proved their superiority.
In the water polo, Guilds with
five IC first team members should W A T E R P O L O
have overwhelmed R C S in the
first match, but in the first half I C R E A C H F I N A L S

R E P L A Y v C E M this Wednesday
The members of the Swimm-

at present id l . C . , would like to
thank everyone concerned for
making their visit a success.
Unfortunately, two of the vis-

A buzz of excitement went round a rather room in U . L . U . last
March when the 1st Round of the U . L . Cup was announced. The
first balls out of the bag indicated Q.M.C. v. I.C., the two finalists
in the 1962 competition. It was rumoured then that the winners
of this match would win the Cup. The final result remains to be
seen, but after two hard games I.C. are through into the 2nd Round
versus Goldsmiths' in January.
Guys Hospital lost 3-2
University College won 4-1
Thiaterm won 11, lost 1
from the cloakroom — a return 2 n d t e a m w o n 5 l o s t g
of these would be appreciated.
Playing in disgusting weather
at Brentwood, I.C. were forced to
replay at Harlington on Sat.,
Dec. 1st. Under perfect condi-
tions and urged on by seven
megaphoned supporters, the Cup-
holders started well. Their wing-
halves (Austin and Huxtable)
took control of the centre of the
field and with the full-backs keep-
ing tight on their wing-men,
James strong again at centre-half
the Q.M.C. forward line was
given little room in which to
move.
On the large pitch I.C. endea-
voured to attack on a broad
front, but time and again this
plan broke down when a cross
from one of the wingers was
headed harmlessly to Q.M.C.'s
very efficient goalkeeper. Occa-
sionally the Q.M.C. forward line
broke loose, their centre-forward
twice shooting just wide. These
bursts were short-lived, however,
when misfortune struck the visi-
tors twice in ten minutes. The
centre-half went limping on to the
left wing, and the right-half was
carried off, injured in the fierce
tackling which is a feature of all
cup-ties.
Reduced to ten men, Q.M.C.
were driven still further back into
their own half but with a well
organised defence they managed
to survive several onslaughts
from I.C. The hitter's defence
watched in frustration as their
colleagues came so near to finish-
ins the approach to goal. Twenty
minutes from full-time Fisher
went u o to head across from the
left. The referee awarded a
oenalty to T.C. for a push in the
back and Fisher drove the ball
low into the net. Q.M.C. fouaht
hard for the equaliser but with
ten men the pace of the game
began to tell and I.C., rather
luckily are one step nearer to the
U.L. Cup for the fifth successive
year.

club is that, while there are
The main difficulty of this
usually an adequate number of
freshers joining the club each
year, very few of these have had
any fencing experience. A s it
takes at least two years for the
average person to reach a fair
proficiency in free play, it means
that just as they would be useful
team members they are leaving
college. This year has proved no
exception, with only two or three
new members with previous
match experience. Club meetings
have however been much better
attended than in recent years and
one hopes that this improvement
will continue.
In inter college matches we
have won two and lost two, beat-
ing Chelsea and Battersea, and
losins to Guy's Hospital and
Q.M.C.
We have again entered the
newly formed London A . F . A .
Men's League although so far
without success, having lost all
three matches so far fenced. The
standard of the teams in these
malrhes tends to be definitely
higher than that of the average
college team, and in the recent
match against Thames F . C . in-
cluded one fencer recently re-
turned from the Commonwealth
Games in Perth.
