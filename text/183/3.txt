FELIX 3 -
NUS - Yes or no
T.D.P., otherwise my friend John Preece, had some fairly out-
spoken things to say in the last issue of F E L I X about the prospect
of Imperial College affiliating to the National Union of Students.
No one that I know of, among the many in this college who
have voiced their support for our entry into N.U.S., has ever seriously
put forward refectory improvements as one of the benefits of member-
ship. Yet on the serength of one overheard remasfa to this effect
by a person unknown, M r . Preece was prepared to dismiss all our
arguments as " crude, illogical, nonsensical rubbish," and to accuse us
of attempting to "raise the ardour of the ordinary Union member
to a feverish pitch." M r . Preece should take care that he does not
qualify for his own descriptions, because, as he well knows, we have
been determined all along that this important issue should be judged
fairly on the facts, and we intend to present to the Union meeting
next term what we believe to be
an overwhelming factual case for
ceasing to be the only major col-
lege in the whole of Great Britain
remaining outside N.U.S. Let us
have no more of these wild ac-
cusations ; who ever heard of
Bob Finch " rousing fanatical in-
stincts "?
Mr. Preece objects to paying'
the expenses of the delegates who
will attend the bi-annual con-
ference of the National Union.
But surely these delegates will
not, as he seems to think, be in-
dulging in a private political holi-
day ; they will be doing a very
demanding job of representation,
on behalf of everyone in the Col-
lege. This Union pays the full
amount of M r . Preece's Hall ac-
commodation charge because we
all think M r . Preece does a good
job (in most case) as our elected
representative, and it is also pay-
ing for M r . Preece to go on a
soccer tour to Paris because we
think he is going to represent us
well there too ; surely then it is
being a bit selfish for him to turn
round and deny our N.U.S. repre-
sentatives their expenses ?
What expenses the delegates
are eventually given will depend
on the Council of this Union,
but they are unlikely to be more
than travelling expenses. To give
seven delegates their return rail
fare twice a year at, say. £4 per
head for an average journey, will
amount to less than £60, not £200
as M r . Preece quotes. With the
£180 affiliation fee (1/3 per Union
member) this make about £240 in
all, not £400. Even allowing for
such eventualities as an increase
in the number of I.C. students,
it is unlikely that N.U.S. will cost
us more than £300 per annum.
Where is the money going to
come from ? Well, in the first
place it will not be demanded
from the college this academic
year, for if we decide to join in
January our membership will not
take effect until November. A s
next year's budget is as yet un-
prepared, it is perfectly possible,
if members of this Union so de-
sire, for an allowance to be made
for a meagre £300 in a total of
some £13,000. On the other
hand the budget is likely to be a
pretty tight one, judging by this
year's demands, and it is not the
intention of those who, like my-
self, are in favour of our joining,
that other legitimate require-
ments be refused because of our
affiliation. The long-term an-
swer lies in the raising of Union
fees, which is going to be neces-
sary anyway, N.U.S. or no
N.U.S.; until this can be done an
interim solution will have to be
found, either by cutting our in-
vestments or drawing on our re-
serves. Nobody likes drawing on
reserves, but it is the policy of
the Union to do this when it con-
siders it really necessary. We
have recently given £5,000 of our
reserve fund towards a new
sports centre because we think a
sports centre is a jolly good
thing ; in the same way we can
give a much smaller sum to
N.U.S. for a short period if we
think that N.U.S. is a good thing
too.
Apart from the considerable
concessions we will get from
membership, I think it is about
time we in this college pulled
our weight in national student
affairs and did our bit generally
for students in this country. Let
us hope that after January we
shall no longer be the equivalent
of the Flat Earth Society in the
student world.
DEBATE QUARTER-FINAL
In the quarter final of the U L U
Debating competition, IC pro-
posed the motion that " This
house considers Nationalism out
of date." The opposers were a
team from L S E . Proposing the
motion, Bob Finch, for IC, began
by saying that pride in one's
country was far from a bad
thing but said that his thesis was
that a fanatical " my country
right or wrong " attitude is both
a potential source of evil and an
idea which has little relevance in
the world to-day. War was a
constant danger where nation-
alism existed and some form of
supranationalism was necessary
to ensure peace.
Trevor Fish, opening for L S E ,
said that the proposer had failed
to tackle the real problem of
whether nationalism existed to-
day and whether it had shown
any results. The old form of
nationalism was dying out, but
the nationalism in the new de-
veloping countries was playing a
vital part in their advancement,
which was an essential factor in
the stability of the world situa-
tion.
George Turner, for IC, made
the point that the L S E team were
talking about entirely different
things. IC was proposing that
nationalism was out of date, not
that it did not exist. The follow-
ing L S E speakers did nothing to
rectify this, the debate bagging
down on the different interpre-
tations of the motion. Don Pear-
son repeated that just because
nationalism was still with us. did
not mean that it was not out of
date. Tom Evans in his summing
Guilds-Mines Carnival
SH(R)IEKS O F D E L I G H T
The price of black market
tickets was high, fancy dress was
frantically being searched out or
stitched together, last minute
partners were being procured(?).
Yes, the Guilds-Mines Carnival
was upon us.
We arrived at about 10 p.m.,
thinking that we would be among
the first arrivals, only to find that
almost everyone had already
beaten us to it.
Even before we had time to
have a few drinks, a few dances,
and observe the many well
shaped women in varying stages
of fancy undress, it was feeding
time (shishkebab, and very nice
too). With appetites satisfied,
we wandered back to the Concert
Hall, which looked more like a
cross between Arabia and the in-
side of a cave, with overtones of
whales and genies, and found that
the Clyde Valley Stampers were
providing that extra vitality
needed to prevent the floor be-
coming covered with a mass of
prostrate bodies.
Raja Liddle rampaging kept
everyone amused, even though
his sword did tend to cause pain-
ful embarrassment to some
people. The Raja showed him-
self to be an excellent, swords-
man, fighting a mock duel with
the President of Mines, who
looked like a typical beggar from
the Middle Ages in his sackcloth
and leopard skin trunks. Sparks
flew and so did spectators.
The cabaret, as is customary,
provided rest and laughter and
we were all suitably impressed
when it finished. After this,
things got a bit drowsy, though
most of us remember Satchmo
and High Society. Somewhere
around 6 a.m. the party broke
up, we mounted our camels and
rode off into the sunrise of the
new day.
The next afternoon, we all
agreed that Jimmy Marshall and
Pete Griffiths and their crews had
done a great job. The theme of
the Carnival gave plenty of scope
for fancy dress, and the entertain-
ment throughout the evening was
first class.
" Hey, where's my partner
gone ?"
" Saw her go that way with a
big . . ."
Who'sfe) B E D - O U - I N ?
P.S.—Pete and Jimmy wish to
thank all those who he'ped to
make the Carnival the success it
was.
up for L S E repeated that the op-
position had taken a reasonable
interpretation of the motion, and
had shown that it should be re-
jected.
Asit Chanmal then gave a fact-
packed, high-speed summary of
the arguments for the motion,
prefacing his remarks with an ob-
servatio n that the opposition re-
minded him of Jane Austen—
much Pride and Prejudice with
little Sense or Sensibility. He
concluded by saying that the
motion had been shown to be
true.
Mr. David Bouger, the pre-
siding judge, then delivered the
summing up and the verdict. He
went into some detail about the
speeches and found L S E superior
on all counts, 219 points to 197.
It is difficult to reconcile this
with the actual debate. L S E un-
doubtedly scored high on elo-
quence, particularly in the case
of Alan Seal, but " the duty of
the opposition is to adapt itself
to the arguments presented by
the proposition. The team op-
posing the motion are responsible
for seeing that a clash develops,
and it is a serious weakness in
their case if they fail to do so."
( U L U Handbook on the Debat-
ing Competition.) This L S E
never attempted to do, no clash
developed, and it was hard to see
how they could have won. Mr.
Bouger seemed far too keen to
justify his decision in what, after
all, was a very close debate. His
show of personal friendship with
the L S E men did not go down
too well, either.
However, this must not detract
from the high standard of the
L S E team, which must now stand
a very good chance of winning
the competition again this year.
G U I L D S P R E S I D E N T HORS
D E C O M B A T
(By our special correspondent)
Contrary to popular belief, and
to the opinion expressed in the
article on the Carnival (guess
who wrote it), the President of
Guilds did not distinguish him-
self with his swordplay on the
night. According to well-in-
formed sources, a minor differ-
ence between the two Presidents
led to a mock duel, in the North-
east corner of the Beit quad.
This was proceeding reasonably,
smoothly with the Guilds Presi-
dent demonstrating certain finer
points of fencing to the Mines
President. When this gentleman
decided to try a few of them
h'tnself. the defensive tactics of
the Raja proved insufficient, with
the result that he was " hors de
combat " with a sword hand that
was slightly the worse for wear.
This and the imminent closing
of the bar brought the duel to a
close. Some time later, the Presi-
dent of Mines was heard to mut-
ter, " it was all a big mistake--
we are just good friends."
