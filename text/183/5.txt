I.C. Dramatic from p.4
creaky affair had many extremely
funny moments. Judy Lewis and
Carol Melville as the mother and
daughter of dubious social stand-
ing making a frontal assault on
the establishment had a successful
time o f it, even though Carol's
part must have been very trying
—she is always on the verge of
releasing some emotion when
Anouilh puts his foot in the
flood gates. Andrew Page played
the part of the butler with quiet
distinction, while Chris Master-
man raged and moaned bril-
liantly as a somewhat youthful
millionaire. Carolle Lovell,
Brenda Chant and H . Strasse
competed a well drilled and com-
petent cast.
One or two aspects of the pro-
duction, it must be said, seemed
to get a little out of joint. A c -
cording to the programme, no-
body was responsible for the
music, and this was all too ap-
parent. We had what sounded
like a random selection from
Dancing Class stock which
made it rather difficult to con-
jure up the picture of an elegant
society ball twirling and twidd-
ling just off stage. A little pre-
cious magic was lost here. The
lighting crew seemed to have
their own ideas of when a scene
should start, which did not
always coincide with the activity
on the stage. Again, although
lines were delivered confidently
without any recourse to a
prompter, they were by no means
always the lines in my copy of
the play, and some hair-raising
omissions and contractions took
place.
The Society are nevertheless
to be cnogratulated on a very im-
pressive effort at an extremely
difficult play. This certainly
augurs well for the IC bid to re-
tain the Clee Cup in the next U L
Competition.

" It's clean this year," was the
rallying cry of this year's Smok-
ing Concert, in place of the
'Cor B r of two years ago.
" Culture for the masses, whether
they like it or not" was the
theme of Chris Tye's compering,
and although there was not much
culture, there was not much
bawdy obscenity. There was no
great surfeit of top talent, either,
the free beer tending to make up
for this.
The acts in the first half were
a little slow, with a few excep-
tions. This year saw the first
performance of the Shadies,
an R C S Big Beat group with a
good line in amplified guitars,
and a supporting vocal group
which have obviously been gen-
ning up on the latest in back-
ground "ooh-aahs," to good
effect. Norman Price, complete
with a fine pair of snake hips,
did the solo vocal, with a full
spectrum of agonised expressions
in the best E P style.
" Latrinus Publicus " and " Dr.
N o " went down quite well,
though the jokes seemed a little
stereotvped. It is always a bit
of a shock to see familiar faces
in a strange rig-out and just the
appearance of the Roman Sena-
tors in their white togas was good
enough for a long laugh. Among
the solo acts, Simon Adlam on
the ladder and Mike King on the
pneumatic drill, were excellent,
the other acts missing out some-
what by their use of the stage
microphone amplifying system
which has never been too good,
and certainly could not cope with
a noisy audience.
The second half saw a more
alive audience (rowdier) and
several good acts, among them
" T h e Dales" and "To-night,"
which included a song sung by
a kilt-clad Welshman, Emlyn
Jones, who appeared to one of
the most unmusical people. The
highlights of this half again were
the musical ones, the talking
blues of Dick Smith and the re-
appearance of the Shadies with
their show stopper " Guildsman
in J a i l " :
They've got the Spanner,
It's too big to loose,
But its B — y useless
Like all Guildsmen's tools . . .
etc.,(to the tune of "Teenager
in Love ").
A l l in all, a good effort by
Bryan Hooper and Kish to cut
down filth while keeping up in-
terest. A s for the Shadies, they
could well provide some occa-
sional beat music for the less far
would certainly be a pitv if thev
out cats at College Hops—it
disappeared from the scene, after
the success they enjoyed at the
Smoking Concert.

During this week, Carol
Singing is being organized every
evening. Last year singers from
the College collected over £300;
whether it was given out of grati-
tude or desperation is far from
clear ; and this year it is hoped
to double that total. So come
along one evening ; if your sing-
ing is not all that hot, it doesn't
really matter, volume is more im-
portant that quality, and if you
just haven't got a voice at a l l ;
well, somebody's got to rattle the
tin !

This term has seen the introduction of the new constitution
inaugurated by the McPherson regime. The size of the general com-
mittee has been reduced by having only one representative per depart-
ment, instead of reps for each undergraduate year and one for post-
graduates in the big departments like Physics or Maths. This reduc-
tion has been accompanied by a rise in efficiency, though the success
of the present system is dependent on close contact between the
department rep. and the appropriate year reps. This year, this
appears to have been achieved.
At the beginning of the term,
the Clubs Committee elected
Fred Dobner as its new Chair-
man. Although most of the
clubs received a reduced grant,
most of them have been fairly
active, with the exception of the
Chemical Society, which this
year has been a pale shadow of
its former self.
The Entertaintainments Com-
mittee has run one excellent
Saturday Dance and successfully
produced the Smoking Concert
(see other pages), and is now at
work on next term's Carnival, to
be held on Friday, 8th March,
and has even started on ideas for
the Summer Ball. Anyone with
ideas for these events should
contact the Committee. Inci-
dentally the name of any R C S
rep. can be found in the R C S
directory on the departmental
notice boards.

This year there were four din-
ners. The ladies were present at
the last two. Wine was served
at all the dinners and in conse-
quence they tended to be quieter
and more sober than the beer
dinners of the other Colleges.
After the last two dinners, a bar
was set up in the T V lounge so
that the men could get together
with the lady freshers over a
drink. This brought forth pro-
tests from the hardened boozers
because the number of singers in
the bar was much diminished.
This year there was a severe
shortage of second year hosts be-
cause of the very large number
of freshers, but some public
spirited third year men volun-
tered to act as hosts for the
second time and most of the
freshers were entertained. The
few . freshers who were not ac-
companied had a free dinner on
the Union.
On November 2nd a reception
was held for postgraduate
freshers to enable them to meet
each other, and some members of
staff. About 50 per cent, timed
up, and i t is hoped to hold regu-
lar postgraduate evenings in
future.

0 There have been two Union
Meetings this term. A t the first,
there were elections of year reps.,
Queen of Jezebel, and a second
Trophy Officer was elected. The
second meeting \yas a sports meet-
ing at which the Trophy Officers
were tried for the loss of Theta.
T H E T H E T A A F F A I R
Theta was stolen from the in-
side of a wardrobe in a locked
room in the New Hostel after
the third Freshers' Dinner
Clues subsequently sent from an
anonymous engineering College
in Exhibition Road led to the
Caltex Oil offices in London, the
Blundell's Arms in Horwich, the
City Arms in Billingham, and
Wankie Colliery in Southern
Rhodesia. To save delay in
waiting for a reply from the Dark
Continent, the President of Guilds
invited the President of R C S to
perform a forfeit in front of the
Guilds Union Meeting. After
Mr. Harris had sung and danced
to the satisfaction of the en-
gineers, Theta was returned to
RCS and is now in safe keeping.

On the last Friday of Novem-
ber R C S entertained the Maths,
and Phys. Soc. of Birmingham
University at Harlington. R C S
turned out " sport" teams, but
Birmingham had other ideas,
with the result that although we
won at Soccer 8—2, the Rugby
team lost 3—21. On the same
evening, two coach loads of R C S
supporters went to Marshall
Street Baths to see their team
finish last.
E X C U R S I O N S
It is hoped next term to have
an R C S excursion, to take the
form of an afternoon of sport-
ing activities with a sport even-
ing. A return trip to Birming-
ham would be ideal for a return
match. A n evening outing to the
Windmill has also been sug-
gested. The whole matter is now
in the hands of a special sub-
committee, and anyone with
ideas should contact Norman
Price of Physics II.
