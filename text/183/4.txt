UNION MEETING
The last Guilds Union Meeting was held on the 30th November
in room 542 E l building. The minutes of the last meeting were
read out, and duly acclaimed by all present, including in the newly
broken-in freshers.
The President then displayed a long thin red and white object,
known to some, we believe, as Theta. That we still have it is due
abouts. It was therefore decided to give it back to its owners on
mainly to the inability of R C S to solve the clues as to its where-
the condition that one Mr. Harrys paid a forfeit. So, heralded by
a bright flash (and subsequent smog) he appeared resplendent in
what looked like a corduroy dressing gown. Prompted by M r . Liddle,
and to the wavering accompaniment of the latest oriental hit, he
danced somewhat unimaginatively to and fro along the bench.
This was not enough for one sec-
tion of Guildsmen, whose thirst
for a garment worn usually by
males around the lower part of
the body bordered on the inde-
cent. To placate these panta-
loonatics. he sang one verse of a
somewhat bawdy song believed
to have originated in the Rural
College of Signs. Having tired of
this Christian, the two top lions
escorted him and the mascot from
the meeting to the strains of the
funeral march from Salad Days.^
There were two correspondents
-•Lord Rayon and Spud. The
first letter was read out by John
White standing in the sink. At-
tempts to make him grow larger
by watering his feet were dis-
couraged by simple yet effective
means. Spud's letter was in the
nature of a challenge as he pro-
posed that Guilds and Mines
should have a friendly competi-
tion in the Union Bar after the
Swimming Gala. The challenge
was accepted and an account of
the Swimming Gala can be found
elsewhere in this issue.
Somewhere in the course of
the proceedings, a new society,
the Contact Bridge Club, was
proposed. The proposer gave a
summary of the less intricate
rules of the game, punctuated
with laughter. One of your cor-
respondents did not see the joke,
the other one curled up on the
floor making peculiar gurgling
noises.
The Boat Club Captain toasted
himself for the Morphy Day suc-
cesses, the gathering singing
" F o r he's a jolly good fellow,"
at somewhere near a quarter
tempo.
Pete Griffiths then put in some
plugs for the Engineers' Dinner
Dance, and received thanks for
his organisation of the Carnival.
The Meeting was finally closed
with a B O O M A L A K A . Owing
to the injury of his finger, the
President excused himself from
holding up the Spanner, thus
keeping up his record of not hav-
ing done a complete Boomalaka
this session. With commendable
humanity, thes members shouted
down M r . White's offer to act as
substitute, and elected M r .
Klaschka as Spanner holder (he
being the smallest members of the
Executive), which dutv he per-
formed efficiently, albiet two-
handedly.

Sir Harold Roxy Cox has
kindly accepted the invitation to
be the principal guest at this
year's dinner on January 25th.
R I N G A R O U N D T H E M O O N
The I C Dramatic Society's
Christmas production of " Ring
Around the M o o n " by Anouilh
was given four performances last
week. Translated from the
French by Christopher Fry, this
is in the unfamiliar idiom of the
" comedia del'arte" which can
be described as a charade with-
out music. • In a charade, no
strong emotions are aroused, no
formal ideas are developed and
no specific causes embraced.
Success or failure depends criti-
cally on the sheer personality and
acting ability of the group, which
has to solve questions of rhythm
and balance without which the
magic collapses and all that is
left is a string of small talk.
Bryan Hooper, the President of
the Drama Soc., paying the
tricky double part, had a smooth
evening; perhaps Frederick
could have had a little more
warmth, but Hugo had plenty of
cynical icy glitter. Jenny Des-
mond as the aunt gave a very fine
performance indeed, avoiding the
pitfall of being merely crotchety.
She has excellent stage presence
and a particularly good musical
diction. Anne and Dick Saun-
