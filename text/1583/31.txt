The
force
behind
Freshers’ Fair
B: What clubs and societies are you
currently involved in or have you
been a member of?
A: Last year I was in Muay Thai,
Karate, Ju-Jitsu, Sinfonietta Orchestra
and I used to be involved in the 2
clubs my friends were setting up:
Comedy and North American society.
B: Did you always want to
become a Sabbatical officer?
A: Well, I’ve only been at Imperial 2
years, so it wasn’t like a long-running
thing. It wasn’t something I came to
university to do… But being largely
involved in clubs, it was definitely
something that I started wanting to
do towards the end of first year.
B: Did you consider Deputy of
Clubs and Societies to help clubs
run smoothly?
A: Yeah, I just really enjoyed having
support from the Union, and I
wanted to be a part of that.
B: Is there anything you want to
change?
A: I want to try and make
everything run as smoothly as
possible, to make sure everything is
working. To make sure people who
are running a society for the first
time know what they are doing.
The other thing is to look at the
management group structure and
see how we can make that work
potentially a bit better. It clearly does
work, but it can maybe be improved.
B: On the issue of accountability,
Chris mentioned having a student
vote to decide if each Sabb has
done a good enough job. Do you
think with the work of Deputy
Clubs and Societies, the work
you do is directly visible to the
students, ie: if all societies run
smoothly throughout the year,
students can take that as evidence
that you've done a good job?
A: My job day-to-day involves
replying to a lot of requests by all the
different clubs; management-type
stuff.
How I handle that is very obvious
to the clubs directly. Hopefully lots of
people will see me do a good job this
year, but the people who don’t see the
direct impact may be the ones who
actually vote – because people who
are unhappy tend to want to voice
their concerns, as opposed to satisfied
people not bothering to vote.
B: Are you involved in deciding
how much funding each club gets?
A: Yes.
B: Do you think open office
sessions are needed? Do people
have valuable opinions about the
running of clubs?
A: Yeah. I think students’ opinions
should be taken into account. I’m
not sure about hot desk-type sessions
though, because last year’s were not
well-attended, I think.
B: I think they were badly
publicised though! Anyway, do you
have any comments about your
predecessor?
A: Yas was amazing, she also gave a
fantastic handover.
B: It's interesting that you're
doing a sabb year in the middle of
your degree. Do you think the fact
that you'll have to go back to being
a student after this year will affect
what you do this year?
A: Yeah, I think it serves as
motivation to do a good job, because
I want to continue to be heavily
involved in clubs when I return. If
I change something, it will directly
affect me!
B: Can you run me through your
day to day tasks?
A: I tend to get in and spend a
couple of hours replying to emails.
Then I’ll have a meeting with a club;
either an event budget or a room
booking. There’s always something, I
generally have a couple of meetings
with different clubs every day!
Probably a meeting with someone
at the Union; a catch-up or planning
and executing a task. Most days there
is also a meeting with College, eg:
about power outlets on Queen’s Lawn,
or clubs Open Days.
B: Are you consulted about the
sports grounds Imperial owns?
A: Commercially-sensitive
things are generally just decided by
College and dealt with by the Union
President, due to the high level of
confidentiality. But in terms of how
clubs go to the sports grounds and
how they use them, that’s part of the
sports partnership the Union has with
College. I do have some involvement
in it, but not a great deal.
B: What do you think about
College closing Teddington sports
grounds?
A: There were a weird couple of
months where we didn’t really know
what was going on, but College then
clarified things for us. I don’t know
much about the loss of Teddington
grounds, but it is to the benefit of
gaining Heston, which is fantastic.
B: Is Heston further away?
A: Yes, it is further, and it is less
accessible by public transport, which
is a bit of an issue. But having it
next to Harlington, it’s much easier
to have two grounds next to each
other. The benefits of Heston though
is that not only does it have sports
fields, it has indoor space, including a
theatre. So hopefully we can get more
involvement from Heston than just
use of it as sports grounds.
B: Things like this makes it seem
like the Union has little impact on
the decision that is reached.
A: Yeah. These places are owned
by College, so we can only inform
College about the impact it will have
on students.
B: But even then, College don't
have to listen?
A: (awkward silence)
B: So your job is to represent the
student view, but in the end what
they do with that is up to them?
A: Yeah, basically…
B: I'm only asking to clarify,
because there are loads of students
who are really angry with the
Union for not doing a good enough
job with regards to doing what the
students want. But in reality, it
isn't the Union's fault!
A: Yeah, there are many meetings
and decisions which are made
solely by College, and they don’t
communicate anything to the Union,
so it’s really hard to organise a
rebuttal.
So with Teddington, now we know
for sure that the medics can’t have
it any more, we can only try and do
everything we can to make sure that
they are properly represented at
Heston.
B: What about the people you
work with in the office? The non-
sabb full time workers?
A: I’ve got the 3 student activities
workers (manager, administrator,
coordinator) and someone who
supports the sports partnership.
B: Who hires them?
A: The Union hires them; I sat on
the panel for some of them. There is
input from the sabbs about who gets
hired.
B: So do they work under you?
A: -Ish. Technically the sabbs are in
control of the way the Union is run in
certain respects. But their day to day
jobs are not determined by us. They
report to the Managing Director, who
is below Tom.
We’re not exactly in charge of
them, but they do answer to us. We
determine the direction we want the
Union to go.
B: Okay. But in the end, what the
Union does this year IS decided by
the sabbatical team?
A: We give an idea of the aims and
goals we want to achieve. But in the
end, there are things which have to
be run every year, like the finances of
the Union.
But we can propose the changes we
want to make.
"I think
students'
opinions
should
be taken
into
account."
"I want
to try
and make
everything
run as
smoothly
as possible,
to make
sure
everything
is working."
B: What's the thing you most like
or dislike about the Union?
A: I like the atmosphere. The fact
that we’re students but we can help in
the running of the Union. In terms
of dislike: not having enough time.
I get so many requests that need
answering, but I have meetings and
so much other stuff.
B: In terms of Press, does College
influence the Union? Or is there a
clear separation between the Union
and the College?
A: The Union has its own
Communications department. They
make sure that everything we say is
representative of the Union and what
the students think. College Comms
runs separately and they often get
one of our representatives to give a
statement.
B: Alright, you can have some
fun questions. If you were trapped
on a desert island with the other
Sabbs, who do you think you would
collectively eat first? Or: who do
you think would be the last person
to survive?
A: Tom would definitely outlive us
all. He’s got outdoor survival skills.
I’m not sure who we would eat first. It
would depend on how useful people
prove themselves to be.
B: Did you go out a lot in your
freshers year? Can you recommend
any places or any to avoid?
A: I did go out a fair bit in my first
year, but I was also in a lot of clubs, so
I didn’t have that much time. I would
not advice going to Propaganda
too much: as much as you think it’s
amazing in first year, it is never
that good. I haven’t been out for
quite a while, but I quite like Roxy’s
and some places in Vauxhall too. In
terms of pubs, you can’t beat a good
‘Spoons,’ B@1 or a decent cocktail bar.
B: If you had to eat one meal
from 568 for the rest of your life,
what would it be?
A: The halloumi salad is pretty
good. And you wouldn’t be
disgustingly unhealthy.
B: If you were allowed to name
a Union drinking bar, what would
you name it?
A: I feel I would be letting the
student body down if we didn’t name
it a science pun... But I can’t think of
one right now!
