Outlast is a game I’d wanted to
play for ages. I was playing a
lot of Slenderman and Amnesia
at the time it came out, but as I had
just bought Machine for Pigs I couldn’t
justify to myself the cost of yet another
horror game. Fortunately, I recently
found Outlast and its expansion,
Whistleblower, on sale and I was able to
pick them up and finally play Outlast.
On the surface Outlast is a pretty
simple game. You play as a journalist
who has heard of some shady goings
on at Mount Massive Asylum. Armed
with your trusty camera with night
vision mode you sneak into the
Asylum and quickly realise that it was
a really, really bad move. The main
objective of Outlast is to escape the
Asylum which is hard as events make
it so you can’t go back and pushes
you further into the darkness. The
game itself, on normal difficulty. is
not difficult: the controls are easy;
the puzzles are often simple; and the
game seems to always push you in the
right direction. Outlast is fun because
it is the most terrifying game I’ve ever
played.
When I first started I didn’t know
what to expect, but 20 minutes in I had
jumped out of my chair, paused the
game and nearly turned my computer
off in a panic. After that I was very
wary of every door, every turn in the
corridors and every button push. Even
by being careful, being on high alert
and expecting to jump Outlast catches
you out every time and creates an
atmosphere in which you are never
safe. You could run through the game
never looking back, but you can’t
help but walk around slowly and peep
round corners.
It’s this constant fear of an enemy
jumping out or the lights turning off
and having to use the night vision on
your camera only to realise its run out
of battery and you are plunged into
darkness anyway that makes Outlast so
enjoyable.
Outlast has some collectible
documents as well as the insane mode
in which dying sends you back to the
start to appeal to the more hardcore
gamers. For everyone else it’s a horror
experience that draws you in just a
little bit more than it scares you away.
It is a great game that will keep you
entertained for hours and I would
recommend it to all horror fans.
