Following the completion of
its inquiry into Imperial’s
animal research and testing
practices, the Home Office has
declared the allegations of widespread
animal abuse and cruelty made
against Imperial College London
in April 2013 as “[not having] been
substantiated.”
The inquiry was put into motion
after a damning report released by
the British Union for the Abolition of
Vivisection (BUAV), which conducted
an undercover investigation in 2012
at Imperial. The BUAV alleged,
among other things, “appalling
animal suffering” on a “very large
scale” and widespread breaches
of the law taking place in College
laboratories. A graphic 9-minute clip
featuring footage taken by hidden
cameras was also uploaded to the
union’s campaign webpage.
Out of the 180 allegations made by
the BUAV against Imperial, only five
were upheld, with the five leading
to formal technical non-compliance
cases. These resulted in sanctions to
eight individuals, which included
letters of reprimand and further
training. However the Home Office
says these non-compliances with
regulations were “of a persistent
nature” and “could broadly be traced
back to failing in management
structures”, classifying them as
“minor”.
The majority of these were in
Category B, which meant that while
there may have been “some animal
welfare implications“, it “[did] not
involve significant, avoidable or
unnecessary pain, suffering, distress
or lasting harm”, and there was “no
evidence of intent to subvert the
controls of ASPA [the Animals
(Scientific Procedures) Act 1986]”.
The Home Office report,
published on the 2nd of October,
cites that “there are a wide range
of managerial tools in place at
[Imperial], which should have the
effect of supporting compliance
with ASPA and encouraging a good
culture of responsibility and care
for the animals used in scientific
procedures[...]there have been positive
efforts by the Establishment at
managerial and Named Person level
to address a number of issues, both
before and since the exposé.“
The findings and recommendations
made by the Home Office are in
line with the independent academic
inquiry ordered by College last
year following the BUAV report.
Chaired by Prof Steve Brown from
the Medical Research Council’s
Mammalian Genetics Unit, the
independent panel reviewed
Imperial’s culture and approach to
animal care and welfare.
