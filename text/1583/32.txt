Volleyball expecting great season
The women’s team began last
season with less than optimal
conditions; only few players
from the previous year remained,
and the Saturday trainings in Brixton
not only clashed with our coach’s
timetable, but also made it difficult to
attract new members.
However, the effort and encour-
agement from many of the club’s
members quickly resulted in a
new coach being appointed for the
women’s team as well as great overall
enthusiasm. The amazing spirit and
atmosphere helped the players train
and bond as a team. Unfortunately,
many more challenges were to follow,
including a crucial match against
Portsmouth ending in a 2-2 tie when
time ran out at their venue (which
they strongly argued should give
them a win – fortunately following
weeks of rescheduling problems – the
match was re-played and won 3-0 by
us!), or the day of the match against
Brunel University, which, after pre-
paring an elaborate route to get out
of London during the infamous tube
strikes, was cancelled two hours be-
fore the scheduled start time. Despite
these and a number of similar com-
plications, the team pushed through
with determination (and with weekly
nights of antics at the Eastside Bar),
collecting enough points to win and
finally advance back into the 1st divi-
sion of the BUCS volleyball league!
Volleyball is definitely still an
up-and-coming sport in the UK, as
explained by Emily Lehtonen, last
year’s women’s team BUCS captain.
“For a long time after I started play-
ing on the Imperial College Volley-
ball team, my friends would ask “How
was netball practice?” Although well-
intentioned, this does not go down
well when you dedicate a significant
portion of your time to training for
the said sport. Especially after your
coach has had you diving across the
court to receive exceedingly tricky
serves twenty times in a row.
This, in addition to the general
stereotype of ‘babes in bikinis’ on a
beach, which is so often attached to
volleyball, makes running a serious
volleyball club somewhat challeng-
ing. However, when you play as
technical and teamwork-based a sport
as volleyball three times a week with
the same people, you get to know
them well and share some fantastic
experiences, such as playing matches
at a London 2012 Olympic venue and
experiencing the exhilaration of a 3-0
win in the match that determines the
top-placing team in the league!”
Following last year’s successful and,
more importantly, fun season, the
club is looking forward to welcoming
new and returning members.
Last year’s members are keen to
return to the court as well as continue
the off-court excitement; with social
events ranging from dinners to ice
skating, bar nights and bowling!
The club is open to players of all
levels and we therefore hope to see
many of you at one of our training
sessions or social events.
The Volleyball Club wants to
welcome all Freshers to the university
and wish you all the best as you start
your journey at Imperial College.

Keeping the Ball Rolling in Basketball
Did you know that basketball
was randomly invented on a
rainy day in New England?
Because of the bad weather, students
couldn’t play outdoor sports. A fit-
ness education teacher thus decided
to put two baskets on opposing ends
of a court and a football in between.
As simple as it sounds, the game of
basketball was made. Here in Eng-
land, we do not fear bad weather (but
we don’t really like it either, do we?).
Yet, basketball is growing consider-
ably. And to see this, what better place
is there than your dear university?
The number of people joining the
Imperial College Basketball society
has doubled over the past two years.
From 50 people in 2011 to 100 last
year, IC Basketball has asserted
itself as one of the key sports socie-
ties at Imperial. Things were taken
to another level last year with the
establishment of a new partnership
between the London Lions and IC
Basketball. The Lions compete in the
British Basketball League (BBL), the
top men’s basketball league in the UK.
Among the many crazy benefits from
the partnership, IC Basketball played
their varsity game at the Copper Box,
home court of the Lions and Olympic
venue for basketball.
IC Basketball is divided into 3
teams: Women’s (BUCS 1st Division),
Men’s 1st (BUCS 3rd Division), Men’s
2nd (BUCS 4th Division). Notice-
ably, the women’s team enjoyed an
outstanding season last year, winning
both BUCS 2nd Division and LUSL
Cup titles. Nonetheless, this division
between the 3 teams does not hinder
the society from coming together for
many sports and social events. For in-
CEDRIC COLLE
PUBLICITY OFFICER
stance, IC Basketball organises weekly
development sessions for students
to work on their game, or simply
learn all the basics. On a personal
basis, I was a near beginner last year.
Attending these sessions throughout
the year has dramatically helped me
to improve my game. This year, I am
confident that I can potentially join
one of the teams. In addition to the
sessions, IC Basketball has previ-
ously taken part in international
tournaments in France, Holland and
Germany. For 2014-15, the society
plans a year full of 4v4 mixed tourna-
ments, All Star Competitions (with
dunk, three-pointer, and free throw
contests), monthly socials, ACC sports
nights and many more.
Outside of LeBron’s return to Cleve-
land, that’s definitely something to
look out for this year!
Finally, here are two facts about
basketball:
Fact One: 7-foot tall American
males have a 17% chance of playing
in the NBA.
Fact Two: Imperial students, what-
ever their size, have a 100%chance of
having fun with IC Basketball.
In case you
missed it...

of writing in a critical but stable
condition.
In Cricket Kevin Pietersen has
released his autobiography,in
which he makes assertions about

The FA has suggested that
England could play its games

seconds of the match and yet
carried on for the full game.
