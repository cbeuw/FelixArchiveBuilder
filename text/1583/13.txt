Money can’t buy happiness
John Park tells all about Maps to the Stars
One can only hope that the
Hollywood we see in David
Cronenberg’s Maps to the
Stars is not an accurate depiction of
the film industry in any way. We
hear stories of abuse, but mostly
Hollywood is a place that likes to keep
up its appearances. But writer Bruce
Wagner is not exactly in the mood
for holding back. What is portrayed
in Maps to the Stars is bizarre and
downright horrendous. The level of
desperation characters sink into for
what they want is an uncomfortable
sight, and when it is portrayed in such
a graphic, straightforward fashion,
the events here become all the more
shocking for the audience.
To describe fading star Havanna
Segrand (Julianne Moore) as unstable
would be a big understatement. Doing
whatever she can to salvage what
seemingly little she has left of her
movie career, this ageing actress is
eager to play the same role her late
mother starred in. But it never helps
when you are not the director’s first
choice for the lead role. This, coupled
with Havanna’s hallucinatory,
nightmarish haunting from the ghost
of her mother (Sarah Gadon) makes
matters worse.
Not being good enough, young
enough, to survive in the tough
industry are the paranoid thoughts
that plague her mind, and in her
Cannes Best Actress-winning
performance, Moore brings out the
tragically fragile, vulnerable, insecure
desperation out of Havanna, as she
blunders through life and career.
Havanna goes on to hire a ‘chore
whore’ a charming term used to
describe her personal assistant,
Agatha (Mia Wasikowska). It becomes
quickly clear that Agatha, the quiet,
obedient young woman is not quite as
innocent as she seems. Like everyone
in this town, Agatha has her own goal
to achieve, which forms a part of a
storyline that turns more shocking
with every little reveal.
Who else is involved in this dark,
twisted tale? Havanna’s therapist,
of course, Dr Stafford Weiss (John
Cusack), who uses some rather odd,
unconventional methods to help the
actress work through her problems.
Havanna cites childhood abuse as a
root of her problems, an accusation
her ghost mother vehemently denies
in one of her freak entrances. The
Weiss family shows us the definition
of a reality show freak family gone
horribly wrong. They may not have
cameras following them around
recording their daily activities, but
they might as well have a show of
their own, because the skeleton in
their closet is too juicy not to be
rattled out.
Stafford’s son Benjie (Evan Bird)
is a teen star sensation who has been
in and out of rehab for substance
abuse, his mother Cristina (Olivia
Williams) acts as his manager, taking
ambitious control of her young
brat’s money-making career. This is
a family formed on egos and dreams,
which can be healthy in certain
circumstances, but not when there
is an unspeakble secret looming that
will threaten to destroy everything
they have built to preserve.
Cronenberg’s newest film is a
collection of nightmares characters
endure. Everyone has something
troubling that truly takes over their
psychological well-being, and when
their world comes crashing down
in one way or another, the struggle
to hold on to anything normal is
clearly easier said than done. The
baggage each character is burdened
with is substantial, and it is a wonder
that they have all made it this far in
their lives. Setting up the problems,
essentially what covers the film’s first
half or so, is where the film excels.
There is plenty of excellent build-up,
utilising unique characters portrayed
by actors skilled enough to play them.
But it is towards the film’s final
act the plot begins to lose its grip.
It becomes so focused on shocking
the audience with gasp-worthy
reveals that it stops being about
the characters. The Weiss family,
Havanna, and Agatha are all heavily
affected by their personal crises, but
what we see is only the immediate
result, never the long-term
consequences. The film leaves all too
much hanging in the air, with very
little explanation to wrap up each
storyline.
The handling of Havanna’s plot
strand is a cop-out, and how Agatha
and the Weiss family end can hardly
be described as satisfactory. This is a
shame, because the finale never quite
does the cast justice.
What starts off promisingly as
a dark, wickedly funny satire into
the lives of Hollywood stars quickly
turns into a game of which plot
development can have the most
gasping impact, and through that it
loses its way. But the performances
are uniformly spectacular, which
does make it all the more bearable to
hold on until the madness comes to
an end.

Gone, baby, gone
Jack Steadman tries not to wince at Gone Girl
Right out of the starting blocks,
Gone Girl screams that it was
made by David Fincher. The
20th Century Fox logo plays out
without its usual fanfare (an echo of
its corruption at the opening of Alien
3), before the film lays out its trump
cards very clear: this is not what you
were expecting (unless you’ve read the
book).
Eerie shots of an empty town
at daybreak, a voice-over from
Ben Affleck’s Nick that almost
immediately starts discussing
cracking open his wife Amy
(Rosamund Pike)’s head to get at the
secrets inside, and a perfectly pitched
score from Trent Reznor and Atticus
Ross – it all builds to make an opening
that leaves you feeling grimy, dirty,
even before it all starts going wrong.
Then, when it all starts going
wrong, the film refuses to let you
settle. This is no straight-forward
tale of abduction – it’s something
far more complex. Flashbacks so
cute you want to punch them in
the face (to paraphrase a line from
Amy on her relationship with Nick
in its early stages) riddle the gloom,
punctuating the relentless drive of
the investigation with a look at the
circumstances preceding it, a breath
of happiness and joy amidst all the
horror.
Powered by Amy’s narration, the
flashbacks give the film context,
allowing you to care about a character
we barely see in the modern storyline
– and then using that to hurt you.
The flashbacks take a turn for the
ugly, the darkness infects the light of
those early, special moments, and all
is not as it seems. Twists hide behind
every dark corner, and just as it all
threatens to build to a climax, to spill
over into the truth: the film pulls
the rug from under you. And it is
masterful.
Fincher really gives his actors space
to breathe in a film that is otherwise
clinically precise as it relays the story
in a Crime Scene Investigation style.
He does this by forcing his actors
to undergo mulitple hundreds of
takes and has previously said that if
you spend millions on building sets,
hiring cameras, and buying rights to a
story, you might as well spend a long
time with your actors getting each
take totally perfect.
This has really paid off as each
cast member is able to show their
character’s flaws whilst remaining
totally believable.
The film’s twisty-turny plot
is sold by the cast – Ben Affleck
continues his trend of excellent
movies, managing to make the
mostly unlikeable Nick weirdly
sympathetic (and also either relatable
or understandable, with each word
becoming more relevant at various
points throughout the film). As the
eponymous girl, Rosamund Pike
finally makes her (ridiculously)
belated step up to leading lady, and
it’s nothing short of magnificent.
Despite being – obviously – ‘gone’
for much of the film, she still makes
an undeniable impact, selling the
film even when it sometimes verges
on the ridiculous. The supporting
cast make an impact here, too –
notably Neil Patrick Harris, in what
is possibly the most against-type
role possible as Amy’s stalker-ish,
obsessive ex-boyfriend. In part, it’s
this willingness on Fincher’s part to
toy with our expectations – and to go
on to subvert them so maliciously,
that really helps push the film past
the occasional leaps of faith it is
forced to demand in the name of
pushing the story forward.
Despite said leaps, Gillian Flynn’s
adaptation of her own novel is mostly
an exercise in adaptation done right,
as she takes to the opportunity to
nip and tuck here and there, finding
ways to ensure the book’s style seeps
through, while also seizing the chance
to alter the ending from the original.
Having failed to read the book,
I can’t confirm just how different
it is – but it works, regardless. The
tension refuses to let up – mostly in
part due to the fact that every time
a new answer is given, it creates a
spider’s web of questions that – when
combined with Fincher’s directorial
flair – draw you further into the
seething cauldron of lies and deceit
that sit at the heart of Gone Girl.
It’s that combination that elevates
Gone Girl to become something
more – the script is strong, but it isn’t
perfect, so what truly pushes the film
up is how it comes alive in Fincher’s
hands. It always felt like the perfect
film for the man, but there’s no sense
of him just being on auto-pilot here.
It’s the complete opposite – there’s
a sense of Fincher having the time
of his life, gleefully using the tale to
take potshots at several targets. The
media are among those hit hardest –
the film is an evisceration of almost
everything they are and do – but
in the end, it’s marriage that truly
suffers. Gone Girl is the antithesis of
a date movie. Which is pretty much
why everyone should see it.
