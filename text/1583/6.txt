"Newspapers like to
hold students to a
higher standard than
everyone else."
Should the West intervene in Iraq to fight ISIS?
Bruce Weaver argues for military action, but Niall Jeffrey thinks we should
stay well away
We should send troops into
Iraq to fight ISIS because,
if we do not, ISIS will win.
The terrorist group controls large
parts of Syria and Northern Iraq and
will soon take over the key border
town of Kobani. Kurdish fighters
armed with western weapons and
supported by US airstrikes have
not stopped ISIS’s advance as we
hoped they would. Letting ISIS win
the war in Iraq would mean death
and displacement for the religious
minorities in northern Iraq and
would destabilise the entire region.
Iraq needs a larger, more advanced
army and only the West can provide
that. The West should send a
multilateral task force into Northern
Iraq to fight with the Kurds and push
back the advance of ISIS.
This will work because, although
ISIS are strong enough to win a war
against Kurdish and Iraqi fighters,
they will crumble when faced with
a better funded force such as the
British or US army. For a group such
as ISIS, their support relies on them
continuing to win. The romance, as
it is to some, of an Islamic State will
fade when they start losing battles to
the ‘infidels’.
This is not the same as the Iraq War
10 years ago. We are not invading
to remove an established leader like
Saddam Hussein, we are intervening
to expel a foreign threat.
The people of Iraq do not want ISIS,
and minorities – such as the Yazidis
– see them as an existential threat.
ISIS has no major allies to come to
its aid and scant support amongst
the civilians they now control. A
liberation force would be welcomed
as long as it was made clear it was a
temporary measure.
Expelling ISIS from Iraq would
deliver the kind of defeat to the
terrorist group that would destroy its
momentum and cause its members
to lose faith in the leadership. A
defeated ISIS would descend into
infighting within Syria that would
stop it becoming a serious external
threat again.
Some may argue that it is the job
of the Middle East to solve its own
problems. However the powers that
exist in the Middle East are not ready
to solve this problem.
Iran is the only military force
powerful enough to tackle ISIS, but
an intervention from Iran without
the support of Saudi Arabia would be
seen as provocative. However support
from Saudi Arabia is unlikely,
especially in the short term. The
situation calls for fast action and only
the West can provide that.
If ISIS are allowed to advance
thousands more civilians might die
by their hands and even more will
suffer under their rule.
As a nation partly responsible for
creating conditions in which they
could thrive we must intervene
to prevent further atrocities.
Furthermore, we are unique in the
world in our capacity and willingness
to combat ISIS. It is for all these
reasons that we should intervene in
Iraq.
The self-declared Islamic State
is clearly an enemy to the life
and liberty of people across
the world. They are most directly a
threat to those who live in Iraq, Syria
and neighbouring countries. They
clearly need to be stopped, but not by
western military intervention.
In the most perfect outcome for
any intervention in Iraq, ISIS will
still exist in Syria. If ISIS is somehow
removed from civil-war torn Syria,
it will still exist in Algeria, Libya and
Lebanon. This thriving organisation,
against the backdrop of perceived US
led attacks on the Middle East, will
doubtless have a far easier task of
recruitment.
Despite having the intent of aiding
the Iraqi government, the US and
European presence in the conflict
galvanises the anti-western ideology
that is needed for ISIS’s survival.
It is clear that ISIS want a military
response in the region. The tactic of
kidnap and murder is coupled with
an online media strategy that begs for
western reprisal.
ISIS wants a US military
intervention. At the point where
the conflict is no longer with
the democratically elected Iraqi
government, but instead against a
foreign aggressor, ISIS can portray
itself as a movement of the people.
The Iraqi government army can beat
this opponent, but is currently losing
more and more troops to propaganda.
The years of wars in the Middle
East has led to a less than warm
feeling towards the US and European
governments among most people.
Additional foreign airstrikes do not
bestow any trust on your would-be
allies. They give ISIS even more
opportunity to portray the elected
Iraqi government as being in cahoots
with invaders.
Airstrikes that aim to strategically
destroy the ability of ISIS to continue,
also destroy the ability of civilians to
continue to live their lives. Targets
of strategic importance are things
that ISIS need to travel, support and
supply themselves. Depots, roads,
and communal buildings are all
destroyed in airstrikes.
Innocent civilians are also killed.
Islamic State troops integrate
themselves and their equipment
within towns. It is impossible to
attack the strategic targets and troops
without endangering the lives of
innocent people.
It is true that strategic airstrikes
hinders ISIS at this instant. It may, at
best, stop ISIS from returning to these
areas. But the real fight is against an
ideology. When a community loses
the infrastructure it needs, there will
be those from that community who
do not blame ISIS, instead many will
buy into the tales that they are being
told by ISIS themselves.
Troops on the ground lead to even
more chance of catastrophically fatal
errors, especially when the enemy is
not clearly noticeable amongst the
local populace.
Our experience in Iraq that led to
the creation of ISIS shows that troops
alienate and anger many people.

force

In my sixth form, one student
noticed two things: (1) A river
boat which did river tours by
day had a bar and (2) Durham Police
don’t have a marine division. Putting
two together, they began to organise
boat parties where 150 sixth formers
would cram onto a boat to be ferried
up and down the river listening to bad
music and enjoying the lax bar.
With this in mind, I was quite
sympathetic to the news this week,
where a Medic fresher had a few too
many drinks and finished the night
with the RNLI life boat picking
her up. Best wishes to her, I hope
she’s suffering nothing more than
a bad hangover and fair amount of
embarrassment.
I read about this in the London
Evening Standard. Newspapers like
to hold students to a higher standard
than everyone else, ‘random person
taken ill from too much alcohol in
Soho’ doesn’t really hit the papers.
Older students will remember the
infamous Daily Mail report, “Pass the
sick bag: The antics of these Imperial
College medical students should
worry us all” where a Daily Mail
reporter crashed Reynolds bar and
wrote all about it. It wasn’t obvious
whether students were more annoyed
by the biased article, or the line “The
average A-level requirement for
students is a brain-stretching AAB.”
AAB? I needed A**A*A*A I’ll have you
know.
It’s not just students the media
tends to pick on, it’s teenagers
and young people generally too.
Remember Paris Brown, Youth
Commissioner at Kent Police who
was forced from her job by The
Daily Mail after being ‘exposed’
for some inappropriate tweets she
made two years previously? They
quoted Keith Vaz MP who called for
her resignation, despite himself not
resigning when he was exposed for
claiming £75,000 for a second home,
despite his family house being 12
miles from Parliament. I’d say that
was more inappropriate than some
mildly offensive tweets.
In the media’s defence, we do
occasionally get the heart-warming
story of the ‘geek done good’. The
“ Teenager comes up with best-
selling app whilst bored in school”
kind of stories. I hate those stories.
They always seem to patronise the
inventor, to be written by reporters
who obviously have no idea how the
thing works and are filled with the
same dull questions. “What do your
friends think? How come you’re so
clever? Are you socially retarded?”
I like to think as the media gets
younger/more diverse this will
begin to change. It has to, otherwise
younger generations will just get their
news and analysis from elsewhere.
Let’s hope that news starts to treat
young people more fairly, or at
the very least that younger news
organisations can start to pick on
older people too.
Next week Felix should trace
through the tweets from college
lecturers and print the juiciest, or
maybe we’ll invite a few on a pub
crawl then print pictures of them
drunk with traffic cones on their
heads.
You have been warned.
It’s time the news started to treat us fairly
