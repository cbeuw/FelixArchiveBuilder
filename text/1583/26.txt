What’s up, Imperial? In the
spirit of Mental Health
Awareness Week, I think
it’s high time we had a quick chat
about mental illness. First of all, I
want to come right off the bat and
say that I am in no way an expert,
or a mental health professional of
any kind, and everything I write
about is based purely off of my own
experiences, and those of others who
have felt comfortable enough to share
their experiences with me. That being
said, you shouldn’t need to be an
expert to talk about something that
affects approximately 1 in 6 adults at
any given time.
“Diba, surely if it was that serious,
more people would be talking about
it!” You’d probably be saying right
about now if this weren’t a written
article, and I would be inclined to
agree. The reason, hypothetical
person in my head, is because
unfortunately, thanks to gross
misrepresentation of mental illness
and those suffering from it in the
media, and just a generally poor
understanding of various mental
health problems, there is huge stigma
attached to them.
This stigma makes it very difficult
for people to openly discuss mental
health problems without the fear of
being judged or even jeopardising
their friends, family, and careers.
When we don’t feel safe enough
to discuss such critical matters,
then things tend to just get worse
and worse, and the stigma never
disappears.
Stigma is bred from common
misconceptions held by a
frighteningly large number of people,
such as those who accuse people of
‘making it all up for attention’, or
classify mental health sufferers as
violent. Not only is this extremely
sad, it’s also so incredibly inaccurate
that I want to slap each and every one
of these people across the face with a
copy of the largest psychiatry book I
can find in the hopes that some of the
information will seep in.
Now, joking aside, as much as I
would love to take the moral high
ground and say that I’ve always been
some open-minded, enlightened,
progressive advocate of social justice
(or something potentially less
controversial), it just wouldn’t be
true. Because I was also bombarded
with countless accounts of people
with schizophrenia or bipolar
disorders “ committing acts of
violence” on TV, or heard people
with depression being told to just
“get a grip”, as if those three words
would magically cure them. I was
never exposed to open dialogue about
mental health, was only ever told that
some people are just crazy and should
be avoided, no questions asked. That’s
neither true nor is it acceptable
behaviour, and it needs to stop!
What we need to do is stop avoiding
the issues of mental health and talk
about the facts as candidly as we can,
because suffering from a mental
illness doesn’t make you any less of a
person, nor does it suddenly render
you incapable of leading a normal
life.
Now that we’ve established that,
and listened to my little, probably
one-off, rant, let’s get down to
business. What do I hope to achieve
from all this? Well, I simply want us
to start talking about it, and to spread
accurate information about mental
health issues.
By sharing both facts and real-
life experiences (if and only if you
feel safe doing so, of course), we can
slowly eradicate what seems like
centuries of stigma, to allow those of
us in need of help to come forward
and receive the support we need
without the added fear of judgement
on top of everything else.
