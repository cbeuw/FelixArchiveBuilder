Hey ho! Silence. We know what
it means. Cavers returning.
The kettle lets out a hisssss
and gurgles. A tackle bag falls heavily
on the floor and we all look up. “Hey
ho!” And conversations resume, “Yes
this word fits”, “What about fifteen
down ?”, “Does it go?”, “Tea is up!”,
“Where’s the cow ?”
I am sat in the bivi, a large
depression with an overhanging rock
bridge on the Migovec Plateau in
the Triglav National Park, Western
Slovenia. From the Sunset Spot,
one can gaze all the way to Italy
and during a clear sunset one can
even spot the Dolomites rising in
the distance, shadows crowned with
russet light. West of Migovec is the
Krn massif, former Soča front during
WWI, sometimes wreathed in storm
clouds while stars twinkle upon
Migovec.
Those are the first things I learnt
as an expedition Fresher. Then come
the more prosaic rules: when and how
to use the toilet facilities (a dignified
pit), not falling into M10 (a 30 metre
open pitch) when leaving the bivi at
night, where to pitch the tent, how
to successfully manufacture a ‘dwarf
pine sofa’ etc...
Living for five weeks at 1850
metres of elevation, three hours
from civilisation is almost as remote
as you can get in terms of summer
expedition. Water? Collected with
tarpaulins into barrels. Electricity?
Collected via solar panels. That’s the
problem with a ‘hollow’ mountain:
there are no overground streams
for water collection or electricity
production. Food? Hunted for in
British supermarkets and cooked
on petrol stoves. There is always
the latest teaspoon spinning device
available and a myriad of other
ingenious contraptions to make
mountain life easier. To quote the
expedition veterans “they must
invent not just explore”.
I am sat in the bivi, discussing
possible leads with the old lags
and the returning cavers. I book
four nights in the underground
camp and start preparing my kit.
Tomorrow, another caver and I are
going to explore at –700m with a
chisel, crowbar, and hammer. We
have a 600kg rock to shift in order
to squeeze past. I hear tales of the
chamber beyond, and the roar of a
waterfall afterwards. As excitement
builds up, so does apprehension. I’ve
been down at underground camp,
I’ve been at the southern most point
of the cave, a good three hours from
camp and from there five hours to
the surface. But I’ve never slept at
camp X-Ray more than two nights in
a row, and I’ve never done more than
one pushing trip. There’s no knowing
what you sign up for when going
pushing which is either thrilling or
sobering.
The next day we set off in pair
and walk to the cave entrance, a few
minutes off the bivi. We enter the
cave. 98 hours later, we make it out,
exhausted and elated. It is four in
the afternoon and we enjoy the smell
of dwarf pine mixed with earthy
fragrances we were starting to miss.
The temperature is a delight after the
ubiquitous 1°C of the cave. Twenty
minutes later we arrive at the bivi.
“Hey ho!”
Silence.
“Does it go?”
“Do you want some tea?”
“Yes”
“Cow?”
“No”...
“Yes the cave goes, it always goes,
the mountain is hollow after all.”
After the rock was shifted – it took
us three hours – we found a small
chamber, at the end of which a pitch
head awaited us. So we rigged it the
day after and descended into an
active streamway. Not the roaring
torrent we were expecting but some
water nonetheless. From then we
crawled into an oblique rift and
found another pitch head. Whilst
clearing it of unstable boulders,
one rock shifted into the gap and
obstructed the way on.
The day after, with a chisel and
crowbar we attacked it until it yielded
another chamber, more rift and a
third pitch. This we descended on the
last day, and walked down more tight
rift, free climbing over pristine pools
of water until we were faced with a
last circular shaft, seven metres deep.
We surveyed our finds, slept at camp
and got out.
“Shall we enter the survey data
now?”, “Of course”. And little by little
the 150 metres or so of passage are
added to the grand survey. What a joy
to see four days worth of work take
shape before one’s eyes! Where does
it head to? Is it blank mountain? As
ever we raise more questions than we
actually answer.
There lies the thrill of exploration:
more people have been to the Moon
than in the passage we found.
Tomorrow though is the expedition
D-Day. This is the final caving day
when we will put the cave to sleep for
another year by packing up camp X-
Ray and finally head down to Tolmin
the nearby town in the valley before
the long journey home. Migovec, I’ll
be back.
