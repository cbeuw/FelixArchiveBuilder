My Art: The Cholmondeley Ladies
The Cholmondeley Ladies, British School 17th Century Photo: Tate Britain
"A Daily
Mail story,
captured
in oils; a
Ripley's
Believe it
or Not for
the 1600s"
In the Tate Britain, among the
historical portraits and seascapes,
the Van Dyke’s and Van Eyck’s,
there is one picture that never
fails to catch my eye. Entering the
1540 room, marking the beginning
of British fine art, four pairs of
eyes glare out at you from a single
panel. An oil painting on wood, The
Cholmondeley Ladies depicts two
women, dressed in bleached-white
finery, and resembling pieces of
bone china, who each carry an infant
swaddled in a blood red christening
gown.
An inscription in gold provides
some context, telling us they these
two women ‘were born the same day,
Married the same day, and brought to
Bed the same day’.
It is a Daily Mail story, captured in
oils; a Ripley’s Believe It or Not for
the 1600s.
I don’t know why I love the painting
so much. Perhaps it is formal
rigidity of the painting style. These
two ghostly apparitions and their
crimson bounties are starkly flat.
No attempt at depth has been made,
which, as well as giving the painting
an otherworldly feel, confers a sense
of modernism about it. Painted some
three centuries before Picasso’s Les
Demoiselles d’Avignon, it seems to
predict the radical geometry that
would become so popular during the
20th Century.
There is a beautiful symmetry
about the painting too, as if painted
by a forerunner of Wes Anderson,
which would suggest that the two
women were twins, and yet there are
subtle differences between the two:
their clothing differs, and their eye
colours don’t match - clearly they are
not identical twins.
And perhaps this is why I like it.
The air of mystery that envelops
the painting so tightly has a great
attraction to me. We have no idea
who these ladies were, and no other
historical record exists of them. The
rigid poses of the women, who cradle
their babies indifferently, is not
found in any other work of the same
period, apart from tomb sculpture,
so perhaps this is a tribute to women
who have died?
The painter is unknown, lost to
the annals of history, and the person
who donated it in 1955 remained
anonymous. Virginia Woolf said,
in her polemical book A Room of
One’s Own, ‘I would venture to guess
that Anon was often a woman’, and
this is something that I dearly hope
My Art: The V&A Ceramics Collection
Tucked away on the sixth floor
of the V&A, the ceramics
section is my little artistic idyll
in London. Even on weekends it is
virtually empty, so you can sit back
and enjoy the craftsmanship without
the hassle you get with the better
known art establishments. Huge
glass cabinets filled to the brim with
ceramics extend the whole length of
hallways, ensuring totally immersive
experience. It is little wonder then
that one can spend hours utterly
transfixed!
As you follow the collection

around, you are taken on a tour
through the history of the artform,
from the Far East through to Europe.
But don’t despair, it’s not just
row after row of Ming vases and
Wedgewood tea sets, there is also
an excellent collection of modern
ceramics from the 20th and 21st
centuries that is unlike anything
you have ever seen. One artist in
particular, Ryoji Koie, is a favourite of
mine in the way he gives the clay such
a fluid and dynamic feel that makes
you doubt whether the clay has been
fired at all!
The argument is often made of the
V&A that it can feel a bit stale, more a
catalogue of artifacts than something
thrilling. But this cannot be said of

SECTION EDITOR
Hello, and welcome to the
Felix Arts section from
this year’s awesome
editors, Fred and Kamil. We
hope to make this section a
lively community of discussion
with a wide range of articles
designed to intrigue, inform
and offend. Here, we provide
you with debates, reviews
and insider’s insight into the
capital’s art scene.
This issue we have a host of
great articles to share with you.
We start off by introducing our
new column My Art, in which
people talk us through their
favourite work of art; this week
Fred tries to unpick the mystery
behind a 16th Century portrait,
and Kamil explains his passion
for ceramics.
This is followed up with a
couple of reviews for two of
the hottest shows in London -
Barbican Centre’s Constructing
Worlds, an exploration of
the relationship between
architecture and photography;
and the Royal Academy’s
retrospective of Anslem Kiefer,
the legendary post-war German
artist.
We know it can often prove
daunting to find like-minded
art lovers at Imperial but
hopefully we can provide you
with a springboard into the uni’s
art world with your weekly dose
of culture and conversation;
starting as we mean to go on,
we have commissioned articles
from some of the leading artistic
societies at Imperial, so you can
find out what they get up to.
If you have any arts
submissions, drop us an email

against hope is true, since I am yet
to find a more beautiful depiction of
motherhood.
At its best, art attempts to describe
the human condition, and I feel
that The Cholmondeley Ladies
does just that. It is a depiction of
maternity, of pride. It is a history
lesson in miniature, showing us how
throughout all of human existence we
have been attracted to the unusual,
the bizarre.
Just look at the role that twins have
played throughout art, from the tales
of Romulus and Remus, all the way
through to Diane Arbus’ disquieting
1967 portrait of twin girls.
The Cholmondeley Ladies is just
one small part of this canon, and just
one small part of artistic history, but
to me it will always have a special
place.
the ceramics section because every
time I visit, the same sense of magic
and excitement returns to me as
if it were my first time visiting.
And such is the breadth and depth
of the collection that you do see
something new to fascinate you every
time, leaving you with a child-like
wonderment.
