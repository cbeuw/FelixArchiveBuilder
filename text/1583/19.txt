The Most Modern Machines for Living

Fred Fyles checks out Constructing Worlds at the Barbican Centre
"The links
between
buildings
and their
inhabitants
are subtly
revealed"
The relationship between the
architect and the camera
is symbiotic: as a uniquely
modern medium, photography is
perfectly suited to capturing the
environments in which we live.
From shanty towns in Soweto
to the towering skyscrapers of
Manhattan, photographers have
long been obsessed with the built
world that surrounds us. The
Barbican's Constructing Worlds draws
on the seemingly endless supply of
architectural photographers, as well
as the discerning tastes of curators
Alona Pardo and Elias Redstone,
providing us with a wide-ranging
overview of this fruitful history.
We begin with Berenice Abbott,
whose five year project, Changing New
York, documents the rapid expansion
of the city during the 1930s. These
sumptuous black and white images
contain the germ of modern city
photography, and alone stand as
testament to Abbott’s genius. In
these stark, angular constructions
girders and pipes burst out of the
Manhattan bedrock, twisting up like
vines to form a modern metropolis.
Although a contemporary and
friend of Abbott, Walker Evans’
photos could not be more different
in tone. Hired by the Farm Security
Administration to research rural
America, Evans documented the
debilitating effects of the Great
Depression on sharecroppers. Using a
mix of portraiture and architecture,
the links between buildings and
their inhabitants are subtly revealed:
between vernacular churches and
decaying plantation houses overrun
with black mould, Evans creates a
heady combination of rot and ruin
that matches any Southern gothic
written by Tennessee Williams.
Evans’ methodical approach
mirrors the work of Hilla and Bernd
Becher, whose quietly powerful
documentation of German water
towers reveals the unseen design that
surrounds us every day. Meanwhile,
Lucien Herve explores a slightly
more ostentatious piece of design
– Le Corbusier’s master plan of
Chandigarh, built as a shining beacon
of Indian modernity. Used to help
communicate Le Corbusier’s artistic
vision, Herve’s work is exhaustive
in its volume. Thankfully some of
his best pieces have been singled
out: explorations of shape, light,
and volume, they don’t resemble
buildings so much as constructivist
compositions.
Julius Shulman continues this
theme of documentation with his
photographs of the Case Study House
Program, in which aggressively
modernist houses compete with
retrograde mid-century furnishings
to paint a picture of American
convenience. In Case Study House
#22, his most celebrated photo, two
women in elegant ball gowns are
lounging on tasteful sofas, suspended
in a glass cube above a panorama of
the downtown LA sprawl.
As the exhibition continues to the
lower galleries, we experience the
work of architectural practice Office
KGDVS, who have transformed the
space into a series of interlocking
shapes, highlighting the dramatic
impact architecture and design can
have on the viewer. As the focus
moves away from America, and
becomes more modern, the work
looks less at the built environment
and more at social fabric.
Some artists featured are
unabashedly conceptual, such as
Luisa Lambri, who reduces the
vast masterpiece of Frank Lloyd
Wright’s Fallingwater into a single
shaft of light, completely ignoring
the impressiveness of the original
structure. Helene Binet has more
success with her studies of Daniel
Liebskind’s Jewish Museum; but then
again, it is near impossible to take a
poor photo of a building steeped in
such deconstructivist drama.
Luckily, we also have a selection
of Hiroshi Sugimoto’s work; by far
the best conceptual work in the
gallery, Sugimoto reduces famous
buildings down to a mere black and
white impression, obscured and out
of focus, as though viewed through
a thick fog. Rather than reducing
the impact these building have, this
instead highlights the architect’s
original intentions when it comes to
form and shape.
Ed Ruscha and Stephen Shore
provide a much needed hit of wry
humour with their work, which
explored the unsettling banality of
everyday America. In Ruscha’s case,
this translates to vast photographs
of car parks, taken from helicopter,
the repetitive blocks building up a
pattern on the ground; a modern day
shopping-mall Nazca. Shore’s work
centres around small towns in the
American South, which could easily
all be called Uncanny Valley, and
highlight the mundane. Underneath
the bright, saturated colours, lies an
air of menace, as if Twin Peaks had
been relocated to Texas.
"Nadav
Kander's
exploration
of urban
growth is
both awe-
inspiring
and
horrific"
Towards the second half of the
exhibition, the focus broadens in
scope, moving away from America,
instead looking towards the new
megacities springing up in Asia,
Africa, and South America. Guy
Tillim’s exploration of modernist
urban decay in Southern Africa –
named Avenue Patrice Lumumba,
after the murdered Congolese
politician – is particularly interesting,
showing us a view of Africa that is far
from typical. Sadly the same cannot
be said for Simon Norfolk, whose
series Chronotropia and Burke Norfolk
portray Afghanistan as largely a land
of terror and ruined buildings, a
rhetoric spouted on a near daily basis
in any national newspaper.
A highlight is the work of Nadav
Kander, whose exploration of urban
growth and massive construction
along the Yangtze River in China
is both awe-inspiring and horrific.
A mighty river, which once ran
turbulently for nearly 4000
miles, is now placid, thanks to the
construction of the Three Gorges
Dam during the late 1990s; as
enormous bridges are erected in the
background families sit and picnic
on the banks; fishermen haul in their
catch, seemingly oblivious to the high
levels of pollution and industrial
run-off.
The task of curating a retrospective
on the link between photographers
and architects was always going to
be difficult, and Pardo and Redstone
have done well to select just 18
artists. While the quality and depth
of the work displayed somewhat
varies – with a strong North
American start gives way to a more
scattered international reach – the
exhibition is unmissable for anyone
with even a scant interest in either
medium. What with the Barbican’s
architectural beauty (although some
would contest this), there is hardly a
more perfect place for a study of this
most natural of relationships.

Romance and Ruins at the Royal Academy
Anselm Kiefer is not an
artist to approach in half
measures. When I read
that, in 1992, he turned his 35 acre
studio in Barjac, France, into a giant
Gesamtkunstwerk comprised of
storerooms, installations, paintings,
underground chambers, corridors,
striking glass structures and huge
lead sculptures, I thought that maybe,
in the pretty, well presented halls of
the Royal Academy of Art (RAA), a
certain undertone of Kiefer’s work
may well be lost on me. It wasn’t.
Even without the magnificent
structures in which Kiefer originally
presented his works, the full spectrum
of Kiefer’s creations do not fail to
completely shock and awe its audi-
ence with horrific, twisted motifs and
dark philosophical stories, creating an
overwhelmingly powerful critique of
Kiefer’s chosen subjects.
In this first major retrospective
of Kiefer’s work, the RA has
collaborated closely with the artist
to present some of his most famous
works, alongside installations created
specifically for this show, and some of
his lesser known works in books and
watercolours.
A truly spectacular experience, this
retrospective beautifully presents
the full breadth of Kiefer’s work and
shows the intricate and philosophical
development of his inspirations and
motifs over the years in an intelligent
and powerful exhibition.
Curated by Kathleen Soriano, the
show is largely chronological and
opens with Kiefer’s earliest work in
the late 1960s while he was studying
under the realist Peter Dreher.
Right from the get go, the
exhibition’s vision and purpose is
clear and almost each piece links in
beautifully with the next. Almost
poetically, Kiefer stays faithful to
a handful of motifs which crop
up in almost all his work. Two of
these motifs explored in particular
detail are the German forests and
Germany’s Nazi past, present in both
his oldest and newest works.
In Kiefer’s series of paintings Heroic
Symbols (Heroische Sinnbilder),
Kiefer depicts himself in a typical
German landscape performing the
Sieg Heil alongside classical figures,
drawn from Nazi Propaganda.
Originally produced as his
final exam piece while studying
in Karlsruhe, the piece shocked
the establishment then and still
provokes an extreme emotional
response in some who see it. The
collective lack of consciousness that
had befallen Germany is directly
confronted in this series and remains
just as relevant now as a critique of
nationalist movements.
As is often the case with artists
who radically confront such difficult
issues, Kiefer’s earlier years saw him
frequently labelled as an anti-Semite.
For the 1980 Venice Biennale, Kiefer
first presented his painting The
Paths of World Wisdom: Hermann’s
Battle. On a dark textured forest
background, Kiefer has pasted the
black and white images of people
depicted in Nazi Propaganda,
surrounding a small white fire. Based
on the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest
where Germanic tribes defeated
the Roman legions, Kiefer’s work
addresses the birth of German
nationalism and the ground on which
German traditions were built, with
the fire expressing the opportunity
for the rebirth of a nation.
Dark and overwhelming, the
painting draws on the darker side
of German history and directly
confronts the silent Germany of
Kiefer’s childhood. This general
feeling runs through the whole
exhibition and leaves you in complete
awe by the end.
Up to this point I’ve only really
spoken about Kiefer’s earlier work,
and since talking about specific
paintings or sculptures never quite
satisfies what I want to say about
a piece, I will leave you with one
last observation. The week before
the exhibition opened to the press,
Anselm Kiefer came to the RAA
and set out to produce a sculpture
specifically for this exhibition.
Ages of the World is a story about
man’s inability to comprehend
geological time, the romantic
aspirations of art, and the poetry of
ruins. Constructed from dozens of
broken Kiefer Canvasses, photos from
his past work, and lead structures,

Max Falkenberg explores Anslem Kiefer’s enduring influence
"Dark &
overwhelm-
ing, [it]
confronts
Kiefer's
Germany"
"Its vision
and
purpose
is clear...
each piece
links in
beautifully
with the
next"
the artwork encompasses the whole
room in which it has been created and
touches on the frailty of Earth in the
Universe.
Kiefer’s obsession with the cyclical
nature of time and the idea that
science can answer everything and
nothing can be seen throughout every
crevice of this monstrous creation.
The lead mushrooms again draw on
the idea of the rebirth of a ruined
Earth with Kiefer having stated
often in the past that lead is the only
substance which can hold the weight
of human history.
Together these elements join to
create a sculpture which not only
draws in the audience but leaves them
completely mesmerised, and this
happens over and over again in this
exhibition.
Every artwork in this retrospective
seems to fit perfectly in its
surroundings and as a whole, the
exhibition tells a beautiful story.
Whether you like Kiefer’s work or
not, he is undoubtedly now one of the
world’s greatest living artists.
