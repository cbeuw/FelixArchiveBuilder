Tripping on acid – not just for hippies?
Lauren Ratcliffe takes a look at the latest LSD research at Imperial
Dr Robin Carhart-Harris and
Professor David Nutt, along-
side other researchers at Im-
perial College University, are tread-
ing on relatively unknown territory
and breaking long-held preconcep-
tions about the therapeutic potential
of Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
to treat patients with mood disorders
and addictions.
The 50s and 60s was a golden era
for LSD research, with a total of
1,000 academic paper investigations
into its effects on a total of 40,000
people by the mid-1960s. However,
LSD research plummeted after the
introduction of the UK Misuse of
Drugs Act in 1971, the start of the
governmental campaign for the
outright ban of drugs in an attempt
to tackle illegal trade, and arguably
one of the most spectacularly
misinformed and failed policies ever
introduced given on-going debate
as to the effectiveness of outright
prohibition.
Under the UK Misuse of Drugs
Act LSD is a Class A drug, giving
it a foreboding reputation that
is more the result of a historical
misdemeanour rather than a true
calculation of the drug’s relative
risks. Now, Carhart-Harris is set
on breaking this 50-year taboo
surrounding the use of psychedelics
in research and is the first person
in the UK since 1971 to have legally
administered (albeit very minute)
doses of LSD to 10 human volunteers.
This recent study conducted various
imagery tests on the volunteers
whilst tripping on acid to test the
effect of LSD on suggestibility.
The theory goes that acid puts the
brain in a more supple state of mind,
with room for manipulation and
a higher susceptibility for change.
“Depression and addictions rest on
reinforced patterns of brain activity,
and a psychedelic will introduce
relative chaos… new things can be
learnt and at the same time old
things can be unlearnt”, explains Dr
Carhart-Harris.
The team of researchers are
following a more logical and
cautious methodology compared to
the hit-and-miss approach to LSD
research pre-1960s and have had
promising results which indicate
that the influence of suggestion is
enhanced by LSD, especially amongst
volunteers with more conscientious
and organised personality traits.
Professor David Nutt in his book
Drugs – Without the Hot Air (a must
read if you haven’t already) even
suggests that more scientists should
try psychedelics as a tool for finding
solutions to difficult problems by
looking at them from a different
perspective.
Which is not as shocking a
suggestion as it may first seem
considering that back in the 1950s
Francis Crick, along with co-
researcher James Watson, were both
under the influence of LSD when they
made their discovery of the double-
helix structure and that led to the
path of modern genetics. However,
Dr Carhart-Harris also remarks on
the dangers with psychedelics when

Despite funding setbacks, Dr
Carhart-Harris continues to carry
out pioneering research into
PHYSICS
The Nobel Prize in Physics for this
year has been jointly awarded to
Isamu Akasaki,Hiroshi Amano
and Shuji Nakamura for their
invention of the blue light emitting
diode (LED),which can generate
more energy-efficient white light
to illuminate houses,offices and
even billboards.A relatively new
invention discovered less than 20
years ago,blue LEDs are so efficient
that if we switched over to this type
of lighting it has been forecasted
to cut down the UK’s electricity bill
by 10%.That been said,this year’s
Nobel Prize in physics is definitely
more of an invention-based prize
rather than the usual discovery-
based prize.
MEDICINE
The Nobel Prize in Medicine
has been awarded to British-US
scientist John O’Keefe and married
couple May-Britt and Edvard
Moser from Norway for their work
and contribution to neuroscience
research.The prize was awarded
for work in underpinning particular
cells in the brain called“place
cells”and“grid cells”.These
specific cells act as an inner GPS
making it possible for our brain to
indentify where we are by firing
neurotransmitters that are specific
to a particular environment.It has
been said that these findings will
be particularly useful to understand
the mechanism of spatial memory
loss in Alzheimer’s patients.
CHEMISTRY
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was
awarded to three scientists: Eric
Betzig,Stefan Hell and William
Moerner.Together they harnessed
the fluorescence of molecules
in order to monitor individual
molecules within living cells.
Dubbed the‘nanoscope’,this new
technology has enabled scientists
to study molecules smaller than
0.2 micrometres,a scale previously
off limits to researchers.This
new breakthrough will have a
major role to play in the studies of
disease related molecules as well
as enabling researchers to witness
events such as cell division at scales
much smaller than previously
possible.
