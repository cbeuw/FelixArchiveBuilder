Or, if you are feeling brave,
come and say hi to us in the
Felix Office, based in the west
basement of Beit Quad.
Some of you more seasoned
readers of Felix may remember
that usually Felix is published
on a Friday, and appears bright
and early(ish) for your end of week
lectures. And yet here we are, Monday
morning (potentially wet, although
I hope the weather stays dry for
tomorrow, I hate delivering papers
in the rain), with a new Felix around
campus. What gives?
This is actually the first issue of
Felix to have been borne from our
completely new office. Nestled away
at the back of the West Basement,
this “Newspaper Office” as it has
been branded by the Union, is now
our permanent home. We have
already moved in, put posters up on
the walls, littered the floors with cof-
fee cups and used it as an impromptu
changing room.
However, just like Rome, the West
Basement refurbishment didn’t hap-
pen in a day. It didn’t even happen in
a month, but has taken the best part
of this last year to complete. Even
on Friday, as we had our first team
of excited section editors in to lay
out the pages, contractors were still
putting up blinds and messing with
cables.
This issue almost didn’t happen
too. At one point we decided to miss
out this issue, and power through
into next Friday, restore ourselves
back to our usual routine and take
a well-deserved break after the first
issue that nearly killed our team. Ap-
parently, making a paper using only
one computer without an office is a
nightmare. Who knew?
But after an inebriated Alex Savell
stumbled down to the office just un-
der a week ago now, and convinced
me that skipping an issue is a stupid
idea, we were back on track. Savell
stumbled away, and I hastily pinged
emails out to everyone, calling them
to arms (or rather, to Issue 1583).
We even managed to visit a few
balls, interview a few celebrities, and
make a few new friends at Freshers’
Fair at our very first meet and greet.
We’ve welcomed a host of new sec-
tion editors, writers and copy editors
to our team, which is exciting!
Our new home would have been
impossible to inhabit if it wasn’t
for the great work of the students
who have spent the last few weeks
down here in the basement, set-
ting everything up. Massive thanks
to Max Hunter, George Butcher,
Luke Granger-Brown, Cem Hurrell,
Henry Whittaker, Philip Kent, Ethan
Haley and everyone else who has
come down and sat soldering, mov-
ing boxes, unpacking hundreds of
records and CDs and everything else
that needed to be done to get in here
on time.
It’s been a crazy fortnight and we
can’t rest yet: Felix will be going to
print twice this week. We are out
today, on Monday, and if all goes to
plan again on Friday. Don’t say we
never do anything for you guys
Enjoy this issue, be gentle if you
spot some last minute errors, and let
us know how you think we did. In
the meantime, send coffee donations
to the basement, as once this issue
hits the stands, we are straight back
into the office to make another.
