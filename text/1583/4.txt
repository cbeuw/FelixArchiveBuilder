Imperial students attend Hong Kong protest
Agroup of Imperial students,
mostly from Hong Kong,
have been challenging the
preconception that Imperial is
politically apathetic by taking part in
the protests that have struck the city
in recent weeks.
When Hong Kong was returned
to Beijing’s control in 1997, there
as an agreement that a high degree
of autonomy would be retained for
at least fifty years, and it was hoped
that this would involve free elections
for the post of Hong Kong Chief
Executive in 2017.
However, the Chinese Government
has stated that it will vet candidates
before the election, only allowing
two or three candidates whose views
are in line with those of the People’s
Republic Government. Protesters
claim that this is a violation of
previous agreements, and have
launched protest actions in cities
across the world to raise international
awareness of what they say is
evidence of the government riding
roughshod over the people’s wishes.
As well as the Occupy Central
protest in Hong Kong City,
supporters have organised action in
Singapore, London and Manchester.
Felix spoke to some of the Imperial
students protesting in Hong Kong, as
well as members of HK Pass, a Union
Club that is run by students from
Hong Kong that promotes awareness
of Public Issues and Community Students protesting in front of the Chinese Embassy in London Photo: Ben Fernando

Service.
Jo Leung and Brian Yeung are two
such students, both from second year.
They explained to Felix that they
were outside the Chinese Embassy
in Portland Square on Tuesday
night to “support the advancement
of democracy, the right of people to
speak up and to freely express their
views”, though wanted to be clear that
these were their own views and not
those of HK Pass.
The protest itself was far larger
than expected, with organisers
estimating that over 3,000 people,
mostly students, had shown up to
stage a sit-in whilst various speakers
made announcements about what
they were doing and how democracy
in Hong Kong needed to be
developed.
Although the largely peaceful
protest attracted a fair amount of
attention on social media, some of
the protesters were under no illusion
about the effect that this would have
on the Chinese government, noting
that they were likely to play it down
or perhaps pretend that it had never
happened.
There appeared to be no shortage
of people at the protest who were
not ethnically Chinese, suggesting
that the reach of the ‘Umbrella
Movement’ as it has come to be called
is growing.
It will be interesting to see how the
situation in Hong Kong develops.
The annual extravoganza of Freshers’Fair took over the
entirity of the South Kensington campus last Tuesday,
and,despite weather forcasts warning otherwise,
remained dry for most of the day.
Over 330 clubs are thought to have taken part in the
day,alongside the Queen’s Tower Room playing host
to a number of external stalls,and it is thought that
over 2 billion email addresses were taken down from
overeager freshers hoping to try everything new in
a bid to get involved–this may be a lie.Only 22% of
these were estimated to be hotmail addresses and of
these,only 4% of these were thought to be misspelt or
containing multiple underscores or the number“69.”
(again this may be a lie).
The day,organised by Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies) Abi de Bruin went very smoothly.The only
hitch was for the RCSU who had their mascot,Theta,
stolen by a group from the CGCU lead by Sam Oxley
and Pari Singh.James Badman,the sole defender of
the 60kg of aluminium themometer at the time of
its theft,was seen sporting a sling but still managed
to put on a brave face whilst giving out thousands of
pounds worth of freebies afterwards.
Theta has now been returned to the RCSU after they
paid the ransom demands.

"The
ambulance
didn't
move for
a good
twenty
minutes,
and we
took an
almost
leisurely
drive to the
hospital."
"The
situation
was
handled
in an
exemplary
manner,
such that
the welfare
of the
student was
protected."
Imperial College Medics hit the
headlines this week after The
Evening Standard reported on a
first year student being drunk during
a boat party, forcing the boat to moor
early and hand the student over to
paramedics. The article, “Lifeboat
crews warn Thames revellers over
safety after student passes out on
freshers' week pirate party boat,” was
published the following day.
It is uncertain as to why the
story was picked up by the Evening
Standard, although it is thought
to have come to the attention of
journalists via the Twitter account of
a coastguard.
The President, alongside other
Union representatives and members
of staff, were contacted via a vague
email from the Standard the
following day.
The email wanted to speak to
someone about “the welfare of
students at a freshers’ event.” The
subject of the email was simply
“ Story” and no-one from the Medic’s
Union representatives responded.
The boat party, held last Monday
evening on the Thames in central
London, was organised by the
entertainment team within Imperial
College School of Medicine Student’s
Union (ICSMSU). Around 375 people
were on the boat at the time.
The Evening Standard reported that
the student in question was found
"almost unconscious" and only "mildly
responsive to pain.”
Felix spoke to Dariush
Hassanzadeh-Baboli, ICSMSU
president, and Jennifer Watson, the
ICSMSU Welfare Officer. Both were
present on the boat on the night of
the incident.
They told us that it was quite late
into the night when the student
started experiencing difficulties, and
was throwing up over the side of the
boat.
Despite the best efforts of the
ICSMSU team, the boat staff
intervened. “The boat staff came
over and ask what is going on, and
we wanted to put [the student] in
the recovery position… but the boat
people basically said no. They asked
the student to sit on a chair inside
instead.”
Upon the Captain deciding to
return the boat to shore prematurely,
staff called ahead to order an
ambulance. However, Watson
thought this was unnecessary, and
told us that the article exaggerated
what followed. “The Evening Standard
said she was taken in as priority, but
the ambulance was [at the dock] for a
really long time. They just kept an eye
on her pulse and her stats.”
“The ambulance didn’t move for a
good twenty minutes, and we took an
almost leisurely drive to the hospital.
They didn’t use sirens or anything. It
was easily a good 45 minutes or more
between getting off the boat and being
put into a bed in hospital.”
Watson continued, “She had little
experience drinking and hadn’t
actually drunk that much at all. She
just hadn’t known her limits. The next
morning she felt a bit rough, she had a
bit of a headache and was fine.”
So what did they think of the
coverage?
Dariush said, “A lot of publications
like student bashing as they have
nothing else to write. I also find it
really odd that the police are tweeting
stuff like this.”
Watson added, “That article did
nothing but bash students, they did
nothing to mention the [Medics’] SU’s
efforts.” Dariush continued, “On the
whole, the Faculty of Medicine were
happy with the way we dealt with it.
We didn’t offer any free drink tokens.
Essentially it is the licence holder that
is responsible.”
With alcohol banned from being
brought onto the boat from outside,
Dariush stressed that “It is very
possible what she drank came from
the boat’s bar. At the end of the day,
when a dangerous substance is legal,
and is unregulated, we can’t control
what people do.”
The story, reminiscent of the 2011
coverage by the Daily Mail of a (then)
typical Sport’s night at Reynolds bar
which attracted a lot of attention, and
triggered a debate over the behaviour
of students, drinking during the
beginning of term and also the
behaviour of Medical Students in
general.
The 2011 coverage resulted in the
banning of use of jugs to serve alcohol
in the bar, alongside the removal of
orange buckets usually placed around
the venue in case a student should
become unwell.
Unruly behaviour on boat parties
is not uncommon either; one boat
party organised by the Royal College
Science Union (RCSU) back in 2012
was terminated early as a table was
thrown into the river. The boat
also had to return back to the shore
around half an hour after it initially
departed to put an inebriated student
back on shore. As far as Felix is aware,
this story did not hit the national
headlines.
Regardless as to why this particular
story has been published, the fact that
it is in the media could exasperate the
repercussions of the incident.
Dariush refused to comment
on whether or not the Faculty
of Medicine is responding to the
incident, although they confirm that
if the story hadn’t got into the press,
no-one would have found out about
what had happened. Said Watson, “In
my head, it is not a big deal. As a one
off, you can’t rule out her drink was
spiked. Most Medic Freshers’ will get
into that state in their first year.”
“I don’t think it is a Fitness to
Practice issue, as getting drunk and
passing out once is not uncommon.”
“The only reason she went to
hospital was because the boat staff
called the ambulance. She would have
been just as fine if she had taken a cab
back to halls.”
The Faculty of Medicine doesn’t
know the identity of the student
involved, and Watson said that she
wouldn’t be telling them anyway. “I’m
bound by confidentiality.”
Deputy President (Welfare)
Christopher Kaye spoke to Felix and
stated his displeasure in such a “non-
story” hitting the headlines. “It doesn’t
highlight any underlying problems.
The situation was handled in an
exemplary manner, such that the
welfare of the student was protected.”
“The only lapse in judgement came
from the Evening Standard reporting
on the matter.”
“The student shouldn’t beat him/
herself up too much. We’ve all been in
a similar situation at some point, but
we’re not all unfortunate enough to
end up on a boat when it happens.”
Will there be a boat party in the
future? Dariush finished, “I don’t see
why not. We will review Freshers’
Fortnight, which we do anyway,
and will always put the relevant
precautions in place to make sure our
students are kept safe.”
