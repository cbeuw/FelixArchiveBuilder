Alex Savell,
Deputy
President
(Finance and
Services)
talks bars,
burritos and
what he really
thought of his
predecessor
Bernedett Tildy interviews
the man behind the money
“I’m a
massive
nerd,
I like sci-fi
and riding
horses.”
Bernadett: What’s your academic
background?
Alex: I started at Imperial in 2006,
doing Physics. I did the 4 year course,
then I did my MRes in 2010/11. And
since then, I’ve been doing my PhD.
B: Where are you from, and how
has it affected your outlook on
Imperial?
A: I’m from Bath. Yeah, I think
it did influence my outlook on
Imperial. It’s quite a posh little town.
The culture shock was somewhat less:
the booze price increase when moving
to London was less pronounced…
However, the change in diversity
was large and experiencing different
cultures coming together in London
was great.
B: Do you think the international
aspect of Imperial is sufficiently
represented in the Union?
A: We obviously try and represent
everyone, but I don’t think
engagement with international
students is good enough. The sabb
team is usually white British, and
that’s not what we are as a student
population, so it’d be good to improve
it. How we’d go about doing that is an
interesting question.
B: How are you going to be held
accountable at the end of this year?
A: We’re asking Union Council to
be far more critical of us, to give us
stronger feedback and more scrutiny.
B: I've been told that the sabb
hierarchy has recently changed. Is
the President no longer the boss of
the other sabbs?
A: Yeah, now there is a more
equal, democratic structure. Tom
still chairs things, but he isn’t our
boss. The President also maintains
responsibility.
B: Abi, the DPCS works with non-
sabbs, do you?
A: I probably work less closely with
them than she does, but they are
there as a point of advice, and staff
members generally make sure we’re
asking the right sort of questions. I
also get to work with the commercial
services and the finance team. A lot
of what I do now is sorting clubs’
problems regarding finances.
B: Do you know how you're going
to achieve the main policies you
said you wanted to achieve?
A: My policies were: clubs and
society policy review - which we’ve
started, more light music in metric,
and postgraduate engagement in
H-bar. But right now, sorting out
Welcome week for Freshers is our
main priority.
B: Are you actually busy? What
do you do day to day?
A: Yeah! I get 50-60 emails a day!
And I thought summer was supposed
to be relatively free! Replying to the
requests takes a long time, it’s very
hard to clear some time in a day to
achieve the things I set out to change.
I tend to work 10-6pm-ish, but there
have been days where I’ve done more
(9-7pm).
Yeah, most of my time is eaten
up answering emails and going to
meetings. I’m currently looking at
is what stance College will take on
Higher Education fees.
B: Do you think Kieron did a
good job last year?
A: No comment, it’s hard to tell.
You get a very different perspective
when you’re doing the job itself and
that’s going to change in term time
as well.
I think there are things he did
well and some he didn’t, I know
sometimes he wasn’t the easiest
person to get along with.
But I know that I have similar
problems, I am trying really hard to
not piss anyone off. It’s really hard
to say: I can see how it’s easy to just
adequately get through what’s on
your plate that day and not achieve
anything else. It’s hard to judge
someone.
With DPFS, positive changes aren’t
that visible to others, stuff just goes
slightly faster or transactions are
slightly more secure.
If I achieve anything positive,
chances are no one will notice at all
or the net benefit will come in one or
two years down the line.
It’s the danger of being a sabb: your
positive changes aren’t immediately
visible.
B: Why did you run for a
sabbatical position?
A: The Union has been my
favourite aspect of Imperial. I’ve been
involved in clubs and societies from
my first year. I’ve enjoyed seeing
how things have worked and having
influence over how things work. I’ve
found some aspects frustrating and I
wanted to come in and improve it.
B: How come you only considered
it after so many years at Imperial?
A: I considered it before, I just
never felt it was the right moment. I’d
been on other boards in the Union,
but I wanted more experience before
becoming a sabb. This year was
theoretically the last year I could have
ran in the elections.
B: What are you going to do next
year?
A: Finish my Phd, then get a proper
job!
B: What do you think about
Chris donating a third of his wage?
A: Has he actually done it?
B: Yeah!
A: Oh really?! It’s very noble. I think
it’s a good cause. I personally don’t
think that I would do the same. It
maybe makes me a worse person! But
it does highlight a debate we should
have. We are forced to do a lot more
work that some other student unions.
And Imperial grads are some of the
highest paid graduates in the world,
so you need something to to attract
people to do another year at the
Union.
So we can’t necessarily compare
ourselves to other student unions,
without at least baring that in mind.
He’s doing it for the message that
sabbs are overpaid, but I don’t think
that’s true, but he’s doing a nice thing
for donating.
B: You said you liked the Union
as a young student, but there
anything you dislike about the
Union?
A: Yeah, there are plenty of things
which are frustrating, especially how
long it takes for things to get done
as a club officer. There is a lot more
to be done. Everything if I didn’t
think there were things I didn’t like, I
wouldn’t have ran for a sabb position.
I’d love to see the bar play music
every night.
B: Okay, I have some fun
questions!
A: Oh thank you, I must sound like
the most boring person ever!
B: What’s your biggest online
timewaster?
A: Oh that’s difficult, I’ve got lots of
them. I’ve been good though, I haven’t
been on Facebook that much lately! I
spend a lot of time on GPRO, which is
an online racing management game.
In terms of websites, my favourite
one is Neko the Kitty.
B: If you were trapped on a desert
island with the other Sabbs, who do
you think you would collectively
eat first?
A: I’m not sure we’d reach a
collective decision! I think we’d all try
and kill each other!
B: Who do you think would be
the last person to survive?
A: Me! Nah, I think we would
probably gang up on the medic
president, Dariush.
B: If you had to have tinder, what
bio would you have?
A: I’ve never thought about it, I
don’t have tinder. Playing on other
people’s tinder it is fun though.
I’d probably include that I’m
massive nerd, I like sci-fi and riding
horses.
B: If you had to have a first date
on campus because you were so
busy with all your sabb duties,
which Imperial establishment
would you go to?
A: It depends on the person. I don’t
think I should say a College venue,
because the commercial services
staff will hate me. But never mind:
Eastside bar!
B: Can you recommend any
places or any places to avoid?
A: I’m in charge of Metric, I have to
say Metric!
B: Oh come on, not an Imperial
one!
A: Electric Ballroom in Camden.
We went to the Ultimate Power night
there a few weeks ago. It’s like goth-
cheese, ie: very cheesy goth music.
B: If you had to eat one meal
from 568 for the rest of your life,
what would it be?
A: Probably the burrito! Better than
expected.
B: Favourite alcoholic drink?
A: Amaretto.
B: If you were allowed to name a
Union drinking hall, what would
you name it? Can you think of a
pun quick enough?!
A: I would probably turn them
back into what they used to be called!
I can’t think of one now, but I still
think my suggestion of ICUtube is
better than STOIC’s change to ICTV!
" B: Do
you think
Kieron did
a good job
last year?
A: No
comment."
"A lot of
what I do
now is
sorting
clubs
problems
regarding
finances."
"I am
trying
really
hard to
not piss
anyone
off."
"I still
