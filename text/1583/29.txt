Nonogram Cat Sudoku
Each row and column must consist of a series of shaded and unshaded boxes.The number
of shaded boxes is mentioned beside and above each row and column (e.g.1,2,...might
mean some unshaded boxes,1 shaded box,some more unshaded,2 shaded,and so on).
Solve the puzzle to reveal a pretty picture or a coded message.
Just like a normal Sudoku,but with cats instead of numbers.You might say the cat had
9 lives,in fact! Each row,column,and 3 by 3 square must contain every one of the catâ€™s 9
postures.Good luck,and happy doodling!
