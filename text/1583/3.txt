Imperial academic Dr Sean
Barrett’s inquest finally came
to a close earlier this week. Dr.
Barrett’s death occurred in Perth,
Australia in 2012, however legal
proceedings and the need to transfer
documents to England had delayed
the outcome up until now.
A post-mortem into the death of Dr.
Sean Barrett, a former academic at
Imperial College London, concluded
last Monday in Manchester.
Dr. Barrett died following a “non-
survivable” car crash caused by Mr
Antony Fogarty – described as being
“high on cannabis and amphetamine”
– was jumping multiple red lights at
100mph and drove straight into the
taxi being used by the academic.
Coroner Fiona Borrill recorded
a conclusion of unlawful killing,
saying the risk of death was “almost
inevitable” when Fogarty got behind
the wheel.
Borrill said: “This must have been
a tragic loss of a very special person
who had a massive amount to give
and so much more to achieve.”
Dr. Barrett’s mother condemned
Fogarty, calling him a ‘monster.’
“He could have got 22 years to life
yet he only got 11. I don't understand
it. He killed two people. It was two
counts of manslaughter but he will
out in no time unless somebody
blocks his parole. He will come out
and kill somebody else.”
“They thought he would have gone
on to win a Nobel Prize. The fact he
had been awarded a Royal Society
fellowship allowed him to do what he
wanted to do. He had a brilliant mind
and he was a special person.”
Fogarty, was noted to not posses a
Western Australian driving license,
and has a history of drug addiction.
The car he was driving was stolen,
and he had previously jumped two
red lights before hitting the taxi Dr.
Barrett was riding in.
Mr. Fogarty was jailed in 2013
for 11 years, pleading guilty to two
counts of manslaughter. A second
man, Kuldeep Singh, was also killed
having shared the cab journey to the
city centre from the airport with Dr.
Barrett.
Dr. Barrett was a distinguished
academic at Imperial, having been
awarded a Royal Society Fellowship.
His research was in the fields of
quantum physics and quantum
computing, and he also taught a
popular postgraduate course in the
Centre for Controlled Quantum
Dynamics.
“Over his career Sean demonstrated
an extraordinary versatility in
understanding deeply the physics
of very different physical systems
including quantum dots, cavity
quantum electrodynamics, trapped
atoms and ions, superconducting
qubits and nonlinear optics.” Said
colleagues Professor Myungshik Kim
and Dr Terry Rudolph in 2012.
“Working with Sean was a joy. He
organised Wednesday breakfast
meetings for the Controlled Quantum
Dynamics Group for two years, and
his hugely charismatic personality
was a crucial part of their success.
“Sean cared deeply about the careers
of his graduate students and those
he taught. He was an energetic,
extremely clear and pedagogical
lecturer, and we have heard many
stories from people he greatly
inspired.”
“We will miss Sean’s humour, his
reliability, his basic ‘mateship’ and
his fundamental decency as a human
being.”
Inquest into death of Imperial
academic comes to a close

While separate, the remit of both
reports is largely complementary,
though there is overlap in the
recommendations made with regards
to general management and strategic
work at Imperial.
In a statement released by College
concerning the news, Provost and
Establishment Licence holder
Professor James Stirling said: “We
welcome the publication of the report
about this extensive Home Office
investigation, which shows that the
vast majority of the allegations made
against Imperial by BUAV have not
been substantiated.
“We are pleased that the
investigation recognises the quality
of care provided by our staff and the
work of our researchers in refining
procedures where possible.”
“We recognise that there have
been problems with the culture and
management around our animal
research.”
“We are sorry for these
shortcomings and we have addressed
them through considerable efforts
and investment in our animal
research infrastructure, to improve
our culture of care and to ensure that
we meet the very highest standards in
our animal research.”
Reynolds appoints first full-time manager
Reynolds bar,described by the
Union as“the heart of the Imperial
College School of Medicine”,has
hired a new full time bar manager.
Carl Salton-Cox,the new manager,
was hired following an advert
on the Union website for a new
Reynolds manager at the beginning
of the Summer break.Having
previously worked as a student
bar manager,operations officer
and assistant venue manager at
the University of Sussex Students’
Union,it is hoped that he has the
experience to see both sides of
situations and improve profitability
in keeping with what the Medics
and other students want.
The Union declined to arrange an
interveiw with Carl for Felix,instead
they offered an interview with Alex
Savell,Deputy President (Finance &
Services).
On interviewing,Alex Savell
explained that the idea is to make
Reynolds a sustainable bar is still
here in 20-30 years.
Referencing the recent incident
involving an ICSM boat party,Alex
acknowledged the need for change.
“I certainly hope that the nature
of the media coverage we get is
going to change.I think there’s
gonna[sic] have to be,slowly over
time,a change to make sure we don’t
get that kind of media coverage,
and that we are doing our duty to
protect…our students,particularly
our younger students.”
“Changes made at Reynolds will
not be instant,and will take place
in conjunction with ICSM Exec
and the existing bar staff.The new
management is there to ensure that
we keep access to Reynolds and the
use of the space.”
In terms of the changes to be
made,the Union is keen to make
sure that the Medics retain a stake in
the bar,and that it should not stop
being a loud and fun environment
to be in.It was also noted that the
more the bar makes,and the more
students to whom the bar caters,the
more likely it is that the space will
remain open.
Reynolds came under fire from
the Daily Mail in 2011,and was
likened to“a hostel for down-
and-out alcoholics”. The bar has a
reputation for raucous,uncontrolled
nights amongst students as well,
with“rank”being one of the kinder
descriptions used.
More widely across the Union,
Reynolds Bar fits into the spectrum
of Union-run bars with its own
branding and a character that is not
visibly associated with anything else
at the Union.The building of this
brand,without losing the sense of
ownership felt by the medics,puts
it alongside h-bar,which caters
exclusively to postgraduates and
staff.
The Union are currently hiring
casual duty managers for all three
Union venues to support the
permanent staff,with applications
welcome from students and non-
students alike.
Reynolds is open from 18:00 to
23:00 every weekday,and opens late
on Wednesdays and Fridays–the
first sports night of the year will
take place this coming Wednesday.
Carl was also unavailable to
comment on the management of
the vomit usually associated with
these events,but we here at Felix
would like to wish him the best of
luck with the new position.
