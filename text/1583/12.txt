BFI London Film Festival: Part 1
John Park takes you through the openings and closings of the LFF
"The spare
seats do
not hang
around for
long."
"London
Film
Festival is
an event
unlike any
other."
October is a dreary month.
Summer is officially over,
the sun will stop shining in
the afternoon, the holidays have
come to an end and it's back to work
for students, none of whom feel as
though they have had a long enough
break. But studying in a London
university has its perks for film fans,
as the British Film Institute’s (BFI)
annual London Film Festival (LFF) is
an event unlike any other.
Boasting a selection of more than
200 films from countries all over the
world, this year's LFF promises once
again to be a star-filled, jam-packed
12-day event, one that cannot be
missed for those interested in the
world of cinema.
The LFF has a long, distinguished
tradition of introducing to the public,
months before their official release
dates, quality films that then go on
to win all sorts of awards throughout
the months of the Oscar season.
Previous years have seen premieres
of 12 Years a Slave, The Artist, The
King's Speech and many more, all of
which were awarded the Best Picture
awards at the Oscars. London, armed
with a Leicester Square full of cinema
screens, is the place filmmakers and
actors descend upon, to promote their
work and build up the hype.
Public participation is a major part
of the festival, unlike many other
events that like to class themselves
as more prestigious, in which case it
is virtually impossible to get ahold
of tickets. The LFF opens booking
for members of the public and the
full programme is at your disposal.
But it is advisable to act quickly, as
tickets are of course limited, and
given the high level of anticipation
surrounding certain films (mostly
those that star the biggest names in
the industry), the spare seats do not
hang around for long.
So best of luck in getting your
hands on the tickets, and jump at the
opportunity to watch what will be
some of the best films of this year,
way ahead of anyone else in the
country.
The Imitation Game:
Opening Night Gala
The Festival officially kicks off in
Odeon Leicester Square on 8th
October with the European premiere
of The Imitation Game, starring the
nation's favourite Sherlock, Benedict
Cumberbatch, as Alan Turing, in a
biopic that highlights his work in
cracking Nazi Germany's Enigma
code during the Second World
War. Reception from Telluride and
Toronto Film Festivals has mostly
been positive although not exactly
ecstatic.
The film has already had its fair
share of controversy, notably the
casting of Keira Knightley as Turing's
one-time fiancée, with Knightley
being deemed too pretty by some,
whereas the film's alleged toning
down of Turing's homosexuality has
also been highlighted.
Fury: Closing Night Gala
Closing the festival is just as
important as opening it, and the
honour of the final night feature goes
to yet another film set during the
Second World War. Fury, the David
Ayer-directed World War II drama
starring Brad Pitt, will be having its
European premiere on 19th October.
Very little is known about the film's
quality as of yet, given how the film
is missing out on any festival action
prior to coming to London.
All we have to go on for now, is the
intense trailer that has been released,
understandably putting as much
emphasis and focus on Pitt and tank
action as possible. It has a similar vibe
to Lebanon, a rather excellent war film
also set primarily in a tank.
This week at Imperial Cinema

it too seriously and a genuinely
wonderful soundtrack,and you
come out withGuardians.If you’ve
seen it before,make sure to watch
for things in the background,there

third.

Godzilla
Director: Gareth Edwards
Screenplay: Max Borenstein,Dave
Callaham
Cast: Aaron Taylor-Johnson,
Elizabeth Olsen,Bryan Cranston
Sixty years after he was initially
created by Tomoyuki Tanaka,
Hollywood’s favourite kaiju is back
for his thirty-second film,and he’s
bigger than ever.
After the less-than-well-received
1998 version of the film,a reboot
had been on the cards for a while,
but it wasn’t until director Gareth
Edwards impressed the world with
his low budget flick Monsters that
he was brought in to finally get the
thing in production.
Whilst watching you can tell
that Edwards is a lover of monster
films.Though he gives you time
to get to know the characters,and
have some truly human moments,
he never forgets that most of the
people come to watch these sort
of films to watch giant monsters
destroy things and fight.And
with that he absolutely delivers.
There isn’t much in this world
more satisfying than watching a
300-metre-tall ancient monster
punch things in the face.
