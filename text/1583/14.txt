Guilia Gabrielli discusses the new shows hitting your screens this term
"If you see
a fellow
student
streaming
on level
4, don't
judge, he's
probably
just seek-
ing fast
broadband
and cheap
heating."
"Summer
really is
not the
season
to binge-
watch
anymore."
Summer 2014 will probably
not be remembered as one to
watch, or at least not as one for
TV watching. When I was young,
summers used to be an endless
series of screaming matches and
compromises so I could get to take
advantage of the warmest season
while still enjoying an unhealthy
amount of television. However, this
year it only took a couple of weeks to
realise that summer really is not the
season to binge-watch anymore.
Remember early July? We would
tune in to catch football matches
and tennis glories and, even better,
do so with a cold pint at the local
pub. With the English team’s hopes
being cut disappointingly short and
Andy Murray out of Wimbledon
before we’d even started to get the
Pimm’s out, it didn’t take long
for that excitement to disappear.
Soon it was evident that TV was as
much on holiday as we were, except
for property shows and countless
episodes of EastEnders. The States
faced a similar predicament,
submerging us with reality TV
shows such as Keeping up with the
Kardashians and America’s Next Top
Model, but evidently thinking that
nobody is going to be watching good
TV when there are iced teas to be
drunk and barbeques to be fired up.
There were some exceptions. In
July, Showtime brought back the
second series of the period drama
Masters of Sex, a shows so intense
and well-crafted it could rival Mad
Men if it wasn’t for the painfully
slow interactions between some
of the most emotionally repressed
characters in TV history.
June saw the return of HBO True
Blood‘s seventh season, for those
who didn’t already get put off by
werepanthers and vampire gods.
For those who like it short and
sweet, the show You’re the Worst
was maybe the most interesting
newcomer.
Following the love lives of two
disillusioned and maladjusted
twenty-somethings, the show pulls
off sex-jokes and hipster-bashing
remarks with surprising ability.
Eventually August came, signifying
the return of hit shows The Great
British Bake-off and Dr Who. With a
brand new Doctor and baked-Alaska
scandals that made us see the ugly
side of Mary Berry, these did not
disappoint, unlike the new Made in
Chelsea spin-off in New York City that
features the same SW7 youngsters,
who have given up cricket and cream
tea in favour of hot dogs and baseball
caps.
Fear not, however! Autumn is here
and it’s been a long time coming (and
I stress, in television terms alone).
With it comes the return of several
beloved series, as well as new ones to
look out for.
Tuesday nights (for the American
public, and only later for us Brits)
will become girls’ night in, with
Fox’s double whopper New Girl/The
Mindy Project. Although the first may
have exhausted its main character’s
relationship fuel, the second still has
a lot to give thanks to Mindy Kaling’s
brilliant writing.
On Wednesdays, the Dunphys are
back in Modern Family, which can be
consumed whenever and wherever
by anyone feeling a little homesick at
the start of the new term (although,
spoiler alert, nobody’s family is that
lovable). And if glitter and cowboy
boots are your thing, which they
really ought to be, watch out for the
new season of Nashville, coming back
after the ultimate cliffhanger finale.
As usual, Thursday nights are the
real deal, with all time favourites
such as Bones and The Vampire Diaries
returning, and although some may
argue that the producers of these
shows are milking the plots a little,
I’m sure many of you can’t wait.
Producer Shonda Rhimes, of Grey’s
Anatomy fame, is working hard this
year, providing us with the most
followed medical show on TV, even
after the departure of fan favourite
Dr Christina Yang, as well as coming
back with Scandal and brand new
series How to Get Away With Murder.
If the past is any indication, with
attractive and complicated main
characters, gripping moral dilemmas
and dirty secrets, we are sure How to
Get Away with Murder will become
everyone’s new TV obsession.
Another newcomer that will keep
us watching is Red Band Society. Its
characters are normal adolescents
off to discover adulthood and sex,
only difference is they are doing it
from the wings of a hospital, also
dealing with love and loss. The series
is a remake of a Spanish hit show
produced by Steven Spielberg for
American audiences and promising
to deal with teenage angst and drama
in a less preppy and stereotypical
manner than Glee. Other classics like
The Big Bang Theory, American Horror
Story and The Walking Dead are also
back to make keeping up with lectures
slightly less appealing.
Finally, if you, Fresher, thought
that your Imperial days would be full
of hard study sessions at the library
and challenging tutorials, don’t
worry: they will.
However, there is still plenty of TV
to be watched and fun to be had. And
remember, if you see a fellow student
streaming on Level 4, don’t judge, he’s
probably just seeking fast broadband
and cheap heating, long forgotten
since the days of student halls.
