LSE,the prestigious school of busi-
ness and humanities,has been in
the public eye this week after an
embarrassing incident involving its
Ruby club.
On Monday,members of the Uni-
versity’s Rugby Club handed out
offensive and sexist flyers at their
Freshers’Fair,which referred to
women as“mingers”,“sloppy birds”
and even“beast-like”women.
The seven page flyer largely
boasted about the society and the
social lives of its members,with
the aim of enticing the new cohort
of fresher’s to join the club.
The General Secretary of the LSE
Student’s Union,Nona Buckley-
Irvine,announced in a statement
on Tuesday that the club would

Loras Tyrell spins disks and melts hearts
at Freshers’ Ball
The 2014 Freshers’ Ball boasted
a headline act from an actor/
DJ Finn Jones, who is most
well known for playing the bisexual
Knight of Flowers, Ser Loras Tyrell
from Game of Thrones.
Just before his set started, Finn gave
some excellent fan service by coming
to the front of the stage to take selfies
with his admirers. One girl cheekily
poked Finn’s nose, to which he
replied playfully “You bitch! That’s
the only good part of me, and you’re
trying to flatten it.”
The set lasted a full hour and a half
because Finn stayed on well past his
scheduled time, probably to make up
for being slightly late. Upon leaving,
Finn stopped to chat to the students,
asking what they study and signed a
copy of “A Clash of Kings” for one.
Felix caught Finn as he was leaving
the Union and managed to sneak in a
few words before he left via taxi.
We asked him how Season 5 filming
is going, to which he replied that it
was going amazingly well. “I grew
this beard for filming actually. I
don’t actually know what happens to
my character beyond the books, but
I can tell you that Season 5 is very
different!”
He also told us how Kristian
Nairn, who plays Hodor, first got
him into DJ’ing. “I’ve always loved
music and I’ve always loved making
my own music but he got me into
[professional DJ’ing]. I’ve been doing
a lot of tours around the UK and
playing in clubs around London too.”
Hodor was unavailable for
comment.
be disbanded for the full academic
year,following the distribution of
the flyers.
Ms.Buckley-Irvine has said of
the decision that“after considered
deliberation and a wide investiga-
tion,LSE Men’s Rugby Club will
be disbanded for the rest of the
academic year and not be allowed to
represent LSE or LSESU.They will be
withdrawn from any competitions
already entered into.”
The flyer made a number of outra-
geous references about women who
play sports,referring to those who
play hockey,netball and rugby as
“beast-like women who play sport
so that they can come out with us on
Wednesdays.”It also referred to zoo
bar,a venue the society regularly fre-
quents,as a place where“nowhere in
the world can so many mingers look
so appealing.”
The flyer does not stop at making
sexist remarks; it also goes so far as
to boast its superiority over fellow
London University,King’s College
London.The flyer refers to the Uni-
versity as the“Strand Polytechnic”,
claiming that“they are scum and
they will all work for us one day”.
The statement by Ms.Buckley-Ir-
vine took the derogatory references
to King’s College very seriously,
saying that“This snobbery towards
students from other Universities is
unacceptable”and that the society’s
attitudes of“elitism”and“classicism”
were inexcusable.
Although the Club released a
statement of apology for the flyers,
saying that its members had“a lot
to learn about the pernicious effects
of banter”,it seems that this was not
enough to appease the wider LSE
community and the student’s union.
The LSE Student’s Union chose to
disband the Society after none of its
members took responsibility for any
of the comments made in the flyer,
and thus responsibility fell on all the
members as well as the society as a
whole.
On Wednesday,the LSE Athletics
Union released a statement on the
disbandment of the Men’s Rugby
Club,saying that the decision“shows
that the Student’s Union are refus-
ing to tackle the issues of misogyny,
racism,sexism and homophobia in a
productive and proactive manner.”
One could argue that the ac-
tions of the Student’s Union were
merely a way of brushing the issue
under the carpet and ignoring it,
but Imperial College Union would
also take on a similar stance if
faced with a similar issue.
The Union president,Tom
Wheeler,has said in a statement
“I believe that the disregard for
the mutual respect of others that
was demonstrated by the incident
at LSE should not be tolerated.
Firstly,because it is not something
a decent human being would do
and secondly,because it totally
disagrees with the principles of
Imperial College Union.”

Ebola update: UK airports and stations are
now screening passengers
This week, two UK airports and
Eurostar stations are to com-
mence screening passengers for
Ebola.
However, in a leaked government
e-mail circulated to doctors, it was
said that the extra security measures
would not be likely to provide any
sort of real public health benefits.
The UK government’s Chief Medi-
cal Officer, Dame Sally Davies, has
said that even though screening at
airports was only a “blunt instru-
ment,” it could still save lives.
Although screening usually doesn’t
pick up any cases, the measure is ben-
eficial in that it will educate people
as to what the symptoms of Ebola are
and what to notice if they feel sick.
The screening will commence
this week at Gatwick and Heathrow
airports as well as some Eurostar train
stations.
These airport screening are becom-
ing increasingly common, particu-
larly in the US, where screening is
already taking place at New York JFK
airport, with other US airports are
due to start checks this week.
A number of concerns have been
raised about the screening proce-
dures, notably if whether or not
someone wanting to enter the UK
would be honest if they had been
exposed to the virus.
The UK’s health secretary Jeremy
Hunt has said he is reassured that the
government has devised a robust set
of plans in case there were to be an
Ebola case in the UK.
It can be difficult to identify if
someone has the disease because the
symptoms; usually headache, vomit-
ing, fever and bleeding, closely resem-
ble colds, flu’s and even stomach bugs.
As well as having started screening
in the UK, the UK government has
provided aid to West Africa to help
contain the outbreak. This week, 750
military personnel and a medical ship
will be sent to Sierra Leone to help
give patients vital care, since many
hospitals in the afflicted countries
are filled to capacity. So far, the UK
has contributed 125 million pounds
in support of the West African
outbreak, which has now resulted in
4,024 deaths.
