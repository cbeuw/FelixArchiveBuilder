This month, the European
Medicines Agency has
announced its policy to make
open access all clinical trial data
given to it from 2015 onwards. The
Agency decides which medicines can
go on sale in countries in the EU,
and at first look, this policy seems
completely sensible.
Clinical trials need to be analysed
and available for researchers
and doctors, to let us know if the
medicines we use actually work. It
may come as a surprise then, that
around 50%of all the trial data for
medicines currently in use has not
been published. This figure comes
from a systematic review done by
the NHS NIHR Health Technology
Assessment Programme in 2010,
and also found that trials with
positive results are twice as likely to
be published as those with negative
results.
In this way, drug companies can
hide trials that demonstrate nasty
side-effects and that their medicines
may not always work effectively,
leading to disastrous results for
patients.
However, the EMA’s policy has
been criticised by Members of
the European parliament and
the AllTrials campaign, which is
dedicated to getting trial results
published, for not going far enough.
As it will apply only after 2015, it
will not make a difference for the
vast majority of the drugs currently
in use, most of which came onto the
market more than ten years ago.
The terms of use of EMA’s
policy that must be signed up to by
researchers also includes a statement
that allows trial sponsors to take
legal action against them if they
are suspected of misusing the data.
According to the AllTrials campaign
this introduces a significant risk of
researchers “being made vulnerable
to protracted legal battles with large
companies which will introduce a
new and unpredictable risk of high
legal costs into routine academic
work”.
Researchers at Imperial have
taken pictures to show
how a protein made by the
gene BRCA2, which has long been
implicated in the development of
many types of cancer (including breast,
ovarian and prostate), works to repair
damaged DNA.
Around 1 in 1000 people in the UK
can potentially harbour a mutated
form of the BRCA2 gene, with the
lifetime risk of breast cancer for
women with BRCA2 mutations being
40-85%, compared to 12%for women
in the general population who do not
have the mutated form of BRCA1 or
BRCA2.
BRCA2, a tumour suppressor gene,
was first identified by scientists
funded by Cancer Research UK in the
1990s. Since then, we have known how
the gene helps to prevent cells from
growing and dividing too rapidly in
an uncontrolled manner. BRCA2
does this by producing a protein
(the BRCA2 protein) that is directly
involved in the repair of damaged or
faulty DNA. The BRCA2 protein is
also known to interact with proteins
produced from several other genes,
most notably RAD51 and PALB2
genes, to mend breaks in DNA. Such
breaks in the DNA could be due to
natural causes (such as environmental
exposures) or artificial causes
(medical imaging or nuclear radiation
exposure); but, by helping repair of
the DNA the BRCA2 gene plays an
important role in maintaining fidelity
of a cell’s genetic information.
The research project led by
Professor Xiaodong Zhang, from the
Department of Medicine at Imperial,
and Dr Stephen West, from Cancer
Research UK London Research
Institute, has used electron microscopy
and protein purification to reveal the
structure of the BRCA2 protein and
show how it interacts with the RAD51
protein and DNA.
The study unveils that the 3,418
amino acid BRCA2 protein facilitates
the nucleation of RAD51 filaments
at multiple sites on single-stranded
DNA. Furthermore, 3D electron
microscopy reconstructions also
reveal how the BRCA2 protein exists
On top of this, the information in
the reports is not as transparent as it
appears—the EMA still reserve the
right to take out any information that
could be of “confidential commercial
importance” to pharmaceutical
companies, and not indicate where or
what information has been removed,
potentially leaving it open to the kind
of concealment seen in the lack of
publication of negative results.
Despite these shortcomings, the
policy is at least a significant step
forward by a major organisation to
shift focus onto more open-access
clinical data. This current version
has also come a long way since
it was initially proposed earlier
this year, with a ridiculous caveat
that researchers would not be able
to annotate, print off, save, copy
or share any of the information
contained in these, sometimes
thousands of pages long documents.
Although many pharmaceutical
companies are nervous about this
increased transparency, some are
actually for it — GlaxoSmithKline, for
instance have said “the more eyes on
our data the better for us”. Hopefully
the success of this policy will lead to
more transparency in the future.

as a dimer and two oppositely oriented
sets of RAD51 molecules bind to this
dimer; this complex then searches out
matching strands of DNA in order to
repair the break. This gives us a better
idea of how exactly the homologous-
recombination repair works and also
opens new pathways for possible
further research as well.
Professor Zhang, co-leader of the
study, explained how “this study
improves our understanding of a
fundamental cause of cancer [and]
gives us a platform to design new
experiments to probe its mechanism
in greater detail.” Hopefully, we
are not far off from translating this
knowledge into tangible benefits for
patients.
