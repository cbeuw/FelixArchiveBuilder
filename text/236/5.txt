FAIR R E N TS
Sir,
A t the first R . C . S . U n i o n m e e t i n g
this session a m o t i o n w a s passed,
that " a l l students" i n flats s h o u l d a p -
ply to the rent t r i b u n a l . It w a s said
that this w o u l d p r o d u c e a p o o l of
l o w fixed rents.
I believe that this w i l l not h a p -
p e n , because students f o r m too
small a p r o p o r t i o n of the flat-dwelling
p o p u l a t i o n of L o n d o n .
It w o u l d b e naive for a student
b o d y to t r y a n d force rents d o w n
w h e n it is i n such a m i n o r i t y . T h e
o n l y effect of such a m o v e w o u l d be
to create a " s t u d e n t b a r " m a k i n g it
impossible for students to find flats
at a l l . L a n d l o r d s a n d their estate-
agents w o u l d soon notice that flats
rented to students w e r e b e i n g c o n -
sidered by the R e n t T r i b u n a l . T h e
estate-agents w o u l d be u n w i l l i n g to
send client such tenants a n d w o u l d
veto a l l students.
If a student feels that his rent is
excessive h e c o u l d a p p l y i n d i v i d u a l -
l y to the tribunal. A register of rents
fixed i n the area is open for inspect-
ion at the local authorities offices, so
it is easy to check i f a n a p p l i c a t i o n
is w o r t h w h i l e . A tenant is given six
months security of tenure, after tlie
tribunal's decision, after w h i c h time
the tenant c a n a p p l y for a n extens-
ion. T h e t r i b u n a l c a n l i m i t the secur-
ity to as little as seven days a n d
e v e n if a longer p e r i o d is granted
the l a n d l o r d can a p p l y to have it
r e d u c e d i f the tenants' behaviour has
been unsatisfactory. F o r example, if
he has not c o m p l i e d w i t h the terms
of his contract.
It seems a p i t y that w h e n L o n d o n
colleges are expanded little or no
government m o n e y is directed t o -
wards student a c c o m m o d a t i o n .

W E w o n ?
Sir,
In v i e w of the statement apparent-
l y m a d e at the last G u i l d s U n i o n
M e e t i n g a n d also i n the almost n o n -
existent I C U n i o n H a n d b o o k to the
effect that G u i l d s w e r e the winners
of the ' t o w p a t h ' event at M o r p h y D a y
last year, I w o u l d b e pleased if y o u
c o u l d a l l o w m e to m a k e use of your
columns to state that i n fact R C S
w e r e i n possesion of the p u s h b a l l
for the w h o l e of the event except
the first ten minutes a n d thus there
is n o question b u t that they a n d not
G u i l d s w e r e the winners.

Carnival mess
Sir,
1 s h o u l d strongly like t o r e c o m -
m e n d to whoever was i n charge of
the C a r n i v a l squad on Saturday t h e
2 2 n d O c t o b e r that, if it is absolutely
necessary to use the tennis courts for
cleaning bill-boards o n , that i n
future he comes to some arrange-
ment w i t h the tennis c a p t a i n over
reserving the courts i n Princes
Gardens. A s I believe these boards
were b e i n g taken over to the
C h e m i s t r y D e p t . M i g h t I suggest
they b e cleaned o n the car park
w h i c h , is relatively free on Saturdays
and where the mess created w o u l d
be free to r u n into the p u b l i c drains.
I believe the C h e m i s t r y D e p t . has
r u n n i n g water so that the hose
w o u l d pose no p r o b l e m .

Y o u are p u b l i s h i n g a n advertise-

Senators w h o have p l e d g e d support
for the p o l i c y of w i t h d r a w a l of' U S

MIKE damaged
Sir,
O n the evening of W e d n e s d a y 26th
October certain m e m b e r s o f the U n i o n
saw fit to tamper w i t h the u n c o m -
pleted m i c r o m e t e r M I K E o n its p l i n t h
in the lower U n i o n lounge. I n spite
of a notice to the effect that it was u n -
finished they thought it w o u l d be
clever to d i s m a n t l e part of it a n d
leave most of the pieces as evidence
of their supreme intelligence. I p e r -
sonally h a d never thought that even
students o f f C w o u l d sink so l o w a s
to damage their o w n mascot.
It has made it apparent to m e that
M I K E needs protecting m o r e f r o m the
lower, d r u n k e n elements o f f C U t h a n
f r o m a n y external college, ft has also
made me doubt whether the effort put
into this project by so m a n y people
was really w o r t h w h i l e , o r rather
whether the students of I C are w o r t h y
of i t .

In defence
Sir,
N o t only r u b b i s h , but anonymous
rubbish! It c o u l d not possibly be
considered the responsibility of J i m
M u r r a y or B r i a n C o m p t o n to have
continued the arrangement of the
Freshers' h o p . O n f a i l i n g their exams
— w h i c h failure c a n b e largely at-
tributed to their w h o l e h e a r t e d efforts
for I C U n i o n a l l last y e a r — t h e y p r e -
sumably h a d jobs to take u p , w h i c h ,
even if i n L o n d o n , w o u l d p r e s u m -
ably o c c u p y their w h o l e w o r k i n g d a y .
F u r t h e r , C o l c u t t ' s i m p l i c a t i o n that
U n i o n officials w e r e not notified in
advance of their absence d u r i n g the
c o m i n g session appears to be er-
roneous as I saw J i m M u r r a y i n the
U n i o n buildings over a week before
he start of term.
T o use his (her?)own words, i t is
typical of the malaise that runs
through m u c h of C o l c u t t that a large
part of his c o m m e n t s h o u l d be devot-
e d to sleighting t w o of the U n i o n ' s
hardest workers w h o are not n o w
i n a position to reply.
R o d e r i c k J . R e d m a y n e
E d . ; M r . R e d m a y n e has requested
t h a t ' O n failing their exams' be
a m e n d e d to O n failing to return .
A CAREER IN

engineers and honours physicists who are interested in a career in operational
aspects of the Board's work.
The Board is carrying out a number of research programmes closely related to its
engineering interests. These include such topics as plasma physics, aerodynamics,
combustion studies, stress and vibration analysis, heat transfer, erosion and
corrosion studies, materials research and reactor physics.
Research careers are available . . .
