" O V E R C O N F I D E N C E IS T H E ally of defeat." T h i ; was cert-
ainly true at Harlington last Saturday when I.C. stumbled to the
brink of defeat, only just managing to scramble back from the abyss
and go through to the second round of the U . L . U . Cup Competition.
T h e difference between t h e t w o teams w a s o n l y apparent i n fitness,
footbuiiwise neither h a d a n y t h i n g t o o f f e r — w h e n t h e teams t r i e d t e n goals
w e r e scored i n f o r t y minutes, i n c l u d i n g fifteen minutes o f b l i n d mans
b u l l i n near darkness.
T h e game started oft i n a scrappy fashion, a n d c o n t i n u e d i n a similar
v e i n f o i t h e first hour; t h e only real -iit'orts, f o r I . C . , c o m i n g from T a y l o r ,
at half hack. N o r t h e r n P o l y t e c h n i c opened t h e scoring w h e n slack m a r k i n g
b y the l . C . defence a l l o w e d o n ' inside f o r w a r d to scramble t o b a l l home.
T h e exhausted state o f t h e opposition s l o w l y b e g a n to show i n t h e
second half, as I . C . g r a d u a l l y began to predominate. E v e n t u a l l y flashes of
ability from E a s t e l l p r o d u c e d three goals i n as m a n y minutes, p u t t i n g I . C .
in the lead. T h e t h i r d goal, from thirty yards, b u l g e d t h e back of t h e net
before t h e keeper h a d m o v e d .
It said m u c h f o r t h e courage of t h e N o r t h e r n P o l y team that i n t h e last
four minutes they c a m e back from near defeat a n d forced I . C . to extra
time. T h e college defence w a s again easily p i e r c e d a n d the m a t c h entered
a half hour extra time w i t h t h e score three a l l .
T h e gallant N o r t h e r n team c o u l d not s u m m o n u p t h e reserves o f energy
of spirit to beat their superiors i n fitness, a n d I . C . scored four m o r s gciils
i n extra time, c o m i n g f r e m H o p w o o d , E a s t e l l a n d Squire, to t h e opponent's
one.
I . C . w i l l i n d e e d b e relieved to get t h r o u g h this r o u n d after c o m i n g so
c'fwe to ignominious defeat. F i r m e r control is needed i n midfield, b v t h e
w i n g halves a n d inside f o r w a r d s — s o m e o n e w i t h the ability t o r e a d t h e
game w o u l H b e w e l c o m e .
T h e fighting spirit a n d t h e w i l l to w i n a t a l l cost is necessary i n every
game, w h e n I . C . l e a m a n d practise this thev w i l l b e n better t e a m
When the pressure's on, strange things can happen.
