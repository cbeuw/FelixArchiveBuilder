Folk Club
Irish
The McPeake family, a traditional
Irish folk group, brought a new and
enjoyable tvpe of music to I.C. when
they were the guests at the first Folk
Song Club meeting. Despite only
half of their normal complement of
six being able to appear, they gave a
varied, and, judging by the applause,
an extremely well received perform-
ance. The combination of an original
presentation of Folk Music seasoned
by traditional Irish wit, produced
splendid entertainment for the Club.
Martin Beer, a new member of the
Folk Club introduced the evening,
followed by an older resident. Steve
Grant, whose songs varied from the
unaccompanied traditional to those of
Derek Hall. Unabashed by their lack
of numbers, the McPeake family con-
tinued until the interval. An Irish
harp and Killien pipes—a form of
Irish bagpipes played with bellowsand
operated by the elbow—produced a
novel sound for two instrumental,
while cuitar and banio were used to
accompany traditional songs.
Locai College talent resumed the
evening after the interval. The While
City Ramblers moved through some
well known melodies, followed by
Ivor Grayson-Smith, in good form
after his illness. Sheila Henrywood
and Steve Grant.
The McPeake family returned to
complete the evening; their repertoire
extended by tin-whistle and bones (a
traditional form of spoons). Both
their traditional songs and instrumen-
tal produced loud applause, to the ex-
tent that the end of their performance
was protracted by overwhelming en-
cores.
An excellent start to the term was
undoubtably produced for the Folk
Club. For those unfortunate to miss
it, the next concert will feature the
Young Tradition.
Pooh: a
chump?
The Pooh Club, on its fourth Ex-
puotition, wont to the Ancient Roman
City of Verulainium in search of a
National Poohsticlcs Bridge, and was
declared to be "the Biggest Load of
Chumm I've ever seen" l)v a self-
appointed spokesman for the local
Residents Assoshiation.
Notwithstanding, it was a Good
Game, The match was won by the
ex-officio chairman, who dropped his
last stick at 5.30 p.m., by the light
of tlie Cat's well buttered Mini.
