T h e sudden d e a t h of the late
R e c t o r S i r Patrick L i n s t e a d leaves a
gap at the h e a d of I m p e r i a l C o l -
lege's administration. T h e gap has
filled b y Sir O w e n Saunders, P r o
Rector at I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e since 1964,
a n d n o w appointed A c t i n g Rector.
Sir O w e n Saunders, has a distinguish-
ed record b o t h i n the academic field
a n d i n a n administrative capacity, i n
various academic bodies, inside a n d
outside the C o l l e g e . B o r n i n 1904 he
was schooled at E m m a n u e l S c h o o l
a n d B i r k b e c k C o l l e g e , L o n d o n . H e
entered T r i n i t y C o l l e g e , C a m b r i d g e
as a n undergraduate a n d there be-
came a Senior Scholar. H i s l o n g as-
sociation w i t h I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e began
w h e n be was a p p o i n t e d to a L e c t u r e -
ship i n A p p l i e d M a t h e m a t i c a l Physics
i n 1932. A c a d e m i c a l l y his w o r k has
been centred on A p p l i e d T h e r m o -
dynamics a n d i n p a r t i c u l a r heat
transfer. M a d e Professor of M e c h a n -
i c a l E n g i n e e r i n g a n d H e a d of the
D e p a r t m e n t i n 1946. he b e c a m e
D e a n of C i t y a n d G u i l d s C o l l e g e i n
195S.
W h i l e the function of S i r O w e n
Saunders appointment is to bridge'
gap before a permanent appointment
is made, his task is not a l i g h t one,
a n d the C o l l e g e is g o i n g t h r o u g h a
stage of vast development a n d re-
organisation. H e sees this task as
m a i n t a i n i n g the m o m e n t u m of the
change a n d the policies i n t r o d u c e d
b y the late' Rector. It w o u l d b e dis-
astrous, a n d ill-fitting too, to the
m e m o r y of S i r Parick L i n s t e a d , to
a l l o w the p a c e of the College's p r e -
sent development to l a g . T h e A c t -
i n g Rector c o m p a r e d himself to a
caretaker G o v e r n m e n t , a n d w h i l e his
hands are not b o u n d , not a great deal
can be initiated i n the interim p e r i o d
before a n e w Rector is appointed.
H i s job is to see that the present de-
velopment is carried through w i t h
vigour. I n particular, the Sports
C e n t r e , the n e w C o l l e g e B l o c k -
both started i n October 1 9 6 4 — a n d
the n e w H a l l s o f Residence w i l l be
a d v a n c e d to completion.
Sir Owen's v i e w of I m p e r i a l C o l -
lege is that it has a ' t w i n role' to
fulfill. It is a n institute to produce
specialists, specialists that a techno-
logically based c o m m u n i t y requires,
a n d for this it must be a centre of
academic excellence, h o l d i n g a
special, if not unique, position i n
British training a n d research. I n a d -
dition, die C o l l e g e must' provide a
'University E d u c a t i o n ' — i n the broad
sense cf the t e r m — t o produce future
leaders of industry a n d business w h o
m a y move completely outside their
own specific discipline. It contains a
broad spectrum of discipline from the
Pure to the A p p l i e d — M a t h e m a t i c to
E n g i n e e r i n g — a n d to help to achieve
this latter role, greater contact
between the departments, between
the groups w i t h i n the departments
a n d a more fluid m o t i o n of ideas
b e t w e e n these groups m u s t be a i m -
e d at. T h e b r o a d e n i n g of I m p e r i a l
C o l l e g e can be achieved, too, by i n -
corDorating n e w schools w i t h i n the
College. I n this sense, the A c t i n g
Rector w i l l continue to work, as S i r
Patrick ^ i n s t e a d d i d , for an a m a l g a m -
ation w i t h t h e School o i t h e
A r c h i t e c t u r a l Association.
m r e p l y to the suggestion that
m a n y undergraduates treat i m p e r i a l
(-.ouege as a n educational i a c t o r y ,
rather than p a r t i c i p a t i n g more f u l l y
i n the lite or the C o l l e g e , Sir O w e n
thought that there were three ways
to remedy this; m u c h of w h i c h is
a l r e a d y p r o v i d e d . T h e H a l l s of R e -
sidence must be expanded, eventual-
l y to absorb m o r e students. R e s i d -
encial life w i l l then be the centre
of tne C o l l e g e outside academic af-
fairs. Those l i v i n g i n digs w i l l t h e n
naturally gravitate to the Residences
for a corporate cultural a n d social
life.
Secondly, I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e p r o v i d -
es a n d s h o u l d provide a w i d e range
of social a n d cultural facilities;
whether the student uses t h e m is
another matter. A l l that c a n b e d o n e
here is to see they exist a n d to help
t h e m flourish.
T h i r d l y a greater contact w i t h
other Colleges of L o n d o n University
c o u l d be achieved. L o n d o n U n i v e r s -
ity as a w h o l e provides a vast range
of activities.
A general c o m p l a i n t of British
Universities is that the undergraduate
courses are too specialised, a n d re-
strikted .directly to their o w n
discipline. T h i s , i n particular, is a
p r o b l e m at Imperial C o l l e g e where
a h i g h academic level must be
achieved w i t h i n a ,3 year under-
graduate course. Sir O w e n w o u l d like
to see the undergraduate courses
broadened so that students may defer
their decision to specialise in a giv-
en direction till the end of their first
y e a -
. S o m e departments are anxious
to see this change although others
fear a lowering of standards.
In general, the A c t i n g Rector de-
scribed himself as a liberal. H e w o u l d
like to m i n i m i z e compusion on stud-
ents b u t attract t h e m b y stimulation.
A b o v e all Imperial C o l l e g e is a c o l -
lege of a university, c o n t a i n i n g a
w-ide range of sciences w h i c h should
interlock w i t h a n d stimulate each
other. It contains postgraelnates and
undergraduates, m u t u a l l y depent : a
large ratio of postgraduates is neces-
sary to achieve a h i g h academic
standard, but w i t h o u t the u n d e r g r a d -
uate the C o l l e g e w o u l d degenerate
into a Research Institution.
Tony Duke was elected President
of I C U in June of this year. At the
time the reaction of many people
was ; " W h o ?" Even now his genial
features are none too well known,
though most evenings he can be found
in Southside b a r — " I'm trying to get
to know the people."
D u r i n g the speculation last year
concerning possible candidates it was
pointed out as a guide that tile P r e s i -
dent usually came f r o m the lower
ranks of C o u n c i l . T o n y c a m e i n
f r o m quite a different direction so let
us trace his rise to the Presidency.
H a v i n g g r o w n up i n a rough area
of P l y m o u t h he arrived at I C w i t h
a n impressive sporting record. A t
school he was C a p t a i n of S w i m m i n g
a n d he played R u g b y for the school
( P l y m o u t h College) a n d the country.
A t I C he went straight into the 1st
X V i n w h i c h he still plays. H i s
other social activities have included
beijig L e a d e r o f the C h u r c h Society
and o w n i n g (and bending) sports cars,
the present one being a n M G T F .
It is n o w f o u r years since T o n y
arrived at I C as a-» Fresher i n C i v
E n g . F o r the past three years (Uvo
undergraduate and one postgraduate)
he has been a Y e a r R e p o n G u i l d s '
C o u n c i l and w o u l d this year have
been GuildsV R e p on I C C o u n c i l .
A knowledge of C o u n c i l procedure he
considers to be " not essential " ; what
does matter is that he has a great
' understanding of the general layout—•
p r o b a b l y best obtained f r o m outside.
T o n y comes to the Presidency with
an open m i n d , p r o b a b l y as a result
of not w o r k i n g previously o n C o u n -
c i l w h i c h can have a restricting i n -
fluence. T h e accomplishments of the
U n i o n a n d its present state he finds
satisfactory but he feels that there is
a lack of p r i d e i n the U n i o n , a n i n -
sufficient l o y a l t y to it. T o h i m it
seems that there are far too few active
members ; a l l that is needed is for
everyone to support one or two clubs
or organisations really actively a n d
there w o u l d be a great improvement
i n the U n i o n ' s strength. P r o b a b l y this
support could come equally f r o m
undergrads and P . G S . — t h e latter
could help greatly by b r i n g i n g i n their
experience a n d responsibility while
the f o r m e r have great scope available
to them.
T h i s is a difficult year for the E x e c ,
the President sees danger to the
U n i o n ' s freedom f r o m " empire
builders " and fears that a new Rector
might be less permissive than was the
late S i r Patrick L i n s t e a d . It is a
year for the U n i o n to demonstrate
its s o l i d a r i t y a n d responsibility,
" t h o u g h I don't m i n d a little horse-
p l a y . " Whatever happens T o n y D u k e
feels that the U n i o n w i l l r u n happily.
