FAIR
RENTS
FOR
R C S
Last Thursday R.CJS. became
the twenty-first Student Union to
realise that the Rent Acts can
help students just as much as
other tenants.
Briefly, a l l rents o f u n f u r n i s h e d flats
are n o w frozen until a " F a i r R e n t "
has been fixed.
P r e m i u m s , K e y m o n e y a n d exces-
sive charges f o r fixtures a n d fittings
are n o w illegal.
A s a tenant, y o u c a n apply to y o u r
l o c a l F a i r Rents Officer f o r y o u r rent
to be reduced. I f y o u o r y o u r l a n d -
l o r d d o n o t like h i s judgement, y o u r
rent goes to the R e n t Assessment
C o m m i t t t e . T h i s hears b o t h sides a n d
then fixes the rent f o r three years, at a
f a i r level.
Scarcity is n o t considered as a fac-
tor. O n l y the a c c o m m o d a t i o n itself
is v a l u e d . S o i f y o u r rent i s a r t i -
ficially h i g h because you're i n a n " ex>-
pensive a r e a " i t w i l l p r o b a b l y be
greatly reduced.
F u r n i s h e d tenants c a n go to t h e
l o c a l F u r n i s h e d R e n t T r i b u n a l . Y o u
get s i x months security a u t o m a t i c a l l y
— e v e n i f y o u are under notice to quit.
T h i s is also the place to go i f y o u a r e
in digs.
Leeds U n i v e r s i t y U n i o n encourages
members to a p p l y f o r a rent reduc-
t i o n , a n d also provides free legal a d -
vice o n the merits o f each case. T h i s
scheme has bean w o r k i n g f o r over a
year. I asked V i c e - P r e s i d e n t J a c k
Straw some questions :
Q. W h a t has been the o v e r a l l

W h e n asked w h y he intended to
suggest this to R C S rather than
1C U n i o n , he explained that
there h a d n o t been the oppor-
tunity to present i t to C o u n c i l

That's always the difficulty with choosing a career; you can't
get much idea what it's really like from the outside—which
is why Unilever is giving you a chance to getan inside view.
Next vacation, from Jan 2-4, we're holding an Introduction
to Industry Course in London; it's designed to cover every
essential aspect of industry; talks, discussions, a visit to a
factory are all on the programme. Accommodation is in a
hotel, and all expenses will be met.
For obvious reasons, places are limited.So if you're interested,
^nd in your final year, get in touch with your Appointments
Officer as rapidly as possible. He'll give you an application
form and all relevant details. Or write direct to:—
C. R. Stewart, Esq., Personnel Division,
Unilever Limited, Unilever House, London, E.C.4
