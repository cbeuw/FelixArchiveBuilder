dred people gathered i n M e c h E n g re-
cently t o hear the first t a l k i n h i s
G e n e r a l Studies lecture o n " Aspects

In this talk G r e e n e x a m i n e d the
m u s i c o f the contemporary players,
L o u i s A r m s t r o n g a n d B i x Beider-
beche, a n d c o m p a r e d the differences
i n their music w i t h the differences i n
their environments. Whereas L o u i s
is the epitome o f the negro j a z z - m a n ,
h a v i n g dragged himself u p f r o m
poverty t o the pinnacle o f a c c l a i m as
a trumpet player, B i x w a s t h e
middle-class w h i t e m a n w h o " made
g o o d " ' i n t h e J a z z w o r l d a n d , as
B e n n y G r e e n demonstrated w i t h r e -
cords, this difference i n class a n d u p -
b r i n g i n g is reflected i n their music.
A s boys, b o t h were m u s i c a l l y a d -
vanced a l t h o u g h i n different direc-
tions. L o u i s was b o r n w i t h jazz i n
his soul, w h i l e Bix's m u s i c was i n -
itially guided a l o n g most " respect-
able " lines. T h e social pressure o f
the day prevented Beiderbeche f r o m
p l a y i n g i n p u b l i c w i t h t h e better
musicians o f the period, w h o were
m a i n l y negro, so his records are, as
B e n n y lOreen said, " indifferent {re-
cordings w i t h o n e r e d e e m i n g feature
— B i x Beiderbeche." O n e t h e other
hand, A r m s t r o n g was able t o record
w i t h top-class jazz-men, a n u n c o m -
m o n e x a m p l e o f s o c i a l inequality.
B u t , after hours, t h e t w o frequently
played together a n d such w a s their
m u t u a l respect that B i x called L o u i s
" the greatest trumpeter that ever
l i v e d , " w h i l e L o u i s called B i x " the
greajest trumpeter that ever l i v e d . "
H o w e v e r , w h i l e A r m s t r o n g ' s forte
was i m p r o v i s a t i o n , Beiderbeche h a d
a strong sense o f h a r m o n i c values a n d
towards the end o f his short l i f e was
experimenting and t r y i n g to bridge the
gap between jazz a n d classical m u s i c ,
w i t h little success. A r m s t r o n g h a s
n o w expanded his h o r i z o n s a n d b e -
c o m e perhaps more o f a n entertainer
than a jazz m u s i c i a n .
So, B i x Beiderbeche died early o f
h a r m o n i c insecurity; L o u i s A r m s t r o n g
entertains o n , a n d B e n n y G r e e n
w i l l undoubtedly return t o p l a y out his

H e regretted that so m a n y students

were interested only i n what affected

H e was p a r t i c u l a r l y critical o f the
political societies at I . C . T h e y were
always talking, he said, b u t never
really d o i n g anything. ( H e gave this
as h i s reason f o r leaving S o c S o c
some years ago.)
It also transpired i n the course o f
his talk that he is i n favour o f I . C .
