L o r d Beeching's S p e e c h t o u c h e d
on one of the vital issues one m i g h t
have expected f r o m such a dis-
t i n g u i s h e d industrialist. Its content
was m u c h more relevant to I C a n d
quite uncontroversial L o r d B e e c h i n g ,
w h o is a D i p l o m a t e of I C , devoted
the first quarter of his Address to a n
explanation of h o w h e h a d c h a n g e d
since l e a v i n g the C o l l e g e . H e just-
ified this as a w a r n i n g , that, as an
observer a n d commentator " I a m
biased b y m y o w n p a r t i c u l a r exper-
iences".
M o v i n g on to his m a i n subject h e
postulated the average graduate
starting out ' p u r s u i n g a career...
w i t h i n the confines of (his) o w n
speciality'. T h e n later i n life find-
i n g himself 'increasingly interested
in adjacent fields of k n o w l e d g e , u n -
til eventually he is 'likely to take
interest i n the overall effectiveness

ation of the distribution of science

arts graduates i n 'the jobs... filled by
w e l l - e d u c a t e d men'. T h e d i a g r a m
was difficult to follow but b y care-
:
f u l consideration it can be seen to

a rectangular display i n w h i c h
"scientists" are represented b y black
spots a n d "artists" by crosses, w h i l e
those job filled by none graduates are
m a r k e d w i t h circles, «| M o v i n g across

es, c l i m b i n g u p the d i a g r a m the

c l u d e d that black spots w o u l d c o n -
gregate i n the lower left corner a n d
spread u p w a r d s more or less vertic-
ally; the crosses w o u l d be spread

ses, b u t v e r y f e w b l a c k spots'.
O u r fault
H e expressed regret at the situation
but pointed out that it is partly the
"scientists" fault a n d arises from a
viscous circle w h i c h w e can do m u c h
to break. T h e r e is a n o p i n i o n , he
said, that "scientists" a r e less vers-
atile t h a n "artists" a n d the conclusion
was d r a w n that this is due to i n a b i l -
ity. I n fact it is a result of the ex-
cessive d e m a n d / s u p p l y ratio a n d the
relative qualities of arts a n d science
teachers. T h e graduate of "science"
is less rounded than a n " a r t s " m a n .
It is o u r job, he c o n c l u d e d , to
think of ourselves 'as h i g h l y intel-
liget, w h i c h y o u are; as w e l l - e d u c a t -
e d people, w h i c h y o u should be; a n d
never hesitate to broaden your ex-
perience'.

Memorial Service-
glowing tribute
L o r d F l o r e y paid s l o w i n g tribute to Sir Patrick I .instead i n his address
at the M e m o r i a l Service f o r the late R e c t o r . T h e C o l l e g e h a d lost this d e d i -
cated and sympathetic person at the height of his powers. In a period when
most had a dread of being incompetent he stood out and determined that
we should not f a i l .
F o l l o w i n g his appointment as
Rector in 1955, he became i n v o l v e d
in discussions at G o v e r n m e n t level on
education and research. F r o m then
on he devoted the finest years of his
life to the College and it is due to
his great administrative ability that
the C o l l e g e owes it present position.
Its students w i l l have cause to be
grateful to h i m a l l their lives.
T o achieve a sufficient, control over
the College, another m a n might have
been ruthlessly efficient, but under Sir
Patrick one sensed a happy atmos-
phere about the C o l l e g e . It was
always his aim that although the
principal task was to produce scien-
tists, the products s h o u l d be
" rounded " scientists.
L o r d F l o r e y pointed out that S i r
Patrick was a vcrv h u m a n person and
enjoyed his homedife. W i t h o u t the
great help given by L a d y Linstead the
success w o u l d not have been achieved.
A t the R o y a l Society S i r Patrick
and L o r d F l o r e y w o r k e d together ; o n
L o r d Flottjy's election to President he
was t o i J lie was luck) to have Sir
Patrick there to keep h i m straight. In
judgement and action he was superb
and made a delightful colleague.
L o r d F l o r e y ended with the reminder
that S i r P a t r i c k Linstead was a
scientist of great distinction and a
splendid f r i e n d .
L o r d F l o r y . who is Provost of
Queens College, O x f o r d , was a great
friend of the late Rector and the
emotion he felt at the loss was readily
discernible in his speech.
A m o n g the many distinguished visi-
tors present with L a d y Linstead were
members of the G o v e r n i n g B o a r d ;
L o r d i Sherfield. Sir Charles
C u n n i n g h a m , D r . D . H . Follet. L o r d
Stamp : also present were T h e M a y o r
of K e n s i n g t o n and Chelsea, the L o r d
M a y o r of Westminster, Sir E d m o n d
and L a d y Playfair, S i r Solly and L a d y
Z u c k e r m a n ; and i n . i c . J a veritable
host of dignitaries. T h e y were seated
in the nave w i t h the senior members
of the" U n i o n .
T h e service was simple and lasted
o n l y half an hour. T h e lesson wnas
read by President T o n y D u k e and this
progressed after prayers led by the
Rev. C l e v e r l y F o r d , to L o r d Florey's
address. T h e blessing v,js given by
the Bishop of L o n d o n and the l . C .
c h o i r then sang.
