on manpower
B y 1908 it is predicted that for the
first time i n recent history, the
n u m b e r of scientists required i n
Britain w i l l be greater than the
n u m b e r of engineers. T h i s is one of
the conclusions of the Jackson C o m -
mittee report o n M a n p o w e r Resourc-
es w h i c h was published recently.
T h e committee w a s reporting a
comprehensive survey of the deploy-
ment of technically qualified people.
T h e committee, w h i c h w a s headed
by Professor Sir W i l l i s Jackson, H e a d
of E i e c . E n g . , also p r o d u c e d the first
study of tire e m p l o y m e n t of technical
supporting staff.
T h e figures for 1968 are based on
the results of enquiries made to i n -
dustry on their requirements a n d are,
as »uch, only estimates. T h e output
of scientists from universities for that
year w o u l d have to be 14,000 w h i l e
12,000 engineering graduates are r e -
quired. T h i s is 2 4 % i n excess of the
foreseeable numbers a n d c o u l d only
be met b y redeployment from other
sectors.
Another revealing fact produced
in the report is that although d u r i n g
the period 1963-66, there has been an
increase of 3 5 % i n the numbers of
engineers employed i n teaching at
university level, at school level,
where students are choosing their
careers, there has been only a 5%
increase i n the n u m b e r of engineers
employed.
O n the same day, the Swann C o m -
mitee Report on M a n p o w e r P a r a -
meters showed that from the 4,000
engineers a n d 9.000 seientists w h o
graduated in 1965. 19.6"', of the
engineers a n d 3 4 . 2 % of the scientists
went on to IlighiT studies a n d re-
search. 5 . 1 % of the scientists left the
country, as d i d 5.9% of t h e engineers.
T i i e committee, of w h i c h Profes-
sor M . M . S w a n n , Principal of
E d i n b u r g h University, was c h a i r m a n ,
criticised the present system in w h i c h
the "student tends to enter univers-
ity already c o n v i n c e d that research
is the goal w o r t h setting his heart
o n " . It was this v i e w w h i c ' i Profes-
sor L a i t h w a i t e attacked at a recent
meeting of the E n g . Soc. In his
o p i n i o n graduates needed for r e -
search w e r e b e i n g lost to industry
w h e r e their talents were wasted.

A t the Social C l u b s C o m m i t t e e
meeting o n October 25th, it was de-
cided to w i n d up S C R U T I N Y , the
Committee's magazine. T h e reason
given f o r this was that it was i m -
possible to obtain sufficient advertis-
ing : it was suggested that the literary
geniuses o f S . C . C . should apply their
talents to P H O E N I X , w h i c h at the
moment has no editor to accept or
reject their efforts. A p p a r e n t l y
P H O E N I X has plenty of advertising
but " c o u l d use more cn]>\ ' i n view
of these facts, the motion to w i n d up
S C R U T I N Y w a s passed by a con-
siderable majority.

of either a concert o f classical m u s i c

COSMOLOGY
L o o k i n g at the stars without a
t e l e s c o p e ! Professor B o n d i i n h i s
lecture t o W e l l s Soc. presented a n d
explained some of the basic thones
Oi tlio Universe.
S p e a k i n g t o a very large audience,
he s h o w e d h o w from a f e w classic-
a l physics' concepts t h e m o d e r n
m o d e l of t h e U n i v e r s e is b u i l t u p :
h o w the elements w e r e f o r m e d a n d
w h y their natural distribution is as
it is. T h e concept of time as seen
by classical physics (time is revers-
ible) a n d as seen b y thermodynamics
(time not reversible) a n d h o w these
concepts fit into t h e picture of the
U n i v e r s e as w e see i t ; t h e reason
w h y a gyroscope keeps a set position
w i t h respect t o t h e distant stars a n d
h o w it is postulated that the distant
stars a r e m o v i n g away from us at a
speed proportional to their distance.
T H E P O O R A T T E N D A N C E at this
year's Safety Lecture w a s extremely
disappointing, only about fifty of a l l
the undergraduates, postgraduates,
technicians a n d staff o f the college
bothering to attend. E v e n despite
the poor publicity, considering
the the fact that the workshops a n d
laboratories of the college contain n o
fewer dangers than a modern factory,
a greater attendance w o u l d have been
expected.
T h e lecture, entitled " Seeing the

WEEKEND
PROJECT
A n O.S.S- w o r k i n g party recently
completely redecorated one r o o m o f
an elderly couple's flat. T h i s was the
first weekend project carried out by
O.S.S., the n e w l y - f o r m e d college so-
ciety w h i c h arranged f o r bands o f
volunteers to undertake projects i n
the K e n s i n g t o n a n d N o t t i n g H i l l
areas.
T h e project arose i n a fairly t y p i c a l
way. T h e need f o r redecoration,
w i t h its attendant boost to morale, w a s
first noticed b y a n organisation f o r
social w o r k , a n d they passed the re-
quest o n to O.S.S. T h e M i n i s t r y o f

sary equipment a n d materials a n d
everyone concerned gave their services
free.
S i m i l a r projects w i l l continue

ing t d offer h i s or her services w i l l be
welcome. A s projects are arranged,

In reply to a question o n the idea
of a n expanding Universe, he said
this w a s really a misnomer. It is
true that the distant stars a r e reced-
i n g at tremendous speeds b u t not
into a v o i d . T h i s w o u l d contradict
one of the basic ideas of the U n i v e r s e
w h i c h states that it is completely
u n i f o r m . T h i s shows h o w difficult it
is to picture the m o d e m idea of the
Universe.
H o w e v e r , Professor B o n d i w a s
extremely clear i n his presentation o f
the complex ideas liehind m o d e m
cosmology w h i c h l e d to a stimulating
discussion after his lecture.
heat or cold a n d even prolonged c o n -
stancy o f temperature are likely to
cause concentration to flag a n d i n -
crease the l i k e l i h o o d o f accidents.
H o w e v e r , in many cases, machinery
can be built to concentrate the atten-
tion o f the operator on important i n -
struments o r on dangerous parts o f
the machinery to help stop the m i n d
wandering from them.
M u c h work remains to be done on
the subject, w h i c h is increasingly
more important as more complex
machinery is introduced into industry,
but at a n y rate, as D r . B u z z a r d i n -
formed us I.C. has a safety record to
be p r o u d o f (despite the attendance
at his lecture).
