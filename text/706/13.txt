IC Sunday XI vs Silwood Park XI
Alec Bedser joined in the
controversy last weekend over
the future career of IC Sunday XI •
skipper, Graham. Along with
Peter May, chairman of the
England selectors, Mr Bedser
made a flying visit to Harlington.
At a press conference, the
following statement was issued:
'In the forthcoming Ashes Test
series, with an Australian side
missing some of its South African
'rebels', the authorities at Lords
have offered the Australians the
option of playing between twelve
and fifteen men per match. It is
hoped that this will be taken as a
gesture of goodwill; the only
condition is that one of the team
must be Graha.m, the IC Sunday
captain, and that he must field
throughout and be allowed to
bowl at least two overs'.
A spokesman for the
Australian supporters was
reported to have replied that
such a low down underhand trick
is beneath contempt.
'It's true that we make rules
about balls per over and who can
and can't play; but although
playing with more then eleven
men has historical precedent,
none of them could have played
like Graham', said Mr Sydney
Oprahouse, Chairman of the
Koala Lumpur Tea company and
President of the military wing of
the Australia Cricket supporters
club.
Meanwhile, the Australian
tour manager made a similar
gesture to Mr Bedser. 'Let them
play with twenty men, as long as
one of them is Graham', he said,
'and make Graham bowl just one
over!'.
This followed Saturday's
match when Silwood encount-
ered the Sunday XI. Losing the
toss yet again, The Sunday XI
found themselves in the field. In
this 40 overs a side match,
Silwood began slowly against
Leyland and Khan who reduced
the batting side to 30 for one in
sixteen overs the ball swinging
up to two feet through the air-
and that was without the
vaseline. When Graham took
over the bowling he brought
about utter confusion, producing
a run out in his first over.
However, the score began to
accumulate, until five wickets fell
in seven overs, leaving Silwood
all out on 160 in the 39th over.
Richard took four for 28, and
Jeynes three for 20. Le Mesurier,
the Silwood skipper and opening
batsman gave stability to the
innings. However dropped
catches, and extras, and
batsman 'not being good enough
to find the ,edge' — eh,
Dave?—had ensured that IC
were set a target that they had
only achieved once before. All
the Silwood batsmen had scored
a few runs, except the
experienced Pramulch—who
knew what was to follow.
The IC innings opened with
Gaskill being bowled first over by
the reliable Hamilton. The
innings was then given a
sparkling foundation by Ayres
and Richard who took the score
to 70 in ten overs, before
Pramulch brought about a
terrifying collapse, to 93 for five.
This included the wicket of
Chew, spectacularly caught low
down at cover point by a fielder
on the run; and Smith, out first
ball, swinging across the
line—obviously taking lessons
from his captain. Khan
proceeded to steady the innings,
with help from first Leyland and
then Bradley. A scoring rate of
three an over was maintained,
but wickets continued to fall. A
few imaginative wides helped the
score, but the bowling was
always tight—as were the
captain's trousers. Obviously
too much food at tea time. As
Khan tried to hit out, he sliced a
catch to deep backward square
leg. But it was put down just
three yards inside the boundary
as was the fielder. With nine now
needed in five overs, Bradley
departed, bringing in Jeynes.
Giving a sharp catch and bowled
chance, and several others in the
first four balls faced, he smashed
a four off the last ball of the 36th
over, and Khan did the rest,
hitting eight off the 37th, bringing
up his own 50 (eight fours) and an
IC victory by three wickets.
Pramulch, with four for 19 in
eight overs was the pick of the
bowlers, while Ballard proved
slightly worse than Graham (but
his batting made up for that—he
scored eight)
Neil Murphy didn't bat or bowl
but was a jolly good sport. Next
week, Neil, next week...The
Match ended after eight-o-clock;
the drinking after nine-o-clock.
Next week we play IC
Union—on Sunday, and in three
weeks we meet IC Ladies.
And Finally, do you know the
one about tea made from Koala
bears?...
Silwood: 160 (Le Mesurier 38,
Ellison 20, Long 19, Ameer 15,
Leyland 1-14, Jeynes 3-20,
Richard 4-28)
IC: 164-7 (Khan 51, Richard 47,
Ayres 25, Ameer 1-20, Pramulch
4-19)
ATHLETICS
Short

Season
The men were overshadowed
two weeks ago by a compact
Imperial Ladies Squad who
annihilated the opposition at the
Southern Universities Athletics
Championship, Reading.
Ladies Results

Overall
1. Imperial
The Ladies Squad of four(!)
comprising, Imoni Akpofure,
Charlotte Ford, Jo Savage,
Sarah Shaw well deserved their
win. Imoni barely missed winning
in the 100m with a fine second
(13.7s). In the 800m, Sarah Shaw
won comfortably (we promise we
won't tell them about the
opposition!) and Charlotte by no
means disgraced herself with
some fine Javelin throwing.
Good High Jumping from the
Reading girl meant that Jo had to
settle for second place with a
season's best of 1.60m.
The team effort on the part of
the ladies was epitomised by
their 4x100m relay perform-
ance—a quality win.
Alas, the 4x100m is not the
best point to start on as far as the
men are concerned where poor
practice showed.
However, all was far from
gloomy; especially for Graham
Harker, Peter Howes and Roger
Loughney who all competed very
well indeed. Peter, though
injured, won both Shot and
Discus to bring IC good points.
Roger—'Hey Mum I've won a
sprint'—Loughney proved too
strong for the best in a close
100m and just missed the Sprint
double coming second in the
200m.
Graham Harker produced two
good performances in the 800m
heats (2:05.5s) where he
comfortably qualified and the
final (1:58.3) where he finished
second in a strong field. Good
points were provided by Andy
Gain who competed well in the
100m, to get to the final, the
110m Hurdles and the 200m.
The men finished the day on a
high note coming a good second
in the 4x400m (John, Jon, Lea,
Roger and Graham).
This marks the end of our
short (but sweet) season, at least
as far as the Imperial team is
concerned. Next year we hope
to fulfil many more fixtures and
have good training sessions,
details of which will be produced
at the end of this term. If you are
interested and have not been in
touch before please contact
John Pope, Cross-country via
Union letter racks. Have a good
summer!
