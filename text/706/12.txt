BOAT
From Heads
to Regatta
The Boat Club this year has been
divided into several different
squads and within these squads
there has been strong
competition for places in the top
crew from each squad.
National Squad
The club has two members in the
Nautilua VIII, the men's National
Lightweight (LWT) Squad crew.
Both members, J Griffiths and W
Downing have as a result spent
considerable amounts of time
training at the squad head-
quarters at Hammersmith. The
Nautilua VIII came fourth in the
Tideway Head and won Open
Eights at Nottingham City
Regatta. The crew will be going
to Nottingham International,
Henley, Lucerne, National
Championships and the World
Championship in the following
two months. Despite their
considerable achievements in
representing the club in a
National crew they found time to
race for the club in the Scullers
Head. W Downing won three
pennants and came fifteenth, the
pennants included the third
LWT pennant, the Senior B
pennant and the LWT Senior B
pennant. John also won a
pennant as the highest placed
Novice Sculler finishing twenty-
fourth. The entry of 404 scullers
gives an indication of the quality
of their performance.
The Men's Top Squad
This squad got off to a sticky
start with coaching from
numerous sources. The training
programme in the first three
months of the year nevertheless
thinned it out to the more
dedicated oarsmen. John
McArthur took over coaching
the squad full-time in January
and proceeded to give the squad
the direction it badly needed.
The squad had little time to
prepare fully for the Heads and
trained with a view to the
Tideway Head as its aim.
Regrettably the performance in
this event was handicapped by
illness, and the attentions of the
squad were then focussed on
Bedford Head. The squad picked
up wins in Senior A and Senior B
coxless pairs and Senior A
coxless fours.
Following Bedford Head a
coxless four was selected from
the squad, and two members
joined what had been the Novice
VIII and the other two formed
part of a Senior A coxless four.
The coxless four trained hard
with its eyes set on Ghent,
Nottingham and Henley and
possibly National Championship.
All members of the four had to go
on a diet to trim down to the
lightweight limit. The crew
managed to make the weight for
Ghent helped by some fairly
close to starvation diets. Ghent
proved to be a great success as
the Last 4 gained invaluable
experience of racing at an
international level over 2000m,
and it had the added benefit of
picking up a silver medal in the
Under 23, LWT 4. On the
Saturday of the seventh Belgian
Championship to pick up more
race experience the crew raced
in the Open Coxless IV's, a non-
lightweight event and qualified
for the final of the event at the
expense of University of London
and others. In the final of five
crews, which was viewed as
giving the crew another race
over the distance, Imperial
finished fifth as expected, with
the French Composite finishing
fourth. The crew won their silver
on the Sunday finishing three
seconds adrift of a German LWT
Composite. The now changed
crew is now training hard with
Henley and a LWT 4 at National
Championships in the forefront
of its aims.
The Men's Novice Squad
At the start of the year Bill Mason
started with a strong squad of
Novice oarsmen. With intensive
training that few if any other
Novice squads endure, the
group was divided into a Novice
squad and a Novice-Novice
squad. I hasten to add that both
names of reference couldn't be
more inappropriate. The Novice
VIII went through the entire
Head season without losing.
There were wins at Burway,
Kingston, Reading and at the
Tideway Head which is the first
time Imperial has achieved such
a string of wins. The emphatic
nature of the wins and the wins
that were achieved in fours as
well, looked good for the regatta
season. At Bedford Head the
Novice Squad had wins in all
fours events they entered. The
combined wins of the Top two
Novice squads gave a club
record of nine wins in one day at
a Head.
The Novice VIII won its first
regatta at Hammersmith and
then had to race at Senior C
status and above; and since then
has won Senior C VIH's at
Mortlake Spring and Senior B
VIII's at Thames Ditton. The VIII
strenghtened by two members of
the top squad will hopefully
continue in its winning way and
pick up the racing experience
that it so vitally needs to achieve
the ambitions it has set itself in
the Thames Cup at Henley.
Not forgetting the so-called
Novice-Novice squadâ€”they
have trained hard all winter and
with self-motivation and little on
the water coaching came close to
wining at Mortlake Spring getting
through three rounds and losing
in the final. At Putney Town they
won Novice IV's and are now
looking to racing at Senior C.
The Women's Squad
The Women's squad of eight did
well through the winter achieving
a very creditable performance in
the Women's Eight's Head
beating many of their rivals such
as the University of London.
Since the Head Season the
Women's squad had gone from
strength to strength and the VIII
has been unlucky not to win.
Increased training under the
supervison of J Griffiths has seen
vast improvements in both
technique and fitness. At Aipha
Borrie the women's squad won
Senior B coxless pairs and
showed how well their VIII was
going but were unlucky to come
up against a strong and
experienced Thames VIII. At
Nottingham City the women's
Senior B four which consisted of
two novice oarswomen won an
the Saturday rowing through
Durham and Southampton
University in a spirited
performance. This is probably
the best result for an Imperial
College Women's crew for
several years as they were the
fastest women's college or
university crew at the event.
Hopefully the successes of the
year will be sustained by the
various squads and added to by a
recently formed double scull and
Senior A coxless four.
