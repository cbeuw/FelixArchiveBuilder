Student dies after meal
An Engineering student collapsed
and died last Tuesday as a result of
consuming a Sherfield Refectory
meal. His name is being withheld
until the College authorities have
contacted his relatives.
Friends of the student told
F E E L S I C K that they had eaten
with him on Monday lunchtime
in the Lower Sherfield Dining
Room. The deceased had eaten
baked mince beef roll, peas, and
chips whilst his friends had eaten
pizza, peas and chips.
On his way to afternoon
lectures, the student collapsed in
the Mchanical Engineering
Department foyer, clutching his
stomach. While the messenger
contacted the College Health
Centre, the student's friends
placed pullovers under his head
to make him comfortable.
The doctor from the Health
Centre immediately telephoned
for an ambulance and the student
was taken to St Stephen's
Hospital. While in intensive care
he e x p e r i e n c e d v i o l e n t
convulsions and passed away in
the early hours of Tuesday
morning.
At the postmortem held on
Wednesday afternoon, it was
revealed that death had been
caused by an excessive amount of
foreign indigestible material
building up to the student's
stomach. Professor Brown, the
pathologist who performed the
autopsy told F E E L S I C K that he
found 957 potato peelers, 251 can
openers, 152 fly buttons, 92
hairpins, 61 cigarette butts, 57
toenails, 29 pairs of spectacles, 25
sets of false teeth, 18 glass eyes,
15 Max Bygraves cassettes, 14
colostomy bags, 12 packets of
suppositories, 5 digital watches, 2
rusty bicycle pedals and one
surgical support in the deceased
student's stomach and colon. He
added that he would be
contacting the Guinness Book of
Records just as soon as he had
washed his hands.
Reaction to the death has been
swift at the College. A n
undisclosed source in the
S h e r f i e l d K i t c h e n s t o l d
F E E L S I C K that as soon as M r
Mooney heard about the death
he rushed into the refectory and
told the chef not to keep the
gravy browning on the same shelf
as the potato peelers, can
openers, fly buttons, hairpins,
cigarette butts, t o e n a i l s ,
spectacles, false teeth, glass eyes,
M a x B y g r a v e s c a s s e t t e s ,
colostomy bags, suppositories,
digital watches, rusty bicycle
pedals and surgical supports.
F E E L S I C K asked M r Mooney
about the student's death. M r
Mooney said that it was probably
something he ate. When
F E E L S I C K challenged this
statement, M r Mooney said that
he was very sorry about the death
as it gave College catering a bad
reputation and that it really
'screwed up' his chances of a
C B E in the Birthday Honours
List. He stressed that he had
taken steps to ensure that it
wouldn't happen again. He
added that there had been a
similar incident earlier in the
week but the student had not
died. He said that he would
apologise to the next of kin but as
the student had made such a 'life
and death' issue about it he
would not give them a refund.
F E E L S I C K asked Captain
Lindley, Domestic Secretary,
how many students had died
after eating at IC. He answered
53,744, but doubted if they had
died immediately after eating.
J o h n P a s s m o r e , I C U
President, said that the affair was
very distressing, particularly as it
had happened now as it would
i n t e r f e r e w i t h his U L U
Presidential election campaign.
'Nevertheless' he stressed, 'I will
help theâ€”College hush up this
matter to the best of my abilties'.

Health centre
after meal
An IC student, Abid Ali Dost, a
Chemistry PG, received a cut lip
on Tuesday evening while eating a
meal in the Southside Refectory.
He had been eating Pizza, rice
and salad in the main Southside
Dining Room, when he cut the
inside of his lip on a piece of glass
approximately one centimetre
long. The glass came from his
meal, so he went back to the
serving point with two friends.
When he complained, he was told
that the bowl containing the
salad was chipped, and it was
thought that the glass came from
there. M r Dost was taken to the
Health Centre at 6.00pm for
medical attention.
M r Dost told F E L I X that he
thought it strange that the
Southside staff should know of
such a hazardous bowl, as they
could identify it immediately, but
still serve from it. He added that
the way the matter had been dealt
with in Southside made it appear
that such events were an
everyday occurance.
On returning to Southside
later, the offending bowl was still
being used to serve salads from
and it was not removed until a
further complaint was made.
When F E L I X telephoned M r
Mooney, he said that he knew
nothing about the affair, as it had
not been reported to him. When
he was asked about the chipped
salad bowl, he relied that it was
only hearsay, and he would not
comment on it.
Junk food
LAST TUESDAY afternoon a
computing first year under-
graduate found a piece of metal in
his Sherfied Refectory meal.
He had been eating quiche,
chips and sweetcorn, when he
discovered a chunk of metal in
his mouth. His friend, who was
also eating the same food, found
a piece of metal in his meal as
well.
The person concerned took the
pieces to M r Mooney, Catering
Manager, who asked what the
students had been having to eat.
On hearing sweetcorn mentioned
he went to the can-opener in the
kitchens to inspect it. He said
that the blade was old and had to
be replaced.
