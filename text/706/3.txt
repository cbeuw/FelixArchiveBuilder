UNION FINANCE Committee
decided yesterday not to buy the
boat club a new eight next year.
The boat club had claimed the
new boat was needed to allow
them to continue to compete at
top level.
The decisions made at. UFC
means that the Union only needs
to save a further £4,000 to stay
within budget. A sum which
sabbatical officers believe can be
achieved without too much
difficulty.
Rowing eights normally lose
speed at the rate of about two
lengths a year. As a result most
top clubs purchase a new boat
every year. Imperial College boat
club compete successfully in
many of Europe's top events
including the Henley and Ghent
regattas. It is almost two years
since Imperial College last
bought a new eight.
The meeting also decided to
raise the membership fees for
most clubs and to allow funding
for certain tours to internation-
ally recognised events.
