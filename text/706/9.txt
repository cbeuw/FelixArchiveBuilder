It is said that immunity to
poisons can be obtained by
taking small, frequent doses of
them. It seems that even this
comforting thought does not
induce the I C student to
patronise the Mooney emporia.

Vol-au-vent
Extremely disturbing reports
have reached F E L I X recently
concerning the degree of
infestation of the Southside
kitchen with cockroaches.
The insects have over-run the
kitchens to such an extent that
they are now finding their way
into the food.
Last week, at least three vol-
au-vent calypsos turned out to
contain cockroaches. A n d how
many people ate their cockroach
without realising it?
Cockroaches can be seen on
the walls and floor of the kitchens
at all hours of the day and they
swarm all over the place at night.
Some of the more daring actually
watch the television.

Can Mooney be suprised that
staff are hard to come by? Would
you work in a bug infested
kitchen? Moreover, the stink of
rotting food, well known to all
Falmouth and Tizard residents,
would attract all the insect life in
SW7!!!
F E L I X C A L L S F O R
A C T I O N NOW!!! In the next
issue of F E L I X we hope to
publish a further investigation,
together with M r Mooney's
replies.
The matter will also be
discussed at today's Union
Meeting.

F E L I X asked M r Mooney for his
opinions on a possible refectory
boycott. He gave the impression
of being upset and offended.
In his opinion the standard of
hygiene in Southside was
acceptable and not worse than
the other refectories.
Mr Mooney said that the
kitchen staff in Southside were
more annoyed than he himself
was. The staff were particularly
offended that the students found
their food inedible.
Moving on to the alleged
c o c k r o a c h i n i e s t a t i o n in
Southside, M r Mooney stated
that it was no worse than most
o u t s i d e r e s t a u r a n t s a n d
considerably better than some.
He cited the Savoy where
cockroaches are often seen
crawling across the dining room
floor!
He said that cockroaches were
b a s i c a l l y c l e a n , harmless
animals, despite their ugly
appearance, and were a negligble
health hazard. Of much more
concern w ere the flies. College
Block in particular suffered from
a large number of flies, a
nuisance which started during
the recent dustmen's strike. Also
the Union kitchens were troubled
by many black beetles coming
out of heating ducts.

Give Southside a chance
'The standard of cooking has
improved in the last fortnight,
and must be given a chance.' So
said M r Stephenson at 'Massive
(Inquorate) Mooney Meeting'
last week.
Mr Stephenson (Refectory
Committee Chairman) and M r
Mooney answered questions
from the floor. M r Mooney saw
no necessity for such extreme
measures as a boycott, but agreed
that the standard of cuisine in
S o u t h s i d e used to leave
something to be desired. The
cooks were quite upset by the
boycott and felt that they had not
been given a chance to prove
their worth, one of them saying
he did not know if he was any use.
1973
Mo'oney returns to limelight
3 years since last confrontation
with Mooney
Cockroaches and mice in
refectory
'We must not be complacent, but
at least the situation is not as bad
as in other parts of Kensington.'
That is how D r Levy, Chairman
of the Refectory Committee,
summed up the infestation of the
kitchens by mice at Thursday's
Refectory Committee meeting.
The meeting was told it would
be necessary to spend £3,350 to
disinfect the refectory area of
cockroaches and mice. This sum
included £1,250 to pay for steam
cleaning and £1,000 for washing
down walls.
P o l i c e !
The College authorities went to
tremendous lengths last week to
try to prevent too many students
paying the old price for refectory
meals.
They preferred to take good
food from the students and
T H R O W IT A W A Y rather than
allow students to pay the old
price. The police were even called
in the hope that they would be
able to force students to pay
College's inflated prices instead
of last year's price.
Mr Dawson, College security
officer, warned that students
would be liable to prosecution
under the Theft Act for refusing
to accept the inflated College
price.
