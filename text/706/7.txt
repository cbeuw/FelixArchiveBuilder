GOODBYE MOONEY! J
It took the efforts of one
man for thirty years to
make the IC Refectories
what they are today. That
man was
Victor
Mooney
Mooney came to IC in 1953.
For thefirstfew years he
and his food were popular.
But while time marched on
Mr Mooney stood
inexorably still.
The quality of the food
declined, criticism became
commonplace.
Here FELIX pays tribute
to Victor Mooney and
catalogues his rise, decline
and fall.
1954
The Refectory has had another
change of management. It has
been running at a loss for almost
as long as anyone could
remember, and three years ago
excessively large losses—£5,000
and m o r e — b r o u g h t J o h n
Gardner & Co to cut them down.
This they managed to a certain
extent, cutting the losses by
about 40%. The cut was brought
about partly no doubt by
i m p r o v e d e f f i c i e n c y a n d
economy, but partly too by a
reduction in the total number of
meals served.
The contract with Messrs
Gardner was terminated on Dec
23rd, and M r Mooney is the new
manager. A great improvement
was noticed last term in the
quality and value of the food
being served, and it is to be hoped'
that the new manager will
continue the improvement. A n
increase in prices at this time
would be disastrous, and can
only result in a further drop in the
continued overleaf
number of meals served. As the
overheads remain the same, it
will mean a definite increase in
percentage losses, though the
absolute loss may be less. We
notice that the Suggestions Book
has been absent for a long time
from its normal perch. Surely this
is the time to ask for, and study,
more suggestions from the
consumers?
The possibility of supplies to
the Refectory from Silwood Park
has been studied in great detail by
the Refectory Committee. The
primary aim was to provide
vegetables, but it is found that by
itself this will not be very
l u c r a t i v e . C o u p l e d w i t h
livestock, however, the scheme
can work very profitably, and
would supply, besides vegetables,
eggs, pork, bacon and chicken.
The difficulty lies in the large
initial outlay that will be involved
in getting 45 acres under
cultivation. The matter is being
further studied.
S a l a d
D a y s
Complaints about the reduction
in the number of l/7d dishes in
the lower dining hall are
completely unjustified. The
appearance of a greater number
of higher priced dishes has led to
the conclusion that there has
been a reduction in the quantity
of cheaper dishes available.
Figures show that during a
certain period, 147 different
dishes were offered at l/7d, as
compared with 87 at l/9d and 40
at 2 / - a n d above. T h e
misconception has arisen from
attempts to introduce a wider
choice of dishes, an effort which
should be welcomed by all using
this refectory.
1955
Refectory Progresses
The Refectory is at last showing
signs of recovery. Losses in the
last two terms have slowly
diminished, and there is reason to
hope that they will eventually
vanish completely. The only meal
which consistently runs at a loss
is breakfast, and it seems
inevitable that it will continue to
do so until more custom is found.
The progress is due mainly to
the efforts of the new manager
M r Mooney, in close co-
operation with the Catering sub-
committee. Readers must have
noticed that quite apart from
food, small things like new lights,
more water jugs, racks for trays
on the sides of the tables and so
on have made the Refectory a far
better place than of old. It is to be
hoped that the improvement
continues.
