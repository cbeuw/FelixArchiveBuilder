The
President's
underpants
are missing
Our glorious President M r Bull is
now well-known as a 'one
woman man'. He is firmly
attached to last year's President
Gaynor Lewis.
In his younger days though, he
was a bit of a lad, by all accounts.
In his second year he lived in a
flat in Chiswick. Together with
his flat-mate and the rest of Mech
Eng 2, he got drunk the night
exams finished. They got back to
the flat and crashed out. Next
door lived gorgeous, pouting 19
y e a r - o l d K a r e n , a hotel
receptionist.
During the night, Ian decided
he needed to go for a slash, and so
he went downstairs in his
underpants, to the toilet. On the
way back he happened to meet
Karen.
'You're not got much on, have
you?', said Karen.
Ian, pissed as he was,
i m m e d i a t e l y removed his
underpants and paraded naked
around Karen.
Of course Ian didn't remember
this next morning and it wasn't
until the next evening, when
Karen produced the underpants
and related the story, that Ian
and his flat-mate learnt what had
happened.
