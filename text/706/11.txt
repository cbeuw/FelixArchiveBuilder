PREVIEWS
SINGLES
45'P*
Bill Withers: Oh Yeah
I do like Bill Withers very
much. He sings like Lionel
Richie but his voice is much
much smoother—like creamy
c h o c o l a t e s a u c e . In this
ballad, typical of the album,
Watching You Watching Me
Bill leaves a lovely warm lilt in
your head, hours after you've
heard the single.
Uriah Heep: Poor Little Rich
Girl
I find Uriah Heep both
dreary and over-American-
ised. This new release is so
cliched it must lack appeal
even to the most hardened
'intellectual rock' fan.
Sunset Gun: Sister
After the overproduction of
Mr Heep, it is refreshing to see
anything credited as having
been recorded in Chipping
N o r t o n ! U n f o r t u n a t e l y ,
despite a somewhat sixties
mood to the record the song
itself is bland and lacks
originality. We've all heard
rubbish like this hundreds of
times before. Pulp pop.
The Icicle Works: All The
Daughters (Of Her Father's
House)
Last year, all the music
press were tipping this band
as the next Ultravox. Perhaps
because of these overexpect-
ations (perhaps not) little has
been heard of them since.
However it is good to hear
from this new single, that all
the talent has not deserted
them. With a stylish rock
backing (almost biting indie
edge!!) but colourful brass
and guitar work (similar to the
Dexys) this is really jolly good
stuff.
Madonna: Crazy For You
From another of those awful
pop movies, this is released
from the soundtrack. A bit of a
departure really from the Like
A Virgin-Material Girl-
sound, M a d o n n a has not
cleaned up her awful looks but
has at least cleaned up her
vocal style. I honestly hope
this is a big hit over here; it
would be great to be able to
take M a d o n n a s e r i o u s l y
again.
'Til Tuesday: Voices Carry
The music can probably
best be compared with early
Pretenders, plusthe inevitable
synths. One thing it is nice to
see is m e a n i n g f u l , n o n -
political lyrics again.' I just
wish the female vocalist would
stop trying to imitate Toyah!

Wanted urgently sponsors to
raise money for the British

Manager will be riding the
London to Brighton bike ride
on 30 June, so I need either
individual sponsors or monies
for this very worthy cause,
rumour has it that Dave Parry
is considering a pound a mile
to help me out of my mythical
rut. Consider if you all only
put 10p in the kitty it would
soon mount up, and our many
illustrious authors w h o s e
books we sell very success-
fully, share some of your
royalties with this worthy
cause.

Undergraduate Research
The UROP scheme, which is now in its fifth year, gives
undergraduates the chance to participate in research in the College.
The 1985 directory of opportunities has just been published and, for
the first time, contains offers from every Department and Centre in
the College. Copies are available in your departmental general office
or from Professor J C Anderson, Elec Eng Dept.
The name of the game is participation. Using the directory you can
decide on what line of research interests you and go and see the
member of staff concerned. If all goes well you can mutually arrange
what you will be doing, when, for how long and whether it will include
paid work in the Summer vacation. The Supervisor has to find the
money and how much he pays you is a matter for negotiation between
you; we lay down a maximum of £70 pw and the usual period is not
more than 10 weeks. The method of payment is by a student bursary,
which means you do not pay NHI or income tax and you do not need a
work permit.
What we are not doing is trying to get cheap labour in the
laboratories. UROP has a serious educational purpose, which is to
give undergraduates the opportunity to learn how research is done
and, hopefully, make a contribution to the project they join. You can
continue to participate during the term (in your own time) and, with
luck, may find your name on a published paper or a share in a patent.
At the very least, participation can give you a flying start at the project
work which is part of your course. In other words this is not just
another summer job opportunity and, if you can afford it, it is worth
doing even for nothing!
During the summer term we will run small-ads in FELIX for specific
jobs on offer for this summer which are not in the directory.
If you want further help or advice do not hesitate to come and see
me.
