Noted
Mr Mooney was born in 1923,
and he tells us that his early life
before 1939 was uneventful. He
spent seven years during the war
in the Merchant Navy, and saw
most of the world, but not as an
adviser on cookery! His life as a
catering manager did not start on
Joe's Stall in the Mile End Road;
it started at the Selsdon Park
Hotel in 1946. From that time
onwards, he stayed at the St
James Court Hotel, the Grand
Hotel at Harrogate, and many
others.
In 1953, M r Mooney came to
IC as manager of Union Catering
and since that time has taken
over nearly the whole of the
catering of the College. When he
was asked what he liked, he
replied 'Quieter Carnivals and
trifles that are eaten, not used as
missiles!'.
Any profile of M r Mooney
would be incomplete without a
reference to M r Kitchener.
'At a recent dinner in the
Upper Dining Hall,' said M r
Mooney, 'I put peppercorns in
Kitchener's soup; but he found
them. I put cayenne pepper in the
fish course; but he twigged it. But
I got him at last—I put ginger in
the cherries of the fruit salad, and
I can't tell you what he said to
me!'
Kitchener replied by asking
Mooney to 'come out and have a
good dinner'.
P u k e !
Dear M r Mooney,
The meal I had with you
yesterday is all coming back to
me now. If necessary, I can bring
it up at the next Refectory
Committee meeting.
Q u e u e s
Mr Mooney will shortly begin an
experiment to prevent the
enormous supper queues which
have of late graced the Lower
Refectory. The plan is that he will
guarantee a good selection of
food between 6.00 and 7.30. In
addition the Upper Refectory
will now remain open until 6.30,
which should relieve some of the
pressure downstairs.
1956
Thanks to a magnificent and
determined effort by the
Refectory Manager, M r Mooney,
and his loyal staff, it was possible
to open the Lower Refectory in
time for lunch on Monday,
October 8th. This was despite a
series of setbacks which would
have surely demoralised a lesser
man.
Mr Mooney is one of those
comparative rarities among
administrators who realise that
students are the one essential
ingredient of a college and that
their needs and welfare must
come before all else. He
accordingly set about his colossal
task with his characteristic
refusal to be flustered.
M r M o o n e y h a d been
informed that the kitchens and
Refectory would be available for
him to move in on Thursday,
October 4th, thus giving him
reasonable time to prepare for
the following Monday. Despite
vigorous exhortations from the
Planning Department, the
contractors had to postpone the
availability until 9.00am on
Sunday, giving M r Mooney and
his staff barely a day in which to
prepare for serving about 400
lunches using new and strange
equipment. A senior member of
IC Administration informed the
President that he could not see
how the Refectory could possibly
be used until Friday 12th.
However, 'cometh the hour,
cometh the man'.
But even worse was to come.
On Sunday morning the kitchens
and serving hatch were still
swarming with workmen. M r
Mooney could not start until
4.30pm. The working squad who
were to carry the heavy packages
of equipment from their storing
place in the Snack Bar across to
the Refectory packed up their
bags and went home. Not until
about 6.00pm could M r Mooney
and his kitchen staff begin their
move, and they were assisted by
about eight volunteers from the
Hostel.
On Monday morning the
kitchen was a scene of chaos.
Remnants of painters and tilers
were finishing their work. The
only sign of food was a huge bowl
of steaming soup being
vigorously stirred by 'Kit' who
has been a cook at IC for 30 years
and who knew of worse times
than this during the war. She
shouted cheerfully 'Don't worry
dear. The lads'll have their lunch
at 12.'. Meanwhile dusty plates
had been piled into the new
washing machine. The switch
was pressed, the brushes
revolved—but unfortunately in
the wrong direction, and their
effect was not to clean the plates
but to fling a spray of water all
over the kitchen. Elsewhere M r
Mooney was peering into a large
pan of fat. Dense black smoke
rose into his face and more fat
was flung in to avert a
conflagration. With the kitchen
awash in one corner and
threating to become aflame in the
other, Mooney and Co battled
on, and so over 400 people
obtained their lunch little
realising the drama that had gone
before. It is as well to retain a
sense of humour in such
troublesome times as this.
F e a t h e r !
Dear M r Mooney,
A m o n g the many diverse
ingredients of my cream of
chicken soup this evening, the
only sign of chicken was one
feather. This is a bad thing.
B o y c o t t
Dear Sir,
In view of the fact that the prices
of meals served in the Imeprial
College Refectories are due to be
increased by anything from 6d to
1/6 to make a few comments on
the quality of the food that is
continuously churned out in
large quantities for the
comsumption of a mass of
students whose suggestions and
complaints are always ignored by
those responsible for the catering
arrangements.
I am applaed by the total
indifference displayed by M r
Mooney and his staff. Several
restaurants give better service
and much better food are lower
prices than this so-called non-
profit making organisation. It is
therefore reasonable to assume
that M r Mooney imagines that he
has an absolute monopoly
whereas if students would look
around they would soon realise
how they are being treated.
I therefore advocate a boycott
of Imperial College Refectories
•until such a time as M r Mooney is
capable (a) of providing a
reasonable service and (b) of
meals which are both eatable and
edible.
Yours faithfully,
PJ Cunningham
W i r e !
Dear M r Mooney,
A fortnight ago I was fortunate
enough to find a threepenny bit
in the bottom of my fruit salad,
a b o u t w h i c h I am not
complaining. Please, however,
find enclosed a bundle of wire,
two-thirds of which I had the
misfortune to swallow while
eating your otherwise excellent
apple pie.

When M r Briggs first produced it
in October this year, this volume
was immediately recognised as
indispensable to IC students.
A large part of the book deals
with the complaints and
particularly interesting is the
chapter on peas. M r Mooney's
peas hace been variously
described as lead shot, green
bullets and indigestible ball
bearings, but all contributors
agree that they show little
resemblanmce other than in size
and shape to the natural product.
As they are quite inedible this
form of fish and chip decoration
is one luxury we can do without.
One contributor asked, in rather
bad taste, whether they were in
fact made from real peas or from
some synthetic formula for
which ICR holds the patent. The
C a t e r i n g s u b - C o m m i t t e e
remained ominously silent on
this matter, but it pointed out
that garden peas would increase
the cost of a dish by about 3d. It is
pleasing to note, though, that
evidence of the last few weeks
indicates that a compromise has
been reached, and the peas, if not
tasting of the genuine article, are
at least edible.
Perhaps as typical of the
section dealing with complaints
we may quote:
'The white of an egg was
rubbery, the yolk more so. The
peas were hard except where they
had come into contact with the
egg, which they had dyed an
unnatural shade of green. The
chips were leathery and the whole
dish was quite cold.
The author of these comments
was told to return such dishes to
the counter, to help maintain
good standards.
The eating habits of domestic
animals do not interest the
Catering sub-Committee. A
woodlouse was found exploring
the suet pudding and two days
later five cockroaches were found
in the refectory. Elsewhere we are
informed that a question of
supply and demand determines
the Brinell hardness of chips and
that the square on the cut side of
a sandwich is equal to the sum of
the squares on the crusty sides.
As a final educational extract we
quote:
'For some time I have been
confused regarding engineering
terms: ductility, rigidity, tensile
strength, hardness, brittleness.
Your pastry demonstrates them
all'.
R u b b e r !
Dear M r Mooney,
If you must serve up rubber
bands with your kidney turbigo,
would you mind cutting them up
into small pieces, as your knives
are not sharp enough for me to
cut them myself.
1963
Dear Sir,
I am prompted to write this letter
only through sheer force of
circumstances. After reading in
the latest F E L I X that a survey is
to be made on dining conditions,
I feel that I must get my spoke in
as a mere Fresher.
My main complaints concern
the lower refectory in the Union
Building.
1. Filthy glasses.
2. Cutlery semi-washed.
3. The flat plates on which the
puddings are put radiate heat
quite efficiently. Result: cold.
4. Not enough large trays for
soup lovers; those of us who are
not trained juglers are liable to be
dogged by the smell for the rest of
the afternoon.
5. The servers look and talk as
if they have 'stood enough cheek
from you,' especially one who
will not allow anyone to wait for
fish, and another who puts peas
on beside all the fish and becomes
offended if one wants anything
else.
6. Inpenetrable sausages.
7. Chairs which knock
everyone else's elbows.
Yours faithfully,
D D Williams
Old c r o c k
Since the 1st October this session,
large quantities of crockery and
cutlery have disappeared from
the refectory: 250 large knives,
140 small knives, 180 dessert
spoons, 130 teaspoons, 80 large
forks and 570 cups. M r Henry,
the Security officer, was of the
opinion that by far the majority
of the missing articles would be
accounted for by people
borrowing, but forgetting to
return them. He suggested that a
search in the Hostel might bring
to light vast quantities of
M o o n e y m e r c h a n d i s e as
happened when the Hostel was
redecorated last summer.
1964
The Royal Army Education
Corps' display in the top
refectory attracted many visitors.
The officers accompanying the
exhibition were extremely
friendly and said that they were
deeply impressed with the
atmosphere in this ' r e a l '
university and that they found all
students very courteous. Major
Harper, ex-President of Durban
University, seriously said that the
food in the upper refectory was
the best and cheapest he had
sampled out of 27 universities.
