Brewer's Dray at head of Carni-
val Procession last Saturday
Dear Sir,
From the Evening Standard*
Saturday May the 2nd.:
LAST WORD
"As part of the training of stu-
dents taking City and Guilds agri-
cultural courses it is necessary for
them to pass proficiency tests in
certain tasks related to livestock.
For this purpose they obviously
luive to undergo castration, infec-
tions and ear marking."—From
a report by the Principal of an
Institute of Agriculture.
Please dont let us be too proud
to accept writs from other Guilds-
men*.
Yours very sincerely(I)
CRISPIN PINEY, Maths I
* (are Guildsmen therefore Sub-
standard?)
Sir,
With regard to the letter ap-
pearing in Felix dated I8//1 March
1964, we were not ^responsible
for the letter appearing above our
signature, and do not repeat NOT
withdraw our original remarks
which were factual statements of
our own personal opinion.
Yours faithfully.
The Long arid the Short
and the Tall
Sir.
May I take this opportunity to
congratulate the persons respon-
sible for the organisation behind
the May Ball. I enjoyed myself
very much, and looking around I
think most other people did too.
The decor was magnificent—es-
pecially the Blue Room, and
organisation also was very good.
If any criticism is to be levelled,
it is perhaps that the bars were
not as Jully equipped as they
might have been, and that they
ran out too early, but on the
whole the evening was one of the
most enjoyable and successful
formal occasions held this year in
London University. Once again,
my congratulations.
A Woman from Bedford.

Dear Sir,
Whilst applauding your efforts
in bringing out a Carnival Supple-
ment, 1 think that the original
intentions of a Carnival seem to
have been lost. I can well under-
stand that Messrs Bishop and
Wharton wish to publicise them-
selves as fully as possible but
surely this was not the most
appropriate moment. A bit less
Yog atxd a bit more Mental
Health would have been more in
keeping with the occasion. The
whole thing reeks of Bishop from
beginning to end; why not stick
to English and abandon the all
pervading puerile style which
makes such bad reading.
Yours,
ANTIYOG.

Dear Sir,
Through your columns 1 Should
like to ask the co-operation of
everyone who was in Weeks Hall
on the evening of Saturday March
2\st at the end of last term. The
Boat Club will remember it as the
day of the Putney Head of the
River race, and many joined a
party in Weeks Hall that evening.
Between 10.30 p.m. that even-
ing and 9.0 a.m. the next Sunday
morning a suitcase containing
clothes, shoes, passport, Insur-
ance policies. Post Office book,
over 150 colour slides and photo-
graphs, and many personal and
business letters was stolen from
the entrance to Weeks Hall, where
it was awaiting collection by
British Road Services. As yet
the police have been unable to
trace it. The theft was made pos-
sible by the door being left un-
locked by party-goers, together
with tlie case not being locked
away for the weekend by the
person then responsible for it.
(Not me. The college have taken
responsibility for it.)
If anyone who was in Weeks
Hall on that date can remember
either having seen this buff-col-
oured metal airline suitcase, or
not lutving seen it, will he please
contact Peter Jenkins, Weeks
Hall, Room 44, Int. 094.
Yours faithfully,
PETER A. JENKINS
