SWIMMING
TOUR
The swimming team sailed to
Holland for a week despite one
member having his cracked head
sewn up. The first day in Am-
sterdam began in the Bols
Genever Tavern followed by a
3 hour training session during
which two matches, for that
evening, were arranged. The
European 400 metres champion
was too fast and won the Polo
match for Amsterdam Free Uni-
versity 7-1. The second polo
match, only two hours later, was
lost 8-3 to Dolphijn, a local
swimming club, after a predomi-
nantly level game. Visits to
Amstel and Heiniken breweries
preceded a cultural day at the art
galleries and a soiree of bedtime
stories from " Fanny Hill."
Win at Delft
The last three days were spent
at Delft with trips to The Hague
and the unpronouncable Scheven-
ingen. Our old friends at Delft
Student Corp gave us a dinner
and presented us with dutch clay
pipes which we smoked at the
time; we presented them with an
I.C. tankard which was much
appreciated. After this we had
the match and clinched a victory
in the swimming with a win in the
100 metres free-style by Paul
Morris who raised his personal
best time by 4 sees to 64. We lost
the polo 4-1 in a " tight match "
but won the next round in their
union by out-drinking them.
Anglo-Dutch relations were fur-
thered even more the next day at
a party. We slipped through the
customs after getting well oiled
on the boat back. We have since
been invited to the wedding of
Floor Anthoni who's last claim to
fame at I.C. is that whilst here
with Delft last year he " made the
acquaintance o f " this year's
Carnival Queen.
Ten girls of I.C.W.A. put their male counterparts to shame at this
year's U.L. Athletics Championships. In the face of opposition from
such female strongholds as Bedford, Westfield and Q.E.C. our girb~
won not only the Sherwood Cup (based on a College factor scoring
system), but also the Imperial College Union Challenge Cup (which
is based on the maximum number of points, regardless of the college
factor).
Our men could only manage
second place, behind U.C., in
their Championship.
Although none of our girls
could be classed as outstanding
athletes, they turned out in such
jump in a " jump-off " decision.
Perhaps our best track perform-
ance was by Joe Fitzsimmons

events where the entry was poor.
And if there had been a prize
for good looks, I imagine ICWA
would have won that too. Not
only did we have the newly—
fledged Carnival Queen showing
her paces in the 220 yards, but
also many of the prettier college
faces showing surprising form in
events as diverse as the 440 yards
and the high jump.
The men were let down a bit,
by their track team. In the field
events they were well represented
by Dave Smith, who won the
triple jump, Derek Wade and
Smith, who were first and second
in the long jump and Leon Hall,
who was just second in the high

RELAY
Once again I.C. shows the way
—this time in road running. The
Cross Country Club were success-
ful in their Easter attempt to run
from Fort William to Caenarvon
via the three highest mountains—
an original venture.
The team, weakened by injury
to three of our first team, was a
very young one; only three run-
neers over twenty. Our strength
lay in our mountain runners and,
in spite of snow on the top, Ben
Nevis was negotiated in only 2hr.

RUGBY GOES WEST
Over Easter seventeen under-
strength, I.C. rugby players and
two un-official officials went west
and shattered the peace and quiet
of glorious Devon.
Basing themselves on Torquay
(the beer's better there) they
turned out, for the first time since
October in clean shirts, against
Paignton. However typical Devon
rain and 6 ins. of mud soon re-
stored things to normal and we
finished the first half 3-0 up,
thanks to a push over by Joe
Collins. After several failures
FFESTIVE FFAGINS
As a fitting climax to the
season, ffagins X V lurched their
way to the tourist paradise of
Southend-on-Sea, ostensibly to
take part in the Annual Easter
Rugby Festival (the largest in the
world, folks).
The party included three ladies,
and an enjoyable time was had by
all, except John Richardson, who
thrice involved ye wrath of ye
local Constabulary.
The matches were arranged to
coincide with closing hours, and
during these dry spells ffagins
swiftly crushed Southall Tech.
23-0 and Southend " B " 27-6.
The swerving runs of Derek
Topliss mystified everyone until
it was noticed that he had only
one boot, the other having rotted
away (" Who's been puking in
M Y boots ?").
Despite the local landladies
(" I'm not having those women
in here! ") it is hoped to return
next Easter.
a penalty was eventually conver-
ted and with a concerted effort by
the backs failing to produce more
points the game was closed at
6-0.
The Rot Sets In
Such success could not last and
the following evening we lost to
Kingsbridge. R. Harris, a hero
of the Paignton match was carried
off after 10 minutes and from then
on the weight of numbers proved
too great; the final score being 11-
3 to ihe natives.
Newton Abbot provided the
toughest opposition and in spite
of some inspired jumping by the
forwards we were 3-0 down at
mid-way. Refreshed by the tra-
ditional orange A. Butler scored a
spectacular second-half try, dash-:
ing 65 yds to level the score! But
it wasn't converted and a last-
minute penalty to the enemy lost
us the game at 6-3.
Sorrowful Sevens
More due to a "misunderstand-
ing " over travelling arrangements
than to the opposition the sevens
were soon eliminated from an
Easter Monday Tournament at
Bridlington. Then drunk but
happy I.C. 1st X V dispersed to
the far corners of the country and
Devonians heaved a sigh of relief.
3 peaks team at Caernarvon
The Open Road
Then, using an old eighteenth
century military road over the
mountains, we set off for Scafell.
Everything, like the weather, was
going fine 'til just beyond Glas-
gow (how we found our way
through there is a mystery) when
Gerry Horsley, unaccompanied
for once by his dormobile, almost
collapsed and was reduced nearly
to a walk.
Thus a man short we reached
Scafell on the Friday-afternoon
and with a strong wind and
unexpectedly tough going Terry
Servant and Tim Millward took
2 hrs. 32 mts.
Over the Mersey
By Ellesmere Port on the Satur-
day morning we were effectively
three men short and it was de-
cided to run the last 60 miles
parlauff fashion in 2\, 2 and
finally 1 mile stages. This took
us to Pen-y-Pass by 4.0 p.m. on
the Saturday and Snowdon, in
just about ideal conditions, was
negotiated in 1 hr. 32 mts.
From there it was just 8 miles
to Caernavon (to finish, as we
had started, in the sea), the last
i mile being a mass sprint with
Alan Walker (who had run the
farthest and the fastest) being the
one to get his feet wet, just 56 hrs.
10 mts. since we had started.
After a brief par ; for photo-
graphs there was another mass
sprint—it was opening time.
