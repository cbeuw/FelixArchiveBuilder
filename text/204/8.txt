Y o u h a v e r e a d a l l t h e l e a f l e t s , m a d e v i s i t s , a t t e n d e d i n t e r v i e w s . And now
perhaps you have a difficult choice to make.
Ask yourself this key question: which company is most strongly linked to the pattern of
economic growth ?
Turner & Newall is one of the strongest, most important—though least publicised—groups in
British industry. And with a large and growing stake in asbestos-cement, in insulation, in
brake linings and in plastics T&N is closely linked to all four major areas of economic growth.
To the building industry; the motor industry; the newer plastics; and to activity in the under-
developed territories of the Commonwealth.
T&N thus offers outstanding graduates a career of great scope, keyed from the start to the
areas in which expansion is at its fastest... opportunity at its best. Remember too that under
T&N's broad and flexible training scheme, the graduate assumes managerial responsibility
more confidently—and certainly earlier—than is often the case in industry today.
Note to Research Men T&N also recruit scientists and engineers direct into its
research branches, whose projects are particularly closely linked to the needs of the
expanding industries. Group spending on research is rising every year.

SPORTS DAY
Sports Day came and Sports
Day went and scarcely a drop of
rain fell on the proceedings. In
this respect it was an improve-
ment on last year's effort, when
the first race was run with an inch
of water on the track. In actual
athletic content, however, it didn't
really compare.
True, there were some exciting
finishes, notably in the mile relay
and the hurdles, but the stars of
last year were seriously missed.
R.C.S. won the Governors'
Trophy by 162 points to 142 from
C & G again. This year the finish
wasn't quite as close, although the
result was in the balance until
three events before the end. Mines
obtained a shock double victory
in the triple jump but failed to
win any other event except the
Staff Race (a second double vic-
tory, by Mr. Grierson and Dr.
Bulter) which didn't count. They
trailed respectfully 58 points be-
hind Guilds at the end.
