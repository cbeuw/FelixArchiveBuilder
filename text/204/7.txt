In the North of the Duchv, the
deep forested valleys of the
Ardennes gave good walking,
while in the east, the caverns,
gorges and cliffs of the " Petite
Suisse " region seem to belong to
a lost world.
The hostels varied from primi-
tive to modern, but one of the
most interesting was the feudal
castle at Hollenfels. The people
we met were industrious and
friendly; one evening the girls in
our party found themselves sere-
naded by a lad of forty with a
harmonica. The appearance of
his irate wife, near closing time,
caused the .locals great amuse-
ment. We returned via Koblenz
where a visit to the Deinhard wine
cellars, nearly three centuries old,
made a pleasant climax.
Scottish Porridge
On Easter Sunday, another
party were heading over rough
Scottish roads, via Loch Laggan
to Ratagan. After climbing the
Sisters of Klentail, the sea was
crossed to Skye and Glenbrittle
hostel. The warden here migrates
south in Winter to play Santa
Claus at a large London store.
Several days were spent enjoy-
ing magnificent weather walking
and scrambling in the buillins.
While there, an interesting job
involved carting four hundred tins
of stewed steak for the warden—
not all Scotsmen appear to live
on porridge! The party returned
by Fort William and Ben Crua-
chan finishing with a 480 mile
dash to London.
On the first weekend of term,
some people once more attempted
the Lyke Wake W a l k ^ O miles
over the highest and broadest
parts of the North York Moors.
Balls come and Balls go. Some
are good and some not too good.
This year's May Ball was one of
the better ones. Evidence of lav-
ish preparations abounded every-
where. More people, more
flowers, more decorations, more
bands and more cabarets than any
other Ball on the I.C. Calendar.
The May Ball also sees the
choosing of the Carnival Queen
Some were confirmed addicts;
others new to the cult. Starting
just after 3.00 a.m. (and in poor
weather) six of the ten starters
finished in under eighteen hours.
Now recovered, they claim to
have enjoyed it. Later on this
term, we are hoping to attempt
the South Wales Marathon. Wish
us luck !
and four pretty girls assembled in
the early hours of the morning to
be judged. Congratulations to
Lyn Curtis, the winner, who only
hours before the start of the Ball,
had been lona-ju'mping for the
victorious I.C.W.A. athletics
team. Its good to see an
I.C.W.A-rian winning anyw»y!
Points to Criticise. The bars
were very short of the right drinks,
the cabaret was unusually dull
and the lower dancing floor was
largely unusable because of un-
suitable bands.
Points to commend. The ex-
cellent value for money one re-
ceived and the superbly conceived
decor.
Thought for the future—why
not try having a May Ball over at
South Side?
Quote: from a lady at the above,
bitterly,
" I only saw a few flowers, and
Hodgson's feet were in those."
