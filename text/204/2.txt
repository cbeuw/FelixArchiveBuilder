BRAIN DRAIN
Cont. from p. 1
It is rather unfortunate
that the price of an American
haircut (about 10/-) is all too
often quoted as an indication of
their cost of living. This, he
contended to be the worst pos-
sible example which could be
cited—chosen, presumably, to be
deliberately distant. However, to
put things in perspective, he ex-
plained that houses are very much
cheaper, and after all, a roof over
one's head is the thing in life
which people want more than
anything else. Cars are not unduly
expensive. Petrol is certainly
much cheaper—and so it goes on.
To continue the argument,
starting salaries were quoted. A
man with a Ph.D. in this country
can expect to begin life with about
£1,100 a year. In the States, a
typical sVarting )pay is about
£3,500 ayear; and without a Ph.D.
200 guineas a month.
Better Facilities
Equally important are the fa-
cilities which provide for research.
The impression was given that
they are very much better in the
States than in this country—for
example, at Princeton where there
are 4,000 students, only a propor-
tion of which are studying tech-
nology, there are six computers
available for student's use. A t
I.C. where there are a compar-
able number of Science students,
we have to fight for any time at
all on the University of London
Computing Unit.
Britain Breeding Technologists
for Export
The brain drain was welcomed
in some quarters. It was argued
that since Britain has very little
to offer to the world in the way of
raw materials, then why not en-
courage the mass production of
Scientists for use abroad. After
all, British industry doesn't seem
to know what to do with its en-
gineers, and we really do seem to
have more than enough (despite
Robbins and others). The Gaelic
outburst with which we began is
reasonable evidence of this. How-
ever, the brain drain allows for a
two way traffic, so there is no
reason why we should come out
losers—or is there?
4-Hour Day
One member of staff who was
questioned had some views on ihe
state of British industry. He
claimed that it is undercapitalised,
and that the output, per man, is
very low. He agreed that there
are not enough jobs available for
those being trained. The threat of
nationalisation frightened others
who were questioned. Has British
industry anything to offer at all?
—" Sure—a nice relaxed way of
life. You know, in this country
you really have it cushy—you
only do an effective 4 hour day,
and you get more tea-breaks than
you would anywhere else in the
world."
The fact that the engineer in
this country is badly paid may be

are to make available, free of
charge, a very powerful IBM 7090
data processing system, a smaller
IBM 1401 data processing system
for data preparation and output,
and appropriate peripheral equip-
ment. A 7090 Computing Centre
is to be set up by Imperial College
which will provide facilities and
staff. It will be directed by Pro-
fessor Stanley Gill, recently ap-
pointed to the new Chair of Com-
puting Science and to the Direc-
torship of the College Computer
Unit.
The College has long been
aware of the essential contribu-
tion that large automatic compu-
ters make to its research pro-
gramme. Over 1,800 academic
staff, research assistants and post-
graduate students with a wide
range of interests covering many
highly specialised fields in science
and technology are making in-
creasing demands for computing
facilities. The problems which
they are continuously generating
as a result of their research activi-
ties are of a type rarely met else-
where in magnitude or difficulty.
The IBM 7090 installation will
greatly extend not only the am-
ount of computing work which
can be undertaken, but also the
diversity of the problems which
can be tackled, the training which
can be given, and the experience
which can be acquired in con-
junction with the University of
London Computer Unit with
which the College already has a
direct link.
Some Facts on the IBM 7090 and
IBM 1401
The IBM 7090 Data Processing
System is a very powerful second
generation computer, many of
which are installed throughout the
World. The 7090 to be ihstalled
at Imperial College has a " Me-
mory " of 32,768 words and is
equipped with 8 magnetic tape
files. Instructions are read and
interpreted in 2.18 millionths of a
second; a complete addition or
subtraction, for instance, takes as
little as 4.36 millionths of a
second.
The 1401 is the. most widely
used computer in the World. It
can operate both as a computer
in its own right and as a means of
preparing input for the 7090 in
the form of magnetic tape (read-
ing cards at up to 800 per minute),
and similarly converting the 7090
magnetic tape output into printed
matter (printing up to 600 lines a
minute) or punched cards.

ciety.
Mention the word engineer
and one immediately conjures
up the image of a grotty little man
in grotty overalls, digging a hole
in the road. The term engineer
in the States is reserved for a man
with a degree. However, since the
Americans are hot status Con-
scious to anywhere near the same
extent as the British, this doesn't
really seem to matter. So, where
do we go from here? Do we
stick it out in the Motherland, or
get the hell out! One bearded
gentleman summed up the situa-
tion with his typical urbanity,
" It's only a parochial problem,
so who cares anyway?"

INSIDE 7
JOB I
STILL M O R E THEFTS
A Locked room in Beit Old
Hostel was broken into at the end
of last term, and clothes taken
from a wardrobe. The thief was
evidently in haste as he missed a
more valuable suit which was
lying on a chair.
Whether it was an inside job
or not, is not immediately appar-
ent. As every key in the hostel
fits at least half of the doors, the
theft could have been carried out
by any occupant. However the
locks are of such an antiquated
and unsatisfactory nature that a
small amount of skill with a piece
of wire would be as equally effec-
tive means of entrance as a key.
Also an outsider might easily go
unnoticed in the Hostel at the end
of term when parents are walking
in and out carrying handfuls of
luggage.

So only this: these particular Top People must
Keep themselves fully and widely informed.
They must be aware not only of happenings
in their particular field, but of discussion and
comment on questions of the day, internation'
al news, politics and the arts. For all this, they
turn to THE TIMES.
You may not want to be a top don or top
teacher: lots of people don't. But the same is
true of top civil servants, top businessmen,
top politicians. Whatever kind of top person
you hope to be, it's not too early to get in
training now by taking THE TIMES regularly.
Especially since, as a student, you're entitled
to it at half price: ask your newsagent or
write to THE TIMES Subscription Manager.

that this is a little less than seven-tenths: please
do not write to point this out. Do write, however,

they think on the important issues of the day?
