Even it you cannot spare the
time to go to hops, this term,
there is no reason why you
should not revise, or at least brush
up your technique; I doubt that
there is anyone who has not once
received a chilling " Thank you,"
or, worse still " If you must sing
the words, why not sing in tune?"
or the sign of pure desperation
" you must excuse me, but I must
sit down and take your weight off
my feet."
The first elementary rules to
follow are: do not be rude, be
rough, be mean, or B.O.
What you must remember is
that very few women wander
round like a doctor's tonic with
a label on them saying: " Pick-
me-up, to be taken three times a
jay." and they should not be well
ihaken on meeting you.
The openings ot the hop-hunter
—and I do not mean the beer-
drinker's mouth—are many and
varied: there is of course the
conventional " would you like
like to dance?" technique, and
innumerable styles up to the
" would you mind removing your
boots? I've got thin shoes on,"
jocular approach; by now, you
must have some idea of what suits
you, or be going steady with a
well-worn brown bag.
The preceding paragraphs were
quite elementary, but the big
question is: what do you do after
the ice—and you—are well and
truly shattered? Shake on until
you die of syringomyelia (anyone
who wishes to know more about
this disease should send a
stamped addressed coffin, by

U.N. I.C. CAMBRIDGE
On first sight these three names seem to have very little in com-
mon. However, on the last Thursday of the Spring Term when many
were already getting into the holiday spirit, 17 IC students (including
4 ICWArians) travelled down to Cambridge in order to attend the
1st Model Assembly of the United Nations. The conference was
sponsored by the Sunday Times and it was the first of its kind held
in England.
As the name implies the assembly was to work on similar lines
to that in New York except that each country was represented by
students. IC provided the delegations for Afghanistan, Burma, Cam-
bodia, Laos and Siam. The aim of the assembly was to interest
students jn the working of the United Nations and the countries which
they represented. Furthermore, the conference gave us an excellent
opportunity to meet students from other universities in the U.K.
The Assembly was formally opened by the Mavor of Cambridge
on Friday and it was subsequently presided over by Frederick Boland,
a former president of the U.N. General Assembly.
The first debate which was on gation (although he opposed her
the " World Situation " revealed
that many of the Afro-Asian
countries were strongly in favour
of the admission to the U.N. of
Red China instead of Nationalist
China. The Cambodian delega-
tion was no exception as could be
heard when Andrew Wilson de-
livered his exciting speech calling
for the recognition of Communist
China and the withdrawal of
American influence in South East
Asia. When the Nationalist
Chinese delegate wanted to ad-
dress the assembly, almost half of
the 100 present delegations left
the hall in protest. However, the
hall in protest. However, the
Chinese speaker was extremely
eloquent and most delegates could
be found listening to the loud
speaker transmission.
The second day was spent de-
bating the situation in South
Africa and a permanent U N
Force. The African delegates
felt very strongly about this sub-
ject and wanted to impose severe
economic sanctions against the
Republic. However, due to the
skillful coloured Fiji law student
who led the South African dele-
attitude personally) and the influ-
ence of the Western countries
only moderate sanctions such ns
an embargo on military goods
and petroleum were called for.
The conference ended on Sun-
day with a debate on " Develop-
ment" which concerned the emer-
ging countries. Most countries
called for increased trade and im-
proved prices for primary pro-
ducts but very little was said
about education. The Afghan
delegation could pass a resolution
asking for more educational facili-
ties in the richer countries, but no
agreement could be reached about
educational and technical aid.
We all left Cambridge with a
feeling of achievement and of
course it was comforting to know
that IC provided most delegations
of all the universities in the U.K.
except for Oxford and Cambridge
which organized the assembly.
The assembly was very success-
ful and the standard of debating
very high. The "Sunday Times"
is now considering having another
assembly next year, probably in
London and possibly at I.C. . . .
