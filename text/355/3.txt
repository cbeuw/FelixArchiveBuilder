FLOOR REPS
lit has come to the notice
•of floor reps that a lot of
people in I.C. just do not
know what floor reps are,
who they are, and what
they do. What follows,
ihen, is an attempt to en-
lighten the unenlightened.
There are six floor reps
on I.C.U. Council:—
John Berry—Physics 3.
Caroline Bingham —
Physics 3.
Charlie Lewis—Mech.
Eng. 3.
Nigel Sedgwick—Phy-
sics 3.
Paul Watkins—Mech.
Eng. P G .
Mike Williams—Chem-
istry 3.
There is a yawning
chasm between the ideality
and practicality of their
position, the blame for
which chiefly lies at the
feet of the electorate.
Ideally, they represent the
views of the ordinary
Union members and put
forward ideas as such at
Council and UGMs, In
practice floor reps tend to
have their own particular
views and one then votes
at the election (which
takes place at a U G M in
the summer term) for
whichever candidate repre-
sents one's own views the
most closely. Again ideally
the Union's rank and file
approach the floor reps
and ask them to put their
views on a particular
issue forward; but in prac-
tice the rank and file are
so bloody apathetic that
the floor reps have no
choice but to keep on
slogging on with their own
views in the belief that
they broadly coincide with
that rare and diffuse entity
—the ^grass-roots opinion'.
So it appears that too
many people are content
to pass the buck in terms
of responsibility inasmuch
as they themselves reap
the benefits from their effi-
ciently run, well financed
societies. Yes, it's (he root
of the apathy syndrome.
The Union Floor Com-
mittee, consisting of the
six floor reps, was formed
essentially to breach this
yawning gap between
ideality and practicality,
and to discuss the com-
munications problems fac-
ing I.C.U. a n d t h e
approaches to solving the
same.
I can tell you that I have
a private wager that what
follows will be completely
disregarded by the smug
apathites of I.C.: "We
need your views. If you
feel strongly about some-
thing tell us; if you want
to propose something at a
U G M but are a bit Shy
about it. tell us. That's
what we're here for".
O.K. I've said it. So now
there's no excuse for not
knowing what a floor
rep's function is.

SEX ATTITUDES MUST
BE HONEST
In the second of a series of World
Population Year talks, organised by the
Family Planning Association, Professor
Ned Wagner of Washington University
said that society must be more open and
honest about sexual behaviour. "If a
man has a heart attack, for example,
the doctors will tell him how soon he
could get up again, how much exercise
to give various limbs, but not how much
sexual activity he can have.
"Until August 1970 there was not a
single study in medical literature on the
effect of sexual intercourse upon a dam-
aged heart", he said. "Even that is of
limited value in that it was carried out
on 14 middle-aged, middle-class Ameri-
can Jews, which is hardly representa-
tive".
Professor Wagner, who is on a sabba-
tical year from the university where he
is Professor of Psychology and
Obstetrics/Gynaecology and Director of
Clinical Training in the Department of
Psychology, also said that nobody in the
world has had sufficient sex education.
This leads to unwanted children who
often grow up disturbed in some way.
Criminals, assassins, etc., often fall into
this category.
He believes that this situation has
been influenced by religious doctrine
which links procreation with sex be-
haviour and therefore holds that sex
outside marriage is bad. This grew up at
a time when pro-natalist policies were
necessary. But he thinks that religion
has an important part to play in chang-
ing this attitude to a more realistic one.
Professor Wagner's guide lines for sex
education in schools are:
Sexuality is an integral part of an
individual's total personality; People
have a right to objective and full inform-
ation about sexuality; Privacy concern-
ing the personal behaviour of both
students and teachers is sacrosanct;
Sexual behaviour which is held to be
within the acceptable range will vary
from person to person and from group
to group. A concensus may not be pos-
sible. Divergent views should be respect-
ed if they are based on principles of
honesty and acceptability: Individuals
who teach sex education have a respon-
sibility to be properly trained and
qualified persons.
Professor Wagner summed up by say-
ing that everyone has a right to know-
ledge of isex to enable them to make
choices and not act out of ignorance.
He also made the point that parents are
often inhibited by their own education
and personal relationships in instructing
their children and therefore more sex
education in schools was essential. He,
for instance, would much rather get the
message across to his own three Children
(aged 17, 11 and 10) by means of a
lecture to a large audience than in
private.
RADIO SURVEY
As a lot of you will know by now, a survey was held throughout the halls of
residence regarding the setting up of a student radio station.
Below is a list of some of the questions thai were asked and the results that were
obtained.
1) Do you ever watch Stoic?
3) How much of Felix do you
usually read?
5) Would you like I.C. to have its
own radio?
2) Do you read Felix regularly?
4) Do you own a medium wave radio?
6) Would you listen to such a Radio
Station?
10) Do you think I.C. should spend up to £1,200 setting up such a station which
would cost £350 p.a. to run; Felix costs £2,000 p.a. Yes/Nb.

GENERAL ELECTION
MEETING
On Tuesday, 19tih February a General
Election Meeting was held. Despite the
unavoidable short notice quite a large
crowd turned up in the Great Hall to
watch the proceedings (I almost felt like
calling a Union Meeting on the spot).
Prof. Neal, the pro-rector, was in the
chair and, due to his able chairmanship,
the meeting proceeded very smoothly
indeed. There were representatives of
the three main parties. Miss S. Ward,
representing the Labour party in Chel-
sea, Mr. N . Clark, representing the Lib-
eral party in the same constituency, and
Mr. R. Parsons, representing the Con-
servative party in Holborn and St.
Pancras.
The meeting was opened with a brief
introduction to each candidate followed
by a talk from the same. Then questions
were asked, each candidate expressing
surprise at the range of questions asked
and their depth. Unfortunately there
were far more questions written than U
was possible to fit in the time available.
However, again due to the chairmanship,
several topics of interest to Staff and
students alike, were asked.
Following on from that, the elections
have now been held. Several people in
the college have been actively cam-
paigning on behalf of candidates, rang-
ing from Conservative, through Labour
to an I.M.G candidate who (I was asked
not to mention the National F . . . . you
know who).
None of the three candidates, present
alt the meeting were elected. Miss S.
Ward polled 6,839, M r . N . Clark 8,012,
but the Conservative candidate (Sir
Marcus Wortley) polled 23,320. Mr. R.
Parsons polled 8,223 as against the
Labour candidates (Mrs. L . M . Jeger)
12,414.
I would like to take this opportunity
to express my thanks to those who were
present, especially to Prof. Neal.

ROOM BOOKINGS
There has been some
confusion over regulations
regarding the booking of
rooms in the Union. To
clear this the following
points should be noted.
Charges. Outside Bodies
(even if booked through
an I.C. student or Society)
will be charged the nor-
mal rate.
There will be no
charges for private par-
ties (held by I.C. stu-
dents), nor I.C.U. Society
and Club bookings.
Deposits. These must
be given to the Union
Clerk at least one week
in advance. Receipts are
not given, but the book-
er's name will be entered
in a Deposit Book. The
deposit is returnable only
after the Executive con-
sent is given, so there may
be some delay. There will
be no exception to the
cash rule after March 1st
1974, and no booking will
be valid until the cash
deposit (and charge if
necessary) is received. If
not received three days be-
forehand the booking will
be cancelled and security
•instructed not to allow ac-
cess.
All functions, unless
there is a specific notifi
cation from the Executive
must finish by 11.30 p.m.
Clearing up time is allow-
ed after this, but the event
must have finished. In
the event of an extension
being granted the exten-;
sion time is again the time
the event must finish.
The Excutive will not
fail to withhold (it has
already been done) some
or all of the deposits if|
any of the rules regarding!
room bookings are bro-l
ken. A l l applicants must
read the form they sign!
Remember, if the rules
are broken, it could cost
you up to £10!
