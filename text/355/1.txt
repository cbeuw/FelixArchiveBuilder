For three days from Tuesday, March 12th, members
of the college Amnesty International group will be
undertaking a fast as a token gesture of identification
With the millions of prisoners of conscience throughout
the world. These people have committed no offence
but are detained simply for expressing views of which
iheir governments disapproved. They are often tor-
tured and frequently held in cramped cells with far
too HMe food.
Amnesty International was formed 12 yeans ago to
campaign for the release of prisoners of conscience.
The organisation carries out research on prisoners
and provides information for local groups, each of
which adopts a few prisoners and works for Itheir re-
lease.
Wherever possible, groups provide moral and finan-
cial support for prisoners' families; last year £85,000
was spent on welfare work and further considerable
expenditure is necessary to maintain research. It is
important that Amnesty should be completely indepen-
dent of Government assistance in order to maintain
the impartiality upon which its reputation rests. The
organisation thus relies heavily on the general public
for financial support. Local groups need to raise
about £140 a year to finance investigatory work on
behalf of their adopted prisoners.
The college group has responsibility for three pri-
soners: in Turkey, E . Germany and Indonesia, and
we are asking you to support us by sponsoring par-
iiciparits in the three-day fast.
To further the identification we will be fasting out-
side Southside refectory for three days I N A C A G E ,
similar to those used in Vietnam, Brazil, South Africa,
etc. Come and see us; come and sponsor us; come and
fast with us — our prisoners depend on your support.

departments.
For the poll to be valid
25% of the registered stu-
dents at the college must
vote. This means that
1,037 votes must be cast.
If you want to vote then
go along to the nearest
ballot box and do so.
You will need a valid re-
gistration card. Remem-
ber, it is in your own in-
terests to vote, It is
ridiculous to complain of
a non - representative
Union if you don't help
choose the representatives.

PANCAKES
The Union Exec vs ICWA pancake race took place
last Tuesday. Although not timed to begin till 1.00
p.m., several union members w
ere at their vantage
points by 10.00. By the time the race began the Union
Quad was already awash with gallons of water. The
course is simple, consisting of a lap of the quad, Exec
one way, I C W A the other.
By the time it was over, all the participants were
thoroughly soaked, as were several over-exuberant
students.
The afternoon was marred, hovvever, by the antics of
a silly few. Anything that moves in the quad is fair
game, but passers-by at the rear of the Union and in
Prince Consort Road are N O T . These silly people
caused the police to be called in, twice. The latter time
leading to an official complaint.
The complaints did lead to the event pictured below.
