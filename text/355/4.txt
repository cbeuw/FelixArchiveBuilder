SAILING CLUB MEDITATION
A couple of Wednes-
days ago saw the pre-
mature ending of our
'home' sailing season, it
has been confirmed by
the Water Board that it
was not just I.C. boats
which caused the dam
wall to crack — U.C.
helped! Anyway, the
Harp is now half-filled
with mud, much of
which is now decorating
the tops of mainsails of
I.C. boats. Now that sail-
ing is finished and
everybody is feeling de-
pressed and wondering
where all the subs will
go, well they need won-
der no more for the
powers that be have
decided that a new race
box is to be built further
along the Harp.
So what has happened
over the last year? The
team, captained by
Tweedy (Scrap-It) Rog-
ers has beaten just
about everybody in sight
EXCEPT teams from
Cambridge, Birmingham
and Reading (only one
race sailed). This gives
an overall result sheet
of 181 won, 2i lost.
There has been the
usual sprout of disquali-
fications, capsizes and
breakages (Southamp-
ton remarked at the
sheer muscle power of
the I.C. team when see-
ing one member pulling
on the kicking strap to
bend the mast and end
up breaking the boom.
Still, Cambridge were
not to be left out of the
break-down stakes when
two masts disintegrated
and decks pulled off).
Now for the future—
well there are still a few
away matches to come,
i.e. Bath, Bristol, and
then in three weeks'
time is the event of the
year — the Bradford
Barrel. I.C. has won this
competition for the last
two years and we are
confident of the hat-
trick.
Needless to say, both
the I.C. intei collegiate
cup between Mines,
R.C.S. and Guilds (who
usually dominate) and
the U . L equivalent, the
Castaways Cup have had
to be postponed. It is
hoped these trophies
will eventually be sailed
for early next year.
T h e W e d nesday
League — again for the
nth year running I.C. 1st
team won the 1 St league.
I.C. seconds came run-
ners up in the second
league after losing to a
Bart's team in the last
race.
And now for some-
thing entirely different—
the SOCIAL EVENT OF
THE YEAR. The I.C. S.C.
Annual Dinner—guest
speaker Olympic silver
medallist David Hunt
(also of Needlespur
fame). The price is £2
and tickets can be ob-
tained from any commit-
tee member or Tizard
555. This is expected to
be a really good do with
p l e n t y o f b o o z e ,
(females)?, chat, argu-
ment and food.
AT ARE T
STERS ABOUT
Trying to sell ceilidh
tickets to people, we
have often been asked:
"What is a ceilidh?", so,
as we can't expect you
to come to something
that 'could be anything
from a talk on the habits
of ancient Egyptians to
an exhibition of Irish
walking sticks (think
about it), I am here to
tell you about our
ceilidh.
Firstly, a ceilidh is a
Folk Dance. Folk danc-
ing is the English ver-
sion of the Scots Eight-
some Reels and Irish
Jigs. We here apologise
to any Celts who have
taken offence at this
comparison. Don't be
put off by dances with
names such as "Gather-
ing Peascods" (or some-
thing like that), 'cos it
has—as far as I can see
—nothing whatsoever to
do with gathering peas-
cods or anything else for
that matter. Neither do
you have to worry about
not knowing What to do
— w h e n dancing of
bourse, silly—because
there's a "caller" on
stage, that is a man who
calls out which steps to
dance at the appropriate
time. The steps them-
selves are not difficult,
and ithey fit easily into
the music, so there is
no need to worry about
not being able to dance.
And as for looking a bit
stupid, everyone else
there too looks just the
same, so no one notices,
they just enjoy them-
selves.
Now, about the Yet-
ties. They are not, con-
trary to common opinion,
teddy bears off Doctor
Who. They are a folk
group — surprise, sur-
prise — and they play
traditional country dance
music. They are very
well known—shame on
those of you who haven't
heard of them, you don't
read our posters! — and
are good. They are com-
petent musicians, who
understand their music,
which as you probably
know, is important. But
you don't have to believe
me, borne to the ceilidh
and see for yourself. The
Yetties come from Dor-
set, so if you come from
the West Country, come
and support your com-
patriots — we're a min-
ority. The Yetties have
played at many famous
folk music events in-
cluding Folk at Eton, and
the International Folklore
Festival at Sidmouth;
now they're here on
your doorstep, in the
J.C.R. to be precise.
They are recommended
for ceilidhs, that's why
we booked them for
ours.
Those of you who
went to the I.C.W.A.
ceilidh last term will
know all this, so if
you've read this • far,
please come to our
ceilidh, it should be as
good, 'cos we helped
organise that one. If
you've never been to a
ceilidh before, come to
this one, it's a fun way
to spend (the last Wed-
nesday of term — who
wants to work then any-
way? Or any other for
that matter! The ceilidh
is open to anyone who
cares to come, so feel
welcome.
At the college there are a wide
variety of extra-curricular activities
available which supposedly enrich
our lives beyond the limitations of
lecture room and Chemistry lab. One
of these "fringe" activities Which
seems to have found its niche in the
college over the past couple of years
alongside Caving Club and Wellsoc
is Transcendental Meditation. Some-
thing for the reclusive few you might
think but a recent snippet of inform-
ation which dropped my way via a
somewhat dubious handout, made
your intrepid Felix reporter decide to
take-goat-skin and map of the Him-
alayas in hand and find out a little
more. The snippet of information?—
a survey of students' exam perform-
ance found that those who took up
Transcendental Meditation showed a
significant increase in their marks
which continued to grow as they con-
tinued to meditate.
Eventually, said Felix reporter
tracked down former I.C. student
Stephen Giles, who after graduating
spent some time with Maharishi
Mohesh Yogi—who started the whole
thing off, and is now a teacher of the
meditation. I posed him a question or
two :
Q Most students have very little
time: what is involved in Transcend-
ental Meditation?
A About 15 minutes morning and
evening once you've actually-learnt.
Q And how long does that take?
A Four sessions of about two hours.
Q Well how can the two daily ses-
sions affect exam performance, do
they help you concentrate better?
A They do actually, although one
doesn't practice concentration during
the meditation, quite the opposite in
fact. The main effect though is to
make your thinking much clearer so
that you absorb and use information
more easily, more effectively. You
don't actually gain any new informal
tion when you learn to meditate, just
a simple technique Which when prac-
tised regularly enables you to assimil-
ate information better. There is a
surfeit of information in the college,
a large number of minds. What is
needed is a means of expanding the
conscious capacity of the minds so
that they can absorb more of the in-
formation in a meaningful way —
that's T M .
Q What degree did you get?
A A third (laughter). I was very in-
volved with Union activities when I
was here so didn't do much work,
but what I found was that after start-
ing to meditate I remembered much
more from the lectures, it wasn't so
necessary to cram. Taking finals
wasn't really too much of a strain.
Q Students' personal problems
tend to affect their work situation?
A Right. On this level alone T M
can make a big difference. Practising
T M produces a more balanced person-
ality. Introverts get on better with
other people.
Q How does meditation do that?
A It very much reduces the level of
stress and tension in the nervous sys-
tem. Consequently one is less wor-
ried, feels happier and things just go
more easily. You sometimes experi-
ence this when you're not practising
meditation if you're well rested and
feeling fresh, everything goes much
more easily, little upsets don't put
you off. During the meditation you
get a deeper rest than the deepest
sleep which revitalises the system, as
a result you are more alert and stay
alert longer.
Q Doesn't this, alertness, more
powerful thinking, etc., tend to put
other people off you?
A No, the opposite. Everyone
enjoys being with happy, successful
people. Meditating certainly helps
one to get on with members of the
opposite sex (laughter). The develop-
ment is very natural and makes one
more sensitive to other people. It
doesn^t just enlarge all aspects of a
person's personality irrespective of
their influence on other people.
Q What does the college society
do—are there students who teach the
meditation?
A No. You have to learn from a
teacher trained by Maharishi, but the
college society tries to make informa-
tion about the meditation available,
facilitate people learning it and make
sure those practising it are getting
maximum benefit.
BOOKWEEK
You may have been
present at the ''Great De-
bate" held a couple of
weeks ago or you may
not, but almost certainly
you saw some bumph for
it either on a poster or on
the pages of Felix, C E F E
or Good News. Entitled
"This House Believes
Christianity is False Con-
sciousness", didn't you
pause to wonder how to
define consciousness? I
know a great deal of the
debate spotlighted this
issue, of course I can't say
whether the conclusions
on the meaning of the
word were correct or not,
it's suitably vague to defy
precise definition.
But how many people
paused to consider the
word Christianity, what
does it mean? Surely this
is a far more vital word.
Does it describe . . . well
what? A moral code? A
religion? A way of life? I
think that the term has
been devalued over recent
years. Admittedly it can't
be defined in a single
phrase, but it's not "what
you want it to mean."
During the week of
March 11-17 Christians
at this college are provid-
ing you with the oppor-
tunity to find out more
about Christianity in a
"bookweek".
One of the books con-
cerned in this venture is
called "Basic Christianity"
by J. Stoot and gives, as
its title implies, an outline
of what Christianity is and
what Christians stand for.
There will be a book-
stall stationed around col-
lege and lots of people
willing to talk to you and
answer your questions on
any aspects of the subject,
from their personal experi-
ence and they'll also be
able to furnish you with
books Which will be able
to answer your questions
in depth.
