SAILING
Sailing at the Welsh
Harp has had to end for
the year as the Water
Board have drained the
reservoir for repairs. How-
ever, Wednesday, January
30th saw most of ithe Lon-
don Colleges braving the
new hazard of mud for the
final rounds of the inter-
collegiate leagues. In the
first league the winners
were to be decided by a
meeting between unbeaten
I.C. first team and Queen
Mary College and in the
second between I.C. second
and St. Bartholomew's
Hospital. I.C. first team
were lucky lin the first race
to get a re-sail, due 'to in-
correct starting by both
teams, after Steve Mc-
Queen and Peter Barrett
capsized. However, in the
next two races I.C. won in
Style 1, 2 and 1, 3 respec-
tively, thus winning the
league.
The I.C. second team
also ran into trouble in the
firSt race. Simon Briscoe
and Richard Wood found
it impossible to get off the
shrove in time to start due
to mud and though Rich-
ard Woods and Tony
Bambridge sailed well to
finish first they were Hater
disqualified for failing to
start corredtly. In ithe sec-
ond race I.C. finished 1st
and 3rd by dirty sailing,
but lit was not good
enough to make up the
points deficit and so I.C.
second team finished run-
ners up.
At the weekend the 3-
boat team travelled down
to the Hamble ito sail
Southampton University.
Unfortunately they sailed
with a very weak team
which presented no serious
challenge ito the more
superior I.C. team. The
first race was sailed in ithe
more Sheltered river. A l -
though Simon Briscoe
sailed well at first he went
for the wrong leeward
mark with a Southampton
boat and finished fifth. The
other two I.C. boats
(Brian Rogers and Nigel
Charlwood) finished first
and second. After a visit
to the local pub (your
round, Malcolm) before
two more races in South-
ampton Water, Tony
Bambridge sailed easily
into the lead (a Hamble
freeze?) with Richard
Woods second and Brian
Rogers third. In ithe final
race Nigel Charlwood
decided to sail back to the
Club-house due to sea-
sickness (?) leaving the
other two IC boats batt-
ling for first and second
places.

I.C. won their third
consecutive Gutteridge
Cup Final on February
23rd in an indecisive man-
ner.
From the kick-off I.C.
were in trouble due to
their own mistakes (par-
ticularly the forwards).
R F H were given several
chances to take the lead
from penalty kicks, but
managed to fluff them all
with the greatest of ease.
After several narrow es-
capes (during which Flan-
egan claims to have dislo-
cated his shoulder) I.C.
got steadily back into the
game, and near half-time
took the lead when Mar-
tin Cotter made a break
and fed the ball to Ger-
wyn Clement, who then
beat the full-back with
the slowest sidestep ever
seen, to score near the
corner. Needless to say
Ray Hughes missed the
conversion.
The second half follow-
ed the first half's pattern
of indecisive play. I.C.
were in trouble several
times, but R F H couldn't
make any headway (they
missed three kicks in
front of the posts) which
was particularly due to
Pete Tulrugges excellent
display at full back. I.C.
managed to seal the game
up, ten minutes from
lime, when Ray Hughes
kicked ahead, the full
back got nowhere near it,
and Bob Stern collected,
beat the full back and
passed it to Gerwyn Cle-
ment {who happened to
be strolling along outside
him) to score his second
try (Guess who wrote
this). I.C. then managed
to hold on, with the for-
wards now playing much
better and the backs tack-
ling well.
After the match we had
our usual celebrations,
and we all got extremely
pissed. Also four of the
players and supporters
went on "Strike" (subtle),
and the police are also
looking for a 5 ft. 11 in.

ROWING
Saturday, 16th February
saw the boat club's first
competitive venture of
this year. The occasion
was the old Southern Uni-
versities Championships,
renamed this year the
Southern Universities Re-
gatta. It has been held
since 1967 and all three
divisions have thus far
eluded the grasp of I.C.
No Novice VIII was sent
this year, but the 1st and
2nd VIIIs travelled to
Reading to compete in
their respective divisions.
The 1st VIII had rather
an odd look about it as
it has been rather injury
prone so far this year.
X - COUNTRY
Concerning Elephants
There are no elephants
or hippopotami roaming
wild in Surrey, though
there is certainily no lack
of mud in which Ithey
might wallow as was
found by runners in the
fourth league race at
Guildford. I.C., with our
18 runners, comprised no
less than one-filth of the
field, drawn from twenty
other colleges, which set
off round 5J miles of
knee-deep ploughed mud.
This large turnout, togeth-
er With Rob Allinson's
position of 8th, despite
having a spiked foot, Steve
(of whom more later)
Webb's making Ithe first
team and the timely re-
turn to form of Ian Ellis
led to the result that the
first team is now third in
division one (but only
seven points ahead), and
even the fourth team put
in another appearance (at
last) so that we are now
4th, l l t h and 18ith in the
second division with one
race to go.
5 for the 5
The following Saturday,
in a hastily arranged fix-
ture, the "Hiillingdon 5",
only five Of our more Stal-
wart backmarkers took
part, with Steve (again)
Webb doing within experi-
mental error of 30min,
Dave Jones 30m 48, Keith
Ahlers not far behind him,
Mike Welford looking ex-
tremely distressed after 'his
sprint start in 32min and
Pete Johnson completing
our performance in 35min.
Hyde Park Relay
Title: "How Birming-
ham led 86 other teams all
the way setting a new
record of 84m 07s, fol-
lowed by Cambridge Uni-
versity in 84m 30s and not
so closely by Loughbor-
ough Colleges in 85m 32s,
how Jim Brown set a new
course record of 13m 21s
taking Borough Road
from eighth to fifth on the
last lap and winning for
them the Imperial College
Unlion Cup, and how I.C.
came 56th (despite Strained
ligaments, 'n' bouts of flu
and sickly parents) to
achieve which Ian Ellis,
Paul Clark, Dave's Payne
and Houlbrooke, Phil
Meyler and A l f Gamett
did times of 15m 53, 15m
55, 16m 40, 17m 10, 16m
34 and 16m 33 respective-
ly. Also some remarks on
how Sir Brian and Lady
Flowers kindly came along
and presented the trophies
and how Steve (yet again)
Webb was unexpectedly
called forth to present Ithe
Steve Webb Trophy to
Cambridge. With a short
record of how Rob spent
2hrs looking for his coat
and concluding with a note
about the manner of our
defeat later that evening at
another relay at the hands
of Alsager who started
with half-empty glasses
and how next morning I.C.
became the alternative
attraction to the Changing
of the Guard (which
wasn't on), how Trafalgar
Square was visited and
how Pad felt himself in-
wardly threatened during
a sprint down Pall Mall".
That's it, except to
thank everybodys' friends
for their help, Kaliray,
Neil, Keith and Doug for
their part in the affair (and
Rich Harrington, Ashely
Cooper, Geoff Spurr, Rob
Maddison and Ian "have
gun will travel" Isher-
wood). Also thanks ito the
refectory Staff for feeding
600 people in Jhr, and
some Dramsoc people (cf.
last year).
D.A.J.
Perhaps it would be more
accurate to say that the
elite I V from the VIII
has been prone to injury.
Neither Graham Lloyd
(car crash and broken
wrist) nor Dai Bevan
(strained back) were able
to row, whilst Bill Swift
(Pitoraeasis Rosea?) and
John Bland (flu plus ab-
scess) just managed to get
fit in time to occupy the
stroke and four seats re-
spectively. The absence of
the first two meant that
Joe Shrypriuk T.C's. ans-
wer to Dave Sawyer) had
to change sides, which left
room for a guest appear-
ance from Dick Smith
(direct from Mount Ken-
ya accompanied by Amoe-
bic Dysentry) who last
made an appearance in
the U . L . Alum Cup where
he won the Novice sculls.
The first race against
Southampton University
was a typical I.C. opening
row, with half the crew
thinking it was easy while
the other half were killing
themselves and wondering
why they weren't going
away. The result being an
unconvincing win by 2L.
The Semi-Final was
against Reading Univer-
sity and I.C. drew the
unfavoured Oxon station.
Due to a bend in the
course, the start was stag-
gered and this station had
3/4L disadvantage on the
start. Off the start Read-
ing pulled out another
1/4 length and went al-
most clear. However the
scratch I.C. boat sudden-
ly clicked and with their
severely geared boat they
powered their way through
Reading, rating about
34. By half way I.C. had
a 1/4L lead and as they
crossed, the finishing line
the lead was over a length.
This race was good by any
standards, but unfortu-
nately it took a lot out of
the crew as they were very
tired (to put it politely),
and it was with some
trepidation that I.C.
awaited the final against
Oriel (Oxford).
Now Oriel was a load
of cocky . . . , especially
as they had won the event
last year. Having had a
row over in their heat,
they had reached the start
of their semi-final only to
find that their opposition
had broken their rudder.
On returning to the land-
ing stage and seeing I.C.
flaked out after their race
against Reading, they de-
cided that since they were
obviously going to win
anyway, there might as
well be a three way final
instead of them having to
row in a semi final. After
putting this proposition to
the I.C. coach, they
promptly got back in their
boat and rowed off to the
start of their semi final.
In this race they lost some
of their confidence as they
were pushed pretty hard
by Pembroke. The final
was rowed in poor light
as it was now about 5.30.
The race had two distinct
phases. The first lasted
about ten strokes in which
time Oriel took about
3/4L. The second lasted
for the rest of the race,
and saw I.C. row through
Oriel to win by a good
2 i L . Thus the first Regat-
ta of 1974 brought success
to the 1st VIII.
The 2nd VIII also man-
aged to reach the final of
their event and did well
to get within 3/4L of
Reading II. With a little
more preparation this
VIII could do well.
The weekend's racing
was not perhaps the best
preparation for the fol-
lowing Wednesday which
saw the second event of
the year take place. This
race, the University of
London Head of the Riv-
er Race, is a processional
race in which the crews
set off at 10 second inter-
vals and are timed over a
course of some 4 i miles, is
a vastly different sort of
race to the one of the pre-
vious weekend. I.C. have
only lost the open division
twice since 1962 and de-
spite a bad row managed
to win it again. Unfortu-
nately, unlike last year,
they didn't manage to
beat Tyrian ( U L II), who
race but are not eligible
for the trophy, not being
a college crew. The 2nd
VIII came sixth overall,
and the first Novice VIII
managed to come second
in their division.
