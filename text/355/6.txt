MAGGIE BALL
Queen of the
Maggie Bell went solo (after the split
of Stone the Crows) eighteen months
ago. Since then she has regularly topped
the polls in the music papers, despite
spending most of the time without mak-
ing any appearances on record, stage
or in print.
She has not, however, been resting
since then. She has in fact made three
albums. The first two were scrapped in
her search for a successful debut album.
Satisfied, she had now released that al-
bum, ' Q U E E N O F T H E NIGHT.' and
the search was worth it.
In this album she displays her singing
talents to the fullest, with a wide range
of varied tracks, chosen after a weekend
spent listening to over 250 songs.
To do full justice to all the tracks
would take far more space than is avail-
able. However, to pick out a "best"
track would be almost impossible.
" A Woman Left Lonely" (side one,
track two) is a soulful number, fairly
typical of a lot of the album. "Souven-
irs" (John Prine's number) has a lot
more power in it, not just from Mag-
gie's vocals but also from the brass and
keyboards in the backing.
"Oh M y M y " (Ringo Starkey) is the
opening cut on side two and the one
chosen for release as a single. A good
choice (if she feels that it is necessary
to release one) though not one in which
her full talents are used. "As The Years
Go Passing By," the backing to the
single, is much more indicative of her
capabilities. Hopefully this will be given
as much air play as the ' A ' side.
Overall, the album is well balanced,
and could, when it has been fully lis-
tened to. become a classic.
An album I would definitely recom-
mend and congratulations to Scotland
on producing such talent. (PS Hope they
win the Cup also).

S L A D E . Is there really any point in
saying much more about their latest
offering " O L D N E W B O R R O W E D
A N D B L U E , " The chances of anyone
reading this who have not at some time
heard them is very slim indeed.
1 have had little contact with pre-
vious Slade albums but what little 1 have
had has convinced me that if I wanted a
Slade album for my collection it would
not matter which I had, They're all
more or less alike; both to each other
and from track to track.
On the latest album there is only two
cuts, 'Everyday' and 'Find Yourself A
Rainbow' that stand out as being differ-
ent.
'Everyday' is a much slower, more
subtle number than the remainder. Not
a fast rocking number, more of one that
should be listened too, not heard.
'Find Yourself A Rainbow' is^ a hon-
ky-tonk number with accompanying
piano.
The remainder are typical Slade num-
bers, loud, rocky, and (such as 'My
Friend Stan") fairly well known. Noddy
Holder's vocals scream out just as usual,
although Jimmy Lea is given a chance
on two1
of the tracks.
Slade are really a live band. They
generate excitement and develop it to a
high level, but to do that they need to
be playing on stage to an audience. Here
they come into their own. On record,
however, they lose out. This record
could not be described as bad. But, you
either like Slade. or you don't; take your
choice.

CONCERTS
MAN
Man first appeared at 1C in January,
'72 supporting Stone the Crows—a gig
for which they were paid, I believe, £40.
The Felix review the following week
said "I should like everybody to know
about a group called Man . . . they must
have been delighted with their reception
in the Great Hall . . . the subtle use of
dynamics prompts me to stick my neck
out and say that in a years time they
will be as big as Yes."
I should know — I was the reviewer.
It's now two years later and in terms of
bigness my prophecy hasn't material-
ised. However I've wanted to put the
band on again for a long time and last
weekend, when they cost me rather
more than forty quid, I was not dis-
appointed. Musically Man are now all
that Yes were for me in those far-off
days and 1 hold the opinion (one that I
don't expect everyone to share) that they
are Britain's best active band.
To classify Man's music it is inevit-
able that I should make comparisons.
Unfortunately the groups I allude to will
probably only be familiar to those who
are Man fans anyway, but here goes—
Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd, Quicksilver
Messenger Service, the Allman Brothers
Band. But Man don't copy them—can
you follow that?
Man are at present Micky Jones (gui-
tar) and Terry Williams (drums) who
have remained with the group through-
out its many personnel changes, Ken
Whaley (bass) and Malcolm Morley
(electric piano) both ex-Help Yourself,
and Deke Leonard (guitar) who was
with the group, along with Micky, Terry
and bassist Martin Ace, that played
here before, and left shortly afterwards,
and has only just rejoined. Although
Micky Jones's guitar has been Man's
hallmark during the last two years
and he plays real good, Deke just cuts
him blind — he has a fluidity, a devast-
ating range of sounds, and can play at
blistering speed when he wants to.
There's no reason why the current line-
up should stay together forever but with
these two guitarists in the band—give
them eighteen months and, I say again.
Man will be as big, not just as good, as
Yes.
They opened the show with "Ameri-
can Mother," a Malcolm Morley toon,
I think, as he sang it. I haven't heard it
before, and I don't yet have strong opi-
nions on the number. The vocals were
delivered in a manner reminiscent of
Lou Reed's, and this similarity was
echoed by Morley's appearance. This
was followed by "7171551" from Deke's
album "Iceberg," which was rather repi-
titious in places. Morley's 'Blown Away'
which appeared on a Help Yourself al-
bum, was less intense than most of the
music, and the group sounded quite dif-
ferent when playing in a laid-back
style. At about this point the audience
really came alive and "C'mon" was re-
ceived with rapturous applause. It be-
gan with a section very similar to the
Floyd's "Echoes" or "Saucerful of Se-
crets" and went on for nearly half-an-
hour.
Some people I spoke to afterwards
made the criticism that some of the
numbers went on too long.
Two of Deke's shorter numbers fol-
lowed. "Hard Way to Live" and "Re-
main" which I don't think the band
have played since he left before. It is, I
believe, the story of how he was beaten
up by a Belgian customs man.
"This is a rave from the grave" an-
nounced Micky, and it was "Bananas,"
mostly taken at a furious pace, but
again over 20 minutes long. The length
of tracks did not, I should add, seem to
worry most of the audience. After
"Bananas" they left the stage. Would
they leave without "Spunk Rock"? No
way. Back they came for another go at
the definitive rock jam. Unequalled, in
my opinion, for sheer coherence and
excitement, by any group on either side
of the Atlantic. Listen to the version on
the long-deleted "Greasy Truckers Par-
ty" L P or, failing that, on Man's "Back
Into the Future" and you know what I
mean.
After "Spunk Rock" they finished.
Man had played for over two hours.

What in your opinion is the greatest
single event in the history of mankind?
I think you'll find it difficult to call to
mind any occasion worthy of such an
elevated position.
This book however accesses an occur-
ance which is surely worth considering
for this role. Is it possible for a person
to die, be buried, and yet be seen alive
by several hundred people a few days
later.
Michael Green looks objectively at
facts centred around an event that hap-
pened about 2000 years ago when Jesus
Christ performed the feat just men-
tioned. The book shows the relevance,
the challenge, and the power of the res-
urrection to change men's lives. It also
describes the way in which we today
can experience this power, and indeed
also become alive, in a life which has
meaning and purpose.
Lennon-McCartney wrote of
'All the lonely people
where do they all belong?'
and 'Nowhere Man'
'Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like me and you?'
Is he like you? Read this book and
find a meaning to life.
