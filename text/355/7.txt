GOLFING
Prior to February 20th there had been much specu-
fttion by both golfing pundits and members of the
jociety alike as to who really was the star of the soci-
ety. Although early in the season Bill Galderwood had
had this title blazened on his golf bag and everyone
had assumed that this was the case, recent events had
Jed to the growing belief that 'there had come one
even greater than he'. Who this was no-one knew but
many felt that perhaps unbeaten Chris Cobbledick
fitted the bill. However the society Captain had made
it known (often!) that, in his opinion, his own un-
beaten run in the team entitled him to be thought of
in the same breath as these two (unfortunately no-one
else agreed). John Mendonca, a recent addition to the
team ranks, had won all bis matches in such style
that some felt his unbeaten run was the significant
one and that the championship would show him up as
'Golfer of the Society'. The society hon. sec, Jules
Dan, expressed the belief that the only true stamp oi
star golfing talent was to have an unbeaten record in
the first team; thus Bill was 'really only a second rate
hacker with an impressive sticker on his bag'.
However, no matter who it is that one considers
as the greatest star one thing is certain; the society
at IC is undoubtedly the most talented and successful
in London today. For proof of this we have only to
look at the number of team members Who have played
for London University this season. These are Bill
Calderwood, Nigel Foster, Rich Brown, Mike Strick-
land and at the time of writing John Mendonca has
just been called up for his first cap. Considering our
Society is only permitted to be 25 strong this is a re-
markable tribute to the wealth of talent at IC.
Indeed when one puts by all this the fact that John
Medonca is also a Portugese Youth International the
thought must occur that there may be many stars
with us at present.
If the array of talent for the Championships was
mind-boggling the scores were not. In almost perfect
conditions the morning's play proved to be an almost
unqualified disaster, the qualification being Andy
Knox who cruised in with a nett 72. This placed him
in a Clear lead by five shots over Bill Calderwood at
lunch which he celebrated with a couple of rustic
pints of ale. Everyone enjoyed Andy celebrating in this
manner, possibly because it removed the fear in every-
one's mind that he might run away with the 'Tourney'
in the afternoon. In the afternoon playing conditions
grew somewhat worse and paradoxically the scores
improved a little. Andy Knox let his grip on the
tournament slip and Bill Calderwood stepped bravely
into the breach to take the coveted President's Trophy
for the best days medal score. Runner-up to him was
our old onion-eater Clive Pembetton who played a
solid if uninspired day's golf. Rick Brown won the
Glover cup for the best gross of the day although he
hit many more than a gross of shots. Runner-up was
our international star John Medonca. The Lawson
cup competition for the best stableford round in the
afternoon was taken by Jules Dan, an uncannily suc-
cessful competitor in his own competitions.
Although we seem to cut his handicap prior to
every club competition he still seems to produce the
best nett nonetheless. Runner-up to Jules was Mike
Marx who played well enough to win most stableford
competitions if it were not for the aforementioned
being in the field.
In conclusion I would say that the competition was
an occasion enjoyed by everyone, particularly our
new Society Champion Bill Calderwood.

L O N D O N H O S P I T A L S
Semi-final of the Univer-
sity of London Knock-out
Cup.
0-1 (Penalty)
I.C. were knocked out
of the Cup competition in
a hard, well-contested
match. Although individu-
al players on the I.C. side
displayed a good work
rate, the team in general
could not link-up to show
the form which had earli-
er disposed of Barts. The
Hospitals side seemed the
more alert of the teams
and were slightly quicker
to the "loose balls". How-
ever, I.C. were well able
to cope with the pressure
in defence but were un-
able to penetrate on a
regular basis into the
Hospital's ' D \ The decid-
ing goal came from a pen-
alty flick given, as we ad-
mit, quite fairly, for stick
obstruction in the ' D ' .
The last efforts of I.C.
could not prevail in spite
of a tactical substitution
in the 2nd half intended to
create more drive in the
centre.

on, Hatcher, Whittington,

Sat., 23rd Feb.
I.C. 1st X I v A S H F O R D
4-4
This was meant to be a
"friendly" match against
a 1st division side, I.C.
still unjustly lingering in
the 3rd division, hut due
to very poor umpiring
the match degenerated in-
to a well-disguised brawl
20 mins. from the end.
I.C. had until this period
held the lead but Ashford
fought back using the
occasional technical in-
fringement which was un-
penalised. Tempers be-
came a little frought and
fouling commenced on a
widespread and very
skilled basis. A l l fouls
were unseen and it was
noted well executed. Ash-
ford did assume the lead
late in the match, but a
well converted penalty by
Harrison gave the final
score. (Mr. Kullar had not
recently shown brilliant
form in the art of penalty
flicks.) The general im-
pression was one of a
match which started out
to be a little physical, but
later degenerated to a
game in which skill was
sacrificed.
Team: Bateman, Cam-
eron, Vieyra, Downs
(capt.), Hanson, Evans,
Ross, Kullar, Puri, Harri-
son, Tyler.
Goals: Evans (the half-
back), Puri (2), Harrison.

I.C. 1st X I v.
S I L V E R W I N G ( B E A )
1-2
Yet another hard match
marred by poor umpiring.
The game quicldy became
physically-orientated and
I.C. ceased to play with
any skill. A good goal by
Nicols gave I.C. the lead
but this was unfortunately
lost. The match which
was poor was succeeded
by an excellent bar night
spent reminiscing about
Swedish porn pens and
the hard lot of the airline
staff. Ross seemed to be
over-infatuated with a
topic of conversation—
tennis, or something. A t
least his tongue didn't
quite scrape the floor.

on, Hatcher, E v a n s ,

ols, Tyler.

2nd X I
Last Saturday the all
star X I played away at
Ashford, Middlesex. Des-
pite some rather confus-
ing "Popplogical" travel-
ling instructions we all
arrived in time for a 3
o'clock bully off.
The pace of the game
was typical of most 2nd
X I matches — fast and
furious. The enthusiasm
is admirable but I feel a
little more level-headed-
ness and ball control
would pay better divi-
dends. The forwards were
kept busy all through the
match and Dave Crook
came close to scoring on
numerous occasions. The
defence showed more co-
ordination than.has been
evident in the past al-
though the half backs
could have given the for-
wards more support when
on the attack. A special
word of thanks to Gra-
ham Popple for sparing
some of his invaluable
time. He will be well re-
ceived in the team next
week with or without
spouse in attendance.

SHOOTING
On Sunday, February
24th the annual full-bore
rifle match between R C S
and Guilds was held at
Bisley under almost ideal
weather conditions.
Bisley Camp, Brook-
wood, Surrey, is the
world's centre for full-
bore shooting. The dis-
tances over which one can
shoot vary from 100 to
1200 yds. Due to altera-
tions at present being
made on the medium
length ranges the compe-
tition was, for the first
time, held at 900 and
1000 yds.
As is customary, Guilds
were barely up to strength
while R C S had a large
and talented pool on
Which to draw. After
leaving the Sports Centre
at the ungodly hour of
9.20 a.m. the teams
reached Bisley, despite
unintentional detours,

early enough for the mor-
ning's shoot, over 90§
yds., to be finished by a
1.00 p.m. deadline.
During a mainly liquid
lunch at the North Lon-
don Rifle Club scores
were compared and R C S
were found to have al-
ready accumulated a 12
point lead.
In the afternoon, fol-
lowing some 'slight' de-
lay in changing target
markers, all shooting was
completed well before the
light started to fail but
not before representa-
tives from both sides had
shown their lack of ex-
perience by failing several
times to hit the target,
with the result that R C S
romped home to a well
deserved victory.
The scores (best 4 from
each team to count,
marked out of 50) were
as follows:
900 yds 1000 yds Total
41 45 86
43 39 82

Team total 341

38 39 77

38 43 81
Team total 309
Steve Dawson, Mike Hall and Tony Porter were
also involved.

WINKS
This report has been specially written on the in-
structions of Tony Bush, who wants to see his name in
print.
IC Winks Club entertained a team from Bancroft
School, Essex, and we soon showed them what winks is
all about. We started the games on the floor, which
put us off, as the winks were bouncing too high. After
the first round, tables were available and so once again
we would reach the heights of brilliance and destroy
all those in our way. Tony Bush made some good
moves but his vision was somewhat impaired by gin
and tonic and a few squops went astray. Potting out
was the order of the day againslt vastly inferior opposi-
tion and the result was a grand victory.
Earlier we had played Southampton in the Prince
Phillip Wink competition and for once produced a
full team. We fought bravely against the Leeds I hi ted
of winks, but we are no Bristol City and it was to no
avail. Tony Bush did not play. Our agony in defeat was
slightly alleviated by a win in the last round. Helen,
having gone off to bash up a minesman, left her part-
ner to fend for himself. He borrowed a player front
somewhere and they won their game. Maybe we should
have got rid of her before the first game . . .
Winks desperately needs someone to take over next
year. Are you man enough to take on the enormou*
responsibiliiity? I did and look what happened to me.
