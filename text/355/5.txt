Last year I.C. Eco-Action Group collected com-
puter paper for re-cycling and now the college, per-
suaded of the economic viability of the scheme, have
officially taken over its collection. Eco-Action have
moved on to collecting waste paper of all kinds, and
cardboard. The project has been launched in the
Physics Department and hopefully will spread to the
rest of the college. Please keep your waste paper and
either take it to one of the collection boxes in Physics
or dump it with Brian Dodd (Falmouth 354) or Averil
Dewing (Selkirk 562).
Brian Dodd and Averil Dewing.
