GROSS CLUB'S
FINE ACHIEVEMENT
Land's End to John O' Groats Relay i n 99 hours 14 minutes
This relay follows any route between
Lands End and John (VGFroats that does
not involve the use of a ferry. The 1.0.
attempt was organised in much the same
way as the one last year by the Univer-
sity Cross Country Club which was un-
successful. The eight runners were div-
ided into four teams of two, each team
being in a seperate vehicle. Every team
had to run twenty miles in stage
lengths chosen to suit the individuals con-
cerned, then eat, drive on sixty miles to
their next take-over point, and sleep
there for the rest of the eight-hour cycle
until it was time to run again. In-
itially the intention was to keep to a tea
m.p.h. schedule, which would have
allowed us to just break the record of
87 hr. 26 m. held by Cambridge Univer-
sity.
The vehicles left Garden Hall in the
early afternoon of Tuesday April 4th for
Bodmin, where camp was made for the
night in torrential rain. On the way there
Keith Wall's Dormobile had an argument
with a bank of earth near Bodmin, losing
its nearside door in the process.
The vehicles moved up to their respect-
ive first take-over points next morning,
and John Cleator started to run from
Land's End Hotel at 11.00 a.m. The
weather became fine for the start and re-
mained so for some time. With a helpful
following wind we kept well ahead of
schedule across the hills of Cornwall and
Devon, but, at midnight, Ted Wilkins
and George Turner got lost in the minor
roads between Credition and Tiverton,
resulting in a loss of thirty minutes.
As Bristol was approached, on Thurs-
day morning, Chris James developed
sickness and a bad leg, so Dave Colvin,
one of the two reserves allowed, relieved
-him. While he was being brought up to
do this John Collins had to run a ten-
and-a-half mile leg, and James had to
stagger along1
for five miles. Continued
rain which lasted for sixteen hours, had
set in at this stage.
With 240 miles done, Jbeypnd Glou-
cester, other injuries became apparent.
Both Cleator and Jeff Greenleaf had
strained knees, and they had to be as-
sisted by Dick Burt, who volunteered to
act as reserve at the last moment in place
of Alan Hookert who had hurt his foot in
an accident while travelling down to
LandB End. Ted Willkins and Pete
Warron were having foot trouble, but
George Turner, Dave Hammond and John
Collins were running well and continued
to do so.
At Warrington Dave Gilbert joined us to
act as a driver. There we were treated,
to the sight of him standing in the road
(holding the door of a Dormobile being
driven away by Jim Bernard I String was
used to tie it on again.
IIHHHI
COLLINS AT THE FINISH
.On Friday morning Collins and Colvin
ran up Shaj> Etelt (IfiQO ft».)) and the
Scotish Border was reached that after-
noon, four hours behind schedule. A new
casualty was Roger Etedge, one ^f the
drivers, who had to pay a short visit to
hospital, suffering from extreme exhaust-
ion. We had then done 560 miles, and
were well over half way, and the weather
was much improved.
Th© hilly countryside was tackled relat-
ively easily, Collins ancf Colvin having
the worst climb — Beattock. Unfortunat-
ely, very early on Saturday morning, in
freezing conditions, James and Wilkins
got badly lost in a new road system near
Lanark, resulting in a loss of two-and-
a-half hours, and putting us 7^ hours be-
hind schedule.
On Saturday rnorning Hammonds, Burt
and Greenleaf very successfully tackled
an extremely hilly 40 mile detour in the
Loch Tay area, which saved 11 miles,
but involved one climb to 1,700 ft., and
several others to 1,100 ft. from 500 ft.
After this Collins and Colvin climbed"
the 1,500 ft. Drumochter Pass, and we
had then gone further than U.L.C.C.C.
did last year.
The last mountainous 299 miles were
completed on Saturday afternoon and
night, and Sunday morning in bitteriv
cold weather with pouring rain and gale
force winds. In spite of this all nine run-
ners did well, and when the stage lengths
were reduced for an 80 mile long "sprint"
to finish, the scheduled speed was again
maintained. Collins, after running 110
miles, did one of. his last miles in five
nrnutes, and he frequently^ exceeded 15
m.p.h. downhill. We re'ached John
O'Groats Hotel at 2.14 p.m. on Sunday,
99 hr. 14m. after starting, an<l everyone
was still running strongly.
Much credit for this achievement is due
to the crew,of the fifth vehicle who cooked
a meal for five people, in all conditions,
every twenty miles, and who had pratic-
ally no rest.
Teams, with distances run, were:
A. John Cleator (68) and Jeff Greenleaf
(100)
Dave Fearn and Jim Bernard: hired
Bedford Dormobile.
B. John Collins (116) and Chris James
(56)
