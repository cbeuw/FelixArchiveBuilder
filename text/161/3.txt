Dramatic Society Conquers
This production of Auden and Isher-
wood's "The Ascent of F6" reached a
summit of achievement, on a par with
tat* attained by the central character in
e play itself. If it is surprising that the
Dramatic Sooiety should undertake this1
difficult enterprise, it is astonishing, in
the most pleasurable way, that they
should come up with a performance which
would do credit to many a professional
Of course, there were weaknesses. Per-
haps a couple of the parts were too much
•for the jactorsj, perhaps the lasti \sjcene
change was too long, but still the rihal
curtain left one a little breathless, over-
come by the profundity of it all. This
must have been what the authors in-
tended, and this was how it was.
Much of the credit must go to the pro-
ducer, Dick Saunders, who welded to-
gether a largely inexperienced cast and
squeezed from it caie of the outstanding
Dramatic Society productions of recent
years.
The main character, Michael Ransom,
striving to conquer the forbidden mount-
ain, gave Ross Butler the best part of his

College acting career. Ransom is a leader,
a man to look up to and respect. Ross
•Sutler gave him the leader's outward con-
fidence, out still carefully portrayed the
growing inner doubts which Ransom
had in himself and his ambitions. Never
did he fall into the trap of being over-
. drafmatid, iimpressijvely using the varied
dialogue to display his main asset, which
is a fine, rich, stage voice.
Two performances stood out like rare
gems. These came from Judith Jbewits, us
the syrupv, steeped in establishment trad-
ition Lady Isobel Welwyn, and from
Gillian Tilden-Smith, who, in the part of
Mrs. A., sympathetically portrayed the
eternal tedium and-drudgery, which is the
lot of the average housewife.
One could not help feeling sorry for
Roger Haddon and Jennifer Ellison, who
had the most difficult supporting roles.
The former tried to bring out the disint-
egration of the young climber, desperately
wanting to be chosen for the final assault
on the summit, but knowing he could not
face it if it should come. The tense, nerve
racking torture of waiting did not quite
come through,
Jennifer Ellison, as Ransom's mother,
was faced with an umenviable task. At
tHe best of times, it is difficult for a
young woman to act a middle aged one,
but when the part is as obscure as this,
it becomes nearly impossible. Miss Elli-
son did not grasp the 'significance of her
part (in common with most of the aud-
ience) and consequently, she never quite
made up her mind how to interpret it.
Neither she nor Roger Haddon need
be discouraged. They will surely in future
receive parts more amenable to their tal-
ents.
Alas, there is no space to mention alt
the others. SuTtice w say that each played
his part to his utmost ability and, a high
degree of ability wag apparent.
But mention must be made of the men
behind the stage. In all recent product-
ions, even when the performers have been,
below par, the quality of the sets, both
m design and construction, has reached,
the highest standards. This play required
several sets, and Hagen Jurke, Chris
Nicolas, Tony Shipley and their collegues
met the challenge with characteristic in-
genuity. Particularly impressive was a
blizzard scene, which was so realistic that
it drew spontaneous applause — or was
the clapping an attempt by the audience
tc keep warm?
It is to be hoped that in future more
people will think it worth-while to attend
Dramatic Society productions. For this
one, the audiences were well below cap^-
acity. /But -in all justice, the Concert
Hall should ihavfe been as overflowing
with people as the Dramatic Society is
with enthusiasm.

ASIAN
EVENING
Towards the end last term, I.C/s
Asian societies staged their annual "Asian
Evening". The pattern of such evening**
Was followed with the usual items, curio
stalls, Scabasre't, buffet and a most un-
Asian "hop".
The curio stalls with their carvings,
chopsticks and novelties differed little
from previous ones, the cabaret, however,
Was varied and of a high standard. The
Malayan candle dance which started the
programme was delightful with its subtle
intricacies, and contrasted with the
simpler and equally entertaining Indo-
nesian candle-dance later in the pro-
gramme. Of the two Chinese dances
given, the dexterity of the performers
was obvious in the sword dance, while
I.C.'s small stage jhampered the shawl
dances whose shawls looked a bit tired
after their round of College International
evenings. The vocal part of the cabaret
started off with a group of Malayan songs
in which the audience even joined. Two
songs were given, the first dolefully telling
of a broken hearted lover, while the other,
though supposedly in a lighter vein, dif-
fered in style and presentation. A group
of three songs by a Chinese tenor was
well presented, and the third in English,
for our benefit was especially well re-
ceived.
One of the highlights of the evening's
entertainment was a performance by a
Japanese guitarist, a former pupil of
Segovia and apparently a star in his own
right. With a seemingly effortless rippl-
ing of the fingers, he presented the in-
tricate scoring of two items of Spanish
guitar music showing what the instrum-
ent was capable of in the hands of a
more than competent player. The other,
and to me, the better, of the two high-
lights was a set of two Indian dances
presented by a young and beautiful Indian
girl. The first was a temple dance to the
Lord Krishna, which, were informed, was
only recently secularised for us mortals
to see. Even to the uninitiated and that
must have included nearly all of us pre-
sent, the grace and fluidity of motion
was breath-taking — from the delicate
shaping of the fingers, to the beautifully
sinuous motion of the arms., The second
dance, in praise of Spring, was as techn-
ically brilliant as the first, while the
Unquestioned imagery evolled could have
impressed even t
*
h
e dullest brown-bagger.
Stage lighting was good throughout most
of the cabaret, but non-existent in the
last number where it could been used to
great advantage. A note of appreciation
to the M.C.'s, the Silver toungued Ash-
fag Qureshi and the more down to earth
and equally amusifng Wing Kong.
A novel attraction was the sale of Jap-
anese rice wine, sake, and Chinese millet
wine, Kao Liang. The sake was enjoyable,
though the rougher and more potent
Chinese wine hit our throats with a bang.
In the line of solid refreshment, the hut-
Mt was tasty,, small, (and choice fcon-
existant.
IMBIBAGE FOR WOMEN AT LAST!
At last the sorties of the dreaded Misses
Bradford into one of the last wholly male
preserves of 1.0. have had their effect.
Certain members of Weeks Hall unable to
resist the pitiful cries of the dypsomaniacs
in ICWA for alcohol, have decided to sup-
ply the long awaited opportunity, for
mixed drinking in I.CI
A bar, wonderful word, has opened
in Weeks Hall which wili admit the
fairer sex within its precints. From
7.30 (p.m.) to 10.30 (p.m.) on six days
a week licenced drug taking (alcohol) will
take place in the lower lounge of Weeks
Hall. Join us this eveing before the May
Ball.
