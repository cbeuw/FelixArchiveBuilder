Phoenix
The arts magazine
of Imperial College
Phoenix is the arts magazine companion
to Felix. It has existed for more than one
hundred years, and was originally edited by
H. G. Wells.
This term we’re looking to publish the first
issue in three years, which will be followed
up by another issue in the summer. If you’re
interested in creative writing such as short
stories and poems, or drawing comics, or
photography or if you want to make some of
your own suggestions, contact the Phoenix
