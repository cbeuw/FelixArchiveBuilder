Southwell Hall is one of four halls of residence located around Evelyn
Gardens, just off the Fulham Road in South Kensington. It houses 185

six floors.

activities for students. There is now an opportunity to be part of this
highly motivated team.

particularly well suited to second or third year undergraduates that have
lived in halls before. Applicants should be friendly, lively, resourceful,
energetic, responsible and able to work in a team.
Application forms can be obtained from the Accommodation Office or
