Candidates’ manifestos in next week’s issue of Felix and on Live!
Nominations for next year’s Sabbati-
cal team, Student Trustees and NUS
delegates closed on Sunday night (at
one minute to midnight to be precise)
revealing the potential 2008/09 Presi-
dent and Deputy Presidents. Sabbati-
cal positions, or Sabbs – which include
the offices of Deputy President Finance
& Services (DPFS), Deputy President
Clubs & Societies (DPCS) and Deputy
PresidentEducation&Welfare(DPEW)
alongside the office of Union President
and Felix Editor – last for a year and
are taken up by current students either
during their degree or after their final
year. Alongside the Sabbs, candidates
for the eight NUS delegate positions
were also revealed (they are the people
who will be representing the Union at
the NUS conference between 1st and
3rd April this year) along with the two
potential Student Trustees (students
who sit on the Trustee Board which
oversees the Union).
The position of President appears
to have the most heated competition
with six candidates vying for the job.
Current Royal College of Science Un-
ion (RCSU) President Jennifer Mor-
gan, Athletic Clubs Committee (ACC)
Chair Luke Taylor and former DPFS
Jon Matthews all fulfilled Felix’s proph-
esy (cast your over-eager eyes back to
issue 1,391) by running for President.
Alongside these faces, former Fe-
lix columnist Diogo Geraldes, Choir
Treasurer Edward Hughes and City
and Guilds College Union (CGCU)
Honorary Secretary Edward Judge are
also in the competition.
The next most hotly-contested po-
sition is DPCS with Felix correctly
predicting only one candidate, Lily
Topham, Social Clubs Committee
(SCC) Chair for this role. Alongside Ms
Topham is John James, stalwart of the
RCS Motor Club and Jess Marley the
Netball Club Captain. The diversity of
candidates can only make for a promis-
ing contest with perhaps differing fo-
cuses and purposes. DPEW is going to
be fought between two familiar faces:
SCC Secretary Ryan Dee (as predicted
by Felix) and Welfare Campaigns Of-
ficer Hannah Theodorou. Poker Soci-
ety Treasurer Christian Carter is the
sole student candidate for DPFS other
than the possibility of re-opening
nominations – this may not provide
the most thrilling of contests for a role
that is often deficient of candidates.
Obviously the most important po-
sition, Felix Editor, has drawn three
experienced candidates from the cur-
rent Felix team in Nightlife Editor Gre-
gory Mead, Sports Editor Jovan Nedić
and News Editor Andrew Somerville.
However, at the time of going to press
Andrew has expressed his desire to
withdraw from the race due to disillu-
sionment with the role of Felix at this
university (see page 3).
There are eleven candidates for the
eight NUS delegate positions and two
candidates for the two Student Trus-
tee positions; these roles are not to be
ignored.
For each field in the election students
have the opportunity to vote for Re-
Open Nominations (RON) if none of
the candidates float your boat. If RON
wins, nominations will be opened up
again for another election.
One thing is for sure this year; there
are many experienced and familiar
faces and that the joke candidate factor
(proportional to the farce factor) is at
an all-time low. This means that Hus-
tings (the candidates’ chance to con-
vince you to vote for them in a public
forum) might be relatively farce-free
with competency rather than pint-
downing as the order of the day. Might
be...
There will be Hustings on Monday
18th February at 12pm in the JCR and
on Thursday 21st February at 6:30pm
in DaVinci’s. Look out for the candi-
dates’ manifestos in next week’s Felix
and on Live! (http://live.cgcu.net).
Voting opens online on Friday 22nd
February at one minute past midnight
and closes Tuesday 26th February at
one minute to midnight.
Remember that you are voting for
the future of the Union and if you are
leaving this year, then it is a good way
to get back at the College for giving you
a third. Resentful, moi?
Lord Winston entertains
Imperial students for hours
The last of the RCSU Science Challenge seminars was given
by fertility expert Lord Robert Winston on Tuesday night. Lord
Winston discussed his question: “Ever since early humans
invented the handaxe, technology has increased the potential
to destroy mankind. Are we sowing the seeds of our own
destruction?” It was intended that he would talk for 20 minutes
but he ended up speaking for an hour and a half. On top of this,
Lord Winston took questions from the floor for the next hour. At
one point his wife phoned; Lord Winston explained that he was
going to be late and she should start dinner without him. Students
have just over a week to submit their competition entries. For
more information head to: www.rcsu.org.uk/sciencechallenge
Oh, hi Mrs Lord Winston. I’m busy being
a legend and answering everyone’s
questions. I’ll be home soon; you had
better start dinner without me. Bye for now.
