A
big hello to everyone.
After four years as edi-
tor, Greg has decided to
dedicate all his spare
time to growing a beard
so I’ve valiantly offered to take over
the position of nightlife editor. Hope-
fully, during our time together, I’ll be
able to reveal another side of London’s
nightlife scene. This week I’ve decided
to be a rebel and try and influence you
all to branch out, boycott Freshers
week II and get visiting some of Lon-
don’s best clubs.
I’m also looking for some new night-
life reviewers as everyone here at Felix
nightlife is getting old and leaving, so
some fresh young writers would be
marvellous.
I’m going to be bringing you the
best in drum ‘n’ bass, dub step, reggae,
electro, house and hip hop nights,
predominantly because that’s what I
like and that’s what the best nights in
London are playing.
Watch out in the next few weeks
for the world’s most amazing com-
petition. Well not really, it’s pretty
standard, I want you to send me in any
photos of your nights out in London.
The messiest photo wins (obviously).
Even if it’s just a photo of you alone in
the union trying to fit a pint glass in
your mouth, send it in, and immense
prizes are promised.
Finally, we’ve been asked by the
lovely Green Week organisers to
mention their extra special event next
Friday. An extravaganza of DJs, live
musicians, an Ethical Fashion Show
and other entertainment in aid of
Friends of the Earth. Featuring Kash-
mere, Jazz T (ITC Champ ‘01), Lazy
DJ, Alejandro Toledo and other great
acts. Free before 10pm, £2 after, with
drinks promotions all night. So if you
can make it, pop along and help save
the entire world.
Also, a by-note, peace and love.

the phrase munchies to a whole other
level. The barbecue outside even sells
burgers with halloumi on top for a very
reasonable price.
Although café 1001 is not techni-
cally a nightclub, from 10pm the back
room turns into an amazing drum ‘n’
bass area with great tunes being played
until closing time. It’s only downfall is
Felix went undercover to discover where in London is truly best for a week of drum
‘n’ bass, rock, hip hop, electro and just general naughtiness. The results were filthy

Nightlife
Nightlife Editor – Francesca O’Hanlon
We’ve seen the posters for Freshers
week II on the walkway, in the union
and randomly, on the pavement of Ex-
hibition road, and we’re less than im-
pressed. Tiger Tiger? Again? Really?
No. So we’ve decided to create the
ultimate week in messy student nights
across London to show just how much
better we can do it. Be prepared to re-
alise that nightlife outside of Picadilly
exists, for a week long hangover, and
for the high possibility of losing an
item of clothing... perhaps a shoe.
Each night is based around a differ-
ent type of music, to cater for every-
one’s needs and fetishes. Monday night
sees DJs 2tall Matman and Sharma play
at the centrally located Bar Rumba.
Where, coincidentally, at the age of 16
I threw up on the bouncer’s shoes, and
he still let me in. Proof of the relaxed
(or stupid?) atmosphere. Tuesday is the
student funk night Flirt at the Garden-
ing club where Moby’s tour DJ is play-
ing (DJ Kharrington). Wednesday is
one of the priciest nights of the week
but definitely worth visiting if your
a fan of rock music with Brady Cole
headlining just back from touring with
the Foo Fighters.
Café 1001 is one of the best kept se-
crets of London. Located just off Brick
Lane, this place sums up everything I
love about east London, and every-
thing that South Kensington lacks.
1001 is a cafe/bar/club/barbecue/pic-
nic area. While a lot of it’s charm has
been taken away by the smoking ban.
(Before the introduction of the ban, the
upstairs floor of 1001 felt similar to be-
ing on the inside of a giant bong) The
food here is amazing, with an over-

House-Trained looking for
new DJ’s and producers
Currently working on a series of new
releases for the year ahead, the new
outfit House-Trained is on the hunt for
hot new DJs and production talent to
work with them in 2008.
House-Trainedissizinguptobecome
a big new player on the scene in the lat-
ter half of 2008. Focusing on bringing
quality house music to the masses, the
label has a wealth of resources at their
finger tips to help nurture and break
new talent.
Label head Phil Loraine said to us the
other day: “The advent of the digital
distribution age has propelled dance
music into previously unchartered ter-
ritory now and opened new doors for
DJs and producers on all levels. Eve-
rything is so accessible we are seeing a
level playing field again; gone are the
days when the scene was dominated
by a small elite. It is an aspiration of
mine to spread the net even further by
sourcing the best new DJs and produc-
ers in the UK and beyond and offering
them a platform”
If you’re an aspiring house DJ or pro-
ducer you can submit your tracks and
demos to the label for the chance to get
hired! Send CDs only (which regret-
tably cannot be returned), along with
your contact details to:
House-Trained
5th Floor
364-366 Kensington High Street
London W14 8NS
In addition to the label itself, 2008 is
about to be set alight with the first of
their House-Trained parties.
The official label launch party kicks
off at The Island on Saturday February
16th headlined by none other than DJ
Disciple himself, plus guests Audiow-
hores (MN2S), Jaded’s Raymundo Ro-
driguez, acid house wizard Steve Proc-
tor (Shoom), The Layabouts and Phil
Loraine & Stu Hall.
With such an abundance of talent
crammed into London’s most intimate
new hotspot, this looks set to be the
most talked about party of the year so
far, so what are you waiting for? Get
those demos in the post for the chance
to be the next superstar DJ and you will
be reeling in hookers and blow before
you can say, “Peaches Geldof.”

the lack of a late night license, but the
majority of the crowd spills into 93 feet
east which is a few drunken seconds
walk around the corner.
Friday night sees the big finale with of
course Fabric. Despite the ever increas-
ing number of tourists and 15 year olds
coming here on a Friday, Fabric is still
without a doubt one of the best nights
in London (damn expensive though),
with the likes of 2ManyDJs and Simian
Mobile Disco playing, the 22nd looks
set to be a big one.
So tie up your shoelaces, put on a
wife-beater and get ready for a week
of epic partying to make you remem-
ber why London has the best clubbing
scene in the whole of Middlesex and a
bit of Essex and a couple of other coun-
ties too.
