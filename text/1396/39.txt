Logic Puzzle: Guilty Secrets
Using the clues and logical deduction
alone, work out how all the people
involved in the match relate to each
other. The puzzle can be solved with-
out guesswork. Make use of the grid to
mark the combinations that you know.
Read through each clue and make any
obvious or stated deductions. Find the
corresponding row and column on the
grid and place a tick for ‘Yes’ in the box,
and a cross for ‘No’ in the cells next to
this one vertically and horizontally.
Five candidates in the forthcoming
Gimperial sabbatical elections have a
guilty secret each. Can you work out
from the clues who the candidate is,
what their secret is, what position they
are standing for and how their secret
was outed!
1. Naughty Muppet (who didn’t have a

tor was outed (surprisingly) by Felix,
whose staff were clearly outraged and
slightly scared.
3. Lizard is running for DPCS and was
outed by Stoic in a shock expose in-
cluding actual footage.
4. Aussie has an affinity to gay haircuts,
because he’s worth it. He could often
be seen mincing around college, strik-
ing poses at his reflection in windows.
5. The person who has a secret love-
child was named and shamed by IC
Radio. They admitted the child and the
father, which turned out to be a cur-
rent sabatical officer!
6. Tweedle Dee was running for Presi-
dent, but turned out to be a bigamist
(with no less than 5 partners). What
is amazing is that the 5 partners didn’t
realise!
