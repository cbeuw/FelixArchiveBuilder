(the diffusion col-
lection) was an 80’s
affair, with plenty
of nipped in waists,
bubble and lamp-shade skirts, over-
sized houndstooth prints, and playful
bursts of colour.
Benjamin Cho showed a playful col-
lection, crafty and surely a hit with the
art school crowd. I know I’ll be order-

out pieces, but the theme didn’t course

Korean/African American. It’s sad that Chanel wasn’t the stand out
star from a range of Black and Asian models as well as Caucasian.
