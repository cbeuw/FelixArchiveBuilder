well as for the fastest teams such as
the traditional ‘craziest torch’.
It’s open to anyone and everyone.
You do as much or as little activity as
you want, and you choose how fast
you go, how far to go and when to
finish. Teams of two, three or four
people may enter. Although most
teams will represent a specific club
or groups of students, anyone- even
from the world outside of Imperial-

place in a fortnight on the Saturday
23rd February.
News in brief
The Night Hike is coming
Imperial Team of the Week
IC Volleyball Women’s 1st
The ladies 1st volleyball team have had a great season so far. They were un-
beaten in the league and yesterday they defeated Team Bath in the BUSA
knockout stage and are one match away from the finals. Well done girls!
Hope to hear about the game next week!
This year’s night hike will be taking
place in the Wendover area of the
Chiltern Hills – a new venue, featur-
ing glorious moonlit hillsides and
dark scary forests! Transport can
be provided from South Kensington,
and will cost an extra £7 or so. Entry
to the event is £5 for IC students.
The actual aim of the evening is to
visit as many checkpoints as possible
in a set amount of time. Points will
be awarded for each checkpoint vis-
ited. The team with the most points
wins. Three different categories
(Novice/Competent/Runner) cater

The day had finally come for the newly
formed ICU Gaelic Football Club, as
we took to the field on Sunday after-
noon for a hard-fought and spirited
match against local rivals Oxford Uni-
versity. Without an official home pitch
for IC, and only one training session
so far, the team made the journey up
the M40 fully confident in our abilities
and looking forward to what would be
a hard hitting encounter.
Despite the strong breeze which kept
scoring low throughout the game, the
pitch was in good shape and allowed for
plenty of open play. Oxford started the
game brightly, if very arrogantly, trying
their luck with at least four pot shots
at goal from close range, all expertly
kept out by keeper Mus Botchway and
aided by some frenetic defending by
the full and half back lines marshalled
by Eddie O’Hare. Inspired by our de-
fence and long kick-outs into the wind,
the IC team began to take the game to
Oxford. Midfield duo, Finian McCann
and Gaelic football debutant Danny
Wilson were outstanding in midfield,
competing for possession and feeding
the Forwards with some quality ball,
despite the rough and high tackles
coming in from all sides by the dirty
Oxford old boys frustrated at the lack
of time afforded them on the ball – or
maybe just the dig to the mouth Finain
gave to his marker. Half time came and
IC left the field only four points down,
by no means an insurmountable task.
After passionate words from Club
Captain Frank O’Neill, we retook the
field with every intention of grabbing
the next score. Several attempts and
some scoreable free-kicks later, ham-
pered by the breeze, IC were unlucky
not to be on even terms. Oxford made
full use of the wind and pressed their
advantage by moving their target man
directly in front of the goals to get the
better of full-back Andrew Lavery by

continually sending high balls in over
the top. Despite several saves and solid
defending IC made some silly mis-
takes and conceded some soft goals,
the score line not reflecting the match
being played at all. The second half
played out with some neat play from
forwards Doyle, Phelan and Carville
always threatening to score but IC
eventually came off the field, defeated
but still proud of a very respectable
performance.
Special mention must be made to
skilful performance of ‘Man of the
Match’, Pat McMullen playing like a
natural despite only learning the rules
of Gaelic watching a match down at the
Union on Saturday night and reading
Wikipedia the next morning. Depend-
able performance from Freshers; Gal-
lagher, Davis, Jakeman and Gill are all
worth mention and with further work
ICUGFC are certain to perform well
in the upcoming BUSA tournament in
Birmingham – only one week away!
If anyone is interested in playing
drop an e-mail to al306@ic.ac.uk or
check out the Facebook group. We will
be training on Sunday morning.
