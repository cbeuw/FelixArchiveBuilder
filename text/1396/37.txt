This week Felix
wants to tell you
that Your mum
broke money
from the placenta
occasions. So
never like for him as he is a dirty poo who
will continue to rape your granny until he
has enough money with which to buy Thai
lady-boys and then still claim that back on the
rover expenses. He is and will always remain a
source of AIDS in Africa.
Scorpio
It is a scientifically
proven fact that
Lithuanians
are the world’s
best comedians.
Comedy is such an
accepted way of life in Lithuania that instead
of exchanging greetings upon meeting,
Lithuanians exchange nob-gags or gentle satire
depending on the formality of the occasions.
The nation’s fish is wet and plentiful whilst
promoting healthy back-hair growth.
Libra
Mars is pointing
North-East suggest-
ing that it is finally
time to make the
move to Africa.
Embrace chickens
on public transport, greet the maggots on the
toilet seat and don’t fall into the sewer on your
way home from your wild-night out consum-
ing the local brew.

Sagittarius
Okay, this is
between me and
you. I think Nicola
Roberts from Girls
Aloud is actually
pretty fit. I know
what you’re thinking, “But she is the weakest
link in the uber-girl pop girl-group.” I don’t
know but when she scrunches up her offen-
sive ginger face I melt a little inside. She just
switches on that part of me that finds abba-
toirs sexy and cancerous tumours erotic.
Capricorn
This week’s
horoscopes were
brought to you
by the Lithuanian
Tourist Board. If
you wish to visit
Lithuania, it is only reachable by wild-boar or
paper aeroplane. All questions regarding the
censored text can be sent to Stephen Brown
c/o Imperial College Union, Beit Quad, Prince
Consort Road, London SW7 2BB.
Cancer
You are insulted
by the distorted
stereotype that is
Gemini’s horoscope.
You write into Felix
and receive this
reply: “Dear Sir/Madam,
Please fuck off and die. Please find enclosed an
axe with which to end your pathetic life.
Luv ya bye LOL,
Felix.”
Gemini
Okay, okay I’ve got
one for you. A guy
walks into a bar and
his trousers are on
fire, he walks up
to the barman and
says, “Can I have a lager please?” The barman
says, “Wait a second, your legs are on fire.”
Aggravated, the man ablaze retorts, “Excuse
me, I believe you’ll see above that in this
horoscope only my trousers were referred to,
not my legs.” He must’ve gone to Imperial.
Leo
Lithuania is situated
along the south-
eastern shore of
the Baltic Sea,
sharing borders
with Latvia to the
north, Belarus to the southeast, Poland, and
the Russian exclave of the Kaliningrad Oblast
to the southwest. Lithuania’s 7th best export is
holes and hole manufacture employs at least 2
million Lithuanians who pride themselves on
their well-groomed back-hair.
Taurus
There are about
4 million native
speakers of
the Lithuanian
language. It is of the
Baltic family of the
Indo-European group of languages. Lithuanian
is believed to be related very closely to the
roots of the original stem Indo-European
language. In order to be able to speak
Lithuanian you must be holding a ram in one
arm and a flute wedged into a leg-wound.
Aries
So you have a
girlfriend. Well.
Fucking. Done.
There is at least one
person on Earth
who doesn’t realise
you for the fetid boil-plagued trauma that you
are. You tell everyone you meet that you have
obtained a significant other and your opinions
are valid because you found a sperm recepticle
with even lower a self-esteem than you.
Pisces
This week Valdus
Adamkus, the
Lithuanian
President calls you
up suggesting a
meet-up where you
can exchange ideas about Eastern European
regeneration. You inform him that Kristijonas
Donelaiti is your favourite Lithuanian author
and admire Metai, the first ever Lithuanian
poem. Well done, your ability to improvise has
endeared you to the Lithuanian elite.

Aquarius
Your cuff-link fixa-
tion is unsolved by
Needy’s so-called
advice. Afterwards
in a fit of rage you
impale every item
of clothing you own thus each garment able of
supporting cuff-links. You feel a life of fighting
crime awaits and you called yourself ‘Cuff-
link Man’. You die in a gunfight the next day
fighting Athlete’s Foot Boy. You were a shit
superhero.

Needy McNeedy: here to deproblemize yo’ life
S
eeing the good effects that
my pearls of wisdom have
been effervescing around
campus has spurred me on to
new heights of advice. Thank
you for the barrage of emails, keep on
sending them (agony.felix@imperial.
ac.uk) and I’ll try my best to answer
them.
Dear Needy Mc Needy,
I’ve started to go out with a girl from
another University, who’s doing a degree
in Female Asian Immigrants in Europe
in the 1950’s (BA Hons). The problem
is; she only has half a lecture every week
and stays in bed until 4pm every day. I
do Geology but have started missing my
2 lectures a week because I can’t bring
myself to throw her out of bed when she
stays at my house? Love is ruining my
degree. What can I do?
Desperate
Dear Desperate
You could bribe someone on your
course to go to lectures for you with
chocolate. But, seriously, you can’t
keep letting this girl control your life;
just because she wants to get a mean-
ingless degree, don’t throw yours away
for her. Will she still be with you when
you fail? Probably not. Use the old
tried and tested duvet yank; grab duvet
by two corners, and pull sharply, works
a treat.

Dear Needy McNeedy
I’ve got this boyfriend, and we’ve been
going out with each other for 3 months.
We met through Sci Fi Soc (I joined to
get the DVD boxsets of Buffy, but when
I went to get them, nobody noticed I
was female because they were too busy
playing Warhammer and I ran away
and never went back.) and were getting
on really well until I realised that he
never talks about anything apart from
his degree. I’m so bored of listening to
him bang on about fourier transforms,
and event horizons, and that paradox
with the computer program which tests
if any other computer program will run
forever. Please help.
PsiPhiGroupie
Dear PsiPhiGroupie
It must be infectious; why don’t you
shut up about him talking about his
degree and then he might follow suit.
You think you’ve got problems? Those
****s in the H to the O to the R to the O
to the Sizzle Copes section have taken
a disliking to me and have started to
lick my elbows whilst I type… They’re
following me. I can tell.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy Mc Needy
I’ve just got my first piece of coursework
back, and they gave me an F! I’ve never
got such a low mark before, being top
of my class at school and everything.
Admittedly I did the coursework on a
dancing podium one night out without
pens and paper, so I can see why they
thought it was substandard. But I’m
now left with a mark sheet exclaiming
how badly I’ve performed. What shall
I do?
ClassPrefect
Dear ClassPrefect
Find a utilities cupboard in your house
that may already contain any of the fol-
lowing: boiler, vacuum cleaner, clean-
ing products. Fold the offending item
7 times (is this really the maximum
number of times you can fold a bit of
paper?) Place item in the cupboard,
close the cupboard door. Warn house-
mates not to go near the cupboard (if
you chose a cleaning cupboard, your
housemates will probably thank you
and gladly oblige). Problem solved! In-
cidentally, this method works with all
problems, including your degree, any
ex boyfriends or girlfriends, or calen-
dar months which didn’t go as planned.
Try harder next time, or carry on par-
tying and repeat the above method.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy,
I have a cuff-link fixation. No matter
what I’m wearing, I have to wear cuff-
links. I find they lend me a regal splen-
dour. However, this cuff adornment
related zealously has led to rather per-
tinent impracticalities such as swallow-
ing them whilst feasting over-actively
on chicken feet. Please tell me how I can
remedy such a desire with such an hec-
tic modern existence.

Get out of my column Matty!
