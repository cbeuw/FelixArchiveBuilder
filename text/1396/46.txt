meant I had extra food at night and I
also had a cappuccino.
Tuesday, 05 February 2008:
Breakfast: 2 pieces of Weetabix with
approximately 150 ml of milk
Snack: An apple and a banana
Lunch: A chickpea and sweet corn
salad (handful), with shreds of baked
chicken, quarter of a cucumber, lettuce
and a carrot topped off with lemon and
pepper.
Dinner: 5-6 tablespoons of biryani
with potatoes and a piece of chicken.
Activity: Walking to and from the
station at a brisk pace approximately
15 minutes. 30 minutes cardio on the
cycle and rower combined at a fairly
intense level but keeping sure I was in
the cardio zone with my heart rate.
Review: The day went well but as I
was hungry towards dinner time I had
a much larger serving than I usually
do.
By joining the weight management
programme I’ve become more aware
of what I’m eating and have to recog-
nise the power of treats (in modera-
tion of course!) to keep me motivated,
which also means I get to enjoy what
I eat more since I’m not mindlessly
stuffing myself and feeling guilty after-
wards. I’m also never hungry and I am
eating all the time because I snack on
things like fruit or nuts or dried fruit or
low-calorie things and still manage to
lose weight and speed up my metabo-
lism as well. I’m more active now and
try to make it to the gym 3-4 times a
week even if it is for half an hour. If I
have more time I’ll do my weight train-
ing routine and I spend an hour to an
hour-and-a-half on one of the cardio
machines. Sometimes I go to classes
and will do half-an-hour cardio after
the class if I have time. I’ve also realised
that I get bored with cardio really eas-
ily but it’s the best way to beat fat, so
I make a point of changing machines
and doing interval training so it doesn’t
get too mundane. By doing cardio and
weight training, I am getting rid of
body fat by burning it off and develop-
ing muscle, so it’s kind of like a two-
way attack on fat!

Only one more mouthful…?
Linda Hagg

One of the participants of Ethos’
weight management programme has
been willing to share her experiences
of the programme and tell us how she
is getting on. She kept a food diary for
three days and recorded how physi-
cally active she was.
Keeping a food diary is a good way
to monitor what and how much you
eat in order to improve your diet. You
will also be able to ensure you have a
balanced diet, eating food from all
food groups. It can help you create an
awareness of unnecessary food and
snacks you eat or it can stop you from
eating that extra biscuit. Sometimes
you eat more than you think without
even realising it….
My food diary:
I have lost roughly half a stone in
the past 4 weeks although last week I
ended up gaining a bit of weight, due to
being extremely busy and having to at-
tend two parties during the week. Pre-
viously I’ve lost weight through a com-
bination of cardio and weight training
which did work but then after a blip of
couple of weeks and not going to the
gym, it just ended up in me putting the
weight back on. Not being aware of
‘hidden calories’ for example in lattes
etc. and going for things like cakes to
avoid having a chocolate bar ( I didn’t
realise I was going for the higher fat,
sugar and calorie option!) has been one
of the reasons for me not being able to
stay at my desired weight.
Sunday, 03 February 2008:
Breakfast: 2 pieces of Weetabix with
approximately 150 ml of milk and a
cup of tea with semi-skimmed milk
and two teaspoons of sugar
Snack: A Cadbury cake bar, a pear
and a banana and a 2-slices Go-ahead
yoghurt breaks
Lunch: A chickpea salad (handful),
with a small baked potato, quarter of
a cucumber, a little onion and 2 car-
rots topped off with lemon and chat
masala.
Dinner: Very late. 2 chapattis and a
low fat homemade chicken curry ap-
proximately 150 ml of curry with a
piece of chicken.
Activity: General house chores, as it
was a rest day.
Review: The day could’ve gone better
but mistimed meals and did not have
enough healthy snacks in the house
which meant that I overindulged. I was
also busy with work which meant I was
stressed out and not giving enough
thought to what I was eating.
