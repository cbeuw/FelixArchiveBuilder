 SECOND ROUND RECRUITMENT 
Letters to Felix
Dear Sir,
Friday is, as you can imagine, a rather
stressful time for us Ph.D. students,
with end-of-week deadlines, tutorial
marking that can't go over the week-
end, and many other activities requir-
ing our attention during the precious
minutes that tick away to the weekend
(which in my case is somewhere be-
tween 6 and 8 p.m. on Friday depend-
ing on when IC Dance Soc manage to
book a room for their Salsa classes).
Recently, I have discovered Slither-
link in your fabulous publication, and
have been using it as a distraction from
all this stress – a kind of escape – for
a few precious minutes over lunch. I
particularly enjoy the lateral thinking
that is involved in solving such a puz-
zle, and, despite me being in the com-
puting department, have not yet felt
the need to create my own automated
computer solver for the puzzle.
Recently I have noticed that the tech-
niques required to solve slitherlink are
becoming more and more lateral. This
week, the step was particularly lateral,
in the literal sense. Just as I got stuck, I
realised the solution was staring me in
the face … slightly to the right of where
my pen was currently placed.
I am also faced with a feeling of deja-
vu, being sure that I have actually seen
this puzzle before, last week perhaps?
However, on closer inspection the so-
lution which was horizontally offset is
not identical to the problem I currently
face (and have faced before). A mystery
2 seems to have appeared thatmakes
things seem less ambiguous.
And now I will get to the thrust of
this email: Have I spent so long staring
at the dots and lines that madness has
ensued or has this happened to your-
self or your good staff?
Kindest regards,
Tristan Allwood
Ph.D. Student
Thanks to everyone who pointed this
out. Honestly. Every last one of you. It
won’t happen again!
Lateral thinking:
Slitherlink woes
Fun with
apostrophe’s and
swear words
Sir,
I read with much enjoyment the article
entitled "Got more cash than sense?"
until I reached paragraph five, sen-
tence one in which the writer states:
"... and 8Gb's of flash storage built-in".
I do believe that according to the Ox-
ford Dictionary of Style (Oxford being
a University, much like ours) the an
apostrophe before an 's' is the sole do-
main of the Greengrocer.
Furthermore I wish to issue a fresh
complaint over the character immei-
dately preceding the one about which
I have just complained. The unit 'gi-
gabyte' is abbreviated thus: 'Gb'. An
abbreviation of 'Gb' would signify one
gigabit which is a significantly small-
er quantity than the one I might be
so bold as to presume the writer had
intended.
I suspect that the oversights I men-
tion have been faithfully reproduced in
every single copy of felix printed this
week, and therefore that my copy is not
an anomaly, however, since I have not
paid for the copy of Felix about which I
am writing I shall not expect any mon-
etary recompense from yourselves.
In addition to the above complaints
(whichIbelievetobesufficientgrounds
for a full and frank appology issued
by yourselves to your perfectly well-
intended readers) I would like to issue
one further complaint about the use of
the common vernacular in a published
medium. On page 35 the headline of
an otherwise very enjoyable article
reads "Oh sweet, sweet CNUT". If we
are to believe that these letters might
(by some series of random experi-
ments constituting a stochastic proc-
ess) become rearranged then there is
significant chance that the headline
could display something ultimately of-
fensive. As shown recently in a study
by Cambridge University which you
yourselves mentioned in an issue last
year, the order of the intermediary let-
ters in a word is not important to the
overall cognition - a fact about which I
doubt, Sir, you are ignorant. Therefore
I believe it to be an act of wilful sin that
"Oh sweet, sweet CNUT" was printed
with full knowledge that it will be in-
terpreted as common slang for an area
of the female undercarriage.
Yours,
James Dicken

SCR letter
clarification
Dear Felix,
Following up from the letter I submit-
ted to Felix last month concerning the
Senior Common Room, I would like to
give some feedback from a meeting I
had with Jane Neary, Head of Catering
and Conferencing in the SCR; Chileya
Kasuba, Faculty and Postgraduate co-
ordinator; and several other MSc stu-
dents. My letter questioned the cur-
rent rule that taught masters students
are not allowed to buy or eat food in
the SCR, and thus do not have a des-
ignated area to have lunch or coffee. It
also highlighted the shocking behav-
iour of a member of Imperial academic
staff.
I would like to clarify that my com-
plaint was not directed at any mem-
bers of the catering staff. As far as I am
aware, the catering staff have always
been polite and amenable to all cus-
tomers, and they try hard to balance
the demands of both the academics
and students. I apologise if the letter
caused any misunderstanding or upset
to anyone within the catering team.
The meeting covered both short-
term and long-term solutions to the
SCR rules issue, and a proposal will
be submitted to the SCR committee
in due course. It is this committee that
makes the decisions about who is al-
lowed into the SCR. In the mean time,
I would like to emphasise the fact that
MSc students do not currently have
a designated place to eat and meet,
whether it be to discuss work over a
coffee or to catch up over lunch.

Tom Roberts responds:
Ah, the annual pedantry letter. I’ve
been expecting you, albeit with not
quite such an amusing tone.
Mr. Dicken: Thank you for bringing a
smile to my face on such inane topics.
You are of course correct on both counts
and my frank apology is forthcoming:
Sorry.
I have brutally beaten the editors
responsible for the apostrophe calam-
ity and burned the pages of the Oxford
Dictionary of Style onto their retinas.
Unfortunately I have run out of soap.
Not only am I an incredibly pungent
individual, the Felix staffers’ mouths
remain as obscene as ever.
