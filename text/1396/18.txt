Recently I was intrigued by a police
cordon set up in Hyde Park not far across
the road from the Union Building. These
scenes spark illusions of crime and
intrigue and exciting ideas of CSI-style
police dramas. I was horrified to learn
later that a young girl had been sexually
assaulted right on our very doorstep and
this suddenly brought the whole thing
into stark contrast.
Unfortunately crimes are not uncommon
in Hyde Park. Thefts and mugging are
a regular occurrence and approximately
once a month a CID officer is called in
to investigate a more serious crime. And
it doesnâ€™t stop there, absent mindedly
holding the door open into the Sherfield
Building a few weeks back I was
surprised to meet two extremely polite
police officers walking in the opposite
direction with a rather more sullen
looking guy in handcuffs between them.
I know first hand that crime can occur
even when you feel safe on campus.
During a spate of thefts last year I lost
my favourite handbag with my brand
new phone, my lecture notes, a really
nice pair of earrings and all my bank
cards. My sympathy extended however
to a friend who had two instruments
stolen on the same day, most likely
mistaken for laptop cases.
There are steps
and precautions
that we can
take to protect
ourselves
from crime.
For example
you should
never take a
short cut across the park after dark, it
just isnâ€™t worth the extra ten minutes
you will save. You should always keep
your belongings with you and in sight
at all times. But what can the College
and the Local Authorities do to make
you feel safe on campus and in South
Kensington? Westminster City Council
have launched a survey to find out
student opinions on how safe they are
on campus and what can be done to
make you feel safer. If a stronger police
presence is comforting and means you
might stay longer in your department
in the evenings then let us know.
Alternatively, if seeing uniformed police
officers patrolling the campus would
make you feel uneasy we would really
like to know about that too.
Fill in the survey by following the link on
our website. Let us know which campus
you are on too if you arenâ€™t based at
South Kensington. The Survey Closes on
29th February 2008.

Looking to the future - Meet
the Candidates
Nominations have closed and the race to
the electoral finishing line has begun. For
these elections 2 hustings will be held so
that students can have the opportunity to
hear what the candidates have to say for
themselves and you will have the chance
to ask some probing questions of those
who are competing to help run the Union
next year. Hustings times are as follows
JCR Hustings
12pm Monday 18 February
Elections Bar Night
6.30pm Thursday 21 February in
da Vincis, Beit Quad.
Free drinks will be on offer at the
Elections Bar Night on Thursday where
you can have the additional pleasure of
meeting your potential NUS Delegates,
Student Trustees and Sabbatical
Officers.
Voting for the elections will open online
at midnight straight after the hustings
and will close at midnight on the evening
of Tuesday 26 February. To vote log on
to www.imperialcollegeunion.org/vote
during this period.
The Present â€“ last chance
to complete the Higher
Education Funding Survey
For those of you who have missed
the previous publicity the survey can
still be accessed online at www.
imperialcollegeunion.org/hesurvey.
The survey will close this Sunday and
the results so far have raised many
interesting questions for various
committees of elected representatives
to address. Look out for a full report on
the survey results, what was said and
what Union policy it resulted in over
the coming weeks. Once the survey is
closed the prize draw can take place and
all the winners will be announced in Felix
along with the survey analysis.
Looking to the past - Last
weeks Tri-College Social
Imperial College has just celebrated
its 100th birthday but last week saw
some of the old Constituent College
Unionâ€™s celebrate their history. Students
democratically decided to keep referring
the Royal College of Science Union,
City and Guilds College Union and Royal
School of Mines Union despite the fact
that neither of the old Colleges exist in
the Faculty structure of Imperial College.
It is excellent to see so many of the
old traditions kept going in to the 21st
Century and it is good thing that this rich
history can be accommodated by the
Union today.
More elections notices!
After the sabbatical elections we roll
straight in to elections for the positions
of RAG Chair, CAG Chair, the Chair
of Union Council and Faculty Union
elections. This might seem like a bit of
a democratic overload but the elections
timetable for
these will be as
follows.
