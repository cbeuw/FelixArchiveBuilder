>> be quite an entertainingly beauti-
ful mess. There were plenty of aggres-
sively tailored jackets over soft floral
dresses.
Rodarte showed a stunning collec-
tion, influenced by Japanese horror
films, coloured in white, black and
blood red. There were more floaty
dresses, with torn-web detailing on
dresses and tights. The collection
was breath-taking with the porcelain
skinned models providing a stunning

Phi showed a highly constructed,
aggressively sexual collection. With
the tone of the show influenced by
