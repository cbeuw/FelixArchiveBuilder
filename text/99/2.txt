LETTERS TO T H E EDITOR
Room 17,
C & Q.
S i r ,
1 was particularly pleased to read i n the l a s t
issue of 'Felix' that you considered Imperial
College to be a business concern. So many of
your predecessors have insisted that i t i s a
University, where we should take part i n numer-
ous "other" a c t i v i t i e s not shown i n the syllab-
us, that i t i s refreshing to find an Sditor of
Felix^ with sufficient courage to print the truth.
You were wise to point out how irresponsible
i t i s f o r students of I.C. to express i n public
any p o l i t i c a l views that might be the slightest
b i t controversial and I would add that since
we are a l l training to be technologists we are
not expected to take interest i n shaping nat-
ional policy.
F o r t i f i e d by your words I shall continue to
attend at IyC. regularly from 9.30 a.m. to 5.30
p.m. and shun l i k e the plague any a c t i v i t i e s
organised outside these business hours.
Grateful Brown Bagger.

Dear Sir,
The College Staff already have two Senior
C
o
m

o
n Rooms, each with adjoining dining facilities.
One is in the Ayrton Hall; the other is in the Queen's
Gate premises.
Our new UnionBuilding is, in toto, hardly
adequate for the number of students in the oollege,
but I have no objeotion to our Staff having a common
room in that building provided that those who U3e i t
join the Union (£3. 3. 0. Idfe Membership) and also
share i t with students when occasions demand.
Yours faithfully,
Hubert Smith.

S i r ,
It came as a surprise, indeed a shock,
to find that the editor of "Felix" could
l i k e n a college of a University to a busi-
ness concern. Whereby opinions, and l i b -
erty of thought and action, are only to be
enjoyed provided that the result i s a
commercial success.
D i s r a e l i once said " A University should
be a place of l i g h t , of l i b e r t y and of
learning". If the editor is r e a l l y serious
in his argument then I would suggest that he
does not consider I.C. to be worthy of the
status of a University College. He f a l l s i n
completely, i n fact, with Mr. Higson who in
his l e t t e r considers that because money i s
being spent on I.C. we should bow, say
•Thank you' and forget to voice our opinions.
No sirJ This i s not what the attitude of
University students should be; our independ-
ence and thought should be untrammelled toy
consideration of outside influences. It'
seems a pity that the editor of "Felix"
should subscribe to the view that I.C. i s
not af University l e v e l .
Yours f a i t h f u l l y
L. Allen.
C. & G. Onion,
20 th. Nov. 1956
Dear S i r ,
In attempting to answer in part the
l e t t e r from J.L.Sellars in the l a s t issue
of FELIX, I can assure him that the small
representation of Guilds i n this year's
procession was due neither to incompetence
nor apathy.
After l a s t year's excellent Show the
Union was assured that they would again be
inyited to participate, and this year the
City Remembrancer wrote an invitation to
both Guilds and Kings dated July 31st., In-
v i t i n g them to participate. However, both
letters were sent to Kings and, to quote
from his l e t t e r to me: "I was deeply d i s -
tressed to know that as a result of the
maldroitness - for which I take f u l l res-
p o n s i b i l i t y - of the l e t t e r to you being
misdirected " i t was, therefore, no
fault of the Guilds' Committee that earlier
arrangements were not made.
At the beginning of the session, per-
turbed by the lack of an invitation, I was
requested by the Committee to approach the
Authorities. I t then came to l i g h t that this
error had been made, and, furthermore, that
Kings had not seen f i t to forward our i n -
vitation.
At such a comparatively late date i t
was not possible to have more than four
Guildsmen i n the Show. However our repres-
entation was such that the Guilds Crest
appeared on our float - "Aluminium i n Struct-
ures" - and, i n the end, there were six
Guildsmen i n the procession, the two reserves
being found additional places at the rear of
the procession at the l a s t minute.
In conclusion, I again quote from a
l e t t e r from the City Remembrancer: " I am
delighted that you were able to take part
i n the procession and I assure you quite
seriously that your participation year by
year i s much valued. May i t long continue."
The Remembrancer i s also f u l l y aware
of the action of Kings and of the resultant
protest by the College after the Show - I
made sure of that }
Yours sincerely,
J.A. Hobson.

( EDITOR'S NOTE: I am sorry that my remarks
were to some extent misconstrued. A l l
analogies are imperfect. Express your opin-
ions by a l l means - but in such a way as to
clearly give the impression that they are
personal opinions and not the oplnioms of
the College. Most of the witnesses of your
actions are intelligent enough to disting-
uish between the two.)
