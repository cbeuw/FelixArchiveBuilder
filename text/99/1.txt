HUNGARIAN
RELIEF
R E D 0 B 9 3 3
OVER £200 HAS BEES RAISED IN THE COLLEGE XV
RESPONSE TO THE HUNGARIAN REFUGEE APPEALS.
The first money handed over was £27 from the sale
of Felix. The two-day collection, preceded by a pro-
l i f i c advertising campaign, with tricolor lapel emblems
supplied by the Polish Soc, raised £153 - of whioh
.6d was collected in R.C.S.
The proceeds, £36*6.0, of the successful hop
held last Saturday by a aoalition of the International
Relations Club, Polish Soo., and R.C.M. were also
donated to the Sad Cross.
A few members of the College have occupied sane
of their spare time helping with the packing and des-
patch of Clothing and food at the headquarters of
voluntary organisations. This has provided interest-
ing and entertaining work even though the airoumatanoes
are tragic

LODGINGS
" S U R V E Y S B R f f i l K B "
About one reader in four responded to our Lodgings
Survey. The 300 people concerned probably provide a
reasonably typioal sample of the whole, of I.C., although
i t is possible that a higher proportion of those living
near the oollege than those living in remote places did
not trouble to partioipate.
Factual results of the survey are as follows. The
greatest concentration of I.C. students in digs falls
in two areas : between Chiswiok and Ealing and in the
Battersea-Clapham area. 30$ of those responding to the
survey oame from the former area and 2

?
& from the latter.
No regional variation in charges was apparent, except
that those specifying Earl's Court as their area seemed
to pay distinctly more than elsewhere. The average charge
for a single room without food is between thirty shillings
and two pounds (although sane pay up to £3). for bed an<i
breakfast the usual charge is between fifty shillings
and three pounds (though some pay up to £4). Moat students
in digs (65 fo) return to their abodes for an evening meal
and are also provided with|lunch on Sundays. Such people
pay an average of 3 i guineas weekly. It is hoped that
these figures might help/people who are being swindled
to appreciate the fact. It is impossible to pinpoint
individual oases of overcharging from the forms as
payment mu3t depend on the quality of the rooms and
subsidiary facilities provided.
Very few grumble at extra charges for gas, heating
etc, but many do grumble at the money and time wasted
in travelling. One student in five spends more ihan two
hours travelling each day. A further 15$ estimate/their
travelling at l£ hrs and 42fa at about one hour. Since
about two-thirds of these return to their digs for jupper,
it is small wander that so many I.C. student* are rarely
to be seen around the Union in the evenings. The case for
more residential accommodation near oollege is not only
strong, but urgent.
