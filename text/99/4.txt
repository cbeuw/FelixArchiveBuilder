Did you know that i t i s not unusual for
there to be two or three cases of larceny i n
the College or Union PER DAY 1 I f you do not
believe this then ask the I.C.Security O f f i c -
er, J. HENRY. Because, generally speaking,
members of the College are not s u f f i c i e n t l y
concerned with the safety of their property,
I.C. has become the happy-hunting ground of
the petty thief, and Mr. Henry has been work-
ing overtime.
Do you, for example, lock your bicycle
i f you leave one at college during the day ?
You can be a victim of a theft. On Saturday
lOtht: November, two ICWArians l e f t their
hostel rooms unlocked whilst one went for
her breakfast and the other took a bath. On
their return they found a considerable amount
of property had been stolen. On the same day,
a parcel which he knew to contain a 65/-
slide rule awaited J. Chadwick i n the Hostel
rack. He saw i t at 11.50 a.m. but l e f t i t
there because he was going out. On his return
at 4.50 p.m., when he went to c o l l e c t the
parcel, he found that i t had gone. Unfortun-
ately Chadwick did not report the loss to
Mr. Henry u n t i l the following Thursday, and,
at the time of going to press, he has not re-
trieved his property.
Ur. HENRY, i n a special interview with
the Editor (the l a t t e r was identifying one of
his favourite pipes, an alarm clock and his
spare spectacles which had been stolen from
his lab.), said that nearly a l l these i n c i d -
ents with which he had to deal could be pre-
vented i f members of the college were more
cautious. He did not accuse people of being
careless. Prevention i n this case i s certainly
easier and better than cure.

FOR THE RECORD
by the Editor.
Those who are responsible f o r "Felix" are often
faced with a dilemma during the "printing week" between
the going to print and the sale of the paper. When events
of importance occur during those few days, do they rush
brief notice of these into "Stop Press", making space by
sacrificing some article that has already been inserted?
- or do they save the reports so that they appear three
weeks later when their news value has been lost? This
review i s an attempt to solve the problem.
Let us turn f i r s t to Morphy Day. Our report i n the
last issue was a hurriedly prepared one. The omission,"
on the'back page, of the coxes' names from those of the
winning crews was a regretted oversight. The two were
P. Bumby, Mines Morphy, and J . Alexander, Guilds Lowry.
On Tuesday the 13th November Jezebel, the R.C.S.
Fire Engine, was christened. In the photograph that we
were able to s l i p into the last issue, Robin Bray, the
Imperial College Bard, i s seen standing on the engine
reciting an ode to grace the occasion. Jezebel has now
o f f i c i a l l y "taken to the road". We wish her a long and
eventful career.
Dinner i n Hall on the evening of that day provided
another memorable occasion of a different kind. I t was
the f i r s t of these functions to be hald i n the new
Dining Hall and several distinguished guests were present.
One of the most distinguished of those, S i r Alfred
Egerton, a much valued friend of the Union, presented
two beautiful ornate silver candlesticks to the college.
These had been handed down the Egerton family tree for
many years. They represent a really personal g i f t for
whioh everyone i s most grateful.
The last item to be recorded also i s an event whioh
took place on the Tuesday. Keith Miller returned to I.C.
to give a General Studies Lecture:"Training for the
Himalayan Expedition". This was an account of the
Mountaineering Club's training v i s i t to Switzerland
during the summer vacation and was illustrated with some
first-class colour slides. Keith's forthright delivery
and "earthy" language excited the enthusiasm of a large
audience. I t was one of the most successful General
Studies Lectures since the scheme began. (Note f o r
freshers: K.J. M i l l e r was President of C. & G» Union,
last year.)
