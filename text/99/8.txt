Since the last issue of Felix I.C. l s t .
XV have steadily improved and have succeeded
in winning a l l their matches. The excellent
playing record of the other teams has also been
maintained and this augurs well for the strength
of the club i n future years.
Against N.E,C. the college team was obviously
superior from the start and only poor finishing
prevented I.C. from amassing a mammoth score.
After some hard luck with the kicking the match
was eventually won by six tries and a goal to
a try. At home to London Welsh A, the I.C. pack
played with more s p i r i t and were able to give
the backs more than their share of the b a l l .
Seed and Milward at half back who had previously
been playing for the second XV acquitted them-
selves well and after being 6-3 up at half time
I.C. were able to take advantage of a t i r i n g
opposition to f i n i s h winners by 17 pts. to 3.
Last Saturday x.C. played Wadham College,
Oxford when the pack gave a p l e n t i f u l supply
of the b a l l from the scrum and l i n e out. This
provided some much needed practice at giving
and taking a pass for the backs. Eventually
they settled down and following a penalty goal
(Stone) four tries were scored by half time
with the help of some excellent backing up by
the back row of the scrum. In the second half
I.C. f a i l e d to press home their advantage and
although three more t r i e s were scored two penalty
goals were conceded to make the score I.C. 24 pts,
Wadham 6 pts.
The 2nd., B and C XVs. are to be congratul-
ated on having each won five out of six matches
The A XV have only lost two and succeeded i n
defeating their opposition on Saturday with only
13 men on the f i e l d .

Injuries have had an affect on the results
of the club so far this term. In our recent
match against U.C., two University swimmers
were absent and this probably enabled our opp-
onents to gain a narrow victory. However
honour was regained when I.C. won the water-
polo 4-1.
The t r i p to Aylesford Paper Mills proved
successful as far as sport was concerned
though I.C. were beaten 6-3 goals in the water
polo.
The clubs best result to date was i n defeat-
ing Polytechnic by 8-5 goals. This team had
defeated every other team i n the University.
At one stage I.C. were leading by 7-2 goals
and Poly drew back to 7-5 goals before I.C.
scored again.
Two second team games have been played
and unfortunately both lost, Kings II by
3-5 goals and Q.M.C. by 3-5 goals.

On Sunday November 18th. the I.C. Sailing
Club had i t s away match against Southamptoni
University Sailing Club. On arrival at Hambles,
where the match was to take place^nc opponents
nor anybody else could be found. After'some
frantic "phoning the Southampton team was f i n a l l y
found and the match could take place. It was
sailed on the River Hamble, from which the
water was fast disappearing out to sea, leaving
a l o t of dirty-looking mud behind. The wind
was just strong enough to enable one to make
way against the tide and current.
The match was sailed in 'Fleetwinds'.
Instead of the usual two- races with three
boats to each team, three races with two
boats to each team were sailed, as only
four boats were available. I.C. obtained
maximum points i n the two f i r s t races placing
f i r s t and second. However i n the last race
a Southampton boat was f i r s t home, with two
I.C. boats following closely behind. The
f i n a l score was I.C. 37^, Southampton 29^.
The members of the I.C. team were
M.Collyear (Capt.), T.Danbury, C.Ghent,
C.French and Miss E.KranSk.
