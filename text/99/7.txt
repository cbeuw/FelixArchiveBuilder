WINE TASTING
Having settled l a s t year's "financial
i r r e g u l a r i t i e s " to the satisfaction of a l l
concerned, the Society held i t s f i r s t meet-
ing on October 30th., with a record attendance
of over 60, to hear about and taste port.
Numbers dropped o f f a l i t t l e for the
second meeting, on 'Burgundy1
, but were
s t i l l well above l a s t year's attendances.
The meetings are now held on Tuesdays
so that members who wish to can continue a
pleasant evening with Hall Dinner.
Looking forward, the meeting on Dec. 11th.
w i l l be on "Inexpensive tfines" and i t i s
hoped that a large number of the people who
only buy wine for the Christmas f e s t i v i t i e s
w i l l come along and see the choice available.

XI.
2-1
1-1
1-4
1-5
Although the fixture l i s t i s strong, the
l s t . XI should be able to hold i t s own against
other college teams, but unless the forward
line shows more penetration and better combin-
ation, the results w i l l continue to be poor.
Bhatnagor on the right wing gets through a l o t
of work and Clark, Marshall and Rees are steady
in defence.
S O C C E R
The Soccer Club i s now going through a
phase of mixed fortunes. The l s t . XI has
not been at f u l l strength for several weeks
due to unavoidable injuries, and our 2nd.
XI captain D.Baxter suffered- a broken leg
l a s t week i n a league game against L.S.E.
We send him our best wishes and hope that
he w i l l soon be released from hospital to
be with us again.
a l l four teams continue to do very well
in their respective leagues and. i f the present
standard i s kept up they should a l l be at the
top by the end of the seasonx
The results of the friendly matches are
not ao satisfactory and after each game we
walked o f f the f i e l d saying that we should have
have won that game. This i s quite true i n
most cases and i t i s f e l t that i f everyone
could put i n that extra b i t of energy and
s p i r i t for 90 minutes we should have a good
Winning side.

ATHLETIC
CLUB
U.L.A.C. WINTER FIELD EVENTS AND RELAY
COMPETITION, WEDNESDAY 21st. NOVEMBER.
Although the afternoon of the 21st. Nov.
was fortunately fine and clear, i t wa3 rather
cold for athletics. In spite of this there
were some very good performances and I.C.A.C.
can be proud of their achievements. After
winning the 'TJALVE' trophy last year for the
F i e l d Events Competition, I.C. did not disgrace
themselves by coming 3rd. this year with 22 pts.
behind Middlesex Hospital (27 pts) and Guys
Hospital (24 pts).
Only three members of last years team were
competing. M.J.RIckard who gallantly appeared
from semi-retirement and J.D.Lawrence both
jumped 5'6" i n the high jump to gain 2nd. place.
In the long jump Lawrence (19'0") and D.C.Smith
(20'10"), who i s a regular member of the Univer-
s i t y Team i n the H.S.J., gained 2nd. place. In
the Hop,Step,and Jump, Smith jumped 44'7" to set
a new College Record to be the individual
winner. This jump along with Lawrences 40'6"
provided I.C. with l s t . place.
In the throwing event,3 I.C. were represented
entirely by freshers, most of whom were almost
completely unfamiliar with the senior implements..
The performances of our f i e l d events men were
d i s t i n c t l y promising for next season and partic-
ular mention should be made of J.Newman who w i l l
be a great asset to the club i n the future.
Trying his hand for the i i r s t time Newman threw
the hammer 56'2" but was unplaced. A.W.Smith
vaulted 9'0n
to gain 5th. place i n the pole
vault and M.Evans threw a senior javelin for the
f i r s t time 128'6" but being our only competitor
in this event we were unplaced. In the discus
Newman (98'6") and Sharrocks (89'0") were i n
7th. place. The other event in which I.C. scored
2nd. place was the weight where Newman did 35"10"
and Coope 31'0". Unfortunatly Coope w i l l be
overseas i n the summer.
On the track, I.C. were second with 10 pts.
behind U.C.with 16 pts. Our team of M.P.Jarrett
B.Curtis, P.Harrison and D.W.J MacKenzie were
eliminated in the 4x110 yds. relay heats. How-
ever i n the 880x1 milex880 relay, I.C. wOn bj
a convincing margin with K.Wall, J.Evans and
L.C.Locke a l l running very well. In the 220x
220x440yds relay our team of R.Harrison, B.Curtis
and P.M.Rayment, a l l freshers, won their heat
and were t h i r d behind U.C. and London Hosp.
Mention i s to be made of the freshers Curtis
and Rayment. Both ran extemely well and we
loo! forward to seeing them on the track this
summer.
CROSS COUNTRY CLUB
On Sat. Nov. 17th. a very successful 12-a-
side match was held on our course i n Richmond
Park against R.A.F. Cranwell, the l a t t e r team
winning by 92pts. to 118pts.
The following Wed. a weakened f i r s t team
easily triumphed over Q.M.C. by 32pts. to 47.
The f i r s t team suffered their f i r s t defeat last
Saturday, just losing to a strong B r i s t o l Univ.
team :- B r i s t o l 38 pts. I.C. 43 pts. St. Caths.
Coll. Cambridge, 104 pts. This was a very fast
race i n which the f i r s t six runners home a l l
beat 29 mins. for our 5 i mile course.
A noticeable feature of the last four matches
has been the great Improvement in time shown by
several members of the Club. This i s a very good
sign especially as the U.L. Championships are now
only two weeks ahead. It gives good reason to
hope that we shall do at least as well as last
year when our f i r s t team was 2nd. and our second
team 5th.
