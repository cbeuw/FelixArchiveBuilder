Your Instagram faves are awful
The Angry Grad
Columnist
I
t’s a new dawn, it’s a new day,
it’s a new comment piece
from me this week, and I’m
glad you’ve returned for some
fresh rage! For the newbies amonst
you, as the Angry Grad (AG from
now on, because acronyms are hip,
and who has time to speak in full
sentences these days - not me,
I’m too busy looking for a job) I
endeavour to rant about all things
of utmost importance.My topic this
week is far more pressing than the
presidential election, more stressful
than junior doctor contract reform,
and yes, more heart-wrenching than
Zayn leaving 1D. This week, we
discuss why humanity violates my
soul,based on the most liked photos
on Instagram.
At number five, with 2.3
million likes, we have Kylie Jenner
graduating from high school. To
be fair to the kid, I’m suprised
she bloody got there. She’s had a
pretty tough year, and I’m not even
talking about the whole Caitlyn
thing. Balancing that mega pout
with organic chemistry sounds
more stressful than BSc finals, and
combined with the fact that her lip
fillers get more publicity than the
USA’s drone strikes, means that this
lady has had one arduous fucking
year. But hey, she made it, and you
guys rooted for her.
Oh sorry, what did you say 12 year
old girl? Who do you want to be like
when you grow up? Indra Nooyi,
the female CEO of PepsiCo? Edith
Wharton, the writer who exposed
class conflict and social hypocrisy?
Oh, Kylie Jenner, rocking the duck
face on graduation day? Okay, I’m
fully aware that I can’t moan too
much because in a way, this picture
does promote education, especially
for women, but it just pisses me off
that this photo is more appreciated
than snaps of Oprah Winfrey or
Hilary Clinton getting up to their
own ground-breaking antics. The
fact that kids these days, and myself
included here, know more about the
Kardashians than they do about the
Korean crisis makes me despair.
Number four boasts Kimmy
and Kanye playing tonsil tennis on
their wedding day, which received
2.4 million double taps. Well done
world, that amount of appreciation
must have gone straight to Yeezy’s
already hyper-inflated ego, but at
least Kim’s arse can balance it out.
This photo is quite sweet really, but
the miserable douche in me finds
this amount of class unsettling when
it comes from the Kardashian-West
clan. I mean, Kan-ye not?
I want to see Kanye ruining
award shows, or talking about how
he invented leather pants in Latin
times and sold the idea to Virgil.
I mean, if this photo declares that
Kimye are modern day advocates
of matrimony, we must also assume
that the league tables are right, and
UCL is better than Imperial. We
all know that Jay-oncé are the true
I mean,
Kan-ye not?
Back by popular demand, and more bitter than ever, this week
the angry grad is coming for the most liked photos on Instagram.
Evidently,
give a girl
flowers
and she’ll
Shake It
Off.
Feast your eyes on these, the greatest
achievements of our time. Clockwise
from top left, Kenner graduates,
Kardashian-West snoggage, Taylor-
Harris horseplay, Taylor’s humblebrag
and the most liked picture on all of Insta
- Kendall Jenner, who couldn’t even
keep her eyes open for the photo. Photo

king and queen, so why the world is
trying to fuck with the monarchy, I
do not know.
Of course Taylor ruddy Swift
has to feature somewhere, and she
nabs the number three spot with
a totes adorbs snap of her and
her bae, Calvin Harris. With 2.5
million likes, this super candid pic
makes me want to vom. Yes, they
both look fit as fuck, and yes, the
reason I hate it is because I am most
probably jealous. But more likely, I
believe I hate it because this is just
more celebrity relationship fuel
Tay will fire another whiny, chart
topping hit with. I speculate, the
siren in her next ballad will declare
her spinsterhood, seeing as she’s
now exhausted almost every male
in show biz, who she will never ever
ever get back together with.
It’s number two, and FFS here’s
another Tay Tay hit, and to make
things worse, Yeezy is also involved.
The weirdest looking bouquet ever
nabbed a healthy 2.5 million likes,
and was presented to Swifty from
Kanye after she presented the Video
Vanguard Award at the MTV music
awards. Evidently, give a girl some
flowers and she’ll Shake It Off; ‘It’
being any past beef.Kanye may have
some serious Style when it comes to
bouquets, but for god sake Taylor,
stand your ground! You know the
guy was trouble when he walked in,
so don’t encourage him and keep the
Bad Blood between you two. My
life is far more entertaining when
shit listers have feuds.
Drum roll, please, for number
one which goes to Kendall Jenner
sprawled on the floor, with her locks
arranged into hearts. 3.1 million
likes, people. THREE. POINT.
ONE. MILLION. Um, what?
Firstly,thisphotoshould,ifanything,
be reported as it breaks the first and
most important rule of Instagram:
manufactured spontaneity. Maybe
I’m being ignorant, perhaps this
shot conveys some deep meaning
other than promoting Basic Bitch
culture. Maybe she’s replying to the
Black Eyed Peas, answering their
age old question, that the love is
with her. Perhaps this is her way of
encouraging world peace, to fill the
(h)air with love, not war. Or maybe,
most likely of all, she’s trying to nab
a life time supply of those Love
Heart sweets. Who fucking knows.
I cry male tears for Bahar Mustafa
A cis white man on what he thinks about the welfare officer who said #killallwhitemen
Jonathan Masters
Comment Writer
When the media scrolled back through Bahar Mustafa’s tweets, they found a
treasure trove of “stories”.
B
ahar Mustafa is the
Welfare and Diversity
Officer of Goldsmiths,
University of London and
for the second time whilst in her
position she has come under fire for
comments made through twitter.
She previously entered public
consciousness after requesting that
no white men attend a BME non-
binary and women’s meeting, and
then because of various activities on
social media. An image posted to
twitter displayed her mock crying in
front of a sign reading “no white cis-
men pls”and now her tweeting using
the hashtag “#killallwhitemen” has
surfaced once again. The reason she
has resurfaced yet again is that she
has been charged for these actions:
the first being that of sending
a communication conveying a
threatening message between 10th
We deserve
freedom of
speech, no
matter what
that speech
is
The ever
present
spectre
of sexism
still lingers
within our
society
November, 2014 and 31st
May,
2015; and the second is for sending
a grossly offensive message via a
public communication network
between the same dates.Ms Mustafa
is set to appear before magistrates at
Bromley magistrates court on the
5th
November.
Now as you might imagine,as a cis
white male (that is, identifying with
the gender I was asigned at birth) it
is with great trepidation that I write
this article.However,I feel that in all
honesty,although her actions within
the public eye were idiotic, I do not
believe that she should have been
charged for these acts. For me the
crux of the issue comes under the
almost cliché value that we deserve
freedom of speech, no matter what
that speech is. The fact that Bahar
Mustafa is being prosecuted is a
disgusting violation of this, and
although my own personal views are
in direct contention with hers, it is
possible to support her whilst she
undergoes this process.
First of all what must be dealt
with are the views she holds; I
do not agree with her brand of
feminism remotely. I perceive it
as an aggressive, alienating, and,
frankly, insidiously nasty personal
brand. However, it is unacceptable
that she is not allowed to express
these views in whatever way she
sees fit, and with social media being
the quickest way to convey your
views,Twitter would seem like a fair
option.
To put this into balance I think
it’s worth considering the various
other social figures that continually
send communications carrying
threatening and grossly offensive
messages, who continually spew
their verbal faeces all across social
media and in print, who receive no
comeuppance. Of course I’m talking
about the woman who says offensive
things instead of mustering the
energy to come up with anything
vaguely insightful to say: Katie
Hopkins. From refusing to speak
to fat children, to comparing
asylum seekers to cockroaches,
this woman has built a career out
of being grossly offensive, and yet
she seems to become more and
more successful the more vitriol
she emits. On the other side of
the spectrum, the grossly offensive
‘Dapper Laughs’ goes from rape
joke to leery objectification in a
blink of an eye, and yet there is no
form of prosecution towards him
either. I believe that the reason
Bahar Mustafa is being singularly
persecuted is a lack of understanding
and a stubbornness to progress
socially.
The ever present spectre of
sexism still lingers within our
society. Although there is definitely
progression within all sectors, the
idea of new schools of thought
within a movement that too many
perceive as a homogenous idealism
are reflected here. For example, the
change.org petition to have Bahar
Mustafa removed from her position
was started and campaigned for by a
white man at a completely different
university, citing that he worried
“about the future of Britain, free
speech and the ability to be whom
you are”. As a result of her tweets
and the publicity of the whole
episode,Mustafa received numerous
death threats, as well as rape threats,
and the fact that none of these have
been followed up by the police/
been publicised in the media seems
extremely odd.
I would rather see the culture,
perpetuated by the likes of the
aforementioned Dapper Laughs,
targeted more proactively, rather
than this particular brand of
feminism. For some reason he
doesn’t seem to be a priority when
targeting grossly offensive messages.
I feel as though if this hadn’t been
given the publicity it was by the
media, this case would not have
been followed up to the extent that
it has been.
Her case also raises the issue of
twitter as a platform for ideas and
views. If you want to share your
personal philosophy with the world,
why not use a network that can
convey this instantly? Because if
Bahar is a sabbatical officer at Goldsmiths. Can you imagine one of our
sabbs being this controversial?
certain people disagree with your
views it could land you in Bromley
magistrates court. Social media has
brought a new age of connectivity
and broadcasting content has almost
accidentally ushered in an ominous
cloud of censorship, ready to strike
down those that hold risky looking
views, leading to a general anxiety
over whether or not we should ever
tweet an opinion.
The final point I want to make
is this: a platform for sharing
ideas does not give credence or
incitement to those deemed ‘grossly
offensive’, moreover it provides a
bigger platform to ridicule, discuss,
and even perhaps understand them,
which is far more than sending
someone to court over a tweet can
ever do.
