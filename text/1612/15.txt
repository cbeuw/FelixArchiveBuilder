A disgrace of epic proportions
A
s Head of Year 11,
Diane is meant to be
implementing the new
‘Healthy Relationships’
curriculum.But then Freddie arrives.
She hasn’t seen him since that night
six years earlier when he was fifteen.
She thinks he took advantage of
her. He thinks she groomed him for
months. But neither is sure.
Neverbeforehasaworkofartmade
me as angry, disgusted and upset as
Consensual. An utterly disgraceful
depiction of young people and
sexual assault, the National Youth
Theatre (NYT) should be appalled
and ashamed at this production.
Pushing the boundaries of poor
taste and acceptable behaviour, this
is miles past anything I have ever
seen on stage.
I joined the NYT in 2013 and my
experience with them was one of
the most rewarding and enjoyable
times in my life. The primary
ambassador for young theatre in
Britain, NYT represents thousands
of aspiring actors and many of the
stage’s greatest names have passed
through their doors.
From their vast numbers, sixteen
members are chosen each year to
take part in the NYT Rep company,
a free of charge training scheme
which ends in a series of west
end performances. Whether this
excuses a lack of professionalism
in Consensual is debatable, but
the fact that these hugely talented
young people are forced to perform
this painfully stereotyped, rancid
material is a real tragedy. I was
proud to be a member of NYT – this
production leaves me disappointed
and embarrassed.
Written by the award winning
Evan Placey, Consensual claims
to be an explosive, thought-
provoking piece about sexual
consent, but it’s not. This play
systematically trivialises rape and
depicts the average teenager as
rude, uncontrollable and stupid.
The premise isn’t necessarily
unworkable and I am in no way
averse to controversial theatre, but
the execution is ethically all over the
place. Jokes are thrown in left right
and centre and it seems impossible
for any character, not just the kids,
to go two minutes without making
some obnoxious, unnecessary
remark for comic effect. What’s
funny about rape? Nothing – but
somehow the audience can’t stop
laughing.
To end the play, in a decision
that continues to baffle me, Diane
and Freddie are shown having sex
on stage. Whether in good taste or
not, the production continues to
invite laughter to an image which
is frankly horrifying. I do not doubt
that Placey had the best intentions
when writing this play, but I fear
for the victim of sexual assault who
witnesses this work.
There are glaring inconsistencies
running throughout the script and
character development is completely
unbelievable. Classic moments of
NYT ensemble work and a number
of scene changes are accompanied
by the year 11 class rapping are
to an extent impressive, but to
which purpose I do not know. The
direction at the start of the second
half shows some potential, but
most moments feel forced and the
actions of multiple characters are
unacceptable and unjustified. It is
a real shame because I can honestly
say that the performance of Lauren
Lyle as Diane is outstanding and
the rest of the cast work well with
the material they are given, but they
can in no way redeem the travesty
which is Consensual.
In his programme notes, Placey
mentions how he wanted to
explore the complexity behind a
teacher/student relationship and I
understand why. As wrong as the act
is, nothing is ever black and white
Max Falkenberg
Arts Editor
and no question about relationships
is ever simple. But execution is
everything and Consensual lacked it
all.The approach this play has taken
is horrific, and no good intentions
can excuse the end result. With
no moral path, no boundaries
and no respect, Consensual is an
embarrassment.
Consensual is on at the Ambassador’s
Theatre until December

British Museum appoints new Director
D
r Hartwig Fischer has
been appointed the new
director of the British
Museum, he replaces
Neil MacGregor, who stepped
down at the end of September.
Dr Fischer is the first non-British
director of the museum since the
19th
century.
Fischer may be most familiar to
British audiences as the co-curator
of the Kadinsky exhibition at the
Tate Modern in 2006. However,
most of his career has taken place in
his native Germany.
Until his appointment at the
British Museum, he was director of
the Staatliche Kunstsammlungen
(State Art Collection) in Dresden,
and previously the Folkswang
Museum in Basel. This will have
given him the experience of looking
after historic priceless collections,
but being at the helm of the
British Museum will quite another
eperience.
Fischer will have big shoes to fill
at his new role. MacGregor has
presided over something of a golden
age in the museum’s history. The
British Museum has become one of
the world’s most visited museums,
surpassed only by the Louvre; it
welcomed 6.7 million people visited
in 2014.
The History of the World in 100
Objects exhibition will be touring
China as part of the a soft power
approach to improving relations
with the economic giant.
Macgregor was also instrumental
in resisting the return of antiquities,
particularly the Parthenon marbles.
These foreign antiquities form the
bedrock of the British Museum’s
collection, their would be disastrous
to the organisation.
Fischer will have to find new
ways to maintain this success. His
expertise is in 20th
century art;

director since 19th Century

It’s early days
for this young
club but I
expect drastic
improvement
pretty quickly
MacGregor’s was in classical art,
it will be interesting to see how
this difference manifests in their
approaches to setting the direction
for the future of the British
Museum.
The best in budget stand-up
Y
oung, fun and edgy, The
Comedy Tree’s rebirth
in Hammersmith shows
flashes of brilliance at an
unrivalled price.
Having left their Putney venue
after thirteen years, The Comedy
Tree still needs to find its feet but
inklings of long term potential are
there. While the laughs will always
be the focus of a good comedy club,
the buzz of the best venues offer
an experience second tier clubs
can’t match. The Comedy Tree has
a sharp young line-up, but three
weeks into their new venue,the club
hasn’t found its groove. The space is
flash but the room feels a little large
for an under filled club.Would I just
chill in a room like this? Probably
not. Of course this will improve
as The Comedy Tree solidifies its
crowd and learns how best to use its
space but they aren’t there yet.
With a changing line-up, each
week will of course vary, but the acts
I saw suggest a knack for booking
quality up-and-coming young
comedians. With the eighteen
year-old Tom Lucy standing
out as a future star, the line-up
was rounded off by newcomers
Francis Foster, George Lewis, and
headliner Gordon Southern. Foster
and Lewis both show signs of their
inexperience but the laughs are
frequent and well judged.
Foster is funny but can feel
quite simple and Lewis has an
extraordinary knack for one liners
but lacks the filler needed for a full
set. Southern is a wicked wordsmith
with an entertaining mix of comic
rap and dirty charm. His pedigree
is obvious and he holds himself
with confidence. With a sharp,
on the money set, Southern is
an entertaining comedian who’s
not too far from being fantastic.
Occasionally his material drags a
Max Falkenberg
Arts Editor
little and his pace drops towards
the end, but the overall result is
impressive.
Without going into detail, I
must commend Tom Lucy for an
exemplary set by a young comedian.
With perfect timing and a superbly
clever progression, Lucy has an
almost unrivalled ability to lure his
audience into a laugh and subvert
our expectations – I’d be amazed if
we don’t see a lot more of him in the
years to come.
The lasting impression from The
Comedy Tree is somewhat mixed.
It‘s early days for this young club but
I expect drastic improvement pretty
quickly. The bar is expensive, so any
trip requires a substantial pre-drink,
but the ticket price is as good as it
gets. Realistically,The Comedy Tree
isn’t something I’d make a date out
of, but if you’re free on a Thursday,
there aren’t many better things to do.
