H
i there all, and welcome
to your brand new
FELIX. What d’you
think? Wait, don’t tell
me, I can’t hear you.
What a week we’ve had.It was our
first legit issue after the Freshers’
special, which we managed to put
in almost every hall bedroom. This
involved a handful of us minibussing
it around London and throwing
copies out of the window like in the
beginning of a film set in American
suburbia. Well, not quite, we were
helped by loads of hall seniors,
who we have hella love for. At one
point I was taking copies of FELIX
between Xenia in Waterloo and
Parsons House at Charing Cross
Hospital on the tube, which made
for very bizarre travelling. Everyone
thought I was some sort of Evening
Standard distributor gone rogue,
so no one would give up their seat

for me, even though 100 copies of
FELIX are obviously much heavier
than say, a baby.
As always, it’s not too late to get
involved with FELIX this year.
Whether you’re a newb to Imperial,
or just hadn’t got round to writing
for us yet, drop felix@imperial.ac.uk
a message saying hello. Even
better, if you want to meet section
editors, generally quiz us and have
some pizza while you’re at it, come
along to our social. It’s in our
shiny new newspaper office down
in the basement of West Beit on
Monday 12th
at 5pm(ish). There
are no hierarchies to infiltrate since
most of our editorial team are new
this year, and we’ll offer you all the
training you might want, so do drop
by. We’re well friendly. Well, I am.
Also, as a final reminder, don’t
forget to use and abuse us. If you
have a complaint, tell us. If you
think we’re missing something,
point it out, and most importantly,
if news is happening in front of
your eyes, take a picture and let us
know, via Twitter (@feliximperial),
Facebook or the good old fashioned
email above. Don’t be a stranger!
