Mountains May Depart
Dir: Jia Zhangke. Script: Jia

Zhang Yi, Llang Jingdong. 126
minutes.
I
n the opening scene of
Mountains May Depart, a
group of young Chinese people
dance to the Pet Shop Boys’
hit 1993 single Go West. The year is
1999, and a sense of optimism is in
the air, as China heads into a new
millennium; director Jia Zhangke’s
eighth feature documents the
changes over the next 26 years, as
James White
Dir: Josh Mond. Script: Josh Mond.
Starring: Christopher Abbott,
Cynthia Nixon. 85 minutes.
T
he hype surrounding
Josh Mond’s debut
feature, James White,
largely stems from the
fact that this is the final member
of production collective Borderline
Films – responsible for Martha
Marcy May Marlene and Simon
Killer – to step into the driver’s seat.
However, there is much more to be
excited about here, as James White
proves to be a solid, confident piece
of filmmaking.
The titular character is a hard-
drinking, fast-living New Yorker,
played by Christopher Abbott of
Girls fame, whose life is brought
to a halt, first by the death of
his estranged father, then by his
mother’s development of terminal
cancer. Abbott manages a tricky
balancing act: creating one of the
most self-centred characters I have
seen on screen, only to turn things
around in the closing half-hour
with some emotionally devastating
scenes.
His performance is supported
by a nuanced turn from Cynthia
Dixon as his mother, who manages
to convey the agony of cancer with
great physicality.
Mond’s years in the producing seat
has clearly equipped him well for
this feature, and his direction style
is certainly assertive, with Abbott’s
face in extreme close-up for much
of the film, creating a disconcerting
lack of distance between him and
the audience. James White is a
film that is difficult to enjoy, but
impossible not to admire.
China follows the Pet Shop Boys’
advice, hurtling into a new world
of state-controlled capitalism at the
emotional expense of its citizens.
Split into three parts – 1999,2014,
and 2025 – we follow the life of
Tao, a woman from Zhangke’s own
hometown, Fenyang, whose path is
shaped by China’s economic destiny.
In 1999 she spurns Liangzi (Liang
Jingdon), a coal miner, in favour of
the wealthier entrepreneur Zhang
(Zhang Yi), and has a son called
Dollar, a mark of the influence of
Western consumerism.
By 2014 Tao has divorced, and
meets up with her son one last time
before he emigrates to Australia
with his father, now a powerful
magnate.
Finally, the action jumps forward
to 2025,where Dollar – having lived
in Australia for most of his adult
Grandma
Dir: Paul Weitz. Script: Paul Weitz.
Starring: Lily Tomlin, Julia Garner,
Marcia Gay Harden, Laverne Cox.
80 minutes.
T
hose who are rightly
worried about the
number of current films
failing the Bechdel
Test (are there two named female
characters who talk to each other
about something other than a
man?) will take solace in the release
of Grandma. A breezy comedy
from writer/director Paul Weitz,
Grandma passes within the first
minute, as aging lesbian poet Elle
(Lily Tomlin) breaks up with her
much younger girlfriend Olivia
(Marcia Gay Harden), calling
their relationship ‘just a footnote’
in the tale of her life. While such
callousness seems be par for the
course with Elle,it is understandable
in context: she is still reeling from
the recent death of her long-term
partner.
The plot’s drive is introduced in the
form of granddaughter Sage (rising
star Julia Garner), who comes to
Elle asking to borrow money for an
abortion.What follows is a road-trip
around friends and acquaintances,
calling in old favours in return for
cold cash, that generally follows the
same route that similar odd-couple
comedies have furrowed in the past.
While the film has a light,
convivial atmosphere – aided
by a naturalistic palate from
cinematographer Tobius Datum –
the subjects discussed are a different
matter: abortion, sexuality, and grief
all form key motifs. This depth, and
the astonishing performance from
Tomlin, makes this film more than
the sum of its parts.

Remainder
Dir: Omer Fast. Script: Omer Fast.
Starring: Tom Sturridge, Cush
Jumbo, Ed Speleers, Arsher Ali. 97
minutes.
T
here are perhaps many
labels that you can place
on Omer Fast’s first
feature film, Remainder:
haunting; unnerving; perhaps, if
you’re feeling dispirited: pretentious.
But one thing you definitely cannot
call it is derivative.
Based on the novel by Tom
McCarthy – who, incidentally, has
been nominated for this year’s Man
Booker Prize – Remainder is a dark,
twisting tale, involving a young man
who is crushed by an object falling
from the sky. After an uncertain
period of time, he returns to the
world, without his memories, but
millions of pounds richer thanks
to the settlement case. As old
memories begin to filter through,
the man becomes obsessed with
recreating the visions he believes
hold the key to unlocking the past.
Cats tied to rooftops, old women
frying liver, faceless stand-ins,
whose role is to inhabit rather than
express an idea. These all feature in
his scheme. As the film progresses
we seem to get closer to the truth,
but the goalposts keep on being
moved, and really nothing in this
world is certain.
Tom Sturridge is brilliantly
brooding as the unnamed man, and
with his prominent jawline and
heavy intonation, reminded me of
Iwan Rheon’s character in the TV
series Misfits. The comparisons do
not stop there: the entire production
seems to be imbued with the
familiar-yet-unfamiliar spirit that
Channel 4 productions manage
to capture so well (think Misfits,
Utopia, or Black Mirror). Fast takes
a look at the decay that lurks at the
heart of modern society, taking it
apart with scalpel-like precision.
The script, with its heavy, evocative
language, seemed to be perhaps
better suited to the stage, but it
works nevertheless.
Where Remainder really stands
out is in Fast’s unique vision; a
contemporary artist by trade, his
life – has forgotten Chinese, and
has problems communicating with
his traditionalist father, while Tao
languishes alone in Fenyang.
A thoughtful, evocative mediation
on the passing of time and the nature
of change, Mountains May Depart
is built around the emotional core
provided by long-time collaborator
Zhao Tao, whose performance of
Tao is wonderfully nuanced. While
lacking the Tarintino-esque energy
of his last film, A Touch of Sin, and
suffering from a sudden change of
tone in the last section (which can
perhaps be explained by the fact
that it is mostly in English, leading
to clunky dialogue that feels much
less naturalistic than the previous
sections), Mountains May Depart
is a clever, exploration of the effect
of Westernisation on China, seen
through the microcosm of a single
woman’s life. Now entering his
middle age,Zhangke has clearly lost
none of the energy that directed his
early works, and remains probably
the most important Chinese
filmmaker working today.
Mountains
May Depart
shows us that
Jia Zhangke
remains one
of the most
important
Chinese
filmmakers of
our time
work involves rearranging existing
videos into new works of visual art.
This practice has clearly played
into this feature, allowing Fast
to convey the film in a new visual
language – a similar case can be seen
with other directors who have made
the move from contemporary art,
such as Clio Barnard, or Miranda
July.
Like it or loathe it, Remainder
is certainly a film that provides
questions to ponder on, for which
perhaps there are no answers. Call it
pretentious if you will, but I think it
was sublime.

Suffragette: Oscar Bait?
Suffragette
Dir: Sarah Gavron. Script: Abi
Morgan. Starring: Carey Mulligan,
Helena Bonham Carter, Meryl
Streep, Ben Wishaw. 106 minutes.
Fred Fyles
Film Editor
T
o call Suffragette ‘Oscar
Bait’ would probably be
a tad unfair. The term
conjures up all kinds
of negative imagery: a mawkish,
overbearing soundtrack that tugs
at the heartstrings; a star-studded
cast in which someone pretends to
have a disability; Forrest Gump. But
if we look at the elements that make
up director Sarah Gavron’s latest
feature, it is difficult to come to any
other conclusion.
A historical drama that focuses
on the history of the women’s
suffrage movement in the UK at
its height, Suffragette manages to
conjure up the theme of the march
of progress coming up against the
ideas of the past. Beginning with
steamy shots of a cramped laundry,
whose conditions resemble those
of Milton’s dark satanic mills, we
are introduced to Maud (Carey
Mulligan), whose short life has
largely been spent washing others’
clothes, to the detriment of her
health. While her home life is
happy – with Ben Wishaw playing
her initially-loving husband, Sonny
– she seems to yearn for something
more. Finding a new life within the
Women’s Social and Political Union
(WSPU), she begins to take part in
civil disobedience and violence.
While there was concern from the
initial trailer that hearing Mulligan
give her best attempt at an East
End accent would be toe-curlingly
embarrassing, her performance is
actually quite believable. Her time
on stage – recently starring in a
revival of Skylight – has clearly paid
off, and her acting style is incredibly
naturalistic. It is also interesting to
see how physical she has become as
an actor, imbuing her character with
a series of jerky movements, which
seem to develop into psychological
tics as the strain the establishment
places on her increases.
Mulligan’s performance is
supported by a strong cast of
women: Helena Bonham Carter
plays Edith, the well-educated
chemist whose shop becomes
a nexus for the movement, and
international treasure Meryl Streep
stars as the movement’s leader,
Emmeline Pankhurst. Streep’s
role in the film is a small one, but
her natural charisma means every
second counts. Anne-Marie Duff’s
character of Violet, the fellow
laundry worker who turns Maud
onto the movement, is a highlight,
forming a solid pillar upon which
the film rests.
The script,penned by Abi Morgan,
who is fast becoming a British
institution, manages to breathe
life into the story, creating largely-
believable characters, only some of
whom – such as Emily Wilding
Davison (Natalie Press) – were real-
life figures, the rest standing more
for concepts of femininity.However,
it would be an achievement to make
a limpid script, given the fascinating
subject matter, and there is a slight
sense of déjà vu with the pacing of
the film. In the past couple of years
we have seen a formula developed
for period pieces that centre a
‘controversial-at-the-time’ issue,
and Suffragette seems to follow it
to the letter: we are introduced
to the action through an initially
reticent figure with whom we can
sympathise (see: Pride); the film
works its way to an emotional and
physical climax that, with the gift of
hindsight, we know is coming (see:
The King’s Speech); and before the
credits roll we are given a glimpse
of real-life news footage of the era
(see: Selma). That’s not to say that
this is a bad thing, or that the film
doesn’t work, just that we seem to
be heading down well-trodden
territory.
The film avoids falling into the
typical costume drama trap of
feeling staid, thanks largely to
Gavron’s direction; up to four
handheld cameras were used at one
time, creating an atmosphere that
never seems dour,but instead rightly
holds up the work of the Suffragettes
as vital, vibrant, and fresh. The
colour palate of the film, based on
the movement’s now-iconic purple,
white and green flag, is noticeable,
but never overpowering.
While the film’s focus on the
working-class heart of the suffrage
movement is very welcome, the
lack of women of colour strikes a
discordant note, especially when
we know that South Asian women
in particular did contribute to the
pressure on government. I am sure
that in the coming weeks there
will be a deluge of thinkpieces on
this issue, so I will not dwell on it
any longer. Suffice to say: if you’re
looking for BME women, they ain’t
there.
Suffragette is an instinctively
appealing film to watch. By and
large, the audience is already on
the characters’ side, seeing universal
suffrage as a sacred right (although,
the statistics at the end of the film
showing the dates that different
countries adopted this policy would
indicate otherwise); right from
the get-go, we can empathise with
Maud, a character for whom the
forces of patriarchy have been near-
literally crippling. Hit then with
a series of excellent performances,
and a visit from Streep herself (by
now the closest thing cinema has
to Jesus), and we have little choice
but to stay glued to our seats. On
reflection, however, it is possible to
notice things that don’t sit right:
the formulaic story arcs, the way
characters stand more for ideas than
people, and the oversimplification
of the background characters (we
already know that the laundry
owner is evil, do we really need to
see him sexually assault a child for
the message to be clear?) – these all
add up to a film that is solid, and,
while not staid, definitely imbued
with a sense of worthiness. It will
win a lot of Oscars.
