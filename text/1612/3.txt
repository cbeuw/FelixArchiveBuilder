Imperial supercomputer is named ‘Helen’
T
he winning entry in a
competition to name
one of Imperial’s
supercomputers has been
announced, and it’s Helen.
Helen Kemp Porter joined
Imperial’s Biochemistrydepartment
in 1959, making her the first female
professor at Imperial.This was a full
ten years after Oxford and twenty
after Cambridge appointed their
first female professors. If Imperial
feels male dominated now, imagine
what it was like then.
Porter was already a fellow of the
Royal Society when she got the
job. The research group she headed
up at Imperial was one of the first
few to use chromatography to study
metabolism in plants.
An analyst from the IT
department, Kay Barrett, won the
competition.On choosing the name,
she said that Helen “really stood
out” and that “as a woman working
in the technology sector, I thought
it was important to recognise the
contribution women have made to
science throughout history”.
The supercomputer’s rebrand
coincides with its recent upgrade.
Opening up the naming process to
thecollegecommunityhasreminded
everyone that Imperial does in fact
have several supercomputers, and
that they are available to Imperial
academics to test their models
before asking for time with other
more powerful computers.
The supercomputer, formerly
known as CX2, has just been given
more memory,with the competition
being launched in celebration.
This high powered computer is
used to generate big data, analyse
multifaceted models and predict the
outcomes of complex mechanical,
medical and structural set ups.

Dr Sherman
was the first
Briton in
space, and
remains the
only one
Real life astronaut to join Imperial staff
T
his week, Imperial
announced the
appointment of a new
Operations Manager
in the Chemistry department, who
happens to have been to space.
In the late 80s,Dr Helen Sherman
was working for the confectionary
company, Mars, when she heard a
radio advert appealing for wannabe
space explorers. By 1991, she was
aboard the Mir space station,
conducting experiments with
Russian cosmonauts.
Dr Sherman was the first
Briton in space, and remains the
only one, since all other British
astronauts have had to change their
citizenship, and make the trip under
the American flag. She is likely to
remain the only British woman
to do so for a while longer, since
the European Space Agency has
chosen a male helicopter test pilot
as the next British recruit to be
trained as an astronaut.
Now Dr Sharman will be
dealing with chemists at Imperial.
Although the role is managerial,
she told college in an interview on
their website that, “the fact that I
enjoy chemistry means I just feel
right having a home in a chemistry
department”.
After returning from space,
Sharman focussed on science
outreach, doing talks on her
experiences of space travel. She
was recently awarded a science
outreach prize from the British
Science Association. With David
Nutt, the Imperial academic sacked
as a government advisor for saying
that ecstacy was less dangerous than
riding a horse, returning to do a
Horizons lecture, could Imperial
be banking on their new resident
astronaut to do a few talks herself?
The trip that blasted Dr Sharman
to fame, and space, was a joint
venture by British companies and
the Soviet government. When
British firms didn’t have the
finances to complete the project,
and the British government would
not invest, Russia made up the rest
of the money.
Dr Sharman has spoken out on
the British government’s reluctance
to spend on space flight, saying that
there are long term gains. In a 2009
interview with The Telegraph, she
said that space flight gives people
“the feeling that Britain is not
getting left behind when it comes to
technology and worldwide status”.
This sounds pretty Imperial to us.

company and then going on to be
