Chvrches - Every Open Eye
I
nternet trolls and misogynistic
abvse seem to have done little
to slow the rapid ascendency
of the scottish electronic trio.
Having tovred the world,they retvrn
with their sophomore albvm which
continves where 2013’s The Bones of
What You Believe left off - a record
that pvshed synth-pop back into the
mainstream in spectacvlar fashion.
Early single ‘Leave a Trace’
promised a slight departvre from
endlessly bombastic natvre of the
band’s debvt, taking a more delicate
approach to song making whilst still
conserving the catchy hooks that
have made them so popvlar. There’s
an anger here that is immediately
obviovs as she takes aim at a
former lover, “You talk far too
mvch / For someone so vnkind.”
Vnfortvnately, mvch of this is
lost on the rest of the albvm; tracks
‘Keep You On My Side’, ‘Empty
Threat’, ‘Playing Dead’ and ‘Bury It’
feel like filler and their attempts at
being anthemic fall flat. Opening
track ‘Never Ending Circles’ is
vnderwhelming with a bvild-vp
that never resolves. ‘Make Them
Gold’ delivers a more empowering
message in “We will take the best

that so often hides its flaws vnder
a shimmering layer of synths.
‘Clearest Blue’ is easily the star
of the show. Whilst there’s initially
a feeling of hopelessness “Tied,
to the shifting ground”, when the
drop finally happens a sense of
evphoria takes hold as “You’ll meet
me halfway” evolves into “Will you
meet me more than halfway?”
‘High Enough to Carry Over’
and ‘Down Side of Me’ take a more
laid-back approach with the former
marking Martin Doherty’s retvrn to
vocals bvt vltimately both feel ovt of
place and vninspired. The dreamy
ambient synths on ‘Afterglow’, the
closing track, give hope to the fvtvre
sovnd of Chvrches. It’s an evolvtion
that is massively welcome, althovgh
one that comes far too late.
Whilst Every Open Eye is more
polished than its predecessor, it
relies far too heavily on the formvla
they established two years ago - a
formvla that by the albvm’s end feels
tired and hollow.As others encroach

eafheaven’s Sunbather
was one of 2013’s
defining records and an
album that black metal
fans loved to hate. It combined
black metal and shoegaze (call it
blackgaze if you wish) in a way few
had dared to do before, introducing
a once inaccessible genre to
thousands of new listeners.
The cover of New Bermuda
stands out in stark contrast to its
predecessor; gone is the warm pink
of Sunbather now replaced by dark
uneven strokes. Whilst the album
feels angrier and more abrasive,
the overall structures and sounds
have changed very little. Thrashing
black metal always seamlessly
transitions to the uplifting melodies
that Deafheaven are famous for.
‘Brought to the Water’ begins
with a growling rumble as church
bells ring. Angry guitars and noisy
drums permeate the air. It’s black
metal at its finest but what follows is
arguably the record’s finest moment.
The cinematic chord progressions
here laced with George Clarke’s
inaudible screams exceed even the
greatest moments of ‘Dream House’
on their previous record. As before
you’ll need a lyric sheet to discern
Clarke’s screeching but when you
do everything begins to make
sense - “A multiverse of fuchsia /
And violet surrenders to blackness
now” echoes the epic struggle
between the darkness of black metal
and the deep moody moments
of beauty that intersperse it.
The harsh trash metal of ‘Luna’
opens up into dreamy guitars and
there are rare moments where you
can just about understand Clarke’s
screamsashedescribesanightmarish
suburbia “There is no glamour /
Only the mirage of water ascending
from the asphalt …Sitting quietly in
scorching reimagined suburbia”.
‘Baby Blue’ almost leaves death
metal behind with grungy solos
layered over throbbing guitars.
The visceral ‘Come Back’ provides
some of the album’s most intense
moments contrasted with its
most calm. Its riffs will put you
in a trance before it descends into
lush twangy guitars. They finish
with ‘Gifts for the Earth’, a song
unlike anything they’ve released
before with power chords blending
seamlessly into a beautiful piano,
guitar and tambourine outro.
With New Bermuda, Deafheaven
almost match the greatness
of Sunbather. They’ve crafted
something that’s a little darker
and a little less shoegazing
whilst still delivering so many of
their signature melodic highs.
