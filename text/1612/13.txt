Monologue for an Onion
I don’t mean to make you cry.
I mean nothing, but this has not kept you
From peeling away my body, layer by layer,
The tears clouding your eyes as the table fills
With husks, cut flesh, all the debris of pursuit.
Poor deluded human: you seek my heart.
Hunt all you want. Beneath each skin of mine
Lies another skin: I am pure onion – pure union
Of outside and in, surface and secret core.
Look at you, chopping and weeping. Idiot.
Is this the way you go through life, your mind
A stopless knife, driven by your fantasy of truth,
Of lasting union – slashing away skin after skin
From things, ruin and tears your only signs
Of progress? Enough is enough.
You must not grieve that the world is glimpsed
Through veils. How else can it be seen?
How will you rip away the veil of the eye, the veil
That you are, you who want to grasp the heart
Of things, hungry to know where meaning
Lies. Taste what you hold in your hands: onion juice,
Yellow peels, my stinging shreds. You are the one
In pieces. Whatever you meant to love, in meaning to
You changed yourself: you are not who you are,
Your soul cut moment to moment by a blade
Of fresh desire, the ground sown with abandoned skins.
And at your inmost circle, what? A core that is
Not one. Poor fool, you are divided at the heart,
Lost in its maze of chambers, blood, and love,
A heart that will one day beat you to death.
                                                                              Suji Kwock Kim
Arts & Society
Greetings again! It’s been a
frantic week since the start of
freshers and we’re sure you’ve all
had the chance to get properly
trashed. Now that you’re
hungover and have nothing
better to do, maybe it’s time to
start indulging in our wonderful
Arts Section!
If you’ve already seen all
the cracking shows that we
recommended last week and
are hungry for more, fret not!
This week we’re at it again and
have another six shows for you
from the list we forgot about last
week.
It was great meeting many of
you at Freshers’ Fair on Tuesday,
but you can’t back out now. We
received a tremendous number
of sign ups and we hope every
single one of you will find the
time to write for us at least once
this zear. Yeah you’re all busy,
we know that, but we promise
you, nothing beats the Arts in
London!
This week, we explore the
relationship between society
and artistic expression - how
far should we go to insist on
freedom of expression, and how
much censorship should be
permissible, if at all?
Art can serve as a force for
positive change in society, often
bringing across issues in a more
effective way. Here we introduce
the Poetry Cafe and its activities,
in particular the Exiled Lit Cafe
of migrant poetry.
We also feature an interview
with Tritan Sharps, the
incredible artistic director of
dreamthinkspeak. Of course
we’re also proud to present our
most recent 1 star review this
week, so if you’re up for a good
scathing, turn the page.
With the plethora of shows
around London,we expect these
pages to only get busier. We
hope the reviews we publish
each week will help you make
wiser choices regarding your
entertainment, and perhaps
provide you with some
entertainment in themselves. If
they don’t, there’s always a poem
about onions as an alernative.
