Nobel Prize winners for 2015 announced
T
he Nobel Laureates
who will receive the
2015 Nobel Prizes in
Physics, Chemistry
and Physiology or Medicine were
revealed this week. The annual
awards are widely regarded as the
most prestigious in their respective
fields.
Recipients receive a gold medal
and diploma; each prize is also
worth £631,000 which is split evenly
between the winners if several
share the award. The Laureates
often donate their prize money to
scientific, cultural and humanitarian
causes.
The prizes were established in
1895 by Swedish inventor Alfred
Nobel, who bequeathed his fortune

A
nother pioneer in the
field of parasitic disease
will receive the second
half of the 2015 Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
Chinese scientist Youyou Tu was
the discoverer of highly effective
malaria treatment Artemisinin.
Tu was working on a secret
military project during the
Cultural Revolution in China
when she discovered the drug.
Previous malaria treatments such
as chloroquine had become less
effective over time as malaria
parasites had developed resistance
to them.
Artemisinin works by blocking
the cycle through which malaria
parasites propagate, clearing them
from the infected patient’s blood.
Tu headed up a team assigned to
“project 523”, searching through
over 2000 ancient Chinese remedies
to try and find a cure for the
devastating disease.
Eventually a recipe entitled
“Emergency Prescriptions Kept
Up One’s Sleeve”, written more
than 1600 years ago, was found
and tested. It described the
preparation in water of Artemisia
annua, commonly known as sweet
wormwood.
Tu’s research determined the
active ingredient which was highly
effective at treating the disease.
Initial tests in 21 humans with one
of two forms of malaria found that
the extract was effective in wiping
out both types of parasite.
Professor Tu described her prize-
winning discovery as “a true gift
from old Chinese medicine”. In an
interview after the announcement
she said: “I was a little bit surprised,
but not really …because [this prize]
is not an honour just for me, but an
honour for all Chinese scientists”.
This is the first time in history
that the Nobel Prize in Physiology

awarding of the 2015
Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine, with one half jointly
going to Irish parasitologist
William C. Campbell and Japanese
microbiologist Satoshi Ōmura.
The pair were behind the discovery
of new drug Avermectin, derivatives
of which have proven to be effective
treatments for a number of diseases
caused by roundworm parasites.
Their work has radically lowered the
incidence of River Blindness and
Lymphatic Filariasis.
Combined, these two diseases
affect more than 100 million people
worldwide. Those who contract
Lymphatic Filariasis can suffer from
disabling swelling, in some cases
including elephantiasis.
Satoshi Ōmura made an initial
breakthrough after studying soil
samples, growing bacteria that were
found to produce anti-microbial
compounds. William Campbell
then found that a particular strain,
Streptomyces avermitilis, was
particularly effective against the

n a second announcement, the
Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences awarded the Nobel
Prize in Chemistry for 2015
to Tomas Lindahl, Paul Modrich
and Aziz Sancar for their work in
mapping how cells repair damaged
DNA, safeguarding the genetic
information.
Together the three scientists
provided fundamental knowledge
of how living cells function, which
is now used in a number of fields
including the development of new
cancer treatments.
Human cells divide billions of
times from the time of conception
to adulthood, each time unravelling
and recreating the strands of
DNA within their nucleus. It was
long considered incredible that
the genetic information could be
duplicated so accurately each time.
“From a chemical perspective,
this ought to be impossible,” the
Nobel committee stated at the
prize announcement. “All chemical
processes are prone to random
errors. Additionally, your DNA
is subjected on a daily basis to
damaging radiation and reactive
molecules.
“In fact, you ought to have been a
chemical chaos long before you even
developed into a foetus,”they added.
The trio of scientists who were
awarded this year’s Nobel Prize in
Chemistry resolved this conundrum
by figuring out how cells are able to
repair the inevitable mutations that
occur during DNA synthesis.
It was Tomas Lindahl who first
demonstrated in the 1970s that the
rate of decay of DNA molecules was
great enough that it ought to make
the development of life on Earth
impossible. He went on to discover
a piece of molecular machinery
called base excision repair, which
continuously counteracts the
collapse of DNA.
Aziz Sancar went on to map
another mechanism, nucleotide
excision repair, which cells use to
repair the damage caused by UV
rays from the Sun. Those born
with defects in this repair system
develop skin cancer when exposed
to sunlight, making the discovery
crucial to cancer research.
Finally, Paul Modrich was

prematurely released obituary for
himself.
His legacy created a series
of awards for individuals who
bestowed the “greatest benefit on
mankind” with their work in in
physics, chemistry, physiology or
medicine, literature and peace. A
related Nobel Memorial Prize in
Economic Sciences was added in
1968.
Each Nobel Prize is awarded by an
institution and chosen from a list of
names recommended by the Nobel
Committee after nominations
have been received. The decision is
announced immediately after the
vote takes place.
There is often a significant time lag
between the scientific discovery or
work recognised by the Nobel Prize
and its awarding, as the granting
of prizes is typically delayed until
the achievement has been widely
accepted.

were able to determine between
them that the particles can oscillate
between three types – muon, tau
and electron.
This mysterious behaviour means
that the particles have mass – albeit
an almost immeasurably tiny mass.
The new discovery was hugely
important for physics. “When you
do not know whether they have
mass, it’s otherwise difficult to
understand how to incorporate
them into those theories that give us
a more fundamental understanding
of the world of physics,” McDonald
said in an interview.
“We are very satisfied that we
have been able to add to the world’s
knowledge at a very fundamental
level. This recognition is a
tremendous accolade for our group”.
researcher from China. By splitting
the award, the Committee chose to
honour two different research teams
fighting a common battle against
parasitic infections.
“Thetwodiscoverieshaveprovided
humankind with powerful new
parasites associated with domestic
and farm animals.
The team headed up by Campbell
was able to isolate the compound
Avermectin, developing it into an
entirely new class of drugs to treat
the parasitic worm infections in
humans. The US-based company
Merck, which housed the team,
announced in 1987 that it would
make the drug Ivermectin available
to all free of charge.
Campbell initially did not believe
the news of his prize after being
woken by a call from a reporter.
In a statement to the press he
emphasised the significance of the
rest of his team’s contribution to the
discovery.
He also urged scientists to
continue to search the natural world
for inspiration in developing new
treatments:“One of the big mistakes
we’ve made all along is that there
is a certain amount of hubris in
humans thinking that we can create
molecules as well as nature can”.
Satoshi Ōmura said that he was
“very surprised” to be receiving the
prize, but would “humbly accept” it.
“It’s a very happy day”.

diseases that affect hundreds
of millions of people annually,”
the Nobel committee said. “The
consequences in terms of improved
human health and reduced suffering
are immeasurable”.
recognised for his demonstration
of a mechanism called mismatch
repair, which explains how living
cells correct those errors that occur
when DNA is replicated during cell
division, reducing the frequency of
mistakes.
The secretary general of the Royal
Swedish Academy of Sciences,
Göran Hansson, announced the
winners of the prize in Stockholm
saying:“This year’s prize is about the
cell’s toolbox for repairing DNA”.
He explained that the new Nobel
Laureates have each “provided
fundamental insights into how cells
function”.
