members of Cross
Country and Athletics
boarded minibuses, cars and trains
to begin our summer tour training
week in Wales. Some hours later
we had arrived at our destination:
the beautiful Castell Courtyard
in North Wales. Situated on a
picturesque hillside (well, mountain,
technically) this huge holiday home
had every comfort we could possibly
need – including a ten person hot
tub – and this was a welcome
addition considering the gruelling
week’s training coming up! On
arrival most got straight to it with a
run. A hearty dinner set the tone for
the rest of the week, with big meals
needed to supply big appetites!
Alumnus Jack, arriving late, decided
to get in on the running action
despite it being dark, and only ran
into one fence.
The next day Jack and Ellie drove
over to Snowdonia to do some
training for an upcoming two day
mountain marathon. Fellow runners
Lily and Lucie also joined them,
running up Snowdon and back
with enough time to watch the end
of the British Mountain Running
Championships.Back at the house a
morning run was followed by a core
session and then a brutal hill sprint
in the afternoon.Club captain Liam

Smith organised music to encourage
everyone to push up the hills. A big
roast dinner was a welcome treat
and the last night of some departing
club members was cause for some
‘minor’ celebrations.

early on Sunday morning for the
traditional long run. Jack, Ellie and
Will ran up the highest mountain in
the area – Berwyn – which turned
out to be quite an epic as it required
climbing another mountain just
to get to it! Chris Bannon and
Chris Thomas also went mountain
running and had a surprise meet up
with Jack and Ellie on the way back.
Others went in search of flatter
running ground and found Lake
Vyrnwy; a lovely 18km loop that
we would return to for more runs
later in the week. Back at the house
Social Secretary Anna Lawson led a
tough circuits session to prepare us
for the arrival of our strength and
conditioning master Rob the next
day. A chilled evening was spent
preparing for Anna’s birthday the
next day.
The next morning we all drove
back over to Lake Vyrnwy. Some
of us ran a full lap with the three
Chrisses laying down the pace
and others getting a lift half way.
Women’s captain Sarah came along
on her bike to provide some passing
motivation as she smashed a couple
of laps. We rejoined at the end to
have a nice picnic in the sun by the
lake shore before heading back.
After a group stretching session led
by club veteran Alwyn, Rob made
sure we hadn’t been slacking on the
circuits which suitably knackered
anyone who wasn’t already too
tired to move. Surprise birthday
brownie cake was as good a cure as
any and kicked off a fun night of
celebrations.
Tuesday morning was a more
relaxed affair with the big focus
of the day being an afternoon trip
to the Queensway Stadium in
Wrexham for a track session, which
handily coincided with an urgent
request for the minibus to get an
MOT.
The club split into two groups –
one doing a long distance session
of kilometre reps and the other
doing a middle distance session
consisting of 300m sprints with
reducing rest between each one.
Strong winds couldn’t get in the
way of some seriously fast running
and encouragement from Liam and
Tom resulted in everyone leaving it
all out on the track. ‘GB Boy’ Chris
Olley ran so many laps that the rest
of us started getting dizzy! Minibus
returned, we headed back for the
house for a chilled out evening.
With the end of the week nearly
in sight, Wednesday morning
started with some more relaxed
runs. Ophelie, Lily and Lucie
took the chance to explore some
picturesque waterfalls nearby. Rob,
still not satisfied, put on another
circuits session before secretary
Alex subjected us to a brutal core
workout that began with an “easy
warm up” of a four minute plank.
Dinner was baked potatoes with
just about every imaginable filling as
we tried to use up all our remaining
food.
The final day meant it was time
for a race! We returned to Lake
Vyrnwy one last time for seven
kilometre handicapped time trial
with start times determined from
five kilometre personal bests – the
intention being that if everything
went right we’d all finish at the same
time. This made for an exciting
finish and with everything coming
down to the last kick, experienced
club member Duncan took the win.
A post race BBQ was a welcome
treat for everyone, and once packed

we spent the afternoon and evening
enjoying the last of the holiday by,
of course,finding out just how many
people we could fit into the hot tub!
A huge amount of work from a
lot of people went into organising
the tour and making sure it went off
without a hitch, particularly from
Liam, Will, Matt, Sarah, Duncan
and Alex.
If you’d like to join the club please
email us at run@ic.ac.uk, we’d love to
hear from you. After all, we didn’t
win Sport Imperial Club of the Year
for nothing!
Pretty sure taking this picture slowed the runner down. Photo Credit: ICXC
