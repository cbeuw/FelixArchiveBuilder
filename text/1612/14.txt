Absent:Tristan Sharps in Conversation
W
hile I’m not
generally a fan of
phone interviews,
there’s something
quite fitting about not being with
Tristan Sharps for our conversation.
Tristan calls himself a dreamer, and
I’m just imagining all the amazing
spaces he could be while we’re
having our conversation. A man
whose work stems from the space
he inhabits, the idea that he could
be anywhere quite appeals to me.
Having been completely
absorbed by Absent earlier in the
week – Tristan’s new installation
at Shoreditch Town Hall – I am
only too aware of this man’s creative
power. There are many wondrous,
powerful artworks that can captivate
an audience,but few art forms are as
freeing and individual as site specific
theatre. The ability to take part in a
work and be surrounded by it, has
an effect on people that observing a
work from afar cannot match. This
is the brilliance and skill of Tristan’s
creations. The designer of these
wonderful worlds,Tristan has found
himself a niche in which all aspects
of the creative process can come
together and form something larger
and more impressive. Although
site specific theatre can fly under
the radar, the quality and joy of
work like Tristan’s should not be
understated.
With his dream to be an artist
halted by his inability to draw,
Tristan’s early love for art and
architecture fuelled a move into
the theatre. Founding a theatre
company after college, Tristan
spent a number of years acting and
directing on the fringe. By the mid
90’s, Tristan had found himself
with a group of people all kicking
their heels as to what to do. Given
the opportunity to create a piece
using a whole theatre, not just the
classic black box studio we’re used
to, Tristan seized on a radically
different style of theatre. All the
little areas around started to interest
Tristan – the woodland around the
theatre, the windows looking out
on that woodland, the backstage
areas and the little garden the
public would never otherwise see.
The result of this experience wasn’t
exactly the beginning of Tristan’s
steps into site specific theatre, but
the culmination of all the artistic
endeavours he’d always really loved
and had never been able to connect
together.
With a clear direction and
fresh inspiration to create art in
spaces with no connection to the
theatrical context, Tristan founded
dreamthinkspeak and has been
making thought provoking, unique
work ever since. Having dreamed
up work in a Moscow paper factory
and reimagining an underground
abattoir in Clerkenwell, the scope
of Tristan’s work is staggering. Part
of the joy of experiencing Tristan’s
work is how little feels forced upon
the audience. From collecting
tickets at the venue to having a
drink at the bar afterwards, there
is an impressive consistency and a
dedication to fitting each part of the
setting into the dreamscape Tristan
has generated. The transformation
of Shoreditch Town Hall from
arts venue to hotel for Absent
is all encompassing and wholly
convincing.
Speaking to Tristan about the
creative process, there is a unique
thoughtfulness in how he describes
his relationship with different
diverse venues. Rather than
creating a work and placing it in a
venue, Tristan dedicates himself to
dreaming in a space and allowing his
work to naturally slip into its chosen
location.Progressing into the details
of the piece, the space develops in
a way few other practitioners have
consideration for. In a solitary, time
consuming process, Tristan inhabits
his chosen building with a specific
idea and allows the building to
define the detail to a piece.
Of course, the ideal venue isn’t
alwaysavailabletodreamthinkspeak.
With a number of ideas at any one
time, it is a testament to Tristan’s
artform that he is able to hold off
a project and keep it on the back
burner until the time is right.
Although I can’t judge the suitability
of previous chosen locations, my
experience at Absent suggests a
particularly refined patience. With
detail going into every little corner
of Shoreditch Town Hall - the
signs, the reception, the bar and the
lobby – it is hard to believe this isn’t
really a hotel.
Based on the life of the Duchess
of Argyll,Tristan’s initial inspiration
for Absent came from a small

installation created for the Royal
Opera House in 2009. A piece
in response to Powder Her Face,
the opera by Thomas Adès, the
Duchess of Argyll spent many
years in a central London hotel,
extraordinarily because she had
run out of money. Blagging her
way through her time at the hotel
and living on credit, Tristan has
fictionally extrapolated her story
to describe a young girl moving to
the hotel in the 1950’s and being
evicted in the present day. A view
less into the individual and more
into the development of the hotel
and how it mirrors the increasingly
globalised and homogenised world
we live in. Tristan’s criticism of
corporate power is obvious, but it
is impressive that he has created a
work which doesn’t obnoxiously

MICE-IS:Too DangerousTo Display
F
ar away, in the land of
Sylvania, all woodland
animals have overcome
their differences to live in
harmonious peace and tranquillity.
Until Now.Thus reads the catalogue
note on Isis Threaten Sylvania, a
series of tableaux by artist Mimsy.
The work features scenes of
fuzzy toy woodland creatures in
idyllic anthropomorphic scenes of
classrooms and beaches.Just beyond
the windows or over hills lurk
‘MICE-IS’, black clad Sylvanians
in balaclavas, a pun-filled reference
to the terror group ISIS.
The artwork is surreal enough
already; the circumstances under
which they came not to be exhibited
are so surreal as to beggar belief. It
was to form part of the Passion
for Freedom exhibition in the
Mall Galleries a couple of week
ago. Passion for Freedom is a
not-for-profit organisation which
claims to “create space for artists
and writers who discuss subjects
omitted in politically correct circles”
and “invite people to open and
uninhibited discussion”. When
the police claimed that the art
was too inflammatory and would
cost an extra £36 000 in security,
Passion for Freedom decided not
to show the piece. You know it’s
time to worry when a pro-freedom
of expression organisation starts
censoring art. Passion for Freedom
are far from alone, over the summer,
the National Youth Theatre pulled
out of staging Homegrown a play
exploring the paths that lead young
Britons to become fundamentalists.
In the case of Homegrown, the
National Youth Theatre pulled the
performance after 10 days, citing an
issue with quality.The writers of the
play made it clear that they thought
their voices had been silenced. The
short run was plagued by last minute
changes.The site specific production
was forced to change venue when the
Tower Hamlets council expressed it
would be ‘insensitive’ to stage the
performance at a school close to the
one in Bethnal Green from which
schoolgirls flew to Syria. In August,
several signatories, including Anish
Kapoor and Liberty director Shami
Chakrabarti, wrote a letter to the
National Youth Theatre expressing
their worry that the theatre had
been put under pressure to cancel
the production.
Safety of the artists and the public
should of course be of paramount
importance, however, galleries and
organisations curating exhibitions
should not be so quick to err on
the side of caution. Censorship
only serves to shut down discussion
about important issues that artwork,
such as that by Mimsy, provokes.
After months of watching the
highlighted work was humorously
mocking the despised terrorist
organisation that causes suffering
to many, not only in the Middle
East, but also here, in Europe and
the America”. The artist, Mimsy,
who has adopted this pseudonym to
protect her family, is surely acutely
aware of the costs of exercising the
freedom of expression. To dismiss
her work as being flippant would be
a mistake. Isis Threaten Sylvania is
a poignant and ultimately chilling
satire that mocks the innocence,
and false safety that we live with
in the West. The scenes of girls in
schoolrooms and toy sunbathing
on beaches which were created
between December 2014 and May
2015 have since then tragically
played out in the real world, first
with the kidnapping of schoolgirls
in Nigeria, and then on the beaches
of Tunisia.
The opposition to Charlie Hebdo
receiving the freedom of expression
award from the American
association of Poets, Essayists and
Novelists (PEN) highlights the
difficulty inherent in discussing
freedom of expression issues. Those
who thought Charlie Hebdo should
not have received the PEN award
cited that condemning the violence
perpetrated against them was one
thing, actively celebrating cartoons
designed to be inflammatory was
quite another. It can be a difficult
and often emotive line to negotiate
when self-censorship arises
from a desire to offend religious
orthodoxies and other cultures.
Choosing not to celebrate the artists
and writers who bravely create work
they know will put their lives at risk
slowly erodes the freedom we all
have.It draws the line a little tighter
around the things we are allowed
to say or allowed to think, it feeds
the environment of fear we live in.
Speaking eloquently on the topic,
Michael Attenborough, the artistic
director at the Almeida Theatre
said “the conscience and the soul
of the country consist within the
artistic community of this country,”
adding “once we compromise that,
we compromise something very
serious.”
Unfortunately, self-censorship in
the arts is becoming an increasingly
common issue in Britain. In 2014,
Exhibit B, a show which aimed
to recreate the ‘human zoo’, a
19th
century phenomenon, using
black actors was closed because
of protests. Jude Kelly, artistic
director of the Southbank Centre
has said that there is reluctance
amongst the powers that be within
artistic institutions to put on
politically challenging productions.
Institutions such the National
Youth Theatre and others prefer to
err on the side of caution and play
it politically safe rather than risk
losing in funding from the state.
Self-censorship is a slippery slope.
The more that institutions veto
productions to avoid controversy,
the blander the work will become.
Society as a whole, not just the art
world, will be poorer and less free
for it. We may not always agree
with what an artist has to say, but
it is important that we defend their
right to say it, otherwise we can
hardly complain if we are silenced
in the future.
Passion for Freedom and other
organisations aiming to uphold
the right to freedom of expression
should do so wholeheartedly,
without fear. The state has a role
to play, in order to make sure that
our rights to freedom of expression
do not slip away. The police should
work to supporting organisations
creating thought provoking and
controversial work,not discouraging
them with financial burdens.

You know
it’s time
to worry
when a pro-
freedom of
expression
organisation
starts
censoring
art
atrocities occurring across the
world, the magnitude of what is
happening can become too large
to fully comprehend. When these
events go on for years, even the
reporters leave, it is simply not news
anymore. We need the jarring and
slightly ludicrous juxtaposition of
toy pandas, bears, and rabbits in tiny
handstiched school uniforms who
sitting at the desk,with the threat of
unlikely terror just outside. It brings
back the issues to the forefront and
reminds us exactly what is at stake.
The curators of the Passion for
Freedom event have argued that“the
Isis
Threaten
Sylvania is
a chilling
satire that
mocks the
false safety
that we live
with in the
West
Part of the joy
is how little
feels forced
upon the
audience
force this point.
The result of the endless
overthinking of personal
obsessions, the work on display
is evidently that of a wonderfully
dedicated artist. Never satisfied
with his own work and constantly
tweaking current creations,Tristan
shows continuous ambition but
with great modesty. Turning every
pound of funding into five,Tristan
acknowledges the difficulty of
achieving huge artistic dreams
on a finite budget, but inherently,
Tristan lives to create. His work
is incredible and should not be
missed.
