Goodbye, so long and thanks for all the
volunteering
continued from front page
...the union “increasing our
volunteering and student
development services” before
mentioning that their “strategic
partnersgip with Student Hubs has
come to an end”.
The reasons behind this decision
are contested. Although Imperial
Hub did not receive any funding
from the union, and had not sought
any, a union trustee board agenda
makes the point that there was a
percieved “risk related to Student
Hubs attempting to raise funds
from College Resources”.
Imperial Hub continues to make
the point that students were not
consulted on the decision.The union
says that after discussion between
“union management and officer
trustees [i.e. sabbatical officers] the
view was taken that the partnership
should come to an end as the
intentions of Student Hubs were
becoming clearer”. Members of
the Trustee Board were “not asked
formally to approve this decision
but all responses were supportive”.
The union’s Trustee Board is
made up of an appointed chair,
currently a professor at the college,
five student trustees, lay trustees
and every sabbatical officer bar the
FELIX Editor (who take a year out
of their studies and are paid by the
union). The Trustee Board is legally
responsible for the union.
The hub’s central office employed
a member of staff to coordinate
their activities at Imperial and the
hub’s statement says the decision
has the potential to cause three
redundencies.
At least one Imperial Hub staff
member was was given office
space in the union building, and
society level privileges for room
booking within it. With this, the
union was able to include Imperial
Hub’s successes in its reports on
volunteering, since the hub was a
partner of Imperial College Union.
Imperial Hub elected a 2015/16
committeelastacademicyear,asthey
had no idea their future partnership
with the union was under threat. In
an official statement released by the
hub, they said that the union had
“made it as difficult as possible for
the student committee to continue”
and have“refused to have discussions
about considering them as a student
society, and have offered support
only if the committee no longer
works with Imperial Hub”.
At Tuesday’s Freshers’ Fair, the
committee were not allowed a
stand, posters or banners, and were
instructed by the union not to
wear their Imperial hub branded
clothing. Some of their flyers were
taken away by union staff, but they
still managed to get four hundred
sign ups.
In an open letter to the president
of the union and several union staff
members, the President of the hub,
Daniel Chipchase, described how
the union had left the hub members
feeling “betrayed and undervalued”.
The agreement between Imperial
Hub and the union has been official
since 2011, and was formalised by
a Memorandum of Understanding
between the two parties, essentially
agreeing on the terms of their
partnership. In July, the union
sought to add a clause stopping
Imperial Hub from applying to the
College for any funding. The union
said it attempted to “soften the
tone” of this new clause by asking
that Imperial Hub “consult and
agree with [the union] any proposed
agreements with college”.
The union went on to say that
while these negotiations were
going on, Imperial Hub had “been
approaching senior college staff...for
direct support for their activities”,
which they found out after being
“copied into an email response
to [Imperial Hub] from the Vice
Provost (Education)”. Imperial
Hub’s statement disagrees, saying
that these meetings were arranged
by the student committee to
celebrate their achievements and
raise awareness with college, rather
than ask for funding. At a meeting
with Alice Gast, the president of
the college, Imperial Hub said it
was “invited” to bring a proposal
to college, which would include a
request for funding.
The union said it knew the
central hub charity had been set a
fundraising target of £135k, and
the union’s worry seemed to be
that the hub would attempt to
raise this from College, presumably
jeopardising the union’s own
funding applications. Imperial Hub
maintains this figure was taken “out
of context” and would not all have
been requested from the college.
The union currently employs two
members of staff in its Student
Development department. It’s no
secret that they’re looking to hire
two new recruits in this sector, but
Imperial Hubs protests this. In a
statement seen by FELIX, Hubs
wonders why the union didn’t invest
the money they had for these new
staff members into Imperial Hub
given its “proven track record”.
In the same statement from Hubs,
which contests several points in
the union’s Trustee Board agenda
(which is freely available online,
albeit deep within the throngs of
the website), Hubs say that the
union “spoke to partners about
At Freshers’
Fair, the
committee
were
instructed
by the union
not wear
their Imperial
Hub branded
clothing
terminating the partnership before
they had even notified [us]”.
Dominic Falcao, of Imperial
College’s Create Lab, wrote an
open letter expressing dismay at the
decision.“For the meantime,I chose
to ignore your decision,” he said,
“I will continue to send Imperial
students to Imperial Hub”.
It’s too early to tell what this
decision will mean for Imperial
Hub, its volunteers and the projects
its been working on. With open
letters, contradictory statements
and agendas flying, this is one hell
of a break up.
Imperial Hub is no longer affiliated with Imperial College Union. But
why, and how will it affect students?

I have to say I was terribly shocked when I heard
the news. Whatever the reasoning behind the Union’s
decision, nothing speaks more about “building a student
community” and “enhancing student experience” [the
union’s slogans] for me than Imperial Hub. I have learnt
a great deal from working with the organisation, I just
hope Imperial students wouldn’t be denied this unique
opportunity to achieve the same, if not more.

F
ELIX was saddened to hear
of the death of Professor
Danny Segal, who was
Senior Tutor of the
Department of Physics, at the end
of the summer. Professor Segal was
a popular figure in the department,
having been at Imperial on and off
since completing his undergraduate
degree in Manchester in 1983.
Professor Segal’s research
employed spectroscopic techniques
to study the physics of atomic
collisions.He achieved his doctorate
under Keith Burnett in the
Spectroscopy Group – now called
the Quantum Optics and Laser
Science Group – where his talent
for experimental physics helped him
Cecily Johnson
News Editor
in establishing a new laboratory.
After a brief stint at the University
of Oxford, Professor Segal returned
to Imperial for a Fellowship. By
2001 he had been promoted to
Senior Lecturer, then Reader and
finally Professor in 2011. His
colleagues from this time knew him
as an “admirable, sociable and good
humoured” man.
While he was passionate about
his research, Professor Segal also
proved popular as the first Warden
of the Clayponds Hall of Residence
for postgraduate students. Later he
took on the role of Senior Tutor
within the Department of Physics,
supporting the entire student body
with a reputation for understanding
and compassion.
Professor Segal was diagnosed
with a serious brain tumour in
September 2014, undergoing
treatment before ultimately passing
away on 23rd
September 2015 at
the age of 55. He inspired his
friends and colleagues in the way
he “retained his unique character”
throughout this period.
