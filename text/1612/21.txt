CANCER
VIRGO
This week you loudly tell
anyone who will listen that
immigrants are all thieves
and murderers, and that we
should build a wall to keep
them all out.
You instantly rise to the top
of polls in the US Presidential
election. Oh, America.

This week you are Hangman.
You try and write horoscopes
that are as weird and mildly
horrifying as the ones your
horoscopes writer usually
sends you. Unfortunately,
you’re just a sentient,
incorporeal mass of anger
and hatred, and so can’t
actually type anything.
This week you are a fish.
Shut up, we have a paper to
finish.
This week you go to the
Freshers Ball, hoping to
score with all the naive
young freshers. After several
unsuccessful attempts, you
realise that maybe your dorsal
fin and rows of serrated teeth
might be putting them off.
ThisweekyougototheHealth
Centre to get registered. The
queue stretches back outside
and into Prince’s Gardens,
and is so long that you are
there for two weeks. You
catch pneumonia and die.
This week you lose your
ID card, in the hope that a
popular celebrity will find it
and tweet about it to give it
back to you.
Unfortunately, the local coke
addict is the first person to
find your card, and it’s never
seen again.
This week your new boy/
girlfriend from halls suggests
it’s time to take things to
the next level. Thrilled that
they share your passion for
video game all-nighters, you
buy new controllers for the
occasion. They dump you for
being a massive nerd.
This week you make the
fatal error of going to the
Union during the day time,
in an attempt to see what it
really looks like without beer
goggles.
There’s no punchline, we just
really don’t advise coming to
the Union when sober.
This week you question
the choice of image for the
‘Virgo’ horoscope. For some
reason, it just makes you
uncomfortable, but you’re
not sure why. Is it the heavily
implied nudity? Whatever
the woman is holding? Or do
you just hate the colour red?
This week you are called
Helen. Your roommate is
called Helen. The hall senior
on your floor is called Helen.
Your warden is Helen. Your
computer is Helen. Your
personal tutor is Helen. All
women are Helen. Everyone
is Helen. All hail Helen.
This week you find yourself
absent-mindedly flicking
through back issues of
FELIX, because apparently
you have no life. In issues
from years ago, you stumble
across a centrefold featuring
your mum. Good luck
unseeing that one.
This week you decide that
the horoscopes aren’t as good
as they used to be, and that
you could do a way better job
than this bunch of wankers.
You email your horoscopes to
hangman@imperial.ac.uk, and
demand that they are printed.
You’re so needy.
HOROSCOPES
B
ecause we’re nothing if
not lazy, we’re reviving
the ol’ advice column for
another week. Go us.
Traditionally, this sort of article
(or ‘listicle’, thanks for that gem,
internet) would open with some
sort of anecdote. Hangman doesn’t
much care for tradition, but here we
go anyway.
So. Hangman made the mistake
of going to the Freshers Mingle last
weekend.
We didn’t mean to. We were just
trying to get this page done early
and we got trapped by hundreds of
freshers. Hundreds, we tell you.
Maybe not hundreds. We’re not
really sure. All we saw was a bunch
of drunk, gropey people in our way.
Hangman would apologise if you
were one of the freshers we pushed,
shoved, growled at or generally
looked at with a withering glare,
but we’re not sorry. Hangman has
no time for regrets.
All this (necessary) violence
against those new to Imperial got
Hangman thinking: how, after the
sweaty, alcohol-infused buzz of
the first few weeks of university,
does anyone survive the crushing
boredom and pressure of doing an
actual degree?
Hangman would have asked other
students what helped them make
it through the year, but that would
have been too much like actual
journalism.
We’ll have none of that in the
Hangman section, thank you very
much.
Instead, we just made some
observations about life, safe in our
cave under the West Basement.
And because Hangman bloody
loves listicles (“love ‘em, can’t get
enough of the things,” said no-one
ever), here is one of those. About
whatever we were just talking about.
Drinking
Hangman has noticed an awful
lot of people spending time in the
Union. The only possible reason for
this must be the relatively cheap
alcohol (only one arm and half a leg,
compared to most London pubs’
multiple-limbs-per-pint pricing
structure), and the ability/need
to consume large quantities of it.
Hangman can think of no other
reason to come to this godforsaken
place.
TV
‘Netflix and chill’ is the latest
piece of nonsense that has wormed
its way onto Twitter/Tumblr/Social
Network 7 - yes, Hangman uses
social media. We’re not a bunch of
cave men. Although we do live in a
cave.
Apparently people enjoy
mindlessly staring at a screen as
the pictures on it change and noises
come out. This is what counts for
entertainment now. What a world
we live in.
Drinking
While watching TV? Who knows.
Hangman doesn’t.
Social Media
Because there’s nothing quite
like the thrill of seeing what other
people are doing in their equally
pointless lives, but all from the
comfort of your own home/bed/
sofa/cage without actually having to
go to the effort of doing those things
or seeing those people yourself.
Believe it or not, Hangman is
actually quite fond of social media,
thanks to its suite of tools for
ignoring people (or just winding
them up).
Our favourite is reading people’s
messages, then deliberately not
answering. Their increasing panic/
anger as they watch you read every
single message and respond with
deafening silence is one of life’s
greatest pleasures.
If only you could just block
everyone (or report the particularly
annoying ones as spam) in real life.
Drinking
While on social media? Probably.
Hangman has to do it to cope with
the inanity of it all.
Reading FELIX
Hangman is a big fan of the classic
‘joke entry on a serious list’ style
of doing these things. Consider
this that joke entry. Nobody reads
FELIX. Not even you.
Uni SurvivalTips (But Just theTips)
Hangman continues to neglect actual journalism in favour of this rubbish
