UnderTale is this year’s indie masterpiece
U
nderTale takes place in
a world that has been
divided by a war between
humans and monsters.
In their victory, the humans sealed
the monsters underground.You play
as a child who has fallen into the
underworld as they seek to to return
to the surface. It’s a set-up that’s
instantly familiar but in UnderTale
it’s merely the backdrop to a far
greater and more personal conflict.
The first character you meet
is Flowey the Flower. At first,
this seems nothing more than a
harmless introduction to the game’s
mechanics but Flowey’s happy
demeanour and the accompanying
playful chiptune hide something far
more sinister. The music stops and
Floweycackles,“inthisworld,it’skill
or BE killed”.This would be true for
any other JRPG however UnderTale
has one noticeable difference –
the freedom to be merciful.
Random encounters and boss
battles are where UnderTale
innovates the most.The four options
available in each ‘battle’are FIGHT,
ACT, ITEM and MERCY. When
you ACT, you can converse with
‘enemies’ and interact with each
one in unique ways. You can steal,
hug, touch, sing and sometimes
even flirt (skeletons make great
dates). If and when you console a
monster correctly you can spare
them – making an entirely pacifist
playthrough possible.There’s still the
option to fight, like in conventional
JRPGs (which requires you to time
your key presses to deliver optimal
damage), but the game is most fun
when you leave your foes uninjured.
Even when you’re being nice,
monsters will still fight back and
you’ll have to dodge their attacks
in a top down bullet hell style

UnderTale
has one
noticeable
difference –
the freedom
to be
merciful
mini-game where you control your
heart as you avoid projectiles. Add
in more enemies and this becomes
increasingly chaotic. Bosses add
interesting twists to this mechanic,
providing some of the game’s
most memorable experiences.
When you’re not battling
monsters, you’ll be solving
environment based puzzles. These
are easily the weakest part of the
game – they’re wholly unoriginal
and offer little challenge. In the
context of the story they make
sense but they quickly become
tiresome and you’ll wish there was
an option to skip these sections.
The writing in UnderTale is
often hilarious and at other times
shockingly depressing. It’s littered
with awful puns and self-aware
jibes aimed at the JRPG genre.
The dialogue in battle and whilst
exploring the underground is just
one part of the game’s fantastic
characterisation; lo-fi sprites
reminiscent of Earthbound or
Mother 3 (and the SNES-era in
general) create characters that are
impressively diverse and unique.
Tumblr is already full of fan-art
giving testament to the popularity
and originality of these designs.The
different colour palettes throughout
each of the game’s environments
are matched perfectly with the epic
and haunting soundtrack. Toby Fox
has composed music for popular
webcomic Homestuck (along with
a number of other projects) in the
past and his experience shows
here. Catchy chiptune tracks
are mixed with expertly layered
sampled instruments. At times,
this mish-mash of genres feels
jarring but the consistent quality
and originality of the compositions
makes this one of the year’s
best videogame soundtracks.
Recently there has been a trend
of superficial choices in games.
Save one character and let another
die or say something that might
offend an NPC and they’ll hold
that against you forever. In most of
these situations the outcome at the
end is still the same and there’s very
little emotion behind the decisions
that you make. UnderTale feels
different, not only in the way that
it forces you to make decisions
so often but also in how essential
these decisions are to its themes and
mechanics. You can kill everyone
in the underworld or spare every
monster you come across and
your experience will be drastically
different. Ultimately, UnderTale
makes the statement that there is
another way: not all battles can or
need to be resolved with violence.
It recognises that understanding
and compassion are essential if
we truly wish to resolve conflicts
– a message that is all too obvious
and yet so commonly ignored.
UnderTale, by tobyfox, is available
now on Steam.
