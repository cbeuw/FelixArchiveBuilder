Libertines: Renewed and Raging
N
obody would have
thought that after the
split of The Libertines
back in 2004 they
would ever perform again, let alone
record another studio album. Pete
Doherty’s (vocals/guitar) descent
into a serious crack cocaine and
heroin addiction caused tensions
in the band, particularly between
himself and other front man Carl
Peter Munton
Writer
Barât which ultimately led to the
end of the band 11 years ago. The
media’s coverage of Doherty’s drug
addiction and involvement in crime
destroyed the band’s reputation,
making it almost unthinkable that
the music industry (or the public)
would ever welcome them back into
mainstream music culture.
However, after a series of
successful reunion gigs in 2010,
including both Reading and Leeds
festivals, a reformation looked
increasingly likely. It was not until
the beginning of 2015, after it
was announced that Doherty had
successfully completed his rehab
treatment in Thailand, that The
Libertines returned to the studio to
record their third album.
The anticipation surrounding
the band’s reunion led to a
unprecedented hype focused on
their headline slots. Questions were
being asked: has Doherty’s and
Barât’s relationship finally been
recovered? Will they ever be as
good as they used to be? Will their
performance live up to the hype?
With a ticket for the Sunday
of Reading Festival, I was
overwhelmingly excited to see them
for the first time. But this would
happen before expected.
In June, they performed as special
guests on the Pyramid stage at
Glastonbury, replacing the hole that
the Foo Fighters and Dave Grohl’s
broken leg had left. Throughout
the day rumours spread across the
Glastonbury site about who the

special guest would be, with most
suggesting that The Libertines
would play. On a sunny Somerset
evening, crowds lined the field
waiting expectedly for a special
guest worthy of the Pyramid stage.
The rumours did not disappoint
as the likely lads charged onto the
stage blasting out ‘The Delaney’
with such enthusiasm that they
received a huge roar from the tens
of thousands in the crowd.
They thundered through their set
which included songs from their
new album such as the live debut of
‘Anthems for Doomed Youth’ (the
title track) as well as old classics
like ‘Can’t Stand Me Now’ to the
upmost joy of the festival goers.
They finished off their set with a
rendition of ‘Don’t Look Back Into
the Sun’which left fans chanting for
more.
The crowds left the stage certainly
feeling surprised.The appearance of
The Libertines may well have even
been a surprise to the band members
themselves as the replacement
would’ve been so last minute and
potentially rushed.
This was somewhat evident in the
band’s first live festival performance
of the year; their set seemed a little
clunky and chaotic, lacking the
polished look and sound that one
would expect from such a skilled
quartet. Being such an unexpected
gig, this could not be held against

them, as replacement shows have a
reputation of not always living up
to standards. It was going to be very
interesting to see The Libertines
headlining Reading, a night that
they had prepared and rehearsed for
heavily in advance.
When the moment finally came
for their performance at Reading,
there was the feeling that the newly
reformed band had to fight to prove
The media’s
coverage of
Doherty’s
drug
addiction
destroyed
the
reputation
of the band
themselves worthy to be back at the
top.The intro of Vera Lynne’s ‘We’ll
Meet Again’ softly hummed out
of the speakers, consequently the
packed crowd chorused along to the
famous lyrics.The air of anticipation
was at its highest.
As the band members made their
way onto stage kicking off with
‘Horror Show’,the audience erupted
into a series of mosh pits, crowd
surfers and red hot burning flares
lighting up the night sky. Madness
ensued as the likely lads made
their way through the hit heavy
set long into the night. The energy
and precision of the performance
renewed their previously damaged
reputation and earned them a place
at the top of raging rock music.
Their third studio album Anthems
for Doomed Youth was released on
the 11th
of September. The chaotic
sounds of their 2004 album The
Libertines has been replaced by
a more mature and witty elegiac
sound, perhaps an indication of all
they have been through.
Some argue that it is their best
album yet; whatever the case it’s
well worth a listen. The Libertines
start their tour at the beginning of
2016 and they’ll be playing at the
O2 arena in London on the 30th of
January. If you are a Libertines fan
this is a show not to miss.
Anthems for Doomed Youth is
available now on Virgin Records
Drake / Future - What aTime to Be Alive
Collaborations between hip-hop
artists in their prime rarely see the
light of day. Delays follow delays,
followed by furtherly delayed delays,
leaving ample time for the novelty
of the idea to fizzle out (Kanye/
Pharell/Lupe Fiasco) or for artists
to sufficiently diverge artistically
(Kendrick/J Cole). It should then
come as little surprise that the
existence and masterful execution
of What a Time to Be Alive’s release
was not at all expected. Drake
and Future, two members of ’15
hip-hop’s top echelon of rappers,
released their joint mixtape a week
after rumors first hit the internet,
and only months after bagging a
critically acclaimed #1 solo album
each.The first official announcement
of the tape, live on Apple’s Beats 1
radio, was immediately followed
by its leak-free debut, providing a
shared listening experience rarely
seen these days. If nothing else, it
should serve as an example of how
to release an album in the social-
media age. What if The Weeknd
circa 2011 and FKA twigs delivered
an EP out of the blue, sans irritating
pre-release promo run? Or Frank
Ocean and James Blake? Or Jay-Z
and Kanye West (still not over
‘H.A.M.’)?
Future is the powerhouse at the
helm of hip-hop’s Atlanta-birthed
melodic renaissance. Known for

made nearly everything he’s done in
the past year downright addictive.
A mixtape three-peat followed by
July’s stellar DS2 cemented Future’s
reputation for consistency and
dedication to his fan-base. Hip hop
purists be warned- lyrical content
takes a backseat to phonetics among
‘New Atlanta’ artists, and Future
regularly uses auto-tune to further
gruff-up his voice. Plus, I’m pretty
sure Future freestyles most of his
lines; I refuse to believe anyone
could actually write down “I put my
thumb in her butt.”
Drake’s been running the rap
game since 2013. The Lil Wayne
protégé’s presence on a track has
become so synonymous with
a hit that making it without a
Drake feature is considered an
achievement in its own right. He’s
also a soppy, manipulative middle-
class Canadian former child actor
who really likes his sandwiches
(YouTube it). Drake’s initial foray
into aggressive chest puffing with
Worst Behavior felt a tad awkward,
but after a year of braggadocios
features and the rapid fire slew
of bangers on this years If You’re
ReadingThis It’sToo Late,I think I’m
ok with bearded gym-rat Drizzy 2.0
and ex-drug dealer Future ‘Hendrix’
side by side. Both products of the
emotionally transparent melody-
infused rap pioneered by Kid Cudi
& Kanye West back in ‘08, yet
separated by their widely distant
subject matter and deliver, Future
and Drake had the capacity to make
something really special.
Which is why I was pretty
underwhelmed after noticing that
if you leave off the last two tracks,
WATTBA is a really, really good
Future tape with Drake featuring
on every track. The fact that even
this disappointment is still one of
the best pop-rap releases of the year
is a testament to the duo’s ability.
Future pushes himself lyrically for
Drake’s audience (no odd orifice
insertions or homophobic slurs this
time around), delving further into
his drug use as a coping mechanism.
Worry not- the staple themes of
strippers, heartbreak and crime are
all still very present.Throughout the
tape Future displays his unrivalled
talent for conveying emotion
through auto-tuned vocals; his
hoarse croaks of despair on ‘Live
from the Gutter’ draw instant
empathy. The penultimate track,
Future’s solo effort ‘Jersey’, has him
confessing his regrets in a defeated,
gritty panic, and although it’s no
‘Codeine Crazy’, the song ranks
among his best to date.
Drake continues to do what he
does best. Jumping on and then
developing flows lain down by
Future, he delivers quotable after
quotablewithundeniableconfidence
and precision. The absurd hook on
‘Big Rings’ begs to be belted out
loud, and his sing-song rapping
is used to expert effectiveness on
‘Scholarships’.The inflections at the
end of each of his lines are nothing
short of delightful. The tape closes
with ‘30 for 30’, a strong contender
for Drake’s most technically
brilliant song yet, in which he
glides through gentle pianos over a
muffled soul sample punctuated by
muted drums, effortlessly switching
between impeccable flows made all
the more impressive by the minimal
beat.
The first thing heard on WATTBA
is Metro Boomin’s iconic producer
tag, followed shortly by Southside’s,
and the two clearly deserve the
recognition. Handling the majority
of the production, their infectious
synths and punchy drum patterns
are guaranteed to incite awkward
head-bobs in public. The hazy lean-
influence seen on other Future
releases is polished and toned down
for Drake’s audience, but the beats
remain very much typical of Future.
Other personal highlights include
Neenyo’s ethereal stripper ballad
in 3/4, ‘Plastic Bag’; even if I don’t
fully understand the stripper/client
dynamic, it’s smooth as hell.
Unfortunately, Drake and Future
don’t interact nearly enough. Bars
are never traded, and the two
capable singers only harmonize
on ‘Diamonds Dancing’, albeit
to stunning effect (that is before
Drake embarks on two minute rant
to an ex peppered with scoffs and
harrumphs). Maybe the distance
is put there for a reason; Drake
frequently raps about his rich-
womanizer woes immediately after
Future’s laments over a dark and
troubled past. An amalgamation
of their two individual styles would
have been to die for, but I think
I’m expecting a bit much from
something recorded in 6 days.
If you enjoy well-made contagious
bangers, listen to What A Time To
Be Alive. Filled with hard-hitting
pop-rap songs from the biggest in
the game, pre-existing fans won’t
be left disappointed. Dominated
by Future’s aesthetic but discernibly
elevated by Drake’s Midas touch,
WATTBA raises some questions
about the Toronto pop-star’s future.
Is WATTBA a tactical play, tapping
into Future’s notoriously loyal fan
base as a safety net for a well overdue
experimental solo record, or is it
merely asserting his position as the
prince of rap by releasing what could
be his second platinum record of the
year? Either way, Drake’s strategy of
jumping on buzzing songs has now
evolved into latching onto another
artist’s sound, a far cry from 2013’s
irrefutable boast of: “Give these
n*ggas the look, the verse and even
the hook/That’s why every song
sound like Drake featuring Drake.”
