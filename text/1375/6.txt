Felix self-help
The kind-hearted souls in the Felix
office have recently been concerned
thatthestudentsofImperialaresuf-
fering from post-Christmas blues.
In response to this we have decided
to run a self-help section each week
to help guide our readers through
to sunnier times and exams.
The first issue we seek to address
is personal appearance and self-es-
teem. After a lengthy debate we feel
we have the best solution for those
of you feeling (and looking) a little
worse-for-wear. We came up with
this easy-make personal paper bag.
Can you think your way out of it?
