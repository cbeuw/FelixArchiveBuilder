Musical Theatre Soc
presents:-
Batboy is being performed by
Musical Theatre Society from
6th to 10th March (starting
7.30pm). This dynamic
romance is complicated by
Batboy’s struggle to not only
control his blood lust but also
his desire to be accepted
by a backward deep south
community. Whilst being cared
for by the Parker family, we
discover the secrets of Batboy
and the characters around
him. This show offers drama,
excitement, romance, horror
and a heavy peppering of
comedy.
Buy your tickets in advance
from Union Reception or Level
2 Sherfield at lunchtimes
from Monday 26th February.
Alternatively you can buy on
the door - £5 students / £7
non-students.
