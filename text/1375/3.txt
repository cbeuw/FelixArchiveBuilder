Felix needs you.
Without your contributions, Felix is nothing.
We’re currently in need of:
A Features Editor – someone
committed and imaginative who’s
ready to co-ordinate new features and
interviews.
Features writers – people who want to add to
their portfolio of writing by producing regular
features.
A Business Editor – to restore the Business
section to a regular weekly page.
News Reporters – reliable people who can
research and write stories every week.
Regular commentators – people with
something to say who want a regular column.
Writers for every section – especially
Science, Arts, Film, and Nightlife.
