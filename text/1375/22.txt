To celebrate the end of a long, ar-
duous shambles of an election cam-
paign, I’ve written you all a wee
crossword. Be grateful.
It’s not very funny, it’s not too
easy, nor too hard, and it’s full of
cocking anagrams, so you lot should
all be rimming it. Some of it doesn’t
even make any sense. But nothing’s
made up, and it’s all possible.
I’ll take pity on you all, since you’re
hardly likely to know what 27 across
is unless you’re a chemist, and not
many chemists have submitted so-
lutions in the past (a bit dim, may-
be?) - 27 across is “speiss”. No, re-
ally. Would I lie to you?
Don’t answer that.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
A seeing-eye dog was
undressing me with
its eyes, so I maced
him. It gave me great
satisfaction, but no
tail (if you understand
the vernacular). I’ve had a serious
problem recently with pirates fol-
lowing me in the high street. Note
to self: buy more mace.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
I like to blind people
with camera flashes
then grab their
unmentionables.
It’s more fun than
chloroform, and less
expensive than GHB. However,
it costs me a fucking fortune in
Duracell extra-long-life batteries. I
should buy shares in them.
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
Let me tell you
something about me,
babe. I’m bad. Bad to
the bone. My badness
knows no bounds. It
stretches out further
than a hooker in a blender, and
much further than two hookers in
a blender, but only just about as far
as three hookers in a blender.
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
You realise the elec-
tions are a bigger
waste of time than
attempting to carve a
1/10th size replica of
Mount Rushmore out
of your own skin peelings. There-
fore, you make a 1/10th size replica
of Mount Rushmore out of your
own skin peelings.

Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
You know what isn’t
funny? Herpes. It
really isn’t. I’ve spent
the whole week saying
‘herpes’ to random
passers-by, and now I
have a cold sore. Poetic justice, or
just a direct consequence of licking
public toilets? Only my parole of-
ficer knows the truth.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
I once knew a man
who set fire to his
farts. This is, in fact,
a far more danger-
ous act than Youtube
makes it look. There
is always the risk of internal flame
ingestion, which can lead to seri-
ous burns on the sphincter of the
participant.
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
Today’s mopey bas-
tard phrase is used
in a pub when served
an incomplete pint:
“I can tell you how to
sell more beer.” Idiot
barman (who is no doubt thinking
about burying an ice axe in your
cranium): “Oh yeah? How?” You:
“Fill up your fucking pints.”
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
My favourite jungle
ape is the bonobo.
I’ve never been very
fond of the baboon
or common chimp,
and I have no love for
the orangutan. Gorillas? I say pff.
Nothing but oversized carpets with
eyes. Yes, I am very fond of the
bonobo.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
Why I shouldn’t drink,
part 42. Last week, I
consumed a goodly
amount of ale at
yonder public house,
and awoke next morn-
ing to find I fallen asleep in bed on
a plate of chips. Said chips were
throughly mashed into my chest
hair. I ate them all. HAHAHAHA
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
I like big butts and I
can not lie / You other
brothers can’t deny /
That when a girl walks
in with an itty bitty
waist / And a round
thing in your face / You get sprung
Wanna pull up tough / Cuz you notice
that butt was stuffed / Deep in the
jeans she’s wearing (cont. page 94)
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
This week, nothing
happens.
Really.
