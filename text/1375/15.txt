I, Gamer
G
aming is about
being the best.
Comparatively,
at least. Clearly,
there are plenty of
people who (quite rightly) might
question whether being good at
games is such a good thing after
all. But the best way to play is to
play to win.
This week is about winning.
Some of it’s about working
together to win – if you can call
our death-addled trip through
the ranks of SWAT a “win”, that
is. Some of it’s about setting
off on a course to be the best
– alright, Warcraft III mods
don’t polish up into personal
development movies as well as
boxers or superheroes do, but
you get the idea.
It’s quite hard for designers
to play around with the idea of
winning. Recently, one of the
developers of Empire Earth
published an article on the
idea of forcing a player to lose
in certain situations. Even
though it was the worst crime
a developer could commit, he
said, it could prove to be one of
the most powerful design tools
when used properly.
Hideo Kojima – the plot-
crazed madman behind the
Metal Gear Solid series –
frequently talks about his desire
to create a game that “locks”
after you die – effectively
granting you one life, one go
at the game before it renders
itself unplayable. Winning
then becomes something very
different indeed.
Gamers can be split into those
who play multiplayer and those
who don’t. The single-players
are trained to fight against a
computer and win, so they tend
to look for quick patterns and
ways to solve problems using
earlier ideas. But the ones
that play online are forced to
keep changing and thinking in
different ways.
Maybe everyone does need
a good kick up the arse from
designers? Single-player games
need the concept of winning
to be redefined to stop games
getting repetitive – narrative-
driven games tend to be better
at shaping this idea of “victory”.
Multiplayer gamers, on the
other hand, are getting too
complacent with the idea of
gaming. Counterstrike cuts
down the die-and-respawn
sentiment, but until someone
has the balls to take Kojima’s
idea onto shop shelves, it’s not
quite the same.

This week in videogaming
Following last week’s coverage
of the sghOpen tournament 2007
comes an announcement of ICGC’s
first cash gaming tournament
(playing for cash, not with it), which
will run in mid-March and promise
a variety of prizes from £50 to £200.
There are four games to compete
in – Warcraft III, Counterstrike 1.6,
Pro Evolution 6, and DotA. Sign-
ups for Warcraft and Pro Evolution
close on March 2nd (the day of our
release, so hurry!) and signups for
CS1.6 and DotA close on the 9th –
www.imperialcgc.com for more in-
formation, but don’t forget to check
out our article on DotA this week if
you want to find out more about the
game.
Finance is a funny thing in the
real world. This week we’ve had
news of forthcoming price drops in
all of the next-gen consoles, partly
due to lower production costs –
Sony is outsourcing Cell production
rather than trying to co-ordinate it
in-house – but mainly due to a race
to compete financially as the early
stages come to a close.
But this week also provided re-
ports that consumers are likely
to get stung in the next twelve
months with continuing high prices
for much online content. Sony has
boasted about free online access
to the Playstation3’s main hub, but
prices for other services remains
high, and the Nintendo Virtual Con-
sole prices seem entirely frozen.
Screen Digest published a report
this week stating that a “small por-
tion” of next-gen games were likely
to be profitable, but most would lose
money due to spiralling production
costs and overinvestment. But this
does lead us to ask – with hardware
manufacturers, software develop-
ers, and consumers all losing out
financially over the next four years
– who exactly is making money?
Strange though it sounds, it could
well be retailers. Already famous
for taking a large cut of the final
sale price, it was thought a few
years ago that the high street would
die off as internet shopping drained
revenues, but American store EB/
GameStop has gone from strength
to strength since the new wave of
Want to kill people for money? CGC is hiring now! Beard/twitchy eye optional

consoles arrived.
Their latest coup is exclusive
games – games which can’t be
bought in any other store in Amer-
ica. Originally, it was the weird, the
quirky, and the not very good, but
they’re stepping up – Tenchu’s lat-
est DS release was a GameStop
exclusive, as will be Settlers when
it releases on the DS soon. If high
street retailing is going to survive,
it might be the only reasonable way
to do it. Of course, reasonable might
be the last thing you’d call it.
Releases on this side of the At-
lantic aren’t so hot this week, but
if you’re a PC gamer there are a
few notable good ‘uns this week
– depending on your opinion of a
Sims 2 add-on that adds Seasons to
the game, of course. FEAR is also
re-released for less than a tenner,
just in time for the average gamer
to have a PC capable of playing it,
and Resident Evil 4 makes an ap-
pearance. The best releases of the
month are still yet to come, how-
ever – the Winter slump is over, and
the games are returning quickly to
the shelves again.
Finally, if you’ve got a bit of spare
cash, make an investment here:
