Y
ou may remember from
last weeks Felix that
I was advertising the
105th Bottle Match and
giving you a brief over-
view of what it’s all about. Well a
week has passed and so has the
Bottle Match, the following few
pages give a sneak insight into the
carnage that was last weekend.
The Bottle Match kicked off in
true style with a traditional RSM
Bar night, as usual the yard glass
made its appearance and the beer
tourettes took us to Belushi’s. Fri-
day morning started with the golf,
and amazingly the sore heads from
the night before didn’t stop the
team making a 9am tee off time!
The squash matches took place in
the evening at Wilson House, fol-
lowed by the obligatory celebra-
tions in the Union.
On Saturday we made our way to
Harlington where hockey (men’s
and women’s), football (men’s) and
rugby (men’s and women’s) were
played. As ever there was much
banter coming from the sidelines
throughout the day, especially dur-
ing the rugby match. One of my
favourite quotes has to be from Sa-
tan, “Is inbred the right term or am
I being politically incorrect?” As
well as the absurd amount of abuse
being thrown at the Camborne min-
ers, a team of enthusiastic RSMers
dazzled the inbreds with a half time
performance of bouncing baps and
balls (they streaked!). Using this
as a distraction, Ents Officer Holly
Sutherland broke through the CSM
defences to snatch some of their
much treasured regalia. 30 seconds
later, Holly was on the floor amidst
a brawl of fists and studs (and not in
a good way!). The end of the match
saw many tears shed, of which we
shall say no more (other than what
is written on the opposite page
– Ed).
Following the matches we migrat-
ed home towards the Union Bar for
a swift 6 halves before our slap up
meal in the SCR. A quick retreat
saw us back in the Union Bar and
Da’Vincis for the presentation and
further carnage. After the handover
of OUR bottle, we challenged CSM
with the final sporting event, the
Captain’s Boat Race. We retained
our pride and absolutely destroyed
them, when will they ever learn?
We look forward to next year when
the Bottle will return!
