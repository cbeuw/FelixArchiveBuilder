Live music up the wazoo
Take two live reviews, one of up-and-comers and another of noise, mix thoroughly
God bless the shared iTunes librar-
ies on the Imperial network, with-
out which I would not have discov-
ered The Freedom Spark, Larrikin
Love’s debut album. After having
listened to it on repeat to the point
where all lyrics were firmly embed-
ded into my memory, I was ecstatic
when Felix offered me to chance to
go and review them.
Usually a dedicated dance music
fan when out and about, I have ap-
preciated indie and its ‘sub-genres’
from afar for a long time, so this gig,
being my first and also my first visit
to Koko, added to the excitement.
It is very easy to lump a lot of the
bands that circle the charts into the
category of indie without looking at
what the band has to offer. Larrikin
Love combines elements of many
genres including folk music, guitar
solos reminiscent of Santana, vo-
cals not dissimilar from the Kooks
and the strong Irish influence is
clear too.
Upon entering Koko I warmed to
it straight away. It had theatre-like
quality in that it is set on many lev-
els, where seating would have been,
with the addition of the boxes over-
looking the stage too. The feel to
the venue was not the beer soaked,
cigarette butt-lined floor as I had
imagined of gigs, but had a more
sophisticated air that matched the
drinks prices too! The night started
with me enjoying the most expen-
sive double vodka and cranberry of
my life (£7.50) and then sticking to
cider for the rest, much more fit-
ting for the occasion anyway!
The stage itself was littered with
various paraphernalia including
a plastic sharks head, a few pot-
ted plants and several inflatable
goats. Rather reflective of Larrikin
Love’s varied music style and also
of the band members’ colourful
personalities.
The Tiny Dancers were first on
the line up and after having been
recommended to me by the Lar-
rikin Love I was keen to see what
they were all about. Fronted by a
singer reminding me slightly of
Axl Rose, but slightly cooler in my
opinion, he sported a fine face of
glitter and entertained a non-danc-
ing crowd with ‘folk rock’ jazzed
up with an eclectic mix of violins
as well as hints of Arabian tones.
I thoroughly enjoyed their set al-
though many in the crowd thought
otherwise: I winced for the Tiny
Dancers as I heard boos and cries
of “Your shit!” coming from the
back and only hoped the laws of
physics combined with the throngs
of people there stopped the shouts
from being heard by the band.
After a twenty minute interlude,
where we were spoilt (ahem) with
the delights of Top 40 rock, the
impatience for Larrikin Love to
come on stage was palpable and
the moment the lights went up a
stampede of fans rushed from the
bar areas to wherever they could
best see Edward (donning a top
hat), Miko (I want his “I know Tom
Frog” T-shirt!), Alfie and Coz. Us
girls stayed on the second level
away from the beer-fueled danc-
ing and beer-fueled beer-throwing
which ensued in front of the stage.
The show kicked off with the much
loved Happy as Annie followed
closely by my personal favourite
Edwoud (the track that drew my
attention to Larrikin Love). Many
tracks were played from the album
as well as some I was not familiar
with. As Downing Street Kindling
marked the end of the show I re-
lated very much to Edward’s senti-
ments “England has nothing more
to offer me” and felt saddened at
the prospects of leaving and re-
turning back to reality. However,
the band and the Tiny Dancers sur-
prised us all with piling back onto
the stage for an encore, kitted out
in silver space suits and partaking
in some post-show drunken stomp-
ing on stage amidst the cheering
and clapping.
While indulging in some Larrikin
Love memorabilia we’ve got to con-
gratulate David Kay, aka Axl Rose,
minus face glitter and ensure him
that the bands set was enjoyed.
I left feeling this was the first of
many gigs I would be attending and
only look forward to seeing the Tiny
Dancers and Larrikin Love again
in the future.

Y
oyo how’s my little mu-
sicarinos? What’s up in
the hizzle? Where you
at dawg? You got the
whole city behind you.
Since with all this Centenary
fever, there will be a resurrection
of of Femm hopefully, since it died
from starvation at the beginning of
this term. Well, I needed to study
and realised that it took up a bit of
my life to put together that thing. I
shall however produce a 100 year
theme, yet to be decided on and
Femm will be big. Yes, hopefully it
will be done soon, maybe not this
term, maybe it will, the suspense!
Along with all this Centenary
craziness I thought that I should
talk about what is happening mu-
sic-wise. Well, let us first look to-
wards the Jazz and Rock society.
Jazz and Rock are dedicated to
providing an affordable practice
space and they are the life-blood
of live music at the College. Like
so many societies, they are only
as good as their members’ activ-
ity so I suggest you join them and
reap the benefits of being part of
an active live music society. You
can pick up experience in being
a soundman or find (good) musi-
cians to make some sweet love-
food with.
The Jazz and Rock society
are organising two events in the
theme of the Centenary: the first
is the Medics vs. Non-medics
Rock-off which is basically battle
od the bands varsity stylee; the
other event is called The Clash of
the Century which will be a huge
battle of the bands competition.
I recommend that you enter the
latter if you are a band, and if you
are not, just go. Go to www.jazzan-
drock.co.uk for more information.
The Medics vs. Non-medics night
is on 6th March and the Clash of
the Century is on the 10th March.
The events are both in dB’s. You
should go.
There will be more musical
events and on 17th March, there
will be a Kids Will Be Skeletons
which will help celebrate the 10th
anniversary of Gringo Records,
a brilliant Nottingham-based
record label. The headliners will
be Souvaris, who appeared at the
union last year and astounded us
all. Following them is Bilge Pump
who are a Leeds-based noise-rock
band who make stonking great
music, and the drummer is one
of the best UK drummers around
at the minute. So get involved and
maybe organise your own events.

live review
Four bands. Half a stage. A pool
tournament. Noise! Noise! Noise!
Smashing into your ears like Rich-
ard Hammond's brain (look, he's al-
right now!); the sound is a perpen-
dicular obtuse triangle pulverised
into a square hole. Oh for the love
of noise.
It’s four bands, and four is a lovely
number, but to honest, only half of
this noise-pie was worth watch-
ing; Geisha. And Yolk. Bristol and
France, united, c'est la revolution!
Geisha – once described as
‘crushing blasts of impossibly hy-
perdistorted rock baked in massive
frequency overload and massive
hooks and melodies and sinister
crushing riffs, all of it slathered in
filthy throbbing feedback and white
noise horror holocaust’ – load up
the stage with what appears to be a
wall of amps.
The ever-decreasing space shifts
Tony and Steve onto the floor and
into the crowd, bringing the per-
Yolk/Geisha
The Plaza
live review
former audience relationship a lit-
tle more sweaty closer. The concept
of Geisha has changed remarkably
during their 5 year existence. After
changing drummers from human
to sub-human to robot (aka Terry
BOTzio, drum machine extrodi-
naire), they have progressed from
the classic 'shout like Alec Empire
and add distortion' to their cur-
rent blood curdling anger sadness
I feel love mash up. The setlist is an
orgy of new songs, with names like
Von Dreck und Feuer, Fulcivision,
Exploitation Cinema in the Work-
place and Bloodbath in Bethlehem
(exclusively renamed at this gig).
You'd think you were in the com-
pany of the great eccentrics, sat
smoking cigars listening to Wagner.
But oh no, it’s two beardy men bash-
ing out distortion in a fury of anger.
The precision of the drum machine
beats and syncopation add a new
dimension to the beautifully miscel-
lany sound of guitar and bass.
The crowd are actually staring
in amazement as the music grows
and dies from synth and bass lined
melodies to an ambience of fuzz and
brutal guitar abuse. It’s music with
sexual frustration, like Berlioz on
speed, watching some girl wearing
pink shoes. If you want a pretty pic-
ture think of Dinasaur Jr colliding
with My Bloody Valentine and Slint,
ripping out the vocal chords of Un-
sane and Helmet. And may I add,
the bassist is a piece of hot ass!
After the onslaught of Geisha's
last song, a version of I Feel Love
that made me want to tear my heart
out and pretend love exists as a
bloody heap of aorta and ventricles,
Yolk gather themselves on stage.
What can I say about Yolk? They
are French. This explains a lot! I've
never cast my eyes on such a gen-
ius group of muscicians. Never in
my small short life.
From only the first few minutes
I think of Mr Bungle immediately,
Bungle with a vagina. The girl is
making those science fiction sounds
from the twilight zone, but she's us-
ing her mouth.
There’s a violin, there’s a sax-
amaphone, and the drummer may
actually have the soul of THE Terry
John Bozzio. The clanking great
big syncopated chords, train track
beats and that good old gypsy folk
melody blend almost too well with
Delphine Delegorgue's bursts of
sound effects. I mean, this girl is
producing the imitation of blow-
ing chunks, then sobbing ghosts. It
progged me in all the right ways.
The night is one big noise tastic
success, so much so that the usual
pub goers, who were in the middle
of watching football and having a
pool tournament managed not to
wave their hairy fists at the bands
or resort to name calling in the vi-
cinity of 'freaks' and such like.
Perhaps the music touched their
little coal-shaped hearts? Or maybe
it proves my theory that at the cen-
tre of us all is a small troll that is
just waiting to mosh out.
