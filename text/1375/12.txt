Oscar night: As shameless as ever
The biggest night in the film calendar brings together the finest on the planet but still misses the sparkle
N
owhere in this world
does a sense of self-
importance permeate
everystreetmorethan
Hollywood. One ego
can’t walk down Sunset Boulevard
without being offset by another. It
has been this way since the sunny
little seaside town was transformed
into the production line of the most
famous movies in the world early
last century, and how better to cel-
ebrate ego than with a little gold
man. This man went on to become
affectionately known, as you may
have guessed, as Oscar.
In case you’d missed it, this week
saw the 79th Academy Awards, the
most prestigious awards ceremony
in the film calendar, and you’d be
hard-pressed to find a bigger cer-
emony in any field given the sway
the movie industry, especially that
of Hollywood, holds today. If you
want artistic recognition, look to
Cannes, but for glam, glitz, and
gold, head here. Win an Oscar and
you can have it on your tombstone.
That will be your legacy.
Or so is the common perception.
Whilst it may shatter an illusion or
two to say it, the Oscars are noto-
rious for getting it wrong as well.
Missing out key players in film his-
tory seems to be the major gaff:
Hitchcock and Kubrick both died
without being Best Director, a life-
time achievement award being the
former’s only consolation and a
minor Special Effects prize for the
latter; The Shawshank Redemp-
tion and Pulp Fiction were both
beaten to Best Picture by Forrest
Gump; and whoever nominated
Sylvester Stallone for Best Actor in
’76 alongside Robert De Niro must
be licking their wounds to this day.
Yes, there are years when the Acad-
emy just can’t get it right. And this
year wasn’t about the talent. Unless
your name is Mirren or Whittaker
that is.
Don’t get me wrong; the nomina-
tions weren’t bad. The problems
are that (a) the best of the selection
were never going to win, and (b)
the best of the year were criminally
overlooked. Besides Whitaker, The
Last King of Scotland went unno-
ticed despite winning my vote for
film of the year, filled with as many
laughs as brutal shocks (and not
like Scary Movie), closely followed
by United 93 which is conspicu-
ous in its absence from the awards
season. Too soon America? Maybe.
Xenophobia, commonly a major
problem in the Oscars with great
foreign offerings being limited to a
single Best Foreign Film category,
was reported to be AWOL this year
so I’m not sure what to blame for
Volver not making it into the foreign
category even. Shame on you Acad-
emy. Worst of all, whilst last year’s
shortlist for Best Picture contained
three great films (Crash, Capote,
Good Night and Good Luck), one
good film (Munich) and the dull and
horrendously overrated exploigay-
tion fest of Brokeback Mountain,
this year it seemed mediocrity was
the order of the day, at least in the
same category. The acting reminds
us that these people do know what
they’re talking about. It’s just the
premiership awards that show a
favour for an old friend takes prec-
edence, even when the world is
watching.
Best Picture – The Departed
This didn’t win because it was the
Best Picture. I don’t think I’ve met
anyone who was supporting it. It
won because Scorsese won. The
rule goes that Academy members
get bored by the end of the voting
sheet and so tick the same boxes in
director and picture categories, ex-
ceptions to which have only arisen
five times in the past twenty years.
One of these times was last year
and so it would have been too much
of a break with tradition to award
Scorsese then cheat him out of Best
Picture and give it to the deserved
winner, Little Miss Sunshine. This
film wasn’t groundbreaking but
neither were the others, and at
least this one was enjoyable from
start to finish. I would have happily
seen The Queen walk away with it
on the wave of Mirren fever as well
because it was so different to how
I’d imagined it. Babel was also sur-
prised me: I imagined something
worth the entrance fee and was
rewarded with sleep-inducing pap
that must have only won the ma-
jor prize at the Globes because of
the cultural diversity it showcased.
I’m glad it didn’t win here. Last up
was Letters from Iwo Jima but I’d
award Babel before I gave another
award to Oscar whore Clint East-
wood who has less integrity than
Jade Goody.
Best Director – Martin Scorsese
Scorsese had everything going for
him: The Golden Globe, the Direc-
tors Guild Award, five failed nomi-
nations already and a much better
back catalogue than this mediocre
gangster fable. That’s why he won:
sentimentality and the “oops-we-
forgot-you-earlier” syndrome. This
time they remembered before he
was dead so at least his comic ques-
tioning of the envelope contents
was better than a posthumous ac-
ceptance by wife/child/whoever.
Stand by for ovations, applause and
rewriting the “Biggest Snubs in His-
tory” books. But always remember
that Paul Greengrass should have
won for United 93.
Best Actor – Forest Whitaker
This is where the smiles start.
Forget that he’s not the lead ac-
tor, forget that James McAvoy has
been cruelly left off every shortlist
and just accept this was the right
result, no matter how many sympa-
thy votes Peter O’ Toole got for be-
ing a pervy old man playing a pervy
old man in Venus. Forest Whitaker
tore the screen to shreds with his
vicious scenes in The Last King
of Scotland and made being best
friends with a Ugandan dictator
look like a great way to spend a gap
year. Why did they overlook the film
in every other category though? I
won’t rant any longer; if you saw it,
I’m sure you agree. Don’t feel too
sorry for the others: DiCaprio will
win one day, Will Smith makes very
dubious film choices so isn’t ready
for this yet and as for Ryan Gosling,
did anyone see Half Nelson?
Best Actress – The Queen, sorry,
Helen Mirren
While the Chinese New Year tried
heralding the year of the pig, every-
one else saw it was really the year
of Mirren. Every critics’ circle in
the world gave her those gold stars
she loved (other than the Evening
Standard who sided with Dame
Judi, I’m sure Helen hasn’t lost
too much sleep though) and well-
deserved it was too. If the Royal
Family ever gets democratically
elected then Mirren will have my
vote for that too. The weird thing is
that this was a surprisingly strong
category given the clear-cut odds
offered: Penelope Cruz (Volver)
proved she should stick to Spain
rather than wallowing in Hollywood
drivel, Dame Judi Dench (Notes on
a Scandal) showed that rancorous
lesbian was just another inspired
day at the office, Kate Winslet (Lit-
tle Children) completed the Brit-
ish triptych in what I imagine was
great acting from our finest un-
der-forty actress and Meryl Streep
(The Devil Wears Prada) just nails
everything she goes into, even if
this was hardly the dramatic power
she’s flaunted in the likes of So-
phie’s Choice. Still, no-one’s steal-
ing Mirren’s light here, the true
Queen of the night.
Best Supporting Players – Alan
Arkin and Jennifer Hudson
Good to see an upset to make the
dull ceremony slightly more inter-
esting, and better it be Eddie Mur-
phy (Dreamgirls) who was pushed
to the side than the leading part
favourites. My money was on Mark
Wahlberg who managed to steal the
only acting nomination in The De-
parted next to Nicholson, DiCap-
rio, Matt Damon, Alec Baldwin and
Martin Sheen. Alan Arkin for Little
Miss Sunshine was a pleasant, if
forgettable, surprise though as I’m
not a Murphy fan. The other two,
Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond)
and Jackie Earle Haley (Little Chil-
dren), passed me by completely.
Dreamgirls did come into its own
with Jennifer Hudson. It was her
film, not Beyonce’s, and so this
award was fair, if a bit too Cinderel-
la for my liking. First acting job ever
for the girl who used to be a Burger
King salesperson and before Janu-
ary was most famous for losing in
American Idol? Hmm, I doubt she’ll
have another shot any time soon,
unlike some of the other contend-
ers. Abigail Breslin (Little Miss
Sunshine, yes the little girl) has
her whole life to act and I think this
nomination was youth sentimen-
tality unseen at the Oscars since
they awarded Anna Paquin at age
11. Now she’s in X-Men in case you
thought she’d rise and rise… Cate
Blanchett has one already and the
Babel actresses will see their dues
when they are in better films. Hud-
son won’t be holding court over the
category for years to come.
O
ther than that, it was
good to see Al Gore
taking home the
documentary prize
for global warming
flick An Inconvenient Truth, days
before critics attacked his exces-
sive energy use at home. I would
have liked to see the two screen-
play awards go the The Queen and
Notes on a Scandal but I doubt
the largely North American crowd
in the Kodak Theatre appreciated
the delicacy of the British touch as
much as I did. And Mexican cinema
got the boost it deserved, despite
Babel boring the world, as Pan’s
Labyrinth picked up a hat trick of
technical doodahs, wahey.
Soitwasn’tatotalbustonthenight
to be fair, but the winners shouldn’t
be the ones that enter the Hall of
Fame. When the time is right, The
Last King of Scotland will get con-
signed to the “great forgotten” pile
with Citizen Kane, Vertigo and The
Shining. Well maybe not, but it’ll
join a personal inventory of exhib-
its in the case against the Academy.
Don’t get me started on everything
from Europe and beyond, they won’t
understand anyway.
That’s not what the Academy is
for. It’s an ivory tower in its own
world, swelling with a sense of su-
periority. But this year, even they
must have been slightly bored by
the show they put on. If they could
even see past the ego sitting in
front.
Scorsese attempts to hide his insecurity over the size of his statuette
Cruz works the carpet while Hudson copies Mirren’s dress and pose in the hope people will remember her
