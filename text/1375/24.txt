The Felix staff would like to apologise for printing this photo. We were forced to display the picture by numbers X, 6 and 7 otherwise the
consequence was a severe case of bum cracks meet face juxtaposed with gaseous emission. We wish for forgiveness in our time of clear need
The 16-man squad were full of high
spirits and energy as they left the
RSM looking the most professional
they have ever been. Only time
would tell if this highly charismatic
band of brothers would pull off a
stunt that hasn’t been seen for 7
years.
After watching the CSM ladies
steal a victory off our own, our re-
solve was hardened and we held
our heads high as we took to the
field. The first half we played at a
nail biting pace which was matched
by the CSM.
Our steely defence of Pete, Simon,
Sam and Tim were hard to beat
and our midfield could be renamed
wholefield as they were seen in
helping out in the entirety of the
pitch. There were some stunning
runs through midfield with Sam L,
Yung and Rich F at left and right
halves passing triangles round the
Cornish folk with the centre halves,
Rich D and Mikey.
Unfortunately we did not capital-
ise on our opportunities and Cam-
borne snuck two fluky deflections
past Ade, who was playing up to his
name ‘The Cat’. Leon and Kwesi
found themselves fighting a devil-
ish battle with the CSM defence
only to be unlucky not to score.
The half time whistle went and
RSM were 2-0 down, a harsh score
line considering how even the
match had been so far. The RSM
have come back from worse situ-
ations before and they were going
to do their best to come back from
this one. As soon as the second half
started the aggression from us dou-
bled and we made many more at-
tacks into their half. Leon, Ben and
Tom did sterling work at bringing
the game to Camborne. The attack-
ing play only cut us short through
their added fitness allowing them to
break, and score.
Anthony and John gave fresh legs
to the defence, but not enough to
keep back the CSM defence. Our
defence shorts were perfect not let-
ting anything go in with Ade once
again proving himself and gained
champagne moment for a reaction
save of a drag flick. The defence
kept making powerful on-the-line
saves displaying the resolve of the
team.
Our consolation goal was made
by Pike when he carefully lofted
the ball for the Camborne defender
to guide in, beautiful tactics well
worked. The game ended 1-5, Cam-
borne having out-played us. Special
mention to Tom for brilliant stick
work and play on the ball, Man of
the Match went to Pete for stoic
defending.
The score line was a poor reflec-
tion of the game, and how hard we
had worked or how well we played.
Thank you to all who played and to
Kiran for some first class heckling
and support.
Ladies rugby team also gets kicked into touch
Ladies Rugby
RSM 1st XV 5
CSM 1st XV 15
For the second time, RSM gath-
ered together a group of dedicated,
valiant ladies ready to fight to the
death for the “Parky Bottle” (a
now formalised trophy rather than
a scrawled on milk bottle that was
used last year) against the inbred
scum that formed the CSM “wom-
en”. Unfortunately “cough-tests”
were not permitted on the CSM
team, so we could only take their
word for it that they were in fact,
women- a fact I’m still unconvinced
of.
The game began and CSM were
first to score resulting in a height-
Susie Ogilvie
ening in the game’s intensity.
Technicallyplaying“touch”rugby,
tackles became harder and head-on
collisions were rife, preventing any
extra yards being gained by either
party. Ellie Bailey spotted an open-
ing on the try line and dived forward
during a restart, causing great de-
light on our part to wipe the smug
grins off their mutated faces.
Unfortunately, they only retali-
ated harder and scored two more
tries, resulting in a 15-5 defeat for
us. A sad result after the hard work
and effort put in, but all the more
motivation to win it next year! We’re
coming for you CSM!
Luckily pride was restored later
in the evening when all the RSM
and CSM team captains fought it
out in a boat race. RSM’s experi-
enced warriors wiped the floor with
the useless CSM scum. Not that
they ever stood a chance!
Get on the deck and give me ten for losing! Then give me twenty for looking so damn happy about losing!
Felix Sport needs you!
Yes, you! Well, your sports reports at
least. Along with any more pictures of
Alice Rowlands naked that you might
have laying around. Dirty stalker.
