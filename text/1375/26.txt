a bloody nosed Simon T, the unim-
aginative Camborne team scored.
A missed kick made it 5-3 CSM at
half time.
The second half was dominated
by RSM. Playing against the wind
forced them to run more of their
possession. With some excellent ex-
tended periods of play, and fast ball
secured by everywhere flankers
Simon Jones and Rhys Cutler. The
ball was spread wide incorporat-
ing fullback Will and wing Tom on a
number of occasions, but the CSM
put up a determined defence. A
penalty awarded to RSM was with-
in striking distance, which ‘missed’
by inches as the Camborne touch
judge decided.
The RSM scrum was even more
secure with the arrival of Jovan,
and any Camborne possession was
quickly turned over with Gareths
sneaky hands. RSM continued
their pressure with great running
lines from man of the match Flan-
nan and Jovan, but could not con-
vert it into points. RSM again were
awarded a penalty for foul play in
the Camborne defensive line in
the last minute of the game. Stewy
struck it well, under immense pres-
sure, only to have the wind drag it
wide at the last second leaving CSM
to claim their first Bottle Match in
a decade.
A devastated RSM proceeded to
the union to drown theirs sorrows,
and plan their Bottle recovery mis-
sion to Camborne next year.

The match started fairly cautiously
with both teams not giving anything
away too early. The favourable wind
blowing behind the RSM was taken
advantage of, with captain and fly-
half Rob Phillipps kicking them into
a good attacking position. In the
opposition 22, the RSM tried to run
some backs crash back moves with
centres Andy D and Nathan but
were spoiled by an eager Camborne
defence. RSM continued to win safe
fast line out ball with a combination
of pin-point throwing from Charlie
and catching from Ben, which Cam-
borne could only defend against il-
legally, providing scrum-half Stewy
to step up and take the points. RSM
3-0 Camborne.
Camborne came straight back
with re-newed enthusiasm with a
series of rolling mauls which the
RSM had some trouble stopping.
However, the RSM forwards de-
fence at the fringes was solid. The
props Alex BB and Joe held strong
in the scrums even after claims of
eye gauging and ear biting had been
stubbornly ignored by the ref. Cam-
borne finally tried to spread the ball
wide where their winger was soon
denied access by Alex O’Rourke.
The referees dubious decision of a
spear tackle led to Alex spending 10
minutes in the sin bin.
The weakened RSM team was
spread even more allowing the
CSM to push hard for a try. After
a long period of defence, including
to push overs being held up, one by

What can be said apart from “shit
happens”. With the difficult task of
playing first the ladies team took
to the pitch after an encouraging
warm up session with high hopes
for the match to come against the
Camborne’s men’s…I mean..ladies
team. RSM started strong dominat-
ing possession with Ally, Conners
and, Anna getting the ball into the
CSM half.
Despite the efforts of our dedicat-
ed defenders Alice R and Gilly, we
were a goal down before we know
what happened with an illegal goal
allowed to one of the CSM dykes…I
mean players.
With our heads held high we con-
tinued on with some excellent op-
portunities created that we weren’t
able to finish although our forwards
were sweating blood for the rest of
the team. In the end 5-1 was the way
the game ended, a disappointing
score for such a hard working and
dedicated team.
Highlights of the match included
Anna’s sprint off pitch for a quick
tactical vom, Sarah managing to
trip herself up for no apparent

reason (champagne moment of
course), Sammy for killing her an-
kle and playing on (dick of the day),
Ally getting a ball to the head, and
everyone’s beautiful bloody knees...
impressive.
Although I got man of the match,
no one player stood out above an-
other, the team gave all they had
and in the end they were just better.
I would like to thank everyone who
played, it was an awesome match, a
great set up for next years annihila-
tion of CSM.
I would also like to thank the sup-
porters who could be arsed to turn
up so early to support the hock-
ey club, your abuse of CSM was
inspirational.
Although both teams were
crushed with the results, it only
showed how much the bottle match
means, and how much the hockey
club means to all of us. Oh and
thanks for the dirty pint contribu-
tions, I was truly touched to know
you would all pay £30 to see me
hammered…team love or what!
