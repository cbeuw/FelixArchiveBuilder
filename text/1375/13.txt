Amy Winehouse
Her style's not to every-
one's taste, but she does
have a unique take on
fashion. I mean that hair,
who else would go out with
that? Although I suspect
she just uses it hide mini-
bar bottles of alcohol. Or
more likely, judging from
the tabloid close-ups of
her nose, something more
illicit.
Afros
For extra cool points, carry
an afro comb in your back
pocket. If you wear this
look correctly, you should
feel like you're a character
in a 70's American sitcom.
High-Waisted Flares
Stay with the skinny or
straight leg jeans. Say no
to high-waisted flares! 1.
They make your arse look
twice it's actual size. 2.
That extra material flap-
ping around your legs is
disconcerting.
Why would you wear
trousers that drag along
puddles and shit on the
pavement? Also, hippies
wore flares in the 70's,
proof that they can only be
a bad thing.
The next look: Nordic cool
Go for a simple look with clothes that are easy to wear, not clothes that wear you
