Endurance – Police Brutality 4
Michael Cook learns how to work together to win – and how not to defuse tense hostage situations
T
he first time I played
the Auto Parts garage
on SWAT 4, in single-
player, the plan went as
follows – move in swiftly
through the roof, split the element
into two, two-man groups. One goes
along the top floor to the main ga-
rage, above the walkway. The oth-
er goes with me, down the stairs,
cleans out the car-park and wedges
the doors. They wait outside the
main garage for the final assault.
In that respect, the Endurance
run of SWAT 4 went identically,
albeit with me in a lower-ranking
position, and everyone having far
stranger accents than the butch
Americans that accompanied the
AI’s chirps of, “Get down or I put
you down!”
The difference really came when
it was time for me and my partner
to break through the door to the of-
fice and take out the perp standing
directly across the room from us. It
was simple – blow the door, shout
at the disoriented criminal, and
then tazer him. It was simple. No
AI pathfinding problems. No mis-
understood commands. Just five
humans and Voice-Over-IP com-
munications. Simple.
My partner blows the C2 charge
on the door, and it flies open, show-
ing that the target has moved since
we used our camera-sticks to check
under the door. He turns around
calmly and has a quite real pis-
tol with quite real bullets in it. My
tazer – which looks like a sellotape
dispenser – fires off prematurely
(always embarassing when you’re
in a situation like that) and thuds
into the wooden doorframe, buzz-
ing loudly as it defies everything I
learnt in Year 9 physics.
Fortunately, the door-breaching
Starsky to my Hutch has got his
primary weapon out – a pepper ball
gun, still a peashooter compared to
the Colt Python being waved at us
– and has let off several rounds into
the perp’s face. He’s screaming. It’s
a good sign.
Starsky bumbles over to handcuff
the wailing, eye-rubbing chump,
and I move slowly into the office
room, looking out of the window
that looks down into the garage.
The other half of our team is wait-
ing on that side.
There’s a shout to the left, and I
turn to see another perp on the el-
evated walkway, behind the glass.
My primary weapon is out, another
pepperball gun. No chances this
time. Pff! Pff! Pff!
The pepperballs explode on the
glass like hailstones on a barbeque,
leaving a cloud of green smog in
the office, and doing very little to
the paper-thin sheet of glass. The
magnum rounds the perp is firing,
it turns out, are far better at pen-
etrating glass. As well as fibreglass.
And skull.
So began the seven-hour jog
through the most recent outing of
the tactical criminal-punching sim-
ulator SWAT 4. It was expected to
be the shortest Endurance run to
date, since each mission only took
around fifteen minutes to complete,
and the two teams of five were ex-
pected to get extremely high end-
of-mission ratings straight off the
mark. After the 51% report for the
Auto Parts mission, things began to
change.
It was the diamond merchant’s
hostage rescue where things really
began to go downhill. After three
attempts at the mission, all ending
in either the execution of a hostage
or – more amusingly – the complete
gutting of the team by a single shot-
gun-wielding attacker, our team’s
leader began to change his tactics.
We all started with our usual load-
out – CS Gas, heavy armour, non-
lethal weapons. But someone had
an AK-47.
Whoops.
After a few restarts, mostly involv-
ing either tazering the rogue SWAT
member into submission, or every-
one getting slaughtered, terrorist
stereotype-style, we managed to
group together and progress past
the mission – not without half of the
team getting shot first, but it was
completed either way.
It turned out that missions were
notdestinedtobefive-minutejaunts
after all, and an estimated two-hour
finish time rapidly increased as
plans gave way to shooting which
gave way to gas grenade fights. By
the time we’d started playing the
missions properly again, we’d had
to merge the two teams together
due to dropouts, and found our-
selves hopelessly stuck just a few
missions from the end.
Single-player runs such as Deus
Ex, or more recently, Hitman: Blood
Money, were just a matter of plod-
ding through a long enough story at
your own pace. Hitman picked up a
competitive element once the play-
ers got talking to each other, but
SWAT 4 was a different challenge.
All you needed to do to complete
the game was to keep the players
focused, and keep concentrating on
plans. But with the team at varying
levels of inebriation, and problems
with the way the server was set up,
it was easier said than done.
The final, beautiful moment came
in the last mission when, after half
an hour of frustrating cock-ups and
self-imposed civilian executions,
the team decided to shirk their soft-
ly-softly approach, ditch the bean-
bag-firing shotguns, and take some
real weapons. A SWAT 4 element,
all with Magnums, storming a con-
troversial research laboratory, with
self-given orders to shoot first and
take no prisoners later.
Like a crazy black ops team from
some awful faux-action TV series,
the Englishman, the Irishman,
the Scotsman and the Northerner
stumbled through the eerie spot-
lights and explosive gas canisters,
headshotting and door-kicking like
it was Counterstrike on steroids.
After an evening of cock-ups and
subtlety, it was a beautiful end.
Single-player might have depth,
but it doesn’t have heavily-armed
Yorkshiremen.
Radio Chatter
EDDIE – Pick it.
ANDREW – Someone else pick it,
I’ve got the gas out.
MIKE – I’ll pick it.
(Mike begins to pick the lock.)
ANDREW – Is there a way to put
a grenade away after you’ve got
ready to throw it?
EDDIE – Right-
MIKE – … you mean after you’ve
taken the pin out?
ANDREW – Yeah.
MIKE – …
EDDIE – Alright, look, I’ll secure
the right hand of the room. Mike
and James I want you to secure
the left. Uh … Mike I want you to
secure the stairs, but don’t go up
‘em.
MIKE – Alright.
EDDIE – Okay guys.
MIKE – Wait, did you mean … no,
don’t worry.
EDDIE – Okay, go.
There is the sound of gunshots,
and shouting of “Police! Drop
your weapons!”
EDDIE – Fucking hell, Mike!
MIKE – What?
EDDIE – You block every door
we go through!
MIKE – You said to go first!
EDDIE – Alright, whatever, look
I want gas in the middle of that
room. Can’t see fuck all in it. An-
drew and Mike, go around and go
through the other door.
(They go)
JAMES – Already got gas ready.
ANDREW – I’ll breach it.
EDDIE – Okay, go.
MIKE – On your command.
EDDIE – I SAID GO.
MIKE – …
EDDIE – GO.
The sound of a breaching charge
being set off, and someone swear-
ing over TeamSpeak.
EDDIE – Mike, for fuck’s sake! I
SAID GO.
MIKE – It’s locked, I’m picking
it.
ANDREW – It’s not locked.
MIKE – … ah. See I unlocked it,
but then it said it was still locked,
so...
EDDIE – What the hell do you
call that?!
MIKE – Look, I …
ANDREW – The next room looks
clear.
EDDIE – Alright, one room left.
ANDREW – This is the last room,
I think.
EDDIE – Yeah, I just said, it’s …
MIKE – You want flash?
EDDIE – Look, everyone just
shut up, and I can give you the or-
der. Alright? Alright. Now we’ve
got a door open at the end of that
corridor … Go wedge the door.
MIKE – Alright, I’ve got a wedge.
EDDIE – No, it’s alright. I want
someone to cover me as we go
in.
ANDREW – Alright.
EDDIE – Okay, look – perp! Hang
on, we’ve got a perp. Fall back. Go
open the door, I’ll take him.
MIKE – Unlocking now.
EDDIE – Go quickly. Go. Wedge
on this door.
ANDREW – Shouldn’t we go in
the other way?
EDDIE – I said WEDGE ON
THAT DOOR.
ANDREW – Ah, I haven’t got
one.
MIKE – Me neither.
ANDREW – I thought you said
you did?
MIKE – Yeah, I thought I had, but
… I don’t.
EDDIE – Oh for fuck’s sake …
“I don’t want any fuck-ups” was the catchphrase of the night. Though in all seriousness, it’s probably a well-used phrase in real counter-terrorist police operations, too
