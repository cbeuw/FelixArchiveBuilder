tory, a heavy burden of expectation
was lain upon the broad shoulders
of new and rather dashing RSM
squash captain Flannan O’Mahony
and his elite band of athletic pala-
dins. In the near palatial surround-
ings of the Wilson House rec-
reation centre in Paddington, the
RSM drew first blood through long
haired fresher no. 2, Landy, who
I’m confused, where is the car?

smoothly commanded a straight
set destruction of his inbred coun-
terpart. Geochemist Alexander
O’Rourke quickly followed suit,
galloping about the court with the
power of a steroid loaded ox and
the grace of a young Baryshnikov
to claim another resounding 3-0
victory. O’Mahony kept the winning
culture alive with a swift thrashing
of the Cambourne captain, and so it
fell to veteran legend of the arena
George Hutson to do his duty in
usurping the Cambourne no 2. He
coolly obliged, effortlessly working
his opponent about the court before
delivering the sharp, clinical blow
of defeat upon the hapless Cor-
nish miner. The last match was to
be the most keenly competed, and

It took RSM until late the next day to realise that squash is infact the only sport that matters
a herculean effort from supremely
talented long haired fresher no. 1
Phil was enough to quash a brief
but spirited Cambourne revival,
thus completing an emphatic 5-0
whitewash. The RSM players and
supporters, giddy with the elation
of victory, stood proud, the dejected
Cambourne contingent left broken,
dispirited and desolate.
