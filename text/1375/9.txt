How will your voice be heard?
RCSU nominations are now open. Felix talks you through the positions and explains why you should stand
T
he Royal College of Sci-
ence Union has been
making the headlines
in Felix quite a lot re-
cently. What with the
Science Challenge, Ritz event and
office fiasco, it has been cementing
itself as a force to be reckoned with
in the Union.
Nominations are now open for the
RCSU officer positions. If you want
to represent students, organise
events, fight campaigns or decide
how thousands of pounds should
be spent, then you should consider
standing.
To help you to decide what would
suit you best, here is a description
of a few of the positions available,
written by those who currently hold
them.
President
The president is ultimately respon-
sible for kicking the engineers’
arses, and making sure the med-
ics know their place. There’s lots of
organising to do too, but you’ll get
your name in Wikipedia and also on
a leaky tankard. Don’t stand unless
you’re really serious about it - the
RCSU has come along a huge way
this year, and if we’re not even bet-
ter next year, you’ll have me to an-
swer to...
Honorary Secretary
Well it sounds a bit dull, and yes you
do have to type up minutes every
week, but Hon. Sec. is a really fun
all-round role. Not having as many
direct responsibilities as the other
officers means you can pick and
chose what to get involved in, plus
you’re the one who gets to disci-
pline the President!
Vice President (Operations)
The VPO is quite a diverse role
within the RCSU. It’s mostly be-
hind-the-scenes work, like looking
after the departmental societies
and their finances, promoting com-
munication with Wye and Silwood,
representing the RCSU at Union
meetings, and helping to organise
the Science Careers Fair. A major
part of my year was organising Sci-
ence Challenge as I secured sub-
stantial sponsorship and organised
the Imperial competition.
Vice President (Activities)
The VPA’s responsibilities are or-
ganising large scale events, such as
the Freshers’ Ball and RCSU RAG
Week. I am also involved in mas-
cotry, regalia, Alumni relations, and
the infamous Freshers’ Yard con-
test. The new VPA, whoever they
may be, should have excellent or-
ganisational skills, an appreciation
of the traditions of the RCSU and be
tall, dark and handsome.
Welfare Officer
If you care about the students of the
RCSU and want to be the official
student condom dispenser then you
should apply for the Welfare Officer
position! You need to be available to
talk to students: I strongly recom-
mend being available for weekly
surgeries. You will represent the
students views in committees like
the Representation and Welfare
Board. At the start of the year you
will settle-in the freshers by coordi-
nating the buddy scheme.
Sports Officer
The role of the sports officer is to fa-
cilitate sports within the RCSU. In
other words the sports officer must
be able to tempt people away from
the union bar and into sport. The
sports officer comes into contact
with large amounts of the student
population so the ability to deal
with people is a must, as is time
management. As for other skills,
reliability, organisation and persist-
ence are fundamental.
Academic Affairs Officer
The Academic Affairs Officer may
not sound the most glamorous of
jobs, but it’s one of the most im-
portant positions in the RCSU. You
will be responsible for ensuring
that the four thousand undergradu-
ates have the facilities they need
in order to study effectively and
efficiently. This is your chance to
make changes which will improve
the manner in which courses are
run. In reality this means you’ll sit
in on many meetings (mostly with
free lunches), most at a high level
(including Union Council), and try
and sway decisions your way.
Events Officer
Events Officer is a job for people
who are organised, fun and socia-
ble, including organising a range
of events for Fresher’s week and
throughout the year, like bar nights,
pub crawls, club nights, buddies
events, RAG events... Well the list
is endless and it’s basically up to
you to provide organised fun events
that appeal to a very diverse union.
This job is for people with an imagi-
nation and an ability to get people
together. Good Luck and enjoy!
Publicity and Web Comm.
The publicity officers are respon-
sible for publicising and promot-
ing the many RCSU events during
the year. What’s involved? Well,
poster design, sticking up posters,
updating the website with the lat-
est announcements, sports results,
events info, making design changes
if needed, and generally organising
publicity pushes. After a big public-
ity push it is very satisfying being
part of a very successful event.
Broadsheet Editor
Broadsheet is a glossy magazine
of 12 to 24 pages of news from the
faculty, produced twice per term.
The editor’s job is to collect the ma-
terial, construct the issue, and get
it printed. The editor also puts to-
gether the RCSU Freshers’ Hand-
book over the summer.
Departmental Representative
(by the current Physics Rep)
Physics Departmental Representa-
tive is responsible for all the impor-
tant things: proper elections and
representation from Year Reps,
Physics Staff Student committee,
UCAS tours, some fresher’s events,
the buddy scheme. Oh and definite-
ly one of the perks is getting to sit on
the Physics safety committee and
hear about the accidents that hap-
pened in the physics department.
Other positions available are:
Honorary Junior Treasurer, Mas-
ters Rep and Postgrad Research
Rep.
Not into science? CGCU nominations are open
E
ngineers unite! Now is
the time to follow in the
footsteps of your forefa-
thers and stand for elec-
tion in the CGCU com-
mittee elections. Are you the next
James Fok, Nick Simpson, Tristan
Sherliker or Ashley Brown?
Here’s what the current holders
of some positions had to say about
what they’ve been doing this year.
President
As President, I planned events for
fresher’s week withthe rest of
That’s some big boots to fill
the Committee number, culminat-
ing in the Fresher’s Ball. We have
also organised a mince pie party,
paintballing trip, bar nights – the
list goes on. On a serious note,
running the union is not just about
fun and keeping the students away
from their books You also repre-
sent them academically and must
ensure that their welfare is looked
after. There are dedicated officers
for each of the above.
Vice President (Finance and Socs)
My role as the Vice President of Fi-
nance and Societies is to take care
of the pot of money we have each
year and ensure we all get the most
out of it.
I also help out with any prob-
lems societies might have, and
assist anyone who might want
to set up a new one.
Vice President (Activities)
As Vice President (Activities)
it is my privilege and respon-
sibility to organise the various
social events we put on for the
students.
I’ve been involved in the Buddy
Schemes, the Lord Mayor’s Show
and the Internship Centre; but also
in organising bar nights in the Un-
ion, paintballing, football, a sports
day, the infamous egg race and
many more.
Honorary Secretary
As the incoming Honorary Secre-
tary I will spend the following year
documenting everything CGCU
does. Unfortunately for me we
have a long agenda of activities and
events!
I also have the responsibility of
arranging your Fresher’s Dinner.
Every year the Fresher’s Din-
ner grows and if you take on this
role you’ll be responsible for mak-
ing sure it is even better than this
year’s.
Academic Affairs Officer
Academic representation plays a
key role in ensuring that the aca-
demics and facilities are adapted to
the needs of the students, and are
befitting of an institution such as
Imperial College.
I ensure that the dep reps (see
below) do their job and that the aca-
demic representation is organised
and “up-to-scratch”. I also work
with ICU and IC faculty at a higher
level to ensure that the courses are
tailored to the needs of taught stu-
dents (undergrad & MSc students).
Departmental Representative
The way the academic representa-
tion structure for the Engineering
Faculty works is that each depart-
ment has a departmental repre-
sentative commonly known as a
Dep Rep. They are elected to han-
dle all academic and welfare mat-
ters in the department, to ensure
that these are taken seriously by
the staff and that they are resolved
either at a departmental level or
taken to CGCU.
