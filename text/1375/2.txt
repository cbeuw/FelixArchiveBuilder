JCR breakfasts
“I am one of the select staunch
supporters of the ‘fry-up’ breakfast
since its glory days as the ‘All Day
Breakfast’ in the JCR. My diet of
two fried eggs, four hash browns
and baked beans saw me through
many a lecture.”

BASICALLY THIS WEEK’S SPORT
Elections 2007: uhm, no results yet
Election results were not an-
nounced as anticipated on Thurs-
day evening, leaving many (includ-
ing the candidates) questioning
when they will be available.
The initial complaints
A complaint was initially made
against the Returning Officer, John
Collins (who looks after the whole
election, and is supposed to make
sure it is run in a fair and unbiased
manner). The complaint seems to
have been made in response to a
post a candidate made on Live! (the
online CGCU newspaper). The post
insinuated that Mr Collins had not
been entirely truthful in his com-
munications with candidates.
Shortly afterwards, Mr Collins
sent an email to the candidate in
question, which included language
that implied that disciplinary action
would be recommended against
the candidate. The candidate then
asked for the post to be removed.
It seems that this candidate felt
discriminated against by Mr Col-
lins for this and other reasons, and
therefore filed a complaint. Other
complaints against Mr Collins
were also discussed by the Execu-
tive, who met in closed session last
Thursday (which means the media
had no access to the proceedings)
to discuss them. Felix is not privy to
the details of the complaints.
Secrecy
At the closed session, Mr Collins
presented his defence against the
allegations of bias. However, Exec
voted to remove him as Returning
Officer with immediate effect.
John appears to have taken the
decision very badly, and was later
seen in the Quad haranguing at
least one member of the five-strong
Exec with expletives.
Up until Tuesday this week, the
candidates had no idea what had
occurred, as the meeting had taken
place in closed session. They were
not aware Mr Collins had been re-
moved as Returning Officer for
alleged bias, or that Eric Lai had
taken over the role for the time be-
ing. An email was received by all
candidates reminding them to send
campaign material for approval
to elections@imperial.ac.uk only,
rather than copying Mr Collins in
(as had previously happened).
Neither the removed Returning
Officer nor Mr Lai would reveal any
facts about what occurred; the de-
tails were not made public until the
Court Chair, Hamish Common, was
involved.
The long arm of the Court
Mr Collins was clearly very un-
happy with the decision, and was
apparently offered the chance to
reconvene Exec to discuss the
complaint again rather than pos-
sibly hold up the election. Felix can
only assume he rejected this offer,
as the newly-created Union Court
has been dragged into play.
An oddity of this situation is that
Mr Collins is not the one who made
the appeal to Court; instead, the ap-
peal was made by Jad Marrouche,
RSCU President, who was not
present at the Exec meeting and
has so far stayed relatively clear of
central Union politics. Mr Collins
has been spotted discussing the
matter in the RSCU office recently.
The Court has been asked to de-
cide if the decision to remove John
Collins as Returning Officer was
constitutional. The appeal centres
on four points; insufficient time to
consider the issue, conflicts of in-
terest by members of Exec, rele-
vant evidence unavailable, and pro-
cedural irregularities (otherwise
known as poor quality hackery).
Mr Collins apparently convened
the meeting himself, which lasted
for more than three hours, casting
doubts on the first point. It is true
that Exec members faced conflicts

of interest, having seconded or
otherwise supported one or more
candidate in the sabbatical and/or
NUS elections. However, even if
more members of Exec had been
present, almost all would have
faced this conflict.
Why call the Court?
If the Court decides it was not con-
stitutional for Exec to remove Mr
Collins as Returning Officer, then
this does not remove any claim of
bias against Mr Collins; rather, it
forces Exec to meet to discuss the
complaint again, and decide if the
allegations of bias are valid.
Why John Collins has not ap-
pealed directly to Council, the su-
preme body of the Union, remains
unknown. A new Exec may well
make the same decision.
So what does this all mean?
Election results will be delayed. For
how long, no-one knows. Before
results can be announced, all the
candidates must sign a declaration
which says that the election is free
and fair. So far, very few sabbatical
candidates have signed it.
Candidates approached by Felix
who had not signed the declara-
tion said that they either had out-
standing complaints that had not
been resolved (such as a Felix Edi-
tor candidate who has seen some-
one systematically removing their
posters) or that they felt it was
not appropriate while the status
of the Returning Officer was still
undetermined.
A complete farce
It appears the candidates are some-
what disillusioned by the process as
well. Felix has approached each of
the candidates for comment. “This
sorry debacle has had no effect on
the outcome whatsoever and even
if he [Collins] feels wronged he
should just stop whinging and take
one for the team to preserve the in-
tegrity of what were, on the whole,
hassle free elections,” said one
candidate, who wished to remain
anonymous. Another candidate
found the elections to be somewhat
less than satisfactory: “The whole
thing was a complete fucking sham-
bles,” adding that he had signed the
declaration but he regretted doing
so. One candidate referred to the
election as “the most farcical I’ve
seen in my time at Imperial.” Most
candidates have expressed unhap-
piness with the hustings, one call-
ing it “a complete and unmitigated
farce”. Some candidates expressed
dissatisfaction with Mr Collins’ role
as Returning Officer, one citing his
apparent inability to keep his anger
in check, though recognising that
being RO is a difficult task.
The future
Though all this farcical to-ing and
fro-ing will probably have little ef-
fect on the election results, it has
done little to improve the Union’s
public face.
