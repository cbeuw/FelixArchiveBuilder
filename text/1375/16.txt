I
f you’re looking for games
that won’t kill the sluggish
excuse for a PC you’ve got
running MatLab at home, or
you’ve played as much Soli-
taire as a (wo)man can reasonably
take, then you’ll be looking for some
fresh multiplayer options. Felix has
just the ticket for you.
Obviously there are many many
games that could be in this list,
and hopefully will as we progress
through the weird world of online
games.
However, due to space and prac-
ticality constraint, we’re going to
take it a few steps at a time. This
week, we look at some of the true
classics of the gaming scene.
Off in search of the second player

Warcraft 3: The Frozen Throne:
Defence Of The Ancients
Real-time strategy mod
Hooray for having the longest name
in this list! If you are Malaysian or
Singaporean you probably already
have this on your PC. Even with-
out consciously installing it. For
those new to the World of Warcraft
3 mods, DOTA is a downloadable
map in which up to 10 players can
roam and fight as heroes.
The basic routine is start, kill
weak little creatures and/or other
heroes, destroy enemy buildings;
with the ultimate goal being the de-
struction of the other team’s monu-
ment. It’s an addictive and incred-
ibly fun cycle, with much room for
teamwork and tactical play. The
only drawback, however, is that
your enjoyment largely depends on
who you’re playing with.
Keep in mind that DOTA is con-
stantly being updated and you will
need to manually download new
versions from time to time. There
really is no excuse for not having
this. Its as demanding as a very
small undemanding thing, and
should run comfortably on any com-
puter made in the last 5 years.
If you’ve already gotten your
teeth into DOTA, check out our in-
depth exploration of the mod this
week, too.

F.E.A.R Combat
First-person shooter
Imagine a bowl of Counterstrike,
garnished with some Quake, and
then topped-off with some delicious
Unreal sauce. And imagine not pay-
ing for it. F.E.A.R Combat is the free
multiplayer version of the 2005 hit
shooter F.E.A.R.
You get the usual multiplayer
modes, Deathmatch, TeamDeath-
match, Capture the Flag, etc., but
what sets F.E.A.R apart from other
shooters is its style. Firefights are
hectic and enormously fun, with de-
bris and bits of furniture flying all
over the screen. Each game is fast
and RSI-inducingly furious, with a
melee attack complementing the
array of projectile weapons.
The only downside is that some
matches can get too chaotic for
their own good, resulting in players
being blown up just as you respawn.
However this usually only happens
with lots of players in a small map.
The graphics are up to date yet
quite scalable.
It should run on most PCs from
the last 3 years or so – but be wary
of hardware conflicts, and keep
those drivers up to date..

CounterStrike
First-person shooter
This is probably famous enough
that I don’t need to say anything
about it. So I won’t.
For the sake of this article, how-
ever, I’ll simply say that this is quite
possibly the most famous multi-
player FPS, and that you can’t go
wrong with any version starting
from 1.3 all the way to Source.
Although the modern day ‘terror-
ist versus counter-terrorist’ setting
may or may not appeal to you, the
pure, distilled gameplay should.
The game has been fine tuned
and will probably run on just about
any computer you dare stick it on
– though a good internet connectio
is always a bonus, particularly if
playing through Steam.
As with many multiplayer games,
the bane of CS is the behaviour of
its players. Expect campers. Lots of
them. And not the tent kind either.
CounterStrike is free online in
some places, but the latest version
is available for a modest sum at
http://www.steampowered.com
Trackmania
Racer/platformer/awesome hybrid
Trackmania is a completely ber-
serk racing game in which you can
create your own lunatic tracks or
race on any of the premade tracks
bundled with the game. The con-
trols are simple, but the same can’t
be said for the actual racing.
You’ll have to navigate through
unimaginable tracks, with all man-
ner of loops and jumps, and perform
crazy stunts at incredible speed. It’s
good fun as a network game with a
couple of friends, and even more
fun when some people get together
and race their created tracks.
Several flavours of Trackmania
are available. There’s the complete-
ly free Trackmania Nations, or the
newly released Trackmania United.
Both games are quite light and will
work well on any toaster/PC.
TM Nations is free online at
http://www.trackmanianations.
com/
TM United is available cheaply
online or, if you’re lucky, on the high
street.
That’s it for this week! If you want

The weirder, the better!
