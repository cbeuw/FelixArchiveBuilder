Next year’s President will be
________________, in a shock/pre-
dictable result. S/he won by a huge
landslide/gnat’s genitalia, with ___
_ votes compared to nearest rival,

dent will be the slate candidate / a
scot / a current sabbatical / a girl
/ a joke.

dents proved somewhat more/less
interesting. For Deputy President
(Education & Welfare), __________

ing __________ in second place.

Societies), the slate suffered a de-
feat/trounced the opposition. This

Candidates who work for Felix sweep the board at this year’s
elections, leaving the Union in complete shock and awe
tions to all the candidates who
weren’t elected, and those who
were but don’t know it yet.
N.B. This copy of Felix is
interactive; feel free
to fill it in when (and
if) results are an-
nounced. The first
correct copy deliv-
ered to the Felix of-
fice will earn the
bearer the prince-
ly sum of £20.

A Fender Pixalator guitar on display at the “Harrods Rocks”
exhibition in Knightsbridge. Security has been tight around
the store over the last week as various vintage guitars arrived,
including the first Fender Stratocaster ever made. The attempt
to break the world record for most guitarists jamming together
had to be cancelled after local residents expressed concern over
the noise levels.
