couldn’t wait to start running had
arrived just before 10:30 and an
hour later dB’s was full of students
who had arrived from all over the
UK. T-shirts were selling well and
there was a huge buzz in anticipa-
tion of the two o’clock start.
Tony Watts, one of the three or-
ganisers of the very first HPR, got
the men’s race underway at 2:00
prompt. Tony also started the wom-
en’s race five minutes later. Soon
enough, the first runners had fin-
ished their legs and the races. In
the meantime, the committee were
ensuring that everything was run-
ning smoothly. Some of the commit-
teewerepreparingthepresentation
and food; others were transporting
cups of tea and coffee to the many
marshals, whilst a few were seen
to be helping the officials with the
results and time-keeping.
After the race, some of the com-
petitors visited Ethos to have a
quick shower, some were seen
to be in the JCR picking up some
free food, whilst the winners of the
races decided to go home! The
men’s/mixed race was won by
St Mary’s University College in
a time of 98 minutes 54 seconds.
Nottingham University finished
as runners up whilst 14AC (Not-
tingham University Old Boys)
took third place.
The foreign competition was
won by the Dutch University
Squad, whilst first guest team
was 14AC. The reigning internal
champions, Beit Hall, success-
fully managed to defend their ti-
tle - they completed the race
in a time of 118 minutes 44
seconds. The next internal
team was ETA Unknown
(125 minutes 39 seconds)
whilst Wilson House were
the third best internal
team (128 minutes 42
seconds). The fastest
internal individuals
were Eoin O Colgain (17 minutes 43
seconds), Ed Pitt Ford (18 minutes
41 seconds), and Robert Done (18
minutes 42 seconds).
The women’s race was won by Bir-
mingham University in a time of 47
minutes 28 seconds. The runner up
spot was taken by St Mary’s Univer-
sity College, whilst Sheffield Hallam
University claimed third place. The
Dutch University Squad and 14AC
both completed a double by win-
ning the women’s foreign and guest
team competition respectively. The
internal women’s competition was
won by CivEng Revenge in a time
of 56 minutes and 39 seconds. The
next internal team was Beit Hall
(62 minutes 37 seconds) and the
third best internal team was Girls
Abound Improved
(62 minutes 46 sec-
onds). The fastest
internal individu-
als were Harriet
Scott (11 minutes
38 seconds), Hi-
lary Dyer (13
minutes 15
seconds)
and Sara
Al-Kah-
midi (13 minutes 22
seconds).
However, the most
important prizes were
the wooden spoons
(and lots of alcohol)!
Inthemen’s/mixed
these were given
to Beit Hall
S3 Warriors,
whilst in the
women’s race,
the prize was
(rather surprisingly)
given to Ecole Central Paris.
After the prize giving ceremony
the committee swiftly cleaned up
the JCR, whilst the competitors
went back home (or to the gym/
Ethos) to make themselves look
beautiful. It took a while for me to
get there, but when the race or-
ganiser finally got to dB’s (at about
10:00) the party was well and truly
pumping! There was an estimated
crowd of about 600 people; it was so
busy that even some of the sabbs
were seen working behind the bar!
But there was still another famous
contest to be completed – the Boat
Race. There were many teams
lined up side by side (too many for
me to remember), but the boat race
was swiftly won by Manchester
University, whilst Imperial beat the
Imperial Old Boys to claim those
ever so vital bragging rights! The
party was, once again, a fantastic
night and it definitely lived up to its
reputation of being one of the most
popular and successful nights for
the union.
I would like to thank everyone
who competed in the event for turn-
ing up and making the day such a
memorable one in the college’s
centenary year. The HPR commit-
tee would also like to thank Impe-
rial College, ICU, College Catering,
Security, St Johns Ambulance, The
Royal Parks, the timekeepers and
results team, and all the marshals.
There is also a special mention for
Kristine Rajamanikam whose ad-
vice and experience was particular-
ly helpful at the times of need and to
Aziz Bilgrami who helped with tak-
ing in entry forms. Without the help
of all of these people, the day would
not have run as smoothly as it did.
If you enjoyed the HPR and would
like to take up running (whether it
is competitive or recreational) then
why not contact the Cross Country
Club at run@imperial.ac.uk There
are women only running sessions,
circuit training sessions and track
sessions for any athletes out there.
The training sessions are for indi-
viduals of ALL abilities.
I hope to see you at one of our
training sessions!
