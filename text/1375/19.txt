IC’s largest student sporting event
Relay organiser Rakesh Nandha writes about organising IC’s largest student sporting event
P
reparations for the 2007
Hyde Park Relays (HPR)
had started on a beautiful
summer’s afternoon in
May 2006, when the new-
ly-elected committee of the ICU
Cross Country Club met up to dis-
cuss the event. We had established
that over the summer, we ought to
have secured sponsorship for the
event – a stumbling block for most
organisers – but met with success
by this one. By the start of term a
race permit had been obtained,
and by December formal invites to
teams from across Britain and Eu-
rope had been sent. The prepara-
tions for Imperial College’s largest
student sporting event were well
underway! (Yes, that’s right: the
Hyde Park Relays is bigger than
the Varsity matches!)
The massive task for the
organising committee was
to promote the event within
Imperial College. Although
most students and staff know
about the relays, it was still very
critical to ensure that freshers
knew about the race. Over
Christmas, there were whis-
pers across campus of the
HPR, but we needed to get
a full-blown message out
ASAP! A number of differ-
ent methods were tried,
including practicing
the race route, ad-
vertising on Fa-
cebook, setting
up stalls
across
campus
and even
placing a
banner in
the JCR. However, I think the single
most important way was good old-
fashioned postering and flyering! In
the run up to deadline day, I’m sure
you couldn’t walk around campus
without seeing a HPR poster.
Preparations for the committee
really kicked off when our foreign
friends arrived. 45 Poles overran
the campus on the Wednesday be-
fore the race, with 17 Germans and
88 Dutch arriving the following day!
This was when the hard work re-
ally started for the committee. For
the next couple of nights,
committee members
would have the privi-
lege of “sleeping” (if
you can call it that)
against the hard cold
floors of the Union
Gym, Union Concert
Hall, and Main Dining
Hall. Of course,
there was plen-
ty of drinking
involved in the
union (for guests as
well as the committee),
which was usually fol-
lowed up by pain-
ful headaches
the following
morning.
Alarm
bells on the
race day were
heard as early as
6:00 a.m. as race day
preparations began
with collecting bread,
setting up the union
for registration and
setting up the JCR for
the prize giving/recep-
tion. Those who really
