An open challenge to the sceptics
I
n the many discussions I have
had on Islam, there seems
to be an underlying concept
with those out of “the fold” –
that a belief in Islam is inher-
ently irrational and ultimately due
to the unexplainable, fervent zeal of
past-dead generations. Further, it is
even more baffling that this belief is
making a resurgence. More Mus-
lims are practising than ever before,
and more people are still becoming
Muslim. A mere few years ago I
was just another semi/non-prac-
tising Muslim, bored with strange,
alien and ultimately “weird” beliefs
in the face of the Enlightenment’s
glory. Today I am more observant
and at ease with the liberation of
Islam than ever before.
The crux of the issue is this; how
do we know that a self-professed
prophet is truly from God? It is sim-
ple – we challenge him on a miracle.
The following is Islam’s miracle:
“And if you (mankind) are in
doubt concerning that which We
have sent down [the Qur’an] to Our
slave Muhammad (peace be upon
him) then produce a chapter of the
like thereof and call your witnesses
[supporters and helpers] besides
Allah, if you are truthful”
(Author: God, The Qur’an, chap-
ter 2, verse 23)
If Muhammed was just a man, an-
other politician grabbing at power
Examing the Qu’ran in a critical, literary fashion – does it prove itself to be “inimitable”? Does the
construction of the Arabic text reveal the presence of a divine hand?
with a (more than usual?) masterful
plan, then surely his genius can be
matched with the collective effort of
humanity? What I want to show you
is why Muslims regard the Qur’an
as a piece of literary excellence,
something that is totally inimitable
by man, and thus miraculous. It is a
proof that you may wish to disagree
with, but it is rational, and so the
belief is based upon reason. It is not
arbitrary or inherited.
First of all, what is Arabic poetry?
Arabic poetry is a form of metrical
speech with a rhyme. This rhyme is
achieved by every line of the poem
ending upon a specific letter. The
metrical aspect comes in when you
can divide the Arabic up into differ-
ent divisions (called in Arabic ‘al-bi-
har’ or ‘the seas’) according to the
pattern of short or long syllables
used in the line (with some vari-
ance allowed). This was codified
in the 8th Century by al-Khalili bin
Ahmed and there are 16 distinct,
separate seas. If there is a verse of
poetry not in these 16 seas, then it
is either prose, or it is not Arabic.
There is no other way to construct
the Arabic languge.
From a purely objective and struc-
tural view, the Qur’an does not fall
into any of the categories above, be
they prose or rhymed. Some chap-
ters contain some elements of the
above rhyming seas, yet the style
may switch quickly and smoothly to
prose. Thus, when a chapter is eval-
uated as a whole, it is not possible
to ascertain its literary form. The
Qur’an therefore defines its own
literary genre, with its own unique
form that has surpassed attempts
by any other to come close to imi-
tating it. Such a peculiarity does not
arise when evaluating any other lit-
erary work on the planet.
You may think that God would
have spent too much time to make
the message aesthetically pleasing
to have actually left any wisdom in
it. Yet the Qur’an brings a huge re-
lief and wisdom to the struggles of
life when applied in a sincere and
proper (not perverted) manner. All
this from an illiterate forty year old
man with no history of being a liar.
No person, orientalist or eastern,
has challenged that fact that prior
to the Qur’an, Mohammed was
more inclined to asceticism and
abandoning the world, rather than
persuading anyone about anything.
Both western and eastern schol-
ars recognized the evident inimi-
tability of the Qur’an. The Scottish
Orientalist Hamilton Gibb said that
“with remarkable boldness and self
confidence Muhammad appealed
as a supreme confirmation of his
mission to the Qur’an itself. Like
all Arabs they were connoisseurs
of language and rhetoric. Well, then
if the Qur’an were his own compo-
sition other men could rival it. Let
them produce ten verses like it. If
they could not, and it is obvious that
they could not, then let them accept
Omar Hashmi
the Qur’an as an outstanding evi-
dential miracle”
(Islam: A Historical Survey. Ox-
ford University Press, p. 28)
Historically too, we can see that
the challenge has never been met.
Those who knew classical Arabic
the best were the Arabs of Mo-
hammed’s time. Their attempts
at immitating the Qur’an are well
documented. Examples such as
Musaylimah the liar and al-Muqaf-
fa’ are just two of many people who
wanted Islam to be neutralised.
There have been no acceptable imi-
tations, and how can we expect to
do any better now with less knowl-
edge of the language comparred to
back then (though I’m sure more
people want to try).
So, if you want to try to copy it,
then please do so! The shortest
chapter in the Qur’an is three lines,
so just try and copy three lines. It
cant be haram (forbidden), because
Dear Sir,
Like many other students, I am one
of the select staunch supporters of
the ‘fry-up’ breakfast since its glory
days as the ‘All Day Breakfast’ in
the JCR. My diet of two fried eggs,
four hash browns and baked beans
saw me through many a lecture,
well fed, satisfied and ready to face
any challenges ahead
Having seen various re-branding
strategies imposed upon this most
legendary of college feasts, I have
witnessed drastic changes, such as
restricting breakfast serving times
till 10:30am (not a civilised time by
this student’s calculations), and
the move of venue from the JCR,
via the MDH, to the SCR. This last
move, instigated since the start of
isn’t Allah asking you to do it? So
please do try, and whatever you
come up with I will diligently for-
ward to every scholar/academy I
can find. If they can’t reply to you,
then I will push them to accept that
the book can be forged. However,
we have been holding our breath
against intellectuals and linguists
for 1400 years, and I don’t anticipate
that it will stop.
I can promise you that far from
the Muslim community being out-
raged at the audacity of the chal-
lenge, they will respect those who
are sincere enough to search for
higher Truths.
Every time there is propaganda
against Islam, its simply increases
the Muslim motivation for dialogue.
Go on, wake the sleeping giant.

the new term, has been particularly
infuriating: we are expected to en-
ter a fantastic room used by college
staff, postgraduates, visitors and
prospective students, purchase
our breakfast and swiftly remove
ourselves to the JCR where we un-
kempt and dishevelled undergradu-
ates can gnaw at black pudding to
our heart’s content. We are but
common students, why should the
serving staff in the SCR be nice to
us?
Not all the enforced changes have
been bad. For instance, the deci-
sion to play Heart FM’s ‘80s and
‘90s cheese throughout breakfast
time in the MDH was greeted with
enthusiasm, but sadly cannot be
continued upstairs in the SCR. The
loyalty card scheme, which promis-
es a free breakfast for every 9 pur-
chased within 2 calendar months,
was long overdue and has proved
extremely popular.
However, it would appear that
amongst all these positive changes,
we are being overcharged for our
daily breakfast.
Signs in the SCR clearly state
food item prices, for a normal visi-
tor and for a student. As under-
graduates, we receive 10% discount
and VAT exemption; whilst staff
and postgraduates are denied this
latter luxury. It appears that the
computer system used at SCR tills
neglects to award the full discount
available to us for whatever reason
(maybe they assumed when they
built the system that no under-
graduates would ever use the SCR
and if they did, well tough, they can
pay what everyone else pays since
they’re not supposed to be there
anyway).
Take for example a recent break-
fast I purchased at the SCR. I pur-
chased 8 items (breakdown availa-
ble on request) which totalled £2.35
according to the marked prices, but
was charged £2.69 after my card
was swiped through the card read-
er at the till. Whilst the difference is
a matter of pennies, it is nearly 15%
more than what I should have been
paying which is a matter of consid-
erable concern. It defeats the pur-
pose of the loyalty card, since by
charging students 15% more each
time, catering can recoup the cost
of the 10th breakfast and still make
a profit.

sometime, and discover the pleas-
ures of a good wholesome meal
with plenty of variety, but be fore-
warned that his wallet may empty
somewhat faster than expected!
Yours truly,
Unhappy in JCR
PS: whatever happened to the wa-
ter coolers in JCR? Do they expect
us to buy all our drinking water
from the shop, whilst our richer
lecturers next door benefit from
chilled distilled water straight
from t’Valley?
