"Song, Dance and Revo-
lution" this is the synopsis
of Felix Greene's latest
film, CUBA VA! (Venus
Theatre, Kentish Town).
This is Felix Greene's third
film, his two previous films
'China' and 'Inside North
Vietnam' both received
great critical acclaim (I did
not see either film): 'Cuba
Va!' was also quite good.
It was light hearted show-
ing the Cuban people
twelve years after the
revolution and despite the
lack of consumer goods,
the political mistakes, the
decline in revolutionary
enthusiasm and the failure
to reach the hoped for
sugar harvest of ten mil-
lion tons as still remaining
optimistic. This was the
impression I obtained from
the film that even though
their material wealth is not
great the national spirit is
very high. The only detri-
ment to this film is very
poor quality soundtrack
which produced a wide
variety of crackles to spoil
the enjoyment of this film.
"The past is a foreign
country. They do things dif-
F i l m s
mmm
ferently there." So opens
THE GO-BETWEEN, Jos-
eph Losey's latest film.
With the screenplay by
Harold Pinter from L. P.
Hartley's novel. The film
shows the timelessness of
the Edwardian era with the
veneer of propriety and be-
neath the veneer, the illicit
sciously allowed Ted Bur-
gess to assault the very
foundations of the Upper
Classes. The film is excel-
lent: the timelessness is
shown in the slow, graceful
camera work. The dialogue
has been cut to just a
series of polite phrases
and understatements and
with the absence of any
sexually explicit scenes or
statement Losey intimates
what is happening by the
slightest physical move-
ment. Overall a film well
worth seeing. Also you
might be lucky enough to
see all the documentary, I
only saw the last half. It
was BALEIA, BALEIA
(which is Portuguese for
whales) and is a docu-
mentary about whale hunt-
ing from small boats and
the climax shows a whale
being hunted and killed
which was very well edit-
ed, combining the right
amount of excitement and
tenseness.
The films aren't quite
the films I said I'd be re-
viewing, but I hope to re-
view, at least 'Private
Road' in the next edition.

Curved Air
You will recall that Curved Air are the group with
two classically trained musicians and a singer who used
to be in "Hair" (Nudge Nudge) who came on to the
scene in the coolest possible way, man—they were
adopted as a "nice band" by John Peel. They brought
out an album with pretty patterns on it and in spite of
the howls of "hype!" rose to prominence as one of the
more interesting of the new electronic groups.
But times change. When Curved Air played at the
College something was missing from the Curved Air
of a year ago. The musical skills are still there of course,
particularly Francis Monkman's flowing keyboard work.
It has been severely brought home to me in the last
three weeks that there is more to playing the VCS3
Synthesizer than making freaky noises and Monkman
seems to have avoided this. During his most recent opus
"Piece of Mind" and also "What Happens When You
Blow Yourself Up?" he played some nice passages on
the synthesizer but I was constantly reminded of other
musicians, particularly Keith Emerson and, yes you've
guessed it, Terry Riley, and I think this is where the
group falls down — their new material doesn't have
that indelible "Curved Air" stamp on it that the first
album had, and old standards like "Vivaldi" and "Pro-
positions" are wearing a bit thin now. The only new
number I really like was "Everdance" featuring Darryl
Way's screaming violin and Monkman's organ (whoops)
competing for space, which set everdancing the audi-
ence which for most of the act had been behaving in
an extremely porridgy fashion. But as soon as Sonja
Kristina said "Come on, get up" the audience rose as
one. Because of this I doubt if the "enthusiastic" recep-
tion was a true reflection of the audience's apprecia-
tion, rather the audience entertaining itself. But I could
be completely wrong.
Air were preceded by Curtiss Maldoon who played a
not particularly memorable set although their stage chat
was amusing and they gained a polite reception.

Debatable
The debating society
picked a winner when it
chose the motion 'This
house condemns interfer-
ence in Pakistan's internal
affairs'. Mech Eng 542
(Deb Socs regular abode)
was pleasantly packed with
a strong contingent of stu-
dents with a personal con-
cern for the area involved.
Mr. Ahmed proposing
the motion based his case
on the assumption that the
armed intervention in
Bangla Desh was merely
an internal matter; the rest
of the world and Britain in
particular had no more
right to interfere, than
Pakistan had in Northern
Ireland. Also that the
world's concern should be
solely with the refugees in
India.
Opposing the motion
Mr. Bruce Douglas Mann
M.P. described his very
emotional experiences
whilst visiting the area and

talking to the refugees
(now 12 million in num-
ber). He believed that his-
tory would reveal the atro-
cities inflicted by the mili-
tary had surpassed even
the Nazi's efforts towards
the Jews. Later in an elo-
quent and impassioned
speech by an unknown
person, the same armies'
actions were described as
dastardly, cowardly and
bloodthirsty. He also sug-
gested that Yahya Khan's
form of democracy was
that if a majority opposed
his will he would physically
reduce the majority to a
minority. On the other hand
Mr. Ahmed claimed it was
impossible for the army to
commit genocide. This was
met with sorry shouts of
"they're having a bloody
good try".
The general opinion was
far from one sided. One
supporter of the motion
stated that India far from
being an innocent by-
stander had conspired
with Shaik Mujib Rahman
for the complete autonomy
of E. Pakistan. Another
contested Mr. Mann's evi-
dence on the grounds that
it was obtained via an
Indian interpreter and
hence liable to distortion.
The result, after a noisy
summing up requiring a
little table bashing by the
chairman was that the mo-
tion was defeated by 42
votes to 19 with 6 abs. An
enjoyable debate.

"YETI AT FOLK CLUB LAST WEEK"
R E C O R D S : Joni Mitchell
"Blue"
That's funny, you'll think, this record came out in
August. Yes I am perfectly aware that this is not a new
record; unfortunately the records promised by Polydor
have not arrived and will have to wait until the next
issue when they too will be out of date. Oh dear.
Still, this is a nice album. Nicely optimistic mostly,
not like "Both Sides Now"? although Joni's disillusioned
views on romance are still there in "A Case of You"
and "The Last Time I Saw Richard":—
"You like roses and kisses and pretty men to tell
you
all those pretty lies, pretty lies"
But if you're fed up with her cynical comments on
plastic love affairs listen to "California" and hear about
homesickness, or " B l u e " which is about drugs (I
think)—it could be a dig at the acid freaks who gave
Joni a tough time at the Isle of Wight last year, or per-
haps not. Jeez these singers get more enigmatic with
every song. Or if you just want to hear love songs there's
"My Old Man" and "Cary" which are rather similar.
Come to think of it all the songs are rather similar. I'd
better give the album another listen.
(After another listen) Super Super Super. Every
track a winner.
Seriously though folks this is a nice album, worth a
place in anyone's collection. Yawn. Wish that Velvet
Underground album had come on time.
