C o m m e m o r a t i o n Day

people
Union C o n c e r t
Many of us go right through college
maintaining up to the last our determina-
tion not to attend Commemoration Day.
But in the end many, like myself, are
goaded into participation by vague par-
ental threats, the chance of a day off
work, the opportunity to meet one's
friends and the prospect of a free tea.
D A R K S A T A N I C MILLS
The proceedings of Commem Day are
apparently steeped in ritual. Like the
Tm only here because I have to be" look
on the faces of the Students' Union and
staff members of the platform party, as
well as most of the graduates. And the
rendering of "Jerusalem" with less than
Women's Guild gusto, and whose refer-
ence to "dark satanic mills" was more
than usually apt in the light of today's
lull in employment prospects for gradu-
ates.
Dave Holman, playing the part of the
Student Orator, proclaimed "loyal hom-
age to our visitor", who, to the best
knowledge of your FELIX scout, had
omitted to come. Dave later expressed
amazement at the sensitivity of his micro-
phone.

Lord Penney made his usual Annual Re-
port, reaffirming the College's purpose
to cater for the "most advanced training
and research . . . especially in the appli-
cation to industry".
He mentioned "perturbations causing
headaches to a few of us" (what on
earth could he be talking about?) and
professed interest in the "increasing im-
portance of industrial relations".
On the financial side the authorities
were experiencing "considerable anx-
iety", and the (annual) running costs
(of the College) have increased from
£6.4m four years ago to £9.5m last year.
Of this £2.2m was spent on research,
less than £600,000 coming as industrial
sponsorship, or bribery as some would
churlishly have it!

Lord Penney said that the residential
problems of students were causing
"deep concern", but that the Ravens-
court flats scheme "promises well". And
the only delectable bit of whimsey from
the Lord was in this connection, when
he suggested courses in cooking, sewing
and cleaning to assist the flat-dwellers.
Regarding diversification in the more
orthodox sense, a perennial subject re-
quiring a few choice platitudes on such
occasions, Lord Penney's answer was
that "the question is, where to draw
the line".
S H O C K D I S C L O S U R E
The general part of the ceremony
comprises every one of last year's grad-
uates in attendance making a small bow
to the Chairman of the Governors, Lord
Sherfield, as the Dean of his College
reads out his name to the assembled
company. This was done at a fair old
rate, as some perfected their "running
right hand bow" as they sprinted across
the platform. There was some contro-
versy as to whether Lord Sherfield was
really asleep and kept waking himself
up when his chin slumped onto his
chest.
V A R I A T I O N S O N A T H E M E
Special treatment was however offer-
ed to the ladies, to whom the Lord
gallantly doffed his hat, and to special
prize winners, whose hands were blister-
ingly shaken, to some extent discredit-
ing the sleep theory. During this cere-
mony sweet music, more appropriate to
a palm court, gently fluttered in the
background.

S E C R E T A R Y
The last of his group was Dave Hob-
man, our Union Secretary, whose full
name had been negligently omitted
from the Dean's list. In a moment of
crisis, the Dean (whose ability to re-
member students forenames must have
been sorely strained, stammeringly dub-
bed him a derisory "Hobman".

Prof. Francis, playing the Staff Orator,
was now to wax eloquent about the five
new Fellows, which he did with due pro-
liferation of Gilbert and Sullivan lyrics,
a malconstructed sentence and a verse
of Masefield, and much more.
Of the new Fellows, Brigadier Bag-
nold, of sand wave fame, took the pro-
ceedings with a scarlet countenance,
whilst Letitia Chitty, whose office door
can be viewed any time in the Civil En-
gineering Department, was visibly shy
about the oration, and seemed to ex-
press disagreement when credited as
the first woman Telford prize winner.
Prof. Francis afterwards mentioned his
fear that dear old lady would fall asleep
during his spiel, which would have been
tragic for her frail frame, as she was
standing up at the time.
WHIZ KID S P E A R S
Mr. David Nicolson, a former I.C. stu-
dent who (as PRIVATE EYE 257 put it)
"holds down a roomfull of chairman-
ships and directorships", also Governor
and Fellow of the College, now took the
part of the Special Visitor. His address,
by previous standards, was mercifully
brief, but contained such gems as "I
have seen the tragedy of many engineers
who have chained themselves to their
drawing boards . . ." and the allegation
that Emeritus Professor Sir Owen Saun-
ders, a former lecturer of his student
days here must take some measure of
responsibility for what you have to put
up with today". A text of this speech,
for those interested, is presumably
available from the Publications Office.
UGM ELECTIONS FOR
NUS AND
REPERCUSSIONS
Despite "Some of the
best ever publicity for a
union meeting" the words
of Mr. Amos, the one two
weeks back got under way
five minutes late and hor-
ribly inquorate (140 maxi-
mum). The reason for this
sad state was undoubtedly
the decision to hold it in
the Union Upper Lounge
instead of the Great Hall,
presumably part of the pol-
icy to make the Union
building more a centre of
activity.
Some interesting trivia
included a request from
the News of the World for
students' experiences with
firms offering vacation
jobs with up to £40 a week,
only to discover they in-
volved encyclopedia selling
on a commision basis (or
something similar). Also a
male Bulgarian record col-
lector, and student requir-
es a pen friend. Anyone
interested on either count
please contact someone
in the Union.
President McLooge in-
formed us that friend
Mooney had broken even
after only two weeks (it
took six last year) and will
no doubt have amassed a
large profit by the end of
the year. The union's so-
licitor will be pleased to
take up any cases of har-
assment by landlords and
it is hoped a trial case can
be made against an accom-
modation bureau charging
for lists. Again anyone with
anything to say on these
matters, or knows of any
retailers, or services that
are prepared to give USK
card holders a discount
please make yourself
known to a Union official.
The guest speaker Mike
Terry, Secretary Elect of
NUS, spoke at length with
hands and mouth on the
aims of NUS. These boiled
down to the same as for
any other union, namely to
improve the income and
working conditions of its
members, and to fight
against individual injustic-
es. No one questioned that
IC students were getting
value for money for their
sizeable contribution via IC
Union to the national or-
ganisation. Piers Corbyn
thanked the NUS for its
part in preventing a major
injustice (need I say
more?) but questioned
their conciliatory methods
in the student union auton-
omy issue.
Elections for IC repre-
sentatives to the NUS Mar-
gate Conference followed.
Six could go; seven want-
ed to. However, as Mc-
Looge was going what
anyone said the problem
was to remove one out of
six. The six in question be-
ing: Rob Armitage, Mark
Wood, Piers Corbyn, John
Merlis, Geoff Franklin, and
John Sommers. Each
stated he wanted to go for
fairly noble reasons, and
all agreed that unemploy-
ment closely followed by
student union autonomy
were the main issues. A
system whereby all pres-
ent voted for the candi-
date they least wanted to
go resulted in Piers being
the most hated.
This method of election
and the result had led to
various repercussions,
some, some not surprising-
ly from Piers. In a letter to
the Union he claims the
result invalid on four
counts (i) the result was
very close, only three
votes covering the last
three candidates, (ii) the
very poor attendance mak-
ing the result unrepresen-
tative, (iii) the negative
voting system resulting in
anyone with strong views
being more likely to be
eliminated, (iv) the meth-
od of voting was supposed
to be discussed at the
meeting, which it was not.
All these are valid though
one wonders why he did
not make more of the last
three before the voting
took place.
John Sommers has also
complained about the
negative voting system
and wants the result de-
clared null and void. If not
he intends to vacate his
place and so force another
election. Finally more com-
plaints have come from an
Irish female mathematical
fresher (sorry have not
been able to discover her
name) who also wanted to
go to Margate but didn't
know about the meeting,
despite the best publicity
ever.
S T O I C
cont'd from page 1
At the moment there
seems little chance of fur-
ther expansion from the
present situation, owing to
the high cost of the cable
necessary for such an op-
eration. There are some
ideas of running an exten-
sion over to Southside
through one of the myriad
tunnels which appear to
go just about everywhere.
In fact, it would only be
practical if one of these ex-
isted as the added expense
of installing the cable
would probably put it be-
yond the club funds. Ig-
noring such minor prob-
lems of financing the pro-
ject, it would be rather
nice to have 'college-wide'
distribution with monitors
placed in strategic posi-
tions. This would really
give some meaning to the
name, student T.V. of I.C.
However, to get back to
reality, I will now get down
to the point of the whole
article, that is, to describe
the new magazine/news
programme which is about
to make its debut. It will
occur every Thursday at 1
p.m. in the Junior Com-
mon Room, the general
idea being that it will be
biased more to news inter-
views on the weeks that
Felix isn't published and
features on the alternate
weeks. Some things in
store are an interview with
our well beloved President
John McCullough and fea-
tures on rowing, club expe-
ditions, banking (I'm as-
sured it isn't as boring as
it sounds), films and occa-
sional bits out of network
programmes of exception-
al interest. The announcer
and interviewer on the first
programme will be Dave
Willis, who is a Computer
Science P.G. As it stands
the organisers of the pro-
gramme appear to be rely-
ing on the three week gap
between two issues of Fe-
lix which is coming near
the end of term hence put-
ting the two out of place.
However, they appear to
have neglected the fact
that this disappears at the
beginning of next term but
I am sure that this will be
eventually sorted out!
So when you finally sit
down to watch, bear in
mind the difficulties that
go into producing a pre-
sentable television pro-
gramme.
Anyone can offer de-
structive criticism but con-
structive ideas are a good
deal more useful.
