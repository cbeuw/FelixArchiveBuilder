'Stoic* Presents
First Programme
S.T.O.I.C. in case you didn't know, is the Student
Television of Imperial College and in a masterly demon-
stration of co-ordination and skill on behalf of the staff
of Felix we are publishing this article just as the club
is about to show its first regularly produced programme.
However, before I go in-
to details about this I plan
to tell you all about the
club. (There are reasons
for this, none of which I'm
going to disclose, so
there!) This was set up in
1969 by Electrical Engin-
eering, who found they
had a lot of (very) expen-
sive equipment with no
one to use it. All these bits
and pieces had been
bought originally in con-
nection with the public
speaking classes which
are part of the Associated
Studies (or is it General
Studies?) courses. Every
student in the department
has to do various talks in
each year, these counting
towards the final degree.
(These are now recorded
by S.T.O.I.C. members
mainly on Wednesday af-
ternoons and so the qual-
ity is considerably improv-
ed.) All in all a remark-
ably good idea, consider-
ing how important it is to
be able to communicate
ideas in a coherent man-
ner.
The club therefore owns
practically none of the
hardware that it uses and
this is the point that I was
told to be quite explicit
on, as it appears the de-
partment is very touchy
about the subject. Appar-
ently 'they' object to see-
ing articles published
where the authors condes-
cendingly mentions that
S.T.O.I.C. have a studio
which, they occasionally
let the Elec. Eng. use. In
fact it is the other way
round! This dependence
on the goodwill (or rather
lack of actual badwill, and
there is a difference) of
the department puts the
club in a particularly vul-
nerable position as it has
always to be nice to every-
one. What would happen,
say, if it televised a discus-
sion of which the Depart-
ment disapproved? (I have
changed to a capital letter
as it now seems appro-
priate.) In fact Felix itself
is bowing to internal pres-
sure in not discussing the
case of the 'there but
not theirs' piece of com-
plex electronics and preci-
ous engineering which is
slowly collecting dust in
the T.V. studio. One of
three cameras with full
sound and vision mixing
facilities, numerous small
and large monitors scat-
tered about the place, and,
a video tape recorder,
the club owns only one 25
inch screen monitor,
bought for them by the
Union.
This cost £100, which
is odd in itself as a proper
television containing about
twice the electronics costs
only £60. I believe it also
owns two video tapes. This
appears to be of little con-
sequence until one consid-
ers that they cost about
£30 each! You may have
got the impression that
S.T.O.I.C. is entirely run by
Elec. Eng., but it is in fact
connected with R.C.C. in
exactly the same way as
all other I.C. societies.
This explains the fact that
you have to pay a sub-
scription which at first
sight might seem unneces-
sary.

SOUTHSIDE SHOP
The South Side Shop is
in future to open at 9 a.m.
so that people can buy pro-
visions (before rather than
during) first lectures. Also
there is to be Saturday
morning opening.

LAW UNTO THEMSELVES
The Union is distinctly
peeved at the way Ents is
by-passing normal require-
ments for approval of maj-
or policy changes. Ents,
who regularly make big
losses on big name con-
certs, have instituted week-
ly big-name Saturday con-
certs, and plan to scrap
hops. Also, in failing to ad-
mit a Felix photographer
into the recent Curved Air
concert, they are breaking
a condition of their Union
grant acceptance.

SHOCKING EXTORTION
Notes included with in-
vitations to Commemora-
tion Day drew attention to
the services of the "Uni-
versity Degree Photo-
grapher". The notes un-
fortunately forgot to men-
tion that the cost of six
identical post card size
prints or one single
plate print, for instance,
was no less than £2. Who
awarded this lucrative,
near monopolistic fran-
chise? Why was no check
of fair pricing made?
IN THE MUCK HEAP
The habit which local
News Residents seem to
encourage, namely dogs
defacing in Princes Gar-
dens, is reaching crisis
point. This subject was re-
cently brought up by Lin-
stead Hall committee who
are annoyed at having to
delicately pick their way
through the mire.
Lunchtime O'Bladder
SHOCK ALLEGATION
Mr. D. Sugden, in reply
to allegations that at least
three of the three Colcutts
featured in the Freshers'
Issue, the current and the
next issue of Felix are no
longer students at Imperial
College, said this was
pure coincidence. It seems
that some traditions of sec-
recy in the identity of the
writer of the Colcutt col-
umn have been lost.
APOLOGIA
We apologise to Dave
Lee for implicating him in
the recent walk through
the plate glass window
alongside the main door of
Linstead Hall. The victim
or culprit, was apparently
another Dave. In order to
prevent further such oc-
currences, the sub-warden
has arranged to have the
tables replaced in front of
the windows.
Lunchtime O'Bruises
NO ORDINARY CARROT
Students opening bank
accounts should give con-
sideration to what the
bank will charge them
when they are no longer
students. A recent gradu-
ate queried this, and dis-
covered to his horror that
to avoid charges when
banking with the Midland
he would have to keep his
current account above
£150 in credit on average.
This compared badly with
another bank approached.
Be warned.
SEAFORD BWANA
The other night, whilst
not so sober, Carl Seaford
told Dave Amos that he is
not a holder of a British
Passport. He does, in fact,
hold a Ghana passport.
MOONEY CLEAN UP
Further to Felix probe
in the previous issue, Mr.
Mooney is pleased to an-
nounce that his kitchens
will be professionally
cleaned by an outside firm.
Lunchtime O'Beanz
and Chips
BAR BID
The Union is pressing to
take responsibility for the
bars, and thus prevent the
not inconsiderable profits
going to subsidise the re-
fectories. Look forward
to cheaper drinks and
dearer meals.
