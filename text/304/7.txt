I st XV Victorious
l.C. 1st XV notch up
three more victories
Against Wimbledon 1st
XV on Saturday 16th, l.C.
1st XV notched up their
second win of the season
in a very scrappy but
closely contested game at
Harlington. The scoring
was opened when Wimble-
don were caught offside
and James kicked an easy
penalty in front of the
posts. However, Wimble-
don equalised when our
lad from Wigan tripped
over somebody's head—a
complete accident but

ard.
On Wednesday 20th l.C.
played an under-strength
City University 1st XV. Af-
ter turning up with only 14
men another of their play-
ers was injured and City
had to continue with 13
men. This allowed i.C. to
dominate the game and
score 8 tries of which two
were converted (James was
Wimbledon were awarded
a penalty. Two further pen-
alties followed in the sec-
ond half—one for each
side and the game being
in the balance up until the
last minute when from a
brilliant handling move-
ment by the l.C. backs
John McDonough scored
in the corner to clinch the
game. 10 points to 6
points.
Scorers: McDonough
Try. James: Penalty (2).
Team: J. Hughes; J.
Hunt; P. Pilkington; A. Hav-
kicking again). The final
score was 36-7 with City
getting a late try and drop-
ped goal as a consolation.
Scorers: Numerous (I've
forgotten anyway).
Team: J. Hughes; j . Mc-
Donough; J. Hunt; B.
Baines; M. Gallani; A.
James (Capt.); C. Flana-
gan; M. Sugrue; H. Mich-
ael; C. Wrigley; C. Humph-
ries; R. Matthews; I. Rhys;
I. Partridge; P. Tebbett.
23rd October l.C. played
Marlow away in the bril-
liant sunshine and came
away victorious by 20-4.
Marlow attacked strongly
in the first few minutes but
the l.C. scored a complete-
ly unexpected try when
James handed inside to
Tebbett and along the sup-
porting forwards for Mc-
Donough to score in the
corner. The conversion
failed. After this supreme
effort (?) James flaked
and decided to have a rest
and l.C. were reduced to
the men. The weakened
team held Marlow to 4-4 at
half-time and then turned
round with the conditions
now in their favour.
Straight from the kick
off l.C. applied pressure to
the Marlow line and l.C.
capitalised on the Marlow
defensive errors to score
three more fine tries, two
from Hunt, who left the
Marlow full back groping
at his heels and one when
Sugrue trundled over ob-
viously inspired by a cer-
tain supporter on the
touchline.
A riotous night followed
with this certain supporter
enjoying the excellent
singing of the 1st and Ex
1st together with an im-
promptu strip from a Mar-
low player. At the moment
the Ex 1st are also unbeat-
en having played Osterley
(8-4) and Marlow (24-9)
and this portends well for
a successful season to fol-
low.
Scorers: Tries: Hunt (2),
McDonough, Sugrue.
Team: J. Hughes; J.
Hunt; B. Baines; P. Pilking-
ton; J. McDonough; A.
James (Capt); C. Flana-
gan; M. Sugrue; H. Mich-
ael; C. Wrigley; C. Humph-
ries; R. Matthews; I. Rhys;
I. Partridge; A. Tebbett.
I st XI held to a draw
A.F.C.—
With the league pro-
gramme now underway,
l.C. teams have once more
shown their worth, and is-
sued a warning to other
colleges of the l.C. trophy
hunt to come.
On Wednesday, 20th Oc-
tober, l.C. ran out easy
winners in four league fix-
tures with U.C.
At U.C., the scorers
were:—
l.C. 1st XI 3, U.C. 1st XI
1.
I.C. 3rd XI 1, U.C. 2nd XI
0.
I.C. 4th I 6, U.C. 4th XI
3
while back at Harlington
the 2nd team beat U.C. 3rd
4-2.
The first XI, although
running out 3-1 victors at
the final whistle, gave rath-
er a disappointing and un-
impressive performance,
they seemed to lack all ur-
gency, enthusiasm and in-
volvement in a half which
contained many niggling
tactics from the opposit-
tion. However at half time
the team pulled themsel-
ves together and got down
to some serious thought
about the game. This prov-
ed to be beneficial and in
the second half l.C. scor-
ed the two goals which
made the difference in the
score-line.
On Saturday, 23rd Octo-
ber, the firsts and seconds
travelled to Donnington to
play the P.E. College and
came away jubilant. Whe-
ther this outburst could
be attributed to their per-
formances on the field at
the excess of female stud-
ents at this college was
not determinable. Anyway
the firsts won 2-1, but the
seconds lost 4-2. Mean-
while back in London the
thirds lost 3-1 to QMC, the
fourths drew 2-2 also with
QMC, and the sixths beat
Chelsea seconds 5-2 in the
preliminary round of the
cup—an extremely good
performance.
On Wednesday last, 27th
October l.C. took on Kings
at Harlington, the firsts
drew with Kings firsts 1-1,
whilst the seconds won
3-0 against Kings seconds
and the sixths beat Kings
thirds 9-2. In other league
games the thirds lost to
Birkbeck seconds 3-0 and
the fourths beat the fifths
4-0.
The firsts game with
Kings was a rather medi-
Fencing EDITORIAL
On Wednesday after-
noon, 27th October, Im-
perial College Fencing
teams struck again! They
were fencing away against
King's College, London.
The men's sabre team
scored a great success,
beating King's by 8 bouts
to 1. The ladies foil team,
although short of one fen-
cer, soundly managed a
6-3 victory. Even the men's
foil team won by 5 bouts
to 4. This, considering the
fact that King's have a
much bigger fencing club
than l.C. is no mean feat.
However to prevent
King's getting an inferior-
ity complex, the l.C. epee
team allowed them to gain
a 9-0 victory, when they
could murmur excuses of
absent fencers and scarc-
ity of time. Due to the fav-
ourable results, King's may
even be invited for a re-
turn match later on in the
term.
The next fencing fixture
is most impressively
against Aberystwyth Uni-
versity on Saturday, 30th
October at home, when
one hopes the results will
be just as encouraging.
Cricket
The cricket has been
very successful over the
past few years, winning
the U.L.U. Cup last year
for the 2nd year in succes-
sion.
The Club runs five teams
(including a Sunday XI)
during the season and in-
door nets on Sunday after-
noons during the Autumn
and Spring terms, which
are especially attractive to
new members enabling
them to meet senior mem-
bers of the club before the
season ends.
The big attraction of the
year is the Annual Tow.
Ten hectic days are spent
in Devon where much cric-
ket is playing in between
the boozing and singing.
This event is a must. P.S.
Last year we didn't lose a
single match or Tow (we'll
never know how we did
it!)
Anyone interested please
contact Joe Williams in
Beit Hall or Ken Schofield,
Holbein House, 62 Evelyn
Gardens, Room 62G2.
The term has started well for all sports clubs, with,
at the time of writing, most of the clubs first teams yet
to be beaten.
The 'clean-up' that has occurred in professional soc-
cer has influenced referees of the amateur game to
such an extent that two members of the Football Club
have already been sent off. Captains of all sides, and
more especially players, must now realise that arguing
violently with the referee besides being a disgrace to
any game, will now lead to the 'early bath'.
The Pie and Mash season is now over and reflecting
they must be considered a success for the members
who attended but the purpose of introducing freshers
to 'old lags' seems to have fallen foul this year. The
attendance of new members was poor and this could
be attribnted to either poor advertising by the Club
committees or by early apathy being shown by the
freshers themselves.
The Badminton club have found the Great Hall to
their liking and since they have convincingly won all
their early matches. The Men's I team is of exception-
ally high standard and well worth watching now that
the home venue is so convenient.
Club members ought to be aware that this term ACC
has asked the Clubs to revise or in some cases, pro-
duce their constitution. It may seem trivial and boring
btu it could affect the members and the club at some
later date.
Once again a reminder that on Friday, November
5th there is to be a bonfire complete with disco, and
hot jacketed potatoes at Harlington. All members of the
college and USK are welcome.
I.C. for sale
If you ever venture as far north as Neasden, you
might find a reservoir, known as the Welsh Harp. It is
here that Imperial College Sailing Club keeps its seven
Firefly dinghies, sharing a well-equipped clubhouse,
new last year, with the other colleges of London Uni-
versity.
Every Wednesday, and most weekends, the boats are
being used: there's instruction for beginners on Wed-
nesdays, races on Wednesdays and Saturdays, and
recreational sailing on Sunays. If it is racing you find
most interesting, l.C. is involved in about four teams
which race regularly. The U.L. team, which is of a very
high standard, consists mainly of I.C.S.C. members,
and we also manage to provide two teams for the
inter-U.L. League races on Wednesdays, as well as a
team which sails against other Universities at the
weekends.
I.C. is also the only college in England to own a
cruiser. She is a 27 foot fibreglass sloop, of the 'Folk-
dancer' class, and is moored at Wralness, near Har-
wich, on the East Coast. She sails most weekends,
God and skipper willing, and goes on cruises lasting
for a week or two during the vacation. Although week-
end cruises are really restricted to East Coast 'hops',
she has been on cruises to Scandinavia, France, Bel-
gium, etc., and even as far as the Isle of Wight. Finan-
cially, Ichthyosaurus (Icky for short) is entirely self-
sustaining, so although the dinghy-sailing is free once
you have paid your subscription, we have to make an
additional hire charge for the use of the cruiser. It's
always easy for us to find crews, but we are con-
stantly on the look-out for skippers, so get in touch
if you've done any cruising before, or even if you're just
interested.
If you want any more information, have a look at the
Sailing Club notice-board, outside the Union Bar, or
see me, Graham Eastwood, in Weeks 61, or Mike Mar-
tin, in Keogh 266. For cruising see Henry Shaw, in
Tizard 552. Alternatively, just come up to the Harp
one Wednesday; we usually take people up in the
R.C.C. Crewbus from Southside at 1 p.m. Hope to see
you there.

ocre affair. Kings started
very well and had l.C. de-
fending desperately, but
the l.C. defence only
cracked once in the first
half to give Kings a 1-0
lead at half-time even
though they had come
close to scoring on pre-
vious occasions. However
during the second half l.C.
came more into the game
and managed to pull back
the goal which was neces-
sary to share the points.
Again this was a rather
disappointing show by a
first team which should be
promising well, and it was
obvious that a lot more
thought should be given to
the game by each individ-
ual player before taking
the field. However with
some hard, thoughtful
work and training the pre-
liminary teething troubles
will be overcome, but it
won't be easy.
