" I t i s proposed t h a t the f i n a n c i n g of student unions • should be e x t a b l i s b e d on a new
b a s i s as f o l l o w s : -
i$ A l l students at an i n s t i t u t i o n , f u l l - - and p a r t - t i m e , would a u t o m a t i c a l l y be
members of the s t u d e n t s ' union w i t h o u t payrient of any fee and e n t i t l e d to use i t s
premises and f a c i l i t i e s , . There would be p r o v i s i o n f o r those who on 'consscence'
grounds objected to b ;ing r e c b e r a of the v n i o n to r e s i g n , but t h i s would not d e p r i v e
thee of the access to f a c i l i t i e s p r o v i d e d f o r the general stuednt body.
( i i ) No union s u b s c r i p t i o n would be i n c l u d e d i n the fees payable by l o c a l a u t h -
o r i t i e s and i n d i v i d u a l s .
( i i i ) To encourage a u t h o r i t i e s i n c o l l e g e s and u n i v e r s i t i e s to measure the c l a i m s
f o r student union f a c i l i t i e s a g a i n s t other c l a i m s on t h e i r r e s o u r c e s , the i n s t i t -
u t i o n would be r e s p o n s i b l e f o r p r o v i d e i n g and m a i n t a i n i n g union f a c i l i t i e s from i t s
g e n e r a l funds,, The i n s t i t u t i o n would decide a c c o r d i n g to l o c a l circumstances the
extent to which i t p r o v i d e d the f a c i l i t i e s i t s e l f , or handed money over to the s t u -
d e n t s ' union f o r i t to p r o v i d e them„ The use of any such funda banded over to the
union would be accountable to the C o m p t r o l l e r and A u d i t o r General or the D i s t r i c t
A u d i t o r ,
( i v ) To meet the problem Sshat under the present systit?, student unions sometimes
spend funds d e r i v e d f r o ; , compulsory s u b s c r i p t i o n s on purposes which would more
a p p r o p r i a t e l y be supported by the v o l u n t a r y s u b s c r i p t i o n of i n d v i d u a l s t u d e n t s , the
etudent maintenance grant would be i n c r e a s e d by a modest sum to enable students to
j o i n p a r t i c u l a r c l u b s and s o c i e t i e s . At present ties:- are f i n a n c e d by the u n i o n ;
under the new system they would charge a seperate s u b s c r i p t i o n and students
could pay aim., j o i n , or n o t , on an e n t i r e l y v o l u n t a r y basis,,
Perhaps paragraph 14 should a l s o be n o t e d ; "No l e g i s l a t i o n would be necessary" (to
b r i n g about these c h a n g e s ) «
I . C . U i i s ( o b v i o u s l y ) a n y t h i n g but happy about these p r o p o s a l s , and w i l l be h o l d i n g an
