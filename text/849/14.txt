• British Government spending on Research and
Development will fall by as much as £250m over the
next three years according to an official Government
report. The report, from the Cabinet Office Science
and Technology Unit, predicts that funding will drop
from its 1987/88 level of £4616m to £4282m by
1991 /92. Britain's Science spending, as a proportion
of the country's wealth, is already lagging well behind
its competitors and the predicted changes will knock
this back by another 30%.
The report also revealed that of the 11,835
scientists who graduated in 1987, only a quarter took
up jobs in research and half went into finance, law and
administration. Engineers were more loyal with over
70% staying with their subject.
• Health agencies in the USA and Europe are
attempting to allay fears of a connection between
genetically engineered human insulin and the deaths
of several insulin-dependant diabetics from
hypoglycaemia. Hypoglycaemia is a reaction to
excessively high levels of insulin and has many
physically uncomfortable recognisable symptoms.
However there is anecdotal evidence that these
effects are less severe and less likely to be noticed
for an human insulin surplus than for animal based
insulin.
As yet there is no scientifically established link
between insulin type and symptoms and, although
there have been a number of surveys of diabetics,
none have produced conclusive results.
• Indian meteorologists have developed a method
for accurately predicting the behaviour of the annual
monsoon so vital for the country. Their model is
simplistic and provides only qualitative results yet is
said to be able to predict whether the monsoon will
be good or bad up to 2 months ahead.
• The Japanese Government has agreed to a total
ban on all Ivory imports. Japan is the world's largest
importer of ivory and the decision has been
condemned by the 'legal' ivory trading countries such
as South Africa. It may be entirely coincidental that
Japan will be hosting the 1991 meeting of the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species.
Environmentalists will be less pleased to hear that
despite recent protests Japanese fishermen will
continue to use drift nets. These are long fine-meshed
nylon nets designed to catch squid, salmon and tuna
fish. However they also catch and kill many other fish,
sea birds and sea mammals.
• Space scientists studying the results of Voyager
2's Neptune flypast have discovered what would
appear to be a geyser on the moon Triton. A plume
of dark particles was spotted on a photograph taken
on the 24th of August at a distance of around
100,000km. The eruption is thought to be due to
Nitrogen gas forcing its way through the surface of
the moon and blasting clouds of dark, dirty ice
particles out into space.
