Exploding myths and
penetrating warheads
People in p o w e r prop their ideologies up w i t h densely
w o v e n m y t h s . Scientists a r e trained t o d e b u n k :
o c c a s s i o n a l l y they penetrate deceit; e v e n more
occasionally they s u c c e e d in m a k i n g changes. T o d a y ,
c h a n g e s in the Soviet Union are being driven by m a n y
forces. O n e o f w h i c h appears t o be the n e w class of
scientifically literate and politically a w a r e pragmatists

*Myth: Scientists should be on tap, but not on top
A c a d e m i c Roald S a g d e e v , G o r b a c h e v ' s S c i e n c e
A d v i s o r is an e x a m p l e w h o ' s o n tap, and appears t o
be getting o n t o p . A c a d e m i c A n d r e i K o k o s h i n is
another; h e broke o f f a m e e t i n g w i t h Boris Yeltsin
( G o r b a c h e v ' s r a d i c a l o p p o n e n t ) t o t e a c h o n
Reductions in Nuclear Arsenals. M a n y of the problems
w e n o w f a c e are merely t h e result o f m i s p l a c e d
t e c h n i c a l expertise, y e t t o solve t h e m w e need
political will. Political will c a n be forced by technical
a r g u m e n t s . T o d a y major c h a n g e s in t h e w o r l d ' s
political s y s t e m s are shifting the balance of p o w e r .
Our e n v i r o n m e n t is c r e a k i n g w i t h o z o n e depletion,
pollution and acid rain. T e m p e r a t u r e s are s e t t o rise
by a m o u n t s equal t o the rises since the last ice age.
W e f a c e t h e fact that countries perpetually in t h e
w o r l d ' s hot-spots a r e about t o acquire nuclear
w e a p o n s and a d v a n c e d delivery s y s t e m s .
• Myth: Gorbachev is impregnable, popular and we
in the West need do nothing: O u r Soviet colleagues
m a d e it clear that since the last party congress, and
w i t h increasing nationalist unrest, G o r b a c h e v ' s
popularity h a s p l u m m e t t e d . It i s said that M r s
T h a t c h e r w o u l d probably beat h i m in a free election.
T h e forces o f c o n s e r v a t i v e and military reaction are
still in place and if they w e r e t o regain their old p o w e r
then E a s t - W e s t relations w o u l d s o o n be back in the
Ice A g e . W e ought t o respond t o t h e repeated
initiatives f r o m the Eastern b l o c - o r w e cut a w a y the
g r o u n d f r o m t h e forces p u s h i n g c h a n g e . If w e d o
nothing, w e risk the future. A t the m o m e n t , the Soviet
U n i o n is hardly capable of invading the W e s t . Indeed,
the cuts i n t h e oft-claimed Soviet superiority i n
c o n v e n t i o n a l forces m e a n that a Soviet blitzkrieg
W e s t w a r d s w o u l d b e impossible w i t h o u t several
w e e k s o f highly visible military buildup.
9 Myth: Global warming is still unproven; action now
would be precipitous. Dr J e r e m y Leggett covered the
G r e e n h o u s e problem in detail. He d e m o n s t r a t e d that
Page 1 2
the correlation b e t w e e n a t m o s p h e r i c C 0 2 a n d
temperature is remarkable. Natural processes will only
m a k e things w o r s e . F o r e x a m p l e , it s e e m s m o s t
biospheric G r e e n h o u s e gases are currently locked up
in t h e permafrost. O n c e that starts t o melt, t h e
temperature runs a w a y . If w e wait for more facts, b y
the time w e get round t o m a k i n g c h a n g e s it'll be too
late. Recent U K expenditure on G r e e n h o u s e research
c a m e t o £ 1 0 m , about one t h o u s a n d t h of that spent
on w e a p o n s p r o g r a m m e s like Trident: s y s t e m s that
c a n never be u s e d , deter nothing and d o not w o r k .
• Myth: Global warming means we need to expand
the use of neclear energy. A n o t h e r m y t h put together
and supported by vested interests. Leggett claimed,
w i t h the backing of senior Soviet experts, that since
coal burning a c c o u n t s for only 1 0 % o f G r e e n h o u s e
gases, replacing it w i t h nuclear energy not only does
not solve t h e problem b u t distracts u s from real
solutions. For the developing w o r l d , it w o u l d m e a n
building one Chernobyl-sized reactor every f e w days.
Leggett paraphrased W o o d y Allen. M a n k i n d f a c e s a
choice: there are t w o paths, and one path leads t o
misery, deprivation and abject horror, and the other
leads to extinction. M o s t lecturers s e e m e d optimistic
that w e w o u l d c h o o s e the first.
9Myth: Arms controllers hate nuclear weapons.
W r o n g , t h e y l o v e t h e m . T h e y l o v e t a l k i n g
m e g a t o n n a g e , deep penetration aids, escalation
d o m i n a n c e , use-it-or-lose-it, like any healthy y o u n g
men. They k n o w all about the jargon used to mystify,
and t h e arcane p h y s i c s around w h i c h t h e d e b a t e
swirls. There s e e m s t o be a problem here, in that t o
get credibility and c o n t a c t s in t h e w o r l d o f a r m s
control, y o u need t o w o r k w i t h people and c o n c e p t s
f r o m the d a y s o f the a r m s race.
9Myth: A test ban is not verifiable. A lot o f people
in the W e s t , particularly in the U S and the U K , don't
w a n t a nuclear test ban. T h e unverifiability o f a
nuclear test ban hinges on the idea that a treaty has
to be 1 0 0 % verifiable in all c o n d i t o n s t o b e useful. In
reality, a C o m p r e h e n s i v e T e s t B a n probably i s
verifiable, according t o several Soviet and A m e r i c a n
experts at the School and verification technologies are
certainly good e n o u g h for the risk of being c a u g h t
while cheating t o b e u n a c c e p t a b l y high. S o w h o is
s t o p p i n g t h e C T B T ? L o o k o u t f o r t h e d e b a t e
intensifying over the next year, w h e n countries like
Argentina and Iran will be urging countries like the U K
and t h e U S A t o b e responsible w i t h their nuclear
w e a p o n s .
• Myth: the problems cannot get worse. It w a s a
characteristic of m a n y of the lectures, from w h a t e v e r
side, that problems affecting just a handful o f
countries n o w c o u l d s o o n b e c a u s i n g problems for
m a n y . E v e n e n v i r o n m e n t a l p r o b l e m s like C F C
production (in that m a n y d e v e l o p i n g countries import
these Greenhouse gases) are soluble if action is taken
right a w a y . Physicists shook their heads at this, and
used phrases like 'multiparticle d y n a m i c s ' and looked
worried.
