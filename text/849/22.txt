strikes back
Dear Editor,
I have apologised for the 'cock-up in
communications' headlined in FELIX on Friday
October 27. Nonetheless, I do think your picture
caption suggesting that the Health Centre is a 'house
of horror' was excessively harsh on us. We work
extremely hard to provide a top rate service to all our
patients and it would be nice to see FELIX writing
about the positive aspects of what we offer.
May I once again, through your columns invite any
member of College, patient or potential patient of the
Health Centre, to contact me directly with any
problems concerning the Health Centre. May I also
invite anybody interested to come to the next meeting
of the Health Centre Patients' Group, which will be
on tuesday November 14 at 4.45pm at the Health
Centre in the Group Room. If you have any worries,
moans, ideas or constructive suggestions do come
along and let us hear them.
Dr R Gillon, Director, College Health Service.

the other Applied Biologists and final year UG's for
whom the AUT action caused major difficulties.
However, I do feel that any malice, resentment or
bitterness should be directed at the
lecturers/organisers involved in allowing this, not the
individual concerned. After all, if we had been offered
the same opportunity for placement, and the same
opportunity to take our exams later (or when suitable),
would we have turned it down? I doubt it.

Dear Dave,
As one of the final year Applied Biologists referred
to in the 'Personal' article, issue 848, I have a reply
for 'name withheld':
I would be the first to agree that treatment of the
individual referred to in the said article was unfair to
Dear FELIX,
Most of the students who visit the STA office in
the walkway must have noticed that STA advertises
holidays in northern Cyprus. As most people know,
northen Cyprus was invaded by the Turkish army in
1974 and it is still illegally occupied. In this College
there are students whose relatives were killed, injured
or missing, and many were forced to leave their home
because of that, probably in the same place that now
is advertised as a holiday resort.
Besides, all the countries of the United Nations
(except, of course, Turkey) have refused to recognise
the so-called 'state' of northern Cyprus.
It is our belief that such trips must not be organised
or advertised at all. The 'Student Travel Agency', we
think, should be an agency for students and not a
company that only seeks to make profit by any
means, especially when this supports the violation of
human rights. With this letter we want to express our
deepest regret for this attitude.
Yours sincerely,
The Committee of the Hellenic Society of IC.
You're
wrong, Jack
Dear Dave,
Michelle Codill's letter about loans and the Union's
actions is typical of the 'I'm alright Jack' attitude that
seems to be prevalent at the moment.
Over the last few years we've seen health cuts,
Clause 28, benefit cuts, the poll tax and now student
loans. But if you're with BUPA, straight, middle class,
a homeowner and about to walk into your job with
Price Waterhouse then why care.
The silent majority allow poverty, homelessness,
oppression, racism, homophobia and more to continue
through their lack of action. Pastor Niemoeller, a
victim of the Nazis, wrote this on the matter:-
Firstly they came for the Jews
and I did not speak out-
because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for the communists
and I did not speak out-
because I was not a communist.
Then they came for the trade unionists
and I did not speak out-
because I was not a trade unionist.
Then they came for me-
and there was no one left
to speak out for me.
Maybe we should put up with it being harder for us
to get jobs (after banning Price Waterhouse) and
speak out a bit more often. One day they might just
come for Michell and co.
Yours sincerely,
Alistair Goodall, DoC III.
