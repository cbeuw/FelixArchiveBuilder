Dear Mark
W i l l you please convey my
thanks to M a r y Freeman for
her letter i n F E L I X . I ' m
afraid it wasn't particularly
informative for me personally,
but that is because I too was
at the meeting, so I knew it all
already.
I didn't really feel Miss
Freeman's account was com-
prehensive enough, it failed to
point out the juicy bits, such
as: why is the National Deaf
C h i l d r e n ' s S o c i e t y R a g ' s
m a i n c h a r i t y ? Because the
R a g C o m m i t t e e enjoy the
kiddies party and they know
they can get collection licences
if it's for the N D C S (that's
how I understood the argu-
ment). Frankly, I find those
reasons s e c o n d a r y i n the
argument; more important, I
think, is where the money
goes, and yes I did suggest the
money go to a charity in the
T h i r d W o r l d , where the same
money can have a far greater
effect. T h e meting thought
that the N D C S was worth-
w h i l e , because for a mere
£200 someone can have his
h e a r i n g r e s t o r e d ; b u t for
about £10 someone in India
can have his sight restored!
O t h e r i m p o r t a n t issues
discussed were: s h o u l d the
R a g M a g have a glossy cover?
(This is because it drastically
increases the cost of printing.)
T h e two reasons given for not
changing it were that they
w o u l d keep b e t t e r , so we
could show our grandchil-
d r e n ! ( c h u c k l e , c h u c k l e ) .
Secondly, people are more
likely to buy a copy if it looks
good; but because the R a g
M a g has made a loss (for two
years r u n n i n g ? ) the p r i c e
may have to be raised to 50p.
If the content is not going to
be improved. T h e n it doesn't
deserve a glossy cover, and if
50p, it won't sell as easily,
no longer feel it necessary
to put forward constructive
.ideas, such as suggestions for
c h a r i t i e s , because R a g re-
ceives e n o u g h letters from
charities, pleading for money:
all they have to do is read
through them!
I hope that this information
will have been of some use to
M a r y Freeman and others.
Tours sincerely

Dear Mark
I see from Nick Morton's
letter ( F E L I X 617) that he is
acting true to form. As soon as
he had doled out a couple of
insults he promptly passed the
buck; truly the height of in-
spired leadership.
O f course the Halls are not
keen to be i n v o l v e d i n a
c e n t r a l l a u n d r y . T h e y arc-
p e r f e c t l y h a p p y w i t h the
present system; indeed, many
r e s i d e n t s f i n d it h a r d to
understand how anyone could
come up with such a short-
sighted idea as scrapping the
linen service.
It is not so much myself
who is concerned about those
o t h e r , l a z y s t u d e n t s ; the
cleaners in Southside have
expressed their concern about
the deterioration in hygiene
which would result from the
removal of the linen service. I
am reliably informed that as
m a n y as t e n p e r c e n t of
r e s i d e n t s c a n n o t even be
bothered to strip their beds
and leave the dirty sheets to
be collected for the sake of
having clean linen, how the
supposedly k n o w l e d g e a b l e
M r M o r t o n can expect them
to a c t u a l l y wash a n d i r o n
their own sheets every week is
a matter of pure conjecture.
If N i c k c a n ' t l i c k the
Rector's boots enough to get a
job as a member of College
staff, he ought to apply to the
Treasury, where his apparent
t o t a l l a c k of a c c o u n t i n g
k n o w l e d g e w o u l d be w e l l
received. If the Halls upgrade
their present laundry facilities,
considerable capital expense
will be incurred; M r M o r t o n
obviously cannot understand
that this will come out of
resident's pockets. A further
charge which he has conveni-
ently "forgotten" (if he ever
thought of it in the first place)
is the cost of residents supply-
ing their own sheets, either by
h i r i n g t h e m at s u i t a b l y
commerical rates, or capital
outlay of purchasing them.
He will no doubt claim that
students living elsewhere have
to provide there own sheets,
but so what? Some students
live in bedsits infested with
c o c k r o a c h e s , but is, N i c k
suggesting that v e r m i n be
introduced to Southside just
so that everyone is equal?
Apart from the extra costs
mentioned above, there is the
very important consideration
of time and inconvenience.
W e are supposedly here to get
an education, not to wash
sheets. N o one in their right
m i n d (this c l e a r l y doesn't
i n c l u d e M r M o r t o n ) c a n
honestly believe that washing
and ironing a pair of sheets a
week takes no time at all.
There are more important
things in a student's life than
money, M r M o r t o n , and the
extra effort and inconveni-
ence are not- worth the cost of
a pint of shandy each week.
In answer to his final point:
representatives ol the residents
of Southside were waiting to
c h a l l e n g e the P r e s i d e n t ' s
report at the U G M and A G M
when those whimps from Soc
Soc, who seem to care little
for the U n i o n t h a t funds
them, brought the meeting to
a close.

PS: I hope that you were
c o n c e r n e d a b o u t s t u d e n t
opinion d u r i n g y o u r " h o l i d a y "
in Ireland.
Dear Mark
Everyone's always writing
to you about Morton's cock-
ups. W e l l , after m u c h i n -
d e p t h research I can now
reveal to your readership that
this is just the area where he
has f a i l e d , this y e a r . M y
suspicions were first aroused
at the time of the attack of
german measles. M s Lindsay
was across from Ireland at the
time, being seemingly wound
a r o u n d M r M o r t o n at a l l
possible times. Yet she failed
to contract the dread disease.
Perhaps the proximity was
not so great?
Being thus sorrowed in love
M r M o r t o n turns to pastures
new. I must admit it was a
stroke of genius persuading
M r M c C a b e to resign simply
so that she'd always be where
M r M o r t o n could easily reach
her (Ms Teller of course), and
all seemed to be going well
until the startling truth was
revealed within the pages of
t h i s v e r y n e w s p a p e r . I n
F E L I X 616 the two stated
they were "not opposed to sex
in principle", suggesting that
in practice it was just not
going on!
In desperation we see M r
M o r t o n running back to his
old love. But even after a
week in Belfast he returns rosy
cheeked and wide awake! Bad
luck Nick!

Dear Sir
A s t h i s a c a d e m i c y e a r
draws to a close I would like
to pay tribute to someone who
has done so much to enrich all
our lives here and in doing so
has become one of the best
loved College personalities. I
refer, of course, to the F E L I X
Editor M a r k Smith.
H i s j o u r n a l i s t i c talent is
such that he has been able to
move us to tears of laughter or
o f o u t r a g e w i t h a s i n g l e
apposite sentence. His pen has
b e c o m e a m i g h t y s w o r d
s c y t h i n g the s e l f - i m p o r t a n t
down to size and puncturing
the pompous. His quicksilver
wit has made Friday mornings
a time ol laughter and happi-
ness with stall and students
joining together in shedding
tears of mirth. Yet between
the lines we can glimpse the
massive intellect which lies
behind the print, the man
w h o s e e d i t o r i a l s m a k e
B e r n a r d L e v i n seem a m a -
teurish and confused. M a r k
Smith and first class journa-
lism, the two are synonymous.
O n this occasion I feel it
only right that I should now
reveal my true identity to the
world. It is:
