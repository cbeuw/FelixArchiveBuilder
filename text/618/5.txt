FELIX gets through a great deal of news in a year but rarely follows any of it up as
"what happened then" is seldom newsworthy. "Bull terrier goes missing!" will always
be more interesting than "Bull terrierfound!" (Mind you, it depends where you find the
bull terrier and who it belongs to!)
However, on this occasion, just to abate your insatiable curiosity, FELIX will break
with tradition to follow up some of this year's stories that actually have a follow-up.
Taken chronologically
From FELIX August 7
C l e m , a yellow and black commercial lorry, the
Mines motorised mascot, is still in bits in the
garage, despite optimistic reports that it would
be back on the road by Christmas.
From FELIX August 7
The Westfield College penguin mascot stolen
by Barney M c C a b e has not yet been returned to
its rightful owners. Shortly after its theft, it
"went missing" from' the I C Union Office.
W e s t f i e l d C o l l e g e have not r e q u e s t e d its
return. Mystery surrounds the whereabouts of
the mascot.
From F E L I X October 5
T h e p a r t i t i o n e r e c t e d o v e r t h e s u m m e r
vacation by the then Deputy President, Barney
M c C a b e , which caused raised eyebrows due
to its £2,000 price-tag, is to be demolished over
the coming summer vacation. Proof that what
goes up must come down.
From F E L I X October 5
The wooden platform and scaffolding erected
outside Weeks Hall to protect passers-by from
falling masonry is still evident. N o action has
been t a k e n or is p l a n n e d by the C o l l e g e
Estates section responsible for the upkeep of
Halls of Residence. Tiles and concrete are still
falling from the higher parts of Weeks Hall,
which was evacuated for a long period several
years ago as the high-alumina cement of which
it is constructed was passing through its most
dangerous phase. However, despite the falling
tiles, Weeks Hall is thought to be safe.
From FELIX October 9
The antique lamps stolen from the City &
Guilds motorised mascot B o have never been
found. Insurance has been claimed but the
lamps are unfortunately irreplaceable.
From F E L I X October 23
The Rag Committee's proposal to change the
constitution to require proofs of the Rag M a g
to be approved by members of the Union
Executive has been passed. This is in order to
a v o i d m o t i o n s t o b a n t h e R a g M a g ' s
distribution proposed by some sections of the
student community who strongly disapprove
of the magazine's contents, as happened this
year resulting in only one third of the 10,000
R a g M a g s b e i n g s o l d . R a g C o m m i t t e e ' s
incompetance in selling it when the ban was
lifted is also a major contributing factor to the
poor sales. The Rag Committee are taking the
defeatest attitude of considering printing only
5,000 Rag Mags next year as opposed to
a t t e m p t i n g t o i m p r o v e t h e i r o w n sales
efficiency.
From F E L I X N o v 13 & F e b 12
That "awfully embarrassing refectory flat" has
not been converted to Union showers or
accommodation, as proposed by J o h n Smith
C B E , the College Secretary. M r Smith has
swept the matter under the carpet and the flat
is still as empty as it has been for the past six
years.
From F E L I X N o v 20, D e c 4 & Jan 22
The proposed merger between IC and Queen
Elizabeth College is now most definitely off. It
was learnt last week that in fact Kings College
is to merge with Q E C .
From F E L I X November 27
The decision to ban all Rag collections for fear
of prosecution as I C U do not have any street
c o l l e c t i o n l i c e n c e s still h o l d s . T h e R a g
Committee have still not managed to obtain
any licences and it seems unlikely any will be
available for next year.

students chasing every place. They
From the Daily Mail, Monday November 30 1981.
From F E L I X December 4
Imperial College is not going " t o take blacks
without A Levels" any more. T h e Daily Mail
devoted considerable space to the decision of
the College to show positive discrimination
towards underprivileged ethnic minorities as
called for in the Scarman Report. The College
has recently quietly shelved the scheme. Peter
Mee, the College Registrar, has pointed out
the obvious difficulties that would be faced by
such students who lacked a good grounding in
science. T h e scheme might have worked for
Arts students, he added, but science and
engineering is too demanding.
This begs the question as to why the College
ever decided to take students without A Levels
in the first place. T o k e n s u p p o r t for t h e
Scarman Report for cheap publicity, later to be
a b a n d o n e d w h e n S c a r m a n w a s forgotten,
perhaps?
From FELIX, January 15
"For God's sake grow up," D r Paul Jowitt was
urged by F E L I X for his pettiness in requesting
his student Southside Penthouse neighbours
to use the stairs instead of the awfully noisy lift.
Dr Jowitt has still not grown up.
From F E L I X January 22
The lunchtime lecture program organised by
the Humanities Department has been saved
from the axe. Lectures will continue as normal
next session; the H . G . Wells Society will be
presenting three of the lectures after a kind
i n v i t a t i o n f r o m J o h n T h o l e , t h e l e c t u r e
program organiser. The three U n i o n lectures
are entitled: (1) Sex; (2) Drugs; (3) Rock'n'Roll.
From F E L I X January 22
The College has taken over control of the
University of London nuclear reactor, situated
at Silwood Park. This was a recommendation
of t h e S w i n n e r t o n - D y e r R e p o r t o n t h e
reorganisation of the University of London.
From FELIX February 5
The thief who stole money from gas meters in
several College flats in L e x h a m Gardens has
never been apprehended.
From F E L I X February 12
The "Supplies to Poland" organisation formed
in College has become the non-event of the
year. A f t e r initial e n t h u s i a s m from many
people including the Rector L o r d Flowers, the
project eventually fizzled out. Perhaps a mite
too ambitious.
From F E L I X February 19
It will come as no surprise to learn that S T O I C
Cameraman G l y n Garside of Elec Eng 2 failed
by mammoth proportions to be elected as
Labour candidate for the Knightsbridge ward
in the London Borough elections o n M a y 6.
From F E L I X April 30
The scheme to add £10 to every Hall resident's
bill in order to support the Sick B a y has
floundered. N o method of raising the £17,000
per annum required to keep the Sick Bay open
has been agreed upon. T h e Sick Bay looks to
remain in a healthy state next year but faces an
uncertain future the year after.
From FELIX M a y 7
N o word has been heard of the IC Union
mascot, Mike, a large 1701b micrometer, since
its theft on M a y 6. N o ransom demands from
other colleges have been received. If Mike is
not found by the end of this term the incident
will be reported to the Police as a theft, even
though the mascot is "violate", meaning it is
intended to be stolen. But who would want a
large micrometer?
From F E L I X M a y 21
T h e c o n t r o v e r s i a l s c h e m e to house t w o
students in what are presently Weeks Hall
single rooms has been scrapped.
That's all, folks! Perhaps you can see why
most stories are never followed up.
