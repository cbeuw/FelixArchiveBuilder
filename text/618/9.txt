We shall not

The proposed move of the Union to Southside
The announcement of a proposal to
move the Student Union from its
current building in Beit Quad to the
Southside Halls was undoubtedly the
most startling news of the year.
Coming, as it did, late in May, there
has been enough time to form an
initial view of the project.
Union President Nick M o r t o n first hinted
at a possible major change for the U n i o n in
his annual report. Under a section entitled
"Morton's M y s t e r y " he said:
Morton's Mystery
I thought I would put this in here to check how many
people really read the whole report. There is a
scheme of major importance to the Union under
discussion in College It may come to light during
my term of office or it may be left to next year's
executive.
F r o m the tone of this paragraph it is
obvious that the scheme had originated in
College and M r M o r t o n gave the impression
that he was not a party to the discussions.
Subsequent to the announcement it was
discovered that the U n i o n President was
first approached by College Secretary J o h n
Smith in March of this year tor his views o n
the idea. M r M o r t o n gave a n enthusiastic
response and also promised not to reveal
the idea to anybody until more details were
available, including plans ior the conversion.
This he did and it was not until M a y 21
that word of ihe move first leaked, only four
d a y s b e f o r e t h e I C U A n n u a l G e n e r a l
Meeting. This effectively meant that the
student union could not hope to take any
form of decision on the matter and would
have to wait until October before respond
ing.
In t h e m e a n t i m e I C U C o u n c i l have
mandated the Executive to investigate the
plans further a n d the College authorities
have a few months to arrange more detailed
proposals.
T h e P l a n s
A i present the move would be initiated in
July 1983 when conversion work o n the
lower levels of Southside would begin. This
work would continue over a two year period
and gradually the Union would be moved
out of its Beit Q u a d building and over to the
new site.
The current U n i o n Building would be
partly t a k e n o v e r by t h e Life S c i e n c e s
Division to expand first year laboratory
facilities and the upper floors would almost
c e r t a i n l y be u s e d as a post e x p e r i e n c e
c e n t r e . T h i s f a c i l i t y w o u l d i n c l u d e
conference rooms and luxury accommoda-
tion for visiting industrial managers on short
courses. It would supposedly run at a profit
and is part of a push for closer cooperation
with industry.
C e n t r e point
College Secretary J o h n Smith is the moving
force behind the whole idea. He has been
c o n s i d e r i n g t h e p o s s i b i l i t y of a p o s t
experience centre for some time; possible
sites have included a new building above
the sports centre and the space beneath the
Southside Halls.
W h e n interviewed by F E L I X M r Smith
e x p l a i n e d that he had been c o n c e r n e d
about the large, under-utilised space below
Southside for a long time. H e said that the
areas were so large that the obvious use for
them was as facilities for the student union.
The vacation of the current U n i o n Building
was an "added bonus" in his view and he
was at pains to express th.it the possibility
for increased space for the U n i o n was the
motive for his proposal. Other advantages
were that a "focal point of student activity"
would be formed in Princes Gardens and
that moie people from Halls would make
better use of the Union.
Reliable sources in the Sherfield Building
give a different view. Most of the College
a d m i n i s t r a t i o n w e r e s u r p r i s e d b y t h e '
proposal, as it was well-known that the
Southside basement was a probable site for
the post-experience centre. Indeed, the
areas had b e e n i n s p e c t e d a n d d e t a i l e d
estimate for conversion prepared. These
turned out to be far more expensive lhan
expected a n d it is this which may have
prompted M r Smith's unexpected genero
sity.
F u n d i n g t h e M o v e
W h e n asked about the cost of the move M r
Smith commented "I'm not talking about
chickenfeed. Something in the region of a
quarter of a million pounds."
It was not made clear wheiher this is the
cost of converting both buildings for their
intended use or just Southside, but in either
case the source of such a sum is uncertain.
M r Smith could not (or would not) tell
F E L I X w h o would pay for the move. H e
simply said " t h e College has ways and
means of raising such amounts".
A n allocation would have to be made in
the 1983/4 College budget, which means
that t h e U n i o n w o u l d have to m a k e a
decision by January of next year. However,
it is almost certain that under the present
economic climate the Universities Grants,
Committee ( U G C ) would not fund such a
move. It is more likely that the College
would he forced to take out a n expensive
l o a n , t h e interest o n w h i c h w o u l d u n -
doubtably affect the Union's allocation for
quite a few years.
A R e a l i s t i c E s t i m a t e ?
A more interesting point is the accuracy of
the cost estimate. Assuming that a full
College Secretary John Smith CBE, the
man behind the Union relocation plan.
conversion of Southside is planned, with
s o m e t h i n g m o r e s u b s t a n t i a l t h a n plast-
erboard partitions a n d some fairly major
structural work, the cost will undoubtably
be m u c h h i g h e r . F E L I X c o n s u l t e d a n
architect for his opinion. H e said that he
could not give a concrete estimate for such
work, but commented that Â£250,000 was
"unlikely" t< cover a conversion of this type.
He added that the present plans looked like
they'd been "knocked up overnight" and
gave little indication of the extenl of work
necessary. A s well as litis we must consider
that building work invariably costs more and
takes longer than expected.
Thus it seems likely that corners would
have to be cut lo save money.
W h o s e d e c i s i o n ?
The summer months will be used to look
more closely at the scheme, and we will
have to wait until next term to voice our
opinion as a body. Already it is clear that
a large section of the student body are in
opposition. M a n y life members who have
been approached about the scheme are
f u r i o u s that t h e U n i o n c o u l d c o n s i d e r
moving from familiar surroundings. M o r e
importantly, many c u r r e n t students are
unconvinced that the move will result in
an improvement of facilities indeed, the
m a i o r i t y t h i n k t h e r e v e r s e m a y w e l l
happen.
The extent to which student opinion will
influence the College is uncertain. Whilst
J o h n Smith maintains that he would not
continue in the face of widespread student
opposition, there is really very little time
for this to be expressed. A U G M could
not r e a l i s t i c a l l y d i s c u s s t h e h a z y p l a n s
w h i c h a r e c u r r e n t l y a v a i l a b l e , a n d full
proposals could be held just out of our
reach until it is too late.
O u r m o v e
What is clear is that the student union
should make a firm decision at the earliest
possible opportunity, even if the college
does not give further details. Nick M o r t o n
may agree 'in principle' with the idea, but
we must show whether students do too.
