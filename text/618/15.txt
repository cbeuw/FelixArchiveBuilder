Peace for Galilee
The utmost Israeli
hyprocrisy
By a Palestinian student
The Middle East, over the past two weeks, has
been experiencing another outbreak of death
and destruction in what seems to be a never
ending struggle between Arab and Israeli. The
Israeli invasion of Lebanon has so far resulted
in an estimated 10,000 people killed, mainly
civilians, and more than 600,000 people have
been made homeless. At a time when Israel
claims to be a missionary of peace, it has
a t t a c k e d a n o t h e r c o u n t r y ' s i n t e g r i t y by
bombing Iraq's nuclear reactor at Osirak, has
defied world opinion by annexing the Golan
Heights, has breached international law by
b u i l d i n g e v e n m o r e s e t t l e m e n t s o n the
occupied West Bank (enhousing as many as
35,000 Jewish settlers), has opposed the basic
fundamentals of human rights by denying the
Palestinians the right to r e t u r n to their
homeland (when the Israeli Law of Return
gives any Jew in the world the immediate
f a c i l i t i e s to s e t t l e ) , has e n r a g e d h u m a n
s e n t i m e n t s by u s i n g live a m m u n i t i o n o n
Palestinian demonstrators in Jerusalem and in
the West Bank (when foam was used to evict
Israeli settlers from the Sinai settlement of
Yamit), and has invited worldwide criticism
and disapproval by committing yet another
act of aggression against the Lebanon. (In
March 1978, 30,000 Israeli soldiers crossed the
border into Lebanon, seized a six mile border
strip and installed puppet Lebanese major
Saad Haddad as its ruler.) At a time when the
victims of the Israeli assault (mainly Lebanese
and Palestinian civilians) face certain death
due to the lack or insufficiency of medical
supplies, the United States vetoed the United
Nations Security Council's draft resolution
calling on Israel to withdraw its forces from the
Lebanon. The resolution would not have made
any difference any way (since over 300
resolutions have been passed against Israel
s i n c e 1948 n o n e of w h i c h h a v e b e e n
implemented) but such an action is irres-
ponsible, the U S being Israel's main supplier of
a i d a n d m i l i t a r y e q u i p m e n t . A s for the
unfounded Israeli claim that their military
offensive is directed towards preventing the
Palestinian shelling of the Israeli settlements, it
should be noted that the ceasefire proclaimed
in the area, and which lasted for almost ten
months, was only breached by the Israeli
continuous bombardment of Lebanese villages
and Palestinian positions prior to the invasion
(the Guardian and The Times, June 10 1982)
and was met by retaliating moves on the part
of the armed forces of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation (PLO).
The recent outbreak of war in the Lebanon
is only a development of the state of affairs
which has in the past been responsible for
t h r e e m a j o r w a r s w h i c h h a v e c l a i m e d
hundreds and thousands of lives. At the crux
of the whole Middle East problem lies the
inescapable question of Palestinian identity.
The Palestinians, a friendly and peace loving
people in nature, have been the victims of a
series of tragic historical incidents which have
left t h e m in an i n s e c u r e a n d defenseless
position. Many of them became refugees living
m a i n l y i n the W e s t B a n k , J o r d a n a n d
L e b a n o n . The P a l e s t i n i a n d i a s p o r a c a m e
a b o u t in 1948 as a d i r e c t r e s u l t of the
establishment of the state of Israel. For years
and years, the q u e s t i o n of a P a l e s t i n i a n
homeland was left in the hands of the United
N a t i o n s a n d the S u p e r P o w e r s w h o only
exploited the situation to gain interests in the
area.
Meanwhile, Palestinian national conscious-
ness grew to a high level and their national
i d e n t i t y was a d o m i n a n t t h e m e of t h e i r
e v e r y d a y life. A l l their daily p r o b l e m s of
survival—finding work, food or shelter, arose
from the fact that they were exiled by the
I s r a e l i s f r o m t h e i r h o m e l a n d . P o l i t i c a l
organisation was initially difficult due to the
fact that the Palestinians dispersed, but the
P L O was later established to embody political,
national, social, cultural and educational as
w e l l as m i l i t a r y o r g a n i s a t i o n s ( s u c h as
commando groups, trade unions, professional
associations, etc....). The P L O took as its duty,
the right of confirming the Palestinian identity
and of ending the degradation and sufferings to
which the Palestinians have been exposed.
The P L O has right from the start gained
p o p u l a r s u p p o r t f r o m the w h o l e of the
Palestinian people who saw in it the means of
regaining their lost but not forgotten identity.
The P L O has representative offices in over 60
c o u n t r i e s i n c l u d i n g B r i t a i n . T h e P L O has
always sought t o w a r d s finding a political
solution to the problem and in 1974, the
chairman of the executive council of the P L O ,
Yassar Arafat, called for an establishment of a
secular democratic state in Palestine (Israel)
where Arabs and Jews could live in peace side
by side. Most of the Palestinians accepted the
idea of a secular state, but sadly the Israelis
rejected it. By this time, the P L O had become
a strong political force in the area.
There has been an observed moderation in
the policies of the P L O over the past few
years. This moderate trend has now been
destroyed by the Israeli aggression. The P L O
leadership was c o n t e m p l a t i n g a peaceful
solution to the conflict and the establishment
of a Palestinian state in the West Bank and the
G a z a strip, but Begin has recently referred to
the West Bank as "Western Eretz Israel" thus
r e v i v i n g the r e v i s i o n i s t n o t i o n that the
"historical land of Israel also included the east
bank of the river Jordan". These Zionist beliefs
of e x p a n s i o n h a v e p r e s e n t e d a m a j o r
s t u m b l i n g b l o c k w h e n e v e r a t t e m p t s for
reconciliation were made. The invasion of
Lebanon and the pounding of refugee camps
will undoubtedly radicalise the policies of the
P L O , and Palestinian feeling is that armed
struggle might prove to be the only way to
liberate the P a l e s t i n i a n h o m e l a n d from a
v i c i o u s a n d u n c o m p r o m i s i n g e n e m y . It is
difficult to see h o w Israel, in its widely
publicised search for peace, could resort to
such means of death and destruction unless
their idea of peace is that of constant war and
of oppression against the Palestinian people as
a whole.
The Israelies claim to have launched their
"Peace for Galilee" attack on the Lebanon in
order to prevent guerilla attacks on Israel. It is
now obvious that this has been used as a
pretext in order to deliver yet another blow to
the independent and free presence of the
Palestinian people as formulated through the
P L O . The underlying objective of Israel is to
impose the autonomy rule on the Palestinian
inhabitants of the West Bank by creating an
alternative leadership other than the P L O .
Israel has been "losing the grip" over the
occupied territories and its 1.1m Palestinian
inhabitants, as demonstrated by the recent
uprisings in Jerusalem and many other West
Bank towns and villages. O n top of this, a
recent poll carried out in the West Bank by an
Israeli public opinion research organisation
(PORI) for Time magazine concluded that
98.2% of the Palestinians on the West Bank
favour an independent Palestinian state and
86% of the population said that they wanted
the state run solely by the P L O (Time, May 24,
1982). So, the Israelis invaded the Lebanon in
order to destroy the P L O as a political and
military force in the area in an attempt to
frustrate the Palestinian people in the West
Bank into finding alternative representation.
Previous attempts to do so (such as deposing
pro P L O mayors) proved unsuccessful.
Heavy civilian casualties have been the
direct result of Israeli shelling of the Lebanese
towns and villages. In their venture the Israelis
h a v e i n c r e a s e d the g r i e v a n c e s of the
Palestinian people and this in turn will lead to
more violent outbreaks and to guerilla attacks
by the Palestinians on Israeli interests within
and perhaps outside the boundaries of Israel.
(The P L O in its desperation might be pushed
to revert to its early tactics of hijacking,
political assassinations, etc..) The Israelis are
not destroying a "few terrorist pockets" that
endangered their daily livelihood but they are
trying to put an end to a national movement of
a p e o p l e w h o a r e s t r u g g l i n g for self-
determination within a political situation that is
driving them into desperation. Ironically, the
Jews have in the past faced that same situation
yet they refuse to identify with the aspirations
of the Palestinian people. The persecution of
the Jews in Europe has ended but that of the
Palestinians has started. Israel has proved to
be a large c o n c e n t r a t i o n c a m p for the
P a l e s t i n i a n A r a b s w h o a r e c o n t i n u a l l y
h a r a s s e d , i m p r i s o n e d a n d t o r t u r e d for
e x p r e s s i n g " u n f a v o u r a b l e " political views.
C o l l e c t i v e p u n i s h m e n t has been d i r e c t e d
against P a l e s t i n i a n nationalists a n d their
families, books have been banned, houses
were d e m o l i s h e d , land has been s e i z e d ,
newspapers are subjected to heavy censorship,
demonstrators have been shot, all of which
characterise the Zionist aspect of the State of
Israel. T h e P a l e s t i n i a n struggle has been
directed towards ending this oppression and to
those who are fighting for the realisation of this
aim the following tribute is presented:
A word to those who died
For the twins Lebanon and Palestine
A word to those mutilated by the war
And to those renewing the title of refugee
Once more and with no end
To the people who take suffering
With their daily bread
To the people that stood
Against terror and oppression
To you all I say these words:
You are the new Gods
And with your blood
You shall write a new testament
In the history of mankind
You are a consolation
To the oppressed of every nation
You are a curse on tyrants everywhere
And if I were to worship any Gods
I will worship you
For you are the real Gods of Justice
And I beg forgiveness
Since my biggest sin is living
When thousands of you are dead.
