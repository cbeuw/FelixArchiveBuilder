Dear Sir
I was flabbergasted with
the two letters published last
week concerning the Falk-
la,nds. I c o u l d take t h e i r
pathetic a n d unconsidered
arguments apart, one by one.
However, I will not waste
your time or mine in doing so
as, unlike M r Shaw, I do not
underestimate the intelligence
of I C students and know that
they w i l l see the s t r a i g h t
through the left wing shit that
pours from his mouth without
a moment's thought.
Tours sincerely
Paul Simion
Dear Mark
O r s h o u l d I say " D e a r
Fiona and Graeme" as I am
a d d r e s s i n g this m a i n l y to
them, re their letters of issue
617. Both obviously disagree
w i t h o u r liberation of the
Falkland Islands. I won't go
into the history yet again, but
would like to make a few
points.
I must assume that both
letters were w r i t t e n before
Goose Green and Darwin had
been liberated but, even so, I
must take exception to Graeme
Shaw's questions.
"Couldn't the Falklanders
have suffered the presence of
the Argentinian troops for a
c o u p l e o f m o n t h s w h i l e
negotiations were in progress?
Surely it would be less incon-
venient for them than a war?"
I suggest he puts those same
two questions to the inhabi-
tants of the above settlements,
who had been locked up for
over a month, one of them in
shackles, while their homes
were r a n s a c k e d a n d t h e i r
v i l l a g e f i l l e d w i t h l e a k y
napalm bombs and unstable
ammo dumps. Their reception
' of the Paras clearly shows
which option they preferred.
Not forgetting the people who
are incarcerated in the deten-
tion camp at Fox Bay.
Whilst I agree with both of
, t h e m , a n d the Pope, that
armed conflict is no way to
: settle disputes, I must remind
t h e m that it takes two to
negotiate, but only one to start
lighting (and they started).
W e have been negotiating
w i t h A r g e n t i n a for m a n y
years, which is hardly "always
refusing" is it Fiona? We have
also been trying to negotiate
(plus the imposition ol sanc-
tions) since before the Argen-
tinian invasion took place
(Resolution "502" was passed
before April 2) to ask them to
leave. Have they left? No they
haven't, and have continued
to build up in the mean time:
flouting " 5 0 2 " for the past
two months.
Both cite the case of Nor-
thern Ireland and the people
who wish to be part of the
Republic, they both forget
that the majority of Ulster's
population, as do all (but one)
of the Falklanders, wish to
remain British. They should
not be ignored either.
Just because the U K may
have been less than perfect in
past doesn't give Argentina the
right to walk into any territory
they desire (including parts of
Chile and Antartica). But,
w h i l e o n t h e s u b j e c t o f
empires, many of the C o m -
m o n w e a l t h of N a t i o n s are
backing our sanctions, whilst
others r e m a i n n e u t r a l . So
whilst our empire may have
not been perfect, many who
were part of it do not wish to
dissociate from us, so we
can't be all bad.
It is not hypocrisy to feel
sorry for those, a n d their
r e l a t i v e s w h o have d i e d .
Nobody in their right mind
wants a war, but there arc
cases where it may be the
lesser of many evils. If blatant
annexation of territory and
o p p r e s s i o n of p e o p l e , is
allowed to proceed unres-
trained, there is no knowing
where it will end up. T h e
Second World W a r started by
H i t l e r g e t t i n g a w a y w i t h
Austria, Czechoslavakia and
Poland.
Finally, it is worth noting
that the Falklands prior to
April 2 were comparatively
undefended. Argentina mar-
ched in with 10,000 troops as
opposed to 30 marines and
1,800 inhabitants. This must
surely explode the myth that
just because a place is u n -
defended then nobody will
attack it. This, as has W W 2 ,
a n d m a n y other conflicts
throughout history, shows
that the opposite is true: If
y o u ' r e u n d e f e n d e d , a n d
someone wants to invade,
they will do so. History has
also shown that you can talk
till you're blue in the face, but
the invader will not leave.
This does not mean, however,
that you mustn't try, there is
always hope. But in the end if
they will not leave after being
"spoken to nicely" they must
be "shown the d o o r " , and in
no uncertain terms if neces-
sary.

Dear Sir
Has M a r g a r e t T h a t c h e r
not yet realised that she
would have saved a lot ol time
by " n u k i n g " the "Falvinas"
oil the bloody map in the first
place?
This would have resolved
the tricky problem ol handing
the Falklands over to Argen-
tina without popular uproar
a problem that has baffled
successive British governments
over the years. It would also,
I understand, have saved the
lives of m a n y m o r e "first
class" British citizens than
what has now ensued.
Of course she would still
have to think of a way ot
hiding her disastrous home
and economic policy but I'm
sure John Nott or Lady D i
can come up with another
brilliant plan.
To finish, had she done this
I'm sure we all realise the
w o r l d would have been a
much Salter place with people
l i v i n g in mutant harmony.
Anyway the French dis-
covered the stupid things so
"rendaere Caesare quae sunt
Caesaris", (mispelt), what?
