Lindley weighs anchor
Captain John William Garbutt
Lindley RN is to voluntarily
retire at Christmas.
T h e C a p t a i n boarded H M S
Sherlield on M o n d a y , November
24, 1975 to take on the newly
created post of Domestic Secre-
tary, who is in overall charge of
Bookings, Refectories, Halls of
R e s i d e n c e a n d S e c u r i t y . H e
p r e v i o u s l y h a d a l o n g a n d
d i s t i n g u i s h e d career w i t h the
R o y a l N a v y — h e rose to the rank
of C a p t a i n a n d was a N a v a l
Aide-de-camp to the Queen. H e
was C o m m a n d e r of H M S C o c h -
r a n e , u s u a l l y k n o w n as the
Fleet Accommodation Centre of Rosyth N a v a l Base.
His activities at I C went virtually unnoticed by F E L I X until the
s u m m e r of 1980 w h e n he s u d d e n l y c a m e i n t o the l i m e l i g h t .
Throughout that year he made numerous appearances and it became
clear that the C a p t a i n was not the model of efficiency and diplomacy
we had expected.
T h e C a p t a i n was welbknown for his numeracy, but when asked how
many times he had appeared in F E L I X he said " I don't know, I don't
stand and count 'em, and it's not up to me to count them either....but
there were quite a lot."
Captain Lindley is not 65.
ASTMS Dispute
Laboratory Technicians have been picketing entrances to I C since last
Thursday in support of a national pay and conditions claim.
Last week some gates were manned from 9:00am to 5:00pm in an
attempt to stop supplies reaching College. This week pickets have been
on duty from 7:00am to 6:00pm at more entrances.
The I C dispute is part oPa national campaign. T h e technicians want
a 12% wage increase, a reduction of 2'/._, hours in the week to 35 hours,
and three days more annual leave.
They have been offered 4% for those over 21 and 0% for trainees.
T h e national negotiating body recommended selective strike action
ol not less than 3 hours per week and this has been given a "guerilla'
interpretation here by the Association of Scientific Technical and
Mangerial Stall' ( A S T M S ) who represent the I C lab technicians. This
action will continue until the dispute is settled.
M r Ian French, I C A S T M S Branch C h a i r m a n , said that the picket
had been "incredibly successful" with 75% of goods turned back. After
a deputation went to the post office workers they agreed not to cross
picket lines or make deliveries of mail outside their normal hours
A S T M S members who are not lab technicians can choose whether
or not to take part in the action.
M r French added that the aim of the action was to influence College
administrators to support their claim at national level. However the
College have said that they do not believe it is in their interest to make
their views known publicly as it might compromise their side of the
negotiating committee.
II the dispute dragged on, he said, then unfortunately it would be
hard not to effect students, .along with the refectories and general
deliveries. A S T M S realised that their strongest weapon against College
was to disrupte examinations, but have refrained from doing so.
Effects of the dispute have already been felt. Deliviries of beer to the
H o l l a n d C l u b were stopped on the lirst morning. L i q u i d nitrogen
supplies were drying up. This might adversely alfect chemical plant
which would be inclined to blow up if not kept cool. Last Thursday
technicians picketed a meeting of French University Principals at 170
Queensgate.
M r French told F E L I X that the dispute might last until at least July
1. That date was chosen by the employers to discuss conciliation with
A C A S .
M r Davidson, Personnel Secretary, was unavailable for comment
Piggy brings the house down!
D r Brian Levitt, the new M a y o r of Kensington and Chelsea, has soon
landed in hot water following the demolition of the old Kensington
T o w n H a l l last Friday.
T h e Greater L o n d o n C o u n c i l are furious that his T o r y council
decided to demolish the 105 year-old building and intend to take legal
action if possible. Kensington and Chelsea C o u n c i l say that the
redevelopment of the site will bring in revenue of four to five million
pounds, but according to The Times Diary (Monday, June 16) the
C o u n c i l seem to have forgotten that they had already given planning
p e r m i s s i o n for a c o n v e r s i o n of the o l d b u i l d i n g . T h e present
development w i l l result i n a loss of 11,000 square feet of floor
space—worth about three million pounds at present prices.
So the old scheme would have been more profitable without
knocking the building down!
Jasper collapses
in heroic record
smash bid!

Sunday, J u n e 6, while attempting
to set a new record for a single
c o n t i n u o u s professional r a d i o
show.
Jasper started his programme
at 4:00pm on Friday, J u n e 4, at
the I C R a d i o S t u d i o b e l o w
S o u t h s i d e a n d l a s t e d a l m o s t
f o r t y - t h r e e hours; the r e c o r d
still stands at forty-eight and a
half hours. Fortunately for Jasper
former Station M a n a g e r Dave
Fuller was present to rush him to
St. Stephens Hospital but he was
released later that evening.
T h e collapse is thought to have
been caused by Jasper drinking
too m u c h coffee and not eating
enough solid food.
The, present Station M a n a g e r
Neil Sykes would like to thank all
those students from the Halls of
Residence who helped during the
record attempt.
