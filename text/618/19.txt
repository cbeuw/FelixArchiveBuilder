This year seems to have slipped by quicker
than it takes to erect and demolish a partition.
At the end of a sabbatical year as F E L I X
Editor it seems appropriate (for some reason)
to l o o k b a c k a n d a s s e s s the U n i o n ' s
performance. Besides that, it is my last chance
to say the things I've been meaning to say all
year.
The College
It would be all too easy to fabricate stories
about gross cock-ups and the waste of money
at Imperial College. But I really don't have to.
I have always been surprised that one of the
world's top educational institutions, can at
times be run so badly. The College authorities
are in theory the guardians of our welfare.
Their job is to ensure that we receive an
adequate education in our chosen fields and
that we have reasonable facilities for living,
eating and recreation. They are paid to do this
and nothing else.
What do we get? After four years at IC I
think that on the academic side we are treated
fairly well. Most undergraduate courses are
reasonable, although the workload on some
(particularly engineering subjects) is a bit
tough. I can't vouch for P C s but I'm sure the
situation is not too bad.
Apart from this we have a mixed deal.
Because of the size of the College we are
afforded fairly generous Union facilities, but we
suffer from having an a b y s m a l refectory
service (which sinks further into the depths
every year) inadequate residence facilities and
we're hampered by bumbling administrators.
Refectories
I've not really indulged in petty personal
sniping at Victor Mooney and his cronies, but
the one thing in the forefront of my mind which
a b s o l u t e l y r e e k s of i n e f f i c i e n c y are the
refectories. M r Mooney takes the attitude that
F E L I X digs up stories about him and his work
when there is nothing else to do. This is not so,
but he uses this as a shield and has become
hardened- to criticism over the past twenty
nine years.
During my four years at College I've seen
the refectories go from being appalling to
absolutely appalling. T h e r e are a captive
clientelle (in more ways than one!) of over
4,000 students, all of w h i c h want to eat
reasonable food at decent prices. Mooney
provides neither and instead of improving
facilities he now takes the novel approach of
closing them down. I realise that he has a hard
job and probably attempts to work very hard,
but after twenty-nine years of failure he should
call it a day.
I'm not a catering manager and can't offer
complete solutions, but I'm sure some young
blood could. So pack your bags Vic and retire.
Captain Lindley
T a l k i n g of w h i c h M r M o o n e y ' s superior
C a p t a i n L i n d l e y ( D o m e s t i c S e c r e t a r y ) is
retiring at Christmas (see news page).
Those who were here last year witnessed
the emergence of Captain Lindley into the
limelight. M y predecessor had a great deal of
fun at his expense and succeeded in showing
how awful senior administrators can be. All of
the criticisms of old Salty are, to a certain
extent, justified and he typifies the breed of
College administrator who believes that IC
w o u l d r u n p e r f e c t l y if it wasn't for the
students. T h e S h e r f i e l d B u i l d i n g s e e m s
stocked up with quite a few of these characters
and whilst I'm certain nobody really wishes the
Captain any bad will personally, we'd all be
better off if he took a few others (including
Mooney) with him.
Continuity
The great advantage which College have over
the Union is, of course, continuity. Union
officers are only elected for a year at a time
and the College use their years of experience
to full advantage.
Some years can be pretty rough for the
Sherfield Building. If the President, or F E L I X
Editor for that matter, can shout loud enough
and get the support of students, then the
College can be forced into doing just about
a n y t h i n g . Forced m a y s o u n d b a d , b u t
believe me it is necessary when dealing with
the Sherfield Building. The problem is that
more often than not students are a dis-
organised rabble, most of which are more
interested in being deadly boring or getting
pissed than improving their lot.
Student Union officials often fall into this
category—either that or they're so afraid of
getting their fingers burnt that they allow the
College to walk all over t h e m . The best
example this year must be Nick Morton and
the proposed move to Southside.
Nick hasn't been a bad President, in fact on
the whole (despite some major differences of
opinion) he has been pretty good. His problem
has been that he is far too good natured and
optimistic to spot College pulling a fast one. As
I've said to him on many occasions, it is no use
giving a blanket approval for College schemes
(like the Southside plan) because you're
immediately in a weak bargaining position.
What sort of concessions can you gain by
agreeing outright?
At the same time College Secretary John
Smith can be likened to a foot in the door
encyclopaedia salesman. I think it's quite
obvious that the College would really like to
get their hands on the Union Building to use as
part of Life Sciences and a post-experience
centre and hence have come up with this
marvellous scheme. John Smith has success-
fully sold the idea to Nick Morton, claiming
that it was for the Union's own good that
College want to spend £250,000 on the move
and that the vacation of the present building is
just an added bonus for them.
If there is no firm opposition to this idea
then the College will ease it through over two,
three or even four years without anybody
really noticing. Full plans, estimates of costs
and so on will be held just out of our reach until
it is too late—"The nature of the work is such
that we cannot tell you exactly that at this
time," we will be told and eventually the tide of
C o l l e g e b u r e a u c r a c y will c o n v i n c e the
students union of two or three year hence that
the idea has already been approved and that
there is no turning back.
I hope that if full plans are not available next
October and if we cannot be certain that the
College will deliver the goods (and let's face it,
on their record can we afford to take that
risk?) then you will all voice your opinions and
make sure we keep our facilities.
The Union
Most students seem to take little interest in
U G M s and I can't blame them. I've attempted
to keep F E L I X relevant to student affairs,
concentrating mainly on internal matters, but
the mass of irrelevant politically orientated
motions at U G M s only serves to increase the
boredom that the officers' reports inevitably
promote. There is nothing wrong with noble
causes, but IC Union is hardly the United
Nations and some of the people who propose
these items could be better employed with
subjects a little closer to home.
To be quite honest I sometimes wonder why
anybody gives a damn about the Union. So few
people take any real interest and it usually falls
to them to sort out the mess others leave
behind. Coping with some of the moronic
officials from Sherfield is pure hell—most
navvies w o u l d put them to shame in the
intelligence stakes.
But despite all this there seems to be some
r e w a r d s in w o r k i n g for the U n i o n . T h e
admiration of your fellow students isn't worth a
tinker's cuss, but most employers recognise
that it is better to take on people who have
exhibited a lively character and community
s p i r i t , r a t h e r t h a n s o m e of the d r e a r y
individuals who can do nothing but work. That
doesn't apply to many of you (thank God!) but
as the employment situation has gotten worse
there has been a marked decline in parti-
cipation.
Nick Morton
This year's President has his faults, but I hope
people recognise that he's been a lot better
than most. His strength and weakness is his
good nature, which lays him opent to attack
from people like me and also makes him trust
the College.
Nick has certainly worked hard for the
U n i o n but I believe that his a p p r o a c h of
cooperating with College (and keeping things
quiet for long periods) is fundamentally wrong.
We cannot trust College to do anything
without a little gentle persuasion and we have
to maintain a bargaining position. They will
take advantage of inexperience and misplaced
trust at almost every opportunity so if you're
not told about anything by your elected
officials then it suits them fine. I hope that I've
managed to throw a few things into light this
year and also that you'll show an appropriate
reaction.
Remember that a little interest from a lot of
people can go a long way.
Thanks
There is far too little space to thank all those
p e o p l e w h o h a v e b e e n of h e l p to me
throughout my four years.
Firstly thanks to the Physics department
(especially Robin Smith and Brian Morgan) for
putting up with me and to all those in R C S U in
my first year—it was a great year.
This year's staff have been a great help:
thanks to Peter Rodgers, Lesley Horrocks
(who is still a mega-star), Pallab Ghosh, Martin
S. Taylor, Steve Goulder, David Rowe, David
Britton, Ramzi Shammas, Nick Thexton, Jane
Williams, N . Willson, Nick Bedding, Caroline
Godin, Soheel, Dave Gill, Alistair Kirk, the
disgustingly funny Rich Archer (sorry more
haven't gone in!), Dave Jago, Jes, M o , Stuart,
D a n u t a , P a u l Bailey, Izy and the regular
collators, and of course Maz Fellows and Ian
Morse, I shall miss you all.
A s p e c i a l m e n t i o n has to go to m y
predecessor Steve Marshall for a great deal of
fun and to Mrs Vary for always having a smile
at tea time.
I'll soon be off into the wide world of work,
but my ties with Imperial College will never be
fully severed.
Until next time—farewell!
