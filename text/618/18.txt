H i there all you fun people, we
(Phil and I) thought it wouldn't be
a bad idea if we tell you the rest of
College what fun things we have
all done a n d are going to do.
Life o C I -y R e m e m b e r all those terrific
Report f parties at the beginning of each
term? They went just fine. The last
one was a bit tricky with just a few
of us to clear up, with Phil our
beloved super-hack attacking a
door in a moment of anger.
Of course we don't get a single penny from any union (hint) or the
division, so we have to break even if not better, which we have done.
O n e of the events we spent money on was the Life Sciences Revue,
just before Easter. Well that was an amazingly original idea and I think I
should get a prize for it and pulling the whole thing off, but then, I did win
a pen. W e all had fun that night, hoping that Christine's daring costume
wouldn't slip, but being disappointed anyway. All the same we raised a
fair few quid for R a g and we're already planning another revue for
C h r i s t m a s . D o c o m e o u t of the c u p b o a r d a l l y o u P a m e l a R h y s
Riddihoughs!
Of course you didn't come to College just for the social life, we all need
some six or eight hours of sleep a day, and I think I would be correct to
say that most of us prefer to do it during lecture and lab time. T h e
academic reps are of course concerned that this time should be as
peaceful as possible. Most of their work is done in committees no one
attends, so academic news is sparce and secretive, but I do hear C B is to
be cut into two, and I also hear the faintest whisper that matters will
improve on the degree front.
Remember the elections for dep reps? Y e s y o u d o — a load of idiots
stood up during tea-break and disturbed everyone. I am ashamed to say
fun people that you didn't all vote, and even more ashamed to say that
most of you seemingly voted Peter Burt—if you know how this was done
I'd like to know about it. But of course we love our new dep rep, just
as we loved dear old Nathan (well his mother may have) and we should all
give Pete's mother our support.
The new Divisional Students Committee met for the first time the
other day, we argued quite a bit, which is better than previous meetings
when there was no one to argue with, but we did sort out a few things.
W e discussed what to do with our money or more to the point where
to put it. A man called Marco, with a suspicious complexion, said he had
a good property deal going in Southside, but we thought better of it. Mike
is now in charge of the money and he says he'll keep it in a hole in the side
of the river. Phi! however says that if ever we are passing his place we can
drop in for a battle of vodka and a sweatshirt anytime.
W e also discussed the next Life S c i Party. This is of course at the
beginning of next term, the first Tuesday in fact. A chappie from the
Union called Greenpiece or something said it wouldn't be, and also that
we couldn't have our own tickets, but Peter sorted the bugger out (he
waved his finger at him, behind his back).
The Division likes to give the freshers a spot of tea before the party, so
they give us some loot to buy food and hire the J C R . Somehow we have
to come up with a lot of butties, Neil says he'll organise this bit, and any
that help him will get some tea. I have taken over the bar from D a n and I'll
offer coffee to any that help me. If you're big an' ugly, and I don't believe
Danka is, Pete will offer you biscuits, tea and coffee, if you help o n the
door. W e do need your help because we still need oodles more money to
do the things we'd like to do for you.
We'll be getting some T and sweatshirts next term so order your size
now.
Last point; the first and second year exams both finish on Thursday 24.
The Royal College of Music bar opens at 4:00pm. Need I say more?
You'll come back now
love
Geoff
PS: The whole College may be glad to hear, and particularly Debbie, that
Matt Smith has been locked up by College authorities at Silwood.
Despite a breakout during Rag Fete it is otherwise safe to say that all
organised student bodies have a better chance of remaining so.

Rag
A s you should have read in Mary's
letter last F E L I X , I a m hoping to
change Rag's approach to collect-
ing next year, by collecting on
charities' street licenses. T h e
C C U s should still be able to do all
the s t u n t s t h e y h a v e i n t h e
past—this time without getting
arrested! However, this will mean
that our designated charities are
bound to get less money, but I
hope to cushion this by making
more in Rag Week. The best way
is by some sort of megastunt, for
which we can be sponsored—
preferably by companies as well as
people, and attract media publici-
ty.
W e also need an emblem for
n e x t y e a r : t h i s y e a r it w a s a
kangaroo for Ragaroo 82, but I
d o n ' t w a n t n e x t y e a r t o be
Wallaby 83. (It doesn't have to
r h y m e n e c e s s a r i l y , o r be a
marsupial.)
To lure you away from any
remaining revision or post-exam
celebrations (?), there will be a
prize for any replies which we
adopt or adapt. (Subject to m y
discretion.)
I would also like to hear any
s u g g e s t i o n s f o r n e x t y e a r ' s
charities, with reasons, please.
Please help relieve the strain o n
my tiney mind by replying to the
Rag pigeonhole in I C U .

Dancing Club
This has been another successful year for IC's thriving Dancing Club,
both in terms of team results and an enthusiastic membership.
There were three major competitions during the year, the first of which
was the Southern Ball hosted by Bristol University, in which the team
was fourth overall. A t the Inter-Varsity Ball in Southampton, I C were a
disappointing eleventh, but this did not do justice to the quality of the
team's dancing. The culmination of the team's success was at the Varsity
Match Ball hosted by Oxford. Simon Carter and Melanie Cooper were
runners-up in the O p e n Ballroom competition and the Latin American
c o m p e t i t i o n w a s w o n by R i c h a r d W i l l i a m s a n d S a l l y B a r t o n .
Congratulations to them and many thanks also for the keen involvement
of Vicky Welsh and Alan Logan (quickstep) and Rebecca May and Alan
Edwards (jive).
Members are reminded that lessons continue until Monday, June 21,
and those w h o are interested in summer lessons should contact
committee members before the end of term. Those w h o would like to
compete for the team next year should approach committee members
soon so that the team may be organised.
O n behalf of the incoming committee I would like to thank the outgoing
committee for their excellent work and sustained commitment to the
club throughout the year.

R e c o m m e n d e d R e a d i n g L i s t s , there a r e still a n u m b e r of
tutors/teachers/lecturers w h o have not let us have these lists
back yet. M a y I stress once again how important it is for us to
have this information to ensure that the books you want for your
students to have are in stock at the start of term. Once we get
that information, we can send out the orders. Consider though
that it takes on average twenty working days from U K publishers
and ninety working days from outside the U K for our orders to be
processed, you can see how little time we have. If by chance you
recommend a title that is not available, we have to inform you and
an alternative found. This is all time consuming, so please your
help in getting lists, correctly filled in, back to us is of the utmost
importance.
