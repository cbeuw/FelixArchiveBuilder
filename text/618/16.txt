Have you seen our mascot?
Mike is the mascot of Imperial College Union, a large replica of a
micrometer weighing 170lbs. Mike went missing in the early
hours of the morning of Thursday, May 6, 1982.
So far no news of its whereabouts has been received nor any
ransom demanded. The mascot is violable and as such it is
expected that other colleges will attempt to remove it. However,
if no news of its whereabouts is received by 5:30pm, Friday,
June 25, then the incident will be treated as theft. The Police will
be called in to investigate and this could lead to a prosecution.
Any news of its position, present, or since May 6 should be
forwarded to Marco Ledwold, Imperial College Union, Prince
Consort Road, London SW7.
A cautionary tale
Beware of Moonies
I arrived at the bus station in Denver after
seven weeks working and travelling in the
U S A . Dishevelled, tired and a little fed up with
American and Americans, I booked a room at
the Y W C A intending to find a job to see me
through the next two weeks before travelling
on to California.
A s I gathered my bits and pieces together
and worked out the route, a young guy walked
up to me and asked if I needed any help. His
name was Ross and we chatted for a while
about my travels and life back in England. H e
then explained that he was from an Inter-
n a t i o n a l C o m m u n i t y i n D e n v e r c a l l e d
U N I C A P (Unification C o m m u n i t y A c t i o n
Programme). They had an English lecturer
working with them and would I like to come
back for dinner and meet them all. I said " Y o u
are not those dreaded Moonies, are you?"
whereupon he smiled and said no, just a
Christian community doing voluntary work. I
went back in the transport provided to an
ordinary looking house where I was greeted
e n t h u s i a s t i c a l l y a n d made to feel v e r y
welcome. The programme commenced with
us s t a n d i n g i n a c i r c l e , s i n g i n g a s o n g ,
i n t r o d u c i n g o u r s e l v e s o n e - b y - o n e a n d a
moment of prayer or silent meditation before
breaking for dinner. After dinner the members
put on a little entertainment before the leader
of the "family" as they called themselves,
spoke about the ills of the world and invited us
all (about seven new recruits) up to their house
in the mountains to hear how they were trying
to change them. W e were shown some slides
and during the refreshments that followed,
they all tried to persuade us individually to go
up. I refused but they put me up that night (a
sleeping bag on the floor as they always slept),
took me to the employment agency the next
morning, showed me around the city and
invited me back for the same programme only
this time I decided to go up to the mountains
with them. "Not much happens in Denver,"
by Linda Pearce
they said, "you might just as well come up to
our house for the weekend and see something
of the rockies."
We were woken next morning at 7:30 by a
song and went out onto the mountainside to
do some exercises and sing a few songs. There
were about five new members but we were
never left alone to talk and were accompanied
everywhere by a member of the group. Every
mealtime each n e w recruit w a s asked to
" s h a r e " something about themselves until
eventually, inner-most secrets were divulged.
E v e r y e v e n i n g s u p p o s e d l y c o n f i d e n t i a l
"reflections" were written and read by which
method the group new exactly what the recruit
was thinking. It seemed churlish and bad
manners to refuse to do as asked since the
group were so enthusiastic and nice. Each day
we had three, three-hour lectures, with a long
hike at lunchtime and games inbetween and in
the evening. Each moment was regimented
and there was never a moment of privacy, not
even in the bathroom. The last lecture on
Sunday evening divulged their belief that the
M e s s i a h w a s o n e a r t h f o l l o w e d b y a n
emotional testimony from the group leader
and another singsong as happened before and
after every meal. The leader and my spiritual
parent (Ross) immediately came over to me
afterwards and urged me to stay for another
five days to hear more about their beliefs (after
all, who wants to have missed the messiah). I
agreed to stay, along with four others.
T h e f o l l o w i n g w e e k ( a n d t w o w e e k s
afterwards) pursued the same pattern save we
had t w o lectures a n d d i d h o u s e w o r k or
woodchopping in the extra time available.
During the week I asked twice more who the
group were and both times they denied they
were Moonies. O n Friday, the seventh day, it
was revealed that the leader of the group, and
by implication the Messiah, was Rev S u n
Myung Moon. I was shocked but they justified
the deception by the fact that no one would
stay if they said outright w h o they were
because of their bad press. They called this
"heavenly deception" in the belief that the
ends—whether money or recruits—justifies
the means.
Five weeks later, having spent two weeks
picking up rubbish, fundraising or recruiting, I
phoned home and told my parents that I was
staying in America to work for God. They flew
out the next day believing I had been kept and
drugged but soon found out the brainwashing
techniques e m p l o y e d a n d hired a depro-
grammer on arrival. It was five days before
they could locate me by getting my sister to
phone from Germany to verify I was in the
Moonie house and phoning them in a call box
around the corner, early Monday morning. A t
9:00am my father simply walked into the house
as we were all standing in a circle introducing
ourselves. 1 believed that he came for the day
and left with him promising to be back at 4:00.1
got into the car they said they had hired and
we went for a two and a half hour drive
"sightseeing", had lunch, then called into the
drivers 'office'. They then announced that this
was in fact a deprogramming and the two
guys—'trainee drivers'—were security men. I
was talked to for about six hours by the
deprogrammers and an ex-Moonie. B y that
time I decided I did not want to return but
needed to find out who was speaking the truth,
the Unification C h u r c h or the deprogrammers.
The next day I was whisked off to rehabilitate
for a week in Virginia where I slept for three
days a n d read all about the cult. T h e n I
returned home to my studies which I have
now, two years later, completed.
A l l i n a l l it w a s q u i t e a t r a u m a t i c
experience a n d not one I would wish upon
anyone. It took me a long while to rid myself
of t h e g u i l t a n d f e a r of t u r n i n g m y
back on the Messiah, if in fact it was true,
despite the fact that I knew it could not be so. 1
am now a member of a group called E M E R G E
to help people come to terms with coming out
of a cult—adjust to the real world again and to
warn others of the dangers they pose and the
evil they represent. T h e Moonies and other
cults are not only in the U S but all over the
w o r l d . T h e y entrap vulnerable, idealistic,
intelligent young people and turn them into
mental slaves, working eighteen hours per day
in the belief that it is work for G o d enriching
the world, when in fact it is merely enriching
one man—the leader of the cult in his personal
quest for money and power.
