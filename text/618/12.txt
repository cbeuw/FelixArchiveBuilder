The Taming of the Shrew by William
Shakespeare. Presented by the New
Shakespeare Company and directed by
Richard Digby Day. Open Air Theatre,
Regents Park.
The production of The Taming of the Shrew
which opens the season at the Open A i r
T h e a t r e in R e g e n t s P a r k is a l m o s t too
colourful and too comic to describe in words.
It just simply has to be seen. The action takes
place in Padua and Verona but the- director,
Richard Digby Day, has set the play in newly
liberated Italy at the end of the last war, with
very minor alterations in the text.
A m o n g t h e h i l a r i o u s a s s o r t m e n t of
characters therefore, are various American
army c h a p s a n d a s u p e r b l y c o m i c g u m -
chewing helmeted GI played by Paul Raffield '
(as Biondello).
The amorous passions of several of these
characters are brought to the boil by two very
beautiful women: Katherine, a haughty Italian
goddess played by Kate O ' M a r a , and her more
approachable sister, Bi^nca, played by Janet
Spencer-Turner (the sight of whom alone
justifies the cost of the ticket). The ill-tempered
Katherine is persued by the almost mad dandy,
Petruchio, played by Christopher Neame, and
it is the strange alchemy that allows Petruchio
to t r a n s f o r m K a t h e r i n e f r o m a p r i c k l y
unwanted woman to an obedient and noble
wife that essentially provides the quintessence
of the play. The delicious comedy of The
Taming of the Shrew exposes great streaks of
violence and roughness, however.
The outstanding characteristic of apparently
all productions at the Open Air Theatre is the
almost perfect choice of players to fit the parts;
in many cases this could not possibly be
bettered. T h e theatre is a vastly u n d e r -
estimated establishment both from the artistic

point of view and from the sheer enjoyment
value obtained, and it is indeed a very lucky
thing that the theatre was saved from closure
at the end of last summer. (The Arts Council,
withdrew its grant but subsequently replaced it
after bowing to public pressure. This contrasts
with the G L C who doubled their contribution
in the last two years and are now the theatre's
major supporter.)
This year is the theatre's Golden Jubilee
S e a s o n a n d as w i t h p a s t s e a s o n , t w o
Shakespeare plays and works by Bernard Shaw
are on offer. This summer sees The Taming of
Shrew and A Midsummer Night's Dream by
Shakespeare, interspersed with a Shaw double
bill c o n s i s t i n g of The Dark Lady of the
Sonnets and The Admirable Bashville.
The usual refreshments and gastronomic
delights are available this summer: soups, hot
dogs, salads, cakes, hamburgers, Bratwurst
sausages, strawberries, raspberries and ice-
cream. The wine bar serves the traditional
Regent's Park specialities including mulled
wine (delicious) and Puck's Fizz, joined this
year by 'Shrewdriver' and 'Petruchio Punch'.
The bar, barbecue and buffet open two hours
" before the performance and the bars remain
open till midnight. This, and the magnificent
setting of the theatre in a leafy green hollow in
the park and an enchanting classical building
at the rear of the natural stage w h i c h is
gradually lit up as the evening sun sets behind,
makes virtually any trip to this theatre a
superb evening out.

two week season at Sadlers Wells on Tuesday
with a programme of four works.

ingenious work, with music by Brian Eno.
