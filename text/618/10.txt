S c a r a m o u c h e
the final problems
Preamble
Hello, good evening, and welcome to the last Scaramouche puzzle
page. As I wrote in my statement of intent two weeks ago I've
realised that my duties as editor won't allow me time to write a
regular puzzle column next year, so this is the finale to my two
years as FELIX puzzles editor.
I always try to make the end of term puzzles a little harder than
usual, but since this is my curtain call, the sworded puzzles on this
page are real bastards — the cream of puzzles I've rejected as far-
too difficult to set before. Each carries a £10 prize for the first
solution opened on July 1, but if the puzzle is unanswered by then,
the prize will be awarded to the first correct answer I receive. I
anticipate handing out one or possibly two prizes on July 1, and
the others could well be unclaimed by Christmas! Unmarked
puzzles are just for fun, as usual.
Thanks are due to everyone who has entered a puzzle, ever, but
especially to Jonathan Mestel (Grey Spider), Anna O'Donovan,
Charles Bailyn, John Conway, Steve Marshall and the ever
generous Pete and Will at Mend-a-Bike for sponsoring us and for
mending my tandem so quickly, so often.
Finally, we still have a vacancy for next year's puzzles editor.
Any volunteers ? Good luck with the puzzles, and may the
rate of change of momentum be with you.

Foul Fare
I felt it w o u l d be unfair t o start next year
prejudiced against t h e college refectory
service without actually eating there, s o
yesterday I took David Rowe, t h e Phoenix
Editor, a n d Peter Rodgers, t h e handbook
Editor, to l u n c h in Mooney's; today Peter is
ill with food poisoning. T h e m e n u read a s
follows, a n d w e e a c h h a d o n e dish from
e a c h section:
M i n c e d Beef Roll : 60p
S a u s a g e T o a d : 75p
Kidney T u r b e g o : 90p
B a k e d Beans : 15p
Cauliflower : 30p
Green B e a n s : 4 5 p
Pilau R i c e : 3 0 p
M a s h e d Potato : 45p
Boiled Potato : 60p
Peter is t o o ill t o tell us what h e ate, but
David remembers that at the checkout he
paid £1-35, Peter paid £1-20, a n d I paid
£1-50. T h i s information, together with t h e
knowledge of what w e two ate (including, I
m a y s a y , t h e l e a s t a p p e t i s i n g b o i l e d
potatoes I have ever seen) enabled us t o
unmask with complete certainty t h e dish
w h i c h laid Peter out. W h i c h o n e ?

^Holding the Baby
I'm sure many of you remember with great affection the
difficulties of removing Barney McCabe's piano from the
back of the music store last term. Well, it happened again.
Whether out of simple carelessness, or whether because it
was assumed no one would ever want to play such a
dreadful instrument, I can't say. Nevertheless, the Baby
Grand is once again wedged right in at the back of the
music store with all kinds of assorted impedimenta
blocking the way to the door.
I'm sure you remember the rules: there's no room to
rotate any of the instruments without risk of damaging
them, and nothing may be removed from the cupboard
except the Baby Grand. Your task is to get the Baby Grand
out of the cupboard. (If you do it the most efficient
way - and you won't - it takes exactly a hundred moves.
Any solution, though, is admissible for a prize).

^Banana's Revenge
It's been quite a while since Wodge played
chess against his Banana microcomputer.
It's rather an old model, and although it
always plays legally, there is a certain
bizarre streak in its tactical planning.
Anyway, last week Wodge was rum-
maging through some junk in his study
when hefound the machine at the bottom
of a cupboard and in a mixture of pity and
nostalgia he played a few games on it,
beating it easily every time.
Then he tried an interestingexperiment:
he set the machine playing itself, with
remarkable results. The opening move
was conventional enough-white ad-
vanced the king's pawn two squares. But
from then on the game was wildly
unpredictable and came to a dramatic
finish when Black, on its fifth move,
captured a White rook with one of its
knights, thus giving checkmate.
Can you reconstruct the whole game?
tLetters & Figures
Dear Amble
I've just had a letter from Crumble and
D r u d g e . They've been a d d / n g up how
many of this c h a p Scaramouche's puzz/es
they've s o / f e d over the years, and they tell
me that the sum of the numbers each has
done comes to the numberyou have done.
They also menf/on that the product" of
fhe/r fd/7fe/"enij numbers c o m e s to the
n u m b e r / have so/Ved. Even /otoiv/dg that
both have m a n a g e d af least one but less
than twelve I can't deduce how many
you've done. Any c h a n c e of a hint?
