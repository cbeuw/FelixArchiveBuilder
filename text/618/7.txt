However the draft proposals proved
unacceptable to IC's Board of Studies so
the merger was called off.
Just before Christmas the Imperial
College University Challenge team travelled
to Manchester where they beat New Hall,
Cambridge. They followed this with a
comfortable victory over Aberdeen and just
defeated Reading before falling to St.
Andrews in the quarterfinals. The team's
success was one of the most unexpected
and pleasing aspects of the past year.
Television
In addition to appearing on Blue Peter
and University Challenge, the Union also
made an O p e n D o o r programme for
B B C 2 . The programme highlighted the
difficulties encountered by overseas
students when forced to pay full economic
fees.
Several well-known television person-
alities appeared at college this year,
including Prof. H e i n z Wolffe and J i m
Francis (who created the special effects
for T h e H i t c h h i k e r ' s G u i d e T o T h e
G a l a x y ) , both of whom spoke to the
newly reformed H G Wells Society. S T O I C
interviewed a number of film celebrities,
including Timothy Hutton, star of Taps
and Ordinary People, and Jean-Jacques
Annaud, director of Quest For Fire.
Several leading politicians spoke at
College this year. Most were from the
Conservative Party including William
Whitelaw, Norman Tebbit and Sir Keith
Joseph. Dr David Owen (SDP) and Neil
Kinnock (Labour) also spoke.
All of these speakers stressed that
universities cannot depend entirely on the
government for their finance and suggested
closer collaboration with industry.
College had already realised this in
March when they set up Imperial Bio-
technology Ltd. The company was set up
to exploit the commercial potential of the
biotechnology pilot plant in the Biochem-
istry department.
Shut that door!
Residence
Although the penthouse flats in Southside-
were finally let out to students in January a
number of other C o l l e g e - o w n e d f l a t s ,
notably the refectory flat i n the U n i o n
Building which had been vacant for years,
remained unoccupied. Hall rents were also
increased by Â£1.50 in January, an increase
agreed with "in principle" in November by
Nick Morton, despite the Union's policy
against mid-session rent increases.
In March a system of electronic bolts
were installed in the Southside Basement
but were vandalised within an hour. This
caused an understandable outburst by Nick
Morton at the U G M the following day.
There were also proposals to house two
students in single rooms in W e e k s Hall but
these have been shevled for this year.
Decisions
Although six of the nine U n i o n General
Meetings were quorate this year, very little
HG Wells Society's Pallab Ghosh demonst-
rating the immortal Wide-Mouthed Frog joke
at the Society's annual dinner.
The HG Wells Society was reformed at
the start of this session and became one of
the largest societies at college, attracting
more than 500 members.

passed in the first term and these included
m o t i o n s o n g o v e r n m e n t c u t s , I r a n i a n
students and Princess A n n e , as well as the
Rag M a g motions. A motion proposing a
referendum on re-affiliation to the National
Union of Students was defeated.
The Results U G M in M a r c h was the most
confusing, and at times farcical, meeting of
the year. T h e vociferous meeting refused to
ratify Steve Goulder's election as President
a n d v o t e d to r e - r u n all four s a b b a t i c a l

Returning Officer M a r c o Ledwold decided
that the grounds of the objections were
i n v a l i d u n d e r the c o n s t i t u t i o n a n d he
r e f u s e d t o r e - r u n t h e e l e c t i o n . A n
Emergency General Meeting two weeks
later ratified all the elections.
The other successful candidates were
Phil Greenstreet (Deputy President), Mary
Freeman ( H o n Sec) and Martin S. Taylor
( F E L I X Editor).

F E L I X
A s ever, F E L I X provided a focal point for
the d i s c u s s i o n of r e l e v a n t i s s u e s . O l d
campaigners like D r Frank James have
found new enemies to fight it out with on the
letters page. The Soapbox articles have also
been fairly lively and have provided a means
for e x p r e s s i n g an o p i n i o n o n t o p i c s as
varied as South Africa and the state of R C S
U n i o n .
F E L I X has maintained a critical role,
focussing attention on both the College and
the Union. There have been few things
which have slipped by without comment
and yet the College still seems to carry on
m a k i n g s l i p - u p s w h i c h a r e p o t e n t i a l l y
embarrassing.
The reluctance of Union President N i c k
M o r t o n to be totally open with information
' has led to some friction between himself and
F E L I X Editor M a r k Smith. However, M r
M o r t o n h a s o f t e n r e s p o n d e d w e l l to
criticism with some fine letters on one or
two occasions.
M a r k S m i t h ' s d e c i s i o n to allow free
c o m m e n t d u r i n g the sabbatical election
campaign was undoubtedly a major change
of direction for F E L I X , and it is ironic that it
was a simple error in interpretation of the
v o t i n g p r o c e d u r e w h i c h l e a d to s u c h
confusion at the time. None of the election
Soapbox articles resulted in a challenge to
the conduct of the elections.
1981-82 started with a series of
mistakes which are catalogued at the
start of this review. As 1982-3 app-
roaches the stakes are even higher.
Decisions will not be made about the
Union Lower Lounge but the entire
Union building. The new and future
executives must ensure these mist-
akes are not repeated.
