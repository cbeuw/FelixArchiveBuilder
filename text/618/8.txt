Hi everybody, I'm back again with a few
juicy items for you all. There's been a bit
of a vacuum on the scandals and exposes
front this term, as I've been busy looking
for Lord Lucan again in the tunnels under
IC. But never fear, B.B. is back!
I'm told that revolting J C R bartender Alan
Larson is a native of North America. Last
term this glutinous mountain of a man was
taking part in one of his customary alcoholic
binges and was soon completely unable to stay
upright. A few friends, who had been playing
"spot the amorphous mass", offered him a
h a n d a n d r e t u r n e d h i m to the S h e r f i e l d
Building. The jolly barman claimed that he'd
left all his money in his jacket, which was still in
the J C R Bar.
W h e n he'd eventually woken the security
guard he was refused entrance because he was
far too drunk. In desperation he rolled over to
the Union Bar and borrowed £5 from Bar
Manager Jimmy Carrol for a taxi.
Later i n , the week when equally rotund
Catering Manager Victor Mooney heard about
J i m m y ' s g e n e r o s i t y , he c o m m e n t e d " Y o u
should have given him £127—so he could buy
a single ticket back to N e w Y o r k ! "

Talking about our bumbling catering manager,
Victor is known as a bit of a slave driver. In fact
•
1 can reveal that he even keeps a camel driver's
whip in his desk, the handle of which screws
out to reveal a dagger.
Jovial Victor got married again at Christmas
and he's now living happily somewhere in
London. M y spies tell me that if you're up at
the right time you can even see him lumbering
into College on his newly acquired bicycle.
What a sight that must be!
But hang on! Doesn't Victor have a luxury
flat in Princes Gardens, supplied free of charge
by the College? The same flat which was
decorated at great expense a few years ago?
Indeed he does. A few years back, witnesses
i n t h e R C S U O f f i c e e v e n s a w V i c t o r
clambering through the front window in the
early hours, when his previous spouse locked
him out after alcoholic outings of his o w n .
So if Victor's new home is within easy
cycling distance, does he really still need a
College flat?
W h e n I next hear the traffic report o n the
radio say there's an obstruction in Exhibition
Road, I'll rush over and bend his ear!
I must admit the announcement of Captain
L i n d l e y ' s r e t i r e m e n t b r o u g h t a t e a r (of
laughter) to my eye, and there has to be one
more story for old times sake.
Petty Officer Lindley seems to have-been
having a bit of trouble with the sign on his
office door. About a year ago his original,
b e a r i n g n a m e r a n k a n d r o o m n u m b e r ,
disappeared. T o replace it a typed piece of
c a r d was e r e c t e d (using s t a n d a r d c o l o u r
drawing pins of course), but this too went
absent without leave. O f c o u r s e I k n o w
nothing about the w h e r e a b o u t s of these
wandering items, but it did make me laugh to
hear that a sign saying "Private" has now
appeared o n his door.
I bet the old salt didn't expect to be demoted
and transferred before being put out to grass!

IC C h o i r h a n g e r - o n a n d retiring D e a n of
Guilds "Professor" Eric Brown seems to have
a healthy eye for business.
According to sources in the Civil Engineer-
ing department, the good professor "recom-
m e n d s " students o n his c o u r s e to b u y a
wonderful little textbook written "by—guess
• who?—Eric Brown. N o t that this is so unusual,
but my moles also reveal that the book is long
out of print and that he has the only stock from
which his wretched students can get their copy
in his office.
T o really c l e a n up o u r s n o b b i s h little
salesman also pressurises people into not
taking notes during his lectures, which means
they have to buy his book. If they do take
notes he apparently stops lecturing to take the
piss!
Well done Eric, that's setting a fine example
for British businessmen! If only they were all
like you the country would be back on its feet
in no time.
Incoming Rector's doormat Steve Goulder has
had one or two strange adventures. None
more so than his transvestite wanderings
following the Rag and Drag Disco in 1980.
O u r hirsute sabbatical-to-be had been doing
his best to i m p e r s o n a t e the t h e n D e p u t y
President Rae Snee by shoving two enormous
balloons up the front of a slinky red dress. H e
foolishly left his clothes in the R C S U Office
and had to sleep in the F E L I X Office without
recovering them, after he lost his partner Miss
Caroline Godin.
In the morning Caroline unwisely took all his
clothes to the Falmouth Hall room of F E L I X
Editor Steve Marshall. When M r Goulder
phoned to ask him to bring them over, M r
Marshall wickedly said "It's starting to rain and
I don't fancy going out—why don't you come
over here for tea?" and promptly put the
phone down.
R a t h e r than argue o u r P r e s i d e n t - e l e c t
strode over to Falmouth and was quite a sight
coming across Princes Gardens resplendent
with beard, red umbrella and a beautifully
matching dress!
Whilst the Editor is selective about photo-
graphs for F E L I X , I have found the following in
the Photosoc bins. If anyone would like to
claim them.
