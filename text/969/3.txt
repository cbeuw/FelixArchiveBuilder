Editorial
Have you finished your exams?
Bored on Monday and Tuesday?
Why not try voting in the election
for Deputy President (Clubs and
Societies)? Voting takes place
between 10am and 5pm next week
and all you need is a Union card to
take part.
It is a fun game and this is how
you play: Find you favourite
candidate and put a number 1 in the
box next to his/her name, then find
your next preferred choice put a
number 2 by their name, continue
until either you can count no further
or you run out of candidates.
It is hardly very difficult and
Falling facts
Dear Editor,
I would like to clarify some of the
statements made in the article 'Pick-
axe' in Felix issue 968 relating to
the Department of Materials.
The phrase 'tumbling student
numbers' does not apply to the
Department of Materials. In recent
years we have maintained an
undergraduate intake of about 40
students and, as we have had a 20%
increase in applications this year, it
is likely that the October 1993 entry
will be somewhat higher. The
situation is similar at postgraduate
level where the figures show that
for the size of the Department we
have a large number of students
studying for a PhD; over the last
five years the total FTE (a measure
people have died for the right to
vote so give it a go. There will be
ballot boxes in every department.
You have no excuse not to.
Oh Y e a , O h Y e a , a few
announcements:
Firstly the very last bumper,
sexy, venting of spleen Felix will
be produced on the Wednesday
23rd June. This has repercussions,
which will mean that on Friday 18th
June if you go looking for a Felix
you will not find one. We do not
produce a Felix one the second to
last Friday of term because it takes
so long to produce the final issue.
If anybody decides to come in and
ask 'where is Felix?' on that day,
the next sound they hear will be the
cracking of their own knee caps.
of the number of students in a
department used to calculate
funding) PhD population has varied
from 57 to 79 with the current
figure being 79.
From time to time all departments
have to look critically at their
academic missions and structures.
The Department of Materials is
currently engaged in such an
exercise but I would like to
emphasise that the intention is to
retain a strong Materials
undergraduate course with
increased student numbers and an
active research school with an
international reputation.
Yours sincerely,
Malcolm McLean.

features and extended articles
section, one reviews section and
one News and current affairs

Anything received after that date
cannot be guaranteed to be printed.
Secondly, If your needs extend to

bound edition is every issue of this
year's Felix, surrounded

Dear Jonty,
The next few months will see a
dramatic improvement inthe
screening facilities at FilmSoc, with
the opening of the Imperial College
Union Cinema, in the Union
Concert Hall. The moving of
FilmSoc to the Concert Hall has
already been an improvement on
Mech Eng 220. Over the Summer
months a 35mm projection system
will be installed in a projection
room to be built at the rear of the
Concert Hall. This type of
projection system is the cinema
industry standard, which will allow
FilmSoc to screen commercial
release prints distributed to
cinemas. At present three
screenings a week are envisaged,
but this may increase with demand.
However I feel three screenings
a week would involve far too great

but the more people who participate
the less the cost. A l l who are
interested in either announcements
ask to speak to Jonty in the Felix
Office or ring 3515 and ask for
same.

looking for Managers, Duty
Managers, Cashiers, Ushers and

Celebration
The party on Thursday 28th May
was short lived - for as soon as
Kenneth Clarke (MP) was
announced as the next chancellor,
down came the balloons and the
music was turned off. Every
ministry that he has passed through
has suffered severely; health,
education etc etc. Just when I
thought that may be the country
might get a chancellor who knew
what to do with the economy to
improve it, John Major (PM, cretin)
appoints Kenneth Clarke (disaster
zone). Oh dear.
Always look on the bright side,
as they say. Norman Lamont (MP,
ex C of E, tee hee) has gone (at last)
which will bring a new face to the
Exchequer and a wave of new jokes
from the comedians and the press.
What will they make of Kenneth
Clarke (new C of E) and Michael
Portillo (smarmy git) who now run
the Exchequer together? (Gulp)
F u c k
What is wrong with the word
'fuck'? O K so there are a few
circumstances when this strong
word should not be used as a way
of self expression. But the word
itself is far from a bad word. Fuck
is a good word. If your parents did
not fiick then you wouldn't be here
today. You cannot dismiss a word
that describes (a) the propagation of
the human race, and (b) strong
disgust towards something or
someone, simply because you have
difficulty coping with its strength.
That's your problem, and I suggest
you get over it. The word 'fuck' is
becoming more commonly used and
will not go away.

A different point of view? A
different angle to hold your head at
more like. Does this woman have
a physical disability that means she
cannot look directly at a camera?
She always seems to leer at
everyone, even her boss for all I
know. Imagine having trying to
have a normal conversation with
someone who's head never points
in your direction. She should
channel her inadequate writing
attempts into a book, suitable called
'Making Everyone Feel Inferior To
You The Easy Way'.
T h e Royals
Don't write in claiming that I am
a hypocrite for what I am about to
say. We should scrap the Royal
Family. I know that ? weeks ago I
said we should keep them.
But the current surge of special
reports, full page opinions, late
night discussions and all the rest of
the media space fillers have caused
me to change my mind. I am sick
to death of the lot of them. If the
Royal Family is scrapped now, all
the TV specials and newspaper pull-
outs (or throwaways) will be over
within a couple of weeks.
And never again will this sorry
household be mentioned. Amen.

'System Failure' flashed the message on the computer screen.
P.J. Dodd calmly swallowed another mouthful of Pepsi (the
choice of a new generation), tossed the empty can towards the
bin, got up from the swivel back chair, took a small step back,
and kicked the shit out of the PC that had just crashed. 'One
day' he thought, 7 will strangle the designer of these machines.
One day.' He booted up another machine, and continued to type.
That was an excerpt from 'Hassles From A Computer', the new
book available from Felix publishers, price £4.99.
