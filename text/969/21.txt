Breathe in, out, in, out, up the

in front of me. Jam today. 'I'm in

Society, William Foster (Michael

a pie in the sky, his future is past

'Opera composers shouldn't be
allowed to write masses, unless
they're Mozart. Discuss.' Another
counterexample, less obvious than
Rossini and Verdi, might be
Puccini. His liturgical offering,
unlike that of his two compatriots,
dates from the very beginning of his
career. The Messa di Gloria, a
graduation piece, makes no attempt
to hide its operatic pretensions, and
indeed is none the worse for them.
Last Friday the IC Choir under
Eric Brown did not have the
strength of numbers (due perhaps to
exam term) always to ride over an
enthusiastic brass seciton, but
passages such as the obligatory
fugue were lithe and well-focused.

defence industry so successful, that
there's no longer any need for
defence. The Cold War's past, and
he's past his use-by date. Trapped
in traffic, driving to work which he
no longer has, he flips, leaving a
cumulative trail of violence across
the city.
Meanwhile, Martin Prendergast
(Robert Duvall) L A P D , is about to
retire, but he's the only one who
notices the connection; two
ordinary men, each doggedly
pursuing a personal goal. To see his
daughter for her birthday. To make
one last arrest.

Lust, greed, infatuation make the
human heart behave in the strangest
of ways, making 'even' murder and
adultery 'completely justifiable'.
In the Changeling, Alsemero and
Beatrice-Joanna fall in 'lust' at first
sight, however, Beatrice-Joanna's
father has arranged for her to marry
Alonzo. In desperation, Beatrice-
Joanna convinces De Flores the
family servant, who is smithen with
her, to murder Alonzo; but in return
he demands a place in her bed.
Although repulsed by De Flores,
Beatrice-Joanna is forced to
continue an affair with him after her
marriage to Alsemero.
Meanwhile two of Beatrice-
Joanna's father's servants disguised
as lunatics gain entry to Dr Alibius'
'Operator—the top of my head is gone—help.

his beautiful wife. The possessive
Dr Alibius keeps his wife locked up
while he is away, she is guarded by
his assistant, Lollio, excellently
played by Geoffrey Freshwater.
The two servants become suspects
to Alonzo's murder.
The Changling is a cruel and
sadistic tale of greed, lust and
seduction. After a disappointing
first act, the play gained power in
the second half, however I felt a
much stronger performance was
needed to do this play full justice
and as a result was a little
disappointed.

in the beautiful Gratias agimus tibi,
which received a fine and
wholehearted performance from
tenor Octavio dos Santos Nato.
The main item in the first half
was Stravinksy's Symphony of
Psalms, a sutnning piece of music,
scored for a large orchestra by two
pianos but without upper strings.
Again a larger body of singers
would have helped to bring more
intensity to an accurate
performance. The orchestra
sounded as if they might have
benefitted from a little more
rehearsal, although there was some
excellent flute and oboe playing at
the start of the slow-burn central
movement.

Mela is a seventy year old
flamboyant and eccentric
grandmother who has the
philosophy that her bags are packed
for the final journey and she waiting
for the announcer to call 'all
aboard'. Does she intend to spend
her days moping around waiting for
death? You must be joking! She is
out there, experiencing discos,
drugs, sex, young men, the lot.
Only two problems: Rosaria,
Mela's daughter and Carmen,
Mela's granddaughter, who both
think that Mela should be locked up
in a funny farm. Rosaria is an
idealistic revolutionary, who
frankly got on my nerves, and on
Carmen's nerves for that matter,
with her apologetic nature and
views on how the world should be.
Carmen on the other hand is a
confident, self-centred cow who
lands herself in a spot of bother.
All three women live under the
same roof and so a few slagging
matches go on which produce a
lorra laughs, especially from Mela.
The play gives you an insight in to
what these women are thinking and
feeling very well, but it ends
prematurely. It is left so wide open
that God only knows what happens.
This, I feel, lets the play down a bit
and such a masterpiece deserves
some sort of conclusion. But it is
worth a visit.
(P.S. Did I mention how bloody
good the actresses are?)
