started to pull. The condoms both
stretched to about a meter before
one suddenly snapped. Luckily for
the owners of K Y Jelly, it wasn't
theirs. Of more relevance was the
fact that the snapping condom had
sprayed oil based lubricant all over
the place. The tables, chairs and
spectators of this strange condom
stretching event were now proud
owners of freshly deposited
'lubricant'.
After clearing up a little, the
assembled observers decided that
this was not very good test. As all
the parts had been supplied by K Y
Jelly and cutting the condom in hallf
might have effected the results of
the test. Such are the trails of
playing a game with any scientist,
they take it all so seriously. It was
decided that we should get some
more condoms and repeat the event.
So off I went to search Imperial
College Union Building for more
fodder for our latex protection tests.
Strangely, all the mens toilets were
completely devoid of condoms. One
empty machine lay outside the
conveniences looking like it been
ripped off the wall. I was depressed,
if I was about to have sex, I would
be near hysteria by now. There was
one last hope, a female friend
offered to go into the Ladies toilets
and buy a packet of three from
there. Strange place Imperial, you
can't buy condoms if you're a man,
but you can if you're a woman.
When she returned, she cast a
knowing wink in my direction. I
started to explain, then realised that
if I were her, I wouldn't believe me
either.
Returning to examine the contents
of the packet, our panel of judges
discovered one Strawberry and two
'Cock'tail flavour Mates condoms.
We decided that strawberry was far
too queer so it would have to be the
manly 'Cock'tail that was put under
the strain. Again these were tested
rigorously for the fragrance: We
came to the considered conclusion
it was the aroma of Juicy Fruits with
a touch of rubber that would
fragrance our simulated love
making test.
After another session of
smothering condoms with grease,
we sat for one hundred and twenty
seconds dripping with the various
oils that had been scattered about.
The table began to look like it had
been the lardy bathing place for
some Northerner. Stretching the
condoms was considered a poor
The KYJelly testerpack: A condom,
some Jelly, some instructions and
a dodgy looking bottle
guide, so we tried to insert a hand
as far in to the sheath as possible.
I took the oil soaked one, Donny the
K Y covered version, and almost as
soon as my hand slid in, the condom
split. Donny managed to put his
entire fist and half his arm in to the
rubber casing before it gave way.
It may have been the 'Cock'tail
flavour, but it unnerved me that the
oil based one broke so easily.
Every one around the table had
used condoms, but none admitted
ever using a lubricant. A bit of a
waste, as no one directly concerned
by the rotting condoms was able to
comment on the test. One Student
Union President did say ' K Y Jelly
is the one I use every time'. But,
for all you people who decide to
play around with the Baby Oil, its
better to use a water based lubricant
just in case some gets on your
chosen method of protection.
So back to Maxine, who
incidentally is one of the people
employed to promote K Y Jelly at
Red Rooster PR:
'... Yeah, the KY one didn't break'
"That's good, are you going to be
able to do an article about it?'
'Shouldn't be a problem...'
