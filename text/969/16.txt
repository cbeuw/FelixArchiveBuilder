Sexy little dance number shaking its
wobbly bits at all the right
moments; nice saxophone-based
savagery packing its pistols over a
powerful meaty bass. Semi-
detached, with garage, too. Won't
put the shits up the clergy, but kids,
take care: it's summer, and
anything can happen.

First and foremost, I'm not sure in
what capacity, if any, that this will
be released in. It features bands on
the Food label, EMI's token
subsidiary for the kids. Food have
Blur. Food have Jesus Jones.

Strangelove open this, with a
track called 'Hysteria Unknown';
it's the Cult! I yelled delightedly,
doing a straight-faced 'What
difference does it make?'. Like 77ie
Smiths propounding a serious rock
ethic. The band themselves are
tipped for great things, along with
B l a g g e r s I T A - Stress
It's hard not to feel a certain
fondness for such blatant agit-rock;
'Stress' is reminiscent of both the
Redskins and the Screaming Blue
Messiahs, a great, antagonistic rock
n' rap effort to kick against the
pricks with some wickedly parping
horns thrown in. 'The way to die'
is similarly unsubtle, but more
obviously dance fare than 'Stress'.
Maybe they just caught me in a
good mood, but this is bags of fun,
and perhaps a pointed comment that
the squatter's party and the Pogo are
just around the corner as the bubble
finally bursts for pop culture.
Maybe punk was just something
that happened to other people, but
every new generation gets the
terrorists it deserves.

the band who follow them, Mint

here, and is an assault akin to the
Ministry, minus their more
Einsturzende jackhammery
moments, doing a nursery rhyme
singalong. Pay attention, kids, for
here is the word; the word is
'good'. Whirlpool are up next, with
'King's Cross', a passable slice of
bruised funk rock that has its
moments. The last two songs, by
the Mouth and Skyscraper
respectively, are quite pleasing in
themselves, leaving us the feeling
that Food are rather pleased with
their little showcase. It is a

If I told you this was a great song,
I'd be lying; it certainly isn't the
first time a song has dropped
through my skylight with a nice idea
and a soupcon of blunt wit, only to
be let down by half-arsed, full-
powered pop of the 'normal
standard' standard. Just ask me
what I think of Carter.
'Shockaholic' is another
commentary on the nature of things
with a capital 'SHIT', and would
seem to be, in its own small way,
specifically directed at society's
(That's 'society' with a capital
'SHIT', readers - sic. Ed) thrill-
seeking populace. Unfortunately,
no self-respecting shockfreak is
going to look in this direction.
Now, if the music itself were
thrilling, we'd have irony, and be
forced to acknowledge Kinky
Machine as 'Kings of Pop' in a very
straight-faced way. Ironic, that.

undoubtably, but I can't think of

T h e r a p y ? - F a c e the Strange
E.P.
More knuckleduster rock from
those noisy noise boys following up
on the inspired 'Shortsharpshock'
E.P. with a substantial quantity of
exquisitely hideous guitar work for
ears gone lazy. 'Neckfreak' is, I'm
told, the only track on this four
track E.P. to appear on the album
'Nurse', and is uncomfortably close
to those dead men from Dublin, U2.
The line is becoming ever more
vague, and difficult to distinguish...
It's a question of attitude, I
suppose; It took U2 ten years to
learn how to exploit their own
bullshit, and I don't for a minute
imagine that Therapy? will pursue
that line. Not, I hasten to add, on
the strength of the other three tracks
anyway, and I mean 'Strength'.

UIMICD2 - Various
Again like the 5 for '93 product
reviewed over there (I'm sorry we
can't oblige you with an arrow to
point in the necessary direction),
this would seem to be another
showcase for some Phonogram
bands whose names sound vaguely
familiar. I don't recall hearing
anything by any of them before, so
I shall just have to launch bravely
on, sans reference points.
The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
open with 'Someday I suppose', a
cute track that starts off with a ska
feel before becoming guitar pop in
no uncertain terms. Tracks 2 and 3
are by Kerb Dog and Mindbomb
respectively, and tend towards
noisy metal territory. Darlingheart
follow with a very Muses effort
'Smarthead'; I kid you not when I
say this would be at home on
'Hunkpapa', and there may be a
plethora of bands sounding like
Throwing Muses at the moment, but
'Smarthead' is a well-crafted song,
and maybe a triumph of substance
over style awaits them. The 5th
track is called 'Waiting for the Sun'
by the Jayhawks, and as I can think
of nothing constructive to say, I
shall say nothing. Track 6 is the
standout, by Urban Species. A
smooth, jazzy swingbeaty/hip
hoppy number, 'The Ropes (Trick
of the Trade)'is very cool indeed.
Don't know where you'll be able to
buy it, don't care either; I've
already got mine.
