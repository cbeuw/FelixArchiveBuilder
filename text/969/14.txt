Unforgiven Showing on 10th June
This week's masterpiece at
FilmSoc is Unforgiven, winner of
three Oscars (four if you include the
technical ones), and a Bafta. This
year's Best Picture, it also won Best
Director for Clint Eastwood, and
Gene Hackman took Best
Supporting Actor for his
performance as the brutal sheriff in
this Western must-see. Eastwood
plays William Munny, a reformed
killer, asked to do a little vigilante
work and punish two cowboys for
hurting a local prostitute. Modern
westerns rarely come along these
days, and never as good as this one.
Even if you're not a fan of cowboy
movies, this one is excellent
beacuse of its acting but particularly
beautiful scenery and final
cinematography. Whether you're a
fan of Eastwood or not you should
find this film very enjoyable.
Unforgiven screens at 7.30pm, next
Thursday, in the Union Concert
Hall, and don't forget Da Vinci's
Happy Hour immediately before it
to make the evening even better.
That's it for FilmSoc this
year...and what a year it's been.
Thanks for coming along, and if
you're here next year, make sure
you're among the first to see one of
our 35mm shows with our new
projection equipment. And a quick

upstart) Laugharne, Pete (1-2-3)

Mene, Costas Galenos (super-proj),
