Greasing the tool
Canyour rubber take the strain? Jonty Beavan triesout the KYJelly test
on the best friend of man's best friend.
'Well how was it then?'
'Sorry?'
'The stress tests on the condoms?'
'Ahh...'
Maxine was inquiring after the
small blue tissue box that she had
sent me a few weeks ago.
Discreetly wrapped inside several
man sized tissues were two
masculine sized condoms, a
mystery plastic bottle, a tube of K Y
jelly and two rubber gloves.
This was not a press release from
Perverts-R-Us, but a 'try it at home'
test for all those of you who were
worried which lubricant to use
when you are performing the act of
love. If you use a condom and an
oil based lubricant you could be in
trouble. It has been shown that the
oil based lubricants eat away at the
rubber of the condom making it
much more likely to break during
the strains of lovemaking. Tiny
perforations develop, invisible to
the eye, and reduce the condom's
ITALY.
strength by up to 90%. Well, that's
what it said in the information pack,
and who I am to question?
But why bother with it anyway?
The main users are male
homosexuals, as the act of anal sex
is a little short on lubrication.
Frequently it is used in 'moments
when a little extra help is needed'
during heterosexual intercourse
(Quotes taken from any advert for
the ever famous K Y Jelly). What
has worried many Doctors is that
when the wheels of love need to
greased, the first thing most people
reach for is Baby Oil. In these days
fear about AIDS a condom that is
likely to burst is a very dangerous
thing and common Baby Oil is one
of those risky substances. Hence
K Y Jelly have jumped upon the
band wagon as the only big name
water based lubricant. They have
employed a PR company to prove
how wonderful their tubes of oil are
compared to nasty condom-rotting
Johnson's Baby Lotion.
Actually doing the test in the kit
proved to be a little more difficult
than would be first imagined.
Firstly, the two condoms supplied
with the kit were no longer there,
someone had run of with one of
them. In the interests of scientific
investigation, the three people who
had gathered to do the test, decided
to cut the one we had in half. Jonty,
Donny O'Nonchalant and Steff
huddled around a rather too
conspicuous table to test to
destruction a mint scented Mates
condom. Incidentally this particular
condom definitely smelt of mint but
did not taste of it, I should know,
I was stupid enough to try it on my
tongue.
In a scene reminiscent of The
Rocky Horror Picture Show, my
two assistants placed the rubber
gloves on to my hands so that I
could begin the operation. Liberal
amounts from the mysterious botde,
which we presumed to be the
notorious 'oil based lubricant', were
then poured of the innocent half
condom. We then realised that our
single pair of gloves were covered
in the oil so could not be used to
grease up the other condom without
prejudicing the experiment. Donny
quickly leapt in the the fray and
volunteered to smear his hands and
the rest of the prophylactic with K Y
Jelly. Mere seconds later the two
halves were sitting on opposite ends
of the table looking like gutted fish
swimming in our chosen lubricant.
After being left to soak in their
own juices for a total of two
minutes, the moment of truth
arrived. Donny took one end of
each condom, I took the other and
