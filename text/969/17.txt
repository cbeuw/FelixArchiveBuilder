Iris D e m e n t — I n f a m o u s
A n g e l
It's not often that an album can
honestly be described as 'purely
anything' but 'Infamous Angel' is
just pure, full stop. Partly it's Iris
voice, which most country singers
would D.I.V.O.R.C.E. for but the
sympathetic production of Jim
Rooney also plays its part. (He of
Nanci Griffith fame). Which is not
to necessarily say that 'Infamous
Angel' is good, as there are some

Sometimes, you hope for a record;
sometimes you give up hoping.
Sometimes, a record comes at you
from out of nowhere. Sometimes,
eternity hides itself in the most
innocuous places; I'm really pleased
to be able to tell you that
'Kamakiriad' is all of those. And
then some.
Potted history: 1972. Donald
Fagen and Walter Becker form the
creative impetus behind Steely
Dan's debut album, 'Can't buy a
thrill'. It is universally acclaimed.
Steely Dan produce another six
brilliant albums, including
'Countdown to Ecstasy' and 'Aja'
before imploding. In 1982, Donald
Fagen releases his first solo album,
'The Nightfly', to unanimous
applause. And then...
Eleven years later, Donald Fagen
returns, with Walter Becker as
producer, for his second solo
album, 'Kamakiriad'. To describe
it as 'Long-Awaited' is an
understatement in extremis; music
journalists the world over, including
myself down here in Lowest-of-
Lowsville, have been behaving like

The black cowboy has always been
an enigma.
Take Blazing Saddles: it's
satirical outlook, trivialising the
existence of the black man, let alone
a black sheriff, and as a statement
only inducing cheap laughs at the
expense of a much deeper and more
important issue. The Oscar winning
The Unforgiven never really raised
it.
The new Posse is a yet to be
released black cowboy film directed
by Mario Van Peebles and stars
shooters like Big Daddy Kane, Billy
Zane and Blair T saw you on the
Word' Underwood. It is probably
an attempt to highlight
awareness—as one in three
cowboys were black—and must
make a change to the usually white-
washed western. This is the yet to
be released soundtrack.
On a cursory glance through (a
cloying tastes about it, particularly
when she starts to involve her
family. Both parents get dedicated
songs, and with respect I hope her
Pa is gone the way of all flesh
because she's singing about burying
him already. The cause of nepotism
is taken to further heights on the
gospel classic 'Higher Ground'. Oh
yes, Flora Mae DeMent (my dear
mother) gets to do lead vocals in
that shaky way reminiscent of heavy
old ladies of bus-pass vintage. Not
pregnant felines going into labour
for the past few weeks. Meeow.
The music is heavenly, the
smokiest, sleekest, sexiest, silkiest
faux-luxe jazz-fusion imaginable,
plucked out of the sky and set to
eight tracks about a boy and his car.
The first song, "Trans-Island
Skyway' is about the narrator
'about to embark on a journey in his
new dream-car, a custom-tooled
Kamakiri. It's built for the new
century: steam-driven, with a self-
contained vegetable garden and a
radio link with the tripstar routing
satellite'.
The fantastic of the next millennia
beautifully set as if it were the
reality of now sublimates every
track of this futuristic road movie.
From the 'Shack on Cape Sincere'
to the Metroplex in visors and
thermasuits; from Sheilus, and the
reefs of Kizmar, to Stargate, and the
Outer Worlds, Donald Fagen is
telling the story in the buzzwords
of the day. Buzzwords solely
because he has initiated them as
such. Yes, I may be critically
biased, no, I don't care what you
think, yes, I do advise you to hear
this. I advise you to mortgage your

Melvin Van Peebles appears to be
on the listing, no, not a Dutch
cousin of Andy, but a relation of
Mario. With blatant nepotism in the
likes of Beverly Hills 90210,
Hollywood has a lot to answer for
itself—preferential treatment to
relatives is elitist, but in a way
everybody can be forgiven, as
through the transcendental words of
the Dalai Lama, we are all brothers
and sisters. Personal thoughts aside,
the potent statement on it: 'Freedom
isn't something you make, freedom
is something to take' leaves you
wondering.
Intelligent Hoodlum's "The Posse
(Shoot 'Em Up)', is an assertion
that appearances can be deceiving
and is one of the best tracks with
its Spaghetti sampling, rich name
drops, insane catchiness, T V
cowboy pots, and the smoking
statement of '...if you live by the
gun, you die by the gun', seems to
sum up the whole western ethos,

a pretty sound. In her defence I
should say that Iris has a boyfriend
called Elmer too. It could only
happen in the land of the free.
Thankfully this family album is
limited to fair songs only and the
remaining seven have enough
quality to overreach and send you
away with a tear in your eye. The
simple accompaniment of fiddle,
dobro, piano, bass and acoustic
guitar set the scene for Iris to weave
her small town stories of love,
irrespective of colour.
The gospel workouts of The
Sounds of Blackness are a positive
improvement to their Mo' Money
contribution, the harmonisation
brilliant and adds to the varied
influences here.
Whatever happened to the jazz
track though? Not commercial
enough, no doubt.
Vesta's 2nd contribution 'Ride of
Your Life' with its 'Hey you, big
man, come here...', is either
furthering the myth, or making the
lamentable (!) John Holmes turn in
his grave and impale himself. The
song itself is nauseating despite a
soulful voice, and is the epitome of
commercial compromise.
Making it a wrap The Neville
Brothers are stanning, their desolate
atmosphere on 'Let the Hammer
Fall', with slavering chains in the
background must be emancipatory.
The art experimentation 'siezed
upon' by Ennio Morricone lives
partially to the present, but maybe

loyalty, future glory and infamous
angels. 'Let the mystery be' and
'hotter than Mojave in my heart' are
the best of the bunch. Fiddle solos
and lyrics like 'you came along and
you tipped my apple cart' prove that
reports of Nashville's death have
been great exaggerated.

there's too much parmesan and too
little garlic—plenty of surface
appeal but not enough underlying
substance. As Tintin commented on
Wild West, it is rather worrying
about the film soundtrack turning
into just another opportunity to
make money. Media manipulators.
If you do buy this though, in
addition to the already mentioned,
listen out for Tone Loc, Michael
Colombier and Top Choice Clique
(MC Force and Nuno Bettencourt),
while make an effort to ignore
Vesta, (B)BOTI and Salli
