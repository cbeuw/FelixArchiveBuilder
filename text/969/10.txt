It's a bit difficult writing an
article on a subject which arouses
as many feelings as prostitution.
Some people want titilation; some
think the whole notion is disgusting
and degrading; some may get a kick
out of such an article. So being a
firm believer that every man (at
least) is a pervert no matter how
latent, who will at least be curious
about the subject I thumb my nose
at what is expected of me in writing
such an article, throw political
correctness out of the window and
carry on in my own chosen way.
You can hardly have failed to
notice all the handouts found in
'phone booths in the South
Kensington area advertising all sorts
of carnal gratification. You may
even have tried 'phoning one or two
up for a giggle (or otherwise); but
for all of you who haven't, whether
it's because you can't be arsed or
you're afraid, here is a guide of
what you can expect.
The first woman I called (373
1284) advertised herself as 'TVs
Fantasy Haven, Satin and Lace,
Frocks and Frills, Wigs and High
Heels' so I decided, rather than tell
her I was researching for purely
journalistic interests I would
pretend to be a punter.
- ' H i . I saw an advert of yours in
a phone booth in Chelsea...How
much will it cost me?'
- 'It depends what you want.'
- 'Bondage, say.'
- 'Forty pounds.'
- 'What about humiliation?'
- 'Thats the same thing...'
At this point the call girl was
extremely suspiscious. How was I
to know they were the same thing?
The word 'Physicist' is a synonym

of 'naive'.
- '...Where are you?'
- 'Me? I'm at South Kensington.'
- 'No you're not!'
At which point she hung up,
which was a bit odd because it was
the only truthful thing I had said
during the entire conversation.
According to a denizen of the Felix
office this may have been a ploy to
make sure that the caller is a serious
prospective client rather than a
joker or police officer; a call girl
expects a serious client to call back.
This may have been so but I was
rather disgruntled at being rumbled
and so I moved on to my next call.
My approach to 'Brand new
stunning model' (938 3586) was
more honest.
- 'Hi. My name is Phillip and I'm
a freelance journalist researching
call girls. Is it possible to ask you
a few questions?'
- 'Erm...er.. Hang on...'
I heard her call another woman
over and I asked her the same
question. There was a few giggles
shared by the two and it seemed that
they were far more embarrassed
than I was.
- 'Erm.. sorry, love, we're a bit
busy at the moment...'
And she hung up.
'School girl type' (370 7696) was
far more co-operative and I was
able to chat quite happily with her.
The first thing which struck me was
that, judging by her voice, no way
was she just out of school, unless
she was a teacher; she sounded as
if she was in her forties. I was very
pleased when she agreed to answer
a few journalistic questions such
as..
- 'So, how much do you charge?'
