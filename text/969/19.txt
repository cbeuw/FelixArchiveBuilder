C a n ' t P a y W o n ' t Pay
Dario Fo's unique blend of farce
and acute political comment found
fresh and vivid expression in
Imperial College Dramsoc's
production of 'Can't Pay Won't Pay
!'. Although this form of theatre
strives to stir an audience's sense of
the injustices in life, it never adopts
an intimidating tone.
On the contrary, the plot
resembles a bizarre sit-com that
spirals wildly out of control, with
bewildering and hilarious
consequences. Or, rather, an
episode of 'The Flintstones'; where
Wilma and Betty have taken part in
a riot against unfair increases in
prices down at the local
'Drugastoraus', coming home laden
with their spoils. How will they
explain this to their husbands....?
The cast of five, after a tentative
beginning, threw themselves with
fearless abandon into their parts.
Martin Pye's Giovanni ('Fred') was
diabolically self-righteous in his
naivety and admirably sustained the
many lengthy monologues. While
Mancy Amin's Antonia ('Wilma')
displayed perfect poise amid the
chaos unfolding about her.
The second couple ('The
Rubbles') were given strong
performances by Catherine Pope
and Richard Ford. But the star of
the evening for me, and it seemed
the rest of the audience, was
Stephan Kannengieber. His
depictions of those in authority
(there was a breathless array of no
less than four characters,
distinguished only by facial hair and
differing headwear. Thankfully the
accent remained constant!) as
'creatures of habit with no brain',
was aided by an accent that seemed
to span the Atlantic - lying
somewhere between Germany and
America. He brought a strange,
other-worldly quality to his lines:
Not quite how Fo may have
envisaged it, but great fun
nevertheless!
Finally, a word about the
production. The spontaneity of the
action did not always seem the
result of fore-thought, but was
constantly entertaining; bicycles
ridden through the audience, bellies
being blown up...
Altogether, a conception and
evening not easily forgotten!
I Q Q Y
T h e C a b i n e t of Dr Caligari
Although it had started off with a
half hour delay, the play was very
promising from its beginning.
Everything was there, a very
interesting story adapted from the
much revered Wiene's classic
expressionist film, relatively good
acting, appropriate music and full
audience. It looked like mysterious
Dr Caligari and his somnambulist
Cesare would take us, breathlessly
to the world of mesmerism, horror
and depravity.
However, as the play progressed
it revealed all possible mistakes in
stage managing, order of cast
appearances and changing stage
settings. Girls doing curtains could
not agree whether they had to open
or close them. From time to time
actors would appear from corners
wondering was it their turn to say
something. Although the stage itself
was relatively simple, four to five
objects in maximum, it took them
ages to change things and make
ready for the next scene. The
audience had to sit in the dark for
an unacceptably long time, forced
to listen to all sorts of noise behind
the curtains (luckily no swear
words).
It was a great pity that all these,
although important, but still only
supporting things spoiled the whole
artistic feeling of the play itself. Dr
Caligari (Harry Gendryes) was very
good. With that horrible grimace on
his face (which must be very
difficult to maintain for an hour or
so, I suppose) seemed like someone
who really knew something about
mesmerism and all those dark and
secret things. Producer and director
Maria Holzamer was on a right way
in adopting expressionist style and
pantomimic acting from the original
film which was a major
breakthrough for Art cinema in the
1920s.
If they had another week or two
for rehearsing, this might be a
remarkable play. If you still want
to give them a chance, wait for
another ten days or so (play is on
until 13 June), they might improve
by that time, otherwise don't waste
your time.

A n t o n y & C l e o p a t r a
'Antony and Cleopatra' is a noble
and spacious play. In it Shakespeare
presents a fine picture of Eastern
opulence and Roman pride. Eight
yars earlier he had written 'Julius
Caeser' and there the rivals, Antony
and Octavias, appear as comrades.
In that play the critical clash of
cares is between Antony and
Brutus;the man of action and the
idealist. The tragedy is the soul's
tragedy of Brutus. Through this
Shakespeare passed to the writing
of the four great tragedies, all of
which are concerned with the world
within, the self- torturing soul. In
'Antony and Cleopatra' he returns
to the world of great affairs and
prsents us with a play of action and
action that spans the whole range of
the Roman Empire. Here we are
witness to the full fall and
frustration of Antony, once the
'Jupitar of men...the day of the
world...the lord of lords'.
The play, in it's meaning,
structure and characterisation is
very complicated and has given rise
to a bewildering variety of
interpretations; most of which have
tended to run to extremes either of
denunciation or glorification of the
lovers. In this charming production
Anthony...
Danny B o y
This black comedy is set in
Northern Ireland and the
unbelievable plot is that Danny is
visited one day by the Angel
Gabriel. I know it sounds weird, but
what's weirder is that his parents
are named Mary and Joseph? The
characters are hardly original, are
they!
Danny then becomes Christ in
Ulster and begins to perform all
sorts of miracles, again borrowed
from someone elses life story.
The comedy is really funny and
the one liners are unlikle anything
that I have ever heard. But the
production doesn't do the humour
any favours and can dampen things
a bit.
The last play(s) that the Etcetera
wrote or produced or whatever
were nominated for fringe theatre
4 June 1993
at the Barbican,John Caird has
challengingly retained something of
the significance of the text by
simplifying nothing. The play opens
with Antony languishing in the land
of the Pharohs. As the house- lights
fade the air is filled with a faint
fragrance of perfume, the caressing,
clean aroma of luxury and
opulence. On the instant Egypt
seemed to reach out and seduce, as
it's Queen had the pillars of the
world.
Clare Higgins played Cleopatra
with all the appropriate haughter,
voluptous appeal and fickle tyranny.
While Richard Johnson's Antony
was a great titan in decline, tottering
about the stage he swiftly accended
the scale of suffering, to
unsoundness at the end. Both
breathed vividly amid the
dispassionate correctness of all
about.
With such flawed characters as
Antony and Cleopatra it is difficult
to excite close sympathy, but it is
a measure of the success of this
production that it' inspired very
poweful emotins. The run continues
into early July.
