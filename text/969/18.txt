I sometimes wonder about the
membrane of sanity and the
performance of A n Emotional Fish
provided a rich vein to tap. It wasn't
the name which even a self-
respecting Dadaist would query but
rather the lead singer's behaviour.
Whilst music is well entrenched
as visual entertainment, the wide
rolling eyes of this man would give
Rasputin a run for his money.
Contrasted by the total staticity of
the other band members, who
looked like Robert Plant and a
younger Tom Waits, the scene was
set. Look at me, I'm really mad. A
messianic figure with lanky black
fringe, obligatory tambourine in
hand, an occasional wander into the
crowd, arms outstretched, head
forced back. AH he needed was a
crown of thorns, but he asked US
if we were religious so I guess that
was enough. And there was me
thinking Koresh was dead.
Still after the first couple of songs
such behaviour tailed off and things

guitared female american band,
were - unsurprisingly - somewhat
reminiscent of the Throwing Muses.
Not bad mind you, but not to the
taste of my guest for this evening,

incapable of pretence and whose

times the Fish's high powered rock

hear. 'Robert Plant' twaggled his

enjoyed it. the set ended with 'If
God was a girl?'. The route from
tortured and emotion to tired and

'It's been a while' announces Simon
Bye, lead singer and posturing
frontman of This Picture. So it has.
Almost exactly 12 months ago, I
saw the same band on the same
stage, albeit a stage without the
assorted Axminsters and the like
with which it is bedecked tonight.
A year on, 'Naked Rain' and
'Death's Sweet Religion' sound as,
well, sweet and religious as before;
accompanied as they are tonight, by
new numbers, the new single 'High
Rise', a tower of power, and 'The
Greatest Escape' like sugar on the
senses. Rock 'n' Roll.
Support on the night in question
is provided by Surrender Dorothy.
The Oz-esque name is strangely
appropriate, as they are a lead
singer, sweet and innocent, a lovely
voice dreams of signing to RCA.
(Remember the poppies in their
field of corn, you foolish child, the
wicked witch of the rock world),
and with her motley band (sic) of
a scarecrow, a hairy lion and a tin
man.
Surrender the band, Dorothy, and
come back to Kansas, where being
pretty is probably enough.
Easi Style
opinion can only complement the
objectivity of this review.
The Auteurs started their set with
three or four acoustic numbers (
actually the Cello was electric). A
band that has songs rather than
guitar sequences with words is rare
these days. This is certainly a band
with songs. The U L U crowd, so
often a steaming sodom of thrown
hair and gnashing teeth, were this
evening a subdued, (comparatively)
older herd, obviously having come
for the music and not the noise.
To the unfamiliar, and here I
pigeon-hole my guest, the
consensus of opinion was that it was
good but you couldn't dance to it.
(Watch a Joy Division V i d
sometime).
I thought they were deadly, and
how could I be wrong.

Tonight Preview
Blur - Astoria
With a new album, 'Modern Life is
Rubbish', and something of a hit single
with 'For Tomorrow', Blur take to the
stage, ably supported by Darlingheart,
whose 'Smarthead' features on UNICD2
(reviewed this issue). Expect to hear
'There's no other way' somewhere
within their melange of choice guitar
pop and English drollery. A bargain at a
mere £7.50. 7pm.
Kingmaker - Mean Fiddler
Hunky-chunky Suede/Slade crossover
rock supported by Delicious Monster.
Put on your best Muffin' an' stompin'
gear, and watch the world call you a
wanker, 'cos that sort of thing doesn't
go on at a Kingmaker gig. £6.00.
Wynton Marsalis - Clapham Grand
He's brought his own trumpet. It's no
contest, really. Bit costly, though.
£14.50. from 7.30pm
Jamiroquai - Brixton Academy
Well, there really is too much going on
tonight, isn't there? I was laughing, and
me mate was laughing (bleeding funny),
and saying that you'll probably be in the
bar all night, won't you? Fuckin' A.
£3.00 here a few months back, £13.50
in Brixton now. The price of fame.
From 9pm
Saturday Preview
Cranes - Windsor Old Trout
And the smells?! The smells were
simply out of this world!! Supported by
Slowdive, expect to find a few widowed
goths throwing Eldritch poses by the
river. Better still, there's a burned-out
castle nearby; it's a fake, but you can't
tell now. Seven quid for Alison Shaw
performing live is well worth it, mind.
8.30 pm
Dr Alban - Subterania
£7.00. I dunno. You must have money
to burn. Why don't you just stay in and
watch the cricket with a few tinnies of
Draught Guinness? from 7pm.
The The - Brixton Academy
'Sweet Bird of Truth'. 'Infected'.
'Beat(en) Generation'. Should be fun.
£12.50. 7pm
Sunday Preview
D'Note - Ronnie Scott's
Extraordinary jazz/rap outfit, far too
cool to ignore. Their album 'Babel'
(Dorado) was reviewed in Felix 966,
and we told you that it was fuckin'
good. Don't miss. £6.00. From 8pm.
Crystal Gayle - Palladium
The only way to hear Country Music:
Syruppy and sequinned, like Marc
Almond gone rock n' roll. £19.50 -
£15. 7.30pm
More Next Week - Donny. (sic. Ed)
Out of Hiding —
Beit Hall 22.5.93
This group, led by Jan Babst (the
only Beit resident), vocal and
guitar, gave us an evening of mosdy
gentle, rather Irish, music which
was impeccably performed and
almost hypnotic in effect. Every
now and again the flow would break
into more complex rythms, with
notable flourishes from the drums
and bass. Andrew Baker and Clare
Simmons. Clare Bailey has a fresh,
natural voice, and, as lead singer,
was fantastically good—in addition
to the songs already in her
repertoire she took in her stride, at
sight, one number that the rest had
practised without giving her the
chance to learn it. I, not being
familiar with this sort of music, was
particularly struck with their
balance, the other (I must not say
second) guitar, Alex Alan,
providing much of the melodic line.
In particular, given their massive
electronic aids, the performance
was beautifully controlled.

U n d e r w o r l d 11.5.93
Biohazard—where metal meets
hardcore in a sea of flailing hair and
thrashing limbs. Despite the shitty
little venue with its unfortunately
placed pillars and knee-breaking
arrangements of monitors in front
of the stage, this is one of the most
rabid crowds I've ever seen.
I've described Biohazard in these
hallowed pages twice before, but
since you weren't paying attention
then either, they blend their
authentic New York Hardcore (and
I mean America's reaction to Punk,
not this techno/dance/rave crap that
they're all calling hardcore these
days) with furious post-deaths,
slayeresque riffling and an extra
boinginess subtle derived from
Brooklyn's hip-hop community in
an unrivalled display of energy and
aggression.
Buy their 'Urban Discipline' LP,
see them at the Marquee next
month, and don't expect to be
treated gently.
