David Irving, the controversial
revisionist historian and former
Phoenix editor, took part in a

publishing material regarded as

and upper class Nazis'. A

The missing Buckinghamshire
student who fled to London after
she was expelled from her college
has been reunited with her family.
Samantha Fox, 20, told parents Ann
and Andrew that she had run off to
London 'in a complete daze, and
hadn't a clue what to do.'
During her nine day absence,
Samantha lived at a bed-and-
breakfast in Finsbury Park, in
North London. She had been
thrown off her computer sciences
and modern languages course at
Swansea last March after initially

London Underground tried to
ensnare the Government this week,
by handing the bill to the Prime
Minister for one of his own ideas.
Denis Tunnicliffe, Underground
Managing Director, warned that
targets in the new Tube passengers'
charter 'could be affected' if the
Government did not pay out money
it had already promised. The
broadside came in the week when
Government support for the
CrossRail project was played off
against promised finance for the
Jubilee line extension to East India
Dock. The Jubilee line extension
was only temporarily saved this
week by an eleventh hour deal
cobbled together between the
project's bankers.
The comments were made at the
launch of the new Underground
passengers' charter, 'Aiming

Felix has finally noticed that the
Royal School of Mines students'
Union (RSMU) had elections for its
executive for the academic year
1993/1994.
Just before Easter the votes were
cast and the results announced in the
race for the prestigious posts at the
R S M U . As the results came
through on the slow boat to the
Felix Office, it became clear that all
posts had been filled with no
victories for the ever notorious New
Election.

reporters that, at times, 'it seemed
there was no-one to turn to', and
claimed that there was a six month
waiting list for counselling, an
allegation furiously denied by
Swansea.
The National Union of Students
says the case shows the 'continuing
stress' students are under. Samantha
has urged other students in
difficulty to seek help immediately.

counsellor, Don Adlington, is
available to see students at his office
in 15 Prince's Gardens, or can be

year's charter. Under the new
targets, 86% of customers should
be satisfied with trains and 81%
with stations, while 89% of Tube
users should be satisfied with station
cleanliness. Customer satisfaction
with staff should rise by 1% to
86%. London Transport hopes to
run the same proportion of trains at
peak times, and says that 95% of
trains should keep to the timetable.
A new refund scheme will be
introduced at the end of 1993, with
customers receiving compensation
for delays of more than 15 minutes.
28,000 refund claims were paid out
last year for delays of more than 20
minutes, costing London
Underground Â£68,000. M r
Tunnicliffe said that the charter
'was about delivering a service that
would make refunds an exception
rather than a rule. Last year's
performance has vindicated this.'

battle for Vice President of the

Imperial College Union elections,
and was organised by the steady
hand of current R S M U Vice
President Boris Pluskowski.
