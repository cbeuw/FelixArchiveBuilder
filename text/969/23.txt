Robert Jackson
-A profile
by D e c l a n Curry
Robert Jackson M P resigned as
junior science minister last week.
He will be replaced this morning by
David Davis, the London-born M P
for Boothferry in Humberside.
Mr Jackson was appointed as
junior science minister, or
Jarltamtntarn £er,retarn in the
©ffia of Public &eruicE ma
Bcitnct just after the last General
Election. He was a Parliamentary
Under-Secretary at Employment
between July 1990 and April 1992,
and at Education between June 1987
until July 1990. Mr Jackson's
political career can thus be
remembered as coinciding with
political landmarks about somebody
else. He became a junior minister
after the 1987 General Election,
changed his job when Geoffrey
Howe lost his, and then M r Jackson
lost his own when Norman Lamont
was offered Environment, sorry,
sacked.
Mr Jackson will principally be
remembered as the minister who
was arrested for causing a security
alert at Heathrow Airport by telling
security men that there was a bomb
in his ministerial red box. He will
also enter the annals of history as
the minister who lamented the latest
rise in the unemployment figures on
the day that unemployment fell for
the first time in under three years.
By comparison, M r Davis seems
to have had a rather dull political
upbringing, being Parliamentary
Private Secretary (unpaid skivvy) to
Francis Maude during 1990. In
November 1990, he was appointed
Assistant Government Whip. He
entered Parliament in 1987, and
was educated at Tooting Bee
Grammar School, Warwick
University and the London Business
School, among others.

Transport ministers are engaged in
an 'arm-bending' exercise to save
the London Travelcard. Department
of Transport officials claimed
yesterday that ministers 'are
working with operators' to ensure
the survival of the famous three inch
by two inch rectangle of cardboard.
The claims were made after
pressure group Save the Travelcard
said they had obtained a copy of the
confidential report of the
Department of Transport Working
Group on London Transport.
Expressing 'grave concern', Save
the Travelcard said the report
contradicted assertions by ministers
that the Travelcard would survive.
They claim' that the report
'repeatedly stresses the likelihood

The two College security officers
who detained a suspected thief after
a St Patrick's Day chase have been
officially commended. Michael
Sankar and Ivan Baxter have been
congratulated by Chief
Superintendent Haug'hian, of
Belgravia police, for their 'fine
work and prompt and intelligent
action' which led to the arrest.

The last Imperial College Union
(ICU) Council meeting, which
debated proposals by Chris
Davidson, I C U President, to
restructure ICU, has been described
by some as farcical.
Only three significant decisions
were made at the meeting which
lasted over 4 hours. Votes were
taken and passed on 'replacing ICU
Council with a smaller body' and
that 'all members of the Executive
Committee are to be elected by a
Union General Meeting (UGM) or
a cross-campus ballot'.
The motion that has caused the
greatest controversy centres on the
proposed position of Entertainments
Representative. This would be the
sole representative of various
recreation and entertainments sub-
that the Travelcard will disappear
as a result of privatisation and
deregulation.' The report also
apparently rules out the electronic
'Smartcard' as an alternative to the
Travelcard.
Save the Travelcard say that the
Travelcard could either be
'repriced', replaced with single
journey tickets, or restricted to
Tube-only travel. Chris Church,
director of Save the Travelcard,
said that the Department of
Transport report 'acknowledges
that the current system works well
and is popular. These new
proposals are badly thought out and
completely inadequate. London and
Londoners deserve much better
than this.'
was responsible for the
apprehension' of the man.
Meanwhile, twenty-two bicycles
have been stolen from around
college since April. Only three of
the bikes were 'D-locked'. College
security remind students that 'D-
locks' are sold at Security Control
in the Sherfield Building. Any
suspicious activity around cycle
parks or around College should be
reported immediately to Sherfield
Security on internal telephone 3372.

committees on the new executive
committee. In the current system
the chair of each concerned sub-
committee sits on Council. The
motion stated that 'the
Entertainments Representative can
represent the Social, Cultural and
Amusements Board (SCAB) and
Rag' on the new Executive
Committee. The motion was
passed, though the Rag Chair and
the SCAB Chair voted against it.
Council did admit that it 'did not
have the mandate to make ICU
policy' and that TCU policy could
only be made at a U G M ' . Hence,
any changes to ICU will have to be
passed at a U G M . M r Davidson's
proposals are scheduled to be
presented at the next U G M , which
will take place on Friday 25th June,
the last day of term.
