The Rovers Return
In a completely unprecedented move,Donny O'Nonchalant and Declan
Curry crown their heads with cynicism, put on threadbare robes of
coherence, and usurp the Empire
It was once said that the second
world war had produced One
Victor, the USA, One Villain,
Germany, and One Hero, Great
Britain. That the United Kingdom
has portrayed a somewhat
exaggerated sense of nobility in
international circles is almost
certainly true. Even British failures
are ascribed a peculiar heroism.
Robert Falcon Scott and Roald
Amundsen, in their race for the
pole, are examples of such
historical treatment; Scott, beaten,
does not outlive his failure, dying
heroically in the inhospitable wastes
of antarctica. Amundsen,
successful, lives until a fateful
expedition in 1928. British history
has periodically portrayed him as
clinical, Germanic, soulless.
Another example of sense of
humour failure, inhuman
efficiency, and being first with the
beach towels. While I may be
accused of anti-nationalist
propaganda or, god forbid,
cosmopolitan sympathies, it is
striking, is it not, how romantically
we view our role in the international
community.
Or did. In the forty years since
the coronation of Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth II, the British
perspective of itself has changed a
little; that is to say it doesn't look
directly at itself anymore, although
it is only our own history
persuading us that it ever did. As
a people, again, we demonstrate
ourselves to have some small talent
for ascribing our motives to the
actions of others, and then
condemning them for it, c.f.
Maastricht, and media inferences
regarding the would-be
machinations of those in Brussels
(buzzwords include 'potty',
'barmy', and 'Euro-bureaucrats').
Expect jingoistic cartoon strips, and
children's fiction to uphold the
British Way, salute the flag, warm
the pants of those bally jackanapes
from Berlin, Belgium, Bratislava...
To the process of self-examination:
If the forty-year reign of one
monarch does not provoke a
retrospective scrutiny, then nothing
will. Failing that, I suppose the
Bicentenary of the United Kingdom
in 2003 may encourage a little navel
contemplation.
Eight years from the war, the surviving colonial advances in
foundations of the welfare state set 1993, there is Australia, whose
mmmmi^
by the 1945 Labour Government
well in place, and into Churchill's
second term of office. Stalin's death
spared us another war and no small
embarrassment, Korea was an
unfortunate aside of which we had
little involvement, but we were
prime minister, Paul Keating,
makes public demands for
Australian independence, and
familiar gestures (a caress here, a
stroke there) to the head of state.
Then there is Northern Ireland.
Enough said. Even Scotland cries
busy anyway, conscripting young
men to conduct nuclear weapons
testing out in the pacific. We were
busy elsewhere, too, seceding vast
areas of land back to its original
owners, after having been
responsible for little or no
improvement. Of the U K ' s sole
out for devolution from
Westminster, and what precisely
does European Union mean when
our Government quite evidently has
goals differing from those of our
neighbours? John Donne's famous
'No man is an island' utterance is
looking increasingly in need of the
codicil 'Unless the island is me.'
And there's new music on the
streets; an underground tune that
was sung throughout the 1920s and
1930s, remixed for the 90s. Ever
since the first influx to Britain of
coloured immigrants in the fifties,
through the exodus of Indians,
Pakistanis, Bangladeshis, and
Ugandan asians forced out by Idi
Amin in the sixties and seventies,
culminating in the Vietnamese and
Hong Kong refugees taking up the
last decade. Europe-wide, the
swagger, the jackboot, the very
short haircut, and the crooked
attitude worn on the sleeve, are
making their resurgence. In Britain,
Tory Nationalists, from Enoch
Powell to his disgraced acolyte,
Harvey Proctor, have campaigned
vociferously for repatriation.
Proctor's own concern, the right-
wing Monday Club, provoked mass
hysteria in 1984 when it was
revealed to have been infdtrated by
fascists. The British record on race
relations reveals many sensitive
areas; Viraj Mendis, forced to take
sanctuary in a Manchester church
to avoid deportation to Sri Lanka,
the Tamil refugees stripping naked
at Heathrow for the same reason,
the furore caused by Dr Siddiqui
and the Muslim Parliament, and the
argument between religion and law
over Salman Rushdie's novel 'The
Satanic Verses'. Book-burning,
followed by a holy fatwa from the
Iranian Imam, followed by the
support of Yusuf Islam, followed by
record-burning. Organisations such
as the British National Party,
National Front, Combat 18 etc,
have capitalised on this
dissatisfaction and are making
substantial progress in recruiting the
dispossessed and the
disenfranchised of British youth.
There is no shortage of those
willing to be foot soldiers for the
new Right, replacing the Horst
Wessels of the twenties with the
Kevins, the Brians, and the Darrens
of the nineties. It seems a rising
number of what we might call
'ethnic Britons' are none too happy
with this island's current state of
cultural diversity.
And then we have the island
itself, this 'precious jewel set in a
silver sea' guarding itself 'against
