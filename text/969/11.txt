- 'Oh, around sixty quid.'
- 'And what kind of clients do you
get?'
- 'Oh, all kinds. Just normal,
average men.'
- 'What jobs do they normally
have?'
- 'All kinds, businessmen... even
journalists..'
- 'Ah. Any students?'
- 'Yeah, I have students.'
- 'So, where are you situated?'
- 'In May fair.'
- 'Really? Have you had any
famous people?'
- 'Of course.'
- 'Who?'
All my journalistic instincts were
excited at the prospect of getting
some gossip but I was dissappointed
- 'I'm sorry, love, I can't teE you.
It's purely confidential.'
- 'Can't you just be vague and tell
me what kind of job they hold.'
- 'I'm sorry'
I gleaned a little more
information like the busiest nights
are Fridays and such like but at last
she told me that she had to keep her
Friday evening I visited Soho with
its sex shops, strip shows and what
not. I was quite innocently (honest,
Your Honour) wandering around
some backstreet off Charing Cross
Road when two girls approached
me. One was coloured, the other of
apparently black-caucasian roots.
She was the taller, better looking of
the two and did all the talking. She
was really likeable.
'Hiya, love. Do you want some
tonight?'
'How much?'
'Twenty pounds for half an
hour.' This, I thought, was
extraordinarily cheap. I thought
they were all priced around the
forty pound mark like the 'phone
call girls. M y surprise must have
shown on my face because she
laughed:'I know, I'm worth more
ain' I? You're surprised aren' you?'
'Yeah, yeah. Where would we go?'
'My appartment. It's around a
minutes walk away.'
I shan't claim that I wasn't
'phone line free so that her clients
could contact her. I thanked her and
hung up.
Spanking Lessons by Busty Black
Model (373 8576) and Massage by
Caribean Mistress (373 5956)
proved, embarrassingly enough, to
be the same woman who in both
instances wouldn't co-operate.
While Miss Electra (Fully equipped
for restrictive punishment fantasies
- 937 9874) was similarly unwilling
to talk.
- 'Hi, I just saw your advert in a
'phone booth...'
- 'Where are you?'
- 'Erm... South Ken.'
- 'Right. We're just around the
corner in Earls Court. If you come
about.
- 'Wait! Let me explain.' So I did.
I just wanted an interview. She said
that she wasn't allowed to by her
employer and hung up.
Right, so much for the telephone
call girls, the cheaper ones are on
the streets. Go around Soho at about
eleven at night and you can hardly
fail to meet some. On a boring
tempted. Any normal man would
have been.
'Tell you what. Go around the
block if you want. I'll probably be
here when you come back.'
'Will you be here tomorrow?'
'No. I'm off Saturdays unless you
want to make an appointment. I'll
be here Sunday though.'
'Okay, cheers.'
I thought I'd be more
embarrassed being offered sex but
I wasn't. I was also surprised just
how easy it is to get if you're
willing to spend a bit of cash. Lets
face it: London is a sexy city. It
simply oozes atmosphere. You can
be in one of the most exclusive
districts in the world and ten
minutes walk later be in the
seediest. You can, if you have the
money, realise your most purvy
fantasies. These girls are just out to
make a living like anybody else by
offering the public just one more
luxury service. How involved you
get is up to you.
