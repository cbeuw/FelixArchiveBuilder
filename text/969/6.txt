Dear Jonty,
It was suggested by a
disrespectful bunch of young snots
that I should be run over by the bus.
Which bus? The no. 10, no. 29 or
Sarah Welsh? They don't have a
clue about managing to get up in the
morning, let alone running events
that people want to go to. They
don't seem to recognise
achievement or commitment to
boot.
Perhaps this is why they snubbed
their own Honorary Senior
Treasurer Dr Paul Ewing by not
even awarding him Colours, full or
half which most people seem to get
for walking through the union office
door nowadays. In addition, Dr
Shaun Crofton, M r Colin Rogers
and M r John Impey have all put in
considerable amounts of time and
effort into helping the Union out
and received no thanks. This is both
insulting and completely
unacceptable.
I noted with interest that the
young snots managed to award
themselves, but then again it's
probably the only chance they'll get
to put an honour on their C V .
So far this year the Freshers'
Week event was poorly attended,
the Boat Party was cancelled, the
Careers talks got little interest and
Ice Skating couldn't muster up a
group discount. The Pub Pursuits
got little interest, the second one
was in fact cancelled. The Disaster
and Dance lost money and 35%
fewer people attended than in
previous years. Speaking of
disasters, the May Ball was
cancelled before it could become a
disaster.
The more astute readers will
notice the absence of the Guilds
Brighton run. From the above list.
It did happen but it was organised
by the Motor Club. The Hotel was
packed out and the event made a
profit, which Guilds kept. The
hiring of a Motor racing circuit
made so much money it paid for the
coming trip outright. The other
Motor Club dinners did not lose a
penny either so it would appear that
the C & G Motor Club know what
they're doing and that there are a
fair few incompetents disorganising
Guilds and wasting student money.
This probably goes some way to
explaining why they view the Motor
Club and its officers with contempt,
of which I am one.
I sincerely hope the new Guilds
exec can build on the success of
events they organised for the 'year
in industry' students and not make
the mistakes that many of this year's
exec have. Then again, it's barely
surprising when the numbers are
made up with a coke head and an
incompetent.
Yours sincerely,
Gavin J R Pearson, Mech Eng 3.
What is the meaning of truth
Dear Jonty,
A few quick points. It's good to
see Owain is back, and as witty as
ever. Phil's column is maintaining
its bite and drawing blood, and he's
making a good fist of some other
sections as well. Others will only
get big headed, but there's a definite
whiff of improvement. Well done,
Sir.
I'm also delighted to see the
response to recent news articles. At
last, life... Thanks to Bruce
Cartwright in Beit for some solid
points, and to Jim Bichard in
Biology.
Jim is, of course, correct in his
well crafted letter. The Times
league tables are regarded as
important in some sectors, but they
are not as important, or indeed as
significant, as they are made out to
be. In the main, it's a fair cop.
'Jingoism' is a fair word to use in
describing my earlier article. Why
was it written? Why was it run?
Felix is not as editorially
independent as we would like to
think it is. The Union General
Manager asks for a staff protocol,
so try not to name them. The Union
President insists we toe the party
line, but then Chris has real
problems with freedom, democracy
and the like. College management
'request' we print good news, so we
do, as by some perversion they
might control our funding in a few
months. The Rector threatens us
when we write about the Governing
Body. One Governor mentioned
libel, once.
Perhaps we should change our
name. Pravda has a truthful ring to
it, if nothing else
A few pettifogging details,
though. The comments about Rag
were a touch unfair. The success of
the boat club was and is well
charted on these pages. Jonty did
not interfere in the writing of the
Times story.
I'm glad Jim had the courage to
answer back. Not many do.
Sometimes, I doubt if we have that
courage.
Declan Curry,
outsider, pissing in.

Billed beyond belief
Dear Jonty,
Yesterday I received a letter in
my hall pigeonhole (noticebly ten
days after the letter was dated)
which claimed I had not paid my
accomodation bill. This threatened
"I would remind you that you are
now incurring penalty charges at the
rate of £1 per day If you do
nothing about this letter you will
only put yourself deeper into debt''.
This was in fact incorrect. My
bill was paid on 19th May 1993 and
I still have the reciept and switch
reciept to prove this.
Perhaps the accomodation offices
energies could be better spent
chasing up unpaid bills and those of
persistent non-payers as highlighted
in the letters page of Felix 967.
Yours sincerely,
Duncan Austin
I love you too Gavin
Dear Jonty,
I have heard rumours, ill-founded
they may be (but I doubt it), that a
certain M r G J R Pearson is having
a sense of humour failure with the
'so long as he gets run over by the
bus' comment (Felix 968). I have
been led to believe that he is
retailiating with a vicious attack on
the Guilds Exec of 92-93. What a
shame. I am devastated. As, I am
sure, are the rest of the Guilds
Exec, as we all know full well that
he is, as usual, full of uninteresting,
mundane, destructive criticism that
we have all heard before. If any
Felix reader wishes to know of
Gavin's personal gripes against the
Union, then please, come and talk
to me and I will personally
introduce you to him. I am sure that
I will have a queue at my door
saying 'Please, please I want to talk
to Gav, he sounds so interesting'.
I am told, on good authority, that
our dear Gav thinks that myself,
and Sarah Welsh (C&GCU Hon
Sec) wrote the 'so long as he gets
run over by the bus' statement,
hence the retaliation. Gavin, you
are wrong.
As Guilds president this year, I
have had to listen to M r G J R
Pearson's constant loud
commentary on the Union. A l l
year, I don't believe I have heard
a single piece of constructive
criticism pass his lips. In fact, when
pressed, all he could come up with
was 'Get a life—join the Motor
Club'. Hrnmmm. Very useful.
I hope I am not insulting the
intelligence of the Felix readership
to suggest that, just maybe, M r
Perason is not just suffering from
a severe case of sense of humour
failure, but also a delusion of
self-importance.
As I do not wish to have a 'letter
for letter' war in the pages of Felix
with M r Pearson, I do hope that this
will be the end of the matter.
However, I doubt this very much,
as I have great faith in the literary
genius of said M r G J R Pearson,
to come up with something equally
interesting and stimulating for your
readers in future issues of Felix. I
will however guarantee that this will
be my O N L Y and last input into this
argument.
As a footnote, I would like to
add, that if anyone, anywhere, has
any serious and constructive
criticism about Guilds or the
general running of a C C U , please
do not hesitate to contact me, or any
of the Exec, in the Guilds Office,
Rm 340, Mech Eng.
Yours sincerely,
Kute Dalton,
President C&GCU (92-93)
age 6
