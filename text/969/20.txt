Exhibition
Well, there's good, bad and ugly.
And if you want to see the last two
of these, go over to the Whitechapel
Gallery. Out in the crumbling lands
beyond the bomb-shattered golden
towers of the city, lies a small
temple dedicated to modern art. The
gallery is a beautiful creation of
light and space, which one would
think would enhance any exhibition.
Unfortunately, the art on display
does not do it justice. The Ugly is
Tony Bevan. His paintings are
portraits and hands, emphasising
only the surface unpleasantness. He
uses lurid red and orange
backgrounds to surround his lumpy,
fleshy renditions of people, in a
style reminiscent of the Late Great
Francis Bacon. Bevan's pictures,
however, are worthless in
comparison.
His faces and hands are painted
with deft, expressionist strokes of
the brush, enhancing distorted
features and the wrinkled folds in
Felix 969
the skin, emphasising the bodily
nature of the human. Somewhat
incongruously the rest of the picture
is almost abstract, with hair reduced
to snaking black lines around the
features and backgrounds reduced
to suicidal black and crimson. The
faces stare out at the viewer with a
mixture of blankness and
incomprehension. The artist has
somehow removed all life from his
subjects- This may have been
purposeful, but it only seems to
emphasize a lack of technical
ability. His main picture, "The
Meeting" (Most of the other
exhibited works are studies for this
one) says it all. A large collection
of canvasses depicting lumpy,
vacant old men with their mouths
open. One feels that they must be
yawning with boredom or laughing
in derision. I certainly felt like
doing both. Bevan's work is nothing
new? it's just a mixture of styles
used by other artists recently. He
uses none of the techniques well,
and the result is instantly
forgettable.
The Bad is Piotr Nathan. His
exhibits are 'installation works',
works designed specifically for a
particular gallery. He is the epitome
of all that is wrong with
contemporary art. Using cheap
methods to shock the viewer (urine
stains) and obvious political
statements, his work is full of the
mindless pretension that gives art a
bad name. Take, for instance, the
large collection of plaster casts of
bullet holes in walls. The title is
"The outline of the place that was
bombed in the last days of the war
follows the contour of a urine mark
that emerged on the mattress of a
person dying from aids.". Need I
say more?
If you feel like seeing some good
contemporary art then don't go to
the Whitechapel Gallery. It seems
a shame that, while there are many
potentially good artists in this
world, the ones who achieve
acclaim are the ones who produce
such poindess work. Nobody really
appreciates this stuff apart from the
small, narcissistic group of
followers who also enjoy pissing on
sheets and calling it' 'Art''. No one
else would, they would only laugh
or sigh (like me). And, if they want
to make some world shattering
political statement, then they should
either learn to write or learn to paint
real, powerful pictures—after all,
Picasso did, and his "Guernica" is
still a powerful and motivating as
it was in the thirties. I doubt that this
exhibition will be remembered in a
month, and I hope it isn't.

Orchestra
I C S O 2 1 . 5 . 9 3
It's been a great year for IC
Symphony Orchestra, starting with
their Hungary tour last September.
A balletic thread has linked their
three subsequent concerts: Romeo
and Juliet last Christmas, a
triumphant Rite of Spring last term,
and a fortnight ago the programme
included the Prelude a l'apres midi
d'u faune and dances from Falla's
Three Cornered Hat. ICSO's wind
soloists were the icing on the cake;
James Layland's flute solo in the
Debussy Prelude had one
rummaging in the adjectives box for
expressions such as mellifluous,
diaphanous, and that useful word
meaning 'with interestingly
suggestive fruity bits in it' that slips
my mind just at the moment.
Clarinets, solo flute and cor anglais
also shone in the Falla.
It was good to hear an IC
performer in the concerto item, and
refreshing that Stephen Tarlton
should choose with the Ravel G
major piano concerto to stray a little
from the well-beaten path trodden
by recent soloists. Fresh and jazzy
in the outer movements, lyrical in
the central Adagio, it's a lovely
piece, especially when played as
well as it was here.
Pain Of Y o u t h
Despite the title, this play started
out on a lively and sarcastic note
and looked quite promising. On the
way home however, instead of
boarding the tube, I was strongly
tempted to throw myself under it.
Portraying the possible pain
experienced in late youth (ie late
teens), this play graphically and
powerfully gives a feel of what life
may be like for us young people.
Lines like '...you might as well
kill yourself when your
seventeen...' drown the humour
some what and give you that
suicidal feeling.
The final work was Britten's
Young Person's Guide to the
Orchestra, which spotlights each
section in turn. Highlights were
Andrew Miller's faultless oboe
playing, the excellent horn section,
and a jaunty xylophone solo.
Conductor Richard Dickins, who
had prepared this varied and
challenging programme over a
shorter period than usual, was
recalled several times to the
podium, and welcomed each time
with obvious enthusiasm by
orchestra and audience alike.
Titus Drum.
All luvvies and darlings were
born for the roles, especially the
characters of old man, Alt and the
baby faced Petrell, and the set, I
thought, could be one of the best at
a fringe theatre that I have ever
seen.>
This play speaks volumes for
todays youth and is worth seeing.
Don't expect to laugh, but expect
to watch a remarkable play, all be
it on the depressing side.
