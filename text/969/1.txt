Realisation Forte at Queens
by D e c l a n Curry
The Science community has given
muted approval to the Science
White Paper, which plans to abolish
the advisory boards, upgrade the
status of the MSc degree, and
shuffle the research councils. Dr
Dai Rees, secretary of the Medical
Research Council (MRC) said he
was 'pleased to see the bold and
realistic approach' the White Paper
was taking 'to the many urgent
issues currently facing U K science
and technology.'
The changes to the Research
Councils have been widely
welcomed. The Agricultural and
Food Research Council (AFRC)
'welcomed the expansion in its
responsibilities to become the
Biotechnology and Biological
Sciences Research Council.'
Professor Tom Blundell, AFRC
Director General said 'the move
recognises the coming of age of
biology-based technologies and
their enormous potential for
industrial innovation.'
The Royal Society hailed the
White Paper as 'offering a
promising framework for the future
development of science and
technology in Britain,' but
cautioned that the 'new Engineering
and Physical Sciences Research
Council (EPSRC) will have to adopt
an enlightened long term policy.'
The EPSRC was formed out of the
old Science and Engineering
Research Council (SERC), which
said that 'the increase in the number
of Research Councils from five to
six misses an opportunity.' Sir
Mark Richmond, SERC Chairman
also said he was 'disappointed that
the new Councils will have no
increased resources.'
Professor John Knill, Natural
Environment Research Council
(NERC) chairman, said they had
been 'piloting the idea of the one
year MSc course plus a three year
PhD course,' a major proposal in
the White Paper. Dr Dai Rees of the
MRC 'welcomed sensible proposals
on the reform of postgraduate
education and the management of
research staff in universities.' Dr
David Harrison, chairman of the
Committee of Vice Chancellors and
Principals (CVCP) said they
'welcomed the Government's
intention to review the management
of the PhD.' Chris Hamblade, of
the National Union of Students, said
he was concerned about the
reduction in the number of available
three year PhD courses.
Dr Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's
Charter spokesman, deplored the
dearth of measures in the White
Paper designed to improve the
status of women in science and
technology. 'The Government's
solution to the problem is simply to
set up another committee. British
women scientists and engineers
need fewer empty promises and
more action,' Dr Mowlam told a
Newcastle conference.
Professor Howard Newby,
chairman of the Economic and
Social Research Council said he
was 'very sad about the intention
not to create a separate Humanities
Research Council.' Dr David
Harrison said 'the CVCP regrets the
Government's failure to support the
establishment of a Humanities
Research Council.'
Her Majesty the Queen celebrated forty years on the throne this we
writes Declan Curry. This landmark was celebrated at Imperial by the
loud ringing of the bells in Queen's Tower. There was also a 41-gun sa
in Hyde Park and a 62-gun salute at the Tower of London. Such even
are dictated by the Department for the Environment, and local
campanologists offer their services free to the College.
Her Majesty is the official College 'visitor', and has the power to
intercede in disputes between College members. By cruel twist ofhi
this power has been delegated to the Education Secretary, to whit, J
Patten. Disputes between students, staffand college are settled inter
as, officially, only members of the Governing Body are College membe

visit to Imperial College, when she opened the Haldane Library on 2
November, 1969.
