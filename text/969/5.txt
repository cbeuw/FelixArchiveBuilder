Close them down
Dear Jonty,
Last week I decided it was time
I contributed a letter to Felix rather
than just sitting on my arse and
reading it. I had actually intended
to write a reply to the worthless
drivel written about Mr. Pearson by
our wonderfully competent,
friendly and efficient Shitty and
Guilds office. I do, incidentally
hope and believe that our next
year's exec, messrs Griffith,
Baguley etc. will turn this farce
around. However, today I found a
better and more worthwhile subject
about which to moan.
On my way home I use
Gloucester road tube station, only
this time it was a little more
difficult. Due (I was told by the
station manager) to recent
government decisions to
'rationalise' our underground
system and reduce running costs by
sacking 5000 staff and then
expecting the system to continue
service normally, the ticket office
was closed, not temporarily but for
the whole day as there were simply
no staff to man it. The alternative
was the automatic ticket machines,
well known for reliability and their
Okay, I admit it. There is more than
a whiff of Jon Ronson's Time Out
column to my good old 'Slice of
Life'. A strange coincidence?
Actually I met Jon at a go-cart
convention in Merthyr Tydfil some
three years ago. I can't recall
exactly how we got talking, as I
remember I saw his feet sticking out
from under the chassis and we just
began from there.
We got talking about writing and
journalism, hitting upon an
unbeatable concept. A weekly
feature packed full of misogynist
bigotry and slanted observation that
would leave no nutcase uncracked.
Afterwards he grew cynical and
took the concept to Time Out,
achieving fame and fortune as
'Columnist of the Year' whilst I
mellowed and wrote poems about
old ladies and their laundry buckets.
Am I jealous? Hell no—you see
whereas Jon can only point and
laugh at all the wacky crazies out
there I've the advantage that I am
one of those wacky crazies! It's true
I don't fight for the rights of kitchen
appliances nor do I hold wedding
services for sensitive men with
ponytails and consenting cuddly
rodents. However I do read The
infrequent use of the ' E X A C T
M O N E Y O N L Y ' legend. These
were of course virtually inoperative
as they had no change and were not
accepting 50P or £1 coins as the
collection bins were full. As I did
not happen to have 26 10P coins on
me for a travelcard, silly me, I was
forced to travel without a ticket,
prime fodder for a prowling ticket
inspector. As a regular paying
customer I object to having to travel
without a ticket. To register my
complaint I had the station manager
give me the 'phone number of a Mr.
Nick Agnew, District line general
manager, amazingly enough when
I rang at 4 o'clock there was nobody
in the office but if I would like to
leave a message.... Perhaps a good
cost cutting measure was deemed to
be sacking all the staff customers
could complain to, and thus cut the
number of dissatisfied customers at
a stroke!
It would seem then that M r .
Major is going to work the usual
Conservative party magic on our
underground system and turn it into
an underfunded collapsing system
(just like higher education really) or
is he just going to make it profitable
Guardian and quite frankly, for Jon,
that's qualification enough.
Saturday morning, the 'Islington
Green Fair'. I'm there in my role
as carer and Earth-Saver (and thus
lunatic), selling 'Fair Trade' coffee
to the masses. For the puzzled 'Fair
Trade' basically involves giving
some money to the people who
grow the goods, rather than merely
giving money to large plantation
corporations to spend bashing up
those who actually grow the goods.
It began badly enough, my
partner in righteous crime, Mark,
gets hit for a forty quid parking
ticket after Neil, a thirty something
Wppy-thing, advises him to shift the
car over to a loading area outside
his Oxfam shop. Neil is the kind of
guy who believes we should all
commute to work on organically fed
family sized Yaks (oh yes), so quite
why Mark listened to him remains
a bone (well, we're all veggies, a
baked bean...) of contention. But as
I always say, if you can't trust a
hippy who can you buy your Hash
from?
We load up on coffee,
promotional material and a curious
game constructed out of doorbells.
This consists of a range of questions
enough to sell off, so that the well
heeled who fund his election
campaigns can make more money
at our expense.
The latter part of this letter is a
personal view of the situation, not
a statement of fact and as such is not
intended to provoke response from
our, no doubt, large contingent of
with corresponding possible
answers, each answer coupled with
a button. Pressing the wrong
answer produces an infuriating
buzz, pressing the correct button an
infuriating bell. A better design
would wire the buttons to the
genitals of the participant. Any
curious corporate scum trying out
the game would be far more likely
to remember that the answer to
'How many people will die fighting
for democracy this year?' is not
'Who cares provided we're selling
them the hardware' if it was
accompanied by the smell of char-
grilled flesh below.
At the green our first task is to
obtain a stall. We find the 'funny
little man in tweed trousers and
DM's and he gives us a choice. We
can take the empty spot next to the
'Karma and Spiritual Commodities
Company' or the 'Animal Rights'
people. I couldn't stand the thought
of spending the day watching
disciples buying plastic buddha
shaped key rings to deposit their
dying soul inside so we choose the
latter. The table overfows with
slogans, some decent enough, some
seemingly a little mad—'Fish is
Suicide' leaflets and 'Nits have
feelings too' t-shirts.
We set up, begin to explain our
case and sell our coffee. At first we
stand demurely behind our wares,
giving wisdom only to those who
budding young Conservatives
which I assume we have to go with
our ' I . C . spoddy wankers',
trainspotting first year physicists,
no life DramSoc members and our
highly revered and feared Alex
'SAS' Taverner.

seek it. Unfortunately we get just
one customer in the first hour, the
only other person who approaches
our stall out is ajuggler who's heard
about our Sellotape. (Amongst my
people all is shared—the Earth, the
air, the water and the double sided).
Our friend Lindsey revitalises our
spirits with a round of jam
doughnuts but morale is low. Mark
begins making wisecracks,
suggesting to the animal rights man
that he go liberate the rabbit
residing in an Islington City Farm
promoters dungarees. There is only
one choice.
We abandon being right on and
verily assault the crowd. I rush out
with a pile of promotional leaflets,
jumping in the way of hapless
passers-by and railroading them to
our stall. At the stall Mark
shamelessly convinces them that it's
buy the coffee or take the first flight
to the fires below. We're cash
hungry pimps, preying on
insecurities. The money comes in
thick, sticky and fast. For a moment
we consider slipping some
timeshare sales in there but
saindiness wins over in the end.
The people are told, the coffee is
sold. Sitting on the lawn at
lunchtime, veggie burger in hand,
there seems some hope for the
world. And then the doorbell game
breaks, the interminable buzzing
ceases and I know there is.
