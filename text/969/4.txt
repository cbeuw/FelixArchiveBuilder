Back row leave
Dear Editor,
Being the perpertrators of the
'Sonic the Hedgehog' campaign
(those self-effacing, self-gratifying
gits), we would like to add our
voices to the "The sun shines out of
Imperial's ass' debate. We were
deceived into coming here—
obviously everyone wants to leave
university at the end of three or four
years with an Imperial degree and
good job prospects. But at what
cost? Isn't university meant to be
the best years of your life? Good
times all the time, the romance of
living on a shoe-string, taxpayers
footing the bill for all-night parties
and all-day sleeping. The reality is
somewhat more prosaic 'a
preponderance of grey scientists' to
paraphrase one student guide,
'sensible shoes and anoraks abound'
to quote another. But heh, we're in
London, and 'life's what you make
of it'. Now correct me if I'm wrong
but that's a load of bollocks. These
are the guys (no sexism there, you
know the ratio) that you have to
hang around with all day. College
dominates your life, especially at
IC, almost to the exclusion of
association with people outside of
its domain.
The problem is the reputation is
intrinsically bound up with the sad
nature of this hallowed institution's
occupants (inmates?). This place
weeds out those who do not follow
the strict, regimented order of
study, those who didn't join the
trainspot soc when they got here.
Where is the creativity? What the
hell happened when Civ Eng built
that sports complex? Perhaps we
should merge with an arts college.
Who has killed the life in these
monochrome parodies of human
beings, these husks, mere shells
who have been beaten into
obedience by the system? By the
end of the first year, large swathes
of people who have not subscribed
to the system's beliefs have been
eradicated by it. Failed or left: and
good luck to 'em.
Have you noticed other London
students' attitude towards you when
you tell them you're from
Imperial—social lepers or what?
By the way, whilst Imperial's
been strutting its stuff about how
good it is (according to the Times
chart), its international reputation,
etc, take a look at the score for its
teaching (32 out of 80): way below
not only Cambridge, but most other
universities in the country.
Well 'nuff said. We're leaving.
We admit defeat. You've weeded
out these saps.

Anarchy
Dear Jonty,
Following the article on the
Anarchist Cookbook (by William
Powell, Barricade Books, £18), I
realised I named the wrong street:
every place described is Charing
Cross Road, not Oxford Street.
Sorry for those who wasted time
looking there, and thanks for
pointing out the mistake.
Also, for those who went to raid
the local stores for Morning Glory,
the active species are 'Heavenly
Blue' (Ipomea Violeacea), 'Pearly
Gates', 'Wedding Bells', 'Summer
Skies', 'Blue Star' and 'Flying
Saucers' and you've got to bloody
grind them first, though it's none of
my business why you'd want to do
that. Please remember some brands
coat their seeds in poison.

Ridiculous
Dear Jonty,
'the most effective way of
attacking vice is to expose it to
public ridicule. People can put up
with rebukes but they cannot bear
being laughed at: they are prepared
to be wicked but they dislike
appearing ridiculous'.
I therefore do not believe these
rumours about Sir Eric Ash wanting
to spend £100,000 on further
refurbishment of 170 Queensgate,
that would be patently ridiculous.
Yours thoughtfully,
Moliere.
Sonia's OK
Dear Jonty,
I am writing in response of Sonia
Shah's item in Felix 967 about the
Dalai Lama. Many important issues
were raised and dealt with clearly
and in an informative way. It is
good that Felix covers these events
and supports cases where human
rights are so obviously being
denied.
And! Not a single gratuitous use
of the word 'fuck'. Well done.
More please...
