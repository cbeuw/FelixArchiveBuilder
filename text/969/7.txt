Perspective on '68
Dear Editor,
I read with some interest your
article on May '68, but the causes
for present apathy didn't come out
clearly. Jonty Beavan mentions Ian
Pigg (NUS General Sec) who puts
the blame on middle-class
upbringing: students want a good
job not a revolutionary country.
While this is partly true, there are
a number of facts that need to be
pointed out:
The May '68 revolution was
started by sons and daughters of the
elite: middle- and upper-class
citizens who wanted a new world.
They were part of the post-war
baby-boom; they needed extra
accommodation and education
facilities. The government didn't
plan for it immediately and had to
build hastily new campuses,
preferably in the suburbs. These
buildings were basically lifeless
slabs of concrete. How could
students accept this, especially if
they were the country's best? Like
in 1789, the May '68 revolution
was ignited by people who felt they
deserved more, namely the
bourjeouis, or middle-class.
What made their lives duller still
were the strict (and often petty)
rules by which they were
surrounded: no visits to girls' rooms
in the evening, no 'modern' music,
to name two. Their environment
was stiffling: relations with teachers
were cold and distant. Lecturers
didn't feel human and demanded
utter respect. Also, on the political
side, De Gaulle had been in control
for ten years by then, with only one
amendment to the constitution (in
1961). Students were practically
forbidden to criticise the
government. Even the ORTF
(television and radio) was run by the
state. Things only started moving
when the left came to power,
especially under Miterrand. How
can students, the intellectual elite,
be forbidden to express themselves?
This explains the meaning of The
Guardian's words: 'a saddled old
society' which had to be taken 'on
a fantastic liberating curve'.
My second point is that none of
the above occur presently in
England, or for that matter in the
UK. Although, student poverty is
a problem of some concern for a
number among us, our lives (social,
not academical, that is) are far from
dreary and dictated by law. Sex,
drink and music are common and
certainly not restricted. Chris
Davidson changed ICU constitution
with little or no interference from
the State. How can one complain?
The cause for apathy is the fact that
nothing bothers students seriously
and any trouble can be rapidly
remedied thanks to Dep Reps and
Flip chart abuse
To continue a recent
theme... 'Neither use nor ornament,
those sabbaticals! Take that
President of ours, the Scottish
plonker, what's he up to? Nine
months of focus groups, working
parties, council meetings and what
does he have to show for it....A
new Union structure and a drink
problem. True, true, the members
of the working group spent hours,
days even, putting together what
should be a Union that will serve
its members into the next century,
in terms of social athletic, academic
and welfare needs. They have
consulted hundreds of people,
recorded hours of tape, written
endless reports...That's another
thing, reports..
'What the point anyway?
Voluntary membership, that's the
usual excuse, pathetic, You'd think
they wanted the Union to be useful
or something. That's not what
Unions are for! They always have
and always should be full of
bureaucratic meetings and hours of
wasting time. After all, everybody
loves being in meetings all night.
Getting involved in the Union
should be difficult. Well, we don't
want any old student walking in and
changing everything, it has worked
this way for nigh on fifty years and
should stay like it is. Regardless of
whether it does its job.'
'I'll tell you what, the Union
General Meeting on Friday the 25th
of June inthe Junior Common Room
should be a laugh. We'll show that
Chris Davidson what we think of a
customer focused Union...'
That's what Lionel Blair thinks of
the Union restructuring, what do
you think?
Next week Chris Davidson in flip
chart abuse shocker!
This has been a party political
broadcast on behalf of the Union
Structure Working Party.
ICU. If there was any matter truly
wrong and not solved, I can assure
attention will be drawn upon it very
quickly. Another cause for apathy
is the actual educational system. ' A '
Levels don't often entail more than
three or four subjects. In France for
the Baccaloureat, you have around
ten subjects: in addition to maths,
physics, chemistry and biology you
have history and philosophy, and if
you wish sociology and economics.
These give you the background
necessary to understand revolution.
Who at IC can claim to know
Trotsky's work? Who at IC knows
the difference between the first and
the second International?—probably
no more than the advocates of
international socialism. I should
perhaps point out this was also the
demise of the May '68 revolution.
The students usually understood the
meaning of their movement, but the
nine million strikers didn't. They
just wanted shorter hours and more
money. De Gaulle was able to
manipulate them (thanks to the
ORTF) before the June elections;
and he won a landslide victory.
I hope these few facts and ideas
will make people want to deepen
their knowledge of our world. It can
only be to their benefit.
Yours sincerely,
Charles Twist, Biochem 1.
