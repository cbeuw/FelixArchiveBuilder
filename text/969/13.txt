the envy of less happier lands'.
More gaud than Gaunt. Whether
Shakespeare is entirely responsible
for the elevated egocentricity of the
English is perhaps a difficult claim
to qualify, but the proliferation of
the English language and the
English media across the world
makes a plausible basis for
considering our view of our status,
in contrast to the view of the U K
held by our international
contemporaries. And furthermore,
how do we assess British justice,
once proclaimed the envy of the
world, in the light of the Guildford
Four, the Birmingham Six, and
Judith Ward? The ghosts of
Timothy Evans and Derek Bentley
fail to raise their heads because their
necks were broken.
Civil unrest is, I suppose, the best
way to describe the Miners' Strike,
the Poll Tax riots, the Greenham
Common demonstration, et cetera.
We have paranoia theorists who are
only too keen to tell us of phone-
tapping, of MI5 and the armed
forces plotting a military coup
during the last Labour Government,
of spy rings at GCHQ, and of senior
Cabinet ministers involved in arms
deals with nations they subsequently
decide to send troops against. We
are constantly told by our
Government how much better than
others we are, in whatever issues
are effecting the comparison, but
'better than' does not mean 'good
enough'. I am reminded of the
politican disclaiming that
'Unemployment is no excuse for
joyriding or drug abuse' when it is
not being offered as an excuse, but
by way of explanation.
'Forty years, eh?'. Forty years.
'Not said much about her, have
you?' I have left that to my
illustrious colleague. 'Not very
balanced, then, is it?' The way I see
it, my evidence will counterbalance
your ego. ' A h , well. At least Sir
Edmund Hillary conquered Everest
for The Empire'. Not bad for a
New Zealander, especially with
such a dead weight.

What role does the Royal Family
play in Britain? Not the Monarchy,
which has a constitutional job of
work, but the Royals, the
Coronation Clan, the Grasping
Gathering. Are they merely the
British ambassadors to Klosters? A
monument to the flailing British
tourist industry? Lodging mates for
Michael Fagan? Possibly they are
all of these, but the predominant
role of the British Royal Family is
as escapism. We need our fun, our
Nazi Germany, continuing their
feigned reign. And when Britain
was at war with Germany,
Elizabeth did her bit as a jobbing
R A F mechanic. She also saw the
esteem of the Royals rising as her
mother visited London's East End
after Luftwaffe bombings.
After the war came a new
nationalistic fervour, stoked up by
the Festival of Britain. The Royal
Family turned the corner. National
mourning at the death of George
VI, national condemnation of the

diversions, something to look at and
shrug, 'maybe things aren't that bad
after all'. Come to one, all ye who
are burdened. Queenie, the
entertaining musical, at a Palace
near you.
At the time of the Coronation, the
press publishing funeral
photographs of a grieving mother,
wife and daughter, national joy
when the daughter became Queen
in her own right.
The Coronation was the start of
Entertainment UK, and the Queen
27 year old Queen was fully alive
to the importance of keeping the
Royals popular. She had witnessed
the trauma and tribulations when
Edward abdicated for Mrs
Simpson. She heard the grating of
teeth when the pretenders King
Edward and Queen Wallis visited
was its chief instigator. Against the
advice of the Prime Minister and
others, she allowed television
cameras into Westminster Abbey
for the Coronation ceremony.
Later, in 1969, the nation was
allowed a quick peak at the Royal
family life, with the veil drawn back
again by television. Last year, to
commemorate her 40 years on the
Throne, H M let cameras maraud all
over Balmoral to give us a year in
the life of One.
Some great, good and senile say
that this is when the rot set in. That
BBC documentary, showing Anne
talking through a stuffed mouthful
of sausage, detracted from the real
purpose of the Royals, represented
by the Caernarvon investiture of the
same year. But is the escapism not
fuelled by the heady mix of tradition
and modernity, encouraging a sense
of continuity when all is in flux?
She's always there, God luv 'er.
Not that she always seemed to be
there. The spotlight shifted from
time to time. Onto Princess Anne
and Captain Mark Phillips for the
Royal Wedding. Here's Prince
Charles and Lady Diana Spencer
for another Royal Wedding.
There's Prince Andrew and Sarah
Fergeson, you'll never guess, a
Royal Wedding. Back to the Duke
and Duchess for a Royal
Separation. Over the Prince and
Princess of Wales for another
separation. Joining us now is Anne
Windsor, with the Royal
Separation, divorce and re-
marriage. Behind the beaming smile
for the 1992 Royal Grampian
Wedding, did the Queen, baby-
sitter extraordinaire, reflect on her
entry to 20th century family life? So
many single parents.
Still, it was a nice wedding, in
time for Christmas, and smoking
out the memory of the Great
Windsor Toast-Out. Enough has
been written about the Annus,
suffice to add that if fire consumed
my house, I hope the taxman
wouldn't roll up with the fire
engine. There have been other fun
moments. Charles falling off his
polo horse. William getting a club
on the side of the head at school.
Some fool trying to kidnap Princess
Anne whilst driving up the Mall.
Diana's close encounters with the
china cabinet. Andrew's exploits in
the Falklands. Edward being Really
Useful. Philip, the slitty eyes, the
pot- bellied Hungarians, and the
Koala with mange. To top it all, the
aged relic Queen Mother chokes on
a bit of maggotted salmon. In
public, she's just in for observation.
In private, it's throat cancer.
Heaven help us when she dies.
What does one turn to for escapism
then?
