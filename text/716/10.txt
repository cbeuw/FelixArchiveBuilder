Earthquakes
Earthquakes are one of
the most destructive
natural hazards, both in
terms of loss of life and
damage to man-made
structures. The recent
earthquakes in Mexico
have demonstrated this
fact only too clearly, with
a death toll in the
thousands and large areas
of Mexico City left in
ruins. In the aftermath of
this catastrophe it is clear
that much or the
destruction could have
been avoided if buildings
had been more efficiently
designed and
constructed.
Since the turn of the
century more than 1.5
million people have been
killed as a result of
earthquakes, and the
damage has amounted to
more than Â£300,000
million. With the spread of
urban settlements and the
increased financial
investment in earthquake
regions of the world, the
toll has been steadily
rising. In recent years the
use of improved structural
design to try and
minimise this damage has
become one of the more
rapidly expanding
technologies.
Engineering Seismology
is an interdisciplinary
technology, that
combines our knowledge
of earthquakes, with
engineering in an attempt
to design new structures
more safely, and improve
the resistance of older
ones. Here at Imperial
College, in the Civil
Engineering Department,
there is an Engineering
Seismology Section
headed by Professor N
Ambraseys. The section
has around fifteen
postgraduate students of
which a high proportion
come from overseas, in
particular from countries
affected by earthquakes.
Earthquates are caused
when energy stored in the
earth's crust is suddenly
released. This energy
travels through the earth
in the form or seismic
waves, which are greatly
affected by the earth's
interior and the superficial
geology of an area. Local
topography, soil
conditions, and bedrock
formation can vary
considerably from one
area to another, and so
accurate predictions of
the form earth movments
might take is very
difficult. If purely
theoretical models are
used to assess the way
buidling materials and
foundations may respond
to future earth quakes,
then the results may not
be reliable. It is really
only through the field
study of earthquakes that
our understanding of their
complexity increases.
The Engineering
Seismology group base
their work on field
experience and send
representatives to visit the
site of major earthquakes,
damaged as a result of
earthquake activity they
need to be restored to
their original strength, not
just 'patched up'. Building
in areas that are known to
have poor foundations
should be avoided, and
high population densities
in danger areas can cause
problems. By visiting the
site of a destructive
earthquake it is possible
to see how all the
different factors influence
the extent of the damage.
The assessment of
Earthquake risk coupled
with attempts to mimimse
it is central to the group's
work. When determining
the risk, many factors
like the recent ones in
Mexico. The study of
earthquake damaged-
structures, such as those
shown in the
photographs, can give a
valuable insight into ways
of improving design and
construction. Although it
is virtually impossible to
design for zero damage,
the total collapse of
buildings can be avoided.
In the event of an
earthquake the large
amonts of energy that are
released have to be
absorbed somewhere. In a
badly designed buildling,
the weak points of a
structure will be identified
and total collapse of the
building can follow. The
group at Imperial College
take advantage of this fact
and use a 'Failsafe'
technique in their building
design in such a way that
if there is an earthquake
parts may fail, but the
main structure will remain
intact.
Inefficient design of
structures is only part of
the problem. The findings
of the group showed that
there are many other
steps that can be taken to
minimise risk. It is
important that
construction work is
carefully supervised to
ensure that finished
structures keep to the
original design
specifications. When
buildings become
have to be taken into
account; the natural
hazard of an area, the
vulnerability of a
structure, danger to life
and possible financial
loss, are all important.
The importance of each
factor varies considerably
depending on the area
you are looking at. For
instance, here in the
United Kingdom there is a
very low natrual hazard
and yet many structures,
because of their high
vulnerability, have a high
risk. In some areas of the
world, like Pakistan, the
financial factor is much
less signicant because the
cost of rebuilding
damaged structures is
quite Tow. Being able to
assess earthquake risk
accurately is particularly
important for insurance
companies.
Research carried out by
the Engineering
Seismology group is
providing a valuable
contribution in the search
for a fuller understanding
of the worldwide
earthquake problem.
Their findings are of geat
value. Here in the United
Kindgdom, which has
many hazardous
structures such as
bridges, dams and
chemical plants that must
be able to withstand
minor 'quakes'. Although
Earthquakes cannot be
prevented technological
developments give us the
power to minimise their
destructive potential.
