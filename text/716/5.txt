Rob Northey: The Interview
FELIX: How do you think
your first six months as
Refectory Manager have
gone?
Rob Northey: Not too badly
— could have been worse.
F: How do you think you
have developed the bars?
N: Well...that's a leading
question isn't it?
F: You've been accused of
ignoring the Union Bar. Do
you think you have
improved that bar?
N: It's my understanding
that the Union Bar had a
lot of money spent on it
recently and was very set in
its ways.
F: Brian and Doug have
complained that a lot of the
odd jobs that needed to be
done have been ignored?
N: I've taken Estates over
there to show them all the
jobs that needed doing
over there, not that long
ago.
F: Is it true that you weren't
happy with the
performance of the Brian
and Doug at the New Years
Party?
N: I felt that we needed
extra bar facilities to cut
down some of the queues.
F: Does that mean you felt
that the Union should have
run a can bar?.
N: A mobile bar or a can
bar or some other bar of
some description. Can bars
were run there in the past,
so the concept has already
been used over there, so I
was thinking of improving
facilities by breaking
queues down so that
people weren't all
condensed into one small
area.
F: Do you feel that given
the almost record takings
of the Union Bar during the
New Year's Party, that the
critcisms were unfair?
N: No, because we put on a
separate bar on the Friday,
and took a very similar
amount of money, despite
the boycott on the Union
Bar. The subsiduary bar,
serving just beer and cans
took over £750. Obviously
that sort of amount
indicates that it took the
pressure off the main bars.
F: Why did you ask Brian
and Doug to leave the
Union Bar on Tuesday after
they resigned.
N: It's fairly standard in the
trade that when people are
leaving very often you don't
expect them to work out
their notice. Not any
accusation against them its
just standard in the trade.
F: How succesful do you
feel the boycott has been?
N: I had no real doubt that
it would have a certain
impact. We will not see
whether it will have any
lasting impact because its
not been on for long
enough. It is counter-
productive as one hopes
that the bars will produce
good surpluses in the
future so that more work
can be done to improve
them. The money lost
during this week, and the
profit lost is going into
other pubs which will
obviously be deterimental
to the bars themselves. We
have large schemes for
Southside which we hope
to do out of the surpluses.
Obviously if we don't make
the surpluses we anticipate,
these will be curtailed.
Quite a lot of work has
already been started over
there.
F: A lot of people at the
UGM last Thursday felt that
beer was over-priced. You
have also been accused of
taking £20,000 from the
bars to support the
refectories. How much
money do you feel the bars
should make.
N: Policy decisions over the
financing of the bars and
refectories are not down to
me. They are down to the
Governors and the Rector
and the administration. I
obviously have not set the
trends. Any surpluses are
ploughed back into student
facilities, and I would like
to see a reasonable surplus
produced in the future, so
therefore the facilities can
be improved and possibly
be made into the finest
ones in London.
F: You mentioned
Southside. How would you
like to see Southside
improved.
N: I'd like to expand the
facilities offer better ranges
of food, perhaps better
wines, and then increase
comfort. A certain amount
of work needs doing over
there in the near future like
reflooring. I'd like to see a
more entertainment being
provided there. There are
many more—there's much
scope to provide better
facilities—not purely to
make more money,
because as I said I'd like to
anticipate that all the
surpluses are ploughed
back into student facilities;
not into College, which
never has been done, so,
you know, the scope is
unending. Obviously the
students will tell us in time
what they would like us to
do, and that's what we're
here to do; provide a
service for all the students.
F: Have you spoken to IC
President, Carl Burgess
about this recently?
N: All the improvements
have gone through the Bar
Committee and the Bar
Committee Chairman, like
all major policy decisions.
F:How do you feel about
Mr Burgess' conduct. Have
you any comments on the
way Mr Burgess is leading
the students...
(silence)
N:...Oh as far as Bar
Committees, the Vice
President is the Chairman
of our Committee, but Mr
Burgess has acted very
well, and he has ensured
that the protest has been
carried off peacefully, and
acted under his members'
wishes.
F: Would you oppose any
movement for the Union to
take over the bar?
N: That is not a decision
that I would make; that is
an administration decision.
I've been employed to run
the Union bar; if the
administration wishes to
hand it over to the
students, then it's up to
them.
F: How have you and your
staff reacted to the
situation in particular a lot
of abuse seems to have
been hurled in your
direction.
N: I think most of the abuse
is not acutually meant—the
majority of the people
mean it in a non-malicious
way, although there are
one or two people who
perhaps mean it in a
malicious way, and
basically we take it in the
spirit that very often it's
meant.
F: You said here..you said
that if you didn't improve
the situation in eighteen
months you'd leave. Is
there any temptation to
leave, given all the stick
you're having over the
current sitution?
N:l was warned about it
before I came, so therefore
the general trend is acting
true to form.
F: One of the rumours
going around about you is
that a near relative of yours
is about to be appointed
Union Bar manager. Would
your like to comment on
this?
N: Not a hope: I wouldn't
employ a relative.
F: Another accusation
that's going round is that-l
think we must have a
person a day dropping in at
the FELIX Office to ask us
this quesion-a different
person a day to tell us this
exclusive story-is that £200
was borrowed from petty
cash. Have you got any
comment on this story?
Without a receipt.
N: A load of codswallop.
F: Going on to the bar
prices increases. Why were
the increases put on, and
do you feel that they are
too large?
N: We're only following the
agreements with the Union
in February 1984. Infact the
margins are slightly less
than was proposed by the
Union at that stage. Some
of the drinks have actually
gone down since then,
despite two budget
increases. For instance, a
pint of Blackthorn,is now
62p and it was proposed to
be 62p in February '84.
Prior to February '84 it was
66 pence a pint. Fosters'
which was 72p prior to the
agreement, is now 66p and
it was 62p on the proposed
scheme, meaning that in
fact it hasn't increased in
cost apart from the budget
increases. Guinness has
risen, due to the cost of it,
but in two years its gone
from 66p to 74p, but prior
to the agreement it was
69p. Anymore?
F: Is Roger Pownell going
to be the new sort of 'super
bar manager' for the whole
college.
N: Super bar mangers have
been talked about for many
years here, no decision has
been reached at this time.
Whether Imperial College
has a bar manager over all
their bars will depend upon
the outcome of
negotiations with the Union
and many other areas.
F:Finally yourself, how do
you feel you've performed
over the first 6 months.
N: I said it would take 2
years to decide that.
F: Thank you.
