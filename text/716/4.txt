9 Potty
Time
Michael Bentine attracted a large and
appreciative audience when he spoke on 'The Art
of Creation' at the Wellsoc meeting in Mech Eng
220 on Monday evening. Best know for The Goon
Show and his television series Potty Time, Mr
Bentine displayed a broad knowledge of science
and a great appreciation of the creative abilities
of the human brain.
The central theme of Mr
Bentine's talk was that the
mind must be allowed to be
creative in order to
advanced the frontiers of
knowledge. He said that it
was too easy to allow one's
imagination and creativity
to be shifted by
rationalision. Men who had
made great advancements
in sc:
ence, he said, had
been able to raise their
level of thinking to the
supra-conscious' and so
find the inspiration to make
'Quantum leap'
advancements. He
compared this mode of
thought to that of a child
where imagination was not
hindered by the
accumulation of 'rational'
knowledge.
Mr Bentine also
discussed what factors
influenced the state of
mind and the ability to
think imaginatively. Herzian
frequencies, such as in
pieces of music, he said,
could be both helpful and
detrimental to creative
thought. He cited the
sinister example of the
Nuremberg Rally as a core
of a 'creative destructive
force' which had
manipulated people to hate.
Mr Bentine said that very
little was known about the
workings of the human
mind, and spoke of his
experiences of the
paranormal (or, as the
stressed, the 'normal'). In a
similar way, few people
appreciated the full extent
of their imaginative powers,
he conducted by
encouraging his listeners to
pursue a creative course
throughout their careers; to
'dream the impossible
dream'.
The talk was followed by
a raffle of which raised
£143 for Save the Children.
Mr Bentine was thanked by
Professor Eric Laithwaite
and Wellsoc committee
member Michael Newman.
Imperial College students raised around £3000 for
children's charities when they took part In the traditional
Tlddlywlnklng Rag event on Saturday.
Guilds raised £1385 and were the most successful of the
CCU teams. Top collector was Robin Andrew of Civ Eng
2. RCS raised £1034 Eleanor Malcolm of Maths 3 raised

Look
Sharp
All students who do not
pay their hall bills on time
will face a surcharge of
£15. Student Services have
confirmed that this amount
will be added to all invoices
not settled by Thursday 17
October.
Any students who will
not be able to pay by this
date should see Lesley
Gillingham in the Student
Services Office (15, Princes
Gardens) and fill in a late
payment form to avoid the
surcharges.
Blue
Joke
A fake newsletter,
supposedly representing a
politically far-right College
society was received by
many members of the
Computing Department on
Wednesday. The 'Imperial
College British Society'
newsletter expressed views
which many students found
offensive. The circular gave
a fictional list of future
events, including a speaker
meeting with Patrick
Harrington, an ex-student
of the Polytechnic of North
London who was much in
the news last year because
of his connections with the
National Front. The
'Society' claimed to have
invited MP Enoch Powell to
speak at IC about his views
on repatriation.
Union president Carl
Burgess is making
enquiries into the orgins of
the bogus letter. He said
that the authors would be
in serious trouble if their
identity was discovered.
Come to
the
Cabaret
A good time was had by all
(or at least those who
turned up) at the Ents
comedy night, held on
Tuesday in the Union
Lounge. Compere Arthur
Smith introduced John
Sparks, who followed his
'drunken' piece with a
hilarious ventriloquist act,
making excellent use of a
brick and a pedal bin. In
the next act, Steve Kolgar
gave some side-spliting
hints on survival for
students.
Ents are hoping for a
better turnout next week
(Tuesday 15) when the
evening will be compered
by John Hegley.
