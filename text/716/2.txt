happened to another
society the President spoke
sharply and angerily to a
UGM about the need to
respect the posters of
societies in College. If
people continue to take
down our posters it will get
out of hand and I would
like you to do something
about it now.
Thank you
yours sincerely

Dear Sir,
Thank you for publishing
that delightful piece of
prose from Michael
Newman last week. I'm glad
to see that Michael's
eloquence and intelligence
have not been dimmed by
his recent 'absence' from
the College scene.
I am sure that all this years
Freshmen will have been
impressed by Michael
Newmans concern over
Human Rights, Nuclear and
Biological Warfare and
sexism which is no doubt
the first offensive in his
'Winter Campaign' for
morality which those of us
who have been at IC for
some time have been
subjected to several times
before. I wonder how long
after the publication of his
article it will be before the
first U G M motion on these
issues appears?
I would just like to point
out to all the people who
are not familiar with such
'classic IC debates' that
they consider and Analyse
very carefully what Michael
Newman has to say before
coming to any conclusion
about just how righteous
he really is. As an example,
Mister Newman is on
written record in a past
issue of FELIX that he
counts himself as one of
those members of the
population who
masturbates over
pornographic magazines.
When I read that sort of
hypocrisy I wonder how
sincere he is about the
other issues he raises.
I am looking forward to
some entertaining UGM's.
Yours sincerely

Life Sci Dies?
Dear Sir,
The Life Science Party has
become a traditional part of
freshers week. It is always
widely attended by a large
number of students in the
hope that they will be able
to benefit from a party with
a better mix of the sexes.
On Tuesday evening
around 11.30pm whilst
walking along the walkway
I came across a number of
people coming away from
the party obviously rather
unhappy with the evenings
entertainment.
I went along to see what
was happening. I was
horrified to find out what
the Life Science party
consisted of. The amount
of organisation that had
gone into the party was
minimal. The disco was the
worst, I've ever seen. Poor
sound quality and
continuous 'alternative'
music without much variety
didn't make dancing very
easy. Some effort had been
made to create some
atmosphere by having four
spot lights on the ceiling.
This was beautifully
complemented by eight
flashing coloured lights to
really finish off the affect.
No expense spared!
Then of course a cash
bar which closed promply
at 11.00pm without anyone
realising it. All this
provided for £2 a head.
On a very rough
calculation these were
probably 300 people
attending bringing in £600.
If the disco and lights had
cost £50 it would have been
extortionate. This still gives
a clear profit of £500
allowing for another £50 for
misc expenses.
It cannot be right for a
group of students to make
so much money from an
event that they do not take
trouble to organise
properly.
I suggest that in future
years, the Life Science
party is not promoted as a
freshers week events.

FSLN vs FCS
Sir,
Forgive me for returning
once more to a subject
upon which I am already a
notorious bore; that of
Nicaragua. Many students
will have seen at Freshers'
Fair a poster on the
Conservative Society stall
reading 'Support the
Contras with FCS', a poster
which popular objections
later induced them to
cover. Lest the support of a
major political party should
lend respectability to their
cause, let's be clear about
the contras: These guerrilla
organisations are
attempting the armed
overthrow of a popular and
democratically-elected
government. The elections
of November 1984 which
returned the Sandinista
Front to power were the
most freely-conducted ever
seen in Nicaragua, and
were approved by an all-
party group of British MP'S
and Lords, including the
Conservative David Ashby.
The Tory government,
however, which chose not
to send its own official
observers, have decided in
advance that the elections
would be a 'Soviet-style
sham' (Reagan's words),
now claims to know
enough about those
elections to support
violence overthrow of th
resulting authorities in
Poster Protest
Dear Carl,
This is an official , written
complaint. Firstly I wish to
complain about the
tasteless, insulting and
offending posters IC
Conservative Society
desplayed at their Fresher's
Fair stall. Thses included
one that said 'Hiroshima
was a nuclear free zone',
another supported the
Contras, others deprected
Arthur Scargill as a fascist,
Ken Livingstone as a
terrorist and compared
socialism with fascism. As
a socialist and peace
campaigner I find these
grossly insulting, and
appear to be aimed simply
to incite anger and
violence. They do not put
over Consoc's political
aims or views, then simply
insult and smear their
opponents. If these posters
were against a particular
religion, or race, or sex I
am sure you and your
favour of a return of the
late dictator Somoza's
private army.
Bearing in mind the
brave words of Mrs
Thatcher regarding
terrorists, which the
Contras are, and her
reluctance even to deny
trade to the murderous
regime in South Africa,
how can Conservative
support for the Contras be
consistent with government
policy, let alone justified?.
Suffice it to say that even
the Tories are somewhat
shamefaced about the
matters: knowing that it
would be publicly
unacceptable openly to
block aid to Nicaragua,
they sought to 'delay' it on
technicalities, as a leak to
the Guardian revealed.
Even the FCS Death-and
Glory boys at Freshers' Fair
quibbled when challenged,
saying that IC Consoc has
no policy of its own
regarding Nicaragua..
Yours (in full flow)
Peter Hobbis
Chair, IC Soc Soc
Exec would act. I am
asking you to treat this
matter the same . To
reprimand Consoc and not
to allow them to put any of
the offending posters up
around College. If you
require to be 'picketed'
into action I can collect
twenty signatures of
protest. I might add that no
other political stall,
including CND displayed
any insulting or tasteless
posters.
My second complaint is
that during the Tuesday of
Fresher Fair someone took
down all ICCND's posters
along the walkway, by
Mech Eng and in Sherfield.
These were not offensive,
simply advertising our stall
and had a picture of a
skeleton reading 'protest
and survive', the slogan
being 'don't you wish you
were better informed'. Our
posters were selectively
taken down, others being
left. This is a very serious
matter to us, as we depend
upon our publicity posters
and pay for them, apart
from the effort to put them
up. Last year when this
