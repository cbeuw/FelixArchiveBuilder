Welcome once more to the
world where you can use
your brain and pen-power
in pursuits other than
pushing back the frontiers
of Science. Obviously our
last task was much too
ambitious, so this week
we'll make it very easy, but
still keeping rhyme. Choose
from any or all, of the
following, but keep the
subject matter to London
or IC.
a) Lyrics. Song writing is
difficult, but it's quite easy
to take the tune of well-
known song and fit your
own words to suit. This is
exampled in an episode of
The Phil Silvers Show when
Sgt Bilko writes a song for
his new draftee (Elvis
Palvin) entitled Brown
suede Combat Boots and is
also how some of the
popular College Bar Night
songs arose! My favourite
contemporary examples are
Ballad of John Parkes and
a rip-off of the Mac
Donalds commercial tune,
which we will print with
authors permission (and
censorship allowing) next
time.
b)Riddles. A favourite
with children, whose jokes
tend to be along the line of
a question followed by an
answer, which is a crude
form of the riddle-class
riddles and Nursery rhymes
popular in the Victorian
Era. I picked this one out of
The Dandy many years
ago...
What's the start of eternity,
The end of time and Space,
The beginning of every end
And end of every place?
Think about it.
c) Limericks. Now
normally associated with
bawdy lines and Bog Wall
humour, but is a serious
and well-documented
poetry-form which is easy
to write. No examples are
needed, and the most
topical ones recieved will
be printed here or saved for
the next Rag Mag!
Again a £10 for the best
contribution to the FELIX
office by Monday 14
October.
See you in seven days
when all those new to
London get their chance to
be a real-life Cockney and
the promised Song words
are unveiled.
