The Belt
Professor Eric Ash, the new
Rector, is proving to be
somewhat enigmatic.
Members of the academic
staff are particularly
concerned. One elderly
academic, who has seen
many a Rector come and
go in his time, reported that
Ash was 'earnest and
sincere — and we're all
very worried about if.
John Smith, Turf
Accountant
Perhaps College Secretary,
John Smith, should also be
worried. Mr Smith's
reputation is that of a
devious administrator,
quietly getting his own way
with no visible sign of
blood except when the odd
Estates offical gets exiled
to Silwood Park. He may
find it rather more difficult
to cope with earnestness
and sincerity and return to
the Foreign Office, where
such qualities are not
found in abundance.
John Smith's
qualifications for a job in
the FO spring from as
Governor of the Gilbert and
Ellis Islands. He had the
difficult task of ensuring
the economic success of
the Colony but proved up
to the task, ensuring that
income from one-armed
bandits kept the place
afloat. Perhaps a job as a
'turf accountant' lies ahead;
with people like the Union's
administrator, Jen Hardy-
Smith, losing some of their
hard-earned pennies on the
gee-gees every Wednesday
he would have no difficulty
in living in the style to
which he has become
accustommed.
John Smith will, no
doubt, be here for
considerably longer than
ICU Prseident, Carl
Burgess. The most
convincing sign of his
impending demise is the
fact that a motion of
censure can be passed
despite being proposed by
megabore J Martin Taylor.
Mr Taylor is a failed
presidential candidate
himself (he received fewer
votes than the joke
candidate, who won the
election in this instance)
way back in 1982. Martin's
monotonous Lancastrian
drawl and extreme right-
wing views are normally
quite enough to lose him
any vote but Carl's
blunderings were just too
much for even Martin to
manage to disguise. Can
Carl save himself with a
last charge on the Sherfield
building and kill the
snorting dragon, in the
form of Refectory Manager
Rob Northey? I suspect
that there are a few trip-
wires awaiting Carl before
he can get his hands on the
Union Bar and improve his
chances of survival.
