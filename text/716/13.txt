SF
The tube train rattled
noisily through Brompton
Road tube station while the
death throes of the world
still echoed in my ears. We
had been got at. Some
bastard had switched the
third reel, and God Truth
and the American Way had
not truimphed. Instead the
manic machine had
launched an attack on
Russia.
Well that film wasn't
Wargames, which we all
enjoy last Tuesday. As this
piece of literary
incompetence
spontaneously reproduces
from my pen arrangements
will be under way for the
resit SF Soc film.
Unfortunately, since
decisions will be made in
two days time (yesterday to
you) details cannot be
revealed. Suffice it to say
that anybody who came to
the library meeting will
have seen SF Soc decision
making (argument) in full
swing. Details will reach
you as soon as I know
them.
Meanwhile, you canwhile
away the hours 'till the resit
film by reading books form
our 1000 book
library—open each
Thursday at 1pm in the
green Committee Room.
Who knows what else
might happen at these
meetings? Come along and
find out.

Hockey
After receiving an invitation
earlier on in the year a
team of first, second and
third XI players converged
on London over the
summer for a weekend
tournament in Holland.
Despite loosing the odd
sleeping bag on the
motorway the journey to
Ternkursen was uneventful,
ending up with some fine
international
cuisine?—Chinese, (seeing
that everywhere else was
closed).
The Saturday started
uncharacteristically with a
first minute goal for
IC—could this winning
>treak at last? Yes and No
we won two and lost two
and finished second in the
group. However it was not
till the Saturday night that
the team really
showed—Most notable that
the being Duncan and
Nigel for their remarkable
jazz dancing with half of
the ladies teams present.
The following morning
started with stiff legs, sore
head and exagerated
stories—all of which
showed in the Hockey and
before long we were
looking for extra players,
whilst the local Doctor
made running repairs with
needle and thread to Chris
and Nigel's eyebrows.
The tournamant ended
with the team 9th out of
16th not too bad after
playing 8 matches and the
only mixed game of the
tournaments!
Unfortuantely the writer
can not give a full report of
the return journey, espec-
ially the boat trip but by all
accounts the team was a
great success and should
become a regular summer
event for the Hockey club.
Many thanks to Rolf for
his hard work in organising
the tournament.
Sailing
Imperial College Sailing
Club is one of the top
university clubs in the
country. We compete in a
wide variety of tournments
and manage to win quite a
few. Last year we visited
such exotic places as
Holland, Ireland and
Bradford.
For the Lesser Yellow
Wellies there's plenty of
entrance to Southside
Refectory (where all the
details were given) and you
can have a wonderful
afternoon sailing.
Chaplaincy
Fight World Poverty
On Tuesday October 22
there will be a mass lobby
on the House of Commons.
The event is organised by
the major development
agencies and churches. Its
purpose will be to urge the
Government to give much
more support to the Third
World.
Speakers include Neil
Kinnock, David Steel and
Timothy Rainson. Tickets
are £1 and can be obtained
from the Chaplaincy, 10
Princes Gardens. A party
will be leaving Beit Arch at
1.15pm.
Everyone in this country
benefits from the use of
child labour in plantations
and mines in South
America from cheap tea
and coffee, from white rule
in South Africa, there is no
avoiding this.
Faced with such issues it
is difficult to know what to
do. Events such as this
mass lobby are very
important. They are a sign
that people do care. The
mass slaughter in Ethiopia
is an act of man not an act
of God. It is about narrow
minded western
government allowing whole
nation to collapse for the
sake of short term interests.
In a democratic country the
opportunity to mess about
and learn on Wednesday
afternoon's at the Welsh
Harp Reservoir. There
we've got^eight Firefly
dinghies plus an excellent
club-house which we share
with other colleges. There's
a cheap bar selling beer etc
plus a kitchen providing
food to hungry sailors.
For those who would like
to try the sport then come
along on Wednesday. Just
sign the notice next to the
governement is the people
and we allow this to
happen then we are to
blame.

two epic adventures of the

your bikes here yet you can
still come to our meetings
in the Southside Lounge on
Thursdays at 12.30pm to let
us know what you want
from the cycling club and
to find out what we are
planning to do in the future
(details of which are posted

board).
Our first ride on
Wednesday, went round
Richmond Park, which is a
fairly enormous expanse of
grass trees and furry
creatures large and small).
On Sunday we went to
Mac Donalds in Windsor
(we also called at the castle
just to say hi to
everyobody) Though
slightly windier than
preferred we all stuck
together and a good time
was had by all.

to seeing you on our rides
or at our meetings.
