monocoque and other
structural elements. The
seat mountings will
probably be part of the
integral structure and,
bearing in mind the forces
transmitted through, and
from, the rider, this will be
a critical area to stop him
accidentally pulling the
monocoque apart around
him. Also, the wings might
have to be hollow to take
break cables and con-rods
and attaching the wings to
the main body will take
great thought, since they
have to take large bending
moments from turning.
Furthermore, internal
aluminium torsion boxes
will have to be designed
because the monocoque
cannot close over the rider
where he needs a clear
canopy.
3) Aerodynamics of the
vehicle. As I have just
alluded, the monocoque
does not constitute the
entire exterior. Light
weight, single web G R P
skins will form quite a lot of
the aerodynamic surface of
the vehicle, especially at
the nose and tail where the
honeycomb reinforcement
is incapable of being
curved in two planes,
anyway. One effect which
determines the mimimum
wheelbase, is to avoid
interference drag between
the wheel nacelles and the
riders compartment.
4) Overall mechanics; eg
steering-design joysticks
and con-rods, front wheel
mounting castings, king pin
orientation and wheelbase
geometry (the last two
being critical as far as
steering characteristics and
roll resistance are
concerned). Also the chain-
system-bearings for the
cranks, wheels etc and
their setting into the
monocoque, facilities for as
large a gear range as
possible (eg maybe a new
front changer design to
cope with derailing the
chain between designs of
vastly varied diameter, an
extra chain tensioner apart
from a standard rear
derailer cage.)
Our object is to build a
machine where each part is
designed to mesh exactly
with the whole, as opposed
to a vehicle where each
area is a separate design
experiment, all lashed
together to give the
finished product (with such
trundling autistics, disaster
is a frequent and costly
bedfellow-ask Cranfield
Technical College).
Hopefully we should be
able to start construction of
the new machine next
mm
U
summer, and to smoothe
the way to this goal, the
club is well connected, via
the auspices of the BHPC
to an enormous welter of
other designers practical
experience and to suppliers
of suitable metals, plastics,
composites and
components.
Finally , to spur any
flagging interests, I should
draw your collective
attention to some of the
less than altruistic rewards
for such endeavours, to
name but a few—the
Dupont flat speed prize
($100,000); the practical
HPV competition (last year
£10,000); the sponsors for
Milton Keynes, who it
seems are willing to
sponsor further events, put
up £8,000 this time and I
think we should go and
reap our own due share.
And for you incipient media
mega-stars out in FELIX
Land the TV press and
radio Harpies are becoming
ever more eager to lap HPV
Leavings.
Whatever your angle, be
it athletic, engineering or
just a perverse desire to
laugh at other peole We'd
love to have a natter with
you, especially if you might
be interested in doing one
of the projects in a relevant
department. If that is your
inclination then contact us
via the pigeon holes in the
C&G Union office or write
to Rupert Hart ME PG or
Mathew Colebourne DoC 3
through internal mail.
