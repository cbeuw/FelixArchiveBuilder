Spelling Mistak
Dear Sir,
It is a popular myth that
scientists cannot spell, and
it must be said that your
organ does little to set the
matter to rights but I was
particuarly moved to write
to after seeing the entry in
the freshers' FELIX
concerning Film Night on
Thursday 3 October. While
I must agree with your
critic that any film with the
star of Tess in it is worth
going to see, I must point
out that the young lady's
name is Nastassja Kinski
and not Natasha, Nastassia
or any other such similar
approximation, I can assure
you that I have this
information on the very
best possible authority!
Yours etc

Dear Sir,
With regard to the article
entitled 'Boat Bonanza' in
the Frshers edition, I
noticed an error of some
five thousand pounds, the
article stated that the ne
eight for the Boat Club
would cost the union aboui
eight thousand pounds. In
fact, after the Boat Club
won the Visitors' Challenge
Cup at Henley Royal
Regatta, an event open to
any academic institution in
the world, produced the
fastest novice eight in the
country, and finished the
season with a record fifty
victories (three times that
of any other university or
college boat club), College
offered to buy a much
needed eight in
conjunction with the Union.
The sum paid by the Union
was three thousand
^nds, not eight, and
college settled the rest of
me five and a half thousand
pound bill.
Having set the record
straight, I would like to add
that this year Imperial
College's reputation in the
rowing world has attracted
the sort of oarsmen which
could make the club the
most sucessful rowing club
in the Country. This would
not be possible without this
new eight, which we at the
Boat Club are very grateful
for.
Yours faithfully

Union Bar
Firstly let me congratulate
Carl Burgess on apparently
getting College in a
position where they are
prepared to negoitiate
about giving students
control of The Union Bar.
One has to ask, though,
whether this is the time for
the Union to take control of
the bar. Apparently the
Union are being offered the
bar in exchange for the
Lounge. The Lounge is
argueably the best venue
for parties in College. The
only problem with it is that
it is rather small. In
addition the Union has
been arguing for years that
the north side of Beit
should be Union controlled.
To give up part of the north
side would be a bad
mistakes. The Life Sciences
Division has been keen to
take over parts of the
Union for years. If they
were given the Lounge they
would try to claim other
parts of the Union.
If College eventually offer
the Union the Union Bar
without any conditions
attached, it must think
carefully before deciding to
run the Bar. Nobody in the
Union has given much
thought to how the Union
would then manage its
trading outlets. The Union
would almost certainly
need a full time Trading
Manager. This would cost
the Union £10,000 a year.
This would be in addition
to a Bar Manager and a
Catering Manager. The
management structure
would need to be changed
in other ways. Basically we
would have to become
more professional. The
Union is capable of running
a bar. It just needs to think
about it how it should run
the Bar.
