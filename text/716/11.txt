The metaphor of food in 'Dim
Sum—a little Piece of Heart'
(Screen on the Hill) extends
not only throughout the film,
but seemingly into the
names of people involved in
the makng of it too, with two
Chews (acting) and a Seltzer
(Screenplay).
The story concerns the
relationship between three
Chinese Americans,
mother, daughter and uncle
and also between the two
cultures. The uncle are
daughter are 'similar
casualties' of this culture
clash and are far more
westernised then the
mother, who wishes for
little more then to see the
marriage of her daughter.
Her haste in this desire is
prompted by a fortune
teller's prediction of her
imminent death at the age
of 62.
The use of approriately
static camera work and
nice little ironies, such as
the 'potato chip' in amongst
the mah jong set and the
baseball commentary over
shots of Chinese
ornaments, adequately
demonstrate the director,
Wayne Wang's skill in story
telling. All in all it's a very
refreshing change from the
usual Hollywood
McDonalds.
If further incentive were
required there is an
interesting entree in the
form of 'Koclo: Heartbeat
Dummers of Japan' which
affords the rare opportunity
to see a group of people
determinedly attempting to
bludgeon the crap out of
barrels with the aid of
Indian clubs. Remarkable.
Nightmare on Elm Street,
on the other hand, is
neither delightful, amusing
or highly recommended. It
is written and directed by
philosophy lecturer Wes
reviews
to the front in the
Odeon/Empire etc and
you'll get a real pain in the
neck.
The Barbican is showing
Insignificance (a film which
should really mean
something to IC Students
since its main characters
are Marilyn Monroe and
Albert Einstein) until 10th
October and then Pale
Rider from the 11th to 17th,
after which it switches to a

Jon Coupe on the pros and cons of alcohol-free cinema.
Craven and tells the tale of
a group of kids attacked,
usually fatally, in their
dreams. The idea itself is
clever enough, but
unfortunately is so badly
handled that the suspense
is diffuse, adding a certain
irony to the heroine's
advice 'don't fall asleep'.
Stick to the day job, Wes.
A forty pence tube ride on
the Circle Line can take
you to a very different sort
of cinema at the Barbican
Centre. Very different in the
type of film it shows, no;
different in price and
comfort, yes.
The Barbican is one of
London's biggest
independant cinemas.
Most of its rivals run an
aggressive programme of
art movies and cult films
but the Barbican seems to
have lost its nerve and has
switched to showing more
popular films, albeit only
those with some claim to
intellectual respectability.
Recent films have included
Wetherby and The
Shooting Party. Pale Rider
is coming later this month.
With such an
unexceptional choice of
films, normally showing
after they have finished at
Leicester Square, the
Barbican sounds like a very
good place to avoid — and
would be, if not for its
students discount scheme
(operating about ten to
fifteen minutes before the
start of a film and reducing
the cost of a ticket from £3
to £2) and the cinema's
comparative luxury.
Inside the theatre there is
air conditioning, thick
carpet and enormous
armchairs, instead of tatty
folding seats. Sound and
vision quality are superb
and the screen is
comfortably watchable
from any seat (sit too close
bewildering succession of
Walt Disney movies and
'five versions of Carmen by
five noted directors'.
So long as the Barbican is
showing a film you want to
see then its the place to
see it.

John Burgess looks at the last of the Fringe.
One of the largest tragedies
of this year's Edinburgh
Festival was the failure of
The Scotsman to award
Scream Blue Murder a well
deserved Fringe First.
Instead, these three foot
success symbols were
awarded to the usual gamut
of large professional
companies with only the
odd notable exception,
(such as Red Rose
Theatre's extraordinary
Beatrix and Sigmund).
Forunately this did little to
deter their more discerning
audiences, much to their
delight and the doubtless
consternation of the
Assembly Rooms,
Edinburgh's most
successful venture since
Greyfriars Bobby.
Now The Shadow
Syndicate have taken their
non-award winning play to
the Gate Theatre, Notting
Hill. A radical adaptation of
Emile Zola's Therese
Racquin, the play traces
the events surrounding the
murder of her husband, by
her lover and he/seif, and
how her guilt leads to the
destruction of everything in
her limited world.
The script and the
production are quite
fantastic. Using quite
remarkable theatrical
techniques, the play moves
with almost cinematic
precision, using the
combination of cabaret and
powerful choreography to
enhance its effect.These
superb experiments do not
marr the production in any
way, but complements the
actoin perfectly, flowing in
a way rarely seen in most
'modern adaptations' today.
Although not, in my view.
a comparable candidate for
The Scotsman's coveted
award, John Tordoff's
production of Reynard The
Fox at The Young Vic
captures the crisp
atmosphere of Masefield's
epic poem with similar
aptitude. The poem is so
neatly cleft into two parts
that is seems almost tailor-
made for adaptation.
However, despite their
burning perserverance, the
cast of five have some
difficulty in proving their
dedication convincing until
well into the second act.
Often lack of action and
ideas threaten to bring the
tension, brilliantly built up,
to an anti-climatic end.
Despite this, John
Tordoff gives an energetic
performance as Reynard,
holding the suspense of the
tale (tail?) to the very end.
