Brixton
Over the past months, street riots have become a
frequent occurence in this country. But few people
have yet to be caught in one. For those uninitiated,
Andrew Vickers describes the scene in Brixton two
weeks ago.
Picture the scene—a fourth
year classroom, the teacher
standing behind a desk,
frantically calling for the
return of order to the
crowd of unruly school
children. Picture the
problems she has been
faced with, the child who
took offence at being
ticked off for not doing his
homework, the friends who
support their classmate by
yelling at their tutor and
then the rest of the kids
who can sense the
ingredients of disorder
being poured into the
melting pot. Picture the
lout who lights the fire by
flicking the first elastic
band and watch the whole
mess erupt in a frenzied
boil—a riot.
Remember school riots?
Remember the
apprehensive excitment
you felt as everyone around
you was pushing a
normally well ordered
environment into chaos?
(Of course you didn't
participate). Weren't these
events part of the spice of
school life? Part of your
Education and a warning
for your future?
Now expand the
scenario. As a venue, take
the streets, replace the
teacher with an even more
authoritarian body—the Old
Bill. The aggrieved school
child becomes an enraged
member of the community.
The friends are her friends
and relatives, and the rest
of the class becomes the
rest of the community.
Throw in a Smith and
Wesson 38 revolver and
what have your got? You
guessed it—a riot— but
now you're in Brixton and
in grave danger.
You've heard it on the
radio, you've seen it on
television, you might even
have read it in the
newspapers, but for most
Londoners Brixton and the
disturbances of the 28th
September are unreal. They
did not experience it
themselves. And they do
not know what it was really
like to be caught in the
worst example of violence
on the streets of London
since April 1981.
Four friends and I had
planned to meet at Brixton
tube station at 6.30 that
evening before venturing
into the glittering streets of
Streatham for a night of
fun. Imagine the shock the
two of us felt as we walked
right into the
mugging—eight West
Indian men were attacking
an Asian shopkeeper. After
several rowdy seconds of
intimidation they hurried
away, leaving their victims
clothes tattered and blood
stained. He was lucky, he
was not seriously hurt. Still
reeling from this encounter,
we walked on to Brixton
Road to see a squad of riot
police keeping their
distance from a raging
crowd. The main road was
teeming with people trying
to see what was happening.
I caught a glimpse of a half
brick streaking though the
air before spotting Steve,
one of my other friends,
outside the tube station.
as we waikea tne iuu yaras
stretch, 2 or of about 10
white faces amongst
hundreds of black ones, we
felt fear in every step, the
trick was to look
unconcerned and
purposeful. One damning
stare, one wrong word or
simply just the look of fear
could make the next gang
set upon us. It took three
minitues to cover the
distance and in that the
time we saw shops looted,
petrol bombs thrown, and
one man stabbed.
Our next encounter was
Railton Road, the 'frontline'
of the '81 riots, now flowing
with escaping looters
eager to get home with the
spoils of their rampage.
After minutes of nervous
debate, we decided to head
for Coldharbour Lane and
likely trouble spots rather
than delay our return to the
flat and refuge. There we
witnessed more arson. Half
way down this road we had
Once inside the foyer, we
heard that all incoming
trains were terminating at
Stockwell. Steve left us to
try and find his girlfriend
there and the doors were
locked to the keep the
looters out. The
apprehension in this place
was almost physical. How
safe were we? How safe
was our flat-mate? She had
stayed behind and was all
on her own in the flat.We
'phoned her to say we
would try to get back.
There is a stretch of
Brixton Road between the
tube station and the Town
Hall that is normally alive
with shoppers and people
enjoying the sunny, friendly
atmophere. That evening,
to stop as countless West
Indians ran across the road
, pulled down a metal grille,
smashed a window and
made off with entire
contents of an electrical
shop before a van load of
riot police drove around the
corner. A corner on which
a furniture shop and four
flats stood. Hours later that
corner was a smouldering
heap of rubble.
Barrington Road meant
relative safety, entering our
flat was a blessed relief.
The same relief was felt
by my other flatmate. He
got off the tube at
Stockwell station and
walked straight into the
battle. He then took great
care to avoid anymore
trouble by walking to our
flat via Streatham, Tulse
Hill and Heme Hill. He
eventually arrived at
Loughborough Junction to
find riot police on one side
of him and the mob on the
other, Legging if came
very easily to him as the
petrol bombs started to fall.
In the tenth floor
sanctuary that is number 49
we were able to look on the
disaster strewn streets of
Brixton in stunned
disbelief, a disbelief
eclipsed by the horrifying
reality of what we had
seen.

What drives the minds of
the people involved in the
unrepentant criminality that
was evident that night, and
to a lesser degree on the
following nights? Who
caused it? Michael Grooce,
Inspector Douglas
Lovecock, the Do Gooders
of the local community, the
whole community, Margaret
Thatcher or the
communists. And why the
hell do store keepers and
innocent bystanders need
to suffer for the mistakes
and failings of people with
whom they have no
concern?
Let us see Brixton as a
thriving inner city area
once again and soon!
PS Poor old Ernie Harris has
had several offers of a new
piano to replace the one
burnt in his gutted flat.
