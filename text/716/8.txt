The Bicycle—humble foot-
servant of the people,
rolling anachronism and
available in its current form
since the turn of the
century, its timeless profile
bound and locked in the
sacred tombs of the Union
Internationale de Cyclistes.
Any new variant is stifled at
birth—need I mention the
Olympics and the solid
wheel? For competitive
comparision, I concede, a
necessary evil, but for the
commuter keeping up with
the age of the track-suit
and Sony Walkman,
requiring of his trusty
velocipede a modicum of
speed and safety keeping
him and his baggage dry
and warm, not so good.
Progress, desert us not in
our time of need! Beware,
oh stalwart Bike, your days
are numbered for, lo, the
advent of the Human
powered Veicle (HPV) is
nigh!
HPV? Almost anything
with a MacDonald's fueled
engine, in the air, on land
and water, but which
endeavours to use modern
techniques and
understanding to the
machines utmost
advantage, on land such
vehicles capitalise on vastly
superior aerodynamics; first
place your
rider/pilot/engine/mug so
as to present the minimal
frontal area, usually well
reclined or occasionally flat
on his chest (recumbent or
prone to the
jargonmongering
cogniscenti), then mix in
painfully coloured fairing to
taste, et voila—HPV.
We have one such loyal
i steed—the Windcheetah. I
had best rattle off a brief
spec':-
Windcheetah MklllA s1;
Recumbent tricycle, two
" front wheels, main
breaking power in paired
hub-breaks; low -slung
bucket seat and joystick
control, chain-rings and
cranks out front; 24 " rear
driven wheel with 46 " to
120 " gearing.
I might say that the
above is by no means the
undisputed, ideal solution
and that diversity seems to
be the designers prevailing
watch-word. To site a few
classics:-
Recumbent bicyles—the
Bean and Bluebell, the
latter and recent world
record holder at about 56
mph; variants on our own
theme, notably, the aquiline
Vector and its
dopplegangers; Jouta's
powered front wheel and
steered rear wheels which
lean the rider into the
corners; recumbent,
tandem tricycles, the
sleekest exponent of three
being Dark Horse—the
variants are practically
limitless.
C&G HPV club, itself, is
just in its formative stages
having only recently sprung
from the mightly loins of
the Oddysian charity
venture Pedal GB '83,
wherein our Herculean
adventurers pedaled the
Windcheetah around the
3,675 miles of the entire
British costline in 10 and a
half days amassing £4,600
for the RNLI. In those
heady days the
Windcheetah inhabited a
less than graceful, Kevlar
bodyshell carrying the
uninspiring handle of the
'Animated Bathtub', so
christened in
acknowledgement of its,
frankly ungainly
countenance, still it did the
job; countless inquisitive
coppers stopped us to be
struck dumb by its total
lack of an engine and its
quite a sight to see it
pulling away from a Transit
doing 65.
After this, in a bid to
nurture the sappling club,
we affiliated to the British
Human Powered Club
(BHPC). This
agglomeration of back-
street boffins and budding
enthusiasts sets out to foist
the word of the human
powered activist (well aren't
we all) on the
unenlightened ear of Joe H
Public, to seek out
empathic sponsors and to
unite other like-minded
visionaries of human power
in all the disciplines. They
also organise competative
events which we frequently
attend, the most recent of
these being the Festival of
Human Power at Milton
Keynes. This gathering of
the clans had a distinctly
international flavour
boasting nearly 200
entrants and we
materialised sporting our
new, vicious violet
bodyshell. In predictably
lousy weather, on an uphill
sprint section, we clocked
an awesome 39.2mph, a
meager 4mph beind
Bluebell, augering well for
a top speed of around
50mph on the flat with less
harrassment from the
elements. Thus we, up until
now a self-confessed joke
team in our 'Whale', now
have a well deserved
respect on the circuit,
especially since our team
is, at present, conspiciously
unatheletic. A similarly
omenous result was
achieved in the open circuit
race.
One further product of
this prestigious ocassion is
that we have, apparently,
been presented with the
chance to diversify into the
water, having been given
the hull, propeller, drive
sytem and foil moulds to
make our own tandem
hydrofoil. Anyone willing to
stick these together will
have the undoubted
pleasure of burning off
boat club at a least 15
knots.
After this potted and
contestably over-florid
introduction to our history
and achievements, which I
hope has caught your
mental eye, now down to
the heavy stuff.
So far our club has eeked
out its existence upon the
broad and bounteous back
of our best of burden, the
Windcheetah. As I pointed
out previously, in HPV
performance the name of
the game is frontal area,
although mass is also a
weighty factor; in both
respects the Windcheetah
is crampingly restrictive.
Body shell design is
.ultimately limited by the
dictates of the vehicle
beneath it, and our present
one has possibly the
largest frontal area on the
circuit (although its drag,
as rated by performance ,
is comparatively low). The
whole contraption,
including the bodyshell,
weighs a crippling 70lbs, at
least, of which the
bodyshell's own support
frame contributes a
wasteful 15lbs. To progress
we must build a new
machine and, to this end,
four undergraduate
research projects have
been proposed, liased
together, to engineer a new
machine.
The bones of the new
HPV have already been
sketchily mapped out
through practical and
competative experience, as
well as some theory, giving
an elegant and novel
approach to the problem of
HPV design. It will be a
tricycle of the same
configuration as the
Windcheetah but that is
where all parity ends.
Firsly, the new design uses
entirely full size wheels and
high pressure tyres. The
elongated, tear drop
shaped nacelle of the rider
compartment is elevated at
least a foot off the ground
to avoid wasting the limited
power for forward motion
on ground effects and has
the rider as recumbent as
possible. It will be made as
a fiber-glass honeycomb
sandwhich monocoque
which , coupled with the
the aerofoil section fin
housing trhe rear wheel
(the fin doubling as a T
girder at the weakest point
in the riders pallet, under
his bottom.) , provides the
structural rigidity of the
vehicle. The steered front
wheels are housed
outboard in their own
nacelles, at the end of
'wings', to keep the frontal
area as low as possible.
The projects split up as
follows:-
1) Determine the lowest
frontal area rider orientaion
with most efficient muscle
use; design seat to avoid
back injury, for maximum
adjustability (club members
come in many marvellous
shapes and sizes) and for
easy access to chain and
gearing beneath it.
