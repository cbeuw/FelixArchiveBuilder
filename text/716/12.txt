V
Guilds
Last Saturday was a great
day for Guilds; over 150
people turned up to tiddly-
wink for Rag. The
enthusiasm and energy that
everyone put in resulted in
us raising more money
than ever before and being
the top C C U . Thank you
for everyone who helped.
My only slight regret is
realizing how many
Guildsmen and women who
wanted to come and would
have loved it, couldn't quite
make the effort to get out
of bed. Don't worry, there
will be plenty of other
opportunity to contribute.
The next big event is
Monopoly Rag on Saturday
19 October. When we play
monopoly in London and
actually visit Old kent Road
and Angel Islington, and
everywhere else, though we
hope that 'Go directly to
Jail' will not feature in our
partucular version. Rag is a
good opportunity to do
something for people
outside the College who
need help whilst having fun
ourselves and giving the
public something to
brighten up their day.
The pub crawl on the
Saturday night also went
very well. A number of
guests from RSMU and
RCSU joined in along with
two girls from an American
College consisting of 80%
female. They had a lot of
nice things to say about the
way they had been looked
after and want to bring
their friends to the next
Guilds events. This only
proves that a successful,
fun night out without
everyone having to vomit,
to prove what a good
drinkers they are, results in
a much more social
environment that attracts
others both in and outside
Guilds.
In the mean time we look
forward to seeing you all,
with members of staff, at
your departmental dinners,
which shouldn't be missed
by anyone, undergraduates
and post graduates alike.
QT
Our political correspondant
writes after the fiascos of
the SDP and Labour party
conferences it was a
welcome relief last night to
be present at the big
oneâ€”the QT conference
held in the prestigious
Union Lounge (apparently
wanted very badly by
another group, but they
had to settle for the Winter
Gardens, Blackpool).
In the jovial atmosphere
of the conference hall the
speeches were kept short
and decisive, mainly due to
the quanty of Jelly and
Custard present.
The policies decided
upon, and referred to the
National Executive, should
ensure that QT builds on
last year's success and
becomes a powerful force
in..in whatever it's
supposed to be a powerful
force in.
The shock decision to
announce a candidate for
ICU President come as
quite a surprise. Normal
policy dictates an
announcement in the
Spring term, but the grass-
roots membership of QT,
the rank and file, felt that
their man would benefit
from prolonged publicity
throughout the year. An
amendment to the motion
which was subsequently
passed, ensured that for
security reasons the name
of the candidate would be
withheld from the press.
This constant fear of
political assassination
could possibly harm QT's
chances of forming the
majority party at the next
election.
The conference was
brought to its feet when
somebody removed the
chairs during the rousing
closing speech by the Party
Leader: 'And I tell you
brothers and sisters, that as
the democratically elected
leader of their society, I
have been given a clear
mandate by the majority of
my members to wish you a
very good night!'.
So the conference
season ends for another
year with QT promoted to
the first division, hopefully
qualifying for Europe next
year.
Orienteering
Imperial college
Orienteering Club had a
tremendous start to the
season, dominating the
GLC championships, the
ladies tipped the men with
a win in W19 by Nora
Tanner, and a third in W21
by Sally McLean. Best
placed of the men were
Tom Foster and Andy
Shoreman second and third
in M19.
Club meetings are in
Southside Bar Thursday
evenings and Fridays 12.30
in the Union Upper
Lounge.
