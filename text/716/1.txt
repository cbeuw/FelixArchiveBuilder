Whose Bar is
it Anyway?
College Secretary John Smith
has agreed to discuss plans for
the Union to take control of the
Union Bar, following a meeting
with Union President Carl
Burgess on Monday. Mr Smith
and Mr Burgess will each be
investigating the feasibility of a
takeover and will report to
House Committee on November
6.
Feelings have been running
high all week as a result of the
seven day bar boycott which
was imposed at the last U G M .
Mr Smith commented to FELIX
that the issue had become
rather immotive. Conflicting
stories have been circulating
about the prospects of the
Union Bar coming under the
Union's control. On Monday
evening Mr Burgess was
confident that the Union would
soon be taking over the bar.By
Tuesday afternoon he was more
cautious and was only prepared
to say that plans were 'in hand'.
Mr Burgess told FELIX that
the boycott was not intended as
a move to bring the bar under
Union control. The boycott, he
said, was simply a
demonstration of dissatisfaction
with the way the bars were
being run by refectory manager
Rob Northey. Mr Burgess
stressed that he had made this
point clear to Mr Smith.
Mr Smith wrote a letter to Mr
Burgess on Tuesday outlining
the position for possible
negotiations. He told FELIX on
Friday that the control of the
Union Bar should be discussed
in a 'wider context', and that
there was a considerable
amount of preliminary work to
be done. He said that there
were several matters of
significance which had been
'left unresolved' and referred to
his discussions with last year's
Union Executive about the
control of rooms in the Union
Building. He denied that the
Union would necessarily face a
substantial cut in its subvention
from College if control of the
bar was transferred. He added,
however, that matters such as
the maintenance and upkeep of
the Union building would also
enter into any discussions of
plans for the whole of the Union
Building. He said that he was
keen to clear up the very vague
position of who had control of
the building. He was particularly
The Union Bar on Wednesday
keen to see that better use was
made of some rooms, such as
the kitchens behind the Union
Lounge.
Mr Burgess was also keen to
point out that there was a large
amount of investigation work to
be done before proposals could
be submitted. He said that he
would like to see the whole of
the north side of the Union
Building under Union control.
The bar boycott appears to
have been very succesful with
only a very small number of
students choosing to drink in
College bars. Southside bar has
had no more than twenty
customers on any evening, most
of whom have been non-
students or workmen. The
Union bar was entirely empty
for most of Wednesday night,
usually one of the busiest
evenings of the week. Refectory
manger Rob Northey and
Southside Bar manager Roger
Pownell both complimented
Carl Burgess and the students
on a very effective boycott. Mr
Burgess said that there was no
need for further action after the
end of the week, as the students
had successfully made their
feelings known.
Southside Shuffle
Southside residents are
complaining about
modifications to the kitchen
facilities. Work is already in
progress to convert one
bedroom on each staircase into
a kitchen, and the present
kitchen and laundry room on
the gallery level of each hall
into bedrooms.
The current plan is opposed
by both the Tizard and Selkirk
Hall Committees; at present
both are made up entirely of
second and third year re-apps.
They feel that the changes
would 'considerably
inconvenience' students with
bedrooms on the gallery level,
who would have to put up with
noise from the frequent social
gatherings there. The
committees feel also that
staircase kitchens would prove
'smelly' and 'noisy' serving only
to shift the social focus away
from the gallery and into the
staircase. Furthermore
disruption would be caused by
the construction work involved.
An alternative has been
suggested by the Selkirk
committee. This is to expand
the existing kitchen facilities,
replacing the lockers and tables
with extra cookers. The lockers
and tables would be placed in
the now ex-laundry room, along
with the staircase fridges. It is
intended by the committee that
the drying room in the ex-
laundry be retained, and they
will be pressing for the central
laundry to be expanded.
IC Union and the Student
Residence Committee are in
favour of staircase kitchens. J
Martin Taylor, one of last year's
student representatives on the
SRC pointed out that the
problems were discussed by the
SRC in May and it was decided
that the advantages of the
proposals now being
implimented outweighted any
disadvantages.
