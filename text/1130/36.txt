T
he D.E.A Project are coming
straight from the streets of South
toncion and is made up of the
three strong crew of DJ Para, Lalee &
Lloyd - and they not only own the label
but are also the main, well only artists on
the label; for now anyhow.
I'd describe this label as the Creative
Source / Goodlooking records of the
Garage world, a label that hasn't been
influenced by passing trends, just stick-
ing with and exploring their own dis-
tinctive sound. Taking influences from a | |
musical styles, but most noticeably I

strong musical present e
depth of sound - from 1
nal breaks, beats and more n' rawiw-
inal vocals. This stance

We mel up at Lalec's liousi
to find a ralhca bedraggled looking Dj
Para (he'd been in the studio all i
and Lalee looking lively as ever, before
long Lloyd and Pypee arrived v
curried chicken but they seemed to have
forget mine, but never mind aye... (now
in case you were wondering who this
fourth member is, Pypee I'm told takes
care of the business and promotional
side if tings, ok)
Para do you think being one of the
top DJs on Upfront 99.3fm has helped
the label ?
Para "Being on Upfront in general has
helped, people are getting to hear the
music out on the streets. It's helped and
Upfront have given us full support from
the word go, big up to them."
Lalee "But it ain't down to the radio for
our success, that's down to the quality of
the tracks, but the support from the
pirates has helped, Upfront, London
Underground, freak, Taste, they're con-
stantly on the phone to us for beats and
they're playing urn "
Para "Anyone talking about DEA helps,
weather it's talking to ya mate in the
street. It don't matter it all helps."
With Para playing out so much, I

Pypee "And the MC had gone for a drink
or something, so there was no-one
telling him to, it was just from the crowd
reaction - that's what you call a reload...."
Lalee "Yeah that's what I'm saying we
know it's bad but you have to let things
sink in for other people, with Circles - we
made that in January - February and it's
taken too Sept- Oct for people to be
ready for it."
This probably has some thing to do
with the subtle nature of your tracks,
they have a certain quality In depth that
isn't that e\ ident at first listen.
Pypee "You know what it's like, it's like a
Salvador Dali painting - one minute you

Para "Yeah, the aibums nearly done, but
it's not coming out until next year -1 eb-
March sort of time, it's better to get it

album?
Lloyd "twelve too fifteen"
All new?
Lalee "Stuff that's been released from old

Para "plus a couple ot exclusives"
Lalee "Cause vou know enough people

money."
