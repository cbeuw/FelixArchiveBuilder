Japanese director Takeshi kitano also stars as a battling
yakuza cop. Graphic violence contrasts with under-
stated reflection to stunning effect.
TwentyFourSeven
Feature length debut from British writer/director Shane
Meadows is both entertaining and emotive.
My name isJoe'
Peter Mullan's magnetic performance is central to Ken
foach's film of love, loyalty and desperation in Glasgow.
The Big Lebowski]
Not the Coen brothers' best film by a long chalk, but
a reminder of their inventive vision.
Boogie Nights
Paul Thomas Anderson invites comparisons with some
of cinema's legends, from Altman to Scorsese, with his
tale of Burt Reynold's porno producing 'family.'
Mark
Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
Along with Trainspotting one of the best and freshest
films to come out of Britain in the last couple of years.
Good Will Hunting
Just the right blend of drama, humour and emotion
which doesn't get bogged down in sentiment.
As Good as it Gets
An original screenplay that made for a delightful if
flawed film. Nicholson is amazing, although I'm not con-
vinced at Helen Hunt's Oscar.
Starshlp troopers
Acting - Neighboursesque. Plot - where? Script - see plot.
Nonetheless this was a hilarious film with great special
effects. Pure entertainment, minimal thinking required.
77fan/c
Actually, this didn't make it anywhere near my top five,
but I'd just like to point out how poor it was. Dull, dull, dull.

THE TRUMAN SHOW
"Mi
any reviewers have focused on The
Truman Show as a dramatic turn
around in Jim Carrey's career - proof
that he really can cut it as a serious actor. This cre-
ates the impression that this is a masterpiece of
modern film-making, a serious moral drama investi-
gating the power of TV. Yet this simply isn't true -
The Truman Show is a brilliant example of near per-
fect film making, but for different reasons.
First of all, forget any film made in the last twenty
years. Truman has far more in common with the Hol-
lywood of the thirties and forties than the mega-bucks
methods of today. Think back to the days of Cary
Grant and James Stewart and classic feelgood movies
like It's A Wonderful Life, and you're in the right kind
of territory.
.Above all, it's Carrey's showcase performance
that drives the film towards classic status. Amidst his
utterly unreal surroundings, he manages to remain
totally believable, an average, everyday guy, strug-
gling to discover the truth of what's going on around
him, never daring to believe the full nature of the cor-
porate universe that surrounds him. Not only every
scene he appears in, but the entire movie revolves
around his performance and ultimately relies on him
for its success.
The relative successes of The Truman Show and
some of this Summer's all-action outings should
finally send the message to Hollywood that well
thought out, well written movies can be successful.
OK, so this time next yeat we'll probably have to put
up with an endless stream of Truman rip-offs, but
maybe-just maybe-the unlikely combination of Weir
and Carrey could herald the return of old-style values
to movie-making. Quite simply, that's how good this
movie is. Cliched as it may be, I feel compelled to say
it : If you only see one movie this year, then make
sure it's The Truman Show. } 9
(Fxcerpts from Felix 11211
Wei
LA Confidential
The best thriller of the year, mixing corrupt police and
prostitutes who look like movie stars into a classic
thriller.
Starship Troopers
[The best B film of the year. Beverly Hills 90210 meets
Full Metal Jacket, with big bugs, big guns and an appal-
ing script, it's an enjoyable no brainer.
Devils Advocate
This reworking of Faust is extravagant, with some
impressive effects.
Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]
The best British film. This film managed to take the best
things from the Tarantino genre and slapping on a
British production makes it ultra cool.
Titanlci
A film that costs $300 million deserves some credit.
Dave
The Truman Shorn
Simply the best film I've seen in years. Frank Capra
moves into the nineties, courtesy of Peter Weir
Sllngblade]
A virtuoso performance from Billiy Bob Thornton, finally'
released two years after it hit screens in the US.
Theres Something About Mary\
Definately the year's funniest movie. Two or three set
pieces may have got all the attention, but its the non-
stop torrent of gags that earn it a place in the top five.
As Good As It Gets]
Nicholson deservedly won an Oscar for his portrayal of
a neurotic, obsessive writer. Funny, offbeat and well-writ-
ten , it's an example of real film-making at its best.
Lethal Weapon 4
A no brainer? Certainly. But what's wrong with a bit of
mindless entertainment from time to time?
The best of 1999?
