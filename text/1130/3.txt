Health Centre Cut-Backs
Cut backs in Health Centre opening
hours are putting students and staff at
risk, according to senior College safety
officials.
Unbeknownst to the majority of
staff, students and even departmental
first-aiders, the College Health Centre
no longer opens on Tuesday after-
noons. As a result of a serious incident
on 1 December, this decision is now
facing stern criticism. A member of
the technical staff In the Biochemistry
Department suffered serious cuts to
her hand, which resulted in one liga-
ment being completely severed and
another being 90% detached. Follow-
ing standard practice, the technician
was taken over to the Health Centre,
in Princes' Gardens. On arrival, how-
ever, she discovered that the Health
Centre is closed on Tuesday after-
noons, and there is no emergency
cover. Although she was eventually
taken to casualty by taxi, according to
one safety rep "there was still a dan-
gerously large amount of time wasted
before the injured technician man-
aged to get to hospital".
The decision to reduce opening

hours, for 'administrative reasons' has
been attacked by Keith Hatch, the
Chemistry Safety Rep, as "disgusting ...

cised in both felix and IC Reporter.

there can be no justification for putting
staff and students at extra risk by
reducing the provision of emergency
treatment". He goes on to criticise the
notification that the Health Centre has
given those responsible for College
safety, "though I've heard that the
Health Centre is shut on Tuesday after-
noon I don't recall getting anything
official".
Dr Weinreb, the Clinical Services
Manager at the Health Centre, has
appear to have been published until
this week (in response to a request
from Dr Weinreb, which was received
last Monday). Paul Garden, the Joint
Trade Unions Safety Rep, has also
noted that "apart from some of the
security, no others in the on site first
aid and emergency aid know of the
reduced medical cover...at the
moment there is complete confusion
after the event because of the lack of
information that has been issued".
This, he feels, is "putting students and
staff potentially at risk".
In her defence, Dr Weinreb has
suggested that the problem has arisen
only as a result of the technician's deci-
sion not to contact the cover available
via the Health Centre answerphonc
service; "the Health Centre cannot take
responsibility for those who chose not
to follow these instructions". She goes
on to add that "there is emergency
cover on Tuesday afternoons and there
arc very clear instructions both at the
Health Centre and on our answer-
phone as to how to access it".
Nevertheless, both Mr Hatch and
Mr Garden feel that the closure of the
Health Centre during official College
hours is inherently dangerous, with
Mr Hatch describing it as "something
I feci is totally wrong". Moreover,
Security Chief Ken Weir has informed
felix that the closure of the Health
Centre "doesn't make any difference to
our response". The present situation
has been summed up by one senior
figure with the words "just remember
not to have an accident on Tuesday
afternoons".
Spate Of Thefts Plagues Campus
A succession of thefts took place
across the South Kensington campus
on the night of Tuesday 8 December.
Two video recorders were stolen along
with a sizeable amount of cash, from
Beit Quad and Electrical Engineering.
Beit Hall lost a VCR machine, which
was taken from the Old Hostel's com-
mon room. According to Ken Weir,
Chief Security Officer, there was no
sign of forced entry into the hall.
Violence was definitely used in the
Union, however, as thieves stole a VCR
machine from the International
Enrichment Office in the north-west
corner of Beit Quad by making a hole
in the plaster-board wall.
The intruders penetrated the outer
door, behind the Union Dining Hall,
which had apparently been left open,
before trying to force the RAG office
door. When this failed they cut through
the wall, pushed over the bookcase
behind it, and took the VCR. Unfortu-
nately for them it is an American
model which isn't compatible with the
UK system.
Meanwhile the drinks machine on
the second floor of the Union was
forcefully broken into and almost

entirely emptied of its coins. Evidence
was also discovered which suggested
that the coffee machine in the Union
foyer (on the ground floor) had been
tampered with.
Over in Electrical Engineering,
thieves gained access to the under-
graduate common room just inside
the main entrance, and broke into the
pool table and coffee machine, steal-
ing the cash within. As the machines
contained only coins the thieves' tak-
ings are unlikely to come to much,
but Ken Weir explained that there was
no way to account for the exact
amount stolen.
Although the incidences in Beit
Quad and Electrical Engineering arc
not necessarily related, Ken Weir did
comment that there were "similarities
in the damage done lo the machines".
He added that "some forensic evi-
dence was obtained from the scene of
the crime", but could not comment
further, as "it is a police matter now".
If anyone saw anything suspicious
in the vicinity of Beit Quad or Electri-
cal Engineering on Tuesday night, they
should contact Sherfield security on
