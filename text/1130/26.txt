What's Up There?
Richard Hopkins takes a light-hearted look at practical astronomy you
can enjoy this Christmas
You've eaten too many mince pies, are
fed up with hearing about Uncle Jeff's
Loft conversion, and all your friends have
gone off skiing. What now? Don't
despair! If the sky is clear, and you're
stuck for things to do over the Christmas
break then take a trip outside one night.
The winter is the best time of year to go
stargazing. The cold weather makes the
sky very clear (assuming there are no
clouds of course!), as water condenses
on tiny ait borne particles (like smog and
dust haze), and they are literally washed
out of the sky. Also, the short winter
days mean that the nights are both long,
and very dark. These things allow fainter
objects to be seen, and many more stars
become visible.
So, what can you expect to see, and
what equipment will you need? The
answers are: lots, and just your eyes!
(And perhaps some binoculars as well).
Some of the constellations, approximate
times, and approximate directions to
look are outlined below.
Orion-The Hunter
This beautiful con-
stellation is easily
recognised by the 3
stars that make up
Orion's belt. Look
SE any time aftet
19:00. Just next to
Orion, you will find
his trusty dog, Sir-
ius, the 'Dog Star'.
This is the btightest
star in the sky, and twinkles all sorts of
pretty colouts due to refraction in thc
Earth's atmosphere.
The Plough (or Saucepan)
Handy one this if you get over enthusi-
astic about your stargazing and get lost
in the middle of the night. The two end
stars away from the 'handle' of the
saucepan point towards the pole star
(North)..Look for the plough low down
in thc NE, at any time of night.
Cygnus - The Swan
The constellation looks like a cross, and
lies in the middle of the Milky Way, point-
ing along it. Look for it in thc west in thc
early evening.
Cassiopeia
This constellation looks like a slightly
bent 'W. It is also in the Milky Way. Use
the second 'V shape to find the Androm-
eda Galaxy, find it high up in the west,
in the evening.
Leo - The Lion
This constellation looks like a trapezium,
but thc darker the sky, thc more stars in
it become visible. No mattet how dark it
is though, it still doesn't look like a lion,
find it low down in the east after 22:30
Other naked eye objects visible
include...
The Milky Way
This stretches tight actoss thc sky, all
night. It passes through the constellations
of Cygnus and Cassiopeia. On a dark,
moon-less night, it can't be missed and
is a beautiful sight, forget seeing it in
tondon though, the sky isn't dark
enough!
The Andromeda Galaxy
This object
is quite
faint. Look
for Cas-
siopeia, and
then follow
along the
line that the second V is pointing. If
you are lucky, then nearby you will see
a faint fuzzy object in the sky. Congrat-
ulations, the light you are seeing left the
galaxy 2.2 million years ago!
The Pleiades
This is a star cluster, and contains many
young, blue, stars. Most people can see
at least 4 of them, but some can sec
more (there are seven bright ones,
hence the popular name of 'Seven Sis-
ters'). A look at them through binoculars
reveals many more. Look any time in
the evening, roughly south, and quite
high. At a fitst glance, the cluster looks
like a smear, but a careful look reveals
that it is in fact many stars very close
together.
The Planets
Jupiter and Saturn can be seen in the
evening, quite low, in thc south. They arc
both very bright, and don't twinkle like
stats, lor the real enthusiasts (or party-
goers!), Mars is also visible in the south-
cast, but not until 3 in thc morning.
Towards the end of the holiday, Venus
will be visible in the evening, just after
the sun has gone down, and near by. It
is very bright.
The Moon
full on the 3rd of
December and
2nd of January.
New on the 19th
of December
and 17th of Jan-
uary. If you want
to see the Milky
Way, and other faint objects, go when
the moon is nearly new, because then
the moon is small, and sets early in the
evening (or gets up late at night), and
this makes the sky much darker.
Meteors
Can happen any time, any place! I hey
are usually quite rare - you might see one
or two an hour if you are lucky. There will
be ever so slightly more than normal
around thc New Year.
Satellites
Ihe most common satellites are spent
rocket boosters and other junk - only a
few things orbiting the Earth actually do
anything useful. They move across thc
sky in about 10 minutes, and can be
brighter than stats.
Do try lo have a look outside, weather
permitting. Out wrap up warm, and take
a friend to chat to, or you'll end up spend-
ing all night there just gazing! If you have
