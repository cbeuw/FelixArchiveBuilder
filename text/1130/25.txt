Augustin de Bettignies looks at the raid on the Back Beat Club earlier this month, and asks whether such aggressive police
action is really the best way to deal with the drugs problem in Britain...
On Tuesday 1 December five hundred
London Police officers made a quasi-mil-
itary assault on a club in a back street off
Charing Cross Road, in the most impor-
tant or rather aggressive anti-drugs oper-
ation in the capital ever. Back Beat club
was under discrete police surveillance for
five months for being suspected of being
a latge-scale drug den. The place was
known by an increasing number of peo-
ple of all ages for being an important
complex were cannabis could freely be
bought and smoked. The seizure was
actually quite disappointing for such a
major operation: 'only' £100,000 of
cannabis (herb & hash) and £70,000 of
cash were reported by spokesmen.
This 'raid' opens yet another debate
on the use of cannabis as a recreational
drug. Developed countries have led a
'war on drugs' for the past forty years, by
repressing consumption, especially in
the US where they have in fact sent
planes to bum down fields in Columbia.
But no approach has managed to effec-
tively do something about the 'drug phe-
nomenon'. In fact, the number of users
has never stopped increasing.
So maybe we could try to think about
the philosophy behind the use of recre-
ational drugs. Diverse
plants and mushrooms
containing mentally active
substances were used in
the most ancient civilisa-
tions during rituals to
'enlighten' minds and
bring people together, and even Aldous
Huxley thought of his 'ideal' society in
"Brave New World" being based on the
universal but limited use of a drug to
ensure the happiness of the people and
public order. So why are governments so
keen on repressing the use of recre-
"...people do
and will always
smoke dope..."
ational drugs? Why are drugs illegal? The
'official' answer is that most drugs affect
public health and can lead to death,
bolh in the long and short term. But the
other answer is that the money going
into the drugs industry is money being
pumped out of the business cycle, and
reduces the consumption of manufac-
tured, taxed products; thus
reducing growth and
employment. Some say
"why not legalise cannabis
like the Netherlands?" so
that the State would make
money, with which it could
maybe fight more efficiently against
'harder' drugs, as cannabis is now recog-
nised to be less harmful than tobacco
and alcohol. However, most govern-
ments are very far from the idea of adopt-
ing a similar drug policy to that of the
Netherlands (that has actually proven to
be 'positive' as there are similar propor-
tions of smokers and (hard) drug addicts
in Holland as there are in its neighbour-
ing countries). Actions like the one car-
ried out earlier this month confirm how
British drug policy is stubbornly kept as
stupidly repressive as ever.
The point is, even without changing
the law, although it is being quite hypo-
critical, as people do and will always
smoke dope, why not tolerate places
such as the Back Beat dub? Only an eso-
teric community of people 'already into
it' went there, as the place was difficult
to find and know about, and practiced
their favourite hobby without harming
society in any other way. They were
NOT buying booze on friday nights, and
littering the streets with cans, broken
glass, piss and puke...
