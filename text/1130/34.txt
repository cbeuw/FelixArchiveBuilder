Paul Weller: Chair-Rock Pioneer.
A
s everyone knows, Christmas is getting closer and
closer and this is Paul Weller's go at trying to get
some more royalties for himself to pay for the festive
season. Although this makes good business sense, this
album is probably only ever going to reach those of you who
are already fans. Saying that, if you are not a Paul Weller fan
or you think you have never heard of him before I would rec-
ommend this to you, as it is so easy to listen to. This would
make an ideal Christmas present for that Tm-so-laid-back-
that-l-fall-over' person or maybe your Dad.
Just imagine lying in a park with the sun shining and a cool
drink with some music floating in the background. If you can
imagine this then that is what this album is like. It isn't a 'Chrlst-
mas-y' album but it will bring a bit of sunshine into your oth-
erwise wet, miserable December.
This is an extremely mellow album with plenty of cool tunes
such as Wild Wood and Changing Man. It's the sort of music
you know you have heard some where but you're not sure
where. The music is that familiar it makes you feel so very com-
fortable. In total, there are sixteen tracks of pure summer bliss.
Broken Stones is my personal favourite as it makes me want
to warble along to my heart's content.
These are definitely the greatest hits of Paul Weller so just
hit the repeat button and relax! CI

THE BLACK CROWES
Black Crowes - Horticultural
experts, you know.
T
his album has been seen by
many people as make-or-break
time for The Black Crowes. Their
first two albums, Shake Your
Moneymaker and The Southern
I larmony Companion, are both regard-
ed as classic bluesy rock albums. Next
came Amorica which was mainly
remembered for it's cover and little
else.
The worst was yet to come, first the
band unleashed Three Snakes and One
Charm, an album that was far too self
indulgent for it's own good. The gigs in
support of it were even worse,- the band-
would simply jam for most of the set with
little in the way of recognisable material.
Fans were starting to worry that weed
and other substances were starting to
affect the band. Thankfully this album-
suggests that the band's head/arse inter-
face is at an end and they are ready to
write some feel good, southern boogie
rock once more.
The album kicks off with Go Faster
which is an infectious speedy number
with a catchy chorus. Next up is Klckln'
My Heart Around, thefirst single taken
from the album, which comes at you at
the same pace. Then the band slow
down - nothing reaches the pace that the
opening two numbers set but most of
the time you won't even notice it. This
album is filled with hooks and choruses
that claw their way into your brain and
won't let go. Virtually every song on here
just makes you want to get up and
dance. This is a great return to form.
That said, not everything is perfect.
For starters the vocals veer a bit to close
to Rod Stewart at times, particularly on By
Your Side, which may be alright if you like
the pseudo-Scotsman but I suspect that
many fans won't. It doesn't ruin the
songs, though, it merely tarnishes them
slightly.
The other problem is that on Wel-
come To The Good 7/mesthere are hints
of the band of old - the song being
pretty much a display of how well the
band can play. This in itself is not a bad
thing. It's just that the track is too long
and attention starts to wane. On the
good side the arrangements are firstclass
in every song with harmonica, electric
organ and what is probably a gospel
choir really adding to the overall feel. The
album ends with the excellent combi-
nation of Go Tell The Congregation and
Virtue and Vice. The former being one of
the best song to end analbum that I've
ever heard. This really is a fun party
record. El
