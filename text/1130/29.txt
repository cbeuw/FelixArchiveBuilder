Shpongle - Are you
Shpongled?
(Twisted Records)
When I first heard this LP and
ploughed through the seven tracks on it
I was going to slag it off for all I was
worth. But then I left it for a while, and
the bastard began to grew on me \nd
not like a bad fungus

Simon Posford and "sp8i :eeIs..o
naut" (their cleat in it
Ram, and the pair lirsl
India. You can certainty tell. Apart
the out-of-it nature of the musie that
they have produced the alburn is
wilt: hints and
trnent. And I'm always a fan of a Iftftrti
of eastern influence - it usually adds
depth and flavour to any Westerner's
music (just look at the Beatles).
The album is chilled to the
extreme in many places, and just plain
weird in others. Definitely one for when
you are partaking of a little Bob Hope,
with a nice side plate of fungi. In parts
is at others it
verges on the madness of the Ozric I en-
lae les \c\er a duft moment. Simply lie

Locked On III - Various
Mixed by Ramsey & Fen), (Phuturetrax)
This is all about the underground garage
scene (and especially the healthy London
scene), and is made up of all the biggest
and best tracks from '98. That's why it's
packed full of garage anthems and why
it's mixed by up-and-coming stars Ram-
sey & fen, who should soon be
overground to rival the likes
intosh.

Hinos e\ ervwh' -
n il ic ' or:
bag of shite song like The Heartists
sound groovy, and believe me that takes
talent! You get large doses of soul. And
that's not surprising 'cos Ramsey and
fen say that they have been heavily influ-
enced by soul, R&B, and electro, with ail
these elements being important in the
creation of their very own "sweet but
bumpy groove."
The mixing here is as smooth as the
men in a Gillette ad - completely seam-
less, withoup§toigle fault. It could just
as easily M onelfcry. very long song.
Seeing thfse two atmprk in a club would
be a gjjfat experieame, 'cos anybody
