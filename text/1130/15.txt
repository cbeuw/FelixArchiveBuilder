100 MASTERPIECES OF IMPERIAL CHINESE CERAMICS FROM THE AD
BAR LING COLLECTION
Royal Academy of Arts
p:
Western world In the 18th century.
In contrast, China's ceramic production
originated during the Bronze Age. With
such a flourishing past, craftsmen
attained incredible levels of technical
proficiency. Under the influence of the
emperor and senior court officials, pot-
ters and decorators experimented pro-
fusely, exploring form and function in
accordance with fashion.
This legendary collection, which
over the past 25 years by the entrepre-
neur and connoisseur Au Bak Ling. This
eagerly anticipated event was its first
ever public viewing. The exhibition out-
lines the highlights of Chinese porcelain
manufacture, as well as reflecting paral-
lel developments in cultural history. The
displayed pieces, hailed as unique
national treasures, date from between
the 12th and 18th centuries, covering the
Song, Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties.
The varied designs arc
either sophisticated with
simple glazing or vibrantly
ornamented, with fiery
dragon emblems and
colourful floral motifs. In
view of the highly spe-
cialised subject matter, this
stylish exhibition is basi-
cally geared towards
Sinophiles or dedicated
enthusiasts.

W
ith the countdown to Christmas
in full swing, this section would
be shamefully incomplete with-
out mentioning that most sacred and
venerated of festive traditions-the inim-
itable pantomime.
Admittedly, I was slightly dubious on
surveying my fellow spectators, since I
estimated the average age of the audi-
ence to be about eight! (after all, this is
blatant family entertainment) Undeterred
by my fidgeting neighbours however, I
settled down to watch the production
billed as 'a new telling of an old classic'.
Although during one worrying scene,
the excruciatingly shy Buttons threat-
ened to ride into the sunset with the
comely crumpet (much to the horror of
the distraught and disillusioned crowd!),
Angela Cartet's interpretation remained
reassuringly faithful to the classic. Well,
most of the time at least... Somehow, I
don't quite remember the evil step-
mother brandishing a carving knife (pre-
viously concealed in her cleavage!) and
hacking off her daughters' toes or heel
in a desperate attempt to squeeze their
feet into the celebrated glass slipper.
The actors, with the exception of
the bland and amateurish dead mother
cum fairy godmother, worked enthusi-
astically as a team, improvising liberally
to suit the audience's responses. Cin-
ders, sporting ragged petticoats and char-
coal smudges, was perfectly irritating
with her goody-two-shoes naivety and
her unwavering habit of exclaiming
"weird" during her magical adventures in
pantoland. In contrast, the
cross-dressing ugly sisters
duo was extremely farcical in
curlers and pink negliges
with fake-fur trimmings.
Their antics and snappy dia-
logue (with lyrics such as
"The prince will be thrilled to
bits/By the size of my... per-
sonality") raised much laugh-
ter rivalled only by the snog
finale that caused a wave of
snickering amongst the
junior clique, accompanied
by murmurs of "kissywissy".
Probably the most
impressive aspect of this pro-
duction, staged by the
Improbable Theatre, were
the inventive special effects
and resourceful props. Giant
cardboard cut-outs were sur-
prisingly effective as scenery,
creating an almost illusory
atmosphere whereas crum-
pled newspaper sheets were
moulded into ghostly crea-
tures, further enhancing the
fantasy.
luncless musical interludes and pup-
pet sketches were integrated into this
amusing extravaganza. Perhaps the high-
light of the evening was a ridiculous ren-
dition of 'Cheese in the Moonlight'
performed by a squeaky chorus of mar-
ionette mice. Pantomimes definitely rank
beyond the ridiculous, obscure and
corny, yet they're genuinely enjoyable if
you join in the formulaic spirit along the
condensed lines of "Once upon a
time...behind you...oh! yes he is...happily
ever after".
