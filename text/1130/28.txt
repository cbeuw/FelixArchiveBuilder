What we talk about when we talk about love
by Raymond Carver
Harvill Press
S
hort and not so sweet stories
make up this collection of tales set
in midwest America, by the late
Raymond Carver, who has been
described by Salman Rushdie as "One
of America's most original, truest
voices", with this particular collection of
stories being acclaimed in the literary
world as a 'masterpiece' of much influ-
ence in the 1980s (when first pub-
lished).
After reading this on the front and
back pages I was, of course, tempted
to open It up and read on. Now in my
review I am glad to say I don't disagree
with the fact that these stories are very
good and of a different style than I am
used to reading, which makes me feel
better and restores some faith in my lit-
erary appreciation skills!
The title story of this collection is a
good example of the hidden depths of
these stories, with their insightful dia-
logue, usually written in the first person
describing relationships between men
and women, the emotions and differ-
ences of opinions between both, which
is clearly a recurrent theme.
Carver writes as either a lonely,
tired housewife or a self-centred trav-
elling salesman in situations that oth-
erwise would seem benign, but there
is always an element of intensity and
darkness in each story which makes it
memorable and in some cases quite
disturbing. There is, however, demon-
stration of a wry sense of humour
linked to Carver's observations of
human behaviour which made this col-
lection entertaining and light in places.
Perhaps one of the more disturbing
tales is 'Tell the Women We're Going'
which is in effect an account of a man,
Bill, who ends up being witness to his
childhood friend, Jerry, killing two
women randomly after what started as
an unplanned drive along the highway
to get away from their wives and chil-
dren at home. Throughout, it offers lit-
tle explanation and doesn't reveal the
horrible outcome until the last para-
graph of its nine pages; "He never knew
what Jerry wanted. But it started and
ended with a rock. Jerry used the same
rock on both girls, first on the girl called
Sharon and then on the one that was
supposed lo be Bill's."
The abrupt endings remind me of
the X-Files (excuse the comparison!)
where even though it can be irritating
not to know the actual outcome and
consequences, it is still addictive and
enjoyable, with the darker side of our-
selves being strangely satisfied.
The stories evoke emotion and
intrigue and in general I appreciated
Carver's real sense of people and life
and interpretations of relationships.
This is certainly worth a read or
maybe more than one, as proved to be
the case with me, to pick up on all the
messages and to fully appreciate what
this collection potentially offers.

The Tesseract
by Alex Garland
Viking Books, Â£9.99
T
ake six cubes and arrange them
into the shape of a crucifix. Take
two more cubes and stick them
either side of the crucifix, at the point
where the cross is made. Now you
have a tesseract. A tesseract is a four
dimensional object - a hypercube
unravelled.
It isn't necessary to understand this
definition to read the book (thank God)
but this defines Garland's latest novel
- and in case you are wondering, it
isn't an origami book. The Tesseract is
not just one story but several which ini-
tially seem as far removed from each
other as stories can be. It is a true 'Pulp
Fiction' style book in the way that the
book hops from one storyline to
another with no apparent initial con-
nections between them. To start with,
this can be disconcerting as you just get
into one storyline when suddenly a
whole new story begins. However the
links between one storyline and the
next soon become apparent, just small
details to begin with but enough to
keep the reader hooked. Each aspect of
the novel is set in Manila with each
character following their own life com-
pletely unaware of the others, but all
this is about to change.
Sean is waiting for the arrival of
Don Pepe in a derelict hotel on the out-
skirts of Manila, the phone is dead and
there are blood stains on his sheets.
Rosa waits for her husband to come
home whilst patiently dealing with her
mother and children. She remembers
back to her childhood and through her
memories, there arc disturbing revela-
tions. Vinccnte is a street kid whose life
is inexplicably interwoven with that of
a strange man who pays street kids to
hear their dreams. Three people who
have nothing in common but whose
lives are intricately threaded together
by the author to end in a grand finale.
This is Garland's second novel fol-
lowing his earlier success with "The
Beach'. It is a unique style of writing
and your enjoyment will ultimately
depend on your appreciation of this
style. The second storyline is linked to
the first and the third to the first and
second before the final chapters reveal
the outcome. The novel is undoubt-
edly well written but I feel it is some-
thing that may need to be read several
times before the full impact of the
novel hits home. I found there were
several loose ends that didn't quite tie
in at the end, leaving unanswered
questions for the reader, something
that could be quite frustrating.
So would I recommend this book?
Yes, because I haven't read anything
quite like it and il certainly has the
potential to be the next Taratino film
(perhaps with a little more added vio-
lence). A possible Christmas present
for all the family.

Jingo
by Terry Pratchett
Corgi Books
P
ratchet l never erases to
amaze. His latest paper back
release 'jingo' adds to his con-
tinuing line of success, and is the
21st novel in Ihe Discworld
sequence. It sees the return of the
famous Ankh-Morpork City Watch.
This time commander Vimcs and
his fellow officers Captain Carrot,
Sergeant Colon and Corporal
Nobbs, to name a few, have the
prospect of war to deal with
A mvstery island suddenly
appears In the Circle Sea. Being
Discworld, there is a ma|or dispute?
whose territory it comes under. It is
proclaimed in the name- of both
Ankh-Morpork and klatch. Old
wounds between the; neighbouring
countries are re-opened. Then, to
make things worse, a Klatchian
envoy Prince khufurah is shot at
Unseen University's degree cere-
mony procession. It Is up to the
City Watch, the; Ankh-Morpork Police
to discover who the assassin Is and
to prevent a war.
You are taken on a wiid journey
beginning in the city of Ankh-Mor-
pork and travelling across the sea to
the desert country of Klalch. Watch
out for ocean chases, bedstead
storms, fearsome battles, weird del-
icacies, a football match with over
four thousand players and lots
more.
I can't think of a better way lo
relax than to sit down and gel cosy
with a lorry Pratchett novel. I am a
huge fan of his and finished this
novel in two days. Prachetl's
humour takes logic past the point of
absurdity and round again and
never ceases to amuse. It is a must
read for all good fantasy novel fans,
as are all his novels
the novel follows Prate hell's
usual style of being outrageously
funny and a thoroughly good read.
Also, all you Pratchett fans out
there, watch oul for his nexl novo!
'Carpe Jugulum'.
