Win tickets for
Pushca's New Year's
Eve Party
Preview: Pushca - New Year's Eve 1998
Venue - Millenium Dome, London
Dress policy - glamorous at it's best!
Price - £36 members/ £40 non.
You may remember, a few week's
ago, I reviewed a night called Pushca -
London's premier glamour night. Well,
Pushca are doing a New Year's party,
pulling out all the
stops, and are giving
away 2 pairs of tick-
ets (worth £40 each
ticket) to a couple of
lucky Felix readers!!!
Pushca's party
will be called 'Brouhaha' (?) and will take
place at the Millenium Dome, Green-
wich. Pushca's main floor will boast
state of the art sound and light systems,
an imposing tiered central stage (which
will play host to the surprise midnight
show) and a dramatic wallpaper of 30ft
high projections, with emphasis on sex,
fashion and glamour. Pushca will be cre-
ating a highly "pumping party floor".
Another playground adorned with
the spectacular dome vista will take on
a different mood - a space of luxury and
comfort for a debauched social whirl,
heightened fabulously by a proper party
sound of disco trash! I guess they want
it lo be the best ever New Year's Party.
DJs on the night will include Frankie I on-
cett and Darren Darling amongst loads
of others. Now for the competition.
Pushca arc giving 2 Felix readers the
chance to win a pair of tickets each for
this spectacular event, all you have to do

and fashion"

Album - Sleepless
Nights
For those of you who like the Iblzan
Balearic sounds, then you'll know that
the Xtravaganza label is one of the lead-
ers of the genre. They've produced
huge Ibizan anthems such as Chicane's
'Offshore' and 'El Nino' by Agnelli and
Nelson. It's also not surprising that
most balearic compilation albums fea-
ture tracks from this label. Well now
Xtravaganza have released their own
compo. and it's absolutely brilliant.
Mixed by label head and DJ, Alex Gold,
'Sleepless Nights' incorportaes all that is
unique about both Ibiza and the label.
Ihe album comes In double CD format.
One CD features a mix of alt the best
Ibizan anthems ol the lasl few years,
whilst the second CD has a dreamy
floaty, spacey vibe and is the perfect
star t to an evening out, Ali the I ones are
from artists signed to the label, and the
album is worth thomonev Out January
25th.
