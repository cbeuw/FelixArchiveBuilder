A
fter their huge impact on the
student radio chart with 78
Stone Wobble, Gomez have
released this their debut album,
which carries on from where their
single left off. Unusually the band
has two lead singers; one a
Commitments styled voice, perfect
for the blues with its gravelly texture
and the other in contrast vety soft in
sound and these are used in tandem
to perfection. They go through the
songs interchanging the singers to
suit the mood of the songs, which all
hint at different types of guitaring,
ranging from Country to Mexican.
Their lyrics give a lot of the energy
to album, about going down to the
Union, hanging out in Piccadilly or Just
plain trying to get arrested which sum
up life at the moment for the average
student. You feel that their style is
always allowed to flow throughout
and that it was Just wtitten and
recorded because they enjoy it.
Get Myself Arrested, possibly the
OMEZ
Bring It On
best song on the album, encapsu-
lates the essence of the band. The
great harmonies achieved, where
you're not sure who is the lead
singer, as both voices are so
assured, combine with the bounce
of the rhythm and care-free-ness of
the song. I would have thought that
this will be their next single.
The band quite often slow the
songs down, becoming near
acoustic for a large portion of the
album, allowing the singers to show
you just how good they are and
what power they're capable of.
Free fo Run is the best of these
tracks shows the blues side of the
band and you have to admit that
their diversity is admirable.
For a debut album, it's everything
that you want and shows originality
and innovation that is now so rarely
found. The easiest way to generalise
is that it is a student album through
and through, and definitely doesn't
take itself too seriously. The singers
are great, the lyrics perfect and
everything else just falls into place
around them It's at a special low
price for a limited period, make use
of it.
