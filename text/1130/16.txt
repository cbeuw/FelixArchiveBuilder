Simon Baker's Christmas TV Guide
S
herfield isn't big e n o u g h for
me. Nor is the European
Union. Not content with pro-
nouncing on those two old chest-
nuts, my opinions spill over into the
wotld of Television, and what bettet
time to foist them on you than at
Christmas. And you don't know the
sacrifices I make for this newspaper.
In order to write this article in
advance of thc publication of thc
Radio Times, I was forced to buy
the Sunday People. The Sunday
People! I'm too good to you people.
This year, I sense a greater pro-
portion of films, particularly on
BBC1, but it doesn't affect the over-
all quality of the schedules, which
are pretty good. Starting at the top,
thc Christmas Day v i e w i n g looks
pretty solid, though it should be
said that at the
time of writing,
ITV had not fully
disclosed their
film listings. Babe
(BBC1, Christmas
Eve, 6:05pm) is
definitely worth
watching, but,
good as it is, it pales into insignifi-
cance against possibly the greatest
of them all, Casablanca (BBC2,
Christmas Day,
3:10pm), just
after Her
M a j e s t y ' s
Address; Bog-
art also crops
up later in The
Maltese Fal-
con (BBC2,
Christmas Day,
12:25am). Elsewhere
Peter Sellers stars
Stretch (C4, Christmas Day, 3:15pm)
thc story of planning a perfect rob
bery. Aside
from films,
the soaps are m
ever-present-
E a s t e n d e r s
(BBC1, Christ-
mas Day, 5:35pm and 8
Coronation Street (ITV,
Day, 7:00pm) - but of more interest
is the first part of a trilogy of Men
Behaving Badly (BBC1, Christmas
Day, 9:50pm; Boxing Day, 9:35pm;
Bank Holiday M o n d a y , 9:00pm),
which will end the marvellously suc-
cessful series. A Christmas Day's
viewing would be woefully incom-
the brilliant
i Two Way
30pm) and
Christmas
plete without Morecambe and Wise,
and thankfully we ate safe this year
(BBC1, Christmas Day, 11:10pm).
Luckily, this
will not be
the only out-
ing for Eric
and Ernie.
Bring Me
S u n s h l n e -
The Life and
Death of Eric
Morecambe
( B B C 1 ,
W e d n e s d a y
23rd, 9:30pm), That Riviera Touch
(BBC1, Sunday 20th, 11:00am) and
The Magnificent Two (BBC1, Thurs-
day 24th, 12:45am) are all well
worth watching. Other titans of the
c o m e d y world are featured this
Christmas in thc flawless Heroes of
Comedy series, namely Tommy
Cooper (C4, D e c e m b e r 30th,
7:00pm) and Benny Hill (C4, N e w
Year's Eve, 8:45pm).
I expected that after last year,
the schedulers would have realised
their grave error, but bizarrely The
Italian Job is nowhere to be seen
again. All is not lost, because there
is a short feature on the making of
thc film, Mini Job (C4, Christmas
Sunday, 6:00pm); M i c h a e l Caine
fans can find further solace in thc
showing of Funeral in Berlin (BBC2,
Saturday 19th, 12:05am). Thankfully,
that other stalwart, The Sound of
Music (BBC1, Sunday 20th, 2:00pm)
is safely installed, as arc Gunfight at
the OK Corral (BBC2, Monday 21st,
4:00pm)
and The
Wizard
i of Oz
B B C 1 ,
| C h r i s t -
m a s
Sunday,
2:45pm). Bond aficionados are
unusually well catered for, with
three films, the reasonable A View
| to a Kill (ITV,
Boxing Day,
7 : 4 5 p m ) ,
G e o r g e
f a z e n b y ' s On
Her Majesty's
Secret Service
(ITV, Bank Hol-
iday M o n d a y ,
and You only Live Twice
Year's Day, 8:00pm).
Rapidly estab-
lishing itself as a
Christmas insti-
tution is the
Naked G u n
series, to wit the
s c r e e n i n g of
Naked Gun Vh-. '^g
The Smell of ^*
Fear (BBC1, Boxing Day, 11:05pm).
You've seen it a dozen times, but it
remains as fresh as the proverbial
daisy.
You would think less of me if I
did not pick out the Carry O n films
showing this Christmas. This year,
there are slightly fewer than usual,
name Carry On Again, Doctor (BBC1,
Christmas Eve, 12:40am), At Your
Boxlr Day,
2:30pm
(ITV, N e w
C o n v e n i e n c e (BBC
12:25am), |ffi>.
the excel-
lent Cleo
(ITV, Bank
H o l i d a y
M o n d a y ,
11:15pm),
G i r l s
(BBC1, W e d n e s d a y 30th, 1:35am)
and the dreadful Columbus (BBC1,
New Year's Eve, 12:35am). I shall
only be watching thc latter since I
have not yet seen it- not exactly the
strongest recommendation, I grant
you. Of undoubtedly more quality is
Perfectly Frank (BBC2, from Bank
Holiday Monday). To detail the fea-
tures of
this trib-
ute would
fill pages,
b u t
essentially
it consists
of a num-
ber of O f
Blue Eyes'
f i l m s
interspersed with five minute seg-
ments throughout thc day, in much
the same mould as the James Stew-
art tribute last year, which, in a link
worthy of Pebble Mill at O n e ,
teminds me that It's a Wonderful
Life (BBC2, Christmas Eve, 6:15pm)
should not be missed.
It may seem that I am concen-
trating mainly on films this year, but
that is because there seems at first
glance to be less in the way of
Christmas one-offs and suchlike. Of
course, we have the usual range of
specials, such as They Think it's All
Over (BBC1,
C h r i s t m a s
D a y ,
10:35pm), a
repeat of
Father Ted
(C4, Christ-
mas Eve,
9 : 3 0 p m ) ,
Have I Got
News For You (BBC2, Saturday 19th,
10:00pm), Christmas Countdown
Final (C4, Christmas Day, 4:45pm), Jo
Brand's Christmas Log (C4, Bank
11oliday Monday, 1 0:45pm) and The
Bill (IlV, Fri-
day 18th,
8:00pm), fea-
turing Leslie
G r a n t h a m
and Denise
Van Outen, an odd couple if ever
there were. Speaking of odd, there
is something by the name of Dale 'if
only I could be Larry Grayson' Win-
ton's Wonderland (BBC1, Wednes-
day 23rd, 10-.40pm). Considering the
late time of ttansmission, I shudder
to think what the content will be.
A quick flick through my notes
shows that I have forgotten a few
big films,
such as
S p e e d
(BBC1, Tues-
day 22nd,
9 : 3 0 p m ) ,
I n d e c e n t
P r o p o s a l
(BBCl, Fri-
day 18th,
9:30pm), Mrs Brown (BBCl, Christ-
mas Sunday, 8:55pm) and Nixon
mmmmm^ j ( B it c i,
" C h r i s t -
mas Sun-
d a y ,
10:00pm).
The latter
has been
w i c k e d l y
scheduled on the same night as The
Clinton Complex: How To Live With
A Dysfunctional President (BBC2,
Christmas Sunday, 8:00pm), the con-
tent of w h i c h seems pretty self-
explanatory. So there you go, that
should keep you busy over the fes-
tive season in the gaps between
pub opening hours. Eat, drink and,
well, y o u k n o w the rest. Merry
Christmas and a Happy N e w Year,
my dears.
