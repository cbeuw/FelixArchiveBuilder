ROSEMARIE TROCKEL
Whitechapel Art Gallery
T
his show, entitled Bodies of Work
1986-1998, is the first retrospective
of Rosemarie Trockel's work in
Britain for over a decade since her
famous and critically
acclaimed i:\hibilion • ' •
at the ICA. She was
recently selected to
represent Germany at
the 1999 Venice Bien-
nale.The collection is
very large with a total
of seven rooms,
each one having a
particular theme. The
first room is full of
photos and a video
that explore the rela-
tionships between
lovers. Most of the
work is in black and
white, making it very
intimate. Beauty, the
only colour print, portrays ten women
with beautiful long hair and one man
with very short hair, finally, the video is
displayed in an enclosed area. The screen
is divided up in two, with a couple in
each section. They are having a conver-
sation but most of the sentences arc in
different languages, as they repeat the
words of Warhol, Freud, Bachmann and
Marguerite Duras. The overall idea is
very bizarre but
somehow Trockel
j ; pulls it off.
The next room
is the oddest of the
whole exhibition-all
III the works here have
something to do
with eggs. Fgg wall-
paper, curtains and
shells used as ash-
trays. Trockel has
111 come up with very
imaginative ideas
that have a lovely
magical touch to
them. Another room
explores the sea; a
"5
* very clever sculpture
made of seashells and a poetic installa-
tion of a boat with slides about fisher-
men's lives projected on the sail to
brilliant effect. The following room is a
very different take on wool and Plexiglas;
it includes some very funny foam and
wool balls hanging from the ceiling, then
we're presented with a set of sketches
and drawings, some about Jackie
Kennedy. Trockel als
within the same wor
ments of drawing and
tography. In other plac
she takes a plaster hea
as a model anc
sketches different
angles of this same;
head using charcoal. I
Finally, the last room |
is a celebration of 1
Brigitte Bardot. Again
Trockel fuses all forms
of arts; a video of BB's
fans, photos and writ
ten text comparing E
and Bertolt Brecht as v
as beautiful sketches c
actress and sex icon's
Trying to make sense of such
variety is probably a vain exercise. It is
much more rewarding to consider each
room separately for its quality or imagi-
nation and then just sit back and admire
Rosemarie Trockel's art as a whole. This
is one of the most exciting and chal-
lenging exhibitions I have seen for a
while, with the artist involving the spec-
tator tremendously. She also manages
o ultra; I a very large audience
rse of the excitement
the humour of her
ork. Eclectic artists
always end up being
luminaries of their time.
We can only hope that
Trockel will continue
receiving the credit
and acclaim she so
obviously deserves.

MACBETH
Union concert Hall
T
he plight of the ill-fated Macbeth
was played out last week by IC's
drama society. The great Shake-
spearean tragedy placed the new pro-
moted Thane of Cawdor in a self-inflicted
world of deceit and treachery, with an
ominous web of prophecy contracting
and eventually consuming the flounder-
ing warrior.
Director Simon Myatt attempted to
highlight various elements of the play for
those of the technological persuasion,
dispensing with the legendary three
witches in favour of a suited trio sound-
ing out their divinations. In a bold move,
the director explained he had "discarded
some of the original themes of the play,
most notably the belief and influence of
witchcraft". Shakespeare masterfully
employed the pernicious, yet ubiquitous
supernatural presence as a linking thread
throughout the play, consequently the
witchcraft is one of the underpinning
issues and it was clear the play merely
suppressed rather than removed this
characteristic. The director "tried to com-
pensate by bringing in some new
themes" which were not immediately
apparent due to the script's integrity to
the original drama, but manifested them-
selves in the staging.
From the opening scene the cellular
phone used by one of the 'witches'
established the shift from Jacobean regal-
ity to executive officiality. Although to
some extent, it was eerie seeing the
good King Duncan sitting at a desk in a
pin-stripped suit writing next to a phone,
this peculiarity soon fades as the subtly
updated script develops. The innovation
did not stop there, with Duncan's heir
Malcolm being played by a female. This
point was not laboured, but simply pre-
the production. The pallid business cloth-
ing complemented the drama's sinister
undertones, while alluding to the
wearer's elevated social status.
Piet Mondrian's interpretation of
Trafalgar Square was the constant back-
drop for the play, firmly yet subcon-
sciously linking all that took place before
sented to the audience for their perusal
and acceptance. Often 'Shakespeare a la
1990s' productions have a tendency to
engross themselves in risky convoluted
interpretation that can mask or detract
from the original power and meaning. In
this ease a simple but effective updating
method was adopted that only added to
it with the contemporary. It added strong
flashes of colour to an otherwise overcast
stage.
The skillful use of lighting breathed
life into the production. The dominance
of the dark, contrasting with the star-
tling brilliance of the light simulated the
introspective conflicts of Macbeth as well
as his wife. It showed how the pretence
of their public life, which often took
place in the light was slowly decaying
into the darkness of their private misery.
This imagery was consummated with the
selection of music; tracks like 'Over' and
'Half Day Closing' from Portishead's sec-
ond album, the play's inspiration, filled
the Union Concert Hall with the malev-
olence of Macbeth as he invests all his
efforts into escaping the prison of
prophecy.
The performances were for the most
part sound, with particularly strong inter-
pretations from King Duncan who did
appear master of all he surveyed and
Lady Macbeth who captured the char-
acter's colossal descent from single-
minded ambition to an almost pitiful
neurosis. Macbeth was far more con-
vincing as the hallucinogenic malcontent
rather than the all-conquering jubilant
warlord.
The play presents its material well,
leaving the audience with a heartfelt
sense of sorrow although it fails to draw
them into the iniquitous world of Shake-
speare's hero and so much of the emo-
tion is lacking. The directing is highly
intelligent in places and heightens its
impact. Along with the understated con-
temporary dimension, the production
provides a laudable education.
