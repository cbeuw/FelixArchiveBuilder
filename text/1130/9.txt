o you didn't win the National Lot-
tery Superdraw no surprise there
then. But here is the story of a
woman who won the corporate equiva-
lent. Meet Barbara Cassani the Chief
Executive Officer of Go, the new low
cost airline from British
Airways. Unless you
have been living under-
ground for thc past
seven months, or you
have been so into your
course that you haven't
left the lab, you cannot
have failed to miss Go's
massive press and
poster campaign. (I've
got my own poster courtesy of a certain
jubilee line train).
So the question is what would you
do if you had £25 million to start a brand
spanking new airline? Go opened for
business on 2 April this year with six
planes and three destinations; Rome,
Milan and Copenhagen. However, it's
been no easy ride. Competition in the air-
line industry is fierce. The high fixed
costs mean that this is definitely an indus-
try for the big boys and girls. Having

invested so much to get theit businesses
off the ground the existing players are
not going to quietly walk out. The bud-
get airline market is starting to look dis-
tinctly overcrowded with companies such
as Easyjet, Dedonair, Ryanair, and Virgin
fxpressvying for passen-
gers. The extent of the
competition is demon-
strated by the fact that
Easyjet has taken legal
action against BA, accus-
ing it of cross-subsidising
Go. It is a fair bet that
five years down the line
some of the present
companies will have
been squeezed out of the market.
So what strategies is Cassani employ-
ing to ensure that Go will be a major
force in the coming years? Go is attempt-
ing to be the standard by which all other
budget airlines are measured. Its aim is
to provide an outstanding service, relia-
bility and flair in addition to the low fares.
It is also spending heavily on advertising
to create a strong brand awareness.
Hence, you see its posters blazened over
buses, underground trains and taxis.
A remarkable feature of Go is the
rapid rate of expansion it is attempting.
Since its inception earlier this year Go has
been adding new routes and new
planes, and increasing the frequency of
flights to existing routes at a bteakneck
speed. Go has more
than doubled its fleet to "...five years down
thirteen aircraft and is
intending to double its the line so me of
workforce over the next
two years. This would the present compa
challenge the manage-
ment skills of even the nieS W i
most competent execu
sure that questions will be asked.
Go is, however, very much Cassani's
baby. She was BA's General Manager in
thc United States when in May of last
year she was offeted the chance to
develop a business plan for a new low-
cost airline operating out
of Stanstcd. from her
experience in the States,
where she had wit-
nessed the large opera-
tors ignoring the new
lost-cost airlines until
have been they had taken a signifi-
cant chunk of the market
tive. Apart from manag-
ing thc new staff
members and the inevitable teething
problems of expanding any business
there is the question of finance. You had
better get your cash flow projections
right when operating in such a capital
intensive business. Cassani is fortunate
that instead of relying on bank finance
she is answerable to BA, who obviously
have a greater understanding of the air-
line business. However, targets are tar-
gets no matter who is providing the
finance. If they are not met you can be
squeezed out..." share, she knew some
of thc mistakes to avoid.
Therefore, she accepted the offer on thc
proviso that if the show did get on the
runway she would run it. She has been
involved in every aspect of Go from the
detail of thc cabin crew uniforms lo
developing thc Go corporate identity
and ethos. The fotmer management con-
sultant and big company executive has
got the job most managers would dream
of; running their own company. In that
sense she is as fortunate as any Super-
draw winner.
Presidential Talk-Back
• was going to talk about thc pticc of
I Imperial College's catering today,
I but something far more controver-
sial has come up.
First some background. The Con-
stituent College Unions (CCUs) have
traditionally had certain clubs and soci-
eties under their wings. Some of these
have been seen as appropriate for
example a CCU sports team, but oth-
ers less so. All of the other clubs and
societies of the Union are looked after
by a Club and Societies Committee
(CSC) of which there are six, based on
the type of club or society they are (for
example athletic or recreational).
The problem has been that over
recent years (possibly due to thc
demise of the CCUs themselves or just
the inappropriate position of these
clubs) the clubs and societies of the
CCUs have not been run as effectively
as those in CSCs. This taises quite a
few issues.
As a sabbatical it is extremely frus-
trating for clubs or societies to either
lose money, not follow financial pro-
cedures or put us in positions where
something has to be done immedi-
ately, because of a
lack of planning,
taking up a gteat
deal of our time
that could be
avoided, the othet
issue is Health and
Safety. As Presi-
dent of the Union I
am ultimately
responsible fot thc
health and safety
of every student
that takes part in a
Union activity.
the CCUs slow
up the flow of
information from
and to the Union,
and this results in
major problems.
Financial responsi-
bility forms are not
signed, subs not paid in, events not
properly planned and as a result the
clubs and societies are not run as
effectively as they could be.
One concern of the CCUs is the
loss of identity of the clubs if they are
David Hellard, ICU President
financially con-
trolled by the
CSCs, which could
cause a drop in
participation, but
quite the reverse
is true. Effectively
run clubs will be
more successful,
their money will
go further, theit
events better and
this will encourage
participation, lift-
ing the image of
thc; CCUs, some-
i thing thai is so
d e s p e r a t e l y
needed. Remov-
ing control of thc
I inane es ol the
clubs and societies
from the CCUs
does not severe the links between
them. They will still have thc same
membctship, alumni, traditions and
input into the CCUs if they so desire
A very worrying aspect of the clubs
and societies being under the control
of the CCUs is that we have no idea if
they have done risk assessments, if
they are following thc health and
safety policy or if they ate taking ade-
quate precautions. I am not happy
being responsible for clubs or soci-
eties activities when I have very little
control over their health and safety.
Undet CSCs this is not a major prob-
lem.
If the CCUs ate to survive in thc
future they will need participation at
the grass root level which can filtct up,
and the most obvious way to do this
is through their clubs and societies. If
these continue to cause problems with
health and safety and arc not effec-
tively run they will die and with them
the CCUs. Wc ate offering them a life-
line, please take it.
Now it's your chance to have your
say. Send me an email about your
views (president@ic.ac.uk), as it will
be coming up at Council in the future,
and could be passed as policy to move
them al! in time for this year's budgets,
in february.
Happy Christmas, and I hope to
see you all refreshed in the new year.
