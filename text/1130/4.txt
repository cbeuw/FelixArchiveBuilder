IC Researchers Test Killer Cure
A major battle has been won in the
ongoing war against meningitis. It
appears that scientists in Cuba have suc-
ceeded in eradicating the killer infec-
tion that previously plagued the
population of the island.
The team has developed a cure for
the strain of meningitis B that infects
2,000 people each year and kills 200 of
those. Thc symptoms appear flu-like,
but can rapidly result in death as IC expe-
rienced first hand earlier this term with
the tragic death of a first year medic.
The infection afflicted Cuba in thc
1980s, when epidemics had a particularly
devastating effect amongst children,
killing hundreds every year and leaving
others crippled or maimed. Since the
1959 revolution Cuba has invested in
education, healthcare and science, and
is now the only country with a national

vaccination programme. Mass immuni-
sation has resulted in an astounding
transformation and the scientists have
almost exterminated meningitis B, with
now only three cases per million people,
a tenth of the British equivalent.
An IC team has been sent to Cuba
in order to assess the vaccine and the
immunity it provides. Their work was fea-
tured in last Wednesday's 'Tomorrow's
World' programme where Professor Mike
Levin, Head of Paediatrics, stated "a
British Research team in Havana is cur-
rently studying the data gathered on
results before and after vaccination, so
that only a relatively short time would be
needed for tests in this country." Thc
team, funded by the Meningitis Research
Foundation, will appraise its pertinence
in thc development of a British vaccine.
Dr Michael Levin, the UK team leader
commented "All our team working on
the intensive care unit would like noth-
ing better than to see another child rid
of this disease." Their results are due for
a 1999 release.
Unfortunately the Cuban vaccine is
obsolete in Britain as explained by the
medical officet for the Meningitis
Research Foundation, Linda Glennie: "In
the 1980s Cuba had a big problem with
meningococcal disease which it appears
to have solved. The situation in the UK
is more complicated because we have
many different types of B strain. How-
ever, we hope that this research project
will provide vital clues which will enable
scientists to develop a vaccine against B
strain which accounts for about 60% of
cases of the disease in this country."

Back Beat Busted CCU dubs Come Home?
By Sanjay Sikdar
Six months of surveillance on the Back
Beat Club on Denmark Place culminated
in police storming the notorious drug
den, on Tuesday 1 December.
A large proportion of the club's clien-
tele were tourists. Instead of code
words, to gain entry it was only necessary
to purchase a £2.00 laminated mem-
bership card. Once through the
armoured entrance guarded by 4 - 5
heavyweight custodians one would find
However, at around 5.30pm, the tran-
quillity of the inhabitants was shattered
in the most dramatic manner. Police
stormed the drug fortress by abseiling
through the roof, negating the steel
doors with stun grenades. Club goers at
the time were clearly distressed by the
efficiency of the execution of the raid.
Some managed to discard the offending
articles, but all were caught by the heav-
ily armed team. As one Kings student
present at the time said; "They [police]
told us to get down on the fucking floor,
many of us just sat there blissed out, we

the bar on the first floor with pool and
chill-out rooms on the level above. How-
ever, it was the third floor that supplied
the club with its infamy. By handing your
money to a man sitting there, you would
take your £10 or £20 plastic bag of
cannabis ftom a letterbox in the wall
without ever seeing the identity of the
person working in the background. Peo-
ple were 'splitting up' openly whilst some
would watch the televisions in the bar in
a zombie like state. One IC regular
described the club as "A really good
place as it has a really good atmosphere
and everyone's relaxed and friendly".

were brutally restrained with plastic hand-
cuffs. There was just dead silence as
they pointed the guns at us and read out
the search warrant. Next there were the
uniformed Metropolitan police, with two
officers searching each person."
Senior plain clothed policemen later
questioned the clubbers further. So far
thc confiscated haul stands at £100,000
of cannabis and £70,000 in cash. This,
coupled with thc fact that no Class A
drugs or firearms have been discovered
has somewhat tempered thc initial
euphoria that had accompanied the raid.

Imperial College Union President Dave
Hellard surprised last week's ICU Coun-
cil meeting with his controversial pro-
posal to change the way in which
Constituent College Union clubs are run.
Mr Hellard has suggested that all
RSM, C&G, RCS and ICSM Union clubs
s h o u l d
move from
CCU to ICU
control, to
"ensure bet-
ter commu-
n i c a t i o n ,
more finan-
cial respon-
sibility and
more con-
tact with the
c h a i t " .
Under the %/t
plans that - n .
he outlined
at the meet-
ing, all clubs
(with thc exception of Departmental
Societies and mascotry) would move
into the relevant Clubs & Societies Com-
mittee. Ptedominantly, this will affect
CCU sports teams, who would thus move
into the Athletics Clubs Committee.
Whilst C&G, RSM and the RCS only stand
to lose a handful of clubs between them,
the Med School will see a large number
of clubs, representing a wide range of
interests, move out of their control.
Whilst many of thc CCU reps present
at the meeting criticised the suggestion,
on thc basis that it would lead to thc
diminishing of participation in the CCUs,
Mr Hellard countered that it would lead
to the strengthening of the clubs, as
they would move closer to like-minded
societies; "It's very hard to compare club
success and budgets when thay aren't
surrounded by clubs with similar inter-
ests". Speaking in response to one del-
egate's suggestion that this ptoposal
would only "punish the best clubs for
the behaviour of thc worst", Mr Hellard
noted that "the CSC system is proven - it
works".
Mr Hel-
lard was
keen to
point out
that this pro-
posal is not
designed to
alter mem-
bership or
b u d g e t s .
Club activity
need not
change, and
in fact the
a v e r a g e
m e m b e r
would not
notice any difference; "It won't change
the status of the club in any way - just the
way they arc administered".
With a lot of work still to do before
he can produce any concrete proposals,
Mr Hellard was keen to point out that this
proposal has only been brought forward
for discussion. Nevertheless, it is one
which has awakened very strong feelings
amongst certain CCU figures. Eventu-
ally, however, Council finally agreed that
Mr Hellard should return with more solid
proposals in the new year. Anyone who
wishes to express their view on the sub-
ject should contact Dave Hellard at pres-
ldent@lc.ac.uk.
