Fishy Finances
T
ime flies by when you're the driver
of a train or, for that matter, a hum-
ble wordsmith. Without so much
as a by-your-leave, Christmas is upon us,
which means a couple of weeks holiday
for you lot. I'll try to get out of the lab for
ten minutes to watch Her Majesty's
address and have a sherry and mince pie,
so remember those less fortunate etc. All
in all, it has been a fairly busy term, with
the usual melange of triumphs, cock-
ups and outrages. The BMS was opened,
but not finished, and is undoubtedly a
major asset to the College. Not sure
about the heavy duty plasterwork, capa-
ble of withstanding everything save for
Blutak and paper, now you mention it.
We've had more elections than Italy, less
consultation of the populace than North
Korea and as much petty bureaucracy as
Brussels. Another typical chapter in the
Great Imperial Story.
Last week's Felix raised a few inter-
esting points, though whether Suzanne
Agrain's letter falls into that category is
not for me to say. I shall limit myself to
saying that some of the figures I quoted
from the World Bank were taken from
UN sources, undermining her point, but
since this has all the hallmarks of a very
tedious slanging match, I shall say no
more, assured in the knowledge that I
am right and she's wrong. That's
quashed that one, eh Simon? Much
more worrying is the news that the STA
Accademic travel agency is being
replaced. I have no particular loyalty to
the incumbents, though it would be
interesting to know why they were
deemed unsuitable to continue. The
concern stems from the Union's isolation
from the whole episode. Given ICU's
financial dependence on this outlet, this
is worrying, particularly the fact that the
Union Manager was denied access to
important paperwork associated with the
matter.
A less charitable soul than myself
would suggest that the smell of Siberian
hamster was on the breeze. Exclusion of
sabbaticals, because they're just stu-
dents, is understandable if one consid-
ers the Sherfield mindset. Don't get me
wrong, it's disgraceful and hypocritical,
when we consider how superbly they
manage their affairs, but I have a nasty
suspicion that marginalisation of ICU is
not the College's main aim. It seems
more like an attempt to claw back JCR
refurbishment money denied, quite
rightly, by the Union at the time. In other
words, the chances of the Union's share
of the rent being the same after this deal
are slim to zero. The time and effort
wasted on this trifling issue at the high-
est level in Sherfield is laughable. The JCR
funding is and always was a matter for
the College; if one extended the ludi-
crous principle, woufd ICU be expected
to pay for refurbishment of the Great
Hall, given that it is used at times by stu-
dents? The provider of travel services at
Imperial is irrelevant as long as the ser-
vice is competitive and reliable, but this
all looks a bit fishy. I hope I am proved
wrong, but don't hold your breath.
Health Centre Disgrace
W
hen I joined Imperial shortly
after the War, I resolved to reg-
ister with the Health Centre.
However, since I bother the medical pro-
fession as often as your average turkey
invites Bernard Matthews round for
mince pies, I have still yet to fill in the
forms. However, I recently heard mum-
blings in the SCR about the cessation of
a full service on a Tuesday afternoon.
Were you
aware of this?
Did anyone
tell you? Of
course not,
you're only
students/
staff/First Aid
coordina-
tors/Heads of
Department. I
first heard of
it because of
a fairly serious
accident in
Biochemistry,
which was
unnecessarily
delayed by
confusion
over a new
policy that
nobody out-
side the
Health Centre
appeared to have heard of. This in itself
is disgraceful. In an organisation such as
Imperial, where the smallest detail has to
be dissected by an endless stream of
committees and steering groups, it
seems inconceivable that such a vitally
important policy change can go through
with seemingly no recourse to anyone
else in College. So, you ask, how do the
overburdened people in the Health Cen-
tre want to use the time made available
by this alteration? Health education? Non-
emergency treatment, such as the pro-
vision of immunisations for foreign
travel? Don't be daft. Administration and
meetings. We now have a substandard,
ill-defined medical service on Tuesday
afternoons in order that they can push
paper around. This is an intolerable sit-
uation, which calls into question the usu-
ally sound judgement of those involved.
The correct solution has three stages.
Firstly, don't have an accident on Tues-
day afternoons. Secondly, inform all the
relevant people of the exact procedures,
so delays are avoided when dealing with
casualties, finally, scrap this stupid idea
and get back to running a proper service,
for which a huge amount of money has
been spent in the last lew years. With
rumours about the withdrawal of cer-
tain services provided for College staff,
it is time people on this side of Exhibition
Road took a look at those on the other.
Leave the Lords Alone
I
t may have escaped your notice, but
this has not been a good few weeks
for the Conservative Party. Things
were going so well, and then we had the
Cranbornc incident, to cut a long story
short, the Government was offered a
compromise involving the retention of
ninety-one hereditary peers until the
mystical Stage
Simon Baker exchange for
an agreement
not to scupper
Labour's
whole legisla-
tive pro-
gramme.
Viscount Cran-
borne made a
number of
errors, both in
his suggestion
and approach,
for which he
was rightly crit-
icised. As for
sacking,
William Hague
was in the
perfect catch-
22. His only
real failing
was bringing
up the whole subject, rather than con-
tinuing the attack on Europe. I imagine
he may do things differently if history
repeats itself.
Lord Cranborne's offer was far too
generous. The Conservative peers would
never stall all of the Government's leg-
islation, since it would breach the Salis-
bury Convention, which prevents the
obstruction by the Upper House of a
manifesto-pledged bill. Secondly, his
compromise runs the risk of removing all
serious debate from the last chamber
prepared to challenge the idea that Tony
Blair has papal infallibility. The debate to
date has been too narrow, and has
missed some very important aspects. For
a start everyone assumes that the Lords
must be reformed. This is a generalisa-
tion, but if the popular will is behind
reform (most people couldn't care less),
let us look at the bones of contention.
Leaving aside the overarching class war
politics of certain Labour MPs, the main
Voice of Reason
irritation seems to be the perceived
inbuilt Tory majority caused by the hered-
itary members, which is occasionally
exercised by dragging old duffers out of
the woodwork in order to block a Gov-
ernment bill. This problem, in principle,
is easy to solve. Minimum attendance
and voting requirements should be
established, thus preventing peers
appearing once a decade when
instructed to. If you discard those hered-
itary peers who have no interest in vot-
ing on a regular basis, the majority for
the most part disappears.
The House of Lords is principally a
revising chamber, rendering it very dif-
ferent from the primary legislative body.
In order to strengthen this further, the
party whip system could be removed
from the Lords. Some feel that the press-
ganging of Honourable Members dam-
ages its credibility, and so such a move
would help to address this point. I don't
feel that cither is particularly necessary,
but both suggestions are more con-
structive than the damage currently
being wreaked on this country by Blair
and his cronies. At the end of the day,
the Lords' biggest failing is that of tradi-
tion. It does not sit comfortably with this
Cool Britiannia rubbish, so must be
'rebranded.1
Trouble is, it looks like He'll
get away with it, because the strength of
our parliamentary system is that it does-
n't adversely affect people's lives. If
things were bad, people would take
notice. Oh, to be Italian...
And Finally.
M
any of you know that I have
had a enormous bee in my
bonnet of late, namely the
polythene wrapper stuck in a tree by
the Central Library. It arrived there about
two years ago, and has survived wind,
rain and snow. I expected that it would
be removed in the run-up to the Royal
Visit. Alas, while the budget for Chinese
granite and exotic bedding plants
approached that for missiles in the US,
there was no money left for a bloke
with a long stick.
It has now, however, miraculously
disappeared. It can't just have fallen from
its perch, it must have been pushed (or
pulled), and only one man could be
responsible for this, lan Caldwell. If you
were that man, then congratulations are
in order, otherwise we have a mystery
character intent on Campus Renaissance,
albeit on a smaller scale. I shall muse on
this over the turkey this Christmas and
give you an answer in the New Year. On
that note, have a Happy Christmas, watch
a few programmes recommended by
that bloke Baker elsewhere in this august
journal and, if the Devil drives, have a
quick flick through those lecture notes.
See you in '99.
