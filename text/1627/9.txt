I
f you expect nothing from
anybody,” writes Sylvia
Plath in The Bell Jar, “you’re
never disappointed.” Such
a statement may seem bleak, but
the idea that expectation is the
mother of all dissatisfactions is
only confirmed by A Bigger Splash,
Luca Guadagnino’s much-awaited
return to our screens that – while
entertaining and well-made – fails
to fulfil this reviewer’s hopes.
Guadagnino first burst onto
the international scene in 2009,
garnering wide acclaim for I Am
Love, a sumptuous piece of work
centring around an industrial
Milanese family; Tilda Swinton
gave a magnetic performance as the
Russian-born matriarch of the clan,
desperately watching her family fall
apart whilst entering into a tryst
with her son’s friend. And now,
seven years on, Guadagnino is back,
and has brought Swinton along for
the ride, in his remake of Jacques
Deray’s 1969 work La Piscine.
Swinton is Marianne Lane, a
world-touring, glitter-coated rock
star, presumably based on a Bowie
archetype. Following an injury to
her vocal cords, she has retreated
to a private villa in the Strait of
Sicily for rest and relaxation, with
her long-term boyfriend Paul
in tow (Matthias Schoenaerts).
Unfortunately, they are tracked
down by Harry (Ralph Fiennes), a
record producer and old flame of
Marianne’s; he brings along newly-
discovered daughter, Penelope
(Dakota Johnson), and they settle
down to an uneasy holiday.
All four leads are excellent in their
roles. As perhaps the only character
who could possibly be construed
as ‘realistic’, Schoenaerts brings a
sense of groundedness to his Paul.
Swinton faces a challenging role
in that Marianne can for the most
part only communicate in whispers,
but as usual her immense physical
presence comes to the fore. As
Harry, Fiennes dominates all the
scenes he’s in – dancing around the
living room to The Rolling Stones,
diving naked into the pool, nearly
driving his car over a cliff; whenever
he enters the frame it become ‘The
Harry Show’. Continuing on from
his star-turn in Wes Anderson’s
Grand Budapest Hotel, A Bigger
Splash sees Fiennes expanding his
oeuvre into broad comedy.
But the real discovery here is
Dakota Johnson, best known
thus far for her work in the
flaccid Fifty Shades adaptation; as
Penelope she radiates a true sexual
charisma, mixing the ingénue
and the deviant in a chimerical
beast of a role. Manipulative and
devious, the interactions between
her and Marianne bring to mind
the sparring between Charlotte
Rampling and Ludivine Sagnier in
Francois Ozon’s Swimming Pool,
another psychosexual drama deeply
indebted to Deray.
Guadagnino carries over some of
the trademark features that left their
mark on I Am Love: his creeping use
of the slow-zoom shot; frequent
jump-cuts; and his propensity to
have food stand in for dialogue.
While the latter technique fitted in
quite well with the plot of his last
film (Swinton’s character’s lover
is a chef), here there are instances
where it is (figuratively) over-egged.

A Bigger Splash fails to make an impact
Despite the best efforts of Swinton and co, Luca Guadagnino's latest dissapoints
pure white ricotta, Harry handling
a grotesquely oversized hunk of
parmesan at a tense dinner. In fact,
one of Penelope’s first actions is to
peel and bite into a ripe fig in a way
that would make Angela Carter
blush.
The island setting, too, feels like a
misstep. A barren island that admits
no beauty, A Bigger Splash resists
the best efforts of cinematographer
Yorick Le Saux; there are some
beautiful scenes shot at night or
sunset, but in all the daytime scenes
the hot Mediterranean sun bleaches
all life out of the film. It’s another
unfortunate contrast to I Am Love,
on which Le Saux also worked;
while that film manages to capture
the frantic energy of Milan and the
sun-dappled splendour of Sanremo,
with A Bigger Splash he can only
do so much with the setting.
Furthermore, there is the bizarre
choice to set all the action against
a backdrop of the current European
refugee crisis: towards the middle of
the film we start to hear news reports
of drownings near Lampedusa, and
Penelope is ogled by a group of men
during a hike into the mountains
(it is perhaps worth pointing out
that they are the only non-white
characters encountered in the
film, and have no lines). It is very
unclear what point this is supposed
to serve. Are we supposed to feel
amused at the irrelevant worries
of the rich and famous being cast
into shadow by ‘real’ struggles? Or
are the characters supposed to be
psychologically trapped, just as the
refugees are physically detained?
The overall effect is just to leave a
sense of confusion on the screen,
and a bad taste in our mouths.
Standing on its own, A Bigger
Splash is a solid film; competently
directed, well acted, and – despite
certain missteps – delivering a
powerful psychological impact.
However, given Guadagnino's last
film, it comes as a disappointment.
I Am Love was like a beautifully
presented plate in a Michelin-star
restaurant – sumptuous, vibrant,
and delectable. In contrast, A Bigger
Splash is much like the volcanic rock
upon which it is set – unnerving,
hostile, and ultimately desolate.
F
rancis Ford Coppola’s
Godfather films (excluding
The Godfather III – no one
likes the third one, let’s
be real) are often considered to be
two of the greatest films ever made.
In fact, they sit nicely below The
Shawshank Redemption’s top spot
on IMDb’s Top 100 Films list.
However, The Godfather is not the
be-all and end-all. One must never
forget that the ‘gangster film’ genre
is rich in quality, and can branch out
from the standard mid-1900s Mafia
setting:
Once Upon a Time in
America (1984)
Once Upon a Time in America is
the first in the trilogy of films by
Sergio Leone, which also contains
the classic Once Upon a Time in
the West. The fact that this feature
follows the entire lives of a group of
Jewish ghetto youths and their rise
to power in New York means that
it is notoriously long. I’ll be straight
though, unless you’ve experienced
the 251 minute extended director’s
cut you have no right to complain
about the length.
Reservoir Dogs (1992)
Tarantino’s feature-length debut
movie – and, in my opinion, one
of his best – is an intricate, stylish,
theatrical story set almost entirely
in one location. The film is such a
classic and many of its scenes so
iconic that it’s likely you’ve already
had countless Tarantino fanboys
insist you watch it already. Why in
God’s name haven’t you then?
Hard Boiled (1992)
Asian crime dramas are the
spiritual cousins to the classic
American Mafioso film. Be it an
artistic and violent Yakuza drama or
gritty 90s Hong Kong action romp,
the Eastern film industry has many
contenders for critic’s top spots.
Hard Boiled focuses on tough-as-
nails cop Yun-Fat Chow drives the
narrative.For reference,Body count:

Doc corner: ExitThrough the Gift Shop
Ben Collier
Film Writer
L
ast week we had The
Imposter – a gripping
documentary following
a bizarre case of identity
fraud and murder. The film was
heavy with recreation scenes and
utilised them to such an extent
that it blurred the lines between
documentary and feature drama.
The documentary of choice this
week continues the theme of mixing
reality and fiction. The difference
here is that it's kind of the point.
In reality, Exit Through the Gift
Shop may not even be allowed to
feature in this section, as it’s not
really clear if it can really be called a
‘documentary’.
The narrative presented to us
(should we take the film’s word
for it) is that an eccentric amateur
filmmaker Thierry Guetta set out to
locate and document a number of
popular street artists, including the
controversial graffiti artist Banksy.
Guetta was interested in filming
the creative process, – telling many
prominent ‘street artists’ that he
is making a feature documentary
when, in reality, he has no intention
of editing his footage.Banksy,as I’m
sure you know, is a fan of anonymity
and as it turns out eventually turns
the cameras back on Thierry.
In the end Banksy is credited as
the director of this film, taking the
creative reigns to tell his own story
with Guetta’s supposed ‘mountain
of video cassettes’ to hand. The
final parts of the film describe how
Banksy convinces Thierry himself
to become a street artist under the
title of ‘Mr. Brainwash’. ‘M.B.W.’
goes onto make millions off the
oh-so-trendy art crowd of LA. The
issue here is how much of this story
we believe, and personally, I don’t
believe any of it. In this way, whilst
the documentation of the other
street artists is factual, Banksy quite
clearly fabricated this character of
Guetta to tell his own story. I’m
just not massively interested in
debating its legitimacy.
To the film’s credit, there is
a nice blend of sweet and sour
here with humour and political
satire both featuring heavily. The
film shines in its first act which
gives us the backstory of various
prominent street artists such
as ‘Space Invader’ and Shepard
Fairey. Also interesting is how
the film explores the idea that the
most important thing in the art
world is not the quality of your
pieces but rather your ability to
create hype. Banksy, through this
character of Guetta, exposes how
comfortably commercial street
art has become.
The fact remains that he’s so
unfathomably annoying that
you’ll want to reach into your
TV and strangle him by the third
act. If Banksy makes another film
without the pretentious nonsense
or over-complications, I’ll make
sure to give it a watch.
Deadpool
Dir: Tim Miller. Script: Rhett
Reese,Paul Wernick.Starring: Ryan
Reynolds, Morena Baccarin, Gina
Carano,T. J. Miller. 108 minutes.
C
ritics have been
predicting comic book
movie fatigue ever since
Marvel’s The Avengers
back in 2012, yet audiences are
turning out in droves to increasingly
stale comic based blockbusters.
Many had hoped that Deadpool,
the eighth installment in the
X-Men series and the directorial
debut of Tim Miller, would provide
something radically new.The source
material from which it could have
borrowed is vast and diverse, but
writers Rhett Reese and Paul
Wernick have instead delivered
a formulaic origin story and a
forgettable villain. Whilst it might
begin mid-action, it spends far too
much time in flashbacks to the
protagonist's past: Wade Wilson, a
mercenary for hire, unlocks mutant
powers in an attempt to cure his
terminal cancer and becomes
Deadpool. The film follows his
attempts to hunt down the man who
disfigured and tortured him in an
experimental weapons programme.
Ryan Reynolds, who plays the
titular antihero, gives a performance
that perfectly captures Deadpool’s
wacky sensibilities. The ensemble
cast, however are mixed: as
Weasel, Wilson’s best friend, T.
J. Miller plays the same character
he plays in HBO’s Silicon Valley;
Morena Baccarin provides much
needed romance as Vanessa, and
her relationship with Wilson,
although accelerated (through a
sequence of interesting sex scenes),
is surprisingly believable for a
comic book film. Two lesser-known
X-Men make welcome appearances
in the film: Colossus (Stefan
Kapičić) and Negasonic Teenage
Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand),
providing counter-balance to
Deadpool’s crude humour.
Comics readers will know that
Wade Wilson can be a complex and
interesting character; unfortunately,
Deadpool offers none of this.
Unnecessarily obscene, always dark,
and never clever, the self-aware
comedy and repeated breaking of the
fourth wall are an attempt to appeal
to the worst kind of demographic.
Full of obscure references and
awful jokes about topics ranging
from genitals to murder, Deadpool
is nothing more than the Reddit of
movies.
