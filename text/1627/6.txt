Fishballs to bullets – that escalated quickly
Hong Kong is going through a tumultuous period of civil unrest, but what were the
real reasons behind the latest outbreaks of violence?

H
ong Kong experienced
a fiery Chinese New
Year as protesters and
the police clashed on
the night of the 7th
of February.
With 130 people injured and 67
people arrested, one might be
surprised to find out that the riots
started with fishballs,a popular local
snack that could be bought from
street vendors.
During the Chinese New Year,
as many restaurants close early,
some streets become informal food
markets, populated by hawkers
that sell curry fishballs, imitation
shark’s fin soup, and other street
foods. Many of these hawkers are
doing business illegally, as they
haven’t obtained a licence from the

Department (FEHD).In fact,a vast
majority of Hong Kong’s hawkers
are illegal as new hot food licences
haven’t been distributed since 1980,
due to difficulties in managing the
safety and cleanliness of the food
stalls.
The FEHD are known to be
rather lax regarding these offences
during the Chinese New Year, as
the informal markets are traditional
during this holiday. However, this
year, the FEHD decided that New
Year’s Eve would be a prime time
to enforce the regulations. The
news spread and groups organised
protests on social media against the
FEHD in the Mong Kok area.
The FEHD were helpless against
large groups of protesters, and the
police were called in, leading to
a standoff between the two sides.
Violent clashes broke out and the
city descended into darkness and
chaos. The violent protesters threw
bricks and other items at the police,
physically assaulted officers, and set
cars and mounds of trash alight.
On the flip side, police officers
were using pepper spray, attacking
protesters with their batons, and
throwing bricks back towards the
crowd. Members of the press were
also injured in the skirmishes. The
night climaxed with gunshots,
fired towards the sky by a traffic
police officer, and as the sun rose
the protesters retreated. In the days
that followed, people were arrested
for rioting and obtaining access to a
computer with intent to commit an
offence or with a dishonest intent.
The night left the city in shock.
As politicians awoke, parties
began to swiftly condemn the
violence. Government officials
stated that the riots had nothing
to do with localist movements, the
government’s approval rating, or
hawker regulations. Supporters of
the protest condemned the police
force’s actions with others coming
to the support of the police force,
saying that the police were, in fact,
too restrained.
Supporters of the protest zero
in on the fact that fishballs led
to bullets and police brutality,
while those against looked at the
injuries sustained by the force and
the helplessness of some under-
equipped officers.
Pulling the camera back, we see
that the clashes escalated step-by-
step and the violence from both sides
was irrational and unreasonable.But
more importantly, the fishballs were
just the final straw for the protestors,
pushing them towards violence. We
are looking at a city that has slowly
but surely fallen from its place as the
number one international financial
centre in Asia to a political mess
with a steadily worsening economic
issues. Sure, this may be the result
of the rapidly growing Chinese
economy and changes in the socio-
political environment, but the
government is not without fault.
The executive branch of Hong
Kong has no accountability to
the general public, because it is
appointed by a small group of
electors. The Legislative Council is
controlled by the pro-establishment
parties, with 30 out of 70 of the seats
being functional constituencies,
allowing small groups to have
immense voting power. Time after
time, the Hong Kong government
has continued to push unwanted
policies, heedless of public outcry.
Some examples include: The
Mainland and Hong Kong
Closer Economic Partnership
Arrangement, The National
Education issue, the police response
to Occupy Central, the shameful
faux universal suffrage plan, the
attempted implementation of
simplified Chinese and Mandarin
as the main language for education,
the missing booksellers incident,the
forced appointment of the Hong
Kong University Council chairman,
the push for the Copyright
(Amendment) Bill 2014 are all
examples of enforced policies for
the interested reader.
But Government officials believe
that this Fishball Riot has nothing
to do with their actions? They may
be acting clueless now, but let’s
dispel once and for all the fiction
that the Hong Kong government
doesn’t know what it’s doing. It
knows exactly what it’s doing.
They are undertaking an effort to
change the city, and to make it more
like China. A significant portion
of the public (particularly the
younger generation) are tired of the
mainlanders flooding the streets of
Tsim Sha Tsui, buying up property
and causing baby formula shortages
while the government does nothing
but encourage them. Something
needs to change, and in my opinion,
the first step would be to remove
the system of electors and institute
universal suffrage.
No one is saying that true
universal suffrage would solve every
problem in the city and make it a
magical fairy land with a 420%
GDP growth per year and a happy
population. However it would make
the government accountable to its
people,and perhaps these seemingly
thoughtless actions, and the riots
that follow, would happen less
often.
