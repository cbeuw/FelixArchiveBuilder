R
BS last week announced
the results from a
Facebook poll (welcome
to the future folks)
whereby the mathematician and
astronomer, Mary Somerville, was
chosen by the people of Scotland to
be the face of the £10 note for the
foreseeable future. And yes, since
Scottish money is legal tender in
England, that means a new face will
be on the funny looking notes that
momentarily confuse you every now
and then at the ATM. Personally I
think it’s a solid choice considering
thatbyallaccounts,MarySomerville
was a textbook scientific badass.
Despite showing great intelligence
from a young age, Somerville’s
education was largely informal and
partially self-taught due to the social
conventions restricting her from
higher education. The restrictions
placed upon her only worsened after
the death of her 10 year-old sister,
which her parents blamed on Mary’s
determination to be educated.
Regardless of these hurdles
Somerville became a respected name
in the scientific community as an
adult, her translations and original
works about astronomy becoming
widely popular. She became the
first female member of the Royal
Astronomical Society and her work
was instrumental in predicting the
presence of the 9th
planet, Neptune
in our solar system. On top of
all that, Somerville continued to
fulfil the expectations of a well-
connected socialite, supported
women’s suffrage and was one of
the most influential science writers
of her time.
Mary Somerville may be the
first female scientist to appear on
a Scottish banknote, but when it
comes to representation, scientists
do quite well for themselves. To
name just a few…
Charles Darwin
Ok we’re starting off with the easy
one; Darwin is the only scientist
to be featured on a note currently
in circulation, as well as being the
most famous biologist of all time.
However, none of this could have
been predicted when he initially
boarded The Beagle. Darwin had
not completed his studies and
therefore was taken on as a self-
funded secondary naturalist for
the journey, with the ship’s doctor
holding the role official. Even his
father considered the trip a waste
of time. Darwin and his majestic
beard are gracing our tenners aat
the moment and have been there
since the turn of the millennium.
However,the prolific regency author
Jane Austen is scheduled to replace
Mary Somerville, a scientific badass in astronomy and mathematics, proposed to be the new face of the Scottish £10. Photo Credit: wikipedia

Scientists who made bank
In honour of Mary Somerville appearing on the new RBS £10 note, FELIX
explores which other scientists have previously been represented, and asks who’s
next?
Darwin and his Finches in 2017
Isaac Newton
Physicist, mathematician and
noted apple tree enthusiast,
Newton, whose work in the 17th
century wrote the rules of physics,
classical mechanics, and a bunch
of other stuff I don’t understand.
His seemingly endless list of
achievements include, formulating
the laws of motion, building the
first reflecting telescope, creating
the theory of gravity, and correctly
predicting that the earth was an
obligate spheroid. A lesser known
role is the fact that Newton served
as warden of the Royal Mint, or
“Master of the Mint” for 30 years.
It’s quite fitting then that Newton’s
face was stamped on all one pound
notes from 1978 until 1988, when
the switch to coins sadly took
him and his fancy telescope out of
circulation forever.
Florence Nightingale
I’m counting the lady of the lamp
on this list because her revolution
of nursing was down to applying
simple scientific principle to medical
practices. In addition , Nightingale
was a talented statistician and
the first female inducted into the
Royal Statistical Society. One of
the hallmarks of Nightingale’s
career were sanitary reforms, after
demonstrating with stats that a lack
of sanitation was directly linked to
mortality rates in rural India. Based
on her findings, she continued to
lobby for social reforms to improve
hygiene in Britain and abroad.
Nightingale later set up a Nursing
School and wrote multiple books on
her methods of care, some of which
are still used today. Much like Mary
Somerville, Nightingale also found
time to be a pioneering feminist,
writing a series of essays on female
independence. Literature critic
Elaine Showalter dubbed the most
famous of these essays “Cassandra”,
a “major text of English feminism”.
Florence Nightingale was on the
£10 note for 19 years before being
replaced by Charles Dickens.
As for future nominees for the
honour of being on the other side of
the Queen’s face, my personal picks
are…
Ada Lovelace
Why? Easy. Lovelace was a
charismatic mathematician and
widely considered to be the first
computer programmer, writing
the first algorithm designed to
be performed by a machine.
Additionally, Lovelace was close
friends with and was tutored by
Somerville. These women both
being on currency money together
would be a triumph for the scientific
sisterhood.
J.J. Thompson
Why? Aside from having a
cool name and excellent facial
hair, Thompson was a as a genius
physicist who won a Nobel prize for
discovering the electron in 1906.He
was also a gifted teacher, inspiring
many famous pupils including
Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr
who would go on to make major
discoveries in physics as well.

T
wo black holes merged
billions of light
years away, causing
a ripple in the fabric
of spacetime big enough to be
measured by scientists at the LIGO
Collaboration. The results provide
further support for Einstein’s theory
of general relativity.
The 4km long interferometers
at LIGO simultaneously detected
a disturbance in their lasers
signifying the passing of a massive
gravitational wave through the
Earth. The measurements suggest
the black hole collision released a
wave og gravitational energy equal
to three times the mass of the sun.
Prof Danzmann (a leading
European scientist at LIGO)
praised the finding as one of the
most important discoveries since
the Higgs boson and on par with
the discovery of the double helix.
Detecting the waves opens up
the Universe to completely new
investigations leading to a new era
of astronomy.
C
ockroaches are despised
by everyone. With the
whole human race out
to squash them into
oblivion, you’d think they’d have
died out by now. But instead, they
thrive, popping up in the most
random places, and miraculously
surviving the most vigorous
squashing. Scientists have therefore
spent months investigating why
it is so freaking hard to squish a
cockroach.
Scientists from the University
of California have collected
hundreds of high-resolution, slow-
motion videos of them squishing
cockroaches. This technology
showed that a cockroach can
progress at top velocity, a whopping
600mm per second, through a 6mm
high crack, and can fit comfortably
in a crack as small as 3.2mm high.To
confirm that cockroaches are super
compressible,the scientists flattened
them with a piston applying up to
900 times their own body weight.

Sh!t Sc!ence
Scientists try and fail squishing bug
They showed that not only can the
cockroaches sustain that amount of
pressure, they can also immediately
fly away, unscathed. This shows
to everyone that the cockroach is,
scientifically, the creepiest animal
on Earth (or is that just me?).
But there is more to this research.
It subscribes to a line of scientific
investigation called terradynamics,
where scientists study how animals
moveinthehopeofdesigningrobots
capable of negotiating complex
terrain, such as muddy, sandy, or
rough surfaces. By analysing the
movements of cockroaches, the
scientists have uncovered a new
mode of locomotion on which
they modelled a palm-sized, soft-
bodied legged robot. This robot
can manipulate very rough and
constricting environments in a
way that no other robot could. The
authors of the paper claim that
this is the first step towards an
effective ‘search-and-rescue’ robot,
which could help us rapidly locate
survivors in disaster situations.
So next time you question the
logic behind a piece of research,
next time you look at a Nature
article twice,scrunching up your
face,next time you roll your eyes
to the projects that manage to
secure funding despite being
based on some seemingly
ridiculous premise, think about
what we’ve learned from the
creepy yet humble cockroach
and recognise that perhaps sh!t
science is in fact....The Sh!t.
