ne enters the exhibition
through a room
with pillars that are
kaleidoscopes of British
Vogue magazine covers throughout
the years,and is instantly transported
to a magical world. The films at the
end of the entrance corridor act to
further set the scene and create that
fantasy atmosphere which resonates
throughout the show. The films
contrast the iconicity of the covers
with their whimsical and dreamy air.
Robin Muir, curator of the
exhibition, points out that “since
Vogue’s debut, photography has been
its lifeblood”, and the centrality
of photography to Vogue’s essence
since its conception is wonderfully
conveyed in the way the photographs
are presented,as well as their content
itself.
Those who’ve attended other
fashion photography exhibits in
London last year will instantly
recognize works by Horst and Guy
Bourdin in the ‘100 Years in Vogue’
gallery. Mario Testino’s photograph
of Kate Moss in a corridor is also
instantly recognizable by his
signature photography style. Each
photograph is labelled with the
photographer’s name in the same
way a painting is labelled with the

Vogue 100: A Century of Style is a celebration of history and what made it beautiful
name of the painter. With this
approach the photographer is truly
emphasized as an artist with regards
to his or her role in and importance
to Vogue.
All the photographs stand out
from those seen in other magazines
by how like works of art they are in
themselves – how well the model,
from make-up to clothes to the
pose, fits the surroundings to evoke
a specific emotion or convey a
message. Overall each photograph
is almost surreal – truly magical
and fantastically beautiful. Each is
also extremely unique; Vogue has a
history of surprising readers with
the unexpected and a dedication
to taking no shortcuts in ensuring
the authenticity of the beautiful
world they create for their readers.
For example, there are photographs
of a model in Peru beside local
residents by Mario Testino, and one
which was shot by Tim Walker in
Mongolia with the model sitting on
a yak.
Vogue 100 takes its chance to
“replay Vogue’s greatest hits”– iconic
photographs that defined the
magazine’s milestones. For example,
Kate Moss’s first ever cover and
story are instantly recognizable.
Beside these are ‘hidden gems’ -
rare original photographs from
the 1920s and 1930s that are
particularly precious. Some of these
have never been displayed before,
and it took Robin Muir five years
to hunt them down from sources
all over the world including private
collectors, auction houses, and
international art galleries. Not only

are the pictures appreciated for their
aesthetic beauty, but also because
“some pictures just drip history”,
and are representations of not only
fashion’s history, but the world’s as
a whole.
This exhibition also shows Vogue as
more than just a fashion magazine
in emphasizing its promotion of
and inspiration by the art world. In
the ‘Century of Magazines’ gallery
are Vogue editions that introduced
readers to the drawings of Picasso
and featured a story on Matisse. A
photograph of Aldous Huxley is
displayed in the 1920’s room; he was
subeditor of Vogue and later its chief
book reviewer!
The physical evolution of Vogue,
displayed issue by issue in the

‘Century of Magazines’ gallery, is
a captivating journey. These range
from beautiful Art Deco-style
hand-painted covers on bound
copies to the glossy digitalized
issues of today. But in addition to its
physical evolution, Vogue 100 offers
a comprehensive exploration of how
the magazine responded to current
fashion trends of each decade in
addition to the changing times in
society and world events.
This exhibition shows why
British Vogue stands out from
other fashion magazines in that
it did not passively mirror trends,
but invented, reinterpreted, and
presented them in such a way as to
stay true to the magazine’s vision.
Each issue of Vogue remains a work
of art in itself.
Throughout each decade, its
readers opened Vogue to find more
than just the latest news in fashion.
On the very first page, Vogue
promised that “really and truly, such
amazing things are going to happen
to you that you would never believe
them, unless you saw them in
Vogue”. Each issue provides a portal
to another beautiful world with an
air of magic and mystery contained
between the covers. Vogue 100
successfully captures this wonderful
world, leaving a lasting imprint of
beauty on its viewers and, of course,
an aesthetic inspiration to be utterly
fashionable.
Vogue 100 is on at the National
Portrait Gallery until 22nd
May
