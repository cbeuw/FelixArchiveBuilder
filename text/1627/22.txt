This week, you're the
women's rugby team. In
protest of last year's Varsity,
you decide to play your
match in those inflatable
sumo suits. However, injuries
are significantly reduced, and
Sport Imperial rolls out the
suits across all the Rugby
teams. The boys are secretly
grateful.

This week, you're trying to
travel to Syria to fight for
jihadist causes. However,
you are mistaken for a RAG
jailbreaker, and instead of
fearing you, people just
offer to give you their loose
change.
This week you’re going
through airport security.
However, you’re withheld
because you are wearing a ‘we
are sex bob-omb’t-shirt made
famous by the comic book
franchise and subsequent
movie Scott Pilgrim. You’re
questioned without charge
for nine hours. This is
perfectly legal.
This week you’re flicking
throughtheEveningStandard
when you're come across
some offensive content. You
attempt to collect up every
issue before remembering
there are 900,000 in London
and you collapse in a pool of
ripped up newspapers and
your own salty tears.
This week, after the press
attention garnered by IC of
late, you're offered a part on
a new structured reality series
based at Imperial: Made In
China.
However, you soon realise
you are the token minority,
and join their rival show: The
Only Way Is No Sex.
This week you’re writing the
horoscopes but you’re doing
it nervously. Your complex
book of astrological star
maps are telling you to take
the mickey out of the sabbs,
but you’re worried that’ll get
you banned. You cave and do
some horoscopes about butts
instead.
This week, you’re the US
government.
“pls pls can u jailbreak my
iPhone timmy?” you ask
Apple.
“Nooooo don’t do dis 2 me
obama” they reply.
“fuk u” you respond.
This week you’re Kanye
West. Someone nicks your
iPhone, and changes your
Twitter password. The world
keeps thinking it’s you saying
terrible things, but it's not!
You’d tweet about it, but
you know, the password and
everything.
This week you’re Kendrick in
a world full of Taylors.
This week you’re the RSM.
Finally realising that
women go to Imperial,
you accommodate them by
designating toilets for their
exclusive use. Riots break
out, as this move is seen
as a gateway to things like
maternity leave and mixed
sex tutorials.
This week you decide to run
for every position in the
elections, but accidentally
win them all. Now you’re
chair of everything. You
merge all clubs, renaming
them SocSoc and it turns out
to be the most successful act
of social cohesion Imperial
has ever seen.
This week you're Jeb
Bush's gun. In order to
distance yourself from the
campaign (you're more of
a Hillary gal) you make a
public announcement that
you're officially a Democrat
now, but no one takes you
seriously. You buy a gun, cos
it's America and even the
guns have guns.

Can you see us in this picture? No, you can't,
because we're completely transparent.
