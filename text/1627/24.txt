BUCS victory for Waterpolo
A
fter securing 4th
place
in the Premier South
division, a home draw
against Northumbria
awaited the Imperial College Men’s
waterpolo team in the first cup
round of BUCS on Wednesday.
With a number of starting players
missing, things were not looking
good, and early in the week they
quickly got a lot worse. Problems
with pool bookings left the team
with nowhere to play the match and
at risk of conceding a walkover.
Lengthy negotiations with
Northumbria eventually led to the
agreement that the only option
was to travel away to them. With
less than 24 hours notice the team
gathered 13 dedicated players and
organised trains to make it up north
just in time.

opening goal, but it wasn’t long
before one of our medics, Alex
Macaulay, bagged an equalizer
after getting free from his marker
down the right wing. Another
Northumbria goal quickly put
them back in front, but TJ, Ramon
Fernandez, responded with a great
shot from far out to end the first
quarter 2-2.
As the second quarter progressed,
growing home support pushed
Northumbria into the lead and
by the third quarter they had
accumulated a four goal advantage.
Running out of time, four goals
down, and a long way from home,
things weren’t looking good for
Imperial. A time out was called to
gather the team before the game
slipped out of reach.
Imperial came out of the time out
composed and determined, quickly
scoring three goals in a row with no
response from Northumbria thanks
to solid defence and great saves from
goalkeeper Maurice Zard.The third
quarter continued and Northumbria
managed to regain their lead leaving
the score 10-8.
Thetalkgoingintothefinalquarter
stressed the importance of keeping
our defence strong, and a reminder
of how important the match was
sent the tired Imperial team out
with a new lease of life. Impeccable
defending left Northumbria
frustrated and prevented them from
scoring a single goal in the last
quarter despite having three man-
up attacks. Still two goals down
with only three minutes left on the
clock Maurice made another top
save, passed the ball down the right
wing to Alberto Lauri who played
a perfect pass into Ramon’s hand
on the left. Ramon exclaimed “this
one’s for you Jenny!” as he put the
ball away for his fourth and most
important goal of the game.
With less than a minute left on the
clock swim captain, Alex Picksley,
made a decisive tackle in our half
and played the ball to safety. From
there, Laurie Edwards, managed to
get the ball to captain, James (Irish)
Mccomish, who came in from the
right side and put the ball past their
keeper on the near post to level
the scores 10-10 with less than 20
seconds remaining.The final whistle
blew and penalties were to follow.
Alberto scored the first penalty
for Imperial and Maurice made
an important save putting us in a
good position. Adamos Solomou
stepped up next and scored, again
followed by a Northumbria miss.
Northumbria pulled back thanks to
an Imperial miss, but David calmly
scored his to keep the pressure on.
A questionable signal from the
ref meant Imperial captain, Irish,
horribly miscued his penalty and
didn’t even get to take it forcing the
teams into sudden death instead of
securing the win. Alex Macaulay
scored, as did Northumbria. Next
up, Laurie Edwards kept calm
under the pressure and scored,
putting everything on their next
penalty taker. Imperial stood
poolside watching as Northumbria
took a strong penalty towards the
bottom right corner. But somehow,
after four long quarters and six good
penalties, Maurice had the legs to
get his hand to it sending the ball
onto the post, and Imperial into the
next round.
Well-deserved celebrations began
immediately and the team travelled
home with high hopes for the next
stage of the competition in Sheffield
in March.
