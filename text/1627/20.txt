Take a hike with Firewatch

elltale’s The Walking
Dead was met with
critical acclaim when
it was released in 2012,
and arguably revitalised the dying
adventure game genre. Firewatch
has much in common with Telltale’s
game, released by Campo Santo, a
studio founded by creative leads
who had previously worked on The
Walking Dead.
Unlike Telltale’s point-and-click
inspired adventure games, the
story unravels from a first-person
perspective. Early marketing hinted
at a game that looked and played
like a survival game, with the player
chopping down trees and exploring
caves, but the player’s interaction
with the environment is in reality,
rather limited. Firewatch is not a
hiking simulator.
The four-to-five hour story follows
a volunteer fire lookout, Henry, and
his relationship with his supervisor
Delilah (they communicate via
walkie-talkie). The script, from
writer Sean Vanaman, manages to
succinctly tell a story which mixes
humour and mystery. It’s short for
a videogame, which is ultimately a
good thing as there’s no filler or plot

spoiling too much, Firewatch isn’t
a story that is grand or fantastical;
it’s grounded in reality with a tight
focus on the interaction between
its main characters. Some have
complained that it is anti-climatic
and non-cathartic, a symptom of
the fact that it offers something
new in video games – a narrative
that is more subtle. Gamers are
used to instant rewards and results,
but Firewatch requires the player to
think and reflect.
Those who can’t afford a flight
to North America to visit it’s lush
national parks will find solace in the
setting of the beautiful wilderness
of Campo Santo’s debut release.The
environments,rendered in the Unity
Engine, are inspired by Yosemite
and Yellowstone. Whether you are
walking around a forest, a cave or a
lake, the game is truly breathtaking.
The changes in environment and
time of day are reflected in Chris
Remo’s moody score. When the
game is at it’s most thrilling,
the soundtrack adds even more
suspense. It’s part of the continuing
trend of indie games with great
soundtracks.
The only downside to an otherwise
spectacular debut, is the game’s
poor performance on the PS4.
Normally, I don’t like focussing on
the technical problems with games,
but with Firewatch the frequent
framerate issues are noticeable.
However, play the game on PC and
you’ll be able to fully enjoy one of
the best adventure games in recent
years.
