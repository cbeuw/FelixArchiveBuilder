More than one female toilet for RSM
All but one female toilet was removed from the Goldsmith’s Wing by College Estates
over the summer but now they’re getting changed back
W
omen in the
G o l d s m i t h ’ s
wing of the RSM
building had a bit
of a shock after coming back over
the summer: all but a single female
toilet had been converted to men’s
only.This meant that women had to
either queue to use one loo or walk
to another building if it was out of
order.
A survey into the problem was
commissioned by the new Head of
the Department of Materials, Peter
Haynes, and it was obvious from
the 100 responses from staff and
students that change was needed.
Both male and female responses
were strongly in support of more
female toilets across the department.
The case for having changed the
toilets in the first place was not a
strong one, as there were already a
set of men’s toilets close by.
However, without consultation
with the deparment, Estates had
changed them anyway. Although
there were technical reasons as to
why the space could not be evenly
divided, they had still left only one
female toilet.
Haynes’ survey proposed making
the four grouped toilets unisex, as
well as the single accessible toilet, to
please anyone uncomfortable with
the idea of mixed loos.
The survey results were shown to
Estates, who agreed the situation
was unacceptable. Instead of
making the toilets all unisex, there
was strong support for making the
men’s toilets women’s and making
the single female accessible toilet
unisex.
One RSM member told FELIX:
“As a woman in male dominated
departments with usually around
half the number of women’s toilets
as men’s (meaning walking ten
minutes to toilets if any are out
of order), having our Head of
Department take charge and do
something about it is amaze”.
The department of materials
holds an Athena Swan Silver
award, which is an accolade given
to Higher Education or research
bodies that can prove they are
actively advancing female staff and
students in an attempt to achieve
gender equality in the workplace.
The works are to be completed
over the 5th
and 6th
of March.
Female toilet users of RSM can
collectively breath a sigh in relief.

...allowed to board the flight to
Turkey, and were now down several
hours and a few hundred pounds.
The team let the RAG committee
know about the situation via
Facebook, and this message was
quickly passed to Imperial College
via campus security. There was
some miscommunication involved,
and college were told the group
were arrested, which they were
not. However, the students were
not contacted by anyone at college
during this time (or since) regarding
their safety.
Despite the ordeal, the team went
back to Heathrow the next day and
flew to Berlin, before hitchhiking
to Radzymin in Poland, which
amounted to 907 miles in 36 hours.
This meant they had raised £724,
not including the amount they had
paid for the unused flights.
The group were told their removal
was a direct instruction from the
pilot but suspected it was because
they had asked a flight attendant if
they could make an announcement
about the charities to the passengers
over the plane’s intercom. The
attendant said she would ask to the
pilot and it was soon after this that
they were removed.
When the group returned to
the UK they had a meeting with
the union and RAG, where they
were told that the union would
help them recover the money from
Turkish Airlines, which would add
to the funds they’d raised for charity,
and that perhaps there would be a
meeting with senior management
at college. However, weeks passed
and the jailbreak group did not hear
anything from the union or college.
Eventually,through RAG,they were
told that the union’s senior managers
now felt that “any correspondence
regarding this matter should come
directly from the students rather
than from Imperial College Union”.
The jailbreak team members
told FELIX they were “extremely
frustrated” with the union, so
decided to attempt to recoup
the charity money themselves.
Although several weeks had now
passed, the group repeatedly tried
to get in contact with Turkish
Airlines, which culminated in

Jailbreak
The group
were told
their removal
was a direct
instruction
from the
pilot
the three students turning up at
the company’s headquarters in
Kensington Olympia last week.
After initially promising them a
full refund, a member of staff later
emailed the group saying they would
only be paid back the tax. After
explaining the situation once again
to the airline, they finally agreed
to pay back the amount which had
been raised for charity.
‘Hand in Hand for Syria’, the
charity whose name seems to have
got them chucked off the flight,told
FELIX that it was “sorry to hear
they encountered difficulties” but
that “their total raised amount was
incredible, and we’re so grateful that
they have dedicated to raising funds
for the people of Syria”.
RAG told FELIX they were
“extremely grateful for the support
received during and after the
incident from the Student Activities
team” at the union but that it was
“unfortunate that senior managers
in the union felt it was not
appropriate to help out the students
to recover the money”, adding that
they were “extremely proud of the
team for persevering and recovering
the money and delighted that this
can now be donated to great causes”.
The union told FELIX that they
had “supported these students
immediately after the incident and
worked closely with College to
ensure there was no impact on their
studies or ability to travel in future.
We decided that the students would
have a greater chance of getting a
refund if they contacted the airline
directly, which turned out to be
correct.”
RAG jailbreak involves teams
of students attempting to get as
far away from a starting point as
possible in a 36 hour period. The
team can’t spend any of their own
money, and must use donations
Despite the
ordeal, the
team went
back to
Heathrow
the next day
or favours to travel. The teams are
sponsored per mile they get away
from Imperial, with the record
for the furthest being Singapore.
Although this one happened back
in November, another jailbreak
has been scheduled for the 19th
of
March.
Turkey is one of the main routes
into Syria, especially for Westerners
who go there to fight. The British
police say they suspect up to 700
people from the UK have gone to
work or fight for jihadist causes in
Syria and Iraq. Schedule 7 of the
Terrorism Act 2000 allows police
to hold people at ports, rail stations
and airports even without needing
“reasonable suspicion”. They can
then be held for up to nine hours.
