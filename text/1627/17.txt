#HotTakes
of the week
To Pimp A Butterfly won five
Grammy’s at this year’s ceremony,
missing out on the main prize to
T Swizzle’s 1989. Swift’s latest
album was great and might have
been deserving any other year,
but it pales in comparison to
Kendrick’s politically infused LP.

Kendrick Lamar steals
the show, but Taylor Swift
steals his Grammy
Please no (Mackle)more
On Monday, Macklemore
released ‘Spoons’,which some critics
have labelled “the worst song ever
recorded.” My 13 year old cousin
could have written a song with more
mature themes: “And she’s like, Can
you undo my bra strap? / I try to
play it cool, in my head I’m like, Aw
yeah!” How did this guy ever win a
Grammy?
The Life of Pablo

well as Rihanna who lays down
a flawless Nina Simone cover in
‘Famous’.
The new blood featured here
includes up-and-comers TY Dolla
Sign, Post Malone, Desiigner,
and Yung Thug. Travis Scott also
returns off the back of his incredible
debut studio album Rodeo to lend
his unique production stylings as
he did in Yeezus. Overall, when
compared to something like My
Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy,
which featured various godfathers
of rap such as Wu Tang members
RZA and Raekwon as well as Jay Z,
The Life of Pablo has a more modern
and fresh feel. Kanye’s mastermind
for production is seen in flashes of
absolute brilliance such as the outro
to ‘Famous’, the explosive gospel
sections of ‘Ultralight Beam’ and
the short intro to ‘Wolves’. I haven’t
heard such instantly ear-pleasing
perfection since the explosive
guitar section at the end of ‘New
Slaves’. True to its Pablo Picasso
namesake, the various periods of
Kanye’s discography are all present
here. Yeezus’ gritty harshness is
seen on ‘Freestyle 4’ and 808s and
Heartbreak’s solemn ballad-style
with ‘FML’. Even College Dropout’s
outro ‘Last Call’ is reflected in ‘30
Hours’.
Interestingly, for the first time,
Kanye West has made album that
is simply that – an album. Kanye
seems to be drawing inspiration
rather than giving it. Ultimately
I do not see this as a bad thing, as
I have always been less of a fan of
Kanye’s concept albums such as 808s
and Yeezus. As it stands, The Life
of Pablo is a work of energetic yet
soulful expression – Kanye doesn’t
hold back and this is where his
passion shines through. Everybody
seems to hate how cocky Kanye is
but at least he can back it up.

The Life
of Pablo
has a more
modern
and fresh
feel
F
or those of us who have
been following the run-
up to The Life of Pablo
album, it’s been a ride.
The release cycle was so messy at
times many people began to expect
disappointment. Four album names
and endless delays later however,
Kanye West’s seventh studio album
has finally dropped. And, despite
all the drama, The Life of Pablo is
absolutely phenomenal.
‘Ultralight Beam’opens the album.
This gospel banger, with its church
choir,organs and auto tune is already
many people’s favourite of the
tracklist as is Chance the Rapper’s
verse.In my opinion,it’s the best rap
album opener since Nas’ ‘NY State
of Mind’ or GZA’s ‘Liquid Swords’.
The track is anthemic perfection.
Listening to the rest of The Life
of Pablo, it then becomes clear
that Kanye started as he wished to
proceed.Two other stand out tracks
include the haunting and nocturnal
‘Wolves’, and ‘Father Stretch My
Hands Pt. 1 & 2’, which are both
very reminiscent of Atlantan
rappers such as Future, Migos and
Kanye West causes tidal waves with his eighth album
Kanye
seems to

inspiration
rather than
giving it
Metro Boomin with their trippy
autotuned vibes.
Producer-wise, if one said
that Yeezus was made great by
collaboration with Rick Rubin and
My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
by Jeff Bhasker then Chance
should be considered the master
collaborator on this record. As
always (to quote Jayson Greene)
Kanye “makes people you don’t care
about sound fantastic and people
you do care about sound immortal”.
Returning faces from other projects
include Kid Cudi who features in
‘Father Stretch My Hands Pt.1’ as
The Life of Pablo really wasn’t
worth the hype (sorry Ben).And Mr.
West certainly isn’t happy with all
the critics who have dared to suggest
it isn’t the god-like masterpiece he
had hoped (Pitchfork gave it a 9.0 so
I don’t know why he’s complaining).
I guess life’s hard being married to
a businesswoman who earned $52.5
million in 2015. Kanye needs some
help, and he needs it now. His art
might be great, but it’s not worth
more than building schools for the
impoverished.
He wanted the world to
know his struggle
Takes so hot they are literally hell
