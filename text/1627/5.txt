Things you’re desperate to ask your Muslim lab partner
Can you shampoo with a headscarf on? Where can you pray when
you’ve only got five minutes?

M
uslims are probably
one of the easiest
groups of people
to identify from
the way we dress, girls being more
obvious than guys. As Muslims we
find that there’s a lot of confusion
about why we do certain things and
people speculate because they’re too
scared to ask in case we get offended.
Contrary to what the media might
tell you,1 in 5 of us don’t sympathise
with a certain group of people. In
fact we’d be more than happy to tell
you why we don’t eat all Haribos or
why I didn’t join the Pub Crawl at
the start of the year. For those too
shy to question us directly, here’s a
selection of questions Muslims on
campus have been asked in the past.
We pray five times a day wherever
we can and nip out whenever we
find an opportunity during labs. If
there’s only ten minutes before the
lecture starts it’s unlikely I’m going
to trek it to the Prayer Room (in
Prince’s Gardens) and make it back
in time. We pretty much disappear
to anywhere we can find a small,
peaceful space on campus. It also
has to be clean, so along with that
portable charger, a travel prayer
mat can also be quite handy. This
includes lecture theatres, empty
rooms, secret corridors and between
Yes, you
probably
did see me
awkwardly
massaging
my foot
bookshelves. Basically anywhere
that won’t cause an inconvenience
to anybody else. One Islamic
Society member made it her aim to
pray in every building atleast once
before she graduates. On Fridays
(holiest day of the week), we pray in
congregation in Beit wherewe even
have speakers set up to deliver the
sermon.
Unfortunately we don’t have
“aesthetically pleasing” waterproof
hijabs yet (swimming caps don’t
count) and it’s harder to shampoo
with a scarf covering your hair. In
all seriousness though, our hijabs
are only worn in front of unrelated
men.We can take them off when it’s
a girls only setting or the men are
close relations.
Before prayer we have to wash
our hands, face, ears, arms and feet.
So yes, you probably did see me
awkwardly massaging my foot.
That would be the call to prayer.
It’s the same as the one you might
get woken up by on a trip to Turkey
or Egypt.
Many of us learn to read and recite
Qur’anic Arabic and sometimes
accidentally drop phrases such as
“insha Allah”, “masha Allah” and
“Alhamdulillah” into standard
English conversations. Force of
habit. They mean “God-willing”,
“God has willed it”and “Praise be to
God”. We also greet other muslims
with “Salaam” or “Assalaamu
alaikum” or if you’ve got that extra
bit of breath, “Assalaamu alaikum
wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh”.
They all mean peace be unto you
and the last means “peace, mercy
and blessings of Allah be upon you”.
But no, other than that not all of us
are native Arabic speakers and so
for many of us, this is the most we
speak. However, many non-Arabic
speaking muslims learn the language
to enhance their understanding of
the Qur’an. Not all Arabic words
have an English equivalent so it’s
better to try and understand things
in context.

Where do you go to pray
at Imperial?
Do you shower with your
scarf on?
Did I just see you
washing yourself in the
toilets?
Mate, what is that
alarm?
Do you all speak Arabic?
Can you hear properly
with that scarf on your
head?
A travel
prayer mat
can also be
quite handy
Sorry, could you repeat the
question please?
Religion can be a sensitive topic
which is why many tend to avoid
asking questions. As part of our
annual “Discover Islam Week”, the
Islamic Society will be hosting a
range of events from exhibitions, to
a talk on Islam’s role in the world,
to spoken word by British ex-hip
hop artist, Tommy Evans. Next
Wednesday (24th
of February) there
will also be a free, informal lunch on
the ISoc and the opportunity to ask
more questions that may have been
at the back of your mind. Looking
forward to seeing some fresh,
inquisitive faces!
