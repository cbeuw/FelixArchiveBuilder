f we were to play a word
association game and start
off with the word ‘eye’ you
might shout out ‘face’, or
‘London’, or even ‘mantis shrimp’,
but you probably wouldn’t shout
out ‘bacterium’.Well, new biologcal
research might change that forever.
Although the phenomenon of
bacteria moving in response to
light, known as phototaxis, has been
documented since the late 1800s, it
took until this year for a group of
observant researchers to discover
how certain bacteria do this. A
research team led by Nils Schuergers
exposed a plate of Synechocystis
to a directed light source under a
microscope, to then observe the
bacterial response At the bacteria’s
side opposite to the incident light
and direction of movement, a bright
spot was realised. They discovered
that this was indicative of the
bacteria acting like a little eye. The
light spot was the result of light
focused from the beam, hitting the
bacteria, the bacterias surface then
behaving as a lens,and its cytoplasm
as the retina, re-focussing the light
beam.
This phototaxis process by
Synechocystis is a negative response
to bright light exposure on their
surface. Scientists investigated
this further by shining a laser onto
the centre of a plate contiaing
Synechocystis, and then using a
light to direct the cells towards this
centre. They found that cells would

Science, what’s good?
DNA is more than just a
sequence of As, Ts, C, and Gs. It
is a fingerprint of our individuality,
capturing our primitive past and
even the behaviour of our ancestors;
and it seems our ancestors hooked
up with our evolutionary ‘cousins’
a lot earlier than we previously
thought. Specifically 110,000 years
earlier.
It is not a novelty that we find
Neanderthal DNA in human DNA,
however, an international group
of researchers recently found the
presence of a reverse situation. That
is, human DNA incorporated into
the genetic code of a Neanderthal.
A 50,000-year-old Neanderthal toe
bone contained a human signature
embedded within its collagen case.
The findings have posed the need
to rethink human migration in the
light of the now apparent genetic
evidence, pointing strongly to an
earlier migration out of Africa.

move towards the laser, until they
hit the beam, where they would
then retract.
Further research showed that,
when two sources of light were
introduced, the bacteria would
present two spots on their surface,
and move towards the light sources
at an intermediate angle between
the two.
Being cyanobacteria, and thus
using photosynthesis to make
glucose for energy, it is important
that Synechocystis and similar
bacteria have a system to navigate
towards optimal light conditions.
That is, the bacteria need enough
light to make sufficient glucose,
but should not be exposed to too
much light, which would damage
the bacteria cell. Here scientists
explored the mechanism to which
this optimum is achieved.
Although this is a beautifully
elegant method for spherical
bacteria to respond to light, it
remains to be seen how this will
translate to rod shaped bacteria,
assuming, they even use a similar
method… Watch this space.

ane sugar, honey, raw
turbinado, coconut
sugar, agave syrup. Many
nutrition experts sitting
on their high horses all wax lyrical
over these glistening labels, eager to
proclaim the nutritional properties
of each. These are the same people
who are religious avocado-toast
eaters and green-juice guzzlers.
These are the people who are fine
with anything that’s not white sugar
or high-fructose corn syrup, the
four words which instigate heated
debate in the world of nutrition.
The hidden truth? All these sugars
are the same, in the sense that they
all get processed the same way.
Too much sugar in any form is
dangerous.
Processed starches and breakfast
cereals might as well unzip
themselves from their beige coats
because they are digested in an
instant, in much the same way as
our bodies process that brownie or
bowl of salted caramel Haagen Dazs
(which I must admit will always be
a firm favourite of mine). Eating a
bowl of sugar and eating a bowl of
cereal may taste different, but below
the neck, they’re metabolically
identical.
So what about sugar in fruit?
Ah, another question that almost

he walks among us and with
us. Rattling in our pockets
besideloosechange,beaming
through the air, whipping us
through the underground in the
much-beloved, spacious Tube, and
sending Londoners south to Ibiza
orTangiers.Science is everywhere in
our world. But it’s more than just a
pragmatic method of understanding
the universe and creating new ways
to navigate and interact with it;
it’s a creative force in our human
society with powerful feedback
mechanisms that determine many
aspects of our lives. So no matter
how interesting (or dreary) you may
find it, it’s worth exploring how we
interact with science and the many
impacts it has on our lives – from
the kid learning the hard way that
gravity is a very real force when they
do that first belly flop at the pool, to
the disenchanted adult zoning out
on the couch, to some droning late
night news about climate change.
In Science & the City we’ll
explore the many interconnected
ways that we interact with the
scientific way of thinking, and
its real-world application. From
societal interactions, challenges
within scientific communities,
connecting science with other
sectors and spheres of life,to cultural
and historical understandings and
beyond, we’ll explore together this
very modern way of thinking about
our world. Questions like why is
so much of researcher’s time now
allocated to grant writing instead
of research? How do we address
sexism in laboratories and research
facilities? Why are field naturalists
dying out? How do we make
our research exciting to different
audiences – or do we even need to?
Considering Imperial College’s
strengthsinsciencesandthefactthat
we have the greatest concentration
of high-impact research of any
UK university, many of us will go
on work directly in science, often
in influential positions. So let’s
consider what space it is that science
occupies in the world as we move
through it, with it, and because of it.
And if you have any thoughts
around the human side of science,
get in touch, and we can go for a
coffee (or tea, or water, or whatever)
and explore your views of Science &
the City.

demands a series of catfights in the
vegan community. Yes, fruit has
lots of sugar, especially mangoes,
durians and grapes. Even the ratio
of fructose to glucose in fruit and
table sugar is practically the same.
Keeping in mind many scientific
studies have proven that, although
fructose increases blood insulin
and glucose levels in the fasting
state, making it seem that much
better than glucose alone, it actually
increases average triglyceride levels
more than glucose. However, it’s
the fibre and vitamins in fruit that
compensate for this, and add to the
wholesomeness of eating fruit. The
problem arises when you’ve got a
bottle of fruit juice for fuel, because
this has no fibre whatsoever. You

might as well be drinking a coke.
The solution for many, lies in the
glorious buzz of anything containing
artificial sweeteners, the siren call of
your trusty diet sodas. Now I feel
bad saying this because I’ve been a
Diet Coke fan for many years, and
although the craze has waned, I still
give in to the odd temptation. Sadly,
and ironically, the stuff wreaks
havoc on our normal metabolic
routes and hormones, most notably
insulin’s neurobiological actions.
The infamous sweetners aspartame
and Splenda still produce drastic
spikes in insulin because the brain
is tricked into wanting sugar, sugar
and more sugar.
I know I’m making it sound like
there’s just no win-win situation. I
mean, sugar tastes good, and we all
want to feel and taste something
which doesn’t have us plucking
out our eyebrows. There’s no need
to feel pressurized to be the most
perfect healthy robot human. Here
at university, life is for living, for
those 3am pizzas and ice creams,
not gnawing on grass. It’s simply
important to be aware of the
various metabolic effects our best
friend sugar, and to go easy on our
overloaded systems once in a while.
Go on, have a Diet Coke. With a
splash of rum.
At least with sugar mice, at peace with the fact that you’re basically consuming pure sugar. Photo Credit Osaka19

ears
Ah, the exotic and awe inspiring
super-Earth, a class of exoplanet
larger than Earth but not quite the
size of a gas giant. For quite some
time now, scientists have been
fantasising about one in particular,
55 Cancri E, and what conditions
on such a celestial body might be
like.A group of astronomers though
recently burst everyone’s dream
bubble, pointing out it’s probably
a cyanide packed, face-melting
hellhole.
The team of astronomers used
Hubble pictures to measure the
spectra of light coming off the
planet as it passed in front of its
parent star.
Sadly the high levels of hydrogen,
helium and hydrogen cyanide
detected, lighter elements and
their products (which our planet’s
atmosphere lost long ago), don’t
seem to be putting an end to the
search for a cooler, larger home any
time soon.

Over the past decade we have
seen many great breakthroughs in
3D printing,improving the speed of
the process, the smoothness of the
products and the range of materials
available for printing with.
One of the materials that has
shown promise in its application
across the health sector of course is
human cells.
A team has come up with a new
technique – integrated tissue-organ
printing which hopes to make the
dream of printing of organs a reality.
The new technique allows lacing
of artificial body parts with living
cells and was successfully used to
3D print a human ear.
So far scientists have been able
to generate 3D printed bone,
muscle and cartilage which after
being implanted in mice, developed
natural structures such as blood
vessels, closely resembling natural
tissues.

Termites did
castes first
W
hen you think of
castes, the animal
kingdom may
not be the first
thing that pops into your mind.
Nonetheless, castes are prevalent in
many other species besides humans,
with bees a shining example of an
efficient caste system, with their
queens, workers and soldiers.
However, it seems that whatever
bees did to become a eusocial
species, termites did it first.
New fossils, unearthed in
Myanmar show that termites
became eusocial about 100
million years ago, aproximately
80 million years earlier than what
palaeontologists thought until now.
The fossil finds from Myanmar
included five termite species, two of
which new to science.

Nanoparticles have been used to
precisely target and, via the use of
infrared light, successfully destroy
cancer cells left over from excision
procedures.
This new method, only
implemented in mice so far, used
clusters of gold atoms to clear the
mice of any traces of cancer cells,
which is important as such cells can
act as sources of new tumours.
The procedure has been around for
years, but has been problematic as,
like with other treatments, precision
has been low, resulting in damage to
adjacent healthy tissue
However a research team has
managed to greatly refine the use
of nanoparticles, by coupling them
with appropriate antibodies, as well
as using ultrashort infrared rays to
zap the gold bearing cells.
Clinical trials could begin in the
next two years, which if successful
would greatly aid the fight against
cancer
