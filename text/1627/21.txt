A
fter an icy cold weekend
trip to Portland where
we explored all the
pleasures the Dredger
wreck has to offer, Imperial College
Underwater Club was off to bigger
and better (and warmer) places.
Lanzarote was the choice for the
inauguration of the ICUC winter
tour, not least because we heard the
wine was cheaper than petrol. With
three associate members and four “I
shouldbeinlectures”members,there
was a good balance of experienced
members and those who were yet to
learn the endless inside jokes. After
a sufficient acclimatisation period of
cheese and chorizo, it was time to
get into the water.
Although no one was keen for the
standard shake out dive, we were
all pleasantly surprised, especially
Jo “Ms. BSAC” Beresford, as there
were cuttlefish at almost every
turn. The afternoon dive was also a
pleasant surprise as the abundance
of nudibranchs was also ideal.
Likewise there were plenty of
scorpionfish and bearded fireworms
to keep us on our toes, or more
accurately, our hands off the reef.
The next morning marked the first
of many dives where we all flirted
with the maximum allowed depth,
except for Andreas “Was No One
Else Legal” Georgiou, that is. The
Blue Hole was the chosen dive site,
although it was quite dark, and thus
the more exotic name of the Black
Hole was used. Red Cross was the
afternoon boat dive, and was well
worth the five minute ride. To top
off a great day, we went back in after
dark for a night dive filled with
more cuttlefish, nudibranchs, and
some giant sea hares.
While it wasn’t a Sunday, we still
went to the famous Cathedral the
next day – it just happened to be
30 metres under water. It wasn’t
until the afternoon artificial wreck
graveyard dive that Keshwyn
“Computer Bending” Annauth
actually monitored his depth.
Unfortunately, the drysuit donning
guide was strict about the “don’t
go inside the wreck” rules, which
did not please Olivia “Penetration
Keen” Ashton. The next morning
had something special in store,
two seahorses, leading Alex “Baby
Instructor” Leonard to call the
unnamed dive the “Seahorse
Safari”. The afternoon held in store
a welcomed shallower dive,allowing
everyone to breathe a bit more than
usual. The night was topped off
with a final night dive, with Karim
“Fashionably Late” Nahas leading
from the front. The final dive
involved a serious surface swim, but
Grouper Run did not disappoint,
and there were plenty of the giant
fish to spot.
The trip ended as most ICUC
trips do, and that was with a
few decompression beers, wines,
sangrias, shots, and ice cream.
Carrying on the tradition attributed
to the legendary previous chair
Theo, the last night ended back in
the water sans clothes. Luckily Josh
“Hides Your Clothes” Mo was on
hand to help everyone dry off first.

SCUBA do Lanzerote
Night dives, skinny dipping and sangria
All in all it was great escape from
wintery England for some beautiful
diving and decent company. ICUC
is already planning more trips
abroad for the coming months, with
plans for Belgium, Italy, and the
Scilly Isles taking shape. If you’re
already a qualified diver and are
interested in these trips, give us a
shout at scuba@imperial.ac.uk.
