Israel boycotts outlawed by government
Public bodies will no longer be able to opt out of buying products made on the West
Bank

B
oycotts have long been a
way for local government
to use direct action to
condemn government
approved policies, such as apartheid.
However, the government has
announced new plans to bring down
heavy punishments on government-
funded bodies such as NHS Trusts,
city councils and universities if they
choose to operate so-called “town-
hall boycotts”.
The government has called such
protests “divisive” and say they have
the potential to be anti-semetic.
It’s not just Israeli products that it
will be illegal to avoid for “unethical”
reasons. Companies involved in the
arms, tobacco or fossil fuels trades
will also be safe from democratically
voted for ‘discrimination’.
Firms who up until recently
were running some operations
in the West Bank, such as Veolia
and Sodastream, have since left
the area due to mounting pressure
from the public. Scarlett Johansson
notoriously severed her ties with
Oxfam rather than the sponsorship
deal she had with SodaStream when
the charity expressed disapproval of
companies with factories in the area.
Last year, Sussex’s student union
voted to join the boycott,divestment
and sanctions movement by
choosing not to sell Israeli products
in their union-run shops. SOAS
students voted last year in favour
of a boycott of Israeli academic
institutions. The union’s YES
campaign emphasised after their
win that the move was to target
“Israeli institutions complicit in
the oppression of Palestinians, not
individuals”.
Imperial’s own union has not
voted to boycott any Israeli products
or institutions.
The rules could also affect
public bodies boycotting other
causes or businesses, such as
arms manufacturers or fossil fuel
companies, many of which have
been boycotted by other universities.
The move has been called an
“attack on local democracy” by
representatives of Labour leader,
Jeremy Corbyn. If this rule had
existed back in the 60s and 70s,
the anti-apartheid in South Africa
movement of boycotts would have
been illegal.
The official announcement of the
policy is due to be made by Cabinet
Minister, Matt Hancock, when he
visits Israel in a few days time.
FELIX previously reported that
several Imperial academics had
signed an open letter promising to
boycott Israeli institutions. Boycotts
like this would be perfectly legal
under new rules.

Imperial RAG mag story published in Evening
Standard and MailOnline
Companies
involved in
the arms,
tobacco or
fossil fuels
trades will
also be safe
continued from front page
The piece went online on Tuesday
morning, and remained on the front
page of the Evening Standard’s
website for several hours.
As the Evening Standard story
broke, the president’s personal
Twitter account became private.
Later that day a similar story
appeared on the Daily Mail’s
website.This longer article included
multiple references to Lucinda’s
comment piece in last week’s
FELIX, in which she claimed that
she had been the victim of “trollish
stereotyping and personal attacks”
and that the union’s actions were
“in no way preventing RAG from
raising money”.
Lower down in the piece, which
swings in no particular direction
in support, it’s mentioned that IC
FemSoc said they hadn’t thought
the piece was sexist.
The article also links to an Imgur
upload of the RAG article itself,
which FELIX has been unable to
print.

notorious on MailOnline for being
a source of bizarre views, one reader
remarked: “These students’ antics
are just juvenile! Do we need reports
of them in an adult newspaper?”
In this week’s FELIX, several
notable RAG members wrote in,
complaining about the union’s
treatment of this year’s committee.
In a letter addressed to the union’s
President, RAG’s Vice Chair of
Activities said: “Calling the piece
sexist undermines genuine sexism”
and that she hoped “you realise
that because of this dispute, a lot of
charity money was lost”.
Lucinda told us: “I set out my
views on the trollish behaviour in
my FELIX article, and I’m grateful
for the backing I’ve received from
men and women leaders since that
time.”
