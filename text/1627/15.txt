B
en Kidd bounds into a
Notting Hill basement in
between a kebab shop and
a pizzeria. For the first
time, Gate publicity maestro Tash
Brown looks a tad worried. She
needn’t be.Gate’s work is exactly the
kind of thing I wish we had more
of here at Imperial. Passionately
done and served up with a massive
dollop of generosity on the side,
Gate Theatre is one big cosy theatre
family – and y’all are invited.(Check
out its outreach programme!) Kidd,
fresh from rehearsals, bubbles with
the same outspoken friendliness,
and we sit down to talk Ireland,
Imperial and art.
FELIX: After working with the
Young Vic, and now here at The
Gate, are you starting to feel more
part of the furniture in London?
BK: [Laughs] I don’t think anyone
feels part of the furniture in London
– it’s too big!
FELIX: Is it more bread and
butter in London and fun in
Dublin? How does your work with
DeadCentre fit in?
BK: London is much more of a
bubble. It’s commerical. Directors
learn to get 4-star reviews from the
Guardian, and Simon Stephens is
Simon Stephens because of West
End transfers [Laughs]. There’s
no such thing as famous people in
Dublin. It’s a lot more informal,
more like a family, more “What are
you going to f*** up next?”The most
important people will just pop along
to your show. Here, it’s hierarchical.
There are more stakeholders, and
you get a lot more feedback –
someone (normally a well educated
white man) who’ll say “Well done,
you’re clever enough”. But that’s a
huge support, in the sense that you
have someone there legitimising
what you do.
FELIX: This is your first play
at the Gate, and an international
premiere, too. What made you pick
up this script?
BK: Actually, it was the other
way around! This is my first time
directing something at the Gate...
Ben Williams
Arts Writer
I’d tried (unsuccessfully) to apply
for a number of things, and got
rejected. As a director, it’s a dream
when someone rings you up – that
never happens! I don’t actually
know how many Nina [Nina Segal,
In the Night Time playwright] and
Chris [Christopher Haydon, Artistic
Director at The Gate] interviewed,
but I think they had me in mind
when they were thinking of putting
on the play.
FELIX: A friend of mine saw it
and compared it to lyrics. To me it
reads like a kind of epic poem. It’s
one big stream of consciousness,and
there isn’t a single stage direction in
the whole piece. How hard has it
been to get that sense of flow across,
and keep up some tension?
BK: It’s a hard play. My first
question when I read the script was
“Why isn’t this a short story?” It’s
definitely a very langauge-focused
play. I don’t really do ‘creeping
tension’ or anything like that. I
think there’s a million different
ways you can direct things. There’s
not necessarily one set way, I just
try to be explorative and flexible.
A director should generate ideas –
you can have a rough feel of how it
should be but you need to be open to
the idea that something might have
to change. For me, the set design,
the production is very important. I
can have five or six competing ideas
– the set is the thing that has final
choice – when it has to become an
actual, physical thing.
FELIX: How important has it
been to have that link with the
writer [Nina Segal]?
BK: That’s a very important
relationship. Nina is just starting
out and she has a whole wonderful
career of writing ahead of her. You
see she’s very discreet – I think even
if she thought we were f***king it
up she wouldn’t say. She’s confident
enough in her writing to trust us,
and that someone will get it right,
eventually!
FELIX: How difficult was the
casting? I mean, the minute I read
the script, I immediately thought
that you need someone who’s going
through this... [Just having kids]
BK: [Laughs] It’s bizarre to think
how we would have made the play
without someone in the production
having kids. I don’t have kids, no
one at the Gate has kids... If Alex
[Alex Waldmann, ‘Man’] hadn’t had
kids I don’t know what we’d have
done! We cast it as naturally as
possible. These are two people who
could believably be the people in the
script.... above all, I think you cast
talent, and you cast people who are
interested in the role.
FELIX: So, the curtain comes
down on the first night. How am I
changed?
BK: I don’t know... hopefully
you’ll laugh and cry and think
differently about the universe. It’s
about creating a space for someone
to have an emotional journey.
([Laughs] “They better f**cking
cry!”) I don’t think people will come
away and want to be this or that. No
one cares what a play is about – they
care what a play’s going to be like.
FELIX: What drives you as a
director?
BK: I want to get to the point
where you can see it again and get
that same feeling you felt when you
first saw it. I want to introduce an
audience to that thrill that I had in
my head.
FELIX: Let’s say that science
is essentially about trying to make
sense of the world. Isn’t that what
art’s for? Why is there such a big
gulf between the two?
BK: There’s this cultural cringe.
It’s quite easy I think for a scientist
to come to the theatre, to go to a
gallery. It’s not easy for someone
on the arts side to go the other way
around.This idea of the Renaissance
man has been lost; we’re all
specialists – and that’s a shame. But
some people would disagree with
you. Perhaps the point of art is to
say that the world mostly doesn’t
make sense. Art tries to dance
around the gaps where we don’t
know – it’s about God and death. I
reckon as a scientist, the only reason
you get out of bed in the morning is
that you have the belief that there’s
this idea of progress. What if there
is no endpoint?
FELIX: So you wouldn’t try to
bridge those gaps? It’s not nature
that made these boundaries...
BK: I suppose there isn’t a
difference between Chemistry and
emotions. I definitely wouldn’t
support the idea of forcing all
physicists to do ballet. But some
of the things we’re doing with
DeadCentre are trying to challenge
the way that the audience interacts
with the theatre. It’s not just a
case of come in, sit down, watch
something. For example, there’s
one show we’re doing where the
audience has headphones and can
hear a directors commentary on the
show, while the show is happening.
We’re trying to make it more of a
conversation with the audience.
FELIX: What advice would you
give someone trying to get involved
in directing?
BK: Do all the things I didn’t do! I
kind of just fell into everything, fell
into ‘stuff’. I came late (after trying
to be an actor), and I was jaded,
worried “I was too old for this”.
Develop your taste, see as much
theatre as possible. Talk to as many
people as possible.Don’t be afraid of
knocking on doors (or some public
school boy will get there before
you). Above all, don’t get obsessed
on fixed paths – theatre isn’t just
one thing.

FELIX asks Gate Theatre’s new director Ben Kidd about directing and his latest work
T
he Winter’s Tale is a
true winter’s delight. It is
performed at the Globe
Theatre, but fear not
as it isn’t an outdoor getting-wet-
standing-in-the-pit affair, rather
you are welcomed to an enchanting
theatretuckednextdoor,therecently
built Sam Wanamaker Playhouse.
The Playhouse is a replica of the
theatre that Shakespeare’s plays
were written for, with no modern
giveaways in sight.It is intimate and
snug; the small stage is surrounded
by the limited audience and entirely
lit by candlelight,giving a sense that
you are peering into someone else’s
living room. Along with the rich
and vibrant characters, the musical
quartet and the intimacy you feel
warm and cosy, enough to brighten
up even the dreariest of winter
nights.
On entering the theatre I heard
murmuring that we were in for a 3
hour ordeal, however even if it was
it definitely didn’t feel like it. The
Winter’s Tale follows the (not too
complicated) story of the jealous
and suspicious King Leontes
who accuses his wife, the serene
Hermione, of adultery with his
childhood friend, another king. The
tale follows the consequences of his
sudden jealousy and the tragedy and
rather fortunate events that follow.
The first half is a little slow
and riddled more with the usual
Shakespearean outpourings of
emotions, speech and monologues,
however it is not too hard to follow
and you feel a certain sense of
satisfaction for keeping up.
After a very sincere first half
the second half picks up the pace,
beginning with a jester style
character who carries this comic
feel through to the end.The morose
atmosphere before is dissipated with
declarations of love and a surprising
amount of singing and dancing.
This juxtaposition of tragedy and
then comedy brings the play to life.
The acting as expected was
impressive. Not particularly
exceptional, but good enough. They
made good use of the stage, often
walking through the audience and
even at one point jumping into the
crowd and squeezing themselves
onto the seats.The seats were a slight
inconvenience as they are cushioned
benches, so unless you get a seat at
the rear you have to support your
own back, making it a little difficult
to get comfortable. But any notion
of discomfort is soon forgotten
when you get lost in the play. The
ending is slightly bizarre, but there
are enough good times to make up
for it.
On the whole it is a unique and
enjoyable experience, possibly more
so for the charming atmosphere
than the plot.
The Winter’s Tale is on at the Globe
until 22nd
April
The Globe’s The Winter’s Tale is striking in its clever use of an intimate atmosphere
