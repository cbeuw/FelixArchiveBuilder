RAG mag battle reaches
national newspapers
Daily Mail and Evening Standard both publish
news stories on the banned magazine's 'sexism'
T
his week, national
newspapers covered
the sexism row that has
been raging since the
union strongly advised RAG to bin
1600 copies of a satirical magazine
they’d just printed. In an attempt
to raise money for Great Ormond
Street Hospital, the British Refugee
Council and Porridge in Rice,which
works in Kenya, RAG published
a 16-page handout that included
several pages of ‘satire’, which the
union has branded a sexist example
of “harassment and bullying”against
the Union President. After last
Friday’s FELIX, which published
comment pieces responding to the
story, journalists from the Daily
Mail and Evening Standard began
to contact members of the RAG
committee, the Union President
and College.
The news story made page ten
of Tuesday’s Evening Standard
along with an image of the union
president Photoshopped over the
business school. The piece was
mostly a rehash of FELIX content,
with an additional comment from
the union’s interim Managing
Director, who said the union had
“responded to students’ concerns
about the magazine and RAG
had apologised”. A short Editorial
Comment piece on the incident
featured on page 14 of the daily
newspaper, calling it a “small but
dispiriting example of the creeping
censorship at universities”.

O

after being pulled off of a flight to
Istanbul by anti-terror police.
The group of students, who were
raising money for several charities,
had spent the first morning of the
jailbreak fundraising around West
London. After finding themselves
unable to blag any free flights
at Heathrow that evening, they
decided to use some of the money
to buy flights to Turkey.
They were carrying a sign
advertising what they were doing
which mentioned one of their
chosen charities: “Hand in Hand
for Syria”.
Despite being allowed through
airport security and explaining what
they were doing to the staff who
sold them the flights, just before
take-off, a man dressed in a high-
visibility jacket boarded the plane
and approached one member of
the group, asking: “So what’s the
problem?”
Confused, the team were told to
leave the plane and to bring their
IDs. Just outside the cabin, they
were met with a group of armed and
plain-clothes anti-terror police.
Their passports were examined,
with one student’s passport causing
particular upset due to the presence
of a police stamp necessary for a
visa. The three students were then
separated and questioned by police
for forty minutes. Once it became
clear that they weren’t a threat to
anyone, the group were free to go
but were not...
