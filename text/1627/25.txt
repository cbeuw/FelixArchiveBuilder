Medics don’t see vets, Animals do

ollowing a strong home
performance against the
league leaders the previous
week, ICURFC 1s took
on the King’s Medics. The first
challenge of the day reared its head
with the devious Science Museum
impounding our buses (likely
wishing to examine them as they
appear to be older than time itself
and, judging by their condition,
were used in the great siege of Troy).
After breaking through the first
defensive line of the day the boys
reclaimed their chariot and were
on their way to the grimy depths of
South East London.
A big win was needed in order
to maintain the challenge for the
title and, of course, because RVC
girls love a stallion as the author of
this piece well knows. The first five
minutes were relentless from the
boys, giving the medics no room
to breathe. Five minutes gone, five
points scored, courtesy of Mike

The score was 34-15 to IC Rugby 1s in their match against the King’s Medics
Wright who crashed in from short
range.
A bit of sloppy play allowed Kings
to go over in the corner to level the
score. Game on. A strong restart
from IC allowed Tom Hedley to
trundle over from the back of the
maul. Another brilliant piece of
play allowed the towering Josh
O’Donnell to go over in the corner.
I believe there was something about
a scrum try for King’s, but I won’t
go into that for the sake of the
forwards.
Soon IC were able to force the
hand of the ref. The King’s player
saw a yellow. Poor guy, he probably
just fancied a respite from the
unrelenting pummelling. Soon
another IC maul was over the line.
Tom Hedley, once again. It makes
you think that maybe he plans to
stay at the back of the mauls, doesn’t
it?
And then it happened, a moment
of pure brilliance. The ball was
passed out to the faster, more
handsome Bryan Habana, Alex
Tamato (Not DNS). Given some
space, the dashing young speedster
and author of this article, was able
to take on the full-back and with
his silky smooth feet and tiny lady
hips send him the wrong way to
waltz on past him. Amato could see
the line gleaming in front of him
and the chance to finally earn his
father’s love, but alas the opposition
winger just managed to bring him
down. A moment of silence broke
and hearts were in mouths, which
was all rather melodramatic as his
momentum carried him over to
score half a second later.
No. 9, James Field, was taken off
the field so we could field another
scrum half/stroppy toddler, Matt
Blackett. Despite the best efforts of
Blackett and the opposition on the
side of the field, he was unable to
sufficiently piss off the referee and,
much to Field’s disappointment,
remained on the field.
The bonus point confirmed, IC
went for the jugular, knowing that
points difference would likely
decide the league. Ed Durkin took
the ball to the line gifting a try to
none other than Tom Hedley, not
yet as skilled in hat-trick avoidance
as our 2nd
row,Toby Simpson.
Replacement wing, Oli Parker,
met his match as King’s put up an
unlikely attacking high ball down
the wing for their hooker to chase.
Poor Oli could do little to stop the
bumbling knuckle dragger from
plucking the ball from the air and
scoring. Outclassed.
A less than satisfying end to a
mediocre performance from IC,who
know they’ve got more to give.Final
score was 34-15. MOTM, similarly
to Jonathan Joseph at the weekend,
was awarded to Alex Tamato
(who didn’t stop mentioning it to
the RVC girls that night) for an
exceptional performance.

their chariot
L
ast term in the midst of
‘Imperial Girls Can’ week
the ICURFC gentlemen
headed down to Kent
for their last formal game of 2015
in the hope that they could make
the ladies of Imperial proud. With
our eyes set on the league title the
necessity for repeated bonus point
wins cannot be stressed enough; the
pressure was on. The game opened
with a few changes to the regularly
fielded side – most notably in the
backs with Ed Durkin stepping in
at ten. A guest appearance at prop
from Eifion Foster got the horns
blowing when he put Hobson over
the line for the first score of the
game and the second score of his
life. The Sonny-Bill offload brought
an orchestrated applause from the
crowd; an impressive start for IC.
The game evolved gently in the
first half with College chopping
the opposition’s chances of victory
through a driving maul touched
down by Joe McGrail.Club Captain
Charles Price-Smith proved to Link
up well with Moorby in the centres,
bursting through the line for the
third score.
The second half saw the Imperial
boys hunting for that invaluable
bonus point try. The bells rang out
of their head-height towers for
Josh O’Donnell when he slid into
the corner for the fourth try only
to have his dreams swatted as the
referee wrongly disallowed what
was an incredible score. However, it
wasn’t long before this was corrected

by Durkin putting Moorby in
under the posts to give the kicker
a slight chance of converting. The
opposition’s chances of recovery
were receding faster than Clayton’s
hairline when Price-Smith bundled
over for the fifth score of the game.
This reassuring victory for IC has
kept the promotion prospect within
reach – next term would surely see
some thrilling rugby.
