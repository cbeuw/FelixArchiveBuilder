B
limey, what a week! We
love an exclusive here at
FELIX, but even we were
rather surprised that real
hacks from the Evening Standard
and MailOnline took notice of a
story that hasn’t even been on our
front page for two weeks or so.
And bless RAG,because whatever
you think of them, they’ve had a
rough ride of it recently. Not only
was their publication removed and
their arms twisted for an apology
(always a way of getting the most
sincere response) it’s now come to
light that their perfectly innocent
jailbreakers were removed from a
flight to Turkey for raising money
for a charity that helps Syrians. Bit
of a case of mistaken identity, but
this was only realised after they'd
been questioned under Schedule 7
of the Terrorism Act 2000, which
means anyone can be held by police
at a travel hub for up to nine hours
and be questioned without a lawyer,
even if the police have no grounds

for suspicion.
The story’s a happy one though,
because after being released by
armed anti-terror police, which
would have made even this Great
Ormond Street Hospital Charity
enthusiast cry and go home, the
group from RAG decided to brush
themselves off and hitchhike to
Poland. Nice.
Our story on the banning of
boycotts may not immediately
seem like an Imperial friendly
one – the union haven’t voted to
boycott, divest from or sanction
anything since 1984, when the
college hiked prices in the Queen’s
Tower refectory (back then the
union also held ‘porn film nights’ in
the QTR though, so it was a pretty
different time). It's an important
right of local democracies like ours
to choose who we do and don't buy
from, and without this option, local
government is weakened.

In response to 'Rag Mag battle
becomes racism row', Issue 1626
Sir/Madam,
As a former RAG Chair and
someone who was also heavily
mocked in the RAG Magazine, I
find it disingenuous of the Union
to suggest that the targets of RAG’s
satire were chosen based on their
personal characteristics. Although
under my tenure as RAG Chair
we may have chosen not to publish
such content,we must accept that as
people in positions of authority we
become targets for public satire.
To suggest that the Union
President was selected for criticism
on the basis of her gender seems to
me absurd: I am the only person of
colour satirised in the magazine, yet
I do not suggest that this is because
RAG is racist.
Discrimination and victimisation
are indeed truly awful facets of
society that must be stamped out,
both on campus and in the wider
world. Part of doing this includes
ensuring that we only cry ‘racist’
when a person of colour is offended
if they were targeted because of their
skin colour, and that we only shout
‘sexist’ when a woman is criticised
because of her gender. Anything
else is a shameful disservice to those
who have truly suffered such abuse.
Ben Fernando
RAG Chair, 2014-15
It's madam. You know it's
madam. Madam Editor, please.
And yes, it obviously wasn't
sexist. We all know it wasn't, but
if they want to keep saying it was,
let them. Let's just hope it didn't
starve GOSH of an extra dialysis
machine.

In response to 'Your union
president speaks on RAG mag
'sexism'', Issue 1626
Dear Lucinda,
I read your article last week and
would like to reply to some of the
accusations directed at us.
The RAG mag is made to be
accessible and funny. Thus, as the
union president, an article about
you was published as you would be
known by a lot of students.
Having read the article I do not
believe you are ‘singled out’ because
you are a woman and in fact the
article also includes commentary on
other (male) sabbaticals.
Callingthepiecesexistundermines
genuine sexism. It is true that there
is a very distorted ratio at Imperial
and as a woman I am challenged
by this as well. However, this does
not mean you can use your gender
to make yourself the victim in a
case that has nothing to do with
sexism; the article does not even
mention your gender. Rather it is
a satire about your opinions given
at an interview with IC radio and
on social platforms such as Twitter.
It criticises your statements about
Scottish Independence, the UK
and the poor which many found
offensive and racist.
Furthermore, I do not believe this
article is justification for stopping
women entering positions of power
as I believe this article would have
existed whether you were male or
female. As a ‘woman in power’, I am
aware that any position of power
makes you a figurehead and open
to criticisms and satire from other
students.This is an important aspect
of free speech.
This is as true for women as it is
for men.
Freedom of speech, and
indeed freedom of the press, are
fundamental rights as important
as the struggle for equal rights
across genders. By 'banning' this
article and threatening the RAG
committee, the Union have trodden
on these freedoms in a way that goes
against the very principle of the
college's legal obligation to promote
free speech.
I hope you realise that because of
this dispute, a lot of charity money
was lost. We are working with three
charities; GOSH, Porridge and
Rice and British Refugee Councils.
Finally, by condemning the RAG
mag, we have lost valuable publicity
on the largest fundraising week
at Imperial. We cannot express
our dismay at how much was lost
because of this commotion.
I believe men and women are
equal and just because you were
the subject of an article, it does not
mean your gender was.
Kind regards,
RAG Vice Chair of Activities,
Alicia Graham
Whether you think they've
messed up or not, we can all admit
that RAG have had a hard time of
late. Let's just hope the union has
been supporting the committee
through all of this as it as much
as it supports some of its student
sabbaticals.
-Ed.

Your President speaks on RAG mag ‘sexism’
RAG has gone too far, and should take responsibility for putting women off taking on
positions of responsibility

W
ho’s to blame for the
gender imbalance
at Imperial, and
in science and
leadership in general? “Not me”,
you’re thinking. For the vast
majority of you, that’s correct. But
a tiny proportion of our community
fails to recognise their role in
creating that awful reality.
The institutional culture
surrounding gender at Imperial is
not an inevitable fact of life. It is
created, and sustained, by people
around you, right here, right now. In
the same way that no one raindrop
considers itself responsible for the
flood, no one person considers
themselves responsible for the fact
that Imperial can be, on occasion, a
hostile environment for women.
No one
raindrop
considers
itself
responsible
for the
flood
But sometimes, it becomes
possible to pinpoint a single action
or incident that perpetuates this
reality. I can say with complete
confidence that the actions of the
RAG committee in publishing the
RAG mag with offensive content,
based on tired stereotypes about
women and drawing upon aspects
of my personal life, has directly
led to women deciding against
taking up leadership roles in our
student community. I know this
because students that have been
considering a future as Union
President or one of our Deputy
Presidents have now seen how a
tiny minority of our students act.
It’s clear that some individuals think
that tradition justifies bullying, or
that it’s somehow acceptable not
to challenge your peers about what
they say or do, or to refuse to take
personal responsibility.
These actions have led to a female
student withdrawing their run for
a position of leadership, for fear of
being subjected to the same abuse.If
this is the way a few loud voices treat
a woman in leadership, via trollish
stereotyping and personal attacks, it
is not a surprise that other female
students have been discouraged
from aiming for a leadership
position. And so, Imperial’s gender
imbalance lives on for another year.
Being an adult is about taking
responsibility for the consequences
of your actions, and the individuals
involved in writing that piece need
to accept what they have done
and the impact they have had.
As students we all have a duty of
responsibility and mutual respect.
If these values are not upheld and
boundaries are crossed, the people
accountable must confront their
unacceptable behaviour.
Every student is entitled to speak
freely, but the RAG mag is an
attack on this. Freedom of speech
does not equate to freedom from
consequences. This is an issue the
FELIX editor tackled herself in her
editorial on the 29th
of January.
By condemning the article,
Imperial College Union is in
no way preventing RAG from
raising money. As a previous RAG
committee member and a huge
supporter of the society I want them
to be as successful as possible.
However, we want RAG week
to be a success, not a scandal. It is
perverse to argue that raising money
can only be successful by being cruel
and ‘joking’ about natural tragedies.
RAG week charities support victims
of ill health, war and poverty. One
charity, Porridge and Rice, works to
empower Kenyan women to break
free from the cycle of poverty – a
worthy goal, undermined by using
sexist stereotypes as publicity for
fundraising.
The RAG mag writers must take
full responsibility for the reduced
publicity they have caused for
this week of fundraising. They
have potentially discouraged
participation, donations and
sponsorship by tarnishing RAG as
a group that permits and enables
bullying.
We must stop this culture that
accepts bullying, accepts fewer
women leaders, and dresses up
personal attacks as ‘tradition’ or
‘satire’. It is not acceptable for
an article to be written to target
an individual’s personal life, and
even more so depicting someone’s
murder.
I know that the majority of
Imperial students have no time for
bullying, tasteless personal attacks,
and gendered stereotypes masked
as ‘banter’. I am and will always
be proud of the work I’ve done
as Union President to encourage
young women to study science and
to take the challenge of leadership.
I would love to say that equality
can solely be achieved through
outreach projects and publicity, but
they are only half the battle. The
deeper challenge is to confront and
uproot prejudices and structures
that support and enable gendered
attacks on women - even, or
especially, when disguised as ‘banter’
or ‘tradition’. It is just cold, hard
reality that the path to equality
is blocked by damaging habits,
ingrained prejudices, corrosive
behaviours and plain old bullying
and harassment.
I am grateful for the support I
have received - from President Alice
Gast to student groups,societies and
staff,all appalled by the behaviour of
these few individuals. Together, we
will stand up to sexism and bullying
wherever we see it.
The RAG
mag writers
must
take full
responsibility
for the
reduced
publicity
The piece in question, which the
MailOnline subsequently rehashed.
to the national press and back again,
let’s not forget the worst part of
this media storm: the fact that the
Evening Standard’s print edition
called your beloved FELIX an
“official union magazine”.
Take this if you take nowt else: we
are not the union’s, and we’re made
of paper. Never have been, always
will be!
