reated by Aaron
McGruder and based
on the comic strip of
the same name,The
Boondocks is a show that takes
a sharp and satirical look at
American society with an emphasis
on social issues, as well as icons
like Oprah Winfrey and Barack
Obama. It was controversial right
from the start (as you can tell from
the opening line) but it was able
to address hot button issues in
unconventionally humorous ways.
The main characters of the show
are Huey, a 10-year-old mini-
revolutionary named after the
Black Panther Huey P. Newton,
and his 8-year-old brother, Riley,
a would-be gangsta, who live with
their cantankerous grandfather
Robert Freeman.They live in
an affluent white suburb called
Woodcrest, with other supporting
characters, where the main actions
of the show takes place.
The show, in a politically
incorrect and brash manner,
touches and reflects on interesting
and controversial issues like black
culture and race relations among
other things. It’s a show that can
make you really think about deep
issues. It contains a mix of of the
political, social, philosophical
and sentimental, not usually seen
incredibly smart and witty, makes
this one of the few gems of TV.
Three excellent seasons were
made with Aaron McGruder and
one disappointing one without
him. While the show ended long
ago, what remains, at least from
seasons 1-3 is a potent, poignant
and sometimes controversial look
at politics and race in a show that’s
full of laughs.
The Boondocks is available on Adult
Swim
The show is first and foremost,
a comedy and its execution is
plain brilliant. It’s hilarious to see
how much the show parodies or
exaggerates various problems and
incidents. It’s equally entertaining
to see the different shenanigans
the Freeman family get involved
with, whether it’s opening a fast
food restaurant, getting trapped
in jail or going on a hunger strike
against BET. Every episode makes
you laugh at one point or another.
That, and the fact that the show is
in other animated shows.The
character Huey Freeman channels
the creator’s own thoughts and
views, disapproving of how things
currently are and sometimes taking
matters into his own hands.
The show is widely known for
the controversy it whipped up
through bold moves.The n-word
is used very casually in almost
every episode, Martin Luther
King even says it at one point.
McGruder also attacks politicians
and celebrities of every stripe and
race; he is merciless about President
Bush, Sean Combs and Robert
Johnson, the founder of Black
Entertainment Television.The
show also made daring statements
and took harsh stances in trying to
get its message across.
Don’t let all this scare you away.
A show
that takes a
sharp and
satirical look
at American
Society
