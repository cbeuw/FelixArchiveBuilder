SUCCESS
Yesterday afternoon a group of 300 students and
staff gathered in the Pippard Lecture Theatre
to hear Dr. Magnus Pyke, a scientist noted
for his arm-waving gestures on television
give a lecture on " Understandability
of Science".

cribing how the experiment first
tailed, but then worked, he said
"the u n i n h i b i t e d gesture o f
getting it right got me where I
am today".
In answer to questions, D r
Pyke reinforced his view that
science can't answer a l l ques-
tions, e.g. computers could not
govern, and soya beans have not
been accepted. Scientists should
publish their work, as not doing
so held back the development of
mankind.
D r Fyke's lecture was punctu-
ated with many witty remarks
which brought roars of laughter
from his audience. Although he
had no apparatus, he used his
arms often to explain further a
p a r t i c u l a r point. H e received
loud and long applause at the
end. and the lei tine was enjoyed
"enormously by those people
there, although it was suggested
that a larger theatre would have
been more appropriate.

thinking. Mathematicians were
not i n c l u d e d , as they d i d n ' t
bother about facts. Science is
c o n c e r n e d a b o u t o b s e r v a t i o n s
and measurement.
H e spent t w e n t y - f i v e years
working as a biochemist in the
drink industry maximising the
output of Scotch whiskey. Louis
Pasteur started by finding out
why his father-in-law's wine had
fermented, and this led to the
w i d e s p r e a d study o f b a c t e r i a .
Napoleon's war minister's son,
M Carnot discovered the cycle
which bears his name, but it was
not generally known until L o r d
K e l v i n publicised it. T h i s cycle is
used in refrigerators, and out of it
came the generation's greatest
invention — fish fingers, a n d
rockets to the moon, which can
now carry liquid oxygen.
Ultra Vires or not?
There has been heated discussion over the last week as to whether ICU's
affiliation to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament would be legal.
After a motion was passed at the end of last term resolving such
affiliation, it was suggested to John Passmore that such action might be
illegal.
He was given a copy of a 1972 court case "Baldry v Feintuck and others"
before Judge Brightman wherein a student, " a member of the students'
union of Sussex University" made an "application . . . to restrain the use of
union funds for certain purposes said by [the student] to be foreign to the
true purposes of the union". Three members of the exec, were sued on their
own behalf and on behalf of all members ol the union. The action sought to
restrain the defendents from, inter alia, "causing or permitting any
payment to be made out ol the funds of the union for political or charitable
purposes other than those expressly authorised by its constitution or other
purposes ultra vires its constitution".
In his judgment, Judge Brightman, noted the aims of the union, which
included, "to encourage and develop the corporate life of the U n i o n in
cultural, social and athletic fields". He continued, "the union is treated by
the inland revenue authorities as established exclusively for charitable
purposes. The union is accorded tax exemption o n that basis. This
recognition of the union as an educational charity seems to me clearly to be
correct". He explained how the Union A G M passed a budget for the year
which included two payments, one of £500 to War on Want and another
ol £800 to "what I think might be described as a political campaign against
the government's policy of ending free milk lor schoolchildren". The
meeting also altered the aims of the U n i o n for "'promotion of any matter
