C A N O E C L U B spent last weekend surfing on the
Gower in South Wales. On Saturday we surfed at
Rossilli Beach. As this was a beach new to most of
the paddlers we were very pleased to see some of
the best waves that Canoe Club has experienced
for some time. The long beach provided lots of
room and well shaped waves.
The experienced surfers were able to take full
advantage of the good conditions. Those who
were surfing for their first or second time were
developing well, in the conditions well suited for
learning.
In the a f t e r n o o n we r e t u r n e d to Neil
Macmillan's house, where we were staying over
the weekend. We were very grateful to his
parents for their hospitality. In the evening we
made a tour of the local pubs and fish and chips
shop.
On Sunday morning we had a look at Caswell
Bay, but were disappointed with what we found
and so went back to Rosilli Beach. Here the surf
was as good as the previous day. However the
w i n d was m u c h s t r o n g e r and c o l d e r . A
breakaway group led by Trev Jones decided that
it was too cold to go surfing. The majority of
people had a good days surfing, and were not too
cold at the end of it.
Everyone enjoyed a good weekend's surfing, all
gaining experience that will prove valuable for
them during the summer's tour. The next is to the
River Teifi on February 20 and 21.

Rugby Seconds
IC 2nd XV decided this was the day to achieve
the impossibe. Led on to the field by the
dynamic King they were convinced an
unbeated run of two games was possible. In
fact, they slaughtered a Bedford team in a
short sixty minute game.
At the start IC could not understand how
they kept on scoring tries. But eventually they
hit on a plan of "running the ball to the
wings". Despite this strategy the number
eight, Steer, scored three tries and the scrum
half, Johns, scored four tries. Further tries
came from Ball, Bell, Hobday, Hughes-N and
King. Four tries were converted by Sumes.
TEAM: Pullen, Hughes-N, Wall, Hobday,
Symes, Johns, Bell, Ball, Kirby, Bradley,
Toole, Steer, King, Charlton and King.
Football Seconds
IC extracted sweet revenge for last term's cup
defeat with a fine victory against UC
Seconds.
Before UC had even touched the ball, IC
were in front when Hartland completed a
devastating move from inside the penalty
area. IC's confidence soared and, some one
touch football produced two more good
scoring chances. The second vital goal came
when Veenman beat the advancing keeper
with typical coolness to give him his twelve
goal of the season. A thirty yard bullet shot
from Lay then narrowly missed the crossbar
although the traffice could certainly not be
described as 'one way'.
In the second half, with a fresh wind
behind them, UC worked numerous attacks
down both flanks. Wiliams had another fine
game,using all his skill and judgment to leave
the two that hit the bar (!) and making several
reflex saves. The'whole IC side battled
superbly for every loose ball and thoroughly
deserved the victory which has now put them
top of the upper reserves league.
T E A M : Williams, Dunhill, Beer, Merritt,
Griffiths, Lakin, Lay, Wiggins, Veenman,
Hartland, Saunders.
