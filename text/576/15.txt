Above, is a tabulated summary of the head tenancies (inc. No. 9) showing
numbers of units of different sizes each has to offer.
21 Redcliffe Street
The Redcliffe Street house has been set aside as
as postgraduate house whereas other head
tenancies can be applied to by both under-
graduates and postgraduates. It is situated at the
lower end of Earls Court but still within walking
distance of College. The house consists mainly of
single bedsits with a communal lounge and
kitchen.
9 Princes Gardens
9, FYinces Gardens is N O T a head tenancy but
since it contains the only flats that the College is
able to offer in its own residences, it seems
appropriate that it should be applied for together
with the other flats. The main difference between
the Princes Gardens flats and the head tenancy
ones is that it counts as a year in College
residence whereas the others do not.
What will you be paying

7b Head Tenancies
Points to remember
Applications for flats will only be accepted from
groups. This means that if you want to live in a flat
or a double room/flatlet, you will need to apply as
a group of two, three, four, five, six, seven or
eight. If you apply on your own, you can only be
considered for a single room/flatlet.
If you are also applying to a Hall of Residence
or to a Student House, your application to the
Hall or House will be withdrawn once you have
been allocated a place in a Head Tenancy.
You may only make one application to head
tenancies.
This means that if, for example, you apply in a
g r o u p , you cannot also make a separate
application on your own, nor can you make an
applicaiton with another group.
H O W T O A P P L Y
Group Applications
1. You will need: one orange form for the whole
group and a white card for each member of the
group — so a group of four would need one
orange form and four white cards.
2. Look through the table of Head Tenancies and
see which ones have accommodation suhabk for
a group of your size^ If there is more than one,
place them in order of preference by writing 1 or 2
in the appropriate spaces on the form. K tnere is
only one put T in the appropriate space.
3. Fill in the rest of the orange form
How to Apply
4. E a c h member of the group must then
complete a white card.
5. Return the orange form together with A L L the
white cards to the Student Services Office by
Friday, March 13, 1981.
NB: Applications will only be accepted if the
orange form and all the white cards are handed in
together.
Single Applications
1. Y o u will need one orange form and one white
card.
2. Lexham Gardens and Earls Court Square
both have accommodation suitable for people
applying on their own. The chart shows the
number of places that each has. Indicate your
preference by placing '1' or '2' in the appropriate
places.
3. Return the completed form and card to the
Student Services Office, 15 Princes Gardens by
Friday, March 13, 1981.
General Points
1
. The way the allocation system works, the
chances are that you will either get your first
choice or nothing.
2. If you are applying in a group, experience has
shown that problems arise when smokers share
with non-smokers. Please give this point careful
consideration when choosing your group.
All students who accept accommodation in
double rooms and flats will be jointly and severally
r e s p o n s i b l e for the whole rent for their
accommodation. This means that if one member
of the group moves out, the remainder will have
the choice of paying the whole rent themselves or
finding a replacement. Any person intending to
move out must give twenty-eight days notice in
writing to the other members of the group and to
the Student Services Office or pay rent in lieu of
notice.
To Halls & Houses
There are different forms to fill in depending on
whether you are applying as a reapplicant, a
postgraduate new applicant or an undergraduate
new applicant. Make sure that you pick up the
right form and return the completed form to the
Student Services Office by the appropriate
closing date.
