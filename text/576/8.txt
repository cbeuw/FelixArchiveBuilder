A N D Y E T A N O T H E R fiasco of a U G M bites the
dust. The next U G M is the Hustings U G M on
March 5.
Overseas Students
The Finance and Executive Committees met on
Friday to discuss amongst other things fees for
overseas students, for the next session. After
some discussion it was agreed by the Committee
members that fees for undergraduate and
research courses would be the minimum, i.e.
£2,500 for Maths and £3,600 for all others and for
advanced courses (MSc to us mere mortals) the
fee will be £4,000. This apparently is to test the
market. I cannot quite see the point in charging
£400 extra, but the Governors couldn't quite see
the point in charging £400 less.
I then a s k e d if some courses could be
subsidized for Third World students, the Rector
asking in response if the U n i o n would be
prepared to forego part of its budget to pay for it.
The Rector did say that the fees are laid down
by Government and in the present economic
climate it is impossible to charge less. This is what
we are up against (a Tory Government that is).
On Greek students, both myself and Bob
Bradley stressd the position of the first year
Greeks in particular, but the Committee decided
not to refund any money, but to consider any
G r e e k students who are in hardship in a
favourable light. One point was made about giving
money back to the sons of Greek shipowners.
PGs
I mentioned the questionnaire at Board of Studies
in particular the problem of supervisors and was
met by stoney silence. The Rector asked me to
prepare a document to be included in the Board
of Studies minutes and I will raise the matter in
departments.
Nuclear Fuel Technology
Several students and I met the Rector on Monday
to discuss Nuclear Technology and after about
one hour of useful discussion we left to consider
the next move. This is likely to be at Board of
Studies.
Bye for N O W .
Stop
Smoking
A clinic will be held at the College Health
Service on Fridays at 12:30, commencing
February 20,1981. This will last for about
an hour, or just over.
If you would like some help with stopping
the dreaded weed and to smell nice like your
friends, ring G a y Challands on 4271 (internal)
to book a place. The first course will last for
five weeks and there will be two follow-up
sessions next term.
Numbers will be limited — so BOOK NOW.

O N T U E S D A Y , February 17 "The War Game"
will be shown in Physics LT1 at 1:00pm.
The film, made by Peter Watkins for the B B C ,
depicts the effects of a nuclear attack on Britain
— and has been banned from television since its
completion in 1965. The reason originally given
being that it was "too horrifying for the medium of'
broadcasting''.
Kenneth Tynan of the Observer, one of the few
who saw it then, said: "I suspect that it may be the
most important film ever made. Given wide
enough dissemination, I believe it might change
the course of history".
L o r d N o r m a n b r o o k , C h a i r m a n of B B C
Governors, had this to say: "This f i l m . . . is based
on careful research into official material. I have
seen the film and can say that it has been
produced with considerable restraint. But the film
is necessarily alarming, and the showing of the
film on television might well have a significant
effect on public attitudes towards the policy of
nuclear deterrent. In these circumstances I doubt
whether the B B C ought alone to take the
responsibility of deciding whether this film should
be shown on television... It seems to me that the
Government should have an opportunity of
expressing a view about this".
T h e G o v e r n m e n t duly decided it would
"prefer" the B B C not to screen it officially
because of the possible effects on vulnerable and
sensitive people. Private showings, however have
continued to draw large audiences — while
technical details may change the picture of
individual suffering in nuclear war remains the
same. Mary Whitehouse has said of the banning
that it "was one of the most enlightened decisions
made in recent television history". We cannot
agree. Please come along on Tuesday and decide
for yourself. v

Pimlico
Connection
T H E PIMLICO C O N N E C T I O N was set up five
years ago, as a tutoring scheme with the idea of
increasing the c o m m u n i c a t i o n of scientific
knowledge.
It involves tutoring children (either at
secondary or primary schools) for a couple of
hours on Wednesday afternoons during the
autumn and half the spring term. This year there
were over seventy of us operating at four local
schools.
Undergraduate and Postgraduate tutors are
needed for the 1981/2 session starting September
1981. No previous experience needed and all
travel expenses paid.
If you think you'd be interested then come and
see me or Dr Sinclair Goodlad, Room 501, Elec
Eng, Int 3080, Messages G P O 940 4466.
Thanks.

Notice
Two boxes of Kodachrome slides were
delivered in mid-January addressed Imperial
College. The slides depict scenes of mountains
and lakes, not in Britain. If you think the slides
belong to you then get in touch with the FELIX
Office for further information.
