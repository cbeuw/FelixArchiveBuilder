Southside
Refectory
T H E U N I O N Permament W o r -
king Party has made a number of
r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s c o n c e r n i n g
C o l l e g e refectories. These re-
sulted from investigations after
the p l a n n e d c h a n g e s to the
Southside R e f e c t o r y c o m p l e x
were suggested by College, which
included proposals to incorporate
a post-experience centre in place
of the Refectory.
The committee agrees that the
S o u t h s i d e o u t l e t w h o u l d be
h e a v i l y r e d u c e d , the 3 0 0 / 4 0 0
meals it serves per day could
easily be supplied by the other
refectories. The Sherfield Refec-
tory, the committee argues, is
ought to remain almost the same
still able to cater for f o r m a l
functions. It is proposed that the
Buttery should stop serving hot
food a n d instead s^rve snack
foods a n d s a l a d s , t h o u g h it
should be open all day to provide
a continuous service. P W P feel
that the U n i o n r e f e c t o r y is
satisfactory and that here there is
no real need for change.
These recommendations still
require C o u n c i l approval before
they b e c o m e o f f i c i a l U n i o n

Nuclear
Arms Race
L A S T T H U R S D A Y , Prof Pentz,
of the O p e n University, gave a
talk about the present status of
the nucelar arms race. H e argued
that the U S has consistently led
the race, with the U S S R fran-
tically trying to catch up. We are
now at a critical point, since the
introduction of further missiles
and particularly Cruise and M X
systems would threaten to make
the arms race irreversible. This is
•because it is very difficult for
either side to verify that the
opposite side is keeping to an
arms limitation agreement when
the missiles are very small or
mobile. H e concluded by em-
phasising the role people with a
scientific education should play
in countering the distortions and
misuse of statistics which regu-
l a r l y o c c u r i n this area. T h e
lecture was well attended and
lively.

Rumpus
L A S T S A T U R D A Y , IC's inter-
H a l l R a g competition took place.
Students from all Halls parti-
cipated in the hope of winning a
free barrel of beer for their H a l l .
Some went to Trafalgar Square
to be "foamed" for 20p, whilst
others stuck to the more usual
haunt of Harrods. The event was
" w o n " by an ad-hoc group from
Chemistry 2, not living in H a l l ,
who collected over £290.
F E L I X moles discovered that
at least three Halls had con-
s i d e r e d c h e a t i n g b y a d d i n g
amounts to their total, from H a l l
funds, in the hope of winning by
underhand scheming and devi-
ous methods.

Stop
Thief!
A F L A T in 9 Princes Garden was
b r o k e n i n t o o n W e d n e s d a y
afternoon. The door wasjemmied,
and an amount of small jewellery
was stolen. The theft occured
between 4:30 and 5:00pm on
Wednesday. The victims asked
a n y o n e w h o s a w s u s p i c i o u s
people in Princes Gardens to get
in touch with the police. This was
the second theft in two days from
IC premises. A n Opsoc member
had £50 stolen on the Tuesday
afternoon from some unattended
possessions in the U n i o n Building.
The message seems to be 'Watch
Out — There's a thief about".

Ultra Vires or not?
whatsoever of interest to its members'". He went on by saying "the union is,
clearly, an educational charity and the officers of the union who have
power to dispose of the union's funds are, clearly, trustees of those funds for
charitable educational purposes. It is not, therefore, open to the union, by a
purported amendment of its constitution, to authorise the use of the union's
funds for the purpose of promoting any object which may happen to
interest the members of the union regardless of whether such object is
charitable and educational or not . . . that is a result which no charitable
body such as the union is capable of achieving."
"It is plainly proper and desirable that students should consider and
discuss social and economic problems of the day; that is part of the
educational process." Counsel for the defendents submitted that "students
are not bound to confine expenditure to matters which . . . are more
directly concerned with their own personal interest. It is right that they
should be able to give up a reasonable part of their union's moneys as a
concrete expression of their corporate views. . . It should not be confined to
oral expression, but should include a reasonable financial expression".
The Judge said: " I do not think that he is right as a matter of law. If the
members of the union wish to express their views financially, that money
should come from their own personal funds and not from trust money.
Admittedly, part of the educational process is research, discussion, debate
and reaching a corporate conclusion on social and economic problems, but,
in my view, the provision of money to finance the adoption outside the
university of that corporate conclusion does not form any part of the
educational process."
" I turn to the proposed milk campaign fund. That is, admittedly,
according to the literature, a political purpose. It is, therefore, inevitably
not a charitable purpose, educational or otherwise, because political
purposes are not charitable. It follows on that count alone that charitable
funds cannot lawfully be used for setting up such a fund. Charitable funds
cannot be applied to non-charitable purposes".
Expert advice
F E L I X sought the opinion of a member of the Inns of Court on this
matter. He referred to this case, and the Charity Commission report for
1972. He said that this all revolved around the principle of "esjudem
generis" that limits the way in which words which indicate various fields
can be construed. For instance, I C U by-laws l b and lc give the Union
objects as "the encouragement of interest by students in matters outside the
College curriculum, especially cultural and athletic interests" and "the
provision of a corporate body of students . . . to represent and to safeguard
and advance the interests and welfare of the students of the Imperial
College". Whilst it may be argued that a campaign to save I C U from
nuclear obliteration would "safeguard the interests and welfare of the
students", the words could not be interpreted in a law court in this way.
Also, the President cannot place bets on Irish sweepstakes with Union
money. He said it was not charitable to advocate reform, and added "for
such an overtly political and controversial group as C N D , the decision was
clear cut, such payments are ultra vires". He said the case was heard in the
court of first instance, i.e. no appeal was made against it. It stands as legal
precedent, and any judge hearing a similar application would have to
follow that precedent.
President to be sued
Meanwhile in Leeds, the University Union President, Chris Shenton, is
lacing legal action because he has not made payments that he claims are
ultra vires. This matter arose in October when the Third World Society
proposed a motion to donate £700 to build a school in Gambia. There is a
difference of opinion between the Union solicitors, the law department,
and the college solicitors as to if this would be ultra vires. A leading
member of the Third World Society is filing a Court Order against M r
Shenton, asking that he be directed to allow the donation to be made. M r
Shenton said "It is the charitable status and not the Union constitution
which is preventing the donation to G a m b i a " .
The N U S has published a pamphlet called "Student Unions and Ultra
Vires". It states: "It should be stressed that in considering any payments by
charitable students' unions the courts would refer to objections acceptable
to the Charity Commisioners, and not solely the union's own constitutional
objects clause . . . To act as if legal constraints on unions do not really exit .
. . would not only be shortsighted, but also highly irresponsible to the
membership. If any one studens union is found by the courts to be making
ultra vires payments this would have implications for the whole student
movement".
F E L I X asked John Passmore if he had heard from the Union Solicitors.
He rang the solicitor on Wednesday afternoon, who said that there was
nothing in the bylaws either way, and he would have to read the
constitution before expressing an opinion. M r Passmore presumed the
solicitors had read the relevent case.
The affiliation fee I C U would have to pay is only £10, but most people
involved agree that "it's the principle that matters".
