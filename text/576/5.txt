A smuggler's journey into the Zone, a forbidden
wasteland where dreams come true.
Certificate A. Starring Aleksandr
Kaidanovsky. Directed by Andrei
Tarkovsky. Now showing at the Academy
Cinema, Oxford St. (Subtitled).
A thin, pale figure with closely cropped hair
awakes beside his wife and daughter in a dirty,
noisy room. He dresses, ready to leave, but his
wife stops him. She knows where he is going
and pleads for him to stay.
The Stalker is a strange emotional figure,
one of a few whose gift is safely to guide people
into the Zone — an area formed after the
landing of a meteorite which is deserted and
prohibited to enter. It is rumoured that at the
centre of the Zone is a Room in which all of
ones innermost desires can be fulfilled. Hence
it is guarded by a terrifying military regime.
S t a l k e r agrees to guide tw o p e o p l e ,
identified only as the Writer and the Professor
into the Zone.
Starting off in a bland sepia tint, this is the
opening of Andrei Tarkovsky's latest film.
Better known for Solaris, Tarkovsky is a
skilled and interesting Russian film maker
whose outstanding visual sense is backed by
an almost irritating narrative, which leaves
m u c h to the viewer's o w n interpretation.
When the three enter the Zone, the screen
bursts (not quite spectacularly) into colour and
scenes of industrial desolation outside are
contrasted with the serenity and beauty of the
Z o n e . Y e t , a s S t a l k e r e x p l a i n s , it is a
dangerous place full of traps and only with his
help can people safely reach the Room.
T h e b u l k of the film d e a l s w i t h t h e
development of the three central characters as
they journey forward; the Writer is impatient,
frustrated, while the Professor is quiet and
thoughtful. Their reasons for risking death in
the Zone are examined, as well as the Stalker's
own immovable faith.
Visually stunning at times, the film is a little
long winded (2hrs 41mins) and yet maintains
an air of suspense and expectation which
make it all worthwhile. I enjoyed it just as much
afterwards — thinking about the h i d d e n
meanings and implications of the plot — and
yet it will not appeal to those seeking action-
packed 'hardware' science fiction. A different,
interesting and well photographed film.

and her timing during the
moments when she consults

be a natural gift. However,

decision to use the spare green
spotlight adds to the effect.

RUDDIGORE
by Gilbert and Sullivan
There is still time to enjoy our very own
presentation of Ruddigore. T h e last two
performances are tonight and on Saturday, at
7:30 p.m. in the Union Concert Hall. Tickets are
£1:20 to students (several are still available on
the door for Friday and Saturday's shows).
The Producer, Roger Woodward and Musical
Director, Richard Pigg, have led a team of over
80 students in the current Operatic Society
production of Ruddigore which is 'nearly' a
success. The first night, o n Tuesday, lacked
sparkle but with a responsive audience tonigh<
the cast may be encouraged to let themselves
go.
Sally Donegani, as M a d Margaret, has already
reached the target with her imaginative
performance. Ellis Pike is well cast as the wicked
baronet. Liz Bundy, plays Rose Maybud, the
chorus).
