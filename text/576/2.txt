Dear Steve
In reply to D V Molesworth's
letter of last week, I would like to
make several points.
South Africa has been domin-
ated by an oppressive regime for
many years, during which time
the whites have exploited the
blacks and the natural resources
of their country (and those of
Namibia) to create an industrial-
ized nation.
N o w however they are .becom-
ing aware that if they are to keep
u p w i t h , t h e o t h e r w e s t e r n
industrialized nations, they have
to f i n d s k i l l e d w o r k e r s f r o m
outside the boundaries of the
white ruling class. T h e y have
several options: 1) to i m p o r t
whites from countries like Britain
a n d I n s t i t u t i o n s l i k e I m p e r i a l
College; 2) to try and divide the
internal ethnic groups and to
train, say, the asians (although
such policies would not be liked
by hard-line Afrikaaners, and
would probably flounder, when
faced with black loyalty inside
these ethnic groups); 3) to train
and educate black people. This
l a s t o p t i o n t h e y l i k e l e a s t ,
b e c a u s e a n e d u c a t e d b l a c k
working class, perhaps in control
of vital sections of the economy
would be a very potent internal
enemy. Also black people already
have strong organisations and a
great deal of solidarity, and in
order to get these people to work
for them, they would have tp
i n t r o d u c e s u b s t a n t i a l reforms
first.
This is the situation facing
graduates who could go to South
Africa; they will be helping the
racists and postponing the end of
apartheid.
Most graduates from Imperial
admit apartheid to be morally
u n j u s t i f i a b l e , but believe the
system to be libralising. However
they neglect to ask themselves
why any system changes. O p -
pressors, who have an advantage
in maintaining a particular state
o f a f f a i r s ( w h i c h w o u l d be
I m p e r i a l students' p o s i t i o n i n
SA) do not institute reforms out
of kindness. The force for change
is the oppressed group and it's
allies.
In South Africa the oppressed
group is the black population; it's
allies are the third world countries
w h o have p u s h e d resolutions
t h r o u g h the U n i t e d N a t i o n s
forcing mandatory arms embar-
goes, etc., the front-line states
w h o offer shelter to p o l i t i c a l
refugees a n d k e e p a l i v e the
d r e a m of f r e e d o m , a n d the
solidarity organisations like the
A n t i - A p a r t h i e d G r o u p w h i c h
operate in those countries whose
governments do not already give
full s u p p o r t to the l i b e r a t i o n
movements.
If the students of I m p e r i a l
College wish to see an end to
injustice, they must become allies
of the black people, and those
people, t h r o u g h t h e i r o r g a n -
izations S W A P O and the A N C
are clear: they say stay at home,
to come to South Africa is to side
with the racists.

Dear Sir
I w r i t e i n response to last
week's letter, which supported
firms r e c r u i t i n g graduates to
work in South Africa.
It may not be fair to discrim-
inate against t h e m , but then
neither is it fair for the firms
themselves to discriminate against
black people. They do need to
to recruit abroad when unem-
ployment among South African
blacks is running at 25%. M u r r a y
and Roberts G r o u p at least, and
many others I should think, do
not recruit black employees from
Britain (a British firm exercising
the same rascist policy could be
p r o s e c u t e d u n d e r the R a c e
R e l a t i o n s A c t ) . B l a c k S o u t h
A f r i c a n s , for d o i n g the same
work, do not receive the same
amount of pay as whites, despite
the profits that these firms are
making.
I doubt that many of these
firms are significantly narrowing
the gaps between blacks a n d
whites standards of living. A n d
even if they are, this is not a
solution to the South African
problem. I have spoken to people
who lived in South Africa, and
what they have told me surprises
my own faith in human nature.
I suggest to students of this
C o l l e g e , as m e m b e r s of the
U n i o n , that they are at least
partly responsible for the various
w a y s i n w h i c h the C o l l e g e
supports the Apartheid system in
South Africa.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
I write in response to the letter
in F E L I X no 576, from D R
Morris. H e appears to believe
that I a m not Jesus Christ. A t
first sight, this w o u l d a p p e a r
r e a s o n a b l e . H o w e v e r , I c a n
testify that he has at no time
actually checked that this is so,
w h i c h u n d e r m i n e s his case
somewhat. I would also like to
say that I repudiate the sentiments
expressed by Paul in his letter to
the R o m a n s . H e o b v i o u s l y
disliked humanists and homo-
sexuals, and temporarily ignored
the teachings of old J C about
l o v e ( s o m e t h i n g w h i c h M r
Morris has little of for his fellow
m e n it seems). P r e s u m i n g to
know the mind of G o d is a sin of
which Paul was often guilty. A
more fruitful Bible study might
be of Elijah, in which several
children are torn apart by wild
bears for jeering at the prophet,
or the Incarnation, which says
many sensible things about how
to behave, which many world
leaders would do well to read.
But Romans?! Fire and b r i m -
stone! M r M o r r i s would have to
believe in the devil to take it as
fact. A h well, he'd better take
that up with my pal D a m i e n
Thorne.
Yours Eternally
Jesus Christ

Dear Sir
T h e m a g i c n u m b e r strikes
again and another I C U G M bites
the dust.
The call of quorum is rather
r e m i n i s c e n t of the n a u s e o u s
effects of a scratched record. O n
the o t h e r h a n d , t h o s e w h o
advocate discretion when faced
with inquoracy pave the way for
a vindictive quorum call before
a vote which looks like "going the
wrong way". In similar vein, the
ignominious tactic of stopping
things "going the wrong w a y " by
organising a walk-out (to produce
inquoracy) has been successfully
applied in past years.
Perhaps someone can explain
to me why 299 students unani-
mously supporting a motion is
invalid, whereas a vote of 151 to
149 is supposed to give a true
reflection of the views of the
College population?
O n a m o r e e x t r e m e l e v e l ,
p r o v i d e d 2 9 0 s t u d e n t s a r e
prepared to sit dormant in the
Great H a l l , a vote of six to four
has the power to make or break
U n i o n policy.
I suggest, therefore, that a
m i n i m u m number of votes be
required to pass a motion.
T o this end I will propose by-
law changes to the effect that: the
q u o r u m for an I C U G M be
deleted, motions should be passed
by a simple majority with not less
than 150 votes in favour of the
motion, by-law changes should
be p a s s e d b y a t w o - t h i r d s
majority with not less than 200
votes in favour of the by-law
change.
These changes would pre-empt
quorum calls to prevent a vote,
and organised walk-outs.
If a meeting were attended by
over 300 (the present quorum),
the only effect of these proposals
w o u l d be to p r e v e n t p o l i c y
making by small votes.
If less than 300 were to attend,
any motion passed would have
been passed even if 300 were
present.
I welcome any comment on
these proposals and suggestions
to amend them.
Cheers my dears and thanks
for reading this tedious letter.

Dear Steve
L i k e m a n y p e o p l e , I was
appalled at the low turnout at
last week's U G M , and in response
to L i z Lindsay's appeals, I would
l i k e to offer some ideas o n
improving attendance:
1. Put Exec Mews in with the
last F E L I X before the U G M , or
better still, print Exec Mews as a
pull-out part of F E L I X . T h e n
everyone who takes F E L I X takes
Exec Mews as well.
2. K e e p the posters simple.
The last ones showing the cats
was was well drawn, admittedly,
b u t t h e y j u s t d o n ' t get the
message cross clearly enough.
Just the letters U - G - M and the
time and place are sufficient,
printed on day-glo.
3. F i x the dates of the U G M s
at the start of each session so that
it is possible for bye-law changes
to be read twice without having
to change previously announced
arrangements. H a v i n g fixed the
dates, fine any society organising
an event at the same time.
4. L e a f l e t the r e f e c t o r i e s
fifteen to thirty minutes before
the U G M . That way people have
no excuse for not coming if they
had nothing better to do in the
lunch-hour. If it sounds a bit last-
minute-ish, it'does work.
I will discuss these ideas with
L i z if she thinks they'll do any
good â€” but I know they will.
Yours sincerely
