Dear Comrade Editor
In defence of the people's
rights, I feel compelled to put pen
to p a p e r w i t h r e g a r d to the
disgraceful public performance of
ourcomrade, Honorary Secretary,
L i z Lindsay, a member of the
Executive of the people, more
commonly known as the 'gang of
three'. O n cross examination at
the last U G M on her lamentable
r e c o r d on U G M a t t e n d a n c e ,
o n l y one o f w h i c h has been
q u o r a t e this y e a r , instead of
giving any explanation whatso-
ever to the assembled few, she
proceeded to behave like an Irish
version of the M o u n t St Helens
v o l c a n o . T h i s p e r f o r m a n c e
clearly satisfied no one and her
only suggestion of setting up yet
a n o t h e r c o m m i t t e e is c l e a r l y
ludicrous. As our comrade editor
has previously pointed out in our
people's weekly, F E L I X , the last
U G M was badly planned, poorly
attended and had very little of
interest to the bulk of the student
body. W h i l e I accept that E l
Salvador may be important to
L a t i n A m e r i c a n Soc a n d the
Foreign Office, it has very little
in common with the average IC
student. F o r a change let's see a
l i t t l e p o s i t i v e i n d e p e n d a n t
thought from the executive to
solve this problem, instead of
trying to blame the situation on
everyone but themselves.
L o n g live the revolution.
Comrade Bill the M o l e .
Dear Sir
It is hard to make any criti-
cisms of the way the U n i o n is
going without it being interpreted
as some sort of narrow personal
attack. Clearly my comments at
the last U G M have been mis-
understood. I do not think that
the frequently low attendance of
U G M s is d u e to i n s u f f i c i e n t
publicity or any other technical
matter. In this area I feel that all
c o n c e r n e d ( L i z L i n d s a y i n
particular) have worked hard
and have done all that can be
expected of them. Neither do I
approve of people calling quorum
as a m a t t e r of c o u r s e . S u c h
actions should be reserved for
controversial issues where the low
attendance means that it would
be wrong to take a decision that
s o m e p e o p l e w o u l d s t r o n g l y
oppose.
T h e point is that U G M s are
only a part of a process. Unless
there are campaigns or issues that
are b e i n g a r g u e d about a n d
acted upon in between U G M s ,
no a m o u n t of p u b l i c i t y w i l l
attract people. It is worthwhile
noting that the previous U G M
h a d an e n o r m o u s attendance
(around 600). This was because
three issues were to be discussed
around which there had pre-
viously been activity and contro-
versy: F E L I X ' s editorial policy,
nuclear disarmament issues, and
the South African connection
with the Nuclear Technology
course. It was in this context that
I pointed out the inadequate
action on previous U G M decisions
(for instance, on overseas student
fees). Clearly this is not solely the
sabbaticals' responsibility, but
they should provide a lead and
be clear about what is to be done
and who (not necessarily them-
selves) will do it. In fact things
have been left in the air. Some
sense of urgency is required.
T h e main point is not that the
sabbaticals are not working hard.
I a m sure they are. But there is a
danger that all their time is spent
in administrative details so that
o p p o r t u n i t i e s to i n n o v a t e or
change things, or take part in
broader movements, are neglec-
ted. They must recognise that
this problem exists before there is
any chance of overcoming it.
It is an exasperating habit to
blame low attendances on "too
m u c h politics". The only solution
is to have a campaigning Union.
I n s t e a d of b l a m i n g things on
those who are already active on
issues a b o u t w h i c h they feel
strongly it would be helpful if
other people identified some of
those much referred to "rele-
v a n t " issues and got moving on
them.
In view of the above, I don't
feel that the proposed working
party on U G M attendance is
relevant to the problem and will
not join it. However, along with
m a n y othe r p e o p l e in C N D ,
Overseas students societies, A n t i -
Apartheid club, I C W A , Amnesty
International, W I S T , Socialist
Society, L a b o u r C l u b , Liberal
C l u b , external affairs committee,
etc., I shall continue to work to
make U G M s meaningful and
well attended.

Dear Sir
The amount of interest in the
Disarmament issue seen in the
high attendance at last term's
U G M , a n d the fact that the
motion proposing affiliation to
C N D was passed by such a large
m a j o r i t y , showed c l e a r l y the
depth of feeling within College
over this subject.
It has now emerged ( F E L I X
575), two U G M ' s l a t e r , that
there may be a legal problem in
a f f i l i a t i n g the U n i o n to the
national C N D . U n i o n affilation
to n a t i o n a l groups is h a r d l y
w i t h o u t p r e c e d e n t , yet y o u r
r e p o r t i m p l i e s it has b e e n
successfully challenged just once;
in 1972. The President should
therefore urgently inquire into
the means employed by other
Unions to avoid court cases. It
may be possible, for example, to
pay affiliation fees indirectly —
from the profits produced by
p i n b a l l m a c h i n e s , say, or by
setting up a fund from student
donations.
I n s t e a d of p r o c r a s t i n a t i n g
s u r e l y the P r e s i d e n t , w h e n
mandated to carry through a
certain policy, should employ all
the means at his disposal to do so
— a n d keep the U n i o n a n d
relevant groups w i t h i n it i n -
formed as to his progress.

Dear Stephen
I should like to protest (with all
possible vehemence) about the
s c u r r i l o u s (and t o t a l l y prece-
dented) attack on the integrity of
the I C U n i o n President which
appeared in your most recent
Editorial. After a l l , there are still
five months left, and somebody
might call for a re-run.
Personally, I would be devas-
tated to receive any proof that a
single suspect action had escaped
the attention of eagle-eyed R J
Stotesbury and his tireless team
d u r i n g last year's s a b b a t i c a K
elections.
H e l l o to a l l b e m u s e d first

Dear Sir
In your Editorial of last week,
you implied that J o h n (Dogs of
War) Passmore's election cam-
p a i g n was not t o t a l l y a b o v e
board. If there was any illegality
and you knew of it and yet chose
not to point it out to the elections
committee at that time, does this
i m p l y g u i l t by c o n s p i r a c y on
your part?
Tours sincerely
