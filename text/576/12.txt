UGM Rumpus
I note with interest that John Passmore has
dismissed the latest U G M flop with as few as
ten words in his " O l d Preversions" article. This
contrasts with nearly two pages of letters on
the same topic in this issue.
I suggest M r . Passmore is not taking the
matter as seriously as some of the non-paid
members of the union.
The problem of inquorate U G M s is not new,
but it has never been quite as bad as it is this
year. Often meetings used to end with a
q u o r u m c a l l after a b o u t 90 m i n u t e s of
business; now, they hardly start.
It would be foolish to dismiss low attendance
as apathy. Many people choose not to attend -
they are simply not interested. L i z Lindsay
often blames the low attendance on exams -
there is a certain amount of truth in this, but
just how many of those with exams would have
gone otherwise?
The problem, as I see it, is that there are far
too few motions of a wide student interest
being presented. In saying this, I do not want
to restrict the U G M s subject matter, but
would like to see a lively mix of interesting
motions. After all, the boring tedious motions
that get submitted from time to time can
always be dismissed at the discretion of the
meeting. But, firstly you need to attain the
quorum.
O n e of the Exec's main functions is to
advance the Union, not just to keep it ticking
over. They are hindered in this aim by their
own lack of vitality at U G M s . J o h n Passmore
is at best dull and incomprehensible, Rae Snee
is barely audible and Liz Lindsay nurses a
persecution complex from start to finish. The
C C U Presidents are content to rant in jocular
mood about how many pints were consumed
at the last bar night.
If the Exec, have nothing of interest to say,
why should anyone bother to turn up to listen?
After all, they could be watching S T O I C or
something.
So there are two points to consider:
(1) H o w to get more interesting motions
submitted, and
(2) H o w to get the Exec, to take more
interest themselves.
(1) relies on the imagination and flair of IC
students and hence is doomed to failure.
(2) relies on the Exec, exuding sparkle and
d e t e r m i n a t i o n to solve the p r o b l e m , a n d
depends on their acting abilities.

The War Games
O n Tuesday, the C N D Group are showing
"The War Game". This is a very controversial
and well-made film which I recommend you all
see. It's an opportunity not to be missed as the
film only pops up now and again.
While the film reflects what I feel is probably a
true image of nuclear war, I cannot agree with
the C N D G r o u p that it puts a good case for
disarmament. Nuclear weapons are here to
stay whether we like it or not. Total world
d i s a r m a m e n t is pie in the sky. T h e only
deterrent on offer is possession.
I agree with the C N D people that the film
should be shown on television but certainly not
tomorrow, or next week. Before that, the
public must be educated sensibly of the effects
of a nuclear strike. "The War G a m e " does not
pull its punches. M y main criticism of the film
and reason for it not being shown on television
overnight is that it offers no hope of any kind
for post-war survivors. Unless the general
public is educated in these matters "The W a r
G a m e " could be right.

O n Valentine's Day, Eff, Gee, Aitch and Eye
each received a card, and by studying the
handwriting, each worked out who had sent it
to h i m . A n d so, w h e n the four of them
gathered in the pub that evening, each one
rather smugly revealed that he had received a
Valentine from the wife of one of the other
three. None of them mentioned which lady had
sent the card, merely that she was the wife of
one of the others.
T h e i r s m u g n e s s t u r n e d to an u n e a s y
reticence as it became obvious to each of them
that his own wife must have sent a Valentine to
one of his friends. It was, after all, common
knowledge that after the unpleasantness, at the
Christmas party M r s Aitch wanted nothing
more to do with Eff any more than Mrs. Eye was
interested in Gee. Certainly they would not
consider sending them Valentines.
All four being reasonable logicians, they
tried to think it through, and before long one of
them had deduced that one of the others could
work out who sent each card. W h o did send
which cards to whom?

Last Week's Solution
Rose should allow Despard to move first.
Each side should try to move so that the
number of straight (i.e. transverse) paths
joining Rose to Despard is a multiple of three.
A little experimenting should convince you
that this strategy always produces a win for
whoever moves second, provided the total
numbers of straight paths in the whole ring is
divisible by three.
If it is not divisible by three, Despard can
force a win. In this case if Rose moves so the
number of straight paths between her and
Despard is divisible by three in accordance
with the usual strategy, then the number of
such paths counting the other way round the
ring will not be divisible by three, and Despard
will be able to abduct her by going right round
the circle and attacking from the other side.
Despard's strategy after abducting Rose is
left as an exercise for the reader.
The winner is Damian Hassan, Maths 3, who
can collect his £5 from the F E L I X Office
anytime after Monday lunchtime (when the
cheque is signed!).
Congratulations to him and everyone who
solved what was quite a difficult puzzle for the
second week running. Come to think of it, this
week's isn't exactly trivial either, although it
isn't as hard as it first appears.
