Great annoyance i f o f t e n o c c a s i o n e d by the o l d boy who w i l l
say " I remember when t h i s was Green f i e l d s — " , but i t seems we
have few i n our m i d s t who have the m e n t a l span t o bore us w i t h
t a l e s of h o l l y hock where now s e a t s are warmed at the window
r a d i a t o r . However, by much p a t i e n c e , p e r s e v e r a n c e and l o n g s e r v i c e ,
the t a l e of The B a r , of the U n i o n b u i l t around i t and the H i s t o r y
connected w i t h i t have enabled t h i s w r i t e r t o say: " I have met
people who remember when "
Queenie's f a t h e r , Jim Peacock, was the f i r s t barman, s t a n d i n g
i n a s t a l l o u t s i d e the present Union b u i l d i n g - w i t h g r a s s and no
b u i l d i n g s i n f r o n t of him - s e l l i n g sandwiches, r o l l s and b o t t l e d
b e e r . T h i s was the f i r s t C o l l e g e Bar i n the C o u n t r y , and i n a few
y e a r s i t s p l a c e i n h i s t o r y was a s s u r e d by the f o r m a t i o n of 4 olubs
c l o s e l y connected w i t h i t and by i t s f i r m i n s t a l l a t i o n n e x t the
l a v a t o r y . The 21, 22, Chaos & L i n k s Clubs made the Bar a congenial-
meeting p l a c e , a good t a l k i n g - s h o p , a p l a c e f o r w a r r i o r s t o r e t u r n
to t e l l the t a l e and l i c k the odd wound (from r a g or honest game),
and of course a p l a c e i n w h i c h t o l i b e r a t e g r e a t exuberance - f o r
such i s the joyous outcome of b i b u l a t i o n .
Such i t was made, and such i t r e m a i n s . Ted Smith, j o i n i n g
Jim Peacock i n 1927 ( j u s t a f t e r I was b o r n ) , soon became steeped i n
the great t r a d i t i o n s of the p l a c e . He t e l l s w i t h obvious joy of
the days when women were not a l l o w e d i n the Union p r e c i n c t s except
