FILMSQC
Cry Filmsoc
Filmsoc's offering this Thursday is
Cn/ Freedom, A t t e n b o r o u g h ' s
directorial triumph set i n South
Africa.
Donald Woods (Kevin Kline),
investigates a newspaper article
critical of Steve Biko (Densel
Washington) and is w o n over by
Biko's charisma a n d conviction.
After Biko's brutal murder at the
hands of the South African police,
Wood refuses to believe the official
explanation for his death and calls
for a public enquiry. Persecution
and harrassment ensues.
Excellent direction a n d acting
performances here along with some
of the most amazing crowd scenes
ever filmed. This is political cinema
at its best. Not to be missed. See
What's O n page for details.

FOOTBALL
Death or Glory
Birmingham University—2
IC lsts—1
IC came heartbreakingly cjose to
pulling off a major upset in their first
ever appearance in the last 16 of the
national championships. Leading
1-0 with only 8 minutes remaining
IC conceded the inevitable equaliser
that took the game to extra time
where a goal-mouth scramble
brought Birmingham the winner.
The pattern of play w a s
established straight from the kick-
off as Birmingham surged forward
to w i n a rather dubious penalty
decision only to blast the resulting
spot-kick against the bar—with less
than thirty seconds having been
played!
This signalled the beginning of a
virtual siege of the IC penalty area,
which only some stout defending
and inspirational goalkeeping
prevented from bearing fruit.
Special mention must be made of
Ivan Parkin who played superbly at
left-back after being drafted in at the
last minute.
It was not all one-way traffic,
though, and on a rare foray forward
Pip Peel wiggled through a packed
defence and turned beautifully to
drill the ball home and stun the
midlanders.
As half-time approached, I C
suffered a cruel blow with the loss
of key midfield man Paul Olden
after a clash of heads left h i m
needing six stitches. The second half
saw B i r m i n g h a m attacking
unrelentlessly but IC's composure
at the back was admirable. The
crucial point of the match came
fifteen minutes from the end when
IC skipper Nigel Collier was clearly
pulled down inside the area having
broken through. The referee bottled
the decision and gave a free-kick on
the edge of the box rather than a
penalty which would have surely
won IC the match. The chance went
begging and in the end the valiant
Blues couldn't quite hang on 'till the
death.
HOCKEY
100 per cent
IC II—5
Royal Free II—0
For the first time i n Imperial's
history, the Hockey Club is fielding
two ladies' teams, and the seconds
justified their existence in this, their
first w i n this term.
In the first half, centre forward
Paula Grimshaw broke through the
Royal Free defence to score on 2
occasions, once receiving a superb
cross from newcomer Jackie Scott
and the other an individual effort.
The second half saw Jackie herself
scoring off a long corner taken by
the versatile right winger Alison
Franklin. Paula completed her hat-
trick defeating the demoralised
Royal Free backs, a n d finally
K a t h r y n Measures sealed the
opposition's fate.
The final result reflected the 100%
effort from the whole team and it
looks good for the future of IC's
newest team.
