March success
The anti-loans demonstration took
place peacefully and successfully on
Wednesday despite large setbacks
including the withdrawal of support
by the National Union of Students
and subsequently by the University
of London Union (ULU) Executive
Committee. The police estimated
that between t w o a n d three
thousand students participated i n
the march between Finsbury Circus
and Shorditch Park. Despite fears
about rioting a n d violence, no
arrests were made.
Fred Jarvis of the National Union
of Teachers, expressed h i s
sympathy and stressed that a great
sense of brothership was needed
between students of all disciplines
in order to present a 'united front'
against loans.
L o u i s a W o o d s , 15 year-old
Chairperson of the Hackney South
Labour Party Young Socialists,
claimed that the implementation of
loans would take the right to
education away from the poor. 'We
will not give u p , ' she said, 'we'll
fight 'till we w i n . '
Keith Budden U L U International
Officer, whose name was on the
public order bill for the march, was
proud of the success of the demo,
but disappointed that the route was
so 'ineffective'. He stressed that the
route was imposed by the police and
was the only option available.
Simon Aldis, Co-President of the
School of Oriental and African
Studies (SOAS), and senator to
U L U , told FELIX that he felt the
demo would have far more success
in the fight against loans than the
N U S march on November 24 1988.
In response to IC Union's lack of
support for the demonstration he
described the U n i o n as
'shortsighted', and said it showed
that the sabbaticals do not take their
position seriously'.
If they have no confidence i n
sabbaticals of other unions to
organise the march of their o w n
backs, they obviously don't feel
confident enough to take such
action themselves', he remarked.
He felt that the banning of
publicity about the action was the
main factor leading to the poor
turnout from Imperial, and said it
reflected very badly o n IC Union
Officers. 'They have no right to
represent students and ought to
resign', he said.
IC Union President Nigel Baker
told FELIX he still stood by his
original decision not to support the
march but added that if he had been
able to forsee the eventual success
he may have reacted differently.
Sagging ceiling
A room in Garden Hall was left with
a sagging ceiling last Friday when
an upstairs bathroom flooded. The
occupant has been told there is no
room elsewhere i n the Hall while
the ceiling is repaired.
Loretto O'Callaghan, the College
Accommodation Officer, said that if
the c e i l i n g w a s considered
dangerous b y the M a n a g i n g
Surveyor of Residences, M r Peter
H a l l w o r t h , then the student
involved would be given urgent'
priority on the waiting list in other
halls.
M r Hallworth said that he does
not consider this event particularly
dangerous and commented that 'If
the student wishes to move there is
nothing stopping h i m ' .
Mr Hallworth went on to say that
the recent collapses have been due
to water seepage, usually through
the negligence of students. H e
added that the onus is on students
to report any defect in their ceilings.
ICU to hold DES vigil

National Union of Students (NUS),
IC Union will be holding a vigil

Education of Science (DES) o n

Union President, Nigel Baker told

coffin at the vigil, bearing a copy of
the cover of the Government's
White Paper on student loans and
the w o r d s ' R . I . P . H i g h e r
Education.'
The vigil will be held on a rota
system with 5 people present
throughout the day. A n y b o d y
interested i n attending the vigil

installed at the entrance to the

guards with a view over Beit
Quadrangle.

Reeves, told FELIX that the new
lodge willl be i n addition to the
present porter's lodge under Beit
Arch, which will be altered to
p r o v i d e messengers w i t h a
