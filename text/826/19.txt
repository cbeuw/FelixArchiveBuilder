Union
Women's
Affairs
I thought it was about time I wrote
a few words again. Firstly some
reminders:
1. Rape alarms are still available
from the Union Office free of
charge.
2. I am still willing to arrange a
self-defence course but as yet I have
only had three takers. If there is
anyone else interested, please let me
know via the Union or Mech Eng
pigeonholes.
3. If there is anyone who would
like to visit their old school to talk
about science and engineering, and
Imperial in particular, please let
either Sandra D a w s o n
(Management School) or myself
know as soon as possible.
If there is anything else you would
like to talk to me about, I will be
available on Tuesday Feb 7, from
l p m to 3 p m i n the G r e e n
Committee Room (top floor, Union
Building). Free refreshments will be
available. I'd be very interested to
know what you think I should be
doing so I hope to see you there.
GUI Knowles, ICU Women's Officer
Party
Tonight, Friday February 3, IC Ents
are putting on the Virginia Vagabonds
in the Union Lounge. For those of
you who went to the Silwood
Bonfire Party, they were the first
band who played that evening.
Anyone who saw them, will tell
you how brilliant they were, playing
their own unique style of foot-
stomping country a n d western
music.
Not only this, but there's a disco
(and perhaps more importantly) a
bar extension until 12. Tickets for
the event are a mere £1 on the door,
and it starts at 9pm.
Loans Wrestling
1. Wrestling—This was a brilliant
laugh but not very well attended.
Thanks to all those who helped and
especially to Links Club for making
the evening.
2. Loans—the University of London
has submitted a paper to the DES.
The Governing Body working party
has still not met although I get the
i m p r e s s i o n that the above
mentioned paper is supposed to be
a substitute.
I am sending m y paper o n
London finance to all M P s and the
quality papers.
