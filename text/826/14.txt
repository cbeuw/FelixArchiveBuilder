The war of the roses
The O l d Vic—until March 11
The English Shakespeare Company,
under the artistic directorship of
Michael Bogdanov a n d Michael
Pennington present seven plays in
Shakespeare's history cycle over the
next six w e e k s . W e w i l l be
reviewing each of the plays in the
ambitious theatrical undertaking
over the next three weeks beginning
today with Richard II and Henry IV
pth
Richard II
In all too many of Shakespeare's
plays, the speed of narration leaves
one weary and encumbered by the
plot. But not so in this case. Swift
and sure direction has made this
play what all good plays should
be—a story told with eloquence and
the actor's art.
Michael Pennington plays King
Richard II, a wiley monarch deep set
in corruption and revelling in self-
importance and power. He expels
Henry Bolingbroke, son of John of
Gaunt, from the country and on the
death of G a u n t , siezes
Bolingbroke's rightful inheritance to
pay for Irish wars. While Richard is
in Ireland, Bolingbroke returns to
England a n d raises the country
against the K i n g . Richard returns
from his campaigns to find his
authority swept aside. Reluctantly
he surrenders h i s c r o w n to
Bolingbroke who becomes Henry
IV, and Richard is imprisoned and
killed in Pomfret Castle.
Pennington portrays a Richard
who exhibits a churlish arrogance
befitting a spoilt child. When i n
power he is the ultimate authority,
and although seemingly in control
there is always an unstable facet to
his character. H i s smile is an
insiduous grin and his eyes shifty,
"but his head is aloft. Yet his pride
disappears in the face of defeat, to
such an extent that he seems
querulous.
This characterisation contrasts
well with the more d o w n to earth,
solid presence of Bolingbroke,
played by Michael Cronin. H e
shows little of his human traits apart
from pride a n d w o r k m a n l i k e
determination.
Bridging the gap between the two
lead characters lies the forlorn
reasoning and wisdom of the Duke
of York (Colin Farrell), uncle to both
Richard and Henry, who has to
weigh up good and bad in the face
of conflict.
There is a p r e d o m i n a n t l y
Victorian flavour to the sets and
clothing. At the beginning of the
play we see Richard's court adorned
with a mish-mash of clothing styles
and colours. Once Bolingbroke takes
if
fH
over, the costumes become uniform
grey; very little colour b u t
immaculately orderly, w h i c h
cleverly emphasises the relative
styles of leadership.
I think that the 19th Century
setting lessened the impact of the
play, by removing much of the
coarseness of the medieval period.
It is a common ploy these days for
productions to set Shakespeare's
plays i n different times, to
emphasise the timeless quality of
the work. This production may not
have got the mood quite right, but
it was an interesting experiment all
the same.

Charlie Babbitt is a smooth talking
car dealer interested i n Buick's,
Lamborghini's a n d himself. H i s
father dies leaving three million
dollars to R a y m o n d Babbitt , a

R a y m o n d is an autistic savant

moments of genius. Charlie is
u n d e r s t a n d a b l y u p s e t — n o t
because of the state of his brother,
but because he received no cash.
' H e ' s inherited three million
d o l l a r s , a n d h e d o e s n ' t
u n d e r s t a n d t h e c o n c e p t of
money? It's poetic, isn't it?'—he
exclaims.
H e decides to k i d n a p h i s
brother and together they journey
across A m e r i c a . Slowly Charlie
discovers more about his past, his
father and that there's more to life
than looking after number one.
T o m Cruise, fresh from smiling
his w a y through Cocktail, plays
Charlie Babbitt, a n d shows not
only that he can act, but that he
is very good at it. But the show
belongs to D u s t i n H o f f m a n w h o

genius could p u l l off. Indeed,
H o f f m a n is so comfortable a n d
natural that h e detracts t h e
attention away from himself a n d
lets us focus o n T o m Cruise's

make this film one to look out for
at Oscar time.
