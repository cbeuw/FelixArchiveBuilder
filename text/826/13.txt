With its three main bars, the
Union, Southside and the Holland
Club along with a number of hall
bars, Imperial College has a massive
turnover of beer. It is the largest
outlet in the South East of England
and as a combined purchasing unit
it not only qualifies for extremely
large discount rates but has massive
bargaining power with which to
secure even greater discounts. Its
discount rates are at least equal
those of the whole of the N U S and
it is rumoured to have secured a
higher discount that can not be
disclosed for political reasons.
Yet prices in the Union Bar and
Southside have passed the £1 figure
whilst undergoing a 22% price rise
over last Summer. Over the last five
years prices have only increased by
about 20%. The Holland Club, a
members o n l y club f o r n o n -
academic College employees and
postgraduates, is approximately
17% cheaper than the other Bars. It
is better presented than the other
bars but is only open to members;
it is totally unreasonable that poor
undergraduate students should
have to pay considerably more than
paid members of staff.
The reasoning behind this is
supposed to be due to costs of
refurbishments, but this is not
altogether true. Southside is the
most expensive bar in College but
has not been refurbished for six
years. The Holland Club is the
cheapest bar a n d is being
continually upgraded. The U n i o n
Bar has recently been referbished
and the cost of this refurbishment
is due to be covered in two years at
pre-refurb turnover rates. This is
ludicrous as it necessitates a
dramatic increase in prices. The aim
of the refurbishment was to make
the facilities more attractive to the
students and hence increase trade,
increasing prices by 22% does not
help that objective.
Even though the Union has fouled
up on its refurbishment, it is saintly
in comparison to the College in its
running of their bar, Southside. In
1986, the only year we have reliable
figures for, Southside opperated at
a gross trading profit of 36% when
they were aiming at 40%. This
means that due to bad trading
practice, not low prices, 4% of the
£600K turnover was lost. W h e n the
Union discovered that they were
only achieving 38% gross profit last
year they suspended all the casual
staff a n d reorganised the
management structure. This drastic
measure not only resulted i n the
Union reaching its projected profit
level but also succeeded in shocking
Southside so much that, according
to their published accounts, their
profits rose for a short period to a
level higher than their prices
suggested they could ever achieve.
The trading figures with which the
committees are ment to make
management decisions took over six
months to arrive and over the next
six months three different figures
were produced for the same trading
period. Nobody really knows what
is going on! The latest accounts
show Southside to be operating at
57.5% gross profit; they project a
turnover of £660K. Southside
made a £20K net profit i n 1986
despite operating at 36% gross
profit; this translates into a 5% net
profit. This year it appears that
Southside are aiming at 26.5% net
profit. Financially this means that
College are aiming to screw the
students for £175K in Southside this
year.
So w h y doesn't the U n i o n
undercut Southside's prices? Firstly,
they have the wrong policy towards
recouping the costs of the refurb.
Secondly, College won't let them.
If the Union tried to undercut
Southside the College would cut
them out of the joint purchasing
deal. The result would be a small
reduction i n the discounts that
Southside secures and a massive
reduction in the Union's discount
The Union would lose income from
reducing prices and would lose
further by the loss of brewers
discounts. It simply can not afford
this.
The Union's only option if it is not
to deal with Southside and hope to
produce a free market is to join the
N U S and benefit from its discount
deals. This would cost around £30K
pa and would have massive political
repercussions. A far more sensible
move would be for the Union to
exert its right to Southside Bar as
laid down i n the by-laws, take it
over and run it for the students.
After all, we are one of the few
Unions who do not control all the
campus student bars. In 1986 the
Union encouraged the students to
boycott the bars and the outstanding
success resulted in the Union taking
over the Union Bar. The strangle
hold that Southside has over the
Union leaves us no choice but to
take Southside the same way.
The Union Refurbishment.
The refurbishment that took place
in the Union this Summer was
conceived in its eariest stages by the
R S M U Exec with the objective of
turning the Snack Bar into a more
sociable place to have a drink in the
evening whilst traditionalising the
Union Bar. The aim was to attract
more students to the Unions outlets
and it w a s these aims that
persuaded the Bar Committee and
last years Exec to head along the
costly road towards refurbishment.
Under recommendation from the
newly appointed Union Manager a
consultant was brought i n to
address the problem of producing
a flexible trading outlet that could be
used by the Snack Bar and Bar at the
same time. The consultant listened
to the ideas of a number of people
in the Union and spat them out in
a form that was totally unstudent-
proof and very expensive.
A second set of plans were drawn
up by a student Officer (Syd - Ed);
these encompassed the general
opinions of many students and staff
of the Union including a dais,
partition, dropped ceiling and fixed
seating. These plans were generally
considered to be superior to those
of the commercial consultant. The
same student drew up plans for the
Ents Lounge on similar advice and
the Ents Lounge plans were agreed
and instigated b y the H o u s e
committee.
At this point the sabbatical year
ended and this year's sabbaticals
took charge. In an effort to impress
the n e w intake w i t h atotally
refurbished ground floor, three
inexperienced and enthus-iastic new
sabbaticals and one enthusiastic and
inexperienced new Union Manager
threw out the student plans and
negotiated a new deal with the
original consultants. The deal cost
about £30K and coverted a long, tall,
straight, bright, pink and grey
Snack Bar with comfy fixed seating
into a long, tall, straight, bright, red
and blue Snack Bar without fixed
seating. At the same time, at almost
twice the original verbal quotes, the
Ents Lounge refurb was carried out
t h r o u g h t h e u s e of different
contractors.
The newly refurbished Snack Bar
does not have a cosier atmosphere
to encourage students to stay for a
drink. It does have a dropped ceiling
that cost £5k but it was only
dropped 1' 8 " instead of the 4'
suggested. There is no dias, as
proposed by the Bar Manager. The
movable partition that was provided
was not only unsuitable as a
partition but has already fallen
apart. A s for the Union Bar, the new
furniture moults pieces of wood of
leg size dimensions, not seasonally
but every day. The objectives of the
refurb have been missed altogether
and the U n i o n is £30K worse off.
The sad facts are that the trade
turnover in the Snack Bar and Bar
have not increased and if anything
the number of people using the
Snack Bar has fallen. Part of the
reason for this was doubtlessly due
to the astronomical prices proposed
and instigated at the beginning of
term by yet another consultant. The
Snack Bar food now has nothing like
the heavy veggie bias that existed at
the beginning of this year and the
prices are extremely reasonable, but
the damage has been done. The
main reason must be that the new
image of the Snack Bar is no better
than the old. The Bar not only has
no comfy seating but has 22%
higher prices: not a very good
incentive to travel from Princes or
Evelyn Gardens for a beer. To all
intents and purposes the Snack Bar
has become an evening pool hall
and very little else. The only saving
grace seems to be the increase i n
entertainments laid on by the H o n
Sec (Events).
The refurb in the Ents Lounge, on
the other hand, has not fallen apart;
it has proved extremely successful
and as a student venue is now
claimed to be one of the best i n the
South of England. G o o d praise
indeed coming from the bands that
play there.
College will claim that the Holland
Club is cheaper than the Union Bar
because it made a £4K net trading
loss last year. This is only 1.6% of
the total turnover of the Club and
could be compensated for by an
equivalent increase in prices. This
does n o t account f o r a 1 7 %
differential. A balance must be
restored to the system or the P G
membership of the Holland Club
will have to terminated.
