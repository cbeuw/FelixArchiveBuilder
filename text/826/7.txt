Cycle Britain
What makes someone want to cycle
1000 miles around Britain in 9V2
days? The answers could be many
but in my case it was to raise money
for the Christian Charity Tearfund
who fund long term development
projects in developing countries.
Equipment
Of paramount importance to such
a feat is a good reliable m a c h i n e -
mine is a Peugeot Ranger 10 gear
Mountain Bike—punctureless and in
good working order, having done
3000 miles i n 7 months. Only an
idiot would not train in advance of
such a feat. However flash training
schedules are not required. The best
training is cycling itself. I did several
runs from London to Kent and back
(60 miles each way) some hill work
and some sprint work buildling up
the stamina and the appropriate
muscles. However,as I was to
discover, more important than
t r a i n i n g is sheer guts a n d
determination. To make life as easy
as possible it is advisable to carry the
bare m i n i m u m amount of luggage.
Personally I prefer a rucksack to
panniers and carried less than 151bs.
Essential is a good full first aid kit
and the odd Mars Bar as iron
rations. Otherwise just a few tee-
shirts, a jumper, socks, lock for the
bike, tool kit for the bike and wooly
hat, gloves, a few polythene bags
and a m o n s o o n - p r o o f set of
waterproofs.
The Journey
So I set out on Friday July 22 at
1.30pm from Wye i n Kent and
started o n the most physically
challenging experience of my life.
This was an easy afternoon, a quick
65 miles to Barnes through pleasant
countryside w i t h no technical
p r o b l e m s b a r p a i n f r o m t h e
rucksack. This was soon remedied
on reaching Barnes.
Leaving Barnes at 7.45am o n a
dismal Saturday morning my next
stop was Newport in Cheshire—170
miles. The trip to Aylesbury was
slow. However the 40 miles from
Aylesbury to Banbury whistled by;
I had made 85 miles by lunch thus
reaching the beautiful market town
of Banbury which to my surprise
has the best jam doughnuts in the
c o u n t r y .
Thus replenished 1 continued up
the A41 through Warwickshire to
B i r m i n g h a m . T o m y m i n d
Birmingham is a horrible soulless
place, the least pleasant place 1
visited on the entire journey (sorry
brummies). Needless to say I sped
through Birmingham as fast as
possible—especially Handsworth—
on through Wolverhampton to
make Newport by 10pm. Despite
roughing it on the verge of the A41
I had a good night's sleep.
With no tent one may wonder
how I roughed it. Simple—I wore all
the clothes I had; my waterproofs,
wooly hat, scarve and gloves and
plastic bags on my feet (I cycled in
sandals, personally finding them
more comfortable than anything
else!). M y pillow was the rucksack.
Up at 5am o n Sunday to hit
Lancaster (120 miles). A t this point
I had no iron rations and I therefore
had to cycle for 4 hours until I got
any breakfast at the first shop I
found open. A t this stage m y
backside started to feel painful, a
recurring problem from this point
on. This proved to be an uneventful
day of reasonable progress reaching
Lancaster and a friend's house by
m i d - a f t e r n o o n .
Thus repleted I headed off rather
late the next morning (9am) to hit
Scotland. The A 6 and skirting the
lakes were no problem as there was
good weather on the pass and a
spectacular view. Lunch was in
Penrith which was the most scenic
town I passed through. The ride
to Carlisle was easy but on passing
over the River Esk and onto Gretna
G r e e n I h i t 40 m i l e - a n - h o u r
crosswinds and was forced to walk
along the A74 for 3 miles. That night
was to prove to be the worst of all.
I spent it just outside Beatock. It was
a blustery wet cold night in which
I initially slept in the churchyard
where, on feeling unsafe, I slept just
off the A74—I got two hours sleep.
O n Tuesday I was intending to
travel via Glasgow to Edinburgh but
due to my lack of sleep and the poor
weather I took the direct route to
Edinburgh via Biggar. I left Beatock
at 4.30am and nit Edinburgh at
10am. Here I did some sightseeing
for a few hours then crashed for the
rest of the day in a friend's flat.
Wednesday I decided to make up
a bit of mileage and cycled 50 miles
a r o u n d E d i n b u r g h a n d the
surrounding districts. That evening
Co-ordination is important
I was taken to the Lorre Mans,
undoubtedly one of the best pubs in
town with sheet music covering the
walls the whole place having the
appearance of an Aladin's cave and
whisky being £1 a shot (
V
4 gill!).
I had now completed 550 miles,
nothing was going to stop m e
now—or so I thought.
So on Thursday I headed South
through the Borders to Newcastle.
The Border's were heavy with
drizzle—my average progress was
down to 7 miles an hour with heavy
reliance on the low gears. The only
main town you pass through is
Jedburgh—built like a fortress. A t
7pm 30 miles from Newcastle—my
next intended stop—my gear cable
snapped, there was no way I could
make it to Newcastle so I walked
back 2 miles to the village of
Otterburn a f e w miles inside
England. Here there were 3 hotels
and by Sod's law all were full bar
the most expensive. However I was
soaked and spending a night out in
the continually bad weather was a
guaranteed method of obtaining
hypothermia. However, North-
erners being a friendly breed—an
evening in the bar was pleasant and
a hot bath and warm bed and
cooked breakfast a good start for the
next day.
Friday saw me hobbling 30 miles
to Newcastle i n 5th gear where the
bike was repaired and serviced for
a mere £2. After lunch I bombed it
down the A19 and A64 to York
stopping i n Thirsk for Fish and
Chips—the best i n the country
(those i n Edinburgh were foul).
York proved to be a problem i n
itself. I wanted to crash out in a held
south of York but d i d not realise I
could go via the unlabelled by-pass.
The centre of York has no traffic
signs at all—I spent half an hour
trying to find my way out of the
place—it seemed to have an active
nightlife though.
A few hours kip i n a field and I
sped it down through mundane
countryside to Grantham. Sped is
an exaggeration—my progress was
severely hampered by bad back and
bum pain that had to be suppressed
by p a i n k i l l e r s , o n l y grit
determination keeping me going. At
Grantham 1 caught a train to Kings
Cross a n d then cycled to
Wimbledom and another bed for the
night. I knew that on my last day
