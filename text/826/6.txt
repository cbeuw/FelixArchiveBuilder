Felix
Subterranean peddle-
cycle blues
You see us every day, weaving back
and forth through the traffic on
Cromwell Road: luminous yellow
jackets flashing in the early morning
sun. We are the people who eschew
the daily game of sardines on the
tube. W e are the ozone-friendly
commuters. W e are the London
Cyclists!
Yea! Hallelujah! Brothers and
Sisters of the saddle, the wheeled
shall inherit the Earth. But 1 am here
to talk about the devil: the devil we
all know, the London driver.
Toning d o w n the evangelicals,
what is it about the typical London
driver that makes him want to kill
the two wheeled road user? You can
see it in his face. His eyes mist over
as he lines the furry dice up on your
rear m u d g u a r d . T h e foot
unconsciously reaches for the
accelerator. The engine revs. A
mind with but a single thought: to
reduce Joe Cyclist to an ingenious
new road marking. 'Red Stain'; it
means Cyclists Beware.
No drivers seem to be immune.
There is the 'Lombard' the man who
part-exchanged his brain to buy a
GTi. He sits there i n the driver's
seat, one hand on the car phone, the
other on his secretary's knee and he
will race anything that moves. A n
unwary cyclist scuttles past h i m in
the queue for the traffic lights. The
lights change. Five yards beyond
them, our two-wheeled hero, feels
a rush of air. Behind him there is the
sound of a hi-fidelity, graphic
equalised car horn.
A n experienced cyclist would
know what to do: pull over as fast
as possible and watch as a smirk on
an inplausible salary thunders past.
But our hero is new to London, he
holds his ground. There is another
blast o n the horn a n d several
thousand pounds of Vorsprung
Durch Technick flys past millimetres
from the handlebars. A lot of
'Lombards' o w n blood-red cars; that
way mistakes don't show.
Then there's the 'Rep'—People to
see, deals to do, money to make and
never enough time. He considers
himself to be a professional London
driver. ' M e , have an accident?
Never! Reactions far to fast for
that— F * * * , those lights changed
quick'. H e slams on the brakes and
old t w o - w h e e l s b e h i n d h i m
becomes a permanent feature of the
rear bumper.
But these are but foot soldiers i n
the Great War. Most Lombard's
were extinguished i n the Stock
Market crash a n d Reps don't
venture into the darker back streets,
at least not during office hours.
They are minor players compared
with the Black King of the motorists,
the London Cabbie.
Cabbies have the honour of
sharing the few so-called cycle lanes
with their rightful owners. Only
they don't seem to see it like that.
To them, the pedal-powered are as
good as invisible. Your typical
London Cabbie suffers from chronic
bicycle blindness. All the cyclist ever
sees of a cab is a cigarette ad
rocketing past without so much as
by-your-leave.
But the cabbie has more subtle
weapons too. Picture this: the cyclist
waiting at traffic lights, the cabbie
behind him. Again the lights change
to amber. These are London traffic
lights, green is go, amber is go, red
is go if there's nobody watching.
The cabbie thinks the cyclist should
be moving. The cyclist starts to
pedal, but apparently not fast
enough. The cabbie stays on his tail,
he doesn't overtake, he doesn't
even try to overtake, he just hovers
there. The cab speed up. The bicycle
has to match him. The cab speeds
up more. The cyclist pedals faster
and faster—no time to change gear.
All effort going into staying ahead.
No attention is given to steering or
braking. A bicycle out of control
thundering along the road. A t the
very last minute the cab overtakes
leaving the cyclist, legs aching and
eyes watering to totter on. A small
battle, no fatalities but the driver's
undoubtedly the victor.
I say no fatalities, but there do
seem to be more bright red cabs on
the roads. Perhaps Lombard's
found himself another job...
S o m e t h i n g M U S T be done!
Cyclists of the world unite, you have
nothing to lose but your chains. We
. must all pedal together. I have a
dream, a dream that one day cyclists
and drivers will live together i n
harmony. That drivers will leave a
three-foot gap when overtaking.
That the council will repair all the
pot holes in the Kensington roads.
That cycle lanes will be found
throughout the land and Cabbies
will wait at traffic lights. This is my
dream and it is a dream in which all
must believe, cyclists and drivers
alike.
A n d if the drivers cast aside these
words of wisdom, we must wait.
Wait until the petrol runs out and
everyone has to drive Sinclair C5s.
A n d the vengeance will be ours!!!!
THE BARON
OF CHEAPSKATE
Derek Dash was laughing. He knew
it made him look senile but he
couldn't help it. This was the best!
The Chief Citizen had made such a
fool of himself, he was even beating
Mad Dash, this time.
Little Lord Patacake, the Chief
Citizen, had dreamt up a Working
Party to entertain all of the citizens.
After divine inspiration, he had
called it S M U D G E . Few people
knew what S M U D G E stood for and
still fewer cared, but it seemed
impressive.
To celebrate the Working Party,
the citizens had held a citizens'
meeting, where everybody jumped
up and d o w n and shouted a lot. A t
the end they had torn up lots of bits
of paper, scribbled o n them and
thrown them in a box.
Little Lord Patacake had hoped
the citizens would like the Working
Party and he had asked his good
friend, Phil Doodle to bring all his
friends along. Phil Doodle was the
Chief Citizen of all the Doctors and
Nurses and was very popular with
them. If he said 'Scribble on lots of
bits of paper,' they would.
Little Lord Patacake's Working
Party was such fun! Lots of people
liked it and lots of people didn't.
Some people felt so strongly about
it that thev scribbled on sheet upon
sheet of paper i n a frenzy.
Everybody felt that they were
making a big decision as they
frantically scribbled upon their bits
of paper.
S h o u l d they have another
Working Party and have lots more
big meetings or should they let little
Lord Patacake and his chums spend
all their monev without telling
them?
When everybody felt they had
scribbled on enough pieces of paper,
some of the citizens who could
count rummaged through the big
box full of paper. They decided that
the Working Party had been ruined
and Little Lord Patacake would have
to think again.
Now it was time for Svdney
Sillvname to say the things that had
to be said. Sydney had said so much
recently that he had thought about
changing his name again. The best
suggestion so far was Noggin the
Nog (name changed in aid of greater
clarity).
A l l around Cheapskate the
citizens were talking about who
would be Chief Citizen next year.
Kneel McSlimesky had already told
everybody he was going to be Chief
Citizen but there were other moves
afoot.
Duncan Random had decided to
stand and even ex—clown Clare
MacUseless was talking about the
idea: Stephalump Snell was still
denying everything. The fact of the
matter was that things were not
going to change a great deal if any
of them got in.
Meanwhile, In the heights of the
Surefield Fortress, John Secretary
was thinking about his years at
Cheapskate. He hated the Baron
and his wife and he wanted out.
Now was as good a time as any, he
thought. This Summer, he would
leave, even if the Baron, Derek
Dash, was going to appoint a Yes—
Man in his place. He had so wanted
his friend from You-Loo to do the
job, b u t he c o u l d n ' t have
everything. John knew that when
he went, all of his friends would
follow.
Will Little Lord Patacake throw a
wobbly?
Is John Secretary really about to leave?
Will Rob McNorthy ever appear in the
Baron?
Will Duncan Random do anything
significant?
Find out in the next episode.
