THE r. *R OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
REPORT SETS 'TARGET DATE' 1993
RHBNC MERGER
A working party report published this week has suggested that Imperial
College and Royal Holloway and Bedford New College should merge to
form a College similar to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)
in America. The report recommends that a final decision be made by the
Summer of this year, with a 'target date' for a merger in 1993-4. It also
seeks the setting up of a Joint Planning Committee between the two
Colleges to explore the implications of the merger. The report
acknowledges that the financial difficulties of RHBNC and IC will not
be solved by a merger, and concludes that the 'longer term advantages'
of merging outweigh the short-term disadvantages.
The working party suggest that
first-year Science, Engineering and
Arts undergraduates and half of the
second year students should be
housed on the Egham site. They
anticipate that this arrangement will
prove attractive to students who will
initially be h o u s e d 'at a
comparatively sheltered and close
knit campus at Egham' before
moving to a 'more independent
existence in Central London'
The financial difficulties faced by
both IC and R H B N C will not be
solved by a merger and a merged
institution will need to make cuts in
order to break even according to the
report. Because a merger would not
change the financial situation of
either College, says the report, each
site would be responsible for settling
its own debt; Imperial College faces
a deficit of £4M and R H B N C a
deficit of £2.5M by 1992.
A merger between the two
institutions w o u l d allow new
accommodation and research units
to be built on the Egham site, says
the report. According to the Rector,
Professor Eric Ash, the College may
be able to take out loans for new
• accommodation and set rent levels
such that the College's deficit is not
increased. The Rector commented
that building in South Kensington
would not be possible because the
'We a r e m i l i t a n t '
rents involved would be 'out of this
world' but added that if building
were to take place on 'free land in
Egham' the arithmetic would 'look
quite good.
The report states that the merged
insitution will concentrate on
Science and Technology but
highlights the possibility of
incorporating arts into scientific
courses. The w o r k i n g party
compares Imperial College with the
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (MIT) and quotes an
internal report on undergraduate
engineering education at MIT which
states that 'it is essential that
engineering undergraduates receive
a broad f o u n d a t i o n in the
humanities, arts and social
sciences.'
The possibility of 'new areas of
research between the Arts and
Social Sciences and the Sciences and
Technology' and the possibility of
broadly based four-year degree
courses are also discussed in the
report.
The report does not mention the
effect of a merger on the Student
U n i o n s . The omission was
described by U n i o n D e p u t y
President, Chas Brereton, as
'disgraceful.' He stressed that the
effect on clubs and societies would
be highly detrimental and described
the whole concept of a merged
Union as 'a bloody nightmare.'
Union President, Nigel Baker, told
FELIX that the problems which have
arisen between St. Mary's Student
Union and IC Student Union are a
direct result of the lack of
consideration given to the Union in
the discussion of that merger. He
insists that at least one batical
officer from each of IC .1. 1BNC
Unions should be of the
new joint committee to be set up
and intends to discuss this proposal
with the Rector in the near future.

A controversial motion to abolish
Union General Meetings (UGMs)
was defeated by 150 votes at the
U n i o n G e n e r a l M e e t i n g o n
Tuesday. The meeting was attended
by over six hundred students,
including a delegation of over 200
from St Mary's Medical School in
what has been described as the most
crowded U G M since 1986. The
m o t i o n was met by strong
o p p o s t i o n f r o m a group of
concerned students and IC Union's
three media services who organised
a petition and a poster campaign i n
support of retaining U G M s .
The m o t i o n , tabled by an
unofficial Union working party
looking into the problems of
merging the Imperial and St Mary's
students' Unions, was brought to
the U G M after receiving approval
from Council last week. It was
designed to solve the problems
students from St Mary's would have
in attending U G M s on the Imperial
site, and presented a number of
recommendations on
accommodation, clubs amd U L U
representation.
The motion called for the abolition
of U G M s and the establishment of
Council as the supreme decision
making body of the Union. Under
the proposal, students would be
able to mandate Council to discuss
motions provided thev had 25
seconders, but they would not have
the right to vote and speaking rights
would be given at the discretion of
C o u n c i l . The motion allowed
Emergency General Meetings to be
* lied through a petition of 150
Union members and mandated
Union Officers to report to students
