Sunday I had to do 125 miles to
finish. Leaving at 8am I whipped
down the South Circular beating the
cars at the lights all the way and
d o w n the A 2 for North Kent.
Through Rochester and Chatham to
Canterbury for lunch was no sweat.
Sixty miles still to go, I left
Canterbury for Margate, still n o
problem. However, the last 30 miles
from Ramsgate to Wye were hell. I
just made it by 9pm. Sheer ecstasy
overcame me; 1002 miles done and
£250 for charity and myself having
completed a feat I never expected to
do.
Reflections
A t the speed I went, sightseeing
was not much of an option—to do
this one can only realistically expect
to do 50 miles a day—I averaged 120.
However to see most of the country
by bicycle i n 9 days is a unique
experience—the diversity of the
British countryside is amazing.
Without a doubt the Borders were
m y favourite part—beautiful
countryside close to Edinburgh and
Newcastle which are both great
cosmopolitan cities with plenty
happening.
Asked if 1 would do such a thing
again an emphatic unhesitant yes
is the answer—London is not a great
place for cycling and I miss the
peace a n d challenge of a long
distance ride t h r o u g h open
countryside. However, the crux of
the effort is psychological. Physical
stamina and guts are essential along
with knee support bandages, Ralgex
and painkillers but th? greatest
angish is on the mind. The distance
I covered is peanuts compared to
the kind of mileage a professional
racing cyclist does. However they
have good back-up teams and the
other racers to spur them on. O n my
challenge there was none of this,
only one's o w n determination to
keep going.
M y final sentence is to say I had
a great time doing it so w h y not try
it yourself?

Throughout my time at Imperial a
' t h e m a n d u s ' situation h a s
prevailed between the three
sabbaticals in the Union Office and
the fourth, responsible for the
production of FELIX. This probably
arose due to differences in opinion
which could not be resolved without
going into battle but it is the
propagation of this situation that is
of concern. FELIX takes a lot of time
to produce, particularly in collating
and I believe that the group of
people w h o are involved are
motivated, o n the whole, by
regarding themselves as constantly
defending themselves against
attempts to restrain editorial
freedom. Scandals become
watergates a n d reporters are
constantly fighting the repressive
power of the Union Office.
I apologise to the few people in
the FELIX Office who do work hard
to produce balanced reports based
on fact, but they themselves have
voiced their opinion that the Editor
has actively perverted the facts
presented to h i m to produce a
'juicier' FELIX.
The e n d result is that people
regard FELIX as a pedantic bickering
schoolkid and lose whatever interest
or positive ideas about what the
Union Office exists for, whilst
reading equally petty replies from its
Officers. The activities of the Union
Officers s u p p l y h o m e - g r o w n
material for FELIX, much easier to
come by than 'proper' news of
College and the outside world. In a
sense the U n i o n Officers are
accountable to FELIX and anyone
standing for a sabbatical post lives
in fear of a bad word from the
Editor. The anomaly lies in the fact
that the FELIX Editor is the only
officer who is not accountable to a
U G M . The student body can take
only one course of action against the
Editor and that is to no-confidence
him. H e cannot be censored or
mandated to print any particular
item.
At a recent Council meeting, the
time honoured question of Editorial
freedom arose and I was disturbed
to see people skirting around the
problem by resolving that the Exec
c o u l d p u b l i s h their news o n
departmental noticeboards and i n
C C U newspapers rather than by
mandating the FELIX Editor to print
up to one page of such news.
The present Editor accepted that
he would put in Exec news if we
provided h i m with pasted-up,
camera-ready page and provide
collators to insert this page. If
everyone who ever writes anything
for FELIX had to do this, the Editor
would have only the Print Unit to
manage, but no, other articles are
okay (with some exceptions). But in
this great world of democracy as
highly supported i n last week's
FELIX, the Editor does not feel that
an Exec News is important enough
to print without blackmailing us into
doing part of his job. If the Editor
wishes to stay up all night helping
me with Carnivals, discos, bar
quizes, etc, then I will surely stay up
all night to collate.
Speaking of democracy, FELIX
insisted (very strangely) that
students should have the right to
their say at a U G M . If U G M s are
therefore so righteous a n d
representative, why does the FELIX
Editor refuse to be mandated by
one? The other sabbaticals are
essentially the employees of the
student body, with a U G M as
Managing Director. The FELIX
Editor is paid i n exactly the same
way without having to care in any
way what a U G M tries to make h i m
do.
N o w , w h y does this attitude
prevail? It is because the idea of
editorial freedom must be passed
d o w n i n some sort of ritual,
chanting h a n d o v e r ceremony
during which the Editors eyes are
fitted with tunnels and he smears
his loyal helpers with the blood of
a virgin cat.
So what should be done? A t
present things aren't desperate.
There is a working relationship
between myself and the Editor,
although this might not prevail i n
future times. A major point is the
Exec News. It might be wise for the
FELIX Editor to agree to print up to
one page of Exec N e w s every
fortnight, this agreement to be
reviewed at Joint Council each year.
His failure to do this might lead to
a constitutional change to make the
Editor accountable to a U G M .
I apologise to those of the FELIX
staff that I do respect as doing a very
good job and I hope that the Editor
does not see this as a personal
attack. If there are any factual
inaccuracies, please don't write in,
it is the gist that I want to promote
not small details.
