Proposing the motion, Union
President Nigel Baker said that aside
from abolishing U G M s , there was
'no other way for the two Unions to
merge.' He added that the working
party h a d spent a long time
discussing the matter and pointed
out that the decision had 'not been
taken lightly'.
Speaking against the motion,
Union Life member Dave Parry said
the w o r k i n g ^ party h a d n o t
considered the ramifications of the
motion they were proposing and
that they had not consulted the rest
of the student body. He pointed out
that they h a d not consulted the
College o n proposed increases i n
Union representation o n College
Committees and added that the
College would be unlikely to accept
such changes.
'The Union is the collective voice
of students. Without Union officers
directly reporting to its members the
Union will become divorced from
the people it represents' he said.
The motion was taken to the vote
following a procedural motion by
Nick Jarman. A paper ballot was
called and the motion defeated with
214 students voting in favour and
364 against.
Commenting o n the ballot, St
Mary's Union President Phil Drew
said that he didn't feel the meeting
was w i l l i n g to listen to the
arguments i n an unbiased fashion
and q u e s t i o n e d w h e t h e r the
meeting w a s representative of
Imperial's 5000 students. He added
that U G M ' s would be unworkable
if Imperial College were to merge
with Royal Holloway and Bedford
New College.
'IC has to look forward and stop
sticking in the m u d , ' he said.
Speaking o n behalf of the pro-
U G M contingent, U n i o n
Postgraduate affairs officer, David
Clements said, 'the large St Mary's
contingent demonstrated that they
can get here for U G M s . It proves the
arguments of the working party are
wrong.'
Good Idea?
Any student with a new business
idea, a n e w product, or a n e w
approach to a business problem,
could w i n £20,000 and the backing
of the Royal Mail to its completion.

CIA ejected from college
Students from the Courtaulds
Institute of Art (CIA) were escorted
from College premises by College
Security o n Monday, after Union
President, Nigel Baker discovered
them publicising Wednesday's
march against Student Loans.
Mr Baker confiscated posters and
leaflets headed London Loans
Campaign from the CIA students as
well as material being distributed by
members of IC Socialist Worker
Student Society (SWSS).
Angus Batey, Loans and Poll Tax
Officer for C I A commented that if
the I C U Executive 'Decided to deny
students the right to freedom of
speech,' they were setting 'a very
dangerous precedent.' Speaking on
Mr Baker tearing leaflets from one
female C I A student he said that he
was 'angry and disturbed' by M r
Baker's behaviour.
M r Baker said that he was
'carrying out the decision of the
Executive,' w h i c h decided to
withdraw ICU support for the loans
march last week. He added that if
the Executive decision had not been
upheld by Tuesday's Union General
Meeting, the situation would have
been different.
Union faces the madding crowd
Through the motions
Imperial College Union is to decide
next year whether or not the Union
should reaffiliate with the National
Union of Students (NUS) following
an overwhelming vote in favour of
a referendum by Tuesday's Union
General Meeting ( U G M ) . The need
for a referendum was laid down by
the N U S as a condition for the
Union's collaboration with the N U S
on the student loans issue and was
put toward in one of three motions
proposed by Union President Nigel
Baker on the student loans issue.
The second motion put forward
by M r Baker called for I C U to
boycott Wednesday's march against
loans. M r Baker explained that the
National and London N U S and the
University of London Union (ULU)
had pulled out of the march for
safety reasons and suggested that
ICU should do the same.
S p e a k i n g i n o p p o s i t i o n , a
spokesman from the Socialist
Workers Society pointed out that
the stewards for the march had been
properly vetted and that there was
no danger of the march being
illegaly diverted to Westminster or
the Department of Education and
Science. H e added that it was
important to hold a demonstration
on 1st February, this being the last
day for submissions in response to
the Government's white paper on
Student loans.
IC Union delegate to U L U ' s
G e n e r a l U n i o n C o u n c i l , H a l
Calamvokis, pointed out that
vetting of stewards h a d been
dropped when U L U pulled out of
the march. The motion was taken to
the vote and passed after a short
speech by Julian Moore when he
suggested that I C U should not
support the march, and pointed out
that students would nevertheless be
free to attend.
Mr Baker's third motion, that the
Union boycott lectures on February
16 and attend alternative events in
the Union Building was passed
without opposition.
Radio
GaGa
Imperial College Radio may have to
stop sending its signal to Evelyn
Gardens unless more than £1,000
can be found for annual rental of the
British Telecom link. Because they
cannot transmit to Evelyn Gardens,
IC Radio use a cable system to a
number of houses. The cable was
installed i n 1981, but B.T. only
started billing IC Radio last June,
and did not reveal the price until
this week. Station Manager Nigel
Whitfield told FELIX T very much
regret that the line hasn't worked
well all the time; even so people do
listen to it, and it will be a shame if
the service has to stop because we
can't find the money.'
