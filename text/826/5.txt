A victory for common sense.
In recent history there have been
few Union General Meetings
(UGMs) as well attended as the
UGM on Tuesday. The issue at
stake, of course, was the abolition
of Union General Meetings. Over six
hundred students turned up and
despite the presence of 250
students from St Mary's Medical
School intent on removing UGMs,
the motion was defeated by 150
votes. It was indeed a victory for
common sense.
The unofficial working party
looking into the problems of merger
between St Mary's and IC Union
will now have to rethink the UGM
problem.
For those who are unaware of the
situation, the working party decided
that St Mary's would have difficulty
attending IC UGMs and concluded
that the best way to deal with this
problem was to abolish UGMs. No
UGM, no problem!
I hope that this time the working
party will learn from their mistakes
and bring a wider body of opinion
into their discussions. Otherwise,
as we have seen, a group of ten
people can become fixated with a
solution which, although ludicrous,
can seem to be the only solution.
Perhaps it is time for an official
working party to be set up. If this
party reported regularly back to
Council then so much the better; it
would allow ideas to be tossed
around and developed much more
thoroughly.
Looking at the people who sat on
the working party it is easy to see
why they favoured throwing out
UGMs. Of the ten members in the
group, eight were representing the
Constituent College Unions (CCUs)
and if UGMs were removed there
i would be an inevitable increase in
the importance and influence of
CCU UGMs and hence the CCUs
themselves.
The other two members of the
Committee were ICU President
Nigel Baker and Deputy President
Chas Brereton. I will hazard no
guesses here as to what their views
might be. Suffice it to say that in
conjunuction with the rest of
Council they would have gained
much more personal influence in
the Union if UGMs were abolished.
This aside, I hope that as a Union
we can reach an agreement which
will be both to the benefit of the
average student and to the two
unions.

Sad, but true; it's been another one
of those weeks. O u r Illustrious
Leaders i n the Union office have
reached the state where the very
mention of the words FELIX or
Union General Meeting reduces
them immediately to a catatonic
trance, and the good M r Goodwin
has succumbed to stress to such an
extent that he was actually rude - in
front of witnesses - to two people in
one day.
What was all this about? Well, in
retrospect, not a lot. The above
Illustrious Leaders set up a working
party, which decided that it didn't
think U G M s were a very good idea.
The Illustrious Leaders Council
decided it agreed with the working
party, and tried to put a motion to
a U G M , abolishing U G M s . N o t
surprisingly, the U G M disagreed
with this, and told the Illustrious
Leaders so by defeating the motion
in no uncertain terms. End of story.
If only! Walter is quite certain that
the story is only just beginning, and
that the next chapter will involve the
Illustrious Leaders in a concerted
attempt to curtail M r Goodwins
freedom to print what he likes. H e
will keep telling y o u what your
Union is u p to, and we can't have
that, can we?
Enough of this drivel. News now
of the strange collection of
equipment which turned u p o n
Prince Consort R o a d o n
Wednesday. Walter is i n a position
to dispel all vicious rumour: they
were in fact making a film about
Jerry Lewis, to be given the original
title of 'Great Balls of Fire'.
A n d n o w to a more important
matter. After all, it's very topical,
this business of Unions and films,
but y o u wouldn't want a whole
column full of it, would you? N o ,
this is really important. Walter is
delighted to report that he was i n
error i n assuming that all the
Antipodean types who have taken
over Gloucester R o a d are
Australians. Some of them are from
New Zealand, a fact your columnist
only discovered whilst ignoring his
doctors orders last night and getting
securely drunk with a few of them
in the wine bar of the Norfolk Hotel
(a nice little claret called Fosters Kiwi
Special). Anyone who has met Paul
Hogan will agree that anything -
absolutely anything - is preferable
to an Australian, and the names of
New Zealanders such as Ngaio
Marsh have been heard all over the
civilised world. A n d in America.
