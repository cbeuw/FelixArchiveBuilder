A Bill of Rights
The case for Britain having a Bill of
Rights grows more controversial,
particularly as the Government
embarks stubbornly o n the
implementation of tough anti-
terrorist a n d immigration laws.
Charter 88 is the latest 'basket of
proposals' i n urge of a written
constitution and an entrenched Bill
of Rights, and as the previous article
suggests, it has struck a chord in
widely diverse circles. What is,
naively, ignored by the agitators of
Charter 88 is the immense, if not
revolutionary, changes that would
have to be undergone in the British
Constitution to accommodate such
a document. A n d then, the question
must be asked, 'Will human rights
necessarily improve?'. The United
States has had an enshrined Bill of
Rights for almost two centuries—is
the situation better there?
Apparently not, if one were to judge
by recent 'Civil rights for blacks'
demonstrations.
A n enshrined Bill of Rights (such
as Charter 88) is consistent with the
logic of a written constitution; The
most obvious example is that of the
U S A where the written constitution
consists of a conservative rigid
f r a m e w o r k , whose authority
exceeds that of a n y elected
government. O n the other hand the
British constitution is largely
unwritten and based on a system of
flexible conventions.
What the enthusiasts of Charter 88
fail to anticipate is that in a written
constitution every piece of
legislation has to be laboriously
shaped to the given standard
structure. This then is one of the
major disadvantages of a written
c o n s t i t u t i o n . A permanently
installed document (such as Charter
88) would create a cumbersome
m o n o l i t h w h i c h c o u l d slow
government response to public
opinion, sometimes fatally. A classic
(if cruel) example is that the U S
(birth place of modern feminism)
should have no national equal
opportunities legislation; the equal
rights amendment (to provide
protection against sexual
discrimination) was formulated i n
the heat of the Women's Movement
in the 70s. But according to the US
constitution, any such amendment
must be ratified by a two-thirds
majority i n t h e Congress.
Consequently, the equal rights
a m e n d m e n t h a u l e d t h r o u g h
expensive a n d exhausting
campaigns in different states, finally
dying from lack of the necessary
number when its deadline for
ratification was reached.
O n the other hand, Great Britain
reacting to overwhelmingly social
pressure of the time, adopted a Sex
Discrimination Act almost within
the life time of a single Parliament.
At present, the essence of the
British Constitution lies i n its
Parliamentary sovereignty (that is,
no legal body can oppose any act
passed by the Parliament). In this
way, the separation between the
Judiciary a n d Parliament is
maintained. However, with the
introduction of a Bill of Rights, the
Judiciary would be invariably pulled
into the political arena (after all, to
w h i c h other body w o u l d the
supporters of Charter 88 entrust the
task of being above Parliament).
This could arguably give Judges,
and not Parliament, the ultimate
discretion i n setting political
limitations o n legal powers. In
particular, Charter 88 is based on a
broad set of principles, the
application of which would depend
on the 'personal opinion' of the
judge. One should remember that
the judges are unelected and hence
not answerable to the public, as
politicians are. In addition, the
'politicisation' of the 'unelected'
Judiciary would bring them into
direct conflict with the 'elected'
Parliament, a n y realist w o u l d
acknowledge the jealousy with
which M P s protect their sovereign
power. A t most, the threatened
Parliament could be led to reviewing
the Judiciary, thus restricting the
restricting power of justice, itself a
safeguard of freedom.
• A s Law Lord McCluskey argued
that final policy decisions should be
made by society as a whole through
an elected Parliament and not by
judges, no matter how 'upright' and
'distinguished' they may be.
Even if sufficient consensus to an
incorporation of Charter 88 could be
achieved, it is likely that the sharp
divisions and constant fluidity of
British politics will ensure perpetual
challenges to the Bill.
The Conservative Party see the
'right to own one's property' and
'the right to work' unhindered
(euphemism for anit-trade unions)
as basic human rights. O n the other
hand the Labour Party views the
G o v e r n m e n t ' s right to o w n
property a n d trade unions to
exercise total power as their version
of basic rights. Already there are
allegations by the opposition party
that the Judiciary is politically
biased. With a Bill of Rights and
subsequent potiticisation of the
Judiciary, there would be absolute
chaos i n party politics. So unless
party politics were to die, legislation
such as Charter 88 would be no
greater guarantee of liberty than
present.
Thus when the N e w Statesmen
Society (co-creators of Charter 88)
speak of creating popular politics
out of 'Bourgeois Revolution', they
presumably mean an injection of
French democratic concepts into the
traditional British political system.
But t h e British tradition of
democracy predates the French
Revolution and human rights can be
protected by legislation despite the
absence of a written constitution;
Magna Carta, Habeas Corpus and
the 1688 Constitutional Settlement
prove so. A n elected Government
is always answerable to the people.
Harsh oppressive laws can be
opposed by intense lobbying from
the public and then there is the
European Court of Justice, to which
the Government is ultimately
answerable to.
Indeed the agitator of Charter 88
have a point in that the Government
is now operating in a world with
little effective opposition, but a more
realistic approach is needed. The
desire to defeat an unbeatable
Government by erecting supra-
legislation is not a democratic
impulse, nor is it sound even i n
Charter 88's own terms.

Union Officers tend to get a little
terrified when faced with large
numbers of students. Sabbaticals
suddenly realise that these people
could fire them. Aspiring sabbaticals
are cautious because a false word
c o u l d force t h e m to become
accountants i m m e d i a t e l y , as
opposed to in a year's time. This is
how it was on Tuesday.
Was it a successful publicity
campaign? Was it whipping of the
Mary's block vote? Was it a sudden
and concerted abandoning of the
general apathy for Union affairs? For
whatever reason there were 600
people at the U G M , and the hacks
shrank into the background.
Occasionally the Exec were forced
to speak on an issue. Even then they
immediately headed for the middle
ground of conciliation. Nigel Baker
opposing A m i n El-Kholy's motion
to allow foreign language posters
was u n n a t u r a l l y polite. ' I ' m
opposing this motion but I don't
want to annoy any foreign students
if that's all right by y o u '
The stars of the meeting were the
complete randoms who stepped out
of obscurity to propose a procedural
motion that we go straight to a vote,
to then vanish into the crowd
without leaving a name for the
annals of time. Are you sure you
don't want to be External Affairs
Officer?
A n d finally, with the masses
itching to get back to lab, w e
reached the motion on the abolition
of U G M s . Nigel decided to waffle
interminably about the entire
history of I C U , Mary's and the
universe finishing with '..but if you
don't want to, then we'll have to go
back a n d think about i t . ' T h e
opposition, having decided not to
let Cosmic speak, brought out their
pet dinosaur (Dave Parry). Dave
told people that it wasn't right,
they'd never have done it in his day,
and people should have the right to
ask sabbaticals questions even if
they didn't want to answer them.
Another procedural motion to go
straight to a vote and we were
treated to a tall postgrad telling us
that we were all first and second
years so we should listen to what
older people with more experience
had to say before we voted. That
one was carried straight off.
After ten minutes of shambolic
mess the votes were taken on lots
of bits of pink paper. Everyone,
having voted to save democracy,
decided 'democracy can sod off
now, we're going to lab'. Despite
the astounding turnout from
Mary's, the astounding l i i ul
from IC won the day v 1
