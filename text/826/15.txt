Henry I V , Pt 1
Henry IV, who usurped Richard lis
crown, is n o w King. The Earl of
Northumberland, who helped him
to the crown, has turned against
him. The King's son Prince Hal,
spends his time in taverns with the
disreputable Falstaff. Hotspur,
Northumberland's son, raises a
rebellion against H e n r y I V ,
advancing the claim of Hotspur's
brother-in-law to the throne. H a l
Joins the King to fight the rebels and
kills Hotspur at the Battle of
Shrewsbury.
Michael Cronin returns as King
Henry. 1 was interested to see
whether he would expend on his
character in Richard II, which was
largely a black-and-white portrayal.
But here it is much the same. I was
surprised to learn that Henry IV was
not the central character, but
appears occasionally throughout the
play. So, Cronin continues to play
him as a tough, resolute King, but
with little emotional subtlety.
Most of the play concentrates on
the young Prince Hal's relationship
with his boozing, bungling eldery
companion Falstaff. In their scenes
together, the stage is full of people
and the scenery condensed to
suggest intimacy and fellowship
amongst the pubfolk, simpletons
and scoundrels that the wanton
Prince associates himself with.
Falstaff is a lovable old buffoon
played with zest a n d roguish
impudence by Barry Stanton. H i s
tall tales and witticisms allow the
play to move on confidently.
The whole of the first half of the
play takes on an air of frivolity, as
our senses are bombarded with an
anachronistic blend of characters
and costumes. We see Northern
vokels, London bobbies and even
punk scumballs. Richard II was set
in the 19th Century but here it
seems that any style of costume that
fits the mood of the character is
e m p l o y e d . T h e costumes a n d
general effervescence of the
performances are great fun, if a bit
overdone. Especially the brash and
frenetic Hotspur, played by Andrew
High Hopes
Set around King's Cross, High Hopes
examines the contrasting lives and
personalities of an assortment of
characters. Cyril, a despatch rider
and his girlfriend Shirley; his sister
Valerie and her husband Martin;
Jones. H i s over-the-top antics are
enjoyable to watch, but I couldn't
help feeling that it was all a bit too
eccentric.
In the second half the tone of the
play becomes more serious, as the
wars begin a n d loyalties
pronounced. But there are gems of
humorous interludes furnished by
Falstaff a n d w r y directional
flourishes: While the King's men are
attired in full regimental uniforms,
Falstaff does battle in World War II
camouflage gear, emphasising his
cowardliness. He is struck i n the
stomach by a sword, only toriseand
reveal a protected belly, shielded
with a 'no entry' sign. It is here that
he delivers his famous 'The better
part of valour is discretion' speech.
The characters a n d plot are
cemented together by an excellent
solid performance by John Dougall
as Prince H a l . I look forward to
seeing how he develops in Henry IV
pt 2.
I would recommend both these
productions, especially to those who
believe Shakespearean plays to-be
inaccessible, incomprehensible or
even, dare I say it, boring. The plots
and language are easy to follow and
one would feel better for the
experience.
Student standbys are available at
Â£6.
Next week Henry IV pt 2 and
Henry V .

Cyril's w i d o w e d mother, M r s
Bender and her yuppie neighbours
Laetitia and Rupert. Their paths
cross when Mrs Bender locks herself
out of her house and again when
Valerie arranges a party for her
mother's seventieth birthday.
Mike Leigh, the director has an
established reputation in producing
those gritty true-to-life plays that
win enormous critical praise. He has
successfully transferred this realism
to High Hopes to create a film that,
but for the farcical stereotypes of
Laetitia, Rupert, Valerie and Martin
would be little removed from a
documentary. T h e ludicrous
yuppies and social climbing Valerie
provide some relief but leave an
engaging yet unsatisfying mixture of
comedy and social observation.
So horrendous are the yuppies,
Valerie a n d her nasty wideboy
husband that you feel no animosity
towards them. So human are Cyril
and Shirley that you can sit and
wonder how they go cast with such
unhuman characters, although that
I assume was the intention. They
argue about C y r i l ' s doggedly
idealistic socialism and whether to
start a family or worry about M r s
Bender, a marvellous if chilling
portrayal of age and senility played
by Edna Dore.
This is not a frivolous film, and
more fun can be had d o w n the road
with Roger Rabbit. Yet for those
who prefer something a little more
testing, try High Hopes because the
note of optimism at the end more
than compensates for the dour plot.
