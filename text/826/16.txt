LIVE
Gigs
U L U , your loo, our loo. Let's face
it, the mergers bar at the University
of London Union is a bit of a toilet
when it comes to venues. O n free
gig night it is socially stifling. A
home for the hopelessly hip, serious
haircuts and sensitive young men
w h i s p e r i n g of M o r r i s s e y a n d
Dosdoevsky. In gigland however,
popularity is everything and U L U is
certainly that. It fields bands
regularly a n d draws a regular
crowd. W h y do people return again
and again? Why, after being aurally
assaulted by the likes of the James
Dean Driving Experience do hordes
come back? Cheap drink, free live
music or even the company? I think
it is the hope of seeing the
occasional gem like Frazier Chorus.
Frazier Chorus take the title men's
room and refurbish it into their very
own Dream Kitchen. They have a
head start o n the other bands
having a lead singer who looks like
Dave Gedge but they do have a
substance of their o w n . Tunes of
pure white wipe-clean formica float
out. H a r d to draw analogies with
other bands for Frazier Chorus are
more like y o u r favourite
Slumberdown than the wild, drug-
crazed youth of today. The songs
ain't all soft though, bite through
the marshmallow and you find the
saymg-something-solid centre of raw
lyric. If you haven't yet heard of
Frazier Chorus you will, and they're
good.
Perhaps not so endearing are King
Swamp playing in the concert hall of
U L U (for money). The press release
says 'these (obviously rich) English
boys were in N e w York looking for
a w a y out, Louisiana seemed
perfect'—bollocks. W h y did they
travel to L o u i s i a n a to writei
c o n v e n t i o n a l rock songs,:
Cricklewood would have sufficed J
The lead singer needed to practice
his pout and sultry looks, the gee-
tarists needed to grease their axes to
a v o i d friction burns a n d the
keyboard man spent some time
wanting to be in The Mission, going
bald a n d bumping into things
because his specs were too dark.
They sing songs of riding down
the interstate o n motorbikes
(pronounced 'sickles'), leather,
women and, of course, the ballad.
The lead singer was visibly pained
as he uttered the tale he was telling,
equity card i n t h e post.
Unfortunately, the biggest music
market i n the world, which shall
remain nameless, laps up exactly
this sort of Bon Halen Maiden group
so they will probably have more
success (and money) than the
former group. N o justice.
SINGLES
Texas
I don't want a lover
It is a long time since I have had a
new single with no centre i n it,
perhaps there is a message in that
somewhere. Texas appear to be
fronted by a female vocalist in the
style of Michelle Shocked, perhaps
the oil-state breeds this sort of your
woman. I don't want a lover is a
plodding four chord strummer that
bores. It is backed with 'Believe M e '
which sounds closer to Michelle
Shocked and is a better song.
Ford Cortina.
Thrashing
Doves
Jesus on the Payroll
A twelve inch single of four versions
of the same song. A soft drum club
version, plinky piano 'streetgroove'
verson and two normal versions
(one acoustic). A little excessive
considering the original song isn't
too exciting to start with. There are
shades of James Taylor and Mat.
Johnson on this record which can't
be bad. The Thrashing Doves have
been around a long time and it
appears tht they still can't get it
right.
Lada.
Jesus Jones
Let us Prey
Jesus Jones only managed to fit two
versions of the same song on their
record. Their energy a n d live
performing arrogance (see next
week's gigs) do not come across on
record but still the Wonderstuff in
them shines through. This sort of
confident noise band are
consolidating their position in the
new music scene. The best record of
this lot.

ALBUM
Rush
Show of Hands
Following last year's superb Hold
Your Fire tour, Rush have released
Show of Hands, a double live L P
showcasing the material from their
last four albums and culled from
two tours.
The shows were intensely visual
incorporating lasers and videos on
a stunning scale, and obviously this
aspect is lost on record for those
who were not there. (Although the
video promises to be something
special). However, the music has
been sympathetically mixed to
produce a live record of significantly
higher quality than normal.
Resisting the practice of
employing extra musicians for live
work, Geddy Lee uses a complex
system of programmed sythesizers
to enable h i m to simultaneously
play bass, keyboards and occasional
rhythm guitar. Backed by Neil
Peart's phenomenal drumming and
Alex Lifeson's deft, yet powerful,
guitar work they produce a sound
that has been aptly described as 'a
three piece symphony orchestra'.
Included on the L P is much of
Hold Your Fire such as the powerful
Force Ten and the hit single Time
Stand Still. But the highlights must
be on side three which incorporates
the menacing Distant Early Warning,
Mystic Rhythms and Witch-hunt in
which Lifeson extracts a spine-
tingling cadenza from the top string
of his guitar. The oldest song
included is the anthem Closer to the
Heart which stands up well twelve
years o n , despite sounding as
though from earlier phase.
Peart's indulgent drum solo The
Rhythm Method is the only
disappointment but does not detract
from a record that shows how
naturally Rush have progressed
from the hippies Fly By Night and
2112 to make music that is more
articulate and intelligent than most
other bands of the heavy rock genre.
Eight out of ten for the music but
only four for the sleeve which leaves
much to be desired considering the
visual nature of the concerts.
