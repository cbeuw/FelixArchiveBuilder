For too last fixtures of the seaaai
our teams competing hare been severely
weakened by the demands of exams. The
smallest team yet seen of 9 athletes
faced the might of Walton A.C. ana I.C.
ware defeated by 88 to 61 points. K

Ludlsa won fttTlong and quarter whilst
the discus went to A. Alooek.
T_he following day a rather tired
team defeated weak opposition from Guy's
Hospital at Brooklay rise, i a wet con-
ditions.
On Sat. 23rd May, I.C. was at f u l l
strength for" the toughest fixture of the
season against Heidelburg, Southampton
and Reading. Although the olnb scor-
ed the most points on the track, the
Germans were completely on their own i n
f i e l d events allowing them to win the
competition by 168 to 137i, with South-
ampton 9C-j and Reading 76 points. In
a howling, gale our sprinting was superb,
the relay being won i n 44-3 seconds
squalling the college record. Also,
K
.
W
. Indian b r i l l i a n t l y recorded 51.8
seconds to win the 44 yds.
On *ed. 20th May a weakened I.C.
team smashed a much weaker team from
Goldsmiths by almost scoring marl mat
points.
Finally, i n the last match of the
season i t was very pleasing to see I.C.
defeat St. SdmnndB Ball, Oxford, at
Hurlingham for the f i r s t tins i n three
years. Notable season's personal best
performances were 38' 4" for A. Aleoek
in the shot, and K

The National Gliding Championships
held at Lashaa during the week pre-
ceding Whitsun. It was the largest
GLiSing Championships ever held i n the
world with respect to the number of
g'tMmwS entered. The contest was
divided into two leagues, a l l Imp-
erial ^allege pilots flying i n Tsamnw
t. Frank Irving and B i l l Tonkyn
were placed fourth flying their
jointly owned Skylark III and won the
Team Trophy, previously held by.
Frank Irving and Paul Minton. This
trophy i s awarded to the glider,
flown by more than one pilot which i s
plaoeeT the highest. George Burton,
also flying a Skylark III, finished
sixth This was an excellent effort by
a l l tl« pilots concerned and puts them
in the running for selection for the
British team for the International
Championships i n Germany next year.
Paul Minton and Bernard Davey flew
"Phoenix", the olub's Skylark II but
were only able to make 31st place,
partly because they were flying against
higher performance aircraft and partly
because "Phoenix"is no longer In the
best of condition, a fact which was
only brought to light during the
Championships.

Since the last report of tne Club's
successes were mentioned in Felix,
the various teams have not been doing
so well. As always the club,is h i t
vert badly by examinations i n the
summer term and tne re3tilts show tnls.
fhs f i r s t team lost their unbeaten
record when they were trounced by
L.S.E. i n the U.i. Cup.' 'Although we
had beaten L.S.E. earlier ill the season,
their cup side was completely different
from their former team. The ' A ' team
had a ve^-y good viatory over Old Cowers
by 7 matches to 2^ but have since lost
to Southampton and Nottingham Univer-
sities.-- The second team too have lost
their unbeaten record losing to Kings,,
6-2.
The A.S.S. of the club w i l l be

bers of the club are asked to make a > *

Since the last report i n Felix the
1 s t I I have played six gemes, of which
two have been I.C. victories ana! the
remaining-four have been drawn. The
.nTml Whit-Monday trip to Hook result-
ed i a a good win for I.C. The, home
side slumped from 121 for 5 to 134 a l l
out (Beam 5 far 29: Clarke 4 for 12.)
and I.C. h i t off the runs f o r the
loss of 7 wickets (Hoarn 65). There
are two cricket teams which hove
the name "Hook*, one i n Hampshire and
the other i n Surrey, but, despite the
valiant efforts o f one member of \3ie
team, i t has proved impossible to
play both sides on the same day.
The second. '. .Z. victory was
against U.C. Hospital. In a very
quick scoring game U.C.K. made 153
for 9 before declaring and I.C.
scored 156 far 2 (Bartholomew 77:
White 63 n. o. ).
The drawn games have usually been
closely contested: throe of them
have been played on Harlington wickets
where i t i s a relatively easy matter
to "bat out time". The game against
Woolwich Poly, produced.some very slow
searing and i t was not until the last
ten minutes of the game that runs came
quiokly. Thanks to tne 'Poly', con-
vention of declaring at tea time we
were l e f t with 135 minutes to score
123 runs (Woolwich 122 for 8) but i t
was only with ten minutes left and 30
runs needed that any real effort was
nade to push the 3core along. This
can be attributed to a "middle order"
collapse,'for after an opening stand of
53 we were 72 for 6. W
e finally
totalled 116 for 8.:(Bushby 37).
Against South Row I.C. were bowled
out, for the only time this season,
- for 122 ( J . Webster '26 -n. o.) , And i n
reply South Row. scored '110 f o r 7
(GalbaHy^3-far 21).
The last three games, two drawn
(against S. Mersham and Charing Cross
Hospital) and the victory over U.C.H.,
have been notable for the ability of
the early order batsmen to score runs.
W
e totalled 175 for 7 against
'Mershem, (Kapur 43: J. Vebster 55
in. o.) who replied with 122 for 7, and
209 far 3 against Charing Cross Hos-
p i t a l (White 77 n. 0. Kapur 55 and Bar-
tholomew 47)* Charing Cross replied
with 146 -far 3. This game was not-
able for the'fact that i n the last
twenty minutes I.C. dropped six oat-
•^hos. The bowler Who' suffered most
to the extent of seeing five balls f l y
off the edge into the slips or to the
Wi cket keeper only to be dropped, was
Betteridge who finished with 3 for 23.
At this stage In the season i t i s
possible to assess the strength of the
side. One notable fact i s that despi-
te losses due to examinations and to
injusios- the l s t XI seems to maintain
Its standard; this i s a tribute t o
.the strength of the 2nd XI. The f i r s t
H bowling i s good and since the " t a i l "
does not start until number 10 the
jetting i s also strong but the one large
aloud on the horizon fs the inability
of the close fielders to hang on to
catches. This deficiency i s the prime
reason for the large number of drawn
games. There i s one consolation for
this however and that i s that each "ch-
ance" o f a. catch that i s not taken
costs the offending player bd., and the
definition of a "ohanoe" i s very liberal,
coat. ool. 2.
