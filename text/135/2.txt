A CLOSED SHOP ? *
The following unsclioited letter
was given to the Editor of Felix,
by i t s author. After reading i t ,
and being a l i t t l e dubious about the
soaewhat personal remarksmade i n i t
and acting on a suggestion contained
within the letter itself, the Editor
sought a more o f f i c i a l view of the
Selkirk Hall situation.
This offioial statement i s te
be seen below following the original
letter. I think i t should be added
that this statement, although termed
offioal, i s not by one of the 3
gentlemen named.
Dear Editor,
For the f i r s t time for a consider-
able number of years Selkirk Hall, the
I.C. College hostel in Holland Park,
is to be opened to postgraduate students.
Whether or not this is a good pro-
position remains to be seen, and i t i s
_/not my purpose to comment on i t here.
.Next year w i l l also be the f i r s t year
of office of a warden from the Admin-
istrative Staff and i t would be as
well to point out that the warden i s
solely responsible for selecting
applicants for admission to Selkirk.
The wider terms of admission
have not been made public to member!
of the Union in general, indeed i t was
only by chance that the present
residents of Selkirk were informed.
Those Selkirk residents who are
to become postgraduate students next
year and who wished to return n»xt
Session, re-applied for admission and
were, for the main part, accepted.
To the best of ay knowledge only
three postgraduate applications were
Bade from outside Selkirk. These were
forwarded by Mr. J. B e l l (Sec. I.C..
Union), Mr. H. Espig (Chairman S.C.C.)
and Mr. R. Garnett (Pres. I.C. Union.).
Of these three, Mr. Espig and Mr.
Garnett have been accepted far residence.
I understand that the reason for having
postgraduates i n Selkirk i s that they
might be a guiding influence on under-
graduates in their work, and also to
act as a "P.G. sta aut governing body"
to run the hostel.
These are the facts as I know
•nc1
I wish to make the following'
oomments:-
F i r s t l y Mr. Garnett has already
had three years' residence in the new
hostel, the marl mum permissible for a
Onion President i n a College hostel'.
He i s also a College Demonstrator and
w i l l undoubtedly have enough funds to
afford alternative accommodation.
Secondly, I read i n the "Times"
that Mr. Espig has been awarded a
Beit Fellowship of £600/annum. The
sane oomments as above apply. Thirdly
trp to now i t has not been found nec-
essary to provide undergraduates a
guiding hand. Nor i s i t necessary.
Students are chosen students on those
qualities which w i l l enable then to
work and manage their lives in a
responsible manner. "Big Broth**"
tactioe w i l l not bring the erring stu-
dent to heel.
Fourthly, i t has .
a general principle that residents
should be selected in equal numbers frem
each constituent College, and that once
aocepted, providing there is no miscon-
duct, he w i l l remain in residence for
two years. This year, however, a Kinor
after only -j year' at Selkirk, has been
told that he w i l l be unable to return
owing to the excessive number of Hines-
men. It would therefore appear that
he i s being pushed out in favour of Mr.
Garnett, who is also a Minesman.
Fifthly, certain residents at Selkirk
have been invited back for a third year,
despite the fact that i t is generally
understood and laid down in t i e rules
for Admission of Residents 1959/60,
that two years i s the maximum period
of residence i n a College hostel for a
student not holding Union office.
I feel, Mr. Editor, that these
remarks speak for themselves and that
your members of I.C. w i l l be able to
draw their own conclusions.
1 should here mention that the
fact that I am a resident at Selkirk
in no way colours my opinions, since
I shall be undertaking P.G. studies
at King's College, Newcastle next Ses-
sion. I 3hall be grateful for any
correction that can be made to" the
content of this letter, and would also
weleeae a reply from those in a posi-
tion so to do.
Tours sincerely,
R.D. Leigh
Mining 3.,
(1) There has been no change i n the
method of selection at Selkirk.
How then has anything been kept
ijuiet?
(2) The addition of a few P.G.'a merely
brings Selkirk into line with the
general College policy as adopted
in the other hostels.
(3) Next year there w i l l be five resi-
dents from each 'Constitueat College.
(4) The 2-year limit of residence
applies to the Beit Hall and Garden
Hall.
(5) Some of the people who have been
turned down for residence next year-
have been so treated on the advice
of the retiring warden and others.
(6) At £27 per term, Selkirk i s not thJ
cheapest place to live at. Perha-
ps a l l students with parents earn-
ing in excess of say £2,000 p. a.
or with grants of £350 p.a. or fcore
should be restricted from applic-
ation to any College hostel*
(7) Any Resident's Committee whioh
may be elected, w i l l boelaoted
from the students sad by- the
students. There seems net-
reason why any such ooaaittas
should not operate i n the Same
unobtrusive manner as the equi-
valent oommittees at the other
X.C. Hostels.
(8) In addition to the above named
applicants for residence next year
there were at least ten other
P.G.'s, not resident i n Salkirk, s
reasonable number i t would seem
for the two places which were award-
ed. It i s difficult to imagine
why Mr. Leigh should ahoose to
mention only one of the unsuccess-
ful applicants unless the sour—
aess of this particular grape (to
use a soaewhat mixed metaphor)
is related to the position of res- -
ponsibility to whioh that person
has been elected.
(9) Under the rules of adraission to
Selkirk Hall a student i s not re-
fused because he has already r e s i -
ded for the ma.xi mum period i n the
Beit Hall, since Selkirk Hall ia
entirely separate from the other
Halls of Residence at I.C.
Perhaps spending one's time running a
Union, for which the only immediate
reward is the satisfaction of having
done the work, for the likes of Mr.
Leigh should thus exclude one from even
applying far the faoilities open to
a l l members of the Union. It i s a
pity that &. Leigh has now left i t
too late to do anything more construe-

Imperial College i s perhaps the
premier scientific oollege of England,

The Society has produced a variety

they have ranged from Moliere's "THE
