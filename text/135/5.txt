S.C.C.
Deer Sir, •
I m i surprised end a l i t t l e pertur-
bed to reed in your newspaper two letters
oritioiaing the S.C.C. i n the terns
"Disgusted, soandal and Sabotage".
Surely the writers of these letters
realise that had the decision been
reversed there would almost certainly
- hare bean two wore fran your aeny
readers who would have rushed to
their pens with suoh words as "disgusted,
scandal, aabotage, bolshevik, pacifist,
faoist, warmonger eta."

Only two weeks ago the aoat
popular sport in the Carnival fata
appeared to be ducking the president.
This circumstance i a unfortunate, but
whilst i t exists let us be rational
about i t and realise that committee*
are groups of individuals and not
Just one scheming e v i l •lad plotting
to suppress and frustrate the student
at every opportunity. Sueh ooaadttees
are elected by the students through
their respective societies and have a
responsibility, not only to the few
enthusiasts for a new sooiety, but
to the mass of students in general,
looking at a committee i n this way
and realising that i t has no personal
axe to grind phrases such as soatrial
aabotage, e t c are reduced to the
level of emotional i l l mannered,
petulance on the part of those whose
views hare been rejected. Incident-*
ally your correspondents should get
together sometine, perhaps they
oould decide coldly and unemotionally
Just who rejected what.
Tours faithfully,
John K. Low*.

PEACE SOCIETY
Dear S i r ,
In the last issue of 'Felix' you
published two letter* concerning the
Peace Sooiety. This proposed society
has received a great deal of publioity
in 'Felix' this year and I feel i t i s
time that someone cleared up the con-
troversy surrounding i t . The view*
expressed in these letters and those of
Mr. Finney earlier this session are a
blatant misrepresentation of the truth
and are probably based on rumour rather
than on faot. It i s a pity that
supposedly educated people cannot check
up on their information before writing
hasty letter* to •Felix'.
The Peso* Society was not rejected
by Union Council. When I informed the
Council that the f i r s t reading of the
Peaea Sooiety had been passed by the
S.C.C., the members expressed no view*.
At the next meeting of the S.C.C. a
number of societies stated that they
were already doing what the proposed
aoolety was setting out to do. The
S.C.C. whioh consists of 40 member*
therefore rejected the Peace Sooiety
because there i s no need to have a
new aooiety which duplicates the work
of existing societies. It i s sur-
prising that Mr. Finney, the proposer of
the Peaoe Sooiety, did not approach
these societies to see what i s being
don* on the topic for Peace i n the Union
before trying to form i t . The Inter-
nations! Relations Club have offered
Mr. Finney the facilities of their olub
to bold function* concerned with Peaoe.
I would also like to state that
the Peaoe Society was not to be a
branch of the 8.H.D. and when asked
what the political views of the soc-
iety would be, the pi'upoamw stated
that i t would be none p o l i t i c a l .
There waa no atteapt to sabotage the
formation of the Peaoe Society by
Union Official*. The decision not
to fora the aooiety waa sad* by the
S.C.C. whioh consist* of 40 people
drawn from the olub* of this College.
X might add that the majority of the
mamb»T* voted against the formation
and very few voted for the aooiety.
X hope that you will publish this
latter i n f u l l so that the members of
the union amy knew what has happened
over the Peaoe Society and amy draw
the correct conclusion*.
Tours sincerely,
H.S. Bapig
Chairman I.C. Social Club* Committee.

Sir,
I was highly amused by the tone
of Mr. Moir'a letter in your last iaaue
dealing with the diffioultle* of ob-
taining a fair hearing for Irving-
type view-points in the face of the
exaggerated bis* shown towards 'agal-
itarianism' by the national pre**, etc.
It conjure* up delightful image* of
cringing fascists, their Jackboots and
rubber truncheons confiscated, their
moderate and unobjectionable articles
torn up, being kicked unceremoniously
out of newspaper offices, or bleating
meekly and unsuccessfully at public
meetings in an effort to make their
mild and reasoned pleaa for the Immed-
iate construction of concentration
camps for the liquidation of reactionary
elements heard above the raucous din of
the masses, Intolerantly using their
decadent and anti-progressive freedom
of speeoh to proclaim such absurd bour-
geois prejudioes aa the dignity of the
Individual.
However, from his own point of view,
I f a i l to see quit-* what Mr. Moir ia
beefing about. Discarding aa he doe*
the concept of equality, why should he
feel hard done by at not eeoelving equal
treatment to the exponents of liberty
at the hands of the national press?
It i s a failing common to a l l the**
'progressive' authoritarian ideologies
that their supporters assume that thaw
should be the ones to be more, and not
lesa, equal than others.
Thanks to Mr. Moir'» enlightened
idea* having been given a f a i r hearing
k> certain countries, we now know them
for that they are worth. A fat ohanoe
of a f a i r hearing do the ideals of
equality get in suoh countries
Tours sincerely,
D.B.H. Jonea.
