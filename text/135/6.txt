SECURITY INFORMATION
Dear Sir,
It ia time that this unspeskabls
arista was revealed. To the South of
the Uniop Building there lies a plot
consisting of a beautifully maintained
mosaic of building aite turves, known
as the Beit Quadrangle Lawn. Apart
from Tortoise racing, this stretch of
verdant pasture has an important
function - to connect the Serology
Department to the Bar. A glance
at the plan aa seen from the Zoology
roof, from the left of the dustbins,
w i l l show that the route to the Bar
from this seething animal container,
i s very indirect. Those readers with
an inherent ma theme,';ioal ability w i l l
quickly calculate, and drinkers w i l l
see immediately, that i f the paths
had been built the other way around
with the present South end to the
North, then our route to the foe-trail
and dart board would have been easier.
Who i s to blame? It i s obvious
that the Staff of Zoology have thought
up this cunning ruse as a deterrent to
their worthy soholars' relaxation.
Now what difference does this make,
you readers are asking? Why, the i n -
human wastage of five seoonds time per
day - valuable time whioh i s meant for
drinking and dart play. (Incidentally,
i t i s sinoerely hoped that a l l who read
this w i l l show reverence to the word
'dart', by devoutly removing their ooats
raising their glasses and repeating my
well-known toast of "Right then, down
the old er - right then." may I take
this opportunity of answering the con-
tinuously occurring question as to why
I drink. I do so for the sake of
medical science, to ensure that the
colours of my stomach wall are perfect-
ly preserved. To this aim I can tin-
reservedly recommend the hobby of
beer tasting.)
Solutions to problem:-
i ) Turn the Quad around,
i i ) Turn the Quad buildings around
i l l ) PLOTL. (Pipe line under the
lawn.
iv) Open a bar i n the Zoology Dept.
I see that the Bar i s open again,
and so I dip m
y dart point i s the ink
once more to remain,
Tours umciaasedly,
Charles Neville, Dart.

It can hardly have escaped notioe
that elections are with us again.
The notioe boards have been inflicted
with a series of election l i s t s covered
with a rash of grubby, unreadable
signatures. The internal notioe board
carries a series of smarmy profiles of
would-be bureaucrats, identified by
leering photographs. One would think
that this was Scotland lard's rogues
gallery, were i t not for the fact that
the profile rarely corresponds to a true
description of the subject.
Profile writers are a strange bread,
worthy to s i t i n on the most diplomatic
uhember. They sell their man with the
air of a seasoned autioneer, loyally
hiding a l l his faults and boosting his
assets, to such a degree that the whole
thing becomes a downright l i e . Why
do they do i t ? One reason of oourse i s
free beer and cigarettes. It i s the
done thing for the prospective candidate
to invite his loyal supporters to the
bar at least once a week. Another
reason i s that the profiler likes to
think that he i s the power behind the
throne. Tet a third reason i s tnat he
belongs to a clique whioh wants to keep
or gain power. The following i s a
typical example of a clique at work.
B proposes A for president and C
and D second him. A proposes C for
secretary and B and D second him.
D proposes B for treasurer and A and C
seoond him. C proposes D for committe<
member and A and B seoond him.

Believe me, i t usually works.
Now What about these candidates who
allow themselves to be displayed and
lauded i n suoh a fashion. What are they
after? Partly of oourse i t i s power,
but the most important reason i s that
they want to be "a somebody ". THEY W
A
N
T
TO BE KNOWN. To be just an ordinary
student, a nobody, serving on no commit-
tees, i s to them a sign of absolute
failure. Even i f they only become hen.
junior assistant treasurer of the
madrigal revivalist society they have
become a soracbo&y.
The most pathetio case of the no-
body who wants to become a somebody i s
the man who gets himself proposed for
6 posts, hoping that he might get on at
least one. To see him slinking away as
the election results confirm him an
incurable nobody i s a sight to tear at
your heart strings.
Personally, I am a self-appointed
nobody and intend remaining so. Would
anvbody oare to propose me for president?
