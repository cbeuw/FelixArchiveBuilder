Editmial Comment
With this Editorial, I reaoh
the end of ny service on "Felix". Have
I been a good or bad Editor - or worse,
just indifferent? Only you can answer
that; for myself I know that above a l l
I have enjoyed this position and the
actual production of "Felix" (even when
that has been left solely i n my hands!)
Felix i s more than just another
student newspaper - i t i s a tradition
that I hope I have strengthened, but
an Editor must have a staff and eternal
praise and credit are due to the follow-
ing regular members:-
Photographic Editor - Paul Porgess
Sports Editor - Keith Ludlam
Features Editor - Peter Crabtree
Production Assistant - Brian Rosooe
Cartoonists - Boole and Mao
Without two members of the Felix
staff - our typists, Sheila Hobday and
Cells Kyle - we could never have appear-
ed (at any time) They say that they
have enjoyed working with us - such
women are rare!! To these people
and to my predecessors (who wish to
remain anonymous - for evermore) who
have helped and to Mr. Tony 'Droamboat'
Ewart who stayed with us until attracted
by higher things (?), I wish to extend
my deepest thanks.
May I leave you with this thought:
I know most of you look, act and
think like sheep, but that does not give
you the right to stray a l l over the
Beit grass. An eminent botanist has
asked me to t e l l you to "Keep off the
grass".

Tennis at Wimbledon, rowing at Hendly

W STATE CIRCUS opened last
Saturday at the Empire Pool Wembley,
and remain there until July 18th.
There is much Impressive acrn^iilua, and
strange magic, though less emphasis
on the animals than i s usual i n this
country.
The Royal Tournament continues at
Earls Court until June 20th.
The year the centenary of Big Ben i s
being oelebrated, and to mark this i s
.an exhibition at the Jewel Tower,
Estminster, showing models and docu-
ments depicting the dock's history.
Open until mid-September.
A tercentenary also occurs this year,
that of the birth of Furoell: part of
the celebrations include a version of
Shakespeare's TEMPEST, for whioh Purcell
composed the music. It opened at the
Old Via last Tuesday.
A new comedy at the Qerriok Theatre
having a promising east is Farewell,
Farewell Eugene: Margaret Rutherford
and Peggy Mount are always good for a
laugh, regardless of the script.

(l) Peter Kassler has purchased a
Vespa scooter, .and i t i s rumoured
that he i s taking over Riohard
Garnett's 'L' plates. It i s hoped
that they will bring the new owner
a l i t t l e more luck.
(2) A very dapper-looking Tony Bwart,
alias "Mr. I.C.W.A.", was given a
great sand-off at Viotoria Station
last week when he departed for Peru,
The party consisted of many sorrow-
' f u l looking members of I.C.W.A. and
and a party of men looking as i f
they were thankful to be r i d of him.
(3) Last year's President's Dinner and
Dance produced 3 engagements, so the
men of I.C. are warned to be on their
guard.
(4) Now that the Hostel selections are
completed Frank Irving i s no longer
able to dispose of an endless supply
of free drinks i n the Bar. However,
present and future members of
Council are advised that now i s the
time for the free beer to flow i n
the late evening.
(5) Examination fever i s running high.
John Blok, an old veteran and now
starting on his 3rd attempt, has
put himself into hospital by trying
to out off his right thumb. He
is now trying to pass his exams on
compassionate grounds.

Another such play i s The Crass i s Green-
er: the plot i s weak as a whole, but
the show is worth seeing for the excel-
lent acting by Cells Johnson and Joan
Greenwood. St. Martin's Theatre.
The twenty f i f t h season of the Open A i r
Theatre i n Regent Park opens on 15th
June with a performance of Twelth Ni-
ght.
If the oast of a film i s any criterion,
two which are worth looking out f o r i n
the next few months are The Wreak of _
Mary Deare, starring Gary Cooper and '
Charles Heston with Michael Redgrave,
Emlyn Williams and Cecil Parker, and
Our Han i n Havana, starring Alec Culmeas
Maureen O'Hare, Noel Coward, Burl
Ives, produced by Carol Reid.
As long as comparison i s not made
with the play, the film of The
Diary of Anne Frank, telling of the
efforts of a Jewish g i r l and her fam-
i l y to hide from the Nasis i n Holland
in 1942, i s extremely moving and well
produoed. The obvious limitations i a
making a film of an essentially one-
room action apply, but the plight of
Anne, played by Millie Perkins, w i l l
not be soon forgotten.
If you happen to be i n a cinema at the
right time, do not miss the trailer of
Horrors of the Black Museum: but the
film isn't worth seeing.
(6) It appears that the stringent rules
regarding the exclusion of ladies
from the Bar have been relaxed
lately. Mrs. Robb. spent one
evening i n there last week downing
her pint.
(7) Norman Crossland, the President of
the I.C. Underwater Club has recent-
ly written an article for the Sub-
Aoua Club magasine about the forth-
coming expedition to the Azores.
A photograph showing Clair Brooks
i s entitled "The only woman on the
expedition." Close by i t reads
"The Azores - where soienoe should
be fun!'' We are surprised at Nor-
man especially since he i s a married
