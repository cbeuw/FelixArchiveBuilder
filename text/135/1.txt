No 135 END OF TERM EDITION - SUMMER, 1959. 4d
KINGS EDITOR REPLIES
The Editor of this newspaper was
very pleased to reeieve the following
letter from the Editor of "King"3 News",
a s a result of the front-page artiole
that appeared.
Dear Sir,
I read with interest your front-
page artiole in your issue of May 22nd
concerning oriticism of "Felix". As
Editor of a printed oollege newspaper,
I feel that these criticisms are fair.
You justify your paper's appearance
by saying that whereas "Felix" makes a
profit, i f £2 oan be oalled a profit,
the glossy "PI" costs i t s Union Society
between £200 and £400 a year. While
this may be true of "PI" and other
oollege newspapers, i t i s certainly not
true of "King's News", the newspaper of
King's College Union Society. During
the last year, our total trading loss
has amounted to under ten pounds, a l -
though f i f t y pounds has been spent on
offloe equipment. Our circulation i s
only 1,100, and the paper only, oosta i t s
readers threepence.
•
W
h
y i s i t that our loss i s only a
minute fraction of that of "Pi"?
There are two reasons. Firstly, "King's
News" i s not a glossy newspaper. I t
is printed on ordinary newsprint, whioh
I feel is more suited to a newspaper than
the heavier magazine paper used by so
many university and oollege newspapers.
Secondly, "King's News" i s not printed
in London. While this has i t s disad-
vantages in the make-up of the paper
- we do not see any proofs of the paper
- i t i s certainly a lot cheaper.
By making these two economies, we
are able to survive without making a
serious loss. However, to print a news-
paper i n this way s t i l l costs money.
This i s where advertising plays i t s
part. The printing b i l l for our paper
comes to an average of £53 per issue,
of whioh five-sixths i s paid for by
advertising. If you are so set against
advertising, then of oourse you cannot
hope to publish a printed paper; but
surely i t is better to have advertis-
ing in an attractive newspaper, than no
advertising in an unattractive paper.
So, I regard your excuse as a
rather weak excuse. If one oollege
oan publish a good newspaper without
waving a serious loss, then surely anot-
her oan. It i s only f a i r to point cut
that i f Imperial College want a real
newspaper, they will have to pay before
they reap the benefit. For change-
over oould not be done for nothing.
Finally, I would like to rein-
force your remarks concerning weekly
publication. It is a l l very well for
those wno read a paper: few realise
the time and trouble that goes into pub-
lishing a paper, or how difficult i t
sometimes is to f i l l a l l the gaps even
in a fortnightly publication.
Yours faithfully,
David J. Hardwiok,
Editor, "King's News"
A re-reading of both my own front
page article and the above letter has
led me to agree that the argument I put
forward about advertising was a weak
one; however, i t is true that no big
advertiser would wish to appear in a
paper produced by the present process.
To attract big advertisers - such
as appear in the King's newspaper, we
should first have to turn out a printed
"Felix" - i.e. this means an i n i t i a l
outlay of oapital. It depends on the
Union as to whether this is eventually
done.
I should like to thank the Editor
of King's News very much for his
interesting letter and I think that
he may have given the Felix Board some-
thins to consider carefully.
THE MAY BALL
There is no doubt that the First
Imperial College May Ball, which was
planned in the face of severe student
pessimism, was an unqualified sucoess.
The fa«t that the 300 double tickets
were sold within 4 days and that f i r s t
year students were in the majority do
prove undoubtedly that there i s space
in the I.C. sooial calendar for an
Annual May Ball.
The Entertainments Committee i s
one of the oost hard-worked and least-
rewarded committees in the Union and I
should like to record here m
y thanks to
them, and especially John Sheldon the
Chairman and Susan Coombs the Secretary.
It i s to these two, with their imagina-
tion and relentless hard work, that we
owe the sucoess of the First Annual May
Ball.
R.H.T. Qarnett
President, I.C. Union.
• C H A D W I C K I A N S -
Inspired by Mr. John Chadwiok's
diotum that "Constitutent college mas-
cots should be removed to a safe plaos
as a reminder of the hooliganisms of the
past", several members of R.C.S. moved
the Guilds Spanner to one of the most
peaoeful spots i n the British Isles.
Seeing the events of Field Cup after-
noon, an anonymous geologist decided to
walk off with the Guilds Clark-high
implement, and did so, after which i t
was rapidly transported to the Hostel,
and, the next morning, to N0 rth Wales.
Apparently a large red and silver
spanner is a great asset while hitch-
hiking, as motorists stop out of shear
curiosity - the result being that i t
reached the Pen-y-Pass Hotel in the
Llanberis Pass that same evening,
and the summit of Snowdon before night-
f a l l .
The only hitch i n the opera-
tion was that the removing squad
failed to get back down to the Pen-
y-Cwiyd Hotel before closing time.
The spanner now rests high above the
conflicts of mankind, secure from any
but the most determined hooliganism,
and seems likely to remain there for
some time; a situation of whioh a l l
keen Chadwiokians should thoroughly
aonrove.
P.K.
TRAGIC DEATH-
We would like to express our deep
regret at the death of George Fraser, who]
demonstrated his s k i l l as an athlete and
as one of Britain's greatest climbers,
during his period as a P.G. i n Guild's
last year.
