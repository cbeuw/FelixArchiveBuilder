4 - F E L I X , O C T O B E R 21st 1976
After an absence of two w e e k s , this
magnificent tome i s ready and a s it
lands with a dusty thud on C l i v e ' s
desk a l l that i s required i s a n explanation
about the missing two a r t i c l e s . Well,
Ctive put about the story that there were
technical problems in the first week but
really he spent a l l week floating back
to earth after the compliments he received
for the Freshers F E L I X . Having managed
to squeeze his head back into the office,
he duly managed to edit my article last
week. Not only d i d he edit it, he a l s o
didn't print it!
...So this week we get a bumper edition...
NUS Travel Office
For those o l d lags who remember that
there once used to be a travel office, and
for those Freshers w h o wonder why it
isn't open, here is the unabridged version
of what the f . . . k ' s going o n . F i r s t l y ,
the NUS Travel Office i s situated in the
Union Lower Lounge next to the pinball
machines, but y o u may have noticed the
total lack of s a l e s assistants in the
Office. N o w N U S T S a r e on a 7-year
contract (until 1980) to use that room a s
a Travel Centre and up to now, ie s i n c e
J u l y , they haven't opened it. A constant
stream of phone c a l l s to the N U S T S
headquarters h a s failed to get them to
to provide us with the necessary staff
although a couple of swift reminders
about the room hire (£200 p.a.) fell on
more fertile s o i l . S o the present position
is that the Union i s raking in £200 p . a .
for a room which i s never used and y o u
have to g o to V i c t o r i a t o get your r a i l -
cards, e t c . F i n a l l y , to quote a lettpr
from C h r i s Morgan, ( N U S National
Treasurer) . . . 'the Board (NUSTS) and
the E x e c ,NUS) have been concerned . . . to
define a means for preserving N U S T S L t d .
s o that it c a n continue to offer i t s
services to our membership.' Seems
quite simple to me, C h r i s -r. O P E N T H E

CVCP Report
I have received 3 c o p i e s of the
Report by the Committee of V i c e -
Chancel lors and P r i n c i p a l s of the
U n i v e r s i t i e s of the U . K . on the period

Club Captains
One o f the topics for d i s c u s s i o n at
the Union C o u n c i l on the 25th October i s
whether life-members of the Union are
entitled to captain c l u b s within the
Union. A n y c l u b s w h o have life members'
as C a p t a i n , President or committee
members should inform me in the Union
(int 3915) s o that w e have a compre-
h e n s i v e list before w e start d i s c u s s i o n s .
Keep on Trucking
Due to a very generous offer from a
teaching member of the P h y s i c s staff, the
Union may w e l l find itself in possession
of a truck. T h e truck hasn't been M . O . T ' d
for four years but it i s i n good nick
(honest). If anyone h a s a need for a
large truck and i s w i l l i n g to look after it
then get i n touch with me. The truck w i l l
be free t o the most worthy c a u s e (after
slipping me a couple of quid).
St. Catherine's, Cumberland Lodge.

The cost (for Friday tea to Sunday tea)

pound-for-pound by the foundation.
A p p l i c a t i o n forms from me in the U n i o n .
A l s o , a weekend on " M u s i c " is

It's Tuesday morning and
I've an apalling hangover —
a g a i n . What with a reception at
Senate House last night a n d
Freshers' dinners and C o m -
memmoration B a l l , I'm in a
permanent alcoholic stupor,
which . doesn't really help to
get my work out of the way.
Apart from w h i c h , it s t i l l
takes me ten minutes to fight
my way into my office due to
the besieging hordes in search
of discount cards and similar
goodies.
The Union i s being used
