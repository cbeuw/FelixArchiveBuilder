Fine all-
round
rugby
The game began with I C
having slightly more of the
play than Q M C ; However after
about !4 hour a s e t piece
resulted in a Q M C overlap
which sent" their wing over for
a try which was converted.
IC responded strongly and
within ten minutes the pressure
was rewarded when Robins
picked up from the base of the
scrum a n d went over for a
fine try. Cotter converted to
level the scores. T h e remainder
of the first half was played out
with some exciting rugby by
both teams but with no addition
to the scoreline.
In the second half I C
attacked from the whistle and
were unlucky not to take the
lead when Cotter attempted a
40yd dropkick which dipped
under the bar at the last
moment. F i v e minutes later
Williams was too unlucky not
to score. H i s patience w a s
rewarded soon after when he ran
in a try from 30 yards. T h e try
was unconverted (score 10—6).
QMC replied strongly but
IC countered with a fine try
following a serging burst of
speed by A s p d e n , who laid the
b a l l off to the eager support of
scrum-half Price-Step hens.
Cotter again converted.
In the last !4 hour I C
defended some fine tackling
from both backs and forwards
the most "outstanding, being
due to West. F i n a l score 16—6.
