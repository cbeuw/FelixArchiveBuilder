Polo team waddle their
way to success
The IC Water-polo' team has
made a further step towards
the Middlesex league water-polo
first d i v i s i o n championship,
with a sensational 11—5
victory over P e n g u i n . Despite
the weakening of the team, due
to the absence of the ' A n i m a l '
and Andy Smith, this w a s
indeed one o f the finest ever
performances by the I C team.
In fact it w a s only last year
that w e were promoted after
winning the second d i v i s i o n ,
and we now require only one
further point to c l i n c h the
title.
K o s t a R i b a r had flown i n
from A b u Dhabi e s p e c i a l l y for
this c r i t i c a l match and started
off playing in goal. We were
glad of h i s presence, a s the
experienced Penguin attack
peppered the I C goal w i t h shots
The I C defense however stuck
together, and the P e n g u i n
players began shooting w i l d l y
from too far out. K o s t a , using
his vast experience plucked
these long shots out of the
air e a s i l y , and fed the ball out
to the I C players.
The first goal came from a
long pass to C l i f f Spooner
who was playing i n the 'sitting
forward' p o s i t i o n . T h e referee
wasn't g i v i n g ' very much
away, and after a b i t of a
wrestling match, the y e l l o w
water-polo b a l l eventually
found its w a y into the corner
of the net. T h i s w a s a remark-
able feat for C l i f f , whose hand
flicked the ball i n ; a s h i s
head was three feet below
the water, and the degree of
contortion involved for this
manouvre would h a v e done
justice to a n y Y o g a student.
H i s ' b a d l e g ' seems to have
mended.
Good defensive work by
Dave Lowther usual game
gave Penguin no breathing
space at a l l , and gave I C a
2 - 0 lead at the start of the
second quarter.
Brutality
Penguin, however, were
no pushover and they came
back strongly at the start .of
the second quarter to l e v e l the
score. I C q u i c k l y replied with
three quick g o a l s , one each
from the two McCartneys a n d
one from P a u l Hindle. Soon
after one of the Penguin
players w a s ordered out for
brutality; Rory L e w i s then
proceded to score from a
'man-up' p o s i t i o n . T h i s put IC
four clear at half time.
For the rest of ^the match
Iain B a l e s came into play in
goal and Kosta played o u t .
Although very experienced,
the Penguin team were not
quite a s fit a s u s , and relent-
less I C pressure proved too
much for some of them, w h o
began to tire.
Hat-trick
Michael McCartney finished
off h i s hat-trick and P e t e r
McCartney got one o f h i s
typical flukey g o a l s , from a
long-shot. P e n g u i n , however,
penetrated the I C defense
q u i c k l y with two long shots i n
reply; the score w a s thus
9 - 4 at the e n d of the third
quarter.
The match w a s rounded off
with a goal each from C l i f f
and P a u l , and a consolation
goal near the e n d to P e n g u i n .
B y that time the IC team were
setting their sights on the
next match i n the championship,
at w h i c h they hope to c l i n c h
the title.
The club meets Mondays
and F r i d a y s 7—0pm, i n the
sports centre, just bring your
togs and turn up.

Training: vital for a good season
There are two short words
which strike terror into the
legs o f the members of I C X -
country c l u b — ' P a r l y H i l l ' .
These refer to Parliament H i l l
F i e l d s on the southern part of
Hamstead Heath. T h e first
Saturday of the term saw the
first of seven races to be held
there, University of London
( U L ) v s B l a c k h e a t h . T h i s
incorporated the U L trial.
I C turned out in force with
both refreshed stalwarts a n d
exuberant freshers.
The field of forty seven
included two young l a d i e s ,
who whilst surviving only
half of the 5V2 m i l e s , l e d over
half the I C team. Conditions
for the race were perfect and
times' were fast considering
this was the first race of the
season. Dave R o s e n ran w e l l
to finish 5th i n the creditable
time o f 29mins 2 0 s e c s , P a u l
Clarke w a s next i n , coming 9th
with the new A n d y Davey
following in a disappoint-
ing 19th.
T h e following Wednesday,
IC entertained a number of

For the first two Wednesdays
of term a n enthusiastic group
of ladies gathered down at
at Putney to start the rowing
year. With both Morphy D a y
and a U L regatta this term, the

ladies a s p o s s i b l e rowing
soon.
New members received
b a s i c coaching from experienced
oarsmen both o n a rowing
tank and on the river; and
everybody seemed to enjoy
this. Once again prospective

CONFIDENCE
Westfield vIC
Imperial C o l l e g e M i x e d
Hockey Team got the s e a s o n
off to a fine.start with a 2—1
victory over Westfield C o l l e g e .
However it w a s Westfield w h o
took the initiative early o n ,
when the I C defense w a s
caught in* a mess and allowed
the Westfield forwards through
to score.
After this initial lapse I C
began to get o n top, a s p a s s i n g
became more accurate. T h i s
brought both increased confid-
ence and the equalizer, a fine
individual effort b y T i m
Marshall. H e a l s o h a d a hand
in the second g o a l , drawing the
goal-keeper out before p a s s i n g
the b a l l to T a r i q Sethin, w h o
had no difficulty putting it
away.
The second half was end-to-
end stuff, with some fine
goal-keeping by Roger Hutson
that kept the opposition out i n
the frantic last ten minutes.

Fresher gains
On Wednesday 13th October,
the Orienteering C l u b travelled
to Richmond Park for a s m a l l
beginners' event. T h e long
course o f 7 Vi Kilometres
attracted only a f e w entrants
as most people preferred the
shorter version.
Fresher success
Andy Q u t c k f a l l and Mark
E v a n s , both freshers, d i d w e l l
to complete the long course i n
53mins 20secs and 66mins
l O s e c s respectively. A n d y
i s a very welcome addition
to the IC Orienteering s c e n e ,
as he has been orienteering
for several years now.
Cheating rules OK!
On the short course, K e i t h
Sugden w a s the easy winner,
five minutes clear of F r a n c e s
L u m b from R o y a l H o l l o w a y .
T h e rest of the IC contingent
formed a loose bunch b y about
half w a y round the course a n d
were rarely out of sight of one
another. T h i s slightly defeated
the object of the course — for
once one person found a contr61
point, the rest a l l p i l e d i n after
him. N e v e r t h e l e s s , it w a s
very pleasing to see everyone
finishing the course in under
an hour, and it looks a s though
U E c l u b h a s gained quite a
number of talented freshers
this year.
