12 - FELIX, O C T O B E R 21 MI.
THE LSO DEBATE
At a forthcoming UGM IC Union will decide w
h
e
t
h
e
r to remain within the London Students Organisation. To help
elucidate the debate FELIX asked H
u
g
h Barrett and Trevor Phillips to present the pros & cons of staying in LSO.
There are several good
reasons for not re-affiliating
to the London Students
Organisation and I w i l l briefly
run through a few of the more
important ones:
Finance
The main reason i s purely
financial — Imperial C o l l e g e
Union i s in a very tight
financial position after having
its grant from the Governers
increased by only 10% last
year — which represents a
decfease in real money terms.
ICU has thus been forced to
reduce s u b s i d i e s and, in some
c a s e s , curtail activities
• completely.
ICU is due to pay £500
•3 to L S O this year in affiliation
fees; that might not seem an
e x c e s s i v e amount when set
against £80,000 - I C U ' s income
from the Governors — but a
large percentage the U n i o n ' s
grant goes on fixed expenditure
such as maintainance of union
areas, sabbatical and office
staff salaries etc, s o the £500
is reducing the activity of the
union by a substantial amount
— it would for example keep
F E L I X going for half a year
or take 100 sports people out
to Harlington and back every
Saturday for a term.
it doesn't cost us anything a s
a union. U L U Students
Representative C o u n c i l is the
P o l i t i c a l side of U L U and
perfectly able to run campaigns
on issues that effect a l l
the colleges within the
University.
How about at National
level - isn't that what NUS
is for? We a l l ready pay £400
to NUS every year and one of
the things we expect (and get)
in return are national campaigns
on national i s s u e s such as
student grants, housing,
overseas students etc.
Sabbatical career prospects
Ffhally one of the main
criticisms leveled at L S O over
the past two years is that it
provides a comfortable
sabbatical year for an up and
coming N U S p o l i t i c o . Last
year it w a s John Webster
(ex-NUS vice-president) and
this year i t ' s our very own
Trevor P h i l l i p s (ex-ICU
sabbatical President, e x -
U L U sabbatical President,
present L S O sabbatical
secretary, next year N U S
sabbatical ? F i l l in your
answer and send it on a post-
card to: Broad Left c / o N U S ,
Endsleigh S t ) . T h e one
argument in favour of L S O that
We're already in the
cheaper alternatives,
so why bother
with LSO
So w e pay £500 of our
increasingly s c a r c e cash to
LSO every year and what do we
get in return?
ULU cheaper and
m
o
r
e effective
We are supposed to get
campaigns run on a local
basis but, a s far a s I can s e e , .
LSO is failing in this job and
I'm not the only one who feels
this way. T o quote P e t e P h i l l i p s
(no relation) w h o w a s last
years L S O Western Area
Convener '...the sheer size of
LSO itself prevents any real
local action...' So even a L S O
officer agrees that L S O is not
providing any significant
campaigns at a local level —
campaigns which could be run
just a s e a s i l y and mudh more
efficiently by a large college
such a s I C . With L S O failing
to provide real local a c t i o n '
what about an a l l - L o n d o n
•level?As far as I C is concerned
a well established and fairly
well run organisation already
exists - the University of
London Union ( U L U ) . T h i s
has the added advantage that
I have any time for is that it
enables small c o l l e g e s to share
in the resources of larger
c o l l e g e s . T h i s is a good point
but I feel that it is better
organised on a far more local
— for us S Kensington area —
and informal b a s i s . .

IC UNION GENERAL
MEETING
GREAT HALL
Thurs. 2nd Dec. 1pm
The Editor welcomes
correspondence on
this topic
LSO-the reasons
why ICU needs
to stay in
There are two questions
to be answered in this brief
article. F i r s t l y , what is the
London Students' Organisation?
Secondly, what c a n it do for
students?
Take the first question first.
Over the past few years, it has
been widely- recognised that
N U S , a s a national body of
700,000 students could not
hope to handle a l l the issues
that affected students locally,
or of organising campaigns or
services locally, thus the
54 N U S areas, based on towns
and counties developed,
should provide a smaller,
local focus for students.
First year of existence
L S O i s the area organisation
recognized by (but independant
of) N U S National Conference.
There are over 160 colleges in
London, and last year, in its
first year of existence, about
105 joined L S O . The ones who
did .not were mainly small
c o l l e g e s with no function in
Unions, to which L S O is
extending services anyway.
A few others wanted to wait and
see what .happened to L S O . This
year some have already joined
(Kingston Polytechnic for
instance) and others are on the
verge of doing so."
Need for all-round London b
o
d
y
For some years, it has
been widely recognised that
London students c o l l e c t i v e l y
can have a massive influence
on N U S , and on localeducational
.bodies. There are 120,000
full-time students in London,
and a quarter of a million
part-times. However, beyond
U L U , U L I E S A (the student
teachers organisation), there
was no all-London body.
Previous attempts had failed
either because they were
unco-ordinated, or e l s e built
up bureaucratic structures
with no relation to student
needs, and provided havens
for aging Student Union h a c k s .
U L U ' and U L I E S A were
limited in their roles. So 2
years ago . the process of
building the L S O was started,
and the L S O itself carfte into
being in May 1975.
Since then L S O has begun
to develop the kind of
organisation that c a n defend,
in advance, students' interests.
With the weight of London's
massive concentration of
students, the largest in
Europe, we can hope to have
an influence on questions of
grants, housing, welfare and
s e r v i c e s for students.
W
h
a
t LSO does
L S O itself has provided
information and research
material on many of the i s s u e s
affecting students: cuts, over-
seas students, and the riousing
manual, for instance. Posters
and broadsheets have been
produced. Last year, plans
to cut the number of overseas
students in London were
defeated by campaign c o -
ordinating by the L S O . Not
least, L S O has been responsible
for producing the new London
Student Handbook.
In s e r v i c e s , L S O , is hoping
to convene meetings for
welfare, entertainments and
sports officers to exchange
information, ideas and to
develop the effectiveness of
local Student Union Officers,
roles and s e r v i c e s .
Representation
In terrps of campaigning,
we are .now seeking to gain
representation on educational
bodies in London, and are on
the verge of a breakthrough
with the largest, the Inner
London Education Authority.
W
h
y ICU needs LSO
The L S O operates largely
through its sub areas. Imperial
falls in the west area in which
context it c a n play a role in
relating L S O ' s activities even
more directly to the needs of
I C ' s students. It c a n also
help in the vital task of
bui.lding smaller and weaker
Student Unions in the locality.
Most Students Unions in
London have recognized the
importance of uniting and
working together for the good
of students. N o Student Union
in London can afford to stand
outside this process. The way
that L S O works, campaigns and
provides s e r v i c e s is for those
Unions to decide through the
L S O conference — but they
must take part in d e c i s i o n -
making if they are to do their
jobs. A s an ex-member of
ICU I hope that IC's students
accept trie responsibility and
take the d e c i s i o n to play an
active part in the London
Students Organisation.
