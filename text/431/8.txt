Worth seeing again
First things first — the support band.
They were called Blue A n g e l . Within
the confines of their setup — black
guitarist with left-handed stratocaster,
playing in a Hendrix Experience type
power trio — they were reasonable.
They were very loud, of course. T h e
audience applauded.
By half past nine the Hall began to
look pretty full, and I began to wonder
why. Graham Parker and h i s band have
been getting considerable coverage in
the music press recently, but do people
really take any notice of that? However,
as soon a s the band embarked upon their
first number, a l l such doubts were swept
away on a tide of superb good-time rock.
Good time for all
The sound w a s clear, powerful, and
very pleasant — a little loud perhaps,
but I wouldn't have had it any other way.
The band were confident, exhuberant,
and enjoyed every minute of the gig, a s
did the audience. T h e Rumour have a
great a s s e t in guitarist Brinsley Schwarz,
whose own band, of that name, had a
similar sort of good time rock and roll
feel t o that of the Rumour, but the
latter w i n hands down on v i t a l i t y ,
freshness, and energy.
Graham Parker's excellent vocals
presented a fitting contrast to the
band, giving a rough edge to the sound.
They played about thirteen songs in a l l ,
including their new single 'Hotel Chamber-
maid'. The most notable of these songs
was 'Pouring it all out', from their
forthcoming album, a magnificent song,
with a superb hook-line.
Early risers
T h i s w a s followed by 'Back to
Schooldays', a powerful rocker which
had the whole crowd on their feet by the
time it was over — only halfway through
the set! A l s o of note was the lament-like
'Don't Ask Me Questions', and then 'Heat
Treatment', the title track of their
forthcoming album. The s e t closed with
another neat rocker, 'Soul Shoes', from
the 'Howlin' Wind' album.
Live vs Vinyl
A s with many bands of this type, one
must always wonder if they c a n match
the live performance on record. I reckon
the new album w i l l be worth a listen to
find out!
The evening finished with two w e l l -
deserved encores from the band, w h o
by then had the audience begging for
more. Y e s , it was certainly an enjoyable
g i g . Y o u can s t i l l catch them at the New
Victoria this month - d o yourself a
favour and see them.
