TI30 £19-95
Rugged. Economical. With powerful capability found on
professional models costing much more. So it will continue to
serve you through your student days and into your career.
Its great advantage is A O S . TI's unique algebraic
operating system. Key-in problems left-to-right. For example:
2+3x(4+(V+9)=42.736111.
You can handle as many as 15 sets of parentheses. There
are 48 functions. A n 8-digit display, including scientific
notation. Overload or make a mistake and the display reads
error. Should you leave it on, no problem. The Ti-30 turns
itself off.
Finally, it operates on a 9-volt battery. There's also an
optional kit available to make your TI-30 fully rechargeable.

SR51TI
£59-95
A n exceptionally powerful
professional calculator
combining T F s unique
Algebraic Operating System
(AOS) with 9 levels of
parentheses and 22 basic slide
rule functions. Additionally the
SR-51-II has several
preprogrammed statistical
functions including mean,
variance, standard deviation
and factorials for permutation
problems. Correlation
coefficient is made possible
with a separate key and
advanced linear regression
analysis can be calculated
through an independent set of
registers. A n 8+2 L E D display
has fixed or floating point with scientific and engineering
notation formats. Calculations are performed to 12- digit
accuracy and rounded for display.The SR-51-II offers you 3
independent memories and 7 preprogrammed conversions.
SR56
£69-95
A n easy to use key
programmable, the SR-56
handles 74 preprogrammed
operations, including trig,
logs, conversions, and
statistics, as well as TI's
unique A O S system. A n d the
SR-56 can be programmed.
Lengthy, time-consuming
repetitive problems can
become a thing of the past.
While the result of your
Erogramming skill can lead to
etter decision-making.
Solution sequences can
be entered into programme
memory once. Then recalled
as often as needed. Four
logical decision functions, two
loop-control instructions and four subroutine levels let you
branch to programme segments automatically.
A n Applications Library is also included. So you can
begin to programme right away.
