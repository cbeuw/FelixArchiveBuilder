Punk Rock exposed
With the news last week that the Sex Pistols have just
signed a contract with E M I , that includes the largest advance
ever paid to a relatively unknown group (rumoured to be around
£40,000 — that's almost twice a s much a s Oueen were given, and
look where they are now) I think i t ' s worth taking a quick look
at this phenomenon that h a s built up over the last twelve
months which has come to be c a l l e d 'punk rock.'. F o r a start,
'the new w a v e ' , as it has come to be c a l l e d , is s o far s o l e l y
confined to the London area, disregarding groups like the
Feelgood and Hot Rods w h o , no matter what people tell y o u ,
are a different bag of balls altogether, than ? a y the Strang lers,
Clash or even the Pistols. Whereas bands like my favourite
punksters the Stranglers for instance, have no trouble f i l l i n g
reasonable s i z e d h a l l s i n London — i n the provinces they are
alniiisi loially unknown and to a greater extent misunderstood.
Vibrators sell out in Forty minutes
Take last week for instance, 1 w a s present on Sunday night
when the Stranglers together with the Vibrators, completely
sold out the N a s h v i l l e , London's best pub g i g . People were
queuing for a. good hour to get in the joint, and within forty
minutes of opening, the 'House F u l l ' signs were up, A l s o
just about every ligger around was out to catch the band, from
Johnny Rotten of the P i s t o l s , most of the Hot Rods and even
Ray Davies to name but a f e w .
Now its two days later. T h e stage has changed from the
riotous triumph of West Kensington to the T o p Rank Suite i n
C a r d i l L A n abysmal crowd who don't really know quite what
to make of the band i n front of them, who must seem (to the
crowd) to have just crawled out of a sewer. A s the Stranglers go
further into their set, with its brilliant D o o r / V . Underground
observations, the inevitable cat c a l l s get louder. T h i s is not
helped.by the equipment problems that beset the band on almost
every gig (unbelievably, although the P A is quite modern,
some of the amps date back to pre V o x 67 ' s ) . T h e Stranglers
limp off to l i c k their wounds, no doubt thinking about next
week's two s e l l out gigs at Hammersmith Odean with Patti
Smith
Or take the Sex Pistols, they're bigger than any of the new
wave in London.'It's no good going to a P i s t o l s to queue for a
couple of hours before the doors are opened. Three weeks a g o
they played the unlikely Stow A w a y C l u b in Newport, Gwent, a
sort of over 21s nightclub, where 'gentlemen' must wear ajacket
at a l l times and jeans are a no-go.

Among the army of bouncers the club employ, the Stow
Away boasts two of the infamous 'Pontypool front-row', who
form part of the Welsh rugby team. Can you imagine the response
the P i s t o l s got when they played numbers like Anarchy in the
I K' '
The fallacy music papers perpetrate
So while the three bin niusu w e e k l i e s laud their praise o n
these bands, and record companies make the inevitable rush to
sign any group of degenerates who happen to know two chords
and sniff glue, it's worth remembering that the so c a l l e d 'new
wave' is only but a small ripple confined to London, with no
real signs that it w i l l spread to any great degree, a n d it is not
the most revolutionary thing to happen since the other revolution,
as those misinformed scribes of 'Sounds' would have us b e l i e v e .
Apart from the P a t t i Smith/Stranglers gig this weekend, if
you'd like to sample some of the new bainds playing this week
then I suggest the I C A off the M a l l on Saturday night where
the Clash, Subway Sect and Snatch Sound can be heard. O n
Thursday the Dammned play at the R e d C o w in Hammersmith
R o a d , and also support Graham Parker and the Rumour at New
V i c t o r i a on Tuesday,
