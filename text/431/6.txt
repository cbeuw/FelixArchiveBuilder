THE BENEFITS OF THE NATIONAL STUDENT
For the last umpteen years the National Union of
Students has been fighting for higher student grants. Their
indifferent s u c c e s s here has led them to investigate.other
ways of extending your grant.
Hence the National Discount Scheme which, amid the
usual mass of publicity, made i t s entrance less than two
months ago. Once you have purchased the discount card
you are entitled to the full range of discounts listed in the
accompanying handbook (which comes with the £ 2 you pay
for the card). T h e s e usually amount to 10% and d o not
normally apply to items which have already been reduced
by the retailer.
Being the first year of operation N U S Marketing h a s
not secured too many discounts. T h e scheme i s heavily
reliant on the Countdown discount card, printed on the
student discount card, and its discounts. Considering the
Countdown card usually c o s t s £ 7 . 5 0 , i t s addition to NSDS
is a great boom.
F E L I X has tried to list the range of discounts available
in and around IC. Discounts available in C h e l s e a , E a r l s
Court and Knightsbridge are a l s o listed. T h i s guide i s
certainly not exclusive and retailers or restaurants outside
the student budget have been deliberately excluded.
Full details of a l l discounts are available in the NSDS
Handbook. F E L I X i s indebted to N U S , N U S Marketing and
Countdown for permission to publish this guide.
Discount is 10% on all
products at the retailers
listed unless otherwise
stated.
