Hypocrisy or
blind faith?
12 October 1976
Dear Sir, — Just as the question
of abortion should, I b e l i e v e ,
be left a s a matter between
the woman and her p h y s i c i a n , s o
the questions relating to
foreign affairs such a s the
situations in R h o d e s i a , South
A f r i c a etc should be left as a
matter between the individual
and h i s / h e r M P . After a l l ,
p o l i t i c i a n s in this country
are elected democratically
(despite the need for electoral
reform) and they span the whole
p o l i t i c a l spectrum from L e f t to
R i g h t . T h e p o l i t i c i a n s are
in a far better position than
any I C student to adopt a
global perspective on foreign
affairs — so let us leave it up
to them for a change. F o r an
IC Union Meeting to adopt a
positive stance on a particular
foreign issue may appear very
grandiose. But I consider it
to be irrelevant.
So the questions of R h o d e s i a
and South A f r i c a are important,
I agree. A n d I c a n read a l l
about them in the national
press thank you very much,
international issues are
important, but d i s c u s s i o n of
them at an I C Union Meeting is
not!!
Another thing is this: when
Soc Soc scurry about c a l l i n g a
recent U G M amendment
' v i c i o u s ' , the intemperance of
their language cuts them off
from a large majority of I C
students. That is a pity,
because S o c Soc o c c a s i o n a l l y
has things to s a y w h i c h ought
to have a wider hearing.
And when attending U G M ' s
I would prefer not to see Soc
Soc playing p o l i t i c a l charades.
I believe they are dabbling
i n something about w h i c h they
do not know enough. That is a
dangerous practice which
starkly silhouettes Soc Soc as
a group of well-intentioned
but naive dilettantes.
One of Soc S o c ' s warhorses
i s the altitude that r a c i s t s
and f a s c i s t s must be 'stamped
out'. Such manifest intolerance
and implicit violence practically
puts them in the same category
as r a c i s t s and f a s c i s t s and
again it cuts them off from the
large majority of I C students.
Trying to 'stamp out' any
minority group, however
loathsome and repulsive they
are, c a n only lead to entrenched
r e s i s t a n c e , or alternatively,
driving the fascits underground,
I prefer to identify my opponents,
not have them creep up behind
me.
Thus the principles are
on the whole sound, the
t a c t i c s absurd.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir, — A mistake crept
into the article about Nightline
in your last edition of F E L I X .
The word a d v i c e was mentioned
in the headline of this article
and advice is one of the things
that Nightline volunteers are
unable to g i v e ,
Nightline volunteers are
ordinary students who give
some of their time to Nightline.
Y o u could not expect of any of
them that they are experts
e s p e c i a l l y not on the wide
range of problems we come
across i n N i g h t l i n e . If y o u
need advice there are many
professional people who
co.uld do that a lot better than
any volunteer worker, and if
you want to Nightline can give
you their address or even put
you i n contact with them.
What a Nightline volunteer
can do i s l i s t e n to y o u and try
to understand that which i s
bothering y o u with a n open
mind.
I hope that cleared up the
picture.
i y o u r s sincerely
A Nightline volunteer

" T h e IC Operatic S o c i e t y ' s
next college production w i l l
be J Offenbach's 'Orpheus in
the Underworld'. T h e society
d i s p l a y s a sense of adventure
in this c h o i c e , for two reasons;
firstly, 'Orpheus' marks a
departure from a strong Gilbert
and Sullivan tradition. (This
production w i l l mark the
fifteenth years since the last
non-G&S production). Secondly,
as there i s no suitable english
translation a v a i l a b l e the
society is translating its own
version from the original
i french libretto.
] Popularity
J ' U t o p i a Limited' was our
last production and there w a s
i much speculation a s to its
j lack of popularity among
operatic s o c i e t i e s today. (Since
then the D'Oyly Carte record-
ing has come onto the market).!
i 'Orpheus' seems to lack
popularity to a s i m i l a r degree,
for the english version
' available is not a translation,
i but a rather inadequate re-
' write,
I Anyone having seen an
i amateur production of 'Orpheus'
i w i l l probably have seen this
! version and w i l l almost
i certainly that Offenbach's
;
music deserves a better
I companion. A l s o there is no
i recording of a full english
i version on the market. T h e
I E n g l i s h National Opera and
j more recently the Welsh
: National Opera have produced
their own translations, but
these are not a v a i l a b l e to u s .
i Wife bored
T h i s comic opera is set in
i ancient Greece, where Orpheus,
the legendary master-musician
: i s seen as the incompetent
; director of the Thebes C o n -
| servatoire of m u s i c . H e is a
professional fiddler who bores
his wife, E u r y d i c e , to the
extent that she flings herself
into an affair with P l u t o , while
in the Underworld Jupiter
dances a minuet that develops
into a can-can of the gods.
