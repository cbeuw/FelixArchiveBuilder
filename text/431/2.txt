P G Affairs Officer Rick Parker casts his views on the Government's recent White Paper on P G education
After all the hoo-ha 'disturbing' Govt,
report advocates the status quo
In August we saw the addition of yet
another report on Postgraduate E d u c a t i o n /
Training added to the mounting flood
initiated by the Parliamentary Expenditure
Committee report of 1973—74. T h i s
particular report w a s the Government's
long awaited formal response to the'
original report, taking the form Of a
White Paper. On the outset it seems very
promissing; gone are the demands for
loan financed postgraduate funding (for
the time being); gone are the demands
of previous reports for central funding
and control of postgraduate training; gone
are the assertions that manpower planning
should be the sole governing factor (now
relegated to being merely the overriding
factor).
However, on removing a l l this, one
is merely left with a tacit advocation of
the status quo with a f e w unsavoury
overtones.
Apprenticeship to a career
in scholarship
The paper does recognise that personal
satisfaction and the contribution made
by research students to the advancement
ICWA
We are now over our first major hurdle
of the term — the Annual Freshers
D'nner. Despite the long delay — the
port had gone astray — the meal went
down very w e l l (pun!!). A l l in a l l people
seemed to enjoy the whole evening.
Many thanks to a l l who helped in any
way to make the whole evening s o
s u c c e s s f u l .
Discos
On Sat 30th O c t there shouid be the
first in the series of ICWA D i s c o s . T h e
d i s c o w i l l be held in the Union from
8pm — midnight and entrance is F R E E .
Thereafter every second Saturday there
w i l l be a d i s c o but. the charge w i l l be a
mere 10p.
Practical matters
Now for a few practical details about
ICWA. We are the proud owner of three
sewing machines. T h e s e can be borrowed
by any young lady for a nominal s u m
for anything up to two w e e k s . If the
machine takes longer to return home then
there is a fine imposed. So if you want to
mend your jeans or start your dress for
the ICWA B a l l then you can borrow one
of the machines from Rm 98 Beit H a l l .
A l s o if y o u live in Beit then you c a n
borrow a hairdryer. T h e only condition
on borrowing this is that it is returned
the same day — hence it really only
applies to people i n residence.1

Now that you know what ICWA c a n d o
for you, why don't you d o something for
ICWA. In the near future nomination
papers w i l l be going up for the posts of
Hon S e c , Treasurer, E n t s Officer,
Biology R e p and Mines R e p . If you are
Interested in helping or c r i t i c i z i n g in
any way then please stand for one of
these posts. The only way w e know what
you want done is if you tell us and this
is your chance.

of knowledge, are important factors.
Further more it r e c o g n i s e s , that • an
exact fit to the s o c i a l and economic
demands of the society are impossible
and that we must settle for a very 'loose
fit'. However it goes on to s a y that a
system designed for individual demands
would be a very haphazard way of
satisfying manpower needs. A t last,
thankfully, the Government recognises
that a P h D i s not a piece of abstract
research, but i s , ' a n apprenticeship to a
future career in s c h o l a r s h i p ' , and notes
the application of this to a wide variety
of future v o c a t i o n s .
The Government apparantly believes
that the content and balance of P G
training are too complex for central
control, and is content to exercise
such control only over the overall scale
and development.
Finance: Central control out
On the finance side again, central
control is out, but the awardmaking
bodies should control both the numbers
and distribution of P G s throughout the
subject range. It i s apparant that the
Government i s seeking to increase its
control, through these bodies, by ensuring
that more P G s are dependant on them for
funding. T h e recent and proposed fee
increases are shown to be just one small
part of this plan and are shown clearly
from the report to be an attack on the
T h i s w e e k ' s article is supposed to be
a short summary of the political groups
within student p o l i t i c s , but | must stress
that it is only a personal view and may
appear to some of you to be biased and
inaccurate - if you d o feel this way let
the editor know, h e ' s desperate for
controversy.
Starting from the left we have the
revolutionary s o c i a l i s t parties such a s
the International Marxist Group (IMG) and
the Workers Revolutionary Party (WRP).
These groups are e s s e n t i a l l y revolution-
ary but each preach their own particular
brand of revolution. The W R P i s a very
interesting party, their obsession i s to
overthrow the Labour Government (no
alternative stated); this theme occurs s o
often in their s p e e c h e s that it has been
suggested frivolously that they are
financed by the Tory party.. A l l these
groups are small but consist of very
active members, s o that they often
attract a disproportionate amount of
attention.
Moving to the right we come to a very
large, in terms of N U S conference
delegates the second largest group, and
well organised group — the International
Socialists organised into the National
Organisation ot International Socialist
Societies, abbreviated to NOISS (pro-
nounced noise). They are a b a s i c a l l y
Trotskyite party, that i s ner>cpmmunist
and have very strong support in many
P o l y t e c h n i c s (except Strand).
Slightly to the right again are I C U ' s
'bete noir' the Broad Left — a mixture of
Communist, leftwing Labour and n o n -
13.5% of P G s at present self-financed.
There are a l s o vague references to a
change in structure of P G awards a s a
further step in increasing this control.
The present Research C o u n c i l funding
scheme i s upheld for the time being on
the grounds of minimising bureaucracy.
On the whole the report is disappointing
and possibly dangerous in its support
for the increased fees and the status quo
in P G E d u c a t i o n . T h e recommendations
are inane and innocuous but the undertones
in the body of the report are disturbing. It
is hoped that the N U S ' s own report on P G
education w i l l contribute to what the
Whitepaper c a l l s , 'far-reaching public
debate' ,both by countering these undertones
and by making some positive and con-
structive suggestions for the P G of
tomorrow rather than leaving him to s i n k
further into the present bog of beurocracy.

aligned s o c i a l i s t s who have for the last
eight years or s o , dominated national
student p o l i t i c s to the almost total
exclusion of any other political grouping.
The backbone of the Broad Left both in
ideology and in finance is the Communist
Party.
To the right of the Broad Left one
encounters a virtual vacuum of political
parties until you reach the C o n s e r v a t i v e s ,
which i s a strange situation since a very
large percentage of- students have
political beliefs which correspond to
middle of the road Labour to L i b e r a l .
Their are three small parties in this .
space, firstly the Union of Liberal
Students a group which i s very much to
the left of the Parliamentary party and
consequently i s in a state of political
bankruptcy. There are a l s o the Students
for Representative Policies, a small party
dedicated to changing the structure of the
NUS and bringing in more representative
p o l i c i e s . Despite i t ' s small s i z e it i s
well financed and well p u b l i c i s e d .
Similar in aims but even smaller i s the
Social Democratic Party.
Finalfy we come to the Federation Of
Conservative Students (FCS) - politically
slightly more moderate than the Tory
party but s i n c e they are financed by it,
still in agreement with most of their
p o l i c i e s . T h e F C S i s the third largest
group at NUS conference after the Broad
Left and NOISS. It has grown from very
small beginnings to i t s present s i z e in
the last couple of years — its main areas
of support are the big U n i v e r s i t i e s .
