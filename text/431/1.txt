Tuition fee increase worries Rector
Rector rejects Green
Shield stamp idea
Student
numbers
up
At a Board of Studies meeting
on Wednesday it was revealed
that undergraduate admissions
to IC are up by over ten per
cent on last year's figures,
bringing the (provisional)
total numbers i n the college
from 4100 to approximately
4250. A consistent boom in
admissions over the past two
years has reduced the per-
centage by which intake f a l l s
short of target levels from
14% to a mere 1%.
T h e increase reflects a
nationwide rise of 4.6%
estimated by U C C A — i n other
words 3,500 more university
students throughout B r i t a i n .
And even this increase i s
small compared to the 8 . 7 %
increase in applications from
school-leavers, undetered by
fears of graduate unemployment.

In general the admissions
increase is not thought to
represent a lowering of
standards, and it is likely to
be felt mostly in scientific
and engineering departments,
according to a T H E S report
last F r i d a y . A n even greater
increase in admissions has
occurred at polytechnics with
a 20% rise at Sunderland, and
this is in spite of government
cut-backs on teacher-training.
U n i v e r s i t i e s chiefly affected
are Bradford, Birmingham,
Stirling, C i t y , H u l l , Manchester
and Southampton.

THE RECTOR, Sir Brian Flowers, last Thursday warned
of the dangers of Government impr-adtuition fee increases,.
In his Commemoration day adcir. tie foresaw this producing
a dramatic drop in university applications, such that
Registrars might offer 10-fold Green Shield stamps on
completion of a registration form. He hoped that IC would
avoid this era of promotion gimmicks. 'A panic scramble
for students' was, thought, a real possibility said the
Rector.
Already the Government has
forced universities to increase
their tuition fees, whilst at
the same time decreasing the
money a v a i l a b l e to them from
the University Grants Committee.
The Rector believes that an
increasing proportion of
college finance w i l l therefore
have to come from tuition f e e s .
However he did not make
clear i n h i s speech how a drop
in student numbers would be
spread between home and
overseas students.
Jobs in jeopardy
T h e U G C grant to universities
for 1977—8 has already been cut
by 4% compared to this year's
amount. However, some
observers believe that the
U G C cuts i n real terms w i l l
be around 1 0 % and that a
cutback of this magnitude
would inevitably lead to
redundancies. Some campus
unions even voice the view
that a real cut of 4% would
put some jobs in jeapordy at
IC.
Huddie report
Nevertheless the Rector
thought that Imperial C o l l e g e ,
as a science and technology
centre, would be less affected
than most by the increased
tuition f e e s . If not in a position
to expand, there were plans to
broaden the scope of c o u r s e s .
Sir D a v i d Huddie's report, on
the non-technological academic
development of I C , recommends
that several new subjects and
new combinations of e x i s t i n g
courses be offered. T h e
C o l l e g e intends to e s t a b l i s h
a new chair in Economics and
develop activities in Industrial
P s y c h o l o g y . T h e s e p l a n s ,
though, may well be tempered
by present economic factors
said the Rector.
Although post graduate
courses are l o s i n g popularity,
there, was an increase i n
undergraduate applications (see
'Student numbers up', this
page). .Over '6,000 were
received.^ over a thousand being
admitted; this i s the highest
number for ten years. The
Rector went on to welcome
the recent White Paper on P G
education (see page 2).
His speech w a s i n the
'spirit of optimism', and Sir
Brian hoped that in the future
IC would produce students
with a much broader outlook.
Overall he felt that academic
standards at I C were a s high
as ever.
Individual initiatives
T a l k i n g about a notable
non-academic achievement he
saifi, 'With generous financial
support, a broad combination
of Imperial College talent came
together to produce a revol-
utionary design aimed at
stiffness and lightness'. He
was of course referring to the
new boat designed by the
Lubrication Laboratory that
was to have been used i n the
Montreal O l y m p i c s .

Late Felix
