press cuts
A few words of explanation over last
week's non-appearance of Pres Cuttings;
N i c k d i d submit an article, but late. 'If
you don't have space' he s a i d , 'don't
print i t ' . We didn't have space. However
my apologies to N i c k for not saying such
in the editorial; I w a s knackered —I'd
had l e s s than twelve hours sleep in fifty
hours when I came to write the editorial
...Most of the F E L I X staff were l i k e w i s e ,
which accounts also for any other
mistakes i n last w e e k ' s F E L I X .

Sir B r i a n ' s speech yesterday was a good
(Jeal milder than his last three. Commemor-
ation day addresses; indeed he even pat-
ted the Government on the back at some
points. Yet he, C o l l e g e and student leaders
alike are only too aware of the economic
problems that this C o l l e g e w i l l face in the
coming years.
There i s a general feeling'that i n real
terms IC w i l l be somewhere in the region
of 10% worse off than it i s now in 1977-8.
The C o l l e g e has already cut i t s budget &
at last year's Commemoration day the R e c
tor indicated that IC, like other universit-
es w a s " c l o s e to breaking p o i n t " . Old
B o y s day i s hardly the time to paint a
gloomy picture, so we shall have to wait
to see whether union predictions of across
the board redundancies are accurate.
Linstead extension
L a s t week a Southside warden compared
the new L i n s t e a d H a l l extension to a
'rabbit warren' with no extra communual
area and no extra entrance. T h e same
warden later admitted that he had not
seen the detailed plans and that h i s
remarks were somewhat partisanly aimed
at his own residents.
Nevertheless h i s remarks, a l l be they
flippant; do highlight the general ignorance
and lack of college d i s c u s s i o n on the
new extension. C o l l e g e and Student Union
leaders have thrashed out the plans for
the building and are i n the process of
applying for planning permission. That
could be granted next Thursday; yet how
much do hall residents and college
employees know about the scheme — I
believe very little.
Although late in the day F E L I X intends
looking at the C o l l e g e proposals and at
those put forward by the l o c a l residents
a s s o c i a t i o n . We shall be asking what
hall students wardens and others think
of both proposals, and are there any
better ideas? Correspondence about the
new extension would thus be welcomed.

Open a credit account with London Transport
F A R E D E A L : N o t a way of
getting out of paying tube
fares, but a simple a n d legal
way of making London Trans-
port's bureaucracy work to
c o l l e c t your fare.
The Fare Fight group is
made up of both passengers
and transport staff who use
direct action i n the form o f a
deffered payment s l i p . T h i s
device a l l o w s you to buy a lOp
ticket (You must have a ticket,
it i s illegal without one) and
f i l l out the s l i p for the balance
of the 'offical fare'.
The onus is then on London
Transport to collect this
balance off y o u . T h e group
hope these tactics w i l l pressure
the authorities into providing
a better service and lower
fares, with the service being
orientated towards the user
making e x c e s s student appeal
rather than
profits.
T h e present p o l i c y of
London Transport of higher
fares and reduced s e r v i c e s i s ,
according to a Fare Fight
spokesman doing more damage
to the transport system than
Fare F i g h t s tactics. (There
have just been cuts On the
Central line a n d ones are
planned for the Bakerloo).

outstanding sum, my name and address is:

Signed.
It is quite simple to use Deferred Payment Slips
like the one printed here. Simply buy a ticket
for less than the "official" fare - - whatever you
think is reasonable. Present i t at the other end,
together with a completed slip (you may need to show
some identification). Then i t ' s up to LT to chase you
for the extra money. It is illegal to get on a train
with no ticket, so get at least a lOp one. Full
details are on the FARE FIGHT leaflet "Dragging It
Out" which is available free with books of 24 slips
(2p per book, plus p&p) from FARE FIGHT, Flat 3,
76 Sidney Street, London E.l. (790 9965).
Fare F i g h t ' s aims have
obvious" appeal to students
who have c a s h - f l o w problems
because they are only able to
c l a i m back expenses at the
end of term. L e t s face it
the" student grant i s fine, if
you don't eat. .
Fare Fight meet at ' R i s i n g
Free B o o k s h o p ' , 138 Drummond
St (near E u s t o n station).
Anyone interested i n participat-
ing i n more involved direct
action i s welcome. T h e y
campaign on a wide front and a
great variety of people are
