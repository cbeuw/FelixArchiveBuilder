Why Everybody’s Talking about Jamie and Aladdin,
Whether you’re an ardent theatre lover or a hardened
sceptic, there’s likely something for everyone to enjoy
in our cultural city. In this guide to the West End, Arts
Writer Eamon Akil Farhat gives us a flavour of what’s
on at the moment, and why it might be even better
value than we previously thought...
W
hen it comes
to theatre,
L o n d o n
is an
international capital of
excellence. Some would
argue it offers the best of
the best when it comes
to high quality cultural
performances. While
many have fallen under
the spell of the big musi-
cals and gripping plays,
always yearning for their
next chance to get their
West End fix, others don’t
see the hype, thinking it
tacky, overpriced and “not
for me”. Breaking down
these stereotypes and
showing that there truly is
something for everyone is
important to ensure this art
form remains accessible
to all. What better way to
do this than by exploring
four very different, hugely
successful musicals that
you can go and see today
on the West End?
find yourself in the seat
of an iconic West End
musical. Though movies
have their charm, there
is something very special
about seeing a perfor-
mance live. Familiar
songs are belted out right
in front of your eyes – no
lip-syncing here! – and the
sheer number of people is
stupendous, from actors
and the live band, to
lighting technicians and
even the understudies,
ensuring that the show
goes on every night. To
add to the drama of it all,
the beautiful old theatres
in which the performance
take place will make you
feel like you’re a member
of the bourgeoisie, even if
you only paid a tenner for
your ticket! Here are four
very different musicals
to give you a flavour for
what’s on...
magical genie and marry
a beautiful princess. The
plot is hardly the raison
d’etre for this production,
but it definitely has other
strengths.
The opening of the per-
formance is underwhelm-
ing. Despite an innovative
set, with swivelling
housing and minarets,
these first scenes fail to
capture the essence of
the hustle and bustle of
the market scene from
the movie. However, the
genie, played by Trevor
Dion Nicholas from the
original Broadway cast,
saves the day with an
electric performance of
‘Friend Like Me’. Provid-
ing high-energy comedic
relief, he drops in refer-
ences to everything from
Wakanda, Beauty and the
Beast, and of course the
Christina Aguilera classic,
‘Genie in a Bottle’.
The sets, costume and
choreography are the forte
of this show. During a
couple of songs, no less
than ten costume changes
could be counted! With a
backdrop dripping with
gold, actors parade in
dressed like Vegas show-
girls, before reappearing
moments later as tap
dancers straight out of
42nd
Street. In the palace,
the geometric Islamic art-
styled walls add a level of
elegance and simplicity to
a show that at times seem
a little ostentatious. To top
it all off, the magic carpet
flying through an enchant-
ing starry sky leaves the
entire audience in awe.
The only downside of this
magical moment is that
the carpet rather steals the
show, leaving the greatly
anticipated ‘A Whole
New World’ something of
an afterthought.
is very different – and yet
it instantly feels like a
classic. The central ques-
tion – “Are people born
wicked or do they have
wickedness thrust upon
them?” – is explored with
a clear moral argument
organically emerging in
a way that doesn’t feel
forced in the slightest.
it is brought to life on the
West End stage by Alice
Fearn who takes it to new
heights. This song comes
at such a climatic point, it
makes Everest look like
a mere hill and, without
wanting to give away too
much, a certain greenified
witch might just defy
gravity (just a little)!
Being a faraway land
– outside Zone 2 most
probably – Oz must live
up to its weird and won-
derful credentials. During
a little weekend trip to the
Emerald City, the locals
are dressed like they came
straight out of the Capitol
from The Hunger Games,
just a little greener. The
costumes of the main
characters, Glinda and
Elphaba in particular, are
what you would expect;
no bells or whistles, but
the simplicity lends itself
well to these classic char-
acters which many would
have first met in the
beloved story The Wizard
of Oz.

I
f you’ve ever had a
bad day and won-
dered how things can
ever get worse, now
you have the answer: Les
Misérables. Inspired by
the 2012 movie which
was itself inspired by this
musical, this production
of Les Mis portrays the
grit, gore and miserable-
ness of life in 19th century
France. If you have read
the original books by
Victor Hugo from the 19th
Century, you probably
don’t have a much of a
clue what is going on in
this notoriously confusing
plot. The story follows
Jean Valjean, a convict on
the run who wants a clean
slate. After the death of
one of his factory work-
ers, Fantine, he agrees to
take her daughter Cosette
under his care. To really
make sure the story of
the orphaned girl whose
mother died due to an
unfortunate foray into
prostitution is miserable
enough, it is all set during
the June rebellion. This
battle sees many charac-
ters meet their fate on a
poetically staged battle
on the barricades where
scores of bodies are left to
rest.
tables, chairs and other
props can simply appear
and disappear as the stage
spins. There are no big
costume changes or huge
sets, mostly due to the fact
that 19th
century France
was quite uniform in its
gloominess. This means
that transitions between
scenes can take place very
quickly and allow for a
continuous and dynamic
story. Like the turbulent
life of the characters, the
audience is never given a
chance to rest.
My Own’ and ‘I Dreamed
a Dream’, some of the
most well recognized
songs in all of musical
theatre. Being the world’s
longest running musical
and now in its 34th
year,
some of the actors today
were not even born when
the original cast took
stage – quite the legacy
to uphold. This can be
daunting, but all the actors
bring something different
to their respective roles
making it a musical to see
time and time again.
Instead, it is the story
and characters which
captivate the audience
and provide the strong
Northern spirit.
Although some aspects
of the musical seem a
little ordinary, the cho-
reography is very fun
and adds to a feel-good
factor. Other shows and
storytellers should take
notes from Everybody’s
Talking About Jamie with
regards to diversity. While
in other shows, diversity
is having a token minority

there are two Muslim girls

it is good to arrive at least
15-20 minutes beforehand
as there can be queues.

Cast Member to Watch…
		 ...Lucie Shorthouse in Everybody’s Talking About Jamie
This British born actress plays the part of Pritti, Jamie’s best friend. Her
standout solo during ‘It Means Beautiful’ shows the potential that she has. Her
voice is spectacular – of course, in a West End musical you expect amazing
voices, but hers is truly a cut above the rest. As part of a big new cast at the end
of January, she left the production and it is not yet certain what her next project
will be, but after an amazing run in this production and winning a ‘WhatsOnStage
Award’ for Best Supporting Actress in a Musical, she is definitely one to watch!

Talking About Jamie,

proudly set in Sheffield, is
the show for you! Based
on the 2011 BBC Three
documentary Jamie: Drag
Queen at 16, it follows a
young 16-year-old boy
who wanted to go to his
prom in drag.
“It is a story
of acceptance,
making

universal”
The musical explores
the reactions of those
around him including his
mother, father and other
classmates as he embarks
on a journey of drag dis-
covery. It is in many ways
a queer story, but it is also
a story of acceptance,
making the themes uni-
versal. As Sheffield seems
