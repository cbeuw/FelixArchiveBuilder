What a mess
T
his week has
been bizarre. In
a week which
saw Shamima
Begum's British citi-
zenship revoked, Jussie
Smollet charged with
beating himself up and
other quite big stories
in the mainstream News
and media, it's been a
surprisingly quiet News
week for Felix. When I
say "what a mess" in the
title of this Editorial,
I am referring to the
front page story about
the decision to cut the
evening bar food ser-
vice at h-bar. It's a real
shitshow and I'll get on
to addressing that in due
course. But first, my
week in review...
This week I had the
pleasure of starring as a
guest on Felix Comment
Editor and Social Boi,
Charlie Titmuss' radio
show, "Face for Radio".
Special shoutout to
Charlie, I can't overstate
how much time, effort and
dedication he puts in to
helping me get the paper
out every week. As Social
Boi, he is also instrumen-
tal in engendering a spirit
of togetherness within the
Felix Family. Anyway,
Charlie has become one
of my favourite people to
have a discussion with and
my guest slot on "Face for
Radio" was an absolute
pleasure. I would invite
him on my own show, "2
Gs in a Pod" (shameless
plug!) but he might not be
qwhite the right fit for my
show.
Anyway, on to the
mess that is navigating
the levels of bureaucracy
that exist between the
Union and College. I
must admit, as I've said
many times before, for
four years here as an
undergraduate student, I
took absolutely no interest
in the Union or College.
As an employee here, I
can't say that has changed
much. Although I am
naturally more involved
2
in the affairs of the Union
and College, by virture of
my current role, there is
a clear misunderstanding
that is prevalent at all
levels of the management
in both the College and
the Union. This misun-
derstanding is highlighted
by the decision to cut the
food offering in h-bar. It is
another example of a de-
cision being taken without
student consultation and
is indicative of the fact
that those making the
decisions continue to fail
to realise that the univer-
sity should prioritise the
interests of its staff and
students above all else.
The manner in which the
decision was made - lack
of student consultation,
differing stories from both
the College and Union
sides and (seemingly)
unbeknownst to the sab-
batical officers - is fankly
unacceptable. The fact
that the sabbatical officers
were only made aware of
the decision a week before
it was initially supposed
to come into effect merely
serves to further high-
light the chasm between
SMG and the Sabbs.
Furthermore, it screams
to me that College doesn't
respect the Sabbs as col-
leagues and equals when
the university's bottom
line is in question. How
are the Sabbs meant to
effect meaningful change
if they're not given a
seat at the table (word
to Solange) when deci-
sions like this are made?
Anyway, don't mind me.
I just make my paper,
sip my tea and mind my
business...
Section of the Week
goes to the Arts Section.
I crashed one of the Arts
Editor socials and had a
brilliant time. It warms
my heart to see how much
they're enjoying working
on the paper and their
dedication shines through
with yet another stellar
week for Arts! Congrats
and thanks for saving me
with the extra pages
the elected Sabbatical
officers were not consult-
ed prior to the decision
being made and were
only notified on Friday
8th
February, despite the
obvious implications that
such a decision will have
on the Union’s drink
sales. In a statement pro-
vided to Felix on behalf of
Imperial College Union,
Rob Tomkies (Union
President), said:
“The Union only
received a week's notice
that the food service in
h-bar was being cut by
College. We are extremely
disappointed at the lack of
any form of consultation
or conversation with the
Union before this decision
was made. h-bar is one
of the few specifically
a service to the Union that
they no longer say they
can afford.”
officers were not privy
to these discussions once
again highlights an appar-
ent disconnect between
the College and the Union
and, within the Union, a
stark disconnect between
the sabbatical officers and
the Senior Management
Group (SMG) within the
Union.
College has been
accused of using its
“power and wealth
to destroy h-bar” and
demonstrating “once
again that it has absolutely
no regard for the satisfac-
tion of students and staff,
and continues to act as a
profit-driven business,
exploiting its students”, to
which Jane responded:
“Quite the opposite,
I’m trying to keep our bit
going even though it’s
costing us money. We do
a lot behind the scenes to
help that service because
I believe in it but, after
the supper finishes, it is a
Union space.”
Jane continued, claim-
ing that the following was
“It's a
university -
it should be
run in the
interests of the
students, staff,
etc., not in
the interest of
profit”
postgraduate and staff
social spaces on campus
and, as such, the effect that
this will have on the com-
munity is unacceptable. In
the mean-time the Union
is looking at how to min-
imise the impact of their
decision and ensure that
h-bar remains a key part
of the post graduate social
community. The bottom
line is our postgraduates
make up half our mem-
bership, we’re committed
to building our offering
and how we support them
going forward and we’re
not going to let a College
decision unduly impact
that.”
Speaking to Felix,
Jane Neary, Director of
Campus Services in the
College, responded to the
criticism, saying: “That
service is not a College
service, it’s a service to
the Union to supplement
their bar service; I’ve axed
put to the Union: “We’re
selling your product,
this product is now no
longer affordable. Do
you want to pay more
for this product, either by
charging the end-user, or
do you want to subsidise
the chef, because it’s not
cost-effective?”
The decision was alleg-
edly then taken following
the Union declining to
meet the College halfway.
When questioned on
why students were not
engaged prior to the
decision being made,
Jane replied: “Because
it wasn’t our service.
The service wasn’t to the
students, the service was
to the Union because it
was there to supplement
their beer service. It
wasn’t a college service.
The college service is the
supper service.” This re-
sponse has been criticised
due to the perception that
stopping the service to
the Union will, by exten-
sion, ultimately deprive
the student body of said
College settles bursary saga
T
he 2015-2016
cohort bursary
scheme saga
is coming to a
patchy end, with affect-
ed students having been
contacted on Monday
18th
February about new
available opportunities
being funded.
The affected students
were notified of the oppor-
tunities that they would be
eligible for, funded by the
£250,000 set aside by the
College. These include
Undergraduate Research
Opportunities Programs
(UROPs), Careers
services, and overseas
electives for medical
students.
However, this corre-
spondence comes with
almost a month’s delay
from the initial announce-
ment of the secured
£250,000 funding during
the 22nd January Union
Council meeting, adding
insult to injury to what
has been perceived as
sub-standard management
of the situation.
The Imperial Bursary,
settled by the College and
the Union two years prior
to the entry of students
receiving them, is given
to undergraduate home
students with annual
household incomes of
up to £60,000. Because
of a 2013 government
decision to make the
National Scholarship
Program unavailable to
undergraduate students,
the bursary scheme for
students entering in 2015
saw a £500,000 drop in
funding. The College and
Union decided to reduce
the financial support pack-
ages for students under
the £35,000 - £60,000
income bracket. However,
in 2014, when the College
and Union decided to
increase the bursary for
students entering in 2016,
they overlooked any
further reimbursement for
the 2015 cohort.
These “unintended
consequences” saw the
2015 cohort left with less
funding than the cohorts
either side of it; these stu-
dents received lower bur-
saries than those who had
enrolled a year earlier and
a year later. According to
the 2018 Imperial College
Union Bursary Survey, the
bursary was “essential” to
the living costs of 71% of
respondents, and to the
accommodation costs of
63% of respondents. The
2015 bursary scheme is
estimated to have effected
around 200 undergraduate
students. Many of these
students have already
graduated or are in their
final year, and the College
has come under criticism
for taking until now to
reimburse their financial
provision.
A member of staff
commented on the inade-
quate 2015-2016 bursary
scheme management,
“I was mortified to read
the article on the student
support packages that
were lower a few years
ago, and how the college
just played the long game
to obfuscate until most of
the affected students were
out of the system. What
a piss weak way to deal
with mistakes. So often
the case at Imperial.”
service.
The "supper service"
refers to the buffet service
which is available from
5-7pm and has been ex-
tended such that it is now
on offer from Monday to
Friday. h-bar users are
also now allowed to bring
any foods / get take away
delivered into the bar.
Discussions between
the Union and College
are ongoing, in an attempt
to arrive at a suitable
contingency plan until
something more perma-
nent can be agreed. It
has been suggested that
the Union could use the
shared kitchen to provide
Imperial College Union
food at h-bar, which could
“make the bar/restaurant
thrive”. This option is
under consideration.
Disgruntled staff and
students are being encour-
aged to sign a student-led
online petition attempting
to overturn the decision
prior to it coming into
effect next Friday.
Jane also claims that
this decision should
come as no shock, given
that discussions between
College and the Union
have been ongoing for the
past eight months. The
fact that the sabbatical
