Oscars 2019: Felix Film’s take on the Winners, the
Academy Prediction:
Probably Green Book or
The Favourite
What we want to win: I’d
want to see Roma win,
personally; maybe it might?
BlacKkKlansman probably
would win if this was 10
years ago. Anything except
a Star is Born.

T
his year’s
A n i m a t e d
Feature Film cat-
egory is the most
stacked we’ve seen in
recent history. Not only do
we have the long awaited
sequel to The Incredibles,
but also an actually great
Spiderman movie with
beautiful art and great
story that spawned a cult
following.
T
he nominees
for Best Picture
are arguably the
most diverse they
have ever been, nominat-
ing films about people of
colour and films featuring
non-white actors in lead
roles. One of the nom-
inees is Black Panther,
the first superhero film
to be nominated—but its
inclusion has been con-
troversial. Is the Academy
blatantly ticking boxes
for the wrong reasons?
Perhaps. Does it actually
stand a chance? Perhaps
not.
Roma certainly will
leave the other nominees
quaking in their seats,
but no “foreign language
film” has ever won
the award for Best
Picture—could this be the
year? Alfonso Cuaron’s
incredible film about
a housemaid in 1970s
Mexico City is thoroughly
worthy. The safe choice is
BlaKkKlansman, the story
about a black undercover
police officer infiltrating
the Ku Klux Klan. It’s
impressively ballsy,
zesty and unflinchingly
humorous. A deserving
film that’s made with a
fistful of passion. - SSM
A
lfonso Cuaron
is surely the
strongest can-
didate in the list
of nominees, winning this
category at the BAFTAs
and at the Golden Globes.
Roma was exceptionally
directed—from the flare
of fluidity in the way the
camera scans the scene,
to getting the incredible
performances from the
actors. Yorgos Lanthimos
(The Favourite) could
potentially grab a steal
at the final hurdle, but he
would need to sell his soul
to Harvey Weinstein. And
on that topic, no women
directors were nominated
this year. Apparently,
you can’t use more than
one diversity coupon in
conjunction with another.
-SSM
Adam McKay picked
up a nomination for di-
rection alongside multiple
other nominations for
Academy Prediction:
Alfonso Cuaron or close
second Yorgos Lanthimos
What we want to win:
Another case of if
BlacKkKlansman was made
10 years ago Spike Lee
would take it, otherwise
it’ll be nice to see Yorgos
Lanthimos take it.
Vice, even with the
lukewarm reaction from
American reviewers.
What is good to see
is the Academy didn’t
follow the BAFTAS in a
Bradley Cooper nomina-
tion, which although has
been marked as a snub,
isn’t at all deserving. -MD
And that’s not all, an
entry from renowned Wes
Anderson, with Isle of
Dogs, and the first non
Studio Ghibli anime ever
to be nominated for the
category, Mirai, is coming
up closely behind.
With the “weakest”
showing of the bunch
being the sequel to
Wreck-it Ralph, Ralph
Breaks the Internet, which
itself is a fantastic family
movie, and pretty flawless
start to finish, it just puts
into perspective just how
high quality the nominees
are this year.
Although it would be
nice to see Mirai dethrone
Studio Ghibli as an
Anime Oscar winner, it
just doesn’t quite hit the
same high notes as Enter
the Spiderverse, nor does
it have the nostalgic hype
that comes with The In-
credibles 2.
No matter which way
it goes, it’s safe to say it
won’t be a disappointing
result. -MD
Academy Prediction:
Spiderman: Enter the
Spiderverse or The
Incredibles 2.
What we want to win: Any
of them, although “The Boss
Baby: Back in Business”
was snubbed of a nom/win.
Academy Prediction: Roma
or Shoplifters.
What we want to win:
It would be good to see
Shoplifters pick up another
deserved big win, but Roma
and Cold War are equally
deserved.
F
oreign language
this year is not
only picking up
nominations in
this category but all over
the Oscars.
With Paweł Paw-
likowski’s breathtaking
Cold War, picking up
nominations for Direction
and Cinematography
alongside it’s best Foreign
Language, it stands a
strong contender the win.
As well as this,
Hirokazu Kore-eda’s
Shoplifters has been
picking up a lot of awards
at different ceremonies,
including the Palme d’Or
for its heart wrenching
look into a life in poverty.
Although the compe-
tition is tough going up
against Alfonso Cuaron’s
black and white, critically
acclaimed, Netflix mas-
terpiece, Roma, it will be
interesting to see if Netflix
distributed and Netflix
originals start to pick up
more awards at prestig-
ious ceremonies like this,
even after the academy’s
general distaste to the
online streaming platform.
It’s hard to gauge who
will win overall with such
a strong trio, winning
a multitude of awards
across lots of ceremonies.
My heart lies with Shop-
lifters, but my money’s on
Roma. -MD

R
ami Malek
took home the
BAFTA and the
Golden Globe
for his performance in
Bohemian Rhapsody. On
top of that, it seems the
Oscars really, really, really
like Bohemian Rhapsody
this year, so it’s going to
be tough to edge out Rami
Malek. -SSM
When it comes down
R
achel Weisz/
Emma Stone.
One of them
from The
Favourite is bound to
win; it’s just statistically
more likely. Friendly
competition, but Weisz
took home the BAFTA for
Best Supporting Actress,
and so is edging ahead.
It’s going to be a close
one. -SSM
M
a h e r s h a l a
Ali already
has a Best
Supporting
Actor to his name, from
his performance in
Moonlight, back in 2016.
The performances of Ali
and Viggo Mortensen
elevates Green Book into
more than the sum of
its parts. Solidifying Ali
as top candidate in my
mind.-SSM
Sam Rockwell and his
to who I don’t want to see
win, it is a no brainer with
Bradley Cooper. William
Dafoe’s performance was
relatively forgettable;
Rami Malek and Christian
Bale both did good jobs
at impersonation; Viggo
Mortensen was fine. It’s
not a good lineup this
year. -MD
Academy Prediction: Rami
Malek or Viggo Mortensen
What we want to win: There
is nothing that has stuck
with me more than old fat
Christian Bale, anything but
Bradley Cooper.
Academy Prediction: Olivia
Coleman
What we want to win: We’d
like to see Olivia Coleman
continue winning awards,
but failing that, Yalitza
Aparicio for Roma is great.
Academy Prediction:
Mahershala Ali
What we want to win: Sam
Rockwell being able to
portray George Bush to that
level of accuracy is definetly
something that should be
awarded, but we’d like to
see Mahershala Ali win.
Academy Prediction: Rachel
Weisz or Emma Stone
What we want to win:
Regina King or Marina
de Tavira for both of their
stellar performances do
deserve to pick up the Oscar,
if there were two awards,
they deserve both.
Costume Design
Academy Prediction: The
Favourite or Black Panther.
What we want to win: Black
Panther Music (Score and
Song)
Academy Prediction: Isle
of Dogs (Score) and All the
Stars (Song)
What we want to win:See
above.
Cinematography
Academy Prediction: Roma
What we want to win: Roma
or Cold War.
C
inematography
is a hard cate-
gory this year,
with not one,
but two black and white
films praised at multiple
festivals for their use of
colour. It’s going to be
hard to predict, but very
likely one of Roma or
Cold War. -MD
Make-up and
Hairstyling
D
espite how tal-
ented the other
makeup and
hairstyling is,
especially Mary Queen of
Scots, this category is a no
brainer for me. It just has
to be Christian Bale’s un-
believable transformation
in Vice. -MD
Academy Prediction: Vice
What we want to win: Vice.
a very clear winner for
me, and that’s Yalitza
Aparicio, there is no over-
looking her performance
in Roma, and she deserves
to take home the Oscar.
Knowing the Academy
however I have strong
feelings that Olivia
Coleman will take the
win, deservedly, but still
in the shadow of Apari-
cio’s performace. -MD
Regina King picked up
one of the unfortunately
few nominations for If
Beale Street Could Talk,
and she definitely deserves
it. In an ideal world either
she or Marina de Tavira
would pick up the world,
but looking at previous
award ceremonies, it
looks like The Favourite
is going to pick up another
award here. -MD
impression of George
W. Bush in Vice really
captivates the slimyness
of the real thing and that
can’t be ignored as a
outstanding performance.
Adam Driver falls in a
similar category with a
performance that can’t
be ignored but I feel they
both fall just short of Ma-
hershala Ali. - MD
T
hisisahardjudge.
On one hand the
Academy loves
period drama
costuming, and the nom-
inees are ripe, however
Black Panther bought
something that deviates
from the western centric
norm. -MD

L a m a r
pick up an
Oscar? It’s
likely. Isle of Dogs defi-
nitely deserves the best
score,. -MD
