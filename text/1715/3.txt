confidence, celebrate in-
dividuality and create an
authentic network of unity
amongst those involved in
and attending this year’s
Fashion Show. We would
like to reassure our student
population that insecuri-
ties are commonplace and
something that many of us
struggle with. The #YK-
MNCampaign aims to
get students sharing their
own personal perspectives
and experiences regarding
confidence, the purpose of
this being to break down
the barriers people have
to feeling comfortable in
their own unique identi-
ties.
The Campaign
launched on Monday 18th
February and is being
showcased on all our
social media platforms.
If you would like to get
involved in the #YKMN-
Campaign please contact

the show are available to
buy on Monday 25th
Feb-
ruary from the Imperial

conversation one step
further and to inspire one
another to be sensitive to
the fact that what meets
the surface isn’t always
telling of what’s beneath.
How we’re doing it
obvious to the excitable
audience is that the
outward confidence ob-
served for the ten second
catwalk may not be a re-
flection of how the model
is actually feeling while
walking down it.

T
he ICSM RAG
‘You Know My
Name’ Fashion
Show 2019,
held at The Clapham
Grand on 12th
March, is
the most exuberant fund-
raising event hosted by
the Medical School. The
evening entails a deca-
dent display of unique
fashion, donated by
twelve up-and-coming
designers, and modelled
by Imperial College’s
very own students.
The night delights its
six-hundred strong audi-
ence through a multitude
of arts; from Fashion, to
Music, to Dance to ex-
traordinary entertainment.
The students of Imperial
unite to experience an in-
credibly beautiful display
of creativity whilst also
fundraising for two
charities selected by
ICSM RAG; Child Action
and Community Action
Nepal. Whether some-
body is involved in the
production of the show,
or simply buys a ticket to
enjoy it from the stalls,

an astonishing amount of
effort is expended prior to
and during the evening, to
ensure a huge amount is
raised in aid of the chosen
causes.

“I know I said
I wanted to
do it but,
truthfully...
I just don't
feel confident
enough”
There are a whole host
of different reasons as to
why people want to take
part in Fashion Show.
However, the assumption
that all of those audition-
ing and taking part were
already filled to the brim
with self-confidence and
wanted to get involved
just to show off that fact,
was one we were clearly
wrong about. To the
Fashion Show committee,
it has already become
clear that the build-up of
Fashion Show, through
the audition process up
until the last rehearsal,
invites a conversation
about self-confidence and
self-doubt amongst the
students.
Year on Year, the ICSM
RAG Fashion Show con-
tributes an amazing dona-
tion towards the elected
charities. However, we’ve
now realised that this
“Looking at
everyone
walking this
year, there
isn't one look
that defines
everyone”
Whilst the successful,
12-year-running Fashion
Show primarily focuses
on the links between
fashion, entertainment
and student-led fundrais-
ing, there are several other
aspects that come with
partaking in a production
of its magnitude. As with
any student-led event
involving a large number
of young people, ensuring
the large variety of needs
of those involved are
correctly mitigated for is
absolutely essential.
A Fashion Show has
students walking down
a runway in front of
their cheering peers and
colleagues. Boosts of
confidence come in the
form of bright lights and
camera flashes, and the
commendations following
the show could provide
enough affirmation to
last until the Summer.
However, something that
may not be immediately
“I might wait
for next year
when I’ve had
a chance to go
to the gym”
Confidence comes from
within, but it is so often
influenced by external
factors, social norms and
stereotypes. The Fashion
Show Theme, ‘You Know
My Name’, was chosen to
depict a very real and easy
mistake that all of us are
guilty of making at some
time or another. We are
taught not to judge a book
by its cover throughout
our lives but, somehow, it
is a bias we are all at risk
of succumbing to.
The opportunity to
engage in honest and open
exchanges pertaining to
self-confidence and self-
doubtisonethatweshould
nurture. Members of the
Fashion Show Team have
gained valuable insights
about the fine balance
between these constructs
after speaking to the stu-
dents of Imperial College
about their thoughts about
walkingdownthecatwalk.
Professional models and
actors are given tools and
techniques for overcom-
ing image concerns, stage
fright and opening night
nerves. However, at our
amateur level, perhaps
it’s time for the students
of Imperial College to
take the self-awareness
This year, we are
launching the ‘You Know
My Name’ Campaign
(#YKMNCampaign) to
encourage a conversation.
We want to dispel some
of the myths surrounding
who our models are, and
what’s brought them to
getting involved, and let
people see Fashion Show
for what it truly is: a fan-
tastic experience for all of
those who are taking part!
During the campaign,
models will be sharing
their personal experiences
on their social media, hu-
manising their take on the
show and revealing their
motivations for taking
part.

tuous environment, an
