on from the
success of the
R o e h a m p t o n
Uni Cup, Imperial
College Squash Men’s
1st Team travelled up to
Birmingham last weekend
(9th & 10th of February)
to compete in the BUCS
Premier Division play-
off where the top eight
universities around the
country gather to decide
their placings for the up-
coming BUCS knock-out
stages.
Imperial Men’s 1st
were once again playing
for a spot between 5th -=
and 8th hoping to repeat
last year’s success in fin-
ishing 5th by winning all
of their matches.
The first match was
“The Imperial
team knew
that this was
an important
match to
win to carry
momentum
into the
weekend and
nerves were
running high”
against Newcastle on
Saturday morning who
finished 6th last year by
just narrowly losing to
Imperial in a closely con-
tested match. The Imperial
team knew that this was
an important match to win
to carry momentum into
the weekend and nerves
were running high.
So it was a soothing
surprise and a huge moral
boost when the team
turned up to the venue
to find that the “Tree
Chopper” a.k.a. Patrick
Brandl was there waiting
for us. He had made the
effort to catch a 6 a.m.
train to come all the way
from London to cheer his
team-mates on.
What difference does
that extra support make?
Well Imperial beat New-
castle 4-1 this time around
with Seigo “Top knot’ch”
avenging his last year’s
defeat by saving 5 match
balls against him to win
3-2.
The second match was
rather straightforward for

and Patrick Brandl. // IC Squash
of energy despite only
a couple hours sleep, to
commence the final battle,
and what a battle it was…
Squash is a brutal sport.
Like any other racket
sport, skill and tactics
are important but the
physical demands that
squash places on the body
are widely considered
to be the toughest of any
sport. Players will hit
their maximum heart rate
repeatedly in even just a
single rally.
A rally can last in the
region of fifty shots, and it
is common for players to
average between 5km and
10km in lunges alone over
the course of a match.
In the case of the
hound’s opponent, he hit
his maximum heart rate
too many times, vomiting
from sheer exhaustion on
court in the middle of an
epic rally. In squash terms,
this is a TKO – match
forfeited.
James was not alone
in proving his physical
superiority, with veteran
Dave “Iceman” Newman
rolling back the years to
floor his opponent (literal-
ly – he passed out after the
match only to resurface
two hours later). Marco
“Players
will hit their
maximum
heart rate
repeatedly
in even just a
single rally”
the team against Lough-
borough. Everyone won
their matches, meaning
that the team won by 5-0.
And it was looking like
5th place would once
again be within reach with
just Nottingham Trent,
only recently promoted
to the big leagues, to
beat on Sunday morning.
But Nottingham Trent
had shown already that
they were at home in the
top division by inflicting
defeats on both Lough-
borough and Newcastle
on the Saturday. Imperial
would therefore need to
steel themselves for a
close fight for that coveted
5th spot at the top of their
group.
With the “Tree
Chopper” on his way back
to his cabin in the woods,
the team made their way
to the venue the follow-
ing morning with some
trepidation. Would Dave
“N’iceman” Newman’s
aging body hold up to
another tough match?
Would Puven “Psych”
Sivasangari finish digest-
ing the all-you-can-eat
carb-loading sushi session

from the previous night?
The answer to these ques-
tions and the outcome of
the match were all coming
down to the wire. Up
steps James “The Hound”
McCouat, somehow full
“Amy” Alves then closed
out the match in style and
5th place in the country
once again belonged to
Imperial Men’s 1st.

await us in the knock-out
stages, but you’d be a
brave punter to bet against
the mighty mad dog and
his Imperial men.
