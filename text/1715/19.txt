The brilliant mess of the Birmingham pantomime
ARTS

P
antomimes follow
a simple formula
- jokes, colourful
costumes and a
pervasive camp atmos-
phere combining to form
family entertainment. As
had been family tradition
for over ten years, this
Christmas I experienced
the Birmingham panto-
mime. Now, experienced
really is the word - as in
that time it has devolved
into simultaneously a per-
fect distillation but also
parody of the genre, and at
this point exists entirely to
entertain the adults. Don’t
get me wrong, the funny
man doing the big fart and
the colourful dresses keep
children entertained, but
the endless sex jokes and
dated references reveal
its true colours. But it is
definitely still pantomime.
It has laughs for days,
the most flamboyant cos-
tumes you will ever see,
and by god it’s camper
than a weekend in the
Peak District with Freddie
Mercury. Frankly I feel it
needs documenting.
This year’s show re-
sembled Peter Pan. I say
resembled as, while many
characters were present,
there was also a sizeable
amount of random devia-
tion. The “buttons”- alike
(played by a man named
Matt slack who literally
carries the entire show)
was Mr. Smee, rewritten
as the nanny of the kids
and a spy for them once
in Neverland. There is
also a fairy godmother
character, who you may
be surprised to find is
not actually a fairy but a
magical mermaid with
short term memory loss
who flies around in a giant
clam shell. Buckle up, we
are just getting started.
While the kids fly to
Neverland with fairy dust,
Mr. Smee travels by means
of flying vesper which is
hydraulically lifted above
the audience in a very
convincing effect. Upon
arrival the plot proceeds
to play in both high speed
and slow motion. The
show tries to hit all the
important moments of
the source material, but
given half the scenes are
just vehicles to tell jokes,
30% are immaculately
choreographed dance
numbers and 10% are
sudden intense acrobatics
sessions that teach you
the meaning of tension,
there isn’t much time left
for plot. Vital moments
just suddenly happen,
the first time the word
“mum” is used is when
Peter asks Wendy to be
his. Tink drinking the
poison completely alone
is such an immense plot
hole that Smee calls her
a stupid cow. There is a
five-minute scene in the
second-half where Hook
and Smee flirt, ending
with a metaphorical
orgasm when Smee’s
guitar explodes. A joke is
made about Smee having
an inflatable girlfriends
before he returns to save
the day using an extended
matrix parody wherein
physical theatre is used to
show slow motion. Still
with me?
Of course, there are
constant fourth wall
breaks throughout. Along
with the classic “oh no
you didn’t” and such there
are meta jokes about who
the actors are, about the
reality of putting on a
show etc. Donny Osmand
plays Hook and Smee
spends the entire show
asking where Jimmie is;
Wendy at the end makes
a long and painful Brexit
joke to the audience and,
during the final loving
moment between Pan
and Wendy, Smee pipes
up and reminds everyone
that the actor playing Pan
is 35. This immediately
caused the entire cast to
corpse in a moment that
will stick with me forever.
And with that, the
show is basically over
- there is only one more
tradition to fulfil. At the
end, Smee brings four
kids from the audience up
on stage to talk to them
about the show, make
some wholesome jokes to
the audience, give them
presents and make them
feel special. It’s a sweet
way to end the show. I,
having been so many
times, know how easily
this can go awry. This year
for instance one of the kids
wouldn’t stop dancing, at
any point. Another was
so bewildered he could
barely speak, but it all
played out nice in the end.
I would be remiss not to
mention last year though,
wherein one of the
children was a seamless
plant. We know this,
because after seemingly
acting like a show-off to
the audience, the straight-
faced Buttons character
said, “no one likes a
know-it-all”, picked up
the kid and dropped him
into the band’s pit. The
entire audience lost it. The
power of subversion of
expectations.
No doubt, what I wit-
nessed that Christmas Eve
was completely senseless,
barely even trying to tell a
story. But here is the thing,
while it may be nonsense,
deep down, you can’t tell
me you don’t want to ex-
perience it. Over the years
the show has reached the
point of maximum mess.
The whole thing feels like
what you and your mates
might pull together if you
were told you had to put
on a show and had an
hour to prepare, but with
the budget of a Broadway
production. Frankly, there
is nothing I’ve ever expe-
rienced quite like it and
that is why, at 21, I have
every intention of going
again next year - and you
should too.
Finally, I wish to
extend my best wishes
to Donny Osmand who
suffered a stroke mid
show only three days
after I was there. Having
powered through to the
end of the performance
he was rushed to hospital.
He seems to be doing
better now but was unable
to perform subsequent
shows. I hope he makes a
full and speedy recovery.
