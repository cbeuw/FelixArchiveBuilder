A
t the begin-
ning of the
month, Beth
Hammack, a
senior Goldman Sachs
banker and chair of the
government advisory
group know as the
Treasury Bond Advisory
Committee sent a letter to
Steven Mnuchin, Treasury
Secretary, warning that
according to TBAC cal-
culations, America will
need to sell $12 trillion of
bonds before the end of
the decade. The question
loomed that who in the
global financial industry
will buy this vast amount
of treasuries? This is
especially worrying after
China’s holdings of US
treasuries (previously
probably the most reli-
able source for demand
for American debt as it
amassed vast foreign ex-
change reserves amid its
export boom) shrank from
$1.25tn to $1.12tn over
three years. Chinese diplo-
mats deny that this is part
of a political game amid
trade tensions between the
two superpowers. Fang
Xinghai, vice-chairman
of the China Regulatory
Commission stressed that
Beijing does not intend
to “significantly reduce
its investment into the
US government bond
market”. Instead many
investors see the declin-
ing Chinese demand for
US debt as a result of
its slowing imports and
changing demographics.
Furthermore, China is
not alone. Ms. Hammack
warned in her letter about
“a stagnation in interna-
tional reserves” and that
in the future there must
be “an increased need
for this [US] debt to be
financed domestically”.
Fortunately, American
interest rate hikes, causing
cash to funnel into bonds,
whose fixed interest
payments become more
valuable if the base rates
fall. However, this was ex-
pected as Investors feared
that increasing interest
rates would push the US
economy into recession,
bringing to an end a credit
cycle which had seen
companies stockpile low
rate debt. Despite this,
Hans Mikkelsen, a strat-
egist at Bank of America
Merrill Lynch, warned
that a further increase in
supply could test investor
demand as seen with sov-
ereign bonds.
Meanwhile, across
the pond Germany’s
insistence on running a
balanced budget and a
current account surplus
has led to no expansion
in debt issuance.
Consequently, there is an
undersupply of Bunds,
creating a shortage of safe
assets in the eurozone.
This leads to exacerbation
of the price effect of
European Bank bond-
buying, increasing the
spread between German
yields and those of riskier
assets for example Italian
sovereign bonds. The
yield of the 10-year Bund
has slipped this year to
0.1%, increasing the
spread against equivalent
Italian bonds to 2.9%.
EU budget rules do aim
to ward off excessive
surpluses, as the euro was
created “as a means of
strengthening the political
bonds between [European
Nations]” as stated by the
European Commission.
By deliberately under
borrowing you leave the
continent’s banks and
pension funds suffocating
domestic savers have been
filling the gap. American
households held nearly
$2.3tn in Treasuries in
November last year,
increasing from $1.9tn
from January. Despite
this, with the governments
increased spending plans
the need for US debt is
rising. Some hedge-funds
now conclude that in five
years’ time the Treasury
will need to sell bonds
equivalent to 25% of
GDP, up from 15% now.
That level of debt has only
occurred twice in the past
120 years. Once during
the second world war and
again during the 2008
financial crisis. The clear
solution would be for the
Trump administration to
change its fiscal aims and
reduce its reliance of debt,
but with no mention of the
problem during his State
of the Union speech, that
is very unlikely. Further
souring the situation is
the $9 trillion corporate
debt bomb, “bubbling” in
the US economy. Many
Investors worry about this
as the current cash-to-debt
ratio for corporate bor-
rowers fell to 12% (lowest
ever), which means there
is a shortage of cash to
cover this debt. There is
no slowing this advance

Sovereign debt: a tale of two dilemma’s
under a shortage of
safe assets. Is Germany
therefore fulfilling that
pledge? Interestingly the
shortage of bunds has
many investors worried
about bubbles in sectors
such as real estate.
Investors need to put their
money in something and
when there aren’t enough
Bunds going around they
are forced into substitute
assets which become
overloaded and hence
suffer price bubbles.
