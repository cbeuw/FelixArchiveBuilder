Academics riot after Union misplaces SACA mugs
HANGMAN
Staff across multiple
campuses have rioted
in their tens after the
Union announced it
had lost a shipment
of SACA mugs to be
deliveredtonominees.

T
he shipment of
branded mugs,
intended for all
SACA nominees,
was said to be mistaken
by an unassuming staff
member as a delivery for
the Rugby club, causing
it to be promptly thrown
into the bins.
The unrest began after
an e-mail apologising
year I get nominated, they
mess up!”.
Claire Aberkorn, Grad-
uate Teaching Assistant in
the Department of Chem-
istry, was inconsolable at
the news. “This was the
one thing I was looking
forward to,” she wailed.
“I’m underpaid, over-
worked, and now I don’t
even get my mug - I’m
not paying 20p extra for a
stupid paper cup!”
When confronted
with the news, Amadeo
Buy, Deputy President
(Emancipation), immedi-
ately became defensive.
“Look, I already went
round campus in that
weird green gimp suit,” he
complained, “ what more
do you want from me, for
fuck’s sake!”
This year’s SACAs
have been plagued with
disappointment - the
Union was criticised for
an overtly aggressive
approach in promoting the
awards, with allegations
of students being flogged
to fill out nomination
forms in the Library group
study area.
This was followed by a
I’d be pissed if I didn’t get mine too // Imperial College Union
disappointing number of
nominations being made,
with only 500 being put
in, half of which were put
in from an IP addressed
registered to UCL, in
what is believed to be
an attempt to undermine
ICU’s democracy.
“I already went
round campus
in that weird
green gimp
suit, what
more do you
want from
me?!”
“How the fuck
do you lose a
box of mugs
[..] the Union’s
filled with‘em,
and I’m not
talking about
the cups!”
Common Room, flipping
tables and breaking
trays in protest. Similar
scenes were reported
in Hammersmith and
Charing Cross campuses,
though Silwood was
notably quiet, as the WiFi
was down.
Ronny Greaves,
Reader in Advanced
Molecular Madness in the
Department of Chemical
Engineering, was irate
at the Union’s blunder.
“How the fuck do you
lose a box of mugs?!?,”
he ranted, “the Union’s
filled with them, and
I’m not talking about the
cups! Do you know how
many hints I had to drop
to my students - every
lecture for the past 6 years
- I even poked them on
Facebook! And the one
for the blunder was sent
round to all nominees
on Wednesday. Within
minutes, angry crowds
gathered in the Senior
“Now I don’t
even get my
mug - I’m not
paying 20p
extra for a
stupid paper
cup!”

The President of
Imperial College
Investment Society
(ICIS)hasbeenbanned
from the Union over
an apparent mix-up.
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
J
ohann Arrundfeld
was informed that
his membership of
Imperial College
Union was rescinded
when he attempted to
enter the Union Bar for
a pint after lectures this
Tuesday.
It is believed that the
confusion arose over his
similarities in his society’s
name to an established
terror group, though Neg-
aFelix has been unable to
confirm which one.
“I knew this would
happen,” he told NegaFe-
lix, “when we started up
we thought the name ICIS
sounded kind of cool and
sexy, you know? Now
people keep sending me
hate mail on my LinkedIn
profile, saying ‘hope you
die of ringworm, you
fucking scum.’ I’m never
advertising as ‘open to
recruiters’ again - all I
wanted was a damn spring
week!”.
The decision has been
constested by the rest of
the ICIS committee, who
question the intelligence
of the Union. “There’s
no way they can be that
dumb,” said Nicky Shoo,
club Secretary, “there’s
a letter difference - how
has no one in that building
figured that out?”.
Yob Dumfries, Union
President, refused to
change his decision to
exile Johann. “The Union
stands for democracy and
justice, and those people
are a scurge on our values!
Plus we’re running out of
money and we need to
confiscate their accounts
to keep h-bar running.”
Supporters of the
decision have pushed for
the Union to crack down
harder on ICIS. “Just get
rid of them all together,”
said Catelyn Tarantenova,
President of FinanceSoc.
“There’s only room for
one money-grabbing CSP
on campus and we’re not
going anywhere anytime
soon.”
