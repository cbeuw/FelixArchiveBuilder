Politics writer Ansh Bhatnagar thinks that the small group of MPs that left the Labour party
have committed themselves to a failed ideology that was popular prior to the 2008 financial
crash. They’re certainly not deserving of his support.

O
n Monday
morning, a
group of 7
Labour MPs
took the unprecedented
step of leaving the Labour
Party and forming a new
centrist “party”, taking
the incredibly bland name
of ‘The Independent
Group’. Except it was
not unprecedented at
all – most of these MPs,
such as their ringleader
Chuka Umunna, have
been vocally and visibly
opposed to the Labour
Party ever since 2015,
when Jeremy Corbyn
achieved a landslide
victory in the leadership
election. They were also
part of the 2016 coup
when the Parliamentary
Labour Party (PLP) forced
Corbyn into another
leadership election, which
he won with an increased
vote share. The leaks
Their official Statement
of Independence cites
that they believe “none of
today’spoliticalpartiesare
fit to provide the leader-
ship and direction needed
by our country”. They say
their aim is to pursue “ev-
idence-based” policies not
based on ideology. Such
a display of ignorance
would be quite shocking
for seasoned politicians
if it didn’t fit in with the
usual centrist talking
points. All politicians
are led by ideology, and
according to the statement
theirs is an ideology of
Blair and Clinton’s Third
Way from the 90s, of a
“social market economy”
and a pro-war, pro-in-
tervention military state.
They believe that a bit of
regulation and welfare
on an otherwise neolib-
eral capitalist system is
enough to combat the
issues of rising inequality,
economic exploitation,
homelessness and climate
change. Angela Smith,
one of the seven, has been
a supporter of Thatcher’s
water privatisation,
having vested interests in
the industry. They even
draw from Conservative
talking points, claiming
that opportunity is the
way for individuals to
leave poverty, rather than
committing to eliminat-
ing poverty altogether.
The verdict is clear; it
is fundamentally a capi-
talist ideology that fails
to address its inherent
contradictions. To claim
that they are not led by
ideology is contradictory
to the rest of their state-
ment and intellectually
dishonest.
This is why I say good
riddance. As a Labour
member I am not inter-
ested in sharing a party
with politicians cosying
up to Tory MPs and those
who believe that the 2017
manifesto is “too radical”,
because it really isn’t. It
is the bare minimum that
this country needs and

“These MPs
wore the red
rosette and
committed
the policies
promised by a
future Labour

the future Labour govern-
ment. They benefitted off
the money the party and
trade unions poured into
their campaigns, as well
as the hard-working ac-
tivists who door-knocked
and canvassed for them –
ordinary citizens suffering
under a Tory government
but volunteering their
own time to get Labour
candidates elected. Their
constituents voted for a
Labour MP standing on
the 2017 manifesto, and
by resigning their Labour
membership to form a
coalition with the Tories,
they have betrayed each
and every one of their
voters and past supporters
policy by policy is what
the public overwhelming-
ly back. The UK centre
ground is in favour of
an end to austerity and
social democracy: having
the wealthy pay their
fair share, having strong
public services with uni-
versal healthcare and free
education from cradle to
grave, and taking water,
energy, gas, the buses,
the railways etc back
into public ownership so
profits can be reinvested
into making our experi-
ences better, cheaper, and
greener. It is in favour of
bold solutions to fight the
climate crisis facing us
today. The centre ground
is with Labour’s 2017
manifesto and that would
be just the start of the
political revolution that
needs to take place in post-
2008 austerity Britain.
These MPs stood on
that manifesto of hope,
and each one of them
increased their vote shares
in the 2017 General
Election, securing their
jobs as MPs earning more
than £77k per annum.
They stood wearing the
red rosette, committed
to implementing these
policies and supporting

to nobody’s surprise. So
why did they join with
three ex-Conservatives
and leave Labour?

who got them these jobs.
They refuse to stand
down as MPs and call
by-elections to campaign
honestly on their new plat-
forms. That’s a personal
sacrifice they are not
willing to make for their
new politics. Instead they
have formed a political
grouping, ‘The Independ-
ent Group’: it is asking
for donations, asking for
people to sign up, it is
speaking as one voice – in
short, acting like a politi-
cal party. However, they
have not registered as a
political party, but instead
as a private company that
does not have to disclose
its donors. Every action
they’ve taken is shady and
dodgy, and shows they
lack any conviction in
their own political beliefs.
The conversation
wouldn’t be complete
without mentioning
another reason that these
MPs cite for leaving: the
problem of antisemitism
in the Labour Party.
Luciana Berger is a
tropes, and especially how
left-wing views regard-
ing the Israel-Palestine
conflict can sometimes
become too accommodat-
ing to antisemitic rhetoric
in the fringes. Momentum,
the successor of Jeremy
Corbyn’s leadership
campaign, has done some
excellent work producing
educational videos that
reach the very minority
that espouses this racist
rhetoric; but we need the
Party to take inspiration
from them and listen to
Jewish members in order
to truly eradicate antisem-
itism from our movement.
The other MPs cite
antisemitism as a reason
for them leaving as
well, claiming that this
new “party” will be a
socially progressive
voice. However, this
claim quickly collapsed
a mere 3 hours after the
launch, with the group
being embroiled in a
racist scandal – Angela
Smith went on national
TV and referred to ethnic
minorities as people with
a “funny tinge”. Smith
issued a weak non-apol-
ogy later, apologising for
“any offence caused” and
claiming she misspoke.
For 1/7th of the member-
ship of a new ‘anti-racist’
party to promote racist
rhetoric within three hours
of launching must be some
sort of record. None of the
other six MPs denounced
before the Labour Party
investigations into them
could be completed.
Among the seven is
also Gavin Shuker, who
threatened to resign from
the Shadow Cabinet if the
Labour Party supported
gay marriage – in the end
he abstained on it. It is
evident that ‘The Inde-
pendent Group’ are not a
socially progressive group
by any measure.
Labour, while not
perfect, is still the best
vehicle for any sort of
progressive politics. With
a mass membership of
half a million making
it the largest party in
Europe, it is backed and
funded by ordinary people
from all over the country.
Due to the massive
ongoing democratisation
project, it has become the
only party where ordinary
working people can take
part in politics and make
their voice heard – where
members are valued and
not just treated like a
campaigning tool.
Unfortunately, it is
clear that The Independent
Group is just another re-
gressive Third Way tribute
act from the 90s, trying to
resurrect a zombie politics
that has long been dead.
They claim to oppose a
right-wing Tory Brexit,
but by standing against
the Labour Party they
have made that outcome
much more likely, risking
the country facing a
disastrous no deal Brexit
because of their opportun-
ism. Ultimately, they will
fail like the SDP before
them and merge with the
Liberal Democrats, but
until then, they are only
assisting the Tories in
their pursuit of a tax haven
austerity Britain.

antisemitism, but about
policy as well. Choosing
to conveniently brush
aside antisemitism when
it suits them, to the point
of not even mentioning it
on their official Statement
of Independence despite
mentioning it in their
televised speeches, makes
their commitment to an-
ti-racism questionable at
best and a cynical political
lie at worst.
There are also rumours
that the group will
welcome ex-Labour MPs
