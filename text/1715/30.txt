ICAmerican Football: Immortals Charge to a 40-0 win
W
ith the
end of the
s e a s o n
i n s i g h t ,
we are in the middle of a
two-part relegation battle.
The battle is against the
Canterbury Christ Church
Chargers a team who, like
us, have sustained a losing
record throughout the
season. Due to the league
timetabling, our matches
against them are the final
two consecutive matches
of the season. This meant
that the loser of this
series will get relegated
to Division 2. Both teams
were eager to get on with
it, and the energy was the
highest it has been all
season.
The first game was at
Fortress Harlington. The
Chargers took the opening
kick-off. The offence did
not start off well on the
first drive as we seemed
destined for a three-and-
out. However, one of the
Canterbury players failed
to cleanly field the ensuing
punt, and we were able to
capitalize on this mistake
and recover the ball,
which kept the opening
drive alive. We marched
on with powerful running
by Jonas “Dreadnought”
Eschenfelder all the way
to their 10-yard line. Un-
fortunately, they managed
to intercept a wobbly pass
at their own two-yard line,
leaving the Chargers with
difficult field-position.
Our vaunted defence
came out of the gate hot
almost getting a safety and
forcing Canterbury to punt
from inside their own yard
line. The lack of space
and the heavy pressure
resulted in a blocked punt
we recovered at their
15-yard line. From there a
couple of passes and a QB
sneak play resulted in us
opening the score 8-0. We
never slowed down from
that point until the half,
only allowing a single first
down from the Chargers
and scoring three more
touchdowns thanks, to
great passing by Ben “Big
Red” O’Brien that made
up for his earlier intercep-
tion. This led to the score
being 26-0 at the half.
Canterbury were
somewhat able to neutral-
ize the offence, but they
could not find an answer
to get past our defensive
front eight, especially
our nose tackle Michael
“Drama Sec” Anyanechi.
We kept stifling their
QB by penetrating their
offensive line that looked
more like a sieve than a
wall by the second half,
which all culminated by
Dom “RoadRage Gang”
DeSilva recovering a
fumble in the end zone
for a touchdown. Also,
special shout out to
Nick “Daddy” Hoare for
handling his first game
at center with plenty of
poise.
The final score was
40-0 in our favour, but
this is only half the battle.
Part 2 coming next week.

Taekwondo’s Winter Championships spirit unbeatable
T
wenty members
of Imperial
C o l l e g e
T a e k w o n d o
(ICUTKD) travelled to
Nottingham for the Winter
Championships held
by the British Student
Taekwondo Federation
(BSTF). Returning home
are 21 medals: ten bronze,
seven silver and four gold
across all disciplinaries.
There has been an overall
improvement in individ-
uals’ performances since
the previous competition
in November. As ever,
guiding and supporting
the students were our
instructors, Master Reza
Saberi and Christopher
Dancel.
The championship took
place at Nottingham Trent
University and opened up
entries to both poomsae
and sparring in World
Taekwondo (WT) and
International Taekwondo
Federation (ITF). Taek-
wondo is a Korean martial
art and WT-style have
been part of the Olympics
since 2002.
Although ICUTKD
mainly focus on WT,
a handful of members
continues to practise ITF.
Savya Aggarwal (gold
and silver), Angela Sun
(silver and bronze) and
Wenbo Chen (bronze) are
our main representatives
in the competition. The
club encourages both dis-
ciplines to work together.
Johnny Kim (bronze)
won his first medal in
ITF sparring; he is our
alumni who started his
taekwondo journey with
ICUTKD, training in WT
for four years.
The club saw another
treasured alumni and club
coach as anA-class fighter
as Liyan Chow (bronze),
demonstrated years of
practice in the ring. Other
A-class fighters using the
electronicgearswereSojin
Park (bronze) and Jamie
McNeil (silver). Special
mention to beginner
Thomas Kloska (bronze)
and first-time competitors
Gino La (bronze) and
Myriam (silver and gold),
who fought persistently
for countless numbers of
rounds.
Aside from sparring,
there is poomsae which
involves strength and
conditioning training.
There were outstanding
performances from our
beginners Lucy Lei (gold),
Camille Cheng (silver),
Thomas Kloska (silver),
Tara Sassel and Zeme
Andrews-Haycocks.
Our returning members
continued to stand their
ground as Cynthia Ho
(bronze), Sophia Ppali
(silver) and Andrew Bates
(gold) showed off hours
of practice prior to the
competition.
With the scale of com-
petition bigger than ever,
the championship series is
prime opportunity to learn
from opponents and bond
with other club members.
Also, it conduces the
focus of training.
Ultimately, we take
away much more than
just medals. The overall
rankings will be released
in the final competition of
the Championship series
in March. Until then,
ICUTKD will continue
to train hard and keep the
spirits indomitable.
