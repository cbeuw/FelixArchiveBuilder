Review: Tobacco Road at the Vaults
T
obacco Road
begins with a
standoff, a gang
cornered in a
shootout, directly facing
the audience. The gang
of 1920s ne’er do wells
address the audience. “We
should tell them how we
got here” gesturing at us.
“We’ll have to start all the
way at the beginning”.The
cast run through the years
1918-1920, explaining
why life as gangsters is
so attractive and exciting
in postwar London. The
Great War had left a
legacy of disarray and cor-
ruption, fuelled by alcohol
and cocaine. The cast use
very few props, just a few
crates and bandages to
tell the story. Impressive
theatrics, including chore-
ographed dance routines,
are integrated in a way
that isn’t cheesy or cliché.
This is by far the highlight
of the show.
While the London
accents are far from con-
vincing at times, the char-
acters are well developed.
The plot follows Elsie
(Jennie Eggleton) and
Frida (Atlanta Hayward)
in their struggle to make
money upon having
lost their factory jobs to
returning soldiers. They
join forces with loveable
buffoon Alfie (Dan
Whitlam), sympathetic
brute Tom (Angus Cas-
tle-Doughty) and Felix
(George John), the ring
leader and brains behind
the operation. To begin
with, the gang are at the
bottom of the pile; petty
thieves struggling to make
ends meet.
As they work their way
up the ranks, accumulat-
ing wealth and reputation,
cracks begin to show and
their ambition leads to
of biting off a bit more
than you can chew has
leaked somewhat into the
production. While the in-
dividual performances are
compelling, there is too
much packed in to pace
wellinanhour.Thismeans
the production relies on
a periodic narration, a
repetitive breaking of the
fourth wall to advance
the plot. The result is
somewhat disjointed and
feels rushed and unre-
solved. Some interesting
plot points - the struggles
of a queer boxer and a
gangster with a develop-
ing drug problem - are left
unexplored. Despite these
shortcomings, the show
is worth going to see, if
just to see a boxing ring
transform into a telephone
wire.
If you squint it’s like Peaky Plinders // Tim Hall

their inevitable demise.
It seems the approach
