Rattled: A spotlight on postnatal mental health
R
attled is
Missmanaged
Theatre’s debut
production, both
written and performed by
the multitalented Rachel
Harper. She bravely uses
her platform to raise
awareness of mental
health problems in new
mothers, half of whom
are said to experience it
in their lives. This play is
an eye-opening statement
on a problem that is
underreported and un-
derdiagnosed, likely due
to stigma and traditional
ideas of motherhood.
The play centres around
one such character, Em,
whom we meet on a train
platform, along with what
she thinks is a stranger’s
baby. This baby becomes
her audience, with whom
she begins to share her
life’s story, her confes-
sions, her secrets – and
we, as the real audience,
are privy to all this. She
takes us on a journey
through her turbulent,
traumatic childhood and
disappointing marriage,
littering the dialogue with
moments of sombreness
and bursts of dark humour.
This is what I especially
loved – despite the seri-
ousness of the content,
it is deeply witty; even
with dark subject matter
there are light moments.
Sometimes it is genuinely
comic; other times, Em is
usinghumourtoglossover
damaging life experiences
with a blasé tone and
sarcastic quip, nervously
laughing the way people
do when they talk about
something uncomfortable.
It is techniques like
this that allow this play to
function so successfully
as a one-woman play;
although there are no other
characters to interact with,
there is never any dullness
or struggle to keep the
audience engaged. Even in
the necessary moments of
silence, there is a gravity
and intention behind
the choice, where the
audience can absorb the
words and the emotions.
This is all thanks to
Harper, because since she
both writes and performs
the piece, she is able to
present it authentically,
exactly as intended.
The way she naturally
communicates is so raw
and vulnerable; there is
a fascinating ‘stream of
consciousness’ feel to the
whole thing. Whilst it
was humour that engaged
the audience and kept us
listening, I’m sure we all
left having been touched
by themes that we could
relate to – loneliness,
struggle, fear, despera-
tion, resilience, courage,
and overcoming hurdles –
even if the exact situation
itself wasn’t shared by all.
At the end of the play,
Harper says a few words
about how the story is
inspired by a real woman
she met who shared her
experiences with postna-
tal mental health. To me,
this highlighted the very
real nature of the play,
and that the content was
not just entertainment,
but a wonderful starter for
meaningful conversations
about mental health.
Highly recommended!
Don Quixote – A Sizzling Spanish Comedy
D
on Quixote is
a sumptuous
delve into
Spain through
Miguel de Cervante’s
classic story. It follows
the eccentric Don who,
through reading too many
old tales, believes he is
a knight and goes out
seeking adventure with
his faithful squire Sancho.
Their misadventures
involve helping young
lovers Kitri and Basilio
evade Lorenzo (her
father) and Gamache
(the proposed suitor). It’s
hardly smooth sailing for
the pair, but all ends well
in an impressive final
wedding scene.
Carlos Acosta’s daring
new choreography for
the Royal Ballet was
introduced in 2013
alongside the fantastic
score by Ludwig Minkus.
The sumptuous music
transports you to the
Mediterranean and was
wonderfully conducted on
the night by Martin Yates.
Acosta wished to show off
the full cast in this large-
scale ballet, so alongside
the traditional solos and
pas de deux, there are
many marvellous group
sections for the corps de
ballet.
Throughout the night
it was a delight to watch
Kitri (Marianela Nuñez)
and Basilio (Vadim Mun-
tagirov). Both gave truly
outstanding performances
with great characterisation
and impressive technique.
Nuñez perfectly achieved
the remarkable 32 fouettés
in Act III, travelling en
pointe, escalating grand
jetés and effortlessly held
the many balances. All
this whilst lighting up the
audience with her radiant
smile. Muntagirov caused
the audience to gasp with
his remarkable split leaps,
displayed impressive
pirouettes and jumps,
and conveyed elegance in
every moment.
The level of trust and
togetherness shown by
the pair was revealed in
the final pas de deux, with
the incredibly difficult
‘fish dives’ seemingly
effortless.
Alongside them were
a number of standout
performances. Kitri’s
cheery friends, played by
Yuhui Choe and Beatriz
Stix-Brunell, pulled off
the difficult pas de deux.
Laura Morera portrayed
a delightfully flirtatious
Mercedes alongside
Ryoichi Hirano’s arrogant
Espada. During the
dream sequence of Act
II, Fumi Kaneko made
the complex routine as
Queen of the Dryads seem
effortless with delightful
extensions, and Anna
Rose O’Sullivan provided
a wonderfully exuberant
Amour.
Another highlight was
brought by the corps de
ballet in the gypsy scene
at the start of Act II – the
more contemporary reper-
toire delightfully brought
it to life.
This performance
requires just as much
talented acting as it does
dancing. In this vein Don
Quixote (Christopher
Saunders), Sancho Panza
(David Yudes), Lorenzo
(Gary Avis) and Gamache
(Bennet Gartside) are
brilliantly performed,
bringing real moments
of comedy to the stage.
Yudes in particular had
wonderful comedic
timing.
At times Acosta’s
ambitious choreography
can leave the stage feeling
crowded, with almost
too many things to see
at once. This combined
with Tim Hatley’s moving
set, although beautifully
setting the scene, can
at times be distracting.
However, despite these
things, it is a brilliant
move in modern ballet,
reenergising the perceived
stiffness of classical
ballets.
This vibrant and highly
comedic production,
combined with the
amazing talent of Nuñez
and Muntagirov is defi-
nitely one not to miss.
