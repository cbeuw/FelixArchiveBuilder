A
s LGBT
History Month
draws to a
close, National
Student Pride (NSP), the
UK’s largest LGBT+
careers fair, holds its
annual conference at the
UniversityofWestminster.
NSP brings a vibrant
mix of graduate careers
fairs, conferences,
debates, cinema screen-
ings, parties, exhibitions,
and workshops to London.
This weekend sees the
return of the three-day
‘extravaganza’, which
hosts over 1700 students
from 170 global univer-
sities. The event is also
available online via live
stream. NSP consistently
motivates young queer
people to engage with
challenges facing our
community, furthermore
providing attendants with
the unmissable opportu-
nity to access the UK’s
biggest LGBTQ+ careers
fair.
Signature moments
from NSP’s rich history
include Courtney Act
(Big Brother and Ru Pauls
Drag Race) host ‘queer
dates’, Olly Alexander
tackling sex education
and declaring that, “we
still grow up in a society
where we’re told that
we’re ‘othered’ as LGBT
people”, and Will Young
colourfully calling out
key government ministers
on mental health.
The Saturday main-
stage at NSP 2019, in col-
laboration with Attitude
Magazine, will be com-
bating the issue of preju-
dice within the LGBTQI+
community and getting to
grips with what it means
to be an activist with the
‘50 Years of Stonewall’
panel. Continuing to
engage with important
issues, the Gay Star stage
will be discussing the
“+” in LGBTQ+, and
explore Student Sexwork
to understand how we can
provide better support to
our peers. And what better
way to end the weekend
as Student Pride take
over the world-renowned
G-A-Y Heaven Saturday
Night, following up all
the fun with a queer bus
tour of London with some
of the city’s hottest drag
talent.
Keep a lookout for
announcements on who
will be gracing National
Student Pride as panellists
to, as always, provide in-
formation and inspiration
as to how we can move
forward as a community.
Without a doubt, NSP
2019 is going to animate
some pretty crucial con-
versation.
National Student Pride
is being platinum-spon-
sored in 2017 by EY for
the seventh consecutive
year. Maggie Stilwell,
Managing Partner for
Talent at EY, UK &
Ireland, comments:
“EY are proud to be the
Platinum sponsor for
National Student Pride
2017, a partnership we
have built and maintained
for the last seven years.
The UK’s largest LGBT+ careers fair and conference // Student Pride
Our commitment to
diversity and inclusion
is unerring and the event
allows us to connect with
young LGBT talent in an
environment of respect
and opportunity. It’s im-
portant for us to show the
next generation that they
will be able to be them-
selves in the workplace.
Last year thousands of
the students from across
the UK attended the event
and we are excited to meet
even more in February at
the Careers Fair. We look
forward to the whole
weekend festival of
events, including the ever
popular series of discus-
sions.”
Law firm Clifford
Chance and 02 are gold
sponsors. The Adidas
Group, Aviva, Enterprise
Rent-a-car, GE Capital,
IBM, Lloyds Banking
Group and Thomson
Reuters are silver
sponsors.
The event began at
Oxford Brookes Univer-
sity in 2005 as a response
to the Christian Union’s
‘Homosexuality and the
Bible’ talk. Student Pride
continues this mantra in
its 12th year, choosing
to hold its 2017 event on
campus because the fight
students face remains just
as prevalent, if not more
complex, than when we
first began.
