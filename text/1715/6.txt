The Labour defections - a Tory perspective
Politics writer Calum Drysdale argues that the last thing the Tories should do about the
Labour defections is crow.

O
n Monday
seven Labour
MPs announced
that they were
leaving the Labour party
in protest at Jeremy
Corbyn’s leadership
and his refusal to act on
anti-Semitism present
within the party. This has
drawn inevitable com-
parisons with the Social
Democrat Party, a group
of four former ministers
who resigned in 1981, in
response to the Labour
party’s shift to the left. The
SDP has long been a scare
story in British politics for
those considering setting
up their own party. While
they managed to gain
25% of the vote in 1983
they gained only 23 MPs
and the party ended up
merging with the Liberal
Party to form the Liberal
Democrats.
The #LabourSplit has
drawn comment from
the more twitter-minded
of Tory supporters who
have indulged in some
heavy schadenfreude.
They should not be so
quick and should look to
the keeping of their own
house before they stir
elsewhere. While the
seven MPs, now styled
as “The Independent
Group” are, with the
exception of Chuka
Umunna and Luciana
Berger, not well known
to the general public,
most of them have
held shadow cabinet
positions. In the games
of Westminster their
actions could be the start
of something far greater
than a new SDP.
The society we live
in now is far less class
stratified than it was in
the early 80’s. While
wealth disparity has
grown, studies have
shown that the manual
or lower-paid social
bracket has shrunk
enormously with 81%
of Britons employed in
service work in 2011.
This makes the old
models for political
parties and their raisons
d’être outdated. Labour
was meant to represent
the workers while
the Tories fought for
the middle and upper
classes. These divisions
are no longer relevant as
Brexit has shown time
and time again.
This is why the Inde-
pendent Group may just
be more than just a flash
in the pan. Only one
Conservative MP ended
up joining the SDP. Con-
sidering the time period,
while Thatcher was
waning in relevance and
popularity she still went
on to run the country for
another nine years. The
Tory party of today, a
spectrum of Brexiteers
and Remainers of every
shade, is a far cry from
that age of relative unity.
The constant Brexit
votes have made a
mockery of whipping
(ensuring that MPs
follow a party line) as
MPs vote time and again
against their parties, ac-
quiring a taste for rebel-
lion. This has allowed
centrist MPs, walking
through the lobbies of
the House of Commons,
to spot those other
members from across
the aisle whose liberal,
urban politics line up
significantly better with
their own than those of
other party members
and critically, their party
leadership.
Theresa May is not
Margaret Thatcher,
she does not command
the respect or loyalty
of her MPs. Now that
the first step has been
taken by others I would
not be surprised if Tory
Remainers fling off
the millstone necklace
of the Tory brand and
look for something that
offers them a way out of
the current mess.
“May is not
Thatcher-
she does not
command
the respect of
loyalty of her
MPs”
