A Clockwork Orange: 50 years on.
FILM

N
early 50 years
since its initial
releasein1971,
A Clockwork
Orange is being released
again for the big screen.
For 27 years it was next
to impossible to watch it
here in the UK after it was
banned from being shown
in cinemas in 1973, with
several court hearings
blaming the actions of
some criminals partly
on the violent nature
of the film. In the US,
however, it was critically
acclaimed. Watching it
now in 2019 I can see why.
It is beautifully theatrical,
more so than almost any
other film I have ever
watched; the theatre of
the cinematography, the
direction and the acting
is breathtaking. The film
is narrated throughout
by a guy called Alex,
who has a zeal for the
ultra violence. He lives
in a dystopian Britain in
the 1980s, spending his
evenings with his three
“droogs”: Georgie, Dim
and Pete, drinking drug
infused “milk-plus” and
going around partaking in
a bit of the old in out and
ultra violence. The way
these scenes are portrayed
is why this film was pulled
from British screens in the
70s and didn’t return until
1999.
Throughout the film
there is a healthy serving
of violence, slimy poli-
ticians, dodgy probation
officers and a lot of
dicks; maybe a few too
many to be perfectly
honest, though they do
add a good helping of
immature comedy to the
film. Yet one thing which
sticks out even more than
lollipop penises is the use
of music throughout the
film. The way music is
used is nothing short of
masterful; from making
a threesome amusing, to
adding even more drama
to fight scenes. To the pro-
tagonist, Alex, music is
also incredibly important
as he has a deep love for
Ludwig van Beethoven,
something Kubrick uses
throughout; not only as
a plot device, but also to
deliver specific political
and moral messages.
Even though this film
wasmadenearly5decades
ago it remains incredibly
relevant. Violence and
crime in today’s society
is just as problematic and
disruptive as it was 50
years ago, and politicians
are still being manipula-
tive and ‘doing their best’
for the people. Fashion
and technology have
moved on a bit, and so has
medical testing, I would
hope, but the underlying
messages about morality
and politics are just as
relevant today as they
were when the film was
made, and when the book
it is based on was written.
This, along with the
fantastic acting, directing
and script, is what makes
this such a classic film. I’d
argue.that 50 year’s on,
Kubrick’s A Clockwork
Orange is a film which has
yet to be surpassed.
I highly recommend
watching it, not at home
on an iPad or laptop, but
on the big screen with
popcorn in your lap and
a drink at your side. This
is truly where this film
belongs and thankfully
due to its re-release you
will have that opportu-
nity. Something I would
like to point out is that
some people may leave
around halfway through
as they believe the film
is going to become ‘even
more violent’ however,
this is not the case, and
it calms down in the
second half. This is also
where Kubrick ties the
whole film together with
underlying messages,
as well as where my
favourite character is
introduced, Barnes (the
chief prison guard), who
has a hilarious manner
about him, and is very
old school British. In the
second half there is also
the best prison scene I
have ever seen in a film,
better than anything from
Shawshank, the highest
regarded film ever (and
that was set in its entirety
in a prison!) As films go,
this is one of the best; the
acting, directing, sound
and costume design are
unparalleled and work
really well together,
unlike some films released
recently.
