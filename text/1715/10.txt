T
his isn’t what I
expected recov-
ery to look like.
For over ten
years, I’ve battled with
an eating disorder, and
I’m starting to realise that
seems like it’s a dynamic
process, with an equilibri-
um that shifts left or right
depending on the environ-
ment. I suppose it says a
lot that my inclination is to
imagine it as an A-Level
chemistry problem, but
that’s Imperial for you. I
always knew that therapy
would be hard, and ad-
justing to life after therapy
would be difficult, but I
wasn’t prepared when I
was knocked by a death in
the family. I was so sure I
was winning the war until
I turned my back to focus
on something else.
The enemy came into
my territory, and I retreat-
ed back to the restriction I
knew best. For a while it
was almost nostalgic, the
familiar hazy head of star-
vation dulled my sadness
and made the grief softer;
the same purpose it has
served for my anxiety and
complacent. Skipping
breakfast here and there
didn’t feel dangerous,
I was using the logic:
“Healthy people do that all
the time and I’m healthy
now too!”. It turns out
that all I was doing was
tempting the beast to rear
it’s ugly head.
Everyone around me
got used to me being okay
too, so the thought of
coming clean about this
is terrifying. I fear the day
people will get bored of
theviciouscycleofrelapse
and recovery, rolling their
eyes because “aren’t you
done with that all yet?”.
It also feels somewhat
insincere to admit that
this is still a thing. That
all this time, even when
things have been good,
I have had thoughts like
“my friends don’t want
to see me today because
I’m fat.”, “That interview
didn’t go well because
I’m fat.”, “I deserved to
be groped by that creep on
the tube because I’m fat.”.
It’s embarrassing to reveal
this level of nonsense
going on in my brain, and
that I’ve succumbed to it
again. Logically I know
that none of these things
are related to being fat.
The fact that I am far from
any definition of fat is
besides the point. I am also
wary of people pitying
me, or being repelled by
my absurdity. I wonder if
I’ll be subject to the same
type of judgement and
misunderstanding that I
react to other maladaptive
coping mechanisms with.
“Why doesn’t he just
stop drinking alcohol? He
knows it’s not a healthy
way to deal with his
problems”.
I have relapsed before,
but all I have to hold onto
is that each successive
knock is easier to deal
with. Fighting my way
through every stumble is
like training my army to
be able to respond quicker
when it finds itself on the
back foot, or building up
a buffer solution to keep
“The fact that
I am far from
any definition
of fat is
besides the
point”
things stable when my
environment becomes
sour. Or so I tell myself,
anyway.
