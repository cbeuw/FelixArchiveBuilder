campus...

W
hat comes
to mind
when you
see the word
‘brunch’? Probably a
bunchofmillennialseating
crunchy avocado toast,
Insta-worthy smoothie
açai bowls or stacks of
warm waffles (drizzled
with maple syrup and
topped with fresh summer
berries of course), and all
of this costing you lots
and lots of £££.
Although that may be
a part of it, brunch can
also be a nice treat for you
and your friends to enjoy
on any day of the week,
(right before that boooring
lecture) and super close
to campus as well! We
therefore present you 3
places to have brunch near
campus, all no more than
an 8 minute walk away
from campus!
Muriel’s Kitchen
Located just outside
South Ken station, this
place is always hustling
and bustling (what better
marker of a food venue’s
popularity, right?), and
after peeking in and
seeing the delicious plate
of croissants that was
being consumed at the
cute marble-style tables,
I knew I had to go in
and try it. Judging by the
youthful presence, I was
sure that the food served
here was not your simple
brunch. I was right –
Muriel’s Kitchen provides
everything you could
want for brunch with a
modern twist. Particular
things that caught my eye
included The Ultimate
Eggs Royale, Banana &
Ricotta Pancakes, and
the omnipresent Buddha
Bowl which I ended up
ordering and very much
enjoying (is it me, or are
they absolutely every-
where?!).
And don’t worry about
drinks – from their classic
ice cream milkshakes
“I was sure
that the food
served here
was not your
average simple
brunch. I was
right...”
“Best of all, all
the breakfast
foods fall in
the price range
of £4.20 - £8.00
- win-win!”
and fresh juices to more
unique beverages such as
the turmeric latte, you’ll
surely find something to
complement your meal.
The counter also has an
array of warm, freshly
baked homemade cakes,
including banana bread,
Nutella cake or their
special carrot cake. Prices
range from £2.30 for a
pastry with spreads to
£12.50 for a Full English
– by brunch standards,
pretty good. (Oh, and if
you’re interested in all
that basic bitch stuff, they
do a lovely afternoon tea
too!)
Brown & Rosie
Walking past Brown
& Rosie on my many,
many trips to campus
(skipping lectures is of
course not recommended
by Felix Food editors…
unless they’re 9ams), I
was always fascinated
by the classy but cute
décor, not to mention
the mouth-watering food
from their Instagram ads
that I’ve been getting ever
since I once liked a post
marked #brunch (GDPR
anyone?). On a lovely day
last week, I finally got the
chance to see if the food
lived up to the aesthetics.
Again, the variety was not
disappointing – apart from
classics such as French
toast or smoked salmon,
you can also find the
sugary Coco Pop waffles
(personally tried and
tested – although extreme-
ly sweet, also extremely
yummy!) or the healthier
courgette & corn fritters,
if you so desire (new year
new me going strong?).
The taste was also lived
up to the aesthetic – rich,
well-made and well, good.
Albeit priciest on our list,
you can find yourself a
meal for £5.50 to £12.90,
and the portions are very
filling. The only things
worth complaining about
are the size of the venue,
as it can get busy at times,
and the semi-slow service
– but the food is good
enough to compensate, so
definitely worth a visit.
Le Pain Quotidien
Finally, after having
tried some less ‘typical’
brunch places, it was time
to test a more popular
venue. Le Pain Quotidien,
as the name suggests, (for
those of you who don’t
speak French, t’as pas
honte) is largely known
for its selection of fresh
bread, pastries, sandwich-
es and all that kind of
yummy carbs, in its chain-
café-style locations, the
nearest of which is located
just a minute away from
South Ken station (and
actually opposite Brown
& Rosie). Having heard a
friend raving about it after
she had eaten brunch there
just recently, I thought
it was worth a try. The
outcome? Incredible.
Besides their usual
eat-in omelette, eggs any
style, smoothie bowl,
or parfait options, you
can also order takeaway
bagels, salmon and cream
cheese tartine or even
avocado toast for when
you’re rushed for time.
Yes, you read that right –
delightful avocado toast
which you can take away,
all carefully packaged in a
box so you can eat it in the
back of the lecture theatre
(if you manage to make
it last those 7 minutes
of walking). Best of all,
Wthe breakfast foods fall
in the price range of £4.20
to £8.00 – win win!
The lowdown?
Although the food is
the simplest in LPQ, it
definitely takes the gold
in terms of affordabil-
ity and ease. If you’re
looking for something
a bit more original and
Instagrammable (and you
have a bit more time), go
for Muriel’s Kitchen or
Brown & Rosie – they’re
worth it.
Now let me enjoy my
Eggs Benedict in peace...
