Not yet (bothered to be) recycled
F
rom crisps to
coke, and pears
to pizzas, almost
everything we
buy today is wrapped,
boxed or bottled in plas-
tic. Disposable packaging
is, by definition, used just
once yet, according to
the government recycling
agency WRAP, they make
up 40% of all plastic used
in the UK. A key part to
changing this is a change
in culture, particularly
around food packaging.
We need to cut back on
our individual consump-
tion of plastics.
Plastics used for pack-
aging primarily are made
from virgin material.
This is particularly true
of plastic films which
are largely made from
polypropylene (plastic no
5) and polythene. Despite
packets their characteris-
tic crackle. If it crackles,
it can’t recycled.
Plastic packaging has
brought many benefits.
It is used by retailers for
good reason to prolong
the lifetime of foods and
to protect products. They
are light, cheap, food-safe
materials, and arguably
help prevent food waste
and fuel in transportation.
However, they are being
used excessively for the
purposes of increasing
appeal to consumers.
This excess is causing
serious harm to economic
and environmental sus-
tainability. Plastic is not
a renewable resource
– globally its production
consumes 8% of oil
extracted - 4% for the
raw material, and 4% in

In the UK, 10.9 million
tonnes of plastic are
used for packaging each
year. That’s over half
a kilogram per person
each day. Some of this is
hidden behind the scenes
in transportation between
production facilities or in
the kitchens at restaurants.
Yet regardless of where
it is used, the key point
is that, as a society, we
consume too much of it.
We choose, by buying
cheap products with
disposable packaging,
to send around a half
of plastic to landfill. It
will stand as a testament
of our wastefulness for
generations to come. The
largest structures which
our species have built are
not walls nor pyramids,
but landfills (Fresh Kills
Landfill in New York).
One might struggle to
design a more optimal
matter how much plastic
we use if it is recycled?
Sadly, recycling is not
a satisfactory solution.
Firstly, at present, much of
packaging used is virgin
and has to be because
of the poor quality
of recycled material.
Secondly, the Second
Law of Thermodynamics
tells us we will never be
able to recover all of the
plastic. Recycling bins are
not magical alchemical
cauldrons.
52% of plastic sent for
recycling in the UK meets
its fate in an incinerator.
Recycling is far better
than landfill, however it
does give a false sense of
security. It does not close
the loop in our economy
and causes other issues
such as air pollution.
Besides, much of the
plastic which is recycled
is exported to less wealthy
countries where waste
processing regulation is
less stringent.
Within our personal
lives, there are changes
we can make to reduce
our dependence on pack-
aging. For one, avoid food
packaged in materials
not recycled in our area.
Secondly, make use of
our own containers. If
we bring reusable con-
tainers to shops we could
significantly cut back on
waste production. The
blossoming of coffee
mugs from the rucksacks
of students at the college
since the introduction of
the 25p levy on coffee
cups are testament to this.

But surely it does not
outlets including the
Tuesday farmers’ market
have already agreed to
serve food in containers
brought by customers.
Some supermarkets and
smaller enterprises, such
as Whole Foods, Eat 17
in Hammersmith and
the Imperial Co-op (see
above) have refill stations
for nuts, pulses, beans
and cereals which bypass
use of plastic for pantry
essentials.
Government could do
more to prevent plastic
from going to landfill.
Eight EU countries,
including Germany,
Switzerland and the
Netherlands, have banned
disposing of plastic in
landfill, ensuring all waste
is recycled or used for
energy generation.
We do not have a
choice about whether
we stop using oil-based
plastic as, eventually, we
will run out of affordable
crude oil. Let’s use this
incredible material a bit
more resourcefully.
