Can machine learning predict ovarian cancer survival?
Machine learning software can lead the way towards more personalised medicine, predicting patient outcomes
with significantly more accuracy than current methods

“The software
was four times
more accurate
for predicting
deaths than
standard
methods”
R
esearchers at
ImperialCollege
London and the
University of
Melbourne have created
new machine learning
software that can forecast
the survival rates and
response to treatments
of patients with ovarian
cancer.
The software has been
able to predict the progno-
sis of patients with ovarian
cancer significantly more
accurately than current
methods. It can also
predict what treatment
would be most effective
for patients following
diagnosis, paving the way
for more personalised
medicine.
Ovarian cancer is
the sixth most common
cancer in women, with
6,000 new cases every
year in the UK. However,
the long-term survival
rate is just 35-40 per cent,
as the disease is often only
diagnosed in later stages
once symptoms such as
bloating are noticeable.
Professor Eric
Aboagye, lead author and
Professor of Cancer Phar-
macology and Molecular
Imaging at Imperial, said:
“There is an urgent
need to find new ways
to treat the disease. Our
technology is able to give
clinicians more detailed
and accurate information
on how patients are likely
to respond to different
treatments, which could
enable them to make
better and more targeted
treatment decisions.”
Doctors currently
diagnose ovarian cancer
in a number of ways:
including a blood test to
look for a substance called
CA125 – an indication of
cancer - followed by a
CT scan that uses x-rays
and a computer to create
detailed pictures of the
ovarian tumour. This
helps clinicians know
how far the disease has
spread and determines the
type of treatment patients
receive, such as surgery
and chemotherapy.
However, the scans
cannot give clinicians
detailed insight into
patients’ likely overall
outcomes or the probable
effect of a therapeutic
intervention. The new
software aims to address
these problems.
The trial used a math-
ematical software tool
called TEXLab to identify
the aggressiveness of
tumours in CT scans and
tissue samples from 364
women with ovarian
cancer between 2004 and
2015. It examined four bi-
ological characteristics of
the tumours which signif-
icantly influence overall
survival - structure,
shape, size and genetic
makeup - to assess the
patients’ prognosis. The
patients were then given a
score known as Radiomic
Prognostic Vector (RPV)
which indicates how
severe the disease is.
The researchers then
compared the results with
blood tests and current
prognostic scores used
by doctors to estimate
survival probability. They
found that the software
was up to four times more
accurate for predicting
deaths from ovarian
cancer than standard
methods.
The hope, therefore,
is that the technology
can be used to stratify
ovarian cancer patients
into groups based on the
subtle differences in the
texture of their cancer on
CT scans, rather than clas-
sification based on what
type of cancer they have
or how advanced it is.
The team also found
that five per cent of
patients with high RPV
scores had a life expect-
ency of less than two
years. High RPV was also
associated with chemo-
therapy resistance and
poor surgical outcomes,
suggesting that RPV can
be used as a potential
biomarker to predict how
patients would respond to
treatments.
The researchers are
also planning to carry out
a larger study to see how
accurately the software
can predict the outcomes
of surgery and drug
therapies for individual
patients, adding further
powerful tools for doctors
to use.
Lack of sleep is not necessarily fatal for flies
New research has found that the life expectency of flies are barely affected by sleep deprivation - could the same
be true for humans?

ale flies kept
awake do not
die earlier
than those
allowed to sleep, leading
researchers to question
whether sleep is essential
for staying alive. Whilst
this study was in flies,
the team speculate that
if sleep is not essential
for life in the same way
food is, then it is possible
that their results could
apply across the animal
kingdom - including in
humans.
They also found that
female flies die on average
only three days earlier out
of a 40-50 day average
lifespan.
Dr Giorgio Gilestro,
from the Department of
Life Sciences at Imperial,
said: “For food, we have
calories that are ‘vital’ to
keep us alive and calories
that are ‘useful’ to help us
function well. It might be
that sleep is only ‘useful’:
it would still be difficult
for us to function without
it, but not necessarily
fatal.”
Previous experiments
have shown that some
animals die when deprived
of sleep, but the studies
are unclear about exactly
why this is. The research-
ers behind the new study,
published in Science
Advances, suggest that
the way the experiments
were run could mean the
animals died of stress due
to the methods of keeping
them awake.
To keep the flies awake,
the researchers kept each
fly in a tube linked to an
automatic monitoring
system. If the system
detected no movement for
20 seconds, then the tube
rotated, waking the fly
up. This system allowed
the team to experiment
with hundreds of flies at
once, giving them a better
understanding of the
average response to sleep
deprivation.
The researchers note
that while male flies did
not die earlier without
sleep under lab conditions,
in the wild lack of sleep
would cause knock-on
effects that would put
them at greater risk from
predators or competition.
Dr Gilestro added:
“Lack of sleep could make
it hard for them to function
properly and safely, just
as a lack of sleep might
cause a sleep-deprived
human to crash their car.”
“It’s not that there are
no consequences to not
sleeping, but our study
has made us question
whether sleep deprivation
alone causes death.”
During their exper-
iments, the team also
found that, even while
sleep deprived, the
flies followed ‘normal’
patterns of activity. Flies
are usually more active at
dawn and dusk, and even
when they hadn’t had any
sleep for many days in a
row, this was still the case.
The researchers say this
shows that the flies are not
building up a ‘sleep debt’-
they do not necessarily get
sleepier the longer they
stay awake, but keep to
relatively normal patterns
of activity. This suggests
the pressure to sleep is
controlled more strongly
by the time or day than by
the amount of sleep taken.
This was further shown
when flies that had been
deprived were allowed to
sleep again. They slept
a little longer for a day
or two but returned to
normal patterns quickly,
instead of immediately
catching up on all the
sleep they had lost with
one extremely long sleep.
Future experiments will
continue to investigate
the effects of sleep dep-
rivation on flies’ mental
performance.
The return of British rockets

n a dark and spacious
room, with upbeat
music accompanying
a blue-lit bar, a crowd
was gathering to await
the latest product reveal
from a hot British start-
up. As the CEO took the
stage, they were ushered
to their seats, and a mass
of cameras turned to face
him. After an enthusiastic
speech, he turned with
a flourish as the curtain
behind him dropped to
reveal the sleek black
shape of… a rocket.
British start-up Orbex
has revealed new flight
hardware at the opening
of their production facility
in Forres, Scotland. The
upper stage rocket which
was revealed is part of the
company’s Prime launch
vehicle, which is set to
become the first Brit-
ish-built rocket to launch
to space in 50 years. The
event featured speeches
from the president of
the Royal Aeronautical
Society, Scottish partners,
and the head of the UK
Space Agency, who noted
a predicted 30,000 new
jobs in the industry over
the next 10 years. Imperial
College Space Society
(previously ICSEDS) was
also represented at the
event, receiving a mention
from CEO Chris Larmour.
Presenters stressed the
importance and strength
of the UK space industry,
the new opportunities
afforded by recent tech-
nological breakthroughs,
and the rise of commercial
launch companies world-
wide.
The small-satellite
movement, which favours
multiple cheap satellites
as a replacement for larger
conventional ones, has
finally made it to the UK.
With uncertainty about
the future relationship
with European launch
providers, the UK gov-
ernment is keen to support
homegrown launch ca-
pability. Orbex is one of
several start-ups looking
to capitalise on this new
opportunity, but is the first
to demonstrate full-scale
hardware.
Prime features the
most powerful 3D printed
engine ever built, as
well as an innovative
propellant tank system
that Orbex claims reduces
the weight of the rocket
by approximately 30%.
The rocket also sports
the largest payload bay
size of any in its class,
which Orbex says will
be attractive to satellite
operators. The rocket
runs on bio-propane and
liquid oxygen, reducing
the carbon footprint of a
launch, and will feature a
rapid de-orbiting system
to reduce its contribution
to space junk. When
completed, it is expected
to launch from the new
Scottish spaceport in
Sutherland, and will
compete with similar
small launchers such as
Rocket Labs’ Electron.
Launch services are
expected to commence in
2021.
Imperial College Space
Society is supported by
Orbex, receiving funds
for our aerospace design
projects including high
powered rocketry and
rocket engine design.
The society also runs
guest lectures and Q&A
sessions with researchers
and companies at the
leading edge of this new
era in space.
