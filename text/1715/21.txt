A
part from
creating the
Windows 95
start-up sound,
Brian Eno is perhaps best
known for pioneering the
genre of ‘ambient music’,
where extended instru-
mental compositions
slowly loop and bubble,
creating soundscapes that
are intricate yet discreet.
His work in this area went
on to directly inspire art-
ists such as Aphex Twin,
William Basinski, and
Tim Hecker. Long before
this, however, Eno was
doing something really
quite different.
His musical career
began in 1970, though not
as a musician, when he
joined groundbreaking art
rock band Roxy Music as
a ‘technical advisor’. He’d
known founder member
Andy Mackay from their
days in art school where
the two hand bonded
over their shared love
of electronic music, and
so when Mackay joined
forces with singer Bryan
Ferry, he convinced Eno
to come aboard. It was an
odd appointment, as Eno
played no instruments
and had absolutely no
musical experience. What
he did bring to the table,
however, was a reel-to-
reel tape recorder and a
eye for experimentation.
Before long, Eno
became an integral part
of the band. Their debut
album Roxy Music (1972)
was a genre-blending
landmark of creativity,
fusing glam, prog, and
pop to form a symphonic
whirlwind of an LP. A
constant advocate for
the avant-garde, Eno’s
influence was strong; he
contributed synthesisers
and tape effects that gave
their music an other-
worldly quality. On stage
he was a wizard. Cutting
and manipulating tapes to
distort their sound in real
time. This, along with his
flamboyant feather boas,
garnered him much atten-
tion, despite never taking
centre stage. His presence
was only amplified on
their second album For
Your Pleasure (see Felix
issue 1686), particularly
on the eerie and dystopian
closing track.
“It was here
that he first
challenged
the norm and
probed what it
really meant to
make music”
their experimental artistry.
Following their second
album, White Light/White
Heat, the tensions became
too great, and Cale was
acrimoniously given the
boot.
It is fitting, or perhaps
ironic, therefore, that
Roxy Music nigh on
exactly replicated the path
carved by their idols.After
just two albums, dashing
crooner Ferry began to
tire of Eno the bohemian
stealing the limelight, and
wanted to take the band
in more conventional
directions. Resistant to
this change, Eno departed
citing creative differ-
ences, leaving Ferry the
dominant force. While
both Roxy and the Velvets
continued to produce very
fine music without their
respective renegades,
it is certainly arguable
that something of their
original creative flair
was lost. Coincidentally,
though not unsurprisingly,
Eno and Cale would later
go on to become firm
friends and collaborators,
even recording an album
together, 1990’s Wrong
Way Up.
Free of restrictions,
Eno allowed his creative
tendencies to run wild.
His debut solo album
Here Come the Warm
Jets was released in
January 1974, though it
was anything but solo in
nature. A thread that was
to run through the rest of
his career, Eno enlisted
a whole host of collab-
orators, including all
members of Roxy Music
(bar Ferry), and King
Crimson guitarist Robert
Fripp, with whom he had
recently recorded the
experimental noisescape
(No Pussyfooting). Re-
cording techniques were
as unconventional as you
would imagine, with Eno
often directing musicians
to swap instruments, or
giving instructions solely
through the medium of
dance. For those who
know Brian Eno only for
his ambient work, the
initial shockwave hits
immediately in the form
of a throbbing distorted
guitar. Shortly afterwards,
we find out that Eno can
sing. And boy, can he
sing! The first side is
frenetic and high-octane.
With conventional song
structures out the window,
hooks and choruses are in
short supply, while feed-
back-driven instrumentals
(notably Fripp’s sublime
guitar work on ‘Baby’s
On Fire’) are aplenty.
Cryptic lyrics act more
as impressionistic word
decorations than narrative
devices, with Eno’s voice
veering between distant
drones and staccato snarls.
As the noise of sinister
nursery rhyme ‘Driving
Me Backwards’ draws to
a close, we hit a change
of gear. The piano-led
ballad ‘On Some Faraway
Beach’ is by far the most
tender moment on the LP,
its simplistic yet evocative
lyrics (“Unlikely I’ll be
remembered / as the tide
brushes sand in my eyes /
I’ll drift away”) ushering
in an unexpected moment
of clarity and vulnerabil-
ity. Following this prec-
edent, the second side is
musically lighter, favour-
ing synths over guitars.
It’s here that we can see
the seeds of his minimalist
approach begin to germi-
nate, though it wouldn’t
sport its first flower until
Discreet Music, just short
of two years later.
Here Come the Warm
Jets is a peculiar yet ex-
traordinary stepping stone
in Eno’s career. It was here
that he first challenged
the norm and probed
what it really meant to
make music, the resulting
album being more akin to
a Dadaist vignette than
a pop-rock record. After
a string of ever more
experimental solo albums,
he soon found himself
engaging in landmark
collaborations with David
Bowie and Talking Heads,
and behind the boards
producing for the likes of
Devo, U2, and Coldplay
(we all make mistakes).
His gargantuan influence
on the musical landscape
really cannot be understat-
ed, and he’s still churning
a regular output to this
day. Seemingly without
even trying, everything he
touches turns to gold.
Brian? What does‘e know?! // Island
Frontman Bryan Ferry
(along with just about
everyone who knew them)
drew much inspiration
from 60s proto-punk band
the Velvet Underground.
The story of their early
days is one of a great
power struggle and fierce
rivalry between two
extraordinary musicians.
Vocalist and primary
songwriter Lou Reed
was, for the most part, a
straight forward NewYork
rock and roll type with
insatiable charisma. By
contrast, fellow bandmate
John Cale was a reclusive
viola-playing Welshman.
The two grappled to take
the band in different di-
rections. Reed, frustrated
by their lack of commer-
cial success, wanted to
pull them towards the
mainstream, while Cale
sought to further nourish
