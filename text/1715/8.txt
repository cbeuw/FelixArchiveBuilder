L
iam Neeson,
whilst promoting
his latest film,
described a story
of how a friend of his had
been raped by a black
man and how, following
this, he wanted to kill a
black man to avenge his
friend. This is undeniably
racist; he saw black men
as indistinguishable and,
therefore, killing any
black man would do. This
plays into a wider narra-
tive of black people, men
in particular, being viewed
as aggressive, violent and
savage criminals. Sadly,
these kinds of views are
far more common than
they should be and, whilst
there has been progress,
it has been painstakingly
slow. A key question that
we need to answer is what
to do when confronted
with these individuals?
Neeson has been
widely condemned for
having held these views,
and rightly so. Any form
of racism needs to be
challenged. However,
there is a risk of forming
a mob mentality. This
incident happened 40
years ago and Neeson
has expressed his regret
for holding these views
and has made it clear he
does not hold them now.
It is essential that people
who have these views
can seek and obtain
redemption. The logical
consequence if we don’t
is a world in which a
significant minority of
the population is casti-
gated and excluded from
society with no hope of
truly participating in it.
What is the benefit of
trying to reform if you
know that you’ll still be
called racist over some-
thing you can no longer
do anything about?
These individuals’ views
will only harden and
persist, sewing further
division and hatred. Far
better is to have an open
dialogue about why
people hold these views
and ultimately why they
are wrong. This is a
process that Neeson has
probably gone through
considering he has since
changed his views but,
since he has made this
public, it would be good
for him to discuss the
journey he has been on.
There is no obligation on
him to do so but, having
recognised the mistakes
that he has made, he is
in the perfect position
to help others take the
same steps. We should
ultimately champion
individuals who are able
to better themselves
this way, not because
it is a desirable path to
take but as a beacon for
racists to show them
there is a way out of
their antiquated views
and into the 21st
century.
We can belligerently
scream at the top of our
lungs calling out racists
and the like but it’s im-
portant to understand the
social situation people
find themselves in.
Neeson grew up during
the troubles in Ireland
where, if a Catholic
were killed, revenge
would be taken by at-
tacking a member of the
Protestant community
regardless of whether
that individual was
involved or not. This
naturally doesn’t excuse
racist behaviour, but we
are all products of our
environments and to
bring about real change,
this is a fundamental
aspect that needs to be
addressed. What Neeson
said should be used as
an opportunity to talk
about the persecution
that ethnic minoritie,
and in particular black
men, still face today.
Even in the UK, the
system appears to be
stacked against them.
From rates of poverty
to harsher criminal
sentences to the court
of public opinion, black
men are often put at a
significant disadvantage
to their white counter-
parts. This is entrenched
in the UK system, going
back decades and will
take concerted effort to
change. The Windrush
scandal is a case in point.
It’s highly unlikely
that we would even be
having this problem if it
involved white migrants
rather than black.
An example of
where change should
be possible is Shannon
Gabriel, the West Indian
cricketer, who was
recently banned for four
matches for throwing
homophobic abuse in the
way of England’s cricket
captain, Joe Root. He
has since released a
letter explaining what
happened from his point
of view and how he
now recognises it was a
mistake. He will serve
his punishment and,
hopefully afterwards,
will never use that kind
of abuse on or off a
cricket pitch. I also hope
that he won’t be tar-
nished as homophobic
for the rest of his career
when he has shown clear
contrition for his hor-
rendous actions. Racists
should face justice in
whatever form; actions
should have conse-
quences. Beyond this,
they should have the
ability to be reintegrated
into society. Society has
a role for facilitating this
and a world in which
there are fewer racists
is a world we must all
aspire towards.
Those of us who are
liberal and fundamen-
tally believe that people
should be able to be who
they are, whether this is
to do with their sexual
orientation, religion,
ethnicity, etc., without
the risk of attack and
persecution will prevail
over bigotry. However,
we must be careful to
avoid being entirely
intolerant of intolerance
for we run the risk of
making a bad situation
worse. We live in a
deeply divided world
which can feel like a
powder keg ready to
explode. The only way
to bridge this growing
divide is through
dialogue and showing
that there is a path to
redemption.
