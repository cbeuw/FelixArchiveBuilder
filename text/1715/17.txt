The Justice Syndicate
I
n The Justice
Syndicate, an in-
teractive 12-person
game created by the-
atre company fanSHEN,
we’re on a jury deciding
the fate of a top paediatric
neurosurgeon who’s been
accused of sexual assault
by the mother of one of his
patients. It’s almost like 12
Angry Men when we walk
in: twelve desks arranged
in a rectangle, and at each
seat an iPad, notebook and
glass of water. Evidence
for the case – statements,
forensic reports, video
testimonies from both
sides, and expert opinions
– is revealed to us piece
by piece on the iPads as
we go along. Guilty or in-
nocent? We get to decide.
The evidence is
designed to be equiv-
ocal. There is a clear
power imbalance here:
Huxtable, a renowned
neurosurgeon, is clearly
socioeconomically better
off than Hodges, a strug-
gling single mother of
two. Though we might
wish for more conclusive
evidence, it just doesn’t
exist – much as in real
life, where hard evidence
in rape and sexual assault
cases is often lacking.
This makes it incredibly
difficult to decide. It’s
a his-word-against-hers
situation, but who is being
truthful and who is lying?
The tech syncing,
thanks to computational
artist Joe McAlister, is
great, with a slick inter-
face and voting results
displayed to everyone
instantaneously. Our
iPads are synced and
different witness state-
ments are read out by
different jurors – we all
get a chance to speak,
emboldening everyone
for the discussions later
on. Although I must say
I was glad it wasn’t my
iPad that lit up when it
was time to read out the
transcript of Huxtable’s
BDSM sexting…!
Midway through, we
are even offered the option
to bar one juror from the
final vote. My group,
which was fairly civil,
chose not to, but the threat
of elimination served to
deter any single individ-
ual from being overly
disruptive. The game
creators Dan Barnard
and Rachel Briscoe have
clearly put a lot of thought
into encouraging produc-
tive discussion amongst
participants, and it works.
Despite having never met
each other before, we’re
soon getting into excited
arguments about whether
or not Huxtable should be
convicted.
There are 3 opportu-
nities for us to vote on
which way we are leaning,
and one last discussion of
all the evidence before the
final decision of the jury
is handed down. Once
the verdict is out, Barnard
and Briscoe finally appear
to facilitate the post-game
debrief. After all the
tension of the last hour or
so, it’s time to clear the
air and for everyone to
hash out any unfinished
arguments. It’s another
excellent discussion – I
get into a small debate
with my neighbour about
how insufficient evidence
to convict isn’t the same as
not believing the victim.
Barnard and Briscoe also
take the time to point out
how social dynamics,
such as groupthink and
group polarisation, can
(and did) affect group
decision-making as well.
It’s quite illuminating
to think about our own
decision-making process
in retrospect and see how
these forces actually had
an influence in real life.
Before leaving, we’re
given a ‘newspaper’
with commentary from
the game creators, using
statistics from their first
15 sessions, to take home
and peruse at leisure. It’s a
fascinating read, showing
the radically different
conclusions that different
groups came to. Despite
the intentionally equivo-
cal evidence, individuals
were able to form very
strongly held opinions
on the guilt or innocence
of Huxtable. I noticed
this myself in our group
session; several people
were deeply convinced
that Huxtable was guilty.
When challenged as to
why, they simply said
they felt it “in their
hearts”. Was this borne
of a desire to protect the
underdog? A kind of
reverse-victim blaming?
An effect of the #MeToo
era that we now live in? I
found it strange and dis-
turbing how fallible the
jury system was, and how
much sway emotion held
over people’s supposedly
rational decisions.
Innovative and
exciting, The Justice Syn-
dicate is not only a fasci-
nating demonstration of
group dynamics, but also
a timely examination of
attitudes towards sexual
assault in the present
social climate.
Crime and Punishment: Czech Edition
K
atya Kabanova
could be
one of those
plots we have
heard a million times: a
woman avoids immoral-
ity, succumbs anyway
and punishes herself for
her actions. Unhappy
marriage, controlling
mother-in-law, lover with
family issues, friend who
nudges her into temp-
tation. What is unusual
about this particular story
is the intense focus on
Katya’s psychological
drama which, in stark
contrast with the other
characters’ lighthearted-
ness, only increases the
feeling of her tragedy. She
is a complex character, a
gentle soul in a difficult
situation and filled with
contrasting, violent
emotions. Singer Amanda
Majeski steps into her
shoes with breath-taking
intensity, making the
audience (literally) shake
with her during her mental
breakdown. Director
Richard Jones helps her
create this effect by clev-
erly employing his cast of
choir members and actors,
who fill the stage for or-
dinary life scenes, empty
it to emphasize Katya’s
solitude and finally fill it
with judging, disapprov-
ing eyes. Group scenes
do play a very important
role in the performance,
dynamically changing the
sets, introducing comical
elements and effectively
intensifying the drama by
adding an extra dimension
to the stage.
Although Majeski’s
extraordinary perfor-
mance in the title role was
clearly the highlight of
the opera, others are also
worth a mention. Emily
Edmons as Varvara and
Susan Bickley as Katya’s
tyrannical mother in law
were both brilliant in their
roles, one gaily praising
love and the other ped-
agogically instructing
a husband how to deal
with his wife. A low mark
goes to Pavel Cernoch,
whose beautiful singing
was poorly matched by
his acting, resulting in a
barely convincing male
lead. Finally, Dominic
Sedgwick proved he is
worth keeping an eye
out for. A participant in
ROH’s Young Artists
Programme, his short but
passionately energetic
interventions made me
eager to listen to more of
him in the future.
Like any good disciple
of the Romantic tradition,
Janaceck places a large
weight on symbols.
Natural elements, such as
a bird, the river Volga that
crosses the town where
the action takes place,
and the thunderstorm that
accompanies the fateful
upshot of the plot, all have
metaphorical significance.
The music which repre-
sents these elements is
also symbolic, providing
our ears with motifs that
our subconscious then
starts associating with
specific events. Often you
don’t really need to look
at the stage to know what
is going on, even without
knowing Czech! Particu-
lar to Janaceck’s style is
his treatment of dialogue.
His melodies result from
a thorough study of
speaking patterns, so that
rhythms and tones feel
natural and conversation-
al, informed by the mood
and emotional state of the
characters. The orches-
tration is very effective,
actively shaping the
action at every moment.
One of my favourite sets
was the end of the opera,
where a delicate, yet
disturbing off-stage choir
leads to a tragic orchestral
conclusion.
After all, this is no
regular plot. Janacek’s
dramatic and musical
mastery together with
clever staging and great
performances make
Katya Kabanova a ten-
sion-packed story of love,
crime and punishment.
