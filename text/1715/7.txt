Where is the line?
Amidst ever increasing living costs and in spite of their huge surplus, the university continues
to make cut after cut. When are we going to tell them enough is enough?

n o t i c e ,
College has
told us they’re shutting
the pub menu food service
in h-bar. This is the latest
in a long line of cuts:
they’ve hiked up the fee
at Ethos, they came after
the SCR breakfast and the
pool at St. Mary’s, and
they’ve raised the price of
food on campus and rent
in halls every year. While
this might not be their
most egregious decision,
for me it’s the straw that’s
broken the camel’s back.
Their justification for
this change is that the
food service was costing
College around £20k a
month to maintain. It is
unclear as to whether
this figure includes the
rent College “charges
itself” to use the kitchen
space, as they do for labs
in departments. It is also
unclear whether this is
net of College’s share of
the profits from drinks
sales, which are divided
with the Union. In other
words, they may be
overstating their costs
and understating their
profits: we’ve yet to
be presented with clear
numbers in writing.
However, even if we
were to take their £20k
figure at face value,
an effective subsidy
of under a quarter of a
million pounds per year
is small change on the
scale of the institution.
Last year, we ran an
£80m surplus, and hold
in reserve £1.6bn.
Nobody’s arguing that
we have an unlimited
amount of money to
spend: we need to be
financially solvent. But
we are a university, not
a corporation. We have a
duty to be motivated by
considerations beyond
the bottom line.
h-bar is one of the
few outlets on campus
dedicated to postgrads;
where staff and students
are often seen dining
together. For a univer-
sity that struggles to
engender a sense of
community, particularly
between its staff and
students, withdrawing
this service in a manner
which could soon lead
to the bar being closed
entirely - consider
what’ll happen to drinks
sales once the food is
gone - is irresponsible.
Supporting such a
service, the beneficiaries
of which are otherwise
under-served, at the cost
of some tiny fraction of
our surplus (if indeed
this is the case), is by no
means disproportionate.
The other troubling
aspect of College’s
decision is in how it was
communicated. Despite
their claim that conver-
sations with the Union
have been ongoing
for eight months, the
sabbatical officers
didn’t know anything
until after College had
already decided to cut
the service a week or two
ago, and the bar staff had
no idea until even more
recently. Given that the
bar has historically been
run jointly (food by the
College, drinks by the
Union) with any profits
shared, this unilateral
move is outrageous and
demonstrative of the
lack of respect the de-
cision-makers here hold
for the Union and, by
extension, the student
body.
I believe that this
decision should be
halted until a more
thorough dialogue has
taken place between
our heads - without
proper forethought and
to the exclusion of the
people that are affected
by them - I would urge
you to contact the
Provost, Ian Walmsley,
at provost@imperial.
ac.uk, and ask him to
halt this. It would be
extremely helpful if
you encouraged your
staff members to do the
same: senior manage-
ment are more likely to
listen to them than us.
Beyond that, please sign
the online petition at
tiny.cc/hbar and let the
university know they
cannot keep making
these decisions with
impunity.

all relevant parties.
This includes (but is
not limited to) College
management, the Union,
graduate students and
staff. The service need
not remain unchanged,
but we should not allow
decisions like this to be
made unilaterally and
sprung on us at the last
minute, not as students
and especially not as
partners. That’s no way
to run a large organisa-
tion.
This may not affect
all of us directly, but
we have to draw the
line somewhere. If you,
like me, are sick of the
university making these
kinds of decisions over
