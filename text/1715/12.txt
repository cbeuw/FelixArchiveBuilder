A trip down memory lane: two mini reviews
Over the Christmas break, Books writer Pavan Inguva revisited some old book purchases - and realised the
timelessness of themes and inclinations.
B
efore starting
at Imperial, I
took a short
holiday to
India to visit friends and
family. For those of you
who don’t know, India
is an amazing place to
buy books. You can get
original prints of many
books for a fraction of
the price compared to
any western country.
Obviously I took this
chance to stock up. I
did not however have
the time to read many
of them. Fast forward
to Christmas break this
academic year, when
the parents summoned
me to go home, I took
the chance to browse
through my bookshelf.
This invoked a remark-
able sense of nostalgia.
It has been more than
three years since I had
a proper look at my
own little collection. I
was both surprised and
saddened to see how
much more I read before
starting university. That
said, this was a fantastic
opportunity to review
how my own thoughts
and literary tastes have
evolved over the past
couple of years. I de-
cided to bring back two
relatively short books,
both titles I purchased
in 2015 or earlier and
have yet to read. Quite
frankly, considering
how busy final year can
be, I thought it would
be a miracle if I could
finish them during term
time, yet here we are!
This review therefore is
to me a mix of sharing
how I felt about these
two books and an oddly
therapeutic exercise
in retrospection. Both
titles are fairly straight-
forward reads that
would take a leisurely
afternoon.
No One Writes to
the Colonel by
Gabriel Garcia
Marquez
introduced to the char-
acters, there is almost
nothing of value they
own except for a prized
fighting cock. The cock
is the last thing they own
that belonged to their
son who was executed
for distributing subver-
sive literature. We are
led down the mildly
depressing path where
the Colonel gradually
realises the futility of his
hope in both his pension
coming and of the cock
yielding the desired
returns. This work
departs from Marquez’s
style of magic realism,
but it still is remarkably
effective in shedding
light on the human
psyche and response to
circumstances beyond
our control. I say this
because, whilst reading
this book, images of
a dusty Indian village
from a soap opera pop
into mind; people osten-
sibly behave in a similar
manner when faced with
comparably adverse
circumstances.

aged (read: pressured/
led) to pursue further
academic studies.
Having performed
exceedingly well in the
state exam, he entered
a prestigious academy.
At each step, for having
performed well, he was
rewarded with more
work. At the academy,
Hans befriends a rebel-
lious romantic and poet
and gradually is exposed
to worlds outside schol-
arship. Simultaneously,
his academic perfor-
mance declines and in
a cascading series of
setbacks, he drops out
of the academy. Even-
tually, Hans becomes
an apprentice mechanic
and is gradually healed
by nature and romance
only to meet his un-
fortunate end after a
jolly with his fellow
apprentices. Whilst this
plot may seem rather
trite when read today,
two points help mitigate
this. Firstly, Beneath the
Marquez, who won
the 1982 Nobel prize
for Literature, is more
well-known for his
other works such as
One Hundred Years of
Solitude and Love in the
Time of Cholera. This
story is set in the 1940s,
where a nameless retired
and impoverished
Colonel is struggling
to make ends meet. He
dutifully awaits his
military pension which
was supposed to have
arrived many a moon
ago. The title of this
book comes from the
line said by the post-
master to the Colonel as
he distributes the mail to
the villagers: “No one
writes to the Colonel!”.
His asthmatic wife
knows all the better
that it is not coming
and, by the time we are
Wheel was written over
a hundred years ago
and the content remains
relevant. Secondly,
Hesse’s sublime writing
style still makes it an
enjoyable and thought
provoking read.
Before going to uni-
versity, Hermann Hesse
was one of my favourite
authors. I enjoyed how
many of Hesse’s stories
describe the inner
turbulence of what it
means to seek for the
good life and what that
constitutes. I hesitate
to say that his work is
well-suited for working
through teenage existen-
tial angst because it is so
much more than that, but
you get my drift. I would
highly recommend
reading Steppenwolf and
The Glass Bead Game as
these are, in my opinion,
two of his most profound
works. Incidentally, he
did win the Nobel prize
for Literature in 1946.
Beneath the Wheel is
one of Hesse’s earlier
works and, having read
many of his books in
a random order, it was
interesting to see themes
present in later works
taking shape here. Hans,
a boy living in a small
village near the Black
Forest was identified as
a capable student and
correspondingly encour-
“I hesitate
to say that
his work is
well-suited
for working
through
teenage
existential
angst because
it is so much
more than
that”
