Is Universal Basic Income the real solution
to poverty?
A two-year experiment in one form of Universal Basic Income (UBI) has just come to a close
and its results have set both the UBI fans and critics twittering. Calum Drysdale explores both
the results of the Finland experiment and what this might mean for UBI in the future.

efore I begin I
should clarify
some terms.
The Finland
experiment cannot truly
be called an experiment in
Universal Base Income.
UBI is the idea that the
government should give
each of its citizens a
‘basic’ form of income. It
has been picked up by both
the left and the right with
both the Green party and
The Adam Smith Institute
(an influential centre right
think tank) advocating on
its behalf. While ideology
varies, UBI has attracted
a certain utopian miasma,
being heralded as the solu-
tion to everything from
homelessness to automa-
tion caused job loss to an
overly complicated wel-
fare system. The two-year
experiment in Finland that
has just concluded was
not a form of UBI. Rather
than giving money to a
truly random selection of
people across the demo-
graphic, socio-economic
and cultural range of the
country, unemployed
citizens between 25 and
58 were provided with
€560 (£475) per month on
top of any other forms of
welfare. However, while
limited, it provides a very
good case study for the
policy.
Unfortunately for the
utopianists, the results
were not unequivocally
positive. While the sample
group has reported higher
levels of both physical
and mental wellbeing,
unemployment figures did
not vary from the control
group.
Whilethelimitednature
of the study limits what
conclusions we can draw,
it does cause us to think
about what we want from
a social welfare program.
The Finland experiment
was not renewed due to a
perceived lack of success.
The desired reduction in
unemployment, claimed
to be one of the major
benefits of UBI, failed
to materialise. However,
how can we measure the
success of a program
that caused its recipients
to have “less stress
symptoms as well as less
difficulties to concentrate
and less health problems
than the control group”.
Advocates argue that this
increase in quality of life
is priceless.
Other studies conduct-
ed elsewhere have had
more positive results.
GiveDirectly, a charity
that provides direct cash
payments to extremely
poor people in countries
such as Kenya and
Uganda, claims that
cash transfers have had
a positive impact in both
the long and short term,
leading to big reductions
in HIV/AIDS infection
rates and low birth weight
while not causing an
increase in the purchase
of temptation goods such
as alcohol or tobacco.
A key difference
between these programs
is their scale. GiveDi-
rectly gave Kenyans $25
a month on top of any
other income, which, in a
country where the poverty
line is $57 a month, rep-
resents a fairly major sum.
In contrast, the Finnish
study gave €560 per
month. In a country where
the average wage is €3470
per month. Obviously,
these numbers are not
directly comparable but I
hope they demonstrate my
point that the money paid
to the Kenyans, many of
whom had income sources
other than welfare, is of
a different scale to the
money paid to the unem-
ployed Finnish.
I think what can be
taken from this is that,
while giving money to
anyone is going to make
them happier, it is not
going to act as a panacea.
People are usually unem-
ployed due to underlying
issues such as a lack of
education or chronic
health problems. These
a way of sweetening the
medicine of welfare in the
eyes of the middle classes
by making it seem fair
and balanced as everyone
receives the same amount.
The money would be a
boost to those who know
how to handle money and
not those, like the unem-
ployed or homeless, that
have a proven bad track
record.
However, just like
the poll tax that charges
everyone the same flat
amount, UBI is extremely
regressive. As an exten-
sion of this, the argument
made by right-wing advo-
cates of UBI, that it would
reduce the bureaucracy
of welfare, is a narrow
minded one. By limiting
welfare exclusively to
UBI the state would
be failing in its duty to
provide for its poorest
members.
Secondly, if UBI is
intended as a replacement
of the safety net and as an
answer to the problems
brought on by automation,
it will raise important
questions about the re-
sponsibilities of the state
to its people. Should the
government keep funding
social services, the NHS
and jobseekers if every
citizen has, in theory, the
means to live?
UBI is, to me, a blunt
instrument to a complicat-
ed problem. The British
Universal Credit system,
that aims to simplify the
benefit system, is far more
efficient, even if it has
been hamstrung by Tory
ideologues.
Free money for everyone?/ / DiEM 25
people often need more
than just cash. They need
active help from the state
rather than hands off and
impersonal cash. Here we
arrive at my own personal
bugbear about UBI.
I believe that any
program that funnels
money towards the poor
and unemployed would
have a similarly positive
effect. For me, UBI has
two major flaws. Firstly,
rather like free university
tuition, UBI is a poisoned
chalice that is regressive
rather than progressive.
Whilst you can argue
that giving money to the
middle classes is going to
improve their lot, it is ex-
tremely inefficient. Why
give money to people
that do not need it when
it could be better spent?
In this capacity, UBI is
