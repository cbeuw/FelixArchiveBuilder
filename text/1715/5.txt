Brexit to end the NHS: Hypochondria or the
real deal?

orn in 1948, the
NHS has sur-
vived through
a lot. However,
like many other 70 year
olds, the NHS is facing
multiple chronic issues
that cannot be fixed with a
simple operation. Patients
are waiting longer and
longer to see a doctor,
both in GP practices and
A&Es. This is due to a
multitude of reasons,
ranging from inadequate
recruitment and chronic
underfunding, to an aging
population with more
complex healthcare needs.
It is largely agreed that the
current NHS model is not
sustainable.
Intrinsic efforts to
improve the health of the
NHS, termed ‘efficiency
savings’, have helped a
bit, but have not reached
the ambitious targets
set by the government.
Instead, the government
has resorted to bullying
junior doctors and
nurses, squeezing out
every ounce of their
collective good will.
Overworked, underpaid,
and morale at its nadir;
the system is creaking
at the seams. Surely any
acute changes to the
delicate balance cur-
rently keeping the NHS
together would lead to
its demise. Enter stage
right: Brexit.
During the referen-
dum campaign in 2016,
Brexit was touted as the
saviour for the NHS.
Brexiteers recommend-
ed taking the money
we would normally
give the EU and rein-
vesting it to improve
our health services.
Furthermore, they
proposed that regaining
control of the borders
would prevent ‘health
tourists’ and ‘economic
migrants’ from entering
our country, and would
therefore reduce the
strain on our public
services. Both of these
claims were the basis
of the ‘Save our NHS’
campaign run by Vote
Leave.
As attractive as the
Vote Leave claims are,
they wilfully ignore the
benefits of staying in the
EU. This is becoming
increasingly clear as
authorities are preparing
for a ‘no-deal’ Brexit,
since negotiations
between the EU and UK
government continue to
break down. A ‘no-deal’
Brexit could lead to a
10% decrease in UK
GDP in 15 years. Even
if a deal is made, it is
still not forecasted to
benefit GDP in the long
run. Since the health
of the NHS mirrors the
strength of the economy,
the NHS will struggle for
the foreseeable future
due to Brexit. However,
Brexiteers argue that
this is not accurate as
economic forecasts
are frequently wrong,
citing the example that
the economy is cur-
rently growing despite
forecasts predicting a
post-referendum reces-
sion. Nonetheless, the
one thing that can be
agreed is that ‘no-deal’
would be the worst
outcome economically.
Forecasted economic
growth also depends on
changes in EU migration
policy. Currently around
130,000 doctors, nurses
and care-workers are re-
cruited from the EU. In
2018, there was a 17.6%
decrease in EU workers
joining the NHS and
15.3% increase of EU
workers leaving the
NHS. The National
Institute of Economic
and Social Research
predicts there will be
10,000 extra nursing
vacancies due to a lack
of EU workers by 2021.
Additionally, by 2025
they predict that there
will be a gap of up to
70,000 workers in social
care. This is clearly not
ideal considering the
importance of nurses
and social workers in
managing our ageing
and growing population.
However this has been
deemed “fear-monger-
tical Industry. Conse-
quently, the Department
of Health has revealed
that they have started to
stockpile 6 weeks’ worth
of prescription medica-
tions as a contingency
plan. For medical items
with shorter shelf-lives
(such as radioactive
isotopes used in nuclear
medicine), plans have
been made for these
to be transported in
by air at short notice.
All of these measures
are fairly expensive to
the taxpayer and could
cost up to £2 billion
according to the Remain
campaign group, Best
for Britain. Stockpiling
drugs seems to paint an
image of an apocalyp-
tic-like scenario and is
an illustration of how
dangerous Brexit really
is. During the campaign,
situations like these
were labelled as ‘Project
Fear’ but, 33 months
later, it is really happen-
ing- it’s the ‘real deal’.
It seems Brexit was
sold to the public based
on misinformation and
lies. Therefore one could
argue that the “informed
consent” declared by the
public in the advisory
referendum is not valid,
as the benefits and risks
were not appropriately
explained. As a conse-
quence of this wilful de-
ception, the health of the
NHS has deteriorated.
In medico-legal terms,
this would be classi-
fied criminal battery
and can result in a jail
sentence. In political
terms, this is classified
as ‘campaigning’, so no
one is held accountable
for running a ‘Save our
NHS’ movement which
may eventually ‘End our
NHS’.

ing” by Brexiteers, who
claim the predictions
are based on flawed
assumptions and claim
Britain will still be
open for business after
Brexit. Indeed, doctors
and nurses are now
excluded from the cap
on tier 2 visas for skilled
workers. Unfortunately,
this exception does not
include social workers,
and, hence, alternative
ways for recruiting
social workers will need
to be sought, especially
if no deal is struck with
the EU.
Leaving the customs
union with no deal could
have ‘catastrophic’
effects on our access to
medications as around
half of our medicines go
through the EU before
reaching the UK accord-
