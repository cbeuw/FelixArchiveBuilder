A f t e r an enjoyable week i n the H uad
I.C. Jazz Band finished W.U.S. Week by
gaining second plaoe i n the Jazz compet-
i t i o n . In the preliminary round at
U.L.U. the band played magnificently to
gain a well-deserved ,plaoe i n the f i n a l
at Bedford. But here, where hopes were
at f i r s t understandably high, tragedy
struck. The bare! was h i t by an un-
expected attack of nerves, which was
attributed to the rather i n e f f i c i e n t
organisation , poor playing conditions,
arÂ»i lack of suitable l i q u i d refreshment.
The f i n a l result i s , however, very com-
mendable and a l l monetary congratulations
should be sent to the President v i a the
Union rack.
The personnel were:
J e f f Kay
Mike Newson
Gordon B a r t l e t t
Chris Adams
Dick Slingsby
John Farosworth
- trumpet
- clarinet
- trombone
- piano
- guitar
- bass
and Gordon Frlchard at the drums.
Speoial mention should be made of
John Parnsworth whose e*oellent bass
playing was oommended by the judges.
As with most previously experienced
jazz competitions the organisation was
rather poor. Next year i t i s hoped
that I.C. Jazz Club w i l l run a competi-
tion themselves and win i t .
DEATH SENTENCE
At the B.G.M. of the R.3.M.U. on
Thursday 1Vth May the death sentence on
Clem was announced. Just before Easter
the Insurance Brokers examining engineer
inspected her i n general and the b o i l e r
i n particular. When the report was
sent i t wa3 accompanied by a request f o r
the return of the b o i l e r insurance cert-
i f i c a t e , the b o i l e r "being very o l d , and
past i t ' s useful l i f e " . This was duly
returned, and of course without this
Clem could not be taken on the road again.
The cost of replacing the b o i l e r
would be f a r greater than buying a new
engine, the b o i l e r constituting the maj-
or part of the structure, and suoh a
replacement having to be custom-built.
At, tne union Meeting a deoision on
a new mascot was deferred u n t i l the next
meeting, to allow the Minesmen to think
over the problems involved. The main
question i s whether to have another
steam-propelled vehicle or one powered
by an internal combustion engine.
Both have t h e i r pros and cons, and the
decision of the next meeting i s looked
forward to with interest.
I.M. Plummer.

"There are women at I.C." This
remark greeted the team of women from
Imperial College when they entered the
Fashion Competition at Regent's Park.
It i s the f i r s t time, that I.C. has
been represented i n any such form of
competition. The theme was "Morning,
Noon and Night" with no rules about what
was to be worn. Westfield team turned
continental and modelled a swimsuit, a
shortie nightie f o r siesta time and a
short evening dress. They were announ-
ced the winners by the judge, Marjorie
Proops of the "Daily Mirror" with
Northampton Engineering College seoond
and Q.E.C. t h i r d .
The I C. team were well received.
Miss Proops commented i n her resume' on
the black velvet pants worn by the f i r s t
model Rosalie who also wore a tangerine
long sleeved blouse with a wide boat-
necked c o l l a r . These two garments
were lent by Estrava Separates of Gros-
venor Street, and were worn with a
reversible corduroy three-quarter-length
jacket and tangerine casual shoes.
Modelling a luncheon date o u t f i t ,
lent by Rembrant Dresses, Helgi appeared
i n a navy blue two-piece with a short
jacket decorated with a white polka-
dotted red bow. A white cloohe hat
with whioh accessories and a red um-
b r e l l a completed the o u t f i t . In a
short evening dress lent by Rembrandt
Dresses, Sheenagh completed the team's
performance. The dress, with a knife
pleated s k i r t , was i n white nylon with
a blue and green flower pattern, the
green being brought out by the matching
emerald green shoes and clutch bag.
A l l the shoes were lent by Saxone.
The three models were introduced by
Peter Morgan who impressively described
the o u t f i t s .
NELSON NOTES
This year's best quote must surely
be that statement by Gen. Edelman about
the garrison of American Soldiers undo*
his oommand. He t a c t f u l l y referred to
then as a "small, but potent, force".
I t seems that a l l ICWAriana now
display large photographs of Tony
"Dreamboat* Ewart on t h e i r w a l l . This
has l e d to the recurrent f i t s of soreamd
to be heard i n the wee small hours. The
pioture, viewed i n the half l i g h t , i s
even worse than the o r i g i n a l . Besides,
Tony never t e l l s then when he's coming.
Has anyone heard tne man with the
golden horn - David "Hotlips" Irving of
l a t e T He could not r e s i s t mentioning
h i s hobby i n Carnival - see h i s remarks
about "expensive bugling" at I.C.
A reoent party, held i n several
rooms of the Garden Hostel, provoked
one inmate, lady-friend i n attendance,
to sake the p l a i n t i v e request " Would
you please d e a r the room now, some of
us want to go to bed*.
