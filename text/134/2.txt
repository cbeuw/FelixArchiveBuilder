THE OFFICIAL OPENING CSREHCNY
On the 8th May the Haldane Library
waa o f f i c i a l l y open,* i n i t s new premises
at 13 Princes Gardens. The opening
ceremony was performed by Mr. T G N
Haldane, a nephew of Lord Haldane! the
founder.
The Reotor, as part of h i s i n t r o -
ductory remarks said:-
"On the whole, whether they l i k e i t
or not, the yound s c i e n t i s t s o f today
are l i a b l e to have increasingly diverse
parts to play i n l i f e . They w i l l be-
come mixed up with problems of communi-
cation and of management; ( p a r t i c u l a r l y
as they get older); with human problems
and with value Judgements. So, f o r
rather p r a c t i c a l reasons, i t i s import-
ant that t h e i r o v e r a l l education should
be as broad as possible.
It has always seemed to me that the
provision of a good non-soientiflo
library i s an essential activity of a
scientific institution whioh alas to
educate rather than merely train. Such
a library was included in our plans for
expanision but unfortunately i t came at
a rather late stage in the new buildings.
But when we acquired Prince's Gardens we
had the chance of getting a flying start
and these roosts and this gathering today
is the result."

AND THE RECTOR.
finally, the Rector olosed his int-
roduction by introducing Mr. Haldane with
these words:-
"It i s a great pleasure that the
opening i s to be done by Mr. T.G.N.
Haldane his nephew. He has been a
moat valued member of the Governing
Body for ten years. In the next room
you w i l l find evidence of his keen i n -
terest and generosity, the portrait of
his uncle, a set of Lord Haldane's
works and his biography by General
Maurice. Tor these gifts and for what
ha w i l l do today we thank him very
much."
In reply, Mr. Haldane began by
mentioning hia uncle and gave some
personal recollections of him, which
served to illustrate hia great depth of
intellect.

"I have so frequently heard scien-
t i s t s and engineers complaining that the
higher posts, whether i t be in industry,
teaching or any other f i e l d , are so
often reserved f o r those who are not
primarily soienti3ts or technologists.
I have even heard i t suggested that there
i a a sort of conspiracy to keep scien-
tists and engineers out of the top
positions and give them to those who have
reoieved a classical education. Although
this country has been slow to realize
the value of science and technology, I
feel myself the explanation of the past
failure of scientists and engineers to
f i l l the higher positions has been due
mainly to a certain narrowness of out-
look or to excessive specialisation at
too early a stage. Hence the old un-
fortunate tendency to regard scientists
and engineers simply as "specialists".
A l l the top positions necessitate a
great deal of administrative work and
must be f i l l e d by those who can take a
braod point of view. They must have
knowledge and experience in the handl-
ing of men, as well as materials.
I believe this narrowness of out-
look i s rapidly passing, and confident-
ly expect to see very many of the high-
est positions f i l l e d by those who have
been trained as soiantists and techno-
logists, but whose knowledge and experi-
ence is not confined to soientifio
matters only. If your Reotor w i l l
kindly not listen for a moment I would.
like to suggest he i s a very good exam-
ple of what I have in mind.
I hope this Library, which I under-
stand to be well stooiced with non-
soientifio and non-teohnioal works, will
be of real value in enabling you to aamk
that breadth of viewpoint whioh was a
characteristic of the man whose name i s
being commemorated and I have very much
pleasure in declaring the Library open.

AN APPEAL
The college was shocked to leam
of the death of a well-known figure -
Mohammed Said Taha - studying here for
a Ph.D. in Geology. He died in the
Hammersmith Hospital on May 14th, being
so unfortunate as to be fatally allergic
to penicillin.
Only two students won scholarships
in Syria to carry out studies in Geology
in this oountry. The other was Mr.
J.N. Khouri, who has written this
"Mohammed Said Taha, was the son of
a farmer, was bon i n 1923 i n the small
market town of Dvx aa i n Syria. His
secondary education was completed i n
Damascus from where he won a scholar-
ship - In 1951 - to come t:> this country.
His early l i f e , working a-. r j 3 t the
people and amongst the in-ell«ctuals
had assured him an essen'ially homani-
tarian oharaoter who realised that
responsibility for helping these more
unfortunate rested upon the individual
himself.
Aoademioally, he was brilliant,
coming top in the final exam. In 1957
he was registered for a Ph.D. The first
ohapter waa oomjlete before his death.
His reoent work has beer, desoribed as
"the major geological disoovery of the
last two deoades".
Extra-murally, he was an active
founder memoer of the Arab Student
Union and the President of the UUJ Arab
Society as well as President of the
Union itself i n 1958. Many social
functions i n this College were also due
to his efforts.
There remains a yet more tragic
aspect of this story - his first ohild
is s t i l l only three months old. The
I.C. Arab Society has taken upon itself
the responsibility of the upbringing,
and his olosest friend will supervise
the ohilds eduoation.
A fund has been started to ensure
this care of the ohild. Naturally, any
donations to thia fund w i l l be welcomed
wholeheartedly. Cheques may be made
payable to J.N. Khouri and/or A.A. E l
Behadi.
If you are so kind as to wish to
contribute, please send your donation
