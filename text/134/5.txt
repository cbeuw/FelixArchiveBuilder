PEACE SOCIETY
Dear Sir,
I was disgusted to hear that the
Social Clubs Committee decided at this
meeting on Thursday 7th May that there
was no need for a Peace Society at I.C.
and that other societies already f u l -
filled its intended aims.
Firstly, i f there are suoh societies
already, I should like to hoar of them-,
for I have not as yet heard of a Soo-
iety at I.C. whioh supports the aims of
the campaign for Nuclear Disarmament
openly or givea wnt to the Pacifist
cause. Perhaps these societies men-
tioned hold their meetings in secret?
Seoondly, by what authority does
the Social Clubs Committee imply that
we have no need of a Peace Society
when certain students have made i t
dear that they are determined that
it should be formed and are not satis-
fied that existing Societies completely
represent their feelings? -Surely i f
students express a need for a Sooiety,
then the need ia there, and whether
there are 22 or 220 signatures i s
quite irrelevant.
It has been objected that a Peace
Sooiety would automatically aspire to
the left. Does this mean to suggest
that only people of the left have any
concern about peace - I really would
like to- know.
Alfred Linney.
Dear Sir,
At the S.C.C. meeting last Thurs-
day a motion, proposed by Dave Finney,
to form a Peace Committee in I.C. (i.e.
a branoh of the C.N.D.) was adopted.
However, when taken to Union Council by
the S.C.C. Seoretary the motion was
rejected. The reason given was that
the functions of such a Committee could
be adequately carried out by the Inter-
national Relations Club, which Mr.
Finney is oo-opted ante It i s a well-
known faot that the I.R.C. i s simply a
social olub, and does not provide an
adequate rostrum for a peace campaign.
In view of this, i t would appear
that this is a deliberate attempt by
the Union officials conoerned to sab-
otage the formation of a peaoe camp-
aign in.this oollege. At present I.C.
i s probably the only oollege in London
which does not have suoh a campaign, a
faot which does not enhance our popul-
arity with the rest of London University.
I consider i t a scandal that noth-
ing has been done about this question
before, and call upon those Union o f f i -
cials tc present their case before the
•hole student body at the next Union
meeting, where I trust that others
beside myself will take uo the matter.
Tours sincerely,
Fred Roberta,

IRVING
Dear Sir,
In the controversies that ha>d
raged over David Irving, suoh phrases
as "assessment of vhe facts" and "un-
biased facts" have often appeared in
emotional rather than factual contacts.
People tend to be either 100$ anti-
Irving or 100J? pro-Irving (not that
there are many of the latter now), and
neither of these extremes is to my mind
wholly correct.
It i s easy to forget that Irving
is one of the most competent Journal-
ists in"the University, and was on
that basis alone a natural ohoioe for
the editorship of Carnival. A l l w i l l
agree, I am sure, that he aade an ex-
cellent Job of the major part of the
magazine. The balance could have
been better, i t i s true, but the stan-
dard of presentation was high and the
demands of a tight production schedule
were jure than adequately met (even
after the reprinting, Carnival was
published on time). *t i s ironic
that this fine effort was spoiled as
i t was.
Let us t r y and be reasonable
about a l l t h i s . Irving has a point
of view, and i t should be heard, but
not in a charity magazine. A just
and sober condemnation o f his action
is one thing; an exaggerated and
h y s t e r i c a l hate campaign i s another.
We oan surely agree to qs,ffer with
his p o l i t i c a l opinions, .sven though
we f e e l onlv contempt f $ r the way he
chose to express them.
Lastly, i t seems less than f a i r
to blame a certain member of I.C.
Union Council for what happened. I
understand that this gentleman did
warn the U.L.U.-W.U.S. Committee that
something like this was liable to
happen, but the safeguards agreed upon
were, at the time, considered adequate.
lours sincerely,
Anthony L. Brookes.

" C a r n i v a l "
Dear S i r ,
In your last issue you attacked
what you considered to be the decep-
tion committed by the ex-editor of
Carnival Times: you also said that the
ideologies whioh promoted "suoh abuse"
should not go unoondemned.
Is i t as simple as a l l that? I
don't think so. As one reads through
the Press, be i t the National Dailies,
the Weeklies, - even the University
publicity and propaganda for the Egal-
itarian ideologies. There ia l i t t l e ,
i f any, space given to the other point
of view. A balanoe has ceased to exist
There are some who get a l i t t l e
tired of a l l this, and who hope to see
some of these specious arguments answer-
ed. I thing that there is some measure
of deliberate policy adhered to by the
whole Press, whioh forbids the printing
of muoh reasoned right-wing thinking,
perhaps for fear of offending oertain
groups of would-be readers. It i s for-
gotten that Egalitarianiam offends the
intellects of others.
In such circumstances, i t i s per-
haps understnadable that those, whose
reasoned views are consistently rejected
by a l l the ordinary means of publloity
in favour of the very theories whioh
they so despise, turn and look for aone
extraordinary means of attracting pub-
licity. Inevitably either violence or
deception will play a part.
The argument is often used that the
views of the majority should reoeive the
most publicity, and that the Right i s so
• • a l l that i t should have none. *et i s
it really sensible to propagandise peo-
ple with views they already hold? To
do so makes them dogmatic, narrow-
minded, complacent, prejudiced, and un-
sound. In my view i t i s right to offer
roughly equal space to a l l shades of
opinion, and the most important thing i s
to maintain a balanoe. If this were
done, the Right would have its share of
the publicity, and i t would not be for-
ced into unorthodox attempts to get heard.
Tours faithfully,
M.J.G. Moir
ISSUE - LAST, AMD SPECIAL
COMMENT
I would like to make i t d e a r that
neither Felix nor the editor has any wish
to prevent David Irving explaining his
[point of view or his modus Vivendi. In
deed, I would be ody too glad i f he
would do so. Three times he has been
offered the opportunity to do so in the
columns of this paper. That he has
never taken the opportudty i s his own
fault and he cannot Justifiably oompl
ain that his views are being suppressed.
