On May 5-th, 7th and 9th the
University of London Athletics Champ-
ionships were held at Motspur Park.
In the past two years I.C.A.C. have
been narrowly defeated, so that.this
year a special effort was made.
The 5th and 7t>" comprised the heats
of most events and several finals. The
final of the 220 yards low hurdles
gained the club 2nd and 5th places.
W. Melbourne was 2nd with T. Hyslop
5th. The 3OOO metres steeplechase saw
a fine run by J. Cleator, who was
narrowly defeated by Bryan of St. Mary's
Hospital. Both men were credited with
the same time of 9 » 27.6 whioh con-
stitutes a new championship best per- .
formance. The two mile walk saw two
Yorkshiresen fight i t out for 5th and
6th places. (No comment)
The only events i n which I.C.A.C.
had no representatives in the finals,
held on the 9th, were the Hammer and
Triple Jump.
Probably the best individual
performances were set up by
C.C. Connolly, A.McDonald and J.
Cleator, a l l l s t year students. Conn-
olly placed 2nd in both the Shot and
Javelin (174' 5") and 3rd i n the discus.
His shot and javelin performances form
new college records.
Archie McDonald provided our only
victory of the champs when he walked
home (not really) in the 220 yards, i n
a very good time of 22.4 sees; He mas
also placed second in the 100 yards.
A fine effort,Archie.
J. Cleator, as already mentioned
gained 2nd place in the steeplechase.
In the mile Pete Sperrin of St. Mary's
Hospital proved too strong for John,
who recorded a very fast 4 rain. 21.1
sees., when taking 2nd plane.
C.C. CONNOLLY IN ACTION
It i s impossible to mention a l l
I.C.A.C'3 individual performances but
I feel I must congratulate Pete
Rayment, our captain., far a very good
half adle. His time of 1 m. 58.9 sees,
only gained him sixth place, but at las*
he has broken the 2 minute barrier.
Dave Briggs ran a good 3 miles when
taking 2nd place to Tory Napier.
The final result was#I.C.A.C.
94 pts., St. M ry's Hospital 77 pts.
and the remainder of the Colleges
somewhere below 4'. pts. This victory
was the result of an a l l round team
effort: each competitor deserves
special congratulations.
CRICKET CLUB'S
PROMISING START
The cricket olub, despite the loss
of several "veterans" has made a most
promising start to the season. Though the
lst H has never quite been at full str-
ength, It has never looked like losing a
match.
The first match at Wye was raised
by the weather though there was ample
compensation! Batting first against
L.S.E. (a side who have often taken adv-
antage of our early season for*) we
slumped from 66 for 3 to 74 for 6 but
a fine unbroken partnership between L.
Williams (42) and T. King (40) enabled
us to declare at 158 for 6. L.3.B.'s
attempt to get the runs was foiled
by a fine spell of bowling by Logan who
took 8 for 18 and they scraped a draw,
being 40 for 9 at the olose.
Against Baatoote, thanks to a tidy
58 by White, 43 by Bartholomew and 37
no by Burden we declared at 15? for 7-
Eastoote started briskly and there were
visions of a great finish but our leg-
spinner Galbally ( 4 for 22) induced them
to hit out recklessly and once more we
had to bo content with a draw with I.C.
very much on top, Eastoota being 88 for
5 st one stage before they gave up the
*haeo.
The match against St. Mark and St.
John gave the l a t II their fi-st win (by
58 runs). Some attractive strokes
from L. Williams (32) for at was f o l -
lowed by another fine spell of bowling
by Logan who finished the match with s
hat-trick ( a l l bowled!) and figures of
8 for 23.
Logan was to prove his worth with
the bat i n the next aatoh v. Old Sinjuns
when he soorod a brisk 31 whioh con-
solidated a steady start, opening bat-
jman White scoring 43. Setting them
188 to win st s rata of 85 runs per hour
the Old Sinjun* collapsed and were 59
far 6 before they decided to play out
time and on a good Harlington wioket,
few things are easier!
St. Bernards Hospital were trounced
by 7 wickets. Batting first they were
bowled out for 54 (Logan taking 6 for 25)
and we hit off the runs before tea for
the loss of 3 wioketa.
Middlesex Hospital took 2| hours to
score 127, Martin Baking 5 for 22 for
I.S. but our bid to score the runs i n
100 minutes did not come off, primarily
because of • poor start and the match was
drawn.
The 2nd XI are also unbeaten so
far. Most notable was their win against
Kings last week. The Third H have p l -
ayed occasionally and won 2, lost 1 and
of course the Sunday XI has been up to
its usual antics (Captained by Oggi!!)
There are several encouraging
features of the teams' play. The
batting ia solid right down the order,
the bowling i s tight and varied and bow-
lers are trying to bowl to their field,
only the fielding needs tightening up
and this will undoubtedly come with more
practice. Seven new players have a l -
ready made the l s t XI and a l l have per-
formed well. Significant i s the fact
that both Eastoote and Old Sinjuns beat
us last year while this year they were
fighting to avoid defeat a l l the time.
There is much material end (soccer teams
please mote) we have a bearded fields-
man who persists in kicking the ball
(usually over the boundary) with remark-
able accuracy.
Looking ahead to the Devon tour,
we should be able to take a strong tour-
ing side even with several members from
the 2nd or 3rd XI's whose keenness and
ability ia beyond doubt.
