With a team of only 13 competitors
I.C.A.C. came close to beating the strong
B r i s t o l University team (Southern U.A.TJ.
Champions) in an exciting away match on
Saturday l a s t . Each event was closely
contested and many excellent performances
were seen on a rather uneven grass track.
Net -ble among these was a 1 min.
59.0 sec. by our captain, 21 year o l d
(Mr?) Peter Rayment, i n the 880 yards.
Bernard Curtis recorded a double v i c t o r y
when clocking 10.1 and 23.2 i n the 100
and 220 yards respectively.
The f i n a l 3core i n the match was a
81 pts to 75 win for B r i s t o l . The day
was sounded o f f i n typical fashion by
most of the team missing the l a s t t r a i n
back to London. (Where are they now?)

Last Saturday John Collins took part

P i r i e 3rd. John ran a very good race
to f i n i s h 13th i n a time of 53 minutes.
L A W N T E N N I S
In the l a s t two weeks the club has
had considerable success and won a l l
i t s matches. The f i r s t team have done
very w e l l , having good wins over Kings,
U.C. and Wye, the l a t t e r being the most
enjoyable match of the season, so f a r .
The team i 3 beginning to settle down and
find i t s true form; fartunately, too
a l l the pairs are very even and we have
a steady, r e l i a b l e team - the f i r s t time
for many years. The Club was given a
walk-over against ^.M.C. i n the U.L.
Cup who were unlucky i n not being able
to raise a team over the Whitsun week-
end.
The 3econd team have recently
beaten Northern Polytechnic by a winning
margin of 5 matches to 2, the match being
unfinished due to bad l i g h t .

Sports day this year was blessed
with a b r i l l i a n t l y sunny day and a f a i r
sized crowd to spur the performers on to
two college records and eight best
sports performances. Outstanding per-
formances were recorded by A. MacDonald
i n winning both the 100 and 220, and
C. Connolly who won the Javelin, Discus
and shot a l l i n new meeting records.
W. Melbourne won the 120 yd hurdles and
the pole vault, and took second place
i n the high jump. The top performance
were t o R. Hedge who won the long jump
with 22 f t . 3 j i n . , a new college record
and best sports performance. The o l d
record of 21' 9" had stood since 1923.
The mile once again provided the
speotacle of the day with J . Cleator and
D. Briggs of R.C.S. burning o f f a l l
opposition i n the f i r s t lap and racing
neck and neck to f i n i s h i n the j o i n t
time of 4: 22.6 with Cleator taking
the decision by no more than 12 i n .

'UF AMD OVER*
The s t a f f race was won by Prof.
3parke i n a time which was disappoint-
ing to those with their eyes on world
performances. P. Benham ccnpetir.g
for the f i r s t time showed definite pro-
mise but finished fatigued after a slow
s t a r t , K. Weale too, could mature but
must learn to concentrate en the race i n
hand.
In the 4*4-0 yds R.C.S. scored a
double with K. Ludlair. coming thraigh very
fast to win from A. Meade who had made
the pace throughout. During the inter-
val entertainment was provided by a
netball match between I.C.'.V.A. and the
Basketball Club, i n a game i n which the
result never seemed important.
The 880 was won by P. Rayment the
I.C. captain followed by D. Briggs, both
showing good form and judgement Ln an
excellent race. An innovation to the
meeting was the introduction of a 1500
m steeplechase won by J . l l e a t o r with
A. Larkum runner up. Despite the com-
parative r a r i t y of t h i s race a l l the
runners gave a fine display i n the tech-
nique of this d i f f i c u l t sport. The
mare sadistic spectators were well sat-
i s f i e d when one competitor plunged i n t o
the water jump.
The ladies i n v i t a t i o n relay was won
by Reading. I.C. were doubly represent-
ed by both I.C.W.A. and a team from
Admin.
There was tremendous interest i n
the i n t e r oollege competition, and with
the relays to be run i t was neck and neck
between Guilds and R.C.S. F.C.S. then
won the 220.220.443 r e l a y with a b r i l -
l i a n t l a s t leg by A. Meade, but Guilds
squared the issue by winning the 4*110
with a new sports record of 45.0 sees.
The outoome then rested on the tug bet-
ween R.C.S. and Mines, and we were t r e a t -
ed to the sight of the Guildsmen cheering
the Mines team home t o t h e i r only v i c t o -
ry. Guilds were then the victors of
the sports day f o r the fourth successive
year.
