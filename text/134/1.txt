STATEMENT BY EDITOR
At least one point of interest has
arisen from the brouhaha surrounding
the a f f a i r s of the late David Irving -
quite a few people are suddenly aware
that there are other student newspapers
around - other than the venerable *
"Sennet".
I refer, of course, to those copies
of PI - the newspaper of University1
Coll-
ege - which were on sale .in the Hall of
the Union immediately,proceeding (the
Irving fracas.
These people have looked at EI and
than looked at "Felix" - which appeared
shortly afterwards - and to their eyea,
the newspaper of their Union came off
a very seoond best. . .In fact, i t seem-
ed to them that they were not being
served by their Union as they had the
right to expect.
QUESTIONS
With this in mind they hare been
asking some questions. Some very pert-
inent and pointed questions! Within
one day I was asked the following:
Why cannot'our newspaper be'
printed, as opposed to the peculiar
method that i s used now?"
"Why cannot Felix be givon at
least the general appearance of a
newspaper, i n , of course, the lay-
out and headings*'"'
"Why not make Felix weekly?"and
finally, a very popular question -
"Why not include advertisements in
Felix?" '
Pour good questions, and four that
cannot be ignored. It i s at least some
oomfort that the questioners have thought
about their own newspaper and would then
Like to have a say i n i t s appearance,
as they have every right to do - Felix
being the Official organ - i f you w i l l
excuse the Word - of the I.C. Union.
FAULTS
We must however be realistic as to
the faults of Felix. Compared/to the
glossy "art" paper that i s used i n the
printing of PI and the Cub, the surface
of Felix looks rather cheap and crude.
Oompared to the set type of the same
twwapapsrs, the typewritten photocopies
nt the Felix pages look amateurish.
The main headings. - the banners and sub-
headings are at the often a l l too ten-
der mercies of the man with the stencil.
At the last general Union meeting,
l i t t l e laugh was raised by the fact
that the total profit from Felix - don-
ated to the Union funds - was the
princely sum of £2. A small amount
and an insignificant one compared to
the vast turn-over of some other organ-
isations.
But i t was a profit of £2. The
glossy PI - the cause of this discon-
tent costs i t 3 Union between £200 and
£L00 per year, according to the differ-
ence between i t s printing bills and
the amount taken from sales. Some of
the ether newspapers in London oost
their Unions more in subsidies aixl a l l
this on a much lower readership!
Felix states proudly that i t has
a circulation of 1,500 - whioh ia Justi-
fied. True this circulation has a ten-
dency to fluctuate being dependent on
the vagaries of exams, the weather and
whether your grant is pa'd on a Friday.
But 1,500 is Justified.
With a l l respect to the Cub and
to FX and many others of their con-
temporaries , do you think that they are
giving their respective Unions several
hundred pounds worth of service. I
certainly do not think so. I do not
believe that The Imperial Collage
union would be justified i n approp-
riating some £200 of i t s funds i n order
that Felix should have type set up for
each issue.
ADVERTISE*;
As to advertising - Felix sella
well enough now (for the purposes of
this argument) without f i l l i n g apanc
with advert*, that can be seen every-
where you turn - from the glossy mag-
azines to the television and along
every highway in Britain. Student
advertisements are always welcome and
have been a regular feature of Felix
for a long time - but no "beer ia best"
please.
Could Felix appear weekly. It
could do, without a doubt, but i t will
not do so under my editorship, nor, X
think, under the editorship of anyone
who has anything else to do at this
College. He will soon find that the
customary fortnightly make-up takes
enough time as i t i s . I doubt also
whether there is enough "hot" news
at this College to f i l l more than 2
pages each week. If the Union oould
be persuaded to pay out some more money
and employ at least two permanent staff
for their newspaper, then perhaps the
weekly Felix will become a possibility!

THE FUTURE
Is there any way of changing the
faoe of Felix without losing i t s uni-
que oharacter as a student newspaper?
The following remarks are of a personal
na*->—e - and have no offioial weight
for I speak only aa an editor ( and
nearly a past editor) of this news-
paper.
I believe that the Linotype pro-
oess may offer a means of producing a
Felix whose appearance more closely
approximates to a printed newspaper -
and at very l i t t l e increased oost - i f
i t is acceptable that Felix should
"break-even" rather than try to make
a bigger profit. The present Felix
printer ia working on this idea and
maybe your first Felix of next year will
conform to this requirement.
My feeling i s that Felix has grown
up - and i t i s time that he looked like
an adult.
Whatever the final solution chosen,
I feel sure that Felix will emerge t r i -
amohant, and with his usual grin.
We regret to announce the death
of Mr. Richard Font, M.P. for Clithence,
Lancashire, who has been one of our
Governors since 1957, and also chairman
of the Parliamentary and Scientific
Ooanittee.
Mr. Fort was killed when hia
oar was i n a head-on sollislon with a
coach on the Oxford-Henley road last
Saturday, May 16th.
He leaves a widow and five children.
