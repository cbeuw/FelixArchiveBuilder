The front page article about the
future of this newspaper - is probably
mors than enough from me this week.
However, there i s a small topic that I
feel i t neoessary to mention. In the
brighter weather that wp have enjoyed
recently, i t has become the practice to
take 1
*inks - hard or soft - out into
the quad. A l l very pleasant, I agree.
Unfortunately, i t has also become a
practice to leave the empty glasses
l y i n g about. Both dangerous and
selfish. It really doesn't take much
effort to return them - and very l i t t l e
more to see that piecec of paper,
wrappers etc., are not allowed to blow
about a l l over the place.

How showing in London, the latest
in the series of the American realism
films. This is an all-taking, ,,#11-spit-
ting story about a big finance company
in Chicago and is called "Under Crossed
Hickels".
The extent to whioh the Producer
is willing to go to introduce a note of
reality into the film oan be gauged from
the opening scene, whioh i s set i n an
Abyssinian dope-den, kept by a l e f t -
handed middle-class hypocrite>
The rugged Method actor - Stark Pud-
ge - plays the part of "Fingers" Crutt,
a well-known layabout, who - crossed in
love - attempts to forget by drawning his
sorrows i n Dark Oak Varnish '38. This
attempt f a i l s , but he ends up by winning
a prise for interior decorating. Even
this fails to console hia however; the
very depths of human indignity becomes
his lot - he throws his l i f e to the winds
and goes to College. His dear old
father, white-haired and in for l i f e
oannot stand the shame and shoots 14
warders, the Governor and the Governor's
oat - against whom he had some personal
grudge (never clarified) to do with the
drinking water.
Thus ends the first reel Perhaps
someone with a stronger stomach or a
bigger bucket will inform us how the sec-
ond reel goes.

MTKE 'RO'JGH-HIDE' HONER happened
somewhere between 20 and 25 years
ago when nobody was really expecting
i t . Being a gentle sort, he soon
realised what a shock he had been
and so he grew his hair to live a
sheltered l i f e .
A few years later he joined the
local establishment for infants and
mentally retarded persons from whence
he began to influence people. It was
whilst at this establishment that he
realised that his was to be an acad-
emic career, and he immediately carried
out a l i t t l e personal researoh result-
ing in the Honer classic, "Maniacs, and
how their minds work".
It was not long before London
County Council realised this man's pot-
entialities and sent him to I.C. (This
has since been recognised to be the
greatest move'in C i v i l Defence).
At I.C. Mike felt he had a message
for the poor, uneducated life that he
now found surrounding him, and, in order
to give the same, he Joined the staff of
that venerable old rag, FELIX.

Taking over the editorship of the same (not only was he
the biggest candidate, but also the biggest idiot, and sc
got the Job unopposed) Mike found his influenoo spreading
(at .seat two otherT.C. man oan be seen sporting Honer-
-uaned spectaoles) but this has not gone to his head ( i t
would have been terrible lonesome i f i t had). Inatead h*

FELIX i s not a l l i n the Honor l i f e , there are the mioo
that afford a l i t t l e higher research, and of oourse a l l
the other unmentionable things.
