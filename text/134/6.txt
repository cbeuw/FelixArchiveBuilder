Having hoard the U.C. Orchestra
in their Foundation Concert at the end
of last term and our own orchestra in
the earlier rehearsals of the Session
i t was with some foreboding that toot
oofrespondant attended the orchestral
ooncert given b the College Orchestra.
Doubting very auoh whether the standard
attained by U.C., who had attempted a
very ambitious programme, would be rea-
ched, i t oame as a very pleasant sur-
prise to find that the I.C. Orchestra
oould hold i t s own while s t i l l playing
within i t a technical limitations.
Perhaps the only way in which i t
oould be faulted was in the. volume of
sound produced. This was a continual
mezso-forte whioh tended to rob the
music of some of i t s l i f e , although the
conduotor was as much to blame as the
orchestra for this. The effect was
most noticeable during the Mozart
Symphony, and to a lesser extent in
the "Letter Scene" from Eugene Onegin,
in whioh Miss Daphne G i l l was the solo-
ist.
Miss S i l l displayed her vocal tal-
ents to the full in the scene, yet i t
was unfortunate that the orchestra ten-
ded to drown her voice when singing in
the lower registers, where she cannot
command the same power that i s avail-
able to her at higher pitches. The
3oene as a whole was admirably sung
and played. Having the successes of
the symphony and "Letter Soene" behind
i t , the orchestra ended the concert
with Nioolai's Overture "The Merry Wives
of Windsor", during whioh the gaiety of
the music affected orchestra and audio
enoe ali.-.e, giving a rousing finale to
a most enjoyable concert. We look
forward to more like i t during the
coming Session.
The bun-fight, which followed the
concert, enabled artists to appear and
re-appear in their own fields. The
highlights of the entertainment were
Graham silver's appearanoes as a'Palm
Court* violinist whioh would have occ-
upied the whole evening had the aud-
ience had its way; a sonata for two
bassoons by a German composer with an
unpronounoable name, in which the
instrument lived up to i t s other name
of buffoon, and two melodious duets"
for trombone whioh degenerated into
duets for one and a half players owing
to the inability of one of the players
to keep a straight face while playing
and collapsing with mirth in a true
Goon Show style to the greater mirth
of the watoning. Space does not
permit a full resume' of the evening's
entertainment, but let i t be said i n
conclusion may the music sooiety con-
tinue to thrive on the talents of the
College (and R.C.M.) and give enjoy-
ment in the many diverse ways possible
for years to come.

Through the generosity of Mr.
William Selkirk, in 1945, the college
was able to obtain a large house in
Holland Park, f o r use as a H a l l of
Residence f o r Imperial College students.
The house c a l l e d S e l k i r k H a l l provides
lodgings for 15 undergraduate men,
selected from a l l 3 constituent colleges.
The hostel i s completely d i f f e r -
ent i n organisation from a l l the other
I.C. hostels, f o r instance, i n an
evening we a l l dine together with the
warden and h i s wife. Nowhere else
i n I.C. do the d i f f e r i n g spheres o f
student and s t a f f l i f e so deeply
intersect. Since there are only 15
students we a l l get to know each other
well. During the year we formed cut
own f o o t b a l l and cricket teams to play
the Holland Club (I.C. Technicians),
and we have organised several parties
and dances to which the building i s
eminently suited. Amenities include
lounges, radio, gramaphone, telephone,
an excellent catering service, t e a
mashing equipment and No. 26 (a female
speech-therapist hostel just round the
comer). We have our own t r a d i t i o n s
such as Russian bathing and professorial
dinners, and our own trophies which
includes an oar presented by Colonel
Lowry, a brick, a top-hat and a 'reputed
tc be fierce' bandy-legged dog.
For the past 8 years Mr. P..S.H.G.
Thompson, a lecturer i n the department
of Mathematics, has been warden of
Selkirk H a l l . Mr. Thompson and h i s
wife have devoted much of t h e i r . l i v e s
to the welfare of students, i n China
as w e l l as i n London.
Mr. Thompson i s a friendly acade-
mic man who never f a i l s to entertain
with h i s numerous anecdotes. He i s
a well informed and stimulating con-
v e r s a t i o n a l i s t . His long experience
with undergraduates enables him to
understand and help them.
Mrs. Thompson who has a degree i n
biology i s an e f f i c i e n t housekeeper.
She i s sympathetic t o student needs,
and nothing i s too much trouble f o r
t h e i r well-being.
An era i s coming to an end and
students past and present wish Mr.
and Mrs. Thompson a happy retirement
from the somewhat exacting post of
Warden.
Next year Mr. C C S . Seaford,
the college Domestic Bursar, will be
the new Warden. I t will be different
to have a member of the administration
rather than the academic s t a f f , a man
versed in the arts rather than the
sciences, however we hope that he w i l l
have an interesting and enjoyable time
at S e l k i r k H a l l .

Considering the type of weather the
country i s undergoing at the present
time, the recital given by members of
I.C. Musical Society drew a relatively
large s>k11 will to hear a programme of
works by oomposers ranging from Perg-
olesi to Gordon Jaoob. Although the
overall standard of performaoe was high,
the composition of the programme was not
inspiring. There are several com-
petent pianists and cellists in the
oollege whose inclusion in the recital
would hare lent a better balanoe to the
proceedings. As i t was we heard three
violinists and one singer.
The highlight of the recital was
undoubtedly the performaoe of the last
movement of the Cesar Franck sonata
played by Leslie Goldstone (C*G)
accompanied by his sister. This is a
difficult work to play at much slower
speeds than that taken for performance
and a l l credit i s due to the players for
maintaining a very high degree of almost
professional competence throughout,
although at times one felt that the
ohosen speed was a l i t t l e too great and
this had to be masked by considerable
overpedalling on the piano.
Perhaps the most unfortunate
choice i n the whole programme was the
t i t l e of soprano for Alexandra Mills
(ROM). Her voioe range, as shown in
one of four "Songs of the Hebrides" i s
oortainly limited and i t was felt that
even mezzo-soprano would be rather am-
bitious at times. The songs she
ohose, three seventeenth century songs
by Pergolesi and Scarlatti and the
Hebridean Songs mentioned above, left
one rather cold, and in the higher
register gave the soloist no l i t t l e
difficulty at times.
Graham Silver (RSM) gave one of
his usual teohnioally dazzling per-
formances with the Praeludiua and Allegro
by Kreialer and a Spanish Danoe by de
Falls. Judging from performances later
in the day, however, his talent seems
somewhat misplaced in works of this
kind. At times during the Kreisler
work his bowing tended to be a l i t t l e
indistinct, and another violinist
disliked the fingering used, yet on the
whole i t was a very pleasing performance.
Last en the programme was the Prel-
ude, Passaoaglia and Fugue by Gordon
Jaoob played by Harold Allan and Ste-
fan Wipf (RCM). The first impression
of the work was that i t was a bagpipe
accompaniment to a further Hebridean
song. Possibly i t was the work itself
or the unusual instrumental combination
whioh added to the affect, but there
seemed to be no semblance of order, apax
from the construction of the fugue and i
recap of the theme of the prelude
towards the end. A performance later
in the day dispelled a l l doubts. At
the seoond hearing i t was unquestionably
better performed and the type of noise
requested by the composer more comfort-
able to the ear giving a rather pleasant
modern chamber work. Perhaps more
practice is the answer?
