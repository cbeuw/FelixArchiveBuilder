Welcome to the Christmas special! For those
of you who are new to the end-of-term puzzle
page, the p u z z l e s are of t w o types. T h e
unmarked puzzles are for amusement only,
and tend to be less than serious in nature. The
sworded puzzles, on the other hand, each
carry a £5 prize in the usual way, and there is
also a £10 voucher (redeemable at Mend-a
Bike) for the person who answers the most
sworded puzzles correctly.
Answers to me at the F E L I X Office by
1:00pm on the first Wednesday of next term. If
you submit answers to more than one puzzle,
there is no need to write the answers o n
separate slips of paper.
t Taking Notes
Barney McCabe has put so much time
and effort into discovering the most
irresponsible method for disposing £3000
ofUnion money that he is naturally quite
keen to protect the piano in question, and
to this end he has put it at the back ofthe
music store for the duration of tonight's
party. Unfortunatelyhehasn't yet worked
out how to get it out again...
The difficulty arises on two counts.
Firstly, there's no room to turn any ofthe
objects round without damaging them, so
he will have to get the piano out by sliding
things backwards and forwards without
turning them round.
And secondly, there's an officious
security regulation which prohibits him
from moving anything out ofthe cupboard
(i.e. offthe shaded area) unless he is going
to remove it, and the only thing he needs
to remove is the grand piano. Any offers
of help?
Thanks to...Oliv o Miotto, Dr John Conway,
and Grey Spider. G o o d luck, Merry Christ-
mas, and i-o i-o i-o!
Last Week's Solution
Blanche had just castled on the queen's side.
So Wodge was able to deduce that her King's
rook was unable to escape from his original
corner, and so the rook on Q 3 must be a
promoted pawn. But White can only have
made such a promotion if Black has moved her
king. (This can be deduced from the pawn
structure.) So Black cannot castle. With this
deduction made, White must castle (as indeed
she did) and it is then a simple matter to force
mate in the required number of moves.
As many of you pointed out, the solution to
the previous week's puzzle was wrongly
printed in last week's FELIX. The (unique)
correct solution is shown in the diagram.
