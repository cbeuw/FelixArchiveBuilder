Not much to say this week really, except I
nope that you enjoy this special Christmas and
sixhundredth issue. Production difficulties have
once more raised their ugly head. Having dec-
ided to spend a week and a half producing a
bigger, special issue everything seemed to be set
for a smooth run. However the typesetter oper-
ator fell ill and two days were lost before a tem-
porary operator was employed to replace her for
the last three days of last week. This meant that
we have to work through the weekend and have
had the normal measure of late nights and two
more days work to boot. Such is life.
I C - Q E C Merger
Following last Wednesday's Board of Studies
meeting (the College's highest academic commi-
ttee) it seems that the Rector has come up with
an amended draft proposal which is much more
acceptable. This will be discussed by another
Board of Studies meeting today. Thus we will
know the final draft proposal which will be put to
Governing Body in time for the Emergency
U G M on Thursday (at l p m in M e c h Eng 220).
So if you want to find out exactly what is now
proposed you should turn up to that meeting and
let your views be known.
The year so far
It hardly seems like a term is over already.
From the security of my office it is sometimes
difficult to gauge feeling at College, but I think
it's been a really dull p e r i o d , with little
happening to fire the imagination apart from
the R C S Centenary celebrations. Rag Week
c o n t a i n e d the u s u a l m a d n e s s , but the
lack of any new ideas was disappointing.
As far as IC Union goes, it seems that things
are ticking over once more with the President
soft soaping College and generally being so
diplomatic that they're going to trample all
over him (and us!) if he's not careful. It's all
very well trying to be "reasonable" but we have
to consider the interests of the students. His
sluggish response over the Q E C merger and
(barely) token opposition to the mid-sessional
rent rise for next term is worrying. Barney
M c C a b e seems to be fulfilling the worst of my
expectations, but at least he's exhibiting some
-ort of charade- and isn't half as boring as the
other two.
As lor me, ! m tired again.
