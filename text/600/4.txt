Phew! What a Scorcher!
Strewth! What a bore!
I C U Council met on M o n d a y of this week. T h e meeting was
even longer a n d more arduous than usual with the proposed
IC Q E C merger taking u p well over an hour. T h e sabbaticals
were also censured by the meeting for being 20 minutes late.
By shortly alter 6:00pm approximately 30 members of C o u n c i l had
assembled in the S C R , but the C h a i r m a n , Nick M o r t o n a n d the
Deputy President and H o n Sec were not in attendance. The meeting
was opened at 6:15pm and a motion of censure proposed by M a r t i n
T a y l o r was passed by an overwhelming majority.
W h e n the sabbaticals eventually arrived the meeting heard reports
from most U n i o n Officers and then passed on to the I C Q E C motion.
This was proposed by M a r t i n Taylor, External Affairs Officer, who.
after making a proposal speech, had to answer a long series of
questions. A n amendment to delete all ol the motion a n d simply
oppose the merger was defeated. After one and a quarter hours the
motion was eventually passed by a substantial majority.
The meeting also discussed the purchase of a new baby grand piano
for the Concert H a l l . Some members felt that the expenditure of/2,600
had been made without adequate consultations.
A l t e r f i n a l l y a p p r o v i n g the E x e c u t i v e a n d other c o m m i t t e e
meetings, the meeting eventually finished at 10:20pm.
Pass the sick

Shaky Chair
A recent report in ,\'ni' Scientist
stated that I C was in danger of
losing its gift of a Leverhulme
grant to fund a chair in biotech-
nology.
The report (.Xen Scientist. Dec3)
s u g g e s t e d t h a t I C c o u l d not
"come up with the new posts the
c h a i r r e q u i r e s " a n d that the
Leverhulme Trust might have to
place its money elsewhere.
In fact, the difficulty lies in
f u n d i n g the b a c k - u p facilities
(including research stall) since
the grant will only cover the new
Professor's salary'.

Hordes of merry students crammed- every available space in College
earlier in the week to enjoy the unexpected spell of good weather. T h e
happy revellers pelted each other with snowballs and built snowmen. A
group effort by C i v E n g 2 produced the excellent "snow l i o n " (above)
alongside the real lions at the bottom of the Queens Tower.
Barney's grand new baby
Deputy President Barney M c C a b e , recently purchased a brand new
baby grand piano for the U n i o n Concert H a l l . T h e piano, which cost
^Â£2,635 and was purchased from Harrods, has become the subject of
some controversy.
A meeting of House Committee approved the money for the piano.
However, discussions about a replacement for the present piano, which
is in an appalling state, have been taking place between the D P and
interested groups (such as M u s i c Society and Operatic Society) for
some time. These groups had advised that a reconditioned lull-size
grand piano should have been bought, at approximately the same cost.
By the time they heard that their advice was to be disregarded the new
piano had already been paid for and it was too late lor objections to be
raised. Members of Council who disagreed with the purchase were
similarly unable to reverse the decision, due to a rare example of
efficiency and swift action on the part of the Deputy President.
