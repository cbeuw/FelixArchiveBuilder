I Splinter had a nightmare. He dreamt that he
! was playing Wodge at the chess club, and for
I the first time in his life he was winning. The
] game had reached a point where he was about
' to give checkmate in one move, but to his
I horror he played another move entirely, giving
' the position shown in diagram 1.
At this point he woke up in a cold sweat,
'"but soon he settled down to an uneasy
1
sle'ep once more. Astonishingly he had
'• exactly the same dream, except that this time
the position after his blunder was that of
' diagram 2.
Twice more the dream was repeated, and on
each repetition Splinter's mistake left the
pieces one square further down the board
' (diagrams 3 and 4.)
And now Splinter can't get back to sleep
I because he's pondering the four positions,
\ wondering in each case what move he played,
and what move he should have played to give
checkmate. Can you help him? In each case
Splinter is white, and playing up the board. All
four problems have unique solutions.
