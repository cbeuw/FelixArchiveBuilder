Although Friday has been the favourite day
for publication, that has not always been so.
The freshers' edition of 1957 was published on
a Saturday, while A . T . Pawlowicz (1962/3) and
D.J. Williams (1965/6) had particular aversions
to Fridays (of course Mark Smith only ever
publishes on Fridays).
B a s i c a l l y the e d i t o r i a l style of F E L I X
remained the same until the last issues of the
58/59 session (nos. 134, 135) when under the
editorship of M.R. Honer comparisons and
correspondence with editors of other student
newspapers in London began.
The problem was students at Imperial
thought FELIX was not of the same quality of
other student publications and i m p r o v e d
printing methods and the higher cost ensued
could only be achieved by capital investment.
The only way to achieve this was advertising.
The editor totally disagreed with advertising
and also asked who would want to advertise in
such a paper.
The dilemma remained until the following
editorial appeared in 155:
Edltmiat Comment
Y O U R " H E W L O O K " F E L I X .
Well, here it is. Y o u m a y t h i n k it is
rather small so here are a few facts and
figures to explain w h y . T h e w e t of print-
ing an eight page F E L I X b y the method
tned before, that is the " o f f s e t " process,
was about £18.
You, our readers, contributed regularly
shout £ 1 5 towards t h i s ; the r e m a i n i n g £ 3
or so being m a d e u p f r o m she U n i o n
funds.
The paper which you are reading now
has cost £28 to print, a n d only four pages
at that I T h i s leaves a deficit of £ 1 3 . It
is hoped that most of this w i l l be regained
in future by selling advertising space at
the rates shown elsewhere, b u t for the t i m e
being this extra oost is being borne by the
Union. L i k e all business ventures we need
a oertain amount of c a p i t a l to start the
ball rolling. S h o u l d o u r financial turnover
from advertising reach higher proportions
then we can go ahead a n d p r i n t larger
copies of F E L I X , b u t for the present we
shall have to be content w i t h these four
pages.

The first advertisements to appear were
small ones (although various hosteleries had
been receiving free publicity for years) and
Lamleys were the most regular customers.
Issue 170 saw a half-page advert by Bristol
Siddley Engines and the freshers' edition of
1962 contained a half-page ad from The Times
(who were to subscribe regularly) and a
complete back page ad by Westminster Bank.
Back to Front
As time passed the front page began to
concentrate more on Union politics with some
splendid headlines:
Quorate Union Meeting
600 Turn Up
No Apathy Here
(No 182)
Surprise! Union Meeting Postponed
(No 186)
NUS AT LAST
(No 187)
and so on
It may be of interest that in issue 222 (Nov
1965) the h e a d l i n e was ' F r e e V o t e for
Presidency' but the time-span of this article (to
the end of 66/67 session) does not include the
time when a free election replaced a Council
vote as a m e t h o d of e l e c t i n g the next
President.
T w o of the major e v e n t s c o n c e r n i n g
students this year have been the resurgence of
C N D , including the march to Hyde Park, and
the controversy surrounding the Rag Mag.
Such events are not new to Imperial. The
cover story of 168 (Friday, November 24,
1981) t o l d of a q u o r a t e U G M a l m o s t
unanimously passing a motion "that I C C N D
be r e - i n s t a t e d f o r t h w i t h ' . If h a d b e e n
disbanded by Council the year before. The
closing sentence of the article was also very
pleasing and, indeed, surprising. 'This was an
usually pleasant and fruitful Union meeting, far
better than the procedure-bound slanging
matches that we sometimes have to endure'.

FELIX 246, May 10 1967
A s m e n t i o n e d a b o v e 1 9 5 8 / 5 9 w a s a
traumatic year for publishing in ICU. While the
thoughts which were to revamp F E L I X were
being born, a controversy arose over the
editor of Phoenix. The winter Phoenix of that
year was edited by D. Irving and included a
very fascist editorial and an attack on Prof
Blackett. However in its defence the magazine
was of a high technical standard and profitable.
M r Irving then fled the country and was
relieved of his post.
H o w e v e r he r e t u r n e d to edit a n o t h e r
publication, the Carnival Times, but his efforts
to include an eight-page supplement of racist
and fascist jokes were thwarted.

T H E NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
The various structural changes throughout
the College are also well documented in
FELIX, especially the work of the architect
Colcutt along Imperial Institute (including the
erection of the Queens Tower), the building of
the U n i o n a n d t h e S o u t h s i d e H a l l s of
Residence. One classic headline was "Slow
P r o g r e s s : S o u t h s i d e n e a r i n g c o m p l e t i o n
asymtotically".
Issue 226 included some very interesting
topics including " M e c h Eng to go metric", a
photo of M i k e being cast and the Editor
e x p l a i n i n g w h y F E L I X no l o n g e r h a d
anonymous columnists!
1966/67 was really the last year of the
original F E L I X as the next session's copies
were totally different in format. However the.
" H o p s " organised by the Union were still going
strong and advertisements for salesgirls still
appeared as it was still a few years before
FELIX was to become a free publication.
People in the news even then included Prof
Abdus Salam and Prof. Eric Laithwaite.
Personally the most exciting thing to emerge
from my reading was the advert for the Carnival
w h i c h a p p e a r e d in i s s u e 246 a n d the
subsequent photo of Jimi Hendrix in 247.
