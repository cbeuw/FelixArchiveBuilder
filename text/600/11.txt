Heavy Metal, Cert AA, directed by Gerald
Pottertort, opens at Odeon Kensington
and all over London tomorrow.
This is an animated film consisting of seven
scenes linked by a green marble representing
ultimate evil in the universe. It is based on the
work of several artists from the well-known
magazine of the same name.
A l t h o u g h the title m a k e s m u c h of the
s o u n d t r a c k it is not r e a l l y n o t i c e a b l e ,
especially if one hasn't heard it before (Devo's
reworking of 'Working in a Coalmine' being
the most memorable track).
The opening scene is of a futuristic and
violence-ridden New York where super-cool
taxi-driver Harry Canyon picks up the first of
many big and beautiful women who are all too
ready to remove their single layer of clothing.
Other story lines include Den, a super-stud
(almost) when in possession of the marble and
'So Beautiful and So Dangerous' which includes
a very funny scene where a crew of spacemen
try to dock a spaceship.
However, the best scene is called Capt.
Sternn' where the evil Captain manages to
acquit himself of more charges than have been
heard at the O l d Bailey this year.
Generally good never conquers evil, but
usually maintains the upperhand.
Basically the film is very sound, with the
seven episodes maintaining the pace well.
An alien spaceship hovers above the Pentagon.
Some of the stories are a little weak and the
animation doesn't always work, but it is a bold
attempt at something new and is on the whole
enjoyable. Don't be put off by the title either,
as the music isn't the most important thing.
Symphony
Orchestra
O n e ' s first i m p r e s s i o n of the Imperial
. C o l l e g e S y m p h o n y O r c h e s t r a c o n c e r t on
November 25th was one of visual splendour.
The orchestra occupied fully two thirds of the
floor space of the Great Hall, and boasted a
v i o l i n s e c t i o n l a r g e f o r a p r o f e s s i o n a l
orchestra. The question in the audience's
collective mind as we waited for maestro
Richard Dickins was, can 1 C S O live up to its
looks?
The first piece on the programme was the
Academic Festival Overture by Brahms, and
the orchestra romped cheerfully through this
tuneful pastiche. Except for a few occasions
when the large first violin section showed less
sensitivity to the melodic line than Richard
D i c k i n s ' e x p a n s i v e g e s t u r e s might h a v e
indicated, the playing, like the piece itself, was
loud, happy, and convincing.
The orchestra was then joined by soloists
Krzysztof Smietana (violin), Richard Higgins
(cello) and Barry Douglas (piano) for the
B e e t h o v e n triple c o n c e r t o . T h e long first
movement is not one of Beethoven's finest
e f f o r t s , a n d a g a i n , the o r c h e s t r a h a d
occasional difficulty following the conductor
through the many tempo changes. In the
second movement things began to pick up. In
the opening bars the I C S O strings, playing
with a richness surely seldom matched by an
a m a t e u r o r c h e s t r a , p r o v i d e d a g o r g e o u s
background for Richard Higgins' bewitching
rst theme. This set the tone for the rest of the
Movement, in w h i c h the s o l o i s t s m a d e
beautiful chamber music, firmly supported by
the I C S O at its most sensitive. The third
m o v e m e n t belonged to the soloists, w h o
dazzled the audience with their virtuosity,
providing a rousing finish to the first half of the
programme.
But it was in the second half that the I C S O
was truly o u t s t a n d i n g . R i m s k y - K o r s a k o v ' s
Scheherazade makes huge demands on an
orchestra: there are technically difficult solos
for many individual players, and treacherous
ensemble passages, all of w h i c h must be
played with an air of effortlessness to be
c o n v i n c i n g . T h e s e difficulties w e r e s u r -
mounted with truly impressive skill. This time,
the o r c h e s t r a f o l l o w e d the c o n d u c t o r ' s
sensitive direction flawlessly, and the lushness
a n d o p u l e n c e of the s o u n d m o r e t h a n
adequately reflected the subject. Leader David
Bogle encountered some intonation problems
in his first solo statement of the theme, but
subsequently found his touch, and played the
difficult violin solos with laudable style. The
wind solos were uniformly excellent, with
special credit going to a superb oboe section.
In the slow movement, the strings managed to
be muted without sounding scratchy, as the
orchestra once again demonstrated the beauty
of its sound.
In all, I C S O performed a daring programme
with professional aplomb.

Prince of the City. Directed by Sidney
Lumet, X, 167 mins. Opens at Warner
West End, ABC Shaftesbury Ave and
ABC Fulham Rd on December 17.
Prince of the City concerns Detective Daniel
Ciello, who is the head of a special narcotics
d i v i s i o n of the N e w Y o r k C i t y P o l i c e
Department which has been given city-wide
jurisdiction and the ability to put together
cases anyway they see fit, and his break with
the r u l e s of c o r r u p t i o n that have been
established in the dealings between cops and
crooks and between cops themselves. A s the
film progresses and Danny goes undercover
for a crime commission he is caught between
the dispassionate truth of the law and the truth
of his friendship with other members of his unit
which is founded on action that transverses
legal boundaries.
It is the divide between impersonal political
power that generates, to Danny, an arbitary
legal framework and the personalised, corrupt
nature of his unit's police work and Danny's
attempt to be judged as 'good' by one yet
salvage the other, that provides the tension
w h i c h t h r e a t e n s to d e s t r o y the c e n t r a l
character.
T h e plot is fiercely unravelled, tearing
through skillfully portrayed scenes of stark
intensity or ritual violence, violence being, in
this almost totally male film, the major way the
characters express themselves or relate to
each other. The simple plot, boldly embel-
lished, is for all its energy finally unable to
sustain the duration of this film, close on three
hours, and the fluid structure ossifies into a
series of scenes where well-heeled lawyers,
who yeild the power to w h i c h D a n n y is
subservient, decide his future. The rigidity of
these few final scenes traps the characters and
invalidates their expression during them.
However, Prince of the City, directed by
S i d n e y L u m e t w h o is t r e a d i n g g r o u n d
superficially similar to that which he did with
Serpicp, is not crippled by its length and much
of the life of this film abides in the barely
sketched characters of New York's seiper
underworld.
