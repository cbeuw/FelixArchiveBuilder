Dear Mark, or may I call,you 'Sir'?
In reply to M r . Richardson's
letter re pricing. M a y I point out
that a very small percentage of
our stock is classified as non-net,-
and even those are sold at the
recommended price. The terms
N E T or N O N N E T only apply to
the British Isles. W i t h regard to
our discount, as the profits made
by the bookshop are used to i m -
prove the students' facilities, I
w o u l d be most grateful if he
could supply our needs even at
35% let alone 40%, and please
could we have 90 days to pay
instead of the normal 30 days.
There is a directory of British
publishers and glancing through
this, I can at this time only find
one publisher who gives 40%.
But, you have to order a m i n -
i m u m of 300 of each title, and
they o n l y p u b l i s h R o m a n t i c
Fiction. W i t h regard pricing in
pencil as a lot ol books come with
no price, we put the price in
pencil as our stickers ruin one's
linger nails when trying to peel
them off.

Dear Mark
I wish to protest most strongly
about the sentiments expressed in
W i l l i a m K i n g ' s letter two weeks
ago concerning Ian Paisley, a
man who shames the godfearing
people of the six countries by his
existence, and your comment on
it.
The Times stated quite unequi-
vocally last week that the " R e v
D r ' s " o n l y q u a l i f i c a t i o n is a
diploma from Ballymena Tech.,
so there. It is well known in
journalistic circles that The Times
cannot be argued with on such
m a t t e r s . P a i s l e y ' s r e p o r t e d
e l e c t i o n successes s h o w h o w
s t u p i d " t h e m a j o r i t y " of his
electorate are.

Dear Mark
I am writing to inform you of a
very disturbing occurence. I am a
resident i n G a r d e n H a l l a n d
since the beginning of term we
have had no laundry facilities, as
our washing machine is in the
process of being moved. This has
meant a weekly trip to Weeks
H a l l to use theirs, an arrange-
ment consented to by the W a r -
den. W e have always endeav-
oured to use the laundry at the
least busy times to cause the
m i n i m u m of inconvenience.
However, this week we arrived
to find that the students (not the
Warden) had asked for the lock
to t h e l a u n d r y d o o r to be
changed to prevent us from using
it. I find this attitude towards
fellow students in need totally
disgusting and a m appalled by
the lengths to which they have
gone to make life difficult for
us. If this is the general attitude
towards fellow students, then the
I C - Q E C merger hasn't got a cat
in hell's chance.

Dear Mark
I w o u l d l i k e to d r a w the
attention of your readers to some
recent incidents in one of the
student houses in Evelyn G a r -
dens.
T w o residents of R o o m 4 G 4 in
Bernard Sunley House have just
been fined £15 each for damage
to their room. They had adorned
t h e w a l l s w i t h w r i t i n g a n d
drawings in black marker pen.
The warden of the house dis-
covered this, purely by chance,
early last week. H e explained to
them that they had committed a
very serious offence and left with
the message that he would come
back to them on the matter.
The following day, the stud-
ents spent several hours cleaning
the walls and there is. now no
mark to be seen. Indeed, it is
quite impossible to tell that there
ever was any graflitti.
T h e warden has seen the walls,
a n d a c k n o w l e d g e s t h a t t h e
students have done an efficient
job-
N e v e r t h e l e s s , he has s t i l l
imposed the £15 fine (which is
h a l f s u s p e n d e d i.e. £ 7 . 5 0 is
returnable at the end of the year,
providing there is no breach of
regulations by these students).
It is highly unlikely that the
Disciplinary Committee would
r e p e a l the fine s h o u l d t h e y
appeal against it.
D o you think that it is fair to
impose such a heavy fine for
damage which has been comp-
letely repaired?
Comments in reply would be
appreciated.
yours

Y o u r c u r r e n t c a m p a i g n a -
g a i n s t M r . N i c k M o r t o n is
disgraceful. Some of the things
you have said in it are tant-
amount to suggesting that not
only is he President of I C U , but
t h a t he r e g u l a r l y c r a w l s to

MOTION ON PROPOSED IC/QEC MERGER
Proposed by: External A f f a i r s Committee.
ICU Notes:
1. The draft statement of intent issued j o i n t l y by the Rector of
Imperial College and the P r i n c i p a l of Queen Elizabeth College on
2nd December 1981.
2. That this draft statement of intent c a l l s for a merger of Imperial
College and QEC biosciences, the extra departments to be
accommodated i n a new building on the I.C. s i t e .
3. That the statement c a l l s f o r a l l the bioscience departments
(including those currently part of the Royal College of Science)
to become a fourth constituent college, Queen Elizabeth College.
4. That the statement c a l l s for closer collaboration between the
colleges and especially between the departments concerned over the
next four to f i v e years before the merger takes place i n 1986.
ICU Believes:
1. That the proposed merger i s i n general acceptable. The expansion
of the college with the provision of a new building and new f i e l d s
of study within biosciences can strengthen the college.
2. That the proposed merger would become unacceptable i f there were
no new building on the IC s i t e to accommodate those parts of QEC
which were to come here and i t were.to result i n a s p l i t s i t e
college.
3. That a l l the physical sciences s t a f f and students must be
accommodated elsewhere i n the university. There must be no
attempt to bring them to I.C. under the guise of being 'bioscience
related'.
4. That the concept of a fourth all-biosciences constituent college
has no h i s t o r i c a l precedent, nor i s i t a p r a c t i c a l proposition.
A l l parts of QEC which i t is.proposed to merge with I.C. must
become part of the D i v i s i o n of L i f e Sciences which must remain an
integral part of the Royal College of Science.
5. That assurances must be given that a) the status of Silwood Park
w i l l remain unchanged; b) the Hall of Residence at QEC w i l l be
maintained and come under the I.C. Student Services Office;
c) that students w i l l be adequately consulted at each stage of the
merger process and s h a l l be represented on the Joint Planning
Committee which i t i s proposed to set up.
6. That further assurances must be given as to the maintenance of
academic standards and entry standards i n a l l parts of I.C., and
the maintenance of student numbers i n the university as a whole.
ICU Resolves:
1. To reaffirm i t s policy on education cuts.
2. To play a f u l l part i n the continuing negotiations surrounding
the merger.
ICU Instructs:
1. A l l Union O f f i c e r s , the Student Observers on Governing Body and
the Student Members of Board of Studies to press for changes i n
the draft statement of intent i n l i n e with the above p o l i c y , with
guidance from the Union Council.
2. That i n the event of the views of the Union as outlined above
being disregarded i n the formulation of plans for a merger, the
External A f f a i r s Committee to refer the matter back to a UGM.
