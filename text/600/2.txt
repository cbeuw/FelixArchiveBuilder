Sir
Y o u have been revealed as a
scandal and a rogue at last. " A
special t h a n k you to P a t r i c k
(guest writer!)" refers to none
o t h e r t h a n P a t r i c k C o l l , a
reprobate if ever I heard of one.
It was not for nothing that he
picked up the nickname "hatchet
j o b " . N o t c o n t e n t w i t h his
nefarious activities last year, his
a t t r o c i o u s w o r k on the I C U
H a n d b o o k a n d the d e p r a v e d
R a g M a g , he has sought to "go
out with a b a n g " to use his own
words.
Is it not true that he now goes
a r o u n d L o n d o n r e c i t i n g a
selection of extremely indecent
poems about C a p t a i n Lindley,
the Least d i s g u s t i n g of w h i c h
begins:
" I laughed on the day that the
Captain,
Was jabbed up the arse with a
hatpin...."
It is clear from your conduct,
sir, that far f r o m seeking to
d i s c o u r a g e h i m f r o m these
activities, you have given him
help and active support.
Y o u both ought to be thorou-
ghly ashamed of yourselves.
Yours truly

Sir
It will be a dangerous prece-
dent for I C to encourage 'positive
discrimination'. In doing so IC
lays itself open to legal action
under the Race Relations Act,
and the publicity given to such a
court case will do nothing to
enhance the reputation of the
College.
W i t h this issue and the prop-
o s e d m e r g e r w i t h Q E C one
w o n d e r s i f L o r d F l o w e r s is
concerned about preserving the
h i g h a c a d e m i c s t a n d a r d s a n d
reputation of I C .

Dear Sir
I w o u l d l i k e to take this
opportunity to congratulate you
on your recent feat of media
manipulation. I refer, of course,
to your treatment of the R a g
M a g saga.
F E L I X e n t e r e d the a r e n a
w i t h a f a r c i a 1 l e t t e r s p a g e
wherein the Editor took it upon
himself to be ridiculously ped-
antic and after exalting people to.
contribute, treated serious letters
with abandon in a manner fully
intended to insult. F E L I X was
also p a r t i a l l y responsible for
c r e a t i n g the m y t h of a huge
Chaplaincy block vote, decrying
t h e i r a u d a c i t y to v o i c e a n
opinion. It was said that those
who voted against the R a g M a g
were responsible lor the loss ol
revenue and that they were the
sort of people who never did
anything to help the Charities. It
should be clearly pointed out
that the responsibility for a loss of
revenue w o u l d lie w i t h those
responsible for p r o d u c i n g the
R a g M a g .
Finally, I find myself asking
three questions:
1) Are we going to see a repeat of
last year's dire editorial rantings
with the Chaplaincy replacing
Dave Alblabi as the pel hate?
2) A r e Editors so incapable of
presenting lucid arguments that
they must Find some aspect ol
their opponent's nature on which
to base a slur campaign?
3) Does the Editor really feel that
he should base his style on that of
Goebbels?

it makes me feel sick that the
people who voted to recirculate
the R a g M a g claimed that they
were doing it in the name of
charity. I a m quite certain that
none of those hypocrites care at
all about the deaf children, as
they e v i d e n t l y d o n ' t care for
anyone suffering from any other
kind of handicap.
A t the end of the previous
U G M , a collection was taken to
r e c o u p loss c a u s e d b y t h e
banning of the magazine. As it is
now back in circulation, I would
like my money back, as I intend
to give it to some other charity-
one which raises money by less
dubious means
There are many things that the
handicapped need more than
money, such as sympathy and
understanding, which the R a g
M a g is trying to destroy. N o
a m o u n t o f m o n e y c a n e v e r
compensate people for the loss of
that.
If anyone wants to know about
charities which need actual help,
please contact me, especially if
you will be here over X m a s week.

Sir
O n M o n d a y lunchtime a large
group of stalf and students from
the Life Sciences Division turned
up to a hastily arranged meeting
lo hear the Rector speak about
the proposed merger of QF2C
Biological Sciences Dept and that
of I C .
O E C has about 500 biology
students. I C has only 200, with a
f u r t h e r 250 B i o c h e m i s t s . T h i s
merger is thus not a swamping by
IC. The merger was a popular
option amonst Q E C staff when
they were offered several ideas for
ensuring the college's survival in
a recent ballot.
This act of " c h a r i t y " on the
part of the Rector is not seen as
such by Life Scientists. There has
b e e n no c o n s u l t a t i o n w i t h
s t u d e n t s or staIT u n t i l t h i s
meeting and we were given only
2 davs to say if we agreed in
principle with the idea (though
what would happen if we didn't
he would, not say). W i t h only 10
days to the end of term, it would
be difficult to change the draft
proposals.
S e v e r a l q u e s t i o n e r s a s k e d
w h e t h e r L i f e Sciences w o u l d
have any say in its own future.
T h e Rector would only reply
"Since when have we done things
by formal ballot?"
So it seems that Life Sciences is
indeed to be sacrificed in order to
placate the U G G when we have
b e e n a s k e d to i n c r e a s e o u r
numbers (a move which the dept
took as meaning a strenghtening
of the new and vital aspects of
biology at IC).
T h e R e c t o r m e n t i o n e d a n
increase in income " U p to £4.5
m i l l i o n " - Q E C ' s current budget.
H o w e v e r , as the b i o l o g i c a l
sciences is o n l y h a l f of the
c o l l e g e ' s a c t i v i t i e s a n d the
remaining £1 million would be-
taken care of by "the cuts" it is
difficult to find justification lor
this statement.
W i l l Life Sciences be allowed a
voice in its own future?

Dear Editor
I feel I must clarify one or two
points that appear in your article
'Getting together with Q . E . C . ' of
2 0 t h N o v e m b e r . F i r s t l y the
f a c t u a l m i s t a k e s . T h e m a i n
building of our College houses
P h y s i c s , F o o d S c i e n c e a n d
Physiology and not Microbiology
and Nutrition as you incorrectly
stated.. T h e A t k i n s b u i l d i n g
houses the r e m a i n i n g d e p a r t -
ments of C h e m i s t r y , B i o l o g y ,
B i o c h e m i s t r y , M i c r o b i o l o g y ,
Nutrition, Maths etc.
There is no U . G . C . Budget for
Q . E . C . as you have stated in
y o u r t h i r d p a i a g a r a p h . T h e
2 . 7 4 m is t h e a l l o c a t i o n f o r
Q . E . C . from the court of the
University. This is 13.9% less
than was received from the court
of the University in the previous
year.
O u r s t u d e n t s t a k e g r e a t
exception to being labelled as
pretty left wing'. W e merely feel
strongly about the future of our
college a n d object to r a d i c a l
decisions being made above our
heads without consultation. The
Education Cuts are affecting us
severely a n d (as we believe)
u n f a i r l y . It is a n u n f o r t u n a t e
state ol affairs when 'activity'
becomes labelled as 'left-wing'
and apathy, as 'right-wing'.
Q . E . C . S . U . is only p r o - N . U . S .
because it is the only way our
s t u d e n t s c a n get t h e i r v i e w s
voiced on substantial issues at a
regional or national level. W e
object s t r o n g l y to the r a t h e r
biased attitude to N . l ' . S . and our
involvement with that organ-
i s a t i o n . W e c e r t a i n l y are not
antagonistic', but in a totally
d i l l e r e n t e n v i r o n m e n t to the
average I.C. student. I would ask
you and your students to bear
this in m i n d . If a merger should
arise then it is important that
both Student Unions do their
best to protect their membership
from unnecessary inconvenience.
The somewhat devisive attitude
expressed in your article does
nothing to promote openmind-
edness among your mem!)ers (or
ours for that matter).
Y o u r closing statement that 'a
d e c i s i o n w h e t h e r o r n o l to
collaborate will be taken by the
governing body by about Dec-
ember" totally under plays the
seriousness of the s i t u a t i o n . I
h o n e s t l y w o n d e r i f I m p e r i a l
C o l l e g e s t u d e n t s h a v e a n y
sensible views at a l l , because if
they have they ought to start
expressing them or the whole
business will IK- done Ix-ibre a
student view is considered.
I hope that this letter may
provoke some of your students to
consider the situation in a more
critical but open-minded fashion.
T h e problems of affiliation to
N . U . S . arc s e c o n d a r y to the
immediate issue at stake and its
implications.

Dear Sir
I have heard it rumoured that
N . U . S . stands for N a s t y U n -
washed Students. Perhaps you
could let me know whether or not
this r u m o u r is unfounded.

E d ' s N o t e : I always thought that
it stood for National U n i o n of
Semen, but maybe you're right.
A n y other suggestions?
