CLUBS AND SOCIETIES
G o
G o is potentially the most successful of the
intellectual games, including chess, bridge
or bird watching. This may be proved at South
Side or abroad.
It is a strategic board game for two players, a
war game with art, if you like.
Regarding its origins, go is an oriental game.
It is thousands of years old. It is not too difficult
to experiment and see that go is simpler and
more interesting than any otber board or card
game. The matchless simplicity of the rules
makes it easy to learn quickly, but it can take a
lifetime to get the most from the game. It
is enjoyable not only to experienced players
but also to beginners and tbey can play each
other, because the differences can be levelled
by a very natural handicap system.
The game is played by placing black and
white men, astonishingly called stones, one by
one in t u r n o n the go b o a r d , o v e r the
intersection of the lines. The aim is to share
the territory which is given by the 181 points
available on the board (19 by 19 intersections).
There is no way of ending in a draw. The
winner is the player, who after the ending
arrangements has formed group of stones in
such a way that they are surrounding larger
number of unoccupied positions that that
achieved by the opponent.
The stones positioned in the beginning are
just laying claim for areas. Sooner or later the
local situation can sharpen into a dispute and
farther on into a fight for life.
The actual playing ends when there is an
agreement about it, that is when it becomes
clear that there is no chance or possibility of
increasing territory either in a peaceful way or
by making stones prison or killing them. It may
look a bloody game and that is it for nasty
people.
To reactivate the go club this year again in
the College there is a need of 20 signatures for
start of people interested in playing the game

Meetings will be held as usual once or twice a
week in Stan's (South Side over the running
pints). If interested, please contact the people
you can find in small ads.

If all went a c c o r d i n g to plan, I.C. A n g l i n g
C l u b b e c a m e the newest club in R . C . C . last
night. W e will be getting headed notepaper
soon! M a l c o l m B r a i n w o u l d be p r o u d of us.
Activities have been low key recently,
with a tiddler-snatching session on the
G r a n d U n i o n C a n a l a n d a non-event at
W a l t h a m s t o n reservoirs. The last trip for
this term is this w e e k e n d (contact Dave
K e l s a l l , C h e m . E n g . P G , int. 2594 for
details).
Next term we shall be fishing on the
following weekends:
16/17th J a n .
30/31st J a n .
13/14th Feb.
27/28th Feb.

event)
O n e of those w e e k e n d s c o u l d be a sea

O n a final note, we will be off to Ireland
next summer. Places will be strictly limited.
If you are interested in visiting the a n g l i n g

I find it very sad (to say the least) that at a
time w h e n world poverty is at an all time
h i g h a n d c o n t i n u e s to be a n i n s u l t to
h u m a n i t y , w h e n the U K G o v e r n m e n t ' s
indifference to major international issues
results in savage cuts in foreign aid. big
c u t s in u n i v e r s i t y e d u c a t i o n a n d the
t r a i n i n g of o v e r s e a s s t u d e n t s , a n d the
blatant disregard of m u c h of the U N ' s
w o r k , n e a r l y e v e r y o n e i n t h e c o l l e g e
chooses to sit back and forget about it all.
T h e U N society is striving to enlighten
m e m b e r s of college on these matters a n d
to c a m p a i g n on them, but because of a
very poor r e s p o n s e to a request for vacant
c o m m i t t e e p o s t s to be f i l l e d at the_
beginning of term, very little has been
done. I w o u l d urge anyone who has the
slightest interest or c o n c e r n about world
p o v e r t y a n d d e v e l o p m e n t , m u l t i l a t e r a l
disarmament, a n d university education in
t h e i n t e r n a t i o n a l a n d n a t i o n a l c o n t e x t
(areas not covered by other societies in the
college) to c o m e to a brief meeting on
T h u r s d a y D e c e m b e r 17 ( t o m o r r o w ) at
1.00pm in the U n i o n U p p e r L o u n g e and
volunteer to contribute in the r u n n i n g of
the society. If a g o o d strong committee is
f o r m e d o n l y a m o d e s t c o n t r i b u t i o n is
required from each committee member.

Tonight is, of course-your last chance to
enjoy yourself before heading back to the
provinces. I refer to the 'Xmas ... at last' party
with ' A Blue Zoo' and ' W a pa cha' both bands
achieving good reactions at recent London
d a t e s a n d b o t h h i g h l y d a n c e a b l e . A l s o ,
cartoons starring T o m , Jerry and Pink Panther
- who have just returned from a world wide
tour, Crimbo disco and bars, which go without
saying really! What more can £1 buy you?
Tomorrow is the last film of term - Smokey
and the Bandit Ride Again and next term sees
s u c h films as Star Trek, McVicar, Flash
Gordon, Airplane, Being There, China
Syndrome, Any Which Way You Can and The
Great Rock'n'Roll Swindle. C a n you afford to
miss even one of these?
Special thanks must go to I.C. Union, Guilds
for the use of their Gestetner and our many
helpers. Finally - 'Merry Xmas ... at last!'

Certain recommended books for the coming
Term have had quite large price increases. It is
as you know the publisher who decides on the
price, not the booksellers. Think before you
buy as we cannot refund money. Better still,
check there are not any of the old price still in
stock. Rest assured they will be in the front so
do not disrupt the whole shelf my staff spend a
large amount of time trying to keep the shop
tidy.
