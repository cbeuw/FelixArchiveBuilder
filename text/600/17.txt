Crisis at Xmas
Christmas is a time to remember the
homeless, being turned away from one
place after another because there is no
room? For the homeless of London, there
is a shelter each year during Christmas
week in a Church Hall in Whitechapel. If
you have any old clothes, or any food that
you don't want to take home (and which
will keep until Christmas!) please give it to
any I C C A G member, or bring it to the
I C C A G room on Monday lunchtime.
If y o u c a n s p a r e a n y t i m e d u r i n g
Christmas week to help at the shelter,
please contact Fiona Sinclair, internal 2847,
for further details.
If you think that you are badly off, come
and find out what it is really like to be poor
(remember that the homeless can't get
social security).
We served 700 dinners on Christmas Day
last year, so you can see we need a lot of
help.
A n d then the centenary was gone.
Culminating in the Ball, a marvelous event,
possibly the best seen in college, certainly the
best within the last ten years. If you missed it,
bad luck but you've only yourself to blame,
and its your loss. Hopefully we will keep up the
standards with the annual dinner in the spring
term and the Silwood Ball in the summer, so
there's something to look forward to.
Have a nice time, don't worry Rag is in hand,
see you around, Merry Xmas, Where's by
birthday present?
It's the R S M Bar Night tonight - Union Bar

few songs with our foreign student visitors.
The R S M U G M is tomorrow, in G20 at
12.45pm This U G M is specially for the foreign
students week, and will include presentations
and songs from all (or most) of the 8 countries
represented. So come along and say hello -
you never know, you might meet them again if
you go on their foreign students week!!!
Today, (5.00pm) is the last day to get your
Mines Ball ticket - post dated cheques until
early next term are accepted!
City 0? Guilds
Apologies for the lack of Guilds article last
week - it was due to severe inefficiency on my
part - sorry. This week there's nothing much to
mention except the theatre trip tonight, so if
you want to see 'Caught in the Act' at the
Garrick theatre there may still be some tickets
left - (Steve says it's a really good play) - come
to the Guilds office as soon as poss!
There are no more 'Official' Guilds events so
have a wonderful Christmas, don't work too
hard (!!!) Be good. Lots of love.

The A l l o m C u p Regatta
The A l l o m C u p regatta (organized by the
University of L o n d o n Boat Clubs for U L
clubs) is rowed at Chiswick. I . C . B . C . entered
eight crews and two scullers and the results
were as follows:
1st VIII entered 'open eights' and beat Guys
Hospital in the first round and then lost by
1/2 length to Kings College in the final.
2 n d VIII entered senior ' C eights, just won
the 1st round against St. M a r y ' s and Kings
and won the final easily beating ??
Senior ' C IV, a scratch crew who had never
rowed together managed to beat L o n d o n
Hospital in the first round. T h e n in the final
they beat U . C . H . easily and forced a dead
heat with Q . M . C . In the re-row they beat
Q . M . C . by 2 lengths.
Novice VIII's W e had two entrys to the
Novice V I I I division. These crews consisted
of people who had not rowed before this
term. Due to the bad conditions the ' A ' crew
managed to put a sizable hole in their boat
before reaching the start. They had to row
their race in the ' B ' crew's boat. This was
possible since the ' B ' crew lost their first race
the ' A ' crew went on to do the same.
Womens' ' A ' IV entered Womens O p e n 4s,
and got a bye to the final then lost to L o n d o n
Hospital and C h a r i n g Cross.
Womens' ' B ' IV entered Womens Novice
IV's, beat Q . M . C . and St. M a r y s in the 1st
round and narrowly lost in the second round.
Sculls B. Bradbury lost in O p e n Sculls event
but won the Senior ' C sculls. A . M c C o n n e l l
won Novice Sculls.
A l l in all the day was a mixture of disaster

Reading Novice Regatta
T h i s e v e n t is o r g a n i z e d by R e a d i n g
University Boat C l u b for crews of oarsmen
and oarswomen who have not rowed before
this term. T w o mens VIII's were entered.
W e set off at 8am from Paddington Station
and when we got to R . U . B . C . at about 9
o ' c l o c k the boats h a d not a r r i v e d . T h i s
caused minor consternation as the first race
was at 10am and the boats had to be put
together. However they soon turned up and
the rowing got under way. T h e ' A ' crew lost
first to Clare College (the eventual winners).
The ' B ' crew quickly followed suit losing to
Fitzwilliam and Churchill.
In the repercharge event the ' A ' crew came
back from 3rd position to w i n by a reasonable
margin from Jesus College and Oxford Poly.
In the second round the crew had a good 1st
half and then due to the superior fitness of the
opposition, they lost. T h e ' B ' crew had a 'not
so hot' start in their race and lost.
The day was not quite the resounding
success that it could have been but everybody
enjoyed themselves and the boats came back
in one piece (for a change?).

Firsts
At last we found another college that play
on Wednesdays! Bedford came to Harlington
with visions of beating the invicible I.C. side.
Before the game their captain was overheard
saying that Bedford had not lost for 6 weeks
and were top of the league. A n d y soon shut
him up with 4 goals and Geoff added 2 more.
J o n at last found the net from a short-corner
and to add to Bedfords' misery finally scored
with a penalty that only just reached the line.

Seconds
The day started normally enough, about
20 minutes late! This was to have serious
consequences as further delays led to us
arriving late at the H a r r o w ground. Once the
match started it was obvious that the team
had neglected to change from Greenwich
M e a n T i m e to H a r r o w M e a n T i m e with the
result that H a r r o w started playing al the
appointed time and we had just about woken
up by half time. However, despite intense
p r e s s u r e a n d s o m e r a t h e r o v e r z e a l o u s
umpiring, H a r r o w were only 1-0 up at hall
time.
This could have been wiped out early in
the second half if Phil W e b b had not tried to
engage his brain when faced with a clear
shot, the resulting panic-stricken pirouette
sent a clod of turf goalward while the ball
remained undisturbed! Further efforts from
Phil and M a n g a t Bansal failed to produce an
equaliser and the game was put out of our
reach by a line H a r r o w goal late in the
second half This followed a save from Paul
B u t l e r t h a t w o u l d h a v e b e e n t h o u g h t
p h y s i c a l l y i m p o s s i b l e by a n y n o r m a l
standards! W h i l e falling over one way he
managed to produce a foot flying in the

goalkeeper was bar secretary.
