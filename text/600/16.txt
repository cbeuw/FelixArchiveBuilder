Dear Santa
H a v i n g been good all year, I thought I'd write to tell you what a few
people around here should get for Christmas. Please try to do your best
this year and bring the following:
For Q E C — 14 Montpelier St.
J o h n S m i t h (College Secretary) — " H o w to W r i t e Letters
W h i c h get Results" by J o h n Smith O B E .
D r D o n M o n r o — "101 ways to use a Dead C a t " .
Nick M o r t o n — knee pads and a jar of vaseline.
Barney M c C a b e — music lessons and an alarm clock.
Captain Lindley — a set of detailed instructions so that he can
open last year's bottle of Matey Bubble Bath.
Dave Thompson — "Debrett's Etiquette" (urgent!)
and for the stall' of F E L I X
Lesley Horrocks (Sports Editor) — a big black man.
Peter Rodgers — an autographed photo of Ian Paisley.
James Deeny — deed poll form.
J . M a r t i n T a y l o r — an interesting speech to read.
Scaramouche — G r a n d baby causes annoyance (anag?).
M a r k Smith — a bullwhip to encourage the stall.

The Name Game
S c a r a m o u c h e s Anagrams
Response to the anagram competition was pretty dismal; only six people
bothered to enter, but nevertheless the entries supplied in quality what
they lacked in quantity.
Chris Humphries of Physics offered T H E R E S T I N G L E P E R as an
anagram of P H I L G R E E N S T R E E T . H e also pointed out that G R E E N
L E P E R S H I T is only one letter out. A rather more appropriate (and
tasteful) anagram for the same gentleman was suppled by 'Eric' Jarvis:
H E L E N ' S P E R T T I G E R .
W . Geal, a technician from C h e m E n g , supplied over sixty assorted
scramblings (so that's what technicians do all day) the best of which
included J . S . Oakley — A S L Y J O K E ( M r Oakley is Departmental
Superintendent of C h e m Eng) and V I C T O R M O O N E Y — T O Y
M I C R O O V E N .
Since no one submitted anything decent lor C A P T A I N L I N D L E Y , I
had a go and managed to find C A P ' N : T D E N Y I T A L L ' and also I,
C A P T A I N which anagrams to P A I N A T I C .
But the prizewinners are in a class of their own. After several hours of
deliberation, M a r k Smith and I decided to award second prize to Sean
O'Boyle for I M P E R I A L C O L L E G E O F S C I E N C E A N D T E C H -
N O L O G Y anagramming into O N E P L A C E O F M I N C E D L O G I C
T H E Y A L L R E C O G N I S E . But first prize goes to J o h n of Selkirk who
can claim his Christmas pud as soon as he tells me his surname. H i s entry
anagrams V I C T O R Y M O O N E Y in a highly topical reference to that
awfully embarrassing refectory knocking shop: V I C E R O O M ? Y N O T !
C o m i n g next term!
Don't miss
January
February
and (with luck)
March
