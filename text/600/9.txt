The real horror of
Linstead
Linstead Hall is the most recently built of
IC's accommodation for students and has the
best self-catering provision in college halls,
particularly in the recent extension, where
there is at least one kitchen per ten residents.
Despite this, Linstead is the only hall to have
an evening meal served every weekday for
which students must pay at the beginning of
term with their room fees. The meals cost
£1.50 each: residents may obtain a refund of
slightly less than this for up to two meals per
week by signing out.
There is widespread dissatisfaction with this
service. The U n i o n report on the recent
refectories questionnaire is noticeably 'soft' on
the college catering services in some areas, but
the section on the Linstead service is headed
' T h e real h o r r o r of L i n s t e a d ' . T h e quest-
ionnaire results revealed that 'huge majorities
felt the meal was not hot enough, badly served
and presented and that something was wrong
with the food itself. There were complains
about 'soggy food', undercooking, 'terrible'
meat a n d fish, ' d r y m a s h ' , ' o v e r c o o k e d
cauliflower', 'soggy pastry', 'melted ice cream',
as well as about 'the behaviour and appear-
ance of staff; 'obnoxious and filthy' was one'.
According to the report 'residents do not feel
they get value for money', and the last of its
eleven conclusions is: 'The food in Linstead is
totally unacceptable. This situation must be
reviewed immediately'.
Meat in Linstead's meals is frequently visibly
undercooked - this is not only aesthetically
offensive but also a danger to health. There
have been several 'actual case(s) and rumours
of food poisoning'* already this term, and
a l t h o u g h o b v i o u s l y the s o u r c e of t h e s e
infections cannot be determined definitely,
m a n y r e s i d e n t s are c o n v i n c e d that the
Linstead meals were responsible. Cutlery is
frequently coated with greasy fingerprints and
sometimes carries visible remnants of the
previous day's meal; plates and bowls are
rarely even apparently clean and are often wet.
Leaving aside considerations of hygiene, the
meals are very rarely wholly satisfactory to a
majority of the residents. Meat served without
sauce and fish are usually at best lukewarm:
vegetables are uninspiring in general. Portion
size is another source of c o m p l a i n t . T h e
amount of meat presented is usually in inverse
proportion to its tolerability, while chips, one
of the few items which are anywhere near
regularly acceptable, are always provided in
totally inadequate amounts.
Despite the effective financial loss incurred,
some Linstead residents attend less than three
meals per w e e k s i m p l y b e c a u s e of the
unattractiveness of the food.
Overall the meals are often described as
'worse than college refectory food', there being
at least a choice of food in the main college
refectories. The personal hygiene of some of
the catering staff is viewed with suspicion by
many residents^
Linstead Hall was built with money from an
anonymous benefactor who stipulated that
students should eat in hall; other schools of the
University received similar donations at the
same time. IC secretary John Smith says the
intention of the benefactor was to 'improve the
quality of student life' in L o n d o n by the
introduction of this 'Oxbridge' system of meals
in hall. W h e n Linstead's extension was built,
enquiries were made about the possibility of a
change in the system, but these revealed a
fairly 'firm attitude' against such a change.
However, M r . Smith thought that in view of
the 'rapidly changing eating habits' of students
the matter must be looked into again.
The present service may fit the letter of the
conditions attached to the donation, but it can
hardly be in the spirit of the benefactor's
intention if the meals only serve to unite
residents in their dissatisfaction with the food.

A Christmas
Tale
With Christmas approaching the thoughts
of most o r d i n a r y folks turn to food a n d
festivities (unless they've already been in the
orientation for some time already). However,
such things don't happen in the peculiar world
of S c i e n c e a n d T e c h n o l o g y . I n s t e a d we
concentrate on that fine old institution, the
Christmas test.
This reminds me of an occasion some years
ago when two aging Professors, both F R S ,
began at first contemplating, next discussing
and finally arguing about the quality of their
freshmen. However, preserving a sense of
dignity they decided that the noble way to
settle this was on the results of the Christmas
test.
It has long been accepted in the depts and
indeed anywhere academics frequented that
the Christmas tests of eight years ago had
both been comparable in difficulty and classics
of their genre
It was agreed however for the sake of
change that the actual figures should be
changed as identical tests in different years is
just not allowed.
So the Profs went off to their rooms to
locate the papers and make the necessary
alterations.
However, one chap, being slightly more
keen t h a n the other took to phrase 'the
actual figures should be changed' to heart and
concocted a devious plot by which he lowered
the degree of accuracy required and generally
m a n i p u l a t e d many figures; including s u c h
basics as pi so that they all cancelled out the
answer fell out, so to speak.
Naturally his students romped home in the
test and the other Prof, like the gentleman he
was, conceded defeat.
However, two students from the two differ-
ent departments happened to compare their
papers and immediately realized the dastardly
deed one of the Prof's had lowered himself to.
Naturally the students rushed to the Rector,
who has the last word on such matters, but
being the Rector and having the political know-
how to keep all sides happy (and make his own
lot easier) the only comment he offered was
the sardonic 'Obviously the constants were
fixed'.
An Appeal
A n organisation called A C T I V E , which helps
disabled children and adults, has asked us to
help it by suggesting new toys, devices, aids or
whatever for the severely disabled.
U R O P is taking this under its wing and if you
can think up a bright idea U R O P will find a
supervisor to help you develop it.
A C T I V E has funds both to pay for a limited
amount of materials and to support a student
w o r k i n g full-time on his idea d u r i n g the
Summer vacaction.
The difference in A C T I V E ' s approach is that
they a i m to m a k e their e n d - p r o d u c t a
'Worksheet' which gives full instructions for
the disabled person, or someone helping him,
to construct the device themselves. In this way
one-off and special designs can be arrived at to
meet a particular individual's needs.
Thus the work is a double challenge—to
think up the toy or whatever in the first place,
and then to develop it in a form that can be
d u p l i c a t e d by relatively u n s k i l l e d people
working in their homes.
The need is for play, leisure and commun-
ication aids of all kinds—we want your ideas!
