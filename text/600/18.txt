A h well, it's time to be fill erf with Christmas cheer once more and a
terms worth of sport is already over.
A s y o u may notice, there is no results table this week. T h i s is mainly
because the results are mostly well hidden deep in the masses of prose and
are very difficult to find. T o make my task a little easier could all sports
writers please put the score, date played and opposition clearly on the
lop of reports in future.
Some ideas for Christmas presents:
Frank Bogey-Rolla — several injections of penicillin
Phil Niccolls — large tin ol A l k a Seltzer
Ladies H o c k e y — some unbroken sticks and a book "Creative English for
Begginners"

'Twas a grand old match on Wensdy
'gainst Bedford College. Backs were magic
but t' forwards were a load o' Hankers.
In t' first 'all there was no score but T e d
O ' C o n n o r 'urt 'is poor little 'and. J i m m y
from 'owarth (up North) flew through th' air
like an angel, cos' it were 'is last match afore
X m a s .
In t' 2nd ' a l l , after some good pressure
from I . C . , Bedford conceded a penalty a n d
Gary Pike (Gapt.) shouted, 'Shit face!' -
which turned out to be a penalty move a n '
A n d y R a l p h trotted through a weak defence
to score a try. (That reminds me I owe G a r y a
pint!)
B e d f o r d f o u g h t b a c k b u t were n o w t
compared w i ' t' fluent running of th' I . C .
backs and soon W i l l C h a p m a n weaved 'is
way through a sturdy defence to score under
t' posts. What a player! (Bet you can't guess
who wrote this twoddle)
(Love-bite) Winsor converted both tries
and kicked Nick the lly-hall in t h ' 'ead.
N o d d y was just another ex-lirst team winger
and Miles didn't score. T h e final score was a
stupendous 12-0 to I . C .
T e a m : fairly similar to usual 'sept a bit
diffrunl like.

After a fairly stolid season, both the 1st and
2nd teams look set to remain in the 1st and
3rd divisions respectively. T h e 3rds however
(ably supported throughout) look set for
promotion from division 4 to division 3, a n d
therefore presenting 1C with yet another
home derby next term. T h e 4th team is
sticking it out in division 5, and alter settling
down a n d sorting their team out, look set for
greater success in the future.
Last weeks results:
1C1 vs u s e 2-3
1C1 vs Q M C 1 1-4
1C3 vs S t G H 3 5-0
1C4 vs B S O 0-5

The first half of this report consisted of
some Hockey C l u b back biting and I do not
consider that these pages should be used to

A n y w a y , the hilarious points in the match:
the statistical probability of M a r t i n Taylor
actually hitting a 16, C r a i g Cattell's brilliant
save while he was looking the other way to
protect his face from the ball. The goal came
after a dynamic dribble up the pitch by an
unknown report writer and Witter yahooed it
past the goalkeeper from the edge of the D .
T i m S., Eric, Daniel deserve a mention for
their contributions throughout the term.
5-1 brings the terms' results to won 2,

Saturday saw I C 2nds, (severely depleted
after the loss of singing loose head prop J i m
Hutton) faced with the prospect of playing
against 13 players of the team that was
supposed to have played the thirds, with the
other two players nowhere to be seen. As a
result the game generally went IC's way with
tries by W i l l C h a p m a n , M i c k Winsor and a
hattrick from J i m A u s t i n , the third one
c o n v e r t e d w i t h d e v a s t a t i n g a c c u r a c y by
captain Steve Bell, looking for his place in the
1st X V as regular goalkicker perhaps?
Despite some good r u n n i n g , f u l l b a c k
Myles Thompson managed to retain his try
scoring virginity by pulling a hamstring and
falling flat inches from the line, and had to
leave the pitch.
D u r i n g the last 10 minutes play became
verv fluid, with M i c k Winsor making some
dazzling cross-pitch breaks before the referee
ended the game at 24-0.

I C played a fast exciting game throughout,
despite being 2 players short. Full credit to
the team who provided great entertainment
for the spectator a n d captain w h o were
s t a n d i n g o n the side line. T h i s was a n
unexpected win for the thirds, snatching
victory from the jaws of boredom. T o be
quite fair to the opposition, the match was
easy compared with getting into the tube
when Chelsea were playing at home, a n d
that was easily compared with the bar session
later.
