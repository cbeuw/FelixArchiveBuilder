ALBUM REVIEW
The music press is fickle. In 2003,
you couldn’t move for articles prais-
ing French duo M83’s second record,
the gloriously OTT Dead Cities, Red
Seas And Lost Ghosts, using adjec-
tives like ‘superlative’, ‘emotive’,
and (my favourite) ‘transcendent’.
The mixture of cheap-sounding yet
expensive synthesizers and drum
machines, making desolate but
organic-sounding soundscapes,
seemed to defy comparison or
explanation. So, flushed with their
success, our Gallic chums retreated
to their studio to record this, the
follow-up. Unfortunately, the music
press has long since recovered from
its infatuation with their brand of
prog-electro, resulting in a general
half-hearted panning of the album.
So, is it as good as Dead Cities...
is? Yes, but in a different way.
Don’t Save Us From The Flames
is a classic example of punked-up
M83 at work; pleasant female har-
monies drift over furious drums,
underpinned by some thunderous
guitar-as-synth attack. There’s a
distinct eighties feel to the track that
M83 have never exhibited before;
something in the way the synthe-
sisers and guitars overlap. They’ve
also discovered the concept of mas-
sive choruses, as demonstrated by
the wonderfully titled Teen Angst.
Gorgeous arpeggios of keyboards
and stilted, barely understandable
vocals cascade into walls of strings
and utterly enveloping, wordless
vocal harmonies offset against a
cheap, skittering drum machine. I
have absolutely no idea what they’re
singing about, but it’s truly moving.
Asterisk is reminiscent of America
from Dead Cities..., the huge electro
basslines and synthesised strings
now combining with a much more
upfront use of guitars. When you
least expect it, the track drops back
to the menacing bassline, before
lurching back into the main riff.
‘Lurching’ is perhaps the wrong
word, since the most frightening
thing about it is the precision with
which the noise is unleashed.
As with Dead Cities…, at least half
the album is made up of meander-
ing, layered songs that seem to build
and build until there’s little room
to breathe in the sound. Whereas
these would previously drift on for
six minutes plus, most of them clock
in at under four minutes. This new-
found brevity is both a blessing and
a curse; whereas it seemed that the
songs would often run short of ideas
well shy of the end (bar the sublime
Beauties Must Die), now you almost
will them to continue and explore.
A prime example is I Guess I’m
Floating, with its gentle keyboard
progression that cries out to be built
up and built up. Instead, it’s merely
faded out two minutes in.
Car Chase Terror harks back
to M83’s debut with its extensive
use of sampling; crickets and pass-
ing traffic provide a backing for a
truly disturbing roadside dialogue
between a mother and her daughter
about a demonic stalker. As the girl
pleads “Turn the key, go, go!” walls
of synths and double-time drums
create a sense of desperation, of
panic, that aims (and succeeds) to
instil the same fear in the listener.
I’ve mentioned the things that
make this album great, but one song
really defiled my enjoyment of it.
The offender, Can’t Stop, is almost
unredeemable, sounding like a poor
Bee Gees pastiche that destroys the
otherwise perfect first half of the
album. Whatever possessed them to
repeatedly sing, in Chipmunk voic-
es, “I can’t stop, yeah” for more than
two minutes eludes me. Perhaps a
huge dose of LSD is to blame. Thank
your chosen deity for programmable
CD players, eh? I advise you to sim-
ply skip it, and never ever listen to
it. You’ll save yourself the pain of a
single song spoiling this otherwise
great album.

The break-up of The Smiths far behind him, and his partnership with Johnny Marr long
forgotten, Morrissey brings his live show to the stadiums of old England
LIVE REVIEW
The return of Stephen Patrick
Morrissey to the music world from
his self-imposed exile in Los Angeles
was quite possibly the musical high-
light of 2004.
With the release of the album
You Are The Quarry, arguably his
best work since the break up of his
band The Smiths in 1987, Morrissey
took aim at his critics, who “had
my face dragged in fifteen miles of
s***”, and fired with deadly accu-
racy. Depending on your personal
opinion, the enigmatic Mancunian
is often called either ‘the Pope of
mope’ or ‘golden-voice’. On the evi-
dence of his recent material and
this gig at Earl’s Court, I am more
inclined to refer to him by the
latter.
Tonight, ‘golden-voice’ would
have silenced any nay-sayers in the
arena. He opened with the bom-
bastic How Soon Is Now?, a 1984
Smiths classic, sounding as fresh as
the day it was made, with the more
hard-edged Boz Boorer replac-
ing the original swampy sound of
Johnny Marr’s guitar solo. He fol-
lowed this with First Of The Gang
To Die, the story of gang memeber
Hector’s cruel death to ‘a bullet in
his gullet’.
Other highlights included the sin-
gle Let Me Kiss You, and the two clas-
sics from the legendary 1986 album
The Queen Is Dead of Bigmouth
Strikes Again and There Is A Light
That Never Goes Out, where he
sings “If a ten ton truck kills the
both of us, to die by your side, well,
the pleasure and the privilege is
mine.” Morrissey, affectionately
known as Mozzer, can be completely
unlikable and at the same time com-
pellingly charismatic, charming and
malicious in one sentence. Tonight
was no exception.
Many of the later tracks saw
Morrissey in his usual beliger-
ent mood. Soon after lambasting
“lockjawed popstars, thicker than
pig-s***” in The World Is Full Of
Crashing Bores, he takes a shot
at Labour and the Tories in Irish
Blood, English Heart, and at his crit-
ics in You Know I Couldn’t Last. One
aspect of Mozzer’s music is that, if
he isn’t brilliantly laying into one of
his enemies, he pontificates on his
lonely, asexual lifestyle – one that
many of his fans seem to relate to. In
I Have Forgiven Jesus, Moz blames
Christ for giving him “So much love
in a loveless world”.
He finished the night with a Smiths
tear-jerker, Last Night I Dreamt
That Somebody Loved Me, which
pretty well speaks for itself but was
moving mostly because of the beau-
tiful keyboard solo at the end.
Despite the appalling arena, this
gig was sheer adrenaline. Even in
my spot, which seemed so far away I
may as well have been in South Ken,
the band’s electrifying performance
combined with Mozzer’s primal
northern vocals had everyone disap-
pointed that it didn’t go on longer.
A question posed in Morrissey’s
1990 hit Piccadilly Palace was “Why
do you smile when you think about
Earl’s Court?” Following this per-
formance, I had plenty of reasons.
