Oops, he’s done it again. The
world’s most entertaining
royal didn’t so much stick in
a toe as belly-flop into the
waters of controversy again
this week after photos of
Harry dressed as a Nazi were
leaked to The Sun.
The relief on the pages
of the tabloid was palpable.
After weeks of being seri-
ous and worthy while writ-
ing about the tsunami, at last
they had a chance to do what
they do best – write about the
royals and do some serious
mealy- mouthed moralising.
The fact that what Harry
did was indeed extremely
offensive to large numbers of
people round the world (and
it was reported all around the
world) was immaterial – all
The Sun wanted was another
chance to point, laugh, and
throw a few stones.
So the editorial was
superb. “Old soldiers will
be sickened when they see
the young prince behaving
like a drunken member of
the Hitler Youth,” shouted
the paper, suggesting dubi-
ously that “This outfit will
just encourage British neo-
Nazis and racist skinheads to
believe that their sick views
are right”.
Meanwhile, they praised
William’s choice of costume
(a leopardskin leotard with
paws and tail. And they won-
der why this country is going
to the dogs).
The Mirror stooped so
low as to get the waitresses
present to comment on how
‘well-endowed’ William is
and how lovely he looked in
his spangly leotard. Oh, dear
Lord.
The fact that Harry’s great
grandfather Edward VIII was
a Nazi supporter was gleefully
brought up by The Guardian
and The Mail, both of whom
also questioned whether the
princes should have attended
the party, which was held by a
British Olympic showjumper
who also happens to be one
of the people who invaded the
Labour party conference in
support of hunting.
The Telegraph was sym-
pathetic: “We can all agree
that Prince Harry is not very
bright... it would be ludi-
crous to suggest that the
prince was displaying any
sympathy for Hitler when
he wore what looked like the
uniform of Rommel’s Afrika
Korps”.
But the same newspaper
also remarked: “This is not
the stupidity of a 20-year-old,
who has gone through 17
years of the best formal edu-
cation that money can buy.
It is the stupidity of a rather
backward child of 12,” and
castigated Prince Charles for
having insufficient control of
his children. Even William
came in for some bashing –
as the ‘sensible one’, he was
expected to have suggested
to his brother that perhaps
Hitler was not the best fancy
dress role model.
However, just when the fuss
was dying down, the papers
latched onto the fact that
Harry’s blunder could have
cost London its 2012 Olympic
bid. The London bid is large-
ly based around the city’s
status as officially the most
multicultural city on earth;
a member of the royal family
prancing around as a mem-
ber of the SS is not really in-
keeping with that idea.
The Queen’s comments that
she thought the bid would go
to Paris didn’t help either, for
that matter. Until then, the
London bid had been seen
as by far the most dynamic,
and some thought that it was
catching up on the French
favourite. Now, some serious
grovelling is required if the
bid is to get back on track
– the IOC members begin
to visit the five bid cities in
May.

RAG spokesman
RAG is proud to announce
that it has just received a
letter of support from Brian
May, the lead guitarist from
Queen.
Mr May was an undergrad-
uate in the Physics depart-
ment at Imperial College. In
his letter, he recounts his own
experience at Imperial and
the need for students to be
aware of and committed to
worthwhile causes.
Meanwhile, the total has
now reached ‘never before
seen heights outside RAG
Week’ of £3569.38.
On behalf of Imperial RAG,
I would like to ask all of you
to contribute in whatever way
you can. More craziness is
planned for RAG Week.

Mech eng library
safe for now
The mechanical engineer-
ing department’s library and
reading room will not close or
be moved in the immediate
future.
Discussions have taken
place on the possible clo-
sure, as reported in Felix
issue 1310, but the decision
has been deferred “for some
time,” according to Helen
Dawson, the department rep-
resentative.
Ms Dawson said: “There is
the option of making the read-
ing room a faculty room for
the use of engineering stu-
dents in general so that it will
not be lost.”
She offered a note of cau-
tion, warning that “the fight is
not over for good” and pledg-
ing to make sure that stu-
dents are better represented
when similar issues are con-
sidered in the future.
Halal chicken
in College
All freshly prepared chicken
dishes served in the main
Imperial College catering
outlets at South Kensington
will be halal from Monday
onwards. This fact will be
demonstrated to customers
on the menus.
College Catering said they
were pleased to have sourced
halal certified chicken from
their butchers. They also
announced that they were
looking at potential suppliers
with regard to offering halal
beef and other meats in the
future.
