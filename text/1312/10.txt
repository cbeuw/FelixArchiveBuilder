Many are keen to pursue a
career in consulting. Reasons
why include good money, a
jet-setting lifestyle and the
chance to tell MDs how to
run their companies.
Graduates aiming for the
City often choose consult-
ing over banking due to the
project based and problem
solving nature of the work.
A career in consulting is a
lifestyle choice, which gives
the opportunity to work for
many different companies in
a succession of different chal-
lenges. There is the satisfac-
tion of making a difference
and seeing people take over
your ideas and put them into
practice successfully.
Consultants tend to spe-
cialise in one or more areas
that could be divided into four
main types:
‘Generalist’ includes the
large consulting firms offering
a wide range of services from
strategyconsultingandhuman
resources to IT. Examples
of these are Accenture,
Deloitte Consulting, IBM
Business Consulting Services
and Computer Sciences
Corporation.
‘Strategy consulting’ are
the smaller organizations
that offer strategic advice to
companies on a project-by-
project basis. This involves
long range planning, the reor-
ganization of a company’s
structure, rationalization of
services and products, and a
general business appraisal of
the Company. Within this cat-
egory are firms like McKinsey
and Bain.
‘Human resource consult-
ing’ firms offer specialist
advice in personnel policy,
manpower planning, job
enrichment, job evaluation
and industrial relations.
They include Aon Consulting,
Mercer Human Resource
Consulting and Towers
Perrin.
‘Niche firms’ consist of con-
sultants leaving the larger
companies and setting up
their own consultancy firms
in a particular sector, or offer-
ing a specialist service.
In a consulting situation,
there are usually five ‘phases’
to a process: entry (contact-
ing and contracting); diagno-
sis; implementation; consoli-
dation; and evaluation.
Responsibility is a pillar of
a successful consulting proc-
ess, together with empathy
and trust. The client finds
himself in a situation without
the ability to resolve it. When
assignments go wrong, inevi-
tably consultant and client
have a rather different per-
ception of the situation. The
client will usually believe that
the consultant did not come
up with any original ideas and
produced recommendations
which were either impratical
or otherwise unacceptable.
From the consultant’s per-
spective it may look a little
different: the client did not
provide an adequate briefing.
They could never make time
available for meetings but
still wanted everything done
in a hurry.
So, if such a challenging
environment attracts you,
here are some tips:
You will need to display a
wide range of personal quali-
ties. A would-be consultant
must possess the following
traits:
● Integrity – your client’s
needs come first
● An analytical mind – every
problem must have a solution
● Clarity of expression – both
verbally and in writing
● Empathy – the ability to
recognise another person’s
point of view, although not
necessarily agreeing with it.
It is not important to have a
business-related degree and
it is advisable to take sub-
jects that you will enjoy and at
which you will excel, as grades
are the most important factor
to firms. Do as much research
as possible before choosing
a consultancy. Talk to firms
you are interested in and to
people who have worked with
them.
There are several good
sources of information on a
career in consultancy, such
as the MCA (Management
Consultancies Association)
website, www.mca.org.uk,
and the IMC (Institute of
Management Consultancy)
website, www.imc.co.uk.

CAREERS EDITORS
Michael Walton (Imperial
alumnus) set up his own con-
sultancy business. He tells
Felix about his line of work:
How would you define
what consultancy is to
students?
This is difficult, but I would
say that in my industry, a con-
sultant is a person or com-
pany which supplies various
technical services that can-
not be conducted with the cli-
ent’s own resources. These
services are usually related
to projects and have a limited
time span, and a well-defined
‘result’. Alternatively, a con-
sultant is often called in on
an ad-hoc basis as a trouble-
shooter, often in a legal situa-
tion as an expert witness.
After you graduated did
you already know that
you wanted to get into
consultancy?
No, this was never planned,
but being attracted to major
projects, it was the only path
to take in the long term.
Did you have different
jobs in between finishing
your studies and going
into consultancy?
You have to gain a wide range
of experience to have credibil-
ity as a consultant. This can
only be achieved by putting
in the years at various levels
of responsibility in industry.
I worked in production and
technical services before join-
ing a consultancy. I then had
a five year stint as a sales
director importing industrial
consumables, before return-
ing to consulting with my own
business. So that’s 12 years
production/tech, eight years
consulting, five years sales,
and a further eight years on
my own.
Do you think being at
Imperial equipped you
well for your career?
Partly, but when you leave
with your degree, the real
work starts – you basically
only have limited technical
knowledge, and no experi-
ence of industrial practice
and technology in a real
sense – especially IR issues.
Another big issue here is the
interaction of various dis-
ciplines needed in a major
plant, particularly process
and maintenance engineers.
Do you have any advice to
students wishing to get
into this field or advice
resulting from your expe-
riences?
Do not choose consultancy
too young. Spend at least
five years, preferably more,
before considering this, as it
is easy to be pigeon-holed.
The best way to get into this
is with a large engineering
consultant such as Bechtel
or KBR. This allows a wide
range of experience quite
quickly.
Any additional informa-
tion or thoughts?
I would hesitate to recom-
mend starting out by oneself
too young, it is not easy – I
am over 50! Some commer-
cial experience is also needed
to avoid financial pitfalls. A
business course would be
very useful.
