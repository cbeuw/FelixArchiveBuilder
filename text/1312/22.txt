Odd ones out
Okay, turn off Google and put down
The Guiness Book of Hit Singles
– cheating is for tossers.
Right, now that that’s out of the
way...
The music section of pub quizzes
is always a favourite, but a little dif-
ficult to translate to the page. Plus,
you lot cheat and just whack it in
Google or whatever. So, to make it
hard, you just get one line this time,
specifically the first one. Here’s a
bunch of famous opening song lines,
you just have to tell us the name of
the song and who sang it.
The difficulty ranges from piece-
of-piss to taking-the-piss, so don’t
worry if you don’t know all the
answers. Some of these songs are
new, some are old, some are good,
and there’s some crap there too.
We’ve tried to include some stuff
from most genres, so it’s not all
indie shoe-gazing. Just try! That’s
unusually optomistic for us...
1. “Very superstitous, writing’s on
the wall”
2. “We’re caught in a trap”
3. “America... America... America,
fuck yeah!”
4. “You will, you won’t”
5. “I see a red door and I want it
painted black”
6. “She was more like a beauty
queen from a movie scene”
7. “Oh, my love, my darling”
8. “I was dreaming while I wrote
this, forgive me if it goes astray”
9. “The race is on to get out of the
bottom, the top is high so your roots
are forgotten”
10. “Ah, look at all the lonely peo-
ple”
11. “Dirty old river, must you keep
rolling”
12. “Riding along in my automo-
bile”
13. “I’ve got sunshine, on a cloudy
day”
14. “I tried to discover, a little
something to make me sweeter”
15. “It’s a god-awful small affair to
the girl with the mousy hair”
16. “I made it through the wilder-
ness”
17. “You know I – thug ‘em, fuck
‘em, love ‘em, leave ‘em”
18. “Under blue moon I saw you, so
soon you’ll take me”
19. “Well you’re dirty and sweet,
clad in black, don’t look back, and I
love you”
20. “I would like to leave this city,
this old town don’t smell to pretty”
21. “The change will do you good, I
always knew it would”
22. “There’s a lady who’s sure all
that glitters is gold”
23. “All you people look at me like
I’m a little girl”
24. “You spurn my natural emo-
tions, you make me feel like dirt”
25. “I wanna take a walk, rain
cloud, coat on”
26. “Shyness is nice, and shyness
can stop you”
27. “Jumped in the river, and what
did I see?”
28. “So I look in your direction”
29. “When routine bites hard and
ambitions are low”
30. “In the deserts of Sudan”

This is a test of all-round general
knowledge, or guessing, as we like
to call it.
We’ve given you eight sets of
things, and in each set there’s one
out one out. You just have to tell us
which. If you don’t know, just guess!
1. Metal Lyrics
Crappy Death Metal music, as well
as being loud and annoying, is also
famous for it’s over-elaborate lyri-
cal wordplay. Here are four sets of
lyrics, only one of which we’ve made
up. Tell us which one.
A. ‘When suddenly there shone a
hideous light and a voice like three
insanities soared up in thistled
speech’
B. ‘Oh, blackened dusk, eyes burn-
ing; abandon me, forsaken one’
C. ‘This morning when I awoke
from the cushioned calls, eyes pour-
ing their little hearts’
D. ‘Pulling out the poisoned fangs,
the venom never goes away’
2. B-Movies
There are some god-awful films
around these days, but then again,
it’s always been like this. The titles
years ago were way more amusing.
Here’s four B-Movie gems for you,
one of which we made up.
A. Boogie Jungle
B. Frankenhooker
C. Stop it, you’re killing me!
D. Cat-women of the Moon
3. TV Superstars
Apologies if you didn’t grow up
watching early nineties kids’ TV
shows on a Saturday morning, you’re
just going to have to guess this one.
These are absolute legends of TV.
A. Roy Castle – trumpet virtuoso,
Record Breaker, and all round good
egg. Sadly no longer with us.
B. Neil Buchanon – “This is an art
attack! This is an art attack! This
is Art Attack!” Awesome. Also did
my fave programme ever, Finders
Keepers.
C. Keith Chegwin – a man who
would do seemingly anything for
his ‘art’. Once presented the most
disturbing programme ever shown
on British TV, Naked Jungle, star-
ring his knob.
D. Les Dawson – a legend of the
comedy circuit, it’s a little known
fact the Les began his career on
kids’ TV show Dawson and the
Donkeys.
4. Pointless Research
Millions of pounds are wasted every
year at institutes across the world,
finding the answers to questions
that nobody really cares about.
Of course, that never happens at
Imperial. One of these has been
made up.
A. If a tree falls in the forest, does
it make a sound?
B. What is the formula for the
most scary film possible?
C. Why does toast always land the
wrong way around?
D. When exactly is the
Millennium?
5. Baby Names
A name is for life, not just for birth-
days, but some parents don’t seem
to realise this and give their kids
ridiculous monikers that they’ll just
grow up to hate. Only one of these
didn’t make the top fifty most popu-
lar baby names in 2003.
A. Archie B. Tyler
C. Kurt D. Poppy
6. Way To Go
Live fast, die young, leave a beauti-
ful corpse. It seems a great motto
to live by, unless you happen to die
wanking tied to a door, or some-
thing. That’s not so cool. The follow-
ing are all genuine causes of death,
apart from one, which is just a lie.
Or at least we hope it is, you never
know.
A. Attacked by swan
B. Fell off a building in a spitting
contest
C. Took out the engine of a truck
whilst lying below
D. Ran over by commercial air-
liner
7. Opening lines
The last book I read was James and
the Giant Peach, so I’m not exactly
a literary expert. I’ve heard, though,
that not all books are as well-writ-
ten or exciting as James’ whimsi-
cal journey with some overgrown
insects. Some are as badly written
as this page. Here are four opening
lines, all awful, but one has been
made up.
A. ‘Why do nuts women always
have cats?’
B. ‘She popped the elastic at the
top of her second sock and pushed
her sexually ambigous Timed watch
up along the blonde hair of her hand-
some forearms’
C. ‘She stuck to his prime grade
A tush like shrink wrap to a rump
roast’
D. ‘As the years had gone on, his
elderly neighbour had become to
look more attractive’
8. Wrestling Giants
Wrestling, truly the sport of kings.
bizarre outfits, strange ‘special’
moves and weird names, this homo-
erotic display of obesity has shaped
many people’s opinion of what a true
man is. One of these ‘wrestlers’ isn’t
real. Unlike the sport, which is.
A. Giant Haystacks
B. Brutus ‘The Barber’ Beefcake
C. Andre The Giant
D. Phil ‘The Power’ Taylor
