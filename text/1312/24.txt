Warwick Bears
Indoor Tournament
By Ian Ballantyne
The Disc Doctors, Imperial
College’s Ultimate Frisbee
team, met at Euston Station
to catch the 19.40 train to
Coventry for a wild weekend
at the Warwick Bears Fun
Indoors Tournament.
At 19.35, the Disc Doctors
(DD) guys were a little wor-
ried that George still wasn’t
there. So, reluctantly, they
made their way to the Virgin
train. With 30 seconds left
until departure, a rather calm
George had hopped on and
started walking down the car-
riage. His estimate of getting
across London in 40 minutes
on a Friday at rush hour was
a little unrealistic!
Finally at the destination
on the Warwick campus,
DD headed straight for “the
bar”. No really, that was the
name! At least there was no
confusion as to what kind
of things happened on the
premises. DD took a trip to
the union where they ripped
up the dance floor, showing
the Warwick students how to
dance, Doctors style! After
an hour or so of dancing and
drinks, the guys left to sleep
on a kitchen floor. Luxury!
Waking up only about four
hours later, DD headed over
to the sports hall, there of
course to run around and play
some indoor Ultimate!
Angels 7
Disc Doctors 1
Angels were a team from
Brixton, London, yet we
ended up travelling 100 miles
from home in order to play
them!
The fellow Londoners, who
were seeded second in group
C, set the day’s standard
by throwing a zone. It only
took a single mistake from
DD for Angels to capitalise
and score. A change of tactics
broke up the zone, allowing
Stas to score the first point
for Disc Doctors.
Although DD were 5–1
down, they didn’t give up
the fight and kept up a great
deal of pressure during the
7th Angels’ point. The point
lasted for a long time, wear-
ing down both teams and
causing Angels to throw away
a lot of discs.
This was a tough first game,
as was apparent from the
large number of people stag-
gering off the pitch at the
end.
Disc Doctors 3
Bears 3 2
The next game was against
Bears Thirds. Home support
can become a little over-
whelming, but DD kept their
cool, gaining many of the
turnovers by forcing Bears to
make mistakes.
It didn’t take the home side
long to get their rhythm back,
scoring two points against
DD. But Imperial turned the
scoring around quicker than
George W could rig the US
election.
The pace picked up with
all the players having to run
hard to keep up with their
marks. Doctors scored a point
and Munky caught two great
passes from Stylish, both of
which were outside of the
blue lines! It really didn’t help
that the sidelines blended in
quite nicely with the blue col-
our of the sports hall floor.
Determined not to step
out for the third time in a
row, Munky stood in the end-
zone, reaching out to score
DD’s second. The tight
score elevated tension, and
the shouting on pitch was
immense, but this didn’t stop
the Doctors increasing their
score to three points. With
the seconds disappearing like
an open packet of crisps in
the pub, Finnish and Stylish
thwarted the Bears’ last-
ditch overhead attempt. Disc
Doctors had won the game,
and a very close one at that!
Red 11
Disc Doctors 2
Even before DD were on the
pitch, the Red team looked
very experienced, a charac-
teristic that was only empha-
sised by their third place
seeding.
On the pitch, they were bet-
ter than on paper, making
scoring look like child’s play.
The determined Disc Doctors
picked up the pace, pushing
to subdue the Red guys who
were always one step ahead.
Just when it looked as
though one of Red’s better
positioned players would
get Stylish’s overhead, Stas
reached that tiny bit further,
beating his mark to score
DD’s first point.
Inthelastminute,observers
watched as three overhead
attempts were intercepted by
players, one of which involved
Stylish admirably prising the
disc out of the air, sandwiched
between two Red players.
Both teams had a fantas-
tic game, which fortunately
ended in time for everyone
to head over to “the bar” to
watch the football!
Whiplash 12
Disc Doctors 2
It was apparent from the
previous game that the Disc
Doctors didn’t have a fool-
proof plan to eliminate cheeky
overhead passes and, as Red
had picked up on this, so did
Whiplash.
They sent direct passes to
their players in the corners
of the endzone, who caught
them with minimal fuss. As
Whiplash went ahead, Disc
Doctors struggled with
organisation, allowing a few
silly points to be scored. The
lack of good cuts from DD
players made it a little hard
for the DD handlers, but the
guys still managed to score
two points.
The game ended with Disc
Doctors in need of medical
treatment caused by a good
whipping! Nevertheless it
was worth playing the team.
Airwolf 9
Disc Doctors 5
The crossover game of the
day, which could have pulled
DD out of the bottom group,
was against the Ironman
team (a team without substi-
tutes), Airwolf.
Unfortunately, DD were on
a bit of a low from the last two
games, but as the Ironmen
got worn down, DD got more
enthusiastic as more and
more chances came their
way. Play was aggressive but
safe and even included the
odd ambitious throw.
As DD came back, Stylish
threw an overhead pass with
tensecondsontheclock,which
was magnificently caught by
Matt right in the corner of the
endzone. Although they had
been beaten, DD were still
pleased with their monster
comeback. Hats off to Airwolf,
who looked truly knackered!
The Party
As the games finished, the
whole team began to focus
on party aspect of the tour-
nament. Being a fun tourna-
ment, everyone could let loose
and party to the early hours!
The guys went for plenty of
food and drink to make up
for the energy exerted during
the day.
It was Boogie Nights at the
union, with the DJ spinning
up some classic disco/funk
for the masses. The place
was buzzing with more peo-
ple than a night at LSE on a
Friday, but due to the tremen-
dous size of the union there
was loads of space to sit and
chill.
In ultimate style, Stas and
