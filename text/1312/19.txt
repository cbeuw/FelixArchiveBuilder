The new film version of the clas-
sic novel by William Makepeace
Thackeray centres on Rebecca
(Becky) Sharp, a shrewd woman
who rose through the ranks of
British society by playing men at
their own game.
Born into poverty and orphaned
at a young age, Becky (Reese
Witherspoon) resolves to infiltrate
English society and fulfil dreams of
glamorous gowns and posh dinner-
dos. Becky can rely only on her wit,
guile and sexuality as she makes
her way up through London soci-
ety. She leaves school with her best
friend Amelia – a stupidly optimis-
tic creature who was Thackeray’s
parody of good-girl heroines – and
finds employment as governess to
the daughters of Sir Pitt Crawley
whilst befriending Crawley’s mon-
eybag dowager aunt Matilda, who
eventually invites her to London.
Matilda is outraged when Becky
secretly marries her favourite and
rather dashing nephew Rawdon
– a soldier, a gambler, and as good
a match for Becky as can be imag-
ined. Naturally, she treats him like
dirt. Aunt Matilda cuts off all social
and financial ties with the newly-
weds, forcing them to find other
ways of financing Becky’s needs.
This starts off with gambling to pay
off the somewhat persistent bailiffs
but eventually leads to Becky getting
involved with a rather slimy Steyne
(Gabriel Byrne), whose assistance
comes at a higher cost than she
anticipated.
If you haven’t read Thackeray’s
Vanity Fair, and let’s be honest,
most people here haven’t (includ-
ing me), Mira Nair’s new film ver-
sion will probably pass as a reason-
able approximation with a pleasant
enough ending.
However, there is a problem:
Thackeray wasn’t interested in
being pleasant. “I want to leave eve-
rybody dissatisfied and unhappy at
the end of the story,” he once said
about his cynical bestseller.
What the book has is a great anti-
heroine: Becky Sharp, the amoral,
two-faced social butterfly who climbs
the ladder until she gets the money
and position she craves. It’s a great
part for Reese Witherspoon, who
proved she could play a soulless and
mesmerizing female as Tracy Flick,
the conniving high school student of
1999’s Election. She was chillingly
conniving in that film. If Witherspoon
had tapped into Flick’s ruthlessness
we might have had something here.
It’s a huge disappointment, then,
that Witherspoon and the director
have neutered Becky Sharp. Becky
has been changed into a shrewd,
somewhat misguided, essentially
sympathetic heroine. She has been
made lovable -- and a Vanity Fair
with a lovable Becky Sharp has no
reason to exist.
Witherspoon gets the accent and
the bearing reasonably right, but
everything else is missing. Don’t
get me wrong here – I don’t think
this is her fault, she’s actually very
good but it’s difficult to condense
a 900 page book into a two hour
film. All the attention seems to have
been lavished on the lush settings
and perfect costumes, while details
of character and plot development
seem to have been overlooked.
Byrne (the slimeball) is particu-
larly impressive, as is Eileen Atkins
as Aunt Matilda, who must have
had the best one liners of the whole
film. Although James Purefoy gives
a good account of Becky’s dreamy
husband, the other suitors are less
impressive. Rhys Ifans’ well-mean-
ing Dobbin gets stranded with a
dreadful line towards the end of the
film after he decides to return from
his trip to India. I can’t really explain
it but it is so shockingly bad that it’s
very funny.
While Nair can’t be accused of
delivering a conventional corset
drama, fans of the novel will feel
the film is a rather cheap apprecia-
tion of Thackeray’s tale, particularly
given the skilful way she handled
the human complexities in her pre-
vious film, Monsoon Wedding. Nair
glosses over the intricacies of the
story with sumptuous visual flour-
ishes that might be expected after
watching her last film, which was
truly gorgeous.
The result is a social satire without
any bite, but don’t let that put you
off. It’s still worth seeing for the one
liners, the visuals and the extremely
dashing Rawdon Crawley.

Preview: Elektra
Released: 21 January
From the pages of Marvel Comics,
creators of X-Men and Spiderman,
comes Elektra.
Shrouded in mystery. Tainted by
tragedy. Trained to kill. Then left
for dead. But for Elektra (Jennifer
Garner), death was just the begin-
ning. Now she’s back, with a venge-
ance.
Tourtured by her past and haunt-
ed by her own mysterious death,
Elektra finds herself resurrected.
Although her sensei has trained
her well in the strict discipline of
ninjutsu, he cannot begin to tame
her burning rage over the brutal
murder of her parents. Elektra’s
need to avenge this untenable crime
forces her into exile. She becomes
an assassin – the best in the
business. But for a woman like
Elektra, killing is no way to make
a living.
To save herself, Elektra needs
something more than a reason to
kill; she needs a reason to live. She
finds it in the form of her latest
target Abby (Kirsten Prout), a feisty
13-year-old in whom Elektra sees so
much of herself, and Abby’s father,
Mark (Goran Visnjic). In her despa-
rate struggle to save them, Elektra
finds something she did not even
know she was looking for: redemp-
tion.
Along the way, Elektra encounters
an army of assailants with deadly
supernatural powers, from an assas-
sin bearing tattoos with a life of their
own to a disease-spreading demon.
Her only allies are her combat skills,
her sai and a limited ability to see
the future.
Directed by Rob Bowman (The X
Files, Reign of Fire) and influenced
by Asian-flavoured cinema, Elektra
has spectacular stunts, elektra-fying
martial arts sequences and one of
Hollwood’s most appealing actress-
es taking centre stage as the beauti-
ful and deadly assassin.
Elektra is poised to be a killer at
the box office this year. Alan Ng
