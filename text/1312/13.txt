ALBUM REVIEWS
Now I don’t think Feeder have ever
been cool, but the nature of cool is
so fickle that I am going to ignore it
while listening to this album. In fact ,
I am ignoring coolness so much I am
wearing ankle warmers (so last sea-
son) and smoking crack (so 2001).
Anyway, back to the task in hand.
Everyone should be aware of
Feeder’s situation: their last album
Comfort In Sound was released in
the wake of drummer Jon Lee’s
apparent suicide. The tragedy was
obviously hanging over the album
as it was released quite soon after
the event. Reviewers didn’t want to
slag the album off in case they were
accused of manslaughter or arrested
for being big meanies. This obvious-
ly hid the fact that their last album
was rather bland. So I bet reviewers
are frothing at the mouth to rip into
this exploration of the banal known
as Pushing The Senses.
I genuinely wanted to like this
album because I am anticipating
the bad reviews. However, as the CD
ended, I sighed in despair.
It is, for all intents and purposes,
Comfort In Sound 2, except without
the stadium rockers. What we are
left with is a mellow mess of emo-
tions and clichéd lyrics. The closest
we get to something that remotely
rocks is the title track or Pilgrim
Soul, which is anthemic rather than
rocking. Having said that, it still feels
like an overproduced Insomnia from
their earlier days, with added hand-
claps (though not even the power of
the handclap can save this song).
Which leads me to the production;
Gil Norton, the producer of Comfort
In Sound, returns behind the desk.
This time, he’s ready to insert some
‘electronica’ into the mix to make
you think their sound has advanced
even if the songwriting hasn’t. It adds
an overproduced sheen where there
are no new ideas, just the same idea
fattened up. When Norton produced
The Pixies, the sound went from
the still raw Surfer Rosa sound to
the more palatable Doolittle sound,
but Franck Black and Kim Deal’s
songwriting still retained vitality.
Grant Nicholas’ writing does have
underlying uplifting themes such as
the celebration theme in Dove Grey
Sands but they aren’t communicat-
ed effectively enough to take you
anywhere.
Burn Pilgrim Soul off this album
as it is Feeder at their best, driving
with a typical sing-along chorus. The
ponderous lethargic nature of this
album is never engaging or uplift-
ing as it intends to be with its bright
colour scheme (suspiciously looking
like the Winning Days by the Vines
album cover, another unengaging
follow-up).
The singing and songwriting
fight hard to find a message and a
melody to convey it with, but it all
ends up feeling laboured. It appears
that their energy has evaporated
and they need a week of electric
shock therapy whilst on Pro-Plus.
Take, for example, their first single,
Tumble And Fall: it’s not a piece
of Anthemology 101 but a plodding
string-laden moan-athon. Not a good
sign of things to come.

A tricky one this. You see, in my
opinion, there is no need for this
album to exist. The Others have
always been more about their live
shows; I saw them at Glastonbury
and the dedication that was shown
by a large chunk of the crowd was
impressive, fans who have followed
them all the way. And in return,
front man Dominic Masters was
down there with them, putting his
heart on the greasy sleeve of his
charity-shop suit jacket.
The fans are obviously very impor-
tant to the band. In the past it was
common practice to have their
entire fan club on the guest list
for shows, so those who couldn’t
afford to could go, could. They get an
album dedication: Community 853
is named after them.
After their dedicated fan base The
Others are probably best known
for their “guerrilla gigging”, play-
ing with minimal announcement
in unconventional places, namely
a Hammersmith & City tube, the
foyer of Radio 1, and probably your
bedroom if you asked them. These
are the important things about The
Others, their semi-mythology.
So, on to the music. It starts really
promisingly, with Lackey, upbeat
new-wave drums and bass, with
razor-sharp guitars similar to Slow
Hands by Interpol. But in gener-
al you get your Libertines-esque
urchin-rock standard backing. It’s
only a matter of time before Pete
Doherty starts selling backing tapes
like this to fuel his crack addiction.
A strange bunch as well. The bass
player’s an ageing goth, the guitarist
is a skinhead called something like
Johnny Lager, and... well I couldn’t
tell you anything remarkable about
the drummer, even under threat of
being force-fed the millions of copies
of Busted’s third album they’ll never
release (Busted RIP).
OK then, what’s the point? Why do
they have a fan base at all? Enter Mr
Masters, his skinny frame and lank
hair railing against all authority. He
doesn’t sing, oh-no, ‘cos that’s what
the record company wants him to
do. Instead he executes a lazy drawl
that turns “out of here” to “ou-ha-
ere”, or the track Pshychovision to
“psah-cow-vee-shown”. It came as
no surprise that the favourite gig
he’s been to is an Oasis concert.
Occasional bursts of “chicka-chicka-
chick-ow!” had me grinning, and
I’m sure “ba-ba-ba-ba-ba…bow!”
had McFly’s lawyers reaching for
the phone. Right, so he’s no Jeff
Buckley, what else could they have
going for them?
Lyrics? Well... kinda. You can see
how the lyrics in debut release This
Is For The Poor could affect some
people: “this is for all the kids who
stand out in the crowd, for all the
one’s who’ve been shoved around,
this is for every disappointment.”
So is he some new-age poet, speak-
ing for the “kids”, eyes open to the
plights of the poor? No. Masters
really has very little to say. “I want
ya to myself, I need ya more than
anyone else” from Southern Glow
…yawn. “Don’t wanna sell my soul
to the man today” from Lackey
…ooh not the demonic “man” who
pays your wages (or rather doesn’t,
you cheeky little job-dodger).
Lines like “I did acid before I did
hash, I never wanted to sell my
ass” had me pissing myself laugh-
ing, but when in the otherwise taut
and brooding Almanac he moans
“I came to London when I was 18, I
had no money it was only a dream”
my iPod almost got defenestrated. I
mean, boo-de-fucking-hoo.
Somusicallyboring,vocallyboring,
lyrically boring. “This is for the poor,
not the rich kids,” rails Masters. It
seems the “rich kids” have bought
themselves the right not to listen to
a substandard Libertines support
band. One last thing, please don’t
give my address out to any of their
fans, I feel they may be less than
understanding...
James Millen
Digweed is one of the forefathers
of the modern dance scene. He’s
been successful all around the
world for over a decade, created
what some call the first DJ mix CD,
Renaissance, with Sasha (which has
recently been remastered), and he’s
even got his own show on Kiss.
The Fabric/Fabriclive series of
mix CDs is now up to number 20,
with each mix giving a subtly dif-
ferent slice of the broad genre we
call dance music. The smart ones
amongst you will have subscribed
to the series and received a new
mix every month for the rather good
price of £6.
So here’s number 20, and given
the prowess of the DJ and the qual-
ity of the series so far, we’re all
expecting it to be pure gold. The mix
starts gently, easing us in with soft
rhythmic elements and a mellow
vocal sample. The sounds develop to
fill more and more of the sonic can-
vas until a solid drum beat finally
appears after five minutes or so.
Moving smoothly into track two,
with the pulse of the music building,
then into another within a few min-
utes, the music drops into a break-
down with a simple but effective
vocal, and when the beat comes
back you realise how deep into the
mix you already are. Track four, DJ
Rasoul’s True Science, picks up the
pace further, with a foreboding bass
riff then a some funky sax over the
top to keep things moving.
The next track (The Glass’ Won’t
Bother Me) is similarly bass-led but
with a more developed, funky house
style riff. The next track is Billy
Dalessandro’s In The Dark, which
is dark and tribal. At the end of this
one, Digweed skillfully brings up
the chunky overdriven bass of track
eight, Venom by Bobby Peru. This
track progresses with bleepy and
metallic sounds going all over the
place, until towards the end a much
more solid beat comes in to tighten
things up a bit.
Moving into the next track, Martin
Solveig’s Rocking Music, the sound
gets more serious and driven for
a few minutes, before the bassline
from Slam’s Lie To Me washes up
and releases the pressure – the kind
of bassline that destroys a dance-
floor. A few minutes of this and
the mix moves on, into the robotic
whining of Angel Alanis’ Knob Job.
Again the bassline moves things on,
resolving the tension built from the
previous mix.
Next up is Josh Wink’s mix of
Infusion’s Better World, with a sam-
ple of “The beat don’t stop” intro-
ducing the track before it unleashes
yet more killer bass. I’ve been hear-
ing this track out and about all over
the place, and it really hits the spot.
This is the ‘peak’ of the mix, which
would be at around 3-4am in a club.
After this track is Superpitcher’s
Happiness (“I want happiness/I
seek happiness”), which keeps
things moving, but towards the end
has a good minute which is just a
synth noise being wound up and
down, before it finally becomes a riff
and the actual music returns. This
kind of think is usually OK on the
dancefloor, but as one of my friends
put it, “What are we supposed to
do now?” Next is Emico by Joel
Mull, a beautiful slice of prog, sur-
rounded by emotive strings, and the
mix is finished with the strung out
pseudo vocals of Matrix and Danny
J’s Vertigo.
Diggers has done it again, and
brought us what most would
describe as a virtually perfect set.
This has blissful beats that’ll keep
you warm until the summer comes.
Get it.
