CLUB REVIEW
414. Every hardcore hard dance fan
in the city should know these three
digits. For those that don’t, the 414
is an absolute gem of a club – situ-
ated at number 414 Coldharbour
Lane, Brixton, for over a decade
it’s been supplying the nocturnal
hordes with just what they want
– pumping, pounding, bouncy music,
all weekend.
The place is tiny, holding a couple
of hundred at the most, and con-
sists of downstairs, with bar and
the dancefloor, and upstairs (via a
narrow, twisty iron staircase) which
serves as a chillout area. There’s no
music upstairs – the relentless thud-
ding of the music from beneath is
plenty. There are, however, a snack
bar serving teas, coffees, pot noo-
dles and the like, a projector screen,
a fish tank, and giant Connect 4.
The music policy is simple – hard.
Hard house, hard trance, and ‘Nu-
NRG’ are some of the names for this
kind of sound. Solid four-to-the-floor
beats at a giddy speed, plus more
drones, horns and hoover sounds
than you can shake a glow stick at.
The place is open for the majority
of the weekend: Friday, Saturday
and Sunday from 10pm to 6am, and
afterparties on Saturday and Sunday
from 6.30am until 2pm. Come here
any time and you will find more
or less the same thing – banging
tunes, and a wild and eclectic crowd
of revellers to bounce alongside or
chat to.
With all this in mind and after an
uneventful weekend, plus the added
bonus of no lectures on Monday, I
went down to check out Just Groove,
414’s regular Sunday night party.
The first question that might
spring to mind is: who the hell goes
to a hard house club on a Sunday
night? Well, me for a start. The rest
of the crowd is made up of those
looking for somewhere to stomp out
the dying hours of their all-weekend
session, and, well, randoms. There
is always a nice mixture of people
– I had a nice chat to a Greek guy in
his fifties (wearing a tweed jacket)
who’s been coming here since it
opened.
“So you like hard house then?” I
asked, half rhetorically. The grin and
definite nod said it all. Later I saw
this chap bouncing around the club,
giving it just as much oomph as
anyone else. My point’s not that this
guy stuck out, quite the opposite. In
clubs like this, anything goes and
all are welcome, especially in some-
where this cosy. The only thing peo-
ple would object to is pretension, if
there was any. Instead, the attitude
here is spot on – give it some on the
dance floor, or hang about upstairs
and have a cup of tea, a chat, and a
couple of rounds of giant Connect 4.
On the floor was where I spent
most of the night, enjoying the won-
derful sounds of DJs Skol, Muzz
and Roosta. These guys have been
residents here for at least as long
as I’ve been coming, which in itself
speaks volumes. To be consistently
delivering the goods to the beat-
hungry whilst helping the club go
from strength to strength year after
year, these guys are most definitely
doing a lot of things right. As the
night rolled on, so the music intensi-
fied. Needless to say I couldn’t move
my body fast enough, with the music
pushing me on with electric, acid-
tinged sounds and breakdowns that
build with a million snares until they
peak, offering a moment’s respite for
the crowd before the beat returns to
hammer them some more.
A couple of the tracks I can pick
out were a super-energised mix of
Members of Mayday’s happy house
anthem 10 in 01 and a remix of
Pure White’s classic hardcore track
4am (which itself sampled Beverly
Craven’s Promise Me).
The club was by no means full
tonight, but that didn’t matter. The
place is so small that it never feels
empty, and with only 50 or 60 people
there you will see, if not speak to
most of them, and everyone here is
genuine and friendly. The bar staff
are cute and fun, too. I did leave with
a bit of ringing in my ears, so next
time I’ll remember my ear plugs.
Over all the time I’ve been com-
ing here, the 414 has changed a
bit, but it’s still got all of its charm
and character. Upstairs used to be
bare, cold and dirty – now there’s
a carpet, the windows are properly
blocked and there are some nice
fairy lights to complement the UV
murals. The spiral staircase itself
is decorated with more fairy lights,
and around the dance floor there’s
more UV-active decoration. The vibe
remains.
So, if you’re ever looking for some-
thing a bit harder, or if you’ve been
out and don’t want to go home, I’d
recommend you pay a visit. If you
can make it for Just Groove it’s well
worth it for the novelty of clubbing
on a Sunday alone – it’s a great way
to start your week.
