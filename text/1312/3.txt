Currency galore
Keeping to the theme of the US economy, Numaan Chaudhry takes a deeper
look at the dodgy dollar and strong sterling
Having fallen 16% against a
basket of its trading partners’
currencies over the past three
years, the US dollar should, in
theory, make US-made goods
more competitive with those
made abroad, boosting US
growth and employment.
But a growing number of
experts warn that the US’s
gaping budget and trade
deficits will lead to a crisis
in which a sharp decline in
the dollar drives up interest
rates sharply, squeezing the
economy.
There are plenty of trou-
bling examples. Over the
past decade, a dozen small-
er economies from Mexico
to Thailand have gone from
growth to deep recession
when their currencies col-
lapsed. Even rich countries
like Canada have been forced
to adopt ascetic budget poli-
cies to cope with currency-
induced turmoil. “We are
increasingly vulnerable to the
kind of sudden stop, where
the capital inflows dry up all
at once, that’s been the bane
of emerging markets over
the years,” says an economic
historian at the University of
California.
Could it happen in the US?
A review of past crises sug-
gests the US has enough
going for it now to avoid a
similar fate. Yet the scale of
the imbalances now hanging
over the dollar are also with-
out precedent, suggesting a
crisis is still a possibility.
The contrasts with the most
recent dollar crisis, in the late
1970s, are both encouraging
and unsettling.
Between September 1977
and October 1978, the dollar
fell 16% against major cur-
rencies, aided downwards
by rising oil prices and slug-
gish economic growth that
pushed the US from a trade
surplus to a trade deficit. The
weaker dollar helped boost
the price of imports, and infla-
tion jumped to over 8.2% from
6.5%.
Worried that the falling dol-
lar might undermine its anti-
inflation efforts, the Carter
administration announced a
‘multipart support package’
in 1978: the Treasury would
use sales of gold, foreign bor-
rowing and the International
Monetary Fund to defend the
dollar. At the same time, the
Fed would raise its discount
rate 1%.
The dollar stabilized but
still remained weak, and
inflation continued the rise
up to 10% by June 1979. In
the summer of 1979, Paul
Volcker was appointed, from
his previous position of presi-
dent of the New York Federal
Reserve Bank, as Fed chair-
man. Volcker concluded that
dramatic action was needed
to break the crippling infla-
tion rates.
On 6 October, the Fed
adopted a new monetary
policy for strangling inflation
by targeting growth in the
money supply, knowing that
it would send interest rates
soaring. Volcker’s new strat-
egy worked; inflation was
smothered and this eventu-
ally bolstered the dollar, but
the price was high: the deep-
est recession since the Great
Depression.
As it stands, the US has
proven its strength in the glo-
bal economy by maintaining
a ‘twin deficit’, both a large
current account and budget
deficit. The average emerg-
ing economy would have
already gone belly-up with
these twin deficits, but the
US has been spared because
it can still borrow in dollars
instead of foreign currency,
meaning others bear the pain
if the dollar depreciates.
By contrast, developing
countries often borrowed in
dollars to take advantage of
lower interest rates, but faced
a crushing repayment burden
when they could no longer
keep their currency pegged
to the dollar.
Even rich countries, howev-
er, have been rocked by a run
on their currencies. It hap-
pened to Britain in the 1970s.
Several times in the early
1990s, Canada’s dollar came
under pressure because of
big twin deficits.
The central bank raised
interest rates in response,
but that worsened the
budget deficit by adding to
interest on the public debt.
When Standard & Poor’s, the
respected credit ratings agen-
cy, reduced the credit rating
on Canada’s foreign currency
debt, Canadians thought they
would default.
The US today has an eerie
similarity with Canada of ten
years ago, since both current
account and budget deficits
are about the same size rela-
tive to GDP
, at 5%.
However, the US has an
additional advantage over any
other country when it comes
to crisis prevention: its econ-
omy is simply too large and
too important for the world
economy to passively accept
a dollar collapse.
That is one reason many
countries prop up the dol-
lar. China runs a massive
trade surplus with the US,
something that would nor-
mally force the yuan, the
US-pegged currency, to rise
against the dollar. To prevent
that, China buys billions of
dollars in Treasury securities.
That protects its exports and
helps keep US interest rates
low.
It has been a decade since
the dollar’s drop seemed
dangerous enough to spark
a firm response from the US
and its allies.
In early 1995, there were
reports of massive dollar
sales, some triggered by
derivatives strategies, driving
it down sharply against the
German mark and Chinese
yen. Bond yields were also
rising and this required inter-
vention from the US Federal
Reserve: Alan Greenspan
waded in and bought $600 mil-
lion of marks and yen.
The next day it repeated the
action, joined by 13 central
banks. The dollar stabilized
and bond yields dropped.
Fosters to bid for
Southcorp
Other business news this
week: Fosters Group Ltd is
to become one of the world’s
biggest winemakers by buy-
ing out Southcorp in a hostile
$3.1 billion offer.
Already owning 18.8% of
Southcorp’s shares, Foster’s
said it will bid $4.17 a share
for the remaining 81.2% of
Southcorp and assume about
$500 million of Southcorp
debt.
As was the case with M&S
and GoldFields earlier this
year, and indeed in many pre-
vious hostile takeovers, the
bid from Fosters is “inad-
equate and opportunistic,”
according to Southcorp.
Shares in Southcorp, last
quoted at $4.25, surged ear-
lier this week after the take-
over bid was announced. A
two-year high of $4.76 was
reached before the closing
price at $4.61.
Counter-bids are expect-
ed from the likes of Diageo
PLC and Pernod Ricard SA,
none of which has signifi-
cant Australian wine assets,
making such an acquisition
ideal. Interest may also come
from Constellation Brands
Inc., which has a significant
Australian presence already
and has bought California’s
Robert Mondavi Inc.
During the past year, shares
in Southcorp have risen
a staggering 75% on hopes
it will be taken over and on
expectations of a turnaround
in the US wine market, a par-
ticularly strong market for
the corporation.
Shares in Fosters ended
down 7% at $5.27 each as
some investors worried about
integration risks and pros-
pects for a protracted and
expensive bidding war; this
led to the stock touching a
two month low of $5.22 during
the day.
Fosters CEO, Trevor
O’Hoy, described the offer
as a “great price” and “out-
standing opportunity” for
Southcorp shareholders. This
should come as no surprise;
many would say the same
thing.
Dodgy dollar: will US deficits lead to a cash crisis?
