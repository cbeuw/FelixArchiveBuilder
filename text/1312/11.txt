Silwood Park Correspondent
The end of the calendar year
had come at last. For most
of the Silwood residents,
Christmas is a stressful time
of the year, with exams before
and after the break, and a
quiet time for those who are
not going home.
Before we departed, we
had a couple of days to let off
some steam. This year saw
the return of the much-loved
Silwood review, a light-heart-
ed look at the world of science
and life on the campus over
the past year. It is a night
loved by all, a time to get a
beer and have a laugh, with
the added bonus of raising
money for charity. It is a night
like no other, where every-
one is put on a level playing
field, from the gardeners to
the campus Dean, everyone
laughs at others’ expense and
then doesn’t complain when
the jokes come on to them.
This year’s story took a
panto tale and added an ele-
ment of Silwood individual-
ism. Dick Whittington leaves
his PhD at Silwood with his
subconscious bunny compan-
ion, in search of fame after
being fed up with living in
the middle of nowhere. After
coming across many interest-
ing characters on his travels,
a Brummie-accented voice
from above tells him to go
back to Silwood and run for
Union President against the
campus Dean.
On his returning trip, he
passes a Richard and Judy
show, our Union President on
blind date picking a romantic
holiday with his supervisor,
and course organisers try-
ing to explain and justify why
one course consists solely of
female students. At one point,
somehow, all the senior lec-
turers end up on stage doing
the ‘macarena’.
After some strenuous cam-
paigning, Dick wins and is
worshipped by all Silwood
residents, gets his girlfriend
back from the Dean, and they
live happily every after (with
the exception of some senior
lecturers who were left trau-
matised). Congratulations
have to be given to Tom
Ezard, Kelly Moyes and Katy
Barton for scriptwriting and
organising the rabble.
The following morning was
Christmas Day (a little bit
early, admittedly, being the
17th). The day started off
bright and early. Well, early
yes, bright no! Our traditional
Christmas morning fun run
was welcomed with wind and
rain, which made it a little
less fun! But did that stop any-
one, of course! The Christmas
fairy, a few elves, a superhero
and even the Christmas tree
had dragged themselves out
of bed to do the three mile
run/walk around the grounds
and roads of Silwood. For the
more serious runners, this
was not even a walk in the
park and they had finished
long before the vat of mulled
wine and tray of mince pies
were warmed up!
Once everyone had had a
chance to dry off, the day con-
tinued with the lazier resi-
dents finally getting out of bed
and joining everyone else in
the main hall for some expert-
ly sung Christmas carols, with
the odd serenade by a very
merry, slightly intoxicated,
Christmas tree! Christmas
dinner followed, with only
the odd attempt to catapult
food to neighbouring tables.
It was a serious scientific
experiment trying to get the
weight, shape and moistness
of a brussel sprout just right
that it would be projected off
the end of a party popper for
the correct distance, although
the winner had to be the age-
old flicking mince pudding off
a spoon.
The evening’s entertain-
ment commenced as we final-
ly managed to get a karaoke
machine and continued to
impress all of Silwood with
our singing ability...
The only person really wor-
thy of holding the microphone
was the Christmas fairy
with her rendition of Alanis
Morissette’s Ironic. However,
as the drink continued to flow,
this didn’t stop anyone from
believing they were the next
Britney Spears or Will Young.

AROUND THE WORLD IN
86 DAYS
12noon
Mech Eng room 220
In the summer of 2004, elec-
trical engineering student
James Devine spent his holi-
days travelling around the
world visiting construction
sites. The aim of this journey
was to gain a better under-
standing of sustainability and
sustainable issues in con-
struction.
The three month itiner-
ary included visits to Dubai,
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan,
Australia and the United
States. Whilst travelling,
James received a crash
course in global business
etiquette, including cultural
challenges as Sushi with con-
tractors in Japan, just like in
an HSBC advert.
James will be giving a lunch-
time talk going through some
details of what he learned
about sustainability, pictures
of the highlights from his trip
and advice for anyone looking
to organise their own ‘global’
internship.
