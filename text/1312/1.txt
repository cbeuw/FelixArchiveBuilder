As hall fees at Imperial
College look set to rise by
around 5%, the Union Council
is divided over its stance on
how rents are calculated
across the various different
halls.
The exact rent rises, which
will depend on the particu-
lar hall or type of room, will
be announced in the coming
weeks. There were disagree-
ments among student repre-
sentatives as to whether or
not rents should be based
on students’ ability to pay,
and whether or not certain
rooms should be overpriced
in order to make others
cheaper.
The overall cost of an
Imperial education is already
set to rise markedly for some
students with the introduc-
tion of £3000 ‘top-up’ tuition
fees in 2006.
The College currently guar-
antees all first year under-
graduates a place in hall.
By law, College Residences
must be self-funding. Each
February, the Head of
Residences recommends a
system of increasing rents
by different amounts in dif-
ferent halls and for differ-
ent types of room. This is
subsequently discussed by
the Rector’s Committee on
Student Residences (RCSR)
and the final decision rests
with the Rector.
The current hall applica-
tion form allows students
to express a preference for
room type (single, double,
triple, en-suite) and catered
or self-catered, but students
cannot choose a particular
hall or specify a price range.
In recent years, rent
increases have been much
higher in the more expen-
sive halls than in the cheaper
ones. Students living in the
more expensive halls, espe-
cially Beit, are subsidising
those living in cheaper halls
as a result. One argument is
that students living in Beit
can afford higher increases,
whilst those elsewhere are
less well off and hence can-
not.
A Beit Hall resident told
Felix: “The system really
needs improving. Beit Hall
is great but is it really worth
£125 a week? And why should
I pay over the odds to make
the cheap halls cheaper?
What’s that about?”
At Tuesday’s meeting of
Union Council, student repre-
sentatives considered three
options.
Option ‘A’ was to maintain
the status quo, but ask stu-
dents to indicate the price
range they are prepared to
pay. Expensive halls would
take most of the rent rises,
subsidising cheaper halls.
Option ‘B’ was to spread out
the rent rises more evenly,
removing the artificial pre-
mium for rooms in the more
expensive halls. Students’
ability to pay would affect
their rent.
Option ‘C’ was the same as
‘B’ but with no link between
rent and ability to pay.
Just over half the Council
expressed an initial pref-
erence for option ‘B’. After
a lengthy discussion, a
slightly amended version
of this option was narrowly
defeated. A number of del-
egates supported option ‘A’.
Interestingly, the only people
in support of option ‘C’ were
the President and the Deputy
President (Education and
Welfare), who prepared the
paper and who represent the
Union to the RCSR.
Sam Rorke, the Deputy
President (Education and
Welfare), said: “We had a
useful discussion and I look
forward to returning to the
issue in the future.” When
asked why he did not sup-
port a link between rents
and ability to pay, Mr Rorke
pointed out that “there are
already other mechanisms
for students suffering finan-
cial hardship”.
Sharine Brown, Head
of Residences at Imperial
College, told Felix: “Our rents
compare favourably with
other London universities
and with the private sector.”
She said that rents were like-
ly to increase above inflation
due to high costs in areas
such as construction, clean-
ing and utilities.
Felix will bring you details
of the RCSR’s decision and
the finalised rent increases
later this term.

Students living in Beit Hall are likely to pay upwards of £130 per week in accommodation
fees next year. Part of this cost is currently used to subsidise cheaper rooms elsewhere
