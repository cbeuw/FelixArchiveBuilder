In an interstellar burst, I’m back to
set another crossword. This one’s a
bit different from the usual, as you’ll
have noticed. This type of puzzle
is called ‘barred’ (as opposed to
‘blocked’). The most important fea-
ture of barred puzzles is that very
few letters are left unchecked, i.e.
without confirmation from another
answer. This has two tangible con-
sequences. The first is that they
often include more recondite words
(eg 7 down), as the grids are harder
to fill. The second is that their clues
can be easier to solve, as you can
have fewer blanks. These two mili-
tate against each other, and I hope
that here the balance is in favour of
the second. Happy solving!

Continued from page 24
Mathias did a three pint chal-
lenge in about 41 seconds.
The night finished and eve-
ryone piled in the cab back to
our tournament accommoda-
tion.
The Next Morning
Everyone woke up at around
eight and headed, hangovers
and all, by car to the sports
centre. Apparently, the WAS
team had three of their six
players throw up before get-
ting home, one of which was
out of the window of the taxi
(without the taxi driver know-
ing, more impressively). One
player was so hung over that
they had sent their brother
to play the first match on
their behalf. It did take the
team a while to explain that
he wasn’t allowed to push the
opposition whilst marking
them!
Disc Doctors 4
Bears 4 2
Let’s be blunt. We weren’t
expecting too much energy
from the first game. There
was much panting and
numerous dodgy discs from
both teams.
DD did score early on, but
they also had more chances
that they should have scored
from. The Bears were trying
hard but were often stopped
early by DD players for a
quick turnover and endzone
attempt.
Bears 3 7
Disc Doctors 6
After Saturday’s close game,
Bears 3 were out for revenge
and the team pulled no
punches. It was everybody’s
last game of the tournament,
and the final aim was to come
out fighting.
DD started off calm and col-
lected,scoringtwopointsfrom
two good passes to Mathias
followed by Stas. Sarah, Matt,
Mary and George played their
hearts out, resisting the pres-
sure from the cheering Bears
crowd.
With the score level at five
all, “slogging your guts out”
would have been an under-
statement. The game was
unbelievably tense as the
scores matched at 6–6. Bears
went ahead 7–6 with 30 sec-
onds to go and, despite their
attempt, the Disc Doctors
just could not get the last
point. This was a fantastic
game, the best one of the
tournament, just going to
show that in Ultimate you
should never give up, even if
the game doesn’t count for
much.
With all games finished and
the day over, all teams sat
down for the presentation.
Every team was given a bot-
tle of vodka to take home.
Finally ranked 18 out of 20,
captain Stylish went up to col-
lect the Disc Doctors’ prized
vodka.
With the spoon winners
WAS, the plate winners
Grizzlies and the final winners
Vice (by only two points), the
group decided it had been a
great weekend. Disc Doctors
said their thanks to the hosts
and picked up a much-needed
Burger King, before taking
the train back to London in
order to collapse!

ICSM Men’s 3rd 3
St George’s Men’s 2nd 0
By Tristan Lane
A crucial BUSA and ULU
double header was contested
in the watery sunlight of a
beautiful Chiswick afternoon.
Or something equally poetic.
Classic sporting spirit
was on display from both
sides, with the perfect level
of aggression shown. There
were no arguments more
than a couple of words, and
happy smiling faces all round
at the end. What more could
you want? A close sporting
contest? Done.
It was a fantastic game.
Though ICSM dominated,
often with eight or nine play-
ers camped in the opposi-
tion half for minutes on end,
George’s would eventually
release the pressure with a
classicArsenal-inspiredbreak
that at the very least kept our
goalkeeper Rao entertained
(he who complained at never
doing anything). For the first
game after Christmas, it was
a bravura display from the
Thirds, with everyone playing
their best game this season. It
might be down to pride, or the
fact that the team has played
together virtually unchanged
all season. Personally I put it
down to sheer freakish luck.
We started the game slight-
ly apprehensive – rumour
had it that they had a South of
England ringer in their midst,
but we managed to conquer
that demon by spending
the entire first five minutes
camped in their half. This
initial domination settled the
team down and we started to
play some champagne hock-
ey. There were runs, spins,
and even passes. However,
this domination didn’t lead
to goals. For all our attack-
ing prowess, George’s man-
aged to put up an impressive
defensive display and looked
to counter at every availa-
ble opportunity. Fortunately
our defensive boys were also
playing like legends, just like
the guys up front.
Eventually, after many
chances flashed past the goal
or straight to the keeper, the
pressure paid off with Avi,
newly promoted from defence
to wing, popping his cherry
like a pro with a deft finish
after some ping-pong action
in the goal-mouth. One-nil.
Despite trying to up our
game even further for the
rest of the half, wary of a
quick break, we couldn’t force
a breakthrough and Rao was
called upon to make some
cracking interventions. After
half time it remained much
the same – lots of pressure,
little breakthrough. Until sud-
denly, from out of nowhere,
Terry slapped in a cheeky lit-
tle number. Two-nil.
Then, straight from the re-
start, a bit of devilry from our
forwards stole the ball, and
with a little bit of faffing Terry
slammed it straight into the
back of their net to make it
three-nil. Credit to George’s,
who came back for more and
didn’t let their heads drop.
The last ten minutes allowed
Terry some cracking hat-trick
avoidance, but by then it was
already tied up.
This was frankly the best
game of hockey that I’ve ever
played – fun, tiring and bloody
good spirit. Exactly what’s
needed on a Wednesday after-
noon! And Rao didn’t even get
sent off!
