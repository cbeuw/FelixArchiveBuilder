What would you get if you threw
together a wholesome family adven-
ture with a big Hollywood name,
a fetching female sidekick and a
million references to the American
Declaration of Independence?
That’s right! A nice little action-
packed Disney movie called
National Treasure. Stick in super-
producer Jerry Bruckheimer and
you have a recipe for box office
success.
National Treasure tells the story
of one man’s quest for the ultimate
prize – a treasure so wonderful that
several generations of his family
had spent their lives (and their fam-
ily fortune) in search of it.
According to legend, since the
dawn of civilisation a hoard of
priceless objects has been build-
ing, fought over by everyone includ-
ing the ancient Egyptians, Romans
and Greeks. This treasure had been
passed down through the ages until
it was discovered by the mysterious
Templar Knights who decided that
it was too great to be possessed
by any one person. Over time, the
Knights became known as a secret
society, the Free Masons, leading
to the treasure being hidden during
the American war of Independence
by the US’s Founding Fathers. It
has been lost ever since.
This is where our hero Benjamin
Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage)
comes in. He is beginning the last
stages of his family quest, which
leads him to steal The Declaration
of Independence which cleverly has
the treasure map on the back of it.
Cage plays the lead with humour
and gives his character the dog-
gedly determined nature and infi-
nite intelligence that one would cer-
tainly need in order to get from one
‘clue’ to the next, because there are
an awful lot of clues.
The makers of this film seemed
to have tried to squeeze in as
much American history as possi-
ble. Clues are everywhere – on the
Liberty Bell, the letters of Benjamin
Franklin, Wall Street and even the
one hundred dollar bill. It is, there-
fore, just a little far fetched for them
to expect us to believe that the
American Founding Fathers had the
time and wit to devise such cryptic
messages.
It is even more difficult to believe
that one man could possibly follow
this hopeless trail. But follow it he
does, and he is not alone, accom-
panied by his young sidekick, Riley
(Justin Bartha), and Abigail (Diane
Kruger). Sean Bean is also along
for the ride and is again typecast as
the villainous Englishman who will
do anything to get his hands on the
prize. Cameo appearances by two
Hollywood legends also help to add
acting weight to this picture.
The film is slightly jagged and
uneven, with the first hour made
up of a few action sequences and
long periods of clue deciphering.
However, as the end draws near, all
things intellectual are left behind
as chase sequences and shoot-outs
dominate. There is not enough vio-
lence to terrify little children but
just enough to keep an older audi-
ence watching.
Cage and Kruger have a nice
dynamic between them, as their
characters start out with a relation-
ship of animosity that later leads
to mutual respect. There are many
scenes spent lingering on the fact
that the Declaration is the most
important document in history
which is, of course, only Hollywood’s
interpretation of reality. Not know-
ing that much about American his-
tory, I also could not dispute how
the story has been woven with
the events that happened during
American’s emancipation from the
British. But even to my uneducated
mind, I think there has been just a
little bit of artistic licence taken.
National Treasure has proven
to be a big box office draw in the
United States, but it seems a little
too patriotic to do very well here. I
did enjoy the film, but only because
of the enduring Indiana Jones feel
to it. I would recommend it only to
those who appreciate this kind of
movie. Mandirassa Osakonor

National Treasure: the first spin-off from the highly successful Dan Brown novel The Da Vinci Code
Veer-Zaara: a love legend
Director Yash Chopra brings us a
tale of love, courage and integrity.
The aim of this movie was to over-
pass the differences between Indian
andPakistanipeople(again)through
a ‘forbidden’ love story between
an Indian pilot, Veer Pratap Singh
(Shah Rukh Khan), and a Pakistani
girl, Zaara Hayaat (Preity Zinta).
Hence the title of the movie: Veer-
Zaara.
Before going any further, the
author would like you to consid-
er the possibility of a rescue pilot
who sits in prison without speaking
to anyone for 22 years but upon
meeting a young beautiful Pakistani
lawyer Saamiya Siddiqui (Rani
Mukerji), who calls him by his name
as opposed to his prison number,
decides to speak. Not only does he
speak, he tells his whole past to
her, which keeps the movie going
for three hours. So you would have
to let your imagination run wild,
suspend you sense of disbelief and
belief in impossibly passionate love
between two people. Just a little.
The past starts off with Veer, a
rescue pilot. He meets a carefree
and beautiful girl, Zaara, who came
to India to fulfil her nanny’s dying
wish. Zaara is trapped, due to a bus
accident, and Veer saves her, which
leads to an unshakable bond that
eventually ties them up in uncondi-
tional and irreversible love. Veer is
mesmerised by Zaara’s beauty and
morals while Zaara is swept away by
Veer’s passion to help others and his
undying love for her.
The story also includes the colour-
ful and merry set of Veer’s home
town Punjab, where Zaara meets
his uncle (cameo part for Amitabh
Bachchan) and aunt (Hema Malini),
his foster parents. This couple do
nothing but argue adorably during
their scenes and you can’t just help
smiling throughout their lines. This
gives a hint of comedy to the movie.
After this innocent visit of Zaara’s to
India, Veer’s life is never the same
as destiny has a different ‘ending’ to
their ‘happily ever after’.
However, this movie does tend to
seem like a normal romantic love
story where boy meets girl: both
fall in love, the parents resent it,
therefore girl has to marry the guy
chosen by her parents, then coura-
geously, the man goes over to the
girl’s house to win over the girl.
Though this film does have this sce-
nario, there is a little surprise from
the master of romantic movies. The
story is moved across two nations
with different cultures. It isn’t just
a love legend, but a transformation
of Veer. The audience is kept riveted
with twists that change the current
air of the movie.
This is a simple tale of immense
nobility and idealism that may
strike some viewers as implausable.
Modern day isn’t filled with demean-
our, speech, attitude and emotions
that bring out the human spirit. That
doesn’t mean we can’t let ourselves
be immersed into an idealistic love
tale. After all, when you add the
amazing shades of emotions thrown
by Shah Rukh (including the won-
derful facial expressions) with the
cheerful and down-to-earth acting
of Preity and the overly-teary but
confident scenes of Rani Mukerji
to the utterly beautiful theme song,
this movie allows you to surrender
to the romantic passion between
Veer and Zaara. It’s as simple as
falling in love.
The score, with lyrics by Javed
Akhtar and music composed by
the legendary late Madan Mohan,
comes with an outstanding quality
of sound that reminds us how far
Bollywood movie music has come.
The soundtrack takes you to places
where the heart dances and the soul
sings out in pure bliss. It’s a lovely
feast for the ears. Movie music can-
not get any more intimate. Putting
together this music with colour-
ful dresses, beautiful scenery and
good choreography brings up a good
entertainment.
In short, Veer Zaara is a movie
that will appeal to nearly all who
have imagination beyond realism.
However it does lack an innovative
plot structure.
This is a movie that will make you
laugh and cry. All in all, it’s an emo-
tional film that certainly needs to
be seen, if only because Shah Rukh
Khan is in it.
