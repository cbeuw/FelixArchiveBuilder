Creationist textbook stickers declared unconstitutional
By Zoë Corbyn
Science Communcation
“Be very, very careful what
you put into that head,
because you will never, ever
get it out” – Cardinal Wolsey
(c1473 – 1530)
In the United States, the
Georgian school district that
added stickers to high school
biology textbooks saying
that evolution is “a theory,
not a fact” has been ordered
to remove them. A federal
judge ruled last Thursday
(13 January) that the stick-
ers were an unconstitutional
endorsement of religion.
Officials from the Cobb
County School District, in
suburban Atlanta, put the
stickers inside the books’
front covers in 2002. They
read: “This textbook con-
tains material on evolution.
Evolution is a theory, not a
fact, regarding the origin of
living things. This material
should be approached with an
open mind, studies carefully
and critically considered”.
The stickers were to counter
criticism from over 2,000 par-
ents that the new textbooks
did not include information
about creationism or ‘intel-
ligent design’. The case was
bought by the American Civil
Liberties Union on behalf of
five parents concerned that
the stickers encouraged their
children to reject the scientif-
ic theory of evolution in favour
of a religious view on origin.
According to the decision:
“The sticker sends a message
to those who oppose evolution
for religious reasons that they
are the favoured members of
the political community, while
the sticker sends a message
to those who believe in evo-
lution that they are political
outsiders. This is particularly
so in a case such as this one
involving impressionable pub-
lic school students who are
likely to view the message
on the sticker as a union of
church and state.”
The basis for the decision
is interesting, hinging on
whether the stickers violated
the Establishment Clause of
the First Amendment of the
United States Constitution.
This clause states that
“Congress shall make no law
respecting an establishment
of religion, or prohibiting
the free exercise thereof”,
and also applies to states. It
means the government must
“pursue a course of complete
neutrality towards religion”.
In his decision, the judge
took the viewpoint of an
informed, reasonable observ-
er – someone aware of the
events leading to the adop-
tion of the sticker and that
the language of the sticker
essentially mirrored the view-
point of religiously motivated
citizens. Even though the
sticker may not have explic-
itly advanced a particular reli-
gious viewpoint, considered
in context, the judge decided
that an informed, reasonable
observer would take the stick-
er to mean that the School
Board agreed with the beliefs
of the Christian fundamen-
talists and the creationists.
The judge concluded, there-
fore, that the stickers must
be declared unconstitutional.
“It coveys an impermissible
message of endorsement” he
said. “The Board has effec-
tively improperly entangled
itself with religion by appear-
ing to take a position”.
The stickers, funded with
taxpayers money, were
also found to violate the
Constitution of the State of
Georgia. This says that: “No
money shall ever be taken
from the public treasury,
directly or indirectly, in aid
of any church, sect, cult or
religious denomination or any
sectarian institution”.
The areas outside the scope
of the case should also be
noted. Namely, the case did
not consider whether science
and religion are mutually
exclusive (it took no position
on the origin of the human
species); whether it is con-
stitutionally permissible for
state school teachers to teach
creation; or whether evolu-
tion is a fact or theory or how
it should be taught.
In the US, there is a long
history of Christian funda-
mentalists and creationists
opposing evolution. As early
as the 1920s and continuing
into the late 1960s, the judicial
system was resolving chal-
lenges to anti-evolution stat-
utes, which made it criminal
to teach evolution is schools.
Several other states, includ-
ing Ohio and Tennessee, have
recently sought to force the
teaching of creationism is
schools, but these have been
repeatedly struck down by
the US Supreme Court as
unconstitutional. In 1987, the
US Supreme Court ruled that
creationism was a religious
belief that could not be taught
in state schools along with
evolution.
In this age, people should
be permitted to learn science
unadulterated by religious
doctrine. The American Civil
Liberties Union is to be com-
mended for its vigilance in
this and other cases. The sci-
entific community certainly
has a lot to be grateful for.

Huygens schm-uygens
I’m tired of reading all these lib-
eral apologists making excuses
for the Huygens mission.
Space-turkey
It may have travelled over a
billion miles across the solar
system, survived the harsh
Titan atmosphere, landed with
pin-point cruise missile accura-
cy, and expanded the frontiers
of space exploration, but let’s
face it...
The pictures were rubbish.
They were so bad that at first
ESA mission control thought
they had taken the wrong
turn at Jupiter and landed on
Mars.
How a $2 billion dollar mis-
sion can’t afford to hook up
a decent digital camera is
beyond me.
They do digital at Dixons for
£32 nowadays: no excuse.
And to these people who say
that the mission will reveal con-
ditions on a primitive earth, I
say...
Surely if they spent the bil-
lions on time travel (something
I have always advocated) they
would have found the answer
more easily.
65 yr old Romanian
pensioner gives birth
It’s a testament to the sick
and twisted minds of GM sci-
entists that they decided to
implant a cow embryo in the
old Romanian woman in the
first place.
Horror
It’s not funny and not clever
and I might add that despite
being a staunch advocate of
GM crops (and consumer, I
might add) I have to stand by
my guns and say:
This GM train has careered
off the rails. Let’s stop the mad-
ness of calf implantation before
your cat starts giving birth to
puppies.
Comet probe take-off
I think you’d all join me in wish-
ing the best of success to
NASA’s Deep Impact mission
which took off this week.
The mission has been
designed to crash into comet
Tempel 1 and take out its nucle-
us and the future of the human
race depends on it.
Scientists have proven that
comets pose a dangerous
threat to the planet.
Imagine Wales flying straight
at Planet Earth at over 3000 kil-
ometres per second and you’ll
be in the right, albeit danger-
ous, ballpark.
It was also revealed this
week that the Comet poses a
threat to some of the world’s
most sacred archeological
treasures:
According to a NASA
source, “Deep Impact could
punch a crater in the comet
big enough to swallow Rome’s
Colisseum”.
Shuddering thought.

The news on Earth this week:
robbers armed with samurai
swords hold up McDonalds
restaurant in Winnipeg, cops
in West Memphis use taser
to subdue nude jogger, ‘good’
crocodile saved Sri Lankan
pensioner during tsunami, and
finally, granny ends up in hos-
pital after mistaking superglue
for eyedrops.
Following the success of the
Huygens mission, it is almost
as if humans were destined to
go into space.
Withinthelastcentury,which
is equivalent just a millisecond
in the history of mankind and
a nanosecond in the history
of the Earth (I won’t bore you
with the calculations), humans
have managed to send astro-
nauts into space, land men on
the moon, put rovers on Mars,
and now land a probe over a
billion kilometres away on a
moon of Saturn.
It should be clear by now that
space is mankind’s most natu-
ral environment. Here we fight
and destroy one another and
the Earth’s environment, but
in space humans are forced to
collaborate and set aside their
differences for a truly common
cause. In this sense, Huygens
is a triumph because it was col-
laborative and has reminded
us again that space exploration
is an essential, if not the essen-
tial goal of mankind.
The coming decades will be
very important. The dangers
we will be facing for centuries
to come are overpopulation,
the destruction of the envi-
ronment, a decreasing sup-
ply of raw materials, intellec-
tual deficiencies and malaise
throughout populations, and
a resurgence of religious fun-
damentalism both in the East
and the West.
Unfortunately, at this point,
we are not all united as to what
needstobedone.Buttheexplo-
ration of space does provide a
common purpose. So, bearing
in my mind that with every set-
back (such as the Challenger
and Columbia disasters) there
are calls to abandon the space
programme, it is the respon-
sibility of all scientists to pro-
mote space exploration.
