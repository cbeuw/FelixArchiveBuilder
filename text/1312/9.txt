Pay problems
Dave,
In response to your front page arti-
cle ‘Pay problems for student staff’
in last week’s Felix:
I have been working here for over
two years now. The fact that it takes
six weeks to get pay for some shifts
is of course ridiculous, but I think the
most important part of your article
to highlight was what Mustafa Arif
had to say about non-student casual
staff still being paid weekly!
When the change happened, we
were told that it was necessary for
us to have our pay scheme changed
in order to bring us in line with the
rest of college’s staff, as this would
reduce costs in payroll. The fact that
there are still staff being paid weekly
by college payroll enforces my belief
that it was not necessary to fast-
track all of us student staff onto the
scheme. There could have been far
more time for negotiation with the
Union and planning by the college
to make sure that if it did eventually
become truly necessary for us to be
on monthly pay, it could have gone
ahead without all the glitches we
have experienced. These included
not being paid, being paid too much,
tax and NI not being deducted, emer-
gency tax being deducted and so on
ad infinitum...
Perhaps, too, if we had been
warned of this change, those of us
who are hard up enough to need our
cash “up front” would have had a
chance to make alternative arrange-
ments before the start of term. It
would have been even nicer if we
had been consulted on the change,
but then again, as it seems that
Mustafa himself was barely consult-
ed, that might be like asking for the
moon on a stick.
Yours,

Security and medics
Dear Felix,
Today, Tuesday 18 January, a student
had a fit in the entrance hall of the
Sir Alexander Fleming Building.
Students present at the time
were reported to have done nothing
except continue to purchase their
food from the shop while watch-
ing on. Eventually a student had
the sense to ring Sherfield Security
(of which there should be a fully
trained medical officer at all times),
after which four (allegedly) burly
but medically incompetent guards
appeared with no first aid equip-
ment and proceeded to join in the
staring contest.
Paramedics were eventually called
and arrived within minutes and dealt
with the situation accordingly. One
of the students who originally aided
the suffering student was rewarded
by a ‘Well done miss,’ by one of the
security officers.
Lessons to be learnt from this:
Sherfield Security need to review
their procedures for first aid train-
ing; medical students really don’t
know what they’re doing even when
threatened with a real life situation.
Kind regards,

More exam anguish
Dear Felix,
I’d like to write a short response to
Mr Rorke’s letter in issue 1311.
Can I just point out that I person-
ally pointed out to Mr Rorke the
issues several weeks before the end
of the autumn term and heard noth-
ing back from him on the subject
and it was up to the students them-
selves within their departments to
kick up a fuss to get their exam
dates changed! Surely since dates
are confirmed two years in advance
as (Sam so courteously pointed out
to the readership), the DPEWs of the
last three years had plenty of time to
realise the problem far earlier?
Yet another example of the union’s
bumbling inability to see into the
future and take preventative action,
leaving them shrugging their shoul-
ders and scratching themselves; let-
ting the students down inevitably.
Yours Sincerely,
Tim Weinert-Aplin

Dear Felix,
Two weeks ago I had a letter pub-
lished here. Despite it being anony-
mous I have since received some
reprecussions. I would like to re-iter-
ate the points in the article 2 weeks
ago.
1) In response to a Felix headline
last term I pointed out that Mech
Eng was not the only department
with a ridiculous Christmas period,
we in ESE also had problems – fault
for this in my opinion clearly lies
with college who set the term dates
– why we could not have started that
term earlier I do not know.
2) Also in response to a Felix head-
line last term, examinable material
(indeed an exam) was scheduled
in the lunch period – clashing with
some peoples humanities courses
(hence why nothing should be time-
tabled in the lunch hour). The only
option I was given was to sit it in
the afternoon, which clashed with
a departmental lecture. I eventu-
ally sat it then. I believe no student
should be put in this position – I do
not accept that Monday 3rd being a
Bank Holiday as an excuse, it has
been scheduled then for a long time.
If exams were indeed supposed to
have being scheduled for the ‘first
Monday’ of term (10th) then there
would not be a full day of departmen-
tal lectures that day. I believe blame
for this lies with the department,
as other departments don’t seem to
have had this problem.
The point I was trying to make
was that individually these problems
would not have been that bad but
combined between them they could
cause students great distress in
what is an important year of there
degree.
I would also like to point out and
apologise to the secretarial staff of
the department, who may have mis-
understood the article, I believe they
are not at fault for the above prob-
lems, the job they perform, which
includes being a link between stu-
dents and the department is per-
formed consistently in a faultless
manner with a cheerful attitude, and
all the more admirable bearing in
mind the “fluid and laissez faire”
nature of the department (as dis-
cussed above and in my previous
letter).
Thankyou

Babar Ahmad
Dear Felix,
We, the family of Babar Ahmad,
reject outright and condemn the
decision of the Independent Police
Complaint’s Commission (IPCC) to
formally discipline one of the sev-
eral Anti-Terrorist Branch Police
Officers who caused life-threaten-
ing injuries to Babar whilst in their
custody on 02 December 2003. We
further question the timing of this
decision, more than a year after the
assault, and a week prior to BBC2’s
documentary on Babar’s case on
26th January 2005. We feel that this
is a cynical ploy to create a scape-
goat out of one officer to spare the
superiors from blame.
Our faith in the British Justice
System is such that we always
expected a “cover-up” from the
outset, but we did not expect the
IPCC, Crown Prosecution Service
and members of the medical pro-
fession to be part of it. This is the
fourth time that the authorities have
charged their version of events of
what happened to Babar on that
day. First they declared in court that
Babar’s injuries were old injuries.
Then they said that “some” of the
injuries were old. Then they said that
Babar kicked, punched and violently
resisted arrest. Now they are saying
that the injuries were not old and
some of the officers used excessive
force. They have also claimed that
the officers acted as such because
they believed Babar to be a highly
dangerous terrorist who trained in
Al-Qaida camps.
This latest decision leaves a
number of questions unanswered:
1) If Babar violently resisted arrest
and attacked police officers, why
was he not charged with assaulting
police?
2) Where is the medical evidence
of any injuries sustained by the
police officers?
3) If only one police officer assault-
ed Babar, why did the others stand
there and watch?
4) Why did 3 independent eye-
witnesses (neighbours) inform the
investigation that they did not wit-
ness any struggle?
5) WhyhasBabar not been charged
with making false allegations against
members of the police?
6) If Babar was a highly danger-
ous Al-Qaida terrorist, why was
he released without charge in
December 2003?
7) Why did the IPCC ignore the
opinion of Dr Manolis Gavalas, an
independent medico-legal expert
who examined Babar?
We would like all of the officers
concerned to be charged and pros-
ecuted, not just disciplined with a
slap on the wrist. We are consider-
ing taking further action and we
seek an urgent independent public
inquiry into this matter.

Fun in Felix?
It saddens me to write this. In years
gone by, the pages of noble Felix
were filled with interesting columns
and funny stories. So much so in fact
that my vastly inferior writing skills
were never called upon. Now, howev-
er, things have changed. Very much
for the worse. First we lose the for-
mat for cost reasons – fair enough.
But did you have to cull all the writ-
ers as well? I mean you didn’t even
pay them. They had vision, skills and
possibly even ideas.
The idea of a student paper is not
to deliver daily news from the busi-
ness world, or even daily national
news. That’s what actual newspa-
pers are for. A student paper should
offer information about student life
– funny events, places to eat, general
crude. It should be interesting. Fair
enough we’re all geeky enough to
appreciate computers and gadgets.
But maybe more reviews of games
and funky stuff and less dry pieces
about operating systems – which
as anyone knows, aren’t interesting,
even to mac fanatics.
You need to have information on
how the university is being run and
plans for the future. You also need
to have columns on how wonderful
donuts are and how ignoring dead-
lines seriously reduces dancing abil-
ity at dB’s. However, these shouldn’t
necessarily be vying for space in the
same column.
So what needs to be done?
Basically there needs to be a drive
back towards fun – everyone needs
a break from knowledge occasionally
surely? Is there really no place for
fannying about? What are we, seri-
ous scientists or students? There is
so much more to life than studying.
I mean really there is. No matter
how much you pay to study, you’re
missing out on the whole aim of uni-
versity if you use it just to work. Like
meeting people, having fun, maybe
even putting something back into the
uni and/or the community. But obvi-
ously it is not obligatory – I would
not be where I am today if it weren’t
for my highly developed sense of
apathy and a keen knowledge of how
best to avoid doing stuff. Still I know
that occasionally a little effort makes
everything better. In this instance,
it is mainly that if by some quirk of
fate I manage to encourage peo-
ple to write something, I will have
something to read and I won’t have
to spend weeks deciding whether
or not to write something instead
of staring blankly into the Mission
Failed screen of GTA 3.

Dave Edwards, Editor, replies:
Felix is a popular newspaper this
year. Almost all of our 4000 cop-
ies disappear quickly each week. I
have received more compliments
on the new style of Felix than I could
possibly count.
Cost was only one factor behind
the change of format. The new ‘com-
pact newspaper’ style defines Felix
as a student newspaper, rather than
lying somewhere between newspa-
per and magazine. The new style
looks more like a ‘real’ publication
and is taken more seriously and
given more respect as a result.
We didn’t cull any writers – they
either left College or just stopped
writing, unfortunately. To imply
that our current team of contribu-
tors lacks vision, skill and ideas is
a cheap and ultimately pointless
insult to these hard-working, tal-
ented volunteers.
Many Imperial students are inter-
ested in national and/or business
news, and we are able to give a
limited amount from our own per-
spective, so why shouldn’t we do
that? The operating system articles
have attracted several comments
and questions from readers – it’s
clear that people are interested in
that kind of thing.
Of course there is space for ‘fun’
articles, but we need people to write
them. Incidentally, Coffee Break
already offers two pages of fun
and games each week. I’m not sure
that we should be offering ‘general
crude’, whatever that is.
Any student is welcome to write
for Felix. We really do want as many
people as possible to get involved
– it’s what we’re here for, and we
include something like 80-90% of
what we receive. I accept that there
is less fun, comedy, humorous col-
umns etc in Felix this year, but that’s
only because no-one seems to want
to write them! If there’s something
you want to see in these pages, you
can do something about it – either
make a specific suggestion or write
it yourself. Contact me at felix@ic.
