Photographer Anna (Julia Roberts)
meets Dan (Jude Law), an aspirant
novelist at a photo shoot. However,
at that time, Dan is dating Alice
(Natalie Portman) and Anna has just
come out from a divorce. As time
goes by, Anna meets and marries
dermatologist Larry (Clive Owen),
and Dan and Alice are still dating.
This ‘minute’ problem of both Anna
and Dan being ‘taken’ does not stop
them from having a secret affair.
Director Mike Nichols brings out
the four characters in Closer; based
on Patrick Marber’s 1997 London
play.
The movie uses words as weap-
ons. Weapons of conquest for the
need of falling in love and weapons
that wound cruelly when they want
out of love. This is an invitation of
pure coldness at heart and the feel
of disgust for the fragile four-letter
word. Obviously, when words don’t
work, sex is used as the ultimate
weapon of mass destruction.
It is an endless infliction of deceit
and pain. Some may find this
movie truthful or revealing. But
some may find the characters
immoral, shallow, cruel and twisted
in their own ways. At the end of
the day, there isn’t a character that
you can stand up for. The improper,
spiteful, predictable games played
by Dan and Larry turn their girl-
friends to an increasingly depres-
sive state, even though this movie
never loses its gloomy surface of
sexual deception.
Yours truly saw Closer in a sold-
out theatre. As there were so many
people, and as it has received such
praise, one would expect this to
be a great movie. The story starts
off nicely, with the first line being
“Hello, stranger”, and the theme of
relationships of strangers is carried
throughout the movie. Everyone
meets as strangers.
Leaps in time keep the viewers
confused for the first minute of each
jump. Why couldn’t there have been
“one year later” at the bottom of the
screen?
After the first half of the movie, you
just can’t help but wonder, why this
obsession? At the end of the movie,
you do nothing but wonder, what’s
the point? Was there a punchline
somewhere that was missed?
However, the dialogue in this film
has as a superior rhythm of smart,
quick and witty lines. It is hilarious
and unbelievably hurtful (the truth
does hurt). It is put together with
short, melodramatic, quiet sentenc-
es that signify the strength of mind
and the weakness of the body. The
opening music (Damien Rice – The
Blowers Daughter) will be stuck in
your head for ages.
It is based on ruthless, pitiless,
sad, sorry people cheating on each
other because they can and because
it feels good. The boredom does
catch on after a while into the movie.
After all, Closer is based on a stage
play and it must have worked in that
way. It would still be petty, sleazy
and disgusting, though it thinks it is
influential, outrageous and uncom-
promising.
The film tries so hard to be multi-
layered and meaningful, with char-
acters begging for each other to be
completely honest with them and
talking about the nature of truth.
But each one of them is so selfish
and mean that it is hard to even
bother to care.
If these are typical modern rela-
tionships then it is no wonder there
are so many single people. For all
its efforts to be refreshingly honest,
Closer just comes across as annoy-
ingly childish and cynical. Watching
this is like watching Eastenders
with all the sleeping around.
At the end of the movie, you just
feel so depressed. It is for the griev-
ing heart.
Closer to perfection or perversion?
Closer has been touted as one of the best movies of the year, with numerous nominations
and awards. Vidula Vinayagamoorthy can’t really see why

A cheeky glance
Stupidity and political incorrectness at its best
Who remembers Thunderbirds? To
recap, they were an elite squadron
charged with the responsibility of
ensuring world security. However,
history will remember them more
for the animation techniques that
brought them to life.
Forty years on, with modern tech-
nology, it would be reasonable to
assume that films where you could
see the cast’s strings as they move
were consigned to an era gone by.
Wrong!
In their latest masterpiece, South
Park creators Trey Parker and
Matt Stone use their unique brand
of humour to lampoon the war on
terror. The film follows the elite
‘Team America’, whose mission is to
ensure that the world remains safe
from the terrorists, giving the pup-
pets a chance to show that they can
save the world from 21st century
bad guys.
From the opening scene where
the team “accidentally” destroy half
of Paris through to the profound
“dicks, pussy and assholes” speech,
this film was designed to offend eve-
ryone in equal measure, regardless
of their politics. The captions that
position Paris and Cairo relative to
their distance from America and the
distance from the Panama Canal to
the “real” America provide an excel-
lent geography lesson for slack-
jawed yokels, but all this hard work
would result them in being reward-
ed with seeing the mouthpiece of the
sanctimonious left, Michael Moore,
suicide-bomb the Mount Rushmore
headquarters of the Team.
Wanton destruction is a major
theme running through the film,
mocking the self-importance, insen-
sitivity to other cultures and lack of
empathy for non-US casualties of
American foreign policy. In addition
to the Eiffel Tower, Arc de Triamphe
and The Louvre, other structural
casualties include most of Egypt’s
ancient landmarks.
The most scathing criticism
is reserved for liberal Hollywood
actors and their well-intentioned
but misguided ventures into global
politics. Lead by the Film Actors
Guild (or FAG), they attempt to use
their acting powers to stop Team
America. They co-organise a world
peace conference with Kim Jong-Il,
who turns out to be in cahoots with
the terrorists planning to blow up
most of the world. Naturally, Team
America save the day in the most
unorthodox manner possible.
The fecklessness of the UN is also
spoofed. Hans Blix warns Kim Jong-
Il that if he does not have access to
all his palaces then the UN will write
him a letter saying that they are
‘very, very mad’ at him. At this point
Dr Blix becomes a snack for Kim
Jong-Il’s pet sharks with no hint of a
James Bond style escape.
This film is a must see. The plot
is ridiculous, the score obscene
and the humour about as dark as it
comes. It will have an effect on you
one way or the other: either you’ll
laugh to the point of explosion or fire
off letters to the production compa-
nies. If you are one of the sensitive
souls who is easily offended, this
film is not for you and my advice
would be stay at home and have a
cold shower in the hope that it might
thicken your skin.
