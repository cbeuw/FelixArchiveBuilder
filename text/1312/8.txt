No glove, no love
At university there is often a lot of
partying going on, and for many it is
a time when you spread your wings
and feel free. University is also a
time when many people discover
themselves sexually and, as the
your social experience increases,
it is often a chance for you to meet
new people and let some of your
barriers fall.
If you are sexually active it is often
easy to forget about the risks and
not protect yourself against sexu-
ally transmitted infections (STIs).
It is good to enjoy sex and feel good
about our relationships, but at some
point in your life you may find your-
self facing difficulties or problems
about your sexual health.
Staying sexually healthy is about
dealing with sexual problems as they
happen and avoiding them in the
first place. STIs are on the increase
in this country and it is important to
be aware of the risks and to protect
yourself from these infections.
There are at least 25 STIs, includ-
ing chlamydia, gonorrhoea and gen-
ital herpes. STIs are some of the
commonest infections around the
world and affect people of all ages,
races and sexualities. As well as
being easy to catch, we also know
that you’re more at risk from HIV
if you sleep with someone who is
already carrying an STI.
Whether you are straight, gay, bi
or transsexual, you need to protect
yourself against these infections by
using the right type of contracep-
tion. And you need to do this until
both you and your partner are sure
there’s no chance of either of you
catching or passing on an STI.
Here’s a list of some of the better-
known STIs:
Chlamydia
Symptoms: In women, this infection
often produces no symptoms, but
can block the fallopian tubes, caus-
ing fertility problems later. You may
notice slight discharge or pain on
urinating. In men, it often affects the
urethra and causes marked symp-
toms such as discharge or pain on
urinating, described as ‘non-specif-
ic-urethritis’ (NSU).
Treatment: Testing involves a spe-
cial swab, or urine or blood tests.
Treatment is with a specific type of
antibiotics, but it can require sev-
eral courses of tablets. Your sexual
partners should be contacted and
checked as well.
Gonorrhoea
Causes: Caused by a bacteria and
can affect the vagina, urethra, penis,
rectum and even the mouth if you
have oral sex.
Symptoms: Women tend to notice
a profuse, yellow or greenish watery
vaginal discharge and pain on uri-
nating. Men may see a yellowy green
discharge from the penis and have
pain on urinating. Itching or anal
discharge is also possible, though
some people get no symptoms at
all and carry the infection from one
partner to the next.
Treatment: There is a risk of dam-
age to your fallopian tubes, with
reduced fertility, if the infection is
not treated. If you have gonorrhoea,
you should not have sex until you
have had swabs done and a course
of antibiotic treatment. Your sexual
partners should be contacted and
checked, too.
Herpes
Causes: Herpes is a virus (herpes
simplex type II) similar to the one
that causes cold sores (herpes
simplex type I), and is transmitted
sexually. It’s possible to spread the
infection to the mouth during oral
sex and you might get type I infec-
tions in the genital area.
Symptoms: It can cause pain-
ful coldsore-like spots (ulceration)
around the vagina and the penis.
As with cold sores, once you’ve had
them, the virus stays in your system
throughout your life and could flare
up again.
Treatment: There are now anti-
viral antibiotics, which can be used
to control and reduce a ‘flare-up’,
but they aren’t a cure. If you’re
pregnant, there is a risk of the baby
getting a severe and potentially
fatal herpes infection, so if you have
active ulcers you need to discuss it
with your midwife or GP
.
Syphilis
Symptoms: It may start with a sore
in the vaginal or anal area, or around
the genitals in men. Once the initial
ulcer heals, it can stay in your sys-
tem for years.
Treatment: Swabs that are usually
used to test for STIs may show noth-
ing, so blood tests are also used in
diagnosing syphilis. Although cases
are rare now, this serious infection
can cause infertility and affect the
heart, blood vessels, skin, bones and
brain if left untreated. The infection
can be treated with antibiotics and,
like other STIs, it is important to
contact and test all sexual partners.
It is important for you to know the
symptoms of STIs and not ignore
them in the hope that they will go
away. If you feel that you may have
contracted an STI or if you would
like a sexual health check-up, you
will need to make an appointment at
your local genito-urinary medicine
(GUM) clinic. To find out where it
is, you can come to the Information
and Advice Centre or phone Sexual
Health Direct on 0845 310 1334.
Alternatively, if you live locally
you can make an appointment at
the Imperial College Health Centre.

No room for your club? Let us know
Room bookings
In reply to last week’s letter from ‘a
disgruntled director’, we apologise
for the problems clubs have been
facing with room bookings in the
Union and College. We realise there
are problems and are working to
rectify them.
With regard to College rooms,
we have been in talks with the
Conference division, who look after
Internal room bookings, to make
them aware of the problems we have
been having and ways in which they
can be avoided in future. We are also
working on a written agreement on
what rights our clubs and societies
have for College rooms, to ensure
that there are clear guidelines. All
the complaints we have had have
been passed on to them and we will
be meeting with them in the com-
ing weeks to see what progress has
been made.
It is important that if you have any
problems you pass on the details on
to myself and our Facilities Manager,
who has direct contact with College
internal bookings and will be liaising
between College and clubs as the
central point of contact, to improve
the process and improve commu-
nication.
We know that problems are occur-
ring, but we need full details if our
argument is to have strong standing
with College. Let us know at dpfs@ic.
ac.uk and facilities@ic.ac.uk.
The College is installing a new
room booking software system,
which has more capabilities and
should reduce problems in the
future.
There have also been difficulties
in the Union, but again only a few
details ever reach us so it is hard
to see where the real problem lies.
Hopefully, after this response, we
will get more information about the
problems. We do realise that there
are issues and are trying to ensure
that we improve the process when
the system is failing the needs of
our clubs.
We have a limited number of
rooms with a very large number
of groups wanting to use them for
meetings, rehearsals and other club
events, therefore bookings can be
difficult to find.
We do also hire out our rooms
to external organisations because
they bring in a large revenue
(approximately £100,000 per year)
which we reinvest into the Union.
We try to ensure these bookings
are at times when our students and
clubs want them least (such as dur-
ing lecture hours and holidays).
Our priority is student club book-
ings, but we need to generate
income which is reinvested into the
Union for maintaining the building
and ultimately funding our student
activities.
Budgeting
If you are on the committee of a
club or society, you will know that
the budgeting process is currently
underway. Over the last few months,
a Budget Review has been undertak-
en, with the feedback from clubs and
societies being conveyed via your
CSC (Club and Society Committee)
or FU (Faculty Union) representa-
tive and improvements made for
this year’s process in response.
The budgeting system for this
year attempts to be fairer and
more flexible. There is much more
club and CSC/FU involvement in
the final allocation. There is only a
finite amount of money (currently
£350,000) that the Union is able to
spend directly on club and society
budgets.
The new method tries to ensure
that the available money will be allo-
cated fairly and in accordance with
the clubs’ needs, thereby allowing
it to be spent effectively rather than
being locked away in areas where
it will never be used. It also tries to
ensure that the clubs and societies
enjoy ownership and involvement
of their budget by allowing them
to decide how to target the money
allocated to them.
So, do think carefully about your
budgets. If you’ve had budget prob-
lems this year, please ensure that
they don’t happen again. For more
information, contact your CSC or
FU representatives.
