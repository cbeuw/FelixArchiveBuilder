Titan, Saturn’s smog shroud-
ed moon, is not giving up its
secrets easily. Last Friday,
after a seven year, two bil-
lion kilometre journey, the
European Space Agency
probe Huygens descended to
the surface of Titan, beam-
ing back pictures and data as
it went. The scientists gath-
ered at mission control in
Darmstadt, Germany, for the
descent were ecstatic with
the success, but are likely to
be puzzling over the results
for years to come.
In the lead up to the land-
ing, some scientists made
bold predictions about the
nature of what would be found
at Titan. John Zarnecki, who
heads the Open University
team that built Hugens’s sur-
face science package, pre-
dicted the presence of weath-
er on Titan with clouds, rain
and even oceans.
“It’s much too cold for a
water based weather system
to exist, but the temperature
is right for simple hydrocar-
bons thought to be present
in the atmosphere, such as
methane and ethane, to cycle
between gas and liquid.”
Last October, infra-red and
radar imaging equipment on
the Saturn orbitor Cassini
penetrated the thick cloud
that surrounds Titan for the
first time, finally revealing
the moon’s surface. But these
images proved to be more
puzzling than informative.
The surface clearly had fea-
tures – light and dark regions
with sharp boundaries – but
what were they? Marty
Tomasko, head of imaging on
the Huygens mission would
not speculate at the time, but
noted that the lack of specu-
lar glare (basically glinting
sunlight), suggested there
was no ocean.
The pictures taken by
Huygens during its descent to
the surface at first seem more
promising. One image, taken
from 16 km above the surface
seems to show streams flow-
ing to a coastline. A pano-
ramic view stitched together
from pictures taken at 8km
is dominated by an almost
featureless dark area dotted
with low clouds, at the edge of
which appears to be a coast-
line. Could this be Zarnecki’s
predicted ocean?
Mission scientists are cau-
tious about such interpreta-
tions. Marty Tomasko notes:
“You have to be careful,
because we’re biased by the
things we see on Earth.”
Tomasko suspects that
Huygens landed in the dark
region. If he is correct then
“sea” may not be the best
analogy for this region.
Under the probe was a
device called a penetrom-
eter, designed to measure
the force of the impact as
Huygens hit the surface at
10 mph. The results beamed
back from this instrument
suggest a hard crust that
cracked on impact to reveal
a soft layer, “something like
crème brulée”, says Andrew
Ball of the Open University,
a colleague of Zarnecki’s on
the Huygens surface science
team. The landing site also
contains scattered small
rocks, possibly of ice, that
appear to be weathered.
WhiletheregionofHuygen’s
landing site does not appear
to be a ‘sea’, it may well
be a reservoir of methane:
Huygens’ mass spectrometer
(chemical analyser) detected
methane evaporating from
Titan’s surface at the landing
site. It also recorded ethane,
acetylene and other complex
hydrocarbon molecules.
The evaporation fits with
Zarnecki’s prediction of a
simple hydrocarbon based
weather system, as does the
presence of low clouds or
ground fog and of stream or
river type features. Unlike
the barren deserts of Mars,
Titan seems to be quite a
dynamic place.
It could be dynamic in other
ways besides having weather.
Many scientists believe that
Titan’s atmosphere – a mix of
Nitrogen and simple hydro-
carbons – is similar to the
present on the early earth.
Perhaps the most scientifi-
cally exciting question for the
Huygens mission is whether
natural chemical processes
on Titan could produce the
complex hydrocarbons that
are the building blocks of life
as we know it. Data from the
mass spectrometer, being
analysed right now, should
be able to tell us the answer
soon.
The surface is too cold for
life as we know it (around
–180ºC), but some scientists,
including Open University
Astrobiologist Barrie Jones,
have speculated that some
form of geothermal energy
on Titan could warm things
up enough for life.
Digital processing more
careful assembly of individual
images into mosaics should
soon give us better pictures
of Titan’s surface. The spec-
tra of light reflected from
surface will give clues more
clues about the chemical
composition of the surface.
One thing is certain, sci-
entists will be analysing
Huygens’ data for years to
come as they try to unlock
Titan’s secrets.

Estonia’s warmest winter
for two centuries has woken
some of its 600 bears several
months early from hiberna-

Friday. The bears’ early reap-
pearance has raised concerns
for the survival of this year’s
cubs. “It has been very warm
and wet and many flooded
rivers have forced bears out
of their dens and out of hiber-
nation,” said a senior official
at the Baltic country’s State
Forest Service.
Controversy over ‘Hobbit man’ discovery
By Sophie Hebden
Science Communication
Last year, an Australian team
of archaeologists discov-
ered a tiny human skeleton
nicknamed ‘the hobbit’ in an
Indonesian cave. But last
week things suddenly turned
sour, when a top expert ques-
tioned the validity of the find-
ings in a national newspaper.
Nature published their
analysis of the 13,000 year old
bones last October, which was
hailed as the most important
discovery in paleoanthropol-
ogy of the last 150 years. The
team claimed that the bones
were that of a new human
species: Homo floresiensis.
They described her as a one
metre tall, 25 year old, intel-
ligent female, descendent of
our long-extinct ancestor. But
in The Guardian last week
critics questioned her sex,
and, most significantly, that
this was not a new species
at all, but a pygmy version
of Homo sapiens with a com-
mon brain disease.
Professor Teuka Jacob from
Gadjah Mada University in
Yogakarta, Indonesia is one of
the world’s most experienced
paleoanthropologists. He told
The Guardian that “There
is plenty of other evidence of
pygmy peoples in the region.
There are pygmies still living
in west Papua, the Andaman
and Nicobar islands, and in
the Philippines. But they are
all Homo sapiens. They’re
just a smaller size. These pyg-
mies were once quite normal
common, but only pockets
remain. There was far more
diversity of people before.”
He explains the unusually
small brain volume of the
skeleton as a result of mental
abnormalities caused by the
disease microcephaly.
But the plot thickens. Jacob
has Flores Hominid locked in
a steel vault. The Australian
co-author of the original
paper, Professor Richard
Roberts, has accused Jacob
of stifling the study by hold-
ing onto the bones. This is an
accusation Jacob vehemently
denies. Co-author Professor
Peter Brown said that Jacob
has a reputation for hold-
ing onto materials and not
allowing other people access.
Jacob rejects these charges
and accuses the Australian
team of unethical behaviour
and inexperience, and says
that the referees of the Nature
article were one-sided.
Cambridge biological
anthropologist Dr Jay Stock
told Felix that the Nature arti-
cle was “rigorously reviewed
by six top palaeontologists.”
He does not think that
Jacob’s accusations stand.
Stock could not confirm the
details of the stand-off over
possession of the bones. He
feels that Jacob’s comments
to The Guardian have dam-
aged the reputation of pal-
aeontology, because his criti-
cisms should have been pub-
lished in an academic journal
where referees can check the
evidence before it is made
public. He continues: “Jacob
does a disservice to human
palaeontology and studies of
human evolution by raising
these disagreements pub-
licly. It undermines the sci-
ence that we agree on.” The
uncertainty over the Flores
Hominid discovery has led
Muslim and Christian crea-
tionists to use Jacob’s com-
ments as evidence against
evolution.
An underlying argument
fuels the dispute: where did
modern Homo sapiens evolve,
in Africa or in a number of
places scattered around the
world? If Homo florensiensis
is another species of human,
it would undermine the multi-
region theory.
Stock told Felix that the
next step is to look at Flores
Hominid’s DNA, to try to
resolve whether it is a new
species of human. He said:
“I’m not sure if samples were
taken before the skeleton was
taken by Jacob. No-one has
reported any DNA results
yet.” This dispute seems far
from resolved.
