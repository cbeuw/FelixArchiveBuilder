If you read the article next to this,
or if you are a fan of dance, you will
have gathered, or in the latter case
already be well aware, that Sadlers
Wells is London’s most exciting
venue for dance.
Sadlers Wells hosts a wide range
of performances ranging from bal-
let, of the avant garde variety or
otherwise, to rather less classical
expressions. They are also a venue
to which visiting opera companies
come.
Many of Matthew Bourne’s rath-
er creative reworkings of classic
ballets are staged at Sadlers Wells
with great regularity. Other Bourne
ballets include Cinderella and The
Nutcracker, which, like Swan Lake,
are well-established and loved clas-
sics. Modern re-workings are not to
everyone’s tastes, but if you’re curi-
ous and don’t want to take yourself
out to Farringdon you can get a good
selection of DVDs of his ballets – you
needn’t leave home as you can order
them via the internet. Or, if you are
feeling energetic, you could go to
see performances of Bourne’s ballet
Highland Fling at the beginning of
March.
Currently, Sadlers Wells is host-
ing the Flamenco Festival London
until Sunday 30 January. This is the
second year in which the festival
has run, and this year you can even
make the most of post-performance
enthusiasm and take part in fla-
menco classes following the show at
Sadlers Wells. During the two-week
duration of the festival, a wide range
of dance troupes and star danc-
ers will be performing traditional,
contemporary and more forward-
looking versions of this iconic dance
form.
A number of companies will be
visiting Sadlers Wells later on this
year, including the Phoenix Dance
Theatre, the Northern Ballet
Theatre and the legendary Sylvie
Guillem with ‘The Ballet Boyz’ (yes,
that is an atrocious name). This year
has already seen highly acclaimed
performances of stark, modern,
somewhat conceptual works by the
San Francisco Ballet.

Wells, go to their website at www.

grammes for the main stage
and the subsidiary stages are
available there, as well as booking
information.

A dear friend decided to treat me
for Christmas by taking me to see
what turned out to be one of the
most exhilarating shows I have ever
watched, and I have watched a good
few!
For a Tchaikovsky fanatic like
me, who is familiar with the music,
Matthew Bourne’s Swan Lake was
deeply touching, and by the end of
the show I was left with an over-
whelming mixture of emotions and
shock. His contemporary take on
the original story is his passport to
freedom to exercise what would nor-
mally be unacceptable in conven-
tional ballet, from the homosexual
nature of the love story to the 21st
century humour and social issues
that amused and thrilled the audi-
ence throughout.
The story revolves around a prince
whose royal lifestyle has left him
with deep complexes about his self-
worth and a craving for love. While
his mother, the Queen, indulges in
the power and vanity that come with
the job to have all pleasures at her
will, he grows up longing for a car-
ing touch that finally seems to be
fulfilled after falling in love with a
swan, who he meets when trying to
take his own life in a lake.
The twists and turns of the story,
though beautifully crafted, leave
the audience with a deep feeling of
shock, as the swan later turns up
at a royal party as a man and tries
to seduce the Queen. The Prince is
devastated and is locked away by
the Queen, as he is thought to be
mentally ill. The swans, which seem
to have been a figment of his imagi-
nation to fill the emotional gaps in
his life, revisit him in the last scene,
their rage ultimately depriving the
lovers of their lives; the Prince is
found dead by his regretful mother
the next day.
The set design and the costumes
were magical, but then again they is
rarely less than perfect on the West
End. What really sets this produc-
tion apart is the dancers’ graceful
ability to evoke very powerful emo-
tions in the audience, and I strongly
recommend everyone to see it at
least once.
Unfortunately the current run has
now ended, so you will have to wait
for another revival. The ballet was
premiered in 1995, so surely a tenth
anniversary run will be in order.

Something of a more traditional
take on Swan Lake, as presented
by the Moscow Ballet. Take note,
here the swan is female
“one of the most
exhilarating shows I
have ever watched”
