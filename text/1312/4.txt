Why did a tsunami that killed
more than 150,000 people
harm no more than a handful
of animals?
Over the last few weeks,
we have been bombarded
with terrible images of chaos,
destruction and death. The
cost in human lives has been
made brutally clear. Yet wild-
life officials in Sri Lanka,
where more than 30,000 peo-
ple have been reported dead
so far, insist that there have
been no recorded animal
deaths. Similar reports are
appearing from other dev-
astated areas and one can-
not help but wonder: where
were they all when disaster
struck?
As anecdotal evidence
emerges of unusual ani-
mal behaviour prior to the
catastrophe, the debate over
whether animals can sense
impending disaster and flee
from it has resurfaced with a
vengeance.
The roots of this debate
stretch back to ancient
Greece. In 373BC, historians
recorded that animals includ-
ing rats, snakes and weasels
deserted the Greek city of
Helice en masse just days
before it was destroyed by
an earthquake and tsunami.
Tales of animal behaviour
that appears to anticipate dis-
aster have surfaced across
the centuries ever since.
In spite of this wealth of
anecdotal evidence, however,
the majority of the scientific
community does not recog-
nise a link between animal
behaviour and earthquakes.
The United States Geological
Survey (USGS) says on its
website:
“Changes in animal behav-
ior cannot be used to predict
earthquakes. Even though
there have been document-
ed cases of unusual animal
behaviorpriortoearthquakes,
a reproducible connection
between a specific behav-
iour and the occurrence of
an earthquake has not been
made.”
In the recent press cover-
age of the Indian Ocean tsu-
nami disaster, Andy Michael,
a geophysicist at USGS, was
quoted as saying: “What
we’re faced with is a lot of
anecdotes. Animals react to
so many things – being hun-
gry, defending their territo-
ries, mating, predators – so
it’s hard to have a controlled
study to get that advanced
warning signal.”
True, but this did not stop
the USGS from attempting
an extensive series of these
studies in the late 1970s.
The trigger for this flurry of
activity was what has prob-
ably become the most famous
example of alleged animal
activity prior to an earth-
quake in modern history.
On 4 February 1975, Chinese
authorities successfully evac-
uated Haicheng, a city with
one million people, just days
before a 7.3-magnitude earth-
quake struck (the Indian
Ocean tsunami was caused
by an 8.9-magnitude earth-
quake). They claimed that
their decision to evacuate
was based in part on observa-
tions of animal behaviour.
The ensuing excitement at
USGS was further boosted in
1977 when researchers found
that 50% of local people sur-
veyed after an earthquake in
California had noticed unu-
sual behaviour in their pets
prior to the event. The impos-
sible suddenly seemed pos-
sible.
But it was followed by dis-
appointment. The California
findings were not deemed to
merit further action and it
emerged that the Chinese
had neglected to mention a
rare series of smaller quakes
that had occurred in the area
before the big one. The USGS
ceased all research into a
possible link between animal
behaviour and earthquakes
in 1980.
China did not, and nor did
Japan. Whether because of
their susceptibility to earth-
quakes or a philosophy that
embraces nature, these two
countries have continued to
research animal behaviour as
a possible earthquake predic-
tion tool. They have had false
alarms, of course, but they
have had successes too.
Continued research in the
Far East led to the headline-
grabbing news in September
2003 that a Japanese medi-
cal doctor had conducted a
study which demonstrated
that erratic behaviour in dogs
could be used to forecast
earthquakes.
The study was contentious
– The Guardian was at pains
to point out that it was “even
being regarded with caution
in Japan” – but its report-
ing here reflects the contin-
ued allure of believing that
animals have some kind of
sixth sense to warn them of
impending danger, even in
the absence of scientific evi-
dence.
The USGS is correct in
saying that “a reproducible
connection between a spe-
cific behaviour and the occur-
rence of an earthquake has
not been made”. However,
just because there is no way
of explaining something does
not mean that something
does not exist. The Chinese
have taken this view in their
construction of a network
of experimental stations to
collect and analyse animal
behaviour observations.
Where Western geologists
and seismologists have been
reluctant to entertain the
notion of animal behaviour
as a predictive tool, biolo-
gists and behaviourists have
proposed various theories
to explain how animals may
sense earthquakes seemingly
before they happen.
Rather than postulating
the existence of a mysterious
sixth sense, the majority of
these theories draw on ani-
mals’ highly evolved existing
sensory apparatus to make
their case. Remember too
that animals respond to each
other: the flight of one may
trigger an exodus.
Earthquakes shake the
ground and one of the most
obvious ways in which ani-
mals could ‘predict’ them is
by picking up advance vibra-
tions that are too small for us
to feel. Many animals, rang-
ing from rodents to elephants,
are known to use shockwaves
in communication.
Joyce Poole, Director
of the Savanna Elephant
Vocalization Project, has
worked with African ele-
phants for 25 years and says
that research on acoustic and
seismic communication indi-
cates that elephants could
easily pick up vibrations gen-
erated from an earthquake-
tsunami. Fellow researcher
Caitlin O’Connell-Rodwell
describes how the soft skin
on the undersides of elephant
feet is comparable to the taut
surface of a drum and is simi-
larly sensitive to the tiniest
vibration.
But even if they can pick
up vibrations that warn them
of impending danger, how do
they know where to run? A
Dutch ethologist, Paul Koene,
explains that elephants
instinctively head for higher
ground when they feel threat-
ened. This fits in well with
anecdotes of Sri Lankan ele-
phants breaking loose for the
hills just before the tsunami
hit.
An alternative theory that
has gained acceptance in
recent years is that animals
pick up on magnetic field
changes that occur near the
epicentre of an earthquake.
Many animals are known to
use the earth’s magnetic field
to navigate, including pigeons
and turtles.
A third hypothesis postu-
lates that it is changes in
electric charges that alert
animals to a quake. Certain
species of fish are known
to be sensitive to variations
in electric fields – the elec-
tric eel is the most obvious
example – and researchers
believe they may pick up on
the electric charge variations
in water that sometimes pre-
cede earthquakes.
On land, organisms may
respond to changes in the
polarity and concentration of
atmospheric ions, or charged
particles. This could allow
animals to detect the air-
ionising effects of radon gas,
which is sometimes released
from the ground before an
earthquake.
A piezoelectric effect has
also been invoked: changes
in the pressure exerted on
crystals like quartz result
in electrical charging of the
crystals’ surfaces. This is
believed to generate enough
electrical energy to drive
the creation of airborne ions
before, during and after an
earthquake. Animals may
anticipate earthquakes much
as they sense oncoming thun-
derstorms.
That organisms should
respond to vibrations, mag-
netism or electrical charges
does not exhaust the range of
theories that advocates of an
earthquake-animal behaviour
link have put forward.
More controversial hypoth-
eses include the idea that
animals react to ultrasound
emitted by fracturing rock
before an earthquake occurs.
This theory has been heavily
criticised by geologists who
claim that no such sound is
emitted.
Yet the most contentious
argument of all remains the
idea that animals do indeed
possess a sixth sense, some-
thing fundamentally different
to the five senses that we cur-
rently recognise. Perhaps ani-
mals perceive and respond to
stimuli that science at present
simply cannot measure.
Here we enter the realm
of biologists like Rupert
Sheldrake, who try to explain
mysteries such as why dogs
sometimes seem to anticipate
the arrival of their owner,
even in the apparent absence
of any physical signals.
Critics will be inclined to
make short thrift of the sixth
sense theory in its most liter-
al form and will point out the
lack of scientific evidence to
support it. Nevertheless, and
here we return to the essence
of the problem, critics and
advocates alike suffer from
the problem of how to con-
duct controlled experiments
to test the earthquake-animal
behaviour hypothesis.
Everyone agrees that there
is an abundance of anecdotes
detailing unusual animal
behaviour prior to earth-
quakes and no one denies
that amazingly few crea-
tures appear to have died in
the wake of the recent tsu-
nami. Yet neither believers
nor sceptics can realistically
confirm or deny a direct link
between animal behaviour
and an impending disaster.
As scientists, we instinc-
tively question and search
for evidence. Perhaps this is
a case where we should fol-
low the East in their simple
acceptance of a natural phe-
nomenon. This does not mean
that we should cease study-
ing how animals may ‘predict’
earthquakes; it means that
we should use their abilities,
even if we do not understand
them, to save human lives
where we can.
The Anthropological Survey
of India’s plan to immedi-
ately document the animal-
based warning systems that
enabled all five aboriginal
tribes inhabiting the badly-hit
Andaman and Nicobar islands
to escape unscathed is a step
in the right direction.

Prescience: do animals have an ability to predict natural disasters and ensure their
survival? Can they be trained to give warnings before earthquakes?
