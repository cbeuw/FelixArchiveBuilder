Are you looking for a job that offers real responsibility with an enormous learning opportunity? If so,
please join us for afternoon coffee and meet ex-interns, junior and senior professionals and find out what
we can offer you over the coming summer.
We look for people who are open minded about work, life and their future in general; who get a buzz out
of approaching problems that bit differently; and who know there’s always something greater to be
achieved. They’re people who stand out in all sorts of ways and, as a result, fit in to CSFB.
You must register for this event by emailing graduate.recruitment@csfb.com no later than Friday
21 January, 17:00.
