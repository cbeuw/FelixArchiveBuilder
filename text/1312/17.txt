At 74, Clint Eastwood has certainly
earned the right to kick back and
take life easy. The fact that he’s
still active and involved in quality
films is definitely the movie-going
public’s gain.
As someone who does not like
films with violence just for the sake
of it, I would probably have avoided
this one if it were not for the stel-
lar cast – and I’m glad that I was
swayed. This is not a film about
boxing; it is a film with boxing in it
that delicately deals with themes of
morality, forgiveness, perseverance
and human relationships without
falling into the Hollywood trap of
labouring the point to hammer the
lessons home. The pace is steady,
but not dull, and the subtlety of the
film makes it a pleasure to watch
rather than the torture of sitting
through a sermon.
If you have not yet seen the film
and don’t know much about it, my
advice is don’t read any further.
Avoid other reviews and the film
synopsis, and just go see it.
Eastwood gives his usual griz-
zled performance as Frankie Dunn,
a trainer who finally has a fighter
with a chance at the championship
title and is adamant that he does
not train girls. Hilary Swank makes
the film her own and is outstanding
as Maggie – white trash who des-
perately wants to make something
of herself through boxing and has
decided that Frankie is the trainer
to get her there. The progression
of their relationship from surly old
man and over-eager wannabe to
gruff but caring trainer and prom-
ising fighter is gently steered by
Scrap (Freeman), a former fighter
who helps out at Frankie’s gym.
The supporting cast does not
let this fantastic trio down: Jay
Baruchel (Danger, the gym’s
dummy) steals every scene he is in
– praise indeed considering the com-
pany he is in – and Brian O’Byrne is
the most ‘human’ Catholic priest
I’ve ever seen, exasperated beyond
patience at Frankie’s deliberate
needling, and refusing to take any
crap. Maggie’s trailer park mother
(Margo Martindale) has to be seen
to be believed.
Eastwood’s direction is beautifully
done, with moody lighting and gritty
images of Frankie’s dingy gym mak-
ing way for brighter and cleaner
shots as the relationships between
the characters, and Maggie’s
dreams, progress. Little finish-
ing touches are everywhere, such
as Maggie’s galloping into every
fight with hedonistic enthusiasm,
Frankie’s small involuntary smile
when she wins her first fight, and
Scrap’s satisfaction at making it to
fight 110.
The script is excellent, with the
griping and bickering between
Frankie and Scrap the highlight. In
fact, it comes so naturally to them
that it seems as if the scriptwrit-
er has documented Eastwood and
Freeman hanging out and having
‘grumpy old men’ conversations.
The only flaw was Frankie teach-
ing himself Gaelic – as a device
for character development it was
unnecessary, and was a jarring note
because of its randomness.
The action scenes are superb, but
not for the squeamish. The choreog-
raphy makes the fights absorbing, so
much so that I found myself twitch-
ing along with Frankie (although
I resisted doing air punches) and
smiling in relief whenever Maggie
won a fight. Frankie’s methods of
stemming the bleeding from cracked
cheekbones and broken noses made
me wince far more than the actual
fighting.
This is a thought-provoking film,
thoroughly deserving of the awards
it has gathered.
It’s a knockout

The ugly stick beat on these two quite heavily
Scorsese’s best shot at an Oscar (again)
They said that Kundun would be a
masterpiece. It wasn’t. They said
that Bringing Back the Dead was
his most powerful film since Taxi
Driver. But it was rubbish. They
said that Gangs of New York was
Martin Scorsese back at his very
best. They couldn’t be more wrong.
It was against this backdrop of
disappointment after disappoint-
ment that I went to see Scorsese’s
biopic of legendary aviator Howard
Hughes.
The Aviator begins with Howard
Hughes (Leonardo Di Caprio), the
son of a wealthy Texan industri-
alist, as director and producer in
Hollywood, making some of the
most influential and ground-break-
ing movies of the 1930s. The film
covers his relationships with some
of the industry’s most beautiful
divas such as Katherine Hepburn
(Kate Blanchett) and Ava Gardner
(Kate Becksindale).
But Howard Hughes was much
more than just a movie-maker. His
most important legacy is to be found
in the aviation industry. Without
Hughes’ innovations in engineering,
commercial air travel may never
have become possible so quickly.
The film also looks at the rivalry
between Hughes’ airline TWA and
that of Pan-Am, which was owned
by his rival Juan Trippe (Alex
Baldwin).
Away from the glamour of Hughes’
playboy Hollywood lifestyle,
Scorsese does not flinch from look-
ing at the darker side of the story
and Hughes’ inner demons, which
drove him to achieve, but were to
eventually destroy him. Hughes suf-
fered from a host of psychologi-
cal neuroses, symptoms of which
included paranoia and obsessive
hand-washing. His problems grew
worse as he grew older, and the
film reflects this (although we are
spared seeing Hughes in his later
years when his condition turned
him into a complete recluse).
Very rarely in American cinema
are American heroes presented in
this way, and credit goes to Leonardo
Di Caprio whose surprisingly excel-
lent performance balances the bipo-
lar nature of Hughes’ character to
Oscar-winning perfection.
The film runs just shy of three
hours and this can be an issue. It
just seemed to repeat itself over and
over again, the standard sequence
being Hughes faced with challenge,
Hughes surmounts challenge ingen-
iously, Hughes confronts psycholog-
ical problem, Hughes faces another
challenge, and so on and so forth.
You feel that the film is not actually
getting anywhere. Thankfully, the
superb cinematography, the trade-
mark Scorsese sweeping camera
movements and the lavish sets com-
pensate greatly for this fault.
Above all The Aviator, similarly
to Forrest Gump, is a promotion of
the American Dream. You leave the
cinema with the feeling “if Hughes
could do it then I can do it”. If
Howard Hughes or Forrest Gump
could change the course of history
and overcome their respective chal-
lenges then anyone can make it
in America. The difference is that
Forrest Gump was an entirely fic-
tionalcharacterandHowardHughes
lived and became the richest man in
the world. The difference is that The
Aviator is not purely an ode to the
American dream, as Forrest Gump
was, but a thoughtful and brilliantly
made reminiscence of America in
its heyday. Darius Nikbin
