Cracking Cryptic Crosswords
Lesson 4. Abbreviations
Abbreviations are often used as building-blocks
for words. Dictionaries may list abbreviations
separately and all common ones are valid in a
cryptic clue. Of course, they will rarely be
written out in full within the clue - that would
be too easy. Instead they will probably be
suggested with a reference to their meaning or
definition.
In the following examples, and indeed in all
cryptic clues, there is no distinction made
between upper- and lower-case letters. The
examples, incidently, serve to show a few
common abbreviations or illustrate the ways in
which an abbreviation might be indicated.
•Common Abbreviations
Single letters
Take the letter P: it can be an abbreviation for
page, penny, pence or quietly (pianissimo)
among other things. U can stand for Universal
(film rating), University, Upper-class etc.
Multiple letters
AC - Alternating Current or account, bill
A M - in the morning, before lunch
B A - Bachelor, scholar, graduate, degree
IVE - I have
NT - New Testament, part of bible, book(s)
R E - With reference to, about, regarding or
Royal Engineers, soldiers etc.
Cracking Cryptic Crosswords
ST - Street, way, road or saint, good man
U N - United Nations, multinational
organisation
US - America, the States
Think of all the abbreviations for a doctor: M D ,
DR, GP, M P , MO...
It's that time again:
1. Let the soldiers take the New Testament (4)
2. In the morning by the states, the English
entertain (5)
3. Test I have to take for a reason (6)
•Compass Points
N - North, Northern, Point, Quarter, Direction,
Bearing, Pole
E - East, Eastern, Point, Quarter, Direction,
Bearing
S - South...
NE, SW etc. are also possible.
4. Information from all quarters (4)
•Chemical Symbols
Common ones are gold (AU) and silver (AG)
but being at Imperial, I would expect you to
know a few more common elements' symbols.
5. Carbon Monoxide and Aluminium make a
goodfuel (4)
•Months / Days
FEB - February, after January etc...
M A R - March
DEC - December, last month
M O N - Monday, before Tuesday

6. Tense was Pascal the second time (4)
•Names
A L - Albert E R - Queen
DI - Diana T E D or E D - Edward
DOT - Dorothy etc...
7. Robert and Edward got dressed (5)
•Roman Numerals
Since they are abbreviations for Latin words, I
can mention them here. They are of course:
I - 1, one, unit L - 50...
V - 5, five, a few, C - 100, many, lots
some D - 500...
X - 10, ten M - 1000...
8. An engineer that adds 104 and 49 (5)
The last two words are built up from dissimilar
abbreviations:
9. March South to the planet (A)
10. Numerous take a degree in New York (4)
