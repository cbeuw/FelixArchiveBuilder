President's Underdevelopment Burglary
mm
The Sherfield Walkway: before and after.
BY MIKE INGRAM
The promised development of retail
premises on the Sherfield walkway
(Felix 979) has been delayed.
The plans to improve services on
the walkway were approved by the
Management Planning Committee
(the top advisory body at Imperial
College) last term. Union President,
Andrew Wensley, speaking to
Felix, had estimated that the plans
would be ready after Christmas. He
has now said that the plans will be
finished by the end of March.
According to M r Wensley, the
delay is due to "clarification on
issues such as fire regulations". He
said that the development is now
being handled between the Union
and the College Estates division.
Investigations are also being
made into the disappearance of
posters from the walkway.
Several groups, including the
City and Guilds College Union
(C&GCU), complained at the last
Union Executive meeting that
posters they had placed on the
noticeboards along the walkway
had been removed.
It was suggested that the posters

had been deliberately removed, but
it is possible that they had merely
been blown down by the wind and
cleared up. Charles Leary, Deputy
President (Clubs and Societies)
commented: " I C U is aware that
certain posters have been taken
down and we will be investigating."
The Union would like to point
out that the chocolate machine in
the foyer of the Union Building
now charges 25p for each bar of
chocolate. The refilling of the
machine has been taken over by the
Union, so it will also be restocked
more frequently.
Colleges To Enter Stock Market
BY MIKE INGRAM
The Committee of Vice Chancellors
and Principals (CVCP) has revealed
plans for universities to enter the
stock market in order to raise extra
income. A group of approximately
ten universities is heading the
scheme which would involve
setting up a financial consortium to
deal with investments. Institutions
would guarantee these investments
with their property (including
campuses).
A financial adviser has been
appointed to produce the detailed
plans for the scheme, which has
been approved by both the
Department for Education and the
Higher Education Funding Council.
A spokesman for the C V C P
commented: "The new company
will employ people who know what
they are doing, rather than dabbling
in an amateurish way. Universities
would have to put up money to
become shareholders. It is a form of
privatisation.
"The function [of the company]
would be to enable universities and
other higher education institutions
to raise funds from the capital
markets.
"The blueprint may well give
rise to a need to re-examine the
Treasury's restrictions on univer-
sities' powers to borrow against
their assets."
Universities have set up an
advisory group to take care of the
scheme, chaired by Sir William
Fraser, the principal of Glasgow
University. The group also includes
representatives from the Depart-
ment of Education.
Imperial College is, as yet, not
directly involved in the scheme.

The College Conference Office in
Southside suffered a burglary over
the weekend.
The break-in, discovered on
Monday morning, involved the
theft of equipment worth over
Â£3,500, including fax machines and
a laser printer. The office appears
to have been entered by the
removal of a small panel of glass in
the door (allowing access to the
lock). The burglars left no sign of
entry on the outside of the building.
College Security are requesting
anyone who has seen anything
suspicious in the Southside area to
contact them. They can be found in
the entrances of most departments.
Along with other incidents, the
burglary has prompted a fresh
campaign to cut down on easy
targets for theft. From now on,
Security will regularly be checking
for unlocked and unattended
rooms; those found will be logged.
A reminder to lock the room will
also be left.
The thefts have also raised the
possibility of College making it
compulsory to wear swipe cards in
the College grounds. Security are
recommending that people wear
their cards around College to help
combat petty crime.
Outlook
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Employment prospects are on the
up for this years graduates, accord-
ing to a report by Incomes Data
Services (IDS). The document,
printed this week, estimated that
employers will increase their
recruitment of graduates by 16
percent this year.
The IDS also claim that salaries
for recently recruited graduates are
increasing by more than ten per
cent, compared with rises of the
rest of the workforce of about two
per cent.
The reasons given by employers
for the upturn forecast in the
demand for graduates is an
increased economic confidence and
a belief that the worst of the job-
cutting exercises are over.
However, the report cautions
against "over-optimism", arguing
that most employers are simply
returning to 1992 levels of
recruitment.
Deadline for Access Fund applications is 25th February
