¥ To my love,
DECLARATION
We shared a life of fantasy
And loved each other endlessly.
Our hearts would beat with
passionate haste;
No time to spare, not a second
to waste!
For life was short, I knew it well;
A story I could rarely tell.
'Tomorrow is another day!'
Those were words I'd seldom
say.
Clinging moments spent
together. Words of love he sent
through whispers only I could
hear.
The one I cherish, a man so dear!
How gently he took care of me
Enveloped in such ecstasy!
He offered me his thoughts, his
heart!
Oh! Why must I so soon depart
And here, alone, my loved-one
leave
Incapable my thanks to receive?
The one last breath I kept for
him,
Though light outside began to
dim
A tears invade my dying eyes,
Was to declare 'love never
dies'.
I miss you K
<? To Matt & Percy.
We all love you at this college.
All the women (who are fit).
¥ Nelly, I'm afraid it just has to
be said that you have simply
T H E most beautiful ebony
eyes...they melt me. Find me
before it's too late (i.e. April)!
With distant affection. Sam
(with no 'N')
V John,
I love you! Your my fluffy little
snugglebum. Lets get married.
Luv Julliet.
