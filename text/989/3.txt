Application forms for the second
round of Access Funds requests are
now available from the College
Fees Office, room 334, Sherfield

The funds are made available by
the Government to help students
suffering serious financial hardship.
Potential applicants are invited
to collect and complete a form. The
forms must be returned to the Fees
Office before 25th February.
Students who have received
assistance from Access Funds in a
previous round of applications are
not automatically disbarred from
applying again. However, previous
applications will be borne in mind
when the assessments are made.
Please ensure that you collect
and return your form in good time
since it will not be possible to
accept late applications.
Thieves Target Southwell Hall
BY SHAUN JOYNSON
Imperial College students have been
warned to be on their guard after
walk-in thieves stole property from
Southwell Hall in two separate
incidents in the last month.
In the first, a wallet was stolen
from a room. A man was later
arrested in Hackney in connection
with the theft. Two weeks later a
hi-fi unit was stolen from the room
of another student.
College Security believe that the
thieves gained access to the Hall by
following students as they entered
the building using their magnetic
keys.
Following these incidents,
Southwell Hall's Warden, K e n
Young, has called for students to be
more vigilant in checking the
credentials of visitors.
In another incident, a female
student was woken up at night by
the sound of someone trying her
door. When she investigated, she
found a man outside who claimed to
be looking for a friend who lived
there. He left the building shortly
afterwards.
Though thieves have only struck
twice, it is thought that they are
choosing halls of residence because
they regard them as an easy target.
Term Time Jobs Affect Courses
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Taking on part-time work could
seriously affect your degree,
according to officials. Vice Chan-
cellors are launching a nationwide
survey to uncover the extent of
student poverty and the numbers
working part-time during term.
With the basic student grant
currently remaining frozen at the
1990 levels students are being
forced to take on Saturday and
evening jobs to pay rent and living
expenses.
Ted Neild, spokesman for the
Committee of Vice Chancellors and
Principals commented: "It cannot
be beneficial for students to work
part-time when they should be
studying. They should not have to
do that."
A number of Oxbridge colleges
have already recognised the prob-
lem as serious and banned students
from taking on part-time work
during term-time. Some are even
sending out letters to parents
requesting that students do not
undertake employment during the
Christmas and Easter vacations.
A speech made by Liberal
Democrat peer Conrad Russell in
the House of Lords last week
highlighted students' plight. Lord
Russell, Professor of History at
King's College, London, said that
the inadequacy of Government
support for students meant there
had been a rush into paid employ-
ment. He also commented that it
was doing "a great deal of harm" to
the quality of higher education.
