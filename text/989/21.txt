I see cream eggs are back in the shops again.
Every Easter they make a comeback with their
'How Do You Eat Yours?' advertising cam-
paign. How many different ways are there to eat
an egg-shaped lump of chocolate with some odd
sticky goo inside it? Answers on a postcard to....
There is only person I know who eats them
any different to anyone else and he eats them
upside down. I don't mean that he turns the egg
the other way up; he actually turns himself the
other way up. He refuses to eat them any other
way. Strange man!!
One thing that has always puzzled me about
cream eggs is how do they get the yellow
coloured bit of goo inside the white bit of goo?
It's a bit like how they get toothpaste to come
out of a tube in stripes. One of life's great
mysteries, I suppose.

Was it Play School that used to show that sort
of thing? There used to be a two or three minute
clip of how something was made in a factory.
The best bit if you ask me! And why did they
take Play School off, only to replace it with Play
Bus or something. Play School was much better.
At least they are still showing Sesame Street!
But going back to those wonders of the
modern world - cream eggs. Does anyone else
besides me try to get the wrapper off in one
piece without ripping it? Not an easy task, I can
tell you. It's a bit like trying to take the lid off a
yoghurt pot without tearing it or peeling an
orange in one go. It's silly how these things
become almost an obsession. Why? It's not as if
anything depended on it. But I'll do it every
time.
