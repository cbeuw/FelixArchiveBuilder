A Terrible Beauty is Born
The world is full of
beautiful things and
riddled with terrible
things and the Phoenix
is a thing of terrible
beauty. Once a year our
own Phoenix rises from
the white hot flames of
test tubes, superstrings
and the intertwined
strands of deoxyribo-
nucleic acid which
make up our Imperial
living. Together we can
fly, laugh, love, dance
and live again...
...I refer to the annual art magazine of Imperial
College of Science, Technology and Medicine.
With C P . Snow's ghost still weeping quietly
into his ale, the time has come for scientists,
engineers and doctors to stand up tall and think
big. For Phoenix is an opportunity for us all to
advance over the divide of Science and Art.
So to business. We've got work to do. This
year's Phoenix will be organised under five
chapter headings which will ostensibly follow
the life of a Phoenix. Starting with birth and
growth, then maturity, onto the decline of years
and penultimately to death. Yet the pedigree of
the Phoenix is that it is reborn from the flames of
its death to new life. And so we finish with the
last chapter heading, rebirth. The idea is that
contributors can work around this skeleton plan
and together we can build a perfect, well
rounded beast that will be the envy of the world.
In previous years the predominance of work
has been poetry and short pieces of prose but the
stage is open for your choice. Photographs,
drawings, graphics, play scripts, whatever, will
be welcome. We especially need artists to design
frontispieces, covers and chapter headings. We
don't really want long stories, though, but come
and talk to us if you are feeling Tolstoic.
The twin-headed editorship this year consists
of Owain Bennallack and Jon Jordan. Please
come over to the Felix Office and rattle our
cages, discuss schemes and plan marvellous
ma azines. We are usually resident during
lunchtimes, so don't delay. There is also a
pigeonhole in Felix for you to drop things into
and Owain can be reached on email:
ojb@ic.doc.uk. The deadline for work will be
the end of this term and the proposed publi-
cation date will be early in the summer.
We shall see you soon.
