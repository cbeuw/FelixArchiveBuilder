Club Update
The following months will see a lot of activity
for the Windsurfing Club. As well as running
trips to Queen Mary Reservoir every
Wednesday afternoon, we are also planning
three longer trips.
The first of these will be to Gosport on the
South Coast from 18th to 20th February. As
well as being a club trip for all standards of
sailor, this will also be the location for trials
from the U L U windsurfing team. This team is
being set up to take part in the first ever
ULU/Oxbridge Challenge at Datchett.
The next trip for the club will be a week long
trip to Penzance over the Easter holidays, from
30th March to 6th April.
Soon after returning from that trip, we will
be going to Clacton to take part in the second
Student National Windsurfing Championships
from 29th April to 2nd May, the Bank Holiday
weekend. This event is again being sponsored
by Bic Sport UK, who are providing a selection
of their new kit to try out.
If you would like any information about
these trips, or any details about the club, please
come along to our next meeting on Tuesday at
1.00pm in Southside Upper Lounge and we will
be happy to help you out.
Bruno Interviewed on STOIC
Frank Bruno was interviewed last weekend by
the Student Television of Imperial College at his
training camp in Leicester. Frank gives his
views on every thing from pantomime to sex.
This will be the first programme in a series
called "Simon Says" based around the workings
of a television studio with a guest star in each
programme. A parallel series of interviews is
also being run on a more serious note by Carlo
Massarella. The first in the series was filmed last
week with "Blockbusters" star, Bob Holness. A
season of films is also about to start on STOIC.
This is a collection of films made by London
students with a wide variety of themes including
gangster and horror.
STOIC is about to go back on air to the
college halls of residence after rebuilding the
studio. If you cannot wait then just watch in Da
Vinci's bar during the day or evening. If there is
a particular programme you want to watch then
please ring on (0)3518 or visit the studio on the
top floor of the Union Building.
On Their Way To Motspur?!
IC lsts 4 - Goldsmiths 0
Having already beaten two of the top three
teams in the last couple of weeks, IC were full
of confidence as they faced the remaining top
team, Goldsmiths. They then proceeded to
expose Goldies inadequacy and give them a
lesson in football unseen since Tottenham 1981.
The defence was a picture of stability and keeper
Mark Nally's most difficult moment was dealing
with a dangerous Rob Williams back pass.
Within minutes, good work down the right
led to the ball ending up at the feet of American
Ian Palmer. The debut-boy walloped it past the
Goldsmiths' goalkeeper. Soon after kickoff, IC
were awarded a free kick, which Richie Dixon
took. He scuffed his shot and the ball ballooned
onto the head of the left back/centre forward
Ben Willis making the score 2-0. Ian Palmer
scored a scrappy goal, but it was not until the
second half, that IC scored what has to be
considered the goal of the season. The ball was
swept around the defence, until Dixon played a
peach of a ball to Tellis Botzios, who flicked it
into the path of the Owambala, who headed into
the top corner with great aplomb.
Alex de Stefano, in his winger-role, took the
piss out of several defenders, then went back
and did it again and again. The final whistle
saved Goldsmiths' agony and IC were honour-
able in victory. A spokesman for the team said:
"It was a game of two halves, both dominated by
IC and we're over the moon, John."
IC next face Kings in the semi-final of the
cup and having annihilated them once in the
league are confident of reaching the finals. IC
are on the way to Motspur...!
