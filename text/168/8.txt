DRAW WITH UNIVERSITY CONQUERORS
Last year's defeat by King's in the
U. L. Cup was avenged at Harlington
on November 8th when we reversed last year's
result with our usual 1-0 win It is remarkable
thing, but out of our seven wins to date five
have been by the) only goal of the match,
unfortunately the Cup Match was no credit
to anyone, except in the very good spirit which
prevailed throughout. Panesar scored our goal
midway through the first half after I C . had
looked like scoring on several occasions, and
then the game deteriorated into a dour strug-
gle with the defences holding out admirably,
but with no constructive attacks from either
side. In a friendly match the following week
we again beat King's by the only goal.
In the second round of the Cup we meet
Q.M.C, and should we bo successful our op-
ponents in the semi-final will be Battersea or
L.S.E., perhaps the biggest danger in the com-
tition.
Our latest success has been a 2-2 draw with
Staines, who had previously beaten the Uni-
versity, and we felt the result was most satis-
factory. The game was the most exciting
and against the best opposition that we have
encountered this season. I.C. were on top for
the first ten minutes and Panesar put us a-
head with a fine opportunist's goal. However,
Staines took control after that and scored twice
before the interval. The second half was very
tense, with good hockey coming from both
sides, and towards the end I.C. had the edge
and drew level ten minutes from the end
with fine goal from Panesar.
The first XI's record reads:

BOXING CLUB
The Boxing Club nas resumed its training ses-
sions for the season. These are held every Fri-
day at 5.00 p.m. Beginners are especialy wel-
come. In the past the College has won die
University Championships several times and
ff it wishes to retain its record, which has
dropped in recent years, more people are
needed to come along and train on Fridays.
The Club runs the Rector's Cup every year,
which is a Tournament between the three
constituent colleges, a cup being) presented to
• the winner. In addition, it'is hoped to-
hold
bouts with other colleges during the year. Any-
one interested should contact M . Harris,
through the Union Rack. No experience is
necessary.
A fairly high standard can be reached in
the three years here; Graham Yorke (last
year's Captain), for example, won the U.A.U.
Championship at his weight, having started
from scratch at^College.

ATHLETICS
The U.L. Winter Relays and Field Events
Competition, in which 13 colleges took part
was held on Wednesday 15th Nov. at Mot-
spur Park. The College team performed well
to retain the "University College Relay Cup"
and they improved upon last years 3rd. pos-
ition to finish 2nd in the field events.
Results:
Relays:
- lst l.C. — 11 pts.
2nd L.S.E. — 10 pts
3rd Westminster — 8 pts.
Field Events:
lst St. Mary's H. 26 pts.
2nd I.C. 16 pts.
U.C. 16 pts.
Westminster H. 16 pts.
All hopes of winning the relays were aband
oned after a stratch 4x 110 yds. team were
beaten into 5th place in the first heat. Jim
Harrison then appeared "hot-Foot" upon the
scene, after swallowing a bar of chocolate,
ran a magnificent 220 leg of the medley relay
(220-440) to give our team the fastest heat
time of 40.6 sees. In the final John Wood
ran probably his fastest race ever in the 440
leg and after leading for the whole lap was just
passed by Griffiths of Westminster H. 2 yds.
before the post! Our time was I m. 38.6
sees.
After Linkleter had run the first half-mile
stage of the middle distance relay (880-880-
1 mile) in 2 m. 6.8 sees, and Clifton the
second stage in an excellent time of 1 m. 58.6
sees. John Cleator started the final mile stage
ered that we had to beat L.S.E. in this race to
just before M. Heck of L.S.E. We then discov-
win the relay Cup, Cleator stayed with the
L.S.E man to the last 880 yds. when he opened
up a 70 yds. gap and stode home an easy win-
ner with a time of 4 m. 25.6 sees, for the
mile stage.
St. Mary's H. with three internationals in
their team were firm favourites for the field
events Cup. However, several of our fresher!
performed better than was expected ajad the
whole team put on a line display. S. Pearson
(151 ft) and C. Whiddett (135 ft) gave us
an aggregate 2nd position in the Javelin. W.
Creed (19 ft. 1 in.) and Harrison (19 ft Hin.)
placed us 4th in the long jump, whilst J- Har-
rison leaded 41 ft. 7 in. and R. Gordon 39
ft 7 in. to gain 4th place in the triple jump.
