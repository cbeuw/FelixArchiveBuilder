- 2 — FELIX
Lord Mayors Show
The wet windy and cold November morn-
ing was not sufficient to deter about 50 Guilds-
men (and women), from giving the President
a great send off in Bo from outside the Guilds
Entrance. They then proceeded to Ludgate Hill
only to find waitingl for them a dozen or so
of the toughest Blues in London. The Guilds-
men were honoured by the reception comit-
tee . . . the police were not amused.
The Blues' Inspector came and chatted to
the President and was heard to remark "You
play ball wiv' me and I'll play ball wiv' you."
The President explained that had the Guilds-
men known beforehand of the City of Lon-
don Police's interesting hobby they would
have brought along their ball of Putney fame.
He then added that if perhaps the Inspector
had any nuts he wanted tightened, the Guilds-
men would be delightful to do the job for
him with the Spanner . . . The Inspector
was amused.
Whilst waiting for the procession the
Guildsmen entertained the crowd with a vast
repertoire of songs, every other being a Boom-
alaka, until the President was seen to wilt
under the strain, at which point the lads re-
sorted to singing songs about Kings in the
Strand . . . The crowd was amused . . . The
police were not amused . . .
A quick whip-round the crowd produced
enough to buy a few dozen poppies which
were diplomatically distributed among the
contributors; the few poppies left over were
ceremoniously presented to the Blues • . . The
Blues were not amused . . .
Among their many "appreciative" com-
ments on the parade, the Guildsmen sang
a complimentary song to an R A F officer on
one of floats about his being beautiful, to
which he replied with a salute which started
and ended at hip level . . The Guildsmen
were amused.
S T U D E N T S S U R V E Y A T I.C.
A week ago last Monday every other malt
and every female third year student in the
College reiceved a copy of the quastionaire
which the Students' Survey Unit is sending out
as part of its Survey. The questionaire is ex-
tremely comprehensive, inquiring into the stud-
ent's background (e.g. parental income, parents'
profession, school attended, etc.), his religious
and political outlook, the papers he reads
and the type of job he intends to take.
The only other student surveys of this type
have been carried out at Oxford and Cam-
bridge and it is hoped to obtain interesting
comparisons between London and Oxbridge
students. The>>results of the survey will also
be submitted as a memorandum to the Rob-
bin's Committee.
The survey* is organised by a group of
students at L.S.E. and the results will be com-
puted by Dr. Mark Abrams, a leading socio-
logist and managing director of Research
Services.

Jock Henry, the College Security Officer,
informs us that he has a considerable quanti-
ty of lost property in his office, including sev-
eral College scarves, ladies' and gents' um-
brellas, gloves, a cardigan and a cap. Jock is
always ready to help students who have lost
anything and can save you considerable effort
in your searchings. His office is just behind
the Messengers' Office in the Beit Building.
From the last issue of King's News: "The
procession was assisted on its way by some
Rugby players, including Kingismen, and these
were met with loud cheers on coming to the
waiting King's party . . . "
There were no Kingsmen among the Rugby
players (apparently it was too cold and wet
for them) and they were boed heartily by the
King's spectators. So much for King's News.
The highlight of the procession for the
Guildsmen was the Guilds rugger team tak-
ing part in the float entitled "Relaxation and
Recreation". Guilds was to have played a-
gainst a Kings team, but apparently it was
too wet and cold for Kings since they did
not turn up . . . the two Guildsmen playing
stand-offs were disappointed . . . and having
heard of Kings in the Strand, so were the
Blues . . • The team scrummed down and the
combined Boomalaka which resounded was
sufficient to completely drown the following
band trying its best to dodge the shower of'
pennies lobbed at the euphonium. The Guilds-
men lost the ball under the float, and the
police, quick to practise their hobby, soon
retrieved it for them!
As the Lord Mayor's coach passed by, the
Spanner was lifted aloft amidst cheers and
such comments as "And in this coach, Ladies
and Gentlemen, we have the Lord Mayor . . ."
The Lord Mayor laughed doffed his hat and
waved . . . Apparently the Lord Mayor was
amused.
After the procession, Bo with the President
and Spanner aboard, set off at walking pace (?)
and was escorted by the Guildsmen as far as
Westminster. The Spanner was shown to
Kings but throughout the mornjlng Reggie
was nowhere to be seen. The Guildsmen were
disappointed . . . the police were relieved.

I.C. T A K E O V E R PROPOSITION
IN U . L . U . D E B A T E
Last Thursday, Nov. 16th, I.C. practically
took over the proposition in the University of
London Union Debate, that in the opinion of
this house "The message of Christianity is ir-
relevant to the X X t h Century." Finlay Mc-
Pherson was the opening guest speaker, Pro-
fessor Emeritus Hyman Levy (who has been
Dean of R.C.S. and retired as head of the
Maths. Dept. just over 3 years ago), was the
principal speaker fof the ]mc*ioni. Donald
Pearson (who is also Chairman of the U . L .
Humanist Society), Dick Lewis (President of
the I.C. Debating Society) and M r . Siimwa-
son all spoke from the floor. Brian Ford of
the I.C. Methodist Society was the only man
from I.C. to oppose the motion, but though
all I.C- members waxed eloquent, the motion
was lost by almost 3:1.
The Debate was of a high standard and is
a good example of the activities at U . L . U .
which are well worth attending.
