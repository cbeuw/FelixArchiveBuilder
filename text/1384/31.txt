Virgo
An astounding
thought will pop
into your brain at
around lunchtime
on Monday. You will
be unable to sup-
press the giddy feeling that you’re soon going
to be emotionally elevated to heights you’ve
never before dreamed of being able to reach.
Then you will realise you are still in bed and
its Monday and you have a 9am lecture. Shit.
Scorpio
On Sunday you will
wake to discover
that you have no
memory of the night
before and your
head is pounding
like an angry gorilla is trying to get out. Also
you are covered in cuts. This is because you
will fall down the escalator in South Ken tube
whilst blathered. Or maybe its because you
will be abducted by aliens. Wait and see!
Libra
As a libran you like
walking around
naked, irrespective
of your other flat-
mates views. Librans
are also violently
opposed to curtains, believing that they are re-
ponsible for global warming. Apparently 88%
of all librans have been arrested for “indecent
exposure” and “gross curtain negligance”.
Sagittarius
You will go camping
in the next week.
Whilst walking
through bracken
with shorts on, you
will get a tick on
your dick. This will preclude all sexual activity
for the rest of your life, or until your grand-
mother removes it for you (the tick that it, not
your dick!). Watch out for the number 59, it
will come to haunt you. Also avoid the letter P.
Capricorn
Absolutely nothing
is going to happen
in the next week to
all capricorns. In
fact you may as well
stay in bed, as all
your lectures will be cancelled, and one twelfth
of the world will hiberate. In fact the next
thing of note will be on Friday when you read
your horoscope again.
Cancer
On your way to
college you will
be accosted by a
Mrmoose. This is a
male moose or elk.
A female moose is,
of course, a moosesse. They like ice-skating,
knitting and have aversions to punting. Never
insult a pregnant moosesse, it may be the last
thing you ever do. You have been warned.
Gemini
You will be
diagnosed this
week with a rare
and fatal condition
- lackalovitis, in
which the infected
patient slowly deteriorates in health due to a
lack of sweet loving. Unfortunately this disease
is rampant in some departments, especially
computing and physics. Only one cure is
known, and you have to pay for it.
Leo
You will discover the
Theory of Quantum
Fetish Mechanics.
This is a rule which
states that any con-
ceivable fetish which
can be invented or conceived already exists
on the Internet, and may have been brought
into existence simply by thinking of it. So get
thinking and invent some new fetishes. Here’s
one to start you off: elderly clown S&M.
Taurus
Taurean Boys: A girl
will refer to you as
a daffodil puncher.
This means that you
can not probably
satisfy a woman via
the great art of fingering. They poke harshly
rather than gently massaging.
Taurean Girls: Watch out for daffodil punch-
ers, especially the Rugby team. They get
everywhere, except to the point...
Aries
This week one
morning you will
awake to discover
a grundfuttock
outside your bed-
room window. A
grundfuttock is a large group of naked angry
dwarves weilding oddly shaped hammers
wearing cock rings. Close the curtains and run
before they pin you down...
Pisces
You will go on safari
in the near future
with your parents.
On returning one
night to your lodge
you will have to
walk through an animal enclosure. A panda
will attack you. You won’t make it to the lodge
and mummy and daddy will put you in their
Renault Megane to take away and dispose of
later on when no ones looking...

Wordoku is identical to sudoku;
we’ve just replaced the numbers
with letters. Once you’ve
completed the puzzle, there
is a hidden word or phrase to
find. Email in your answers to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
The winner of the Wordoku
1,383 was Dave Man.
The hidden phrase was
“QUORNMEAT”.

Slitherlink 1,384
Aquarius
You will rediscover
your childhood pet
guinea pig which
you have forgotten
about. It is still
alive (barely). It’ll
tell you that its leg hurts, and then give
birth to seventeen piglets. At this point you
will realise that the anti-psychotic pills the
doctor gave you aren’t working and that
you have just birthed a fridge.
How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar
to Minesweeper mixed with a dash of
Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw
lines between the dots to create one
long, and most importantly, looping
line. It should have no start or finish;
just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many
lines should be drawn around it, for
example:
Cells which don’t contain a number
can be surrounded by any number of
lines.
Remember, the line must form a
loop, so the line cannot branch. The
following situations are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There
are never cells containing the number
4 in Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most
common place to start on a Slitherlink
grid is by drawing crosses around any
zeros. Drawing crosses is purely done
to so that you know where there can’t
possibly be a line. So, take the pattern
below as an example. Begin by drawing
crosses, then by filling in some lines:
Now the lines can only continue in the
following directions:
The Slitherlinks on this page are basic
5x5 grids. Get practising because you
can expect some 10x10s later in the
term and perhaps even some severe
25x30 grids when we’re feeling really
mean. Email us to let us know how you
got on with these ones.
This final paragraph is a tricky one.
There are four lines to be filled. Did
you know that a blue whale has a 9ft
long penis which is 1ft in diameter?
