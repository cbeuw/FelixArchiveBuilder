his week in ‘Student Art
in Focus’ (or SAIF as we
call it on the street) we
have had the privilege to
have been donated this
fantastic, multimedia creation by a
member of the Faculty of Physical Sci-
ences. The Artist, who prefers to re-
main unnamed, is rumoured to have
created this masterpiece whilst in a fit
of rage after losing a long
‘Battleships’ game to a
computer.
Needless to say
this picture
gives me

Back to School – Jane Eyre
F
rankly, it is without a doubt,
a work of pure quality. I re-
member reading it in class
wayback in Year 7. Such a
long time ago. This was the
first time that I had properly started to
delve into the classics. From then on,
Jane Eyre has been the epitome of fe-
male strength and morality. A heroine
that has captured the hearts of many
generations. It’s an epic romance that
is laced with mystery, suspense and
drama. Set in England in the 1800s,
surely Bronte paints a sublimely realis-
tic portrayal of the time period and the
style of living back in those
olden days.
From the narrative point
of view, I would say that it
is eminently personal and
eloquent. The first per-
son narrative gives such a
breathtakingly wonderful
way of connecting with the
reader. You certainly feel
as though Jane is a living,
breathing entity. Bronte’s
sophistication allows Jane
to present a shrewd, al-
most autobiographical, account of her
life, from inauspicious terrible begin-
nings as an unloved orphan living in
deplorable state to a compromised cli-
matic resolved ending.
We, as the reader, feel distinct pain
and loneliness as the protagonist’s
childhood living with her aunt and
cousins in Gateshead encompasses
being confined to sheer torture, both
physical and mental, and is not nur-
turing to say the least. I really enjoyed
how Bronte seemed to weave every-
thing together in the progression from
childhood to adulthood, from Gates-
head, Lowood to Thornfield Hall, and
it is told in exquisitely powerful verse.
One seems to gain strength as Jane
ache. The artist is trying to tell us
so much and ram heaps of symbol-
ism and metaphor into our lowly
heads that we as common people
cannot look at it without cringing
and trying to turn away in anguish.
So much so that when the piece
was exhibited in its full size (25m x
52m) in the Tate Modern, the room
was rarely populated at all. Howev-
er I have taken several Ibuprofens
in preparation and am ready to un-
twine his train of thought.
The obvious theme of this piece is
premature ejaculation while more
discreet undercurrents of inva-
sion and illness are present. The
red rectangular ‘beasts’ are clearly
homing in on the indistinct shape
in the centre. Vulnerable and alone,
the attackers rip and tear at the
perfect body, distorting its limbs
and ruining its symmetry. This has
blatant parallels with the paparazzi
and Jodie Marsh, but could also be
a satire on the theme of Christmas
shopping. Crazed shoppers rush
towards the displays of organic
turkeys and rip them apart in des-
peration. Fillets may fly.
But what of the mystery shape that
is appearing at the top right of the
picture? Is it the cure (no, not the
band, you fuckwit)? Is it a garden
gnome’s falling from the meta-
phorical sky? Or is it the next piece
of revolutionary art by The Artist
waiting to outwit this one and its
critics? He certainly keeps us hang-
ing onto the edge of our seats and
I, for one, can’t wait for the next
instalment.

Dr. T Pee looking hawt. Money can’t buy caps that stylish
leaps from an insecure, pained young
girl to maturity where she develops her
own sense of inner strength that is pal-
pable when facing times of adversity
and uncertainty.
The repertoire of fascinating char-
acters is indeed compelling, with Ed-
ward Rochester (Jane’s love interest)
definitely being on the same scale as
Mr Darcy, as many Austen fans would
agree; both dark, brooding, handsome
and difficult to win over. The mystery
with Grace Poole is something that
further grips the reader as we work our
way through the novel, finding out who
she really is and getting to the bottom
of her parlous and devious nature.
This intricate love story
is profoundly overwhelm-
ing yet highly complex in
the context of the plot.
Clearly, the attraction be-
tween Jane and Mr. Ro-
chester is evident from the
moment she meets him on
the hill at sunset, their love
subsequently burgeons into
an intrinsically passionate
canon.
To some, the ending is
unassailably a compro-
mised happy conclusion, whereas oth-
ers would still consider it being slightly
tragic. It’s up to you how you inter-
pret the denouement. I shall not give
it away, but this masterpiece will have
you reading until you drop and get to
the finishing line.
This book is without a question a
timeless treasure and a captivating
page-turner. My feelings then and now
are still the same. Jane, for me, certain-
ly symbolises the yearning desire for
happiness in all of us and the vulner-
ability and strength that we are prone
to exhibit most of our lives. I’ll dish
out 9.9 out of 10, marred only by the
intense anticipation for the reunion of
the predestined soul-mates.
