Money, money, money
Trading loses 85k, whilst the Union’s wallet fattens up overall
Matty Hoban
After labouring through the most te-
dious of all tedious documents, Felix
is here to tell you about money; more
specifically, the Union’s money. On
12th October, the report on the Un-
ion’s finances for the year ended 31st
July 2007 was released by the Union
Exec (Executive Committee, ie: the big
dawgs who oversee the running of the
Union). The report gave out a bit of a
mixed message where it indicated that
overall Union surplus income (dollar
left in your wallet after paying your
bills) was £38,715; up from the previ-
ous year (£13,372). However, expendi-
ture was also up with Union trading
(including the bars, the shop and ents)
finishing around £85,000 down.
If you are still interested, or even
outraged at such a loss then I will
continue.
The Union trading loss (compared to
the previous year’s surplus of £166,963)
could be partially explained by man-
agement restructuring and staff costs
which were well up from the previous
year. There were also reduced sales
possibly due to continued building
work on the Beit redevelopment. The
biggest loss makers last year were the
bars (due to the aforementioned staff
costs) and ents; the latter along with
the Union Shop have made a loss in the
last year two years. Also some of the
bigger earners for the Union, such as
the room lettings were down last year,
which did not help plug the gap from
the trading losses. Another dispirit-
ing kick in the coffers came from an
increase in clubs and societies spend-
ing (how dare they spend more money
on their so-called ‘social gatherings’)
and an increase in irrecoverable VAT
(since the Union can claim VAT back,
this reduces expenditure but if it is ir-
recoverable, then say bye to your new
gold-plated toilet-brush).
Okay, I can hear you hollering at me,
wanting me to explain how the Union
actually made a profit after all this talk
of loss. Well, Mr. Price-Waterhouse-
Cooper-Smythe Esq. it is partly down
to an increased subvention from the
College – this is basically the pocket
money the Union gets from College
every year to buy our silence and
something to look pretty in. Along
with more money from the College,
the Union made a significant amount
of money elsewhere, such as the Cen-
tenary Ball (the Summer Ball all tarted
up) which made a £12,302 surplus and
was an outright success compared
to the previous year’s loss of £44,697.
There have been some mutterings
though that the Centenary Ball did not
make as much as was hoped (consider-
ing you only have one centenary), but
this amount was also bolstered by a
vast increase in van hiring income of
over £30,000 (after expenditure) fol-
lowing the previous year’s loss. Other
ventures allowing the sabbs to bathe
in crispy ten-pound notes included a
successful Careers Fair and returns on
investment.
In conclusion, there can be back-
slapping all around after a successful
year during a period of management
restructuring and other difficulties. To
highlight this, since the new manage-
ment has been in effect there has been a
very successful Freshers’ Week includ-
ing the Union being packed out with
over 800 people for the Rugby World
Cup Final. If one can measure happi-
ness through material wealth then the
Union has some cause for a smile but
if it is found through every utterance
of “HELLAAAAMASSSSHUP” then
there is cause for celebration.

Too many qualifications
spoil the academic broth
On Tuesday the government an-
nounced a further three Diplomas,
taking the planned total to seventeen.
Diplomas are the government’s lat-
est attempt to shake up the education
system for students aged 14 – 19 years
old. From September 2008, pupils in
the UK in years 10, 12 and above will
be given the choice whether to take
GCSEs, A-Levels, Diplomas or a mix-
ture of two.
The drastic reformation is happen-
ing due to continuing improvements in
A-Level and GCSE results, with many
critics believing the qualifications are
becoming stale and too easy. Similarly,
complaints from universities that dis-
tinguishing between school leavers’
talents is too difficult has helped put
one of the final nails in the A-Level’s
coffin.
Five of the Diplomas will be available
for students to begin studying next
year, namely Engineering, Creative
& Media, Information Technology,
Society Health & Development and
Construction & The Built Environ-
ment. The courses are designed to mix
classroom learning with experience in
the workplace in a move which will see
students being nurtured for the “real
world” even earlier than before.
Ed Balls, the Schools Secretary, who
announced on Tuesday that the three
new Diplomas would be in sciences,
humanities and languages, said that
Diplomas should become the “qualifi-
cations of choice”. The government has
stated that the Diplomas will be run
alongside existing qualifications until
2013, by which time it plans to have
comprehensively reviewed the A-Level
system. Potentially, A-Levels could be
scrapped within six years.
However, with the current multitude
of GCSEs and A-Levels on offer to
students, many people feel that mak-
ing further qualifications available to
students is just going to cause confu-
sion. Further condemnation comes
from various teachers’ Unions, with
the headteachers’ union ASCL saying
teachers are already “punch drunk”
with other reforms. The ATL teachers’
union blasted the government claim-
ing that they are taking half-hearted
measures in response to improving
A-Level standards, saying that they’ve
“bottled it again”.
The news comes at a time of great
change for the UK’s education system.
There is a distinct danger that the Di-
plomas could just be brushed aside in
the future, as lesser qualifications than
A-Levels or GCSEs. Mr Balls seems to
be aware of this, as well as the need for
industry and university backing stating
that, “we need the business and aca-
demic worlds to back these qualifica-
tions and help make them a success.”
“With their success” he believes, “Di-
plomas could emerge as the jewel of
our education system.”
Relying on the business and univer-
sity worlds to make the UK’s education
system work will come as a frighten-
ing prospect to some. At a time when
all academic qualifications, from Key
Stage 2 to postgraduate level, are be-
ing devalued following criticism of the
widespread “Mickey Mouse” subjects,
there is much anxiety amongst stu-
dents of all ages as they are confused
by the increasing choice and spiralling
cost of our education.
