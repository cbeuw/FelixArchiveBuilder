How to play:
Using the letters given, not more than
once, make as many words as possible.
They must be at least four or more let-
ters long and each word you come up
with must include the central letter.
Capitalised words, conjugated verbs
(past tense etc), adverbs ending in
“-ly”, comparatives and superlatives are
disallowed.
An example of a word you can’t do in
this particular Polygon is “felix”. Clear-
ly, this is not possible because you are
missing the letters “f”, “e”, “l”, “i” and
“x”. Another word that is not allowed
would be “ass” as this clearly only has
three letters. I think you get the general
idea...
How to rate yourself:
Under 4 words: How the heck did you
get into Imperial, you imbecile? Maybe
it was a typing error by an administra-
tor as dumb as you... go check.
4 – 8 words: You’ll never graduate at
this rate! Either that or you aren’t an
English student. Go throw yourself off
Queen’s Tower.
9 – 11 words: Oooh so close but so far,
you’re getting there! Something about
persistance, or is it perspiration?
12 or more words: Flipping ‘ell,
your cunning linguistic skills are
astounding!

Last week’s solution:
The only seven letter word was:
NIPPLES
Congratulations to everyone with
nipples.
Other words included:
isle. leis, lien, liens, lies, line, lines, lips,
lisp, nipple, nips, penis, pepsin, pies,
pile, piles, pine, pines, pins, pipe, pipes,
pips, plies, sine, slip, snip, snipe, spiel,
spile, spine, spinel, spline
Isn’t it interesting that you can get the
word “penis” from “nipples”?!
