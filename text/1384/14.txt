Sabbs defeated. Islamic
Society too hot to handle
O
n Tuesday afternoon,
the Sabbatical Offic-
ers: Ally Cott, Kirsty
Patterson and Tomo
Roberts, accompa-
nied by the Felix Sport Editor, Jo-
van Nedić, entered the ring for the
first round of Challenge the Sabbs.
The challenge was a test of courage,
nerve, stupidity and bowel capacity:
a chilli eating contest.
The four Sabbs would face-off
against four members of Islamic
Society who were foolish enough to
think they were tough enough to beat
the Union's finest. This took place
over four rounds, not surprisingly.
Members of each team would go
one-on-one with members of the
other team. Four different types of
chilli were provided for consump-
tion, ranging from large green gut
busters to the Chillies Of Death™
(pictured on the opposing page).
The task for the contestants was to
eat one chilli at the same time as the
other person. If one of the fighters
couldn't finish their chilli, they lost
the round. Simple.
First up: Tomo Roberts versus
Ammar Waraich. Leading from
the front, Tomo hoped to rally the
troops who were nervously spectat-
ing at this point.
The banter and stinky chat began
as Tomo took the first bite, seem-
ingly enjoying the spicy taste and
pungent aroma of the first green
chilli. Ammar was having none of it,
clearly seeing through Tomo's arro-
gant smokescreen. The first chillies
were consumed much to the pleas-
ure of the small crowd of Islamic So-
ciety supporters that had gathered
around the tables. Chillies two and
three were gradually masticated and
swallowed.
By now, the audience was gasping
with horror as the smell of the little
devils swept like a tsunami across the
boards of Dalby Court. It was time
for the fourth and final chilli. Both
competitors were clearly feeling the
burn and any earlier bravado had
subsided. Tomo played the waiting
game, but Ammar was wise to this as
he took a bite out of a dreaded Chilli
Of Death™. Enough was enough.
Tomo conceded to which the crowd
roared with delight. 1-0 to Islamic
Society.
Next up, Felix Sport Editor Jov
was toe-to-toe with Isnain Shah.
