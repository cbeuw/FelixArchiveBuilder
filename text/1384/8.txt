Southside’s fancy dress Olympics

An update on what we’ve been up to
Jennifer Morgan
President
Royal College of
Science Union
A
new academic year
and a brand new hall
of residence! Actually
three brand new halls
of residence located on
the site of the old Southside building,
which some staff and students still re-
member and tell horror stories about.
Now many good people, including ex-
perienced wardens and long serving
members of the residences staff, had
warned me what it would be like to
share a room in a new hall but nothing
could have prepared me for the highs
and lows of the first month and the in-
credible effort on the part of everyone
involved!
Traditionally, the week before move-
in day (a.k.a. Hall Senior week) is a
very busy time for Wardens, Hall sen-
iors and Residence staff. On this occa-
sion, however, the party was joined by
a few senior members of college staff, a
large number of builders and contrac-
tors, and a regiment of students paid to
get all the little (and not so little) jobs
done in time for arrival day.
And then the kick-off. Between
8:00am and 8:00pm on Saturday Sep-
tember 29th, in Falmouth Keogh alone,
we moved in 150 students, and an extra
few hundred parents (that we also had
to move out shortly afterwards). And
all this adjacent to the poshest building
site that South Kensington has to offer,
decorated to the highest standard with
autumnal leaf designs.
As with many other halls, we used
a few of the tried and tested Fresher
welcome events – formal dinners, boat
trips, welcome BBQs and IC Union
events to name but a few. Unlike other
halls the trio at Southside (Selkirk Hall,
Tizard Hall, and Falmouth Keogh Hall)
took it upon themselves to try a large
scale joint event in the form of a fancy
dress Olympics. Yes you heard it, three
halls, three fancy dress themes and as
many silly competitions as you can fit
under one tent on the Queen’s Lawn.
I won’t go into the details of too
many individual event results, mainly
because numbers remain extremely
controversial to this day. It should be
noted, however, that the Zombies in
Pyjamas from Falmouth Keogh made
an excellent start in the limbo com-
petition, Tizard’s Animals and Farm-
ers were very strong in the high speed
cream cracker eating, and Selkirk put
in an impressive performance on the
football pitch with both their School-
boys and Schoolgirls clinching key
victories.
In the final reckoning, once dancing
ability and costumes had been taken
into account, most agree that Selkirk
were the overall victors on the night. I
like to console myslef in the fact that
it’s never easy being dressed as a pen-
guin or a member of the undead in
night time attire.
I like to think Lord Falmouth and
Sir Alfred Keogh (yes, they were two
people) would have been pleased with
my efforts in the warden’s Space Hop-
per race which proved to be one of the
most contentious events of the night,
and one of the most enjoyable for stu-
dents. The rumours that three shady
individuals have booked Ethos for reg-
ular space-hoppering sessions through
the next year are, of course, completely
unfounded.
Wardening the
Almighty Organ
I
realise that what I said last week
may have caused some alarm,
and for that I’m very sorry. To
clear up any confusion that I
caused, I’m going to set the
record straight this week – I’m defi-
nitely not left-wing. If any of you were
worrying that I swung the other way,
please put your minds at rest. That’s
not to say that I’m voting Conserva-
tive, necessarily – my opinion on Boris
Johnson is as steadfast as a bet on a
Ken Livingstone landslide – but it does
mean that most of my political views
veer away from the red beret and more
towards, yes, that whiny twat you knew
in the sixth form who ended up read-
ing PPE at Oxford.
Allow me to elucidate. This week’s
Angry Geek comes to you from my lo-
cal Starbucks – the most convenient
way to exploit the third world without
leaving the comfort of the high street
or going into H&M. I’m sitting here,
pen in hand, breathing in the delightful
smell of an Americano, dusted with the
broken backs and shattered dreams of
south American coffee growers. And
I’m okay with it. Because, unfortunate-
ly, I enjoy the poor being poor.
I’m not just saying this to get a knee-
jerk here – there’s no easy way to say
that you support the obviously unfair
treatment of millions of people. But I
do. I think it’s a necessary part of the
smooth running of the world, and
more importantly I think it’s the lesser
of two evils.
You see, I don’t really want equality.
And it’s not because I’m afraid some-
one’s going to turn up here one day and
be able to solve quadratic equations
faster than me. Believe me, I can fac-
torise those bad boys faster than you
can write a letter complaining about
the ever-decreasing standard of Felix’s
comments page. It’s because equality of
life is stupid if it’s forced upon people.
Take, for instance, Third World Debt.
I’m all for cancelling it. I think it’s a
great idea, because the kind of debt that
mentally rapes even the idea of getting
accountants in is obviously a lose-lose
situation for everyone involved. I don’t
go for the usual Right-y line of bleeding
the bastards dry because they’re not
PLU. Cancel the debt – lovely. Actually
start dishing out money and support in
order to get everyone on a level play-
ing field afterwards? Not really such a
good idea.
Countries go through a delicate
process of modernisation once they
begin developing. Agricultural Revo-
lution, Industrial Revolution, Political
Revolution and Dance Dance Evolu-
tion. Whether or not the J-Pop arcade
classic was evolutionary rather than
merely a rehashing of the genre is one
best left for the games journalists, but
the preceding three stages, no matter
what order they come in, have to be
gone through at a sensible pace. Not
unlike the J-Pop arcade classic itself.
Similarly, I don’t think that shov-
ing everyone into a higher education
degree is a fantastic idea either – not
because it means there’s less room for
people from public schools, because
truth be told I’m about as common
as they come except that instead of
watching ITV in the evenings I… well,
I don’t want ITV in the evenings. It’s
because it means there’s less room,
both in universities and in the public
psyche, for students who are genuinely
up for their courses.
I think prejudice is as retarded as the
next internet meme. This week in the
Book section, I pick apart bit by bit a
book that is so awful, so completely,
retardedly awful, that I can’t believe
anyone agreed to publish it, author
credentials or no. But that does not
mean that I skip around all day look-
ing for ways to make the world equal.
It’s not. The truth is the world is pain-
fully unequal, and attempts to balance
things that are inherently imbalanced
– through our influence centuries ago
or not – ends in everything spilling
over and the world going wrong.
T
he Royal College of Sci-
ence of Union (RCSU) is
the constituent faculty
union for the scientists at
Imperial and we’re being
proactive in making sure our students
are happy! On Monday 29th October
we’ve got a Halloween themed bar
night in the Union bar with £2 entry for
those in fancy dress and £3 for those
boring people who aren’t! (No extra
charge for non scientists.) Drink all of
our kegs and bottles dry! And expect
to find mummy rolling competitions,
yard of ale competitions and spooky
giveaways!
But it’s not all about rollicking so-
cials. Now all of the year reps have
been elected we’ll be finding out what
you really think of your academic life
at Imperial. The National Student Sur-
vey highlighted some common themes
which Imperial students are unhappy
about so it’s high time we encouraged
college to sort it out! Assessment and
feedback seems to be the largest area
where students are unhappy – how
much feedback do you get about your
work and how long does it take for your
work to be returned to you? In the early
stages of investigation I don’t think our
lecturers and tutors are at fault – most
of us seem to be more than satisfied
with our teaching and support from
individual staff members, but are there
enough of them and are they under too
much pressure in other areas so that
they do not have enough time to give
us feedback on our work? That’s one
example but we also want to find out
about your workloads, IT access, lec-
ture notes and printing costs, and are
you being crowded out of your lecture
theatre – are there too many people
on your course? We could go on…. It’s
worth mentioning that Imperial is ac-
tually rated very highly in overall satis-
faction from students so we also want
to find out what you’re really happy
with and give credit where credit’s due
too!
Obviously it’s not all about academia
– that’s only part of university life!
What we have noticed is how many
continuing students are finding it in-
creasingly difficult to get private ac-
commodation sorted out. Rent costs
are rocketing in the capital! We might
not be able to bring down your rent but
we can make sure the private accom-
modation office can provide enough
information and support. Share your
views with us.
So what happens when we get all this
information? We won’t just sit on it I
promise! If used to its full potential the
resources are already in place to turn
this information into action. There are
loads of committees in college and the
union where all of these issues can be
thrown up and acted upon. The only
trouble is making the people on those
committees more proactive in what
they do. I’ve sat on too many commit-
tees where too much time has been
spent on arguing the correct wording
and punctuation of section 3.4.1… but
with more training being provided this
year lets keep our fingers crossed for a
turn around!
It’s not that nobody cares about stu-
dent democracy... most people don’t
even know about it and that’s the
problem.
