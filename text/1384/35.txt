Sport
This is my new (hopefully) weekly bit
in Felix to keep you all up to date with
the happenings of all the Sports Clubs
in the ACC who maybe don’t get the
publicity they deserve.
Firstly this week, and I’m sure you’ve
been admiring them on the centre
pages, the Netball 1st team have had
a couple of fantastic results recently,
winning 63-19 last Wednesday in
BUSA, and then beat St George’s 2s
48-7 on Monday evening in ULU.
They’ve finally learnt how to write,
so read all about their exploits in the
match report over here.
Other highlights of the season so
far in the ACC have been the Mens
Hockey 1s thrashing Royal Free 1s 8-1
in BUSA, and the Ladies 1s making
a solid start with a 3-3 draw against
Reading 1s. Another remarkable per-
formance was from the Table Tennis
team who destroyed Kings College
16-1! Mens Football also made a solid
start to the season, the 1s starting their
BUSA campaign with a 2-0 victory
against Westminster last week.
I’m writing this on Tuesday so have
no idea what the big results section
over there looks like, so hopefully we’ll
have had plenty of great results on
Wednesday to continue the very good
start to the season across the board!
A quick report to you all now on the
ACC bar night that we held on the
second Wednesday of term; we tried
something different this time, and due
to a massive turnout, a new record in
fact, you may have felt like you didn’t
get enough red beer for your mon-
ey?! Well you’re probably right as the
evening actually turned a profit, against
our plans to break even, or even make a
small loss. With the profit we did make
we’re going to try and ensure that the
next bar night to be held near to the
end of term is another record breaker,
and that you can get your hands on
more drink than you can shake a hock-
ey stick at. Any suggestions about how
we can do this should go to your club
captains so they can be discussed at
the next ACC meeting.
If you’re reading this and thinking
‘what about my club’s excellent result’
then you need to write a match report
to be put into Felix, or let me know
about it so I can briefly mention it here.
Remember, this is your newspaper, and
that means you need to contribute,
either through my little section, or by
writing a match report in yourselves.
For members of all ACC Clubs, and
anyone else who isn’t a member yet,
but wants to be, my email is lt04@ic.ac.
uk and you can email me at any time to
find out about playing sport here at IC,
I can put you in contact with the right
people for your chosen sport.
Hopefully I’ll have got the hang of
this by next week and actually have
something to write about, so for now,
enjoy your sport, and remember, I can’t
shout about your achievements unless
you tell me about it!

Imperial’s Team of the Week
This week, the Netball 1st team are
Imperial’s Team of the Week for
their outstanding win against Uni-
versity of Greenwich 1st. The girls
managed to score 63 points in a 60
minute game, that’s just over a score
a minute (or for the keen eyed ones
out there 1.05 points per minute).
Well done girls, let’s hope the cur-
rent run continues.

Sports Partnership
The Sports Partnership is an alliance
between Sport Imperial and Imperial
College Union to oversee the develop-
ment of student sport at Imperial.
The aims of the Partnership are to
promote and enhance the perform-
ance and participation in student sport
across the College in a safe environ-
ment through professionalism, rel-
evant administrative support systems
and advice.
This alliance between Sport Impe-
rial and the Union provides the op-
portunity for students to benefit from
the many opportunities that are avail-
able to them such as coaching, sports
development, sports kit, club spon-
sorship and facility usage, as well as a
dedicated student sport administrative
presence based at the Union through
the Sports Partnership Administrator.
The Partnership seeks to encourage
and support students to participate in
organised sports through leagues and
ladders, i.e. 5-a-side football leagues
and squash ladders; the Sports Am-
bassador Scheme – the opportunity
for students to gain a sports coaching
qualification; BUSA support to help
maximise the performance of Imperial
sides; and developing clubs by provid-
ing help with coaching, kit, facilities
and so on.
Since the Partnership was launched
last year, Imperial’s BUSA ranking has
leapt by a massive 10 places from a
measly 39th to a mighty 29th.

Pre-workout
meals
Kelly McKenzie
Eating before your workout is some-
thing a lot of people aren’t too clear
on. Should you eat before you train?
Well it’s all about getting the balance
right and finding out what works best
for you.
It’s not advisable to eat too much pri-
or to exercise as this can make you feel
tired or, worse still, cause upset stom-
ach and cramping. However, not eating
at all prior to training can also have a
negative effect. Low blood sugar levels
can cause us to feel weak, tired or faint.
It can also affect our mental ability.
What should we eat then prior to
training? Carbohydrate is our bod-
ies preferred source of fuel as it can
be easily digested, therefore you want
this to form the main part of your pre
workout meal. When should you eat
your pre workout meal?
• Large meal, eat 4-6 hours prior to
exercise
• Smaller meal, eat 2-3 hours before
exercise
• Snack, depending on content,
eat around 30 to 60 minutes prior to
exercise
Please remember these are just
guidelines. There are no hard and fast
rules - what might work for you may
not work for the next person.
