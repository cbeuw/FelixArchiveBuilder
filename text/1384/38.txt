To crunch or not to crunch?
Andy Mitchell
Energia Fitness Instructor
Sports league
Training of the abdominal region is
probably the most carried out, most
talked about and most misunderstood
area of everyone’s exercise regime. Lets
discuss.
Let me tell you now, forget what
you have read about in magazines and
newspapers or seen on TV - doing a
million and one abdominal exercises
will never get you a flat stomach. Okay
now for the good news - everyone has
a flat stomach. Unfortunately most
people tend to have a certain amount
of body fat covering it. This fat, ladies
and gentlemen, cannot be burnt off by
doing stomach after stomach exercise.
A balanced healthy diet and plenty of
varied exercise is the only way to re-
duce body fat. Fat reduction and the
best methods of achieving it will be
discussed in future articles.
So if in order to get a flat stomach
we need to eat well and exercise more,
why do we do abdominal exercises at
all? Well, exercising the abdominal
muscles will make them bigger just like
any other muscle as long as you use the
correct number of repetitions and sets
and are taking in the right nutrition and
levels of rest. However the increase in
size is unlikely to be noticeable to any
great degree and unless you have a low
body fat percentage you are not going
to see any real definition anyway.
The main reason we should train the
abdominal muscles is to aid the stabil-
ity and support of our spine and pelvis
during the movement of our arms and
legs and as a link in the kinetic chain to
transfer force from the legs up through
to the arms. While we are talking about
stability and support let me clear up a
common misunderstanding - abdomi-
nal training is not core training. The
abdominal muscles are some of the
major contributing muscles of the core
but training them does not mean you
are training your core. The core is an
interlinking system of many muscles
involving complex motor programmes.
To explain what it is, how it works, and
how to train it would be digressing
from the current topic of discussion so
I suggest you come and speak to one
of the Energia instructors for more
information.
Howthen,dowetraintheabdominals
for stability and support of the spine
and pelvis, or in the transfer of force
through the body? Sadly crunches, ob-
lique crunches, leg raises etc aren’t the
answer. The rectus abdominis (the “6
pack”) is designed to work as a major
stabiliser of the spine, predominantly
in full spinal extension. It is not de-
signed to be crunched, crunched, then
crunched some more. In fact the main
result of crunching away is to increase
the muscle’s resting tone causing a
shortness of the muscle which leads to
imbalances in the body which in turn
will lead to numerous injuries, aches
and pains, predominantly of the lower
back and neck region.
Have a good look at most footballers
(sorry to pick on you footballers out
there but you tend to do a vast amount
of crunches in your training!) from the
side and you will invariably see a de-
pressed rib cage and a forward head
posture (your ears by the way should
be in line with your shoulders not in
front of them!). Oblique crunches,
bicycle crunches and exercises along
those lines will also cause the same
problems.
You’ll have to come and find our
page again next week to learn how you
should train your abdominal muscles.
Week 3 and a lot more results are in.
The ranking of the teams is based on
the Felix Index (FI), which is calculated
as follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) – (L*3).
The netball girls are the new leaders of
the league after a string of amazing re-
sults, whilst the Lacrosse team are sad-
ly bottom. If you think I’ve missed out
any BUSA results, please let me know
and I’ll add them next week.
