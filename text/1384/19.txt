of the brilliant conditions and fantastic
scenery highlighted by recent Europe-
an Championships held at Rayskala. In
total, sixteen icGC members went on
tour, including four assistant instruc-
tors, two of which had nothing better
to do than stay for the whole month!
Having arrived in Finland after an
epic two day drive, we found the club
very friendly, welcoming, and well kit-
ted out! What first strikes you on take-
off is the awesome beauty of the loca-
tion. Lakes shimmer like mirrors, with
the glider’s reflection slipping beneath
the shining wings, and from horizon to
horizon green fields, forests and lakes!
Within the first few days we had al-
ready started to explore the local area,
some pilots doing cross countries up to
400km, pottering at 90kph, whilst oth-
ers gained their Silver durations and
flew dual cross countries in the two-
seater. Well done to Rory Condon and
Tom Sibley for their Silver durations,
and commiserations to Claire Malpas
– who needed relief – and Emma Wor-
ley, who ran out of day. Later on, Rory
managed to complete the set with a
160km Silver distance! Other achieve-
ments early on included a first single-
seater flight by Christian Morsbach.
Away from the airfield, we did as the
Finns do: drank plenty of beer, and en-
joyed some sauna and larking about in
the lake. Very little sleep was had ini-
tially, because in early July it never gets
dark, and we had no idea what time it
was! Night time is just one big sunset
that turns into sunrise again, and no
photograph can quite do the experi-
ence justice: it is truly breathtaking.
Occasionally we lost a few days to
rainy weather, it never got as bad as
the UK – no new lakes were formed
– but this allowed us to enjoy Finn-
ish culture, by visiting Helsinki, and of
course Moomin World! Another thing
worthy of note is the ‘Harmageddon’,
an extremely spicy pork dish served by
a pub local to the airfield: it has its own
health warning, and Shaun Murdoch
can personally confirm that it deserves
it!
Getting back to gliding, almost every
flyable day we found was soarable to
some degree. The forests seemed to
be an excellent store of energy, while
the lakes worked as
the trigger. On
good days, it was
soarable from
about 8am to
8pm, and Rayskala
will give launches at
10pm if you like! Cloud
bases were anything from
6000 to 9000 feet, with good
4-9 knot thermals, which isn’t
too bad really. Only in Finland
would you consider going off
cross-country at 6pm! This gives
a really very long day, which is
great when you have six people to fly
and three gliders: everyone can have as
much soaring and training as they can
take! With multiple instructors, at least
two at all times, there was ample op-
portunity for everyone to get what they
wanted out of the expedition.
On planning the expedition, the
committee had declared one little ex-
tra goal: for the two-seater Grob 103 to
fly further than it ever had done previ-
ously: a 527km triangle task. In the last
week, the day to do it finally arrived so
Sage Shah and Shaun Murdoch got to
it. Before leaving, the tour members
were all interviewed by the Helsingin
Sannomat, the most widely circulated
newspaper in Scandinavia, who were
very interested in why we had travelled
North for the summer. Their photog-
rapher took photos of them setting
off on task, and later commented that
she didn’t realise Finland had so many
lakes! The story was run the next day,
and icGC officially became an interna-
tionally known club!
Back on task, things went well for
most of the run, staying high to remain
in glide of land-able sites; the pilots
were enjoying an awesome view, and
equally good thermals. They had to
cross a few areas of poor thermal activ-
ity, which slowed them down, but they
completed the first 300km unevent-
fully. Then the top cover started com-
ing in, and they tiptoed along, trying
to edge closer to where the sun was on
the ground. Arriving at the second turn
point, Oripaa Airfield, at about 6:30pm
“Night time is
just one big
sunset that turns
into sunrise
again”
“8 hours of
flying time...
422km wasn’t a
bad effort”
they hung on for ages in the blue,
and eventually picked up a 3knot
thermal to start on their way home.
Unfortunately, that second thermal
that would have actually got them
most of the way back to Rayskala
never came, and they landed in a
field at around 7:30pm after well
over 8 hours of flying time! Still,
422km wasn’t a bad effort! Jamie
Denton, who had set off on the
same task but in an ASW-24, got
back and completed the task: well
done him!
All in, this very adventurous ex-
pedition – the furthest icGC has
been in some years, with the most
gliders – was very well worth it!
The view from the air is spectac-
ular and the sheer level of soar-
ing and cross country that can be
achieved in such a short space of
time is truly phenomenal. The peo-
ple are friendly, and the lifestyle is
fun: great for a holiday, even bet-
ter for a gliding holiday! I am sure
icGC will return there in the not so
distant future.
If you want to come and try
gliding for yourself, come
along to one of our meetings
on Fridays at 12:30pm in
Aeronautics Room 254. We try
to fly every weekend, using
minibuses or members cars
to get to Lasham. A trial flight
costs £35 and includes a 20
minute flight. Membership of
the club is £40 per year, and
an average flight costs around
£10. Email the Captain emma.

meetings and ask questions!
