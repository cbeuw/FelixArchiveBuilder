KEEP THE CAT FREE
This phrase is no doubt familiar to
many members of college - it is of
course the motto of Felix (dating
from the first issue in 1949). It
refers not to the price, but to our
editorial freedom. It has been
appearing less prominently in recent
years, as myself and others have
believed, erroneously it seems, that
it could be taken as read.
Felix is not a college newspa-
per, nor is it a union paper, though
it receives generous funding from
ICU. It is an independent s t u -
dents' newspaper, it is registered
as a public newspaper and its con-
tent is bound only by national law.
These facts are clearly not
appreciated by many people
around college, notably those stu-
dents currently running the Royal
College of Science Union (RCSU).
For those fortunate enough not to
have read the articles in question,
here is a choice morsel:
"1 cannot believe that Felix ...
should publish an article about the
death [of a chemistry student] on
the morning of a chemistry exam
before the official announcement
... You d o not publish articles
unless you have been told that you
can. If you cannot be bothered to
d o your research first... you should
not be allowed the responsibility to
carry such stories until officially
told y o u can by College or the
Department concerned."
W e do publish articles without
permission from college, and to
suggest otherwise is ludicrous - if
we waited for them to give us news,
Felix wouldn't be worth the paper
it's written on. Besides, both the
Director of Undergraduate Studies
in chemistry and the College Tutor
were aware of our decision in
advance, and respected it without
fuss. Perhaps if you had done a little
research yourself, you would have
dicovered and respected the fami-
ly's wishes to avoid mentioning the
cause of death, as w e did.
The point is that author of pub-
lished material holds a great
responsibility - a fact which I
learned the hard way.
Independence brings accountabili-.
ty. With reporting like theirs, the
RCSU should be glad that they are
not in the public d o m a i n .
