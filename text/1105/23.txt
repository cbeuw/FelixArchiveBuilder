G o a l y S p i r i t Oxford scum must die!
ICFC I v LSE I
The Firsts went into the g a m e
against LSE flying high following
last Wednesday's superb 4-1 w i n
at Kings, Mikael Askerdal, was ruled
out with a groin injury, while Donal
Keane was retained in goal.
The first half was disappointing
as Imperial failed to show their
superiority. Indeed they went a
goal d o w n after Jules Porreca need-
lessly gave the ball away to an LSE
striker w h o ran through to score. It
was LSE's only shot on target in the
whole game. Imperial fought back
and were soon level. Warren Brayn
had a left-foot drive blocked by the
LSE goalkeeper, but winger Richard
Pratt was well p o s i t i o n e d to
equalise from the rebound. Pratt
might have put Imperial in front
shortly after, but 1-1 at half-time
was probably fair.
The second half started brightly
and Alex M a r c o s should have put
Imperial in front on more than one
occassion. LSE sporadically threat-
ened on the counter-attack, but did
not manage to create a single scor-
ing opportunity. Psycho brought o n
G e r m u n d Knutsen as Imperial
looked for a winner near the end,
but a draw always looked the more
likely outcome. The sides clash
again on Saturday when the Firsts
will look for more creative ideas up
front.
ICFC 1 1 - 1 LSE I
ICFC II v U C L III
A nearly full team - the only regular
absent w a s Felix ' T o a d f i s h '
Schroeder, an upset s t o m a c h
caused by a dodgy pie putting our
Teutonic Terrier out of the action.
Within minutes of the start, Chris'
nightmare '98 continued as he
palmed a shot to the ground at his
feet, from where it was blasted
into the back of the net.
It became clear that w e were
the better team. A ball from Pat
gave Si some space, He strode for-
ward towards the retreating U C
defence. A neat through-ball
released Pistol Pete w h o placed a
shot over the keeper.
W e took the lead when Andy
Ferguson's free-kick s q u i r m e d
through the U C wall and was duly
buried by Si.
A n d y c o n t i n u e d his superb
form at right-back, james w a s
forced to send an abusive o p p o s i -
tion player off, increasing our grip
on the game. With U C L pressing
for the equaliser a superb break
saw Martin put the game out of
their reach with a typical poacher's
goal.
With promotion looking a real-
istic goal a n d the huge B U S A
booster against Kingston next
week, these are exciting times for
ICAFC seconds.
ICFC II 3 - 1 UCL III
Truly Scrumptious
/ would like to apologise for the woeful nature of this headline - Jacob
RCSRFC v Fulham &
Hammersmith
W h e n the RCS rugby executives
arrived at the Union at 1 2 all that
was to be found was a barren
wasteland. After m u c h m o a n i n g
and groaning in the m i d d l e of
Prince's gardens by s p e w tannoy, a
small army of 1 3 ventured d o w n to
the "Hurlingham Park International
Arena."
The g a m e started by ' N i p p l y '
crashing over the line in true scrum
half style(?) after effective rucking.
The second came rapidly after our
elusive N o . 8, not prop, picked up
and burst through away from the
scrum half, p o p p i n g to Nipply w h o
used his amazing passing capabili-
ties to give it to Jon "Alex?" B o u n d
w h o scored under the posts. A few
stupid mistakes and lapses of con-
centration enabled the " H a m m e r s "
to get back into the game.
In the second half, continueal
pressure from the lycra clad, vased
up PVCed scientists ended with
penetration of the o p p o s i t i o n ' s
banner by our star guest player
Buffy. The next try came from the
s c r u m half's awareness of the
game in missing the fly-half, giving
Hoggsy no choice but to 'hoist the
Gary O w e n ' which he then recov-
ered and p o p p e d to Telfa w h o
dived and streched to put the ball
d o w n for a " g o o d five pointer" (PJ).
They then scored a try due to our
lack of personnel. M a n of the
match, for the breaks and wobbling
of his belly was Spew.
RCSRFC 2 8 - 1 3 Ham & Fulham.
ICWHC I v Oxford
Well w e forgot our balls, the men
wouldn't go with us, and had to
borrow theres. Things w e r e n ' t
going looking too hot, but then,
while the subs were gossiping and
setting up a sweepstake o n the
final score (1 7 - 0?) Scouse Git (the
2nd's top scorer ) sneaked craftily
into the goal giving us a m o n u m e n -
tal 1 - 0 lead. This paved the way
for the rest of a storming game.
Super super defence and sex
goddess goalie saved the day more
than once.
Half time and congratulations
all round. Well, w e are shit hot after
all (and w e play pretty well tool).
Anyway w e told ourselves how
great w e are.
Second half, and Patsy stormed
on to the pitch and into the goal.
Are our talents neverending? 1 think
not. Anyway w e w o n 2 - 0 . All in a
days work for the super sexy babes
w h o are the IC Hockey birds! But
w e were on top form and have
never played like such heroes .
M u c h singing and a dodgy pit
stop on a not so hidden layby and
now we're pissed in the Union.
Well there's a suprise. W a t c h this
space as w e gradually conquer the
universe - and it will happen. Be
afraid, be very afraid.
ICWHC 2 - 0 Oxford
ICHC I v St BARTS I
U.L. cup semi final
Still hung over from friday night
exploits, w e set about far too early
on Sunday morning in our quest for
absolute d o m i n a t i o n of L o n d o n
hockey. Having rightly been
accused by the rest of the club of
being arrogant, it was time to
prove that men shall be m e n .
The w a r m up was done in the
changing r o o m as it was too cold
for us to w a r m up outside, A rous-
ing team talk by captain in the Bol
got everyone focused. St Barts had
w o n the BUSA merit group 1 and
ICHC II v UCL III
Play started and due our their
vigour, w e were awarded a penalty
flick. Goran totally fluffed the shot,
The rest of the half was total and
utter pants, those with skid marks
too. half time, 0 - 0.
After an enthralling team talk
and some inspired substitutions
w e actually managed to move out
of reverse gear into s o m e sem-
blance of forward motion.
Goran, w h o decided to rectify
his earlier miss, managed to shaft
the ball into the net. U C L took
m u c h chagrin from this a n d
pressed for an equaliser.
After a couple of goal mouth
scares, which were calmly dis-
pensed by Bill, l.C. strode up the
pitch and Shaggy stroked the ball
into the net, having now lost his
big thing. 2 - 0.
Nuff said. W e w o n . Roll on I.C.
2nds, Portsmouth here w e c o m e .
ICHC II 2 0 UCL III
so were favourites for this tie.
However, w e had other ideas. 5
minutes played, Sid the Sexist 'you
can't get class like that' cannily
chipped the goaly and all their
defenders on the line to open the
scoring. A straight bullet-strike
short corner from Chicken Bol, and
a beautiful execution of a break by
Sid the Sexist seemed to settle
things.
The second half saw Spag. Bol
(no relation to the captain) jump on
their goaly, allowing blue under-
pants to flick the ball into the top
corner:4-0. W e gave them a goal at
the end. ICHC I 4 - 1 St Barts
