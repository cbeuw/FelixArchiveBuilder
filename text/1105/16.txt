his is the story of one hot
s u m m e r in the 1930's
through the eyes of an eight
year old girl called Fidgie. Her nar-
ration tells of fishing trips in the
bay, picnic lunches and a new
found friendship with a boy called
Chaz. H o w e v e r her innocent
remarks about life around the bay
reveal a disturbing undercurrent of
deception and adultery amongst
the adults in her community. Whilst
Fidgie concerns herself with her
amusement in the day and the
opportunity to escape from her vin-
dictive elder sister Cly, there is ten-
sion building up around her. Fidgie
c o m b i n e s a naturally inquisitive
nature with spirit and seems to pick
up pieces of the puzzle but being
eight years o l d doesn't always
realise the relevance. The real story
is what is happening around Fidgie.
This is a cleverly constructed novel
with only snippets of information
c o m i n g through Fidgie, but the
reader can deduce more of the
story whilst leaving Fidgie in confu-
sion. The reader wants to ask ques-
tions, but an eight year old looks
for different answers, hence this is
an unusual novel where reading
between the lines is as important
as the text on t h e m . A n t h e a
Halliwell manages to successfully
reveal her characterisations to the
audience but not eight year old.
This is an enjoyable read that is well
constructed with strong characters
and intriguing storyline. Perhaps a
different genre to your usual read
but 1 would advise y o u to give it a
try.

We've all been naughty boys and
girls, apparently. Our Home
Secretary, Jack Straw (a previous
NUS President), says that we are
in the grip of a 'profound sense of
cynicism'. He has the sense not
to blame us for it: it was the
Tories' fault of course, their
record of self-serving indulgence
n Government is actually at the
root of the problem. This is how-
ever an admission of sorts that
the present Government has not
yet dispelled what they had
hoped to do earlier, allowing
them to regain the trust of the
people to govern more effectively.
Tony Blair has enlisted Jack Straw
to bring this message to the peo-
ple. Straw has been 'New Labour'
since before 'New Labour' even
existed - calling for the scrapping
of Clause Four while John Smith
was in charge. Other contenders
to bring this message across have
fallen by the wayside: Gordon
Brown and Robin Cook have had
unfavourable media attention
recently, and John Prescott is said
to have enough on his plate
already.
Jack Straw has a job o n his
hands. Tony Blair has called for
post-honeymoon speeches by col-
leagues as a result. Although his
popularity is still as high as ever,
his party's showing in the polls dis-
plays a growing sense of unease
among the public. But why should
this be? After all, our e c o n o m y is
doing wonderfully, rather better
that the rest of Europe (who are
presently mutilating their
economies to fit E M U criteria that
we could achieve fairly painlessly -
should we want to). Labour major-
ity in the C o m m o n s is as stratos-
pheric as it was in M a y . Britain is
showing a resurgence in popularity
abroad - the Government should
be laughing.
Perhaps the problem lies with
inexperience in Government, and
w e are simply witnessing the
teething troubles of what will be a
perfectly competent administra-
tion. I would suggest that it goes
deeper than that. In many ways
Labour are still behaving like an
Service work for them, tried to
replace them and it hasn't w o r k e d .
The aforementioned assistants are
hired personally by the minister. If
he rises, so does the assistant. If
the minister is fired, then the holi-
day is over for the assistant. This
breeds faint loyalty for the
Government at large - witness
G o r d o n Brown's 'boot boy',
Charlie W h e l a n , and his foul-
mouthed insults hurled at D o w n i n g
Street which came to the attention
of the press last Autumn.

O p p o s i t i o n party. W h e n they
arrived in Government they set
about changing some fairly funda-
mental ways in which the machin-
ery of Government itself works,
and it seems some of these deci-
sions would have benefited from a
little more forethought as to the
l o n g - t e r m c o n s e q u e n c e s . The
effective replacement of civil ser-
vants by political advisor, spin doc-
tors (call them what you will) has
meant a slight improvement in
d a y - t o - d a y m e d i a manipulation,
but when hell breaks loose, stories
got out of a hand and press atten-
tion increased. Ministers, rather
than learning to make the Civil
have been their lack of apprecia-
tion of the public effect of their
actions. W h e n the Lord Chancellor,
Lord Irvine, spent £ 6 5 0 , 0 0 0 of tax-
payer's money on his o w n apart-
ment, he should not have said that
public will thank him for it. Perhaps
Peter Kilfoyle, the Public Service
Minister should have thought twice
before ordering his chauffeur to
drive 200 meters from his
Whitehall office to Parliament, then
pulling over to the side (on one of
London's busiest roads), shouting
to an old friend: "Look at this -
great isn't it? Want a lift?" What
was Cherie Blair thinking when she
flew out her personal hairdresser
with her on a trip to the States?
(Although she d i d pay the flight
herself). That and the figures spent
in 'modernising' ministerial offices
- £ 1 7 , 0 0 0 for a i r - c o n d i t i o n i n g
here, £ 6 5 , 0 0 0 for redecoration
there, and it doesn't make for
happy reading in D o w n i n g Street.
H o w e v e r it taking the issue
d o w n to the level of student poli-
tics (dare 1 say it) for the media to
despair too m u c h at ministerial
spending. Some of the inverted
snobbery by ministers (the
Chancellor refusing to wear black
tie for City dinners) makes the jus-
tification of expenditure more diffi-
cult, but the root cause of much
office redecoration at least was the
Tories' refusal to spend m u c h on
it, for fear of being accused once
again of extravagance. Paddy
A s h d o w n ' s rather p o m p o u s calls
for 'a certain frugality ... even
meanness' should be ignored. The
Government of a country such as
ours should at least be able to pro-
vide offices and accommodation
for its most senior members in a
style which their position deserves.
O n the subject of the spin doctors
and political assistants, Tony
Blair's message to the Cabinet not
to get bogged d o w n and to see the
wider picture will hopefully not be
ignored. It w o u l d be a pity if the
Government was brought d o w n
with completely self-inflicted polit-
ical w o u n d s .
