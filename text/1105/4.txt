Dear Felix,
Firstly I would like to express
my agreement with the editorial
from last week [ 16 January]. 1 know
that many students at Imperial
College must be able to relate to
the issue put forward, as I certain-
ly can. London is a horribly isolating
place at times a n d s o m e t i m e s
when the pressure is o n , it is easy
to feel overpowered and to see no
way out of a situation. 1 t o o would
like to see more services set u p to
keep in touch with students w h o
are not attending college a n d to
help those w h o are distressed. A
g o o d example of the problems
with IC's counselling facilities is m y
own experience last year. It w a s
just after m y exams and I w a s feel-
ing terribly distressed a n d isolated.
I felt I had no one to talk to about
it, and so I went to see t w o sepa-
rate counsellors. O n e at Princes
Gardens a n d one at the Union.
Both were convinced I must have
terrible financial p r o b l e m s - it
seemed that w a s the only problem
there could be! I agree that finan-
cial issues are s o m e t h i n g that
counsellors have to deal with a lot
in London and are very important,
but these counsellors didn't even
take the time to ask what w a s
wrong with m e before launching
into their advice o n Student hard-
ship funds etc. The whole episodes
made m e feel like m y visits were a
waste of time and I ended up feel-
ing worse than before.
M y other reason for writing this
letter concerns the marking sys-
tems at this college. M y mother
lectures at a university where they
use a marking system in which
each student has a number instead
of using their name (rather like a
library PIN number), this eliminates
any problems with prejudice or dis-
crimination (racial, sexual, or 'just
don't get on' etc..) This system
should be implemented for labora-
tory work ( in tutorial work it is
important for the tutor to assess
individual students throughout the
year). As a girl I a m often speaking
with assessors for laboratory pro-
jects where the assessor in ques-
tion speaks mainly to the male stu-
dent/s a n d rarely to m e even
though I a m also doing the work or
the experiment. A t worse I have
met assessors w h o will not even
make eye contact with m e or sit
and chat to m y male co-students
without ever directing a w o r d to
me or listening to what I have to
say. I have even seen occasions
where the moderator and assessor
of an experiment were 'best friends'
and in these cases the moderator
w o u l d not dare to change the
assessors mark. I did wonder how
this idea of a more impersonal
marking system could incorporate
directly assessed laboratory work,
but a friend had the idea of sepa-
rate assessors and marks for the
laboratory and write up work, thus
removing the problem. I agree that
it is impersonal to be known as a
number, but it would only be for
the duration of the marking and
any interviews a n d discussions
could be held later.
I a m interested to know what
other students and particularly pro-
fessors think of m y idea a n d
whether it would be possible to
implement it in the near future.
From m y point of view the preju-
dices in assessors marking work
can make all the difference to a
final degree result.

Dear felix,
Be o n the look-out for people
(2-men, early twenties) selling
audio-speakers from the back of an
N-reg white van.
The sellers are con-men trying
to pass off equipment described by
a HI-FI dealer as "absolute rubbish
w e wouldn't pay a penny for", as
expensive, high-quality goods.
In particular beware of O m n i -
Audio products.

Dear Felix,
M a y 1 be permitted to have a
moan in what I consider to be m y
"local rag". I cycle to work [in
Prince's Gardens] but have to ride
along Imperial College Road and
the joke about nuns riding across
cobble stones comes to mind and
would make m e laugh if I didn't
have to concentrate so hard in
avoiding all the dangerous
obstructions o n that road.
Today m y colleagues had to
prevent a workman from sawing
through m y security padlock to
remove m y bike from the railing
outside my office. 1 was told not to
leave m y bike there but to padlock
it outside Linstead Hall where all
the other bikes are regularly van-
dalised. You will appreciate that 1
was not keen to d o that so 1 n o w
have to park m y bike in the base-
ment of Weeks Hall and this means
carrying it d o w n a flight of concrete
steps. N o t t o o difficult for strap-
ping young students but a pain for
a geriatric secretary like m e .
Does the college really want
me to contribute more to the pol-
lution and parking problems in this
area? What is so w r o n g about
parking bikes outside one's place of
work on a pavement which can
a c c o m m o d a t e both m y parked
bike and pedestrians without any
problem? Please don't tell m e it
looks unsightly because I could
point out that the scaffolding
around 9 and 10 Prince's Gardens
looks twice as bad a n d has been
there for several months.

/ too had my bicycle removed for
no apparent reason when it was
parked outside my office in Beit
Quad. I have attempted to
reclaim it several times, but the
guards on duty consistently
refuse to unlock the store.
Oh, and that scaffolding's not
going anywhere [Felix 1093]. Ed

Dear Felix,
Something I forgot to a d d to
yesterday's letter [Felix 1 104] is
simply that, if the sports editorial
was a joke then a) m y original mis-
sive becomes irrelevant and b) your
sense of humour is really shite.
Cheers
