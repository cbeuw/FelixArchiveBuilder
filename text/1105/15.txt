S
ky magazine is going to have
a lot to answer for if people
believe their quote that this is
"The first great film of 1998". This
is by no means a bad film, but to
recommend it to everybody in the
way they have will result in many
discontented audiences.
The film portrays the life of
Victor Kelly, leader of the notorious
Shankhill Butchers. The gang was
feared throughout Northern Ireland
during the late seventies after mur-
dering 19 people. Although alleged
to be Loyalist their victims included
five Protestants, demonstrating the
purely psychotic nature of their
enterprise. M o s t violent of all was
their leader, w h o built a reputation
by dispensing slow tortuous deaths
at random.

The question is whether this is
done well. The answer, pre-
dictably, is that it depends on what
you are seeking. If you are looking
for either a love story or hectic
action then you'll have seen
superior films. If, however, y o u
want an epic combination of the
two then this is unmissable.
I he most impressive visua
Titanic are surprisingly not found in
the sinking scenes but in the
meticulous reproduction of the
ship's interior. The audience
receives a real impression of both
the luxury found in first class and
the appaling work conditions in the
engine r o o m . The love story is
given a full two hours to develop
before the inevitable CGI sinking
scenes begin, but these are not
quite as exceptional as the hype

mattet, for by now the audience
actually cares what happens to
the leads and that alone is
something special. D Chris
Stuart Townsend is given the
dubious pleasure of playing this
unlikable character. He seems to
relish the role, however, and is
almost worryingly effective in his
chilling portrayal. As Kelly descends

becomes more and more believ-
able, but unfortunately the storyline
fails to maintain interest. The only
reason to keep watching is to enjoy
seeing h i m receive his
comeuppance. N o time is spent on
the motives behind his violence but
we are given an insight into his
family life and the bizarre
admiration he c o m m a n d s from
every female he encounters.
This week is probably not the
most fortunate time to release a
film about Loyalist hitmen.
However, director M a r c Evans will
not be upset if this causes some
a d d e d publicity. S o m e of the
scenes in the Welshman's second
major film s e e m to have no
purpose other than to cause con-
troversy. This is a shame as the
time would have been better spent
explaining some of the reasoning
behind Kelly's actions. A n
examination of the background to
Ireland's problems might have
a d d e d to our understanding of
Kelly's behaviour. It may also have
turned the film into something
more memorable than just another
violent feature about a particularly
ruthless killer. O
