THE ART OF THE HARLEY
Barbican Art Gallery
A Harley-Davidson yesterday
The Harley Davidson motorbike
originated from the garage of a M r
William S. Harley and a M r Arthur
Davidson in 1902. The first bikes
were robust a n d purposeful
machines intended to withstand
the rough roads of turn-of-the-cen-
tury America.
Around 1945, the first cus-
tomised bikes started to be pro-
duced and from that point on, the
honest iron workhorse of America
was lost in a sea of chrome, ape-
hanger handlebars and fatbob
tanks.
The 'Art of the Harley' follows
the history of customising through
its many different styles, from 'bob-
ber' (a basic stripped d o w n look) to
'chopper' (HUGE front forks) to
'lowrider' (short-arses only). The
latest styles are all about enclosed
car-type bodywork with stream-
lined curves and vivid paint-jobs.
The 'Ferrari Bike' is impressive, if
completely over the top. In total,
there is an assortment of about
thirty customs, each with a quick
note about their customisation. The
names, however, are worth the
journey alone: 'Hogzilla', 'Flight
Deville' and 'Tribute to Stevie Ray
Vaughan', all with high amusement
value.
Unfortunately, for genuine bik-
ing fans like myself, there seemed
to be an absence of what one could
call 'real bikes'. The bikes on show
were clearly never meant to be rid-
den on the roads and were more
art exhibits than functional motor-
bikes. Harley's claim that their bikes
offer y o u a "man and machine rid-
ing experience" was not realised in
this exhibition. The blurb intended
to convey the ethos of the tattooed
outlaw - a person in control of their
own destiny etc., but looking at the
glitzy, razzmatazz of the bikes o n
display, I w a s u n c o n v i n c e d .
Frankly, these customised bikes are
as born to be wild as a very nervous
laboratory mouse. A typical owner
is more likely to spend the after-
noon polishing their 'Frisco-style'
tanks than actually riding. The
mere thought of salty British winter
roads must set their arms twitching
for the Turtle W a x and chrome
cleaner. A quick glance round
established the identity of the
clean-cut Harley follower: a bunch
of middle-aged Sloanies, including
a couple in squeaky clean leathers
w h o obviously hadn't been riding
anything more rebellious than a
black cab that day. To confirm my
scepticism, the gallery funnelled us
into a well-stocked shop selling
branded T-shirts and jackets. Is the
Harley image all just one big mar-
keting exercise? Despite the flam-
boyance of the display, the exhibi-
tion is actually enjoyable. The
craftsmanship is simply superb, so
forget the fact that y o u are looking
at a motorbike, and let your eyes
feast o n a banquet of glittering
c h r o m e and technicolour paint-
work. It is worth going just to
immerse yourself for an evening in
a sea of quite sumptuous if slightly
lurid colour. G o on, let your eyes
live, and give them a break from the
sensory deprivation of college con-
crete grey. For just Â£3, with stu-
dent ID, it's a bargain.
As to what I think of the 'art' of
the Harley? Not m u c h better than
a candy pink X R 2 with smoked
glass w i n d o w s and a M a x Power
sticker...
