ALBUMS
IAN BROWN
Unfinished Monkey Business * * *
K
ing monkey, monkeyman or
any other random name with
'monkey' in it. All of these
have been used to describe the
man w h o used to front some non-
important band in the late eighties.
Ian Brown took up gardening, DJing
and did a bit of travelling after the
disintegration of the Stone Roses
back in 1996. H e was convinced at
that time that he had given up
music for g o o d . In his press
release announcing the split, he
called the music industry 'the filthi-
est business in the world' and said
blankly that he was glad that he
was leaving. A world was divided
at this announcement. Some said,
'Hey, that's the bloke that can't
sing, isn't it? It's a bloody g o o d job
that he's not gonna be making any
more stupid noises in the future!'
and then there was the cohort that
were crestfallen. Ian Brown was a
Stone Rose and he couldn't just
disappear, could he? Well, he d i d .
For a while, anyway. While fellow
ex-Rose John Squire was forming
up a band which included buskers
and other random musicians from
York, Brown's exact location was
unknown. W a s he in Europe some-
where? W a s he ever c o m i n g back?
W a s it true that he had cut his hair?
Rumours aside, he returned a
few months ago to tell us that he
was working on a project called
Under the Beach, The Pavement - a
reference to the French student
riots in the sixties. What it would
be like was anyone's guess - this is
a man w h o is quoted as saying that
he doesn't really like music in this
country and any music he likes he
has to import from places like
Jamaica. W o u l d his, then, be a
reggae album (imagine lyrics sung
in a cross between West Indian and
heavy M a n c u n i o n ) ? Well, no.
Brown chose not to add to the
repertoire of excellent music in the
vein of Bob marley and instead
returned with a sort of cross
between science fiction-fuelled
groove (My Star) as well as original
funky groove (Can't See Me) with
an essence of p o p thrown in (can't
think of a specific one here...)
Brown has given a lot of press
time to this album, s o m e t h i n g
whenever normally does. His face
is, at the moment, on about three
or four magazines and he even
appeared on Radio 1. There are
two themes to all his interviews.
First is the 'true' story of the Roses
break-up. This includes stories of
Squire's cocaine habit and how that
made him leave the band. The
second is his resolute mission to
tell the kids that cocaine is evil and
that no-one should get into it.
Very wise words indeed and ones

But what does that have to do with
the album? Well, nothing really.
But it does provide an interesting
backdrop as you plug your way
through the songs. A n d plug is
exactly what y o u do. After the first
three tracks, I was actually really
excited and was looking forward to
the next few songs. Could this be

softness that had graced his other
recordings, but it was a g o o d
move. Then came the next nine or
so songs. I couldn't believe how
unmemorable they were. Yeah,
there were a couple of nice ones,
but the rest just involved some
uninspired singing over some unin-
spired playing and song writing. I
can't end by saying that Ian Brown
is crap; he isn't. Just forgive him
for this one... m
