Life is "But a Dream" for ICU Boat Club
continued from page one
Bill M a s o n , the club's coach,
was also pleased with the
award, stating that the Lottery
Sports Fund has "recognised w e
are a centre of excellence". H e
views the grant as a c k n o w l -
edgement of the club's impres-
sive achievements a n d its con-
sistency at all levels. The award
makes up only a minority of the
total cost of the project, leaving
IC responsible for the remain-
der. Bill M a s o n answered accu-
sations of disproportionate allo-
cation of funds by referring to
the gruelling work regime
adopted by club members. H e
saw the project as just reward
for those such as their interna-
tionals w h o train 15 times a
week regardless of conditions.
M r . M a s o n feels the project will
address current problems of
"overcrowding" a n d in s o m e
areas "primitive" facilities.
The Boat Club's future
p r o s p e c t s have been further
been further enhanced by an
offer from Carlton Television for
an alternative boat race involving
Imperial College a n d another
force in British rowing in the
University of L o n d o n . Although
plans are only at an "infancy
stage" it is likely the event will be
held 3 weeks before the Oxford-
Cambridge race. The high pro-
file event could attract lucrative
s p o n s o r s h i p deals a n d boost
recruitment. Bill M a s o n
assessed IC's prospects in the
race as "excellent" a n d is con-
vinced the event will represent a
"new d i m e n s i o n of university
sport".
