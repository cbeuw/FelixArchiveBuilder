The concluding part...

both hands and blinking rapidly in • >rt tori

have laughed inwardly at the heroic efforts that
Ron was making to prevent himself from crying,
but n o w he felt an unknown empathy for N m .
They all craned up to look at the base.lof his
neck, gently removing his hands.:
"It's not a sting," said Z e d . They saw a small,
very red mark, about half an inch across.
"1 wonder if-"
"SHIT!" This time it was M a r c o , H e was bent
over clutching his cheek with both; hands, " O h
my G O D , that hurts," he rasped, his eyes firmly
screwed shut.
Dan and Zed looked around, panic-stricken.
"This isn't funny," half-whispered Z e d . the shrill
of hysteria very plain in his l l p e # All of them
wete in a half crouch, exceptflprvfton, w h o had
shut his eyes very tightly in a bid, t o exlrjude him-
self from the world.
Suddenly they heard the snap of a breaking
branch in the hedge that ran the length of the
field they were standing in. Afyoice called out.
"Ha ha, h o w does it feel? Can't the little
brats take pain like grown men?"
Dan straightened u p . H e was sweating
repeatedly under his breath. T w o figures leapt
out of the hedge and started sauntering towards
them. O n e of them was lazily waving a black air
rifle with telescopic sight at them;
Dan, M a r c o a n d Z e d immediately recog-
nised them. They were known as Bill and Butch,
and were physically almost exact opposites of
each other. Bill was tall and slim. H e had pale
skin and very black, gleaming, long hair which
was swept out of his face. H e w a s offensively
good-looking. Butch w a s shorter and stockier.
His face had been savaged by acne, leaving
prominent scars o n his cheeks and still lingering
around his mouth and o n his forehead. His hair
had been shaved off a n d w a s only just re-
emerging in the form of a brown dusting on his
scalp. Bill was carrying the air rifle.
"That's assault, y o u bastards," shouted Dan.
He was dismayed to hear that his voice w a s
shaking.
Bill and Butch came towards them. M a r c o
and Ron still had their hands over their injuries.
Bill walked u p to Dan and stopped half a foot in
front of him. H e bent d o w n until their noses
almost touched and then said, very softly, "just
watch how you address your betters".

"Leave us alone," said Z e d , w h o h a d taken

Bill turned to him and was about to take a
step towards h i m when Ron spoke.
"What have we done to you?" He asked. Dan
closed his eyes and wished himself a long way
away. ,

everything else out of his consciousness, i cans
ing it like a fire. Dan didn't try to stop i i . It was
beautiful somehow, delfciously frighteninc 1
had never felt anger like r"n 1
• , re and sud-
denly he was looking Ron in the eyes. He willed
Ron to .feel the sameJ^QJfdrfrik his anger, to
infect him, a n d that is iSactly what happened.
For the rest of his life, even though he never:
mentioned it to anyone, he truly believed thai
this is what happened. Dan would become
scientist, to his own mild surprise, but h e haftf
always been a rational thinker. What happened
in that moment was not rational. In his later life
it would embarrass him to think about it, or even
contemplate what happened, so much so that
he eventually managed to block it out of his
mind. What he believed was that somehow, for
one fleeting instant, his and Ron's mind touched
and that during this moment he was sucked
bare; in the next moment his mind felt as empty
as a vacuum.
Ron took one step forward and began to
reach for the spade. Bill calmly levelled the gun
at him from the waist.
"Watch it, moron, or I might just have to
remove your last brain cell."
Ron picked up the spade. Butch shuffled
uncomfortably. Dan calmly took in everything.
He was thinking like a machine; there was no
fear, no hate, no anger. H e knows he can't
shoot Ron at this range, he thought, from over
by the hedge the pellet wasn't going to d o much
damage, just leave a bruise. But from this dis-
tance it's going to puncture the skin and'll have
to be removed surgically. H e could tell that Bill
w i s thinking furiously, even though his face was
as expressionless as ever.
Ron very slowly began to raise she spade; he
was standing about six feet from Bill and Holding
its shaft halfway up with both hands. ^Dan was
aware of Zed's and M a r c o ' s breathing beside
him; it was quick and shallow.
"Er, Bill-" began Butch.
Bill ignored him. "Drop the spade, dude," he
said gently. Ron was still raising it. Its shaft was
parallel to the ground. Bill w a s pointing the gun
at Ron's thigh when he pulled the trigger.
A fraction:
iW:S\ Second before the gun gave
its mechanical cough, Ron m o v e d the spade

lessly deflected, There is no way that Ron could

Dan, he m o v e d before the shot w a s fired; he
anticipated it. Bill grabbed the bairel of the gun
with both hands and set it swinging in an arc
that w o u l d connect with, Ron's head. With an
almost supernaturally fast motion Ron raised the
spade u p t o his f a c e ' a r i l B p r n l e s s l y gathered up
tl e rifle's blow, then using the m o m e n t u m he-
had gained from the gun he slashed Bill across
the faeeeyvith the blade of the spade in one fluid
movement. Bill sank to his knees making a kind

Bill's head. The stroke w a s short but powerful.
N o time wasted, just getting right d o w n to busi-
ness. Like a natural. Bill died.
Butch overcame his paralysis a n d started
running, he almost tripped, but made it. Ron
didn't notice. H e w a s still laying into Bill, with
that same alien mindless, efficiency. After a full
minute he stopped. Bill was unrecognisable. Ron
turned towards Z e d . still holding the dripping
tool. Zed hitched in breath to scream, but noth-
ing came out, just a dry, choked cough.
Ron dropped the spade and without turning
back began to run across the field. M a r c o was
standing very still, his eyes firmly shut. Zed tried
to take off his glasses but his hands were shak-
ing so much that he d r o p p e d them. Dan was
watching Ron, running away into the distance.
His movements were s m o o t h and cat-like, for-
eign, like something from another world.
