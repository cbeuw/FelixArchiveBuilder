Only three months after the last
round of elections, IC students
are being called to vote once
more. Four one-year-long union
jobs are available, for which stu-
dents are invited to run for elec-
tion.
Sabbatical elec- ,
tion papers have
now been up a week,
and four candidates
have so far put up
their names. Simon
Cooper (Composites
Postgraduate) a n d
David Hellard
( C o m p u t i n g / M a t h s
II) are running for
D e p u t y President
(Clubs &. Societies)
and ICU President
respectively. Neither Situations Vacant
candidate has a pro-
poser as Felix w a s
going to press. Felix learned on
W e d n e s d a y that Jon Lambert, ICU
Council Chair, would also be stand-
ing for ICU President but has yet to
sign up. "I've got a lot out of the
union for my four years here," he
told Felix, "And it's something I
want to do." H e seemed sanguine
that there would not be a repeat of
last year's triple-election rounds.
"Most of that after the first round
w a s people seeing what w o u l d
happen, and they d i d . " H e felt that
his biggest challenge was "a whole
load of medical students on c a m -
pus, and we're stretched enough as
it is." Mr.Lambert had yet to find a
proposer or seconders, but said
that "it was in the pipeline."
Two candidates are running for
Felix Editor; Alok Jha (Physics IV)
and Ed Sexton (Biology III). Both
have been proposed and the latter
is fully s e c o n d e d . N o one has
signed up for Deputy President
(Finances Services).
A n d y H e e p s , ICU President,
stated that the rules and regula-
tions governing the elections would
be available from him this after-
noon (Friday 30 January), and has
stated that the m a x i m u m a candi-
date may spend on publicity will be
£ 8 0 . He also expressed a desire to
change the format of the ICU
Hustings (Monday 16 February) to
allow more debating and question-
ing between the candidates.
O n the subject of N e w Election,
running for all posts, Andy Heeps
explained that it was only there for
students dissatisfied with all the
the four current sabbatical incumbents
sitting pretty Photo: Virginia
candidates, and that it shouldn't be
run as a campaign. Last year saw
the presidency remaining vacant in
the M a r c h 1997 voting; despite
two extra rounds of elections the
voters still chose N e w Election. The
top job was only filled in November
by Andy Heeps, forcing his prede-
cessor, Eric Allsop into a term of
office of record length in order to
administer the belated polling. "If
you don't like a candidate, then run
against t h e m , " M r .
H e e p s suggested,
|fj| expressing his hope
that many students
w o u l d consider stand-
ing for positions. In
conclusion he said he
wanted "a g o o d , clean
fight."
Prospective candi-
dates must sign up by
6 p m on Friday 6
February, on the papers
on the first floor of the
union building just
outside.the ICU office.
Hustings are on 16, 18
9 February, with voting in all
and

Imperial College Boat Club has
been awarded £ 7 0 3 , 5 0 0 to sup-
port a major overhaul of its
Putney training site. The
National Lottery Sports Fund has
assigned the money to the club on
a conditional basis; the contribu-
tion is presented as part of a c o n -
tractual agreement that details the
standards and objectives of the
project.
The illustrious boat club is
ranked amongst the top 5 in the
country with its w o m e n winning 3
Henley titles last year and the men
reaching the finals in 3 categories.
The club, often viewed as inacces-
sible to the uninitiated, boasts a
n u m b e r of former IC novices
amongst its international athletes.
The Putney boathouse project
will result in larger ladies changing
rooms, new kitchen facilities, gym,
a w o r k s h o p and a physiotherapy
r o o m as well as 8 study bedrooms
which will be preferentially offered
to the boat club's student commit-
tee members. O n completion this
year, the new facilities will be
available to local schools and
W a n d s w o r t h leisure groups.
The club captain Jules
Davenport referred to the grant as
an "exciting development", adding
that it provides an excellent
opportunity for the "pre-eminence
of the club to be i m p r o v e d " .
