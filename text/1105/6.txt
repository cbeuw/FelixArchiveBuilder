STEAK PUDDING
After the recent healthy dishes, I think we
should have something a little bit more solid
this week. Steak pudding is just steak and kid-
ney pudding without the kidneys because
they're yukky and horrible to play around
with. If y o u insist on kidneys then be my
guests and bung them in, 1 won't say a
word.
N o w , the only way to make a g o o d pud-
ding is to use suet. The beef type is unques-
tionably the tastiest (and is made from the
fat surrounding the kidneys so there's
another weird connection for y o u . I bet the
FBI are into this up to their cheesy armpits)
but for the health-conscious out there, veg-
etable suet (which, like margarine, is made
from hydrogenated vegetable oil whose
health credentials are being questioned at
the moment) produces more or less the
right consistency.
So here we go. I know, w h y not start
with a list of necessary ingredients:
<*" 1 Vi lb stewing steak
<*' 1 onion
* Suet pastry - 8 o z plain flour, 4 o z suet
(shredded or chop it yourself)
1 tsp baking powder
®' 1 pudding bowl, should be ceramic
Gosh! Complicated isn't it? N o w time to get
mucky.
M i x the flour, suet, baking powder and a
pinch of salt in a large bowl, crushing the pieces
of suet between your fingers to incorporate the
flour. O n c e the texture is fairly consistent add
just enough cold water to get everything to stick
together and form a firm dough. Leave to chill.
Meanwhile, cut the meat into thin strips and
dip into some seasoned flour (flour plus any
powdered spices you might have: pepper,
mace, mustard, paprika, whatever).
Take the dough and divide it into 2/3 and
1/3. Roll the larger piece into a round about 'A
in. thick and line your greased pudding
bowl with it. Press the dough all around
and make sure there aren't any creases
which could p o p up and spoil the effect.
Half fill the bowl with the meat
strips.
C h o p the onion finely and fry it in
some butter until lovely and golden
brown, adding a hefty dose of pepper
near the end. Place the onion in the
pudding bowl with the meat, deglaze
the pan with half a glass of water and
add this juice too. Then put the rest of
the beef in with a g o o d pinch of salt.
Finally, roll out the remaining pastry
into a round slightly larger than the
bowl, moisten the edges, place on top
and press the edges together well.
To cook your cardiac arrest in a dish,
wrap it up in a teacloth or two and place
in a large saucepan with enough water
to c o m e 2/3 of the way up the pudding bowl.
Boil for 3 hours.

O h c o m e o n , y o u must be able to think of something...
H
aving a column is great.
There really is nothing
quite like the privilege of
being able to air my t w i s t e d ,
bizarre and s o m e t i m e s merely
insane views o n any subject I
choose. Estimates indicate that our
beloved student newspaper is read
by approximately eight thousand
people, giving me the potential
opportunity to take a step towards
shaping the minds of the future. Of
course, 1 don't bother doing this,
preferring to m o a n , w h i n e a n d
whinge about whatever has
scratched me during that particular
week.
This time, however, the cre-
ative half of my brain looks to be
enjoying a little siesta. It s e e m s
that the bloke sitting up there w h o
provides my inspiration has been
kidnapped by a crack suicide squad
from the other half of my brain,
who are going to tie him up and
torture him by forcing him to learn
the Taylor Series Expansion.
Unfortunate though this is, it has
left me with the more immediate
problem of a column space that is
so depressingly white it would eas-
ily pass the Daz d o o r s t e p
Challenge.
I decided to take the afternoon
off, planning to use it to regain
some of the sleep 1 lost last night
when two of my cruel flatmates
forced me to play W o r m s 2 until
the small hours. (They made m e d o
it. Honestly...) Instead I find myself
walking up and d o w n the Felix
office, watching the usual suspects
c o m e and go, and suffering from a
very severe case of writer's block.
A s the afternoon draws on, and the
editor's gaze darkens, I try many
different ideas for subject matter,
with no success. I refuse to bend
under office-wide pressure; I will
not write about the bloody sabbat-
ical elections.
So I apologise for the lack of a
depressing, heavily sardonic and
misery-inducing piece this week.
