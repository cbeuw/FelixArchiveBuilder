1 did not realise looking at the
play listings how many true classics
there are on this compilation. I did
not know the names, but as soon
as I listened to this C D I recognised
tune after tune, from back in the
days when I just called everything
Hardcore and y o u ' d get Techno
Trance tracks played along side
Drum & Bass tracks.
There are some massive tunes
from the early rave scene o n here,
CLUBSCENE - SINGLES
such as D-Shake's Techno Trance,
G T O ' s Pure (energy), B-Sides
Magic Orchestra, Fierce Ruling
Diva's Rubb It In, Quadrophonia's
Quadrophonia, S e c o n d Phase
M a n t a s m , CLS Can You Feel It, to
name but a few.
As y o u progress through the C D
things get more up to date with
tracks such as the almost timeless
The Age O f Love - The Age Of Love,
Adfahrt: Come Into My Life and
M a r i m o n ' s Schoneberg. So this is a
collection of some of the biggest
tunes over the past seven years,
many of which y o u ' d have a job
trying to find on 12".
So for those vinyl junkies out
there, the vinyl pack is a bargain, as
this really is full of classics. Not like
today, where every new release is
hailed as a classic before it has
even sold a copy. A n d for those of
y o u w h o went out raving in the
early 90s, there is plenty on here to
bring the memories flooding back.
A definitive collection of the
Techno Trance sounds since 91',
just showing how much influence
the React label has had over the
years, and they are still g o i n g
strong. Jo Public.
DJ KRUSH & TOSHINORI KONDO. (R&S)
T
his a l b u m brings t o g e t h e r
DJ Krush of J a p a n , a w e l l
r e s p e c t e d figure in the
H i p - H o p c o m m u n i t y a n d
T o s h i n o r i K o n d o , b o t h f r o m
Japan, a l e a d i n g figure in the
Jazz s c e n e a n d a p r o f e s s i o n a l
t r u m p e t e r s i n c e l e a v i n g s c h o o l .
S o w e h a v e a h i p - h o p - j a z z
f u s i o n t h i n g g o i n g o n .
DJ Krush once again delivers a
wicked assortment of cold chilling
beats, breaks and scratching, true
hip-hop flavours as always. This
has a very strong jazz flavour,
which is sometimes too m u c h for
me, but it all blends together very
well.
M U - C H U slows the pace from
hip-hop to a more d o w n - b e a t
tempo, a totally laid back number,
with a various array of sounds used
to soothe the soul, and the trum-
peting skills of Kondo used to full
advantage.
The pace is lifted again quickly
with FU-YU, a head-nodding foot-
tapping, funky h i p - h o p thing, I
found the trumpeting a bit too
over-powering, slightly spoiling it.
The pace is slowed again with
S H O H - K A , mellowing things out,
with the slow rolling beats.
BU-SEKI finishes things off in a
fine style, excellent scratching 8.
manipulation of records, strong
crisp beats, but once again, for me
to m u c h jazzy trumpeting. Which
you may have noticed by now.
I found that the more down-
beat tracks worked the better, than
the faster h i p - h o p style tunes.
M a y b e this is simply due to the
trumpeting being not so over-
whelming and intrusive as with the
faster tracks.
It's a shame they went for such
a full-on jazz direction, instead of
some of the tracks having a jazz
influence, all the tracks are well and
truly jazzed up. 1 must say it sur-
prised me just how jazz up this
album is, after hearing much of DJ
Krush's previous work.
This album s e e m to be aimed
at jazz lovers more than hip-hop /
breakbeat lovers.

EXPERIMENTAL T E C H N O h o u s e w g a r a g e
Finitribe
Frantic Remixes (Infectious)
The C D boasts a wider range of remixes to the
vinyl. The sad thing is that I prefer them all to the
original. From the menacing drum'n'bass sound-
scape conjured up by Scissorkicks tot he dreamy
dubby downbeat creation of Cut La Roc; from
some acidic old skool electro by A l people to to
loads of crazy beakbeats from M i c r o s p e e c h ;
from the murky depths of Witchman's haunting
downbeat adventure to some blunted hip-hop
breaks by Laidback. There is something here for
everyone but the purist.
Ryuichi Sakamoto
Anger/Grief remixes (Ninja Tunes)
A prelude to the veteran Japanese composer's
album of modern instrumental music, this ep
boasts some of the wildest musical experiments
that I have ever witnessed. A m o n Tobin creates
a viciously dark drum'n'bass piece out of Grief
that left me breathless. Anger has been included
in its original form, a confused barrage of sound
that hits the listener from all angles. The remix-
es include fierce breakbeats from Rare Force, an
undescribable "Orchestra vs sampler" contest
from Chocolate Force (aka T-Power) and Talvin
Singh's amazing tabla'n'bass effort, a pacy piece
of genius. They say anger drives and inspires the
best of a breed. Here's the evidence...
Orlando Voorn presents the Stalker
Blast EP. pt 2 (Fierce!)
Released Feb.
Part 1 features mixes by Freddie Fresh. This EP
boasts the production talents of Soma's Funk
D'Void. His interpretation of Blast is character-
istic of his sound; smooth, deep and harmonic.
M y favourite tracks are those offered by
Orlando on the flipside (Phunk=Phunk and
Burning Passion). Both are abstract, quirky and
yet extremely danceable pieces of music.
Lee Grainge
Island Life EP (Human)
Three stunning tracks on the debut outing for
this label. Evil Knevil creates a big atmospheric
sound; an electronic collage that will fire up
your imagination. Winter is a softer ambient
piece. Skating on Thin Ice is a lovingly-crafted
offering, deeper than the first two. It is obvious
from this ep that melody and m o o d are impor-
tant to Lee. M u s i c like this doesn't often appear
so don't waste your chance.
Ultratubes vs Pierre
Horspielmusik 03 (Horspielmusik)
Four tracks with unpronouncably long German
names. However the music is great! You'll find
hard techno with strange frequencies wiggling
around, rhythmic electro, minimal funk and
cybersonic craziness. Check this out.
Gus Gus. Sasha mix.
Polyesterday Out Now.
Sasha gives this tune the deep- breakbeaty
house treatment, plenty of time-stretches,
echoing vocals &. strong break-beats. This track
also has a trancey feel to it, but not as hard as I
would have expected from Sasha, it never really
seems to get going, just rolls along. Not really a
floor burner, more of a pleasant journey.
Marco Zaffarano. The Band.
(Silver Planet). Out Now.
The W a y Out West mix is truly great, the best
work they've done in a while in my opinion. They
have transformed the track into a wicked break
beat affair, almost sounds D&J3 at first, but goes
in perfectly with a standard house tune. Clever
drum patterns, squelchy sounds, stretched b-
lines, time-stretches, tight precessions and
trancey tendencies. Totally refreshing.
Beanfield
Electro-Kraut remixes Vol I (Compost)
Will these remixes spoil an already great piece of
music? In the capable hands of two lans we
have two top quality tracks. M r Pooley smooths
away the edges, leaving a slick piece of early
morning house music. M r O'Brien injects his
quirky breed of electronic jazz, and maintains
the depth. Also check the D M X Crew for a mel-
low piece of subtle electro. Al;ck
