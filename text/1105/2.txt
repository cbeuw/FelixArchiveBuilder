Tory Rebel Speaks Out N e w s i n Brief...
ANDY SINHARAY
IC's Conservative Society played
host to )ohn Wilkinson, MP for
Ruislip North, on Wednesday. In
a half-hour long talk the former
RAF Pilot, who first entered poli-
tics nearly thirty years ago,
expounded his views on Europe, a
matter which he described as
"close to my heart".
He had voted against the then-
Conservative Government on the
Maastricht M o t i o n in 1992, a n d
had the w h i p r e m o v e d after
abstaining on the Second Reading
of the EC Finance Bill in 1994. M r .
Wilkinson said that after the Danish
anti-Maastricht vote, he had been
compelled to read the Treaty for
himself, w h i c h he felt m a d e
demands on the nation which had
not been presented to the votes at
the last election. "It was a dawn
raid," he said. He also spoke of the
"awful experience of losing a gener-
al election... [which was due] to
our inability to c o m e clean to the
voters" on European policy. "I felt
defeat was inevitable," he a d d e d ,
saying he felt the Referendum Party
was right to call for a nation-wide
ballot on monetary union.
M r . Wilkinson went onto say
that although the present govern-
ment realises the UK economy is
out of phase with the rest of
Europe, he said he was happier
with the current Tory line on the
matter under Hague than under
Major. In general he felt that closer
European integration was expen-
sive, not merely financially but also
in terms of both power and sover-
eignty. The C o m m o n Agricultural
Policy, he said, was an "interna-
tional scandal... rigged, crooked,
fraudulent... the EU runs the most
highly protectionist policy to keep
prices artificially high." This worked
against trade with the former
C o m m u n i s t states and the
Developing World. Smaller states
were better, he felt, as the voters
were closer to their elected repre-
sentatives. But in spite of what
many consider to be Euro-sceptical
views, he added that his objections
were principally towards European
integration in present form. H e
closed with the remark, "We have a
vision of a community of states
w h i c h accords better with our
interests, their interests and the
principles of democracy w e hold
dear."

A team from Imperial has w o n a
national competition organised by
the Young Entrepreneurs Scheme
(YES), which aims to teach y o u n g
scientists h o w to deal with
investors and the City. Each team
in the competition had to submit a
realistic business plan, and the best
two of each region were given the
chance to convince a panel of
judges of their suitability to run a
c o m p a n y . The IC team, InCap
Technologies, consisted of Sarah
Cant, Viola Stoll, Kian H e n g Ng,.
Alan Tang and Leonor Galvao, w h o
patented an insulin pill after con-
ducting research in America, Israel
and the UK. InCap was selected as
one of the best two in the region,
and were sent to the Department
of Trade and Industry for the finals.
Here, they presented their ideas
and business plans alongside five
other finalists, and w o n overall.
The Managing Director, Sarah Cant,
told Felix that the whole experience
had been extremely useful and
worthwhile, adding that she and
her company had learnt a lot about
all areas of industry.

King's College L o n d o n have
allowed a society based on the
"appreciation of the art of the
human form" to be ratified by their
Sports and Societies Board. The
'Gentlemen's Viewing Society' is
open to "all the members of King's,
of all sex, race and religion", but is
thought by s o m e to be an excuse
to watch hard core pornographic
films. The Society has denied all
allegations of being involved with
porn, stating that they will run an
historical course including exami-
nations. King's Sports and Soci-
eties Board ratified the society,
with those in favour including the
President of the Jewish Society and
the head of the Christian Union.
Students Driven Mad Gas a Deadly Danger
JULIA HARRIES
A report in the Guardian this
week claimed that 35% of acade-
mics have dealt with students
with mental health problems.
The survey, commissioned by the
funding council's 'Special Initiative
to Encourage High Quality
Provision for Students with
Learning Difficulties and
Disabilities,' was carried out at Hull
University.
M a n y respondents were aware
of their o w n limitations in dealings
with mentally ill students. It had
been noticed that many students,
especially foreigners, are not keen
on consulting university counsel-
lors, since that would involve an
admission of problems which they
feel unable to deal with. M a n y are
also afraid that such an admission
may affect their progress or refer-
ences. The confidentiality of coun-
selling services can infuriate teach-
ing staff, keen to monitor student
progress and to see what support
is needed. Often, it is friends w h o
are the first to notice problems like
anorexia and bulimia. M o r e prob-
lems arise when students refuse to
allow families to be informed, as
staff feel they cannot give support
without parental back-up. Another
potential problem lies in GPs not
having patient case histories.
W h e n moving to university and
changing GPs, records are slow to
transfer to the new G P , leaving
them unaware of past mental prob-
lems. GPs often provide access to
other specialist mental health ser-
vices. Academics' realisation of
their inexperience provokes
demands for greater pastoral care.
The research shows the need for
universities to redefine their wel-
fare provision, and to ensure that
academics have enough resources
to properly help students. The
researchers c o m m e n t e d "We are a
long way from achieving an atmos-
phere in which mental problems
can be... effectively addressed".

Students are being urged to
check faulty gas appliances.
According to the National Union
of Students, ten deaths have
occurred in student houses in
recent years, due to the inhala-
tion of carbon monoxide from
faulty equipment. Students in pri-
vately-rented a c c o m m o d a t i o n are
believed to be particularly at risk as
the N U S alleges that dishonest
landlords, claiming to have safe
boilers and heaters in order to
avoid repair costs, have been
responsible for student deaths. The
winter weather encourages stu-
dents to spend more time indoors
and deaths are the most prevalent
at this time of year. "Late January
and early February is the peak
time," an N U S source told Felix.
"We always take this very seri-
ously," said Martin T h o m s o n ,
Union Advisor at ICU. All landlords,
he said are legally required to
prove that all gas equipment has
been declared safe within the last
I 2 months, and the N U S in partic-
ular has requested that "all stu-
dents should make sure they see
this certificate now, or call the gas
safety action line. " M r . Thomson
also urged students to check that
any faulty appliances had been
checked, though to his knowledge
there had been no serious inci-
dents involving Imperial students
and faulty heating. M r . Thomson
told Felix that though people have
been c o n c e r n e d about carbon
monoxide levels where detectors
have picked it up, "I thankfully
haven't c o m e across anyone being
ill due to carbon monoxide poison-
ing... w e d o have posters and
leaflets available in the union
office," he said, and he added that
anyone worried about the issue is
w e l c o m e to discuss the matter
with him. M r . Thomson can be
reached on x 4 8 0 6 7 . The gas safety
action line can be called free on
