Andy Heeps
ICU President
-On August I st. Imperial
College permanently
changed. We stand on
the brink of a new cen-
tury, a century where
the world's leading sci-
entists, engineers and
doctors will all come
from Imperial College.
This change is good.
Good for ICU and good
for the Constituent
College Unions, as it
provides the perfect
opportunity for us to get
what we, as a collective
whole student body,
need. However, this can
only be done if wc put
dogma and previous dis-
agreements behind us.
Fresh momentum, fresh
ideas and fresh initiatives
can unite the student
body agamst the useless
bureaucracy that exists
within Sherfield, and get
results.
These fresh ideas will
not come from any old
'Union hack'. The
strength of ICU that cur-
rently exists needs a
fresh face to provide
strong leadership and
prepare the Union for
the many tough deci-
sions that lie ahead. A
new broom is required
to sweep the cobwebs
away, and to concen-
trate the work of ICU in
the areas where you
want it to be directed,
not where a clique of
CV-tillcrs think it would
be best placed. ICU
should be inclusive, not *
exclusive, and provide a
service, not prove to be
a hindrance.
As President. I will make
it my priority to ensure
that ICU provides you
with the services you
want. I don't want to see
a Union divided, which
puts Club against
Society, and Constituent
College against
Constituent College. I
want a Union where my
voice makes a differ-
ence, my opinions
count, and my needs as a
student of the country's
leading college of
Science. Technology and
Medicine are met. I want
this for you.
This isn't some flash-in-
the-pan bid for glory, I'm
going to be at Imperial
for a good time to come,
and I want to see ICUy*
work whilst I'm here. /
Can you describe your job?
Although effectively 'the boss',
mys job is more akin to that of a
puppet-master - keeping ail the
strings together, and making the
Union move as a coherent single
entity. Also the 'ultimate represen-
tative' of the Union, any
Presidential hopeful should have a
macabre passion for committees,
because they take up half your
time in the job. The President is
also ultimately responsible for
absolutely everything that goes on
within the Union, from its finances
and staffing to elections of Officers
and making the office coffee in
times of stress.
Not really as glamorous as it
seems, the President is also the
first point of contact for whining
members of the public, moaning
professors and disenchanted
directors of Estates, but in the end
it's all worth it because you really
can make a difference.
Do you think you've fufilled the
promises made in your mani-
festo?
The promises I made were really
year-long promises, nothing short
term, and I'm well on the way to
achieving what I set out to
achieve.
How do you feel about taking a year
out of your studies?
This was the hardest descision to
make actually, especially as 1 was
coming away from the campus i
was familiar with. But, then, lVe
got another four years to go, so it
doesn't really feel as if it's going to
make that much difference really.
Have you enjoyed the job so far?
90% of the time, yes I have. Of
course, there are times when I feel
1 just want to walk away from it all,
but then, everyone feels like that
sometimes. 1 a m generally happy
with my job.
What advice can you give to anyone
thinking of signing up?
People really shouldn't look on the
sabbactical year as a fill-in job. I
think the two most important rea-
sons to do the job is to make a dif-
ference to the Union, and to pro-
vide services. If you want a easy
year out, go travelling around
India, go to Africa, dont be a sabb.

Deputy Pres. (Finance & Services)
stop
mfht. strcr
•uring my four years at
Imperial 1 have noticed
that there has been a
steady decline in the
numbers of students
taking full advantage of
all the available facilities
offered by Imperial
College Union, Many
students automatical!)'
assume the Union will
always be there to
finance the clubs they
join, and provide the
services that they take
for granted. The recent
loss of the Union Book
Store to Watcrstones
shows how quickly a
Union trading outlet can
be suddenly replaced,
overturning many years
hard work by staff and
students committed to
ensuring that the best
possible service and
widest range of stock
are provided. I intend to
stop this trend by
strengthening the
Union's trading position
within College.
Increasing awareness of
exactly what the Union
has to offer students, so
that every member
understands the need
for a strong and finan-
cially independent
Union is also a high pri-
ority.experience I have
gained while running IC
Radio and being a mem-
ber of Union Finance
Committee,
Publications Board and
House Committee, puts
me in a strong position
to understand
Union finances,
the course of my
degree I have also
worked for an industrial
research lab preparing
laboratory test rigs and
assisting in the tendering
process for contracts.
Additionally in the five
months before
Christmas of this year I
was working as part of a
scientific sales team
with responsibilities for
technical support, fore-
casting, market research
and various other
aspects of customer
support and sales. 1
believe that over the
last 4 years I have
gained the experience
to do the job of Deputy
President (Finance and
Services) well and I
hope f will receive
support.

Sadly, Rob Clark couldn't be
arsed to write us a job
description. We were, howev-
er, able to keep him still long
enough to ask him these
questions:
Do you think you've fulfilled the
promises made in your mani-
festo?
1 deliberately didn't promise
anything in my manifesto, but
yes, I think I've done as m u c h
as any sabb.
Have you enjoyed the job so far?
Yes, 1 have enjoyed it. i've
found it very hard work, but it's
been very fulfiling.
What advice can you give to any-
one thinking of signing up?
The best advice I can give is to
remember you're a link in a
chain, and y o u must allow peo-
ple to carry your work o n .
You've got to be able to pass on
information, so that things
keep going.
The DP(F&S)'s main
role is financial.
They are responsible
for all the money spent by the
union (about £ 2 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 a
year), a responsibility which
consists mainly of preventing
anyone from spending it.
The services of the Union
bars, catering, advice,
minibuses etc. also come
under their remit. The combi-
nation of these two branches
results in them spending
most of their life in some
committee or another.
The DP (F&S) is also expected
to keep a general eye on the
union, hold the fort while the
president's mind is on higher
things, and to do their best to
prevent College from pinching
any more rooms.

Jeremy Thomson
Felix Editor
Tell me about your job.
It seems more like a hundred
jobs than one, most of the
time. Put simply, I have to
ensure that a decent newspa-
per hits the streets every Friday.
To d o this I need to be an edi-
tor, a writer, a designer, a per-
sonnel manager, an advertising
manager, a DTP expert, pur-
chasing manager, director, sec-
retary, print manager, comput-
er tamer, p o s t m a n , union
'hack', bin-emptier and hardest
of all, a one-man complaints
department. All this would drive
anyone insane, but I've also got
to try to remain c a l m a n d
friendly to avoid scaring off
contributors, and acting is not a
strong point.
Have you fulfiled the promises
you made in your manifesto?
Let me have a look at it... A h , it
appears to be a complete load
of wank. That'll be a yes, then.
Have you enjoyed the job so far?
In patches. I've always been a
bit of a slacker, so working sev-
enty or eighty hours a week
isn't really my cup of tea. The
job can also get highly stressful
if you let it - your responsibili-
ties are e n o r m o u s and the
deadlines are always looming.
O n the other hand, I've
achieved a lot and it's g o o d to
know I'm working for a g o o d
cause, not myself.
What advice can you give to any-
one thinking of signing up?
Think hard. The job is highly
traumatic, and if y o u can't
cope, you're very likely to suffer

tion manifesto. You're

INFORM
Great change is
o imminent at IC.
Whole departments and
campuses are shifting in
the largest develop-
ments since the 1960s.
There is opportunity,
but also risk that the
needs and wishes of the
students and their union
will be further margin-
alised, I believe Felix has
a duty to inform - so
you know about the
decisions that affect
your life, and your opin-
ions will be heard.
If you've got this far, 1
suppose you really are
interested. In that
case...
I want greater student
involvement. Felix has a
great deal to offer stu-
dents directly. It pro-
vides opportunity for
aspiring writers, pho-
tographers, designers,
reviewers and colum-
nists to sec their work
in print. It offers experi-
ence in finance, adver-
tising, and research. It
has excellent production
facilities. It's a diverse
social centre. Plus, it's
the perfect place to eat
your lunch-time curry.

don't care about), and severely,
or perhaps permanently d a m -

do).
The real skill of the job lies in
getting on well with your staff. I
am responsible for motivating
unpaid, voluntary students to
do the work of ten or fifteen
full-time professionals.
G o o d luck!
Charlie Joynt
Deputy President (Clubs & Socs)
So, what do you do, then?
H m m m . I'm ultimately respon-
sible for the running of the
Union's many clubs and soci-
eties. With most of the admin-
istration duties borne by the
C&S Administrator, the bulk of
the work is regarding develop-
ment strategies and represent-
ing the Union Clubs and
Societies to College. Health and
Safety, student training, provi-
sion of sports, giving advice -
the list goes on - it's all in a day's
work.
Do you think you've fufilled the
promises made in your
manifesto?
So far, yes, 1 think I have. We're
working on an A C C ball,
amongst other things, but of
course, I won't really be able to
say for sure until I've left the job.
How do you feel about taking a
year out?
Fine. In my case it was an easy
decision. It's given me far more
enthusiasm for my course, as
I've had time to take a serious
look at things, and put them in
perspective. People w h o are
keener on their courses than I
was will probably find it more
difficult to make the break. I'm
pleased to have done this, and
I'm glad that I'll be here to see
things go through, and to give
any help to my sucessor.
Have you enjoyed the job so far?
Yes, certainly. I've been busy, but
the work is absorbing and chal-
lenging.
What advice can you give to any-
one thinking of signing up?

^mosi of us choose to be

mergers of the medical
schools, and next year's inte-
gration of ICSM into the
South Kensington campus, we
must strive to broaden the
width of the clubs on offer,
and to increase the depth of
participation in them.
Particularty as Imperial is a
science-based college, we
must encourage social and
artistic societies to maintain a
healthy balance of interests.
Many of our sports teams are
excellent, with international
caps for many of our rowers,
a BUSA win for fencing and
individual championship wins
for members of the Karate
club, to mention but three
teams. With proper coaching,
sponsorship deals, better
equipment and improved
sporting facilities, there is no

would suggest that anyone
thinking of signing up should
c o m e and see me to get an idea
of what they would have to do.
If you've read these interviews,
and think you might like to have
a go, the deadline to sign up is
Friday 6 February. The current
sabbs will be more than happy
to chat to you about the jobs,
as they're all rather hoping to
retire on ! August this year.
