M
akes little sense" said the
Luton N e w s after one
particular h o m e t o w n gig.
You can see where they are c o m i n g
from to be honest. His introverted,
childish yet surreal and probing
comic verse is generally viewed as
utterly bizarre, like an Guardian
reader's Ivor Cutler.
From French knock-knock jokes
(Frappe-frappe. Qui est la? Jean.
Jean qui? Gendarme) to observa-
tions from his childhood (My father
always told my sister that she
shouldn't play with her food. He
said that carrots do not make very
good friends) and searching,
pleading poetry, his styles subjects
are diverse to say the least, from
his gentle love of potatoes to his
declarations on religion and quirky
tales of unrequited love. As a per-
former, he is as you might expect,
nervous, awkward though through-
out retaining control, and he is
endearingly unafraid to make a fool
out of himself; able to carry the
flopped line with a muttered
excuse w h i c h usually m a n a g e s
more of a laugh than the intended
punchline. Hegley meanders
around the stage, from the lip to a
lectern, on then to a blackboard on
which he charts his journey geo-
graphically as he describes his life
story in verse and song, accompa-
nied by the ever deadpan Nigel on
the Portuguese guitar. A brief
attempt at improvisation left him
floundering just before the break,
but he coasted the second half
after a slide show of his simple,
hilarious line drawings and novelty
potato items. A lot of material was
from his recent c o m p e n d i u m
Family Pack, including classics like
The Difference Between Dogs and
Sheds, The Play and Coming Home
For Christmas, but he also d e m o n -
strated a g o o d amount of new
works. His regular appearances on
M a r k Radcliffe's old Radio 1
evening show ensured a fairly full
theatre, but 1 feel that both he and
the audience w o u l d have benefited
from a more intimate venue.
S h o w n the appreciation he
deserves, Hegley can charm and
delight. H e didn't quite pull it off at
the Bloomsbury, but he was still al-
right. Apologies...

SIGHTINGS - NEW
PHOTOGRAPHIC ART
Institute of Contemporary Arts
G
o and see this presentation
by a new generation of
artists from around the
globe. All sorts of avenues are
explored and a range of influences
are apparent. S o m e of the artists
have enhanced their work using the
c o m p u t e r technology w h i c h is
becoming a trademark of the ICA.
This has been interwoven with tra-
ditional landscape scenes to create
a truly contemporary snapshot.
It is a little annoying to find
only a few exhibits from each artist;
Especially when some of the work
is obviously from a wider series
(and it's good).
As you walk around the display
panel in the "Lower Gallery", y o u
are confronted with a piece by Paul
Seawright; huge, filthy hands, clear
down to the smallest wrinkle. This
British photographer manages to
create allure out of his seemingly
harrowing subject of streetlife. The
immense scope of this exhibition
allows pieces such as this to be
viewed next to work inspired by
Alice in Wonderland, with a slightly
twisted edge of course, after all
this is modern art.
Several of the artists have
decided to use human subjects,
Esko Mannikko's "Mexas series" is
one example which illustrates the
poverty and disorder that can be
found in America. O n the other
hand, themes such as the continu-
ation of life are also apparent in the
same pieces.
There is also a whole wall ded-
icated to a study of icebergs, and
the series entitled "Attempting to
deal with time and space" will
make y o u laugh even if you don't
want to stop and ponder.
Although y o u c o u l d s p e n d
hours in this gallery, trying to
understand every significance of
each photograph. M a n y of the
studies are interesting at just one
glance and they encourage at least
a minute or two of contemplation.
With a few exceptions, these artists
have managed to avoid the preten-
tious contrasts of s o m e modern
artists and the result is a neat
exhibition.

T
he new exhibition in the ante
room gallery is about a mil-
lion times better than the
previous one. This is the best thing
I can say about it. Sure, it's very
pretty, but is it ART?
The exhibition really is c o m -
pletely innocuous stuff, consisting
of s o m e geometric patterns, pho-
tographs of bird-cages with light
shining behind them, more pho-
tographs this time of fossils, all the
sort of thing that y o u ' d expect to
see in a kitchen or a bathroom, not
an art gallery. It's very middle
class, tasteful art. 1 liked every-
thing, but only in a passive way.
It's not art, not really. It didn't
prompt any strong emotions or
reactions from me at all, which
surely is the point. At least "blan-
ket", the previous one, made me
cross. "Inside" is a fairly restful
exhibition, so if you've had a long
day, go in and gaze at the pictures,
and feel waves of inertia wash over
y o u . Otherwise, don't bother.

HOT MIKADO
CXWMS Light Opera Soc
A
nother perk of this job is the
ability to plug your friends'
productions. Hot Mikado
is a re-working of the Gilbert and
Sullivan original, with basically
everything changed except for the
plot, which is tortured and very
complicated. The music is in the
'50s/'60s rock style, with famous
songs such as "Three Little M a i d s
From School" scored to sound
more like the Beverly Sisters. If
you like musicals, this should be a
g e m . It's going to be very colour-
ful, with orange, pink and blue '40s
zoot suits. There'll be a review of it
in next week's issue, so watch out
for that, and d o go and see the
show, I'm sure it'll be great.
