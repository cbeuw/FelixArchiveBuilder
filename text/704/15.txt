Deputy President's report continuedfrom page 13
Governing Body/Finance & Executive
These committees consist of outside people who are the top body in
IC. Their meetings are useful for us, for although we are only
observers we are given plenty of chance to express our views and pin
down College officers on points we think are relevant. This is one of
our advantages when facing a hard timeâ€”we can draw on a good
question at these committees to show that someone is not pulling their
weight.
College House Committee
A most useful one. The highest admin committee. The members are
senior enough to ensure that only the truth comes out under
questioning. Although nothing major has been initiated this year it
provides a great opportunity to pin down those who are not pulling
their weight.
IC Bookshop
This is owned jointly by I C U and the CCUs. It has grown up from
being primarily a second-hand bookstall to a modern specialist
bookshop and stationers.
Unfortuanetly the management ofthe bookshop seems to be stuck
in a rut constrained by the level of staff and its sometimes myterious
relation to ICU. Hopefully the profit made by the Bookshop will
reoccur as a result of the changes made by the committee. The
sportshop is not proving to be a success even given the lean time until
profits will be realised, predicted by various predecessors. To succeed
it must gain more publicity to gain the turnover it needs to gain
profitability. A better site would do it no harm either.
STA
This year STA have proved themselves a competent firm in dealing
with our students. I have received no complaints from students about
them and Dick Porter has displayed great patience and understanding
when dealing with College cock-ups.
Estates Section
(See also house committee)
Due to the diligance of our accountants, this year we have been
presented with large bills some dating back to 1981-1982 before many
present stduents arrived at this College. Tracing back to the original
orders and quotes has been made more difficult and supporting
documentation seems to be hard to get out of Estates. We have in at
least two cases been reduced to the level of waiting for the D P of those
years deciphering the claims for us.
It is incredible that bills for several thousands of pounds can lie
unsent and ignored for so long. For us to plan any kind of expenditure
on this building we need to have bills quickly so that the people who
ordered the work can be around to inspect it and authorise the
payment to the contractors.
Finance Section
There are some people in this section who help us enormously. But
others do not seem to care that their handling of our officers and
accounts bring us great hassle and trouble. Many things have occured
mainly involving the Union accounts, where V A T seems to be
arbitrary and people going off sick seem not to be able to be replaced
to carry on for a week or so. Brian Llowd Davis and Terry Neville have
been particularly helpful this year in helping us with the snack bar and
bookshop.
General Thanks
Physics, for allowing me to pass a degree course. R C S U , for making
me into a hack. Chris Teller, for being helpful even after I'd been
elected. Ieaun Thomas for the late bar licences, and Eric, Ian, Dave,
Jen, Pat and Kathy for their friendship and support. I hope Dave,
Carl, and Quentin do as much as they can and all success to them.
