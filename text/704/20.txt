SINGLES
Duran Duran; View To A Kill
They must 'have made it;
they're recording a James
Bond theme? Whatever did
happen to Sheena Easton?!
No, seriously folks, this has
about as much melody as a
combine harvester on full
throttle. Exciting production
and good bass line hardly
make up for it either. C o m e
back Power Station—all is
forgiven.
Dennis Brown: Slow Down
Woman
This reminds me of something
but I can't quite put my finger
on it. Eric Clapton has been
suggested but I reckon it's
more like Eastwood and Saint.
Moody but with a soulful
r y t h y m — y o u c a n ' t h e l p
tapping your feet. If only good
reggae like this got the airplay
it deserves we'd all be buying
it—I might even remember
what it reminds me of.
Georgia Satellites: Keep the
faith
Described as a cross between
Dylan, Chuck Berry, Stray
Cats, George Jones (Who he,
Ed?) andZZTop,thepluggers
tell methisisthe most exciting
thing since Patrick Moore's
disertatiori on Halley's comet.
P e r s o n a l l y , I'll stick to
astronomy.
David Knopf ler: Heart to Heart
C o n s i d e r a b l e c h a n g e of
direction from the ex-Dire
Strait (or should it be straight
dire?). Moving up beat I have
to admit his voice grates
rather against the song—and
anyone who uses 'Bom bom
do pows' these days with
Charlenesque talkovers has
got to have something wrong.
The flip is more like his old
brilliant self, but it's not
commercial. Any which way
he loses.
Big Daddy: Hotel California
Their version of Dancing in
the Dark was good as well as
being fun. This certainly is
fun—I couldn't stop laughing.
What with the oombahs and
synth breaks this is probably
the best since the classic
Blood Transfusion of the
1970s.
Martin Bax leads a double life.
N o t u n u s u a l , p e r h a p s .
However, in both of his lives,
he is an editor. A s Dr Bax,
paediatrician, he is respon-
sible for a learned medical
journal; as Martin Bax, writer
of short stories and two
n o v e l s , he edits Ambit,
according to the Observer, 'a
sensible avanfe garde literary
magazine'.
Ambit, now in its 25th year,
is celebrating its 100th issue.
Its many famous contributors
include J G Ballard, Ivor
Cutler, Gavin Ewart, David
Hockney, Christoper Logue,
M i c h a e l M o o r c o c k , a n d
Eduardo Paolozzi.
After a quick sortie among
the Charing Cross Road
bookshops, I divined that
Ambit was sold at the Arts
Council Shop in Long Acre.
There, I managed to get hold
of what appeared to be the last
copy—thick as a paperback,
seemingly a snip at £3. Inside,
I learned that I might have
obtained it direct from 17
Priory Gardens, Highgate N6
for only £2.20; the snob value
of swanning round Leicester
Square with an Arts Council
Shop paper bag has been set
at 80p.
Ambit is dominated by
poetry—an art form of which I
i n c r e a s i n g l y s u s p e c t we
s c i e n t i s t s k n o w l i t t l e .
However, I recognised Henry
Graham's Ozy as a clever
parody of Coleridge and I was
intrigued by the Cento, a form
of poetry composed of lines
s n a t c h e d , m a g p i e - f a s h i o n ,
from the works of others. The
Cento goes back to the times
of Homer, but the Centos by
James McLaughlin are fun to
read and have a variety of
sources.
Apart from poetry there are
drawings, i n c l u d i n g four
H o c k n e y s and the R C A
p r i n t m a k e r s ' e x h i b i t i o n
(Barbican) in colour, and
there is prose—Bax on beds,
Ballard q u i z z e d , but big
Blondes by Geoff Nicholson is
one of the funniest, oddest
short stories I have ever
encountered.
Ambit gives a glimpse of
another world—literary and
artistic, mature, self-secure.
Certainly it is the world of
another generation from ours
(and it is very different from
The Phoenix, rising next
week). If you have literary
pretensions, if you like poetry,
if you wish you knew more
about poetry, then Ambit is
worth a read. But get it in
Highgate—I can always lend
you my paper bag!
