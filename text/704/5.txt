Mud, mud,
glorious mud
NEWS!]
IT CAME CLOSE to raining and
it was bitterly cold which is
probably why only three hundred
people turned out for last
Saturday's Rag Fete.
Despite the bad weather nearly
£700 was raised during the
afternoon. The only mishap was
before Lady Flowers opened the
Fete when a hundred people
sneaked into the Queens Tower
which was accidently left
unlocked. In the spirit of Rag,
next year's Rag-chairman John
Ingham decided to charge 50p to
let people out. When someone
refused to pay John very
generously invited them to jump
off the Tower at no charge. The
highlight of the Fete was a mud-
wrestling contest with Guilds
President, Maribel Anderson
taking on anyone and everyone.
Dressed in a clinging swimsuit
Maribel remained champ until
Guilds President-Elect, Roger
Preece clambered on top of her
and pushed her shoulders below
the mud line. Among others
celebrities who took a bath (some
more willingly than others) was
ICU President, Ian Bull who was
unceremoniously debagged and
left lying face down and bare-
cheeked. By the end of the
afternoon dozens of people were
wondering round the Queens
Lawn, some splattered and other
completely covered with mud.
This gave rise to a new form of
'hit' with mud-clad students
being paid to hug people.
Among the other attractions
was the now traditonal fire-
eating act. Last year's one figure
had multiplied into five dare-
devils who put on a stunnning
display The Royal School of
Mines Union presented their
infamous peep show, Debsoc had
a 'Rent an Argument' stall, food
and drink appeared everywhere
and IC Radio provided non-stop
music. A rather more
unorthodox stall was one called
'Twat the Rat', where a rat was
Duncan Moore-breathing fire
put into the top of a tube and
people had to hit it with a stick
when it slid out of the bottom.
Needless to say this particular
stall did not last long since there
was only one rat.
The finale of the Fete involved
ICU President-elect Carl
Burgess. Following in the
footstope of last year's Guilds
President Mike Stuart, he
volunteered to have his head
shaved by Maribel Anderson and
ended up looking like Mr T.

Another 'true' story.
The Queen's Tower used to be
open all the time. However, when
exam time came students used to
hurl themselves off the top. One
from the Physics department
shouted Shrddinger's wave
equation as he/she jumped.
Another timefive Chinese students
jumped arm-in-arm, assuming
that they had failed their finals
after a particularly hardpaper. In
fact all had passed. Following this
the college authorities decided
enough was enough, and closed it
except for special occasions.
Except that no-one has ever
jumped off the top of the Queen's
Tower.
Any correspondance about
this column should be addressed

particularly interested if anyone
wants to bring a story to my
attention.
