A good, though not the
strongest, Imperial athletics
squad competed in the UL
Championships, on 30 April/1
May with the result that our
mens' team just missed winning
(why didn't the T and F Sec
throw the hammer?!).
On the first day, Jo Savage did
the ladies proud in the High
Jump (third, 1.55m) and gained a
point in the Shot coming sixth.
Chris Weedon beat the
opposition convincingly in the
2000m Walk, and in the 2000m
Steeplechase Bryan Gamblin
and Jon Lea brought in good
points coming second and sixth
respectively. In the most
competitive event of the day,
Roger Loughney missed third
place in the 100m final by a
whisker.
The second day brought the
greater share of Imperial's
points. Jo picked up more points
for the ladies with fifth position in
both the Long Jump and the
200m final. In the mens' 200m,
Roger Laughney and Tim
McCarthy both made it to the
final and gained more useful
points. Meanwhile, out in the
field, Peter Sedderz took third in
the Discuss and fifth in a
competitive Javelin event.
Some very fine Long Jumping
from Denzil Nicholson (6.90m)
backed up by Mark Luscombe
brought us a maximum eleven
points for the event. Mark
further displayed his class as a
quality athlete by winning the
mens' High Jump and soundly
beating the opposition (including
Andy Cain who gained fourth
place) in probably his best
discipline, the 110m Hurdles.
Thanks are due, as well as to
those above, to all those who
supported the team, competed
well, and hopefully enjoyed
themselves.
Ladies' squad: Miranda,
Sabrina ,Irena and Jo.
Rest of Mens' squad: Allan,
Gavin, Roger, James, Dave,
Mark, Andy, Andrew and
Duncan.
CRICKET
Last Wednesday IC Cricket
Club second XI took on the
might of Reading University, who
had previously beaten both
Surrey and Southampton. It was
a grey cold day. Skipper Gareth
Fish started off well when he won
the all important toss and put
Reading into bat. Pete Threw
obliged by bowling one opener
early on. Roger Wilson was hit
out of the attack and Dave
Leyland took over. The war of
attrition continued until just
before lunch, when Hawoon
Mahmood was brought into the
attack. His first good ball
produced a fine catch from the
skipper and his second bowled
out the batsman. Roger Wilson
made amends with a good catch
to remove the opposition skipper
for 57. At lunch the score was
about 160 for 6. Further inroads
were made by Leyland and
Mahmood as Reading men were
all out for 195. IC started well
with Gareth Fish and Cairan
Hassett attacking the bowling
from the word go. Seventy one
was put on in only 14 overs
before a mini collapse. Roger
Wilson and Haroom Mahmood
steadied boat to take tea at 134
for 3. Another collapse left IC in
ruins at 155 for 7 but Leyland
again and the last Batsman, Ian
Morgan, took IC to within 6 runs
of Victory before another
collapse to 191 all out. Ian
Morgan's running included an
enormous 6 which really shook
the opposition.
Result IC 2nd XI lost by 4 runs.
Good performances from Pete
Trew 20 overs 1 wicket for 58
runs, Dave Leyland 19 overs 4
wickets for 60 runs. Haroon
Mahmood 11 overs 5 wickets for
31 runs.
Gareth Fish 36, Cairan Hasset
36, Roger Wilson 38 and Ian
Morgen 31.
