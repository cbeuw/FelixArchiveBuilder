I D E A S
•William Petersen locked himself in a
cupboard for twenty hours, losing a
stone in weight in order to experiencethe
deprivation of solitary confinement, for a
new play, In The Belly Of The Beast.
Directed by Robert Falls, the play is an
extroardinary adaptation of the personal
correspondance between Jack Abbott, a
convicted murderer, and Normal Mailer,
an American novelist. Although the
correspondance secured his parole,
Abbott was jaile six weeks later on a
separate charge. The play runs from 21
May to 1 June at the Lyric Studio,
Hammersmith.
^Correction: D u e t o u n f o r s e e n
circumstances, Jimmy Rogers, who was
due to play at the 100 Club this Sunday,
will not be able to appear. He will be
replaced instead, by Jimmy 'Fast Fingers'
Dawkins, about whom I, and the 100
Club, know absolutely nothing.
