Torment of
harrassed
students
T H E P R O B L E M S O F private
sector accommodation have been
highlighted this week as three
Imperial College students left
their flat in South Kensington
after a campaign of harrassment
by their landlord.
The three female students took
the flat last September. The
previous occupants are alleged to
have been prostitutes, which led
to problems with 'clients' who
were unaware of the change in
use of the premises. There was
unpleasant cleaning for the
students to do, and certain
'equipment' had to be thrown out
when they moved in. The
landlord, who is thought to go
under several names, claimed to
know nothing of the business
alleged to have been carried out
previously at the flat.

building went into default, but
allowed the students to stay until
the summer. Despite the fact that
the ex-landlord now has no claim
to the property, he has continued
to unsuccessfully demand rent
payments from the students.
The campaign of harrassment
reached such proportions that
the students were forced to leave
last week, a n d C o l l e g e
accommodation has been found
for all of them.

The Tragedy of Gambling
Rumour has it that Mad Oirish
Bookie John Passmore started it
when he was President all those
years ago.
Union Administrator 'Auntie'
Jen spread the bug to future
generations. Even Christine
'Horseface' Teller couldn't
distract them from it. We are
talking, of course, about horse-
racing in the Union Office. Once,
the long, boring afternoons
between lunch and coffee (or a
committee) were spent sipping
sherry and engaging in polite
conversation. Now they ring to
cries of encouragement, cheers
for the winners, groans for
disappointment for the more
frequent losers as sabbaticals and
staff crowd in front of the old
black and white T V set in the
Union Office.
At the end of the day the floor
is littered with spend betting
slips, bearing the hurriedly
scribbled inscriptions, 'Jen,
Langouste d'Automne, 5—1',
'Dave, Monster Munch, 15—1',
'Eric, Sainsburys Express, 99—1'
and such.
But soon all this will change.
When the I C U computer, arrives,
Jen will be busy learning to
operate it in order to produce
computerised betting slips. Then
all the Union officers and staff
will be able to concentrate on the
gee-gees.
