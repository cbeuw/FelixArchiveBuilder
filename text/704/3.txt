Petition
A PETITION has been delivered
to the FELIX Office signed by
more than 40 seond-year
computing students, complain-
ing that courses in COBOL and
FORTRAN have been scrapped.
The petition goes on:
The attitude of the academic
staff is that 'our graduates do not
need these languages'. However
industry does still use them. We
the undersigned consider the
department's attitude naive and
ill-considered and ask for the re-
instatement of very short lecture
courses in these languages.
Vandals
A C A R P A R K E D outside
Linstead Hall was vandalised on
Monday night.
The locks of the grey VW
Derby G L S were glued,
obscenities were scratched into
the paintwork, and the petrol
tank was filled with sugar.
Anybody who saw the vandal
at work should contact Geoffrey
Reeves, College Security Office.
All information will be treated in
confidence.

VICTOR MOONEY, who retires at the end of the month, was
presented with a nautical telescope by the Rector at a farewell
reception on Monday.
Mooney arrived at the College 32 years ago when his salary
was just over Â£700. It was agreed that this would rise if he proved
satisfactory.
Mr Mooney's retirement plans include sailing his luxury yacht,
at present docked in Southampton where Mooney has recently
bought a mansion.
Watch out for the 'Goodbye Victor' FELIX special on 31 May.
