PROBLEM
On a tropical island, "white men" and "black
men" were mixed, but the white men were so tanned,
they were indistinguishable from the "blacks". A l l
wished to leave the island. One difference only
existed between them, namely: "whites" always
told the truth; "blacks" never told the truth.
One day an opportunity arose for 1 white man
to be rescued. The rescuer had the following con-
versation with three applicants:
Rescuer to 1st man: "Are you a white man or a
black man?" and the answer was lost in the wind.
Rescuer to 2nd man: "What did the 1st man say?"
2nd man: "He said he was a black man, but I'm a
white man."
Rescuer to 3rd man: "What did the 1st man say?"
3rd man: "He said he was a white man and I m a
white man tooi1
Which one was a white man and how did the res-
cuer know?
