The Natural History Society plan a short expedition
to Little Cumbrae Island off Scotland , next sum-
mer vacation. The object will be to study the flora
and fauna and to make a thorough survey of the island.
The expedition will consist of about 10 members, i n -
cluding a Geologist, Mining Geologist, Surveying En-
gineer, Biologists and Botanists. Several interest-
ed firms will supply the equipment for the expedition,
which has the backing of the Scottish Marine Biolog-
ical Research Station. The expedition has the
hacking of I.C. Union Council.
MAJOR EXPEDITION PROPOSED
In 1938 there was an Imperial College expedition to
JAN MYANLAND in the Arctic which brought to the coll-
ege immense prestige as well as much scientific mat-
erial for subsequent study. The idea has now been
mooted, before I.C. Union Council, that i t i s time
that another such expedition should be planned. Mr.
P.K.Isaac (President, Natural History Society) and
Mr. P.T.Haskell (past President) are responsible for
this idea. Destination, date and scope of the ex-
pedition have not yet been decided.

ARMS & THE MAN
From Nov. 28 to Dec. 2 Shaw's 'Arms and the Man' ran
to packed houses in the Upper Hall of Imperial Coll-
ege Union. The play was a joint production of Lon-
don University Dramatic Society and Imperial College
Dramatic Society, the former supplying the majority
of the c ast and the latter the producer (Christopher
McKoen), the premises and the greater part of the
sweat and t o i l backstage.
The first night, being 'Mines Night' might be
fairly described as 'Uproar'! Actors from other
colleges must have wondered into what lion's den
they had been committed by our offer to house the
L.U.D.S. production. The play had a normal audi-
ence on the other four nights and a critique appears
on another page.
MINES NIGHT
Although i t must have been embarrassing for a
lady to find 200 Miners and gentlemen in her bedro-
om, Raina was soon reassured by the audience's bed-
side manner and the hisses that greeted the appear-
ance of Bluntschli must have finally convinced her
that her virtue was safe i n their hands. Indeed,
the frequent use of bad language shocked the Mines
who also thought that the joke about "a pet What?"
was rather close Shavian. Altogether the first
act was a good example of what a Mines' night should
be.
However the standard f e l l during the second act.
There was some good witticisms, notably when Sergius
appeared looking as i f he had come straight for the
bedroom scene, while theaudience was suitably intr-
igued when Nicola almost exposed what the butler saw.
Unfortunately most of the act resaembled a Peace Con-
ference. When, i n the final scene, the actors beg-
an quarrelling, a cry from the back threatening the
use of -the atom bomb broke off a l l diplomatic rela-
tions and the resBemblance was completed.
As a whole the night must be regarded as a f a i l -
ure. It i s a pity that L.U.D.S., being our guests
for the first time, should have been introduced to
the R.S.M. through a perfoasmance definitely below
the traditional standard. The idea of a Mines' n i -
ght i s to comment on the lines, not drown them, and
in past years the Miners have «nuired a reputation
for knowing when to keep their mouths shut, as well
as when to open them. The reputation must have been
badly damaged on the Tuesday.
If only Shaw were alive now, i t would k i l l him.
HEARD IN A 52 BUS
She: (noticing scaffolding opposite the Albert Hall)
"What's that, 'enry?"
He: "Beh lass, that's a statue to Victoria or sum-
mat like that."
She: (after a contemplative pause) "Aye, I reckon
i t ' l l be nice when i t ' s finished."
Stealth.
Out into the night to steal he stole,
His bag of chink i t chunk,
And many a secret smile he smole
And many a wink he wunk.
