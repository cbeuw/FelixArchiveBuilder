•Two UROP Summer Projects.
Suitable for students of computing but
also others with a strong background
in computing. Both projects will
require the use of assembly code on
the LSI/11.
1. Data Acquisition in Real Time on
an LSI-11 computer, develop test and
document software for streaming
analogue data without loss of samples
from several channels onto digital
magnetic tape at continuous rates up
to the hardware limitations of the
system. Routines for reading the data
back and previewing it graphically are
also required.
2. Network Filing. LSI-11 computers
are to be connected to an existing
ominet network which contains a disk
file server The directory formats of the
Omninet disk are not the same as
standard directories for the LSI-11
system, routines are required for
transferring files from the Omninet disk
from the LSI-11 (more difficult because
the Omninet directory must be updated
safely).
UROP bursaries are available for
these projects at the current UROP rate
of £700 for 10 weeks. Those interested
should apply in writing to Dr D M
Monro, Elec Eng. Please give details of
relevant experience and the name of a
staff member familiar with your
computing work.
