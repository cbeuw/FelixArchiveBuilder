constitute the Exec. Whilst a
number of Council members do
not support the proposals as they
stand at present it is likely that
they will open the issue for wider
debate.
Hair
today
Guilds President Mike Stuart is
to have his head shaved at the
Rag Fete on Saturday if £300 is
raised for Rag funds. The shaving
will be carried out by Maribel
Anderson, Guilds President-
elect. Maribel has also promised
to have her head shaved at next
year's Rag Fete for a similar
amount, this to be carried out by
Mike Stuart.
The Rag Fete will be held on
the Queen's Lawn starting at
2pm. There will be a 6 foot T V
screen since the F A Cup Final is
on the same afternoon. The
Queen's Tower will be open for
climbing and there will be
numerous stalls and games.
Those hoping to see M r
Stuart's head being shaved are
advised to be prompt as it is not
expected to take long.
Eight members of IC Union
attended the lobby of Parliament
on Wednesday afternoon, led by
External Affairs Officer Peter
Burt. The IC contingent spoke to
Peter Brooke, local M P and
Undersecretary at the Depart-
ment of Education, about the
p r o b l e m s caused b y the
Government's recent decision on
student travelling expenses
(reported in F E L I X last week).
They also met a number of other
MPs, most of whom were
sympathetic to their arguments.
Hugh Southey, a member of
the F E L I X staff who was at the |
lobby, met Mick McGahey, Vice-
President of the National Union
of Mineworkers. The ensuing
interview will appear in Felix
next week.

Monday.
Dave the Rave, as he is known
to his friends admitted to the
outrageous behaviour at the NUS
conference in Hull. He was there
on an all-expenses paid trip as
IC's observer, but it wasn't the
conference he was observing!
Sex crazed Dave has yet to file
his expenses claim, but F E L I X
has learnt that it will easily top
the generous advance he was
given before the trip. As yet he
hasn't produced his receipts, but
they should make interesting

And cheeky Dave ends the
report on his hotel high-jinks
with the plea "Can I go again
next year please?".
IC's other observer Hugh
Stiles was more cagey about the

'smoking' and screwing he
refused to comment saying "Give
me a good pork pie anyday".
Rector is to investigate how this
should be achieved. Since the
1983 intake, was up again on
1982 it seems the College will find
it hard to meet these targets.
In addition the College had 114
part time PGs and an additional
1216 people took part in post-
experience or other short courses.
These are primarily designed so
that companies can send staff to
college in order to benefit from
the latest developments in their
field.
New Courses
A new four year course in
Software Engineering leading to
the BEng degree is to be
introduced from this October.
The first two years will be
common with the present
computing course, but the last
two will concentrate on software
design and will include a large
practical content with at least one
term in industry.
The College Engineering
Board is undertaking a review of
four year courses now that they
are becoming well established. A
number of the courses have come
in for some criticism.

Boring but true!
Women students are coming to Imperial in increasing numbers
and now form over 16% of all students at the College. However,
there are still wide differences in their numbers across the
departments. This is one of the many interesting statistics in
the 1982/3 Imperial College Annual Report which was
published at the end of last year.
Particular concern was ex- numbers of overseas students.
pressed that the College had been
unable to find money for general
maintenance of building, other
than repairs necessary for health
and safety reasons (as reported
in F E L I X 662).
The report states that the
College has so far managed to
cope with spending cuts,
although with 'no little incon-
venience to staff and students',
and finished the year 'still on
course', being able to make small
advances in 'selected areas of
development'.
IC and the Cuts
In the present situation with
continued education cuts the
state of the College finances is of
particular interest. The report
notes that the main factor
affecting finance was the loss of
income caused by the drop in the
Since 1979/80, the year before
'full cost' fees were introduced,
the number of overseas students
has dropped by a third. The
College received about £30m
from the U G C in its block grant
and other earmarked grants. Fee
income was £5.4m, with a further
£ 13.5m in grants and contracts to
support research projects of
which 45% came from non-
governmental sources.
The College and Industry
The College founded a new
company, Imperial Software
Technology Limited, in associa-
tion with industry. The company
will enable the College to capita-
lise on its expertise in a
commercial environment, as with
the college's other companies
Imperial Biotechnology and
Imperial Polymer Technology.

To further investigate the
possibilities of the commer-
cialisation of research the College
has carried out a study which will
be published shortly.
The College is also appointing
a second Pro-Rector for External
Development to improve the
College's liason with industry.
Student Statistics
A large part of the report is
devoted to tables of statistics and
some of the more itneresting
points are listed here. The
number of full time students
increased by 4.2% from 1981/2,
an increase of nearly 200 to 4767.
Of these 3250 were UGs and 1517
were PGs, of whom 894 were
research students and 623
advanced course (MSc) students.
Women students increased by
8.8% to 776 and formed 16.3% of
the total number of students.
Overseas students formed 14.4%
of the total, 686 in number, of
whom 446 were PGs. This shows
an increase of 2.8% over 1981/2.
U G admissions were up by 4.3%
to 1160, although applications
were down by 1.5%. The number
of students will have to be
reduced to conform to U G C
targets for 1984/5 and the Pro-
