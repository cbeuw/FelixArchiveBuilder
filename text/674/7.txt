A DREAM OF FLYING
Imperial College Gliding Club
- was the first university gliding
club in Britain and is 54 years old
this year. It is affiliated to the
L a s h a m g l i d i n g c l u b i n
Hampshire, which is one of the
largest gliding centres in Europe.
To go up in a glider has always
been an ambition of mine, so
when Dave Keene, captain of the
gliding club offered me the
opportunity to spend a weekend
with the club I jumped at the
chance.
The usual procedure is for club
members to either make their
own way down to Lasham, or to
get lifts from other club
members. Lasham's facilities are
available all year round, every
day of the week to IC club
members. H o w e v e r , most
people just go down for the
weekend. Any number between
five to fifteen students spend a
weekend at Lasham, it depends
on the time of year.
In the bad old days members
had to make do with the Lasham
c l u b ' s b u n k h o u s e s f o r
accommodation which used to
be so grim that even the rats
moved out. Dave told me that no
matter what the weather or time
of the year the overnight
temperature of the bunkhouses
was always the same—bloody
cold! Since then the club has
purchased an old scout hut
which accommodates 14 people.
It has all the mod cons: a kitchen,
toilet, hot and cold water and,
most important, a parafin heater.
On arriving at the scout hut on
Friday I discovered that the old
. hands had bagged the bunks
closest to the heater. It wouldn't
have been so bad had I bought an
ultra expensive, thermally
insulted sleeping bag like
everyone else had. Foolishly I
bought along a sleeping bag I
found in the FELIX Office. Whilst
it served a useful purpose
accommodating former Editors
overnight in the FELIX Office, it
was definitely not the thing for a
scout hut in the middle of the
exposed Hampshire country-
side. I shivered consoling myself
with the thought that it would be
warmer in the morning—I was
wrong.
I awoke to a bleak February
morning. A n icy cold wind swept
across the snow covered airfield.
I emerged from my sleeping bag
with trepidation about the forth
FELIX
Whilst most people are content just to dream of soaring like a bird
across the skies, members of Imperial College's Gliding Club actually,
do so, every weekend. Pallab Ghosh reports on a day spent with the
club.
The Club's high performance ASW19 waiting to
coming day. After a hearty
breakfast of hot baked beans and
tea at the clubhouse we put our
names into the ballot. The order
in which names are drawn out
decides the order of flights. Next
we had to push out all the gliders
that were going to be used that
day from the airfield's main
hanger. Although it is possible to
hire Lasham's gliders for flights
most enthusiasts group together
and buy their own glider. The
club have three single seat
gliders, a K8 for early solo flying,
a Club Libelle for intermediate
and cross-country flying and a
high performance ASW19 for
cross-country and competitions.
While waiting for your turn for
your flight you are expected to
push other peoples' gliders into
place for t a k e off. T h e
enthusiasts are very much a
community and the emphasis is
on cooperation and working for
each other.
Soon it was my tum to go up. I
was just to be a passenger with
an instructor at the controls
behind me. I was strapped in the
checks were made and we were
ready to go. There are two ways
for a glider to be put up into the
air. It can be towed up like a kite
by a purpose built tow truck or
by a light aeroplane. Aerotows
are more expensive but do take
you higher and you get more time
in the air. Because of the
conditions that day aerotows
were out.
I saw the tow truck in the
distance move off. The tow rope
slithered quickly like a snake
along the ground as the slack was
taken up". The glider jolted
forward and within a few seconds
the ground fell away from under
us. The glider slowly climbed to a
height of about 1,500 feet. You
could see nothing but white sky
and hear only the roar of the
wind.
Suddenly the tow rope was
released and momentarily we
sank, my heart was in my mouth.
Panic and exhilaration filled me. I
was flying on the edge of the
elements away from the frenzy of
life on the ground. It was like
flying in a dream, gliding
effortlessly over the ground, and
feeling totally free.
Once up the glider sinks back
to earth at about 200ft/min. My
pilot was searching for lift to keep
us up. The search and utilisation
of lift is the basis of gliding. A
I Friday, May 18, 19841
be launched
good thermal can send a glider
' up 600ft a minute.
I, like most people who go up in
a glider for the first time, was
ihooked. For students who have
;time and money the next stage is
!to fly solo. Before being allowed
to fly solo a pupil has to undergo
a certain amount of training in a
two seater glider with a qualified
instructor. There is no minimum
number of hours to be flown,
pupils are sent solo when their
instructor is satisfied they are
safe and competent, usually this
takes between 40 and 60 flights.
The club receives a generous
subsidy from the Union which
reduces costs to about £3 per
training flight.
Once solo you have just
begun. The next stage is to pass
another series of tests to be able
to cross country. To be able to
spend several hours gliding in the
air. This is really what gliding is all
about.

taken up for a flight with a vi
