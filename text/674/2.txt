Consoc
Smear
Campaign
Dear Pallab
May I say how sorry I was to
see that members of the
Federation of Conservative
Students at Imperical College
have apparently decided to
launch a smear campaign
directed against the National
Union of Students.
In his letter to F E L I X last
week, Graham Brown alleges
that the report of the two
Imperial College Union visitors
. to the N U S Easter Conference
is, in effect, untrue. These
allegations are not only an
insult to the integrity of those
who attended the Conference
on behalf of I C U , but are
apparently based on no more
than hearsay. To the best of my
knowledge Graham himself did
not attend the conference. It is
therefore hard to see how he can
claim to have firsthand
knowledge of events occuring at
the conference unless he
possesses remarkable powers of
extra-sensory perception.
The whole point of sending
IC Union visitors to the
conference was to establish for
ourselves whether harassment
and intimidation is rife at N U S
Conferences as has been
claimed in the past. I would far
rather place my trust in the
accounts of independent and
trustworthy Union officers who
were actually present at the
event than in the rantings of an
individual who shows clear
p o l i t i c a l m o t i v a t i o n in
attempting to undermine the
credibility of the N U S .
The last thing I would wish to
do is accuse Graham of
fabricating these stories in a
deliberate attempt to mislead
Imperial College students.
However, I would be most
interested to see Graham
produce hard evidence to
substantiate his allegations.
Since libel is a criminal offence
in civil law, I have no doubt that
he will be writing again to
F E L I X so as to make his
position crystal clear on this
matter.
I am happy to be able to
reassure your readers that, far
from helping other colleges in
London to disaffiliate from the
NUS as Graham suggests, I will
continue to point out to them
from an imparital position both

the dangers and benefits of

Democracy?
Dear Pallab
Ever since entering this
university I have been bitterly
disappointed with the Union. I
knew it was 'right wing', I knew
it was run by 'unfeeling
bastards'. What I didn't know
was that it was undemocratic,
that the majority of IC students
had no say in its affairs, and
that it metes out justice
a c c o r d i n g to p e r s o n a l
prejudice.
Instead of calling quorum
herself, as any union leader
conscious of her responsibility
to uphold democracy in this
College, Gaynor just sits and
frowns when quorum is called.
Instead of abandoning the
U G M , because it is not large
enough to be representative,
and organising another next
week and publicising it properly
so that all students will know
about it, the Union hacks just
continue with their reports,
knowing their decisions cannot
be overturned by the students,
and they hold all power.
Take, for example, their
decision to ban a Union
member from a U G M . Of
course the Exec should take
disciplinary action against
students who break Union
rules, but no Union member
should be prevented from
attending a U G M . This
amounts to expulsion from the
Union, and if Gaynor wants to
expel that member, then let her
say so now. It is a grave state of
affairs when the Exec can meet
in private and secretly ban a
Union member from attending a
U G M without having any
appeal or even consulting that
U G M .
So let's have an end to ad hoc
expulsions from the Union, and
an erfd to inquorate U G M s and
let's see if the Exec during their
last term of office will pay as
much attention to democracy as
they do to alcohol.
One final note: 6 hours a year
is not much time. If every Union
member gave this up to attend
U G M s then we would see
democracy done, and there
would be no need to call
quorum. I say this, because the
Exec should be saying it, only
they're probably in some
committee meeting talking to
the College administration.
Please Gaynor talk to the
students as well.
Yours angrily
John Martins
PS: It was me who called
quorum, and if anybody tries to
intimidate me or attack me
again I will inform the police
and consult legal advisers on
the possibility of action
against I C U members or I C U
itself.
Destroyed
Credibility
Dear Pallab
Pallab Ghosh in last week's
F E L I X has probably destroyed
any remaining credibility I
might have had. It appears all
he can do to oppose my views is
a vicious character assassina-
tion.
In The Phoenix I wrote a
serious short story about a man
in prison for rape, who believes
in fascism and is slowly being
destroyed. I fail to see how this
could be described as 'porno-
graphic', a 'little jerk off or
'degrading to women'.
There are attitudes in this
world that we should all seek to
understand; our attitudes to-
wards each other that result in
torture, physically and men-
tally.
We degrade those we dis-
agree with or seek to use, we
attack their mental abilities, we
call them names, we laugh at
them and mock them. The Jews
were laughed and jeered at in
Nazi Germany, Negro slaves
were a centre of amusement in
the 19th century, it seems this
College supports a similar
entertaniing degradation of
women. Women fuck pigs and
dogs in front of cameras so we
can laugh. It's individual free-
dom they will shout! Michael
Newman's a twat anyway! It's
all a good laugh!
When will we realise that
even when those who torture or
degrade are enjoying them-
selves it does not become a mere
laugh? When will we realise that
to assist them is to support
them?
I have called all IC students
pimps, I think we are far worse,
I think we support the
degradation of women and
consequently their oppression,
torture and rape.
Yours sincerely
Michael P Newman

Poison
Tipped Pen
Dear Sir
The impressive rhetoric
delivered by Steve Marshall
drew my attention to your letter
column two weeks ago. I am
whole-heartedly in favour of
such provocative language and
have long since rejected the 'be
nice' attitude of the 'middle of
the road'.
I hope, therefore, that Steve
Marshall will proceed to use his
undoubted talent to provoke
discussion on more important,
relevant and demanding issues.
May I influence his eagerly
awaited subsequent publica-
tions by citing the fact that
approximately 4,000 students at
this College couldn't give a toss
about the social impact of their
selfish pursuit of academic or
financial success. Science and
engineering are meaningless
and dangerous disciplines if
they are not treated foremost as
a service to humanity.
Therefore I suggest he uses
his poison tipped pen in a more
constructive manner to stir
these murky waters of Imperial
College.
