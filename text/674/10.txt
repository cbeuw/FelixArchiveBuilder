IC 2nd X I vs Southampton 2nd X I
IC lost by three wickets
The eventual arrival of the cricket season
usually casts forth illusions of hot summer
days and the gentle thud of bat against ball. A
cold windy day at Harlington falls somewhat
short of this, but nevertheless ten intrepid
men (our eleventh arrived at lunch) grave the
elements to take on Southampton in the
crucial game of our qualifying group.
IC batted first with Gareth Fish playing
some rather cavalier strokes before lobbing a
catch to mid-off. Dave Jones on the other
hand, having been dragged out of Mech Eng
reading room at 9:30am and wearing an
assortment of other people's kit was having
difficulty seeing the ball let alone hitting.
However he and Roger Wilson pushed the
score along to 85 before Dave was eventually
out. At this point the middle order staged a
dramatic collapse, Chirs Cole's impression of
Derek Randall however did provide some
amusement for those who weren't trying to
keep warm inside. In the end we were all out
for 132 which we knew wasn't really many
runs to defend.
At the beginning of the Southampton
innings we took the wickets of their two
opening batsmen in the first two overs and
suddenly we were in with a chance. Howeyer
at this stage one Southampton player decided
to smash the ball to all parts of the ground
and there was little anyone could do to stop
him. Fortunately we got him out before tea
but it seemed unlikely we could win. However
after tea Chris Cole, bowling with the wind,
took a couple more wickets and gave us a
chance again, but in the end Southampton
just crept home leaving us to drown our
sorrows in the bar and look forward to
Saturday's game.
The A G M will be held on Friday 25 May at
7:00pm in the Volleyball Court. Papers are up
for those wishing to stand for posts on the
Badminton Exec. A l l members of the club are
welcome to stand, whatever their ability. I
dare say there might be a little drink in
Southside afterwards.
On Sunday 6 May, three members of the IC
Judo Club went to the LJS in Stockwell for a
grading. Jim Dawson, at his first grading,
threw his first opponent for ijpon, and got a
well deserved yellow belt. Caroline Scott,
recently elected next year's Captain, was
promoted to green belt, not helped by some
dubious referee decisions. Modesty prevents
me saying how well Graham West did, but
suffice it to say I was promoted to brown belt,
after two straight wins.
In addition to Cathy, Ian Nevitt, Sarah
Parker and Chris Dunn were elected onto
next year's exec.
The last scheduled practise is next Tuesday.
Those wishing to continue Judo may do so at
U L U on Friday evenings. A social event has
been provisionally arranged for Thursday 21
June, further details will be available on
Tuesday.
