COUNCIL S L A M S
U N I O N E X E C
The Union Executive was censured by IC Union Council on
Monday for refusing to allow the award of a pot for the
Alternative Prospectus Editor. A motion proposed by Internal
Services Chairman Hugh Southey questioned the right of the
Exec to make such a decision and called for a review of the role of
the Exec.
The motion also authorised the
allocation of a pot for the A P
Editor from the Union stock. The
pot will now be placed in the bar
as soon as it has been engraved.
A new constitution is to be
drawn up to more clearly define
the Exec's decision making
powers in matters other than
those needing urgent action.
Whilst the matter over the
Exec were censured is seen as a
relatively minor one, though
nonetheless important, the
constitutional issues raised by it
may be more far reaching.
Opinion is growing among many
Union officers that a change in
the Exec's structure is needed so
that decision making in the
Union becomes more broadly
based.
Proposals for the radical
reform of the Union constitution
were included in the order papers
for the Council meeting by
External Affairs Officer Peter
Burt. His proposals are for an
expanded Exec o f eleven

which have resulted in the
original opening date of 5 March
being put back by nearly three
months.
The T V monitor will be
installed in the Sherfield security
office where it can be watched 24
hours. It will join the other
monitor which watches the

entrance. The Security Office is
considering extending the T V
surveillance system over the next
few years to cover other parts of
the College. T o this end the
entrance lobbies to Falmouth
and Tizard Halls is to be wired
for T V camera installation whilst
a second set of doors is being
installed. The camera will not be
installed at present but will be in
the future if College find T V

The new launderette in Southside
is now complete. However, the
new facility will not be open for
another two weeks whilst a T V
security system is installed.
College Chief Security Officer
Geoffrey Reeves told F E L I X he
had asked for the system to be
installed because the launderette
will contain coin boxes. Much
damage could be caused to the
machines by anyone breaking
into these. Also, he pointed out
that the room was quite isolated
in the basement and that a T V
system would make it safer late at
night, particularly for women.
It seems that these security
matters have only just been
realised, otherwise the system
could have been installed before
the launderette was completed.
The delay caused by this will
hopefully be the last in a series
