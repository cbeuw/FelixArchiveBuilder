FELIX Anti-Social
Colours 1984
Every May IC Union holds its own
version of Hollywood's Oscar
ceremony, the Awarding of Social
Colours "for services to the
Union". Both events are similar in
that many dubious awards are
made and the most deserving
parties are frequently overlooked
or deliberately ignored. That's
entertainment (sic)! Works of
fiction are particularly successful
on both occasions and it is with
these thoughts in mind that FELIX
this year presents its own Anti-
Social Colours.
The Bo Derek Chest Expander-
David Rowe (FELIX Editor-elect
and NUS observer) for screwing
the Union at Hugh 'Nobby' Stiles
expense.
The Dresser Award for
Costume—Hugh 'Greystoke'
Stiles (RCC Chairman and NUS
observer) for 'sporting' the
'meanest' 'threads' this side of the
Kings Road.
The Year of Living Dangerously
Razor's Edge— Pallab Ghosh
(FELIX Editor) for walking the
editorial tightrope with equal
disregard for grammar and things
in general.
The Terms of Endearment
Space Suit—jointly to Gaynor
'Jack' Lewis and Ian 'Shirl' Bull
with love and kisses.
The Francis Ford Coppola
Award for Self Indulgence—to
Peter Rodgers for this column.
