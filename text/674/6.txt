I N C O S T '84
The theme of INCOST 84 was
the social effects of Information
Technology. Most valuable
contributions were made in the
discussion groups which were
timetabled every day and
frequently overran allocated
t i m e s . T h e r e were also
scheduled a number of lectures
and visits, which gave a certain
amount of background technical
information. The lectures and
visits were intended to provide
an a p p r e c i a t i o n of the
possibilities of the new
technologies, the implications of
which were discussed afterwards
in groups.
T h e t h e m e itself was
subdivided into five different
sections: the implications to the
household; recreation time,
business; education; and the
individual. In order for discussion
to be more effective the
participants were divided into
four groups each day.
The fact that the conference
was given in English, the second
or even third language of most
participants, posed fewer
p r o b l e m s than e x p e c t e d ,
although the ability of some
.lecturers and delegates varied
•considerably. Some heated
arguments arose because of
misinterpretation of a phrase
but, in general, effective
discussion was hampered by a
lack of committee etiquette
making I C U Council seem
d e c i d e d l y p e a c e f u l a n d
d e m o c r a t i c . T h e D u t c h
appeared to have the knack of
throwing a discussion into total
disaray just as it was reaching a
logical conclusion. In fact, it
became obvious that the group
c o u l d never c o m e to a
u n a n i m o u s d e c i s i o n . The
political stance of the delegates
also varied considerably, from
the arch-capitalists to the Dutch
'Greens'.
A f t e r the M e c h a n i c a l
Engineers' Annual Dinner and
Dance, for some reason called
the Cuba night, on the first
evening, followed by a traditional
raw herring breakfast and a
champagne tram tour of
Helsinki, social events were
confined to evening activities.
The IC delegation gave the rest
of the delegates a lesson in how
to get absolutely devastated yet
still turn up for each morning's
lectures. Memorable highlights
. (depths!) were Jo's blissful
ignorance of the contents of the
free drinks given away after the
Chemical Engineers Dinner (and
subsequent regrets!), and Jim's
breath the morning after a
heavily spiced Russian meal
amply washed down with vodka.
The idea of having an Opsoc
chairman helped enormously on
the song evening when the
delegates, and totally bewildered
Finns, were treated to an IC bar
nite version of Of Alouette and
Sloop John B.
On the organisation side the
Finns have an emormous
advantage over other student
unions in that they have the
resources to own and run a very
impressive, modern conference
centre. The campus is the
Olympic village of the 1952
Games and students pay the
equivalent of £12pw for single or
double rooms, better equipped
than any IC block, all of which
' are run by the Union. Through
letting of its facilities the Union
can boast a turnover in excess of
£4m pa. Particularly impressive
was the standard of cleanliness of
campus facilities and the respect
given them by students. Even
after late night parties,
comparable to Carnival, there
was no evidence the next
morning of anything having
taken place.
The degree system is totally
different with student loans being
used for courses lasting up to
seven years part or full time
work. Engineering students have
to undertake industrial work
after basic studies and complete
their degree with a Master's
thesis. Having said that there is
no evidence that the students are
any better than IC graduates but
they do have very pleasant,
spacious departments.
Through informal discussion
and formal presentations by each
delegation, we learnt a lot about
European students' organisa-
tions. In general, apart from
Finland, other countries unions
tend to be m u c h m o r e
bureaucratifc and inefficient. In
spite of our limited resources, we
at IC appear to have a more
efficient organisation, with better
accountability, which is less top
heavy than our European
counterparts.

The Shape of

Next year there are going to be a
lot of changes in F E L I X .
Between now and October I'm
going to look carefully at each
section in the newspaper to see
how it can be extended,
compressed or re-designed. But
F E L I X is meant to be your
newspaper and I am particularly
anxious to find out what you
want it to be.
Cartoons
Unfortunately IC is loosing three
very good cartoonists at the end
of this year. Are there any
budding artists out there who
would like to try their hand? If so
then please drop in to the F E L I X
Office some time.

Advertising
If. on the other hand, you want a
career in the advertising industry
there is a place for you on F E L I X
next year. We need someone to
co-ordinate ad bookings and to
sell F E L I X to advertisers.
of those horrible logos (for which
I must accept responsibility).
Features
I hope to continue having regular
features from clubs and societies.
This doesn't necessarily mean a
lot of work on your part, and is
the best way of publicising your
club's activities. Any newly-
elected club captains who are
interested in a feature can discuss
their plans with me this term.
While on the subject of clubs
and societies I would ask all
publicity officers to start
planning their posters and
handouts for Freshers' Fair.
There is always a rush for
printing to be done in the week
before term starts and so it is best
to get it done this term or during
the summer.
Finally, if anyone is interested
on working on F E L I X next year
in any capacity, then please come
along. No previous experience is
r e q u i r e d , a n d no great
commitment is expected. If you
just have a good idea for F E L I X
next year, then please feel free to
drop in to the F E L I X Office to
discuss it.
Sport
N a m e .
Sport is one of the areas that I
promised to change. With the
help of club captains, I am going
to have a weekly results table to
show how IC teams are doing. As
for the sports articles themselves,
I would like to see them presented
in a more professional way. The
first thing I'll do will be to get rid
