Aa everyone knows, the resources
of the Joint (Recruiting Board) are
at the present time pitted against
those students who have hitherto
evaded the perils of National Service.
In order to lessen the odds we present
this exclusive guide to the methods of
beating the army without actually re-
sorting to warfare. This summary has
been prepared from the documents of
the Government itself.
There is one, and only one, way
in which a man can completely free
himself of National Service obligations
and that i s to fail the medical. Unfor-
tunately i t is not normally possible
to apply for a medioal without mnking
oneself liable for immediate oall up
i f found medically f i t , and so this is
a gamble for very high stakes indeed.
However, in cases where failure seems
certain a medical can be arranged with-
out obligation (that is, even i f you
have already obtained deferment) pro-
vided you can get your doctor to sup-
port your claim. This i s well worth
doing and i f you think there is any
chance of i t happening to you go and
have a chat with your doctor - there's
nothing to lose and a l l to gain. Re-
member you don't have to be a cripple -
just Grade 3.
Almost as good i s indefinite
deferment. The snag here is that the
graduate must remain in a position
for which indefinite deferment i s
granted until he reaches the ripe old
age of 26. Comparative safety i s
afforded by oertain Government posts
in the Ministry of Supply, Admiralty,
Atomic Energy Authority Establishments
and the Colonial Office, also work on
high-priority defence projects i n i n -
dustry. However, in these oases men
without National Service obligations
are usually recruited in preference
to those who have. Those with a
"First", or with a "Second" and a
higher degree (M.Sc., Ph.D., etc.)
are indefinitely deferred i f they
take up a position in the United
Kingdom for which their qualfioations
are required. However, P.G. study or
research may be done abroad i f desired.
School-teaching is open to science
graduates and carries indefinite
deferment but, i n the case of Physics
and Mathematics only, a first or second
class Honours degree is required.
There is no deferment for University
or Technical College lectures. Agri-
culture and coalmining offer the only
other opportunities.
Having exhausted a l l known ways
of avoidance we come to deferment in
its l i t e r a l sense. It i s important
to note that you cannot stay at College
until you are 26. Regulations clearly
state that deferment will not be grant-
ed for courses which end after the
applicant's 26th birthday. Deferment
ia granted for Graduate Apprenticeships
in Industry and for post graduate study
or research at University. Those with
pure science degrees who do Graduate
apprenticeships must study part-time
for the relevant professional quali-
fications (usually one day a week i s
granted far this).
Those who are thinking of fleeing
the country should note that deferment
can only be granted for government
posts and certain post graduate courses
abroad. Those who leave without telling
anyone are liable for National Servioe
in this country until they are old men
of 36 and probably liable where they
settle also.
We regret that we are unable to
accept responsibility for the Ministry
of Labour and National Servioe. But
i f you're wondering whether it's worth
a l l the trouble - oould you live on
L/6d. a day?
SMITH OF THE ANTARCTIC
Martin Smith (ex-Chem. Dept.)
sailed last October for the Antarctic 7
in the "John Bisooe." After a very
interesting voyage, calling at the
Falkland Islands and South Georgia,
he arrived in January at the base in
Grahamland where he will spend the
next two years. He is working for
the Falkland Island Dependencies
Survey as a meteorologist, but much
of his spare time is spent making a
film about Antarctica.
Martin would be glad to receive
letters from any of his friends at
I.C. (especially Photo. Soc. and
Mountaineering Club members). His
address i s :
Argentine Islands,
Grahamland,
via Port Stanley,
Falkland Islands,
South Atlantic.
Lettera should be posted before the
end of September, i f they are to
reach him on the next supply ship.

"All the world's a stage and a l l
the men and women merely players."
FELIX is the stage on which the news
and views of I.C. are recorded and
discussed. The Editor is our stage
manager, and over the past year Peter
Levin has carried out this task with
great acumen. It might however be
appropriate to question Shakespeare's
words, for even though FELIX is pro-
duced by a happy team of workers, far
more of each issue has been written
and produced by Peter himself than
is generally realised.
Editors too frequently have their
exits and their entrances but Peter has
held the stage for the record time of
one year.Each Editor adds that little
bit of something that makes FELIX a
living organism. Having a facile wit
is one requirement; a sense of res-
ponsibility is needed to balance this
and in addition i t is very essential
to remain in a state of amity with the
rest of the Board. Peter discovered
this and repented after he had, in a
light-hearted moment, sacked half the
members of his staff.
One of his amusements, between
FELICES, is said to be Electron Dif-
fraction - pursued in the Chemical
Engineering Department,and fortun-
ately his enthusiasm for research is
somewhat less erratic than his sleep-
ing hours.
Far be i t from us to enquire the rea-
son but his hostel room ia frequently
a blaze of light at four in the morn-
ing and Lily, his bedder, has many t i -
mes had her routine upaet by not being
able to tidy his room until midday.
We would like to think that Peter was
earnestly engaged upon his studies but
the many occasions he has been aeen
immaculately dressed in the evenings
force us to draw other conclusions.
A staunch critic of Union cater-
ing, he is becoming a proficient cook-
sausage soup being his speciality.
Originally a Physicist, his inventive
powers have extended to an inductive
earth for his radio, and visitors to
Room 18 are likely to hang themselves
on the twisted coils of wire trailing
from the ceiling.
Not the least of his virtues and
vices is a propensity for completely
disarming remarks, most of the better
ones being unfit for publication but
losing none of their poignancy for
being dropped quite irrelevantly into
a conversation.
Of his sporting prowess little la
known, but a recent vicious attack on
the aquash courts may testify to the
intenaity with which he tackles any new
problem. The latest of theae is Jo-
sephine (his scooter) with whose help
he has been able to do much more per-
sonal reporting for FELIX beyond the
bounds of the College. Within i t he
has penetrated to the farthest corners.
The Rector cannot let slip a hint
without >ELIX being there to pick i t
up. Should an ICWArian drop a clanger
- FELIX la outside the door. The ear
of FELIX is in Council, the eye of FE-
LIX in the Planning Office, - and in
all of these guises can the Editor be
found.
But although you may not have no-
ticed him listening, when hla obaerva-
tlons were stated in his Editorials
you have read, you have commented, and
some of you have even thought'.
In conclusion the Editor wiahea
me to state that now the mantle of
FELIX has fallen from him and there
are one or two things he s t i l l wish-
es to do, He has every intention of
living to 120.
