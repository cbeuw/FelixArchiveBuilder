lies; they were duly signed by the
President. There were no matters
arising. Correspondence. There was
one correspondent - he was ordered to
pay costs. A letter had been received
from Her Majesty's Government request-
ing that members of the union did not
use the Tower of the Imperial Institute
for mountaineering practice, however,
they were at liberty to sheet pigeons.
The President reported that a
party of R.C.S. man had raided Kings
College and squired an unclothed
female tailors dummy. This was to be
christened Mary. A questioner from
the platform asked why Mary was not on
view, to whioh the President replied
that "unclothed ladies were not allowed
on the Piooadily Railway; only on the
District Railway, because the presence
of a node could cause sparks to fly".
At this point oaeers were called

UNIVERSITY SOCCER
CAPTAIN AT I.C.
It has become a habit recently
for U.C. or L.S.E. to provide the
University Soccer Captain, but next
season the honour goes to an I.C.
man, B.R. James of Chem. Eng. Apart
from bringing the distinction of
University Soccer's top office to
I.C. for the first time i n 10 years
James has had the unique honour of
being elected at the end of only his
first year.
Before coming up last October,
James was Captain of the Welsh Inter-
national Youth XI and there gained
several oaps. Throughout this
session he has played regularly for
the University XI at wing half and
centre half and was awarded a Pull
Purple i n March.
The College should be well re-
presented at University level next
season for, apart from James, i t
seems likely that Geoff. Moss, who
has played i n the last two matches
for U.L. this season, will be the
Purples 'keeper. I.C. teams w i l l
make news as well, far they have
six XI's i n the League, outstripping
U.C., L.S.E. and King's (4 each).
As new entrants, I.C. V and VI
will go in the bottom new Division
where they will vie with such as L.S.E.
17, West Ham I and Northern Polytechnic
I - the outcome will be interesting.

slips. The President replied that he
could held a jumble sale i n Exhibtion
Read on the following Tuesday. The
proceeds could be used for the R.O.S.
Unmarried Mothers Comfort Fund.
From the floor came the proposal
that the President should wear a pair
of Bloomers at a l l Union meetings.
After a l i t t l e discussion the motion
was carried by 159 - 1 (the President).
i t was proposed that R.C.S.
should not be allowed to vote in the
Presidential elections. There seemed
to be a general feeling in favour of
this, until Miss Ivy Tightbottom said
that "If the motion is passed, the
Mathematicians will have to wash their
own shirts." With suoh an ultimatum,
the Mathematicians capitulated and the
motion was lost by 74 - 6
2 with 24
abstentions.
A need for a masoot in R.C.S. was
discussed. > There were many suggestions,
most being iimjractioal. However, one
whioh brought popular support was that
of a monkey. The President said that,
as we had an Hon. Sec, a monkey was
not necessary.
At this point a number of minor
souffles began to break out as R.C.S.
began a battle with station staff.
As the fight grew more general the
President deolared the meeting closed
and left on a train for Hammersmith.

In a recent match with Goldsmiths
I.C. won both tha swimming and polo
convincingly. Although the swimming
team were without Beckett, Piggott,
and Hills, we won every race, with
Harford and Loveman again showing
excellent form. Our superiority was
equally evident i n the pole, in whioh
we managed to score 4 goals, without
reply, i n a match which lasted only
5 minutes, compared with a normal
gams which lasts at least 20 minutes.
Results:
84 yds.Freestyle. 1.Harford.
5.Cowen.

Itself at the University Champs,
last Saturday.
I.C.W.S.C. is perhaps the most
versatile sports club i n the College,
Having pursued hockey balls, squash
balls, table tennis balls, netballa
and badminton feathers during the
winter terms, the club is now
pursuing tennis balls,cricket balls,
and a somewhat checkered course in
athletics.
In the competition for the Sherwood
Faster Cup I,C. came 3rd. being beaten
by the School of Slavonic and East
European studies and by Wye College.
In the straight Championships, ICWSC
cams 5th. out of 12 teams. This is
no mean feat, when one remembers that
ICWSC is one of the smallest women's
•ports clubs in the University, and
that none of i t s members profess to
be highly skilled athletes.
Our achievements are largely due to
Maureen Baser, who finished 2nd. in
the 440 yds. and 880 yds. and was a
finalist i n the Discus.
No doubt several people have been
intrigued by the small typewritten
notices announcing a crioket match,
whioh have appeared in the Union.
This great cricket match is to be
played between ICWSC and the Crioket
Club next Thursday evening at Har-
lingten, and supporters are Invited
to attend. Naturally the men have
agreed to a slight handicap to ensure
that the match will be evenly fought.
It should also be mentioned that
the percentage of women who attended
Sports Day was far greater than the
percentage of men present.

expeeted by so many of so few".

They wen their second race by sup-
erior watermanship . After about
half a minute from the start both
crews struck bad water and no.6 in
the Herseferry erew caught a orab
