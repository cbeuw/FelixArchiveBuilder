For the first time I.C. ass
shown interest in the W.U.S. Carnival.
The publicity paradei i n Piccadilly
and the pyjama party were reported i n
our last issue and was the only pre-
Carnival publicity from the University,
(Sennet of course said there was none).
Bo, Jess, Clem and the I.C. Jazz
Band participated in the procession
immediately preceding the Carnival,
but were dwarfed by elaborately desig-
ned floats from other eolleges. I.C.
provided a number of side shows,
one of the most popular being the
"Chad-ducking tank". Some enterpris-
ing Minors went around measuring the
height of ladies' hemlines from the
ground; that Bedford Beau, Officiat-
ing at this show was later auctioned
for sixpence by the Bedford President.

test, I.G. oame second to Q

- at
one time no fewer than five jass bends
were playing simultaneously, not to
mention the Test Tndtan Steel Band.
The verdict? A l i t t l e chaotic
without a doubt. I.C. took an active
part i n this show and have sufficient
enthusiasm to do wanders next year.
It would be heartening for I.C. to
regard, the T.TLS, Carnival i n the
same light as C. & G. regard tha
Lord Mayor's Show.
C O L O N E L LOWRY
On June 6th the Union i s giving
a dinner in honou of Colonel Lowry,
who recently gave up his post as Clerk
to the Governors. Colonel Lowry has
always had very olose connections with
the Union and ia known to generations
of students. Before the war he was
Warden of the Hostel, and after the
war he was Warden of Selkirk Hall for
a time.
Colonel Lowry joined the admini-
strative staff in 1923, and became
Clerk to the Governors i n 1934* In
1953 he was awarded the O.B.E. for
his services to the College, whioh
include tipping Derby winners. Always
on the scene at Morphy Day and Sports
Day, he recently distinguished himself
at the latter occasion by winning the
staff race. He i s 64.
While there have been but two
Clerks to the Governors, Colonel Lowry
is the only one known to have climbed
a lamp post in Prince Consort Ed., an-
other of his past-times at which eye-
witnesses report considerable aptitude.
The College will not lose him complete-
ly as he is doing some research into
the records, and It is hoped that a
book may be forthcoming as a result.

The Annual Country House Ball was
held on Friday 16th May at Silwood
Park. A l l tickets having been sold,
two coaches left the Union at 9.0 f o l -

began the danoing. The band, known ss
the Skylinera net of the usual high stan-

Some first-year Zoologists have
recently encountered a restrictive
practice on the part of one of their
lecturers, Mrs. L.E. Brown. On May
13th some of them were apparently
insufficiently punctual in returning
to the lab. far a practical class,
and they were asked to sign a sheet
of paper and state their times of
arrival. The majority having given
this as 2 o'clock, Mrs. Brown then
inserted the correct times, which she
had carefully noted, and made them
sign to these.
The remedy for this situation i s
obvious. Mrs. Brown should be made
to write r-vt two thousand times:
"I.C. i s a University, not a sohool."

About 100 people attended the
meeting on May 8th arranged by the
I.C. "Nuclear Disarmament Committee.*
Professor J.D. Bernal dealt with the
hazards of nuclear weapons and the
bickerings between the U.S.S.R. and
the U.S.A.; Mr. Tanaka spoke on the
views of Japanese students; and Ron
Ledger M.P. discussed the moral
issues.
Some lively discussion followed,
Mr. Goodenough distinguishing himself
by an exhibition of bad manners.
dancers overflowing into the library
and rooms off the hall. The dancers
were able to rest in the seats round
the balcony above the hall and observe
below, the more energetic guests. The
afternoon had been very blustery but
by 12.0 as the guests walked across
to the refectory, the Â»ity was clear.
The refreshments were plentiful but
might have been more delicate.
The bar stayed open until 3.0
aided by a smart white ooated waiter
who skilfully collected a l l empty
glasses. Mr. Andy Matthews also
lent an a i r of refinement in his
smooth announcement of the danoes,
overcoming a faulty microphone.
During t i e evening Mr. Butters pro-
posed a vote of thanks to Mr. E.
Warwioker Chairman of Entertainments
for the arrangements of the evening,
whioh were fully appreciated. About
if 0 i t was light enough to appreciate
the beauty of the scenery round Silwood
Pork, even though i t was slightly
marred by a 'parked' oar i n a field
far from the drive. Danoing continued
to records until the ooaches left at
6.0. As the coaches passed by Vir-
ginia Water, the passengers were
treated to the sight of the early
morning sun shining on the waters,
a befitting end to a wonderful
evening.
The success of the ball confirms
that I.C. can produce dances worthy of
a dignified Country House, and not only
hops reminiscent of a cattle market.
