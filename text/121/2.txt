On April 1st, 1927, Mr. L.E. Smith -
"Ted" - took up his duties as I.C. bar-
man, i n succession to Rosy, the barmaid*
He had previously been a butler valet
and, finding his work completely new
and strange, he thought he wouldn t last
a week. Now, thirty-one years later,
he i s due to retire after long and hon-
ourable servioe.
The price-list on Ted's first day
makes thirsty reading:-
Beer . . . . . . 6d. per pint
Whisky . . . . . 8d. a tot
Brandy 10d
Sherry . . . . . 8d
Champagne . . . 13/Od. to 18/Od.
a bottle
and Best Jamaican cigars a bobI
Things are rather different now
but Ted finds that I.C.'s prodigious
thirst i s unaffected by the rising oost
of living.
Being barman has been far mare
to Ted than just a job. It has been
a vocation, a hobby of great interest.
He has kept i n touch with many old
students and looks after the visitors'
books and records of the various old
students' reunion dubs with pride
and pleasure. He has an uncanny
memory far old students' faces. Fre-
quently he has recognized them after
more than twenty years absence and un-
erringly produces the right pot. He
oonsiders the proudest moment of his
l i f e to have been whan elected an
Honorary Life member of Imperial
College Union, last year.
Ted has served many famous people
in the I.C. Bar. General Smuts was
once adorned with the Bull Club ohain
(yet to be allotted a place in the
new bar) and had to buy drinks a l l
round. The Springbok's Rugger Team of
1952, Lawrence of Arabia, the Earl ef
Athlone, H.G.Wells, Sir William Penney
(who used to may outside "right for
I.C.), Lord Claud Hamilton (equerry
to Queen Mary), Lord Dawson of Fenn
and Tiger Tensing have a l l patronised
the I.C. Bar. So too have Stanley
Holloway, Arthur Askey and the Western
Brothers, who appeared i n pre-war
Guilds Carnival cabarets!
Ted also remembers the days when
the local polios were frequent friendly
visitors to the bar, for darts matoaes
and other occasions. November 5th,
1949, ended a l l that - you can s t i l l
see the soars of I.C.'s fire i a front
of Albert - but Ted remembers when a
fierce Irish meeting was taking place
in the Albert Hall and the whole of
the Hall and Prince Consort Road were
barred by mounted police. No-One
was allowed through except Ted, who
was given a special mounted polios
escort by a, sergeant who recognised
him, having enjoyed many good even-
in- in the oollege bar.
Ted recalls, rather wistfully
i t would seam, the pre-war days when
the whole of I.C. consisted of about
800 students. Residents assembled
in the front hall te dine together
at 7 p.m. every night, led in by the
warden. Lateooaars had to eat at a
side-table and no-one was allowed in
refectories without a collar, tie and
jacket.
During the war Ted could not
enter his own bar without a military
permit, renewed monthly, as the hostel
and Union were taken over by the mili-
tary for eighteen months. Ted is
proud to relate that many of his
customers formed an I.C. company of
the Home Guard and on May 13th, 1944,
were in the King's Guard at Buckingham
Palace.
Until Easter, 1954, Ted operated
in the original bar situated where the
cloakroom now resides. Although re-
calling the old bar with affection,
Ted finds the same homely atmosphere
ia the new one whioh he describes as
splendid in every way. He and Charles
Bristow were the last to leave the old
bar on the famous Last Night, whioh
only a few current students can now
remember.
If most of this article seems to
be oonoerned with life and events at
I.C. more than about Ted, i t i s because
Ted has always been so much a part of
I.C. l i f e and I.C. l i f e has always
meant so much to Ted. He loves talking
about I.C. and reminiscing on his
experiences here but ia much more re-
ticent about himself. However, we
did discover that he served for six
years in the army, 1914-20, and in
1921 received a letter from the War
office asking him why he had never
joined up! Ted has been an ardent
supporter of Chelsea for f i f t y years,
rarely missing a home game.
Ted and Mrs. Smith plan, even-
tually, to move from their present
home near Victoria to somewhere on
the oeast. They will take with them
the very best wishes of many Imperial
College students, past and present,
far a long, happy and well-earned
retirement.
I.C. will not be the same place
without you, Ted. An revoir, good
luck and many thanks far your immea-
surably large services to Imperial
College Union over many years.

The Chinese Sooiety made their
first mark on College l i f e on Nay 2nd
when they provided some very good
entertainment i a the fern of a Chinese
Evening. A lot of hard work was put
into this venture by a Club which has
been i n existence only a few months.
Starting with the inevitable
films the evening continued with a
talk en Chinese Art by a prominent
Chinese painter. Watched by aa aud-
ience of 200, his wife then gave a
skilful demonstration.
In the interval I.C. was intro-
duced te Chinese cooking - Mr. Meoney
please note and provide chop sticks.
After the feed had disappeared, washed
down by China tea, there fallowed enter-
tainment from the stage, Miss Leung
excelling as a dancer and pianist,
and a redoubtable oonjurer product*
some exceedingly fiendish tricks.
NEW FURNITURE FOR SNACK BAR
At the Council meeting on amy 15th,
Br. Weale presented the financial
statement, which showed a balanoe in
hand of £389. The President, who had
devoted much thought to this matter,
pointed out that the furniture in the
Snack Bar was in dire need of replace-
ment. The College had estimated the
oost ef doing this at £400, but seemed
to be hesitating at the prospect ef
spending this sum (although the new
blue Formica counter top had cost
about £250), Accordingly he proposed
that the Union should contribute £200
towards new furniture, which would be
simila r to that installed at Harllag-
ton this year. The proposal was ear-
ned.
The Bookstall Committee will
Shortly submit to the Rector i t s re-
commendations for the future bookstall
en the island site. These inolude a
fitting room, a large notice-board
for the advertisement of second-hand
books, and a barber's shop stocking
toilet requisites. Tobacco and cig-
arettes would be carried, but not
confectionery, and no more sporting
goods than at present.
It was announced that the grand
piano now in the Guilds Council Boca
will be transferred to 178, Queen's
Gate when its present home is demo-
lished. Accordingly i t will not be
necessary to hold lunch-time reeitals
and Antony Hopkins' lectures i n the
Concert Hall, as was feared at one
time.
There will be a meeting ef the
I.C. union on June 10th.
A N G S T A N G E R
The recent Touchstone weekend
led by Mr. Ormerod Greenwood took as
its title "Angst and Ancer." The
discussions revolved around two books
"The Unquiet Grave" by Pallnurus
(Cyril Connolly) and "Look Back in
Aneer" by John Osborne. In his in-
troduction Mr. Greenwood showed us
something of the baokecround of the
two writers, how the former had had
been to Eton whereas Osborne had
been at a state sohool and was large-
ly self-educated. Connolly, born in
1903, shared similar views to W.H.
Auden and had a mature outlook on
l i f e ; Osborne, on the other hand,
tended to be rather of the angry
younm man complex. These oppos-
ing upbringings and outlooks showed
themselves ia their writings.
In the discussion that followed
five pairs of contrasting ideas from
the two books were considered. Each
pair oonoerned an essentially simi-
lar subject, and Mr. Greenwood asked
questions to suit each subject.
Firstly we were asked to define
civilisation and to express our at-
titude to i t . This produced many
interesting arguments, ranging from
the historical spread of civilisa-
tion from one country to another to
the belief that civilisation only
occurred i f the natives of that par-
ticular country believed themselves
to be civilised. Could the ancient
Egyptians really be considered c i v i -
lised since their system of govern-
ment was as undemocratic as possible?
Discussion rambled over many allied
questions; by and large no good
definition was reached. General
discussion on religion also deve-
loped in reply to another question,
but i t was on the subjeot of mar-
riage that opinions ran rife. The
Medical Research Council's views
on pre-marital promiscuity were
quoted time and time again, and
much discussion took place on the
moral and social implication of
such behaviour.
