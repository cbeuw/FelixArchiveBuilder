SHEER POETRY
Sir,
I feel bound to thank Mr. Good-
enough for crystallising the rather
nebulous illusions Of grandeur that
provide many of us with an inexpen-
sive substitute for aloohol, but I
hope he will forgive a few comments
on an idea that i s I admit basically
sound.
Firstly, he i s perhaps a l i t t l e
too intolerant of the barbarism
around him. Surely i t speaks well for
his inferiors that some of them have
at least become conscious of their
social and moral inferiority. Mr.
Goodenough should try to overcome
his natural repugnance and attempt
to improve the people he has no wish
to know in their present state: per-
haps this i s his vocation. There i s
something Promethean i n the splendid
isolation i n which he suffers.
Then there i s the problem of ad-
mission to the Upper - or, of course,
Eight - Union. Our forebears may
have been able to buy civilisation as
Mr. Goodenough would like to do with
his proposed higher subscription -
my own forebears failed while his
presumably succeeded: this generation
is less fortunate. The Upper Union
would soon be f u l l of utter parvenus.
I would suggest an accent test were
i t not for the fact that my own,
Southend-Greenslade, might exclude
me. Probably personal recommendation
is the safest way. Perhaps we may
hope that i n due course Westcliff-
Imperial-Upper union will become
second only to Eton-Balliol-Athaeneun
as a key to the Establishment.
Whether the U.U. (Are you/Too/U?)
would in fact enable us to avoid
being annoyed by the mare brutal
seems doubtful, because i f I know
the more brutal they are likely to
persecute the U.U. (Oh, boy!) even
more than they persecute its pros-
pective members. The beasts!
Tours extremely sincerely,
Fred Wheeler.
NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT-
Dear Sir,
Whilst feeling ran very high with
regard to the 'Ban the Bomb* meeting,
I oonsider i t deplorable that 'educated'
people found i t necessary to tear down
the notices.
An act even mare deplorable was
that of a prominent Union official who
approached members of the Hockey Club
after t heir Annual Dinner last Thursday
and endeavoured to persuade them to
interfere with the meeting.
Whatever one's shade of opinion
may be, i t would seem reprehensible
to apply suoh methods.
Yours sincerely,
B. Marshall.

Dear Sir,
As an attempt to publicise the
meeting on Nuclear Disarmament last
week, posters were put up i n the
Union and around College. In addi-
tion, a personal letter1
was posted
in the College Racks for each
individual member of I.C. Most of
the posters were ripped down and
few of the letters reached the
people to whom they were addressed.
This, presumably , i s the work
of some unknown extremist in the
College, to whom personal liberty
means very l i t t l e . (For this i s
indeed a breach of individual
liberty and free expression.)
However, as a result of this
certain members of the Union exe-
cutive were informed and asked to
investigate the matter. Surprisingly
enough these individuals seemed recon-
ciled to the stats of affairs and
were very reluctant to investigate
further. While members of the Union
executive may not agree with the
aims of the meeting, should suoh a
serious matter as the theft of
letters from racks and the general
supression of individual initiative
(whioh I.C. badly needs) be left to
go unnoticed?
Tours sincerely,
Peter Smith.
Dear Sir,
May I, with your permission, take
this opportunity of expressing my con-
tempt and disgust at the base way i n
which certain political factions are
selfishly exploiting a great many
thinking moralists. I am aware that
I am not alone in these thoughts and
I hope this letter expresses the
feelings of many more people.
In your last issue my name appeared
on a l i s t attached to a letter concern-
ing nuclear disarmament. I was assured
that the so-called nuclear disarmament
committee was purely a non-official
and non-politoal organisation, but
once more the inevitable happens, for
some members of the committee have
attached i t to the Socialist Society,
not, say, the Debating Society. As
a former Chairman of the S.C.C. I
must point out that, as should be the
case, there has been no mention of the
Socialist Society on any notices or
illegal circulars which have been
distributed around the Union.
My reasons for supporting nuclear
disarmament are philosophical and
personal, not political, and I am
prepared to discuss them with anybody
privately. To be consistent with my
views I would sooner die in a nuclear
war than allow any political faction
at a l l to achieve another quits diff-
erent aim by attaching itself to this
MORAL question. To say 'ban the
H-bomb' for myself i s merely to assert
the freedom of the individual to live
as he wishes far the common freedom
of human l i f e . To attach this question
to sny political party or 'cause' i s
to negate that freedom.
I wish, formally, to renounce a l l
connection with the I.C. "Nuclear
Disarmament Committee."
I am, sir, your obedient servant,
A.M. Hodgson.

MINES NIGHT
Dear Sir,
I deplore your unwarranted comment
whioh appeared an the front page of the
last issue of FELIX, stating that i t i s
unlikely that there will be any further
Mines Nights.
Since the organisers of this event,
the Royal School of Mines, have made no
announcement to this effect, you have
no grounds far printing such a sugges-
tion.
Tours faithfully,
P

(President R.S.M.)
Dear Sir,
With reference to the complaint
made by the President of R.S.M. I
would point out that the announcement
was inserted by me and not intended
to be anonymous.
The organisation of this event
does not, i n fact, l i e entirely with
the R.S.M. as i t i s held only at the
invitation of the Dramatic Society.
This is because the Sooiety has to
make special arrangements for a Mines
Night, whioh must not be a licensed
performance.
I can only reaffirmrayprevious
announcement; i t i s unlikely that
there will be further Mines Nights.
Tours faithfully,
L.J. Sweett.

PROF. TAKES MICKEY
OUT OFPARLIAMENT
The A.G.M. of the Huxley Society
took place on Tuesday May 13th.
Professor G.O. Jones, of the Physics
department at Q
.
M
.
C
.
, gave a thought-
provoking address on "Moral Problems
in a Scientific Age."
Professor Jones pointed out that
moral problems are different in a
scientific age and questioned whether
technological advances necessarily bene-
f i t mankind. He cited the Sputnik,
television and the H-bomb as examples
of those which do not.
A problem for the scientist to-day
is when to work on immoral things, and
many students offer crude, almost sub-
human arguments on this point. Science
provides a model of honest thought, but
unfortunately this model i s not always
followed. Professor Jones illustrated
his point with an imaginary Parlia-
mentary exchange on the topic of the
House of Commons bath plug. The tran-
sition from this highly technical issue
to the accusation of "fellow travelling"
was painfully realistic.
In the lively discussion which
followed points raised included the
definition of "moral* and the problem
of how to combat muddled thought.
Officers elected at the.meeting
were:-
President M.J. Amos
Treasurer E.A. Warwioker
Secretary . . . . . A.L. Brookes
Assistant
Secretary . . . D.E.H. Jones
Committee
Member R.D. Finch.
