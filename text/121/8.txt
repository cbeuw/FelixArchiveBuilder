Th.il year's interoollegiate champs,
were said at Motspur Park, on Wad.
14th. liar. The weather waa quite
favourable and the number of spectators
- although ( t i l l mainly itaff - wai
a eonsieerabls lnoraaae on proTioua
years.
As the Broil-country, 3 mllei
and the steeplechase erenta had been
deoided previously, Guild! itarted
the day with lereral point! in hand,
having von a l l those event!.
Although no records were broken
this year, the general standard was
very much higher than before and 30
"standard" points were obtained.
B.Curtis (C*G) pulled off a
double suoeeei in the iprlnti (100 yds.
in 10.2j 220 yds. in 23.0sees) followed
in each time by KM.Ludlam (E.O.S.)
who won the 440 yds. event (51.9 sees.)
A surprise tsetlssl victory was gained
by K.J.Wall in the J-mlle (2 mine.1.9 s.
but the 1 mile was the inevitable
win for J.S.Evans (C&G)(4 mini IS.8 ieot
The 120 yds. hurdles was won by W.E.
Melbourne (C&G) in 16.2 sees.
The eup for the best field
events performer went to J.W.S.
Newman (fl.S.M.) who won the shot
with a put of 38' 5%". The other
field event winners were:-
D. C.Smith C&G L.Jump 20'4jV"
J.Graham C&G H.tfump 5*5"
C.Wronskl B.C.S. Dieeus 116.'
M.T.L.Evans B.C.S. Javln. 150*
W.H.Melbourne C&G Pole.V. 10*3"
M.A.Clarke C&G Hammer 73*

The Athletic Club made a rather poor
start to the term. On 30th, April we
lest heavily to Bristol and U.C. The
team was not at f u l l strength, and the
less said about this match, the better.
The one good performance by an I.C.
man was in the 440 yds, in whioh
F.Goodwin was very narrowly defeated
in a time of 52.7 s.
An I.C. team spent a day and a night
at Exeter for a fixture with St.Luke'a.
The match was not a oomplete walk-ever
for St. Luke's, as might have been
imagined from the BBC West Region
commentary; in fact the I.C. soore
was more than half their opponents'
soore. However, St.Luke's have some
very promising athletes, aad won most
of the events. The most exciting
race of the afternoon was the 440,
won by K.Ludlam in 52.3 s. with
P.Goodwin 3rd. Ludlam, running in
the 2nd. lane, Judged the pace per-
fectly, helping Goodwin on the inside
to come right through, to lose seoond
plaee only by inches. B.Curtis gained
an easy vlotory in the furlong, but
in the middle distance events the St.
Luke's men had the advantage of fam-
i l i a r i t y with theirmpeeullar track,
with a steep slope up to the finish,
which they used with advantage.
J.Collins did well to finish second
in a hot and gruelling 3-miles. In
the field events, Breckon Jumped 5*9",
whils't A.Smith won the pole vault
and M.Evans the Javelin.
Finally, in a very close struggle
with St. Mary's College, at Twickenham,
I.C. were victorious. Our field events
winners were Hewman (shot), Evans
(Javelin)and Goodwin (HSJ and LJ).
On the track. Wall easily won the mile
after leading for the last three laps,
whilst Briggs and Collins took the 2-
mlles and Ludlam again won the 440.
Curtis (C&S) winning the 220 yds.

The heats were held at Motspur Park
on 6th. and 8th. May, and by the day
of the finals, 17th.May, I.C. were
leading from U.C. by 40 pts. to 21.
However, the Individual strength of
the U.C. men - who f i l l ten plaoes
in tha University team - turned the
tables, and we were beaten by 99 pts,
to 95.
The deep team strength of I.C. was
evident in a l l event!; out of 19
event! (asn'i) on the programme, we
provided 2 out of the 6 finalist! in
8 event!, and 1 finalist In 6 otherI.
As usual, we were strongest on the
traek, with 3 winners, J.Sevens (1
mile), J.G.Conway (3000m, steeplechase)
and L.C.Looks (880 yds.). The out-
standing field event performance waa
by D.C.Smith, of I.C., who smashed
the HSJ reoord with a distance of
45'3".
B.Curtis and K.Ludlam (sprints),
D.J.Briggs (3 miles), and W.Melbourne
(120H) justified their selection for
the U.L. team, and C.J.Constable (2nd.
in HSJ), J.W.S.Newman (3rd. in Shot),
and J.H.Collins (4th. In 3 miles) also
performed well.
FAST MILE BY EVANS
In the Athletics match between
London and Cambridge Universities
recently, J.S. Evans of Imperial
College took second place in the
mile, behind Rotter Dunkley. Evans'
time was 4 mins 8.0 sees. This-is
the second bent mile time in Great
Britain this year, Dunkley'a being
the best.
The Staff Rase resulted In a
popular vietory for Colonel Lowry -
the first raee that he has won for
35 years - who was presented with a
bottle of Vermouth for his efforts.
The Tug o'War struggle was
won by the Guilds team who retreated
rapidly from the frightening antics
of 3yd Lenssen to boat the holders
and favourites R.C.S. into second
place. An Administration team,
rounded up by Mr.' Jock' Henry and
supported by Mr. Seaford's two l i t t l e
girls "Science" and "Technology",
challenged and were defeated by a
•eeond team from Guilds.
Four teams ran in the Ladies
Invitation Relay and the first 3
places were:- l.Q.E.C. 2. Reading
S.Bedford. The men's relays were both
won by Guild! consolidating their
lead. The final points were C&G 192
pts. .R.C.S. IMpts.. R.S.M. 71 pts.
Congratulations to C&G on winning the
Governors' Challenge Shield •
The Sports Day Hop was a great
success, thanks to the enthusiastic
support of the men operating the
Bideshows.
Will a l l winners please rinse
and return their trophies by June l s t .
to Room 13, Old Hostel.
C R I C K E T
After a somewhat paralytic display
against L.S.E. the l s t XI has recently
shown some muoh improved farm.
There have been several specula-
tive experiments in team selection.
A notable oase was that ef R. Meikle,
who, although bamboozled and dismissed
by three successive donkey drops in
the trials, was selected for the l s t
team but dropped after neither batting
nor bowling in the first match at
Wye.
Against Eastoote, who were dis-
missed for 192, I.C. seemed to be
heading far a repeat of last year's
magnificent last-minute win when they
reached 91-3. Alas, this was not to
be, as a monumental collapse saw I.C.
back in the bar for 106.
St. Mark's and St. John's were
put out for a tedious 114, and a
sparkling opening stand of 72 between
Bullook (37) and Deal (66 n.o.) soon
put paid to them.
Theae two failed in a high-scoring
game against Old Sinjuns and i t was
left to rather more venerable gentlemen
to bring about a recover. Kapur (66)
and Kitohener (78) added 145 in 100
minutes enabling I.C. to declare at
179-5. Unfortunately the I.C.bowlers
oould get nothing from the wicket and
Old Sinjuns won by seven wickets. A
pleasing feature of I.C.'s play was
the running between wickets, described
by the O.S. oaptain as the best he had
seen for years. Unhappily this quali-
fication could not be applied to our
fielding.
The Sunday XI has won both matches.
Containing a mixture of fine crioiuoters
and compete "spuds" i t has a fine team
spirit and enormous beer capacity. By
the time this report appears Harrhy,
Dytham and bright might conceivably
have made their first run of the season.
It is certain that none of them will
achieve the cricketer's double (10
runs and one wicket during the season)
