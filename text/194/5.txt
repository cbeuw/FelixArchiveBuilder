COLCUTT
The budding enterprise that
prints the newspaper of Imperial
College Union can always be re-
lied upon for a scrambled para-
graph or two. A n above average
example can be seen on page one
of the last issue. It would also
appear that the President and
representatives of R C M Union
have joined the IC Council. The
much talked about University of
South Kensington has moved a
step nearer reality. The Fresher's
Pull Out and Throw Away
Guide to IC is best thrown
away. Colcutt found ten obvious
mistakes. Even the Albert Me-
morial is missing. It is generally
held that scientists have a nar-
row outlook, but few would
guess their world ends at the top
of Exhibition Road.
South of the Border one can-
not help feeling the 'Powers that
be' were a little too zealous in
disguising the milk machine.
Did they feel that Her Royal
Highness would be embarassed
to see a cow in Kensington or
is milk drinking considered a
vice in high places? The very
conspicuous H . G. Wells Society
is more conspicuous than it
thinks. Mr. Good lad and his fol-
lowers seem to have forgotten to
inform the Union of their exist-
ence. Is it that they think it is
all right to ignore the constitut-
ion of IC Union or should the
name be Tizard Hall H . G.
Wells Society?
ONE M A N AND HIS
POWER
Felix congratulates the dom-
estic bursar on his appointment
to the direct responsibility for
the refectories (staff hand book
63/64). This is added to the fol-
lowing positions he already
holds : Domestic bursar-Licensee
of the bars (3)—Sec. of Senior
Common Room Committee—
Warden of Selkirk Hall—Secur-
ity; Cleaning; booking of Col-
lege Rooms—Booking of Con-
ferences; Messenger service—
College Noticeboards—Garden
Committee, beauty—Administr-
ation of College not covering
Registrar—Financial Secretary
and Development Secretary.
Further he is on excellent terms
with Chelsea police-
Anyone who saw the average
engineer at this college might be
excused for doubting the term
GuildsMAN. Anyone who read
the last issue of Felix might be
excused for doubting the intel-
lect of the C & G Union hier-
archy. Inaccuracy, repetition and
beer are its tradition as is seen
in the fairy story. This sort of
propaganda is best taken with a
pinch of salt, remembering that
engineers are trained to work to
the nearest 50%.
The Editor,
Felix.
Dear Sir,
While watching the B B C ' s
new programme "Dig this Rhu-
barb" last Sunday evening, we
were requested to remove our
patronage from the Union build-
ing. This, we were informed,
closes at ten o'clock cm Sundays.
It's high time that this rule was
reviewed—especially as the
Union was far from empty at
the time.
Anyway—for those people
tired of the usual Sunday tele-
vised rubbish—why not tune in
at five past ten on the 20th. It's
good!
Yours Faithfully,
Clarke'n Fletcher
P.S. We are also looking for a
wooden box, to cover a metal
cow which appears to have eaten

WHOSE HALLS ?
On Friday, 29th. September,
new regulations were circulated
to Beit and Selkirk Halls. By
Saturday they were withdrawn,
and on the Monday following a
new sheet appeared. Immediately
rumour and speculation raced
through the College, and the in-
tegrity of many senior officials
came under fire.
Almost as soon as South Side
was inhabited, the College re-
ceived numerous complaints
concerning noise from local
mews residents.
Ostensibly because of these
complaints the seven wardens
met, and compiled a set of „sug-
gestions" to be given to the Hall
Committees when the new acad-
emic year began. Unfortunately
two or three of the wardens be-
came over-enthusiastic and as-
sumed that these "suggestions"
were now law. Hence the rules
of the 29th.
Senior union officials moved
quickly. By Monday the new
rules were issued. Further new
rules will be made by the Hall
Committees.
