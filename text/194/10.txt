RUGBY
FRESHERS IMPRESSIVE
"Old Lags" must train to stay
Many of last year's players
will have to fight for their places
this season. This was the react-
ion of Rugby club selectors fol-
lowing the trials during the first
week of term at which no less
than 65 freshers were on view
and showed an encouragingly
high standard of play.
Wednesday's trials saw the
talent revealed for the first time
in two hard fought games. These
weer followed by a 20 minute
"Old Lags" exhibition. The
most reevaling feature of this
latter match was the sorry state
to which most of the "Lags" had
been reduced by the end.
Not surprisingly, captain Alan
Havard decreed training for the
following day and Thursday
lunchtime saw 45 brave souls as-
sembled in the gym. Old mem-
bers worried about their places
The athlete on tour is faced
with a dilemma : to give of his
best on track or field with re-
ligious dedication, or to enjoy
the spontaneous hospitality of
his hosts to the fulL
For the two are not compat-
ible as was experienced many
times during our German visit
when the morning after the night
before was more often than not,
the morning before the after-
noon's match-
It is in the light of this dilem-
ma that the black and white
statistics of this tour should be
judged. Of four matches contest-
ed, at Frankfurt, Gottingen,
Brunswick, and Heidelberg,
four were lost. However the
margin of defeat in all but one
was small. This was the needle
match of the season between
two of the more proficient
teams in Germany, those of Got-
tingen University and Darmstadt
College. As a result, although
this match produced our best
performances of the tour, we
were in the 400 m in 48.5. Ted
Wilkins who won the 1,500 m
in 4.00.4 and Dave Colvin with
a personal best 800m of 1.55.2.
were there—so were freshers
keen to take their chance.
The final trial on Saturday
was eagerly awaited by players
and selectors alike and despite
the rain, Harlington was filled
with blue and black jerseys. It
was pleasing to note the quality
of performances, especially that
of the first team which showed
experience all round and razor
keeness in places.
Positions will be difficult to
secure this season and it is clear
that constant training is going
to be a vital factor in the life of
every aspiring first and second
team player. This is, however,
an atmosphere from which both
the club and the college will
benefit and should bring the
University knockout cup back to
I.C.
Result: Wednesday 9th 1st
X V v " M " division Met. Police
54-0.
It is ominous to note that these
three have now left I.C.
Socially every fixture was a
great success. At each university
we were left in no doubt that we
were welcome, no efforts were
spared to provide for our com-
fort and entertainment. Tours
were laid on for us, parties ar-
ranged with plenty of Nordic
female talent supplied and facil-
ities provided for training, bas-
ketball, football, and swimming.
In addition Frankfurt, Bruns-
wick and Heidelburg blessed us
with some blazing sunshine in
which to roast our palid selves.
Full U.L. Purples have been
awarded to Bill Wood and Paul
Clifton and a Half Purple to
Ted Wilkins as a result of their
performances on the track for
the university team this season—
Congratulations.
Athletics trials for the Univers-
ity Relay and Field Events
championships will be held on
Wednesday 30th October at
Harlington track. A l l prospect-
ive participants must attend.
Watch the Athletic club notice
board.
BASKETBALL
l.C. AIMS
HIGH
You do not need to be a seven
foot American college graduate
or on playing terms with the
Globetrotters to become a suc-
cessful member of the I.C.
Basketball Club. Indeed, even
without such giants the club
usually has a high standard of
play as our record of holding
the Links Trophy twice in the
last four years will testify.
The club hopes to field two
squad this year—the first play-
ing competitive ball in the
U.L.U. League and Division I
of the London League, and the
second squad playing mainly
friendlies. Games are played on
one or two nights a week with
our home night being Fridays at
our court in Stepney.
If anyone is at all interested
in playing basketball this year
would they please contact the
Captain or Secretary, via the
Union Rack.
SWIMMING
TOUR
This summer the Swimming
Club embarked on an ambitious
tour of Devon and Cornwall.
The polo team managed a 20%
success in five matches and the
swimmers 100% victory in three.
We started off in Exmouth on
the Saturday, where our match
was the climax of the regular
Saturday night gala. Exmouth
won the polo—an exciting
match, considering that little
training had been done—and
I.C. trounced them in the swim-
ming. The polo match we won
at Fowey on Monday was an ex-
perience few will forget; the
water temperature was 45°F and
the time spent in it was forty
minutes.
On Wednesday evening we
went to Penzance pool to take
on the County champions and
were bloodily defeated at polo,
Bob Collins being severely
scratched whilst not unsuccess-
fully defending himself against
assailance.
On Friday we travelled to II-
fracombe for a polo match.
This was the most enjoyable
match of the tour, both teams
played good, clean, fast polo
and the capacity audience read-
ily showed their appreciation of
our performance—a pleasing end
to a memorable tour.
QUOTES OF THE WEEK
Bob Schroter, Guilds President:
It must be nice to be pervert-
ed.
President of the Catholic Society:
No woman has ever excited
me.
CROSS-COUNTRY
NOTES
Pete Crews
Wednesday 2nd October saw
the beginning of the season with
a run for the fresher's round
Hyde Park. The course used was
actually the one for the Hyde
Park Relay. Afterwards the
traditional tea was had in Gar-
den Hall. Apart from eating, the
fresher's suffered a formidable
barrage of propaganda for the
club.
The 1st U.L. Trial was held
on Sat. 5th Oct. at Parliament
Hill Fields. Though the field
was obviously not the complete
U.L. turn out* we did have one
or two promising results. Dave
Reaves" ran well above himself
and come 9th. There was excel-
lent form indeed for the begin-
ning of the season. Chris James
and Pete Crews were further
back at 17th and 20th. It was
good to see several freshers fair-
ly well up in the field; Alan
Walker, Tim Mill ward and
Dave Penfold in particular.
When they have got used to the
longer courses, they ought to
form the basis for a useful club
team. It was also good to see
Jim Bernard and Pete Roy back
in harness, taking it gently, they
went round together and finished
27th and 28th.
A word to those whose names
we have but whom we have not
seen yet. The club will always
welcome anyone who wants to
do a bit of running. So if you
do, have the time and the inclin-
ation see the club notice board
for any particulars. It is at the
foot of the staircase outside the
Union bar.
