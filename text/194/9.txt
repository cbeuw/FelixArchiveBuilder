Once again that thoroughly predictable performance, freshers day,
has passed us by. This year, however, there were a few entertaining
novelties : for instance a bearded exhibition by the caving club
showing how, armed to the teeth and carrying all but a parachute
it is possible to reach Mooney's top eating house without using any
of the facilities provided, and in addition a real glider assembled in
the quad looking for all the world as if it were used to this sort
of thing. These things apart, the search for genuine talent, enthusiasm
or subscriptions was evident on a grand scale. The last of the three
is the only one which will not find its way unerringly to the ap-
propiate stand, it has to be guided and coaxed by notices which you
have to stand on your head to read or can't, read at all ; such is
modern advertising. The Guilds Union, in fact, went so far as to
display their top men seated in a row with above each a photo-
graph of his head which was—perhaps an optical illusion—a little
ART CLASSES1
Have you ever tried nude
painting or sketching? If you
would like to, come to the clas-
ses now being held every Wed-
nesday evening in the Royal Col-
lege of Art, behind the Huxley
Building. This opportunity is
unique; the tuition is by Connie
Fenn, a former R.C.A. Scholar
and all the materials are provid-
ed. It does not matter in the^
least if you have never touched
a brush before; the majority of
students who attend these classes
are beginners, though there are
a sufficient number of experienc-
ed painters to show what can be
done.
In the summer term we hold
an exhibition of the best of the
years work. The major part of
the cost is born by Touchstone,
but there is a charge of half-a-
crown a session. The first class
is at 6.45 p.m. on Wednesday
9th October: ask the R.C.A.
porter for the actual studio.
Unfortunately the Royal Col-
lege of Art is security-conscious,
and I have to hand in a list of
names of people who might be
coming, so if there is any chance
of your coming at all, either put
your name on one of the Art
Class posters or write to, or
ring, Martin Clark, P.G. Elect-
rical Engineering. (Int. Tel.

EX-ALUMNUS
INTIMATE
IN BOWLER HAT
from our correspondent
Excellent publicity ensured a
large audience at the inaugural
meeting of the H . G. Wells Soc-
iety last Monday. Professor Cat-
lin, whose many distinctions in-
cluded personal friendship with
Wells, spoke at some length on
the patron of that society. At the
end of it all your correspondent
felt that although Wells may have
been around in spirit, the focal
point of the meeting was Profes-
sor Catlin himself. Unquestion-
ably a man of great intellect, he
quipped, gossiped and derided,
through forty-five minutes of
fascinating retrospective thought;
the great G. B. S. ("a man in
bad taste"), Bertrand Russell
("who sees himself as grandson
of a great P.M. and spiritual
grandson of Voltaire"), Julian
Huxley, Jack all received ment-
ion. On Wells himself, we heard
mainly of "ses amoureuses"; one
said of him that he was so di-
rect in matters of love that he
did not pause to remove his
bowler hat, another called him
a coarse little man... Ilittle else.
But the society remains the H .
G. Wells soc. and its excellent
programme should prove, worth
attending.
CAUGHT IN PASSING
ISLAMIC SOCIETY:
The aims of the Islamic Soc-
iety are twofold: to fulfil the
needs of the two hundred odd
Muslims studying at EC. and to
enlighten our non-Muslim bret-
heren about our Religion. In
pursuance of the first aim, the
Society holds Jumaa prayers
every Friday at 1.00 p.m. (Due
to the present uncertainty re-
garding the room those interest-
ed are requested to refer to the
Islamic Society notice board on
the Concert Hall floor). With re-
gard to the second aim, the
Society invites prominent author-
ities on Islam to give lectures
and take part in discussions. The
Society invites all members of
I.C. to its functions.
CONSORT II
Imperial College is to have its
own nuclear research reactor at
Silwood Park. The reactor,
known as "Consort II", has
been specially designed for I.C.
by its builders, G.E.C., and the
Nuclear Power Group. Con-
struction starts in August, and
the reactor should start work in
April next year.
The reactor is of the "swim-
ming pool" type in which water
acts as the moderator, reflector
and coolant. There is external
concrete shielding, but it can be
removed for fuel changing with-
out danger. In fact, safety and
simplicity of operation are key-
notes of the design. The fuel it-
self is a uranium-aluminium al-
loy.
"Consort II" will chiefly be
used for nuclear engineering re-
search and teaching, but other
London Colleges will be able to
use it for experiments.

-THEN AS NOW-
"...a huge assemblage of
buildings and schools without
visible centre, guiding purpose
or directive brain... a constituent
of that still vaster, still more
conspicuously acephalic monster,
the University of London...
...The struggle to blend tech-
nical equipment with a carefully
cherished illiteracy, an intact
oafishness about fundamental
things, has been well sustained.
South Kensington will still tell
you proudly "we are not liter-
ary", and exp'.ain almost an-
xiously that the last thing it
wants to impart is a liberal
education...
The Imperial College, I real-
ize in retrospect, was and still is
in fact not a college, but a
sprawl of laboratories and class-
rooms... it has no firm idea of
what it is and what it is suppos-
ed to do... it has no philosophy...
no social idea, no rationalized
goal, to hold it together.
I found myself at South Ken-
sington lost and dismayed at the
multidinous inconsecutiveness of
everything."
