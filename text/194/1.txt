TONY WAS THERE-
On Tuesday 8th October, Her Royal Highness, Princess Margaret
with Lord Snowdon visited the College. The weather was absymal
when Princess Margaret, wearing a wine-red velvet two-piece with
a mink hat, arrived at the main entrance to South Side. After
being welcomed by the Chairman of the Governing Body, Sir Roger
Makins, and the Rector, Sir Patrick Linstead, presentations were
made including Dave Watson, the Union President.
The Royal Party then entered the dining hall which had been
suitably prepared for the occasion—red carpet (coconut matting),
a dais decorated with flowers, a floor freshly polished and a few
students peering through the glass partition which separates the
dining hall from the union lounge. Among those present were many
dignitaries both from within the College and without, other residents
from Princes Gardens and a few students.
