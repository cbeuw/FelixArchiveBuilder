8 m e n w h o s e future is c l e a r
Every year about 8 outstanding graduates
are given the opportunity of joining Turner &
Newall, one of the strongest, most impor-
tant though least publicised* groups in
British industry.
They enter under a broad and thoughtful
training scheme which, recognising the
scope of industry in general and T&N in
particular, gives them time to discover the
direction in which they can best employ and
extend their talents. Every encouragement,
including financial help, is given for them to
acquire the further qualifications they may
need. This flexible training invariably, means
that the graduate assumes managerial res-
ponsibility more confidently—and certainly
earlier—than is often the case in industry
today. The company also recruits scientists
and engineers direct into its research
branches.

YOU may know the name but
Turner & Newall (assets : over
£100,000,000, employees: some
40.000) are frequently described as the
'asbestos giants' but, though asbestos
remains a basic interest, their com-
panies are also concerned in plastics,
insulation, chemicals, mineral wool
and glass fibre. Even as you read this,
you're probably near one of the
270,000 products made by T&N—or
the thousands more to which they
make a notable contribution.

Think and Feel
Yesterday Mr. Alec Robert-
son, F R A M , gave the first of a
series of Tuesday lectures on the
theme 'Music as a Language'.
Mr. Robertson is a distinguished
authority in the field of musical
education with experience dating
back to 1920 when he joined
the Gramophone Co. (now
HMV) to develop the education-
al uses of the gramophone. In
1940 he joined the BBC's Gra-
mophone Department and on
his retirement in 1953 was Pro-
ducer of Specialist Talks (Mus-
ic).
The theme ui his talks will be
that music is something to
think about, not just to 'feel'. He
will illustrate them with music
from all periods except the
electronic one; he has promised
to deal with modern composers,
particularly Britten (whom he
regards as the greatest of all
contemporary composers). Mr.
Robertson intends the talk to be
part educational and part enter-
tainment; in the course of them
he will use full stereophonic re-
producing equipment and a
piano.

CHAIRMAN
DECEIVED
At the end of last term the
Secretary of the Debating Society
sent the Chairman of the S.C.C.
a letter giving the names of
three officers elected for this
Session. It has since been admit-
ted that no elections in fact took
place, and that the S.C.C. Chair-
man was deliberately deceived.
The rumours of a rigged elect-
ion came after the Joint Council
Meeting last term, when serious
dissatisfaction was expressed at
the way the Debating Society
had been run that Session. At
this meeting a motion was pas-
sed asking the S.C.C. Chairman
to look into the affairs of the
Society, and to try and make it
function better this year.
Because of the illegal elect-
ions, the S.C.C. Chairman and
Secretary will be taking the un-
presidented step of personally
supervising the new elections.
The nomination lists will be
taken down on Thursday Octo-
ber 17th. at 6p.m. and the elect-
ions will take place the follow-
ing day. A l l members of I.C.
Union are automatically mem-
bers of the Debating Society,
and are entitled to vote at the
forthcoming Extraordinary Ge-
neral Meeting. The S.C.C. Chair-
man hopes that those Council
Members who were unhappy
with the Debating Society last
year will come to the elections,
and will also actively support its
activities this Session.
