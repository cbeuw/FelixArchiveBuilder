COMMENT
by F. D. Fuchs
It is only by comparison with
other London colleges and uni-
versities that the uniquely immat-
ure, intellectually castrated and
archaic nature Of the attitudes
and customs of Imperial College
stand out clearly. Perhaps this is
why the Executive is always so
determined to preserve our iso-
lation, for instance from N.U.S.
The first issue of Felix this
session, the first introduction
most freshers will have to I.C.
was graced with not one, but
two photos of our president.
Both were of almost identical
poses, identical clothes, back-
ground and facial expression.
This fatuous waste of space
should be compared with Univ-
ersity College's guide to freshers
which contained a feature on the
1963 Campaign on Education
and many references to U.C.'s
participation in affairs outside
the four walls of the college bar.
The cult of the President
evidenced by devoting half Felix
to him is a reflection of the way
he is elected. By removing from
the presumably unfit body of the
union the power of directly elect-
ing their president, they are ex-
cused the bother of thinking
about his actions. Not having
been directly elected he seems to
have no direct connection with
common union members, and be-
comes invested with a kind of
Papal infallibility. The real
danger of this is not so much
that the President may do some-
thing silly or wrong. It is that in
this and many other facets of
college life, students are discour-
aged from forming maturely
sceptical attitudes to the "powers
that be" and from any kind of
original thought.
COUNTER
COMMENT
by the Editor
The issue of 'N.U.S. is one
which most of the College is
glad to see closed. To drag it
back from the depths in which
it rests so soon after it was con-
demned is tedious, and to sug-
gest that the Executive was res-
ponsible for its condemnation is
merely childish.
If Felix is to be compared
with the newspapers of other col-
leges, then we must also take
into account such apparently
trivial matters as facilities, staff,
and support. Felix is recovering
from a move which very nearly
reduced it to a typewritten sheet;
at present it is in the hands of
a rejuvenated staff, and the
future is bright; but destructive
criticism can do nothing but
harm; The essential role of a
staff in reporting beyond the bar
hardly requires explaining. That
half Felix was devoted to the
President apart from being gross
distortion, has no bearing on the
way he is elected. At a Union
debate three years ago, the
motion that the President be
elected by the Union was sound-
ly defeated. The arguments then
have lost none of their power.
It seems fit that Council, who
appreciate the duties and res-
ponsibilities of a President rather
more clearly than the average
student, should elect him. There
is thus little danger of the popul-
ar hero being swept into power,
as happens occasionally in the
constitutent colleges. The Presi-
dent actually suffers the same
human and material temptations
as does the Pope—there is little
evidence for the infallibility of
either. To mention antiauthorit-
arian scepticism and original
thought in the same sentence
implies a warped sense of valu-
es; I comment no further.

. . . BUT WHERE
WERE THE STUDENTS ?
The Chairman in his welcom-
ing speech drew attention to the
interest shown in the College by
the Royal Family. Recently the
Queen Mother, Prince Philip and
now Princess Margaret have
visited the College, also the
Queen is our visitor. He stated
that the South Side building "re-
presents a reinterpretation of the
social pattern embodied in an
Oxford and Cambridge College
or a normal University Hall of
Residence." He then invited
Princess Margaret to declare the
building open.
MEN OF THE FUTURE
Her Royal Highness in her
speech said how the lucky the
College was to have acquired
this site in the West End of
London. She hoped that distin-
guished people who had lived in
Princes Gardens in the past
would be replaced by important
men of the future. Her Royal
Highness then declared the
building open. In reply the
Rector thanked Her Royal
Highness for coming and also
drew attention to the position of
the site.
Princess Margaret then went
on a tour of the building during
which she met amongst others
the Wardens, the Architect, two
students, Hugh Davis and
Howard Moore in their rooms
the University with regular part-
and Mr. Mooney. On leaving the
building Her Royal Highness un-
veiled a plaque commemorating
the occasion.
SLOVENLY STUDENTS
This visit was an important
part of the College Calendar and
it is to be regretted that not
more students were present in
the Common Rooms which Her
Royal Highness visited ; whether
this was due to lack of know-
ledge of where Princess Marga-
ret was to visit, the confusion
caused by the visit, the weather,
or apathy it is difficult to tell.
Those students who turned up
did not have the common dec-
ency to take, their hands out of
their pockets when Her Royal
Higness walked past them—as
was obvious by a photograph in
a well-kown National newspaper.
In retrospect, was this visit
worth the £4,000 spent on it ?
