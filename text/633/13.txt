Roger Moore in the classic James Bond pose. Thursday's Ents film
is 'For Your Eyes Only', the latest 007 feature which was hailed at
the time as a return to the old-style Bond, relying on
straightforward action rather than massive sets. It suceeds well
and is probably the best of Moore's five efforts to date.

For Your Eyes Only the Ents
film.
—Roger Moore's latest film as
007 in which his age is starting
to show. Nevertheless a good

release of two new films; Moore
in 'OctoDussy' and the old
master Sean Connery In 'Never
Say Never Again'.
