GORILLA
IN SHERFIELD
ICU Skint!
The 3-4% increase projected for
IC Union for 1983-4 now seems
unlikely. Instead it is probable
that Union employees' salaries
will be raised by 3'/2% while the
incoms for clubs and societies
will remain the same. Since the
Union will have to rethink the
priorities of various societies, it
seems likely that some will face a
decrease.
Morphy Day
Banned
The tradition of the Morphy Day
tow-path battle is to be discontin-
ued following complaints about
the state of the tow-path after last
term's fight.
In December, the Rector,
Lord Flowers, received a letter
of complaint from David Mellor,
Conservative Member of Parlia-
ment for Putney and Under-
Secretary of State for Energy.
The Rector (who is himself a
member of the standing comm-
ittee on Energy and the Environ-
ment) summoned Union Presi-
dent Stephen G o u l d e r , who
continued on page 3
There were several reports of a
large gorilla wandering about in
the .Sherfield Building late on
Wednesday evening. AH attempts
to trace it have been unsuccessful.
The gorilla, described as
about six feet tall, black and
hairy, was spotted roaming the
lower floors of the Sherfield
Building at about 8:50pm. It
appeared quite harmless, and
even docile, until a hastily-
summoned F E L I X photograph-
er arrived on the scene, where-
u p o n the g o r i l l a fled. The
photographer gave chase but
while he was trying to photo-
graph the gorilla it entered a lift
and travelled towards the top of
the building. The photographer,
hampered by his camera, failed
to catch it, and it vanished into
the maze of corridors in the
Sherfield Building.
Security staff claimed to have
seen nothing, but told F E L I X
that it is well known that a
student in Linstead owns a
gorilla costume, and sightings of
the beast were quite common
until two years ago.
The Sherfield gorilla could not
quite escape our photographer by
dashing into a lift.
