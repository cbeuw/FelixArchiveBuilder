Last Tuesday saw a, not as
strong (or fit) as it could be, first
team score a vital victory in the
winter league held under flood-
lights in North London. Four
enthusiastic IC lads braved
French style driving, slippery
courts, bad lighting and severe
weather conditions to score a 15
points to 6 victory over the ex-
cellent L o n d o n club, Drive.
There were problems of course
both on the court, such as
Christian's volleys and Rob's
forehand, and off it where John
Sear almost turned himself
inside out in the changing rooms
but said he felt 10 pounds lighter
after the experience. The out-
' come was made certain when
Dave Gladman and John Sear
stole their match from the
opposition's second pair, after
being 6-2, 5-4 down, to win 2-6,
7-5, 9-7. The full result was:
C. Langerin and R. Easton won
6-2, 6-4 and 6-3, 6-4
J. Sear and D . Gladman won 2-
6, 7-5, 9-7 and lost 4-6, 6-4, 6-0
Man of the match: D . Gladman.
Worst performance: the opp-
osition and R. Easton. Special
thanks to Judith Taylor. Next
match: Friday 21 January.
Squash
A quick summary of the mid-
season team positions and
promotions,
lsts Div 1 3rd, 27pts
2nds Div 3 2nd, 34pts
(promoted)
3rds Div 3 8th, 16.5pts
4ths Div 4 7th, 19pts
5ths Div 6 2nd, 33pts
(promoted)
Thus the 5 mens teams are
placed in the top 5 divisions for
round 2.
The ladies team is 3rd or 4th
in Ladies Div 2 following some
sound performances, especially
towards the end of last term.
The leader in the individual
cup competition is Ian Grindall
who has yet to be beaten for the
1st or 2nd teams.
As of Wednesday the post
match peanut and cheese and
onion crisp sessions began again.
See next weeks action packed
article for the outcomes. Details
of trips to Germany and jerseys
are on the notice board in the
Sports Centre for a change.
Volleyball
An action packed episode this
week—first an update. The mens
team continued their winning
streak in the S E E T E C H league
with a 3-2 victory over Totten-
ham College, a total erasure of
Hounslow V B C and ditto Inter-
national University Watford (no
joking folks, there is one!).
To crown all this last week-
end, after an arduous 4 hour
minivan trip involving paralysed
glutious maximuses all round,
Liverpool University exited from
the E V A National Students' Cup
by 3 sets to 1. Another arduous
van trip back, more corns on the
ICVBC collective bum (???-Ed)
and a puncture on the M l
rounded off a good day out.

Meanwhile the question of
team shirts has arisen and a
decision is needed as to their
colour and shape (silver lame
sleeveless vs pink frilly front and
Elizabethan collar on sequined
mauve velvet), so there will be a
Club General Meeting on Wed
19 Jan at 13.30 in the Volleyball
Court to discuss this and other
matters. Red tape rules O K .
To finish on an oft-repeated
note, the Ladies team is suffering
from a lack of ladies so acute
that for the last two sessions'
none have shown up. As you can
appreciate, this makes coaching
a trifle on the difficult side, and
leaves me, Pete and Man won-
dering what to do on Tuesday
evening. A t this point in a
Dickens novel the hero usually
gives up and turns to drink, so if
you want us to stay Guniless,
please come along. All welcome
Tuesdays 17.30 to 19.30 at the
Volleyball Court, 2nd floor Old
Chemistry Bldng.

preparing to land. Precise circles and ellipses
make contented geometric flowers; a violently
struggling squiggle metamorphoses into an
acrobatic butterfly; and the night sky is filled
with the spots off a peacock's tail.
Experience not to be missed
'Tron' has a desperately weak story line and
no plot. The film's appeal is totally visual - the
graphics are dazzling. In much the same way
the sound-track of Laserium is almost
incidental, but the colours and images are
dazzling.
LASER is an acronym of Light Amplification
by Stimulated Emmission of Radiation. Given
the right combination of modulators ,
oscillators and scanning controls you too
could produce a gyrating laser image. But, just
as 'Tron' is the (current) ultimate in computer
graphics, the laserium is worth a visit to see
the ultimate artistic exploitation of the
principles of spatial and temporal coherence of
photons!
Where, when, £ ?
There are laser shows 5 days a week at the
London Planetarium - next door to Madame
Tussaud's and the Baker Street tube station -
at 6.00 and 7.30 on Sun, Wed, Thurs, Fri and
Sat, with an extra show at 9.00 on Friday and
Saturday. Tickets cost £1.25 with a student's
card and can be booked up to 14 days in
advance, but no phone bookings.

Family Christmas you're probably fed up to

something light quick and tasty and easy to
digest. Some of you might be lucky enough to
have received a toasted sandwich machine, or
if not, these recipes might persuade you to buy
one at the sales with some left over Christmas
money. In all these recipes remember to
spread a thin layer of butter or margarine on
the olifside of the sandwich to prevent
sticking.
First of all, a variant of the tried and trusted
cheese toastie. Spread both pieces of bread
thickly with cold custard (tinned will do),
keeping it away from the edges to prevent
leaking. Grate two ounces of cheddar cheese,
and mix with a small amount of tomato sauce
and some finely chopped dried dates. Pile the
mixture in the middle of one slice, cover with
the other and toast.
Next, the breakfast toastie. First, cover one
slice of bread with a layer of cold porridge.
Sprinkle on chopped bacon or ham, sliced
fried mushrooms and either boiled or fried
egg. (Boiled eggs will have to be chopped or
sliced, fried eggs can be left whole and
trimmed to fit the bread being used). Spread
the second slice of bread with marmalade,
cover the sandwich and toast.
And finally, a special toastie with that certain
je-ne-sais-quoi that typifies true cordon bleugh
cookery. To a small jar of pickled cockles, add
a finely chopped banana, a tablespoon of
Bovril and a tablespoon of white wine. Stir
thoroughly. Drain, and spoon onto bread
which has been spread with crunchy peanut
butter. Spread covers with peanut butter,
cover and toast.
