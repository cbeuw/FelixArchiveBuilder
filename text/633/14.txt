This week sees the return of Scaramouche
(first years won't remember him), in the most
unusual puzzle I have yet seen. But let him tell
you about it:
Scaramouche speaks: .
Pinocchio's been letting you off rather lightly
recently, so to remind you of the devious .
difficulty of some of my puzzles, here's an
offering based on the children's game of dots
and boxes.
As you're probably aware, two players start
with a grid of dots and alternately draw in lines
joining the dots in pairs. If a player's move
completes the fourth side of a square cell, he
initials it and plays again. Sometimes it is
possible to complete two cells on a move; in
this case the player initials both boxes, but
only gets one extra turn. The winner is the
player to initial most boxes.
Sound simple? Child's play? All right, then,
as a fairly straightforward example of devious
play, look at the position in diagram 1. A has
just won two boxes, and has been forced to
start a chain of five for his opponent. If B is
greedy and takes the whole chain, he will have
to hand back the longer chain of nine to A, and
so will lose 5-11. On the other hand if B takes
three of the cells in the chain, but then seals off
its other end by completing the horizontal line
in the bottom left hand corner, he only gives
two cells to A who is then compelled to open
up the chain of nine to B, resulting in a 12-4 win
for B.
Complete analysis of the game is hard
(pedantically it's NP-hard for those who know
what that means) and there are lots of
fascinating and difficult problems which arise
from the strategy: Diagram 2 is a case in point;
what is the (unique) winning move from this
position?

Last Weeks Solution
Last week's puzzle was rather easy, and there
were 31 entries. Leann Jones of Maths 2 was
the winner, and can collect her prize from the
FELIX Office on Monday. The solution is
shown below. Two entries are worthy of
mention; notably Andrew Lailhamson (I think
that's how you spell it) was the youngest
entrant at only 11, and James Aldridge of
Physics 2, who entered all three of the
competitions, and also won the Superkings-2
puzzle (and can pick up his cheque from the
FELIX Office etc.). The Superkings answer,
10*10, is shown below. The code was won by
Russell Jones of Elec Eng 2, and he can pick up
his cheque etc., the solution to which is this:
Take all the numbers between any two
consecutive commas, square them and add
them, and that will give the position of the
letter in the alphabet,
e.g. 23,12,1114,... goes to;
22
+32
, l2
+22
, l2
+l2
+l2
+42
,.
13, 5, 19,... goes to;
m, e, s,
The answer was:
Message follows in Latin.
Ecce Edwardus ursus nunc
tump occipite gradus pulsante
tophorum Robinum descendens.
...which is of course the first sentence of
Winnie-the-Pooh translated into Latin. Thanks
Perola!
