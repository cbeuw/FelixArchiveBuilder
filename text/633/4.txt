Dear Sir,
I am for the rights of the
individual. This means that I will
try to defend them, as I believe it
is the right and responsibility of
all of us to do so.
We can never isolate ourselves
from the rest of society; our
rights are all interdependent and
linked. It is with extreme short-
sightedness that people say 'Sod
the rest, I don't care about their
rights'. We must remember that
rights are our own creation; they
require general acceptance and
protection by society in order to
exist.
The greatest threat to our
'freedoms' comes from the lack
of respect to the individual as a
result of degrading him/her into
mindless components of an
entity or label. We can so easily
group together individuals under
a simple label, and talk of the
label as i f it could have an
opinion, a character, a personal-
ity. In doing so the members of
the group become a homogeneity;
the fact that they act and think
as individuals is ignored. Yet our
very humanity is about this
beautiful individuality. Each of
our minds is a fantastic library
of experiences, pictures, inform-
a t i o n and h i s t o r y ; we can
understand, argue, believe, love,
and hate. This is our humanity.
Once you forget the individual
then you forget the human
being. You will not be violating
the rights of human beings; you
will not be killing, raping,
torturing, robbing, or sentencing
to death human beings. No, we
merely become labels, we be-
come a creature created by the
mind, part of a nightmare of
mass graves, of tattooed arms,
gas chambers and statistics. So
many people argue about the
'real world' in terms, not of
human beings, but labels.
At Imperial College of Science
and Technology on Tuesday
December 14, a large group of
students took part in an event
organised by a Constituent
Students' U n i o n (the Royal
School of Mines Union). This
took place in the Imperial
College Union building. Mem-
bers of the reputedly learned
institute watched and laughed at
various films of the sexual act
including sex with animals,
sadism, and a man dressed as a
priest. A l s o two strippers
performed lesbian acts on stage.
Afterwards a few students
exposed themselves.
Some people will say it is all
good, harmless fun. To see or
derive pleasure from the degrad-
ation of other people is seen to
be a good laugh. Women are
portrayed as sexual organs to be
used and abused. They are seen
merely as physical entities from
which to gain pleasure. Their
humanity is ignored, human
ethics can be forgotten, moral
laws need not be applied. A
general attitude that in its purest
form will lead to rape and crimes
of sexual violence. A n attitude
that undermines all the rights of
the individual female as she is
not seen as an individual. This
affects all women. Indeed it
affects all individuals. For how
can you expect to be treated as
and respected as a human being
if you do not do so to others?
How can you expect your rights
to be acknowledged and defend-
ed if you do not do so to others?
How can you expect to live in a
just and 'free' society when your
actions lead to injustice and the
erosion or suppression of
'freedoms'?
I am by no means a saint; I
am as much a part of the
problem as those who watched
the film. But we must begin
somewhere; we must try, and try
with hope in our hearts. We
must not be disillusioned with
the enormity or so-called im-
practicality of the task, for in the
end if we do not hope and try if
we distance ourselves and forget
our responsibilities, the future
for us and our families will be
very bleak.
I ask you as individuals to do
your utmost to brighten our
future, to defend ourselves, and
our children. Let our voices and
moral actions be the sword of
justice and righteousness.
Yours sincerely,
Michael Paul Newman

Dear Martin,
C C U activities have always
pandered to the whims of the
more infantile students at
College, but are generally looked
on as fun and fairly harmless.
Yet now, surely, the time has
come to look again—in recent
years the good fun has at times
given way to violence. The most
recent manifestation of this cost
about £1000 in money that could
have been used for other student
activities.
I refer to Morphy Day, when
it is 'traditional' to sling shit at
people from other CCUs and to
attempt to gain possession of the
Morphy Oar. This year Guilds
hired one of the Union transit
vans to use as their getaway
vehicle should they manage to
capture the oar. A l l went well
until the oar was near said van,
at which stage a number of
students climbed on top of the
van (estimates run as high as 30!)
and there was something of a
fracas around the back doors.
The result was one rear door
hinge fractured, another bent, a
rear door dented beyond repair,
and both light clusters smashed.
These repairs and the straighten-
ing of the other back door were
undertaken at an estimated cost
of £300. Certain other repairs
were not done—the straightening
of dents in the roof and the
replacement of the bonnet (both
of w h i c h w o u l d have been
required to return the van to its
previous state) were not worth it.
The p r o b l e m s , however,
didn't stop there. The van was
due to be sold (it was suggested
to Silwood Park) to allow I C U
T r a n s p o r t to buy two new
Transit vans, and it was hoped
to raise £1000 by the sale
(although a more realistic
estimate was £750). The van is
now practically worthless (estim-
ated value of £300). Suggestions
that Guilds might buy the van
for £700 or that it should be sold
have the same effect—a further
net loss of income of between
£450-£700 distributed among the
various students' unions.
Furthermore, a van hired
from Swan National by R S M U
also suffered damage to rear
doors and hinges which, i f
nothing else, cost a great deal of
good w i l l with a c o m p a n y
regularly used by R C C and A C C
clubs for transport.
I do not wish to suggest that
these ' t r a d i t i o n a l ' activities
should be stopped—I feel that
for most participants these
events are great fun and certain-
ly provide a welcome change
from the pressure of work at
Imperial. However I do feel that
the odd £1000 here or there
(which we may never get to hear
about) is too high a price to pay.
Surely it must be possible for the
CCUs to get together and agree
some sort of 'code of conduct'
(or similar) to prevent the
p o s s i b i l i t y of such wanton
destruction in the future.
Yours sincerely,
Nick Pyne
Dear Sir
I, for one, was delighted to
hear of Barney McCabe's pur-
chase of that infamous baby
grand piano from Harrods. But,
alas, I have only ever played it
twice when the thing has been in
full working order. Firstly, the
pedals came off after having
been on for only a month or two.
This made playing somewhat
difficult without any sustain, but
as this was the only piano in
College on which all the keys
functioned, I had no choice but
to perservere. So, I was some-
what dismayed to find, on
attempting to play the piano in
question at the beginning of this
term that almost all the keys
were stuck. I was informed that
the cleaners had been allowed to
clean the piano with water, thus
causing the wood to expand and
the keys to stick. Is this any way
to look after a £2000 piano? It
seems a bit of a waste of Union
money. Yours

Dear Sir
On a number of occasions this
year I have walked into the
Union Bar and found the bar
staff easily outnumbering the
customers. The fact is students
at IC can no longc afford to
drink enough to forget the lack
of women. It seems to me that
this underhand policy of the
College hierarchy to keep
students sober can only lead to
frustration and the unsuspecting
student will be driven to pur-
suing his academic work to
further the name of IC and at the
detriment of social life within the
College. H o w long can this
policy go on? Will the IC student
stay blind to the oppressive
dictator? Join the protest against
academic excellence. Be in the
Union Bar 7 nights a week 6pm
to 11pm. Drink until you puke
and then drink again. If the
Union is full drink in Harry's.
Take no chances, carry a bottle
of whisky in case you wind up
sober at midnight and if your
bank manager complains, hit
him on the head with the empty
bottle. Yours faithfully
