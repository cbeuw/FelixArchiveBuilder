More Southside Gripes
This week the windows are due
to be cleaned in Southside, and
notes have been posted around
the place asking the residents to
clear the window seats and to
lock all their personal possess-
ions in their wardrobes. Leaving
aside the fact that most people
have already filled their ward-
robes with clothes, couldn't the
massive inconvenience have
been avoided by cleaning the
windows two weeks ago, during
the vacation, when there were
very few people in residence?
S t i l l , students' convenience
doesn't count for much these
days.
Nevertheless, there is an even
more incredible aspect of the
window cleaning: it was stated
on the circular that rooms would
occasionally be left unlocked.
After all the ballyhoo about how
important it is never to leave

rooms unlocked, it's a bit daft to
actually advertise that they will
be left open by posting a note up
in all the halls. D o you imagine
it was coincidence that it was
this week that an undesirable
character was caught visiting
every room in Southside?
Clash of Events
RCS secretary Chas Fuller has
excelled even himself in arrang-
ing the RCS annual dinner on
the same day as Guilds' Dinner
and Dance. Considering these
are two of the most important
social events in the calendar, one
might have expected some sort
of liaison between the CCUs.
For those of you on the horns of
a dilemma over which to attend,
I could offer some advice, but in
fairness to R C S I suppose I
ought not to.
Advertising Manager
Nick Thexton feels that he can
no longer continue as F E L I X
Advertising Manager because of
pressure o f work. This job
involves writing to large com-
panies, visiting local shops and
restaurants, and u s i n g any
method possible to get paid
adverts for F E L I X .
Also, although a couple of
students have s h o w n some
interest in the jobs of What's On
Coordinator and Staff Photo-
grapher, advertised last week,
the posts have not been finally
allocated yet, Anyone interested
in any of the three jobs should
see me in the F E L I X Office as
soon as possible.

I ' M G L A D T O see the silly
season is well under way, with
Union officers posting bricks,
w i l d a n i m a l s r o a m i n g the
corridors of power, and so on,
and so forth. Even arch-loony
Nick Gardner has been doing his
bit. For those of you who aren't
acquainted with this extraordin-
ary character, he is a middle-
aged, fairly well-dressed gentle-
man who used to hang around
the Union bar (until he was
banned by Stephen Goulder)
and on occasion around the
more 'sensitive' areas oi College
(until he was banned by John
Smith).
As i f this unique double
wasn't enough to establish his
credentials as a bit of a nutcase,
he went on to fall hopelessly in
love with the nearest woman to
hand, who happened to be
Caroline G o d i n , last year's
F E L I X business manager. Nick
took great pride in presenting his
inamorata with a wide assort-
ment of surprise presents: not
flowers, or chocolates, or
anything so utterly convention-
al, but an ashtray, ~ j.;ir of
secateurs, and an ironing board
cover. A l l useful and generous
gifts, to be sure, but not quite the
accepted route to a girl's heart.
Anyway, all this happened last
year, and Nick has been absent
from IC for a while. Last week,
though, he put in a reappearance
to see some old friends in the
H G Wells S o c i e t y . He has
acquired a new girlfriend in
C z e c h o s l o v a k i a , and he has
asked the officers of Wellsoc if

FELIXI
IT W A S IN the Christmas issue
of F E L I X that the following
small ad appeared:
t r a n c e , 2 : 3 0 p m , W e d n e s d a y s , o r
8:00pm round my place. Kev the S e c .
• E T — W h y bother to see the film when
you can come to the lectures!
• A l a n Pearaokn, O A P , S O A X ; Merry
Christmas from j o e , Roger and Luke.
Since then, students of no less
than five different disciplines
have assured me that it must
have referred to Professor So-
and-so of their department, who
l o o k s exactly like E T . I ' m
intrigued by this: is IC really
crawling with dozens of replicas
of the wrinkled little alien, all of
them masquerading as doddery
professors? S h o u l d Steven
Spielberg make ET2 at Imperial,
thereby saving his special effects
team millions of dollars? I ' l l
offer a Jingles haircut voucher to
anyone who sends information
(preferably a photograph) of any
member of IC staff who bears
reasonable resemblance to the
film star, and I'll print the best in
a few weeks' time.
A F A I R L Y S T A N D A R D
project for graphic designers is
to produce a symbol for a
lavatory door which will indicate
to persons s p e a k i n g many
languages and none that the
room is for gentlemen only. New
signs have recently been fitted to
the lavatories i n Chem E n g ,
which not only convey this fact,
but also portray with startling
directness just what the gentle-
men are supposed to use the
room for. One can only wonder
what the sign on the ladies' loo is
like!
