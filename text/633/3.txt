agreed that 'throwing shit does
not impress MPs'. Mr Goulder
then wrote to the Constituent
College Unions informing them
that in his opinion the battle
should be discontinued. 'Gone
are the days when students could
indulge in organised vandalism',
he told FELIX. Mr Goulder has
never taken part in the battle.
For the last eight years, teams
from the CCUs have fought for
possession of the Morphy Oar
by flinging revolting substances
at each other, to the displeasure
of the local residents of Putney,
who would find the remaining
mess on the tow-path the
following morning, This year the
RCSU fire-engine, Jez, was used
to hose down the tow-path after
the battle, but the cleaning was
not as thorough as had been
hoped.
Another factor influencing Mr
Goulder's decision is the ex-
pense to the Union; the event is
funded by ICU Rag, and not by
the CCUs. Last term £44 was
spent on dustbin lids to be used
as shields and £300 of damage
was caused to one of the Union
vans. In addition, the oar was
broken and most of it has since
been stolen.
The decision to ban the tow-
path battle will not affect the
rowing which also takes place on
Morphy Day. Plans to move the
event to Harlington sports
ground are unlikely to go ahead
as there is no river there!
NUS Survey of
IC Students
Imperial College has been
chosen as one of sixty institutes
of higher education to partici-
pate in a survey of students'
living standards in Britain. The
National Union of Students has
commissioned the survey from
the Survey Research Unit at the
Polytechnic of North London as
part of a review of the present
system of grants. The results will
probably influence the NUS's
response to the government's
projected student loan scheme.
Although Imperial College has
not been affiliated to the NUS
for five years, the Union has
agreed to assist in the survey
which coincides with one curr-
ently being organised by the
College's External Affairs
Committee. Some seventy-five
NUS questionnaires and ISO of
the College's own will be sent to
randomly selected students.
Sovereign
Switchboard
The telephone switchboard at the
Sovereign Hotel has been reconn-
ected and students can now
receive incoming calls in their
rooms.
' The Sovereign is the smaller of
the College's two new head
tenancies, and its forty eight
students, mostly postgraduates,
have been unable to receive
incoming calls until now. It has
taken three months and the
combined efforts of Lillian
Harrison, the student manager
of the hotel, and Michael
Arthur, the Student Services
Officer, to have the system
restored.
The switchboard was original-
ly disconnected early last term
by the warden, Andy Walker,
and the hotel's proprietors, who
will pay the hundred pound
reconnection fee.
The hotel now has four lines
which wil be operated by the
residents between 6:00 and
10:00pm every evening. The new
numbers are 01-370 6244/5 and
01-370 6255/6.
Welfare Officer
Posts a Brick
FELIXI
A group of "financial planners"
have again been entering the
halls of residence. They offer
dubious financial services' and
have in the past caused consider-
able nuisance, resulting in their
ejection from the buildings.
Welfare Officer Jon Barnett here
demonstrates one of the more
effective methods of discouraging
their return - mail then a brick!
(using their 'reply paid' post-
card, of course)
New Girl in Student Services
The Student Services Office now
has a full-time Welfare Advisor,
a post which has been vacant
since Sue Telling left in June of
last year. She is Karen Stott, and
she will be available in the
Student Services Office to deal
with students' pro'blems on
private sector accommodation,
grants, social security, and other
related matters. Karen has
previously had experience of this
type of work when she was
saobatical Education and Wel-
fare Officer at the University of
Wales at Bangor, where she took
a degree in history.
Since leaving there she has
completed a one year teacher
training course at Ormskirk, but
decided early on that she didn't
want to become a teacher
because she 'couldn't stand
working in a school.' Since
finishing this course she has been
unemployed for seven months.
She was described as 'efficient
and hard-working—not at all
suitable for the job' by Gary
Turner, another Student Serv-
ices employee. (Gary was later
described as the 'resident office
slob' by Student Services Officer
Michael Arthur.) Karen's first
impression of the Student
Services office was that it
provides a good service to IC
students, comparing favourably
with similar services at Bangor,
Of Imperial College she thought
it was 'strange', citing the
male/female ratio and the fact
that the College does not play as
much of a central role in the
social lives of IC students as
might be expected.
Pimlico Connects
Award
The Pimlico Connection Society
and the Communication of
Scientific Ideas Course have
received joint recognition from
the 'Education for Capability'
movement of the Royal Society
for the Arts. Their joint course is
now one of the few schemes in
the country to have the approval
of the RSA in that it represents a
practical and innovative app-
roach to learning.
The recognition was formally
noted at a presentation cere-
meny on December 7 at which
Lord Seebohm presented a
certificate to Dr Sinclair Good-
lad and four officers of the
Pimlico Connection. After the
presentation they outlined their
work and the Department of
Humanities' Communication of
Scientific Ideas course to an
audience of over two hundred
from the press, education,
industry, and commerce.
