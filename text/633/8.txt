Eating Raoui(18) directed by Paul Bartel,
now showing at The Gate Notting Hill and
The Classic Oxford Street.
Spanning the yawning gap between tasteless
farce and pointed satire, Eating Raoul is a
difficult film to categorize.
Bartel (a Corman stable director whose
surprise hit was Death Race 2000) stars as
Paul Bland, an extremely prissy middle aged
man who, along with his equally reserved wife
Mary, dreams of opening his own high class
restaurant. The problem is that they need to
'raise money quickly to escape from torment in
an apartment block infested with partying
'swingers' whose morals they detest. After
being ripped off and abused they hit upon a
novel scheme to make easy money; by luring
swingers to their room with a tempting ad in
the local perv's column and then bashing them
ever so neatly with Paul's frying pan, they
discover that they can unload their fat wallets.
This, of course, gives Bartel the excuse to
include some hilarious bedroom scenes with
various weirdos acting out their bizarre
fantasies before being bopped at the crucial
momeVit. When a handsome hustler, Raoul,
discovers their scheme he offers to dispose of
the bodies, but soon things start to go wrong.
Eating Raoul definitely has an air of its own.
Whether it is a comment on modern-day
America or just a clever farce isn't important.
Paul and Mary Bland discover the means to achieve their dream. The unsung star of the
film is a large, black frying-pan (bottom left).
It does prove to be a pleasing black comedy,
with a good performance by Bartel and Mary
Woronov as the happy couple, but the visual
gags in no way make up for the absence of
witty dialogue. The film relies far too much on
parodying a sex farce (to good effect) but
ignores a wealth of opportunities for some
good, sick jokes. Still, a bit of a laugh and
interesting too.
