The Horns of
Uncertainty
2: Dilemma
Covenants —
a gift from the taxman
If your parents contribute to
your grant, you can use a
covenant as a painless way of
increasing the money that they
give you by 43%.
Covenants were developed as
a means of aiding tax-exempt
people of which impecunious
students are the prime example.
The idea of a deed of covenant
in this context is quite simply
that our parents commit to
writing an undertaking to pay a
certain sum of money each year
for a period capable of exceeding
six years. This does not commit
your parents to actually paying
you for six years, it is merely a
legal requirement of covenants
that they must be capable of
exceeding six years. After each
payment you get a form from the
tax office, fill it in and return it
to your tax office and they wil
then refund you the basic rate
tax that your parents have
already paid on the moneyu that
you receive under the covenant.
Do not be put off if it sounds
complicated and legalistic — we
have a simple deed of covenant
you can copy out and once
signed covenants are very simple
to administer as the hundreds of
students who have already
benefited from them can vouch.
P a g e 2 | •January 21, 19631
Points to note
1. To benefit from a covenant
you must be over 18 or married.
2. Your parents must be paying
tax and you not paying tax.
3. The amount covenanted — ie
what you get from your parents
plus what you get from the
taxman — counts as your earned
income. This means that if the
money you receive under the
covenant plus any other income
you have during the year such as
vacation earnings exceeds your
Personal Tax Allowance (£1565
for single people) then you will
have to start paying tax on the
excess. This position has been
further complicated this year by
the taxing of some social security
benefits so it is wise to do your
sums first. The Student Services
Office can help you with this.
4. Covenants can be drawn up at
any time of the year and at any
point in the student's course, but
for maximum benefit the earlier
the better.
5. The covenant can be cancelled
by mutual consent at any time.

Office, 15 Princes Gardens, any
time between 9.30am and 6pm
and we can give you a fact-sheet
with all the details you need to
know.
