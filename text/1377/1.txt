The Union is
going green
(at long last)
A new environmental policy has
been passed by Union Council in
the wake of Green Week; the policy
had more than 1,300 signatories
supporting its aims. This is around
the same number of people who
voted in this year’s sabbatical elec-
tions, and more than the number of
people who voted for John Collins
last year.
The policy commits the Union
to reducing its environmental im-
pact in a number of areas; these
include waste reduction, water
use, carbon emissions from Union
services and premises, energy, and
transportation.
Overall aims
The policy sets out a number of con-
crete aims: reduction of waste sent
to landfill by the Union by 50% by
2010; reduction of water consump-
tion by use of water conservation
devices (for example, in toilets); and
a 60% reduction in carbon emission
by 2009, with carbon-neutral status
being achieved by 2012.
Waste reduction
Council was told that the Union
produces a great deal of unneces-
sary waste. For example, plastic
disposable skiffs are used every
night in the Union, resulting in a
large amount of plastic waste. The
policy recommends that these are
switched for harder-wearing reusu-
able plastic skiffs. The Union will
also see the return of real cutlery
(including metal utensils and ce-
ramic plates) rather than the low-
quality plastic cutlery currently
used. The last time this idea was
tried, a good deal of this cutlery
vanished, presumably the work of
light-fingered students.
More recycling provision is
promised, as well as a composting
scheme for food waste from cater-
ing. Maybe the Union can use this
to improve the sickly grass in the
Quad.

which considered the impact of brain-to-computer interfaces

Water use reduction
Low flow rate heads will be installed
into all Beit Hall showers, and the
new toilets being installed into the
main building will have infra-red
activated taps, and water-efficient
urinals.
A “grey water” scheme was pro-
posed by the policy, which would
use rainwater from guttering to act
as toilet flush water, but this has
proved somewhat controversial
due to the potential high cost of im-
plementing this scheme (according
to the Union’s architects).
