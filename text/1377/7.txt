Chechnya’s new dictator
The Parliament of the federal state
of Chechnya voted in Vladimir Pu-
tin’s nominee for the post, Ramzan
Kadyrov, as its new president this
month.Kadyrov has been prime
minister since his father, Akhmed,
was assassinated in 2004. Akhmed
Kadyrov was a leading separatist,
fighting for Chechen independence,
until 1999, when he defected and be-
came staunchly pro-Russian.
In 2003, Akhmed was elected as
president with Kremlin support,
and was notorious for his alleged
methods of suppressing rebellious
tensions in the troubled region,
including kidnapping, torture, and
murder.
“Illegal interrogation methods
and torture are routine in Chech-
nya” said Council of Europe Hu-
man Rights Commissioner Thomas
Hammarberg last Thursday with
respect to the nomination.
Ramzan Kadyrov, who turned
the legal presidential age of 30 last
month, is seen as a strong leader,
and has widespread support in
Grozny, and most importantly, in
Moscow. He pledged in an inter-
view with Russian news agency
Interfax,
“I will do my best to quickly re-
solve the problems daily encoun-
tered by people in Chechnya”.
He also has de facto sovereignty
in the region, where he controls a
private militia, known as the “Kady-
rovsty”, as well as deployed Rus-
sian troops, used to combat separa-
tist movement. His and his father’s
rule have brought stability to the
war torn state, but bitterness still
runs deep, especially as the rebels
see the Kadyrovs as traitors.

flicts in the last decade or so. Rus-
sia sent troops into the area in 1994
when the state attempted to secede
from the Federation. The fighting
lasted for two years until Boris
Yeltsin was forced to sign a cease-
fire. Russian forces, though larger
in size and better equipped, were
overwhelmed by the guerilla tactics
used by the separatists. Chechnya
gained independence temporarily,
though not officially recognised by

any other government except the
Taliban in Afghanistan.
In 1999, just prior to Yeltsin’s
surprise resignation, Russia re-
entered the state, destroying the
local regime, and installing a more
favourable government.
The fight for independence in
Chechnya has lasted for centuries,
since the Tsars’ expansion into
the Caucaus mountains in the 18th
century. Chechnya’s population is
historically Muslim, and is now al-
most entirely so. There have been
some Russian based accusations of
forced migration of non-Muslims in
the early 1990s just as Soviet Rus-
sia was being dismantled, which
in turn lead to most non-Muslims
leaving. As well as religious differ-
ences, Chechens still hold other
deep grudges against Moscow for
its often brutal treatment. Stalin
expelled the entire population to
Siberia in 1944 when it was believed
they were aiding the Germans,
leading to the estimated death of a
quarter of their peoples.

Bodies from the Rwandan Genocide, indistinguishable from any other massacre in human history
C
hechnya has always
been in Russia’s sphere
of control. The inter-
national community,
needing Russia as a
Security Council nation, is crippled
to do anything about it, and will re-
main so until some power arises
to shift the diplomatic favour away
from Russia. This happens even for
the worst sorts of crimes against
other human beings that are imagi-
nable. If not America, then who?
Rwanda, Armenia, Sebrenica,
Auschwitz. Just a few names that I
need to remind you of, not because
you don’t know them anyway, but
because we may forget. Allowing
the dominant culture to grow be-
yond all constraints of power can
lead to evils that the current soci-
ety can no longer see, because it
has been desensitised. Be it in the
office, at work, Union Council, NUS
faction politics (by the way it seems
to mostly be Labour vs. the Left),
we have to constantly analyse why
we do what we do.
What a long term. I’ve been deliv-
ering babies and getting mistaken
for a registrar on a HUGE number
of occasions. Turns out medicine
seems to be liking me after all
(must be the beard and the grey
hair). I just heard that a good mate
is also coming into the tribe – wel-
come. We are people like no other.
There are few moments in history
when people can look back, and tru-
ly feel horror, disgust, and regret
because of the actions of their fel-
low men. “The Rwandan Genocide”
in 1994 is one such moment.
The mass extermination of hun-
dreds of thousands of ethnic Tutsis
and moderate Hutu Sympathizers
in Rwanda was the largest atrocity
during the Rwandan Civil War. This
genocide was mostly carried out by
two extremist Hutu militia groups,
the Interahamwe and the Impuza-
mugambi, during a period of about
100 days from April 6 through mid-
July 1994. Over 500,000 Tutsis and
thousands of moderate Hutus died
in the genocide with some reports
estimating the number of victims to
be between 800,000 and 1,000,000.
In the wake of the Rwandan Gen-
ocide, the United Nations and the
international community in general
drew severe criticism for its inac-
tion. Despite international news
media coverage of the violence as it
unfolded, most countries, including
France, Belgium, and the United
States, declined to intervene or
speak out against the massacres.
Canada continued to lead the UN
peacekeeping force in Rwanda,
United Nations Assistance Mission
for Rwanda (UNAMIR). However,
the UN did not authorize UNAMIR
to intervene or use force to prevent
or halt the killing.
political moderates irrespective of
their ethnic backgrounds. Large
numbers of opposition politicians
were also murdered.
Many nations evacuated their na-
tionals from Kigali and closed their
embassies as violence escalated.
National radio urged people to stay
in their homes, and the govern-
ment-funded station RTLM broad-
cast vitriolic attacks against Tutsis
and Hutu moderates. Hundreds of
roadblocks were set up by the mili-
tia in the capital
After losing the Battle of Mogad-
ishu in Somalia, the US refused to
provide requested material aid to
Rwanda. France, China, and Rus-
sia opposed involvement in what
was seen as an “internal affair”.
Dallaire was directly “taken to
task,” in his words, for even sug-
gesting that UNAMIR should raid
Hutu militants’ weapons caches,
whose location had been disclosed
to him by a government informant.
The UN “failed” to respond ad-
equately to Dallaire’s urgent re-
quests. In the US, President Bill
Clinton and US Ambassador to the
UN Madeleine Albright refused
to take action Only Belgium had
asked for a strong UNAMIR man-
date, but after the gruesome mur-
der of the ten Belgian peace keep-
ers protecting the Prime Minister
in early April, Belgium pulled out of
the peacekeeping mission.
With the return of the refugees,
the government began the long-
awaited genocide trials, which had
an uncertain start at the end of 1996
and inched forward in 1997. In 2001,
the UN set up the International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, cur-
rently based in Arusha, Tanzania.
The UN Tribunal has jurisdiction

ernment and armed forces, while
Rwanda is responsible for prose-

fuelling the First and Second Con-
go Wars. Rivalry between Hutu and
Tutsi tribal factions is also a major
factor in the Burundi Civil War.
MRND, the ruling party of
Rwanda from 1975 to 1994, under
President Juvénal Habyarimana,
has been implicated in organizing
many aspects of the Genocide. Mili-
