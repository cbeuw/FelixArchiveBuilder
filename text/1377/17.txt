Danish cinema is something that I
imagine must be quite new to most
people, including myself. While
Lars Von Trier has moved to Hol-
lywood and been brought to public
attention, the industry itself seems
to be pretty unknown. After the
Wedding however seems to have
been advertised quite widely, giv-
en its origins, so I figured it’d be a
good place to start learning. Sadly,
it’s not exactly a shining new force
in World Cinema.
Don’t get me wrong, I’m not
trashing the whole Danish film
industry and on closer inspection
of the film it becomes clear why
some distributor thought now
might be the time to export in this
direction. The main draw here is
Mads Mikkleson, recently exposed
to Western audiences as villain Le
Chiffre in Bond flick, Casino Roy-
ale, so now seems a sensible time
to capitalise on his international
recognition. In all honesty, it’s also
the best point of the film so it’s not
all in vain.
After the Wedding sees a Dan-
ish orphanage worker (Mikkelson)
in India invited back to his home-
land to secure financing for the or-
phanage from a rich businessman.
Reluctant at first, he eventually
repents and travels to Denmark
where said businessman invites
him to his daughter’s wedding
that weekend to pass the time on
his stay. However, when he shows
up, it seems there is more to come
than a certain business deal as he
finds his ex-girlfriend married to
his financier. Cue the resurfacing
emotions, hidden secrets and fam-
ily torment.
It does all sound a bit like an ITV
drama premiere but it has a slight-
ly different style. If David Lynch
makes films seemingly inspired
by LSD fuelled hallucinations, the
director of this offering, Susanne
Bier, could be accused of being on
speed or at least a daily breakfast
of ten espresso shots. The camera
never stands still; new characters
have 360 degree sweeps around
them, there’s a cut every few sec-
onds and the whole thing moves at
incredible pace. Having not been
introduced to Danish film prior to
this, I am left wondering if this is
a national technique like the jump
cut of the French New Wave or
simply one woman’s inability to
stand still.
This did dominate my thoughts
throughout the film and the plot
seemed to move as fast as the cam-
era. Anyone who said European
films are dull and slow weren’t in-
troduced to this. The saving grace
here is the acting which shows
some great talent, not only from
MadsbutfromSidseBabetteKnud-
sen also, playing the old flame,
Helene. They have real chemistry
and both fill their character with
a real sense of people with a past,
and are matched all the way by
Helene’s husband, played by Rolf
Lassgard. This lifts it beyond the
dreaded TV drama status.
In all fairness, this was an alright
film. Nothing too special, but per-
haps it’s unfair to judge it as typi-
cally representative of a country’s
cinema. After all, when people
judge French cinema they’ll trawl
through history to find something,
not nip off down the multiplex and
watch Orchestra Seats. This is
more of the latter I imagine and
Danish cinema has contributed to
the art in the form of the Dogme
’95 movement, something that was
just overlooked here because of its
minimalist style at a time when we
were obsessed with special effects-
laden eye candy.
The highlight is definitely the
surprising performance of Mikkel-
son that can’t help but leave you
thinking he was criminally under-
used in Casino Royale. But then
again, that’s one of the Bond fran-
chise trademarks whenever it gets
a great actor. This is a much bet-
ter acting showcase. Plus, any film
that manages to play “It’s Raining
Men” twice without incurring any
homosexual undertones must have
artistic ability.
Well done Denmark.

Of all the categories of Academy
Award, the one most likely to be
given to the least deserving person
is that of Best Original Score.
This year, for example, it went to
Gustavo Santaolalla for his work on
Babel, a score matched in its mind-
numbing blandness and formulaic
monotony only by the film itself, the
only message of which seemed to
be that all people are inconsider-
ate pricks who make stupid deci-
sions (rather than having anything
to do with language barriers as the
publicity and title had led us all to
believe).
Santaolalla’s previous works in-
clude the similarly unimpressive
score to Brokeback Mountain,
which unaccountably won the
previous year’s Oscar, and North
Country, whose score was so ap-
palling as to distract from the film
itself. Amongst other crimes, it
made use of the standard opening-
pan-across-epic-landscape-while-
the-credits-appear cliché of a bog-
standard lazy faux-epic piece with
loud thumping beats with exces-
sive levels of reverb and delay, the
likes of which only ever appear in
films (almost invariably shit ones,
at that). This sort of nonsense
never pervades music for home lis-
tening, and with good reason - no-
one in their right minds would wish
to sit down and listen to it, and it
amazes me that anyone could think
it works in a filmic context.
What makes the success of Ba-
bel’s score all the more galling is
that one of its fellow nominees for
the award was Philip Glass’s as-
tounding score to Notes on a Scan-
dal - a work which manages to be
striking and evocative without rub-
bing emotion into the audience’s
ears. That such an outstanding
work can be overlooked in favour of
one so uninspired seems a terrible
injustice.
Even then, at least it was nomi-
nated - the finest score of last year
by a country mile, that of The Foun-
tain, didn’t even receive a nod.
Clint Mansell’s profoundly inspir-
ing score, beautifully performed by
The Kronos Quartet and Mogwai,
is one of a rare few that eclipse the
film for which they were composed
(Mansell’s previous work on Req-
uiem for a Dream is another, so
iconic has that become while the
film remains relatively obscure),
yet received no recognition by the
major awards other than a Golden
Globe nomination.
Though it’s hardly surprising that
such standout works would receive
no recognition from the Academy
Awards and the like - John Williams,
responsible for a couple of hum-
mable tunes over the years though
hardly anything award-worthy, has
the most Oscar nominations of
anyone other than Walt Disney and
receives at least one nomination
every year on average. Clearly, the
Academy values soulless bombast
over anything truly original or com-
pelling, though the general dearth
of worthwhile scores may be in
some way to blame.
It’s no surprise, then, that many
directors are accustomed to stick-
ing to one composer for most of
their scores - Gabriel Yared and
Anthony Minghella (whose reliance
on a single composer for his scores
was described by one reviewer on
Radio 4 as ‘unique’, in a startling
subversion of the word ‘unique’);
DarrenAronofskyandClintMansell
(the partnership responsible for the
aforementioned scores by Mansell);
Tim Burton and, unaccountably, the
suicidally twee Danny Elfman; etc.
Inevitably, variety is likely to suffer
as a result, though some screen
composers have sufficient breadth
of style to prevent this. Williams
and Elfman, alas, are not amongst

“I wish we hadn’t picked “It’s Raining Men” for our first dance”
Hugh Stickley Mansfield these, though bizarrely enough,
Philip Glass is, despite the core of
every work of his - whether for the
screen or not - being comprised of
constant repetitive arpeggios to an
almost fetishistic extent. That he
is capable of subtle differences be-
tween scores puts him above most
other screen composers in itself,
since any form of subtlety is beyond
them.
Given that the films they score
lack subtlety, this style is clearly
perfect for them, but it certainly
isn’t worthy of recognition, let alone
an Oscar.
