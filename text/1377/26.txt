It seems my first Felix crossword
has been judged worthy of being
the last one of term, which fills
me with inexpressable joy. And
speaking of joy, there’s plenty for
everyone else, too!
There isn’t a theme, some of the
words go down, and none of the
answers are in foreign languages,
so I hope that’ll help - I wouldn’t
want to make it too tricky for any-
one, since we’re not all bilingual
(and some of us don’t even speak
English).
Oh, and there’s a bonus prize for
the first person to work out where
a couple of ‘special’ clues came
from. A special bonus prize.

Aquarius (20 Jan – 18 Feb)
What did I say? What
did I fucking say? I
explicitly told you to
call me! I am now on
pills for my nerves
because of you. Why
do you hate me? Did you get those
flowers I sent? It’s not every day
that I reach out. Why do you do this
to me? I’m leaving.
Capricorn (22 Dec – 19 Jan)
Why didn’t you call
me? I was up all last
night waiting for you
to ring, I read last
week’s Felix eighty-
two times whilst wait-
ing for your call. Did I not make
myself clear enough? I told you to
call me. I called your parents, they
said you were ‘out’. Call me yeah?
Sagittarius (22 Nov – 21 Dec)
You know what, my
little friend, maybe it’s
just my man-nipples
tingling around this
time of year, but I feel
quite relaxed around
you. Could we hang out sometime?
We could go bowling and talk about
girls and have a few beers. I genu-
inely mean this, call me okay?
Scorpio (23 Oct – 21 Nov)
You’re not from
around here are you?
Well, let me introduce
you to the team: over
there is Horace, he’s a
researcher into plate
tectonic shifts and resulting animal
migration; stood next to him is
Phil, he’s technical support; and
over there is Steve, he’s a prick.
This Week’s Horny Goats
Gemini (22 May – 21 Jun)
That last horoscope
was a bit limp. It was
as limp as an aged
pig’s snout when
ready for consumption
in some third world
country that only epileptics can
pronounce. If you are from a third
world country, I do apologise, if not,
haha, look at that dirty, skinny guy.
Taurus (21 Apr – 21 May)
I like to imagine peo-
ple as pigeons. Yeah,
just walking around
pecking at fag-ends
with gammy legs. I
told my therapist this
and he then began pecking at my
feathers. This other guy fashioned
a house out of newspaper, actually
he was just a hobo.
Aries (21 Mar – 20 Apr)
I’m an Aries, me. My
birthday is 13th April,
which is cool because
1+3 is 4 and the 4th
month is April. I was
also born in 1986 and
1+9+8+6 is 24 which is 13 (my
birthday)+11, and 1+1 is 2 and
2+11 is 13! I’m magic! Now will you
please call me?
Pisces (19 Feb – 20 Mar)
ARGGGGGGHHHH-
HHHHHHHHHHHH-
HHH HERE COMES
THE PAIN!!!!!!!!!! I’M
GONNA STAB YOU
UP
, I’M GONNA GIVE
YOU NEW ORIFICES AND THEN
POUR PAIN UPON YOUR FAM-
ILY! FUCKING CALL ME YOU
SPANISH PIG-DOG.
Libra (23 Sept – Oct 22)
I know what you’re
thinking, you’re think-
ing scientistic isn’t a
real word. Well, you’re
wrong! Scientistic is
a word and it means
believing firmly in the scientific
method. Go back to pre-school
you mere dumbfounded child in a
world of superfluous verbosity.
Virgo (23 Aug – 22 Sept)
This one goes out
some bearded girl
who spoke to me at
their hall’s pirate par-
ty. You seemed very
friendly even though
you seemed nervous talking to me.
Don’t be nervous, I’ve been tested
and it came out neutral. The scien-
tistic community were baffled.
Leo (23 Jul – 22 Aug)
I read the news today,
oh boy, four thousand
holes in Blackburn,
Lancashire.That’s
what I call social jus-
tice. See, I can do geo-
graphical satire. Now I will be topi-
cal: so Trident is being renewed, I
have a destructive weapon in need
of upgrading for one lucky lady.
Cancer (22 Jun – 22 Jul)
OHHHHH MISS
LADYYYYYY
MA’AAAAAAM! I love
Lady & The Tramp,
an epoch-making film
that inspired many
a homeless guy to rape a young
Sloaney princess. My homeless
person mentioning quota is up this
week fuckers!

What the jizz do you
need a jotting pad
for? You do realise
that every single row,
column and box con-
tains the same munt-
ing digits, right? Oh,
and the hidden word
isn’t “tubesock”. Pile
of cocknobbers.
