single reviews
The exclamation mark was intro-
duced to English printing in the
1400s and it officially stopped being
cool exactly 5 minutes later, so why
this band felt it was appropriate
to defile their name with this foul
blemish is completely beyond me,
unless of course they are just try-
ing to distract me from the fact that
their music is absolutely abysmal.
Dartz! are the archetypal pub
rock band that somehow managed
to transcend selling casettes out of
the boot of their mum's car after a
gig at the local social club and land
on the pages of the NME by plaster-
ing their releases with unnecessary
punctuation and shouting meaning-
less bullshit over the top of a gener-
ic guitar/bass/drums setup.
One of the few songs on this record
which approaches listenability is
the ludicrously titled Prego Trian-
golos, with its jerky angular guitars,
but it is unfortunately let down by
an inexplicable chorus of shouting
over hand claps ("You have three
sides, but you're not a triangle."
Deep.) The internet tells me that
Once, Twice, Again! was released
as a single (hence the exclamation
mark), so I guess that if for some
reason you enjoy listening to this
band then you will like it (in fair-
ness, at least on this song they try
– badly – to sing properly instead of
just shouting like drunken louts).
If you think I've been a little harsh
about Dartz!, well, I have; in fact, a
lot of this album is simply mediocre
and not nearly as atrocious as might
previously have been suggested.
Other single St. Petersburg is defi-
nitely listenable, as are many of the
others, it's just that there's really
nothing to lift this album above the
rest of the seemingly endless wave
of identical bands all desperately
fighting over some modest degree
of success with those more con-
cerned with style than substance in
their music.

Dart For My Sweetheart

★★★★★
Deftones have been around the
block a fair few times but surpris-
ingly after five albums and 18
years in the business these aging
masters have never really altered
their sound. Mein is a testiment
to how talented the group is, less
the polish the track could happily
sit anywhere in the bands discog-
raphy. Taken from the fith studio
Being initiated into the South Lon-
don crew this year I have immedi-
ate 'respec' for the Archie Bronson
Outfit simply because they are local,
to me that is. The first time I ever
heard of the band was on an advert
on TV, ever since I have been mildly
amused by their sound and listened
intently to a selection of their mu-
sic. The intrigue continues with this
single release. Guilty of poor com-
parisons the sound is like a English
version of Kings of Leon, only origi-
nal and with a twist of Electrelane
to spice things up. Rhythmic and
addictive Dart for My Sweetheart
is a low drone of a song, deep and
original it goes against the grain by
being a critically acclaimed band
that is actually good. The B-Sides
are a good support, In The Shad-
ow Of Love is reminiscent of the
mournful blues that added so much
character to the first Von Bondies
album, while Fire House provides
yet another dose of depressed joy.
Forgot the Kooks, the Fratellis and
all that bollocks because this IS new
music, not rehashed tripe.

album review
looks like a car, it has an engine and
steering wheel like a car, but it is in
fact a pile of fucking shit. The per-
ceptive among you may be guess-
ing I am going to say the Kissaway
Trail's debut album is a Lada, well I
am not, because at least a Lada has
some function, while this piece of
musical mush is a lie, a complete,
hideous, Danish lie.
But why I hate the Kissaway Trail
may not be immediately apparent
on first listen to the album. There
is nothing wrong with the band, the
music is likable, the songs are lush
and developed, thoughtful lyrics
and organ are all there but why do I
hate this band so? Because they are
a complete fucking rip of the Arcade
Fire – just with more cheese. Forev-
er Turned Out To Be Too Long, the
opening track, could be mistaken
for an Arcade Fire cover band and
the following Smother+Evil = Hurt
is equally as misleading.
If you have never heard the Ar-
cade Fire then you’re safe, you
will probably like this album, it is
relatively easy going and twee, the
twenty somethings who make up
the band can certainly play their in-
struments and put together songs
just not ones which are original.
Props to the band as they have suc-
cessfully captured and mimicked
the sound of their Canadian idols
– even the accent! Let’s just hope
they realise the music is about orig-
inality sometime soon. Oh, but they
do have a nice art direction.

B2K were the urban *NSYNC.
Massively popular for no appar-
ent reason. Okay they could they
could bust a choreographed move
or two but that still doesn’t explain
why teen girls went gaga over
them. Their material, like that of
*NSYNC’s, was pretty generic so it
is still a mystery how they managed
to shift so many albums.
Fronted by moderately talented
singers, the boys cashed in on the
boy band explosion of the nineties
but only the lead singers, Justin
(*NSYNC) and Omarion (B2K),
managed to survive the boy band
massacre of the early noughties.
This makes Omarion the Justin
Timberlake of R&B.
Unlike Justin, Omarion hasn’t
struck platinum with his second
solo offering, yet. Lead single, En-
tourage, was incredibly weak and
very few got to hear it before it sank
without a trace. Luckily, his second
single off 21 isn’t half bad. In fact,
I can’t believe I’m admitting this
outside the safe confines of my bed-
room but it is pretty darn good.
Like JT, Omarion has called in
beat extraordinaire, known to you
and me as Timbaland, for the pro-

album review
duction so it nothing short of in-
credible. It has got ticking and
deep drums and everything you
wouldn’t have thought would work
well together but with a little Timbo
magic do and the big shocker is for
the first the lyrics have depth. He is
pretty clever in his use of Ice Box as
a metaphor for a guarded heart and
he tackles heartache from a new
perspective.
It is a little more subtle in its bril-
liance compared Justin’s My Love
but it gives us a glimpse of how
much better My Love could have
been if the singer had a little more
vocal ability.
Keep an eye out for Solange, Be-
yonce’s little sister, in the video.

Fantasia can sing her butt off. She
proved this so many times on AmI-
dol that now it is pretty much a fact
no one can deny. But now it is time
for her to tackle the second item on
her to-do list in her evolution from
talent competition winner to recog-
nised and acclaimed recording art-
ist – make a breakthrough album.
The second album is usually the
beginning of the end for reality tal-
ent competition winners-that is for
those who manage to make it that
far. Trying to forge a career in the
music industry after winning a show
like American Idol becomes even
harder. There is a desperate need
for contestants to avoid the stigma

This Is My Ship

★★★✩✩
album review
associated with these kinds of com-
petitions and regain the credibility
they lost after releasing a rushed
and hype-driven debut album.
This is no mean feat but ex-Idol
Kelly Clarkson managed what many
considered to be impossible in 2004
with her multi-platinum sophomore
album Breakaway. She capped a
great year off by winning two Gram-
my awards – one from right under
Mariah’s nose. No doubt Fantasia is
hoping for similar success with the
release of her first single from her
sophomore album. Album number
2 is her chance to show the world
she has what it takes to be vital to
the music world and if it bombs it
is going to take a miracle to get her
career back on track, much like the
miracle required to save Jade’s
career.
Fortunately for her, and let’s face
it for us too because you can never
get too much good music, it doesn’t
suck. Hood Boy is a juiced up slice
of urban pop driven by a Supremes’
sample (The Happening). It is a
shout-out to men everywhere in the
same vein as DC’s Soldier and pos-
sesses the boisterousness of Chris-
tina’s Ain’t No Other Man. It is a
loud and fun cut which will plague
your mind for days after you first
hear it.

album, Saturday Night Wrist, the
single is fun and catchy, well as fun
and catchy as one of the founding
fathers of nu-metal breed can get.
This is certainly no 7 Words or
Passenger but Mein cuts its own
niche and is identifiably in its own
right, something that cannot be said
for the releases of many other rock
veterans (I'm look at you RCHP).
The track clocks up only five or so
different lines but the draw of the
thrashing melodys and bare drum-
mings is as strong as ever. Forever
loveable the Deftones are still living
up to the hype.

To the guy in the middle (yes, I know he’s the drummer): “You’re not from round here are you boy?”
