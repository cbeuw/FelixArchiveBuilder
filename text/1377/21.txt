I, Gamer
T
his week I’ve revis-
ited Broken Sword.
Maybe it’s because
it’s one of the first
PC games I played,
but for some reason the Broken
Sword games are quite calm-
ing. The hapless hero George
goes about saving the world
in the kind of nonchalant man-
ner you might expect to see if
David Mitchell was tasked with
saving the world.
Broken Sword is a joy to play
for a lot of reasons. It predates
the hypersuccessful Knights
Templar cash cow by at least
five years, for one thing. But
games of Broken Sword’s gen-
re – one very close to extinction
– always remind me of gaming
before people fussed.
I’m not one of those people
that think modern gaming is a
travesty compared to the 8-bit
days. I’m as glad to have Civ IV
and C&C3 as much as I am to
have the originals. But games
like Broken Sword show a more
comfortable industry, when the
gap between the gamers and
the makers was less.
The last fortnight in gaming
has been racked by infighting
and mudslinging, with the GDC
proving to be the spark for a
whole new wave of console de-
bate. And after the discussion
about the usefulness of the PC,
it’s interesting to talk to old
stalwarts – now turned over to
the consoles, unhappy with the
repetition and sloppiness of PC
design standards.
Take a look at our take on the
debate this week – a report on
the opinions of the GDC, as well
as a slightly more ... opinionat-
ed view. Is the PC platform dy-
ing? Or will games like Spore
and DEFCON keep it in place
as the home of innovation?
If you’ve got some spare cash
hanging around, you might be
interested in our look at Ghost
Recon AW2, too. It’s games like
this that show the intensity that
consoles offer, but is it just the
familiar blowing shit up?
When Felix returns next
term, we’ll have a retro flavour
to the proceedings – probably
picking up on Broken Sword
and its ilk at some point. Should
the PC ever finally cop it, I’ll be
there at the funeral. I’ll say a
few words about the laughs we
had, and how it sold itself out to
get in with the kids, and OD’ed
on Sims expansion packs at
a crazy party. And then we’ll
plant a copy of Monkey Island 2
in the front garden, with a little
plaque.
And I’ll pay a little kid to kick
the XBox in his crotch.

This week in videogaming
O
riginally, there was
some confusion as to
why the PSP hadn’t
been included in
the Playstation3 an-
nouncements of the GDC. This
week though – if rumours are to
be believed – there’s a good reason
for it, namely a successor to Sony’s
dark handheld slice. The PSP 2.0,
according to the gaming blog Ko-
taku that broke the story, claim that
thirdpartyinsidershavebeenprom-
ised a second console, and that an
announcement may come as early
as this year’s E3 event. There’s the
standard claims of better screen
and faster loading times, but what’s
really caught our eye is the possibil-
ity of a built-in camera and – oh-oh
– a built-in touchscreen?
It’s unlikely to emerge for a while,
certainly not before the Playsta-
tion3 debuts its Home software, the
social networking platform that will
play host to all of Sony’s matchmak-
ing shenanigans. Dubbed by Nin-
tendo a ‘Mii too’ attempt, Sony has
defended their ideas, saying that it
gives a far wider and more social
range of things to do, not to men-
tion the suggestion that this tech-
nology had been in development
for some time. Home’s closed beta
begins in late summer with it go-
ing live worldwide before the year
is out. There are fears that it might
impose upon gamers that aren’t so
interested in the new technology,
but Sony’s Phil Harrison seems
confident that it’ll become as key
to the Playstation3 as Live! is to the
XBox 360.
Phil does his best.
What would be your Top 10 of in-
fluential games? This just in – no-
one cares any more. What was once
an age-old discussion and source
of many petty internet debates has
now finally been closed forever with
the opinion of Someone Cleverer
Than You. The curator at Stanford’s
Science and Technology museum
has compiled the top ten of key vid-
eogames, and the choices might
seem a little odd. Some – such as
Civilization or Doom – wouldn’t be
contested by many gamers. Oth-
ers smack a little of obviousness
Guns, football, and Communism – the three ingredients in the modern game?
From top – Doom, Sensible World of Soccer, and Civilization, three of the most influential games ever?
(Spacewar!) and some – Sensible
Soccer – are slightly questionable.
But agree or disagree, Mr. Lowood
is doing some interesting things
with the Museum, petitioning the
Library of Congress and seeking to
preserve the history and culture of
videogaming in the future. Perhaps
exhibitions like Game On won’t be
so uncommon in the future?
And since this is our last issue be-
fore the launch of the Playstation3,
we should point out that the bundles
are very varied, and if you’re hoping
to get one early on, you should shop
around. £555 spent at Game will get
a 60Gb, Call of Duty 3, Resistance:
Fall of Man, and Motorstorm, but we
like Play.com’s pack – £525 will get
you a 60Gb model with Resistance,
MotorStorm and Genji – not a bad
package, especially when you take
into account the bundled HDMI.
Releases this week are yet again
good news for gamers – SSX Blur
for Wii owners, the long-awaited
and much-hyped Spectrobes for the
DS, as well as the new Bomberman
Touch, and our personal favourite
for this week – the sequel to Phoe-
nix Wright – Justice For All, with
more excuses to shout into your DS
on the Tube. Not to mention Pimp
My Ride.
And one final stop press for you
– Microsoft’s Peter Moore has said
the new XBox will likely release in
2011. Just in case you were getting
bored of the next-gen already.
