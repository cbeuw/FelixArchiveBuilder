aculty Elections
F
Thom
Groot
In the 1st year of its new exist-
ence, the RCSU has made an in-
credible contribution to the sci-
ence students.
I believe that if elected as RCSU
President, I will be able to keep
the upward line going, and ensure
that the RCSU will outgun the en-
gineers, miners and medics for
the second year in a row.
A vote for me, is a vote for an ex-
perienced and strong leader.
I have acted as the Chemistry
Dep Rep last year, and have held
various positions in other socie-
ties, taking on responsible roles
and delivering results.
I promise enthusiasm and plen-
ty of hard work for the job in hand.
The RCSU has a big legacy, and
there are some big boots to fill,
however, I am confident I will be
able to keep the RCSU in the top
spot!
Vote Thom for RCSU President!
Jennifer
Morgan
Vote for me! I’m the best, most
experienced candidate! I’m ap-
proachable, dedicated, enthusiastic
and fun! As welfare officer this year
I’ve actively advised students when
problems arose and I’ve successfully
fought for people’s ‘welfare’! I’m
definitely familiar with union politics
- I’m on council, the representation
and welfare board and other funky
committees. I’ve frequently gone the
extra mile to help out the union. I re-
ally care about the RCSU and under-
stand its fragile position in the future.
We’ve done some great things this
year and I’m going to match them
and do better. I know what worked
and what didn’t, and I have plenty of
vision for the RCSU’s future! We still
have to conquer The Savoy and The
Dorchester! We have the power to
represent students and protect their
interests and I want this to be publi-
cised and utilised properly.
150 words just isn’t enough. Email

About voting
If you’re a student doing Maths,
Chemistry, Physics, or Biology
then the RCSU is your Faculty
Union. If you’re an Engineer, or
a Computing Student, then your
Faculty Union is CGCU (below).
The FUs are there to specifi-
cally represent students doing
similar degrees; for example,
they often lobby College and
the greater Union for changes to
benefit their students. They also
have a strong social side, serv-
ing to bind departments together
through various events held dur-
ing the year.
You can vote if you are doing
one of these degrees. To vote,
go to www.imperialcollegeun-
ion.org/vote and sign in with
your College username and
password.

A vote for Tristan Sherliker is a
vote for experience.
The CGCU exists for three major
reasons: for academic representa-
tion, organisation of faculty wide
events, and running of our socie-
ties. I have direct experience with
each aspect: as a YearRep, and Re-
app; having helped organise events
in Halls, Guilds, and College-wide;
and with committee experience on
several societies.
A vote for Tristan Sherliker is a
vote for improvement.
This year some things have been
great, and some poor. As Guild-
sheet editor I’ve been in a position
to see exactly what has gone right
and what has gone wrong, and to
write it down and remember it!
A vote for Tristan Sherliker is a
vote for results.
My experience has always been
devoted towards achieving results,
and never to self-promotion or “un-
ion hackery”. I’m not interested in
constitutional politics if it gets in
the way of what needs to be done.

The CGCU, albeit structurally rigid,
retains much flexibility in the appli-
cation of its work. As each faculty
thrusts its ideas forth, I propose
no withdrawal. I am convinced it is
crucial to develop cohesion in the
intra-faculty policies towards pro-
moting a reinvigorated consensus
spirit at the inter-faculty level, thus
allowing us all to remain on top of
the issues on the agenda.
There lies exciting potential for
initiatives in the penetration of the
inexhaustible issues and projects
within and beyond our faculty.
We may struggle through initial
resolutions as we tackle current
and successive outbursts of new
challenges, from reviving our in-
ternship program to reorganizing
our budget to secure a sabbatical
for the presidential position.
I however reassure you of my
confidence that, in foreplay to our
centennial celebrations next year,
we will climax to some fantastically
palpable results, bringing to frui-
tion the cumulative efforts of years
past.
