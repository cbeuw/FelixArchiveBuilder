Rehab
Judging purely by how
many celebrity's are
jumping on the band-
wagon, rehab is hot right
now. Here's a chicken,
egg dilemma; does ce-
lebrity attract more than
it's fair share of fucked up
people, or does celebrity
fuck people up?
M by Madonna @ H&M
How is Madonna relevant
to a H&M customer? I
don't know how old she
is, but judging from her
hands alone I'd say she's
about 98. She has lost
her cultural relevance
to young women, if she
designs for any brand it
should be Laura Ashley.
Her designs are unorigi-
nal and at best derivative.
Barbie Loves M.A.C
According to M.A.C,
"Barbie is hip, happen-
ing and all M·A·C with a
modern rebel attitude and
fashionable indie style".
How can copywriters
sleep at night knowing
their livelihoods depends
on writing crap like this?
Even more ominous is
the line, "Barbie Loves
M·A·C, a limited edition
colour collection spe-
cially created for all you
living dolls". Did anyone
watch that programme
on Channel 5 (probably)
about men living with life
size dolls? They prob-
ably smear Barbie M.A.C
across their "girlfriends'"
lifeless faces.
Empire line tops
Do designers actu-
ally consider how their
designs will look on an
actual human person
before deeming them fit
for production? These
tops don't even have the
decency to just make you
look pregnant, you just
look fat.

3. Wear with flat sandals and a loose t-shirt for laid back cool. If
you don't have the legs for shorts, just go for cropped. The look
you should be aiming for here is slightly stoned, not hooker, so
don't team short shorts with a tight top and high heels. It's ba-
sic fashion arithmetic really. 2 + 2 equals 5 right? T-Shirt, £12,;

Hot Looks For This Spring
1. I think the brightly coloured nu-rave "trend" is interesting. but I
have yet to see anyone wearing it without looking like a coked-up Eu-
ropean douchebag. I think the opposite way to go is much more inter-
esting, floaty clothes in natural colours. A short, pretty white or cream
cotton dress, can be a versatile and easy look. Team the dress with
tan accessories, like chunky wedge sandals, and this look is golden.

2. I have previously branded high waists as lame, however the key
difference here is the cut. High waisted flares, no. High waisted straight
legged jeans, yes. Actually finding a pair which don't look like some-
thing your mother would've worn in the 90's, with a yard long zip up to
your belly button, proves difficult. Those types of jeans, whose right-
ful home these days lies only in re-runs of Friends, are only a distant
cousin of this seasons high-waisters. Topshop's corset jeans @ £45
are a step in the right direction. Camisole, £12, Topshop; Jeans, £45,
