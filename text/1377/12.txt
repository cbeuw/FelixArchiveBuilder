An album fiesta, not siesta
We’ve got reviews of the second Arcade Fire album, and the new Patrick Wolf album

H
ello darkness, my
old friend. Actu-
ally, the Darkness
weren’t my friends,
they were a joke
gone horribly wrong, so much so
that they actually thought they
were a band so a member left.
The less said about that chapter
in music history, the better.
Anyway, so we have come to
the last issue of term, and what
a term it has been. Or, not, since
it always dawns on people at this
time of year that they need to
actually do some work, and they
have ‘no money’. I often find this
time of year severely lacking in
musical inspiration also.
Christmas is absolutely det-
rimental to the creative juices
and it is because of that horrible
word, money. Gigs die off as pro-
moters don’t want to risk putting
on gigs as people have little
money and might not come out,
and the promoters themselves
don’t want to put their money
on the line in case noone comes.
Gigs tend to pick up at this time
of year and then, before you know
it there is a three-way amazing
show clash like there is tonight
(March 16th).
In Brixton, where I’ll be, at the
Windmill there is the fantastic
Make Believe (same guys as
cap’N Jazz, Owls, Joan of Arc and
Ghosts & Vodka). After Brixton
I shall scuttle off to Highbury &
Islington to the Silver Rocket
club-night where October All
Over, Underground Railroad,
The Sailplanes, and Epideme are
playing at the Buffalo Bar. Whilst
all of this is happening, the fan-
tastic Raccoo-oo-oon will be play-
ing at Barden’s Boudoir in Stoke
Newington. I recommend you go
to at least one of these gigs, but
two of them might be sold out
soon so turn up early. Go now!
I am blabbering on about all
these good gigs and bands so as
to counter-act my recent appear-
ance. I have probably seemed
malevolent in my distain for all
new bands cropping up, but I am
sick of all these fads cropping
up. I want the good old days (the
90s) where bands had tunes and
sustainability, but the millennium
had to come along and so all
music now has to sound ‘progres-
sive’ and ‘modern’, like all this
new vacuous architecture. Maybe
we have reached the pinnacle of
humanity and ideas of the 21st
Century are wishful thinking.
Even though those of you who lis-
tened to and loved Funeral (myself
included) will probably have bought
this album anyway, I thought I'd
write a little something about this
album. It is Arcade Fire's second
album, but I fear will be labeled for-
ever as the 'follow-up' to Funeral for
years to come. Want to know why it
will be eternally lamented this way?
Well, it just leaves me with this void
where emotions should be. What
made the Arcade Fire so adorable
was the fact that they were gran-
diose but retained a subdued aes-
thetic and production value, now
they have indulged in the grandiose
leaving me feel like I have just lis-
tened a Bruce Springsteen album.
If you have ever seen the film High
Fidelity, then this album should
have felt like the scene where our
protagonist is in dialogue with The
Boss, but instead this LP was the
awful dance moves of Courteney
Cox in the video for Dancing in the
Dark.
That first sentence may not have
made much sense I guess, but then
that is true for a lot of things that
I say. I remember on the cool kids
circuit a lot of those people who dis-
liked the Arcade Fire were those
people who just saw them as a poor
imitation of Mercury Rev or Modest
Mouse but with a gothic aesthetic
rather than subdued Mid-Western

album reviews US cool. Despite all of this doubt-
ing, I still maintain that Funeral is
a gorgeous album full of brilliant
songs that have only a shallow simi-
larity to the aforementioned bands.
Funeral was introspective yet out-
going in its optimism and childlike
wonder, it was intricate yet minimal
in its portrayal so as not to blur the
melodies and as mentioned it was
grandiose whilst retaining an or-
ganic lo-fi edge all oozing melodies
and rhythmic punch. These contra-
dictions and walking the fine line
between dramatics and genuinely
moving seem to have been lost and
the line is reduced to a smear. They
are a band suffering from a lack of
definition, and this comes across
in the obscure attacks upon gov-
ernment such as in Black Mirror
("Show me where them bombs will
fail"), and the re-recording of No
Cars Go which appeared on their
debut EP
.
Speaking of vague attacks on the
government, this album reminds
me of Radiohead's dire and for-
gettable effort, Hail To The Thief
with its lack of invention and lack
of tunes. The songs on this album
are okay but they are just that; the
drums are utilitarian which isn't re-
freshing just boring and the chord
sequences are obvious with no
drastic changes in structure or pro-
gression in the songs. I mentioned
Bruce Springsteen earlier and this
comes across via his dull album
Tunnel of Love which is so middle of
the road that it is a splattered squir-
rel with skid-marks across it (listen
to Keep The Car Running). When
the stadium rock is toned down as
in Neon Bible, the repetition of the
title just annoys and I find myself
skipping through it.
This album is frankly a disap-
pointment and I can't help skip-
ping through it until I get to some
of the songs Regine sings, but not
even her quirky yet ultimately ap-
pealing French hybrid singing can
After two albums of moping and in-
trospection, Patrick Wolf has finally
figured out how to write pop songs
and it turns out he's pretty fucking
good at it. Of course, The Magic
Position still has a few moments of
tedious balladry thrown in for those
losers who actually listen to what
he's singing about, but on the whole
this album is packed with the kind
of fun and energy only seen in such
concentration on a handful of tracks
from his previous albums.
Opening track Overture puts a
heavy emphasis on strings, which
play a major role throughout much
of the record and I could go on
about how lush and exciting the
instrumentation is throughout, but
for most people listening the most
important thing by far is going to
be Wolf's guttural crooning, which
sounds more likely to have come

from a 7000-pound rhinoceros than
the gangly 23-year-old pictured on
the cover. His voice never quite
takes on the raw animal energy
encapsulated in songs like Tristan
from previous album Wind In The
Wires, but that is really a conse-
quence of the more poppy nature of
The Magic Position and his voice is
certainly never without presence.
Returning for a moment to the
instrumentation, what impresses
more than any particular instru-
ment is how Wolf blends live and
electronic elements, with synthe-
sizers working their way into a host
of tracks and some very interest-
ing arcade machine samples turn-
ing up on Get Lost (as well as a
theremin).
The main highlight of the record
has to be the title track, soon to be
released as a single, which exem-
plifies Wolf's new poppier direction;
with its uplifting strings, playful
handclaps and stomping feet, this
is a song you could actually dance
to! Other strong points are opening
track Overture, singalong friendly
Accident & Emergency and the
bouncy fairground anthem Get
Lost.
Wolf unsurprisingly doesn't go
wrong with the slower numbers
either, such as the quite listenable
ukelele and piano led ballad Augus-
tine, if you like that kind of thing (if
you liked his previous albums then
you probably do). Even the bizarre
noise-experiment Secret Garden
doesn't seem overly out of place
here – even though it may have
been more at home in the darker
territory of his earlier work – and it
serves as a subtle reminder of how
he has evolved musically.
When you consider that Patrick
Wolf is only 23, it's hard not to be ex-
cited about what he might have to
offer in the future, but for now this
delightful collection of pop songs
will have to do.

save how formulaic the Arcade Fire
have become. After losing members
and family through death, they dug
deep with purpose and produced
Funeral, now after that success and
adding members they have become
stable, and ultimately complacent.
Basically, when they're singing or
performing, I don't feel like they
mean it and this makes it hard for
me to take the time to absorb this
album in its entirety over time.
They must try harder.
