David Lynch is one filmmaker guar-
anteed to polarise an audience. As
a reviewer, he can be simultane-
ously a dream and a nightmare,
more confusing than even his films
at times. He is the avant-garde of
the mainstream if you forgive the
paradox and three hours of Inland
Empire is certainly enough for you
to decide which side of the fence

you lie on. Assuming Lynch doesn’t
challenge your perception of what a
fence really is.
The plot of Inland Empire goes
like this: Nikki Grace (played by
Laura Dern) is a Hollywood ac-
tress, ready to make a massive re-
turn to the top with her new film but
soon finds herself falling for her co-
star despite being married already.
As it becomes known to her that the
movie is a remake of one that was
never previously completed under
mysterious circumstances, things
begin to take a bizarre twist and
then, erm, well, yeah… After this
just go with the flow, whether it be
up, down, sideways, whatever.
If you aren’t aware of David
Lynch and his work you won’t really
appreciate how weird it gets after
that. If however you’ve seen, for ex-
ample, Mulholland Drive, you’ll ap-
preciate exactly where I’m coming
from. Lynch is a master of the sur-
real and it will depend on how much
you are willing to follow his abstrac-
tions of reality whether you can en-
joy this or not. It is not a film I would
lightly recommend to someone, but
to those who want to see something
a bit different, I’d push you to your
seat and chain you to the chair until
it’s over, just in case you considered
leaving half way through. The cou-
ple in front of me did, be warned
that it’s not for everyone.

Amazing illusions aren’t solely
confined to the likes of brilliant
magicians and conjurers. For ex-
ample, have you ever wondered
where all your alcohol disappears
to every time you walk out of your
room, even with your faithful room-
mate guarding it? Perhaps you are
still puzzling over how that pile of
work suddenly appeared on your
desk. And how in the world did that
deadline creep up on you without
you seeing it coming?
The Illusionist manages to
achieve the impossible, though, by
keeping you sitting there for two
solid hours despite comprised of
mainly two-dimensional charac-
ters and a fairly dull beginning: it
is the pleasingly convoluted and
rapid advancement of the plot that
makes this film a fairly enjoyable
experience, continually keeping
you guessing.
Set in turn-of-the-20th-Century
Austria, it begins with the arrest
of the mysterious and enigmatic
Eisenheim, charged with demon-
strating necromancy on stage. At
this point we are introduced to the
characters of the Chief Inspector of
Police and Crown Prince Leopold,
the latter of whom aggressively de-
mands the former reveal the dark
magician’s past to him; and so be-
gins a far-fetched tale of childhood
friends, lost love, an unexplained

journey and even an attempt to
overthrow the government.
You get the whole package deal
with this story, and with a small
cast compared to films of a similar
nature, you would expect the film to
be primarily character driven. The
characters, sadly, do not appear to
have much emotional depth, and
sometimes it is difficult to feel for
the situations they so inconven-
iently put themselves in; however,
as the plot is the driving force for
the entire production, by the time
the twists and turns start to slowly
reveal themselves one cannot help
but root for the two lovers.
Jessica Biel, whilst not given a
particularly generous amount of
screen time, is perfectly adequate
in the role of the great Eisenheim’s
passionate interest. Edward Nor-
ton is a good choice for the role of
the magician himself, and although
he cannot seem to force himself to
portray emotion particularly ex-
plicitly, in retrospect I believe this
to be the essence of his role as the
unassuming, straight-faced, highly
intelligent master of the dark arts.
Until the very end his emotional
output is incredibly hard to see, and
the tone of his voice simply refuses
to change, giving the audience the
distinct impression that he is al-
ways in control and never out of the
picture.
Nevertheless, it is Paul Giamat-
ti’s performance as Chief Inspector
Url, right-hand man to the ruthless
Crown Prince Leopold (played by
an ominous, convincingly menac-
ing Rufus Sewell) that steals the
show: torn apart by glory on one
side and a moral duty on the oth-
er, it is this inner conflict which
propels the plot forwards. More
significantly, it is the character to
which the audience can relate to;
he is none the wiser as to how Ei-
shenheim’s spectacular feats are
accomplished.
The pace of the plot is similar to
the plot itself, in that it begins slow-
ly and does not pick up until about
a third of the way through, after
the characters are given some
background history. Until this
point it is difficult to see what di-
rection the film is taking although
suddenly, events take a turn for the
worse and the storyline and pace
explode in the face of boredom
and the more mundane character
roles suddenly become far more
interesting.
It is safe to say that some peo-
ple will predict the ending before
it happens, but it is the journey
you take to get there which is far
more interesting. Whereas the
film refuses to reveal many of the
great magician’s tricks, it does
reveal how the greatest illusion
was accomplished, and this makes
the inevitable epilogue greatly
satisfying.
All in all, this is well worth the
ticket price simply to see Giamat-
ti’s show-stealing performance
and to try and work out just how
such an elaborate illusion seems
so plausible; a truly mesmerising
film.
Pure Magic.
Could it be magic? It certainly casts some spell
at others it seemed like cinema
nirvana. He truly understands cin-
ema in a way few directors do and
makes the audience undergo an ex-
perience rather than listen to a co-
herent story. This is his first feature
I’ve seen in the cinema and there is
no other forum for it: my senses felt
assaulted, totally overloaded in the
dark atmosphere. As the lights go
up I felt like talking to the random
people next to me about it, feeling
that we’d shared an intense experi-
ence that doesn’t come very often.
Thankfully I refrained.
Laura Dern is fantastic in the
lead role, carrying the whole film.
Best known to many as Dr Ellie
Satler in Jurassic Park, I wasn’t
expecting that much from her
given her absence from the indus-
try for so long. But woah, does she
impress. This pulls the rug from
under Helen Mirren, no joke. She
is required throughout to be so
many characters, conveying each
one brilliantly, and it’s easy to un-
derstand why Lynch chose her for
their third collaboration. Her face is
not typical Hollywood, and the fluo-
rescent lipstick she sports at points
adds character to a real human
face, not some airbrushed goddess.
I could gush for ages on this so I’ll
stop now.
The imagery is the key here.
When it feels like it’s dragging,
suddenly there’s a room of girls do-
ing the Locomotion. Or the people
in rabbit heads spouting non-se-
quiturs, one of whom is allegedly
Naomi Watts. Not to mention the
spectacular lighting throughout or
the way he uses camera focus to
further distort space. It really is a
sensual, both visual and audible,
feast right up until the last bar of
Nina Simone’s “Sinnerman” com-
pletes the credits.
So why wouldn’t people like it
then? It’s tough going if you’re not
looking for cinema as art. If you
want a story then don’t go to this
one without being warned. I found
that I had to psyche myself up in
the morning for it as it can take the
mental concentration of a Jedi not
to go mad yourself during a Lynch
film. It’s hard to remember lots of
it too because of its innate abstract-
ness, so you’re left more with an
impression that specific scenes.
As for what Lynch is trying to con-
vey with this, it could be interpreted
differently by everyone who sees it.
As far as I can see, it seems to por-
tray Hollywood as a land of confu-
sion, uncertainty and menace. Is
Lynch trying to distance himself
from Hollywood? He certainly isn’t
a typical studio director but seems
to have integrated himself into the
mainstream, possibly as a token
alternative.
That doesn’t diminish his talents
however, and Inland Empire sump-
tuously wraps up everything it
means to be a David Lynch film.
