Obligatory end of term snorefest
Robin George Andrews with another sycophantic essay on some popular act at the minute
It’s probably best to describe it as
walking into the dream of an LSD
addict. Lollipops, lots of pink-fla-
voured flamboyancy and a gigan-
tic monkey, the stage was set for
what turned out to be more of a
show than any kind of gig I’ve ever
experienced.
Mika, the Beirut-born London
based pop sensation, made famous
for his single Grace Kelly (which
ironically places the music indus-
try in a wholesomely negative light)
performed his entire album at the
infamous Koko venue in Camden.
Even at the beginning of his ca-
reer, the Freddie Mercury dead
ringer has amassed a huge fan
base, and it is fairly easy to see
why. Pop music, as it is generically
termed, is often bland, unoriginal
and seriously unimaginative. Mika
has injected a serious overdose
of happy juice into the dwindling
genre, and tonight he brought his
album to life, not to mention raising
the roof at Koko, a venue primarily
focusing on indie music.
From the opening jumper Love
Today to the more piano-led tracks
such as My Interpretation and Over
My Shoulder, he showed a surpris-
ingly impressive range in vocal
style and musical composition, and
his perpetual bouncing around the
stage, accompanied by the quite en-
joyable lyrics themselves, he suc-
cessfully made a hard-line progres-
sive rocker smile; this, I guarantee
you, is incredibly rare thing for pop
music to accomplish.
The support band were as much
a part of the act as the man of the
hour himself, with some brilliant
guitar riffs increasing the energy of
the already hyperactive songs, par-
ticularly the catchy Billy Brown,
which was accompanied by two ad-
ditional brass players, to add some
blaring instrumentality to the pro-
ceedings to great effect.
The entire performance was de-
lightfully camp but was at no point
in your face; you couldn’t help being
swept up by the motion of it all. The
songs themselves were all com-
pletely unique, and each developed
its own unique character, all thanks
to the charisma of Mika and his im-
pressive vocal range, which even
live seems physically impossible.
The man must have vocal chords
the size of a single mini-cheddar.
The only let down was the dura-
Claimed by many to be one of the
‘up and coming’ bands for this year,
a band described as playing ‘in-
cessantly catchy pop, like Blur, or
Franz at their giddy best’, well de-
cide for yourselves.
Made up of four people, Phil (vo-
cals, rhythm guitar), Beal (Bass),
Roz (drums), and co-writer and co-
founder Sulli (lead guitar) from the
Midlands! We caught up with the
band for a chat, in the Shepherd’s
Bush Empire where we find them
having a couple of drinks.
So you’re here at the empire sup-
porting the Kaiser Chiefs, How did
that come to happen? Are you en-
joying the tour?
Yeah, its great. They picked us actu-
ally, their drummer came to see us
when we played in London a while
back. The next day we were told
they wanted us to support them.
They where doing a DJ set on Zane
Lowe’s show a couple of weeks ago,
and they played our single (LOCK
UP YOUR DAUGHTERS) as the 1st
track.
Have many other bands been sup-
port alongside you?
The 1990’s, there’s two bills rotating
between each night, us and them
are on the same night. Really nice
guys.
How far through the tour are you
now? Is there any night in particu-
lar you enjoyed playing?
This is the 5th night now and we
have another two to do. All the
night have been good, but Man-
chester, the 1st date was the best
cause it the 1st massive gig we’ve
ever done, The adrenaline alone
made it the best.
Do you find may people know who
you are?
Not really on this tour, it sold out so
fast everyone is a hard core Kaiser
Chief fan! But we supported the Pi-
geon Detectives earlier in the year,
and loads of people knew our single
then. But those gigs attract the kin-
da ‘new music’ fans.
So you’ve had one single out with
your current record (1965) did you
try to release anything yourselves
first?
Not really no, we did a couple of
small demos and stuff but everyone
does that. Nothing major, even this
single was only on limited release,
it was just to get the name out there
really. We were lucky cause it was
put on a NME CD and a rough trade
cd, that helped a lot. It get quite a
good reaction when we play it now.
You got an album in the works?
The albums finished, we’ve just
got to mix it now. I always thought
that when u record an album, u just
record it in and there, its done. But
there’s loads to do to it to get the
sounds right after. Ian Broudie from
the Lightning Seeds is producing it
with us, he’s done The Coral and
the subways already so.
Good fun to work with?
Yeah, great, the nicest guy you could
meet kinda thing. Yesterday we had
a day off so we just went round to
his house and chilled out a bit. Wan-
dered around Portobello road mar-
ket and watched a bit of Harry Hill.
He’s really good with new bands,
only really does first album, apart
from The Coral. He just eases you
into it, very keen to keep the ‘live
sound’ on the album. You got your
deal through what you sound like at
the start so you should need to piss
around with the 1st album.
So when can we expect the
album?
There’s a single out at the end of
April I think, our first full release,
called My Precious Valentine then
the album should be out at the end
of the summer.
Did you all help write the album?
Phil (Wallbank, lead vocals and
rhythm guitar) writes most of the
stuff on an acoustic guitar, then he
brings it to us and we each add in
our parts ourselves. Every one is
pretty in tune with how the song
should go, no ones trying to take
crazy bass solo’s where they don’t
fit or anything.
Does the album have a name?
No, not yet. We’ve been thinking
about a few but you tend to just
think about in jokes that we find
hilarious but no one else would get.
If you think about it most album
names are crap until the album re-
ally get known. Like Modern Life by
Blur, what a terrible name! But be-
cause it becomes known as a good
album and the name is associated
with it, its ok. As long as we don’t
call it Ripchord it’ll b fine.
So you where signed by James
(Endeacottt (1965 records)) in
what, august?
Nah, May, just before the A-levels.
Some of us had exams and the oth-
er’s went travelling. So we didn’t
get anything going for a while, but
that partly because we weren’t good
enough really, needed more prac-
tice. We did the 1st few album tack
at the end of august then had a gap
where we did nothing but practice.
So its been a pretty interesting
year for you all then?
Yeah, I mean it doesn’t seem like it
cause we’ve been doing it an we’re
about to play Shepherd’s Bush, but
if you’d said that to us a year ago it
would have been mad. IT doesn’t
seem weird at all though.
Are you playing any festivals over
the summer?
Yeah hopefully, We’d love to play
Glastonbury, Reading, Leeds, but I
think they only sort out the smaller
bands later on, we just want to go 2
Glastonbury really.
Have you all registered just in
case?
Erm, when’s the last day you can?
Tomorrow, are you going to any
others? Oxygen has an interesting
line up.
Not sure, not a big fan of the Chillis
and there was a rumour they would
play.
At this point the band descend into
a rant about which bands they re-
ally don’t like, too loud for us to
catch everything, except that they
are not big fans, to say the least
of both the Red Hot Chilli Peppers
and Bloc Party. Coming back to the
interview:
So a year from now, what would
you like Ripchord to be doing?
We’d really like a song in the charts,
as you go on your aims get bigger.
A year ago we just wanted to re-
lease a single. Now we’ve done that
we want to be in the top 40, an in a
years time maybe a headline tour
with fans going nuts to the songs.
I think when you hear one of your
songs played in the background of a
soap like ‘eastender’s’ you’ve really
made it.
Finally the band leave to do their
sound check and we consider how
not to get ejected from the back-
stage area without passes. Rip-
chord are genuinely one of the
friendliest bands I’ve met and their
songs aren’t exactly shabby. Keep
an eye out for that single at the end
of April.

Interview with up-and-coming Ripchord
Mika
Koko
live review tion of the performance, which was
sadly, approximately, only one hour.
Nevertheless, with only one album
out and literally at the start of his
career in the eyes of the public, he
can be excused; his excellent per-
formance, which stands out from
any other pop act around the UK
today, more than makes up for it.
Whatever child-like inhibitions
that were being held in by the au-
dience were unleashed during the
animated conclusion to the set, Lol-
lipop, which saw the release of such
a vast quantity of vitreous confetti
it could have filled the entire Royal
Albert Hall. Everyone was either
leaping into the sky to intercept as
much of it as possible as if the Crys-
tal Maze had returned, or stood
there and slowly became immersed
in it. By the time Mika walked off
the stage, hundreds of people were
assaulting each other with masses
of the glittery confetti, with some
being uncomfortably placed inside
some unfortunate places.
I remain impressed by this sig-
nificant entry into the UK music
scene even after the glittery, ec-
stasy-mimicking performance had
faded into memories. Still, despite
my tiredness and complete and ut-
ter disorientation I seem to have
experienced tonight, I could walk to
Koko from here: I just have to fol-
low the confetti trail leading from
Camden to South Kensington. That
stuff’s like gold dust to the most im-
mature of minds.
