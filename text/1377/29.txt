A
large crowd gathered
at Richmond Stadium
to watch the 5th An-
nual JPR Williams Cup
match, a game that is
fiercely contested every year and
this year was no exception, with
some ferocious tackles, fast pace
running and a bitter rivalry run-
ning through both teams.
The game started and within a
few minutes, Imperial gave away a
penalty within kicking distance of
the posts, which the medics quickly
punished them for by getting the
three points. However, this did not
dampen Imperial’s spirits and they
quickly bounced back with some
great attacking lines and often
breaking through the medics defen-
sive line, before a last ditch tackle
stopped the attack. This pressure
continued from the forwards and
the backs, with some fierce tack-
les coming from both sides, but
the poor pitch conditions hindered
any aggressive forward play whilst
the backs had better fortune with
Nathan Alliston and James Alford
persistently breaking the line. Fi-
nally Jo Brown found a gap in the
defence and scored a try under the
posts for Imperial, giving them a
the lead at 7 - 3.
With the Medics going behind,
the pressure from their large pack
increased, however the Impe-
rial forwards were not ready to let
them simply walk to the line and
defended with all their might. How-
ever, with the first half drawing to
a close, the Medics finally got the
try from a rolling maul off a lineout,
which the forwards were unable to
stop leaving the score at half time
10 – 7 to the medics.
The second half saw much of the
same from both teams; attrition in
the forwards and superb attack-
ing lines from the backs, carefully
targeting the Medics weakness on
the wings. Unfortunately, all of this
pressure could not be converted
into any points, due to some great
tackling and some foul play in rucks
and mauls by the Medics. A try did
come, however it was the Medic
pack that managed to get it from a
very dangerous scrum just off the
Imperial try line towards the end
of the game, where the Imperial
front row collapsed and the referee
allowed play to continue over them
as they walked over the try line.
With the game drawing to a close,
the pressure increased even fur-
ther from Imperial until finally the
Medics foul play caught up with
them as their scrum-half was sin-
binned, giving Imperial a 5 minute
window to mount a strong attack.
However it was not to be and the
final score stayed at 17 – 7 to the
Medics, giving them there fifth win
of this competition.
This year saw yet again a hard
contested game, with the Medics
just edging to victory towards the
end of the game, something JPR
was more than happy to point it
out. However every year the com-
petition does grow from strength to
strength and the teams always pro-
vide an exciting game for everyone
to watch.
Finally a great thank you has to
go to the players that are leaving
next year, especially to the captain
Michael Hicks, who throughout his
6 years at Imperial has given every-
thing he has to he club, but his body
on the more line on more than one
occasion, and will be sorely missed
when he graduates. Thank you guys
and good luck.
