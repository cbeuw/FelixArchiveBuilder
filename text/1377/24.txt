Comment: Long live the Desktop!
With Windows Vista comes an-
other piece of “revolutionary”
technology from those friendly
blokes in Redwood. This time,
they’re going to integrate Xbox
Live with Vista, allowing PC gam-
ers to play all sorts of games with
our console brethren. It’s a fairly
good idea, if it weren’t for one fac-
tor: consoles suck (see above).
The Good
There are a handful of games that
PC gamers might want to play from
the Xbox 360. Burnout comes to
mind, as does Splinter Cell. Gears
of War and Halo 2 would be a good
laugh, if only to once and for all
prove the superiority of keyboard
and mouse over gamepad. The
service brings little else to the fray,
as PC gamers are largely unwilling
to settle for less and use Microsoft’s
services – a point already proven
by the long-dead Microsoft Gaming
Zone.
The Bad
Console games are limited by slow
controls, which means shooters are
out. This leaves racing, fighting and
RPGs. Console RPGs tend to be
single-player, so they’re out. Racing
games, well, the PC has something
for everyone. Burnout seems like a
few laughs, but with excellent simu-
lations like GT Legends, why settle
for less? Even if you’re after explo-
sions, you’ve still got Flatout on the
PC. And fighting games have been
popular on the PC, well, never.
And all this without mentioning
that Xbox Live costs money – cold,
hard cash – to use what is basically
a tiny subset of the Internet. And
who’d want to pay to play simplified
games against people who haven’t
yet realised that their consoles need
to be dusted off with a baseball bat?
Footnote – Live! on the PC? Over my Dead! body
The PC has seen worse wars than this, says Sebastian Nordgren, and it’ll get the last laugh now too
T
his is a rant. I’m telling
you this so that you don’t
read the first half and
start fuming at the un-
mitigated crap I will no
doubt be spewing by then. Why am
I ranting? Because consoles suck.
I could care less if Merrill-Lynch
(thanks for the free food!) predicts
that 1 in 3 US households will own
a Wii by 2010. It’s still a useful sta-
tistic though, since that means that
1 in 3 households contain at least
one bell end. Probably more, if you
count the Xbox 360 – It’s So Revo-
lutionary, It’s Going In The Same
Direction! – and the PS3.
Why do I hate consoles? I mean,
I did have those amazing gaming
experiences at the age of 8 on my
brand-spanking-new NES, and ex-
perienced the indescribably fantas-
tic Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time
on the Nintendo 64. However, I di-
gress. Consoles suck because they
cannot in any way, shape or form
drive the design of games forward.
The truly revolutionary games of
recent years (Darwinia, Defcon, N,
Morrowind, etc.) were not designed
for consoles. Consoles, all of them,
are adept at sucking the complexity
out of any game.
Compare the fantastic Deus Ex to
its successor Invisible War – instead
of the subtle UI, complex inventory
management and slow, meaningful
bionics upgrade choices, we get a
massive HUD with a crosshair the
size of a basketball, a leveling and
upgrade system that gives you eve-
rything you wanted in the first 3
hours and one type of ammo. One
type of ammo. For rocket launch-
ers and shotguns and dart guns!
It’s not an isolated incident by any
measure, and as more and more
developers aim for multi-platform
launches, the people suffering are
not just PC gamers, but gamers in
general.
The excellent Baldur’s Gate se-
ries was turned into a repetitive
hack’n’slash in Dark Alliance, Halo
was bought by Microsoft and turned
into a slow-paced shooter where
enemies stand still for up to half a
minute, just waiting for you to shoot
them. It’s a terrible trend, and the
peak of console gaming is still far,
far less original than PC classics of
over 5-6 years ago. No One Lives
Forever, Battlefield 1942, and Half-
Life redefined shooters on the PC,
only to have Bungie sell more units
than any of them because they
made a game with all the depth of a
puddle on an average London day.
The things that differentiate con-
sole games from their PC coun-
terparts are not clever design
decisions to challenge the player,
they’re simplifications to cope with
a shite control system and a screen
resolution less than half of what
PC gamers have been running for
years. Even 1080p, a standard that
is well out of the reach of most con-
solers, has already been surpassed
on the PC. Games like Grand Theft
Auto and Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater,
which sold silly amounts on every
console, flopped on the PC – not
because the game itself was worse
– but because PC gamers expect
more. More variety, more depth,
more complexity, more customiz-
ability – just more.
In fact, I’m willing to go so far to
say that consoles are nothing but
a glorified home arcade machine.
The games that sell so much on
consoles are graphically updated
arcade classics. Metal Slug, Street
Fighter, Gran Turismo, Dance
Dance Revolution – these are all
games that used to be played at
local arcades in some very similar
rendition. A console is little more
than a way to pay a one-off £300
instead of 20p every 10 minutes to
play those fun, yet ultimately point-
less, games in the comfort of your
own homes.
With all this talk of the “console
wars”, there really does seem to
be only one solution – force every-
one onto the PC. Every console is
devolving into an underpowered
PC anyway, with boot menus, oper-
ating systems and internet brows-
ing coming built-in, so I fail to see
where the shoe pinches. Abandon
your artificial constraints and con-
trived design decisions and join the
true gaming revolution – the PC.
