IC retain hockey cup
After much deliberation over the
events of the annual showdown
with our arch nemesis, more com-
monly known as the IC medics the
following recollection of events was
pieced together:
Having seen the ladies 2s and
mens 2s draw and win respectively,
it was the turn of the ladies 1s to
continue to momentum in favour
of IC. Having met the medics once
before this season, and successfully
retained the ULU cup for the second
time the previous Sunday, IC were
going into the match confident.
However, this was not to be dem-
onstrated from the offset, with IC
giving balls away cheaply, not clos-
ing down players, nor moving to-
wards the ball. It was only when the
medics drew first blood, yet again
denying the team their first clean
sheet of the season, that IC girls
woke up and started playing the
hockey they are capable of:
We came straight back with a
stonking solo effort from our be-
loved captain, Moony. Once in our
stride everything started to go ac-
cording to the books, and we were
looking comfortable at half time.
However it is not IC’s style to do
things the easy way, and in a hor-
rible case of déjà vu the medics
scored a few goals bringing them
only one goal behind IC. It did also
seem that the umpire was doing his
up most to upset IC’s rhythm; sin
binning Clayton, telling our crowd
to quieten down, and generally mak-
ing decisions in the medics favour.
(Someone has to like them!- Ed)
IC did their up most to hold on to
their slender lead, when they should
have perhaps carried on playing
more attacking hockey. And in due
course, with 5 minutes to go, IC
were punished, with Spanner find-
ing herself in a one on one situation.
Cleanly taking the ball and admit-
tedly a bit of the player, the umpire
deemed it dangerous play and she
was duly sin binned and the medics
awarded a penalty flick! (The inci-
dent has, less kindly, been called
the dirtiest two-footed challenge
outside of a football pitch-Ed).
At 5-4, this meant that medics had
a high chance of equalising.
Howard, more commonly known
for crunching defenders outfield,
decided to take on the responsibil-
ity of donning the goalie’s kit and
stepped up to the challenge, receiv-
ing a few hasty coaching tips from a
rather tipsy ladies 2’s keeper.
There was an eerie silence whilst
the flick was being taken, despite
Howard diving the right way, there
was just enough power to get the
ball in the back of the net.
Only minutes remained of the
match, all square at 5-5, both IC’s
pride and reputation were at stake.
From the push-back, IC attacked
and found themselves in the oppo-
nents D once again, with grit, deter-
mination, a never say die attitude,
and much scrapping IC eventually
scored!
The final whistle shortly followed
with the team celebrating a victory
that ensured IC retained the hock-
ey, varsity cup aswell as the ULU
cup victory at the weekend.
