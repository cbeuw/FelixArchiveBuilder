Varsity 2007 was the third year that
Men’s Football has been included in
the Varsity event. After two years
of misery for the Medic’s they must
have come into this year’s event
confident of victory after the IC
Medic’s 1st and 2nd XI’s having
such a good year over the IC Hunk
XI.
IC 3rd’s played IC Medic 1st’s in
the second fixture of this academ-
ic year. After a tense first half the
goals started flowing and IC 3rd’s
found themselves 2-1 up late in sec-
ond-half injury time. This was the
moment in which this years Medics
made their mark in Medic football
history by amazingly equalising
and therefore avoiding defeat to a
“stunningly good looking” IC 3rd
XI.
From there the Medic’s year got
even better as in both IC Medic
2nd’s vs. IC 3rd’s ‘The Hunks’ fix-
tures the Medics pulled off the feat
of only losing by one goal on both
occasions after getting dominated,
and some would say toyed with by a
rampant Imperial side. In fact they
could in future be labelled perhaps
the best Medic 2nd XI of all time by
managing to score a goal against
Imperial opposition. Only time will
tell.
Our esteemed 1st XI captain Pat
‘We Won the ULU Cup’ Beef then
rightly decided that instead of play-
ing the Medic 1st XI with 5 men and
himself being blindfolded he would
let the IC 2nd and 3rd XI’s take over
and deliver the expected trouncing.
The IC 3rd XI lined up against
the Medic 2nd XI, briefly laughed
then went out in the first half and
delivered a football master class.
Possession was easily maintained
throughout the team and shots
rained down on the Medic goal. Af-
ter hitting the crossbar and the post
in quick succession Scott Greening
delivered a wonderful corner where
a Sam Rickards flick only narrowly
missed the target. Up front Matt
Gready pushed around Medic de-
fenders at will and was unlucky
not to be awarded a penalty due
to a lazy challenge by the Medic
centre-back. The highlight of the
Success at BUSA Cross Country Championships
James Blyth
match then came when the Medic
midfield put together four passes in
succession, which was alluded to by
the Medic captain later in the sec-
ond half when he asked his team to
“play like they did in the first-half.”
The second half was a lower key
affair with passing becoming diffi-
cult on a pitch that became increas-
ingly cut-up. Chances were limited
to long range efforts, although an
IC 3rd shot was cleared off the
line late on by some decent Medic
defending.
By the final whistle a few of
the Imperial boys could stand no
longer, which was not due to physi-
cal exhaustion but fits of laughter.
An innocent remark by the Medic
Captain where he asked his boys
to “run, run you heart out, run like
you’ve never run before,” was im-
maculately timed a provided a lift
to a slightly dejected 3rd XI who
felt dissatisfied at wasting so many
first-half chances. A point apiece
left the IC 2nd XI needing only a
draw to reclaim the Football Varsity
Cup for the third year in a row.
The 2nd XI vs. Medic 1st XI was
a high quality affair. The 2nd XI
defence this year has been phe-
nomenal and with the leadership
of Richy Parasram and the experi-
ence of former captains AK, Dave
Jai and Vanni Mariggi the club was
more than confident that our 2nd
XI could get a result over the Medic
1st XI.
Obviously the Medics didn’t lie
down and they put in some heavy
tackles. But in the end their cause
was not aided by having a ginger
haired midfielder and they were
easily beaten by goals from Jack
Britton and Deji Akiboye. Deji,
himself a Medic, had decided ear-
lier in the year to play IC football
instead as “playing for the Med-
ics would harm his footballing CV
irreparably.” A choice well made
and a fantastic result for the 2nd
XI saw the Football Varsity Cup re-
tained and the footballers went on
to Richmond and sang their hearts
out for our much loved egg-chasing
friends.
The weekend started well when
we survived the attempted murder
by the University of London, who
managed to hire a coach driver who
thought it sensible to reverse down
a motorway against oncoming traf-
fic; a coach driver who also half way
through the journey asked if any-
one had brought a map with them.
Despite this incompetence we final-
ly arrived at our luxury hotel in the
middle of nowhere.
The first race of the day was the
11.9km mens race which also incor-
porated the World Cross Champs
trials. Imperial was led in by an out-
standing manner by Wynne Evans,
finished 82nd overall.
Shortly after came Miguel Bran-
co, in 109th with a solid perform-
ance in his last BUSA XC. 127th
place was Ed Pitt Ford in a formida-
ble demonstation of front running
for the first lap (of many), with the
people’s champ Chris Mullington
not far behind in 162nd. 10 places
back was Sven wearing spikes that
caused foot sized blisters, a real
team player.
Last home for the team was Allan
who stopped on route a couple of
times for an ice-cream break – ap-
parently the cornettos were pretty
good.
Unlike the University of London
all our runners managed to com-
plete the race. Imperial came 21st
out of the Great British Universi-
ties an excellent effort for our debut
performance, and something that
can be built on in future years.
The second race was the Womens
race of about 6.7344567621km, again
incorporating the World Champion-
ship trials. The first Imperial run-
ner, Harriet Scott, finished 8th in an
incredibly strong field, an awesome
achievement and the most out-
standing performance of the day.
Second home was Angharad Care,
with a gutsy run to finish just out
of the top 100 despite little training.
Making up the rest of the team was
women’s captain Harriet Kirk, with
Lucia and Sabine on their debuts
for Imperial and Emily who ran
strongly, exceeding her own expec-
tations. No doubt the best female
XC team Imperial has ever had.
The final race of the day was the
8km Mens B race. The lead runner
from Imperial being club captain
Leo Murray. A few places behind
was first year Dave Blundell, surely
a name for the future. Not long after
came Christophe, and club star Rob
Done, better known for bar exploits
than actual running. Making up the
rest of the team were Beit Boy Tim,
Wes ‘that was just my warmup’ Br-
iscoe, Aaron Mason and the legen-
dary Tarik, making an all too rare
appearance. The team came home
in 19th.
The weekend was topped off by
a party hosted by Bath University
who very kindly let theiving scum-
bags ULU use their photocopier to
‘purchase’ extra tickets.
Many thanks to Accenture, Sport
Imperial and Tutorlink (www.tutor-
link.org.uk), who made this week-
end possible.
