GDC 2007 – The Desktop is dead...
The dust settles after this year’s GDC, but who’s taken the bullets? Michael Cook checks the fallen
W
ith a notable ab-
sence of half-na-
ked women pro-
moting games,
and writers from
every fansite on the internet, the
Games Developer Conference 2007
was reduced to the main compo-
nents of every great media confer-
ence – wild speculation, unbounded
criticism, and cries of doomsday.
Maybe it was the absence of E3,
maybe it was the presence of the
PS3, whatever it was has made the
GDC’s latest event a high-stakes
event, with a lot of fresh announce-
ments coming through followed by
the inevitable slew of criticism and
internet “debate”.
One moment Nintendo were sti-
fling all online development, the
next they announce their first on-
line-enabled title will be out before
Winter of this year.
First we get news that a Spore de-
veloper thinks the Wii is “a piece of
shit” and suddenly he’s playing the
Devil’s Advocate card to an internet
full of angry, oversugared gamers.
I don’t know what it is, but it’s
beginning to scare me. The whole
damn industry is beginning to
scare me. Nokia will be releasing a
third incarnation of its NGage, and
Microsoft’s Zune – an mp3 player
even less suited to gaming than the
iPod – will potentially be gaming-
capable in its next incarnation.
And, of course, the big news of
the conference – the Playstation3’s
Home technology, allowing users to
interact with each other in a virtual
world, with a virtual house, virtual
clothes and presumably a virtual
Playstation3. It’s like Second Life,
but without some people dressed
as cats.
Well, presumably. No-one actually
posed that one to Phil Harrison af-
ter the announcement.
But – and I know, I know this sto-
ry comes up every year – the most
troubling undertones in the confer-
ence came from a relatively low-key
panel discussion on the future of
PC Gaming.
Everyone’s always spelling the
demise of the big grey box, and it
still remains strong today, but the
panel – composed of developers
Firaxis, Epic, XBox LIVE and oth-
ers – instead suggested that PC
gaming may fade into obscurity,
rather than be bullied out of the
commercial ring.
“PC gaming is in a state of transi-
tion,” explained EA’s Richard Hil-
leman, who went on to say that PC
gaming was being developed for
“niche” gaming.
He would know – the top five PC
games of the moment are all from
the Sims franchise, and two of the
remain- ing five are also EA ti-
tles. But he wasn’t
stupid – PC gam-
ing hadn’t de-
volved into the
casual mire
thatPRwas
Michael Capps, who said it “killed”
Epic to have to make Unreal 3
multiplatform, but that PC gaming
was simply “falling apart”. What’s
changed?
iD seem quite confident of what’s
changed – their CEO, Todd Hel-
lenshead, gave a lecture on soft-
ware piracy at the GDC, explaining
that it was this that pushed iD into
multiplatform development. Epic
and iD, originally two of the PC’s
premier developmers, forced onto
consoles because of rising develop-
ment costs.
And the kicker, as Capps pointed
out at the panel – “Shooters are
doing well on consoles now.
Nobody thought that
would happen.”
But to place the
blame on BitTor-
renters alone
would be a lit-
tle foolish. The
simple fact is
that PC Gam-
ing doesn’t know
what its doing.
It’s the gam-
ing equivalent of a
Communist state –
and a poorly governed
one at that.
If someone wants to make
a first-person shooter, they
make one and it gets published.
There’s no quality control, no
hive mind, no organisation –
unlike consoles, with the
top-down organisation
offered by the likes
of Nintendo, Micro-
soft, and Sony.
Games For Win-
dows attempted to
group PC Games
together, but Mi-
crosoft are unable to
claim the platform as
their own in any
meaningful way,
and even if they
did it may be too
late, with the plat-
form in such dis-
array and the media
so split on what the PC
even means.
“The thing we really needed [in Fable] ... is love” Molyneux explains. Cheers, Pete – but does anyone care?
“I’m the most nervous I’ve ever
been in my career,” Lionhead’s Pe-
ter Molyneux told gaming website
Kotaku last week. “I’ll show [the
journalists] this feature and they
won’t get it. They’ll turn around
and say, ‘OK, what about the big
weapons?’”
Whereas publications like PC
Gamer, websites like The Escap-
ist, and new-games-journalists like
Kieron Gillen or Jim Rossignol all
attempt to evangelise the fringes
of PC gaming and the “limits” that
are being pushed by the more auda-
cious developers, the public seem
less sure, and are wary of getting
too close to their humming grey
cuboid. Magazines such as Edge
give it an ivory tower aftertaste,
and make the simplicity of consoles
a more comfortable prospect.
And on the other hand, you’ve got
Molyneux’s dilemma, dealing with
the rest of the media who only want
to see the big, the loud, and the
impressive.
Back to the panel, they discuss
DEFCON and the steps it took to
change the strategy genre. Did it
succeed because it went art-like
and shook things up?
“The great thing about DEFCON
was its shape,” said Firaxis’ Soren
Johnson. “It’s important for peo-
ple to start making medium-sized
games on the PC, because the PC
can do that. It’s that flexible.”
Of course, it’s possible that the
death of the PC would be a ben-
eficial step for gaming, moving the
focus to sharply-designed, well-im-
plemented hardware and a better
sense of gaming community.
But looking back on the last dec-
ade of innovation in games design,
one thing seems worryingly evident
– most things began on the PC.
It turns out that the PC’s sav-
iour will also be its biggest money
churner – MMOs. They can’t be
pirated, they can’t be sold on and
– currently, at least – they’re ex-
tremely poorly implemented on
consoles.
But it feels like a last defence, a
falling back to the online redoubt,
now being advanced on by LIVE,
Home, and a battalion of Miis.
A software pirate. A-haha. It was funny when they used it in the adverts and it’s funny now. Shut up
claiming it had. What the media call
casual gamers are actually playing
in excess of twenty hours a week.
What saddened me the most was
the opinion of Epic’s
