Mexican standoff – Ghost Recon 2
Something bad’s going on south of the border. For a job like this, you need a man like Robin Andrews
W
elcome back
to Mexico: the
Ghosts are back
for some unfin-
ished business,
and this time things have taken a
turn for the worse. One year after
the coup d’état in Mexico City, the
rebel uprising has spread to most
of Latin America, and support from
overseas nations means conflict
between loyalist Mexican soldiers
and the insurrectionists erupts
once again; the difference this time
is that it is no longer isolated to the
capital city. Most of the long-antici-
pated sequel takes place in Juarez,
a city along the Mexico-US bor-
der, and as a result the fighting is
brought a lot closer to home.
The player once again takes up
the mantle of Captain Mitchell as
the infamous Ghost squad’s team
leader. Using near-future technol-
ogy and high-tech weaponry your
mission is to stop the insurgency.
Although this sounds an awful lot
like a marketing line, it is for once
the most truthful way of describing
this game: you do indeed have re-
alistic-yet-advanced technology to
assist you, and you are able to com-
mand a series of squad members,
as well as numerous tanks, gun-
ships, and, for the first time, bomb-
ers. The story, whilst being slightly
less developed than that of the pre-
quel, keeps the game flowing at a
rapid pace and gives the player an
excuse to be thrust into several life-
or-death situations.
Despite the fact that there are
many squad-based tactical shoot-
ers out there, the first instalment
in the Advanced Warfighter series
managed to make a mark: fluid
controls, the clever Cross-Com (al-
lowing you to see through the eyes
of your commanders, squad mem-
bers, or allied vehicles), and varied,
intense, and consistently thrilling
action led to huge sales and two
BAFTA Awards. And although the
gameplay and presentation is the
same recipe, there are several as-
pects of this game that mean this is
more than just an update.
The Cross-Com itself has been
updated; not only can you still see
through the eyes of your allies
through your left eye and view news
reports and mission data through
your right, but you are now able to
enlarge the screen. From here you
can order your allies from their per-
spective, and not just yours, essen-
tially allowing you greater strategic
options when attacking the enemy.
The gameplay never lets up its
dramatic, heart-pounding momen-
tum, and the incredible variety of
mission objectives ensures you
never stop shaking from the sheer
volume of adrenaline being pumped
into your blood. Right from the very
beginning the battle sequences are
both intense and frequent, and with
a greater variety of vehicular-re-
lated sections, you always feel as
if you are part of a citywide battle,
rather than a series of fire-fights.
At the beginning of one mission,
you are tasked with extracting a
journalist, given two squads
to command, and as usual
a choice of weapons and
squad members, rang-
ing from sniper rifles
and shotguns to
C4 det-packs.
Throughout the mission you are
given air-support for the armoured
foes, countersniping equipment,
and several anti-air batteries to
take out. After a particularly diffi-
cult mission, the sight of your ex-
traction is an immensely pleasing
one; what’s even more draining is a
visceral twist like an exfiltration be-
ing ambushed by the insurgents.
Apart from the brilliant squad-
based sections and the use of satis-
fying weaponry at your disposal, the
vehicles are a welcome return to
the series. The hostiles are equal-
ly impressive – every time you’re
pinned down by a tank or gunship
you can’t help but fear what will
happen if you peek your over the
wreckage. Arguably, the introduc-
tion of airstrikes is the best game-
play addition: near the beginning
of the game you’re ambushed in a
market area, and are forced to fend
off waves of troops and tanks with-
out any support; the instant you are
able to designate targets, however,
it’s impossible not to watch in awe
as a blur appears on your screen,
followed by a river of fire.
Difficulty-wise, it’s roughly equal
to its bigger brother, but this time
around it gets difficult far quicker,
so newcomers to the tactical-shoot-
er franchise will need to learn fast.
The graphical wonder has been
amplified this time around, and
although it doesn’t provide
the same impact it did in 2006 it still
stands out amongst the next-gen
games that exist today. The detailed
cityscapes, the immaculate charac-
ters, the heat haze on the horizon,
and, of course, the truly spectacular
explosions really help to immerse.
The third-person perspective is
perfect for this type of game; with
bullets literally millimetres away
from your head, the screen shaking
as hostile armour moves towards
your position, and the panoramic
view only achievable through this
viewpoint gives the eerie feeling of
being reported on during combat
situations. Watching vehicles storm
ahead of you and your squad mem-
bers do their best to keep the enemy
pinned-down all adds up to a very
authentic and realistic experience.
Nevertheless, the graphical
splendour would be nowhere with-
out the audio, and without a doubt
this is the best sounding game I
have ever played, and where it im-
proves on the original. The familiar
but overwhelming sound effects,
ranging from the ubiquitous, boom-
ing explosions to the intricate clink-
ing of your armour are still present,
but the score has now evolved into
something to rival Hollywood. At
times the music is minimal, and
consists of a simple drone or pulse
in order to build up the tension;
when suddenly thrown into the ac-
tion the drums burst into life and
a fantastic mixture of strings and
wind instruments erupt. Perhaps
the highlight of the score occurs
during the most tragic
sections of the
game; the lone rescue missions and
daring last chances.
Once again, the duck-and-cover
mechanic returns to dominate the
sequel: gung-ho players are dead
ones, and on the rewarding but
tense Hard setting, it is essentially
a one-shot kill environment, making
manic charges towards the enemy
impossible; however, this doesn’t
mean you’ll be retreating. Several
events in the game require the
Ghosts to sprint across large, open
plains or down long, undefended
streets in order to escape swarms
of snipers, vehicles or mortar fire,
and diving behind that well-earned
cover is always followed by a sharp
intake of air.
The entire single-player cam-
paign can be completed on normal
difficulty in no more than ten hours,
and by the time you reach the cin-
ematic epilogue you’ll be asking for
more. Fortunately, the game also
excels in its multiplayer: the inclu-
sion of clans and many more maps
than on the prequel bolsters the
longevity of this game from weeks
into months. The various modes on
offer include team deathmatches,
objective-based missions, elimina-
tion and territory-based matches,
and are all excellent fun to play,
particularly when all 16 players
are present. Sadly, there is still no
cooperative mode for the single-
player campaign, which is signifi-
cantly better than the cooperative
campaign provided; however, this
additional campaign is still fun to
play. Oddly, the ability to take cover
fluidly, an aspect so core to the cam-
paign mode, is still absent here.
All in all this is not only an im-
provement over the original, but
a surprisingly significant one and
fans of the tactical shooter genre
should once again take up arms
and head down to Mexico – or bet-
ter yet, walk down to Game and buy
a copy of the second instalment
in the deservedly award-winning
GRAW series.
Oh, we know. We could make the Italian Job gag. We’re fully aware of it, but it’s too obvious. Too nineties. So, in its place – boooooooooner
Another successful “co-op” mission
