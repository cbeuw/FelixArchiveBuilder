Perceptions of science
“If our scientists and society can
hand-in-hand nurture science,
addressing as a priority the chal-
lenges and controversial moral,
ethical and social issues, then the
vision of science can undergo a
transformation.”

“The story itself is unprecedented
in its topic: our Sun is reaching the
end of its life, and a scientific ex-

Solar System in order to deliver a
payload that will – theoretically
– reignite the star.”

Beit redevelopment
plans to be changed
At a lengthy Council meeting on
Wednesday night, the paper re-
ported on in last week’s Felix was
passed, meaning the plans for
the Beit redevelopment will be
changed.
The original redevelopment plans
for the building called for the sabb
offices to be moved from the first
floor up to the fourth floor, leaving
the space free for use as a coffee
bar and lounge area.
This, however, has met with dis-
approval from the Union’s clubs
and societies, who feel that there
is more than enough space already
provided for coffee bars within the
campus already.
The paper proposed moving the
sabb offices to be adjacent to the
newly created Student Activities
Centre in the new mezzanine level
of the gym, creating a “one stop
shop” for students. The first floor
space would then be converted into
a 22m x 9m “dance studio”, com-
plete with mirrored walls and a
sprung floor.
The paper had already attracted
a large number of signatories,
similar to the environmental policy.
However, Council took issue with
calling the space a “dance studio”,
arguing that there were not enough
members of dance-related clubs for
it to be exclusive to them.
This was amended to calling the
area a “flexible club space” that all
RCSU Science
Challenge awards
clubs can use. The Union has suf-
fered a shortage of space available
for the 200+ clubs and societies to
use, and this should go some way to
allievating the pressue on the book-
ing system.
The Union is due to meet with
architects, who should prepare the
plans for the new area.
Environmental policy passed at Council
The most controversial of all the
measures in the policy is the re-
duction of the Union’s dependence
on air travel. Tours are an integral
part of many clubs, and the vast
majority of the destinations are
in Europe, which are reached by
budget airlines.
These flights have in the past
been subsidised by the Union to re-
duce the burden on clubs. The new
policy is that clubs will no longer
be subsided to areas within “Zone
1” (defined as around reachable
within 6 hours using train services)
and will be subsidised only 16% for
areas within “Zone 2” (within 12
hours of train travel).
Mark Flower, RCC Chair, raised
concerns over train operators re-
fusing to carry large and bulky
equipment (using canoes as an
example). Adele Peel, the policy’s
main proposer, accepted an amend-
ment that would allow the Clubs &
Societies Board to review each tour
on a case-by-case basis in order to
exempt them under exceptional
circumstances; for example, if the
destination is unreachable except
by air travel.
Clubs will be subsidised the cost of
a train journey, the aim being to re-
duce the Union’s carbon emissions
resulting from use of air travel. Ms
Peel pointed out that, although this
may inconvenience clubs, a change
in attitude is necessary in order to
successfully combat carbon contri-
butions leading to global warming.

The winners of the Science Chal-
lenge were announced on Friday
at the Ritz. The party, put on by the
RCSU, sold out in record time, and
many unfortunate folks could be
seen on the Facebook event page
begging for tickets to no avail.
The Challenge was to write an es-
say predicting the most important
technology of the next 100 years;
the overall winner was Naaman
Tammuz, with his essay about fu-
ture brain-computer interfaces.
The competition was also open
to local schools. The winner of the
school category was Mark Nichol-
son, who discussed the impact of
quantum computing on society.
Present at the ceremony were
Raj Persaud, psychiatrist presenter
of Radio 4’s All In The Mind, along-
side the other celebrity judges (in-
cluding Simon Singh, author of The
Code Book).
The RCSU’s official mascot, the
1916 fire engine known as “Jezebel”
was also present for ferrying the
great and good to the Ritz.
Mr Tammuz took home £2500, a
new Apple MacBook, and won a day
shadowing Dr Roger Highfield, sci-
ence editor of the Daily Telegraph.
