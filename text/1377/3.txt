The Rector, Sir Richard Sykes, has
kept up his call for the widely con-
troversial £10,000-a-year student
fees in a recent interview with The
Guardian. He likened a science de-
gree with learning to play the violin,
which “can’t be learnt in a week,”
and condemns an apparent general
acceptance that a science degree
is cheap; “the cost of an education
at Imperial is not low and no one
should pretend it is.”
September 2006 was the first in-
take of students paying £3000 fees.
The critics’ fear, that university ap-
plicants would fall as a result and
that the new system would price
poorer students out of university,
has now been proved wrong. Appli-
cations were indeed down by 3.6%
but have now shot up for applica-
tions in 2007 by 7.1%. The system
of paying back fees after university
has also been well received; less
students now have to work over the
summer or get part-time jobs to
pay for their fees while at the same
time studying. The Conservative
Party, who were opposed to £3000
top-up fees, now admit they would
not abolish them; the university
heads and the Government appear
to have won the day.
However, many university leaders
and now the Government as well
wish to raise the cap from £3000
up to £10,000 in 2010. The support
for this is less than that for £3000
fees but still substantial, including
our own Rector. The belief is that
the price of a degree for students
should reflect the cost of running
that degree and that a university
system that works more like a mar-
ket would be healthy. This would re-
sult in humanities degrees and sci-
ence or engineering degrees with
less of a practical element costing
less than others. Biology at Impe-
rial, for example, could cost a lot
Rector renews call
for £10,000 fees
more than Biology at Oxford, which
has hardly any experimental work.
The price would not be set in
stone though; universities could
charge what they like per year up to
£10,000. Rich universities could af-
ford to charge less and so increase
their intake, and poorer universi-
ties could not. The reason this has
not happened with £3000-a-year
fees is that most institutions charge
the full amount. With £10,000, more
variation is likely. Different courses
in the same universities could cost
different amounts. Admittedly this
does not deter international stu-
dents paying hugely expensive fees,
but they have made the choice; the
students of the future will only be
able to at the risk of sacrificing a
better higher education.
What this will all mean for the
student? – that is, the student of the
most expensive university courses
– science and engineering. These
are students who are meant to be
the foundation of the future econo-
my, and the highest earners, but not
everyone wants to go into high-paid
science jobs.
Do we need more consultants and
fewer doctors? More investment
bankers and less researchers?
A student leaving after a 3-year
course could have up to £44,000 in
debt, which, if they earnt £30,000 a
year after leaving university (way
above most students’ first wage)
would still take them 7.5 years to
repay it. A medic could leave with a
debt of over £87,000.
Not everyone, of course, wants to
become a scientist when they de-
cide to do a science degree. These
higher fees have the danger of
making the elite more elitist, and
distancing complex science and
engineering more from the general
public in a country where science
A-levels and those entering teach-
ing has already fallen, a problem
that Sir Richard is very aware of.
A science degree is also needed for
teaching – not exactly
the most highly-paid job.
The universities need
the money, and the Gov-
ernment says it will not do-
nate more than £3bn a year
towards funding higher educa-
tion as not everyone enjoys this
benefit. However, if we want this sci-
ence- and engineer-based economy
to one day be fully realised, should
students be the ones to pay for it?
And is a market university culture
the best way to proceed – to add to
the stress of A-levels and academ-
ic excellence the further anxiety
about money. “Young people in the
UK today,” says Sir Richard, “par-
ticularly from the state schools, are
not able to get the qualifica-
tions to come to a place
like this.” That may
change. Poverty
will not.
Sir Richard speaks to the Guardian: “The cost of an education at
Imperial is not low and no-one should pretend that it is.”

Sir Richard Sykes, Rector of Imperial College, believes that higher fees will benefit the best universities
During a spate of racism stories in
the media, the world of the universi-
ty has been dragged into the fray as
the definition of what exactly ‘rac-
ism’ means continues to change.
PC Anthony Mulhall faces an in-
vestigation into his alleged punch-
ing of a black 20-year-old girl five
times during her arrest. The now
ex-Homeland Security adviser for
the Conservatives, Patrick Mercer,
has been fired by David Cameron,
by allegedly implying on the Times
Online website that racism in the
army is acceptable. Now Professor
DavidColemanofOxfordUniversity
has been accused of racism by stu-
dents for his views on immigration.
Students at the university, as part
of ‘Student Action for Refugees’
have started a petition calling for
Professor Coleman’s resignation
despite admitting that this would
Professor dragged into immigration racism row
never happen. Professor Coleman
is a member and co-founder of the
think tank Migration Watch UK,
which, as a body with no Govern-
ment funding, gives advice about
immigration, which it believes is
currently too prevalent. Their web-
site explains how, although they do
not see immigration as intrinsically
bad, they seek for an annual cap on
the numbers of immigrants enter-
ing the country. Professor Coleman
has been known to downplay the
benefit of immigrants to the econo-
my, saying that they donate “about
a Mars bar a month”. The website
goes on to say: “The impact on GDP
per head is a small fraction of 1%.
In Britain, congestion costs prob-
ably wipe that out.” What exactly
this means in terms of past, future,
sample size and who exactly they
include as ‘immigrants’ remains
unclear.
Whether or not you agree with
Professor Coleman’s views, voices
in support of freedom of speech,
especially at a university, have
pointed out that they are certainly
not racist. Evan Harris, the MP
for Oxford West has said that
the professor’s remarks were
“legal” and so he should have
no fear of retribution from his
employer.
David Coleman has
been called ‘racist’
but his views are for a
reformofimmigration
policy. Even if they
are entirely anti-
immigrant, they
are not racist. His
points are economi-
cal and social, not racial.
When compared to the two
other academics of recent times
who have been accused of racism,
the fuss about Professor Coleman
is hard to understand. Satoshi
Kanazawa of LSE claimed in a pa-
per that “African states were poor
and suffered ill-health be-
cause their populations were less
intelligent than people in richer
countries.” Meanwhile Frank Ellis
of Leeds University has told the stu-
dent newspaper that “black people
and women were genetically intel-
lectually inferior.” He then became
the first university lecturer to be
suspend- ed under the 2000
Race Relations
(Amendment) Act.
