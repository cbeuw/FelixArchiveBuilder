A pigeonhole waiting to be used. Guilds' elect their Vice-President today.
BY LYNN BRAVEY
Hustings were held last Tuesday for
the post of Vice-President in the
City and Guilds College Union
( C & G C U ) . Hopeful candidates
pledged themselves to improving
student involvement in C & G C U
affairs if they are elected.
"Union meetings will be better
publicised and a greater diversity of
students encouraged to take part in
them," promised Benjamin Maxwell,
speaking at the Hustings.
He also stated that this would be
done by "better communication
between the Union and departmental
representatives."
Fellow candidate, Steve
Hoborough, echoed these views by
suggesting that "college media
should be used to it's full
advantage". He added: "I've also
been doing the job for six weeks."
The hustings were poorly
attended, though Mark Walton,
Honorary Secretary and Returning
Officer for the election, commented
that it was "good to have interest
from freshers". Paul Griffith,
President of the C & G C U said that
it was "the fist time a vote has been
taken for an individual post". The
results of the election will be
announced tonight.
The Royal College of Science
Union also held elections this
week. Four members of their
committee were elected on Monday
at their Union General Meeting.
These were Stephen Dorman,
Honorary Secretary; Chris Barry,
Broadsheet Editor; Sean Rands,
Assistant Broadsheet Editor; Simon
Cooper, Archivist.
When asked to comment on his
appointment, Stephen Dorman said,
"It was nice to receive acknowl-
edgement for a job that I've been
doing for four weeks anyway!".

£19,000 BT Fraud
BY MICHAEL INGRAM
An ex-student of Imperial College
was arrested this week ending a
long-running telephone fraud. The
man, who cannot be named, wired
into the British Telecom system in
order to avoid paying international
phone charges. Before being
caught, he is alleged to have made
over £19,000 worth of calls to
Malaysia, mostly at night.
The man had previously studied
for an M S c degree at Imperial
College, which he failed despite
high marks in project work.
After discovering the fraud,
British Telecom traced the calls to
a house in Earls Court Square,.
which had been previously
occupied by the ex-student. The
police and Imperial College
security were brought in, and a
suspect identified.
A stake-out was set up in order
to watch the house, which the man
had vacated in September. In the
early hours of Sunday Morning,
while a call was being made,
technicians disconnected the phone
line to the house. A short time later,
the man emerged from a
neighbouring house and attempted
to reconnect the line. He was
arrested and taken to Kensington
police station.
The man could not be charged
immediately as he fell asleep in the
station while waiting to be
questioned. A s police codes of
practice prevent the waking of
detainees, he was ordered to return
for questioning on Wednesday. The
man was formally charged of fraud
yesterday.
Sir Frank Cooper, Chairman of
Imperial College's Governing
Body, celebrates his 71st birthday
on Thursday. Felix wishes him
many happy returns.
