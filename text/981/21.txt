Success!
Dear Felix,
I am pleased to note that the Overseas Week
which was held between the 15th and 19th
November was a huge success with a total of
119 overseas societies participating this year.
On behalf of the OSC Exec, I would like to take
this opportunity to thank those involved for their
participation, particularly:
Monday: Malaysian, Indian, Japanese, Lebanese
Tuesday: Mauritian, Chinese, Cypriot, Hellenic
Wednesday: Singapore, Sri Lankan, French,
Friends of Palestine
Thursday: Thai, Pakistan, CSSA, Iranian
Friday: Taiwan, Turkish, Scandinavian
Through the variety of posters, brochures,
demonstrations, arts and crafts, traditional
costumes you have done well to contribute to
the atmosphere of cultural diversity on each day
at the Overseas Week and by doing so have
promoted your culture, tradition and country to
the other members of the College be they home
or overseas students. Well done! We look for-
ward to your enthusiastic participation through-
out this year - particularly International Night!
Also a big welcome to the newly formed
Afro-Caribbean Society - we look forward to
you presence in future OSC activities.
Sangharan Ratnam, Civ Eng III
OSC Vice Chair, Admin and Events.
Editorial
But That's Almost An Armful!
If you've been listening to the radio recently or
watching the news, you will have noticed that
there is a campaign asking people to donate
blood. Stocks are currently dangerously low and
people are desperately needed to donate. If, like
me, you've been wanting to give blood, but
haven't managed to get round to it yet, there is
an opportunity to give an armful today in
Southside G y m . The first session starts at
9.45am with the latest arrival time being
11.15am. The second session is from 2.15pm to
4pm. If you haven't donated before, then don't
worry, it's almost painless and you even get a
drink and biccies afterwards!
Tribute
In last Friday's edition of the Evening Standard
there was an article about a planned memorial to
Freddie Mercury. Apparently, this is to be
erected in the 'main courtyard of Imperial
College'. Now, the only courtyard-type area I
can think of is Beit Quad. Does this mean that
we can expect a bronze statue of this pop idol to
be gracing the front of the Union Building? I
personally think it would look a bit out of place.
They'd be better off putting a concrete slab in
the ground or a plaque on the wall. We could
even have a sign saying 'Freddie Played Here'.
And why have they chosen Imperial College for
it? Apparently to stop the fans turning into a
shrine. So, instead Freddie will probably end up
with a traffic cone on his head and a collection
of skiffs around the base.
Red Ribbons
Next Wednesday is World AIDS Day and there
is an article on page 17 of this week's Felix
about it. The Union are asking you to pick up
and wear one of the red ribbons which
symbolise A I D S awareness. They will be
available from the JCR and the Union Building
on the day. World AIDS Day isn't another
campaign begging for donations. Instead, it
wants you to think about HIV and AIDS and to
know the risks and precautions you can take.
Advanced Warning
The last issue of Felix this term (out on the last
day of term) will be a Christmas Special. If you
have any articles with a Christmassy feel to
them, can you get them in as soon as possible
and at the latest by Wednesday 18th December.
The format may be slightly different, with the
issue being split into two parts, one containing
the news, clubs articles and reviews and the
other being a Christmas supplement. It all
depends on how much Christmassy stuff we
receive. So, it's up to you. If you want a
Christmas supplement, get scribbling!
