Cadogan To
Be DG
BY JOE MCFADDEN
Sir John Cadogan, visiting
Professor of Chemistry at Imperial
College, has been appointed
Director General of Research
Councils. He has responsibility
over the Government's Science and
Engineering strategy in the wake of
the Science White Paper. Sir John
will advise on funding decisions for
university science, which has a
budget of over one billion pounds
per year. He retired last year as
Director of Research at BP, where
he had introduced an improved
system of Research and
Development funding. In an
interview with Felix, Sir John said
he was 'delighted and overawed'
by the announcement, seeing it as a
"great opportunity to do something
for science."
Sir John's appointment
continues the Government's policy
of improving the partnership
between university science and
industry. Both new Research
Councils have also appointed
Chairmen with backgrounds in
industry. William Waldegrave,
Minister for Science, said he was
"delighted to have John Cadogan as
the first Director General".
John Patten announces reforms of Students'
Unions in the new Education Bill
Student Union Reform in
Education Bill
BY ANDREW TSENG,
NEWS EDITOR
The Government has come under
intense criticism from student
leaders this week after the pub-
lication of the Education Bill. In
what has been seen by some
observers as an Anti-National
Union of Students (NUS) bill, the
Education B i l l , published this
Wednesday, introduces a 'core' and
'non-core' funding structure.
It demands that campus unions
ballot members annually over
affiliation to the NUS. John Patten,
Education Secretary, in a statement
said, 'the Government has already
abolished the closed shop in the
Trade Union sector. Now we want
to give students the power to
choose for themselves what col-
lective involvement they want'.
Lorna Fitzsimons, President of
the N U S , denounced the bill as
lacking 'all detail and fact, but will
give power to the Secretary of State
to decide upon whatever
regulations he deems fit'.
What classifies as being 'core'
funded has been left unclear. The
bill states that public money may
only be used for services 'specified
by regulations made by the Sec-
retary of State'. Ms Fitzsimons,
accusing John Patten of ignoring
the results of his 'consultation exer-
cise' said, "It must be made clear to
Parliament, to the public and to
students, exactly what this Bill will
entail - which student union
activities will be publicly funded
and which will be funded by the
individual student."
However, Government sources
have said that segregating 'core'
from 'non-core' services in an
executive decision rather than a
parliamentary bill will allow for
more discretion and may permit
social societies, for example, to be
directly funded as core bodies.
Those non-political societies not
classified as core may still retain
university and Government
funding, say insiders.
Andrew Wensley, President of
Imperial College Union, said, "The
minister seems to have ignored the
majority of comments put to him,
by student unions, academics and
universities during five-months of
consultation."
The bill, introduced in the
House of Lords is being spear-
headed by Education Minister,
Baroness Blatch. As yet Mr Patten
has made no comment on the bill in
the House of Commons.
