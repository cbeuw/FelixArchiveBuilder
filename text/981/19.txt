Quicksand
Slip
The theme for the album is that of rock riffs and
aggressive vocals, reliant on chunky rhythms for
appeal. But where Rage Against The Machine
are on occasion fluid and funky, Quicksand
remain resolutely a rock band, and come off the
worse for it. There is the odd snatch of a tune,
but not enough to rescue the songs from the
'competent but unexciting' file, which sadly
grows ever larger. As if to add insult to injury,
the wonderful melody of 'How Soon Is Now' is
flattened out by the screaming vocalist and, of
course, Jonny Marr's delicate guitar work is
nowhere to be heard. The best plan for
Quicksand is to invent a time machine, go back
three years, release this album and take the
world by storm. Failing that, they must live in
the shadow of the rest of the hardcore world. (5)

Volume 8
The Volume series have unfurled themselves
onto our consciences once again. Already in it's
eighth publication, they cleverly amalgamate a
200 page book brimming with interviews, with a
CD tucked neatly at the back. Recently they
began to bridge the often huge chasm between
indie and techno. Now Volume 8 has a healthy
50-50 mix.
Cerebral cognoscenti will not be disap-
pointed as the best in British trance talent, such
as Autechre and Higher Intelligence Agency, are
here, while floppy-haired indie kids will be free
to masturbate over the newly recorded and
previously unreleased Elastica track 'S.O.F.T'.
The Sultans of Ping's track is ridiculously
tiresome, but there is added bonus of an extra
'hidden' song. They should learn some lessons
in weirdness from the Butthole Surfers, present
here in glorious Technicolor. Other notables
include James and the Wonderstuff, their mixes
strive to blur the musical dichotomy.
Back on the looping front, B12, who gave us
the 'Soma', elevate once again with 'Scriptures'
and Curve just know what it's all about.
Unplug yourself from conditioned percep-
tions, listen to Volume and though this has
become a naff clich6, expand your mind. Unity
is what it's at. (7)

Eric's Trip
Love Tara
While the major labels divided up the spoils in
Seattle, Sub Pop began looking further afield for
new talent. In Canada they found Sloan and,
through them, discovered a hotbed of new talent.
This yielded the 'Never Mind The Molluscs' EP
featuring the aforementioned and Eric's Trip,
amongst others. Shortly after this the Trip
released a single, 'Songs About Chris' then a
critically acclaimed mini album, 'Peter' before
this, their first full length LP.
Their songs combine delicate melodies with
vicious bursts of guitar feedback. With three of
the band sharing vocals, the album contains a
diverse collection of songs with the listener
never knowing what to expect next. Two years
ago this album would have had stardom
stamped all over it, but now, unfortunately, it
may just slip though the net. (7)

Mr. Dash and the underground label? Every
week it's the same story.)

No Alternative
Aids kills. Wear/watch-worn a condom. Buy
this album and some of your money will go to
Aids research. Here the music is what matters.
Sounding like the latest mutation of the virus
itself, Mathew Sweet kicks off and promptly
falls over with 'Superdeformed'. Buffalo Tom
are palatable but Soul Asylum need more then
'Sexual Healing' to repair their lacklustre cover.
Brilliance rides in again with the silver cuff links
and shiny Cadillacs of Urge Overkill. 'Take A
Walk' has more salty depth to it then most MOR
bank-breakers manage in a career. Changing tack
and sailing into blacker winds, American Music
Club contribute the lusty, twisted 'All Your Jeans
Were Too Tight' - there's never been a better
advert for a life of sleaze. Methadone for the
addicted?
Goo Goo Dolls 'Bitch' about something
followed by the albums real gem. Probably the
greatest song they will ever record in an evening,
'The Unseen Power Of The Picket Fence' has
Pavement doing for REM what Langland did for
Piers Ploughman. A low-fi funky tongue in cheek
tour-de-force. Smashing Pumpkins wheel out
'Glynis' and Bob Mould's been a lot less average
then his incarnation on 'Can't Fight It'. Most of
the best flares and fades behind.
Salvation. Five likable efforts on and suddenly
we're ascending and flying over the smoky
landscape conspired by Uncle Tupello with
'Effigy'. Weren't the Beastie Boys BC let along
pre-Aids? Still, 'It's The New Style'. The
Breeder's spawn 'Iris' and Patti Smith is strangely
touching with her 'Memorial Tribute' - like mental
patients are when flying over the cuckoos nest.
The secret track? Usual stuff, verse, chorus,
verse - oh, never mind. (8)

Bryan Adams
So Far So Good
To many people, it will come as a surprise that
Bryan Adams existed before 'Everything I Do',
but apparently he did and this 'best o f album
concentrates on the early 80s and 'Reckless.'
I suppose these are a typical cross section of
his work, but when played back to back, they all
seem to merge together. This may be typical of
a 'best o f album, but eventually his husky voice
and the backing instruments all mix into one
monotonous tune. The only variety, such as it is,
is whether the song is fast or slow. (5)
