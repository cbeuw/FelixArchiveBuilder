Soon will we show them
Our Signs in the (furthest)
Regions (of the earth), and
In their own souls, until
It becomes manifest to
them
That this is the Tuth.
Is it not enough that
Thy Lord doth witness All
things?
Ah indeed ! are they
In doubt concerning
The meeting with their
Lord?
Ah indeed ! It is He
That doth encompass
All things!
