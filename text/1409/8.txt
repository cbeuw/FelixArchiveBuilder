Virgo
You get arrested
for giving STD’s to
the Freshers. Why
did you do it? You
weren’t actually
dying this week.
You will now spend the rest of your life in
prison, where it is shank or be shanked... in
the ass. Don’t worry though, you’ll only have
to drop the soap for another week; that is until
you also die of internal bleeding. Mr Hands
anyone??!? 2 guys 1 horse, check it.
Scorpio
This week you
and your partner
will decide to take
your relationship
to the next level
by being more
open with other people. Next time you meet
a ridiculously handsome specimen of a man,
who works in the Felix office and has a sick
sense of humour, sleep with him. Take that
chance. You won’t regret it until the doctor
tells you you’re pregnant. Honest.
Libra
It will be a rather
quiet week for you;
an absence of bad
influences provides
a welcome break
after the hectic,
roller-coaster ride that has been the last 2
drug-filled weeks. Make the most of it: Use the
evenings for some chill-out time in order to
indulge/pleasure yourself to The Best of Barry
White.
Sagittarius
This week you
were working for
Imperial College
residences, making
the Welcome Packs
that all freshers find
in their room upon arrival at their halls. What
nobody knows is that you used a needle to put
holes in every single condom handed out to
freshers. That’s right, if you sleep with anyone
you will become a parent. See, it’s easy to find
excuses to why you’re not getting any.
Capricorn
This week you type
the final words of
the 1st edition of
Felix 2008/2009.
You tell yourself that
you’ve done a good
job and that the Freshers will enjoy it and that
they will join the team and continue to read
Felix throughout the year. You tell yourself that
if they don’t you will take a knife and cut off
their digits, slowly, one by one.
Cancer
In a strange
coincidence you
have cancer. How
funny. The doctors
will tell you it had
something to do
with spending all of your day in front of the
computer. Jupiter demands you stop this right
away. It’s wrong to watch german scheize porn
all day while you danger crank. Stop now and
you’ll be granted a swift but still painful death.
Gemini
Being a socially
inept bastard has
hardened you. This
week you’ll make
millions by investing
in the economy (no
seriously). Looks like being a wanker paid off.
Unfortunately to get your funds you are forced
to give your account details to a nigerian man
called Lenard. He steals your money, sleeps
with your wife and burns your house down.
Serves you right for being successful.
Leo
You will die this
week. I read it in
my tea leaves. It was
either death or lots
of sex... followed by
death. There’s no
way out now. I see you doing something more
meaningful with your time left. Something
along the lines of helping children becoming
terminally ill. I mean giving STD’s to pristine
freshers. I mean... I’m sorry I can’t think of
anything thats not offensive! Help me.
Taurus
This week your
friends have
changed the lan-
guage settings on
Facebook to English
(pirate). Not to feel
left out you promptly do the same. Too bad
you don’t have a fucking clue what anything
means. While the other kids played pirate,
you were playing merchant banker. Who’s the
wanker now? You! Thats who! The gods do not
favour you. Not at all.
Aries
This week the only
people turning up
to your funeral is
your mother and
your illegitmate
child. I would use
the word funeral very loosely. A more accurate
description is your body being buried at the
bottom of a council dumpster. Don’t worry;
your after life won’t get any worse. It won’t get
any better either. Fail.
Pisces
This week, a blood
test reveals high
amounts of THC in
your blood. This just
confirms everyone’s
suspicions that
you’re a drag on the economy and solely to
blame for the current credit crisis. The former
CEO of Lehman Brothers phones you up
and curses to you to hell. Added to this, all
Imperial students hate you because they won’t
get jobs as bankers anymore... lol
Horoscopes. Abusive, sick & morbid. The way they should be.
Aquarius
This week you ar-
rive at university full
of life, ambition and
good intentons. Too
bad you’re a CUNT!
That’s right, you
know it, the heavens know it and everyone else
at IC knows it. Only one thing left for you to
do; and that is to throw yourself from the top
of the Beit compound. Imagine it now, your
body splattered across the quad. Pidgeons
feeding off your corpse.
Don’t ever do badly-dressed girls
I
f you are reading this, chances
are you are a dude. If you are a
dude, more likely than not, you
have trouble getting laid. If you
are a dude at Imperial, the out-
look is even more grim and I highly
doubt you will get any action
whatsoever this year. This is
mostly due to the fact that
you study something incred-
ibly lame like Geopetroleum
Science, have long greasy black
hair and look like more of a tool
than your cousin who’s ranked 7th
in the county for Magic The Gath-
ering. Yes you will hear this a lot but
thats just because I have lots of sex and
I like to rub it in.
If, for some odd reason, you man-
aged to fall through the sieve and are
not absurdly hideous, you may just
have some luck with any of the 7 girls
on campus. (I am sleeping with 3 out
of 7 as I write this... just so you know
you’ll be getting sloppy seconds).
So as the only man on campus who
has other people to jack him off, let me
give you some sock-rocking advice.
Do NOT have sex with girls wear-
ing ordinary clothes. Period. By this, I
meanshittyjeansfromTopshop,dread-
ful Camden t-shirts and faded brown
oversized pleather boots from “this re-
ally cute vintage place in Shoreditch”.
You may be thinking you’ll undress
the bitch so fast it won’t matter. Given
your lack of expertise in the field, you
are clearly wrong. Also an idiot. And
also a failure at life, but that’s beside
point. If you take a girl up to the minis-
cule box you have christened a room,
you will have to watch her take it all
off, and because her clothes suck, it’ll
take forever. She’ll undo her laces, re-
move her shoes and you will witness
her ghastly white socks that have seen
worse days than a Vietnamese hooker
in central Hanoi. Her badly cut toenails
will ensure you will lose any prospect
of a boner for the next couple of years.
You see fashion is a great indication
of what the girl will be like. Horrible
socks, horrible toe-nails. Terrible lip-
stick, terrible blow-jobs. Do you get
what I’m saying?
The solution to this problem is Slutty
underwear. You must at all times keep
in your room trashy lingerie for po-
tential female visitors (hopefully only
those not related to you by blood).
The second the subject walks in, you
direct her to the bathroom and give
her exactly 2 minutes to get changed
into the corset and stockings. If she
fails at this, it clearly means she is
unable to follow directions and
instruction from those in posi-
tions of authority. At this stage
you must remember why the
dominant alpha male has per-
sistently been better at most
stuff than XX chromosome
beings and promptly kick her
out of your room. No discus-
sion, no moronic questions. By the
way, all men at Imperial are badly
dressed. Literally no exceptions.
Except me.
