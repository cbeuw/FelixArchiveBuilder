Going Dutch on King’s Road
The place is far from fancy. The
chairs are wooden, stupidly hard and
not surprisingly, uncomfortable. The
waitresses are not exceptionally nice
and a lot more could be said for the
ambience from the second you walk in.
The lighting is somewhat harsh and on
a Friday or Saturday, it gets loud. Very
It’s like pizza. But on a pancake, hence better. Ultimate comfort food close to Imperial.
loud. It is not the kind of mildly inter-
esting noise you get at a Belgian beer
house, but one more reminiscent of
the dissonant waking call for an early
morning hunt in the Paleolithic. The
people stop being people and they be-
come one thing only: incredibly pow-
erful and driven eating machines, be-
cause it is in the food that the strength
of this place lies. While it is not refined
in the slightest, there is a kind of deli-
cacy and frailness to it that makes it
appealing despite the initially intimi-
dating portion sizes.

unconvincing, but there’s actually a
gem in there. I am not usually a fan of

real wine, but their Domaine d’Astros

is nothing short of brilliant. I tried it
last summer in Cannes and it is better
than I remembered it to be. They also
do some awesome thick milkshakes,
albeit in a pitiful 3 flavours.
The starters list looks pretty decent,
and if you’re anything like me, you’ll
be pretty tempted to try the kaasbal-
len, deep-fried balls of mozzarella
and cheddar, onion and breadcrumbs.
They’re not half-bad, but truth be
told their nachos are clearly superior.
They’re just as cheesy as they need be
and the home-made creams and sauc-
es are brilliant.
You did not walk 25 minutes to Chel-
sea to have starters and drinks though.
The pancakes are the appogee of this
place. Imagine a pizza. Now, remove
the soggy tomato sauce and replace
the base with a scrumptuous, massive
pancake. Add bacon, cheese, chicken,
Delicious calorie bomb puddings
3/4 cup of butter at room temperature
1/3 cup of powdered sugar
1 tsp vanilla extract
a pinch of salt
1.5 cups of plain flour
3/4 cup finely chopped pecans
powdered sugar for dusting
Preheat the oven to 170C. Lightly grease baking trays or line with some
sort of parchment.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until it is lightly and
totally fluffy. Now, add the vanilla salt, flour and nuts. Mix well. Roll the
stuff into 3/4 inch balls and place them on a baking tray at least 1 inch
apart; otherwise hell will break loose.
Bake the stuff for like 15 minutes or until they are kinda brown. Dust
them with the powdered sugar while they’re still warm and let them cool
completely.
At this stage, you may want to spice things up. Just take the snowdrops
and dip the bottom of each one into some melted milk chocolate and
leave them on a flat, parchment cover to set.
Offer them to your boyfriend/girlfriend to guarantee some cuddling.
1.25 cups heavy cream
handful of Earl/Lady Grey tea leavs
5 oz extra-dark chocolate, hella finely chopped
10 oz dark chocolate
cocoa powder
Bring the cream and tea leaves to a simmer in a small saucepan and let
the mixture infuse for a couple of minutes over low heat. Remove from
heat and leave to stand for a minute.
Place the extra-dark chocolate in a bowl and strain the cream infusion
over the chocolate and let it sit for a couple of minutes until the choco-
late has melted. Stir the mixture gently until it’s smooth and combined.
Do not stir loads or the chocolate will separate. Cover the stuff and chill
for at least 4 hours until set.
Melt the dark chocolate in a double boiler over low heat, then remove.
Leave it to cool down a bit, so that it’s still liquid. Using a fork, dip the
truffles on by one into the chocolate and remove before the ganache
melts. Immediately drop into sifted cocoa powder on a large, deep plate
and roll gently. Leave the truffles in the cocoa powder until the chocolate
has set. They’re best served at room temperature but can be refriger-
ated to make them last longer.

elcome to the new-
ly reintroduced
Food section. This
year, it will be ed-
ited by the very
very lovely Ms Rosie Grayburn and
myself. I did enjoy writing the business
section last year, but I feel it’s time for
something a little bit more sinful. In a
good way. Sometimes I’ll do a whole
issue, sometimes Rosie will; sometime
we will collaborate. We want to keep it
relatively funny.
While this section is primarily based
around recipes and reviews of restau-
rants we believe students will get a kick
out of, we want to add a bit of a twist
this year. We will therefore be organ-
ising dinners, cooking parties, drink-
ing evenings, tastings, visits to farm-
ers’ markets and organic farms – the
works. Obviously we don’t want to do
this alone and we would absolutely love
for our readers to join us; provided you
are genuinely passionate about food
and gastronomy and want to be around
people who care about this stuff too.
We will not only be ranting about
food, but also fine drink and the more
technical and nerdy side of food. There
will be obscure references to McGee’s
On Food and Cooking: known to en-
thusiasts of merrymaking as The Bible.
I will also try to give some insight into
the incredible world that is molelecu-
lar gastronomy made famous (but not
invented) by Heston Blumenthal and
written about at length by Dr Charles
Spence, the experimental psychologist
and food enthusiast-in-chief at Oxford
University.
Another goal of this section is to in-
still in you not only a passion, but more
importantly the aptitude to become a
confident and competent cook. I be-
lieve I started out on the wrong foot
given that my first two recipes are not
the simplest or the least pretentious
to prepare. As pointed out to me by
Gilead Amit, things need to be taken
slowly. As of next week, therefore, that
is how I will proceed. I will avoid pat-
ronising you and as such, will not be
instructing you how to boil pasta or
rice, but perhaps give you slight varia-
tions of the basics and hopefully make
them less boring and uninteresting.
It would be fabulous if you, the read-
er, were to chip in with a recipe or a
restaurant review once in a while. Just
email it to us at food.felix@imperial.
ac.uk. While we will be doing a lot of
reviewing ourselves, there are just
too many great places in London to
visit, and while we’d adore eating at
all of them, this is most likely not go-
ing to happen. We wouldn’t mind that
incredible recipe you got from your
grandmother for a killer crab risotto.
Finally come see us at felix’s Fresh-
ers’ Fair stall. We’re relatively nice and
our bite is not too deep. All the sub-
editors are there and even if you don’t
want to contribute to our section, you
might see something that sparks your
interest or may even have an idea for
something completely new.
The 1958 stands for the number of ingredients you chuck on the plate
chives, olives, haloumi, sweetcorn,
sundried tomato.... Drool. Eat. Contin-
ue eating. Possibly repeat. Any combi-
nation of ingredients is possible. Crea-
tive flairs are highly encouraged and
strange concoctions are not frowned
upon. If you can still stomach pudding
after all of this, try somewhere else;
desserts here are not the best.
Were I suggesting this restaurant to
either one of my parents, I’d probably
be rating it 2 stars; mostly due to less-
than-ideal service and general feel of
the place. Given the quality of the food,
uniqueness, quantity and, most impor-
tant for students, Price:Quality:Portion
Size ratio, it provides absolutely un-
beatable value. This is especially true
on Mondays when all pancakes are
reduced to £5. For most dishes, this is
actually less than half price. I hope you
enjoy our humble recommendation.
After the pancake... there are waffles. After waffles. There’s other stuff.

begin any second, and I hope that this
small monochrome offering will be
able to help you get through it.
Over the coming year, with any luck,
I should be able to tease and torment
you, elicit satisfaction and frustration,
and provide you with some moments
of joy to illuminate the sea of pain we
inhabit. Sorry; black and white squares
bring out the existentialist in me.
