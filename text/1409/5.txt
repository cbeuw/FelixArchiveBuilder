Some workshops will be repeated at Silwood Park Campus, see our
website for details:
SHOT GLASSES: Dan
came to Imperial with
25, and had as many new
friends by the end of the
first night. Coincidence?
Probably.
FISH FINGERS: Emergency food
that’s good to go in 10 mintues.
Sandwich between some bread,
squirt with ketchup and you’ve
got your fill of Omega-3 for the
week.
OYSTER CARD: Don’t bother
travelling around London without
one. Take it to a ticket booth at
the tube station with your Young
Person’s Railcard and they’ll put a
cap on your day travelcards too.
LOO ROLL: Never underestimate
the usefulness of a spare roll.
EAR PLUGS: Snoring
roommate? Neighbour has
a fondness for Linkin Park?
These mean you might get
some sleep before the riveting
day of lectures tomorrow.
REGGAE REGGAE SAUCE:
No matter how disastrous
your cooking attempts, a
splash of this jerk sauce
will make your pasta
edible again. Use to liven
up chicken, and even
sandwiches.
WAITER’S FRIEND: It’s not
clever to crack bottles open
with your teeth- the waiter’s
friend has everything you need
whilst keeping your enamels
intact. It can handle wine
bottles and stubbies. Useful.
BAG FOR LIFE: Plastic
bags have bad press for
all the right reasons.
Pack away a cotton or
supermarket bag for life
in the bottom of your bag
every day so you’re not
caught off-guard by an
impromptu shop in Tesco
Metro.
USB STICK: Indispensable. Don’t
get one where you can lose the cap,
though. The Union shop sells them in
different sizes.
A few essential home comforts
FEBREZE: Some of your rooms
might smell a bit funky when you
arrive. Febreze is a god-send for
stagnant matresses, stinky trainers
and jackets you can’t be bothered
to take to the dry cleaners.
ETHERNET CABLE: A must for
connecting to the web from the
comfort of your own room. Ravi’s
flogging them for a couple of quid
(if you can find him).
EXTENSION LEAD: I know you were
told not to bring one. But when the
only socket in your room happens to
be across the room from where you
want to install your TV, there’s no
other way.
WARM COAT: Don’t forget London
can get bloody cold in the Winter
Months. Throw in a scarf, some
gloves and a woolly hat for the
whole look and you’re good to
WATER BOTTLE:
Embrace the inner
geek who misses their
mum. Don’t splash out
on £1 bottles of water
in college when you
can fill up at home for
a fraction of the price.
Normal bottles leach
nasty stuff if you fill
them up too many
times.
UMBRELLA: We’ve had
the wettest August ever
on record. Unfortunately
things aren’t going to get
any better. Expect some
torrential downpours and
some annoying drizzle in
the upcoming months.

I have to start by admitting that hu-
mour isn’t my forte. While others thrive
on making jibes about life at Imperial, I
tend to focus on practicalities and how
we can improve your time here. I know
that boys outnumber girls 2:1, that the
games section will get more readers
than the fashion pages and that, come
Easter, a seat in the library will become
more elusive than Bigfoot. The follow-
ing weeks are going to be a rollercoast-
er of ups and downs for most of you.
The friends you make over the follow-
ing year may turn out to be the ones
that stay with you for all your life, so do
everything you can to get out there and
meet them!
If you’re having personal problems
or are struggling with your workload
there’s a number of people you can
turn to. Let someone know you’re
struggling, be it friends, your personal
tutor, one of the wardens in your halls
or myself in the Union. We also have
a dedicated Student Adviser, Nigel
Cooke. He works in the Advice Centre
in the East Wing of the Student Union
and specialises in the following areas
of advice:
• Academic Appeals and Complaints
• Debt Advice
• Housing Rights
• Employment Rights
• Consumer Rights
• Personal Safety
• International Students Issues
Nigel also has links with all the Col-
lege welfare services and also legal
advice centres in the local community
so if he can’t help we can find some-
one who will be able to locally. We are
also full members of Advice UK which
is an agency which encourages good
practice in advice centres around the
country. The Advice Centre acts as an
advocate for students; to College and
also to outside organisations when we
feel a student needs extra help to solve
an issue, acting on your behalf with
your permission.
Both Nigel and myself are in close
contact with the College welfare serv-
ices, including the Health Centre, Stu-
dent Counselling Service, Careers Ad-
visory Service and Disability Officer.
Over the upcoming months there will
be a number of articles and picture sto-
ries in this welfare section highlighting
issues that may affect students during
their time at Imperial.
Both of us will be at Freshers’ Fair
handing out our weight in condoms
and other goodies, so if you have any
questions or want to say hello, pop
over and see us. I’ll especially be focus-
ing on distributing leaflets advising you
on how to get exemptions from Pre-
scription Charges if you are on a low
income. They don’t take your parent’s
income into account so that should in-
clude most of you...
On the left are a few of the items that
you might not have packed, so get your
parents to take you on one last shop to
fill up your cupboards and then get on
your way to the Union!
