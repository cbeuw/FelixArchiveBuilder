Stuff IC Students Like!? :)
Photoshop Competition !!!
Ravi Pall
Editor in Legend
A
big welcome to the new
year from myself. I am
the Coffee Break Editor.
At this point I would like
to mention that I don’t
normally look like a pirate, although
I’m starting to believe otherwise from
all the comments I receive. I’m even
thinking of taking off the eye patch af-
ter ten months.
This year I hope to bring to you a
different side to felix. Coffee Break has
been given a budget of £1 bajillion so
you can expect lots of light humour,
competitions and light reading arti-
cles that’ll bring a smile to your face
(results may vary). For those of you
who remember Coffee Break... forget
it. The only thing I can see returning
is the FUCWIT league and the com-
petitions. Admitedly that is all Coffee
Break was before, but it’s different this
time. That’s right; no more David Has-
slehoff, Chuck Norris or competent
editing. Come on, did you really think
they were good role models for the av-
erage Imperial student? No. They were
way too homoerotic. However, there
will be some new charcters that some
would say are more student targeted....
Sikh MC comes to mind. Thats right,
I’m Indian, and the first thing I intro-
duce is an Punjabi gangster rapper.
Also look out for Snakey B, the pint
of snake bite with a pint and a half of
uncommon sense. This totally had
nothing to do with being so drunk you
think your pint is talking to you. We’ve
all been there. We’ve all done it.
What am I currently doing for you,
the eager, loyal Impeial College wast-
ers? Well first off I made this super
pullout with the Hangman Team. It
was hard work, but I can already tell
you guys ‘n’ gals will love it. It is with
great modesty I claim that this pullout
is the greatest thing this newspaper has
ever seen. Too bad some editors didn’t
make the effort; resulting in the welfare
page. Well thats enough on boosting
my ego. What else will I be doing for
you? How about iPods. As mentioned
before we have a budget this year.
Money = Prizes. Currently I’m tring to
haggle as many iPods as I can for you
music lovin’ peeps to win in the afore-
mention FUCKWIT league. Not only
iPods, video games aswell. Courtesy of
Gamestation Hounslow, video games
should be on the way. What games?
Who knows, but it’s free. That’s all we
students care about really. It’s like Yogi
Bear and picnic baskets.
BTW if you like/dislike anything you
read on these pages, tough. I have no
control over Hangman. It’s purely coin-
cidental that we’re in the same section.

1. Calculus:
Mention Calculus to any normal guy
and they’ll shiver as bad as felix cat
submerged in a bucket of ice. Stu-
dents of Imperial College, however,
are not normal. It may have some-
thing to do with the high percent-
age of overseas students, but isn’t it
more likely due to the hours of fun
one can have integrating spherical
polar co-ordinates? Don’t kid your-
self by saying you don’t know what
that means... you do! and you like it.
I’ve see many an IC student make
the log cabin joke, and even more
students laughing back. This merely
validates this week’s entry to the
“Stuff IC Students Like” list. Excuse
the cliché, but “Only at Imperial” do
the words “let’s perform calculus in
Covent Garden to raise money” get
spoken.
Let’s face it, even the chatup lines
involve calculus. Ever heard “I wish I
were your differential so I could lay
tanget to your curves” before? No?
Yeah?.... Yeah you have.

2. pr0n:
There is a very sound reason Imperial
kids are enamored with pornography.
Apart from an unhealthy obsession
with all things nerdy, porn is the one
element that brings all Imperial guys
together. Bashing the bishop over
some rotter being pounded to an inch
of her life is only bettered by the su-
per-fast T1, designed for education,
internet connection in your halls.
You see, in a College of only 8 girls
that aren’t uglier than Ann Wide-
combe the lonely male student will
quickly turn to massivehooters.com
to quell those desires that haunt us all.
Personally I like the more camp web-
sites like nakedboysinhats.org and
nodaddynotthathard.co.uk.
Please note, though, that College
ICT may get annoyed if they find
you have been downloading enough
porn to shock Ted Bundy. If this does
happen, your internet access may be
banned for a short time and you may
have to resort to stealing Wi-Fi off the
Church next door. In case you were
wondering, the password is “isome-
timesfucknuns”. Super.

London is too cool for You
A
re you 18 or 19? Do you
like to party? Are you
ready to rock London to
its foundations? Yeah?
Sorry no.
Unfortunately you are simply not
cool enough for London. In terms of
coolness, the bar is about 6ft 3 high
and you’ve barely hit 2. Confused? Let
me break it down.
Ross Goldberg
Really Fat Dead Guy
The first thing that makes you un-
cool is your choice of university. You
did one of two things. You either ap-
plied to Oxbridge and got rejected
and rejects are definitely not cool. Or
you actually put Imperial as your first
choice… oh dear.
The second thing that makes you un-
cool is your face… sorry that’s imma-
ture. The actual second reason is your
mom. Anyway, if you are anything like
every other Imperial student you do
not know how to dress. This is not a
good thing in London.
Whether you are in Oxford Street,
Shoreditch, Southbank or on the Kings
Road you will notice that people actu-
ally make an attempt to co-ordinate,
accessorise and generally wash. You
would do well to take note of this be-
haviour; especially the washing. I know
its hard to keep track of personal hy-
giene when gaming, but make an ef-
fort. To summarise: people can still
smell you through your Trackies and
hoodies (which you shouldn’t be wear-
ing anyway)
The third reason that you fail to live
up to the ridiculously high level of
coolness that we Londoners have es-
tablished is because you don’t own a
fedora hat. You are literally not allowed
to register to vote in London until you
purchase a fedora. Thats right, Ken
Livingstone lost because lefties are un-
cool and the famous ‘BJ fedora’ picture,
seen above. If you have never seen this
picture before it’s because, like the title
suggests, you are mega lame.
Sexy chat up lines for Freshers
“I SWEAR, I’m bigger
in the metric system”
“What subject
do you do? It
doesn’t matter,
get naked and
look at my
long Int type”
"I’ll give you an A for HOT"
"There's a university in
my pants, and you’re
accepted"
They worked on us, now they’ll work for us.
Places to go – Hangman recommends

A
dd Felix Hangman on fa-
cebook now. You know
you want to do it, you’ll
be the envy of all your
friends. Add us and we
promise to perhaps sometimes enter-
tain you with comical status updates,
photo raping and much much (read
much less) more. You might even get
spammed with lots of invites to awe-
some Felix Hangman events...

Go-Karting Haven.

Reporting from Iraq
O
h hai! Do not mistake
my friendliness for re-
spect. I have nothing
but the highest level of
disdain for all my peers,
especially you filthy freshers.
No, I was never a fresher. I started
university as a final year student be-
cause I have an IQ of 205 and a rich
father. Needless to say, I am better at
Maths, Engineering and getting chicks
into the 69 position than you.
Maybe the Hangman section is ‘silly’
or ‘a waste of time’ and just maybe you
won’t get half the jokes that I make.
But maybe, just maybe I fucked your
mom. If you didn’t like that little quip,
you won’t like many of my humorous
jibes. Every now and again I may offer
some useful advice or maybe you’ll un-
derstand what I’m saying to you. These
moments will be few and far between
so savour them.
This issue, worringly enough, con-
tains a number of these moments. If
you’re bored you can try checking out
some of the places we’ve recommended
(see left) or if you’re struggling to pull
members of the opposite sex (guaran-
teed) try out some of the chat-up lines
we’ve proffered for you.
It’s very likely that as a female read-
ing the Hangman section, you will
feel excluded, insulted and a general
distaste in the back of your mouth. I’ll
let you figure out what the next joke
should be. You can’t figure it out? Id-
iot, it’s SPERM! To get back to what I
was meaning to say, we don’t get much
daylight in the felix office or female
interaction (sometimes Hannah Theo-
dorou visits but she doesn’t count; if
you ever meet the DPEW, you’ll realise
why). So if you are a female Imperial
student, come on down to the Felix
office, or look for our stall at Freshers
Fair, and join our team. You can help
us add some misandry to this misogy-
nistic and misanthropic section of the
awesome felix.
I bet you fucking freshers got scared
by the big words didn’t you? FAIL.
Kensington

tra, you can have a shisha pipe in your
go-kart. Open every weekday 10:00am
to 5:00pm. £20 per person. Not only
that, if you book in advance you get a
free lollipop and a condom. Now that’s
what we call service.
