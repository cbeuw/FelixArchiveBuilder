rarely been in the office before
eleven o'clock, and had several
times been late for appointments

N o doubt you're all aware of the sad fate of the
D e Lirium motor company, whose founder has
just been arrested. T o find out the latest, I
sought out his adviser in the Belfast plant,
Paddy De Polstery, and asked him to outline
the present situation.
"Well, Sir," he said, "we've got 6916 De
Lirium cars in the hangar over there, and
they've been there for the last thirteen months.
The mechanics say that the cars are just
starting to fall apart; next month one car will
have to be disposed of, the second month four
cars will have to be disposed of, the third
month nine cars and so on. In other words, the
number of cars that will fall apart in any month
in the in the future is the square of the number
of months hence that that month is. The
Official Receiver has said that, unless a firm
steps in in time, then I shall be sacked when
the number of cars in the hangar is equal to the
number of months that the cars have been in
the hangar."
I was e x p r e s s i n g my s y m p a t h y for his
unfortunate plight, when he leaned across the
table, tapped the side of his nose conspirator-
ially and whispered.
"I've got some friends who used to work
here, though, and, starting this month, they're
going to steal into the plant and produce two
cars a month, to keep the stocks up and keep
me in a job a bit longer."
At this I bid him farewell, not wishing to tell
h i m t h a t he w o u l d k e e p his job for a
further—how many months?

Last week's solution
It was very interesting trying to decipher the
various attempts sent in to the problem of
Killinbuckton. Many people sent in '8 moves'
a t t e m p t s , but a d j u s t i n g for r e a l i s m (ie
assuming the lengths of track are slightly
longer than stated, in order to accommodate
the corners, and assuming the trains are not of
negligible width) the 'best' solution, in my
humble opinion, was that of Reg Langford of
Civ Eng 2, who can collect his £5 cheque from
the F E L I X Office after 1:30pm on Monday.
The diagrams should be self-explanatory;
both the locomotive and Pullman car are
directional, the s e c o n d class c o a c h a n d
restaurant car are not.
