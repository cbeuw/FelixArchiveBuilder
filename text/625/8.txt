REVIEW
Old Fashioned
Brilliance
Five Days One Summer, produced and
directed by Fred Zinnemann opens
Thursday October 28 at Warner West
End and Fulham ABC.
Five Days One Summer is the latest film from
one of Hollywood's most experienced and
prolific directors. Fred Zimmerman, whose.
career stretches back to just before the war. It
is, indeed, in this period, 1932 to be exact, that
he has chosen to place his new work.
Despite the fact that Sean Connery, who
plays Dr Meridith, will probably get the largest
billing in the publicity, and commands one's
attention whilst on the screen, the central
character, Kate, is played by the unknown
Betsy Brantley. The central character in any
Zimmerman film is usually in conflict with
themselves, and often with society (ie Sir
Thomas More in A Man For All Seasons) and
as the story unfolds, her dilemma becomes
clear: she is in love with an older married man.
She is by turns elated and depressed. Elated at
last to be with him on an alpine holiday;
depressed at the inevitable consequences of
her action and turn between her feelings for
the young guide and her lifelong obsession
with her uncle.
In itself, a humdrum menage a trois, but the
story, meticulously told, is set against the
b r e a t h t a k i n g b a c k d r o p of the alps. It is
sobering in a time when our minds are numbed
by special effects and dazzling sets that such
an 'old fashioned' film, using merely the natural
elements and brilliant photography, can be just
as stunning.
The film is brought to a dramatic climax as
the audience try to identify the figure in the
snow, and try to read Kate's feelings in her
face as she runs towards him.
A beautifully made film, but I couldn't
escape a feeling of deja vu. I'm sure that a film
with a very similar plot was made in the early
fifties by a British studio, I just can't remember
the title. Could anyone enlighten me?

Commemoration Day starring Brian
Flowers, Stephen Goulder, Professor
John Albery and a cast of thousands.
Directed by John Smith at the Royal
Albert Hall.
The lights d i m m e d and a deathly hush
ensued. This was the moment we had been
waiting for. P e r f o r m e d only o n c e a year,
Commemoration Day r a n k s with G d t f e r -
ddmmerung at the Bayreuth Festival and the
Passion Play at O b e r a m m e r g a u in the
international artistic calendar. People had
come for and wide for this great event,
A note on the organ, and a procession burst
forth upon the aisle. A n d how easy it was to
s p o t the f a m i l i a r commedia dell'arte
characters! All the stock figures were there:
d u n c e s , c l o w n s , q u a c k s a n d a l i b e r a l
assortment of buffoons, all dressed gaily in
their colourful robes. The procession marched
slowly to the- front of the auditorium to the
a c c o m p a n i m e n t of the most invigorating
music. How proud the great Verdi would have
been of this!
Brian Flowers rose from his seat. A lifelong
actor, his outstanding acting ability has taken
him to high places. But what a speech! What a
truly magnificent speech, and what a great
man! One is tempted recall the words of the
V i c t o r i a n p o e t a n d n a t u r a l i s t , S t a n l e y
R u m b o l d M e a d o w s w h o d i e d in t r a g i c
obscurity:
Oh mighty Zeus! Words stronger than thy
sinewy limbs.
Oh Daphne! Words fairer than thy rounded
breasts,
Oh rapturous art! Oh fair creature from
Arcady!
Yes, words more profound than the Caves
of Aad in the province of Baghdad,
Words more thrusting than the hind legs of
the South American dung beetle,
Oh sweet rapture!
Oh divine rapture!
Oh heavenly bliss!
etc etc
Great though Flowers' oratory was, it was,
alas, totally devoid of any gesticulation. A pity,
since a suitably placed gesture of the arm
could easily have provided his speech with the
odd graceful flourish.
Judging from his speech, Flowers is an
angry man: he dealt with M r s T's government,
A pathetic wretch falls prostrate before the King (Sir Henry Fisher).
Angel of Death? IRA terrorism as portrayed in Angel'.
Angel, written and directed by Neil
Jordan, cert AA, opening at the Scala and
Paris Pullman on November 4.
When saxophonist Danny witnesses the
murder of his band's manager and a deaf girl
he met at the gig, he is doomed to follow a
Deafhiw'sh-like trail of revenge and murder to
kill the IRA gang responsible.
His response is not immediate but once he
has acquired the gang's gun and killed its
owner he sets about his task in earnest.
Obviously this plot is very serious but the
film totally fails to convey this through weak
acting and a loose narrative the only salient
point made is the anonymity and normality of
the murder gang in the fabric of society, other
comment on the Irish problem is non-existent.
A non-Irish audience will find even less in the
film (who is Dickie Rock? What is the Soldier's
Song?) but some may recognise the high-
ranking J e w i s h police officer B l o o m from
Joyce's Ulysses.
Angel was made by the Motion Picture
Company of Ireland for the big screen but will
shortly be shown on Channel 4. However
previous B B C productions about Northern
Ireland My Dear Palestrina and Shadows On
Our Skin (whose star makes an appearance in
Angel as a faith-healer) are m u c h more
informed, relevant and also entertaining than
Angel.

tyranny, the triumph of the individual over the
state, and the deplorable increase in the price
of sausages. He is clearly a man with a mission,
but his speech fell short of an outright
condemnation of the human race. But, the
length! Even Hitler never spoke so long.
M r S t e p h e n G o u l d e r then rose in his
capacity as the 'Student Orator' and delivered
a fine verbal display. This is a remarkable feat,
considering M r Goulder's speech impediment.
It is not widely known that an unfortunate
incident befell M r Goulder over the summer
when he was mauled by a savage beast lurking
in the depths of Hyde Park whilst on his way
home. (It is believed that he was mistaken for a
bear in the evening light, and let's face it, this
does seem a likely hypothesis in view of M r
Goulder's appearance). The extent of the
damage was such that M r Goulder was rushed
off to the Intensive Care Unit at London Zoo,
and his remarkable recovery bears testimony
to the genuis of the N H S . But as Voltaire's
Professor Pangloss would say, all bad things
result in something good, and the good side of
•the incident was that Dr Tony Haines was
given a remarkable opportunity of writing fives
papers on a most unusual topic. This was the
real reason for D r H a i n e s ' p r o m o t i o n to
Whitehall. There, one learns something new
every day, doesn't one? Now, where was I?
A h , yes! The Prisoners!
The stage thronged with prisoners (newly

elected graduates) rounded up after the war
(waged by those in the procession)- A n d such
a pitiful sight they looked, dressed as they
were in black sackcloth with heads hung low.
E a c h was s u m m o n e d to the sinister king
(played by Sir Henry Fisher) to be condemned
to death. The incredibly evil High Priest (Brian
Flowers) presided over this whole wretched
business. I shall never forget the hideous smile
on the King as the prisoners were condemned
and the tragic indifference written across the
face of the High Priest. Truly, these characters
must represent the most evil creations of our
time. The imminence of all these deaths was
represented, at the end of the scene, by' a choir
of the angelic host.
The Grand Inquisitor next struck upon the
proceedings. Played by Professor John Albery
(and described as the 'Staff Orator' in the
programme notes), the man was clearly out of
his depth. It is sad to see a great actor taking
on a tragic role for which he is not suited. Prof
Albery is much better at light farce. The Grand

Priest.
Yesterday's performance of Commemor-
ation Day did not feature the 'Special Visitor'
(always described as such in the programme
notes but who represents, of course, the
Glorified Being (ie a god)). However in past
performances this character was always
unconvincing and, at worst, confusing. The
Glorified Being, having miraculously appeared,
was meant to impart advice to the wretched
prisoners for the Hereafter, but always acted
and behaved like an ordinary mortal. This has
always been the fault of the director, John
S m i t h , w h o b e l i e v e s , n a i v e l y , that s u c h
simplistic ideas would fool a British audience. If
he were only to take the obvious course and
stand the character primly on a richly ornate
pedestal (in the Baroque style), or to herald his
arrival at the podium with a trumpet fanfare,
then there would never be any misunder-
standing. The absence of the Glorified Being
yesterday made a very welcome break from
tradition, and one can only hope that Smith
doesn't choose to revive this dreadful creation
next season.
The end of this epic drama was rounded off
in a g r a n d m a n n e r . W i t h the m a n i a c a l
rantings on the organ signifying the anguish
of the souls in purgatory, the prisoners
symbolically descended to the c a t a c o m b s
below the Royal Albert Hall. All in all this was
an excellent performance, firmly reasserting
the work's place in the mainstream of British
pompous drama.
Student Standbys will be available next year
at a price of 2V2 p.
