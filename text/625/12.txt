Volleyball
The Volleyball C l u b has begun
the year on the right foot, with a
fair number of interested (and
interesting!) people turning up
to our practise sessions. O u r a i m
this year is to put up two men's
teams and a ladies' team, and we
n e e d a few m o r e p e o p l e t o
achieve that—so if you're at all
handy at j u m p i n g and hitting
( a h , so y o u h a d a y o u n g e r
brother, too!), or if you're just
curious, come along to a session
o n W e d n e s d a y o r S a t u r d a y
afternoons (both beginning at
1330h).
We also have a special ladies-
only session on Tuesday evenings,
from 1730 to 1900 or so, when
the net is at the correct height for
women (ie eight inches lower
than for men!), which makes
things a lot easier.
A l l sessions are in the Volley-
ball Court on the second floor of
the o l d C h e m i s t r y B u i l d i n g
behind Biochemistry (follow the
signs up the iron staircase).

Q Sailing
The Imperial team began the
season u n a u s p i c i o u s l y at the
Castaway's ' F o o t ' T r o p h y .
Twenty teams from around
the country assembled in a foggy
force zero at the weekend to sail
f o r the t r o p h y . I C m a d e a
hopeful start beating Castaways
second team (just) arriving at the
finish line ahead of some people
who, in previous years, have
sailed not only in the University
First team but also the British
Universities team. However, not
s u r p r i s i n g l y , c o n s i d e r i n g the
greater experience and speed of
many of the teams, I C d i d not
continue to win but were often
found team raching each other
with the opposition some (con-
siderable) distance in front in an
unassailable position.
It's an old, old story of 'The
Foot'. A l l the other club teams
have been sailing all summer and
are well in practice, whereas the
Imperial team had been formed
on the previous Wednesday and
never s a i l e d t o g e t h e r before
Saturday. A l l we could hope to
do was beat the other university
teams present—this we (almost)
did beating Cambridge and U L

panic and hope for the future.
Incidentally, U L 1 were los-
ing semi-finalists. U L 2 would
have lost to I C had the two met.
Both U L teams consisted mainly
o f I C p e o p l e — w h i c h s e e m s
crazy but there it is. The trophy
was w o n by C a s t a w a y s first
team.
Team: Graham, Graham, Pete,
Dave, Julian, Jim, Richard, Mike.
Snooker
The A team has made a slow
start in their first season in the
L o n d o n S h i p p i n g C o m p a n i e s
l e a g u e . T h e y w e r e n a r r o w l y

m o r e l u c k a n d s l i g h t l y less
alcohol consumption it could
have been a d i f f e r e n t s t o r y .
T h o m a s o n was p a r t i c u l a r l y
unlucky when he accidentally
conceded his frame. The stan-
dard of play in this league is
clearly much higher than the
U L U league which was d o m -
inated by I C last year, but the
team is confident that they will
win the title.
T h e r e w i l l be a p o t - l u c k
d o u b l e s t o u r n a m e n t i n t h e
coming weeks which is open to
all club members (if you are not
a member yet, bring £1 to the
Snooker R o o m any lunchtime).
Details of all tournament, and
matches, will be on the Snooker
C l u b noticeboard.
Cross Country
Richmond Park
The third race of the season was
our own I C friendly at R i c h m o n d
P a r k a n d a f t e r l a s t y e a r ' s
disaster (when only one person
went the right way due to a lack
of markers) it was hoped that
this year w o u l d be more success-
ful. The race was due off at
3 : 0 0 p m b u t by t e n p a s t the
captain (who was the only one
who knew the course) had still
n o t t u r n e d u p . T h e r e w e r e
visions of last year repeating
itself until the captain, attired in
a rather grotty tracksuit and
riding what looked to be his
granny's bone-shaker appeared
over the hill. Eventually the race
got underway (in the traditional
rain shower) with H u g h D i x o n
finishing fourth and newcomer
T i m Scott doing well in seventh
place. A large I C contingent
ensured our first team of second
place and a good time was had
by all (except the captain who
almost has his beard shaved).
A training schedule has been
put up on the cross country
noticeboard so if you want to get
fit to race, or even for fun, why
not turn up and train with other
people—it's much more enjoy-
able than on your own.
Southampton
C l u b members gained their first
m e d a l success of the season
competing for L o n d o n Univer-
sity at Southampton on Oct 23.
Over the five miles course of
quite muddy woodland tracks
we finished third team out of
seventeen (IC had three members
of the five man team). H u g h
D i x o n ran well to finish sixteenth
with G r a h a m H a r k e r finishing
t h i r t y - f o u r t h . T h e t e a m was
c o m p l e t e d b y J e f f H u d s o n
finishing thirteenth in his first
run for I C .
Squash
First the bad news. The first and
third teams both lost whilst the
f o u r t h t e a m o n l y w o n by a
walkover.
The good is that H o w a r d Bills
and Laaeque Daneshmend have
recently been selected for the
U L U first team.
M e m b e r s h i p has s o a r e d to
approximately 140, and better
still is that temporary ladders
have been put up at last which
should open up lines of c o m m u n
should open lines of c o m m u n i -
c a t i o n b e t w e e n p r e v i o u s l y
unacquainted players of similar
standing. It is hoped to replace
them in the next three weeks or
so by s o m e o f r a t h e r m o r e
robust construction, A C C funds
willing.
Badminton
Firsts
I C vs Q M C 8-1
O u r 1st pair (Steve and Lee)
started the season well playing
against a Q M C 1st pair which
s h o w e d a lot of a b i l i t y a n d
enthusiasm but not the exped-
ience to overcame the skill and
tactical ability of our players.
However, our 2nd pair, a new
pairing who have not had any
match experience together, were
not so fortunate in that they met
a Q M C 2nd pair which c o m -
bined well in co-ordination and
tactics and who defeated our
pair in two straight sets. After
this i n i t i a l s e t b a c k , the t e a m
settled d o w n to playing to the
s t a n d a r d e x p e c t e d o f the 1st
Division trophy holders and the
game was won quite comfortably
8-1, with the help of a relatively
large group of I C supporters
who watched avidly till the end.
Thanks to all the team who
played.

Tuesdays—team selection based
on these nights. Be there.
Team: S Willis, L Yap, I Bull,
D Demico, I Othman, T Lai.
Ladies
I C vs Q M C 8-1
After forfeiting one game due to
the n o n - a p p e a r a n c e of t h e i r
captain and a second pair player
in the first half-hour of play,
Q M C proceded to lose game
after game. IC's first pair, A n d r e
a n d S u e , p l a y e d w i t h c o m -
manding authority conceding a
total of only nineteen points in
six games. Jane and D o t fol-
lowed their team-mate's initia-
tive and won both their matches
convincingly. M i r a n d a and A n n
after defeating Q M C ' s first and
third pair were perhaps unfor-
t u n a t e i n l o s i n g t o Q M C ' s
second p a i r — b u t all in a l l a
thoroughly satisfying morning's
play by I C .
Team: A Rickard, S Newton
(first pair), J Radford, D Payne
(second pair), M Bellchambers, A
Lister (3rd pair).
Lacrosse
L a d i e s l a c r o s s e is a s p o r t
conspicuous by its absence at I C .
H o w e v e r by l o o k i n g a little
further afield it is possible to
play for a team or alternatively
just for fun. This can be accom-
plished by turning up at the
U L U G y m in Malet Street at
2 : 0 0 p m o n W e d n e s d a y a f t e r -
n o o n s . H e r e y o u w i l l f i n d
( h o p e f u l l y ) the U L U l a d i e s
lacrosse club training hard (?).
The club medt every Wednes-
d a y a n d p l a y m a t c h e s m o s t
Saturdays. In past seasons the
teams have done very well and
seasons have included tours to
such places as the U S A .
