L uckily, the first three weeks of
term have passed without any
fatalities on the range, although
murder has been in most peoples
hiinds on occasions. When Tim
Higgs is down the range, however,
thoughts turn to admiration at
the shooting ability of this
mature second year chemist.
L a s t Wednesday he demon-
strated the '3 point' shooting
position to several new members
who were held spellbound by
T i m ' s technique. H o p e f u l l y ,
Wednesday's match against
Middlesex Hospitals will give
him a chance to really show
himself up.
New shooters are still required
for team selection, so if anyone
can average ninety or more, he
or she may be able to shoot for
IC sometime during the year.
Even if your average isn't that
high we have an internal knock-
out competition, contact Mark
Bourke for details. Indeed, at
ICRPC we have something for
everyone, but if Tim or the other
range officers can't help you,
just try Steve Harrison (Club
Captain, contact via Elec Eng
letter-racks), he will know the
answer to your problems.

What a messy start to the season
this is proving to be for Imperial.
Playing one of the few teams we
struggled against last season,
Imperial once again found it
hard to penetrate a skilful and
•confident Barts side. It was only
through some sharp defensive
work by sweeper Andy Stewart

and keeper Chris Jones that
prevented some promising Barts
attacks being converted to goals.
However, by half-time Barts
were a deserved goal up from
one of their numerous corner
one of their numerous short
corners.
Half-time was to provide little
change to Imperial's waning
enthusiasm (after all, we are the
best college team in London—
ain't we!) and we were soon two
goals down.
However, with about ten
minutes to go Mangat Bansal
flicked the ball over a prostrate
goalie which seemed to provide
the incentive we needed. Within
a few minutes skipper Ayres
completed a good solo run with
a nicely finished goal...then
proceded to miss two sitters. Ah
well...we were lucky! "Is it really
worth playing?"...is this really
the College first team?

IC vs Surrey 10-2
After many hours of travelling
and a short stop at a waterhole
our twelve brave men arrived at
Guildford in their vain search
for the all-knowing all-eating
ostrich that is known to frequent
those desolate parts.
However, having not yet
recovered f r o m the jet leg
provided by Rodger's driving we
were confronted by a hoard
painted blue and white primarily
sent to distract from our mission.
The battle commenced with
initial confusion allowing us to
both inflict and sustain injuries
of a twofold nature; this dead-
lock being ruptured shortly
before a tactical retreat allowed
us to regroup before our final
surge. At this point our leader
Whitehead made a brilliant
decision that entirely changed
the course of the battle: that is,
substituted himself.
The second battle ensued and
these barbarians were overawed
by the skill of Gammy Pencil
and Paul De Doo Doo Doo De
Daa Daa Daa Bonnet and seven
more successful s k i r m i s h e s
finally brought them to their
knees.
The battle over and still
lacking both liquid and solid
sustenance the evening found
our fearless few still searching
for this mythical beast and
pondering over the meaning of
life.
