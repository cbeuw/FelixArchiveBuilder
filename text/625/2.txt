IC Council
Sir
I would like to correct the
inaccurate description of the
House Committee given by Nick
Pyne in last week's F E L I X . The
partition that used to be in the
Lower Lounge was ordered by
Barney M c C a b e without any
approval by House Committee.
I would also disagree with
Nick's comment that House
C o m m i t t e e spend a lot of
money. This year it has been
alloted only £15,000 to cover all
the maintenance of the Union
Building and the replacement of
its equipment. T h e grant is
£5,000 bigger than it was to have
been to cover the costs involved
in the move of the refectory.
Most of the money goes to
repair the damage done by
vandalism and over excited
parties. Considering that it costs
£2,000 just to paint one room it
is amazing that the building is
not in a worse state than it is. I
do agree with Nick though that
it ought to look better. Perhaps
since he is on the PWP he should
suggest that that group recon-
sider the money House Commit-
tee get, after they have dis-
covered the true facts.

Dear Sir
Thanks for the explanation
about IC Council last week—I
had forgotten about it, even
though I am an ex (Dep Rep)
member.
The trouble with Council is
not that it has too many mem-
bers, nor that it drags on for too
l o n g , neither is it b o r i n g .
(Though it has, it does and it is!)
The main probems are (really):
1. It forgets what it is about
(ie managing the Union).
2. It is (often) weakly chaired.
3. It does not work to a
timetable.
4. It is (always) full of prats
more interested in politics than
in dojng the jobs for which they
..were elected, who use their ex
P o g e 2
officio positions on Council to
expose their narrow mindedness.
Much of the problem lies in
the duplication of effort between
C C U s and I C U (look at the
world of academic affairs). That
is another topic.
Yours, believing that nothing ever
changes

Lust and
Pornography
Dear FELIX
After my first day at Imperial
I was not impressed (nearer
violently sick) perhaps it was the
silly jokes of the Union officials
or perhaps it was a little white
booklet called ...but afraid to
ask. O p e n i n g this b o o k , I
expected a student's eye view of
IC before my eyes, but found a
student's eye view of sex. While I
am not naive enough to think
by pretending it does not happen
it will not happen, and I do not
ask that all IC should observe
my moral code, all I ask that all
IC should not impose its moral
code onto me! (Note the first
page of the pamphlet which
implied that it was essential
r e a d i n g for freshers). T h i s
pamphlet all but ignored the
alternative philosophy to sex put
forward by a number of religious
and non-religious phycologists.
What treatment that was given
of this alternative was the
implication that no real people
believe this, I assure you there
are.
I would like to comment on
the implication that the safe
p e r i o d was the m e t h o d o f
contraception for Catholics. I do
not i n t e n d to put f o r w a r d
arguments for or against contra-
ception but only to say that the
church has told us that it's use is
extremely damaging to one's
spiritual life and so are not to be
used. The use of contraceptives
as with murder is a matter of
conscience but is damaging to
the user and therefore a wrong.
My third point concerns the first
Guildsheet cover and the H G
Wells Society poster. I agreed
the lusting for the body in it's
own right is dehumanising. If
women are treated inhumanely
not just in this way but in
explicit pornography also (the
principle's the same) then is it
not suprising (and I put this as a
question) that in some cases
where women are held in very
low regard by men, rape and
sexual assault.

Dear Martin,
Well, I seem to have come in for
quite a lot of stick in this week's
F E L I X . Whilst I don't give a
damn about most of it, I feel that
I must reply to the letter from
our dear friend Mark Alderton.
I'm sorry, but I just don't accept
that in "...but were afraid to
ask" we were trying to impose
any moral code on anyone. I can
accept that anyone with such a
sheltered upbringing as Mark
has obviously had might find
some of the material shocking,
but if he could only overcome
his inhibitions and actually read
the material, he might find that
far from taking any moral
standpoint, that the publication
aims to give factual information.
Whilst Mark may feel that, when
the time comes (doubtless after
H o l y wedlock), that all will
come naturally. W e l l , I am
afraid to say that it doesn't, and
neglect of such information can
lead to a lot of hardship for all
involved.
Really Mark, isn't it time that
you grew up and faced the world
as it is? You can't bury your
head and pretend that it doesn't
happen for the rest of your life!
Yours etc.

Southside Cafe
Sir
I wish to complain, not about
the f o o d i n the S o u t h s i d e
Refectory (not yet) but of some
of the people who use it.
It would appear to be an open
house for every builders labour-
er in the area. Not only do they
come into the refectory in dirty
overalls, but more often smoth-
ered in cement etc; but it would
appear that you are open to
abuse if you ask them not to rub
against your clothes, and like
most people, I like a bit of
builders dust on my food, it's an
aid to digestion.
If the powers that be want a
workman's cafe to operate in
Southside, then I would suggest
that they open a refectory
somewhere for students.
Yours sincerely

News Reporting
Dear Sir
A news item appeared in
F E L I X last week, on the back
page, entitled "Debsoc Comes
Out". This item did not appear
on the letters page or the
editorial or reviews, it was
plainly news. Yet on reading the
[October 29,19821
story one not only finds several
minor and excusable mistakes
but one discovers the opinion of
the writer.
The anonymous contributor
uses rhetorical language to
support the opposers of the
motion "This House believes
Multilateralists live in a Dream
World".
Mr Curry was the best speaker,
but to go so far as to say his
metaphors were charming and
that they complemented solid
arguments by M r Sketch exceeds
the boundaries of news reporting.
You may argue that the bound-
aries are very hazy and I will
agree. Even so, here they were
definitely over-reached. Y o u
may argue that news is bound to
include opinions of the reporters,
if it is to such an extent as to
distort the event being described
I believe the reporter has failed
in his/her task. In this particular
case no mention whatsoever was
given of the argument of the
proposer, the reader is not even
told if indeed they had one.
If the F E L I X staff recognises
what it prints as opinionated it
should either give alternative
views of the same event or state
in each issue that the news is not
news but the opinions of its
writers.

Miscellany at Large
Dear Editor
Bravo! A rare triumph of art
over the harsh utilitarianism of
Imperial. Scorning the over-
worn cliches of white squares to
write in, the F E L I X calendar
explores exciting new reaches of
illegibility as the proud owner
tries to compress more and more
information into a smaller and
smaller white triangle as term
progresses. Surely a poignant
metaphor of student life.

Dear Mr Taylor

to learn that we sold an extremely
encouraging number of Life Sci

Dear Martin S Taylor,
Why is it that the Letters to the
Editor always take up exactly
one page, and there is never a
small gap left at the foot of the
last column?
Yours sincerely
