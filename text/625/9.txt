Mara Hari by Chris Judge Smith, Lene
Lovich and Les Chappell, directed by
Hilary Westlake, Lyric Studio Theatre,
Hammersmith.
Who remembers the T V interview in those
heady new wave days when Lene Lovich said
she would like to experiment with some music
theatre work in the future? Well, here she is,
appearing in Mata Han (a musical in which she
has the leading role) in the studio theatre of a
shredded wheat box known as the Lyric,
Hammersmith.
Such a venture for a pop music performer
one would expect to be a mere ego trip. Not so
with Lene, she seems to be in her natural
habitat in this production! However, 'slick' isn't
a word I'd use to describe the show. After the
first five minutes or so (which one spends in
Top of the Pops fashion—working out that
she's not actually miming) it becomes obvious
that the mixing and sound are all wrong. The
synthesiser music drowns out Lovich's voice.
Margaretha Geertuida Zelle (alias Mata
Hari) was a famous dancer at the beginning of
this century. Despite her Dutch origin she
convinced the whole of Europe that she was
Indian and that her exotic nude performances
Dr Neil Harris, one of IC's Careers Advisers
and Alistair Kirk (Chairman, Industrial
Society) introduce the
Imperial College Careers Fair
Date: next Wednesday, November 3
Place: Junior Common Room
Time: 9:30am — 1:00pm and 2:00pm —
5:30pm
Designed for final-year students, but others
welcome.
Meeting Employers
There are already several ways for IC students
to meet employers. There's the formal
Graduate Recruitment Programme, when 250
firms hold 'Milkround' interviews. Then there
are presentations by firms, and old student
associations careers evenings. Less formally,
the Industrial Society has arranged eight visits
to companies this term.
The Need for a Careers Fair
However, none of these enables you to make
direct comparisons between firms in one day.
So, the Industrial Society and the Careers
Advisory Service have organised the first IC
Careers Fair.
The Fair
The Careers Fair isn't part of a selection
process by the sixty firms attending. The sole
purpose is to help final year students find out
about job vacancies in 1983. You should also
be able to penetrate the 'public relations' gloss
which covers some recruitment brochures.
Each firm is attending only one session.
Either morning (9:30am to 1:00pm) or
afternoon (2:00 to 5:30pm). The College's
Careers Advisers will also be there to give
advice.
The following firms haven't yet decided
when they're coming: Berger Paints, Cargill
(UK), Ego Computers, London Fire Brigade,
Marconi Communication Systems, Mars
Limited, Royal Navy.
Company Reps
Two types of company representatives will
attend the Fair. The Graduate Recruitment
M A T A H A R I
How much thought do you give to a future
career?
Managers will let you know where you could fit
into their firms. Interrogate them while you've
got the chance!
•How much money will I get?
•Will my performance be reviewed regularly,
and will it be linked to rewards?
•What if I don't want to do research work?
•Can I specialise in one area?
These are some questions you could ask
them. However, do be a little tactful with some
of the reps, especially Mr John Longenderfer—
he's the Vice President of Lutron Electronics,
and he's flying in from America specially to
meet you.
The second type of company reps are the
ex-IC students. They joined their firms about
three years ago—grill them, too:
•What does your work involve?
•How relevant is my degree subject?
•How good is the firm at recognising talent?
Conclusion
Although the Careers Fair is designed for final
year students seeking jobs, it will also help
other students.
Whatever stage you've reched in your ideas
about careers, go to the Fair and tell us how
helpful it's been to you. We'll then be able to
improve it ready for next year.
were authentic Hindu religious dances. Mata
Hari was equally renowned for her mysterious
and scandalous private life. She had numerous
wealthy and powerful lovers.
Somehow Mata Hari became involved with
the German Secret Service at the outbreak of
the First World War. O n returning to Paris
from Berlin she was recruited as a double
agent by the French, but later was arrested by
them and shot as a German spy.
The production at the Lyric is based on this
story and co-authored by Lovich, Les Chapell
(who did the Stiff records with Lene) and Chris
Judge Smith (of Van Der Graff Generator
fame). It is an experimental form of music
theatre and should therefore be encouraged.
However, one suspects that without the
special talent and charisma of Ms Lovich it
would probably flop.
The musical continues until November 13,
so ask your granny who Mata Hari was, then
take the tube to Hammersmith and find out
yourself.
