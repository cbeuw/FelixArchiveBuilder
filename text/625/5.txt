It is probably a good thing that
M a r y Freeman has resigned as
H o n o r a r y S e c r e t a r y ; her u n -
popularity in the U n i o n Office
was making it impossible for the
U n i o n to run smoothly and there
were several important deadlines
she failed to meet.
But the circumstances which
l e d t o her r e s i g n a t i o n , a n d
p a r t i c u l a r l y the n a t u r e a n d
source o f much of the criticism
levelled at her give some cause
for concern. M a r y was attacked
as lazy, ineffectual and having
no real concept of the H o n See's
job. None of these criticisms is
directly valid. H e r main fault
(albeit a serious one, and one
which cannot be condoned) is
that she had no sense of priority
in her work; little jobs which
should have been brushed aside
were dealt with in such pernickety
detail that larger, more important
issues were left untouched, and
work which kept her in the office
late into the evening prevented
her from dealing with urgent
enquiries at 9:30 in the morning.
Y e t h o w were these faults
dealt with? Surely the correct
p r o c e d u r e w o u l d be f o r the
President to ask M a r y into his
office for what is k n o w n euphe-
mistically as 'a quiet w o r d ' or,
more seriously, a 'formal repri-
m a n d ' . T h i s was n o t d o n e .
Instead, the only criticism M a r y
received was in the form of snide
c o m m e n t s f r o m the A c t i n g
D e p u t y P r e s i d e n t C h r i s t i n e
Teller and pompous noises from
Stephen. Such attacks are rarely
made d i r e c t l y t o the p e r s o n
concerned, and so M a r y was left
to pick up purely negative, non-
constructive criticism from the
grapevine o f U n i o n hacks who
hang around the U n i o n Office—
i n c l u d i n g , a s t o n i s h i n g l y , the
EDITORIAL
U n i o n permanent staff, who are
s u p p o s e d t o b e b e l o w the
H o n o r a r y Secretary and should
certainly k n o w their position
better than this. Neither was the
criticism restrained to factual
failings, and people who ought
to be m o r e r e s p o n s i b l e were
h a p p y t o m i n g l e c r u e l j o k e s
about M a r y ' s private life with
serious criticism, and, moreover,
without restricting the gossip to
other U n i o n hacks alone.
W h y have the U n i o n been so
unhelpful? The reason is found
in the first words o f Christine
T e l l e r ' s speech at T u e s d a y ' s
U G M : " I never liked M a r y from
the s t a r t . " It is because the
U n i o n have allowed their per-
sonal feelings against M a r y to
influence the way they treated
her in her job that undoubted
failings were exacerbated.
One final example of Stephen
Goulder's unkindness: O n the
F r i d a y a f t e r n o o n a f t e r h e r
resignation M a r y was relaxing
with some friends in the Dramsoc
store. She had kept the keys to
her office to enable her to tidy
up over the weekend, and leave a
n o t e f o r t h e n e w H o n S e c
describing the jobs which were
or weren't finished, the contents
of the files, and so on and so
forth. Stephen then arrived at
the d o o r a n d sent i n J o h n
M c C a l l i o n ( w h o h a d at that
stage b e e n D P f o r j u s t ten
minutes) as a kind of baliff, to
demand the return of the keys.
When M a r y refused, Stephen
himself entered, took the keys,
and with a whirl o f pompous
i n s u l t s a n d s n i d e c o m m e n t s
a b o u t M a r y ' s i n c o m p e t e n c e ,
stormed off.
N o , M a r y was not a good
H o n o r a r y Secretary, but did she
have to be forced out so u n -
p l e a s a n t l y ? I n her l e t t e r o f
r e s i g n a t i o n she c o m p l a i n e d
about a lack o f compassion in
the U n i o n ; j u d g i n g f r o m the
reaction since she left, she seems
to have been right.
Mascotry
Mascotry is one o f the great
traditions of L o n d o n University,
and of Imperial College with its
three C C U s i n p a r t i c u l a r . I t
provides a lot of fun, excitement
and a challenge to the skills of
the various U n i o n personnel and
raises a large amount of money
for charity at the same time.
T w o weeks ago, R C S U made
an attempt to steal Spanner and
Bolt from the Elec E n g Freshers'
dinner. The attempt was beaten
o f f (by P r o f e s s o r A n d e r s o n ,
amongst others, as reported last
week) but apart from getting a
l i t t l e t o o v i o l e n t i t w a s a
reasonable attempt at a mascot
raid, and well within the spirit
and rules of rriascotry.
But since then, R C S U have
been turning up in small numbers
to act as a 'worrying party' at
subsequent freshers' d i n n e r s .
The numbers involved are so
small that no serious attempt at
theft is intended; the intruders
are merely there to 'worry' the
G u i l d s m e n o r g a n i s i n g t h e
dinner. Is there any purpose to
this? It seems that the only thing
it achieves is to prevent G u i l d s -
m e n f r o m a t t e n d i n g t o the
business in hand (ie welcoming
freshers and enjoying a relaxed
meal in a social atmosphere) and
a n n o y i n g t h e v i s i t i n g s t a f f
members. In fact, several c o m -
p l a i n t s h a v e b e e n m a d e b y
engineering lecturers about the
worrying parties.
If a serious raid is intended,
t h e n w e l l a n d g o o d , b u t J o
provide small groups of pickets
to hang around the door of the
r e f e c t o r y i s j u s t w h a t i t i s
intended t o be—a pain in the
neck.

began " O n hearing the fire bell,
