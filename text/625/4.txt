Mary: Who's to Blame?
Last Friday Union Honorary Secretary Mary Freeman resigned
after receiving an 'insulting' memo from President Stephen
Goulder. Mr Goulder has subsequently published the memo
which is reproduced below together with his report which was
referred back at Tuesday's UGM, and Mary Freeman's reaction
to the whole affair.

Freeman resigned on Friday
as from 12:45 that day.
The circumstances behind
.her resignation stretch back

sabbaticals started. By the

was such that in my view she

9
Reasons for my
Resignation
Dear Martin
I am writing this letter in
order to clear up any mistaken
impressions that might surround
my resignation.
T h e m a i n reason for my
resignation was the letter that
Steve sent me regarding the non-
appearance of Exec News in last
week's F E L I X and instructing
me to be in the office by 10:00am
in future. The latter request
might seem reasonable, if you do
not take into account the reason
for my arrival at times after this
was due to the fact that the
previous night I would have
been working in the office until
gone 11:00pm O K , so Marco
and Liz may have managed this,
but was it for every single night
(bar two: Friday 15 when I went
to the Life Sci dinner and last
Thursday) for two and a half
weeks?
It was obvious from the start
of my sabbatical post that 1 was
not well liked by Steve and
Christine amongst others, but I
had hoped that this would not
interfere with my capability of
doing my job.
As regards my job. 1 felt that I
and previous Hon Sees alone
were qualified to know what the
job entailed (yes my habit of
reading sections of the Blue
Book did include my job des-
cription). Is it surprising then
that I felt insulted when Steve
said that I was not doing my job?
"Surely," you ask, "he must
have had reasons for thinking
that you were not?" "Yes," I
answer, "but that does not mean
he can reason correctly."
There are three 'reasons' that I
can come up with.
The non-appearance of Exec
News
Steve handed me his article for
this M o n d a y (after Pat, the
typist, had gone home). That
evening and the f o l l o w i n g
morning I was preparing papers
for Council on the Tuesday
evening writing up and pro-
ducing U F C minutes. On Tues-
day evening I had C o u n c i l
(which finished at 8:30) and I
then wrote and typed up the
H o n o r a r y S e c r e t a r y ' s a n d
Returning Officers's reports for
Exec News and pasted up the
minutes and papers of the
p r e v i o u s C o u n c i l into the
Minute Book. I finished this
somewhere between 1:00 and
2:00am and by this time the
F E L I X Office was empty. I thus
gave the papers to you on the
Wednesday morning as soon as I
came in. You complained at the
time that the deadline was
5:30pm Monday, and I gave you
the reasons why it could not
have been in by then. I also
reminded you that it is part of
the F E L I X Editor's job descrip-
tion to "produce a supplement
to F E L I X in the issue prior to
each U G M , c o n t a i n i n g all
minutes, reports, motions and
all matters to be discussed at the
U G M . " (I obviously did not
quote this in full, I just use it to
illustrate how badly thought out
some JDs are—reproducing the
minutes would mean an extra
page at least in each F E L I X ) .
That the Union Directory was not
produced for the start of term
Firstly, my job description says
"at the start of the session".
Secondly, last year was the first
time in several years that it was
produced for the start of session.
T h i r d l y , it was ready for
printing in the form that Mark
Smith suggested that I paste it
up in two weeks before the start
of session. (Unfortunately his
' idea to paste up the typed sheets
and reduce it onto the plate
instead of reducing it first,
pasting it up and making the
plate normally, did not work. So
I was left the week before term
started with twenty sheets to
reduce from A3 to A4 and to
then paste up. I succeeded in
reducing half of these sheets).
Publicising the U G M
a) This is the Publicity Offi-
cer's job (though I am "res-
ponsible for (v) all Union
publicity, overall, ").
b) A Publicity Officer was not
elected last term (no-one stood
for the post and, because the
first Summer U G M last year was
inqourate, no nominations were
taken at the U G M ) .
c) I told Steve that I doubted
that I would have time to do the
poster at the Wednesday Exec
meeting.
d) Steve arrives at the office
around 9:00am, leaves around
5:30/6:30pm has worked on
F E L I X (else why would he be
Chairman of the F E L I X Club
and go down there at 3:00pm
each day for a cup of tea) and
has evenings off.
If anyone else knows of any
other reasons why Steve thinks
that I was not doing my job I
would like to know (but you will
have to hurry, I am "allowed the
use of (this) room until the end
of the month"). I would also like
to know why he (via first
C h r i s t i n e a n d then J o h n
McCallion (whom I wish the
best of luck in his new job as
DP)) was in such a hurry to get
my Union Office keys back on
Friday evening after I had said
that I would need doing over the
next couple of weeks over the
weekend (which) would be the
only time I had free, since I
would be job and flat hunting
during his office hours), but
then I suppose he thought that I
would do what he would do in
my situation and do something
as childish as destory some
papers or whatever. A s he
refused my offer to help out, I
presume he will now need
someone to help in the office
sorting out what needs doing. So
if anyone has some spare time, I
think Steve will (by the time you
are reading this) be grateful of
the help.
Yours sincerely
