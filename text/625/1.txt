NO FLOWERS BY REQUEST
Ex-Honorary Secretary Mary Freeman will hot receive a vote of \
thanks from the Union. A motion instructing the Union Executive to
send her twenty red roses as a token of appreciation was heavily
defeated at Tuesday's Union General Meeting.
The controversy began when blame for the non-appearance of
C o l i n C o o p e r o b j e c t e d to
President Stephen Goulder's
report, on the grounds of factual
inaccuracy over whether the
H o n o r a r y Secretary was to
Anti-sexism in action: Peter Burt

sweatshirt.

A vote was taken, and despite a
large number of abstentions a
majority voted to refer the
report to the next U G M .
Ultra Vires
When the motion of Miss
F r e e m a n ' s r e s i g n a t i o n was
reached, the question of whether
buying roses was Ultra Vires
(illegal under the Union Consti-
tuion) was raised by Stephen
Bishop, the C & G U President.
The question was left unresolved
while C o l i n C o o p e r (newly
elected to the Permanent Work-
ing Party) proposed the motion,
which expressed regrets at the
circumstances of Miss Freeman's
resignation, thanked her for her
work in the Union and ordered
the Union to buy her the roses.
The motion went unopposed
until Christine Teller, last year's
acting Deputy President, ad-
dressed the meeting. She said
that she had never liked Miss
Freeman, who had at no time
understood the Hon See's job.
Bitching Session
Mr Cooper replied that as the
meeting had now degenerated
into a 'bitching session', he
c o u l d p o i n t out that M i s s
Freeman had frequently worked
far later into the night than the
rest of the Union staff, and that
her job was made very difficult
for her by the dislike that the
Union staff showed her.
Mr Goulder then briefly lost
his temper while trying to submit
information out of turn. When
Nick Pyne, the Chairman, had
silenced him, Jen Hardy-Smith
continued on back page
is
The Rector delivered a cautiously optimistic speech at Commemoration
Day yesterday. In his address in the Albert Hall, he outlined the
difficulties that Imperial and the University of London had suffered in
the last year, but welcomed what he saw as a more rational approach by
the government after their earlier 'blind prejudice' against further
education.
DP: McCallion
Takes Over
John McCallion, a third year
mathematics student, was elected
Union Deputy President last
week. He takes the post left open
when Deputy President-elect Phil
Greenstreet failed his final exams
last summer.
Last year M r McCallion was
appointed Rag Treasurer and
successfully resolved some of the
convoluted legal and financial
difficulties left by successive Rag
committees. He will not be
working as a full-time salaried
sabbatical officer, but he will be
available three afternoons a
week in the Union Office.
