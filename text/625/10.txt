Christmas is coming up folks, which might
have cheerful prospects for some but for the
homeless it can be quite a dismal time. Crisis at
Christmas is an organisation which tries to
help these people in London. This year they
n e e d v o l u n t e e r s to go on a s p o n s o r e d
pilgrimage from Canterbury to London on
December 4 and 5. Also needed are people to
stand at checkpoints. Over the Christmas
period there is a crisis centre which provides
s h e l t e r a n d f o o d for h o m e l e s s p e o p l e .
Volunteers are needed for eight hour periods
of helping at the centre, help to set it up and
clear up and also drivers over the age of
twenty-five with or without a car. If you could
possibly help with any of the above please
c o m e to the C o m m u n i t y A c t i o n G r o u p
meeting every Monday, 12:30 in the Rag Office
(next to Snooker) or contact Rebecca May,
Physics 3.

Apologies to the masses who thronged Beit
Q u a d last Friday, desperately looking for the
Flicker but my e x c u s e , t h o u g h h a r d to
stomach, was accurate—London Co-op had
indeed provided us with two soundtracks and
no film.
This week it will be different! For one thing
we will be in ME220 again and for another we
are getting the film from a somewhat more
reliable if mundane source: Rank Film Hire.
The film is Network-a superb satire on the
American media. Peter Finch plays a T V
anchorman who on learning he is to be sacked
due to falling ratings has a breakdown. The T V
company still allow him to make one last show
and then the film starts.
S o tonight at 8:30 in M E 2 2 0 is w h e r e
everyone's gonna be (I hope). It's free to
members and an incredibly cheap 50p to non-
members.
All that guff about people wanting to help
or form a film-making branch still applies so
please come along.
In case you think you've been robbed at 30p,
dear members, we have been given a credit by
London Film Co-op and hence will screen
Flicker at a later date.

I refuse to mention — —.
Seeing this epic film reduced to twelve
inches of pitiful black and white scanned
twenty-five times a second down the screen
has destroyed my faith in the T V . But even this
i n h u m a n d e c i m a t i o n c o u l d n ' t soften that
pathetic ending
Though, as my learned friend Phaedius
pointed out the idea of Smiley pulling out his
light sabre and thrusting it between the ribs of
some truculent Russian double agent does
have some limited appeal.
A l l I c a n say i s — T h a n k G o d they are
bumping off L u k e and the fecklee Princess.

H o l i d a y s in A m e r i c a have b e c o m e quite
popular over the last few years, but did you
know you could work there as well to help pay
for it all? W o r k permits aren't easy to get, but
the British Universities North America C l u b
can get one for you.
C & G U organised a very successful Rag M a g
selling trip to Oxford at the weekend with over
four hundred copies of 'Janet and J o h n ' being
sold. Thanks very much to all who came; it
was certainly a very pleasant day. Tonight is of
course the IC Ents Halloween Party in the
J C R . Monday sees the Mechanical Engineering
F r e s h e r s ' D i n n e r , a n d T h u r s d a y the joint
A e r o / D e p a r t m e n t of C o m p u t i n g Freshers'
Dinner at which Jenny Jones will be the guest
speaker. The D o C dinner was postponed
because of poor ticket sales and so D o C
freshers' dinner tickets are valid for the joint
DoC/Aeronautical event. Finally on Friday
N o v e m b e r 5, G u i l d s E n t e r t a i n m e n t s will
present the G u y Fawkes Party in the J C R with
a late bar a n d the b a n d R o m a n H o l i d a y .
Roman Holiday recently appeared at the U L U
Intro Ball, those who saw them there will
undoubtedly wish to see them again.
Thanks to everyone who helped out with the
Paint Y o u r Face disco even though it was
made fairly difficult for us to clear up. Hope
those who attended the Met & Mat Sci dinner
last week enjoyed it and remember the M i n
Res Eng one tonight (6:30pm in the Union
Bar). Anyone who wants to go to Cardiff on
November 13 for some fun and games please
sign up. See you all at the U G M on Tuesday
(12:45pm in G20).
B U N A C is a non-profit making organisation
run for students, by students, which operates
an exchange programme enabling students at
B r i t i s h u n i v e r s i t i e s ( i n c l u d i n g o v e r s e a s
students) to work in the U S A and C a n a d a for
the summer. W e arrange your work permit,
f l i g h t , i n s u r a n c e , a n d f i r s t n i g h t h o t e l
accommodation in America and also have an
office in New Y o r k to give you any help you
might need during your stay in the States.
Y o u have lots of choice in the type of work
you do. Y o u could work as a counsellor on a
k i d s ' s u m m e r c a m p ( B U N A C A M P ) , w o r k
b e h i n d the scenes in the c a m p k i t c h e n s
( K A M P ) , pick tobacco in Ontario, or find
your own job any where you like. (We can help
you with our own job directories, full of jobs
recommended by previous ' B U N A C e r s ' . )
C o m e and find out more at one of our
weekly meetings every Friday lunchtime in the

Celestion will be demonstrating speakers from
throughout their range; both the superlative
SL6s and the budget 110s will be here. They
will be presenting a discussion, illustrated by a
slideshow, in which they will no doubt expand
the virtues of their laser i n t e r f e r o m e t r y
program! C o m e along to the Upper U n i o n

and'listen to the music!

relatively new in the Natural History society
and we have just passed through our first year.
Whereas most outdoor societies exchange the
greyness of London for the equally barren
mountain areas, to us there is an alternative in
the coastal estuaries and marshes which are
teeming with wildlife. Y o u can see all the
variety and excitement of life on the plains o f

opposite F E L I X , to discuss trips this term.
