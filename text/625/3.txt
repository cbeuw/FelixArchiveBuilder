Sex Posters
Banned
Controversy and h u m o u r were
the h a l l m a r k s o f T u e s d a y ' s
U n i o n General Meeting, which
w a s a b l y ( i f e c c e n t r i c a l l y )
c h a i r e d b y N i c k P y n e i n a
turban.
I r o n i c a l l y , i n v i e w o f the
U n i o n President's memo (printed
on page 4) the meeting was easily
q u o r a t e u n t i l the e n d o f the
m o t i o n o n M a r y F r e e m a n ,
which is covered elsewhere. The
other motion to be discussed in
depth was on sexism and had
been left over from the last,
inquorate, U G M .
Sexism
The m o t i o n was proposed by
Susan Watts and Louise N a h o n ,
and expressed concern at the
number of posters i n College
which offend w o m e n .
T w o amendments were passed,
and the motion was carried by
four votes.
The result of this is that if
twenty members of the U n i o n
who find a poster offensive take
a p e t i t i o n t o the H o n o r a r y
S e c r e t a r y or U n i o n P u b l i c i t y
Officer (although both posts are
currently vacant) the complaint
will be considered by the House
Committee. If it is upheld, the
offending society will be fined i n
proportion to the number of
posters displayed.
Elections
M r G o u l d e r (as acting Returning
Officer) announced that papers
for the post of H o n Sec had been
posted on M o n d a y and w o u l d
come d o w n on F r i d a y , N o v e m -
ber 5.
The motion on M a r y Freeman
ended at 2:25 and in face of the
ensuing exodus, M r Pyne a d -
journed the meeting.

Unaccountable
Bar-gains
M a n y members of the U n i o n are
worried by repeated refusals to
p u b l i s h f u l l a c c o u n t s f o r the
College bars, and by moves to
decrease U n i o n influence in the
running of refectories and bars.
I C U President Stephen G o u l d e r
has been accused of not keeping
s t u d e n t s i n f o r m e d o f t h e s e
events.
R o y Francis, the Secretary of
the B a r sub-committee and an
active campaigner for more open
accounts, was removed from the
c o m m i t t e e b y the A c a d e m i c
Staff Assembly which he repre-
sents. H e had been secretary for
four years.
T h e b a r s u b - c o m m i t t e e ' s
terms of reference are at present
to r e p o r t o n b a r p o l i c y a n d
^finance to the Refectory C o m -
mittee and to advise and super-
vise the Refectory Manager's
running of the bars. It comprises
seven members, of w h o m two
are students, and one of these (at
present M r G o u l d e r ) must be
chairman. A new set of terms of
I reference will severely curtail the
I committee's power, and the neSv
chairman will be appointed by
the chairman of the Refectory
Committee, a post currently held
by D r B o b Schroter.
M r G o u l d e r told F E L I X that
he d i d n o t b e l i e v e t h a t t h e
changes w o u l d affect the U n i o n ' s
power on the c o m m i i tee. H e also
said that the full accounts were
n o t m a d e a v a i l a b l e t o t h e
committee because they w o u l d
be open to misinterpretation by
people, who did not understand
them. H e also pointed out that
the bars are all audited at regular
intervals.
A m o t i o n submitted to Tues-
d a y ' s U G M , i n s t r u c t i n g t h e
C o u n c i l to oppose the new terms
of reference was not heard on
Tuesday because the meeting
was adjourned. It is expected to
come up at the next U G M , on
N o v e m b e r 7.
