Quote of the Week
Wordoku 1,446

Well done to The Tough Brets who won last
week’s wordy game. The winning word was
ZOMBIEWAR, as to what one is I have no
clue, but I hoped you enjoyed it not the less.
Tune in next week for more fun and games.

Wordoku is identical to
Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters.
Complete the puzzle and
then send the whole grid to

for just the word alone. It’s not
an anagram.

How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in
a cell and must be surrounded with
a corresponding number of lines.
Lines cannot split and there can
only be one continuous line. Any
cells with no numbers can have any
number of lines. Look at the solu-
tion above for help.

And to the
Vomit Pit!
CharlieMurdoch Coffee Break Editor

A
h bollocks. I had a few com-
plaints last week and I don’t
know what to do about it.
I have been informed that
my personal contribution to the paper
last week was very much below stand-
ard, i.e. shit. I was confused as to why
this could be the case, so after glassing
the complainers I got them to confess.
They informed that they were extreme-
ly disappointed to find that last week I
choose not to have an angry rant direct-
ed at 5000 largely unknown persons. I
can only offer my most sincere apolo-
gies; I just wasn’t that angry last week.
Actually that’s a lie; I did spend most of
last week throwing phones about, but
that’s not my fault. If the twats on the
other end are going to continue to ask
me inane questions that have no bear-
ing on my problem then they are going
to have a phone launched at them. For-
tunately, the closest wall if often much
more appealing to me and my phone is
unusually strong- it’s a Sony Ericsson
for those who are interested.
Right. What would you say if I men-
tioned a Union vomit pit? Run with me
on this. I was supposed to be ‘green’
this week, but I had a little think about
it decided ‘fuck that’. However, down
the bar this week Jov (the ex-editor)
and I came up with an idea so great that
we are going to Dragons’ Den with it- I
shit you not. Listen in boys and girls:
the Union needs to dig a well on the
right hand lawn in the quad. This well
can then be ceremoniously named the
‘Vomit Pit’ and I think you can guess
what it should be used for. If you’ve had
the dreaded one too many, the vomit pit
is there for you and it’s not just laddish
behaviour that can benefit. The bulimic
and anorexic crew out there will ben-
efit hugely too, they can now vomit and
be just like everyone else! ‘Ohh look at
me I’m sooo drunk!’. No love, you just
rammed two fingers down your throat
and it’s 10am. But the best part is that
this pit acts as an anaerobic respirator,
as enzymes break the vomit down en-
ergy is harnessed and the only wasted
product is compost to be used by ESoc.
Humm, now I’ve re-read what I’ve
just written it sounded considerably
more plausible (and normal) in the bar,
now it just sounds silly. Finally imagine
you are on a packed train but in the
morning, everyone is silent except a
couple downstairs having a domestic.
The whole bus can hear quite clearly
and halfway through the journey, the
male participant pipes up with the
quote below. H-fucking-larious.
Stuff Imperial students like:
8. Science Fiction:
As much as it pains me to say this,
apparently here at Imperial we love
a good bit of Sci-Fi. We do have Eu-
rope’s biggest Sci-Fi library. Unfor-
tunately. But apparently we fucking
love a good science fiction read.
I personally don’t see why we
need a whole big library for what
is essentially literature and can be
found in any other library in the
land, but each to their own. Howev-
er over my years at Imperial I have
noticed a similar tradition running
through the whole of the Sci-Fi cli-
entele, the longness of hair and of-
ten lack of shower.
Now this could be due to the nev-
er ending bench-pressing of huge
novels, or because they are so keen
to read that a shower comes pretty
much necessary. Whatever the rea-
son, there is no excuse to shag in the
west wing basement toilets is there
NHS specs boy? Yes we all heard
you last year. Twat.
Sci-Fi, take note. Water = women
