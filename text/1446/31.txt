I made a mistake last
week: the penultimate
row should have read
“4 1 2” but it actually
read “4 1”. Ah well shit
happens. Thanks to all
those who pointed it
out. We promise that
this one will not be
broken.
Oh by the way, it was
a third of the recycle
symbol... it was green

Oh hai guyz. Lets get more entries for
this one this week- we only had two
entries! Right, anyway the winner was
Your Mum. Very mature lads, as far
as I am aware that phrase should only
be used in answer to the question, “so
what you feel like doing tonight?”. You
can see how it works.
