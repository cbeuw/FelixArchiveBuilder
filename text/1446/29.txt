Putting the cat out to dry
You’ve seen them out there in the
fields, just standing there, and thought
to yourself, ‘I could do that!’
WELL STOP! These brash and care-
less thoughts could wind up with you
dead. Unless you have the professional
training for such a dangerous sport,
you should leave tree imitation well
alone.
This child thought it would be funny
to pretend to be a large Oak.
You may laugh at the title, but it is a serious sport, with serious consequences if treated irresponsibly

The Beginner’s Guide to Tree Imitation
It wasn’t so funny when he was dead!
However, if you think you’ve got the
balls it takes to be a tree, then here are
some steps that will see you on the way
to becoming the master of disguise.
DISCLAIMER: HANGMAN TAKES
NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY SE-
RIOUS INJURIES OR DEATHS THAT
MAY OCCUR FROM FOLLOW-
ING THIS GUIDE. YOU ATTEMPT
TREEMING AT YOUR OWN RISK
HISTORY: The sport of tree imita-
tion, or ‘treeming’, was invented by
Ronnie Beckstein in 1943 when he dis-
guised himself as a Sicamore to escape
the the hounding German forces. Un-
fortunately, Ronnie was captured two
months later when Goebbel’s Dachs-
hund pissed on his leg.
After the war, the sport took off in East
Germany, spearheaded by Beckstein’s
son Raymond. Raymond founded the
Standard Tree Imitating Code (STIC),
which are the basic guidelines used
by the International Treeming Asso-
ciation today. The ITA have been the
sport’s official governing body since
1954 and set the standard treeming
regulations for the now professional
and highly-regarded sport.
RULE 1: Don’t treem in a heavily
wooded area, you might blend in too
well and become lost. Tragedgy struck

the sport in 1982 when seven teams,
including global reigning champions,
the ‘Arboreal Augsburgers’, went miss-
ing in the Black Forest. The ITA, with
worldwide government support, have
started a large-scale deforestation pro-
gram to ensure that the ‘Great treem-
ing disaster of ‘82’ does not happen
again.
RULE 2: Avoid large uninhabited and
desolate areas. When the sport pre
We love hearing from the fans and have
received some really warm feedback
“I am an up-standing member of society.
I recycle, walk to university and generally
do all that I can to reduce my carbon
footprint. Your ‘Guide to being green’ was
a reckless and harmful piece of writing (if
you can call it that). The most irritating
part of the article was the fact that you
consider this to be amusing. OUR PLANET
IS DYING!!! GROW UP!! I am not prone to
being aggressive, but you pile of w******
are the reason our generation are seen
as pathetic and the reason Roy resigned, I
hope you’re happy ” Loves hangman so
much they use it as toilet paper.

FFS! Does dat mean ur not playin COD tonight?
Last week, the Union decided that in
order to make some money to fund the
brothel being built on the first floor
of the Union building, plastic figu-
rines of all the Union Sabbs and staff
should be sold to students. Ashley and
Danny (they’re important) told Hang-
man that the models were proving to
be highly popular with the Science Fic-
tion society.
Unfortunately, and indeed surpris-
ingly, the rest of the student body were
not particularly receptive to the mod-
els. Ashley Brown seemed highly con-
fused when confronted with the issue;
“But I come with interchangable out-
fits and a pink fire engine!”
None of the Deputy Presidents or
Union Staff were available to com-
ment, it is suspected that two of them
are critically ill having swallowed in-

MELTDOWN
(We’ve gone green for Green Week,
not that we weren’t green before...)
distinguishable plastic parts.
Having spent a total of £520,000 on
the entire stock, the Union don’t have
any more funds to pay for heating, so
half the models will be burned as fuel
and once melted down, the plastic will
be fashioned into a giant statue of Rus-
sell Brand (‘cos he’s too cool...bleurgh).
The other half have been donated to
the Chinese Army for target practice.
They returned the gesture with a cer-
emonial rifle with five bullets engaged.
Come on Barbie, let’s go party (in dBs)

miered at the 2000 Sydney Olypmics,
it caused mass panic throughout the
Nation as most Australians had never
seen a tree before. Treeming has con-
sequently been banned in Australia,
much to the dismay of Kylie Minogue,
who was an avid Treemer. Many people
speculate that this was the reason for
her moving to East Germany and that
her song ‘Locomotion’ was released as
a protest to the banning. She had to re-
place ‘treeming’ with ‘locomotion’ for
legal purposes.
RULE 3: No Shrubbery imitation
In 1998, Christians protested against
the sport, saying that it was actually
invented by Jesus when he wore the
crown of thorns and attempted to imi-
tate a Gorse bush.
The ITA retorted with a statement
saying ‘Eye witness accounts from the
bible say that the crown of thorns was
placed upon Jesus’ head by soliders
and not himself.
If, however, it was the case that Je-
sus did in fact use the thorny foliage
as a tactical guise to escape, he did so
in a wreckless manner and thus failed
miserably.
Jesus did not just die for our sins, he
showed us the real danger of the ex-
treme sport that is treeming’
The ITA conseqently banned the im-
iation of shrubbery and thorny bushes
in the sport.
Hangman jokes about many things,
but says this to you with all serious-
ness: TREEM CAREFULLY!
