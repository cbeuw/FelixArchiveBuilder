Sunday saw the Imperial Immortals
take to the road for their first ever
away game, hosted by the Anglia
Ruskin Phantoms. After a baptism of
fire against a strong Portsmouth side
to open the season, expectations were
high for the Immortals to bounce
Valiant effort by Immortals
back and be competitive against the
Phantoms.
On a blustery day in Chelmsford, the
Immortals went behind early giving up
a touchdown and two point conversion
on the Phantoms’ first series. However
they bounced back after an explosive
52 yard kick return by Jake Murphy
and a 14 yard run by full-back Alex
Karvelas setting up an 11 yard touch-
down run for Tino Millar on their next
possession.
Despite some stout defensive work
Geoffrey Chow American Football from the Immortals, including a pair
of sacks by Charlie Kennedy and Ge-
offrey Chow, the Phantoms scored on
their next two possessions, opening
up a 22-6 lead. The Immortals offense
responded with a 30 yard drive, in-
cluding a run of 20 yards by quarter-
back Edward Fisher, but they were un-
able to find the end-zone again before
half-time.
After the break the Immortals con-
trolled the 3rd quarter and strong
defence and special teams work was
rewarded with a safety, when Quirin
Grossman blocked a punt in the end
zone to make the score 8-22. The of-
fense put together drives of 49 yards
and 66 yards, including a career long
for running back Tino Millar of 35
yards, ably supported by Dan Groszek,
Alex Karvelas and Daniel Jones who
also contributed yardage.
Despite the intense pressure the Im-
mortals put on the Phantoms, they
were unable to put more points on the
board and the Phantoms managed to
break one final run to end the game
8-28.
Despite the loss the team was bu-
oyed by managing to put 265 yards of
total offence and forcing 2 turnovers
on a team with 6 seasons experience
on them.
MVP honours were as follows:
Offensive - Tino Millar
Defensive - Quirin Grossman
Offensive Line - Frederico Sanches
Overall - Charles Kennedy

Eagles overcome UCL
“It was probably the worst Handball
game I have ever had to see, let alone
be involved in!”
A quote which, despite bearing nega-
tivity, is needed in order for the team to
maintain a clear conscience.
After losing our league 2 debut to
Warwick University 2 weeks ago, we
were all set to play Loughborough last
weekend.
They were a team we were able to
beat last season, but that does not face
the problem of having to rely on an
influx of new Erasmus students each
year, which gives them the advantage
of having greater consistency through-
out the seasons.
Due to the recent restructuring of
the league’s divisions Loughborough
were moved to a different group and
have been replaced by UCL, who en-
tered a Handball team for the first time
in their history.
In spite of never having played them
before, this match was going to be in-
tense from the moment the teams met
at the tube station (it was also the first
time the UCL players met each other),
since there was a lot of pride and pres-
tige involved.
It took a while for the game to gain
momentum (if there was any), but
