T
hey were forced to add the
1979 to their name by LCD
Soundsystem leader; James
Murphey’s DFA label, which
is funny because this album for many
represented the antithesis of the early
00’s dance punk scene. DFA records
were the cool looking people with
their designer drugs, whilst DFA
1979 represented the kids with bleed-
ing noses who start mosh pits in the
trendy clubs. They even declared a
“Jihad” on James Murphy, elaborat-
ing; “if I had the resources I would fly
a plane into his skull.” It’s this kind of
unfathomable bad taste that typifies
this album.
DFA ’79’s sound is simple, compris-
ing of just a heavily distorted bass
guitar, drums and voice. Described by
Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone
Age as akin to the sound of dinosaurs
fighting. The album is relentless in
pace and by all accounts should come
off as a straight punk album, but the
vocals sound as if they’ve been har-
vested from pop songs and given
a course of steroids. Every song is
stripped down to its raw parts, with
no excess fat, making it accessible to
fresh ears.
Lyrically, as the title of the album
suggests, it is full of chauvinistic one
liners like “You’re a woman and I know
It’s true / from the things that I have
done to you” and angry break up rant-
ing: “Now that this is over this weight is
off my shoulder/ now that this is over, I
love you more and more.” In any other
context these lyrics wouldn’t work, but
the driving force of the music grounds
and empowers their meaning.
The ferocity of their music trans-
lated to the band’s working lives, cre-

f given the names of the two art-
ists that have illuminated the
Bush Hall last Wednesday No-
vember 11th, very few would rec-
ognize them. That appears to be the
cruel fate of singers-songwriters, how-
ever famous they might get at some
point in their life. Maybe there’s too
many of them? Maybe they’re too mel-
low to turn the beat around? I person-
ally blame it on the fact that too many
singer-songwriters fall indubitably into
the slow romantic ballads that make
me want to...
However, with tenacity and an ad-
venturous mind, you can find good
ones. For example the London-born
Billy Franks who sings his thoughts
with a sometimes soft, sometimes gut-
voice. But he thereafter provided a
wide array of pieces, from his new al-
bum American Sunshine to his first
hit Down Under (assisted by his lovely
wife at the back vocals and imaginary
flute), passing by his 1990s singles and
some of the Scrubs’ fans’ requests. Re-
markable voice range, perfectly and
creatively produced, with striking
guitar skills; the almost-duo was ex-
tremely amusing and entertaining to
watch, connecting with the audience
for a short but impeccable perform-
ance. Colin Hay will probably remain
a famous but still low-key singer-
songwriter that would easily become
legend in a couple of decades. As for
Billy Franks, it is worth trying to find
his next performance to see him in his
element.
On the search for singer-songwriters...
Emilie Beauchamp seeks out Colin Hays and Billy Franks @ Bush Hall
tural voice to give us an insight on vari-
ous facts of life. How it is to grow up
in a Fulham Court council tax estate,
how you most often sleep better when
it rains, or how an idyllic summer in
New York can turn sour. Said to have
been praised by Bono, Peter Gabriel
and Oasis, Franks was part of the 80s
band The Faith Brothers before start-
ing a solo career trooping around Lon-
don pubs. His lyrics are genuine and
amusing, his voice is definitely charm-
ing and his scene presence flattering.
However, the guitar rhythms are of-
ten quite simple, especially in compari-
son with the icon following his warmly
received performance.
Second on stage and awaited by a
fairly good audience was half-Scottish
half-Australian Colin Hay, who has
transcended decades with a few, but
widely known hits. Remember Men at
Work’s “Down Under”?
Well, Colin Hay was the lead singer
of Men at Work... While quite an ob-
scure persona, Hay has been re-made
popular by his numerous appearanc-
es in the American television series
Scrubs in the past few years and thus
touched several generations through-
out his career.
Still, Hay is quite aware of his non
superstar status and jokes about it
throughout the performance. Quite
talkative in the beginning, I was al-
most convinced he was chatting about
Australian goats and the Scottish land-
scape because he had lost his talented

loosest sense of the world, with the
song “Let’s make Love and Listen to

sidered it’s probably the best way to

The latest results are in! Biffy
Clyro have been blown out of
the top ten and are somewhere
around the tail end of the top
50. In similarly good news,
Animal Collective reign supreme.
