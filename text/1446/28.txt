Drunken-mate photo of the week
xkcd.com
The moral of this story is: don’t get drunk and crash out when your mate’s got a
used condom and no bin. But hey, at least they used protection!
Got a picture of
your mate being
an absolute waste
of oxygen? Well,
get your camera
out and email your
drunken-mate
photos to catnip.

Your mum happened to him. She was so fat, she crushed
him. The jelly-like remains are being sent to UCL to
resolidify.
