n a report issued on Tuesday in Shanghai, the World Health Or-
ganization and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS
(UNAIDS) said that an estimated 33.4 million people worldwide
were infected with HIV.
This figure is slightly higher than the 33 million in 2007, and most
those affected (an overwhelming 22.4 million) live in sub-Saharan Africa. Al-
most two thirds of the new infections occurred there as well. The second
most affected region is South and South-East Asia (3.8 million), followed by
Latin America (2.0 million).
Some improvements have been made however, as the death toll from AIDS
has fallen by 10 percent over the past five years, largely due to greater access
to anti-retroviral drugs.
In sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of infection has fallen to 400,000 people in
2008, down 15 percent from 2001. In the same time frame, new infections
decreased by 25 percent in East Asia, and 10 percent in South and South-East
Asia.

T
he European Un-
ion elected Bel-
gian Prime Min-
ister Herman
van Rompuy as
the first President of the
European Union Council,
and Lady Catherine Ashton
of the UK as its new High
Representative for Foreign
Affairs and Security Policy.
The nominations come after
the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, which establishes mandates for the two
roles, but the exact distribution of power will depend significantly on how
the roles are managed by Mr. Van Rompuy and Lady Ashton. Both politicians
were relatively unknown, unlike other candidates who had been touted for
the job. The decision should ensure that individual nations will retain their
voice on the world stage, instead of becoming subject to the European Un-
ion’s will.
Following his selection, Mr. Van Rompuy stressed his credentials as a con-
sensus politician, and indeed his 10 months as Prime Minister in Belgium
have been successful in bridging the gaps between the country’s linguisti-
cally divided communities. He made it clear that he would fulfill the role of a
chairman rather than a ‘globe-trotting statesman’. Lady Ashton’s nomination,
which is seen as a concession to the UK, has come under attack from critics –
she has never held a directly elected position and has served in her previous
role as European Trade Commissioner for just over a year.

M
exico has seen its credit rating downgraded to BBB by Fitch
Ratings, following a fall in output from the oil sector as its
reserves in the Gulf of Mexico are drying up.
Fitch, a rating agency, said that decreasing oil incomes,
which make up a third of Mexico’s public sector revenues, have weakened
the country’s ability to weather financial problems. The rating was reduced
from BBB+ to BBB, which means that the government will now face increased
costs of borrowing.
While this rating remains of ‘investment grade’, a statement from Mexico’s
Treasury Department said President Felipe Calderon has made important ad-
vances to address the structural weaknesses pointed out by Fitch and imple-
ment reforms that can increase competitiveness and growth.

The Shadow Chancellor of the Ex-
chequer paid a visit to Sir Roy Ander-
son and Imperial College London on
Tuesday 24th November, with an aim
to highlight the Conservatives’ green
ideas for the UK economy.
George Osborne began the evening
by meeting with Sir Roy to discuss the
potential that science and technology re-
search holds for the UK. Sir Roy spoke of
the event: “It’s highly appropriate that the
Shadow Chancellor should take an in-
terest in green technologies… Products
and solutions developed at places like
Imperial will ensure the UK’s economic
competitiveness on the global stage.” Af-
ter their discussion, Mr. Osborne gave a
speech to academics, environmentalists
and media in the Business School. This
was followed by a question and answer
session about the proposals made during
his speech.
It is not the first time that Mr. Os-
borne has visited Imperial: in February
2008, Mr. Osborne held a speech in the
SAF Building which addressed the UK’s
environmental technology and in par-
ticular, praised Imperial College for its
investment in environmentally green
technology.
He called for more universities to fol-
low Imperial’s lead and create their own
incubator model, which gives green
technology entrepreneurs the financial
support and business expertise they
require.
The proposals made during Mr. Os-
borne’s speech on Tuesday evening came
as no surprise, as he had personally writ-
ten in The Independant that morning to
announce his plans for the economy. His
speech therefore reiterated what he had
already published, as well as what other
press had promptly reported on, which
includes:
• Paying the public to recycle
• Giving government Departments
Conservatives keen to go green
less money if they fail to reduce
energy consumption
• Creating a green trading market
• Cutting government CO2 emis-
sions by 10% in 12 months
Mr. Osborne said: “I think we can go
even further in catalysing green finance
in the UK. In my speech here at Impe-
rial last year, I proposed the creation of a
new green trading market...” This trading
market, called the Environmental Op-
portunities Index, currently has almost a
hundred companies signed up.
The notion of the Conservatives go-
ing green was exhausted in Mr. Os-
borne’s article in The Independant, in
which he used the word ‘green’ no less
than 18 times. His speech presented the
idea of Green Investment Banks, which
he claims “will help us…to decarbonise
our economy”. He also spoke about the
company RecycleBank which has been
able to increase recycling in America
“by paying the public to recycle - with-
out the need for any extra government
spending.”
All of the proposals set by Mr. Os-
borne, and his five other colleagues
within the same week, are clearly in
preparation for the global negotiations
in Copenhagen next month. Given the
Conservatives’ anti-EU agenda, it is diffi-
cult to see how they will successfully act
on climate change alone.
