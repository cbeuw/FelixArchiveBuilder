MUSIC
Souls of Mischief back with a new album
A
s Jamie and I wait in the
corridor, outside Souls of
Mischief’s hotel room, Opio
suddenly emerges, gives us
a brief glance and heads off to who
knows where. We’re then led in by
their PR manager and introduced, I
go for a handshake, Tajai presents his
fist instead and an awkward mangle
of knuckles occurs. There’s not much
space so we sit on the bed and I get
the feeling, as Tajai gets the measure
of us, that he’s forming as much of an
impression of us as we hope to form of
him. “How are we doing this, recording
or filming”, he asks, and I reply weakly
that I’m just going to take notes. He
looks at my flimsy file-pad and assents,
first impressions confirmed.
Their latest album, Montezuma’s
Revenge (named after the street where
they recorded it, not the nasty sen-
sation you get after eating a dodgy
burrito) was produced by the legen-
dary Prince Paul (who produced De
La Soul’s landmark album 3 Feet High
and Rising). Phesto explains that he
met him on tour and approached
him. “He’s a genius, everything that
he touches is gold, an instant classic”.
We ask him what it’s like to work with
such an influential producer, “It’s a big
deal obviously, he upped our game.
He’s got a vision for the record that he
wants you to follow, he’s not just a beat
maker like some other producers, he
shapes the whole song”.
Although the group are predictably
full of praise for the producer (even
calling the knobs on his mixer, Prince
Paul’s ‘weapons’), they’re obviously re-
iterating the same stuff they’ve been
saying all day. However when the con-
versation turns to the music industry,
Tajai becomes more animated.
I ask them if they think the changes
in the music industry over the last
twenty years affected how they ap-
proached their album and Tajai is
quick to point out a flaw in my logic.
“The industry hasn’t changed, sure the
method of distribution is different but
making a record is the same as it’s ever
been: it’s hard work”. He continues
saying that the major record labels are
still the same: “There’s always been
a few artists who are innovators and
about 30 others that labels sign just
because they sound the same as the
innovators”.
When you remember that for the last
20 years Souls of Mischief have been
ignoring musical trends and hype and
making the kind of music that they
like making, it’s less surprising that
Tajai has little time for doomsday pre-
dictions of the music industry.
Later in the interview, he pours cold
water on the supposed death of the al-
bum. “People don’t remember singles,
when you look at the history of mu-
sic, who talks about singles? It’s short
stories vs novels, they both have their
place but ultimately it’s novels that
make an impact”.
He similarly has little time for the
‘controversy’ over the use of Auto-
tune, hailing T-Pain as a genius and
saying that like most things, “It’s good
when used well and bad when used
badly. It’s nothing new, it’s been used
in dancehalls for ages.”
Phesto however does call out people
who use it to disguise a lack of tal-
ent. “They don’t want to get someone
else to sing it, it’s narcissistic, people
will say “but you weren’t in the video”
but they’re not proud enough to just
say “yeah but I wrote it”, people don’t
think like that anymore”. He hammers
home his point with a guitar analogy
for our benefit, “If you’ve got a distor-
tion pedal but you can’t play guitar, it’s
not going to help is it?”
I pick up on Tajai’s comment about
albums making an impact and ask
him why after their classic debut 93
til Infinity in 1993, Souls Of Mischief
haven’t made as big of an impact on
the rap scene. He takes a moment,
considering the question before an-
swering. “Timing, it’s all timing and
newness. When we released the first
Hieroglyphics album, people talked
about that as a classic”. It’s clear that
he doesn’t waste his thoughts on how
much hype their music creates but
Phesto adds, “A lot of the success of
that album came from the video for
93 til Infinity”; “Back then” Tajai in-
terjects, “Music channels were varied
but today they’re all owned by the
same company and you get the same
music on almost every channel” which
ties in with his belief that the industry
hasn’t changed, just the methods of
distribution.
Jamie turns the conversation to
the guys themselves and what’s kept
them together over 20 years. Tajai
responds tiredly; the day’s wearing
on and they’ve been doing non-stop
interviews for almost 6 hours, “We’re
all friends, we’ve known each other
for decades” before giving us another
analogy for our benefit: “Friends meet
through soccer and even if they don’t
always play, they’re still going to hang
out”. It’s nearing the end of the in-
terview when Opio returns. His dark
shades combined with his afro all but
disguise his face but he’s keen to pick
up the thread of the conversation,
“We’re lucky to have the ‘job’ that we
have, you can’t complain when your
job is rapping with your homeboys”,
he thinks for a moment before add-
ing “Although people sometimes for-
get that it’s a lot of hard work, it’s not
just 1 hour on stage, it’s the other 23
hours of the day as well, it’s not just
sex, drugs and rock n roll”.
Questions for
Ty Vaughn
Portland’s musical heritage: “We
don’t fit with typical Portland bands,
The Decemberists, The Thermals,
those guys. But Oregon means a lot to
us.”
Converting from hardcore punk to
pop punk: “The hardcore scene re-
ally welcomed us with open arms. I
think the kids enjoyed having a break,
something they could sing along to.”
EB: I know hardcore scenes can be
closed-minded. “If anyone was closed-
minded, it was me… I didn’t want
to play hardcore shows, but all our
friends were in hardcore bands and we
couldn’t get any others. I’m glad we did
it now, though.”
Influences: “Green Day were a huge
influence on us… well, everything they
did more than a decade ago. They’re
still one of my favourite bands though.”
Billie Joe Armstrong’s part on sign-
ing the band to his label, Adeline
Records: “He didn’t. I think right be-
fore American Idiot he realised he
couldn’t juggle playing in a band, tour-
ing and running a record label while
still having time for his family.”
Basement gigs vs festival shows: “It’s
completely different. We like both. At
Reading I saw Gallows, and that was
amazing… for most of the gig most
of the band were playing out in the
crowd. They’re a great band.”
The Smiths and hardcore punk: “I
didn’t get it for a long time. You’d go
to shows and there’d be hardcore kids
with “The Smiths” tattooed on their
arms. But they were a great band.”
Hardcore or post-hardcore?
“Hardcore.”
Hip hop or drum ‘n’ bass? “Hip hop.”
Death metal or grindcore? “I’m not
sure I know the difference between
those…”
Emo or crunk? “Emo.”
Black Flag or Bad Brains? “Black
Flag.”
Tupac or Biggie? “Tupac. Gotta keep
it west coast, you know?”
Swine flu or bird flu? “Um… I’m not
sure of the symptoms, but… bird flu.”
