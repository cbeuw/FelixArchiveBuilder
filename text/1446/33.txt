Aunty McPickle is a bit nippy this week. No, literally.
Dear Aunty McPickle,
On a recent binge trip to Milan I
decided to get my nipple pierced. It
was going relatively ok until I felt a
strange oozing sensation from the
tip of the nipple and a white milky-
rice-pudding like substance started
running down my chest. I hoped it
would stop after a couple of days but
it hasn’t.
I am now lactating and have to
wear several layers to hide it. What
do I do?
Joseph Sparrow
Dear Joseph
Woah.
Must have a been a right corker! Al-
though males don’t lactate under nor-
mal circumstances, when stimulated
excessively (or in your case pierced) lac-
tation can be initiated. Have you been
playing with it too much? Or perhaps
running current through it. It may just
be a lot of pus which needs to be let out
but either way you should defs get this
looked at.
In the meantime, however, you could
consider investing in a pair of nipple
pads. Oh, and avoid strong magnets,
as well as running shirtless into electric
fences.

Dear Aunty Mc Pickle,
I have started having trouble getting
aroused by my girlfriend in the nor-
mal bed setting.
A nagging desire for something
more exciting has perpetuated itself:
the physics showers. Do you think I
can get away with it?
Stevie Hasselhoff
Dear Stevie,
I’m pretty sure this has been done be-
fore; at least there are rumours of it. I
think you should maybe consider why
your girlfriend in particular is not
arousing you anymore. Maybe it has
less to do with the place but more to do
with her face? In that case, you should
consider getting her a boob job and a
paper bag for Christmas. If you don’t
think this is a problem then experi-
menting is totally healthy.
However, getting caught out might
earn you a rather peculiar rep. You
could both try wearing the paper bags,
but if they happen to come off when
you’re discovered, you’ll earn an even
weirder reputation.
Then again, it’s not as if everyone
that does physics is exactly “normal”,
even for Imperial standards.
Yours,

You’d better let some out to relieve the pressure, Joe, otherwise you’ll look like this
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I recently had my boyfriend over for
the weekend and we decided to have
a steamy moment in the sauna. My
mum had been asleep but apparent-
ly woke up and decided to walk into
the bathroom fully starkers to take a
shower!
We hid behind the wall but had to
face the shower to avoid being seen.
My boyfriend couldn’t take his eyes
off of her naked body and he seemed
to have a much larger erection than
he has with me. It was four whole
inches!
Should I feel jealous?
Michelle Bigrod
Dear Michelle,
This sounds a bit embarrassing. At
least your mum didn’t see you two. I
would probably try to forget about the
whole episode. It must have been a very
confusing situation for your boyfriend
but maybe watch out for him checking
her out or attempting footsy in the fu-
ture. That would not be cool.
If you do happen to catch him flirting,
cut his tiny cock off, either literally or
figuratively - I’ll leave that up to you.
Don’t feel too upset, though. He’ll know
that you’ll look like her in twenty years
anyway.
Hope you get through this,
Aunty McPickle xxx
Y
ou may have heard about
our upcoming carol-singing
events, but if you haven’t,
we’re having two upcoming
carol-singing events.
Our first is this Friday, the 4th of De-
cember at Green Park Station with Im-
perial College Chamber Choir. We’ll be
needing 5-7 collectors, and if you like,
you can join in the singing!
Our main event on Monday, the 14th
of December, however, will take place
on the main stage at Trafalgar Square,
right under the massive Christmas
Tree, with the Main Choir, and we’ll be
needing about 15 to 20 collectors.
These lovely yuletide occasions are
for the benefit of The Great Ormond
Street Hospital for Children. Opened
in 1852 in Bloomsbury, this hospital
not only has the widest range of chil-
dren’s specialists out of any hospital in
the country, but also conducts leading
research in children’s medicine.
It is notable for its high-profile sup-
porters, which have included Queens
Victoria and Elizabeth, Tony Blair and
Victoria Beckham. In 1929, author JM
RAG Charities Pt. 2: Great Ormond Street Hospital
Barrie even donated the rights to his
play and novel Peter Pan to the hos-
pital, so that it recieves royalties from
productions of the play and sales of the
novel.
Nevertheless, the hospital continually
needs to pay for accommodation, not
only for the patients, but their parents, as
well as new equipment and their exten-
sive research into children’s medicine.
So if you’re interested in helping out
such a worthy cause, don’t hesitate to
contact us at rag@imperial.ac.uk to
join in with the Christmasness! Some patients from the Great Ormond Street Hospital website (GOSH.org)
