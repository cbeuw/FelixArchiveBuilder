The Bimonthly Fabric compilation al-
bums have reached a legendry 50 re-
leases (the clue is in the name – who
needs a creative album title anyway?)
and are still going strong after 8 years
of trance-inducing techno, house,
electro and not forgetting drum and/
or bass. Album opener Joy Fantastic is
a catchy glam-electro number armed
with wispy falsetto vocals and I’m pret-
ty sure Elmo gets involved too at the
end. Most tracks create a chilled-out
lounge atmosphere with the inclusion
of heavy bass that makes you think
your head is being slowly torn apart,
fast but light erratic drum loops and
a variety of hand claps, bongos and
other such percussions. As with many
DJ mixes it is not so much a collection
of good and bad songs as it is a hazy
journey through a fantastic musical
jungle.- Tom Jennings
Nonsense in the dark, a track taken
from the Filthy Dukes album that bears
the same name plods down a dreamy
synth pop road for six and a half min-
utes. I assume (and hope) there’s going
to be a reasonable length radio edit
because only one idea seems to pre-
vail throughout, stagnating well before
halfway.
It is a case of purely unoffensive elec-
tro with a large dose of sugary pop,
leaving it devoid of any notion of sub-
stance or passion.
The vocals are just running through
the motions, apathetic warbling a mere
substitute for anything interesting to
say. I wouldn’t be surprised find its way
to soundtracking a teen TV drama of
similar calibre.

‘The Man’s Machine’ is the kind of song
that puts some swagger in your step.
It’s bass-heavy with crashing cymbals
and rising electronic nuggets putting
the icing on the cake. Lyrically he’s on
top form telling tales of travelling with
his usual dexterity “Met a matador, he
said a wild woman is more, terrifying
than any red bull he saw”. The other
tracks on the EP will appeal to Jamie T
fans but ‘Man Not A Monster’ is a great
classic ska feet mover that few will be
able to resist. - Kadhim Shubber

This song is basically just syncopated
synth beats combined with repetitive
hip-hop vocals. It’s meant to be fresh
but it’s bloody awful. It lacks any feel
good factor but would probably go
down well at Tiger Tiger. - Ed Knock

he pop world is a harsh place,
justmakingmusicisn’tenough,
you have to be a character and
spread your image into differ-
ent facets of the media’s money-making
machine according to your demograph-
ic. Once upon a time this meant mak-
ing dolls that look nothing like you and
stationary sets for kids to nag their par-
ents to buy for them from Woolworths.
Nowadays, if you’re a pop band like Girls
Aloud, you make a line of false eyelashes
for Boots, presumably for girls who will
end up looking like Jodie Marsh in ten
years time.
But that’s just for the throw-a-way fla-
vour-of-the-months. Anyone who’s any-
one in the music world is also... *dramatic
pause* ...an actor! The latest actor to take
a turn on the silver screen is Jarvis Cocker
who plays himself with a Banjo (a.k.a. Pe-
tey) in Wes Anderson’s latest film, Fan-
tastic Mr. Fox. It wouldn’t be a Wes An-
derson film without characters in brown
suitsandcravats,suitablyretroanimation
and a cameo from a suitably cool indie
personality. This isn’t the first time Jarvis
has graced our screens in a kid’s film, he
played in the band the Weird Sisters in
one of the Harry Potter films, doing “the
hippogriff” for those wizard kids to get
down to at Harry’s winter ball.
Mariah Carey and Britney Spears
somehow persuaded enough people that
it would be a good idea for them to star in
their own films, 2001’s Glitter and 2002’s
Crossroads, respectively. Needless to say,
as they are both such vacuums of talent
anyway these films crashed and burned
at the box office.
Some artists have managed to dab-
ble on both sides throughout their ca-
reers (and no I don’t mean Miley Cyrus).
Where many rappers have tried, only one
has truly managed to bridge the gap be-
tween film and music. Mos Def started
his rap career in the 90s and had already
had a role as Bill Cosby’s sidekick in a de-
tective show called The Cosby Mysteries
(I’m not making this up!) before his rap
career took off. Now he’s been in every-
thing from Dave Chappelle’s Block Party,
to quirky comedy Be Kind Rewind, to
an episode of House. Others, like Will
Smith, Eminem and Queen Latifah, have
only found huge success on one side of
the bridge (although Will Smith did give
us “Miami” and “Summertime”).
But my personal favourite has to be LL
Cool J (that stands for Ladies Love Cool
James, don’t you know), who stars in one
of the best films ever made: Deep Blue
Sea. I don’t want to say too much about
this film, because I encourage you all to
watch it, but LL Cool J stars as a chef with
a pet parrot (which, yes, sits on his shoul-
der) and a super-intellegent shark man-
ages to trap him in an oven, and turn it
on. If that isn’t top quality high brow en-
tertainment for you I don’t know what is.

greater than 1000
Catchy electro house is the music of the
day, as it always has been for the Prodi-
gy, and this is certainly a higher quality
remix collection than I am accustomed
to from musicians (bar Fabric). Per-
sonally I prefer the original tracks from
Invaders Must Die to the remixes and
would rather listen to them properly
in my own intoxicated rave-orgy, but
either way you still receive that rush
of euphoria and the feeling that Keith
Flint could kick down your door any
moment and set fire to your lab re-
ports. - Tom Jennings
This album takes you back to when
guys with slicked back hair and sharp
suits were called crooners not bank-
ers. The vocals are stylish and charm-
ing while the melodies make you want
to get your friends together, dance
around and take sepia-tinted photos.
It’s basically been on repeat on my iPod
for about a month. - Kadhim Shubber

I’ll explain. Frequenting small music
venues and undergoing the micro-
gigging experience are infinitely more
rewarding than seeing chart-topping
bands in high capacity venues for the
following reasons:
Crowd/band interaction is funda-
mental for small bands as they all need
a distinguishing feature to earn them a
reputation. If your band name is Pink
Floyd or Kings of Leon, playing a tight
set of perfectly honed album mate-
rial that everyone recognizes won’t
enlighten anyone’s lives; they might
as well stay at home and listen to the
goddamn album. Gig experiences are
made more unique if you happen to
be asked to play an instrument along
with a band, if you bring along your
own instruments, if you are asked to
come up with a new song title, if they
accept your inebriated bellows for song
requests or just give you dance moves
to groove away to. If the headline act
walks off stage and sits at the nearest
table you can have a chat to find out
who their influences are, who they’re
shagging and even where the best plac-
es to buy instruments are.
Random memorable moments are
the crux of all good nights out, and
there are very few bands that can pull
off an electro theme tune of The An-
tiques Roadshow for their opening
Tom Jennings
number. If you notice a band’s bass
guitarist voraciously rubbing his cock
into the back of his guitar you can be
reassured by the fact that other bands
are willing to throw sweets and party
poppers at their devoted audience in-
stead. Lyrics can be fairly abstract and
obscure, like the tales of love based
around the uselessness of Jar Jar Binks,
and my favourite lyrics of the past week
have been “You gotta pull your dick out
at the restaurant in front of their aunt,
and jerk off with your balls smackin
the windows of the Mitsubishi Galant!”
(f.y.i. this wasn’t Coldplay). A woman
resembling Edith Piaf slashed a knife
through the air towards my face at the
previous gig as part of a French mock-
cabaret act, whilst a close acquaint-
ance of mine was being ordered to turn
the pages of a flick book with obscene
words on it. This is not the kind of ex-
perience you forget in a hurry.
Tight budgets and creative minds
make for an interesting array of instru-
ments being ‘played’, some of which I
have seen recently include ukuleles,
a melodica (mouth-organ keyboard),
banjos, a handsaw, flutes, spoons,
shoes, guitars made with planks of
wood, a cello with no body, a ukulele
made with an ice cream box, saxo-
phones, a big ‘ole jar with a hole, reel to
reel tape, cowbells, flutes, a hang (type
of Swiss steel pans) and a lesser-known
instrument that I like to call the guitar.
Cheapness is of vital importance to
students, and £3 on the door or free en-
try beats a £50 ticket planned 5 months
in advance every time. Not only is en-
try cheaper, but booze is cheaper and
more varied too. Small venues often
have a bar or two on site and serve a
wide variety of liquid meals, putting
many large venues to shame with their
extortionate prices and lack of choice
(Wembley Arena only sells two types
of beer!!!!!)
In every way, small venues beat large
venues into the ground. Now if we can
only split the O2 Arena into 50 differ-
ent smaller venues...
They look nothing like the silhouettes
This is the third consecutive album of
covers they’ve done and it’s so, so good.
You have to listen to it, it’s on spotify,
go... Seriously they cover Time After
Time, go now. - Kadhim Shubber
This album is how modern rock should
sound. Heavy guitar, distortion and vo-
cals matching Nirvana’s, this is a sound
of growling rock. Some songs sound
sluggish and painful but this is their
sound. It lacks some dynamic as songs
sometimes blur together. This debut
album gives a window to this bands po-
tential, they don’t feel like they’re giv-
ing all that they’ve got. - Luke Turner
