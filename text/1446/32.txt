COFFEE BREAK
Sorrow-scopes; horoscopes, but with a tear of sadness
Look, we don’t care if you find these too “far out” and “offensive”. It’s all legal and morally sound in our minds
Cancer
Donkeys better than
horses? You’re having
a laugh. Unless it’s a fit
donkey, in which case
I’m in for a ride too.
Might as well make
a DVD and get some cash out of this, could get
sponsored by the RSPCA too. Oh shit, PETA are
after you, quick, hide in the nearest brothel. You
like women, yes. No donkey lovers here.
Virgo
You’re standing
there, in the middle
of the field, wet and
muddy as fuck. As
you see another goal
fly past you, you start
to wonder why you even bothered turning up.
The time your brain has processed this thought,
they’ve scored 4 more goals. Fine, it’s time to get
out the razors you keep in your socks and turn
them against your own wrists. I’ll 114-nil YOU.
Gemini
You sleep through
lectures, procrasti-
nate during lunch, in-
sult your best friend’s
dead aunt, go home,
wank over the busty
biologists you noticed passing SAF, do some
work (wank), wank a bit more, relax (wank)
while your roommate pops out for a smoke, as-
sault the nearest medic, fall asleep, dream about
said biologists, wake up and repeat. Wanker.
Pisces
Amongst the dingy
lights and ‘wicked’
music of Tiger Tiger
you somehow find
yourself with a girl.
You close in for a kiss,
problem is you’re so fucked on drugs you literally
eat her face off. You don’t stop there though,
your mouth has become a gurning machine, and
while she thinks you’re having a stroke, you’re
busy trying to stroke her. Fail.
Leo
Oh, you’re a website
are you? Fuck me, you
don’t seem to be acting
like one. An update a
week? That’s almost as
frequent as a certain
newspaper on campus. All you are is a one-stop-
shop for masturbating hacks as they ejaculate all
over the underside of their desks at the thought of
incorrectly filled-in Minibus hire forms. Oh, the
sexy lapse in security. Oh, the humanity! SPLAT.
Aries
He’s not going to
sleep with you, quit
the Facebook stalking
and stop planning the
murder of his current
girlfriend. She’s more
awesome than you and rides him like a pro. You
need more experience. Maybe you can get some
by becoming a necrophiliac. They won’t say no.
Practice makes perfect.
Scorpio
Stop breathing my air.
Stop eating my wedges.
Stop sitting on SAF
seats like they’re yours!
You have about 7 other
campuses you could be
at. All you do is claim you’re too busy for anything,
hang out with yourselves, then up with wankered
in the Reynolds and hitting police officers. All
together now: BLOODY MEDICS. I’ll forgive you
though. I’ll forgive you though, cos you’re lovely.
Libra
You’re happily sitting
on the tube on your
way home when a big
fat Serbian bloke tries
to speak to you. He’s
just plain harrassing
you, but in a weird way you’re getting turned on.
The train halts and he ‘accidentally’ gets thrown
into your lap. He breaks your pelvis as well as
your new iPhone. You get off at Oxford Circus to
get your iPhone replaced ASAP.
Taurus
Working in the
Union has dragged
you to your lowest
depths. You’re ready
to give in and throw
yourself off the SAC
balcony leaving a bloody mess on Phil Power’s
desk below. You’ll do it, but mid-fall you realise
you’re already dead inside, and will probably
just scare poor old Phil as your torso throws
weeks of paperwork across the office.
Capricorn
You’re in the Union,
and you’ve just finished
off your thirteen pints
of John Smith’s, dirty
fucker. You stumble out
to the quad, vomit on
the nearest steward and the next thing you know,
you’ve woken up on top of the Huxley building.
Not exactly what you had in mind when you
started sports night. Arrogant fresher. Pint?
Aquarius
“I’ll eat that computer
if you down that
pint right now” you
say as you point to
the nearest library
terminal. Your mate
downs the pint easily
and it looks like you’re in the shit. You start
chomping away the screen, smash it and the
LCD crystals taste a bit like marmite. Shame you
hate marmite. You spit the gunk onto the fit girl
opposite, as library security tazer your fine ass.

Sagittarius
It’s your birthday and
you’re drunk. Surprise,
surprise. But what’s
this? You have half the
hall chasing your arse
down Exhibition Road
because you wished to be Usain Bolt when you
blew out the candles. You breeze past Ethos and
get hit by a Gee-Whiz. Check if the driver’s still
alive, the fucking loser. He’s okay, but you’re not.
Death, makes a change. Best birthday ever.
