The 2nd XI travelled to Dulwich a
week ago last Wednesday to take on
South Bank 3s in a crunch BUCS cup
2nd round clash. Imperial arrived well
before kick-off allowing for the usual
long-winded pre-match team talk from
Damian Phelan and a solid warm-up
which included some banter between
Mamzi and our Colombian referee.
The 2nds lined up in their now text-
book 4-2-3-1 formation and as the
match got underway immediately set
about imposing their passing game;
Mark Smith and Max Moesta control-
ling the tempo from their deep lying
midfield positions. Marc Hinken and
Max Kindred were majestic at cen-
tre back, dominating in the air and
stroking the ball about with aplomb
while Phil Meier and Justin Whitehous
proved formidable opponents for the
South Bank wingers. They became
frustrated at their lack of possession,
and Imperial began to look threaten-
ing on the attack.
Some neat interplay between Mam-
zi Roshid and Damian Phelan sliced
open the South Bank defence creat-
ing an opportunity for our grace-
ful new fresher, Caspar Paxton, who
just pulled his shot wide of the post.
Quickly another chance fell to Caspar
from the same source, only for him to
agonisingly strike his shot past the post
again. The South Bank goal was living
a charmed life as Sim Anandajeyarajah
and Smithy stung the keeper’s gloves
and the pressure finally became too
much as Moesta made a scything break
down the right hand side before sliding
a cracking ball into Sim who finished
coolly, striking the ball cleanly across
the face of the goal and into the bot-
tom corner. The half time whistle blew
soon after and the 2nds were pleased
to have provided themselves with a
platform from which to go on and kill
the game.
However, 10 minutes into the 2nd
half a key moment turned the game
on its head. The South Bank captain
attempted to make a substitution but
the player leaving the field decided that
he was too good to go off. He was not
having it.
The captain responded with obscen-
ities and Imperial were beginning los-
ing their focus. Finally this bizarre epi-
sode ended as the substituted player
finally trudged his way to the changing
room. Moments later a long ball over
the top outfoxed the 2nds centre backs
and bang, a crisp half volley nestled
into the corner of the goal, 1-1. A blot
on an otherwise quality performance
for the Imperial back five. The game
turned scrappy, favouring South Bank,
who threw men forward in search of
a winner. Imperial 2nds though are
made of strong stuff this season, they
regrouped and once again began to
dominate possession, the introduction
of fresher and debutant Jack Lowe pro-
viding some extra energy on the wing.
The 2nds resolve paid off as, with 15
minutes remaining, Damian played
a silky one-two with Sim on the edge
of the box, glided past the centre half
and slammed a powerful shot into the
bottom corner. With the lead restored,
confidence high and South Bank going
absolutely gung-ho for an equaliser,
Imperial felt there were more goals to
be scored. Even from right back there
was a threat, as Justin surged out of de-
fence and picked out Damian steaming
through the gaping hole in the South
Bank back four who took one touch to
set it away from the closing defender
and struck it beautifully to once again
find the bottom corner of the net and
finish the game as a contest. There
could have been even more if not for
Damian’s shameless pursuit of a hat-
trick but otherwise the 2nds finished
the game strongly to kill off the game
3-1. A fine win to guarantee progres-
sion to the 3rd round where LSE 3rds
are waiting. A special mention for Jus-
tin who was awarded the man of the
match awarded for his typically strong
defensive display which was coupled
on this occasion with some dazzling
attacking play.
Kick Racism Out
I
mperial College Football 2nd XI
used their BUCS cup tie against
London South Bank 3s to pro-
mote a cause which is important
to the football club as a whole,
the Kick Racism Out of Football cam-
paign. The team can be seen in the
accompanying photograph sporting
t-shirts in support of the the project.
These t-shirts were worn throughout
the day and into the night and will
continue to be worn by football club
members to aid in spreading the Kick
Racism Out message. The campaign
aims to use football as a means of chal-
lenging discrimination and working
for positive change in sport and in so-
ciety as a whole. It is in its 16th year
now and continues to be commended
internationally by institutions such as
the European Commission and the
British Council as a great example of
how to use sport to promote equality.
Imperial College Football Club
boasts an internationally flavoured
membership representing all races and
a variety of nations and we think it is
important to stress that this blend has
helped us to become a better club on
and off the pitch. This is why we have
decided to support the Kick Racism
Out campaign and are proud to pro-
mote the message wherever we travel.
eventually Imperial made the most of
a two-minute suspension and went
ahead. Some unforced errors and hasty
attempts to break through UCL’s de-
fence led to avoidable turnovers and
sparked hope in our opponents, but
the Eagles could rely on their solid de-
fending to secure them a 1 goal advan-
tage at half-time.
The second half demonstrated a def-
inite lack of creativity, routine and luck
in attack and with only 9 goals scored
by Imperial in the entire match (Hand-
ball scores usually exceed 20 goals for
each team); the thought of potentially
losing this fixture did cross my mind.
Fortunately, our defending abilities
exceed our attacking skills and with
the goalkeeper on form, saving 4 pen-
alties and earning himself the title of
EHA man of the match, we were able
to double our advantage just before
the final whistle and take the 2 league
points home.
All in all it was a mildly encouraging,
enthusiastic display by the Imperial
Eagles, which puts them in the top 3
of the league.
It is safe to say, however, that a team,
which orders more rounds in a pub
than they score goals in a game of
Handball, has several issues to work
on.

Fencing
success in
Cambridge
Imperial Fencing Women’s 1st team
pulled off an impressive display of
fencing last weekend to settle into the
top spot of the Southern Premiership.
The girls travelled up to Cambridge
to take part in a tournament-style af-
fair, which saw them fence their first
four matches of the season over two
intense days.
Competing against Cambridge, Ox-
frod, Bristol and UCL, the team was
only composed of five people: Cap-
tain Clare Harding; ACC sportsper-
son of the year Hannah Bryars; ICFC
president Emily Bottle and strong new
arrivals Alice Mitchell and Outi Sup-
ponen. Lack of numbers notwithstand-
ing, some very strong fencing coupled
with a deft bit of multitasking led the
1sts to victory in all four matches.
Following last year’s silverware, the
Fencing girls once again show they are
a major force to be reckoned with (and
have put the pressure on the men’s 1sts
to perform in a couple of weeks’ time
in Oxford!).
On another note, a record number of
fencing novices are going up to War-
wick this weekend for a chance to cut
their teeth at a big competition. Good
luck guys!
