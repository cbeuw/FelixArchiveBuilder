Legendary Parisenne boutique
Colette arrives in London
A
ll my single ladies, I have
an important bit of news
to relay to you. Imperial
is no longer a desert to
handsome men (or man).
At precisely 11:15am on Tuesday,
I almost died. This beautiful man - a
Greek version of Gerard Butler - was
queuing behind me in the SCR. You
know when you look at someone and
your jaw drops, your heart stops and
your body melts? He has the curliest of
all hair, brown in the shape of a bar-
rister’s wig. I had to pretend that I was
looking back to check my friend just
to catch another excessive glimpse of
him. As I requested my baguette to be
toasted, he smiled at me (oh my god,
oh my god) and said ‘maybe your sand-
wich will be soggy with the salad in it’.
To which I replied, totally sensibly and
appropriately - ‘Can I touch your hair?’.
He grinned (oh my god oh my god,
oh my god) and lowered his head.
I touched it (oh my god) and he said
‘I like people touching my hair in the
morning’ in the cutest, kindest possi-
ble way without any sarcasm.
‘So what course do you do?’ I might
have been playing with my hair at this
point. ‘Biomedical Engineering, used
to based in Mech Eng you know. And
I tell people I come to London, and
of all the exciting places… I work in a
basement.’ ‘Yes, the corridor looks like
a tunnel to the death, ha-ha.’ I think I
laughed harder than he did. I com-
mented on his hair again (another ter-
rific joke about not having to wear a
wig to a courtroom) and we went our
separate ways. He said, ‘nice to meet
you’. Oh my god oh my god oh my god.
My friends say ‘point him out to us
when you run into him next time’. My
friends, I can assure you, there will be
no ‘pointing’ when I run into him. It
is likely that I will be in my heels, my
height the exact level as his. And I will
Y
ou may have seen from our
last issue that we do photo-
shoots here. The trouble is,
we always need new blood
to help out on the operational and
the creative front. First and foremost,
we need models! Male and female
alike! If you’re not afraid to wear cat-
suits, clown outfits and cool designer
clothes... Send your headshot, full
body shot, your dress size and shoe
size to fashion.felix
There is so much preparation work
Erdem will follow the footsteps of Stella
McCartney, Gareth Pugh and Giles
Deacon to show a small collection at the
V&A on the 11th December.
The V&A’s Fashion in Motion series is a
chance for those outside of the fashion
industry to see some top catwalk shows.
Entry is free but booking is essential,
phone 020 7942 2820. Booking starts

Parisian boutique Colette is to open a pop-up
shop in the East End. This week The Cube
Store unveils Colette’s first UK pop-up shop
at the Old Truman Brewery. To gain entry
you must apply online or look out for Nissan
Cube cars around the city and ask the driver
for a membership card to admit you into the
store.

accidentally run into his face.
While I am on the matter of heels,
may I congratulate Giuseppe Zanotti,
the greatest shoe sculptor that ever
existed in human history, whose un-
prounceable name has not done him a
great deal of favour so far (ju-’sep-pee
zan-’not’ti). He has been awarded shoe
designer of the year by Footwear News,
a title previously held by Manolo Blah-
nik. Giuseppe’s work does not need a
red under sole or a cute name to divert
attention. His shoes are to buildings a
Norman Foster’s design; to fast cars a
Bugatti’s masterpiece and to chairs a
Ron Arad’s creation.
Giuseppe’s shoes are mad creations
of orderly details. The shoes look
streamlined, the seams look perfect,
the embellishments are just right.
When the shoe paints a picture of
lightning, it paints it, and finishes with
10 times more edginess. When the
shoe stands as a sculpture, it stands
with confidence and conveys a sense
of frivolous fluidity. A bit like Banksy‘s
sculptures - it‘s fun and serious.
Incidently, Giuseppe Zanotti also has
one of the best shoe ads out there. Anja
Rubik has been the brand’s spokes-
woman for two seasons. The ads are
colourful, youthful, playful and are al-
ways very aesthetically pleasing.
For Carrie Bradshaw, the woman
who keeps choosing the wrong man;
may I advice that this Man-olo may not
have been the best shoe choice after all.
Anyway, if you are going to splash
out on Boxing Day, head down to
South Kensington and knock yourself
out at Giuseppe Zanotti’s boutique at
206 Walton Street. If you’re the hand-
some man I talked about earlier and
if you have any questions at all about
what I’ve written, please phone the fe-
lix office. I will be happy to attend to
your queries personally. And no... I am
not crazy! So folks, until next time.

Singer Leona Lewis to design her
own Vegan clothing range
Leona Lewis is the latest celebrity to turn
their hand to fashion design, but she was
lucky enough to get Stella McCartney’s
advice. The singer, who refuses to wear
leather or any other animal by products,
has launched her very own range of vegan
clothing and accessories.
Young model believed to have taken
her own life
Daul Kim, the beautiful 20 year old South
Korean model has sadly passed away this
week. She was found by her boyfriend
in her Paris apartment. Daul Kim has
graced the runway of Chanel, Vivienne
Westwood, Rodarte, Dries Van Noten and
the like. She was recently featured in Vogue’s
supplementary magazine in association with
Kurt Geiger. Reports have suggested that the
model may have committed suicide.
Must-have Items of
Autumn Winter 09
Photoshoot anyone?
The Vagina Boot
Named as such due to the close prox-
imity that these come to the you know
what. Not for the faint hearted, these
are possibly the sexiest item to be
found in the shops at the moment. If
you cannot afford the £1000+ price
tag for the real deal, many high street
shops do lovely copies. Wear them. Ig-
nore the stares.
Feathers
The ultimate party finisher. Be it on
the hem of a dress, a bag, jacket or
head piece there is no escaping these
this winter. Embrace the fun and look
amazing. Start small with maybe a hair
band to instantly add a high fashion
spin on your normal party attire.
Sequins
The 80s are back and they’re every-
where. Connect with your inner super-
star and go for all out sparkle or just
a subtle hint in the form of a beret or
a scarf. The cheapest and simplest way
to update your look for the winter.
The Snood
Well...because you need to keep
warm... And the name of it is cute? All
fails, get a huge scarf and wrap round.
Sales have started! Gabriella Gentilcore
tells you what to look out for
involved in a photoshoot; from meeting

well as finding shoot locations which
includes nagging restaurants, museums
and the Royal Albert Hall alike for per-

and dedicated team players this January
