Arriving at the Queen’s Tower minutes
before the strict five o’clock deadline,
I fully expected to be subjected to a
barrage of abuse for not being on time.
However it turns out that quite a few of
us were running late. With the minibus
packed and ready to go at the slightly
later time of 5:30, the club trip to Afan
forest, in the far flung corner of the UK
that is South Wales, set off.
After exhausting all normal con-
versation a few hours in our thoughts
turned to the weather or more to the
point how bad it was. The radio might
have mentioned something about the
worst storm in the UK this year ready-
ing itself to hit south Wales on the
Saturday. Luckily the storms hadn’t
worked up enough force to close the
seven bridge and we arrived at our
destination, Bryn Bettws lodge, in rela-
tively good time (six hours after setting
off in the rush hour traffic).
Saturday arrived in a mildly wet
and windy manner, but nothing of the
storms that the news had been threat-
ening the day before. After making the
most of the included breakfast at the
shockingly early time of 8:30 we set
about preparing the bikes and com-
menting on (Toby’s) kit choice before
embarking on Afan’s longest trail, w2.
After warming up with a descent fol-
lowed by a short climb, the general
consensus seemed to be that riding
all day in the slight drizzle wouldn’t
be a problem. However, only a short
while later the rain gradually built up
into a fully fledged storm, turning the
trails into muddy rivers and making us
question who had coined the laugh-
able term “waterproof”, as no item of
clothing described as such seemed to
fulfil its promise. Dave provided the
mornings’ entertainment by mysteri-
ously leaping off his bike into a bush
to inspect the local fauna. I personally
found the rest of that downhill section
challenging, it seems the side effects
of viewing Dave launch into said bush
impair the bikes’ handling somewhat.
We had planned to stop halfway
round w2 at the skyline centre in which
Cycling weather it out
in South Wales
there is an excellent cafe. On this occa-
sion, it was packed full of wet, muddy
bikers desperately trying to find an
excuse not to go back out into the
howling gale and torrential rain. After
fuelling up we continued on the trail;
mercifully the weather was starting
to improve, and just as we were about
to finish the ride several hours later,
it could even have been described as
quite nice! The afternoon was filled
with a challenging climb, littered with
exhausted riders who hadn’t quite
managed to make it too the top (or for
some people, had barely left the start!)
All the hard effort spent in the ascen-
sion was rewarded by the final descent
back to the lodge
After fully exploring Port Talbot’s
night life (well, the one pub to be found
there) Sunday dawned to the sound of
yet more rain and very strange noises
escaping from everyone’s bikes. Short-
ly after driving to the skyline centre,
so that James and I could be robbed
by the bike shop in exchange for a few
sets of brake pads, we headed to the
Penhydd centre to ride the trail of the
same name.
Luckily it had stopped raining, and
we were able to enjoy the shorter Pen-
hydd trail even fitting in a spot of light
reading at the top. After arriving back
at the trail centre car park we packed
up the minibus and headed back to
London at the rapid pace of about
62mph.
