All has not been dead at IC whilst
you've all been sunning yourselves
in distant lands. So for the benefit
of those of you who weren't
around to read the two summer
editions of FELIX, here's what
you missed.
Deputy President
P h i l Greenstreet, who was
elected Union Deputy President
last term was unable to take up
the post because he failed his
third year Physics exams.
The Union will therefore be
without a Deputy Pi^sident until
another election is held. Nomina-
tion papers for the post will go
up this week with hustings and
an election taking place at the-
end of the month.
Mascot Returned
Mike, the 1701b micrometer of
Imperial College U n i o n , was
found hidden in a cardboard box
in the Union Office only a few
feet from where it was last seen.
The mascot, which had been
missing, presumed stolen, for six
weeks, was finally discovered in
the Union Office on the after-
noon of June 28 by U n i o n
A d m i n i s t r a t o r , Jen H a r d y -
Smith. Union staff claimed to
h a v e s e a r c h e d the o f f i c e
thoroughly over the two months
Mike was missing.
LST Sued
L o n d o n Student Travel paid
£28.75 in settlement of an action
commenced against them by e.x-
IC student Paul Charlton, who
alleged that L S T ' s Imperial
Branch had sold him tickets
which were £20 dearer than
advertised.
Passwords Scrambled
July 13 a computer user, attempt-
ing to copy files from magnetic
tape onto disk gained access to
secret passwords in the Imperial
C o l l e g e C o m p u t e r Centre
( I C C C ) system. M r A r t h u r
Spirling, Operations and Service
Manager, responded by 'scram-
bling' all passwords and correct-
ing the faulty program by adding
one line. Previously users with
malicious intent have uncovered
some passwords especially those
left lying around on scraps of
p a p e r . M r S p i r l i n g highly
recommends that users regularly
change their passwords.
Prints Charming
Peter Dawson joined the F E L I X
staff in July as the new printer,
replacing Ian Morse who left the
U n i o n after eight years to
become a full-time musician.
Concrete Canoes
At the Concrete Canoe Cham-
pionships held at Thorpe Park
on June 20, IC won two design
awards for a 30kg high-alumina
cement canoe designed by third
year Civil Engineering student
Mike Rowley.
Accommodation
Student Services have arranged
to lease the Freemantle Hotel in
C r o m w e l l R o a d to provide
accommodation for students for
the next three years. A nine
months' lease has also been
agreed with owners of the
Sovereign H o t e l , Cromweil
Road, to house postgraduates.
These measures mean that all
IC freshers wishing to live in
College accommodation during
their first year will be able to do
so.
Southside Move Off?
The controversial and much
publicised plan to move Union
facilities from Beit Quadrangle
to Southside was shelved.
Instead of moving all the
Union facilities, beginning July
1983 and continuing over the
following year, College now
proposes that the Union make
use of available space in South-
side while retaining the Beit
facilities.
A complete move in the next
few years cannot be ruled out,
but for the time being there is
still scope for discussion.
Blackout
The Union Office was com-
pletely in the dark for several
days after an electrician working
in the Lower Lounge drilled
through a lighting cable.
Car Rally
The F E L I X C a r Rally was
closely won by the '21296' team.
Answering the questions took
them to such places as the
church of St Andrew-by-the-
Wardrobe, the Magic Circle
headquarters, and the surgery of
D r Phang, a Hammersmith
dentist, returning finally with the
treasure which included the
receipt for coffee at the Ritz and
four inflated balloons.
Dear Martin
I am afraid that Captain Mint
has overlooked one important
consideration when he recom-
mends that I be mandated to vet
M a r y . T h e sabbaticals are
(nominally) elected by a College-
wide ballot while posts such as
mine are voted on at one U G M .
The sabbaticals are, or should
be, more representative of the
Union than officers such as I.
Yes verily, quoth he, I am not fit
to do this deed; I would suggest
that someone independent of IC
Union, yet with a good know-
ledge of its working, perform the
task. The name comes into my
mind of Nick Morton

Granted that Council or a
U G M will overule this petty
excuse my terms for vetting
Mary are that it be done over a
candlelit dinner for two at Union
expense. In such an atmosphere
I feel sure that I will be able to
coax into the open any dark
secrets which Mary might be
hiding. Over brandy afterwards
in my room with just the stars
and Northside residents looking
in I have no doubt that Mary
will feel moved to reveal all.
I have heard rumours to the
effect that this matter is to be
pursued at the Freshers' U G M
with potentially disagreeable
consequences for both Mary and
myself. May I take this oppor-
tunity of warning the orginator
of these rumours that he would
be better occupied in retaining
his seat on Council?
I am, Sir, your most humble
minion,
Jon Barnett
Welfare Officer
PS: I am unsure as to where
Mary got the impression that I
had already concluded she was
in no need of vetting. Could this
have been during our occasional
tete-a-tetes in Falmouth Keogh
laundry (just Mary, me, two
washing machines and a tumble
drier...)?
