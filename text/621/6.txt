R e c o m m e n d e d reading for
first-year students
Your first year at college.
What you don't need are money problems to
hold you back. What you do need is practical help
to make your grant go further.
That's where we come in.
A t Lloyds Bank we've helped ease the
financial worries of generations of students and
we've got a good idea of what really comes in useful.
So we've put together a package that'll save
you money and, hopefully, give you some pleasure
into the bargain.
Cheque book & Cheque Card
Open a current account with us as a first-year,
full-time student and you get a cheque book
As soon as you pay in your first L E A or SED
grant cheque you get a Cheque Card as well. It
means your cheques are guaranteed for all payment-
up to £50.
Cashpoint
You'll also get something special. A Lloyds
Bank Cashpoint card. This lets you withdraw up to
£100 a day if your account can stand it, from over
1,250 Cashpoint machines-more than any other
bank can offer.
*You must be over 18 to borrow and
we'll provide details ofour credit terms,
^J^M ifrequired.
JgL ^ b **The Railcard or Book Token offers
i w l f are available to first-year, full-time students
only. New students opening current accounts
- j j f l ^ ^ ^ ^ tit our branches in Scotland are not eligible
to receive the Railcard or Book Token offers
and will receive a £5 opening balance
instead. These offers, including The
H Economist, close on 29th October, 1982.
^tTW M o r e
There's likely to be one near you. In some cases
on your college campus. Most Cashpoints are open
outside normal banking hours.
Statements
Regular statements will help you to keep track of
the money that is going into and out of your account.
Free banking
Free banking is another Lloyds Bank benefit.
For as long as you're in full-time further education
and you stay in credit, we'll run your current
account free of normal bank charges. Even if you
arrange to overdraw by up to £100 we'll still run
your account free of bank charges. Though, of
course, you'll have to pay interest on any money
you borrow*
Help with travel
Lloyds Bank will also help to cut the cost of
your rail travel. We'll give you a £5 voucher to get
50% off a British Rail Young Persons Railcard. A n d
that can mean, as many of our student customers
tell us, a saving of more than £50 on a year's rail
travel. Or you can opt for a £5 Book Token**
The Economist
We've arranged for all our student customers
to take advantage of an unbeatable 45% saving on
the subscription for 12 issues of The Economist-
which means you pay just £5.
We think our package of banking services and
special offers is the best available to new students.
Call at your local Lloyds Bank branch - the
staff will be happy to talk things through.
