good company
In the last five years, more students
have opened accounts with NatWest
than any other bank.
You don't need a degree to see why.
1. A CHEQUE CARD WITHOUT WAITING
New account holders are often
obliged to wait a few months before re-
ceiving a cheque card.
But, if you're 18 or over, we'll give
you a card provided you pay in your first
Local Education Authoritygrant cheque.
A cheque card guarantees pay-
ment of cheques up to £50 and means
you can draw cash from any branch in
the country.
2. FREE BANKING
Keep your account in credit and
we'll provide trie complete Current
Account Service, including regular state-
ments, without charging for it, for as long
as you remain a full-time student
3. A SERVICECARD WITHOUT WAITING
As well as a cheque card, you get a
Servicecard, too.
It means you can draw cash, up to
an agreed limit, 24 hours a day, from any
of our Serviceull machines.
You can also order an up-to-date
statement, a new cheque book and (dur-
ing working hours) get an instant check
on your bank balance. And because
NatWest has over 600 24-hour Service-
tills, which is more than any other bank
in the world,the chances areyou're never
far from one.
4. NO COMMISSION TO PAY ON
NATWEST TRAVEL CHEQUES
Our Student Service provides you
with another benefit - we take no com-
mission on any order for up to £200
worth of NatWestTravel Cheques and/or
foreign currency in any one year.
5. FREE HELP AND ADVICE
Finally, plans don't always run
smoothly. You could find yourself, say,
running out of cash before term ends or
an important field trip begins.
Thafs why we'll always be there to
help, with all the financial advice
you need.
