The New Broom
I hope you like the new look to
F E L I X (those of you who know
the old look). The main change
in content is the 'What's On'
column which will take much of
the emphasis off clubs and
Societies' articles. If Clubs and
Societies want to advertise
future events, they're welcome to
a slot in the What's On column.
If they want to relate tales of
past events, the news pages are
there to cover things which are
of general interest; things which
are only of specific interest to
people in the club don't belong
in F E L I X . I realise this will
offend lots of well-meaning
club secretaries who enjoy seeing
their writings in print, but this is
to be F E L I X policy for the next
year at least. Anyone wanting to
submit a society article should
ask me about it first, or risk
having it savagely cut or omit-
ted, and this is what has hap-
pened to several articles in this
issue. Y o u were warned last
term, and are now being warned
again!
BB Wolffe's gossip column is
no more, partly because I didn't
care too much for his heavy-
handed insults, but more be-
cause Mr Wolffe himself has
now left IC and I couldn't hope
to emulate his style. Instead
there will be a new ' d i a r y '
column which will present a
more subtly cynical view of all
kinds of aspects of student life. It
will (of course!) include any
gossip of the sort BB Wolffe
used to spread (although it will
be handled rather more sensitive-
ly) but by widening the scope of
the column it will, with luck, be
able to appear fairly regularly.
Any contributions should be
addressed to 'Below the Belt' at
the F E L I X Office.
I hope there will be the
customary blend of controversy
and wit on the Letters page this
year. D o n ' t let this week's
solitary letter (which will be
rather incomprehensible to
anyone who hasn't been follow-
ing the correspondence in the
EDITORIAL
I'm supposed to start my Editorial in the Freshers' FELIX
by welcoming you all and congratulating you on choosing
such a pinnacle of academic excellence to further your
education. Welcome, then, to IC, and congratulations to the
few of you who did choose to come here, and commiser-
ations to the rest who are here because they didn't make
Oxbridge. You're in for an exhilarating three years
(reputedly the best in your life) so make the most of what
College life has to offer.

you w r i t i n g s o m e t h i n g for
Friday's F E L I X .
The Small Ads column will
c o n t i n u e to be free to I C
students but ads must be sub-
mitted in writing on the special
forms available from the F E L I X
Office. A n o n y m o u s ads are
permitted, but the form must
carry the name of the originator,
or else the ad w i l l not be
accepted.
Thefts
Mr. Reeves of College security
has asked me to point out that
walk-in thieves descend on IC
in Freshers' week like sharks on
a helpless swimmer. For the last
two years the front page news in
the second F E L I X of the year
has been about theft at Fre-
shers' Fair and it's not hard to
see why: with so many unfamil-
iar faces in unfamiliar sur-
roundings, thieves can pass
unnoticed where in mid-term
they w o u l d q u i c k l y arouse
suspicion. M o r a l : look after
your property, and if you see
anything suspicious, phone
College Security immediately.
Apology

unaccountably omitted from the
What's O n column. It's at 1430h
in the G r e a t H a l l , and will
include the election of Queen of

Copy Deadline
The copy deadline for Friday's
F E L I X this week and every
week is 5:30pm on Monday (yes,
today).
Union Cards
T h e r e are two e n o r m o u s
posters on the door of the
F E L I X Office which explain
that this is not the place where
U n i o n c a r d s may be got but
rather that you should visit the
Union Office in the far right
corner of the quad. I am a
patient man, and I sympathise
with engineers who cannot read
a notice three feet away written
in letters six inches high, but if
anyone else asks me 'if this is the
place where you get U n i o n
cards' I W I L L S T R A N G L E

The Phoenix
The Phoenix is the U n i o n ' s
literary magazine, and you'll be
exhorted to contribute to the
Editor, D a v i d Rowe, in due
course. At the Freshers' Fair
The Phoenix's stall is inside the
F E L I X Office (on the right as
you enter Beit Arch) and there
will be free copies of the back
few issues of Phoenix available.
There are also some postgrad
F E L I C E S left, too, if anybody
wants them.
F E L I X Staff
We need anyone and everyone
who has the ability (or would
like to have the ability) to help
produce a weekly newspaper.
We need feature writers, news-
w r i t e r s , r e p o r t e r s , p h o t o -
graphers, film reviewers, theatre
reviewers, paste-up merchants,
artists... in fact, whatever your
talents, and however much or
little time you can offer, it's
pretty certain we can find you
something you'll enjoy. Just
look in at the F E L I X Office
anytime the staff have a few
moments to spare (i.e. not
Wednesday or Thursday after-
noon), introduce yourself to the
Editor, tell him your interests/
abilities and buy him a coffee. If
you're an artist or cartoonist —
both are in great demand — you
could insist that he buys you
one. You'll find we are very
friendly (despite exasperation
with people asking for Union
cards) and working on F E L I X is
one of the most worthwhile ways
to spend some of your free time
at IC.
Paper Rounds
This said, there is one member of
the F E L I X staff who receives
little thanks for his work, and
enjoys none of the camaraderie
as he carries out his apppointed
task. W h o is he? W h y , the
F E L I X delivery man who rises
with the lark (well, before
8:00am) every Friday morning,
and with a cheery smile on his
face and a tune on his lips
delivers four thousand F E L -
ICES to the eagerly awaiting
department messengers. There is
a vacancy for this much-coveted
post; don't all rush at once, but
someone has to do it. ( A l l

gender shall be understood to
embrace the feminine, of course)
