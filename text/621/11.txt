Editorial
A usual edition of F E L I X will
contain a page reserved for news
and information about sport at
IC. How much news and how
much information depends on club
members sending such articles to
F E L I X . As well as match results
and reports, news of tours and
competition results any other
news concerning sport at IC.
Reports of club activities
needn't be just a resume of the
result, who scored, etc, but can be
made more entertaining (witness
last year's football reports). One
thing which would be nice to see
on the sports page is photographs.
Perhaps it is possible for a club
member to take photographs of
club activities and to drop them
into the F E L I X Office. The sports
editor will also try and get out and
about to take some photographs.
An important point concerning
reports is when to hand them in. If
a report is to be published in
Friday's F E L I X then it must be
handed into the F E L I X Office by
the previous Monday at 5:00pm.
Finally, remember that the
quality of the sports page is to a
large extent determined by the
contributions received. Also let's
hope that the sports page can
report sporting successes for clubs
at IC as it has been able to do in
previous years.

Rowing for
Britain
From the Vienna World Rowing
C h a m p i o n s h i p s , I C student
Thomas Anderson sent in this
report.
D u r i n g the summer vacation I
was privileged to be chosen to
row for Great Britain in the
M a t c h des Seniors, the unofficial
Under-23 R o w i n g C h a m p i o n -
ship. This venture was supported
by the U n i o n and College who
both contributed to the costs as
the A R A cannot afford to run an
under-23 team.
The crew consisting of stroke
Thomas Anderson (IC), 3 Nick
H a r t l a n d ( U C ) , 2 G r a h a m Wells
( W L I H E ) , bow Francis Bucknall
( K C ) , travelled to Vienna by
train while the rest of the team
drove, Cambridge towing the
boats.
W e had to practise on the
c o u r s e i n the m o r n i n g a n d
evening as it was over 100Â°F at
midday. O u r race was to be at
11:30 so we tried to get used to
the heat, w h i c h d r a i n e d o u r
energy really quickly. L u c k i l y
there was a slight cooling breeze.
O n the day of the race there
was a strong head wind and it
w a s m u c h c o o l e r . T h e h e a t
w o u l d have suited us but the
wind ruined any chance we had
of a medal as we were a very
light crew.
In the race West G e r m a n y and
France jumped the start and got
a n i n s t a n t e o u s l e a d . W e got
away well and were lying third
pulling away from the Italians in
fourth place and holding the
French in second. The French
eventually got clear of us and we
almost had clear water on the
I t a l i a n s at the 1,000m m a r k
(halfway). F r o m this point on we
were just too light. The stronger
and heavier Italian crew slowly
pulled back at us and eventually
got through and away to take
the bronze medal and leave us in
fourth place. O u r tactics of 'go
out and hang o n ' had been right,
but the opposition just had too
big a weight advantage on the
day.

6th, U L B C Coxless Pair 7th,
Single Sculler 10th.
