So this is FELIX's answer to Time Out-the new detailed guide to
What's On in and around IC, all laid out in chronological order
with wise and witty notes by the FELIX staff. The information in
Roman type (ie not italics) is supplied by whoever places the ad,
and will therefore generally be complimentary towards the band,
film, or whatever, and may be taken with a pinch of salt. Added
comments in italics are supposedly unbiased (if cynical) notes,
but since they are written by FELIX staff, perhaps they also
should be taken with a pinch of salt!
Naturally, FELIX can accept no responsibility for any error,
howsoever caused (ie you can't do me if I cock it up) and this
applies especially this week when I've been given two different
times for at least four events, different days for two others, no
places for others
Hope you like the idea of a detailed What's On. For its success,
of course, it needs society secretaries who can keep to a copy
deadline (5:30 Monday, rigidly enforced) and who are prepared
to write a few words about whatever it is they're promoting. But
with luck it should provide a reliable means of checking up
what's going on at IC and give you a handy reference point when
you forget at the last minute just what time the gig/concert/
party/lecture starts.

- Your chance to hear the Rector
make his usual speech to all
the students who haven't
heard it before. This year's
added gimmick is a warning
against bicycle thieves. After
the Rector, the various Union
hacks introduce themselves;
this year, for the first time, the
FELIX Editor has been allo-
cated a slot which he may or
may not use to make a
speech: You have been
warned..

-If you only attend one event
in Freshers' Week, this is the
one, since on this afternoon
will be decided much of your
social life for the next three
years. All the Union clubs and
societies have stalls and vie
with each other to prove they
are the friendliest/most worth-
while/most interesting/best
society to join. Collect as
much bumf as you can, then
make decisions later when
you have time to think.
Oh yes, and Freshers' Fair
is a thieves' paradise. If it's
yours, hold on to it, and if you
see anything suspicious, report
it. See Editorial.
