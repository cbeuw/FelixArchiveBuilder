ICLUBS & SOCIETIES
Community
Action Group
This club is not as dull as you may think. In
fact, what we set out to do is have fun while
helping others. W e have many projects that
you can help with if you're interested:
The Soup Run
This involves setting out at 11:00pm o n
Tuesdays and Fridays to take soup to the
homeless of London. It's certainly a good way
to meet o t h e r s t u d e n t s i n t h e c r a m p e d
conditions of the minibus and to see London
late at night! If you're interested, don't miss
F r e s h e r s ' S o u p R u n , t o n i g h t . M e e t i n
Falmouth Kitchens at 10:30pm. The minibus
will drop off at the student Halls and Houses at
about 1:00pm. Y o u will be surprised at the
range of people who sleep on the streets.
Acton Youth Club
This takes place on Saturday afternoons for
mentally h a n d i c a p p e d a n d able children.
Basically all you do is play with the children on
the adventure playground, tiring but fun.
Old People
We have two activities involving old people,
visiting them either at an old peoples home off
H i g h S t r e e K e n s i n g t o n a n y d a y o r o n
Wednesday afternoons in one of the wards at
St Pancras Hospital. Sometimes trips are
organised for them and helpers are needed.
Normally you just chat to them or play cards.
B a t t e r e d Wives Home
We help to take the children of these battered
women on trips round London usually at
weekends. The children especially enjoy it
when male students help as they no longer
have a father figure around.
Draught Proofing
Working in conjunction with Age Concern we
send helpers to draughtproof windows of old
peoples houses on Wednesday afternoons.
Most of these projects don't mean a weekly
commitment. W e cater for people who just
want to help when they have the time. Please
come and see us at Freshers' Fair and we'll
give you more details about the projects you're
interested in. If you have any more ideas we
can help you organise it. See you soon!
Hunger Project
Did you know that...
...more people have died as a consequence of
hunger in the past five years than have been
killed in all the wars, revolutions and murders
in the past 150 years.
...28 human beings, 21 of them children, die as
a result of hunger every minute of every hour
of every day; which amounts to fifteen million
people every year.
...this devastation is equivalent to a Hiroshima
every three days.
...and also that if only one seventh of the
world's yearly expenditure o n alcohol and
t o b a c c o or just 1% of the world's yearly
expenditure o n arms, were to allocated to
supporting food self-sufficiency, we could end
world hunger by the end of the century.
In 1977, the National Academy of Sciences
in the U S A published the results of a two-year
study on world hunger conducted with the
assistance of more than 1,500 experts from
around the world. Their report concludes that
"If there is the political will in this country and
abroad...it should be possible to overcome the
worst aspects of widespread hunger a n d
malnutrition within one generation."
A n d will is only found in people. World
hunger will persist so long as people leave the
responsibility with 'others' or 'governments'
etc. The Hunger Project has set about to
generate the will to end world hunger by the
end of this century. T w o million people have
enrolled in the hunger project since it started
in 1977. A n important point to realise is that
every single person makes a difference. Y O U
make a difference. The Hunger Project is
about creating the worldwide commitment
necessary to end world hunger, and this can
only be created throuqh individuals: Y O U .

Hunger Project, or find out what you can do
please contact Clive Harries, M e c h Eng P G ,

Sherfield Lower Refectory.
Debating
The Debating Society offers the opportunity
for students to discuss in a friendly but formal
atmosphere those issues, be they historical or
topical, theoretical or practical which interest
them most.
So if you are interested in debating you can
join the society either at the Freshers' Fair
w h e r e o u r stall will be i n t h e S h e r f i e l d
Refectory, at our first meeting on October 11
or by contacting C Day M E 2 or J Smith
Physics 2.
Mopsoc
The first Mopsoc event of term is the cheese
and wine party, which is held on the first
T h u r s d a y of t e r m , a n d p r o v i d e s a r a r e
o p p o r t u n i t y to meet other students a n d
academic staff in an informal atmosphere.
Entrance is by membership and I look forward
to seeing you there.
STOIC
W h o needs Channel 4 when Imperial College
has its own television station aimed specifically
at students: S T O I C . Not only can you watch
our programmes, you can also help make and
appear in them—try doing that on Channel 4!
In fact, watching S T O I C is childishly simple
children often do. If you tune in on Tuesdays
and Thursdays at 1:00 or 6:00pm by pressing
the S T O I C button on a campus Hall T V set (in
B e i t , G a r d e n , W e e k s , L i n s t e a d , K e o g h -
Falmouth, or Selkirk-Tizard) or just sitting in
the J C R or Southside T V Lounge, then by the
wonder of modern technology (and Woolies)
S T O I C will burst forth.
If you are interested in becoming a m e m b e r
of S T O I C a n d l e a r n i n g about b o t h t h e
t e c h n i c a l a n d n o n - t e c h n i c a l a s p e c t s of
television production, here's a diary of events
to be h e l d in t h e first w e e k s of t e r m .
Remember we neither expect nor require any
previous experience, but if you have any, so
much the better.
Details-of forthcoming programmes will be
advertised on posters around College and in
the F E L I X What's O n column (I never knew
there was so much in it). W h y not tune in to
see us watching you, watching us, reading this.
