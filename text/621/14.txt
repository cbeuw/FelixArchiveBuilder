The Party
T h e Dramsoc Freshers' Party'
traditionally forms a double
bill with 'Dramsoc Auditions'.
More in the mould of Ealing
comedies, it makes Animal
House look barbaric, makes
Oscar Wilde sound witty, and
makes Henley seem refined.
Has a cast of talented
unknowns. Admission free for
first years. _

IC Symphony Orchestra
rehearsing The Planets by
Hoist. T h i s work needs an
orchestra so vast that what-
ever your standard of playing
you're (almost) certain to be
needed; just turn up (with
instrument) and introduce
yourself.

JCR
Guilds present their J C R Party
with live b a n d The Slide,
with live band The Slide.
Admission on the door £1

Union General Meeting (UGM)
This one is ICU's UGM, as
opposed to the CCU UGMs
which were on Monday (see
how easy this initials game
is?). This is rather more
formal, and can get very
tiresome at times. Neverthe-
less, if you make any
pretention at all to being
interested int he social life at
IC, you have some sort of
moral obligation to attend.

IC Choir rehearse Dyson's The
Canterbury Pilgrims
-Don't miss IC Choir just
because you've never heard
of the piece; this is one of
the best non-audition choirs
in London and if you can
cope with their manic over
organisation (direct contrast
with everything else in ICU)
it should not be ignored by
anyone with any enjoyment
of singing choral music.
