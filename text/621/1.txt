Till
Takes
a Trip
A cash till worth £1,200 which
had been stolen from the new
Union Lower Refectory, was sold
in a shop in Brentford for £50.
On Friday September 17 the
College received a telephone call
asking "how their till worked".
The caller had bought the brand
new electronic till for £50 "from
the shop next door", but could
not operate it because the
master-key was not provided.
Seeing the IC logo on the till, he
decided to telephone the College
for the instruction book.
According to Martin Parsons
(Victor Mooney's aide-de-camp)
it was the first the refectory staff
knew about it; apparently the till
could have been stolen any time
since work began refitting the
refectory.
The work was begun in July
and the new till had been left
awaiting installation since then.
Apparently no-one noticed its
absence.
Brentford police have not
revealed the names of the shop
where the till was sold or the
buyer because they are still
investigating.
Sprint to
the Clink
After a dramatic chase through
College, a walk-in thief who had
long been identified, was Anally
captured. The security office had
received several complaints about
this man over the past eighteen
months, and recently he had
actually been observed stealing
the wallet of Adrian Clarke,
librarian of Mines. The thief was

G 'ILLEGAL'
Will Police Turn A Blind Eye?
Imperial College's tradition of opening the year's Rag by playing
tiddlywinks will go ahead on Saturday despite official opposition.
Last year, tiddlywinks raised
over £1,200 in Oxford Street for
the National Deaf Children's
Society. This success, however,
left only pennies for the less
boisterous collections of the
Multiple Sclerosis Society, who
promptly queried the validity of
IC's street collectors' licence.
This year, determined not to be
out-done, they have made a
move against i n d e p e n d a n t
licences being granted on their
flag day. Instead, they are
extending their own licence for
IC students to collect for them
"provided they do not behave
indecorously."!
Undaunted
Unfortunately, the Metro-
politan Police, who had pre-
viously turned a blind eye to the
winking of unlicensed tiddleys,
feel that they must now step in
because M S had o f f i c i a l l y
complained that tifldlywinking
was not covered by the street
licence. According to regula-
tions, collectors must stand
perfectly still and at least twenty-
five metres apart, and the police
have informed the Union that
they will be on the lookout for
people infringing their rules in
Oxford Street.
Not to be daunted, Union
officials have decided to circum-
navigate these technicalities by
re-routing the students to the
King's Road. Can holders and
tiddlywinkers will mass together
to a clicking of counters and a
rattling of cans hoping to collect
as much as possible before their
legality is brought into question
—if, indeed, it is.
F o l l o w i n g t r a d i t i o n , R C S
students will go down the left-
hand side, C & G down the right,
and Mines down the middle of
the road. One participant last
year spoke of tiddlywinking
through a taxi, "but having a bit
of trouble with the ridges in the
rubber carpet." Another student
hopes this year to master
hopping his chip back up the
steps of the tube station.
Prospective tiddlywinkers are
asked to appear in great numbers
at their C C U offices at 9:30 on
Saturday to collect counters and
collecting boxes. Union Presi-
dent Steve Goulder and Rag
Quibbles
Chairman John Ferguson have
stated that they will accept full
responsibility for any legal
quibbles. At the very worst, the
fine could be £25, which will if
necessary be paid from Union
funds; but p r o v i d e d enough
people turn up, they believe that
the police will not intervene.
