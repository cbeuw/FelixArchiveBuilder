H o n o r a r y S c r i b b l i n g s
I have already given you a dose
of moralistic meanderings in my
H a n d b o o k bumph (the rest
makes a useful reference book)
so, especially as Martin wants a
short article, I shall stick to the
practical stuff.
Parking permits: If you want
to try for one, collect an
application form from the Union
Office and return it by 5:30pm
Friday. Permits will be allocated
that weekend.
M o t o r b i k e s : Registration
number should be given to Chief
Security Officer, forty-eight
hours before bringing bike on to
College premises.
Refectories: some outward
improvements have recently
been made to some of tht
refectories. However, because of
the large number of meals
produced, the food is not always
of matching quality. If your food
is inedible, go to the counter and
ask for it to be exchanged; ask
for the Refectory Manager if
necessary. If, after this, you are
still not satisfied, then write out
a complaint and put it in the
suggestions and complaints box
(some are well-hidden and in
Southside, at time of writing, the
box is still in the Upper Refec-
tory; in the Union, the box is in
the Old Refectory). The com-
plaints (and suggestions!) are
looked into by the (wait for it)
'Suggestions and Complaints'
Committee and all those com-
plaints with names and contact
addresses are replied to. In
general, taking the meal back
has more effect on the quality of
service than just complaining
(especially if you do not put in a
written complaint). Positive
suggestions are also needed.
Insurance: All those living in
College accommodation are
covered for certain risks under
the block Halls of Residence
policy. (Note well the exclusion
of clauses such as for theft from
unattended motor vehicles,
records and cassettes worth
more than 10% of the total
cover, bicycles over a certain
value ). C l a i m forms are
a v a i l a b l e f r o m R o o m 438a
Sherfield or myself.
Those not in College accom-
modation are well advised to
take out some insurance. Re-
placing all your possessions (or
even a bag of stolen laundry) is
expensive.
Facilities: around the Union
there are various sporting and
recreational facilities. Some of
the ones you will probably not
be told about are:
Internal Telephones: situtated
in most rooms in the depart-
ments, on Halls of Residence
landings, in the Union Building,
in the bar, etc. Useful for getting
your friend to come down and
open the Hall door after it has
been locked for the night, or even
telephoning Nightline (int 2468,
ext 581-2468) to find out the
time of the last tube or for advice
on more serious problems. Some
useful telephone numbers are
printed on your Unioncard.
Typewriter: there is a manual
typewriter in the IC U n i o n
Office which anyone is welcome
to use. Important letters from
clubs and societies can occasion-
ally be done by Pat, our Union
T y p i s t , but see me first. I
generally give her most of her
typing and consequently know
how busy she is likely to be.
Gestetner: for large amounts
of bumph the U n i o n Office
gestetner can be used. We have
currently got three other ges-
tetners, but no-one is willing to
have a go at fixing them
Offset-Litho: the Union Print
Unit (based in the F E L I X Ofice)
offers facilities for quality
printing at cheaper than average
rates (currently, for example,
l ' / 2 P per A3 sheet and £2.50 per
H a l f - p r i c e
S t u d e n t
r a i l t r a v e l
Save lots of money with a Young Persons Railcard. Anyone under 24
can buy one (students in full time education can be older). It costs £10
and is valid for 12 months from the date of purchase.
The Card entitles you to 5 0 % ofT 2nd Class Ordinary Single, Ordinary
and Awayday Returns. M i n i m u m Student fares of £3 Ordinary Single or
Awayday Return and £6 Ordinary Return apply except on Saturdays,
Sundays and Bank Holidays and on any day during July and August
when the 5 0 % fare reduction applies to all journeys.
Whether you're nipping home to see the folks, popping down to
L o n d o n , day tripping to the coast, or exploring the countryside a
Railcard gets you to where you want to go and lets you keep half
the money i n the bargain.
It also saves 5 0 % on most Sealink journeys to and from the Channel
Islands, the Irish Ports, the Isle of M a n , and on through rail/ship
journeys to and from the Isle of W i g h t .
It's the way to travel and have lots of fun without having lots of money.
For further information and full details, pick up a leaflet from your
university or college travel office or from principal British R a i l stations.
This is the age of the train
printing plate and typesetting
and paste-up charges).
Sewing: an electric sewing
machine is available for use in
the Union Office. Members of
Dramsoc also have access to a
rather temperamental industrial
sewing machine—though they
urgently need someone who is
willing to use it (and who shall
be accorded the title of 'Ward-
robe Mistress' or 'Wardrobe
Master' accordingly).
Perhaps our most useful asset
is information, mainly available
from those two pillars of the
Union, Jo, the receptionist, and
Jen the Union Administrator. It
doesn't take much shoe leather
or dialling finger and we do not,
usually, bite—though we might
be a bit busy at times so you
might have to wait a while.
Back to the moralistic bit as I
trot out the usual cliche of
"welcome to our College". Your
course might be boring or hard
but do not give up on it too
easily and return home (the first
two weeks are always the worst
for homesickness), try talking to
someone else; they are probably
as nervous as you
See you at the first IC U G M at
1:00pm on Thursday.
Take care.

Making Your Will
A number of you will leave your coats on the backs
of chairs with wallet in pocket; will leave your
handbag beside your chair; will leave your
valuables in unlocked drawers; will carry your
cheque book and card together; will leave your
room unlocked while you nip along to the shower;
will wander around the library leaving your goodies
on the desk and you will have them stolen.
Do come and report it to us. We promise not to
say we told you so, but
We told you so.
