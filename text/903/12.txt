Canoeing
After finishing last term with a successful
surfing trip to Scrunge in Wales, on the
first day of the vacation the canoe club
set off for its second, traditional, Easter
tour to Scotland—a small country in the
North of England.
On the Saturday night, after a twelve
hour drive, both vehicles miraculously
arrived at our first week's accommodation
in Invermoriston, on the edge of Loch
Ness.
After a good night's sleep, we set off on
a gentle warm-up paddle to the river
Spey. Over the first few days the troops
progessed in difficulty, allowing the
novices present to build up their
confidence and also take advantage of
numerous swimming opportunities. The
paddling was good, but unfortunately our
choice of rivers was limited as, unusually
for Scotland, there was no bloody water!
After a sightseeing trip to Skye, we
then moved our base South West to Loch
Awe—an area containing a number of
meaty rivers. Needless to say that by this
time we were praying for rain and
amazingly our prayers were answered;
unfortunately whoever was listening was
just a tad over zealous, and all the rivers
rose about five feet overnight, and most
were deemed unsafe to paddle for the
rest of the week. We therefore had to
reassess the situation, and most of us
were limited to a day trip on the Loch
and also to paddling a one mile stretch of
the river Orchy—just for the sake of it.
Some of the more experienced paddlers
decided to risk life and limb on some of
the 'safer' raging torrents.
Despite the disappointing conditions,
everyone enjoyed the trip, and plans are
afoot for next year's tour—possible to the
Ardeche.
Meanwhile we regularly go on weekend
trips to such places as Wales and Devon;
anyone who would like to give canoeing
a try is welcome to come along to an
introductory pool sesson on a Tuesday
evening.
Snooker
Over the Easter recess, someone broke
into the Snooker room and took 2 and a
half sets of snooker balls. For this reason,
the Snooker club has been unable to.,
open as usual. So if anyone out there
knows anything about the theft please get
in touch with any member of the Snooker
Committee. If the thief himself were to
return the balls, it would be greatly
appreciated, and no further action will be
considered.
Boat Club
Last Friday, the Boat Club's First Eight
represented the College at Henley
Regatta in Japan, racing against forteen
other University crews. Over 1,600
metres of the Sumida River in Tokyo. IC
dominated the first heat of the
competition, finishing well clear of the
field, which included Melbourne
University. The final was an epic one; IC
were led off the start, but rowed through
the opposition to win by nine seconds.
Nippon University were runners-up,
Durham University a close third, with
Waseda University from Tokyo fourth.
The result came as a huge relief to the
crew, who had overcome an eight hour
time difference, difficulties in rigging a
borrowed boat, a strong headwind and a
very rough river. The racing was shown
live on Japanese TV and the crew
acquired celebrity status in the eyes of a
large crowd. Japan was suitably
impressed by the professionalism of
Imperial College Boat Club.
UAU Cricket
UCL vs IC Saturday 4th May
1st XI
IC lost by 1 run
After a delayed start due to a wet pitch,
IC put UCL in to bat having won the toss.
Thanks to some excellent bowling by
John Mottashed, who took 6 wickets, UCL
were bowled out shortly after lunch for
133.
Imperial started badly, and slumped to
50-5 by tea. After tea, IC captain, Mike
Anderson, set about rescuing the position
with typical gritty determination. He was
finally out lbw having scored 43 runs and
having been dropped at least 3 times. It
was left to the last two batsmen to try to
score the winning runs. Unfortunately
after a nailbiting finish, IC were all out
for 132, which severely reduces the
chances of the 1st XI's chances of going
through to the next round.
2nd XI
IC win by 8 wickets
Once again IC won the toss and put UCL
in. After under twenty overs UCL were
all back in the pavilion having just scored
29 runs. This rout was mainly due to Rup
Ranerjee, who took five wickets including
a hatrick finishing with figures of 9-3-11-5,
and being ably supported by Steve
Everton.
IC quickly scored the runs to win, with
Gunni Dhahyalla scoring 22 n.o. A beer
match was them hastily organised due to
the match finishing so quickly. UCL were
sadly thrashed again. "It's like taking
candy from children" observed one
umpire!
