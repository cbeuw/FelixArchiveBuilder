Rag Fete T o m o r r o w
Seeing as most of you will be reading this
during your first lecture on Friday, let's
have some fun. Hands up all those who
know what Rag Fete is. (Alright hands
down as the lecturer's wondering what
mistake s(h)e's just made.)
Well for those of you who don't, it's
that one afternoon in May when
everyone takes a break from their intense
study (or procrastinates a bit more if they
haven't got down to it yet) and enjoys
themselves at the College's Annual Fete.
Taking over the whole of Prince's
Gardens on Saturday 11th May between
2pm and 5pm it's already promising to be
much better than last year!

worth over £600. these include eight
different meals for two, Levi 501s, wines,
spirits and books. With the top prize of a
£50 travel voucher. The draw for this
great raffle will be near the end of the
fete and tickets will be available
throughout for only 50p.
To close the fete the Civil Aviation

to release over 400 balloons across
London in a huge balloon race. Entry for
this will be at the fete.
Unicef Karaoke
In the evening of the Rag Fete Unicef will
be holding a Karaoke night in the Union
Lounge Bar from 9pm to midnight. This
will give all you budding stars a chance
to perform and the rest of us a chance to
sit and have a good laugh at your
expense. It's only two quid (£2.00) on the
door, though tickets will also be available
at the Rag Stall during the Fete.
See you there and have fun.
