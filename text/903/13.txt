Scribblers' Corner
Doppelgangers, Rock and Bitching
Dear Andy,
Further to BJ's letter of FELIX 900
(some time ago, but then undergrads
have holidays to counterbalance the
nausea of exams, therefore no FELIX), I
couldn't agree more although I think the
male:female ratio pales into insignificance
next to the too much beermot too much
beer ratio; there may be only 1000
biologically female specimens at IC but
there are six million in London, so you'll
just have to try a bit harder. Anyway,
back to the point; shortly after the
publications of BJ's enormously
meritworthy missive, his twin brother and
the doppelgangers of a number of his
ents cronies entered the RockSoc gig in
the lounge without paying and proceeded
to hijack the disco, and indeed the rest of
the event, while under the influence of
alcohol. Does BJ have a twin brother? I
think we should be told?
Yours sincerely,
Jan Graham, MEPG.
PS By way of precluding counter-
argument, I accept that the members of
IC RockSoc are not worthy of normal
human consideration, since it is possible
that some of them may listen to Heavy
Metal (Uuuuuurgh!) rather than the sort of
great music that normally gets reviewed
on the music pages of FELIX.
PPS I thought that gigs in the Union
were banned for the summer term
(presumably to remove temptation from
Beit Hall residents); this certainly applies
to RockSoc, although obviously not to
Ents. Whoops, I forgot, see PS (above).
Stress, Drugs, and Real Life
Dear Editor
Dr Raanan Gillon runs a health centre
for a college (our college) where the
environment is highly competitive and
stress levels particularly high. I was
therefore amazed at his comments in the
Evening Standard (FELIX 901)—that
betablockers should be available to any
students suffering from exam stress.
Nearly everyone suffers from it. What is
the criteria for diagnosing who should
receive drugs? Or is Dr Gillon suggesting
they be freely available?
People have to cope with stress in
every aspect of life, whether academic,
job-related or in their relationships with
other people, and learning how to do it is
part of what college is all about. If
students feel that college is not giving
them the help and support they need to
learn how to cope naturally, then
something is going wrong. There will
always be a minority for whom the
prescription of betablockers is medically
justifiable in the short-term. But
abnormally high levels of anxiety usually
indicate the need for long-term help, such
as counselling, to uncover the underlying
problem.
What worries me is that Dr Gillon's
remarks highlight a lack of an alternative.
Often, stress needs an outlet—someone
who will listen to fears and worries, and
help students build the confidence to cope
with anxiety. Perhaps if counsellors were
more widely available, it would alleviate
the need for students to feel that
prescription is the only way out.
