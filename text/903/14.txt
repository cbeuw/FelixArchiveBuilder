Okay, time for some explanations. The last
two issues have been rather light-weight at
only 12 pages. This was due to me having
an exam at the end of the first week of
term, and last week the paper suppliers
didn't. This week Felix is creeping back up
to the 20 pages I had planned as a regular
size for this term, and only missed it
because of the Bank Holiday. I apologise
for the smaller sizes, but what with exams
and circumstances beyond my control,
we're having to work on a very week-by-
week basis.
Here we go. Again.
Speaking of week-by-week, that seems to
be the way the Rector works as well.
One week he seems to have got the
message that virtually no-one wants the
College day to be extended by starting at
a silly time and finishing at a silly time,
and that the proposal just isn't justifiable,
and the next week he's decided to ignore
all that, and try to go ahead with it
anyway.
So, I'm afraid that we may have to go
through the whole farcical scenario again.
So for your own sakes, and those of any
future students at IC, if another EGM or
survey is called, get involved and stop
His Rectorness from running rampant
through the structure of our college, and
show him that he can't just change
anything he wants just because he wants
to. Even if he really really wants to.
Money, Money, Money...
At about this time of year some of the
Greater Gods of College use their near
infinite wisdom to decide on next years
rents for college accommodation. Of
course, as they haven't officially released
them yet we'll all have to wait until next
week to see what they're going to be.
However, as they've been steadily going
up for at least the last two years, it seems
likely that this trend could continue,
especially when you consider that the
accommodation sector of college has
debts amounting to around £20.5 million,
and it seems that they expect the
students to pay this off. That seems fair
to me. After all, the Estates Director,
Gordon Marshall, refused to make any
comment about the possibility that bad
management was to blame for the debt,
and said that the purchase of the
Clayponds site was a 'very good move',
despite the fact that it, combined with the
overall bungling of the Montpelier sale, is
directly responsible for a large proportion
of this debt. And he must be right. Of
course, I could be wrong, and rents might
just go up by the 10.5% called for by
inflation. Anyone want to give me some
odds?

Felix needs you!
Okay guys and gals, it's summer term and people
are trying to get some work done. This leaves us
a bit short of material.
So, if you've ever wanted fame, fortune and your
name in print, now's your chance!
