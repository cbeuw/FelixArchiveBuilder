AS GOOD AS IT GETS
Starring: Jack Nicholson, Helen Hunt, Cuba G o o d i n g Jr
Director:|ames L Brooks • • • •
A
romantic lead w h o suffers
from obsessive-compulsive
disorder must be a first for
Hollywood, but that is the situation
in the excellent As Good As It Gets.
Jack Nicholson never uses a bar of
soap more than once and always
switches the light o n and off exact-
ly five times before feeling comfort-
able. A n acerbic-tongued romantic
novelist, Nicholson takes pride in
his ability to condescend, offend
and w o u n d . First introduced to the
audience as an "animal-hater", w h o
disposes of his neighbour's d o g
down the trash chute, he s o o n
reveals himself to also be a racist,
h o m o p h o b e , misogynist... In
short, this man is abhorrent and will
no doubt offend many sections of
the audience.
There is only one person in the
world w h o can tolerate Nicholson's
sarcastic tirades. Helen Hunt is a
waitress w h o works in Jack's
favourite cafe and has a special
relationship with the dysfunctional
loner. This is enhanced when he
pays for hospital treatment for her
asthmatic son and soon this flash
of generosity has surprising conse-
quences on all around.
O n c e again Jack N i c h o l s o n
proves himself to be one of the
best actors in Hollywood today.
O n e of the few individuals w h o
could handle such a complex role,
he delivers it with great conviction
and deservingly w o n a G o l d e n
Globe Award for best actor this
year. It will be a travesty if he fails
to make it a third Oscar as well in a
couple of weeks.
Last seen in the 1997 summer
blockbuster Twister, Helen Hunt

THE THIRD MAN
"Fresh each time you see it - this
film has no sell-by date"
Barry N o r m a n
ICU Cinema's next free Sunday
show is one of the greatest British
films of all time. The Third Film is
one of those rare films that has had
an irrevocable effect not just on the
art of film but also on society as a
whole. Set amidst the torn remains
of post-war Vienna this is a mixture
of film noir, suspense and action
thriller, with a vicious comic lilt.
A m e r i c a n pulp writer Joseph
Cotton arrives in the Austrian capi-
tal only to discover that the friend
who waited for him (Orson Welles)
has been killed under strange
circumstances. H e then sets out
like a sleuth from a second rate
novellette to uncover the killer.
The a w a r d - w i n n n i n g cine-
matography, sarcastic script and
haunting music create a complete
film. John
Jack Nicholson plays the vicious (but funny) Melvin
date in this film. M a t c h i n g
Nicholson with a Golden Globe and
Oscar nomination, hers is the only
straightforward character in the
film, yet she gives such an endear-
ing performance that she avoids
dissappearing behind Nicholson's
on-screen antics.
All in all, this might not be quite
as g o o d as cinema gets, but it is
certainly a refreshingly intelligent
character-driven c o m e d y w h i c h
deserves its seven Oscar
nominations. U Choon
WAG THE DOG
Starring: Dustin Hoffman, Anne
Heche, Robert De Niro
Director:Barry Levinson
• • • y2
Wag the Dog is a satirical
look into how the media
and the American public
can be controlled and deceived by
smart thinking and a big budget.
The film stars Robert De Niro as a
fast thinking and talking spin doc-
tor brought in to revive the
A m e r i c a n President's reputation
when, less than t w o weeks before
election day, a scandal erupts and
threatens to cripple the bid for a
second term. Anticipating the press
attention, De Niro creates a bigger
story, a war. With the help of
Dustin H o f f m a n , a,successful film
producer, he brings together a
range of unlikely people together
to orchestrate a global conflict to
rival any H o l l y w o o d production.
The combination of De Niro
and Hoffman's smart thinking pro-
duces a cascade of events, that get
more and more outrageous and
daring, in the effort to last out the
1 1 days before the polls open.
There are great performances
from both the leading actors as the
two characters keep playing off
each other in order to keep deceiv-
ing the press, the public and the
CIA. The film has a very topical plot
with the scenario being not entirely
dissimilar to that being faced by
President Clinton involving the
alleged sex scandal and the Gulf
war.
All in all, this is a clever film
worth watching for its outrageous,
yet quite believable, plot and the
quality performances. D
