he Lilys burst onto the music
scene in a tried and tested
way to success with their
song Nanny in Manhatten being
featured in a recent Levis ad in
which s o m e fifties kids drive
around in a c o n v e r t e d hearse,
spreading love a n d flowers to
everyone. This gave the Lilys limit-
ed success in the sin-
gles chart with one of
the lowest charting
Levis songs ever, fol-
lowing the likes of
Boombastic, Inside and
Spaceman all former
number ones. The Lilys
have n o w c o m p l e t e d
an album, but can it
compete with the qual-
ity of their previous sin-
gle? A n d are they as fifties as all
that?
The a l b u m has been m a d e
purely to recreate the fifties as
much as possible. Hours of editing
time was spent trying to recreate
all of the 'zestful tangents and
quirky swoons and squeaks' of the
era. It is all very impressive in
terms of h o w well this is achieved,
but after the first few songs, it
b e c o m e s incredibly annoying. You
spend almost the whole time ,
while listening to the album just
wanting them to snap out of it and
to get with the times.
The Lilys have seemed to have
taken a completely normal set of
tunes, which don't seem to have
any plan to them in terms of direc-
tion, start or finish and
then just put in a lot of
sickly harmonies a n d
weird bits and have hoped
that the because it is so
reminiscent everyone will
jump on the band wagon,
forgetting that to d o this
there must be some talent
there. It's almost as if the
beach boys were singing
baba blacksheep in a
A m e r i c a n singing the National
A n t h e m for five minutes trying to
get as many extra notes in as pos-
sible type way and it doesn't work.
This album has been greeted
arms wide open by the Maker and
N M E , but unless y o u are a fifties
kid, from that great era that no-one
raves about or even talks about
musically stay away.CI

T
his collection of live tracks,
out-takes and classic tracks
was released last December.
Due to popular d e m a n d , it was re-
launched about a month ago and is
just about one of the most c o m -
prehensive and well-made boxed
sets ever. It really does justice to
the band whose career was cut
short tragically w h e n their lead
singer, Ian Curtis, committed sui-
cide. The band formed in 1977 as
a result of the punk explosion but
they didn't create thrashy guitar
noise like the Sex Pistols or the
Buzzcocks; instead they made a
kind of moody, bass-led drone that
reflected their goth tendencies and
would go on to influence a multi-
tude of bands . Singer Ian Curtis'
lyrics were depressing and sung
with a kind of monotpony that
would normally have been boring -
he, however, made them worth lis-
tening to.
Heart and Soul contains
extended versions of two of their
studio albums, U n e x p e c t e d
Pleasures and Closer as well as a
C D of rarities and out-takes and a
fourth C D of live recordings. The
first two of these are an interesting
set of records. Unexpected
Pleasures was initially released in
1979 and was a defining moment
in the band's history and some
would say that it was their best
album. It could be said that adding
new tracks to a classic album
would make it worse because it
contains those tracks that the band
never wanted o n it. The counter-
argument is that, as a listener or
fan, this set of new songs extends
the journey that Heart and Soul
takes y o u o n .
Closer Plus carries on adding
new tracks and contains the song
that everyone, whether or not they
have heard any other Joy Division
tracks, has heard Love Will Tear Us
Apart. The Rarities C D shows the
biggest transformation, though.
Here, it is obvious to see how the
band developed from their early
punk side to late gothic, while the
live C D is a testament to Ian Curtis'
talent. In such a small space, it is
difficult to say m u c h more about an
album that deserves to be in any
self-respecting music fan's collec-
tion. Get it. Tell your friends to get
it. Get it. Get it? C!

Pulp - This Is Hardcore
If they're trying to shed their Common People
sound, they've done an amazingly convincing
job of it. Sleaziness is the key here, plus an
attempt at epic-ness without quite managing to
pull it off. Even if y o u didn't rate C o m m o n
People, you'll be hard pressed to reckon this is
much cop.

Bernard Butler - Not Alone
Can you remember the epitome of poppiness
and class that is Yes, which had Bernard part-
nered with M c A l m o n t . This track is nearly up
there in the same category of quality. It is both
uplifting and intensely catchy, and it promises
much for his forthcoming album.
Therapy? - Church of Noise
This is a change from what y o u would normally
expect to hear from Therapy. It is quite quirky
and much more p o p p y than their usual heavy
thrash (Teethgrinder), and it's not a distorted
guitar headlong rush c o m m o n to their last
album. A very disappointing comeback release.
Willliam - Tired of Fucking
What a load of trash. This sounds like the former
Jesus &. M a r y Chain member William Reid has
just gone into a studio and started strumming
his guitar. If you want to know what lo-fi is, just
give this a listen. Any fans of the J8JV1 Chain w h o
might get this record, get it for the B-sides
which are only slightly better.
Portishead - Only You
Typically Portishead, but lacking any real hook-
line to reel the listener in. Depressing as expect-
ed but there is nothing exciting happening here,
unlike previous releases such as Glory Box.

Black Crape - Marbles
N o one's really sure whether Black Grape still
exist or not. O n e thing's for certain, songs from
their latest album lack the same drug-addled
lunacy of It's Great When You're Straight, Yeah!
Marbles is g o o d though, saved from the asylum
by the hyper-bollocks line, 'I know you swapped
a kidney for a stone / Well I saw you swap a kid-
ney for a 'phone.'
Radiator - Resistor
You're first hit by the pounding backing section
whose beats are so rhythmic they could almost
have been recorded backwards. Then it's a con-
stant battle between a scary voice repeatedly
shouting the words 'Arise' and 'Resistor' like
some kind of futuristic dictator; and a heartfelt
melody of 'I've been so aroused'. Gets you jiv-
ing.
Streem - Coming Down
Clearly influenced by both Bowie and Republica
(and even M o n a c o in places), Streem are on a
journey to the M o o n . So they might as well
make some pleasing music on the way. Beware:
on occasions they sound a bit like mainstayers
Babylon Z o o . But don't let that put you off.

Mainstream - Step Right Up
Recent N u d e signings M a i n s t r e a m probably
chose their name as an escape clause, in case
they ever got called unoriginal. Don't worry
though. This song is amazing. O K , so the voice
is classic Tim Burgess with a sprinkling of Ian
Brown. Alright, the chorus is H a p p y M o n d a y s -
esque with its jumpable 'Step Right U p , c ' m o n
now, Step Right U p ' refrain. A n d , agreed, the
sound is Baggy with not-out-of-place flute flour-
ishes. The fact remains. You'll love it!
Glamourous Hooligan - Stoned Island Estate
An uplifting mixture of big beat and political reg-
gae with an old style 'happy hardcore' pulse
running through it. The lyricist obvious;y feels
passionately about his subject but there seems
to be lacking in this song, which would probably
sound best whilst clubbing. CI
