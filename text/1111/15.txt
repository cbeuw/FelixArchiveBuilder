COMPETITION
STATE OF THE NU-ART VOL.2 (BluePIanet Rec)
S
tate Of The Nu-Art are back
bigger and better than
before, and five of you have
got the chance to win, not only
State of the Nu-art Vol.2 but
you'll also get a copy of Vol.1.
For those of y o u that don't w i n
now get a double C D or quadruple
vinyl for your money. Blueplanet
records coming out of Germany
have gathered together a compre-
hensive collection of works, cover-
ing all styles of electronic music
(hip-hop, downbeat, funky dub,
up-tempo cyber-funk, techno and
drum 'n' bass). This all adds up to a
highly original, deep and extremely
funky album.
CD. 1 Digital Truth, get the jour-
ney underway with s m o o t h strings,
a sample from what sounds like
War of the Worlds, down tempo
beats and some ruff scratching.
These C D s aren't mixed but you
hatdly notice as they are so well
arranged, real cohesion between
tracks they just roll into one anoth-
er. Paradox-Daylight Robbery is a
track that I instantly fell in love
with, a vocal sample most should
recognise, that works so so well
with the rugged 'n' raw beats.
Blackbean sauce-Sfrefc/? is an
out ' n ' out rap hip-hop as is The
Next Wavelength but in a totally
different style. It is amazing the
amount of styles featured here,
showing the true strength in depth
this music has.
Also out standing tracks by
M u n g - L a Cream da la Cream
superb bendy bass tone and the
way the track builds is pure genius.
Marc Williams-T/ie Return of the
Prodigal Son raises the t e m p o with
a intelligent, funky rolling drum ' n '
bass track, wicked horns, cool film
sample and hard ' n ' fast chopping
beats. The final three tracks keep
with the drum 'n' bass licks.
The second is more deep tech-
no orientated often with a down
t e m p o pace, with tracks by artists
such as Air Liquid, Jammin' Unit,
Dr. Walker, and Atomic Dog.
This is music for the mind,
music for the thinking man/woman.
Where every track has been made
for the love of the music, not c o m -
mercial gain. Where every single
break ' n ' beat is there for a reason,
meticulous attention to detail. A n d
I positive many many hours were
spent programming these essential
pieces of listen to perfection. With
tracks covering every sub-genre of
electronic music I can think of and
then some.
A treat for the musical con-
noisseur and the open minded.
Now to win your very own
copy of not only vol.2, but vol.1
as well is tell me what country
BluePIanet records are coming
out of: A. Finland
B. Wales
C. Germany.

The Man Behind The Music
T
his debut album from John B
is again in that jazz D&J5
fusion style which is c o m i n g
on strong recently. You get t w o
CDs (Organic cover the jazz experi-
ence and Synthetic which covers
more normal D&B) or a very nice
vinyl box set for your money.
C D 1 . Organic is a full on jazz
D&£ affair that I have to say is con-
CLUBSCENE - ALBUMS
structed superbly, with John classi-
cal training shining through the
productions, which ate full of funk.
The jazz influences are very
prominent, but not so much as to
put off an open minded drum &.
bass fan. Some of the inspired
pieces of work are jazz Sessions 2.
I've never heard a trumpet sound
so g o o d , and it sound as if it could
be recreated using live just instru-
ments ? but still tetains a very funky
jacking drum bass track. Slam
Funk (moog mix) and Jazz Sessions
1, a awesome college of beats and
live instruments and when it drops
in you know all about it. Future funk
in full effect.
C D 2 . Synthetic is described as
a harder analogue tip which is just
standard drum &. bass to you and
me. By that I do not mean to imply
unoriginal ot not cutting edge
material, but unlike the first C D it
doesn't exploring just one style to
the max.
This C D is mixed to perfection
combining ten tracks all created by
the one man. Starburst sets off
with an intro that could be from
Chariots of Fire then it pans out to
be a top notice roller. This is one of
the things I love about D8J5 is that
their are no rules, you can use any
sound or sample y o u like as long as
it works.
This is so impressive, it could
be a standard set y o u ' d hear in a
club or mixed C D you would never
guess that all this is one mans work
as each track is so different and so
strong, there's no real running
theme. W h e n y o u think about it
most other D8J3 albums being
released to date are ether a compi-
lation of various artists, or feature a
lot of remixed old material as well
as new. Very few single artist
albums have featured 21 tracks
with the majority being totally new
material. The man is a genius.
So many styles are covered
here. The jazz element being
explored to the outer limits, dark
menacing numbers, futuristic step-
pers, intelligent crazy kutt up break
beats. So by the looks of it this is
one of those must have pieces of
work, that'll be talked about and
played for years to c o m e . JP
GARAGE DRUM 'IM' RASS
H Life Feat. Da Scat Cat.
Lifeguard
(Suth Based Prod.) Mid March.
It's been awhile since the last
release from the fairly new Hi-Life,
and this latest offering could well
put them centre stage, with the
recent trend towards "The S m o o t h
Groove". With theit trademark
soulful licks, sub-bass tones, clever
keys and those powerful vocals
from Da Scat Cat it's sure to be big
in the clubs. With mixes to suit dub
monsters and classic vocal styles.
RBM. Strong Loving EP.
(Ripe n' Ready) Out Now.
Quality vocal and dub/speed
garage mixes on this one. The
beats ' n ' bass roll along behind
prominent keys and a fine female
vocal on the more vocal mixes. The
one I've been playing is the
dubby/speed mix, where the rolls
are reversed, strong solid beats,
stabs of keys and a cut ' n ' looped
vocal with a sub-bass that is worth
the wait. Guaranteed to keep the
floor moving, but the vocal can be
a bit repetitive and annoying on
heavy listening.
Primary Motive. Venom /S
(Creative Source) Mid march
Smooth c h o p p e d up beats roll and
build over what sounds like under-
water atmosphericals and whale
calls 'n' sonar sounds, then in
drops the deep bass tones, c o m -
pleting the seascape in your mind.
The imaginatively titled S has very
cleverly arranged beats, difficult to
explain with dreamy keys and
atmos. and suttle touches of sax
and ahh ahh female vocal blend
into the beats. Another first class
offering from this label that never
ceases to impress me.
Chemical Pilot. (Eruption)
Astral Dominoes (mixes) March.
You get remixes by Decoder, Matt
Schwarz and Profound Noize, all
to a very different end results.
Decoders mix give it a Krust sort of
full length roll out, nice use of
morse code sounds, tough beats
with an un-intrusive dark wah wah
bassline. M a t t mix is much more in
ya face, fast hectic beats, time-
stretches. Profound Noize funk up
the beats, strong bassline. If you
like a touch of darkness now 'n'
then, and something a little differ-
ent it's well worth hunting down.
