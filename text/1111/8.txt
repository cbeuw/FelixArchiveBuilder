COLUMNS 3 March 1998
When I first heard about this
Wye College 'merger' a couple of
months ago, I was puzzled, as I
was last Friday. What, I pon-
dered, does Imperial College,
one of the leading universities in
Britain, want with a tin pot acad-
emy for apprentice carrot
crunchers from minor public
schools? A combination of too
many late nights and an exces-
sive study of the fine ales of
Southside meant that I was
being very naive. There is only
one reason in the world why IC
would want Wye. '350 hectares in
Ashford, Kent.' That would be the
Ashford that is close to the
Channel Tunnel rail link, I pre-
sume. For anyone who still
thinks that some deluded soul in
the upper echelons of the
College sees academic benefits
from this, let me reassure you
that this is simply good, old
fashioned asset stripping. When
the link is built, land in the prox-
imity will skyrocket in value as
the world and his wife descend
on Kent. Provided Wye College's
land is not covered by ancient
rules that prevent resale or rede-
velopment, something we nearly
always fall foul in these situa-
tions, Imperial could make a for-
tune. For their part, Wye gets to
trade in their
Ford Fiesta
degree for a Qj
Bentley-esque

It almost /"Y*>
sounds too
good to be
true. In the
past, such
wonder deals C _
have been.
Please let this iy)
cynical old
scribe be
wrong.
In recent times, the Royal Family
seem to have been under a
relentless pressure to reform.
This drive has supposedly come
from 'the people', who apparent-
c
o
ly wish to see a much reduced
monarchy that is far cheaper to
run than the current arrange-
ment. For the most part, this is
rubbish. The supposed desire for
reform stems principally from
poisonous, trouble-making thugs
on Fleet Street,
f a b r i c a t i n g
rather than
(C*} reporting the
ly} n a t i o n a l
debate. With
f""t* the proposals
~J that the Queen
f*^ has been forced
to present, we
["""1 run the risk of
' I
T
- m a
k m
S the
Royal Family so
i I ordinary and
i n s i g n i f i c a n t
that its very existence comes into
question. The cost issue is par-
ticularly galling. After the
changes of the last few years, the
Civil List is now limited to Her
Majesty, the Duke of Edinburgh
and the Queen Mother; those
who used to receive payments
are now supported by the Queen
directly. Moreover, when one
considers that the Queen and
Prince Charles pay income tax
and that surplus income from
the Crown Estates are given to
the Treasury, the idea that we
cannot afford the status quo is
ludicrous, a malicious slur by
those who seek to attack the
great institutions of state. Such
penny-pinching is not only dam-
aging to the monarchy, but por-
trays an image of Britain as a
spent force to the rest of the
world. We have already had the
Britannia fiasco, which, for a
maritime nation, was deeply
humiliating. To cut further the
expenditure on our head of state,
at a time when government
offices are being refurbished at
exorbitant cost, is outrageous
and must be stopped.
