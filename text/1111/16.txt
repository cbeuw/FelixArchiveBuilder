CLUBSCENE - COMPILATIONS
the eheetne cafie
Hello and w e l c o m e to another edition of the
Electric Cafe. H o p e you're all doing well. H o t on
the heels of the M r C interview last week, look
out for forthcoming features o n the stars of
German electronic music, including interviews
with Fauna Flash, w h o have been creating
Shockwaves on the international drum'n'bass
scene; M i c h a e l Reinboth, w h o owns Germany's
coolest experimental electronic/jazz label
C o m p o s t Records and also DJs regularly at
venues such as the Blue N o t e in L o n d o n ; and
also Ingmar Koch from Air Liquide, w h o have
produced some of my finest techno moments
and also c o m m a n d lots of respect in the under-
ground scene.
Firstly, I wanted to thank everyone w h o
came d o w n to the first ever Electric Cafe music
night a couple of Thursdays ago. It really was an
event that transformed Southside disco. The
atmosphere was very friendly and relaxed. I
think the concept of making it into another
drinking area where y o u can chill out and chat
to people worked really well. I played from 7 p m
to 1 1 p m , and a whole range of musical styles
were covered.
If you couldn't make it to the last one, we
are going to make these a regular feature at
Southside. The next one will be on Thursday
19th M a r c h (in less than a week).
You may remember that 1 was talking about
a club called Analog City in my column a couple
of weeks ago. It actually took place last week-
end on Saturday 7th M a r c h at The C a m d e n
Island Market. I was lucky enough to be able to
check out the event for myself. After taking a lot
of stick, techno has been going through a bad
patch lately. DJ Craig Thomas and his friends
decided to put on this event to prove once and
for all that techno is not dead, and is as musi-
cally significant as any other style present today.
First of all, I have to say that I was really
impressed with the venue. The C a m d e n Island
Market is very clean and spacious. The design
and layout was interesting as both dance floors
are connected and y o u have to pass through
onreto get to the other. S o m e h o w this wasn't a
problem and I never felt jostled or c r a m p e d . It
could have been nice to have a better chill-ouit
area, but that is just a minor niggle!
Arriving soon after midnight, I found the
place was still warming up. This was going to be
a long night! The concept of the club was to get
as many DJs as possible to play for a set amount
of time. The idea was to keep a varied and fresh
sound throughout the night. 1 think that this
worked. I thought beforehand that an hour-long
set would be too short for many DJs, but 1 d o
respect Craig for trying a new concept that goes
against the grain. Giving each DJ a deadline to
spark off the crowd led to a sense of urgency in
many sets. There were no long build-ups, each
spinner got straight to the point and really let
the music do the talking.
Two rooms were pumping out the grooves
all night. The back room was the perfect setting
for complete techno mayhem. Very minimal and
rhythmic. The setting was dark and smokey. The
music was g o o d if y o u like hard techno. James
Ruskin did an admirable job, pounding the
crowd into a frenzy. However, player of the
night in the main r o o m had to be Craig Thomas.
This was his night, and I was in awe of his set.
It was by far the funkiest thing to hit that r o o m
allnight, yet it didn't compromise the atmos-
phere or loose the crowd at all.
The music represented in the other r o o m
was the housier side of techno. Some very
rhythmic and groovy tracks kept a very friendly
crowd smiling all night. All the DJs played real-
ly expressive, quality sets of music; none more-
so than M a r k Dale. Mark is the brother of one of
my musical heroes, Colin Dale and is also a very
highly respected DJ. I have seen him play twice
at now. O n c e was on the main floor of The End
at an old Deep Space party where he played
hard and had the crowd screaming for more.
This weekend he played a very different set that
had the same effect! Techno DJs aren't versa-
tile? I don't think so!
All in all, everyone I came into contact with
had a great night out so well done to Analog
City\ If you missed out this time round then you
can catch it every month at the C a m d e n Island
Market. The Electric Cafe will be running future
competitions so you can get in for free!
We're running three competitions for free
CDs! The first one is for a copy of the latest
album on React Records, and the latest chapter
in the Dope on Plastic Series. This features the
best in blunted beats, downbeat funk and hip-
hop. Don't miss out! Here's the question.
Dope on Plastic Five was mixed by DJ |ohn
Stapleton from Bristol. Which famous
Bristolian drum'n'bass artist recently
received a Mercury Music Award for his work
with Reprazent?
The second giveaway is a new C D from 80's
pop icon Gary N u m a n . His by now anthemic
Cars and tracks such as Films and Are 'Friends'
Electric? m a d e him into a household name.
N o w these tracks are back, but in a new shape
and form. Some of the hottest techno artists of
the moment have taken a Gary N u m a n Track
and remixed it. N a m e s include Robert Armani,
Claude Young, Dave Clarke, Alex Hazzard and
Dave Angel. Here's h o w you could win a copy
on C D that has actually been signed by Gary
N u m a n himself!
The track Cars was recently used on a
commercial. What was the product being
advertised? (a) Cars (b) The AA or (c) lager?
Finally, we have copies of a ver exciting new
album from French house DJ Jerome Pacman.
Jerome hails from Paris and is a thoroughbred
DJ in the global house community. He made his
name by playing some really mellow and soulful
house music and injecting plenty of funkier
grooves throughout. This mix is completely rep-
resentative of his style and features the work of
artists such as DJ Sneak, M o o d II Swing, Kevin
Yost and M i k e Huckaby. I really d o rate this mix,
so grab y o u chance to win a copy.
Name the Parisian dance outfit who
stormed the Pop charts with last year's
Homework album and a spate of singles
including Da Funk.

CLUBSCENE - CLUB REVIEW.
IT'S A LONDON THING I
No.4 Club, Bishops Hall, Kingston.
T
his is Scott Garcia's new and
only London residence, every
Friday y o u can catch the man
d r o p p i n g the choicest cuts of
underground/"speed" garage.
Kingston is a little out of t o w n
but w h e n I spoke to Scott he
explained that they wanted to get
out of the centre of t o w n as there is
to much attitude, you get a better
vibe out of town. I have to agree
with him after attending the night a
few weeks back. The lack of a dress
code might also be something to
do with it, you can just chill in ya
jeans and trainers.
No.4 Club was bigger than 1
e x p e c t e d and the decot, y o u
wouldn't call classy. But this just
adds to the underground feel 'n'
vibe this club has. There are plenty
of classy joints in town if you want
what sort of thing. But few with a
true underground feel, it reminded
me of the sort of warehouse raves
of years gone by.
There's an adequate lighting rig,
a b o o m i n g sound system, plenty of
seating and places to get away
from it all and chill, quite a few bars
and they were well staffed, but it
still took ages to get a drink I and
there is even a cafe in their what
more could y o u want.
W e got d o w n there just in time
to catch Scott &. M c Styles doing
their thing and they didn't disap-
point, showing that he is not just a
big name producer that puts his
name to a club, he is a shit hot Dj
in his own right. A n d with guest DJs
such as Norris Da Boss Windross
this week, this is fast becoming a
night not to be missed.
W h e n I was speaking to Scott,
he told me, "what we have done is
make it like a club where 1 would
want to go, and were getting their
it's got the vibe, it just needs the
trimmings" and it's not as if he is
lacking in experience after promot-
ing the SW1 club for a year.
So this is well worth a little trek
out of t o w n to experience the true
flavour of underground /speed
garage. jo Public
