Footballers Win Some Games
But still no excuse to trash a hotel
ICUWAFC v St
GEORGE'S
Nine gluttons for punishment (6 of
which were rather hungover)
arrived at Harlington bright and
early on Sunday morning after the
revelries of the night before
(including the obscene sight of the
Duke of Prague's manhood). W e
would have had a full team but one
random preferred to have a long,
hot bath while the other w a s
unconscious in a pool of her o w n
vomit. This match was crucial to
avoid relegation and also the last
ever match of two former captains
(Scrubber and Hacker), so m u c h
pride was at stake.
Slack, Hungover, shit play saw
us a goal d o w n early o n but, for
the first time ever, Hedge's des-
perate plea of "Let's get one back"
proved effective as Scrubber slot-
ted the ball h o m e after a neat cor-
ner from the "Golden Tamarin".
H o o d y proved to be a useless,
hungover wreck, unable to run or
see efficiently and spent most of
her time bitching about the o p p o -
sition and her inability to score.
The first half e n d e d 2-1 up as Lili
scored a beautiful solo effort,
avoiding the offside trap like a true
professional.
Newly crowned player of the
year "Elhosh" and next year's cap-
tain "Greek Bird" held the defence
and midfield together well and
eventually Scrubber m o n o p o l i s e d a
nice pass through to beat the
keeper 1 on 1. She c o m p l e t e d her
hat-trick a few moments later with
a stunning strike into the right
hand corner.
The r o m p c o n t i n u e d w h e n
another c o o l corner from the
Golden Tamarin w a s met by
Scrubber - goal number four for
her. W e were shitting o n the bitch-
es. The game finished 6-1, w h e n
The Golden Tamarin scored an
opportunistic poacher's goal from
close range.
So we avoided relegation by
the skin of our teeth for the second
year in a row. Well done for an
interesting and sometimes super-
sonic season. For those of us leav-
ing at the end of June, it was an
emotional end to our footballing
careers and I almost felt c o m -
pelled to kiss the hallowed turf of
Harlington (OK not quite.)
ICUWAFC 6 - St George's
ICUAFC I v LSE I
It was third time lucky for the LSE
as they deservedly w o n the U L U
Challenge C u p . Their opponents
Imperial never got into the game,
but deserve credit for being the
first Imperial side to reach the final
in years. Indeed the final will pro-
vide them with vital experience as
they aim to go one better next sea-
son.
LSE dominated from the start
and took the lead w h e n Donal
Keane failed to c o m e out for a
free-kick from the left, leaving the
LSE midfielder with a free header.
A m o and Stewart were out-fought
in midfield, leaving the Imperial
back four unprotected for large
periods of the game. Indeed this
was the case for LSE's second goal
as their Greek striker, w h o later
had a bust-up with Foulstone,
scored his fourth goal in four
g a m e s against
Imperial this season. Worse
was to follow as Keane was lobbed
from 30 yards. Half-time and the
final was virtually over. Surely the
time to make a few changes? N o ,
as Psycho s o m e h o w kept faith
with the starting eleven even
though T i p p a y a w o n g replaced
Shanidze shortly afterwards.
Imperial managed to raise their
game to s o m e extent, but failed to
trouble the LSE goalkeeper w h o
had the M a n of The M a t c h playing
tight in front of
him. Indeed it remains a mys-
tery why Imperial constantly aimed
for Marcos' head when LSE's cen-
tral defender w o n absolutely
everything in the air. LSE then got
their fourth after they broke free
d o w n Imperial's left hand side. N o
way back for IC w h o had substitute
Galliardo carried off with a sus-
pected broken leg late on.
A day of joy for LSE, a day of
misery for Imperial. Key players
simply
didn't perform o n the day, but
spirits were lifted at the annual
Club
Dinner after the game where
Warren Brayn was named Player of
The Year, Foulstone was the DJ,
Shanidze was quiet and Psycho
provided the entertainment".
The presence of Andy Heeps
was m u c h appreciated and allayed
rumours that no-one loves the
footie club.

ICUAFC II v RFH
With a faint hope of the title, IC
seconds needed a win against RFH
who had beaten them earlier in the
season. These wise guys needed a
lesson. It was one of the toughest
matches of the season and also
one of our best performances.
Third team ringer Andy M u r p h y
played superbly at c e n t r e - m i d ,
adding s o m e m u c h needed weight
to the midfield w h o got kicked
about in the last match. The first
half was tight with few chances for
either team, but Ricky H a m the
s e c o n d half of our third t e a m
c o m b o was forced into a spectac-
ular save to keep the scores level
at half time.
In the second half our defence
took control with Rob and Andy
looking superb at the back. The
pressure on RFH grew and grew
until Tony volleyed h o m e in a
crowded area to put us ahead. But
as w e pressed h o m e for the sec-
ond, RFH broke in their first attack
of the whole half and slotted the
ball into the net. With our title
challenge slipping away before our
eyes, w e went mental a n d threw
everything at them. They held on
until the final 100 seconds w h e n ,
with everyone waiting for the whis-
tle, a deep cross from Tony met
Siat w h o volleyed the ball past the
keeper and w o n the match for IC.

Editorial
Hullo my Brethren.
Heavens to Murgatroid! W e have
been busy of late. M a n y of our ath-
letes have been performing sporting
acts that border on the Herculean in
their enormity. So multitudinous
and diverse have your achieve-
ments been that 1 regret that my
woefully inadequate pages have
been unable to cope with your
reports so a number of them had to
be edited to the point of non-exis-
tence. Do not think that I held your
reports in any less esteem (even In
the cases where I did). Suffice to
say that with every word of your
articles that I edit, a little piece of
m e seems to die. I apologise also
for the absence of previously
neglected articles. This is due to the
influence of that despicable ne'er-
do-well Bill Gates and his Insidious
computer programs.
O n another subject altogether,
it saddens me to see that the foot-
ball team's g o o d humoured high
spirits have again caused them to
be thrust centre stage. This is obvi-
ously none of my business so I will
comment upon it no further. Except
to say this. I myself have been on
the receiving end of the wrath
meted out by hotel officials. I will
not dwell on the details of that sor-
did affair, not the night of hell to
which the petty despots of the
Metropolitan police subjected me.
however what 1 did learn from this
lamentable ordeal is this: Hoteliers
have a tendency to blow these
things out of proportion (whether
or not for their o w n perverse satis-
faction I will not speculate) and so
one should not neces-sarily attach
too much credence to the reports
one hears.
If the football team wish to pre-
vent an occurrence of this unfor-
tunate episode, I can but c o m m e n d
to them the advice of my esteemed
collaborator David. This diminutive
Frenchman suggested that the
members of the football club (and
Indeed all Imperial athletes) should
b e c o m e straight-edge punks.
Understandably per-plexed, I
inquired as to the mean-ing of this
phrase. He explained that straight
edge punks, amongst who's num-
ber he counts himself, are punks
who shun alcohol and indeed drugs
of all description. It seems a bizarre
notion and one to which 1 certainly
shall not Incline myself. However
it's certainly something to think
about.
Drop the b o m b - exterminate
them all.
Jacob
