Hail Hockey Heroics Camborne Crushed!
ICUHC II v Kings
Champions. IC seconds destroyed
Kings to claim the second division
championship. N e e d i n g nothing
but a win to secure their G o d Given
place at the league head. The sec-
onds set about this in a most
amusing manner, as Goran took It
and back doored the entire team.
To be honest, the first five minutes
were a pile of crap. Rob deciding
to change this took a silky pass
from Goran and r a m m e d it home.
Then followed what was to be a
turning point in the match. IC was
awarded 2 penalty flicks within 5
minutes. Lightweight and Rab c o n -
verted, (3-0). Kings were not
happy. With a brave defensive cry,
the M a g i c hollered "the onions are
coming" and w e were resolute in
our defence. Half time brought
threats from KCL but to their cha-
grin we were better. W e rolled
d o w n the pitch in w a v e after
relentless wave of pressure, scor-
ing three more without reply. The
Fifth goal was a peach as Shaggy
had time to look up, look d o w n
and fart before scoring.
W e then let Kings have a c o n -
sola-tion goal to prove w e were
also the most generous. To s u m -
marise, the c h a m p a g n e hockey
from the old boys done g o o d . All I
can say n o w is "you wee dancer".
ICUHC II 6 - 1 Kings
Skiing
After a somewhat poor start to the
season the skiers have begun to
show their true potential. In the
Final round of the King's Ski League
Imperial W e produced one of the
most memorable slalom victories
seen at Brentwood In recent years,
by beating the previously unbeaten
Playthings (thanks Oxford 111).
Solid performances by Imperial
I, winning all but one race, irony-
cally against Oxford, ensured 3rd
place overall and guaranteed entry
to the King's Finals to be held over
Easter.
After some close races, mainly
against other Universities' First
teams, Imperial 2 finished a
respectable 14th
A joint Imperial! Charing Cross
Ladies team finished second, only
losing in the final to Playthings
Ladies.
Well done everyone, n o w lets
win the final!
ICUHC III v St
BART'S
What can be said about such a
Titanic goal bonanza? W e were
leading all the way, riding the
game like the thoroughbred stal-
lion it was. II of the goals came
from our new found Casanova,
Yes, II goals by one d e m i -god.
N o w the thirds are going all the
way. D I S C O !
ICUHC III 15 - 0 St Bart's

ICMRFC II v UMDS
Imperial M e d i c s c o m p l e t e d a
clean sweep of all F O U R United
H o s p i t a l s Trophies this
W e d n e s d a y with victories in the
2nd team, 3rd team and ladles
team. Like the first team all the
finals were played against U M D S .
In the 2nd team final a strong
start by Imperial M e d i c s brought a
10-5 advantage at half time, how-
ever U M D S fought back to lead
13-10 but strong defending by the
I M forwards kept t h e m in the
g a m e and excellent kicking by fly-
half Andy Richards together with a
superb try by Simon Church meant
I M w o n the g a m e 21-13.
In the 3rd team final, another
display of excellent kicking by a fly
half, this time M i k e Edbury, meant
St.Mary's were always on top in a
game they w o n 34-3 over Charing
Cross, at third t e a m level the
teams played separately this year.
The Ladles Final was held at
O l d Deer Park on the same day as
the second team final for the first
time this year. In a tightly fought
game, 1M were the victors, the
score 15-10, with the winning try
c o m i n g in the last minute of the
game.

RSM v CAMBORNE
Carnage in Camborne as Royal
Miners show their Bottle
It was that time of year again
when the Royal School of Mines
met Camborne School of Mines in
the worlds second oldest varsity fix-
ture after the boat race.
O n to the football, where w e
had already missed the first goal for
R S M , scored by Craig "Cruyff turn"
Hunn (geology), w h o was celebrat-
ing his 21st birthday. Further pres-
sure resulted in a beautifully taken
goal by R S M captain "sir" Peter
Steele. Looking quite comfortable at
this stage against a g o o d Camborne
side, the referee (wanker) decided
to help his C S M mates out. H e did
this by awarding one of the most
dubious penalties of all time.
However, he hadn't
noticed that we had a decent
keep-er in the form of Nick "forget
about it" Perrier (geology). However,
from the resulting corner the ref
decided to award Camborne a goal.
N o player from either side knew
why. In fact it was clear that the
supposed goal resulted from a ball
not even remotely crossing the line.
R S M were shaken by this and let in
a couple of soft-ish goals. However,
every man gave 100%. C S M eventu-
ally ran out a 4-2 win which they half
deserved to be honest.
Then came the rugby. Played for
a three-foot tin bottle (hence "bottle
match"), which you can see proud-ly
on display in the Union Bar. Right
from the start we had them under
pressure, resulting in James "pretty
boy" Trude (geology) slotting two
penalties before the bastards in the
Camborne crowd nicked the kick-
ing tee. Two tries from eventual
man of the match James "poolips"
Philips (ERE) at scrum half buried
the Camborne scum. The second of
his brace was a gorgeous break
away solo effort from his own half.
Further tries from Rich "slight of
frame" Lloyd (geology) and Dave
H u m e (ERE) wrapped up a con-
vincing victory. Not content merely
to win, the lads also prevented the
Camborne twats from scoring any
points, although this was not a new
experience for them as few of them
have any UCAS points either. Final;
score 26-0.
A jubilant RSM rugby team celebrate their victory.
RSMHC v
CAMBORNE
"We beat Camborne and we beat
Camborne.... " , yes for the first
time in seven years, the men's
R S M hockey team was victorious in
the annual miner's varsity tourna-
ment. Beating Camborne School of
mines 1 -0, they brought home the
illustrious Sharpley Hockey C u p .
Solid d e f e n d i n g from both
sides kept the scores at 0-0 at half-
time, although R S M were unlucky
(a goal being dubiously disal-
lowed.) The deadlock was broken
in the second half, when Henry's
quick strike left the C S M keeper
standing helplessly o n his line.
After that, R S M managed to hold a
firm back line to emerge as victors.
M a n of the match went to Jamie,
w h o epitomised the R S M defence
with his solid tackling.
C S M r e m a i n e d gracious in
defeat afterwards, and it was g o o d
to see s p o r t i n g c o m m e n t s
exchanged at the end of such a
tightly fought contest. Well done
everyone!
