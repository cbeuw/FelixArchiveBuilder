CASH QUESTIONS
Dear Felix
Since becoming Acting Honarary
Junior Treasurer of City and Guilds
College Union recently, several
things have come to my attention,
most of which are related to the
"fund with no name."
It appears that the reason why
the CCUs are failing to provide the
service expected of them, is not just
due to poor union officers, but also
due to a lack of funding from ICU.
In the last few years C&.GU has
lost several thousand pounds of self
generated income and five year plan
money to the "fund with no name."
This is only significant when I
explain what these funds could have
been used for.
Self generated income is the
only money that can be used for
social activities under ICU Finance
rules. This means that several thou-
sand pounds that could have been
used to run bar nights and subsidise
C & C dinners, etc. has been taken by
ICU from C & G U and placed in the
"fund with no name."
Five year plan money is the
money that could have been used
to refurbish the C&.GU office and
buy new computers for use by the
C & G U clubs / societies.
This is just the start of what
appears to be a trend of moving the
money from the C C U s to ICU.
If this trend continues as it
seems sure to do, then the C C U s
will cease to operate altogether.
I hear rumours now that ICU
wants to move the sale of regalia
from C & G U to the ICU shop, reduc-
ing the income of C & G U again. This
is a direct parallel with the way ICU
lost its bookshop last year.
If the funding crisis of the CCUs is
not ended soon, then it looks more
and more likely that the CCUs will
have to unite and fight against ICU.
If the CCUs act together, they
have the majority vote on ICU
Council and can overthrow any more
stupid plans that the anti-CCU mega-
lomaniacs on council may have.
The new exec will have a tough
job to try to rebuild C & G U , but if ICU
will help them, especially financially,
they can start making C & G U work
for the student population again.
Please visit the C & G U office on
level 3 of M e c h Eng occasionally.
Yours campainingly

You complain of ICU 'removing
funds' from the C&.GU. As far as I
am aware, funds are only
returned to ICU at the end of the
year, as with all clubs. The Union
operates a budget system, where-
by you submit an application for
cash before the year starts, stat-
ing how much money you want
and what it is to be spent on.
Subject to approval, this is what
you will receive. If you don't need
all of the money, it is naturally
returned to ICU at the end of the
year. More money may be claimed
from the Union's Finance Council,
who are quite happy to fund justi-
fied applications.
Union money may be spent on
social events, but cannot be used
to buy food or alcohol. This is not
because the Union is mean, but
because it is illegal. Only money
that is earned by the club itself
(self-generated income) used.
However, you should realise that
SGI is still union money and as
such is subject to the usual tot-
ting-up at the end of the year. If
your SGI forms a large part of
your total income, there may be a
case to set up a reserve account
to keep hold of it, but this is gen-
erally only applicable if it actual-
ly exceeds the Union grant.
You concerns over regalia are
also unfounded. While ICU are
planning to sell the ties, scarves
etc from the shop, they are doing
so with the co-operation of the
CCUs, who were unable to sell
them effectively. Furthermore,
they were not making any money
on the sales, do ICU is really
doing them a financial favour.
If C&GU are not able to fund
the projects they require, it is
almost certainly due to bad bud-
geting and financial incompe-
tence, and certainly not some
union conspiracy. 1 hope you will
look into these matters more
carefully before making a fuss at
ICU Council. C&GU have enough
problems at the moment, with-
out one of their exec making a tit
of himself at Council. Ed

THA BOMB!
Dear Felix,
I a m an Indian and like many of
my brown/black friends, I'm into
black music (soul, swing, hip hop
etc). The problem with IC is that
there aren't many nights dedicated
to our kind of music so w e end up
having to go to clubs to enjoy it.
This ends up costing quite a bit,
especially since w e go out so
m u c h ! W e went to the O S C
W e l c o m e night last term and 1 have
to say, it was really shit. So w h e n
we saw the advert for Tha B o m b in
Felix, w e thought it would be pret-
ty crap but decided to go and
check it out anyway. I even called
some friends d o w n from Reading
University.
I have to admit that the night
was bloody brilliant, especially as it
only cost £1 to get in. The music
was great, the drinks were great,
there were even great cocktails
(which we don't even get at the
clubs), the U D H was packed! I was
very impressed, the two fire alarms
did piss me off though.
W h y has it taken y o u so long to
work out that y o u C A N make Friday
nights at the Union enjoyable for
people like me and my friends. I
told my friends from Reading that
this sort of thing happened all the
time, and I think it should. What
would be out of this world would
be if you could use the whole of
the building, including dBs, every
so often. Tell other L o n d o n Unis
about the music, the cocktails etc.
I a m so sure y o u can make this into
something really big, so please can
you try to make this a regular
occurance and give us something
about our Union that w e can boast
about: Tha atom Bomb!

Dear Y.L.
I was really touched by your let-
ter to Felix [1 109, 27 February]. 1
don't really understand any refer-
ences to dogs in the a c c o m m o d a -
tion office. (But then 1 intent to
leave my name on this letter.)
You made me realise it was
about time I got off my b u m and
introduced myself, so here I a m .
M y name is Tasha N e w t o n , and I'm
the ICU a c c o m m o d a t i o n officer. In
short I represent you and another
