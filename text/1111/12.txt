O
n the day of the gig, every-
thing seemed to be hap-
pening so fast. I got a fax
from Wiija Records telling me they
had a couple of spare tickets to see
Cornershop and I was brimming
with anticipation hours before the
band came on stage. I have been
listening to their When I Was Born
For The Seventh Time LP non stop
since Christmas and have been
hooked on the melting pot of p o p ,
Hindi s o n g influences, hip hop,
sonic mashed up grooves and even
a bit of country and western. The
thought of experiencing this
delightful amalgam of sounds was
too g o o d to
be true, and I
h e a d e d
d o w n to
Malet Street
for a chilled
out d u s t e d
down gig of
a lifetime.
The view
I got as 1 had
my hand
i m p r i n t e d
with a bit of
cheesy U L U
h u m o u r
(This Is
H a r d c o r e ? ! )
was of the whole venue seething
with masses of people, an appar-
ently totally up for it c r o w d , but
how w r o n g could 1 have been. U L U
was once an excellent venue for
bands such as C o r n e r s h o p but
restrictions have limited the gener-
al feel and a t m o s p h e r e of the
place. N o w , bands have to leave
the stage before 11 p m !
The strains of Sleep On the Left
Cornershop's frontman Tjinder in a rare
moment of enlightment.
Side powered out complete with
the bass heavy undertones, and
instantly it was clear what attitude
the band was exuding into the ini-
tially eager c r o w d . Firstly, singer
Tjinder Singh was the only member
out of the five w h o was standing.
Secondly, he refused to even
acknowledge that the crowd was
there. What is that all about? W e
aren't mind readers lads! Were we
supposed to believe that they were
actually celebrating inside about
the end of their triumphant recent
tour and that they were really sooo
happy to be there. Well, it worries
me if they were; I'd hate to see
them during a bad patch.
It is hard
to decipher
the animosi-
t y
C o r n e r s h o p
s h o w e d to
their fans,
though 1
wouldn't go
as far as to
call it aloof-
ness. M a n y
people part-
ed with g o o d
m o n e y to
witness the
C o r n e r s h o p
spectacle live
tonight, and it would have been
polite if they had at least recog-
nised this. The band's m o o d of
indifference seeped into the fans,
with even the awesomely catchy
Brimful of Asha only causing a
minor stir of response from the
throngs at the front. This previous
number one should have caused a
riot but the lack of any enthusiasm
and energy on the part of the band
THE HYBIRDS
TheHybirds • • • •
A
hybrid of monkey and man;
this is what 1 thought Richard
W a r r e n , lead singer a n d
songwriter for the Hybirds, was.
This isn't a bad thing. S o m e fine
music has been made by persons
w h o mostly resemble our primate
relations. There's Ian Brown and
err... well, Steven Tyler and err...
Afanis Morissette. That Lee Evans is
a funny bloke as well, isn't he?
Anyway, monkey business aside,
Warren's songs paint a picture that
tells of hard working, earthy and
realistic intentions. There's a w o n -
derfully gritty couplet in the climac-
tic Stranded: 'Picture y o u , picture
me, living life in harmony; I don't
think so. Picture me, picture y o u ;
do you make me feel brand new? I
don't think so.'
This album is perfect for the post-
Oasis c r o w d . It's g o o d solid rock.
M o s t songs start with an easy intro
before building into great big rau-
cous endings. Check out the classic
rock n' roll cries of 'Yeah, yeah,
yeah!' at the end of Stranded and
the gratuitous ' O h yeah"s on the
cheesy rock anthem that is B o m
Yesterday. There also seems to
have been a raid into the intro
meant it got exactly what it
deserved - nothing! Few other
songs from the recent long player
were spewed out with infuriating
nonchalance, and the slightly older
Jullander Shere (surprisingly well
received by the fans) started
promisingly enough but then turned
into a looping frenzy of psychedelia
that drifted on for a staggering 20
minutes, which left most people
feeling faint and close to being
physically ill. It was a poor attempt
at a tranced out blitz that ended
archive when making this album.
The Beatles feature on the opening
instrumental. O a s i s ' s 'Take M e
Away' sounds uncannily similar to
The Only Ones and Shed Seven's
Going for Gold makes a guest
appearance at the beginning of The
Wanderers.
Cliche-free, inspiring and original,
The Hybirds m a y not be. Saviours
of an apparently fading guitar rock
band scene, they could well turn
out to be. The triumphant I'm
Coming Out feels like an emanci-
pation from s o m e form of impris-
onment: be it mental, physical,
social or emotional. The punky 24
makes you turn the stereo up and
practice your best rhythm air guitar
poses and this is what g o o d rock
music does. It hits y o u hard some-
times and it takes you away other
times. It takes y o u away from the
mundane routine. It lifts you above
the rubbish. It seems so simple
that it makes y o u wonder how
some bands lose the plot. The
Hybirds have the rock blueprint to
soar: grab a wing and prepare to
fly. ra

with the drummer and bongo play-
er maniacally killing their equip-
ment with stamina to put any top
class marathon runner to shame.
Bizarrely, after this torturous
finale, the c r o w d called for an
encore. N o prizes for guessing that
they never returned. Cornershop's
present philosophy of 'fans, who
needs ' e m ' needs s o m e radical
changing. H
