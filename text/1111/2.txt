Football Club Fracas
(Take Four)
DAVID ROBERTS
The ICU Football team has landed
itself in controversy once again.
The latest incident took place at
the Kensington Park Hotel during
the team's Annual Dinner, only two
days after a U n i o n disciplinary
found the fourth team guilty of
bringing the Union into disrepute,
after a match at Bath resulted in a
string of complaints from Bath's
Student Union.
Having booked the Hotel with
£ 5 0 0 cash - and thus without the
prior consent of the Union - the
team then p r o c e e d e d to enjoy
themselves in their usual fashion.
Consequently, the Union found
themselves faced with a bill for
damages totalling £ 1 0 3 4 on
M o n d a y morning. The bill includes
"an entire silver cutlery set and a
painting, w h i c h had been torn
down and urinated over". Faced
with the bill A n d y H e e p s , ICU
President, has declared that he will
force the football club to foot the
bill or face disbanding.
However, a football spokesman
suggested that the damage caused
by the party should not be over-
stated; " A few expensive items
were borrowed from the hotel.
They will be returned... Otherwise
it was no different from any other
ICU sports bash". H e went on to
a d d "Kids ex. beer - they just don't
mix".
C o m i n g o n top of other ICU
football related incidents this year,
including the incident at Bath and
the destruction caused by the
H a m m e r s m i t h pub crawl last
November, which led to all IC stu-
dents being barred from several
pubs, this is being seen as the last
straw by senior U n i o n figures.
Severe disciplinary action is
anticipated.
P l e a s e N o t e
There will be N O Felix next
Friday (20 March). Watch out
for a special bumper Easter edi-
tion on Wednesday 25 March.

The d e p a r t m e n t s of M a t e r i a l s ,
Earth Resources Engineering and
the Centre for C o m p o s i t e
Materials scored full marks in a
joint Teaching Quality Assessment
carried out at the beginning of this
month.
The assessment w a s conduct-
ed by the Higher E d u c a t i o n
Funding Council for England and is
part of a national investigation into
the quality of university education.
During the week long assessment a
team of inspectors rigorously
analysed various aspects of the
departments, classified as materi-
als technology, ranging from cur-
riculum design to student support.
M o r e importantly the standard of
teaching, learning and self-assess-
ment was explored in detail to dis-
cover exactly h o w g o o d the educa-
tional package is. It is important to
note that the primary objective of
the assessment was to ascertain
whethet departments are meeting
their attainment targets. However,
this is not to say that those which
aim low get g o o d scores as the
mark also reflects how the high tar-
gets are.
The Dean of the R S M ,
Professor Rees Rawlings, revealed
in a meeting with students that
they had scored 24 points out of a
possible 24. The assessors high-
lighted the excellent links with
industry, the high standard of the
graduates, unparalleled library
facilities and g o o d staff-student
relations. N o other institution has
achieved full marks in this subject
with O x f o r d and Cambridge man-
aging only 23 a n d o l d rivals
Camborne School of M i n e s scrap-
ing 21. Other departments in IC
were also a s s e s s e d , including
C h e m i c a l Engineering and
Aeronautics, but failed to score full
marks. Prof M c L e a n , head of the
Materials department h o p e d that
this mark w o u l d go a long way to
giving the department "recognition
for its high standards".
In the meeting where the tesult
w a s a n n o u n c e d , Professor
Terezopoulos from ERE reminded
the gathering that " N o b o d y is per-
fect", to which the Dean replied, "I
think we're approaching it."
