YOU'RE READING IC RADIO (!!)
IC RADIO 3 March 1998
IC Radio has a sexy new logo!!!!
Another week, another Felix, anoth-
er All N e w IC Radio Page™. This
week I've actually got something
really important to talk about, see-
ing as last week heralded the e n d
of the fabulously spanking logo
competition.
For those w h o are both blind
and deaf, or those w h o have never
before ventured outside the c o n -
fines of their r o o m , 1 will explain.
The logo competition was launched
ages ago now, supported by an
advertising blitz of a scale s o huge
that it has only ever been sur-
passed by the launch of a n e w
M i c h a e l Jackson a l b u m (only
because the council refused t o let
us float a t w o hundred foot replica
of the radio station d o w n t h e
Thames). Since then the entries
have been flooding in, resulting in
the destruction of acres of tropical
rainforest, and the deaths of thou-
sands of small fluffy a n i m a l s .
However, the effort has been worth
it, as n o w IC Radio has a logo it can
be proud of.
W e have h a d loads of entries
which is wicked. Its a big fuck off to
those w h o accuse us IC students of
being apathetic, although the fact
that the prize w a s £ 5 0 of music
might have something to do with it.
Entries from Imperial pissed over
entries from other colleges in the
area, who's contribution totalled a
pathetic zero. Nice one kids.
With the quality of entries being
so high, it w a s extremely hard to
pick a winner. W e eventually nar-
rowed it d o w n to a short list, with
exceptional entries by Richard
Dempers a n d Alastair Warman.
H o w e v e r , the winner w a s
announced live o n air o n Thurday
during John C's lunchtime s h o w to
be Tony Broomfield.
Tony received his award at a
secret venue s o m e w h e r e in
America, and mysteriously in 1994.
In an emotional acceptance speach
he said "I just like to thank every-
one for voting for me. Cheers. Just
as well I thought to wear a Brazil
kit, eh?"
As the standard of entries was
so high, all shortlisted entries will
be displayed in the Radio station
for o n e week only. Entrants are
more than w e l c o m e to collect their
entries from the station after then.
