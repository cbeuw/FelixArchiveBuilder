BUSA Put it to Bed

The dust has finally settled c o n -
cerning Imperial's place in the
British Universities Sports
Association. It appears that IC will
be permitted to take part in c o m -
petitions as a 'hybrid' entry. The
subject has proved to be one of
this year's most contentious
issues, causing numerous debates
within ICU as well as the wider
London student community.
The issue arose because of the
medical schools' merger with their
parent institutes throughout
London. At IC the debate centred
around South Kensington's wish to
join with the medics and enter as a
single applicant, while IC School of
Medicine Students' Union insisted
on having two independent entries.
Last Friday in Birmingham the
B U S A executive c o n v e n e d a n d ,
apparently, laid the issue to rest
with a decision to allow universities
in the London Division to c o m p e t e
in B U S A as 'hybrid' entrants.
Hybrid entry is an ICU idea, and
allows medics to represent either
their parent institute or medical
college o n an exclusive basis.
Other students of the university will
only be allowed to represent their
own institute. The system has suc-
ceeded in placating several other
L o n d o n universities and their
respective medical schools, and
should ease the transition from
affiliate to merged subsidiary. It
has been agreed that the system
will be used until 2001, when all
the universities involved will use
single entries. There is a possibility
that the B U S A executive will refuse
to give the final approval at their
next meeting on 15 June, but the
chances of this are being dismissed
as "negligible" by ICU.
Charlie Joynt, Deputy President
(Clubs cv Societies), is relieved that
the issue is at an end; "It got off to
a shaky start - IC council didn't
take the right attitude to start off
with, however we went back to the
drawing board, came up with a
better plan and convinced London
of the plan's worthiness".

facilities remain and expand..."
In his letter, M r Heeps also
pointed out that under the
M e m o r a n d u m of Understanding -
the agreement by which College
determines the basis of the Union's
existence - the areas designated for
the Union include "the space cur-
rently o c c u p i e d by the Travel
Agencies... and Sherfield R o o m
216C [the site of the present STA
Academic Travel shop] in accor-
dance with the terms of the lease
agreement approved by College on
9 November 1993". Although this
document is currently being rewrit-
ten, the present version is still valid.
However, most senior figures ques-
tioned believe that the Rector could
have it overturned almost at will. M r
Heeps also notes that the Union
paid £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 four years ago to have
the room developed so that it could
be used by STA "converting it from a
catering storeroom into the retail
outlet that currently occupies the
space".
O n the financial side the out-
come comes as another blow, c o m -
pounding the loss of income from
the Bookstore, for which an appro-
priate level of compensation has still
not been agreed, a year after the
closute. C o m i n g in the same week
that the Union Executive agreed to
spend £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 on the essential
redevelopment of the ground floor
of the Union Building during the
summer, this puts ICU in a precari-
ous position. It has also been a
major factor in the recent resigna-
tion of Brian Roscoe, the 1CU Shop
Manager
It is the long-term strategy
behind the move which has caused
the greatest concern. Fears that the
College's goal is to remove the
Union's right to trade, and replace
the income generated with
increased central funding may
sound harmless, but M r Heeps
sums-up the feelings of many in the
Union in his letter, saying "such a
move would breed a dependency
culture, which would lead to the
downfall of the Union's identity and
pride... It is therefore essential that
the Union receives a guarantee that
the Union Shop, Newsagents and
refectories continue to exist as ser-
vices run by students for students...
so that threats which currently
emanate from the College can be
quashed". In the end, however, the
chain of events means that the JCR
development should now go ahead
in time for the arrival of the medical
students in the Autumn, and the
cost must now be borne in its
entirety by College.
