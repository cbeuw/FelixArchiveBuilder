AND DO SOMETHING

No 1111: No Bridges Please
Hello a n d w e l c o m e back t o m y
evil brain teasers. For this week's
challlenge, you will need pen and
paper. The margin of those quan-
tum mechanics notes will do fine.
It is well known that gas,
electricity a n d water companies
cannot cooperate t o save their
lives, and will always dig u p the
road just after the BT people
have finished. Imagine, though
that just for o n c e they work
together.
Three n e w houses have just
been built. T o represent these,
draw three dots in a row. W e also
have three utilities - gas, water
and electricity. Draw these as a
second row of three dots o p p o -
site the first. The problem is:
How may each of the hous-
es be connected to each of the
three utilities without any of
the pipes/cables intersecting
one another?
The answer t o puzzle 1110 (Cleaning Windows) is 5 . 5 3 m .
Correct answers received from Nicola Hargreaves and Damien
Fell. G o o d work! If you're wondering what the trick was - there
was n o trick. You have t o solve the nasty quartic equation
numerically (or draw a scale drawing).
Mail or e-mail your answers to the Felix office (felix@ic.ac.uk). If you
are correct, your name will be printed in a blaze of glory next week.
Contributions of similar logic / maths puzzles gratefully received.

QuizIC - The First Annual British National
Academic Quiz Tournament
On 28 March at Imperial College, the first British National Academic Quiz
Tournament will take place. It is set to include teams from Imperial, Oxford,
Cambridge, Manchester, Durham and other Universities.
This is a call for help! W
e need organisers, competitors and an audi-
ence for what we hope will be the start of a great tradition.
If you feel that you are a budding trivia whizz-kid and you want to
represent Imperial College at this prestigious event, get in touch with us...
there is an opening for more than one Imperial College team, so anyone who
wants to take part should let us know. Excellent practice for University
Challenge.
W
e also need help with moderating, timekeeping and general organisa-
tion of what is likely to be a hectic event. If you feel that you have something to
offer us then please let us know. There should be a decent knees-up at the end
and just think of how it would look on your CV!
Alternatively, come and support your University and simply enjoy
nine or ten rounds of challenging trivia. The event centre will be at the main
entrance to the Blackett Building, Prince Consort Road and the day will run
from 9.30am to 5.30pm with a break for the boat race!
For more details, e-mail quiz@ic.ac.uk or check out our Web Page at
www.su.ic.ac.uk/quiz, but hurry... there are only 14 quizzing days left!
