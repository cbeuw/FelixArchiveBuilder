The Society is Changing
as of this Sunday and at every Sunday Show thereafter,
members of ICU Cinema will be able to borrow books and
videos free of charge, all that is needed is your membership
card and a refundable £20 deposit. We are aiming to offer
books and videos that are not readily available and great
titles that perhaps you haven't heard of.
For further details write to cinema@ic.ac.uk
Sundays are free
