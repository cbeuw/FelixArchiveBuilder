One of more useful things about
having new governments is that they
take a fresh look at affairs, a n d find
it politically a great deal easier to
change them. With this in mind, one
of the first acts of the present
Government was to form a cross-
party M o d e r n i s a t i o n C o m m i t t e e ,
which looked at ways of making the
C o m m o n s more user-friendly. This
has just submitted its report to the
House. This report covers aspects of
the debating process itself - more
fundamental changes to the ways
M P s work and live are months, if not
years away.
Some of the things that are like-
ly to be scrapped seem to have long
lived past their usefulness. Under
present Parliamentary procedure, if
a M e m b e r shouts "1 spy strangers",
the Speaker must call a vote o n
whether to ban "strangers" from the
room. Strangers are people within
the Parliamentary building w h o are
not Members or Peers. The name
Strangers itself is up for review - it is
considered not particularly w e l c o m -
ing. The procedure was originally
adopted to prevent agents of the
monarch listening in to debates and
reporting the results back to the
palace. It was also used during the
Second World War for security rea-
sons, although it could never realis-
tically be used now, since it would
not look too impressive for a consti-
tutional democracy not to let the
public hear what its supreme body
was discussing. Instead it is used
now to interrupt debates, something
which it can d o to g o o d effect.
Another ridiculous regulation up
for the scrapheap is the rule that a
M e m b e r must be "seated and cov-
ered" to make a point of order dur-
ing a debate. Opera hats are placed
at strategic points around the cham-
ber, and whilst one is being passed
themselves suspended, although
they may soon be unpaid. There are
certain limits to what can be done
within disciplinary policy - a person
returned by a constituency should
not just be told he can't turn up or
vote anymore, since that goes
directly against the principle of
democracy, but there are certain
things that can and it seems, will be
done to redress the balance. O n the

to the M e m b e r making the point,
they tend to cover their head with a
piece of paper. The vision of an M P
making a serious point on parlia-
mentary procedure whilst wearing a
silly hat has, in the view of the
Modernisation Committee, "almost
certainly brought the House into
greater ridicule than almost any
other. W e d o not believe that it can
be allowed to continue."
The House is also cracking d o w n
on bad behaviour from its members
- showing a new sensitivity to public
opinion o n its rowdiness and ill-dis-
cipline. Presently, M e m b e r s can
obtain some free publicity by getting
issue of general behaviour within the
chamber, various ideas that were
proposed (mainly by the new intake)
were discarded: Members will still
address the Speaker, rather than
each other; M e m b e r s will call each
other "the H o n M e m b e r for [con-
stituency]" rather than by name (this
was to make it more difficult to refer
to each other quickly, to stop
debates degenerating into slanging
matches); Members will still vote in
person; and finally, the Speaker can
still hold Members to account for
their behaviour. O n e change will
occur though: members of the Privy
Council (those w h o are called "Rt
Hon"- m e m b e r s a n d ex-
members of the Cabinet and
party leaders) will no longer
receive preference in the
speaking order, to allow all
M e m b e r s to receive equal treatment
within the chamber.
O n e of more interesting, and
perhaps most important recom-
mendation from the committee was
that certain bills could g o through
Parliament more slowly, taking t w o
years rather than just o n e . The
administrative nightmare of allowing
the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill to
take longer than a single parliamen-
tary term (period of time between
Queen's Speeches) was generally
considered to be senseless waste of
time. This would prevent debacles
such the law creating the Child
Support Agency, which was rushed
through without proper scrutiny,
bequeathing us the present mess.
The minutiae of parliamentary
procedure m a y seem dull to those
not involved (if you think this lot was
bad, the don't read Erskine M a y , the
6 0 0 + page guide to procedure: vet-
eran M P s say they still don't under-
stand it all) but it is vitally important
in the passage of sensible legislation
and maintaining Parliament high in
the public e s t e e m . If the
Government can d o this well, they
will certainly have left at least one
g o o d legacy to its successors.
