O n c e upon a time, there was old,
old d o c u m e n t called, although
n o b o d y k n o w s why, the
Memorandum of Understanding.
Archaeologists, after years of
studying the bizarre and bewilder-
ingly complex language, have c o m e
to the conclusion that is w a s an
agreement between what is now
called the Great Impetial W o r l d
Legacy and s o m e t h i n g called
"Imperial College Union". Says the
document: "The College will c o n -
tinue to involve its students", what-
ever they are, "through the
Imperial College Union, in discus-
sion on all policy and administra-
tive matters concerning students'
social, cultural, welfare, sporting,
academic and other appropriate
interests."(it was written in the
days w h e n sport and cultural activ-
ities were still permitted by the
Legacy). Stranger still, it appears to
actually offer concessions to ICU:
"Any changes to this document...
shall be as a result of full consulta-
tion with ICU and as finally deter-
m i n e d by the G o v e r n i n g Body
[Power a n d Fortune to the
Legacy]." W h a t can it possibly
mean? Let us look inside...
Here we find the greatest sur-
prise of all - the Legacy allowed

from trading activity on its o w n
property - "1CU may continue to
operate legitimate trading activities
in the College", and "ICU may

then, that the d o c u m e n t dates
from the s a m e period that histori-
ans believe formed the beginning
of the Legacy's great empire build-
ing era - subsuming a little book-
shop, travel agent and bar before
moving on to annex other campus-
es, universities a n d entire coun-
tries, but we all know that. Indeed,
the document was in force during
this entire period (though it was
w a t e r e d - d o w n in 1998) but must
have been totally disregarded; take
for instance " I C U may occupy... in
order to fulfil its legitimate role and
may allow outside organisations to
use whole or parts of it for any
agreed purpose... N o 4. Sherfield

dance with the terms of the lease
agreement approved by M P G on 9
November 1993", in place when,
according to a rare surviving copy
of the evil anti-legacy newspaper
Felix, the J YA shop was taken by
the college without consultation or
Governing Body approval (Power
and Fortune to the Legacy).
But then again, the Legacy
would never have got where it is
today giving concessions to weak,
subversive influences such as this
Imperial College Union seems to
have been!
