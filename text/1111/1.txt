Imperial College's consistent
research excellence has been
emphatically rewarded with the
princely s u m of £ 1 0 4 million in
research funding. This is the largest
amount allocated to any university
in the country, according to the
Times Higher Education
Supplement. The figure is made up
of m o n e y f r o m the Higher
Education Funding Council for
England, as well as the college's
generic income from joint projects
with industry. The amount is a 5.1 %
increase o n last year and places
Imperial above Cambridge a n d
Oxford, w h o were rewarded £ 9 0
and £ 8 4 million respectively.
The 1998-99 allocations are the
result of a research assessment
exercise carried out in 1996. This
assessment was also used to assign
last year's funding levels, but
Imperial received less as some of its
grant w a s used to support those
w h o performed badly in the assess-
ment. This time Imperial has
retained its full award, leaving the
HEFCE to pay the aid bill. The
assessment procedure, which is still
under development; considers a
wide range of factors a n d allots
them a relative weight.
All universities have received an
increase o n last year's awards in
cash terms, but the high flyers have

clearly prospered to the detriment
of the lesser universities, with 24 of
the 135 higher education institutes
gaining monetary increases below
inflation.
Imperial has avoided getting
caught up in the rapture caused by
the results' a n n o u n c e m e n t last
week, viewing the THES figures as
extremely dubious. According to
the finance department £ 1 70 mil-
lion is a more accurate estimation
of IC's research funding, but the
increase o n last year is apparently
only slightly above inflation, with
one department source stating "we
don't think we're that much better
off than last year". The amount
includes revenue from tuition fees,
which "causes us s o m e concern".
It is felt that the college is in a
slightly more vulnerable position
than last year, as the funding is the
source of academic staffs' salaries,
and difficulties with the collection
of student fees could strain college
resources.
O n a national scale academic
staff are exposed in having to rely
so heavily o n student fees. David
Triesman, General Secretary of the
Association of University Teachers,
w a s far f r o m contented with
Government spending; "The univer-
sities are hanging on- by their finger
nails. W e recognise a serious effort
is being made to inject stability, but
it remains a constant problem while
all the big policy decisions for high-
er education are o n ice."
College Steal STA Deal
DAVID ROBERTS
The Union has found itself £ 4 2 , 0 0 0
per year worse off this week as a
result of a move from College
which has been described by
one senior source as "black-
mail". College has demanded a
70% share of the proceeds gen-
erated from the space rented to
STA Travel, which at present
goes directly into Union fund-
ing. If the Union d o not accept I
this deal then the Rector, Sir I
Ronald Oxburgh, has stated that I
the planned jCR development 111
will not g o ahead. f
The edict from Sir Ron comes
shortly after College attempted
to force the Union to pay £ 100,000
for the desperately needed renova-
tion, and thus some see the move
on top of last year's loss of the
Union Bookstore a n d recent
attempts by its successor,
Waterstone's, to take over the sta-

tionary and card trade o n campus,
senior figures view this as the next
step in the Rector's master-plan to
as being purely cash-driven. Coming remove ICU's entire trading arm
which at present generates in
excess of £ 100,000 worth of extra
funding for Union clubs a n d
services.
With 2 7 0 new students
arriving o n c a m p u s in
October, ICU have been left
with no options but to accept
the deal, leading Andy Heeps,
ICU President, to describe
this as "the worst week of my
Presidency." In a letter to the
Rector dated 10 March, M r
Heeps laid out the terms on
which the Union accepts the
deal; "That the Union is rede-
v e l o p e d over the summer
vacation... that the Union is
not financially disadvan-
taged... that the College affirms its
