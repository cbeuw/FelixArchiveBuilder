YOU CAN LEAD A WHORE TO CULTURE, BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE HER THINK
ALAN DAVIES -
The Duchess Theatre
A
lthough Alan Davies' West
End Tour for 1998, "Urban
Trauma" sold out on the first
night, his PR people guaranteed
that he would be back in the future.
The man has travelled a r o u n d ,
which y o u can tell from the theme
that pervades his c o m e d y routine.
The small, yet packed, theatre held
an audience that s e e m e d to expect
this; many of them appeared to
anticipate his jokes and shouted
out one liners in the middle of the
performance in an attempt to inter-
act with him. After a while, s o m e of
the audience became irritating, but,
with some effort, could be ignored.
Davies himself w a s confident
behind the microphone, although
LIVE
he constantly p a u s e d to take
mental breathers by repeating
earlier-introduced s o u n d effects
and performing silly dance routines
across the stage.
The c r o w d came prepared to
laugh, and did so after every joke
(or attempted joke), even when the
comedian's remarks weren't partic-
ularly funny. A s s e e m s to be
c o m m o n with m a n y s t a n d - u p
comedians, Davies focused on a
particular topic and then continuely
lapsed off into tangent after
tangent, only to return to his origi-
nal topics suddenly, sometimes
m u c h later in the performance.
This forced me to stay focused on
Davies' words at the risk of b e c o m -
ing completely lost. M o s t of his
routine consisted of pointing out
the little-noticed ironies that occur
in every aspect of normal, everyday
life. From the Olympics to m a d
c o w disease to the potential evil
plots of household cats and to the
genetic engineering of a mouse
with a human ear, Davies attempts
to make us step back for a m o m e n t
to ask, " W h y are w e doing this?"
He points out the ironies that w e
think about every day, but never
actually take the time to concen-
trate on or wonder about what
c o u l d be g o i n g on behind the
scenes. Davies' world is one of
conspirators and skeptics, and he
does a g o o d job of pointing out
that w e are all one of the two.
So if y o u are a fan of comedy,
and are in the m o o d for a relaxing
night out, find out where Alan
Davies is performing. Try to be in a
somewhat focused m o o d , as his
string of jokes are often hard to
follow, especially since he usually
just jumps into new topics without
introducing them. Watching Davies
is definitely two hours well spent,
but if y o u ask whether or not he's
worth the hefty price tag of a West
End p e r f o r m a n c e , my answer,
"perhaps not." It would probably
be just as g o o d to watch him on
television or video.

SILLY COW
The Grace Theatre
T
rying to put the w o r d s eight-
ies, relevant and g o o d in the
same review is difficult, but
trying to make t h e m work on a
stage takes something a little bit
more special. This production at
the Grace manages to handle this
problem extremely well by compli-
menting delightful performances
with a marvellous script to produce
a highly entertaining and enjoyable
show. It's strange that the high-
lighted subject of the play, the
moral void of journalistic integrity,
can still find a c o m m o n place
within our society and news - it
helps us to appreciate s o m e of the
humour and references w h e n they
talk of situations w e knew of only
as children.
The atmosphere looks, feels
and smells of the eighties, as w e
witness the day of super bitch critic
Doris as she is being taken to court
for her previous remarks about an
actress - something she is quite
prone to doing. Milling around her
are the, maybe slightly overdone,
characters of her moralistic PA,
slimy and loathsome 'soon to be'
boss, nerdish accountant, and her
"trippin' an' ravin' all nigh'" toy boy
(a truly wonderful portrayal of men
in their most annoying state). They
muddle around her, complimenting
and flattering her before she heads
off to court, and by the end of the
first act we've been led pleasantly
to the conclusion of the case, with
m o m e n t s of a m u s e m e n t and
absurdity.
I have to admit that during the
interval I w o n d e r e d where the plot
might be going, as it certainly didn't
look too promising, and the charac-
ters all seemed to be a little to
much at that point. However, any
doubts 1 may have had were
dispelled early in the second half as
the script, actors and play took on
a w h o l e n e w path. It t w i s t e d ,
turned, delighted and enthralled at
such a pace there were times when
it was hard to get a breath in
between laughing. Wonderful Ben
Elton, and full justice done to it
Although this is the smallest of
the venues they have been to
(having p e r f o r m e d already in
Bristol, Edinburgh and Dublin) the
limited space presented no prob-
lems to the actors as they filled the
theatre with their lively and charis-
matic personalities and bought
home the excesses of life in the
era. It has to be said that Charlotte
Franklin w h o not only played Doris,
but also helped to produce the play
obviously managed to juggle the
two roles extremely well.
In a venue that should appeal
to students in so many ways (it's
above a g o o d pub, it's on bus
routes f r o m college, there's
concession tickets available as well
as tickets which include dinner) and
with such a well known playwright,
it should make going to see this
performance even more enjoyable.
If you don't like Ben Elton you
might find y o u enjoy this, if you d o
like Ben Elton I think you'll love it.

PHOTOSOC EXHIBITION PREVIEW
The Ante Room Gallery
F
rom the portrayal of a capti-
vated audience of the humor-
ous street performers in
Covent G a r d e n to the abstract
colour saturated shot of the
Guggenheim M u s e u m in Spain, this
exhibition reflects s o m e t h i n g of
each individual photographer.
These, and around 50 other
photographs will be on display at
the 1998 P h o t o s o c Exhibition,
which begins on the 16th of M a r c h .
The exhibition does not have a
theme to it, and pictures range
from the humorous to the abstract,
touching to sombre, m o r b i d to
obscure.
As in every year, the standard is
very high. As an amateur society,
everything w e ' v e learnt a n d
produced is either self-taught or
through the lessons given by the
society to its members. That our
members have devoted so m u c h
time to taking and printing the high
quality images in the exhibition
shows the passion and enthusiasm
that they possess for the hobby.
For those n e w members to the
hobby, this is the opportunity to
display the talent they have so far
d i s c o v e r e d ; while for older
members, it's another chance to
proudly display their work. The
exhibtion runs until the 25th of
M a r c h in the Ante R o o m of the
Sherfield Building, and is definitely
worth a visit.
