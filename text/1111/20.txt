SALAD DAYS
Union Concert Hall
O
kay, so it's the morning
after, and I'm sitting here
desperately trying to write
up my CV, w h e n suddenly..."We're
looking, we're looking, we're look-
l o o k - l o o k - l o o k - l o o k i n g . . . . " O h ,
where was I? O h , yes, I'm
attempting to s u m up the achieve-
ments of my illustrious career in a
couple of pages of absolutely truth-
ful and in no way exaggerated
prose, w h e n I'm distracted
by "We're looking for a P - l - A - N -
O ! " If by now you're wondering
what the hell I'm talking about, I'm
being plagued by the infectious
melodies and sparkly silliness of
"Salad Days," the show which has
just finished a five night run aided
by the silver tongues and twinkle
toes of Imperial College Operatic
Society.
The plot, as vaguely intimated
in our preview two weeks ago,
concerns in s o m e way that most
innocent of musical instruments, a
piano. In fact, not just any old
piano - but "the one that maks you
dance!" The plot itself is, of
course, highly spurious, being a
chain of events of quite unrivalled
implausibility, strung shamelessly
together and connected by links
lacking in even the faintest trace of
credibility. This was, even more
obviously, the intention of the
authors; the plot is simply a vehicle
for the songs, and an excuse for
some silly dancing - and let's face
it, w h o needs an excuse for that?
During the course of the show we
encounter a magical piano called
Minnie, w h o is in the competent
hands of our heroes Timothy and
|ane, a deliciously tacky nightclub,
and the obligatory flying saucer
complete with attendant aliens.
The whole show is peppered
with humour, ranging form the
surreal to the downright ludicrous,
with a few horrendous puns along
the way. The cast really use this to
full effect, and we are treated to
s o m e truly priceless m o m e n t s .
O n e such occurs during an almost
serious dialogue, when a nun roller-
skates serenely across the stage,
Martini-girl style, balancing a gin
bottle above her head. Toward the
e n d of the s h o w , the magical
Minnie is lost, and everyone and
everything is thrown into chaos.
The entire population of London
appears to be out in force search-
ing for her, and this is where the
i m m o r t a l " l o o k - l o o k - l o o k - l o o k -
looking" occurs. Just when despair
is nigh, darkness falls over the
world, and we witness the landing
of the mandatory U F O , which looks
suspiciously like a Tardis. Here
c o m e s what is possibly my
favourite m o m e n t in the w h o l e
thing; T r o p p o , one of the
guardians of the piano, a wonder-
fully cute and timid character w h o
communicates only through mime,
is so terrified that he unfolds from
his pocket a brown paper bag, and
places it over his head, this remov-
ing the cause of his fear. N o w we
meet the occupants of the flying
saucer, a crew of lycra-clad aliens
with big hair and even bigger feet,
who danced in a most alluring
manner, their lycra tastefully cut to
reveal one nipple. O f course, for
the spacecraft our heroes are able
to spot Minnie, and return to earth
to rescue her, saving the day. After
that, naturally, everyone gets
married, and they all live happily
ever after.
N o w we c o m e to the bit you've
all been waiting for - my verdict.
Firstly, I was impressed by the
chorus line, with excellent singing
and diction, and some very stylish
dancing - especially on the part of
the stripping nuns. There was also
very g o o d singing from all the prin-
cipals, s o m e of w h o s e songs
weren't the easiest in the world to
sing. There was a large amount of
s h a m e l e s s h a m m i n g , (but what
else can you d o with a script like
that?) although there was some
very nice acting, particularly as the
sober Minister for Pleasure and
Pastimes, and the fragile c a m p
tailor, w h o I only later discovered
were played by the same person.
The universal set was simple and
fitted each scene well, and the
costumes were absolutely stun-
ning, especially those wonderful
aliens. I left the hall in the m o o d
to sing and dance, and had to
consciously stop myself from
tapping my feet. I could add a
couple more criticisms, but 1 don't
think 1 will, because all in all I
enjoyed the s h o w so m u c h !

COSI FAN TUTTE
Shaftesbury Theatre
W
ith its i m p r o b a b l e
disguises a n d farcical
d e c e p t i o n s , Cosi fan
tutte has often been visualised as a
frivolous entertainment, with a plot
that scarcely deserves the a c c o m -
plished genius of his score." -
Jonathan Miller, Director
This is a shame, because the
frivolity of the opera's plot high-
lights the theatrical conventions of
the time. Four lovers deceive them-
selves and each other by a mixture
of disguises and g o o d luck. In the
same way that Lois Lane can't
recognise Clark Kent as Superman
when he's wearing glasses, the two
sisters cannot recognise their
lovers w h e n they're disguised as
Albanians. It sounds silly, and to a
certain extent it is very silly, but the
opera shouldn't be dismissed as
trivial. The "artificial c o m e d y "
demonstrates reality, without
blindly representing it. It's the
symmetry of the plot, the four
deceitful/self-deceiving lovers, and
the t w o guardians of moral author-
ity, Reason and Instinct, that
makes the opera so completely of
its time. The librettist, da Plante,
worked very closely with M o z a r t on
the opera, to produce a beautiful
piece of theatre.
I know that many people feel
that opera is irrelevant to their
lives, they don't like it, they can't
understand it, it's in a foreign
language, but d o n ' t dismiss it.
O p e r a is universal, it isn't only put
on for the benefit of rich people
and companies. It's a tragedy that
many people don't enjoy classical
music; it's not boring or preten-
tious, and I'm not wierd for being a
fan. O f course y o u have musical
snobs, w h o elegantly sneer at you
when y o u prefer Puccini to some
obscure Yugoslavian c o m p o s e r
with an unpronounceable name
and impossible to listen to music.
But then there are indie snobs w h o
prefer s o m e u n k n o w n band to
anything popular, despite the
difference in quality. In my ideal
world, this sort of musical snobbery
wouldn't exist, and opera would be
as popular R'n'B and indie.
I a m leaving the main point of
this article far behind, however. Do
go and see the production, it's
bound to be amazing. The director
is wonderful, and the opera w o n
much praise from critics w h o know
about opera the first time around.
It'll be worth it. Really.
