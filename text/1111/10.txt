The Many Faces of

S
trange events were taking place around
Hammersmith. Innocent medical students
on their way to a lecture were over-
whelmed by the presence of a film crew outside
the Reynolds building and even more a m a z e d to
spot Robson Green, star of TV's Soldier, Soilder
and one half of the successful singing d u o
Robson &. Gerome, calmly eating a sandwich!
Well I a m never one to pass up an opportunity,
and the lovely bloke agreed to be harassed by
me, all in the name of journalism. So, after 15
hours of filming (thats h i m not me), I asked
him...
CLARE: So what were y o u filming for today,
Robson?
R O B S O N : It is for the s e c o n d series of a TV
drama called Touching Evil which is about the
motives and psychology behind serial killers. I
am a detective in the serial crime unit, it's not
about what they d o but why.
C: similar to Cracker then?
R: Yes, very similar, it is written by Paul Abbott
who wrote many of the Cracker episodes. H e is
a very talented guy w h o writes very truthfully, he
is very g o o d at adapting life's experiences and
relating them to his work.
C: Wasn't he involved with Reckless too?
(Shown o n television last month, Robson starred
alongside Francesca Annis as an english surgeon
who falls for his boss' wife.)
R: Yes, it has also been nominated for an RTS
?r half of Robson & Gerome and
lusive interview...
drama award. Paul saw me in The Gambling
Man and liked my work so asked if 1 would be
interested in doing Reckless so w e got together
for that and now w e are working on a second
series of Touching Evil. The first episodes should
be shown about April.
C: So what about the music career then?
R: (laughs) M u s i c career? Well.. 1 was actually a
professional singer for four years before I
became an actor. The singles recorded with
Gerome took off really quickly, it was weird. W e
sang the first single Unchained Melody in the
series and were approached by record c o m p a -
nies wanting to release it, suddenly millions of
people were buying our records! It was fun but 1
am glad 1 got out when 1 d i d .
C: N o plans for another single then?
R: N o ! There is something rather corrupt about
the music industry, very fickle and competitive,
there is no sense of community... A n d you can
quote me on that. (1 have!)
C: What did you think of the Brit Awards and the
water-throwing episode?
R: 1 thought they were self-obsessed and self-
conceited arseholes! It was a pointless act
which effectively insulted the people that are
paying thier wages. 1 wouldn't have done it, the
whole awards business is just for the music
industry.
C: You met a lot of medical students today,
does it worry y o u that the future of the Health
Service is in our hands?
R: (laughs) N o . 1 have no worries about those
that have been through all their training. I a m
not concerned about the standards but 1 d o
worry about those that are running the health
service from their offices, behind the scenes.
The doctors and nurses are overworked and
underpaid.
C: M m m . . . might meet you at the other end of
my scalpel one day! What is it like being a
celebrity then?
R: (Groans) I don't feel like a celebrity and I
hope 1 don't c o m e across like one! I don't like
playing the celebrity, I don't d o PR evnts and
hate doing live TV interviews. I will only d o
events to promote the project that I a m working
on. 1 think the musical part took off at the same
time as my acting career and I was worried that
the music may detract from the serious work
but luckily it has become more settled now so
the celebrity issue is not so important. Some
people live off their status but I don't want to be
famous for the sake of it.
C: I was asked to find out which football team
you support.
R: (grins) Which one d o y o u think?
C: U m . . . Newcastle?
R: Yes! (Silly question really!)
C: (Desperately trying to think of a new, inter-
esting and original question to ask) So how do
Y O U eat your creme eggs then? (Oh my god. I
can't believe I just did that.)
R: (looks suprised then laughs) I don't eat them,
eggs are bad for y o u !
C: Did you know that according to a survey by a
leading w o m e n ' s magazine, y o u have been
rated sixth in the "Optrex D e w Drops Valentines
Eyes Survey", beaten by Brad Pitt I a m afraid!
R: The what?? I have no idea what that is all
about but I a m very flattered anyway! It is a
compliment to my m u m w h o has beautiful eyes
and my brother too. H e has great eyes. Its def-
initely genetic! N o w blue eyes is dominant isn't
it?
C: (thinks: Brother? H m m m . Blue eyes? H m m m )
I haven't really been to enough genetics lec-
tures, sorry!
R: A h !
C: Well thats about it. unless y o u wish to add
any scandelous details to give me a nice head-
line...
THE VERDICT: D o w n to earth and very friendly
(and the eyes are nice!) If y o u missed the last
series of Touching Evil then look out for the new
one in April. If y o u are a medic then look out for
the Charing Cross scenes in episode three.
Cheers Robson!
