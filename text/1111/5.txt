Naturally, I feel awful that you
felt there was nowhere for you to go
when y o u had hassle with
Clayponds. Has 1 been in the office,
you could have come to me, and if
you're worried about next time, get
in touch. Anyone w h o needs to, can
phone or email me, or drop in a note
to my ICU resources pigeon hole.

Dear Felix
There can be no one w h o loves
their country more, however 1 will
be backing M o n a c o against
M a n c h e s t e r U n i t e d in next
Wednesday's second leg of the
Champions league quarter finals
and would advise anyone reading
to do the same. You don't have to
have held a season ticket, travelled
hundreds of miles to see Doncaster
play a meaningless home game, or
turned out o n a freezing, w e t
January evening to see Luton in the
Autowindscreen Shield to under-
stand what lies at the heart of an
apparently unpatriotic d e c i s i o n .
No, one only has to care about
football and be concerned at the
strengthening hand of commercial-
ism and m e r c h a n d i s i n g in the
game. These are aspects of the
modern game which are increasing
controlled by a vain, soulless band
of people w h o buy the gear n o w
that football is fashionable but d o
not actually ever turn up to a
m a t c h . Y o u only have to visit
almost any t o w n or city in Britain to
be appalled that M a n c h e s t e r
United replica kits outnumber any
other team. This is the m o d e r n
social problem of the popularisa-
tion of football which has manifest-
ed itself largely u p o n Manchester
United, presently by far the most
successful team around. This must
not be taken wrongly by genuine
Reds fans w h o will realise along
with fans of the game that the cur-
rent manager and team are the
best package the English g a m e has
seen for years and the vast majori-
ty of those w h o pack O l d Trafford
are as genuine as those w h o rattle
around in Belle Vue or Spotland.
There is nothing w r o n g with not lik-
ing football, each to their o w n , but
what is irritating is the M a n U t d cul-
ture of pseudo-fans w h o are only
interested because football is in
fashion and have tried to share in
the club's success by just buying a
shirt or using a M a n U t d product. In
the process almost all other league
clubs are damaged, especially sec-
ond and third division ones, as the
gulf in money and interest between
the top and bottom in football is
pulled further and further apart to
the point where clubs fold. This will
be illustrated next W e d n e s d a y
when any bar or big screen will be
twice as full for the return leg than it
would be if any other English or
Scottish team represented the UK in
Europe. I'm afraid that this now
represents the unacceptable face of
football and the sycophants
attached to M a n U t d are the worst
and most persistent offenders. It
must be best for all w h o genuinely
care about the British national game
to see M o n a c o leave the Theatre of
Dreams victorious and put a brake
on this runaway delirium.

GLIDING PLEA
Dear Felix,
I a m writing, o n behalf of
Imperial College Gliding Club, to
thank everyone w h o came to visit
us on Thursday 5th when w e had a
glider parked on the Queen's Lawn.
For those people w h o didn't know
about this, our reason for doing so
(apart from it being the club's 68th
anniversary) was to advertise our
offer of an introductory flight for
half-price (i.e. £9 instead of £18) to
anyone w h o joins the gliding club
this academic year.
A n introductory flight consists
of a briefing by a qualified instruc-
tor, followed by a 10-20 minute
flight (dependant on weather con-
ditions) in our two-seat training
glider. M e m b e r s h i p of ICGC allows
you to continue learning to fly in
our gliders at only 12p/minute (free
after 2 hours), and also makes y o u
a m e m b e r of L a s h a m Gliding
Society (the biggest gliding club in
the country) where w e are based.
Lasham has the best launching
facilities in the country, and our
launch fees are subsidised by the
Union giving us a 40% discount.
This means that on a g o o d day in
the Summer when flights of 5 hours
or more are possible, y o u can take
a winch launch and spend the day
racing around the countryside using
nature's energy, for less than £ 2 0 .
The best gliding weather is from
M a r c h - O c t o b e r and, although it
does take a while (40-60 flights is
average) to go solo, learning is part
of the fun. Gliding is one of the
cheapest and most enjoyable ways
of learning to fly, even at non-uni-
versity clubs where flying similar
gliders costs around three times as
much. W e also run subsidised
courses and tours during the holi-
days, and experienced members
can train to become instructors, and
take part in cross-country competi-
tions (where pilots race each other
on tasks of around 100-500km) and
aerobatics competitions.
Gliding is a satisfying, fun and
diverse sport, suiting both people
who just want to "get away from it
all" at the weekend and people w h o
want to combine exhilarating flying
with an intellectual challenge.
ICGC has the gliders, facilities and
instructors to train people from
their first flight up to solo standard
and beyond. The best example of
this is ex-student member Afandi
Darlington w h o started gliding with
ICGC and, at the end of his 4 year
Aeronautics degree, came 2nd in
the British Junior Gliding
5
Championships.
If anyone has any
questions about ICGC or
gliding in general, then E-
mail me o n Error! Bookmark not
defined, and I will be glad to help.
Alternatively, w e have weekly
meetings (Thursdays 1-2) in
Aeronautics R o o m 254 where peo-
ple can join the club, arrange to go
gliding and find out more. Our
main aims are to give everyone the
chance to find out what gliding is
like and to help people to progress
as fast as their money and free time
will allow. If y o u have any c o m -
ments and suggestions about how
w e can make gliding more accessi-
ble to students, I would be very
interested to hear them
Thanks for your time everyone,
Andy H o l m e s , ICGC.
PS. Anyone w h o would like to try
gliding, but doesn't want to "gam-
ble" their membership fee before
they find out if they like it, can book
a non-member's introductory flight
for £ 1 8 . W e will reduce your m e m -
bership fee by £9 (to £20) if you
join the club on the day of your
introductory flight.
PPS. The first 5 people to E-mail
me can have an introductory flight
and ICGC membership for £ 2 5 .
