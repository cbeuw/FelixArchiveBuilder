ROASTING - Part 1
To continue the oven theme I thought I'd d o
a little resume of roasting techniques. Roasting
is one of my favourite methods of cooking and
has loads of advantages e.g. the food tastes
great, y o u don't use m u c h fat, it's ridiculously
easy and it keeps the place w a r m .
A few general points to start with. Roasting
implies using a quick, fierce heat. For meat this
means y o u need a g o o d quality piece of around
four pounds so get s o m e friends around. The
oven needs to be very hot w h e n the food is put
in, generally 220°C, gas mark 8.
Right, first off, Beef. Suitable cuts include
sirloin (expensive), silverside and chuck. Have a
chat with your local family butcher and decide.
Whilst your oven is warming up, w i p e the joint
with a d a m p cloth, season it with salt and pep-
per and place it in a roasting tin with s o m e fat.
The best fat is of course beef dripping but but-
ter will d o I suppose. You'll need about 1 o z per
pound of beef. Put the roast into the very hot
oven and leave for 10-15 minutes to sear the
meat and then reduce to 180°C, gas mark 5.
You'll need to baste the joint every 30 minutes
to keep it nice and moist (this involves remov-
ing the joint from the oven with an appropriate
insulating thing, pouring the fat in the tin over
the meat using an large s p o o n and putting it
back in the oven).
Total cooking time = 20 minutes per lb +
10 min for joints without a bone, or 15 minutes
per lb + 15 min for joints with a bone.
Lamb. The only piece of lamb I reckon is
really worth roasting is the leg. All the other bits
are best grilled. A really tasty way of seasoning
this is to insert slivers of garlic into the leg by
cutting deep holes into it using a long thin knife
and pushing slices of garlic right d o w n the cut.
Then rub with olive oil, salt and rosemary. Place
Roast Duck (not featured on this page)
in the hot oven for 10 minutes and then reduce
the heat to 180°C, gas mark 5 for the remaining
time. N o basting involved.
Total cooking time = 25 minutes per lb +
25 min for m e d i u m cooked, 30 minutes per lb
+ 30 min for well done.
Pork. I r e c o m m e n d (but again, your local
butcher is the expert) that y o u use leg, loin or
shoulder for roasting, with or without a bone. If
you like crackling, buy a joint with its skin still on
(this also removes the need to baste the joint.
Bonus). Either way, score the top side of the
joint with a sharp knife d o w n to the flesh, rub
with oil and seasonings. You can use practically
any herb, spice or combination on pork. I'm par-
ticularly partial to a mixture of salt, pepper, cin-
namon, mustard (powder) and sugar but garlic,
cloves, bay, laurel etc ad nauseam are all excel-
lent. O n c e flavoured, put the joint in a tin and
into the oven at the usual 220°C, gas mark 8.
After 10 minutes reduce to 180°C, gas mark 5
for the rest of the cooking time. If the joint does
not have any skin, baste every 30 minutes.
Total cooking time = 35 minutes per lb +
35 min for boned joints, or 30 minutes per lb +
30 min for joints on the bone.
That's all for this week, I'll do fowl and veg-
etables next week. However, a quick w o r d on
carving (cutting up the roast): it's an extremely
complicated subject that d e m a n d s a lot of skill
and practice. Needless to say I've got neither so
I just hack whatever it is to pieces. Oddly
enough, it tastes just as g o o d .

F
reshers, R o m a n s , country-
men, pin back your ears. Land
is very expensive in London.
W e don't have nearly enough Halls
of Residence at this fine establish-
ment. This is demonstrated invari-
ably by surveys such as the Times
Good University Guide, in which
Imperial's biggest Achilles heel,
especially in deference to those
upper-crusties at Oxbridge, is its
woeful lack of a c c o m m o d a t i o n . (1
said a c c o m m o d a t i o n , not w o m e n .
Honestly, d o y o u never think about
anything else?) The unfortunate
practical upshot of this is that y o u
are going to have to find s o m e -
where to live next year. I see y o u
hadn't thought of that. Planning to
get another place in Hall were y o u ,
or just sleep on someone's floor?
Perhaps y o u could crash out in the
service duct at the end of the land-
ing. Sorry, guys, the
A c c o m m o d a t i o n Office just isn't
that philanthropic.
M o s t folk in Hall last year knew
precisely with w h o m they would be
living, when and where, by the end
of the first term. If y o u have not
considered these finer points yet, it
isn't worth e x p e n d i n g precious
adrenalin; these g o o d intentions
often falter when the individuals
involved find that rather than being
blood brothers for life, they are
utterly sick of the sight of each
other by the Summer Term. W h e n
this happens, students e n d up
sharing an expensive, draughty,
cold, Victorian flat in Earl's Court /
South Kensington / Bayswater
(delete as appropriate) with the fol-
lowing lot: one smelly heavy metal
enthusiast, complete with guitar
and 7 4 7 - s i z e amplifier; one
Engineering student with horn-
rimmed glasses, six computers and
a distinct lack of social ability; one
alcohol-blooded Southside Bar res-
ident, displaying an advanced tal-
ent for stomping up the stairs at 4
a m and managing to knock every-
thing, and I mean everything, over;
finally one trance - garage - house -
drum 'n' bass - trip hop enthusiast
with a stereo capable of shattering
Stonehenge and nine ounces of
"personal use" hashish stashed
under his bed, making everyone in
the house paranoid for their entire
tenancy. O n c e you've got the
place, the fun but starts. If your
rent includes bills, y o u are blessed
indeed; there's nothing quite like
s p e n d i n g a Sunday afternoon
analysing the 'phone bill and accus-
ing each other of spending £ 2 0 on
0 8 9 8 numbers. Expect to start get-
ting on each other's nerves by week
three - week four if y o u are
extremely lucky. If y o u are all
bruise-free by week six, consider a
career m o v e towards counselling. 1
also confidently predict that
nobody will wash up, empty the
bins, tidy the kitchen, hoover, clean
the bath and toliets, or anything
else, until blood is spilt. A n d who's
going to clean that up?
Choose insurance. Choose a TV
licence. C h o o s e paying the bills
early. Choose a house with a dish-
washer, and a lounge. Choose #50
rent per w e e k with no shared
rooms. Choose a flatmate with a
Playstation. C h o o s e the biggest
r o o m .
Frankly, after four weeks of
fruitless searching, y o u will choose
the only place y o u can get. just
don't blame me w h e n the w i n d o w s
leak.
