THA BOMBI
RIP BIGGIE SMALLS aka NOTORIOUS BIG aka CHRISTOPHER WALLACE
It's been almost a year since the death of Biggie
Smalls, aka Christopher Wallace. After the loss
of Tupac Shakur, Biggie's death • ^ • • H H H H B H
was the last thing h i p h o p ^^•^SS^fl^ff
needed. M o s t people t h o u g h t | M B B B B B B r ? f e ^
it was some sort of revenge for
2Pac, truth is, w e will never ^ j l M P i
know the true reasons for the W v B S
deaths of either rap stars.
Biggie's death w a s described j w ij^jjffjl
by many as the end of an era,
but Puffy has managed to keep g I B
the Biggie thang going even |§|||'
though the big man is a few 9mmm^- .
feet under. The question u have t o ask is has hip
hop gone anywhere - the answer is n o . The
world has gone sampling m a d , Puffy and his
sampler rule, is Puffy hip h o p or just pop, w h o
knows? M a k e ya o w n mind up.
O n a single tip I gotta mention the return of
the original first lady of soul Aretha Franklin,
she's been out of circulation for a while but n o w
she's back with A Rose is Still A Rose. The pro-
duction and writing both c o m e from M s Lauryn
Hill (from The Fugees) and she works her magic
to perfection t o bring us this wicked tune.
Release date for the album is still t o be
announced. Talking about release dates, the
Redman joint has been put back, this w o z sup-
pose to get a release at the backend of last year,
but n o . I've been waiting for this since 1 hear
Roni Size is doing some of the production, that's
right heavy, heavy beats.
Snoop Doggy D o g g has his o w n record label
now, although I a m not sure what is going o n as
he still has a contract with Death Row Records
to produce around 5 more albums. Snoop
appears o n the Caught U p soundtrack reunited
with ex-Dogg Pound rapper Kurupt, and appears
courtesy of his D o g g House Records.
I have heard there is a mix-tape going
around in Philadelphia entitled Makaveli 2 and
contains many unreleased 2Pac songs. Death
Row confirmed they are his songs and most of
them are likely t o appear o n the u p c o m i n g
Outlawz Immortalz album, d u e out o n Death
Row.
Outlawz Immortalz member Fatal Hussein,
cousin of Tupac, will release his album, and s o

floor and even in the charts
How Can I Get Over You (remix)- Taral
Funked up version utilising Total's ' N o - O n e
Else' and Luniz 'I got 5 O n It', a definite floor
filler. O h , did I mention LL helps out too?
far it sounds like he ain't all about Thug Life and
has some introspective songs with a wide range
JMUUUMJM^ of subject matter. The tracks
«•:' <
Hfaj- are supposed to be bangin'.
Speaking of Death R o w ,
they have been d r o p p e d by
Interscope d u e to pressure
•V'..$!IWfr)fc. • from 50% stakeholder Seagram.
H [ [ * l
N W P B W y Seagram claimed that Death
mm Row were providing a bad influ-
mBk ence to children with 'gangsta
rap'. This coming from a c o m -
P * K pany that produce alcohol!
* * S u g e r Knight, the incarcerated
C E O of Death Row Records, said that they will
sign a project-by-project distribution deal with a
major distribution company. There are rumours,
though, that with all of the legal troubles of
Death Row, Suge Knight will form a new c o m p a -
ny but it should be business as usual.
M o r e Tupac news... apparently Afeni Shakur,
his mother, has dropped the case against Death
Row Records after over 100 of his unreleased
songs were given over t o her. Also, Tupac's
father was suing his estate for half his money but
the case was thrown out as he had hardly been
in 'Pac's life and only contributed around $ 2 0
his whole life!!! Greedy huh? Check this out for
greedy... C . Delores Tucker, forever campaign-
ing against gnagsta rap, w a s suing Tupac's
estate for damages to her sex life after the songs
How Do You Want It and Wonda Why They Call
U Bytch. The former contains the rhyme ' C .
Delores Tucker you a motherfucker/Instead of
trying to help a nigga y o u destroy a brotha'. The
other song is actually telling a young girl w h o is
selling her body to give it up and g o to school
and make something of herself.

Trie story goes a little .sumtin' like this : in the
early nineties, four guys from Phiily decided t o
get together and voila, w e have the multi-plat-
'• i i I1
.i group Boyz li M e n . Their dodgy
afro's and preppie clothes may not appeal t o
all but one things for sure, they can sing....and
sing real weil too as demonstrated on this, their
sophomore set, released in 1994.
Collaborations with the likes of Dallas
Austin, jimmy jam &. Terry Lewis and the pro-
duction master Babyface led to four hit singles
- the ballads I'll Make Love to You (the biggest
selling single in America of ali time). Water
Runs Dry and On Bended Knee as well as the
spunky Thank You. Virtually every cut on the on
the alburn has quality written all over it, notably
Vlbin' and the Brain McKnight penned Tallin'.
Tight melodies, incredible harmonies, (check
the accapeiia Yesterday if y o u disagree).
Shawn, Nate, Wanya and Michael are clearly
the best R'n'B group out there. Accept no
watered down substitutes this is the real deal,
y'all. Gloria

LL Cool J
film
LL Cool J is possibly the most recog-
nised rap artist in the world today, at the
age of 2 8 his list of accomplishments seem
too long for one so y o u n g : 2-time Grammy
award winner, six consecutive platinum
selling albums, star of hit television show,
actor, author, father and husband. Some
call him the undisputed king of hip-hop, maybe
that's a little too much, but he's certainly a hip-
hop sensation. LL is doin' it and doin' it and
doin' it well.
LL was born James T o d d Smith, but before
long he had created his o w n stage name LL Cool
J, and acronym for "Ladies Love Cool James". At
9 he was rapping and at 13 had already pro-
duced numerous demos, he sent off tape after
tape in hope of a recording contract, the only
label to
r e s p o n d
was the
then tiny
Def Jam.
LL hit the
scene in
1984, at
the age
of 16 he
was the
first artist
to release a single o n the n o w legendary label
Def Jam, / Need A Beat. The following year saw
him release his first album, described by the crit-
ics as the most original album of the time Radio.
Suddenly LL was thrust into the public eye and
the following summer he went o n tour with the
biggest rappers, Run D M C . His second set took
a while to hit the streets but Bigger and Deffer
didn't disappoint, at the same time he also
delivered the hit single / Need Your Love. LL's
profile was large. LL's 1989 album Walking With
a Panther was considered by most as the worst
thing he had ever done and there was talk that
LL had lost it. This talk was quickly dismissed
with his next album when he got together with
Marley Marl for the hugely successful Mama
Said Knock You Out, this set re-established LL in
the hip hop world. Mama Said., featured the
wicked Around The Way Girl, a top ten smash,
LL w o n his first G r a m m y for Best Rap Solo. 1993
saw the release of 14 Shots to the Dome, this
was real weak in comparison to his previous
effort, but still reached platinum, to make it five
in a row for him. Next up was Mr Smith, this fea-
tured the classic Hey Lover, this song featured
the vocal styling of R&JB group Boyz II M e n . Hey
Lover ended up being one of the biggest tunes
LL had ever made and also gave him his second
G r a m m y award. Along with Hey .. the
album also featured Doin' It and Loungin',
all these went to making Mr Smith LL's
biggest selling album to date. LL's latest
offering is Phenomenon this is not in the
class of Mr Smith, but LL has high hopes for
the singles after they get the remix treat-
ment. Milen
