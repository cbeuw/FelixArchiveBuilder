REVIEW
ULTIM@TE
RACE PRO
PC • • •
If you've just blown £ 1 5 0 on
the latest 3D graphics card, what
you want is a game that will s h o w
the power and quality of your pur-
chase. Costing a paltry £ 1 9 . 9 9 ,
Ultim@te Race Pro aims to be that
game.
There is no plot - w h o needs
one anyway? - apart from driving
around very quickly and beating
your opponents. The graphics are
very slick on accelerated PCs, hap-
pily over 30 frames per second
with gorgeous detail and shading.
There's even a c o n v i n c i n g and
atmospheric storm weather, and
the transition between night and
day is handled very smoothly.
In addition to fog the effects
include sun glare, projected shad-
ows and fairly realistic headlights
to boot.
The car han-
dling is a little flat lv
and lacking in
personality, but
still proves to be
enjoyable.
The game falls
flat w h e n it
comes to reward- • acjMMjj
ing the player's
success. Finishing
a race will only
bring an uninspir-
ing "you've w o n " message. There
is no championship m o d e , and no
hidden tracks or cars to be discov-
ered.
The basic engine is there, and
very well polished it is too, but per-
haps a couple of months worth of
finishing off is needed. What a
shame.
To quote the Hitch-hiker's
Guide: "it looks like a fish, moves
like a fish and steers like a c o w . "

3D HARDWARE
Let's face it, the only way to play
today's 3D games is with the funky
hardware accelerators available.
Here are some of the new chipsets
on the way...
3DFX VOODOO 2
The V o o d o o looks like it will be the
best board available, with two tex-
ture processors a n d 2 M b of
memory each. A d d another 2 M b
of video memory and its quite a
package. The downside is that it
will probably be in the most expen-
sive cards.
NEC POWERVR 2
M u c h improved from the original
board, P o w e r V R ' s key features
include full-scene anti-aliasing
(smoothing) and Texture
C o m p r e s s i o n , m e a n i n g higher
quality graphics all round. Its likely
that these boards should be a bit
cheaper than 3Dfx-based systems.
INTEL 740
Intel, not happy with its d o m i n a -
tion in motherboards alone, is
entering the 3D market with this
impressive m i d - e n d chipset. The
740 will only work with Pentium II
systems and should handle 200-
800 thousand polygons a second
(significantly less than 3Dfx and
NEC). However, this card should
represent very g o o d value for
money and will probably find its
way into motherboards, making it
the standard for 3D graphics.

The catch is that y o u need to
review them for Felix. If you're

GAMING NEWS
PlayStation owners w h o wish to
revel in the 70's M a d Max-styled
fun that is Interstate '76 may be in
for a shock. Bizarrely, the game
has be re-titled Vigilante 8 and
seems to has lost its 70's groove.
Car-based combat and mayhem
seem assured, however, so all is
not lost it seems.
PC flight simulators seem to have
run out of planes to showcase, to
the point that F-22 Raptor centres
around a plane that's only barely in
production, and won't be in gen-
eral use until the next century.
Regrettably, the game has no sup-
port for hardware accelerated 3D,
so those of us without the latest
Pentiums could feel let d o w n .
Speaking of which, as if 3 3 3 H z
w a s n ' t fast e n o u g h , Intel has
announced that it plans to have
450-500Hz Pentium lis shipping
within the next 5 months. Given
the size of the heatsinks on the
current chips, one wonders if an
integrated processor &. central
heating s y s t e m is also in the
pipeline...
Quake 2 multi-player addicts will
be retreating to their bedrooms
once more with the release of
Quake 2 CTF - 'Capture The Flag'
levels. Those w h o were disap-
pointed with the standard game's
multi-player levels should seize the
new challenge eagerly.
Nintendo 64 owners will finally be
getting a fighting game to write
h o m e about in Fighters Destiny.
Featuring a novel points system
rather than the more usual "batter
opponent until they fall over" fare,
Fighters should provide a welcome
change from the cutesey game
normally available on Nintendo's
software-starved console.
Congratulations to ex-Felix editor

Editor. Have a pint on us, mate...
O r U K I O
EA Sports report that they have
signed top golfer Tiger Woods to
help develop an interactive golf
game. Tiger and his sponsor Nike
are likely to appear in the next ver-
sion of PGA Tour.
