IC Boat Club success at Duisberg
DUISBURG INTERNATIONAL
REGATTA 1 9 9 6
Imperial College Boat Club came
through strongly in the
International regatta at Duisberg
at the end of last month. The
World's premier crews assem-
bled at the German International
rowing course: the Olympic
squads from all the major rowing
nations competed in what will be
one of the last events before the
Atlanta Games.
Imperial College and Queens
Tower Boat Clubs (IC old boys)
sent four crews, consisting of two
Senior Coxed Fours and an U23
Quad and Coxless Four. Racing
at this level is the toughest com-
petition that the IC crews have
ever encountered. The U23
Coxless Four surpassed them- Four, reducing the previous
selves in winning their event. record set by the IC
Their winning time made them
the fastest Imperial Coxless
Commonwealth Games bronze
medalist in 1994 by one second.
The U23 Quad finished
third on Saturday, and racing as
a senior boat on Sunday just
failed to make the final, being
beaten by the American World
Championship finalists by only 4
seconds. In the Senior Coxed
Fours the Queens Tower crew
made the Final on Saturday but
were unlucky to miss qualifying
on the Sunday.
The Imperial boat, which is
presently seeking selection as the
Great Britain Coxed Four for the
World Championship this year,
qualified for the final on both
days. They finished a close sec-
ond on the Saturday and a slight-
ly disappointing fourth on the
Sunday. The Germans won the
event on both days.
