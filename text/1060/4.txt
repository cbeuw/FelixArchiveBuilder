past the Treasury

and listen closely. On a good day
you can just about make out a
chorus of Treasury officials
indoctrinating yet another public
sector body with the PFI mantra
- a Syren's tune that draws lis-
teners into a world populated by
'value for money service
providers', 'efficient risk alloca-
tion' and 'specified outputs'.
select committee report believes
this to be be overly optimistic.
To date, the largest projects are
transport related, with £2.9bn of
the current £5bn worth of PFI
projects coming form one
scheme alone - the channel tun-
nel rail link.
T
he scheme is promoted
nationwide by the Private
Finance Panel - a sort of
ture expansion, independent of
the external constraints imposed
by government budgets.
However, rather than popularis-
ing the scheme, it has lead to
greater confusion amongst offi-
cials at universities, because they
say the Treasury has not under-
stood their status. Crucially, says
Mike Hansen, Director of
Finance for Imperial, "they do
not appear to know that universi-

T
he PFI (Private Finance
Initiative), introduced in
1992, is a scheme that
envisages more efficient public
service provision through part-
nership with the private sector.
Private companies now build,
maintain and operate services
such as roads, hospitals and pris-
ons, in return for a service pay-
ment. The assumption is that
the private sector is better
equipped to deal with certain
risks and complications in build-
ing large projects (the £500m
overspend on The British
Library would support this
hypothesis). Further, they can
bring innovation in design and
deliver at a price which repre-
sents good value for money com-
pared to a purely publicly fund-
ed and operated option.
T
he Initiative is projected
to grow significantly: the
Treasury's own target is
for £14bn worth of deals by
1999, but a recent Treasury

keys; however, despite their best
evangelical efforts, there are
clearly problems. The appoint-
ment this week of a new
Chairman to the PFI panel, Ross
Goobey (the third in six
months); the withdrawal of Bovis
from the Initiative, citing com-
plexities in the bidding process
and excessive bureaucracy, and
relaxation of some of the
Treasury guidelines, are all testa-
ment to this.
I
n a valiant drive to widen the
influence of the initiative,
pressure is now being put on
HE institutions to test their pro-
jects for its application.
Universities are currently
exempt from a mandatory test to
determine if the proposed pro-
ject is suitable for private sector
involvement. Supporters claim
that it will enable universities to
be equipped with the most mod-
ern facilities and plan infrastruc-
ty borrowing does not affect the
public deficit at all," thus invali-
dating the covert reason for the
scheme's introduction.
U
niversities had assumed
that the government
was tacitly acknowledg-
ing that HE institutions aren't
really in the public sector by
excluding them from the manda-
tory PFI test. That they get sig-
nificant funding from the
Treasury is irrelevant.
Universities are self governing
establishments, and as Mike
Hansen states, "it's got nothing
to do with the government,
where we get our money from.
We can go to a bank, borrow
from the bond market or use the
PFI; it just depends on each
case." Mike Hansen epitomises
the pragmatic view: the PFI may
be useful for some projects, but
because universities have not his-
torically operated under public
sector constraints, the scheme
doesn't offer anything new.
