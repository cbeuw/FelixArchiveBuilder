Cool things to do with any left over student
loan, #1: buy a work of art.
1,300 works of art are on display in what is an
utterly overwhelming exhibition. Paintings,
prints, sculpture and arcliitectural designs
cram the walls of 13 galleries, floor to ceiling.
There is a massive range: eveiything from 6-
foot carbon and steel sculpture to tiny minia-
ture portraits.
The exhibition also features a fascinating range
of architectural models, including the rejected
Cardiff opera house plan, the Millenium
wheel proposed for the South Bank, and the
new Wellcome wing of the Science museum.
