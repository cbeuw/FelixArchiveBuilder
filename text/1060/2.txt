Members of STOIC, the Student
Television Of Imperial College,
have been celebrating success in
the annual student TV awards
ceremony hosted by in Norwich
by the University of East Anglia's
student television station.
STOIC have been singled out in
two categories: Best Live
Coverage and Best News
Coverage.
Carlo Masserella, STOIC's
Chair, said that the awards were
"good for STOIC," and that he
was pleased that people are
getting some recognition for their
efforts. Mr Masserella himself
won the Best News Coverage
award for a short article about
the Internet, while the other
award was won for the live cover-
age of the band Urban Spice by a
team comprising Robin Riley,
Piers Williams, Eliott Parish and
Mark Brown. The conference,
under the auspices of NaSTA,
the National Student T V
Association, invited professional
journalists to judge the entries
for the 15 categories.
Other awards were scooped
up by Birmingham's student TV,
UEA's Nexus, and the rest by
Glasgow University's GUST,
one of the largest and better
equipped student television
stations in the country.
"Compared to STOIC, GUST is
a much larger operation," said
Robin Riley, Features Editor of
STOIC. "STOIC's strengths are
in editing, which is at least five
years ahead of everyone else," he
continued, pointing out that
whereas most student TV is done
by media students, often for part
of their degree, STOIC's efforts
were by relative amateurs.
Their entries into the
competition were a bit of an after
thought, according to Mr Riley:
"We were surprised to win
anything this year, as we didn't
go. The tapes were sent off out
of tradition really." He explained
that their absence from the
conference was due to a disagree-
ment over the ethos of the
awards, and that while STOIC
made TV for broadcasting - both
their entries were programmes
which had been broadcast - some
stations had "very obviously
made programmes specifically to
win awards."
Mr Riley said that he felt
that this went against the spirit
of NaSTA, and was not what
they wanted to do in STOIC,
and whilst they were pleased to
win the awards, "they don't
really mean anything to us."

risky business" he said, compar-
ing Ariane 5 to the Space Shuttle
disaster. "There's no reason why
this one should have been any
more dangerous than subsequent
ones."
The European Space Agency
Cluster mission was due to spend
the next two years in orbit
around earth to study the inter-
action between the solar wind
and the earth's magnetic field -
the magnetosphere - which
protects the earth from sun's
more violent outbursts. These
observations would give scien-
tists a better understanding of
space 'weather'. They hoped to
resolve unanswered questions on
how the sun causes phenomena
in earth's environment such as
the aurora, power surges in trans-
mission lines and disturbances in
broadcasting.
Cluster was a unique
mission described as a corner-
stone experiment by space scien-
tists. "It would have been enor-
mous." said Dr Dunlop. "The

IC Boat Club's coach, Steve Ellis,
has been selected for the British
lightweight four entering this
summer's Atlanta Olympics.
Trials were held in Lucerne last
weekend: Steve told Felix that it
was '99% certain' he would be
chosen. "We rowed better on
Friday and Saturday than we
have done in two years, though
we almost ballsed it up on
Sunday," he said. Describing the
selection as being 'unfeasibly
competitive' he explained that
there is only one lightweight
men's boat entering, providing
only four spaces for Britain's top
11-stone or under rowers. "You
can't afford to have one bad
day," he said.
IC Boat club manager Bill
Mason's women's eight will be
competing for a place in Atlanta
in the Olympic regatta this
weekend.

Delegates at Tuesday's Imperial
College Union Council were

only way to get details of the
three dimensional structure of
the magnetosphere is to have
four spacecraft. Previous
missions with only one or two
spacecraft could only give
limited results."
It is too early to say what
will happen to the Cluster
mission next. According to Chris
Carr the fundamental need for
this research still exists and this
research cannot be done in any
other way "Its difficult to know
what will happen. Somebody will
have to decide whether this
science is important enough to
launch another mission"
Dr Dunlop is optimistic
about the future. He pointed out
that although the spacecraft were
lost, allthe research and develop-
ment has been done. "Its rather
like paying someone to develop
some software for ten years and
then throwing the computer out
of the window - luckily the soft-
ware was backed up, but we need
someone to pay for a new
computer!"

President Ghassan Karian. Mr
Karrian left his job last week to
take up a position as a
campaigner for the Labour Party.
The anouncement of the
move less than a fortnight after
his successor, ICU president
Sarah White, was elected has
been described as "cynical and
manipulative" by a ULU spokes-
man. Ghassan was elected to
continue in his present position
until the end of July, and
although he has resigned his
salary, he retains his job status
whilst working full-time as
General Election Campaign
Coordinator for the West
London area for the Labour
Party.
Representatives at the
Council meeting were deterred
from pushing for a no-confidence
vote only by virtue of the fact
that it would make the job
handover for Sarah even more
difficult than it is already. "I
think I would have had a nervous
breakdown," Miss White com-
mented.
