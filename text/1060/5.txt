O
f course, cuts in the cap-
ital grant, which thus far
amount to 33% this year
and a further 20% for next year
could force the universities'
hand, but this, M i k e Hansen
believes, simply reinforces the
cynical view, that the PFI is
largely to reduce the govern-
ment's public deficit. The cur-
rent round of gladiatorial effi-
ciency savings at the Treasury
M
ike Hansen concedes,
however, that the PFI
can deliver benefits
through sharing risks and/or
costs, and its introduction does at
least offer another possible solu-
tion. PFI type deals have seen
services such as car parking con-
tracted out to private operators -
hardly the stuff to whip up con-
troversy in the S C R - but what
Biomedical Sciences building,
funded partly by a H E F C E grant
and partly f r o m the College's
reserves, provides evidence that
there are easier options than the
PFI for the university sector. The
PFI is currently the least pre-
ferred option.
T
he mantra does have an
appealing line, otherwise
the other parties wouldn't
have joined the chorus proclaim-
will put more pressure on the
institutions to charge student's
fees at a fair rate, giving them
control over their own income.
P
rofessor N o r m a n G o w a r ,
Principal of Royal
H o l l o w a y and B e d f o r d
N e w College, sums up the cur-
rent quandary: "the current
[funding | system has all the dis-
advantages of a market system,
with none of the advantages."
Furthermore, PFI-type projects
are not new in the university sec-
tor, as M i k e Hansen states, "we
have operated a c o m m o n heating
system with the museums for
thirty five years, and a c o m m o n
library with the science museum
for the last three years. This isn't
revolutionary, it's c o m m o n
sense." It's relevance is further
undermined by the evidence of
the growth of the new universi-
ties, who took advantage of the
1992 borrowing regulations and
embarked on large expansion
programmes.
would you think if your lab was-
n't o w n e d by the College? W o u l d
you feel less secure if a private
operator was running your hall of
residence?
O
ne extreme view envis-
aged by mass use of the
PFI sees universities as
virtual entities, merely enabling
the provision of teaching and
research through private agree-
ments, rather than asset owning
providers - there are already
plans for an entire campus to be
constructed in this way. Such a
vision is unlikely to become real-
ity in institutions such as
Imperial, where private firms
cannot provide the high quality
demanded, for the simple reason
that no such firms exist at the
moment. The College is certainly
not prepared to risk its reputa-
tion by entering into long term
deals with untried firms w h i c h
nobody has experience in negoti-
ating, simply to impress Treasury
officials. T h e controversial
ing it in the same visionary terms
as the government. But the solu-
tion to capital financing in the
H E sector cannot be divorced
from the whole problem of stu-
dent finances. O n l y when the
Dearing Committee's report is
published next summer will insti-
tutions be able to make coherent
long term plans.
T
here is no doubt that sen-
sible and relevant co-oper-
ation between public and
private sector can deliver the
benefits that the PFI claims. The
Initiative in particular needs to
gain wider private sector
approval. So long as cynicism
pervades the interpretation
behind the scheme, it will take
more than the H a p p y Clappers
of Whitehall to ensure its long
term success.
