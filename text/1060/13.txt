film: from dusk till dawn
spooky
The Tarantino backlash pauses momentarily
with the release ofFrom Dusk Till Damn. Having
practically exhausted the potential of the gang-
ster film he has moved onto the horror genre and
in particular vampires.
George Clooney (ER) and Quentin
Tarantino play Seth and Rich Gecko, a pair of
murderous brothers fleeing for the sanctuary of
Mexico. En route they take hostage a faithless
preacher (Harvey Keitel) and his children
(Juliette Lewis and Ernest Hu). Once across the
border, they hole up in a sleazy strip joint called
the Titty Twister, which also happens to be the
home of a brood of blood-thirsty vampires.
The film can be split into two essentially dif-
ferent segments with only thefiveprincipal char-
acters to link them. The first half is basically a
road-movie as the two brothers cut a bloody
swathe in their run for the border. The second
half, however, is one long extended fight
sequence as they fight for their lives against the
blcKxl-sucking fiends. The basic flaw with the
film is that the two sections are too dissimilar to
work well with the other. Luckily, both have
enough merits in their own right to compensate
for the disjointedness.
The first section is the moretighdywritten
and directed of the two, allowing us to famil-
iarise ourselves with die characters before all hell
breaks lose. Unlike Tarantino's mobster heroes
of his earlier films we are given little reason to
like the Gecko brothers and for the first half of
the film it is they who are the bad guys. With rel-
atively little action going on Robert Rodriguez
(the director) has had to restrict his normally
flamboyant directing style and has consequently
had to redirect his talent.
The second section lets Rodriguez off the
leash and shows him in his tme element. At this
point, the film loses all originality, but remains
entertaining enough for this to be of little conse-
quence (providing you are not averse to a bit of
blood and gore). There are, however, enough
nice touches, mainly humorous for it to never get
boring or particularly sickening despite the high
gore content. The fact that they arefightingvam-
pires has very little importance, apart from sev-
eral Peter Gashing jokes, as it is merely an excuse
to kill monsters in as bloody and violent a way as
possible.
Although not up to Tarantino's early films,
From Dusk Till Dawn is a highly entertaining
film which shows what Robert Rodriguez can
really do given half a chance.

film: the juror
The Juror is a courtroom drama with a differ-
ence. Unlike most films of this type, which deal
with the defendant and their lawyer, it revolves
around the life of a juror, Annie Laird (Demi
Moore). Annie, an artist and single mother, sees
her life change dramatically when she is chosen
to serve as a juror in a trial of a powerful mobster,
Louie Boffano.
"She is at a point
in her life where
she's a little bored
and looking for a
distraction," says
Moore. "Being a
juror doesn't
seem to be harm-
ful, and it will
momentarily take
her out of what
she perceives as
her humdrum
life."
Alec Baldwin
plays The
Teacher, hired by
the mob to help
them win the
case by tampering
with the jury. He
'selects' Annie,
and forces her to influence the other jurors to
reach a 'not guilty' verdict. To do this, he first
befriends his 'pupil' by buying a few pieces of her
artwork - strange looking wooden boxes, whose
contents are supposed to be felt, not seen. Then
he threatens to kill her son Oliver (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt), if she does not cooperate with
him.
Annie's best friend Juliet soon becomes tan-
gled in The Teacher's web of deceit, and after
spending the night with her, he forces her to kill
herself; as a warning to Annie. Fearing that he
will kill her son as well, Annie takes her son to
Mexico, where
the final scenes
are set. However,
the main focus of
the film is not the
courtroom but
rather Annie's
home life. As
Annie, Moore
makes an unusual
single mother, but
a likeable charac-
ter, who captures
the audience's
empathy from
the outset.
Although some
parts of the film
are unconvincing,
and Annie
appears to devel-
op a superstrong
personality, it
contains a few surprising twists, which keep you
on the edge of your seat.
This is nothing compared to the quality of
some of the films released recendy, but it is eas-
ily worth the price of a cinema ticket.
