crux oi the
matter
Dear Felix,
PLEASE GIVE OUR
CRUTCHES BACK
The Health Centre has a
policy of lending crutches to
those who need them in
exchange for a deposit of £50.
However, because the need for
crutches usually arises after an
accident, very few patients have
£50 cash or chequebooks on
their person. In these cases we
have lent the crutches anyway,
asking the patient to sign a
pledge to return them as soon as
possible afier the patient has
recovered.
We started this academic
year with f6 pairs of crutches.
Now we have 3 odd ones. Since
each pair costs £60, this is a sig-
nificant loss to the Health
Centre, as well as depriving oth-
ers of this service
We would like our crutches
back. To this end, we propose an
amnesty. Please return any
crutches in your possession by
Friday 14 June 1996 and we will
cross your name off our black
list. After that date we shall
regard any non-return of crutch-
es as theft of college property
and will pass on our list to the
Acadeinic Registrar asking himto
invoke regulation for students
number 2. This means that once
students reach their final year,
no degree will be awarded until
the debt has been settled.
We are also writing to all
those who borrowed crutches
and have not returned them.
This will demonstrate that we
know who they are.
Dr. Irene Weinreb
Director,
Clinical Services

Blame. Great fun to distribute.
I've thrown it at various groups
of IC staff so I reckon it's about
time I blamed the students.
Let me tell you a little story.
Once upon a time I was an
undergraduate at Imperial. I was-
n't a very good one, but I wasn't
so appalling as to cause a fuss.
Falling into that great mass of the
high 2:2 / low 2:1, it's very easy
to drift along unnoticed. But all
was quite happy until I got to the
end of my second year (by which
time my course was, getting a lit-
tle tricky). I failed a paper, bring-
ing my aggregate below that
acceptable level of mediocrity
which apparently determines a
student's ability to survive in
Europe for a year.
I was very disappointed, so I
phoned up the relevant member
of staff to talk about it. He had
no difficulty in giving me an
explanation for his decision, and
he said some very unpleasant
things about it. No, that's not
quite true. He was arrogant,
patronising, unspeakably rude,
insulting, unsympathetic and
generally abusive. He told me I
was 'a failure and a liability to my
department.'
So what did I do, you ask?
Well, I took it further. I told my
friends. I told my friends'
friends, and their cousins. My
Granny's next-door neighbour's
cleaning lady knew. I talked to
my brother on the phone for an
hour about it. (He was in Hong
Kong on holiday at the time).
But did I tell anyone useful? Did
I buggery. I don't know why. I
think I was embarrassed.
In the light of the exception-
ally noisy building work outside
the library I phoned up the sub-
librarian last week, all set to
demand explanations for the cav-
alier disregard for students' revi-
sion. But it was difficult to main-
tain my argument when he told
me that no one had complained
at all. I went into a meeting with
Ian Caldwell this week's looking
for justification for the appalling
way students in Weeks had been
treated. He was very concerned,
but not only had he just found
out, the Weeks' warden had no
idea that students were unhappy
either.
Look, folks, we cannot keep
whinging. Call me hopeful, but I
reckon that relevant, construc-
tive complaint might achieve
something. You're going to have
to trust me on this one, but there
really are some genuinely
decent, dedicated, caring staff
out there. Use them: I never did,
and I wish I had. It might not
have made any difference, but it
might have stopped me wallow-
ing (and fuming!) quite so much.
