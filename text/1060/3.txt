NEWS FELIX FRIDAY JUNE 7TH 1 9 9 6 . THREE
Weeks awakes to morning chorus
BY ALEX FEAKES
Residents in Weeks Hall have
relief from three weeks of build-
ing in sight this week, as a project
to open up Imperial's newly
acquired garden behind the hall
draws to a close. Workmen are
creating a path alongside the
Hall, but have raised the ire of
students in the hall who are
trying to study for their summer
examinations.
The students have been
driven to complain because the
work has continued right into the
exam period, when the original
notice that they were given,
dated May 15th, said that it
should have been completed
within a week. The problem had
been aggravated by the hot
weather, when students often
have their windows open, and the
pressure on space in other study
areas on campus.
Talking to Felix, residents in
the rooms facing the new garden
explained how initially the noise
hadn't been that much of a prob-
lem, but when mechanical
diggers and circular saws started
being used, the level of noise just
got too much. "They start at
eight sometimes," said one,
speaking loudly above the grind-
ing of a paving slab being cut, "we
raised a petition, and gave it to
the housekeeper, but we were
told to take it further."
Indeed, someone did take it
further, responding to a spoof
poster placed about the hall
showing the telephone number
for Ian Caldwell, "Director of
Revision," and rang up the
College's Director of Estates.
Mr Caldwell said that it was
the lirst he had heard of the
problems, saying that the
students hadn't even spoken to
their Warden about it. But he
outlined some proposals on how
they planned to alleviate the
noise, including having set times
for slab cutting and digging, or
relocating the cutting to some-
where else. He stressed that "We
are sensitive to exam pressures,
although some students may not
believe that."
The gardens behind the Hall
were purchased by the College a
few months ago as a possible site
for an underground sports centre.
Mr Caldwell is keen to encourage
people to use the gardens for
study, and the new path is meant
to provide access. PHOTO: ALEX FEAKES
UCAS director advises
students: do it now
BY THE NEWS TEAM
Students should expect to pay
fees from 1997 according to the
Chairman of the Universities and
Colleges Admissions Service. In a
statement this week Tony
Higgins urged school-leavers not
to deier entry.
Each year, 40,000 students
resit their exams to try and
improve their grades and go to
their course of choice. This year,
students are being recommended
to take an alternative course
rather than resit. "We are saying,
if you have a place this year you
should take it, otherwise you
might be caught out by a fee next
year," said Mr Higgins.
The recommendations come
during a climate of funding cuts
in the higher education system.
A report published by the Higher
Education Funding Council for
England (HEFCE) this week
revealed that 79 per cent of UK
science, medicine and engineer-
ing departments have been
unable to perform critical exper-
iments due to cuts in Higher
Education funding.
This news will add to the
hardship of students who already
have threats of a graduate tax and
the abolishing of grants hanging
over their heads. In a meeting of
the Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principals
(CVCP) in February, top-up fees
of up to £3000 a year had been
suggested. At present IC has no
plans to charge students.

ICU Council this week approved plans lor the refurbishment and
expansion of the Ents lounge. "It's about time!" commented Ents
manager Mark Home, "It means that that maybe Ents will be taken
more seriously at Imperial, and will bring the Ents here in line with
other London Colleges". The £109,000 refit is due to be completed
by the second week in September. Although offering a minimal
increase in capacity, "it will provide a vast improvement in the stan-
dard of service," a thrilled Mark said.
