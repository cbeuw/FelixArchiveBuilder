Chance' and 'Dusty' pick up where the huge hit
from 1994's 'Superunknown' album, 'Black
Hole Sun', left off, using Beades-style psyche-
delic touches to enhance their anthemic quali-
ties. 'Never The Machine Forever', on the other
hand, is a heavy metal workout that harks back
to the heady days of old. But it's on the punk
rock pieces such as 'No Attention' and 'Ty Cobb'
that the (Sound)garden really begins to look rosy.
The latter particularly shines as Chris Cornell
and Ben Shepherd partake in some frenetic
mandolin picking over the traditional boisterous
electric guitars to create one of those hitherto
rare things - a lighthearted Soundgarden song.
Herein lies the secret of this band's longevi-
ty. Where Nirvana and Pearl Jam seemed
depressed at Ureir success, Soundgarden have
finally learned 1 > enjoy it to such an extent that
on ibis album the\ sound relaxed and comfort-
abltifltt spaRliallenging. Much of the music
press Still mistakenly label them 'Frowngarden',
one of the most miserable bands on the planet.
