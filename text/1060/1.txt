£6 million blown in Ariane disaster
As it should have been: Ariane 501 in launch.
BY BEN WILK1NS
Scientists from Imperial watched
with horror as 10 years' work was
wiped out in seconds last
Tuesday when the Ariane 5
rocket, on its maiden flight,
exploded during its launch. On
board were the four Cluster
spacecraft carrying instruments
designed and built by a team led
by Imperial.
Ariane 5 took off from
Kourou in French Guiana at 1:35
GMT. But just 27 seconds into
the flight, a guidance system
fault caused the 750 tonne
rocket to veer wildly off course.
The rocket started to break up
30 seconds later and ground
controllers decided to end the
mission for safety reasons. Two
explosions were triggered in the
main fuel tanks, destroying the
rocket and its £500 million cargo.
On the launch pad, jubilation
turned to dismay as scientists
watched the burning debris rain
back down to earth.
Malcolm Dunlop from the
Physics department, one of the
investigators involved in the clus-
ter mission, was watching the
launch via a satellite link up at
the Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory in Oxfordshire. His
initial reaction was one of 'disbe-
lief. The overall cost of the
project was over £6 million and
scientists and engineers have
been designing and building the
the instruments in the Physics
department since 1988.
Chris Carr, a research offi-
cer who helped to build the
instruments, was watching the
launch from the European Space
Operations Centre in Darmstadt,
where the mission would have
been controlled from. "We
didn't have a very good view. At
first a lot of us thought we had
just lost the picture. When we
saw the flaming fragments
coming down, we realised that
was it. Then there was complete
silence for what seemed like a
very long time"
Ariane 5 was the first of a
new generation of satellite
launchers, the most powerful
ever built by ESA. This, the first
flight, was officially experimen-
tal, and the decision to launch
the Cluster mission on it was
partly in order to keep the cost
down. But Malcolm Dunlop
insists that the decision to put
the satellites on a test flight was
the correct one. "Rocketry is a
