to offer ‘off-quota’ places where UK
students are charged over-sea student
prices. The proposal was branded as a
chance for richer students to ‘buy’ their
way into universities, though the gov-
ernment denies this.
David Willetts proposed that univer-
sities could offer places for over-sea
student prices, outside the government
loans system. This was in response to
the burden on the government to pay out
a much larger proportion of money on
loans due to the tuition costs.
So it seems that at this juncture in
the ongoing debate about higher edu-
cation, it is simultaneously being sug-
gested that students from lower finan-
cial backgrounds could risk everything
for cheaper fees and that rich students
could ‘buy’ their way into courses,
which makes you wonder: what on earth
is going on?
form, guarantee the highest teaching
standards for next year.
In his President’s Report to Union
Council, Alex Kendall claims that the
removal of modules proposed by the
review is in conflict with promises made
byProfessorMargaretDallman,Principal
of the Faculty of Natural Sciences, to
the July 2010 College Council that “the
experience of students in Life Sciences
should not be unduly affected by this
restructuring”. He also pointed to a note
sent by the Department of Life Science
to the College Senate stating that the
Department did “not anticipate that
the review [would] lead to a reduction
in the contact hours or module choice
experienced by students.” Given that
Dallman confirmed that the restructure
was “progressing according to plan” to
the November 2010 Council, a week
before the Life Science redundancies
were announced, Kendall alleged that
Dallman “misinformed [the Council] at
their July meeting” with regard to the
effect of this plan on teaching.
Kendall’s President’s Report
suggested the Union “making a formal
complaint about the Restructure panel”
but Kendall has since informed Felix
that he has been told that “there is
no mechanism for students to make
formal complaints about members of
staff”. A Union submission to the panel
concerning the modules to be scrapped,
however, has resulted in a number of
them reappearing in the final review

document published last week.
Professor Dallman declined to
address Kendall’s accusations directly
but said that the proposals put forward
by the Teaching Review would increase
student choice, allowing them to choose
from six options rather than four or five
currently and said that the plans would
see an increase in the amount of small
group teaching.
Kendall was also critical of the
proposals presented by the Teaching
Review. The draft review document
published in March [1] proposed a
reduction in the number of final year
Biology and Biochemistry modules.
Among those to be cut were Animal
Behaviour and all existing plant based
modules, though some new courses,
including Pathogens and Mutualists,
were also introduced. The review
document also suggested that Life
Sciences stop teaching Biomedical
Science, a course run jointly by the
Department of Life Sciences and the
Faculty of Medicine. The draft review
proposes withdrawing the course as
soon as October 2012, stating that
it does not believe that “teaching on
the Biomedical Science degree is an
optimal use of our resources”. The draft
review claims that the loss of the 50
students who take Biomedical Science
each year will allow an uptake of an
additional 24 people to the Biology
degree: “ideally those who express
organismal/ecological, rather than
cellular/biochemical, interests”.
Professor Dallman told Felix that
no long-term decision had been made
yet regarding the Biomedical Science
degree and that such a decision would
be made in consultation with the Faculty
of Medicine.
These issues were discussed at
the Science Studies Committee last
Tuesday. Deputy President (Education)
Alex Dahinten said that the committee,
which exists to maintain high teaching
standards, would not allow “anything
sub-par to pass” and that the ball was in
the Department’s court. The committee
has given the Department until the 24th
of May to answer their concerns.

New Arabic course
Student Switch off
Imperial 10th in UK
according to Guardian
The Humanities Department have
announced that from October
2011 it will offer a new non-cred-
it Arabic course. They will offer
classes for beginners and level-2
speakers (equivalent to GCSE).
Students completing the courses
will accrue six ECTS credits. The
course will cost £50 and are part
subsidised by Mr Naguib Kheraj,
the CEO of JP Morgan Cazenove.

involving 37 universities and al-
most 16,000 students.
NSS participation rises
The number of students complet-
ing the National Student Survey
at Imperial has increased by 7%
this year, marking the highest
participation ever at Imperial.
Overall 65% of students filled out
the survey, which is used as a
measure of student satisfaction
with their university. Following
poor NSS results in coursework
feedback last year, the Rec-
tor wrote to departments telling
them to make better coursework
feedback a top priority.
The Guardian has unveiled its
university league table for 2012,
placing Imperial 10th, down three
places from last year. Cambridge
have taken the top spot from Ox-
ford while Lancaster, Durham,
and Loughborough all place
ahead of Imperial. Though Impe-
rial scores poorly on several of
metrics, the table cites only 51%
of students being satisfied with
feedback for example, it comes
out top for career prospects, with
83% of students in a career after
six months.
Cut-price degrees?
In a recent interview with The Indepen-
dent, universities minister David Wil-
letts announced that universities would
be able to offer lower fees to students
who are applying through clearing in
order to fill their courses.
As if the idea of clearing isn’t daunting
enough for most university applicants,
the possibility of students from poorer
backgrounds holding off on university
places in order to gain a cheaper course
through clearing would definitely add to
the chaos and competitive desperation
to gain those coveted university places.
With an estimated two thirds of uni-
versities raising their tuition fees to
£9,000, the fear of reducing fees for
places through clearing is that able stu-
dents who are willing to take the risk of
applying through clearing may end up
not getting a place at all. Aaron Porter,
the president of National Union of Stu-
dents told The Independent that clearing
would turn into a “flea market” for stu-
dents trying to find the best deals.
It was also reported that universities
might offer other incentives such as
free iPads and Laptops to bribe students
into taking their courses. It is thought
that this plan would avoid the prospect
of students on the same course paying
different fees which is a major fault in
lowering fees in clearing.
The Office for Fair Access (Offa),
however, who are in charge of regulat-
ing university tuition fees, are not in
favour of lowering tuition fees during
clearing and have written to universities
requesting that they do not follow this
route.
In addition to this scheme, the gov-
ernment are still considering proposals
