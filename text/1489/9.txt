Clockwise from top:
– The original 1909 sketch for the Students’
Union building by architect Sir Aston Webb.
The building cost £15,000 at the time (nearly
£1.3 million in today’s money) and would be
completed in 1911.
– A photo of the Union building published in Fe-
lix in October 1954 as work began on adding an
extra two floors to the top, creating the Union
as we know it today. Work was completed in
1957 (although word has it that the discovery
of asbestos delayed the opening of Metric).
– The original floor plan of the Union building,
including a ‘Smoke Room’. Those were the
days...
– In the 1920s the West, South and East
wings of Beit were built, fully enclosing the
Quad. This original 1924 sketch by architect
Sir Aston Webb shows the north-west corner
of Beit Quad. This part of the four-storey ‘hos-
tel’ originally housed 50 students. The sign
for the ‘hostel’ can still be seen in the door-
way today.
