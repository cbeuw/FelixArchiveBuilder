On campus
Hedge Fund Incentives
Dr Jan Obloj, of the

have ambiguous risk
implications for hedge
fund managers. This is
a free drop-in seminar.

More than just cooking
Microwaves are most commonly associated
with cooking ready-made meals, or for the more
discerning, their use in mobile phones. Professor
Norbert Klein, however, will show in this lecture how
his research could provide new security applications
for microwaves in scanning equipment. Registration
in advance. Contact Kathleen Weeks – k.weeks@
imperial.ac.uk – for more information.

Nuclear Forensics
Nuclear proliferation is one of the biggest threats to
global security today and tracking nuclear materials,
as well as identifying their source, is a key part of the
battle. Dr Jay Davis has spent the last twenty years

Union Elections

of your students’ union, whether through improving the

alcollegeunion.org/vote. Nominations close on Monday

This guy could probably use some Relentless
Lolcat of teh week
Union Awards
If you want a rather more formal way of giving a deserving
friend a pat on the back and a beer in the bar, consider
nominating them for an Union award. The awards are
given to students who have contributed positively to life
at Imperial, either by making things generally better, or by
being a campus-wide recognised badass (ok, that last bit
isn’t necessarily going to get you an award). More infor-
mation and a nomination form can be found on the Union
website. Nominations close on Tuesday 24th at midnight.
