The Imperial Institute
W
hen construction began on
the grand Imperial Institute
in 1887, fears were already
being expressed that it would turn into
a wasteful white elephant. Barely a year
later, in fact, Thomas Henry Huxley
had already pronounced the monumen-
tal project ‘a failure’. But when Rector
Sir Patrick Linstead decided to tear the
building down over half a century later,
he was met with public outrage. At the
time, it was reported that the decision
to demolish the Institute was partly be-
cause its ‘architecture would be “diffi-
cult to reconcile” with the new science
buildings’.
Among those not swayed by this line
of reasoning was future Poet Laureate
John Betjeman, a vocal campaigner for
the preservation of iconic British archi-
tecture. Opposition to the plans grew as
The Times took up the cause to save the
Imperial Institute and its letters pages
were filled with denouncements of our
university’s expansion. One commenta-
tor writing in the Country Life magazine
suggested that the Royal College of Mu-
sic – in his opinion a fourth-rate building
– be sacrificed in the Institute’s place.
The sad future of the Victorian edi-
fice was almost an inevitability, as it
fell prey to financial trouble almost as
soon as construction finished. By 1899
it had been taken over by the govern-
ment, who promptly gave the University
of London half of the building for use
as administrative offices; they moved
out again in 1936. In some ways, the
Institute was the Millennium Dome of
its time; it contained a cinema, labora-
tories, teaching facilities, conference
facilities, and hosted exhibitions. But by
World War Two it had fallen from glory,
with the exhibition galleries ‘desolate
and deserted’ and various government
agencies haphazardly squatting there.
Plans for the Insitute’s demolition be-
came public knowledge in 1956. The
ensuing debate resulted in a compro-
mise leaving the Collcutt Tower, which
is known today as the Queen’s Tower,
would be retained. Not everyone was
best pleased by this, with an article in
The Engineer magazine declaring ‘there
is no logic about the retention of a use-
less tower’ and wished for it to be unsta-
ble: ‘There is but one hope left. It is that
upon examination the tower standing
nakedly alone will prove to be unstable.
We hope so! We profoundly hope so!’
The demolition began in 1957 with
the destruction of the rear galleries in
the east wing. In 1962 Imperial Institute
Road was closed to public traffic and
by 1965 all but the Queen’s Tower re-
mained.
One man, Brigadier Arthur Fortescue
of the Coldstream Guards, was so ap-
palled by the act of vandalism that he
dashed in and out of the demolition site
rescuing “bits of decorative stonework”,
as reported in the Evening Standard.
Work on the tower’s structural foun-
dations began on the 14th of March
1966. The tower was cleaned and a new
lower balcony was added. The project
was finally completed in 1969, along
with the ‘College Block’ development
which included the Central Library
building and the Great Hall.

Clockwise from top:
– The Imperial Institute, as seen from what
is now known as Imperial College Road (then
known as Imperial Institute Road).
– A cartoon printed in Felix on February 14th,
1958 (four months after the Sputnik I launch)
imagining the ‘Colcutt Tower’ as a Soviet
space rocket.
– A note from John K Taylor on July 15th 1958
to the current Rector, Dr Linstead, which ac-
companied a photo of the East tower being
demolished.
– The Queen’s Lawn area, much as it is today,
on completion in 1969.
– The West tower of the Imperial Institute dur-
ing the demolition, as seen from the Queen’s
Tower. Note the old Aeronautical museum
behind it, where the Central Library is now
situated.
– Only the Queen’s Tower remains of the origi-
nal building. A significant amount of structural
engineering was needed to ensure that the
tower could stand alone as the final bits of
the Institute were pulled away from it.
