Procrastination has only served man
kind: The pizza burger, Kite Surf-
ing, Skittle Vodka and now the Pis-
tolShrimps! An invitational rugby 7s
team formed by Alex Johnstone and
Joe Brown whilst trying to revise for
their finals…The idea was that the team
would be made up of the best players to
have passed through Imperial over the
past 5 years and a couple of ringers. The
intention of the team was to be competi-
tive at the big national tournaments and
have a good time doing it.
The name ‘The PistolShrimps’ origi-
nated from a Hydrostatics and Shocks
lecture where the lecturer claimed that
these little shrimps with massive claws
accelerated water out of their claws to
stun and kill their prey. Supposedly in
the process creating cavitation and sono-
luminescence… On to Middlesex...Hav-
ing won the Middlesex student 7s four
years on the trot it was deemed essential
to enter the Mens Open and win that as
well. A few white lies enabled the team
to be entered under the title of ‘Imperial
College Old Boys’. The first two group
games proved an excellent start of the
season, tough physical games against
the Esher Academy and Hammersmith
& Fulham 1s saw the Shrimps smash
both opposition convincingly. The team
was playing some excellent sevens and it
was a shame the last group game and the
quarters were against lesser opposition
that encouraged bad habits. The semi
against the eventual winners Ruislip was
a hard fought and very physical affair.
Unfortunately the shrimps lost their two
most experienced players to injury early
doors. Ruislip scored twice before we
responded. At 10-7 the game was ours to
win, but poor handling ruined a two man
overlap which Ruislip capitalised on to
run in another try and put the game out
of our reach.
Ollie Cox (Who incidentally
was asked on the day if he want-
ed to be an Abercrombie model…
#hangingoutthebackoftara) was award-
ed Shrimp of the tournament for his
Imperial ARCS return for a second year
On Friday the 10th of June, Sport Impe-
rial will host its second annual awards
and celebration event championing the
contribution that sports make to the uni-
versity life of students of Imperial Col-
lege.
There are a number of award catego-
ries for which people can be nominated
for; the event looks to reward those
who have made a sporting contribu-
tion for Imperial College and yet have
remained under the radar and perhaps
have not received the recognition that
they deserve.
One of the most coveted prizes, the
Ethos Award, is awarded to an indi-
vidual or group who are deemed to have
contributed positively to the fitness cen-
ter based in South Kensington.
The evening’s events will also include
a sports showcase, drinks reception and
light buffet.
For more information on the award
categories visit the Sport Imperial Web-
site; today is the last day to nominate
personnel for the various awards whilst
information on the award categories
may also be found on the Sport Imperial
Website.
For further information on the event
you may contact Hannah Blandford via
email at h.blandford@imperial.ac.uk.

Facebook and Twitter to keep ahead of
the game when it comes to forthcoming
sports news and events regarding Impe-
rial College.
Shrimps aim to become
big fish in the pond
superb ability to make space and half
breaks throughout the day. Whilst we
did not win the tournament the baby
blue coral background and massive pink
shrimp across both the shirt and shorts
made us a crowd favourite.
Many of the teams that participate in
the National Sevens Series started this
way; groups of friends ambitious to play
good sevens and have fun. The Shrimps
are trying to build a recognisable brand
that can be enjoyed by both players and
supporters. Join us at RugbyRocks at
Richmond RFC on the 4th of June or
alternatively The Church Sevens on the
18th of June. #Shrimpinlikeitshot.
