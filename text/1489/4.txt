Help us make your Union better!
Come along, just for a few minutes, and help us set our agenda for the next five years! We have some questions
that we need you to answer so we can be sure we are making your time at Imperial the best it can be.
Do you know someone who has done
an outstanding job as a representative?
A club or society member? someone
involved in welfare support? or a really
good events organiser? The Union awards
outstanding individuals each year; any
student can nominate someone and
we are accepting nominations from
now until May 24. There are thousands
of volunteers working in all parts of
the Union from clubs and societies to
representation and we believe those
who have gone over and above what is
expected of them should be recognised.
The awards are:
• Union Colour
• Outstanding Service Award
• Imperial College Union Fellowship
with Distinction
For someone to win an award they have
to be nominated by any Full member of
the Union (any student at Imperial) and
then the Colours Committee considers
the nominations. Nominations will close
on 24 May so make sure you get yours in
early!
To nominate someone
for an award, you need
to fill in the form
available online.
