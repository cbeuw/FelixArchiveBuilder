What no Twatter
again!?
Yeah so we tricked you with the font, and the bird. It
turns out exams need revision to pass, who knew. I
just wish I was coming here next year (see the Turnip).

Ex
ams to be replaced by lottery
A
recent survey to determine the main
gripes of students showed that exami-
nations and coursework topped the list.
Many of the students who completed the sur-
vey said exams were an “unfair system harm-
ing those who can’t be fucked to learn shit”.
Now that Imperial College will be charging
up to £9,000 per year for tuition fees, Deputy
President (Welfare) Charlotte Ivison used this
opportune time to negotiate what many Wel-
fare Officers have hitherto failed to: the aboli-
tion of exams. Any readers who are currently
revising should continue doing so; the new
rules only come into effect from the 2011/2012
academic year onwards. Fast-tracking them in
time for this summer was on the table until the
President, Alex Kendall, withdrew his “blank
cheque” offer of sexual favours to the Rector
at the last minute. Because of that moment of
virginal anxiety Imperialites will have to en-
dure one more summer ruined by exams, just
in case the rain doesn’t get to it first. It should
be pointed out that both the Rector and Kend-
all deny that such an arrangement was ever on
the table, or indeed under it, but recordings ob-
tained by The Turnip show repeated mentions
of “whatever makes you comfortable”, “I’m
willing to bend over backwards, literally”, and
“I’m willing to take a shafting on this one”.
One source said the Rector rejected the offer
as he “likes big butts, and simply can not lie”.
The transition to no exams will be a two-
phase process: by Christmas of next year stu-
dents will be given the option of entering a
raffle to determine their grade, if they choose
not to sit the exam. The raffle will consist of
tickets with a percentage grade written on
them; if too many students achieve high grades
the marks will be scaled down accordingly and
vice versa. The following year the ticket pool
will be adjusted to prevent a re-occurrence.
These changes will come just in time for the
humanities exams at the end of the first term,
which will come as a huge relief to the large
number of students who do them because
they’re an easy option and hate having to put
any effort in. By the summer of 2012 they will
be abolished entirely, so even the masochistic
diehards who would still take the exams will
be left with no choice but to adapt to the new
system.
Preliminary speculation suggests that any
extra free computers available in the third
term because of this move will be short-lived:
pasty World of Warcraft enthusiasts are likely
to seize upon this to set up multiple 24-hour
LAN parties in a Central Library devoid of
unreasonable requests of students wanting to
print off exam papers, not only to level up their
Paladins but to escape the harsh sun of the
English summer. Some are concerned that they
will take up permanent residence.
Alcohol: Wow, hey man, long time no speak.
What’s up with that?
You: Yeah sorry I have exams, I may actually
only hang out with you for a bit
Alcohol: What? Come on man lets do a big
one. You’ll be fine tomorrow morning I swear.
You can get up early and work
You: Okay, fine.
Later in the club:
Guys:
You: I can’t dance I’m too shy.
Alcohol: Yeah you can. Just flail your arms
about vaguely. Wow, man you look just like
Usher. Wait, look at her.
You: Where? What her? Meh, she’s like a 5.
Alcohol: Are you CRAZY? She is a totally le-
git 8. Here, look through my glasses.
You: WOW she is hot, definitely an 8.
Alcohol: Maybe even a 9 if you hang out with
me a bit longer. Go over and talk to her.
You: What should I say?
Alcohol: Just stumble over to her, make sug-
gestive hand motions. Try to slur your words.
Works ever time trust me.
You: Sounds like a plan.
Girls:
You: Look at this idiot. He’s so repulsive.
Alcohol: Are you talking about that George
Clooney dead ringer over there? It would be
the height of stupidity to not go home with him
right now.
You: You’re right alcohol. You always know
what’s best for me.
Back home:
You: Can’t believe I got rejected, I’m so horny.
Alcohol: I thought throwing up on her shoes
would make you look like a bad-ass mother-
fucker. Meh, call up your ex. I bet she wants it.
You: Fuck yeah she does! But what do I say?
Alcohol: Say hey and that you’re just calling
to see how she is. Then you need to switch
it up and get graphic. Make sure she under-
stands exactly how horny you are. Then, you
need to start crying and say you miss her.
Shows your sensitive side, bitches love it. If
you say you’re soul mates she can’t NOT give
you a blowey.
You: No answer, I’ll just leave a voicemail.
Alcohol: You need a backup option. You
should text every girl you saw tonight.
You: Alcohol, you are just full of amazing
flawless ideas. Done. I feel sick.
Next morning:
You: I feel terrible, I thought you said I would
be fine alcohol. Alcohol? Where the fuck is
alcohol?
Sobriety: Hey dickhead. He’s gone; I’ll be
here with you all day. You got a text from your
ex. She says delete her number and never talk
to her again.
You: Have you seen dignity?
Sobriety: He left; I don’t think he’s coming
back.
A night out with your old pal alcohol...
What should we do tonight, Alcohol?
The same thing we do every night, Guy
With Highlights: drown in self-pity

Homoerotic Rap Lyrics
Clearly Giggs is a graduate from the
Michael Jackson School of intimida-
tion. I am also confused about why
Giggs is so passionate about trans-
port advertising.
“Bring it to the battlefield, I’ll touch
his mate.”
Giggs – Bus commercial
Let’s just hope this is a poorly timed
grunt and ad-lib. I think the fact that
this is on a song called “Fucking You
Tonight” makes it worse.
“Biggie: Ugh
Diddy: I like that, you like that?”
Okay, well good luck with that.
Getting money – check. Turning my
men on – in progress.
“I been paid, I’m just trying to turn
my mans on.”
Slim Thug – I Run
The Notorious B.I.G and Diddy –
Fucking You Tonight
So you want the rapper to be tight
and hard do you? Not to mention it
would make an extremely poor tooth-
brush. Oh and, if you have had to
write two songs proclaiming your in-
nocence, it is very likely to actually
be your fault.
“I’ll make your tightest hardest rap-
per brush his teeth with my dick.”
Mystikal – It Ain’t My Fault 2
So your city is in Thailand then I
guess. A bit of advice for you Killer
Mike, this is the sort of thing you only
admit when drunk.
“Gotta bomb red bitch that I call
al-Qaeda. She got some bomb-ass
head, and a bomb-ass cock.”
Killer Mike – In My City
The Union said suggesting the chang-
es would lead to a drop in standards
is much like this picture: hyperbolic
