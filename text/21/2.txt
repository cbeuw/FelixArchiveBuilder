HOPPING HAD
Sir - Phe following i s a copy of a l e t t e r which we
have sent to the Hon. Sec. I.C. Entertainments Ctte.
The Hon. S e c . ,
I.C. Entertainments Committee.
Dear S i r ,
We would, l i k e to draw your serious attention to
the matter of I.C. hops, as we f e e l that t h e i r pop-
u l a r i t y would j u s t i f y t h i s f u r t h e r attempt at a s o l -
ution.
It would a'ppear that by the s a t i s f a c t o r y exclu-
sion of gate-crashers and any other undesired guests,
the present problem could be solved, and we believe
that the type of 'atmosphere' desired at our hops
could be ensured i n the following manner:-
Tickets should be on sale i n advance only, i n
the bar and by the Entertainments Secretaries i n the
relevant women's colleges.
These t i c k e t s would not be dated - and would
therefore by available f o r any Saturday - but would
be date-stamped at the door, thus preventing t h e i r
further use.
t h i s would have the e f f e c t of enabling us to
choose both our guests and t h e i r numbers.
Such a system has been i n use elsewhere i n the
University and should work to the s a t i s f a c t i o n of
a l l ; the r e l a t i v e l y small inconvenience caused
would be amply compensated by the r e s u l t s .
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
T.J.Gilbert, H.W.Phillips,
D.Y.Parker, C i t y and Guilds.

TO FELIX
To speak of thy glory i s vain. 'Tis known
Thou'rt covered a l l over with i t .
Thy temples of i n t e l l e c t reign; you've shown
A wonderful, b r i l l i a n t wit,
And l a t e l y you've greatly your brow raised so f a r .
The Culture wave started by brave D.G.R.
Has drowned us i n Manet and Schubert and Joyce,
While none of your readers dare r a i s e a small voice
In favour of Lutcher and Doss. Don't mock
The Culture - i t ' s here to stay.
You're not now A Minor. Your key.. Unlock
The Yale. Let's drink to YOUR DAY!
We regret that we have been unable t o include
reports on the Hydro-Power Easter Tour, the
Mountaineering Club Dinner, Rugger Tout and
the Whiteley Cup (squash). - Ed.
INTERNATIONAL GROUP
S i r - I would l i k e t o bring to your attention the
recent formation of a group within the I.C. P o l i -
t i c a l Society, devoted to the study of i n t e r n a t i o n -
al a f f a i r s .
It i s a Batter c a l l i n g f o r some comment, that
in a college the size of ours, there appears to be
complete indifference to the serious problems fac-
ing the governments of the world.
The responsible p o s i t i o n held by the scient-
i s t i n modern society makes i t most important that
he should understand the issues at stake. Other-
wise his opinions are l i k e l y to be influenced by
almost any dubious propaganda.
It i s with the object of f o s t e r i n g a serious
i n t e r e s t i n , and study of, international, p o l i t i c a l ,
s o c i a l and. economic questions, that the Internat-
i o n a l Group has been formed. I hope that i t w i l l
be able to look forward to the keen support of
I.C.U. members i n the future.
I am, Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,

POTTED POEM
Dear S i r ,
No pots Have they who write the news,
Bur guides with e d i t o r i a l views:
P l a i n glass for FELIX, PHOENIX too.
What w i l l I . e . Union do?
P o t i f a r
(I.C.U. - or do I?)
THE QUAD.
Sir - The tennis courts surrounded by rusty i r o n
n e t t i n g constitute a hideous eyesore, inconsistent
with the charm and d i g n i t y of the college. This
conglomeration of i r o n and gravel i s scarcely con-
ducive to the atmosphere necessary f o r the proper
appreciation of the Arts.
Is i t j u s t that the p r i v i l e g e d few should en-
joy t h e i r tennis to the negation of the best i n t e r -
ests of the college as a whole? And f i n a l l y , to
see fourteen s c a n t i l y - c l a d females engaged i n the
v i c i o u s sport of n e t b a l l i s the bottom.
I suggest therefore that the tennis courts are
torn up and a Bowling Green (Crown green preferred)
be l a i d i n t h e i r place. The aesthetic value of
such a green f a r outweighs the s l i g h t inconvenience
caused by what are, a f t e r a l l , only minor sectional
i n t e r e s t s . The colour seheme can be enhanced by
herbacious borders or hardy perennials ( i . e . flowers)
ranging from d a f f o d i l s i n the spring to chrysanthe-
mums i n the autumn.
I commend these suggestions f o r the serious con-
s i d e r a t i o n of the a u t h o r i t i e s concerned.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y , Frank Drake.
