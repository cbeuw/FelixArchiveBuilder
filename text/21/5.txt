Y NIGHT HOPS
I t seems t h a t the f a t e o f our Saturday Night
Hops hangs v e r y p r e c a r i o u s l y i n the b a l a n c e . To me,
at, any r a t e , t h i s i s indeed a sad s t a t e of a f f a i r s
and one * h i c h I f e e l sure i s g o i n g to cause some
heated d i s c u s s i o n i n the v e r y near f u t u r e . I t w i l l
not be i n a p p r o p r i a t e , t h e r e f o r e , to g i v e a b r i e f
h i s t o r y of the Hops f o r the b e n e f i t of newcomers to
I.C.
There are s t i l l a few amongst us who remember
how i t a l l began. I n f o r m a l Dances, to g i v e them
t h e i r p r o p e r name, were i n t r o d u c e d i n the Autumn of
1946 and f e r e i n t e n d e d mainly f o r H o s t e l r e s i d e n t s ,
whose l a c k of energy ( o r was i t cash?) debarred them
from the many Saturday Night a t t r a c t i o n s away from
the Union. The f i r s t problem which f a c e d the organ-
i s e r s was the p r o v i s i o n of p a r t n e r s , the H o s t e l and
indeed the Union,being q u i t e i n c a p a b l e of s e l f -
s u p p o r t . There b e i n g no Q.A. at t h a t time, a remedy
was sought by i s s u i n g s t a n d i n g i n v i t a t i o n s to women
s t u d e n t s of o t h e r C o l l e g e s . The e a r l y Hops had to
pay f o r themselves and gramophone records were
u r g e n t l y ' n e e d e d , so the c a l l went out to the r e s t of
the Union to support t h i s new I.C. v e n t u r e .
In those days, the I.u.U. E n t e r t a i n m e n t s
Gommitteejas we know i t now,did n o t e x i s t . The
o r g a n i s e r s r e l i e d on the h e l p of any members of the
Union who c o u l d be c a j o l e d o r b r i b e d i n t o g i v i n g a
hand and they themselves put i n many hours o f hard
work, moving f u r n i t u r e , sweeping f l o o r s , e t c .
G r a d u a l l y the hard work and enthusiasm of these
p i o n e e r s began to b r i n g i t s reward - the Hops were
e s t a b l i s h e d , touring the next two o r three y e a r s , a
g r e a t e f f o r t was made to improve the Hops, to p r o v i d e
the b e s t bob's worth p o s s i b l e . As the t a k i n g s grew
the s t o c k of gramophone r e c o r d s was i n c r e a s e d and
" s i f t e d " u n t i l our c o l l e c t i o n became the envy of
many. Much was done to make the t a s k of the organ-
i s e r s e a s i e r . By t h i s time the I.C.U. E n t e r t a i n m e n t s
Committee had come i n t o b e i n g w i t h a c o n s t i t u t i o n and
s t a t u s worthy of the t a s k s which i t was c a l l e d upon
to p e r f o r m .
What of the present p o s i t i o n ? Up to t h i s y e a r
i t has been our proud b o a s t t h a t the Hops never stop
- they continue r i g h t to the end of the S e s s i o n .
But t h i s y e a r , the E n t e r t a i n m e n t s Committee had the
a u d a c i t y to suggest t h a t no Hops be h e l d i n the Summer
Term! Why does the E n t e r t a i n m e n t s Committee wish to
d i s c o n t i n u e the Hops? Perhaps they have had enough
by now. A f t e r almost three years of o r g a n i s i n g Hops
I can sympathise w i t h them - but we never l e t the
Union down b e f o r e .
On the o t h e r hand, t h e r e have been c o m p l a i n t s
about the Hops and s e v e r a l have found t h e i r way i n t o
F e l i x . Again, t h i s i s not u n u s u a l . There have been
c r i t i c i s m s of the Hops e v e r s i n c e they s t a r t e d . I t
i s the o l d , o l d s t o r y - people are always ready to
complain or c r i t i c i s e , but v e r y few f i n d time to w r i t e
l e t t e r s of p r a i s e o r o f f e r i n g u s e f u l s u g g e s t i o n s .
Hc-ever, i n s p i t e of the c r i t i c s , I s t i l l m a i n t a i n as
I have done f o r s e v e r a l years that w h i l e 400 people
continue to a t t e n d the Hops each Saturday, they must
be p o p u l a r .
In f a i r n e s s to the c r i t i c s , I must admit t h a t
members of the Union do l i t t l e to encourage o r h e l p
the hardworking E n t e r t a i n m e n t s Committee. There are
f a r too many who are ready to i n t r o d u c e a " p e r s o n a l
g u e s t " . I f a t i c k e t system was i n t r o d u c e d , t h e r e
would s t i l l be the smart boys who would walk s t r a i g h t
i n w i t h o u t a t i c k e t . A l i t t l e more e f f o r t on our
p a r t would do f a r more to improve the c o n d i t i o n s at
the Hops than any a c t i o n by C o u n c i l .
Summing up, I would say that the E n t e r t a i n m e n t s
Committee were not j u s t i f i e d i n a s k i n g t h a t the Hops
be d i s c o n t i n u e d . Nor i n my o p i n i o n was C o u n c i l wise
to implement t h a t d e c i s i o n . This i s a m a t t e r which
i s of g r e a t i n t e r e s t to a l a r g e s e c t i o n of the Union
and I f e e l t h a t o n l y a r e s o l u t i o n passed by a Union
meetinf s h o u l d be able to b r i n g to an end a f u n c t i o n
which i s now accepted as a r e g u l a r f e a t u r e of our
College l i f e . R, am.
