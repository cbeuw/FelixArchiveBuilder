MATTERS OF PRINCIPLE
At the l a s t I.C. Council meeting two very
controversial issues were brought up f o r discuss-
ion and important decisions of far-reaching con-
â€¢equenoe were taken, without an attempt W i n g made
ftrflt to sound the opinion of members of the Union.
While i t i s true that Council i s responsible for
the day to day running of t he Union, i t i s with
Krave oonoern that one views their recent action
a f f e c t i n g as i t does the fundamental privileges
of every member of the Union.
It oan be, and has been argued that the two
is sues d i f f e r widely i n p r i n c i p l e and that whereas
the question of the continuance or otherwise of
the Hops i s one on which Council should take the
lead, that concerning the extension of certain
Union f a c i l i t i e s to members of other oolleges i s
a matter on which the Union members should be con-
sulted. While there i s something tote said for
t h i s view,one must be careful to ascertain that
these supporting i t do not do so because they are
in favour of one decision and against the otherl
It has been wisely decided to put an end to
the countless private argmments and have both these
topics disoussed f r e e l y at a Union meeting. Let
the quiet drinkers, noisy dancers, intercollegiates
and i s o l a t i o n i s t s come forward and a i r their opin-
ions.
TICKET OR LEAVE IT
So f a r i n the minutes of the Refectory Commit-
tee we have f a i l e d to f i n d any proposal to restore
the s o c i a l intercourse that was a part of the old
tioket system - the game of hunt-the-supper-ticket,
as played from 6.20 to 6.50 ewery evening (except
Sundays).
How many of our closest acquaintances were not,
in fact, introduced f i r s t f o r such enquiries, and
how often have we not stood at the door with this
excuse f o r conversation on our l i p s and with one of
the 376 (?) possible permutations of 2/3d getting
hot i n our hands, searching for a lady of I.C.W.A.,
unaccompanied and as yet unmet?
Teetotallers, Presidents, freshers and brown-
baggers were thus mixed and fed into the sooial
stew. Now a l i t t l e thorn hath arisen within our
Gardner, and worst of atll, i n Sxirinei

The Dramatic Society were paid the compli-
ment of a critique of their Easter production
in the Times Educational Supplement (April 6th).
Whilst not agreeing with the Times writer that
the choice of Auden & Isherwood's s a t i r i c a l drama
of t h e ' t h i r t i e s was "wise", one must admit that
i t came o f f better than expected; the machina-
tions of the p o l i t i c i a n s and patriots of that
period were e f f e c t i v e l y exposed and their mot-
ives interpreted. Though, the f i n a l moral near
the end of the play was obscured from the present
writer - i n fact, had the conqueror of F.6. "succ-
eeded" or "failed"?
The lead, that of Michael Ransom, played by
Christopher McKoen, was a remarkable feat of mem-
ory and endurance. Ransom emerged as a s o l i d
and credible character - i f , perhaps, Just a l i t -
tle too extrovert.
Of the other parts, G i l l i a n Stern was magni-
f i c e n t as Lady Isobel Welwyn; the Times writer
says: "A memorably preposterous Lady Isobel".
Dagid Greenfield presented a convincing wastrel
as David Gunn and Jean Osborne was praiseworthy
as the Mother. John Harding and Brynnie G r i f f i n
gave a nicely restrained performance as Mr. and
Mrs. A.
The. Times Educational Supplement's f i n a l
words must have been g r a t i f y i n g to the players
and the producer (Shirley Meet): "But each charac-
ter was firmly seized and given that i n t e l l e c t u a l
l i f e whioh i t i s the student actor's special power
to conjure up"!
