At a rather e a r l y and unnatural hour on Thurs-
day, March 15th a party of s i i t e e n representatives
of I.C.H.C. l e f t f o r a ten days' tour of Dutch u n i -
v e r s i t i e s .
The f i r s t weekend was spent i n Rotterdam f i r s t
as the guests of the Hermes Society and then of the
V i c t o r i a Club. The state of the ground before the
•atch against Hermes (won 5-0) caused some concern
but the carefree abandon with which our opponents
played soon made t h i s a matter of secondary consid-
eration. Justesen was almost caught o f f guard by
the customary cheers taking place before the maatch,
but recovered i n time to respond (though no-one
quite heard who i t was we were cheering).
The game against the V i c t o r i a Club was cancel-
led due to bad weather. They arranged a t r i p to
the Hockey I n t e r n a t i o n a l , Holland v. Belgium, at
Amsterdam, and entertained us l a v i s h l y at night
clubs i n c l u d i n g a chaotic evening i n Chinatown.
On Monday, March 19th, the party entrained f o r
Utrecht where, i n the afternoon, a somewhat bleary-
eyed team l o s t 3-1 against Utrecht students a f t e r
a hard f i g h t . I t was noticeable that one or two
unnamed players were having more than considerable
d i f f i c u l t y i n seeing the r i g h t b a l l . However t h i s
defeat was l a t e r avenged at table-tennis when the
Utrecht champions were eclipsed at both singles and
doubles.
On the Wednesday the party l e f t f o r Groningen
when an overwhelming v i c t o r y 9-0 was scored over
the students. Bennett,previously unheard of as a
forward gave a s c i n t i l l a t i n g performance i n h i s new
r o l e , scoring seven goals. In the evening we were
a l l entertained at an o f f i c i a l dinner i n the Stud-
ents' Union. Many speeches were made on both sides,
songs were sung und a most c o n v i v i a l evening was
spent. F i n a l l y the paper t a b l e c l o t h s were ceremon-
i o u s l y burht much to the chagrin of the waiters.
Later that night McCall gave a demonstrationnof bat-
t l e d r i l l i n the town square, aided and abetted by
some Dutch Army veterans.
At a mixed hockey tournament i n the Hague, a
loudspeaker ajppeal brought young, ladies Blocking to
our banner, and they proved a considerable source of
i n s p i r a t i o n .
The impecunious party returned with many happy
memories of a most successful tour and look forward
to entertaining our Dutch friends on a s i m i l a r scale
when they pay us a return v i s i t i n the not too d i s -
tant future. ^_m ______________

To quote TUB TIMES,"An outstanding feature
of the race was the high performance by Cambridge
Oolleges, who f i l l e d eight pf the f i r s t twelve
places". In assessing the performance of the
I.C.B.C. one must, I f e e l , bear this i n mind, as
the 1st, Eight was a considerably better and
faster crew than last year. Nevertheless, the
unpalatable result remains; they finished 29th.
and did not row as well as they might have done.
As at Heading, a "rush" developed, but this time
the orew never settled down into a stride whioh
ia so essential i n a long race of ii miles. Due
to the rush, they were unable to take f u l l
advantage of the tail-wind from Ohiswiok Steps
to Hammersmith and had l i t t l e i n hand to drive
their boat into the head-wind below Harrods.
This probably cost them some ten seconds or so,
whioh would have made a difference of some ten
or more places. In spite of t h i s performance
however, there are the makings of a good crew i n
tl»e present 1st. Eight and with a l i t t l e rearrange
-ment they w i l l undoubtedly give a very good
aooount of themselves i n the regattas this term.
The greatest d i s t i n c t i o n oonferred on the
Club occurred after the race, when the Oaptain,
"Micky" North, and the ooaoh, Charles Bristow
had the honour of being presented to H.H.H. the
Princess Elizabeth at the Thames Rowing Club.

R.O.S. won the Technology uup f o r the
second year i n succession when they defeated R.S.M.
by two goals to n i l i n the f i n a l which was played
at aarlington on Wednesday March 14th before a
crowd of some f i v e persons.
In the f i r s t h a l f R.O.S. nearly scored
twice, once when a Miner who s h a l l be nameless
headed the b a l l against a post, and l a t e r when the
Mines 'keeper completely misjudged a speculative
punt by Taylor from the half-way l i n e .
After the i n t e r v a l the Miners kept R.u.S.
at bay u n t i l , In the 14th minute, just when the
R.u.S. defence was finding l i f e very d i f f i c u l t ,
there was a mix-up i n the Mines defence and the
b a l l wriggled i t s way into the net from Watson.
Uollinson t r i e d desperately to r a l l y his men but
i n the 35th minute Browne, who had a good match,
centred and a Mines defender handled. Buckroyd
shot the r e s u l t i n g penalty straight at the goal-
keeper who found i t too hot to hold and Jaokman
following up, scored. Thus ended the match and
a l l that remained was f o r Dr. Stevens to present
the oup to David Thompson.

The f i r s t match of the season, against Walton
A.C., was held on Tuesday 17th A p r i l . At the
meeting Mr. Roger Bannister (0.U.A-.C.) broke the
B r i t i s h Native record f o r the J mile i n a time of
2 mln. 56.8 sec. and was very close to the fastest
time ever recorded f o r t h i s distance. On the traftk
I.C. faced s t i f f opposition and f a i l e d to get the
better of their opponents, but i n the f i e l d events
they fared better, Brookman winning the Shot, Discus
and Javelin, and Bean came second i n the Shot,and
Discus. These successes were however i n s u f f i c i e n t
to save the day and I.C. lost by a narrow margin.
It was a Jleasing sight to see some I i C supporters
at the match, and we hope that this w i l l continue,
even when record-breaking by Bannister i s not an
additional attraction.

R.S.M. 6 - Camborne S.M. 3
On Friday March 16th the annual match be-
tween the Mines and Camborne S.M. was played at
Harlington. Mines won the toss and kioked o f f
against the wind. In the f i r s t half the play
was f a i r l y even and when half-time came the score
stood at 3-3, Mines gaving scored a penalty goal
kioked by B i l l Bobinson and Camborne a t r y .
The second half was marked by hard fought
line-outs, close marking, and a wonderful t r y
by Barry. Intercepting a pass he went inside
one opponent and outside his opposite number,
following this up by a run of 70 yards, he went
over i n the corner. For the rest of the game
Camborne pressed hard but the resultite Miners
kept them uout and thus regained the 'bottle'.

i . e . u.c.
When I.C. began batting on Saturday, under
gloomy skies i n a north wind, Harlington resembled
more a tundra than a cricket ground; and the f i r s t
desultory hour (40 runs f o r 3 wickets) seemed to
confirm that i t was too cold f o r bowlers and too
early i n the season f o r batsmen.
Then Dave Waterland, after some preliminary
sparring about, settled down to deliver himself of
a l i v e l y 51. Other useful contributors, including
29 by Geoff Bennett, helped the score to 140 f o r 6
dec. which i s a respectable t o t a l f o r two hours'
batting on such a day.
U.C. got to 103-5 (Kemp 63 not out} before
stumps were drawn and never appeared i n serious
danger of defeat. I.C.'s bowling and f i e l d i n g
were considerably less impressive than the batting,
but w i l l no doubt improve when the sun shines again.
Meantime the season has opened without f a i n , snow
or disaster, which has not always been so i n the
past.
