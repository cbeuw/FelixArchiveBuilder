T.B. APPEAL
It has "been decided, to hold the collection f o r the T.B.
Appeal Fund (mentioned in an earlier edition of FELIX) on
Thursday May. 10th0
It i s hoped tc carry the collection tc a l l departments of
the College, including members of s t a f f 0 For this purpose we
shall require the assistance of about 20 students i n each of
R.C.S. and C & a. and 10 students i n R.S.M.
Flease show your generosity when the collection i s taken
and give at least 2/6d so that we may break the target of
.£200 and, i f possible, collect considerably more than this
amount, ^atch the notice-boards f o r further information.
Anyone wishing to assist with the collection please l e t
me know,
Derek Y.Coomber, President I.C.II.
MINES CARNIVAL
FELIX thought i t advisable to employ two obser-
vers to report the Mines Carnival: f o r i t was f o r e -
seen that one was most u n l i k e l y to last the evening
unaided. From time to time, therefore, these obs-
e r v e r s f e l t obliged to leave t h e i r own party and
to wander upstairs, where they found themselves
uhpaid extras i n what might well have been a scene
from Treasure Island. *

Buccaneer^' Barbecue was undoubtedly the most
resplendently decorated c a r n i v a l of recent years,
and bore every i n d i c a t i o n of the recent campaign
waged by the phantasmogenitor of each college i n
turn to oudo each other's work. We f e e l that t h i s
tendency must i n e v i t a b l y soon cease, before the
Union b u i l d i n g i t s e l f i s destroyed f o r the sake' of
the Carnival. (Continued on p. 3)

al trace I . e . was f i r s t e q u a l w i t h U.C. and C h e l s e a
P o l y . 3rd w i t h two p o i n t s l e s s . Thus to v/in the
cup I.C. had t o b e a t U.C., b u t c o u l d a f f o r d to come
i n one p o s i t i o n b e h i n d C h e l s e a P o l y .

Thus owing t o U.C.'s sudden d e p a r t u r e from the
r a c e and C h e l s e a 's g a i n i n g an advantage of o n l y one
point, I.C- won t h e cup by the narrow m a r g i n of one
p o i n t .
BOXING
On March 16th I.C. once again proved t h e i r box-
ing s u p e r i o r i t y when they won the U.L. Cup by a very
comfortable margin:,
I.C 29 points
Goldsmiths' 16 points
King's 13 points
Gordon T a i t and Johnny Martin both* obtained walk-
overs i n the f i n a l s of the Flyweight and Bantamweight
d i v i s i o n s respectively. We must thank them f o r being
present at the weigh-in and our P u b l i c i t y Agent & r
frightening away a l l l i k e l y opposition i n these weights.
The referee prevented Mike Humphries from dealing
out any more punishment t o M. Sargent (Goldsmiths')
when he stopped the Featherweight f i n a l i n the s econd
round. In the well-matched Lightweight f i n a l B i l l
Gardner used his l e f t hand togrod effect t o keep J.
Reavey (King's) at long range, but l a s t narrowly on
points.
We saw the most i n t e r e s t i n g f i g h t of the evening
when Stan Coppelman went out to meet A. Dujon (King's)
in the Welterweight f i n a l . Stan made many valiant
attempts to get at close quarters wirth his very exper-
ienced opponent but Dujon had most of the answers to
Stan's stoming attacks and gained a points decision.
It was a great tonic f o r I.C. spectators to see
the most businesslike way i n which Hugh Huckin set
about D. Jessett (King's) i n the Middleweight f i n a l
to put him on the canvas f o r counts of seven, eight
and f i n a l l y ten. The most unfortunate incident i n
a wonderful evening f o r I.C. was i n the Light Heavy-
weight f i n a l when PierseEbswoi+h sustained a rather
nasty cut over his eye from the inside of his opp-
onent' s glove. Piers was well ahead of G.Wootton
(Goldsmiths') on points when the referee stopped the
f i g h t i n the second round.
A f t e r the boxing Terry ( " K i l l e r " ) Hulme, the I.C.
Captain was presented with the " B l o t t " Cup and Gordon
S a l t , Johnny Martin, Mike Humphries and Hugh Huckin
each received a U.L.A.U. medal.
Later i n the evening a number of inebriated box-
ers were to be seen enjoying themselves at the Mines
Carnival much to the BPnoyance of c e r t a i n gentlemen
who frequently l o s t t h e i r partners f o r short periods
of time.
We should l i k e to congratulate Mike Humphries
and Gordon T a i t on having been chosen to box f o r U.L.
against Paris University on May 15th.
