PROFILE- "PJH:
The sketch above i s n ' t r e a l l y very l i k e Haskell.
But regarded diagrammatically i t indicates the contor-
ted " l i n i n e s s " of the H a s k e l l i a n countenance. I t has
an epstlnlan ruggedness that the kindly disposed would
ascribe to unremitting t o i l . The honest fellow i s
more l i k e l y t o read i n t o these l i n e s a youth, now long
past, of unremitted d i s s i p a t i o n , and a few minutes'
discourse with Pete himself w i l l unshakeably confirm
him i n t h i s view. Tes, l e t ' s not hedge - the Presid-
ent of R.C.S. i s rather a rogue.
Haskell i s well down the slope to the sere and
yellow. F i n i s h i n g h i s fourth year i n the Arts ( i . e .
b i o l o g i c a l ) Faculty of I.C. , where his p a r t i c u l a r
lack of d i s c i p l i n e i s Entomology, he must be one of
the few undergraduate r e l i c s of that wartime genera-
t i o n who came up i n the prime of t h e i r middle twenties.
He hadn't then become so completely an evangel f o r Cul-
ture, and was wont t o unload h i s sujjVus ergs v i a an
oar i n the I.C. 3rd eight. The decrepitude of pass-
ing years and the time-consuming demands of hot-gospel-
l i n g f o r the L i b e r a l Ideal have of late confined Pete'*
rowing t o the towpath or even f u r t h e r inland. The
fact that the boat club demands a subscription perhaps
hastened the athle-tle decline.
Pete's late a r r i v a l on the I.C. campus was con-
sequent upon h i s being requested t o serve h i s Majesty's
pleasure. Avoiding the army, he helped postpone the
day of v i c t o r y some years by serving i n the Royal Show-
er (of S i g n a l s ) . In t h i s connection, as h i s main
claim to fame, Pete i n s i s t s that he was the only bloke
to serve i n the Western Desert who didn't receive a
packet of cigarettes from Gen. Montgomery. A most
i l l u m i n a t i n g comment on t h i s phase of Haskography i s
his remark, apropas army t e a , " I t would take more than
bromide to subdue me, I can t e l l yeu'.'.
Haskell f i r s t achieved eminence at I.C. as pres-
ident of the Natural H i s t o r y Society. During h i s
reign the society expanded i t s i n t e r e s t s t o embrace
psychic as well as the more 'natural' t o p i c s . In
contradiction to the other learned s o c i e t i e s , the ten-
dency i n the N.H.S. has been to pursue extramural nat-
u r a l h i s t o r y i n a cloak of lighthearted f r i v o l i t y .
Haskell, already thus becloaked i n his intramural act-
i v i t i e s , oould not help at times i n c i t i n g the club to
lighthearted frenzies but tenuously related to nature
study.
In the summer of 1950 Haskell was nominated f o r
the Presidency of R.C.S. His agents, with the a i d of
devious corrupt practices - which cost a small fortune
i n beer money - managed to secure h i s e l e c t i o n . At
the estimate of h i s work f o r the Union the harshest
denigrators would admit that Pete has considerably
s t i r r e d the p l a c i d flow of routine college l i f e . He
has consistently and c o n t i n u a l l y brought before our
notice the existence of other possible ranges of act-
i v i t y ber. l e s beer and sport( not that he disparages
these essentials - i n h i s cups Haskell has o f t and
aye proclaimed "Vive l e Sport I") Whether o f not the
college i s r e a l l y interested i n these "other ranges"
i s a matter h o t l y disputed i n these columns. In the
meantime Haskell continues i n h i s e f f o r t s to achieve
some i n t e g r a t i o n between the "mechanics" of I.C. and
our long-haired brethren over the road.
Evidently Pete i s interested i n the humanities.
Who else shows such e r u d i t i o n i n Rabelais, Boccaccio
and the lewder Latins? A born sophist, he would
l i k e to be able to t a l k to anybody about everythinr

F i n a l l y a few measurements. External length of

gives r i s e to the c h a r a c t e r i s t i c outward convexity at
the knees which has led many to regard H a s k e l l , mis-
takenly, as a cavalry wallah.
And, I almost forgot, Pete's greatest feat of t o r -
tuous argument must have been i n persuading his wife,
Betty, to marry such a scoundrel.
