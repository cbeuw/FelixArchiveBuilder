Another film in which music plays
an important part is Good to Go
which unlike some of its
predecessors actually has a
reasonable narrative
Set in Washington, a group of
local lads are trying hard to get
some recognition for their Go Go
music (heavy funk) but they are
constantly hindered by the activities
of a few rowdy Angel Dust takers
and a racist policeman. Detective
Harrigan is a man who falsifies
police press statements to implicate
the club in which the band plays and
tries to damage the black
community. Into the area comes
aging Art Garfunkel desperate for a
good story to rescue his career.
When he discovers the truth about
the area, he is prevented from
publishing and chased by Harrigan.
The film is fairly well made with
excellent acting from all except
perhaps a few of the musicians but it
does show a tendency for
gratuitious slow motion and a
fascination for feet, though perhaps
in a movie about such foot tapping
music this is not without reason.
The soundtrack, and not just the
music, is very well used and there is
a neat plot device at the end to
curtail any sentimental heroism in
GarfunkePs revelations. Thefilmis
a powerful insight into the black
American community where one in
two lives in poverty, one in two
teenagers is out of work and where
homicide is the leading cause of
male deaths, it's just a pity that this
particular fictional community's
saviour was white.
'There are no points for 2nd place'
and 'though we are not at war, we
must act as though we are', thus the
instructor sums up the philosophy
of the US Navy'sfighterweapons
school, known as Top Gun.
When some Americans looked at
the statistics for kill ratios in the
most recent conflicts they
discovered that in the Korean and
2nd World War the US were
shooting down 15 enemy planes to
every one American, in Vietnam
this was down to about 5:1. Having
decided that the reason for this was
the modern pilots reliance on
missiles rather then dog fighting
skills the fighter weapons school
was set up to correct this. Top Gun
is afilmbased around that school,
and when I tell you that the film is
whole-heartedly endorsed by the
Pentagon you'll probably realise
that it won't be by this liberal
reviewer.
Tom Cruise (Risky Business,
Legend) plays an unorthodox flyer,
Maverick, who gains a place at the
school where he is arrogantly
determined to be the best. He is
assisted in this quest by his
navigator, Goose (Anthony
Edwards) and he is hindered by his
opponent Iceman (Val Kilmer) the
antithesis of Maverick and his'
navigator, Slider (yes, I'm sorry they
all have silly names it's all part of the
'whoop-whoop, alright, yeah, yol'
mentality required for the American
military). The love interest is
provided by Kelly McGillis
(Witness) as an astrophysicist. Her
first official introduction is via a shot
of her black-stockinged legs in a
tight skirt, such is the role of women
in the film. In fact the first
appearance of a woman in thefilmis
a pair of legs in a bar and even Ms
McGillis' character, Charlie, is not
saved from the r61e of supportive
partner by her status or
qualification; the well being of the
pilots is all that matters.
It is interesting that all the combat
situations shown at the school show
the Americans as the aggressors,
but when it comes to reality, the
final crisis situation sequence at the
end, the E. European block was
shown to be at fault. Once again
unfortunately the Eastern block is
portrayed as an evil aggressor
behind dark visors.
Apart from in my view, its highly
suspect ideology, the film does have
some stunning photography,
courtesy of Jeffrey Kimbal, and this
is wholly in keeping with director
Tony Scott's strong visual sense.
The action sequences are very
impressive, with a couple of sloppily
edited exceptions. The love scenes
are awkwardly handled and are not
helped by unsuitable music. Most of
the film has a driving rock score that
is entirely appropriate for the
macho activities portrayed.
Nevertheless it's a well made and
entertaining film, I even began to
quite like Maverick, the arrogant
little jerk, in spite of myself, it's just a
pity they have to be quite sojubilant
about killing people.

About last Night is afilmbased
on David Mamet's play Sexual
Perversity in Chicago but
obviously the producers weren't
going to release a film with that
name and along with the title has
gone some of Mamet's incisive
comment on American society,
though not all of his sharp, realistic
dialogue.
Rob Lowe and Demi Moore star
as two independants who do not
normally go in for stable
relationships and find out what
happens when love takes over. It's a
fairly sanitised film with none of
Mamet's disturbing revelations but
with the great redeeming feature of
Jim Belushi, who has all his brother
John's capacity for degeneracy but
a far greater acting ability.
-Theatre-
This new comedy deals with the
life of Franz Kafka in thefinitedetail
the man utilised to question his own
world.
In a variety of settings and
theatrical styles, Kafka's Dick
follows the evolvement of this great
20th century writer; and examines
his relationship with fame,
immortality and oppression. Had
Max Brod, Kafka's oldest and
closest companion obeyed his
friend's dying wish, there would
have been no Kafka. Brod had
promised to burn all Kafka's
writings.
The opening scene (1920's)
combines the paranoid melo-
dramatic Kafka with the 'Jewish
New York' humour of Brod. This
setting is only by means of an
introduction, for as Kafka talks of
his dreams of the future, the scene
rapidly changes and the action
moves to the present day living
room of the typically middle-class
white household of Linda, a
housewife, and Sydney, an
insurance broker, conveniently
obsessed by Kafka. The normality
of this situation is shattered and
devastated by a series of strange
happenings. It is not usual for Max
Brod, who is dead, to arrive at the
front door carrying a wet tortoise
that metamorphoses into Franz
Kafka. The possibilities this raises
are endless, but Bennett wisely
chooses to explore Kafka'
Books
If you like travel books youH love it,
if you don't you won't, but
unfortunately I don't think that
Kevin and I in India is likely to be a
bestseller. Were it written by Clive
James or Daphnie Du Maurier
maybe; however this collection of
anecdotes, though amusing,
doesn't really hang together. Frank
Kusy's book does have a wealth of
fascinating details, like the hotel
massage men, sunrise over the
Ganges or the illegal demolition
teams that knock down buildings in
the middle of the night to avoid
police detection, but it is all very
much from a Western view. It would
be useful for anyone contemplating
visiting India, as it gives descriptions
not only of all the shrines, temples
and tourist spots you might come
across, but also all the tricks and
dodges that the con-men use.
Costing £4.95 it is published by
Impact books.
If its cheap or free books you're
after, don't forget the Oxfam shop
on Ken High St, plus the Gloucester
Road Bookshop, a brilliant second
hand shop just South of (you've
guessed) Gloucester Road Tube
Station. Finally, while hunting for a
housing benefit form I bumped into
an excellent library on Hornton
Road-just off Ken High St by the
Macdonalds.
disillusionment when he discovers
that Brod has not burnt his work,
and that he is in fact, highly
acclaimed and famous. The
appearence of Kafka's evil father,
Hermann and his impotent mother
press the underlying issue of
Kafka's paradoxical desire for
immortality and oblivion still
further. Finally, an amazing set
change accompanied by much dry
ice finds all the characters in
heaven, but this is still only part of
Kafka's dream-like delve into the
future, and he concludes... 'Heaven
is going to be hell' as he drifts back
to the 1920's.
Kafka's Dick is at times very
funny,and Alan Bennett has found a
true balence between various styles
of humour and a far deeper
intention.

The
Years Of
Phoenix
This year marks an important
centenary in the history of
Imperial College. In December
the Phoenix, the annual literary
magazine at IC, will be 100
years old.
The Phoenix was founded in
December 1886 by the science
fiction novelist H. G. Wells, one
of the College's most illustrious
graduates. Since then it has
seen a string of talented, and
sometimes notorious, editors.
In 1942, the editor was one G.
Wilkinson, now Professor Sir
Geoffrey Wilkinson, FRS, head
of the Chemistry Department.
Patient research has shown
that he is the only Phoenix
editor to receive a Nobel Prize
(so far).
In the 1950s David Irving
became editor. He left the
college under a cloud, and
came to prominence recently
as a neo-Fascist historian, in
the Hitler Diary controversy.
More recently, editors have
included the novelist S. J.
Marshall, who also edited
FELIX (1980-81). Marshall
brought a new level of
professionalism to the Phoenix,
and set the standard for
subsequent issues.
Unlike FELIX, the Phoenix
has seen its share of women
e n t i r e , the latest being Diane
Love, who was a PhD student
in the physics department until
recently.
The magazine has published
contributions from staff at the
college, as well as students.
College security officer
Geoffrey Reeves has become
well known for his
contributions in comic verse,
and Dr Bernard Lamb, of the
life sciences division, for his
humorous, and sometimes
satirical, prose.
This year the editor is Chris
Edwards, Chemistry 3. Chris
says that there is just time for
students to send in
contributions to the FELIX
office: short stories, poems,
photographs and essays—all
are still required.
The Phoenix will go on sale
in November, and Phoenix
Centenary Week will be from
24 to 28 November.
The action-packed week will
include: on Monday 24
November, a special Wellsoc
lecture; on Tuesday, a lecture
in collaboration with the
department of humanities; on
Wednesday at lunchtime, a
careers seminar for students
interested in pursuing a career
in writing; on Thursday, a
launch party for the Centenary
edition of Phoenix; and on
Friday, a Grand Buffet Dinner
in 170 Queensgate, the
Rector's official residence.
More details will appear in
FELIX in coming weeks.
