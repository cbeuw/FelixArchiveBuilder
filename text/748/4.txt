Chris Edwards on the gift horse of student bank accounts
No sooner do you receive that little
chit from UCCA telling you which
college has accepted you, than the
banks start to trip over each other
in the melee for who gets the most
student accounts opened with
them. Handbooks arrive bulging
with inserts promising free clocks,
money, overdrafts and credit cards,
and the Sunday supplements
miraculously sprout full colour
two-page ads extolling the virtues
of bank accounts.
However, despite all the glowing
promises, the glossy booklets and
prose borrowed from washing
powder adverts, the offers they
make bear remarkable similarities,
even if the philosophies differ.
The incentives tend to remain
around the area of £10 in your
account when it's opened, a £200
guaranteed overdraft, no bank
charges and the ubiquitous cheque
and autobank cards. NatWest
currently leads the field with 34%
of the market with this sort of
combination along with their
proud boast of having the largest
number of branches on campus as
well as autobanks.
Midland, once the furthest
behind with a lacklustre package
and little publicity, have managed
to pull into second place by
offering choices of cassette tapes,
quartz clocks and money backed
up with a National Express Coach
discount card and cheaper
traveller's cheques. However
Lloyds used to suffer from an
over-gimmicky presentation with
competitions and cheap
subscriptions to New Scientist, but
very little in the way of solid help or
tangible gifts. However they have
now fallen into line with the
NatWest system, offering £ 10 in the
new account and a £200 guaranteed
overdraft.
"Bad boys" of the student
market, Barclays have unsurpris-
ingly fallen back to 4th place with a
market share of 1
8
% following an
active boycotting campaign by
unions around the country. Who
wants to be a victim of the new
apartheid for Barclaycard users?
They have also suffered from a no-
nonsense campaign spurning free
gifts, concentrating on their
services, which are also just like the
NatWest system. But in an attempt
to revive their flagging
performance they have tried a late
entry with a cheap / I L O F A X Clone.
Operating without the stigma
attached to their big brother in the
VISA syndicate, the Royal Bank of
Scotland and the Co-operative
Bank have stepped up their own
package of incentives to capitalise
on the advantages of giving away
credit cards with nowhere to use
them. The Bank of Scotland has
opted for the Nat West formula,
but the Co-operative Bank, riding
on its policy of lower bank charges
has come up with a different
approach to the traditional
discipline of a regular monthly
statement."
T Co-op would prefer to
"educate" students into using
credit cards as much as possible.
However, a quick glance at the
interest rates and the surcharges on
VISA cash advances (currently
about 1.5%) compared with the
standard overdraft rate for
students, even on large overdrafts,
reveals that the credit card is an
expensive way of borrowing
money, which even the Co-op's
promises about lower bank charges
cannot hide. Credit cards have a
monthly interest rate of 2%, which
adds upto 26.8% over a year, while
overdrafts rates tend to hover
around the 11% mark per annum.
Think about it.
The fact that all of the banks are
prepared to offer these incentives,
and in many cases bend over
backwards to give students large
overdrafts (at least up to the £1000
mark), is an indication of how
much they prize having those
accounts. Students of today tend to
become the executives of tomorrow
with charge cards andfivefigure
salaries — all useful capital for the
banks to draw on. They also tend to
take out bigger loans from those
same banks. People tend to be
loath to change bank accounts, and
it is often difficult once you begin
to become overdrawn to any
extent. The net result is that once a
bank has a customer, that customer
CREATIVE
BANKING
Among the things in life that one can
always rely on, along with the phon
ringing while you are in the bath, and
the good ones always being taken,
the truism that banks, and bank
managers are there only to help
themselves, and ifin theprocess the
happen to help you, then so be it, but
this is not their primary aim. With
this firmly in mind I invented the
concept of creative banking.
Creative banking is the process of
mutual use, and abuse, where the
balance between bank and custome
is redressed. IfI seem a little callou
in my analysis of the situation, then
bear in mind that with over two
hundred thousand students at
universities and polytechnics in this
country, the banks handle nearly two
hundred million pounds of studen
money, and the interest they make
from that.
What is more, creative banking
can befun. Really. Speaking as one
with a wardrobe full offree alarm
clocks, statement holders, and
pseudo-leather cheque-book
holders, I can vouch for this. The
basis of this Creative Banking is to
open as many bank accounts as
possible, and credit card accounts as
well, and play bank against bank

now no longer need an LEA Grant
cheque to open an account, being a
customer of all seven banks is a
possibility. Also, between seven

«as many free gifts as

Midland have stopped offering the
guaranteed overdraft of a couple of
hundred, prefering to arrange
overdrafts individually with
students in a bid to cut down on
people going massively overdrawn
for long periods of time. They see
the overdraft as a method of tiding
students over between grant
cheques rather than a loan.
package. In an effort to combat the
badly overdrawn accounts that
Midland are so worried about, they
have decided not to offer automatic
overdrafts but to give away a VISA
card with the higher credit limit of
£250, compared with the usual
£100. In the words of the Co-op:
"We believe that it is far better to
allow them to have a VISA card
with a modest credit limit and the

always only be too ready to offer
just that little bit more. However it

It is important to open all
