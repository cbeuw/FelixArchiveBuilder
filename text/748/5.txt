Foreign Fields by Don Adlington
Of British universities only Oxford,
Cambridge and Imperial College
have established formal arrange
ments for considering student
expedition proposals and providing
practical support, invariably
accompanied, for those proposals
receiving approval, by a grant.
The Exploration Board is a
College committee comprising
academic staff, representatives of
the Old Students Association, and
five students. It has a chairman,
treasurer and secretary appointed
by the Rector, and an equipment
officer who looks after the Board's
store and issues equipment on loan
to expeditions. The regular income
comes from the College, from the
Imperial College Union and for the
past three years we have also had
most welcome financial support
from the National Westminster
Bank.
Since 1955, the College, through
its Exploration Board, has
supported 112 expeditions,
involving many hundreds of
students. Imperial College
expeditions have travelled to
virtually every corner of the world.
They have climbed high mountains;
explored deep caves; traversed
deserts and artic regions; worked in
equatorial forests and on remote
islands. They have used virtually
every means of transport including
sledge, ski, mule and canoe. All
these students have come home
feeling that they have accomplished
something of lasting value in terms
of their personal development, and
which for many of them could only
have happened in the context of a
properly organised expedition.
What kinds of things do student
expeditions do? Expeditions
approved by the Board in 1985 and
1986 may give some idea (though
you would in fact have to look over a
number of years to get a proper
view of the range of possibilities):
1 a group of geology students
travelled to the Baltistan region of
the Karakorum in North East
Pakistan with the primary aim of
making a large scale geological map
of a particularly interesting area in
the continental collison zone.
2 two final year chemical
engineers, joined by two colleagues
from Kings College, carried out an
entomological project and an
ecological study of an extensive
region of the Western Sahara.
3 seven members of the
Mountaineering Club travelled to
East Africa to climb in Kenya and
Tanzania.
4 three students from the Mineral
Engineering Department under-
took an extensive Landrover
journey through large tracts of
Africa, visiting many gold and
diamond mines, with a view to
studying location differences in
mining across the continent.
5 five second year biologists
carried out a six week scientific
programme working from the Royal
Society's Field Studies Centre in
Borneo.
6 eight members of the IC Caving
Club spent two months caving at
high altitude in the Rocky
Mountains.
There is, of course, no reason at
all why students should not go off
and do exciting things in other
countries entirely without reference
to the college, and very many do so.
If the intention is to have an
expedition, however, as opposed to
an adventurous holiday, there are
we believe some enormous
advantages in using the Exploration
Board. In the first place expeditions
gaining the Board's formal
recognition have the status of
official College ventures and may
use the College's name and
considerable reputation in this field
in their approaches to other
organisations for financial and other
help. They will have easy access not
only to the body of expertise
available in the College, but also
eminent authorities in a wide variety
of settings outside the College. The
Board's approval almost invariably
carries with it a monetary grant, and
most expeditions borrow
equipment from our stock, which
would otherwise have to be bought
by the members themselves. The
Board also ensures excellent
insurance cover at no cost to the
students themselves.
The disadvantage—if such it
be—of seeking the Exploration
Board's suport is that there is a
certain degree of formality involved.
Expeditions are expected to submit
coherent proposals with well
defined objectives and, on return, a
comprehensive report. The Board's
treasurer maintains a degree of
control over expeditions' financial
accounts and over insurance
arrangements.
If you have the germ of an idea
(and that's all you need to begin
with) for an expedition in 1987, we
would be very glad to discuss it with
you at an early stage. Simply ring Dr
Schroter (Chairman) on Int tel:
4083, or me on Int tel: 3041
(Don Adlington, who is the Student
Counsellor, is also Secretary to the
Exploration Board).
For the past few years the
Exploration Board has taken the
first three slots in the regular
Tuesday lunchtime lecture
programmes, attracting out-
standing speakers, and large and
appreciative audiences. Our three
speakers this year are as follows:-
Tuesday 7th October 1986
John Porter, just returned from K2,
on 'The 1986 K2 Expedition'.
Tuesday 14th October 1986
Richard Crabtree 'Living and
working in the Antarctic'
Tuesday 21st October 1986
Tony Waltham 'Through the
Limestone Mountains of China'.
All talks, accompanied by slides, are
at 1.15pm in the Pippard lecture
theatre, fifth floor, Sherfield
Building.
