Pie In The Eye For Welfare Advisor
Lesley Gillingham, the Student
Welfare Advisor, was flanned
during the Undergraduates'
Reception on Monday when five
raiders dressed in Guilds Hit Squad
livery stormed the stage. Four
members of the IC Union Executive
were also flanned. The Guilds office
later refused a request by Rag
Chairman Man Tai Tseung for a
'hit' on the Post-graduate Freshers'
Reception.
Miss Gillingham is understood to
have been quite upset by the
incident which took place despite
the Union Executive's endeavours
to present 'a mature image' at the
reception. She is particularly
concerned that the raiders did not
ask her permission for the 'hit'â€” a
customary service when members of
staff are to be the target.
Union President Christine Taig,
who described the attack as
'childish' and 'irresponsible', said
that further steps would be taken
should the Hit Squad step out of line
again.
Starwars Journal
Following the passing of a motion
condemning the Starwars program
at its annual delegate conference on
the 13th of May, the Association of
Scientific Technical and Managerial
Staff (ASTMS) has began moves to
widen the Star Wars issue.
A special Starwars edition of the
ASTMS Journal which has a
circulation of 400,000 will explain
some of the problems and fears
surrounding the starwars
programme.
The Supplement is being collated
by John Fecamp the ASTMS
representative at Imperial College
from information supplied by the
Peace Groups, FELIX and other
sources. 'We need to convince
people that Starwars is morally
wrong', explained Mr Fecamp, who
is anxious that ASTMS members
should not be forced to work on
Starwars without being given the
option of alternative work
Clive Jenkins, Chairman of
ASTMS is adamently opposed to
SDI, which he described to FELIX
'As an absurd immoral concept
which will either kill us all or else
will bleed our resources'.
Forced
Resignation
An engineering student was
persuaded to resign his sponsorship
with Royal Ordnance pic at the end
of last term, after writing an article
condemning arms manufacture for
the Christian Magazine Chi Rho.
It is unclear how the company
obtained a copy of the article from
the magazine, which has a
circulation of five hundred. A
spokesman from the student's
department told FELIX that
information on students' extra
curricular activities is not passed
back to sponsoring companies. The
student concerned declined to
comment on the incident.
RCS Hon Sec
Resigns
The RCS Hon Sec, Mark Mockett,
has resigned his position in order to
concentrate on his studies. Mr
Mockett, who failed his first-year
exams because of illness and was
unable to take resits, will now have
to take two sets of exams at the end
of the second year.
FELIX asked Physics Senior
Tutor Dr Engel whether pressure
from the department had been
placed on Mr Mockett to resign. Dr
Engel pointed out that Mr
Mockett's entry into the second year
was not conditional on his
resignation.
SDI Book Withdrawn
A book written by former DOC
Research Manager Richard Ennals
has been inexplicably taken off the
presses by its publisher John Wiley.
The book 'A Question of
Initiative', is critical of the
American Starwars programme and
expresses the view that SDI will
prove harmful to research in British
Universities.
The publishers, part of an
American group, have declined to
say why the book has been
withdrawn.
Mr Ennals resigned his IC post
last January in protest against SDI.
He told FELIX that the book
contains no information that hasn't
already been published, and
speculates that outside pressure may
have been placed on the company.
He will be holding discussions with
the publishers in the next couple of
days. Mr Tam Dalyell MP will raise
the matter in the House of
Commons.
New Kitchens
The new Kitchens installed in
Falmouth Keogh Hall have been
favourably received. Peter
Hallworth, Managing Surveyor,
says he feels that the staircase
kitchens are 'the best solution' to the
problem of providing amenities. An
important reason for the change was
to provide a proper place for the
fridge-freezers and refuse bins that
used to be on each landing,
conflicting, with thefireregulations.
Residents now have one smaller
kitchen between twenty-six people
rather than a large one between
seventy-two.
Whether the same scheme will be
followed in Tizard and Selkirk is not
yet resolved. Student opinion will be
sought and the matter will have to
go through the Hall Committees,
said Peter Hallworth.
Rhino Rescue
The first assignment for Dr Iain
Thornton, now Chairman of the IC
Centre for Environmental
Technology, will be a Rhino Rescue
project at the Lake Nakuru
National Park in Kenya. Dr
Thornton, an environmental
geochemist, will collect samples of
soil, water, and vegetation eaten by
the Black Rhinoceros in the hope of
finding the reason for the high
incidence of the cobalt deficiency
which is afflicting the Rhino
population in the area.
