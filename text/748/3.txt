News. FELIX, Friday October 3 1986 3
Pay as you enter
Students attending Monday's New
Year Party were charged an extra £1
for tickets owing to confusion over
the price. Most people who turned
up on the door expected to pay £4,
but the cost was rounded up to £5
because of inadequate provision of a
cash float.
The party had been advertised at
two different prices, and the
treasurer of the Entertainment
Committee, believing that the cost
was £5, had not taken steps to
supply enough £1 coins to be given
out as change. Ents chairman Dan
Phillips could not be contacted
yesterday, though earlier this week
he told FELIX how successful the
event as a whole had been, and
Union President Christine Taig said
yesterday that 'We will have to
make sure that it does not happen
on Friday'. ICU DP Jackie Pierce
said that she felt the price was rather
high, particularly bearing in mind
that the event had a 'semi-captive'
audience, though she agreed that it
was normal practice to raise the
charge made at the door.

FELIX NOTICE TWO
There is a staff meeting today (Friday) at 12.30 lunchtime
in the old office. Anyone interested in learning more
about FELIX will be very welcome. There is also a cheese
and wine party at 6.00 pm.
Many people came and told me
how easy the beginning of term
puzzle, Room Roulette, was, but
were there any answers given in
to the F E L I X o f f i c e by
Wednesday? No. The deadline is
n o w next Wednesday, 8th
October, 1.00pm, the same as
this week's puzzle. So get those
answers in, you might be the
only person who enters, and
there's still £5 to be won!
Money for old dates
"Fancy some money for old
rope?" said Tim Skint, famous
financial disaster area.
"Oh yes, is this another of your
completely unfeasible money-
making schemes?" I said.
"No, no, there's nothing to this
one. I've got hold of this pile of
old calendars, all we have to do is
Tippex out the did year, add in
1986, and we can flog 'em at a
profit. The days match, look at
my birthday for instance — it's
on the same day of the week
back then as it is this year."
I expressed my dubiousness
about the project and pointed
out a problem.
"Yes, but look at my birthday.
Back then it was on the same day
of the week as yours, but this
year it was on the day of the week
before it was then."
"Ah," he said. "
I see the
problem. Oh well, at least you
can make a FELIX problem out of
it."
"How's that?"
"Well, if you add the two days
of the month of our birthdays
you get the same total as adding
the two months. Also if you
multiply the two days of the
month of the birthdays together
the digits of the answer are the
relevant months. From that
information it is possible to tell
the exact dates, in full, of both
our birthdays."
So that's this week's problem.
There will be a £5 prize for a
randomly selected winning entry
picked after 1.00pm Wednesday
8th October. Entries to the FELIX
office please. One last point, you
don't need to look at any old
calendars to solve this puzzle-
good luck!
IF YOU FEEL
UNSAFE
about getting home after the Freshers Ball
tonight, then go to security (Beit Arch) on
the half hour, 11.30 onwards, and we will
get you home, or give you a place to sleep.
