Sabbaticals. FELIX, Friday October 3 1986 8

The first Imperial College Union
General Meeting (UGM) is next
Tuesday at 1pm in the Great Hall.
DONT MISS IT. It won't be like the
Constituent College Union General
Meetings that you had the chance
to go to on Monday. It is your
chance to run the Union. It is your
chance to debate motions about
real issues. It is your chance to find
out exactly what your sabbaticals
do.
Imperial College Union General
Meetings are (hopefully) well
organised meetings which have
some influence on College and
control the Union. They start with a
reading of the minutes of the last
meeting and a discussion of the
matters arising. This is normally
uncontroversial and is normally
completed in five minutes.
The sabbaticals are then
expected to report on what they've
done since the last UGM. They will
prepare a written report and then
make additions to it verbally. This
really is your chance to question
your sabbaticals because when
they've completed their verbal
Hugh Southey
additions you can quiz them about
any aspect of their job. Sabbaticals
are paid by you so it's worth trying
to find out if they are really working
for you.
At some UGMs the Honorary
Secretary reports as Returning
Officer. This means that he
organises elections for Union posts.
CCU Presidents and other
officers then make reports. These
are usually just a list of facts.
The most controversial part of
the meetings is usually the motions
which are detailed after the officers
reports. Anyone can submit a
motion about anything. If you want
to submit a motion all you need to
do is submit a motion to Union
Honorary Secretary Dave Colley a
week in advance.
This order of business can be
changed by procedural orders but

meeting.
Believe me, IC UGMs are
important. They can change your
residence, bar, lectures so try and
attend.

As Freshers' Week goes on, the
shadows under my eyes get bigger
and blacker and my temper gets
shorter! I hope you've been having a
good A»eek and that your stamina's
better than mine.
Overseas Freshers' Reception
Day
More than 200 people came along
to the Overseas students' reception
last Sunday organised by the Union
and Lesley Gillingham, the College
Welfare Adviser. This is the first
time the Union has organised such
an event and it seemed to go fairly
smoothly. Thank you to everyone
who turned up, I hope you enjoyed
yourselves. If you've got any
constructive criticisms, do let me
know. Thanks also to everyone
who helped out, especially Norman
Jardine, for dealing with the food,
which brings me to the subject of...
The Snack Bar
From Monday October 6
'Norman's' will be open in the
evenings as well as lunchtimes, for
snacks and meals. The bar will also
be open, so now you can eat and
drink in comfortable surroundings
in the Union Building—good stuff,
at low prices! To celebrate, come
along to the Opening Night Party on
Monday where you'll get extra-
cheap food and drink and
entertainment into the bargin.
On a more practical note, we are
trying to keep the new decor in
Norman's in good condition. Please
help by sticking posters—with
Blutack only-on the textured vinyl
covered walls not on the paintwork;
don't stub cigarettes out on the
floor or the tables-use the ashtrays!
and please help us to keep the
snack bar end of the room a non-
smoking area. Thanks.
Attention all poverty-stricken
students
Monday night was great fun-I
enjoyed all of it except cleaning up
at 4am. If anyone wants to help us to
clean up after tonight's party, well
pay you good money. There's also
work available in Norman's
especially from 9am onwards, so
anyone with a free morning would
be more than welcome. Come and
see Jen or myself in the Union office
if you're interested.
Finally
Kari Suvanto, Physics first year,
you left your Union card behind on
Monday night collect it from the
Union Office.
Have fun tonight-see you
there/on Monday/at the UGM.
