The Newspaper Of Imperial College Union Founded 1949
On The Streets
Imperial College has passed up the chance of
another Hall of Residence. Early this summer,
College officials viewed a property in
Bayswater which had formerly been the Hong
Kong students' centre. The deadline for tender
has since passed, but Imperial has failed to
make a bid to acquire the buildings.
College Assistant Secretary
Michael Arthur said yesterday that
the property was not really suitable
for a Hall of Residence since the
majority of rooms were designed as
triples. Mr Arthur added that a very
significant investment would be
required to bring the buildings up to
standard, and that this would
jeopardise all other accomodation
projects for the forseeable future,
including the development of the
new Hall on the north side of
Princes Gardens. However, there is
no shortage of applicants for Evelyn
Gardens where most of the rooms
are doubles and triples.
Bloody Ridiculous'
Nearly 200 students are still looking
for places to live after the Student
Services office was swamped with
applications for the remaining 100
college rooms. The majority of the
places available will have been re-
allocated by today.
In previous years there has been
sufficient space within Halls,
Houses and head tenancies to give
rooms to students who arrive at
college without arranging any
accomodation. The Student
Services office said yesterday that
the number of rooms available had
fallen from around 150 for last year.
This was in part due to a rigorous re-
allocation of rooms which had been
offered to students but not
confirmed by them. The majority of
the places now available had been
offered to students who failed to
arrive at the start of term. In a
statement from IC Union yesterday,
the situation was described as
"Bloody ridiculous."
N
o Noise
The Rector, Professor Eric Ash, has
sent out a letter to students in
Southside asking them to tone down
their behaviour and the noise they
make, a theme which he repeated in
his address to undergraduates on
Monday.
Prof Ash warned that throwing
objects out of windows and playing
loud music could jeopardise the
planning permission for a new hall
of residence which may be built over
the sports centre in Princes
Gardens.
The Union President is
sympathetic with the Rector's
requests, having received
complaints about the noise levels in
Evelyn Gardens.
"The College can't afford to upset
nearby mews residents, most of
whom have expensive solicitors,"
she explained.

Over The Odds
Students attending Monday's New
Year Party were charged an extra £ 1
for tickets owing to confusion over
the price. Most people who turned
up on the door expected to pay £4,
but the cost was rounded up to £5
because of inadequate provision ofa
cash float.
The party had been advertised at
two different prices, and the
treasurer of the Entertainment
Committee, believing that the cost
was £5, had not taken steps to
supply enough £ 1 coins to be given
out as change. Ents chairman Dan
Phillips could not be contacted
yesterday, though earlier this week
he told FELIX how successful the
event as a whole had been, and
Union President Christine Taig said
yesterday that 'We will have to
make sure that it does not happen
on Friday'. ICU DP Jackie Pierce
said that she felt the price was rather
. high, particularly bearing in mind
that the event had a 'semi-captive'
audience, though she agreed that it
was normal practice to raise the
charge made at the door.
Big Noise
Police arrived at the Freshers' New
Year's Party on Monday following a
complaint from Queen Alexandra's
Women's Hostel that the noise level
was too high. The situation was
quickly resolved by turning down
the band's PA system.
Loud bands appearing at today's
Freshers' Ball will be placed in the
Union lounge in order to prevent
further complaints.
