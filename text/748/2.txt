Life
In A
Northern
Town
Dear Sir,
As an ex-student and Station
Manager of IC Radio for two years
(between 1981 and 1983) I like to
keep moderately 'in touch' with
what is going on at this College.
It was with some dismay, not to
say anger, that I heard on IC Radio
a news report containing an extract
from the 'Welcoming' address to
first-year students given by the
Rector, Professor Ash.
In this speech, after stressing
(quite rightly) the opportunities
available to students at IC to visit a
number of interesting museums in
the vicinity, he summed by by
asking them 'not tofindthemselves
in some God-forsaken factory in the
North of England somewhere' (his
bad syntax, not mine) wishing they
had taken advantage of the virtues
of the South which he had just
extoled.
This is indeed a welcome for
students from the Northern
counties! As a Yorkshireman I
remember about halfway through
my first Spring term feeling
somewhat disenchanted with the
attitude of several Southerners I had
met. If Professor Ash had been the
Rector at thattimeI would certainly
have felt that I had made a mistake
in coming here. Now, with my five-
figure salary and my comfortable
lifestyle in London (while many
academically able friends are
standing in dole queues two
hundred miles away) I should
perhaps be grateful for the naivety
of my youth.
Perhaps not. After all it cannot be
easy to live in some God-forsaken
mansion in SW7 without ever
having visited (or even recognised
the existence of) the National
Railway Museum in York, the
National Museum of Film, Theatre
and Television in Bradford,
Steamtown at Carnforth, seen the
Lake District or the Bronte
Parsonage at Howarth or heard the
•Halle Orchestra or English National
Opera North or even the Black
Dyke Mills Brass Band!
But enough of my hopefully
forgivable Northern indignation. As
a graduate of City and Guilds
College, which I trust still guards
jealously its reputation as the finest
engineering college in Britain, I find
the Rector's remarks equally
infuriating if the target of the
adjective 'God-forsaken' was the
factory rather than the North. The
idea that industry is a career to be
looked down upon is one that many
eminent people outside as well as
inside the engineering profession
(the Prince of Wales is one person
who springs to mind) have been
trying to eradicate for many years.
Had such remarks as those I refer to
come from the Chancellor of
Oxford University (which I doubt
that they would) then we engineers
and scientists would no doubt
spring to the conclusion that he was
out of touch with the modern world.
That they should come from the
Rector of the Imperial College of
Science and Technology is
astounding!
If Professor Ash had urged his
new students not to end up doing
voluntary Service Overseas in some
Third World hell-hole there would
no doubt have been an outcry (at
least I would hope so). I hope he
realises that to make this sort of
remark is just as offensive.
Yours Faithfully,
Neil Sykes B.Sc. (Eng) A.C.G.I
Entry
Rules
Attacked
Dear Dave,
I'd like to thank Beit security staff
for their help at the New Year's
Party on Monday. I believe there
have been complaints about the
union card check system operating
at Beit Arch, perhaps I'd better
explain.
The Union has only just been
granted its own licence for the
premises. This is not a full
performance licence; our chances of
getting one of those are less than
zero, as the local residents are
unhappy enough about us running
two or three major events like this
each year.
It is inevitable, on an occasion
like Monday, that someone will
complain to the police about the
noise level in the area. It is a'lso likely
that, since our licence.is new, we are
being WATCHED anyway. There
is no way we can afford not to
comply with the licencing
regulations; hence the card check.
Imperial College Union has a
reciprocal agreement with virtually
every local college. All the students
from those colleges needed to do
was to show their own union cards
to be let in. OK, so there was a bit of
a queue-better than the alternative,
a court injunction stopping us from
holding anymore parties of this sort.
Yours,
Christine Taig
College Accommodation
College administration have
assured us that the former Hong
Kong students centre was
unsuitable as a new hall for
Imperial. When FELIX contacted
College's Assistant Secretary,
Michael Arthur, we were told that
the report drafted on the possibility
of the scheme was classified as
'confidential'. It is difficult to see
why, if the administration is
genuinely enthusiastic about
expanding IC's student accom-
modation, the report on a possible
new hall should be restricted. Mr
Arthur says that 'it was decided' not
to pursue a policy of searching for
and redeveloping existing
properties unless they were
eminantly suitable. In the light of
the rush, for Hall places in which
200 students are likely to loose out,
IC Union should demand to see a
comprehensive report on the
viability study carried out on the
buildings. I am far from convinced
that the project was looked at in any
detail.
FELIX
Over the past few weeks FELIX
has been produced because many of
the regular staff are prepared to go
without any sleep. They would like
me to point out that if more people
come and work on FELIX they may
able to get to bed before 6.00am. If
you are even remotely interested in
working for this amazing rag,
please turn up to the staff meeting
at 12.30pm today in the FELIX
office (Beit Arch).
