Clubs FELIX, Friday October 3 1986 9
Photo Soc
A new club is being formed at
College: the Photographic Club.
If y o u are interested in
photography, whether you are a
beginner or an advanced
amateur, and want to improve
your skills or meet other
photographers, then join the
Club. We will be having
competitions and an exhibition
at the end of the year as well as
outings to various places and
workshops. We also hope to
have lectures from professional
photographers. If you are
interested come to our meeting
in the Senior Common Room
12.30pm to 2.30pm on Thursday
October 9th and see Alan Foum,
Geology 1.
Chess
A fair amount of interest has
been shown amongst the
freshers for the Chess Club.
There has also been a great deal
of interest amongst regular
participants of the Club from
previous years.
The Club is not only interested
in those veterans who can play
seemingly without flaw but also
those who enjoy the game
irrespective of their standard.
The idea of a club at university is
to enable people to participate in
activities that they would
otherwise not have the chance to
try. The Chess Club has many
attractions in that it enables
players of any standard to
improve their game and enjoy a
relaxed atmosphere. The players
are able to meet new people both
in and out of the College, in a
sociable atmosphere which is
often lacking in other clubs. (I
shall not mention any for fear of
insulting your intelligence and
the other clubs). The Chess Club
is not only involved in playing
plain chess as you might
imagine. It also tries to diversify
with such things as lightning
chess tournaments simultan-
eous exhibitions and different
forms of chess (cross chess,
cylindrical chess and others).
Notably the lightning chess
tournament is being held on
October 9th. I would very much
like to see you there and if you
would like to discuss any
aspects of what I have written or
of chess please do not hesitate to
approach me (Haldane Broby
Life Sci, Treasurer Chess Club)
at the lightning tournament.
Third World First
Unknown to many at Imperial
College there exists a small but
thriving group called Third
World First. The group is active
in organising meetings, socials
and campaigns for the Third
World. During the term there will
be meetings exposing the work
of Rio Tinto Zinc; Friends of the
Earth will be talking about the
decimation of the Tropical
R a i n f o r e s t s . We have a
campaign week organised for
October 27th followed by a two
day fast.
There are close links between
Third World First and other
pressure groups s u c h as
APTECH and joint meetings are
planned with oversea student
groups. Third World First is
supported by a hard core of
dedicated people but it needs
more. If you are interested in
what's going on in the World
come to our first meeting on 7th
October or contact me or Helen
Udy.
