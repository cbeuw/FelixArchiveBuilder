A
s a human being, it is
likely that you have
walked (or wheeled) our
many pavements. And
as an Imperial student,
it is even more important that you are
equipped with the latest up-to-date
pavement knowledge. You don’t want
to be caught loitering on some Telford
gravel, when you could be meandering
around on a Tar Macadam. This is an
article to keep in your bedside drawer
next to your problem sheets and dust-
Suspended peat
Senator
Pestering Plebian
Ancient Cash
machine
The earliest pavements date back to
Ancient Greece, where slabs of dried
peat were suspended on sticks, allow-
ing the senators to commute to work
from their leafy Athenian suburbs.
The concept was to walk on the under-
side of the peat and avoid the pestering
homeless plebians, camping outside
early Ancient Greek cash points.
Despite early successes, the pave-
ments proved to be inefficient, owing
to the overwhelming effects of gravity,
which was yet to be discovered.
It wasn’t until 1687 when Newton fa-
mously dropped his child off a bridge
and observed the lack of his return that
gravity was discovered and pavement
technology leapt forward in advances
In 1845, Tony Pave took the lead in
revolutionising the paedestrinisation
of the British capital and introduced
the first ‘pavement’ outside Bucking-
ham Palace, allowing Queen Victoria
to walk to Marks and Spencers without
being run over by a horse and cart.
However, Jeffery sidewalk, an Amer-
ican civil engineer, accused Tony Pave
of stealing his invention and took him
to court. The ten year-long feud result-
ed in fourteen civilian casualties and
the assassination of US president Lin-
coln. Eventually the case was settled
and ‘pavement’ became the accepted
British terminology whilst ‘sidewalk’

THE ESSENTIAL REVIEW - PAVEMENTS
That’s right, forget film, music, science, travel, politics, business, news and sports. This is a f*cking pavement!

Dey weren’t women. Dey wer sexy ladies lol.
But it wasn’t dat song. It was our acoustic cover
of Mylie Cyrus
SUPERACEGORTHEROAR87
WTF? 4 the song ‘killin them sexy ladies’ wher u
take women hostage and brutally behead them?
was universally accepted as ‘the re-
tarded equivalent’ in America.
A bit of road but like on the side and
for people and it’s higher up.
We took a team of experts around the
UK and scoured the roadsides with a
fine toothcomb. We reviewed every
single pavement for its structural in-
tegrity, walkability and pavementiness.
We dedicate this review to our head of
research, Professor Ivan Gvontmakher
Heine, who sadly lost his life to a badly
laid 1851 Victorian Woburn Cobble.
We subsequently had to take extreme
protectvive measures for the rest of the
trip and had a sniper team watching us
at all times. We have chosen the best
and the worst pavements in the UK.
WHAT EXACTLY IS A PAVEMENT?
HANGMAN’S PAVEMENT REVIEW Dorset Polyconcretis
★✩✩✩✩
Vintage Kentish Blue
★★★★★
One of our researchers was physically
sick at the sight of this concrete mon-
strosity. The glossy surface is the mark
of funding cuts by the local council.
With the lowest walkability index al-
lowed by regulation, this really was the
most unenjoyable stroll in the UK.
This may look like rubble, but is in
actual fact the artwork of the 1960’s
Swedish NewWave pavement designer,
Oskar Brauner. Hangman loves this
relic of the Sixites, embodying the
carefree attitude of the era. Potholes
and cracks are an artistic interpreta-
tion of human nature. Vintage Kentish
Blue is now protected by the Biritish
Heritage Committee and is revered
across the globe as the greatest pave-
ment to ever grace the feet of mankind
CONTROVERSY
In 1986, the Pavement Maintenance
and Management magazine (Issue 1)
reported on a revolutionary product
that was to take the world by storm. It
was called the Tarmax R-100, and was
used to provide ultra-high perform-
ance seal coating. It was so good that
there were riots in all of the worlds’
major cities due to the lack of global
supply, leading to the 1980’s recession.
Earlier this year, Hangman was fortu-
nate enough to get exclusive tickets to
the National Pavement Expo in Nash-
ville, Tennesse. Here we managed to
interview the leading authorities on
pavements, and got their thoughts on
the future for the roadside. Bob Krebs,
Head Chief of Asphalt Innovations,
spoke to us about how 2010 will be an
exciting year for roads:
Hangman: Hey there Bobby, we hear
2010 will be an exciting year for roads,
is this true?
Bob: Yes.
Hangman: Excellent, thanks for your
time Bobkins.
We also spoke to a leading official in
the field of Concrete Forensics who
reassured us that the British singer,
Adele, has been drastically misin-
formed about tectonic pavement
shifts. “Pavements move a maximum
of 20 cm a year. The general public do
not have to worry about ‘chasing pave-
ments’. The notion is absurd’
