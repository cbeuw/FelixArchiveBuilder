The Brit Awards have come and gone!
The artists of the day all met up together in Earls Court last Tuesday for a good old jamboree, to congratulate each
other and make merry. Luke Turner knows they’re all winners but are they really the worthy victors?
Remember the Grammy Awards... No? Well, this puzzle might
jog your noggin. Work out the names by combining each picture
consecutively and be reminded of the winners.
