Election-fever
heats up once again
I
t’s that time again. The biggest
elections of the year began last
Tuesday when the window for
nominations opened. This win-
dow will last till Monday the
1st of March, and gives any student
of Imperial the chance to put them-
selves up as a candidate for any of the
positions available. These include the
sabbatical officers; President, Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies), Deputy
President (Finance & Services), Deputy
President (Welfare), Deputy President
(Education), and Felix Editor. These six
positions will require taking a year out
of your degree and working full-time
with Imperial College Union. Non-
sabbatical posts include four student
trustees.
Last year saw a record turn-out for
the Felix Editor election, which saw
Dan Wan, Kadhim Shubber and Zoe
Dobell fight it out for the 30% voting
turnout. Wan narrowly scraped the
victory by a marginal 60 votes over
2nd place Shubber. Shubber has iter-
ated his interest in running for a sec-
ond time. The rumour mill has started
turning for other positions also, four
people already putting their names
forward for Union President barely a
week after nominations opened.
Every position so far has at least one
candidate, and these elections look to
fire up College once again with some
surprising names appearing to stand.
To look at the full list log into www.
imperialcollegeunion.org/vote.
To stand for a position this year,
you’ll need to log into imperialcol-
legeunion.org/vote, follow the links
and get 20 other students to second
you. Once you’ve got the 20, you’re
officially a candidate in the elections.
Campaigning starts 2nd of March,
so voters should get their sweet-teeth
ready for the buckets of free candy
that’ll be thrown your way.
A
member of Imperial Col-
lege Mountaineering
Club (ICMC) fell 100ft
whilst climbing in north
Wales on Saturday 13th
February. He was climbing with three
other Imperial students during a trip
with the ICU club which took place on
the Welsh mountains of Cwm Cneifion
in Snowdonia.
The fall occurred as the climber was
trying to negotiate a steep section of
ice which had come to be known as
the ‘Tower Slabs’. He tumbled through
100ft, the height of a 10-storey build-
ing, before safety equipment arrested
his fall. If it were not for his ropes and
his belayer (climbing partner) he would
have fallen another 150ft and possibly
would have suffered much more seri-
ous, if not fatal, injuries. The climber is
considered to be very lucky to have es-
caped injuries other than a split lip and
a broken bone in his face. His belayer
suffered no injuries.
At the time of the fall, two of the lo-
cal mountain rescue team happened
to be close to the scene and were able
to offer help and first aid to the fallen
climber. They feared that the fall might
have caused internal injuries, so the
Sea King helicopter was swiftly sum-
moned and the injured ICMC member
was airlifted to Bangor hospital for a
medical examination.
Chris Lloyd is a team member of the
two rescuers who offered assistance
after the fall, from the Ogwen Val-
ley Mountain Rescue Organisation.
He describes the events of that after-
noon, which actually began with an-
other party of nine requesting aid for
a suspected broken leg. “At 2pm, we
received a call to help someone with
a broken leg…in a party of nine from
Chester. Our team were called and 22
Squadron from RAF Valley came in
to help.” Within a matter of minutes,

Simple!
whilst the man with the suspected
broken leg was being attended to,
Mr. Lloyd said that his team received
another call “regarding a 19-year-old
man from Imperial College. Two of our
team members were actually climbing
nearby and witnessed what happened
so they went to help him straight away.”
The Sea King helicopter immediately
rushed the Imperial student to hospi-
tal, who was feared to have suffered
internal injuries, and then returned to
the scene to rescue the man with the
suspected broken leg.
The Imperial Mountaineering Club
was described as being well equipped,
and the fallen climber was described
by Thomas Coyne (Chair of ICMC) as
“experienced”. Mr. Lloyd has criticised
the other group of climbers for being
ill-equipped to deal with the hard snow
and ice. “This year has seen a number
of cases of people getting into trouble
due to lack of ice axes and crampons
on fields of hard snow.”
The reason for the fall is believed
to be due to the crampon used by the
fallen climber. Jonathan Hazell is one
of the four Imperial students who were
climbing in Snowdonia at the time
of the fall. He told felix: “Something
went wrong with the crampon and it
seems the most likely explanation is
that the rear retainer-clip popped out
or sheared off.” He pointed out that:
“there’s no real evidence of what hap-
pened as all that’s gone is a small clip
which can be removed anyway”, and
also admitted that: “I’m still going to be
using the model of crampon in ques-
tion just with some tape/cable tie to
hold the clip in place.” Hazell will soon
be going to Norway to climb ice for a
week.
After the accident, the remaining
members of ICMC continued their
climb and the injured member was re-
leased from hospital the next day.

“The Sea King helicopter
immediately rushed
the Imperial student
to hospital, who was
feared to have suffered
internal injuries”
