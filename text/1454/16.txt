Greg Power: So Jonas, how are the re-
hearsals for the new album going?
Jonas Renkse: Great, we’re at home,
practicing the new songs for the first
time as a band since the album was
recorded. We’re excited about playing
them live.
GP: Your latest release Night is the
New Day is very different from the al-
bums you made before.
JR: Yeah, it was a harder writing proc-
ess this time, but we’re happy with the
result. We haven’t written songs just by
jamming as a band for 10 years, so it
was a more rewarding experience.
GP: You’re playing with new members
live though?
JR: Well we recorded the album as a
five-piece, but after it was done the
second guitarist Fred and bass player
Mattias left because they’ve got fami-
lies now.
GP: No more rock n’ roll excess?
JR: (laughs) No, they can’t anymore.
They’d been with us for a while too.
The new guys are great though.
GP: How long’s the tour going to be?
JR: It keeps growing, man. It’s seven
weeks for now, we’re going all round
the world. We’re starting our European
tour in March, then it’s Scandinavia,
Vocalist Jonas Renkse (aka Lord Seth) and guitarist Anders Nyström formed the
Swedish metal band Katatonia in the early 90s, and have been consolidating an
ever-growing fan base since then. Starting out as doom metal, over recent years
Katatonia have moved towards a form of “dark rock”, retaining goth and metal
tinges. Though Swedish goths may not have a reputation of being the most cheery
bunch around town, Renkse was more than happy to answer my questions as
Katatonia prepare for their upcoming European tour. - Greg Power

The closing date is: Friday 26th
February 2010
then we’ll try to do as many summer
festivals as we can. We’ll end in the U.S.
GP: It’s a new sound you’ve achieved
with “Night Is the New Day”. You’ve
ditched screaming and are singing
throughout.
JR: Well, I try to sing.
GP: How did that switch come about?
JR: I lost the technique because we
weren’t rehearsing enough, and growl-
ing is like anything: if you don’t prac-
tice, you lose it.
GP: And Mikael Åkerfeldt (Opeth
frontman) replaced you on vocals for
a while, right?
JR: For a full-length album and an EP.
He’s a really good friend of ours, along
with the rest of Opeth.
GP: Åkerfeldt called your new album
one of “the greatest ‘heavy’ record[s]”
he has heard in the last 10 years and “a
masterpiece”.
JR: (laughs) Yes it was cool hearing
that.
GP: The album has gotten great re-
views all round, so your switch to sing-
ing must have paid off.
JR: Definitely, we’re thrilled that peo-
ple like it. The band is taking a step for-
ward. I think we found and created our
Planet was my favourite. Also, Tool’s
10000 Days. I’ve been listening to
Tool since the 90s, they changed my
songwriting.
GP: Did you listen to Puscifer, May-
nard James Keenan’s solo project?
JR: Well I tried to, but I just couldn’t
get into it.
GP: So they’ll be no electro-comedy
solo album from you then?
JR: (laughs) Not yet at least.
GP: Is it all metal, all the time for you?
JR: No, I listen to a lot of different
styles. My favourite singer is Mark
Kozelek, from Red House Painters
and Sun Kil Moon. It‘s just acoustic
guitar and soulful vocals, I love it. I
also love Nick Drake, and lots of jazzy
stuff.
GP: A solo jazz album maybe?
JR: I would definitely love to do one,
but I’ll probably try to incorporate that
stuff into Katatonia’s music.
GP: Last two questions. What’s your
poison?
JR: Well, I mostly just drink beer. But
I guess if I have to choose, I’ll go for
White Russian.
GP: Like in the Big Lebowski.
JR: Exactly.
GP: And since this is for Imperial Col-
lege, do you have a favourite Star Wars
character?
JR: Aw man, you should be talking to
Anders. He’s a massive Star Wars nerd.
But I’d have to say Darth Vader. The
Dark Lord!
An audience with the Dread Lord Seth
own spot in the metal world. When we
started the band we couldn’t even play
instruments, it was just courage and
hunger. But we’re hungrier than ever
to give more musically, even after 20
years.
GP: So new album and band members,
is it a fresh start?
JR: It feels like it.
GP: Would you still call yourselves
“metal”? Or as your website describes
it now, “dark rock”?
JR: Well the same core darkness is still
there. We’re metal fans to start with so
our “style” is up to whoever’s listen-
ing. “Dark rock” is PR, but I guess it’s a
good description.
GP: The decade’s out. Any ideas for
best album of decade?
JR: Porcupine Tree’s Fear of a Blank
