ICSM Drama take on The Scottish Play
F
or the first week of March,
the Union Concert Hall will
be transformed into mediae-
val Scotland as ICSM Drama
put on their production of
Macbeth, by the immortal bard, Wil-
liam Shakespeare.
For those of you who can’t tell your
Hamlet from your Henry V, Macbeth
is the bloody tale of a man, as he strives
to become, and remain, the King of
Scotland. Teased and tricked by the ee-
rie, otherworldly witches and goaded
on by his devious wife, Macbeth yields
to his dark ambitions to become the
king. Once on the throne, he ruthlessly
sees off real and imagined threats to
his royal claim. But the murder and
betrayal take their toll as both Mac-
beth and Lady Macbeth are plagued by
ghosts and inner demons.
Macbeth is the third major produc-
tion for ICSM Drama this year. Hopes
are high that it will follow on from the
successes of the Freshers’ Plays and
Arsenic and Old Lace in the Autumn
term, while at the same time moving
away from comedy to more serious
drama.
Shakespeare has a long history at
Imperial but this has been largely due
to productions by IC Dramsoc, their
last being Much Ado About Nothing
last summer. In the past, ICSM Drama
have tended to shy away from the bard’s
work. Some members have quailed at
the thought of putting on Shakespeare
and more importantly, doing it justice,
while others have shunned it in favour
of more contemporary works.
Taking a bold step then into the di-
rector’s shoes are Paul Fairhurst and
Se-yi Hong. Turning a centuries old
text into a living, breathing play is no
easy task but as they say, a burden
shared is a burden halved. Some might
argue that having two directors can
only hurt a play as no one artistic vi-
sion can come to the fore. However,
that is definitely not the case here as
each director plays to their respective
strengths. Paul Fairhurst is firmly in
charge of the dramatic side of things,
coaching the actors on their stresses
and guiding them through the un-
familiar language, while Se-yi Hong
masterminds the choreography of the
production. Between them, they make
sure that everyone can talk the talk and
walk the walk.
Together, they have laboured to
present this seventeenth century piece
in a new way for a new audience.
Within the play, there are themes of
androgyny and confusion which the
directors choose to highlight with
some surprises in the casting. The
parts of the witches are to be played by
male actors while the murderers have
been cast as women. They have also
decided to go back to basics in terms
of wardrobe and scenery. Rather than
get swept away by elaborate backdrops
and meticulously accurate costumes,
the play will be performed on a largely
bare stage, as so not to distract from
the power of the bard’s blank verse.
This is not simply a cheap attempt
at lowering production costs but seeks
to highlight and underscore the emo-
tive themes of the play. The result is
a coruscating production not to be
missed. It promises to be accessible
to all; a faithful adaptation for those
well-versed in Shakespeare, while not
being over-familiar, but also an excit-
ing and novel production for those
previously turned off by fussy, dusty
English teachers, and those that have
never been turned on at all. You don’t
have to look too hard to see the diver-
sity of those involved. ICSM Drama
regulars rub shoulders in the cast list
with the freshest of freshers, some of
whom only cut their acting teeth in the
year’s earlier productions. But despite
the differences in age and experience,
the cast are dedicated to the produc-
tion and the hard work they, and eve-
ryone in backstage and tech, have all
put in since January, and will continue
to put in until late into the night of Fri-
day 5th March. So next week, why not
come along? You might think that you
had put Shakespeare behind you with
GCSE English but a tale filled with
murder, betrayal and naked ambition
will never go out of style.
Amnesty Imperial make sense of the trajic situation in Darfur
T
hough conflict in Sudan
has been ongoing since its
independence from Brit-
ain in 1956, it wasn’t until
violence escalated in Su-
dan’s region of Darfur that it started to
receive worldwide coverage. Human
rights organisations such as Amnesty
International started to raise aware-
ness of the conflict, publishing reports
and demanding UN intervention for
the region. Colin Powell, when he was
secretary of state in the US, called the
conflict in Darfur genocide, though
Amnesty International prefers to avoid
such terms - there is no doubt that
massive human rights atrocities were
occurring.
Sudan is a country composed of
many different ethnic groups, with
the north being mainly dominated by
Muslim Arabs and the South being
dominated with black Africans. There
have been two civil wars since Sudan
gained independence from Britain, the
last one ended in 2005 with the deaths
of 2 million people. The war started off
as a conflict between North and South
though as time went on and the Arabi-
an National Congress Party took pow-
er in 1989 for the southern Sudanese,
it became a war over resources and the
freedom to be allowed to follow their
individual religious beliefs.
One of the worst conflicts began
in 2003 when the government tried
to squash an uprising in the region
of Darfur. It armed and supported a
group of Arab militias called the Jan-
jaweed to target rebel villages. As a
result, at least thirty thousand people
were killed, thousands of villages were
destroyed, people were raped and tens
of thousands were displaced. To bring
an end to the many conflicts, in 2005
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement
(CPA) was made between the differ-
ent groups giving the South semi-au-
tonomy for six years and drawing up
the framework to resolve many of the
“Stars, hide your
fires. Let not light
see my black and
dark desires.”
causes of the conflicts.
This framework was to be put in
place by 2011 and included support
for the division of oil revenues and a
National Land Commission to nego-
tiate the division of land between dif-
ferent groups. However as yet violence
continues in Darfur and most of the
framework to be put in place as part of
the CPA has been delayed.
It can be difficult to fully appreciate
the situation in Sudan when newspa-
pers and news programs only every
few weeks briefly mention that a few
more villages have been burnt and a
few more people have been killed. Of-
ten it can seem that it is just another
part of the “African problem”, one of
those problems which since it isn’t go-
ing to go away anytime soon is best
ignored. However in less than a year
from now, a solution to this problem
may be in grasp. As arranged in the
Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the
referendum which will allow Southern
Sudanese people to decide for them-
selves whether they wish to stay as part
of Sudan is going ahead.
In the last few weeks, thousands of
activists have been gathering around
the world to mark the five year anni-
versary of the Comprehensive Peace
Agreement (CPA) and to call for ur-
gent steps to be taken to secure peace
in Sudan including:
• Increasing the UN peace
keeping force (UNMIS) in Sudan to re-
inforce the protection of civilians and
so that its personnel can be deployed
swiftly to areas of conflict.
• Increasing the amount of
diplomatic support to the Northern
and Southern Sudanese parties so that
they can resolve the issues of wealth
sharing, borders, and security
• Provide intensive support
for the legislation for the referendum
which is taking place next year, and
increase international monitoring of
human right violations occurring in
Sudan in the run up to the referendum.
Amnesty Imperial has been doing its
own campaigning to raise awareness
on the situation in Sudan. Two weeks
ago, one of our members gave a talk
highlighting the genocide in Darfur
and the next event planned is going
to highlight the conflict in Sudan all
around campus.
The society will be marching around
campus as part of the Sudan365 cam-
paign, organised by a group of people
which are encouraging people every-
where to drum for Sudan and submit
a video. Sudan365 was formed on the
10th of January 2010: 365 days before
Southern Sudanese people will be giv-
en a referendum.
Since many famous drummers such
as Stewart Copeland of The Police and
Nick Mason of Pink Floyd are involved
in the campaign, the group decided
that drumming for peace would be its
tagline.
It is hoped that by raising awareness
more pressure will be put on govern-
ments to unite and give support to the
referendum, which will hopefully bring
an end to the conflict and peace for Su-
dan. Hopefully the campaign by Impe-
rial Amnesty will heighten awareness
around campus lending more support
for Sudan in this crucial time period.
‘The result is a cor-
uscating production;
faithful and accessi-
ble to all.’
‘One of the worst
conflicts began in
2003 when the gov-
ernment tried to
quash uprising in the
region of Darfur.’
‘The society will be
marching around
campus as part of
the Sudan365 cam-
paign.’
Plenty of fake blood to be bought by the ICSM Drama society
