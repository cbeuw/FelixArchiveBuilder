Ponyo
Miyazaki reminds us how animation should be done
a little girl grow even more. But we
know that this fun, sweet and innocent
relationship cannot last too long, since
her father, the ruler of the underwater
empire is, for some reason, very keen
to get her back, unleashing strange but
wonderful oceanic creatures to help
with the process.
Though they sound childish and full
of naïve fantasy and fairytale ideas,
one must never underestimate the ex-
traordinary range of humour and sub-
tle depth that Studio Ghibli films are
capable of, keeping adults entertained
throughout. This is largely because
once again, Miyazaki ventures into his
world of seemingly limitless imagina-
tion and turns Ponyo into something
truly magical. Shifting the focus back
and forth from the underwater king-
dom to dry land, the film boasts the
artistic talents of the crew with spell-
binding locations. The endless crea-
tivity is reflected in the invention of
numerous
mystical creatures which all have in-
triguing parts to play.
The sequence of events moves at a
hyperactive, chaotic pace, much resem-
bling the driving style of Sosuke’s moth-
er, Lisa, who has absolutely no trouble
driving through a gigantic storm – she
doesn’t even hesitate when there’s no
bridge to cross. Lisa is even so tough
that when a tsunami hits the surround-
ing seas, she doesn’t remember or care
at all about her husband who’s out there
trying to survive on a wonky ship.
Several environmental issues are
hinted at – Ponyo’s father disapproves
of how his sea is always being contami-
nated by humans, and Ponyo is almost
artistic talents of the crew with spell-
binding locations. The endless crea-
tivity is reflected in the invention of
numerous
but Miyazaki never makes it become
the major part of the plot and moves
swiftly along. This was made as a fam-
ily adventure film and he intends to
stick to that idea.
The ending feels a little rushed,
with a sudden introduction of a major
character who completely changes the
course of the film. But it doesn’t stop
it from being a delightful, feel-good fi-
nale. And don’t forget to stay until the
end to listen to the pleasantly chirpy
song whilst the credits roll.
Although the film never feels as com-
plex as Miyazaki’s previous efforts,
there’s no denying that Ponyo is yet
another triumphant animation achieve-

This is a
must-see for
everyone –
a stunning,
caught in a huge fishing net along with
other poor fish and junk in the sea –
sweet animation treat that is guaran-
teed to please audiences of all ages.

Hayao Miyazaki is back in the direc-
tor’s seat after a couple of highly suc-
cessful Studio Ghibli films (Howl’s
Moving Castle and Spirited Away). De-
spite the recent developments of com-
puter animations and 3D technology,
he sticks to making hand-drawn films
and continues to amaze us by how de-
tailed and stunningly beautiful their
pictures can be.
Ponyo adapts the well-known story
of The Little Mermaid. Ponyo is a cute
and adorable half-fish, half-human
princess who longs to live outside of
her father’s kingdom. One day, she
manages to escape and is found by
a 5-year-old boy, Sosuke. They
form an instant friendship
and as time goes by,
their bond strength-
