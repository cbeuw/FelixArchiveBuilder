Chip-and-PIN yourself
into a world of hurt
Simon Worthington looks at the so called ‘secure’ Chip-and-PIN
verification system and how it might not be as safe as you think
T
he days of securely paying
with plastic are over. It’s high
time we all went back to pay-
ing with paper money, or
perhaps even doubloons. They’re both
probably safer than the current elec-
tronic system we have in the UK, the
infamous ‘Chip-and-PIN’. Last week,
eminent security researcher Ross An-
derson and his team published a paper
identifying a huge security flaw in the
system that governs all of our real-life
credit and debit card transactions. The
take home message of the paper was
that our cards are not, and have never
been, as secure as we all thought.
Before our current system, bank
cards carried just the magnetic stripe
that stored the account details of the
card. Cashiers would swipe the card
and ask for a signature from the cus-
tomer, which would then be compared
to one written on the back of the card.
It meant the decision of whether or not
the signatures matched was up to the
cashier. This system worked pretty well
for the customer, except for the fact it
was pretty open to fraud from forging
of signatures or card cloning of stolen
cards on which new signatures could
be written. Chip-and-PIN was devised
as the security mechanism that took
the discretion out of the hands of the
cashier and made the whole system
electronic. Cards now include a chip
that authenticates the transaction us-
ing a PIN known only to the user,
which is entered into a card terminal
when paying. The idea was that this
would make stolen cards worthless
whilst also removing any liability from
the cashiers and by extension their
employers.
The whole authentication process is
actually quite complicated, with data
and numbers being transferred up and
down and all over the place, but the
important part happens when you ac-
tually type in your PIN.
The PIN is punched into the termi-
nal’s keypad and sent to the card. The
card then decides if the PIN is correct
and sends the appropriate message
back to the terminal. The security flaw
arises due to the fact that this conver-
sation between the card and the termi-
nal keypad is not encrypted. A piece of
electronics in the middle can intercept
the PIN entered on the terminal and
simply return a ‘yes’ message which
looks as if it originated from the card,
regardless of whether the PIN was cor-
rect or not. The card never even re-
ceives the PIN and eventually just as-
sumes something went wrong and that
the authentication was carried out suc-
cessfully by some other method, like
the good old signature check. Neither
the card, the terminal or even the bank
has enough information about the
transaction to detect the subterfuge.
So where does this leave us con-
sumers? Well, Chip-and-PIN was also
designed as a system to help protect
banks, shifting all of the liability for
unauthorised purchases onto the card-
holder. If the system worked securely
this arrangement would be fine and it
probably is the consumer’s fault if they
let someone else know their PIN. Now
this security hole has been unveiled it
means that thieves have a means to use
stolen cards and therefore the card-
holder genuinely isn’t to blame. Banks
can and do hide behind the fact that
purchases are supposedly ‘verified by
PIN’, with at least one court case us-
ing this as evidence of consumer neg-
ligence. This weakness brought to light
by Anderson and his team, however,
suggests that this might not always be
the cause. Unfortunately for consum-
ers, until this hole gets patched, which
will take a very, very long time, or the
justice system wakes up to the fact
that Chip-and-PIN is broken, there is
very little protection for card-wielding
consumers.
What can you do to protect your-
self? Very little, apart from vigilance
at the terminal and ATM. Check the
card slot for any foreign devices such
as skimmers and make sure the termi-
nal doesn’t look like it’s been tampered
with before you stick your card in it.
Watch those statements kids.
T
his week has seen the annual
Mobile World Congress take
place in Barcelona. MWC
is THE place where mobile
device manufactures come to show off
their latest wares and where journalists
flock to attempt to chart what we can
all expect for the mobile year.
This year Microsoft stole the show
with what can only be described as
a mobile resurgence with Windows
Phone 7. OK, so Windows Mobile/
Phone 6 and 6.5 run quite a lot of
phones out there, but it’s been a dead
duck for the last two years. With com-
petition from Android, the iPhone, the
ever-present RIM and Palm’s webOS,
it was about time Microsoft brought
themselves into the modern smart-
phone game.
Windows Phone 7 series represents a
serious paradigm shift from Microsoft.
Not only is it based on Windows CE6,
like the Zune HD, but they’ve com-
pletely rewritten their UI playbook.
Gone is the reliance of a stylus to get
things done, the humble finger reigns
supreme, as it should. In fact, Windows
Phone 7 is so drastically different from
its predecessors and any other phone
operating system out there at the mo-
ment, it’s pretty hard to describe.
Microsoft calls its interface ‘Metro’
and it is essentially like a Zune interface
blown up and extended. Drawing more
from its Zune and Media Centre expe-
rience than Windows, Metro is heavily
reliant on motion and typographic ele-
ments forged in a high contrast, mini-
malist UI. Gone is any degree of alpha
shading, bevels or modern accents that
Apple and co, insist on splashing eve-
rything with. That’s not to say Micro-
soft’s ‘chromeless’ design lacks polish,
but it’s a simplified plain interface that
really suits the small screen.
Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
Another week, another tech
story and there’s plenty of them
to choose from this week, so
let’s get cracking, OK?
First up for your gadget
gorging pleasure is the world’s
first 4G netbook. The Sam-
sung N150 packs your usual
netbook fare, nothing really
to shake a stick at apart from
the LTE modem (that’s Long-
TermEvolution
for those keeping
track). Boast-
ing potential
speeds of
100Mbps
down/50Mbps up, real world
tests showed Sammy manag-
ing roughly 28Mbps which, to
be fair, is faster than my home
broadband. A lot to get excited
about then.
Perhaps even more remark-
able than superfast mobile
broadband was the ‘super’
AMOLED display Samsung
had in its first Bada (don’t ask)
phone the Wave. Although the
phone itself is a bit snooze-tas-
tic the screen really did prove
to be super, showing bright,
vivid and fully saturated colour
in bright sunshine, something
ordinary AMOLED screens
just can’t manage. With all
the benefits of OLED screens,
emitting their own light,
thus saving power and giving
amazing vibrancy plus
outdoors readability, I
really hope Samsung
and others stick this
amazing display in
something a bit more
exciting!
More phone news
from MWC in Barce-
lona this week from a
rather unlikely part-
nership, Puma and
Sagem. The Chav-
Phone, err, I mean the
Puma Phone, features a
capacitive touchscreen, 3.2MP
camera with LED flash, GPS, a
compass and a pedometer for
sporty types. What makes this
little beggar a little different
from the rest is the solar cell
it’s packing on its back for on-
the-go green charging.
Impressive little guy,
but I for one couldn’t
seriously consider
buying something
phone-like with
Puma branded across
it. Look for it through-
out Europe this April.
RIM finally joined
the modern world
this week with a Web-
Kit-based browser
for Blackberry. Finally
Blackberry addicts will
have a fast, efficient mobile
browser that doesn’t suck. Will
this make you buy a Black-
berry? Probably not, but it
will make accessing the web a
much less tiresome affair. Hats
off RIM, that didn’t take long;
only 3 years or so.
Wired was in the news again
this week with more iPad relat-
ed talk. This time it had a fully
rendered demo of
its digital maga-
zine format
which it hopes
to launch on
the iPad come
March. Inter-
estingly, the
digital maga-
zine Wired cre-
ated was wrapped up in Adobe
Air meaning it should be a
quick port to the iPhone/iPad,
if Apple approves it, of course.
The big question is, will punt-
ers pay for something they can
normally get free online? Per-
haps not, but only time will tell.
The ISS this week got its
new window, Cupola, bolted
onto the Tranquillity module.
As you can see, courtesy of
Gizmodo, it presents
pretty impressive
views of Earth and
even looks like
a Tie Fighter to
boot. Awesome.
Bad news for
Adobe this week
as a recent report
indicates malicious
PDF documents made up 80%
of all computer exploits in
2009. It seems Adobe Reader
has become the new mass-
market target for malware.
Doesn’t bode well for students
and researchers where the PDF
journal article reigns supreme.

Return of the
Windows Phone

The Start screen holds rows of tiles
down the middle which are live and
animated with ones that are used more
often promoted to the top. The list of
tiles can be infinitely long and scrolled
down with a swipe.
Status updates and things like that
can be pushed to the tile allowing
you to see them at a glance of the
animation.
Microsoft has also fleshed out the
‘hub’, something that will be familiar
to Zune HD users. Hubs offer a middle
ground between icons and a full blown
application. A hub is an extension of
the OS which can carry content in from
both local or cloud sources, meaning
photo galleries can be browsed right
from a hub.
Think of them as a way to pull in-
formation into the OS without having
to have a separate app running. Mi-
crosoft showed off a variety of hubs
at MWC2010 including a People hub
which pulls in contact information and
status updates from social networks,
contact databases such as Gmail’s
contacts and of course Exchange. The
smart thing about the hub is that the
first screen you see is a dynamically
generated screen with the people you
contact most right in front of you and
a section for ‘Me’ which allows you to
update your status across multiple net-
works. Other hubs featured included
Games with Xbox Live support, the
Marketplace, aka App Store, Music
and Video for all your media, Pictures,
Office and the usual calendar, mes-
sages, email, phone, Bing Maps and
Search, and of course IE mobile.
An impressive turn around for Mi-
crosoft indeed, but how it actually per-
forms in the hand remains to be seen.
I for one am excited to see Microsoft
back in the game, it’s been a while.
