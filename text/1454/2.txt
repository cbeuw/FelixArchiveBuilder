Imperial College’s University Chal-
lenge team sadly broke their winning
streak on Monday in their second
quarter-final match, losing against
Emmanuel College, Cambridge. The
final score was Emmanuel 275 – Im-
perial 160; a very sound defeat after
three glorious previous performances.
The team, Ciaran Healy, Simon Good,
Gilead Amit, Ben Nicolson and Ed
Brightman, as profiled in last week’s
felix, have a final chance to get into the
semi-finals by playing a third quarter-
final match, broadcast on 8th March.
They must win against Girton Col-
lege, Cambridge in order to stay in the

ontinental students planning on visiting Libya over Easter
should reconsider their plans.
Libya has begun to refuse to issue entry visas to Schengen area
citizens in retaliation for Switzerland’s publishing of the names of
180 Libyans banned entry to the country. Relations between Europe and
Libya seem to have hit a new low. In related news, Silvio Berlusconi, Italian
Prime Minister, while announcing a crackdown on illegal immigration and
human trafficking, joked that “we’d make exceptions for anyone bringing
over beautiful girls”.

A
bomb exploded outside the Greek offices of JPMorgan
Chase, a favoured employer of Imperial College students,
in Athens on Tuesday. Luckily, no one was hurt. The explo-
sion comes amid recent allegations from Der Spiegel and the
New York Times that Wall Street banks including JPMorgan have played a
significant part in the raging Greek debt crisis that is currently challenging
the stability of the Euro.

A
train crash in subur-

most twenty dead on
Monday amid heavy
snow. Many more were reported
injured. At the time of this dis-
patch, authorities are waiting to
question one of the train drivers
while they simultaneously exam-
ine both trains’ data recorders.
Eurostar trains to Brussels and
other services have been seriously
disrupted. Early reports indicate
that one of the trains ran a red

venting such an event was not on

competition.
The match started well with Imperial
running ahead and maintaining their
lead for the first ten minutes of the
half-hour programme. Unfortunately
a question about yoga masterfully
snatched by Emmanuel Captain, Alex
Guttenplan got the Cambridge team
the lead and they ran with it, answer-
ing four out of the next five starter
questions. When it seemed Impe-
rial might never get back their form,
the team suddenly powered forward
again and grabbed three starters in a
row. At twenty one minutes, now lag-
ging by only twenty points, anything
still looked possible. Unfortunately it
wasn’t to be and the rest of the quiz
was dominated by the other team
who scored 120 points in just six and
a half minutes. During that time, Im-
perial managed to get just one starter
question: Healy redeemed himself
after a mistake on the quantity ‘h’ in
the Schrödinger equation with his
quick recognition of the capital city of
Kazakhstan.
This programme had the second
highest combined score this series;
the top three highest scoring matches
have all been won by the Emmanuel
team which consists of two students
of medicine, one of French and Latin
and one of Natural Sciences. Of the
game, Imperial’s team captain said
“They were a really excellent team
and impressively fast. It was a great
match.”
