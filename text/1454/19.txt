And Introducing, The Best Of “Overheard At Imperial”
Five year old girls are like simple
arithmetic...best done in your head.
-Mathematician
The odds are good, but the goods are
odd.
-On Imperial Boys
Girls at Imperial are like park-
ing spaces...they’re either taken or
disabled.
-On Imperial Girls
A: I just saw my first penis in real life!
Oh my god, wow!
An awkward silence...
A: Wow, oh wow, oh wow, oh wow!
B: What....er, haven’t you seen them on
your ward rounds?
A: No, no, no, no.
B: So the first cock you ever touched,
you stuck a tube down it? Fuck....I love
your life!
-22 Year Old Female Medic and friend
on inserting her first catheter
Ok, ok, I promise I won’t cum in
your mouth again!
-The end of an argument at the
Union
A: Wow, that’s really small!
B: That’s what she said.
A: Who?
-Guys in Aeronautics
Why is there a dash next to the cof-
fee? Has it been differentiated?
-In the SAF Cafe
Morning was ok. I woke up, took a
piss, then got out of bed.
-Someone in Labs
I’ll do anything to go back to first
year,; I’ll even kill a homeless person.
-Frustrated Third Year
A: Have you ever even been to Leeds?
B: No, not exactly but I’ve been past it.
A: Oh really? Where did you go?
B: Yeah, I went all the way to
Nottingham.
A: Cracking up
The Seasons: Which
OneIsYourFavourite?
I don’t have a favourite but I can’t stand Summer. Why does
sun have to be damn bright! IT BURNS!!!
Very Pale Computing Student
I absolutely love Winter. The snow is so pretty and it makes it
so much easier to hide the bodies!
Third Year Medic
I like the one where it rains a lot. Which one is that again?
First Year

mates - unless it’s really funny. Another disclaimer: That’s actually hand-sanitiser.
”
B: No, wait, was it Loughborough...no
wait...where is Leeds?
-A Loiner, obviously
Maths = Fun2
d(Maths)/d(Fun) = 2 Fun
d2
(Maths)/d(Maths)2
= 0 (No Fun)
-Spotted in a Maths Notebook
A: 15:51 is a really good time because
151’s a good number.

A: Error, cannot cast from face to int.

ian motion.
