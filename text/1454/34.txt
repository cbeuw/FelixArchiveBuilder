‘Clover Power’ can’t help IC Snooker at Midlands Cup
Sam Dennis Snooker
The first weekend of February saw the
first snooker tournament of the year;
the Midlands Universities Snooker
Championship. The two ICU Snooker
teams met a little after 7 am for the
train to the gloriously dull town of
Coventry. Saturday offered a mixed
bag of results: In the Individual Cham-
pionship, Imperial’s number one and
first team captain, Sam Dennis, found
himself in a London derby against
LSE’s top player, Aqeel Qadri. After
losing the first frame convincingly,
Sam, with the help of a 44 break, was
able to come back and win 2-1 with a
round of applause from the spectators.
Moving through to the next round,
he faced York 1’s Matt Robson, whom
he beat two years ago en route to the fi-
nal. This year, however, saw the luck of
the balls running completely in favour
of his opponent; this, teamed with a
poor miss on a vital pink in the decid-
ing frame, saw Sam prematurely crash-
ing out of the event.
Imperial’s Hari Arora also made it
through his first match, beating Man-
chester 1’s Nick Clayton 2–0 before
losing to Mike Walsh of York 1, run-
ner-up in last year’s BUCS Snooker
Championships, by the same score.
The other members of our first team,
Kwan Ng, Duc Tien and Lawrence
Wild, failed to progress beyond their
first matches, choosing instead to “fo-
cus their attention on the team event”.
Our second team had more success
in the Individual Trophy with three of
the five players making it through to
the quarter-finals. These were new-
bies to the team, Amish Patel and Ni-
gel Rozario, along with club veteran
Lewis Guan. Grace Yip, renowned for
her incredibly long matches, became
the first ever female to win a match at
the Midlands Cup, beating Cardiff 2’s
Noah Reynolds 2–1 before a 2–1 loss
to York 3’s John Fox. Second team cap-
tain Will Duncan, renowned for dress-
ing as a pirate, lost in straight frames to
Keiran Baxter of Cardiff 2.
Putting their disappointment in the
individual tournaments aside, the team
events kicked off with the second team
playing a 15-frame match against York
2 in the Team Trophy. Will opted to
play last in the running order in the
hope that the match would be won by
the time he had to play, or as he stated,
“to win the deciding frames if needed”.
Unfortunately, the team found them-
selves 8–4 down—all losing tight
matches two frames to one—by the
time Will got a game, so even with his
2–1 victory against George Hogg, the
team lost 9–6.
In the Team Championship, our first
team seemed to catch the unluckiness
that Sam experienced in the individual
event, and with two draws and three
losses, we lost 8–2 in our opening ten-
frame match against Cardiff 1. Slightly
deflated, we moved to our second
group match against Oxford 1. Once
again, Lady Luck was unkind to us and
despite a 2–0 victory against Joe Sturge
for Sam, in which he achieved the sec-
ond-highest break of the tournament
with 45, the team lost 6–4.
Saturday night, we felt we needed a
little pick-me-up after our poor per-
formances, so we waded into an all-
you-can-eat Indian/Chinese/Thai buf-
fet where we polished off a few jugs of
Kingfisher and had a little too much
fun with the ice cream factory and
chocolate fountain. Morale restored!
Sunday began at breakfast with our
slightly eccentric bed and breakfast
owner. Hearing stories of our misfor-
tune, he disappeared through to the
kitchen to see if he could “find us some
luck”! A few confused looks later, he
reappeared holding a four-leaf clover.
In order to progress to the semi-
finals, our first team had to win 7–3
against number two seeds York 1
and our second team just had to beat
Warwick 2. Now armed with the clo-
ver, there was no way we could lose. It
seemed to be working, with Nigel and
Lewis winning their first frames. Am-
ish was having less success, however
with the rest of the team vigorously
rubbing the clover, Amish’s opponent
then potted the cue ball on the final
pink before hitting his head on the ta-
ble light, both actions met with cheers
of ‘Clover Power!’
Although Will whitewashed former
Imperial team player Joao Bento 3–0,
unfortunately the second team went on
to lose their match 9–6, and with the
first team outplayed and losing 8–2 to
York, both teams headed to the pub to
drown their sorrows of their early exit
from the competition. Now, all sights
are set to next month when our two
teams will head to Leeds hoping for
better results and luck at the BUCS
Snooker Championships.
Deep concentration needed by Imperial to sink the red.
