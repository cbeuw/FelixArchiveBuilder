COFFEE BREAK
felix FRIDAY 19 FEBRUARY 2010
It’s cold and miserable and the Horoscopes offer hope
All you have to look forward to is more snow and no Christmas... Luckily, we can predict your future this week
Cancer
You do too much
work in the library,
and don’t take your
crazy pills. You start
hallucinating that
you have cancer, and
leukaemia, and aids, motor neurone disease,
diabetes, glandular fever, shingles, malaria,
sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, muscular dystrophy,
klinefelter’s syndrome, multiple sclerosis,
tuberculosis and epilepsy. Hypochondriac.
Virgo
On an Imperial
College sailing trip
you get a bit lost. You
keep trying to find
your way back to the
shore, and for some
reason the weather keeps getting warmer, even
though your iPhone says it’s snowing in the UK.
Weeks later, nobody has sent out a search party.
Luckily, some friendly Somalian pirates find
you. Nice :)
Gemini
Your friend buys
you a drink in the
union. You immedi-
ately black out, and
don’t remember the
next couple of days.
When you wake up from your small coma you
go to the bathroom to take a wee. You find you
have no penis. After screaming and crying you
decide to cook something to eat. You find some
meat in the fridge. Tasty.
Pisces
You took a chlamydia
test as part of sexual
health awareness
week. They said
they’d text you your
results in a couple of
weeks. Not to worry, just pee in a pot, right?
Beeeeep beeeeep.
‘Incoming message: You have AIDS.’
You go out to Heaven and pick up some men to
spread the love.
Leo
You take a weekend
break to Tenerife. The
most classy guy there,
works in a bar and has
a Leeds United tattoo
across his back. You
instantly fall in love, drop your knickers in the
bar. He tells you to pull them back up; he wants to
take you to the beach for sex under the moonlight.
They find your body two days later. Sand in your
lungs lets the police know you were buried alive.
Aries
Your best friend
asks you to go out
for drinks with him,
he’s just broken up
with his girlfriend
of five years. He’s
completely gutted. You feel sorry for him so
offer some male bonding time and so go out for
a few drinks. He tells you he’s worried about a
lump. Will you feel my balls? You grope them,
there are six.
Scorpio
You get drunk at a party
and an old man con-
vinces you to take some
some LSD. You think
there are flies flowing
under your skin and
that you fingers are little cocktail sausages. You cut
them off and fry them with chips. You eat them for
supper and feed the rest to your illegitimate love
child.
Libra
Waitrose turned you
down for a part-time
job. Instead you decide
to join an online escort
agency. You’re first
client contacts you
and gives you the address of a house in Mile
End. This worries you slightly, but the agency is
‘respectable’. You knock on the door. A woman
answers. ‘YOU SLAAAAAG!’. Kitchen knife
through the heart. Ouch.
Taurus
You go home for
reading week to see
your parents and
spend some time
in the family home.
When you get back,
you find them in tears, ‘Sorry son, we had to put
the dog down’
. Mum makes dinner... Mmm...
Thai curry - nice one. ‘What else could we do
with Lassy?’ - Mum.
Capricorn
This Valentines day
you go speed dating
in the hope that your
loneliness will be put to
an end and you’ll finally
find love at Imperial.
You’re not that bad, right? You arrive early and
drink too much free champagne. You wake up
in the morning, naked and handcuffed to the
bedpost. ‘Kinky?’ ‘Yes’ said the gorilla lying next
to you. Pint?
Aquarius
This week, your
girlfriend starts
making her self look
more attractive.
Yes! All your friends
comment on how
well you’re doing with such a ‘fit bird’. She goes
to the union on Wednesday, Sports Night, gets
with all of the Ladies Football team and then
tells you ‘It’s over, I’m a lesbian’. Fail.

Sagittarius
So you’ve heard of
this M-Cat shite. You
have some friends who
reassure you that the
biochemistry of it will
agree with your body,
and everything will be fine. You wake up the
next morning and your body is blue. You’re 3m
tall and don’t understand English. You can run
really fast and are really strong. The ‘Welcome to
Pandora’ sign scares the shit out of you.
