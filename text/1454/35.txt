into a sudden death penalty shoot-out.
Fitz couldn’t bare to step up again but
Alex Rybka could and slotted home
sending the Kings through after Mike
Turrell’s miss. In the first semi-final,
the Kick 4 Life team comfortably saw
off a depleted Southside Legends team
and began to eye the title.
The second semi-final was much
tighter with Ahmed’s Mediterranean
Magicians and the Wilson Kings bat-
tling it out. It was scrappy and there
were few chances but the winner came
out of nothing as Sam Rickards drove
a left foot shot into the corner to help
eke out the victory. The stage was set
for an epic final. The Kick 4 Life team
coasted to the final, while the Kings
had to fight their way through every
stage. However the Wilson Kings made
sure that the result was never in doubt,
racing into a 4 goal lead by half time.
Their slick passing game had reached
its peak and no team could have lived
with them.
There was a modicum of fight
left in the Kick 4 Life team as they
scraped back a couple of goals but
the Kings were just too good, running
out 5-2 winners and crowned the in-
augural Imperial College Kick 4 Life
champions.
I would like to think the tournament
was a success, mainly to all the help I
received in organising. So I would like
to thank all the players, in particular
the Captains, who helped me out enor-
mously, thanks to Sim Anandajeyara-
jah for helping out with the finances,
the photographer Jon Gordon, Ed
Lobb for his support, the staff at Ethos
for generously donating playing time
but mostly to the Co-Founder of Kick
4 Life, Steve Fleming, for helping me
through the process and for running
an amazing project.

Imperial Eagles’ unbeaten run ended by Warwick
Stefan Bauer Handball
While the international competitions
don’t seem to be that close and inter-
esting anymore, which I have to blame
the French for, the lower leagues still
seem to have an edge to them. Impe-
rial’s first ever league game in the au-
tumn was against Warwick and, de-
spite a clear loss, gave the team hope
for the rest of the season. They worked
hard and what followed was complete
domination over local rival UCL and
Oxford University, which put the Ea-
gles in a position where they would still
be able to fight for the top spot in the
competition and enter the play-offs if
they were to beat their nemesis.
The Warwick line up was similar to
the one from the autumn game, which
made their tactics predictable. If Im-
perial wanted to claim the two league
points for themselves, they would have
to find a way to condemn the big Ger-
man shooter in the back row and stop
the playmaker from setting up the
pivot in attack, who was also of con-
siderable size. On the other side of the
court the experienced and admittedly
frightening central Europeans were al-
ways going to make it more difficult to
pass the middle block with individual
actions than in our previous games,
which meant that, finally, there would
be a suitable opportunity to try some
of the new and well planned schemes
like “Wurst” and “Dagmar”.
Typically, the Eagles failed to imple-
ment any of the tactical masterpieces
that would have changed the flow of
the first half. Either they spoiled all
their good attacking work by leaving
massive gaps in defence or wasted all
their defensive efforts in attack by con-
ceding avoidable turnovers, which lead
to a 5-goal lead for the guests at half
time.
Consequently, the half-time talk was
simple and merely a repetition of what
was said before the game, but even a
team that cleverly named one of their
attacking schemes after the German
word for sausage and shouts French
phrases revolving around sheep at
each other for motivation, needs to re-
group and realign once in a while.
At the start of the second half, the
game took a new turn. Imperial de-
fended well and attacked smartly,
stretching the guests’ defence with
smooth combinations to set up the
shooters on the wing. In addition to
that, the Eagles’ goalkeeper finally fig-
ured out the complex shooting pattern
of the Warwick team, which cleverly
alternated between ‘throw’ and ‘throw
harder’, and made the shooter look like
a delusional, arthritic West-German
trying to tear down the Berlin Wall by
throwing marbles at it.
With only 7 minutes to go Imperial
had a 2-goal lead, which was well de-
served at that time, but Warwick came
back strong and showed why they are
leading the league. Their defence got
more aggressive and IC was lacking the
routine to bring home the advantage.
In some rather hectic closing seconds,
Warwick converted a final counter at-
tack that would take the game past
Imperial.
All in all it was a very frustrating loss
to suffer and a massive blow to the Ea-
gles’ title hopes, but a necessary lesson
has been learned and, hopefully, the
hard work and fine performances over
the season will be crowned with silver-
ware at the University Championships
in Manchester next weekend.
