I
t’s halfway through February
and I’m still bloody frozen. Yes,
I may be from the Home Coun-
ties and a bit soft but sub zero
temperatures just aren’t right
unless it is snowing and you don’t have
to go to college. Many a day I have
been tempted to skip the exercise of
using of my microscooter and to hop
on the bus. Although this is not so
tempting now that Albert Bridge is
closed and everyone living South of
London uses my road as some sort of
Central London bypass. So whilst it’s
so bitter, Saturdays are now concerned
with working my way through a vast
DVD collection and getting better ac-
quainted with my duvet. As the epony-
mous musicals fan I like to get hold of
filmed productions- the rarer the bet-
ter. So far I’ve enjoyed a production of
Sondheim’s Company where the actors
played the instruments, Boy George’s
musical Taboo and Sunday in the Park
with George, again by Sondheim, star-
ring Mandy Patinkin and Bernadette
Peters.
If musicals aren’t your bag, never
fear! There is still plenty of culture that
can be enjoyed from the warmth of a
bed. Try catching a classic play like A
Streetcar Named Desire or The Cruci-
ble on DVD, or indulge in some Shake-
speare and a cup of hot chocolate. For
the art lovers among you, many galler-
ies have online collections that you can
peruse at your leisure, plus enhanced
features that make you feel less guilty
for not venturing out in the cold.
But there is one thing that you have
to venture out for, Artsfest. This is the
big celebration of everything artistic
and cultural at Imperial.
Taking place next week, each day
will be filled with concerts, perform-
ances, workshops and exhibition with
the main event, the Artsfest Show-
case on Thursday in the Great Hall. I
think I’m performing in that, better go

M
ost of you will proba-
bly never have heard
of Stephanie J Block,
but to those of you
who have, the news
of her first solo outing in London is a
big deal. On Broadway she is a lead-
ing lady with an amazing voice, hav-
ing appeared alongside Hugh Jackman
in ‘The Boy from Oz’, held her own
as Judy Bernly in ‘9 to 5 The Musical’
and originating the role of Elphaba in
workshop productions of ‘Wicked’.
Following a successful appearance
in Scott Alan’s ‘Just Me...And Them’,
SimG productions have brought her
back for her very own concert at the
New Player’s Theatre which looks
set to be an awesome concert I got
to speak to Stephanie in preparation
for this concert and I must say I was
bloody excited to speaking to someone
of such high calibre on the Broadway
scene!
How did your concert at the New
Player’s Theatre come about? How
do you find the intimate concert in
comparison to a huge stage?
I performed in London late last year
with Scott Alan. Simon Greiff pro-
duced Scott’s concert and it was beau-
tifully presented, with a lot of care and
class. Simon asked if I would be inter-
ested in bringing my solo concert to
the West End and I was thrilled! There
is something really special about per-
forming in an intimate setting as one’s
self. I began performing in jazz clubs
in NYC in 2004 and found that I abso-
lutely loved it. It’s a vulnerable position
to be in... standing alone on stage shar-
ing your personal stories and favourite
music. But it is highly gratifying.
What do you have planned for the
concert? Any special surprises?
I am not going to tell you my set list...
You must attend the concert to know
the music. But, yes, there will be some
surprises.
I saw you in Scott Alan’s “Just Me…
and Them” concert last year, how
did it feel to be making your London
debut? And how do you feel London
audiences compare to Broadway
audiences?
I was extremely nervous coming to
perform in London, but I had the buff-
er of Scott Alan. I know how much he
is loved over there. And that helped to
settle my nerves. I found a very warm
welcome when I stepped onstage and I
can only hope that happens this time
around.
I never expect any particular re-
sponse from any audience whether it
be a regional, Broadway or a London
crowd. You have to earn an audience’s
appreciation, respect and response. I
plan on “earning it” on the Feb. 28th.
This is your second trip to London,
what do you enjoy most about Lon-
don and if you ever get to just be a
tourist, where are your favourite
places to go?
The last time around, I did have some
time to be a tourist. I did a little Christ-
mas shopping in Notting Hill. I saw the
National Theatre’s production of “War
Horse”... incredible! And I was able to
spend time with some dear friends.
This trip I will be taking a day to give
a master class at MTA. Then there will
be rehearsals with the band and guest
vocalists (Annalene Beechey, Oliver
Tompsett and, just recently onboard,
Hadley Fraser... sensational artists
in their own right. I am so lucky and
grateful to be able to share this experi-
ence with them). And then, of course,
the two concerts on Sunday. So I won’t
be able to play in London as much as I
would have liked. But, I’m sure I’ll en-
joy a pint or two.
Would you like to appear on the
West End?
YES! I would love to appear in a show
on the West End. However, I am a wife
and a mother (to a 4 lb. puppy). So I
can’t just pack my bags and commit to
a West End contract. Beyond the joy of
theatre there is life. My family and life
will always be my first priority. As the
character Fanny Brice says in Funny
Girl, “You can’t take an audience home
with you.”
Would you like to do more album
based work and who would be your
dream duet?
I would love to do more recording.
The beauty and the struggle of record-
ing, though, lies in the process. With
this place I knew, I was not only the
artist but also the executive producer.
I made sure every decision fell to me. It
was exhausting but a true labor of love.
So, that is the question I now ask my-
self. Do I have the energy, finances and
inspiration to produce another album?
It would really have to be a theme and
line-up of songs that filled me with
great passion. I am always thinking of
what’s next. As far as my “dream duet”,
I have many. I would love to sing with
Ms. Streisand. To share a song with
James Taylor would be the ultimate.
His voice, his vibe, his musicianship;

it would be heaven. And of course, I
always love singing with my husband,
Sebastian Arcelus.
You’ve starred in shows alongside
the likes of Hugh Jackman and Ali-
son Janney, do you ever get star-
struck? And who would you get star-
struck if you met them?
I was not star struck with Hugh or Al-
lison because they were so laid back,
welcoming and excited to get to work.
Don’t get me wrong, I always felt bless-
ed and extremely lucky to work along
side them. But you don’t want your
co-star to think they are going to be
working with... a fan rather than a peer.
They are actors. They love what they
do. And they are counting on their
fellow cast members to do their best
work in order to create with them.
If I was to become stage-struck, it
would be in the presence of Barbara
Streisand, Julie Andrews, and Carol
Burnett.
You’ve worked with some of the best
songwriters in the business, whose
work have you enjoyed performing
and is there anyone you would love
to work with?
Well, I can’t answer who’s music I’ve
enjoyed most. Every songs evokes a
different emotion, a different story and
you just can’t rank them in an order.
That’s the genius of art. It’s not black
and white, 1-2-3, right or wrong. I do
have several composers I would still
love to work with. Stephen Sondheim
tops my list, as well as John Kander. I
adore the music of Adam Guettel and
would find it a glorious challenge to
sing one of his scores. I guess that’s the
goal... to be inspired and challenged.
These 3 composers certainly do that
for me.
As the original Elphaba in the Wick-
ed workshops, how do you feel about
the show’s impact on the theatre
world?
I am sooo proud to have been a part of
WICKED’s initial workshops, the orig-
inal company, the first Nat’l tour and
the Broadway company. I’ve shared an
8 year relationship with Wicked and
I am truly honored. I knew from the
moment I read the first script that it
would be a remarkable piece of theatre.
The music was magical. The script was
powerful and clever. And the creative
team/production team had an amazing
pedigree. It all added up to equal great
success. I will forever have a deep con-
nection to the role of Elphaba.
What would your dream role be?
Fanny Brice in funny girl..
What has been the most rewarding
part you’ve played and why?
Every role brings great reward and
great heartache. As an artist, one in-
vests so much time, love, tears, hard
work in creating a role. You truly fall
in love with the character you been
bringing to “life”. I have learned so
much from each experience that it all
has lead me to be the performer I am
today. That’s the reward... that you
learn from each character, each chal-
lenge, each success and each flop.
Can you give us any clues about what
The beauty and
the struggle of
recording, though,
lies in the process.
you’re up to next?
They are a few irons in the fire but un-
til a contract is signed, it doesn’t exist.
