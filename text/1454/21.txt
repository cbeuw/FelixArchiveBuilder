Only three films have managed to win
the ‘big five’ Oscars - Direction, Leading
Actor, Leading Actress, Supporting Actor,
Supporting Actress and Best Picture. These
are It Happened One Night (1), One Flew
Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (2) and Silence of the
Lambs (3).
Three films also hold the record for the most
Oscars won by a single film. They are The
Return of the King (4), Titanic (5) and Ben Hur
(not pictured)
The Godfather (6) caused a lot of
controversy at the 1973 Academy
Awards. Marlon Brando declined
his Oscar by sending a Native
American actress instead to explain
his reasons, she turned out to be a
fraud. Nina Rota’s famous score was
quickly removed from nominations
after it was discovered the famous ‘Love
Theme’ was taken from an earlier film .
Not shy from controversy as well was
Slumdog Millionaire (7) which cleaned up
at the 2009 Oscars with an incredible eight
Oscars. However rumours of mistreatment of
the film’s slumdog child stars soon circulated.

The Big Losers
In all their infinite wisdom, the
Academy quite often make mistakes.
The following films were outrageously
denied the Oscars they certainly
deserved.
There Will be Blood (8) was a fantastic
film though it sadly won only one of
the nine Oscars it was nominated
for. Pyscho(9) didn’t receive a single
nomination even though it now
recognised as one of Hitchcock’s
greatest achievements.
Taxi Driver (10) is an acquired taste.
It’s my favourite film of all time but it
was a chilly day in Hell when Rocky
took the Oscar for Best Picture and
Director. It was a start of a run of bad
luck for director Scorsese, he didn’t get
recognised for Raging Bull or Goodfellas
either.
Yes, I had another rant against Forrest
Gump last week, but it did take away
the Oscars that rightfully belong to
The Shawshank Redemption (11). Seven
nominations and no wins, come on!
It’s a toss up between Miller’s Crossing
(12) and Fargo for the most impressive
Coen Brothers film. Indie cinema
wasn’t considered cool then and so the
Academy unforgivably overlooked it -
no nominations.
Like (11) The Thin Red Line (13) was
nominated for seven Oscars. It was a
strong field in 1999 but Shakespeare in
Love was hardly worthy of Best Picture.

The 82nd Academy Awards will be held
on March 7 2010 at the Kodak Theatre in
Hollywood but just what is all the hype about?
Film editor Ed Knock presents a little guide to
brush up on your Oscar knowledge.
Why are the Academy Awards called the Oscars?
No-one is really quite sure, one theory is that an Academy librarian named
Margaret Herrick said the statuette resembled her uncle Oscar and the
nickname stuck. The other theory is that Bette Davis named her stauette for
her 1935 win after her husband Oscar Nelson.
The shortest Oscar acceptence speech is from Alfred Hitchcock for his
honoury Oscar in 1967. The longest speech is by Olivia de Havilland who
went on for seven minutes thanking a record 27 people.
Greatest Oscar Moments
Charlie Chaplin returning briefly to America to collect his emotional
honorary Oscar. The native of Elephant & Castle had been hounded out of
the USA during the McCarthy era and eventually settled in Switzerland.
Louise Fletcher signing her acceptance speech to her deaf parents for Oscar
winning role in One Flew Over The Cuckoo’s Nest
When a streaker interrupted the 1974 Oscars, host David Niven quickly
remarked “Probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by
stripping off and showing his shortcomings”. Legend.
