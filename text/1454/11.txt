The pound may tumble if markets lose faith in British budget deficit plans.
Is the economy too complex for voters?
This week, James Lees discusses the extent to which the state of
the economy will effect the upcoming general election.
I
t’s the economy, stupid, read
the phrase from Bill Clinton’s
campaign in 1992. This meant
that what wins voters over is
the state of the economy above
almost all else, and in the upcoming
British general election Bill’s phrase
will remain just as true.
Over the next few months the main
debate will be over the scale and
speed of the needed cuts to the na-
tion's growing budget deficit.
Britain has just emerged from re-
cession, with the last reported figures
showing the country limping out of
the longest and deepest recession
since before WWII.
While the return to growth is cer-
tainly good news, the extent to which
the economy expanded in the 4th
quarter of 2009, a mere 0.1%, was
lower than the 0.4% that had been
predicted.
The government seized on this data
to proclaim their policies were work-
ing, and using the opportunity to
score some points against the Tories
who had not been supportive of the
government’s spending plans.
Where to go from here is dividing
the parties and other commentators
as well. Labour’s plan is more or less
much of the same, with more borrow-
ing, more spending and with a pledge
to cut the deficit by half over the next
few years.
This plan has been criticised by 20
economics experts in a letter to the
Sunday Times last weekend.
Their opinion is that the Treasury
has not set out a plan to cut the budg-
et deficit quickly enough. Without
a significant effort to cut the struc-
tural deficit, the build up of which
they concur was necessary during the
recession, now threatens to drag the
country back into recession and com-
pletely undermine the recovery.
Personally, I am less inclined to
agree with Labour than with the au-
thors of that letter, who include a
range of distinguished academics
and policy makers. It certainly seems
to have been the case that quantita-
tive easing and increased government
spending has helped the economy
recover.
For this Darling and Brown deserve
some credit, but Labour have not
been the amazing financial wizards
the Prime Minister is so enthusiastic
to tell us they have been.
Gordon Brown is likely to go down
in history as the man who claimed
that there would be “no more boom
and bust” in 1997.
He then proceeded to borrow large
amounts of money, promoted the de-
regulation of the banks and of course
sold more than half of the nation’s
gold reserves at an embarrassingly
bad time
This complete lack of financial un-

Argentina steps up
row over Falklands
Argentina has an-
nounced new controls
on shipping in its waters
near the Falklands after
protests over British oil
drilling plans fell on deaf
ears. Argentine Presi-
dent, Cristina Fernandez
has now signed a decree
which requires all vessels
passing through Argen-
tinian territorial waters
or travelling between the islands and Argentina to seek prior
permission. The Falkland Islands, a British overseas terri-
tory, are also claimed by the Argentine government. This
dispute climaxed in 1982 with the Argentine invasion of the
Falklands.
Conservative error on
pregnancy rates
The BNP scrapped its
whites-only member-
ship rule following
a vote held at their
general meeting. Nick
Griffin, leader of the
BNP stated that “we
recognise legal real-
ity, so we have done
it, and now, for one
thing, they can’t call us
racist anymore”. The right-wing party was forced to change
its membership rules following a threat of legal action from
the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which Mr Grif-
fin described as a “government funded, tax payer funded
quango”. The first non white member is likely to be 78 year
old Mr Singh.
BNP now accepts
non- white members
The Conservatives have
been criticised after claim-
ing that the pregnancy
rate for under 18s in the 10
poorest areas of England
was 54%. The actual figure
of 5.4% being significantly
smaller caused the other
parties to declare the To-
ries as out of touch with
modern society. While it
might seem more likely
that it was an unfortunate
error from misreading the
figures, other Conserva-
tive claims of a ‘Broken Britain’ don’t appear to hold much
water either.

derstanding meant that the gold was
sold at over £5bn less than it would be
worth today.
Of course it is easy to be knowl-
edgeable with hindsight, and it is far
easier to criticise than to come up
with your own plans. That said even
at the time of the gold sale it was seen
by commodities experts as a ridicu-
lous plan.
It would seem that Labour are no
longer competent enough to run the
country, if they ever were; so the
question arises of whether the Con-
servatives are. The Conservatives
have been pushing for government
spending to come down for a long
time, and they feel vindicated by the
conclusions of the letter.
Shadow Chancellor George Os-
borne has said, “Crucially, these
economic experts also say there is a
compelling case for starting in 2010
and that there should be independent
oversight of the forecasts - two argu-
ments we Conservatives have been
making with force for months now."
The agreement between the authors
and the Tories is not total. The Tories
are not ruling out tax rises, including
VAT, which many commentators fear
may push the fledgling economy back
into recession.
Mainstream ideas of how to sort
out the country are of course not
the only ones. The New Economics
Foundation, a think tank with social-
ist leanings, believes that the working
week should be cut to 21 hours.
The idea is that it would tackle 2
problems in 1: unemployment and
those who are overworked. Sadly
for the lazy this is unlikely to ever
happen.
Employers spend a large amount of
time and money on training people,
and training twice as many people is
likely to prove prohibitively expen-
sive in some industries, for exam-
ple medicine or nuclear submarine
captaining.
The deepest problem the economy
is likely to face is the general election
itself. The number of people who will
vote will massively outweigh those
who understand the economy.
The stumbling block could easily be
short term vote grabbing policies over
long term schemes to get the econo-
my back into shape and before long
the PIIGS (Portugal, Italy, Ireland,
Greece, Spain) could be the BIG-PIS
or BI-PIGS.
