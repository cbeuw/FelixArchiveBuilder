The Wonder of
Wonder in Numbers
Stevie Wonder to headline Glastonbury!
You don’t need sight to know that you’re at
Glastonbury, the sense of smell will suffice
Now you do
what they
told you?
W
hat is power? Ac-
cording to Tony
Montana, ‘In this
country, you gotta
make the money
first. Then when you get the money
you get the power’. This seems pretty
simple, but what defines power? The
way I see things, there’s an underesti-
mated power in music. Not in the con-
ventional way of being powerful, but
in an indirect way that can feed on the
subconscious of the mind and influ-
ence the actions of huge amounts of
people. Speaking in terms of decades,
a winter’s morning of 1960 hailed Elvis
Presley as number 1. The King of Rock
and Roll, Presley stood for the rebels,
the breakaways and the nonconform-
ists. This alone is a nice fact, but he
was shortly followed by The Beatles in
‘63 and their music of love and peace,
later progressing to number 1’s from
the Rolling Stones and The Kinks, all
of this music having themes in peace,
love, against war and anger - every-
thing the hippy movement stood for.
Coincidence? Definitely not, but what
influenced what?
This relationship of music and cul-
ture is true for many key points in his-
tory, music having influence over the
end of wars and political decisions, the
Woodstock Festival being one of the
most famous cases of this. Going back
to before records were around, tribes
and cultures across the globe had nu-
merous chants and songs for happen-
ings such as going to war. In some
cases, the music was even taken into
battle in the form of drummers. The
intention of this music was to build up
the anger, aggression and drive for the
warriors to kill and defeat their enemy.
To say this music had no influence on
their minds is clearly not true.
Music is something that should be
feared for its power over people, the
power it deserves. Take punk music as
an example: I may be slightly biased for
my love of punk, but I’m no anarchist.
A strange thing happens when I listen
to The Sex Pistols or The Clash; I feel
the energy of anarchy and the thoughts
of punk music to fuck the system. The
amount of passion put in when making
a recording of this type, in a way, leaks
out through the music and through os-
mosis can manifest itself in the listener.
If somebody has gone through the
pain and love of making a song, what-
ever the genre, I think it deserves to be
heard, which is why I listen to such a
range of music. The gangsters on the
streets relate to the music which com-
pletes them, which is why they may not
understand their wrongdoings. I’m not
saying that there should be restrictions
on music in any way, because for me
that would be a crime, but I am say-
ing that it’s an underestimated force.
Music has the power to inspire people.
Inspire people to love, to hate, to save
or even to kill; so, know that you’re lis-
tening to a powerful force and be sure
you don’t always do what they tell you.

T
he man, the wonder, Stev-
ie Wonder is still alive and
kicking, so much so that
he’s taken the headline
spot at this year’s Glaston-
bury Festival. I have to feel sorry for
Stevie when I think about him head-
lining Glastonbury. I know it’s hard to
feel sorry for anyone who’s successful
enough to play in front of 150,000 peo-
ple, but he won’t be seeing any of them
yet smelling all of them. Then again,
it’s an honour.
Stevie Wonder went blind just af-
ter birth in 1950 and has gone on to
become the iconic sound of soul and
funk across the world, winning count-
less awards including the Gershwin
Lifetime Achievement Award and the
highest number of Grammy awards for
a solo artist.
Not only is he such a musical phe-
nomenon, he is also currently an
activist for civil rights and in 2009
was named UN Messenger of Peace.
Barack Obama is quoted about his
musical heroes, “If I had one it would
have to be Stevie Wonder. When I was
just at the point where you start get-
ting involved in music, Stevie Wonder
had that run. Those are as brilliant a
set of five albums as we’ve ever seen”.
So Stevie will take front and centre
this June on the Pyramid Stage, with
U2 and Muse being the other two
headline acts. It’s set to blow your
mind.
If there’s anybody for a young musi-
cian to look up to, it would have to be
Stevie Wonder. His courage and drive
to carry on with his blindness, his
songs that stand for everything good
and just the fact that everything he
touches not only turns to gold, makes
you feel so damn good.

TINIE TEMPAH
PASS OUT
DL RECORDS
SINGLE
Highlights include the way he says
“Bonjour”, “Scunthorpe”, the satisfy-
ingly catchy hook and funny break
down towards the end. Just a tad hard
to relate to lyrically, although after lis-
tening, I totally want to quit uni and
become a rapper.
-Lily Le
Raw sounds and an emo touch, You Me
at Six are keeping it basic. Nothing out
of the ordinary but these blasting gui-
tar chords with limited riffs have got
some serious power with some catchy
vocals; I was surprisedly impressed.
-Luke Turner
LADY GAGA
TELEPHONE
INTERSCOPE
SINGLE
Yes, Gaga is back with her irritating
habit of getting a song stuck in your
head and this is no exception. With
Beyonce featuring alongside her, Gaga
tells us of her telephone and the calls
she recieves and makes, and we all can’t
wait to hear about them... Or not. Even
so, it will stick with you. -Luke Turner

ALBUM
The Automatic are coming back for a
second round and it was always going
to be hard. This album is full of crunch-
ing guitars and merry vocals. It is as
well-mixed as pancake batter on Pan-
cake Day and has smart staccato riffs.
It does however begin to sound all the
same towards the end. -Luke Turner
If you’re pretty French girls with guitars,
nobody gives a shit what you release,
because everyone in the world wants to
fuck you and you know it. So go ahead
and tell us how much of a bitch you are
and even patronise us by spelling it out.
Nous vous aimons. -Lily Le

SINGLE
Hype always gets backlash which I was
hoping to be part of for Goulding, but
her single turns out to be quite difficult
to hate. It’s basically a few minutes of
lots of beats, beeps and some electron-
ic shizz with some wonked-up vocals,
but simple things please simple minds.

ALBUM
A twenty-something young girl, with a
fender and the skills to rock out. This
single is fun-loving light rock with raw
guitar which has had the evil hand of
overproduction cast upon it. Tiffany
Page, I hope, will give us more gentle
rock this year. - Luke Turner

ALBUM
Butterfly Explosion are basically really
slow indie rock, so either slow The Big
Pink down a bit or speed up Snow Patrol
and you’ve got The Butterfly Explosion.
The album doesn’t move very much, it
sticks on the same not-very-interesting
sound all the way -Kadhim Shubber
Nothing good about this song. The
sound is a rip-off of “Just Dance” by
Lady Gaga, the lyrics are a rip-off of eve-
ry RnB song since Usher’s “You Make
Me Wanna” and the video is a rip-off
of Justin Timberlake’s “Like I Love You”.
Summary: shit. -Kadhim Shubber
Viv Albertine used to be the guitarist
for punk band The Slits. Which means
that her songs sound really good
(they’re not punk btw, they’re mellow
and poppy) but the lyrics are just
abysmal. If you’re someone who doesn’t
listen to the lyrics of a song then you’ll
enjoy this. - Kadhim Shubber
