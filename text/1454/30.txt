FRIDAY 19 FEBRUARY 2010
Yanni: “I don’t dwell in the past; I don’t wallow in old events and emotions. I don’t waste time on regret. No use going over and over the details of what already happened.”
Quote of the Week
Wordoku 1,454
Solution 1453
How to play:
Wordoku is identical to Sudoku; we’ve just replaced
numbers with letters. Complete the puzzle and then
send the whole grid to sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
You will not get credit for just the word alone. It’s not
an anagram.
Evil Wordoku is exactly the same... only harder... and
there’s a letter missing... that MAY be a duplicate -
just solve it like normal and insert the letter that you
believe makes the word. And worth double.

My week in
many words

A
nother week, and anoth-
er insightful trip into the
world of Charlie. Some of
the brighter individuals
amongst you may have by now real-
ised that I use this space to quietly
rant about the world and its inhabit-
ants. You would be correct, so if you
don’t like it I’ll get Kanye West to come
over there and give you a Taylor Swift
style beat down, whatever the f*ck that
is. Sounds like some sort of pre-1930s
Jazz movement. Ask Joe “King” Oliver
for further information if you are con-
cerned. Tell him I sent you.
Unfortunately I’ve been too busy to
have time to reach the levels of anger
your used to. I ran the Hyde Park Re-
lays, and like any self-respecting drink-
er would, I ran ludicrously slowly and
almost vomited at the end. However
the upside of all that pain is that all
the cross country girls are, as my good
friend Ben Hanson esq. would put it,
‘bang tidy.’ No, I don’t know either.
However I think he is pointing towards
the fact that all cross country girls ap-
pear to be rather pretty. This would be
the case. So if any of you are looking
to chase a few girls whilst remaining
within the law, then go find those uni-
versity level Paula Radcliffs. Best take a
bucket as she’ll probably try to shit on
you. If anyone else attended the HPR,
you could really see the correlation be-
tween times and size of person. At the
front, pushing out the 15 minute runs
you have the skinny tossers who you
really think should know better. The
runners get slower and fatter, until you
see a 120 kilo heavyweight boxer, com-
plete with Converse shoes, looking like
he has just wandered in by mistake.
What really is beginning to piss me
off to levels that are far beyond hu-
man comprehension (excluding Carol
Vorderman, because she is just fantas-
tic) is the state of the bloody Fulham
Road. Seriously what the f*ck is going
on there? To my knowledge they have
been digging up that road, without
break, for about three years now. Pre-
vious to coming to university I didn’t
know that there could be that much
pipe in the world. Apparently, I’m told
there is. Secondly, if the road it dug
up, and all the pipes are taken out for
replacement, what happens to the wa-
ter in them? It doesn’t bear thinking
about. I ramble.
mmmmmm.....
How to play:
Insert these numbers into the grid to on the next
page, from left to right and top to bottom, in the
unshaded cells (left by solving the ‘Nonogram’).
Then proceed as normal for a ‘Slitherlink’.
It’s quite simple, all numbered cells must be sur-
rounded with a corresponding number of edges.
There may only be one continuous line. Any
cells without a number can have any number of
edges.
Well done to David May who won last week’s
puzzle. Good job. Send your solutions to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

Wordpath 1,454
Slithergram 1,454
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORD -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW -> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS) would
be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to sudoku.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.
