Hailed as the hooligan of fashion, Mc-
Queen was rumoured to have sewn ‘I
am a c—t’ into the lining of the jacket
that was made for Prince Charles while
he worked at Gieves & Hawkes. The
reputation never subsided.
He let his imagination roam wild and
the world has since seen stuffed wild
animals, real howling wolves and wind
tunnels on his runways. In many ways
he has championed the fashion hall of
fame by creating the most memorable
fashion shows. Alexandra Shulman
compared going to a McQueen show as
‘the closest you can get to theatre while
still being a fashion show.’
During his Givenchy days, he sent
model Shalom Harlow in a white cotton
dress, puffed with a petticoat, down
the runway and spray-painted her using
two car robots.
As he graduated into his own label,
his shows ventured into a more con-
troversial and extravagant territory. He
moved a catwalk into a London swim-
ming lido; projected his runway in
writhing cockroaches; had rain poured
down on models on the runway; turned
a catwalk into a children’s playground
and recently a dumpster; replaced mod-
els with mannequins...
As his shows became more avant-
garde, so did his clothes. McQueen
said, “The show shouldn’t overshadow
the clothes and vice-versa.” His designs
courted controversy from day one. His
breakthrough show in 1996 – four years
after his graduation – he presented his
Bumster collection with low-rise jeans
that exposed the derriere of models,
creating a strange proportion and
adding a new meaning to ‘cleavage’.
This collection took more than £1m
worldwide. His clothes often juxtapose
ideas governing how style is normally
conceived. A skeleton as a stole on an
assymetrical dinner jacket. An antler
headgear contradicted by an airy laced
gown. Majestic Victorian inspired regal
gowns accessorised with ethnic style...
The list goes on.
McQueen presented his final wom-
enswear collection in Paris, entitled
Plato’s Atlantis. He was inspired by the
coral reefs he saw while he was scuba-
diving in Barbados. Models strutted in
12-inches Armadillo shoes – the never-
before seen shoe silhouette that resem-
bled the body of an armadillo. Mc-
Queen told the Spring/Summer issue
of Love that he doesn’t spend money
on advertisements in fashion maga-
zines. The cash flow is directed towards
revolutionising fashion shows instead –
which saw his last collection being live-
streamed on Nick Knight’s showstudio.
com. Millions of visitors flocked to the
site and overloaded it. ‘At the end of the
day, what people (critics) say doesn’t
matter anymore’ as his customers can
put a verdict on his clothes themselves.
His fans include Daphne Guiness,
Cate Blanchett, Sarah Jessica Parker,
Eva Green, Cheryl Cole and more...
rumoured she went as far as to phone
McQueen’s parents to arrange a meet-
ing between the two. McQueen’s suc-
cess could be in part attributed to Blow
as she used her status as a famous stylist
and a magazine editor to pull strings for
McQueen when he first started out.
McQueen had retained close ties
with his mother, Joyce, until her death
2 weeks ago. In 2004, Joyce interviewed
McQueen for G2, a supplement of the
Guardian newspaper. She asked him:
‘What is your most terrifying fear?’, to
which he replied: ‘Dying before you.’
She said: ‘Thank you, son.’ McQueen’s
AW10 collection entitled Horn of Plenty
was dedicated to her.
The death of his mother caused Mc-
Queen to spiral into depression, as his
final tweets seem to reveal. Two days
before his death on the 10th Feb he
tweeted, ‘Sunday evening been an F—-g
awful week but my friends have been
great, but now I have to some how pull
myself together and finish with the…’

Long Live the Queen – A Tribute to Lee McQueen
Calling McQueen a legend is definitely an understatement. Kawai Wong and Renny Norman recapped the life
of the super talented fashion visionary Lee McQueen, who passed away on the 11th Feburary, 2010.
Lee Alexander McQueen grew up in
East London, the son of a taxi driver
and one of six children of a family that
suffered many financial difficulties.
McQueen often made dresses for his
sisters.
He was openly gay and said that
he “went straight from [his] mother’s
womb onto the gay parade”, claiming
to have realised at age six. He came out
to his parents at age 18. He unofficially
married his lover, George Forsyth in
2000 on a yacht in Ibiza with Kate Moss
as his bridesmaid. The pair separated
soon afterwards. In the aftermath of
this he has been known to have had a
relationship with a porn star nicknamed
“Mr Stag” and an Australian who left
him to return to Australia.
McQueen’s close friend Isabella Blow
has been following McQueen’s career
since before he graduated from Cen-
tral St Martins. Failing to get a seat at
his graduate collection show she went
on to purchase his collection in full in
order to show her admiration. It was
McQueen left school at 16 with a sin-
gle O-Level in art and immediately be-
gan an apprenticeship with a tailor on
Savile Row. He then applied to work as
a pattern cutter tutor at CSM in 1994.
Due to the strength of his portfolio he
was persuaded by a professor to en-
rol in an MA course and graduated in
1992.
His graduate collection was bought
in its entirety for £5000 by the influ-
ential stylist Isabella Blow. The clothes
were delivered to her in refuse sacks.
She bought one thing a month from
McQueen when his career first started
and paid him £100 a week. The friend-
ship forged between the two remained
until Isabella took her own life in 2007,
after having been diagnosed with ovar-
ian cancer. The devastated designer
dedicated his SSO8 collection to her.
4 years after his graduation in 1996,
McQueenbecamethecreativedirector
at Givenchy, replacing John Galliano.
He stayed at the job until 2001 when
his contract ended, even though the
job was ‘constraining his creativity’.

McQueen created the eponymous
brand after his departure from Gi-
venchy. Isabella Blow convinced Mc-
Queen to use his middle name Alex-
ander for the label. The Gucci Group
acquired 51% of the company in 2000.
The greater degree of financial free-
dom allowed McQueen to become one
of the greatest fashion designers of his
generation.
McQueen also took the “British De-
signer of the Year” title from Galliano
in 1996, becoming the youngest de-
signer to have done so. He went on to
win the award three more times until
2003. He was also awarded a CBE for
contribution to fashion.
There is intense speculation regard-
ing the label’s future. Robert Polet,
Gucci Group CEO released a state-
ment: “The legacy he leaves us is a rich
one, and one that we will cherish and
honour.”
McQueen said in his final interview:
‘I want this to be a company that lives
way beyond me... when I’m dead,
hopefully this house will still be going.’
