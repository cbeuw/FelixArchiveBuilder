The Taming of the Shrew: It’s Shakespeare…but woke
T
he Royal
S h a k e s p e a r e
Company return
to the Barbican
this winter with As You
Like It, Measure for
Measure and The Taming
of the Shrew. Justin
Audibert’s electrifying
production of Shrew is
a gender-flipped version
of the original, where,
instead of a rich gentle-
man looking for suitors
for his daughters, a rich
gentlewoman, Baptista,
struggles to marry off
her sons. She insists that
her sharp-tongued, elder
son, Katherine be mar-
ried before the angelic,
younger son, Bianco.
This restriction is much
to the dismay of Bianco’s
numerous suitors, who
instead hatch their own
cunning plans to court
him in secret.
Every detail of this
production is impeccably
designed. The male
characters are given long
flowing locks that they flip
over their shoulders with
flirtatious ease as they
dance gracefully on stage.
The women’s gowns are
voluminous and richly
decorated in comparison
to the men’s, emphasising
that they hold the power.
Movement is also key
in demonstrating this.
The female actors make
bold eye contact, initiate
conversation and take
the men’s hands and kiss
them in greeting, asserting
dominance.
James Cooney bril-
liantly portrays the much
sought-after Bianco with
coy elegance. Katherine is
brought to life by Joseph
Arkley in a performance
that somewhat lacks the
feistiness expected of a
shrew in need of taming.
But these are just sup-
porting roles - the stage
is dominated by women.
Laura Elsworthy as
Trania, and Emily John-
stone as Lucentia have
a perfect smart-dumb
chemistry which will have
you laughing from the
opening scenes. Gremia
is portrayed by Sophie
Stanton hilariously. She
glides around stage on a
hoverboard and is inca-
pable of saying the object
of her desire’s name,
‘Bianco’, without giving
her sword a handjob.
My one criticism is that
the relationship between
Katherine and Petru-
chio, the gentlewoman
in pursuit of wealth
who dares to tame the
shrew, is unexpectedly
underwhelming. Despite
this being the main
storyline of the play, the
courtship of his brother
by the lustful Lucentia
is much more engaging.
Petruchio’s bold manner
and chaotic head of red,
curly hair are suggestive
of Elizabeth I, the second
female monarch and
famously thought of as
‘unfeminine’. Her char-
acter is often dressed in
men’s clothes, a detail I
found rather perplexing in
a gender-flipped play.
Although the switch
of gender roles has faced
criticism, I thought it was
expertly executed, main-
taining a healthy balance
between questioning
gender roles and comedic
effect. Seeing a mother
search for the highest
bidder for her son’s hand
is more shocking than
watching the traditional
patriarchal version.
Notably, the matriarchal
dynamic highlights the
key theme of the play:
power, which is often for-
gotten amidst the humour.
Although the play
maintains much of the
original prose, the staging
and acting has been
adapted amusingly for a
modern audience, proving
to be a treat for the eyes. ,
It did leave me somewhat
puzzled but I laughed
my arse off. Don’t be put
off by the fact that it’s
unconventional or that
it’s Shakespeare, and
get yourself over to the
Barbican to check out this
fabulous comedy.
I Love You, You’re Perfect, Now Change
L
ove is at the
centre of all good
tales. Every story
ever told, every
piece of art, is propelled
by this strange notion
of an attractive force
between individuals, a
force that can neither be
defined nor explained.
And yet that’s what I Love
You… attempts to do by
showcasing the almost
infinite permutations of
romantic love in the form
of minutes-long musical
sketches.
Through the lens of
humour and a heavy dose
of modern-day cynicism,
the vignettes range from
snapshots of first dates
to slice-of-life looks at
post-marriage hell. Given
the show’s original run
started in 1996, a lot
of work has gone into
making this production
feel glossy and current.
The show was substan-
tially rewritten in 2017
and now they have gay
couples, lesbian couples,
mentions of Grindr, a
popular gay dating app,
and even regional British
accents. It’s all very
relevant. Unfortunately,
the source material didn’t
quite have enough nuance
or depth to really translate
into the intricacies of
modern relationships.
Something rings false
in a song about rushing
through the first dates
sung by a couple who met
on Grindr (as anyone who
has used the app can attest,
the term “date” is always
used rather liberally in
the context of Grindr),
the lesbian mothers are
unfortunately reduced
to parodies of a straight
couple (although they
have enough awareness to
work that in as a joke), and
the dating video sketch is
just oddly anachronistic
given the rest of the show.
That’s not to say the
show isn’t funny. It’s
joyful in its ability to
make jokes about every
party in a relationship
and every scenario one
could imagine. Of the
compact four-person
cast, Laura Johnson
particularly stood out to
me, the blend of a brassy
voice and a wonderfully
malleable face making her
particularly impressive in
her comedic roles. George
Rae, Dominic Hodson,
and Naomi Slights are all
accomplished actors, able
to sell the illusion of a new
cast with a simple change
in costume, accent, or
affect.
The music is where
I felt the show was the
weakest. As mentioned
previously, updates were
made to the original songs
and the lyrical changes
not only helped ensure the
show didn’t feel dated, it
also brought the musical
a bit closer to home
geographically. However,
given the nature of the
show and the number of
scenes we were treated
to, no melody ever had
a chance to take up resi-
dence in your memory. A
musical with bad music
is one thing but a musical
with forgettable tunes?
That’s a tragedy.
Still, I recommend this
show as a piece of light
family entertainment or
even, dare I say it, a fun
date activity. Even though
it might not chart the spe-
cifics of your relationship,
more likely than not, one
of those sketches will
describe where your rela-
tionship is headed.
