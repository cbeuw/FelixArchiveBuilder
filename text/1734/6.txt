POLITICS

S
ome political sci-
entists argue that
the far right comes
in “waves”, and
that Europe is currently
being swept up by one
of them. Most European
countries have witnessed
the rise (and sometimes
fall) of parties represent-
ing this radical mindset in
the last century; but Spain
has been an exception,
or so it seemed. After the
Spanish general election
on the 10th of November,
Vox, Spain’s own far right
force, has established
itself as the third strongest
parliamentary force with
ﬁfty-two deputies out of
three hundred and ﬁfty.
This unexpected outcome
surely invites an analysis.
Now back to Vox - the
ﬁrst question that needs
answering is where they
come from. Vox was
founded by the more
conservative section
of the right wing party
Partido Popular (PP). This
excision was caused by
the disenchantment with
PP’s policies and cases
of corruption within the
party, and a belief that the
party had lost their ideals
to political correctness.
Many of their members,
therefore, already had
political careers in PP, but
what’s more interesting
is the section of the pop-
ulation they represent. PP
is a party whose political
history goes back to the
transition from the dic-
tatorship to democracy,
and was originally formed
by ex-members of the
Francoist regime. This
inheritance has dissolved
over the years within
the party’s structure, but
PP remains the party for
voters nostalgic of the
social conditions of late
Francoism. With their
origins understood, we
can now discuss its role in
the political landscape.
Vox’s discourse is
centred around these
main points: tradition-
alist ultra-nationalism,
territorial unity of Spain,
anti-immigration, and
euro-skeptic liberalism.
The main cohesive
element of their ideology
is an idea of patriotism
associated to pride in the
Spanish ﬂag and archaic,
Catholic traditions such
as bullﬁghting, the
monarchy, and religious
celebrations. These are
implied to be the virtuous
values of Spaniards; their
exaltation and defence are
the duties of any “patriot”.
This manipulation of
concepts allows them to
deﬁne “enemies of the
nation” just as easily, and
included in this category
are independence activists
and socially progressive
collectives. Their immi-
gration policies are based
on propaganda that immi-
grants take resources from
“patriots” and speeches
of terror against certain
groups such as Muslims.
They support a liberal
economy and tax reduc-
tions to both big and small
companies, but they take
a more interventionist
stance when it comes to
international commerce,
which is reinforced by
their euro-skepticism.
This skepticism, though,
is based less on disagree-
ment with the EU’s liberal
economy and more on
cultural values, immi-
gration policies, and the
secondary role they claim
Spain has in the EU.
The question of how
it became a force to
be reckoned with still
remains. As discussed,
the prevalence of neo-late
Francoist tolerance in

To give politico-historical context, we must
first discuss Franco’s dictatorship. In 1936, a small
group of Spanish generals led a rebellion against
the Republic of Spain. Support from Mussolini and
the Nazis to the generals led the rebellion to evolve
into national civil war, and due to an international
no intervention agreement to assist the Republic,
the rebels won the war in 1939. Immediately after,
a personalist dictatorship in the figure of Francisco
Franco was established.
Francoism (the ideology of Franco’s regime) can
be divided into two phases.The early phase of Fran-
coism was close to the Italian fascist ideology and
an interventionist autarchic economy: a self-suffi-
cient economy regulated by the State, refusing to
trade with external agents. During the fall of the
Axis powers, Francoism began to distance itself
from European fascism in order to survive, and
more change was caused by pressure placed on
the Spanish economy by post-war conditions and
the trade blocks imposed by European economies
due to the regime’s dictatorship. Late Francoism
was then developed in parallel with the Cold War,
when Spain was one of few remaining dictator-
ships in the Western world; this isolation gave it a
unique character.
Francoism exchanged their fascist values for
nationalist Catholic ones and started to transition
Spain into a liberal economy; their new ideology
represented a turn back to conservative monarchic
ideologies of the previous decades. With these
changes, and taking into consideration Spain’s
strategic geographic and military position in the
Cold War and the “anti-communist” nature of the
regime, Western forces (France, the UK, the US…)
tolerated late Francoism and allowed it to join the
Western bloc against the USSR. In the early 1970s,
Franco’s last years, he enacted a law to transition
Spain into a parliamentary monarchy after his
death. Western approval and the fact that Spanish
democracy was inherited from Franco himself has
resulted in the tolerance, to some extent, of Fran-
coism up to our days.
