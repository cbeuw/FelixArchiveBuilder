Immortals: Publicity Sec
A
fter the week
one game
against the
Falcons, the
game against Queen
Mary’s Vipers on Sunday
was the Immortals’second
chance to get a win this
season. As it was the day
before Remembrance
Day, both teams lined up
on the side-line and took
part in a minute of silence
to pay respects to all those
who gave their lives in
the World Wars, as well
as anyone else who’s life
was lost or impacted by
war.
Despite a shaky start
from the offence, the
defence managed to shut
out theVipers quickly with
little struggle. However,
disaster struck when one
of the Vipers’ defence
intercepted a pass by the
immortals and the Queen
Mary’s squad began to
quickly build momentum,
this led to them scoring a
touchdown. A few more
mistakes like this led to
the immortals conceding
several more touchdowns
and the half time score of
28-0.
At the half time the
team regrouped and
refocused, but the Queen
Mary’s Offensive line
were very strong and
well drilled and this gave
their Quarter Back time to
find their receivers and a
couple of missed tackles
led to the score being 48-0
when the final whistle was
blown.
In a game like this it is
easy to get disheartened,
however these players
fought to the very end. The
Game 2 MVPs are Punter
“Not Pres” Loughran,
Will “Beans” Woodward,
Grummers “Grummers”
Grummers, Crancisco
“His Mum didn’t come
and watch” Fosta and Finn
“Glee” Corney. As well as
the MVP’s a big congrat-
ulations to all the Rookies
who got to play for a lot
of snaps in the game in a
position that they may not
have trained at.
Despite the game result
being disappointing, there
are always positives and
negatives to take from any
loss, the positive being
that the team kept on
playing until the end. But
the negative being that
some of the plays where
the Immortals conceded
were due to mistakes from
lack of fundamentals and
hence there are things that
they must improve on in
training before their next
Game against Brunel at
Mother Harlington.
