relationship and presence
of ICU and the Constit-
uent Unions with the
students it represents (you
guys!) In fact, ‘identity’
has been a key ongoing
theme of the issues that
we at the CGCU have
been discussing recently.
A couple of weeks ago,
we received a sponsorship
offer for funding from
eToro to run an event
aimed at our members on
how to get started through
their platform. Although
it is simple in nature, the
CGCU committee have
been conflicted about it.
Sponsorship is a hard
topic for us in general as
a Constituent Union - it’s
helpful for providing
funding that allows us to
run our own events, but on
the other hand, as Salman,
VP of Clubs and Socs here
in CGCU, phrased nicely:
“one sponsor we take is
potentially one sponsor
taken away from a club or
society we represent”. Yet
in the case of eToro, their
main reason for sponsor-
ing is not to offer student
work opportunities but
rather to get more students
to use their service. This
directly benefits them
financially, so money is
not a problem for them.
This then led to a
discussion about the
values that we, as the
engineers’ student union,
wish to uphold. Do we
only consider engineer-
ing-based companies,
or should we encourage
our students to utilise
their skills elsewhere as
well? Does this constitute
potentially becoming a
$ellout to opportunities in
finance?
We also try to be con-
siderate of the Faculty of
Engineering and City &
Guilds College Associ-
ation and their views on
the decisions we make for
our engineering students.
They are generous sup-
porters for our events
(such as Welcome Dinner)
and help to subsidise
tickets for students, so
we don’t want to be en-
couraging students to turn
away from engineering
completely.
However, it can be
hard to be considerate of
all the stakeholders we
are involved with, when
many have conflicting
goals. We exist in a weird
system, where Constitu-
ent Student Unions act as
the intermediary between
ICU (which represents the
entire student body), the
relevant Imperial College
faculty, and the CSPs that
with you, the students,
and thus there is a need to
meet them eye-to-eye to
understand their problems
without disregarding their
worries and concerns as
an impartial computer
program might.
We ultimately did not
take the eToro sponsor-
ship offer for an event this
term, but we have been
focusing a lot on how we
market ourselves to stay
relevant in the lives of
normal students, even if
we don’t always get the
chance to directly interact
with them as much as we
would like. Our job, I feel,
isn’t to engage students
with the biggest events
weekly, but rather to rep-
resent their voices in the
face of obstacles with the
platform we have and, as
written high on the walls
in our office, “put students
first”.
On that note, swing by
the office in CAGB350 –
we’re happy to talk about
anything that may be
bothering you. My inbox
is also always open at
guilds.treasurer@ic.ac.
uk for any feedback,
comments, or queries, so
do let me know if you’ve
enjoyed my piece!
H
ey, Hilliam
here, solely
writing this
week’s column
– so it isn’t going to
devolve back into Tom’s
“bitch column” for this
week!
As Treasurer, I manage
the budgets for our events
but also overlook the
finances of the 17 Clubs,
Societies and Projects
(CSPs) CGCU represents
as a Management Group.
If you’re a member of
DoCSoc, ChemEngSoc,
BioEngSoc, AeroSoc,
DesEngSoc, Motor Club,
Data Science (ICDSS),
SpaceSoc, CivSoc,
EESoc, MechEngSoc,
Robotics (ICRS), Rugby
Club, RailSoc, DroneSoc,
Engineering Change,
or Racing Green, we
represent you. As you
can tell by the length of
that list, it’s a lot of work.
However, that’s enough
about me! Time for an
update on our activities.
It’s already the second
half of the Autumn term
and a lot has been going on
in the office. We’ve been
sorting out the logistics
of the ‘The Engineering
Company’ industry talk
we have on the 19th
next
Tuesday – the organisa-
tion of which is being
done in parallel with the
‘Faces of Engineering’
panel talk we’re hosting
on the 28th. Douglas, our
Events Officer, has really
taken a lot of initiative on
the panel talk in conjunc-
tion with ChemEngSoc,
BioEngSoc, EESoc, and
DoCSoc with speakers
from Google, Microsoft,
and P&G.
Fatima (CGCU VP)
and I also now sit on the
Governance & Identity
subcommittee of Union
Council along with Tom.
This is a very new com-
mittee that started just this
year, which evaluates the
values Imperial College
Union (ICU) wishes to
uphold , as well as the

“As written
on our office
walls, we
want to‘put
students first’”
we work with on a daily
basis. At the same time,
impartiality is something
that can cause us to
become disconnected
from the student volun-
teers in the CSPs we work
with that we could almost
put a computer program
in place, to sign off on
bar bookings for AeroSoc
or to chase up ICRS’
Harlington Fund applica-
tion for new 3D printers.
What we want to provide
is an irreplaceable sense
of empathy and embody
the same desires as our
student volunteers and
CSPs have, to be able to
run amazing events across
campus.
At the end of the day,
as a Constituent Union,
we do represent 17 engi-
neering-based societies
that we are lucky to have.
We are there for them
to ensure their issues
get resolved as soon as
possible, so that DoCSoc
can secure a room for
their next sponsored event
in a timely fashion, or that
DroneSoc can get back on
their feet after a dreadful
Welcome Fair placement
(please support them!)
Even as students with
hardcore degrees (JMC
students, represent), we
do focus on making sure
that our CSPs are support-
ed so that they can engage
