Donate your coats this Winter
The ultimate guide to student wellbeing
On behalf of Wrap Up London, the Union will be accepting unwanted
coats from student and staff to be redistributed to local charities and
community groups who directly offer support to people who are
homeless, refugees, older people, people fleeing domestic violence,
and those at risk through living in poverty.
For people facing crisis, the impact of receiving a coat can go further
than just keeping warm.The coats collected by Wrap Up London offer a
real opportunity for positive change.
Drop off your coats at the Union reception on Level 2 in the Beit Building,
South Kensington Campus by Friday 22 November.
