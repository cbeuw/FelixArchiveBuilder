SLITHERLINK
Connect horizontally and vertically adjacent dots
so that the lines form a simple loop with no loose
ends. The number inside a square represents how
many of its four sides are segments in the loop. SUDOKU
Fill all the boxes with a number be-
tween 1 and 9. A number can only ap-
pear once in a row/column, and only
once in each sub-box.
Hello, Puzzlers!Todayâ€™s been a tighter fit than usual, with Crossword
and Sudoku, and a return of an old favourite - SLITHERLINK. Keep
being wholesome, and get yourself a martini before you get on the
cryptogram! (Or after, or not, your call.) Weâ€™ve been having a few
issues with our spreadsheet, so there might be some rank-jumps.
Next week onwards, we will also be upping the difficulties - too
many people got a solid 24 last week! Keep your eyes peeled; the
editors have so much more planned to sustain you till Christmas.
