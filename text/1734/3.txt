College Plans to Put Path across Queen's Lawn
T
he College is
planning to
place a path
across the
Queen’s Lawn – a move
which has raised con-
troversy amongst some
students. The path will
run across the diagonal
of the lawn, based on
analysis of timelapse
photography showing
the most-used path by
pedestrians crossing.
The aim of the initi-
ative is to preserve the
grass on the lawn, which
often becomes severely
damaged in winter, and to
avoid the lawn becoming
a “mudbath” as the rainy
seasons approach.
Neil Alford, Associate
Provost (Academic Plan-
ning), elaborated about
the intent behind it: “We
want to avoid churning up
the Queen’s Lawn into a
mudbath, which happens
every winter! And at the
moment this particular
idea is in a pre-planning
application stage. There
is no guarantee it goes
ahead – though personal-
ly, I hope it will.”
The initiative is part
of the ‘South Kensington
Masterplan’, an archi-
tectural vision for the
campus published in De-
cember 2018 following
consultations with 550
members of the commu-
nity over preceding years.
The masterplan also fea-
tures projects that focus
on opening up space and
reducing congestion, such
as creating a new street
to align the Sherfield
Walkway, pedestrianising
a portion of Imperial
College Road, and es-
tablishing new pathways
between Queen’s Lawn
and Beit Quad as well
as between Dalby Court
and Prince Consort Road.
A donation towards the
College is paying for
some of the projects, with
the remit being to “beau-
tify the area around the
Queen’s Lawn.”
Neil says he further dis-
cussed the Queen’s Lawn
path with the Union Presi-
dent and Deputy President
(Clubs and Societies),
Abhijay Sood and Thomas
Fernandez-Debets, after
they took up office this
year. This resulted in the
matter being presented
at the CSPB meeting for
consultation on preferenc-
es for tiling, and at Union
Council.
Neil elaborated: “I
meet with Abhijay and
Tom once a month, and
that seemed a reasonable
way to get student feed-
back – which I’m really
keen on getting. I asked happen again, which is a
good thing. Last time it
happened, the grass just
vanished. We want to
preserve that part of the
Queen’s Lawn, and we’re
building the path in order
to preserve it further. It’s
certainly not a slippery
slope, and we’re not
planning to put any other
structure on the lawn at
all.”
The single area of
agreement seems to be
that a solution for the
quality of the lawn needs
to be found, given the
damage it has sustained in
past winters. As Alex put
it, “there is an issue with
the Queen’s Lawn state
during the winter months.
Honestly it looks like
s***.”
not been consulted. Alex
Auyang, the President of
the RCSU, commented:
“If they wanted student
perspectives, at least
consulting the Constituent
Unions would have been
helpful. We function on a
lower level than they do,
and I like to imagine that
we are more in touch with
the desires of the student
body.”
Additionally, both he
and multiple CGCU rep-
resentatives felt that the
plan was doomed to fail
– specifically, that a path
would be “ugly, not solve
the issue, and cut right
through a green space.”
Fatima Khan, CGCU Vice
President, clarified:
“Whether or not you put
in a path, people will take
shortcuts and walk across
the grass anyway, it will
get muddy regardless. It is
better to not put in the path
as people will take more
varied shortcuts across the
grass, meaning it will take
longer to get muddy in a
particular area. There are
other methods of deter-
ring people from walking
across Queen's Lawn. For
example, bushes – which
ironically they removed
recently.”
Alex also suggested
alternatives: “I think they
should consider other
options, such as a gravel
path. This way, the green
space of the Queen’s lawn
can be preserved and be
free from a path of gaudy
tiles.”
However, Chris Carter,
the RSMU President,
thought the opposite, and
believes that the path
will protect the lawn and
“increase the amount of
usable (and pleasant)
green space on campus in
the summer.”
There have also been
concerns raised about
the possibility of the
construction of the path
being a “slippery slope”
to further development
in the space – one of the
few green spaces in South
Kensington. Neil was
eager to dissuade this
notion:
“Definitely not! The
purpose is to prevent
the lawn being a real
mudbath. We’ve already
stopped putting marquees
on the lawn to use it for
graduation – that will not
