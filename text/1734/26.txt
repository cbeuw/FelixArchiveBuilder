The lowdown on BBC Introducing LIVE
For twelve years BBC
Introducing has been
helping upcoming artists
break into the industry.
Every year the BBC holds
an event (BBC Intro-
ducing LIVE), a relative
candy shop for musicians
to get insider informa-
tion from the insiders
themselves. Alumni of
the service include Little
Simz, Ed Sheeran, and
George Ezra, insanely
successful now but each
had their humble begin-
nings with the BBC.
For three gloomy
days at the east London
Tobacco Docks a couple
Felix music editors
pottered about like
imposters. The event
boasted a wide selection
of lectures, seminars
and workshops. Some
of the biggest keynote
speakers were Catfish and
the Bottlemen and the
ever-elusive Jake Bugg.
Despite being some of the
biggest names in music
they didn’t have a lot of
specific tip and tricks to
share. It was more just in-
teresting to hear them tell
anecdotes of the journey
they took to stardom. The
ones who truly knew what
they were talking about
were the stars behind the
shows. Talks on social
media management, col-
lecting a fanbase and how
to tour on little money
were always packed.
Abbey Road techni-
cians gave seminars on
new tech popping up in
the industry like cloud
editing music software
(basically google docs for
musicians) and adaptive
music platforms that
provide a more interactive
experience with sound.
MelodyVR members
spoke about the place of
VR in the music industry
and how the tech may end
up helping you get closer
to the artists you love.
One of the scariest
things we heard was that
TicTok and Triller are
the future of the music
industry, and that pop
music may be taken over
by adaptive AI music plat-
forms. The experts may
be right, but I’d prefer it if
they weren’t.
Showrooms were
set-up all over the place by
companies like Marshall,
Spotify, Shure, Yamaha,
etc. They displayed all
their latest tech giving
musicians the much
needed option of trying
before buying. On top of
that workshops were held
by mixing and mastering
veterans helping produc-
ers take their work to the
next level or work through
problems they had been
facing.
Whatever the role
(musician, manager,
producer, journalist)
there was something to
be gained from the event.
Even if you didn’t go to
learn you could still see
the live music acts dotted
around the venue with
artists like Easy Life,
Celeste and Lily Moore.
Any Imperialites out there
considering a side venture
in the music industry, I
highly recommend you
make it to Introducing
LIVE 2020.
Denis Sulta takes us to the Xanadu of dance
We turn the corner,
the gray lake at Canada
Water still at the back of
our minds. It’s pouring it
down, and the group con-
sensus is that we won’t
miss the outside world for
the next 10 hours. We’re
going into the void. That
is how every new Print-
works adventure feels.
I’m not explicitly
blaming TfL for missing
Virginia’s solo set.
Actually, I am. So first up
is Ryan Elliot, who wears
a turtleneck-ish sweater
and a long camel coat.
Suave. Only a few of us
groove on the 2 pm dance-
floor - a fact foreshadowed
by the lack of hysterical
queueing for security.
Some guys solicit the
illicit from me. It means
my outfit is on point. The
Detroit-cum-Berliner’s
beats grab my feet. In
some ways this is the best
part of the party. The floor
is empty. It is ours.
Following Mr. Elliot
is Éclair Fifi, whose coat
game is nonexistent, but
excels in every other
way. Starting with some
incredibly pungent
basslines, she slowly reels
us in with her unorthodox
beats. When you expect
a break, she leaves you
hanging; when you least
expected it, she grabs you
by the collar. Techno that
keeps you guessing makes
for some very enjoyable
dancing.
Having missed out on
Virginia alone, we got to
see her in action B2B with
Mr. curator himself, Denis
Sulta, in the dark room
tucked away at the back of
the behemoths that are the
press halls. The overarch-
ing sensation in the over-
flowing low-ceilinged
room is dankness. Green
neon lights, air saturated
with sweat, marauding
4x4: what a treat!
We had to duck out
quite quickly as the big
guns began to roll out in
the proverbial hull of the
battle ship of the press
halls. Todd Terje was the
perfect appetizer. Piano
riffs that could resurrect
a pagan, morphing into
synths that then carry him
into heaven. He played
Whitney’s I Wanna Dance
With Somebody but
avoided his own bangers
– alas no Inspector Norse.
What followed was
constant commuting
between Serbian queen
Tijana T dropping bombs
in her mini skirt and high
heels (Balkans represent!)
in the big hall and techno
prodigy Leo Pol killing
it in the little cave at the
back. Having seen him
at a fairly lighthearted
house set the day before
at Mixmag’s Lab, I was
completely enamoured.
Definitely one to watch.
Finally, the highlights
of the night. Main course
number one being Gerd
Jansen. The Gentleman
of House did not live up
to his name. He was an
absolute naughty boy,
causing a ruckus on the
dancefloor, with dancers
in drag spicing things up
on platforms both sides
of the aisle. It was sump-
tuous mixing and, as with
his MAGICAL Sugar
Mountain set, he managed
to squeeze in KK’s
Neutron Dance (even if
just the bass). The lights
also deserve a shoutout.
It was at this point that
the pulley system holding
them up went wild, giving
us the impression that
we’re all speeding down
an airport runway.
And take off we did.
Denis brought it all. Dis-
regarding all conventions,
he opened with Queens
of the Stone Age’s You
Think I Ain’t Worth a
Dollar, and carried the
screaming vibe into some
of the best techno I’ve
heard in a while. After
spinning a few of his
own tracks and giving
a heartfelt little speech
about the importance of
club culture, he shocked
everyone by ending with
a little medley of nough-
ties bangers, including
Dizzee Rascal and Fergie.
His confidence was
astounding, even if the
music selection was a bit
unforeseen. He can’t be
shackled, and it seems as
though his star will only
keep on rising.
