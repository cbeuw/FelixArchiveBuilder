Greenwashing – are you falling victim?
E
fforts to decrease
the environmen-
tal impact of our
consumer culture
are being prevented by
confusion over termi-
nology and outrageous
greenwashing. In a world
where ‘sustainability’ is
all the rage, you might be
drawn to the chocolate
bar with a small green
leaf on it, making promis-
es of ‘sustainably sourced
cocoa’ and ‘ethical
farming’. By picking this
bar over another brand
which lacks these labels,
you might be falling to
the traps of greenwash-
ing. So how do we know
who to trust?
What is greenwash-
ing
You’ve probably heard
of whitewashing, which
is the practice of covering
up scandalous stories by
presenting a biased view
of the facts. The less
well-known term ‘green-
washing’ was coined
by environmentalist Jay
Westerveld in 1986 and
describes the corporate
practice of making
misleading or deceptive
claims about the sustain-
ability of products, goals
or policies. This ranges
from simply changing
the name/packaging of a
product to ridiculously
expensive marketing cam-
paigns. Many greenwash-
ing practices are almost
impossible to spot and
only come to light when
the company’s spending
differences are analysed
more closely. In many
cases, more money/time
is spent on advertising
the idea of being environ-
mentally conscious than
actually spent on ethical
and sustainable practices.
Origins and examples
of greenwashing
In the mid-1980s,
consumers received the
majority of their informa-
tion about products from
television, radio and print
media. Without the current
luxury of the Internet
to check facts within
seconds, companies were
able to mislead people to
believe in their alleged
sustainable practices. The
most notable example is
‘The People Do’campaign
ran by Chevron, a big oil
company. In the 1980s,
The company made com-
mercials centred around
how ‘environmentally
friendly’ their business
was, while simultaneously
violating the Clean Water
Act, the Clean Air act and
also causing damaging
wildlife with massive oil
spills.
Another classic green-
washing case is that of
Volkswagen. By fitting
their vehicles with a
device which could detect
when it was undergoing
an emissions test, the
company was able to
cheat these results by
temporarily altering the
car’s performance. At the
same time, the company

filled their marketing
campaigns with claims
of low-emission engines,
which in reality produced
40 times more pollutants
than consumers were led
to believe.
Greenwashing has
changed dramatically
over the last few decades
and the usage of the
term didn’t take off until
recently, which coin-
cided with the increase
in demand for greener
practices. As a result of
the growing awareness of
greenwashing, the sale of
any plastics labelled and
marketed as ‘biodegrad-
able’ or ‘compostable’
are banned in California.
It was recognised that
these claims were often
highly misleading or
simply wrong, especially
with regards to how
quickly the product will
biodegrade. Consumers
would buy these plastics
thinking that they were
the better option, envi-
ronmentally-speaking,
when in fact there was no
difference. In early 2017,
Walmart paid a penalty of
almost $1 million to settle
allegations accusing the
corporation of violating
this exact law.
Why should you care
about greenwashing?
Greenwashing is the
enemy of sustainability
and is hiding a much
larger problem. On the
surface, it is a marketing
ploy designed to trick
consumers into buying
a given product. This
may lead to consumer
scepticism of all green
claims, which diminishes
the power of sustainable
and ethical companies.
At its core, greenwashing
incentivises something
that many be harming the
environment.
Brainwashing or green-
washing? How to avoid
the common pitfalls
As sustainability and
green practices continue
to grow in popularity,
so does the use of terms
such as ‘eco-friendly’,
‘compostable’, ‘ethical’
and ‘biodegradable’. The
problem with those terms
is that many are not well
understood by the public,
and it allows brands to
be ambiguous about their
environmental commit-
ments, hence allowing for
easy greenwashing.
Here are some tips for
how to avoid being green-
washed:
1. Do you see an
amazing ‘green’ claim
Greenwashing
has changed
dramatically
over the last
few decades
and the usage
of the term
didn’t take off
until recently,
that seems too good to
be true? Double check it
on their website to see if
they are overstating their
intentions.
2. Do you see sugges-
tive pictures? Images such
as beautiful nature scenes
and use of the colour
green will lead you to
believe that the product is
nature, even if this is not
the case.
3. How transparent
is the company? When
you check their website,
you’re should see a lot of
information, instead of the
usual vague and unspecif-
ic descriptions that are
common in greenwashing.
4. Does the ad use
misleading buzz words
that doesn’t have any real
meaning? Throwing in
words like ‘eco-friendly’
or ‘green’ without any
certifications, third party
endorsement or real facts
suggest that these claims
are unlikely to be true.
5. What is your
instinct? We all know that
advertising and marketing
should never be taken
at face value and we are
very good at recognising
when there is something
off about it.
Conclusion
Despite the abun-
dance of greenwashing
practices, there is hope.
Companies are practicing
greenwashing due to the
pressure the public is
putting on them, which is
already a step in the right
direction. By reading
the labels, doing a bit of
research and spreading
awareness, it’s definitely
possible to avoid most
greenwashing and make
progress in eliminating it
for good.
