O
ne of the prin-
ciple aims of
the CU section
is to inform
the student body of our
everyday operations, and
if I’m being honest, our
previous articles haven’t
really addressed that. So,
I thought I’d give it a go
this week.
Due to the opaque
nature of the Union,
particularly when viewed
from the outside, you
probably don’t know
much about the internal
organization of the RCSU.
The RCSU has several
subcommittees, each of
which is chaired by an
executive committee
member. The subcommit-
tee names are self-explan-
atory, so here is a quick
rundown of what each of
them has been up to for
the past week or so.
Activities:
One of the RCSU’s
chronic issues is a lack of
events during term time.
During freshers’ fortnight,
we had at least one event
a week, sometimes two.
Usually, the RCSU
doesn’t run many small
events past those two
weeks.
We think that this lack
of events hurts student en-
gagement, so we’re organ-
ising a few more to keep
people involved during
term time. The RCSU is
hosting a pub quiz, likely
in h-bar, and a Christmas
movie marathon fairly
soon. Stay tuned on our
social media for details.
Looking forward to seeing
you there!
Operations:
The operations com-
mittee has been focusing
on organising the science
challenge and updating
our sponsorship agree-
ments.
The science challenge
is our annual science com-
munication essay compe-
tition. The launch event
is this month, so we are
finalising the guest judges.
More information can be
found on the science chal-
lenge website, or from our
science challenge chair,
Isabelle Zhang, who can
be contacted at science.
challenge@imperial.
ac.uk.
Our new sponsorship
officer, Aishwarya Chi-
dambaram, has lent her
MathSoc expertise to our
own sponsorship agree-
ments. The RCSU used to
have lots of sponsors, and
believe it or not, taught
DocSoc how to manage
theirs back in the day!
Despite this, we haven’t
had any for the past few
years. We believe that, by
acquiring more funding
through sponsorship, we
can serve the student body
more effectively.
Education:
We had the ‘Meet your
reps’ event last week,
introducing our new
year and dep reps to the
student body. Hopefully
you dropped by to have a
chat with them, and if not,
at least looked up their
names. It’s always good
to know who you can turn
to if your department tries
to pull some shit – sorry,
I mean if there is ‘some
staff-student conflict
about a particular issue’.
Welfare:
Aside from the usual
business of operating the
welfare representation
network, we have been
trying to organise free
emergency feminine
hygiene products for
RCSU members. We feel
that this is an essential
welfare initiative, one that
has already recently been
rolled out to universities
in Scotland and in hospi-
tals in England. Internally,
there has been a bit of
debate about the best way
to distribute them, but the
prevailing idea is that we
will find discreet locations
in each department to
keep a small stash. Pay
attention to your depart-
mental welfare represent-
atives for updates on this
initiative!
Clubs & Societies:
The RCSU, in addition
to its own functions, also
acts as a management
group for the departmen-
tal societies (depsocs)
of the Faculty of Natural
Sciences. We oversee their
budgets and spending,
in addition to providing
support for their activities.
A few of our depsocs
have had issues getting
contracts and payments
approved by ICU for their
Christmas dinners. There
is basically only one
person who can approve
these sorts of requests:
Fifi Henry, the Deputy
President (Finance &
Services) for ICU. Given
her absence last week,
there was almost nobody
in ICU that could sort
it out – which is not an
acceptable state of affairs.
However, after about five
hours of pulling strings on
Friday afternoon, along
with the PhySoc and
MathSoc Presidents, we
got everything approved
and ready to go.
This blatant inefficien-
cy indicates a clear need
for reform regarding the
way ICU processes the
finances of its clubs and
societies. I’ve heard a
similar sentiment echoed
by Union President,
Abhijay Sood. We hope/
expect that he takes action
to improve this system.
If you have any
questions or comments
on anything we’ve been
doing, feel free to get in

If you enjoy these more
informative articles and
would like to see more
of them in future, or have
anything else you would
like addressed, please let
me know.
Thanks for reading –
and have a great week!
