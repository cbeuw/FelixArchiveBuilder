T
his Sunday,
Spain faced its
second general
election of the
year, the country seeking
a new government after
President Pedro Sánchez
failed to build a coalition
after the last election in
April.
At ﬁrst glance, it
seems that not much
about Spanish politics has
changed. Once more, the
Socialist Workers’ Party
(PSOE) won by a plural-
ity – this time with 120
deputies (the equivalent
to an MP in the UK), only
4 less than they had six
months ago; the conserv-
ative People’s Party (PP)
were in second place with
89 seats, recovering much
of the deputies they had
lost in April, which had
been their worst result in
their 30 years of history;
and neither the progressist
block nor the conserv-
ative one managed to
gain enough seats to
control Congress. This is
seemingly just like where
Spain found itself half a
year ago.
However, several
important factors have
indeed changed. Now, the
progressist parties have
shown an intent to reach
a coalition agreement for
the next legislature. The
main obstacle following
the last elections, which
was the refusal of PSOE
to form a coalition gov-
ernment with Podemos
(UP), the far-left party,
was overcome less than
48 hours after the elec-
tion’s results were known
and a deal was signed
off on Tuesday morning.
of forming a new gov-
ernment are even smaller
than what they were in
April. Both parties in
total hold only 155 seats,
10 less than their sum in
April, and far from the
176 deputies needed for an
absolute majority. To form
a proper government, they
must not only persuade
other minor parties to
join their coalition, but
they will also need seces-
sionist parties to abstain
from turning down the
investiture session, where
in order to become Pres-
ident, Sánchez will need
at least more afﬁrmative
votes than negative ones
from the Congress.
As was shown in last
week’s Felix article about
the Spanish political
atmosphere (which I
strongly recommend
reading), other parties
were in the running for
the presidency of the
government, having quite
different results between
each other.
Extreme-right party
Vox had a meteoric rise.
They entered Parliament
only in April, but are
“Sánchez
and Iglesias
sealed a deal
for the next
legislature, the
same deal they
previously
refused to sign
since the April
elections”

This accord would place
Pablo Iglesias, the leader
of Podemos, as the next
vice-president, something
which was speciﬁcally
banned by Mr. Sánchez
in the past. The reason
for this sudden change
may be that none of these
parties desire a third
general election, especial-
ly with the rising power of
far-right party Vox, who
won 28 new deputies this
Sunday.
Nevertheless, even with
this coalition, the chances

already the third biggest
party with 52 deputies
and 15% of the vote.
Their rhetoric against
immigrants and against
the Spanish State of au-
tonomous communities,
which are strongly de-
centralised, has resonated
strongly with part of the
population, especially
past Ciudadanos and PP
voters.
Especially remarkable
is the situation of Ciu-
dadanos, the formerly
centrist party that has
become increasingly right
wing in the last two years.
Their shift to the right had
led to their best election
ever in April, when they
became the third biggest
force in the Congress
with 57 seats. They even
had the chance to form a
stable government with
the PSOE, but due to
their decreasing support
of left wing ideals, they
chose to reject this option,
something which not all
the voters agreed with.
Last Sunday, they were
outcompeted by the other
conservative parties and
lost 47 of their deputies.
resigned and abandoned
the political realm.
Separatist parties in
Catalonia, on the other
hand, improved their
results and won 23
deputies, though this still
represents less than the
half of total seats in the
region.
Overall, abstention of
the public has also played
an important role in these
elections. Voter turnout
decreased by six points to
only 69.9% of the voting
population. This might
be a sign of the people’s
resignation from constant
political instability, es-
pecially among the left,
where much remorse
is felt about the missed
chance for a stable left-
wing coalition. However,

party that surged from this
disconformity and aimed

the defence of Spanish
unity, and declared even
tougher measures against

results, and on Monday

One more reason for

Catalan context. The party
