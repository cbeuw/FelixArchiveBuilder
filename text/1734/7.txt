society made it so that
Vox did not have to intro-
duce their ideas as new
or original, because they
were already present, but
just did not have a party
that represented these
views. Vox presented
itself as the party that
would give a voice to
these ideas. But the fact
that its discourse was
normalised and already
appealed to a small sector
“Early media

of society is not all that
explains their rise. The
catalyst for Vox’s success
was media coverage: even
before they had parlia-
mentary representation,
Vox was depicted by the
media as a political force
to watch. This exposure
allowed party members
to preach their speech of
terror, and in many cases
allowed them to fabricate
fear about issues that were
not previously regarded
as worrying. Examples
of this are their concerns
for mass illegal immi-
gration and the cultural
adaptation capacity of
legal immigrants, or their
support of legalising use
of weapons for household
defence. As they were the
ones bringing these topics
into political discourse,
they were also the only
ones offering solutions to
them, convincing citizens
to vote for them. After
elections on the 28th
of April, Vox became a
parliamentary force with
twenty-four seats. With
the prospect of a left
coalition government, it
was believed that those
elections would be the
peak of the far right wave
of these votes are from
the centre-right party, Ci-
udadanos, who lost most
These characteristics usually
classify Vox as a far right party, but
are claims of them being fascist rea-
sonable? Broadly, the historical evo-
lution of the word fascism suggests
that it designates ideologies that
preach mythical values (ethnicity,
nationality, family line…) that make
those possessing them intrinsically
superior to those who do not. These
mythical fetishes are then adapted
to the political system (western
democracy) in order to acquire po-
litical power. In this sense it could be
argued that Vox’s idea of patriotism
serves this role, making it a fascist
party in the modern sense.
More importantly, though, Vox’s
ideology is the modern heritage of
late Francoism. Francoism, tolerated
by Europe, survived in many Spanish
households and adapted to our
current democracy, whilst neo-late
Francoism also made its way through
the years in PP and culminated in the
creation of Vox. This explains their
traditional values over classic histor-
ical fascism. As Vox remains a direct
descendant of the nostalgia for
dictator Franco, a better description
of Vox than fascism would perhaps
be neo-late Francosim.
Is Vox facist?
of their political presence
because of their ideolog-
ical indecisiveness. The
difference between these
two parties is considera-
ble, but many voters who
hold anti-PP attitudes,
because of the party’s
internal corruption cases,
no longer saw an alterna-
tive in Ciudadanos and
joined Vox instead. Lastly,
the revival of the Catalo-
nian issue just before the
elections, made many
voters who do not want
to see an independent
Catalonia turn their head
to Vox, as they support
the strongest measures
against independence.
In conclusion, Vox, a
heritage party of Franco’s
dictatorship, was formed
out of the normalisation
of Francoism and has
in Spain; but no such
government was formed,
and second elections were
convoked.
Vox, with newfound
parliamentary presence
and a deﬁnite seat on the
debate table, was gaining
even more media time
afterApril. Vox’s speech is
characterised by a direct,
down to earth style, which
gives the public a sense
of certainty and security
that is often valued by the
Spanish electorate. As a
means to diminish their
importance, other parties
had attempted to ignore
them and avoided directly
challenging their views,
hoping to present an
attractive false impression
of their own strength.
But in the past
November elections, as
potential voters realised
that Vox had become a
well established party in
parliament with enough
representation to push
forward their changes in
practice, some indecisive
PP advocates decided
to join the far right for-
mation this time round.
They gained the seats of
28 more deputies to win a
total of 52. A large source

Europe.
