“Many
different side-
plots occur
throughout
the game as
you progress
and meet
different
people and
communities.“
S
o, this is where
it all began. In
1997 Interplay
E n t e r t a i n m e n t
released Fallout: A Post
Nuclear Roleplaying
Game. Even though this
is the first official Fallout
game, it was originally
developed as a sequel to
1988’s Wasteland. After
Interplay lost the rights to
Wasteland, Fallout took
on its own identity with
a unique backstory and a
grim sense of humour.
This was the first game
to be produced by Inter-
play using the G.U.R.P.S
role-playing system
(originally developed
in 1986) which heavily
featured turn-based battle
system aiming to unify the
“rules” of RPGs. Maga-
zines at the time of release
such as NEXT Genera-
tion compared Fallout to
other turn-based games,
such as X-COM, while
stating that:
Fallout’s individual
pieces have “The poten-
tial to change the face
of computer roleplaying
forever”.
And so it did.
Becoming an instant
classic, many fans still
consider it the best Fallout
game despite being
so far from where the
franchise is today. Why
is this? Well-read on and
you might just find out.
Story
The game is set in a
post-apocalyptic America
(Southern California to be
exact). After worldwide
conflict over petroleum
has caused China to
invade Alaska, China and
America go to war. In
the year 2077, a global
nuclear war occurs wiping
out most major cities in
a matter of hours. Those
who survive do so in un-
derground vaults designed
by a company called
Vault-Tec.
The protagonist, known
as the Vault Dweller lives
in one of these vaults
(Vault 13) in 2161, 84
years after the war.
The game begins
having the leader of Vault
13 (The Overseer) send
the Vault Dweller on a
mission to find a water
chip. A piece of technol-
ogy that allows for clean
water throughout the
vault. From then on, the
player has 150 in-game
days to retrieve this chip
from the outside world or
the game is lost.
Many different side-
plots occur throughout
the game as you progress
and meet different people
and communities of the
wasteland. One thing I
loved about Fallout was
the ability to choose what
way I wanted the story to
go. If I wanted to be evil
and kill everyone in my
path to find the chip, I
could.
Alternatively, I could
just as easily have talked
my way through most
interactions in the game
and get the same result.
The story, while being
amazing and full of unex-
pected turns, really shines
on replaying the game
thanks to the immense
amount of player choice
available through the
customisation of your
character which affects
the gameplay in many,
many ways.
Gameplay
The gameplay of
Fallout seems simple at
first but gets a lot of its
depth from the variety of
ways one can complete
a task. The general
gameplay loop involves
the player controlling the
vault dweller in real-time
from a top-down perspec-
tive. The character can
move in six directions
as it utilises a hexagonal
grid layout. Once you
enter combat it becomes a
turn-based game, in which
the player uses action
points (AP) to control
what their character can
do in that turn, whether
it be moving, using the
inventory, or shooting a
weapon.
I found the combat to
be an interesting system,
which sadly grew dry with
time.
You choose your stats,
known as S.P.E.C.I.A.L
at the start of the game,
and although these can be
upgraded through various
means, it is not something
easily done. I picked a
low agility stat initially
which meant my action
points were so low that
every fight just involved
me shooting a gun or
punching something
once, then waiting and
repeating this every turn
until I either killed the
enemy or healed. You do
have access to the V.A.T.
system, a form of aiming
that allows you to target
certain body parts for in-
creased AP cost, however,
if every time I am just
aiming for the head or the
groin, it quickly loses its
intrigue and just becomes
1 more thing I must fix
to my muscle memory in
order to complete turns
ASAP.
The combat does
become more interesting
throughout the game when
you gain different NPCs
as companions, but the
lack of ability to control
these companions made
me feel as though I had
less and less input over
the outcome of a fight.
However, the reason I
would still say Fallout’s
gameplay is fantastic is
that you are not required
to always go into combat
to achieve a goal. For
example, early on in the
game, you can encounter a
group of raiders who have
stolen a village chief’s
daughter. On my first play-
through, I attempted to
kill all the raiders to save
the daughter. This proved
very difficult and so I
increased my charisma on
the next playthrough, and
this time simply walked
into the camp and had the
option to convince the
raiders into letting her go.
There are many more
examples of this, not
just through speech but
through the use of a
plethora of unique skills
from lock-picking to
engineering. Every task
has a handful of ways to
complete it and there is
nothing more satisfying
than figuring out a way
around something which
