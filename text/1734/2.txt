The Eternal Problem
here is an insid-
ious problem
facing students
at Imperial - one
that very few of us are
able to notice.
Now that I write my
opening sentence out,
I realise it could easily
apply to any number of
things. That's just vague. I
feel dirty, like I've written
some sort of horrific click-
baity thing for Buzzfeed.
The issue is as simple
and eternal a fact of
student life (for most of
us, anyway) as lectures,
exams, sleepless nights,
or Memeperial posts:
we're only here for a few
years.
I know, shocking reve-
lation.
However, despite
the obviousness of the
statement, it has serious
ramifications across a
variety of issues in the
College community. It is,
once again, one of those
things that just pops up in
every conversation I have.
This week, it came up
when speaking to Neil
Alford about the proposed
path across the Queen's
Lawn. Initially, several
student representatives'
reactions were of frustra-
tion - they felt they had not
been consulted, and that
'once again' the College
was acting without speak-
ing to students.
In fact, in this case,
the College did consult
students. It's just that the
students they spoke to
have, statistically, proba-
bly mostly graduated.
(Three adverbs in a
row. Yikes. I'm washed
up already.)
Consultations were
run in the couple of years
preceding the announce-
ment of the masterplan in
December 2018. As over
500 people were involved,
they appear to have been
somewhat extensive. But
someone consulted in
2016 has graduated by
now if they were anything
but a fresher or a second
year on a four-year course.
The current generation
of students, and, essen-
tially, their democratical-
ly-elected representatives,
were never involved.
Not only does this
mean decisions are almost
never implemented during
the Imperial-lifetime of
those consulted about it,
but also that students ac-
tually present at the time
of the implementation
have never even heard of
the initiative. Students at
the CSPB were surprised
when they were asked
about tiling preferences
for the Queen's Lawn and
thought it was big news.
In the mind of the College,
they've spoken to students
and received their approv-
al already, years ago.
This dichotomy of
experience in terms of
decision-making and im-
plementation of the result-
ing choices is a massive
problem in terms of ever
reaching a semblance of
democracy in College
life. Hell, it bleeds over
into the Union, too - if
anything, it can be more
extreme, as every rep-
resentative is there for a
year only before being up
for re-election. In fact, the
roles with most respon-
sibility don't even have a
chance to get re-elected
most of the time - the
sabbatical officers almost
universally leave after
their terms, as they are
usually students who have
just finished their degrees.
Well, what solution
would one propose? It's
not an unknown quantity.
Decades-long projects
such are discussed by
students in representative
positions for less than a
full year. The timescales
are difficult to overcome.
On some projects,
you can run continuous
re-evaluation as time
goes by and more detailed
decisions are made.
White City is a good
example of this. However,
smaller-scale projects
are doomed on this front
- running constant consul-
tations, each of which has
slightly different results,
and then implementing
the thoughts of those
consulted, is just not
feasible when the scale of
the project is just a couple
of years and the decisions
to be made are relatively
simple. The resource
involved would be as-
tronomical, and, frankly,
nothing would ever get
done.
Another possible solu-
tion would be for hando-
vers between represent-
atives to include a more
detailed rundown of the
decisions made through
the year. It could be made
a compulsory part of
the role that a 'journal of
activity' is kept, then sum-
marised and passed down.
Unfortunately, this would
just result in bureaucratic
slowdown and the further
issue of high expectations
or ceilings on what are, for
the most part, voluntary
student roles.
Frankly, I don't have
the answers. This is an
ongoing, fundamental
issue that leaves different
stakeholders in univer-
sity life at one another's
throats for reasons neither
can actually do anything
about. Students feel
ignored while the College
is convinced they've taken
the right steps. Perhaps
the real answer is just
to communicate that
better - to open up lines of
communication between
students and the Union
and the College and all the
other stakeholders that are
more effective and more
considerate of the issue.
For example - don't
have a sabbatical officer
who has been in role for a
few months go to a board
of students with many
new representatives and
discuss a plan finalised a
year ago and expect those
students not to be sur-
prised. Figure out a way
to communicate the plan
to them first.
