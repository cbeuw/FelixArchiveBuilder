F
or those unfa-
miliar with this
matter, Bolivia
is a landlocked
country in the western
hemisphere. Called by
many ‘the heart of South
America’, due to its
shape and geographical
location, it is the poorest
country in the region (by
measure of its GDP per
capita and its HDI). From
the 16th century up until
its independence in 1825,
it supplied Spanish con-
querors with a significant
amount of their mineral
wealth. Nowadays, it is
known officially as the
Plurinational State of
Bolivia – as it comprises in
excess of 30 different in-
digenous states. Out of all
Latin American countries,
Bolivia has the highest
proportion of indigenous
people – at nearly 60%
of its inhabitants. Though
of considerable landmass,
its relatively small pop-
ulation is disseminated
across the Andes and the
Amazon and its society
is noticeably stratified.
Much of present-day
wealth is accumulated in
the main cities; while pov-
erty and lack of education
are abundant in the rural
zones. Bolivia’s history
is riddled with struggles
– not least because of its
colonial past, but also as
a result of more recent
conflicts.
Back in 2006, the
first-ever indigenous
president was elected
after a nearly 3-year long
political turmoil. Evo
Morales brought fresh
promises of hope and
bolstered a campaign
for the many and not the
few. He named his party
“MAS (Movimiento Al
Socialismo)”, which
translates to movement
to socialism. In hind-
sight, MAS did achieve
many of its primary
objectives. Economic
growth steadily rose
for the most part of his
ruling, extreme poverty
was drastically reduced,
Bolivia’s position in
the international com-
munity was reinstated,
infrastructure was
nationalised, social in-
clusion was fostered, the
indigenous identity of
the country was boasted,
racism was halted and
programmes of wide-
spread education were
created, amongst others.
He achieved something
that had become long
unbeknownst to Bolivi-
ans – unity and stability.
These things gave way to
his democratic re-elec-
tion on 2009 and 2014.
And indeed, people
voted overwhelmingly
for his remain – with
64% and 63% of the
votes casted for his
party, on each occasion
respectively. Amongst
the most controversial
of his decrees, Morales
expelled the Drug En-
forcement Agency and
expanded widespread
plantations of Coca in
the tropics. Contrary to
his promises, however,
verifiable corruption
scandals soon began
to emerge. One after
another, allegations
against his government
grew ever larger. Some
even argue that his
success was built upon
clandestine founda-
tions – government
expenditure was alleg-
edly financed with the
injection of funds from
drug trafficking, as
many things didn’t quite
make sense. Of course,
this latter allegation was
made on a conspiracy
basis – but was it?
Alas – as time
progressed, his once
humble origins became
overridden by his now
present greed. Private
jets, helicopters, faulty
factories, luxurious
motorcades, full-scale
international airports in
small Coca-producing
towns, an unexplainable
exponential rise in Coca
production, a museum
of himself and even the
erection of a 30-storey
presidential palace were
please those that still
advocated for him, he
chose to go down the
populist strategy by
building football pitches
around the countryside
and spreading political
propaganda across the
nation – in an attempt to
engage with the unedu-
cated masses that were
largely unaware of his
wrongdoings, let alone
extravagances.
Without realising
it at the time, he spelt
the beginning of his
demise on the 21st of
February of 2016. On
that day, Morales called
a referendum seeking to
change Bolivia’s politi-
cal constitution in a way
that would allow him to
run for a 4th consecutive
term – which was and
is illegal. He lost. Not-
withstanding this vote,
he insisted on putting his
presidential bid forward
– breaching the demo-
cratic foundations upon
which Bolivia became
independent, with the
petty argument that ‘it
was within his human
rights to re-run for pres-
idency’. Stemming from
this, peaceful anti-MAS
protests emerged and
progressively got larger
in size. Opposition
parties advocated
Morales’ bid for presi-
dency was unconstitu-
tional, which it was and
is.
Already, rumours
had emerged that the
election would be
rigged – but no one
had anticipated to what
extent to which it would
be. Unsurprisingly, on
the 20th of October of
2019, MAS won the
election – wreaking
the country into a

Morales blatantly mis-
managed the resources
of the poor country he
commanded in order to
do as he pleased, in a ty-
rannical fashion. Slowly
but surely, his party soon
started seizing control of
the legislative, judicial
and executive branches
of the government –
which, by law, should
operate independently of
each other. Much of the
electorate that had voted
for him became upset by
these actions, thereby
leading him to gradually
lose the overwhelming
support he once had. To
