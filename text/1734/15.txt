The Mikado - stylish set, passé plot
T
he Mikado is
perhaps the most
w e l l - k n o w n
of Gilbert and
Sullivan’s Victorian-era
comic operas, famously
set in Japan. Why Japan,
one might wonder? Back
in 1885, it was all about
keeping political satire
hidden in plain sight.
By setting their scenes
in fantastical or wildly
foreign locales, Gilbert
and Sullivan could excuse
their critique of Victorian
politics and society.
Their Japan makes no
claim to authenticity. It
was the Japan seen ‘on
vase and jar / on screen
and fan’: the cheap
imitation goods shipped
en masse to Britain in
the late 1800s. We can
tell from the ‘exotic’ but
ridiculously un-Japanese
names – our heroine is
called ‘Yum-Yum’ and
her wide-eyed lover ‘Nan-
ki-Poo’.
In light of actual
knowledge about Japan,
that sort of thing sounds
distinctly racist. In 1986,
English National Opera
director Jonathan Miller
made the brilliantly inno-
vative step of getting rid
of the faux-Japan setting
entirely. Instead of parodic
kimonos and sliding
screens, he transformed
it into a lush seaside hotel
in 1920s Bournemouth.
Three decades on, the
set by Stefanos Lazaridis
is as timeless as ever.
Dazzlingly white, palm
trees and fountains project
opulence while curly-
haired French maids and
slick butlers in tailcoats
enliven the stage. All in
all it felt like a riotous
cabaret.
If only the plot had
aged half as well. The
only modern bit was the
much-anticipated ‘little
list’ where Ko-Ko the
executioner, casting about
for someone to behead,
calls out modern polit-
ical figures who would
‘not be missed’ if they
were gone. It’s updated
with every production;
here, Boris Johnson and
Priti Patel were wittily
castigated in rhyme. The
audience woke up to
roar with laughter at this,
then sleepily quietened
down for the rest of the
performance. Delightful
as Lazaridis’ set may be,
it cannot hide the fact
that there is something
distinctly dated about the
plot – rather like staging
a traditional Punch and
Judy in the modern day.
While the caricatures
and humour were a little
too in-your-face for me,
the pensioners in the
audience were cackling
away. The lead singers,
both Harewood Artists
(young opera singers
beginning their career),
were very good. Soraya
Mafi was a delightfully
coquettish Yum-Yum, her
soaring soprano bringing
sparkle to both her solo
arias and duets. Elgan Llŷr
Thomas made a vibrant
and innocently earnest
Nanki-Poo. Yvonne
Howard, as Katisha, was a
bit frail and weak for the
formidable doyenne she
portrayed, but the rest of
the singers rounded off the
cast solidly. Some less-
than-lively conducting
of the orchestra by Chris
Hopkins perhaps added
to the staid atmosphere.
Nevertheless, the classic
Gilbert and Sullivan farce
will be a pleasure to fans
of the genre, and promises
well-polished entertain-
ment for the uninitiated.
Harry Potter in Concert: A magical musical evening
I
magineyourfavourite
movie – any movie.
Now, imagine it again
without the music
and its iconic soundtrack:
it would simply not be the
same. Music is a huge part
of creating a film’s atmos-
phere, creating the right
ambience and enhancing
the emotional tug of the
moment. And what better
way to experience the
spellbinding magic of J.K.
Rowling’s classic saga
by watching it on the big
screen, accompanied by
a live orchestra playing
through the entire film’s
soundtrack? The Royal
Albert Hall’s Films in
Concert series gave the
audience a truly magical
experience as we redis-
covered the 4th instalment
of the Harry Potter series,
all in the stunning sur-
roundings of the Royal
Albert Hall.
The evening was ide-
al in every way. The live
orchestra added a special
quality to the film, making
the soundtrack have more
presence than in the usu-
al recorded playback. Yet
it did not detract from or
distract us from the plot.
Every note was precise,
flawlessly executed to the
point where you almost
forgot that it wasn’t just
the soundtrack, but in fact
a live orchestra in front
of our very noses. It also
helped us to appreciate
exactly which instruments
were responsible for var-
ious themes through the
film, from the brass-led
theme of the Durmstrang
boys to the triumphant
iconic theme. The levels
of sound in the hall were
just right as well: the or-
chestra was never over-
whelmingly loud, nor was
the recorded audio too
soft, with just the right
amount of emphasis on
the music. It was so nos-
talgic to be thrown back
into the younger years of
Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert
Grint and Emma Watson,
and relive those trepida-
tion-filled moments as
Harry fought the drain,
swam with merpeople and
met with Voldemort face-
to-face for the first time.
After the show, I got to
attend a Q+A session with
the Oscar-nominated com-
poser of the film Patrick
Doyle. It was fascinating
to uncover his thought
process as he wrote the
music. Doyle explained
that he composed with the
actors’ range of pitch and
vocal timbre in mind, and
had to constantly be aware
of the dialogue, sound ef-
fects and visuals going on.
His proudest composition
of the film was for Cedric
Diggory’s death. Written
by hand on a bit of a nap-
kin, Doyle composed the
music to capture the con-
current contrast between
the happy festivities and
the grief of death. Using
a wide spatial range and
harmonies of suspense, all
in time with the dialogue,
I am certain we can agree
that the music emphasised
the reactions of the char-
acters whilst keeping the
emotion pumping through
the moment.
Overall, it was won-
derful to relive the 4th
instalment of the iconic
Harry Potter films on the
big screen, with a flawless
live orchestra. I would
highly recommend expe-
riencing a film live in con-
cert for everyone.

Hall’s Films in Concert
