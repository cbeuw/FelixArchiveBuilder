A
five year-long
investigation
by NegaFelix
has revealed the
extensive use of deep fake
software by lecturers at
Imperial College London.
Deep fake software is
used to realistically
superimpose faces onto
people in videos. The
videos created are often
incredibly realistic and
can be easily mistaken
for real life. The software
has been used to create
pornographic videos of
celebrities, videos of pol-
iticians saying outrageous
things and videos of
public figures endorsing
products. The scale of the
problem has caused a lot
of concern in the political
world and there has been
talk of regulating its use.
Members of Parliament
would perhaps be better
served looking closer to
home. Today the Neg-
aFelix investigative team
reveals how Imperial
College lecturers use deep
fake software to create
fake Panopto recordings.
Lecturers plaster their
face onto footage of
another lecturer to avoid
having to attend lectures
themselves. One user of
this method agreed to
speak to the team off the
record.
“There are never any
students there anyway.
This way I can pre-record
all my lectures at the
beginning of the year
and get on with doing my
actual research.”
The endemic nature
of the problem was high-
lighted when investigators
noticed that all of the lec-
turers were using the same
video footage to base their
deep fake lectures on.
Closer inspection revealed
that this video was in fact
from 2007 suggesting that
not a single lecture had
been recorded in person
since then.
A different anonymous
source admitted that they
used the time freed up by
their Panopto deep fakes
to stay in bed longer.
“I just can’t stand 9 am
lectures. That was my
main reason for starting,
an extra hour in bed, but
it was all so easy that I
couldn’t resist doing the
rest of the lectures that
way.”
Unfortunately, the
roots of the problem are
so deep that it will take
more than a simple inves-
tigation to end this kind
of behaviour. When the
investigative team tried
to contact Alice Ghast’s
office for a comment an
automated message told
them to “Bugger off”.
