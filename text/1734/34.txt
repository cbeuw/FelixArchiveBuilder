S
hocking scenes
on campus today,
after a College
careers advisor
was brutally pummeled
to death under a hail of
pumice today having
suggested to students
that they take a new path
at a careers consultation.
Labi Angbridge, 69, had
worked for the college
for many years prior to
this incident. Colleagues
professed that she
showed a great aptitude
at providing students
with JP Morgan appli-
cations forms printed on
advice to a group of
geology students when all
of a sudden they whipped
out pieces of volcanic
rock from within their
coats and within minutes
she was slain. I’ll never
underestimate the power
of a chunk of slate again.”
Students have been
complaining about the
challenges of the modern
job market. A student that
took part in the stoning,
commenting anonymous-
ly said, “I mean what was I
supposed to do? I was told
when I arrived that all I
would need to do was lick
rocks in search of petro-
leum products for the rest
of my life. She kept rec-
ommending a move away
to renewables. I can’t tell
anyone anything useful
by licking a fucking wind
turbine. I mean the hit rate
for getting interviews and
then the actual job is even
lower than getting a date
in this gender blighted rat
hole of a university.. At
least you know where you
Angbridge. One student,
wearing a Shell cap,
grasping Camel cigarettes
and a North Korean
whaling company’s com-
plementary harpoon, said,
“She always had the right
literature. Whether it was
arms, oil or pharmaceu-
ticals, she would always
point you in the direction
of the morally dubious
ﬁrm that was just right for
you.”
A recruiter for a major
ﬁnance ﬁrm comment-
ed, “Unfortunately,
the careers advisers at
Imperial lack the ability
to provide a crucial
component of any CV: an
Oxbridge degree.”

ernment to change the

another of its career advis-
ers died whilst providing
advice to a student in the
presence of their parents.
“They told them to follow
their dreams. Obviously,
the parents did not take
that well. Dreams don’t
earn you 100 thousand a
year and a comfortable
retirement.”
College has been con-
sidering providing secu-
rity to careers advisers in
the wake of these attacks
but has instead built a
new path across Queen’s
Lawn for students to take.
It is hoped that in the long
run, rejected applicants to
venture capital ﬁrms can
be employed while they
hone their CVs.

ioned bash with a rock. If
you hit them, they always
call you back.”
Other students and col-
leagues had had similar

could easily double as
a tissue when they were
inevitably rejected for
