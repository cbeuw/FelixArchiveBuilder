As a reminder of the
purpose of Council: the
Council is the highest
democratic decision-mak-
ing body in the Union,
at which the full-time
Officer Trustees (OTs) and
key student volunteers
put policies into place,
address ongoing issues by
submitting and discuss-
ing papers, and receive
updates from the OTs on
their activities to hold
them accountable.
The focus of this report
is discussions around the
policies and reports that
are not accounted for in
the submitted papers and
reports – these are visible
online.
Policy Reform Motion
F
irst, the bureau-
cratic mess that
is Union policy.
A motion was
put forward regarding
the restructuring of how
policies are put into place
via Council – specifically,
this was instigated by the
fact that all but one of the
Union’s policies had tech-
nically ‘lapsed’ and thus
were no longer actually
policies. In other words,
prior to this Council, the
Union had only one active
policy total.
The amount of time it
would take for Council to
manually move through
and vote whether to
refresh or dismiss every
single expired policy
would be unproductive –
and so the proposal was
that this task be delegated
to various subcommittees
of Council, where a policy
falls under their specific
remit. Of note is the fact
thatthedecisionsonpolicy
made by subcommittees
does not have to then be
approved by Council – in
other words, a smaller
body of representatives
are making decisions on
Union policy unless the
policy is “radical”. Who
decides whether the policy
needs to go to Council or
a subcommittee appears
to be the policy proposer
themselves.
While this shifts power
downwards from Union
Council to various stake-
holders, in some sense
improving the democratic
process, it also poses risks
to democracy by remov-
ing the process of a full
democratic vote from all
Council representatives
on each issue.
Additionally, many
things which were once
instigated as policies have
instead been moved to
being ‘actions’ – in other
words, it will no longer
be a full Union policy for
a specific person to do a
specific thing.
The motion was passed
by the Council.
Proposal for an
Elected Postgraduate
Trustee
Currently, the Board of
Trustees – a body which
oversees the whole of the
Union and has student,
sabbatical officer, and ex-
ternal members – has no
postgraduate representa-
tion, as the elected trustees
are often undergraduates.
The debate opened with
the motion that there
should be a specific post-
graduate representative on
the Board.
The issue presented by
some Council members is
that this poses a conflict
of interest, as Board of
Trustee members are
theoretically meant to
consider the benefit of all
students – not to represent
a specific group (such as
postgraduates) – although
this is not actually detailed
in the constitution or bye-
laws. Should one member
have a specific remit for
postgraduates, and the
others be considering the
needs of all students, this
leaves an imbalance.
Various suggestions
were offered – such as
having both an elected
postgraduate trustee and
an elected undergraduate
trustee, or compensating
for overrepresentation of
elected undergraduates on
the Board via the appoint-
ed trustees. A suggestion
offered on the paper
was for the postgraduate
trustee to be the President
of the Graduate Students’
Union (GSU), which is a
part-time sabbatical role.
Particularly spicy were
comments offered that if
postgraduates do not run,
or postgraduates do not
vote, for elected positions
then it is because they do
not care enough about the
Union. This was fiercely
rebutted by postgraduate
representatives at Council.
This then span into
discussion of whether this
was a “heavy-handed”
way of dealing with the
problem of postgraduate
involvement, and a symp-
tomatic treatment rather
than dealing with the root
of the problem.
As a result, the Council
did not approve the
motion – a defeat for the
Union President on the
first paper brought to
Council this year.
Election of Subcom-
mittee Members
Various members of
Council nominated them-
selves for different sub-
committees; the resulting
elected members will be
visible online.
Reports
Due to time pressures,
most reports were de-
scribed simply as “as
tabled”, and the floor was
opened for discussion.
Of note were comments
made during the GSU
report about postgraduate
engagement, which is
a matter being looked
into throughout this year.
Additionally, financial
matters were raised – spe-
cifically that ringfenced
funding is often useless
when it does not match
with the actual strategy
and direction of the GSU.
Additionally, the DPCS
confirmed that transport
strategies to the Harling-
ton sports grounds are
currently being worked on
by the Activities team in
the Union.
Finally, a report was
made about the proposed
path on the Queen’s Lawn
– which is further dis-
cussed within the News
section of Felix this week.
Felix Reports: Second Union Council
The second Union Council of the year met on 5th November to discuss policy and hear reports from sabbatical
officers and constituent union Presidents
“First, the
bureaucratic
mess that is
the Unions
policy
situation”
