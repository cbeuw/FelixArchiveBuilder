the value they represent

eing someone
who studies
maths, it’s often
assumed that I
like nothing more than to
think about numbers. In
reality of course, studying
maths is actually one the
safest ways to be sure that
you’ll never see one, and
there’s a part of me which
isgratefulforthis,forwhat
initially might seem to be
a pretty dumb reason. The
more I think about it, the
more I’m convinced that
one of the most damaging
traits of modernity is how
we think about numbers.
Now I know what you’re
thinking: “What are you
talking about? Surely
there are more importa-”
and yes, you’re probably
right about that, but if
you’ve made it this far
you may as well continue.
too controversial to claim
that under capitalism,
prices exist. Prices are
interesting because they
attach a transcendental
quality to something
material, and so they
elevate a commodity to
something greater than its
value in use. More inter-
to grow for its own sake,
and so not only is value
conflated with number,
but to maximise value, the
numbers must get bigger.
To the person who lives
and breathes the dominant
ideology of their time
- which is everyone -
this “number – value”
life may as well be in
binary. Even before you
leave school though,
the pervasive culture
of testing increasingly
encourages students to see
themselves as their marks,
and in particular to see
themselves in reference
to the marks of others.
inator of these things is
the definition of personal
value in terms of numbers,
and in particular the ease
with which that leads
to clear, well-defined
goals for self-validation.
Basically, it’s a lot easier
to aim towards a number
for your happiness than
Life in three, 2019 // Androlás Melrique
“[Prices]
conflate the
abstract
idea of value
with... the
constructed
idea of price”
The punchline here
is that the link between
feelings of anxiety and
number can partly be
put down to the nature
of numbers themselves.
Numbers possess a cold
and alien quality. They are
associated with robotic
logic and rigidity, so the
psychological process
of associating one’s own
value and success with
sets of numbers becomes
a process of alienation
from the self. Not only
that, but the attainment of
self-value in this alienated
form is totally fleeting
and illusory, because the
number is ideologically
pre-loaded to never be
content with stillness –
this is the aforementioned
nature of capital, and in
practice it means that until
you let go of the associa-
tion, you can’t meaning-
fully be content. In this
way, this anxiety can be
thought of as intrinsically
existential, and it finds its
logical basis in the capi-
talist association between
number and value.
Let me be clear: I’m
not saying that numbers
would only exist under
capitalism or anything like
that, or that they would
only become overused
in that context. What I
am saying is that under
capitalism, numbers take
on an interesting role as
placeholders of value, and
that this role needs to be
understood as the weird
thing that it is and for the
weird things it makes us
do. At the end of it all, it’s
important for any society
to critically evaluate the
meaning of its symbols,
and that’s just as true
about numbers as it is
about rambling polemics

it is to aspire to some
abstract bullshit about
contentment (note that in
precisely the same way,
it’s easier for companies
to aim for profits over
broader social goals).
The question is, does this
ease translate into actual
happiness for people?
The fact that we often
hear about the negative
mental health impacts of
things like intensive and
constant testing implies
that probably not, but that
begs another question:
why not?
esting still, they conflate
the abstract idea of value
with the essentially con-
structed idea of price – in
the market, price is value
after all. Essentially, we
have an economic system
whose foundation is (at
least in part) built on this
interaction of objects
and the numbers which
both transcend them and
define their value. We
can take this analysis
further – according to
Marx, the defining feature
of capital as opposed to
simple money is its need
association in the abstract
becomes inescapable in
the material. One’s per-
formance in school, for
instance, is reduced to
a set of numbers which
are treated almost as the
product of years of labour.
This is no coincidence of
course: the school system
as we know it today was
born in and modelled on
the mass production lines
of the Industrial Revo-
lution, so in a sense it’s
completely unsurprising
that the outward expres-
sion of one’s educational
The extent to which
culture and political
economy interact cannot
be overstated. It shouldn’t
be too avant-garde a state-
ment to claim that if we
lived how they are. So it
was under feudalism, so it
is today. I don’t think it’s
This is not at all dissimilar
to the state of affairs in
social media: Online,
your value is thought of in
terms of like or follower

experimented earlier this
year with disabling public

this, which I think repre-
