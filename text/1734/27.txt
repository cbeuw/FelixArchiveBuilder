Sonic the Hedgehog. Wait... is it good now?
E
arlier this year,
P a r a m o u n t
released a trailer
for the new Sonic
the Hedgehog movie.
One word describes this:
terrifying. The render
of Sonic was closer to a
deformed cat than to what
Sonic should look like
in the games. Boasting
human-like teeth that a
dentist would be proud
of (clearly ﬂossing) and
unnervingly realistic eyes
and hands, this Sonic
pushed the internet to utter
outrage. People all over
different social media
platforms constantly
tagged Paramount telling
them that it had to be
changed. Unlike most big
companies, they actually
listened! Jeff Fowler, the
director of the movie said
soon after:
“The message is loud
and clear... you aren’t
happy with the design &
you want changes. It’s
going to happen.”
It was great to see this,
but after that message we
were left in the dark...
until now! The new and
improved trailer has
been released and oh my
goodness does it look
great! I would argue that
this is the best render
of Sonic we have ever
recieved, even in the
games! The proportions
are perfect now with more
cartoon-like features as
opposed to the strange,
anthropomorphised look
that was present previ-
ously. Further to this,
the actual content of the
trailer was entertaining. It
looked fast paced with a
focus on witty comedy and
that over-conﬁdent Sonic
charm we all love. With
Ben Schwartz voice-act-
ing Sonic and Jim Carrey
as Doctor Robotnik, the
ﬁlm deﬁnitely has the star
power behind it to create
something special. I won’t
spoil the plot here, but it
doesn’t look like your
generic movie that doesn’t
bring anything new to the
table.
Backing the trailer, a
remix of Green Hill Zone
was playing that gave me
those feeling that only true
nostalgia can bring you.
It is clear that they know
what the fans want and
I am extremely excited
to see what the ﬁnished
project looks like.
Now that we all have
what we want, some
people assume that it was
all a ploy. The new look
of Sonic, and the movie
as a whole, is almost too
perfect. This makes many
believe that Paramount
had always been working
on this version of the
movie; they purposefully
made a trailer that looked
disgusting to get more
people talking about the
movie. Then they would
get way more sales when
they ‘benevolently’
went out of their way to
recreate the movie. This
sort of adds up.
If I could give my two
cents I would not nec-
essarily agree with this.
After the recent success of
a similar movie, Detective
Pikachu, it is clear that
there is no need to trick
your audience. Create a
good product and it will
sell well. So to everyone
still complaining about
this, I would say just try to
be happy with the movie
now that it looks good
and just enjoy it for what
it is! I hope you are all as
excited for this movie as
me and I talk to you all
next week.
