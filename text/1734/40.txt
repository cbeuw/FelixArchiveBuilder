N o v e m b e r
morning, when
all should have
been asleep and enjoying a
Sunday morning lie-in, 15
brave Imperial triathletes
decided to brave the cold
weather and race at the
Hillingdon Duathlon. The
skies had cleared from the
Saturday’s rain to leave
us all with brilliant race
conditions: sunshine,
gentle breeze, and not too
hot (but it was freezing).
The race consisted of a
3km run, 15km bike and a
1.5km run.
At 8 am, men’s race
began. It was a strong
start with Henry Hart
leading the run, Romain
Barnoud hard on his
heels. Matt Ryan and
Tom Butler were also just
behind them. After some
speedy runs, they were
onto the bike stage, and
Imperial boys had to come
to terms with counting
the ten laps required of
the bike course. This
was very challenging,
despite everyone having
strong mathematical
backgrounds, but luckily
they were no miscounts
from our squad. The bike
laps sped by, and before
we knew it the men were
coming back into tran-
sition. Henry Hart sped
away with an incredibly
fast 3.03min/km to win
first place for Imperial.
Romain Barnoud soon
followed winning third.
Matt Ryan and Tom
Butler came fourth and
fifth respectively. It was a
fantastic result overall for
the guys with bottles of
wine being rewarded for
the podium finishers. New
to the club this year, Ben
McDonnell, Roman Allais
and Thibault Lavallé, all
had strong finishes as well
and enjoyed their time
race began. The wonder-
ful Ben McDonnell and
Romain Barnoud played
the much-appreciated role
of personal photographers
and support squad for
the girls, helping them
finish with terrific times.
Fiona Sander stormed
away with her run and
bike times, lapping many
as she made her way to
the top of the podium.
Sophia Vorderwuelbecke
did incredibly well and
finished her brilliant
race in the third position.
Marion Artigaut and Jess
Eichel decided to have an
ultimate game of cat and
mouse and were chasing
each other all around the
circuit. Cass Kennedy,
despite her many injuries,
had a successful race and
finished with a relieved
smile on her face. Mary
Chapman was the athlete
of the week for TriIC and
finished her first race in
great time and eager to do
more races. TriIC alumni,
Esme Hoston Moore,
realised how much she
misses tri and joined for
the race and had a lovely
time racing and catching
up with her fellow IC tri-
athletes. Treasurer Emma
Claxton also did great.
Overall, we had a fan-
tastic race with 1st, 3rd,
4th and 5th in both the
men’s and women’s races.
Well done all!
Let us tell you all about this amazing show, with prose written by experienced writers, well-versed in their chosen
field, bursting with metaphor.
