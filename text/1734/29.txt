of an illustrious yet controversial franchise.

initially seems far too
difficult to tackle.
Music
The aesthetic of the
Fallout series is very
reminiscent of a Raygun
Gothic style. This gives
it a very 1950s America
feel which is especially
prominent in the music of
the series. Unfortunately,
the first game in the series
did not push this very far,
with only one song in the
soundtrack being particu-
larly memorable.
Maybe by the Inkspots
(1940) plays occasionally
throughout the game,
lending a somewhat
positive atmosphere to the
dreary setting. This clear
dichotomy produces a
very unique feeling which
no other game soundtrack
has replicated that I can
think of.
The remainder of the
soundtrack consists of
creepy ambient noises,
accompanied by sounds
of clanking metal and
spine-chilling synth-
line instruments. This
created a sense of tension
which remained with me
whenever I would boot
up the game. It took a
long time to get used to
which shows just how
good Mark Morgan (the
composer) was at creating
a feeling of survival and
loneliness.
That said there felt like
in the background to keep
my ears interested. 10/10
for immersion but I would
have enjoyed something
more memorable.
Art
While many may
disagree, I personally
LOVED the art style of
Fallout. The metallic
colour pallet combined
with the isometric view
gave a sense of a very
makeshift world. What
I mean by this is that all
the settlements in the
game while unique in
design all felt unified
under a common theme.
This theme being that
they were built quickly
and unplanned through
whatever resources could
be scavenged.
The main point to
write home about is the
“Talking Heads”. These
are certain characters in
the game which, when
spoken to, will be fully
voice-acted (amazingly
might I add), as well
as having very detailed
animations of the face.
This makes it feel like
you are actually speaking
to a person rather than it
just being a still face with
some shoddy voice acting.
The heads can be jarring
at first but when you get
used to the art style you
can really appreciate what
they were going for.
When designing these
heads, real models were
made with different
facial expressions and
the GURPS system was
able to create a transition
from one to the other.
The ability to understand
the way the conversation
was going entirely from
the facial expressions of
who you were talking
to is purely brilliant and
something which I believe
should be implemented
far more, even today.
Legacy
Fallouts legacy is one
which cannot be under-
stated. While many argue
the sequel, Fallout 2, is
better, this original paved
the way for future CRPGs.
CNET Gamecenter’s
Mark H. Walker wrote,
“The RPG genre was
clearly in a slump in the
mid-’90s, but in August
1997 the renaissance
began when Inter-
play’s Fallout hit store
shelves.”
I could not agree more
with this sentiment. It has
been ranked in the top 20
PC games of all time many
years by IGN, PC gamer
and PC zone. And in 2012
was even exhibited in the
Smithsonian American
Art Museum.
The gameplay was
inspired by games such
as X-COM and has gone
on to change the face of
CRPGs for years. The
art has been put on show
in museums. The setting
spawned a massively
successful series. Whether
or not you think Fallout
deserves the praise it
gets as a game in its own
right, one cannot deny the
impact it has had on the
gaming industry.
Score
Overall the game was a
blast to play. I have never
really played a game quite
like it, despite playing
so many that have taken
inspiration from it. The
combat can be boring and
sometimes aspects of the
game are very difficult to
figure out, such as how
to get the most out of a
companion. However, the
setting and atmosphere
are unique and the ability
to truly influence the story
in a multitude of ways
makes this an instant
classic, definitely deserv-
ing of game of the year in
1997.
I would rate it 88%.
It is a must-play for a
fan of older PC games, a
fan of RPGs and a fan of
any game that makes you
think for yourself. If you
can get over the occasion-
al bit of confusion with
the mechanics then you
will have a blast.

little variety and after a
while, I would find myself
putting on different music
