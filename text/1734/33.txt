Home-made Ramen: How to Class Up the Simplest
and Cheapest Meal on the Student Menu

T
his week I decid-
ed to ditch the
packaged staple
of every student
diet, instant ramen, and
make it from scratch. The
process of ﬁnding a recipe
took a little longer than
expected as there were
so many to choose from.
Luckily, all of them had
similar components, so
the one I settled on had
ingredients that I was
Delicious home-made ramen! // Mariam Jallow
“The making
of the broth
itself was
much easier
than I had
envisioned”
Ingredients:
1tsp sesame oil
1tsp olive oil
2 garlic cloves
2tsp grated ginger
60g carrots
60g mushrooms
900ml vegetable
stock
1tbs vinegar
3tbs soy sauce
1tbs sriracha sauce
80g noodles
familiar with and, more
importantly, required me
to spend the least money.
This recipe is from the
food blogging website
Killing Thyme which
matched my requirements
and pun needs.
The making of the
broth itself was much
easier than I had envi-
sioned.
to elevate the textures
and ﬂavours of ramen. I
opted for a classic soft-
boiled egg with some
nori accompanied with
kimchi for a slightly sour
hint. One of the things
that I think makes ramen
so popular aside from its
convenience is the fact
that all its components
can be adjusted to suit
each individual per-
son’s taste. While I had
a boiled egg, you could
just as easily have had a
fried egg, used chicken
stock instead of vegetable
stock, made it vegetarian
and add tofu, or even
used zoodles instead if
you’re into that; the pos-
sibilities are endless!
I found that the home-
made ramen had an
amazing depth of ﬂavour
which you don’t get with
instant ramen. The big-
gest difference between
making your own ramen
and buying its instant
counterpart is making the
broth itself. Instead of
simply pouring out a ﬂa-
vour sachet, this requires
a little more effort and
input on your part. How-
ever, homemade ramen
gives you the ﬂexibility
and freedom to directly
choose what ingredients
and ﬂavours go into your
bowl. This, mixed with
the addition of fresh
vegetables, adds a dif-
ferent level of tastes and
textures compared to the
soft, one-note texture you
usually ﬁnd with instant
ramen. Another notable
difference was with the
noodles. I decided to use
egg noodles, which really
added to the authenticity
as I wasn’t under time
pressure to eat quickly
out of fear of the noodles
going soggy. There was
a signiﬁcant price differ-
ence between the compo-
nents of the homemade
ramen and the instant
packet. Excluding the
additional topping, which
I admit was relatively
pricey, I spent just under
£6. This is a drastic jump
from the usual 90p that I
can understand some peo-
ple would be unwilling to
make. However, I would
still consider this to be a
cheap meal especially if
you take into account the
variance in price depend-
ing on what ingredients
you decide to include.
Although I admit this
process is a little more
time consuming, it’s
still relatively quick and
easy to make compared
to many other foods. In
total the whole process
took me just under half
an hour to complete - not
ideal when it’s 1 AM,
you’re starving, and you
Food Writer Mariam Jallow experiments with making ramen feel sumptuous, without breaking the bank - and
without requiring any special cooking skills!
Begin by simmering
the garlic and ginger for a
couple of minutes in the
oils.
Follow by adding the
carrots and mushrooms
and cooking until soft
then top it off by adding
the stock (needs to be
mixed with hot water
to form a broth). Finish
by adding the sriracha,
vinegar and soy sauce to
your taste and allow it to
simmer for ﬁve minutes.
At this point I began to
diverge a little from the
original recipe by also
adding chilli sauce to give
it more heat and prawns.
Once this is complete,
simply add the noodles
to the broth and allow it
to cook to complete the
meal.
However, as every
ramen-obsessive knows,
an amazing ramen bowl
doesn’t just stop there.
There are a variety of
different garnishes you
can add to your bowl
have an exam the next the
next day, but it’s deﬁnite-
ly worth the time.
I can no longer fully
enjoy a bowl of instant
ramen without hearing
my mum complain about
the high salt content and
her overdramatic exag-
geration of the negative
health implications.
It was a nice contrast
knowing that my diet was
being positively impacted
by the bowl of ramen for
a change.
So if you’re someone
who’s willing to spend
a little extra time and
money in order to make
something healthy and
wholesome then I would
deﬁnitely recommend this
recipe.
