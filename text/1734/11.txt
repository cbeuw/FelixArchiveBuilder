state of havoc. From
that moment onwards,
pro-democracy strikes
have been taking place
in the country. Peoples
of all colours, from
all excerpts of society
(miners, farmers, indig-
enous leaders, doctors,
students, bankers,
businessmen and even
some people from MAS’
cabinet) have since been
peacefully protesting
against these acts of
corruption. Boxes
upon boxes of crooked
ballot-papers favouring
him were found and
burnt. Even deceased
people were reported to
have voted for him. The
opposition candidates
have been desperately
holding meetings with
news channels and pre-
senting evidence against
the fraud, demanding
a new democratic
election be held. In
an attempt to diffuse
tensions and intimidate
the pro-democracy
strikers, Evo Morales
threatened to shut down
water supplies and
fence off the cities. His
government bribed the
armed forces to ensure
they remained under
state control; but even
then, after a sustained
vow for democracy,
the police and the army
rose against injustice
and sided for the people
engaging in the peaceful
protests. Never has
there existed so much
cohesion amongst Bo-
livian’s for one common
goal – new elections and
justice.
The Organisation of
American States, an
impartial continental
body, performed an
audit on this elector-
al process – only to
conclude it was indeed
fraudulent. There exists
factual proof backing
this claim. As a result
of this, most of MAS’
government resigned –
including the president
and the vice-president,
upon facing increasing
scrutiny. And, to counter
these peaceful protests,
MAS has been mobi-
lising its populist sup-
port-group by feeding
it fake facts, arming
them, manipulating the
truth, instilling hate,
promoting violence and
strategically deploying
messages in the media
that aim to victimise
Morales – saying he
was debased by far-
right campaigns and a
military coup ousted
him from office, de-
liberately framing him
in a situation far off
reality. On late Monday
evening, Evo Morales
fled to Mexico after he
was granted political
asylum by his Mexican
homologue.
As I write this, my
family, my friends and
everyone I know is in
a state of apprehension
– fearing for their lives
and for their future. A
new transitory president
has now constitution-
ally taken office, but
still – violent mobs of
MAS-supporters have
been sacking buildings,
burning buses, raping
women, killing people
and loudly chanting
“CIVIL WAR”. Their
purposes are devoid of
meaning, as they have
been coerced to believe
the fight for democracy
is being held
against them – as
opposed to the corrupt
rule of their Machiavel-
lian leader. The military
and the police have
deployed their patrols
to prevent the escalation
of this conflict and avert
bloodshed. Neighbours
of many different zones
have built barricades
to protect themselves
against the threat
posed by these violent
insurgents. Fighter jets
are sweeping across
the skies to bring back
stability and take back
control from those that
are violently trying to
usurp it.
From afar, all I can
do is reach out to others,
rectify the spread of fake
news and let the truth be
known. I can’t help but
wonder: Will this lead
to the demise of other
authoritarian regimes,
namely those of Vene-
zuela and Cuba? Will
this unveil a network
of mass-corruption
between Latin American
countries – seamlessly
cooperating with each
other, in an unprece-
dented scale? Will this,
at long last, bring about
the positive change
Bolivians so desire?
Will the new leadership
be able to mend the
damage that was caused
more remembered as an
inflection point in Bo-
livia’s cultural heritage?
Will Morales go down
into the annals of history
as a self-made farmer
that rose to become
the first indigenous
president of Bolivia or
as the despotic dictator
that battered his country
with corruption? All
these questions remain
unanswered. One thing
is for sure: now more
than ever, the country
must unite and fight for
its democracy, engage
in peaceful processes,
bear its multi-cultural
identity with pride,
abide by the rule of law,
learn from its past and
look at the bright oppor-
tunities that lie ahead.
***************
I urge you to inform
yourself on this situa-
tion. Please, help spread
the word about what is
happening in Bolivia.
The spread of fake news
is rampant and is manip-
ulating the events in a
way to make them seem
as though there had been
a military coup against
Morales – when in fact
he is an incontrovertible
criminal that ought to be
held accountable for his
crimes.
in the latter period of
MAS’ mandate? Will
this chapter be forever-
