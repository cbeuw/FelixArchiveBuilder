hat are
Investment
banks and
why should
you care? Investment
banks are financial insti-
tutions that provide two
main services; brokerage
and corporate advisory.
Investment banks: A closer look
company during it’s IPO.
What about bringing
companies together? It
refers to mergers and
acquisitions (M&A)
among companies. An
investment bank would
provide advise to compa-
nies looking to merge or
looking to acquire another
company.
Lastly, structuring
products. For example, if
a company requires a fi-
nancial product to finance
a specific project. but
doesn’t know how to go
about pricing and selling
it, they approach the in-
vestment bank to get help
designing this product and
advertising it to the retail
or commercial banking
market.
Brokerage
Individuals familiar
with investing and trading
on the stock market will
be familiar with this arm
of the investment bank,
the brokerage. The bro-
kerage is responsible for
matching the seller to the
buyer in the market place ,
such as the London Stock
Exchange. In the market
place, there are a list of
financial products or secu-
rities being sold, namely
stocks, bonds, exchange
traded funds, options and
is both a brokerage and
a corporate advisory.
Therefore, it is important
for investment banks
to separate these two
divisions. These two areas
are often referred to as
the “front office” and the
“back office”.
Salaries
IfworkingonIPOs,ana-
lysing companies or any
of the above mentioned,
does not interest you,
maybe salaries would. As
an analyst at an invest-
ment bank, based on data
from Dartmouth Partners
you could possibly make
50K per annuum in your
first year of joining a
major investment bank..
Figure 1. shows the salary
and bonus figures for the
top investment banks in
warrents to name a few.
The investment bank
itself can also participate
in the exchange of secu-
rities but are subjected to
certain conditions. With
that being said the broker-
age has its own analysts
that observe market trends
and economic data to
offer buy and sell recom-
mendations to its clients
and usually charge its
clients for each trade that
is made.
The invisible wall
Observant ones will
realise that there can be
conflicts of interest within
the investment bank,
since the investment bank
“...you could
possibly
make 50K
per annuum
in your first
year of joining
a major
investment
bank.”

In the news: Fossil fuel
financing
Another aspect of in-
vestment banks not men-
tioned above is corporate
financing. This is where
investment banks offer
loans to large scale
and/or expensive projects.
For example, a recent
Guardian article, titled
“Top investment banks
provide billions to expand
fossil fuel industry”,
discussed the increase in
funding by investment
banks on fossil fuel
projects (See Figure 2).
In the news: Mental
health in banks
An article by Reuters
titled “Therapy in the
office: banks take mental
health fight in-house”.
outlines that two thirds
of employees in financial
services experience
mental illness and also
discuss ways in which
banks aim to make the
work environments more
friendly. This aspect of the
career is worth exploring
if you are considering
a career in investment
banking.
In the news: Insider
trading
It was mentioned
earlier in the article that
investment banks need
to maintain the invisible
wall. An article by the
financial times “Trio
of investment bankers
charged with insider
trading” highlights this
invisible wall to an extent
and the bad practice in this
area of the banking sector.
Three investors were in-
vestigated on the grounds
that they allegedly sold
information to a mid-
dleman who would then
pass the information on to
traders to execute trades.
In the article the trio were
deemed to have engaged
in insider trading, which
happens to be a crime
given the context.
What is insider trading?
It refers to the use of in-
formation not disclosed to
the public to make trades.
However, this is an over-
simplification of the term
insider trading because it
depends on laws govern-
ing the trade and to make
matters worse, there is an
illegal and legal classifi-
cation to insider trading.
Corporate advisory
There are three main
services that investment
banks provide in corpo-
rate advisory, they are:
bringing companies to
market, bringing compa-
nies together and structur-
ing products.
Bringing companies
to market refers to the
Initial Public Offering of
company shares or IPOs.
This occurs when a private
company intends to raise
funds by selling some
equity or shares, which
represent ownership of the
company and it does this
by employing the services
of an investment banks.
Investment banks
usually act as underwrit-
ers in the process, which
means that they would
offer to buy any un-sold
shares during the IPO.
Additionally, investment
banks would take a cut
of the funds raised by the
