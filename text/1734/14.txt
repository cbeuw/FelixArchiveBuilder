NATO Needs Replacing
NATO might be brain dead, but Macron just turned off the life support

ATO was
already creak-
ing. Everyone
could see it,
from congressmen in
the US tearing their hair
out at Trump’s tweets to
autocrats licking their
lips. But no one wanted
to say anything, because
the emperor’s clothes are
lovely until a child points
out that he is naked.
Macron is the allegorical
child. He has excitedly
pointed out what every-
one could already see but
chose not to mention and
is now looking around for
approval while the adults
run for cover.
NATO was always
somethingofapipedream.
Created as a way of deter-
ring Soviet aggression, it
only worked if everyone
was entirely committed
to the project. In the case
of an invasion of Western
Europe, Soviet tanks
would be rolling down
the Mall before American
troops were halfway
across the Atlantic.
However, the knowledge
that the consequences of
this would be an enthu-
siastic US response was
always enough of a de-
terrent. Everyone gained
as a result of this model.
The US could shore up
the vulnerable states of
Western Europe while
European nations were
able to outsource their
defence to America, in
the knowledge that there
was nothing they could
do when titans like the US
and the USSR clashed.
Like a pampered child,
Europe lost its calluses,
placing its faith in the soft
power of market forces to
drive global liberalisation
and turning its nose up at
the crass flag waving of
the US.
This is best seen
in the structure of the
EU, a common market,
tied together through
economic integration
rather than a political bloc
with common interests
and policies. The EU
developed in what it
thought were enlightened
ways, congratulating
themselves on the long
years of peace and social
progressiveness, forget-
ting the foundations upon
which that peace was built
on. The withdrawal of the
US from Europe threatens
to show up the European
project as an ivory tower
or a fat grub whose log
has been rolled away.
Criticising NATO is
nothing new for French
presidents who regularly
try to establish French
hegemony in Europe by
positioning themselves
as the rightful leader of
Europe rather than the
US. However, Macron’s
comments might just
have fired the starting
gun on the collapse of
this delicately balanced
scenario. Macron doesn’t
necessarily see this or
else he wouldn’t have
provided such a public
criticism of NATO. The
alternative to this, too
horrific to imagine, is that
he is trying to hasten its
collapse. Whatever the
case may be, the damage
is done. Why should
anyone trust an institu-
tion after it is shown to
have such major internal
divisions that one of its
top members publicly
criticises it?
Europe must face up to
the reality of a situation
where its integrity is not
guaranteed by America.
While his comments may
have been misjudged,
Macron is not badly
positioned as a potential
leader of Europe. Unlike
all the leaders of other
major nations of Europe,
he is strong domestically,
having consolidated
support after the gilets
jaunes protests, and has
proved himself to be
willing and able to act on
the world stage. His recent
state visit to China was
notable for how strongly
he tried to push European
interests, taking with
acceptable in any form.
Secondly, Macron’s
call for Europe to resist
China’s economic in-
fluence is easier for a
Frenchman to say than it
is for many of the other
nations of Europe. The
1989 EU arms embargo
on China, imposed after
the Tiananmen square
massacre, limited the
involvement of major
French defence tech
companies, and the dif-
ficult trading conditions
have led to a number of
French industrial groups
ceasing or scaling back
involvement with China.
This makes French com-
panies much less reliant
on Chinese exports than
Germany, whose more
consumer-goods-based
industry has pivoted
strongly towards China.
The core of his
message though is one
that European countries,
tied up at the moment
with internal matters,
need to hear: “The fat
years are over”. However,
even Macron’s proposed
military coordination
mechanisms do not go
far enough to fill the
gaps in missile defence,
air-to-air refuelling and
logistical support created
by a complete American
military withdrawal. It
will take strong leadership
to bring the recalcitrant
nations of Europe to heel
and to formulate a united
defence strategy in all
fields from AI to space.
While Macron might not
be the best person for the
job, he is possibly the
only one in the position
and with the vision to
persuade Europe to get
its hands dirty again and
do what is necessary to
protect our way of life.

him not only a French
business delegation but
also a German minister
of state and a European
Commissioner.
However, this is a far
cry from the joint Fran-
co-Germanic visit that
was proposed earlier this
year. The problem is that
while Macron’s proposals
sound good, they are often
still in the interests of
France. For example, his
argument that rapproche-
ment with Russia is nec-
essary terrifies the small
Baltic nations that are on
the front line of Russian
aggression. While Macron
is keen on a return to
realpolitik and the sacri-
ficing of these countries
to the Russian sphere of
influence in exchange for
cooperation, this would
not affect France but is not
