DramSoc Presents: Macbeth
S
hakespeare is the
eternal snake. Just
when you think
you have him
pinned down, he writhes
away, changes shape or
just turns to smoke in
your hands. His texts, so
well trod, in the hands of
successive centuries of
directors retain the ability
to shock generation after
generation.
Dramatists and actors
often cut their teeth on
Shakespeare. Ted Hughes,
one of the 20th century’s
most important British
poets, thought he was so
important that he memo-
rised Old Bill’s complete
works while working as a
lighthouse keeper, and his
neologisms have entered
common parlance. For
example, without Shake-
speare we would never
have been able to say
“fashionable eyeball”,
both being words that he
had coined.
This ﬂexibility of the
text is the reason that I
am so excited by the pro-
duction of Macbeth being
put on by DramSoc next
week. Directors Matthew
Last and Maddie Roche
have decided to focus
on the horriﬁc aspects of
the play, highlighting the
dark and difﬁcult lives
that the characters in
medieval Scotland led.
This is not a play about
kings and nobles ﬁghting
for what is right. Theirs
is a cold, hard and cruel
world where brutality,
more than anything else,
gets you ahead of your
competitors. Children are
killed out of hand for what
they might grow up to be
and battles are fought in
the cold mud, standing on
top of the corpses of those
that fell before you.
The supernatural
elements of the play,
often so uncomfortably
shoehorned into the plot,
make sense here. The
Scotland portrayed here is
used to magic. Everyday
events like the weather,
the health of livestock or
family members or crop
yields were the result of
a hundred mysterious
forces that could be
bargained with, ﬂattered,
and fought. Magic is an
everyday part of life here
in this Scotland. The
direction that the witches
themselves are taken, is
sure to shock. I will not
spoil the surprise here but
I promise that it will not
disappoint.
Lastand Roche’s vision
has extended to all parts of
the production. Audience
members can expect to
see paper crowns, thread-
bare clothes, and huge
furniture pieces that split
apart in an instant. They
never want to allow you to
forget that any impression
of greatness or majesty is
a lie. The wars of Macbeth
are fought over who gets
the right to bully the local
peasants into coughing
up what little they own in
tax. Kings change but life
in dark ages Scotland is
always short and hard.
Come and see Macbeth
next week Wednesday to
Saturday and I warn you.
Something wicked this
way comes.
