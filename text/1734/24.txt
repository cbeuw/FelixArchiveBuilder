Days of Abandon: shimmering sounds tinged with sad
mopery
I
n their third album,
Days of Abandon,
The Pains of Being
Pure at Heart almost
ditched their last album’s
heart bursting intensity.
Frontman Kip Berman,
once a starry-eyed “heart
on his sleeve” daydreamer
serenading anyone in
earshot, now sounds like
a young romantic who
has seen his share of
heartbreaks & the pains
of unrequited love. The
tracks on the album aren’t
about head-spinning,
chest-swelling love
anymore but now have
more complexities, com-
plications and none of the
naivety previously seen.
The band aren’t clamour-
ing for arena-rock status,
they’re just happy making
good music which shows
in the bookish & fuzzy
aesthetic of the album.
Moving away from the
bouncy ballad young love
found on their previous
album Belong, Days of
Abandon is subtler and
more graceful. The first
song on the album, ‘Art
Smock’ might just be the
most delicate song on the
album but more tellingly,
it’s easily the most nostal-
gic as well; a sweet-and-
sour remembrance of a
relationship-that-wasn’t.
The lyrics are sensitive
& sublime, and the hook
hits devastatingly close to
home but still feels tender:
“Should have guessed it
was going to fall/To pieces
in my hands again”. From
the very first notes, ‘Art
Smock’ feels more reflec-
tive and wistful. It’s a look
at the present through
the lens of the past, in
which Berman allows a
lived-in experience step
in and take over resulting
in untampered passion.
The next song ‘Simple
and Sure’ is bursting
with breezy and tight
arrangements, meditative
melodies, and beautifully
poignant lyricism, making
it a simultaneously boyish
and mature exploration
of love, longing and
everything in-between.
‘Life After Life’ lyrics:
“The flowers he gave me
have wilted/ But I keep
them, like I keep him”
tell us that not all love
lasts forever and most
dries up like flowers in
a vase—but with every
heartbreak comes a
well-earned lesson, a
souvenir to keep until the
next one comes along.
The next tracks ‘Coral
& Gold’, ‘Beautiful
You’, ‘Masokissed’ and
‘Until the Sun Explodes’
all feel like they have
some sort of wrinkles—
anxious memories, telling
recollections, none-too-
idyllic scenes from the
past—which are all over
Abandon. Berman’s cer-
tainly turned in sweeter,
more rousing sets, but he’s
neverwrittenanythingthat
feels quite so true to life.
On the first contact,
Abandon can come across
as muted and brittle but
musically, Abandon is
the fizziest Pains record
yet: say goodbye to the
plumes of distortion, and
instead, the album greets
you with records full of a
crisp, effervescent gallop,
that splits its time between
dreamy balladry and
spotless indie-pop. Days
of Abandon is the sound
of a young man in flux,
with Berman’s calling it
his most personal work
yet, and you can sense
that he has applied his life
lessons to the music from
writing about all the tiny
victories & painful heart-
breaks that come from
being young & in love.
Big Thief steal the top spot with ‘Not’
I
recently discovered
a a new personalized
playlist Spotify
creates called “On
Repeat”. As the name sug-
gests, this contains the 30
songs you’ve been playing
most over the last 30 days.
While this initially
served as a slightly un-
nerving reminder of the
reams of data I willingly
give to big tech, hopeful-
ly my current Springsteen
love in doesn’t lead to
suggested ads for Levis’
popping up, it also con-
firmed to me how much
I love the song ‘Not’.
‘Not’ is the lead single
from Big Thief’s new al-
bum Two Hands, and it’s
been stubbornly at the
top of my playlist for the
last month. One of the
band’s staples in live sets,
they’ve finally put down a
definitive hard-edged re-
cording.
The first half of the
track finds lead singer,
and songwriter, Adrianne
Lenker at her best: brutal-
ly poetic, “Not the meat of
your thigh/ Nor your spine
tattoo/ Nor the shimmery
eye” she shudders, per-
haps alluding to a pain
more spiritual than corpo-
real. Lenker’s voice fol-
lows a crescendo of rage,
moving from a quiver to
an impassioned howl by
the midpoint of the song,
at which point she un-
leashes an epic squalling
guitar solo that perfectly
carries the energy of her
vocal performance to the
end of the song, an end you
never really want to come.
‘Not’ is unlike any oth-
er song on Two Hands,
the second album released
by the band this year af-
ter UFOF dropped in
May. Most of the album
eschews the coarser in-
strumentation of ‘Not’ for
a simpler, folkier sound
which acts more as a plat-
form for Lenker’s lyrics.
The title track, ‘Two
Hands’ is a great exam-
ple of this. Lenker’s voice
hovers over the track, un-
picking the breakdown of
a relationship: “And the
more that we try/ To figure
through the answers/ to
repeat ourselves/ to deny,
deny”, while in between
chorus and verse a wispy,
electric squeal accompa-
nies the high pitched gui-
tar arpeggio. All of this
gives the track a rather
ethereal feel, an imper-
manence echoing perhaps
the fleeting nature of this
relationship for Lenker.
Elsewhere in the al-
bum Lenker also broach-
es broader topics, from
homelessness and belong-
ing in the earnest ‘Forgot-
ten Eyes’, to the gun crisis
in the more plaintive track
‘The Toy’.
Its these quietly raw
and empathetic songs
that heighten the impact
of ‘Not’, and the similar-
ly abrasive ‘Shoulders’,
creating the impression
that Big Thief are totally
in control of where they
want to go as a band, what
they want to explore and
how they want to explore
it. I expect ‘Not’ will sit
at the top of my “On Re-
peat” for a while yet...
