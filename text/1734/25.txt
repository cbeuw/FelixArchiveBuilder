MUSIC
I
have been following
Earl Sweatshirt’s
career religiously
since his 2015 pro-
ject I Don’t Like Shit, I
Don’t Go Outside. Sure,
I knew of him because
I was a fan of Tyler, The
Creator and Odd Future,
and I listened to tracks he
made that featured Frank
Ocean and Vince Staples,
but I initially became
a fan more for his dark
production than for his
lyricism (which was an
oversight looking back).
I was fascinated
by the musical ideas
that Earl presented in
IDLSIDGO. 2015 was
the start of my freshman
year of college at the
University of Washington
and as it goes, I became
increasingly stressed
throughout the year.
Listening to IDLSIDGO,
I was surprised at how
much the lyrics connected
with me on a personal
level. Before long I was
a huge Earl Sweatshirt
fan, eagerly awaiting his
next project. The short
project Solace released
later in 2015 was enough
to hold me over until
December 2018, when
Some Rap Songs dropped.
I treasured that project
from the start, falling in
love with the phenomenal
avant-garde post hip-hop
instrumentals. It was great
to hear Earl reconcile
himself, particularly on
my favourite track on
the album, ‘Azucar’.
After this release, I
was not expecting a new
project from Earl to come
any time soon. But then
he announced a surprise
EP called Feet of Clay. I
knew I had to listen to it as
soon as it dropped. That’s
“Earl brings
back his
signature
loose flow that
feels as though
it is both in
time and out
of sync”
what I did. I listened once,
I listened twice, I listened
10 times and I realised
hours had passed without
even feeling it. I was again
surprised by the instru-
mentals, which were even
more free form than Some
Rap Songs, especially on
‘EAST’, a track which
samples a classic Arabic
song. Earl brings back his
signature loose flow that
feels like it’s both on time
rhyme schemes, making
his voice a supplementary
instrument in and of itself.
The EP starts off strong
with ‘74’ where Earl talks
about how he has been
living since SRS whilst
taking shots at weak artists
and record label slaves.
The aforementioned
‘EAST’sees him speak on
his substance abuse and
how society nowadays
is obsessed with instant
gratification. He also
includes a great metaphor
about trying to extract
light from his stardom
but not being able to as
his star status is a result
of his dark lyrics. We get
Alchemist production on
‘MTOMB’ and it shows.
The beat is a fantastic
slow jazzy loop with soul
vocal samples layered
on top. Earl raps about
his father’s death on this
track whilst calling back
the classic Dizzee Rascal
album Boy in Da Corner.
Earl continues the theme
of loss on ‘OD’, rapping
about the loss of his friend
Mac Miller to an overdose.
On the next track, ‘EL
TORO COMBO MEAL’,
MAVI delivers a feature
with a more focused
style of rapping than Earl
Sweatshirt, which leads
me to an important point:
Earl has become so well
loved as a rapper that a
feature on his project at
this point lends significant
popularity. Indeed, MAVI
has rightfully gotten more
recognition since this EP
dropped, and the same can
be said for Mach-Hommy
for his feature on ‘4N’.
Earl has proclaimed that
Mach is his favourite
rapper (as opposed to MF
DOOM who was men-
tioned previously by Earl)
and he brings his A-game
on ‘4N’. That track, which
is the last of the album, and
‘TISK TISK/COOKIES’
both have instrumentals
very typical of the lo-fi,
abstract hip-hop subgenre
that Earl has pioneered
(see artists such as MIKE,
Medhane and Slauson
Malone, as well as MAVI
and Mach-Hommy).
All in all, I really
enjoyed this project and
I am definitely going to
keep listening to it for a
very long time. I strongly
recommend this EPto Earl
Sweatshirt fans. To people
who have never tried out
any of Earl Sweatshirt’s
music, I suggest starting
with I Don’t Like Shit, I
Don’t Go Outside first to
see how you like it and if
you do, I encourage you
to listen to the rest of his
discography.
