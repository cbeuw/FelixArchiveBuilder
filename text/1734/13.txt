F
elix published an
article recently,
highlighting how
China exerts
its economic muscle to
manipulate the behaviour
of companies and cajole
them into turning a blind
eye to many human rights
abuses; in return, allow-
ing businesses’ access to
the large Chinese market,
shamelessly forgoing
ethics in pursuit of profit.
Unfortunately this
moral problem of abate-
ment & appeasement
is not only confined
to companies but over
the years has extended
to countries as well.
Beijing has been able
to coerce and apply
political and economic
pressure to countless
sovereign nations.
In July, 22 mainly
Western countries
issued a joint statement
to the United Nations
Human Rights Council
denouncing the ongoing
flagrant human rights
abuses in the Xinjiang
region of China, the
home to ethnic Turkic
Uighur people, in a
brazen attempt to erase
Uighur populations
distinct culture and
Muslim heritage, by
forcing them to assimi-
late to what the govern-
ment sees as superior
Hans Chinese culture.
It is estimated between
three to four million
Uighurs have been
imprisoned into intern-
ment camps and there
have been widespread
horrifying accounts of
Uighurs being subjected
to systematic human
rights abuses from
inhumane and degrading
medical experiments,
mass sterilisation,
gang rape, mental and
barbaric physical torture
resulting to unconfirmed
number of deaths. In
response to the letter,
37 countries wrote
a rebuttal defending
China; not surprisingly
most of these countries
had substantial inflow
of Chinese investments
worth up to several
billion of dollars. Any
dissent and failure by
these countries to toe the
line, could easily lead
to Beijing withdrawing
their investments at a
moment’s notice. Last
week China warned
the US that criticism of
Uighur ‘detentions’ is
not ‘helpful’ for trade
talks between their
countries.
Beijing’s PR
machine argues that
the internment camps
are for ‘re-education’
and to wipe out signs
of extremism, which
it defines as anything
including but not limited
to praying, fasting,
uttering the Islamic
greeting “As-salamu
alaykum” (meaning
peace be upon you)
or just having a short
or hipster style beard.
Uighur toddlers have
been forcibly snatched
away from their families
and placed into crowded
orphanages run by
the communist party;
Beijing hopes these
young children will one
day grow up having no
idea about their Uighur
identity. Just this week
it has been reported
Muslim women have
been ‘forced to share
beds’ with male Chinese
officials after their
husbands are detained in
camps.
Anyone defending
these cruel and inhumane
practices wherever they
take place in the world
need to think careful-
ly before defending
the indefendable and
becoming a mouthpiece
of oppressive govern-
ments. Just imagine
how you would feel if
this were to happen to
your mother, father or
close family? I hope
my Chinese friends and
friends from other parts
of the world understand
this point and take the
opportunity to experi-
ence living away from
home in a free society
away from closely
controlled environment
where they have grown
up in and realise what
is happening in some
countries is not the norm
and is unacceptable.
