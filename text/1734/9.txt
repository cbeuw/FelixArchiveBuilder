Adiós, Evo

M
ore than
a n y t h i n g
else, the his-
tory of Latin
America is a history of
change. Its collection of
revolutions, coups, elec-
tions, interventions and
civil wars is long enough
to keep even the most vo-
racious historian busy, so
it’s with an uneasy sense
of déjà vu that Bolivia
says goodbye to its long-
est-ever serving president,
Evo Morales. His 14-year
tenure came to an abrupt
end on Monday, when
he was advised by the
police and military to step
down “to restore peace
and stability” after his
controversial re-election
in October. At the time of
writing, Morales is in po-
litical asylum in Mexico,
and the exact nature of
the political situation back
home is unclear.
Who is Evo, though?
Morales was first elected
back in 2006 as the head
of the Movement towards
Socialism (MAS) party,
on a strong anti-neolib-
eral, pro-indigenous and
pro-worker platform.
Known nationally as a
trade unionist for coca leaf
growers, he was lauded as
being the first native pres-
ident in Bolivia’s history,
being of the Aymara eth-
nicity. He found himself
at the helm of the poorest
country in the continent,
with an illiteracy rate of
16% and absolute poverty
levels in excess of 35%,
and sought primarily to
divert the massive profits
earned by extraction of
natural resources back
to the people. The MAS
oversaw the effective na-
tionalisation of hydrocar-
bon industries, increasing
coca leaf farmers led the
DEA to accuse Morales of
supporting the narcotics
trade, and his govern-
ment’s close relationships
with Cuba, Nicaragua and
Venezuela were causes for
concern for Washington,
which has tended histor-
ically to frown upon too
much anti-imperialism in
its southern neighbours.
It’s with this history
in mind that we come
to the recent unrest, and
indeed unseating, in
Bolivia. On 20th October
Morales won his third
re-election, but the result
was immediately disputed
and declared void by
internal and external
observers - most notably
by the Organisation of
American States (OAS),
who reported finding
“clear manipulations” in
the ballots. Upon receiv-
ing the report, Morales
called fresh elections
but the protests that had
formed soon enjoyed the
support of the police, the
opposition, and eventually
the army: the embattled
president had no choice
but to back down per their
‘request’.
The coup has prompted
much speculation. Some
observers noted that
in the weeks prior to
his removal, Morales
declared void a contract
with a German corpora-
tion to mine Bolivia’s rich
lithium reserves on the
basis that the deal didn’t
provide enough benefits
for locals. Given that the
country is estimated to
contain at least 30% of the
world’s lithium supply,
and considering its im-
portance in the production
of batteries, many see
an incentive in opening
up Bolivia’s reserves
for easier exploitation.
Others see the ousting as
a bolstering for the US’
influence in the Andes
amid increasing social
unrest in the area, possibly
cementing Bolivia as a
country friendly to its
interests in the same vein
as Colombia, Chile and
Brazil. On the other hand,
people have argued that
leaders of the left in Latin
America often become
stagnant in their wedding
to power, as perhaps in
the case of Nicaragua’s
Daniel Ortega. The true
nature of these events
will only become clear in
time. For the moment, an
interim government led by
Senate vice-leader Jeanine
Áñez has 90 days to call
new elections according
to the constitution, and no
doubt spectators the world
over – including Morales
himself – will be watching
with bated breath.
As the dust settles after a Bolivian coup, we look back on 14 years of “Evismo”
Bolivia’s earnings from
the sector eight-fold
overnight. These earnings
materialised as improved
infrastructure and were
consolidated by extensive
social reforms, aiming
to elevate the status
of women, indigenous
groups and peasants.
The fruits of the MAS’
labours came in the form
of the eradication of
illiteracy within 3 years
and a halved poverty rate
alongside consistently
strong economic growth.
Importantly, these encour-
aging indicators came
despite Morales’ staunch
refusal to cooperate with
the IMF or World Bank,
thus demonstrating for
many the possibility of
total autonomy from
global neoliberalism for
developing countries.
Ideologically, Morales
always positioned himself
as a socialist but the extent
to which he carried this
through is disputed. His
government allowed mul-
tinational corporations to
continue their operations
in Bolivia for the most
part, as long as they did
so “legally”. Furthermore,
although his cabinets
were filled with indige-
nous people and women
after each election cycle,
they tended to become
more traditional and
homogenous as time went
on, with many citing this
as evidence of Morales’
skin-deep radicalism.
However, one of the more
interesting aspects of his
governing ideology, af-
fectionately referred to as
“Evoism”, was its focus
on traditional indigenous
styles of government. For
example, land reform was
organised on a strictly
communitarian basis, with
farmland being distributed
to traditional communities
rather than to individuals.
In addition, the teaching
of native languages like
Quechua and Aymara in
schools was made man-
datory, and attendance
of indigenous people in
education was encouraged
– now, more than half of
students in university are
of indigenous heritage.
Of course, it hasn’t
all been smooth sailing.
Morales came under par-
ticularly heavy fire in 2014
when he campaigned for
the abolition of presiden-
tial term limits, leading
critics to accuse his gov-
ernment of autocratic be-
haviour. He claimed that
more time was needed to
deliver the promises of
his previous campaigns,
but this constitutional
amendment formed the
setup for the crises of the
past few weeks. Through-
out his tenure the most
vehement criticism came,
unsurprisingly, from the
United States: his fighting
for the rights of traditional
