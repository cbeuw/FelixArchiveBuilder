Death of a Salesman is
often hailed as one of the
best plays of the 20th cen-
tury. Adding to its fame,
the play recently made the
news when the roof of the
theatre ‘collapsed’ on the
audience twenty minutes
into the show, a mere
48 hours after my own
viewing.
Death of a Salesman
chronicles the ascending
to madness of Willy
Loman, a failing salesman
(of an unknown product)
from New England who is
plagued with disappoint-
ment; in himself, in his
son Biff, in life itself.
Directed by Marianne
Elliott and Miranda
Cromwell, the production
is absolutely stunning
from start to end. The
transitions between the
flashbacks and real-time
are beautifully orchestrat-
ed, flowing naturally and
blending into one another
at just the right moments.
The lighting plays a big
part in this, which, on the
whole, is perfect, reflect-
ing the mood of the play
throughout, changing and
developing as the charac-
ters and the plot do too.
Making the creative
decision to centre the play
around an African-Amer-
ican family really pays
off. The core message of
the script is still intact,
however, some lines
acquire deeper meaning
and relevance thanks to
this switch. Although the
script is true to Miller’s
original, blending it with
Jazz and Gospel music,
genres associated with
the African-American
culture, added further
authenticity to this new
version.
Acting is also overall
very strong, particular-
ly from the Suits star
Wendell Pierce who
portrays a desperate,
delusional Willy Loman.
Sharon D. Clarke proves
why she is currently one
of the most acclaimed
actresses on the West End
once again, performing
the role of Linda Loman,
the loving wife, riveting
and extremely real.
So, why did I leave
the show feeling a bit let
down? Especially during
the second act, I found
myselfcheckingmyclock,
wondering how much
longer they would take
to wrap things up. With
a runtime of three hours,
it’s difficult for a play to
not feel long. However,
I felt that the script was
often circling around the
same points and taking
too long to reach any real
conclusions.
Overall, Death of a
Salesman is pretty darn
great. Despite the of-
ten-long-winded ways the
script ops to tell its story,
it is staged so brilliantly in
all aspects which makes
for a mostly thrilling night
at the theatre. Just be
mindful of the ceiling.
The Music of the Night
I
n theatrical perfor-
mances, the orchestra
has a supporting
function, often
lacking the appreciation
that it deserves. In this
one-night-only show
of hit songs from the
most famous musicals,
the orchestra is on stage
alongside the singers, as
opposed to being in the pit.
This unusual arrangement
gives a twist to the songs,
creating a unique con-
cert. With musical stars
like Richard Balcombe,
Louise Dearman, Celinde
Schoenmaker, Ben
Forster, Alex Guarmond,
Bonnie Langford and
the Royal Philharmonic
Orchestra sharing the
spotlight, it was a cele-
bration of musicals. The
whole performance was
filled with lighthearted-
ness and warmth, mainly
due to the humour and
fun with which Langford
presented it and to the old
companionship between
the singers.
Forster’s performances
spotlighted his exception-
al vocal range, showing
off the variety of his vo-
cal traits from his delicate
and tender low notes to
the clear and sharp high
notes. These dynamics
allowed him to fully con-
vey the range of the char-
acters’ emotions in each
song. “Defying Gravity”,
sung by Dearman, was
another remarkable per-
formance which brought
emotion and shivers to the
stage and the auditorium,
enhanced the atmosphere
and made the audience
feel immersed in the con-
cert itself.
The orchestra per-
formed flawlessly and
harmoniously, with their
classical arrangements
of ABBA Medley and
Queen’s “Don’t Stop Me
Now” being unusual and
delightful at the same
time. The choir, formed of
students at the Italia Conti
Academy of Theatre Arts,
lightened the stage with
their active choreography.
The canon - a sequence of
the same movement per-
formed at different times
by multiple performers -
added excitement and en-
ergy, expressing their joy
for performing. We were
especially excited to see
the young singers our age
on stage.
Unfortunately, some
asynchrony between the
singers and musicians
prevented the concert
from rising to its full po-
tential. The choir sped up
unexpectedly in “Step in
Time”, which made the
audience restless and una-
ble to focus on their sing-
ing. In addition, the or-
chestra’s powerful sound
drowned out the voices of
the soloists and hindered
their performances mul-
tiple times. Microphones
were also not always
turned on in time for the
soloists, which felt slight-
ly unprofessional. Per-
haps this was due to insuf-
ficient rehearsal, it being
on for just a single night.
The Music of the Night
is part of the Royal Phil-
harmonic Orchestra Series
which sees the Royal Phil-
harmonic starring in mul-
tiple concerts at the Roy-
al Albert Hall till October
next year. A fun night
which took fans and new-
comers alike through the
most cherished and em-
blematic productions of
musical theatre. Though
there was room for tech-
nical improvement, the
originality of the concept,
radiance of the Royal
Philharmonic and joy of
the performers created a
memorable event worthy
of more than just a one-
night show.
