orget that ‘animal,
v e g e t a b l e ,
mineral’ game
you might have
played as a kid on long
car journeys, plants can
do one better – they can
tell exactly who is eating
them.
It is not news that plants
possess the ability to share
information about what
bird or beast is causing
them damage, emitting a
bouquetofvolatileorganic
compounds (VOCs) in
response to an attack. A
recipient plant can then
interpret variations of
these chemical bouquets
as detailed warnings about
the identity of the attacker
and initiate the appropriate
defence mechanism; for
example, by producing
chemicals that repulse
those munching down or
that attract a higher-level
predator to the site.
Indeed, this is a
sophisticated system –
but scientists have so
far struggled to explain
why and how this
communication system
has developed: until
now. Recent research
from Cornell University,
published in Current
Biology, has identified
for the first time a mutual
benefit for both the
recipient and sender plant
in this communication
and uncovered important
clues tracing back its
evolutionary origins.
The team’s research
focus is explained by Dr.
André Kessler from the
Department of Ecology
and Evolutionary Biology
at Cornell. “VOCs have
been known for a while
to act in that role. But
what is not clear is how
important it is to the plant;
Caterpillar, butterfly, or insect?

Evolutionary origins of how plants recognise their predators, plus plant-talk as an information sharing model
is it functional? Does it
have any effect on plant
fitness? What is the benefit
to the (sender) plant?”
He describes a situation
where a leaf located on
one side of the plant
comes under attack by
herbivores, and releases
VOCs to communicate to
a leaf on the opposite side
of the plant to save itself
from further damage. In
this case, there is a clear
benefit to the sender
plant. However, this
signal can be hijacked
by other nearby plants,
and so the true cost to the
sender is giving away its
competitive advantage; by
sounding the alarm, a plant
is giving its competitor
a head-start in the fight
for survival. “This open

communication is like
‘eavesdropping’ on
neighbouring plants”,
Kessler says.
To explore this further,
the team investigated two
hypotheses to understand
why plants might accept
this cost; one of kin
selection, where plants
emitted a VOC bouquet
that could only be
understood by plants
of the same genotype
(with shared DNA),
and a second of mutual
benefit, where plants used
‘open messages’, thereby
allowing non-genetically-
related plants to interpret
the signal.
The team found that
the plants responded
more strongly to VOC
messages from related
than non-related plants –
the competitive advantage
was preferentially given to
plants that carry the same
DNA, supporting the kin
selection hypothesis. But
the answer wasn’t that
simple. To examine the
evolutionary selection
pressures that influence
VOC emission, the
team used two sets of
plants: those that had
never been exposed to
herbivore attack in the
past (herbivoire naive),
and those that had.
They found that while
the herbivore naïve plants
kept to private channel
VOC warnings (ie.
those targeted at related
plants), plants with prior
herbivore exposure shared
their warning signals
more widely on an open
communication channel.
Kessler explains that
the presence of herbivore
selection pressure forced
them to “converge on the
same language, [whereas]
we showed that if you
remove one agent of
selection (herbivores), it
makes the other (plant-
plant competition) more
important”.
So, does this support the
mutual benefit hypothesis
instead? “What I would
say is we’re reconciling
extremes of the same
continuum, right?”
Kessler reasons.
He explains that, in
animals, whether the
communication channel is
open or closed is defined
by the social system. for
instance, animals in social
groups communicate
more openly and share
the cost and benefit of
warning signals, as they
depend on the group for
survival. Solitary animals
would not gain any
benefit from providing a
competitive advantage to
a competitor that they do
not rely on for survival.
However, in plants, the
factors affecting the
choice of open or closed
communication channels
are not clear - this research
provides valuable insight
into this.
The team’s next
research plans to define
the balance between
these two hypotheses
and the open/closed
channels - is there a point
at which plants switch to
“The presence
of herbivore
selection
pressure forced
the plants to
converge on the
same language”
favouring one over the
other? Is there a threshold
population number where
open communication
channels are selected for,
or a degree of genetic
similarity where private
channels are preferred?
This discovery
also opens up other
research avenues, such
as use of the plant-plant
communication as a model
of information sharing,
and even harnessing the
VOC communication
system for natural pest
control. Recently, the
Cornell University team
helped develop a push-
pull pest control technique
in Kenyan small-hold
farms, manipulating
VOC messaging to
alternatively repel (push)
and attract (pull) pests
away from crop plants.
By clever placement
of these push and pull
plants around farmer’s
fields, the valuable crop
can be safeguarded from
pests without needing
pesticides.
Ultimately, this
study advances our
understanding of why
a plant sends warning
messages and the factors
affecting how they
are sent; the next big
breakthrough lies in
discovering how these
messages are read and
interpreted by receiver
plants. The biosynthetic
pathways leading to the
emission of VOCs is well-
understood, but exactly
how a plant recognises
these chemicals – and is
able to differentiate to the
precision of caterpillar,
butterfly, or insect –
remains unknown.
The question we are left
with then is how a plant
detects a VOC bouquet.
Or as Kessler puts it: how
plants smell!
