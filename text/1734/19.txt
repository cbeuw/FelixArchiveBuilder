La Chinoise (1967)
Over 50 years after its initial release, Jean-Luc Godard’s La Chinoise still stands as a drastically important piece in
the director’s catalogue, albeit a transitional one.
A
s an after-
thought to this
review, earlier
this year I read
an Ali Smith book called
‘Public Library and Other
Stories’. While (slightly)
irrelevant to the book, the
cover featured a shot of
two people reading on a
balcony with strong red,
white, and blue colours
dominating the frame. On
the back of the book it
had the pictured credited
as a still from Jean-Luc
Godard’s La Chinoise. I
hadn’t made the conscious
effort to immediately set
out and watch it, but in
coming to review this
film, the link reappeared
in my mind; it wasn’t a
direct influence, however
I thought it was a nice
detail, and much like the
film, I would highly rec-
ommend the book.
In 1967, the French
strikes of 1968 were just
around the corner, where
Godard made an almost
prophetic feature follow-
ing a group of Maoist
students meaning to start
a revolution through
terrorist violence; based
loosely on Dostoyevsky’s
‘Demons’, we follow
5 students living in
an (away-from-home)
friend’s flat, dwelling on
this revolution they dream
of.
Taking influence from
one of Dostoyevsky’s
masterworks, we can
expect the story to be
devilishly cohesive and
darkly funny, however
many a film has fallen
short with brilliant source
material. Not this one.
As is consistent with his
other work, Godard’s
exceptional dialogue
between characters takes
centre stage as we’re
forced into reflection
through heavy themes of
philosophy and politics.
Breaking from traditional
storytelling, Godard often
breaks the conventional
method, dropping into
an almost documentary
style interview; we’re
seamlessly flowing
between these interviews
with the students and
what is reality. However,
the authenticity of these
students is often brought
into question when we
look at the scenes as a
whole.
“They pride
themselves
on their
bohemian
lifestyle,
yet sit in an
immaculate
bourgeois flat”
“This dark
comedy serves
as a beautiful
film in the
catalogue of
Godard”
The first thing you
notice about this film
are the colours. The red,
white, and blue (of the
revolution) feature in
almost every shot, with
immaculately designed
frames and a casual
camera movement, the
almost sterile nature of
these perfect colours lend
itself to a sort of falseness,
an inauthenticity. They
pride themselves on their
bohemian and leftist
lifestyle, yet sit in the
immaculately bourgeois
apartment, talking of
revolution while sitting
with decadent furnish-
ings. This is of course
no accident, and neither
are the colours. About
midway through, we
get a quote from Kirilov
(Lex De Bruijn) “Blue,
yellow, red. Perfectly
pure, perfectly balanced.
Perfect on the pretext
that every other colour is
there.” Almost every shot
featured is heavily blue,
red and, white; could it be
that something is missing
from these frames? The
balancing of the yellow
should be just as impor-
tant, yet we see little of
it. It comes at times, seen
in jumpers and the occa-
sional lamp, but perhaps
things are not as perfectly
balanced in this radical
group’s ideologies as they
seem to think.
They take turns to
give their take on the
philosophy, preaching to
the group with brilliantly
eloquent passages of
dialogue, persuasive
and polarising. Talking
in terms of science and
experiment, they blend
their philosophical ideals
with fact, but still there’s
this underlying comedy.
With the flat’s walls over
excessively lined with
‘The Little Red Book’ in
an almost over-compen-
satory fashion, we begin
to wonder whether the
students are genuinely
concerned with the cause
they so passionately speak
of. As if to show that they
do in-fact care, Veronique
(Anne Wiazemsky) sets
out to murder the Minister
of Culture of the Soviet
Union, yet in doing so ac-
cidently shoots the wrong
person; this about sums up
the effectiveness of their
revolution.
One of the best scenes
in the film comes towards
the end (before the
assassination) where Ve-
ronique has a scintillating
conversation with Francis
Jeanson (as played by
himself) about her radical
plans to kick start a rev-
olution. (Jeanson being a
notorious political activist
at the time, famous
through his commitment
to the National Liberation
Front during the Algerian
war). The conversation
goes as a debate between
Veronique and Jeanson,
each with opposing views
on whether the terrorist
kick start of the revolu-
tion is the morally just
one. It is rumoured that
Godard had fed lines to
Wiazemsky through an
earpiece for this scene, so
it was essentially Godard
debating with Jeanson,
perhaps lending to the
brilliance of it.
Overall, this dark
comedy serves as a
beautiful film in the cat-
alogue of Godard, with
a witty and astute social
commentary to back. Its
predictive nature and the
precedence set after its
release, perhaps garnered
it more attention than
would have naturally pro-
ceeded, but the brilliance
in it is precisely that. The
insight to comment on
the increasingly leftist
view in France at the time
leaves you to wonder
whether the film itself had
any effect on the events of
the next year, but for me,
it was a beautiful film that
has clearly had a large in-
fluence on directors of the
modern age (I’m looking
at you Wes Anderson et
al.) with a relative and
meaningful politically
commentary that we can
still look at today.
