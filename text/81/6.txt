The 1 s t . U fielding an experlaental aide Includ-
ing seven freshers.made an Inauspicious start to tha
season by losing 17-9 to L.S.E. We are meeting L.S.B.
again this week and we intend to erase the memory
of this defeat. On Oot. 15th.Wasps Vandals turned
Cut a very strong side and we lost 27-3, This gaas
pinpointed our weaknesses: 1) failure to go for the
b a l l i n loose scrums; 11) Ragged line out play,and
i l l ) Weak tackling by the backs. Efforts have been
•ade to iron out these weaknesses with t a c t i c a l
talks and practices i n the park.
Last week brought a change i n fortune. We d i s -
posed of Borough Rd. 17-0 with tries scored by
Doncaster.O'Frail,Palmer and Hearn,who also kicked
a penalty and one conversion. On Saturday we t r a v e l -
led to Kxeter College,Oxford,who were duly beaten
30-0. This game showed a certain amount of improve-
ment on previous gaaes,but there were periods when
there was no team work at all.Try scorers ware
"right 2 .itaull 2,Toynbee, Doneaster and Beam 2,
who also converted three of the tries.
The other teams a l l Dads a good start,pride
of place going to the 2nd.and Ex.A who won 55-0 and
62-0 respectively,thus beating the previous club
record of 52-0 set up by Dsn's team l a s t year.
Against Wasps the A team won with only fourteen men,
a vary creditable performance.
We are playing Kings i n the f i r s t round of the
U.L. Cup on Wednesday Nov.9th. The players concerned
are doing their utmost to ensure a victory, We ask
a l l other members of the club to do their b i t by

HOCKEY
The Hockey Club began the season on Saturday
October 15th. The f i r s t and second elevens lost
to the Old Dunstablians 3-1 and 4-0 respectively,
and the t h i r d eleven were beaten 3-1 by Hampstead
fourth. On Saturday October 22nd, flic f i r s t
eleven were beaten 3-1 and the second eleven drew
3-3 with Ashford.
Several promising freshers have .joined the
club. These include S.Morland, J.Buckworth,
L.Mahmoud, and C.Turner. We wish these and a l l
freshers a- happy and successful season.
Two members of the club, P.Mantle and E,
Owen are playing f o r the University side, and
helped to defeat Oxford 4-3.
Rumour has i t that the Hockey Club i s t o
acquire a secret weapon i n the near future, as
warden of the Hostel i s thought to have been
secretly p r a c t i s i n g Hockey i n his soundproofed
apartmenta.
CROSS-COUNTRY
The prospects f o r t h i s season are bright at
the moment. We have been fortunate i n finding a
number of good freshers, notably Chas C o t t e r l l l ,
which probably accounts f o r our successes'so f a r .
The Annual Mob Matbh against Pearl Assurance warn
won convincingly, I.C. having the f i r s t f i v e men
home, l e d by Pain and C o t t e r i l l . In the Univers-
i t y v. Polytechnic Harriers match and the Univer-
sity t r a i l s we had the largest turnout of any
Oollege, and d i d very v e i l i n bath. Mailer and
Barber are to be congratulated especially f o r
finely-judged running which has probably earned
them places i n the University second team. The
same two l e d the f i e l d home f o r a resounding win
against Royal Naval College, Greenwich, at
Petersham nine days ago.
SQUASH
the
I.C.W.S.C. HOCKEY
Chelsea Poly; We won 3-2
Queen Elisabeth College: We drew 3-3
These r e s u l t s compare very favourably watn
the corresponding ones l a s t seasoa, the improve-
ment being due to the fresher part of the team,
especially Rosemary Stone, who has scored four
of the goals i n our two matches.
After a much improved record last year the
club i s looking forward to a successful season.
Four eld colours man are s t i l l here and with tha
addition of at least two promising freshers the
1st. 7 should be even stronger than last year.

match against U.L.W.S.R.C. and tha second against
R.N.B.C., Plymouth, who included i n their team,
