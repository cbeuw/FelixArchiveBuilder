Friday October the 21st. saw that great annual
function, which has been going on for many years,
when the man of the H.S.M. welcome their new com-
rades In most f i t t i n g style which Is unequalled by
any other college or mining school In the World.
STen those who cams away from the Dinner who were
sober, and there were very few, thoroughly enjoyed
themselves.
As i s usual on this occasion, hosts were meeting
their freshers upto an hour and a half before tha
dinner was due to begin, and they than made haste
to the Queen's Arms, or similar hostelry, keen to
commence the business of the evening. "The Queen's"
was packed almost as tight as some of i t s occupants
were fated to become.
She Dinner began at 7.30 i n the Ayrton Hall. I t
• was to go on for over two hours,during which time
an excellent Mooney-produced meal,swilled down by
vast quantities of bitter beer, and s i x sagacious
speeches were consumed. The President, Mr. Huckin,
was the f i r s t to spaak after the Queen had been
toasted, and he rose to his feet to propose the
toast "The Freshers". Bus to the fact that FELIX
correspondents are never really sober anyway, and
on this occasion definitely not so, we cannot r e -
member what Mr.Huckin said - except something about
Clarwence, Horwace and the Zoo. A l l s i x speeches,
as one would expect, consisted mainly of verbal
mutual back-slapping. Mr.Doug Owen replied for the
Freshers. In a s t i r r i n g speech he righteously con-
demned " that place along Exhibition Road with a
doorway looking l i k e tha entrance to a Public Lav-
atory." Mr. Owen then led his fellows i n a toast
to their hosts. At the end of his speech he was
accorded tumultuous applause. Mr. Tony Werner, the
Vice-President, next rose to propose the toast
"The Royal School of Mines". He examined the R.S.
M. In the light of the past, the present, and the
future, and gave some witty definitions regarding
the various professions within the mining industry.
The Head of the Mining Department, Professor Mlt-
cheson than replied to this toast saying that he
was honoured that, he had been asked to do so cons-
idering that only a few years ago he had bean " a
fresher " himself. Professor Mitcheson went on to
speak of the traditions of, and the benefits to be
gained from the School. He spoke, too, of the high
reputation of the School i n the mining industry
throughout the World.
The last two speeches ware tha proposal of a toast
to the Guests, by Peter Orialey, P.G. Mining Geology,
and the reply, by Mr. H.H.Blyth, a lecturer i n the
Mineral Dressing Department. Mr. Orimloy was rathmr
rude to Messrs. M i l l e r and Guthrie and pointed out to
the former that he now had the opportunity of seeing
how a freshers <Jlnn«r should be run.
With the speeches over, the company repaired to the
Bar and ejected those non-R.S.M."scura" who had not
already fled. But the President announced that the
Yard was not to be drunk on the Bar counter as i s
usual; i t was to be drunk on the steps outside tho
door of the Bar. Half way through these proceedings
one unfortunate gentleman, i n swirling the Yard to
prevent airlock, h i t somebody's head three feet away.
This Jarred the rim of the funnel against the un-
fortunates teeth which were strong enough to chip
the glass. Tho Hon.Pornographer's Pot was substit-
uted, a pint of ale being measured into i t . I t was
not quite clear to your reporters as to who won the
Yard, but the freshers put up a very good show.
The company returned to the Bar proper as i t near-
ed eleven o'clock. The previously ejected Guildsmen
and R.C.S. were courteously permitted to coexist.
A l l were Joinad i n merry songs, the names of which
FKi.Il readers w i l l have l i t t l e d i f f i c u l t y i n guess-
'^•g. then the Bar closed there was an exodus to the
adjoining lounge where Mr. Wallace, one of the two
Honourable Pomographers, read the l i t t l e bedtime
story of "Eskimo Nell" from the Mines Book. At this
f i n a l stage i n the proceedings Keith Miller began
to complain b i t t e r l y that "Nell" had to be read from
a book and was not recited frons memory. This does
seem to be rather a poor show and the only excuse
that comes to mind i s that, after drinking the near-
l y three pints of his f u l l Pot i n one f e l l swoop,
the Pornographor's memory may have become clouded
over.

This year for the first time, City and Guilds College
had an official reception for their freshmen. There were
four freshers dinners where each new man had an 'old hand'
as his host. Guilds Union Freshers Dinner Committee are to
be eongratu&lated on their extremely rapid and efficient
handling of the arrangement. It was no slight task to
designate hosts, contact guests, prepare speeches, search
for stories (dean or otherwise), look to catering and beer
(clean or otherwise!J) in the'space of only three days, but
the committee of twenty did their work well,
Keith Miller, aa acting president of the College, had
the unenviable ta3k of making two speeches per dinner.
Thinking to enlighten his task by introducing a little
novelty, he wrote his speeches on toilet paper. This went
off excellently far the first two occasions, but on the third
night the prinoipal guest turned out to be a director of a
rival toilet-paper firm.
Professor Ford not wishing to be scandalised by the
stories of his past bought his piece of toilet paper at the
price of a 2nd class degree. However The Dean in the
presence of the fro-Reotar, on the following night was blaok-
mailed more successfully, to the tune of a 1st.
A main source of anxiety was whether one's fresher would
think that the evening's entertainment included free beer.
Several people were overheard telling their proteges that i t
was the custom for the guest to pay for the host's drinks
after the dinner.
The singing of traditional songs in the bar was admir-
ably led, after a few fal3e starts, by Mr. Miller. After
the first verse of "The Engineer", more than a few startled
faces were observed. These, however, due to the atmosphere
and the free beer, 30on disappeared, and we were oheered to
find this year's first-year men just as good as last
year's.
One emminent guest stayed in the bar drinking double
whiskies until 11.JO and paying for all the rounds. However
the night porter was a little bleary eyed by then and wishing
to go to sleep was heard to says
"Now then move on out otherwise I will report you to the
Chairman of the C. & G. Board."
The reply was:
"My go-oooood man. I a
m the Chairman." The Chairman
was last seen dancing down Exhibition Road.
It i s sad to report that by Friday night K. Miller was
slightly intoxicated after a week of ordeals and was confused
when trying to distinguish several guests, however that night
brought to an end a very successful venture and the good
secretary Mr. Peter Harri3 laid Mr.
his bed to f a l l
blissfully asleep.
However he i s in working order again and this week he
hopes all hosts will pay up the remaining 22/- to their
departmental reps so that the bills may be met. J

The Wine Tasting Society, newly formed i n the
College, sent out invitations to Union O f f i c i a l s
of a l l ranks and classes to "partake i n the tasting
to be held i n the new lounge on Friday 14th Oct.
at 5.15 p.m." Mr. Ian Mackenzie, the well known
wine importer, spoke on the subject of sherry. His
t a l k , as one would expect, was extreaely well i n -
formed and interesting, i f a l i t t l e dry.
The t a s t i n g of the wine began about an hour
after the meeting began, by which time a great and
insatiable t h i r s t had been created i n the l i s t e n e r s .
Mr. Mackenzie answered questions on the wines and
t h e i r uses, and when the meeting was brought to a
close most people wanted more to taste.
The c r i t i c i s m which i s levelled at the Society
organizers i s a matter of p r i n c i p l e . There were
many i n v i t a t i o n s sent out, and no mention was
nade of payment: But i n order to taste the wine
everybody had to pay two shillings.. I f such
remuneration was expected, patrons should have been
rorwarnea, I t i s bad taste on the part of the
Society. .
