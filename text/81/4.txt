In 1954 the Senate of the University of Lonr
don passed a resolution as follows:-
"... the Metropolitan Police ... are not prepared
to give f a c i l i t i e s f o r or protection to any pro-
cession or demonstrations on November 5th. A stu-
dent who i s found to have taken part i n any form
of procession on 5th. November next, or otherwise
misbehaved himself or herself, w i l l be l i a b l e to
appear before a College Board of Discipline ....
Any student ... who takes part i n such a c t i v i t i e s
i s l i a b l e to be sent down ... either temporarily
or permanently".
This i s the second successive year that stu-
dents of the University have been issued with a
stern r u l i n g from. Senate House. I t has been brought
about by deeds of hooliganism caused by a few i r r -
esponsible people who treat a large gathering of
students as a cover to acts of wanton and unnec-
essary damage. The climax was reached i n 1953 when
on November 6th. Bow Street Magistrates' Court was
the scene of a continuous procession of students
appearing f o r t h e i r "crimes" of the preceeding
evening.
LETS PLAY AT
BEING GOOD BOYS
THIS YEAR
The students of Imperial College, f u l l y aware
of the foundations on which the Senate based t h e i r
decision, accepted t h e i r ruling and provided t h e i r
own amusement on the sports f i e l d at Harlington.
For some years Harlington has provided an outlet
for Kov. 5th but last years effort was carried
out on a grander side, i n order to keep our stu-
dents from trespassing on the newly formed Senate
laws. The Entertainments committee i n conjunction
with the Athletio clubs committee arranged a c o l -
ourful evening's entertainment of dancing and
firev.-crks i n the midst of which helpings of barbe-
cued pig were served.
The ban, since t h i s year, now covers a l l forms
of external and inter-colleg*ate rags. Other Uni-
v e r s i t i e s are allowed t h e i r Charity Rags: the l o r d
Kayor has h i s procession; and much nearer home,
Guild's runs i t s F i e l d Cup race. I t was noticeable
that the intervention of the police acted as an
incentive and not a dsmper on the l a t t e r occasion.
But t h i s i s by-the-by. The question which
students ask i s "Is t h i s just?".

Jim Anderson speaks about November 5th.
The f i r s t I.C. Union meeting of the year wan
held i n the large Chemistry lecture theatre at
1.15 on October 20th.. with Jim Anderson i n the
chair. The minutes of the last meeting, dealing
ohlefly with the 'procurement of Worthington for the
bar, and the cheap-and-nastiness of some gowns,
were quickly dealt with, as was the absence of
correspondence. On the topic of November 5th.,
the President announced that the Senate had again
decreed that any student taken into custody on that
dav would be hauled before a disciplinary committee
& either sent down or suspended. Th>v Entertainments
Committee therefore proposed to hold, as i n previous
years,, a hop at Harlington, complete with novelties
which last year included a bonfire and barbecue.
The evening's entertainment, including transport
to and from Harlington, would cost one s h i l l i n g .
There was no vocal opposition, although Mr. Heme
sought an assurance, promptly given, that the
Inadequacy of the bar would not be repeated. Mr.
Marshall wanted to know i f the proceedings had
perforce to end at 12 o'clock, to which Jim Ander-
son replied that most people have to be back i n
their digs by that hour, especially the young
ladles. To another question he replied that a l -
though there would be no o f f i c i a l rag committee,
nothing prevented the formation of anlnofficial
one.
The Chairman of the Entertainments Committee,
George Reece, spoke about the Commemoration B a l l
on October the 26th. He emphasised that the drinks
w i l l be at usual pub prices, and that a served
supper w i l l be Included.
Jim Anderson thin informed the Union that an
I.C. Exploration Board had been set up, to encourage
ovsraeas exploration by College expeditions. The
College were giving £5,000, and the Union £1,000.
There was no discussion on this.
Question on the progress of the Union elicited
the information that the work would be completed
within a year. More rooms In the Beit building were
to be turned over to the hostel, and i t was intended
that the Botany and Zoology departments should, even-
tually, follow suit. The hojtel would then accomodate
500 residents.
The question of Bookstall prices was yet again
raised, the!President promising to look into the
incident cited. The meeting closed at about 1.35,
which was remarkably early. Union meetings are for
students to express their opinions and to ask
questions; i t is to be hoped that the Union w i l l be
less subdued in future.

The answer i s d i f f i c u l t . The decree was f a i r et
•the time. I t s justice should now be tempered with
mercy - inatead of which, the Senate House appears
to have become a mouthpiece of the Metropolitan
Police.
