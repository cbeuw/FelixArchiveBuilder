Bitting on the front ron of the Arena and they now
took their places on the platform.
the Choir then Bang "The Fountain".words by Chris-
topher Hasr,all, music by Antony Hopkins^ which had
been written especially for the occasion. This piece
of ausio seemed very f i t t i n g , although i t could have
been a l i t t l e more Impressive. The choir's rendering
of this music was of the standard that we have come
to expect of them.

The Special V i s i t o r , Lord Adrian, was i n t r o -
duced by Viscount Falmouth, who gave a b r i e f sur-
vey of the two years since the l a s t Commemoration
Day, making special reference to the expansion
scheme commenced i n 1953.
Lord Adrian i s one of the most eminent of a l l
B r i t i s h scientists today. He i s world-famous for
his work i n technological f i e l d s . He spoke of the
College as a late Victorian enterprise, and told
those present that Imperialism had changed into
the Commonwealth, but that B r i t i s h Technology was
evident i n a l l comers of the earth -• a proud mon-
ument to the old craftsmanship of our Motherland.
Inventiveness was not taught, i t was born, and out
of t h i s and Craftsmanship had sprung a Technology
which was embodied i n the Imperial College. Stu-
dents, he said, should be trained as leaders of
this Technology, and not as single-mended special-
i s t s
D r . L i n s t e a d closes C e r e m o n y
Lord Adrian, having finished h i s speech, sat
down; and the Rector thanked him f o r his kindness
i n attending our celebration. Dr. Linstead spoke
b r i e f l y about the new Honorary Fellows, and then
to the students who had been presented. He asked
them to cast back t h e i r minds to the time when they
were Freshmen: "You have changed a great deal!".
He was glad and happy to welcome them too "The Old
Boys" of the College, and he hoped they would carry
on the traditions.
Having brought the.ceremony to a close, the
assembled throng stood f o r "The Queen". The Mareh-
afc rose, and the Recession of the. p r i n c i p a l guesfrs
followed. Visitors and students alike made their
way to City and Guilds' College, where, i n the
words of a R.S.M. Freshman "A j o l l y good tea was
provided1"

The Commemoration B a l l on Wednesday evening
was honoured by the presence of the Rector and hia
wife. Unfortunately, the high price and the mid-
week date seemed to have kept away many other of
our prominent members, who would otherwise have at-
tended. More fortunately,perhaps, those who went
found that the thick carpets, the g i l t and cut glass
of the Dorchester made even the most impecunious
of us f e e l at ease with our bankers.

B i l l S a v i l l ' s Orchestra was very good, and
his piper had the most unlikely people doing eight-
some reels to their obvious enjoyment. The College
Flag had been hung behind the high table, i n spite
of an e a r l i e r and unsuccessful attempt to purloin
i t on the way to the Dorchester. The meal proved to
be- very pleasant, and "Le Vacherln aux Praises", on
sampling, was none other than Strawberry Flan and
Ice Cream. The wines and service, naturally enough,
were a credit to the Dorchester. When dancing f i n a l -
l y ceased at 2.30, the "Evening" was continued by
various groups at London Airport, the Hostel, and
f i n a l l y i n the Pubs of Covent Garden.
To the Entertainments Chairman and Secretary
must go a vote of thanks f o r a good B a l l .
