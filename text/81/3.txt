We tender our humble apologies t 0 the Rector
and a l l American Servicemen f o r a misinterpretation
of his speech. We included the remark "when the
American Servicemen were i n B r i t a i n . " which was a
misrepresentation of the Rector's remark about
"what the Americans c a l l the bumper-baby crops of
the" war years."
The Freshmen enjoyed a paradoxial situation
at the beginning of this session. There are
fewer Union f a c i l i t i e a t h i s term than there have
ever been. But the h o s p i t a l i t y with which they
were greeted has few, i f any, equals i n years
past. • We older ones have done our part. Now

Boxing to moat people at I.C. is a barbarous, bloody and
brutal sport. This i s simply not true. To begin vita, a boxer
must bo very f i t , and training i s rigorous. I.C. has a train-
ing session three times a week, whioh i s as follows.
O 3 s 2 j min. rounds skipping; to strengthen leg and shoulder
tsiusoles and to develop lightness of foot and breath control.
2) 20 ndn. of exoercisesj for stomach, leg and arm muscles.
3) 74- min. shadow boxing (speed)
4.) 7i min. light bag punching (speed & timing)
5 5 H min. heavy bag punching (arm musoles)
6) Short sparing with 16 oz. gloves.
7) Skipping and roadvrark (for limbering down)
8) Actual Ringwork. 8 oz. gloves and gum-shield worn. A Ref-
ereee who i s experienced in the art watches over contestants,
novices are matched against novices, no boxer is allowed to
fight a man more than 7 lb. heavier than himself,etc. etc.
These and other rules protect the amateur boxer.
On November 10 th. there will be a University trial.
A cup i s awarded annually to the best boxing College, and
at the end of the season a competition will be held for the
Blott Cup - lost won in 1952 by I.C..I.C. captain this .ear
i s also U.L. captain of Boxing - Lan Palmer.

LETTBBS TO THB EDITOR Cont.
23rd October, 1955.
Dear Sir,
I cannot allow the preposterous 'Viewpoint', whioh
unfortunately appeared in your last issue, to go
unchallenged . One may only suppose that i t s misguided
author was tempararily lodged in some modern Utopia.
He proposes that the Ball be held in some such
plaoe as the Kensington Town Hall, implying that the
standard would not suffer. Really J.V.B., one might as
well say that 'Felix' should be printed on toilet paper.
It wuld indeed be cheaper and contain the basic essentials
but with due respect to the above mentioned Hall, would i t
be really suitable? Even at the time of writing was not
J.V.B. himself dubious about this question? If not, then
why should he raise the over-familiar ory for subsidisation,
as an alternative method of "liquidating" the Ball as we
know it?
Here may I quote 'Viewpoint' j
"How many of us oar, really afford this extravagance?"
I was pleased to learn that J.V.B. regards the
Ball as an extravagance. It is a view I think we a l l share,
but few would agree to the Union paying for jn extravagance
at the expense of some more mundane and useful service,
such as the maintenance of our Sports Ground. For that is
what subsidisation would mean since the resources of the
Union are not limitless.
May I further suggest that, i f such folly was
blessed by Council, i t would benefit only a small minority
of Union members. To be factual let us say that the
maximum number to be accomodated would be a thousand. Off
hand I know of no suitable place for even this number.
Allow a meagre 3°0 for Staff, old students, eto. We are
left with 350 double tickets - 350 students subsidised at
a luxury by a total of some 2500. Is this satisfactory?
In conclusion, may I heartily endorse J.V.B.'s
opinion that a l l students should attend at least one
Commemoration Ball but please, a real Ball not an abortion
of' one.
Tours sincerely,
S.d. Reeoe.

We thank Mr. Leaver for his l e t t e r explaining
the U.L.U. cards but we do think that U.L.U.
should not have been so autocratic that they f e l t
i t unnecessary to give us t h i s explanation at the
same time as the cards
** For the mathematically minded. I t n, » no. oX
cards printed, x » t o t a l cost, xnen x i s proportional
to 1/n. since x-»eo when n-* 0 t h i s move has doubtless
saved U.L.U. from acute f i n a n c i a l embarassment.

At the R.S.M. Union meeting on Tuesday 18th
October, the one year probationary period of
Clementine was ended by the unanimous vote that she
should be kept f o r ever.
From "King's News" October 20th 1955
"We are proud and honoured to be able to

paid to any college i n the University - to King's
