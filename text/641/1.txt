New barriers of human endurance
were broken last Saturday when
the annual meeting of the Univer-
sity of London Union's General
Union Council lasted for a
staggering eight hours.
This was mainly due to the
disruptive tactics of students
from Kings College who had
nominated about thirty joke
candidates for all the U L U
sabbatical and non-sabbatical
posts.
The elections for student
members of the Senate were held
first, starting at 11:00am. There
were no joke candidates in this
section and all passed fairly
smoothly. Then delegates had an
hour off for lunch. The election
Bar Loss
Jimmy Carroll, manager of the
Union Bar, has left his post
following a disagreement with
College over the accuracy of bar
account audits. Mr Carroll has
been Bar Manger for 3 years.
College Finance and Refec-
tory administrators had been
carrying out a series of checks,
partly because of the imminent
expiry of the current bar licence
and partly as a tightening up
procedure brought about by
tight economic conditions. A
recently introduced auditing
system recently revealed a
discrepancy in the accounts, and
a dispute developed over the
system. Geoffrey Reeves, Chief
Security Officer, is confident
that the new system is accurate,
but bar staff have disagreed, and
at a meeting with Refectory
administrators on Thursday Mr
Carroll felt that he was accused
of financial mismanagment
of financial mismanagement.
College authorities have
stressed that they have every
faith in the students who work
part-time behind the bar.
No. 641 • k ^ M H H H H
for President provided a fore-
taste of what was to come. Even
though only five of the joke
candidates had turned up and
four were having their speeches
made for them, the proceedings
lasted for some time. The joke
candidates made speeches
condemning the state of ULU
and the NUS, saying it had no
relevance to the vast majority of
students. The speeches on behalf
of candidates not present
included readings from The
Daily Telegraph, a hymn book,
old manifestos and poetry
books.
Michael George was elected to
a non-sabbatical position be-
cause one of the serious candi-
dates was disqualified on a
technicality. Commenting about
the tactic by Kings College,
David Josse, a Kings member of
the ULU executive, said that it
had been his idea but that he
never expected it to actually be
carried out. Nevertheless he
thought it had made a valid
point about the unrepresentative
nature of ULU.
FIRE IN
BEIT!
Two students filling a gas-fuelled
cigarette lighter in a corridor of
Beit Hall started a fire last
Sunday week.
The students allowed gas to
leak from a canister, forming a
cloud which ignited when they
tested the lighter. Had either of
them inhaled any of the gas, the
resulting explosion could well
have been fatal. Enough gas had
however leaked around a locked
door to start a fire in another
resident's room, destroying a
jacket and damaging the door
and frame. The fire was only
extinguished when a spare set of
keys was found to unlock the
Beit Security and students in
the Hall and adjacent Union
Building were slow to react when
the fire alarm was set off at
about 21:45. The only Union
Officer in the area at the time,
Jon Barnett, started clearing the
building. Most of the residents
thought that this was a fire drill,
in spite of the late hour. Staff
and students in the adjoining
Botany and Biology buildings
claim that the alarm in those
buildings was not loud enough
to be heard. A full report on the
incident and evacuation pro-
cedure has been sent to Bob
Foggon, the College Fire Offi-
cer.

their way through 190 before time was called.
