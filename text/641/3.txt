Wet from
Bath
Sir Geoffrey Howe's budget
came in for some guarded
criticism from one of his own
backbenchers last Thursday.
Christopher Patten, Conserva-
tive MP for Bath, told students
that he would like to see
more capital investment by
government to stimulate the
economy. He also advocated the
complete abolition of the
National Insurance Surcharge,
the 'tax on jobs' introduced by
Storm in
a Tea-Room
Staff and students of the division
of Life Sciences have complained
that the department should
urgently re-instate the sale of tea
and coffee in Bot-Zoo tea room.
A petition with over three
hundred signatures from dis-
gruntled Life Scientists has been
given to Professor Wood, the
Head of Department.
The common room was unique
in IC as the only place where
staff and students would regu-
larly meet informally. Since the
sale of coffee ceased, the
common room has hardly been
i used at all.
To take advantage of this, the
lUnion Lower Refectory has
I started selling coffee and biscuits
in the morning, but opinion in
the department is that the
atmosphere is not the same.
Satansoc
Exorcised
An application to form a Devil-
Worship Society at IC has been
withdrawn after two of the
founding members withdrew their
names.
The society, whose constitu-
tional aims were to have been
promoting the occult in College,
was conceived during a parti-
cularly boring Union Finance
Committee meeting. Conse-
quently the list of twenty
signatures required for the
formation of the club reads like
a roll-call of Union hacks, and
bears the name of this year's and
next year's executive (including
Stephen Goulder and Gaynor
Lewis) a wealth of other Union
Officers and—most surprising of
all —Jen Hardy-Smith, the
eminently respectable Union
Administrator. It has not been
revealed which of these have
withdrawn their names.

the last Labour government,
instead of just its reduction to
one percent. The money to pay
for this extra spending would
come from increasing the Public
Sector Borrowing Requirement,
something which the Chancellor
has been aiming to keep as low
as possible.
Mr Patten, who belongs to the
liberal wing of his party, was
speaking at the invitation of the
Conservative Society. He dealt
mainly with economic matters,
but in response to questions he
commented on a variety of issues
including the next General
Election which he (unsur-
prisingly) predicted the Conser-
vatives will win.
There will be an opportunity
for Sir Geoffrey Howe to have
his say on the government's
economic policy when he speaks
in College on Tuesday May 3 in
the second week of next term.
Plaque
Intact
RCS students have reacted with
shock and disbelief to the recent
disappearance of a very fine
mosaic on the Old Huxley
Building. When this fine build-
ing on the east side of Exhibition
Road was erected, a mosaic
panel was built into the wall with
the sign 'Royal College of
Science', and there it remained,
despite the move to the new
Huxley Building in Queen's
Gate, until last week, when a
new sign proclaiming the Henry
Cole Extension to the Victoria
and Albert Museum took its
place.
RCS Vice President elect Dave
Parry wrote to the V&A express-
ing his consternation.
Guilds Get Results
The Keeper yesterday assured
a FELIX reporter that the RCS
mosaic will remain intact:
'To remove it would mean
disintegration,' he said, as it is
an integral part of the fabric and
history of the building. The new
sign is mounted on a free-
standing panel.
Mobile Optics Inc will inves-
tigate further and report to
FELIX readers in the first issue
of next term.

Warding Off Lauwerys
A non-academic residence mana-
ger is to replace most wardens in
IC residences, if Mr J Lauwerys
goes ahead with the plans he
proposed at a student/staff
committee on Monday.
The meeting, which lasted
from 10:00am to 7:30pm, had a
double purpose: for the Union to
question Mr Lauwerys on his
recent report on residence
management, and for College to
probe the Union's response to
the report. College is planning to
implement some of the report's
recommendations at the end of
term.
The two main points raised
during the long debate con-
cerned the introduction of a
central residence manager and
the transfer of residence subsidy.
The latter point has come about
as part of College's money-
saving programme for the next
few years. It would certainly
cause a rent increase, which
would put off students who seek
College accommodation. Union
President Stephen Goulder
believes that residence subsidy is
an investment which bears its
fruits to College.
To improve efficiency and
save money, Mr Lauwerys has
23,
said that the residence manage-
ment system should become
more centralised. He has there-
fore proposed a plan according
to which the number of Wardens
and Subwardens should be
drastically cut while the post of
Assistant Subwardens should be
eliminated. A residence manager
would be introduced instead, as
a co-ordinator of residence and
Student Services. Such a mana-
ger would not be a member of
the academic staff, but would be
employed by College as part of
the administrative staff. Mr
Lauwerys seemed unable to
bring forward very good argu-
ments in favour of the proposal,
except that the Summer Letting
Scheme is not run to its full
capability and College needs
more income for that sector. In
his opinion, a professional
residence manager would be
vital to improve the situation.
Mr Goulder has pointed out that
no warden has yet been reported
for not doing a good job and a
very good residence manager
would be very expensive to hire.
Mr Goulder also believes that
members of staff are more
concerned with student welfare
than a finance expert would be.
