FELIX Style
I hadn't intended to reply to the
inevitable response (Page 4) to
my criticism of Pallab Ghosh's
election publicity, but since
Pallab has specifically asked me
to, and since he has badly
misquoted me, I shall.
In his letter Pallab writes 'It is
certainly not my intention to
encourage a split between the
Union and College'. I'm glad to
hear it, but surely, if this is his
attitude, it was misleading to
write in his publicity 'A contro-
versial newspaper can easily lead
to the oft quoted "us and them"
situation'.
Secondly, Pallab criticises me
for saying that an outspoken
campaigning FELIX wouldn't
be taken seriously. What I said
was that a deliberately antagon-
istic FELIX will not be taken
seriously, something I still
believe to be true.
Thirdly, I am accused of not
offering relevant comment. As
an example, it is pointed out that
I have said nothing about the
EDITORIAL
patently ridiculous aspects of the
Lauwerys Report on Residence.
This is for the very good reason
that I prefer my Editorials to
express my own directly-formed
opinions, and not base them on
second-hand information glean-
ed from Union cheese and wine
parties. The Lauwerys Report is
nearly a hundred pages long and
I haven't had time to read it yet.
Has Pallab I wonder?
Apart from Lauwerys, I
admit, I haven't commented on
many aspects of student life.
Specifically, I have restricted my
editorials to mascotry, sexism in
the Union, procedural wrang-
lings at UGMs, FELIX news
style, Mary Freeman, bar-
accounts, fire alarms, apathy
on Council, the Southside move,
the Guildshit affair, the new
refectory, Harlington gravel,
College's attitude to the water
strike, Mines Review, Union
democracy, Exec Torture,
sabbatical elections...There's so
much to say without carping at
College all the time. Of course
Mooney meals are awful. I know
that, you know that, and all of
College knows it too; is there
anything to be gained by saying
so every week? I don't think so.
It has been said (by Steve
Marshall, actually) that the
FELIX Editor should produce
the kind of FELIX he himself
would like to read, were he not
involved in the Union. I have
tried to do this, and the result
has been a F E L I X which I
would describe as more serious
and responsible, and Pallab
would describe as lacking in
biting satire and with no sense of
fun. Some people prefer my
FELICES, some will prefer his.
It doesn't worry me much either
way.
Small Ads
Small Ads got out of hand this
week. Lots of them were anony-
mous (straight in the bin) or
obscene (ditto) or pseudo-
nymous (thrown out if we detect
them). But despite that, we still
had to cut over three-quarters of
all the 'silly' small ads submitted
because there just isn't space for
them. Please try to exercise a
little restraint in future.
Impossible Without
Adrian James, Olivo Miotto,
Melanie Steel and J Martin
Taylor for news, Peter Hobbis
for photography, Pinocchio and
Walkabout-Looksee for their

Iz and Tim Pigden for reviews,
Chris Mallaband for sport,
Diane Love for What's On,
Caroline Foers, Viv Draper, La
Iatrou, Shweta Otiv, Lynne
James and Andy Wood for
pasting-up, Maz and Pete the
Print, and everyone who helped
me make FEELSICK.

UNUSUAL TO have a story
concerning someone so new to
the pinnacles of fame, yet
already people are fighting to tell
me all the scandal about Andrew
Owens, the recently-elected Ents
Officer.
We start with a small ad
submitted nearly six months
ago, but which somehow never
made its way into the pages of
FELIX. I quote:
Andrew Owens Chem Eng II.
Do you want your French
knickers back? And stock-
ings, suspender belt and not
to mention the frilly red G-
string.
(Incidentally isn't 'not to
mention' a curious expression?
How can one say 'not to men-
tion something' without men-
tioning it? But to return to Mr
Owens's underwear.)
David W Parry, RCS hack
and Vice President elect has
taken a great interest in the
matter, and to this end he has
been persuading his flat-mate
the pretty and ever-obliging life
scientist Debbie Cooper to
model these garments in the
same eye-catching manner she
showed with life science sweat-
shirts last term. Alas, Debbie is
willing, but the underwear is
now somehow scattered 'far and
wide across London' so we may

up to in his spare time.
Before I leave this tale though,
you may be interested to know
that the man who placed the
small ad has also subsequently
risen to fame: it was Mr Gareth
Fish.
ONE L A S T WORD on *he
sabbatical elections: make sure
you keep a cc; y of the successful
candidates' ht...J-outs—they will
make ;uperb ammunition next
year. Would you have remem-
bered Goulder's prcmi.:; of a
refectory boycott if he hadn't
committed himself in writing?
BRYAN 'PIGGY' LEVITT, the
obese chemistry lecturer and
Mayor of Kensington and
Chelsea, has been featuring in
the gossip column of The Times
recently. As usual, he was being
criticised for his authority's
decision to demolish the old
town hall, but the point which
caused most amusement in the
FELIX Office was the way The
Times reported that when his
opinions were challenged, he
stoutly defended them.
I March
I PROMISE faithfully that this
will be my last jibe at Andy
Grimshaw this term. As you
may recall, after the hassle of
elections had subsided, Andy
presented the FELIX news staff
with a detailed breakdown of the
voting figures, which we printed
directly on the cover of the last
FELIX. Did any of you notice
that they didn't add up?
I'M SURE you've all heard of
Parkinson's Law: work expands
to fill the time available. Rather
less well known, but just as
valid, is the Peter Principle:
every individual is promoted to
his own level of incompetence.
In other words, if you do your
job well, then sooner or later you
will get promoted; if you do the
new job well, you will get
promoted from that, too, until
eventually you are promoted to
a job which is beyond your
capabilities, and there you stay,
undeserving of further pro-
motion, promoted to your own
level of incompetence.
But to my knowledge, there is
only one man who has applied
the Peter Principle in reverse,
namely tht if you start high
enough up with a job you do
badly, it is possible to work your
way down the ladder until,
sooner or later, you will arrive at
a job you can do with some
degree of ability.

The name I have in mind is
John Passmore. He started at
the top with the post of Union
President, a job at which he did
not excel. The following year he
climbed down to U L U Senate
and spent another year achieving
very little. Now he is Council
Chairman, next year U G M
Chairman, the year after
We can only wonder how far
down he will have to drop before
he reaches a job he can do welt.
Union sherry monitor, perhaps'.'
THE UNION CAN be a cruel
place at times. As many of you
will know, Phil Greenstreet was
elected to the post of Deputy
President last year, but was
unable to take up his appoint-
ment because he failed his final
year exams, so is not of 'aca-
demic standing'. As a result, Phil
has been earning his living
working in the Union Bar, and
one evening he was at his post
engaged in conversation with
Mark Smith, last year's FELIX
Editor. Phil had made some
small joke at Mark's expense,
and Mark turned to the rest of
his friends in mock outrage.
'Bloody cheek of these bar
staff!' he stormed. 'I don't know
what the place is coming to.
They'll be employing people
with degrees in here next.'
