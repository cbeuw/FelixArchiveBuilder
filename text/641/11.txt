ULU Cup
IC vs UC 1-0
A brilliant second half perfor-
mance saw IC retain the inter-
collegiate Challenge Cup. After
a poor first half performance a
few harsh words from coach
Steve 'Big Jack' Ward put fear
and shame in the hearts of Andy
Page's men. The effect was a
thoroughly professional second
half where IC's total dedication,
superb skill and controlled
aggression totally crushed the
opposition. For a period of
twenty minutes, during which
John Rigby scored the winner,
IC could have scored five or six
goals. Graeme Rickard scored
with the last kick of the game:
but the ref said he had blown
first. Fittingly the end of the
'Rickard era' was graced with
the retention of the cup. Hi pasta
pudding!

mentor Noel Lindsay (47). After
tanking up at lunchtime, Guilds
steamroller slipped effortlessly
into gear. The hazy mist and rain
cast an ethereal glow over the
proceedings. Indeed there was
magic in the air as the man with
the electric sleeping bag coached
his team to hitherto-undreamed-
of peaks of achievement. Scores
of note were Mark (44), Leader
(44), Noel (43) and Gary 'Gut'
Smith (43). Final score C & G
421, RCS 420, RSM 366.
On Wednesday 9 we played
host in a shoulder-to-shoulder
match against Kings College.
Leader for the day Gordon
Bowser was horrified to find that
Kings had included Common-
wealth Silver Medallist Mathew
Guille. Our hero replied with a
'zero' which helped IC to a 4
point defeat.
Scores: J Symons 95, J Austen
93, G Smith 97, A Hamilton 95,
T Higgs 95.
Last week Steve Harrison (Club
Captain, contact via the Elec
Eng letter-racks) showed himself
to be arguably the top sports-
man in any sports club at
Imperial College. Steve, the
Guilds Captain, led his team to a
stonking victory over RCS and
RSM with a 44 at 600 yards at
Bisley. This was despite condi-
tions of near-invisibility and
torrential rain which had Bourke
and Higgs Hounding helplessly.
Guilds generously allowed RCS
to develop a 6-point lead in the
morning with good perfor-
mances from Pauline (46-her
score, not waist size), Tim (46),

Jonathan (46) and the Guilds

Two Sundays ago twelve of us
saw Glasgow Dynamoes beaten
by Streatham Redskins' Gary
Steffan, which gentleman now
figures second only to Replicant
Roy Batty of Blade Runner in
the all-time superhero ratings.
Thanks to those who turned up
especially John for missing the
bus stop and Mark for gross
stupidity.
Cliff Spooner is actively
engaged in finding ways of
flooding the Squash Courts and
freezing them over, but doesn't
think that South Ken Sports will
authorise the move.

have an enjoyable vacation.
and 4th places. In the second
race Phil and Graham has a brief
moment of glory as they followed
two UL2 boats to the wrong
mark and then ripped round the
. correct one in the lead. However,
UL went on to win this race and
the match. PS: The owner of the
cleanest polar suit around would
like to say that he is taking up
Laser sailing because there is less
far to fall!

These results virtually mark the
end of the competitive season,
although a few friendlies may be
arranged next term. Final
positions will only be known in
June. I do thank however all
those who have played, es-
pecially those who have toler-
ated playing away more fre-
quently than at home, or at short
notice, in order to accommodate
people who will not travel to
matches.
Congratulations to Howard
for beating StMH's J P R
Williams two weeks ago. Also
congratulations to N Walker
who at last Thursday's A G M
was re-elected club treasurer, to
T Goss (Secretary) and to J
Grout (Social Secretary). At the
meeting it was decided to
postpone the elections of the
mens and ladies captains until
after Easter.

In their last league match of the
season the IC team travelled to
Queen Mary Sailing Club,
Britain's largest sailing club, to
take on City University, and
UL2. In ideal team racing
conditions a force three breeze,
City demonstrated their fami-
liarity with their boats with
superior boat speed and han-
dling and won fairly easily.
Against UL2 IC put up more
of a fight; in the first race Dave
and Kate led from start to finish
but could do little against the
UL2 combination of 2nd, 3rd,
As most people are probably
aware it is time to start thinking
about the summer. To many that
means a holiday, beers by the
river...but to a selected few the
beginning of the summer heralds
the start of the cricket season—
bats are oiled, whites are taken
out of mothballs and the grass is
cut. At IC the season gets under
way on the first Wednesday of
next term. Details are posted on
the noticeboard outside the
Union Bar and all players past,
present and future should check
team selection and, details of
trials, directing and complaints,
etc, to Simon Tear (Geology 3).
We are still looking for
undiscovered talent (aren't we
all?) and anybody interested in
playing, umpiring, scoring or
just having a good time on tour,
should contact Simon or myself.
All cricket players should also
add the date of the annual
dinner—May 13—to their dia-
ries. Tickets will be available
from the beginning of term. I
canfeel the sun on my back and
the pleasure of hitting the
quickie for six already.
