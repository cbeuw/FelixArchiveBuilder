-STOIC are unlikely to improve

The Penrose tessellation, the subject of Dr Pretzel's talk to MOPSOC
on Thursday, is one of the most astonishing mathematical
curiosities ever discovered. First drawn by Roger Penrose (who
also invented the famous optical illusion of the ever-descending
staircase) the pattern has an enormous number of amazing and
beautiful properties, nearly all of which can be demonstrated using
O-level maths. Well worth joining MOPSPOC just for this lecture.

Audio Society Linn Products
started an audio revolution in
the early 70s with their claim
that turntables actually
influence sound reproduction.
The idea that a system can only
sound as good as the record
player feeding it may seem
quite obvious to most of us, but
even today many people do not
believe it.
Initially their disk piaying
source was without question
the best in the world, but
today controversy rages as to
whether others are better.
There is no doubt that the Linn
Sondek turntable and Ittok
arm and Asak cartridge is the
combination by which all
others must be judged.
