Dear Martin
You really must be desperate
for ideas if you have to stoop to
quoting out of context and to
misrepresentation in order to
have something of interest in
your editorial for a change.
It is certainly not my intention
to do all 1 can to encourage a
split between the Union and
College neither do I propose to
antagonise College through the
pages of FELIX next year.
The point I made in my
handout was that the FELIX
Editor should not be afraid of
taking firm and decisive stands
on issues important to students.
This is something. I feel, you
have singularly failed to do this
year. A case in point is the
recently released Lauwerys
report on residence—there was
not one word of editorial
comment.
The FELIX Editor has the
unique advantage to be able to
say what he (and students) really
feel about such short-sighted,
half-baked proposals that
! regularly emanate from College.
These reports are written by
| people who, like yourself, are
i totally out of touch with the
people they are dealing with,
unable to appreciate the very
real problems faced by students.
Your failure to give a positive
reaction against some of the
more patently ridiculous aspects
of the Lauwerys Report has left
College with the impression that
students are quite happy with
drastic rent increases and a
; reduction of security guards,
subwardens and messengers.
Next year's President is now in a
far weaker negotiating position
i with College than she would
I have been otherwise.
You stated in your editorial
i that an outspoken, campaigning
F E L I X wouldn't be taken

seriously. I would disagree, it's a
bland uninformative FELIX
with no opinions or relevant
comment that isn't taken seri-
ouslv.

FELIX Editor Elect
Free Weed
with FELIX
Dear Martin
I wonder how many of those
people who voted in the sabba-
tical elections had read the most
recent issue of The Wellsian
produced by Mr Pallab Ghosh,
now FELIX Editor-elect. Page 3
of this issue bears an advertise-
ment placed by a shop called
'American Retro'. The Adver-
tisement takes the form of a
photograph of what is, to my
naive eyes, a rather dated
chemistry set containing,
amongst other things, cigarette
papers, peculiar looking pipes,
small spoons and mirrors. Some
of my learned friends have told
me that these devices are
occasionally to be seen in the
hands of junkies and drug
addicts.
Although I feel that Mr
Ghosh ought to be congratu-
lated for his initiative in finding
such an advertisement I wonder
whether he will continue to use
this particular advertiser when
he is FELIX Editor next year.
Following your precedent of
giving away seaweed in the
Xmas issue of FELIX might not
Mr Ghosh be tempted to distri-
bute a more pungent and nar-
cotic weed next year?
Shall we be reading articles
extolling the virtues of magic
mushrooms or else finding little
plastic bags of white powder
amongst the pages of our
favourite newspaper?
Friday morning lectures
could be quite mind-blowing
next year.

Big City
Blues
Dear Martin
I read with avid interest the
highly sensitive article submitted
by Don Adlington. I feel entirely
sympathetic to the problems
faced by some students, to which
'most people' are oblivious.
However, I feel that if Mr
Adlington's article is parti-
cularly relevant to his experience
with IC students, I wonder why
• H H M H M H H March
he has omitted to mention one
crucial factor in lheir lives—that
is. the influence of "the big city".
For sonic, this tunc can be
a very problematic chapter in
their lives. What 1 believe could
be the most daunting prospect
for many students is I he con-
frontation with .monviiulx. a
totally unknown environment,
and this especially in large elites.
Social contacts instead of being
enhanced, arc thwarted In the
vast scale of lliings. In inosi of
the smaller universities, this
problem is less evident. Surely
students in London must be the
toughest of all if the\ arc to
maintain a reasonable degree of
emotional stability?
However, all students have to
learn to cope with the practical
and emotional factors of adapt-
ing to a somewhat drastic-
change in lifestyle, whether
welcome or not. For the major-
ity of freshers, everything sorts
itself out and they then go on to
have the time of their lives.
In my opinion, students do,
on the whole, tend to be fairly
cushioned at university in
relation to the public at large
(hence the popularity of further
degrees?). The cost of living for
students is matched with their
low income (student reductions
etc). And university offers such
incomparable opportunities to
excel oneself (eg sabbatical
posts) that all the emotional
wranglings must be worth it in
the end—especially if you come
out with a degree to boot!

In Defence
Dear Sir
Stephen Goulder's letter to
the Head of the Department of
Computing describes Roger
Bailey's behaviour as 'offensive
and constitutionally unaccept-
able' and 'a flagrant interference
in our democratic processes'.
President Reagan would have
been proud of such words when
writing to complain of the
Russian invasion of Afghanis-
tan.
I am informed that Roger
said that student politicians are
'wankers'. Having been one for
the last few months I would
consider the analysis correct.
Perhaps the real reason the
Bot/Zoo tea room shut was
because of all the storms in the
vicinity making the carrying of
tea cups, when full, difficult.

Watch It!
/><•<;/• Sir.
Shame on you, Martin, for
making insinuations that you
know to be untrue about STOIC
tBelow the Belt last week)! We
both know that STOIC has an
avid audience which duly reflects
the high quality of our output.
Bearing in mind that we require
our viewers to go to specific
places at particular times of the
day to see our programmes, it is
not reasonable to expect thou-
sands of viewers, but our
audience is quite definitely non-
zero! One wonders how many
people would read FELIX if
they had to peruse it in the
FELIX Office at 1:00 or 6:00pm
on Fridays!
You certainly seem to have a
strange way of showing your
appreciation of the efforts made
by the several STOIC members
who regularly collate your organ
on Thursday evenings. If you
don't print this, we will feed you
to the folding machine!!
Yours 'till the tape runs out

Devil
May Care
Dear Martin
I must thank you for your
brief introduction to the Devil
Worshipping Society in last
week's FELIX, and naturally
you will appreciate that I am
very interested in the furtherance
of my name.
Obviously, mortals may
experience difficulty in commu-
nicating with one such as myself,
and so I have consented to Mr
Ian Bull being my medium.
One or two things that I did
suggest to him were a stone
circle in Beit Quad, and possibly
an altar as well, as these are very
important in worshipping my
'bad' self. Fortunately, the
goats, hens, etc, along with the
various sacrificial instruments
may be slightly less of a problem,
but virgins may have to be on
Five Year Plans.
And so I must away to spread
the evil word, and I leave Ian Bull
to continue procuring more
servants to a very unworthy
cause.
/ leave you, as ever, in my debt
