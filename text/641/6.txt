Jiminy Cricket, Mike and Perola again. I shall retire as Puzzles Editor next vc.ii. since 1 have this degree
thing to thank about. If anyone would consider taking over, perhaps they would like 10 contribute some

I Now some time In the holiday,
when the rain is pelting down,
the wind is blowing and the
electric fire is roaring, cuddle
up with FELIX and play with
yourself. Yes, once again, it's a
word puzzle from Jiminy
Cricket. Rules as usual; you
take one letter at a time, going
up, down or diagonally and
see how many words of three
or more letters you can find.
For instance, starting in the
top lefthand corner you can
form the word 'wane'. How
many can you find?

Port-Passing
Pranks ^
General Reisenschein was holding a dinner
party the other day for his four chiefs of staff
Di Van Zoom, Admiral Zinkorschwimm,
Heidensieck and Gunter Schutzem, and their
four assistants, Reisenschein sat at the head of
the table with four guests down each side. No
one was next to, directly opposite or
diagonally opposite a member of his own
department. Since the air force always
disrupts the proceedings with paper darts,
each air force man was seated next to
someone from the army, and Di Van Zoom
was placed as far from Reisenschein as
possible.
After the meal, Reisenschein got out the
decanter and passed it to one of his
neighbours—but it never finished its circuit of
the table.
'Has anyone seen the port?' asked the
General when he realised he'd only had one
glass.
'Inspected the fleet this afternoon, Sir,'
replied Admiral Zinkorschwimm, who was
sitting on the General's immediate right. (The
admiral can be assumed innocent, since he
drinks only rum.)
'I passed the decanter on a little while ago,'
said Heidensieck's assistant.
'Well, I didn't steal it, and I'm sure I'd have
noticed if the thief was sitting next to me,' said
Heidensieck. 'Hence I know who the culprit
must be.
Who purloined the port, and how many
people hadn't any?
(The decanter was passed either clockwise
or anti-clockwise not in an illogical fashion.)
