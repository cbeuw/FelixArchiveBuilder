The Union:
Monolithic? Bureaucratic? Introspective?
Imperial College Union is in a far from healthy state. Too many times
of late I have heard people saying that the Union is out of touch with
students, that it has no relevance to the average student here. Clearly
the Union is lacking in broad appeal and does not fulfill the role as a
centre of social activity many people expect from it. Another commonly
voiced criticism is that the Union Officers are only doing the jobs for the
prestige or power or as something to put on their CVs. So why has the
Union got the poor image it has in the eyes of so many students?
Perhaps one of the most
common failings within the
circle of people who devote a lot
of time to the Union is that
many of them seem to forget
that they are doing the job to
benefit students, not just doing
the job for its own sake. Stu-
dents are often referred to as
'randoms', as in 'What was
that?' 'Oh nobody, just a
random.' However jovially this
may be intended it points to a
more sinister subconscious
attitude that the average student
really only gets in the way of the
smooth running of the Union
machinery.
The Union has become an end
in itself, a tower of Babel
expanding slowly upwards while
the foundations crumble away
and it has lost sight of any-real
purpose and lost contact with
most of the students.
Related to this is the inevitable
barrier set up between the
President in his office and the
students. Sat behind his desk it is
easy to forget that only1
a few
months ago he was himself a
'random'. No matter how
approachable a president may
claim to be he must make an
unceasing and conscious effort
to remove these barriers. It is not
an easy task and requires a great
deal of effort and orginality of
ideas, but it is one that must be
accomplished before the Union
will be in a position to give
students the service they want.
The task is hampered by the
president's time consuming
commitment on College com-
mittees. I would be the last
person to knock the admirable
degree of student representation
in the administration of College:
however, what good does this do
if the Union can only campaign
for things it assumes students
want rather than things it knows
they want?
Another problem arises from
the need for continuity: because
the executive changes every year
this continuity can be provided
only by the permanent staff; in
particular Jen Hardy-Smith, by
all accounts, does an admirable
job keeping the Union on the
rails. Inevitably this leads to a
continuity that is self-generating
rather than a situation where the
Union takes on a clear direction
and sets out to achieve certain
goals. Changes, at present, are
minor and administrative in
nature, and the Union has no
generalised policy. I would
suggest that policy may be
divided into three levels: first
level which sets out the most
general aims, namely to repre-
sent students and to provide
them with such services, ameni-
ties and activities as they want
which are within the Union's
scope; third level which defines
policy on certain highly specific
areas such as residence, publicity
material, loans, sexist events and
so on; second level (which we
lack) which should both bridge
this gap and give the Union a
sense of purpose.
At the moment the only
common theme running from
one presidency to the next is the
smooth function of the existing
structure: this I suggest is not
good enough, since it implies
zero progress.
As to a solution, I would like
to see the removal of the clause
in the constitution which limits a
sabbatical to one such year in
our Union. A president may
have a lot of good ideas, but will
more than likely be unable to
accomplish much in just one
year. If he is seen to be doing a
good job (and at least half of
doing a good job is being seen to
do so), he ought to be able to
stand for re-election for a second
or possibly a third year. It will
only be the dedicated and
committed who will want to stay
on: those who are elected
because they wanted something
good on their CVs will not spend
a second year on a meagre salary
when they could be earning
more elsewhere. The wasters and
the ineffectual presidents won't
be re-elected.
The Union will, in any event,
continue to provide the excellent
support it does at present to the
clubs and societies. If the
College vote is not cut too
severely we will still have one of
the widest varieties of clubs and
societies of any union in this
country. However, the Union
could, and should, do much
more than simply finance
activities. It should try to reach
every student here in some way:
it should be an organisation that
all students relate to as one to
which they belong, as an organi-
sation of students working for
students. It should be a means of
solving problems of helping
students make the most of the
unique opportunity university
provides in the broadest sense of
the term 'education experience'.
The Union ought to provide a
focal point for all sorts of
student activity, and to do this it
must divest itself of its clique
image and make itself totally
accessable to students.
The whole thing is a vicious
circle: if we have an Exec that
lacks character and direction,
students become uninterested,
they don't get involved in the
Union, and we end up with
another choice for the Exec next
year. The most depressing thing
is it's not the result of apathy.
People here do care, and care a
lot, but are quickly disillusioned
by what they find. If the Union is
to develop this vicious circle
must be broken.
With our newly elected Exec
this change will not be set in
motion from the Union Office;
essentially they stand for main-
taining the status quo. So if
anything is to be done it must be
initiated by the grassroots. If
anyone reading this article
agrees with some or all of the
points raised I would ask of you
two things: first fill in the form
below saying what you think the
Union should be doing for
students that it is not already
doing. Second, if you think you
could be the person to get to the
top and set in motion the long
overdue overhaul, then get a
place on a Union committee, get
the inside information and then
stand for president in a year's
time. At the end of the day, if
you want change and think you
can bring it about, it's up to you
to set it rolling.

In my opinion, the students union is not fulfilling its
purpose as a student organisation because
Neither is it relevant to me as a student here
because
I would like to see the following changes
I think the students union is doing a good job and
think the criticisms expressed in this article are
groundless.
