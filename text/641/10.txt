RCS
No, your eyes do not deceive you—this is an
RCS article.
Our Rag total continues to swell after
another successful venture to Reading last
week. Apart from a late start and a breakdown
everything ran smoothly. If anybody wants to
buy a Rag Mag they are always on sale from
each CCU office—if you're feeling rich you can
buy 9 past ones for only £2.50. It is also
possible to sell them at home over Easter—just
come to the office and let me know how many
you want.
Thanks to all the people who swam at the
gala—who knows if we'd known the change in
the rules we might have won!
If anybody is free this afternoon, I'm sure
Mark would appreciate any help in the office as
he produces the end of term Broadsheet-he
may even provide coffee and biscuits.
Question for the end of term—can the
Mines Exec read?
Have a happy holiday.

Tonight (Wednesday) some of us will be
travelling by tube to Wandsworth, there to
take part in a demonstration which will
Encircle The Council (meeting in the Town
Hall). The point is to show support for the
peace camp actions and opposition to civil
defence plans for a nuclear war. Meet at
5:00pm outside Mech Eng concourse, with a
candle if you remember, or make your own
way there by 6:30pm.
Next week are the two most important
events for CND nationally this Easter. On
Thursday 31 March there will be a women's
blockade of Greenham Common and a mixed
blockade of Burghfield Royal Ordnance
(nuclear bomb) Factory. On Friday April 1 a

Since becoming independent, Moza r»-
bique has started a programme of
technical education intended to make
the country more self-sufficient. Be-
cause of the cost of batteries for calcula-
tors, collections of slide rules have been
organised in several European coun-
tries. If you have a now unused and
unwanted slide rule, please send it to:

STOIC
Hello viewers, we're back with some more
salacious titbits which couldn't quite make
'Below the Belt' this week. The STOIC
committee elections are now settled, and
having peeled the remains of the STOIC toad
from the studio floor, we can now return to
making programmes. The first—and WOW is
it a BIGGIE!—(It had better be—Programme
Ed)—is the fun-packed, thrill-a-minute, laugh-
a-second (Ouch-my nose) EASTER SPECIAL.
No, you won't need special glasses, no it won't
damage your street credibility—but yes, it IS
worth watching. That is all we will have time
for this term, but watch out next term, we'll be
back. Thank you for watching, STOIC is now
closing down (Until tomorrow) eeeeeeee

Amnesty
International
On Tuesday April 19 four or five members of
the ICAI Group will be setting out on an epic
sponsored cycle to Paris, to hand in a letter to
the Benin Ambassador.
In the letter we will point out that Mr Firmin
Awadon, our adopted prisoner, has been held
without charge or trial for over three years.
Given that the Constitution of Benin states
that 'everyone has the right to a fair trial' we
feel that it is time he was released.
We are hoping to raise at least £250 for AI
and, fingers crossed, to get a mention in the
local or national press.
So another year is over and a new committee
has been elected.
On the whole this session has been a fairly
good one. The mailing list increased from 100
to 190, but our attendances at meetings still
fluctuated from roughly 700 to see Red Ken to
5 to see Alan Freeman (mind you it did clash
with Ted Heath). Members participation on
the whole seems to have been lower than the
previous year, but hopefully this will be
rectified in the coming year.
By the way, Rob Kelsey (Civ Eng 3) is still
looking for a few more articles for Radical. So
if you are interested in airing your views would
you hand articles to Rob before the end of
term.
That just leaves me to thank the old
committee whose inspiration has made Soc
Soc what it is today.

The election papers come down at 5:30pm
today so if you're thinking of doing a post next
year then this is your last chance to get your
name down (or if you're going to make your
strategic last minute move).
The election UGM is on Thursday of next
week in G20 (12:45) and I urge you all to come
and vote. The UGM is followed by the
Brighton trip when we go and upset some of
the local hosteHes and then watch the new
Exec get their proverbials frozen off in the
cool, April Brighton sea. It is a good trip and
the coach will be leaving soon after the UGM.
Not much else to say except that can
everyone who still owes money for Camborne
please pay it now to Simon Tear or we'll have
to 'send der boys round'. OK?
Cheers

PS: Have a good Easter Vac and Moving II,
hope you enjoy Cornwall!
