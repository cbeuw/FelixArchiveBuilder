Beer Fest Foiled
Extensive u n i o n effort has all b e e n to n o
avail as the Beer Fest is still h o m e l e s s a n d
n o w apparently cancelled. D u e to t h e
disruption it w o u l d cause, t h e event w a s
refused its usual v e n u e t h e JCR, a n d has
b e e n in trouble ever since. U n i o n Pres-
ident Dave Hellard attempted to salvage
the situation, p r o p o s i n g t h e Southside
g y m as possible premises to stage t h e
event.
Unfortunately this s u g g e s t i o n has
b e e n r e f u s e d by c o l l e g e , as it w a s
assessed to be "inappropriate d u e to
fire regulations to have a beer fest last-
ing t w o or three days" according to Chief
Security Officer Ken Weir. T h e beer fest
has been organised for RAG by the RCSU
By Andrew Ofori
vice president for Clubs a n d Ents B o b
Walker. The H e a d of Catering a n d C o n -
ference Services, John Foster, supplied a
wealth o f explanations as to w h y the
g y m proposal w a s a non-starter. Looking
past the fact that the v e n u e w a s grossly
undersized, h e explained there existed
"a n u m b e r of sensitive issues concerning
[Southside's] neighbours", for instance a
late night event causing late night dis-
turbances could jeopardise IC's prospects
for building d e v e l o p m e n t s in that area.
Furthermore the festival requires an occa-
sional licence f r o m ajustices c o m m i t t e e
that only meet at certain times in t h e
year; e v e n if the application w a s m a d e
o n t i m e there w o u l d b e n o guarantee o f
approval.
M r Foster felt t h e fate o f t h e beer
fest is n o w in the hands o f the union a n d
w a s o f t h e o p i n i o n t h e event w a s "Post-
p o n e d rather than cancelled"; h e sug-
gested DB's or Olady's at St. Mary's as
p o s s i b l e alternatives. V a r i o u s u n i o n
m e m b e r s v ie w t h e latest d e v e l o p m e n t s

Sarah C o b u r n , R A G Chair, mirrored his
disappointment, c o m m e n t i n g "I'm not
impressed".

Tres Cher, Chez Harrods CCUs In Trouble
By Helena Cocheme
According to t h e advertisement, 'There
is only O N E sale'. The a n n u a l o p e n i n g
of t h e Christmas sale at Harrods, w h i c h
clocks up o n average a p h e n o m e n a l mil-
lion p o u n d s per hour, is a distinguished
ritual. It s e e m e d as if t h e c r o w d started
gathering at d a w n o n W e d n e s d a y 6 Jan-
uary, because by half past eight in t h e
m o r n i n g , t h e p a v e m e n t w a s p a c k e d .
Eager shoppers a n d d e d i c a t e d celebrity
watchers jostled to claim a prime vantage
point by t h e entrance.
star h a d b e e n expected to c o n d u c t t h e

unexpectedly after t h e death o f her ex-
h u s b a n d Sonny.
Cher w a s greeted by M o h a m m e d Al
Fayed, w h o gave her the customary floor

whilst her latest single 'Believe', w h i c h

every loudspeaker. In a sensational pub-
licity stunt, t h e entertainer w a s b o m -
barded by questions (she apparently ate

The h o n o u r o f inauguration rested
in the capable h a n d s o f Oscar-winning
diva Cher, w h o s e arrival coincided s o m e -
what ironically with a brass b a n d rendi-
tion o f ' W h e n I'm Sixty-Four' by t h e
Beatles (to b e fair, she's only 531). The
procession w a s r o u n d e d off with p o m p
and circumstance by horse-drawn car-
riages and a trio of bagpipers. The super-
Al Fayed 'Cher's a moment with the star

paparazzi. She posed beside brass door-
k n o b s , a d m i r e d a linen display a n d
grasped a china plate, by which time s h e
was extremely irritated with the persis-
tent m e d i a attention, exhausted from
t o t t e r i n g a r o u n d in her h i g h heels,
blinded by glaring flashlights a n d prob-
ably quite peckish.

ICU President Dave Hellard has c o m e
under attack in his attempt to re-organise
the Constituent College Unions. Senior
sources in all four Unions have spoken out
against what they see as an attempt to
undermine their "identity and substance".
S o m e have even seen this as a first move
in an attempt to completely disband the
CCUs.
M r Hellard first outlined his plans to
move most C C U clubs into direct ICU con-
trol at the December meeting of ICU Coun-
cil, since w h e n the stormclouds have slowly
gathered and opposition to any percieved
attack o n the power of the Constituent
Unions has mobilised. However, as M r
Hellard has been o n holiday for the last
four weeks, he has b e e n unable to react
to this criticism, or comment in his defence.
The most vocal opposition to M r Hel-
lard has c o m e from Royal School of Mines
President Alistair I-ox, w h o has written a
point for point re-buffal of M r Hellard's
proposals, which he believes "had n o fac-
tual basis other than what w o u l d appear
to be general sweeping innuendos". H e
also feels that s o m e of the c o m m e n t s M r
Hellard made in Felix at the end of last term
"suggest that the C C U Presidents are peo-
ple of substantially lower character w h o
cannot be relied u p o n " - a n d is unsurpris-
ingly annoyed by this attitude. He con-
cludes that "the underlying reason for the
suggested change... is the abolition of the
CCUs themselves".
In the other CCUs, opposition to M r
Hellard's proposals also face stiff (if less
vocal) resistance. Will Bentley, Royal College
of Science Union Vice-President, expressed
his concern with t h e methods M r Hellard
planned to use; "If the clubs were to be
given the choice o f whether or not to
move I would be in favour of the proposal,
but forcing them to move is clearly wrong".
Senior figures in the M e d School a n d City
and Guilds Unions have also pledged to
o p p o s e the scheme.
The real question, however, is still
over M r Hellard's long-term intentions, but
with M r Hcllard d u e back from holiday
today, a n d a m e e t i n g of ICU Council d u e
to take place t o m o r r o w night, his true
motives should s o o n b e c o m e apparent.
