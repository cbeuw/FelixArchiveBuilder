Star wars - Rogue Squadron (PC)
LucasArts
O n c e u p o n a time o n a g a m e s c o n s o l e
not that far a w a y a LucasArts g a m e
attempted to extend the Star Wars license
into t h e w o r l d o f 3 D shoot-em-ups. T h e
game. S h a d o w s o f t h e Empire, h a d a n
excellent start. S n o w s p e e d e r s firing at a
series o f probes, scouts a n d transports,
with b o n u s e s for bringing t h e m d o w n
with T o w cables a n d h a r p o o n s rather
than s h o o t i n g t h e m t o bits. U n f o r t u -
nately the g a m e had a dark side, a rather
poor and annoyingly frustrating series o f
single person stages w h e r e o n e mistake
would force y o u back to restart the w h o l e
10 minute level.
S o m e o n e back at LucasArts had obvi-
ously b e e n l i s t e n i n g to t h e cries o f
a n g u i s h f r o m t h e poor tortured souls
a n d d e c i d e d to take all o f the flying ele-
ments, mix a bit of 3 D card light side of
the force' m a g i c a n d release R o g u e
Squadron. R o g u e Squadron is not g o i n g
to give a n y o f t h e secrets f r o m t h e u p
a n d c o m i n g 'Chapter O n e ' film as it is set
just after t h e D e a t h Star g o t its just
deserts a n d b e f o r e t h e Empire struck
back. Y o u get t o play Luke w h o together
with W e d g e Antilles has just set u p a n
elite squadron w h o get to take o n all the
nasty a n d difficult missions. Missions that
will involve y o u flying the classic Y-wings,
X-wings, A-wings a n d S n o w S p e e d e r s
a l o n g with a very fast a n d very easy to
crash V-Wing.
This g a m e is not a n
X-wing, Tie-fighter or X
vs Tie g a m e . Pretty
m u c h all o f t h e mis-
s i o n s take place very
c l o s e to t h e g r o u n d
a n d e x p e c t i n g a nice
soft landing is not at all
part o f the g a m e plan.
So attack your targets
f r o m as near t h e
g r o u n d as p o s s i b l e by all
means, but try not to leave
bits o f your craft b e h i n d .
Another c h a n g e is the stan-
dard c a m e r a angle; it's posi-
tioned just b e h i n d t h e craft
a n d a l t h o u g h s o m e o f y o u
might switch t o t h e internal
view c a m e r a immediately it is
not all that clever a n idea as t h e g r o u n d
f r o m the internal v i e w rushes into v i e w
a little t o o quickly.
So apart from feeling like an arcade or
-pardon my w o r d s - a console game, h o w
g o o d actually is it? Well the graphics with
a decent 3 Dfx card a n d a pretty p o o r
processor are very impressive. It's not
quite the 'float m y boat' level that War-
gasm m a n a g e d to pour into m y eyes but
it passed the flinch test -1 leant into most
o f the turns. The s o u n d is also fairly - well
h o w else c a n it b e described - s o u n d : A
John Williams derived C D etched by a
scries o f engine, g u n and missile sounds.
The actual g a m e play is g o o d - shoot, mis-
sile (guided, t h o u g h usually unguided),
even tangle your e n e m i e s with the help
of t h e c o m p u t e r controlled w i n g m e n
before they m a n a g e to kill you or stop your
objectives being completed. Ihe problem
is that it all starts to get a bit predictable and
samey. Perhaps they m a k e it a little bit
m o r e difficult by placing y o u in a s n o w
speeder rather than a proper fighter as you
attempt to take o n e n e m y fighters, but
they arc still e n e m y fighters following the
same predictable path with little in the way
o f evasive m a n o e u v r i n g . It is a n A l prob-
lem a n d w h e n played next to s o m e t h i n g
like Half-life a very obvious problem. Still
if y o u loved Incoming f r o m last s u m m e r
or 3D flight Arcade g a m e s it will entertain
for m a n y hours as the levels b e c o m e pro-
gressively m o r e difficult. Star Wars obses-
sives will have probably already completed
it over Christmas.

Turok 2 - Seeds of Evil (N64)
Acclaim
Another s e q u e l o f a g a m e l a u n c h e d at
the d a w n o f t h e N64. Turok : Dinosaur
Hunter w a s t h e t o p d o g o f the c o n s o l e
3D first person shooter for ages. O n l y
O o l d e n e y e m a n a g e d to match a n d beat
it in t h e e y e c a n d y stakes. Turok 2 is
attempting to take this mantle back.
I his time Turok is back help-
ing h u m a n i t y by fighting intelli-
gent Dinosaurs and their masters
while preventing the o p e n i n g o f
Ba d i m e n s i o n a l p r i s o n , w h i c h
should it o p e n w o u l d w i p e our
universe out - o h well I s u p p o s e
two d e c e n t story lines in a w e e k
w o u l d b e spoiling m e . Turok has
m a n a g e d to get his hands o n
s o m e nice w e a p o n r y including
the cerebral bore - a w e a p o n
that h o m e s o n t o a b a d dino's
h e a d a n d d o c s a nice j o b in instant
t r e p a n n i n g - nice. A s well as a single
p e r s o n g a m e they have also included a
multiplayer o p t i o n w h i c h divides t h e TV
screen into halves a n d quarters m u c h in
the s a m e w a y as G o l d e n e y c . Unfortu-
nately t h e multiplayer a n d t h e single
player are not as g o o d as they
should b e . T h e first gripe is
the control m e t h o d . This abil-
ity to look u p , d o w n a n d
a r o u n d at t h e s a m e time as
r u n n i n g forward, backwards
a n d sideways is all fine a n d
dandy except that t h e n u m -
ber o f keys n e e d e d to d o s o

multiplayer g a m e s b e c o m e a m a s s o f

'what key does that' a n d ' h o w close they

R A M pack t h e graphics a r c not a h u g e
step forward, t h e buildings a p p e a r i n g

experiment using four students it w a s

m e n t really. N o t as m u c h f u n as G o l d -

well perhaps Turok 3 might b e better.

New Year News
Lara on your back
In her bid t o take over t h e w o r l d only currently surpassed by t h e Virgin train c o n -
troller, Richard Branson, Lara has taken time off f r o m exploring and launched a range
of clothing a n d accessories. Everything f r o m skinny T-Shirts to Dressing-gowns can
be p u r c h a s e d over t h e net a n d v i a their 24-hour credit card hotline. (Lara herself
answers f r o m 5 p m - 9am).
So it is true. You c a n have Lara o n your back, w r a p p e d round your wrist, against
your n a k e d s k i a . o o h err perhaps I s h o u l d just stop n o w .
iMac notebook ? (possibly maybe, probably yes)
f o l l o w i n g o n f r o m their f o r m over function runaway success in t h e i M a c (which will
s o o n c o m e in a series o f five different colours - tangerine m o u s e with puce m o n i -
tor case anyone?), the A p p l e press are gently hyping the i M a c styled portable - w h i c h
is r u m o u r e d to b e called W e b M a t e . All this despite A p p l e not giving it a s h o w i n g at
the M a c W o r l d expo. K n o w i n g Apple, expect it to look simular to the old e M a t c , with
a clam-shell case a n d a release date s o m e t i m e b e f o r e June/July ( t h o u g h if they start
to d o these in tangerine it might lead to several fashion-rage murders).
