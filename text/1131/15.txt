Phew, failing to get into t h e Christmas
edition m e a n s that I c a n miss o u t t h e
o b v i o u s 'Cracker' a n d ' S l e i g h i n g t h e
opposition' puns. If y o u o w n a semi-
decent PC m a c h i n e a n d have not played
or bought the g a m e then y o u have m a n -
a g e d to miss o n e o f t h e most brilliantly
underhyped a n d understated g a m e s .
The g a m e s c o m m u n i t y might have
raved about it, but that's b e e n t h e e n d
of it. Perhaps it's t h e rather unsexy m a l e
lead character - a postdoc Physics worker
has not really sent t h e popular press Into
a spin in t h e s a m e w a y that a large
breasted heroine might. C o u l d it b e the
cold clinical lab e n v i r o n m e n t that the
lead character has to fight his w a y out of
f o l l o w i n g a spectacularly crocked exper-
iment? A blown fuse in lab e q u i p m e n t or
a d o d g y test probe has n o t h i n g o n m a n -
a g i n g to o p e n d i m e n s i o n a l portals to
other worlds b r i m m i n g with harmful a n d
horrific creatures. Is it t h e fact that most
of the tabloid reviewers w e r e not able to
c o p e with the introduction sequence?
There is n o simple video introduction in
this g a m e as you wander along, travelling
to the lab c o m p l e x o n the monorail pick-
ing u p the rather useful
h a z a r d suit. T h e suit
m a n a g e s to d o u b l e as
a protective layer
b e t w e e n t h e nice, soft,
but easily crumpled soft
bits inside a n d t h e
harsh alien 'eat h u m a n '
world outside. Or is it
the slightly disturbing
way t h e hero handles a
crowbar? So for t h e
popular press to like it
they n e e d a large
b r e a s t e d lawyer, or
journalist, w h o battles
t h r o u g h an easy-on-
the-eye office complex
introduced using full
m o t i o n v i d e o or ani-
mation, o h yeah a n d
her crowbar action is
less frantic.
But d e s p i t e t h e
lack of popular press
support a n d IV, Cin-
e m a and Billboard ads,
it has b e e n o n e o f t h e b i g hits o f the
Christmas season purely because it is
just an excellent g a m e . Taking the quake
2 graphics engine, a n d bolting to it a
story line a n d s o m e quite clever Al, Valve
has taken the s h o o t i n g g a m e another
step forward.
Graphically a n d sonically the g a m e
hasn't m o v e d t h e g e n r e forward t o o far.
The s o o t h i n g voice o f the hazard suit
w a r n i n g system is a nice touch, a n d t h e
introduction of music to e m p h a s i s e d a n -
ger or excitement gives the g a m e a more
film like t o u c h . The Al o f t h e characters
f o u n d in the g a m e , both friendly a n d
hostile, also helps reinforce the m o v i e
experience. Talk to s o m e of the scientists
a n d security guards a n d they'll follow for
a while. The security guards carry s o m e
firepower o f their o w n w h i c h definitely
is an advantage, w h i l e t h e science staff
help out by o p e n i n g doors a n d k e e p i n g
y o u up to s p e e d o n t h e story line. The
e n e m i e s also react to your actions. N o
m o r e will t h e e n e m i e s perform suicidal
runs at the player. L n e m y grunts will try
to clear t h e area by l o b b i n g grenades
rather than r u n n i n g into a m b u s h e s . If
they get e x p o s e d to s u p p r e s s i o n fire
they will run a n d hide. It is just a very
g o o d 3 D first p e r s o n s h o o t i n g g a m e .
Let's h o p e that Valve get to w o r k o n
m o r e o f these.

Talonsoft
Talonsoft are the masters o f hex based
w a r g a m e s for t h e PC, with their Battle-
ground series, N o r m Koger's Operational
Art of War a n d Eastern Front (a world war
II campaign). Their latest release. West-
ern Front, is effectively Eastern Front but
shifted west a f e w h u n d r e d miles. Y o u
can play any o n e o f a h u g e series o f his-
torically accurate s c e n a r i o s in t h e W.
E u r o p e a n , M e d i t e r r a n e a n or N o r t h
African theatres, or as a c a m p a i g n o f
interlocking scenarios.
As expected, everything is detailed
to an incredible d e g r e e o f accuracy. T h e
scale o f the g a m e is a r o u n d battalion
level - y o u don't d e c i d e t h e strategy for
the w h o l e o f the Allied forces for e x a m -
ple, but are involved in small scale skir-
m i s h e s a n d battles.
There is a large, well
massive, n u m b e r o f
units, w h i c h all play
realistically. O f course,
I don't k n o w h o w real-
istic this is as I a m not
a WW2 veteran, but
there is n o point w h e r e
you scream at the c o m -
puter after an unrealis-
tic battle result. There is
a lot to appeal to die-
hard w a r g a m e r s , but
there is also something
in here for e v e r y o n e (well'almost every-
o n e . O r m o r e accurately - m o r e than
could be e x p e c t e d given t h e nature o f
the g a m e ) . It d o e s not take l o n g to get
into it, especially as the scenarios are all
graded. T h e training missions are quite
simple a n d get y o u to use your units
intelligently a n d as a t e a m - rather than
a l l o w i n g t h e e n e m y to pick t h e m off
o n e by o n e .
The presentation, especially for this
type o f g a m e , is extremely g o o d . The
m u s i c is atmospheric a n d quite exciting
w h e n played loud. The graphics are also
very g o o d a n d clear. This is certainly o n e
of the best w a r g a m e s available. Highly
r e c o m m e n d e d .

In the world of the Golf Simulator the var-
ious makers all a i m their g a m e s at dif-
ferent e n d s of t h e serious simulation
spectrum. At o n e e n d there is t h e jokey
Sensible Golf simulation, in the m i d d l e
is the slightly m o r e serious A c t u a Golf 3,
d e s i g n e d for t h e PSX market a n d a g e n -
tle introduction for the casual user. In the
hard user corner is definitely Access'
Links LS 99.
Here is a g a m e that takes itself so
very seriously. There are three different
ways to use the m o u s e to w h a c k t h e lit-
tle virtual ball along the green grass stuff.
There is e v e n a control m e t h o d that
involves rolling the m o u s e in a pretend
swing. It is a g a m e that allows the screen
resolution to be so high that only the
finest quality screens f r o m Y o k o h a m a
a n d t h e k e e n e s t v i d e o cards f r o m
M u n i c h c a n handle it without breaking
into tears. What w c have here is a very
serious Golf g a m e for the very seriously
rich Golfer. But don't let that put you off,
there are a m a z i n g l y a f e w fun features
- well f u n for Golf. C o m p e t e in a tour-
n a m e n t a n d crowds will cheer y o u o n ,
all while t h e occasional balloon or jet
flies into view. Miss a shot a n d try to get
your c o m p u t e r player to swear. All pos-
sibly clean f u n . but is it really all that
enjoyable ?
