Brightening Prospects
See the world, make a difference. Improve your CV and clear your conscience
Can travelling really be worthwhile? At
some point we all decide we want to see
the world, but even if we do actually go
anywhere only a few of us will ever do
anything useful. According to Claire Bayn-
tun, it doesn't have to be that way.
"I'm going travelling" is a claim m a d e regularly amongst
students in the university bars. W e ' r e all a well inten-
tioned lot, but t h e truth is that only o n e out o f every
five that talk about it actually get to t h e point o f filling
in their luggage labels. W h y is that?
N o o n e denies that g o i n g overseas a n d experi-
e n c i n g a different culture is a g o o d thing. In fact, the
c o n s e n s u s is that y o u are likely t o have a n outra-
geously f u n time, your m i n d will b e o p e n e d , your
character enriched... a n d o f course, our elders will all
chant "...Do it n o w while y o u still can..." A n d in that they
have a fair point.
So if y o u are d e t e r m i n e d to b e o n e o f the o n e s
that actually gets to hold the b o a r d i n g pass in your
(presently clean) hand, there remain t w o routes of over-
seas experience for y o u to c h o s e f r o m .
You have the option o f b u m m i n g your w a y a r o u n d
hostels, getting smelly, s t o n e d a n d progressively lazy.
Or at least that is fast b e c o m i n g t h e perception o f
e m p l o y e r s o n r e a d i n g "...been travelling..." o n a n
application form. A n d it is, let's face it, very often a fair
depiction of those months away. " W h o wants a job any-
way", will b e b e i n g uttered by t h o s e w h o have spent
too m a n y w e e k s o n the Thai Islands... g o a t e e beard,
no doubt, in place. It's not until y o u return h o m e , hav-
ing forgotten your m u m ' s birthday, d o g s funeral, a n d
little sister's confirmation, that y o u start to w o n d e r
whether y o u actually 'lost' your soul in the blissful haze
of beach a n d h a m m o c k , rather than 'discovering it' as
y o u h a d m e a n t to!
There is a n o t h e r w a y t o s o a k y o u r s e l f w i t h i n
another culture, w h i l e keeping-up-appearances for
your future prospects.
Teaching Abroad a n d Projects A b r o a d are an organ-
isation which allows your time overseas to be structured
and worthwhile, both to yourself (building u p your CV,
making clearer j u d g e m e n t s o n your abilities a n d inten-
tions in life), a n d to t h e c o m m u n i t y to w h i c h y o u
c h o o s e to go. They have arranged over 3000 voluntary
work placements in India, G h a n a , M e x i c o , Brazil, China,
Tibet, Ukraine, Siberia a n d Russia. You are provided with
food a n d a c c o m m o d a t i o n with a local family, immers-
ing y o u within t h e culture a n d c o m m u n i t y .
The most popular p l a c e m e n t s are t e a c h i n g c o n -
versational English in schools, to a range o f a g e s (no
TEFL qualification required - w h i c h saves hundreds, if not
thousands, o f pounds), conservation projects, a n d (lis-
ten up M e d i c s yet to arrange your Electives) work in hos-
pitals. Additionally, there is a stock o f limited placements
available in areas such as j o u r n a l i s m , accountancy,
law, e n g i n e e r i n g , FT., a n d hotel m a n a g e m e n t . . . There
is the option o f c o m b i n i n g p r o g r a m m e s , a n d whatever
your placement, y o u c h o s e the dates that y o u want for
your travel a n d p r o g r a m , with p l a c e m e n t s possible
from o n e m o n t h u p to a year.
As with a n y trip overseas, y o u have to provide
your o w n funds, but in paying for all your essential
e x p e n s e s u p front (food, a c c o m m o d a t i o n a n d insur-
ance) y o u d o not have the difficulty o f b u d g e t i n g while
o n the road. You have the security o f paid staff in your
destination for backup a n d welfare, a l o n g with the
assurity o f m e e t i n g u p with other like-minded v o l u n -
teers. Generally g o o d sorts!
As for w h e r e y o u are g o i n g - THEY NEED Y O U . O n e
volunteer w h o w a s recently w o r k i n g in a remote village
in G h a n a w a s m a d e a Tribal Chief, such w a s his impact
(as covered by The Daily Express, Sky TV a n d This M o r n -
ing). You will receive a heart felt w e l c o m e from the local
c o m m u n i t y that y o u live a n d w o r k with; they are grate-
ful for your voluntary contribution, as they can not
afford to pay y o u . Everyone gains f r o m the cultural
e x c h a n g e , a n d in staying in o n e place y o u get to build
up relationships a n d k n o w l e d g e that w o u l d be impos-
sible to achieve by simply travelling thr oug h . Ihe b e n -
efits are long term as well as short term - s o m e t h i n g
that should help your family and friends accept that y o u
are g o i n g .
As y o u arc only c o m m i t t e d to w o r k i n g 18 hours per
w e e k ( M o n d a y to I riday) y o u have plenty of free time
to tour around your region, a n d indeed, to discover your
soul! A n d I suggest that y o u g o o n to travel m o r e o n
c o m p l e t i n g your placement, either alone or with other
volunteers, safe in the k n o w l e d g e that y o u have s o m e -
thing highly regarded o n your CV. Each destination
offers a feast o f sights a n d different cultural experiences
for y o u to explore that must not be missed.
If this d o e s w h e t your appetite, a n d makes the
important d i f f e r e n c e b e t w e e n talking a b o u t it a n d
