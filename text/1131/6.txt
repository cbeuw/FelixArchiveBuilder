s h a m p o o a n d conditioner in o n e bottle
is about as w i s e as putting m a l e a n d

For those o f y o u w h o g r e w to adult-

the social s t i g m a that o n e brought o n
oneself back t h e n by c o n t i n u i n g to take

nerable a n d sensitive t e e n a g e r I w a s
painfully a w a r e o f t h e terrible risk I w a s

my lack o f a u faitness with this revolu-

I m a n a g e d to k e e p

Dreft.
But with t h e
birth o f this n e w
c o n c e p t - "Wash
a n d G o " w i t h o u t
the conditioner, I feel a great weight lift-
ing f r o m m y shoulders. "Solo" - as this
counter-revolutionary hair treatment is
called - represents t h e sort of U-turn o f
w h i c h politicians c a n only d r e a m a n d is
m a r k e t e d in a w a y that w o u l d cause
Peter M a n d e l s o n to stifle m o a n s o f
ecstasy (which is fine by m e as l o n g as
it doesn't affect his ability to d o his job).
If t h e issue in question w e r e a political
policy rather than a personal hygiene
product, Vidal Sasoon w o u l d b e ripped
to shreds by t h e m e d i a . Even t h e y o u t h -
ful, follically disadvantaged leader o f Her
Majesty's O p p o s i t i o n , w h o usually dis-
plays all t h e political a c u m e n o f a sheet
of g r e a s e p r o o f paper, couldn't fail to
m a k e political capital out o f such a bla-
tant turnaround. O n e can't help but w o n -
der what Jeremy Paxman w o u l d m a k e o f
this if h e c o u l d get t h e head o f the C o n -
sumer B a m b o o z l i n g Department at Vidal
Sassoon in front o f t h e cameras:
Paxman: "Yeeesssss. But isn't this
Matt Salter
"Take two bottles
into the shower? The
answer would now
seems to be 'Yes'."
m o v e a c o m p l e t e reversal
of your earlier O n e C o n -
tainer-Two Detergent pol-
icy? I m e a n , it's a bit o f a b l o o d y c h e e k
isn't it?"
Worried ad-exec "No, n o . N o t at all.
The central principle o f unitary cleansing
is still very m u c h there.
The n a m e itself - "Solo"
- clearly u n d e r l i n e s
that point...."
Paxman. " O h
c o m e on, M r . Earnalot,
surely this is a blatant
attempt to e n c r o a c h
o n t h e c o s m e t i c terri-
tory o f your competitors, w h o have l o n g
maintained that the distinction b e t w e e n
the role o f t h e c l e a n i n g agent o n t h e
o n e h a n d , a n d t h e conditioner o n the
other s h o u l d b e clearly d e f i n e d . Isn't
this just a case o f g o o d b y e Vidal - A l o e
Vera?"
Earnalot: "I prefer to think o f it as
" N e w Lather - N e w Bathtime" Jeremy. N o
but seriously, I'd like to e v a d e that ques-
tion in t w o w a y s if I may. Firstly, W e
have always maintained that in order to
tackle follicle
u n c l e a n l i n e s s y o u
must have a long-
t e r m strategy in
place that d e a l s
with the root cause
of t h e p r o b l e m .
Look, t h e latest
two-wave approach
d o e s not d a m a g e
the very close a n d
important ties that
s h a m p o o a n d c o n -
ditioner have with each other, it is merely
a m o v e t o w a r d s d e v o l v i n g c l e a n i n g
p o w e r a n d giving t h e t w o ingredients
greater a u t o n o m y within t h e b a t h r o o m
as a whole."
Paxman: "But M r . Larna.."
Earnalot: "If I might b e allowed to fin-
ish. Secondly, there is t h e question o f
c o n s u m e r choice. Being in manufactur-
ing m e a n s that y o u have to b e prepared
to take t o u g h decisions, a n d it m a y b e
that there is a case for l o o k i n g at t h e
w h o l e c o n c e p t o f universal scalp b e n e -
fit. I have instructed m y t e a m to unthink
the thinkable."
Paxman: " H o w d o y o u answer t h e
charge m a d e by s o m e of your c o m p e t i -
tors, a n d you've n o d o u b t seen t h e ads,
that this latest about face marks a d o
facto return to a m o r e traditional style o f
hair-washing a n d will inevitably lead to
a m o v e back to t h e use o f older, less
mild-acting surfactants in the products
c o n c e r n e d . A n d t h e worry is that this
"...I was rehabilitated,
only to be sent back to
the Gulag when the
combined-washing-pow
der-and-fabric-softener
craze hit our school..."
"Back to Caustics" c a m p a i g n will lead to
an increase in t h e n u m b e r o f reported
i n c i d e n c e s o f split ends, follicle d a m -
a g e a n d less efficient cleansing overall.
It's n o t h i n g m o r e than t w o tier cleaning
by t h e back d o o r isn't it?"
Earnalot: " N o , n o . Let m e m a k e it
quite clear. There is n o threat to t h e
quality o f t h e product as a w h o l e a n d to
suggest that there is, is simply irrespon-
sible scare m o n g e r i n g . O u r p o s i t i o n
remains as it has always b e e n ; there will
be n o d r o p in c l e a n s i n g p o w e r - w e are
t o u g h o n grime, t o u g h o n t h e causes of
grime.
Paxman: " D o y o u envisage a time
w h e n t h e t w o constituents m i g h t b e
reunited?"
Earnalot: "If s u c h a m o v e occurs,
a n d it's a b i g if, I think that it's s o m e w a y
off. A l t h o u g h w e are not o p p o s e d to the
idea o f a reunification in principle, w e
feel that t h e current situation - with
s h a m p o o a n d c o n d i t i o n e r w o r k i n g in
close partnership, with t h e help o f the
l e m o n s h o w e r gels - is right for o u r c o m -
pany. W e w o u l d only m o v e into a Single
C o m b i n a t i o n w h e n it w a s right a n d pru-
dent to d o so."
Paxman-. "So
rather than "Wash
a n d G o " , it's m o r e
a case o f "Wait a n d
See". M r . Earnalot-
t h a n k y o u . Well,
the first editions of
s o m e o f the m o r n -
ing papers are in
a n d "
Or s o m e t h i n g
o f t h e sort. H o w -
ever, t h e m a r k e t i n g boys are rarely sub-
jected to the s a m e kind of scrutiny as our
elected representatives. If they were,
they m i g h t have b e e n p u s h e d rather
harder to explain t h e process w h e r e b y
u s i n g Flash o n your filthy kitchen floor
not only results in your lino c o m i n g up
sparkling clean but also leads t o the
w h o l e r o o m b e i n g redecorated a n d flo-
ral curtains b e i n g h u n g at t h e w i n d o w s .
Similarly, p e r h a p s Kotex w o u l d have

to w e a r white trousers a n d run a l o n g a
b e a c h with long, l o p i n g strides b e i n g
pulled a l o n g by t w o G o l d e n Retrievers.
In t h e face o f such relentless investiga-
tion, Vidal Sasoon might e v e n b e forced
to explain w h y t h e instructions o n an
original bottle o f no-fuss, one-stop "Wash
a n d G o " advised y o u to apply t h e prod-
uct t o "wet hair a n d w o r k u p into a
