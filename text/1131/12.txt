BUILT TO SPILL
Keep It Like A SecretE
T
he m e d i a splurge reads s o m e -
thing like this: 'Built T o Spill's last
a l b u m , t h e epic Perfect From
Now On, must surely stand as o n e o f
the decade's finest guitar albums , a
m o n u m e n t a l testimony to t h e p o w e r o f
the rock tradition. Fact.' Well, if that is t o
be believed then their follow-up a l b u m .
Keep It Like A Secret must surely stand
as o n e o f t h e d e c a d e ' s most m o n u -
mental c o m e d o w n s . Fact. I'm not say-
ing that t hey'r e crap. It's just that
they're not really t h e saviours o f t h e
rock tradition. A half d e c e n t rock b a n d
is what they are - plain a n d simple.
Anyway, that's all b a s e d o n w h a t t h e
music press says a n d w h o reads that
nowadays, eh?
W e i g h i n g in at a fairly lightweight
fifty minutes Keep It Like A Secret c o n -
tains eleven tracks with only o n e track
over six minutes long. They a r e pretty
m u c h all p o p s o n g s a n d t h e band's p o p
sensibilities w o r k well with t h e vocalist's
distinctively A m e r i c a n t w i n g e . T h e
rhythm guitar w o r k is fairly solid through-
out while t h e lead is quite often stratos-
pheric prompting a quick burst of the old
air guitar routine.
You Were Right is probably the stand-
out track o n Keep It Like A Secret. M u c h
like t h e rest o f t h e a l b u m it d o e s n ' t fol-
low the usual verse-chorus-verse tradition
that rock trios t e n d t o g o for. They're a
rock trio, b y t h e way. Just in case y o u
w e r e w o n d e r i n g . T h e s o n g basically
trawls out s o m e old rock lyrics and forms
t h e m into a s o n g : 'You w e r e right w h e n
y o u said that all that glitters isn't gold.
You w e r e right w h e n y o u said that we're
all just bricks in t h e wall. Y o u w e r e right
w h e n y o u said that y o u can't always get
w h a t y o u want. Y o u w e r e w r o n g w h e n
y o u said that everything is g o n n a b e
alright.' For t h e record, they originally
b e l o n g to L e d Z e p p e l i n , Pink Floyd, T h e
Rolling S t o n e s (I think that's w r o n g ,
t h o u g h . Answers o n a postcard to Felix
please or else it'll b u g m e for ages) a n d
The Beatles respectively. Strangely, this
is o n e o f t h e longer songs. That isn't a n
e n d o r s e m e n t o f t h e lengthier variety as
most o f the decent tunes are the shorter
poppier o n e s .
All together, however. Built To Spill
fall short o f b e i n g s o m e t h i n g special.
They're a bit average. Keep It Like A
Secret is g o o d but it c a n get very dull
quickly. There's definitely promise here
a n d t h e w h i s t l i n g at t h e e n d o f t h e
a l b u m is e n o u g h t o m a k e y o u laugh. It's
alright but that's it. CI

BELLATRIX
F
act o n e : Iceland's w o m e n far out-
n u m b e r its m e n . Icelandic
w o m e n are apparently generally
O K with m e n w h o double-date b e c a u s e
not s o m a n y o f t h e m are in circulation
anyway. Fact two: Bellatrix is a five-piece
all-girl Icelandic band that is very g o o d
at t h e usual p o p m u s i c routine o f
catchy m e l o d i e s a n d nice vocals. From
fact t w o w e c a n d e d u c e that they are
destined for success. K e e p i n g fact o n e
in m i n d , c a n w e then hazard a g u e s s
that this is all but a subtle ploy t o find
themselves a wider c h o i c e o f m e n ?
Bcllatrix e m p l o y all sorts o f p o p -
music tricks t o m a k e their m u s i c a n d
songs interesting. The s c r e e c h i n g gui-
tars, the violins, the whirling synthesiser
sounds, t h e chunky beats, a n d not least,
a g o o d lead vocalist (Bjork-esquc?) are all
used to g o o d effect. The fact is, h a d I
b e e n inclined t o dismiss t h e m , I w o u l d -
n't have b e e n able to say they are b a d
imitators o f others.
T h e o p e n i n g track Silvcrlight is a
nice s m o o t h introduction to the a l b u m
with its s e a r c h i n g guitar c h o r d s a n d
vocals. Lyrics like T don't h a v e a n y
answers a n d I c a n t s e e far a h e a d ' are
ominously prophetic. Perhaps they k n o w
they could b e marketed well a n d this is
a h u g e disclaimer in that they have n o
masterplan whatsoever. Another dimen-
sion is a cheerful s o n g full o f s w e e p i n g
fast beats a n d m a n y a chorus line. This
is the sort o f stuff that m a k e s y o u start
to have a bit more faith in the n e w music
that's c o m i n g through nowadays. A Sting
starts with a very nice chorus a n d g o e s
o n to create the 'rollercoaster ride' effect
the lyrics s i n g of. Great Expectations
mixes pile-driving guitars, quick beats,
a n d folksy violins into a g o o d song.
The trouble with bands like this is it'll
take a l o n g time for t h e m t o get recog-
nised, l o o often today w e just p l u m p for
the n a m e s w e k n o w w h e n w e ' r e trawl-
ing the record shops. I don't k n o w h o w
long it will take for Bellatrix to be well-
k n o w n , if ever, but I think they are as
g o o d as a n y t h i n g out there, a n d h o p e -
fully c a n only get better. CI

Singles
Sebadoh - Flame
American rock s e e m s stuck in the mixture o f chirpy opti-
mism a n d p o u n d i n g guitars that is s o m e t i m e s called
post-grunge. Sebadoh are n o exception. They've got the
vocal s o u n d spot o n (Imagine t h e bloke w h o s a n g
Knock On Wood) but luckily a s t o m p i n g drumbeat pulls
the s o n g r o u n d t o m a k e a n enjoyable listen.
The Levellers - One Way
Originally r e c o r d e d in 1991, this re-recorded version
echoes t h e b a g g y s o u n d f r o m that era, with nice n e w
percussive bits to bring it u p t o date. The track serves
as a Sweetest Thing style taster for t h e Greatest Hits
a l b u m that is o u t at t h e m o m e n t .
The Mutton Birds - Pulled Along By Love
A bit singer-songwriter-ish. A bit C r o w d e d H o u s e ; they
c o m e from N e w Zealand. A bit rootsy-bluesy-trying-not-
to-be-pop-while-stlll-being-mainstream. N o t a bit origi-
nal.
@tomika - Dead Flowers
Don't y o u just hate bands with clever s m a r m y n a m e s
like that? Their s o n g better b e rubbish. O h g o o d , it is.
It's like t h o s e G u i d e To Being A Rock Star lot trying to
s o u n d like H a n s o n trying t o s o u n d like Nirvana. N o t
g o i n g to work, is it?

Lowcraft- One Of Us
A rare treat - an A m e r i c a n band playing a twisted c o n -
coction of glam rock a n d psychedelia. Comparisons will
be drawn with Placebo a n d Suede, but that d o c s little
to describe t h e spectral tower o f s o u n d s in this song,
w h i c h draw f r o m t h e best o f Ziggy-era Bowie.
Regular Fries - Fries Entertainment
Apparently supporting t h e Lo-Fidelity Allstars o n a LJ.k.
tour, Regular Fries c a n expect t o receive a certain
a m o u n t o f critical acclaim. The s o u n d is the usual wash
of ambient a n d big-beat s o u n d s that helped their head-
liners gain success last year. Y o u will b e hearing m o r e
f r o m these guys in the future, I p r o m i s e .
Liberty 37 - Revolution
A n enthusiastic hard rock g r o u p f r o m Swansea, Liberty
37 escape f r o m the confines o f metal by a d d i n g seduc-
tive melodic twists onto the t h u m p i n g raw power of this
their s e c o n d single. CI

Music Meetings
The first meeting of term will be held
at one-thirty in Felix on Monday. That
should actually be today if you pick this up
on the day of release. From then on, it will
revert back to the usual time of one-thirty
on a Friday. We look forward to seeing you
all there. Thank you for your time.
