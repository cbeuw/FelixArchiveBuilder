Hello, Good Morning, and
Welcome Back
As y o u enter your first lecture o f this
premillcnial year, clutching this s o m e -
what slim issue o f Felix, I h o p e y o u have
f o n d m e m o r i e s o f the Christmas break,
and few m e m o r i e s o f the N e w Year. A
particularly w a r m w e l c o m e g o e s to any-
o n e w h o contributed t o Felix last term...
you k n o w w h e r e t o c o m e w h e n revi-
sion gets o n top o f y o u . S p e a k i n g o f
which, if y o u have t h o u g h t o f contribut-
ing t o Felix but just haven't got a r o u n d
to it, now's the time! Exams can be a dis-
ruptive i n f l u e n c e o n all c l u b s in t h e
Spring term, and Felix is n o exception; s o
please, if y o u aren't w a d i n g t h r o u g h
t h e r m o d y n a m i c s p o p by the office for a
c o f f e e a n d write s o m e t h i n g .
Equal Ops - the New Sexism?
The ' W o m e n in Science' article (page 8)
has started m e thinking. W h y should
w o m e n enter science? T h e basic
a s s u m p t i o n b e i n g m a d e in all the argu-
ments is that w o m e n arc just as suited
to science as m e n . It may b e unfash-
ionable to question this assumption, but
I w e a r a n O x f a m jacket, s o question it I
shall; w o m e n d o think differently (not
better, not worse) than m e n . If it is true
that there a r e s o m e skills that s h o w a
gender bias, are w e right to expect equal
opportunities, w h i c h often translates as
50:50 ratios?
M o r e interestingly, if w o m e n d o
possess different mental abilities to m e n ,
it s e e m s to m e lhal the cause o f 'West-
ern' sexism is clear. O u r society under-
values those skills possessed mostly by
w o m e n , a n d thus discriminates against
w o m e n in g e n e r a l . Rather than pre-
t e n d i n g that there are n o (mental) dif-
ferences b e t w e e n the sexes, a n d h i d i n g
t h e m under t h e 'Equal O p p o r t u n i t i e s '
banner, wouldn't it b e better if w e c o n -
centrated o n c h a n g i n g our society's val-
ues instead? C o m m e n t s a n d
constructive criticism w e l c o m e .
