Why Should We Even Bother?
Susannah Humfrey wonders if science has anything to offer the fairer sex
T
he g e n d e r balance in science a n d t e c h n o l o g y is
not reflective o f t h e p o p u l a t i o n . This is extremely
obvious in this college. If you're f e m a l e in certain
departments you can feel a little, well, conspicuous. The
College runs endless recruitment drives a i m e d at 6th
form girls under t h e auspices o f WISE a n d has started
to spread its gospel to year 9 girls (the year they c h o o s e
their GCSEs). It seems to be taken for granted that more
girls should enter science. The q u e s t i o n of w h y still
remains.
A classic example of the folly of positive discrimination
There are t w o m a i n lines o f a r g u m e n t over w h y
increasing t h e numerical proportion o f w o m e n in sci-
ence is beneficial. The first is c o n c e r n e d with n u m b e r s .
If y o u exclude half t h e p o p u l a t i o n y o u exclude half o f
all potential scientists. If t h e p o o l o f talent f r o m w h i c h
scientists are drawn is half w h a t it c o u l d b e , t h e over-
all quality o f t h e scientists trained is similarly r e d u c e d .
Therefore if m o r e w o m e n are e n t e r i n g science that
means there will b e m o r e g o o d scientists. If there are
more g o o d scientists there will be m o r e g o o d science.
The s e c o n d line o f a r g u m e n t is that w o m e n think
in a different way. This different m o d e o f thought leads
w o m e n to have special skills. If w o m e n enter science
then they will bring these special skills to science.
These special skills are generally l u m p e d under that
delightful term f e m i n i n e intuition (thinking by another
name?). This f e m i n i n e intuition is thought in s o m e w a y
to enable better science to occur.
These arguments explain suggest w h y having m o r e
w o m e n w o u l d be g o o d for science. They fail to explain
w h y studying science is g o o d for w o m e n . Girls t e n d
not to c h o o s e science, t h e p r o g r a m m e s run by WISE
s e e m to exist t o entice w o m e n into t h e subject. Girls
are b e i n g actively p e r s u a d e d into science. What is it
about science that is s o unattractive to females? It is
unattractive to enter a n d apparently unpleasant to
w o r k in given by t h e rate o f w o m e n leaving t h e sub-
ject. It appears that there is s o m e t h i n g m o r e funda-
mentally w r o n g . It appears that the entire edifice
called Science is unsuited to most w o m e n . This unsuit-
ability is contained in t h e set up o f the institutions of
science. The universities, research institutes, publica-
tion methods, grant a w a r d i n g bodies a n d t h e w a y in
w h i c h scientific k n o w l e d g e is presented. This is not
unlikely, after all science w a s set u p by m e n for m e n ,
in an a g e w h e n w o m e n w e r e excluded as a matter o f
course. If science is a male construct a n d it is unsuited
to w o m e n , w h y are w e pressurising girls to take science?
It seems to m e that the main reason for encourag-
ing more w o m e n to enter science has been the belief
that equal opportunities is the same thing as numerical
representation. If fifty percent of undergraduates enter-
ing science are female then there is no discrimination
g o i n g on. I d o not believe this is true. Even if half the
undergraduates were to be female I d o not believe they
have equal opportunities while the structure o f science
is such that most of t h e m e n d up leaving the field. There
are very f e w w o m e n in the higher echelons of science.
This is unlikely to improve while science remains a sub-
ject inimicable to w o m e n . To have truly equal opportu-
nities in the realm of science there needs to be a dramatic
change to the institutions o f science. Without an equal
opportunity to succeed, without an equal opportunity to
get the very grant that enables us to carry o n working in
the field there will be never be a substantial n u m b e r of
w o m e n in the field. Unless the current situation in sci-
ence is changed there is little point in trying to recruit more
Lady Ada Byron Lovelace: I bet she would use LINUX
girls. I o actively e nc our a g e girls into a field that slams a
door in their face o n c e they have got there is not only a
perverse desire but a sadistic o n e . W e are lying to girls
about the wonderful time a n d careers they c a n have in
science. W e are actively encouraging t h e m to waste their
time o n a pipe dream. If t h e field is intrinsically biased
against us, w h y should w e bother with science?
Subliminal messaging? Or are those women In the background for a more Innocent reason? [Photo: IC Prospectus]
