BLONDIE
Music 11 January 1999
No Exit
A long time ago In a galaxy far far away..
M
any o f y o u m a y have thought that Blondie
w e r e s o m e band f r o m the seventies. You're
w r o n g . They're actually a fresh n e w band
ready to attack the music s c e n e with s o m e innovative
sonic musings. Seriously, t h o u g h , this is the band that
a r o u n d fifteen years a g o w e r e o n e o f the most influ-
ential bands a r o u n d . There's a terrible stigma attached
to bands that reform years after their prime. They tend
to be seen as milking past glories. A Greatest Hits
package last year could lead p e o p l e to think that this
is w h a t they're doing. That's far t o o cynical, t h o u g h .
You get the feeling that this is actually for real. What
actually h a p p e n e d w a s in the spring o f 1998 the four
original m e m b e r s met u p a n d d e c i d e d to let past dif-
ferences lie. They entered the studio a n d this is what
they m a n a g e d to c o m e out with, No Exit.
The q u e s t i o n is w h e t h e r it's a n y g o o d . A l b u m
o p e n e r . Screaming Skin, s o u n d s promising. There's a
Madness-like guitar riff jolting through the intro a n d
then w e hear D e b b i e Harry's familiar voice getting car-
ried a l o n g by what can only be described as a reggae
quickstep rhythm. This is a red herring, t h o u g h . N o t h -
ing else o n the a l b u m s o u n d s remotely like it. Forgive
and Forget o p e n s with w h a t is surely a rip-off o f a N e w
Order riff. Unfortunately, what follows is not a N e w
O r d e r s o n g . It's just an average t h r o w a w a y s o n g -
s o m e t h i n g m o r e suited to a b-side or perhaps e v e n an
a l b u m filler! The p r o b l e m with it is that there is n o spark
a n d this is what is missing f r o m several s o n g s o n the
a l b u m . It's a r u n n i n g t h e m e that s h o u l d have b e e n
s t o p p e d in its tracks before the s o n g s w e r e c o m m i t t e d
to tape.
The title track o p e n s with s o m e classical music
that I'm sure others will b e able to recognise instantly
but the n a m e o f it eludes m e . Anyway, f r o m there
things really g o downhill. It can only be described as very
poor. What w e get is D e b b i e Harry trying to rap! I
m e a n , for Christ's Sake! I k n o w critics tend to slate old
artists trying n e w things b e c a u s e they see it as an
attempt to w i n over the y o u n g a u d i e n c e s o I d e c i d e d
to listen to it again with a m o r e o p e n m i n d a n d my fears
w e r e c o n f i r m e d - the title track is terrible! N o question.
I think the p r o b l e m m a y have b e e n that they tried
to get everything o n t o record without filtering out the
duffers. There are actually a handful o f decent tracks
but o n c e y o u e x p e r i e n c e the crap ones, y o u don't
have the heart to slog through a n d find the gems. Noth-
ing Is Real But The Girl is reminiscent o f the Blondie o f
old - that's a g o o d thing, by the way. Double Take is also
g o o d because y o u can hear t h e b a n d gelling together
rather than D e b b i e ' s voice pervading all. It's the sort o f
mature track that they should be writing now. Obviously
it's not g o i n g to turn the kids o n but at least this w a y
y o u don't e n d up e m b a r r a s s i n g yourselves.
I like the Blondie o f old a lot w h i c h is probably w h y
I'm b e i n g a tad harsh o n this their 'modernisation.' The
fact remains that o n c e your fire's g o n e out, there's n o
point rekindling it unless you're g o i n g to m a k e it burn
brighter. A n d burn brighter, No Exit d o e s not. d

Out Of Tune
This Is what the album cover looks
like. Don't say you couldn't find it.
W
ell well, this turned out to be a nice little
g e m o f an a l b u m . I think the trick is simplici-
ty itself. It's only nine s o n g s long, l o o often,
bands just tack an extra c o u p l e o f tracks o n to m a k e
their a l b u m the 'right length.' Size isn't everything,
y o u know. What w e ' v e got here is a collection o f
acoustic based tracks that range f r o m upbeat to, well,
d o w n b e a t . I admit that at times, the vocalist slips into
a B o b Dylan s o u n d but that's just splitting hairs.
O p e n e r , Who Do You Love, strums itself into a
lovely s o n g that asks you to look at yourself: 'Would y o u
like w h o y o u w e r e if y o u met t h e m s o m e p l a c e ? W o u l d
y o u recognise the lines o n a stranger's face?' I k n o w
all this soul-searching turns people off because they s e c
it as part of the pre-millenial packaging that musical
artists a n d others alike are trying to cash in o n . H o w -
ever, Mojave3 c o m e across as very g e n u i n e a n d not in
the least contrived. That's a c o m m o d i t y that p e o p l e try
very hard to create without success. Mojave3 s e e m to
achieve it effortlessly.
The lyrical content o f the a l b u m is mostly relation-
ship based. Give What You Take is your basic love
s o n g : T h e r e ' s a light in your eyes that fills m e with life.
There's a lovin' in y o u that makes m e w a n n a fly.' Again,
I k n o w it sounds cheesy but w h e n y o u hear it, y o u k n o w
it's for real. Some Kinda Angel e c h o e s the s a m e sort of
'love is the ultimate salvation' t h e m e : ' A n d y o u w e r e
s o m e kinda a n g e l , y o u t o o k m e aside, said h e y never-
m i n d , I'll m a k e y o u feel better.' In contrast there are
m o r e bitter pills in the a l b u m . Yer Feet sees the singer
c o n t e m p l a t i n g the aftermath o f a failed relationship: T
n e e d s o m e t h i n g solid I c a n hold like a d o g that c o m e s
w h e n I call but I don't n e e d y o u . '
The strength o f Mojave3 is in the beauty o f their
songs. T h e s o u n d is simple. O r g a n s a n d pianos a c c o m -
pany an acoustically s t r u m m e d rhythm section. There
are n o electric guitars or funky loops z i p p i n g in a n d out
of tracks s o if you're after musical exhiliration you've
c o m e to the w r o n g h o u s e . If, however, you're looking
for musical salvation, Out Of Fune is an o p e n h o u s e
waiting for y o u to c o m e in. Quietly brilliant. CI
