The Good LPs Will Out? Bring The Hits On! If You Tolerate Shut Up!
So, what the hell Is happening In the music world this year? Felix took time out over the holidays and did some research into what's getting released and who's releasing it. Some of the big guns are getting their act together and the rest are ready to assault the shelves of your local record store. Let's have a look, shall we....
T
he best w a y to d o this is probably in alphabeti-
cal order. So, let's cut out all the musical b a n -
ter a n d get o n with it. Take a d e e p breath....
Beck is set to release his follow-up t o Mutations
s o m e w h e r e around June/July. Those not keen o n Muta-
tions because it a p p e a r e d to be a 'scrapbook o f patchy
songs written before his next major release' will be look-
ing for a return t o the fresh, innovative a n d slightly
eccentric Beck.
Bellatrlx are o n e o f the n e w kids o n the block. You'll
find a review o f their e p o n y m o u s l y titled mini-album in
this issue o f Felix. They're f r o m Iceland, they're m a d e
up almost entirely o f w o m e n a n d h o p e f u l l y they'll
c o m e g o o d in 1999. Thank G o d s o m e record executive
has g o n e to Iceland!
Bentley Rhythm Ace will release their next a l b u m
s o m e t i m e in M a r c h . They don't have a title for it as yet.
In fact, they don't even have a w o r k i n g title. A f e w
tracks have b e e n n a m e d - Am I Black Country Enough
For You?and Duck-web and Fish-lip. Strange pair of boys,
they are! Apparently, there are s o m e interesting col-
laborations but that's all b e i n g kept a bit hush-hush.
The Beta Band are in t h e studio n o w . Expectations
run high with this band after the ' u n d e r g r o u n d ' success
of their Three EPs c o m p i l a t i o n . In particular The Patty
Patty Sound EP. w h i c h w a s c h a m p i o n e d by our o w n stu-
dent radio station, ICRadio, c a u s e d a comfortable stir
amongst t h e listening masses. Their debut a l b u m is
nearing c o m p l e t i o n a n d s h o u l d be out in t h e first half
of the year.
Beth Orton's lovely single, Someone's Daughter
and her guest vocals o n The Chemical Brothers' Dig Your
Own Hole a l b u m h e l p e d to raise her profile in 1998.
Let's h o p e s h e progresses further in 1999. Her n e w
a l b u m features collaborations with Everything But The
Girl's Ben Wyatt a n d B e n Harper. For those that liked
Trailer Park, this a l b u m , Central Reservation, will b e
right up your street. She describes it as 'an extension
of the first a l b u m , a refinement o f that s o u n d . '
Bubble-gum p o p artists Bis will release their next
album next m o n t h . It's called Social Dancing and it looks
as if the single Action and Drama will precede it. Expect
the s a m e as usual f r o m this lot. Y o u either like it or y o u
don't by n o w .
BJork s e e m s to be k e e p i n g herself busy d u r i n g t h e
first half o f '99. She's releasing a n a l b u m o f love songs,
of which s o m e m a y be covers. She's also starring in a n d
writing the soundtrack t o t h e musical Dancer In The
Dark, w h i c h is o n general release next year. She's also
recorded an E P w i t h Digital Hardcore's Alec Empire. In
the midst of all this, she's h o p i n g to start w o r k o n her
fourth a l b u m proper. It's not easy b e i n g a popstar, y o u
k n o w .
Blur are back in business o n M a r c h 1 with a n e w
seven-minute-plus single. It's called Tender and will pre-
c e d e their as yet untitled sixth studio a l b u m , w h i c h
appears in t h e s h o p s in the s a m e m o n t h . This is their
first release in over a year so all I can say is that it's about
bloody time.
T h o s e c h e e k y Liverpudlians, Cast, return t o t h e
music scene after b e i n g away for just over a year with
their n e w a l b u m . Midget Allah. It s h o u l d b e released
a r o u n d April. Track titles are typically in the John Power
vein. Chasing The Day, Dreamer. o n e could g o o n .
In fact, if y o u take t h e w o r d s d r e a m , free, soul, shine,
star, away and day a n d construct a phrase of s o m e sort,
you're well o n the w a y to n a m i n g a Cast song. Seriously
t h o u g h , it's t h e music that counts a n d I'm sure thev'll
be pleasing punters at v e n u e s all over the country
after t h e release o f Midget Allah.
t h r o u g h t h e success o f Mulder and Scully a n d
Road Rage, last year s a w t h e rise a n d rise of a female-
fronted Welsh b a n d that w e n t bv t h e n a m e of Catato-
nia. The photo-ability of one Cerys Matthews might have
b e e n a factor but you can't argue with the fact that they
m a n a g e d to shift shed-loads o f units last year. Their n e w
a l b u m will appear in late M a y or early April. There's n o
title to it as yet. H o w about Regional Cotton? [drum fill]
After releasing their greatest hits under t h e n a m e
of Melting Pot, '98 s e e m e d to be a bit quiet for The Char-
latans. They should b e releasing a n a l b u m this year but
n o details are available as yet. This will b e their first
a l b u m without the sorely missed late keyboardist Rob
Collins. I'm e x p e c t i n g The Charlatans t o record a n
absolute belter o f a rock 'n'roll record this year. I h o p e
I'm right.
The private p s y c h e d e l i c brothers o f the d a n c e
scene are set t o let their long-player hit record s h o p s
across the nation around early s u m m e r t i m e . The C h e m -
ical Brothers' third a l b u m proper g o e s by the n a m e of
Under The Influence Of Love. Apparently N o e l Gal-
lagher, the godfather of popular rock, will make another
guest vocal to g o with his last effort. Setting Sun. Unfor-
tunately, Beth O r t o n will not b e able to contribute
because she's d o i n g her o w n a l b u m . [See above] Tsk!
Pop-stars today! They're so selfish! However, Jonathon
D o n a h u e , vocalist with current indie-faves M e r c u r y
Rev, will b e g r a b b i n g t h e m i c r o p h o n e for o n e o f the
tracks. Under The Influence Of Love looks set to be o n e
of t h e m o r e p r o m i s i n g releases o f 1999.
Talking o f collaborations, Death In Vegas have
m a n a g e d to drag in a f e w n a m e s off the street to guest
o n their latest offering t o the w o r l d , The Cantino Ses-
sions. There's Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie a n d age-
old warbler Iggy Pop. There's also others that they've
approached but they're not saying. Record contracts and
all that n o n s e n s e ! For the record, it s h o u l d be out in a
c o u p l e of m o n t h s .
There's n o real a l b u m n e w s o n n e w c o m e r s Gay
Dad. However, their debut single To Earth With Love has
b e e n p l e a s i n g t h e h e t e r o s e x u a l a n d h o m o s e x u a l
masses alike. I m e n t i o n t h e m only as a ' o n e to watch
out for this year.' Silly silly n a m e !
Felix A l b u m o f t h e Year winners, Gomez, will b e
bringing it o n for a s e c o n d time a b o u t halfway through
'99 with Cod's Big Spaceship (working title.) It'll be very
interesting to s e e what they c o m e up with. Their first
a l b u m w a s (partly) r e c o r d e d in Oily Peacock's garage
a n d that s o u n d e d innovatively quirky. G o d k n o w s what
they'll d o with a 24-track studio a n d s o m e highly paid
k n o w l e d g a b l e producer ready to cater t o their sonic
needs. This year c a n only s e c t h e m rise further. G o o d
luck to t h e boys f r o m llkley!
Still s q u a b b l i n g over t h e title o f the follow-up to
Drawn To The Deep End, Gene will release their next
a l b u m in February. Despite b e i n g proud o f Drawn To
The Deep End, Martin Rossiter is reported to have
b e e n a bit d i s a p p o i n t e d with it: 'We just took t o o long
m a k i n g it. So this o n e w e just sat d o w n a n d did it in a
month this o n e is a m o r e optimistic, younger album.'
James' Best Of. c o m p i l a t i o n b e c a m e o n e o f last
year's biggest sellers. This year, Tim Booth a n d the rest
should b e r e c o r d i n g a n e w a l b u m a n d releasing it
before t h e year is out.
M u c h m a l i g n e d b y t h e m u s i c press (probably
b e c a u s e o f Crispin's middle-class b a c k g r o u n d ) Kula
Shaker are back this year a n d will release their s e c o n d
a l b u m in M a r c h . It will b e p r e c e d e d by t h e single Mys-
tical Machine Gun at t h e e n d o f February. For t h e
a l b u m , they've got H o m o m G o w a s h w a r m i back to d o
s o m e m o r e vocals. H e d i d t h e b a c k i n g vocals for
Govinda, by t h e way. Expect t h e usual eclectic gubbins
a n d various mystic chants. They s e e m to be suffering
f r o m the s a m e disease as most artists in that they can't
decide o n a n a l b u m title. They have t h e w o r k i n g title
of Peasants, Pigs and Astronauts but it might not catch
on. H o w about K2? [drum fill]
Leftfield have taken their t i m e t o f o l l o w u p their
g r o u n d - b r e a k i n g a n d multi-unit s h i f t i n g Leftism. A
release date for t h e electro p e o p l e is set for April.
However, they've b e e n threatening to release this their
s e c o n d a l b u m for a l o n g time n o w . Let's h o p e w e get
s o m e creative stuff f r o m t h e m this year.
Indie favourites M o g w a i will b e releasing their sec-
o n d a l b u m in M a r c h . It has w h a t I think could be a solid
contender for A l b u m Title O f T h e Year: Come On, Die
Young. Hopefully, it'll live u p to t h e expectation o f t h e
title. Certain quarters o f t h e b a n d have described it as
a ' b e d r o o m M o g a d o n whitey gay disco funk o p e r a
s o u n d ' Easy to define, it is not. Interesting to listen to,
it probably will b e .
There will b e n e w material f r o m N e w O r d e r this
year o n c e p e o p l e have finished their side projects,
which include Electronic, M o n a c o a n d T h e Other Two.
There will also b e a b o x set o f singles b e i n g released.
That s h o u l d look nice o n m y shelf a l o n g s i d e m y M a s -
sive Attack a n d Nirvana singles box sets.
Last year, N o e l Gallagher said o n radio s o m e t h i n g
to t h e effect of, 'There will b e n o n e w Oasis material
until the year 2000.' Well, true to his w o r d , Oasis look
set to release a single in S e p t e m b e r with a n a l b u m
rapidly snapping at the heels o f it. H e also said that what
he d o e s write will be different f r o m a n y t h i n g that has
gone before. It's obviously this side o f his prediction that
he's concentrating o n !
M e n t i o n i n g a big o n e like Oasis, I feel duty b o u n d
to m e n t i o n a less large b a n d that are w o r t h y o f atten-
tion. O n e Lady O w n e r cut through t h e music scene with
their turbo charged a n d fully revved u p debut single,
Wheelkings 19/3. The next a n d current single, I Do
Need You, s h o w s a lighter side. It'll b e a crime if w e
don't get t o s e e a n a l b u m released f r o m this lot this
year.
Those orchestral trance-y types in Orbital are back
with s o m e n e w music after releasing a Greatest Hits
package at t h e back e n d o f last year. Paul Hartnoll has
said, 'We're calling it Middle Of Nowhere b e c a u s e it's
a hard place to b e . Everywhere is s o m e w h e r e , n o mat-
ter w h e r e you're standing a n d n o matter h o w hard y o u
try to get away f r o m things.' There will b e a single in
M a r c h a n d a tour to follow.
Over in t h e US, Pavement are g e a r i n g u p for t h e
release o f their latest offering in April. It's b e i n g pro-
d u c e d by Nigel Godrich, he of Radiohead fame. In fact,
Jonny G r e e n w o o d m a y even play o n it. Steven M a l k m u s
gave his view o n the a l b u m : 'The s o u n d of the a l b u m
so far is s o m e t h i n g we're calling Trip Metal but with the
usual Pavement vibe to it.' Look forward to s o m e exper-
imental stuff!
Rumours are a b o u n d that Primal Scream are record-
ing their next a l b u m , t h e follow u p to the critically
a c c l a i m e d Vanishing Point. N o t h i n g firm has b e e n
reported, just yet, t h o u g h .
The Propellerheads are also r u m o u r e d to b e fol-
lowing up Decksanddrumsandrockandroll later o n in the
year.
After h a n g i n g out in LA with p e o p l e like M o n e y
Mark a n d Ben Stiller, Reef have almost finished their fol-
low-up to Glow. The a l b u m has t h e w o r k i n g title Reef
On A Fresh Tip but is likely to c h a n g e . There s h o u l d b e
a single out f r o m it in February a n d then t h e a l b u m in
M a r c h . A n extensive tour is probably o n the cards as
they tend to tour like proverbial bastards.
After a while away f r o m t h e musical limelight The
Seahorses will return a n d release a n a l b u m in the s u m -
mer. It's either g o i n g to b e called Minus Blue or Motor-
cade. According to John Squire, the ratio o f songwriting
with respect to himself a n d Chris H c l m e is still roughly
the s a m e as it w a s before. Recording o f the a l b u m will
actually start this month although a lot of the songs have
b e e n tried a n d tested in front o f live audiences so con-
cert goers should recognise s o m e o f t h e m . Tracks so
far include Petroleum, Pi, Dolphins, Into The Light,
Pacific Blue a n d Tomb Raid.
The Stereophonies will release the follow-up t o
their debut Word Gets Around. Entitled Performance
and Cocktails, it promises to be a raucous rock a n d roll
affair. For t h e record, it hits t h e shelves at the start o f
M a r c h .
The Super Furry A n i m a l s will release their third
a l b u m proper early in t h e s u m m e r . Their collection o f
oddities, Outspaced, is in t h e shops n o w and has b e e n
received very well, critically a n d a m o n g s t the fans.
There s h o u l d be a single out in April to coincide with
the tour. They haven't m a n a g e d to decide o n a title yet
so I guess the 'Animals Don't Give A y o u get the
picture.
Feeling like they r u s h e d things a bit last time,
Supergrass d o not want to m a k e the s a m e mistake
again. They're taking all the time they n e e d t o m a k e
sure everything's h o w they w a n t it. The a l b u m k n o w n
as Cocked s h o u l d be ready for release in the s u m m e r .
C o n f i r m e d track titles are as follows: Out Of The Blue,
Pumping On the Stereo a n d What Went Wrong In Your
Head? D a n n y Goffey's c o m m i t m e n t s to Lodger will
obviously be taking a back scat this year as the 'Grass
will probably want to canvas t h e UK with a massive sell-
out tour.
fj
Brett A n d e r s o n a n d t h e boys have a n e w a l b u m
recorded a n d ready for release in February. In c o m -
parison to Coming Up, certain quarters o f the band have
described t h e s o u n d as 'not as poppy. It's probably
colder s o u n d i n g a n d a bit harder-edged. It's very var-
ied, m u c h m o r e than a n y t h i n g w e ' v e ever done.' The
S u e d e crew have t e a m e d u p with Steve O s b o r n e (Paul
O a k e n f o l d ' s remix partner) for t h e production. The
a l b u m looks set to b e a raw a n d Trash-y affair. Forgive
the p u n !
I ran Healy a n d t h e motley crew s h o u l d be kicking
off a n e w set o f tours in 1999. They've almost finished
their s e c o n d a l b u m w h i c h has t h e w o r k i n g title Final
Times but will not b e officially released under that
n a m e . Travis have o p t e d for M i k e H e d g e s a n d Nigel
G o d r i c h [ S e c Pavement] t o p r o d u c e . Set t o hit t h e
music s h o p s in M a y , a f e w tracks have c o n f i r m e d
titles: Why Does It Always Rain On Me? Flowers In Fhc
Window a n d As You Are. Hardly All I Wanna Do Is Rock,
is it?
W h e n you're scanning through the A-Z of Rock/Pop
in your H M V / O u r Price/Virgin you'll be pleased to k n o w
that in M a r c h w h e n y o u get near t h e e n d o f the aisle
Underworld will have a n e w record out. The reason that
they haven't really b e e n h a n g i n g round these parts
lately is that they w a n t e d to take s o m e time out and get
s o m e perspective after the Born Slippy explosion. Enti-
tled Beaucoup fish, it's likely to be a tighter a l b u m than
Second Toughest In The Infants.
Well that s e e m s t o b e your lot. I'm sure there's
plenty m o r e stuff out there. Keep your eyes o n Felix for
any n e w hotshots. If y o u w o u l d like to review music for
Felix, c o m e a l o n g to t h e m e e t i n g s at Felix o n Fridays.
Things usually kick o f f at a r o u n d one-thirty but it's best
to b e there a f e w m i n u t e s b e f o r e h a n d . I look forward
to s e e i n g t h e old faces a n d s o m e n e w ones. Thank y o u
for your time.
