College Behind Medical Union's Cash Chaos
By David Roberts
Close investigation o f t h e U n i o n
accounts has s h o w n that the £55 000
w h i c h has g o n e 'missing' f r o m the M e d
School reserves over the last six m o n t h s
was the result of a series o f C o l l e g e
accounting errors.
W h e n the IC S c h o o l o f M e d i c i n e
U n i o n (ICSMSU) a c c o u n t s w e r e c o n -
verted f r o m College to ICU control last
July, the reserve account w a s £55 000 in
credit. Without proper accounts to check
through for the previous year it w a s thus
a s s u m e d that this m o n e y w a s available,
and could be utilised for helping to estab-
lish the n e w ICSMSU, e q u i p their n e w
office and o v e r c o m e any t e e t h i n g prob-
lems w h i c h arose. H o w e v e r , as a result
of a series of large payments over the last
term this m o n e y has n o w d i s a p p e a r e d
completely, a n d the reserve account is
n o w effectively empty. This has led to
serious questions b e i n g a s k e d of M e d
School President W a d e G a y e d - a n d w a s
o n e of the contributory factors b e h i n d
the series of resignations that p l a g u e d
the ICSMSU Exec last term.
A fuller investigation of the accounts,
however, w o u l d s e e m to have cleared
Mr Gayed of any responsibility for vast
majority of this expenditure. Firstly, n o n e
of the clubs b a s e d at C h a r i n g Cross
received any f u n d s f r o m C o l l e g e last
year, tvery club ran up a debt, whilst all
the m o n e y w h i c h should have g o n e into
the club accounts e n d e d up in the M e d
School reserves. Consequently, ICSMSU
was forced to clear this debt - totaling £28
of writing the total cost cannot be ascer-
tained - although it is k n o w n to run to
several t h o u s a n d p o u n d s . Furthermore,
the m o n e y raised by last year's Charing
Cross rag was credited to the reserve
Wade Is enjoying his new-found 'stress free' existence
000 - at the start of the year, halving the
reserves over-night. Secondly, a series of
unpaid bills have c o m e to light, many left
over f r o m the period w h e n ICSMSU ran
the Charing Cross bar. Invoices continue
to arrive for beer, staffing and bar equip-
m e n t (including a £1500 cash register
a n d a £700 ice machine) a n d at the time
account, rather than given to the chari-
ties c o n c e r n e d , a n d the £2317 'profit'
f r o m the bar at last year's Charing Cross
S u m m e r Ball had to be returned to two
of the organisers w h o lost several t h o u -
sand p o u n d s o n the event.
O n c e all of these items have b e e n
a c c o u n t e d for, a p p r o x i m a t e l y £9000
remains, o f w h i c h £6000 was spent on
c o m p u t e r s a n d e q u i p m e n t for the n e w
office in the B M S b u i l d i n g . The final
£3300 w a s lost w h e n the p l a n n e d Grad-
uation Ball was cancelled only a f e w days
before it w a s d u e to take place - a n d is
thus the only part of the initial £55 000
w h i c h has actually b e e n 'lost'.
