Star Trek: insurrection * * * *
Starring: Patrick Stewart, Johnathan Frakes, Brent Spiner, Michael Dorn, Levar Burton, Marina Sirtis
Director: Johnathan Frakes
T
he eternal p r o b l e m that f a c e s
every TV to film transition is h o w to
m a k e your m o v i e a p p e a l t o both
avid fans a n d n e w c o m e r s alike. T o o
m u c h required k n o w l e d g e (of charac-
ters or previous events) will alienate t h e
massess, whilst starting f r o m scratch will
result in death threats f r o m obsessive
fans. A n d t h e ultimate e x a m p l e o f this
d i c h o t o m y lies in every n e w Star Trek
movie.
As a result. Insurrection avoids a n y
required k n o w l e d g e o f previous plot-
lines (unlike its predecessor. First Contact)
a n d instead throws t h e intrepid Enter-
prise crew upgainst a n e w e n e m y , t h e
Son'a, o n a n e w w o r l d p o p u l a t e d by t h e
p e a c e f u l Bak'u (as ever, all Star Trek
n a m e s have that faint air o f stupidity
about them). Consequently, all y o u really
n e e d to k n o w is that there's a b u n c h o f
m e n a n d w o m e n , w h o fly a r o u n d t h e
galaxy in a spaceship called t h e Enter-
prise, d o i n g g o o d a n d b e i n g brave. A n d
surely everyone in t h e W e s t e r n w o r l d
knows that?
Insurrection is also a lot lighter in
tone than First Contact, thanks to a lot o f
tongue-in-cheek playing f r o m t h e cast
( i n c l u d i n g o n e great s e q u e n c e w h e n
Picard rescues Data by singing Gilbert &
Sullivan). There's e v e n a f e w romantic
c n t a g l c m c n t s this t i m e a r o u n d , with
Picard falling for o n e o f t h e (seemingly
helpless) Bak'u.
What results is thus a g o o d old fash-
ioned piece o f Star Trek, b l e n d i n g action,
adventure, r o m a n c e a n d pure fun, care-
fully controlled by actor/director trakes,
w h o s e e m s to have a great sense o f
w h i c h buttons to push. Thus, just w h e n
the story s e e m s to b e b e c o m m i n g just a
little t o o sentimental, he t h o w s in a gag,
a n d w h e n y o u b e g i n t o worry that t h e
the situation isn't b e i n g taken seriously
e n o u g h , a l o n g c o m e s a perfectly chore-
o g r a p h e d action s c e n c e (and s o m e very
nice effects) t o put y o u back o n t h e
e d g e o f your seat.
Indeed, t h e plot itself screams Star
Trekal every turn. What other sci-fi adven-
ture w o u l d s e e ou r heros battling their
o w n top-brass a n d a h i d e o u s race o f
dying aliens, to protect a planet w h i c h
holds t h e key t o eternal youth? M o r e
importantly, w h o else w o u l d m a n a g e to
pull-off s u c h a tale with a n y credence o f
believability? But o f course, in t h e Star
Trek u n i v e r s e , that just represents
another d a y at t h e office for t h e crew o f
the Enterprise.
As long as you're prepared to accept
the cheesy p h i l o s o p h y a n d moralising
that g o e s hand-in-hand with G e n e
Rodenberry's creation then you're almost
certain to enjoy Insurrection. First Contact
it certainly isn't, a n d if you're l o o k i n g for
a similar gritty, effects laden actioner
t h e n l o o k e l s e w h e r e - Insurrection
c h o o s e s t o m i x a d e c e n t plot, a f e w
j o k e s a n d a very sixties live-and-let-live
attitude in with t h e all-important action.
Roll o n Star Trek 10. â€¢

Enemy of the State * * * *
Starring : Will Smith, Gene Hackman, Jon Voight, Jason Robards, Jamie Kennedy, Tom Sizemore
Director: Tony Scott
Satellite surveillance. Cool. Pretty useless when Its cloudy though.
n the last f e w years, t h e n u m b e r o f
g e n u i n e , sure-fire hit m o v i e s h a s
slowly d w i n d l e d away. Just b e c a u s e
your movie has massive a m o u n t s o f
computer generated effects, stars Arnie
or has a gargantuan b u d g e t , y o u c a n
no-longer b e g u a r a n t e e d t o turn a hefty
profit. O n c e in a while, however, a
movie will still appear that h a s " b o x
office g o l d " written all over it - a n d
Enemy of the State is a p r i m e e x a m p l e .
Put together Will Smith, t h e star o f t h e
biggest m o v i e s f r o m ' 9 6 a n d '97
(Independence Day a n d Men in Black),
a n d Jerry Bruckheimer, t h e most lucra-
tive producer o f all t i m e (Con Air, The
Rock, Armageddon, Crimson Tide, Top
Gun....) a n d massive a u d i e n c e s will
undoubtedly c o m e your way.
This t i m e a r o u n d , however, Bruck-
heimer has put away his pyrotechnics
and Smith has left his t r a d e m a r k c o m i c
expressions and timing at h o m e . Instead,
Enemy of the State is a high-class, h i g h -
tech thriller, in t h e style o f seventies c o n -
spiracy classics All the Presidents Men,
The Parallax View a n d The Conversation.
M o v i n g those paranoia-laden classics
into t h e nineties, Smith is a lawyer w h o
is targeted by N S A top-brass (Voight)
after unwittingly c o m i n g into possession
of a n incriminating videotape. C u e a pro-
cession o f a m a z i n g l y high-tech b u g g i n g
e q u i p m e n t a n d e v e n satellite surveil-
lance, as V o i g h t a t t e m p t s t o d e s t r o y
Smith's reputation. All s e e m s lost until
help arrives in the s h a p e o f former N S A
m a n Hackman...
In effect, rather than the standard
series o f massive set-pieces, Enemy of
the State is o n e l o n g chase, w h o s e pace
never flags thanks to fast edits a n d s o m e
neat c a m e r a effects. M o r e o v e r , it's a
chase that's more cerebral than explosive
- with Smith a n d H a c k m a n constantly
forced t o think their w a y a r o u n d prob-
lems (after all, y o u c a n hardly take o n the
entire N S A in a g u n fight). This, o f course,
puts a lot m o r e pressure than normal o n
Will Smith's acting talents, yet h e c o m e s
a w a y a bigger star than before, avoiding
his usual charm a n d h u m o u r in favour of
a perfectly b a l a n c e d rendition o f a m a n
w h o s e life is dissolving around h i m . Plus,
there are very f e w p e o p l e in H o l l y w o o d
w h o c a n l o o k c o o l r u n n i n g t h r o u g h
W a s h i n g t o n in rush-hour, w e a r i n g noth-
ing but a dressing g o w n a n d a pair o f
boxers.
If you're prepared t o accept t h e X-
files/Oliver Stone conspiracy theory view
of t h e w o r l d , a n d join in with t h e para-
noia, then you'll find Enemy of the State
is t h e kind o f superior action blockbuster
that w e ' v e all b e e n l o o k i n g for. Q
