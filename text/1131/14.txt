This is a highly symbollic film about

inevitably run against the m o d e r n trend.
Beyond this clever a n d interesting

gradual emancipation of the girls and the
subsequent acceptance o f this n e w sit-

The characters are i m m e d i a t e - u p o n

are colourful, even artistic (but always
believable as a part of everyday life) - yet
the director is only c i g h t e e e n years old.

O n e o f the most eagerly awaited films o f
the year (if you don't count Star Wars) has
to b e G u s V a n Sant's c o p y o f t h e Hitch-
cock classic Psycho. Critically lambasted
well in advance o f its release, V a n Sant
has m a d e t h e bizzare decision to repro-
duce the bleak 1960 thriller shot for shot.
In other words, almost every s c e n e will
look a n d feel exactly t h e s a m e - except
for the addition o f colour a n d , o f course,
an all star cast, featuring Vince V a u g h n ,
A n n e H e c h e a n d Julianne M o o r e .
So, will it work? At present, w h o

LA Confidential
Universally acclaimed as o n e of the best
films o f t h e d e c a d e , LA Confidential is
perhaps the most perfectly m a d e film
noir o f the last forty years.
It's a dark, t o u g h thriller, that tells
the "real" story o f 50's boom-town LA,
w h e r e the gangsters buy t h e DA over
drinks, a n d every other c o p is o n t h e
take. Its a time w h e n celebrity c o p s like
Kevin Spaccy can m a k e a fortune, whilst
good-guys like G u y Pearce a r e used
a n d a b u s e d by all a r o u n d t h e m . But,
w h e n events conspire t o bring these
two together, alongside vicious cop Rus-
sell C r o w e , n o t h i n g c a n prevent t h e m
from finding out t h e truth - no matter
w h a t t h e cost.
Cop Land
After d o z e n s o f false starts, Sylvester
Stallone finally proves to t h e world that
he really c a n act - a n d with Hollywood
legends Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta, Robert
De Niro o n screen alongside him, that's
n o m e a n feat.
Cop Land is another broody, hard-
n o s e d thriller, based in a world of cor-
rupt cops a n d high-powered cover ups.
Sly is the sheriff o f a small N e w Jersey
t o w n that m a n y NYPD officers call
h o m e , but his weak-willed nature means
that h e simply looks after t h e menial
police tasks, w h i l e t h e residents break
the law as they s e e fit. However, t h e
arrival o f d e Niro, investigating t h e
cover-up o f a suspicious death, results
in Stallone's decision to find out t h e
truth for himself.
The Jackal
R e m a k i n g The Day of the Jackal with
Bruce Willis a n d Richard Gere probably
s e e m e d like a really g o o d idea at the
time, but thanks to a strange re-working
of the plot, which eschews acting, direct-
ing a n d even morality in favour of explo-
sions a n d hilariously crap disguises.
Willis is t h e e p o n y m o u s Jackal, a n
assassin that no-one c a n identify w h o
has b e e n e m p l o y e d to kill a high-rank-
ing m e m b e r o f t h e US g o v e r n m e n t .
Richard Gere is the convicted IRA ter-
rorist w h o promises t o help track h i m
d o w n , in return for his f r e e d o m , f r o m
there o n , the predictability meter goes
off the scale. •
