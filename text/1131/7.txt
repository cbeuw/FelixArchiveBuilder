Thought for the Day
Absent Friends
I can categorically state, deep from the
I vaults of my not inconsiderable per-
sonal experience, that the Christmas
term always goes badly. I once read
somewhere (and do you know, I think it
was in Felix) that Siberians frequently
suffer depression brought on by... dark-
ness. Once those clocks go back, there's
no escape; we are condemned to spend
months attempting to thrive on eight
hours of daylight, paling and decaying
like etiolated plants. When it gets dark,
people get anxious, lonely and down-
right fed up; and when people get fed
up, people split up. It's almost like the 'flu
going round.
Despite having been single since...
bear with me (rustle of paper) - ah yes;
February 1772,1 was still affected by this
Christmas madness. The only reason I
managed to get out of bed at all in the
last few weeks of term was to make the
longest obscenity I could out of the
Countdown letters games. I didn't even
need to get up to watch the cricket: hot
chocolate, nice warm bed, Radio Four.
It also seems that I was not the only
one who was far from rel-
ishing going back home
for Christmas. A propor-
tion of freshers are no doubt wondering
who took all their interesting school-
friends away and replaced them with a
bunch of selfish, immature. Northern
degenerates. (Hey, don't worry. I'm sure
they all feel the same way about you.) A
self-indulgent orgy of complaints cas-
caded against my poor, influenza-
stretched eardrums: "I don't want to go
home for Christmas. I'll have to sit and
laugh at Aunt Hattie's jokes, and all the
time I'll be dying for a reefer." Hmm.
Scrooge never thought of that one.
I bit the bullet eventually, of course,
as did everyone else, as the population
of IC disgorged itself all over the UK, and
beyond. Things were no better on the
motorway; the middle lane, as usual,
was full of idiots doing sixty. Sixty? In the
middle lane? Sitting in the back seat, it
was hard to express my disgust without
resorting to colourful language. These
people possess cars with 1.2 litre
engines, listen to Tina Turner, like their
steaks done medium.
All Campbell drink shandy and, a
decade ago, would doubt-
less have been voting SDP.
Despite the black ice, gale force
winds and poor lane selection, I got back
to Liverpool eventually. Chip shops were
40% cheaper, and didn't serve soggy
chips; haircuts cost Â£3.70; the 86 bus still
went the same way as it always has,
costing a measly 60p for students, and
the beer was seriously cheap.
It's Christmas Eve. While it's likely to
be freezing in metrocentric London, I've
come to the pub in just a t-shirt. It's 9:30
p.m.. and the place is simply packed
with people I used to know. Well, that's
not exactly true, but I'm hoping someone
might turn up later. And turn up they do.
In no particular order: some drunken
lads (mates from times long gone); three
girls from school who utterly failed to
recognise me for ages; the guy I used to
sit next to in English, who once again had
me giggling nervously behind my text-
book (actually, it was a pint), somebody's
once-sweet little brother who is now 18,
has a skinhead, and smokes like a bas-
tard; and three of my best friends from
halcyon days, one of whom is now at IC.
(All right, Dave?!) And suddenly, it hits
me: this is what it's all about. My Christ-
mas shopping is done, tomorrow is
Christmas Day; and I'm back in the local
with the best of friends. The everyday
tribulations of dirty, polluted London are
irrelevant. There's a bunch of people
playing on a giant Connect Four board,
and frankly, I can't contain a giant sigh
of relief.
(Enter moral of story, stage left,
clutching stomach.) It's not surprising
everyone's a bit disgruntled at this time
of year; life gets so boring if you let it.
London alone contains six million odd
inhabitants; how many of them do you
know? There's a whole world out there;
opportunities, experiences, people to be
met. Don't come complaining to me if
you spent the whole year stuck in your
bedroom.
Television Renaissance
What's going on at
STOIC?
STOIC is the ICU television society, and
we are based in a Studio Complex on the
top floor of the Union Building. We
have everything here to produce live
and edited television programmes. Catch
us in the JCR and around the Union Build-
ing.
^ Schedule ^
Tuesday
I C y o u
The show all about ICU's many clubs
and societies.
Thursday
STOIC live
Our eclectic, lively magazine pro-
gramme, where we show you all the
stuff we couldn't fit in anywhere else.
Friday
Something for the weekend
All that's happening in London this
weekend. Nightbus not included.
Over the holidays
we have gutted the
place, integrating the
latest in digital editing
and mixing technology.
Shuffling everything
around has also given
us much more space
to sit about and talk -
occasionally even
about programmes.
Last term was the
first time in two years
that STOIC produced
regular programming,
broadcasting two lively
shows each week. Building up the
schedule after such a lengthy period of
inactivity has not been easy, but our
shows are now quite good - even if we
do say so ourselves. This term we intend
to produce three live programmes a
week and supplement our output with
short, recorded films. When we're not
showing live or recorded programmes
there will be our continuous text ser-
vice, letting you know what's happening
around college.
In the past significant effort was
needed to maintain professional video
equipment and an eager team of boffins
stoic
worked round the clock
to keep STOIC up and
running. This effort is
no longer required, with
reliable equipment
available at high street
prices.
This year we have
re-aligned STOIC, with
less emphasis on tech-
nical wizardry, and
more opportunities to
learn how to make TV.
Opportunities for peo-
ple like you. We
promise not to baffle
you with cries of XLR's, redheads and
Umats - instead we'll help you to make
great television which, secretly, haven't
we all wanted to do? Don't let all the
stairs put you off, there is a lift, so why
not pop by at lunchtime or on a Wednes-
day afternoon. Or drop us an email, our
address is below.

What can STOIC do for
your club or society?
There's a whole heap of stuff that STOIC
can do to help publicise ICU societies.
We'll be in touch with societies soon to
explain in more detail (via the pigeon
holes in the resource centre).
If you let us know about upcoming
events, we can advertise them on our
text service. This is a really easy way to get
your message to people around college,
without any photocopying and blutac.
This term we are producing a series
about clubs and societies, we want to
provide all clubs with the chance to
explain what's going on and what they've
got coming up. Also if you are holding a
special event, you can talk to us on our
magazine show - STOIC live. Alterna-
tively, we will help you to produce a
short video about your club.
If you are organising a big event,
STOIC can film it and duplicate tapes for
sale. We normally only charge for the
tapes, subject to agreement of a mini-
mum tape order. If there is anything that
we can do for you, please do get in
touch.
