Friday 28 September 2007 felix
had to face the blizzard out-
side. After dusting snow off our
bags we stepped up the pace and
stomped it down, making record
time to reach the planned night’s
refuge in Montroc, where the
others caught up with us.
Sadly Day 12 offered more bad
weather, and so the ridge walk was
abandoned in favour of a
valley walk to Chamonix
and a cable car upwards.
The gondola and cable
car combo ascended us
into cloud to Le Brévent
at 2525m. Fresh snow was
falling and five inches lay
on the ground; the group
photograph looks more
like a winter tour! Af-
ter snowball fights we
gingerly picked our
way to the Refuge
Bellachat (2150m).
The view from it was
magical with the clearing cloud.
The final day began encounter-
ing an ibex at close quarters on
the trail. It was an incredible sight
to see such a large wild mammal
fearless of us. On continuing, we
descended into lower-lying cloud
and the group briefly split, re-
meeting further down to all stroll
together to the campsite we’d left
13 days before. Now it was time
to celebrate! After some beers we
ate like kings in a local restaurant.
Over dinner it transpired that
Chris, the black spot game’s insti-
gator, was the one with the spot
left in his bag. His forfeit was our
entertainment: a streak through
the village in Anna’s hot pants
and bikini whilst chanting pro-
environmental slogans.
Completing such a circular
route evoked a mixture of emo-
tions – elation of completion
that the entire snow and glacier-
covered massif has been circum-
navigated, but also that after such
Peuty, and sold
out to €10 dry
beds. There was
one remedy for
our cold and
damp state: we
ate custard!
Rain, high winds,
snow on the passes and
low cloud tempted
us to seek
alternative trans-
port for day 11.
We decided
to walk,
but some
turned
back and
took trans-
port. Oncethe
remaining seven of
us got into our stride the
rain turned to snow and then
to hail. We made it to the ref-
uge at the Col de Balme (2191m)
(Franco-Swiss border) and quick-
ly scrambled inside; it was warm,
cosy and smelled of tasty vegeta-
ble soup. Unfortunately all
good things come to
an end and we
a long trip we were still in the
same place!
Over the fortnight we’d
crossed ten mountain passes,
four of those standing at over
2500m, covered 164km of
tough terrain, accumulated a
height gain of around 8,800m
and loss of 10,250m, and all
carrying not inconsiderable
rucksacks – some over 20kg.
We encountered weather ex-
tremes of 30°C sunshine and
blizzards to deal with, as well
as significant snow fields to
cross. Several high-level bal-
cony paths provided feelings of
being on top of the world, and
for me, although it is difficult
to choose, the high level vari-
ant route we took on Day 6 was
a real highlight – spending the
entire day above 2000m, and
enjoying panoramic views on
top of two summits.
Memories such as this one
(and all the rest) will last a
lifetime.
