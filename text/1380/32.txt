Eccentric English Style
L
ondon is the new New
York, apparently. Let that
thought comfort you as
you hand over the cash
for a £6 sandwich. Al-
though there are many
things about London that suck; ex-
pensive food, tourists swarming the
pavements, the tube. At least London’s
got style. Well, not the chavs walking
around the outskirts of London. But in
the pretentious arty parts; East Lon-
don & Soho.
Agyness Deyn is the clichéd example
of edgy london style. Clichéd but still
ridicuously in fashion. Steal some of
her style by wearing a colourful hoodie
under a leather jacket. Completing
this look are skinny jeans, which are
still in! Anyone who says otherwise is
som=eone too fat or old too wear them
who’s just wish fulfilling. But black

skinnies are tired, and the new thing is
a pair of classic blue skinnies. Worn ex-
quisitely by skinny indie/emo/nu-rave/

your legs.
A great look for going out is either
colouredtightswithpatentblackshoes,
or opaque black tights with fluorescent
shoes. Opaque coloured tights are bet-
ter than sheer, which can give the illu-
sion of being some sort of alien-human
hybrid.
In make-up think simple pops of
colour. Bright lipstick is hot, especially
John Saunder’s new collection for 17,
which includes hot pink and fluores-
cent red.
The No. 1 trend which will pop up
in seasons to come is flashes of super-
bright colour!
