who is Russian,
Scotty who is Scot-
tish, and Sulu who is
Chinese, but no Ira-
nians. My son is very
upset and doesn’t
understand why there aren’t any Iranians on
Star Trek.”
President Bush laughed, leaned toward the
Iranian ambassador, and whispered back,
“It’s because it takes place in the future.”
Scorpio
This week you
vomit after kissing
a girl at the Mingle.
Your vomit begins
to consume you
and the projectile
liquid consisting of beer and various other
booze becomes a capsule for you to fly around
the room in. Suddenly your life turns into
a reconstruction of the film “Flight Of The
Navigator”. How fucking cool is that?
Libra
I sense its your
birthday, but people
will forget that fact
because its England
vs Tonga and its
crucial because if
we don’t win, we go out. Afterwards we’ll go
to another birthday anyway, even though her
birthday was yesterday! You know who you
are, still you’re 21 so its more cause to celebrate
than being 23.
Sagittarius
Moving house is
nevereasy,especially
when you’ve moved
into a new place 3
weeks ago and now
have to move to one
of the most dull and boring places on Earth. Its
just stupid, all those bloody grid systems and
sod all busses or useful pavements, why would
you purposefully create such a city. You know
the city I’m talking about.
Capricorn
Hmm... I’m sat
here, at 5:38 am on
Wednesday night
and I’m wondering
whether I should
play the “Ooo...
Look at what this horoscope picture looks
like” Horoscope. Is it too soon? Will I be
dropping another clanger like that time I asked
your mum if she preferred one or two in the
stink?t Tune in next week to find out.
Cancer
WHAT THE
FUCK IS THAT
GUY SMOKING?!
This is strictly an
english language
only zone. Some of
the shapes in those weird alphabets look like
freshly defecated Alphabetti Spaghetti after
I’ve washed it down with a tall glass of extra-
flaming vindaloo sauce, followed by a Flaming
Lesbino. This does not amuse me.

Ако разумете ову
реченицу, онда ви
сте из Србије!
Si vous pouvez
lire ceci, vous êtes
français !
Wenn Sie dies lesen können, sind Sie deutsch!
Se lei può leggere questo, lei è italiano!
Si usted puede leer esto, usted es español!
If you can’t understand any of these, then you’re
dull!

The Iranian
Ambassador to the
United Nations had
just finished giving a
speech, and walked
out into the lobby
where he met President Bush. They shook
hands, and as they walked the Iranian said,
“You know, I have just one question about
what I have seen in America. My son watches
this show ‘Star Trek’ and in it there is Chekhov
Taurus
The recent weight
you’ve put on is
nothing to worry
about, 95 kg is a
standard weight for
elite sports players.
Although how the extra 3 kg got there from
last week is baffling! Just take solace in the fact
that there are people that are a lot heavier than
you, the majority of which can be found across
the Atlantic.
Aries
This week your
brand spanking new
Arts Editors start
work on their first
issue. This week
your brand spank-
ing new Arts Editors’ work gets deleted, on
their first day in the office. This week you offer
yourself on a platter for a royal brand spanking
because you deserve it for making some many
people’s lives a living misery.
Pisces
Getting coffee for
people all day is
not something to
be embarrassed
about, someone’s
got to do it. The fact
that there might be people younger than you
working in the office is the worrying thing.
At least you’re getting some experience and
maybe even a career for the future. Mine’s a
grande mocha when you’re ready!

Before all you
fucking pedants
start getting in a
hissy fit because
of the slight error
Mike Cook made
last week in the Freshers’ Special Issue,
take a minute to breathe. So what if he got
Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy mixed up. Shit
happens. Let’s just sweep this one under
the carpet and ignore the gigantic bulge.
Slitherlink 1 – Normal
Answers for Slitherlink 1*
How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar
to Minesweeper mixed with a dash of
Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw
lines between the dots to create one
long, and most importantly, looping
line. It should have no start or finish;
just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many
lines should be drawn around it, for
example:
Cells which don’t contain a number
can be surrounded by any number of
lines.
Remember, the line must form a
loop, so the line cannot branch. The
following situations are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There
are never cells containing the number
4 in Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most
common place to start on a Slitherlink
grid is by drawing crosses around any
zeros. Drawing crosses is purely done
to so that you know where there can’t
possibly be a line. So, take the pattern
below as an example. Begin by drawing
crosses, then by filling in some lines:
Now the lines can only continue in the
following directions:
The Slitherlinks on this page are basic
5x5 grids. Get practising because you
can expect some 10x10s later in the
term and perhaps even some severe
25x30 grids when we’re feeling really
mean. Email us to let us know how you
got on with these ones.
If you’re wondering how there can
possibly already been an answer to a
Slitherlink, it’s because Slitherlink 1*
was in the Freshers’ Issue. So, ner.
