Just like the best of the BBC’s pro-

something straight from the archives.
That’s right, until we can find ourselves
a crossword setter you’re going to be
able to relive those halcyon days from
yesterday with a crossword from 2002.
This one is courtesy of a grid setting
legend known simply as Boris the In-
quisitive Goat. We hope you enjoy it.

Sports league
So the start of the New Year beckons,
another year full of wild nights out get-
ting pissed, take away food, promiscu-
ous sex (ok maybe not in Gimperial)
and some studying for good measure.
Sounds good right? Wrong, because
while you may look like top dog now,
years from now it isn’t a 6 pac you’re
going to see in the mirror, rather a keg!
Overweight and unfit you can always
convince yourself that you need fat to
convert into muscle.
Alternatively you’re the 55kg guy
who, despite the complete lack of mus-
cle bulk and definition, remains confi-
dent in pulling off a wife beater in col-
lege... I admire your confidence, now
put a jacket on.
Truth is, no matter who you are, exer-
cise and fitness should be an important
part of your life. If competitive sports
are not for you, and you don’t want to
be tied down to non flexible sessions
run by the various societies then you
should be heading down to that place
called Ethos. If you don’t know where
it is by now don’t carry on reading this
article.
So bin the excuses for this year be-
cause we have all heard them before.
Ladies, don’t tell me you don’t want to
go to the gym because you hate peo-
ple looking at you, because the only
person I want to look at is myself. And
fellas don’t be scared of looking like a
sissy because you can only pump 6kg
weights, because we all were there
once. We all want to get fitter, lose
some weight or even put some on, but
often too apathetic to take the next
step. Write down your goals for your
body today! Identify your ideal body
and work towards it, because at the
end of the day it’s all on you. Yes, your
partner may say that they love you just
the way you are, but it doesn’t stop you
from wanting to be something better!
It’s all on you and that is the beauty
of working out; your time, your place,
your rules. But if you’re feeling a little
lost don’t be scared of asking for help.
Email me and I can address the week’s
popular topics.
Just starting off at the gym? Try this
balanced workout to help you build
muscle and improve overall strength,
getting you ready for more advance
workout later on. Best performed 2
times a week for 4 weeks along with
other workout days. Aim to work out
3 times a week at least, and never the
same muscles twice in two days.
Every work out should consist of a
5 min warm up on the treadmill fol-
lowed by at least 1 warm up set of your
first exercise. If you looking to get ‘big’
work for the burn, the burn which lets
you know you’re really working. If you
wake up stiff tomorrow and it isn’t be-
cause of that porno you saw last night,
then pat yourself on the back because
you’re well on your way to upgrading
yourself.
I shouldn’t need to explain the squats
or bench press; because lets face it we
should all know what they are.
Romanian deadlifts, as exotic as
they sound are a simply a variation of
the bodybuilders favourite exercise,
the deadlift. This exercise targets glu-
tes and hamstrings, but acts as an all
around body workout.
Stand erect holding the barbell just
outside your hips with your feet hip
width apart. Using an overhand grip
lean forward by pushing your hips
backwards as the bar slides down your
to mid shin level and your upper body
approaches parallel to the floor. Re-
verse the action by pushing your hips
forward as you exhale at the top.
The final exercise will give your arms
an amazing pump… a sign of things
to come if you keep at it! Using the
cable machine with a bar attachment
perform sets of 8 reps of the bicep
curls. Once you complete that move
straight into rope pulldowns, focusing
on spreading your arms apart in the fi-
nal half of the movement. The final set
should be completed to failure… i.e.
when you physically cannot perform
the exercise.
Enjoy the work out, revel in the burn,
and soon you’ll be reaping the reward
in the mirror.

Felix takes no responsibility if you
break yourself in half whilst trying
to lift weights that are clearly too
heavy for you. Man up!

This year, Felix Sport is going to run a
league table for all the sports team at
Imperial. It will hopefully encourage
a bit of friendly rivalry between the
teams and the clubs, and at the end
of the year, an overall champion will
be declared. Below is the league table
where all of the teams competing in
BUSA competitions are included, so
if you want your scores to be counted,
please make sure you send you results
in to BUSA.
The ranking of the teams is based on
the Felix Index (FI), which is calculated
as follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) - (L*3).
Only teams with 5 games or more will
be considered in the overall champion-
ship at the end of year. Good luck!
