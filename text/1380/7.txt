Introducing the CGCU
T
his year the CGCU will
be coming back. It’s a
true revival, and it has al-
ready started before term
has even begun. We’ve
spent the summer organising amazing
events, busting a gut to get sponsor-
ship for them, and worrying the other
faculty unions.
Events
Coming up in only a couple of weeks
is the first Engineers’ Bar Night of the
year, with free beer for engineers for
as long as it lasts! It’ll be from 6pm in
the Union Bar (on the East side of the
Union) and there will be ale and lager
for all.
On Saturday 27th October will be the
CGCU Centennial Celebration Dinner.
In the marquee on Queen’s Lawn, with
a three course meal, drinks and coffee
included in the ticket price, as well as
a late night bar, music and dancing,
it’ll be a blowout party and not just for
freshers.
Tickets prices are only £25 for engi-
neers (£30 for everyone else) and we’ve
subsidised it heavily for a really great
night. Professor Mike Kelly (Chief Sci-
entific Advisor to the government) will
be our guest speaker. At the moment,
tickets are by email from dinner@cgcu.
net or at our office on Level 3 Mechani-
cal Engineering. Soon we’ll have stands
up around college so you can buy them
during lunch.
Freshers
I should say the trwaditional welcome
to freshers, and congratulations on
choosing the best technical college
in the UK. You should pretty early on
get their City and Guilds Wristbands.
These aren’t just freebies to let you
know what union you’re in; they’re
going to be tickets to special fresh-
ers events like bar nights and cinema
nights all through the year. Keep them!
Wear them with pride and let those
around you know that you’re an Engi-
neer. Remember, it’s the largest faculty,
with the longest hours – but we get the
best results!
Mascots
They said mascotry was dead, but we
at City and Guilds know that it was
just sleeping. We’ve been busy annoy-
ing the other faculty unions over the
summer by nabbing their mascots, as
you’ll see from the news pages. As well
as our very own Spanner and Bolt, we
are currently in possession of Davey
the Davy Lamp (RSM) and two out of
four parts of Theta the Thermometer
(RSCU). We’re working on the other
half of Theta but it might take a while.
Combined ransom money (if they
manage to pay up) will raise up to £600
for RAG charities.
Elections
Soon we will be opening nominations
for our unfilled positions. If you feel
like standing for your Departmental
society’s position, or would like to be
Honorary Secretary, RAG co-ordina-
tor, or any other of the positions avail-
able on CGCU exec, please contact me
at president@cgcu.net. Whether or
not you want to stand, you should have
a vote when the time comes! Keep your
eyes out for posters and other informa-
tion sources.
Our plans don’t end here. We’ve man-
aged to accrue enough money to put
on some stunning events for the rest
of the year, but we just haven’t decided
what yet! A lot of our annual events
are going to be bigger and better than
before – for instance, the Egg Race, a
small event for the last few years, is go-
ing to have some exciting prizes and be
on a larger scale than it has been for a
decade – it should be a real engineer-
ing challenge.
