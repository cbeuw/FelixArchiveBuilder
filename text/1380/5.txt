Union hands over control of
its finance to College
The Union relinquished control of its
finances in exchange for £3.2million
of funding. The money gained will
be used to pay for the next phase of
the Beit Masterplan which is seeing a
number of redevelopments in the Un-
ion building being made.
Unfortunately, the deal made be-
tween the two parties has stalled be-
cause the College is unhappy with the
current situation the Union’s finance
systems. The second phase of Beit’s
redevelopment will not happen until
2008 now. Head to the News section
for more information.
Centenary Ball success
“Hella mash-up” was yelled louder
than ever before at the 2007 Summer
Ball. Tied in with the Centenary cele-
brations, the Summer Ball was the Un-
ion’s most successful ever and it even
made a profit.
Regular tickets for the Summer Ball
had sold out with a month to go until
the event itself leaving the remaining
Ents tickets to be snapped up. Some
tickets even popped up on eBay.
Events at the Ball included the usual
mix of sets from T4/Radio1 presenters,
bumper cars, a human table football
game and a merry-go-round the Rec-
tor couldn’t resist a ride on.
Sykes’ Successor
The next Rector of Imperial College
London will be Sir Roy Anderson. He
will take over from Sir Richard Sykes in
the summer of 2008 as the 14th Rector
at Imperial.
Currently, Sir Roy works for the Min-
istry of Defence but he has long term
associations with the College. During
the 60s he studied at Imperial obtain-
ing a first class degree in zoology.
He went on to gain his PhD and then
further down the line to become head
of Imperial’s Biology Department.
Presently, he is involved with Impe-
rial as the Chair in Infectious Disease
Epidemiology.
Smoking ban
On 1st July 2007 the smoking ban came
into effect. College set out its policy on
smoking across campus. Beyond the
restrictions imposed by law, College is
not permitting smoking on major pe-
destrian routes such as the Sherfield
Walkway and Dalby Court.
Most freshers hoping to have a ciga-
rette will have to step outside into the
street as College have ruled that nearly
all halls rooms are smoke-free loca-
tions. Exceptions to the rule are single
bedrooms in Fisher Hall, Pembridge
Gardens and Wilson House.
Wye students disgruntled at
degree results
A number of final year students study-
ing at Wye felt that they hadn’t received
the degree results they deserved. At
the time of the initial uproar, it was be-
lieved that only 10% of students were
awarded a first or 2.1 degree. This per-
centage was far lower than the equiva-
lent for previous graduates.
However, in September an investiga-
tion was conducted into the apparent
drop in degree grades after allegations
were made on the Live! website by the
2007 graduates. The investigation de-
termined that the original 10% figure
was incorrect and that approximately
26% of final year students achieved a
first or 2.1 degree. The results for the
2007 graduates were in line with previ-
ous years.
For the full tale including a mam-
moth comments thread and, of course,
Facebook, head to Live! at www.live.

Hall prices increase
College increased the cost of halls ac-
commodation by just under 5%. This
increase was above the rate of inflation.
Students staying in halls of residence
will also have to fork out cash if they
want to wash their clothes because
College has introduced coin operated
washing machines.
Not surprisingly, newly built South-
side houses the most expensive rooms
where an en-suite single will set you
back a cool £155.61 per week. This
hasn’t stopped Southside from be-
ing the most popular hall meaning
that oversubscription has led to many
freshers being asked to take up resi-
dence in one of the other halls.
Brian May hands in thesis
Queen guitarist Brian May finally
handed in his thesis after leaving Impe-
rial College over 30 years ago. The rock
legend studied physics completing his
undergraduate studies as well as four
years worth of postgraduate work.
However, he left the Blackett Labora-
tory for the music industry. In August
May returned to complete the thesis he
started all those years ago. Later in the
same month he was awarded his doc-
torate. So, that’s Dr Brian May to me
and you.
Imperial students’ spelling
ability questionable
Imperial genetic scientist Dr... Bernard
Lamb, published spelling mistakes
made by 75 different students. Also
a member of the Queen’s English So-
ciety, Dr... Lamb said that he was try-
ing to “put pressure on the education
establishment.”
Dr... Lamb said that he often had to
correct students more than once on the
same mistake. Some common spelling
mistakes include “son” instead of “sun”
and “seamam” instead of “semen”.

A Royal Visitor
The Queen paid a visit to Imperial to
present the College with its Charter
Of Independence. The Royal Charter
marked Imperial College London leav-
ing the University of London and be-
coming a university in its own right.
A special event was held inside the
main entrance to Imperial College.
The Queen and the Rector both made
speeches to staff, students and alumni
before the very first Imperial degrees
were presented to a number of im-
portant figures including the Duke of
Edinburgh.
Heathrow expansion
protestors
Climate change protestors set up camp
on Imperial College owned land in
Harlington, near to Heathrow airport.
The Camp for Climate Change protes-
tors were campaigning against the ex-
pansion of Heathrow airport.
Imperial became involved because
the protestors were camped illegally
on land owned by College. The site in
Harlington is home to a sports ground
and a number of pitches used by Impe-
rial students. Felix staff even ventured
out of our dungeon and to the sports
ground to take the picture above.
