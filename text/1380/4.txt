Since we’ve been gone...
A lot has happened since Felix was last printed. Here’s a rundown of the main news from over the summer
Felix printing halted
Felix was stopped in its tracks last term
when the Honorary Senior Treasurer,
Dr.. Sunny Bains, refused to allow any
more cheques to be signed.
Felix printing costs are largely paid
for using money generated from ad-
vertising, however, invoicing and pay-
ment for adverts takes place after an is-
sue has been published. Consequently,
Felix often operates with a deficit until
advertising revenue comes through.
The last issue of Felix was printed on
11 May 2007.
Felix returns
3,200 copies of the Freshers’ Special Is-
sue of Felix were published last Friday.
The issue was put into freshers’ wel-
come packs ready for them to read
upon arriving in halls. Cradled in your
hands now is the first “proper” issue of
year. If you’re not fortunate to own a
copy of the Freshers’ Special Issue, you
can head to felixonline.co.uk where
you’ll find a selection of the articles.
Aside from the new colour scheme
and lots of cats at the tops of pages,
Felix has a few new sections including
photography, How To.../How Not To...
and Challenge The Sabbs along with
some old favourites. Watch this space.
Defamatory Policy passed
College took steps to protect itself
from libelous or slanderous forms of
student media. Council voted to pass
the policy and as a result College now
has the power to impound anything
that it deems defamatory, even if the
author or editor disputes the claims.
Defamatory material is helpfully de-
fined as: “the publication of a statement
that which tends to lower a person in
the estimation of right-thinking mem-
bers of society generally.” That should
make crystal clear what you can/can’t
rant about in the Comments section.
GSA Election farce
The summer saw a long and protract-
ed election which sought to appoint
the new GSA Chair amongst other
positions.
10 people voted in the initial election
and due to this abysmal turnout it was
decided to rerun the election later in
the summer.
Trustee Board takes shape
As part of a large and ongoing Union
governance restructuring, the Trus-
tee Board Chair was appointed. Ram
Gidoomal has taken up the position.
At the moment, the committee is an
Interim Trustee Board whilst the rest
of the board members are appointed
before it matures into a full flavoured
Trustee Board.
The Trustee Board was set up to be
the sovereign and governing body of
Imperial College Union. In short, the
Trustee Board functions to ensure
that the rest of the Union is running
smoothly and successfully.
Before the formation of the Trustee
Board, Council was the highest point
of authority within the Union. This re-
mains intact, along with the multitude
of other committees but instead they
are superseded by the almighty power
of the Trustee Board. There is at least
one meeting each term and anyone is
welcome to attend. So come along!
Linstead closes its doors
Linstead Hall’s doors closed to students
for the final time in June before its
demolition which began the following
month. At a small press gathering in
July, the Rector took a sledgehammer
to the entrance doors signifying the
end of Linstead Hall and the beginning
of the construction of Eastside which is
due for completion in 2009.
Union awning
In light of the recent smoking ban,
the Union has decided to construct
an awning in Beit Quad. The awning
(shown mid-construction) will provide
a sheltered area for people to stand.
Along with the nose warmers smokers
will be puffing on, the Union intends
to place patio heaters underneath the
awning. It is hoped the awning will at-
tract more people to the bars by pro-
viding a warm (and dry) area for peo-
ple to gather outside.
GSA Chair elected, finally
Last year’s Deputy President (Finance
and Services), Jon Matthews was final-
ly allowed to sit on the Graduate Stu-
dents Association throne after winning
the rerun of the GSA Chair election.
Matthews had no opposition in the
rerun aside from RON (re-open nomi-
nations). RON fought gallantly but
Matthews pulled through winning by
58 votes to 42. The GSA Chair is there
to represents postgraduate views and
voice them to the Union and College.

HSBC graduate overdraft
debacle
HSBC decided that it was going to be-
gin charging students that have gradu-
ated from university 9.9% on their
overdrafts.
Understandably, this rather sudden
decision was jumped upon by gradu-
ates and students soon to finish their
degrees especially since other banks
had not decided to implement these
charges.
However, thousands of students who
kicked up a fuss on Facebook shouted
loud enough for the banking corpo-
ration to take notice. Subsequently,
HSBC reversed their decision.
NHS Imperial
In September it was announced that
the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS
Trust and St Mary’s Hospital NHS
Trust will merge on 1st October to be-
come the Imperial College Healthcare
NHS Trust.
The newly formed Trust will be the
largest in the UK and will form the
UK’s first Academic Health Science
Centre (AHSC).
The idea of the Super Trust is to
bring together research, teaching and
patient health care so that it benefits
everyone. In theory, researchers will
have a greater pool of people to learn
from and patients will benefit from ex-
pert professionals.
