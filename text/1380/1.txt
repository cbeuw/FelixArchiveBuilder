College took steps to protect itself
from libelous or slanderous forms of
student media. Council voted to pass
the policy and as a result College now
has the power to impound anything
that it deems defamatory, even if the
author or editor disputes the claims.
Defamatory material is helpfully de-
fined as: “the publication of a statement
that which tends to lower a person in
the estimation of right-thinking mem-
bers of society generally.” That should
make crystal clear what you can/can’t
rant about in the Comments section.
The summer saw a long and protract-
ed election which sought to appoint
the new GSA Chair amongst other
positions.
10 people voted in the initial election
and due to this abysmal turnout it was
decided to rerun the election later in
the summer.
ge and ongoing Union
governance restructuring, the Trus-
tee Board Chair was appointed. Ram
Gidoomal has taken up the position.
At the moment, the committee is an
Interim Trustee Board whilst the rest
of the board members are appointed
before it matures into a full flavoured
Trustee Board.
The Trustee Board was set up to be
the sovereign and governing body of
Imperial College Union. In short, the
Trustee Board functions to ensure
that the rest of the Union is running
smoothly and successfully.
Before the formation of the Trustee
Board, Council was the highest point
of authority within the Union. This re-
mains intact, along with the multitude
of other committees but instead they
are superseded by the almighty power
of the Trustee Board. There is at least
one meeting each term and anyone is
welcome to attend. So come along!
