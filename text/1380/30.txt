felix needs you!
Felix is written by students for
students. We need your contributions
so that we can report on news stories
and keep everybody entertained
during the most arduous of lectures.
Felix needs an army of staff writers with the freedom

articles

• to set cryptic or quick
crosswords
Design editors

mistakes to form part of a crack team
Come and see us at Freshers’ Fair next to the
