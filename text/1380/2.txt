£384,000 skeleton in
Union finance closet
Union budgets are already under strain
this year after an audit of the Union’s
accounts brought to light a mysteri-
ous lack of reserve funds. The deficit
of £384,000 was traced to a decision
taken two years ago to dip into the
General Reserve, an amount designed
to keep the Union financially solvent
in the case of a catastrophe, in order
to partially fund Phase 1 of the Beit
Masterplan.
The Masterplan is the long-term re-
development plan for the main Union
buildings and Quad that started work
in summer 2006, and is designed to
update our ageing facilities. The deci-
sion to dip into the fund was taken two
years ago by Union Council, which at
the time was the supreme governing
body of ICU, under the control of Un-
ion President Sameena Misbahuddin
and Council Chair John Collins.
Investigation into this allocation
of funds is ongoing, but there is con-
fusion over how such an ill-advised
decision was taken by the 2005/06
Sabbaticals with so little discussion
appearing in the official minutes, and
without a vote being taken specifically
on the issue. The current Union Depu-
ty President responsible for Finance &
Services, Chris Larvin, has stated that
this decision “should never have been
authorised,” as it has left the Union
General Reserve with only £400,000
at present. The estimated “healthy”
amount for the Union Reserve is just
under £1million.
Revelation of this substantial finan-
cial hole so early in the year has hit the
Union hard, and could affect spending
for several years to come. “It looks like
we’ll all have to tighten our belts this
year”, said Union President Stephen
Brown. Spending controls are expect-
ed to be tightened across the Union
following the news that it is consider-
ably less financially secure than it was
originally thought. Clubs and Societies
are being urged to only spend if they
are certain that they can afford the ex-
penditure from their current balance.
How long it will take the Union to re-
plenish its emergency reserves remains
to be seen. The extent of the damage
is still being calculated, and initial re-
Union’s emergency fund spent on Beit Quad redevelopment
ports on repercussions are mixed, but
an air of caution pervades the Union
until a full assessment is completed.
The hole was discovered following
scrutiny of the Union accounting sys-
tem prior to an updating of our cur-
rently arcane financial arrangements.
Sources close to Beit Towers (home of
the Union Sabbatical Officers) say that
this lack of diligence by Council is pre-
cisely the reason that the Trustee board
is being created and given supervisory
control of major Union expenditure in
the future.

“Pay up or the mascots get it”
In the first week of September, Engi-
neers from the City and Guilds Union
(CGCU) were responsible for the pil-
fering of the Royal School of Mines’
(RSM) mascot, Davey the Davy lamp.
This is the beginning of the revival
of City and Guilds to its former glory
days, after the poor management it saw
last year.
The Rules of Mascotry, which has
been all but dead for the last five years
at Imperial, allow theft of the ‘violate’
mascots of the Unions for the purpose
of raising money for Raising-And-Giv-
ing charities, in the form of a ransom
demand payable to IC RAG. The rules
exist to promote friendly rivalry be-
tween the colleges, all in the name of
fun and sportsmanship.
Davey is being held to ransom for
£200 (rising to £300 after 11th Octo-
ber), and is being stored in a secret
and inaccessible location to prevent
the miners being able to steal it back
without paying their dues. Alongside
the monetary ransom demand came
another humiliation for the RSM: to
concede their loss, the historical soci-
ety of the Geology department, “De La
Beche Society”, named after the RSM’s
founder, is to be renamed “GeoSoc” for
one year.
The raid came only one week after
David Charles, the RCSU’s Vice Presi-
dent (operations), was heard denounc-
ing mascotry as dead and claiming
“nobody cares about it any more”.
Initially, Davey’s minor counterpart
“Practice Davey” was also stolen, but
has since been returned as it is invio-
late and thus not allowed to be stolen,
after meetings with Danny Hill of the
RSM, in exchange for the return of
the CGCU President’s tankard to their
place behind the Union Bar.
Davey and Practice Davey are pic-
tured alongside Spanner, the 43-year-
old CGCU mascot, a solid brass span-
ner weighing in at 64lb. The ends of
Spanner are thought to fit the bolts of
London Bridge.
