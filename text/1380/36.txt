Day 5 was
finally the
blue skies and
sunshine we’d longed
for. Once in our supplies
town of Courmayeur, siesta put
paid to us obtaining supplies, so
we were forced to eat ice-cream
in the sunshine. Boy, was it tough.
Finally stocked up with pasta and
more cheese, we began climbing
a steep zigzag track amongst the
cool shade of trees until Cour-
mayeur was a toy village, 700m
below. Rising over a final bluff we
had a stunning view of Mont Ché-
tif, and, from the camping ground
above a refuge (2000m), finally
views of Mont Blanc itself. Just as
we set up camp, a farmer drove
his cow herd around our tents un-
til we were surrounded!
Day 6 promised fine weather so
the alarm was set for sunrise to
see Mont Blanc. We reached the
peak of Tête Bernade (2534m) for
elevenses and found a suit-
able patch of snow
for a snowball fight. It had stupen-
dous 360° views to Col de la Seign
(crossed on day 3) and onwards
to Grand col Ferret (tomorrow’s
target). Lunch concluded with
sledging down a snow field on
survival sacks. The climb to the
second col was interrupted by our
first sighting of an ibex; Wilfred’s
super zoom lens was quickly put
into action. We wandered down
Val Malatra and stayed the night
in the luxurious Rifugio Bonatti.
Charlie set us a good pace on
day 7 along a stunning contour-
ing path above Val Ferret. By
midday it was pretty damn hot,
not helping the steepness of the
climb, so we lunched on a glori-
ous spur with valley and glacial
views just below the Grand col
Ferret (Swiss-Italian border). The
unending descent that afternoon
tired us all out, but Honorary Mo-
rale Officer Al brought the spirit
back to the group with a good ol’
sing-song. Tired and weary we ar-
rived at La Fouly in time to meet
Matt and Martin who arrived
on the bus. We wined and dined
out at a restaurant to celebrate
the week’s achievements thus far
and to say farewell to Monica and
hello to newcomers.
After a rest day and our
numbers now swelled
to 11, day 9
was an-
other ‘easy’ route to break the
newbies in. At the very serene
Champex Lac, and with only the
merest hint of sunshine, Al, Dave
and Anna couldn’t resist a dip,
whilst the rest of us explored the
extensive local patisserie coun-
ter. Once camped at we cooked
dinner (which included dried
onions, more on these later) and
heard that bad weather might
thwart the next’s day’s crossing of
the Fenêtre d’Arpette.
Day 10. The pre-5am alarm sig-
nalled a long day – we would at-
tempt the highest, toughest cross-
ing of the TMB before the weather
turned! In the calm morning we
made steady progress up the val-
ley, with the view behind improv-
ing with every step. It was around
this time that the consequences
of the previous night’s meal were
solidifying (or not). The cause of
excess flatulence among all mem-
bers of the party was the inclusion
of too many onions in said meal.
We were dying an onion death in
this windless valley (although it
was powering us up the moun-
tain). Al even blew a hole in his
shorts. Upon reaching the tour’s
high point of 2665m we were sad-
ly rewarded with little view and
worsening rain. Tired, wet but
happy we arrived at
Le
Tim Scarbrough and his fellow fellwanderers go
for a quick walk around the base of Mont Blanc and find
themselves taking a slight detour on their way
hair-straighteners on tour! A Fell-
wanderers first!
Day 2 had undecided weather as
the trail wound among pastures,
rocks and then snow fields to our
first serious pass – at 2329m Col
du Bonhomme was quite a chilly
place. Just before reaching the
higher, second pass of the day the
weather came in, with thunder
threatening us. We successfully
navigated off the col through the
cloud and practically stumbled on
the planned night’s refuge appear-
ing eerily out of the mist. We ar-
rived in the nick of time: two min-
utes later golf ball sized hailstones
bombarded the landscape!
The weather had not improved
overnight, and day 3 saw two
inches of fresh snow. Conse-
quently we took the longer but
lower route via Les Chapieux.
By mid afternoon we crossed the
Col de la Seign (2516m), on the
Franco-Italian border, where the
weather was a little unforgiving
with strong winds.Following the
map rather than snow-prints we
quickly descended to snow fields,
pausing just long enough for Al to
plunge head first (with rucksack!)
down the slope. We’d intended to
camp by the Refuge Elisabetta but
with the howling wind and rain/
snow, and the option of a dry bed
for €17, only Chris was foolish
enough to pitch. With an easier
day following, the beers flowed
(especially in Anna’s case).
After Al had finished prancing
around in a toga and Anna’s hot
pants as Party Boy, day 4 included
a balcony path, which afforded us
excellent views down the valleys
Veni and Ferret, and across to the
cloud-clad Aiguilles Noir. The
path rose and fell over streams,
snow fields and past lakes,
at one of which we lunched
on more local cheese. The
campsite that afternoon
was sunny and had
enough space to play
Frisbee! The cold
wind after dinner
forced us to keep
active, right until
the frisbee had
to be hilariously
salvaged from a
tree using a tel-
ephone pole!
Fellwanderers Tour of Mont Blanc
T
he morning after
the end of the un-
dergraduate term
heralded the start
of the Fellwander-
ers Summer Tour; our destina-
tion: Mont Blanc. To be pre-
cise we weren’t about to join
the thousands to the summit
of Europe, but to embark on an
entire anticlockwise circum-
navigation of the Mont Blanc
Massif. The Tour du Mont
Blanc would lead us from
France into Italy and Switzer-
land, before reappearing back
into France, twelve days and
several kilometres later. The
TMB is one of Europe’s most
popular long-distance moun-
tain walks; however with
much snow still lying, this was
the beginning of the season
and the trails would not be
full. We planned to camp for
the majority of nights to keep
costs down, but interspersed
with a few refuges for both
convenience and comfort.
It was a clear day in Les
Houches in the Chamonix val-
ley where nine of us convened
at the campsite, surrounded
by jaw-dropping snow-capped
Alps. By chance, the town fes-
tival was that very evening,
so our tour kicked off in style
with celebrations around an
over-zealous bonfire, music
and a BBQ.
Day 1 began under blue
skies and the group’s first (of
many) tastes of my pre-mixed
cocaine-look-alike Readybrek
mix. Col de Voza (1653m)
was breached at midday with
tremendous views up to the
Bionnassay glacier. Fond pre-
vious tour memories came
flooding back once the moun-
taineer’s lunch of hunks of
bread, large blocks of cheese
(which featured considerably)
and dried sausage were got
out. We refuelled at a cool wa-
ter trough, drenched our caps
and refilled our water pistols.
During the final stretch along
the Montjoie valley Monica
was requested to extract the
first-aid kit, and it transpired
she had brought self-powering
