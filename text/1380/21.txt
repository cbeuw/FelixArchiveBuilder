Want to find one of the 260+ clubs
that Imperial College Union has,
then read on. The day is all about
visiting as many different clubs
and societies as you can find. Then
again, if you have a burning desire to
find one club (such as the Handball
club!) look at the index page and
find them on the map. Once you’ve
found them visit their stall and find
out a bit more about the club.
As a rough guide, in the Great Hall
you’ll find the overseas societies.
The large marquee on Queen’s
Lawn is full of sports clubs, and
external stalls giving away freebies.
There is also a stage setup in the
marquee where you can catch
club demonstrations and live
music. While around the base of
the Queen’s Tower you’ll find the
motoring clubs and some of the
larger objects that clubs own, plus
all the media moguls you could ever
want to meet. There will be tours up
the Queen’s Tower during the day,
however places are very limited so
get there with plenty of time. The
Main Dining Hall (MDH) is stuffed
with arts clubs and more companies
handing out freebies. Inside the
Junior Common Room you’ll find
the food and drink societies. The Sir
Alexander Fleming building is the
place for clubs run by the Medics
Students’ Union, and these are open
to all. Follow the walkway ramp up
from the Queen’s Lawn to Upper
Dalby Court. In this area you will
find a variety of societies including
the Royal College of Science Union
and City and Guilds College Union,
and all the religious and ideological
societies. If you are into outdoor
type clubs, then head over to Beit
Quad, where there will be a rotating
climbing wall for you to have a go at
amongst other things.
The stalls are spread out all
over campus and there will be
volunteer officers walking around
in red T-shirts who will be happy
to help you. If you are hungry or
want to take a break, there will be
barbecues in the Quad and on the
Queen’s Lawn. To quench your
thirst the Union bars will be open
as well. Once you have finished for
the day and you’ve decided which
clubs and societies you want to
join, just login to the Union website
at imperialcollegeunion.org. There
you’ll find that each club has a page
and a shop for you to buy individual
lessons or membership for the full
year.
Finally why not join us at the Union
in the evening for a few celebratory
drinks, there are entertainments on
all night long!
