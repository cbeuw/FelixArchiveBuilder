The grand finale of
a coveted franchise,
millions of fans in the making and pre-
sumably more spent in marketing will
have culminated in that one sialoquent
outburst hissing through your stand-
ard issue Xbox Live headset.
Halo 3 has arrived riding upon one
the largest proverbial waves of hype
and fervour easily surpassing that of
Metal Gear Solid 2 when it wowed
gamers oh-so long ago.
But the thing is, in recent years, flag-
ship titles have become so much than
videogames; they’re standard bearers
of the interactive medium, they repre-
sent financial gains exceeding those of
other forms of media and more signifi-
cantly, they are the deities of the new
wave of culture.
For newcomers and hardcore, beer-
chugging Live acolytes alike, let us look
upon the raison d’être of Microsoft’s
entire games division, Halo 3.
Anyone with sufficient spelling skills
and functioning fingers will already
have browsed the necessary informa-
tion pertinent to the world of Halo at
their local Google search. We’ll save
the rest of you the trouble by summa-
rising the basic gist of the series.
Halo is the veritable Stars Wars of
the thumbstick generation. A science-
fiction space opera of suitably epic pro-
portions, Halo places you in a world
where the human race is, quite frankly,
getting their asses handed back to them
by an (painfully) obviously technologi-
cally advanced kindred of aliens called
the Covenant. To combat this threat,
the free peoples of the world unleash
the Master Chief – a genetically en-
hanced soldier destined to scrape Cov-
enant entrails from his military-issue
Spartan boots. His overture adventure
landed him on the strange ring-world
of the titular Halo where he battled
the alien threat, made some startling
discoveries and found a group of re-
pugnant failed experiments called the
Flood. In the end, he somehow man-
aged to destroy the sinister artifact
but the fight was only beginning...
The second escapade saw the Master
Chief return to defend Earth against
the Covenant blitzkrieg. Fans were
also surprised that the Chief’s story
was one part of a dichotomy that
would become a point of dissent for
many. The other half of the story was
proffered by the Arbiter, one of the
Covenant Elites who discovers that
his side are suffering from
severe family dysfunc-
tion. Combined, they
weaved a narrative
that impressed
the wide-eyed
and presuma-
bly drew all-
knowing
chuckles
from any-
one who
bothers
to watch
the news.
That’s
Halo in a
(somewhat
ripped
apart)
nutshell.
Where
does this leave us with Halo 3? Upon
the precipice of a great battle, one
that is critical in determining the fate
of the human race. The apocalyptic
revelation about the true nature of
the Halos doesn’t make things easier
to swallow. If you’ve been living un-
der a rock, the Halos are basically the
planetary equivalents of WMDs (yes, I
went there)... the only difference is that
they actually exist... and there are six of
them remaining. Yikes.
Criticism aside, Halo’s storyline
comes across as an inspiring, epic es-
capade, snugly entrenched within an
intriguing universe of its own creation.
Despite having the depth of the com-
mon garden hose (same colour, too),
the laconic, resilient Master Chief is
veritably an All-American™ icon of lib-
erty and fraternity, with equality being
damned to heck. He’s an elite soldier
after all.
From a gameplay perspective, Halo
has made significant contributions to
the shooter
genre,
al-
beit in some cases thrusting previously
used mechanics into the limelight and
making them seem fresh and new.
Thanks to Bungie, shooters after Halo
can boast the strategic armament of
only two weapons, re-charging shields/
life bars and a general broadening of
the FPS spectrum. These changes have
allowed for enjoyable shifts in pacing
and strategy, and to be honest, we’re
all the more better for it. Significantly,
the design of the combat in Halo gives
weight to the characters, making them
tangible targets in space rather than
erratically spasmodic polygon models
that curse so many other games. FPS
titles of the current ilk are strongly
indebted to the evolutionary, and oft
revolutionary, machinations of Halo.
However, all these pale in compari-
son in light of the multiplayer com-
ponent. From a offline, limited player
experiment in Halo, the second game
burst onto the scene with an all-sing-
ing, all-dancing multiplayer mode that
has become so prominent and perva-
sive that it is the very definition
of online console gaming. Nice.
Even within the offline space,
Halo 2 offered a robust, ho-
listic communal experi-
ence that relentlessly en-
tertains three years on.
It’s fair to say that Halo
is a fantastic multiplay-
er series with a solid
single player patch and
an entertaining fan-
fiction attached.
Bungie have truly transformed a
risky business undertaking into an en-
tire culture. Cutting a swathe through
the PR excretion that is the current
marketing drive of Halo 3, we can see
how far and wide the previous titles
have taken the Xbox. Not only a signif-
icant part of the gaming life of count-
less university students (moreso in the
USA than here), Halo is also the base
for one of the most popular machi-
nama on the Internet. (Machinama is
the art of using videogames to create
visual media like shows and films.) Red
vs Blue completed its century-episode
run sometime near the end of June this
year. Wildly popular, it was a relatively
aimless sitcom that starred a motley
crew of personable characters making
up either the eponymous Red or Blue
teams. Both start out in conflict with
each other but soon, things get a little
messy and largely hilarious. A film is
currently in the making (with myriad
setbacks), but the fact that they have
Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson
onboard as a producer gives whim to
the scope and ambition of the project.
Recent nods to the world of Halo are
less than savoury boiling down to mass
market, shameless advertising ranging
from the Master Chief-themed Moun-
tain Dew Game Fuel to a figurine-based
montage clearly aimed at swaying the
hearts of an impressionable public.
There was also the Halo-themed Fer-
ris wheel at the Games Convention in
Germany if the pictures online are to
be believed and stomached. However,
it’s safe to say that fans of the series
will overlook these embarrassments
and plough on towards their Canaan...
and it’s really one pilgrimage you
wouldn’t want to miss as well.
At the end of the day, Halo 3
will go on to break record sales,
entrenching itself within the
gaming community and find-
ing juxtaposition as a premier
videogame, a poster child of
the interactive medium. In
a year that saw the grace-
ful ending of the similarly
gargantuan Harry Pot-
ter franchise, one
wonders what
honour awaits
the Master
Chief.
There’s subtlety, and then there’s a genetically-enhanced supersoldier with half an army in his backpack
The Heavy & Friends
Temporary Editors
G
reetings, folks. It’s the
Team Fortress 2 team
here, personified by a
mystery editor while this
year’s Games team gets
themselves into formation. What have
we got for you this year? Nothing. Be-
cause we’re fictional. Even if you can do
a hilarious impression of The Heavy.
However, Felix Games has a lot in
store for you this year. We’ve missed
some of the biggest releases of the year
during Summer – Team Fortress 2’s
beta is well underway, Halo 3 comes
out the day this first issue goes to press,
BioShock has already split opinion
across the gaming world, and Super
Paper Mario finally found his way onto
the Wii.
And there’s more to come – Portal
and Episode 2 will follow Team For-
tress 2’s official release this October,
there’s the fallout from Halo 3’s mul-
tiplayer impact on the scene, as well
as the usual Christmas rush that’ll be
packed full of games you want, but
can’t afford, and then buy anyway and
go without food for a month. It’s the
way of the gamer.
For those new to Imperial, and for
those whose memories of last year are
hazy, Felix Games would love writers.
We want anyone who’s able to put pen
to paper – you don’t need to be well-
established journalists, you just need
to have a passion for gaming and a
willingness to take criticism. If you’d
like to write features, comment pieces,
reviews or other stuff for us, drop us a
line on the email address at the top of
this page.
We’re hoping to branch out this year.
Not us personally, obviously,because of
the fictional thing still, but the section
as a whole. We want gamers from every
walk of life to take part in Felix, to keep
things interesting and arrange events
for us. We’ll still be working closely
with Imperial’s Computer Games Club
(CGC) to keep you abreast of their up-
coming tournaments, and we might
even get some gaming sessions of our
own arranged.
However you’re playing this Winter,
we hope Felix Games has something
to offer you. If there’s something you
want to see more of, or if you’re sick
of the sight of something we’re doing
already, please email us and tell us. We
might be too busy playing Halo 3 un-
til our eyes dry up, but someone will
eventually read it and do something
about it.
As for the guys here, we’re off to
2Fort to call people nubs and shout
pewpewpew whilst generally spam-
ming and pissing everyone off to the
highest degree possible. You might be
familiar with our work in every single
online game, ever. We hope you enjoy
it here too.
See you online. Normal service will
be resumed next issue.
Good Doctor! Good!
