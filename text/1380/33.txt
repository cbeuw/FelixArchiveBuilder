London Fashion Week gets ethical
From organic cotton Tees to fairtrade shoes, eco-fashion was the word on everyone’s lips at LFW
Hannah Theodorou
Katherine Hamnett’s
back with her ground-
breaking statement
T’s. Tackling
issues as
diverse as
war, religion
and the
environment,
these classic boyish
T-shirts have been
seen on everyone from
Lily Cole to Liz Hurley.
They’re available online
or from most Urban
Outfitters stores.

I don’t know why it’s so exciting when
the ticket to London Fashion Week
drops into my inbox. The word fashion
seems to grate nerves at the moment –
disposability seems to be the key with
everyone from Primark to Asda spew-
ing out catwalk copies at rock bottom
prices. Primark sold a quarter of a mil-
lion military jackets in 2005 while Tes-
co sells 30,000 pairs of £3 jeans a week.
Charity shops can no longer deal with
the rate at which items are turning up
at their doorstep, some of which are
unworn. These cheap items are hard
to shift however – when people can
buy them for next to nothing at the su-
permarket next door few want to rum-
mage through overburdened rails at
Oxfam The rate at which these unsel-
lable items are turning up on the doors
of charity shops is unprecedented –
the fact that charity shops are turning
clothes away is a sign of the bad shape
the industry is in. When clothes aren’t
on rails or in wardrobes they end up in
landfill.
All these reasons and more mount up
to the reason I am tired of seeing the
Victorias and Paris’ flaunting the latest
trend. And why I applaud those who
appreciate a good investment when
they see one. Why buy 5 soon-to-be-
binned items at £5 a pop from Primark
when the same can be spent on a versa-
tile organic T-shirt which will see you
through at least the next 4 seasons? It’s
time to question how we can buy jeans
for £3 when we know the people who
made them were bullied into making
them for next to nothing.
When I trotted round the exhibition
stands at LFW in my never-out-of-
fashion because it was never in fashion
dress and vintage boots it was interest-
ing to see how people responded when
they saw the title “FELIX – THE STU-
DENT NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL
COLLEGE” emblazoned under my
name if I had forgotten to strategically
cover it (mental note – must get last
section removed for February). Most
screwed up their nose and feigned
an interested smile while they peered
over my head for Vogue’s style editor
instead. Not so at Esthetica, the Ethical
fashion exhibition now in its third run
at LFW. It showcases designers who
have put thought into more than just
securing their place at the front of the
fashion pages. That’s not to say they’re
not worth a fashionista’s attention. The
brands featured have been seen on the
likes of Lily Cole, Liz Hurley, Keira
Knightly and Natalie Portman. They’ve
all earned their place at the Esthetica
kstands through attention to things like
the source of their materials, the rights
of the people who made them and how
long they will stay in a person’s ward-
robe before being turfed out.
Leading the crowd was Katherine
Hamnett whose iconic T-shirts have
been making headllines for years. Each
100% organic cotton top is made in In-
dia where workers recieve a fair wage.
So if you think ‘Leaders Suck’ or that
you should ‘Choose Life’ head down to
Urban Outfitters or visit her website to
get your hands on one.
Highlighting the hazards of the cot-
ton industry, The Environmental Jus-
tice Foundation campaigns for safer
working conditions for cotton growers.
Cotton makes up 40% of world fibre
consumption, but it is also one of the
dirtiest. Its heavy reliance on hazard-
ous chemicals poisons farmers, soil
and water.
Other brands such as ‘From Some-
where’, “Worn Again’ by Terra Plana
and ‘Gary Harvey’ work almost en-
tirely with recyled materials giving a
new lease of life to factory leftovers
and candy wrappers. Now there’s food
for thought.

This winter the catwalks are all point-
ing towards the masculine office suits,
military coats and the strong silhouette.
With all the male orientated apparel
gracing our wardrobes, the only way to
keep your look from drowning in tes-
tosterone is to add a few choice pieces
of bling. London Fashion Week was the
perfect platform for budding jewellery
designers to exhibit their wares. Alex
Munroe was the clear winner when it
came to elaborate design. Inspired by
his love for wildlife, the Autumn/Win-
ter collection is a must for anyone who
wants a little bit of the great outdoors,
in their small indoors.
Clara Francis is another designer
to look out for. Her innovative use of
beads to form various animals as neck-
laces, which not only look chic but also
modern, is something that I thought
couldn’t be done. The ex-West End
performer decided to teach her-
self old beading techniques,
during the long gaps between
performances. Francis’ collec-
tions have recently featured in
Elle, Cosmopolitan
and Vogue.
All that glitters makes up the best of the rest
Fancy mingling with
the fashion crowd? And
perhaps stocking up on
a few freebie samples....
We’re thinking of holding
our very own Ethical
Fashion Show with some
of the brands featured
here. If you’d like to get
involved in organising
the event email ic.esoc
for more details.
People Tree is one of the best-
established ethical brands
around. All its clothes are
100% Fair Trade throughout
manufacture (and 100%
wearable). Look out for it’s new
Capsule Collection tailored to
the needs of today’s fashion
crowd. It’s available online and
in Topshop’s flagship store in
Oxford Circus.
