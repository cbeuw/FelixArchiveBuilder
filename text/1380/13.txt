National Novel Writing Month 07
Michael Cook believes you have a story to tell him. Are you sitting comfortably? Then he’ll begin
T
he website of the National
Novel Writing Month
takes a rather softly-
softly approach to its
wording in order to
attract quiet, literary types, so if
you’re one of the delicate ones
I suggest you skip on right to
the end where I’ve typed the
site address in italics, and
scurry along to the cool safety
of what’s known as NaNoW-
riMo by those that take part.
If there’s one thing I’ve learnt
through three years of try-
ing to get people to enter the
damn thing, it’s that no-one
does it if you’re nice to them.
Everyone else should sit down,
shut up, and read on.
Have you ever wanted to
write a story? Bear in mind
I’m not asking whether Eng-
lish is your first language, or
whether you’ve taken writ-
ing lessons, or whether your
mother and father nurtured
your creative abilities from a
young age, lending you lamp-
light, quills, a steady supply of
ink and a mentor named Al-
bert. I mean, did you play make-
believe games as a child? Did you
ever think that your favourite TV
show or film could do a bit better in
some parts? Did you ever read a book
that you thought missed something
out? Because the funny thing is that
most people do have a desire to write,
and everyone – everyone – can.
Oh, but you’re worried about not
being so good, right? Well, you’re
not good. Let’s not be silly here, with
your attitude you’re probably terrible
at writing right at this moment. But a
month’s worth of solid writing is going
to change that, and it’s going to change
you. So here’s what you’re going to do
this November – you’re going to write
fifty-thousand words of original fic-
tion. You’re going to do it because if
you don’t do it right now, right this
year, right here at Imperial, then you
never will. That’s the what. You know
what you’re going to do. Here’s why.
The why is very simple – firstly,
we’ve established that you think it
would be A Pretty Cool Thing To Do.
Forget about the idea of writing al-
most two thousand words a day for a
second, and imagine waltzing around
in December with a novel under your
belt, a novel that no-one ever needs to
read, but that you can be proud of, and
slip into conversation with the casual
air of a young Jeffrey Archer. “Oh golly,
darling, it’s been so long! Yes, I know.
You know, I would have, but I was just
finishing off my novel, and you know
what it’s like when you’ve done forty-
five kay already, mmm?”
Although it should be pointed out,
most people don’t do it in order to add
a dash of smarminess to parties. The
real reason for someone such as your-
self to do NaNoWriMo is because now
is the time you’ll flesh out the person
you are. You’re more free than you ever
have been, and yet not burdened with
the full weight of decision-making.
You’re busy enough to justify the large
amounts of free time that you have, but
not so busy that the time is unusable.
Most of all, you’ve got your dreams,
and your chances to reach out for them
are thinning out. Don’t be fooled, those
of you who dream of a high-paying job
that’ll retire you at thirty-five. It’s now
that you’ll do the things your grand-
children will hear about, not then.
The idea began with just a few
friends, but now spans the globe and
will lead more than forty thousand
people to the goal of fifty-thousand
words this November when it kicks off
for its ninth year. It’s a group that’s now
organised, a fully-fledged charity that’s
set up children’s libraries in Vietnam
and Lagos thanks to donations from the
people who were encouraged to write
their first, then second, then maybe
sixth novel. But at the same time, it’s
still a simple bunch of people work-
ing behind a simple idea – that writing
is fun, and not enough people realise
that. To that end, they encourage, egg
on and sometimes push you towards
the goal that, at times, will seem even
further off than it does now.
There are weekly podcasts, local
meets with like-minded writers, and an
online forum buzzing with orphaned
novel ideas, experts on every conceiv-
able topic, and people who are just as
worried and confused as you are. And
yes, they probably got tricked by some
student journalist too.
And if that’s not your thing, then you
can work in complete isolation – even
the word checker that deals out your
certificate at the end of November is
entirely automated, and so if you want
it to be a private thing, they’re just as
happy to have you. They have people
writing by hand, writing in Greek,
writing novels to get published or just
writing. They don’t even force you to
donate money to their cause – they’re
just there to give you an idea to get
started, and a reason to keep going.
This year, Felix wants to do the same.
So we’ll be covering the National Novel
Writing Month in a series of short re-
ports during November, as well as some
warmup articles this October. If you’ve
entered before, please get in touch with
us and let us know more. If you’re go-
ing to attempt it this year, we’d love for
you to do the same. If you’re not sure
whether you can handle it, after all the
mixed metaphors and poor pep talks
I’ve attempted, I can only leave you
with this – it’s worth giving a chance.
The feeling of accomplishment, the
way the enthusiasm filters through
to other aspects of your life, and the
confidence it gives you in your day-to-
day living is unique and unbelievable.
Writing is a novel is something many
of us say we will do, one day. There are
thirty of those One Days coming up.
Make sure you’re ready for them.

Are You Serious? – FAQs
Who will read my novel when
I’m done?
Anyone you want. Last year,
some people swapped novels af-
terwards and it was a hoot. But
it’s entirely up to you. No one
will read your novel until you’re
ready for them to.
Is there a fee to participate?
There’s no sign-up fee, but we
do ask ably-financed participants
to contribute something towards
hosting and administrative costs.
The amount is up to you.
When do I start writing?
At 12:00:01 am local time on No-
vember 1.
How do you win? Are there
judges? What are the prizes?
The way to win NaNoWriMo is by
writing 50,000 words by midnight
on November 30. Every year,
there are many, many winners.
There are no “Best Novel” or
“Quickest-Written Novel” awards
given out. All winners will get an
official “Winner” web icon and
certificate.
Can I handwrite the novel?
Absolutely. We can’t verify your
word count, but verification is
just icing on the NaNoWriMo
cake.
What if I start and don’t finish?
That’s ok. Nothing ventured,
nothing gained, right?
Why are you doing this? What
do you get out of it?
NaNoWriMo is all about the
magical power of deadlines.
Give someone a goal and a goal-
minded community and miracles
are bound to happen. Pies will
be eaten at amazing rates. Alfalfa
will be harvested like never be-
fore. And novels will be written
in a month.
Part of the reason we organize
NaNoWriMo is just to get a book
written. For one month out of the
year, we can stew and storm, and
make a huge mess of our apart-
ments and drink lots of coffee at
odd hours. And we can do all of
these things loudly, in front of
people.
But that artsy drama window is
woefully short. The other reason
we do NaNoWriMo is because
the glow from making big, messy
art, and watching others make
big, messy art, lasts for a long,
long time. It changes the way
you read. And changes, a little
bit, your sense of self.
We like that.
How do you pronounce
NaNoWriMo?
NAN-no WRY-Mo.
Oh. I’ve been saying it NAN-no
WREE-Mo.
That’s ok too.
“So here’s
what you’re
going to do
this November
– you’re going
to write fifty-
thousand words
of original
fiction.”
