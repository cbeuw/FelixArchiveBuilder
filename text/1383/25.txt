ou’ll probably hear Felix
Games talk a lot about the
merits and idiosyncrasies
of the strange world of
gaming. Call us a bit bi-
ased perhaps, or maybe it’s just that
we tend to avoid trying to waste space
on otherwise egregious titles. It does
make for rather entertaining reading
though, so we’ve decided to really up
the ante. How about talking smack and
taking the piss... of classic, established
franchises. Starry, glazed eyes and coo-
ing sighs of fanboyism are wiped out
in favour of cynical staredowns and
snorts of derision just for the span of
one article. Then it’s back to waxing
lyrical.
Make no mistake: these articles don’t
represent the opinions of Felix Games
in general. Some of us in Felix actually
like these games. Fancy that.
That’s the gist of the new Flamebait
section and I’m confident that it’ll be
an interesting talking point during te-
dious tutorial classes. We dare you to
send us some Howlers.
While we’re still warming up, I
thought it would be a perfect time to
take some underhanded (yet oft per-
fectly justified) swipes at the coffer-
filled market that is the franchised
game. With a normal distribution
curve heavily skewed towards Poo out
of a rounded 100%, it really makes you
wonder why they bother creating such
offal... for all of five minutes. Then it’s
back to hacking away at generic evildo-
ers in Eragon. Mmmmmm, hackity-
slashity goooood.
Speaking of hackity-slashity fun, I
was contemplating a fresh chapter of
Flamebait and one game immediately
sprang to mind. It’s a game that’s lived
through many iterations – each one no
more than a graphical update and the
addition of rather trivial features. Yet
it’s so highly regarded by a gloriously
fanboyish community that the praise
borders on inanity. I think I’ve made
the title quite obvious by now and even
the blissfully ignorant lovers of this se-
ries know which game I speak of. So,
does anyone want to grab a dragon by
it’s balls and condemn this offender to
the depths of gaming Heck? Immortal-
ity, respect and certain death await you
but the portal to games.felix@imperial.
ac.uk remains as open as ever. Will you
accept this perilous quest?
Once again, we ignore any main-
stream titles to place the spotlight on
yet another one of the InterWeb’s fin-
est (and free-est, obviously) petite
games: Sphere.
In response to Tomo’s tirade regard-
ing J-RPG’s, I’ve literarily lashed out
with the second issue of Gairaigo. And
what better title to bring into the lime-
light than one of the most interesting
Japanese Role-Playing Games released
this year sans Final Fantasy moniker.
The rather difficult to pronouce Shin
Megami Tensei: Persona 3 is the fea-
tured game and I have a feeling that
it personifies pretty much everything
that he probably dislikes in his break-
fast J-RPGs. Office politics follow suit.
This week’s buzzword? Irreverence.

H
ow is it that despite the
sheer overindulgent
quality of some games,
they are unceremoni-
ously ousted from their
roost at the numero uno spot because
the words ‘Harry’ and ‘Potter’ decided
to juxtapose themselves on the jewel
case?
Quite frankly, it’s you lot to blame.
No, not you in general. I’m talking
about the person who’s wearing a
Gryffindor scarf as the weather turns
unpleasant. I’m talking about the per-
son whose fully articulated Optimus
Prime sits next to his or her screen,
taking precedence over an increasingly
dusty pile of textbooks. Okay, fine I’m
also talking about the casual fan as
well. I’m equally at blame here.
Yes I know that the Order of the
Phoenix for the PS2 has an average
Metascore of 61. Like most discerning
gamers, I do do a fairly comprehensive
bit of research when it comes to grudg-
ingly parting with my pound sterling
notes. Yet, I found out the score for this
game after buying it and I couldn’t care
less. Why is that?
It’s just a very depressing fact that
franchises sell. Not to make it sound
like it’s a bad thing, but in our little
world of videogames, it often is. That’s
the whole point of the interactive me-
dium – to let us get that much closer to
worlds, to wrought changes upon them
or at the very least, furtively glancing
around before gleefully blurting out
“wingardium leviosa” because hey, I
just made something float all by my-
self. As with any relatively well-known
franchise, we have a legion (understate-
ment, naturally) of fans who are wont
to gobble up all related paraphernalia.
The case has existed for years with
plastic toys being the most popular
avenue of aficionado investment. That
has given way in recent years towards
videogames. With ever-burgeoning at-
tach rate of home consoles, even the
non-gamer finds himself or herself
drawn to yet another form of his or
her object of adulation. Every recent
film adaptation and even some clas-
sics are to be blamed of having their
udders tweaked for golden globules of
videogame-centric income. Eric Can-
tona’s quote falls well in context here:
“When the seagulls follow the trawler,
it’s because they
think sardines
will be thrown in
to the sea”. Fans
are inexorably
drawn, regardless
of rationality.
And somewhere
along the way, de-
velopers caught
the scent of the
furtive fan. They
knew at that mo-
ment that beyond
any original gam-
ing IP they could
ever dream of
– be it the Mar-
ios and Half-Lifes
(Half-Lives?) –
nothing could tally
the revenue like
a communally established franchise.
Quality was no longer the issue here. A
rudimentary game is blasé to the gam-
ing populace, but the same game with
a Big Name™ attached to it was a pro-
verbial batch of hotcakes. The key in-
gredient: presentation. The more such
a piece of interactive merchandise can
draw the fan into their world of choice,
the better it is perceived as a ‘quality’
product. Once such groundwork was
established as a basic blueprint, the
games started pouring in. Significant
sums of money are paid to obtain the
licenses but such costs are all too easily
offset by the unusually large revenue
per unit values of videogames.
Games of this ilk are established
with fantastic touches mainly based on
countenance. Film tie-ins boast direct
footage that one might have to wait
weeks to see. Celebrity voice-overs, art
assets, collectible extras and the gen-
eral atmosphere of polish all add gravi-
tas to the purchase. Sometimes the
additions of entirely new scenarios or
assets (like characters and locales) en-
demic to the gaming iteration are major
draws. Basically, these are all cosmetic
commodities. It makes a fan’s heart feel
all warm and fuzzy... until the first cut-
scene stops and you start playing. More
often than not,
the same level of
quality refuses
to permeate into
what really mat-
ters for a videog-
ame: the gaming
portion. Poor
design, mun-
dane objectives,
technical issues,
camera problems
and other flaws
severely detract
from an other-
wise stunningly at-
tractive package.
While I’m sure
the teams behind
it have worked
hard at getting all
that coding onto
your disc, it’s clear that a certain level
of conviction was still lacking. Deep
in their hearts they know that this is
the kind of thing that’ll have their pay-
checks signed even if they decided to
skimp here, there and sometimes, eve-
rywhere. It seems quite stereotypical
to bring this to light, but that’s truly
the case.
While this seems a little archaic in
the light of an upswing in the quality of
videogames based on films and what-
have-you, there’s compelling evidence
that such a rise was more sporadic
than a genuine upheaval. Despite that,
there are still quality titles that cater to
both the obsessive need to collect and
the gamer within. The Lord of the Rings
titles are surprisingly competent and
fun games, while King Kong was a great
melange of cinematic presentation and
fairly fresh gameplay. The Chronicles of
Riddick, while not a direct tie-in, was
a fantastic game by its own right. Star
Wars games have a more capricious
history of quality ranging from pure
guilty pleasures to utter detritus. The
list of these not-crap titles can be de-
ceptively (although, not significantly)
long when considered subjectively.
Despite the average game buyer,
hardcore or otherwise, being more
consumer savvy, such titles are de-
signed to be an arrow to the Achilles’
heel really. You can be as self-aware of
the problems as much as you want but
at the end of the day, you will end up
walking away with a copy of Superman
Returns while the gods of common-
sense hurl curses and idioms at you.
