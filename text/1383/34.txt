One for the ladies this week
Chiraush Patel
Mr. Muscle
Sports league
This week, I would just like to send
a shout out to all my female readers!
Whether you’re attracted by the mind-
blowing photos on show, or just like to
leave this page open in front of your
podgy boyfriend (as a hint), you’ve
stuck through what may seem to have
been a testosterone tidal wave week af-
ter week. So this issue is for you, as I
offer you some advice on maximising
your gym sessions.
First and foremost if you are happy
with your body then don’t be coerced
into gyming for sake of other people.
Mr Muscle is a firm believer in self
love, not in that manner of course (un-
less it makes you happy…), but if you
think that you could do with some
guidance when it comes to working
out then you’re in the right place.
The free weights section of a gym is
often overlooked by the fairer sex. It
may appear to be an intense, intimi-
dating, machismo manic area, but look
past all that and you will find that free
weights are an amazing way to tone up
and really get results.
But won’t most guys just stare at me?
Nope. The truth is most of us genuine
weight lifters (aka non desperate men)
prefer to check out our form in the
mirror, so don’t feel intimidated and
think that all eyes are on you…unless
you’re really asking for it.
Why should I bother with weights?
It’s true, most women prefer to start
and end gym sessions on cardio ma-
chines, with some more cardio sand-
wiched in between, but this is an inef-
ficient way of toning. Recent studies
suggest that a split session of weights,
consolidated with cardio can result in
up to 100% more fat loss than cardio
alone. Whether you’re from Venus,
Mars or Planet Hollywood, that has
got to be music to your ears! So buck-
le up for a satisfying session with the
lean, mean, muscle machine, today and
every month, as I tackle the feminine
figure part by part, starting with my
favourite: legs.
The perfect set of pins is a holy grail
to most ladies, but their importance
runs deeper than the superficial, a
bit like Mr Muscle himself. The legs
contain the largest muscle in terms of
mass, and as such are akin to fat burn-
ing machines. By keeping them run-
ning you are making sure your body is
burning fat even when you’re enjoying
your cosmo, G&T or Carlsberg (shout
out to my lager lasses!). Plus it will help
you knock over the lads when you rock
the short skirts!
As with any workout session, start
your day with a 5 minute warm up run
then hit the listed leg workout. If you
have any problems don’t hesitate to ask
for advice from gym staff or myself if
you see me. Otherwise there is always
email.
Pile squats: stand erect with your
feet far wider than shoulder width, toes
angled out. Keep your back flat with
pelvis in, chest out and shoulders back,
holding the dumbbell rested down
in front of your body. Squat straight
down until your thighs are parallel
to the floor. Pause at the bottom and
without bouncing rise in a smooth,
controlled manner focusing on your
glutes and hams.
Stiff legged deadlift: stand erect
holding dumbbells in front of your
thighs with palms facing your legs.
Chest out, shoulders back, knees un-
locked and head facing forward relative
to your back. In a slow and controlled
motion, bend over and push your hips
back until your torso is nearly paral-
lel to the floor, keeping your back flat
throughout. Smoothly reverse the di-
rection and rise back up to standing.
Dumbbell squats with bench: posi-
tion a bench 6-8 inches behind you and
adopt the above starting position with
dumbbells by the side of your body.
Slowly descend, pushing your glutes
back until you gently touch the bench.
Without sitting on it smoothly reverse
the direction to return to the start-
ing position. Throughout the exercise
maintain a straight back.
Don’t thank me, I’m just doing my
job, but buy a drink and join me in a
toast- to a more beautiful gym!
Felix takes no responsibility if you
break yourself in half whilst trying
to lift weights that are clearly too
heavy for you. Man up!
Week 2 and a lot more results are in.
The ranking of the teams is based on
the Felix Index (FI), which is calculated
as follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) – (L*3).
Only teams with 5 games or more will
be considered in the overall champion-
ship at the end of year. With this weeks
results in, badminton move to 2nd
whilst the hockey men’s 3rds are at the
bottom of the table with -8 points.

My apologies for an error in last week’s
issue. The setter was supposed to be
named “Enoch”, not “Epoch” as it was
in fact written.
This week, you’re going to be served
up with another treat from Enoch.
That’s Enoch, not Epoch. I think I’ve
made the point now. Good, that’s set-
tled then.
Enjoy the crossword and send your
answers in to sudoku.felix@imperial.
ac.uk if you feel like it. Bye!
Tomo, on behalf of Enoch
