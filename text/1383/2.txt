Vacancies on Council
At midnight on Sunday, the nomina-
tion period for Council elections and
positions on the Trustee Board drew
to a close.
Two people are running for the two
Trustee Board positions available.
However, Council will remain without
all the committee positions filled even
if all of the candidates are successfully
elected.
There is supposed to be a fair rep-
resentation of the different faculties
on Council, as well as both an under-
graduate and postgraduate presence.
For example, out of the 16 positions
open to Ordinary Members (regular,
vanilla flavoured students) four places
are reserved for undergraduate engi-
neers and a further two for postgradu-
ate engineers.
However, only two people are run-
ning in the Undergraduate Natural Sci-

ences Councillor category; leaving two
positions unfilled for the time being
until the Union decides how it plans to
elect these students.
The remaining undergraduate cat-
egories are better contested though,
with four out of four engineers coming
forward. The Undergraduate Medicine
Councillor category sees a whopping
eleven students standing and they’ll be
duking it out for three positions.
Postgraduate representation is even
worse, with only one person standing
for a position as a Postgraduate Engi-
neering Councillor.
All candidates will be up against
a fearsome showing from RON (re-
open nominations). The electorate
can choose to vote RON if they believe
none of the candidates are suitable.
Candidates are currently in the proc-
ess of preparing their campaign strat-
egy meaning that manifestos should be
ready for publication in next week’s is-
sue of Felix and hustings is taking place
next Thursday 25th October in the
Junior Common Room at 12pm. Vot-
ing opens on the following day at one
minute past midnight, to be precise.
How and when the outstanding posi-
tions will be filled remains to be seen –
the Union is in the process of deciding
what to do next.
Last year’s Council nominations
were a far greater success, with every
position on the committee being con-
tested for and successfully elected.
Whether this year’s poor show is
down to the Union’s lack of promo-
tion, or a general disinterest in Council
amongst students is not clear

Beit: The biggest hall party
ever! Possibly, maybe...
On Tuesday and throughout the early hours of Wednesday morning,
quite possibly the largest semi-official hellamashup party ever was
held in Beit Hall corridors. Boys dressed as girls. Girls dressed as
boys. Geeks dressed as Mexicans and Mexicans dressed as Geeks
joined the Sluts and the Men in Black for what was to be an all-night
decadent extravaganza. A Piccadilly Court senior refuted claims that
this was the biggest party ever, saying: “Piccadilly Court bashes
last year make your shin-dig look like a five year-old kid’s birthday
party.” Beit seniors were unavailable for daft comment.
