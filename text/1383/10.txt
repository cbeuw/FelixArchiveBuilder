Money, money, money, it’s a student’s world!
With the education policy being the
way it is today many students cannot
afford to pay for their whole course
without the help of some additional
money, for most the best way to do this
is to take up some part-time work.
Taking up part-time work can be a
good thing for students helps you to
meet new people get to know the local
area and also learning new skills while
earning some money to spend on your
social activities or to help with living
costs.
Part-time work can also become a
bit of nightmare for students as well,
in some cases some unscrupulous
employers see at as a chance to take
advantage of students and get cheap
labour.
Before you start part-time work it
is good to know your basic rights so
you know when you are being treated
unfairly below is some information to
keep in mind when taking up a part-
time job:
Minimum Wage – The minimum
wage currently stands at £5.52 an hour
if you are aged over 22. If you are be-
tween 18-21 years old the minimum
wage is £4.60 an hour
If you are getting paid below these
amounts you may well be being treated
unfairly and should seek advice from
the Information and Advice Centre
(IAC).
Working time regulations – There
is a limit of 48 hours of working in a
week.
There is a limit of 8 hours work every
24 hours for night workers.
National Insurance Numbers – Eve-
ryone needs a national insurance
number to work in this country, please
contact the IAC for details on how to
get one of these.
Unfair dismissal – Your employer
must follow a set down procedure be-
fore you get the sack. For example, if
you get sacked and your employer says
it because you can’t do your job prop-
erly, were you given official warnings
before this?
Unions – It is a good idea to join a
trade union even as a student they may
be able to help if there are problems
with your part- time work.
The Information and Advice Centre
can also help with any questions about
your rights you might have.
Final note, part-time work may be a ne-
cessity for you to survive at University
but remember to try to strike a balance
working that amount of hours and bal-
ancing study and a social life!
Also as a part-time worker it is im-
portant that you do not get treated
differently from full time staff, in the
Part-time workers regulations 2000 it
states the following rights for part time
workers:
- The same hourly rate of pay as full
time workers.
- Overtime pay at the same rate if they
have worked full time hours.
- Not to be treated less favourably with
regard to issues such as sickness pay
and maternity leave.
- Have the same access to training as
full time workers
Although part-time work is now a part
of many students life it is important to
not become overworked and to ensure
that your are not ignoring your studies
and taking up hours or a job that starts
to impact on your academic career.
This article is a general guide on Part-
time workers rights, if you feel you
need more detailed advice please do
not hesitate to contact us.
If you look around your lecture thea-
tre, common room or wherever you
happen to be sitting reading this mar-
vellous contraption you will no doubt
see people who are different from you.
They have similar aims and aspira-
tions. They are your (approxi-
mate) intellectual equals.
However, they have all
been brought
by very
dif-
ferent back-
grounds and
experiences to
where they are to-
day. Consequently
their experience of
Imperial will vary
drastically from yours,
from the person sitting
next to them and from
the person writing this
article.
If this is the case how can
one person represent the individ-
ual needs and interests of every per-
son at Imperial? (If someone can an-
swer that question I would be keen to
know…) If there was one person capa-
ble of representing every minority, be
it on issues of race, gender, sexuality or
moral agenda then they would be very
far placed from ‘random student’ and
probably just as hypothetical. If every
person sat near you is so very different
then how will your individual needs
ever be represented?
It is of course impossible to represent
every student individually. Stereotypes
are inescapable in these issues but can
help to make sure that there is a chan-
nel for certain issues to be escalated.
Over the course of the next few weeks
the Representation and Welfare Board,
chaired by the Deputy President (Edu-
cation and Welfare), that’s yours truly,
will be looking to co-opt members to
look
after
and champion
certain issues that will relate to our
members needs. These positions are
known as ‘campaigns portfolios’ and
have been allocated to six specific re-
mits. We are of course open to further
suggestions and by no means is this
meant to be a limiting factor. Each
‘portfolio’ can be allocated to two peo-
ple and one person can hold up to three
portfolios at any time. You don’t have
to be a member of RWB to be allocated
a portfolio and you don’t have to run
in an election. To put it simply, if you
are enthusiastic and think that there
is more that can be done in a specific
area then that is simply enough!
Holding a ‘Campaign Portfolio’
comes with some responsibility. You
might be expected to help people run
campaigns or liaise with certain college
departments or union societies. How-
ever, the Representation and Welfare
Board is there to support all cam-
paign portfolio holders with
time, resources and money
to support their ideas and
develop a stronger feel-
ing of equality across
the campus.
If you are in-
terested in
holding one
of these
posi-
tions
then
please
contact the
Deputy President
(Education and Wel-
fare), email at the top
of the page, who will
give you more information about the
portfolios. There are lots of exciting
projects that you can get involved with
this term and throughout the year and
we already have an excitable team of
Equal Opportunities and Welfare Of-
ficers at your disposal.
The LGBT Campaigns
portfolio:
Imperial has a thriving commu-
nity of LGBT student’s and uni-
versity is recognised as a time
when you are finally free to
express yourself. However, dis-
crimination can still be found on
our campus and we shouldn’t
hide from it. Help people to cel-
ebrate who they are without be-
ing ashamed and take a stand
against homophobic action.
The Anti-racism Campaigns
portfolio:
Get involved in campaigns
against discrimination on the
basis of race, ethnicity and
faith. This term will see a week
long diversity campaign on
RISE: Realise Equality, Cel-
ebrate Diversity and plenty of
other events throughout the
year. You will have opportuni-
ties to liaise with the equality
and diversity group at Imperial
College, the Overseas Societies
Committee and other student
groups across Imperial and the
national student movement.

There are many ethical issues
relevant to students. With our
Ethical policy due for an over-

sibility. There will be plenty of
opportunities to get involved in
Fairtrade promotion as we be-
come a Fairtrade University and

ing is being overlooked and en-
sure that life is not unnecessar-
ily difficult for any student.
