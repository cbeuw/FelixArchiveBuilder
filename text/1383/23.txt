Skirts
A lightweight skirt worn high on
the waist, hitting above the knee is
such a fresh look.
But these are impossible to find
on the high street. Try vintage,
or if you don’t want to smell of
someone else’s stale sweat, make
your own!
Stylemob.com
Rate other people’s outfits and
post your own photo’s to be rated.
Kind of self absorbed, yes. But it
doesn’t make you weep for the
future of humanity in the way that
hotornot.com does.
Possible Agyness Deyn/Topshop
Collaboration
Hopefully Deyn can bring some
fresh creative blood to Topshop,
stemming the flow of derivative
knitwear. That being said, I really
should stop worshiping at the
alter of Deyn.
Jovovich’s face in Resident Evil 3
Her skin was disarmingly perfect.
All I could think of while watch-
ing the film, was how long it must
have taken to photoshop every
frame of her face. It didn’t look like
real skin, and everyone else’s hu-
man skin looked like the surface of
the moon by comparison.
