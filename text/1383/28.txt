How to play:
Using the letters above, not more than
once, make as many words as possible.
They must be at least four or more let-
ters long and each word you come up
with must include the central letter.
Capitalised words, conjugated verbs
(past tense etc), adverbs ending in
“-ly”, comparatives and superlatives are
disallowed.
An example of a word you can’t do
in this particular Polygon is “badger”.
Clearly, this is not possible because
you are missing the letters “b”, “a”, “d”,
“g” and “r”. Note, you have “e”, which
is a start. Maybe you can start a col-
lection because after all, “badger” is a
terrific word.
How to rate yourself:
Under 15 words: Capital “L” for Lame-
ass. Surely you can do better than this.
Loser. Double Loser.
15 – 20 words: Getting better but keep
trying punk. Don’t be getting compla-
cent now though chump.
21 – 25 words: Now you’re hitting the
big league. Keep this up and daddy
may pay for you to go on to do that Sci-
Comm course.
26 or more words: Gadzooks Batman!
Get this guy the author of the English
dictionary, the rest of the world needs
a vocabulary this varied.
