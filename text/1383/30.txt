but as soon as you see the spectacu-
lar sight of the four colossal statues of
Ramses II guarding the temple, there is
little doubt that it is worth every effort.
This may have been a scene that I could
never forget, but it was the surround-
ing desert mountain ranges amongst
a backdrop of the stunning vastness of
Lake Nasser which found it a place in
my heart.
After all of this, what can I say… did
all the exposure to the magnificent his-
torical sights and culture within Egypt
inspire us to continue seeing more of
ancient Egypt? Well, not exactly at that
moment in time. We still had Alexan-
dria to tackle, but we are 21, and we
were definitely ready to hit the beach
before flying back. This doesn’t mean
that we appreciated everything we had
seen any less – but what better way to
think back, reflect on everything and
soak our anguish at having to return to
Imperial, than by dozing our remain-
ing days away by the Red Sea Coast?
What followed next was a journey
to the Sinai Peninsula town of Dahab
(just northeast of Sharm-el-Sheikh),
which could be described as some-
what of a pilgrimage. After waiting 2
hours for a delayed bus, I endured 10
hours of smelly feet and Arabic chant-
ing being blasted directly into my ear
for what was supposed to be a 6 hour
drive– I should have learnt by then
that Egyptian time means having to
add on a few extra hours. Following
that, we hoped to get a few hours sleep
at the St George’s Hotel, described by
our faithful ‘Lonely Planet’ as being
“an ideal place to stay for lone women
travellers”. Translate: “an ideal hangout
for the local Egyptian Peeping Tom”.
Just to summarise – much screaming
ensued at the hotel, and we ended up
sleeping with the cupboard against our
door. My advice: Don’t stay at the St
George’s Hotel. Next up was a boat trip
to the Sharm-El-Sheikh–it appeared
that the boat was doing its best to com-
pete with the Pirates of the Caribbean
ride. An hour later, and we had finally
arrived.
Dahab was the ultimate way to spend
the last few days in Egypt. The snor-
kelling and diving was a worthy rival
to that of the Gulf of Thailand, where
I had been just a month earlier. Add in
the mouth-watering food you receive
in small tavernous restaurants over-
looking the sea, where the owners are
happy for you to nap for hours on cush-
ions whilst relaxing and friendly locals
who generously provide you with free
shisha every night, as well as many-a –
happy Western hippy giving the town
its characteristic laid-back feel, and I
really couldn’t have asked for a better
place to unwind.
Sadly, terrorists ripped apart the
idyllic tranquil of this town in 2006
when a bomb exploded killing several
people. Although quiet, it was visible
to see that the town was beginning to
thrive again. Egypt has suffered a ter-
rible blow to its tourism since terrorist
attacks in the 90’s but it appears that it
is impossible for people to keep away
from the never-ending delights of a
country with so many iconic sights
bound in ancient culture, which still
maintains its powerful mysticism and
hold over the world to this day.
