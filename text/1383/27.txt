Virgo
So, two down, but
I’ve run out of ideas
now that I’ve spent
the ideas that I had
stored in the Horo-
scopes databank
that is my vast mind. Perhaps I should talk
Shakespeare and bring some sophistication to
an otherwise dreary and nonsensical section
of the newspaper. Billy S... Ah. We love a bit of
good old Willy. Badoom-tish.
Scorpio
I know what you’re
thinking. Did he
fire six shots or only
five? Well, to tell
you the truth, in all
this excitement, I’ve
kinda lost track myself. But being as this is a
.44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in
the world, and would blow your head clean off,
you’ve got to ask yourself one question: Do I
feel lucky? Well, do ya punk?
Libra
This week you sail
the Andes, unfor-
tunately for you,
you’re on the wrong
continent without
a crampon. You
moron. What kind of fucking idiot gets the
Andes and the Ganges mixed up? Jesus. One’s
a mountain range, one’s wetter than a blind-
folded lesbian in a fishmongers...
... What?
Sagittarius
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
LUKE. HAPPY

PY BIRTHDAY LUKE. HAPPY BIRTHDAY

Capricorn
This week you
rediscover the art
of making games
out of seemingly
nothing, just like
you did when you
were six years old. Suddenly, the sofa becomes
a grind rail and occupies you for hours. The
Turkish rug becomes a football pitch for your
Warhammer figurines and pavement cracks
become laser trip wires. Happy days.
Cancer
You love your team.
They’re great. They
produce wonderful
articles for you each
week which results
in a newspaper that
you think’s pretty good, if you do say so your-
self. Of course, you have your favourites too,
but that would be telling. You’re just one, big
happy family and they’re all suckling from the
luscious bounty of your swollen bosom.
Gemini
A recipe for
chocolate body
paint (as produced
by Ed Henley,
Science Editor
extraordinaire. Yep,
that’s right – the guy continuing his brown
theme from the Aries box). Step 1: Melt down
and combine equal quantities of cream and
chocolate. Step 2: Get your birthday suit on,
lather yourself up and get hellalickup.
Leo
This week you enroll
in the ICWF, that’s
Imperial College
Wrestling Federa-
tion. You size up to
Killer P Jackman,
but you’re no match for his muscular prowess.
Oh god, I made a joke about College staff. I’m
decaying. From the inside outwards. Please, if
you care for my sanity, ring 0845 9111 000 and
donate generously. Thank you for your time.
Taurus
This week you
notice that your
zodiac symbol looks
like a space hopper.
This is a sign. You
want to go buy one.
However, you don’t have enough money. You
decide to cut out the space hopper from Felix
and try to straddle it in the lecture theatre.
Somehow you fit magically onto it and bounce
off into the outermost cosmos. BOING.
Aries
This week your
Science Editor
reveals another side
to his personality
that you were not
quite aware of. He
informs you that he is a member of the Poo
People Group. Officially, that means they’re
coprafillicas or something. I don’t really know
what that means or how to spell it, but it
sounds a bit gross. Euewww.
Pisces
This week you
have an unpleasant
experience that you
might actually find
described in the
Horoscopes section.
45 minutes into your sleep you wake itching.
You rub Savlon into your body and upon
returning to your bed, you discover a wasp
underneath your duvet. It had stung you three
times whilst you slept. 6 BOOKS. SPLAT. DIE.

Wordoku is identical to sudoku;
we’ve just replaced the numbers
with letters. Once you’ve
completed the puzzle, there
is a hidden word or phrase to
find. Email in your answers to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.
The winner of the broken
Wordoku 1,382 was Heather
Jackson. The hidden phrase
was “BITCHSLAP”.

Aquarius
Last week you
publish something
you didn’t read.
This isn’t a rare
occurrence, just
that last week it
mattered. Well sort of. We seemed to have
avoided anything that might have rocked
the apple cart. What the hell? Hold on.
Apple cart? What the... Who came up with
that phrase? WHERE DID I LEARN IT?
How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar
to Minesweeper mixed with a dash of
Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw
lines between the dots to create one
long, and most importantly, looping
line. It should have no start or finish;
just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many
lines should be drawn around it, for
example:
Cells which don’t contain a number
can be surrounded by any number of
lines.
Remember, the line must form a
loop, so the line cannot branch. The
following situations are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There
are never cells containing the number
4 in Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most
common place to start on a Slitherlink
grid is by drawing crosses around any
zeros. Drawing crosses is purely done
to so that you know where there can’t
possibly be a line. So, take the pattern
below as an example. Begin by drawing
crosses, then by filling in some lines:
Now the lines can only continue in the
following directions:
The Slitherlinks on this page are basic
5x5 grids. Get practising because you
can expect some 10x10s later in the
term and perhaps even some severe
25x30 grids when we’re feeling really
mean. Email us to let us know how you
got on with these ones.
This final paragraph is a tricky one.
There are four lines that need to be
filled. Will I remember to do it each
week, or will we ditch it eventually?
