On Friday 21st June, 6 members of
Imperial College Outdoor Club de-
parted London to clear the years learn-
ing from their heads. The destination
was Ailefroide, Parc des Ecrins, in the
French Alps.
Twenty four hours later the team
arrived at the campsite in Ailefroide
keen to stretch their legs, so a quick
foray was made up the Tete de la Draye
(2077m). We returned to the camp-
site to share a flagon of red wine with
climbers we had met from King’s Col-
lege. They had already been climbing
there for two weeks, so we used the op-
portunity to get first hand information
about the conditions in the area.
It was decided that we would trek
up to the Glacier Blanc and climb the
peaks surrounding it. The necessary
food and fuel for four days was bought
and packed and everything was near-
ly ready. For many of the team it was
their first trip climbing the Alps in al-
pine style, and the skills required for
safe glacier travel had to be learnt on
the campsite. A couple of hours were
spent perfecting the art of self rescue
and assisted rescue from crevasses
(the fractures found in the surface of
glaciers). This was a bewildering sight
for the other occupants of the camp-
site but it meant that everyone was
equipped with the vital skills required
for glacier travel.
In order to help the team to acclima-
tise, a night was spent camping halfway
(vertically) to the glacier at approxi-
mately 2500m before heading onwards
from that camp in the early hours of
the morning. It is safer to travel at this
time because any snow that melted the
previous day will have refrozen over-
night, making it much easier and safer
to walk on.
The team made it to base camp
bright and early and spent the morn-
ing preparing the camp and building
a wall of ice blocks as a windbreak –
not an easy task at altitude – and get-
ting ready for the day ahead. The first
climb was up the Pic de Neige Cordier
(3614m), which was non-technical, but
assisted with acclimatisation. The gen-
erally held view is that the best way to
acclimatise is to climb high but to sleep
low so the body can recover. For this
reason we usually spent the afternoons
relaxing in the sun, preparing for the
next day, or sleeping.
At 2am the following morning we
made an attempt on the Pic du Glacier
Blanc (3525m). This peak was a differ-
ent style to the first peak, as after reach-
ing the base of the climb over snow, the
rest was a rock climb. Halfway up the
route, after evaluating the risk of con-
tinuing, a decision was made to retreat.
The team had lost time at the start of
the day because we had significantly
increased the length of the climb by
starting it much lower down the ridge.
After descending to the campsite for
some thicker air and more food, the
weather on the summits turned and so
we were forced to stay in the valley for
a few days. To make the most of this
time the team spent a few days sport
climbing in the valley, and another try-
ing a style of climbing not found (until
this year) in the UK.
Via Ferrata or “the way of iron” is a
style of climbing where all the protec-
tion and holds are fixed to the rock
face. It was designed to enable soldiers
to cross mountains quickly and safely
with little training during the Second
World War. As the name suggests the
route is made of iron staples driven
deep into the rock to be used as hand-
holds and footholds, as well as a cables
alongside for protection.
When the weather improved we re-
turned to the glacier and completed the
final alpine climb of the trip, the Dome
de Neige (4015m), with the intention
of climbing Barres des Ecrins (4102m)
from there. Unfortunately the weather
came in again while we were on the
summit of the Dome de Neige, making
proceeding up to the Barres des Ecrins
Outdoor club goes outdoors
“To put yourself into a situation where a mistake cannot
necessarily be recouped, where the life you lose may be your
own, clears the head wonderfully.” – Al Alvarez, Mountaineer
impossible. Once again the team de-
scended and spent a couple of days
climbing on some of the many sport
climbing crags around Ailefroide.
With ‘wonderfully clear heads’ the
team packed the bus for the long jour-
ney home, snuck in a few last climbs,
and set off for London.
Members of the Outdoor Club often
organise their own trips and expedi-
tions to areas all over the world. This
year alone has involved trips to Scot-
land, Svalbard, Chamonix, Mt Blanc
and Pakistan amongst others.
The Outdoor Club is a great oppor-
tunity to have a go at any of these activ-
ities and we cater for all abilities, from
the complete novice to extreme alpi-
nists. We organise trips every fortnight
during the term, to North Wales, the
Lake District and other regions of the
UK. Tours are run at the end of each
Neil Dowse
term. This winter we will be climbing
snow and ice in the Cairngorms, at
Easter we will be scrambling on the Isle
of Skye, and summer tour next year
will be somewhere in the Alps.
If you fancy an introduction to climb-
ing closer to home, we climb indoors
at the Westway Sports Centre every
Wednesday - just come to Beit Quad
at 1pm. You can meet members of the
club at one of these sessions or during
our regular meetings every Tuesday at
1230 in dBs.
Membership is only £14 and all lev-
els of experience are welcome, you can
learn all the skills you need for the tour
like the one above during the weekend
trips.
