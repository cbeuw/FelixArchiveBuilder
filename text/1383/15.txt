Poetic Respite of the Week from John Keats
Straight in at the deep end with Romanticism. An extremely potent poem and any man who has been
mercilessly intoxicated by a woman and left feeling like crap the morning after will empathise with John
Ah, what can ail thee, knight-at-
arms,
Alone and palely loitering;
The sedge is wither’d from the lake,
And no birds sing.
Ah, what can ail thee, wretched
wight,
So haggard and so woe-begone?
The squirrel’s granary is full,
And the harvest’s done.
I see a lily on thy brow,
With anguish moist and fever dew;
And on thy cheek a fading rose
Fast withereth too.
I met a lady in the meads
Full beautiful, a faery’s child;
Her hair was long, her foot was
light,
And her eyes were wild.
I set her on my pacing steed,
And nothing else saw all day long;
For sideways would she lean, and
sing
A faery’s song.
I made a garland for her head,
And bracelets too, and fragrant
zone;
She look’d at me as she did love,
And made sweet moan.
She found me roots of relish sweet,
And honey wild, and manna dew;
And sure in language strange she
said,
I love thee true.
She took me to her elfin grot,
And there she gaz’d and sighed
deep,
And there I shut her wild sad eyes--
So kiss’d to sleep.
And there we slumber’d on the
moss,
And there I dream’d, ah woe
betide,
The latest dream I ever dream’d
On the cold hill side.
I saw pale kings, and princes too,
Pale warriors, death-pale were they
all;
Who cry’d--”La belle Dame sans
merci
Hath thee in thrall!”
I saw their starv’d lips in the gloam
With horrid warning gaped wide,
And I awoke, and found me here
On the cold hill side.
And this is why I sojourn here
Alone and palely loitering,
Though the sedge is wither’d from
the lake,
And no birds sing.
J
ohn Keats, in the same year that
he wrote La Belle Dame Sans
Merci, remarked to his brother
George that “The great beauty
of poetry is that it makes eve-
rything and every place interesting.”
Keats published three poetry books
in his lifetime, but it was only after his
very short life that he gained the fame
he clearly deserved. Often accused of
being “a middle-class interloper”, Keats
in fact suffered for much of his early
life. He lost both parents as well as a
brother to tuberculosis and another
to America. Poverty hindered him in
finding true love and in education too.
Keats carried out his schooling up the
road in Enfield and later enrolled at
Guy’s hospital- a poet and a scientist-
to study anatomy, botany, dissection
and physiology among other things,
with the intention to join the Royal
College of Surgeons. However, Keats
dropped out of medicine to pursue his
devotion to poetry. In the last years of
his life, he suffered several bouts of ill-
ness and depression and was nursed by
his fiancé-to-be Fanny Brawne. Within
one year of their engagement Keats
died in Rome 1821.
“Kiss me quick you sexy, iron-clad knight-at-arms!”
This week Dr Picasso Jones examines Tom? by Jack E. Cronin
Student Art in Focus
T
his week in our little cor-
ner of showcasing student
talent, we have one sketch
by the experimental art-
ist Jack E. Cronin. ‘Tom?’
is part of an extensive collection of
small sketches. Other pieces include
the acclaimed ‘Tom’s Mum’ and ‘Welsh
Landscape (with sheep being loved in
foreground by Tom)’.
JackECroninhaslongbeenanentre-
preneur of new materials and methods
for creating his distinctive style and
has been away for some time work-
ing with his new media, permanent
marker and post-it note – both very
effective as we can clearly see.
‘Tom?’ is clearly a character
of many layers. Although simple
looking on the outside, there is
more to him than meets the eye.
Likewise, the allium genus of
the Plantae kingdom, which in-
cludes such popular vegetables
as the onion and leek, whilst
dirty on the outside, conceals be-
low the surface layers of nutrition-
al beauty. Perhaps the artist means
to imply that he would like to fry
‘Tom’ in butter and make a nice cas-
serole with him, just like one would
with an onion. Or make Leek and
Potato soup.
The shape of the head could possibly
represent the humble science student,
being conical flask shaped and thus
easily filled with knowledge, beer or
other chemical substances.
In the portrait the jaw and
mouth are very much more prom-
inent than the forehead, which of
course conceals the brain. This is
representative of a major flaw in hu-
man nature, in that we often speak
before we think, for example, hav-
ing a conversation with a volleyball
without realising its inanimacy. Jack E
Cronin will be selling select pieces of
this particular collection at Sotheby’s
at the end of the month and he expects
to make at least 12 pence.
