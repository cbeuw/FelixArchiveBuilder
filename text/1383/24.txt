Tony Blair is like a plate of spaghetti
In 1999, Iain Duncan Smith spoke,
“According to Labour’s own maga-
zine, ‘Tony’s favourite food is
fish and chips. He
gets a takeaway
whenever he is
at home in his
constituency.’
“But when
The Islington
Cook Book
asked him the
same ques-
tion he said
his favorite
food was ‘fresh

A quick reminder that you are what you eat followed by more recipes than you can shake a sausage at
This is perfect student food for
the upcoming winter months.
It’s tasty, warming and filling
all at the same time. Feel free
to serve it with ordinary gravy
made from granules but noth-
ing beats onion gravy. Dish it
up with a healthy portion of
whatever vegetable you fancy-
carrots, peas or broccoli are
perfect.
You’ll need:
Sausages (as many as you
like)
3 potatoes per person
salt and pepper to taste
a knob of butter
a splash of milk
For the onion gravy:
1 onion (small for one person,
large for three)
gravy granules
a drizzle of olive or vegetable
oil
a sprinkle of sugar
1 tbsp balsamic vinegar
(optional)
Instructions
1. Start cooking the sausages
as per the cooking instruc-
tions. I prefer cooking them in
the oven because they need
less attention than ones fry-
ing in a pan. This should take
This isn’t nearly as terrifying
as people think. It just requires
a little bit of attention which
can be divided between the
TV, a magazine or a special
someone….
Feel free to use any soft veg-
etable that you like instead of
mushrooms, or even cooked
meat. Try courgettes, peppers,
peas, prawns or cooked chick-
en, chorizo, etc. Just add them
at the same stage you would
add the mushrooms.
You’ll need:
1 small onion (or ½ a large on-
ion) chopped
a handful of mushrooms,
roughly chopped
1 stock cube (vegetable or
chicken)
1 cup of risotto rice
a big knob of butter
a sprig of fresh thyme
(optional)
small glass of white wine (op-
tional) and lastly
salt and pepper to taste
Instructions
1. Melt the knob of butter in a
saucepan and add the chopped
onion. Cook until soft- this will
take about 10 minutes. Add the
mushrooms and stir.
2. Add the risotto rice and stir
until coated with the butter.
Carry on stirring for a few minutes
until the rice starts to go translu-
cent. Add the salt and pepper and
thyme, if using.
3. Make up half a pint of stock by
adding boiled water to the stock
cube. If using wine splash it into
the pan at this point and wait until it
evaporates. If not, just add an extra
cup of water to the stock and pour
a glass of this into the pan instead,
again waiting for it to evaporate.
4. Keep adding the stock a splash
at a time, stirring until it evaporates
and then adding some more.
This should take about 20 min-
utes, depending on the instruc-
tions on the pack of risotto rice.
If the stock is finished before the
rice has cooked just top it up with
some hot water instead.
5. The rice is cooked when it
has just a slight bite and it is just
starting to go sticky around the
edges. Don’t overcook it or it will
turn into porridge. Serve with
shavings of parmesan if you like
it and the leftover wine.
Mushroom Risotto
Bangers and mash
about 20-30 minutes.
2. In the meantime, peel and
chop the potatoes into pieces and
boil for 20 minutes, until cooked
through. A sharp knife should
go straight through without any
resistance at the end.
3. While the sausages and pota-
toes are cooking you can make
your onion gravy. Slice the onion
in half and then cut it into thin
slices. Heat a drizzle of oil in a
frying pan and ccok the onions
slowly until they soften but are
not brown. This will take about
10-15 minutes. Sprinkle over some
sugar.
4. When the onions have cooked
through, make up about a quarter
of a pint of gravy for each person
using granules and boiling water.
Make it slightly runnier than you
would like it because it will thicken
up. Pour over the onions and
splash in the balsamic vinegar if
using (the cheap stuff is fine). Stir
until it thickens.
5. Cook your vegetable in some
salted boiling water- carrots take
about 6 minutes, broccoli 3, peas
2.
6. Drain the potatoes and add
the butter, salt and pepper and
milk and mash until there are no
lumps. Serve with the sausages
and vegetables and a generous
amount of gravy.
Looks yuck, tastes yum
Here’s a simple recipe to give
your spaghetti dishes that little
extra something.
Remember, this recipe con-
tains milk.
1 Finely chop some onions
and celery, and fry in olive oil
until translucent, not brown.
2 Add some chopped car-
rots, stirring well to coat
everything.
3 Add your mince (beef plus
optional pork) and a good pinch
of salt to draw out the fat.
4 Cook until it has lost its raw
colour. Twist in some pepper.
5 Here’s where it gets left-
field… Add some whole
milk! Enough to almost cover
the mince. Bubble it mer-
rily until most of the liquid has
evaporated.
6 Now even more surprising,
add some white wine! Same
amount as above, and again
bubble until gone.
7 Empty in a few cans of
tinned chopped tomatoes.
8 Simmer for AT LEAST one
hour, adding water if it gets too
dry.
9 Important to taste for salt at
the end.
Recipe adapted from a defini-
tive book by Marcella Hazan:
The Essentials of Classic Ital-
ian Cooking.
Cook your own pub grub
garnished with an exotic sauce of olive
oil, sun-dried tomatoes and capers’.”
So you see, food matters because it
says something about you. Gordon
Brown’s favourite food is probably oat-
cakes. David Cameron probably cares
about food miles and the plight of the
British farmer.
Anyway in 2006 it was further re-
vealed that Tony’s favourite food to
cook was spaghetti bolognese, and I
couldn’t agree more. This recipe takes
a brilliant cauldron approach, as the
milk phase bubbles into the white wine
phase, and the all-important lengthy
simmer utterly transforms a liquid with
bits floating around into an unctuous
and soft, almost homogeneous sauce.
Many a heinous sinner has abused a
Bolognese recipe by simply not sim-
mering for long enough.
Note that it contains no secret magic
additives, and demonstrates brilliantly
that technique is far more important
than ingredients. In fact, a good chef
can knock up something special from
any old bag of oddities, hence the
wonder of Ready Steady Cook. I find
it extremely satisfying to make the
best Bolognese ever from just a few
standard ingredients, and no fiddly
little ones. I’m not giving quanti-
ties as I never use them and it builds
confidence to guess.
