Living the hedge fund intern dream
- 0600 – Dammit, time to wake up!
- 0631 – Get in (almost at the right
time for once...)
- 0635 – Talk to CIO about the over-
night. Try to seem clever and blurt
out that no one should be long gamma
right now – get snickered at. Other in-
terns look confused.
- 0700 – Feel dejected after being called
arrogant (again), even if it was a joke
- 0730 – After some sulking and a
quick read of the latest news, start do-
ing some real work
- 0731 – Hacking away on model to
trade an index on price action almost
exclusively
- 0737 – Get up to get some coffee
- 0800 – Battling Excel’s unintuitive
ways
- 0844 – Was that the hot secretary?
Didn’t even notice her coming in..
what’s happening to me?
- 1015 – Change the CD on the floor ...
Damn Callas is getting on my nerves.
Would like to see her building my
model and see if it was something to
sing about
- 1215 – Look up at big picture on
Bloomberg .. No one cares about the
Bovespa, why is it even on there?
- 1252 – More grunting is going on.
Excel is not helping. Stupid Bloomberg
API. Darn, I’m hungry.
- 1254 – Chick intern complains she’s
hungry. I tell chick intern ‘lunch is for
wimps’. Damn, I’m hungry, but now
can’t even say anything.
- 1309 – Swallow pride and confess
hunger. Chick intern smirks – I feel like
bitchslapping her. Grab a sandwich, eat
it at desk. Still feel empty.. I wish I had
some tiramisu.. perhaps a steak?
- 1319 – More coffee
A man simply known as Fields documents his day including the CIO, hot chicks and the morbidly obese
- 1322 – Wow, Facebook is not blocked.
Feel too guilty to be on it, even at
‘lunch’. Log off
- 1325 – Excel is grinning at me, saying
‘Come to papa’. Papa goes to Excel...
- 1433 – Why is it so hot, and why is it
that I’m having trouble nesting a sim-
ple IF function?
- 1525 – CIO opens a nice position...
leveraged 600%. Looks at ticker for 25
seconds, retreats back to desk without
a word... Feel a bit puzzled
- 1550 – “Get ready, you’re meeting my
biggest client” says the almighty
- 1600 – He really is big, humoungous
even, morbidly obese. Probably needs
a gastric bypass. Very plump red face,
very bald, very hot assistant
- 1602 – “You look young, how old are
you, 17?”. I think “Does a 17 yo have
more hair on his chest than you do on
your head?”; I actually say “No sir, I’m a
few years older. 21 is a good age”..
- 1603 – The guy wants to know what
the CIO will do if he gives him more
money. CIO is a rock and gives him a
general gist, failing to provide a single
tangible piece of information. What a
hardass.. I like it.
- 1635 – The whale exits having left a
commitment for a nice wad of cash
- 1636 – CIO doesn’t show it, but I
bet he feels smug, like a Big Fucking
Swinging Dick
- 1751 – Chick intern talks as she
chews gum. I tell her she’s getting on
my nerves. She looks away. HOW IS
THAT OFFENSIVE?!
- 1820 – Model is finally making some
sense, after fixing circularity error.
Write “T-1” on post-it. Stick on com-
puter. Will probably get unstuck over-
night and I’ll use “T” next day again..
- 1850 – CIO gets up – talks about dis-
cipline. Am thinking I’ve read this all
before.. He says “I’m sure you’re think-
ing you’ve read all this before, but I’ll
still engrave it on your mind – I wiped
out a sizable portion of my gains for
the year in two days because I thought
I was better than the markets and
didn’t respect my own rules. Market
rallied the day after I cut my losses...
I still don’t regret respecting my stop,
although it feels like shit”
- 1902 – Speech over, rather inspiring
seeing him so calm after talking about
such a massive loss. Collected, non-
chalant, humble. There’s something to
be said about the balance between hu-
bris, self-knowledge and humility.
- 1934 – Looking at my screens, lean
back on my chair, and thinking I’d do
this until 3am if needed.
- 1950 – Told to go home in 10 mins.
Got off early for once.. Sun is still up.
Brilliant!
- 2003 – Am out. Sit down in front of
the sea. Look at the sky... never knew
there could be so many hues. Tomor-
row’s all about green and red again...
Intensity. Wealth. Drive. Buzzwords
“CIO opens a
nice position...
leveraged 600%.
Looks at ticker
for 25 seconds,
retreats back to
desk without a
word... Feel a bit
puzzled”
Ah, the working environment and haven for hedge fund interns. We’ll
have no mention of sardines in a tin in this picture caption, oh no
