UNFAIR
Dear Sir,
Having waited myself for about
5 minutes, and s t i l l only half way
along the queue in the Lower Refectory
on Saturday lunchtime (January 17th),
I was astonished to observe a group of
Administration Staff and their guests
walk into the Refectory and immediately
sit down at a reserved tabl*. To my
further amazement, their meals were then
served to them by the already overworked
refeotory staff.
Since reserved tables have not
been allowed, and rightly so, i n the
Refeotory, may we know whether this i s
a change of policy on the part of the
Refeotory Casmittee, and why they did
not first seek the advice of the Presi-
dent of the Union.
Tours faithfully,
P.K. Richardson.
BASEOVERAPEX
Dear Sir,
Why was «y inside upsidadown?
that is, the inside of my Felix.
This unfortunate state of affairs
necessitated my reading the inner
pages inverted, i.e. upon my head.
The result of this manoeuvre
being, that the outside was then the
wrong way up. An interesting Top-
ological problem, but most inconvenient.
hay I suggest you try selling
inside out, upside down P e l — s to
the Australians.
Tours giddily,
J.E.C.
Maths I.
KD. The Editor wishes to apologise
for any unseemly contortions necessit-
ated by the last issue - there were,
admittedly, some unfortunate printing
mishaps. Special back to front,
pullout and throw away Tibetan supple-
ment next issue.
CRITICISM
Sir,
It seems that today we have the
ohoioe of either a self-advertisement
produced on glossy paper by the
fascist minority, or the illiterate
tripe that you provide. Ton should
know that Quinness i s spelt with two
Ex-Editor.
XD. We are starting a campaign for
soonamy in spelling. Guinness,
tennis and Dennis were a l l spelt with
one "n" last issue. Any innconnvenn-
iennoes regretted.
LANGUAGE
Dear Sir,
Three years ago I was under the im-
pression that on entering college I
would be* mixing with the cream of
British youth, intelligent, educated
and good mannered. But this was a
false impression. I.C. students have
proved to be the most i l l mannered
louts I have yet come across, using
filthy obscene language with no regard
as to who is present. It is not
clever to be able to swear, to be ob-
scene or to be down right rude even
less so when young ladies are present,
I am ashamed to introduce people to
the College. How much longer i s this
disgusting behaviour to continue?
Yours hopefully,
Bruce Cozens.
ART FOR SCIENTISTS
Dear Sir,
A lot has been said about the
advantages of incorporating the Royal
College of Art into I.C. The I.C. Art
Club has started a movement to bring
these advantages within reach by ask-
ing a few art students to come to I.C.
cn February the 5th at 12.35 p.m. The
tutor in aesthetic design in engineering
will t e l l us about the psychological
aspects of his subject. The meeting
will continue over lunch in smaller
groups so that students may intermingle.
After lunch the form of this "new"
Club will be decided within the pre-
conception of friendship and informal
meeting between "scientist" and "art-
ist".
The Royal College of Art are just
as keen to meet the "soientist" as we
are of meeting the "artist", and believe
i t or not, they are suffering from the
same troubles of specialisation as we
Yours sincerely,
Michael Young

1. A prize, to be deoided later, i s
to be awarded by Felix to the first
person to write in the
dust on Ken Weale1
s new oar.
2. I t is rumoured that Peter Kassler
has sold the T.V. rights of the R.C.S.
Building to the organisers of ijuater-
mass (B.B.C. T.V. Mondays), as a last
attempt to get R.C.S. over to the
people.
3. It has been suggested that the
editor of Felix should follow the example
of the editor of Phoenix and take a long
holiday abroad. Any suggestions?
V. Have we a f-xth oolumn at work?
The Bar was very nearly flooded the
other Saturday evening. Is this an
attempt by I . C . W . a . to take over our
last remaining sanctuary?
5. Following the rumour that Mrs.
Robb. in the Union Office was to ad-
minister the polio injections,it i s
not surprising that Tilly was the only
Union Officer to subject herself to the
inoculations.
6. Have you tried i t yet? Any
evening after 10.30 in the right atmos-
phere; the Ennismore Arms is now open
to I . C .
7. Dan Fowler (ex-R.S.M.) is now
working as a furniture remover.
Industry offers excellent opportunities
to graduates]
8. Nelson welcomes Richard Garnett's
donations of free Coca Cola in the
Snack Bar on Tuesday afternoons, but
feels that beer would be a greater
attraction. The I . C . President
appears to be doing a tour of his con-
stituencies. Nelson observed him at
the last Guilds Union Meeting wearing
his oldest pair of trousers.
9. Since the removal of Helgi Ulk's
birthday present over the Xmas vac.
(an 18-ins. square block of stone), she
has asked for the aid of a l l Felix rea-
ders in procuring an even larger,
heavier, and better piece of rock.
All contributions gratefully received
on the 3rd. floor of the New Hostel.
10. Nelson i s enjoying the improved
bitter in the I.C. Bar and welcomes
the temporary return of Ted Smith.
11. Following a recent Profile i n
Sennet (Jan. 13th), Nelson has received
this short poem.
Tough is his skin - like a rhino.
Leaden his sleep - as a log.
Stomach walls made out of lino
And hairy his back - like a hog.
12. Although the l i f t in the Union
is powerfully constructed, there are
limits - Nelson hears that the makers
have asked Little Richard to limits
his parties to eight i n future.
13. Nelson does not wish i t to be
known that ICWA are selecting a Mr. ICWA
of 1959, because this information i s
highly secret. Anyone on the f i r s t two
floors make good ooffae?
