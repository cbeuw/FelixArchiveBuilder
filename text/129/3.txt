AN APPRAISAL.
The Quatermass serial which has
been responsible for f i l l i n g the Tele-
vision Room in the Union with unfailing
regularity, i s more than just an expert
essay in the realms of soienoe fiction.
Technically, of course, i t can be
appreciated on several levels. Stop
cameraman 'Englanders' film inserts at
almost any point and an exhibition
print could be made; listen to the
music and i t i s as effeotive, in i t s am
field, as the story itself.
But i t is not even the action
/hioh gives Quateraass i t s appeal both
to scientific and l a y - B i n d s . It i s
•possibility". The g r i m elements of
the story are possible, only Just i s i t
i s true, but that is sufficient.
Indeed, reality caught up with Quatar-
a a s s the man early on, the first serial
is now technically (and sensationally)
out of date.
Nigel Kneale, who has written a l l
the grim episodes has found the weak
point of society today. It is a feel-
in insecurity in the scientific world
which is rapidly developing. Too
often scientists themselves speak and
act as i f they had God's ear a l l to
themselves. They don't and the man in
the street knows i t , and i s frightened.
If the scientists can tackle so much
that i s frightful, how much mare dread-
ful and unlocked for mast the final hor-
ror that may destroy the world be.
This is where the essential hum-
anity of Prof. Quatermass is apparent.
He is almost a scientist on the out-
side - he too, must fight his way through
the petty officialdom and smog security
of men who have power - and believe
that that is everything. Viewers feel
that Quatermass i s on their side, and
oan even identify themselves with him,
in the fervent hope that when the final
shadow does f a l l across society, a
•an like Quatermass will be there.
225-150: Professional bachelor, rake,
Casanova eto - doomed to be lonely old
age i f he doesn't watah out. Likes
his liquor straight, his oars and
women fast. Not to be trusted.
Dynamite to the weaker of the weaker
sex - well left alone..
I5O-5O: Dangerous; unbeatably att-
ractive, unbelievably intelligent,
unutterably charming, a l l male - so
he tells you. Also unbearably
conceited. Improves with old age.
specially i f left i n cold storage.
0 and neighbourhood: The golden
mean. No more need be saidl
-50 205: Completely domesticated,
will not cause any trouble. No
worry about a wolf in sheep's clothing
here.

CLEOPATRA'S NEEDLE
A new sport seems to have taken
root among the male population of
I.C. lately - that of putting members
of I.C.W.A. through question..aires and
ratings. This may seem to be an
amusing game on the surface, but ladies
of I.C.W.A., i t is a deliberate cam-
paign calculated to provide a handy
guide to the personalities, characters
of t i n unsuspecting Iowarians.
We of Cleopatras Needle see the
danger in this. In order to retaliate
in seme measure we have compiled the
"WALEOLK rating" to help a girl to
separate the wolf from the sheep, and
to make an accurate assessment of any
man.
The soore opposite each question
applies to the positive answer, i.e.
"yes". No marks are given for an ans-
wer in the negative.
