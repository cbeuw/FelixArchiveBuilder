SIG RIDES AGAIN
Some of you wi^J. have noticed that,
in the last issue, I was noticeable
by my absence - this was due to the
Editor (curse him!) who has been
described as the man to "clean up
Felix". Those of you who are aquaim*
ted with the character in question will
know the futility of this paradox.
However, there has been such an out-
cry against the suppression of my •alums
that he has been forced to allow mm xo
write again, with conditions, however;
from now on all my work mu3t be elevat-
ing. To oomply with this I am writing
this column in the Union l i f t - i t
seems crazy, but who am I?
For ay first elevating lecture,
patients, I am about to hold forth on
"The Origins of Culture".
Culture begins with the Greeks,
of course - a most fortunate coinci-
dence for, since they are very old,
culture has been around some time.
As we are taught i n this College, any-
thing old is worth keeping, e.g.,
cheese, wine, the Prof., and so forth.
Despite this, i t is unfortunate that the
Greeks appeared early in the history of
spelling and they made so many mistakes.
A fixation on the letter "p" has led to
many confusing and psilly mistakes;
scientists welcome this, of oourse, as
i t makes their work unintelligible when
used properly. This is a very pstulpid
pnotion, in my opinion.
The most important invention of
the Greeks was the word. When other
civilisations eventually found out the
virtues of Ancient Greece - how i t made
their lamps burn brighter, and so on,
they notioed that whatever the situa-
tion-"The Greeks had a word for i t " .
It was soon found that this word was of
universal application, in fact the only
drawback was its unprintability. The
word oan be obtained, written or spoken,
by application to the Felix Office -
I.C.W.A. not included. A modern
version of the word is of oourse, the
message, which i t seems Private Presley
has got.
Another famous, and well-used
Greek invention is the following Joke:-
"What' s a Grecian Um?"
"About 30 drachmae a week."
SWOTTING
by Ann'4Jargret Radford
Through these notes forever wading,
How my memory is fading!
Did I really write so much
Most of i t seems Double Dutoh!
Her* i s something I remember
We did i t sometime in November.
This I'm sure I didn't write
Here it's surely "length" not "height".
Is i t really worth this worry?
(Don't answer that - just learn - and
hurry!)
For these exams Just must be passed,
(Pray that the next lot are the last),
If in the end you want to be
A.R.C.S. and B.Sc
It was this that caused Arry
Stephanas to use that word.
A very sporting nation, the Greeks
spent much of their time playing marbles
- a set of these, the Elgin Marbles,
said to have been used by Socrates,
can be seen in the British Museum.
These famous marble games were started
on Friday, B.C. 1230, when Olympia was
opened for the first Olympic Games.
We are indeed fortunate to have this
example of classical architecture near
cur College. May I hope that you view
this great edifice with renewed interest.
When we pass to the Romans we find
a decadent peoples, with a long history
of labour disputes - summed up in their
own proverb - "Rome was not built in
a day". Despite this, the Romans were
keen biologists and investigated the
diet of the larger mammals. One of
these investigations is a classic;
Oplus Claudius, "On the dietary effects
of feeding lions on various Christians,
prisoners &c." - Proc. Ron. Soo. Exp.
Sc. Vol. XXX.WC, Recent attempts to
repeat this experiment in the basements
of the Zoology Dpet. have met with
opposition, mainly from the Miners who
had been chosen as suitable substitutes
for the ".. prisoners, etc.". This
is ironic justice, for since the time
of the Romans, knowledge has been
persecuted.
As a fully qualified idiot, I
would like to pay tribute to an ever-
to-be-forgotten Spaniard, Don Spit
(penalty £5) who boldly told the Inquis-
ition that the world was round and
nothing that they could do would con-
vince him otherwise- To prove this, he
set sail due East one Wednesday and
three months later, f e l l off the edge.
Which only goes to prove that there is
one barn every minute.
"One what"?
"I'm not 3ure, but i t means
that there are four more in the world
since you started reading this - move
over a bit, oan't you, it3 getting
crowded.
And i f some of you ask me, "where
do the Chinese come into the history
of culture"? the answer is, of oourse,
through chinks in the floorboards.
