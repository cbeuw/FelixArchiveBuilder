ONE ANSWER
VIEWPOINT
Recent opinions, expressed both
verbally and i n p r i n t , suggest that the
contents of the l a s t Phoenix were neither
representative of the Union nor i n the
Union's l i t e r a r y taste. I t i s , how-
ever acknowledged that the present
Editor has raised the standard of the
magazine technically . The present-
ation i s excellent: advertisements
have been won. We have gained on
the roundabout but lost on the swing3.
It appears that the present Editor
- not to mention some of h i s E d i t o r i a l
Board - have been allowed to publish
what i 3 , to "old-fashioned" people
l i k e myself, remarks or a r t i c l e s which
are i n bad taste. Unfortunately, and
perhaps leading to the down f a l l of
t h i s "enlightened" age, bad taste i s
nowadays a l l too often masqueraded as
"independent opinion1 1
, "progressive
thought" or some other such "cultural"
platitude. Offensive remarks contained
in the last Phoenix, whilst boosting the
ego of a group of l i t e r a r y pimps, have
embarrassed the Union, I t i s a p i t y
that many Union members do not yet realise
t h i s . Yet they elect the Board of
Directors of Phoenix. They have elect-
ed, as officers of some other category,
persons who, as ex1
- o f f i c i o member of the
Board of Directors, presumably think
that " i t i s a good thing to have some
controversy for a change". This i s not
broadmindedness - i t i s a combination of
tactlessness, foolishness and
abysmal ignorance of elementary
journalism. So much f o r the Board's
choice of Editor.
Now the E d i t o r i a l Board, poor
innocent sheep, have bejn able to get
themselves into a position of apparent
indispersability whilst complaining of
the oppressive and d i c t a t o r i a l tactics
of t h e i r Editor, They have managed to
create the impression that they are the
only people i n the Union who are capable
#f writing a r t i c l e s f o r the magazine.
Some brave soul suggests that Nr.
Irving be flung back into the prover-
b i a l gutter ( l i k e h i s motor car), and
immediately the E d i t o r i a l Board start
a complicated process of king-making
amongst themselves.
Readers of F e l i x who are members
of the Union should, i n any opinion,
request the complete removal of this
offensive E d i t o r i a l Board. The many
who are capable of writing for Phoenix
or helping to produce i t , should make
themselves known. Phoenix has burnt
so brightly that i t i s almost i n ashes
again. The b i r d must be re-born an
Imperial College Union birdj
John Bramley.
Since Mr, Irving i s unable to reply
to this 'Viewpoint' himself, I feel that
I must do so. F i r s t , I would l i k e to
thank Mr. Bramley f o r h i s compliments
on our handling of the technical and
advertising sides of the magazine.
Had these improvements i n advertising
and sales not been made, Phoenix would
no longer exist.
As a l l the copy of Phoenix i s ino
spected by the Board of Directors before
publication and sinoe they have the
power to remove the Editor and h i s Board,
presumably they are amonp; "the members of
the Union who have not realised that
offensive remarks i n Phoenix have emb-
arrassed the Union," Mr, Bramley does
not state who they are; they are i n
fact the President and Secretary of I.C.
Union, the three constituent college
Presidents, the President of I.C.W.A.
and the Chairmen of the Social and
Athletics Clubs Committees. Let
them not however despair their b e l i e f
that controversy can do a pa^er good -
combination of tactlessness, f o o l i s h -
ness and ignorance of elementary jour.—,
nalism though i t may be - i s shared by
most editors from the New Statesman and
The Spectator down to Felice and Phoenix.
With regard to the E d i t o r i a l Board, i f
he had said that they had managed to
create the impression that they were
the only people w i l l i n g to write f a r
Phoenix he would have been fairer.
As f a r the charge of king-making ( i n
which, of course, Elder S'cstesman
Bramley played no part) I would be
interested to know froirt where Mr.
Bramley obtains h i s information. In
fact the point worrying the Board was
that i f Mr. Irving were forced to
resign as then seemed l i k e l y , none of
them were prepared to take on the job
of Editor and with Mr. Bramley soon
leaving the College there seemed no
outsider at a l l prepared or suitable
for the job. Mr. Bramley ends h i s
l i t t l e a r t i c l e with the battle cry
'Sack the E d i t o r i a l Board and find a
new one1
; f o r the sake of Phoenix I
beg him to change this to 'Find a new
E d i t o r i a l Boa±d and then sack the old
one.'

THOUGHT
If a l l the people who have
spent so much time writing to F e l i x
about the small number of Phoenix con-
tributors had instead spent that time
writing a r t i c l e s for Phoenix, there
would be nothing f o r them to write to
F e l i x about.
If you think that "Phoenix" i s a
mystery - what about this?C)
The first correct answer given to Paul
Porgeas today, before 111

a pint. Associates of Felix not eligible.
AND ANOTHER
I feel th&t certain of the state-
ments made with reference to, and
criticisms levelled a t , Phoenix i n y o i r
l a s t issue should not go unanswered.
F i r s t I must thank Mr. Clark f o r
his concern over my Social Page; may
I take this opportunity of assuring
him that a Social Page w i l l appear i n
the next issue.
Mr. Clark utates that "no attempt
has been made to c o l l e c t or encourage
l i t e r a r y material from students of the
College". Here he makes evident h i s
complete ignorance of the true state of
a f f a i r s . I myself could bring forward
a large number of people whom I have
asked to make a contribution to Phoenix,
and the majority of the E d i t o r i a l board
could do the same.
Mr. Clark i s only the latest i n a
long l i n e of people who over the years
have complained of 'a lack of writers f o r
Phoenix. I may state that the Editor-
i a l Board i s f u l l y aware that there are
not enought people i n the College w i l l i n g
to write. Mr. Clark might do more good
i f he were to attack those who, though
able to write, are unwilling, rather
than the Editor and h i s Board who are trying
their hardest to produce a balanced mag-
azine from a short supply of material.
I would respectfully agree with
both Mr. Fotter and Mr. Clark that some
of the a r t i c l e s i n the last issue were
in extremely bad taste and out of place
in Phoenix. This was pointed out to
the Editor by certain members of the
E d i t o r i a l Board, He, however, chose
to trust h i s own judgement, as he i s
entitled t o do.
Mr. Irving himself states that "we
have not touched the Union subsidy since
the present e d i t o r i a l team took over".
Whilst this i s s t r i c t l y true I feel i t
should be pointed out that at the time
of writing the above statement Mr.
Irving had not received the b i l l f o r the
last two issues. This b i l l has now
been presented and shews a considerable
loss on these issues. This of course
means that the mailing of 30° copies
of Phoenix to public schools w i l l not
be subsidised out of p r o f i t s , but that,
since we are already committed to i t
(owing to this information being passed
on to advertisers), the cost w i l l have
to be carried by the next two issues of
the Phoenix.
