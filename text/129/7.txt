ROVER CREW
4 pairs and 2 covered pairs of
knees met late on Friday evening to
venture on a night hike. On climbing
from Oaterham ante the Dams, only then
was i t realised that the night, was a
dear, cloudless, sharp and moonlight
night. The frost made the going easy
but somewhat hard and i t s keenness kept
the party at a brisk pace. On moving
eastwards along the escarpment face of
the Downs the regel beauty of the night
opened up before us. It was due to
the perfection of the night and the
able leading of C.H. Hookenday that
the hike proved most successful and
for me at least the best ever attended.
After a quick brew of tea the escarpment
was left near Tatsfield and a N.E.
course taken through Doune into Chela-
field where the 6.33 a.m. train to
Charing Cross was caught.

SPORT MATCH
INTER-HOSTEL- SOCCER
The keenly awaited challenge match
between the Old and Gardens Hostels
finally took place at Harlington on
Sunday, 18th January and resulted in a
convincing 9-5 victory for the brilliant
Gardens Hostel team over their gallant
opponents.
The afternoon's entertainment
began with lunch in the pavilion, and
then both teams adjourned to the bar
to decide who should hove the kick-
off. This was won by the well-trained
Old Hostel team by a sip in 60 see's.
The teams then summoned up enough
courage to venture out into the cold
air, and were welcomed by the muddiest
pitch Harlington has seen this season.
The match was started with a lively
skirmish between the two wardens
which continued until the referee
informed them that the game was played
with a ball. The Old Hostel team
auickly settled into their stride and
went into a 2-1 lead after, a few min-
utes. However, the Gardens team
gradually warmed up and, playing mag-
nificent football, went into a 5-2
lead by half-time.
The Old Hostel resumed after the
interval with plan X and scored 2 quick
goals, but the Gardens came back to re-
gain their lead and would have scored
even more i f I.C.'s ballet dancer, Mike
Vine, had not been in superb form in
goal.
After the match the teams had tea
and 22 tired players had an enjoyable
evening in the customary fashion;
RIFLE CLUB
Here is a club which, as has been
pointed out elsewhere, has been extremely
successful in the University 'Engineers
Cup* and London Small Bore leagues i n
the past. To date however, team
performances (A teams excluded) have
not produced quite such good results
though they have been far from poor as
the following summary shows:

In addition to the above, three
of an annual series of friendly matches
have been shot. These were against
the Metropolitan Police, a victory for
I.C., against Birmingham University and
against Cranwell, two more victories
for the College. In the first of these,
team captain,- Neville Ebsworth obtained
the best I.C. score and so received
his second Silver Spoon from the Police.

It has been announced that after
the matches played last term, the I.C*
and Middlesex Hospital Women's swimming
team is now showing the top position
with Goldsmiths' College i n the Univer-
sity of London Women's Swimming Leacue
Another victory for I.C. was recorded
on Friday when they beat Westfield by
27-24. The opposition from Bedford
which included Christine Godden proved
too much in the previous week.
The Squash team triumphed over U.C.
to win 4-1 after having lost in October.
Unfortunately a weakened team lost the
next week to Kings by 4 matches to 1.
The table tennis team was beaten. • • <
The hockey team would like i t to
be known that some matches were played
last term. This term unfortunately
no matches have been played due to the
fact that either our opponents were
playing in a University Cup-tie or
that our opponents were unable to find
a team.

Despite their appearance,

BILLIARDS & SNOOKER
Dear Sir,
I would like to bring to your
attention the existence of the above
club. It was formed towards the end
of last Session but has only just begun
to find i t s feet .
Due to a surprising lack of either
tables or teams at the London Colleges,
matches have only Just been arranged.
Last term, a snooker match was played
against Regent Street Polytechnic at
hems. We lost 4-0. At the return
match, on January 14th, we drew 2-2.
The team was:
1. D.H. Miller
2. E.G. Stephens
3. A. Owen
4. A.J. Caves
Matches have also been arranged with
Northern and Chelsea Polyteolinics. The
away match with Northern Polyteohnio
resulted in a win (4-0) for Imperial.
The same team played for Imperial with
P. Alison as reserve.
A knock-out handicap, with automat-
ic entry for a l l members i s being arr-
anged whilst a ladder has been function-
ing for some time. It is satisfying
to note that the olub membership has
recently increased to 30.
lours faithfully,
L. Massey.

WATER POLO
Last Tuesday night, the I.C. water
polo team, although apparently weak-
ened -through injuries provided the first
real surprise of this seasons league when
they hammered St. Mary's Hospital, who
were unbeaten in league matches for
nearly 2 years, by 6 goals to 1.
Playing fast attractive polo, I.C.
soon took the lead, when a quickly
taken free throw by Hart gave Jones an
easy goal. Soon afterwards Jones
scored a brilliant individual goal to
put I.C. two up. However shortly
afterwards Hart was sent out," and this
enabled Marys to reduce the arrears.
However on his return,fine forward play,
backed up by sound defensive work from
Bregazzi and Church enabled I.C. to
increase the lead to 5-1 by the interval,
through goal* by Basham 2, and Harford,
one of Basham's goals being a fine lob
which completely deceived the goalkeep-
er. Shortly after the interval Jones
and a Mary's player were sent out for
indulging i n a f i s t i c battle i n the
water, and soon followed by another
Mary's player, for a foul on Basham.
I.C. men hammered away at the Mary's
goal but had l i t t l e success.
Occasional Mary's attacks were oap-
ably dealt with, by I.C.'s Australian
goalkeeper Macndllan. Finally a goal
by Harford gave I.C. a 6-1 lead which
they held to the final whistle.
I.C. II have not had such good
fortune, but did not disgrace them-
selves in taking only one point out of
4 from Chelsea, the prospective Div
III champions. Scoring 2-1 one week,
and drawing 3-3 the next. I.C. I l l
consolidated their position at the top
of Div IV with an easy 2-0 win over
Westminster Hospital.
On Friday, I.C. gained a deserved
7-5 viotory over Regent Street Poly,
after being 5-1 down shortly after
halftime. However a weakened second
team were unable to keep up the sound
work and last 3-2 to St. Barts. Hosp.
