This term's Rugby began for the
1 st XV with a game against Harlequins
"A" as satisfying as any we have had
this season. Played on a pitch i n
exc_ll«t fXtidition whioh favoured
good open play., I.C. had an exciting
win, the f i n a l result being 19-^10.
The opposition back: division soon
showed i t s potential when t h e i r stand
off Jinked his way througi"i for a score
under the posts. The t r y was convert-
ed I.e. did not reply until, shortly
before half-time when Wright walked over
the ^uins f u l l back t o core- The
conversion from very near the posts was
taken i n typi-0 8 1
-! Hearn fashion, leaving
I..C. 5-3 down at the interval, which did
not give a true r e f l e c t i on of the game
up to that point.
S O C C E R
IC REACH UL. FINAL
I.C. reached the U.L. Cup Pinal,
for the f i r s t time since 194-8, when
they beat Battersea 3-2 on L.S.E.'s
ground l a s t Saturday.
The ground was i n very good con-
d i t i o n for the game and right from the
kick-off the determined I.C. team star-
ted putting on the pressure. After
going very near on occasions, the i n -
evitable happened and I.C. opened their
account with a fine goal by Coups after
about twenty mmute3 play. This was
soon followed by two good goals by Exflt
Finney, but ju3t before the interval
Battersea replied with a goal from one
of t h e i r break-aways t o make the half-
time score 3-1 t o I.C.
In the second half, only fine keep-
ing by Hughes, i n the opponents goal,
prevented I.C. from adding to their
total, Battersea, however, came a
l i t t l e more into the Dicture an i scored
another goal five minutes from the end
of play. The I.C. team,managed to hold
out for the remainder of the game and
so play i n the f i n a l . We should l i k e
to thank very mxch the land of suppor-
ters, who, though small r e a l l y made
themselves heard during this important
gam*.
I.C. w i l l meet Kings, who beat
L.S.E. 2-0 i n the other semi-final, i n
the f i n a l on February 21st. at Motspur
Park, when i t i s hoped thflt the College
mascots plus a large contingent from
I.C. w i l l be present t o ajve the team
the support i t w i l l need.
In the two other matches played on
Saturday the 2nd XI drew 2-2 with South-
ampton 2rVi' s with goals by Paddle ana
Bullock and the 6th XI were beaten by
Chelsea II*s by 7 goals to 3-

I.C. *s lack of good fortune con-
tinued i n the second half, when from
an intercepted pass the Quins adaed 5
points; and a good 3/4 Movement c u l -
minated, i n the touchdown by Margretts
being disallowed. I.C. were not
discouraged i n 3pite of being 10-3 down
about 20 minutes from the end and sup-
erior fitness began to t e l l . * A fine
try by right wing Milward gave the side
a further 8 points and renewed impetus.

enjoyable game.

The club has been able to maintain
laat term' 3 success story without much
d i f f i c u l t y - only one game being lost
of a l l the games played since Christmas.
However, as the weather ruxc. ensureu '.sat
only 3 games be played during this Der-
iod i t oan be assumed that the teams
have not been entirely extenied. j.t
is very disappointing that of the 3
pitches at Harlington not one has been
reported f i t to play on at any time this
year.
U.L. Pup
The Association Football Club are
now into the f i n a l round of the U.L.
Cup and both Rugger and Hockey are
looking forward '
.
o being there with
them. With a bit of iuck, some
hard p ay and some -jood rousing support-
ers w. *noulri manage to bring home a
triple crown this year. As far as
the hockey i s concerned, having beaten
Battersea, the winners for the last few
years, we now look forward to the
opportunity of "trampling* UC into the
Harlington earth in the semi-finals on
Wed.4th Feb. Supporters are very
welcome so why not come along and join
in the fun/ Transport may be arranged
i f enough names are forthcoming. A
list will be posted on the hookey
;lub board. It ha? the makings of a
good game but with the right supoort we
should be through to the finals On

On Wednesday January 14th I.C. I I
defeated U.C. I I and London Hospital at
Hampstead, over a course which was f r o -
zen hard and i n nay places ice-oovered.
The race was won by P. C l i f t o n , with
P. Warren second; these two first-year
runnera are steadily improving, and show
great promise.
Saturday, January 17th was the date
of the annual t r i p to Sheffield. The
usual weather conditions were encoun-
tered, and over a snow-covered course
the Sheffield University team beat I.C.
by 30 points to 52. The s i x scoring
I.C. men were Larkum (2), Gilbert (8),
Brown (9), Clare (13) and James (14).
The "sport" at Sheffield was, as always,
excellent, and a merry band returned i n
the early hours of Sunday morning.
On the same day, our second team
were defeated by Westminster College,
26 points to 29, at Enfield. The
individual winner was J . Jaeger, with
Feam 3rd and C l i f t o n 6th.
John Collins, our President, was
running i n the Inter-Counties Champ-
ionships and was the second Bucks,
man to f i n i s h .
The following Wednesday saw the
t h i r d team at Hampstead f o r a match
against Royal Vets. I I . Conditions
were quite different from those of
the previous week, as the ground had
thawed and was back t o i t s usual muddy
state. The result o f the race was
that I.C. I l l beat Vets I I , 24 points
to 32, i n a very close race. The
outstanding performance of the day was
that of Rob Cheeney who came 2nd with
Rayment J>rd and Smith 4th.
Last Saturday the -^ueen Mary
College 7"? mile race was held, over
a gruelling course consisting of
ploughed land, roads, and cart-tracks,
with a few streams to negotiate.
John ColJ ins ran very well indeed t o
f i n i s h second, behind Heywood of
Reading, with Adams of Sheffield third*
There was a gap of more than a minute
between these three and the fourth man
J. Bernard, who i s running extremely
well, wa3 12th with J . Jaeger 13th, A. _
Brown 19th, P. C l i f t o n 27th and M. t%t ffc
Glare 44th.
The team race was won by Sheffield
(102 points), but Imperial College I were
second (117 points) and were awarded the
"John Banks Trophy" for the f i r s t London
College true to our traditions, one
second team ran i n this race from
Imperial College.
