GRENNAN TALKS TO GUILDS
N
U
S
T he general air of "sport" ana entertainment which prevailed at "Guilds" Uhicm
meetings last term, gave way to a mare serious trend'cop the 15th January.
A motion that Guilds Uniai should beoome affilliated to K.U.S. was on the
agenda, and a certain amount of expectancy was in the air.
The lack of experience of serious debate in Guilds became apparent when the
proposer, Mr. C.H. Satan, announced that he had brought along the President of N.U.S.
to address the meeting.
An immediate query from
Mr. Chadwiok revealed that Mr. Grstman
had not been offioally invited, and
considerable argument followed as to
whether he should speak - reaction
varied from the straightforward
attitude - the man is here, lets hear
what he has to say, to the "constitu-
tional" attitude, that someone who i s
not a member of the Union should not
speak when a serious motion i s being
discussed.
After considerable wrangling, the
mood of the House changed to "let. get
on with i t " , The President ruled that
Mr. Grennan should not speak as i t
would almost certainly affect the vote
to an undesirable extent, and he then
called upon Mr. Sohan to speak in
support of the motion. Mr. Sohan was
evidently unprepared to do this and
after some further rapid exchanges the
motion was withdrawn by the proposer.
At this point the mood lightened,
and Mr. Garnett, who had entered earlier
and had been allowed to remain by the
President, was seen to be moving steal-
thily towards the door.
He was called upon to remain, and
answered queries en several topics
before being allowed to leave quietly.
After "Any Other Business" had
been dealt with, the N.U.S. President,
Dennis Greonan, was asked to address
the House, and gave an outline of the
work.and aims of the N.U.S. He pre-
faced his talk with an apology far -tie
trouble which his appearance had caused
but said that he had been given to
understand that the invitation was an
official one; as the invitation was
not given by an officer of the Uniai,
Guildsmen will no doubt require an
explanation of this from someone.
A discussion followed, whioh was
Decerning heated, when the meeting had
to be concluded owing to shortage of
time.
The President apologised to Dennis
Greiman for the embarrassment whioh had
been caused him, and thanked him f«r
speaking.
A GUILDS UNION NOTE
The question of affiliation to
N.U.S., has lain dormant for some years
now, and I was hoping to hear the
points for and against, put by Guilds-
men at the last Union meeting.
Unfortunately, the ease for had
not been prepared and the discussion
only revealed a desire to know more cm
the part of most Union Members. In
consideration of this i t i s perhaps
fortunate that a rote was not actually
taken on the subject.
A atrcnger lead from the chair
was evidently expected, and with seme
justification, for the reasons for
Imperial College withdrawing from
N.U.S. oan only be found by looking
up old oopies of "Felix" and by search-
ing the Union files. One or two
additional reasons far continuance of
our present position are known only to
members of student committees etc.
The reasons are mainly general
ones, and ocnoem I.C. as a whole, as
well aa the constituent colleges.
N.U.S. is a non-political organi-
sation, but, in making this claim, i t
aeans that i t i s not oonearned with
National Politics, and does not concern
itself with the left or right-wing
tendencies of its members. By i t s
very farm, however and by its declared
alma, i t s activities are deeply politi-
cal in that i t makes representations
to Ministers and ministries and, aa
Mr. Grennan told us, prides itself on
being an effective "pressure group".
In other words, N.U.S. wields a certain
amount of power, and in order to obtain
the various advantages of affiliation,
this side of its activities must be
condoled in all its aspects.
The nature of N.U.S. i s such that
the power whioh i s related to the m
e
m
b
-
ership claimed, is wielded by those
interested and active enough to do the
work necessary.

Thus, though the bare aims of the
Union may reflect a democratic mean of
student opinion, the manner of their
implementation may not and i t is with
this aspect of N.JJ.S. affairs, that I.C.
often found itself at variance.
The position is aggravated by the
fact that many of the members of
N.U.S. are part-time students, giving
it an — m a l l y hij^i proportion of i n -
active members.
It was felt that in important
matters I.C. can make its voice heard,
and this has been barn out in practice.
Arguments,on how far I.C. Union has
represented the Students' aase on this
or that National issue, seem to me to
be mare criticisms of the present farm
of I.C. Union, activities than reasons
for I.C. to place responsibility for
representation in the hands of N.U.S.
The extant and effectiveness of
I.C. influenoe In a given issue is
difficult to gauge, but i t i s even more
difficult in the oase of N.U.S. whioh
definitely seeks publicity of this side
of its activities.
Our moral duty to be represented
on a body whioh /

- to arbitrate on
our behalf, i s no greater than our
duty to make our own representations cn
matters which ocnoern us, and i n the
past i t has been found that our obliga-
tions are far better discharged in tMLa
manner.
This, then is the oruxof the argu-
ment. There are many other arguments
cn both sides but these are practical
matters and are subsidiary to the main
issue. The financial aspect in par-
ticular is important to "Guilds* but
this i s an internal matter and I do not
propose to discuss i t in the pages of
