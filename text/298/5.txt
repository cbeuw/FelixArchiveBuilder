MIKE OSBORNE AT THE 100
The first thing to be said
about Mike Osborne is that
he is probably the most
honest musician in British
modern jazz. Every note
Ossie plays he means,
whether in the context of
Christ McGregor's astonish-
ing Brotherhood of Breath,
the various pick-up bands
and small groups that form
for odd gigs, based on a nu-
cleus of a dozen or so music-
ians associated with the sem-
inal British contemporary
jazz groups of Mike West-
brook, Graham Collier and
McGregor, or the group in
which he really shows his
paces as one of the world
alto players — his own trio,
with the South Africans
Harry Miller and Louis
Mholo.
Osborne first became no-
ticed for his work with the
Mike Westbrook band,
where he tended to be type-
cast as the band's Johnny-
Hodges figure, playing a
very lyrical role and being
rather overshadowed by
John Surman's playing the
baritone sax with a speed
and range previously un-
dreamt of. Outside the band,
first with the quartet he co-
led with Surman and then
with his own trio, his play-
ing became more aggressive,
though retaining its lyricism,
and so personal that when
Surman ' sits-in' with the
trio on his occasional returns
to this country it is now he
that is overshadowed.
Osborne's concentration
and musical memory are for-
midable: when not soloing
himself he listens hard to
what the other musicians are
playing and he will often
pick a phrase from someone
else's solo and develop it
himself later. For instance,
I remember hearing him try
with a rhythmic figure from
a drum solo and remould it
until, astonishingly, it be-
came the old Jimmy Young

'
type tune ' My Resistance is
Low' — though still sound-
ing completely Mike Os-
borne and with no sense of
sending it up — and on this
he built his solo. Similarly,
I remember him playing
'Secret Love' with Louis
Mholo thundering away in
the background in a manner
that would have disinte-
grated a thousand Kathy
Kirby's had they been pre-
sent.
Mholo is the perfect drum-
mer for Osborne and has
probably played no small
part in developing the lat-
ter's powerful style. He is
the antithesis of the Buddy
Rich school of showmen
drummers, using a minimum
of technique but playing
with a drive and energy that
are absolutely compelling.
He will play for a whole
evening without using so
much as a basic roll, but
producing explosive cracks
from the rims of his drums
and loud rumblings from his
bass drum until he has built
up excitement to such a pitch
that the only resolution is to
snatch at his cymbals and
produce instant silence, over
which Osborne and Miller
scream on, then slowly calm
things down: a sensation
that must be akin to that of
accelerating towards a pre-
cipice, going over the edge
and then finding your des-
cent slowing down until you
land gently but shaken.
It was the trio, with Chris
Lawrence standing in for
Harry Miller on bass, that
played the first set at the
100 Club. Osborne, though
not on his top form, played
brilliantly by any standards
but his own, and there was
a very fine bass solo which
developed into a dialogue be-
tween Lawrence and Mholo
wielding sleigh-bells and one
of those curious instruments
made of tin-plate with a
sprung striker which pro-
duces an eerie whistling
sound when shaken and con-
trolled by the thumb.
After the interval the trio
was joined by Mongezi Feza
on pocket trumpet, like
Mholo an alumnus of the
Chris McGregor band, and
the American altoist An-
thony Braxton, a member of
the group Circle, completed
by drummer Barry Altschul
and two drop-outs from the
Miles Davis group — pianist
Chick Corea and the British
bassist Dave Holland (some-
time member of the Piltdown
Men !). Feza was his usual
lively self and Braxton, after
initially seeming ill at ease
with such vigorous support
from Mholo, played beauti-
fully, taking the band into
Monk's 'Straight, No Chaser'
and in his solo moving from
this to Coltrane's 'Impres-
sions,' before finishing the
evening with a virtuoso ca-
denza alternating between
the extreme registers of his
instrument.
The Mike Osborne trio are
playing at Imperial College
on Sunday, February 14th.

EROTISSIMO
a n d o t h e r p r o d u c t s
"EROTISSIMO" (at the
Paris Pullman) is the first
feature film by Gerard Pires,
director of the delightful
short film, " S.W.B."
The story acts as a frame-
work for a satirical, if not
particularly cynical, expose
of the role of sex-orientated
advertising in the consumer
society. Annie (Annie Gira-
dot), a well off middle class
housewife, is busily engaged
in trying out everything in
the consumer armoury of
hair styles, perfumes, aphro-
disiac cooking and flimsy
easily-torn dresses in order
to arouse her husband Phil-
ippe (Jean Yanne) who
seems to have lost interest in
her. Meanwhile he is exhaus-
ted by his attempts to con-
ceal irregularities in his baby
ware company's books from
the zealous tax inspector
(Francois Blanche), and so
Annie tries the looking-for-a-
lover gambit with similar
lack of success. When the ap-
parently hoodwinked tax in-
spector leaves, Philippe and
Annie depart for their tax-
evaded villa in Spain, but a
chance meeting with the tax-
man reveals all.
" Erotissimo" is saying
roughly the same as God-
ard's " Two or Three Things
I Know About Her" (re-
cently shown at the same
cinema) but in a far less ob-
tuse and more easily acces-
sible way. It is also enter-
taining both on the superfic-
ial story-telling level, and in
the ironic employment of the
" trendy" styles of design,
living, typified by Annie's
brother Bernard, and filming
that it sets out to mock.
But the best joke is on the
audience, who from the title
of the film may expect the
ultimate in sex titilation,
only to find themselves
cheated, as all victims of ad-
vertising are, when the film
turns out to be no more ero-
tic than the comodities Annie
buys — "Erotissimo" is the
brand name of cooking oil.

Jam Session
After playing some very
tight music for a couple of
hours, with Stevie Winwood
alternating between lead
guitar and organ, they left
the stage only to be brought
back twice for an encore. On
the second occasion everyone
was surprised to see Johnny
Winter come bounding on the
stage. There then followed an
incredible jam session for
about 20 minutes with
Johnny getting unbelievable
sounds out of his guitar.
After playing his most
famous hit "Johnny B
Goode", the group left the
stage only to be brought
back again by the thunder-
ous applause. Unfortunately
this was only to apologise for
being unable to play all
night. A remarkable evening.
