4 FELIX February 11th, 1971
Rare entertainment
With Union meetings be-
coming fewer and farther be-
tween (JW please note) — //
should be a relief to read a
somewhat "light" report of
the last meeting.
The union meeting held on
the 28th January was, as us-
ual, a singularly dull affair.
However, here is a brief ac-
count of the proceedings.
The meeting began with the
subject of the refectories.
After some heated discus-
sions on the proposal to in-
crease the bar prices to help
offset the staggering losses
of the refectories, and the
proposed price increases in
the refectories themselves, a
motion was passed suggest-
ing that we should be
allowed to consult the books
and that we were opposed to
any price increases, in the
bar or otherwise, until a full
investigation had been made
into the subject of the refec-
tories in general. For any-
body who wants more details
concerning this matter, I
suggest they consult the last
edition of FELIX.
*Jext business was the
president's report. The presi-
dent expressed her concern
about the proposal to set up
a committee of Hall ward-
ens; in particular, who was
to chair the committee, and
was the chairman to be elec-
ted, or appointed and
whether the union was to
have any say in the matter?
However, the situation is
still in the melting pot and
until anything definite is de-
cided, no action will be
taken.
As the cleaners in South-
side have had a shilling a
week rise all round, it is pro-
posed that the hall rents be
increased by nine shillings a
week. This rise in rent is in-
evitable, although it is hoped
to cut it down to four and
six a week by having the
rooms cleaned less frequent-
ly. However, the subject has
still to come before the hall
committees.
Next was a rather confus-
ing motion from John Mc-
Cullough, which only he and
Piers Corbyn seemed to un-
derstand. However it did
bring a little sorely needed
light relief to the proceed-
ings. The motion was de-
feated.
Next was a motion, which
was carried unanimously, ex-
pressing our support to the
A.A. in their bid to become
part of I.C. It is hoped that
the talks are resumed as
soon as possible. (They were
broken off by I.C.).
We then came to the main
business on the agenda. The
N.U.S. Grants Review. The
N.U.S. are starting a cam-
paign to review the subject
of grants at higher education
establishments. The main
points are as follows: (1)
opposition to student loans.
(2) increase the grant to al-
low for the increase in the
cost of living. They have not
risen since 1962. (3) sort out
the anomalies in the present
award system, the most strik-
ing of which is the distinc-
tion made between students
when they are being consi-
dered for an award. For
instance, a student studying
for a degree will receive
more than say a student
studying for H.N.C. or for
Life at the Top
Whilst half of Elec Eng 3
go for interviews at the BBC
and return dolefully when
rejected, one 2nd year Elec
Eng student already has his
foot in the door, in front of
the glass panel, rather than
behind.
Andy Finney's first step
into the business (apart from
cribbing the initial and sur-
name of a famous actor) was
in 1968 when he and a school
friend made field recordings
of folk singing around Stoke-
on-Trent, and produced a
disc under the label Smoke
Records. It was decidedly
low-fidelity, and sold only
99 copies, in spite of Andy
inundating the newly opened
Radio Stoke-on-Trent with
requests, and sending a copy
to John Peel.
At that point he became
one of the first and most suc-
cessful of local radio's han-
gers-on (groupie?) working as
a part-time voluntary technic-
ian. During the summer be-
tween school and university
he was employed at £10 per
week, reading news, making
continuity announcements
and doing chat on record re-
quest programmes. He also
managed to wangle a pro-
gressive music programme
at 7.00 p.m. on Mondays,
just after half the potential
audience had been discon-
nected by the piped T V
people to make way for BBC
2.
On arriving at IC Andy
applied to the BBC for a DJ
audition, and was apparently
successful (or pulled strings),
and this lead to 4 weeks on
"Pop Workshop" at £20
per week last summer.
Then he discovered that
his manager from Stoke was
now Assistant Head of Local
Radio Development, and
consequently managed to get
in on Radio London from
the start (October '70), first
on Saturday afternoon sports
programme operations, and
now as under-chat-man on
the Friday night marathon
(8—midnight, V H F 95.3)
which labours under the title
"The Pictures are Better."
The pay, however, is not —
£6 per show, and not even a
credit in Radio Times. But
IC Carnival got a plug when
Dennis Taylor was featured
live, boasting about his tidd-
leywinks arrest.
a diploma of education.
Apart from some heated
discussion on the subject of
the means test, there was
no opposition to the motion
apart from the young social-
ists whose motives seemed
confused to say the least.
However the matter does not
end there. A lot of help is
needed in the campaign, and
anybody who is interested
in helping should contact
those concerned immediate-
iy.
The Young Socialists were
again involved in the next
motion. They suggested that
I.C. union donate £50 to the
postman's emergency fund.
However, any chance of
pushing the motion through,
was ruined by their predict-
able "force the Tories to re-
sign" bit. It was a pity, for
their motion was a com-
mendable one, though it is
doubtful whether I.C. could
afford such a sum, consider-
ing the dire financial straits
that the Union is now in !
Martin Black brought the
house down again by chal-
lenging the quorum in an
extremely loud voice. How-
ever the wind was taken out
of his sails a little when the
secretary informed him that
a count had been taken and
more than 300 were present.
I estimated the number to be
nearer 280. The meeting
closed at 2.40.
