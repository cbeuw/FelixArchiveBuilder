8 FELIX February 11th, 1971
No sir, the photo below
does not show IC students
rushing to buy FELIX (or
the Beano). In fact, its a pic-
ture of last year's Hyde Park
relay. This year's take place
in the near future.
News in Brief
Custom in the Union all-
day buttery, now in its third
week of operation, is con-
tinuing to improve, with
more meals served during the
afternoon. It is hoped that
pies, etc., will be restored to
the Union Bar at lunchtimes
in the near future.
* * *
FELIX has been asked to
point out ito the organisers of
Clubs Dinners, etc., that it
has been agreed that A L L
such dinners can continue in
the Union Dining Hall, and
that they should resist at-
tempts to move them to
Southside or College Block.
A Union survey of people
booking for Dinner in Hall
has shown that A L L of them
prefer to hold the function
in the Union.

To put everyone straight, this is a hitch between teams
of 5 people, from I.C., Q.M.C. and U.C. to visit all of Lon-
don, Edinburgh, Belfast, Dublin and Cardiff in any order.
The hitchers will be on a points basis — ie; first back takes
zero points, second back one point etc., and the winning
team is the one with the least points, and takes 50% of the
pool money (collected from sponsors and raffle tickets) for
its own Carnival charity.
The I.C. team will be Chris Chant, Mining I; Bill
Griffiths, Min. Tech I, Paul (the Foot) Close, Physics I; Stu
Grant, Civ. Eng. I; Steve (Flier) Bugg, Geology III; who are
all expected (and will) do it in under 40 hours. (The previous
winning time was done by Steve Bugg last year in 55 hours.)
Our incentive is the money to be won from the raffle, and
the setting up of a Guiness record for this event, so buy a
ticket for 1/- to guess the time of the first person back and
win a handy ten quid (lOOOp) prize. The hitch begins at
Euston station at 8.00 hours tomorrow and prospective col-
lectors eager to flounce money off the rush-hour traffic and
give our lads a bit of support should meet at 7.00 a.m. in
Southside Bar where a few small beers will be provided free.

The last tiddleywinks race down Oxford Street was such
a success that the Met police have kindly invited us to DO
IT AGAIN ! ! And this time we've got licences to collect
money illegally at least.
The same rules apply (see earlier FELIX) over a shorter
and vastly improvised course. The latter is arbitrary and is
specified only from Marble Arch via tube to Bond Street,
whence along Oxford Street to Piccadilly Circus (not via
West End Central Police Station) where after CAROL SING-
ING and the traditional jar in the Cockney Pride Tavern we
return to South Ken via the underground.
Anybody who took part in the last tiddleywinks ex-
travaganza really enjoyed it, so the newly laid course (par-
ticularly the underground section) and the spectacle of people
falling after the Lyceum all-nighter will guarantee a good
"game".
MEET M A R B L E A R C H 10.00 — 10.30 a.m.

On Sunday Feb. 14th the St. Valentine's Disco, or cock-
roach stomp, will be held in Southside lower refectory, the
the C.S. (it's a gas!) disco and the Neil Irvine Rockbusters
playing LIVE, old, meaty rock 'n roll numbers—2/6, cheap,
just like the food used to be.
THE DRINK-A-PUB-DRY ATTEMPT, courtesy of the
***** and •****. I.C. has always had a reputation for heavy
drinking (take a look at Stan) so we might as well live up
to it. The idea is to clean out a pub of keg and draught beer
(xxx) so we need about 200 willing throats. The name of the
pub will be revealed in strategic places on the Wednesday
to prevent the landlord ordering a couple of tankers, bolting
the doors, or watering the beer etc. etc. Vocal line-up and
tactical talk in Ye Olde Union Bar 600 — 6.00 p.m.

On Sunday February 14th there will be an A to Z rally
around London. The finish will be at a Pub about three
hours later. All you will need is an A to Z map of London
and some sort of car. No special driving skill will be needed.
An entry fee of 10/- will be charged. The prizes will be
paid in petrol.
Entry must be limited to 24 cars.
If you would like to enter please fill in the application
slip and return it to me via the internal post, enclosing a
cheque for 10/- payable to City and Guilds Union.
After last year's incredible, obstructive, stroboscopic
mind blowing singing, eyeball dilating stripper, C&G are
proud to announce not only another bigger, better and much
improved model (in C&G colours!), but also a drag-artist(e).
What next? Bring a bottle.
HELP is particularly needed at the FETE (Feb. 20th)
in organising and running stalls. Eighty letters were recently
sent out to all clubs and societies with ZERO replies. The
possibilities for a stall are endless, and the time involved for
each year/dept/hall to organise one is a matter of a few
hours. It is hoped to attract the South Ken/Knightsbridge
clientele to this so many more stalls are needed NOW —
anything from roll-a-penny to blackjack.
We also need multitudinous volunteers to poke begging
letters through letter boxes. About 5,000 letters in 5,000 letter
boxes in the South Ken and Knightsbridge districts. Volun-
teers are PAID 10/- a hundred. Sign on the notice board in
Mech Eng. ICU office or Carnival office (lunchtimes).
THE "GRAND COLLECTIONS" are on Monday when
we systematically flounce the underground system, and on
Sat. 20th before the fete when we systematically flounce the
overground system.
