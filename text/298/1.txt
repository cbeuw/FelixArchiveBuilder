IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION, 11th FEBRUARY, 1971 No. 298
N e w selection
scheme suggestions
A new selection scheme for
Hall and Student Houses,
aimed at giving every LC.
undergraduate a year's resi-
dence, is to be presented by
the Union to the Student
Residence Committee.
In the past, there has not
been a sufficient number of
places to achieve this aim,
but with the advent of Lin-
stead Hall and the Student
Houses, there are now almost
1100 places. Since the pres-
ent undergraduate admission
target is 950, it is now pos-
sible in theory to offer every-
one a place.
Under the scheme, thought
up by Halls and Houses Rep.
John Sommer half of each
year's intake of freshmen
would be offered a place by
their departments. The rest
would be given a choice of a
place in their second or third
years. If by any chance there
were too many applicants for
any one year, the unsuccess-
ful handful of people could
be chosen by a random pro-
cedure. Students who had
lived in an inter-collegiate
Hall would also be elimin-
ated in this circumstance.
John has suggested reduc-
ing the number of postgradu-
ates in residence; any P.Gs.
who were U.Gs. at I.C.
would have had a year in,
anyway. Of the 90 places it is
proposed should be given to
postgraduates, John suggests
75 should go to overseas ap-
plicants, and Hall Commit-
tees would allocate the rest
to the most worthy appli-
cants, using the information
on the application forms.
(N.B. In the case of other
applicants, this information

would be used for room allo-
cation only.)
In addition, certain reduc-
tions would be necessary in
certain privileged places.
Re-admissions could be re-
duced from the present level.
John suggests a minimum of
8 per cent; the maximum
would be set by the other
requirements of the scheme,
and would be 10 per cent to
12 per cent.
Wardens places should be
reduced to around 50, and
these should be allocated on
the advice of the Health
Centre, and not used (as hap-
pens in certain halls at pres-
ent) to allow certain people
a third year's residence.
Staff places would, under
this scheme, be reduced to
one place per Hall, with a
maximum of three years resi-
dence. Research assistants
would then be counted not
as Staff, but as P.Gs.
The number of Union
places, 37 at present, would
be reviewed, and possibly re-
duced. Moreover, holders of
Union places would no lon-
ger be able to have a third
year in Residence.
These ideas will be pre-
sented by John and the other
Union representatives at the
Student Residence Commit-
tee's meeting on February
24th. Whether they are ac-
cepted or not, the Union reps
intend to push against un-
democratic practices in Halls,
such as abuse of Warden's
places and election of the
Hall Committee during the
previous session.
Suck Soc
The recent acquisition of
internal phones by secretar-
ies of 3 hall committees in
Southside, which was describ-
ed by Falmouth Hall com-
mittee as childish and one-
upmanship, is ostensibly to
prevent complaints about
noise, etc., from reaching the
wardens. Meanwhile such in-
significant people as the Car-
nival Co-ordinator and Edit-
or of FELIX remain phone-
less.
Hall rents
An increase in the rent in
Halls and Student Houses
appears inevitable for next
session. The Union is propos-
ing an increase in Hall rents
of £1 per week, and asking
that 12/- of this should go
towards a 'building fund' to
provide further accommoda-
tion.
It has been realised for
some time that I.C. rents are
exceptionally low — the
U.G.C. recommended rent is
actually £4/10/- p.w. Down
in Evelyn Gardens, rents are
in fact so low that the Stu-
dent Houses cannot make'
enough surplus to cover the
cost of future re-furnishing
and re-decoration. Moreover,
Hall and House cleaners have
recently been given a pay
rise, which will mean a rent
increase of about 8/- p.w.
anyway.
The Union agreed at the
recent Council meeting to
forward to the Student Resi-
dence Committee a sugges-
tion that Hall rents are in-
creased by £1 per week,
which would bring the rents
to a more realistic level and
more in line with rents at
other Colleges in London.
The surplus increase, i.e.
about 12/-, could go towards
the 'building fund'. This
would enable the College
within a few years to take
out a mortgage for a new
Northside Hall, or to acquire
further Student Houses. The
present residents recently
voted 3:1 in favour of a
rent increase for this purpose,
though possibly some of
these residents may consider
12/- too much.
It has also been suggested
by the College that income
from block bookings, con-
ferences, etc., should go to-
wards a buildings fund in-
stead of subsidising rents in
the Halls.

Brief
Sunday morning newspaper
readers in Falmouth Hall
were heard to pass comment
on the park bench which
four winged messengers de-
posited during the midnight
movie.

Motorists returning to
Princes Gardens late on Sat-
urday night were somewhat
delayed by what appeared to
be a Hillman Imp parked in
the middle of the road. After
waiting a minute or so in the
hope that the offending veh-
icle would move off, passage
was effected by the simple
expedient of mounting the
pavement.
While ignorant of the rea-
son as to why the car was
so placed I hope it was a
warning to motorists who
persist in parking their cars
with all but the rear quarter
on the pavement of the Gar-
dens itself. This is an un-
necessary inconvenience to
passers-by who have thus to
cross the grass—unpleasant
in wet weather.
Action in Physics
Two weeks ago, after the
last union meeting a body of
physics undergraduates visit-
ed the level 8 common room
in the physics building. Its
uniqueness was in the fact
that the level 8 is normally
reserved for staff and post-
graduates. Piers Corbyn,
noted physics P.G., distressed
at this state of affairs, made
an open invitation to all
undergraduates to come up
for coffee. Ironically in his
invitation Mr. Corbyn had
broken no rules.
The undergraduates re-
mained well-behaved, mak-
ing coffee and tea and charg-
ing the proper amount for
these refreshments. Physics
lecturers were seen appear-
ing in the doorway but few
bothered to stay. One notable
exception was Dr. Kibble,
who talked freely with the
undergraduates.
