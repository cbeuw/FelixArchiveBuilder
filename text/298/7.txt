Badminton Success
I honestly feel with the talent
in Mens II their position
should be slightly higher,
and in fact they have only
barely lost to the teams
above them; if they beat
Kings I (who are holding an
equal second position with
Chelsea) they could well be
second as they are ahead in
actual games for.
The ladies are doing well
from the point of view of
having beaten two colleges,
but unfortunately they had
to cancel three of their
matches (which under the
U.L.U. rules are immediately
conceded), thus their position
is in fact unknown to date,
but from other colleges re-
sults they are at least 4th out
of eight colleges.
Coming finally to the Mens
I and Mixed my prediction
at the beginning of the season
has been been very nearly
At the close of last term
the U.L.U. Badminton
League indicated the success
that I.C. Badminton has been
having. The table looked
as below.
Since then the men's IV
have beaten Q.E.C. who up
until this glorious day (Wed.,
27th January and on their
home courts too) held first
position with an unbeaten
record. Showing that with a
full team our position in the
league should be undoubted-
ly higher.
There is not much to say
about Mens III except that
they have been extremely
consistent, having only lost
to first position Q.M.C, 5—4.
We meet them on our courts
soon and hopefully the result
would be reversed then, may-
be putting Mens III in first
position, a position which
they justly deserve.
Mens II also deserve a
good pat on the back as divi-
sion II is a strong division.
Cross Country
Now that the active contingent of the Cross Country Club
are fit and keen, and some team spirit and competitiveness
has arisen, a recognised pack (group of runners of similar
standard) has been formed. As this pack (mostly 1st years)
improves over the next year or so, it should become quite
a barrier to opposing teams.
The creation of the pack began at the U.L. Champion-
ships, although its position was not high enough to produce
a good result. The team came 4th (worst position for years),
though the inclusion of Paul Clarke (bedridden) could have
got 3rd. Individual Positions: Barry Dabrowski 7th (selected
to represent U L U in BUSF Champs), Rog Phelps 13th,
Herman Rooney 27th, Rob Parker 31st, J. Bathurst 36th,
P. Willoughby 37th.
The last Wednesday of last term, the club handicap was
won by Dave Jones (joggers anonymous) closely followed
by James Bathurst. The first five home recorded personal
best times, which shows what they can do given more
incentive.
At the QMC '7^', we returned without the John Brooks
Trophy for the first London College after holding it for
five years. The following Wednesday the London Colleges
League was held at Petersham, and organised by I.C. As
some of our members were required to officiate, only three
runners started for I.C. II, thus a drop to the Second Division
is now inevitable. The first team, however, ran very well,
packing six in the first forty and gaining 4th place with
the top five teams separated by only a few points. The
ever-improving Rog Phelps almost led the team in but was
pipped on the post by Barry Dabrowski, in 14th and 15th
places; others were R. Parker 21st, H. Rooney 31st, R.
Wilson 33rd.
At the U.C. '5', the team position of 12th (behind Ox-
bridge, etc., was good enough to beat all other ULU teams.
Last week the Cross Country Club easily defeated U.C.
(Wednesday) and Kings (Saturday) in friendly matches.
Success is thus beginning to come our way.
justified as we whipped every-
one in sight.
The Mens I even beat N.P.
with only four men by 5—4,
having conceded three games,
and losing their first game;
this meant we had to win the
other five. Thanks to C.
Gaukroger, Souki and Mal-
colm Roberts we were able
to keep an unblemished rec-
ord of not losing a single
match in two seasons.
This season the Mixed
have had a great success. The
original team being G. Geor-
giou, S. Donald, Souki,
Lynn Beynon, Sue Thomp-
son and Brenda Dilley. A
truly formidable team with-
out a doubt. With the choice
of good players at I.C. we
have had frequent guest ap-
pearances by C. Gaukroger,
Hillary Rowson, Mary Short,
Jane Gregory and John
Powell.

The postal strike has
brought a frustrating period
to I.C.P.R.C. At the begin-
ning of the term the club was
well ahead in all but one of
the leagues, and, although the
cards are still being shot,
they cannot of course be post-
ed, which means that we can-
not tell for sure exactly how
far ahead we are.
Of all the I.C. teams, rifle,
pistol, novice, etc., there has
so far been only one defeat,
and that was of the Engineers
'B' team who, unfortunately,
were shooting against a col-
lege with no 'A' team, just a
'B' team. However, both En-
gineers teams (they are not
really engineers), who shoot
their matches shoulder-to-
shoulder with the opposition,
are now firmly entrenched at
the top of their leagues. The
Engineers 'A' will, we hope,
easily carry away the Engin-
eers Cup and by so doing
win the U.L. Small-bore
Rifle Championship.
The London University
Inter-University League ' C
team, who are by chance all
members of I.C., are now
lying second and would be
first if a card had not been
mislaid. If they finish second,
at least they will know that
they can beat the team who
is at present in first place.

I.C. 1st XI 2, Letchworth 1
With the pitch rather
waterlogged, I.C. adapted to
the damp conditions well, and
after twenty minutes took the
lead. John Manning, having
beaten his man, drew clear
down the right wing, centred
hard into the goalmouth, and
after the deflection off the
goalkeeper, Pete Bates scored
the goal. The second goal
was again started by the right
wing, who centred into the
D, and Mark, cutting in from
the left, beat the goalkeeper
with a fine shot.
The second-half started off
with disaster for the left-half
Martin Field, who, endeav-
ouring to clear his lines (al-
though the goalie called for
the ball) could only deflect
the ball into his own goal.
Despite this setback, I.C.
settled down and played out
time for a well-deserved win.

Editorial
Thankfully, my pleas have been answered and the in-
creased flow of copy means I need not draw out my pearls
of wisdom—this week at least!
As you can gather from the rest of the page, I.C. are well
to the fore of University competitions, the soccer, rugby
and hockey clubs all having reached their respective semi-
finals. The girls of I.C.W.S.C. have gone one better and are
already in the final of the Penney (hockey) Cup. When one
considers the amazing brevity (?) of their numbers compared
to the other colleges they really must be congratulated
and we wish them the best of luck in the final.
The strain of keeping high standards in college sports has
unfortunately come to the fore recently. A few clubs have
undergone a crisis 'at the top' — let us hope these are all
resolved satisfactorily. Let us also hope that the landlords
of Knightsbridge are not further subjected to the 'locust-like'
incidents which occurred on the Wednesday night following
the cup matches—I.C. can do without this bad reputation!
ed but for the waywardness
of the forwards' shooting.
The first goal developed
after a short corner, and it
was finally Dave Richman
(Wonder-Boy again) who
scored with an easy chance.
He also had a hand in the
second when he received a
pass from the centre-half,
and after controlling the
ball, hit a perfect through
ball to the centre forward.
Pete Bates rounded the goal-
keeper and ran the ball into
an empty net.
The I.C. defence looked
solid in all positions, and
never looked harassed
throughout the game. The
final goal, following a quick-
ly taken free-hit was scored
by Dave Wilson, bringing his
season's tally to 12.
The semi-final of the U.L.
Cup is due to be played on
10th February against Guys
Hospital, but I.C. should not
have much trouble in reach-
ing the final.

I.C. played themselves in-
to the final of the Penney
Cup for the 4th year run-
ning, giving one of their best
performances vet this season
in beating R.H.C. 3—1, on
Saturday, 30th January.
After a hesistant start by
both teams, Royal Holloway
were the first to find their
G u t t e r i d g e C u p
Royal Free Hospital 6 pts.; I.C. 1st X V 21 pts.
On Wednesday, 27th January I.C. won through to the
semifinals of the Gutteridge Cup (of which they are the
holders) by decisively beating R.F.H. in a somewhat quiet
cup match. Most of I.C's. points were scored by their No. 8,
Clive Swinnerton, who kicked four prodigious penalty goals.
The I.C. backs, supplied by plentiful balls from their
hard-working forwards who ran hard and well, enabled
left winger Anderson to score twice to bring his tally for
the season so far to 18 tries. The other try was scored by
centre-cum-flanker Hunt, who turned in another fine display
of powerful running and hard tackling.
Scrum half Stephenson spun out his celebrated passes
(copied by a certain G. O. Edwards) even though hindered
by a beautifully rounded beer pot! The front row must
be congratulated on their tactical (?) intimidation of their
opposition—they follow in the long line of ham-headed
I.C. scrummagers.
I.C. now meet U.C. in the semifinal on Wednesday, 17th
February.

rhythm, but the pressure was
removed from a rather mud-
dled I.C. defence by a good
breakaway goal by Chris
Culshaw. The teams were
well-matched but only poor
finishing by I.C. prevented
them from being further
ahead at half-time.
Beyond doubt
However, early in the sec-
ond-half, some fine stick-
work by Hilary Rowson re-
sulted in her scoring the sec-
ond goal. Although R.H.C.
appeared to be losing heart,
they scored from a corner,
but a further goal by I.C.
shortly afterwards put the
result beyond doubt.
