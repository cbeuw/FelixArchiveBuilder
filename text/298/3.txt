February 11th, 1971 FELIX 3
EDITORIAL
N.U.S. with their £70 grant claim and their desire to abolish
the means test want to have their cake and eat it. Both
have very good arguments in their favour but with grants
already taking 5% of the total education bill, I think this
last will be considered very carefully by those in authority.
The suggestion to replace the means test by a selective tax on
high wage earners might well work could the change be
smooth and immediate. But there will certainly be objections
against the scheme from some members of parliament.
Still perhaps it's best to buy the philosophy that whatever
a student gets is rapidly taken away from him. John Som-
mers' report to council contains suggestions to raise hall
(and house?) rents by one pound a week which over the year
would swallow half the claim, even supposing it were com-
pletely successful.
FELIX, whose troubles came to a head at the end of last
term at last seems to be making some financial progress. Now
our problem is forming a practical staff for the next academic
year. There's much satisfaction to be gained in working for
the paper—the note on page 2 ought to be considered by all
I.C. students.

M e d i t a t i o n
Dear Sir,
For many of us, there is no intrinsic satisfaction in the
courses we take. We want more say in course construction,
we want to know and examine the relevance of our chosen
speciality to society, we want to establish our identities, and
a healthy relationship with our environment. We need a
sense of purpose to give us increasing fulfilment as we
proceed.
Our present education system falls far short of fulfilling
these needs and any education we gain is largely self-
acquired. We should be given a good start to life in all its
aspects, and not merely that of acquiring a technical skill
to get a good job.
S.I.M.S. could well have an answer in the system of trans-
cendental meditation, and everyone interested in sorting out
this problem should consider what the movement has to say.
T;M. is neither a system of contemplation nor of intel-
lectual titillation—ideas commonly associated with medita-
tion—and in view of this it is perhaps unfortunate to be
called such. It can be looked at in this way: Early astrono-
mers took the earth to be the centre of things and life was
difficult. Planetary motion could not be explained properly,
even with the help of complicated epicycles. Things just did
not fit in. It only required a subtle shift in the centre of
the 'universe' from the earth to the sun, however, to enable
the whole thing to be seen clearly. Similarly, through the
regular practice of T.M., a gradual shift in the centre of
attention occurs — quite spontaneously — from superficial
levels of mental activity towards the silent core of one's
being. We become more intimate with our real self—that
part of us from which every other part stems. And as this
innocent process takes place everything around us begins to
tit into place. We feel more at home with everything includ-
ing our studies.
Until we have a clear perception of what we are, then
questions like 'what is the relevance of this?' or 'how do I
fit in here?' cannot really begin to solve themselves except
at a superficial pragmatic level. For a satisfactory subject-
object relationship to be established, both elements must be
present in full.
To many people all this will seem meaningless and silly,
but astronomers before Copernicus, the idea of the sun being
the centre of the system seemed silly and meaningless. It
wasn't until someone actually put it there that he saw it
made things easy.
As with any complete system, the practice of T.M. is com-
plemented by a theoretical side, which though not necessary
for the practice, helps the understanding. For any rational
person, it is important that his experiences can be fitted into
an intellectual framework. To this end, and with a view to
helping solve the problems mentioned earlier, S.I.M.S. has
initiated a course of study entitled the Science of Creative
Intelligence, which could be introduced into college curri-
cula. This has been done with great success in a number
of colleges and universities in the States. The course is a
study of creative intelligence in all its aspects, including all
branches of learning and the writings of great men. Students
taking the course will be offered the practice of T.M. to
supplement the theory with direct experience. It would be
interesting to hear people's views on this. A lecture about
the course will be arranged later this term.
Yours sincerely,
Jeremy Bowler, Physics III.

Dear Editor,
I feel most strongly that one aspect of the present political
environment has been greatly ignored recently and I feel it
is my duty to bring it to the attention of your readers.
D-day will bring very few problems for students who
should easily cope with the conversion to New Pence. What
about those less able to handle two currencies at the same
time?
It only takes a little thought to realise that the decision to
go decimal is just another part of the Tory fascist plot to
deprive the workers of their hard-won freedoms. D-day must
be seen as intrinsically connected with the Anti-Union Laws,
student and academic restrictions, Law and Order, Social
Welfare cuts and the Dutschke thing. Only non-thinkers
can fail to see the rapidly developing spectre of Neo-nazi
oppression which is sweeping the country in every sphere as
fast as the Tories can bulldoze Bills through Parliament.
Are we going to allow ourselves to be trampled on? NO!
We must take action! Let us take this opportunity to rise
and show our solidarity with the oppressed workers.
Boycott the new Tory fascist money and bring the Tories
down.
Clive Willmott (Min. Tech. 1.)
STUDENT UNION AUTONOMY
Although it may not seem obvious S.U. autonomy will be
endangered by the precedent of the Industrial Relations Bill.
A registrar of S.U. (c.f. T.U. Registrar) has already been sug-
gested—requiring all S.U. constitutions and actions to be sub-
ject to specific government scrutinity and approval. The
Privy Council has also objected to compulsory S.U. member-
ship although provision exists for students to opt out on the
grounds of conscience (c.f. agency shops and no closed
shop policy). This indicates a change of policy because no
objections were ever raised to the charters of public sector
colleges and new universities which made membership com-
pulsory. Further hints—Patrick Wallup has questioned the
control of S.U. finances particularly on whether ultra pay-
ments are being made from L.E.A. money. This raises the
spectre of another, a clamp-down on students—all this and
"law and order" threats too.
Election of Deans
Despite long arguments the Governing Body has refused
to allow the students on the Board of Studies to participate in
the Deans election. The non-professional staff now can but
not students. Privy Councils reactionary stand clamping on
reserved areas has once again been used to "justify" unpro-
gressive policies. Once on the Board of Studies, Governing
Body and various others, student representation has been
brought to a halt. Staff-student committees are tolerated not
encouraged.
Architectural Association.
The Governing Body were adamantly against re-opening
or-even reapproaching the A.A.'. Our structure is perfect
—seemed to be the attitude so any moral responsibility was
denied. Although the college has little free money the Gov-
erning Body wouldn't consider even approaching the A.A.
to see if any other help was possible.
Fat Renting Scheme
The idea is that lots of us know of flats which are good
value for money—or just availabe. If the union could take
out say five year." leases and then let out to I.C. students. The
landlord if assured of five years of reliable (!) tenancy may
offer a more favourable rent. So watch for publicity next
term.
Hall Selection
Always a good stirrer. Changes in general selection policy
which would allow everyone to have one year in hall or stu-
dent house are being discussed at the College Student Resi-
dence Committee. In the past selection has been a pernicious
scheme based on a students usefulness to the hall or the un-
ion. The new policy would mean slight cutbacks in e.g. staff
and wardens' places. The number of re-applicants would
probably remain at about 12%. Council proved slightly re-
luctant to alter the number of ex officio union places. Com-
plicated details are available in last council's reports.
Sennet
Dear Sir,
Have we now gained yet another comic-strip of extremist
fantasy on the I.C. scene—well, so it would seem, judging
by the latest issue of Sennet. Who can deny that this paper
has now got a definite political slant to its reporting, which
seems only for the enlightenment of those with a Marxist-
Leninist philosophy? To make it yet worse, all the well-worn
cliches (e.g. force the Tories to resign), which I.C. delights
in howling down, with disgust, at union meetings, have not
only often appeared but are often repeated. Well, you may
say that any idiot could see this and no one takes Sennet
seriously anyway—it's just a sick joke! That may be a harm-
less enough attitude, but one can get a sick joke going too
far, which is a waste of time and money, and, further it
may alienate people not 'in' on the university-joke-scene.
This is a bad move, especially as we are trying a publicity
campaign to improve our grants.
All this you may appreciate but what you may not have
noticed, unless you read the unheadlined minor Sennet fea-
tures, is that London college unions will be asked by Sennet
for more money, for an increased number of issues per term.
Is this really on, if Sennet persists in its current wave of
biased reporting? Giving money to Sennet opens up the
whole question of I.C.U. giving money away. For instance,
at a recent union meeting it was proposed to give £50 to the
postal workers. Apart from the legal position of I.C. being a
charity (which York university seems to be successfully
circumventing) giving money to external bodies should not
be the general rule. This money exists for the welfare of the
student body, and to the encouragement of their social and
recreational activities.
So, dear people, take an interest in union activities and
watch where your money goes. More important, come to
union meetings and express your views.
Peace, goodwill, etc.,
John Hall, Physics 3.
