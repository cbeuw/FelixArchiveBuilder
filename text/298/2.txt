Hyde Park Relay Musical notes
Contrary to previous sub-
versive literature circulated
round the Halls, this year's
Hyde Park Relay will use
real live human beings. At
their own request and insis-
tence they will run the 2-
mile 1740-yard course on
paths round the Serpentine!
In spite of the Post Office's
attempts to disrupt the pro-
ceedings we have already re-
received 70 teams' names
Unbelievable

and with 6 in a team you
might care to compute the
energy expended — or better
still come and watch it . . .
Such is the reputation of
this event that teams from
Continental Universities
fiock(?) to compete with
most of the British Univer-
sities. Hence our appeal for
vacant rooms in Hall over
that weekend — if by any
chance you are going away
then please see Jim Botterill
(Garden 15) or Paul Clarke
(446 Tizard), if you have not
already done so.
Also we would be most
pleased to hear from anyone
who would like to help us as
a marker or tea-ticket col-
lector on the day as we are
rather short of manpower;
and after all — this is the
world's largest student relay.
Thanks.

Our future?
When the coming aca-
demic year is considered,
FELIX could well be in a
grave situation where staff
are concerned. Many of the
present staff are third year
and of course, won't be
around to help in the run-
ning. What's more, FELIX
is one thing that cannot be
run from the word "go".
Which is why people who
are considering staffing the
paper next year, ought to be-
gin now and gain the ex-
perience that makes produc-
tion considerably easier.
Effectively most posts on
the paper will be open so
people can work in what-
ever depth they choose. A
skeleton list of posts will give
some idea of the numbers
involved — Editor, Features
editor, Asst. editors (3),
Photographers (3), Business
manager, Circulation (2).
'QUADROPHONY' said
the poster in large letters. In
fact, what the hi-fi society
intended to demonstrate in
the Great Hall last Tuesday
evening was a method of
'bringing forward' normal
stereo sound by means of
additional speakers behind
the listener, putting out a
combination of the two
front channels. A selection
of records was chosen which
emphasised technical quality,
resulting in a wide range of
styles from Mahler to Zappa.
Compere was Andy Finney
(95.3 MHz) who unfor-
tunately found himself ex-
plaining that (i) this was not
really quadrophony, and (ii)
we were actually only going
to hear simple stereo, due to
a technical hitch. Perhaps
the ideal way to hear the
hi-fi is in a room in Weeks
Hail, although better things
are promised, including a
pop concert in aid of Carni-
val.
Something not represented
in hi-fisoc's programme was
folk music, which could
however be heard in live
form the following evening
at the folk club concert, star-
ring Hamish Imlach. Of the
musical societies, the folk
club is by far the most popu-
lar, for reasons which are
not difficult to understand.
The music is light-hearted
and easily understood, the
performers are talented,
there is audience participa-
tion (and its no, nay
never . . .), and there is a
bar provided on site (the
gents is three floors below,
but never mind). The corpu-
lent Mr. Imlach certainly
made the most of this atmo-
sphere, although 'ethnic' folk
enthusiasts were probably
somewhat disillusioned.

By popular request (the staff are frustrated) we hope to
organise a computer dating service (using a real computer)
in order to raise money for CARNIVAL and aid inter-USK
relations. As a result for only 5/- (which will go to Carnival)
we will supply you with your dream girl or boy, according to
your sex, and in case you doubt our chances of getting
enough girls we offer you an unrepeatable money back
guarantee that every applicant will be supplied with an intro-
duction to a partner and after that, as they say, it's up to
you. How do I apply you're asking with bated breath. Well
here are your instructions.
Firstly you complete the form on the opposite half of
this page (application forms are also obtainable at various
well labelled points around college), not forgetting to answer
each question honestly (it's in your own interests). Then cut
out the form and cut it into two pieces as shown. Place the
piece giving your name and the means by which your part-
ner is to contact you (part 1) in an envelope and seal it.
This envelope will be given, unopened, to your partner so
no one else will ever know that you applied i.e. YOU WILL
REMAIN COMPLETELY ANONYMOUS. Now place this
envelope together with part 2 of the application form and,
of course, a cheque, postal order or cash for 5/- (cheques
to "Imperial College Carnival Account") in another envelope
and seal it. Finally place this envelope in one of the collec-
tion boxes and for a mere 5/- arid two envelopes you will be
given the chance of a night out with a partner ideally suited
to your tastes (we hope). The collection boxes will be placed
near to the messenger desks in most college buildings.
Unlike many of the features in this paper this is not a
joke. We really want to help Carnival and our computer
experts are working extremely hard to make sure we also
help you, so don't be left out in the cold, apply now.
