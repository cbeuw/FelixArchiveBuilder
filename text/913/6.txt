Housing is a big issue. It affects
all of us whether we are in the
process o f seeking accommodation
or actually living in it. I C students
are no exception and the Union's
welfare office deals with an
increasing number o f queries on
tenant's rights each week.
M o s t n e w , private tenancy
agreements are now either Assumed

are regulated by the 1988 Housing

January 1989. Students with
agreements prior to this date may

two months notice to quit. This also
means that in a tenancy o f six
months' duration it is possible for
a landlord to give notice to quit after
four months and for this notice to
expire at the end o f the six month
period. T h i s means that the tenant
would have to leave after six
months.

Assured Shorthold Tenancy
It is likely that this will be the most
c o m m o n type o f agreement
landlords will ask students to sign.
A n A S T is an agreement which
allows you to stay in the property
for a specified period of time, the
minimum being six months. In
order for such an agreement to be
valid a landlord must give y o u a
separate sheet of paper stating that
the letting is o f an A s s u r e d
Shorthold type before you sign the
main lease.
Once the period of time specified
by the agreement is over, the
property can be repossessed by the

Students may wish to leave their
property before the end o f the
minimum six month period. Unless
the agreement allows for this or i f

landlord y o u will continue to be
liable for the rent until the expiry
of the m i n i m u m period. If you are
in this position seek further advice
from the Welfare Office.
Joint tenants (i.e. more than one
student signing a single agreement
for a house or flat) must give notice
jointly, although it is sometimes
possible to negotiate with the
landlord and get someone else in.
Y o u should bear in mind, however,
that the landlord can maintain the
current l e v e l for the w h o l e
property, regardless of the fact that
one person may have moved out.
For example, i f one of three joint
tenants leaves, the remaining two
may have to increase their share of
the rent in order to make up the
T h e tenant, likewise, is also
required to give two month's notice
of their intention to leave (less
notice is required i f the landlord
agrees).
Rent Increases
Once the rent is agreed on at the
beginning of an A S T the landlord
cannot raise it. A t the end o f the
fixed term, i f the agreement
becomes a P A S T the charge must
remain at the same level unless the
original contract contained a clause
allowing the landlord to review the
rent. Note that i f a landlord wishes
to increase the rent after an A S T has
expired and the tenants do not agree
with this, the landlord can then gain
possession of the property by
simply giving two months' notice to
quit.
It follows from the above that
students should try, if at all possible
to sign agreements that suit their
academic year and holiday plans. In
practice, this is rarely possible
though!
