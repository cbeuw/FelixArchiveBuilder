Grease —Opsoc & Dramsoc Filmsoc
Opsoc and Dramsoc are jointly
staging a production of Grease in
the Great Hall from January 28 to
F e b r u a r y 1 next y e a r . T h i s
promises to be one of the biggest
events of its kind ever seen in
college. W e need your help to
ensure that the production is a
success.
W e need a b i g cast (both
principals and chorus). Rehearsals
are already underway on Tuesday
evenings at 7.30pm in room 308 in
the H u x l e y B u i l d i n g . A t the
moment, these are just sing-
throughs with the score so everyone
can get to know some of the songs
even if you don't all know them
already! W e are hoping not to have
to audition chorus members but for
those of you who are interested in
a principal part, you must come to
one of these rehearsals to get to
know some songs and book an
audition time. There are some non
singing principal parts but you will
still need to go to a rehearsal to
book an audition time. Auditions
will be on Thursday 24 October
from 7.00-10.30pm and Saturday
26 from 1 l a m to 6pm, probably in
room 308 in the Huxley building.
O n the technical side, we are
going to need a lot o f help with set
building (starting this term) and
lights and sound next term. W e will
also need backstage help during the
production with costumes, make-
up, props etc.
The Grifters is a hard boiled thriller

Frankenstein
Joe Bodenland, a twenty-first
century American, passes through
a 'timeship' and finds himself with
Byron and Shelley in the famous
villa on the shore of Lake Geneva.
Having done this he then finds
himself face to face with a real
F r a n k e n s t e i n , a doppelganger
inhabiting a complex world where
fact and fiction may as easily have
congress as Bodenland himself
manages to make love to M a r y
(that's Shelley—she wrote a book
once and apparently quite a few
people read it, though it's title
escapes me at the moment).
A n y w a y that's what the book by
Brian Aldiss is about. Join I C S F
and come see what the film is about
(why not? That's why we're
going!), find out the meaning of
life, the universe and the chair-
entity's rocketing blood pressure. It
only costs £2.50 to become a

your first film free. Otherwise it
costs £1 for all paid up members
who have already seen a film this
