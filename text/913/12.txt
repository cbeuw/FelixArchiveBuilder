Drop Dead Fred Doc Hollywood
I have been told that experiencing
Rik Mayall is one of the finer points
of getting to know the English
mentality. I have seen Drop Dead
Fred twice now, once when I was
still in T h e States, and frankly, the
second time around it is terribly
tedious. This movie seems to have
been put together as a tool of
masturbation for dear old Rik. This
isn't to say that the movie does not
have some extraordinary strokes, as
it were, of genius, but it does get
a bit tiring after a while. There are
just so many pelvic thrusts for
emnhasis a viewer can take.
Having said this, I would like to
point out some of the finer points
o f this o t h e r w i s e e x t r e m e l y
mediocre movie. The supporting
actors add a decisive edge to the
film. Carrie Fisher, plays the role
of Best Friend that she perfected in
When Harry Met Sally. H e r
character is a new age corporate
l a w y e r . T h i s is w o n d e r f u l l y
expressed when she power walks in
search for her endorphic high with
a cigarette in hand and spouts
'Visualise! Visualise!' to her dear
friend Elizabeth. However, she
does seem to treat Lizzie as a child
when she indulges her 'imagination'
and tries to strangle F r e d , even
though he is quite invisible to her.
A l s o a bright spot in this film is her
c h i l d h o o d best f r i e n d . H i s
acceptance of her head problems
and even his attempt to join in on
the insanity is quite funny.
This is definitely a one-time see,
but only once, and during the
daytime please. I wouldn't want you
wasting an extra three quid. In fact,
see it on video; it should be ready
for release in the next month. R i k
Mayall can provide a laugh at times,
although these laughs do require the
intellect of a seven-year old to
detect, and the b r i l l i a n t
performances of the supporting
actors is enough to give you the
endurance to sit through the film.
However, if you like R i k M a y a l l ,
go see it for god's sake - it's made
just for you!

Michael J . Fox ! Teenage girls !
Fast cars ! Adolescent fantasies a-
go-go ! W o w , sit back and wait for
an hour and half of wisecrackin'
inimitable fun with the F o x !
Actually, it appears that M i k e y
has gone A D U L T and alas, that
means the movie's (wow, what a
great word ! movie's ! entering new
uncharted etymological territory
here ! Where possessives have no
meaning and the apostrophe is the
enemy of man !) also gone A D u L T
and that means, natch, that stuff
about R e L A T i o N S h l P S and
M o T i V A T i o N and S o U L
S e a R C H i N G have entered the
picture. A n d the picture is this : The
F o x is a whizz surgeon who's had
enough of helping the needy and
working his butt off and all that
stuff, so he's off to California to
earn him some big money on the nip
' n ' tuck market. O n his way, he
carelessly fails to spot a pair of
cows in the road (of the bovine
variety) and consequently drives his
Porsche Speedster (fast car ! fast car
!) into, the local judge's fence. Said
judge is not too happy and orders
him to perform community service
by way of recompense. While he
does so, gritting his teeth in
frustration, he meets a remarkably
uninhibited local lass, L o u , (Julie
Warner) and a variety of (very)
small-town folks. H i s car can't be
fixed because the locals tend to deal
in swine rather than pearls, so he
whiles away the time trying to lever
his way into Lou's pants and having
a few emotional medical sequences.
In the end, all comes out happily,
he warms to the place, etc. etc.
This is a deeply unsurprising
film, but it has enough quirks in it
to maintain interest; The Fox makes
the transition from bubble-gum to
A D U L T with a reasonable degree
of smoothness and generally the
whole shebang bubbles along
pleasantly. Y o u w o u l d n ' t be
throwing your money away.
The Flying Gerbil
The Rescuers Down Under
After only 14 years Bernard and
Bianca are back in a rip-roaring
adventure set at the limit of the
m i n d ' s e y e ' s deepest dreams
imagination. Okay, it's Australia.
T h e y ' r e out to rescue another kid
with negligible nose (why do
Disney kids have negligible noses?)
who has been caught by a nasty
poacher while rescuing fickle
animals. Pretty obviously, if you
saw the previous tale, the poacher
needs the child to get the treasure
(flipping huge eagle). Rather than
crocodiles there is a goanna lizard
who provides slapstick aplenty in a
menacing manner and the usual
b u n c h o f a m i a b l e v e r b o s e
marsupials. T h e albatross is back
(well his brother) and the romance
between lead mice is aflame. This
may sound rather like the first
movie, and some of it gives
uncanny deja-vu, but there is a new
action tilt. Possibly too much
action, with the brat coming so
close to death that he could read the
label on the reapers pants, and even
the emergence of Bernard as a
m a c h o h e - m o u s e . A lot o f
sequences can be seen to be
computer designed with smooth
f l o w i n g a c t i o n to i m m e n s e
precision. T h e animation is very
good (but not up to Little Mermaid
standards) and some of the voices
are well chosen. Bob Newhart gives
voice to Bernard, E v a Gabor to
Bianca, John Candy to Wilbur the
albatross, George C . Scott to
M c L e a c h the poacher and Tristan
Rogers to Jake the kangaroo mouse.
J a k e has the o n l y r e a l i s t i c
Australian accent in the film and
some of the accents really have to
be heard.
It's great. Really great. Super
smashing lovely. Bit short, but
really great.
