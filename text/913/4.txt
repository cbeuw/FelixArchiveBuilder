E v e r y second Wednesday, the
Lounge Bar hosts a bar quiz (which
started last Wednesday). These are
general knowledge quizzes with
alcoholic prizes and a chance to take
part in the 'winners' quiz near
Easter. T h e next one is in Welfare
Week, where y o u ' l l be able to
spend five days finding out how to
be healthier and hopefully survive
a few years here.
Next Thursday is C o m m e m o r -
ation Day. A l l last year's graduates
return with their gowns to pick up
bits of paper from the Albert Hall.
There are a few good points to this,
firstly you get to see how stupid you
could look in three or four years
time. Secondly, everyone gets the
afternoon o f f a n d finally the
commemoration ball disco is in the
evening. This goes from midnight
until 3.30am with a bar until 2am.
Tickets are £2 and available from
the U n i o n Office on M o n d a y .
O n the subject o f discos, i f
anyone wants a cheap but excellent
disco contact D o m i n i c and the Ents
kiddies via the U n i o n Office. Their
events, which will be publicised as
soon as they're sorted out, are jazz
nights and piano nights in the bar
and lounge bar, cocktail nights and
happy hours.
Elections
Being a students' union, we have
lots o f officer's posts. These are
filled b y students and give y o u
something to while away those
hours and get some C V points as
well. T h e following posts are
presently vacant and will be filled
through elections at the respective
c o m m i t t e e s : A t h l e t i c s C l u b s
Committee C h a i r , Recreational

can be obtained from the relevant
exec v i a the U n i o n O f f i c e
pigeonholes.
There are six other posts, elected
at the U n i o n General Meeting on
November 7. Nomination papers go
up o n the noticeboard (East
staircase, 1 level u p , U n i o n
Building) o n M o n d a y at 9.30am.
They come down o n Friday 1st
November at 5.30pm. T h e basic
idea is if you wish to stand then put
your name up and get proposed by
someone. Then find ten people to
second you (nagging people in the
bar tends to work). If nobody stands
by the time papers are taken down
then nominations are open from the
floor at the U G M . T h e posts
available are: 2 first year reps to
C o u n c i l , W o m e n ' s O f f i c e r ,
Postgraduate A f f a i r s O f f i c e r ,
Publicity Officer (artistic flair not
necessary) and Transport Officer.
If these names don't mean anything
to you, pop into the U n i o n Office
and grab a sabbatical to explain
what the jobs are about.
