They've done it again - Rag's
second event of the year was
another total success. There was so
much enthusiasm among all the
students that the d a y went
exceptionally well.
About 280 students took part in
the actual game of M o n o p o l y , but
the collecting began at midnight on
Saturday, with 38 students heading
for Leicester Square, to collect from
the people leaving the cinemas and
clubs. This went well and at about
M a n y of the students arrived to
register in fancy dress of varying
degrees of silliness and there was
even a team of eight excellent
singers who sang for money and
treasure. Every team had a name,
and these were fairly unusual at
times. Quoting W i l l Stallard, the
Rag secretary: 'I had to go into the
lounge bar and shout for teams to
start counting their money. Things
started to get ridiculous when I had
to shout for O G 2 Sex Kitchen. It

4 a m the group headed for
Smithfield Market. Unfortunately,
when they arrived, they found that
it was shut until Monday. They then
decided to make their way to N e w
Covent Garden Market. Five people
went by taxi and the rest made their
way by tube. Some decided that
they would head back and get some
sleep before Monopoly, and the rest
went to either the Elephant and
Castle or to Portobello Road
Market. Everyone was back at
college by 10 am to take part in the
M o n o p o l y , most without having
had any sleep.
took three attempts before I got a
reply out of them.'
Nearly everyone attempted the
M o n o p o l y clues (which some said
were too difficult), and everyone
managed to collect some money
along the way. A lot of people have
now raised enough money for a Rag
mug, and a few have even collected
enough for a Rag T - shirt.
Most of the treasure acquired was
done so legally, which made a
pleasant change from previous
years. Some of it was quite
spectacular. T h e items collected
ranged from the inevitable traffic
cones to restaurant menus to posters
from video and record stores to the
ultimate - the offer of a free disco
for Rag from a traffic warden. A
fair amount of treasure relating to
penguins was also brought back, to
the delight o f o u r c u r r e n t l y
voiceless Rag chairman.
Mencap organised a party at
K i n g ' s College (King's Road) for
everyone who collected for the day,
which included students from many
other Rags around the country.
Quite a few I C students went and,
apart from the expensive food and
drink, it was an excellent evening.
The winning team was T h e
Superteam which consisted of N i c k
A l l e n , Pete B o w e n , T a m s i n
Braisher, A l e d Fenner, Martin
Heighway and D e m i Jones. T h e y
were all part of the group collecting
through the night.
The final total raised last Saturday
was an amazing £8,290.72, which
almost doubled the amount raised
at last year's M o n o p o l y . This,
combined with the money raised at
the Tiddlywinking and the Rag
C l o a k r o o m s d u r i n g F r e s h e r s '
Week, means that Rag has raised
over £11,000 in only two weeks.
This is a third of the final total for
last year. A t this rate, Rag is going
to be unbelievably huge this year -
keep up the good work.
Hiya, it's Penguin the R A G
Chairman here again. R A G , for
those of you who still haven't come
across it this late into term, is
basically students raising money for
charity in the most fun way possible
('cause it's easier to raise money
that way). W e do it exceptionally
well at I.C., but this year has far
exceeded anyone's expectations.
With only two events gone we're
already almost a third of our way
to last years overall total! A s well
as that, this year we have more
people involved than ever before
and the fun atmosphere associated
with it is second to none!
L a s t S a t u r d a y was L i v e
M O N O P O L Y , at which we raised
a staggering £8,290.72, an amount
that I owe entirely to those who took
part. Everyone who participated,
even those who participated a small
amount had a brilliant day, which
is good because it means that I'm
doing my job properly.
Right, down to business. Seeing
as you're reading this during
Friday's lectures (like everyone else
in college) that means that there is
now less than 24 hours until the
third massive Rag event of term: it's
this Saturday (19th Oct) and there's
going to be literally hundreds taking
part (although that doesn't mean we
don't want more). It's going to be
fun, frantic, but a b o v e a l l ,
frivolous. It's called ' T h e Great
