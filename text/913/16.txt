Afro-Carlb Ban
T h e Afro-Caribbean Society could
soon be allowed to hold events in
the Union. Jonathan Griffiths, I C U
D e p u t y P r e s i d e n t , has been
approached by members of the
Afro-Caribbean Society who have
asked him to lift the two year old
ban.
T h e Bar sub-committee stopped
the society from using licensed
areas of the U n i o n as the society's
events 'attracted considerable
attention from the police.' M r
Griffiths suggested that the Society
held some events in non-licensed
areas in order to show good intent
before appealing to the Bar sub-
committee to lift the ban. A s it
stands, the ban extends to all college
rooms.

Round-Up
A motor-cycle was stolen this week
from the bicycle rack by the C i v i l

very concerned that people are not
taking care of their property.
A cash box containing £150 of
departmental money was taken
from an office in Mechanical
Engineering. T h e box had been left
in an unlocked drawer in an
unattended office. Terry Briley of
the security office told Felix that
people should 'not leave anything
unattended even for a short period
of time.'
A n attempt was made to steal a
brand new Ford Sierra from the car
park during working hours on
Tuesday. T h e thief opened the
bonnet to change the fuses but
'made a bit of a bodge' and was
therefore unsuccessful. N o arrest
has been made in connection with
this incident.

Vocation
Testing
The Committee of V i c e Chancellors
and Principals, the C V C P , have
announced that they want a broader
qualification than A-levels. They
say that traditional exams produce
too narrow an education and they
would prefer a vocationally based
test.
After calls to give students a
choice about whether to use animals
during practical sessions, the C V C P
have decreed that i n d i v i d u a l
departments must decide how to
treat the issue.
