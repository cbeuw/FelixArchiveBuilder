If you sign an agreement for a fixed
period of time and it is not an A S T
it is likely to be a F T A T . Y o u have
security of tenure during the period
of the fixed term and the landlord
must obtain a court order if s/he
wishes to repossess during this
period. Special grounds must be
proved before a court will evict a
tenant. If a landlord is trying to get
you out, seek advice from the
Welfare Office urgently.
Unless there is a clause in the
agreement about early termination,
it is difficult to leave a F T A T before
the expirty of the contract. If you
are in this position, seek advice.
E x p i r y of F T A T
Some agreements may stipulate
what will happen to the contract
once the fixed term expires. If this
is not specified, the tenant will then
b e c o m e a Statutory A s s u r e d
Tenant. A landlord may then only
repossess the property by court
order and must, in any case give
notice (usually two months). A
court can only grant possession
back to a landlord i f they are
satisfied that a particular ground (or
grounds) for possession exists. The
g r o u n d s for p o s s e s s i o n are
stipulated in the Housing A c t and
further information on these can be
obtained from the Union's Welfare
Office.
Deposits
Most landlords will charge tenants
a deposit in order to indemnify
themselves against unreasonable
costs arising when tenants leave the
property. O n some occasions
landlords will try to deduct money
from deposits or even fail to
reimburse them for no good reason.
W h e n paying a deposit you should
obtain a receipt from the landlord
which also stipulates exactly what
the money is for. In order to protect
yourself from possible future
problems regarding this it is a good
idea to follow the procedure
outlined in section two of the I C U
Housing Rights Pack. If, after
following these guidelines the
landlord does not return your
deposit seek advice from the I C U
Welfare Adviser.
I have tried to answer the more
c o m m o n queries about housing
rights. T h e above information,
h o w e v e r , is o n l y a g e n e r a l
introduction and not a full statement
o f the law. M o r e d e t a i l e d
information can be found in I C U ' s
Housing Rights Pack which is
produced by the Welfare Office.
Copies are free and are available
from the U n i o n General Office.
If you need advice on any housing
issue I can be consulted in the
Welfare Office which is situated
within the U n i o n General Office in
Beit Quad.

Schlum Companies Have It
Sooner or later, engineering graduates have to make a decision whether to stay close to the technology that
fascinates them and in which they have excelled so far, or whether to move out into management-style functions
which are perceived - often quite rightly - to be the most effective way up to the top.
In Schlumberger you don't have to face such black-and-white decisions.
Schlumberger operates a policy of promotion from within which means that all the senior managers (and we are
talking about all the way to the chairman) have come up from the graduate engineer level. While providing
unsurpassed management opportunities foryoung engineers, our system of careerdevelopment also means that
employees are not pigeon-holed or likely to experience one-way tickets into support functions. A typical career
in Schlumberger will lead in and out of technical, management and support roles, broadening experience,
providing a unique variety and building the strongest corporate management potential of tomorrow.
And while we are looking for the potential in our recruits to benefit from this philosophy, we do not compromise
on engineering expertise. Which is why we are market leaders in ourfour mainstream activities and are continuing
to invest in R&D with a commitment and confidence way beyond that of our competitors.
If you would like to know more about these careers which range from industrial engineering in some of the most
high-tech plants in the world, to field-based jobs supplying specialised technical services to our oilfield clients all
over the globe, please come to our careers evening in the Sherfield Building on 28 October at 6pm or contact us
directly by writing to:
