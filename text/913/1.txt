The Imperial College Careers Fair
a 'clearly well
planned' success
A n estimated 5,500 students
attended this year's careers fair
according to its manager, Jeremy
Burnell. A b o u t 70 companies
attended the fair which was held in
a marquee last T u e s d a y and
Wednesday on the Queen's L a w n .
M r Burnell expressed his opinion
that the companies were actually
recruiting rather than simply giving
a public relations display. He added
that in his view 'the fair was far
superior to last year' when there
was a large a m o u n t o f
disorganisation preceding the event.
T h e representative for Price
Waterhouse commented that the fair
was 'clearly well planned'. Procter
and Gamble said that it was a 'well
organised event' and M a r k E m e r y
of Rolls Royce claimed that the
whole show was 'very busy and
very impressive'. British Telecom,
who are presently seeking to recruit
about 500 graduates, described the
students attending as ' a b o v e
average' while Harbinder Dhaliwal
of L o g i c a said that 'the standard of
students is very, very high... they
are of a very high calibre'. She
added that of the 139 graduates
recruited last year, 20 were taken
from Imperial College, which was
more than any other establishment,
including O x f o r d , C a m b r i d g e ,
K i n g ' s College and University
College.
Some companies' representatives
expressed disappointment with
students. A m o n g these were
Banque Indosuez who felt students
lacked personality when compared
to last years eager job hunters. They
described the graduates that they
were looking for as having 'a
pleasing personality, a sense of
humour and the ability to look one
in the eye' while Bill Henderson
from Albright and Wilson Ltd. said
that 'most students were average;
there weren't many outstanding
ones.' M a n y companies, including
National Physical Laboratories,
said that they were 'looking for
somebody with a-bit of spark'.
Bill Fox of Imperial College's
Careers Advisory Service stated
that despite the recession and the
l o w e r n u m b e r o f c o m p a n i e s
attending in comparison with the
last fair, there w e r e s o m e
companies offering 'quite a few
more vacancies than last year'. He
added that the prospects for
engineering and physical science
students were 'a little m o r e
optimistic than I expected' and that
very few students from outside the
college attended the fair. M r . Fox
claimed that he could 'tell the
difference between a student from
outside the college and an I.C.
student by their hair and clothes, or
rather lack of.'
Holbein Slammed
Occupants of Holbein House are
complaining of its state of repair.
They say that desks and chairs are
wobbly and falling apart, wallpaper
is peeling off the walls, study lamps
are broken and wardrobe doors fall
off. A Holbein postgraduate told
Felix that 'we are expected to live
like squatters'. Jeremy Greenwood,
a sub warden in Holbein, said that
the conditions make studying very
difficult.
Sixty students live in Holbein,
which is a College owned student
residence in E v e l y n Gardens,
including many mature students and
postgraduates. The College plans to
close the Hall at Easter until next
session for renovation. The warden
of Holbein, D r Toumazou, was
unavailable for comment, but M r
Greenwood informed Felix that two
of the five showers were out of
order because they leak into the
rooms below. One of these was
reported to College at the start o f
the summer and the other at the start
of term. One of the rooms below
has been closed so the shower above
can be used. H e said that workmen
closed a shower last week, but have
since made no attempt to work on it.
T h e Hall has four ovens and a
non-functional microwave. M r
G r e e n w o o d said that three
microwaves were ordered at the
start of term with a promise from
College Estates to supply them in
a week. M r Graham Daniels,
Residences A r e a Manager told
Felix that a single microwave and
a fridge arrived yesterday.
Holbein residents pay Â£40 per
week, the same as other similarly
sized rooms in Evelyn Gardens. M r
Greenwood said T don't blame
anyone for complaining' as the Hall
is 'generally shabby' and M r
Daniels said that he is considering
Holbein a priority and will be
initiating a project to 'rectify major
faults in showers' throughout
College but admitted that 'faults
cannot be rectified overnight'. H e
promised to deliver new appliances
himself as staff were unavailable.
