I have been told that so far this
year, this newspaper has not been
tough enough o n the college
authorities. This may appear to be
true, but it is not because I have
been converted to thinking that the
Sherfield bureaucrats are jolly nice
people, but because I have not yet
received much information to get
my teeth into. It is not for want o f
trying.
Bits and Pieces
I have received some letters which
have not been signed by the author.
The latest was named ' C r o u c h
Rash', which I don't believe is a
proper name, though if it is I
BEER
FESTIVAL
20th November
I am now ordering the
beers for the 1991 beer
festival. If you have any
preferences, please write
them down and address
them to Richard Evers c/o
IC Rag or R C S Union by
30th October.
apologise. If you have submitted a
letter and it has not been included,
this will be due to one o f several
reasons; it was rubbish; it was not
signed by the author; or it missed
the deadline (Monday 12.30). I will
not guarantee the inclusion o f any
article, though I will do my best if
submitted before the
aforementioned deadline.
There is a dearth o f news in
college at the moment. C o u l d
somebody please go and make
some? A bit o f corruption in high
places generally goes down well,
though failing that, a nice meaty sex
scandal would be helpful. If nothing
turns up I will have to engineer
some news to fend off accusations
of being boring. This is not difficult
to do, though I'd rather not. I would
like to expand the subject area of the
news - including more national
stories relevant to I C students - but
this cannot be done until more
people are involved in news
gathering. If you would like to help
inform the college o f what's going
on, get involved in college media
- I C Radio, next to Southside shop,
S T O I C (television), on the top floor
of the U n i o n Building, or us in
Felix, in the far right hand corner
of B e i t Q u a d . T h e three
organisations should be able to pool
their news, so it would benefit
editorial
everyone if you were to join any
one o f them.
Articles solicited and unsolicited
on any subject are welcome to
Felix, provided that they are signed
by the author - the name does not
have to be printed, but I need to
know as the editor.
No time like the present
This issue is somewhat smaller than
usual. This is because:
a) I ' m not getting much sleep due
to being horribly overworked and
b) A l l the printing has to be done
by 5.00pm o n Thursday. A t the

time o f writing I can guarantee that
this won't be managed.
O h , the tribulations o f being a
newspaper editor. I shall stop this
wittering immediately as I am being
severely distracted by the disco
going on next door.
