Chaim Velial: Live?
I have a strange feeling that this tape
is a bootleg. N o t only a m I not
surprised by this, I ' m actually
rather proud o f it. So there. I
personally feel there is something
rather disquieting about the whole
ethos o f little or unknown bands
playing live sets consisting entirely
of cover versions. These days it
takes a really e x t r a o r d i n a r y
contribution to even merely add
something to, let alone record the
This Picture
definitive version of, ahem, a
' c l a s s i c ' . O f those that have
succeeded, I can think o f three,
maybe four, off the top of my head.
Sisters of Mercy's version o f Hot
Chocolate's Emma, The Fail 'doing
a job' on The Kinks' Victoria, Nick
Cave's cover o f E l v i s ' In the
Ghetto, and possibly Scott Walker's
heartbreaking rendition of Jacques
Brel's // You Go Away. F r o m what
I hear, Chaim Velial make a point
of c o n f u s i n g their a u d i e n c e ,
sometimes playing sets entirely
original, sometimes just covers. D i d
I say 'Just Covers'?
T h e vocalist, mysteriously known
only as 'Matthew' opens this
remarkably good recording with a
tribute to 'a son of the city', a cover
of Marc Almond's Mother Fist, it's
ornate chamber orchestrations
replaced by a lurid haze o f dive-
b o m b i n g guitar a n d Sadean
malevolence. In the background,
f o r e g r o u n d , F U C K I N G
E V E R Y W H E R E , an awesome
state o f total groove. E v e n before
the sculptured feedback has been
twisted 'round on its final axis, the
drumbox kicks into action for a
white noise trip through Madness'
' M i c h a e l C a i n e ' that is truly
b e w i l d e r i n g . T h r o u g h o u t the
swirling chill o f growing then
decaying sound are woven choice
pop icons; Primal Scream, Big
Black, Prince, Adam & the Ants,
the whole spectrum including
Einsturzende Neubauten and Steely
Dan. Jesus Christ, they even cast a
shadow over Sisters of Mercy's
Train. With a list like this, I ' m
occasioned to wonder wherein lies
their sense o f the absurd - it's
obviously there, i t ' s perfectly
bloody mischievous, but its location
is damned difficult, so genuine, so
often, seem their sentiments - but
this is a minor point with which to
c o n t r a d i c t so m a s s i v e a
performance. F u c k , but I wish I'd
been there.
This extraordinary show is closed
with, and I quote, a homage 'to
Year Zeros'. Chaim Velial, such a
serious 'arty' name, proceed to
lampoon (and harpoon) the entire
-world with a razor-sharp, sheet
metal maniac o f Dead Kennedys'
Holiday in Cambodia, every one of
Jello Biafra's sneers reinvented with
an astounding menace. T h i s is a
mighty and frightening experience;
I can't wait to see them.

-Tom's Album
Deep in Manhattan, on Broadway,
lives a small diner. T o m ' s . DNA
open this album with a remix o f
Rusted Pipe from the Days Of Open
Hand album, included as a bonus
track. The then follows the original
version, plain, sparse, barren,
adjective, and then this album gets
seriously warped. A version sung
in German, a completely unrelated
rap sung by N i k k i D . using the
" d e p de do d e p " bit skulking
around the background, and then
Waiting At The Border which is a
quiche pastiche on the subject of the
gulf war, George Bush and all. It's
quite funny. T h e n there's the first
low point, a reggae version. O h
well, turn it over. Italo-house,
something excellent about / Dream
Of Jeannie. Remember that. N o ,
neither did anyone else in my flat.
But I do. It was this 60's series
about a genie, and.. .The next track
is a rap rewrite, and it's quite good
as far as rap could be. Then there's
a Swedish version, moins de la
DNA backbeat, and then off to the
Borderline, for REM's (Bingo)
Hand Job doing a very silly version
about n o t h i n g , the o r i g i n a l
instrumental, and DNA's smash,
which is where we started. T o o cool
for words.

-A Violent Impression
There is a definite Irish feeling to
this record, be it the lilting vocal,
the subtle pipes and violin or the
soft mellow melodies, anyway you
look at it you see a clover leaf. I'm
not going to compare them to other
Irish bands, that's unfair on them
and on you. This is good mellow
stuff that occasionally rocks out a
little to get your feet tapping and the
mind racing.
It all makes me feel like riding in
a convertible with the roof down
rolling along a quite country lane,
the wind in my hair and not a care
in the world. It makes you feel
happy, jolly and, well there's no
thesaurus so add a word o f your
own. A s for the words, they're
English and make about as much
sense as a parrot on speed. A s far
as I can tell the main topic o f
conversation is love and the general
illquality o f what is available. A
typical topic but as they say, 'the
old ones are still the best'.
The guitars mix perfectly with the
mood, and the light drum in the
background add to the mellow
a t m o s p h e r e rather than
overpowering the slower more
moody tracks.
A l l good stuff.

Forget-Me-Nots
-Live at the South Bank Poly
Voice Of The Beehive play South
Bank poly, shock!! A n d only a
week after nearly playing here.
Despite o u r beloved L o n d o n
Transport setting fire to a train at
Elephant and Castle, I found m y
way to the industrial style bar with
a fine selection o f lager. In clouds
of dry ice out come two girls, who
I will call Michelle and Eithne,
instead o f Tracey and Melissa,
because, for the second time i n a
week, I have a suspicion that this
is not in fact a pair o f West coast
yankees (in the noose), but instead
some Irish people. They bring with
them three lads, and sing about
supermarkets, and other such things
in a sweet and lovely way.
And, on record, what are they like
on record? Sweet and lovely, again,
in a poppy kind o f way, and the
Beehive in them creeps into their
lyrics. C o m p a r e a n d discuss.
'There's a man in your bed and he's
asking your name' (Forget-me-nots,
Girl) ' H e ' l l wake up in the morning
and say, 'who the hell are y o u ? "
(Voice Of The Beehive, I Say
Nothing) But so what if they sound
similar? A t least they don't sound
like Chapterhouse. Forget-me-nots
are dreamy and soft, and when
Eithne sings 'Turns my light oh oh
oh o n , ' I begin to feel that maybe,
just maybe, this is a truly wonderful
record. Forget-Me-Nots, I think I
love you.
