Sightseeing Challenge'. Be There!
O . K . so I suppose you want to
know something about it. Well how
do these prospects grab you:
(i) Mugging tourists to find out
how many bedrooms there are in
Buckingham Palace.
(ii) Y o u and your team building
a human pyramid outside St. Paul's
Cathedral.
(iii) Y o u and your team finding
a pint of Thames water without a
pint glass, in L o n d o n at this hour!
W e l l these are all challenges that
you may or may not come across
on Saturday's Great Sightseeing
Challenge. Let me explain further
T h e G . S . S . C . is yet another fun
day out for all the family (?), but
of course being Rag, trying to raise
as much money for charity (in
tomorrow's case, U N I C E F ) as
possible in the process. T h e aim is
for your team- of 4 to 6 (so if you
haven't got one together yet do it
now) to complete the course in the
time permitted, hopefully having
collected some money en route.
T h e route will take you around
about 9 of London's greatest sights,
so if you're new in town, or you just
want a fun day out come and join
us. Everybody's welcome (whether
you've done any Rag events yet or
not). A t each sight your team will
have the choice of either:
(i) A Quick Question
(ii) A Physical Challenge
(iii) A n On-the-Spot Scavenge (as
above), only after having completed
one of these can your team be told
where the next sight is. If at any
point your team can't fulfil the task
chosen you can change task, but
you will incur a penalty. T h e team
completing the route with fewest
penalties are the winners. In the
event of a tie (quite likely with
nearly 50 teams), the winning team
will be the one with the highest
amount collected. Easy? T r y it!
There will be prizes for the top
five freshers only teams (although
veterans are more than welcome) as
well as other prizes for top
collectors and our usual incentive
scheme for the • amount raised
during the year : £50 = Free M u g ,
£150 = Free T-Shirf and £300 =
Free Sweatshirt. So if you've
already done T i d d l y w i n k s or
Monopoly you're well on your way
already. U N I C E F are also giving
prizes for best individual totals, but
as with last week, there's loads of
other Rags from all around the
country coming down, so the
competition is high. This does
however mean that the party being
.held here by U N I C E F in the
evening should be a stormer
Register from 10am to 12am in
Beit Quad. T h e marshals will be
returning at about 5.30pm, so the
sooner you start the better chance
you will have of completing the
course!
So, be mad, be silly and be part
of it!
Lastly, there have been vicious
rumours flying about that the loss
of my voice is entirely 'a Rag stunt'
and that I 'must be raising loads for
charity doing it'. W e l l , for anyone
who I haven't already 'written it
down' for, it's not and I'm not!
Thus I apologise for not having
leapt in front of any lectures or
being very talkative if you've
b u m p e d into m e this w e e k .
Hopefully my voice will have
returned by the time you get round
to reading this or by today's Rag
meeting, in the U n i o n Lounge at
12.40pm, to which everyone's
welcome, could prove even more
fun than usual.
Penguin, Rag Chairman.
P.S. Rag W e e k starts on 15th
November. This year it's going to
be very big, so start thinking of
what you, your clubs, your hall,
your friends and your pet antarctic
monochromatic flightless waterfowl
can all do for it. A n y ideas
w e l c o m e . Please contact m e
a.s.a.p. via the Rag pigeon hole in
the U n i o n Office.
