Nine Inch Nails The Pixies
-Trompe le Monde
This band supported Guns N'
Roses. I'm also given to believe
Simon (yes, you know the drill...)
'Bates' has played their latest single
on Radio O n e , not that I listen to
Wankspeak, y o u understand. What
is most surprising about this band
is that they bear more relation to,
say, Ministry, Front 242 or a well
fuckin' 'ard Depeche Mode than G
N'R. Not that they're any less
miffed.
The aforementioned single, Head
like a Hole is the opening track on
this re-released l.p., and is sleek
and brutal, in fact, a veritable
corporate assassin of a song. It's
Progenitor is a something of an
angry man going by the name of
Trent Reznor, and as a vocal
analogy, you might care to imagine
The Exorcist with InXS Michael
Hutchence replacing Linda Blair.
F r o m a purr to a growl of synth-
hook that's as velvety and elegant
as it is menacing and aggressive,
Head like a Hole is pure pop
bubbling away in a cauldron full of
malevolence. Reznor's lyrics and
delivery set him firmly in the ivory
tower prison camp for social misfits
('The Devil wants to fuck me in the
back of his car and there's nothing
quite like the feel of something
new'). A s a se'er of the world, he
hardly sports rose-tinted shades, but
v e r y o c c a s i o n a l l y , I get the
impression that even he isn't
convinced by his vision herein.
M a y b e it's down to the poppy
quality he' imbues his voice with,
which makes the prospect o f Nine
Inch Nails even more alarming than
Perry Farrell, AI Jourgenson or
even, god forbid, Jello Biafra.
A s for the rest of Pretty Hate
Machine, it's nervy enough; broken
up rhythms and eerie melodies
embellish a fine slab of industrial
funk to the point where this could
rightly be considered a very
promising debut. Terrible Lie is
eminently freaky, as is That's what
I get, both taking the skeleton of
punk, coating liberally with highly-
p o l i s h e d c h r o m e a n d t a k i n g
onboard the gleaming demon of a
cyberpsychosis. Never is this more
apparent than on the bizarrely
beautiful 'Something I can never
have'. This is sick, unholy shit, but,
as Reznor says himself with more
than a modicum of pride, ' M a y b e
I'm all messed up'. Yeah, right.
M a y b e I am, too.

F o r some strange reason about to
be recounted, I'm not thinking
about The Pixies right now. N o ,
I'm thinking about twat musos and
their phallic egocentricity. I'm
thinking about scum-sucking rock
n ' roll virtuosity, notes-per-second
etc. I ' m thinking about J i m i
Hendrix and the legions of wankers
he unwittingly spawned because
Chapterhouse
-Mesmerise
Pearl may have been may favorite
track from ' T h e Scene' as the press
would call them, but this comes
close third. A massive chunk of
noise is mixed with a vocal that
lurks menacingly below the surface,
ready to p o u n c e o n any
unsuspecting listener.
It flows along like lave on a
carpet, sticking like glue to anyone
or anything it can. A t stages it
appears to die, only to re-emerge
like, well something that re-
emergeges, full o f life and ready for
action.
O n the flip is another remix
where they appear to sample
themselves (that gets around the
legal problems, good thinking) and
this time the vocals are definitely
relegated to the third division. T h e
pure noise and energy takes over
and the enjoyment begins. People
might complain, 'and where's the
music?', well isn't music al about
enjoying yourself?
Pebbles
they didn't understand what he, and
what rock n ' roll, were about. H e
did. So does Charles ' B l a c k '
Francis of The Pixies. Rock n ' Roll
is a primal thing, articulating for the
inarticulate gut instincts, fear and
loathing, obviously, desire and
aggression. Rock n ' R o l l is not
about high art, but it is at once
surface and symbol (thanks, Oscar).
W e intellectualise rock n'roll at our
peril.
So now, after deftly avoiding the
obvious, I'm going to talk about the
Pixies. It has been remarked that
Francis' interest in the cosmos
amounts to nothing more than
' F u c k , man. A i n ' t space huge?'
while heavily stoned. I might
suggest it's a little more than that.
' B o s s a n o v a ' was loaded with
spacey imagery, and ' T r o m p e . . . '
takes it further. They still use those
odd rhythmic twists and jerks in
their blunt but effective method of
engaging the listener, so much so
that this s y n o n y m y c o u l d
conceivably metamorphose into a
bizarre self-parody, but it has to be
said that there is something
stylistically heavy rock about
' T r o m p e . . . ' . ' V e l o u r i a ' , f r o m
'Bossanova', had a similar power
chord structure to a lot of these
songs, 'Sad Punk' and ' U - M a s s ' in
particular, but the harsh, punky jolts
and Francis' eerily sweet voice
maintain their glorious pig-shit thick
stubborness. Their cover of The
Jesus and Mary Chain's 'Head O n '
flogs the original to death, by the
way. This is a very cool record, and
one I strongly advocate ownership
of, but don't kill for it. 'Planet of
Sound' et al, keep Pixies at the top
of all sharp and bitching pop at the
moment, but we all know pop is an
art form. Thanks again, Oscar. A l l
art is useless.
