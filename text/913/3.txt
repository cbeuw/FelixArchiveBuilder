The Phoenix is a legendary Arabian
bird which would arise anew from
its own ashes; it is also the name of
the Imperial College arts magazine.
The Phoenix of legend was reborn
every five hundred years; the
Phoenix of I.C. appeared a little -
but only a little - more often. E a c h

Indeed, the last sighting was some

about to be reborn and it needs
people who will nurture it and assist
in its development. In short, the

he had absolutely no fear, only

Once inside the noise settled
