1 Felix 913 Letters
Bailey's back and Naff letter of the
boring as ever week
Dear Adam,
R e — C h r i s t i a n O u t r e a c h last
issue.
I wondered if my fellow students,
who are members o f the Christian
U n i o n could tell me what has
happened to forgiveness in the
doctrine of the Church o f England?
I'm talking about the case of Rev
Tyler who was kicked out of his job
because he could not resist 'the
temptations o f the flesh' from one
of his female parishioners. T h e
church court's reasoning was that
he behaved in a way 'unbecoming
to his position', a sort of bringing
the game into disrepute I suppose!
H e comforted his parishioner after
a bereavement in her family, and
continued to give her a serious
comforting on a regular basis.
Apparently they were going at it
like rabbits for twelve months, and
you could say he took the laying on
of hands a bit too far! C o u l d this
have been based on the Gospel o f
Sexual Healing according to M a r v i n
Gaye?
W h y a m I writing this letter?
Well in a church in East London the
local vicar publicly pronounced that
he is not only gay but also carries
the A I D S virus. H e says he can't
understand why G o d has given him
this disease. W e ' r e going to have
to let h i m work that one out for
himself. But will this geezer be
charged with 'bringing the game
into disrepute'. I think not.
The Rev. Tyler, who was kicked
out of his family home and given
the elbow by the church, must think
himself u n l u c k y . Perhaps the
Christian U n i o n could explain this
to me, because it seems that if Rev
Tyler had interfered with one of his
choir boys, collected funds for the
I R A or campaigned for the release
of the 'Renault 5' then he would
have been forgiven.
Yours as always,
Alan Bailey.
Dear Adam,
I just wanted to enquire about the
stress you must be under. I suppose
it must have been stress to call the
Science Fiction society ' F i l m S o c ' as
you did in 'What's O n ' last Felix.
Y o u even left I C S F in the message
itself. But what's more, in the same
issue, y o u printed an article about
the film in which I C S F was mispelt
as T C O F ' . T h e S o c i e t y o f
OmniFiction?
C a n I ask whether you are going
to m i s p r i n t ' F r a n k e n s t e i n
U n b o u n d ' — a film based on the
story by Brian Aldiss? Shown by
the Imperial College U n i o n Society
o f Science Fiction, Fantasy and
Horror. Taking place on Tuesday
October 22, 7pm in M e c h E n g 220.
T h e cost will be £1 to members who
have already seen one of our films
Dear Editor,
I would wholeheartedly like to
agree with your proposal to change
the name of Felix. Personally, I find
the manner o f ex-IC students who
automatically ask after Felix, as
though it were a fixture and fitting
of college life, painful almost to the
point o f being patronising. In these
times, when the government is
running the further education
system so liberally, I see little point
in m a i n t a i n i n g s u c h t r i v i a l
connections with O l d Centralians et
at.
A s for the new name, try the
sound of 'the imperial college
this year. O r £2.50 to join and see
the film.
Yours,
Alex McLintock, ICSF
Chairentity.
This is one of the most pathetic
letters I have ever seen. It speaks
volumes on the state of mind of
an I C S F trainspotter that they
think the universe shakes at the
misspelling of one of their entries.
I do not have the time to proof
read everything but since M r
McLintock finds typographical
errors so obscene I now elevate
him to Typographical E r r o r
Editor, and he is now responsible
for organising proof-reading in
this office. Henceforward any
complaints of such errors must be
directed towards him.
Adam.
newspaper' as being suitably low
key thus preventing a situation
similar to the present one arising in
another fifty years. T h e use of little
letters is deliberate so as to fit with
your 'editorial' heading (I would
suggest that in the interests o f
consistency y o u write all your
headlines in lower case). Finally, in
case people should worry that this
would detract from the relevance of
Felix T h e Cat, he could always be
renamed ' T h e imperial college
newspaper cat'.
Yours faithfully,
Daniel Shields, Elec Eng 2.
P.S. Keep up the good work!
