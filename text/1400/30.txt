Medics netball pull away from IC
3rds to take the victory
The game got off to a great start even
though half the team were shattered
from the game before!
The first quarter was going well with
the game neck and neck and everyone
playing superbly. Quarter time score,
8-8. As the tension grew in the sec-
ond quarter the Medics pushed ahead,
leaving the Imperial team wanting it
even more. The score was 12-17 at half
time. Hopefully some half-time orang-
es would help.
But then in an attempt to score a
marvellous goal, the Imperial Goal
Shooter, Fee Larner fell valiantly to
the floor with cramp leaving the Med-
ics once again proving they know less
about medicine than a media student
at Bradford!
Unfortunately for Imperial the goals
just weren’t going in and the Medics
began to greatly increase the goal dif-
ference in the third quarter, leaving
the scores at 14-28 with 15 minutes
to play. This made the Imperial team
more determined than ever so entering
the final quarter, a little red in the face,
they began to win their centres back. It
was too late though as the Medics had
already stormed ahead.
Finally, the buzzer went, leaving the
scores at 17-34! Although Imperial
was left a little disappointed, we were
pleased with our fight against a team
two leagues above. A brilliant effort by
all those who played!
Medics draw first blood against IC 4th
We arrived at Ethos at 12 p.m. ready
to play at 12:30. You could feel the ex-
citement as supporters from the other
teams started to pile in. We wanted
to get the game started ASAP so that
all the games could finish earlier and
then we could all get to Richmond on
time. However, the Medics were hav-
ing none of it.
Eventually, the game got underway
with competitive debuts for Amrita
Randhawa, Sarah Jane, and Tina Flana-
gan. In the first quarter, the shoot-
ing looked a bit rusty for both teams,
which left the scores 3-3 at the quarter-
time whistle. With some outstanding
inter-play between centre Fee Larner,
WA Amrita, and GA Charlotte Gra-
ham, IC had just pulled ahead by half
time – the score 6-5. The third quar-
ter didn’t quite go to plan with IC only
scoring one goal. Maybe it was all the
oranges we ate at half time – left our
hands a bit juicy! The score was 7-10
with 10 minutes to play. Unfortunately,
the Medics experience showed in the
last quarter to leave it at 10-15. But one
thing you do have to remember is that
the Medics 4s play competitively every
week in ULU and we do not – so not a
bad result in the end for us! After the
game, we settled in for an afternoon of

This sea-
son has been
a success
all round on
the netball-
ing front. We
started the
season with an excellent
fresher intake, with new play-
ers slotting into all four teams.
The first team had to adapt to
more travelling and a higher
standard as they had moved
up into the 1A division, the
season overall was a great
success, finishing in a com-
fortable third place and pro-
gressing to the BUSA trophy.
The second team built up a
strong team spirit through
the season and have ended
up finishing the season in
ULU a lot higher than previ-
ously and will be starting next
season with a good chance of
promotion. The thirds played
well throughout the season
and were always secure with-
in their league. They formed a
tightandwell-rehearsedteam.
The 4th team played their first
season in ULU and competed
well and all improved greatly
throughout the season.
Varsity day arrived with
much anticipation – round-
ing off the netball season
with a large dose of patriot-
ism and rivalry. The four-hour
marathon of games began
with the 4ths, the ICSM team
only in its second year but
proving they had grown as a
team and fought all the way
through to win 15-10. Next
up, the 3rds: after a close first
half the medics then broke
away, with impressive shoot-
ing skills and a solid defen-
sive trio leading them to a
final score of 34-17. The 2nds
game was always going to be
close, with the medics only
beating IC by a goal earlier in
the season. The defence on
both sides working continu-
ously, the scores were even
until the last quarter, when the
medics finally pushed to suc-
cess, the final score a close
but well-deserved 24-21. The
climax of Netball varsity was
the first teams match. Read-
ers of Felix are constantly
updated by news of IC Net-
ball’s unbeaten season and
with the medics holding onto
their place in the BUSAs 1A
the match was always going
to be very tense. IC came out
strong; showing their inten-
tions very early on with some
well-rehearsed feeding into
the circle and lots of support
across the court. However,
the medics weren’t going
to let the match go that eas-
ily and showed their fighting
spirit and dominant presence
across the court. The medics
defending pair worked con-
tinuously hard to break down
the IC attack and by the last
quarter the difference was up
to seven. The medics shoot-
ers continued to put away the
goals and centre court stayed
strong linking all the play and
the medics managed to hold
off the last IC surge to win
42-38. The Medics were once
again victorious – winning all
four matches!
