Watch out! Change is coming!
On Monday, a paper is being submitted to Council to help ensure Felix can report on news important to you
Kadhim Shubber
On the front of this newspaper are
two token protests, barely visible to
the casual eye. The symbol of Felix,
the cat, has been gagged and also the
word ‘newspaper’ has been changed
to ‘news’paper. On Monday the Union
Council will discuss a paper submitted
by Tom Roberts, Felix Editor. Unlike
the token protests on the front page,
this paper will help ensure that Felix’s
editorial freedom is protected and by
removing ambiguity within the rules
governing Union publications, allow
greater freedom in reporting news
that is of interest to Imperial’s student
body.
In the Union Constitution, Felix is
described as an independent student
newspaper that is ‘Editorially Free’.
However, there are two main reasons
why this in practice is not always the
case. Staff-Student Protocol and Elec-
tion Regulations override, rightly or
wrongly, the editorial freedom of the
Felix Editor. However, I concede that
the Felix Editor should operate under
certain rules. Felix does not exist in a
bubble and there are definitely respon-
sibilities that come with Editorial Free-
dom. But because these rules are for the
most part to be interpreted, editorial
freedom in certain cases disappears.
Content is sometimes decided, albeit
indirectly, by the Union. Importantly,
the interpretations can unfortunately
be wholly inconsistent with a free press
and reporting in the public interest.
I would not suggest that the Union
President has direct control over the
content of Felix, and I’m certainly not
supposing that the Deputy President
(Finance and Services) controls wheth-
er or not Felix is published. However,
Felix is part of the Union and is fi-
nanced by the Union. The President,
as head of the Union, has a responsi-
bility for the Union’s activities. If the
Union were to be sued because of a Fe-
lix publication, we would ask what the
President knew and what he/she did to
avoid getting into a legal mess.
According to Election Regulations,
no story may be published on an indi-
vidual who is standing for election; a
story must be about all election candi-
dates or none at all. “A candidate could
come into the Felix offices and smash
up the computers, and we wouldn’t be
allowed to report on it”, commented
Felix on 15th February. This restric-
tion on free speech is not justified, as it
is detrimental to the elections. Student
voters should be given information
that is relevant to their decision mak-
ing and certainly the misdeeds of an
election candidate is important
to voters. I agree that public-
ity shouldn’t be given to a
candidate over others;
however, I disagree
that this means
that the mis-
deeds of a can-
didate should
not be
reported.
There is
no doubt
that the
Sabbati-
cal Elec-
tionsheld
this year
were suc-
cessful.
Turnout
and par-
ticipation
were rela-
tively high
and unlike
previous elec-
tions, the word
farce was nowhere
to be seen. This was
of course due to the en-
thusiasm of the sabbatical
candidates but also because
there was a determination within
the Union that the elections should
pass smoothly. Therefore, in this case,
the Union President’s interpretation of
the electoral regulations was cautious
and focused on avoiding controversy;
it was judged that a smooth election
was more important than the publica-
tion of certain stories. This is a deci-
sion that should be made by the Felix
Editor; again we see that the room for
interpretation within the constitution
removes editorial decisions from the
Felix Editor. It is not the job of Felix to
ensure that the elections pass smooth-
ly and certainly this should not be a
deciding factor when choosing stories
that are in the students’ interest.
The world of the Staff Student Proto-
colisalegalminefieldbutthisjusthigh-
lights the need to remove ambiguity
and introduce clear but fair guidelines
for
Fe- lix. Im-
perial College Union is an employer,
and all employers have a duty to pro-
tect their staff. However, the Union is
different to most employers, as it has,
supposedly, an editorially independent
student media. This creates pressures
that other employers do not experi-
ence, such as protecting its staff from
harassment by fickle students while
also respecting the right of the student
media to report factually in the public
interest. The Staff Student Protocol is
supposed to tackle this complicated
issue, but it fails to do so adequately.
The balance cannot exist presently.
An over-cautious sabbatical team will
always choose to enforce the SSP in a
draconian manner and therefore de-
grade the freedom of the student me-
dia; a more lenient sabbatical team,
which we may have next year, will be
more willing to let some stories be
published. The variability is
damaging to the credibility
of Felix as a student news-
paper. The motion pro-
posed by Tom Roberts
intends to remove
this variable inter-
pretation to SSP
andthereforeen-
sure that SSP is
used fairly, re-
sponsibly, and
consistently.
With these
things in
mind, cast
your mind
back to the
Felix issue
with the blank
front page.
The issue pub-
lished on Friday
15th of Febru-
ary contained
three stories that
were interpreted by
the Union President
Stephen Brown as vio-
lating Election Regulations
and Staff-Student protocol.
The interpretation that he made
was a cautious one and certainly Mr
Brown would not deny this. He then
advised the Felix Editor that the pub-
lication of the articles would probably
result in the impounding of Felix (this
means that the issue of Felix would be
confiscated and distribution would
be stopped). Why didn’t Tom Roberts
ignore the Union President? Student
news website Live! published 2 of the
3 stories in question, in an article and
on a discussion board, in defiance of
the Union’s advice. Firstly, Felix and
Live! use different mediums. Whilst
an article on Live! can easily be re-
moved, the issue of Felix would have
been impounded, and around 40 pages
of content, of students’ effort, would
have gone to waste. Secondly, there are
more appropriate ways to make your
voice heard, without wasting your con-
tributors’ effort, namely the aforemen-
tioned paper to the council.
Let me make myself clear: It is not
the relationship between the Union
and Felix that is abhorrent. There is
nothing intrinsically damaging about
the President advising the Felix Editor
on the likely consequences of a publi-
cation. It is the interpretative nature of
the rules governing Union publications
that is damaging and it is this that the
paper successfully tackles. It re-words
the rules so that it is clear what Felix
can or can’t publish, what will or won’t
get Felix impounded and ensures that
the Felix Editor must only live by these
rules, not also by the interpretations of
a cautious Union President or a zeal-
ous election candidate.
The failings of Union departments
and election candidates are in the stu-
dent interest and should be reported
upon. There is a problem with the reg-
ulations regarding the student media;
they are subject to the interpretation
of people with interests other than the
reporting of news. As a result the stu-
dents of Imperial are deprived of infor-
mation that is important to them. This
cannot continue if we are to maintain
the credibility of Felix as a ‘newspa-
per’. It is not wrong that the Union has
token involvement with Felix or that
there are regulations; it is wrong that
the Union has the power to choose the
interpretation of these regulations.
“Felix shall be
editorially free
to operate and
report on events
as the Editor
sees fit”
