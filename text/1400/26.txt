Rainbow shines as medics fall to Imperial 2nds
As the IC football team rolled off the
bus on a mild February day in West
London, the air was filled with the un-
mistakable stench of IC Football vic-
tory. Not even the most optimistic of
the Medic Snouts could have predicted
a lucky draw; essentially they were be-
ing marched to their doom much like
the Burmese army towards John Ram-
bo and a semi-automatic. The sweet
anti-British chimes of the Wolfetones
and continuous simulation of gunfire
reduced the proverbial Medic pack-
age to a floppy 2-incher and a pair of
mincy balls.
Pete Cunt’s selected team set out
to ridicule the Medic Seconds. The
pre-match team talk fused the finest
aspects of culture and street justice,
quoting the ‘Art of War’ and the essen-
tial ‘How to beat the 4-4-2’. The start-
ing line-up spawned few surprises,
and after all the preparation we had to
live for something or die for nothing.
IC immediately seized the initiative
by dominating the centre of midfield
with a series of uncompromising chal-
lenges, showing no mercy towards The
Nurses souls. The endeavour of the
midfield coupled with the energy in
the forward line brought by the ‘White
Lightning’-quick Rainbow and Swain
resulted in the inevitable. The resist-
ance of the Medic back line swiftly
crumpled in a fashion reminiscent of
the British Army against the Irish Re-
publican movement; after good wide
work by “Kassabian the Turk” the ball
dropped to “The Frog” who duly deliv-
ered a lighting bolt right through the
upper-90.
Rainbow proved to be a constant
blade in the side of the Medic’s neck.
The IC backline on the contrary were
relaxing, enjoying ice-cold brewskies
and drinking up their superiority over
the Medic McLovins. Despite their
dominance they couldn’t convert op-
portunities and the pressure to double
the advantage grew as the half drew
to a close. IC’s 2nd XI, however, live
by the motto ‘When you’re pushed,
scoring is as easy as breathing’ much
like killing someone, and when a deep
corner was whipped into the box “The
Bearded-Oyster” headed the ball goal-
bound for “Dewy” to bundle past the
ham-fisted Medics.
The champagne was ready to be
popped until a moment of madness
from the IC keeper. An innocuous
free-kick was speculatively driven long
towards the box. Blinded by the sun
and distracted by his huge testicle the
ball bounced over Aubergine (soon to
be victim of a filthy pint) and into the
net. The team entered half-time some-
what subdued but confident of victory
against the wank obstacle they found
before them. Captain Cunt instructed
us, “true heroes never die, they just
reload,” and following some refresh-
ments from Master’s mum, the lads
were ready to do some more damage.
The second half proved to be an ex-
hibition of complete control, the Med-
ics rarely crossed the halfway line, with
“Lobster” keeping their winger firmly
between his pincers. Rainbow con-
tinued to throw his weight around up
top and was unlucky not to get on the
end of some fine midfield play from
Shaaz. Cue the introduction of 6th
team giants Adrian “Bus Fornication”
Doyle and “The Sex-Pest” Killer to fi-
nally wipe this dog shit from our shoes.
Flamboyant work from Gui ‘The Fave-
la Bellshiner’ allowed him to swing a
ball in for Killer to shank to Doyle who
sniped the ball goalward.
The rest of the game was played out
at a canter with ‘Pink Taco’ penetrat-
ing the Medic rearguard with surging
movements. The game fizzled out and
the final whistle was met with raptur-
ous screams from the mediocre rats
that made up the Smithy and Fitz
fanclub. Fitz, unimpressed by com-
parisons of his face to a vagina, requi-
sitioned ‘swaliberta’ from the rats and
destroyed it. After a quick consultation
it was decided that the medics were
too shit to merit a warm down, and we
should go support IC 1st XI.
Another year
sees another
football varsi-
ty retained at
a canter. The
Medics put up
a good fight
for 45 minutes of the 1st XI
clash, but in the second half
class told and we turned on
the style to score some excel-
lent goals and simulate exqui-
site gunfire. The 2nd XI clash
was treated with comical
contempt with leavers from
the 3s, 4s, 5s, and 6s playing
and winning comfortably. A
notable performance came
from 4th XI captain and cen-
tre back Aubergine who was
playing his first ever game as
a goalkeeper. His only contri-
bution was to watch the ball
bounce over his head and
into the goal. “Give the med-
ics a chance,” he thought. J.
E. Rainbow was sent off with-
in 20 seconds of his 1st XI de-
but for general skulduggery.
“It was worth it and I’ll do it
again” he muffled through his
balaclava.
Congratulations to the 1st
XV rugby too, you actually
made it competitive! The 1st
XI train rolls on to the Cup
Final this Saturday looking to
retain our trophy once more.
The trident is ready, the firm
are armed: the trophy awaits.

Medics no match for Imperial’s finest
After deciding that the Fagel Medics
were below their grade last year the
first team decided to humour the scum
this year. Rumours of a silent confi-
dence and a chance to get one over the
best team in London were on the lips
of the Medics.
Reports were circulating that the
Medic Captain was seen collect-
ing Disability Living Allowance just
last week. IC Captain Pat ‘Chipmunk
Head’ Farr told his troops to give the
Fagel an early goal – rumours that
this was the result of a payoff from an
Iranian match-fixing syndicate are un-
confirmed. Nonetheless the wankers
took the lead with a shanked shot off
Torossian’s scrotum before agonisingly
trickling through the lettuce wrists of
“Whore”.
Despite this setback the ULU champs
showed little urgency and were con-
tent to keep possession and poke fun at
how bollocks the opposition was. Sami
Typhallus then began to exert his effi-
cient form of dominance administering
fatal bouts of Bolivian SuperAids (The
Bad Type). Burkinshark’s first half per-
formance seemed subdued as he spent
most of it on the phone to multiple
American rats. Despite the contempt
towards the game the equaliser quickly
came, the DLA Medic Captain lost
possession to “Shadow the Hedgehog”
Howson, who calmly strolled through
and finished allowing the teams to en-
ter the half level.
IC’s Skipper delivered a passionate
team talk informing the lads that the
earth needed to be warmed with the
sweet wine of Medic blood. Aulak,
whose blade is sharper than Rambo’s,
was ready to dance, and dance he did.
A four-goal second-half ensued with
utter dominance being stamped over
the face of the opposition. Things got
embarrassing as ‘Fanny Batter’ Wil-
son and ‘Benny Boy’ Payne pulled the
strings through the centre while “Ego”
Martins ripped the medics to shreds
down the flanks. The unstoppable red
river flowed and the medics continued
to leak goals at the rear as the Irvinator
completed his hat-trick either side of a
Typhallus goal. The IC 1st team really
started to take the piss when “Burkin-
shark” passed the ball forward.
4-1 signalled the entrance of Wel-
lington DaSilva for his first team debut
allowing Haugh a short stint up top. In
what was otherwise a good game for
the ref, he harshly red-carded DaSilva
in less than 10 seconds. Responding to
remedial banter from a dirty stinking
Medic snout DaSilva politely informed
the individual that he would have to

see a proctologist if he kept slabberin’.
Later questioned about the incident
DaSilva responded, “I’d do it again”.
Despite this, Martins placed the icing
on the cake with a well-finished goal.
Afterwards, the Medic winger who
controversially switched allegiances at
the start of the year gave no comment
about the game.
Jack “The Crane” Britton did not
break a sweat all game, and questioned
the validity of the competition, re-
marking, “Maybe next year it would
be better if they played a Fagel IC team
like Wye or RSM.” Sport Imperial may
be looking into the possibility of this as
a more realistic varsity challenge.
Yet another Imperial goal going in
