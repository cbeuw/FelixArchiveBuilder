Higher Education Funding
Survey Prize Winners
Earlier in the term hundreds of you took part
in a survey about the role of Universities
in society and how they should be funded.
This week the Deputy President (Education
and Welfare), the Felix Editor and I drew the
winning students with a little help from an
online random number generator.
The winners are:
First Prize: Jennifer Van Griethuysen
Return Tickets to Paris for two on the Eurostar
Second Prize: Danielle Rozycka
Two West End Theatre and Dinner Vouchers
Third Prize: Elizabeth Williams
Two Open Dated Thorpe Park Tickets
Fourth Prize: Jérémie Mercier
A Crystal Experience Gift Voucher
Thank you to everyone who participated in
this exercise. The results of the survey have
been synthesised and discussed at length by
several of your elected representatives and
the final policy document will be discussed
and amended for the last time at Union
Council which is taking place on Monday
evening in the Union Dining Hall. Imperial
College Union’s new draft policy on higher
education funding is now available on the
meetings pages of the Union website and if
you are keen to contribute to the debate on
Monday evening then please come along for
a 6.30pm start.

Teaching and Teaching Fellowship scheme

Easter Carnival this
Wednesday
It’s Carnival time again! What better way to
end the term than a great party at the Union?
We are joined by T4’s Alexa Chung back from
her great Centenary Ball appearance. We also
have a giant slide in the Quad which is sure
to be an unforgettable part of the evening!
All this for only £4, that’s half the price of our
usual end-of-term parties! Tickets are online
now, see you there.
London Nightline survey
London Nightline, a charity run by students
for students and supported by Imperial
College Union is doing a survey to develop
their service.
The survey will only take a few minutes to
complete and there is a prize draw at the
end! Your help would be greatly appreciated
and would ensure we can make Nightline
better for all students in London and the
surrounding areas.
