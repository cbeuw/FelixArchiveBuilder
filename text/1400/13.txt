2007 Champion. £4.99, Milk chocolate egg with box of
Guylian sea-shells
Fonzie: A classic! A king egg amongst peasant eggs.
Shubber-de-do-wop: Hmm. Not as good as Thorntons.
Sinclair: Good egg. After eating so much chocolate I feel like
I’m going to throw up, but I don’t blame the egg.
streboR: Still the King as far as I’m
concerned.
Not-Casey-Affleck: Protest vote
against the incumbent! It’s good,
but let’s open up the field by
punishing this lack of origi-
nality. Plus, who thought of
chocolate molluscs?
Egg: ★★★★✩
Extras: ★★★★★
Value: ★★★★★
£3.99, Milk chocolate egg with relevant chocolate
products and a mug.
Sinclair: Filthy ghetto chocolate. Poor show.
Fonzie: Disappointing, violent, hurtful. Or something.
The mug is appreciated though.
Mckizzle: “Eat me!” it shouted. I did.
The Paw: Predictably tasty but the Yorkie
lacks the meaty taste of the bar.
Little Man Az: Chocolatey but too
sweet. My throat hurts now!
Hannah-backwards: Nestle chocolate
tastes almost as bad as Cadburys.
Egg: ★✩✩✩✩
Extras: ★★★✩✩
Value: ★★✩✩✩
£3.99, Plain chocolate egg with plain chocolate
droplets.
Skeeter: I like the wrapping but there should be a
toy... inside... I feel... a bit... sick.
streboR: Tastes surprisingly close to chocolate even
though it’s made of cardboard and my dad’s freshly
shaved-off stubble.
Yu: Not bad but nothing special.
Not-Casey-Affleck: Free from everything
including taste.
Dan-The-Wan-And-Only: Bit plain. That’s
probably why it’s called a plain chocolate
egg...
Egg: ★★✩✩✩
Extras: ★★✩✩✩
Value: ★★★✩✩
£4.98, Belgian milk chocolate egg with sticky toffee
chocolates
streboR: The fuck. This chocolate tastes tinged with
the Devil’s seed. Lily O’Brien should go back to cook-
ery. Or whatever.
Mckizzle: Lily O’Great!
Shubber-de-do-wop: I’m going to hunt
down Lily O’Brien and give her a hug.
Hobag: As rich as half of the Imperial
student population.
The Paw: Tastes like pubie salad with
Seth’s own dressing!
The Poon: The toffees aren’t sticky at
all. Misleading packaging... tut.
Egg: ★★★✩✩
Extras: ★★★★✩
Value: ★★★✩✩
£1.49 each, Eggs relevant to the brand
with equally relevant single extra
item.
Hobag: Full of despair like Sheffield in
the Winter.
streboR: Milkybar... as safe as houses.
The Paw: Why would you bother?
Not-Casey-Affleck: I wouldn’t be seen
dead on a cross eating these eggs.
Hannah-backwards: As soggy as a
granny’s underwear! One for the
grandchildren you don’t see too
often.
The Poon: Very sweet. I couldn’t
eat an entire egg in one go.
