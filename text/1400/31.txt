Not taken as seriously as some of the
other matches, but joining in the fun
we played a 7s game against each other
with left-over players on the side line
showing their support through alcohol
consumption.
IC started the match with Carla Mu-
las kicking off. A series of scrums lead
to IC regaining the ball only for it to
be stolen by Medics then pushed into
touch. The line-outs were generally
won by medics due to a clear height
advantage. The Medics had some good
rucking and mauling but when it even-
tually got out to the backs there was
some good tackling by Rebecca Har-
rison and Roxanne Crossley from IC.
The first try came from a turnover ball
by IC passing right through the hands,
ending with Carla scoring and convert-
ing a try. Half time 7-0 to IC.
A few minutes into the second half
IC got a penalty, kicked by Roxanne;
Elena Bailey made a tackle on the line
leading to another IC try by Roxanne.
Rugby girls have a fun and light-hearted game
With last year’s varsity competition be-
ing won by a single goal, this year both
teams had a point to prove. The match
started at a fierce pace, with a series of
squandered counter attacks from ei-
ther side, leaving the score goalless at
the end of the first period. IC had the
majority of the chances, the woodwork
denying the home team the lead.
The medics came close to scoring
with a series of long range shots; how-
ever, the Imperial keeper made some
impressive saves to deny the visitors
a place on the score sheet. The dead-
lock was broken midway through the
second period, with IC scoring a well-
rehearsed goal from the centre forward
position.
From this moment the match took a
major turn, the home team stringing
together a series of break away goals.
Imperial’s defence was solid, not al-
lowing the medics to get a grip on the
game. Just before half time John Live-
sey got the medics off the mark with a
superb shot finding the top-corner.
Vera Gielen showed excellent aware-
Medicals left dead in the water by IC
ness in the third period, scoring a
hat trick of goals in quick succession.
This was followed by scores from Ian
Welch-Philips and Richard Thoburn,
taking IC into an 8-1 lead with one pe-
riod remaining.
The final period continued with
much of the same, IC having the ma-
jority of possession, scoring two more
goals, taking the final score to 10-1.
The medic team were unlucky not to
score more, the final score slightly flat-
tering the IC team. However, this was
still a superb result for IC, with their
best ever score line in the varsity com-
petition, with every member of the
squad playing a vital part in the team’s
success.

In the last
four years the
water polo
team has
undergone
some dramat-
ic improve-
ments. After a year and a half
of nomad-like existence trav-
elling from pool to pool, the
team finally settled at Ethos,
with an impressive 14-match
home winning streak.
The introduction of former
GB coach, Adam Walzer,
proved a major turning point
for the water polo squad. Last
season the team won no less
than four trophies, including
the UL Tournament and Var-
sity Match, a superb achieve-
ment considering the team’s
mid-table position only three
years ago.
This year marked Impe-
rial Polo’s entry into BUSA.
A confident attitude saw the
team promoted into the pre-
mier league in their debut
season, narrowly missing out
on a place in the trophy final.

This season
theICSMcame
3rd in the ULU
League whilst
maintaining
its slogan “the
drinking team
with the water polo problem”.
The fresher intake has been
superb, and an extra Wednes-
day training session has al-
lowed us to develop from last
year. The boys have had an
extra opportunity this year,
combining with IC to form a
joint team in the BUSAs, it
was a great success with the
team getting promoted to tier
one.
The ULU league has been
tough, but despite this we
have managed to win five out
of the ten matches played, an
improvement from last year.
Varsity was as always highly
competitive and, although
the score line doesn’t suggest
it, was a closely fought match
on both sides.
Although the League is now
over we still have our consult-
ant’s match to look forward
to and the summer dinner to
come. This season we have
remained positive and are
looking forward to next year!

The Virgins
have had one
of their best
seasons yet
this year. In a
sport where
most teams
struggle just
to get 15
players out each week, the
virgins not only had 15 play-
ers for each match, but we
even managed to have subs!
Our first match, after only
one week of training, we won
50-5. Following that we had
the UH 7s tournament which
we came out as grand slam
winners. It was a great, but
quite easy start to the year.
Our first proper test came
against UCL, a team who
battered us last year. But we
came out victorious in a close
21-17 win. All in all, well done
girls!
Bonnie and Carla taking the
lead as Captain and Vice. I’m
going to miss you guys, but
good luck!

Medics had some good play and Jessica
Alcena was able to run around IC to
score a try for the Medics. To end the
match Becky was able to run through
the Medics and score the final try.
It was a very evenly matched game;
the play was good by both sides in what
was a fun and light-hearted game! Well
done to the freshers on the Medic side.
Good (in most cases excessive) drink-
ing fun was had by all while watching
the remainder of the games! Clearly
most of the virgins cannot handle 6
hours of drinking and by the start of
the Richmond game were in a state of
disrepair: with heads in bowls of chips
and sharing vodka outside stations
with tramps.
