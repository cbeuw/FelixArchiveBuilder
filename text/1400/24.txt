1sts play Varsity/ULU Cup final double header
All square between Medics and IC I thought
that this year
ICHC would
have to put
up more of a
fight to retain
the Varsity
Cup, which has been drunk
from by IC legends while
generations of Medics have
attempted to aspire to the IC
god-like standard!
The Ladies’ 1st XI started
out by annihilating the Medic
Elite (6-2), the Ladies 2nd XI
snatched a narrow victory
(2-1) and the Men’s 2nd XI
then decided that, after the
demolition of the Ladies’
Medics, they had better leave
some male compatriots to
pick up the pieces (a score-
less draw it finished)!
The Men’s 1st XI complet-
ed their season with a win
against the Medics in the ULU
cup final and were once again
making sure ICHC were the
owners of the Varsity Trophy.
The Ladies 1st XI narrowly
missed out on a 4th succes-
siveULUChampionship;how-
ever, the Men’s 2nd XI won it
once again! Other highlights
of the year include the Men’s
4th XI being promoted out of
the bottom ULU league and
the Men’s 3rd XI narrowly
missing out on promotion in
both ULU and BUSA.
We hope to see you all at
Presidents Day 2008

With all the other IC teams playing
their Varsity games on Wednesday
the Mens 1st team felt more than a lit-
tle left out. Due to national BUSA cup
commitments up north in Sheffield it
was all we could do to make it back in
time for the rugby at Richmond.
A good dose of Medic abuse therein
and a very strong run of games in the
BUSA cup meant that on arrival at
Chiswick, IC were in confident mood.
This game was to be played as a dou-
ble-header with the victors taking not
only the Varsity crown but also the
ULU Challenge cup trophy to boot. In
fact, IC had three teams representing
in cup final games.
The Mens 2s wrapped up their tie first
despite the best efforts of Mrs. Fat-n-
Slow and her husband umpiring. The
Ladies 1st had a much harder time
of it but made an excellent showing,
eventually losing out narrowly to GKT
in their cup final. Any disappointed
faces were soon buoyed by Roxy who
brought iced sponge cake and smiles
aplenty.
And so back to our game. Usual
scene, really, IC were incredibly awe-
some with magical skill, eagle-eyed vi-
sion, and masterful composure in pos-
session. The medics cheated, fouled,
and scabbed their way back from 2-0
down to draw level at 2-2 just minutes
before the final whistle blew. Moments
of note include Cornish crying off to
the bench because he was knackered,
Phoetus trying to take off by swinging
his stick around above his head heli-
copter style and nice-boy of nice-boys
Nick Jones getting sin-binned twice in
one match. Watch out, ladies, he likes
to get down on the turf and swing his
tackle from behind. Dirty.
And so it went to a penalty shoot-out.
Most went in, some missed, Joe didn’t
really try. Sach livened it up by saun-
tering up to the spot, waving kisses to
the crowd, and then he decided that he
didn’t even need to take his flick and
walked back. It even went to sudden
death p-flicks. I don’t even know how
because we really were leagues above
the Medics but we just sort of played
them along for a while; it’s good sport
you know. Alex momentarily parted
himself from his picnic basket and
with all the cheek of a young chimpan-
zee he pointed to the exact place where
he was to fire home his flick. Too easy.
So then they missed, Crusty scored,
and we won.
We collected our cup, our women,
and the medic’s pride and got back on
the coach to the half-price curry house.
It’s really half price you know.

The seemingly drab scoreline hides
what was probably one of the most
exciting Varsity matches. There was
a brief delay to the start whilst a ram-
bling, crazed man, inexplicably dressed
(badly) as a golden chicken, was re-
moved from the pitch. Once the poul-
try was cleared the game could begin
– and what a game!
The first half was tight. Nugget, hav-
ing provided some excellent pre-match
banter with the aid of a traffic cone, was
defending solidly. He was ably assisted
by Oedipus and Cheeky both playing
out of position at defensive centre-mid
yet admirably filling Superpiss’s shoes.
Chances were being created at either
end with Dyke and Lovechild combing
particularly well down the right wing
for IC.
In goal Biggsy, having just returned
from a broken back after his parachute
didn’t open sky-diving (no joke), was
on fire. It was still 0-0 at half-time
and the crowd was only getting big-
ger, more drunken and louder. Keeno
had finally arrived to provide extra
firepower upfront. Surely a goal must
come from somewhere?
The second half was even more fre-
netic as both sides searched for a goal.
The Beast started making some fright-
eningly forward yet effective runs from
left-back, linking well with Guff. They
were creating chances, as were Dyke
and Lovechild down the right. HeShe
and Blob were providing great link
up play between midfield and attack
and Blob and Refugee both had great
chances.
However the medic’s keeper was
having as miraculous a game as Biggsy
whose only balls-up was redeemed
with the season’s wunder save.
There were goalmouth scrambles at
both ends with balls dribbling agonis-
ingly wide and being swept off the line.
The last five minutes were manic with
two crazed sets of supporters scream-
ing every time the ball moved vaguely
in the direction of the opposition goal.
However, in the end no amount of run-
ning from Refugee (and there was a
lot) could produce a goal and the IC
defence remained solid – even old man
Featherlite broke a sweat. Ultimately,
the result ensured IC retained the Var-
sity hockey trophy. Job done!
