Y
ou may be slightly shocked
or even disgusted at this
week’s behemoth. Never
mind: 1400 issues and the
last week of term merits a
special effort. Hope it appeals to those
among you with strong stomachs.
The winner of last week’s crossword

thanks to all those who have sent in so-
lutions this term. Especially Di-Emma!
Happy holidays to you all, good luck
with your exams, and I hope to irritate
you again come summer.
