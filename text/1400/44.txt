Organic what in my TV?
Richard Lai talks about how this new screen tech will make a difference to you
A
pologies for the lack of a
section of last week but I
was enjoying myself with
coursework too much to
tear myself away from it.
Anyway, let’s see what is on offer from
the world of tech as we head towards
the end of term.
The games console accessory maker
Nyko has beat Sony to the release of
a rumbling Playstation 3 controller
dubbed the Zero PS3. Sony can’t be too
happy about this as they finally gave in
to consumer pressure to release the
Dual Shock 3 only to be beaten to the
post. But in reality, I don’t think Sony
have to much to worry about as the
Nyko is a flat-out fugly product so I
think very few people will stray from
the official controller.
A western state of Germany has re-
called its subsidies to Nokia after its
failure to meet the conditions set in
the agreement. The money was to help
fund Nokia’s manufacturing plant to
constructed in Germany and was sup-
posed to provide 2,800 jobs to the area,
however, Nokia plans to close the plant
in the next few months much to the an-
noyance of the people who have paid
for it. They have requested the initial
money back plus interest producing a
sum of €59 million which if not paid
will be replaced with legal action.
A bunch of clever hackers have pro-
ducedamethodofconvertingstreamed
BBC iPlayer media into the H.264 for-
mat required by the iPhone and iTouch
as they do not support the widely pop-
ularized lite media format Flash. Steve
Jobs explained this as “Flash is not up
to the standard of the iPhone” roughly
translated as “The iPhone can’t run
Flash very well”; where the blame falls
I think we can decide for ourselves.
Admittedly, these hackers seem to
have wasted their time as an iPlayer for
these devices has been in the works for
a while now.
America and Germany have drawn
up an agreement to merge each of their
biometric criminal databases in an at-
tempt to catch international criminals
and terrorists. Once again the two
standard sides to the argument emerge,
invasion of national privacy against
“screw them they’re criminals”. In rela-
tion to this, rumours have appeared of
a worldwide database being construct-
ed but nothing firm is available.
The Nokia N96 mobile has been con-
firmed for August. This phone is an-
ticipated by many a UK user as it will
be the first mobile to have a TV tuner
built in. For more depth you can find a
preview of it in a previous issue of the
tech section on the Felix web page.
Battlefield laser guns have come a
step closer to reality as Northrop, the
US military’s main tech supplier, have
tested a 15 kilowatt laser and have
plans for a 100 kilowatt model deemed
powerful for combat. These weapons
are originally being intended for use
as anti-missile and anti-air rather than
ground-to-ground as air targets tend
to be more vulnerable.
Unfortunately only one article this
week, the final issue of term, but need-
less to say it’s a good one covering the
evolving new technology of Organic
LED displays.

N
ow that the HD video
format war is over (well
done, Sony!), it is prob-
ably time to think about
next-gen TV. Currently
it is predicted that this year LCD TVs
will net 50% share of the TV market
(in which 58% will be full HD), but
this does not stop the development of
any new display technologies. As we
speak, the most promising candidate
appears to be the organic light-emit-
ting diode (OLED) display technology.
Here is a brief introduction of OLED:
as far back as the 1970s, Eastman Ko-
dak discovered that certain organic
materials glow in response to electri-
cal currents, and a variety of related
technologies emerged from that point
onwards. In fact, our very own Profes-
sor Donal Bradley, Head of the Depart-
ment of Physics, was one of the inven-
tors of the polymer LEDs (PLEDs) – a
type of OLED technology, and today
we are able to apply that to display
applications. Although the finished
OLED panel may look similar to an
LCD, the structure differs: from top
to bottom we have the cathode, emis-
sive polymer layer, conductive polymer
layer and anode, with the entire struc-
ture laid on a substrate such as glass or
even plastic. To operate, a current is
passed between the electrodes, which
causes the electrons in the conductive
layer to move down to the anode. This
leaves holes (absence of electrons) be-
hind which then recombine with the
electrons in the emissive layer above,
causing a drop in the electron energy
levels and thus releasing energy in the
form of light (through the substrate).
Such process is known as electrophos-
phorescence, as used in all LEDs.
Comparing this with LCDs, OLEDs
already have several advantages: as
mentioned above, each OLED pixel
controls its own light and can therefore
produce true black thus boosting the
contrast ratio, but LCDs – which work
by blocking light in selective areas –
require a backlight across the panel,
meaning they cannot show true black
as some light is bound to leak through.
As well as wasting power and making
the panel thicker; another difference
is that an LCD requires two polarisers
and a colour filter to operate, thereby
restricting the viewing angle as well
as blocking light and increasing thick-
ness, whereas an OLED needs no fil-
tering so it has none of those problems.
Other advantages of the OLEDs in-
clude faster refresh rate, greater colour
range, longer lifespan (as promised by
Panasonic and Toshiba last January)
and – perhaps most important of all
– the ability to be printed onto flexible
substrates, allowing applications that
are not possible with LCDs.
Currently the biggest problems with
OLEDs is their manufacturing meth-
ods: with Eastman Kodak holding the
patents other companies are financially
restricted for development, so even the
giants like Sony and Toshiba will have
to increase the prices to make up for
the initial expenses. More worryingly,
the fact that the organic materials can
be easily damaged by water makes it
hard to justify the prices, as well as
putting doubts into the practicality of
flexible OLEDs, but we can assume
that advanced sealing processes will
be used – after all, we are in the 21st
century.
As we speak, the only OLED TV in
the market is the Sony XEL-1, cost-
ing you about £950 in Japan or about
£1270 in the US (we all know that the
Japanese keep the best to themselves).
And no, it’s not even an HDTV or a
40”; a mere little 11” baby that gives
you 3mm of sexiness and a ridiculous
contrast ratio of 1,000,000:1 (most
LCD TVs in this price range can only
do about 10,000:1). It really isn’t the
size, mate, but only if you can afford
it. Fortunately, you can experience the
OLED goodness in smaller forms with-
out burning holes in your pocket: since
OLEDs have a much simpler structure
than LCDs, they are ideal for making
small displays, so you will find them
in several new (pricey) digital camer-
as, premium mobile phones, or some
new portable media players such as the
Creative Zen stone. If you don’t mind
monochrome displays, selected design
watches will also have OLED panels –
you can spot them straight away with
their distinctively vibrant colours.
But this isn’t it; the list of potential
applications goes on: rollable elec-
tronic newspaper that updates itself
daily with newspapers, animated art-
work (or even TV) on clothes, head-
mounted display system for soldiers,
light sources--, etc. For now, OLEDs
may still be occupying a small part of
the TV and monitor market, but as
new production processes emerge and
breakthroughs breakthrough they will
become more affordable – I don’t see
why this can’t happen within 5 years’
time. It will also be interesting to see if
OLEDs can exceed LCDs’ performance
by then – mind you, it did take about
30 years for LCDs to occupy more than
half the TV market!
OLED on your wrist!
