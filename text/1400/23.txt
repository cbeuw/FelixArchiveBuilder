Varsity Highlights The ACC’s view
My last varsity has just been and
gone. No longer will I be able to
compete alongside my fellow stu-
dents studying “proper” courses and
show the medics how to play sport
… still, I get the pleasure of sum-
ming up Varsity from an ACC point
of view. I am sure that the rest of this
pullout will be filled with relevant
banter and detail about how we man-
aged to dominate most of the sports
and how rugby gave it their best shot
but sadly came second once more. I
don’t have that much more to add, so
I shall be brief.
Whilst the rugby match is often
seen as the main showpiece, with
the crowds, the rector, the chants,
and the big shiny cup you must re-
member the vast number of sports
entering in the day’s competitions
with each being a battle worth win-
ning. This is a huge credit not only
to the vast range of facililties that we
have availible to us, but also to the
wide range and dedicated sporting
student population we have. To host
all these fixtures on a Wednesday af-
ternoon takes a tremendous amount
of organisation. Thanks must go
out to every captain who has man-
aged to field a team and those who
work alongside coaching staff to
produce teams we can be proud of.
Also to those unsung heros without
whom we would be lost at most fix-
tures who ensure that the pitches/
courts are suitable and ready, and to
those who coordinate the fixtures to
make sure a suitable programme and
transport can be found. So a great
big thank you to everyone involved.
That’s sounding rather a lot like
an Oscar acceptance speech, isn’t
it? Without wanting to lessen our
gratitude I will swiftly get back to the
true meaning of varsity, IC beating
the medics in most sports, and the
good-humoured rivalry that festers
between our great sporting sides.
This rivalry, whilst occasionally seen
as a negative thing, produces won-
derful one-off performances when
the club feels it matters; whether
it is Mr. Nedic striking a catalogue
pose in his undies whilst waiting
for replacement shorts on the side-
line, the cool and collected head of
the hockey captain scoring a win-
ning sudden death p-flick, or just a
thoroughly annoying gold-trousered
“phoenix” prancing around the um-
pires … nobody can deny the special
atmosphere a varsity day holds and
that most definately is something to
build on and celebrate.
This just leaves me just to point
out again how we beat the medics in
the majority of sports, and how all of
the IC sportsmen should join us in
celebrating this great achievement at
the ACC Dinner on the 18th March,
where we will be presenting our an-
nual sportsman and team of the year
awards as well as colours. Ask your
club captains for details.

Varsity Special
Varsity – that annual extravaganza
of sport, booze, and banter which
clearly shows us why the separation
of medic and non-medic clubs is one
of the strongest aspects of Imperial,
and so should never be touched! The
provision of medic and non-medic
clubs is a fantastic thing that is
shared by us all; be in no doubt that
we all would pay the price if it were
ever to be changed!
I don’t think there is anyone, even
those hiding in the dark corners of
theMechanicalEngineeringbuilding
who would not agree that this was
the best Varsity yet, one which I am
sure will set the standard for years to
come. The JPR Williams match was
probably the closest and most excit-
ing yet, with Imperial proving that
they fully deserved promotion to
the BUSA Premiership, and a young,
fresh-faced Imperial Medicals side
scrapping to a nail-biting 22-19 vic-
tory which puts them well on their
way to making it 10 years in a row.
I am delighted to see that the “love”
between medics and non-medics is
still flowing, and that in most sports
the competition was tight, providing
some excellent viewing. Through
grated teeth I must however con-
gratulate Imperial on winning the
overall Varsity day 13.5-8.5.
I want to congratulate all those
teams that took part, in particular
ICSM Netball led by Catherine At-
kin, and Imperial Medicals RFC led
by Ruiaridh Crawford, for the fan-
tastic achievement of winning a full
house in their respective sports. I am
fully confident that next year we will
see a rampant ICSM follow the lead
of Netball and Rugby to return and
win back the overall Varsity compe-
tition, proving that quality is much
better than quantity when it comes
to students!
Finally on behalf of ICSM I would
just like to thank all those involved
in what was another fantastic Var-
sity day. In particular I would like to
thank all those in Sport Imperial and
ICU for all the hard work they put in
to ensure its continued success.

Imperial College
vs
Imperial Medicals
OVERALL SCORE
14.5 8.5
Waking up last Wednesday morning, I
felt the nerves kicking in and I wasn’t
even competing!
No matter how much planning you’ve
done or how many contingency plans
you’ve made, running the Varsity event
is as nerve-racking as competing in it.
I know just how important the Varsity
is for many students at Imperial and I
feel nervous for all of them! I love look-
ing back on the day and picking out my
favourite bits.
Looking back as one of the organis-
ers, there wasn’t too much to worry
about in the end and there were defi-
nitely more highlights than low lights.
Here are my top five favourite bits of
the JPR Williams Rugby match:
1. A draw at full time for the first
time in Varsity history
What a game! I don’t think people
expected a draw – I know I certainly
didn’t. Both sides deserve a lot of credit
for providing us with an incredibly en-
tertaining match to watch. It was ex-
citing from the first minute and kept
us on the edge of our seats all the way
till the final whistle at full time and of
course into extra time.
The Imperial end of the stands went
crazy when their side were leading 6
points to 3 but then the Medics’ end
matched their counterparts’ vocal ef-
forts when the score was equal at half
time. The second half was even more
thrilling with more nail-biting tension
as Imperial were leading once again
with 19 points to 14 when lo and be-
hold, the Medics came back and scored
a try resulting in the full time draw of
19 all. Great stuff!
2. An Imperial player receiving the
Man of the Match award for the
first time
The results were in at the end of the
match (finally) and yes the Medics won
for the sixth time but for the first time,
JPR Williams awarded Man of the
Match honour to an Imperial player
– hooker and kicker Alex Johnstone.
Alex even got the opportunity to say a
few words – not a normal occurrence.
Well done Alex!
3. Felix Sports Editor Takes His
Kit Off!
Felix Sports Editor and Imperial
prop, Jovan Nedic, publicly removed
his shorts (after they split!) and, would
you believe, replaced them with a new
pair! He was as speedy as possible but
we all saw it! It almost made up for not
having any streakers this year.
4. Having over 1000 people there
With an array of people at the game
from players, students, College, and
Union staff, VIPs, guests, parents of
players, coaches, physios and medics,
match officials, Sport Imperial staff,
local residents, and anyone else who
decided to come along and watch, I felt
very proud to see that everyone seemed
to be enjoying themselves. Every single
person there contributed to the amaz-
ing atmosphere on the night and par-
ticular acknowledgment must go to the
very vocal supporters at both ends of
the stand. I am sure both teams appre-
ciated your efforts – we certainly did!
5. The Boy in the Golden Trousers
I don’t know his name but he was
there in his splendidly golden, shiny
trousers supporting the Medics. He
himself was very inoffensive and in-
deed rather sweet. His trousers on
the other hand … I did actually bump
into him the following day and as well
as looking rather bashful and embar-
rassed when he recognised me he also
looked like he’d had a bit of a rough
night. Thanks for the entertainment
our boy in the golden trousers.
There were lots more great moments
from the day and if I could mention
them all I would! Thank you to all the
players and spectators for making the
event such a pleasure for the Sport Im-
perial team to organise!
