Virgo
Moving swiftly on,
Ahmed Donald.
I saw you outside
the playground of
the Notting Hill
School for Wannabe
Scholars. But don’t worry, I like you. I won’t
tell anyone. Just get rid of your fucking ice-
cream van because your stealing my trade and
more importantly my little weekend bundles
of pleasure.
Scorpio
Next up, Roger
Wilfredo de
Chocola Winston IX
of Hervengaal.
...
The fuck? Do I
even need to slag you off? Clearly just by
reading your name, er, names I can tell your
a mong. Not even a good mong like the ones
that swin in rivers. Fuck off and lie under
Cape Canaveral when the next space shuttle
launches into space.
Libra
Jen, Just Jen. Who
comes up with a
crippled name like
that? What the
hell’s going to hap-
pen if you ever get
married? Your world will collapse. You’ll have
to fill in the surname box on any forms you
complete. You won’t be able to play for Brazil’s
international football team. My advice: get a
lead enema and end yourself. Now.
Sagittarius
Barry Smith. Let
me guess, you’re
more common than
pond scum and you
detest Polish people
because they work
harder and for less money than you? Yeah?
Thought so. Firstly, pull your fucking trou-
sers up or I’m going to ram a wind turbine up
there. Next, bend over. Now I’m going to kick
you into the Eiffel Tower. DIE.
Capricorn
A. Geek. Who
the fuck do you
think you are?
Taking the beauty
of the horoscopes
anonymity and
raping it like a young puppy caught between
the bumpers of two lorries crashed in an M25
pile-up. Get over yourself. You will never be
the sizzle copes. We invented you. Bow down
to the master.
Cancer
Needy McNeedy...
I still haven’t gotten
over your invasive
nature. Don’t ever
think I’ll forget
the moment your
stench, your excuse for literature and your
embarrassing photo invaded my personal
space. Your days are numbered. You’ve got
fewer left to go than there are pages in this
excuse for a newspaper.
Gemini
Freddy Bouma. I’m
watching you. No,
not that way, the
other way. That’s
it. Why is your lip
trembling? Is my
presence unnerving? Am I making a warm
stream trickle down your inner thigh? Are
there goosebumps on your goosebumps? Is
that a hand drifting through the strands of
your hair? DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE
Leo
Tony Tempura.
Anyone made a
joke about your
ridiculous surname?
No? Well I’m going
to right now... I take
particular offence at you, you see. I’m going
to fucking batter you. Cunt. There! How’d you
like them apples? Fucking what? Want some?
Come any closer and I’ll ram a queef burger
down your throat so hard you’ll be farting fish
for fortnights.
Taurus
So... Becky Wright.
You think your
pretty hot after last
Friday in the Union.
Heh? Well, I didn’t
enjoy it for one
second. The only reason I didn’t say anything
at the time was so that I could write this
horoscope ridiculing you. Cup the balls. Work
the shaft. It’s not that hard. Especially when
your getting down to business. Improve or die,
horribly.
Aries
Your turn Manfred
Wilkinson. What’s
with your vanity?
Take that mirror out
of your purse, sorry,
man-bag shatter
it into pieces on the nearest rock and gouge
your eyes out with. You’ll be simultaneously
reduced to a hideous, bleeding monstrosity
whilst not being able to indulge in your
obsessive vanity.
Pisces
Now you, Phil
Roberts. Get the
fuck off Facebook.
Your eyes are going
to turn blue from
looking at that
corporate juggernaut of a ‘social’ networking
site. If you don’t I’ll stalk you on it anyway, find
you, cut a hole open in your leg and fill it with
dynamite. Light it. Run. Cackle. Laugh. You
have been warned.
H to the o, r, o, sizzle copes – it’s the Horoscopes
Aquarius
Hey guys, I want
you to go finish this
term on a high. But
in the mean time
I will insult you –
don’t worry the high
will come eventually. Just not now. So let’s be-
gin with you Edward Short. You really need to
lose some fucking weight. Anything remotely
active causes you to sweat so much that your
clothes shrink and you smell like a children’s
swimming pool.

Dear Needy McNeedy
I’m addicted to celebrity gossip sites. I
check them more often than I go on Fa-
cebook or check my emails and they are
taking over my life. I can’t seem to sleep
at night and I just sit and refresh them
until they are updated. How can I get
over this ridiculous obsession?
IHeartPerez
Dear IHeartPerez
You are now one step along the slow
road that leads to a degree. Obses-
sion with the Internet is just part and
parcel of the whole education system.
You need to learn to channel this into
an obsession with wikipedia, or some-
thing with more useful knowledge on it
(unless you wish to become a “writer”
–inverted commas on purpose – for
Heat magazine). I think you should
start listing your extensive celebrity
knowledge as one of your skills on your
CV; you might begin to find yourself in
demand for pub quiz teams (especially
at Imperial, where knowledge of popu-
lar culture is lacking significantly).

Dear Needy McNeedy
My flatmate’s boyfriend lives in another
city, but quite often comes to stay for a
week or sometimes longer. I like him;
it’s just that when he’s here, they don’t
get out of bed the whole time! She tells
me all they do is have sex; she comes
downstairs and complains how tired
she is. But what she doesn’t realise is
that I can hear every little movement
from her room, and I think I’m prob-
ably getting even less sleep than her. She
said sometimes they do it so much that
it hurts her. I don’t think it’s healthy for
them to be like this. What can I do?
Sleepless
Dear Sleepless
Despite you clearly just being jealous
of her situation (as we all are; who
wouldn’t want a man who can keep go-
ing all day), there are a few steps you
can take to solve the situation. Firstly,
buy some egg boxes and insulate the
wall between your rooms, or invest in
a good pair of earplugs. Secondly, in-
vite them outside to play croquet (I’ve
heard it is a brilliant substitute for con-
stant fucking.) Thirdly, find a partner
and outdo them (for maximum noise,
and thus effect, you might consider
putting up a sex swing). If none of these
work and you’re still bored and sleep-
less, you might want to consider offer-
ing to join in. If they are embarrassed
and say no, they might at least think to
keep the noise down in future.

Dear Needy McNeedy
My girlfriend and I have been going out
for a while, but recently we got quite
drunk together and she admitted to
cheating on me with another woman.
She said she really enjoyed it and might
like to try it again. I know most men
would love the thought of some girl on
girl action but because she doesn’t want
me to be involved, I still see it as cheat-
ing and can’t trust her anymore. Should
I leave her?
Ismycocknotgoodenough?
Dear IsMyCockNotGoodEnough,
Another woman. As if there’s some
kind of deficit in this damn college!
Why are you writing in to me, you id-
iot? You should just talk to her about
it. Don’t dump her out of the blue, dis-
cuss it with her first. I must admit that
yours is a pretty unusual reaction for
a man. Most would be jumping for joy
and begging to join in whilst salivating
freely. I’d recommend a trip to the doc-
tor to check you have the right amount
of man hormones. Don’t be so bloody
emotional, although if your girlfriend is
into the lesbian thing, acting like such
a woman might work in your favour.
Needy xxx
Dear Needy McNeedy
I’m not sure if you’ll ever get to read this
letter, but I’m going to write it you any-
way. You see, life’s been getting me down
a bit recently. My Renault Clio chugged
its final gulp of carbon monoxide the
other day and well... well, I don’t think
I can go on any longer. I mean come
on, what do Renault make nowadays?
Probably some stupid hybrid car and
one that carries 18 toddlers and 6 dogs.
WHERE’S THE CHARM?
