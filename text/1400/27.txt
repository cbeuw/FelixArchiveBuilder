Lacrosse
The Imperial Lacrosse Club found it-
self once again segregating for Varsity
to create the Medics Team and the Im-
perial Team.
Needless to say, tensions were high
with the medics hoping to re-instate
some pride, having faced an embar-
rassing loss at Varsity 2007, whilst the
Imperial team had an impressive repu-
tation to maintain.
Like last year, Imperial struggled to
get a full team and so the Medics of-
fered one of their plethora of substi-
tutes. Imperial gallantly declined thus
leading to a scenario none too different
to last year. So players and friends from
the lacrosse club found an atmosphere
of rivalry spurred between them as the
Medics and Imperial team warmed up
on opposite ends of the pitch.
The match began and it rapidly be-
came apparent that once again, the
Medics were due to be thoroughly
destroyed, but certainly not without
a good fight. Some spectacular saves
were made by the Medics goalie and
captain, Chris Baldwin. Fantastic game
play by centre Izzie Brown who had to
take on the tall challenge of Jon Down-
ing and superb running by John Jones
and Joe Bacarese-Hamilton.
Unfortunately, defence and attack
was no match for the Imperial team
who crushed the Medics, outrunning
them with some superb stick work
from Tim Barber, Ian Hunt, and Flor-
ence Slater. Their attack managed to
perturb even the solid defence of the
Lacrosse Club – Elsa Butrous and Emi-
ly Murray. Consistent commitment
and enthusiasm led to great perform-
ance from James Kerr, Max Holland,
Imperial dominate medic lacrosse
and Kiran Booth. New Imperial goalie,
Kristian Roberts, showed no fear with
regular attacks from the Medics team.
A particular highlight of the match
was when Ian Hunt of Imperial dislo-
cated the shoulder of key Medic player
Akira Fukutomi, resulting in the first
major accident of Varsity requiring the
assistance of the emergency services
and an ambulance (he survived!).
Imperial finished the match with a
storming victory of 15-3. The Med-
ics dragged their feet to the Imperial
team to shake hand. No one could have
summed up the match and day better
than the Lacrosse Club Mixed Captain,
Christopher Baldwin who finished
with, “I’m just glad we’re all in the same
team for the club!”.
And so together we all traipsed over
to the Harlington Bar and proceeded to
get suitably drunk with ample amounts
of Port and Gin consumed by all with
great team spirit!
This sea-
son, the la-
crosse club
has grown
beyond my
wildest ex-
pectations.
We set out to
put lacrosse
on the map and I believe that
we have achieved just that.
We differ in many respects to
most sports – boys and girls
train, play, and socialise to-
gether – in fact do everything,
including getting naked for a
certain page 3 … Our small
but wonderfully hardcore
group of enthusiastic, com-
mitted members along with
the help of a fantastic com-
mittee have transformed our
image. With three teams on
the go, it’s hard to keep track
but our ladies team came an
admirable 2nd in the League,
our mixed team are in the fi-
nal of the Challenge Cup and
our fledgling men’s team is
set to enter their own league
next season. We’ve even
organised our very own Im-
perial Cup: Mixed Lacrosse
Tournament with teams from
all over the country com-
ing to compete. This season
certainly has been successful
and next year, things can only
get better.

Imperial annihilate medicals in Ethos
The Varsity match at Ethos was at-
tended by many supporters from both
sides. The game kicked off at 8:20pm,
and the IC team gained the beginning
of a constant lead after Sofía’s 1st bas-
ket. However, during the first 5 minutes
of the first quarter there was not much
scoring, both teams still warming up.
Nonetheless, IC’s team got more into
the game and extended its advantage,
which was of more than 20 points by
the end of the quarter; the match had
already been decided. Throughout the
remaining quarters the IC team got
used to the rivals game and was able
to play accordingly, their confidence
building throughout.
During the 2nd and 3rd quarter the
team was still not playing at its best
and struggling to get used to zone de-
fence and the game tactics of the oppo-
nent. Nevertheless, there was brilliant
team effort and dedication as well as
willingness to play a good game which
led to an excellent performance, espe-
cially during the fourth quarter, which
can be appreciated by looking at the
final result.
Furthermore, during the fourth
quarter a pressure defence was played
very successfully, allowing for easy ball
recoveries at the opponent’s half court
which resulted in comfortable basket
scoring. Moreover, as the match devel-
oped the defence improved greatly and
the ball was recovered easily and very
frequently, providing scope for fast
breaks to take place.
Sofía Civeira and Dehydys Pimentel
were the top scorers with more than
20 points each. However, the overall
win would not have taken place had it
not been for every member’s contribu-
tion to the extraordinary final score. A
strong defence was played throughout
the game, and became the key point
for such great an advantage at the end.
Finally, I would like to thank all the
supporters for coming along and con-
gratulate all the team players that took
part in the game for their enthusiasm
and performance.

The season
has been
amazing for
the Women’s
1st. The team
has won all
of its ULU
matches;
hence winning the league
which entitles the team to a
promotion into the Premiere
division. This together with
a good turn up, an improve-
ment in the technique thanks
to the new coaching team,
and a raised team spirit, has
made this season one of the
best in recent years.
These outstanding results
are helping to raise the profile
of a previously ignored sport.
I would like to take the
chance to congratulate all
the players for this successful
year and encourage anyone
who has an interest in basket-
ball to come along for a tryout
at any of our training sessions
or join the team next season.
