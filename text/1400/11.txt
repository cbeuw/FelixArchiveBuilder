Politics
Raphael Lemkin spent much of
his life trying to get ‘Genocide’,
a term he coined from the greek
‘genos’ (family, tribe, or race)
and the latin ‘cide’ (killing), rec-
ognised. His first attempt to gain
recognition for the subject was
in 1933 when he presented an
essay on the ‘Crime of Barbar-
ity’ to the League of Nations. It
was not however until 1948 that
his ‘Crime of Barbarity’ was for-
mally recognised in internation-
al law. He died of a heart attack
in 1959, in New York. Sadly, and
perhaps unfairly, his funeral was
only attended by seven people.
Raphael Lemkin
feel, at the event was contained within
the three questions regarding interven-
tion. The different speakers interpret-
ed the right of intervention, and who
has it, differently. The question is by no
means trivial and concerns the tension
between the sovereignty of independ-
ent nations and humanity’s obligation
to protect humans from abuse, vio-
lence, and genocide. In 1999 and 2000,
former Secretary-General Kofi Annan
encapsulated the problem by asking:
“… if humanitarian intervention is,
indeed, an unacceptable assault on
sovereignty, how should we respond to
a Rwanda, to a Srebrenica – to gross
and systematic violations of human
rights that affect every precept of our
common humanity?”
Dr.Smithplacedtherightofinterven-
tion in the hands of the U.N. Security
Council, stating that any international
intervention must be authorized by
the U.N. The other speakers disagreed
with Dr. Smith’s assertion. Mr. Gorski
argued that any group of nations has
the right to intervene if the motivation
is to protect citizens; however, he con-
ceded that it was ambiguous and was
unable to address how large a group of
nations must be before they have the
right to intervene. Dr. Eltringham con-
tradicted Dr. Smith’s statements most
strongly. The U.N. in fact does not
have the right, under the U.N. charter,
to intervene in cases of genocide. The
U.N. is mandated to maintain interna-
tional peace and security, he reminded
us. Therefore, internal issues (one of
which may be genocide) are not within
the authority of the U.N. or the Secu-
rity Council. Instead, Dr. Eltringham
argued, we must intervene through
the monitoring of human rights, spe-
cifically via the voluntary International
Covention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Racial Discrimination. Sig-
natories to the convention have agreed
to monitoring, therefore the Conven-
tion’s Committee have the authority to
intervene. “Respect human rights and
you avoid genocide”, he declared. How-
ever, Dr. Eltringham failed to explain
who has the right to intervene in the
case of non-signatories or when direct
military action is required.
Although all signatories to the U.N.
Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide
have a duty to prevent genocide, the
prevailing political wind is more likely
to determine who has the ‘right’ to in-
tervene. Mr. Koundarjian’s argument
Greg Stanton’s 8-Stages of Genocide
In 1996, Gregory H. Stanton,
President of Genocide Watch,
described the eight stages of
genocide and preventative meas-
ures that should be taken at each
stage.
1. Classification
– All cultures have categories to
divide people into ‘us’ and ‘them’.
Bipolar societies that lack mixed
groups are most likely to experi-
ence genocide, e.g. Rwanda.
Prevention
– Insititutions that transcend eth-
nic and racial divisions are the
most effective defense at this
stage. The Church is an example
of an insitution that could play
this role.
2. Symbolization
– Derogatory words and sym-
bols are given to the classifica-
tions, for example ‘Gypsies’.
Prevention
– Hate speech and symbols can
be legally banned. Without wide-
spread cultural support, how-
ever, the banning of hate speech
can be ineffective. However, with
support the denial of symboliza-
tion can be extremely effective.
3. Dehumanization
– The humanity of a group is
denied in order to overcome the
normal human revulsion against
murder. Hate propaganda be-
gins to appear in popular media.
Comparisions with vermin and
insects are made.
Prevention
– Leaders should condemn the
use of hate speech. Hate propa-
ganda should be banned from
media and hate crimes should be
promptly punished.
4. Organization
– Genocide is always organized
using militias to provide denial of
state responsiblity. Organization
can be informal or decentralized.
Prevention
– On the international stage, mem-
bership of these militias should be
illegal. Arms embargoes should
be applied against the nation and
travel bans should be put on their
leaders.
5. Polarization
– The groups are driven apart.
Laws may forbid marriage or so-
cial interaction. Extremists target
moderates and silence the political
centre.
Prevention
– Security and assistance should
be provided to moderates and hu-
man rights groups. The assets of
extremists should be seized and
extremist governments should face
sanctions.
6. Preparation
– Victims are identified and physi-
cally seperated out from the rest of
society. They are confined to fam-
ine-struck regions, sent to camps,
or forced into ghettos.
Prevention
– A Genocide Emergency must be
declared and international armed
intervention should be prepared.
Heavy assistance should be pro-
vided to the victim group and at
the very least humanitarian aid
should be prepared for the inevi-
table tide of refugees.
7. Extermination
– The mass killing, legally called
genocide, is an extermination to
the killers because their victims
are not believed to be fully hu-
man. Sometimes the genocide
results in revenge killings, creat-
ing a downward sprial of geno-
cide on both sides.
Prevention
– Only rapid armed intervention
can stop genocide at this point.
Real safe areas and refugee es-
cape corridors should be estab-
lished with heavily armed inter-
national protection. If the U.N.
is paralyzed, regional alliances
must act. The international re-
sponsiblity to protect transcends
the individual nation’s narrow
interests.
8. Denial
– This is the surest indicator of
further genocidal massacres. The
perpetuators hide the evidence
in whatever way possible. They
block investigations and contin-
ue to govern with force until they
are driven from power.
Prevention
– Certainly, by this stage, all that
can be done is to prosecute the
perpetrators. The International
Criminal Court is appropriate for
this function. The political will to
arrest and prosecute must exist.

“Respect human
rights and you
avoid genocide”
seemed the most pragmatic of all the
speakers. He emphasized the need for
internationalinstitutions,notnecessar-
ily the U.N., to take the lead rather than
individual states. NATO’s intervention
in Kosovo was ideal, considering the
political disagreement at the time be-
tween veto-holding Security Council
members such as Russia and the U.S.;
if we followed Dr. Smith’s emphasis on
the U.N., or Dr. Eltringham’s focus on
human rights, it is unlikely that effec-
tive action would have occurred.
The question of timing of interven-
tion produced a varied response. Mr.
Koundarjian looked to political neces-
sitation to inform his answer. Without
substantial political clout and media
support, any intervention will be ham-
pered in its efforts. In order to garner
both political and media support, any
military intervention must be timed to
balance the need to prevent death and
the need to portray an intervention
as urgent. He pointed to the military
intervention in Kosovo as a model of
good timing. On the other hand, po-
litical intervention must occur as early
as possible. A political solution is dif-
ficult to achieve once the violence has
started, he stated. The longer the vio-
lence has been ongoing, the more dif-
ficult a political solution becomes, as
we have seen in Palestine. Again there
was significant disagreement between
Mr. Koundarjian and Dr. Eltringham.
Dr. Eltringham rejected the idea of in-
tervention as something that happens
when the threat of violence arises.
Intervention, through the
moni- toring of
human rights, should be constant and
long-term. Although the continuous
monitoring of human rights does not
fit in well with a culture of bold media
headlines and short political sound-
bites, it is a system that prevents es-
calation and genocide. Ultimately, he
admitted, the success stories are rarely
publicized. The system is long-term
and ‘boring’, it’s not interesting to the
media and politicians who “only want
to react to horror stories”.
The steps that we as a society take
to prevent genocide must reflect the
complexity and multi-faceted nature
of the issue. Each speaker admitted
that regardless of how we organise a
military intervention, it must always
be the last resort. A military interven-
tion is a sign of failure rather than suc-
cess; it shows us that we have failed to
prevent human rights abuses and that
we have failed to tackle discrimination
and prejudice between peoples. The
military is only needed when violence
is imminent or already begun and by
this stage we have to ask ourselves,
as an international community, why
didn’t we act sooner? Dr. Smith said
that: “Victims of genocide fall outside
the Universe of moral obligation”. They
have been separated from the rest of
society, attacked within popular cul-
ture, and dehumanised. In order to
prevent further cases of genocide we
need to have the courage to stand up
and identify prejudice and condemn it.
In the UK, the treatment of travellers
fulfill the first three stages of genocide.
They are already socially excluded
(admittedly by choice) and one has to
look no further than the Daily Mail for
hate propaganda. The origins of geno-
cide are so small, that it is difficult to
believe that they need to be addressed.
However, the well-documented path
to the Holocaust shows us that
from small origins, human-
ity can move quickly to
committing terrible
violence.
