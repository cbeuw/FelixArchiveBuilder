T
his year’s JPR Williams
Cup was billed as ‘The Big
One’ with the Imperial 1st
XV rugby team gaining
promotion into the BUSA
Southern Premiership B and the Medi-
cals pulling off a ‘Great Escape’ to stay
in the same league. Imperial have been
on superb form, comfortably beat-
ing their last two opponents, scoring
over 49 points in each game, whilst the
Medicals have had to fight hard to earn
their wins.
The crowd began to gather at Rich-
mond Rugby Ground from about 6.30
p.m., easily filling the main stand, as
well as the side of the pitch which re-
sulted in a crowd of nearly 1,100! They
were expecting a hard fought battle,
they were expecting blood and tears
on the pitch, they were expecting the
game to go down to the wire. They
were not going to be disappointed.
After the formalities were completed
the game kicked off under the bright
lights on a clear, still night in south
west London. As ever, the opening
minutes proved to be a frantic affair as
both sides came out fired up; however,
neither team was able to gain the up-
per hand. With this fast pace and huge
rivalry between the two sides, disci-
pline was a bit poor to begin with, with
both sides conceding penalties. The
Medicals were afforded the first op-
portunity to open the scoring but fly-
half Dan Neville’s penalty went wide of
the left upright. The IC kicker Alexan-
der Johnstone, who unusually was also
their hooker, was also to miss his first
effort at goal as the game remained
scoreless early on.

With the game finding its rhythm,
both sides tried to exploit each other’s
weaknesses. The Medicals set up a
catch and drive from the lineout, five
metres from the Imperial try line, yet
Imperial were more than ready for
them and pushed them back a good few
metres before the ball was distributed
to the backs who were unable to score.
Imperial, on the other hand, attempted
to exploit the Medicals’ weaker back
line, running great attacking lines, but
the Medicals predicted this and their
defence was superb. With neither side
being able to penetrate the line effec-
tively, only errors kept the score board
ticking with a further two penalties,
leaving the score at half-time 6 – 6.
The Medicals, who have always con-
sidered themselves to be the superior
team, seemed shaken by their first half
performance. Imperial were full of
hope after seeing how much their per-
formance had affected the opposition
and they knew that the start of the sec-
ond half was going to be tough. This
was indeed the case as the Medicals
came out with all guns blazing, thirsty
for a try, eager to take the lead and re-
iterate the fact that they considered
themselves to be the better team.
Both Medical centres James Shar-
ples and Ben Davies carried well and
ran hard lines at the Imperial defence
which gave wingers Harry Thomp-
son and Kevin Ilo space out wide. The
Medicals’ pressure was to tell as a quick
ball on the right wing was passed along
the line to Huw Williams who entered
the line from full-back. Ignoring the
unmarked Harry Thompson outside
him Williams went for the line and was
able to dive over and touch down de-
spite the close attention of the Imperial
cover tacklers. Neville was unable to
add the conversion from near the left
touchline which left the score at 11 – 6
to the Medicals, but about five minutes
later they were awarded with a penalty
to stretch the lead to 14 – 6.
Imperial, having sat through the
storm, came out the other side ready
to really show what they are capable of.
In broken and open play the Imperial
backs are deadly, whilst the Medicals
were strong in the tight; the aim was
simple, keep the ball away from their
forwards and break up their backs. Im-
perial scrum half, Freddie Chalk and
fly-half Jo Brown were on great form,
both marshalling the backs and for-
wards as a unit which eventually led
to a penalty, which was converted. Im-
perial kept on pushing, gaps were be-
ing created at every opportunity that
stretched and tested the Medicals’ de-
fence; however, it could not withstand
the push by Imperial and eventualy
Imperial’s first try was scored by centre
Tom Carroll to level the game again.
Imperial were not going to let this run
of good form slip and the pressure was
maintained on the Medicals’ backs;
however, the line-outs were proving to
be a bit of a problem with the Medicals’
second row Rob Anderson consistently
being a nuisance to the Imperial line-
out.
The Medicals did have chances of
their own and tried to break down the
wing with Kevin Ilo, only to be stopped
in spectacular style by Imperial’s cap-
tain Andrew Jasudasen and vice-cap-
tain Flannan O’Mahney. With three
minutes to go on the clock, Imperial
spotted a gap in the Medicals’ defence
and fly-half Jo Brown chipped the ball
over for Alex Johnstone to catch and
score. Imperial were in the lead 19
– 14.
With minutes to go, all Imperial had
to do was defend their line as they
knew that the Medicals were going to
come at them, and they did, however
after ten minutes the game was still go-
ing and the Medicals exploited a gap
on the blind side with Rob Anderson,
scoring the life-saving try. The full-
time whistle blew and the score was
19 – 19 and for the first time ever, the
game went into extra time. Both sides
had 20 minutes to make their mark, but
with discipline still being a problem be-
tween the two sides, and the fact that
the players were getting tired, penalties
were being awarded all over the pitch.
It were the Medicals who were able to
get one within kicking distance and
took the lead at 22 – 19, but no matter
how much the Imperial boys kept try-
ing to get to their line, they couldn’t get
Medicals scrape to victory
a penalty within kicking distance and
as the full time whistle blew the Medi-
cals were relieved whilst the Imperial
side were left wondering how they let
it slip at the last moment.
JPR Williams himself commented af-
ter the game that the Medicals should
consider themselves very very lucky to
have won the game, which means a lot
since the former Wales and British Li-
ons full-back is a Medicals Old Boy. He
commended the Imperial players and
especially Man of the Match Alexan-
der Johnstone of whom he said: “This
boy can score tries, kick conversions
and penalties, and make big hits, all
whilst being a hooker as well!”
With both sides now in the Premier-
ship, next year’s encounter promises to
be a spectacle not to be missed. The
Medicals received one hell of a wake-
up call from Imperial; these games are
no longer a walk in the park for them,
and both sides have to put in every-
thing they have to come out the vic-
tors. I’m looking forward to it already!
