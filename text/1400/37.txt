Fashion
A
s the after-party start-
ed, the Felix team or-
dered up a multitude
of Brazilian-inspired
mojitos, and contin-
ued in our quest to
hunt down anyone of any importance
involved in the show.
After about 3 hours of sweettalking
bouncers, getting unauthorised back-
stage access, then getting chucked out,
we finally caught up with Alice John-
ston, co-chair of the Imperial College
RAG Fashion show, for a few quick
words.
As we found somewhere quiet (I say
quiet, we were basically outside the
venue) she seemed tired and relieved
but extremely happy with what she and
fellow co-chair Josh Wong achieved,
Felix: Its all over now, how are
you feeling?
Alice: My feet are starting to kill me,
but it’s been amazing. We’ve raised
around £6000 depending on the do-
nations made tonight, and that’s the
most important thing. I thought it was
amazing, and I loved every single sec-
ond of it. Everyone worked so hard and
it all finally came together,, so I’m com-
pletely over the moon.
Felix: What was the inspira-
tion behind this year’s GLOBAL
DISCO theme?
Alice: Josh and I wanted something to
tie everything together and we had lots
of different ideas for walks, and having
been to Glastonbury together, music
was very important to us. SO we want-
ed to tie the music in as well. There was
the whole ethical thing as well, which
brings in the global aspect of it all, and
the disco brings the music side.
Felix: Ethical fashion has been
highlighted in exhibitions in
recent times, did you feel it was
important to showcase the ethi-
cal walk this year?
Alice: Yeh definitely. Its something
that’s been big in the media at the mo-
ment and we thought this would be a
good opportunity to show people that
ethical didn’t mean boring. . The stuff
looked really beautiful, and places like
Adilli that lent us the clothes do beauti-
ful clothes that are ethically produced.
I think it was really good place to send
that message home.
Felix: Do you think ethical fashion
is the future of fashion?
Alice: I’d like to think so, yeh. I mean
more and more places and becoming
like that, lots of places have their own
ethical lines and I hope to see that in-
creasing. So yeh, hopefully it is the fu-
ture of fashion.
Felix: Are there any other mes-
sages you want people to take
from the show tonight?
Alice: A good combination of everyone
having a really awesome night, but we
wanted to show them what a fashion
show can be like; it can be fun and not
just everyone poncing around.
Our congratulations go to Alice
and Josh for such a well-organ-
ised and successful evening, They
now go back to finishing their
medical degrees from Imperial.
Good luck.
Fashion can be fun; it’s not just poncing around
