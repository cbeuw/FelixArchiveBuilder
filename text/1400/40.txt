Music
Music Editors – Peter Sinclair and Susan Yu
Trainspotting on The Metros
Susan Yu
Music Editor
O
h my God! It’s nearly
the demise of this term.
About time too. Don’t
know about you, but I
certainly need a break.
A long long break to get my bearings
right again. Have been running on
empty of late, my batteries seriously
need recharging. Rewind in time to
roughly a fortnight ago, I braved the
chilly still-Winterish weather and
tubed it to Camden to see the boys
from Pecknam, namely The Metros.
How I detest the tube. Crushed, el-
bowed and confined in a hot smelly
train with a bunch of strangers at rush
hour is far from the sublime bliss that
a chilled-out evening lounging on the
sofa could offer. The sacrifices I make
for this crazy, majorly hard slog of a
job. Being only a considerably mild vic-
tim of travel sickness (thank God), one
tends to leg it out, as fast as one could,
from the imprisonment that stuffy ve-
hicles of any shape or size brings.
Having never done a face-to-face in-
terview before, I was delighted when
it turned out to be very laidback and
straightforward. My previous precon-
ceptions of arrongant so and sos who
have landed themselves the honeypot
were met with two sound guys who
truly enjoyed what they are doing,
making music and playing to their
hearts’ content. Saul the frontman/lead
singer did not lack any charisma, with
a playful twinkle in his eyes the whole
time, whilst Joe the bassist was earthy,
generally good-humored and friendly.
We chatted about a weird bunch of
random things and, of course, music.
What else? You will find a few inter-
esting snippets about these cheeky
boys too.
I went to see the brilliant Editors at
Alexandra Palace. last week. When
Tom Smith, the vocalist sauntered on
stage, phwoar, what a vision, I mused.
Didn’t know he was a looker as well
as being a superb crowd-pleaser. The
band effortlessly rode on a wave of in-
credible energy, culminating in a sen-
sational showcase of quality tunes and
immense soundscapes. It’s times like
these that I love being a music editor.
30th March. My birthday. Won’t be
sweet 18 anymore. Damn. Last year of
my teens. Bloody scary, if you ask me.
Time to leave adolescence and join the
world of adulthood. March time also
means that Easter is looming. Choco-
late binge sessions. We had early East-
er egg tasting sessions in Felix offices
this week. Mmm. Thorntons and Lin-
dor, music to my ears. Good chocolate
can be heavenly, but one might just feel
slightly queasy after an overdose. Nev-
er got to that stage yet. I can manage
to live a relatively colourful life without
chocolate even though it does mean
that I’d have to pig out on biscuits in-
stead. But, decent music at the end of
the day can beat chocolate anytime.

The Metros are essentially 5 lads from
Pecknam, South London, who have
jumped on the bandwagon that is
Rock ‘n’ Roll. The band consists of Saul
(lead singer), Joe (bassist), Jak (guitar-
ist), Charlie (guitarist) and last but not
least, Freddie (drummer). Currently
they are zooming across the country
on a headline tour, with their debut
single release ‘Education Pt. 2’ on the
near horizon. Hailed as “Rock’n’roll
street poetics that’ll have you tossing
yourself 10ft high.” by NME and set to
“…profer another prosperous year for
1965 Records” by Dazed & Confused,
these guys are looking to have a train-
mendous 2008.
Saul and Joe from the band kindly
agreed to be interviewed before the
gig at the Camden Barfly. See across
the page for the review itself.
Who thought of the name ‘The
Metros’?
Saul: Me and the guitar player Jak, we
went through a lot of shit names, like
‘Orange Juice’, ‘Eastern Block’…but
anyway, we decided that we couldn’t
think of anything and we had to come
up with a name so we went for ‘The
Metros’. Incidentally, there’s another
band called The Metros. Somebody
made the mistake at T in the Park, say-
ing that we sound like a cross between
early Beatles and Stereophonics. He
meant The Metros from Swansea.
That’s not us.
How did you guys get together?
Joe: Me, the bassist and the drummer
all went to school together.
Saul: Me and Jak have known each oth-
er most of our lives. Our parents are
publishers. We all kind of know each
other through Freddie, the drummer.
He’s kind of brought us together.
How long have you been playing
together?
Saul: Almost three years all together.
How old are you?
Joe: Us two are 19 and the others are
18.
Describe yourselves in five words.
Saul: Five boys with guitars/
microphones.
Who writes the songs?
Saul: Me and Jak write the songs. That’s
why we are rich and you are poor.
Where do you get your
inspirations?
Saul: Anywhere really. Mostly from
getting signed and earning money
and being frustrated. Also, from living
in South London. Old records - Stiff
Records inspire me.
Joe: Basically from playing gigs so we
that could get into venues and getting
a few drinks because we were that skint
back then.
How are you guys finding touring
at the moment?
Saul: It’s great man.
Joe: We have a great laugh.
Do you guys fight?
Saul and Joe in unison: Yes.
Proper fights?
Saul: Not fist fights.
Joe: I almost got into a physical fight
with the bassist at the Skins Festival. I
kicked over his drink by accident and
he threw a drink in my face and it sort
of escalated from there. I slapped him
in the face and he slapped me even
harder. Then he pushed me against a
wall and the drummer was trying to
break us up. And me and Charlie the
bassist, we were like “Fuck this man,
fucking prick”. So yeah. But apart from
that, we are all quite friendly.
Do you think music improves
with age?
Saul: Yes. A lot of bands, with their first
album, it’s always kind of raw isn’t it?
As you get older, you become wiser
and you start to write better music.
Proper music. Hopefully.
How did you get to collaborate
with Toddla T?
Saul: He’s great, a really nice bloke and
should be supporting us tonight. He’s
from the same record label as us. He’s
produced music for people like Jamie T
and stuff like that. It’s all good. We are
going to do some more collaboration
with him in the future.
If you were to play with any band
alive or dead who would it be?
Saul: Err…What’s that geezer’s name?
The one who sang ‘I’ve put a spell on
you’…Screaming Jay Hawkins. Ian
Dury and The Blockheads too. They
are like an obvious band. I’d quite like
to play with The Sex Pistols and The
Clash back in the 1970s. That would
be pretty cool man.
What’s the best gig you’ve ever
played?
Saul:That’sreallydifficult.We’veplayed
so many gigs. Best venue we’ve played
at is probably at the Roundhouse.
That’s the biggest gig we’ve played at.
That’s was fucking awesome.
Joe: We really enjoyed the little venues
as well.
Saul: But when we go on tour, we play
in shitholes where no one has heard of,
places like Hull. Horrible places. Some
people say London is a horrible place
to play gigs. The crowd can be rather
nasty.
Joe: People come on stage and steal
stuff. They try to pull leads from our
guitars while we are playing and taking
them as souvenirs.
Who do you think that your music
is aimed at?
Saul: Well, I would like to have thought
that our music is aimed at cool people.
What is the best thing about be-
ing in the music business?
Saul: You get lots of free food and
drinks. Free stuff. And you don’t have
to get a job.
Joe: You can enjoy what you are doing
for free and you get paid for it.
Do you get paid a lot?
Saul: Yeah. We are alright. We’ve signed
a publishing deal for quite a lot of mon-
ey but we are not sorted for life.
Joe: We don’t get paid for doing indi-
vidual gigs anymore.
Football or rugby?
Saul: Neither.
Joe: I’d go for rugby if I have to. Table
tennis man, that’s what I’d go for.
Who gets the most attention from
the girls?
Saul: Probably me I suppose.
Joe: That’s probably true. Saul’s the
lead singer so he gets the most atten-
tion. Girls like him.
Do you have girlfriends?
Saul: We all have girlfriends.
Pubs or nightclubs?
Saul: Pubs.
Joe: It depends on what kind of mood
I’m in.
What’s the best cure for a
hangover?
Saul: More booze…Iron Bru man…
Apparently, a pint of beer with a shot of
expresso in the beer. That does sound
