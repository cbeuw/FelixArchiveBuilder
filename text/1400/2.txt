Government ID cards for
2008/09 overseas freshers
2009: Home students encouraged to hold national ID cards too
The Home Office has announced that
in November of this year, identity
cards will begin to be introduced for
non-European Economic Area foreign
nationals (which include Swiss nation-
als). Importantly, the foreign nationals
to be targeted first are those categories
believed to be most likely to commit
immigration offenses, which include
students. Due to the large proportion
of Imperial students that are not from
Europe, some of next years freshers
will have to carry a government ID
card with a college ID card.
A National Identity Register will be
created, at an estimated cost believed
to be £5.5 billion. The government
have stated that contrary to fears, the
new cards will only £30 per person.
The government has planned that by
2012, 90 per cent of foreign nationals
in the UK will have an ID card.Finger-
prints and a digital facial image will be
held on the National Identity Register
and the ID card. The card will also
show whether or not the holder is enti-
tled to work, benefits and the length of
time they may stay in the UK. A valid
passport will still be recognised as ID
for foreign nationals.
From 2009 the scheme will begin
to affect Home students also. At first
students will be encouraged to volun-
tarily sign up to the scheme but from
2011/2012 all UK passport applicants
will be signed up to the National Iden-
tity Register. British citizens will have
the choice to have a passport, ID card
or both.
The private sector will not be able to
access your information without your
consent, however police, security, in-
telligence agencies and HM Revenue
and Customs may access your details
without your consent, including where
and when you used your card.

“The National Identity Register [...]
will be a severe threat to our security
and a real target for criminals, hack-
ers and terrorists,” said David Davis,
shadow Home Secretary
The government argues that the Na-
tional Identity Register, along with ID
cards will help increase identity secu-
rity, reduce illegal immigration and
tackle fraud issues. Home Secretary
Jaqui Smith said “The Government’s
National Identity Scheme means that
for the first time UK residents will have
a single way to secure and verify their
identity. We will be able to better pro-
tect ourselves and our families against
identity fraud, as well as protecting our
communities against crime, illegal im-
migration and terrorism.”

No-confidence motion called
against CGCU President
A motion proposed by members of the
City and Guilds College Union on the
19th of February calls for a vote of non-
confidence in CGCU President Tristan
Sherliker. The fifteen supporters of
the paper (including two CGCU vice-
presidents, the Honorary Secretary,
and two Departmental Representa-
tives) believe that Tristan Sherliker has
not lived up to his responsibilities as
President.
The motion cites a wide range of du-
ties left unattended, including his fail-
ure to submit the CGCU Autumn term
report to the Union Council by their
required deadline, despite having had
ten weeks’ notice.
Amongst other criticisms, the pro-
posed motion accuses Sherliker of ‘spo-
radic’ attendance at CGCU Executive
Council meetings and of being difficult
to contact via phone or e-mail. The
motion also quotes the CGCU consti-
tution’s calls for “general meetings [to
be convened] in each of the Autumn,
Spring and Summer terms” and states
that “The Management Committee
shall meet once every two weeks in
term-time”. This is contrasted with the
claim that Sherliker has called no gen-
eral meetings this academic year, and
that only two Management Commit-
tee meetings have taken place over the
same period.
An emergency meeting of the Execu-
tive Council has been scheduled for
Wednesday the 19th of March to de-
cide on the no-confidence motion.

Grant-Thornton Vice-Chancellors’ pay
survey for 2006-7 has been released,
revealing the annual salaries of more
than 150 UK university vice-chancel-
lors (V-Cs), or equivalent positions.
Imperial Rector Sir Richard Sykes tops
the list with a salary of £348,000 over
2006-7, a 6.7% increase from the year
before. Sir Richard is one of only two
V-Cs to have an annual salary of over
£300,000, with Professor Laura Tyson
of the London Business School being
the second.
An IC spokesperson made it very
clear that “salaries for all of Impe-
rial’s senior staff, including the Rec-
tor [take] into account the demands of
the job and the successes achieved.” Of
all the V-Cs mentioned in the Grant-
Thornton survey, Sir Richard is the
only one in the top five to receive no
money from his university towards his
pension fund, and thus “the value of
his remuneration is less than stated in
real terms.” Even with his pension con-
tribution simply added to his annual
salary, however, Nottingham V-C Sir
Colin Campbell only gets £6,000 more
per year than Sir Richard Sykes.
According to the THE academic pay
survey for the last academic year, re-
leased simultaneously, the average sal-
ary for IC staff is just under £44,000,
with the aforementioned London
Business school paying an average of
£132,769 over the same time period.
Full academic pay tables should al-
ready be available online from the THE
website.
