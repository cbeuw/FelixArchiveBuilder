Editor’s little blog!
First of all, a quick thank you to
everyone that voted for me for
Felix Editor next year, I will not
disappoint you!
So, as promised, here’s the Varsity
pull-out, containing all (or at least
everything I was given) the reports
on the days’ events. In here you’ll
find a comprehensive report with
pictures and player profiles for the
JPR Williams Cup. I wish I could
do one for every team, but as you
can see, this thing is already 16
pages long!
Thanks must go to everyone at
Sport Imperial for making this as
easy as possible, especially Nick
Gore and Leena Bharadia for their
help with securing an interview
with JPR Williams himself.
I must also thank all the people
who actually wrote the match
reports; if it weren’t for them, we
would have just had a pull-out
with pictures which, thinking about
it, would have been a lot easier.
Thanks also to the photographers
who got the pics!
Consider this a little memento of
the day and there will be one next
year. Hopefully with all the teams
contributing to the pull-out.
Enjoy!

ohn Peter Rhys Williams, known
universally as JPR Williams, the
man after whom the Varsity
match is after, played rugby union
for Wales between 1969 and 1981.
He was also, apparently, a competent
tennis player, but gave it up for the
then-amateur game of rugby union in
order to pursue a career in medicine.
He quickly attracted attention and was
consequently first capped by Wales in
1969, aged 19. He went on to earn 55
caps for Wales and 8 for the British
Lions.
He had many high points in his ca-
reer, being a key player in a Welsh side
that won Grand Slams in 1971, 1976,
and 1978, but is particularly remem-
bered for his record against England; in
10 tests between Wales and England he
scored five tries and was never on the
losing side. He was also outstanding
for the Lions, winning the 1971 series
against New Zealand with a long-range
drop-goal and playing a major role in
the 1974 ‘invincible’ series against
South Africa.
Whilst pursuing his medical career,
JPR Williams studied at St. Mary’s,
now one of the hospitals in the Imperi-
al College Medical School. It is because
of his great achievements, both at col-
lege and international rugby, that the
Varsity Match is named after him.
Felix Sport asked the man himself
a few questions on his thoughts on
the match, the day itself and sport in
general.
1) How does it feel to have the
main rugby event named after
you?
I am honoured to have the varsity
match named after me. It reminds me
of my medical school days. It’s hard to
believe that it is 40 years since I first
played for St. Mary’s. I still have a
photo in my “bar” of Professor Poulter,
me and the rest of the winning Sevens
team … with hair and sideboards each!
2) In your opinion, how has the
whole Varsity event developed?
There is a good healthy rivalry between
the medics and the college students
and it surely must be only a question
of time before the college gains its first
win!
3) What changes can you see hap-
pening in the future?
I hope the fixture continues to grow
and that the students show their sup-
port in time-honoured fashion.
4) How does it feel to have your
name sung with praise every time
you come to the event?
Very nice to be remembered after
spending all of twelve years at Mary’s.
Didn’t actually take me all that time to
qualify: I was also houseman for six
months, anatomy demonstrator for a
year, and a senior registrar for 3 years!
5) How has the spirit of sport
changed from your time at
Imperial?
The highest compliment is that the
spirit hasn’t changed, but that the lan-
guage has deteriorated (especially from
the girls!).
6) Is there enough emphasis on
sports in college, and schools in
general?
Probably not enough emphasis on
team sports theses days. My old school
still does well; my nephew Huw went
straight from Brynteg into the Medics
side a few years ago. I am doing my best
to nurture the Imperial/Mary’s team
ethos. Veteran squash doubles pairing
of Williams/Crofton is still undefeated
in Cardiff!
Hockey 4
Imperial College wins three out of the four
hockey fixtures whilst drawing the Mens
2nds match. The Mens 1sts match finishes
with a thrilling round of sudden death after
the score stood at 2-2 after normal time.
Football 6
Imperial College Mens 1sts thrashes the
Medicals, putting five past them. The 2nds
fixture is tighter but IC proves the stronger
of the two teams.
Basketball 7
Netball 10
Imperial Medicals come out on top in every
one of the four Netball fixtures. The 1sts and
2nds matches go right to the wire but the
IC 3rds and 4ths struggle to put up quite as
much of a fight
The Medicals came out on top in each of the
Netball fixtures, but the basketball results
were an entirely different story. IC thrashes
the Medicals almost by 100 points in the
womens’ fixture.
Lacrosse 7
Imperial College sends the Medicals flying
into the dust, winning 15-3.
Rugby 12
Only the women’s report, where they beat
the Medicals 15 - 7. The Medicals beat both
Imperial sides, with the 3rd team utterly
defeating Imperial 43 - 0
Water Polo 12
Imperial Medicals drowned out by the
unstoppable Imperial College team resulting
in a 10-1 thrashing.

JPR Cup 8
