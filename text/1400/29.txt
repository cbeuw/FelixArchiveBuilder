Netball
1sts team netball battle it out to the bitter end
Medics just squeeze past IC ladies 2nd
After some intense discussion the day
before about team plans and tactics the
Imperial Netball 1st team finally had
their team sorted out. With the loss of
our 1st team GS through injury in the
BUSA Cup match the week before, the
girls were nervous about how the new
arrangement would perform. How-
ever, after a good warm up the girls in
blue took to the court for the biggest
rivalry game of their season against the
IC Medics.
The first whistle blew and the game
began. Throughout the first quarter
IC showed great control, and although
the game was slow the girls were work-
ing hard to stay composed and not to
throw the ball away. Some excellent
interceptions by the defence,and great
shooting from the attack left the Impe-
rial ladies up by four goals at the end of
the first quarter.
The second quarter was much like
the first with the shooters in both
teams never missing a shot and the
centre court players refusing to make
a mistake which could cost them an in-
terception. The defence battled hard at
both ends, trying to capitalise on any
dropped balls or inaccurate passes, but
there were few opportunities and by
the end of the first half the score was
17-19 to the Medics.
With some small changes to the at-
tack in the third quarter, both teams
picked up the pace of the game and
mistakes started to show through lack
of concentration and over-excitement.
The roar of the supporters was deafen-
ing and the atmosphere grew and grew
within the sports hall as the Medics
slowly pulled ahead of the Imperial
girls. They continued to work hard and
made up to their previous mistakes
in the game through interceptions;
however, the IC medics defence made
some great interceptions and by the
end of the third quarter the Imperial
ladies were down 25-29, leaving it all
up to the last quarter.
The IC girls showed great deter-
mination, continuing to never miss a
shot and coming very close to inter-
ceptions. It was an agonising quarter
to watch with the girls in blue being
twelve goals down at one point in the
quarter. Through the defence and at-
tack they were able to bring it back to
two and with only 3 minutes to go, with
the crowd of supporters cheering both
teams, the Medics pulled ahead again
by two goals leaving the final score at
the whistle as 38-42.
On behalf of the team I would like to
thank all the supporters that came to
watch the game, the umpires and scor-
ers, and the IC Medics for a great game.
I would also like to say how proud I am
of the team and the way they played
throughout the game; although it was
not the result some were hoping for, it
was a great achievement and I couldn’t
have asked any more of you all.
It has been an amazing season for us
and I would like to say that those of you
that are leaving us this year (you know
who you are) will be greatly missed and
your contributions to the club have
been amazing and it will not be the
same without you!
After an interesting season which saw
the Imperial Netball 2nds firstly lose
their GS to the 1st team which resulted
in having to take the 3rd team shooter,
they then lost their captain who had to
pull out due to work commitments …
and all this with a team that is made up
primarily of freshers!
And so, the annual clash arrived
and all was set for the IC 2nd team to
play the Medics 2nds. After losing by
only one goal earlier in the season, we
knew it would be a tight match. From
the outset it was close, with a neck and
neck score at the end of the first three
quarters (16-16).
During the fourth quarter the victory
could have gone to either team, but un-
fortunately the Medics pulled away to
a two-goal lead in the last few minutes.
The final score was 24-22 to the Impe-
rial Medics.
A special congratulation should go
to Anna Haslop (GS) for her consist-
ent and accurate shooting. A mention
should also go to Jakie Fok who was
awarded twat of the match for nearly
doing the splits in a spectacular slide,
thank you to Ethos for over-polishing
the floor, made play so much easier!
So, after a tightly fought match, we

Well…
what a
season
and it’s
very
nearly
all over!
The 1st
team
won
their
BUSA league unbeaten and
has been promoted – CON-
GRATULATIONS GIRLS!
The 2s have played well all
season and were unlucky in
BUSA, but still have a chance
to win their ULU league and
be promoted – Come on,
girls! The 3s have had some
interesting games and results
with a higgledy-piggledy
team, but have had lots of
netballing fun at the same
time.
As a club, we’ve had way
too much fun dressed as cats,
horrible things for Halloween,
the Nativity (legendary), and
cheerleaders. We’ve even
“organized” a Valentine’s Pub
Crawl, which went from the
Union Bar to DaVinci’s and
back again – whoops! And in
doing all this, we’ve created
far too much gossip for even
me to handle!
This year’s Varsity was the
most intense that I’ve been
involved in. The hype leading
up to the day was almost un-
bearable. The gym has been
packed every lunchtime since
Christmas with competitors
from various sports (one in
particular, they know who
they are!) trying to reach the
peak of fitness at the right
time.
I got up that morning feeling
physically sick, I even strug-
gled to eat – which is very
unlike me – all day. It seems
strange that a game with only
pride at stake can affect you in
that way. But that is the beau-
ty of Varsity, one day where a
few games of sport matter to
1000s of people who usually
just don’t give a damn!!
Although the results at Var-
sity didn’t go our way and left
us heartbroken (especially
me!), I just want to say how
proud I am of every single
member of my club for the
passion they showed on
court and their dignified con-
duct off court on the day.
These last two years as
Netball Club Captain have
been out of this world (al-
most literally some Wednes-
day nights!), and I want to
thank everyone who has both
helped and supported me in
this time – you know who you
are!
And I love you all girlies –
even if you can be a pain in
the ass sometimes! x x x

Captain’s Corner
look forward to not only seeing you
again at Varsity next year, but in the
BUSA league as well.
The wing defender is not letting the medic get her hands on that ball
I couldn’t find the next shot, so I’m not sure if it actually went in
