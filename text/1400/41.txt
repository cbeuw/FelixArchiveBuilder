Music
horrible but I think it works.
What’s worse, being blind or
deaf?
Saul: I’d rather be blind. No. I’d rather
be deaf even though I’m a musician.
How can I face not being able to see
him [Joe] everyday? I’d have to kill
myself.
Joe: I’d be blind.
How can you live without music?
Saul: Easy. You can watch music videos
with speech on TV.
What is your favourite takeaway?
Saul and Joe agreed: Chicken burger…
Fried chicken…Caribbean takeaway.
That’s what we are going to go for.
The band deep in concentration, engrossed in their toys, fingers doing the talking. That is a helluva dirty camera lens
What’s your most embarrassing
moment in life if you don’t mind
sharing?
Saul: I was caught doing it with my
girlfriend on the sofa and her parents
came back and saw us through the
window.
Joe: We were playing a gig in Skegness
and I passed out backstage. I was com-
pletely out of it, I was wearing a pair
of gold Elvis glasses and some drunken
chavs came and put stuff on my head.
The video is now on YouTube. It was
pretty embarrassing.
What superpower would you like
to have?
Saul: I would like to turn sideways and
disappear. I’m getting there, I’m quite
thin.
Joe: Mine’s really boring. I would like
to fly. I have had loads of dreams where
I’m flying.
Have you guys ever played pranks
on teachers?
Saul: Not really pranks man. I once
threw a computer at a teacher. An as-
sault not a prank. I would have liked
to have played pranks but I couldn’t
have got away with it. It was too hard.
I would have liked to put pins on their
chairs.
Joe: I set a classroom table on fire once
whilst the teacher was in the room. I
used Tippex to set it on fire.
Did you get kicked out of school
then? Were you troublemakers?
Saul kisses the microphone whilst a happy chappie laughs away...
Gig review
The Metros
Barfly Camden
Pecknam boys blasting the night away at Barfly
Barfly Camden, ‘tis the place to
‘glimpse the stars of the future.’ Help-
ing to launch careers of many stars
like Coldplay, Franz Ferdinand and
Badly Drawn Boy, it’s no surprise
that The Metros have chosen this
spot, having their eyes set on mak-
ing it to the big time.
Whilst the night was still young,
Toddla T, from the same record la-
bel (1965 Records) as the boys from
South London, hit the stage with his
funky dance/elctronics/house mix-
ing and dexterous DJ manoeuvres.
At the strike of 10pm, The Metros
finally had their showtime after what
seemed like an eternity in sound
checks. Anticipation and excitement
in the air. That’s what it was. The
crowd was buzzing. A sold-out gig at
Barfly. What more can you expect?
The night could not pass without
getting entangled in the mosh pit.
Fun. Fun. Fun. If you didn’t mind be-
ing catapulted across the room and
shoved in all angles with beer spilled
down your top or bottom.
Fists were pumping, arms flail-
ing, hips rolling, spirits were high as
fans were bowled over by the brazen,
feisty performance. Those that knew
the songs pretty well sang along joy-
ously, those that didn’t, well, we half-
sang and simply cheered like crazy.
Mind you, the five knew their stuff and
they sounded terrific. If you like The
Libertines, I think you’ll take a strong
liking to this bunch from Pecknan as
they are wild and wicked in spirit and
sound. Saul, the lead singer, boy, did he
know how to set the place on fire! Both
he and the rest of the band exuberated
energy, passion and experience be-
yond their years. Rocking to and fro on
stage, kings of the castle. Quite some-
thing. Just shows one should use youth
to one’s advantage, i.e. unleashing the
torpedo of energy and dynamism while
we can before we get burdened and
tied down with biggies like marriage
and children. No; we adolescents are
the way forward.
The vocal delivery was outright can-
non fodder. Frontman Saul rocked the
night away, retelling cautionary tales of
teenage life in London with unabated
zest. With equal doses of enthusiasm,
the bassist and guitarists interjected
reinforcement with harmonious yells
and shouts. What a downright eu-
Saul: I did get kicked out of school.
Yeah, I was a troublemaker.
How did you do in school?
Saul: GCSEs is as far as I got.
Joe: I’ve got about seven GCSEs. I did a
couple months of sixth form and then
I didn’t go. Didn’t bother to tell them I
was leaving. Then I just hung out with
him (Saul).
Which track are you most proud
of?
phonic racket. Now and again on
stage, you’d see Saul taking a swig
of the bottle. Fired up by the liquor,
the singing got louder and the crowd
became merrier and merrier. Songs
fuelled by the school system seemed
to get the crowd’s acknowledgement
as quite as few were indeed teens
out on a school night-’Education is
overrated, and I’m the monster that
it created.’ References to Pecknam
to crime and ASBOS are featured in
their songs- ‘He got in trouble with
law, put in jail ‘til 2004,’ I think the
boys know a thing or two about be-
ing kicked out of school and causing
mayhem, having lived with crime on
their doorsteps most of their lives.
One must not forget to mention the
catchy scaling bass lines, rhythmic
guitars and upbeat drumming which
did do the rest of the talking. The
Metros finished on a high with their
soon to be released single ‘Education
Pt2’ with the fans singing along tri-
umphantly. Everyone was won over
by the energy that the guys brought
on stage. Strutting and rocking about
like nobody’s business.
The Metros are certainly a train
ride well worth catching.

Saul: There’s this song called Ra Ra Ro-
lands on our forthcoming album that
I’m proud of.
Your new single is about educa-
tion. Tell us more about it?
Saul: I wrote it when I was 16, when I
got kicked out of school. It’s going to
be released soon, March 17th. Our al-
bum is coming out this summer.
Thank you boys
