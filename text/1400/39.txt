Total Film and Sky Movies Red Carpet Preview 2008 - Competition

hind-the-scenes and unseen
footage, messages from cast
and crew, the Total Film Mag-

es and video messages from
special guests to showcase
the best of the coming year
in cinema, including The Dark
Knight, Indiana Jones and the
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,
Sex and the City, Prince Cas-
pian and Hellboy 2.
London sessions will also
have the chance to get their
face on the cover of Total Film
