First, a few words to non-
members—see a shrink. (Don't get
smug you members; you're beyond
help.)
Seriously, I'd like to apologise for
the lack of lights in half the Club. It
took five weeks of non-stop nagging
to get Repairs to send us a team.
We've suffered recently from non-
members hogging the tables and
also from a lot of vandalism. To try
The Greater London Club is a social
and educational club which caters
for a large variety of tastes. As the
end of term approaches we have
become much busier. Visits in the
coming week include a trip to the
100 Club on Sunday December 4 to
see the Big Town Playboys, a trip to
ITV Studios to see This is Your Life
on Wednesday December 7, a
Casino trip and a visit to Ronnie
to deal with both problems, we've
asked RCC for an extra £600 to fit
light meters, with tokens for
members. Others will have to pay
for lights on a table giving the Club
more money for the up-keep of the
tables and equipment.
Comments and suggestions for
further improvements to me, Saif
Ghouse, Chem Eng 2.
Scotts on Thursday December 8. So
far this term the Club has organised
trips to the City, the Old Bailey,
stockcar racing, Jongleurs,
Greyhound Racing and a lot others.
We've got a lot of lively trips coming
up so anybody out there who does
not feel their social life is up to much
come and join us. Membership is
£1.50 and gives you a discount on
most club visits of at least £ 1 .

Student Loans. In accordance with
Union Council policy the Union
now has three copies of the
Government's White Paper 'Top-
Up Loans for Students'. I have read
this document and am in the
process of producing a briefing
paper which will outline the
Government's proposals and also
endeavour to explain how these will
affect students of this College. This
should be out in department's on
Monday. There will be an
Emergency Union General Meeting
on Thursday 8th December to
discuss the proposals and also to
decide on the Union's response.
NUS Demonstration. A few people
have commented that they thought
the Exec Committee were wrong not
to go on the demonstration
organised by the NUS. I think the
activities of the students on that
march really summed up why the
Exec were not prepared to take part
in such a farce.
Alcohol Awareness. Today is the
last day of Alcohol Awareness
Week. I hope that some of you have
tried the low alcohol alternatives
that have been on promotion in the
Union Bar. Some of you may even
try them again in the future, you
never know! The next phase of
Welfare '89 takes place between
January 9th and 13th when the
subjects covered will be AIDS,
sexuality and homophobia.
Transport. Just recently Surf Club
were fined £24.70 for failure to
return a van on time and for lying
to me about when it was returned.
They were also charged £14 for the
extra administration costs incurred.
This came about because the Club
had not bothered to check whether
the van was required when they
returned it and they were not sure
of the Transport Procedures. If
anyone else is unsure of the
procedures then ask Kathy or
myself. Transport Committee does
not accept ignorane as an excuse!

Rent Strike. I was rather disturbed
to read in the report of Council that
I was wimping out of the rent strike
originally planned for next term. I
feel that it would be a little
unreasonable for us to pressurise
College further when they appear to
be taking positive steps towards
transferring monies from overseas
fees to the residence account
pending enquiries to the University
Grants Committee.
Student Loans. A number of people
have come up to me and said 'You
don't care, you git' because I didn't
go on the march last week.
The reasons that I missed the
march were namely:
a) That the organisation at the
Imperial end was at short notice.
b) That I hadn't yet obtained and
read the White Paper on the loans.
c) I do not think that it was the
best way to change the
Government's decision.
I am very concerned about loans
and welcome any suggestions as to
how the Union can best defend
students finance.
Last but not least, don't forget to
see the Jets tonight as they are
absolutely brilliant! Up yer bum,
