ORIENTEERING
Fog
Hazard
Last Sunday the Orienteering Club
made its way to Brandon Park in
East Anglia to compete against
Oxford and Aston in the Churchill
Cup. As we travelled North out of
London we found a landscape
covered in frost and the event area
was lightly sprinkled with snow, it
may have been cold but no one
could deny the beauty of the
scenery.
All the IC competitors completed
their courses, and some good times
were recorded, as a team we beat
Aston, and lost to Oxford (who are
one of the best University teams in
Britain), but most importantly
everybody had enjoyed themselves.
We then drove home stopping only
for tea at a hotel on the route.
S Q U A S H
League
Draw
Men's team draws with LSE 2-2
Playing one of the best teams in the
league without our regular number
1 (whom last we heard was on
crutches!), we managed to persuade
IC Football 1st team midfielder
Simon Colege to make a comeback.
He played an entertaining game
with plenty of angled shots and
extraordinary returns but lost out to
the LSE number 1, who is one of the
League's better players. Ming Tan
(no. 2) had to fight hard to win 3-2
although always ahead, and always
looked the fitter of the two. Rustom
Khambatta (no. 3) lost another close
3-2 match after being ahead for most
of the game. 'Old man of the team',
Martin Croucher (no. 4) was head
and shoulders above his opponent,
and a bit generous in giving his
opponent one game in his 3-1 win
(although he wasn't that generous
in the Bar later!).

good first game (even though we
borrowed a couple of players from
the 2nds) and the new Hockey Club
members showed lots of potential.
Goals came from Kaleem Ahmad
(2), Dave Millard(2), Avi Gupta and
John Prole. If we continue on this
form, it promises to be a brilliant
first season for the 4ths.
Anybody interested in playing
hockey this year for the 4ths can
sign up on the hockey noticeboard
(opposite the Union Bar) or get in
touch with Vijay Thakur (Physics

welcome.
C R O S S C O U N T R Y
Imperial
Challenge
The Cross Country Club is presently '
involved in a close contest for the
leadership of the London Colleges
League. Lying in fifth place overall,
a solid performance was needed at
the third race of the series, at
Wimbledon Common, in order to
maintain our challenge. However,
the recent cold spell seemed to affect
the form of several runners. Our
first finisher was Frank Dudbridge
in 14th place, followed by Alex
Gaskell in a rather disappointing
49th. Matthew Lynas came 52nd,
showing once again that this sport
is where his true talent lies and that
he should give up orienteering
immediately. Our other scoring
runners were Dave Knight 67th,
Pete Smith 68th and Stefan Ledin
74th.
We didn't manage to scrape a
women's team together this time,
but it didn't stop Steve from
walking around behind the St
Mary's ladies and finishing in a
pathetic 133rd place!
A few days later we entered three
teams for the Reading University
Relays. The men's teams finished
27th and 35th, the women's was
imcomplete although the two
Alisons braved the cold and ran
respectable times. The fastest men's
runners were Frank Dudbridge
(12'47 and 13'23) and Alex Gaskell
(13'20). Dave Knight also performed
heroics by running two legs.
Stefan Ledin (13'29), Bill Skailes
(13'33) and Ramin Dilmaghamian
(14T4) completed the teams.
Club members meet for training
at lunchtimes (12.30pm) in the
Union Gym. Athletics training takes
place at Battersea Park at 3.30pm on
Wednesday, and 11.00am on
Sunday. Anyone interested in
joining in the sport is encouraged to
come along.
SAILING
Battle at Oxford
After a re-match against City
University on Thursday in which
the team's honour was stoutly
defended by Paul and Charles. The
team gathered early on Saturday
morning to do battle at Oxford
against both Brunei University
teams and Oxford 1st teams. A
slight lack of wind led to a rather
slow • start, but when the
competition began Rory and Liam
went as if on rails, and were first
home easily. The commodore,
Richard, was having problems with
exhaustion, caused by a lack of sleep
the night before and he was looking
a little low. Unperturbed, in the
second race he overcame this and
was also able to provide a good
finish. So, after two races and two
draws, Bill and Carol, who by now
had warmed up considerably, came
to the rescue in the last and pulled
their boat into the lead and held it
to the end. This gave us a well-
deserved win over Brunei's 2nd
team. At this point racing was
abandoned for the day due to lack
of wind, the search for a pub with
a telly showing the rugby match
then began....of which more next
week.
