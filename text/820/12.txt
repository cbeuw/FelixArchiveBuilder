Al Stewart
Dominion Theatre
It takes a certain type to be an Al
Stewart fan. There we sat, all of us
bearded and wearing scruffy
greatcoats re-living the early
seventies when folk rock was still a
viable form of music. Us folkies are
a queer lot, friendly to each other
whilst eagerly awaiting someone
who hasn't toured for four years
and hasn't had a hit record for
eleven. (Year of the Cat, the record
that everyone's older brother has a
copy of and must have been the
thing to persuade Johnny Rotten to
take up punk). Al is back with a new
record company, a sixpiece band
(unnecessary as the best songs are
his solos) and a new album which
is hailed as the eighties classic
(whatever that means), and could
have been written at any time since
about 1965.
Of course he played lots of YOTC
and one or two of his other notable
ditties, tastefully updated to give the
band something to do. We all
shouted out requests and he even
played one or two 'cos he likes to
give us punters what we want.
There was no pretentious light
show, probably because he can't
afford it any more although his
saxophonist was wearing a totally
pretentious pair of leather trousers
and a courgette which more than
made up for the lack of effects.
Sexy Al Stewart
Everyone had a solo spot, but
Peter White had lots as he can play
the Spanish guitar and this fits in
well with the soft-rock songs. We
even had a special guest appearance
by some guitarist who plays with
Marianne Faithful and who I've
never heard of. So we all had a
happy evening reliving the
seventies and went home to our
bedsits to contemplate why Neil
Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys sounds
just like our Al and makes much
more money.

The Coltranes
St Vitus Dance
An old warehouse, a vaulted cavern
in Liverpool's deserted Stanley
dock. Wet outside and misty in,
pods of light half-illuminating
shadowy figures; a scene from a
New York alley, steam rising from
the grates, tension in the air before
a rumble. -
The event is the Liverpool
University Architects Party,
students are milling around, there's
something in the air tonight. A bar
at one end, a stage and some tables
improvised from wooden things
which hang around old
warehouses.
The rumble commences. The first
contenders are St Vitus Dance. Six
men on a less than generous stage,
it is like Kooi and the Gang on a
matchbox. The songs punch out
thick and fast, constantly beating
you until you acknowledge the
band. They're an Irish band so they
play the obligitary ballad, but even
that had something special about it.
This band are on the sincere side of
jangly pop.
Next there is an intermission
disco, more students amble to the
dancefloor, sensing more action.
The stage is rearranged, the bar is
visited and then The Coliranes arrive.
The Bristol band do not put up as
good a fight as their predecessors.
Another indie band, they do the
trick of merging in with all the other
indies available. The sameness of
The Coitranes, apart from the odd
bright spark, makes a light
anticlimax to the event.
With everybody gone the
warehouse looks like a desert with
tumbleweed crisp packets blowing
around and the smell of lager from
every surface. Had to imagine that
in a few hours it will be the site of
a market.

Jessye
Norman
Imagine an ample but graceful
woman with an assured air and you
would have a fair idea of what
Jessye Norman looks like; but if you
hear her voice you will realise why
some of us worship her.
Firstly, she is power-ful, not only
in volume but also in her ability to
capture the attention of an audience
completely. Those who have seen
the French film Diva will have
experienced this spine-tingling
rapture. Her enunciation is perfect
in at least three languages other
than English, so that those who
don't have any German can still
appreciate the beautiful sounds of
Goeth's poetry. She can
communicate the emotion behind
the words, so that we are swept
along into the music and feel, with,
her, excitement or melancholy.
If you want to hear her for
yourself, here are three recordings
that I recommend highly:
1. Schubert: Lieder Philips 412
623-X
2. Brahms: Lieder Deutsche
Gramaphon 413 311-X
3. Les Chemins D'Amour Philips
416 445-XPH
The first two are collections of
German songs and the third of more
modern French songs. Each song is
only 2-3 minutes long and the mood
alternates between fiery-fast and
mellow-subdued. You are bound to
find some favourites here, though
if you are new to the world of
classical music the Schubert and
Brahms are safer buys. For Jessye-
junkies, however, Les Chemins will
be a real shot in the arm, with its
jilted modern melodies mixed with
simple French charm. There are lots
of twentieth century goodies hereâ€”
Poulenc, Duparc, Ravel, and a very
witty song by Satie. The most
beautiful is probably the title piece
which could make a rugby player
cry.

ICSO
The ICSO produced a concert of
their usual high standard, despite
the disruption of their rehearsal
schedule by their performance at the
College's Merger Ceremony. The
opening piece, Mussorgsky's Night
on the Bare Mountain, a little scrappy
in places, but nevertheless played
with the vigour and intensity
necessary for the piece and was very
enjoyable.
Geoffrey Silver was the soloist in
the Sibelius Violin Concerto. A
mathematics students at Imperial,
he has played at the Royal Festival
Hall and was the leader of the
National Youth Orchestra for two
years. His performance was of the
-highest calibre and, ably supported
by the Orchestra, this was the
highlight of the evening for me.
Richard Dickens produced, as
always, an excellent performance
from the Orchestra for a packed hall
and that will add to the many others
that have encouraged me to listen
to these talented musicians at every
opportunity.
