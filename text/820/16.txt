IC Student
Arrested
Thirty students from Imperial
College attended the 'Loans'
demonstration on November 24 that
became uncontrollable and led to
widely reported violent scenes on
Westminster Bridge.
Imperial students reported that
the demonstration was disciplined
but badly organised with too few
NUS stewards. Colleges and
universities throughout the country
were represented and the NUS had
expected less than two-thirds of the
15,000 students attending.
The NUS believes Socialist
Workers' Party students featured
strongly among a break-away group
that was deliberately confrontational
and provoked a cavalry charge from
mounted police.
Students marched from ULU in
Malet Street across Waterloo Bridge
to an assembly point at the Imperial
War Museum. The students
continued to Westminster Bridge
but were informed that they could
not enter Parliament Square.
Imperial students reported that
the police tried to clear the bridge
but there was nowhere to move to.
Ugly scenes ensued and 69 people,
including one IC student, were
arrested.
Booze
Blues
'Alcohol Awareness', this term's
Union Welfare Campaign
culminates today, with the
appearance of a liver testing
machine in the JCR and Union
Snack Bar.
All Council 'hacks' have been
mandated to undergo a test
rumoured to be the result of Nigel
Baker's concern for their health.
Today features the promotion of low
alcohol drinks in the Union Bar.
The liver testing machine detects
the presence of an enzyme
particularly susceptible to alcohol
and indicates any liver damage.
Nigel Baker told FELIX that there!
had been a good response to the
leaflets placed around College this
week.
Campaigns planned for next term
are on AIDS, Social Security and
drugs. The Union hopes to have the
results of 1,200 welfare surveys for
the new Welfare Officer to plan the
campaigns for IC students.
A P B o r e d ?
A motion calling for an editorial
board to be set up to control the
content of the Alternative
Prospectus was carried
unanimously at Tuesday's Union
General Meeting.
The motion called for an editorial
board consisting of the IC Union
and Constituent College Union
Academic Affairs Officers, an editor
and four randomly chosen members
of Council. Under the motion, the
editor will be responsible for the
production of the publication, but
the content of the Prospectus will be
the responsibility of the committee.
Proposing the motion, Deputy
President, Chas Brereton pointed
out that editors in the past had been
'victimised' by those departments
who were unhappy with their write-
ups in the Alternative Prospectus.
He pointed out that an editorial
committee would ensure that any,
articles written were factual and
pointed out that this year's
Alternative Prospectus Supplement
had to be rewritten and reprinted at
a cost of £1,000 to the Union because
of factual errors.
Following a procedural motion by
President Nigel Baker, the
discussion of two motions on
student loans was postponed until
an Emergency General Meeting on
Thursday next week. Mr Baker said
that this would allow him to
circulate a paper he was writing on
Student Loans.
The wacky boys and girls from
Imperial College Dramatic Society
will be presenting their version of
"The Nerd' next week. The play, a
side splitting comedy, is written by
Larry Shue and was first made
famous by Rowan Atkinson in 1984.
It can be seen in the concert hall at
7.30pm from Tuesday December 6
to Saturday December 10.
Admission is £2.00 from Tuesday to
Thursday and £2.50 on Friday and
Saturday.
Indsoc Dinner Scandal
Industrial Society held a free
dinner for its members last Friday
] paid for out of the profits from the
Careers Fair.
A spokesman said the Fair
generated £8,000 of which £1,500
will pay for typesetting the Careers
Fair Brochure, the cost of which was
'under estimated.'
The Indsoc chairman stated that
£2000 would be spent on the dinner
at £25 per head - justified by 900
man hours of work.
Nigel Baker told FELIX that it didn't
seem very moral but there waf
nothing he could do about it.
Non-grant income from any society
can be spent without recourse,
however, next year's Careers Fair
profits will be controlled by the
Industrial Relations Committee so
the issue will not arise again.
This year's Careers Fair disrupted
the Rag Week for which a £500
donation was made in recompense.
A Careers Fair organiser
suggested that profits of up to
£18,000 could have been achieved
by increasing stall charges and
advertising rates, without
decreasing the number of
companies participating.

Rescued
College Finance and Executive
Committee postponed plans to sell
Montpelier Hall last week.
ICU President Nigel Baker
favoured proposals to sell
Montpelier, which requires £230,000
upgrade, in order to provide more
accommodation in a less salubrious
area than Knightsbridge.
The Committee noted that a
property worth £4-£5 million could
prove difficult to sell as the current
high mortgage interest rate may
deter buyers.
Montpelier Hall provides accom-
modation for 100 postgraduates at
IC.
And
Finally...
The Rag game 'Killer' was
completed last Thursday in a 'wild-
west' style gun fight. Over fifty
people originally joined the 'circle
of death' and around £100 has been
raised for charity. Each person was
contracted to assassinate another
player. This could be accomplished
in a variety of ways, but were
generally shootings. Once a killer
makes an assassination, he then
carries out his victim's contract,
until one person is left.
The sole survivor was Karl Edwin,
having twelve kills to his credit, he
receives first prize.
Second prize went ot Claude
Beazley with eight kills. The third
prize was awarded to Dave Woods
for the 'most interesting kill', he
decapitated one of his victims with
a scyth, while impersonating a
'Grim Reaper'.
