IN THE
British Airways' latest 150-seat
airliner, which entered service at the
end of April, promises to improve
air safety by taking advantage of
recent developments in electronics
technology.
About 75% of all air transport
accidents have pilot error as a
significant contributory factor.
Computers aboard the Airbus
Industrie A320 reduce the likelihood
of errors being made by reducing
pilot workload, and also by
physically preventing him from
exceeding the limits of the

aeroplane.
Externally, the A320 looks
deceptively ordinary. But the use of
digital computers to control the
plane and monitor the multitude of
systems on board makes it, in its
own quiet way, as revolutionary as
Concorde was in the 1970's.
Passengers invited to see the flight
deck could be forgiven for thinking
that they had mistakenly stumbled
across an in-flight amusement
arcade. Gone are the thousands of
dials and switches which
characterised previous generations
of airliner cockpit. In their place lie
six multi-colour cathode ray tubes-
seven inch square TV screens
which, instead of displaying the
latest space invader game, provide
the pilot with his speed, height and
heading information.
Behind the instrument panel
computers are at work, ensuring
that information is presented to the
pilot in the most efficient way
possible. The improved ergonomics
reduce crew workload significantly,
thereby contributing to the saftey of
the aircraft and its on-time arrival
and departure. Besides flying the
plane, the crew needs to monitor or
control engines, fuel, hydraulics,
air-conditioning, electrics,
pneumatics, auxiliary power, and
several types of radio and
navigation equipment. While the
pilot was once expected to do many
of these jobs at once, he can now
concentrate on the most important
tasks and let computers monitor
other things. The passenger can be
reassured that the plane is
constantly checking itself; the A320
makes certain that no checklist item
can be overlookedâ€”which in the
past has so often been the cause of
disaster.
A central warning system alerts
the crew to the onset of
emergencies, and even displays the
procedure necessary to safely rectify
the fault. The pilot will be warned
if his fuel is too low, if an engine is
not running healthily, if he has
forgotten to lower the
undercarriage, and so on. Built-in
test equipment aboard the A320
provides 95% probability of tracing
a fault to a single component, which
can easily and quickly be replaced
as soon as the aircraft has landed.
A further striking feature of the
flight deck is the absence of the
pilot's conventional control column.
Instead, the pilot is provided with
a miniature sidestick, reminiscent of
the few visible clues that computers
also play a key role in helping the
pilot control the aeroplane.
The A320 is the first airliner to be
fully equipped with computer
driven 'fly-by-wire' (FBW) controls.
Dnlike conventional aircraft, the
pilot is not linked to the plane's
control surfaces by a mechanical rod
and cable system. Instead the pilot's
demands are converted into an
electical signal; this passes via a
computer to an actuator, which
moves control surfaces on the wings
and tail.
By moving the sidestick, the pilot
is effectively telling the aeroplane
where he wants to go. A powerful
computer, performing 3 million
operations per second, arranges for
the plane to move in this direction
by deflecting the appropriate control
surfaces. If necessary, the computer
may modify the aircraft's response
to prevent it from performing
potentially dangerous manoeuvres.
This system is invaluable in an
emergency situation, such as a near
miss, when A320 pilots can apply
full sidestick deflection instantly,
obtaining the maximum response of
the aircraft, without fear of stalling,
or physically damaging the airframe
by manoeuvring too violently.
The A320, like most modern
airliners, is equipped with an
'autopilot', which automatically flies
the plane along a set route, and is
usually only engaged during cruise.
In contrast, the FBW system is
designed to assist the pilot during
Science
critical phases of flight, such as take-
off and landing, when an autopilot
could not match the ability of a
human pilot to cope with the
unexpected.
With computers performing such
important functions, designers have
had to ensure that component
failures or programming faults could
not result in catastrophe. The A320
features five man FBW computers,
and any one of four of these is
It is as revolutionary
as Concorde in the
1970's
capable of flying the aircraft
perfectly safely on its own. These
computers are of two different
types, programmed by different
companies working independently
from each other, to minimise the
risk of software faults affecting more
than one computer. Protection
against faults is such that the aircraft
can be dispatched with a failed
computer, go on to suffer other FBW
computer failures inflight,and still
remain completely and safetly under
the control of its pilots. A
mechanical back-up system protects
the aircraft from the consequences
of complete electrical failure.
Improved safety is only one of the
benefits of FBW. Civil airliners must
be specially strengthened to cope
with every eventuality, such as
extreme stresses arising from rare
violent gusts and turbulence in
storms. This insurance places large
weight penalties on aircraft
throughout their service life.
Thanks to sensors linked to the
FBW computers, the A320 can
detect conditions of severe
turbulence, and automatically
deflects the control surfaces to
counteract the 'stomach-churning'
sensation of a sudden up-gust. As
well as improving passenger
comfort in rough weather, the
reduction of loads imposed upon
the airframe enables substantial
weight savings to be made, allowing
more passengers and cargo to be
carried whilst consuming no more
fuel.
The benefits of using such
advanced technology have not gone
unnoticed. With nearly 500
commitments from 20 airlines, the
A320 is selling faster than any
airliner in history. The European
manufacturing consortium, in
which British Aerospace has a 20%
stake, are justifiably confident that
their latest product can threaten
American dominance of the 150-seat
airliner market.
