THE r.~ ... cR OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
What a Whoppa
The Mechanical Engineering
Department have begun work on a
very large candle. The candle is to
be burned next to the Albert
Memorial on December 10 in a
televised event designed to raise
money for the British Epilepsy
Association.
When complete, the candle will be
10 metres tall with a diameter of 1
metre. Seven tonnes of wax are
being used in the candle, which it
is estimated, could burn for a
month. The wax is being supplied,
free of charge, by Mobil Oil whilst
Thames Water Authority have
donated the pipe which forms the
mould. The wick, a ships mooring
rope, is being donated by a shipping
company in Bristol. The stress and
heat calculations for the candle have
been carried out by Dr Sean Crofton
of the Mechanical Engineering
Department.
It is hoped that celebrity Terry
Wogan will attend the candle
lighting ceremony in Hyde Park, the
event being broadcast in the TVS
programme 'Motormouth'. After the
ceremony, the candle will be slung
beneath a Chinook helicopter and
flown to the continent where it will
be used in other fund raising events.
Work on the candle was
temporarily halted yesterday when
technicians were unable to retrieve
the wick from within the mould.
The wick was eventually extracted
with the aid of a long hook and a
scafolding tower. A tanker of hot
wax was poured into the candle
mould behind the Mechanical
Engineering Building yesterday
afternoon. The wax will take a week
to solidify and shrink before the
mould can be removed.
Candlemaker, David Constable
commented 'I've never made one
this big before; the biggest one prior
to this was 20ft tall with an 8 inch
diameter'. Mr Constable is 92.
Mum's the word!

Refectories lose £22k shock
College refectories have made a
trading deficit of £22,000 over the
past financial year, it was revealed
at the House Committee last
Wednesday. The loss compares
with a gross profit of £73,000 for the
preceeding year. When asked how
the deficit had arisen Rob Northey,
Refectories Manager, was unable to
comment. 'If I knew, I wouldn't
have a problem', he told FELIX.
The Catering and Conference
Services Management Committee
appears to be attributing the loss to
rising salaries. Operating costs,
however, have fallen due to the
closure of the Main Dining Hall for
refurbishment. Although income
was up by 6% from last year, the
cost of food sold rose by 16%,
resulting in a 5.8% decrease in gross
profit.
Over the past six months there
has been extensive alteration of
refectory outlets, and the creation of
new ones, such as the Kebab Bar on
Southside. In the light of the
accounts for last year it is likely that
the contribution to the Refectory
Capital Programme for the
refurbishments will be of the order
of £20,000 rather than the forecast
of £157,000! This will inevitably
prompt a complete re-scheduling of
the repayments. Catering proved to
be the main source of deficit with a
loss of £70,000 as against a £35,000
profit last year. This is again a result
of the rising cost of salaries, despite
an incr.ese in turnover. The
Southside Shop also reported a
reduction in takings and profits
compared with last year.
Bars throughout College made a
4% profit, but again this is less than
last year, and not significant
compared with overall figures. The
first glimpse of optimism comes
with the accounts for' the cellars.
These are able to report a profit of
30% compared to a previous 9%.
Unfortunately they were incorrectly
budgeted for a 53% profit, the cost
of sales having been underes-
timated.
Mr Northey claims not to have
seen or had any information about
the accounts before Wednesday's
Committee meeting, and is unable
to take any action until the figures
have been fully audited and agreed
by the Catering and Conferences
Committee. His only comment on
the situation at present was T know
nothing. I see nothing.'
