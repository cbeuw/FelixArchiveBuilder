The Conquest of
the South Pole
Royal Court, Sloane Square
A promising and exciting idea. Four
unemployed young men a
backwater town in Germany decide
to recreate Amundsen's conquest of
the South Pole upstairs in the attic,
amongst the white sheets hanging
up to dry. We follow the trek
through the whiteness while real-
life tags along for the ride. As the
journey progresses, attitudes
change and mimic-ed hope and
goals take effect on the real lives
before us.
Unfortunately, The Conquest of the
South Pole fails to conjure these
promising ingredients into a
satisfying whole.
The . script skirts around its
subjects saying much but meaning
little, and without eloquence. There
is a certain feeling for rhythm in the
ebb and flow of the words, but the
humour is rather heavy-handed, the
wit lack-lustre, and most of the
potential pathos ignored.
In a play depending so heavily on
fantasy, while considering fairly
hefty issues (a picture of the impact
of youth, unemployment and, more
generally, humanity's terrible need
for a purpose in life), it is vita' that
the surrealism of the imagery be
countered by real substance, to give
a sharp edge to the glitter. This is
the problem with this production.
There is energy, enthusiasm and
ferocity, but left unfocussed it wafts
away with the cigarette smoke,
leaving behind no more than a
fleeting impression of vague
dismay. The characters rant and
stomp and weep, but never
progress, never break free from their
stereotypes. These people were not
unemployed, but unemployable.
The swaggering, black dad leader
was hollow, and his foil, a quiet,
. severe type, did not fulfil the
promise shown by his request that
they switch characters and play the
failures of the story—Scott and his
men. An annoying sniveller and
nondescript dowdy character
complete the main line-up.
The action progresses in a rather
haphazard fashion; dowdy gets a
job, but is intreated to continue the
play—acting. Employment, while
supposedly the main villain of the
piece, has virtually no effect upon
the characters when it strikes. This
puzzling phenomena is
disregarded, and all of a sudden we
join hollow swagger-boy. He has all
of a sudden tired of his role as
aggressive, cheerful leader, and is
overcome with unexplained'
• tears...but just as suddenly decides
that all is alright with the world
again because he has fathered a
child. The mother's refusal to
acknowledge him as father, his
complete inability to provide for the
child, and the presumably hostile
' environment into which it is being
delivered do not seem to enter into
the calculation.
The Conquest of the South Pole is a
disappointing production, sadly
giving the lie to the undoubted
potential of the concept. It is spoilt
by unsympathetic characterisation,
and a tendancy to shout for the sake
of style, rather than anger. What
could have been a moving and
entertaining serious comic piece is,
instead, more of a modern firework:
flashy, and without substance.

Scrooged
Cert PG
You get the impression from a film
like Scrooged that it was made more
for the sake of the Paramount
executives than the public. It's as if
these money men in suits sat
around a table one day deciding
what they could wheel Bill Murray
out for. Knowing that whatever he
does would probably bring in the
bucks, they sat back and built a film
around him.
In general, this film isn't at all bad,
but does seem rather artificial and
contrived.
The film is set in the TV world,
and in so doing makes some very
amusing comments along the way
about the tacky and patronising
schlock that occupies most of US
network TV.
A large network plans a truly
dreadful production of A Christmas
Carol—the type of thing the general
public go for (like the Royal Variety
Performance that I was unfortunate
enough to see the other day). The
man responsible for this is Bill
Murray (Ghostbuster, Stripes), who
plays the president of the network.
His character is the modern-day
scrooge; deriving pleasure in
sacking employees on Christmas
Eve and planning to exploit the
holidays for every rating point
they're worth. And so, in the best
tradition of the Dickensian classic,
he is visited upon by three
unwelcomed ghosts. The best of
these is easily Carol Kane as the
ghost of Christmas Present, a sugar
Frank takes a breath of fresh air
plum fairy who resorts to beating
people senseless to gain their
attention.
Also intertwined in the plot are
Karen Allen (Raiders of the Lost Ark),
as the romantic interest, Rob
Goldthwait (Police Academy 2, 3 and
4) as a fired executive; and Robert
Mitchum, excellent in the comic role
of the senile chairman of the board.
There are also several cameos from
American TV personalities such as
Lee Majors and John Houseman,
who send themselves up in
hilarious scenes.
Bill Murray is, of course, perfect
in his part. His irreverent humour
is always a joy to watch. His
presence alone is a good enough
reason to see the film.
The one real sour point in the film
comes at the end. Murray's
character changes too abruptly, and
delivers a schmaltzy speech about
Christmas, which is lacking any sort
of conviction. It is a moment that
Murray is uncomfortable with, but
in a moment of brilliantly wild
improvisation he turns it around.
In all, this is a 'feel good' movie
wrought with moments of
cringeworthy soppiness, but it is
good fun. I'll say no more. Go see
the film.
