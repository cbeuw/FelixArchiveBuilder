Opinion
Police brutality ?
Many of you will have read the
newspaper reports of last
Thursday's student protest against
'top up loans' or seen some of the
action on the television. Yet,
without having been there, you
cannot understand the feelings of
the students nor the extent of the
Police brutality against what was a
fundamentally peaceful demon
-stration.
1 was there and I got hurt, both
physically and emotionally, and I
would like to share with you my
experiences so that you will
hopefully grasp the situation a little
more than the average Imperial
College student or ICU executive
member seems to do at the moment.
About twenty-five members of the
college assembled at Beit Arch on
Thursday morning and travelled to
ULU to join a vast crowd of well
over the expected 15,000 students
who had travelled from all over the
country.
The feeling of the crowd during
the march South to the river was of
great enthusiasm for a cause that,
let's face it, would directly affect
very few of the participants. This is
something I have rarely experienced
at Imperial College, where the major
concern seems to be the size of one's
starting salary on graduation or the
price of beer in the Union Bar.
The march gave me some hope
that actually opposing the
introduction of student 'top-up'
loans might achieve something
beneficial for future generations of
students. As the vast majority of the
march left the agreed route at
Waterloo station, we were
determined to lobby our MPs at
Westminster.
We were not to know that thirty
Police horses and over 100 Police
Constables and Officers with four
riot vans were to meet us at the
south side of Westminster Bridge.
They were intent on not letting any
of us pass.
I got near to the front of the crowd
so that I could have some idea of
what was going on - the Police never
informed the crowd of anything. It
was not until the following day that
I discovered it is now illegal to
demonstrate within a mile of
Parliament when in session. Not
that the knowledge would have
stopped me or the other 10,000
students.
As it became apparent that the
Police were not going to let us
through, much of the crowd
decided to push through the Police
line. This was unorganised and
hence ineffective and generally in
ignorance of what was happening
to students at the front.
It would be an gross
understatement to say that the
Police were violent beyond the call
of duty. Indeed, they received no
provocation from the students - any
reports you may have heard about
a barrage of missies being hurled at
the Police is a complete fabrication.
It is true that about two dozen
placard poles were thrown in about
two hours, but since several of these
broke before the march had begun,
under the sheer weight of two
pieces of cardboard, they were not
incredibly harmful to the Police -
especially since most didn't actually
reach the Police line.
During five or six futile attempts
at breaking the Police line many
students were assaulted,
unprovoked, by the Police. At one
point, with both my arms visibly
trapped, a Policeman began to kick
me in the shins. It was unprovoked
and there was very little I could have
done to defend myself, and if I had
retaliated I would have been
arrested or suffered further assault.
My injuries required hospital
attention.
The assault ended as the
Policeman became involved in
.further scuffles. However, despite
being injured and not capable of
provocative violence, I was
subsequently kneed in the groin,
held in a neck lock and subjected to
much intimidating verbal abuse.
This was undoubtably intended to
make me decide that our peaceful
protest ought to disband.
In considerable pain I tried to
move back through the crowd. This
proved pointless as there were just
too many people and it was less
painful to simply stand still. I was
not allowed through the Police line.
I continued to witness quite
shocking Police brutality I even saw
a horseman make his horse turn
round and kick into the students.
Girls were grabbed by their hair and
pulled screaming through the
crowd. Black people were
preferentially snatched out of
groups of black and white students
shouting (justifyably) abuse at the
Police.
Yet, when Police became cut off
within the crowd, they were treated
courteously by the students.
Between crowd surges students
were seen to pat and stroke the
horses and peacefully protest our
case to the Police.
The final 'cavalry' charge of 25
Police horses at the packed crowd
of 10,000 was totally unreal. It came
without warning, and I was
fortunate to be at the side of the
crowd. But if it had not been for
fellow students pulling me out of
the way of the following wave of
Police on foot I would have suffered
further injury.
As it was, many of the Police
kicked, punched and jostled
students as we tried to disperse
from the area. The intimidating
abuse continued and many
indiscriminate arrests were made.
All of the students present were
quite stunned at what had gone on,
as were many onlookers, passeis-by
and, believe it or not, some of the
Police. I hope that the inquiry into
file affair highlights the Police
Force's unnecessary violence and
intimidation as the major cause of
the incident at Westminster Bridge.
I feel that if the Police had given
the students some positive option -
such as laying down our banners
and walking, as individuals, across
the bridge to lobby our MPs - then
the situation would not have
occurred.
Perhaps the NUS must take a small
proportion of the blame, but at least
they were prepared to inform their
members about the loans two weeks
ago and then organise some action
to defend the future of the education
system. Some 'independant'
Student Unions that I could
mention ought to be thoroughly
ashamed of themselves.
