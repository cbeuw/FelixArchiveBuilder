UTAH

Utah has something for everyone—
juniper deserts, lakes, pink or white
sand dunes, alpine moutainous
scenery, sandstone arches, sixteen
ski resorts and, of course, cities.
Cities I won't say much about
except that Salt Lake City is the
capital of Utah and the world
headquarters of the Mormon
Church. In southern Utah, one
seventh of all the national parks in
the USA lie within a 200-mile circle.
The climate is generally dry and
sunny—average temperatures in
winter and summer are 6°C and
31°C respectively, Utah is situated
in south-western USA, an area often
described as the Golden Circle of
Scenic and Vacation Lands.
There are five national parks in
Utah:
Arches—Over 200 sandstone
arches cut out of a flaming red
desert amidst towering cliffs, oddly-
shaped mountains and photogenic
gnarled old pinyon pines. Funny
how the gnarled trees never grew in
front of anything worth taking a
picture of, though.
The altitude is between 4,000 and
•5,600 feet, so hikers are advised to
take it easy if not used this type of
climate. There are trails here for
as 'Schoolmarm's Britches'—it looks
like a pair of legs).
Bryce— A hell of a place to lose a
cow' Ebenezer Bryce is said to have
remarked of his namesake. A
delicate labyrinth of fairytale-like
spires and columns and windows,
transluscent white and orange, is
best observed at dawn, when the
contrast between light and shadow
is greatest and a rosy tint is added
to the scene. The Paiute Indians
called these strange formations in
amphi-theatres of rock 'red rocks
standing like men in a bowl', and
believed that evil creatures were
turned to stone by a god in
retribution. Hiking, horseback
riding or moonlit walks are
available.
Canyonlands—The park boun-
daries lie around the confluence of
the Colorado and Green Rivers.
From Dead Horse point
breathtaking views of the Colorado
River goose-necks can be seen at
2000 feet above the valley. Cataract
Canyon is one of the most famous
white-water rafting areas on the
Colorado River. Needles, spires and
standing rocks are supposed to look
like Mad Ludvig's castles in
Bavaria—well....
Monument Valley
every level of hiker although in
every case plenty of water and
frequent rests should be taken. Park
rangers are only too happy to quote
the effects of dehydration of the
body.
If you only see one arch, be sure
to see Delicate Arch, (once known
Capitol Reef—Local legend has it
that Butch Cassidy hid here. Domes
capped with white sandstone
resemble the US Capitol, hence the
name. Other interesting features
include canyons and remnants of
the Colombian Indians of the.
Fremont Culture, eg petroglyphs.
Zion—Zion is part of the same
geological sequence of depositions
which formed the Grand Canyon,
125 miles to the south, and Bryce
Canyon. The Grand Canyon is the
• oldest; Bryce Canyon the youngest.
Zion canyon was probably carved
out of the rock by the Virgin River,
although this is a matter of some
dispute among geologists. Brilliant
red vermilian cliffs are crowned for
a third of their height by
shimmering white cliffs.
A highly recommended three-
hour walk is the strenuous five miles
to Angels Landing, a promontory
into the canyon. From here an
excellent picture of the valley can be
taken. Just when you think you are
nearly at the top for the hundredth
time, you suddenly realise that for
once the trail guide's warnings are
not at all exaggerated. You find
yourself clinging to flaking
sandstone and loose rusty chains
hammered into the stone, looking
at the knife-edge looming ahead or
the 1500ft sheer drop, amid gusts of
wind, and suddenly remembering
all those things in life you still
haven't done.
Also recommended is a trip to
Lake Powell—orginally a red desert
valley, the Glen Canyon Dam was
built across a narrow part of the
canyon and the valley accumulated
rainwater over ten years until it
reached the level it is today.
Lastly, the Great Salt Lake is well
worth a visit. A trapper named Jim
Bridger floated into it from Bear
River in 1824, and thought he had
reached the Pacific Ocean. It
appears a huge mirage above fairly
broken scenery. Its saline content is
about equal to that of the Dead
Sea—apparently it is quite
dangerous to swim in any sort of
wind as large crystals, carried by
waves can cause some harm. The
smell was enough to put me off!
Travelling Fares—Around £375
return to Salt Lake City via New
York. Try bucket shops but be wary.
Unless your name is Jack Kerouac
you'll need to hire a car—beware!
Check the insurance, and don't stop
to help anyone by the side of the
road—they are legally entitled to sue
you ii your help proves to be
inadequate. Your UK license is valid
for one year.
