The
Reviews
Bird
Bird-Charlie Parker, 1920-1954,
with Dizzy Gillespie, the innovator
of Be Bop, legendary saxophonist,
drug addict and alcoholic.
Clint Eastwood—tough guy hero,
occasional mayor, man with lofty
political aspirations and increasingly
thought of as one of the best
directors in America.
Eastwood shot Bird in a dark
moody way which is entirely suited
to the feel of the film and the jazz
clubs, bars andflatswhere most of
the action takes place. Flashback
form is used to tell Parker's story,
The Hidden
A thingy from outer space with a
craving for loud music, loose
women and gleaming Ferraris, takes
over the body of a mild-mannered
accountant and starts killing
everyone. This seems to be its
favourite hobby.
Enter Kyle McLaghlen (Dune, Blue
Velvet) as a body inhabited by a good
thingy from outerspace, out to do
away with the power crazy bad one.
But before he can close in for the kill,
the baddie alien has switched bodies
to a grandad with a heart condition.
And so the chase continues.
A soft landing in Paris
these flashbacks are seen as Parker
goes through the last few weeks.
During these weeks Parker attempts
suicide, faces drug withdrawal,
nervous, breakdown, bereavement
and professional disappointment.
Fairly catastrophic really. Bird does
have its high points; two scenes, a
Jewish wedding and a tour of the
Southern States are particularly
funny.
The flashbacks concentrate on
Parker's relationship with his wife
and a white trumpeter, as well as
Bird's struggle with drugs and
alcohol.
Parker's wife Cham is played by
Dione Verona who puts real feeling
into her fight to get Parker off heroin
and encouragement of his
professional life, he has numerous
affairs.
This all may sound like a
ridiculously naff sci-fi B movie, but
it is very well made and is great
entertainment. It never takes itself
seriously and there is plenty of light
comedy and dark humour.
Michael Noun plays an ail-
American, worldly-wise street cop;
the type that saves the city from
hoodlums before lunch. He feels
threatened by the young McLaghlen
posing as an FBI agent, but his
cynicism gives way to respect as the
story progresses.
There are probably some subtle
messages about today's society and
quips at politicians, but why bother
analysing these when the
All the performances are good and
the subject is approached in a
manner which, although barely
avoiding hero worship at times, has
a welcome lack of sentimentality.
Parker's rivals are often shown to be
bland and the film tends to gloss
over other problems Parker
encountered, particularly racism
which is only properly addressed in
one of Dizzy Gillespie's speeches.
At 2hrs 45mins long its length
would be a problem for those with
no interest in jazz, which ties the
scenes together. The score includes
Parker recordings with new backing
musicians to a superb quality and
this film cannot fail to spark a live
interest in the partially converted.

entertainment value is itself worthy
of attention.
The action segments are fast and
furious—the usual staple of blood,
car chases and explosions. This is
contrasted with sentimental looks at
the nicey-nicey normality of the
family of Noun's character. The
tongue-in-cheek humour, though,
makes the film watchable. The
publicity for the film likens it to
Robocop, which is unfortunate, since
it never approaches that standard.
Still, fans of the action film wouldn't
be disappointed and I'd recommend
this to anyone who feeds on a diet
of Schwarzenegger movies.

Commisar
Lumiere, St Martin's Lane, from
7th April 89
The Commisar, the first and only film
of director Alexander Askoldens,
was the surprise of the 1987 Moscow
Film Festival, where it was shown
for the first time since being banned
in 1967.
The story is set during the Russian
civil war between the Whites and
the Reds, in the 1920s. Claudia
Vainlova (Wonna Mardyukova) is a
tough, tank-like woman commisar
in the Red Army, who becomes
pregnant. To her fury, she finds she
has left it too late for an abortion,
and is billeted in the small home of
a poor Jewish artisan and his large
family. They resent her presence
every bit as much as she resents
having to leave her hard soldier's
life.
However, the resentment fades
with the coming of Claudia's child.
She fusses over it, so that Maria
(Raisa Niedashkovskaya), the
artisan's wife, comments to her
husband, 'Look! The Russian cares
for her child like a good Jewish
mother'. Behind the growing feeling
of warmth in the household is a
brooding tension. In childbirth,
Claudia sees her army lover being
shot, she sees the inevitable fate of
the Jews. Even the children at play
chillingly recreate the horrors.
As the White Russians begin to
encroach on the town, Claudia is
torn between remaining as the
feminine figure she has become,
and her devotion to duty as a Red
commisar.
The film is beautifully crafted with
fine performances from the leading
characters. Tight camerawork, by
Vallery Ginsburg, sets the pace of
the film, with rapid movement
between disturbingly large close-
ups in the action sequences and
lingering, soft shots in the family
home giving an impression of
peace.
But why was a film which had a
Red army commisar obviously
fighting the 'good' fight banned?
Coming as it did, after Russia's
major foreign policy embarrassment
in the Six Day War, it was the
Jewish elements of the film which
caused the problems. Askoldor was
locked out of the editing room and
banned from making any further
films when he refused to cut certain
scenes, and change the ethnic
origins of the family.
Thankfully, we can now see this
superb film in its full form, thanks
to Soviet glasnost, and I would
recommend it.
