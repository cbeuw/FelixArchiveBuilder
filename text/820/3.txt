FELIX
THE BARON OF
CHEAPSKATE
NUS March Fifteen thousand
students gathered in Westminster
last Thursday to protest against the
Governments planned introduction
of 'top up' loans. Scenes of violence
arose when three thousand of the
marchers left the official route and
clashed with Police as they
attempted to lobby Parliament.
The papers told of students
bombarding the Police with coins,
sticks and tins. Eye witnesses claim
incidents of Police brutality and the
indiscriminate use of Police horses
against the students.
It would be difficult to say,
without attending the march,
whether the students or the Police
were to blame.
Union President, Nigel Baker's
remark that 'the activities of the
students on the march summed up
why the exec were not prepared to
take part in such a farce' is at best
presumptuous.
The NUS, were at least prepared
to do something, and I am sure that
the President of the NUS did not
have to wait to be mandated by the
other Union Officers before she read
the White Paper on student loans.
What it all boils down to, of
course, is the President's reluctance
to involve the Union in anything
political. The Union is a service for
students and that's it.
The point is underlined by the
scheme Nigel has been considering
to rename IC Union IC Students
Confederation thus avoiding the
political implications of the word
Union.
The Baker Brothers, Kenneth and
Nigel have more than their names
in common - as those who listened
to Nigel drone incessently at the
private meeting between Kenneth
Baker and some 'typical IC students'
earlier this term will testify.
Perhaps Nigel shares the belief
often declared by the Secretary of
State for Education, that students
should concentrate on their studies
not on politics. It is an odd stance
from someone who ought to realise
that real education cannot come
from a text book.
It is quite apparent that students
in the 1980's, if they care about the
future of education and that of their
countrym, can no longer afford to
ignore politics.
Nor can the Union claim to be
looking after the welfare of the
students it represents when it does
not challenge issues such as student
loans head on.
It is very easy to burble about
being 'a responsible Union' whilst
sitting around and discussing these
issues at UGM's. But what does it
achieve? The march last Thursday
made a point which was noted by
the whole of the nation.

Phallix Editor, Willhebegoodfora-
columninch, was in afbad mood
again. Factory Society wanted
25,000 posters in two hours time
and he still hadn't finished reading
Mislam Society's latest article. He'd
decided to entitle it 'AH you need to
know about the Qu'ran in six easy
volumes', so that was a start. He
glared at the citizens in the Office,
shouted 'Bog off!', and hid under
his silly cloak. Some people thought
he was cracking up, but Wilhebe
knew better. They hadn't seen
anything yet!
In the Citizen's Office, Chief
Citizen, Little Lord Patacake, was
pacing up and down in his inner
sanctum. He rubbed his hands
together with glee as he thought of
the new Wealth Club he'd read
about in Phallix.
'Dave!' he shouted.
Dave Beandick, the Citizen's
Organiser scurried into the inner
sanctum, and jumped up onto a
seat.
'Give me your ideas on this
Wealth Club thing,' Patacake
snapped.
'Having made an assessment of
the profitability of the projected
forecasts, together with an index-
linked capital prediction I reckon for
this in a big way. This is the big
one,' said Beandick. T can get us a
good deal on 20,000 bath tiles, and
sixteen kettles. If we can train Kathy
Why-aye-mon quickly enough we'll
be quids in.'
'What? You mean?'
'Yes, a sexy sauna and massage
joint, in the style of the new citizens'
Hack Bar. Big queues, sweaty
bodies, and everything broken to a
pulp!' Beandick exclaimed.
Meanwhile, The Baron Derek
Dash was smiling as he flicked
through his holiday snaps. There he
was on the beach and there was
Mad Dash in Singapore patting the
dear little ex-citizens on the cheek.
There they were talking to a man in
uniform, in that funny country
where that little man in
Attenborough's film had stirred up
all that trouble. Derek stuffed the
photos into his drawer and made a
. mental note to go on holiday in
Britain next time.
The Baron picked up the phone:
'John Secretary? Come here a
moment, I want to discuss the
reportfromthe Committee set up to
decide about a meeting about the
possibility of a takeover, oops,
merger, with Royal Holloway and
Bedford Prison.
'You mean the report that doesn't
exist Derek? The one that you and
I have never seen,' smiled John
Secretary down the phone. John
Secretary saved his special smile for
talking to the Baron on the
telephone. It was more of a sarcastic
sneer really.
'Yes, that's the one,' the Baron
replied, 'It's on my desk. You did "
get your copy last week didn't you?'
Meanwhile, in the Hubby Office,
Mad Dash was having a wonderful '
time. Phallix had just printed her
press release and now she knew
that Hubby was worth every penny.
She felt so good, at least £10,000
worth of good, and the young
citizens' Christmas Party was still to
come...
.' Will Dave Beandick get his sexy sauna
and massage?
Can Willhebegoodforacolumninch get
any worse?
Will the Baron ever go abroad again?
Will little Lord Patacake persuade
Kathy Why-aye-mon to take a training
course in massage?
Why hasn't Wendy Haircut had a
mention so far?
When will the three clowns try to get
in on the act?...
Read the next gripping episode of the
The Baron to find out.
