controversy
Dear Sir
Last week you featured an article by Eric
Barnaby (Civ Eng Soc Chairman) about the
activities of the society, and I was very upset,
to see that you had titled the article 'Boring
Soc'. Civ Eng Soc is anything but boring; it is
the best society in college, offering a wide
range of events such as sight-seeing outings,
buffets, formal dinners, piss-ups, group sex
orgies and much more!
Yours sincerely
John M Ellis
Civ Eng III
Treasurer, Civ Eng Soc
Well done, Norm!
Dear Sir
Lunch in the Union lower Lounge, or
whatever it's called, forced me to rethink my
apathy policy concerning refectory meals.
Congratulations I C U ! The closest thing
I've had to food for two years.
London has already restored one' Old Vic';
how about IC replacing it?
Yours optimistically

Pinks in the sink
Dear Sir
Recent letters to 'Felix' highlight the ever-
increasing infiltration of Bolshevism
amongst our ranks.
In reply to M r C Bell we must point out
that while the soft soap's fragrance is
reminiscent of happier days; the pastel pink is
merely an insiduous mechanism to increase
our subconscious acceptance of the vile
political extremes this hue represents.
We implore 'Felix' readers everywhere to
boycott the soap and render this propaganda
ineffective.
And what is the link Bell, Bull,
Bolshevism?
Yours very very angrily

Comedy of errors
Dear Sir,
I think 4he writers of last week's comedy
and music reviews were being somewhat self-
indulgent. The music review was verbose,
difficult to read and basically uninformative,
while, in the comedy review, the
description of John Hegley as 'devastingly
cynical' gives a completely wrong impression
of this comedian, who does not take himself
too seriously. A friend told me that the
review just did not convey what the comedy
night was actually like. Also, anyone not
present on the on the night would find the
reference to the easy-rider motorbike
confusing.
Next time, please concentrate more on
creating an informative, readable review
rather than simply exercising the full breadth
of your vocabularies. That said, thanks for
taking the trouble to review them at all.
Yours sincerely
Dave Lock

Next week is the F E L I X Careers Special
Issue, and on Wednesday 31 October the
Industrial Society are holding their annual
Careers Fair.
On this occasion more than 60 companies
come and put up exhibits in the J C R and
Great Hall. It gives a good opportunity to see
how potential employers compare and you
can get an idea of what are your chances of
getting a job in a given field.
For final year Students the Careers Fair is
a must. But it's never too early for first and
second years to start thinking about careers,
seeing what is on offer and speaking to
employers' representatives. G o along to the
Careers Fair, and make the most of it.
F E L I X next week will contain articles and
features on topics such as interviews,
application forms, careers advice and so on.
Imperial College still hasn't got a team for
University Challenge. Are we really such a
bunch of thickies? There must be at least four
bright IC students who can be relied upon not
to humiliate the College infront of millions of
television viewers. So please go along to the
U D H at 1.00pm today to do a short paper of
sample questions.
