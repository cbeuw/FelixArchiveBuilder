Last Saturday, IC Hockey Club
1st XI travelled to Kodak for their
first League fixture. After a hard
fought game and some very
dubious umpiring, IC were
unfortunate to be on the wrong
end of a 1—0 scoreline.
C o l l e g e c e r t a i n l y h a d
o p p o r t u n i t i e s to s c o r e ,
particularly during a spell of
sustained pressure early in the
second half. A fine performance
in goal by Jonathon West
prevented a higher score for
Kodak, but overall this was a
game that IC felt that they could
have won, despite the fact that
they were a player short. College
put up a very brave effort and a
performance like this so early in
the season shows promising
signs for future matches.
Team: J West, A Stewart, P
Smith, K McCormick, N Collie,
P Oliver, M Hedges, J Baxter, N
Hope, and P Dubenski.
Hockey 2nd-Xl 13.10.84
IC 1- Mill Hill 2
On Saturday, in the first match
of the season, IC 2nds were
unlucky to lose a closely
contested match at home.
Despite fielding only 10 men, IC
scored first within 5 minutes of
the start. Mill Hill countered
strongly to go into a 2-1 lead at
half-time. After the interval, tight
defensive play from both sides
ensured no further score.
Goalkeeper Rolf Slatter made
many fine saves, thus keeping
the score respectable. The 5
freshmen in the side all played
well — a fact which augurs well
for the future.
Team: R Slatter, M Hall, L
Chownsmith, A Oliver-Smith, J
Stonham, D Wigney(Capt), J
Ward, C Akers, I Howgate, J
Sturgess, W Moore.

IC 3rd XI-6vs OMT's - 4
This first fixture of the season
proved to be an eventful and
enjoyable match. A half-time
score of 2-1 in College's favour,
was the result of two goals from
Dave and good goal-keeping by
Phil. In the second half goals by
Simon, Chris and two by Per led
to a final score of 6 - 4.Later in the
union bar we discovered we were
the only IC Hockey team to win!

Ladies vs LSE 10.10.84.
LSE cancelled; probably through
fear of a revived IC ladies team.
Therefore a 9-0 win (in theory).
Mens 2 us St G 10.10.84.
A tough away draw for the
start of the season which we
were unlucky to lose 5-4. We still
have high hopes of retaining
supremacy of this division
(winners 83/84) P Milne, C Bean,
S Cowperthwaite, R Shih, A
McAleer, A Martirossian
(Capt!!).
Ladies vs Guys 13.10.84
An enthusiatic performance
marred only by the fact that the
opposition failed to turn up.
Thanks to: Susanne Best, Julie
Goodeve, Helen Gregory, Claire
Mills, Sandra Rofe and Susan
Yates.
Mens Ist vs Kings 13.10.84
The Men's Ist Team started
with a 'bang' this season by
annihilating King's 7-2. Initial
S i g n s of s e v e r a l g o o d
partnerships looks well for the
rest of the season.
Team: Michael Bradley (Capt),
Ranjit John, M Chan, L Wong,
Chris Gaukroger, Ara
Martirossian.
ORIENTEERING
Hainault
Twelve orienteers, old and new,
made it to the G L C Champs at
Hainault Forest last Sunday.
Although having navigated safely
to the area (and later finding the
optimum route to the Pub!)
c e r t a i n d i f f i c u l t i e s were
experienced in the Forest.
Eppington and Shoreman,
though producing competent
runs, failed to become G L C
Champions in their respective
age classes. Newcomers Ian
Searle was noted exploring the
parts of the Forest that other
orienteers didn't reach, and I was
nearly beaten to the first control
by a lady walking her dog!
Does any of this make sense?
Come along to the Friday lunch-
time meetings in the Union upper
lounge to find out more about
'the thought sport'.
RUGBY
IC 2nd XV 13- UCL 2nd XV 8
IC Seconds produced the best
performance of the season so far
to defeat U C L , last Wednesday.
Despite some early impressive
rucking by a particularly skillful
U C L pack it was IC that opened
the s c o r i n g w i t h a try
(UNCONVERTED) by winger,
D Kelly (Capt). The try arose as a
result of some quick handling by
W Chapman and C Cole which
allowed the intruding full back M
Hassle to make some impressive
running before finally passing to
the winger. However having
opened the scoring IC spent the
remainder of the first half and
early stages of the second half
successfully defending their goal-
line till the U C L winger scored a
fine try in the corner. This try
sparked off what must have been
the best handling move of the
game, the end result of which
. was a try for O Miles. U C L
immediately replied with an
unconverted try before the game
was finally sealed with a
successful penalty from the boot
of M Hassle. Fine performances
by all the freshers, especially J
Ager (Stand-off) and R Ladd
(Hooker) who put up a brave
performance despite playing out
•of position.
