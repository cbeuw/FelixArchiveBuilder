FAX at
your
fingertips
Imperial College now has its own
Teletext service, probably the
first of its kind at a British
University.
The system, I C F A X , was
devised by Peter Chase, a student
in the Computing Department. It
involves two B B C M i c r o -
computers run from the College
TV Studio, and it is broadcast to
monitors on level 2, Sherfield and
in Halls of Residence. One micro
displays information while the
other has its memory refreshed.
I C F A X carries information
about College and Union events
and it is hoped to include Sports
results soon.
Any information to be
included should reach Lynda
Davies, Public Relations Office.
Room 546A Sherfield by 4.00pm
on the previous day.
Terminal
solution
Imperial Software Technology
have collaborated with the
School of Oriental and African
Studies to devise a computer
p r o g r a m which produces
Chinese characters on a terminal
screen in response to a typed
alphabet.
The 'romanized' version of
Mandarin Chinese, Pingin, is
typed into the computer with an
ordinary 26-letter keyboard.
Characters from the computer's
7000-character set then appear
on the screen.

tenth anniversary. Lord Flowers

Minister for Higher Education
Mr Peter Brooke (also M P for the
College area) has emphasised the
need for co-operation between
European scientists. In a speech
to European Ministers in Paris
last month M r Brooke proposed
the formation of an academy of
European Scientists which could,
he said, provide a 'presttgous
self-regulating body which fulfils
the function of a national
academy of individual scientists,
on a European basis'.
