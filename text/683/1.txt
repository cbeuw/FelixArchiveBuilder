Warning issued to CCUs
M a s c o t r y M a d n e s s
IC Union Officers are attempting to prevent further
breaches of Mascotry Rules after incidents involving
C&GU and RCSU on Tuesday when fire extinguishers
were discharged and cars were reported to have been driven
dangerously.
In the first incident, on
Tuesday lunchtime, the Chelsea
College mascot 'Anchor' was
brought to the RCS U G M using a
V W van hired by R C S from
outside College. They were met
outside the Chemistry Building
by a group of RCS students
carrying fire extinguishers. A n
opposing group of Guildsmen
were also present, including one
on a motorbike and two drinking
from milk bottles, when the
Mascot was later driven away.
RCS students discharged a C 0 2
extinguisher as the motorbike
attempted to follow the van,
causing the bike to stall. The milk
bottles were subsequently
thrown in the direction of
rubbish skips, but it is not known
by which party.
A memorandum was delivered
by hand later that day to both
C C U Offices from I C U Deputy
President David Parry. After
pointing out the dangers of
removing fire extinguishers, of
C 0 2 gas, and of broken glass.He
told C C U heads 'Mascotry is
supposed to be a friendly sport
not an exercise for G B H . I insist
that the use of C 0 2 fire
e x t i n g u i s h e r s is s t o p p e d
immediately and bottles are not
to be used.
Later on Tuesday, between
7.15pm and 7.30pm, the R C S
maseot 'Theta' was brought to
the College in the same V W van
for the Maths Freshers Dinner.
RCS students stood at the main
College gates and two fire
extinguishers were seen near by,
a l t h o u g h they were not
discharged or used threateningly.
After the van had driven
through gates in the campus a
white Ford Escort car drove into
its path, and the gates were closed
behind the van. Both vehicles
slowed down and stopped.
Between 20 and 60 RCS students
pushed the Ford out of the path
of the van, which then continued
to the Sherfield Building. The
mascot Theta was taken into the
Maths Dinner in the Sherfield
Refectory.
After the dinner Theta was
loaded into the van and driven
away along Exhibition Road.
A green Morris Marina car,
which was parked outside the
P o l i s h H e a r t h C l u b o n
Exhibition Road, tried to give
chase, but was blocked by about
50 to 60 RCS and C & G students
in the road outside the main
College gates. The car reversed
and attempted to go down
Exhibition Road on the wrong
side. A n RCS student in this part
of the road ended up on the
bonnet of the car. The student
was not hurt; it is not clear if he
jumped onto the bonnet or if he
was hit by the car, which was then
either stationary or moving at
very slow speed.
The car reversed again, and
drove towards the group on the
other side of the road. The group
dispersed and the car drove off at
high speed, with a damaged wing
and wing mirror. M r Parry, who
was a guest at the dinner, asked
students in the road to disperse.
Mr Ian Josebury, City and
Guilds Union Vice President,
told F E L I X he hoped that
mascotry should be conducted
safely. He thought Tuesday's
events were not dangerous.
Mr Sean Davis, R C S U Vice
President, was unwilling to make
any statement.

G FINED.
Mascotry is one of the oldest traditions of the Constituent College
Unions. Each has its own violate mascot, that is to say one that is fair
game to steal; Theta, Spanner and Davy for RCS, C & G and R S M
respectively.
Teams from each C C U closely guard their own mascot, and
organise 'raids' to try to steal other people's.
The rules of mascotry are embodied in the 'Mascotry Agreement' of
October 1982, signed by all CCUs and I C U , and still in effect.
A total of Â£2100 was raised on Saturday as the CCUs tiddlywinked
down Oxford Street for charity. The event ended with a Hey Vivo round
the Duke of York's memorial and big beers in the Cockney Pride
afterwards.
