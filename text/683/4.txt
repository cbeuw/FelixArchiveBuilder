CFEUX:
Recipe d the w e e k
-
It's a mistake to think that dinner guests must be given three
courses. If you watch people ordering in restaurants you'll find
that most of them just order either a starter or a pudding to go
with their main course. If you've made elaborate first and main
courses then a piece of fruit or a sorbet is a good way to end a
meal.
To be honest though, I've never had the courage to follow my
own advice, so i try to make my puddings exotic enough to get
compliments but no trouble to make.
'Sinful Pudding' is the name for 4f I oz of double cream, 12floz
of plain yoghurt and 1 dessertspoon of brown sugar. It is
sordidly expensive, disgracefully fattening and shamefully
delicious.
Mix the cream and yoghurt gently in the serving bowl.
Sprinkle the sugar over the surface and refrigerate for at least 30
minutes. The yoghurt takes away the cloyingness of the cream,
and the sugar makes beautiful marble-like patterns as you
spoon it out.
Serves as few as your consciences will permit.

H e r e ' s y o u r c h a n c e to
celebrate the festive season in
t r u e s t y l e by w i n n i n g
p r e s e n t a t i o n b o t t l e s of
Glenmorangie Single High-
land Malt Whisky.
What is a 'single malt'
whisky? It is the original
S c o t c h W h i s k y — t h e u n -
blended product of a single
malt distillery, which has been
produced and allowed to
mature according to time
honoured practices.
The name Glenmorangie
derives from the Gaelic and
means 'the Glen of Tran-
q u i l i t y ' . T r a n q u i I ity — a
p a r t i c u l a r l y a p p r o p r i a t e
description for the mag-
n i f i c e n t l o c a t i o n a n d
atmosphere of the G l e n -
morangie Distillery, in which
the new Whisky is born and
rests for ten y e a r s of
maturation.
Glenmorangie has its own
private water source—the
Tarlogie Springs, which pass
through red sandstone set
deep in the distillery's own
forest and give unusually
hard, mineral-rich water. Only
the best Highland Ross-shire
barley is malted for Glen-
morangie and this is lightly
peated as it is d r i e d -
imparting a subtle smokiness
to the spirit and preserving
delicacy of flavour.
But it is the stills used to
refine the new spirit which are
probably the single most
important factor in shaping
G l e n m o r a n g i e ' s u n i q u e
character. Installed in 1880,
Glenmorangie's copper pot
stills, though small, are the
tallest in the Highlands—at
16ft 10.25ins, dwarfing the
squatter pot stills of other
d i s t i l l e r s . T h e s e G l e n -
morangie stills ensure that
only the purest vapours
ascend to the top of the neck
column.
After this, maturation is
affected in American oak

d e l i c a c y and
develop. This
reflected in the
colour.
