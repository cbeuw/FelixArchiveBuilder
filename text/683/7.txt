PUZZLESD
However much this looks like a crossword it is in fact a puzzle.
A £5 cheque to the person with the most correct solution next
fortnight.
G R A D E FOUR
To solve last fortnight's puzzle put 65 volts across the circuit.
Then each resistor in the network represents a square in the
rectangle.
The height and width of the squares are the voltage and
current respectively through/across the resistors. We must of
course set all resistor values to one ohm to ensure that each
square is square. Using Kirchoff's laws we find the dimensions
of the squares to be 25, 24, 23, 22 19, 17,11, 6, 5, 3.
An alternative circuit is produced by turning the rectangle
through a right angle and reconstructing the network.
Congratulations to Neil Redman of Physics III who may
collect his £5 cheque after 1.30pm from the Felix office on
Monday.
My consolations go to Peter Ruffhead of computing who was
the only other person to solve the puzzle correctly. On the right
is the solution to the Crossword of Monday 1 October. The
winner is Simon Myers, Maths 2, who can collect his £5 on
Monday.
