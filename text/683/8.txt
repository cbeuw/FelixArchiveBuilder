CCLUBS
PHOTOSOC
Anyone out there?
Whatever happened to all the people who
signed our mailing list at Freshers Fair? We
had over 270 names, and yet only 50 people
have bothered to join so far. This is just not
good enough, so if there are any Felix
readers out there who would like to join, (it
costs £1.50 this year) they should come to
one of our regular committee meetings on
Friday lunchtimes in Southside Lounge, or to
any of the events mentioned below.
Next week we will be arranging some B &
W darkroom demonstrations. Anyone
wishing to attend one of these (you don't
need to be a member to do so) should sign
their name on the list on the photosoc
noticeboard (which is by the Gents Lavatory
at the bottom of the stairs in the union
building).
Also, we will be having a slide show on
Tuesday 23 October in Min Res Eng 303, at
6.00pm. This will include photographs by Lee
Mason and John Claridge. (Who?).
ANTI-APARTHEID
Career Decisions
October 31 sees the arrival of another
Careers Fair. The choice of a future career is
an important one, and difficult decisions
have to be made which balance many
factors.
On Thursday 25 October at 12.45 in
Huxley 139 Kate Clarke from the Anti-
Apartheid Movement will be speaking on: ' A
C a r e e r in S o u t h Africa? — The
Consequences'. Everyone is welcome to
come along, listen and join in the discussion
after her talk.
LIBERAL CLUB
By now, things have settled down at college,
grant cheques have been paid to many of
you, and no doubt you're all having a good
time. To hell with the G L C , nuclear
weapons, unemployment, the N H S , N U S ,
overseas students. IC is tending to its
apathetic norm. (Who's Norm anyway?)
over the past few years, a flourishing Liberal
Club has presented these issues to you. If
you want to participate in this years' Liberal
Club, come to the Brown Committee Room,
in the Union building at 8.30pm on Monday
22 October, for refreshments and chat.
SCC MEETING
Elections for Chairman and H S T of S C C will
be held at the full meeting this Monday (22),
Union Senior Common Room, starting
6.00pm; be prompt. All club senior student
representatives should attend, as otherwise
their grants will be frozen. Club finance,
S C C property and posts will be discussed.
Champagne cocktails at 5.55pm (subject to
availability).
AUDIOSOC
Discount Music
Audio Society will make you happy in two
ways, even if you're not interested in hi-fi.
First, you can buy records and cassettes at
discount prices through us, and then you can
discover how to enjoy the music from your
records even more.
The club has just bought a high quality
record playing system, so come along to the
Union Upper Lounge at 7.00pm every
Tuesday — and lunchtimes Tuesdays and
Thursdays — and hear our system or that of
a manufacturer of good hi-fi.
Order your discount records any Tuesday
or Thursday lunchtime in the Union Upper
Lounge. Whatever your taste in music,
Audiosoc is good for you!
BOOKSHOP
NEWS
One of the comments I continually hear
whilst sitting in my office concerns the price
of books. I would like to inform one and all
that the price of books is fixed by the
publishers. We, the bookshop, are not
allowed to up or lower the price, unless a
book is damaged, out of print, or a new
edition is being issued and the old has been in
stock for more than a year. Our stationery
items are usually lower than the
recommended retail price. If anyone has any
comments, please come and see me.
Even after more than three years, there
are still a small number of lecturers who
either do not give us a list of books they will
be recommending to their students or bring
me the list during the first two weeks of
Term. We do phone through daily to
overcome this problem, but unfortunately it
remains with us.
Your IC Diaries are in stock at £2.05.
General diaries 1985 will be out within the
next few days.
I apologise for the apparent chaos in the
shop. But over the years, the number of
books has increased while the size of the
shop has not. Hopefully we will get a bigger
and better shop. So spread the word. We
need it.
Pewter tankards and flasks are available
from the Bookshop at various prices.
Personal engraving is available at a cost of
0.20p per letter.
For the first month of Term, new titles will
be placed in the window, so watch for some
rather spectacular titles in the next few
weeks. Don't forget we don't only sell
academic titles. I will be doing a weekly
column listing the titles both Hardback and
Paperback.
SPORTSHOP By the time you read this,
we will have the new stock of sweatshirts, T-
shirts, tracksuits, Rugby shorts and shirts.
Don't forget if you require special printing on
any of our items, I can arrange minimum
order 25.
