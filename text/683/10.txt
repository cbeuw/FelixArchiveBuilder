Age of
Reason
'...accessory of the day: a copy
of Jean-Paul Sartre's 'Age of
Reason', worn in the back
pocket.'

David Bowie's next video.)
BOOKS TO BE SEEN: ART,
FASHION, AND CUNNING
The trick is, of course, to make
p e o p l e like y o u from a
distance. Displaying the right
attitudes is more important
than believing in them. The
smug corner of the bar may be
the den of spiky, black-
leather, trainee psychopaths,
but we know that people who
A R E 'living on the edge'
dribble, and wear top hats
made out of baked-beanstins.
The man who reads Germaine
Greer on his way to work may
indeed care about equality,
but there again, his motto
might be K N O W Y O U R
ENEMY. Sincerity went out
with student politics and blue
jeans, so get the martini,
practise your sneer, and
w e l c o m e to the A g e of
Reason...
Mathieu is a right bastard,
and therefore one of us.
Having made his mistress
pregnant, he has to think of a
(fairly) decent way of avoiding
his responsibilities. He is an
Existentialist, you see. If you
don't see read 'Existentialism
and H u m a n i s m , ' a l s o by
Sartre. G o o d word, isn't it? His
f r i e n d D a n i e l , a (fairly)
repressed homosexual, thinks
it would be really funny to get
Mathieu into a nasty marriage.
Meanwhile, Mathieu fancies
the eighteen-year-old sister of
one of his students (yes, he's a
lecturer. Didn't you guess?).
S h e , in t u r n , d e s p i s e s
Mathieu. except when he
sticks a knife into his hand just
to show how easy it is . All this
and World War two, too. 'The
Age of Reason' is the first part
of the 'Roads to Freedom'
trilogy. The time-span of the
entire book is just three days,
, giving plenty of scope for the
m a i n c h a r a c t e r s ' c a r e f u l
analysis of their own navels.
Vanity is cool. Theotherparts:
'The Reprieve' and 7ron in the
Soul' chart the coming of war
and the fall of France, using
the same crew of navel
specialists. Dallas bites the
dirt.
All of this hints at some
ground — rules for what can
be used as fashions and what
cannot. First not many people,
in publishing terms, should be
reading it at the moment.
E x c l u s i v i t y is t h e f i r s t
condition. It is important,
though, that enough will be
sold so that it will be available
in paperback. This means that
the book will be small enough
to carry around, and perhaps
fit in your pocket with the title
showing. Hardbacks are too
o s t e n t a t i o u s — u s u a l l y
bought by people who only
read a little and for the wrong
reasons — and don't get
battered so easily to show that
you have read the book more
than once. (Lit-lore: a good
book will only be fully
understood after the third
reading).
Some kind of philosophy
helps, as long as it is in the
background. Sartre cannot
resist putting in some really
obvious symbolic Act on
every third page. This means
that even if the story bores
you, the whole thiqg can be
treated as a kind if cross-
w o r d . A g a i n e x e r c i s e
discretion. We are now getting
into A-Level Eng Lit territory,
and the only way to approach
art is as a gifted amateur.
Never in order to please some
pompous fool who got a PhD
by quantifying. You know the
sort of thing: fifty points for a
sub-plot, ten for an allusion.
Naturally, there must be sex
in the book. The key word
here is 'natural'. If you force
the pace, then you've blown it.
Stand up Shirley Conran, and
take a bow. In 'Lace' (awful
book — I borrowed it from my
Aunt) she put the phrase 'he
was the Nijinsky of cun-
nilingus' in a serious context.
For this she ought to have her
head banged between two
typewriters. But then there are
other books which would
make you look even more of a
fool. READ, M E M O R I S E A N D
D E S T R O Y Alex Comfort's
'The Joy of Sex' and our very
own '...but were afraid to ask.'
On the shelf they are about as
cool as a provisional driving
licence. And anyway, didn't
your Mother ever tell you that
reading underthe bed-clothes
by torchlight will ruin your
eyes? Low-life is the key, and
the lower the better. Anything
by Henry Miller ought to fit the
bill. Also check out William
G o l d i n g — he's not so
obvious, but can get very, very
nasty when you think it over.
'The Spire' and 'Rites of
Passage' qualify with ease.
The Book Of The Film is
right out of all this. TV spin-
offs even more so. Shame
about 'Brideshead revisited,
but we must be firm, because
details count. T h e r e are
exceptions, though. Everyone
knows that the film 'Apoca-
lypse Now' was based on
Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of
Darkness', albeit brought
forward by about one hundred
years. But did you see the
books on Colonel Kurtz's
d i s k ? 'From Ritual to
Romance' by Jessie L Weston,
and 'The Golden Bough' by J
G Frazer (for it is they) are
both referred to by T S Eliot as
sources for his poem 'The
Waste Land'. And guess what
— the facsimile editions show
a quotation from Heart of
Darkness' as an epigraph. All
very tenuous I know, but you
must admit that it would
sound impressive, if only you
could keep the smirk off your
face. So all of these books are
safe to carry. Of course, as
with music, clothes, and
dangerous sports, it is best to
have seen it, done it, been
there, got bored with it just in
time for the thing to get
popular.
The uses of literacy: If you
hang around the Royal School
of Mines for long enough, you
will find someone trying to
loan you a copy of the very
arty and very controversial
'The White Hotel' by D M
Thomas. This can work in a
subtle way. Having lured his
victim into conversation (and
we A R E talking war, here) the
g e n t l e m a n in q u e s t i o n
casually asks what Victim
thinks of D M Thomas.
Victim: Dylan Thomas? Yes
he's good. Rage, rage against
the dying of the light. Moving.
John{w\th a forgiving smile):
Ah. No, not D M Thomas. Easy
mistake to make. I've just read
'The White Hotel' and I think
he is a genius, original...
witty...a major contribution to
road safety etc...
Victim: Really? I must read
some.
Well, you can work the rest
out. John presents Victim with
the book, complete with gee-
whizz jacket blurb by assorted
wunderkind and the man from
the T L S . Next time they meet,
Victim will find a straight —
faced John cooly discussing
experimental pornography,
touche. And what is more, she
can't use the standard reply
'sod off you dirty old man',
because she would then feel
likea philistime. John says his
success rate is better than
eight out of ten.
John is a right bastard, and
therefore one of us.
SINGLES
45 *P
Hall & Oates: Out of Touch
Anyone vaguely interested
in music cannot have failed to
notice the impact club/disco/
funk/soul discs are having on
the British Charts. Seems like
Daryl & John have just caught
on to this, and decided to cash
in. A s a soul record this is not
outstanding, as a Hall & Oates
record it is disappointing.
Give up on it fellas. G o back to
what you're good at.
J o h n n y S p e n c e r & T h e
Remnants Of The Once Proud
P a s t a f o n t B r e d B a r m y
Ensemble: The Strike Song
I don't believe this. I think
Ian M c G r e g o r must have
brought it out. Could put you
off supporting the Miners for
life. I'd rather listen to rice
crispies!
Meatloaf: Modern Girl
Trying to recreate the
brilliance of 'Bat out of Hell'
type classics, Meatloaf has
gone back to a Jim Stainman
style of production, although
not back to the man himself.
Despite shades of 'Paradise
By the Dashboard Light', this
is the bestthingforalongtime
from this colossus of rock.
Charlene: We're Both In Love
With You
Ever since 'Never been to
me', I've hated just about
everything from Charlene.
S h e is s o p r e t e n t i o u s l y
American and can make the
roughest song in the world
sound like a bowl of warm
golden syrup. On this one the
tune is great, the lyrics equally
as good. Charlene is ugh!
Kenny Rogers, Kim Carnes,
James Ingram: What About
Me
There seems to be atrend in
the U S to put lots of megastars
together, spend lots of money
on fancy production, and then
to release a trash single like
this. Surely, e x p e r i e n c e d
singers like these must know
how awful this is. Maybe they
don't care.
