Seven-tenths''of
top dons
and teachers
take THE TIMES
So only this: these particular Top People must
Keep themselves fully and widely informed.
They must be aware not only of happenings
in their particular field, but of discussion and
comment on questions of the day, internation-
al news, polities and the arts. For all this, they
turn to THE TIMES.
You may not want to be a top don or top
teacher: lots of people don't. But the same is
true of top civil servants, top businessmen,
top politicians. Whatever kind of top person
you hope to be, it's not too early to get in
training now by taking THE TIMES regularly.
Especially since, as a student, you're entitled
to it at half price: ask your newsagent or
write to THE TIMES Subscription Manager.

Our President this year is a
particularly capable individual.
Full of determination, he is also
very conscientious, hard-working
and ambitious but perhaps ?, little
too self-assured. In his two years
at I.C. Dave Watson has had very
little to do with the handling of
Union business (except as a mem-
ber of the RCC) and thus as an
observer he has been able to make
a critical study of the many as-
pects of Union management with-
out allowing himself to be drawn
into the petty politics of any social
clique. With this valuable experi-
ence and his own experiences of
university life at Cambridge,
combined with a first class brain,
Dave has great potential and
should be able to instill fresh ideas
into his approach to Union prob-
lems with a relatively unbiased
mind.
Twenty-three years old, Dave
Watson hails from Belfast. In
1958 Dave went up to St.Catha-
rine's College Cambridge to read
Mathematics and Physics. After
graduating with a double-first, he
came to I.C. to pursue research in
Theoretical Physics. Whilst at
Cambridge, Dave was an active
member of the Labour Club and
he also edited his College maga-
zine. Much of his spare time,
however, was spent with the John
Ray Society, of which he was both
Secretary and President in turn
which was concerned in studying
the impact of Science on Society.
Dave finds his relaxation in the
mountains. He has always been a
keen fall walker but only started
rock climbing during his last year
at Cambridge. At I.C. he quickly
became recognised in the Moun-
taineering Club as a very " hard "
climber, all this despite injuries
sustained in a road accident the
same year. The following year he
was elected its President and
during this period the standard of
climbing in the club reached a
new peak. The year culminated
in an expedition to the Stavning
Alps, East Greenland when 18
new peaks were scaled for the first
time. Constantly faced with
transport difficulties on club
meets, Dave was not prepared to
let matters lie. Through the initia-
tive of the Caving Club, he super-
vised the purchase of a 30 cwt.
Austin Van for the Mountaineer-
ing, Underwater and Caving
Clubs.
Dave first left his mark in Union
affairs during the initial NUS de-
bate and again during the final de-
bate when speaking out against
affiliation to.v NUS. His efforts
brought him into the running as a
candidate for President and his
success against better known op-
ponents came as a surprise to
many people, s
Dave is a great believer in the
rights of the individual and hates
unfair treatment of any kind. He
can be fully relied upon to safe-
guard the rights of the student
body as well. His term of office
is faced with many interesting
problems, especially now that pos-
session has been taken of the new
South Side facilities. I have no
doubt that Dave's determination
and persistence will be felt in
many circles throughout this year.
As President, his contribution to
I.C. will be undoubtedly of great
value. H.T.L.
WELCOME FRESHERS
from page I
bution to its development. Each
generation stands on the shoul-
ders of its predecessors, and you
must never feel that what was im-
possible yesterday is Necessarily
impossible today.
The opportunities provided by
develop wide interests—in sport,
music, current affairs, recreations
and socially (to name but a few)
—are yours only for the taking.
If you have not got the drive to
make use of them, then, however
successful you may be in acquir-
ing letters to put after your name,
you will be a failure in a more im-
portant context.
One last word—the College has
for a student to feel lost in it—
to feel he has no voice in its
affairs. In fact this is far from
being the case. The College has
a long and happy history of co-
operation between the " admini-
stration " and the Union, a rela-
tionship which is much valued by
the Union. In turn it requires the
student to bring his opinions,
suggestions, requests or com-
plaints to the notice of its officers.
This is more than a right which
possess—it is a responsibility.
The University Grants Commit-
tee has provided everything you
will need except the confidence to
use what is given to you. If you
have this, you will be assured of a
profitable and enjoyable stay at
I.C.

President, Imperial College Union
