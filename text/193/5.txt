IMPERIAL COLLEGE
EXPLORATION SOCIETY
ICES exists to bring together all those interested in the many
aspects of travel and exploration and to give whatever advice and
assistance it can to students planning expeditions. The annual pro-
gramme of' events includes discussions, side-shows, a Hop, and a
Dinner. Not only expedition members but also those with a general
interest in travel will find much of interest in the talks given about
various exotic parts of the world. The Society publishes its own
journal " Exploration Review," and a directory of personnel having
special knowledge of a particular country or technique is being pre-
pared. Full details of all meetings will be found on the noticeboard
outside the Concert Hall.
The Society should not be con-
fused with the Exploration Board,
which is a staff / studenet commit-
tee receiving financial aid from
the Union and the Governing
Body. The Board examines pro-
posals';; I past expeditions have
worked" in the Himalayas, the
Andes, the Azores, Iceland,
British Guiana, Iran, Ghana,
Arctic Norway, Malta, the Carib-
bean, Greece, Spitsbergen, Sicily,
Ethiopia, Nigeria, Jan Mayen,
Ceylon, Greenland, Sierra Leone,
the Balearic Islands, and Corn-
wall.
At Imperial College you have
perhaps an unrepeatable oppor-
tunity to organise and expedition.
It's hard work but it's worth it.

ular project, please ask for in-

N O N - S Q U A R E S
You don't have to be a square
to come square—dancing, espe-
cially at the Imperial College Folk
and Square Dancing Club, in fact
it helps if you're not one! How-
ever, squares on the hypotenuese
and ones with rounded corners
are catered for as the Club enjoys
a well balanced mixture of Amer-
ican, English and Scottish dances,
plus a few others thrown in for
good luck!
Last year we participated in
the University Folk Dance Festi-
val which was attended by some
700 students from all over Britajn
at the Seymour Hall. Of the 48
teams, our college had the largest
entry of three square sets. This
year we again hope to take part in
the festival which is to be held at
Sheffield University. The Carni-
val was no exception to our ac-
tivities; the lawn in the Union
Quad suffered somewhat from our
efforts, nevertheless an enjoyable
time was had by all. Our usual
meeting place, however, is not
damp grass, but the Union Snack
Bar, every Friday at 7.15 p.m.
New successfully accomplished
70 and this time we hope to in-
dances last year totalled to about
crease this figure to over 100 with
the aid of one of Britain's top
callers who will-be coming to a
number of our meetings. • So even
if you've never tried it before and
you feel you need, or should I
say deserve, a break at the end of
the week why not try folk danc-
ing and enjoy yourself.

R E C R E A T I O N A T I.C.
The clubs and societies at Im-
perial College are divided up into,
three groups, the " Social Clubs "
(political and religious), the
" Athletic Clubs " (competitive
sports) and the " Recreational
Clubs." The "Social Clubs"
will tell you that you have an ob-
ligation to support your religious
or political views—.they are after
your soul! The " Athletic
Clubs " will tell you that good
chaps join this club and that you
must train every week—they are
after your time ! The " Recrea-
tional Clubs " offer you the op-
portunity to do what you like,
when you like and as energeti-
cally as you like. For example,
you can go gliding or potholing,
climb mountains or play chess,
wear an aqualung or dancing
shoes and relax at billiards or
bridge. Many of these clubs
have a reputation that spreads
beyond the college, the Under-
water club has had several expe-
ditions working on underwater
geology and archeology, the
Mountaineering club this year
had an expedition to Greenland
and climbed so many new peaks
(well over 20) that nobody seems
to have sorted out the exact num-
ber. On a gliding club expedi-
tion to the Alps a member of I.C.
made the first ever glider cross-
ing of the Matterhorn (and back
in time for tea!) and on the
home front the productions of
the Dramatic Society and Musi-
cal Society always draw large
audiences.
These are some of the more
spectacular achievements of the
" Recreational Clubs" but the
real strength of the "Recrea-
tional Clubs " are those that exist
so that people with a common in-
terest can get together and have
facilities for their hopby whether
they want chess boards or photo-
graphic darkrooms.
You will find a list of the " Re-
creational Clubs " in your blue
Union handbook and a note in
the Union rack to the secretary
of any club that interests you will
bring you all the information
about joining that club.

THE II fi WELLS
SOCIETY
H . G . Wells, the Father of
Science Fiction, is one of EC's,
most distinguished alumni, and it
is fitting that a new society being
launched in the college this term
should bear his name. Wells
was a man of many parts—Fa-
bian, populariser of science, ra-
tionalist, advocate of World Gov-
ernment, utopographer, champion
of birth control, critic of racialism,
writer of Science Fiction—so the
society has a wide choice of topics
for meetings.
The society will have, broadly
speaking, three main aims. First,
to provide its members with the
opportunity to hear about inte-
resting work being undertaken in
fields of science and technology
other than their own. Secondly,
to consider the philosophical and
sociological implications of cer-
tain scientific developments.
Thirdly, to examine subjects
which are on the borderline be-
tween science fiction and science
fact, and to enjoy Science Fiction
" per se."
Several of the meetings arranged
for this term have a Science Fic-
tion flavour; indeed, even the
straightforward scientific subjects
seem to have romance back-
grounds. The talks on " Lasers "
(Oct. 14) and " Strange Ant Colo-
nies " (Nov. 4) bring to mind the
death-ray machines and predatory
insects of the more exptic scien-
tific romances, while the talks on
"The Mechanism of Brainwashing
and Conversion" (Oct. 21) and
" D N A and R N A " (Nov. 18)
look into the possibilities respec-
tively of " 1894 " and " Brave
New World." Even the talk on
" Operation Mohole " (Nov. 25)
might be taken as a description of
a " Journey to the Centre of the
Earth," and Mr. Cowan's talk on
Dec. 2, " The Stimulation of Liv-
ing Processes" should provide
plenty of food for thought and for
discussion.
In addition to these talks, there
is to be a Symposium on " Getting
Off the Moon " (Nov. 11) chaired
by Professor H . Elliot of our
Physics Dept. and led by experts
who are currently considering the
problem, and a showing of the
classic Science Fiction film " The
Shape of Things to Come " (Oct.
28), scripted by Wells.
The society's opening meeting,
on Oct. 7, will be about Wells
himself-his education at Imperial
College under Huxley and his
varied career; it will be addressed
by Professor G. E . G . Catlin,
philosopher and political scientist,
a leading left wing intellecetual,
who knew Wells personally, and
who was co-founder with him of
The Realist -Magazine." The
informal meetings over coffee
which will follow this talk and all
others should provide members
with a splendid opportunity to
discuss the subjects with the
speakers and with the teaching
staff of the college.
