At Turner & Newall we give a considerable
amount of thought to the question of a man's
future. And our graduate training scheme is
planned to be adaptable to his individual needs
-to employ and extend his attainment.; to the
full.
You May Know Our Name But . . . just to
remind you - we are not only the dominant
asbestos group in Britain, we also have a large
and growing stake in plastics, in insulation, in
mineral wool, and in glass fibre ... all adding
up to a £100,000,000 business with some
40,000 employees. Big enough to give a man
scope. Yet, because each of our nine British
companies largely runs its own affairs, not so
big that the essential 'human touch' is
endangered.
This balance is reflected in our executive
development training which, far from tyjng a
man down to any one type of career —
production, sales, administration - allows him
time to discover his true potential.
This way, we invariably find that the graduate
assumes managerial responsibility more con-
fidently - and certainly earlier - than is usua(
in a modern industrial complex.

SO Y O U W A N T TO JOIN
T H E D R A M A T I C SOCIETY?
So you don't want to join the
Dramatic Society. Well the choice
is up to you, but we did produce
five plays last year, and we even
staged an opera. Then there was
the Revue that we did at the end
of the Summer Term. I think it
was called " Three" because it
comprised of a revue, a play, and
a musical. That makes it nine
productions of various sizes.
Doesn't that mean that there's
a chance for Freshers?
Well I suppose so. One of the
plays for the London University
Drama Festival iwas almost 100
per cent. Fresher content. There
were quite a few Freshers in the
Christmas play " Ring around the
Moon." There were two Freshers
in the Revue, only they weren't
Freshers, because they had had so
much experience in the other
that they had been in during the
year. They enjoyed themselves.
You meet people.
But I can't act!
Nor can many of our members.
We call them stage crew. They're
experts, though. There's a lot of
valuable equipment back-stage. It
takes experience to drive it pro-
perly, but many have this experi-
ence. The scenery doesn't fall
down, either. It's well built. Very
well built. We have a workshop
by the stage, set aside exclusively
for the use of Dram. Soc. by the
Union. We are the sole purveyors
of high quality theatrical equip-
ment and appliances to the Union
functions.
Didn't you go to Hamburg last
summer?
Yes, we did " The Lady's not
for burning." The Germans loved
it. We had to print more tickets
—in German even. They ap-
plauded for six solid minutes at
the last performance. We tried to
stop them . . . but. . . The staging
was a creative challenge.
We lost some of our members
ras B.Sc. (Eng.) and B.Sc. They
were experts at Stage-craft. We
shall have some who hope to be
B.Sc. (Eng.) next year. We need
some new experts. It takes 7
weeks to learn the operation of
the Sound equipment—properly
It takes a long time to learn the
workings of the lighting gear—
properly. The stage offers many
challenges for creative design.
I expect someone will tell you
about the Fresher Reception we
hold later. You get a bit of food
and some tea, I think. You get
a tour of the stage as well. It's
rather interesting. You can come
along if you want, it's free.
Or come up on the Stage on
Freshers Day and see for yourself
—and talk with us. That's free as
well. Free of obligation. We like
to meet people.
Oh, I forgot; you don't want to
join the Dramatic Society.
