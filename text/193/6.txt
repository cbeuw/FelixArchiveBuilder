SOCIAL CLUBS
at
IMPERIAL COLLEGE
If your interests are. political,
philosophical, religious or natio-
nal, or if you like debating, then
you will probably want to join
one or more of Imperial College's
Social Clubs during your stay
here. \ Reflecting every strongly-
held opinion, left and right, home
and abroad, theist and atheist,
I.C.'s broad spectrum of Social
Clubs offers in the student world a
taste of society at large, a chance
to come to grips with the real
world before you get there. Uni-
versity life provides you with a
unique opportunity to learn, to
learn not only about your chosen
field of study but about other
people and other people's beliefs.
Science and technology will de-
mand,,, much of your attention
while you are here, but a little
time spent in trying to understand
points of view other than your
own will betime well spent: Col-
leges like ours, specializing in
science and engineering, can very
easily be accused of breeding one-
culture men, scientific barbarians;
we like to think that our well-
organized and actively-supported
Social,Clubs help to give the lie
There are five political societies
to such accusations.
—Socialist, Conservative, Liberal,
Communist arid C.N.D.—and if
you think you are a bit too right-
wing for any of these there is the
Flat Earth Society for ultra- con-
servatives. I.C. political societies
have a reputation for getting big
names in the political world to
address their meetings. Last year
Harold Wilson, Peter Thornycroft
Selwyrt Lloyd, Eric Lubbock;
this year, who knows, we might
see better (Lord Denning?). Links
with the University of London
societies are strong, and many
I.C. men help to run the U.L.U-
organizations. Delegates also at-
tend national student conferences.
Philosophical and religious so-
cieties are numerous. The Hux-
ley Society, named after the fam-
ous T. H . Huxley, once Dean of
R.C.S., represents the scientific
humanist and rationalist view-
point. Christians of almost every
denomination are catered for by
five societies: Church, Catholic,
Christian Union, Methodist and
S.C.M. Most of these hold regu-
lar devotional and prayer meet-
ings, apart from the more contro-
versial meetings. Students of
Jewish belief can join the Jewish
Society, and we also have a
Theosophical Society and an Is-
lamic Society.
Overseas students will want to
watch out for the International
Relations Club, which has a pro-
gramme geared to their needs and
interests and which has been very
active in recent years. There are
also a number of purely national
societies, the Arab, Pakistan,
Chinese, Indian and Africa So-
cieties which make special efforts
to make their members feel at
home, and collaborate with the
I.R.C. and its activities.
Finally there is the Debating
Society, which draws its support
from both inside and outside the
Social Clubs and is perhaps the
most important society in the col-
lege. Debates are organised be-
tween Imperial College and other
Colleges m the University of
London. M.Ps. and other public
figures are often invited as guest
speakers in particular debates, but
there is plenty of opportunity for
neophytes, beginners classes being
developed into such a labaryn-
thine giant that it is quite possible
organized especially for the pur-
pose.
The Social Clubs publish a ma-
gazine, SCRUTINY, which ap-
pears once a term and which
affords an opportunity to air your
views on religion, politics and the
rest. Watch out for it.
How does one join the club of
your choice? The most conveni-
ent time is on Freshers' Day, when
nearly all the clubs in the college
hold stalls in the Union proclaim-
ing themselves and their activities,
and when they will be only too
happy to enrol you. Alterna-
tively you can turn up to your
club's Freshers' Reception, or you
can write to the.Hon. Secretary
of your club care of the letter
rack in the lower Union lounge.
A full list of Social Clubs with
their aims and objects appears in
the Blue Book.

The Liberal Society at Imperial
College offers to all students an
opportunity for radical and pro-
gressive thought and discussion.
For the coming term, and for the
rest of the year, we are having a
comprehensive programme of
talks and discussions, with oppor-
tunities for meeting and talking
to leading Liberal personalities
and M.Ps. We are affiliated to
and are taking an active part in
the University of London Liberal
Federation where you will be able
to meet other Liberals and Radi-
cals. There is also an opportunity
for all members to take part in
the affairs of the Union of Liberal
Students and attending its annual
conference.
During the year, there are sev-
eral lighter forms of political
activity including a theatre outing,
with a dinner in the House of
I . C . W . A ,
You may or may not have
noticed that there are not very
many women students at Imperial
College. Last year we numbered
about 125 which is very few when
scattered throughout all the vari-
ous departments of the three con-
stituent colleges. I.C.W.A. exists
so that the women may meet from
time to time, and so that their
opinions on any matter may be
expressed, and not lost in the
mass of male points of view.
All women students are auto-
matically members of I.C.W.A.
We have one male member elec-
ted by us each year, and he is
known as Mr. I.C.W.A.
There is a lounge in the Union
building which is solely for the
use of Icwarians, and it is here
that we hold our general meetings.
We shall try to arrange some talks
this year on subjects of particular
interest to women, and any sug-
gestion on subject matter will be
most welcome. Last year we had
two such talks, one on hairdres-
sing and one on cosmetics. At
Christmas time we have an old
folks party for elderly people in
the district. In the Easter term
we run a Hop and hold our annual
formal Dinner and Dance.
Our Sports 'Club, I.C.W.S.C.
runs teams for hockey, netball,
squash, table-tennis, tenis, swim-
ming and athletics. The standards
vary considerably and anyone at
all keen here will be most wel-
come to join in. Last year twelve
memebers of the Club went to
Holland for a one week's sports
tour, which was great fun.
I.C.W.A. has its own notice
board beside the I.C.WiA. lounge,
and all notices of meetings, sports
teams, etc. appear on this board.
We hope to see all the Freshers
at the reception, and that you will
join in the activities of the associ-
ation, which can. thrive only by
your interest. It was a good year
last year and we hope this year
will be even better.
I.C.W.A. President.

Commons, and a free Wine and
Cheese party with U L L r . As
there will be a General Election in
the coming year, plans will be
made for interested members of
the Society to help with the cam-
paign to send more Liberals to
Westminster.
Our first rneeting is the Fresh-
ers' Tea, where you will be able to
meet other members of the Society
at an informal get-together. It
will be held in the snack bar on
Thursday October 3rd, starting
at 5.30 p.m., If you, have not
already met us at the Freshers'
Reception, come along to the
Freshers' Tea. A l l are welcome.
Anybody who might like to con-
tact us, please contact our Secre-
tary, Steward Aaron, or the Presi-
dent, Edward Fortune, via the
letter rack in the Union main
lounge.

On coming up to Imperial Col-
lege you will of course be at-
tracted by many of the Clubs and
Societies, which provide you with
an opportunity to take part in
your favourite sport or interest.
In addition to these Clubs and
Societies, you will also find here
the existence of the Church.
Perhaps at home you belonged
to your local Parish Church.
You might have been a member
of the Parish Youth Club or
Scout Troop, or served at Church
worship .or sung in the choir.
You may also have risen to the
exalted rank of being a Sidesman
or a member of your Parochial
Church Council! However
strong or however weak your link
with your Parish may have been,
we have pleasure in welcoming
you to join the life of the Church
in the student community of 'this
college.
If you are in a Hall of Resi-
dence, we trust you will be
visited within the next couple of
weeks by one of the members of
the Church Community — prob-
ably one who lives on the same
floor as you do. He will hand to
you a programme of the activi-
ties of the Church, and we hope
he will also have a chance to say
a word or two to you as to when
and where these various activities
take place.
We are not merely a " Sunday
Only " Church Community—we
try to live out the Faith every
day of the week, On Sundays
we use a church called St. Au-
gustine's, down Queen's Gate, for
a sung Eucharist (Holy Com-
munion) at 9.0 a.m. Here you
will have the opportunity of wor-
shipping together around the
Altar, and after that at 10 a.m.
of breakfasting together.
On Sunday evenings there will
be Evensong at St. Augustine's at
7.30 p.m., where some of the best
preachers can be heard. Again,
after Evensong, there will be an
opportunity during tea and bis-
cuits of meeting men and women
who not only belong to our col-
lege, but also come from others
such as Queen Elizabeth College,
Royal College of Music, Royal
College of Art, College of Estate
Management, Chealsea College
of Science and Battersea College
of Technology. It has always
been agreed that this Community
is a vigorous, active and caring
one.
Our weekly activities will be
found on page three of your pro-
gramme. You will find members
of the Church in every year and
every department of the college.
Your Chaplain is the Revd. Ivor
Smith-Cameron, who is an In-
dian (not a Red Indian !), and
your student leaders are Michael
Sammes (Chem. P.G.) and John
Moore (Mech. Engl. II).
