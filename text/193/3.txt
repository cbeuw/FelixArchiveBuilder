The Motor Club caters for the
motoring interests of the Guilds-
man, and indeed a cordial invita-
tion is extended to all I.C. people.
The pride of the Club, or rather
the pride of the College, is a
treasured veteran car—a 1902
James and Brown nicknamed
" Boanerges," or Bo for short. He
(one must emphasise his sex)
takes part in the annual run to
Brighton, usually getting there.
Last year's run was really a classic
in the art of running repairs when
one of Bo's bearings seized at
Streatham: the offending part
was rushed back to College and
repaired in time for Bo to reach
Brighton and qualify for a medal
and pennant.
The Club holds fortnightly
meetings at which there are film
shows or guest speakers from the
Motor industry. Last years
speakers included Raymond Bax-
ter and Sydney Allard. We also
make one or more visits to Car
Factories etc. during the year.
The first meeting of the Club is
on Friday, October 11th at 5.15
p.m. in room 542 of the Mech.
Eng. Dept. in City, and Guilds
College. The programme will in-
clude a film on the development
of formula Junior engines from
the Ford 105E engine,
As freshers of Imperial Col-
lege you have taken the oppor-
tunity to benefit from an excel-
lent scientific training but, if you
do not already know, you will
soon realise that there is a lot
more to University life than lec-
tures and labs. There is oppor-
tunity to meet people ; to estab-
lish new acquaintances ; to make
new friends. There is oppor-
tunity through joining college
societies to pursue your own
special likes and interests. Speci-
fically, there is now on Freshers'
Day or soon after opportunity
to join the I.C. Huxley Society.
This is the Humanist Society of
the college and—as such—it pro-
vides everyone who joins with
opportunities to hear well-known
lecturers, authors, radio and tele-
vision speakers, and philosophers
talk on subjects concerned with
morality, religion and philo-
sophy. While enjoying coffee
after these meetings opportunity
is provided for discussion with
these great speakers. In less for-
mal discussion meetings there is
opportunity to voice your
opinion among fellow students of
similar outlook—.and, when we
meet with other college societies,
among students with far differing
ideas and thoughts. Further,
through the Huxley Society there
are opportunities to attend con-
ferences organised by larger
Humanist organisations and, in-
cidently, the Monthly News and
Notes published by the Ethical
Union is provided free to mem-
bers. There are plans this year
to invite students from other col-
leges to our meetings in the hope
of establishing a link with other
Humanist Societies. (Psst!
" Other" colleges have more
than a handful of the opposite
sex—-i.e., females, and the "link"
is, we hope, a social one). A l l
this and more is there for the
price of 1/6 per session. Take
this opportunity now—he " i n
it" from the start. Join on
Freshers' Day or at the Huxley
Society's Freshers' Tea (Fri., 4th
October, 5.30, upper Refectory)
or by application stating name
and department to the Secretary
of the Huxley Society, c/o The
Union Rack. The opportunity is
there—we can do no more,
AN
OPEN
INVITATION
The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in Y O U — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
