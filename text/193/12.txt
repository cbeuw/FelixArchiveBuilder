Money matters are much less troublesome now. Now that I bank with the
Westminster. When I receive a cheque or a warrant, I don't hunt' round any
more for someone to cash it: I pay it Straight into my bank. I use cheques myself, for payments;
and bankers' orders—not my memory—take care of the
regular items, such as subscriptions. I gave myself full marks for 'discovering'
the Westminster. And so, I think, would you. Just ask the nearest
branch (address in Telephone Directory) to tell
you about the Westminster Bank service to students.
