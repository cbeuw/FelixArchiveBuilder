CROSS-COUNTRY
T H E B E N NEVIS R A C E
This year's race, held on Satur-
day 7th Sept. was as stiff a test of
stamina as any in the history of
the event. IC's contribution to the
total entry of 227 runners was a
four man team; C. E. James, P.
D. Crews, D. M . Reaves and I.
K. Pereira. Ex-IC man C. P.
Woodcock was also in the party,
but an injured ankle prevented
him from taking a full part in the
race. Nigel King, and old Cen-
tralian, also went along and acted
as a supporter.
The course, one of the toughest
in Europe, is 14 miles lor/; and
extends from Ford William at sea
level to the top of the 4,406 ft.
peak, and back again. Steady rain
on the day of the race made the
rock-strewn mountain path both
muddy and treacherous.
A pipe band led the competi-
tors to the start where there was a
surprisingly large crowd to cheer
them on their way. To begin with
the IC team held well back, being
aware of the long climb ahead.
By half way, Crews lay 46th with
James close behind and climbing
steadily. Both Reaves and Pereira
were further down the field. Con-
ditions at the summit could only
be described as arctic. It was here
that several exhausted runners
succumbed to the elements and
later had to be treated for expo-
sure.
Coming downhill was more
than just half the race. Crews
lacked confidence in descending
the screes and so slowed down.
When the runners fell back onto
the final stretch of road James
had caught right up, thereby
showing superior technique and
fitness. Meanwhile Reaves and
Pereira managed to held their
own.-
- At the finish, James and Crews
crossed the line 55th and 56th,
both with the time of 2: 6: 11. It
-was Reaves' first attempt at the
race, and a commendable one at
that (113th, 2: 24: 35). No doubt
the future will hold some im-
provement for him. Although
unfit, Pereira (122nd, 2:28:1)
returned a time which was only
slightly down on last year's per-
formance. Woodcock had to
nurse his ankle, but despite this
finished in 2:48:1 and showed
what taking a little care could do.
The overall winner was P. Hall
of Barrow A.C. in a record 1: 41:
45, and the team prize went to the
1 /6 Q.E.O. Gurkha Rifles. U L
runner P. Littlewood was 15th in
a good time of 1: 56: 7.

THE CLUB
I.C.C.C.C. is a club with a
shining past and a future that de-
pends largely on you. The de-
parture of our top dozen or more
runners over the last two years
means that we are looking for
talent of every standard for the
coming season.
If you ran, cross-country at
school, then why not now ? For
our size we must be one of the
busiest clubs in the Union. We
race twice a week and on many
days there is even a choice of fix-
ture. Apart from matches in
and around London there are
trips to Exeter, Southampton,
Leeds, Brighton and also an Eas-
ter tour of probably Ireland.
Whether you ran at school and
are toying with the idea of keep-
ing up, or are a confirmed addict
to the sport, come and see us in
the Concert Hall on Freshers'
Day. Come then, or turn up for
a freshers' run (nay trot) on
Wednesday, 2nd October. This
is purely a social occasion. We
will meet at 2.30 p.m. inside the
gym and then tea will be pro-
vided afterwards: For any fur-
ther information see the club
notice board at the foot of the
staircase outside the bar.
BADMINTON CLUB
The Badminton Club welcomes-
all Freshmen and invites all those
with any interest in the game at
whatever level to join the club.
The club plays three men's teams,
a mixed and a ladies' team. The
1st and 2nd men's teams; play in
U.L.U. League one and last year
the 1st team topped this League.
The men's 3rd team, a new de-
parture, will play in the U.L.U.
League Two and will provide
match play for the less experi-
enced members of the club.
Mixed social matches are arranged
and the club plays a number of
friendly matches, notably against
Oxford and Cambridge 2nd
teams. During the year there is
a 'singles championship for the
members and once a year we see
each other in trousers or dresses
for the first time at the club din-
ner and theatre visit. Like many
I.C. sports clubs the principal
battlefields are somewhat removed
from South Kensington, although
we have limited facilities in the
Union Building. Travelling in-
structions and details of trials will
be available on Fresher's Day and
will appear on the club notice
board.
SQUASH
A Y E A R T O R E M E M B E R
The Squash Club had a me-
morable year, four cups, an
almost unbeaten record, a tour of
Ireland and burnt out courts. This
year promises to be a difficult one;
at the time of writing (August) no
courts have yet been found, but
our fixture list is more impressive
than ever, and a professional will
continue to give instruction. Our
No. 1 remains Sherrif Affifi, an
Egyptian International, unless the
second team have been practising
over the Vac. We run two teams
with a variety of home and away
fixtures, and we are rarely affec-
ted by the weather.
The Squash Club will have a
stand on Freshers day, and the
whereabouts of this seasons
courts and trials may be obtained
there; pay us a visit.
J.M.C.
IMPERIAL COLLEGE
RUGBY FOOTBALL CLUB
The I.C.R.F-C. is one of the largest clubs in the College running
9 XV's every Saturday. The 1st X V plays the second teams of most
big London clubs such as Wasps, Richmond, Esher, etc., and the
standard gradually falls to the B 5's who play against anyone's Ex B.
All freshers will therefore find a standard to suit them.
Trials are being held at Har-
lington on Wednesday and Satur-
day next and free coaches are
provided from the Union and it is
hoped to see as many freshers
along as possible.
The club trains on' Monday
evenings in the gym 5.30—7.30
and Thursday 12.45; for tactics
and training in the park. Keen
members are invited out on Tues-
days also. Please note training
is compulsory for intending mem-
bers of the 1st and 2nd XV's and
others are very welcome to come
along.
The University knockout cup,
has been won by Imperial Col-
lege 9 times in the past 12 years
but unfortunately we are no
longer holders, failing miserably
to retain the trophy last year. So
a great effort is required from
every member in every team to
ensure a good fit healthy club and
to bring back the cup this season.
I do hope I can count on the co-
operation of every member of the
club in this mission.

I.C. ROVER CREW
VISIT ICELAND
Twelve members of the Rover
Crew joined the l.C. Expedition
to Greenland aboard the m.s.
Gullross at Leith on June 24th,
and sailed for Iceland. During
the first meal on board, the
Rovers, ably assisted by the
members of the expeditions pre-
sent, succeeded in devouring vir-
tually all of the cold buffet pro-
vided, much to the amazement
horror and disgust of the
stewards' However, during the
rougher periods of the voyage,
food was not so popular. . One
unfortunate member of the
Crew discovered (the uncom-
fortable way) that an evening in
the bar was not a good thing
before a rough night.
Iceland was eventually reached
after two and half days and
many pukings. The party stag-
gared ashore at Reykjavik, only
to be overcome by a strange
attack of " land sickness." (You
just can't win !) A representa-
tive of the Icelandic Scouts was
on the quay to meet us and took
us to to their H.Q. where we
spent the night after a day's
sight-seeing in the town. The
next day we were taken on a bus
trip by Dick Phillips- Iceland's
renowned walking tours leader-
past the mighty Gullgoss water-
fall to the hot springs of Huerer-
vellis in the central desert, return-
ing at 5.0 a.m. next morning to
Selfoss. Some of fthe party left
in the afternoon on an expedition
to Mt. Hakla, while the remain-
der stayed to see the milk pro-
cessing factory, entertain the
local children and explore the
country round about, before de-
parting on the Monday for
Loridmaunalauyer—not far from
the area visited in 1960 by an
I.C, Expedition. En route the
Hekla conquerors (and " con-
querees") were picked up, and
after much pushing of the bus
through the soft volcanic dust,
the destination was eventually
reached in early evening.
A week was spent amongst the
hot springs, strange colours and
lunar-type scenery, most people
making'the 50 mile round trip to
Eldgja—the world's largest vol-
canic fissure, with the truly mag-
nificent Ofaerufoss tumbling into
it. '•' " ..
The final part of the camp was
50-mile hike over the Torfajokall
pass to Fljotidal (near the Myr-
dalsjokal in the South). The set
of directions provided by Dick
Phillips proved invaluable in
helping us over the little used
route, and providing an alterna-
tive to map-reading.
Fljotidal was eventually
reached, the hike had provided
many magnificent views, debates
(especially on the method of
cooking luncheon meat) and
good laughs, as well as the usual
quota of blisters.
After returning to the Scout
H Q . in Reykjavik, most people
took advantage of the town's
swimming pool for a good-wash,
and then spent the remainder of
the time souvenir shopping.
The camp ended in the tradi-
tional way with a dinner of local
food, held this time at the Hotel
Vik, at which we entertained
Dick Phillips and Mr. Octogen of
the Icelandtic Scouts Associa-
tion.
The voyage home proved
rougher than the outward one,
and a fund was organised to be
given to the last person to be
sick, subject to certain conditions
about attendance at meals. This
was won by Vic Moss, who used
it, very public-spiritedly, and
bought drinks all round, whilst
sailing up the Firths of Forth on
July 15th,
