EDITORIAL
Felix has in the past frequently been called a newspaper^ with
no policy, at the best complacent, at the worst smug ; these charges
it has never denied, but has been countered with a defence of fair-
ness and unbiased reporting. Since I have been at college Felix has
always been a close refleflction of-~the "Editor; it has in turn been
witty, conservative, dull, brash and at one time it appeared that the
College had no other interest than Sport. This had been so because
the Staff involved with Felix has always been pitifully small—a sad
reflection on three thousand students here.
This year, by holding fortnightly staff meetings, and by keeping
the Press Room (at the top of the Union) open, Felix hopes to become
more than a one-man diary. For it td become a newspaper in the
strictest sense of the word much wider coverage is necessary; any-
one interested in journalism, photography, typing, or with a good
nose for a story, is more than welcome. The opportunities are end-
less. In fact, if you have the sort of mind which can sting the nerve
or wring indignation and action from complacency you could be our
star man.
From an integrated staff can arise a policy which will give Felix
the depth and strength it badly requires ; the time has come for
vigorous expansion, and since it is your paper, it is you who must
force this expansion.
N.B.—The next time you hear anyone say, " another bloody
awful Felix," send him to Room 73 Beit Hall. I will be pleased to
hear his views on improving it.

R.C.S. M O T O R C L U B
The main concern of the Motor
Club is the care and maintenance
of Jezebel, the R.C.S. Mascot,
which was presented to the Union
in 1955 by Messrs. Crossfield &
Son, of Warrington. She is a
1916 Dennis fire appliance, with
a % litre, 4 cylinder engine, which
" drinks " a gallon of petrol in
5 miles.
Maintenance consists of minor
mechanical repairs, re-painting,
polishing the Fifty-Six (56) square
feet of brass. Those who help
with this are entitled to travel on
Jez to various rallies, works visits,
and ceremonial occasions.
Any member Of R.C.S. is wel-
come to join, and anyone interes-
ted should get in touch with Mike
Vernon via the Union Rack.
