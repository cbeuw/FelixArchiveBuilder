IC G L I D E R PILOT FLIES TO M A T T E R H O R N .
GUILDSMEN
All Freshmen can start reading
here:—
If you aim to study mining,
metallurgy or pure science, then
you can stop reading here.
This article is for men only—
GuildsMEN. You have decided
to become an engineer. You
have been selected to carry on
the age-old tradition. Tradition
based on success. Success, that
is, at the expense of Mines and
R.C.S., the existence of which
you will no doubt realise in the
weeks to come.
For your information, R.C.S.
stands for R. C. Schroter, Guilds
Pres.
For your entertainment, R.C.S.
also stands for :—
(1) The National Anthem ;
(2) Royal College of Science ;
(3) The broom handle and ball
.cock.
The broom handle and ball
cock is called Theta, an anti-
quated phallic symbol R.C.S.
calls a mascot. They claim that
Theta resembles a thermometer.
Mine's mascot is not a pickaxe
or coal shovel as you might hope.
Actually they boast a Michelin
Man that they pinched from an
old Michelin lorry or something.
They also painted it black and
yellow. Presumably black be-
cause they are Miners and yel-
low because . . . well . . . yel-
low.
The Guilds mascot is the
famous SPANNER. Custom cast
from lead alloy] and painted a.
luxurious silver, and maroon, it
weighs nearly 701b., and is over
3 feet in length. The spanner is
held aloft by the President at the
end of every union meeting,
amidst the famous Guilds war-
cry " Boomalaka."
Early last year. Guilds as-
sembled a catalogue of college
mascots. Most impolite really
—R.C.S. and Mines weren't even
invited to the experiment. They
were so annoyed in fact that the
R.C.S. President volunteered to
do a song and dance in front of
several hundred Guildsmen.
Mines begged us to accept half
the return fare of their mascot—
from Bermuda.
As an act of-goodwill, Guilds
even set about decorating the
R.C.S. Physics building. The 30
ft. Spanner pasted to the outside
looked very nice indeed. The
scar remains to this day despite
pathetic attempts to scrape it off.
Guildsmen have also had fun
at the expense of other objects.
To name but a few, there is the
Albert Memorial, U.L.U., Bed-
ford College, Putney, Chelsea
Police Station, London Trans-
port and several private motor
cars.
Which brings us on to
Boanerges.
This renowned 1902 vintage
James and Browne motor car is
resplendent these days in a livery
of maroon and silver and free
from all tarnish. Bo takes part
regularly in the Brighton run al-
though now this is becoming
quite an effort. Recently Bo be-
came the father of twins, two go-
carts, who are beginning to give
him a bit of a run around. He
also pays an annual visit to the
Lord Mayor of London and at-
tends the May Ball and the En-
gineers' Dinner Dance.
The latter is the highlight of
the Guilds social calendar, and
the best formal occasion in the
college. A less formal, more
.riotous event is the Guilds Car-
nival, a whole night of wine,
women artd song guaranteed to
shorten your life by at least ten
years. So—-don't miss it.
The college boatrace takes
place anually on Morphy Day.
Two races are held and last year
Guilds kept place with tradition
by winning them both. Before-
hand, Guilds and R.C.S. do
battle on the muddy towpath.
Usually Guilds are triumphant,
leaving their victims half
drowned, trouserless and neck-
deep in mud. As with all sport-
ing events, such as the Swimming
Gala or Sports Day, the Union
Bar is the final target.
In the summer, we have the
Guilds Field Cup, held in Hyde
Park. This is a treasure hunt,
with the Serpentine and the local
Constabulary as the main ob-
stacles. No holds barred—no
Bar holds the winner.
As has been said before, suc-
cess is the cone of Guilds tradi-
tion and the secret is PARTICI-
PATION ! Anything goes well
if everybody takes part. This is
the essence of any successful en-
terprise.
And so Guildsmen, with
Freshers Dinners on us once
again, remember that whether or
not this is to be a year to be re-
membered depends on you.
Let no more be said . .'•".]

The I.C. Gliding Club expedi-
tion to Aosta, a gliding site in the
Italian Alps, was its most ambi-
tious ever. In guide book parlance,
Aosta is set in what must be
amongst the most magnificent
gliding surroundings in the world;
the glider pilot, reading between
the lines, would correctly infer
that Aosta is not for beginners,
and the party was chosen accord-
ingly.
At dawn on 17 July, Beit
Warden Frank Irving and crew of
3 set forth from Prince Consort
Road with our Skylark 4 on tow.
Meanwhile, Mike Neale (I.C.
President 1954-55) and crew of
3 were on the way to Dover from
Lasham with our Eagle 2-seater.
Eventually the Alps appeared on
the horizon, which Frank sur-
mounted via the 8,000 ft Grande
St. Bernard Pass with nothing
more than light passenger assist-
ance, Mike choosing the Petit St.
Bernard, allegedly for its superior
scenery. A shattering drive of
700 miles in 30 hours (only 17
hours actual driving) by Bill
Kronfeld and crew of 2 brought
the party up to 11, leaving 3 more
to arrive later by various means.
Aosta Valley is only -3 or 4
miles wide between the peaks on
either side, some rising 10,000 ft
above the valley floor. With in-
tense sunshine (very reliable!) the
valley soon resembles an oven,
and the hot air rushes up the
mountain sides in the form of
powerful thermals. All you had
to do, then, to get an unforgettable
view over the Alps was to circle
in one of these thermals and let it
carry you above the mountain
tops—or so we thought. In fact
it turned out to be more difficult
than this and the route to the
tops was often found rather close
to the mountainside, demanding
skillful flying in very turbulent air.
Moreover, the turbulence near the
! ground made the aero-tow launch
and the landing rather difficult,
so that a few of the less experi-
enced pilots did not fly solo, but
they nevertheless enjoyed some
extremely interesting flying in the
Eagle.
On one of the better days, Bill
Kronfeld climbed to 13,000 ft and
flew ,in the thermals from one
mountain to another and eventu-
ally reached the Matterhorn, 20
miles to the north-east, before
returning to Aosta. This flight
created a considerable stir in the
world press, for Bill was seen by
skiers from Breuil, a town at the
foot of the Matterhorn. Within
hours telephones were ringing
with excited reporters at the other
end, who contrived in their usual
way to get the story wrong.
It appears that this was the first
reported flight to the Matterhorn
from the Italian side in a glider.
Whepher this is the case or not,
Bill had fulfilled one of his ambi-
tions. Thirty years ago, his father,
Robert Kronfeld, pioneer of
thermal soaring, had made the
first ever glider flight to the Mat-
terhorn.
When not engaged ,in flying,
miscellaneous break-away parties
were sampling the night-life, etc.
Remote, high altitude night spots
seemed irresistible, mostly, one
suspects, on account of the hair-
raising drives up and down those
spectacular mountain roads. In
the heat, thirst quenching proved
to be a problem. The local water,
containing .20 per cent, alcohol,
had a very strange effect on some.
Cutting a long story short (the
rest will appear some time), we
did 140 hours of magnificent fly-
ing in 3 weeks, more than we
could hope to do jjn a whole
English summer. Four pilots who
needed a flight of over 5.hours
duration as one of the require-
ments for the Silver " C " certifi-
cate realised their ambition;
9,000 ft was exceeded on 13
flights.
