Last year I.C. teams
probably had the most suc-
cessful season ever, winning
all three U.L.U. Cup com-
petitions, with the 1st X I
runners-up in the premier
league and the 2nd X I win-
ning their league, I.C. main-
tained their very high Stand-
ard in the league competition.
This year too, things look
promising, with more than
one hundred freshers re-
questing trials on freshers'
day and a large majority of
already experienced I.C.
players returning to foster
the talents of the freshers.
With such a large number
of freshers, it has been very
difficult to assess the stand-
ards of individuals, but at
last teams are beginning to
take a reasonable form, and
we surely must be looking
forward to yet another suc-
cessful season.
At the end of last year,
three previous I.C. Football
Club captains left College to
take up work in industry.
With three players of this
standard all leaving at once,
the I.C. 1st X I has had to
undergo a little reconstruc-
tion and, as yet, the 1st X I
has not been a settled team.
Players who are at present
playing in the 1st X I have
to play well in an attempt
to secure their place and to
gain the confidence and re-
spect of their fellow team
members. This is also the
case in the other teams,
where juggling for positions
goes on at an equally intense
rate.
However, on the first
match day of a new season
I.C. teams have begun to
establish themselves already.
On Wednesday, the first of
three iteams went to St. Clem-
ent Danes, a school with a
very high standard of play-
ing ability, and we came
away victorious from all
three pitches.
The first eleven, with a
team including three fresh-
ers won by 2 goals to 1, the
goals both coming in the
first half from T. Tibbutt,
a fresher making his debut
for the 1st X I and from C
Willcock who hit the net
from the penality spot. How-
ever, with one win under
their belts the firsts have no
cause to be complacent; at
times their play lacked all
fluidity and but for the ex-
cellent work of N. Bakewell
in goal and M . Pearson —
another fresher—at centre
half—they might not have
been victorious over the
schoolboys.
On this performance,
though, the first X I seem set
for success this season pro-
vided that both the first and
second team members attend
training regularly. Training
is essential to build the team
spirit, understanding and fit-
ness which are imperative for
a successful team and indeed,
a successful club.
Also, at St. Clement Danes
the second X I won 2-1,
whilst the third X I domin-
ated their game and ran out
easy 5-0 victors.
Meanwhile at Harlington
I.C. teams entertained our
close rivals U.C., but as is
alaways the case I.C. came
out firm winners overall, the
fourth X I winning 5-0, the
fifths winning 4-2, and the
sevenths won their game, but
our only defeat of the day
came for the sixth team who
slumped to a 6-1 defeat.
Overall these results look
promising and the season is
now well on the way, how-
ever, in order that the club
should also promote some
social atmosphere we will be
holding our annual Pie and
Mash Supper next Wednes-
day, when we hope all club
members will come along so
that we can introduce the
freshers to a lively and
friendly club.
1st team: N . Bakewell, P.
Maslin, C. Acutt, C. Will-
cock (Capt.), M . Pearson, N .
Fryer, P. Willey, P. Bartlett,
B. Milne, B. Smith, T.
Tibbutt.
1st XV win opening match
IC lst X V began the season
in fine style against Avery
Hill College of Education on
Wednesday, 13th October,
when we notched up a score
of 66 points against weak
opposition. Although it was
a wet day which made the
ball greasy and difficult to
handle, IC always attempted
to move the ball with appro-
priate results. The scoring
was opened when A. D. Hav-
lin went over in the corner
for the first of his five tries,
A. James converting. An-
other 12 tries followed dur-
ing the course of the game,
even fly-half A. James man-
aging to get one. (His first
try ever for IC lst XV).
Scorers were:
Tries: Havlin (5), Hunt
(2), James (2), McDonough,
Michael, Pilkington, Hughes.
Conversions: James (7).
Team: J. Hughes, J. Mc-
Donough, P. Pilkington, A.
D. Havlin, J. Hunt, A. James
(Capt.), C. Flanagan, M .
Sugrue, H. Michael, C. Wrig-
ley, R. Mathews, C. Humph-
ries, G. Roberts, I. Partridge,
A. Tebbett.
Now that the trials are
over and most people are
gainingfitness,the club is be-
ginning to settle down to a
new and we hope, successful
season. The success of the
club depends largely on the
new influx of rugby talent,
since any college side loses
many stalwart members at
the end of a year. This year
again, about 60 freshers
joined up at the freshers fair
and with such an increase in
membership it should be pos-
sible to field 5 or 6 teams on
a Saturday afternoon.
Whether we do or not, de-
pends on you and the effort
and enthusiasm you are pre-
pared to put into the club.
So, turn up to training at
5.30 in the gym on Mondays,
and remember tick your
name off on the team lists
as soon as possible and in
any case before Friday. The
Fix. Sec. Mike Agg works
hard throughout the week to
obtain fixtures for Saturday
so please turn up, so that all
his hard work has not been
in vain.
Those of you who think
that you deserve a place in a
higher team, be patient, be-
cause those who are worthy
of that place will eventually
get recognised. The best ex-
ample of this are this year's
Captain and Vice Captain
who both began last season
in the A2 team and gradually
worked their way up.
Now, a word about the
club off the field; on Mon-
day, 25th October, the
Annual Pie n' Mash will be
held in the Lower Union Re-
fectory and as most of you
have paid already you may
as well turn up at 7.0 p.m.
As it is a Monday you can
work up a suitable thirst by
going to training before-
hand.
On November 5th at Har-
lington, ACC are holding a
disco which we hope will go
off with a bang!! There will
be a fireworks display and
a bonfire and since the Rug-
by Club are doing most of
the organising, we hope that
you will come and support
the venture. Coaches will
leave from the union, so keep
an eye on the notice boards
for further details.
During the course of the
year the club intends playing
a match against the Presid-
ent's (Prof. Sparkes) X V to
celebrate the 50th annivers-
ary of the club. The match
will be followed by a dinner
in the Union. Also there will
be a foreign tour during
Easter; probably to France.
As you see there's plenty
to do this year, so train hard,
play hard and enjoy your
rugby at IC both on and off
the field.
As some of you may or
may not remember the bad-
minton club had overwhelm-
ing success in the U.L.U.
league last season. Along
with retaining the Mens I
cup for the second year run-
ning, the Mixed I brought the
cup to IC for the first time
in the listing of the U.L.U.
league. Both these events, I
might add, were won out-
right, that is, not losing to a
single college for the past 2
seasons, a record which I am
certain will be equalled this
coming season. The Mens II,
III, and IV did extremely
well by coming 2nd, 2nd, 3rd
respectively. With the usual
problems of finding regular
players especially in the IV
team this was quite an
achievement.
Getting on to this season,
we have introduced a 2nd
Mixed team in the U.L.U.
league, hopefully with the in-
flux of keen, fit, girl freshers
we shall be able to go from
the 3rd division to the 2nd.
We have previously had a
shortage of girl players, but
I'm sure this season will see
a change in this.
With the relentless efforts
of the ACC in the guise of
Bill Beauford (ACC Chair-
man) the authorities have
given us the use of the Great
Hall, along with two Porta-
courts.
Wednesday afternoons and
Saturday mornings will be
taken up with league match-
es, but we have club play
from 1-5 o'clock in the after-
noon. Anyone, whether team
member or virtually no ex-
perience, male or female or
otherwise are invited to join.
Coaching will be given to be-
ginners so please come along.

Volleyball
The teams finished last
season's successful run by
being awarded the Links cup
for the most improved club
in Imperial College. We took
part in six main competi-
tions—five of these pro-
duced medals—three of
them first places.
There are murmurings in
the air that soon an IC wom-
en's Volleyball team will
emerge—we already have
two invitations to play
matches but as yet only ten-
tative offers from the 'fairer'
sex (to play volleyball as
well!). Any further enquiries
should be addressed to the
secretary via Internal mail.
Will all members (or
members-to-be) please con-
tact the secretary as soon as
possible. Practices are held
every Wednesday (2.30 p.m.),
Friday (5.30 p.m.) in the
union gym—a Sunday ses-
sion will be arranged if there
is sufficient demand.
Volleyballs to you all!!
R. Gryg (Secretary).
Another session is upon us and Freshers will have been
conned into paying subscriptions to various clubs. For those
who have not paid, it might be noted that sport at I.C. is
remarkably cheap compared with the cost to play in clubs
outside college.
The standard reached by I.C. sports clubs is very high with
the College having teams as good as many of the Universities.
In order to maintain these standards a great deal of work has
to be put in both on and off the field. Captaincy is important
on the field but in college part of the hardest work comes
outside competition and it is essential that initial enthusiasm
by captains and members be maintained throughout the year.
Not only does I.C. cater for the high quality sportsman
but there is every opportunity for the average player. You
are sure to find your level in one of the many teams run
by each club where you should extract maximum enjoyment
from the sport.
During the summer term the College is plagued by exams
and lack of Felix yet at this time the cricket and lawn tennis
clubs are functioning. Last year the tennis club had an
unfortunate time being upset by the weather and the postal
strike! but the captain, Pete Lonnen, has promised that the
club will be in existence and active this year. The cricket
club was enjoying perhaps its most successful season, win-
ning the ULU cup comfortably and a great deal of credit
must go to Russ Smith, the captain.
With winter upon us, most of the clubs will be aiming
to win their respective inter-collegiate U L U cups or leagues.
Last season the Rugby Club lst X V disappointed themselves
and the rest of the College by failing at die final hurdle to
retain the Gutterridge Cup. They set off this season, to
regain the trophy with a team weakened by the loss of key
players and freshers scarce — yet they still have enough
enthusiasm to pull it off. Meanwhile the Football club has
such a record of achievement that great things are expected
of them automatically.
Badminton, Volleyball and Swimming clubs had outstand-
ing success last session and can only look forward with plea-
sure to the forthcoming competitions. Badminton is now
played in the Great Hall which is not only convenient for
players but spectators as well.
The girls at I.C., with so few to choose from, always
seem to produce a Ladies hockey X I of very high quality
and this year seems to be no exception. They have already
won an early season tournament and we must look forward
to them regaining the U L U cup.
Generally, the feeling amongst the captains is that al-
though they have lost some experienced players, hard work
and continued support from the members will lead to the
usual array of trophies being set up for cleaning in the
Union.
This year there is to be a bonfire at Harlington when the
goal posts will be set alight on Friday, November 5th. There
will be coaches to the event, the cost of which will be in-
cluded in the entry ticket.
Ten Bowling
The Ten Pin Bowling Club is a relatively young club
compared to some of the other, more established Imperial
College clubs, however over the years a small nucleus of
keen members have managed to build this club into a lively
weekly gathering of both sexes. Meetings are held every
Wednesday at the Airport Bowl, near Heathrow, and a coach
leaves the Union Arch at 1.30.
The activities are not restricted to Wednesday bowling, as
every weekend three five-man and one women's team bowl in
the University Ten Pin Bowling League. Up to now we have
collected a few medals, but always seem to settle somewhere
near the bottom of the league table, probably due to the
grants running out at the end of term. This year free tuition
is available, and for this I should like to mention the
manager of the Bowl who has been very accommodating up
to present. The bowling rate has been reduced this year to
25p for a three-game series.
An internal league will soon be established so I would
advise anyone considering joining the club to come along at
the earliest opportunity, in order to take full advantage of
the tuition which will be available for the first few weeks.
Women are especially invited to attend as this sport is not
restricted to the male student population. Further informa-
tion can be obtained from the Secretary, Dave Griffen, Tizard
436.
