"Speaking."
"Well, I'm just ringing to
ask about a job like . . . I
got this degree and I
thought . . . "
"Yes, I'm sure we can
help, would Monday, 9.30,
do?"
Getting a holiday job
may be this easy, but finding
a career isn't. No one really
needs the Meacocks of this
world to tell final year stu-
dents they'll soon be out in
the cold. Many students are
likely to make the wrong de-
cision at first. In College,
imaginative projects like
Vacation Training fail to
give a true view of working
in industrial laboratories and
the like. Clearly when the
real thing arrives, the easy
Life at University for most
people is very enjoyable and
often exciting. There is
always something to do,
someone to talk to. But for
almost every student there
are times when they feel
really down, either due to
academic matters or some
private problem. At times
like this, you feel the need
to have a talk with some-
one, either just for the com-
pany or to discuss some par-
ticular problem. But is there
always someone there to go
and chat with? Most stu-
dents have a friend they get
on well with, but are they
always there at the particular
moment they are required?
Worse still, there are some
students who suddenly find
there is no one they can talk
frankly with or no one they
can turn to without feeling
they are imposing on them.
Now who else could a
lonely student turn to? Well,
until last April, he had four
courses open to him: —
(a) Go and talk with his
tutor or supervisor and ask
their advice.
(b) Go and see Dr. Grey in
the Health Centre at 14
Princes Gardens, who could
refer him if necessary to Dr.
Storey, the College psychia-
trist, who visits the Health
Centre twice a week.
(c) Go and see the Student
Counsellor, Mrs. Hartnett,
who is also available at the
Health Centre without ap-
pointment on Tuesdays,
Thursdays and Fridays.
(d) Go and impose him-
self on some other student,
hoping that he might be sym-
pathetic.
atmosphere vanishes and you
as an employee are faced
with a novel amount of re-
sponsibility. Lose the job
and you may have difficulty
finding another.
The easiest decision must
be to postpone the decision
itself. Well. . .
1. I.C. still approves of
further qualifications, even if
industry sometimes turns up
its nose. You can do some
M.Sc.'s on lower class de-
grees.
2. For the rest of us, the
possibilities are less, but no
less interesting. A job for
say a year in anywhere from
a bakery to a building site
may provide valuable ex-
perience, thinking time and
finance for consideration of
a job abroad. (Remember, as
an assisted immigrant in Aus-
NIGHTLINE
However these above al-
ternatives were only available
during the day and it is per-
haps in the evening and at
night, when a somewhat
lonely student is feeling at
his worst. Thus it was felt
that some services similar to
that provided by the Sama-
ritans could be offered by
students to other members of
the College.
And so Nightline was born.
A number of volunteers went
through a series of lectures
and had a field test. Now a
telephone is manned at
Nightline between the hours
of 6 p.m. and 9 a.m. Two
volunteers are on duty every
night and a third person
sleeps nearby to aid them in
an emergency. A flying squad
will shortly be available to
enable volunteers to go out
to students in need.
How do you contact Night-
line?
Should any student feel at
any time that he or she would
like to talk to sympathetic
fellow students, then he can
contact us through the in-
ternal telephone system No.:
2 4 6 8
or the external telephone sys-
tem No.:
5 8 1 - 2 4 6 8
or by coming to 8 Princes
Gardens, which is next door
to the swimming pool.
Any information given "to
one of our volunteers will be
treated in total confidence.
tralia, for example, a deci-
sion to move on before two
years will cost you the full
return fare).
3. If leaving the country
for a couple of years really
does appeal to you, then
VSO could provide the means
and also interesting work,
for example educational pro-
jects in under-developed
countries. If you really enjoy
the work then they may ask
you to continue.
4. Many liberal-minded
university students often find
satisfaction in teaching for a
few years. This requires a
one-year B.Ed, course and a
year in teaching to secure the
qualifications. The rest is up
to you.
5. Ignore your degree alto-
gether. Be a painter or a bus
conductor — remember de-
grees aren't really so few and
far between.
NEW VOLUNTEERS
With quite a lot of last
year's volunteers being in
their third year. Nightline now
requires some replacements
for them, as well as other
people, who are willing to
help in some way, so that
we can build up a really effi-
cient service to the commu-
nity. There are a number of
ways in which people can
help: —
(a) By entering the next
training programme, which
will be starting at the be-
ginning of November and
given with the help of the
London Samaritans.
(b) By being the third per-
son (untrained) on duty at
nights. This person on most
occasions will get a full
night's sleep, but in the event
of a crisis, it will be their job
to arrange transport if neces-
sary, to summons another
volunteer if one of those on
duty has to leave the centre,
etc.
It is hoped again to build
up a transport system of our
own for use in the event of
an emergency, without having
to rely on public transport.
(c) If you own a car and
live in hall you can be in-
cluded on a transport rota.
(d) If you can drive, but
don't have your own car, and
you live in hall then you can
still be included on this rota,
as we hope to have the use of
some of the college vehicles.
If you feel you would like
to help in some way either
call in at No. 8, Prince's Gar-
dens one evening or contact
the Director, I.C. Nightline,
c/o the I.C. Union Office.
Two years ago, a ques-
tionnaire was sent to all
undergraduates asking them
if they wanted the opportu-
nity of taking non-technical
studies as part of their de-
gree courses. Of the 50%
response, over 90% came out
with a firm YES.
Over the two intervening
years, this student demand
has been very much in evi-
dence. The Union has done a
lot of work persuading de-
partments to allow their stu-
dents the option of basing up
to say, 15% of their studies
on non-technical subjects
which carry credit in the
same way as their technical
counterparts. This allows a
student to take full advan-
tage of I.C.'s specialisation
(or to obtain a broader edu-
cation, as he wishes).
Some departments have
been operating such schemes,
in one form or another, for
a number of years, and now
the range of subjects covers
Sociology, Psychology, His-
tory of Science, Politics,
Twentieth Century History,
Modern Literature and
Drama, a Seminar on Pro-
gress, German and Russian.
However, there are still some
departments whose students
are not given the opportu-
nity to attend any of the
above courses, let alone gain
course-credits for doing so.
We hope that this year will
see the appointment of an
"Academic Director", who,
a
s a senior staff member, will
be responsible for co-ordinat-
ing the field of Associated
Studies on matters of policy,
helped by individual mem-
bers of staff housed in depart-
ments as at present. This
should encourage those
dubious departments to par-
ticipate in what should be-
come a college-wide system
of options.
There is another, even
more important, side to your
education here as scientists
and engineers; and that is
the relation that a particular
branch of science or techno-
logy has to other branches
and to society in general. The
importance of tying to-
gether the teaching of any
scientific discipline and its
past, present and potential
effects on society and the
world in general should be
openly realised, and discus-
sion on the subject should
become an integral part of
any undergratuate course in
this college. We may thereby
hope to produce thinking and
socially responsible people a
s
graduates.
Projects, which may have a
basis in a science or techno-
logy and proceed from there
to examine social, political
and economic implications,
are immensely valuable in
fostering this awareness; pro-
jects of this nature are under-
taken in some departments,
ft is true that a student may
get only as far as formulat-
ing the problems involved in
the area he is looking at and
supplying possible methods
of solving them, without
coming up with the defini-
tive answer—but he will have
learnt a great deal in doing
so. The staff concerned with
Associated Studies subjects
provide invaluable back-up
for this type of work, and
many staff are finding that
they can contribute more
than even they expected. An-
other advantage of project
work is that it does
not involve timetabled lec-
tures (i.e. does not disrupt
the timetable from the ad-
ministrative point of view),
and leaves much more to the
initiative of the individual
student.
Broad-based projects may
certainly prove to be the
major academic development
on a College-wide front
during the next few years at
Imperial.
