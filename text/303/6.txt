Canned Heat what's
Only three films to be re-
viewed in this issue. The first
of these is 'GIMME SHEL-
TER'. This is the Maysles
Brothers' film of the Rolling
Stones' tour of America in
1969 culminating in the free
concert at the Altamont
speedway. All the film leads
up to the Altamont concert,
where there was repeated vio-
lence in the crowd and a
Hell's Angel knifed a man
to death. This film has been
seen as an ironic sequel to
'Woodstock' but the film is
very different; 'Woodstock'
presented a view of the size
and grandeur of the event
and tried to produce a mes-
sage out of this ('the largest
gathering of people ever in
one place who didn't join in
battle') whereas 'Gimme
Shelter' concentrated on the
differing responses of the
people involved. There are
many other thoughts that
could be derived from this
film of the Altamont concert
but to make this review brief
Films
I recommend you to go and
see it, because this film is the
best example so far of the
fusion between cinema-
verite and rock music.
On the other hand 'MAD
DOGS AND ENGLISH-
MEN' is just a rock film, no
particular message just a film
of Jock Cocker's tour of Am-
erica with the 'Mad Dogs and
Englishmen', it is quite funny
and very enjoyable with
about twenty songs all done
in Joe Cocker's own very
original style.
If you have kept the last
edition of 'Felix' you will, see
that in there I reviewed 'The
Music Lovers' and in this edi-
tion I'll take a look at Ken
Russell's latest film 'THE
DEVILS'. The problem with
Ken Russell's films based up-
on historical fact is to decide
what is historical fact and
what is Ken Russell. He
seems to have followed the
book 'The Devils of Loudon'
by Aldous Huxley very close-
ly. It could be described as
a typical Ken Russell film;
all the erotic sequences are
there, he uses the claustro-
phobic sets that look so arti-
ficial and theatrical but
which are so beautiful. Yet
it does not stand comparison
with 'The Music Lovers'; it
is probably much more fac-
tual than 'The Music Lovers'
yet by not editing the film
tastefully, his film struck me
as being very sensational us-
ing a combination of gory
details and erotic sequences
to 'sell' the film. Out of the
cast Oliver Reed as Father
Grandier, the lecherous but
honourable priest, and Van-
essa Redgrave as the crippled
nun infatuated with Father
Grandier come out the best.
In the next issue I hope to
be reviewing Barney Platts-
Mills' second film 'Private
Road' and (possibly) 'And
Now For Something Com-
pletely Different'.
John Bryan
Terry Riley:
"A Rainbow in Curved Air"
Terry Riley is an Ameri-
can contemporary classical
composer with whom listen-
ers to avant-garde Jazz and
Rock are probably familiar.
His work "Keyboard Stud-
ies" was performed at the
Proms in 1970 on the same
evening as the performance
of Soft Machine, on whose
music he has considerable in-
fluence. "Rainbow" was re-
leased in the USA in 1969
though CBS have up till now
not released it over here.
Anyway, now that it has been
released, there should be no
excuse for anyone who has
not heard this remarkable al-
bum. The title track, which
Records
occupies the whole of the
first side, is a composition for
various keyboard instru-
ments; over a background of
pre-recorded loops appear al-
most frenetically played note
sequences in a sort of con-
versation. The overall effect
is one of continuous variety;
on the first listening you be-
come hypnotised by one note
sequence and the others are
relegated to the background,
while on the second listening
another sequence captures
your attention, and so on.
The second -side of the
album is taken up with "Pop-
py Nogood and the Phantom
Band", an even more mystic
piece of music than "Rain-
bow". It begins with a series
of loops compounded in a
collage, like Soft Machine's
"Out-Bloody-Rageous" (Sor-
ry, "Out-Bloody-Rageous" is
like it), followed by a long
section featuring Terry on
soprano sax, using repeating
loops again and echo devic-
es, described on the cover as
"Spatially Separated Mirror
Images". It's reminiscent of
"Hall of Mirrors", another
of Terry's works which I
hope everyone's heard. Both
pieces evoke a very strange
atmosphere, and to those
who think "The New Music"
ended with boring, deafening,
free-form improvisation I can
only say put this on the play-
er and close your eyes.
The first time I saw Can-
ned Heat was a bright sunny
morning on a Festival field
in Somerset. They had a sing-
er so fat he nearly stomped
his way through the stage,
one guitarist with a voice like
an owl and another who stay-
ed rooted to the spot for the
whole act—they were a sen-
sation. Changes have come
since then: A l "Blind Owl"
Wilson is dead and Bob Hite
has lost a lot of weight, but
on Monday night Heat show-
ed they're still capable of
playing the meanest rocka-
boogie ever to shake the
foundations of the Albert
Hall.
They were preceded by
Stone the Crows, who receiv-
ed a well-deserved ovation
for their polished act. A solid
rhythm section of Colin Allen
and Steve Thompson (re-
member them with John
Mayall?) backs up the very
skilful Les Harvey on guitar
land of course singer Maggie
Bell. She has all the earthy
appeal of Janis Joplin or
Tina Turner and a voice to
match either. If any group
can put everything into their
music and still give an im-
pression of superb relaxation
then Crows are that group.
Watch them because they're
going places.
Canned Heat came on to
an enthusiastic reception
from a crowd obviously un-
deterred by the not-so-enthu-
siastic reviews the group had
received on this tour. On the
numbers for which he was
featured singer/guitarist Joel
Scott-Hill proved himself a
more-than-adequate replace-
ment for A l Wilson without
trying to sound like him, al-
though most of the time Hill
played rhythm guitar to
Henry Vestine's lead. As well
as new numbers like "Long
- Way from L A " they included
old favourites "Let's Work
Together", "Goin' up Coun-
try" and the inevitable "Re-
fried Boogie" which the
crowd were shouting for all
night. We were treated to a
30 minute version featuring
a fairly free-form, but not
too long solo from Vestine,
an organ break from Tony
Ashton, who is acompanying
the group on this tour, and a
drum solo from Fitb de la
Parra which even in these
days when super drum solos
are ten-a-new-penny was
truly phenomenal.
The music critics are al-
ways quick to kick a group
when they're down and since
the death of A l Wilson Heat
have suffered rather badly
at the hands of the press.
How much of the criticism
was justified I don't know,
but now they really are as
good as ever, and I hope this
performance proved it once
and for all.

Anti-Apartheid
'What I do foresee, and
what I hope will happen, is
that majorities will refuse to
allow minorities to dictate to
them and threaten them with
violence if they cannot have
their way'-—B. J. Vorster,
Premier of South Africa,
September 10th, 1971, on
Australian cancellation of the
Springbok cricket tour.
Mr. Vorster, it seems, is
determined to continue his
racist policies and to main-
tain the police state in South
Africa which makes white
supremacy possible. Most
people in this country abhor
Vorster (who was interned
during the Second World War
for Nazi activities) and his
apartheid policies yet seem
to do little about it. Indeed
the present Tory government
is encouraging his regime by
supplying arms to South
Africa, in defiance of the
U.N. and refusing to stop or
even curb British investments
there. The Tories are even
talking about a negotiated
settlement with Rhodesia
when it is clear that any such
settlement will be a sell-out
to racism.
The main movement out-
side South Africa attacking
apartheid is the Anti-Apar-
theid movement. This is bas-
ed here in England because
we still have many links with
South Africa; British capital
makes up 60 per cent of all
foreign investment there. The
Anti-Apartheid movement
aims to destroy apartheid by
isolating white South Africa
from all forms of sporting
and cultural contact, by at-
tacking the capitalist system
in South Africa by pressuriz-
ing British firms to cease in-
vestment, by stopping arms
getting to South Africa and
by supporting the Freedom
Fighters there.
The recent successes of the
movement, particularly in
isolating South Africa from
international sport, has made
it Vorster's main enemy out-
side Africa. The Anti-Apar-
theid movement is watchful
for attempts by Vorster to
destroy it, especially as it was
revealed recently that South
African security agents were
in this country, supposedly
for 'training', and were re-
ceiving co-operation from
Scotland Yard.
There has 'been talk recent-
ly of setting up an Anti-
Apartheid movement within
I.C. There are many aspects
of Anti-Apartheid policy
which can be applied here.
Notably within the Royal
School of Mines where schol-
arships are offered to white
South African students to
study here. It is already Stu-
ready Student Union policy
no South African food here,
in the refectories, but an
Anti-Apartheid movement
could act as a watch-dog to
ensure this was being enforc-
ed. It could also try and
make students aware of Brit-
ish firms with investments in
South Africa so that their
goods can be boycotted. An-
other sphere where an Anti-
Apartheid movement could
be useful is in exposing rac-
ial discrimination within an
area where many I.C. stud-
ents live, namely Notting
Hill.
It is hoped to have a meet-
ing soon with a speaker from
Anti-Apartheid. Anyone in-
terested should contact either
Jill Dare, Trevor Pinch or
Roger Werry via Physics 2
letter rack.
