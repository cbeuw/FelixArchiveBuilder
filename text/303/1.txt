IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION 21st OCTOBER 1971 No. 303
Britain's
First
Pizza Race
U.S.K. Rag's first fund-raising event of the year took
place at the opening of South Ken's new Pizza Palace, the
sickeningly-titled "Pizza Resistance", in Exhibition Road
on Sunday week. The main event of the opening was what
the owners proudly announced was Britain's first-ever Pizza
Race, which, for the uninitiated, is exactly the same as a
pancake race—except, of course, that you toss pizzas instead
of pancakes. The whole affair was obviously the brainchild
of an even-more-than-usually eccentric P.R. agency, and
came complete with so-called Bunny Girls (minus tails and
long ears) and balloons, eagerly clutched (the balloons, not
the girls) by an enthusiastic crowd of the local youth.

The first race was run by
the five presidents of the I.C.
unions, and was won, just,
by Dave Amos, vice-presi-
dent of I.C., who apparently
collected a free pizza as
prize. The other race in
which the athletic types of
I.C. (all ten of them) took
part was actually won by the
only other entrant—a 13-
year-old boy!! Luckily they,
together with the other fifty
or so College supporters, had
more joy when it came to
collecting for the rag fund.
Here, though, they were in
competition with collectors
for the Mayor of Kensing-
ton's Play Association
appeal, who collected £50,
for which amount a cheque
was presented to the Mayor
after the races.

How many pizzas they
succeeded in selling by means
of this happening is anyone's
guess and their accountant's
nightmare, but the assembled
multitude at the opening cer-
tainly seemed to be enjoying
themselves, even though I
didn't see anybody eating a
pizza at all. The restaurant
itself is actually in the base-
ment, although they're confi-
dent enough to put the
kitchens on display in the
front window (which is more
than Mooney does). Prices
are quite reasonable: pizzas
cost from 35p up to 60p for
the Pizza Resistance itself: a
'Hamburger Steak', though,
can cost you 80p . . . the
mind boggles!!!
News in Brief
W h o does she
think she i s ?
How I hate getting up
early! But there we are—
following a summons to see
a certain housekeeper, Lin-
stead housekeeper, and I am
prompt, there I was at her
office at the published open-
ing times.
Finding the good lady ab-
sent, and not wishing to miss
my first lecture, I decided to
seek her at her place. The
good lady took this as an in-
tolerable intrusion, and we
hence eventually arrived at
her office, where the door
was closed against me.
So I knocked and entered,
and the interview com-
menced thirty minutes late.
Rivals to T e s c o ?
A review of the Southside
Shop is to take place next
week. The means of com-
municating your grievances
and recommendations is nu-
clear, but dedicated Felix
reporters have it on best in-
formation that the review
may comprise McClooge and
Amos breezing in for a look
around. A recent Felix Probe
strongly criticised the lack of
savoury biscuits.
Mooneyoni
Lunchtime O'Bric-a-Brac
Amateur entomologist and
part-time catering manager,
Victor Mooney, must be
congratulated, if Union re-
ports that the refectories are
currently in the black are to
be believed. Apparently Beit
refectory is doing well in
response to the increased use
of the Lower Lounge.
Yorkshire Pud
Found in
'Cockroach
Special
It is bad enough to wake up to another day at IC but
when a rather sinister-looking and tastefully-wrapped parcel
delivered to your bedside turns out to contain a half-eaten
piece of Yorkshire Pudding with a Mooney patent cockroach
in some, you immediately leap for action and that is what
your editor did—and by 10 o'clock that evening a reporter
was grilling Mr. Mooney (now that's a good idea . . .)
We quote his report in full
"Saw Mr. Mooney at 10
p.m.
'Probably a cockroach,
we've had some trouble with
them. The place has been
sprayed several times!'
The chef, when asked to
comment, said that this was
not necessary as we had all
the evidence. He then said
that any place can expect to
have a few cockroaches.
Mr. Mooney told him not
to say that as the magazine
would go to town on that.
(And, folks, here we are!)
Finally decided that it
might have come out of the
flour used to make the York-
shire Pudding.
Mr. Mooney said that the
insects had probably got into
the kitchens in the cardboard
containers originally used to
transport foodstuffs. He
apologised and said that they
try to do what they can to
with a few explanatory notes :
prevent these instances
occurring.
When the chef looked at
the exhibit, he broke a few
bits off but reluctantly gave
it back to me!!"
The implications of this
are really serious—apart
from trivia about the clean
foods Act, Public Health in-
spectors and the like—think
of all the changes that will
have to be made to our
national folk-lore. No more
jokes about 'waiter there's a
fly in my soup'—or indeed
'waiter, there's soup in my
flies'.
We shall all have to change
over to cockroaches—be-
cause who are we to contra-
dict the chef's warning that
we can soon expect our
kitchens to be well populated
by these friendly (and tasty)
little insects?
