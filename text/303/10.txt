I have j u s t been reminded that ' F e l i c i t y ' means happiness, or something of
the s o r t , and t h a t t h i s week's issue so fai* has not been p a r t i c u l a r l y
happy or l i g h t - h e a r t e d , .
I t i s a l s o suggested t h a t Ishould therefor* reproduce herewith t h i s morn-

of space to f i l l (we c o u l d leave them b l a n k , of course, but i t seems so
hare . . . . ) the E d . would a p p r e c i a t e some c r i g i n a l s p a c e - f i l l e r s , or a
