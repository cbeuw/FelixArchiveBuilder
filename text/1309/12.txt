By James Devine
A long time ago in
Hammersmith, there lived a
man called Colonel Browne,
who had a friend called Mr
James. Together they used to
build cars under the name of
James & Browne.
For the most part, they were
pretty ordinary. Only two
James & Browne cars which
rolled off the Hammersmith
production line are still in
existence, one of which is
Boanerges (also known as
Bo’), built in 1902.
Bo’ (as many of you may
know) is currently owned by
Imperial College and is the
official motorised mascot of
the President of the City &
Guilds College Union. The
other car lives in Devon,
currently owned by a Mr
Proctor, who inherited it
from his father and grand-
father, a former employee of
the James & Browne motor
company.
As some of the more senior
members of the college may
remember, there were big cel-
ebrations to mark Bo’s cente-
nary at the National Motor
Heritage Museum, in Gaydon.
As these were attended by
Mr Proctor and his James &
Browne, it seemed only fitting
that, on the occasion of his
car’s centenary, a delegation
from Imperial should go and
pay him a visit in Devon. And
so the adventure began...
A week after the ordeal
of the summer term, the
devoted members of Team
Bo’ returned to College and
began preparing the City &
Guilds mascot for another
long journey. We decided to
load Bo’ onto a trailer for the
trip down to Dartmoor, as he
wasn’t designed to face the
Friday morning rush hour.
After squeezing every tool in
the entire garage into a union
minibus and hitching up the
trailer, complete with car, we
set off for Devon.
Unfortunately, team mem-
ber Dave had not made it
to the garage by the time of
our departure, but we set off
anyway. This worked out for
the best, as we were able to
divert Dave as he raced to
catch up with us. We sent him
to collect a large quantity of
alcohol, which came in handy
for the weekend.
Newly qualified towing-
Jedi Dan Lehmann drove the
minibus plus trailer through
the traffic and torrential rain,
whilst most of the team slept
like babies in the back. After a
quickstopforessentialre-fuel-
ling (BK Whopper Burgers all
round), we arrived at a ran-
dom Little Chef and decanted
Bo’ from the trailer. It took
about an hour to secure the
exhaust pipes, which had fall-
en off the day before during a
particularly energetic tuning
run down Kensington Church
Street.
We cruised for a couple of
laps of RNAS Yeovilton and
posed for photos of Bo’ next
to a Harrier jump jet. Just as
we were getting close to flying
(on four wheels) down proper
country lanes, the gear selec-
tion mechanism imploded
during a three point turn.
Driver James (in his dubious
wisdom) decided that it could
be more thoroughly fixed if
the linkage was totally dis-
mantled by the roadside. As
soon as it had been stripped
from the car and split into a
large number of delicate look-
ing pieces, it started to rain.
40 very wet minutes later,
James had managed to put
the linkage back together.
When Bo’ was back in run-
ning order, the rain immedi-
ately stopped and we drove on
towards the ‘campsite’. This
just happened to be the front
garden of a friendly family in
the village of Curry Rivel. To
be more precise, the family
were in fact the current resi-
dents of a house which had
been inhabited by the original
owner of the 1904 car. Team
Bo’ pitched a couple of tents
(one for Bo’ and one for us),
before departing on the bus
for the village of Longport.
We spent the evening enjoy-
ing hospitality of local public
houses, before posing for a
photo outside of the amus-
ingly named Longport Tackle
Shop and returning to our
adopted front garden for
some after-hours port drink-
ing.
Soon the sun was ris-
ing over the rolling hills of
Devon. Bo’ was wheeled out
of the tent and given an all-
over polish. Special mention
should go to the expert pol-
ishing skills demonstrated by
Simon. Dan Lehmann even
got out a special white mark-
er pen to write ‘Dunlop’ down
the side of Bo’s tyres, much to
the amusement of everyone
else. At about this point, Mr
Proctor arrived in his James
& Browne, which for some
reason is much quieter than
Bo’, but we still heard him
coming.
A fair number of Team Bo’
were still nursing sore heads
from the night before, but
Bo’ was looking fantastically
shiny, all just in time for a
photographer from the local
newspaper to turn up. Guilds
regalia at the ready, we posed
for several photos with both
cars parked side by side,
before driving up and down
the nearest country lane,
attempting to run the photog-
rapher over as he took pic-
tures of us heading straight
towards him. He insisted on
standing in the middle of the
road, only to leap head first
into the Hawthorne hedge-
row each time we got close.
Bo’ soon tired of posing
for photos. The gear selec-
tion mechanism promptly
imploded once again. This
time James just realigned
the linkage, rather than going
through the totally unneces-
sary process of taking the
whole thing apart.
In the afternoon, we drove
the two James & Browne cars
down into the centre of Curry
Rivel for their annual village
fête. Initially we were given
a parking space on the vic-
ar’s immaculate newly con-
creted driveway. After about
40 minutes, Bo’ had left his
oily mark on the floor, so we
decided to move up towards
the village green before our
oil leaks got us into trouble
with the clergy. Having the
only two surviving James &
Browne cars together for the
afternoon certainly provided
an exciting edge to the village
fair, the other highlights of
which included a tombola and
traditional maypole dancing.
Once the frivolity of the fair
had died down, our accompa-
nying Team Bo’ alumni took
Bo’ out for a quick spin down
the village lanes, with Paul
at the helm, ably assisted by
Pete in the role of co-driver
and Jez hanging on in the
back seat. The current stu-
dents amongst the team
returned to our campsite to
make themselves presentable
for the evening. Mr Proctor
had kindly arranged for us to
dine on the ‘Dartmoor Belle’,
a special volunteer staffed
rail service which operates
on the Okehampton Line.
This was no ordinary train
– we had a whole first class
carriage to ourselves and
enjoyed a sumptuous three
course dinner with lashings
of wine. Good, clean (genu-
inely first class) fun. Even
the usually serious Matt was
amused. After dinner, we
retired to the train’s custom-
built function carriage, where
the onboard jazz quartet were
playing requests and the bar
was serving large measures
of Glen Morangie whiskey.
Bo’ had been safely garaged
for the night with Mr Proctor,
so after the evening’s enter-
tainment, Team Bo’ retired
to the nearby Okehampton
youth hostel. Sunday was
spentaspartofastaticdisplay
of veteran and classic vehi-
cles at the recently restored
Okehampton Station. We
managed the occasional lap
of the car park, in between
explaining the car’s history
to visiting tourists and inter-
ested passers-by.
At the end of the morning
session, we snuck Bo’ off into
a corner of the car park to
give Dan Reader, next year’s
Bo’ Driver, a first opportunity
at the controls. He soon man-
aged to find first gear, and
eventually second as well,
before racing around the car
park at the breakneck speed
of 10 miles per hour. After
the driving lesson had fin-
ished, we parked Bo’ outside
the station and disappeared
inside for lunch.
Upon returning to inspect
the car, we found that honor-
ary Team Bo’ member and
ex-C&G president Shrenik
Patel was curled up in the
back seat, fast asleep. As
the evening approached, we
loaded Bo’ back onto the trail-
er and started on the long
journey back to College. All
in all, a very successful and
enjoyable adventure with our
motorised mascot!

The Imperial College Choir
has had a busy term in
preparation for our forth-
coming concert on Friday 10
December. We are perform-
ing an exciting programme,
including the well known
Mozart Requiem and Bach’s
Magnificat.
The term began with
excellent recruitment at the
Freshers’ Fair, and with 180
members the choir is now the
largest it has ever been. Our
Freshers’ welcome event,
Champagne & Nibbles, was
particularly enjoyable, giving
everyone the opportunity to
meet new people and sample
some fine cava!
One of the annual autumn
term highlights is singing
at the Royal Albert Hall for
Commemoration Day. The
choirsangatbothceremonies,
performing the Hallelujah
Chorus from The Mount of
Olives by Beethoven, which
was well received by the audi-
ence.
To supplement our weekly
rehearsals on Thursday eve-
nings in the Great Hall, we
travelled to Silwood Park for
a day of intensive rehearsal in
beautiful and calm surround-
ings. As well as plenty of
productive rehearsals, there
was also time to explore the
grounds and socialise.
As we are now in advent,
it is the time of year when
choirs start to sing carols,
and the chamber choir will be
performing at the Imperial
College carol service at Holy
Trinity church on Wednesday
8 December. As well as the
traditional carols for every-
one to join in, the choir will
also be singing some special
Christmas pieces.
Everyone is welcome to
come and join the choir, and
if you would like to come
and join us next term to sing
Brahms’s Requiem, then
please email the chair at
icchoir@ic.ac.uk for further
information. If you would like
to hear about future choir
events, please email lucy.
abbott@imperial.ac.uk to be
added to the events mailing
list, or why not visit our web-
site, www.union.ic.ac.uk/arts/
choir.
The Choir concert is on
Friday 10 December at 8pm
in the Great Hall. Tickets
are £4 for students and £8
for non-students on the door,
but are cheaper in advance,
and can be purchased from
