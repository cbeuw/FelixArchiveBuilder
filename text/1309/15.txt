Competitions
Win a mobile phone worth £120
‘Tis the season to get jolly and snap happy! Take a photo of your mate this holiday when they’re looking worse for wear and Virgin Mobile will
reward the most mischievous photographer with their very own Sony Ericsson T610 camera phone worth £120.
To celebrate the launch of Virgin Mobile’s great new infotainment service, BITES, and its scandalous ‘Worse for Wear’ gallery of the all time best
pictures, we’re encouraging you to get creative on your festive booze fuelled evenings out and send us the evidence. We’re talking underpants on
your head, lipstick moustaches and squirty cream bikinis – as if you need any encouragement!
BITES is an exciting new boredom busting service which offers downloads, competitions, gossip and a laugh straight to your phone. Free to use
until February 2005, BITES is the perfect antidote to boredom, offering bite-sized entertainment on demand. For more information visit www.virgin-
mobile.com/bites. Virgin Mobile customers call 22522 to set-up on BITES.
To enter, hand your photo in to the Felix office in the West Wing of Beit Quad,
or email it to felix@ic.ac.uk
