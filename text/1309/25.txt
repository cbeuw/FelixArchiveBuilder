History... Hollywood Style. No change there then
Harry Enfield, Vic Reeves, Bob
Mortimer, Sally Philips, Rik Mayall,
Ronni Ancona, Phil Cornwell, David
Schneider and Mackenzie Crook.
The cream of British comedy join
Hollywood’s Christian Slater and
Neve Campbell to rewrite the histo-
ry books for our dubious entertain-
ment in Churchill: The Hollywood
Years.
For the first time in the history of
film reviewing, I have decided to call
upon scientific method to deduce
exactly how funny this movie was.
In order to do this, I’m introducing
a new measure of ‘funniness’ that
is simply measured by ‘laughs per
joke’.
Now,thedirectorPeterRichardson
is famous for writing the late-night
TV comedy Stella Street – which
is an extremely ‘hit-and-miss’ pro-
gramme whose laughs per joke
ratio usually registers at around
0.2 (about a fifth of the jokes are
funny). This is pretty bad going for
a TV show (compared to The Fast
Show, for instance, which registers
at around 0.6). But when measur-
ing the laughs per joke ratio for
Churchill: The Hollywood Years, I
found it to be closer to around 0.13
– which is ridiculously low, especial-
ly for a feature length film. On this
‘scientific’ basis alone, the movie
was a dismal failure.
But forgetting the scientific meth-
od for a moment, what could I say
about a movie whose premise is
that the Winston Churchill we know
and respect was actually an after-
dinner speaker and character actor
called Roy Bubbles? What could I
say about a movie that has a joke
about Hitler driving a car straight
into a wall? What could I say about
a movie that tries to take one of the
grimmest periods of modern history
and turn it into a comedic farce?
You could say ‘congratulations’
because despite being a patched-up,
nonsensical sequence of tenuously
connected sketches, in Churchill:
The Hollywood Years there are
genuinely a few decent laughs to
be had. Although it is not in the
same league as the sickeningly
hilarious Bad Santa (which meas-
ures at around 0.75 laughs per joke),
it will provide a decent evening’s
light entertainment thanks to the
comedic talents of Harry Enfield,
Phil Cornwell (Dave Clifton from
I’m Alan Partridge) and Vic Reeves,
who embellish the film with a few
memorable scenes.
So once you’ve realised after
the first five minutes that this is not
going to be a conventional experi-
ence – once you have accepted that
and somewhat changed your expec-
tations, then the rest is plain sailing
and rather enjoyable.
