Imperial should be primarily
for the British
Dear Editor,
I have for the last two years had
the impression that our Rector has
been running Imperial more like a
corporation with profit as its incen-
tive than an academic institution.
Last week’s front page article on
the massive proposed increase in
International students confirms this
along with other measures such as
his ridiculous re-branding exercise
and his love for new buildings and
constant refurbishment.
I came to Imperial as an interna-
tional student thinking that I was
a part of a small minority of inter-
national students who would add
something to the cultural and social
life of the students. I now feel that I
am actually a part of an ever grow-
ing quantity of people that are deny-
ing British students a place at a
good academic institution. Imperial
is a British university supported by
taxpayer’s money and hence should
primarily source Britain with much
needed engineers, doctors and
scientists etc. If all the places in
English universities are taken up
by foreign students, who then move
back to their country, where will
Britain’s professionals come from?
Where should British students go to
university?
Besides how can the Rector justify
not only supporting top-up fees but
also turning Imperial into a cash
and carry business when at the
same time he plans to spend up to
£400 million in the coming few years
on things which are not necessar-
ily essential. For example, spending
£17 million on a sports centre is
unnecessary when we have on of the
most famous parks in the world on
our doorstep.
His proposals also mean that it
doesn’t matter if two people have
the same intelligence, the ‘rich kid’
gets the prize. I have not come to
Imperial because India does not
have good science institutions, it
has some that outrank Imperial. I
came because of its name (which I
now think is overrated) and because
I was not intelligent enough to get
into a good science college in India,
and off-course because mummy and
daddy are rich. I feel it is similar for
a lot of the International students
that come here.
If I had to do it all over again,
I would not come to a university
run by a hard core capitalist. It is
wrong to have the ex-head of a huge
corporation that has the reputation
of a merciless profit maker as the
head Imperial. If he wishes to run
Imperial like a business, the govern-
ment should withdraw its charity
status. So lets start by cutting the
useless costs and we shall take it
from there. Note, the above views
are primarily for undergraduate
studies, I imagine the research com-
munity works differently.

Student discount difficulties
Dear Dave,
I have just had a rather difficult
experience obtaining my student dis-
count at HMV. Upon presentation of
my Imperial swipe card, the cashier
told me that it was for memebers of
the NUS only. I protested, informing
him that this was illegal, and asked
to speak to a manager. The manager
told me the same, and asked me if I
had any other student ID cards.
Opening my wallet, I spotted the
HMV student discount card I had
picked up at Freshers Fair and
forgotten about, and triumphantly
presented it. I was informed that I
should only have been given this if
I had a NUS card. I told them that
HMV staff were giving them out
here, and he relented, and gave me
the discount “just this once”, telling
me it was company policy to only
give discounts to member of the
NUS. I told him this was illegal; he
didn’t seem to care.
HMV’s website tells a differ-
ent story. http://www2.hmv.co.uk/
hmvweb/navigate.do?ctx=1099;-
1;-1;-1&pPageID=1103 says “If you
are a NUS cardholder, HMV.co.uk
are giving away 10% off purchases
until 30th September 2005. If you
do not have a NUS cards you will
need a HMV Student card to receive
your discount. You can get a HMV
Student Card from any HMV store
in the UK or Ireland on presentation
of valid student photo ID.”
It would appear that HMV’s staff
are ill-informed of company policy,
and so I will also be writing to HMV
to inform them of this. If I had not
been so persistent, I may have been
denied the discount.
When are the retailers going to
realise that NUS membership is no
longer valid as a verification of stu-
dent status?

Union sandwich prices
Dear Felix,
Last Friday I was persuaded to go to
our so called Student Union for din-
ner (or lunch as you Southern people
call it). After deciding against some
dodgy looking chilli we went to the
sandwich bar in dBs. Advertised for
£1.50 was a chicken tikka baguette,
which seemed reasonable enough.
But on closer inspection we real-
ised that this was the price for the
filling alone – it would cost another
£1 on top of the £1.50 for the sand-
wich, as apparently at our subsi-
dised union it costs £1 for a plain
baguette. Horrified at this, we went
to ‘Sandwich World’ on Gloucester
Road where the very same chicken
tikka baguette was available freshly
made for a total of £1.50, plus an
optional free piece of fruit.
So my point is this – if an inde-
pendent sandwich shop 2 minutes
from the Huxley building can pro-
duce the same sandwich and others
like it for around £1.50 how can our
supposedly subsidised union charge
an extra £1? The cost of living in
London is high enough as it is, with-
out our own student services trying
to rob us blind.

Tolerance?
Dear Editor,
I would like to complain about this
article on your last issue (Thursday
2nd December 2004).
I was very pleased to see an arti-
cle dealing with the unease to be
christian in th 21st century and
think that this article had the point.
Unfortunately, the author Victoria
Pollock tried to support her ideas
with charism, but a bad instance with
the French law banned any ostenta-
tious faith signs in the French state
school. By this way, she broadcast
nonsense about French statement
and obviously did not realize that
she contradicts herself.
This instance have been made to
support her statement that the soci-
ety were tolerant until people decide
to pursue tolerance as a definite
objective. And Victoria had not the
point on this part of her article.
The 1905 French Law have been
written to allow children, whose reli-
gion was not christian, to have the
opportunity to access a state school.
This law supported egality among
children when they entered any
state schools. Last years this law
has been discussed again to rein-
force the law in order to give a free
access to the “laic” state schools.
The French Law is neither toler-
ant nor intolerant. We missed the
point. In fact, France is a laic coun-
try, in which any religion have nei-
ther right nor links with the state
autorithy. France supported last
year its laicity.
I agree with Victoria that the
French Republican Pact let some
French unsatisfied. I agree that reli-
gions autorithy criticised the rein-
forcement of this Law. But Victoria’s
statement was not supported by her
instance.
I ask her tolerance for the French
laicity. In trying to support her belief,
she offends mine with this pick on
our decision.

Christmas trees
Dear Editor,
I have been noticing the growing
numbers of Christmas trees every-
where. I even saw one shop on the
high street which had about four
of them, big ones as well. It really
disturbed me to think that so many
trees are being cut just to give us a
bit of aesthetic pleasure. In the case
of shops, the trees are just another
tool to sell more and make more
money by putting everyone in the
“festive spirit”. What is Christmas
really about anymore?
After thinking about it further, it
seems even more absurd that it is
supposed to celebrate the birth of
Christ. We are killing something in
celebration of the birth of something
else. Perhaps having a small tree or
plant in a pot or a large one if can
afford it will be more appropriate.
Lets celebrate life.
Happy Christmas,

Jamie Brothwell seems very keen
that we should all buy fair trade
products, to the point of creating a
bureaucracy to check that we do.
I’m perfectly happy for him to
pay any price that the suppliers
and growers agree to, including one
which is above the market value.
But before there is a “campaign for
increased consumption of Fairtrade
goods” (funded by our infinitely-
bounteous Union I suppose), people
should be aware of the problems of
Fairtrade.
When buying Fairtrade coffee
you are charitably giving to cer-
tain selected groups of produc-
ers. Selected, that is, by the Fair
Labeling Organisation, which charg-
es $2431 plus $607/year plus $1 per
110 pounds of coffee sold to be certi-
fied as a Fair Trade producer. And
if you’re a small producer (that is,
less than 44,000 pounds of coffee per
year – $55,440 per year, by FairTrade
base prices) then I’m afraid that
the FLO “seldom” certifies groups
so small [Simen Sandberg, quoted
in The Christian Science Monitor,
April 13th].
The problem with the primary
Fairtrade produce, coffee, is that
too much of it is being produced
worldwide. In Brazil and Columbia,
producers were encouraged to
switch from cocaine to coffee. In an
effort to rebuild Vietnam, aid went
into setting up coffee plantations so
that the farmers could be self-suf-
ficient. This led to an over-supply of
coffee.
The average coffee production per
year increased 28% from 1990 to
2002 [ICO figures], but the values
jump wildly – not the sign of a sta-
ble market. All this over-supply, of
course, caused the price to drop
and the less efficient producers to
suffer. The inefficient producers in
this case were the small, primitive
farmers who Fairtrade is supposed
to help.
But Fairtrade gives the efficient
producers less incentive to cut
costs and keeps those farmers for-
ever at the mercy of the charity of
those who buy Fairtrade and of the
FLO, which soon gains the power
to select who will and who won’t
survive.
Instead of this Jamie, perhaps
we should be lobbying for the elim-
ination of EU subsidies such as
the Common Agricultural Policy
(though not through the Union of
course, because everyone agrees
that the Union should limit itself to
those issues which affect students
as students, don’t they?)
The idiotic effects of the CAP
have entered into common usage:
“butter mountains”, “wine lakes”
etc. In 2001, 7m tonnes of sugar
was exported [Oxfam, 2002] from
the EU, and the EU taxpayer paid
a total of $2.1bn to subsidise this
dumping on the world markets.
The development of internal trade
(especially within Africa) and the
cessation of dumping under-priced
goods on the world market is the
way to help these farmers. Hitching
them to our charity, which is sup-
ported only by the public’s wonder-
ing attention, is not.
Unfair trade?
