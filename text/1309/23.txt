2. The Last Samurai
It was an absolute travesty that this
movie didn’t win any Oscars. Cruise
should have got recognition for his
best performance to date. Instead of
the usual showman, he was a more
pensive character with a lot of inner
torment.
The movie wonderfully recreated
the patterns and textures of the
Japanesepast;itsproductiondesign,
sets and costumes were astonish-
ing. The battle scenes were stirring
and elegantly mounted. They were
less about who wins and more about
what could be proven by dying.
Beautifully designed, intelligently
written, acted with conviction, this
was an uncommonly thoughtful
epic. Much more than just an action
flick.

3. Bad Santa
Bad Santa was a demented, twisted,
unreasonably funny work of comic
kamikaze style.
Santa is a depressed, alcoholic
safecracker. The kid is not one of
your cute movie kids, but an intense
and needy stalker. The elf is an
angry dwarf who has been working
with Santa for eight years, cracking
the safe in a different department
store every Christmas.
The elf is fed up. Santa gets drunk
on the job, he’s bonking customers
in the Plus Sizes dressing room, and
whether the children throw up on
Santa or he throws up on them is a
toss-up, no pun intended.
This movie will offend your moth-
er’s virtue, with so many four letter
words. It’s quite possible the most
politically incorrect movie I’ve seen
in a long time.
Whilst it was never going to win
any Oscars, or smash any records
at the box office, this was sicken-
ingly funny.
4. Infernal Affairs
The movie that inspired me to write
about movies – I just had to try
to convince as many as possible
to watch this. It was, and might
still be, the best movie to come out
of Hong Kong. It combined exhila-
rating action with liquid nitrogen
existential cool, gleaming and shim-
mering with the city of Hong Kong’s
glass and steel. The plot twisted and
turned, rivalling the best of thrillers
out there. Infernal Affairs was a
gripping thriller with grandstanding
drama, muscle-clenching suspense
and two great action leads in Tony
Leung and Andy Lau.
1. Spiderman 2
Few sequels surpass their predeces-
sor. Spiderman 2 went past and
well beyond anything Spiderman
accomplished.
Spiderman 2 was what a superhe-
ro movie should be. It wasn’t camp,
nostalgic, it wasn’t wall-to-wall spe-
cial effects and it wasn’t pickled in
angst. It was simply and poignantly
a realization that being Spiderman
is a burden that Peter Parker is not
entirely willing to bear. The movie
demonstrates what’s wrong with a
lot of other superhero epics: they
focus on the superpowers, and short-
change the humans behind them.
Some might say that the movie
was far too slow, but that’s what I
was so impressed with – how intelli-
gently Spiderman 2 dealt with such
adult themes as responsibility and
sacrifice.
When it did come round to the
fight scenes, they were superb. Doc
Ock’s arms looked brilliant, with the
change from puppetry to CGI unno-
ticeable.
It could have been such a one-
dimensional blockbuster. Instead it
chose to be far more intelligent, and
left me wanting more.
5. Saw
The best horror movie I ‘Saw’ this
year. The final twist was so large
and unforeseeable that I never saw
it coming. The twists were aston-
ishing and the pain was palpable.
The premise was fantastic and origi-
nal. The execution was slightly less
than breathtaking though; the two
lead actors were slightly erratic.
This was made up for by the great
camera work and ambience though,
really providing a claustrophobic
feel. The costume of the villain is
genuinely nerve wracking. It made
the hairs on my back stand to atten-
tion, and did such a good job of scar-
ing me that I’m not even sure I want
to buy the DVD.
