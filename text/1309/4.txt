In January 2005, the Huygens probe will attempt to land on the largest moon in the
solar system. What it will find there remains a complete mystery to scientists.

It’s raining methane today. A
dramatic storm is throwing up
huge waves of methane that
lash the ice cliffs. From out of
the orange clouds descends
a metal disc suspended from
a large parachute. Inside the
disc, sensors hum analyzing
the chemical and physical
properties of the atmosphere
while cameras record the
tumult below and the view
out to the horizon. The disc
approaches the ocean emit-
ting a pulsing sound, sensors
alert to echoes from the sur-
face and the ocean’s depths,
before disappearing into the
crashing surf.
Bad science fiction?
Possibly. But it’s also a plausi-
ble scenario for the Huygens
mission to Saturn’s moon
Titan in January 2005. The
basic elements – methane
rain, a hydrocarbon ocean
with huge waves, and cliffs of
ice – were outlined by one of
the British scientists involved
in the mission, John Zarnecki
of the Open University, during
a press conference in London
last June. They are all rea-
sonable guesses based on
the rather limited data avail-
able: Titan is certainly cold
enough for methane and the
other simple hydrocarbons
present to be liquid and for
water only to be present as
ice. Zarnecki has even collab-
orated with oceanographers
at Southampton to predict
what waves would look like
on a liquid methane ocean
on Titan (big, apparently). On
the other hand, some have
noted that the same data
are consistent with the less
romantic sounding possibility
of a surface coated in a thick,
oily sludge.
The truth is, Titan is one of
the most mysterious objects
in our solar system. It is per-
manently shrouded in a thick
orange smog that, until last
month’s close encounter with
the Saturn orbiter Cassini,
has completely obscured the
surface from human view.
Cracking Titan’s secrets may
have wider implications for
scientific knowledge than
merely filling in a gap in our
knowledge of the solar sys-
tem. Titan’s atmosphere of
nitrogen and hydrocarbons
is intriguingly similar to that
believed to have been present
on the early earth. Perhaps
studying Titan will give us
a window on our own plan-
et’s past. While the extreme
cold of the surface (a chilly
–180ºC) rules out the pres-
ence of ‘life as we know it,
Jim’, the processes going on
at the surface are anyone’s
guess right now.
The moment of truth.
Friday 14 January 2005,
1.45pm, Germany:
A group of scientists from
around the world are waiting
nervouslyfornewsfromTitan.
If all is going well, Huygens
will have just jettisoned its
heat-shield, opened its first
parachute and started to take
pictures of the view from
around 160km above Titan’s
surface. Over the next two
hours, as it descends to the
surface, Huygens will beam
back images and data from
analyses of the atmosphere
to its mothership, Cassini.
If the probe survives hitting
the surface, whatever that
turns out to be, another set
of sensors will rush through
an analysis of what it has hit,
sending back data as quick
as they can, as no-one knows
how long the probe will sur-
vive. After that, the scientists
back on earth face an agonis-
ing wait while Cassini turns
and transmits this precious
data home.
For many of the scientists
waitingnervouslyinGermany,
this will be the culmination
of over ten years of work.
For the past seven years,
Huygens has piggybacked
on the spacecraft Cassini’s
two billion mile trip through
the solar system. Since July,
Cassini has been orbiting
Saturn, collecting data on
that planet’s famous rings, its
moons and its magnet field.
What nobody knew at the
launch was that Huygens’s
transmitter had a flaw that
could have killed its mission
before it started. A routine
test of this transmitter during
thejourneytoSaturnrevealed
a fault that would have put
the signal reaching Cassini
from Huygens during its
descent outside the frequen-
cy range Cassini could pick
up. Fortunately the mission
co-ordinators found a simple
solution: they plan to re-route
Cassini during the transmis-
sion so that it recedes from
Huygens more slowly than
originally planned. This will
reduce the Doppler effect
(the same effect that causes
the pitch of an ambulance
siren to drop as it speeds
away from you), raising the
frequency of the signal being
received by Cassini into the
range it can detect.
Titan’s atmosphere is both
a blessing and a curse for
the Huygens mission. Having
a much thicker atmosphere
than Mars makes slowing
the probe easier than slow-
ing a lander like Beagle II.
As Beagle II spokesman
Colin Pillinger puts it: “At
least going into Titan, it is an
atmosphere that is going to
stop you.”
But dealing with that
atmosphere poses other prob-
lems. “We’ve got pretty good
at designing instruments
to work in space, but with
Huygens we’re entering a
new atmosphere for the first
time, giving us a whole host of
new problems to deal with”,
explains Martin Tomasko,
head of the team responsi-
ble for Huygens’ imaging
equipment. Data from the
recent Cassini fly-by suggest
that the atmosphere doesn’t
contain corrosive chemicals
that could damage Huygens’
instruments. But there is a
danger that components of
the atmosphere could simply
stick to and obscure the win-
dows from which Huygens’
imaging systems peer.
However, Tomasko is quietly
confident that the windows
will not simply steam up with
hydrocarbon condensation.
He notes that, because the
probe will be warmer than the
atmosphere, it will in effect
have heated windscreens. He
also predicts that the clouds
that shroud Titan will have
a bottom, giving a clear view
from as high as 50-70km.
One of the biggest chal-
lenges for the imaging team
is simply to make sense of
the data they get. “There are
no lack of challenges,” says
Tomasko. “The probe is going
to be swinging, turning and
being blown by the wind.” All
of these factors need to be
taken into account in order to
fit successive pictures togeth-
er into panoramic mosaics
of the landscape below. The
swinging and turning will be
measured by a sun sensor
sitting underneath two slits
on top of the probe: whether
the sun sensor is in shad-
ow or exposed will depend
on the angle and spin of the
probe. Once the probe is out
of the cloud, making mosaic
images should become eas-
ier. “If we can see distinct
features in our images, we
can use these to put mosa-
ics together, rather than rely-
ing on reconstructions from
the movement of the probe,”
explains Tomasko. Despite
these problems, the wait long
for the first images should
not be long. Tomasko and col-
leagues plan to work through
the night on their mosaics so
that they can release their
two best images at a press
conference on 15 January.
What will those pictures
show? Tomasko doesn’t want
to speculate. By his own
admission the first glimpses
of Titan’s surface, gathered
by Cassini during its recent
fly-by, are frankly mystifying.
While some features are vis-
ible – dark regions and light
streaks – no-one seems to
have much of a clue what
any of these features are.
Tomasko seems more com-
fortable predicting what we
will not see. He notes thinks
that the lack of any bright
reflection of sunlight (spec-
ular reflection) in Cassini’s
recent images suggests that
the ocean theory is wrong.
However, some dynamic
process seems to be going on
at the surface. The lack of any
obvious craters also suggests
that the surface is constantly
being remodeled, but by what
process is anyone’s guess.
One thing seems sure: if
the mission goes to plan, in
January 2005 we should have
pictures of a very alien land-
scape indeed.
