The Chess Club is going from
strength to strength this year.
We have been able to recruit
six players with a BCF rating
of more than 150. But we are
still looking for more players,
of all skill levels, to further
strengthen our squad.
The Chess Club meets
every Wednesday at 7pm in
the Union Building (top floor,
seminar room 3).
We are going to have the
inaugural Christmas Dinner
for our members and their
friends. The Dinner will be
on Friday 10 December 2004,
at 7pm in Kwality Tandoori
Restaurant (38 Thurloe
Place, SW7 2HP). Please
email chess@ic.ac.uk if you
would like to come.
Our members will have
the opportunity to play a
grandmaster in January. We
also offer free entry to some
tournaments. If you are not
already a member, it only
costs £5 to become one.
Other events we are plan-
ning to organise include a
summer trip to Greece (this
should provide an excellent
opportunity to use your sum-
mer holiday to have fun with
sightseeing while exercising
your mind with a few games
of chess), an Imperial College
Championship (here the win-
ner and runners-up will get a
prize) and matches against
Oxford and Cambridge (to
see who is at the top of the
game). We are going to elect a
new committee member soon
to help us with the amount of
work we are undertaking.
Since the last edition of
Felix, we have won further
matches, to stay top of both
the Middlesex League and
the ULU League.
In the Middlesex League,
we have won all our match-
es convincingly: 8-0 against
Thames Valley University,
8-0 against LSE, 7-1 against
Harrow, 5-3 against Hendon
and 6-2 against Kings Head. I
don’t think I need to say more
about the performance of our
players here.
In the ULU League, we
have beaten King’s College
both at home (4-2) and away
(5-1). We were pleased when
we outclassed LSE 5-1 at
home. After our strong suc-
cession of results, we fielded
a team mostly comprised of
first year students, who had
expressed their will to play
for the team. We happened to
lose the game 4-2. But, it was
still a fairly good result, as we
played five players (out of six)
who had never represented
Imperial College Chess Club
before.
Donald Pang, the organiser
of the ULU Chess League
(from UCL) commented,
“Well, LSE’s crushing
defeat at the hands of the
Imperialists comes as a fat
surprise to all of us. I’ve also
heard that Imperial won in
the Middlesex league against
LSE 8-0! This means Imperial
is a strong contender for the
trophy. I’ve also heard that
LSE’s team is comprised
solely of players with a rating
of more than BCF 140, which
is a scary thought...”
The current committee
members are doing an excel-
lent job with their organisa-
tional skills. Please email
chess@ic.ac.uk with your
queries, and visit www.union.

Strong contenders for ULU trophy
CHESS CLUB
By Ruth Roberts
and Tom Woodcock
In the beginning God cre-
ated the double bass. And
God heard the double bass,
and that it was good. And
God said, “Let there be piano
and drums”. And God called
his creation ‘rhythm’. And he
thought smugly to himself,
“This is pimp”.
“I’ll addtrumpets,andtrom-
bones. And in front of these
angels of music, I will place
cherubim and seraphim with
saxophones. I shall send the
prophet Jon to strum the gui-
tar and to shout approval at
this band of seraphs. A singer
will spread my word, and that
word shall be ‘swing’…”
On Sunday 29 November,
Imperial College Big Band
took part in the National
Concert Band Festival, held
at Colchester Institute of
Music and Performing Arts,
and won the gold award. This
was one of seven divisional
competitions taking place
across the UK and as such,
the next step will almost
certainly take the band to
the National Finals at the
Royal Northern College of
Music in Manchester. This is
a huge achievement for any
university or college band,
and an unbelievable suc-
cess for one without a music
department.
The band performed a
varied repertoire of three
arrangements. The first was
Nat Adderley’s Work Song.
Soloists Pete Hopcroft (alto
sax) and Martin Cloke (piano),
along with Ant Dearden
(bass), were individually con-
gratulated for their perform-
ances.
This was followed with a
change of pace as singer
Ruth Roberts led the vocal
ballad A Nightingale Sang In
Berkeley Square. The band’s
performance was described
by the adjudicators as refined
and idiomatic.
The stylish conclusion
was Gordon Goodwin’s
Count Bubba. Solos from
Tom Woodcock and Andy
Thorpe (trombone), and Chaz
Robertshaw (alto sax) were
commended. Jan Marchant
led the trumpet section “with
a great sound”.
It was perhaps the most
focused (and sober) perform-
ance the Imperial Big Band
have ever given. Obviously
however, when a break came
up in the schedule, they head-
ed straight to the pub.
Both Imperial College Big
Band and the University of
Surrey (UNIS) attained gold
standard in the open big band
category, the adjudicators
describing both bands’ per-
formances as “at least equal
to the quality of the National
Final last year”. UNIS were
the gold medallists of the
nationwide competition last
year. Imperial Big Band and
UNIS Big Band are now
making plans for a joint gig
in Guildford, followed by a
recording session the next
day.
Imperial College’s Big
Band practice together just
once a week but it was evi-
dent from their performance
that an intricate knowledge of
the pieces and a life-long
habit of listening to the jazz
masters propelled them
through the rhythms and
harmonies in a way that
you can’t get from reading
music. Their enthusiasm and
enjoyment of the music gave
them the quality and charac-
ter that set them apart from
the rest.
OnWednesday15December,
the Big Band will be perform-
ing a Christmas-themed gig
in dBs.

asked how high he could play

The Big Band at the 2004 summer ball

“He caught me and tied me
up and then he started cut-
ting my face. He never said a
word except, ‘This is your last
night...’”
This is the case of Zahida
Parveen, a 32-year-old
Pakistani woman who was
severely beaten by her hus-
band for allegedly having
an affair with her brother-
in-law. In blind anger, her
husband “bound her hands
and feet” and “slashed her
with a razor and knife... Her
earlobes were sliced off, her
nose reduced to a reddened
stump of bone and her eyes
replaced by empty sockets.”
She was three months preg-
nant at the time.

Price of ‘Honour’”, The
Gazette (Montreal), May 22,

This is just one of many
cases of violence perpetrated
against women. Statistics
show that ‘at least one out of
every three women has been
beaten, coerced into sex, or
otherwise abused in her life-
time.’ [Amnesty Pamphlet]
In the UK alone, recorded
acts of violence include hon-
our killings, forced marriage,
rape, sexual violence, traf-
ficking, female genital muti-
lation, physical abuse and
others.
● 167 women are raped each
day
● One woman in nine is
severely beaten by her male
partner each year (Stanko et
al, 1998)
● On average, a woman is
assaulted 35 times before her
first call to the police (Jaffe,
1982)
Amnesty International,
the largest human rights
organization in the world,
recognizes violence against
women as a serious viola-
tion of human rights. This
year, Amnesty has chosen to
highlight this issue by run-
ning a ‘Stop Violence Against
Women’ campaign from the
25 November (International
Day for the Elimination of
Violence Against Women)
until 10 December (World
Human Rights Day).
The Amnesty International
Society here, at Imperial,
has chosen to mark the occa-
sion by organizing a variety
of events, including tabling
sessions in the JCR (this
Thursday and Friday lunch-
times) and a talk by Maryam
Namazi on the violation of
the rights of women (watch
out for more information on
this).
Imperial students can show
their support by attending
the events and actively par-
ticipating in our campaign by
signing petitions, respond-
ing to urgent action letters,
giving donations and getting
your hands messy and leav-
ing your mark on our ban-
ner (literally!) All you have
to do is turn up at a tabling
session.
Amnesty has a host of
other programmes planned
throughout the year. Watch
out for upcoming events
such as the ‘Christmas Card
Campaign’, the ‘Control
Arms’ campaign, the
‘Human Rights and War on
Terror’ campaign and the
‘World Human Rights Day’
protest.
The members of Imperial
College’s Amnesty society
meet up every Thursday at
12noon on the top floor of
the Union building. For more
information, or to join our
society, just turn up at one
of our meetings or contact
oscar.dahlsten@ic.ac.uk.
