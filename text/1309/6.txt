Australia to meet
Kyoto target but
refuses to sign
Australia is on track to meet
targets set by the Kyoto Treaty
to cut greenhouse gas emis-
sions but will still not sign the
pact because it ignores key
areas of the fight against glo-
bal warming in developing
nations. Environment Minister
Ian Campbell said United
Nations talks on global warm-
ing should look beyond the
2012 Kyoto deadline for ways
to tackle climate change.
‘Super rocket’ aims
for January
Europe’s ‘super rocket’, the
Ariane 5-ECA, will be back in
action in January 2005, says
its operator Arianespace. The
launch will be the vehicle’s
first since its maiden flight
ended in an explosive failure in
December 2002. The qualifica-
tion flight was originally sched-
uled for November, but was
then put back after a review
highlighted a number of out-
standing technical issues.
Mission cleared for
Titan plunge
The Huygens probe is on tar-
get and all set for its encoun-
ter with Titan, the mysterious
large moon of Saturn. The
2.7m-wide robot lab has passed
its final systems check-out and
scientists have confirmed the
rendezvous can go ahead on 14
January as planned.
Brazil finds new
Europe-related
dinosaur species
Scientists have found well-pre-
servedfossilsofanewdinosaur
species that lived 225 million
years ago in southern Brazil
but had its closest relatives in
what is now Europe. The find-
ings shed light on the migra-
tion of dinosaurs across the
single continent that existed at
the time. Luciano Leal, a pale-
ontologist, said the Triassic
period dinosaur was “among
the oldest finds in the world.”
New York school
bus driver fired

with her pupils was fired for
inappropriate behaviour. The
Buffalo News said Julianne
Thompson, 42, was fired from
her job in Grand Island, New
York after parents complained
about her discussing the issue

Although many, myself includ-
ed, look forward to Christmas
with almost juvenile glee
and excitement, for others
Christmas is not the season
to be jolly. And no, I am not
talking about the expenditure
(which has already begun to
hit home for me) nor the pros-
pect of being ogled by over-
zealous relatives. Rather,
it is the weather that plays
the villain in the end of year
Christmas pantomime.
Four per cent of over-40s
of both sexes suffer from
COPD – Chronic Obstructive
Pulmonary Disease – a
disease that can affect the
breathing processes of the
sufferer, leading to some cat-
astrophic symptoms. Fatality
is a very real possibility,
even for sufferers who are
admitted to hospital for treat-
ment. Shortness of breath,
increased sputum purulence,
a common cold and wheezing
are the most common symp-
toms associated with the ail-
ment.
The statistics are stagger-
ing. Of those who suffer from
degradations in their condi-
tion (these degradations are
called exacerbations), about
20% are admitted to hospital.
Of those, 15% of admittances
result in mortality within 90
days. Those who survive can-
not be considered safe either
– 27% were readmitted with-
in 90 days having suffered
another exacerbation.
The drain this has on the
NHS is astronomical. I was
left speechless by the scale
of the problem. Each year,
COPD contributes to in the
region of one million bed days
(and 23% of all respiratory
bed days), costing the NHS
about £600m. COPD alone
is responsible for 12% of all
emergency medical admis-
sions. The aforementioned
exacerbations cost up to 45%
of the total cost to the NHS
caused by COPD – about £270
million.
There is, however, a pros-
pect that has the potential
to alleviate some of the bur-
den that this problem exerts.
A pilot scheme is to be run
next year in the South-West
Peninsula Primary Care
Trust of the NHS. The aim is
to use weather forecasts to
predict when the frequency
of exacerbations of the condi-
tion of COPD sufferers will be
at greater incidence. This will
allow the NHS to prioritise
the COPD problem and allow
it to be better prepared to
cope with a greater incidence
of admittances of COPD suf-
ferers.
The new method of treating
COPD, being spearheaded by
the pilot scheme, is to identify
the level of sufferer that is at
significant risk, using weath-
er forecasts to help with this
identification. Weather con-
ditions that increase the
number of exacerbations are
essentially cold tempera-
tures. These are associated
with viral infections which
may precipitate the exacer-
bations and also cause physi-
ological reactions – such as
vasoconstriction reducing
blood flow to the lungs in pref-
erence for the other organs to
reduce heat loss – which can
have derogatory effects on
condition. Similarly, air pol-
lution can be responsible for
exacerbation, hence causing
a greater risk to city COPD
sufferers.
COPD affects different
people to different degrees.
Patients are stratified
according to their level of
susceptance to exacerba-
tions. Those in the “Frequent
Admission Group”, who have
been admitted to hospital
three or more times in the
last 12 months, are regarded
as being those who are at
greatest risk of further exac-
erbation. There are five stra-
ta levels of patients according
to risk.
The forecast is issued twice
weekly, and it identifies those
who might be at risk. For
example, a forecast of “Very
High Activity” would cause
every COPD sufferer to be
contacted to be warned of the
risk and the suggestion of pre-
ventative measures be made.
Plans are made to ensure
that staff can cope with the
expected increase in admis-
sions, and so that they are
more ruthless in discharg-
ing those with lower risk so
patients who are at greater
risk can benefit from more
immediate treatment.
The crux of the scheme is to
treat many sufferers at home
to reduce hospital admis-
sions. These home visits by
nurses and health workers
are safe and effective, an
alternative way of manag-
ing patients who suffer from
exacerbations who would
otherwise need to be admit-
ted to, and possibly have to
stay in, hospital. Antibiotics
can be used to treat puru-
lent sputum and oral pred-
nisolone can be prescribed
to help alleviate breathing
difficulties. Essentially these
visits will allow the patient to
be treated in an environment
that they find more comfort-
able, and will reduce admit-
tances to hospital of people
who may need to stay and
subsequently occupy beds.
In the current hospital situa-
tion, in which beds seem to be
permanently in shortage, this
can help patients who suffer
from other ailments and who
categorically need to be in
hospital for treatment to find
the bed they need.
The reduction in cost will
also liberate much funding
for the NHS to invest in other
areas. In the South-West
Peninsula PCT alone, in 2002
COPD cost the NHS nearly
£15 million, using up 52608
bed days, as there were 239
admissions per 100,000. The
most optimistic estimation is
that these in-house consulta-
tions will reduce admission
rates by up to 40%, saving
£6m and 21043 bed days in
this PCT alone.
The medical staff will be
sent out to someone’s home
following an emergency
call of someone suffering
from an exacerbation. Once
at the patient’s home, it is
then decided if the patient
requires admittance to hospi-
tal according to the serious-
ness of their condition. For
example, if they are severely
breathless with impaired con-
sciousness and a deteriorat-
ing condition, then the patient
would be admitted. If the con-
dition is not immediately seri-
ous, then in house treatment
would be carried out and the
patient be left at home with
guidelines and prescriptions.
Essentially this appears to
be a very convenient arrange-
ment. However, there are
certain aspects that I would
question. Firstly there is the
idea of money. The cost of
the in-house treatment will
still be high, and at times
of low incidence of exacer-
bations this might seem to
be an unnecessary fee. Yet
it is, in my opinion, more a
question of the number of bed
days that are freed as a result
of the in house treatment,
which would undoubtedly
be reduced and allow other
patients to find beds more
easily. This conceivably has
knock-on effects of reducing
waiting times in Accident and
Emergency, for example.
Yet further problems
remain. For example, the
condition of the patient may
exacerbate further after the
medical staff or what have
you have left the patient at
home. What if this further
exacerbation causes a seri-
ous degradation in the con-
dition of the patient? Then
there would be another
time delay before they could
receive medical assistance.
Also what if patients were
discharged from hospital too
soon during a time of “Very
High Activity”, and their con-
dition worsens?
Similarly, what if the Met
Office Predictions are wrong?
Weather predictions can be
notoriously unreliable. What
if the weather conditions
which cause exacerbations
occur without prediction? The
NHS would then be unpre-
pared for the greater than
expected COPD related prob-
lems, which may reduce the
effectiveness of the in house
scheme – what if there are
not enough medical teams to
go around?
Ultimately,thispilotscheme
has the potential to become a
huge success in despite of
these problems. The bene-
fits of a successful pilot are
there for all to see, and for
many to benefit from. At a
time when the NHS is going
to great lengths to increase
efficiency, this seems to be
another brick in the wall.
Yet the problems will need
to be addressed. Teething
problems are to be expected,
but by next Christmas they
should have been ironed out.
If not, then there will be many
who suffer during this time of
merriment.

will also liberate much
