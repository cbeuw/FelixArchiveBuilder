£20bn per year will be wasted
ontheNationalHealthService
(NHS) by 2010, according to
a report by Nick Bosanquet,
Professor of Health Policy at
Imperial College.
According to The Times,
the report concludes that the
NHS is improving, but at a
high and unnecessary cost.
It finds that a reformed serv-
ice could have been provided
for around £90bn per year,
instead of the £110bn that is
likely to be spent by 2010.
Prof Bosanquet said:
“International evidence
shows that reform can be a
pretty powerful way of get-
ting more output from exist-
ing capacity. If we had had
limited extra funds, plus
reforms in the way the
system works, we could
have had a superb NHS
for 9% of GDP
. Instead,
we shall be spending
10.5 to 11% of GDP
,
an extra £20bn. That
would be enough
to fund the entire
social housing programme.”
The report said that a good
example of reform could be
seen in accident and emer-
gency departments, which
have been given only an extra
£30m per year but have great-
ly improved waiting times by
changing working practices.
Prof Bosanquet has a long
track record of healthcare
analysis, having advised the
Health Select Committee
and the World Health
Organisation. The report was
published by the think tank
Reform.

Fourth year aeronautics
students face the difficult
prospect of having only the
two-week Christmas break to
revise for their final exams.
Due to timetabling issues
and the way this year’s
College term dates have been
arranged, they will have to
spend the entire ‘festive’ sea-
son revising for five or six
20-lecture courses.
Stephen Message, a fourth
year student in aeronautics,
told Felix: “It’s absolutely
crazy for revision time to be
this short. I don’t know how
they can honestly say that we
can revise for six 20-lecture
courses in two weeks.”
Lectures run up until the
end of this term, on Friday 17
December, and the first exam
is scheduled for Tuesday 4
January, the first day of the
new term.
Mr Message said: “We’re
not asking for anything that
hasn’t been given in the
past,” adding that in previous
years three or more weeks
have been available for revi-
sion before the fourth year
finals.
Professor Richard Hillier,
head of the aeronautics
department, said that he had
“enormous sympathy about
the need for revision time”
but believed that two weeks
was “a realistic timescale”
in which students should be
able to learn the information
required.
Prof Hillier added that “the
only realistic option is to
move the exams back by two
days”, but even this may not
be possible due to students
attending job interviews
and the fact that the exams
are shared with third year
students who start projects
almost immediately after-
wards.
Sam Wolfenden, the fourth
year aeronautics department
representative, told Felix:
“Let this be a lesson for
future years of the impor-
tance of forward planning, for
both the aeronautics depart-
ment and the College.
“The general consensus is
that we have been given a
highly stressful and unfair
task at a pivotal stage of our
degree, which could have
been avoided in the first
place at the cost of just a lit-
tle extra timetable planning
and thought.”
This is the last Felix of
term. The next issue is
published on Thursday
6 January 2005
