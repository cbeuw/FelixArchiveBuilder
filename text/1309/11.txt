It may have come to your
attention that most of the
recent articles which have
been submitted to Felix from
Silwood have revolved around
the consumption of alcohol.
This is indeed the case for
most universities. However,
one thing that must surely
be unique to us is rabbits.
Millions of them, everywhere.
Wye has its sheep, London
has red buses and Silwood
has more rabbits than a fox
could dream of. Beaten down
every year by outbreaks of
myxomatosis, they are always
keen to show their resilience
and bounce back by doing
what rabbits do best. As well
as our fluffy friends, it has
recently come to my atten-
tion that the woods of Silwood
Park are inhabited by another
well known mammal: the beer
monkey. I would like to share
with you my knowledge of this
creature.
It all started with the ‘beeri-
enteering’, one of the freshers
events we run here. Freshers
are given rather hastily drawn
maps of hidden beer in the
50 hectares of land we have
here. They’re then sent on
their way to find over 100 cans
of beer before merrily return-
ing to the bar many hours
later wet, covered in mud, and
attached to various fragments
of vegetation. This was swiftly
followed by the Silwood Beer
Festival. Both these events
were based around the con-
sumption of alcohol, and dur-
ing both, various members of
the Silwood community were
visited by the Silwood beer
monkey.
I believed the legend behind
the beer monkey was well
known, but I have been prov-
en wrong by the blank looks
spread across the faces of
those in the Silwood bar when
I put forward this theory.
Ever wondered why, when
you get home from a big night
out, you have literally no
money left over? The answer
is the beer monkey. It is highly
unlikely that you calculated
exactly how to spend your
money whilst at the bar in
that club or that your kebab
cost exactly what you had
left after you left the club.
The fact is that the beer mon-
key stole your loose change.
He can follow you home and
can choose to strike at the
moment your guard is let
down, from your neighbour’s
bush or from behind the lamp
post next to you. He will never
harm you, he will just leave
you perplexed as to how you
managed to spend all of your
money despite a vague rec-
ollection of visiting a cash
machine at some point during
the night.
Along with the beer mon-
key is the more commonly
known and experienced ‘beer
goggles’, a mind-altered state
experienced by both male and
females, leaving you wonder-
ing: “Oh no, did I?”
There is also the ‘beer jack-
et’, that warm invisible coat
that guards you from the cold
on your walk home after a
night out drinking, and the
‘beer scooter’ which safely
transports you from club to
home. This is why you cant
remember how you got home
the night before and is why
when asked the following
morning “where did you go to
last night?” rather than admit-
ting “er, I cant remember”, “I
got the beer scooter home” is
a more than adequate expla-
nation, ensuring that you got
home safely and had a good
night out.
