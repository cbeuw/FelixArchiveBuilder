EP REVIEW
Sometimes the best way to describe
any band is through comparisons.
Sometimes, though, pigeon-holing
does them an injustice. Such is the
situation with Four Day Hombre.
During the A&R frenzy following
the release of their Radio 1 approved
debut single The First Word Is The
Hardest, there were many compari-
sons made: Elbow, Muse, Haven,
Mogwai, Jeff Buckley, The Smiths...
the list goes on indefinitely. As you
can already see from that variety,
this old pigeon-holing business isn’t
as easy as it’s cracked up to be.
Lead track on this three song EP
,
Mr M, starts with piano and delicate
semi-falsetto vocals, creating some
dark atmospherics before the addi-
tion of some nifty slide-guitar. It
builds gradually, creating an amount
of tension before the chorus. Then
enter spine-tingling harmonies of
the man-screaming type. The song
ends in a cacophony of noise before
the brilliant addition of the lead
guitar’s lead being pulled out and
thrown on the floor. So it goes indie
intro, Muse-style chorus theatrics,
and ends in white noise. See the
problem?
Drink starts slowly, and sounds a
lot like Elbow. But then it explodes
into a big, bold, and loud chorus.
They manage to avoid the old post-
rock ‘quiet bit, loud bit’ formula by
bringing it back down for the end-
ing.
The Boy With The Mended Heart
begins with snare drums and upbeat
piano, again with very atmospheric,
delicate yet sky-scraping vocals. It
drops down to just piano and vocals
in a truly spine-tingling way to
finish.
A brilliant release from a band
trying to make it on their own (see
interview, below), may Four Day
Hombre continue to confuse music
journalists for years to come.

Four Day Hombre: talented and sadly overlooked
Life is cheese
Felix managed to catch up with Simon Wainwright, pin him to a chair
and ask him about Radio 1 airplay, their new self-run label, and cheese
INTERVIEW
Four Day Hombre isn’t these lads’
first band. They’ve had years of
being involved in bands “of varying
styles and success – from clubland
and beyond”, explains Simon.
“There’s a lot to be said for cut-
ting your teeth and learning your
trade in the working men’s clubs
of Lancashire and Yorkshire...gives
you a certain, erm, outlook. A cer-
tain appreciation.”
The core members met at
Lancaster University, “doing vari-
ous other musical activities”. Not
having any real music qualifications,
they formed a band “because we
desperately wanted to make great
music... it was the only avenue we
could explore. Ash (drums) was an
old mate of Ed’s (keyboards) and he
initially came down to just lay down
some loops. The rest, as they say, is
history”.
After spending a year or so out
in the unsigned wilderness, Four
Day Hombre emerged from their
basement studio with a incredible,
self-produced single. Simon talks
frankly about the aftermath: “When
we first got all the airplay on Radio 1
with The First Word Is The Hardest
our phone just went mad with every
A&R man, or A&R man’s monkey,
calling us up and saying they loved
us and could they have a full demo
and were we playing London and
would we like to meet up... It was
incredible and for a while it felt like
we ruled the world and all glory
would be ours... in a narcissistic kind
of way.”
In the end, though, the band turned
down the offers, worried about how
the future would pan out if they
did: “In the end we weren’t offered
a lot – we didn’t really fit any par-
ticular niche and couldn’t be associ-
ated with any bandwagon.” Simon
explains that they were seen as a
long shot by most of the labels, and
“major labels won’t back long shots
at the moment – the stakes are so
high, the chances of success so slim
and the budgets so offensively large
that unless you’re a sure-fire seller
or a photocopy of the latest big thing
then you don’t really stand much of a
chance.” It was a case of “not want-
ing to give up our creative freedom
– we were very independent, even
then.”
Setting up a record label was an
almost logical step from there: “Over
the last year we’ve released two
singles and had numerous record
contracts in our hands, and we’ve
become painfully aware that if you
want anything doing properly then
do it yourself.” Since they’d already
collected lots of creative people and
were “doing everything in-house
anyway – all the artwork, the web
stuff, the marketing” they decided
it was time to do it. “We thought we
might as well just make it official,
put on our waterwings and jump
in at the deep end. We’re all strong
swimmers.”
Though the label was set up pri-
marily as a way of releasing their
own records, there are plans to sign
more bands. Simon sees it as a
future direction for the label, not
for at least two years: “If we’re in a
position to get other bands record-
ing at that point then we’ll definitely
do it.”
He has a few sage words of advice
for young bands trying to get their
music heard: “Try again. Fail again.
Fail better. Keep playing, at all times
just keep playing.” He has high
hopes for the exposure potential of
the web: “Get something on the
internet. For better or worse, it is
the future.”
Four Day Hombre relied mainly
upon their own recording and pro-
ducing skills, as Simon explains.
“Take the plunge and invest in some
recording gear, no matter how basic.
It allowed us to develop our sound
and take away the pressure of one-
day recording sessions.” Wise words
indeed.
Lastly, asked to compare his
music to a Tesco Value product,
Simon chooses “cheese of a nota-
ble strength” before finishing with
the prophetic “life is cheese; ask
anyone.”
Sartre, eat your heart out.

SINGLE REVIEWS
The Chemical Brothers have
returned to their roots. This is basi-
cally musical language for “We’ve
run out of ideas and now we’re going
to nick stuff from our more success-
ful albums”.
However, the Chemicals have not
gone back to big beat but the inspi-
ration behind that genre. They’ve
gone back to their hip-hop roots,
even employing A Tribe Called
Quest’s Q-Tip (anyone remember
Can I Kick It?). The big bass is still
there but there is a distinct lack of
drive in this track.
The repetition of the line, “Don’t
hold back!” in the track does not
translateintothemusic,whereevery
part of this record feels predictable,
so much so that the climax doesn’t
feel that climactic. Everything just
happens and does not demand atten-
tion, nor is there the experimenta-
tion with sounds as with previous
efforts (including the fantastic Star
Guitar). All in all, this new single
from the Chemical Brothers is as
average as this review.
Matthew Hoban
No, no, no, no, no! If faced with
the prospect of having my testicles
removed by starved badgers or lis-
tening to this song more than once,
then I’m afraid the life of a eunuch
awaits me. They have really taken
the whole punk boy band thing to
a new level, a level where they just
become a boy band.
If you wanted to know what N*Sync
would sound like if they didn’t shave
for a couple of days and were beaten
with sacks full of coal as children,
then by all means indulge yourself
with this. Think of me as your sacri-
ficial lamb; I listen to this perversely
grotesque excuse for music so you
don’t have to. In fact, I deserve a cult
who worship me, judging from how
truly awful Good Charlotte are.
If they insist on making this kind
of faeces-smeared life-draining
’music’ then they should now be
called Bad Charlotte. Bad. So they
just wanna live, well then they
should give people a reason not to
kill them. Come on boys, good men
have died for less in fishing and
cooking accidents.
