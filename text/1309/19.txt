Christmas is coming, and its not just
the goose that is getting fat and has
people slobbering at the thought
of it.
With lectures out of the way there’s
no excuse for not making the most
of your nights out, and as Christmas
approaches the clubs are laying on
plenty of parties over the festive
season, climaxing with one of the
best, or at least most expensive and
most hyped nights in the clubbing
calendar, New Year’s Eve. Don’t just
take my word for it, though – have a
look around and see what’s on offer,
because there’s bound to be some-
thing that’ll appeal to you.
Christmas Parties
Christmas is a great time to get
out and about and experience some
nightlife, especially since you prob-
ably won’t have to get up in the
mornings! In the run-up to the end
of the year, there are plenty of spe-
cial events on offer:
Heat UK Xmas Curtain Raiser
Saturday 11 December
Koko

Turnmills
£12
Lottie, Jon Carter, Ashley Beedle
and Justin Robertson are back at

Fabric

Ratpack and many more all come
together to fill all three rooms of
giant Fabric with hoodies, caps and
the glorious sound of drum and
bass.
New Year’s Eve
New Year’s Eve is traditionally a
big one on the club scene. Whilst
there’s nothing better than being in
the middle of a rammed dancefloor
as Big Ben strikes, choose care-
fully (and quickly), as clubs charge
a hefty tariff for special nights, and
tickets sell out quickly.
Renaissance NYE
The Cross, York Way
Dave Seaman, Hybrid and Paul
Jackson headline a night for those
who like to make progress.
The End New Years Eve
£30-35
Layo & Bushwacka in the main room

Francis and DJ Vadim. Fabric regu-
lars galore at one of the biggest
clubs’ party.
Faith
The Egg, York Way
£25
A slightly more eclectic, less full-on
party but still one that promises to
deliver, with a line up featuring the
UnaBombers, Farley & Heller, and
Nancy Noise.

Rouge, 144 Charing Cross Road
£30
CJ Mackintosh, Jim Shaft Ryan.

join forces for crazy psychadelia.
Into the New Year

ably won’t be heading home to bed
with a cup of cocoa after all the
excitement at midnight, so why not
carry on into the new year?

Paul van Dyk less than perfect
DJ Paul van Dyk and club Gatecrasher are two of the biggest names around on the trance
scene, but did they cut it last Friday at Heaven?

CLUB REVIEW
On Friday 26 November, the colossal
juggernaut that is Gatecrasher rum-
bled its way into London’s Heaven,
and in the driving seat was the man
himself, variously known as God,
Your Majesty, or just plain Paul van
Dyk.
I’d been looking forward to it for
ages – the guys I met on the beach
in Ibiza were coming down from
Manchester, and in short, I was
thoroughly overexcited.
Back in March of this year, club-
land was looking distinctly wobbly.
Trance had been flat on its back
for the whole of last year, and I’d
started to think maybe I’d grown
out of dance music. It was going to
be a wrench, but bear in mind I’m
27, and the time is going to come for
all of us. Anyway, I went to this exact
same event in the exact same venue
back in March, and Paul van Dyk
was so frantically awesome, I joy-
fully ditched the idea of retirement
and here I still am today.
So, I was expecting great things
from Friday, and indeed there’s
nothing quite like arriving at Heaven
to bring you to an absolute pitch of
feverish excitement – the sweep of
the road down the side of the sta-
tion, the steps down to the tunnel,
the orange glow of the lights, queues
of that unmistakable breed – club-
bers, in their sexy trousers with zips
up the side and trainers and funky
t-shirts, clutching their tickets in
hot little hands, the bouncers, the
metal detectors, and overall, that
deep bass thump that you can hear
and feel in the pit of your stomach.
Oooh... clubbing anyone?
Nick Riley warmed up for PvD,
and played a surprisingly low-paced
set – sort of a proggy deep house
rather than trance. Still, he played
some ace tracks – Tilt’s The World
Doesn’t Know, and the brilliantly
urgent Jump The Next Train by
Young Parisians.
And then, the time had come –
1am, the start of PvD’s set, and
that undeniably emotional, glorious
sound. I crept forward to the front
to make sure it was him, and there’s
an undeniable thrill in seeing that
deadpan face that’s looked out at
you from so many record sleeves
and CD cases. It was less of an
uplifting and euphoric set than I
would have expected – more uncom-
promising, with a definite tech influ-
ence, but nothing wrong with that.
There were plenty of big tunes as
well, like Sander van Doorn’s Dark
Roast, and many, many of his own
– For An Angel, Wir Sind Wir, Time
Of Our Lives, and Crush – and this
is kind of when the trouble started.
I recognised almost everything I
heard him play, and I didn’t hear
anything I didn’t know that I des-
perately wanted to find out about.
He played Space Brothers’ One
More Chance, for heaven’s sake,
which is positively ancient and, I’m
sad to say, in my opinion a tiny bit
cheesy. Paul just seemed to have
given himself a bit of an easy ride. I
still love the man to bits but it really
won’t do. I don’t know, perhaps he
was ill, or having a bad day, but if
you’re performing, you’re going to
be judged. I even wondered cyni-
cally if Nick Riley had deliberately
(or been instructed to) played at a
slower pace to make it easier for
PvD. Towards the end there was a
bit of the old magic. He finished off
his set with a mix of Jump The Next
Train, nice and acoustic through the
vocals and then off like an express
train, with everyone leaping about
like lunatics.
I have to say the place did look
extremely nice though – a big
sparkly silver Gatecrasher lion up
on the wall and a huge, enthusiastic
crowd. What makes it such a shame
is that PvD and Gatecrasher do
have this colossal number of loyal
followers that will hand over their
hard-earned 15 quid (or £22 on the
door) and come anyway. Surely they
deserve better. It’s sad to rely on the
old faces and brand recognition.
Let’s hope that the great man
was simply having an off day and
we can put this behind us. I’ll still
definitely go next time and I’ll be
as excited as I was this time. On
a brighter note, the next couple of
months are looking to continue the
run of quality events that we’ve been
spoiled with this year: Lange, Smith
& Pledger and Simon Patterson at
TranceGeneration, Matt Darey’s
DecadealbumlaunchatDecember’s
Knowwhere, Massive @ Heaven,
Lashed, and brand new trance night
Ultra Utopia in January. No sleep
for a while then.
