Welcome to the final week
of Felix Science in 2004. This
week we feature a host of arti-
cle on themes varying from
ChronicObstructivePulomery
Disease (COPD) to one of the
latest Imperial College inno-
vations to hit the news, the
MODS disc.
We start off, however, with
the build-up to the Huygens
landing which we’re all hoping
will be successful in 2005. I am
absolutely fascinated by all
this. Titan is the largest moon
in the solar system but it has
always been shrouded in mys-
tery due to its dense atmos-
phere. Although it is highly
unlikely, there have been sug-
gestions that some sort of life
could have possibly evolved on
its surface. The latest images,
however, have already been a
revelation.
David Osumi-Sutherland’s
article looks at what the scien-
tists have already discovered
and what they are looking for
on Titan. He also looks at the
potential pitfalls of the mis-
sion. Felix Science will contin-
ue to cover Huygens’ progress
in the New Year.
Also this week, Elena
Lengthorn takes a brave step
and defends wind energy.
As European countries get
greener and greener, shouldn’t
Britain be following the pat-
tern set by our continental
counterparts? As the article
explains, times have changed
and wind energy has devel-
oped a strong case for itself.
Amadeus Stevenson contin-
ues his epic journey through
the perils of day-to-day tech-
nology (having already cov-
ered hacking, cracking,
adware, and spyware), and
this week reviews the operat-
ing systems on offer nowadays
– no, you are not restricted to
using Windows (in fact, I hap-
pen to be working on a Mac
right now).

exclusive with his coverage of
the NHS’s plans to address
COPD by using information
from weather forecasts.
Finally, Anushri Patel inter-
views the man behind the
MODS, Dr. Peter Torök, and
demystifies some of the stories
that have been going around
in the media about the new
one terabyte disc developed
at Imperial College’s physics
department.
So finally I’d like to take this
opportunity to thank some
of the people who have been
working on the section this
term. Thanks particularly to
the editor, Dave Edwards,
whose professionalism and
encouragement have helped
push the science section
foward, as well as the paper
as a whole.
Respect also goes to:
Emma Williams (biochemis-
try), Andya Primanda (NHM
and biological sciences), Tom
Simonite (science commu-
nication), Rosie Taylor (sci.
comm.), William Gates (bio-
engineering), Iain Taylor (sci.
comm.),AlexAntonov(maths),
Amadeus Stevenson (phys-
ics), Anushri Patel (physics),
James Berry (biochemistry),
Kate Wighton (sci comm) and
Giovanna Larice (biochemis-
try), as well as all the other
contributers who have written
for the science section.
To all the readers: happy
Christmas and an enjoyable
new year.

MODS, media and misinterpretations
The Imperial physics department is patenting a revolutionary data storage technology.
Anushri Patel met the head of the research team, Dr Peter Török, to find out more
The new MODS – Multiplexed
Optical Data Storage – discs
could potentially store up to
one terabyte of data each.
Although not yet mastered,
the team have ‘demonstrated
what can be done’. To achieve
the maximum storage capac-
ity, the MODS discs will be
double sided and dual lay-
ered, and instead of storing
one bit per pit like conven-
tional CDs and DVDs, MODS
discs can store eight bits due
to the asymmetrical nature of
the pits.
Dr Peter Török will be
attending a meeting later on
this year to find out if the
discs are viable for mass
manufacture, and is confident
that their fabrication will be
easy and cheap. Research
and funding permitting, Dr
Török estimates that the discs
will be available on the mar-
ket within five to ten years.
Although he emphasised
that “there have been a lot of
misinterpretations and mis-
understandings” surround-
ing the new discs, and this
timescale is “largely affected
by political and financial fac-
tors as well as technological
factors”, a fact missed out by
a large majority of articles
covering this technology.
The BluRay disc, although
technically sound, has had its
date of release pushed back
due to these reasons. Before a
new data disc comes into the
market, a universal standard
must be agreed by the com-
panies which will produce it,
which can take a great deal of
time. The BluRay consortium
was set up for this very pur-
pose, to establish a univer-
sal standard for the BluRay
media. The other factor is
that the companies will want
to make as much money as
they can out of previous tech-
nologies before they render
them obsolete and embrace
new ones. This can be seen by
the fact that only now is VHS
being withdrawn from sale,
and DVDs are being given
greater emphasis. BluRay
can only come out once
the companies have made
enough money from the sale
of DVDs, or they are forced
to market their product by
the competition, and conse-
quently MODS discs will most
likely be able to come on to
the market once the compa-
nies have milked all they can
from BluRay.
Once it has been estab-
lished whether it is techno-
logically and financially pos-
sible to mass-produce MODS
discs and share data, the
team hope to further research
whether a writing/rewriting
facility can be made available.
Dr Török mentioned that they
do have the capacity to reach
that status, but again it is
heavily dependent on further
funding.
30-year data storage pio-
neer Michael Thomas, owner
of Colossal Storage, believes
that the concept will fail
because the design is prone
to complex errors, and that
it may just be better to con-
tinue to store large amounts
of data on a hard drive, but
Dr Török believes that this
is only partially true. Any
data system relying on fitting
a large amount of data in a
smaller space will always be
prone to error for a number of
reasons, even when compar-
ing DVD and CD discs. The
same thickness of scratch on
a DVD takes out many more
bits of data than on a CD, and
this effect is even greater for
MODS discs, especially as the
wavelength of light involved
is significantly smaller
(around 405nm). This does
not mean, however, that the
whole technology can be
dismissed and in actual fact
the BluRay disc is likely to
be similarly scratch sensi-
tive. Hard drives are in fact
far more delicate than discs,
hence having to keep them
contained. The advantage of
MODS discs when it comes
to data protection is that a
large number of discs can
be produced for low cost, so
duplicate copies will be easy
to produce.
Dr Török emphasised that
whilst you could fit a large
amount of data on one disc,
for example a few series of
The Simpsons, it may not
necessarily reduce the cost
of the MODS on the market.
Whilst they are still cheap to
produce, movies and music
will still be subject to addi-
tional charges. “You don’t buy
the disc [in that case], you
support the large number of
people behind the produc-
tion”, so all episodes of a TV
series on one MODS disc will
cost no less than a box set of
DVDs, but there will be the
added convenience of having
everything on one disc and
saving valuable space on the
shelf.
He also stressed that the
project is very much col-
laborative, with a number of
people significantly involved,
including his PhD student,
Mr Peter Munro. The other
members of the team are Dr
Martin Salt, Professor Hans
Peter Herzig and Mr Carsten
Rockstuhl from the University
of Neuchatel in Switzerland
and Emmanouil Kriezis
from Aristotle University of
Thessaloniki in Greece.
The team have applied for
funding to EPSRC and are
currently in the process of
writing a European grant
application to fund their
research further. The latter
one is a collaboration between
the Imperial physics and elec-
trical engineering (led by Dr
Eric Yeatman) departments,
the Technical University
of Delft, the University of
Neuchatel and Aristotle
University. Dr Török has also
set up a website to reveal the
facts behind popular claims,
as well as further details
behind the new technology.
