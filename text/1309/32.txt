Imperial 2nd 42
St George’s 2nd 10
By Celina Rughani
Once again, the Imperial
Seconds, also known as
‘The Fairies’, have demon-
strated their magic. They won
not one but two matches in a
row. With a flick of their wand,
a sprinkle of some fairy dust
and a damn fantastic team,
the Seconds held down their
high standards and arse-
whooping antics!
Both matches were against
St George’s. The first was
won by an outstanding score
of 39-17, but the latest match
confirmed that the Fairies
are a force to be reckoned
with, winning 42-10.
Aiming to maintain their
unbeaten record, The Fairies
pulled together to show great
skill and the determination
to win. Besides the blistering
cold and a few accidents that
called for the first aid box, the
matches were smooth and to
their favour throughout.
With the arrival of a new
uniform, not only did we kick
arse, but we looked hot, the
skirts putting a new definition
to mini!
Overall a great perform-
ance by The Fairies and the
most positive we’ve been all
term! And to all our support-
ers out there: “Fairy love to
you all,” as Hen would say!
Fairies show magical skills
