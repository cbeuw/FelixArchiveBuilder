Super-Mega-Ultimate Xmas Lyric Quiz, or to be
catchy, SMUXLQ. We’ve took key lines from 31 of the
best Christmas songs around. Some are pop songs,
some are carols; some are worth listening to, others
are turgid crap. There’s a point for each song title that
you correctly guess. And if you just Google them, we’ll
know.

undercover but you tore me apart

Merry
Christmas
and a Happy
New Year
from the
Coffee Break
team!
I would like to introduce a new sec-
tion to Coffee Break, ‘fitty of the
week’, so here is our first bit of
totty.
I’m sure you have all noticed him
walking around the College. Who
could miss those baby blue eyes,
and newly bleached blonde hair. Yes
eveyone, this weeks hotty is Michael
Higns. Now there are no points in
this section I’m afraid, it’s for pure
enjoyment only, and I just want to
add: don’t be angry bread.
I would like to dedicate a bit of time
to talking about Michael so you can
all see what an amazing person he is
and why I have chosen him for fitty
of the week. Michael enjoys horse
riding, but above all his favourite
hobby is computer games, which he
usually plays until the early morn-
ing. He’s also a member of the TA,
so we are expecting a bit of a fit body
under that jumper! He’s a second
year physics undergraduate, and his
favourite club is Breakin’ Bread. If
we have any takers, email coffee.
felix@ic.ac.uk and I’m sure we can
sort you out with a date.
