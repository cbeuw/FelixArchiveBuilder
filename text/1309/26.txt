Imagine the scene. Agitated figures
scurry around aimlessly through
an intricate maze of Victorian and
Brutalist architecture. Meanwhile,
a meek middle-aged suit with a
big interest in biotechnology peers
down from the top of an anachro-
nistic monolith provided by a set of
mysterious benefactors. And down
below a group of renegade physi-
cists are plotting their next strike
against the system. Sound famil-
iar? It will do, once you’ve played
through the long-awaited awaited
sequel to 1998’s game of the year!
Yes, Half Life 2 has finally become
a reality, after last year’s great con-
troversy surrounding the leak of
files by a German hacker.
Exactly six years ago, the world
woke up to the sound of a crowbar
meeting flesh, and now ex-Microsoft
employees Valve Software, or
to be precise, the strange entity
known widely as the G-man, has
brought Gordon Freeman back to
a leaner, meaner world. Those who
have already played through City
17 will know that Valve have taken
no chances with piracy, infuriating
some users by forcing them to wait
several hours before the game could
be authenticated by Steam, Valve’s
own built-in software. This Windows
XP style system is seen by some as
a shift to the future in games like
HL2’s DVD-only retail release, forc-
ing those who hadn’t to go out and
buy DVD drives.
So, to those who haven’t bought
Half Life 2, a word of advice. Do. The
original game came out at a time
when people were bitching between
Quake II and Unreal. It managed to
blow away both of them, and even
though the actual multiplayer com-
ponent was largely forgotten, the
support that Valve gave to budding
developers helped produce mods
like Counterstrike, which arguably
became more famous than Half Life
itself. Furthermore, Half Life was
revolutionary in its scope and Marc
Laidlaw’s B-movie plot certainly
makes it all the more memorable
now, which is why the makers have
expanded Dr Freeman’s journey
into a whole universe... or two!
The game begins as the first one
ended, on a train. But this is a very
different kettle of fish to the Black
Mesa research facility. City 17 is
a fictional eastern European city,
under the control of a mysterious
force called the Combine that has
ruled earth since the seven hour
war. You soon find out that everyone
has heard of your name, and you
are now revered by your allies and
feared by your enemies. But that
doesn’t stop them from trying to
kill you! And so the carnage begins.
Whereas there has been a growth
in role-playing shooters like Deus
Ex in the time since Nihilanth was
defeated, Half Life 2 encourages a
less stealthy approach than its pred-
ecessor, and instead we are now
confronted by horde upon horde of
zombies, cyborgs, ant-lions and fly-
ing buzz-saws!
Just as this epic is building on
years of gaming greatness, it plays
like a truly interactive movie through
fantastic backdrops. It takes you
from the sordid ghettos and canal
chases of City 17, to zombie flicks
in Ravenholm, to post-apocalyptic
thrillers and creature features along
highway 17, to Normandy beaches
and prison dramas in Nova Prospekt,
back to urban warfare and finally
into the evil citadel itself, where it’s
as if the Borg assimilated the Earth
of 2199 with the Death Star!
With all this evil trying to put an
end to Gordon again, it’s refreshing
that there is now an array of friendly
characters there to help you along,
including the crazy Father Grigory,
who bestows you with the Zero-
point energy device, also known as
the manipulator or gravity-gun. The
fun that can be had with this tool is
limited only by your imagination, as
it lets you pick up and launch large
objects around the place, thanks to
the otherwise ultra-realistic phys-
ics courtesy of the Havok engine.
The other weapons in your stand-
ard arsenal haven’t changed greatly
from the first game, although they
are better than ever.
People who want an intellectu-
al challenge will be disappointed
as HL2 pays homage to the glory
days of arcade gaming, delivering
extremely addictive gameplay in
gorgeous realism that requires the
intelligence of a Headcrab rather
than the PhD that Gordon never has
a chance to put to use. The game’s
linearity allows for some beautifully
choreographed set-pieces while
never disembodying the player from
the ever-mute Free-Man.
The makers have remembered
that game-play shouldn’t be blinded
by shiny graphics or drowned by
immersion into an overly compli-
cated environment as they have
strived to uphold the players’ right
to have fun. In effect, the game’s
adherence to primitive narration
and a rich narrative create all the
suspense that is needed to drag
the player through the game and to
the conclusion that HL3 is all but a
formality.
As a final note, Half Life 2 is avail-
able either in the shops or through
Steam as several different pack-
ages. Counterstrike Source, ren-
dered as HL2, comes as standard
whilst Half Life Source, the original
game re-mastered plus a whole load
of extra bumf, is available for extra
through Steam. An X-Box release
is planned for next spring, giving
the game a wider audience through
the console market, although the
PC version has been on monitor
screens since November 16 and will
probably be so in various forms for
a long time to come!

“Horde upon horde

It’s time to run for your life. STRIIIIIIIIIIDER!!!
Teams, players, egos... the entire game on your PC
Having played every version of the
popular PC game Championship
Manager, I was weary when the fol-
low-up to last year’s primary cause
of missed lectures and near exam
failure was announced.
With a new name, Football
Manager 2005, the series formerly
known as Championship Manager
was to be avoided at all costs. Yet
after receiving a review copy of the
game, I relented. And since then,
I haven’t stopped. Or gone to lec-
tures.
For those of you with lives, igno-
rant of this plague on the country’s
menfolk, FM 2005 is surprisingly
enough a football management sim-
ulation, allowing you to take control
of your choice of over 5000 teams
from over 50 countries. There are no
fancy graphics, just more statistics
than a John Motson wet dream. As
a result, anyone who reckons they
could do better than José Mourinho
(at winning, not being a smug bas-
tard) will become instantly addicted,
ruining relationships and careers
and, quite possibly, threatening glo-
bal security.
Having only a week to review the
game (including lectures) and fan-
cying more fun than losing every
week as manager of Wycombe
Wanderers, I plumped for the choice
of controlling Chelsea. As my man-
agerial alter-ego Jeremy Beadle
worked his way through a season
of Premiership football, I slipped
further and further into the depths
of addiction. My usual routine was to
eschew food and sunlight in favour
of sitting in front of the computer for
hours on end. Whilst my team were
busy eking out poor results and I
was becoming less popular with the
fans, I contented myself with finding
humour in the game’s little quirks.
For instance, using the new media
interaction feature, you can inform
the media of your opinions on other
managers and teams, thus starting
mind games à la Sir Alex Ferguson.
Whilst being an innovative addi-
tion to the game, it also throws
up some oddities – my housemates
and I were amused to read the lit-
any of homoerotic correspondence
between Beadle and Birmingham
City manager Steve Bruce, each tak-
ing turns to compliment the other in
what seemed to be a blossoming
relationship.
For non-football lovers, FM 2005
probably represents the nadir of
gaming pleasure, an endless display
of useless statistics across a muted,
Spartan background. But for fans of
this series, and anyone with a love
of football, the lure of taking over
one of the many teams from the
colossal database is too attractive.
As is the prospect of unearthing
such gems as my personal favourite,
the spectacularly-named TJ Mclory-
Cuthbertson.
With quicker loading times and
extra detail, FM 2005 is certainly
another giant leap in the evolution
of the series. But for God’s sake, if
you want to come out of university
with a degree, steer well clear of
this game...

It doesn’t look like much, but it’s what footie geeks always dreamed of
“More statistics than
a John Motson wet
dream”
“My usual routine
