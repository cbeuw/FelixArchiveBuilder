ALBUM REVIEWS
Stars are yet another band to come
out of the eclectic Canadian collec-
tive that spawned KC Accidental,
Broken Social Scene and Metric, the
basic premise being that loads of
art-school musicians (Do Say Make
Think members, for example) get
together in random little groups
and make deliberately different
music from their ‘home’ bands.
When these beard-stroking, arch
post-rock kids go pop, the results
are astonishing.
Stars is based around the “he said,
she said” vocal interplay of the fan-
tastically named Torquil Campbell
and Amy Millan. You can consider
them the most pop end of the col-
lective; there’s precious little in the
way of wigouts, krautrock clicks or
any of that crap. They aim to take
over the genre founded by later
Pavement and Stephen Malkmus
– the wry, witty pop song, mixing
experimentation with clever lyrics
and hook-laden choruses.
Opener Your Ex-Lover Is Dead is
a tounge-in-cheek, heart-in-mouth
description of the end of a relation-
ship, set against horns and Death
Cab-esque guitar lines. The whole
thing has a vague resemblance to
FairyTaleOfNewYork;itcatalogues
love gone sour in the same offbeat
way. In fact, the whole record is
about relationships being destroyed,
falling apart, or reminisced over.
Check out The Big Fight; gentle
Rhodes piano and a slow, gentle
jazz feel allow Torquil and Amy’s
call-and-response vocals about the
mundane facts of a breakup room
to breathe: “There are bills here for
you / that’s cos nothing is free.”
Ageless Beauty is a wall of guitar
noise, reminiscent of Broken Social
Scene’s Almost Crimes, which
progresses slowly and predictably,
Amy’s soft, schoolgirl-esque vocals
floating ethereally over the top,
before a surprising, offbeat flurry of
hypermelodic guitar noise signals
the huge chorus to come crashing
in while she joyfully proclaimes “We
will always be alive!” A My Bloody
Valentine homage it may be, but its
a damn good one.
What I’m Trying To Say comes
across like the Postal Service aping
Superchunk; bleepy keyboards and
syncopated basslines track a bit-
tersweet tale of love and heavy drug
use with yet another killer chorus:
“I am trying to say / what I’m trying
to say / without having to say / I love
you”. Cheesy is never far away when
you’re trying to chronicle romantic
entanglements, but the clever wit
and dead-on observations will make
you laugh (or cry) it off.
Special mention must go to The
First Five Times for being the best
song ever about the first five times
you have sex with someone – it’s
achingly true, heartrendingly funny
and just plain genius. A bouncy
acoustic riff drives Torquil through
his reminiscing, before a buzzing
bassline and heavy drums take us
to a much darker place: “And every
day / it’s changed since then”, sing
Amy and Torquil together in glori-
ously sad harmonies.
I could talk for hours about how
great this album is. Every song is
a small slice of pop perfection in its
own right; witness swelling horns
and soft organs on Sleep Tonight,
driving, bouncy basslines and eight-
ies synths on the hopelessly upbeat
paen to love Set Yourself On Fire,
or the rush of Pavement guitars
that precedes an ode to longlost
schooldays and Friend’s Reunited-
style meetings, Reunion. “I had six
too many drinks last night, yes /
that’s why I made you stay” sings
Torquil, like it’s the most romantic
sentiment ever.
You need to hear this record.
Seriously. It’s moving, at turns
both funny and bleak, and it’s full
of more great melodies and clever
lyrics than most bands manage in
an entire career. You owe it to your
ears, your heart, and that little gooey
bit in your brain that loves great pop
music.

Jim Morrison’s back! Well, he isn’t
actually, but from looking at the
front cover art for the ex-Westlife
star’s latest album you can tell
that’s the look he’s going for, as the
rugged former boy band charmer
now makes his attempt at a credible,
‘grown up’ record. But coming from
a safe, chart-friendly musical back-
ground, you know he’s not going
to push the boundaries too far, and
he’s definitely not going to call him-
self the new lizard king, take loads
of drugs and run around naked
onstage, unlike the aforementioned
Doors front man.
Or will he? Songs like Demons and
He’s No Hero, with its lyrics of doom
and alcoholism (sample: “Have you
ever, been lost in a different world
/ where everything you have known
/ has gone…”), it gives the impres-
sion that the squeaky-clean image
of Westlife hides a history of misuse
and depression. Well it would do,
if the actual musical compositions
included in it weren’t so dull and
conservative.
Yes, it’s his new ‘mature’ album;
however it mainly stays safe with
slow, meandering musical compo-
sitions: music that makes Keane
sound like the Kinks. The overall
songwriting is uninspired as well,
which is not surprising as he co-
wrote the album with Robbie
William’s ex-songwriter. All songs
fall into one of two categories: the
happy songs about love, or the sad
songs about love. And with each
one having a nice slop of schmaltz
applied to it, you’ve a recipe for
a whole album consisting of dull,
unmemorable songs, with a few that
are recognisable purely for being
excessively bad – Sorry, Love Daddy
being a prime example, a real heart
wrencher written as a goodbye note
from a father who decides to do
a runner. Except it wrenches the
funny bone rather then the heart
(and if someone I knew decided to
write his goodbye like that, I’d be
glad he’s gone).
There are a few reasonably inter-
esting songs on here though – the
opener, Irish Son, is a surprisingly
articulate tune about the strict reli-
gious upbringing in his home coun-
try, if let down by the cheesiness
of the tune. Same with Lose – Lose
Situation, although it’s back to love
again, mind (and – gasp – he even
swears a bit!). Walking Disaster is
also a decent energetic little tune,
taking its inspiration from recent
bands like Snow Patrol.
But that’s it, and the rest is just
the same boring dirge, albeit a bet-
ter set of dirge then what was pro-
duce with Westlife. I would only rec-
ommend buying this as a Christmas
present for that older relatives who
thinks Dido offers enough excite-
ment in music today.

Stars delight, Brian disappoints
The eclectic Canadians’ third album is a fantastic example of what pop should be, whereas
Brian “I used to be in Westlife” McFadden’s solo attempt is somewhat poor

SINGLE REVIEW
Listening to this gets one in touch
with one’s primal urges. I had to
restrain myself from shaking loose
and getting in touch with my inner
ape whilst screaming out, “RAWK!”
Darker, edgier and yet more
melodic than anything on Youth And
Young Manhood, this also manages
to take over your life in its “what
just happened there?” two minutes
and ten seconds. Yes! Only two
minutes ten seconds; that’s how long
the Mars Volta take to tune up. It
follows the formula of The Bucket
with its driving verse and then
half speed broken down chorus.
However, who cares about originali-
ty when a riff this good pounds away
with all its garage rock scratchy
excellence?
After repeated listens I still have
no idea what Caleb is singing about.
The chorus goes something like,
“You whipped, you switch play pie-
sale, I get my guns from south, who
take to the yard like a cock fight, for
kids who’s strutting now?” If anyone
has any idea what this means, then
please send your answer on a post-
card to: Couldn’t Care Less With A
Riff This Good, London, England.
For all the incomprehensible lyr-
ics, I guarantee that you will be
shouting along about whipping your
tackle out at a pie-sale (I will not
be held responsible for any mental
damage this may incur) by the third
listen. Oh, and did I mention how
good the riff is?
