Latest from the Square Mile
From Ukraine to the heart of London, Numaan Chaudhry has it covered
Viktor vetoed
Tens of thousands of
Ukrainians rejoiced at
the overruling decision by
Ukraine’s supreme court last
Friday to dismiss last week’s
elections.
Instead, the court declared
December 26 the date for the
re-vote, thus putting Viktor
Yanukovych, who will from
hereon be referred to as
Yank, and Viktor Yushchenko,
who will be referred to as
Yush, back into the ring for
the presidency.
Yush hailed the court’s rul-
ing as a triumph over Yank’s
attempt to crush democratic
power by rigging the elec-
tions. The previous president,
Leonid Kuchma, was intent
on restarting the entire
election from scratch in an
attempt to bring someone
into the contest alongside
Yush and Yank.
Vladimir Putin, the billion-
aire Russian prime minister,
offerednoreactiontothenews
as he hid his fury behind a veil
of adjectives aimed implicitly
at the US, the driving force
behind the re-elections. Putin
had backed Yank from the
start of his campaign and the
judgment was seen as a blow
to their mutual relationship.
Dollar makes U-turn
Last week saw the dollar slip
to a meagre 1.34 against the
euro, 101.9 against the yen
and a 1.94 against the pound
sterling. The fact that crude
oil prices have dropped to
$44 from their record high of
$55 in September was a cru-
cial factor in uplifting the US
trade deficit and hence the
dollar currency.
Although there’s no rea-
son to believe that this drop
should continue, since OPEC
is trying frantically to slow
supplies and build invento-
ries, oil’s volatility could dic-
tate otherwise.
The zloty also looked strong-
er than ever. Despite sound-
ing like a south Australian
kangaroo, the Polish cur-
rency actually hopped to a
new high of 4.16 against the
euro. Polish prime minister
Marek Belka last week raised
doubts about the zloty’s abil-
ity to sustain its levels.
TfL – Red Alert
Brace yourselves (no pun
intended) for Transport for
London’s (TfL) latest initia-
tive. A £200m new bond issue
is to be sold in a bid to improve
our capital’s transport infra-
structure. The bond, due to
mature in 2034, will be sold at
a spread of 0.5 over UK gilts,
the standard priced govern-
ment bond.
The 0.5 spread has been
criticised as low, considering
the double-A rating carried
by TfL and the relatively poor
infrastructure of the trans-
port network.
CSFB eliminates
‘duplicates’
Credit Suisse First Boston,
the subsidiary of Swedish
giant Credit Suisse, out-
lined plans earlier this week
to remove certain divisions
within its global operation in
order to harness its growing
losses. Among these, equity
research and securities
origination are notorious for
reproducing work of the same
nature.
Equity research consists of
a bunch of specialists, nor-
mally in an industry sector,
region or product group, who
advise potential clients on
which equities, or shares, to
invest in.
Securities origination gurus
structure securities, a form
of collateral, and try to win
over business by proving the
advantage of their structured
products over the competi-
tors.
Clearly, CSFB has two
options: get rid of one unit or
combine them. It goes without
saying that if you’re applying
to either of these areas for
an internship (it’s now too
late for full time), you should
reconsider your options.
“I’m a multi-tied
independent adviser”
This is the statement many
thousands of financial prod-
ucts specialists will be
forced to rant daily after new
rules were introduced on
Wednesday last week.
The new legislation
demands that distributors of
special services, including
unit trusts and pensions, will
need to declare themselves
as free from any outside pres-
sures and be knowledgeable
in all of the various types of
public and private investment
categories. This ‘depolarisa-
tion’ from any specific type of
service should give the cus-
tomer a better selection of
products to choose from.
You can do it...
If you put your back into
it! Ice Cube’s response to
Gordon Brown’s pre-budget
report sums up my feelings
exactly. By ‘putting your back
into it’, you could be entitled
up to nine months off work,
according to Brown’s plans
to increase paid maternity
leave.
Although this will form reg-
ulation at the beginning of
next year, small businesses
are already starting to grum-
ble at the anticipated time
and money lost through the
scheme. To make things
worse, or better as the case
may be, children at the age
of seven will receive an addi-
tional £250 funding by the
government, on top of the
£250 given to newborns. If
that’s not enough to get you
moving, £1720 is up for grabs
when claiming child tax cred-
it, for those whose income
falls short of £13,000.
Christmas boom
expected
The Santa Claus rally is the
term coined for the tradition-
al rise of stocks across the
board. Ask any expert and
they’ll tell you that Christmas
is the best time for invest-
ing. I concur. From an influx
of retirement money to pen-
sion managers trying to boost
their performance, all con-
tribute to rising stock prices.
If you haven’t got the mes-
sage... invest now!
Lazard IPO delayed
Lazard, one of the most pres-
tigious, renowned and amaz-
ing (you can tell I love these
guys) advisory services, has
extended the ultimatum
to Bruce Wasserstein as to
when the firm is to go public.
The IPO, which would value
this beautiful organisation
at $1.6bn, would raise suffi-
cient funds to extend its glo-
bal reach and compete with
the likes of Morgan Stanley,
Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and
JPMorgan.
Fishy findings
The Government made
another blunder earlier this
week by contradicting itself
on its advice on fish consump-
tion.
Apparently, because of the
volume of fish consumed
in the UK, depleting fish-
ing grounds are becoming
more common and we should
reduce our intake to less than
two portions a week. But
Government health officials
stated that we should eat at
least two portions a week.
Luckily, nothing was said
about burger consumption,
so this affects none of us.
Chaudhry’s ratings
I foresee GlaxoSmithKline
Beecham, who are anticipat-
ing approval for a new drug
with the FDA, to jump in
stock price. The drug sup-
posedly eases intestinal pres-
sure by preventing some fat
getting absorbed in the blood
stream.
