Wind energy – these seem
to be dirty words at the
moment! There has been so
much press about the inad-
equacies of wind energy as
a power supply that a gen-
eral feeling of negativity and
doubt has descended over
this renewable option.
It is fairly easy to jump
on the ‘wind = bad’ band
wagon, what with turbines
reaching 260 feet into the sky
and being erected in tranquil
rural settings. David Thomas
of the Mail on Sunday sug-
gests that townies (the likes
of Imperial dwellers) should
quit diverting our environ-
mental guilt into schemes
that the rural communities
are being made to suffer. Mr
Thomas suggests that there
is no evidence that wind
farms have any real benefits.
Here I have to disagree,
and argue that the concern
should be with lack of take-up.
Townies’ schemes are taking
place in the countryside as
that is where there is space
available. I’m positive that
few in the city would mind
having a turbine attached to
the roof of their office block
or home if that were pos-
sible!
In 1991, the US Department
of Energy published a
National Wind Resource
Inventory in which it point-
ed out that between them,
Kansas, North Dakota and
Texas have enough harness-
able wind power to serve the
national electricity require-
ments. This detail was writ-
ten over a decade ago, when
turbines were a meagre 120
feet. The modern, taller, tur-
bines operate at lower speeds
more efficiently and are able
to harness more reliable and
larger wind regimes at high-
er levels.
Europe is the wind energy
world leader, but the UK still
seems reluctant to embrace
its potential. Last year, the
European Wind Energy
Association projected that by
2020 half the population of
Western Europe’s electric-
ity would be provide by wind
energy. If the offshore poten-
tial was utilised, it could
provide all of the region’s
residential electricity by the
same time according to a 2004
assessment by the Gerrad
Hassan consulting group.
The cost of wind-generated
electricity has fallen with the
kilowatt hour cost to its low-
est ever, down by a factor of
ten to 3¢ on some long supply
US contracts. So wind power
is now cheap, widely avail-
able, clean and in abundance
– and the weakness of irregu-
larity is being overcome by
using taller turbines and uti-
lising the National grid.
Gas-electric hybrid cars,
such as the Toyota Prius,
could also exploit wind
resources. They drive 55
miles to the gallon and Lester
Brown of the Earth Policy
Institute in Washington sug-
gests that adding a second
battery and a plug-in capac-
ity could increase their elec-
tricity storage ability. This
would further reduce their
gas intake another 20%, giv-
ing an overall cutback of 70%.
The plug-in hybrids could
become part of the storage
system for wind energy.
There are still, according
to Peter Odell, Professor
Emeritus at Erasmus
University Rotterdam,
enough oil reserves remain-
ing to be exploited to meet
current demand for another
40 years. Some of the exploi-
tation methods will have to
change, but these are tech-
nologically possible. Demand
for energy is going to con-
tinue to rise steadily as it has
been at 2% per year for the
last 30 years – and after all
the oil has been exploited,
carbon could still be king
with coal and then natural
gas to dominate the global
energy picture.
For wind to rule, the
Government and policy-mak-
ers worldwide must show
even more commitment to
the principle of renewable
energy, raise taxes on carbon
fuels and subsidise the devel-
opment of alternative power
harnessing.
My biased townie view is
that is would be best to make
wind king, the sooner the bet-
ter all round.
Surely wind energy is the perfect solution
Wind farming: the cost has fallen to its lowest ever
Different operating systems, different needs
By Amadeus Stevenson
Physics department
When you buy a compu-
ter, chances are it’s a PC,
or to put it simply, it’s run-
ning Microsoft Windows. You
might even think that the def-
inition of a home computer
is a thing with a “Start” but-
ton that crashes during your
lab report write-up. However,
there’s a lot more out there in
computer never-never-land.
As we’ve seen in previous
articles, the operating system
on a computer is the software
(written in a programming
language as source code)
which interfaces between
you, the user, and the elec-
tronic hardware inside your
computer. You want to play
Cher’s Greatest Hits? Your
operating system will contain
software to read the MP3 and
send the audio data in a form
which your sound card will
understand, through to your
speakers. Your whole end
user computer experience is
based around your operating
system, and there is fierce
rivalry from different camps
as to which operating system
is the best. This week I’ll try
to give you an idea about the
main alternatives, and wheth-
er they’re suited to what you
want to do. It’s important to
keep in mind the idiom: if it
ain’t broke, why fix it?
Pros
Free, open source so gen-
erally better security. Quite
a large user base so lots of
software available for free
– alternatives to Microsoft
Office are available, as well
as all the tools you’d need for
graphics, audio, maths and
even games. Some distribu-
tions are easy to install and
use – trying to emulate the
Windows ease of use factor.
Make great web/email serv-
ers. Will run fine on older
machines which might not be
able to cope with the require-
ments of Windows. Users
tend to be enthusastic so
there’s lots of support (see
Imperial Linux User group).
Cons
Won’t have all the hard-
ware support that Windows
has, although manufactur-
ers are clueing up to the
growing use of Linux – you
only have to check the sys-
tem requirements list on
many computer items to
see Linux listed underneath
Windows and Mac. Can be a
very large pain in the arse
when you can’t find driv-
ers for your printer and the
monitor refuses to show in
high resolution; not to men-
tion the modem is unsup-
ported and requires chang-
ing. Depending on your
distribution, may require
copious amounts of writing
commands on a black back-
ground to get the mouse
working etc.
Conclusion
Coding boffin? Get Linux on
an old PC and you’ll be tink-
ering for hours.
Pros
Easy to use. Once installed
and set up, which is fairly
painless to do in most cir-
cumstances, it’s easy for peo-
ple of almost any technical
background to be able to surf
the internet, write an email
or letter and print it out after-
wards. You can even print
envelopes without too much
difficulty. Being by far the
most widely used operating
system for home PC users,
it has an enormously large
choice of software, including
games. For the same reason,
hardwaremanufacturerswho
make graphics cards, sound
cards and all the bit and bobs
you could want to use on your
computer have this market in
mind when producing items
– so all of them will work on
Windows (well, they’re sup-
posed to).
Cons
Has the largest number of
exploits, viruses and worms
of any of the operating sys-
tems listed here – partly due
to its popularity, but also due
to poor security. As many a
disgruntled user will know,
crashes can be frequent, and
frequently reinstalling can
be required. Tends to eat
up system resources and is
commercial software, so the
inner workings are protect-
ed by Microsoft. This is the
opposite philosophy of “open
source” software, which
releases its source code to
the community. This way you
don’t know how the software
is written, and hence can’t fix
bugs easily or reliably. Also
changing system settings can
be tiresome, and sometimes
you don’t know what the
machine is really doing.
Conclusion
Standard essay writing/gen-
eral school use? Get yourself
a relatively cheap PC with
Windows.
Pros
Extremely lightweight,
not at all heavy on system
resources. Very secure,
has least amount of serious
bugs. Generally good hard-
ware support. Superb serv-
ers. NetBSD, one particular
type of BSD, has been ported
or transferred to run on an
incredible range of compu-
ter architectures (over 50)
including Playstation 2 and
Dreamcast. As with Linux,
if you want to change some-
thing on your system, such
as your IP address or what
system services you have,
you’ll just have to edit one
or two files with a command
line editor and you’re done!
Cons
It’s not GUI. Well not until
you’ve installed it, the X
Window graphical system,
needing to know the syn-
chronization frequencies
of your monitor, got your
mouse working, installed a
window manager, installed
linux emulation, java under
linux emulation, then a bloat-
ed office package to make
your powerpoint presenta-
tions at the risk of grinding
your computer to a halt. It’s
not ideal for game playing,
although there are a few 3D
games available, but BSD
based machines make great
servers.
Conclusion
Coding boffin: this is the
OS for you. Others needn’t
apply.
There are 3 main types
of BSD, all derived
from Berkeley Software
Distribution, a split from
UNIX System V. It’s open
source like Linux and
has many similarities.
Pros
It’s really pretty. I mean real-
ly. Very easy to use, less com-
plicated than any of the other
operating systems. Stunning
graphics, a great range of
software and major games
are available. With Apple,
design is everything, and this
is true for their operating
system. It’s uncluttered, easy
and straightforward to use
so there’s less to confuse a
novice user.
Cons
Expensive. Very expensive.
You’re looking upwards of
£1000 for a desktop, but you
get what you pay for.
Conclusion
Graphic design? Mac’s your
best option, but a good PC
with Windows will have the
designing software you need.
Unlike the other operating systems listed, MacOS X only runs on Apple’s com-
puter systems. This means to use it you have to buy their systems, which are
expensive. Their latest operating system is based on a BSD kernel, and has
converted many users by its beauty and the fact that it works smoothly.
According to market reports, Microsoft’s operating systems are used on
over 90% of home users’ computers. The latest version is Windows XP
which in most cases you’ll be using around college and will have pre-
installed on any new computer you buy.
Linux is the name of the kernel, or central part, of a free operating system
developed from 1991 by Linus Torvalds and the internet community of open
source developers.
