Feel like a smoke?
When the Government acted to
reclassify cannabis, there was a lot
of confusion over its legality. The
truth is that cannabis is still illegal,
and if you are using it over a long
period of time it can affect every
aspect of your life.
This article aims to help you and
tell you some facts about cannabis
that you might not know:
Dependency
During the last few years it has
become clear that cannabis use can
result in dependency and lead to
problems. Ask yourself this: Are you
spending too much time, energy and
money on weed? Does a lot of your
day revolve around dope? Do those
close to you complain that you are
stoned all the time? If your answer
to these questions is yes then you
may be dependent on cannabis.
Mental health
If you have had a mental health
problem before or if you have a his-
tory of mental health problems in
your family, cannabis can trigger
them. There is also concern that
people who use cannabis a lot when
they are young may be vulnerable to
mental health problems later in life.
Debt
One of the most common problems
with cannabis is spending too much
money on it. Try to see how much
money you are spending each week
on cannabis and think about all the
other things you could buy with the
money.
Relationships
Cannabis can make people boring,
lifeless and isolated. Smoking dope
all the time can lead to problems
at work, in your personal life and at
college.
Do you have a vibrant social life or
are you staying in most nights and
watching TV? Is your partner giving
you earache about your lack of moti-
vation? Are you just smoking canna-
bis because your partner does?
If these things are happening to
you, it may be time to review your
cannabis use.
College life
Studying and smoking cannabis in
most cases don’t mix. If you smoke
cannabis on a regular basis, you
may well be missing lectures, unmo-
tivated by university life, and/or just
sitting indoors all day.
It is also important to remember
that if you are found to be smok-
ing cannabis in University halls of
residence, then you will probably be
evicted and may be asked to leave
the College totally.
The law
Cannabis is a class C drug. It is ille-
gal. The maximum sentence for pos-
session is two years in prison and an
unlimited fine. The maximum penal-
ty for supplying cannabis is 14 years
in prison and an unlimited fine.
People aged 18 or over are no
longer automatically arrested for
possessing cannabis, however you
will be arrested if you are caught
regularly, you smoke in public
places, or you use cannabis near
premises where children and young
people go.
Self control tips
● Avoid overdoing it, by having days
off between using cannabis. This
will also help you to lose any toler-
ance you might have built up from
regular use
● Don’t buy extra, thinking you’ll
save some for tomorrow. You prob-
ably won’t
● Break up your pattern of use
– this will make it easier to control
and reduce the risks
● If you are trying to cut down and
stop, avoid any places, people or
events that remind you of cannabis.
Plan to do something else at the
time of day you usually have a joint
● Try to identify all the things you
associate with using cannabis and
make an effort to avoid them until
you feel OK about not smoking

STUDENT ADVISER
The cost of living
A common student complaint is that
the cost of living in halls is too high.
Rents are too expensive and it is
often more economical to live in
the private sector – often even after
things like gas/electricity bills, laun-
dry and contents insurance (all free
or subsidised in halls) have been
taken into account. Is this really
true?
It’s certainly true that some
rooms in halls are priced at quite
high levels. Paying around £140 a
week (after amenities and other
charges) for a room in Beit can
seem excessive when private sector
flats are available for less than that.
Nevertheless, the College has a real
problem: there is no government
money to fund halls of residence
which, by law, have to be self-financ-
ing. In actual fact, the College gets
away, where it can, with cross-sub-
sidies but basically the halls have
to break even. The cost of building
and maintaining halls of residence
has to be met somehow. Only so
much money can be raised from
conference income. Ultimately, the
residents have to make a large con-
tribution.
That was the backdrop to last
year when Katherine McGinn (then
Deputy President Education &
Welfare) and I faced the Rector’s
Committee on Student Residences
for the annual rent review. The
Estates people responsible for look-
ing after the buildings maintained
that they needed an increase of
upwards of 10% in order to keep
things in order. We successfully
argued the case that students were
increasingly being priced out and
that they needed to be contained.
In the end we secured an average
real rise of only 4.5%, although the
cheapest rooms stayed at the same
price whilst the most expensive had
large increases.
Yet the maintenance problems are
real. Only yesterday, my own hall
of residence had problems with the
drinking water supply – unusual for
Garden Hall, but quite common for
those in Southside. Any ‘success’
the Union has in holding down rent
prices in the short term is only going
to cause problems for students in
the long-term. Just look at the crum-
bling state of Southside and Fisher
Hall, both suffering from shoddy
maintenance and underinvestment
over the years. But every time a
hall is refurbished, the rents have to
go up to pay for it. This means that
when Southside is knocked down at
the end of June 2004, there will be a
serious reduction in medium-priced
accommodation and a big overall
increase in average rent prices.
So a new approach is needed.
The College needs to recognise
that whilst Beit is always over-sub-
scribed (and so the rents can seem-
ingly keep going-up) there are many
students who can’t pay the full cost.
More importantly, ‘poorer’ students
should not be given lower quality
accommodation as it is demean-
ing and also results in ghettoisa-
tion (with some halls being seen as
‘rich’ and others as being for ‘poor’
students).
I think that all students who come
to the College should be given a
fixed price for living in hall, which
should be the full cost – let’s say
£150 per week. From that, there
should then be subsidies (paid for
within the residences system).
Students who are allocated poorer
quality rooms should be compen-
sated with a rebate. Students who
can’t afford to pay should similarly
receive a bursary to enable them
to live in hall. This should be sep-
arate from government loans etc,
because it would appear that the
most hard-up students fall into two
categories: those for whom the state
means testing doesn’t work (eg they
are just above the threshold for full
support or their parents’ income
has been mis-assessed) or they are
from overseas and not in receipt of
a scholarship. That way, everyone
would be able to live in hall and
wouldn’t be forced into a particu-
larly shabby one based on the ability
to pay. Meanwhile, those who can
pay their share would do, to keep the
system operational.
That’s a personal view, based on a
pragmatic appraisal of the political
and economic situation. I suspect
it will be be controversial – I look
forward to reading your views in the
letters pages.

UNION PRESIDENT
STATE OF

Today I had to step around the body
of a man on my way to campus,
trying to avoid getting blood on my
shoes. I’ve never seen a dead body
before, but in the last week two peo-
ple have died violently in the streets
near me. What is happening?
The apparent cause was that the
man had jumped off the roof, but the
police had to investigate it as a mur-
der. They asked me if I’d seen any-
one upstairs. Not being a city boy,
it didn’t occur to me to look. It says
something about the times we live
in that I just carried on walking, the
police seemed to be dealing with it
and I hadn’t actually seen it happen,
so I just went to uni, sat through a
lecture and came home.
On the way home, the police had
cordoned off the area in a very effi-
cient manner. This is disturbing in a
strange way; the police knew exactly
what to do, they had a procedure
for it. I mean, it’s comfortable that
the police are professional, but why
should they have to deal with this
sort thing so often?
I only came to London a couple
of months ago, and my first impres-
sions were that people were exag-
gerating about the violence and the
crime, that the newspapers used a
lot of hyperbole and only reported
the bad events. These two deaths
have blown that impression out
of the water. I now leave my halls
wondering what will happen today,
wondering who will die. Will it be
someone I know? Will it be me?
I don’t know what drove this man to
suicide, or whether he was pushed,
but surely there must be something
that can be done to prevent this sort
of thing happening. Support groups
obviously aren’t enough. I’m sure
this man had access to a telephone,
but he didn’t phone the Samaritans,
did he? Maybe his friends were
suspicious and were rushing to his
house to stop him, or maybe he had
no friends.
The only thing we can do is to
watch out for each other, keep an
eye on the lonely people, or even the
ones who are always surrounded,
are they really happy? Suicide is
an intensely selfish act. Think of
the anguish this man has caused
to the people who saw him fall, to
his friends and family, who will prob-
ably blame themselves. He caused
me to be in a state of shock and
write this rambling article, despite
that fact I haven’t written an essay
in years.
Even the most cold-hearted of you
couldn’t help to be shocked by this if
you saw it. My friend and I tried to
laugh it off, but we both knew this
was just to distract our thoughts, to
avoid thinking the big thoughts that
I thought on the way home, alone. To
question our own mortality. I leave
you with my final thought – don’t
think you’re unshockable, because
when something like this happens,
it really, really gets to you.
