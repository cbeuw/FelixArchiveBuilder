This week saw the announce-
ment by the Chancellor of the
Exchequer, Gordon Brown, of
his plans for the next year
in the pre-budget report.
This might seem a bit dry,
but it sets out the way that-
the Labour party will run the
country for the next year, and
as this is an election year,
possibly the next four years
as well. The Budget report
was very political indeed this
year, which hints that Labour
will be using the economy as
the centre of their general
election campaign.
The pre-budget report was
widely described as being
unexciting, focusing as it did
on causes that nobody could
moan about. The Telegraph
did, admittedly, have a go, but
it was a bit half-hearted: “If
this is the man who is likely
to personify Labour’s next
incarnation in power, it is vital
to know what he proposes to
do with the national wealth
whose growth he believes is
his achievement. Yesterday,
he gave a clear and ringing
answer to that question: he
intends to spend it.”
The most important ideas
that the Chancellor put for-
ward were all based on the
family: to increase paid mater-
nity leave to nine months, to
extend nursery places and
the Sure Start scheme, and to
give single parents an extra
£40 per week if they go back to
work. All very voter-friendly.
The Sun described the
Chancellor as “spraying £50
notes at babies, mums and
dads” – nothing to complain
about there, you would think.
The proposals are also, how-
ever, really rather expensive.
This surprised a lot of people
who were expected some sort
of mention of the fact that the
economy appears to be down-
turning, and that Brown
might not meet his famous
but strict self-imposed Golden
Rule – that spending matches
investment over the electoral
cycle. But those commenta-
tors had obviously forgotten
that this is an election year
and therefore all facts which
are not 100% positive and
spinnable for the Government
are brushed under the carpet.
In addition, it was pointed out
that the fact that this is an
election year means that this
is a very short parliamentary
session and therefore many
of these bills have no chance
of becoming law before the
House is closed for the elec-
tion. Basically, he could say
whatever he wanted.
The Financial Times also
warned that the chances of
tax rises after the election
are high, and The Observer
pointed out that Brown is
nearly always right, unlike
his “self-righteous and nearly
permanently wrong critics”.
The proposals were very
popular, however, and very
Brownite in their focus on
family policies and away from
the law, order and terror-
ism cocktail that had been
the Queen’s Speech a week
before. This excited a lot of
commentators into thinking
that this was Brown’s mani-
festo and he was going to set
out his stall for the leadership
of the Labour party.
Perhaps they are being a
bit premature, but it does
appear that Brown will have
to do something soon, seeing
as Blair has declared that he
would like to serve throughout
the entire (four year) term.
So it may be that we see some
action from Brown before the
election, if he believes that it
may be his only chance.
