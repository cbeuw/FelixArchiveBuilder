Transport is a hot topic in London.
Most people live too far from work
to walk. Public transport can be
expensive for students and unpleas-
ant for everybody. Driving is out
of the question for the majority of
Londoners due to clogged streets,
lack of parking and the high cost.
The morning news consists of a
catalogue of catastrophe on road
and rail. It is little wonder that the
mayoral elections are dominated by
transport issues.
But there is a way out of this
locomotive rat race: cycling. Many
cyclists talk as if their chosen mode
of transport is the solution to the
world’s problems – and it is easy to
see why.
Cycling is cheap. You can get a
brand new bike and associated gear
for under £200 from Halfords or
Decathlon, and even less if you buy
second hand. Alternatively you could
get something a bit more luxurious
for around £400 from a local bike
shop – still far cheaper than your
average Travelcard, but it will last
a good few years. And you won’t be
paying to stand stationary in a tun-
nel for half an hour with your face in
someone else’s armpit.
Cycling is fast. Transport for
London figures suggest that cycling
is the fastest mode of transport in
central London. You can travel four
miles in just 20 minutes, compared
to half an hour by tube or an hour
by bus. And cycling is door-to-door
– chances are most of your com-
mute is spent walking to and from
stations.
Cycling gets you fit. The obesity
epidemic is in full swing, and you
can be sure that sitting on a bus eat-
ing crisps is doing nothing for your
physique. Regular cycling halves
your chances of suffering from heart
disease. The Government recom-
mends that adults get 30 minutes of
moderate exercise five times each
week. Cycling to College will give
you all that and more, without wast-
ing precious time and money in the
local gym.
Cycling is fun. While initially the
prospect of getting on a bike is
daunting, it rapidly becomes eas-
ier and more rewarding. There’s
nothing more satisfying than arriv-
ing at your destination having
got there under your own steam.
You’ve cut through the traffic, flown
past the bus queues and bypassed
the crowded stations, using your
natural strength, skill and dexterity
to get from A to B. You can make
it an exhilarating everyday extreme
sport or a scenic ride through
parks and along waterways – your
choice.
And finally, of course, cycling is
environmentallyandsociallyrespon-
sible. It is unlikely you’ll end up kill-
ing anyone with your bike, unlike
cars which result in the deaths of
3500 people in the UK each year.
Every other mode of transport bar
walking uses energy derived from
fossil fuels. Those who aren’t con-
vinced by global warming (both of
you) will nonetheless have experi-
enced the unpleasant side-effects
of walking along London’s choked
streets. Biofuels are here today: two
slices of toast and a coffee goes in,
and out comes enough energy to get
you to College (and a little bit of, er,
exhaust). Imagine London’s streets
without the noise and smell and
danger of motor vehicles. You can
make it happen.
What’s the down side? There’s
always a down side. People are put
off by bad weather: in fact, London is
the driest part of the UK and only a
tiny fraction of your journeys will be
wet. You can choose to take the day
off and get back on the tube (you’ll
remember why you started cycling)
or just get some waterproofs and
carry on regardless.
Some people are worried they’ll
get to College reeking of sweat and
fumes. You might be lucky and have
odourless sweat – just wear clean
clothes every day, use a deodorant,
and your popularity will be main-
tained. Alternatively take a shower
at College instead of at home. A
map of College showers is being
prepared – every department has
one or two tucked away somewhere.
See these pages for news in the
coming weeks, or ask your head of
department.
Danger from cars and buses is
also quite off-putting for novices. A
prerequisite is that you are a com-
petent cyclist when on traffic-free
routes. Take it easy for the first few
weeks and you’ll build up experi-
ence of how to deal with London’s
traffic. Kensington and Chelsea
local authority offer free cycle safety
courses – email road.safety@rbkc.
gov.uk. You could prepare yourself
for the open road with Cyclecraft by
John Franklin (ISBN: 0117020516),
a book which is widely regarded as
the authority on cycle safety. My
personal top tips are: don’t ride in
the gutter, ignore cycle lanes, be
aware of what is going on around
you, use lights, and observe the
Highway Code.
The last hurdle is parking and
security. Cycle parking at Imperial
has taken a nosedive over summer.
The handy parking outside your
department has gone, replaced by
motorcycle and car parking. You
must now use a swipe-carded cage
up some stairs under the Big Blue
Faculty building.
The racks are tough to use, but
with some creativity and practice
they are almost as secure as street
parking, and they are undercover.
You must register with Security
before your swipe card will work.
Elsewhere in London, the Mayor
has handed cyclists a small army of
excellent cycle racks, so you can do
your shopping or go to the cinema
in confidence. The parking in High
Street Kensington actually won a
design award last year.
A cycling group is being set up
at Imperial, which will campaign
for better facilities and generally
support cyclists. The first stage is
a mailing list, http://mailman.ic.ac.
uk/mailman/listinfo/bike-users. Old,
new and future cyclists are encour-
aged to subscribe, ask advice and
offer wisdom.
Your student years are the best
time to start cycling, when body
and bank balance are likely to be
less than healthy. When you disap-
pear to your career in merchant
banking, you might end up chugging
around in a BMW or sweating it
out on the tube. But chances are
you’ll find it hard to kick the cycling
habit.
Why cycling is the answer
Ben Jefferys explains why travelling by good old-fashioned push-bike is beneficial to both
you and the environment
“Many cyclists talk as if their chosen mode of transport is the solution to the world’s problems – and it is easy to see why”
By Vikas Kaura
I should not be writing this in a state
of anger, however, I will.
Why is it that Londoners (well,
those on the tubes) are so socially
inept? Is it so hard for a 20-year-old
to give up his seat to an older gen-
tleman with a walking stick? Well
I guess so, as this is what I have
just observed and it is not a one-off
case. I use the tube every day and,
day in and day out, I see the same
thing – the elderly get pushed to the
back at the platform and crushed in
the middle on the trains rather than
having seats vacated for them.
What is it about London that
makes people think less than cer-
tain ‘lower’ species of animals?
Back in Newcastle I am sure,
although we sound very uncivilised,
we conform to a much better moral
standards than our London coun-
terparts do. Even though trains are
less frequent, I know the majority of
Geordies would give up their seat or
even just wait at the platform for the
next train if we were to see 70-year-
olds struggling to get on.
Is it too much to ask of people to
stand for 15 minutes of their life or
put their plans on hold for a minute
or two by catching the next tube?
Is it such a hinderance on your life
to allow an older person in a fragile
state to have a comfortable journey
at your expense? Well it seems so!
Although, rather than painting a
completely negative picture, I did
also see a rarity: on the same train, a
young lady swiftly vacated her seat,
allowing an old lady to sit down. The
old lady was so happy and thankful.
I presumed that the girl was either
a ‘northerner’ or from abroad. It
is a sad situation when people are
rendered to think along these lines,
but can you blame me after observ-
ing the normal London tube users’
behaviour?
To conclude, I would urge eve-
ryone to try to smile on the tube
– it makes your journey a lot better,
trust me. Break this vicious circle of
defensive body language and mis-
ery. Just think, how you would feel
when you are in your seventies and
fragile, yet a youth of 20 cannot show
you some moral decency.
