Having previously subjected myself
to two other West End musicals
– Les Miserables and Fame – and
come out feeling thoroughly violat-
ed, it was with some trepidation that
I attempted a third, The Lion King,
last Wednesday evening.
Both previous musicals had been
expensive mistakes – two hours of
shoddy, half-hearted performance,
replete with tired clichés, medio-
cre song and badly choreographed
dance. Despite these unpromising
initial experiences, I had not heard
a bad word spoken about The Lion
King – indeed oft proclaimed the
musical of all musicals (an ambigu-
ous compliment in my mind). So,
taking a deep breath, I crossed my
fingers and hoped for the best.
And the best is indeed what I got.
The Lion King is a stunning piece of
musical theatre (note: musical thea-
tre, not musical with all its nega-
tive connotations). From the sleek
live orchestra, effective staging and
reverberating song to the phenome-
nal costumes, everything about this
show signals a professionalism and
dedication quite obviously lacking
in many other West End perform-
ances.
The show opens with the chant
of an African woman, bouncing off
the walls of the theatre, filling every
crevice with rich, vibrant sound, and
knocking all other thought from your
head. The stage then fills with a
menagerie of fantastically clad men
and women, providing a snapshot
of the jungle kingdom. This first
tableau sets the scene for the magic
to come. There are men on stilts
dressed as timid giraffes, four men
caged into an elephant suit, a lithe
young woman roaming the stage as
a panther, and hordes more perform-
ers in varying stages of animal dis-
guise. These fill the stage in a flurry
of uplifting song and dance and glue
your eyes to the unbelievable display
being unveiled before you.
From this impressive begin-
ning, the well-known story unfolds
with the introduction of evil Scar,
the old King Mufasa and his young
cub, Simba. While Scar excels in
his role as the evil uncle, from a
start as the underdog scathing of
the present regime to his demise
into a ridiculous leper, he is enter-
taining throughout. Conversely, both
Mufasa and the young Simba are
weak leads. Neither come close to
meriting stage space with the glori-
ous backdrop of animal magic with
which they share each scene. Both
are unconvincing main characters
and fail to invoke sympathy for their
plight. Mufasa overemphasises his
role as benevolent king and young
Simba, with his tacky grin and false
amity, simply grates on the nerves.
Somehow, and luckily, such short-
comings fail to impinge on an other-
wise spectacular performance. One
is led to ignore the hiccups of indi-
vidual artists and become immersed
instead in the wonderland expertly
evoked by a talented team of set and
costume designers. Throughout, one
is aware that no expense has been
spared to produce authentic set-
pieces and magnificent costumes.
In fact, The Lion King deserves
viewing if only for a montage of
its costumes. Each player has been
transformed into a fantastic char-
acter, including the conniving hyena
stooped over and dressed in a grey
cape, a mask suspended from its
forehead which bounces maniacally
as it pounds the stage. Then there
are the synchronised jungle trees
of agile dancers decked out in vivid
green leotards and sporting trails
of green silk who spin and pulsate
across the stage. In a bizarre musi-
cal interlude, towering giraffes fill
the stage, kitted out in multi-col-
oured silk cloaks emblazoned with
patterns and swirls, and launch into
toe-tapping song and surprisingly
nimble dance. Such examples are
just a taster of the weird and won-
derful creatures one is exposed to in
the course of the show. No doubt you
will find your own favourite among
the throng.
Perhaps you are now asking
whether I’ve been paid to advertise
the show, by the quantity of superla-
tives splashed across this article.
I haven’t. The Lion King really is
an outstanding piece of entertain-
ment and should be seen by every-
one. Whether you want to take leave
of your intellect and embrace the
familiar songs and well-known story
or prefer to marvel at such an amaz-
ing theatrical production, or indeed
do both, you will undoubtedly come
out satisfied. Go now!

Excellent! You could be just who we
are looking for!
Every year, Dramsoc puts on a
number of plays for your amuse-
ment. One of the chosen pieces this
year is the pantomime, Jack and
the Beanstalk (the first pantomime
Dramsoc has ever done!) It is to
be performed in the Union Concert
Hall on January 18 to 22. Well, that
was the idea anyway, but there is
one slight problem: the lack of a
giant to live up Jack’s beanstalk!
That’s right, Dramsoc has run out
of actors (don’t worry, there are still
plenty of techies so the Union can
continue to run smoothly). So this is
where all you talented people come
in. Instead of simply watching the
pantomime you can be in it!
Now before all you little people
stop reading, the giant can be big
or small (irony is a brilliant thing)!
It doesn’t matter whether you have
never done any acting before in
your life; this isn’t Shakespeare, this
is pantomime! All you need is to
be keen and be willing to attend
rehearsals, which happen every
Thursday or Tuesday evening (you
will not be required to attend all
rehearsals). Rehearsals are very
relaxed and friendly (and often
involve alcohol) and the cast (so far)
are great! If you are interested in
being a giant, and fancy grinding up
people’s bones to make your bread,
then email Tom the director at
thomas.cafferkey@ic.ac.uk.
● If you’re really not the partici-
pating type, remember that there
are still some arts events going on
in college right up until the end of
term.
The Choir have their concert
tomorrow in the Great Hall, start-
ing at 8.00pm. Their programme
includes the latest version of
Mozart’s not quite finished Requiem,
Bach’s Magnificat and Beethoven’s
Hallelujah, this particular version
coming from the Mount of Olives.
The Mozart is a hugely powerful
piece and you’ve all probably heard
at least a snippet or two of it and
should really hear a complete per-
formance.
Sinfonietta have their concert, in
the same location, on Tuesday; be
prepared to be blown away by some
Wagner and Copland!
Wanted: one giant
(size not important!)
Iain Heaton invites you to join in and do your bit for the panto
Remember: no pain no gain!
However, the Union’s insurance
policy is probably not up to this
type of stuntwork

No singing, no dancing:
Brass do West Side Story
with style and great rhythm
I think I’d be right in saying that
almost all of us are vaguely famil-
iar with Bernstein’s classic West
Side Story. You know, it’s the one
with the same storyline as Romeo
and Juliet, except the action is no
longer in Verona but in New York
and the feuding parties are now
the natives and the invading Puerto
Ricans. The story is a classic, and
so is the music. Last Wednesday, a
privileged few had the pleasure of
hearing Imperial Symphonic Brass
and Percussion play the arrange-
ment for brass of the music from the
show by Eric Crees.
The audience was privileged not
only due to the nature of the venue,
the Union Dining Hall, but also, of
course, in the quality of the perform-
ance. The Crees arrangement, origi-
nally for the London Symphony’s
Brass ensemble, is renowned for
being amongst the toughest, if
not the toughest, arrangement of
Bernstein’s music.
The brass did themselves proud,
not to mention the percussion,
(who for the most part looked a
bit bored, but were probably just
lost in concentration trying to keep
track of a thousand different things
at once, with the exception of Joel
Farland on the drum kit when he
got a chance to show us all what
he could do in style). The perform-
ance was confident and they nailed
all the rhythms and themes that
we’d all come to hear. The range of
dynamics was impressive, bringing
the music to life in a hugely expres-
sive way. The mambo, cha-cha and
America were all full of Latin spirit,
and the finale had some truly heart-
breaking moments.
The performance was full of jazz,
swinging right along, and was over
far too soon! This was a brief con-
cert enjoyed by all attending that
has definitely won the Brass more
fans. Make sure to keep an eye out
for posters on the walkway advertis-
ing future concerts – you will not
regret taking the time to go.
