Imperial Men’s 1st 21
GKT Men’s 1st 12
By Michael Hicks
After a stunning display beat-
ing Chichester 39-14 last
week, Imperial Firsts faced a
strong side in GKT.
Before the match, spirits
were high and despite sev-
eral regular faces missing,
the team was looking sharp.
This showed on the pitch as,
after a tense first five min-
utes, Raph broke through the
back line to score a superb
try near to the posts, Pedder
duly converted and it was 7-0
to Imperial.
Shortly after, Raph broke
through again and with great
supportfromAndyJasudasen,
faced a two on one with the
full back! Unfortunately Raph
went himself, missing the
opportunity for another score
and earning himself a dirty
pint after the match.
Luckily, our attack kept pil-
ing on the pressure and it
wasn’t long before Pedder
touched down for Imperial’s
second try, and converting to
make it 14-0 with only 15 min-
utes gone.
The score was then
increased again when Achi
went over for what was sur-
prisingly his first try of the
year. Pedder was on form
with his boot and it was 21-0
to Imperial.
With the opposition’s heads
down and the game now look-
ing like a formality, some con-
fusion among the back three
left GKT with some good
possession on our 22. This
spurred them into action and
after some desperate defend-
ing they crossed our line to
make it 21-5.
Worse was to come, when
they crossed again and with
the conversion made it 21-12
after forty minutes.
The second half was now all
to play for as both sides had
showed some great form dur-
ing patches of the first 40. As
expected, the game was now
much more even and despite
best efforts, neither team put
any more points on the board,
making the final score 21-12
to Imperial.
Notable performances
came from Jovan Nedic on
his first team debut and
John Bound on coming out of
retirement to stand in for our
honeymooning lock.
This puts the First XV back
at the top of the league with
only three games left to play.

By David Jackson
Imperial Men’s First XV were
ill-prepared to face King’s,
with a plethora of new faces
in the line-up.
The pre-match warm up
was shorter than a dwarf tying
his shoelaces, however this
did not phase the Imperial
team by even a radian.
Quick rucking from a strong
but mobile Imperial pack
allowed their backs to part
the King’s defence in a
‘Moses-esque’ fashion. Some
slinky footwork from Imperial
number seven Raphael fol-
lowed, and Imperial were
jubilantly celebrating their
first try.
This did not dampen regal
spirits however: King’s
pressed hard and converted a
penalty shortly after. Imperial
then began to dominate,
urged on from the touch line
by afflicted captain Michael
Hicks and his subordinate
Achi. Some good work from
Jon Spencer offered Gabriel
the invitation to finish in the
corner, which he took with
aplomb.
King’s were shaken but not
stirred, and subsequently
added a breakaway try of their
own. Imperial increased their
lead however when Mark
Wills thundered over the line
with King’s defenders clutch-
ing at his garments. The half
time score was Imperial 21,
King’s 10.
The second half proved
much the same as the first;
Imperial knocking at the
King’s door with the fervour
of a ravenous wolf, but the
King’s defence wise to the
danger, like three little pigs
with television screen entry
intercom on their cottage.
Eventually incessant pres-
sure paid off, and following a
superb catch and drive line-
out and good work from débu-
tante Nathan, James Pedder
glided in for Imperial’s fourth
try.
Imperial’s defence was
then tested as Kings rallied
for a late surge. Imperial prop
David Jackson was harshly
sin-binned. The writer of this
report has it on good author-
ity that he was incredibly
unlucky.
King’s made there numbers
advantage pay and converted
an overlap in the corner,
much to the delight of their
rowdy supporters. Imperial
answered with a fifth and final
try minutes after the restart,
when a cleverly worked blind
side move ended with Gabriel
off-loading to the omnipres-
ent Steve McLellan. The
final whistle blew as Andrew
Towers’ conversion attempt
was waylaid by the wind.

Imperial Men’s 3rd 77
St Bart’s Men’s 2nd 3
By Andy Wright
We found ourselves in South
London about to play rugby.
The mission: to destroy St
Barts, I repeat – to destroy
St Barts.
After an initial advance
by the heavy armour of the
Imperial forwards, a preci-
sion strike from Nick ‘Iceman’
Warde opened up the scoring.
His follow-up conversion shot
was just as clinical. Then Joe
‘Panzer’ Sanders led a break
into St Barts’ rear echelon
and after great support put
the bomb on target.
On the next advance Ben
‘Lamb Chops’ Thompson
received the ball, after the
opposition were duped by
Alex ‘Ballerina’ Fergusson,
and went through for a score.
Great play throughout the
squad led to more tries for
Fergusson and Sanders,
who used his forward-firing
beer belly to barge through
the defence like a German
tank through French resist-
ance. Further scores came
from Pete ‘KGB’ Sannikov,
Will ‘The Corporal’ Mews and
‘Lamb Chops’ again.
Chris ‘Budgie’ Gosden
converted most attempts,
and some excellent strike
tackles were seen from Tom
‘The Hitter’ Peatman. It
was a total victory, thanks
to good team work and dis-
cipline and to the planning
and leadership of Wing
Commander Dan ‘Peanut
Head’ Lindsley.

RSM Men’s 1st 21
HAC Men’s 1st 7
Captain Eddy Poulding didn’t
know whether to laugh or cry
when he marched his group
of rotting miners past a fit
looking HAC team sporting
a fresh tan from their recent
tour of southern Iraq. Little
did he know that the most
valiant warriors would turn
out to be on his side.
The kick off was shortly
followed by savage screams
from scrum half and vice
captain Quincy Allan, in an
attempt to somewhat intimi-
date the opposition. The
screams, however, didn’t last
for long, as Allan was forced
to come off due to fatigue.
After some ferocious driv-
ing from rucking team alpha
(Tom Hawkins, Joe Franklin,
Stefan Nubert and John
Sykes) the firsts points finally
came from Imperial legend
Tim ‘the prowler’ Praill, who,
with his huge tackles and
mountains of experience, was
kind enough to provide the
Royal School of Mines team
with a magnificent try which
fly half Nick Warde converted
with exceptional ease.
Unfortunately for the RSM,
the Honourable Artillery
Corps were able to scrape
a handful of pathetic points
when, after a mistake from
the forwards, Chaps club
president and full back Rob
Thomas was faced with a one
on one with the HAC fly half.
The fly half would certainly
have ended up in hospital
had Mr Thomas not attended
the formidable ’22 dinner the
night before.
Nevertheless, the mighty
RSM struck back with superb
perforating runs from cen-
tres Alex O’Rourke and Andy
Irving.
Eventually, sometime after
the kick that went straight
into water boy Fergusson’s
face, Kim Grogan body check-
ing his opposite winger and
Quincy’s ‘double dummy
side step’, Eddy Poulding
decided it was time to score
two outstanding tries to
demolish the shell-shocked
HAC side.
Special mentions should
also go to rucking team bravo
(consisting of Tim Praill,
James Davies, Josh Wright
and James Clark) for their
swift clearing out and hands
on approach towards the HAC
pack, and to the side’s only
person who plays rugby on a
regular basis for the Imperial
medics, RSM vice-president
Mike Seager for being such a
cool guy.
