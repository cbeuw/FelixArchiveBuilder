Wye Women’s 1st 78
UCL Women’s 1st 5
By Suzanne Horn
Wye weren’t lying about their
winning streak. With a con-
vincing win over UCL, who
would have thought that Wye
had just gone a month with-
out a match? The team were
on fire and ready to throw
themselves at any opposi-
tion.
The massive score shows
our complete dominance
in this game. The amazing
rucking skills of our forwards
made sure we nearly always
had the ball, while the flair
and sheer speed of the backs
gave the crowd some exhila-
rating runs.
Em scored two amaz-
ing tries, managing to run
around all of the opposition,
obliterating the UCL defence.
Winger Kipling also added
some points to the score,
with her storming runs from
set plays. Her talking on the
pitch was excellent. Gobby’s
kicking was superb, convert-
ing over half of all tries.
However this isn’t to say
our forwards weren’t excit-
ing. Our sweaty Hetty man-
aged to score a flurry of tries,
all of which would have led
to Jeremy Guscott leaping
out of his commentary seat
with pure amazement! Liking
the netball moves, Hetty was
deservedly given player of
the match for her fantastic
five tries, her solid rucking
performance and simply raw
aggression.
The scrum was viciously
contested at every chance by
both teams. But the Wye pack
lead by hooker Cat was awe-
some, turning the ball over
in the scrum on many occa-
sions through brute force.
Pike’s tackling and mauling
was on top form throughout
the entire match. Lineouts
were also strong with excel-
lent jumping by Spaz and
Zena.
The Wye girls did them-
selves proud. Rugby is a
team game, so without the
100% effort displayed by
all, the fantastic score of
78-5 could not have been
achieved. Kate, Kayleigh and
Alice braved the opposition
and the cold to participate in
their first match of the sea-
son. Well done girls. There
were almost too many tries
to count. Let’s hope this will
be the case in a week’s time
against the Virgins.
Thanks go to our coach,
the refereee, the two touch
judges, all our supporters and
of course our two cheerlead-
ers/water boys. Let’s keep up
the winning streak.

UCL no match for Wye
RVC Men’s 1st 1
Imperial Men’s 4th 0
By Michael Nicholson
The intrepid Fourths made
the trek to deepest darkest
Hertfordshire to face RVC,
who had emerged from for-
tress Harlington with an ill-
deserved draw in the previ-
ous meeting between the two
sides.
Due to the total idiocy of the
RVC captain, the majority of
the Fourths went to the wrong
ground, meaning that at kick-
off the sun was already begin-
ning to set. The only option
was to play a shortened game
of thirty minutes each way.
It was an unfamiliar side
that took to the darkened
pitch, with illness, injury,
and random trips to Bury
(Aldridge-Carlos) taking their
toll. New signing JJ contin-
ued at right back with Toony
moving across to the centre
to partner Shinguards. The
surprise choice at left back
was Jai, whose place up front
was taken by another new
boy, Danny.
The lack of a warm-up led
to a horrifically scrappy first
half with neither team get-
ting into their stride. The
makeshift defence was cop-
ing admirably, and Vanni was
performing well in a sweeper/
keeper role. Chances how-
ever were at a premium, and
even when shooting opportu-
nities did present themselves
both sides were strangely
reluctant to let fly. The only
real moment of interest came
when the Mullet got away
from Shinguards after what
looked like a blatant push
and found himself through on
goal. However, the veteran
centre half showed speed to
recover and get the ball away
with a well-timed challenge.
The second half provided
a lot more in terms of goal-
scoring opportunities; unfor-
tunately they all fell to the
Vets. The Mullet twice man-
aged to produce decent shots
from tight angles, and Vanni
managed to make a couple of
outstanding stops.
The game was destined to
finish nil-nil until the very last
moment, when the Vets got
the break of the ball in mid-
field allowing their winger to
escape down the right. His
cross was met by the Mullet
whose shot deflected off
Toony right into the path of
their onrushing midfielder,
who had no problem finishing
into the corner.
It was a sickening blow,
worsened by the referee’s
whistle before Imperial could
even kick off again. I could go
on a rant about how unfair all
this was, but I won’t. We’ll just
win the Cup instead.
Vets get
lucky... again

Imperial Men’s 2nd 4
SOAS Men’s 1st 1
By Chris Jermyn
On a crisp Saturday morn-
ing, Team Bouncebackability
made their way to Fortress
Cobham to take on the School
of Oriental and African
Studies.
It was clear from the off
who the better side was, the
Seconds passing the ball
around well with Has and
Easter dominating the mid-
dle and Leigh and DAL flying
down the wings. Still, in true
Second team tradition, SOAS
scored first, Geike imperson-
ating a dying penguin by fall-
ing over at the back to allow
their centre forward to walk
through and score. The goal
didn’t faze us though as it was
clearly only a matter of time
before our dominance paid
off, although for all of our pos-
session the score remained
1-0 at half time.
The second half started as
the first half ended, with Will
and Geike solid at the back
and Kimmo steamrolling his
way down the wing. After
ten minutes we finally broke
through, Greedy weaving his
way past their entire team to
slot the ball past the funboy
‘keeper. The goal settled our
nerves and apart from a few
smart saves from Von Orford
there was only going to be
one outcome.
After more pressure,
Greedy bagged his second,
a Bergkamp-esque flick from
Jermyn putting him through
to finish coolly. Some neat
interplay around the box then
allowed Garro to turn on a
sixpence and finish in the bot-
tom corner.
With five minutes to go, a
long ball from goalkeeper
Orford and an uncanny Geike
impersonation from SOAS’
Hobbit centre back allowed
Jermyn to walk through their
defence and roll the ball into
the empty net.
The Seconds can look for-
ward to a spring term with
confidence to ensure a third
season in the ULU premier
league.
Seconds first
at last in ULU
