Yes guys, it’s the time of year when
we need to be jolly, forget all our
troubles, and brave the clustered
streets of central London to get our
shopping done. It’s also the time
when those Hollywood moguls capi-
talise on the season by drowning us
all with the usual dose of Christmas
films – some ultimate turkeys and
others worthy smash hits. Will direc-
tor Joe Roth’s latest offering pass
the test? Possibly.
The unofficial king of Christmas
blockbusters is back. No, I don’t
mean the overweight dude in the
red suit (though he does make a
small role in the film), I mean Tim
Allen. With Christmas blockbust-
ers like The Santa Claus under his
belt, the former Home Improvement
actor appears alongside an impres-
sive all-star line up in this feel-good
comedy.
Allen stars as Luther Krank, a
goofy family man living in a subur-
ban neighbourhood with his wife
Nora (Jamie Lee Curtis) and teen-
age daughter Blair (Julie Gonzalo).
The Kranks are famous among their
neighbourhood for marking the fes-
tive season by throwing their usual
parties, so imagine how mortifying it
was to the entire neighbourhood (the
local police force, the local priest, I
mean everyone) to hear that things
would be different this year.
That was courtesy of Blair decid-
ing she would spend the festive
season with her friends at school,
rather than with the folks. Quick
thinking Luther decides it’s time
to live a little (away from the cold)
by taking his wife on a Caribbean
cruise during the Christmas period
instead of slaving away preparing
for the usual party.
The implications: no tree, no
gifts, no Mr Snowman, but plenty
of angry neighbours doing all in
their power to make the Kranks feel
bad. Luther decides to fight back,
until Blair does a U-turn at the last
minute and decides to come home
for Christmas.
Mum and Dad’s holiday plans are
bust. With only 12 hours left before
Blair arrives, they must quickly plan
their usual Christmas.
This film is typical of Hollywood’s
fantasy Christmas offerings – the
background Christmas music, the
carol singing neighbours and the
snow, to name just a few things.
The plot does not appear to be very
practical in everyday life. It’s very
lightweight and predictable. This
film will certainly not be shaking
the seats of the Oscar bosses. So if
you are looking for a film that will
have you gripped from beginning to
a month after the end, don’t bother
with this one.
I feel the only element that car-
ries this film is the all-star line up.
Tim Allen is an impressive actor
and the on-screen chemistry with
Jamie Lee Curtis is undeniable.
Former Ghostbusters actor Dan
Ackroyd does well in portraying the
ringleader of the angry neighbours
doing their best to stir things up,
cracking the usual jokes that have
made him the actor we all know
and love.
However, I won’t write off this film
entirely. There are a number of clas-
sic moments to savour. I won’t spoil
it all for you too much. All I’ll say
is: botox, Tim Allen, serious fake
tan, Hickory Ham and a frozen cat.
There is also some candy guy in the
shape of Blair’s Latino boyfriend,
Enrique.
All in all, this is a feel-good comedy
that should lift your mood. Ideally
it’s a good film for your younger
siblings, but it’s not worth getting
“cranked” up about if you miss it.

Now what on earth could go wrong now?
“This film will
certainly not be
shaking the seats of
the Oscar bosses”
History... Hollywood style. No change there then
Shakespeare isn’t something you’d
expect to be made into a film these
days – too many long words I guess
– but miraculously this one was
green lighted for production.
On paper, this seems an interest-
ing film, with Al Pacino and Jeremy
Irons delivering amazing perform-
ances, and some familiar faces in
Mackenzie Crook (The Office) and
Kris Marshall (My Family). All this
not forgetting it was written by one
of history’s greatest playwrights.
Al Pacino plays Shylock, a Venetian
Jew who lends money to Antonio
(Irons). Bear with me here – Antonio
isn’t actually borrowing money for
himself but for his friend (although
he’d like him to be a bit more than
that) Bassanio. Bassanio wants to
sail to Belmont to try to woo Portia.
Bitter at Antonio’s insults, Shylock
stipulates very specific terms if a
default on the loan occurs. The loan
falls due and Shylock claims his
forfeit: a pound of Antonio’s flesh.
Nice. To aggravate the situation,
Shylock’s daughter elopes with her
lover and a sizable chunk of her
father’s wealth.
The acting can’t be faulted; howev-
er, neither can it be praised – a bit of
a non-event, really – but Al Pacino’s
melancholy presence makes up for
this and he dominates the film even
after his exit. His portrayal of the
moneylender is a sensitive one; he
is both victim and villain. One of the
best scenes is his rendition of the
iconic “If you prick us, do we not
bleed?” speech, which is guaranteed
to make you sit up and pay attention
in an otherwise slow paced, dull film.
Irons does well in portraying the
homoerotic undertones in Antonio
and Bassanio’s relationship... but
sadly that’s all I can think of to sell
the film to you.
Radford could have done much
more with the direction, but the
scenes were poorly shot and loosely
linked to each other – it just didn’t
gel. The film had the potential to be
visually spectacular with Radford
sticking to the 16th century theme
and shooting in Venetian locations.
However, what you’re given is some-
thing that is quite oppressive and
ugly to look at. It looked as if it were
a substandard B-grade TV movie
rather than something for the big
screen. Perhaps the use of the dark
and dank canals was a metaphor for
the play’s blurred moral world. All
I can say is that nothing stood out.
Maybe that’s why I found myself fall-
ing asleep during the film. Might I
add that this has never happened to
me before – I desperately wanted to
like The Merchant of Venice, having
loved reading it in school, but just
couldn’t.
This film may conjure unhappy
memories of GCSE English for
some, although it would fill in the
parts you fell asleep through. What
was particularly annoying was
Radford’s repeated failure to make
use of the play as an analogy for
world events today which so easily
could have been done – one of the
main themes is revenge and oppres-
sion. After all, Shylock’s main moti-
vation for terrorising Antonio is the
appalling treatment he suffered as
a Jew. Radford could have empha-
sized this, but instead he focuses on
the romantic aspect of the play, pos-
sibly to satisfy a wider and presum-
ably brainless audience, or to avoid
controversy.
The end result? A film that lacks
any visual style or personality that
you may have expected after seeing
Romeo and Juliet. It’s long – way too
long – and goes torturously slowly.
Do not go to see this film if you want
something easy on the mind, as you
will need to pay a lot of attention to
understand it. Although Al Pacino’s
performance is great, I’d advise you
all to wait until it’s released on DVD
– you won’t be missing out on much.
