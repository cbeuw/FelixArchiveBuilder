INTERVIEW
Regular readers may recall that pre-
viously I have enthused about the
merits of DJ and former Imperial
student Ian Betts and his produc-
tion Love Resurrection. I invited
Ian back to College to find out how
you go from being an Imperial
graduate to one of the most talked
about names in the London trance
scene with bookings from here to
Thailand.
FELIX: Welcome back then!
How are you?
IAN BETTS: Very well thanks! But
pretty busy. With a full time job,
DJing and the production stuff
always on the go, it can get a bit
hectic, but I can’t really complain.
Nice of you to spare us the
time then. You were here a
while ago weren’t you?
Yeah, from ’89 to ’92, I did geology in
the RSM. I think I’ve been back once
since I graduated, that was about
ten years ago.
Notice anything different?
Not really. It all looks remarkably
similar to back then. The [Beit]
Quad is a bit tidier and looks like
it might have had a bit of a paint,
and there used to be a games room
where those toilets are, but this [the
Union Bar] looks almost exactly as
I remember it, and I knew it quite
well! There’s also that big white
frame thing on the road up here.
The Tanaka Business School.
Oh right. That wasn’t there when I
was here. It doesn’t quite look fin-
ished...?
Strange you should say that.
So, you did geology, and now
you’re a world famous DJ. Not
exactly a common career path
is it?
It’s not quite like that. I only really
DJ part time. During the day I’m
an IT consultant for an American
bank. I left uni with a massive debt
and ended up getting a job in a meat
factory to pay it off. While I was
there I bought myself a computer
and taught myself IT and it kind of
developed from there. The DJing
came much later. And I wouldn’t say
‘world famous’.
So what were you like as an
undergraduate?
Many drunken nights spent in
Southside, and RSM bar nights on
Wednesdays with the chaps and
their drinking games.
Good grief, things really
haven’t changed!
Ha ha, probably not, no. I was into
my indie and rock stuff back then
too, I almost got involved with Felix
and the radio station, but I never got
round to it. I played drums and gui-
tar in a band though, and we used
to practise in the basement of the
Union in this dingy little room with
grotty carpets and a smoky kind of
stench.
Were you any good? What
were you called?
We were called (hangs head in
shame) Easy Meat.
Easy Meat?!
I know, I know, it wasn’t my choice,
I was out-voted three to one. But
we weren’t that bad, we played a
headline gig at the Mean Fiddler
once and the Garage another time.
We split up after a year or two when
one of the guitarists went to Cardiff,
and then I joined another, more
folky band. The music background
probably helped with picking up the
DJing.
So how did you get into trance
if you were an indie kid?
Well dance music didn’t really exist
when I started uni and it only began
to pick up after I left. Basically,
when I was working at the factory,
some of the guys went to a bar one
evening and then just said “Hey,
lets go to a club”. We went along, it
just clicked with me, and I’ve never
looked back!
What about the DJing?
That was even later. I had been buy-
ing records for a while, all the stuff I
was hearing out at the weekends, I’d
buy it just because I loved it. I had
no intention of playing it seriously,
DJing never crossed my mind, I just
had a basic turntable. And then it
got to a stage where we thought that
the scene had changed too much,
the clubs weren’t as good as they
were in the old days etc.
Some things really don’t
change then?
Exactly. So they said to me, you’ve
got a load of records, why don’t
you start playing? It seemed like a
reasonable idea so I bought myself
a pair of belt-driven hi-fi turntables
and taught myself to mix on those. It
was only a hobby back then though,
I never considered taking it any fur-
ther, didn’t dream of it. But I picked
it up, and about three years later in
’99 I started my own promotion so
that I could start to play out to real
people.
And it all kicked off from
there?
Not at all. Like I said, back then it
was just a bit of fun, literally a hobby.
It only really started to gather any
momentum about 18 months ago.
I was made redundant just before
that, and I got a pretty decent redun-
dancy package, so I decided to buy a
load of new kit. I got myself set up
with a studio at home, bought myself
some proper decks and started
getting gigs and doing it more
seriously. Around March last
year, I played a gig for Heat at
Turnmills and Steve Hill [Kiwi leg-
end, DJ, producer, record label
boss] was there, as well as Damo
[HeatUK head honcho]. I played
Love Resurrection as my first tune
and the place absolutely went off,
Steve ran into the booth asking what
it was, and when I told him it was my
own tune he immediately wanted it
for his new record label and called
me every day for the next week ask-
ing about it.
And that’s when it all kicked
off?
Oh yeah! Damo loved the set as well
and I got asked back to play a few
more gigs for Heat, I started play-
ing out on a more regular basis, my
name got around and I was asked to
be the other Heat resident back in
February.
And now you’re one of the big-
gest trance DJs in London.
Ha ha! People always say this to
me, but I honestly don’t see it. It’s
really strange, like being in the eye
of the storm where everything is
just going on around you. I guess
because it’s happened so gradually
and I never really intended it to take
off, I haven’t noticed anything that
different.
Oh come on! Heat resident
[they only have two], headline
sets for Twisted, Cream at Am-
nesia in Ibiza, tunes played on
Radio 1... you aren’t exactly
‘local’ any more.
Those things were all astonishing.
I did a three hour headline set for
Twisted at the Fridge, and it baffled
me. I fully expected no-one to turn
up and the place was absolutely
rammed, I suppose that’s when I
started to think “Hmmm, maybe
there’s something in this?”
The Amnesia gig came about
because Heat were doing a week
of co-promotions out there. Damo
suggested me to Cream, I sent them
a demo and they booked me for the
opening set. I played before Armin
van Buuren!
What was that like?
Strange. I was perfectly fine for the
whole day and directly before the
gig, people kept asking me if I was
nervous but I actually wasn’t. I knew
what I was doing, why would I be?
It all went great, it started off with
a couple of hundred people there
whose faces I mostly knew, which
was nice. By the end there were a
few thousand people there. Armin
liked it, I had a chat with him, shook
his hand, all fairly usual, and then I
left the DJ booth. All of a sudden I
realised what I’d just done, that I’d
just finished playing to five thousand
people in the best club in the world
and they’d loved it. I stood by the
bar for about two hours in an utter
daze, just staring around, not really
knowing what to do. I had to leave, it
was too much to take in. That whole
experience is definitely the pinnacle
so far!
And then there was Love
Resurrection...
Indeed. I’d had the idea for a while,
and then when I got my studio I had
the chance to give it a go. People
seemed to love it, and because I only
gave it to a very few select people,
it was mostly me who played it so it
became associated with me, which
probably helped. It finally went to
press a couple of weeks ago. 750
were printed and it sold out in about
10 days apparently. I think we’re
going to get another 750 done, it’s
been licensed to a couple of MoS
type compilations in South Africa
and they use it in most of the jingles
on their equivalent of Radio 1, and
as you say, you can get it in HMV
Japan.
Not to mention Radio 1 in this
country...
That was also awesome. I’d played
at Knowwhere on the Friday night
just before Dave Pearce and used it
as my last tune. As usual the reac-
tion was incredible, he noticed, so
I gave him a copy, rather hopefully.
Then on Sunday night I was driving
home listening to Dance Anthems,
I was about a mile from home and
I heard the beat coming in, I went
crazy, I had to pull over and catch
my breath until it finished, it was
incredible.
You did some radio work your-
self didn’t you?
Well, I did a show on [internet radio
station] TranceAirwaves for a while.
I sent them an email and demo
asking if they wanted any DJs,
and they said yes. Sadly it doesn’t
exist anymore, those kind of things
cost money, especially when you’re
streaming terabytes of data, and
they just weren’t getting the invest-
ment needed. It’s a shame because
internet radio is a fantastic resource
and I think it is definitely the way
forward. The potential audiences
are huge and it’s mush easier to get
internet radio going than a proper
radio station.
So what have you got lined up
for next year?
Well, I’m going back to do a small
tour of Australia some time, a few
dates around Sydney, Melbourne,
Perth. Apparently there’s already a
buzz and they expect tickets for a
boat party to sell out pretty quickly.
I’m going to Thailand to do a Full
Moon party for Heat, there’s a big
outdoor event in Cape Town with a
4000 people arena that I’ll probably
be doing and Steve [Hill] is always
on the look out for stuff in Oz and
NZ. They’ve asked me back to Ibiza
next season.
Any chance of seeing you in
this country?
Ha ha! Of course. I’m playing the
main room at Brixton Academy
for New Years Eve with Heat and
The Gallery, plus there’s the Heat
Christmas Party at KoKo [formerly
Camden Palace] this Friday which
is going to be awesome. They’ve
completely refurbished CP and it
looks so plush, all the Heat DJs
will be there, the atmosphere will
be fantastic and it’s just going to be
brilliant. If you get there early there
will be some tickets on the door. I’m
also taking bookings for April and
May already, there’s Heat Evolution
in January as well as Knowwhere
that month. Heat have some mas-
sive things planned for next year,
things that will blow what they’ve
done so far out of the water, so look
out for those.
So you’re planning on running
with the DJ thing? Don’t fancy
heading back into promotion?
Not really, now the DJing is working
nicely I think I’ll stick with it. I’m
still going to be doing a lot of pro-
duction work too, there’s about five
things in the pipeline, I’m back off
home now to get in the studio with
Marc [French, Heat DJ] and there
may be a Heat LP sometime next
year too.
Any advice for the kids that
want to get into DJing?
It’s clichéd I know, but it really is
all about practise, practise as much
as possible, and try to be differ-
ent. Promoters hear hundreds of
demos a week so you have to stand
out – playing anthems will get you
nowhere. Do your own productions,
remix stuff, be different. These days,
about 75% of what I play is either
my own original work or remixes/
reworks that I’ve done. And talk to
them, go to their events and get to
know them. They are more likely to
respond to you if they see you out
and about than if you just send them
a CD and never follow it up.
OK then, finally, what did you
think of the DJ Mag Top 100?
I think this year’s results show just
how global the poll is now, and the
growing popularity of dance music
in America. I also think a lot of
DJs place too much importance on
making it into the list – the Top 10
is pretty much impenetrable at the
moment. The DJs got where they
are through hard work but they have
also turned themselves into widely
recognisable ‘brands’ and so will
always feature highly in such polls.
I do respect PvD and Ferry Corsten
because they are consistently good,
and Ferry is one of the most innova-
tive producers around. The list does
highlight which genres are most
popular though; trance is that big
outside London, it’s up there with
house, even in England, you don’t
find many hard dance clubs outside
London.
Thanks very much for taking
the time to speak to us. Any-
thing else you’d like to add?
Just that it’s the KoKo club this
weekend and then Heat NYE at
Brixton, tickets are selling fast so if
you fancy coming along then I sug-
gest you get in there quick.
