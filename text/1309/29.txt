Here’s a festive treat for you: not
quite a jumbo puzzle, but perhaps
a bumper one. The unclued entry
at 22 across is thematic, but don’t
be scared – there’s not much of a
theme, and it’s pretty obvious. 4
down is obscure, but can be easily
verified online.
A final note about clue types, to
wrap up the present series of col-
umns. Some clues, known as ‘&Lits’
(‘and literally so’), are so ingenious
that their cryptic wordplay doubles
up as the definition. These are dif-
ficult to think up and hence rare, but
perhaps the most satisfying of all.
You’ll find one here at 13 across.
That’s all folks – see you next
term! Snufkin
