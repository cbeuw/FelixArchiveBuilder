Donald Braben paints a sorry pic-
ture of the current state of scientific
research. He asserts that without
radical changes to the way it is
funded, motivated and practised,
civilisation itself is under threat.
Braben lays out his thesis effec-
tively in the introduction, drawing
the reader to commit to the book
and his ideas. He explains that
while science and technology are
the basis of civilisation, they are
taken for granted – the source of the
advances that have transformed our
world is rarely considered. Now this
source – truly innovative research –
is threatened by widespread obses-
sions with safety, control and pre-
dictability. “Humanity has reached
a crucial point in its development.”
Despite the early promise of the
introduction, the opening chapters
are sadly rather awkward. Braben
takes too long developing his defini-
tion of ‘dissent’, the tendency to find
the status quo unbearable and hope
for and plan future improvements.
He sees this as the unique and
defining character of the human
animal, the key to its success.
The ‘back of an envelope’ account
of human history, from the evolu-
tion of Homo erectus to the indus-
trial revolution, is also hard going.
Despite acknowledging that better
histories of humanity are in no short
supply (Jared Diamond’s excellent
Guns, Germs, Steel is one that is
recommended), Braben proceeds
nonetheless.
I have to admit that the ardour
of your intrepid reviewer wavered
somewhat after the opening chap-
ters. Fortunately things soon get
back on track; Braben is far more
authoritative and interesting when
writing on the problems posed by
the success of science, the failings
of science policy and his proposed
solutions.
Historically, researchers gener-
ally worked alone or in very small
groups, and were self-directed.
At the turn of the 20th century,
this began to change, industrial-
ists grouped together researchers
to create new opportunities, and
governments soon also developed
research infrastructures to sustain
their industrial societies.
The result was sustained suc-
cess – industrial development and
economic growth continued apace.
Economists dub the period covering
the fifties, sixties and early seven-
ties as ‘the golden age’ of economic
growth, and technology advanced
rapidly during this time. However,
subsequently, science became a vic-
tim of its own success.
The number of working scientists
increased greatly, and this pre-
sented the authorities with the twin
problems of which research to fund,
and how to fund it. Braben pins the
cause of the crisis facing research
and humanity on the policies used
to allocate funding in an ever more
crowded profession. Governments
and industry alike have sought to
maximise the effectiveness of their
resources, allocating on the basis of
projected return from their invest-
ment in research.
Unfortunately research is an
inherently unpredictable business.
Few of the most important and
influential scientific breakthroughs
could ever have been forecast by
any committee. An investment in
research is like no other.
Braben’s theory is that we should
stop second-guessing research and
do away with bureaucratic obses-
sions with safety and control: “The
geese that lay the golden eggs are
increasingly being farmed and
focused, it is no wonder that our
magical geese have become egg-
bound in recent times.” He claims
that a drastic overhaul of the way
that research is funded and man-
aged will fix this problem. More
novel products of research will drive
economic growth and safeguard
humanity.
Braben has a powerful example of
his ideas in action, in BP’s Venture
Research Unit, of which he was
founder and chairman. During the
1980s, the oil giant ploughed mil-
lions of pounds into this initiative.
The intention was to identify sci-
entists with the sort of innovative
ideas that would not usually get
funded. The usual lengthy goal-
motivated, peer-reviewed proposals
were scrapped. The novelty of the
science was paramount and face-to-
face discussion with applicants was
used. Despite successful and unim-
agined new findings by almost all
the recipients of Venture Research
funding, a change of management
at BP in 1989 led to the closure of
the Unit.
The book can be characterised
as one side of a discussion on the
future of science. The continued
expansion of professional science
has led to the development of
bizarre bureaucracies to allocate
resources. Researchers find them-
selves having to play the game to
these rules and this will necessarily
impact the nature of the research
carried out. Braben’s book does a
worthy job of highlighting these
issues, and how they have arisen,
but the solutions he suggests are
not the only ones. There is undeni-
ably a situation to be dealt with,
but many possible interpretations
and solutions. Braben’s reasoning
and his Venture Research Initiative
illustrates a possible route, but oth-
ers surely exist.
This book is a stimulating read.
Hopefully it will kindle wider dis-
cussion of the way that research is
managed and how more of those
elusive golden eggs can be found to
the gain of humanity.
