Linstead Hall — Rents up hut meals stay the same.
Council beaten as
Union backs changes
The eagerly awaited I.C.
Union meeting to discuss the
proposed constitutional re-
forms opened last Thursday.
About 430 students packed
into Mech. Eng. 220 and in
a meeting lasting nearly
three hours voted in a num-
ber of important constitu-
tional changes. After throw-
ing out the council document
the meeting based discussion
on the original working
party report. Before the
Rents Shock - U.G.C.
force increase in
Hall Rents
At the last meeting of the
Residence Committee, it was
decided to increase Hall rents
by 20% from the beginning
of next session. The reason
for this large increase is two-
fold: According to the esti-
mates for the present session,
it is expected that there will
be a deficit of £5,680. To
cover this deficit next year
an increase of 8|% in all
rents will be needed.
U.G.C.
The major increase is due
to a letter from the U.G.C.
stating that the Halls them-
selves must be responsible
for meeting the cost of mes-
sengers, security guards and
the salaries of the Clerks to
the Halls. In the past the Col-
lege has met these costs, al-
though most London Univer-
sity Halls do charge these
items to the Hall rents. The
increased cost to the Halls
will be in the region of
£12,000 making a total defi-
cit of about £18,000, which
can be met only by a mini-
mum of 20% increase in
rents.
The increase will not affect
Student House residents,
whose rents will remain the
same. As far as Linstead
Hall is concerned, the in-
crease is on the room charge
alone, and the dining in
charge will remain at 7/6d.
In Garden Hall, the rents
payed for double and treble
rooms will be adjusted so as
to compare more favourably
with the cost of a single
room, although the average
increase will be 20%,
Comparisons
In its report recommending
the increases, the Sub-Com-
mittee obtained the compar-
able rents for other Univer-
sity Halls. After allowing for
is
(the cost of meals, which
included in some London
Hall rents, and adding 20%
to the present I.C. hall rents
it was found that other rents
varied between £93 and £122,
with the majority around
£108. With the 20% in-
crease a room in a new I.C.
hall will cost £97.4 and one
in Beit old Hostel £86.8.
Conferences
An investigation is going
to be made into the possi-
bility of cutting down on the
amount of cleaning in Halls.
The stumbling block here is
that all the cleaners are
needed for vacation confer-
ences, which contribute -J- of
the total income of £81,000,
where visitors pay around
35/- per night, and so expect
a complete cleaning service.
A cut in the wage bill might
result in a cut in Conference
income, without very much
total gain.
meeting adjourned until
Tuesday (see FELICITY) it
was decided to elect the
President, Deputy President
and Secretary by a college-
wide ballot and the size of
council was increased by the
addition of 11 departmental
reps and an Academic
Officer.
Rex Lowin opened the
meeting quietly enough, the
minutes being taken as read.
Arising from this it was an-
nounced that the new milk
machine had been sent back,
Council had reversed its de-
cision not to give Mr. Garby,
the former FELIX printer, a
gift. The Rector had an-
nounced a working party of
3 staff and 3 students
(Lowin, Bland and Collinge),
chaired by a nominated Gov-
ernor, to discuss disciplinary
procedures, including ICU's
total opposition to a double-
punishment.
Resignations
The first excitement came
when the letters of resigna-
tion of the working party
members, who wished to pre-
sent their report to the
Union, were read. John
Hunt, a floor rep on coun-
cil, also had written a letter
Martin Bland proposing that the original report of the
Working Party be discussed by the Union Meeting.
of resignation. Hunt felt out
of sympathy with Union
members over the LSE mot-
ion and also complained of
councils "petty politics" over
the constitution.
Following a letter describ-
ing Council's treatment of
the working party report on
the constitution, Martin
Bland, working party chair-
man, moved a motion pro-
posing that the working
party report be taken as the
basis of discussion. Bland
stated that the working party
had taken two terms to
reach a compromise consti-
tution based on informed
consultations; Council on
the other hand had made
their own constitution in two
hours. Opposing, Dermott
Corr attacked the way the
working party had worked
and suggested among mount-
ing interruptions from the
floor, that their report was
not considered enough, Dave
Wield, seconding the motion,
disputed Corr's allegations
and pointed out that Council
had diluted the report, some-
thing better left to a Union
meeting. A newly shaven
Chris Parker rose to urge a
by now impatient meeting to
accept the council report as
more representative, and ap-
peared to claim the motion
was a vote of no confidence
in Council. A show of hands
was all that was needed to
defeat council and back the
working-party by 233 votes
to 159 against.
Marathon
Martin Bland then began
a marathon proposal of the
working-party's recommend-
ed new constitution. Pink-
shirted Bland first outlined
the philosophy behind the
report; the ebullient SCC
chairman called for more
service to students by ICU,
increased communication
and greater co-ordination
and activity in academic
affairs.
