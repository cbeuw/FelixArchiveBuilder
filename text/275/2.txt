Last year's Deputy President getting the bucket at the fete
Recent meetings of Carni-
val Committee and Board
have been concerned with
what can be done to improve
our charity total for this year
and working out a format for
next year's Carnival.
As far as this year's Car-
nival is concerned, a lot of
assistance is wanted by the
organiser of the fete on May
10th, Sue Lowin. The Com-
mittee have located two
pianos for the piano smash-
ing and a source for some of
the crockery needed for the
plate bashing stall, but help
will be needed to collect these
things and the assistance
needed on the day of the
fete will be quite substantial.
Looking forward to next
year, the Committee have
proposed many ideas about
the form the Carnival appeal
should take, including the
idea that it should be divided
into three periods: a collect-
ing week, a stunts week and
something similar to next
term's Arts Festival.
Much of the discussion has
centred, however, on the
failures of this year and what
jobs will need to be done to
avoid the mistakes of this
year. The three major posts
will again be co-ordinator,
(secretary and junior treasl-
urer. The co-ordinator is
elected by the Carnival Board
which consists of all the
Union Presidents and the
vice-president and secretary
of ICU. All nominations for
this position should be sent
to the secretary of ICU with
one p r o p o s e r and five
seconders, all members of the
Union, not later than Mon-
day 28th April.
After this, the co-ordinator
will be free to choose his
committee and sub-commit-
tees. These will total some-
thing in the region of 60
people. In the past, Carnival
committees have suffered
from being 'cliquey'. This
was unavoidable, since the
co-ordinator did not have
enough time to wander
through the college looking
for likely people and was thus
obliged to choose those he
knew and could rely on. It is
hoped that it will be possible
to prevent this for next year
by advertising the posts now.
The committee posts will
be secretary, junior treasurer,
raffle organiser, concert or-
ganiser, Carnival Queen com-
petition organiser, a stunts
organiser, the fete organiser,
a public relations officer to
deal with all aspects of Carni-
val outside College, the Arts
Festival organiser, a publicity
officer and a Carnival pub-
lications officer to co-ordinate
the production of magazines,
records and so on. Apart
from these, the three con-
stituent College vice - presi-
dents sit on the committee
and it is suggested that there
should be an ICWA rep (pre-
ferably the President) or
FELIX rep and a rep from
Ents. Any external colleges
joining our rag would also be
invited to appoint officers to
the committee. This would
make the committee about 20
strong.
There is no point in pre-
tending that these jobs will
not require a lot of work,
although it is hoped that it
will not reach the proportions
that this year's committee
suffered. Ian larvis feels,
however, that from experi-
ence say that the jobs are
extremely rewarding. The
amount of work they require
will depend entirely on the
amount of assistance the
officers receive. The majority
of them will need to form
their own sub-committees.
The 'fringe' jobs will include
someone to keep tabs on col-
lecting tins and moneys, sales
organisers for the raffles, a
dozen 'Ents - minded' people
to help with the concert(s),
an enthusiastic group to help
with the organisation of
stunts and possibly most im-
portant of all someone to
handle publicity in each of
the clearly defined events—
fete, Carnival Queen compe-
tition and so on.
The publications officer's
job will mostly be to keep
tabs on what's going on with
the items being produced. It
is felt essential that next
year a magazine should be
produced and, if at all pos-
sible, a record as well. Both
these will require a fairly
dedicated and imaginative
group to make good use of
them.
Ian Jarvis feels there is no
reason at all why anyone in-
volved in Carnival should
have so much work to do
that he becomes disenchanted
or fails his exams. If all the
jobs outlined above are filled,
everyone will have plenty of
time to make a tremendous
success of his particular
event, enjoy it and have the
satisfaction of being part of
the most successful Carnival
this College has ever spen. No
matter how little or how
much someone wants to do,
there is a job on Carnival for
him.
If you would like to help
next year, you are asked to
drop a note into the Carnival
Office as soon as possible,
letting the Committee know
what particular field you are
interested in.
N.B. Don't forget the fete
on May 10th. (Rumour has it
there may be a white slave
market!)
Non-Technical Studies
For a number of years,
some engineers in the college
have been able to study non-
technical subjects as part of
their degree. A survey held
this term also revealed a con-
siderable demand in R.C.S.
for the introduction of sub-
sidiary courses in the human-
ities, social sciences and
languages.
Following an initiative
from the College Committee
for Sociological Studies, on
which the academic affairs
representatives of the three
constituent colleges sit, a
questionnaire has been cir-
culated to quantify the
demand throughout I.C. for
courses of this nature, with a
view to establishing them as
options (carrying degree
credit if necessary). The
academic affairs representa-
tives, Jon Shields, Graham
Burton and Barry Hood, are
appealing for the question-
naires to be completed and
returned as soon as possible.
Copies of the questionnaire
are still available and the
results will be out very
shortly.
Changes at the top
With the publication of
this issue, we pass a mile-
stone in the history of jour-
nalism. Paul Heath, editor of
FELIX since last October,
ends his dynamic career as a
student journalist and retires
to the innermost depths of
B e i t H a l l to start his
academic career free from the
artificial melee of student
politics. His b r i e f, but
glorious, reign at the pin-
nacle of the communication
media has turned him into a
chain - smoking, alcoholic,
nervous wreck.
To succeed him, in the
summer term we have the
volatile Les Ebdon, one of
the few remaining hot gospel-
ling revolutionaries of the
non-conformist Middle Ages
revolt against the Pope. Next
Autumn we see the beginning
of Malcolm Williamson's
editorship. Up to now a little
cog in a big machine, 'ego
trip', as he is known to his
few remaining friends, can
be expected to . . . .

The season of elections is already upon us and Mines
and RCS have now elected Presidents for next session. The
RCS election being by general Union ballot will interest those
studying form for the ICU Presidential election (provided of
course there are no shocks at the first Union meeting of next
term). The old maxim that a candidate must carry his own
department was seen in operation once again. Chris Kent's
large defeat was inevitable from the day that early canvass
returns showed he had little support in his own Mathematics
department. It would appear that there was an anti-vote
against Kent as John Butterworth collected 64 Maths votes
to beat Kent's 57. Butty took Zoology overwhelmingly by
35 votes to nil. Botany and Silwood Park also backed Butty
strongly. The vital Physios vote split 3 to 1 in favour of Butty
and Chemistry 2 to 1.
The Vice-Presidential elections are of more interest to
the budding psychologists because of the closeness of the vote.
Steve Morrisby in fact won all the departments except Physics.
However his failure to mobilise grass-roots support in
Chemistry, where he beat Barry Pywell by 87 votes to 24 on
a low poll meant that he lost the election when Pywell
romped home in Physics with 185 votes against 41 for
Morrisby.
A point which might interest potential ICU Secretary
and Deputy-President candidates is that if there had been an
alliance among any four of the candidates the voting might
have been very different. For instance Butty would have
offered the Bot-Zoo-Silwood vote to a running mate, Morrisby
Chemistry and most obviously of all Pywell's name on the
ticket might have given the Physics vote. Perhaps the biggest
advantage would have been that the number of abstentions
in the Vice-Presidential elections might have been reduced,
for 141 abstained here against 59 in the Presidential election
—a significant number when compared with a majority of
only 38.
Good to see the great increase in paper communications
around the college. Pete Dowlin's RCS Broadsheet is probably
well known to RCS men and the RSM, in response to demand
from first years, is now following suit. Some people may
have heard of the independent broadsheet of the left, CEFE,
(Current Evens—Future Events) add to this Father Ivor's, by
now, hardy perennial, "Chi-Rho" and on another plane
"Beeno" and we begin to see just how much is being pub-
lished. It would be a pity if ICU did not respond to all this
grass-roots journalism and consider whether its limited
duplicating facilities are adequate.
REX
This week our President writes on the alter-
natives to our present examination system.
Research into Teaching Methods is nowadays an
accepted subject in education, but the companion study of
Examination Methods is still very much in its infancy. Many
different examination methods have now been devised and
there can be any combination of written or oral, memory or
open book, and fixed time or open ended examinations. In
addition to this, there has always been the choice of asking
book work questions or problems and the alternatives of
of frequent tests or yearly examinations. This list is by no
means comprehensive but it does illustrate some of the oppor-
tunities which examiners are now realising.
In recent years there has been both a great increase in
the number of alternatives used to test students and a sug-
gestion to use several different methods on any one course.,
What has not been generally realized is that an arbitary
mixture of methods is not necessarily the final, or best,
solution. A great deal of research is needed, by educational
experts, to find out just what qualities each of these methods
really measure. Only then is it possible to determine what
abilities examinations ought to measure and how the right
mixture can be obtained.
Different people may have vastly differing abilities in
memory, understanding and original thought and it seems
that eventually some method of assessing students separately
in each of such categories will have to be used. A breakdown
like this would be harder to achieve but it would be much
more useful than the present simple class divisions of a degree
—and also much fairer.
