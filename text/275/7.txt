IC Snatch Castaways Cup
A week-end of cold but
tame easterly winds brought
some of the best perfor-
mances of the year from the
college's two sailing teams.
Saturday morning saw the
old clubhouse bursting at
the seams trying to accom-
modate the 21 teams rep-
resenting every constituent
part of the University. The
first had little difficulty in
disposing of U.C. II and
Guy's Hospital. As a result
of an absent team and a
bye the second's did not take
to the water till 4 p.m. when,
suitably bloated with steak
pies and beans they found
their own wind and crossed
the line a lap in front of
their opponents.
Sunday supplied the more
serious competition of the
Cup. In the first race cf the
semi - finals our second's
had a spectacular victory
over U.C. I but failed to
make the final by a quarter
of a point. The honour of
the College was, however,
admirably upheld by the All
Stars despite a slight mis-
judgment on behalf of one
helmsman who was dis-
qualified for trying to sail
through the opposition
rather than round them. In
the final race I.C. showed
their superior boat speed
and in the lengthening even-
ing shadows crossed the
finishing line to bring the
Cup back to the college for
the first time in 6 years,
much to the dismay of St.
Thomas's Hospital.
Teams: John Pattisson,
Ken Barker; Nick Martin,
Pat Tiere; P. Claydon, John
Pollard.

man; J. Brown, M . Gilligan.
KEN BARKER
Tech.
Cup
RCS defeated Guilds 3-2
in the final game in this
year's Tech Cup and thus
won the cup, preventing a
guilds hat - trick into the
bargain. Both teams had to
make late changes in their
line-ups, Guilds being the
more seriously affected.
RCS opened strongly and
after 15 minutes were two
up through Darley and Hor-
lock. Guilds slowly began to
recover from this early set-
back and in the last twenty
minutes of this half played
some good football. RCS
defended well, however, par-
ticularly Mountford, a last-
minute substitute in their
side.
The second half began
sensationally. From Guilds
kick-off, McCardle hit a long
ball from the centre for Keer
to push into the RCS goal
to make it 2-1. Play began
to become scrappy but
Guilds were fighting hard
for an equaliser. They
finally scored again, 10
minutes from the end, when
Clarke hit a great shot from
just inside the area. RCS
recovered well from this set-
back and scored the winning
goal three minutes from the
end; Kelly hit a lovely
centre from the right and
Darley, running in, headed
his second goal. RCS had
won a deserved if somewhat
surprised victory.
Golf Club Victory
I.C. golf club had a very
successful day last Wednes-
day when it won the team
prize in the South East Uni-
versities Golf league 36 hole
Stroke Play Championships.
The team was: G. B. F. Hen-
ney, R. C. R. Lee, N . Good-
all, and D. Leaper. The aver-
age score of 82 for the four
players was exceedingly good
considering the state of the
course and the weather.
There were also individual
successes:— G. Henney won
the individual scratch prize
with two rounds of 78, 74.
winning by 7 strokes, and D.
Leaper came second in the
Handicap competition, and
was unfortunate not to win,
being penalised 1 shot for
driving off the wrong tee.
The golf club has only
played 2 matches this term,
both against Southampton
University. In the first we
lost, for the first time this
year, while in the second we
drew 3-3. The club has still
not had any joy in its search
for a new home, but we
hope to have some more
cheerful news on this subject
at the start of next term.
Badminton
The club has had only a
moderately successful season
in its league matches. With
most of last year's players
leaving, the poor influx of
freshers was not strong en-
ough to maintain the usual
good standard of badminton
at I.C.
In the league matches, the
first team won 5 and lost 5,
the 2nds won 7 and lost 3,
with 3 walkovers, the 3rds
won 3 but lost 6, the mixed
team won 8 for the loss of 2,
while the ladies with one
walkover won 5 and lost 1.
Although placings have not
yet been announced, it is un-
likely that any team will be
highly placed, except perhaps
the Ladies and the mixed
teams.
The ladies are in fact our
most dependable team, and
were very successful in the
U.L. Tournament. Lynne
Beynan won the ladies
singles title, and along with
capain Rosanne Date also
took the doubles title. Lynne
has also to be congratulated
for her selection for the Bri-
tish Universities Sports Fed-
eration Badminton Club tour
of Europe this Easter,
With the possible demoli-
tion of Nine Elms Baths and
the inadequacies of the
Union gym for match play,
the club must seek new
courts.
R.C.S. defeat Guilds
to win Sparkes Cup
By beating Guilds 6-3 last
Wednesday the R.C.S. first
X V won the Sparkes Cup
for 1969, leaving Guilds and
Mines only the Engineers
Cup to contest.
The pitch was atrocious
after two days of heavy rain
but at least there was no
standing water. The game
began with Guilds on top
territorially, but with
neither side looking like
scoring until a very smooth
breakaway from within
their own half by the R.C.S.
backs gave Kip Connolly a
good try.
Guilds still kept up the
pressure and were justly re-
warded near the end of the
first half when Bell prised
out the ball from a loose
scrum near the R.C.S. line
and slipped a good pass
to Pine coming up at speed
who crashed his way over
to score.
The second half began
much the same as the first,
and with Guilds taking even
more possession and terri-
tory. However R.C.S. stuck
resolutely to their job, and
despite two disallowed tries
Guilds just could not score.
Finally on the stroke of full
time a good passing move-
ment along the R.C.S. line
gave Marsh some room to
move and to speed in for
a try of remarkable quality
for these conditions.
So R.C.S. having beaten
Mines 5-0 and now Guilds
6-3 won the cup.
In the second X V game
R.C.S. again squeezed a
narrow win through a try
by Everett.
The Sparkes cup will be
presented at the rugby club
dinner today (March 20th).
There is still time to buy a
ticket for this culinary,
oratory and alcoholic ex-
travaganza.

Injury-hit I.C.
win London Cross
Country title
Imperial College finished
the season on a high note
by winning the London
Colleges' Cross Country
League. The final race was
held last Wednesday at St.
Mary's College, Twicken-
ham. The course was over
five miles of very fast grass-
land and the pace was very
hot. After a mile, Nick
Barton of I.C. was heading
the field and he went on to
win by over 200 yards. The
I.C. team, weakened by flu
and injury, managed to
finish their first and second
team scorers by 37th posi-
tion and thus made sure of
the League Trophy. It was
good to see Barry Jones
back in action and he is
obviously going to make an
impression on British three-
miling this summer since he
finished twenty-fourth on
Wednesday only a week
after recovering from a heel
injury which has kept him
out of action for five
months.
The second division of
the league was held on
Wimbledon Common and
I.C.'s third team ran very
well to finish eighth out of
twenty-six teams. We would
like to congratulate Norman
Morrison of Maths II on
winning the Scottish Junior
Cross-Country Champion-
ships last weekend.
6-a-side
The R.C.S. 'A' team com-
forably retained the Stephens
trophy for six-a-side football
in lest Wednesday's final at
Harlington. In a repeat of
last year's final, they beat a
weakened Guilds ' A ' side
rather comfortably. Prev-
iously, in the semi-final, the
Guilds team had surprisingly
overcome a strong Mines 'A'
team.
The Losers Cup was won
by the Guilds 'D' side from
Mech. Eng. 2.
