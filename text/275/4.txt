Anti-Specialisation
Dear Sir,
I would like to write in
support of generalisation of
IC courses pointing out some
of the faults of specialisation.
The most obvious is that
the male-female ratio is ridi-
culous compared with soc-
iety (USK would help if offi-
cial machinations do not
alienate surrounding col-
leges); resulting in one of
present-day man's greatest
fears, that of being thought
homosexual, making men
here behave with so-called
'masculine' reactions; e.g.
unnecessary heavy drinking
and swearing, violence and
repression of artistic feelings
leading to childish protective
insticts, cliques and minority
discrimination as shown by
constituent colleges, no NUS
membership, ICWA, the
Union Bar rule.
The second is that with
too many lectures etc. IC has
a school like atmosphere de-
trimental to staff-student re-
lataions making students
feel inferior to staff, a feel-
ing helped by madnesses
like the present exam system,

lack of printed lecture notes
etc. Successful staff-students
committees demand no in-
ferior or superior feelings.
Scientists have to be
trained but IC does unfor-
tunately nothing else but pro-
duce graduates concerned
only with science as prac-
tised in the lab or with man-
agement but not with the
functioning and direction of
society.
Generalisation at IC must
be a good thing.
Yours etc.

Victorian Society say 'Save 180'
Sir,
You may have noticed
that the Victorian Society
have put in an objection to
the College pulling down the
Queen's Gate property and
in particular 180. The case
for conservation is that this
house is a fine example of
the work of Norman Shaw,
one of the most important
of the late 19th C. architects
and is of great importance
in the development of build-
ing style. But apart from that
it is externally very pleasant
to look at and has internally
some glorious decorations by
William Morris; and the
whole group of buildings
give to Queen's Gate an air
of calm and peace quite
alien to the rather dreary
Physics building. Of course
the College's case is also
strong: a new Mathematics
building is required but with
Springtime Hope
Dear Sir,
In your last issue, B.
Hains, in his letter on Staff-
Student relations, seems to
have lost control of his fact-
ual functions when he wrote
that "The question 'what if
both sides reason differently?'
(posed by D. Christopher) is
totally irrelevant and sympto-
matic of the attitudes ex-
pressed by P. Corbyn and
others of 'us the students
against them the staff."
When have I ever ex-
pressed the attitude he refers
to? Mr. Hains' statement is
untrue and symptomatic of
the attitude expressed by
certain people in this college
of "If you can't beat them by
reason tell lies about them."
For another example of this
attitude find out about a let-
ter sent to the RCSU meet-
ing which smeared Les
Ebdon using this same tech-
nique.. If B. Hains had both-
ered to ask me, or any of the
'others' he refers to, about
what our attitude to staff-
student relations is, we could
have told him.
As it says in CEFE 5, "As
socialists we believe in staff-
student co-operation." This
means co-operation in as
many fields as possible so
as staff and students together
will be able, as Les Ebdon
writes in this Felix (ED. See
page 6), to effectively coun-
ter the pressures of Govern-
ment and Industry. B. Hains
would perhaps like to know
of the weekly meetings we
have to which staff are wel-
come—and even come! Fur-
ther, perhaps he could say if
the M&P Soc improved or
undermined staff-student re-
lations in RCS when I was
president of it last year.
Yours, abounding in
spring-time hope,

a little ingenuity and thought
an alternative site could be
found. But what then for 180
Queen's Gate, always sup-
posing the College could not
use it in the same way as No.
170? With the example of
Evelyn Gardens, it is not out-
side the bounds of imagin-
ing to see it being converted
into another student house,
perhaps for errant Physic-
ists.

Sir,
Since the appearance of
my drawings etc., in particu-
lar the RCS Carnival Ticket
and the cartoon in the last
issue of FELIX, I have been
approached by several mem-
bers of the College who pro-
ceeded to express doubts
about my sanity.
To prevent further occur-
ence of these hurtful en-
counters, may I use your
magazine to inform the world
that I am undoubtedly sane,
and shall remain so.

Universities:
Whatis right
not
who is right
Sir,
I enjoyed the articles by
the two Matthews on the
function of the University.
Both advocates change which
is obviously necessary. There
is certainly no lack of analy-
sis and diagnosis of the ills of
IC or society in general.
However, I am convinced of
one thing. If a few more men
and women decided to be
absolutely honest in all their
dealings and tried to find
answers on the basis of what
is right and not who is right,
then things would change a
lot faster, both in the Col-
lege and in the nation.

Direction of Science
Sir,
To see the true nature of
the staff-student committees,
they must be put in their con-
texts. Science is not a static
entity but must be constantly
developing. This requires the
full participation of all those
concerned^. Potential scient-
ists must be put in a position
to survey, analyse and direct
science. This is one possible
role of the committees — to
bring both staff and students
together to criticise and con-
trol their work.
However, the controllers
of industry want persons suf-
ficiently competent to execute
given tasks, but too ignorant
to criticise the purpose of the
tasks. The authoritarian
teaching structure and the
exam system work towards
alienating the student from
any sense of purpose in his
work, apart from the social
self-improvement afforded by
a degree. In this latter con-
text, we see the role of the
committees as they tend to
work towards increasing the
efficiency of the college
machine and as a sop to "stu-
dent participation."
In physics, however, we
see a glimpse of the former
role: a movement to bring
the committee "to examine
the whole purpose of physics
education". One hopes that
this means more than an ex-
amination of the efficiency of
the system. It may be that
those involved have sufficient
vision to attempt to equip
future generations of students
with the knowledge and atti-
tudes that are the means of
control over the direction of
their science. If they dare at-
tempt this transformation of
the very nature of the de-
partment, then, certainly, a
head-on clash with the auth-
orities, which has seemed so
remote from I.C., will be-
come a startling reality.
Yours fraternally,
D. Christopher

Trade Unions in Universities
Clive Jenkins hoped he'd
address us soon as 'brothers
and sisters' rather than
'ladies and gentlemen'. The
Joint General Secretary of
the ASTMS was talking to
an assorted 50 or so mem-
bers of IC a week ago.
His union are most inter-
ested in the white collar
workers as they are 'one of
the most vigorously exploited
groups in the country'. There
was a new attitude among
them now — a few years ago
these people 'didn't think a
union could help'. However,
now the white collar men
are the 'most dynamic sector
of British trade unionism
because the people in it are
the most dissatisfied'.
Clive recalled that their
branch at IC was one of the
oldest. ASTMS is now re-
cruiting academic staff and
are considering a merger
with the Association of Uni-
versity Teachers. 'There is a
need for a much more com-
prehensive trade union or-
ganisation in the universities',
Jenkins continued. Danger
lay in the Prices and Incomes
Board which was 'assuming
the character of employers
without the managerial re-
sponsibilities'. A one-day
strike is planned in April..
One college staff member
disclosed the fear his col-
leagues had of joining a trade
union. They mistrusted the
methods used in negotiations.
Also he wasn't convinced
that a one-day strike would
have much effect. But Clive
had the answers. 'Collective
bargaining', was the key and
academic staff needed experi-
enced experts to put their
case; i.e. the ASTMS. On the
strike, the mass media would
ensure its success.
Answering another ques-
tion about wage increase
'drying up the economy', Jen-
kins was unruffled. 'Britain is
rich—she has a balance of
payments surplus of £300m.
a year. But the surplus is
turned into a deficit because
of the politicians' mistakes'.
As examples he quoted the
F i l l and paying aid to Sin-
gapore, which he regards as
a 'police state'.
He briefly mentioned the
situation in the steel industry
—'there are regrettably some
frictions with other trade
unions'. This was because of
the latter's fight for self-pre-
servation in the face of de-
clining membership.
All through his short
speech and the questions
afterwards Clive Jenkins
radiated affable self-confid-
ence. But not far beneath the
surface one could sense the
tough negotiator and the
shrewdness that has helped
to make ASTMS the fastest
growing union in the coun-
try.
Revolution in the Theatre
If you want some good straightforward theatre, go and
see 'Hide Out' at the Westminster Theatre. Set in a ski-hut
somewhere in Europe, it deals with revolution and counter-
revolution, politics, love, hate and death. The story starts
with a reunion of old Resistance fighters, an odd mixture of
men and women whom only a strong cause could bring
together. As they chat and banter, criticise and discuss, their
erstwhile chief in the resistance dramatically announces an-
other revolution. Guns and people come and go and strong
emotions burst out. The son of one of the fighters, Walther
Krohn (Victor Lucas), is inextricably mixed up in the new
fight. Everything moves fast with many cross-currents, and
as the curtain falls at the end of the acts there is a certain
tenseness.
The characters are all in-
teresting — some more pre-
dictable than others. The one
who eventually has the most
influence never appears on
the stage and has the unlikely
occupation of teaching the
violin. Especially likeable are
David Stewart as the Bishop
and Philip Friend as Max, an
artist. Here is a churchman
who stands for his faith and
finds it practical in every situ-
ation, and another who
breaks out of his artistic
world and dies for his con-
victions. The whole play is
concerned with the central
issue of who will control in
families and nations, and
with the real meaning of
freedom. It is the story of
many people and countries
and is frighteningly topical
in these days.
The set is well designed
and defies connection with
any particular country,
though it is obviously Euro-
pean. It is more than com-
petent in creating the atmos-
phere.
One drawback in the West-
minster is its comfort-—after
a hard day's study the tend-
ency is to doze. However,
the student price of 5/- and
a dramatic, thoughtful play,
captured the interest of this
dour technologist!
