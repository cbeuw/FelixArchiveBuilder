weife darkened when the latest U.O.I.I, (see. front page as$ Felix) w s
parti;/ revived i n the Ccneert H a l l on Tuesday;. ' V/ith w e l l under 300
people "present, the constitutional changes were postponed to yet
another, continuation of the same meeting next term, Irnmediately after
the meeting there w i l l be a second meeting, which w i l l be the required
one; month ffteanr the beginning of the f i r s t meeting, it© discuss the changes
for the last time. Tuesday was i n fact: spent i n deciding whether t h i s
was constitutionally possible. The date of the next meeting was fixed
for May 13th and i t w i l l he held i n l e c h . Eng..
E a r l i e r , while hopefully waiting for a. quorum, the, increased H a l l
rents were discussed. The College has found no apparant loop-holes,
except 'that the Southside. Security Guards need not be paid for by
the H a l l , as the'y patrol the whole building. The r i s e must take effect
now as the U.G-.C. ruling is already 5 years old! Next year there w i l l
be a work study into wages i n H a l l s .

legal reason why the loss *

such large fund-raising ideas w i l l be put before a Union Meeting.
Po stgraduate Grant s
A meeting was held on Tuesday at Kings College to follow
up the action taken so far on the London PG allowance. We had received
an extremely unsatisfactory reply from the D.E.S. and are sending ano-
ther l e t t e r . We are hoping to arrange far better liason -with other ~
groups interested i n grants and London allowances, i n particular with
the London Regional'Organisation of the N.U.S. and with staff groups
acting on the recent cut i n the staff London weighting. We are trying
toorganise some lobbying of MPs and others concerned.
