The Rector in his speech at the Commemoration
Day celebrations in the Albert Hall confined him-
self almost entirely to a factual review of the
progress that has so far been made in the expansion
programme for the college. He began "by quoting a
government estimate that 85,000 more scientist and
engineers would be required during the next 10 years
and went on to show that I.C. is doing its full
share in trying to achieve this increase.
VITAL STATISTICS
During the 3 years 1953 to 1956 the number
of students has increased from 1650 to 2240, an
increase of 36/0. A corresponding increase of 33;i>
has taken place in the number of staff, mainly
by the creation of 5 new chairs in the depart-
ments of Aeronautical Structures, Instrument Tech-
nology, Nuclear Power, Parasitology and Soil Mech-
anics.
INCREASED ACCOMODATION
The Reotor stated that the total floor spaoe
had. been increased by 2Cf~> by the ^sd&itioffi of an
extra floor to Mines and the Goldsmith's extension
budildings, and the erection of the new building
for Aeronautics and Chemical Engineering. This
building 13 rapidly ne-o-ing completion, and the
Aeronautics department is already in occupation.
The Hector reaffirmed the authorities' intention
to increase residential accomodation as soon as
possible, and reminded his audience that the Coll-
ege had recently acquired a site in Princes Gard-
ens, and hopes to have accomodation for another
450 students ready in two years time.
The first quarter of the expansion programme
could now be considered complete, and the staff
and students were thanked for their co-operation
under difficult conditions.
The Rector concluded by outlining the iraaed-
iate expansion programme, and he felt that with
the aid of the government, University, and a l l
others concerned i t should be possible to achieve
a l l the objectives.
C H P R C H S E R V I C E
The Rector, Deans, graduates, v i s i t o r s and
students assembled i n Holy T r i n i t y Church for
worship, before proceeding to the Albert H a l l .
The preacher was the V.Rev.Dr. A.C. Don, Dean
of Westminster.
The g i s t of Dr. Don's sermon was as follows:
-The climate of opinion i s changing so that,
whereas Huxley and other great s c i e n t i s t s of the
19th. Century had to f i g h t for /hat they believed
to be true, the Church has learnt much from
Science and there i s now.an attitude of mutual
respect. However, f a i t h i s no optional extra.
To worship God as Lord only of the Church, and
not also of Creation, and therefore of History,
P o l i t i c s , Science, i s to court i d o l a t r y . The
s c i e n t i s t must also answer the question:"What
think Ye of Christ ?"

THE FUTURE ROLE OF TECHNOLOGY
This years Special V i s i t o r f o r Commemor-
ation Day was S i r John Cockcroft, K..C.B. ,
F.R.S., Director of the Atomic Energy,
Research Establishment, Harwell, who was
introduced by the Chairman of the Governing:
Body, The Rt. Hon. The Viscount Falmouth.
Sir John, in his opening remarks, outlined
the basic research that had been carried out
on nuclear physics a quarter of a century ago
and stated that the rapid development going
on at the present was only possible because
of this work. He prophesied that twenty years
hence the greater part of a l l energy i n this
country would be provided from atomic sources
and considered that I.C. had an important
part to play i n this development^' by the
recent creation of the Chair of Nuclear Power.
Weed K i l l e r Sways U.S. P r e s i d e n t i a l Election.
S i r John pointed out that the advent of the
atomic era heralded more automation but he
stressed that this was merely a continuation
of something that had been going on since the
Industrial Revolution and was not new. He
stated that automation would make a l o t of
u n s k i l l e d workers redundant but that many more
technicians would be required to operate the
new machines. S i r John was emphatic that i t
was possible to t r a i n u n s k i l l e d workers to
become semi-skilled technicians, thus giving
them a greater interest in their work. He
agreed,however,that the development of tech-
nology would produce many new problems,and
instanced the increased crop yields i n the
U.S. due to the use of new weed k i l l e r s , which
had given r i s e to problems that were a major
issue i n the present P r e s i d e n t i a l Elections.
Need for Creative Designers.
S i r John outlined what he considered were
the ingredients for technical success. These
were f i r s t l y a basic new idea or synthesis of
ideas, secondly, adequate f a c i l i t i e s and funds
for the development of that idea, and t h i r d l y
a team of technologists capable of designing
and streamlining the product for maximum
production. At present we were most in need
of technologists and compared with the United
States and Russia we were outnumbered by 10
to 1 and 20 to 1 respectively,
S i r John ended by appealing for a more
broadly based education for technologists
with more time given i n the curriculum for
the humanities. The greatest need in Indust-
ry today was not for men who had specialised
in a p a r t i c u l a r narrow f i e l d of technology
but f o r those who had a broard s c i e n t i f i c
education and were able to adapt themselves
to the continually changing needs of new
development. He thought that Imperial
College had an important part to play i n
providing t h i s form of education and advoc-
ated the provision of r e s i d e n t i a l f a c i l i t i e s
for a l l students as a necessary part of t h e i r
education.
