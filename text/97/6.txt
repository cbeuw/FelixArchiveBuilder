R.C.S. revived their freshers' dinners
after ten years and held three functions i n
the Ayrton H a l l . These were followed by the
usual business i n the bar below. Unfortunately
on these occasions the singing was led not by
t h e i r tousle-haired President but by C. and G.
and Mines insurgents.
The Mines Freshers' Dinner was followed by
speeches of a high standard - some choice phrases
being remembered by those attending. Eavesdrop-
pers watching the yard drinking from Imperial
I n s t i t u t e Road are reported to have been r e v o l t -
ed by the sight of Mr. Wallace drinking from the
Pornographer's Pot before winding up the proc-
eedings with a r e c i t a t i o n of "Eskimo Nell" pack-
ed with action and feeling.
Last week witnessed the four Guilds' Dinners.
These followed the usual pattern. A fresher t r i e d
to steal the limelight from John Le Butt and his
vulgar poetry. His trousers were accordingly r e -
moved. Such Is the treatment for precocity among
freshers.
Miners Steal Spanner
T O O L
THE SPANNER WAS STOLEN ON MONDAY NIGHT by
twelve Miners. After careful plans had been
made i n the "Queen's" and watches had been
synchronised, Mike Rutter and John Nicholls
entered the bar,

which was f u l l of
Guildsmen celebrat-
ing their l a s t
Freshers' Dinner.
Mike and John were
forced to climb on
to the bar (the d i s -
traction they had
hoped f o r ) . Just as
they had done so, at
precisely 10.10 p.m.
as planned, the
spanner, resting as
expected at the back
of the bar, was
whisked away through
the side door by a member of the support group
under the noses of umpteen Engineers. A group
outside transferred i t through the wicket gate
into a waiting car which vanished into the night.
Those Miners remaining after the coup r e t i r -
ed without much trouble to the "Queen's", only
to be attacked by angry Guildsmen i n Queen's
Gate Terrace a f t e r closing time - Rutter l o s t
his trousers i n public.
The Spanner attended the Mines Union Meet-
ing on Tuesday. When the meeting ended at 1.56
i t was suspended from second floor windows i n
the R.S.M. entrance arch. Meanwhile Guilds had
massed i n Room 17, and, Just after 2 p.m.,
came round to the front Of Mines. They got t h e i r
beloved matchwood back after 20 minutes of hard
scrapping. Several trousers changed hands, and
the appearance of a police car brought matters
to a close. We hope to print additional details
and a photograph i n the next issue.
