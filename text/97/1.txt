ALBERT HALL
The Ceremony proper began at 3pm. i n the
Albert H a l l . Last year there were 3000 pres-
ent, this year there seemed to be considerably
more. To the strains of d i g n i f i e d and glorious
chamber music the b r i g h t l y be-robed elders,
preceded by student o f f i c i a l s , made their way
slowly across the arena to their positions
on the dais. The Student Orator, Randy Andy,
read h i s Opening Proclamation i n precise and
strident tones. The choir then gave a pleasant
rendering of Purcell's "Welcome A l l * .
Then began the tedious presentation of
Associates and Dlplomates. Over three hundred
graduates tripped across the platform with
troglodyte tread and bowed i n various comic
ways to the Chairman of the Governors and the
Chairman of the Delegacy. The l a t t e r part of
these proceedings became more s o p o r i f i c due
to a stroke of genius by Miss Imogen Hoist,
Conductress of the Music. The Guildsmen were
presented to the accompaniment of sweet and
melodious music (quite out of character).
A touching ceremony followed when Mr William
S e l k i r k , donor of S e l k i r k H a l l and the Selkirk
Scholarships i n Mines, was presented with an
honorary A.R.S.M. at the grand o l d age of 95.
A precedent was set t h i s year by the i n t -
roduction of rather humorous c i t a t i o n s acc-
ompanying the presentations of the newly elect-
ed Honorary Fellows. This i s a departure which
i s to be encouraged. (We suggest that the S t a f f
Orator should peruse the columns of F e l i x more
c l o s e l y and l a y In a better stock of jokes for
next y«*r.)
The Rector then gave a short report on the
expansion of the College. An account of h i s
speech w i l l be found elsewhere i n this issue.
Never have so many suffered at the hands of
so few as the choir (?) sang (?) aided (?) and
abetted (?) by the organ (?) "The Shepheard's
Wonder*. This was set to music especially
written for the occasion by Christopher Shawj
we wish he had not.
The College was fortunate t h i s year i n
having as i t s special V i s i t o r S i r John Cock-
c r o f t , who gave an interesting discourse on
the future role of technology (reported
elsewhere). The chqlr'then l e d the whole
assembly i n the national Anthem and the Ceremony
came to a close with the recession.
CLARIDGES
This year's Commemoration B a l l was not as
d i g n i f i e d an a f f a i r as one might^expect from
i t s venue and the price of t i c k e t s . Even our
august President, with his charming lady
(rumoured to be an e x - g i r l f r i e n d of Oggi),
Indulged i n some rather h e c t i c j i v i n g . The
B a l l could however be described as a success,
in f a c t , on the whole very good. The crowded
f l o o r , which allowed the intimacy of a rugby
scrum, and the continuous buffet, e x c e l l e n t l y
stocked with highly i n d i g e s t i b l e delicacies,
amply provided for the Freudian lusts of the
President and the rest of his students.
The evening wore on and was f i n a l l y brought
to a close at 2.30a.m.by the singing of 'Auld
Lang Syne* and a rousing Boomalaka by the Guilds
contingent. Everyone seems to have enjoyed
themselves and we can recommend this function
as an expensive luxury which should be i n -
dulged i n at least once.
