SQUASH N E W S
Tha squash season i s now well under way.
The 1st. team have played three matches so
far. In two of these, against Battersea and
the School of Oriental and A f r i c a n Studies we
were successful. The t h i r d match against St.
Catherines College Cambridge played at home
on Saturday 27th October r e s u l t e d i n our f i r s t
defeat. It was extremely hard fought and was
only decided i n St. Catherines favour i n the
f i f t h game of the f i n a l t i e .
George Hodgson, a freshman, has now estab-
lished himself on the f i r s t team and Harry
M i l l s , an insurgent from Capetown University
and Richmond Rugger Club i s at present prov-
iding strength at number f i v e .
We welcome back to the club Ray Scott-White
who two seasons ago was a regular 1st. team
member and i s now gradually regaining his old
form.
HOCKEY
In the f i r s t match of the season, on Wed.
Oct. 17th., I.C. gave a good account of i t -
s e l f by drawing 3-3 with a weakened St. Bart's
Hospital team at Harlington. I.C. may be
considered fortunate i n that they scored their
f i r s t goal against only nine opponents but
nevertheless they earned a draw. I t was an
e n t i r e l y different story when the Old Dunstab-
lians were entertained the following Saturday.
Extremely poor p o s i t i o n a l play gave the CD's,
chance to make additional use of their hard
h i t t i n g and I.C. must be considered lucky to
have l o s t only f i v e g o a l 3 to one.
Coming 1st. team fixtures ares-
Sat. Nov. 3rd. Vickers Armstrong H.
Wed. Nov. 7th. U.L. Cup. 1st. round.

On the 18th. October the f i r s t lunch time
Volley B a l l game took place i n Hyde Park.
Mrs Robinson "volleyed o f f " the f i r s t b a l l
and a team of twelve then proceeded to warm
up. Even the Editor of Phoenix joined i n
and was seen keenly trying his hand at
the game.
Contrary to popular b e l i e f t h i s game i s
not a g i r l ' s game; two good teams make i t
good to watch and good exercise to play. It
Is widely known on the Continent.
A l l are welcome and i f numbers are large
some sort of booking w i l l be introduced. So
i f you want to play, come along to our ground,
between the Albert Memorial and Alexandra Gate
any Tuesday or Thursday at 1.15 pm. Further
developements w i l l be posted on the Pol'sh
Society notice board.
The idea to 'play b a l l ' during the lunch
time breaks (Tuesday and Thursday) was o r i g -
inated by the Polish Society and gained the
support og the Union. A proper portable
equipment has been Durchased and this w i l l
be i n use In a week or two.

RUGGER
The 1st. XV has had somewhat mixed fortunes
to date mainly due to the l*>ck of s p i r i t on the
f i e l d among the forwards ^no undecisive tackling
and f a l l i n g by the whole team. The 2nd., A, B,
and C X V s are as yet undefeated.
In a match which snould have been won more
e a s i l y I.C. defeated U.C.H. by 19 pts. to 8
pts. Perhaps the best display to date was
against Wasps Vandals the following Saturday.
Here the forwards showed that they do possess
some v i t a l i t y and good marking by the I.C.
backs coupled with t i r e l e s s covering by Gilbert
saw the Wasps leading by only a dropped goal
twenty minutes from 'no side'.''"The superior
fitness of the opposition then catie to the fore
however, and they scored 17 more points before
Stone went over f o r a try i n a state of near
collapse just before the f i n a l whistle.
The less said of the match against Reading
University the better, for unenthusiastic
forward forward play, poor marking and tackling
by the backs and a succession of petty i n f r i n g -
ments In our own 25 allowed Reading to amass
an early lead. Only l a t e i n the second h a l f
did I.C show any s p i r i t when they scored
6 points from a good try (Stone) and a penalty
goal (Hearn).
A considerable Improvement was shown l a s t
Saturday when I.C. defeated Rosslyn Park 'A'
by two penalty goals (Stone) and two t r i e s
(Lanz and Shepherd) to two t r i e s and a penalty
goal, after losing Charles In the f l r 3 t ten
Minutes. As so often happens the loss of a
mail brought out the best i n the team and apart
from one or two defensive lapses and an alarm-
ing tendency to give away penalties within a
kickable distance, th9 side seemed quite imp-
ressive. Stone was a tower of strength at
outside-half and Dibley was predominant at
wing-forward.
