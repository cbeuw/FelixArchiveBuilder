ROGER SYKES
The Editor of Phoenix, accomplished artist,
musician and amateur astronomer, is a delightful
character who really enjoys the full life he leads,
Roger Ian Sykes comes from Almondbury (pronounced
"Aimbree") in the West Riding of Yorkshire and is
twenty-one years old. He is now a third year- Aero-
nantical Engineer - but after four years at I.C.
While at King James G.S. in his home town, he
acquired an enthusiasm for art and in particular
scraper-board drawings. Today, R.I. Sykes is one
of the few recognised scraper-board artists in this
country. Ever since he won a competition at the age
of 13, his entry appearing in the local evening paper,
he has had his drawings published regularly in that
paper. How there i s one in every issue. Recently Roger
illustrated an official guide-book to Derbyshire. He
often undertakes commissions for drawings of an archi-
tectural nature, illustrates Christmas Cards, and,
moreover, is a first class cartoonist.
It is not surprising that, when leaving school at
18, Roger considered art as a career. He is, however,
very much1
interested in astronomy, and, in particular,
astronautics. It was A.C. Clarke, Chairman of the
British Interplanetary Society, who advised Roger to
come to I.C. Roger won a scholarship here and so i t
was that art became " a hobby that pays". This "hobby
that pays" was very useful when the first year had to
be repeated - i t provided almost enough money to live
on. The first year savr him as Art Editor of Felix, and
a founder-member of the I.C. Art Club. In his second
year at college Roger joined the Air Squadron.
The aforegoing should be enough to make the brown
baggers sit up and think again, but Phoenix, art,
aeronautical engineering and space-travel are by no
means the limit of our subject's activities. At 14,
Roger was playing a banjo in a local amateur dance
band. Since he has been in London he has played his
electric guitar in ooffee-houses and pubs, for cash.
He plays in the Air Squadron dance band, occasionally
in the I.C. Jazz Band, and often at hostel "sport
parties".
Cautiously, having noticed a vicious sheath-
knife strapped to his leg, we asked Roger i f he had
any particular likes or dislikes. He likes modern
poetry (he is compiling his own book of quotations),
"Home Rule for Yorkshire", wine, song and one woman.
He dislikes the "Yorkshire pudding" served in London,
people who are seated in railway carriages when he has
to stand, and women who wear trousers. When asked what
his ambitions were,Roger said that he hoped to graduate
without further delays, and to take part time art
training after he leaves whilst being employed in
astronauties. Roger does not wish to make his drawing
a full-time occupation unless he can really make i t
Pay. His marital status, he said, was "doubtful" -
but there is a snapshot of a very oteuriiing lady in
his hostel roraJ
jHettvta to the tditot.

Dear S i r ,
I would l i k e to inform you, with reference
to your E d i t o r i a l of October 6th., that SENNET's
accounts balanced l a s t year without f i n a n c i a l
assistance from the University Union or any other
body. I would deny emphatically the implications
of your following remark about d i c t a t i o n .
Perhaps you were misled i n your guesswork
by the grant made by the Presidents' Council to
assist i n the paying off of the loan made In
the summer of 1954 when SENNET was f i r s t s t a r t -
ed. I do not know i f I need to add that I do
not think that SENNET i s original i n having an
i n i t i a l debt nor are we any more subject to
dictation than the man who has an overdraft at
his bank.
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
Elizabeth Harrison,
Editor, rENWST.
(We thank Miss Harrison for her l e t t e r . Over-
come with humiliation, we must admit the fact
that FELIX starts o f f each session with an over-
draft with I.C.Union. We congratulate the s t a f f
of SENNET on the quality of the paper consider-
ing the job they must have to make ends meet.
We wish we could p r o f i l e S i r Laurence O l i v i e r
in every issue. - J.V.B.)

Dear S i r ,
At present there are two Christmas I s -
lands; one i s i n the middle of the t a c i f i c
Ocean, the other i n the Indian Ocean south-
west of Java. It i s proposed to create a
third island i n the middle of I.C. where a l l
shipwrecked mariners from the sens of science
are invited to join a community dedicated to
the pursuit of l i t e r a t u r e and philosophy and
convened to p r e s e r v e l i f e from the strangle-
holds of authority, r e s t r i c t i o n and i n t o l e r -
ance. May I implore prospective Islander? to
digest the notice appearing on the Union's
internal board by the bar and to append their
signatures before this venture s i n k s .
Sincerely y o u r s ,
Peter Jarman.
