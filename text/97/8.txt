R O W I N G
During the f i r s t weeks of this term a l l
the sports clubs of the College have been
busy. Among the busiest has been the Boat
Club whose o f f i c i a l s have had the job o f
sorting out about eighty fresher members
some of whom have had rowing experience
and some (70/t) who have not. Between now
and the Thames Head of River the novices
must be taught enough about the art of rowing
so that they may be entered i n this event and
enjoy the race.
As f a r as the older members are concerned,
there have been formed four t r i a l eights which
are now i n t r a i n i n g and doing well. There
w i l l be much competition for the f i r s t eight
seat during the next few weeks thus adding a
good Incentive to individual t r a i n i n g and
keeness. This promises to be a good year
and a l l members are looking forward to comp-
e t i t i o n with confidence and interest. Out of
the present fourteen eights on the water we
should be able to produce some fast crews.

two University fixtures.
The f i r s t was the Poly Mob Match at Hempstead

technic Harriers (607 pts. to 1329 pts.). F i r s t
man home was John Evans i n 27m 54s f o r the

MOUNTAINEERING CLUB
The Freshers Meet
Twenty campers and ten others arrived i n
North Wales at 2.00am. on Saturday 20th. Oct.
The r a i n came i n horizontal sheets and the
six who were staying i n the hut quickly
disappeared in the gloom leaving the others
to t h e i r fate. The campers quickly revised
their idea of camping at 2000ft. near Llyn
Bochlwyd and pitched the camp about 200yds.
from the road. Apart from the gale, the rain
and the new lake which formed round the tents,
everything went well. One pair did however
manage to pitch their tent inside out, a
remarkable feat i n the conditions.
The gale continued and whilst the hut men
slept i n front of a roaring f i r e most of the
twenty were s i t t i n g i n squelching sleeping
bags holding on to their shuddering tent poles.
Mid-day Saturday saw most of the campers
b i l l e t e d in farm houses, barns»and huts through-
out the valley. That was the end of the rain.
For the rest of the weekend a high standard
of climbing was maintained on six d i f f e r e n t
c l i f f s . No accidents are reported although
one unfortunate leader found himself hanging
upsidedown from a belay and another was saved
from scattering the gaping crowd below by a
h o l l y bush.
The freshers did extremely well, many doing
their f i r s t rock climb i n tne pouring rain.
It does not r a i n perpetually in Wales and i t
is hoped that there w i l l be enough support
to run another coach at the end of January.
SAILING CLUB
The annual knockout competition for the
Castaway's Cup was held at Welsh Harp on the

The f i r s t race of the f i n a l was won by 'J.O.
by the narrow margin of 20y pts. to 19 pts.
The second race was very keenly contested and
interesting for the tactics used. After one
round I.C. was i n a strong p o s i t i o n with 1st.
2nd. and 5th. but one boat h i t a buoy In the
second round whilst duelling with two U.C.
