Writing an e d i t o r i a l i s a very d i f f i c u l t job.
We were going to write about the standard of
manners i n I.C. - we actually saw the Chairman
of the S.C.C. (of a l l people) comb his hair when
standing i n the middle of Claridges' Ballroom J
We were intending to praise Dr. Sparkes despite
his unkind remarks about "distortions which
appear i n FELIX" at the Union Meeting. We were
to point out that the s t a f f orations on Commem.
Day might have been as audible as Andy Levine's
had they taken the trouble to rehearse as he
did. The production manager t e l l s us that we
have no room f o r a l l this i n this issue.

The Extraordinary Union Meeting was a c t u a l l y
held In the Concert H a l l , much to most peoples
surprise. The H a l l had a completed f l o o r i n g
which was t a s t e f u l l y covered with green canvas.
The two main items were a d i s s e r t a t i o n from
the Planning O f f i c e r , Dr. Sparkes, and the
presentation of the House Committee's Report.
The l a t t e r item i s reported below.
Dr Sparkes was introduced by K i t c h who said
that we should now hear 'straight from the
horse's mouth' of the progress of the building.
Dr Sparkes said that Mr Kitchener was a rude
man and he had never been c a l l e d a horse before
In front of so many swine. Dr Sparkes made
no promises and he defended the contractors.
In 17% of the contract time 45# of the work
had been done. Good labourers were as scarce
as good students and when one sub trade defaulted
this had a snowball effect on stopping the
work of others. Penalty clauses In building
contracts could not be imposed these days.
Dr Sparkes praised Mr Biggs and said that
the work he has done on our behalf was f i v e
times that of Mr Mooney (which was praised
i n the l a s t issue). He t o l d of similar b u i l d -
ing troubles i n Paris and hoped that this
would be some consolation to us. When K i t c h
c a l l e d f o r questions f o r Dr Sparkes to answer,
a voice at the back said "What i s the name
of the play?" (Let us not be unkind to Dr
Sparkes, he i s doing h i s best with a thankless
task.)
The House Committee report, reproduced in
slightly abridged form, was presented as a basis
for discussion and adopted "in toto" after very
l i t t l e debate by the Union. However, provision has
been made for amendments to be made at future
Union meetings.
The Governing Body have provided, free of
rent, certain rooms for the use of the Union. The
responsibility of the care and running of the new
Building, whioh will cost about £250,000, rests
primarily on the students of the college; a l l
members of the Union are requested to co-operate by
treating the Building, funiture and fittings with
proper care and respect.

On Tues. l6th Oct., Dr. V.E. Fuchs gave a
most interesting and informative talk entitled
"Trans-Antarctic Reconnaissance". Before a large
enthusiastic audience, he told the story of his
recent visit to the Weddel Sea to set up a base
camp, to receive the main body of the expedition
later this year.
He was introduced by Prof. H.H. Read, who put
forward the suggestion that the "Theron" was trapped
in the ice by design rather than by accident, in
order to attract public attention. Dr. Fuchs said
that as a result of the publicity thus received,
their funds had been considerably swelled.
He took up the story from their arrival at South
Georgia and told of their adventures in the ice be-
fore they reached a suitable place to build the base.
He gave an account of the unloading of the stores and
of the misfortunes which overtook them, until they
were finally ready to leave. He said he was very
anxious to get back to the 8 members of the base party
who have passed a very uncomfortable winter under an
upturned packing-case.
His talk was fully illustrated with colour slides,
whioh were of a high standard and were extremely in-
teresting.
A vote of thanks was proposed by Jon Stephenson,
a past-graduate geologist here, who w i l l be accompany-
ing Dr. Fuchs on the expedition.

The opening and closing hours, and general
administration of the new building will be as a l -
ready outlined in the Blue Book.
