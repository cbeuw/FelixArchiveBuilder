KARAKORAM
EXPEDITION
A Reply
In the first week of June, M r . H . D . D . Watson submitted an
application to the Exploration Board for a proposed expedition to
the Karakoram in June 1963. A special meeting of the Board was
called to consider this proposal and held on the 21st June, 1962.
After allowing for general expenses and for the average annual
cost of insurance of expeditions (£200—see Note 1), the Hon. Trea-
surer concluded that the Board would have about £1,650 available
for distribution in 1962/63, if the Reserve Fund of £600 was drawn
upon.
The proposed expedition would
be composed of 7 members from
the College, an external leader
and doctor (both with previous
Himalayan experience) and a
Pakistani liaison officer, making
a total of 10. M r . Trevor Jones
was to lead the expedition—and
Dr. J. Swallow to accompany it.
It was hinted that M r . Chris.
Bonnington had also been ap-
proached.
The expedition was to carry
out two independent pro-
grammes, one climbing, the other
surveying, in the area of the
Hushe Valley, 60 miles east of
Skardu. In addition, it was in-
tended to carry out limited geo-
logical and meterological work.
Nine members of the College
wished to be included in the
party, although it was uncertain
at that time whether all of them
would still be at College in June
1963.
The estimated cost of the ex-
pedition was approx. £4,600 of
which £2,800 represented air
fares and freight charges. (Be-
cause of the time factor, the ex-
pedition was to fly throughout
from London to Skardu.) Per-
sonal contributions would be £50
per head for students and £150
per head for M r . Jones and Dr.
Swallow.

The Exploration Board was
asked to give its approval to the
expedition—and to support it
with a grant of £1,200. The ex-
pedition hoped to obtain finance
as follows :—;
I.C. Exploration Board £1,200
Mount Everest Foundation
£1,400
Personal Contributions £750
Outside support (and sale
of postcards) £1,250
Total ... £4,600
The proposal was considered at
very great length. The Board
was satisfied with the organisa-
tion of the expedition thus far,
and agreeable, in principle, to the
proposed leadership. Although
the ability of the party to carry
but some of the scientific work
effectively was questioned and
the composition and experience
of the party was discussed, the
Board's main concern, at that
stage, was the financial situation.
A n d this was clearly intimated
to the organisers by letter on
June 22nd. " . . . it (the Board)
regretted that it was unable to
devote so large a part of its re-
sources (to the exclusion of
alrnost any other activity in 1963)
to an. expedition, which would
benefit only a few people, and,
relative to the expense, produce a
small scientific return."
For it was evident that if the
requested support was granted,
not only would the whole of the
present Reserve Fund be ab-
sorbed but also there would be
scarcely any money available
later in the year to finance any
other expeditions which might
be proposed. The Board con-
sidered that other members of the
College should be given the
chance to gain expedition experi-
ence. Moreover the party was
not wholly ' representative' of
the College ; for besides only 70
per cent participation by students
(most of whom would be leaving
College) the expedition was never
publicised outside the Moun-
taineering Club circles. The
Board therefore concluded that
bestowing £1,200 to one expedi-
tion was neither the best, nor
fairest, way of spending that
sum.
Unlike other " grant-award-
ing " bodies, the College, when it
gives its name to an expe-
dition, virtually sponsors it
and therefore assumes full re-
sponsibility for it. In the
case of an expensive expedition
operating in a difficult and dis-
tant country, this responsibility
and risk can be considerable,
often involving diplomatic diffi-
culties, and the Board must con-
sider not only its own available
funds, but also the likelihood of
the expedition being completely
solvent and trouble-free at the
time of its departure. In the
case of the Karakoram expedi-
tion, it was generally considered
that if the expedition was to be
supported by the Board at all,
then the Board ought to take a
large measure of financial re-
sponsibility (—and this it was
unable to do). It was also felt
that in addition it would be
necessary to keep about £500 in
reserve to balance any unforseen
expenditure over the estimated
limit. This would leave the
Board with no money for any
other purposes.
With the full support of the
Exploration Board a n d , the
Mount Everest Foundation, the
expedition still needed to gather
£1,250 from outside sources.
Had the Board granted a lesser
amount, this would have severely
reduced the chances of the ex-
pedition being fully supported by
other organisations. Because of
the responsibility involved, the
Board was therefore forced not
to support the expedition in any
way, for with formal approval
alone, the expedition's chances of
gaining full financial support
were almost negligible.
The Board's decision therefore
called for a change of plans on
the expedition's behalf or more
concrete evidence that sufficient
money would be forthcoming
from outside.
Notes
1. The Board automatically ac-
cepts responsibility for ade-
quately insuring all personnel
and equipment on any expedi-
tion that it approves and on
average this costs the Board
£200 per year. Insurance of
personnel alone on the Kara-
koram expedition would have
cost the Board approx. £100.
2. The " constant stream" of
Arctic expeditions (12 out of
a total of 32—many of them
training expeditions) is hardly
surprising considering Gt.
Britain's geographical posi-
tion in the world, in that the
Arctic regions are relatively
close and for this reason, a
target for small cheap expe-
ditions. The twelve Arctic
expeditions have cost the
Board £1,320 in all (on aver-
age £110 per expedition) and
over 60 students have bene-
fited therefrom.

Mines Union Meeting
The meeting was opened by the
President with a request that
members desist from the puerility
and garbage projection which has
attended the Union meetings of
the other Colleges. This was
followed by a plea for tw<P
minutes silence, 'for those who
did not return.'
After elections of year reps, a
ferment of discussion took place
on the subject of our mascot,
Mitch. It was reported from the
chair that marauders from Guilds
had forced an entry into the
mascot's boudoir, and removed a
rotund article painted in black,
white and yellow. The explana-
tion was that Mitch, being a
man, had in true Miners' tradi-
tion, suffered the pangs and
arrows of outrageous good for-
tune and had, in the nature of
things, been affected by Spring.
It was further stated that having
sloped off one day, he had re-
turned with a bride, Michelle.
Being a man of true merits, he
had begat a wee one, weight at
birth 1 lb. 3 oz., and while
Michelle was recovering from
her confinement in the West
Indies, her hubby was present at
the meeting. The appearance of
Mitcheson was greeted with ac-
claim^?)
The next subject under discus-
sion was M r . Billingham, one
time bearer of Michelle, and his
colleague, M r . Voss. In an elo-
quent speech, M r . R o y Gardner
suggested that these gentlemen
should be sold to a germ warfare
organisation as guinea pigs, after
suitable treatment in the Round
Pond. The final ruling from the
chair was that M r . Billingham
should be condemned to be M r .
I C W A , with M r . Voss as his pro-
poser.
M r . Mansen, from the floor,
thought it a good idea for the
gentlemen Of Mines to take their
own beer with them on the occa-
sion of the next Swimming Gala
to alleviate the expense incut red
last time. M r . Mansen's splen-
did Gallic singing voice was much
admired by the President, and
with this as a lead, the meeting
was brought to a close with a re-
sounding version of C A T S .
Service Overseas
About half-way through next
term there will be an Imperial
College Overseas Service Week.
The object of this 'campaign' will
be to rouse interest in voluntary
service in the developing countries
and to provide information about
schemes through which volun-
teers can go abroad.
Anyone interested in helping
with this Week should come to
Committee R o o m A at 1.15 p.m.
on Friday, 2nd November, or
contact Roy Ellis through the
Union rack. Members of staff
and postgraduates will be espec-
ially welcome.
