FELIX
Cross Country
Having lost three of the six
runners who ran so well last year
to win the Hyde Park Road
Relay and two other first team
runners beside, the club was on
the look-out for promising
freshers and inspired improve-
ments from returning members to
attempt to maintain the high
standard of the last few years. A
good turnout for the freshers
run, despite transport difficulties,
showed that at least keenness
was present. It remains to be
proved whether the ability neces-
sary to back it up will be re-
vealed.
The first U . L . trial afforded us
our first test, and only Ted
Wilkins, 3rd, Pete Ray, 5th, and
Chris James, 11th, showed good
form although Pete Crews per-
formed creditably in gaining 17th
position.
The following Saturday, our
first team gained 6th place in the
U.C. Invitation Relay, losing to
three University teams, U . C . and
Borough Road T.C. Ted Wilkins
was again in tremendous form,
returning the second fastest time
of the day and beating the Col-
lege best performance for the 1.8
mile course at 8 mins. 13 sees.
Dave Colvin was seventh fasteth
at 8 mins. 28 sees.
On Wednesday, 17th Oct., a
weakened team lost to King's
College at Mitcham over 6.1
miles, but gained some compen-
sation by winning the second
team match. Fresher Howard
Dickson was the first I C man
home with Pete Crews maintain-
ing his improvement in 5th place.
Saturday, 20th October, saw
the annual U . L . v. Polytechnic
Harriers " M o b " match. How-
ever, Poly's mob looked quite in-
significant in comparison with
about 150 University runners.
This race incorporated the final
U . L . trial and both divisions of
the University League. Ted
Wilkins again finished first for
I C in 7th position with Peter Roy
well up at 14th.

Overseas
Vacation
Service
by J.R. Hamilton
The purpose of this, the first of a series of articles, is to outline
the events giving rise to the facilities now available for second year
students to work and gain technical experience during overseas vaca-
tions ; also to describe briefly these facilities offered by the Inter-
national Association for the Exchange of Students for Technical
Experience. In forthcoming issues, Felix intends covering reports
on overseas work and travel by a cross section of men and women
from Imperial College.
In 1934 M r . J . Newby of the Registrar's Staff was approached
by the Engineering Society with a view to obtaining work for students
in industry within the United Kingdom during the summer vacations.
Tit 2 demand for home postings was met and the Imperial College
plans became more ambitious. In 1936 three students from Brussels
were received in this country and in 1937 a small number of Imperial
College students went to Belgium for experience.
This exchange scheme was be- taking up the post is paid a sub-
ginning to spread but War cur-
tailed these early moves. In 1945
the Imperial College Vacation
Training Committee recom-
menced sending students abroad
and arrangements were made for
students to visit this country from
seven countries (Belgium, Den-
mark, France, Holland, Norway,
Sweden, Switzerland).
In 1948 a conference of organ-
isers of student exchanges in ten
countries was convened at Im-
perial College and from this con-
ference emerged the International
Association for the Exchange of
Students for Technical Experi-
ence.
In that year 198 students were
sent abroad under I.A.E.S.T.E,,
168 of whom were from Imperial
College, the remainder from
the other affiliated colleges and
universities has since increased
but Imperial College still ac-
counts for the largest individual
number.
That 168 to 170 eligible men
and women from Imperial are
found satisfactory places for an
average of eight weeks during
summer vacations does not imply
that all applicants are accepted.
As a general rule the student
needs to have completed the pen-
ultimate year of his under-
graduate course and is required
to have had U . K . industrial ex-
perience during the first year,
though this rule is not inflexible.
The student, on accepting a
job, is required to pay a fee of
30/- as a registration fee, each
University and College pays an
affiliation fee according to the
number of students sent abroad.
In most cases the cost of travel
is met by the student who, upon
sistence allowance by the em-
ployer. A few travel grants are
to be had, notably those made
available by I.C.I, and the Cana-
dian National Research Council
for selected students, both of
whom pay travelling expenses
plus a maintenance grant.
I.C.I, require that an applicant
shall work satisfactorily at one
or other of the Company's
British plants for a specified
period during first year vacations
before acceptance for Germany or
Switzerland in the second year.
The National Research Coun-
cil of Canada has in the past
made up to six places available
each year for students studying
at British universities and col-
leges.
The normal subsistence allow-
ance varies considerably from
country to country and this work
should not be regarded as fully
paid employment. A number of
students cover their costs en-
tirely, but those who do not may
find themselves a little out of
pocket, though to offset this ap-
parent financial loss they have
gained a broadening of experi-
ence both technical and social
beyond the reach of men and
women remaining at home.
Indeed, I.A.E.S.T.E. empha-
sizes that one of the main aims
of the Association is to give
students from member nations
an opportunity to view another's
country from the inside as it were,
though Felix hesitates to suggest
that for women students this
should necessarily be a Birds'
Eye View . . .
A t present the Association is
represented by 21 Full Members
and 8 Associate Members frnm
7 -
both North and South America,
Europe, the Near and Middle
East, Asia and Africa, representa-
tion coming from countries as far
apart as Poland, the United
States, India and Argentina.
Unfortunately, some countries
are less able than others to make
use of the available facilities;
South Africa for instance settling
down to winter studies when
those from the Northern Hemis-
phere are seeking summer em-
ployment.
It may be fairly widely known
that some colleges such as the
R . S . M . have for many years un-
dertaken overseas vacational
training and these articles will
not cover their activities. We are
solely concentrating on those
men and women who have
availed themselves of I.A.E.-
S.T.E., and with the co-operation
of these students will publish
facts about the countries they
visited, their work, those they
worked with and their own ex-
periences—good or otherwise.
I.A.E.S.T.E. is now a separate
organisation, independent of the
Imperial College, and having its
own Memoradndum and Articles
of Association.
We wish to thank M r . A . G . E .
Meacock, Superintendent of V a -
cation Studies. Without his kind
assistance these and later columns
would not appear.
