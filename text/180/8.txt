8 F E L I X
Met. Police
- Defeated —
The Rifle Club got off to a
flying start to the season by beat-
ing the Metropolitan Police on
their home ground at Imber
Court for the first time ever.
Normally for this match the
College V I I I is supplemented by
four or more Purples because the
Police always have a very strong
team. This time, however, only
one —. Brian Fitzgerald — could
turn up.
The course was quite a stiff
one. Two cards at 50 yards
were followed immediately by
two at 100. The inexperience of
the I C team compared with the
Police is clearly shown by the
hundred yard scores.

Ffagins X V this week made
their way into the depths of the
Surrey countryside to play
rugger(?) against Camberley A
X V .
On arrival at the ground, they
found to their dismay one 1st
X V and half an A X V . Being
sporting chaps, they took on the
half of the A X V plus half the
1st X V , and after a fantastic first
half were firmly in the lead,
when, as they lay puffing and
gasping, waiting for the second
half, the rest of the opposition's
A team turned up.
To cries of ' 'What the — hell
is going on, ref ?' the new men
joined the ranks of the opposi-
tion, and the 1st team men re-
tired. In the true spirit of Eng-
lish sportsmen, ff's took the fresh
side in their stride to win 11
points to 6.
P.S.—Can we have our player
back, mister.

R C S Morphy Crew back from
Remember, remember, the 7th
is Morphy Day.
While the lesser mortals of the
Rugby Club lie dormant, the
idiots of the Boat Club continue
to set the rest of the College a
good example by setting their
alarms for 7 o'clock and actually
getting up then (in most cases).
Most of the crews are near their
final composition, and compari-
sons can now be made with a
little more confidence.
The Mines Morphy crew shows
greater talent than of recent years,
and in a full course trial last
an outing,
week, they produced the very
creditable time of 8.12 in un-
favourable conditions. It has
been necessary to include several
novices in the Lowry crew, which
has shown considerable fighting
spirit on recent c utings.
Despite the disadvantage of
having no coach, the R C S
Morphy crew is progressing well,
at times showing its true poten-
tial. The Lowry crew has re-
cently been strengthened by a
bearded stranger, and may be
able to surprise the critics on the
day.
The Guilds crews are concen-
trating on fitness rather than
technique, as usual, and are being
ably coached by Jan Smaalders
and Keith Cugan, both experi-
enced I C coaches. Their Lowry
h»s considerable potential, but
has as yet been unable to produce
performances to show this.
A s usual, all crews are taking
the race very seriously, and as
yet, no member has been spotted
in the bar more than eight even-
ings in one week, the reserve
capacity being reserved for the
Boat Club Dinner on Morphy
night.
THE MOLE
Perhaps ifs the beauty, perhaps it's the danger, ptrhaj it's . . .
well, what reason makes an apparently sane person don an old and
stinking boiler suit and tattered pieces of leather apologies for boots,
to crawl down small holes in the ground, only to emerge a short
distance away, after considerable time and effort, looking for a l l
the world like a mud pie. Hard to believe, you say ? Yes, but it does
happen.
These intangible beings are called 'pot-holers,' and are distin-
guished in their natural location by their smell and single 1,000 candle
power eye. Found in society, they can be distinguished by the mad,
lost, longing look in their eyes, the shattered nails, and the ever
present earthy smell.
To try and discover what drives
this mole, let's venture On a short
excursion. We leave on a glor-
iously sunny day, 90 degrees in
the shade, dwarfed by huge rut-
sacks full of so-called necessary
gear, and set off up a mountain
at a great pace. The lead mole
turns round with a look of sadis-
tic gloating and calls out' Hurry,'
as we stumble upwards.
Someday, someone will finally
propound the sad formula-weight
of carried load increases as the
distance squared. Eventually we
arrive and drop exhausted to the
floor, only to hear the Mole tell
us to hurry and get changed.
Perhaps it is the suppressed ex-
citement, or else the curiosity,
but we do as he says, and don
the cold, wet and clammy boiler
suits. ' Where is the cave?' some-
body asks. ' There,' the Mole re-
plies, pointing to an oversized
rabbit hole. With a nit in our
stomachs, we listen to last minute
instructions. ' Oh,' says the Mole
as an afterthought, ' i f anybody
starts to scream from claustro-
phobia, he will have to be kicked
unconscious to avoid upsetting
the rest of the party. Y o u come
second,' he finishes, pointing to
our 40-40-40 camera man.
The Mole then lies down on
his stomach, and disappears
with a wriggle. A few seuonds
later his muffled voice yells
'Come on,' and 40-40-40 kneels
down gingerly and sticks his head
in, then struggles in. Now if you
have not seen a 40-40-40 wriggle
along a passage only 9 inches
wide, then it's potholing you
should go. We struggle, wriggle,
curse, down this incredibly tight
passage. ' What is that smell ?'
asks 40-40-40 ; ' sorry,' replies the
Mole. A little further on, the
Mole says, ' It gets a bit damp
here,' and we hear a loud splash
from 40-40-40. 'Never mind,'
says the Mole, ' you have to dive
later on.'
Eventually after much persua-
sion, we pop into a roomy
cavern. ' Look,' says the Mole,
and we lift our tired heads. The
sight that meets our eyes is
enough to dispel any doubts we
may have had about the whole ven-
ture. We are in a cavern whose
walls are lined with water droplets
which reflect and refract the light
given out by our lamps in such
a way that the surface appears to
be covered with diamonds.
Pearly white stalactites, 30 feet
long, line one wall, a cascade 40
ft. high dominates the other wall,
40 feet of tumbling orange and
white calcite. The roof is lined
with a silvery film of water. This
is our reward.
With great reluctance we
finally turn to go, but such is the
splendour of what we have just
left, that the narrow passage now
seems much shorter and easier.
When we emerge from the ground
it is dark, and we wash ourselves
in the still warm water of the
stream.
It is with no small doubts of
our sanity that we finally wend
our way down to that cool re-
freshing pint, but such is our re-
ward, our feeling of achievement,
that we wish time would stand
still and that we would never
have to face the harsh realities
of fh
<* morrow.
