FELIX
City and Guilds College is for'
tunate in having a fine specimen
of a unique veteran car, a 1902
James and Browne, a marque of
which there is only one other
known example, a later four
cylinder model. Since the car
was built before 1905, it is old
enough to qualify for the London
to Brighton Car run, and has
taken part in this event ever since
being acquired by the College.
Bo has a two cylinder engine,
with a bore of 4£in. and stroke
of 6in., giving a displacement of
2\ litres, and is rated to give
9 h.p. at 600 rpm. The layout is
rather unusual, the two cylinders
being parallel and horizontal
along the axis of the car, with the
crankshafts and the shafts in the
gearbox lying across the car.
There are four forward speeds
and a reverse, the drive being by
chain to tne rear wheels, giving
the car a top speed of 35 mph on
the flat.
On Freshers day, Bo had the
misfortune to shear a key in the
crankshaft, holding the crank
web to the main shaft. This
necessitated the removal of the
engine and gearbox, and a com-
plete stripping of the engine to
repair the damaged parts. A l l
this has been done and the car
5 _
assembled again, so that B o is
almost ready for the road again.
This year, on Sunday, Novem-
ber 4th, Bo will once again be
taking part in the Brighton Run,
starting from the road along the
Serpentine in Hyde Park, at 8.0
a.m. The car and crew hope to
be in Brighton in time for the
Motor Club dinner at 1.30 p.m.
Since Bo was acquired by the
College, he has failed to qualify
only twice—once due to mech-
anical failure, and the second
time, for exceeding the maximum
allowed average speed limit of
20 mph and arriving in Brighton
too early!
AN
OPEN
INVITATION
The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in Y O U — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
