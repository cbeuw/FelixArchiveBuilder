favour of the more glamorous na-
tional campaigns. The optimistic
targets of £2,000 to be raised this
year might be met if more co-
operation could be obtained from
local residents and police, and a
Carnival for a local charity might
encourage this. However, we
wonder if the effort involved in
collecting this sum is really
worthwhile. I C in previous
years has collected about as much
as the rest of U L put together,
but this still seems a paltry sum
when compared with the funds
raised by provincial Universities.
Sheffield, for example, with about
the same numbers as IC,
managed to collect £12,000. Is
this, then, another example of
half-hearted couldn't-care-less-
attitudes which lead to a weak
and unco-ordinated effort in most
of our ventures ?
Imperial College Union is your
Union, and what you contribute
to it is a measure of what you
will get from it. It is up to you
to run your Union and the main-
stay of this is the Union Meeting.
The agenda is there for all to see
on the Union notice board, and it
is hoped that some of you are
intelligent enough to form your
own views and to express your
own opinions at the meeting.
Unless I C changes radically
and for the better, we feel that
our Union will not be worth the
4d. you should have paid for this

A lot of criticism has recently
been directed against the Presi-
dent. " Why is he not in the bar
to-night ?' ' Why does he never
seem to be around the Union ?*
The trouble is that the majority
of people have no idea of what
his job involves. His diary is
crammed full of committee meet-
ings, concerned with the running
of the Union, and with Social
functions where it is his duty to
represent the College. The busi-
ness side of his duties demands a
great deal of preparation if he is
to put the Union's view point to
the best of its advantage, and
his social commitments, although
often of a very pleasant nature,
do take up a lot of his time. O n
top of this, he has to put in some
work for his degree, and set aside
a fair amount of time to spend
with his beautiful new bride.
Perhaps there is a case for giving
the President a year free from
academic studies and for provid-
ing accommodation for married
students in College. Either way,
Asit Chandmal is doing the job
of President to the best of his
ability, and I am sure that he will
turn out to be one of the best
Presidents this College has had,
so give him a chance and don't
expect the impossible.
The Freshers Dinners have so
far passed with little of the usual
inter-college brawls. Indeed, the
spirit of Imperial College seemed
to dominate over the inter-col-
legiate rivalry at many of the
dinners. Some incidents did
occur, however, and much need-
less damage was done, both to
individuals' clothing and to the
Union buildings. Doubtless, this
damage will be paid for by the
Unions responsible—they seem to
have plenty of money to spend in
this direction. It's a pity they
can't grant the Rugby Club some
money to help settle the debt in-
curred after a similar bout of
after dinner high spirits last ses-
sion—after all, the money all
comes from the same source.
The shortage of glasses in the
bar, particularly pint glasses, has
repeatedly been felt during the
large gatherings in the bar after
Freahers Dinners. There can be
_ 3 -
no excuse for not having enough
glasses, especially in view of the
profit of £600 made in the bar
last year. In any case, the Bar
sales would be even higher if
there were enough glasses for all
the thirsty souls who clamour for
liquid refreshment after-making
lusty contributions to the Bawdy
Bar Ballads, invariably rendered
out of tune.
Relations with U L U do not
seem to be improving. They
have cancelled the Swimming
Club's booking for the Gala.
The booking was made in June
after considerable discussion be-
tween the last year's executive
and U L U about this year's Gala.
W h y don't we just secede from
U L U and let them go their own
sweet way.
