- 6 FELIX
RARE BIRDS
' I am a rare b i r d : an oriental who is also a materialist.' The
speaker; none other than our President, Asit Chandmal. The occa-
sion ; upon seconding the motion that I.C. affiliate to the National
Union of Students some two years ago. ' I have saved £50 by belong-
ing to N.U.S. . . . ' the oratory poured o n ; cheap charter flights to
Paris (!!), reduced entrance to the Louvre, cheap books, cheap theatre
tickets, etc., etc. So that's the secret to success ? Clearly, all rare
birds would do well to feather their nests now with N.U.S. conces-
sions . . . who knows who will be President in two years' time ?
What with Mrs. Robinson, support the traditional I.C. policy
keeping rare birds in the Union
Office and blokes demolishing the
old Guilds' building, things are
scarcely what they used to be.
Where is the good old-fashioned
Union Council which could be
relied upon to G O V E R N the
Union and not stand truck from
' slimey, greasy footnicks, fascists
and fellow travellers' as they
called their opponents. Those
old Councils were good politi-
cians and knew the Union wasn't
interested in politics, religion and
things like that—or so they said.
If you want to be a good politi-
cian, never admit i t ; and they
didn't. That N.U.S. is crammed
with politicians is an insinuation
used to smear that organisation
so repeatedly in this college, and
it always rather amuses me as it
invariably comes from politi-
cians.
I just do not believe that
students in this college are not
interested in grants, hostel ac-
commodation, standards of lec-
turing and examinations, which is
politics if you believe the non-
sense and propaganda that is
usually shouted at N.U.S. Any-
one who is concerned with poli-
cies is a politician, and those who

of not belonging to N.U.S. are as
much politicians as M r . Macmil-
lan or a shop steward at Ford's.
It was certainly true that
N.U.S- was under communist
domination when I.C. left it over
its attitude to the war. A lot of
other colleges left at the same
time, but times change—the com-
munists have gone and the other
colleges have rejoined. N.U.S.
has learned its lesson and the
only politics it is concerned with
now are those issues which di-
rectly concern students. But I.C.
remains aloof as the only college
in the country which is not pre-
pared to play its part in voicing
student opinion on the national
But still the babble of half-
truthful, half-witted and inconsis-
tent arguments is heard—'we
cannot afford i t ' we hear them
cry. Who cannot afford it ? The
Rugby Club which gets £300 a
year from the Union—two bob
per Union member? The boat
club, £600 p.a. or four bob a
nob ? O r perhaps the Gliding
Club—£1,200 for a new glider ?
What nonsense ! I do not say
that these clubs should not get
their lolly and good luck to them,
but do not let it be said that we
cannot afford 1/3 per member to
affiliate to N.U.S., which is a
trifling sum to pay towards what
I regard as an excellent institu-
tion.

What is more to the point is
whether we can afford not to join.
Is it unreasonable to ask 1/3 a
nob out of Union funds to allow
I.C. Debating Society to enter for
the ' Observer' Mace, the I.C.
Drama Society to enter the ' Sun-
day Times' Drama Festival, to
gain entry to the charter flight
scheme, the vacation work ser-
vice or the international camps ?
I.C. sports have been abroad on
tours sponsored by the National
Unions of other countries.
If doctors can join the B.M-A.,
teachers the N.U.T. and lecturers
the A.U.T., then surely to good-
ness students can find something
to say and do about student
affairs on the national level. Are
we in I.C. too bloody-minded or
too stingy or too much like nat-
tering grandmothers to get over
the barrage of pettyfogging tripe
to lend a hand in running our
own National Union ?

Since Guilds is in the midst of
the turmoil of reconstruction, this
column is being started to help
people keep in touch with what
is going on in the Union.
First event is this Sunday, the
4th, the day of the Veteran Car
Club run from London to Brigh-
ton. The start is from Hyde
Park, around 8 am, and our
mascot, Bo (" He,' please note,
M r . President) is taking part
again.
On Wednesday 7th, during the
continuation of the recently ad-
journed Union meeting, Morphy
Day will happen. This year, to
avoid fishing odd bods and
trophies out of the Thames, and
also to achieve a greater degree
of personal contact, there will be
nine inanimate bags (stuffed
with sawdust) taking part, so it
should be a good do. Don't
forget the two boat races for
which the crews have been train-
ing three times a week before
lectures. They will certainly
appreciate all the support you
can give.
On Saturday morning, 10th
November, is the Lord Mayor's
Show. Guilds, as usual, is pro-
viding manpower for one of the
floats in the procsesion. There
will also be a strong contingent
of Guildsmen half-way up L u d -
gate Hill headed by Bo and the
President.
M r . Frank Irving, the well
known warden of Beit Hall, has
very kindly presented to the
Union one of his most valuable
and treasured possessions, a
Spanish water carrier. Owing to
a shortage of Spanish water, it is
now being used for English beer.
Whilst on the subject of trophies,
we would like to state categori-
cally that we have Mitch. He is
now resplendent in his new Coat
of Guilds—red on a field argent
with Mines rampant.
A t last we have acquired pre-
mises in E l for use as a Union
Office, and this should come into
operation as soon as possible.
The 1002nd night is November
23rd, when shrieks of delight will
be heard emanating from the
Union Buildings. Yes, it's the
Guilds Mines Carnival; bring
your own camel, any bloke with
less than five birds will not be
admitted.
You'd better get some sleep
now as the next fortnight is going
to be somewhat hectic.
This week's psuedonym—Jim
Sawdust.
P.S.—This year Christmas Day
is on December the twenty-fifth.
P.P.S.—WE G O T T H E T A ! !

The reason for our delay in
applying to join the E.E.C. was
simply that, when the Treaty of
Rome was signed in 1956, British
public opinion was just not ready
for entry.
He vividly compared the Cuban
crisis to that which would ensue
if, say, the Channel Islands some-
how came under Russian domi-
nation. " W e should then cer-
tainly hear demands for action by
the Government, similar to those
being heard now in America."
He explained his cancellation
of the Blue Water surface-
to-surface missile on the grounds
that there was already a
sufficiency of Tactical Nuclear
Weapons in Europe, and also
its sales prospects were poor be-
cause of competition from the
admittedly inferior but cheaper
and readily available American
Sergeant missile.
Asked about the possibility of
Government intervention to end
costly demarcation disputes in in-
dustry, M r . Thorneycroft said he
felt this would be disastrous :
"' They would probably all go on
strike." The Unions are slowly
becoming " less ultra-conserva-
tive," and this was a problem
which could only be dealt with
by the Trade Union movement
itself.
