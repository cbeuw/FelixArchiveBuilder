Imperial Institute
Road Closure
On Monday, 22nd October a
significant stage in the devel-
opment of the I C precinct in
Kensington was marked by the
closure of Imperial Institute
Road. This forms part of the
overall expansion approved bv
H . M Government i n 1952,
and in respect of which an out-
line planning scheme was pass-
ed by the L . C . C . in 1958. The
closure order was made recent-
ly by the Minister of Transport
under the Town and Country
Planning Act 1947.
While the actual highway was
closed to traffic on Monday, the
College, in agreement with the
lloeal authorities, is provSdiing
a Ithroughway for pedestrians
between Queen's Gate and E x -
hibition Boad from 6 a.m. to
11p.m., except on certain days
of the year.
They will pass through .the
College precinct, consisting of
buildings surrounding the
Queen's Tower, which will" re-
main as a campanile set in a
grassed quadrangle.

O n Tuesday, October 16th, the
Right Honourable Peter Thorney-
croft, M.P., Minister of Defence,
was the speaker at one of the
liveliest General Studies Lectures
which Imperial College has heard
for some time. A packed M a i n
Physics Lecture heard him an-
swer questions on many impor-
tant national and international
topics.
After a light-hearted reference
to his " chequered career "; at the
Board of Trade, the Exchequer,
the Ministry of Aviation and
now the Defence Ministry, M r .
Thorneycroft paid a graceful
tribute to the enormous advances
which modern science has made
possible. Then, after a speech of
only ten minutes he made the un-
precedented gesture of offering to
devote the remainder of his time
to answering questions from the
floor.
In reply to a question about
the British deterrent, he said that,
while admittedly Britain alone
could not hope to win a war with
Russia, Russia knows that we
could nonetheless inflict enor-
by D . Baume
mous devastation on her. The
total Western deterrent, however,
of which we at the same time
form a closely integrated part,
could without question defeat
Russia utterly, although only at
great cost.
He was confident that a shoot-
ing war would never take place ;
and he saw every possibility that
the West would win convincingly
the less spectacular but infinitely
preferable economic and ideo-
logical struggle for supremacy.
It was a tragic necessity that, in
view of Russia's avowed inten-
tion of destroying the capitalist
system, we are obliged to spend
vast fortunes to defend ourselves
while much of the world lives in
poverty and hunger.
Our entry into Europe, he felt,
was inevitable, and we must go
in right up to the hilt. There was
not a " hope in hell " that either
E . F . T . A . or the Commonwealth
could form a comparable free-
trade area, " except in the night-
mare of Lord Beaverbrook."

To-morrow, Thursday, 1 p.m.
in the Concert Hall, sees the
start of a new series of debates
throughout the year. The motion
before the house, ' T h e West is
fighting a losing battle' should
be of particular interest, in view
of the recent events on the inter-
national scene ; but of consider-
able interest, too, will be the
meeting of two distinct person-
alities^—on the one side, propos-
ing the motion, Brian Pollitt, the
first Communist President of the
Cambridge Union, and across the
table, politically slightly right,
Don Atkinson, President of U L U .
Many will remember Pollitt for
his extraordinary treatment just
prior to his examinations (and in-
cidentally the Union elections)
when he was badly beaten up.
A s a result of this action, which
probably did his cause more
good than harm, he dictated
answers to his exams from his
bed, and subsequently gained a
first in Economics, and the presi-
dency. Atkinson seems to have
taken a less perilous path to his
present position at U L U . A
member of the School of Oriental
and African Studies, with a
special interest in Japan, he is
what many would consider the
prototype student. His person-
ality is perhaps reflected in his
manner of speaking, in which he
uses quiet confidence and logic to
succeed where aggressive show-
manship so often fails.
Seconding Pollitt will be M r .
Turner of IC debating fame, and
speaking fourth, Michael
Coombs. The debate should
prove an excellent start to a pro-
gramme which includes a ' N o
confidence' motion on the 29th,
followed by the U L U debating
competitions. There will also be
a series of addresses on debating
technique by Finlay McPherson,
a well known figure in College
debates.
