Editorial comment
Staff-Student relations at I C
have always been rather dist-
ant, and to improve this situ-
ation this year, a series of int-
erviews with prominent mem-
bers of the College are planned.
The Rector very kindly consent-
ed to be the first subject, and
the report of an exclusive in-
terview will appear i n the next
edition of F E L I X .
There appears to be some
confusion as to the last day for
sending material for printing
in F E L I X . Any material should
be handed in to the Editor on
the Wednesday evening a week
before the date of issue. Type-
written scripts can be accepted
on the Thursday, but there is
always a risk that they will not
appear due to shortage of space.
As far as staff is concerned,
F E L I X still needs a typist,
male or female, with some
spare time and typing ability.
Anyone interested should con-
tact the Editor via the Union
Rack.

Sir,
There is a notice displayed in
the College advising " Don't
paddle your own canoe—Join
the Boat Club ! " The dubious
somatic merits of group physio-
therapy vis-a-vis the satisfaction
of conquering two-handed the
loneliness of the long-distance
paddler may be argued by the
moralist. But being of a brother-
hood which has paddled to Put-
ney, and then been remarkably
ill-received, my shoulder bears a
chip which could be planed down
a little if the ambiguous, or rather
misleading, title was changed to
The Imperial College Rowing
Club.
Soon a Morphyous mass of

I was thinking of doing some

Why is it that most members
of the Union Committee are in-
variably one over the eight after
ten ?

If Liddle and I have any differ-
ences, we will settle them in the

Shape of things
to come
by C. Liddle and B . Oldfleld.
From the chaos of I C Union Meetings over the past two years,
one single fact emerges; namely that I C is apathetic. This may
seem self-evident and many people have talked about it but little
has been done. T o create a lively and responsible Union, we must
first understand the root cause of the affliction.
We believe that the student is not naturally apathetic but that
he degenerates into an uninteresting and uninspired brown-bagger
after his arrival here. H e is submerged among 3,000 other students,
the second and third years do not deign to offer any help or advice,
whilst the post grads do not deign to leave their research benches
to add their more mature outlook and experience to the Union. If
the fresher attempts to approach an official of the Union, he is more
than likely to receive the ' cold shoulder,' and all the time lab reports
and problem sheets seem to pile up i n never diminishing mountains.
A n inflationary spiral of apathy Q t t M a
m«>tinc
sets i n , and this problem is met
by each generation of freshmen.
They may show sufficient interest,
to come to the first I C Union
meeting of the year, only to find
a complete lack of interest on the
part of the older students, as
shown by the poor attendance
and general lack of intelligent
debate. The freshmen stay away
from the next Union meeting and
the process of dissociation from
Union affairs begins. Is it really
his fault ?
Last year, the first Union meet-
ing of the session was the only
truly quorate one (the final one,
the A G M was quorate for about
five minutes). This year we hope
that the first Union meeting, on
November 6th, will be quorate
in order that there may be a dis-
cussion of the second ratification
of a motion proposing the reduc-
tion of the quorum to 300. (At
present set at 400.) Here we
have a fine admission of defeat
—that less than 10 per cent, of
us are worthy of the name ' stu-
dent ' i n all its implications. W e
are led to believe that this is the
leading scientific and techno-
logical institution i n the country,
but the job of such a College
should be to produce people of
character and sensibility rather
than animated slide rules. A live
Union is essential to a complete
r education: the reduction of the
quorum suggests not only a dead
Union, but. that the corpse has
been mouldering for some time.
We are not asking for a repeat
of the hysterical Union meeting
in May, 1960, when the quorum
was raised from 200 to 400 and
600 students were present. (It is
worth noting that a f this meeting,
the President was reinstated after
closed with ' A u l d Lang Syne'
and a vote of thanks a l l round.)
What we would like to see is
remedial support which stems
from a lively and intelligent
interest.
The second equally contro-
versial but less depressing item
on the agenda for the next Union
Meeting is the second approval
of the motion which will create
the post of Deputy President of
IC, who is to be elected i n the
same manner as the Hon. Secre-
tary. This was pushed through
at the last Union Meeting with
little or no explanation as to the
need for such an office. W e feel
that this position is an unneces-
sary addition to the numerically
quite adequate Council, and
would simply serve to enlarge
committees and duplicate paper
work. The I C Executive is able
to fulfil its duties without the
Parkinsonian addition of another
mouthpiece.
Turning from the blight of
apathy to the blight of hunger
(not Mooney), we come to the
third major topic on the agenda
of the coming Union Meeting.
The Union will have to decide to
what charity the proceeds of the
1963 Carnival shouldvgo. There
will be a motion before the house
that ' the sum raised should be
given to the Freedom from Hun-
ger Campaign,' and no doubt we
shall see the usual wrangle be-
tween those supporting local
charities and those in favour of
helping national campaigns. The
arguments in favour of the local
charities, such as help for the old
people of the district, are strong
and should not be overlooked i n
