It is somewhat reassuring or alarming
to see that whether in fiction or the
real world, we can still be confident
that some things stay the same.
There are many further issues in
the Harry Potter series to discuss,
including racial segreagation (wizards
vs. animals, wizards vs. muggles),
descrimination (pure-bloods vs.
muggleborns) and the media to name
but a few, but I do hope that this small
article has brought a happy end to a
slightly scary week.

fully last week, in the

about legions of
zombies laying waste to our towns and
cities, we present you the Felix Politics
Guide to the Ministry of Magic from the
Harry Potter Series.
The British Ministry of Magic is the
government responsible for every
magical being in the UK. It is lead by
an elected Minister for Magic who is
served by several heads of department.
The Ministry seems to be much smaller
that the muggle government, with the
departments sharing 10 floors in the
building.
In the books, the Ministry is presented
in various lights. We meet some Ministry
employees who seem to be very
competent, like the incumbent Minister
for Magic Kingsley Shacklebolt, who
we first meet as a distinguished Auror
and member of the Order of the Phoenix.
We also meet Arthur Weasley, a humble
hard working civil servant who has been

The Ministry of Magic
The Politics behind the wand
The Ministry of Magic is com-
prised of several offices, and is led by
the Minister for Magic.
The Minister is an elected official who
leads the heads of the departments
in the running of the Ministry.
Another responsibility of
the Minister is to liase with
the muggle Prime Minis-
ter. Similar to the PM,
the Minster for Magic
is supported by both
the Senior and Junior
Undersecretary for the
Minister for Magic. It is
not said how the minis-
ter is elected, however
each one seems to be an
independent candidate.

The big-
gest department in the Min-
istry of Magic. This department serves as
the Ministry’s arms of Law and Order. It is most simi-
lar to the muggle Justice department. This department is
responsible for a large number of portfolios, dealing with
wizarding law (via the Wizengamot), policing (via the Magi-
cal Law Enforcement Squad, the Auror Office and the
Hit Wizard department), the Improper Use
of Magic Office and others.

This depart-
ment is responsible for controlling
the fallout from major accidents while keeping the
muggle world unaware. It also deals with small scale magi-
cal accidents such as splinching and outbursts of acciden-
tal magic. It is formed of the Accidental Magic Reversal
Squad, the Obliviators and the Muggle-Wor-
thy Excuse Committee.

Similar to
the muggle Foreign Office, the
Department of International Magical Cooperation
maintains relations with foreign magical governments. The
department also regulates trading standards, dometic product
standards. It is also involved in representing Britain in the
International Confederation of Wizards, the magical
equivalent of the United Nations.

tin. It is formed of the Floo Network Authority, the Broom
Regualatory Control, the Portkey Office and the Apparition
Test Centre (similar to the muggle Driver and Ve-
hicle Licensing Agency).
Department of Magical Transportation

Similar to
a magical version of the De-
partment of Culture, Media and Sport, this de-
partment is in charge of Magical Sports in the United
Kindgom. Housing the British and Irish Quidditch League
Headquarters, the Offical Gobstones Club and the Ludicrous
Patents Office, this Department was integral to the the
UK’s hosting of both the 1994 Quidditch World
Cup Final and the 1994 Triwizard Tour-
nament.
Department of Magical Games and Sports

This department
is primarily concerned with magical re-
search, however in terms of security they are as secret as the
muggle intelligence services. Their staff, the Unspeakables, investi-
gate concepts such as Death, Time, Space and Prophecy in
the lowest level of the Ministry Building.
Department of Mysteries
Department of Mysteries
assigned to the small and little respected
Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office. He
represents a man who is above scheming
and office politics, yet suffers with a
lack of career progression. Finally we
meet characters such as former Minister
Cornelius Fudge, a man who seems to
have to sole ambition to stay in power
at all costs. The Ministry of Magic is
generally seen as corrupt, often using
it’s strong Berlusconi-esque influence
on the Daily Prophet (Britain’s most
popular wizarding newspaper) to spread
propaganda or discredit it’s opponents.
The Ministry has suffered from several
scandals in recent years, including poor
security with its most secure department
being easily broken into by six
schoolchildren and also several terrorists.
Also, under the reign of Cornelius
Fudge the Ministry of Magic instigated
a draconian crackdown on the staff and
students of Hogwarts School with Fudge
fearing that the school’s Headmaster
was after his job. Incompetence and
little regard for evidence also leads to
the Ministry falsely imprisoning several
people, from Sirius Black, a man sent to
Azkaban prison without a trial, to Stan
Shunpike who was imprisoned during the
second war against Voldemort to inspire
He is not morally corrupt, however
his appeasing of the people and lack
of strategic decision-making allowed
the Death Eaters to infiltrate and take
over the government, ending with his
assassination.
The third Minister we meet is Minster
Kinglsey Shacklebolt, a supporter
of Harry Potter and a man seeming
unentangled with corruption or
desperation. He is elected at the end of
the war against Voldemort and signifies
change in government and an end to
corruption with more success than
President Obama.
Joseph Letts welcomes you to the Ministry of Magic...
The Wizarding
High Court of Law, the Wizengamot
is involved in both the trials of dangerous criminals as
well as the passing of wizarding laws. Lead by the Chief Warlock,
this body consists of approximately 50 members. The Minister for Mag-
ic seems to have some influence in the selection of members. During
trials the Wizengamot is presided over by the Minister for Magic,
the Minister’s Senior Undersecretary and the Head of the
Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
The Wizengamot

This depart-
ment is responsible for keeping
magical animals out of the sight of muggles. They
are also responsible for controlling or dispatching danger-
ous animals and they enforce the 1965 Ban on Experimental
Breeding. The deaprtment contains separate Beast, Being
and Spirit Devisions as well as offices such as the
Goblin Liason Office.

The Minister for Magic
In the Harry Potter Universe we meet
several Ministers for Magic with
different traits. We first meet Minister
Cornelius Fudge, a man most concerned
with keeping the public happy, often at
the cost of the truth. He happily uses his
power as Minister for Magic to discredit
both Harry Potter and Headmaster
Albus Dumbledore who claim that
Dark Lord Voldemort and his terrorist
group the Death Eaters have returned to
destabilize society. Fearing the truth he
uses his influence over the media and
political power to slander them, while
also removing Dumbledore’s official
positions. He is also happy to accept
bribes and suggestions from rich socialite
Lucius Malfoy, a man whose influence
in the Ministry of Magic resembles the
power of Rupert Murdoch. The second
Minister we meet is Minister Rufus
Scrimgeour, a former head of the Auror
Office. Minister Scrimgeour also misled
the public, using the media to pretend
the Ministry was making significant
progress in the war against Voldemort.
