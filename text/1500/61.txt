‘Moral victory’ for ICCC
Seven of Imperial Cricket’s finest jour-
neyed down to a barn in Hertfordshire
last week Saturday only to come away
with a moral victory after losing both of
their games.
The fact that everyone made it to the
barn in Hertfordshire alive was a posi-
tive start to the day given the driving
skills of vice-captain Majid Ali. When
asked about whether the kit- bags were
stacked too high in his car, he respond-
ed with the words: “I don’t need to see,
that’s fine”.
The first match against Middlesex
started off steadily for Imperial and the
game was evenly poised.Two swift run-
outs of ‘keeper Vishal Nair and token-
white-guy Iain Stobbs turned the tide
against IC, but the screw was really
turned when the Middlesex albino Sikh
off-spinner went for a miserly fifteen
runs in his of three overs. A competi-
tive 114 was posted in the end with sig-
nificant contributions from v/c Majid
“extra-hot Nandos” Ali and Jayanth “I
lost my lunch” Ganapathy. IC came out
with aggression in the field but calm
batting from the opposition and a drop
in our own fielding standards meant an
easy win for Middlesex.
One change was made for the second
game against UCL (or Euston Tech.)
with Iain “token” Stobbs making way
for Hasit “hungover from halloween”
Mehta. Majid used the fuel from his
Nandos the previous night and 25 cans
of coke to attack his ULU team- mate
Willy Pete who opened the bowling for
Euston Tech. Ably helped by Vishal
and Navin Surtani, the innings fin-
ished on 143 from twelve overs. Once
again though, the opposition batting
was calm. Despite a caught and bowled
from Navin along with some direct
hit run- outs from skipper Ahsaan and
Hasit - Euston Tech managed to win in
a tight contest.
Even though the inexperienced team
had been defeated, it gave the newer
and younger guys a lot of invaluable ex-
perience to take forward for next year’s
tournament. Positives were taken and
the weaknesses of the performances
analysed with a view to coming into the
2012/13 tournament a better prepared
and more experienced unit.
