The aim with Slitherlink is to make one
continuous closed loop by connecting the
dots. The numbers in each square indi-
cate how many edges of the square are
part of the loop, so if it contains a “2”,
you know that two and only two out of
four edges have lines. That’s all the info
you need to get the one logical answer
(though waiting a week to see the solu-
tion will also do). Answers to puzzles.fe-
lix@imperial.ac.uk, as the puzzles team
recieves one shower per correct solution.

Word Wheel
Make as many words of at least
4 letters as you can, always using the
central one. NO plurals, conjugated
verbs, comparatives or superlatives,
because I said so.. There is always at
least one 9 letter word.
