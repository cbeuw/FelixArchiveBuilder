walnut toilet seat made me
feel ‘clarsey’. As we sat
down, we almost imag-

made the experience slightly less realistic.
There’s even a 5 year guarantee, not that
any civilised man/woman would keep a toi-
let seat for that long. However, it beats Ar-
gos’frankly pitiful 2 year warranty.
This is not the bottom of the range. The
walnut means that the toilet seat is always

The latter being the worst, as we don’t want

FELIX Friday 04 November 2011 53
After 62 years of students desperately trying to cut
their hedges in misguided angst, finally, help is at
hand. Whether it’s trimming your bush or acquiring a
hoe to work that fertile ground, the Home & Garden
section will give you the tool to perfecting your house.
And we’re not talking about Kevin McCloud.
(This section is a joke, right? – Ed)
It took 1500 issues to get there...
Moving to a new house, coupled with
a housemate’s neurotic obsession for
dry floors, meant that we were in the
market for a new shower curtain and
rail this year. Naturally, I use ‘in the
market’ in the very loosest sense of
the term – the purchasing philosophy
for the house runs along the lines of
‘find the cheapest shit money can buy,
and get it delivered free’. This much
revered train of student thought led to
us buying the ‘140-260 cm Telescopic
Shower Curtain Rail - Stainless Steel’
a week ago. Setting us back £12 in
total, we weren’t expecting much and
the product completely met our ex-
pectations.
The shower rail does match the
product description. It’s 140-260 cm
long and it does in fact telescope. Af-
ter that it does little else. It separated
itself into three parts when we opened
the packet, possibly an exciting puz-
zle, possibly a lesson in the perils of
thrift. Once re-assembled, one in-
stalls the shower curtain by jamming
it against either end of the wall and
then hoping it holds. Hope, I find, is
a central theme of using this product
- much like an alcoholic uncle, one
wishes the best for it but really can-
not see anything other than pain and
destruction in the future.
The ‘140-260 cm Telescopic Show-
er Curtain Rail - Stainless Steel’ has
been built for a world of geometric
certainties and square edges, a world
I’m afraid our bathroom doesn’t op-
erate in. Trying to jam the rail be-
tween two walls that aren’t parallel
to one another inevitably results in
Dear Sir,
I hope you may be of assistance. I have
been happily dating this cute 3rd year for
1 year and 46 days (yes, I’ve been count-
ing). But on Tuesday, I skipped my stats
lecture to return to my Hammersmith bed-
sit and surprise my boyfriend with an early
evening dinner and cosy winter cuddle. I
found him on the bed with a skanky fresh-
er bint. He’d been tossing her around the
room, the Ikea cupboard was smashed to
pieces. I’m in a complete state, I just don’t
know what to do. Please advise.
Yours,
Janey Ray
Dear Janey,
That’s just awful. I’ve lost a lot of
sleep over this problem. It highlights all
that is wrong with the European com-
mon market. Ikea furniture is cheap for
a reason. You’d be far better off kick-
ing those tyres and lighting those fires
by spending a bit extra at Habitat on
something that will last forever. Furni-
ture should be an investment, don’t hold
back! Go wild!
I hope this helps.
Regards,

for those t h a t

you wish

fresco, gaz-
ing wistfully at t h e
stars or the next door neighbour.
Whilst this product does scrape the bot-
tom of the barrel – but then, you’re buy-
ing one of the cheapest items from a pretty
cheap catalogue, so you get what you de-
serve – it does do the job. The seat may be
a bit chilly in the morning, so probably best
to let your flatmate use it first if you’re of a
fragile disposition.
O
h, it’s morning. Last
night, your sister’s hot
friend – the one you’ve
been thinking about for
weeks – stayed over.
You know this is your chance.
But she barely knows

gesture – something

shock- ing. At
break- fast, you
sidle up t o
her: “Hey
Jennifer, after
you’re done
with that,
fancy watch-
ing me defecate
in decadence?”
For most, a simple plastic or wooden
seat is enough to satisfy their needs. But
there are those few who simply demand
more. To cater for those rare, singular,
distant souls, there is the Upholstered
Rhinestone Toilet Seat.
You might well
ask: “Why exactly
does your toilet
seat need to
be wrapped
in three

feet of

and then
studded with 15

you’re probably not the sort of chap that
likes to sit down when you have a wee.
This throne is for those that like to treat
themselves, those of a refined, regal
taste. Everyone else, go hang with the
Argos proles while we play croquet.
the curtain being glued to your arse
while washing your front. Although
the seductive touch of polyester-on-
bum might do it for some people, I’m
afraid I’m not one of them.
The shower curtain itself is so thin
one could cut oneself on it, and it’s
so light that I would compare it to an
Elven cloak, except for the fact that
it’s shit.
In conclusion, purchase the ‘140-
260 cm Telescopic Shower Curtain

ing for a little bit of excitement in
your life. Be it re-assembling the pre-
broken curtain rod or showering un-
der the peril of a concussion, there’s
wholesome fun to be had here for the
entire household.
