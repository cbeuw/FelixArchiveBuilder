Early BUCS loss for 8-ball
The university cue sports season began last
weekend in dramatic fashion as an inexpe-
rienced Imperial College English eight-ball
pool team travelled up to Nottingham for the
inaugural English Universities Pool Champi-
onships. Hosted by the Nottingham University
Snooker and Pool Club, 25 university teams
and over 128 individual entrants battled it out
for some early bragging rights.
However, the competition was almost over
for Imperial before it started. Team member
Max Chalmers overslept and, along with fellow
teammate Alex Lambrianos, almost missed the
train, arriving at Kings Cross station only five
minutes before the departure time.
That first minor drama of the weekend was
not the only consequence of the early start for
the team, with the majority having to wake up
at 4am on the Saturday. By the time of arrival
at Rileys, the tournament venue, tiredness was
already creeping in and four of the five team
members were immediately knocked out of
the Individual Championships. Only team
captain, Elwin Carlos, survived past the first
round, comfortably beating both Adam Gray
(Bangor 1) and Connor Thorogood (Warwick
2) by the same 2-0 score line to set up a last 32
clash with Ben Parslew (Manchester 1).
Carlos continued his decent form to take
the first frame of the third round match but
Parslew, who later lost to eventual winner,
Tom Barrett (Nottingham 1), stormed back
with a solid clearance in the second. Some as-
tute tactical play in the following two frames
earned Parslew a 3-1 victory to knock out the
Imperial captain.
Things became considerably worse when
Imperial came up against Warwick 1s in the
Team Championship group stage. A cool and
composed performance from late riser Max
Chalmers was enough to prevent a whitewash
but it did little to detract from an embarrassing
9-1 defeat for Imperial.
It was a fairly dejected Imperial team that left
Rileys that evening. Cue a nice relaxing meal
at Nando’s, followed by Match of the Day and
a good night’s sleep at the Igloo Hostel, where
the team attempted to recover from the horrors
of the day just gone (all except Captain Carlos,
who refused to share a double bed with another
guy and consequently spent the night curled up
on a sofa in the foetal position).
All of the above proved to be the perfect
tonic as the team had a much improved second
day at the tournament.
Carlos opened the match against a vastly
experienced Manchester 2 side with a win
against opposing team captain Andy Fores.
Later, Andrew Leung potted some outrageous
balls, including a full-length double on the
black, to put Imperial 2-1 up.
Manchester fought back to take a 5-3 lead
but Lambrianos and Shyam Pankhania both
won their final frames in convincing fashion to
rescue a draw for Imperial.
The result, however, was not enough to qual-
ify for the knockout stages of the Team Cham-
pionship. Instead, Imperial dropped into the
Quarter Finals of the Team Plate, where they
faced another strong team in Birmingham 1s.
Imperial got off to a cracking start and raced
into a 4-0 lead; the most notable performance
coming from Leung, who once again displayed
a knack for potting ridiculous balls to stun ar-
guably Birmingham’s best player, Mike Rich-
ards.
However, a spectacular collapse by Imperial
and an equally resurgent performance from the
Birmingham team saw the former improbably
snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. Missed
blacks and botched clearances from everyone
in the Imperial team ensured a 4-6 loss to the
eventual runners-up.
Despite the miserable nature of the defeat, as
well as some of the poor performances on the
Saturday, every member of the team thorough-
ly enjoyed the weekend and gained some in-
valuable experience ahead of the season finale,
the BUCS Pool Championships in February.
Many thanks should go to the Nottingham
University Snooker and Pool Club for organis-
ing a fantastic tournament and, no doubt, Im-
perial will return stronger next year.
As for the performance this time around,
it was succinctly summed up by Chalmers:
“[We’ve] had an absolute shocker!”

The (actual) League table is back! It doesn’t have all the
teams in it yet, as some of you haven’t played yet...but will
be updated every week.
Apology
We screwed up last week, and last
year’s final league table made its
way into the paper. Sorry!
