I
must say; I was rather taken
aback by the hullabaloo caused
by my (somewhat overempha-
sised) opinions when I reviewed
the Jeremy Kyle show a few
weeks ago, and for that, I extend my
apologies to anyone who was offended
by it. I have never professed to be any
good at this writing malarkey – evi-
dently my tongue-in-cheek style and
exaggeration were not recognised by
some people. Oh well!
For those of you unaware, in short,
my article said that the point of the Jer-
emy Kyle show is to make you laugh at
the participants (this is patently obvi-
ous from every single camera shot of
the audience). It also highlighted the
fact that it elevates the viewer’s ego. I
may have also vaguely mentioned my
opinion that not many participants are
actually good, decent, hardworking
people (it really was very subtle, I’d be
surprised if you noticed it).
As expected there was some nega-
tive feedback online... slightly more
than anticipated but nevertheless, these
things happen! I think my favourite
comment was as follows: “[I] hope
to never see such awful dehumanisa-
tion and hideous treatment of fellow
humans in Felix again”. Other com-
mentators generally flocked towards
this opinion and thus a prevailing hy-
pothesis was formed; that I, George
Barnett, am entirely to blame for the
way in which guests on the Jeremy
Kyle show are portrayed, treated and
“dehumanised”.
If, by enjoying the show for the mer-
its in which the producers expect it
to be enjoyed, I am dehumanising the
guests, then what on Earth are Jeremy
Kyle and the ITV production crew do-
ing to them? Helping them? No, that’s
not it. Well not entirely anyway. Bait-

Aresponse to all of the critics
ing them to provide entertainment for
others? Oh, there we go! Even ‘Angry
Geek’ pointed out that “the production
team heavily cherrypick their guests to
maximise whatever effect they’re go-
ing for that week”. It seems then, that
we, the blissfully ignorant viewer, have
fallen into ITV’s cunning program-
ming trap! Oh, damn and blast!
Many of the negative comments on
my article pointed the finger at me –
fair enough, I wasn’t exactly polite
about the guests – but they didn’t point
the finger at anyone else who watches
the Jeremy Kyle show. Surely they are
as much to blame as I am? Okay maybe
not quite as much... Nevertheless, here
is a question for those people: how
many of you have written to ITV to
complain about how The Jeremy Kyle
Show dehumanises, mistreats and gen-
erally makes a mockery of its guests?
It would be much to my surprise if any
of you had even thought about doing
such.
It’s all well and good telling me that
I’m in the wrong for the tone I used, or
how “vile and hateful” my review was,
but what use is that? It may dissuade
me, or even someone else, from writ-
ing articles of a similar ilk for the next
few months. But what’s the point if
people continue to watch the show for
what it is – “human bear baiting”? Too
many people are willing to point the
finger and condemn the actions of oth-
ers solely for the purpose of occupying
what they perceive to be the moral high
ground. If you negative commentators
really believe in what you said, then all
I ask of you is to write to ITV and com-
plain about the show.
I have to say, it was much to my
delight when the following week, a
certain apoplectic nerd took it upon
themself to write an article which was
Y
ou may notice a story
I ran in the Science
section last week re-
garding a study which
linked the amount of
Facebook friends to the size of an indi-
vidual’s grey matter. It is interesting to
note that there have been many studies
which have correlated changing brain
structures to internet usage. Although
we must not misinterpret correlation as
causation in any case, we can discuss
the potential implications.
I guess you could call me a bit of a
social butterfly. I try to maintain vari-
ous social circles and keep up with
friends.
My Facebook profile? Similar story.
I tend to add friends of friends who
I meet in Real Life, I guess I’m a bit
trigger happy with the add button. As a
result, my news feed is an amalgama-
tion of approximately 830 people from
college and beyond.
I used to be strictly opposed to join-
ing Facebook (classing it the same as
MySpace). I decided to give it a go and
noticed myself adopting new traits.
Often, when I check the news feed,
I feel compelled to scroll down to the
point at which I last checked it. If I
happen to see anything particularly in-
teresting, I bring it up to the relevant
friendship group offline. One could
argue an internal schema of a friend’s
online presence is built in memory,
and although one may see their friends
in the real world often, the online pres-
ence is somewhat loosely attached and
adds another dimension to the interac-
tion structure.
It’s this extra dimension on top of ba-
sic interaction which provides the ba-
sis for my suggestion that if our brain
structures are being modified slowly
by internet usage, then this could very
well be the next stage of evolution for
man. We often can’t quite put our fin-
ger on the various underlying assump-
tions we make when detecting emotion
during online chat, and how our brains
in essence a personal attack aimed di-
rectly at me. Which is fine, because it
was much more interesting than the
usual shit churned out by aforemen-
tioned author (sorry, but I don’t think
I’m the only one with this opinion). So
if my article was condemned for being
offensive...then why was it okay for
the cowardly Angry Geek to write an
offensive article directly aimed at me
behind the refuge of their cheap nom
de plume?
Angry Geek “hates us all” (this is
supposedly a “baseline”) – surely
there’s reason for this hate? Do we not
share your opinions about something,
Mr. Angry? I’m guessing not. That’s
why you hate us, because we don’t
agree with you, right? Are we not wor-
thy of being your equals oh esteemed
angry one?
You’ll have to bear with me for the
rest of this paragraph, I fear that some
of you may not agree... right – here
goes. The way I see it is that, by hat-
ing everyone (for whatever reason it
may be), you segregate yourself from
everyone else, which by default creates
a divide. Now, whether you consider
yourself above, below or even aside
from everyone else, you are still sepa-
rated from them. Still with me? Good.
So saying that I promote inequality is
a bit sanctimonious and hypocritical,
isn’t it?
My conclusion is two-fold. To those
negative commentators: if you’re go-
ing to do something, then do something
worthwhile. Don’t write personal com-
ments or attacks from your perceived
moral high ground. Take action against
the root of the problem, ITV, not the
intermediary. And to Angry Geek, I put
it to you to join us, stop being a coward
and reveal your identity! Enlighten us.
Come on, it’ll be fun! You know you
want to! We can have a proper debate
about what really annoys us instead
of communicating like monkeys with
typewriters.
are being affected is uncertain.
The ever-increasing barrage of infor-
mation we consume from a wide gam-
ut of devices presents a challenge for
all of our minds. Our episodic memory
is essentially extended to virtual hap-
penings and we potentially remember
more than we thought we could. Ul-
timately, adding 500 people to your
Facebook profile tomorrow isn’t go-
ing to boost your memory, but keep-
ing track of their activities might help
make it more fluid over time. Let’s
hope a future generation, which may
look back to our collective online con-
sciousness, can see it as an advance-
ment rather than a great waste of time.
