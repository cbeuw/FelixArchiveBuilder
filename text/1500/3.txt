IC Radio was shut down last Friday
after the college received a serious
complaint following a show in which
the presenters discussed the “dirty
little secrets” of an unnamed student
organisation. The complaint is thought
to have been from a former or current
committee member of the organisation
who stated that their primary objection
to the programme was “defamation of
character”. The show, which aired on
Sunday 23 October, has since been re-
moved from the IC Radio website.
Hamza Shaikh, a fourth year Impe-
rial student, and Ibad Rizvi, a student
at UCL, who hosted the controversial
show later told Felix that they felt an
“obligation to expose the corruption
of the organisation and protect stu-
dents.”
During the show, Shaikh described

how “charity money [raised by the
organisation] that was supposed to be
used to support flood victims in Paki-
stan was used to fund business class
tickets to fly friends from Pakistan to
London, and that total cost was around
£16,000.” Rizvi later told Felix, “It
still haunts me that [this organisation]
isn’t registered as a charity, but they
still do charity events. Where does all
the money go?”
Shaikh and Rizvi also stated that
there is a lack of democracy within
the organisation, using one example
of the events manager being promoted
to the position of manager with no
elections. Shaikh exclaimed, “Talk
about democracy, shall we?” He went
on to say that the organisation “is not
backed by anyone, students assign
each other roles, there is no merit in-
volved, no competence.”
Meanwhile, Shaikh and Rizvi feel
that they were well within their rights
to have such a discussion, stating:
“It’s free media and we were express-
ing our opinions. And anyway, we
don’t have anything personal against
these people. We’re just saying what
other people say.”
The pair is adamant not to let any
complaints put them off doing similar
shows in the future. Shaikh told Fe-
lix that, “I really like to use radio in a

Records broken at annual
bike auction
This Monday saw the Union conduct a
bike auction in Beit Quad, raising over
£7000 for RAG; a new record. 106
bikes and one scooter were up for sale,
having been left chained to railings
and bike racks around campus, pre-
sumably abandoned by their owners.
This year, Sport Imperial had a hand
in the proceedings, with head Neil
Mosley acting as auctioneer. Armed
with a megaphone, he ran a competi-
tive auction, driving the prices up.
There were a fair amount of decent
bikes on offer, the star of the show be-
ing a Trek road bike going for £355.
Two other bikes were also sold for
over £300, and a quirky lime-green
Fixie bike was sold for just under
£200.
The auction was well attended by
Indy Leclercq both staff and students, with atten-
dance in Beit Quad reaching a peak at
12:30, when the best bikes were being
sold. It wasn’t just shiny, barely used
merchandise on offer though; some
bargains were had towards the end of
the auction, with a couple of mountain
bikes going for barely £50. The cheap-
est item sold was a frame, for a mere
£6.
The final total, in excess of £7000
(RAG were unable to give an exact
number, as not all the money had been
collected at the time of printing), is
the highest ever for a bike auction and
more than was raised by the whole of
RAG in the 2008-09 academic year.
RAG would like to thank everyone
who came along, as well as security
and Union staff for their help. To the
successful bidders: enjoy your new
bike!
productive way. If we hear of corrup-
tion again, we will talk about it.” Rizvi
added, “There are a lot of people who
want to expose [this organisation], but
not everyone has the opportunity.”
This marks the second shutdown in
a year following a similar event last
February following a complaint made
to the Rector regarding the use of ra-
cially offensive language during a
broadcast.
The Station Manager at IC radio,
Aislinn Hayes, has reminded all so-
ciety members that they are respon-
sible for what they (or anyone else on
their show) say on air. She added that,
“Something like this could really hurt
the reputation of the establishment,
so IC Radio will always help in these
situations.”
Hayes also told the members of IC
Radio to keeping having “lots of fun”
and “don’t let something like this
scare you off doing your banterous
shows.”
“If we hear of
corruption again, we
will talk about it.”
