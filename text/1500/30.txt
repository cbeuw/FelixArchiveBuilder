Living in London is seen as expensive by most people. So I thought I’d put together
a blog listing how you can maintain a high standard of living, but on the cheap as a
student in London!
Just to note, even though Imperial College Union isn’t part of the NUS (long story,
for a brief history of Imperial and the NUS read the Imperial College Union page on
Wikipedia) there are still loads of deals and more effective ways to save money in
London.
There are too many to list here in Felix so I have put them on my blog at
imperialcollegeunion.org/blogs. But here are a few of the best ones!

During the freshers period of joining
University it is often easy to get caught
up with the freedom of it all and as there
is not much studying at this time to think
that University is great and one of the
most enjoyable experiences of your lives
and for most people it will be.
So now, four weeks into term what
can you do if it’s all not going to plan? If
you are struggling to settle in, unhappy
with your course, struggling to make
friends, unhappy with the standard of
accommodation in halls, what can you
do?
Imperial College Union offers a totally
independent service called The Advice
Centre which can help you with these

Cooke and he is trained to deal with the

TheAdvice Centre
• Housing rights
• Academic appeals and complaints

City mapper is a seriously impressive
transport website for London that
makes the TFL website look like Lycos
search vs Google. Just put in where
you want to go and where from (or
click “Locate Me”) and it’ll calculate
times, costs, distance covered and
even how many calories you could
burn using different modes of
transport.

The easiest way to buy cheap train
tickets online with NO booking fees
or delivery charges. It has a intuitive
interface that makes booking tickets
simple and quick.
The Advice Centre can
also act on your behalf
with any issue you do not
feel you can adequately
solve yourself. For example
if you are in dispute with a
landlord or the college we can
email, write letters or speak to
them on your behalf with your
permission.
The centre also has a large supply
of condoms and personal attack
alarms that are available free to
students. The centre is based on
the mezzanine level of the Union
building in the Student Activities
Centre and works on both a drop-in
and appointment basis, which means
you can just turn up and if the adviser is
available, you will be seen straight away.
So if something has gone wrong or you
just need some information on the College
or local area please do not hesitate to
contact us, let The Advice Centre find the
answers to your questions.
