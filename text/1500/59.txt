My, my! Look at the size of
your nonogram this week! This
is how we celebrate 1500 issues,
baby!
The cells in a grid have to be
coloured or left blank accord-
ing to numbers at the side of the
grid.
The numbers measure how
many unbroken lines of filled-
in squares there are in any given
row or column. Look at last
week’s solution to see what a
typical solution looks like.
The overall solution should
yield some sort of picture, or
as good as a picture can look in
monochrome on a 20x20 grid.
As usual, answers to puzzles.

Welcome to another round of cryptograms. I’ll say first off that the quotations may
be considered highbrow, so this is not for the unfaint hearted puzzle lover. Leave
now if you wish.
So, we have here an encoded quotation. It’s a very simple code, so each unique
letter stands for one different unique letter. Use your powers of deduction and
perhaps a little guesswork to deduce the quotation and the name of the person who
said it. Use the grid and scribble space below to record what letters you’ve already
figured out.
