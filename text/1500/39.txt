Something brilliant from the terrible Midlands
Black & white bearer
A preliminary
time scale for
the evening...
A
lot has been said over the
years about Operation
Midnight Climax. Some
have called them the
saviours of rock music,
others have called them evil space de-
mons hell-bent on destroying humanity.
I would say there is truth in both those
statements.
As I pulled up to Velux Sombrito,
OMC’s labyrinthian studio-cum-disco
palace, I can feel an overwhelming
sense of dread coming over me. “Must
be the tacos,” I thought to myself. I
was greeted at the door by Mister Pip-
pensworth, OMC’s butler (officially)
and spokesman (unofficially). I am told
that none of the members of OMC will
attend the interview, not because they
have forgotten, but simply – as Mis-
ter Pippensworth put it – because they
“couldn’t give a flying fuck”. I started
to wonder whether it was worth staying
at all. Pippensworth sat me down on a
derelict, silver-stained sofa and left the
room. The place was wretched, but also
kind of sweet. Pippensworth arrived
back with a suspicious-looking purple
mojito, stirring it with a rusty spoon. He
handed the drink to me. Before I could
even taste it, I smelt it. The stench filled
my nostrils and I vomited all over my
brand new slacks. “Sorry, I had tacos on
the way here” I mumbled through my
crusty goatee. Pippensworth started to
laugh maniacally, and so the interview
began.

Seymour Dicks catches up with Operation Midnight Climax’s
personal butler ahead of their reapparition at KABLAAM
Mister Pippensworth: They’re not
real you know.
Seymour Dicks: I’m sorry?
MP: Operation Midnight Climax.
They’re a concept. An ideal. A groove.
Not a band.
SD: I see… Tell me more about the
groove.
MP: Years ago the plates shifted: this
lead to increased magnetism over key
hotspots in the Atlantic Ocean. The plan
was to use these to re-route the Earth’s
inner melody…
SD: “The Earth’s inner melody”?
What the hell are you talking about?
MP: It’s everything really. It’s a key.
If you can play just the right frequency
at the right moment in time, you can lit-
erally blow people’s minds.
SD: … And this is what OMC is try-
ing to do?
(Silence)
MP: No, OMC just plays catchy pro-
gressive ska. Explosive rock some call
it. Personally I think it’s shit.
SD: Don’t be so hard on them, they’re
Not Indigo will keep things
cozy between the sets
musical geniuses.
MP: You try being their butler for a
day, see how much you like it. They did
things to me. Horrible, horrible things.
SD: Let’s get back to the topic at
hand… OMC have a gig coming up on
the 12th November…
MP: Let me interrupt you right
there…
SD: No.
MP: Let me interrupt you right
there…
SD: Okay.
MP: They prefer the term “séance”.
SD: What?
MP: OMC’s next “séance” is on the
12th November.
SD: Right, yes. At Metric then.
MP: Yes, an age-old favourite. A ma-
ture, strong scent. Something vicious.
SD: What do you foresee?
MP: So, so many heads. All of them
blown. Like the jackhammer to your
watermelon.
SD: That’s hot.
As I spoke the words, my head tilted
backwards and my eyes slowly wrapped
upon themselves. I woke up the next
day in my bed, covered in blood, sur-
rounded by what appeared to be goat
entrails. Or genitals. As I searched for
the source of the bleeding, I realised the
initials O.M.C had been carved into my
chest. I brought my right hand closer to
my face: I was holding a blood-splat-
tered rusty spoon. “Damn,” I thought.
“They’re good”.

FELIX Friday 04 november 2011 39
Anyone familiar with the UK indepen-
dent hardcore scene will know of the
untimely demise of the mighty Blakfish
two years ago. This crippling shot to the
nuts did however have one positive; the
birth of Brummie trio &U&I (not like an
actual weird birth of three fully grown,
bearded men at the same time, just like…
shut up, you know what I mean).
Constructed from the 3 remaining
members of Blakfish, their sound is just
as raw while remaining strangely catchy
and comforting. Light Bearer is their de-
but full-length release and a jolly good
one at that. The album, released on 21st
October 2011 on ondryland records has
been labelled with many genres from in-
die to mathcore but all you need to know
is that it’s super fucking sweet. Everyone
knows hardcore bands are awesome. it’s
just a fact, and while this band may not
be strictly hardcore, this fact definitely
applies to them.
Buy this album, whack it in the old
walkman and put on your headphones,
after a short intro you will start to feel
a funny sensation. It doesn’t take long
to realise that this is your face being
punched in so hard that it’s pulled off
of your skull and melted with a massive
fucking piece of fire. Or something. Then
just while you’re in the midst of this ri-
diculous onslaught of grinding riffs and
irregular time signatures, you hit the
centre-piece of the album, the eye of
the storm, a track entitled ‘Super Five’.
The chilling softness of the song allows
you to recuperate slightly and relax your
pummelled eardrums. However this
sense of security is short lived as you are
yet again propelled into the sheer chaos
that is ‘Light Bearer’.
The album has you reaching for the re-
peat button as it continues to amaze until
the very end of the climactic final number
‘Above the Abyss’ with Adebisi Shank
guitarist Lar Kaye chipping in for good
measure. While the album does have a
hardcore vibe running throughout, almost
every track has gentle, angular guitar
parts and memorable vocal melodies in-
tertwined. The construction of conflicting
sounds makes this release an absolute
must-have for anyone. If you have been
at all interested by this incredibly poorly
constructed piece of written information
(thanks science) then buy this album now
(either on iTunes or andyouandi.net).
Think of it this way, you can either buy
this album or continue to spend your stu-
dent loan on vast amounts of cheap beer,
cheap porn and cheap food. Do you lit-
erally want to become a mega drunkard
masturbating lardman? Yes? That’s sick,
and something else sick is that you can
often find &U&I doing shows in London
and if you happen to see one advertised
then go, the shows are even better than
the album. Seriously, buy this album, go
to a show, if you don’t love it then at least
you can be safe in the knowledge that you
are dead inside. Every cloud, eh.
