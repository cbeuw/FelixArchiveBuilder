HOW POPULAR
ARE YOU?
We went back in the archives to give you some old school Hangman.
We’re so swagged out we’re not even copy editing this bitch
Horoscopes
Scorpio
This week you’re a postgraduate
student marker. You receive an email
encouraging quality feedback but
banning defecation. You decide to go
round the house of the person whose
script you are marking, hold a gun
to his head and scream “ENGLISH
MOTHERFUCKER, DO YOU SPEAK
IT?”
Aries
This week you realise that you hate
science. Unfortunately you’re actually
20 minutes into your PhD viva by
this point. You come to your senses
the following Tuesday in a blood
spattered union minibus driving across
the Scottish highlands with your two
assessors dead on the back seats.
Taurus
This week you’re a postgraduate student
doing marking work. After the 700th
email from the head of physics about
improving the quality of “feedback for
the student” you decide to take a shit
on the manuscript you’re marking. That
should get the point across.
Gemini
This week you’re an embryonic stem
cell. Oh the limitless possibilities, you
could be a neural cell, a heart valve, an-
ything! You feel the hormone solution
wash over you and to your horror realise
that you’ve been turned into a fucking
knee cap.
Cancer
This week you’re a physics final year
student who just received a marked lab
report covered in what appears to be
fecal matter. At that moment the NSS
call you and ask about the quality of the
feedback. You say that it’s ambiguous.
Leo
This week you’re sat in the lab wonder-
ing why on earth you’re wasting all the
embryonic stem cells you’ve been given
on making replacement Knee Caps. You
resolve to never accept grant money
from the Mafia again.
Virgo
This week you are the PA to the Dean
of Education. When asked by a journal-
ist why Imperial has yet again slipped in
the student satisfaction survey you point
out that IC endevours to make it to num-
ber 2 on feedback. It’s unconvincing.
Libra
This Friday you are in the Holland
Club. After your fourth whisky you
realise that when you die you want to
have an Irish Wake here in the style of
“The Wire”. After your 9th whisky you
decide to go to the union to get a change
of scenery. You trip on the ramp and roll
gently back down to the bar. Cursing,
you buy another whisky.
Sagittarius
This week you work for college estates.
An agitated Biochem researcher calls
up and says a lock needs replacing and
lists it as high priority. As everyone
lists their estates jobs as high priority
you ignore it and get back to playing
angry birds and pissing around with the
heating.
Capricorn
This week you’re eating a Big Kahuna
Burger when John Travolta and Samuel
L. Jackson bust into your front room
and SLJ starts reciting a passage
from Ezekiel at you. You resolve to
proof read your next lab report for
grammatical errors.
Aquarius
This week you are a genetically
altered monkey in the Biochemistry
department. Your feared master looks
agitated that no one from estates has
arrived to fix the lock on the lab door.
That night you break out and start the
zombie apocalypse.
Pisces
This week you are the prime minister
of Greece. You realise that this sort of
job doesn’t come around very often and
decide to publicly shaft Angela Mer-
kel and Nicolas Sarkozy. You retire to
Palmers Green and set up a falafel shop.
