Stephen Gallagher
Hurling
For Imperial’s first match there couldn’t
have been much of a better way to start
the Hurling season. With blue skies and
a light breeze in Greenford the boys in
blue new they were in for something
good.
Despite Oxford not getting a team, there
was a good showing from St Mary’s,
Cambridge and Lakenheath , who
are made up of US Air Force pilots (I
know!).
It was decided that St Mary’s and
ourselves should play as a joint team,
which is what we are doing for Champi-
onships, against a mixed team of Cam-
bridge and Lakenheath in a 60 minute,
13-aside match.
The match began with a shaky start for
both sides as the players got to know the
teammates in their joint team. Once the
ball got rolling it became clear that the
London side were the dominant force.
With some spectacular defending by
Neil Clancy and Paul McGovern, Cam-
bridge found it hard to get near the All-
Star Hurler Stevie Gallagher, who was
stuck in goals through injury but man-
aged some great saves. When the ball
did go wide Stevie’s poc-outs where
literally hit or miss, due to “the wind”.
In mid-field Jack McCaughan and Keith
made impressive runs and scored some
points from distance. Despite not being
able to run at all, St. Mary’s fresher and
U-21 Tyrone footballer Ryan poached
like a pro and kicked as many points
and goals as he pucked. He racked up
an impressive score line.
Cambridge showed some promise at
the start of the second half with two
goals and a point, but London got back
in gear and started to dominate again.
They were boosted by the presence of
Donal McCann, St Mary’s Captain; put
a few great shots over the bar. With the
London forwards seeing the majority
of the ball Jerome Scullion, clearly a
bit rusty after his 5 years in Borstal for
stealing dusties, and John McGuckin
created a few penalties and 65’s, which
were converted.
Sean Dunne in centre half forward
made some good catches, but showed
he was a footballer when it came to
hitting the ball. His frustration was un-
leashed on an unsuspecting American
when he was fouled. London continued
to dominate until the final whistle.
With a few pints in the bar, Imperial
and the Mary’s lads agreed that the test
drive of the amalgamated team had been
successful, looking forward to next Sat-
urday when we hope to bring it to the
Northern and Scottish Universities who
don’t know what’s coming!

Indy Leclercq
Sports Editor
This is it, then. The big one The one
you’ve all been waiting for. I don’t
know about the rest of the Felix
team, but I hope you have as much
fun reading this one as us editors
down here have had doing it.
I also hope you enjoyed the back
cover, which was the fruit of quite a
bit of trawling through the archives,
looking for nuggets of sport through
all the years Felix has been active.
It turns out that the place of sport
in this newspaper has ebbed and
flowed over the years, with some
editors giving it plenty of space, nice
graphics and decent pictures. Other
times, it’s hastily collated in at the
bottom of a page, with about three
results and 50-word reports. For the
first fifteen or so years of existence,
Felix even had a late news supple-
ment, which was basically a couple
of typewritten pages sent out on
friday afternoon - it’s a shame that
doesn’t exist any more, it would be a
godsend for getting results in.
Since the beginning, though,
we’ve not been renowed as a sport-
ing uni (although that is starting to
change), and browsing the archives
makes you realise how little has
changed through the years: Imperial
students are unmistakebly Imperial
students, whether its 1959 or 2009
(as you can see in this week’s Hang-
man, we still have the same sense
of humour. The sportspeople tend
to remain the same, too. There are
always the Rugby and Hockey lot, up
for a laugh; Rowing, who have been
getting up at obscene hours to train
since time immemorial and then
successes in minor sports (Badmin-
ton, Basketball, Fencing and - yes -
Tiddlywinks).
Actually that sport headline from
the 70s struck me when I saw it
(and is now on the back page). I’m
not sure if the editor of the day was
taking the piss, or if he really regard-
ed Tiddlywinks as something that
enough Imperialites were interested
in to print the report. In the pre-
WOW and Starcraft days, I guess it
must have been. What would people
have done to occupy the studying
spaces otherwise? You can network
a few library tables and have a mas-
sively multiplayer Tiddlywinks game,
I suppose.
Unfunny attempts at humour
aside, though, there has alwways
been a tradition of sport at our be-
loved university (-sorry, I’ll stop now)
and Felix has always been there to
report on our glowing triumphs and
soul-crushing defeats. Thanks to
all of you who send your reports in,
the section is really hitting its stride
now.
On another note, I hope to have
the Captains interviews running on
a more regular basis from now on,
so if you’re in a club and interested
in getting your Captain or President
in these pages, drop me an email!
Coming soon: Rugby, Rowing and
Synchronised Swimming. Cheers!
