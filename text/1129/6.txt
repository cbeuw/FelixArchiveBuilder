Resignation Explanation II
Dear Felix,
I am writing this lettet to explain my
decision not to stand for the post of
Deputy President (Clubs & Societies) of
Imperial College Union. I believe that
withdrawing my candidature is in both
my and the Union's best interests
because of the unforeseen complica-
tions which have arisen due to the time
of year at which these elections arc
being held.
By the time the elections are held I
will have completed virtually a whole
term of my third year. In my local edu-
cation authorities opinion I would there-
fore not require funding for this 1st term
again and they arc thus only prepared to
give me any funding for the second and
third terms of my third year. This would
require me (should I have won the elec-
tion) to return to my studies after Christ-
mas next year. I would also get no grant
for the 1st term meaning that I would not
be able to afford to live in London dur-
ing the first term. This would be very
damaging to my studies and accommo-
dation plans for next year.
I appreciate the significant efforts
that the Union has made in trying to
remedy this situation but, as there is no
guarantee that a solution will be found,
I feel that now is the best time for me to
withdraw from the election. I apologise
for any inconvenience that my with-
drawal will cause the Union but I think
that continuing to stand in an election
when I am unsure of whether or not I will
be able to take up the post would be far
more damaging to the Union in the long
term.
I am still interested in this position
and I am looking very seriously at stand-
ing for it again in the February elections
(for next year) when the funding com-
plications will not be relevant. I would
also like to take this opportunity to wish
Marie every luck with her campaign as I
believe her to be an excellent candidate
for what I am certain will prove to be a
challenging position.
Yours Sincerely,
Tim Trailor
"Rugga-buggars"
Dear Felix,
I was in the Union last night [I.e. Wednes-
day 25 November - Ed], in dB's for the
Lovetrain/Shaft spectacular. As usual,
there were al! the "Rugga-buggars" and
what can only be described as hockey-
buggers there in their shirts and ties.
I don't know what time they all arrive
after their match/dinner/whatever, but by
the time the band had finished they
were thoroughly tanked-up. I was mind-
ing my own business when two of these
I'm in a tie I own the building' chaps
barged past me consecutively. I turned
and was like-what arc you doing? Being
ignored is not my favourite past-time, and
when I was, I stuck my fingers up in
protest. Unfortunately the second bloke
saw, and grabbed mc by the neck, push-
ing me through a group of people and
nearly to the ground. Fie was shouting
something to the effect of "I'm bigger
than you so when you complain about
me being a wanker, I have the right to
physically assault you."
Yes, how true he is (satire), I'm glad
I share a science/technology/mcdicine
college with these sporty people.
My point is. Why? Why do you do it,
sports freaks? Just calm down, loose the
grrrr-blokeyness and people will enjoy
their union nights more.
Cheers,
Physics Man
Environmental Lectures
Dear Felix,
For some time there has been talk of
introducing new lecture courses into
undergraduate degrees with an envi-
ronmental bias. In order to be up to date
with other European (particularly Spanish)
universities, the Environmental Society is
proposing that lecture courses tailored to
each discipline should be introduced as
3rd & 4th year options. The resources to
set up a humanities option which covers
renewable energy and sustainable agri-
culture already exist but we arc con-
cerned that the depth of focus that
students may need to enter into a par-
ticular area (such as rcnewables) could
not be achieved teaching a broad scale
course, whereas it could within each sci-
entific field.
We will be holding an open half day
session next term to which we are invit-
ing academics who research and teach
in these areas. We also hope that course
administrators will be able to attend so
that we can begin the process of design-
ing suitable courses.
We will be putting supporters lists on
lecture theatre doors and in common
areas which we would ask anyone to sign
who maybe interested in these courses
so that we can have an idea of their
potential following. Signing would not
commit people to be involved but would
help us to rally support.
Anyone interested to learn more can
contact me, alternatively we meet on
Mondays at 6.00pm in Physics Lecture
Theatre 2.

Back Off, Baker!
Dear Felix
I could go on forever about Simon
Baker's attitude towards Third World Debt
but I can't be bothered. A few points just
have to be made though.
Simon challenged Jacob's statistics
(from Unicef) with World Bank statistics
(which arc notoriously unreliable). Asking
the World Bank its position on the situa-
tions it is creating is rather like asking
Saddam Hussein if he's nice. I'm not say-
ing that the statistics are wrong, but chal-
lenging his apparent assumption that
they are right.
The point that Simon makes about
South Africa's education system being
worse than Ethiopia's yet its economy
being so much bigger just made me
piss myself. The majority of the South
African poulation have been denied basic
human rights until very recently, and the
process of reform is very slow. One of
these human rights was education. South
Africa is an extreme case, not an exam-
ple of a global trend. The fact he uses this
statistic shows how he is trying to under-
mine and be destructive for the sake of
it. I wouldn't care so much if he wasn't
playing with 800 000 000 lives (number
of people declared starving at Rio Sum-
mit, now considered a gross underesti-
mate).
The last point I'm going to pick up on
was actually quite a reasonable one.
Does relieving a country of debt releif
when its controlled by a military junta
mean that you arc incresing the chances
of violence? Firstly let me remind
Mr.Baker that Pinochet was put into
power by the Chicago boys to reform the
Chilean economy, the Abacha junta is
propped up by western Multinationals
(80% of its economic turnover is from oil)
and British and American companies
(GEO Marconi, BAe etc..) provided the
arms, these countries were both totally
undemocratic (Nigeria still is) and the
route to democracy in a country may
not be to squeeze its people so hard that
they can't defend themselves against
infections like Suharto, Abacha and
Pinochet (the tools of the west), but to
allow its people water, healthcare, edu-
cation and freedom of speech so that jus-
tice may follow.
Yours
