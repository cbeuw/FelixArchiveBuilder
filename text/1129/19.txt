N
ow come to the end of its run,
Wyn Jones' epic production of
Mephisto nonetheless deserves
mention. Based on Arlane Mnouchklne's
dramatisation of Klaus Mann's 1936
novel, the play centres on a group of
actots in a small Hamburg theatre at the
time of the Nazis' rise to power in Ger-
many.
The central
character is
Hendrik Hof-
gen, an ambi-
tious radical
actor in the
Peppermill
Cabaret. Hof-
gen is repulsed
by Nazi sympa-
thisers within
his company
and many of
the early
scenes feature
tirades against
National Socialism following the failure
of the Munich Putsch. Yet alongside his
socialist ideology is a violent and
masochistic affair with his black mistress
and marriage to a bisexual actress, which
produces a beguiling mix, convincingly
portrayed by ferdy Roberts. Above all it
is his burning ambition which sees Hof-
gen lured away from the mediocrity of
the Hamburg theatre by the chance of
fame in Berlin.
Though lack of subtlety and imagi-
nation ingrains much of the first half of
this work, it is the final scenes that mar-
vel. With the failure of the ineffectual
Weimar Republic and Hitler now in
power, the Peppermill Cabaret is taken
over by the Nazis. The director is sacked
because his wife is Jewish and they sub-
sequently throw themselves under a
train. Other Jews escape from the the-
atre, some disappear.
Meanwhile, Hofgcn achieves great
success in
Berlin but the
irony is not
lost when it is
the role of
taust that
makes Hof-
gen a star, as
the cattle
trucks roll
towards the
concentration
camps and his
former col-
leagues face
exile or death.
There are
strong performances all round, espe-
cially by Finn Caldwell and Gemma Saun-
ders. Sarah Blenkinsop's clever design
allows the action to swing from Hamburg
to Berlin without losing integrity. The
effect is thrilling yet we arc left with
more questions than answers. Why con-
sidering his background does Hofgen
never examine his conscience? The play
is dedicated to the few German writers
and actors who spoke out against
Nazism. A roll-call of torture, murder and
suicide.

N
othing unusual about this play,
it's in a theatre. However this is
a 19th century operating theatre
and Herb Garret. Instead of patiently
retiring in a comfortable scat awaiting
first night nerves to settle, the setting of
a working museum provided a great
venue. The museum and theatre are sit-
uated in the roof
space of St Thomas's
Church and with
exposed beams, the
apothecary resembles
a barn - a long forgot-
ten sight in the centre
of London.
The crux of the
evening was the play
DeathWatch by Jean
Genet, a psychodrama
of three prisoners
caught in a complex
situation. It is some-
what difficult to tran-
scribe the convoluted
story, but in essence
one inmate is incarcerated for murder;
another has a girlfriend outside, is illit-
erate and is becoming paranoid that
another prisoner - who writes his letters
- fancies her. Essentially there is contin-
ual change in territory and power
throughout the piece, which grips the
viewer in anticipation of the next devel-
opment. There is an admission of guilt
between inmates and as we see events
unfold, the prisoners vie to kill one char-
acter's girlfriend before turning on each
other. I lomosexuality, apparent from the
first scene, seems to underpin the pris-
oners' relationship.
the acting was clean, sharp and well
executed; however with only four actors
and no props, overall it was a little diffi-
cult to suspended disbelief, although
after a time I became fairly absorbed.
Actually performing in an operating the-
atre gave the impression of clinical cold-
ness, just like in a
prison cell. The plot
certainly covered
many topical issues
and some of life's
subtleties, but
approached homo-
phobia and violence,
for instance, in a
novel way,
Since the writer
Genet led such a trau-
matic life (he was con-
victed of theft on
several occasions),
this play touches on
rather personal ques-
tions. In addition to
the literary side of happenings at the Old
Operating Theatre, don't forget that the
audience gets a chance to view the
museum as well and certainly both are
worth seeing.

DRAMSOC THEATRE PREVIEW: MACBETH

Y
ou're young, fast, ambitious. You
get what you want one way or
another. Only this
time you want to be
King. What will you sac-
rifice? Who will you sac-
rifice? And just how far
will you go?
Such is the hype,
surrounding the forth-
coming Dramsoc pro-
duction. With only a few days left before
the run of the infamous "Scottish play"
(I will forgo any comments on supersti-
tion!), I hunted down the acting director
of the IC dramatic society in the Union
labyrinth for an exclusive pre-perfor-
mance low-down.
Although previously involved in
behind the scenes technical work, this is
Simon Myatt's first forage into the realm
of directing, the project has been in
working progress for a year; the play

with rehearsals started in mid-October.
lie admits to never hav-
ing fully grasped the gist
of the piece, when he
studied it at school - all
the more incentive to
tackle Macbeth now.
Although the adap-
tation remains faithful to
the original text, the
occasional adjustment was inevitable
since the play is set in modern times. The
action has been trans-
ported to a City environ-
ment in an attempt to
present the classic in a
more familiar context. The
accent has shifted from
medieval mysticism, per-
haps more intimidating to a Jacobean
audience, to the contemporary themes
of power, desire and greed (hopefully

forgotten the
taste of fears."
promoting the play's accessibility to indi
viduals unversed in the Bard, withou
alienating theatre regu-
lars). Macbeth is por-
trayed as a high-flying
financial executive,
whose quest for authority
is ultimately his downfall,
whereas the witches (of
toil and trouble, cauldron
bubble fame) are trans-
formed into dark, shadowy figures (in X-
Filesque spirit), who lurk in the
background but pull the
slings of the company.
Simon Myatt's aim
was to create a stylish,
minimalist and atmos-
pheric interpretation of
Shakespeare's tragedy.
The cast of twenty or so members con-
sists mainly of freshers. Despite a few ini-
tial hiccups with e-mail systems, he

focussed and dedicated.
Traditional swords

and shelved, exchanged
instead for guns and
blanks. As the tension
spirals, he promises an
exciting twist at the
finale - in fact, the play
stops before the end...
Apparently there's suspense galore, so
watch this space for the definitive review.
