Popular Science and
Unpopular Scientists
The Science of Jurassic Park and thc
Lost World or, How to Build a Dinosaur
by Rob de Salle and David Lindley
194pp Flamingo 1998 £8.99
A
ll serious scientists should have a
go at reading popular science. In
thc quiet bits between experi-
ments, perhaps. And do consider how
science appears in popular culture. It
will, after all, be in your interests to under-
stand it, as your career may depend on
your ability to influence it. You'll learn lots
of interesting things. Like how difficult it
is to explain the simple ideas it has taken
you three or more years to grasp. It'll also
show you the things the public do know
about, and you may be surprised to find
that they arc not as ignorant as you
might have thought or perhaps hoped.
Pay some attention to the stereotypes of
scientists and how these might be per-
petuated. If you land up writing popular
science we'll be looking to you as out
unofficial PR exec. But what has this to
do with this book review?
It seems inconceivable but these
two authors have pulled off a major
achievement. They've written a popular
account of molecular biology. How often
do you see'popular' an
thc same sentence? they spotted the
huge success of 'Jutassic Park' and its
sequel 'The Lost World' and set about
linking the fictional science with the facts.
Could it really happen? They are in a
excellent position to act as guides. Lind-
ley is a science writer and former physi-
cist, and De Salle was responsible, in
1992, for isolating the then oldest known
fragment of DNA.
They write bright, lively and read-
able prose. Actually we can't build a
dinosaut from the dinosaur blood con-
tained within a fossil mosquito, but it was
fun finding out exactly why not. Their
style is distinctly Amctican but it's acces-
sible and thc occasional ghastly Ameri-
canism doesn't get in the way too much.
What DNA docs and whether any bits
from 80 million years ago are preserved
is described entertainingly, and the
unlikelihood that (a) a mosquito pre-
served inside amber has eaten dinosaur
blood and (b) this could be extracted is
explored. Laboratory work, so rarely
described, puts in a welcome appear-
ance. The authors even turn up a sort of
'hippie-drop-out-Nobel-prize-winner' who
invented the Polymerase Chain Reac-
tion, a method for amplifying gene
sequences, and used his prize to go
surfing and become a peripatetic scien-
tific consultant.

entists have climbed so far into their
Ivory Tower that in 1998 they tefer unself-
consciously to people with Down's Syn-

with a life span of about thirty years. I he
latter is simply incorrect and the former...
well - if you don't recognise thc problem
you too need to get out more
Less importantly, the scientists also
have an intermittent
problem with the will-
ing suspension of
their disbelief. It lum-
bers up and down
like the Grand Old
Duke of York and his
men. They arc occa-
sionally distracted by
their own attention to
detail. Sadly this
shades into nerdiness
on a grand scale. For
example, one of the
authors ran his video
of 'Jurassic Park' on
slow motion (anorak on, I guess) and he
was able to jot down the supposed
dinosaut DNA sequence displayed on a
screen in thc dinosaur park visitor centre.
I le trawled through a gene databank on
thc Internet and within half an hout had
found it was from an E. coll bacterium.
The film crew seem to have been quite
inventive in creating the appearance of

authenticity. We could do without the sci-
entist's 'I know I know please please
please' like the school swot. This hap-
pens again when another strand of DNA
is decoded in the film 'The Lost World'
and thc authors recognise an amino acid
sequence which spells MARk WAS HLRE
NIH. An amusing anecdote but a bit too
clever in this context. No one likes a
smart arse.
The film, which
grasped some of thc
style of science with
little of thc content,
did itself trot out
some popular con-
ceptions of scientists.
But this was a story,
made to entertain
and wc shouldn't get
po-faced about mis-
guided scientist
Dickie Attenborough,
gorgeous hunk sci-
entist Sam Neill and
silly screaming scientist Laura Dern led
into interfering with nature and getting
their come uppance. We should worry
when scientists don't appear at all. That's
when we'll know we've really lost the plot
and become totally unpopular scientists.
