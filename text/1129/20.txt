Couldn't find any Dodgy pictures
so here's a dodgy one Instead
Y
ou can't breathe, your throat's
sore, you've started using tis-
sues for their intended purpose
and you're getting to know the uni-
formed girl behind the Boots' counter
very well. Oh yes, that winter cold is
here. What we need, I hear you cry, is
the sound of summer. A jingly-jangly
happy-to-bc-alive feeling that will clear
the congested conduits of our souls.
Well hooray then, because here come
Dodgy!
Formed in Hounslow ten years ago,
Dodgy originally comprised of just vocal-
ist Nigel Clark and drummer and 'pro-
fessional ligger' Matthew priest. Guitarist
Andy Miller joined a couple of years
later. They released a few singles on
independent labels before signing to
A&M in 1993. Mercifully, only one single
from these early days is included here,
the album closer The Elephant, display-
ing that Dodgy were yet to find their
sound. The next 4 years gave us three
Dodgy albums, the lazily titled The Dodgy
Album, followed by the better known
Homegrown and the platinum success
of Free Peace Sweet. We are treated to
twelve 'Ace A's' from these albums plus
their last single before Nigel Clark
jumped ship, Every Single Day. This
leaves us with three 'Killer B's' that are
so lifeless they are incapable of throwing
a punch let alone killing.
So, let's have a look at the singles
then. Aside from the glorious sunshine
pop of 1994's Staying Out I or Ihe Sum-
mer, . it is the songs from Free Peace
Sweer that are engraved into the nation's
consciousness, most notably that staple
of commercial radio Good Enough.
Undeniably catchy at the time (but now
more than a little annoying) it was this
song that catapulted Dodgy to stardom
and Andy Miller into Dcnisc Van Outen's
bed. Gone were the brown-haired hip-
pies, here were the new clean-cut
blondlcs with their poolside efferves-
cence and cheeky chappy drummer.
This compilation was released two
months ago and did little in the way of
selling. It just went to prove that Dodgy
have neither a very loyal nor extensive
fanbase, changing as often as their hair-
cuts. Ihe highlights on this album arc
undoubtedly the songs from Free Peace
Sweet such as If You're Thinking Of Me
and In A Room, so anyone with an inter-
est in Dodgy would be better off getting
that album rather than this one. d

any of you may be unaware
of Cuba (that's the band and
not the place - although it is
possible that some of you may not have
heard of cither), and you shouldn't be
shocked if you are in the former group
of people. Cuba are relatively recent to
the music scene and their choice of
venue tonight is an ideal one, close to
their roots. If you had been listening to
any good radio stations over summer
you probably would have heard a track
by Cuba and I was lucky enough to tune
into Crash I M in Liverpool, so I man-
aged to hear plenty of new alternative
stuff and what a surprise, there is actu-
ally loads of alternative music out there
which you don't get to experience
when you're constantly tuned into
Radio 1! The track they released over
summer was instantly catchy, with a
chorus that calls out to the masses,
'Only together are we unstoppable',
which is chanted over the drilled out
bassline and pounding drums.
Walking up to the Mass (formerly
the Brix), a church with a huge Mass
logo looms in front of you and as you
walk up the spiral staircase to the stage
area the neon lighting tube running
along the railing changes colour,
chameleon like, as though the mere
movement of your steps is fuelling it.
The music playing before Cuba
come on is excellent with a more chilled
out hip hop version of ADF's Culture
Move the definite winner. Cuba are
made up of two guitarists, bassist, drum-
mer and geezer on samplers, with an
occasional singer and brass section. They
begin with an instrumental attack, blast-
ing the audience with a wall of guitar
sonic thrashing aided by the pounding
drums and the bloke controlling the
beats.
The horn section arrive (three blokes
with trumpets) and lift to greater heights
their classic Only Together and new sin-
gle Havana (obvious link to the band
name here, except for those of you who
haven't heard of Cuba of course). Cuba
only play about six songs and some-
times you start to fidget when a song is
stuck on repeat for near eternity, how-
ever this does not lessen the power of
the tracks, with Primal Scream certainly a
definite fave of theirs in the past.
Half of the tracks they play have a
clear live mood to them while the others
sound as if they ought to be played to a
club full of people shuffling to the sub-
tle 'baggy' flavour of Cuba. Have a
Havana on me lads! H
