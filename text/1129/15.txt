Digital Media World 1998
| | |
This year Digital Media World showcased
thc hardware and software powering
computer generated images and multi-
media show reels for the entertainment
industry. This year's top films have all
used some sort of computer
trickery - from removing the
odd stunt wire to recreating
Godzilla and to fantasy worlds
in 'Antz'. The software houses
behind 3D Studio Max, Soft-
image 3D and Maya, were all
present showing off their
capabilities with impressive
show-and-tell classes.
Kinetix, the makers of 3D
Studio Max, have a strong
hold in the computet games
industry and titles such as
Blade Runner (Westwood Stu-
dios) and Tomb Raider II (Eidos) have
shown the potential of this 3D tendering
package. This year's main demonstra-
tion was 3D Studio Max's integration of
Discreet Logic's Paint & Effect software.
The main problem with creating realistic
mm mm
3D images is with the textute that
embodies the bare mesh. Creating a 2D
bitmap that wraps around a solid object
with the colours and shadings in the
right place is a time consuming task.
Discteet Logic's software, how-
ever, allows colour editing to be
done directly onto the 3D
objects. Shaded areas are also re-
editable since all drawing is done
using vector graphics.
Softimage is thc work-
horse of many film and
effects companies, and its
history dates back further
than kinetix's 3D Studio.
Its ability to create realistic
raytraced images is due
to Softimage's industry
leading mental ray Ten-
derer and so has been used time
and time again in films such as
Lost In Space, Titanlic and Antz.
The cost of these animation
packages would give most people
a heart attack (roughly twice the
average grant) but MetaCreations Bryce
3D at atound [200 has allowed it to
gather a cult following among home
users. Its main success must be due to
its own intuitive interface, where realis-
tic icons really do what they represent. It's
gentle learning curve will have you cre-
ating beautifully 3D animated pictures in
minutes rather than hours, when com-
pared with other packages.

Since many of you are looking for jobs
this year here are some tips for finding
a job in thc computer graphics sector.
Most of the students here won't
have had any formal ttaining but it is
important for engineering and science
students to have a good show reel of
demos and projects you have created.
Know your software packages, use
the back of thc popular games maga-
zines to gauge what skills you need.
Edge magazine is a good place to
start and you will notice that knowl-
edge of either 3D Studio or Soft-
image is important. If you haven't
got access to any of the top soft-
ware titles try finding a job as a run-
ner at a film/effect company, and
then try to obtain some after hour
training.
Some major games compa-
nies do have graduate recruitment
schemes and since many of you
will have programmed in C and
C++ your foot is already in the door.

Wargasm (PC) News
Infogrames
Hey wow man, like let's not fight any real
wars but just like fight on the computers
and not spill blood and kill like fellow
man. But what would the world be like
then. Countries would fight over silicon
generated fields, with polygon people
contesting the control of other coun-
tries' resources. If this system was not
secure, and don't kid yourself that mili-
tary means intelligence, what's to stop
rogue elements messing around with
the system and exploiting it. Well wel-
come to the world of Wargasm. This is
where you attempt to achieve world
domination by risking nothing but sotc
atms, and ted taw eyes.
DID has succeeding in creating a
virtual battlefield without having to spend
millions on military computers. They
might therefore have cut a few corners,
no Virtual Reality headsets or real size
mockups of tanks and helicopters - but
they have written it to be compatible with
force feedback joysticks.
Tanks skid and slide if you push
them too hard on dusty surfaces. Heli-
copters handle simply (no need to
study a 200 page manual before
breaking the chopper on thc floor).
Even the footslogging infantry move
with a realistic jog. The weapons are
modeled just perfectly. Hitting a tank
while traveling at near full speed might
be difficult but the joy of it - well it
almost made me want to drive thc teal
thing.
So perhaps it sounds a bit like Bat-
tlezone, where you could play both com-
mander and fighting unit during a battle,
especially when you hear of the Multiple
Wargasm mode. So those people who
enjoy shooting enemy tanks controlled
by people thousands of miles away can
do so. But forgetting the gameplay and
ignoring the multiple player options there
is one reason and one huge reason for
those people with good 3D
acceleration catds to buy this ^ ^ ^ B
game, and that is the graphics. PHHH
They are not just good but so -jS

temperate zones. Tanks were j j p *
there to kick up dust and to lay
tracks in the sand and mud.
Incoming, the eyecandy award winner
from the summer, might as well just get
its coat and sulk because Wargasm has
crossed the borders and trampled its
way to the top. The whole game is one
complete visual-fcst. The soundtrack is
similarly well presented. Along with the
screams of gunfire is a classical score to
stir you into action. Schubert rides into
battle at your shoulder, so to speak.
This is the closest thing to total
immersion games without a body suit. It
might not have the detail of model con-
trol that a full tank or helicopter simula-
tion has. It might be infuriatingly difficult
at first, but if Christmas is a bit slow and
the turkey is faking its time going down,
pop on the headphones, fire up the PC
and go take out some silicon slimebags,
you might just leave the machine by
New Year.

Color Gameboys
Yes, millions of people will be waking up
to Xmas morning, with a special spelling
mistake in their stocking. The Gameboy
has been kicking around in various fla-
vors (sorry flavours) and colours, but tili
now its display has always been shades
of black.
So what's new, well thc colour
screen for one. It will play the new
colour games in proper (well almost
proper) colour, as well as playing some
in a weird pseudo-colour. Not all games
arc compatible though NHL '95 refuses
to play, though V-Rally works. A much
sharper screen is also part of thc deal,
along with a neat infra-red port. It's a bit
more bulky than the pocket version, but
that's progress.
DreamCast Preview
While the Dteamcast was appearing in
numbers over the othet side of the
world, a few here were treated to the
next generation of console power. To
claim a chasm inspiring leap in graphics
when compared with other consoles
would be an understatement. Godzilla
generations was impressive as Godzilla
flicked aside buildings and tanks. But will
Sega get the price right in the UK? Will
the PSX 2 do to the DeamCast what thc
PSX did to thc Saturn? We will know by
next Novembet.
