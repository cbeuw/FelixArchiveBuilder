RSM Football
Birkbeck 0-3 RSM
Sport 27
RSM firsts travelled away from the
sanctuary of Harlington for their first
round match in the challenge cup. With
a first choice team at his disposal, Big
Daddy Masefield was expecting the first
win of his reign.
The whistle sounded and they were
off. The first twenty minutes were played
out at a moderate pace. RSM's back line
was never stretched and in attack front-
man Henry Dowell looked odds on to
break this season's duck.
Eventually RSM converted some of
their pressure but not before Birkbeck
were allowed to properly test the RSM
mettal. It was after a scamble in the Bir-
beck that Nigel Milner opened his
account with a neat finish into the cor-
ner of the goal. Unfortunately that was
the only conclusive action of the first half.
At half time all objectives were in
check, although the lead needed stretch-
ing to comfortable proportions. Chances
were still being created and squandered
with painful regularity. The score was
doubled with a text book solo run from
John Williams who skillfully weaved
through the Birkbeck defence and then
shot clinically from an accutc angle to
score.
A sigh of relief was breathed and
more goals were promised but for the
lacklustre RSM finishing. The Birkbeck
keeper needed a travel card to retrieve
the ball when Skip unleashed a power-
ful yet pitifall drive, despite being advised
not to by Ihe rest of the team. When
Doug Spikes replaced an injured Jerome
Colllnet, it took him little more than a
minute to add his name to the score-
sheet.
This is how the match finished. A job
well done and the first scalp of the sea-
son.
X-Country
IC travelled to Trent Park for the fourth
league race of the ULU championships.
Our initial joy at Brunei's absence was
dashed by the presence of blatantly fit
looking runners.
The frantic pace at freezing tem-
peratures and heavy ground forced
"Compulsive Liar" to abort well founded
hopes of winning.
The Bedfordshire Burd blundered in
in third place, with Quite Contrary 13th
ans Slick Vic an appalling 16th. Due to
their unrivalled success the women
walked away with victory.
The mens race turned the formbook
on its head with some frankly shocking
performances. Andy and Benny Boy
blew their attempts to win a race spec-
tacularly and ended up second and third,
while Andrew Beckwith of Kings was let
off the hook to win. Taz managed to
scrape in 8th, while Hcadlcy finally
detached himself from his bike to finish
17th. Daisy boy at last managed a
decent performance for 24th. with
Wannabe 26th. Bartboy led home the
seconds in 31st, with the Kraut in 39th.
The frankly apalllng performances of
Mike 35th and Compulsive Liar 42nd
dented what would have otherwise been
a good set of results.
The rest of the IC runners trauled in
holding hands because it was cold. Kinky
managed 10 more places than last time.
In reality, of course, IC stormed to victory
in both races obliterating all competition
before returning to the bar where the
ULU committee convened in secret to
decide the BUSA team...
IC Virgins
Royal Holloway0-31 IC
We beat them at home and now we've
beaten them away. I his is the first
match we've played since bonding with
the medics and together we're invinci-
ble. With 5 tries and 3 conversions,
we'd certainly had our Weetabix that
morning (not sponsored by Weetabix
but open to offers).
the first half was tight all the way
though with only one try scored by
Ewok during an attack of awareness by
rampant forwards. Romy was unfirtu-
natcly denied by the ref, the only per-
son on the pitch with the ability to stop
us scoring.
IC finally started putting the domi-
nance they held over the opposition to
advantage in points, Stroming tries
from Betsy (twice), little Clare and Cecil
led to an approximate average of
1.00786 points a minute during the last
quarter.
Our supersub, Ranit, trashed their
midfield defence, with excellent sup-
port from all. I his match was amazing
due to the fact that the only time Hol-
loway made it into our half was at the
kick-off, what a difference to the 79-0
thrashing that we suffered at their hands
last year.
We are looking forward to the BUSA
cup next term. Special thanks to our bril-
liant coach, honaray virgin. Matt "I'm
original seep down really" Cockayne.
Rifle Shooting
BISLEY AFTER BACON
After Turkish Delight, steamy windows
and bacon sandwiches the valiant rifle
shooters set off to Bisley. Arrival al the
vertically challenged Siberian range was
marked by appropriate freezing tem-
paratures and heavy,rain. Ihe shooting
over 100 and 200 yards was impressive
with mosl of the rounds hitting the tar-
gets.
I uneh was notable lor the only spell
of sunny weather during the day and the
copious amounts of fish and chips con-
sumed. As always fellow shooters from
other clubs gathered to admire, cheer
and congratulate us on our fine
weapons and technique.
Drenched, dripping and delirious
we were taken on a grand tour of the
fine town of Bracknell on the return
journey. We discovered the front seal
crews' passion lor woollen headgear.
Congratulations to Guy Dewhurst
for achieving the highest score over 200
yards. Thanks to Andrew Lldridgc for his
coaching, Lee "Petrol Cap" Clements for
the butt marking, Phil "Nose Job" Golds
for his interesting firing technique of the
Magnum, Barry "The Hulk" Ldmond-
stone for demonstating his pick up tech-
nique and Jon McCartney for figuring out
which bullets fit in which hole.
