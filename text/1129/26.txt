"/ was just thinking ... that here
we are, all of us, eating and drinking,
to preserve our previous existence, and
there's nothing, nothing, absolutely no
reason for existing" - the thoughts of
Jean-Paul Sartre as he ate and drank ...
and ate ... and drank.
Man has questioned the meaning
of life throughout his existence. In his
book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the
Galaxy" Douglas Adams' answer is
simple and amusing - the number 42.
However Albert Einstein, who dedicated
much of his life to scientific research,
believed that there was something more:
"religion without science is lame, and
science without religion is blind"
Studying at one of the top
scientific institutes in the U K we may
find his point of view quite alarming -
surely we can just study for a few years,
get a degree and then find ourselves a
good job. Einstein seemed to think that
this is simply not enough: "we should
take care not to make the intellect our
god; it has, of course, powerful
muscles, but no personality" - he
realised that however much we may
work, rest or play, life can still be
incomplete.
Throughout history, people have
claimed to know what this missing
element is and as Christmas approaches
we are reminded of one such man, who
lived two thousand years ago.
'Who do you
say I am?"

He claimed that to make life
complete we need to have a relationship
with God and that this can only be
possible through him. He claimed to be
the Son of God. He claimed that his
death would be payment enough for
everyone's wrong doings. He claimed
that his resurrection from the dead
would break the hold of death on
Mankind. His name was Jesus.
In response to such outrageous
claims, C S Lewis concluded that Jesus
could only be one of three things - a
liar, a lunatic or else he "...was and is
just what he said". Lewis maintains that
there are no other alternatives - he could
neither be just a good man nor just a
prophet. It seems essential, therefore to
examine these claims in order to
determine whether they are true or false.
One approach is to consider the
motives of Jesus and his followers -
what did they have to gain from making
such statements? The answer is startling
- all of them expected persecution,
torture and ultimately a painful death.
Historical documents show that their
expectations were fulfilled in nearly
every single case.
So what do we do now? Should we
follow C S Lewis' example and
investigate these claims or should we
follow Jean-Paul Sartre's lead and just
ponder ... and eat... and drink our lives
away?
Your call...
