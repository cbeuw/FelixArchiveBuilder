IC RADIO
This week we profllejohn Cs lunchtime show. Record Ross Mckenzie's
lunchtime show today (Monday) from 12 -1 for next week's feature.
What do you do at IC Radio?
I am station manager and do a show every luesday lunchtime.
What Is your favourite show?
Ross's show on Mondays and I ridays, and I used to love Jon and Ali's vinyl fron-
tier so I pinched the name for a feature on my show.
What radio DJ do you respect the most/like the most?
I respect John Peel and Jonnie Walker and I loved Mark and Lard when they were
on the graveyard slot.
Would you do a XFm and sell out musically in exchange for popularity?
I admire people like John Peel and Jonnic Walker who didn't have to sell out to
get on Radio 1. I couldn't play music I didn't love without slagging it off so I
doubt it would last long.
What Is your favourite track of the year so far?
Seafood's 'Porchlight'.
What up and coming bands do you recommend checking out?
Lor me the best new bands I've seen this year arc Seafood and HooverDam.
What is your favourite London venue?
I have happy memories of the Monarch in Camden and the Blue Note is fan-
tastic too.
Pub?
It used to be finch's on the Fulham road, but now I'd have to go for the Spread
Eagle in Camden.
Club?
Ihe 'Big kahuna Burger' at the Mars Bar.
Where are you going to be on 31st December 1999?
Out of my tree.
Where would you ideally want to be, and who would you be with?
That's probably not printable even if I wanted to tell you!
Who do you respect the most?
I have immense respect for people who have the courage of their convictions.
One that comes to mind is Howard Marks.
Who do you envy?
People who graduated last year.
What frustrates you the most?
Nappy rash (don't ask!)
If the world were to end tomorrow, what would you do today?
Well it's a bit short notice so it'd probably involve alcohol.
