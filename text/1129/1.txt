Fight Closes Tamil Night
Friday 27 November was an evening of
eastern enlightenment, which
descended into a night of gang war-
fare. Weeks of arduous organisation
and preparation were unceremoniously
upstaged by delinquents searching for
a venue to stage their latest brawl.
As the Tamils' show continued
within the Great Hall, trouble was brew-
ing outside. At approximately midnight
the show's doormen began to argue
with a strangely insistent group of
youths, who wished to gain entry with-
out tickets. Sherfield security became
involved, separating the groups and
seemingly defusing the situation,
unaware of the continuing animosity. A
senior member of security ironically
described thc state of affairs as "a storm
in a teacup". Seconds after the com-
ment thc first floor of the Sherfield
By Andrew Ofori
Building became a battleground as two
groups standing either sides of the
staits clashed and fists flew.
The non-IC groups were described
by some elements of the Union as "mil-
itant" Tamil gangs who had clearly cho-
sen Ihe ICU Tamil night as an
appropriate meeting place The gate-
crashers were spotted earlier on in the
evening, congregating on thc walkway
and many appeared inebriated.
Members of Sherficld security
requested urgent back up and sealed
off the stairs as the brawl ensued on the
first floor, as is "standard practice-
according to security chief Ken Weir. At
some stage during thc night's distur-
bance, a window in one of thc walkway
doors was shattered as one brawler
wildly brandished a bottle.
As the groups withdrew one unfor-
tunate emerged clutching his eye, Shef-
field security led the individual to the
ground floor where he revealed his
bloodied face. Security duly attended
to the wound until an ambulance
arrived. Mr. Weir was keen to empha-
sise "We have no control over external
influences" but judged that "the level of
security must have been adequate for
the needs."
As a result of the melee thc show
was ended and the 'after show grind
session' cancelled. The unsuspecting
audience were led away in one direc-
tion and the troublemakers ushered
off in thc other. Ken Weir explained
once the youths realised "they were
on a hiding to nothing" they left peace-
fully.
Security decided to summon thc
Police in order to ensure the rabble
made a tranquil exodus from college
premises. This calm seemed unlikely to
last as cars packed full of people were
parking along Exhibition Road and con-
sorting with the ousted revellers.
Tamil society were anxious to high-
light "the people involved in the inci-
dent were not IC students" and went on
to "thank thc IC security for their help
in dealing with thc matter".

Nicholaou to stand unopposed
One of the two candidates for Deputy
President (Clubs & Societies), Tim
Trailot, has withdrawn from thc cam-
paign. Marie Nicholaou is still standing
for the post, against the ever-present
New Election, and now seems
favourite to win when Impetial stu-
dents go to the polls in thc last week
of term.
In a letter to Eclix and Imperial
College Union, reproduced in full on
page six, Mr Trailor stated his principle
reason for withdrawing as being finan-
cial. Apparently his local education
authority have refused to fund his
degree for the first term of next year,
as he has already completed the
Autumn tetm this year. Even if college
agreed to cancel fees for the Autumn
Term, Mr Trailor would still be unable
to get a grant. Although some Union
sources have said that it is possible the
Union would pay his grant for the
Autumn Term, the resolution of the
problem is by no means certain. Mr
Trailor felt that this situation would be
"very damaging to my studies and
accomodation plans for next year",
and that it was therefore in "both my

and the Union's best interests" that
he stand down.
Marie Nicholaou has expressed
regret over Mr Trailor's decision, and is
now the only Teal' candidate left for
the election. In fact she is thc last can-
didate for the post for this year, as it
has been annouccd that if New Elec-
tion wins this round no more elec-
tions for DP(C&S) will be held this year
(see Manifestoes on page twelve).
Hustings take place this week at
South Kensington and St Mary's. There
will be no hustings at Charing Cross, as
medical union representatives feel that
they are not useful or well attended.
Hustings at South Kensington will take
place today at 6pm in the Union Build-
ing, while at St Mary's they will occur
on Wednesday evening al a similar
time. Voting takes place next Monday
and Tuesday (14 and 15 December) in
all departments, on all campuses, with
the result being announced sometime
Tuesday evening in the Union Building
at South Kensington.
