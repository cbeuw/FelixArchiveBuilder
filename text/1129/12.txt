Next Monday and Tuesday IC goes to the polls once again, to elect a new Deputy President
(Clubs & Societies). But who should you vote for?
Marie Nicholaou New Election
Six months is not a long time. But a lot
can happen. You could meet someone,
get married, put a deposit on a house
and have a kid on the way in that time.
What I want to do for six months is
improve your clubs and societies. With
the recent introduction of medical stu-
dents onto the South kensington cam-
pus, it is more important than ever to
provide for all our students and their
broad range of interests and needs. All
our clubs and societies aim to unite peo-
ple who have something in common -
sport, political views, sexual orientation
for example - and it is imperative to
give these clubs and their members (you
the students) the support they need to
succeed.
It is very easy to lose your way at
Imperial and graduate with a degree
having not been involved in anything
other than studying. What you do while
you are here will set you apart from
other graduates who are chasing your
job. It is one thing to say that you have
a degree
from Imper-
ial College.
It reflects
better on
you when
you can say
that you
have been
part of a
team, that
you have organised an event or have
been involved with a group of people
who share a common interest.
There are many neglected issues
that need to be resolved at the moment,
and six months of work to catch up on.
Health and safety is one of the areas that
must be addressed immediately.
I am currently captain of the Ladies
Football Club and I will be at IC for a few
years to come. I would like to make pos-
itive changes to the way clubs are run
while I am here. Vote for me - I stand
for your interests.
The most successful candidate ever. New
Election, is standing once again. Appar-
ently I'm so scary that people even pull
out at the fear of losing lo mc. Tradi-
tionally I am the candidate that you vote
for if you are not satisfied with the other
candidates and would prefer to go to
another round of voting in the hope
that a better candidate will stand. In this
election though I am taking on a slightly
different form. By voting for me you are
effectively saying that you would prefer
not to have a Deputy President (Clubs
and Societies) at all for the rest of the
year than have this candidate, as there
will be no further elections if I win.
