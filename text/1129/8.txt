Right Angles To Reality
Colds
F
or Hot Chocolate, it started with a
kiss. In my case it started with itchy
eyes and a nasty tickly feeling at the
back of my throat. I had been using the
word processor all morning, and had
spent a good five minutes at lunchtime
choking on a piece of sweetcorn that
had somehow found its way into my
tuna and cucumber sandwich, so that
could account for the symptoms. But by
the time I went for a late afternoon cof-
fee break and found myself unthink-
ingly ordering a cup of tea instead, my
worst fears were confirmed - I had a
cold. Or had I? Maybe it was just a snif-
fle, I reasoned with myself; two parac-
etamol now and a Lemsip before bed
(an early bed mind - bang goes News-
night), and I might just get away with it.
Then again, this could just be the begin-
ning of something worse - Lassa fever
starts with 'flu-like symptoms doesn't it?
But as I hadn't been in contact with any-
one from Tibet for over a fortnight, that
couldn't be thc problem. My brother, a
medical student, had once cheerfully
informed me that in their initial phase
many contagious diseases resemble the
onset of the common cold, and that at
such an early stage it was impossible to
tell whether the patient would go to
bed and wake up feeling fine, or go to
bed and not wake up at all. As I was in
bed semi-delirious with a temperature of
105Â°F at thc time, I found his enthusiasm
for epidemiology less than infectious.
Whatever the case this time, I was
obviously sickening for
something and I had to
know whether I was
going to get over it in a
day ot two or be cruelly
cut down in my prime
by the ague. Initial
investigations were not
encouraging. I had
failed UNCOSTT - the United Nations
Confirmation Of a Sore Throat Test -
which fot the uninitiated, consists of
seeing whether you can sing the har-
mony part to The Beatles' 1964 hit tight
Days A Week all the way through (my
voice gave out on the second round of
"hold me, love me"s), and holding my
head on one side with my tongue
pressed against the back of my mouth
whilst swallowing forcefully, had clearly
demonstrated that a build up of catarrh
in my nasal-aural tract was in full swing.
That put the tin hat on it -1 was officially
poorly.
When I was a child, having a cold
was almost a cause for celebration, espe-

daily if the day in question
was aThursday as you got
to miss Mrs Mettam's weekly assembly
in the gym. Then there was the happy
prospect of mum making you cups of
Ovaltine and btinging the small black
and white telly that your dad bought in
Last Getmany into your room so you
could watch daytime TV as you suffered.
About the
only time that
I got to watch
Rainbow was
when I was
off school
with 'flu -
which
seemed good
at the time
but has
resulted in an
unfortunate
psychoso-
matic condi-
tion, whereby
I get a fever
and a runny nose if I even so much as
hear "up above the streets and houses,
rainbow climbing high, ev'ryonc can see
it smiling over the sky". The same afflic-
tion has left me unable to enjoy Thun-
derbirds, Stingray and The Sullivans
without feeling slightly unwell - I could
sue. Of course, being off sick had its
downside. Apart from the unpleasant-
ness of the cold itself, there are only so
many of those big bottles of Lucozade
that you can drink with-
out throwing up (8 in
my case) and also the
small matter of having
to put on a Bri-nylon
dressing gown and
shuffle off shivering lo
the toilet every five
minutes. Another prob-
lem I encountered as a childhood invalid
was that of sleep. I frequently used to
botch up the timing badly and get my
recommended daily intake of shuteye
during daylight hours (normally during
Pebble Mill at One and Nationwide) so
that when night came I was wide awake,
condemning myself to a long lonely vigil
with only the World Service for com-
pany. Needless to say, by the time Farm-
ing Today came on at 5.30 am I was a
knackered, bloodshot-eyed wreck who
again slept through the day, selling thc
whole sorry cycle off once more.
It was even worse on thc rare occa-
sions that I got sick when my matetnal
grandmothet was staying. She and my
mother differed wildly on
the proper treatment of a
'flu-stricken child. My grandmother
favoured the tuck-'em-up-and-keep-'em-
warm approach and turned my sick bed
into a boiling, heaving mass of scalding
hot water bottles - one on each side, one
on my tummy with yet another for my
feet. Combined with ihe three exlta
eiderdowns
that pinned
me to the
mattress, they
ensured that
my already
overworked
hypothalamus
was pushed to
the limit, and I
ftcqucntly
awoke from
my uneasy
midmorning
slumbers con-
vinced that my
bed had
somehow turned into a paddling pool.
At this point my mother, who was of the
germs-don't-like-the-cold-why-clse-would-
they-send-TB-patients-to-Switzerland
school of thought, would inevitably
come in, take one look at her son with
his scarlet complexion and sopping hair
plastered to his forehead and immedi-
ately start divesting me of my layers of
cladding and by now lukewarm-water
bottles, whilst shaking her head and
muttering under her
breath. I was the
human embodiment of
the Freeze-Thaw
Process. Had Victorian
freak shows still been
around I could really
have made a killing.
About the only thing
the two of them agreed on was that you
should "feed a cold and starve a fever"
and took it upon themselves to "keep my
strength up", with the result that I ended
up eating six meals a day and putting on
about a stone in weight during the
course of my confinement.
That was then and this is now. My
symptoms had grown progressively
worse and I had reluctantly taken to my
bed. Lying huddled up in myBHS 12-log,
shivering feverishly, I was forced to admit
that getting sick as an adult is a very dif-
ferent, and much less pleasurable expe-
rience than it was as a child. There is no
mum to plump up yout pillows and bring
you hot lemon, no dad coming home at

six o'clock and asking how his little sol-
dier is, and above all there is no Joe 90
double bill on IlV. Having left home
over ten years ago, I am quite used to
living alone, and although there is noth-
ing so guaranteed to make you aware of
your solitude as spending a week in
bed and not seeing a soul from one day
to thc next, I could cope with the isola-
tion, but thc dramatic decline in thc
quality of daytime television since my
childhood was something I hadn't bar-
gained for. Admittedly I now have a
deeper understanding of thc problems
transsexuals addicted to prescription
drugs face in trying to gain social accep-
tance in the southern United States, and
have discovered the secret of how to
bake a Victoria sponge lhat just gives to
thc fingertips, but otherwise my period
of enforced viewing was less than edi-
fying. I found myself completely unriv-
eted by Mikey agonising over whether
he should go to uni or take a year out
and work on his uncle's sheep farm,
and was similarly ambivalent towards
the mysterious disappearance of Mrs
McTavish's faithful little Willie. Why is
there never a good National Geographic
documentary about shatks on when you
want one? Lven an implausible 1950s sci-
fi adventure story acted out by men
called Rock wearing tinfoil space suits
would do; anything but the depressing
parade of low-budget talk shows pre-
sented by RADA rejects that currently
seem to be in vogue, fventually I could-
n't stand another
minute of this tabloid
TV and, as I didn't
appear to be getting
any better, I decided
that thc time had come
to dig out my polar
explorer coat and strug-
gle off to the quack's,
for a first opinion.
When I finally got in to see Dr Patel
he examined me for some time, then
with a puzzled look on his face, he
made a few notes and shook his head
before turning back to me. My expres-
sion must have betrayed my anxiety,
because he gave me a reassuring smile.
It was nothing to worry about, he said,
I had contracted something called 'Alice'
which, whilst not being serious, was
unusual. A course of antibiotics and a
few days bed rest, and I would be as
right as rain. I asked Dr Patel what causes
'Alice'. He shook his head. "Nobody
really knows", he said, "but Christopher
Robin went down with it".
