The Romans, Chinese and Egyptians may
all have had a brutal mentality at some
point in their history, but as the three
races in Settlers 3 they positively ooze
cuteness. Assuming thc role of one of
these, the player must conquer the
world. Simple enough? Not quite, since
a major new feature of The Settlers
comes in the form of divine intervention,
with each race being backed by a par-
ticular god desperate to escape
the wrath of The Almighty'.
for those of you who didn't
know, gamcplay is based
around producing a thriving
economy that ultimately will pro-
vide you with the means to com-
plete each level. Starting with
the bare essentials to begin pro-
duction, you must construct var-
ious buildings ranging from
woodcutters' huts to mines,
grain farms to temples and iron smelters
to castles. Screw it up and you may find
your economy grinds to a halt, as your
miners strike for want of food, or you run
out of planks before you have built a
sawmill.
When you are powerful enough it is
time to vanquish the enemy. Some of
you may be disappointed that this does
not involve the cold-blooded slaughter of
their happy-be-going settlers but a rather
more chivalrous approach of tatgeting
their soldiers alone, with room for tea-
breaks if required. Fighting this way is
very cool
Altogether, this is one classic game.
The graphics and animation arc superb,
complementing the charming gameplay
well. The plot is well defined and like the
cartoonesque cutscenes it is well inte-
grated into the game. However, noth-
ing can beat the satisfaction that comes
from watching your community go about
its business. For this aspect of creativity
alone, you should grab a copy of the
game.

Grim I andango is the latest in a long line
of fucasArts adventure games and was
written by Tim 'Day Of The Tentacle'
Schafer himself, so I expected great
things from this game . I certainly was
not disappointed.
LucasArts have tried to modernise
the look of this game. Gone are the flat
2D characters of ptevious games, hello
3D. This has the effect of making the
game look less 'cartoony' and more film
noir. Unfortunately it also makes
thc main character a little tedious
to move around, but this doesn't
really detract from thc gamcplay
too much and you soon get used
to it. You play the part of Manuel
'Manny' Calavera, the grim reaper.
Or rather a grim reaper, sort of a
travel agent in the world of the
dead. Your job is to collect the
newly deceased and try to sell them
travel packages to Ihe afterlife. Ihe
better the soul has lived their
life, the bettet package they can
afford, fowlifes get a walking
stick and a four year walk, while
nuns etc. get a ticket on thc
'number 9' express train, here to
the afterlife in mete minutes. Of
course, you are on commission
so the better the souls you col-
lect, the sooner you can get out
of here and go to the afterlife
yourself.
So why don't you manage to
get any of the good souls when the
reaper in the next office seems to get a
few every week? There is something
fishy going on in the land of the dead
and you are determined to find out what.
So starts a tale of corruption,
intrigue, chrome and horticulture that will
keep you tied to you computer for days.
One criticism I could level is that the
game is rather linear, but luckily the puz-
zles are for the most part logical and well
thought out so that you don't get stuck
in one place for too long.

The person who came up with the graph-
ics is obviously a Tim Burton fan, a very
big Tim Burton fan. In fact if you knew
that he was a big Tim Burton fan it would-
n't surprise you to hear that the hero's
death in battle is actually the start rather
than the end of the game. The hero Sir
Daniel Fortesque was killed by the lead
bad guy, Zarok the wizard, and Gal-
lowmere was turned into a world of
nasty undead creatures and zombified
villagers.
Luckily though
you have a second
chance as Dan has
risen from the dead
- and having lost
some weight (his
internal organs and
flesh mostly), he's fighting fit and ready
to take on Zarok and his undead fol-
lowers. Dan is going to do this in true 3D
platform gaming tradition by slaying min-
ions and occasionally end of level bosses,
solve puzzles, and attempt to stay alive,
well undead anyway, fot long enough to
meet up with the wizard.
So Tim Burton styled lead characters
aside is thc game worth its medieval
salt? Well the sublime graphics are just
perfect. Just play the first level and watch
the little dismembered hands scuttle
across the ground, the lighting effects of
the torches on walls and fences, the ani-
mation when the swords
and throwing daggers are
used in anger. The split
between slaughtering
and puzzle solving has
also been thought out
and the non-linear nature
of the levels allow a level to be returned
to at any time (in fact it is essential go
back to previous levels to complete the
game). Unfortunately this leads to the
one and only gripe (well apart from pop-
up, but hey I can be generous in such a
well detailed game). Once a level has
been cleared it regenerates all of its nas-
ties so that the next time round it is just
as difficult to complete and definitely
not as enjoyable. Aside from this it is a
perfect example of thc 3D platformer - so
sally forth to yonder shoppe and proffer
your monies for said game.
