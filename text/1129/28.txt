Hockey
IC I 2 - 1 ICSM
We came, we saw we didn't have
enough players, we beat the medics.
After going down to an early goal IC
1 sts poured on the pressure, winning
short corner after short comer, but fail-
ing to convert any before half time.
Like the cold clinical highly organised
outfit that we arc, there was no panic,
and the team moved up a gear and took
the game to them the second the sec-
ond half began. With continuous pres-
sure, Woody slipped one expertly into
the goal. The medics came back hard,
but the team held strong.
This was followed by IC getting more
of the ball and yet more short corners.
It was from one of these, with three
minutes to go that the break came
through.
11 -plus pulled the ball to Flashy
W**ker who stepped in and moved it on
to Big I itties. He passed it across goal to
Blue Underpants whose shot was
deflected to the waiting 11 -plus, final
score 2-1.
IC II 1 - 1 ICSM II
A game played in artic conditions,- diplo-
macy went to the wall as hockey's subl-
ties turned into what looked like Rugby.
ICSM scored on a short corner in the first
two minutes gave their side false hopes.
The score did not change after that in
the first half.
After an awe-inspiring half time talk from
our captain, we were ready to do battle.
Polite antics were droped and we started
to make progress. With some swift pass-
ing Carlos found himself with a shot on
goal. He managed to put the ball some-
where near the goal and after ICSM des-
perately fumbled around with
themselves, they pushed the ball over
the line. The game continued to be a
blood bath and the score did not
change.
Ladies Hockey
IC II 0 - 1 ICSM II
After losing to the medics 6-0 in the
BUSA, a lot of our team were afraid to
turnout. However, the 9 of us who did
were on excellent form, and with the
help of medics subs, we only lost 1-0. In
sub zero temperatures but cheerful
atmosphere the IC scientists & engineers
and IC medics battled it out. The unusual
presence of a qualified umpire surprised
some of the players who were used
more freedom, but any attempts at play-
ing football were quickly curtailed.
The medics attacked strongly but IC
defended well, the goal being an
unlucky own goal from the keeper.
Despite more pressure from IC in the
second half we were unable to score (no
change there) and had to concede our
second defeat of the season to ICSM.
Football
IC IV 0 - 4 LSE II
It was almost as if this fixture was never
going to be played. After travelling all
the way to Berrylands on Saturday we
were told that we could not play on as
the pitches were waterlogged. Maybe a
phone call next time LSL?
So at the second time of asking, we
met the 2nds on the second day of
December. Even then we still faced
problems. Aidan "Lloyds" Banks had left
his kit at home, so with the upmost co-
operation (?), Joules suggested we take
our 2nds as this cup game took priorty
over their league game.
Onto the game. Whilst we thrashed
LSE IV's 7-0, LSE 2nds are two divisions
above us, so we were really up against
it. We started strongly, but any founda-
tions we had laid were soon crushed by
an early goal off a quick attack. Adam
"Where's Bianca" Gibson had to be sub-
stituted after 20 mins following a
drunken injury and some good football
by us was matchc dby LSE', who stepped
up their game when they realised we
weren't going to take this match lying
down. The half-time score was 2-0, and
despite captain Elliot "Ihe Boss" New-
some bringing some continental flair to
the game in the form of Fred "Garlic
Bread" Gelloz, soon went to 3-0 follow-
ing a half hearted save by keeper Stu
"stressed out" Cook. Despite some qual-
ity play in the last IB minutes wilh the
addition of Bola "Bola" Bola, LSE capped
off the game with a quality goal. Man
of the mathc must surely go to Davie
"The Irish Navy" Wishart who gave 100%
up until the very end. Ail in all we gave
a performance not to be ashamed of.
IC V 1 - 2 QMW
Typically, the best performance of the
season ended in a negative result for the
team. After harrassing their defenders
the entire first half, some contentious
decisions by the referee, in particular a
"handball" given against Mark Dawkins
in the box led to their penalty being
saved by an oustandingJ.P. Tom Walker
and Will Doubor were excellent in mid-
field, stringing passes together and cre-
ating chances, but they broke away and
scored a scrappy goal against the run of
play. A corner on the stroke of half
time was swung in dangerously and
deflected in but we knew that we had
been playing better than they had
Chiva opted for all out attack in the sec-
ond half to pull the goals back. New
centre-forward Tom Lovell was brought
on for defensive midfielder Adltya Chair
and the three-pronged attack produced
a goal when "dazzling" Fraz juiced past
a defender in the box and smashed the
ball into the roof of the net. Cue a
siege on their goal where chances went
begging and we were brilliant but it just
wasn't our day.
