Pancake
race
1969
Yes, it's almost that time of year again.
On February 27th, it's pancake day; and about time
we went back to the good old College traditions.
FELIX is to restart the pancake race, which, until 1981
was an annual event. But this is no ordinary pancake
race-this will be a three-legged pancake race, with
a fantastic prize! Good for a laugh, but tradition says
you'll get very wet as well.
This will be a good way to obtain a broken leg and
also a way in which election candidates can get free
publicity, so make sure you come along. Everybody
is more than welcome to enter. See next issue for
more details.
Annual
General
Meetings
One tradition that is not going to be lost, is that of
the Unions' Annual General Meetings. The one seen
above carries an advertisement for the 1976 RCS
Annual Dinner. This year RCS have sold 180 tickets
for their Kensington Hilton dinner at £25. City & Guilds
have sold 200 double tickets for their Ball at the
Waldorf Hotel at £75 per pair. The RCS have Terry
Jones and Michael Palin from Monty Python, and both
evenings end with a disco.
Enjoy the Saturday morning hangover!
