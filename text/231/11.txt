f i r s t Thursday of term at twelve o'clock. (A convenient time f o r a quiet
afternoon's d r i n k i n p r e p a r a t i o n f o r the evening).
Five members o f the department however, were f a r more impatient.
By 3p.m. they were i n high s p i r i t s 'walking' along Kensington High S t r e e t ,
amusing the passers by, when along aame a 'bobby' - angling f o r promotion?
- he f e a r l e s s l y stopped the merry group, and marched them o f f t o the P o l i c e
s t a t i o n . At the s t a t i o n they were locked i n s o l i t a r y confinement and char-
ged w i t h 'behaviour l i k e l y t o cause a breach of the peace',
Two hours l a t e r t h i s s e d i t i o u s band were released on Â£2 b a i l each t o
wander, once more, through the peaceful streets of Kensington.
Next day they had t o appear at the Magistrates court t o answer f o r
t h e i r crimes'. One of the persons concerned was a f o r e i g n e r and
although he spoke p e r f e c t E n g l i s h he had a bad stammer. The Magistrate,
confrontated by t h i s s i t u a t i o n , exercised extreme wisdom and adjourned
the hearing f o r a week so that they could obtain an i m t e r p r e t e r .
They have since been .fined one pibund each - Guildsman take heed.
