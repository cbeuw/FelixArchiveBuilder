Science and R e l i g i o n
" T H E R E WAS not now, as
there had been in the day of
Huxley himself, a direct con-
flict between religion and
science." So began Professor
Herman Bondi of Kings Col-'
lege, when he addressed the
Huxley Society on the subject
of Religion and Science. Now-
days religious fundamentalists
are a minority; generally theo-
logy tends to be more interpret-
ive than in the past.
T h e r e is still, however, a C o n -
flict a r i s i n g f r o m t h e different
methods of approach to problems.
M u c h of r e l i g i o n relies o n "revelat-
i o n " w h i c h is n o t open t o speculat-
ive questioning, whereas doubt is
t h e " m e a t " of science. I f experi-
m e n t a l results conflict w i t h the
predictions of a theory, the theory
c a n b e said t o b e disproved, a l -
t h o u g h agreement of theoretical
a n d e m p i r i c a l data does n o t neces-
sarily prove the theory. A good ex-
a m p l e is N e w t o n ' s T h e o r y of
Gravitation w h i c h w a s n o t d i s p r o v -
e d for 2 0 0 years, i n fact, until
technology e n a b l e d measurements
to b e m a d e w h i c h s h o w e d u p itaj
inability t o account accurately f o r
real situations.
T h u s the essence of science is
acceptance of t h e y a r d stick of ex-
p e r i m e n t a l disproof. Since such d i s -
p r o o f must b e universaly accepted
b y definition, science is s p m e t h i n g
o n w h i c h people of m a n y countries
a n d backgrounds c a n agree, w h e r e -
as religious ideas v a r y w i d e l y f r o m
one group t o another. T h i s is b e -
cause religion is one of these pers-
onal areas of life w h e r e decisions,
are influenced b y the social a n d
sexual attributes of the h u m a n
b e i n g , rather than l o g i c a l deduct-
i o n . O b v i o u s l y science does n o t
pretend t o legislate here. I t is f o r
this reason that there c a n b e n o
certainty a n d universal agreement
in such decision^ as those i n v o l v i n g
" t a s t e " o r personal preference.
F o r t u n a t e l y , w e a r e a l l different,
a n d w e c a n a l l , intelligently a n d
sincerely h o l d different opinions
w i t h equal validity.
A r i s i n g from this said the Profes-
sor, i t seemed to h i m to b e b a . ' c -
a l l y w r o n g that religious attitudes
s h o u l d b e i m p o s e d o n people, f o r
example b y teaching one p a r t i c u l a r
religion i n schools. R e l i g i o n s h o u l d
not b e a State responsibility, b u t a
personal one. H i s t o r y shows that
an a d o p t e d state r e l i g i o n u s u a l l y
leads to conflict a n d suffering.
R a t h e r , o n e s h o u l d i n f o r m c h i l d r e n
of t h e fact that there a r e m a n y d i f -
ferent religions, a n d that n o p a r t i c u l -
ar o n e holds t h e u n i v e r s a l a n d e x -
clusive truth b u t everyone is e n -
titled to h i s o w n preference.

With the demand for electricity doubling every eight years, we can offer
some of the most challenging research, both fundamental and applied, to be
tackled in the coming years. Rewarding careers are also offered within the
Computing Branch, where the solution of research, planning and operational
problems necessitate the use of some of the most advanced computer
equipment in the world.
You will find a university-like atmosphere, modem equipment and
opportunities for consultation with universities and research organizations.
Our laboratories are pleasantly situated and have well-established sports
and social clubs.
Excellent salaries and prospects are offered; at 21-22 with a good
honours degree you could earn £1,200 p.a.; for a Ph.D. at 24-25 this might
be £1,600 p.a. Freedom is giveh to publish the results of research and it is
possible to work for higher degrees.
Apart from research, there are opportunities for electrical and mechanical
engineers and physicists to gain two years engineering training leading to
good careers in generation, transmission or design and construction. Posts
and training schemes in administration and personnel management are
available for arts graduates and those of other disciplines.
