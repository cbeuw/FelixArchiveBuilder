The Halls-Fact and Fable
Mike Wilson (Halls Rep. on Council) defends the selection
system against charges of bias
Much criticism has been levelled recent-
ly at the Halls system in I.C. In fact, a
recent editorial in this paper asked
whether wardens should. determine the
moral standards of residents, as this ap-
peared to be the current trend. It compar-
ed Halls to boarding school dormitories,
and it followed several letters in the cor-
respondence columns of the same general
tenor. One also frequently hears the al-
legation that the Halls are closed shops.
How much truth is three in this, and how
bad are the Halls really?

are p r i v i l e g e d , b u t every attempt has been m a d e
to keep this to a m i n i m u m . A s to H a l l b e i n g a

nonsense. 2 5 % of each H a l l ' s residents h a v e t w o
years i n H a l l , 2 5 % are freshers a n d about 5 0 %
a r e people w h o are i n H a l l for t h e first time.
O b v i o u s l y the selection procedure is n o t perfect,
b u t improvements a r e difficult to envisage.
No bias towards the Rugby Club
F e w p e o p l e w o u l d prefer the wardens tilling
their o w n H a l l s w i t h those they consider to b e
"desirable residents". T h e P i n M e t h o d h a s

the departmental m e t h o d is t h e •method current-

criticism.
Allegations, such as t h e current o n e that i f

get into T i z a r d are totally u n f o u n d e d . N o d o u b t
the R u g b y C l u b makes i t s presence felt, b u t
there a r e n o more G u i l d s m e n i n T i z a r d than i n
the C o l l e g e as a w h o l e , a n d furthermore, a higher
percentage of G u i l d s a p p l y to H a l l s t h a n M i n e s

W h a t a r e the chances of getting i n ? A t t h e
m o m e n t there are less, than three applications
for every a v a i l a b l e place. A survey c a r r i e d o u t

2 4 % of the post-grad aates a p p l y .

Powerful Hall Committees
People often underestimate t h e p o w e r a n d
effectiveness of H a l l C o m m i t t e e s ( a n d of the
Union) i n t h e r u n n i n g of the H a l l s . H a l l C o m -
mutes are students elected b y their fellow resid-
ents a n d they have a v e r y b i g say i n h o w a H a l l
is run. A l t h o u g h a W a r d e n is u l t i m a t e l y respons-
i b l e for t h e r u n n i n g of h i s H a l l , a n d has t h e
p o w e r " t o take s u m m a r y a c t i o n " , this rarely, if
ever, happens. T h e regulations are extraordinar-
ily flexible, a n d t h e H a l l Committees help to
keep t h e m so. A m o v e at t h e b e g i n n i n g of this
sefJGion to specify t h e "reasonable h o u r b y w h i c h
guests w i l l n o r m a l l y b e expected t o leave", never
got off t h e ground. Proposals for systems of
punishments such as fines, were squashed b y the
H a l l C o m m i t t e e s , t h e f a m e d Proctors never a p -
p e a r e d because of student o p i n i o n , a n d w h e n

proofs f o r the changes i n t h e regulations m a d e
