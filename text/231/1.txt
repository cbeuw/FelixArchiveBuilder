Most Guilds

for five years
by our Political Correspondent
Next year's constituent college
noted both for their quantity
presidential candidates are
and for their quality. Deputy
president Molam has already
won Mines, Guilds have more
contenders than at any other
time in the last five years and
RCS is gripped with a growing
feeling of seriousness.
D e s p i t e t h e intervention o f out-
side candidate Pete R e e d , w h o has
as y e t n o policies, t h e choice before
RCS this year is very m u c h t h e

Carnival magazine
sells badly
Sales of this years carnival
magazine have not been going
well so far—by Wednesday only!
about 700 copies had been sold.
Sales manager Jane Pearson,
blames lack of sales staff (some
people have refused point blank
to sell the magazine) on grounds'
of uninteresting copy and a high
price brought about by lack of
advertising. Many first-years
particularly, in expectation
of a joke magazine of dubious!
taste, and finding this not to ba
so, seem to be not buying
T A N G E N T .
Anyone w h o w o u l d be prepared
to sell the magazine at the F . A . C u p
F i n a l should contact Jane Pearson
itt 125 N e w Beit or v i a the U n i o n
letter rack.

A. Sc. W. opposes
loans suggestion
W o r t h E 5 0 0 m a y e a r
t o i n d u s t r y
IN T H E latest edition of
their iournal, the Association of
Scientific Workers take a firm
stand against the suggestion of
the Department of Education
and Science that students grants
should be replaced by loans.
In a n interview. M r . H a r r y F a i r -
brother, the secretary of the I . C .
b r a n c h association, said that the
G o v e r n m e n t tended to regard h i g h -
er education as a, social service
w h i c h placed a financial burden o n
the c o m m u n i t y , rather than regard-
i n g it as a n investment for future
benefits. T h e A . S c . W . h a d . h o w -
ever, m o r n ted a survey w h i c h
s h o w e d ti at the benefit to the
country frc:n graduates w h o enter-
ed research departments alone was
of the order of £ 5 0 0 m i l l i o n p e r
y e a r — f a r i n excess of what the
government consider university
education w i l l be worth in the next
few years.
T h e Association objects to loans
p r i m a r i l y lx'cause students w o u l d be
deterred i r o m entering universities
by the prospect of h a v i n g to repay
the money they obtain. Students
entering universities are m a k i n g a
financial sacrifice on what they
c o u l d e a m i n scientific e m p l o y m e n t
on l e a v i n g school. M a n y people
faced w i t h the prospect of repay-
ing university grants w o u l d p r o -
haly prefer to go straight into i n -
dustry from school. In fact the D e -
f
iartment of E d u c a t i o n a n d Science
las been rebuited b y so m a n y con-
cerned parties o n similar grounds,
that a l l present plans have been
shelved, although the department is
still c o m m i t t e d to work w i t h i n t h e
framework of the N a t i o n a l P l a n .
T h e article i n the journal also
points o u t that undergraduates use
their grants to p a y their w a y dur-
ing term-time a n d d u r i n g vacations
are forced into t a k i n g a n y job
w h i c h w i l l b r i n g enough money to
m a k e ends meet. T h e Association
suggests that grants should be a d -
justed to m a k e undergraduates i n -
comes c o m p a r a b l e w i t h those of
others of the same age group i n
f u l l - t i m e e m p l o y m e n t . O n e w a y of
raising more money, the Association
says, w o u l d be i n the form of a tax
on productive enterprises. T h e
article also suggests a review of
grants to postgraduates, m a r r i e d
a n d other students.
