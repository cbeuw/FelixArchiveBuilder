A Visit to Carlisle
Carlisle has followed the normal course
of development of the Redbrick Univers-
ities. Starting as a specialist foundation of
the Methodist Church at the turn of the
century, it later accepted students to read
for the University of London external de-
grees and received its charter from the Privy
Council during the period of rapid univers-
ity expansion just after the war. Smaller
than the institutions we have reviewed in
previous articles of this irregular series,
Carlisle has just under 2,000 students—the
vast majority of them in Halls of resid-
ence.
Contraception and Segregation
A t £5.14.0d. a week .the halls p r o v i d e excel-
lent value w i t h comfortably furnished rooms a n d
w e l l c o o k e d meals. T h e one o l d hall (for M e n )
provides f e w bathrooms or showers a n d most of
the rooms d o not have w a s h basins as it isi a
conversion of the o l d country house i n w h i c h t h e
college was founded. T o a visitor from I . C . . H a l l
discipline seems u n b e l i e v a b l y strict, all visitors
must leave by 10.30 p . m . a n d no resident is a l -
l o w e d to take visitors of the opposite sex u p to
his room. A s C a r l i s l e was one of the first univers-
ities to introduce contraceptive advice into its
health room this shows a surprising lack of
technical k n o w l e d g e on the part of the A u t h o r -
ities.
In the m a n n e r of the o l d country house, the
college b u i l d i n g s are isolated from one another
i n the extensive grounds, some of w h i c h form
the s p l e n d i d p l a y i n g fields. T h e college is self-
contained, a n d students seldom need to leave the
campus. T h i s is p a r t l y d u e to the fine s h o p p i n g
facilities i n the U n i o n . H o w e v e r this develop-
ment of a thriving university life is p r o b a b l y d u e
to the lack of facilities for recreation in the t o w n
of C a r l i s l e . It has an essentially rural atmo-
sphere, i n c o m p l e t e contrast to I . C . T h e relativ-
ely m o d e m U n i o n presents a glassy aspect a n d
is said to be ill-ventilated: it has, fine a l l - r o u n d
facilities, i n c l u d i n g a s u p e r b l y e q u i p p e d concert-

end of the first year.

Tangent Reviewed
It seems that the tradition of choosing
the Notting Hill Gate Housing Trust as the
l.C. Carnival Charity has started a tradit-
ion in Carnival magazines. Tangent, this
year's magazine, is exactly the same as last
year's Etc. in construction and layout.
Unfortunately the amount of copy in
Tangent is very little, making it a bad buy
for Z/6 (or even more). It can be argued
that since it is being sold for charity it does
not matter what the magazine is like. How-
ever, a charity magazine should be able to
sell for its own sake, and this, I feel,
Tangent will not do.
T h e idea of the m a g a z i n e c o n t a i n i n g articles
written b y p r o m i n e n t personalities is basically a
g o o d one, b u t i n T a n g e n t it is taken too far.
O n l y the E d i o t r i a ! a n d t h e C a r n i v a l Organiser's
c o l u m n c a n b e said to b e original, a n d even that
is d u b i o u s (compare w i t h Etc.). E v e n t h e
q u a l i t y of the b o r r o w e d m a t e r i a l is not too h i g h ,
w i t h the notable exception of M i c h a e l F r a y n ' s
piece ( w h i c h I h a p p e n e d to have already read
in the Observer about t w o months ago).
T h e small size of T a n g e n t can easily be ac-
c o u n t e d for b y the lack of advertising c o n t a i n e d
in it. B u t there is no lack of p e o p l e w i s h i n g to
advertise so there must have been a lack of
p e o p l e w i s h i n g to go out a n d get i t .
Surely there must be some original talent in
a C o l l e g e of this size-—oven i f w e are a l l
scientists. T h e great trouble is w a i t i n g for
volunteers. O n e is m u c h more p r e p a r e d to h e l p
if asked personally. T h e C a r n i v a l Organisers
should k n o w of people w i t h ability a n d ask
t h e m for contributions. T h e magazine as it
stands, c o u l d have c o m e from anywhere, a n d
therefore needs s o m e t h i n g apart f r o m the cover
to give it a personality of its o w n .
