A Glance Backwards
I must admit I'm rather proud of
this issue; IC hasn't seen a
twenty-six page FELIX in nearly
four years (the last time was
Colin Palmer's Freshers' issue—
32 pages) and it's a great tribute
to the staff that we've managed
it in an unbelievable three days.
Throughout the year I've
striven to make FELIX as large
as possible. My guiding principle
in producing the newspaper has
been Steve Marshall's dictum
'Aim to produce a newspaper
which you yourself would like to
pick up on Friday mornings,'
and this has meant a marked
increased in size. Happily, the
consequent inevitable sacrifice in
terms of design has not been too
severe, although I have been a
little disappointed that there
hasn't been time to be more
adventurous with graphics and
layout. Pallab intends to reverse
the trend, and so next year you
can expect FELICES which are
smaller but packed with exciting
new ideas on the artistic side.
FELIX has also been rather
laid-back this year, and there has
been little aggressive criticism of
the kind we have been used to.
This has been quite deliberate. It
is clear to me that many College
administrators (Mooney being
the supreme example) refuse to
take F E L I X seriously and
believe that any criticism of their
shortcomings is the result of a
personal and mindless vendetta
on the part of the Editor,
symptomatic of what they see as
the general irresponsible attitude
of today's students. The way to
get out of this rut is, in my
opinion, not by insulting Sher-
field Building, or even by
making continual jokes about it
(although these will have their
place) but byfirstgetting FELIX
accepted as a
> responsible organ
of student opinion and then
making detailed and reasoned
criticism of its failings. This will
not be easy. It cannot be done
quickly. But I believe it is the
only way to get College block
to sit up and take F E L I X
seriously.
My biggest disappointment
this year has been over feature
articles. Looking back through
the archives over the past few
years, nearly every editor, in his
election manifesto and early
issues, has promised bigger and
more regular features; but by the
end of the year they have all
been apologising and saying that
there just hasn't been time.
Perhaps this is one of the facts of
life—that producing FELIX just
doesn't allow the large amount
of time a good feature article

EDITORIAL
There are so many people who have made FELIX what it is
this year that I can't hope to list them all, but ifyou have ever
done anything constructive for me this year, consider
yourself thanked. Those who get special mentions here are
the ones who have taken specific, regular commitments. In
no particular order

different on one girl than he is on another
takes. But I hope and believe this
is not so, and a hardworking
features editor (one of the posts
on this year's staff which has
never been taken) should be able
to do wonders for FELIX.
And so to the news. When I
took the job of Editor I was
warned that it takes about sixty
hours a week—thirty of them on
Thursdays. Producing such large
editions has meant that I have
had to spend all of Wednesday
and Thursday of each weekorgan-
ising, administering and helping,
which has left absolutely no time
left to write the news. Con-
sequently I am grateful beyond
words to Adrian James who
took on the hateful job of news
editor in September and has
done it, efficiently and reliably,
all year—longer, I believe, than
anyone else in the history of
FELIX.
News reporting sounds so
simple in theory. In practice
almost every story has its own
problems attached, mainly
because people hate to see their
names in print. Frequently
people refuse to talk to FELIX
at all (and then complain when
we get the facts slightly wrong);
and if we do get a good story in
full detail, there is certain to be
Uune 16,19831
someone cringing at the office
door whining at me not to print
the story because 'what hap-
pened is all in the past now'.
In view of these problems (and
I know people will disagree with
me on this) I consider the news
to have been one of the strong
points of this year's FELIX.
Pallab has said he can do better:
I hope he can, and I wish him
luck—but I don't believe him.
Next Year
There will only be one post-
graduate FELIX over the sum-
mer and it will appear on August
7. I'm sure Pallab would appre-
ciate any articles for this and
help in producing it, so if you're
around over the summer with
time to kill, come and indulge
your temporicidal instincts in
FELIX.
For the Freshers' F E L I X
Pallab has set the deadline for
clubs and societies articles at
September 7, but is hoping many
of them will be submitted this
term (he'll be lucky!).
CCUs
There is one important aspect of
the Union which merits an end-
of-year comment and, for better
or worse, it's rather negative. In
recent weeks the C C U s in
general and RCSU in particular
have been prominent in the
news.
I often wonder how they can
be so shortsighted as to provoke
a relatively placid Exec when
Christine Teller and Gaynor
Lewis are about to take over.
Can't they see that Christine (in
particular) will be looking for
any excuse to cut back on the
cash ICU gives to the over-
financed CCUs next year, and by
behaving as childishly as they
have recently they are giving htr
just the opportunity she heeds?
Personally, I would support
Christine in her aims, since !
firmly believe the CCUs repre-
sent a minority interest in
College. The CCUs do have a
very strong case, but they aren't
going to advance it much if they
carry on as they have been
recently.
FELIX Car Rally
Sunday morning from 9:30am
till lunchtime. I've only had two
entries so far, you indolent
bunch. There's still time to join
us.
Last Words
I'd like to finish by just thanking
you, the members of IC Union
for paying me throughout what
has been a fabulous year. All I
can say is that if you've enjoyed
my FELICES half as much as I
have, then I've enjoyed them
twice as much as you.
