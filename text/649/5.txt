As the mantle of presidential impartiality slips from his shoulders
GOULDER BLASTS RCSU
In my first few days at Imperial
College the nature of the CCUs
was attacked by the then SCC
Chairman Dr Frank James. In a
series of provocative statements
he labelled them as anti-
intellectual beer swilling louts
participating in essentially tribal
traditions. This view was debated
extensively and was not without
support in the letters column of
FELIX. However, in bracketing
the CCUs together Dr James
made his principal mistake.
Whereas RSMU and C&GU con-
tinue to provide a broadbased
and valuable service to their
members, RCSU has sunk to a
pitiable level. It is not without
some regret that I say this because
I did take part in RCSU activities
over two of my three under-
graduate years and I have now
begun to get involved with the
RCSA.
It is the events of this year that
have confirmed that RCSU has
failed to merit any significant
status within IC. In membership
it has become a rump of self
indulgent, self deluding indivi-
duals who seek to perpetuate a set
of traditions whose origins have
been lost in the mists of 1960s
antiquity. They do little to cater
for the majority of their ordinary
members—can there be any
greater disincentive to attending
a formal dinner than for some-
body to vomit the contents of his
stomach over the table after
making an attempt to finish the
three handled pot? Their much
vaunted academic societies
could be better handled within
ICU, certainly many of the
problems that arose with Bio-
chem Soc would not have arisen
had it been monitored by ICU.
Mascotry has become insti-
tutionalised vandalism in the
hands of RCSU. It has descended
to breaking and entering in its
attempts to obtain mascots. In
its recent actions concerning the
blatant misuse of an ICU van the
officer concerned revealed the
moral corruption that has
become typical of RCSU'mas-
cotry. Can it then come as any
surprise when this ambivalence
to vandalism leads to yet
another year when Silwood Park
staff were left to clear up after
-the May Ball? Professor Way
had no alternative but to end the
Silwood Ball after several years
of warnings had gone unheeded.
In my annual report, discussed
at the ICU A G M , the main
FELIX H n H H
concern of the RCSU contingent
present was not Residence,
Refectory or Academic policy
but their right to throw rotting
fish after Morphy Day. This
illustrates their laughable set of
priorities and their absurd idea
of what really matters in IC.
But perhaps* it is in their
dealings with ICU that RCSU
has demonstrated the depths of
its moral bankruptcy and
internal decay. The way certain
officers of RCSU misled the
U F C over the size of their
deposit account can only be
explained as a deliberate lie. In
order to obtain an ICU van for
mascotry, the incident I men-
tioned previously, an RCSU
officer virtually lied to a member
of permanent staff. I found it
astonishing that the person
involved objected to ICU dis-
ciplining him for this breach of
trust.
There was one event that
could be said to be the apotheo-
sis of what RCSU has become:
their A G M . The initiation rites
were almost aboriginal in their
tribal emphasis. Firstly the
officers were humiliated by
being covered in waste refuse
and then raised to officer status
by the application of 'warpaint'.
There were also the 'traditions'
formulated in modern times
typified by the consumption of
curdled milk and beer. Even
such a ridiculous tradition was
strong enough to prevent any
new officer of RCSU breaking it.
At the end of the meeting they
performed the Kangala which
did not sound like the proud
chant I remember but more like
an obscuie unintelligible nursery
rhyme.
Perhaps it is worth discussing
how RCSU have reached such a
nadir in such a relatively short
time. It may well be that it is
predominantly a question of
style that is involved. Possibly in
previous years there were
officers who had the strength of
character to be able to fulfil a
role that appealed to a broad
cross section . It is very notice-
able that there are virtually no
postgraduates involved in
RCSU, indeed one of RCSU's
complaints to me is that there
will be no person active in RCSU
who will be over 21 next year
and therefore old enough to hire
an ICU van. In the last few years
successive RCSU Presidents
have surrendered the middle
ground and have allowed their
appeal to be to a minority even
among those whom Dr James
would label as 'beer swilling
louts'.
That this has happened to a
body founded in 1891 with T H
Huxley as its first President is a
great tragedy. It retains a status
at Imperial College of which its
actions continue to demonstrate
that it is not worthy. Indeed
within the constitution of ICU,
RCSU as one of the CCUs, has
considerable influence through
the executive that is effectively
denied to other branches of ICU.
Perhaps the time has come for
that influence to be not a right
but a privilege through an
election from Council.
The only remedy that will haul
RCSU out of the abyss is to
make it aware that it will have to
take full and direct responsibility
for its actions. As far as this is in
my power to do I fully intend to
do so. The process has begun
through the cessation of the
Silwood Ball, the punitive action
against Mr Fuller and through a
close scrutiny of the R C S U
estimates. They must not be
judged on their illustrious past
but on what they do now.
In many respects the indivi-
duals now involved in RCSU are
like monkeys scampering over
the ruins of a once great civilisa-
tion. In particular Mr Charles
Fuller seems, like Custer, to
be leading RCSU to a singularly
avoidable massacre.
The end of RCSU will not be
an act of dissolution but some-
thing far worse—The Union will
irrelevant, unnecessary and
finally unsupported.
