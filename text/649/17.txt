BITES THE DUST
As the caption says, Pinocchio bites the dust. I mustjust take this
opportunity to thank everyone; Perola (especially), Fuz'zychops,
Scaramouche, Ulysses, Gordias, Scapino, Mike, Spuz, Dr
Pretzel, Andy, Lynne James (for being the only other person to
ever have pasted up the whole puzzle page) and everyone else
who has given me, or inspired in me, a puzzle, who I have
unforgivably temporarily forgotten. Also thanks are due to Mary,
Mungo, Midge, Tim and Kathy for allowing themselves to be
frequently lampooned, and of course, to anyone who has ever
entered a puzzle, and made me feel wanted.
The prize puzzles this week are marked with pointers or
arrows. All the others are for your own amusement-good luck
(for the last time) everyone, especially to whoever takes over my
job!
Ever yours. Pinocchio
SHOCKHORRA PROBES
Well, this issue sees the end of an era. The FEELSICK Editor,
Martian Failure, is replaced by young, enthusiastic, debonair, witty
(I really can creep when I want to!) Pallab Shokhorra. Pallab has
already started renaming the college. Since most work goes on in
Huxley during the day, it has been renamed Day. Since a lot goes
on in Southside during the night, it has been renamed Night.
Whenever one goes into the Union Office, one inevitably finds that
things 'will get done tomorrow', the Union Office has been named
Morrow. Pallab has already started causing havoc by issuing
orders; on Monday June 13 at 8:00am (0800hrs), he sent this
memo:
'PEOPLE NOW AT DAY WILL PROCEED T O NIGHT T O
MORROW STOP PEOPLE NOW AT MORROW WILL PROCEED
TO DAY TO NIGHT STOP PEOPLE NOW AT NIGHT WILL
PROCEED TO MORROW TO DAY.'
At 6:00pm (1800hrs) he broadcasts:
'ORDERS GIVEN THIS MORNING FOR PEOPLE TO PROCEED
TO NIGHT ARE CANCELLED AS FAR AS PEOPLE WHO HAVE
NOT YET MOVED ARE CONCERNED.' "•
At midnight (2359hrs) he announces:
'PEOPLE WHO WENT TO DAY TO NIGHT WILL RETURN AT
DAYBREAK TO MORROW.'
Now it may be taken that a day is the period ending at 6:00pm
(1800hrs) and night is between 6:00pm and midnight.
On June 15, people stood in various places thus:
At Day 26 people
At Night 24 people
At Morrow 50 people
Assuming that no other people are involved, that no one moved
unless they were ordered to, and that, where an order appears to
be capable of two interpretations, half the people to whom it might
apply interpret it in one sense and half in the other, what was the
distribution of these people at 8:00am on June 13?
