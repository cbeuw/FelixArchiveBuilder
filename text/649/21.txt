Leaving College?
Don't leave without
your Railcard.
Unless Mummy and Daddy are awfiilly rich,
you could well be leaving college without a bean to your
name. Further, we'd hazard a guess that, no matter how
brilliant your prospects, your first job is unlikely to be the
chairmanship of one of Britain's blue chip companies.
In other words, your modest financial position is
likely to persist for some time.
Never fear, British Rail are here. With the promise
of half price rail travel as long as you're under 24.
The Young Person's Railcard is available to everyone
under 24 (and mature students over 24). It costs just
£12 (within reach of even the most impoverished
graduate) and means you can normally get half price
travel on Ordinary and Awayday tickets (subject to
certain minimum fares).
The Railcard lasts a full 12months from the date
of purchase. And you can use it to travel the length
and breadth of the country - even on some
Sealink ferries.
("all in at your station, British Rail
appointed travel agent or Student Travel
Office and ask for a leaflet.
If you bring two recent passport photos,
proof you're under 24 and £12 (£10 before
19 June) with you, you can buy a Young
Person's Railcard on the spot.
If you still think jt's going to be a pinch to
afford a Railcard, you could always suggest Mummy
and Daddy buy one as a graduation present...
