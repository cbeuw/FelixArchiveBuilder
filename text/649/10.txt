and so we say farewell to
Below the Belt with its unending
saga of ludicrous peccadillos and
frightful faiix pas. This is the last
gossip column I shall be writing,
and so here, for what they're
worth, are all the stories I have
been saving up throughout the
year.
Thanks arc due to everyone
who has supplied any scandal, or
has even created it for the benefit
of this column.
Enjoy your summer, but don't
use it to do anything too rash—
Pallab's style in gossip will be
much more aggressive than mine!
I A M frequently astonished
at the way demure young ladies
occasinally lapse into language
that would raise eyebrows at a
Mines bar night. Mary Freeman,
for instance, occasionally
announced to all the world and
nobody in particular that she
was not wearing any underwear;
and at the Wind Band's outdoor
Christmas concert a perfectly
charming female clarinettist was
heard to pronounce the weather
so cold that 'if I had any goolies
they would be frozen off.
But events have taken a much
more serious turn, and the
clarinettist in question has been
making salacious bargains with
one of the inmates of Linstead
Hall. His part of the deal was to
allow her to join him while he
was in the bath, and perform
certain 'favours' for him. Alas,
the back-scrubbing turned to
Back-stabbing (shades of Char-
lotte Corday?) when the girl
refused to carry out her part of
the deal and parade through the
corridors of Linstead in a flimsy
negligee.
Unless she changes her mind
soon, we may well be seeing
more of the photograph below.
BUT EVEN that tale offilthand
depravity pales against an article
submitted for publication in the
Alternative Prospectus by the
normally staid incoming DP
Christine Teller:
'Eating a Mooney is like
having a wank. It's all right once
in a while,.but if you do it too
often your knob drops off.' The
Welfare Officer has been noti-
fied.
TIME AT LAST, I suppose, to
relate the curious tale of Mike
the tall dark bespectacled
youngster from QEC who was
always looking for Martin S
Taylor but never managed to
find him.
BELOW
The story begins on May 2
last, when Martin, without
warning anyone of his intentions,
shaved off his beard. The
immediate change in appearance
was so striking that he decided
to enlist the help of some friends
in completely disguising himself.
He dyed his hair and put on a
pair of clear glass spectacles. He
padded his mouth with lumps of
cotton wool to change the shape
of his face; he altered the colour
of his lips with lip gloss. He
changed his customary leather
jacket, corduroy jeans and
trainers for a short sleeved shirt,
ripped denims and open sandals.
And finally, he spent an evening
practising different mannerisms
and altering his voice from its
normal light tenor to a lisping
baritone. And thus Mike was
born.
The result was that early the
following afternoon Nick Pyne
wandered in to the F E L I X
Office and introduced his friend
Mike Barker who was hoping to
meet Martin to discuss the
printing of QEC's magazine in
the ICU print unit. Martin,
curiously enough, wasn't there
and so Mike, who had no
lectures that afternoon, decided
to wait for him in the FELIX
Office and chat to the rest of
staff while he waited.
All credit must be duly given
to the Business Manager Peter
Rodgers, the Reviews Editor Lee
Paddon, and paster-upper La
Iatrou who saw through the
disguise almost immediately; the
rest of the staff were completely
taken in.

Pinocchio, normally a highly
shrewd and observant man, was
drawn into a good twenty
minute discussion with the
newcomer before his jaw sud-
denly dropped and he buried his
head in his hands quietly
muttering 'Oh shit' to himself.
LAD TO hear that ecoen
trie scientists have not
entirely died out. Peter
Bradshaw, Professor of
E x p e r i m e n t a l Aero-
dynamics at Imperial
College, is renowned at
IC as a man who never
walks when he can run.
So frantically busy is
Bradshaw that when visi-
tors want to be shown
around the Department
he hands them a floor
plan, a cassette recorder
and a tape containing his
explanatory remarks, and
remains in his office
workiiis.

Clipped from the pages of the
New Standard; FELIX tried to
interview Professor Bradshaw,
but he was too busy.
Maz Fellows, the photo-
typesetter operator, just looked
totally bewildered when Martin
in his own voice, asked her if she
would typeset an article for him.
Stephen Goulder wandered
into the office and began to
explain to Mike how the stapling
machine works—he gave quite
an interesting explanation as it
turned out, the more so since
none of the FELIX staff have
ever mastered it.
Printer Peter Dawson refused
to believe that Mike was really
Martin in disguise, while the
pretty and delightful Lynne
James later admitted that she
had been quite attracted to this
strange quiet guy who was giving
her so much advice on pasting-
up; but he dropped enormously
in her estimation when he made
a pathetic attempt at a joke by
pretending to be the FELIX
Editor.
'Don't be so stupid!' she
snapped T know Martin Taylor
and he's nothing like you.'
But the two who were fooled
most successfully were the
Editor-elect, Pallab Ghosh and
the News Editor, Adrian James.
Pallab was introduced to Mike
and, in Martin's absence, felt it
his duty to show the stranger
around the office, explaining the
mysteries of offset-litho and
camera-ready artwork in his
usual diffident manner. It
apparently never occurred to
him that some of the questions
he was asked were extraordin-
arily naive, while others showed
remarkable insight into the
difficulties of running a print
shop.
It wasn't until early evening
that almost everyone was in on
the joke except Adrian, who had
had little to do with Mike but
was getting increasingly agitated
about Martin's non-appearance.
Eventually Mike enquired
