a definitive guide to surviving the summer
Karen Stott, Student Services, new Welfare Assistant, has
produced this report to help you recognise and deal with the
problems that you might encounter over the summer.

Summer Vacation
Are you - fretting over how
you're going to fill all those long
summer days until the beginning
of October? Or are you seeking
some remunerative employment
in an attempt to wipe out this
year's overdraft? Either way
staying in London could be the
answer to your problems. Many
students spend three years or
more in London without ever
really sampling the delights of
our capital city, so why not
spend all or part of your summer
vacation here and get to know
What London is truly like. On
the other hand London also
abounds with large department
stores who regularly seek extra
staff during the summer so why
not combine work and holiday.
Either way Imperial is offering
accommodatin in IC Halls for
both staff and students at
termtime rates throughout the
summer. Although the closing
date for applications has offici-
ally passed, we do still have
vacancies, so if you're interested
it's not too late to collect an
application form from Student
Services.
You may also have some
friends or relatives who want to
spend some time in London over
the summer. Again we can offer
accommodation at very cheap
rates so why not call into
Student Services for further
details.
Next Year
Obviously many of you are now
anxious to start the search for
accommodation for next year.
Although October may not seem
far away to you, unfortunately
most private landlords/ladies do
not plan their accommodation
this far in advance and therefore
Students Services do not become
informed of the vast majority of
accommodation until September.
We do have a limited amount of
accommodation for next session
on our files at the moment, and
we are currently in the process of
contacting some of our regular
landlords/ladies to assess what
they will have available, so if for
any reason you cannot use
September to find accommoda-
tion, it is worth calling into
Student Services to see if we can
help. We do also hjive an
updated guide to some agencies
who may be able to help you
although most of these are again
reluctant to take registrations
from people too far in advance.
If you are able to come down
to London in September, this is
by far the best time to look. We
should be able to accommodate
you in IC Hall any time up to
September 24 (just give us a ring
on 01-589 5111 ext 2033 one
week before you come down)
after that there will be crash pad
accommodation in the students'
union (bring a sleeping bag). At
that time Student Services
should have comprehensive lists
of vacancies and an accommo-
dation guide to give you hints on
where to start. You may not
discover the home of your
dreams but with a little patience,
footwork and a lot of 5p pieces
you should be able to find
something quite reasonable.

MEDICAL TREATMENT
ABROAD
Hopefully anyone planning to
travel the high seas and see the
world during the summer will
have read Dr Addenbrooke's
article in FELIX (3 June 1983)
about the importance of consult-
ing your doctor well in advance
of your journey to ensure you
have the necessary health
protection in the form of
immunisations etc. Before a
foreign holiday the last thing
you want to worry about is the
possibility of illness or an
accident while you are away. But
these things could happen and if
they do you won't want the
added problem of facing a big
bill for medical treatment. So it's
essential you check your entitle-
ment to medical treatment
before you leave the UK.
Most of Europe, New Zealand
or Hong Kong
If you are visiting one of these
countries you will normally be
entitled to free or reduced cost
medical treatment. Student
Services has a leaflet which lists
the countries to which this
applies, the treatment for which
you are eligible, and the docu-
ments you will need to produce
(usually your UK passport, NHS
medical card and/or UK driving
licence).
If you are visiting another
European Community country
you will need to apply for an El 1
certificate from the DHSS at
least one month before you
leave. Application forms for
these are available from Student
Services. In most community
countries medical treatment is
