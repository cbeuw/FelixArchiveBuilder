In his last opinion article this year, moralist Michael
Newman questions our attitudes to work, play,
politics, life, the Universe and everything and re-
commends that we start
Breaking Glass
Cages
I arrived at this college with
trepidation, for not only was it
the first time I would have to
fend for myself but I felt afraid
of the large city and the new
people I would have to meet. I
was also very excited. I was
actually going to study at a
university, a community of
learning and intellectual debate.
My father, who studied at LSE
in philosophy and ecnomics,
must take some responsibility
for the exaggerated idea of an
oasis of thought in the desert of
conformity and socialisation.
It was within the first few
weeks that I began to realise I
had been so wrong in my
expectations. In the last three
years I had been arguing at my
school, a boys' grammar school,
that one sure place of self-
awareness and critical and lively
informed conversation were our
institutions of further education,
our universities. It seemed to me
then, as it does still, that we are
not taught or even brought up in
an environment of questioning,
of Bertrand Russell's liberating
doubt. That so many of our
attitudes, beliefs and arguments
are accepted without the 'consent
of our deliberate reason',
without a concerted and con-
scious effort on our behalves to
seek and question the assump-
tions, the validity, the very
meanings of the words and the
consequences of our beliefs.
Instead we seek comfort in their
popularity, our own ignorance
and the common use of such
terms as obvious, natural,
reality, inevitable, freedom and
the use of dehumanising labels.
When would we be taught or
encouraged to break our minds
out of their internment in their
own glass cages of accepted
ideas? From my experience it
was not likely to be our primary
schools, our secondary schools,
or our parents—>who are pro-
ducts of the same system. The
only hope was our universities.
At least here there should be the
opportunity to widen and free
our minds of the restraints of
our upbringing.
Yet this was not to be so,
though the opportunities are
here I had forgotten the effect of
18 to 19 years of general
socialisation and the strength of
the glass walls of heavily
engraved prejudices and beliefs.
When this is coupled to a heavy
academic timetable one cannot
be surprised at the philosophical
and political apathy a number of
first years comment on before
being dragged down by it.
We are simply here to have a
good time and gain sufficient
qualifications for a nice job and
social status. This is just another

section of the conveyor belt as
portrayed in Pink Floyd's The
Wall. We are being processed
into a commodity for the
decreasing job market.
The concept of institutional
education being the base of a
free and democratic system
encouraging doubt, inquisitive-
ness and enquiry before decision
making, breaking glass cages, is
subjugated to a factory for the
production and selection of
appropriate labour skills. There
are exceptions of course and
there are attempts to lessen the
effects of this mass production
(eg the Humanities Department),
but they do not counter the
overall emphasis of the system
and its major purpose as ex-
pressed by its structure and its
products.

This apathy is understandable
and, so long as you accept my
explanations, can be changed.
To bring about this change, like
with any change in human
attitudes and behaviour, we
must criticise, we must let our
voices be heard. What is less
understandable, indeed exasper-
ating, is not that we simply find
apathy but we find those who
not only defend it but ironically
actively encourage it. There are
people who try to prevent the
active and interested from using
the Union as one outlet for their
views. The Union should not
discuss anything to do with
politics, it has nothing to do with
politics and should not debate it.
The editor of Morning Cloud
among others holds this opinion.
It is true that a union whose
members are disproportionately
male, and who are studying
topics that involve atomic
power, uranium miningj the
nature of human behaviour and
desires, industry etc, who are
possibly future employees of the
MoD or South Africa, who are
possibly members of a union
which sells pornography (eg
Hon Porn Night), who are not
members of the NUS, and who
are being affected by education
cuts, is not involved in politics?
Using the common rhetoric of
my opponents, when will they
take their heads out of the sand?
The nature of democracy is
that it is a system of government
that gives responsibility for
governing to all society's mem-
bers. We express our choice of
what kind of government we
wish to give power not just in
our votes but in our conversa-
tions with others in pubs, in our
homes, on the street, on TV, in
letters, at U G M s . We can
actively persuade or simply
inform and in doing so we
support a way of government
and the politics we would like to
see followed. Simply by talking
or even deciding not to talk we
immediately become involved in
the democratic process, in
politics. The very nature of
democracy is that you cannot
escape. We are all responsible to
some degree for the type of
government we have whether we
voted or not and whatever way
we voted unless we do not have
the ability to comprehend the
decisions facing us. We are faced
with the choices of whether to
vote, for whom to vote, whether
to talk about politics, which
particular set of policies we
would support in conversation
and indeed is our everyday
behaviour. I believe we do not
comprehend enough these

choices, something not due to
lack of ability but a result of
prejudice and ignorance. You
must not blame the democratic
system for the type of govern-
ment and society we have, you
must blame the people, including
yourself. The education system
should be the safeguarder of
democracy, it should diminish
not only ignorance but indoc-
trination, socialisation and
apathy. In this it fails.
As our Union is a democratic
society we, its members, can be
said to be responsible for its
actions. If our Union fails to
criticise such dangers as porno-
graphy then we are responsible.
If it goes further and actively
sells pornography, advertising
its sales, trying to raise as much
money as possible from the sales
even if it's only once or twice a
year at Hon Porn Night we are
responsible. We are all respon-
sible. It is in our power as a
collective force to prevent the
institutionalised selling of
pornography but we fail and it
goes on. I am responsible. Those
who picketed the Mines Revue
are responsible, the Rector is
responsible, you are responsible.
In the end when the institu
tionalised sale of pornography
or its showing is banned we will
all be responsible, in part.
Many people have claimed it
is the individual's right to seek
entertainment in whatever
manner s/he pleases as long as it
does not hurt anyone and is
done in private. This is not the
issue at stake; this right is not to
be taken from us, it is a right
mostly guarded in law. What we
are all faced with in this demo
cratic system is whether our
Union should sell pornography
Whether we want to be faced
with the responsibility of
allowing this sale to continue. It
is not as some people proclaim
nothing to do with them-
simple matter of deciding
whether to go or not. It is not a
matter of simply allowing people
to purchase porn. It is a matter
of being able to stop a body you
belong to from expressing an
active support for the porno-
graphic industry in its actions or
organised events and not doing
so.
If you disagree with the
showing of pornography and
think it is possiby dangerous
then perceive your responsibi
lities, criticise people and make
decisions that can and will
eventually stop the active
presence of the pornographii
industry and market within our
college.
