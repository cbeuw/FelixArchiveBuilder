Room for
Improvement
Dear Martin
The College authorities are, as
we all know, a model of effi-
ciency which could well be
copied by many parts of British
Industry.
To illustrate this model of
high efficiency let me tell you a
tale of a room bill.
This room bill (for room 144
Falmouth-Keogh) for the sum-
mer term was duely paid by the
occupant of the room: Who then
received the usually worded
reminder, which was of course
ignored (the bill having been
paid).
Then the threatening letters
started to arrive and the occupant
was informed that his depart-
ment and warden had been
informed of his non payment of
fees, until eventually the letter
threatening the withholding of
the degree arrived,
v Mr 144 Falmouth then went
to see Michael Arthur, with his
signed stamped receipt, Mr
Arthur contacted Cashiers, who
seemed a trifle doubtful of Mr
144's word (and the receipt) but
Mr 144 and Mr Arthur prevailed
and one letter of apology was
sent to Mr 144's department.
But still the cash office
prevailed until on June 7 Mr
144's Senior Tutor was again
contacted and Mr 144 was
summoned to the cash office to
account for the non-presence of
his cheque.
Being an obliging sort of chap
he went to his bank to try and
see if he could trace the where-
abouts of the elusive paper, as
the cash office had been thor-
oughly checked, perhaps he had
filled in the cheque wrongly and
it had been sent back to Student
Services after all third year
electrical engineers have diffi-
culty with figures and writing
their names.
Whilst Mr 144 was still in the
enquiries queue at the bank the
cheque was discovered. Where?
In the cash office.
OK, not too much hassle you
may think except that whilst all
this has been going on Mr 144
has been sitting his finals and
doing his final year project. He
did of course get a verbal
apology to make up for all the
threatening correspondence. But
still it's nice to know Imperial is
the last bastion of British
efficiency.

The one w
e
had to print
Dear Martin
I hope that you will publish
this letter in the next issue of
FELIX—your last as Editor.
What I have to say I know to be
felt by many students of Imperial
College and was in part voiced
by Tim Williams in a previous
issue.
Throughout my three years at
this College, FELIX has never
been as good a newspaper as it
was over the past twelve months.
On many occasions, I have had
the opportunity to ^glance
through the official newspapers
from other colleges and they
come nowhere near the standard
of FELIX. I know for a fact that
the readership of the paper
extends beyond our College and
I am proud that we have such an
excellent College publication.
I hope that your successor
(whom I voted for incidentally)
can live up to the very high
standards that you have set. Of
course, in this letter I am
praising all those who have
worked on FELIX because I
know that quite a few people
lend their services, especially on
Thursday evernings, to ensure
that the paper gets to us on
Friday morning.
I think that credit should be
given where it is due and on this
occasion you and your team
have deservedly earned it!
Yours

Thoughts on
libel
Dear Martin
I am glad to see that you are
taking Mr Fuller's threat of legal
action as the joke it plainly is. As
you are no doubt aware, to
prove libel it is necessary to
show that the offending state-
ments) were false and would
tend to lower the 'standing' of
the Plaintiff in the eyes of his
peers. It would appear to me
that proving either of these
would be beyond the capabilities
of even the most competent
lawyer!
The reason that I am able to
offer this advice is that a fellow
STOIC member (I am informed)
entertained the notion of pursu
ing a similar action against me
last term over a passage you
published in 'Below the Belt'—a
prospect that caused me much
amusement. In that case, how-
ever, a rather more fundamental
obstacle existed^namely that it
is necessary to prove that the
defendant wrote the offending
article—which (as you know,
Martin) he would have found
impossible!
Perhaps Mr Fuller, and
anyone else who may be con-
sidering libel actions, should
bear these points in mind before
paying a Solicitor vast sums of
money to tell them the same
thing.
Yours legally
