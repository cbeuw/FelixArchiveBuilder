abroad you will not be entitled
to any benefit whilst you are out
of the country and you must
start a completely new claim as
soon as you return.
Co-habiting: When an un-
married couple live together as
husband and wife they are
treated as a married couple for
benefit purposes. The offical
reason for this regulation is to be
fair to married couples, but since
a married couple receive con-
siderably less benefit than two
single people it is easy to see
another reason for the per-
sistence with which this regu-
lation is followed up. If you are
classified as co-habiting the
woman loses her eligibility to
claim in her own right and the
man has to claim for her as a
dependent. To avoid being
classed as a couple you will have
to prove that the two of you live
totally independently as regards
rent and other bills, and you will
usually need to prove you have
your own rooms. If you feel you
have been unjustly classified
then appeal (see below).
Appeals: If you feel your
benefit has been incorrectly or
unfairly assessed don't be afraid
to appeal. Both the DHSS and
the local housing authority have
considerable discretionary
powers when deciding your
benefit and it is your right to
challenge their discretion. With
both supplementary and housing
benefit you have the right to a
full written breakdown of the
way in which your benefit was
assessed, together with the right
to appeal to a supplementary
benefit tribunal or local authori-
ty review board whichever is
appropriate. However, delay in
asking for a review could cause
you to lose your right to appeal.
So if you are unsure about your
benefit write to the relevant
authority as early as possible
asking for a full breakdown and
indicating your intention to
appeal if necessary. If you want
to know more about the appeals
procedure, Student Services can
give you an outline of what
happens and represent you at a
tribunal or review board if you
so wish.
A final note: if you are
unemployed over the summer
you should be able to get some
benefits providing you follow
the rules. However if you do
have problems with your claim
call into the Student Services
Office or give us a ring on 589
5111 ext 2033 and we should be
able to help sort things out.

Most of you will hopefully have
seen the article in FELIX last
term concerning the House of
Lords judgement in December
1982 regarding overseas students,
local education authority awards
and, in particular, the definition
of the term 'ordinary residence'.
For those who missed that
article here is a brief resume.
Various education acts from
1962 onwards have placed a duty
on local education authorities
(LEAs) to bestow mandatory
awards in respect of attendance
at first degree courses on anyone
'ordinarily resident' ip the UK
for the three years preceeding the
start of the course in question
(subject to certain exceptions).
These regulations made no
mention of the applicant's place
of origin, domicile or nationality,
and no hint was given to the
intended meaning of 'ordinarily
resident' although most authori-
ties followed the advice offered
by the Department of Education
and Science in circular A C L
1/78 namely applying what is
known as the 'real home' test to
applicants. Under this test
persons in the U K solely or
mainly for educational purposes
during the three years preceeding
their degree course were not
deemed to be 'ordinarily resident'
and many grants were refused on
these grounds.
In December 1982 five of
these cases appeared before the
House of Lords for their judge-
ment on the matter. The Lords
rejected the 'real home' test as
inappropriate and ruled that the
term 'ordinarily resident' should
be given its natural and ordinary
meaning, ie 'has the applicant
shown that he has habitually and
normally resided in the UK from
choice and for a settled purpose
throughout the prescribed
period, apart from temporary or
occasional absences' (Lord
Scarman). In addition the Lords
ruled that education could be
counted as a settled purpose
thereby opening the doors for
many students who had pre-
viously been rejected by LEAs
on the grounds of 'ordinary
residence' to re-apply.
For the next few months most
LEAs, besieged by reapplicants.
refused to make any moves until
promised guidance appeared
from the DES. Now at last new
hope has dawned in the form of
DES circular A C L 2/83 dis-
tributed to LEAs on March 30
1983. Although DES circulars
are not binding on LEAs it is
likely that most LEAs will
interpret the Lords judgement
according to the DES guidelines.
The major part of these guide-
lines are reproduced here.
The circular issues guidelines
on which cases should be eligible
for reconsideration:
'It is...for authorities to decide
whether or not to reopen cases in
which they think, in the light of
the House of Lords judgement,
they may have wrongly refused a
student a mandatory award by
applying an incorrect test of
ordinary residence'.
Tn the Secretary of State's
view...LEAs should be prepared
in principle to reconsider cases
where the refusal of an award
was in respect of a course
beginning in the academic year
1979/80 or later, but save in
exceptional circumstances they
should not reconsider a refusal
of an award made earlier than
that.'
But it also makes restrictions:
'The duty of a local education
authority to bestow an award is
subject to the condition that the
student has made an application
for an award in writing before
the end of the term in which he
commences his course. If no
such application has been made
the question of review of a
refusal to grant an award does
not arise. If the L E A has no
record of having received such
an application, it will normally
be for the student to satisfy the
LEA that he did in fact make
one.'
'LEAs may receive repre-
sentations from students who
did not apply for an award for a
course they are now following
because they mistakenly thought
themselves ineligible. There is no
reason in law why authorities
should entertain such repre-
sentations but allowance of a
late application is at the LEA's
discretion.'
In addition the circular
suggests that LEAs should
require written representations
for the reconsideration of each
case to be made to the appropri-
ate LEA by July 31 1983.
In short, any student who
began their undergraduate
course on or after October 1979
and who had been 'ordinarily
resident' in the UK for at least
three years preceeding the start of
their course whether or not this
was in full-time education,
should be eligible for a manda-
tory award for their under-
graduate course providing they
made an application in writing
to their LEA for such an award
before the end of the first term of
their course and providing they
write to the same L E A asking
for their case to be reconsidered
before July 31 1983.
Any student who fails to fulfil
either of these provisions is
likely to have a tough battle
getting an award but do put in
an application and if you feel
you have a strong case, call into
Student Services and we'll see if
we can help. Student Services are
trying to make a survey of the
success of re-applicants so if you
have made, or are going to
make, an application for an
award please let Student Services
know as this issue is of national
interest.
Clearly the Lords decision was
unpopular at the DES and
solicitors there spent many
troubled hours perusing ways
around the judgement. Although
they have now accepted the
rights of re-applicants to retro-
spective awards, the addition of
a short paragraph to the regu-
lations, effective from March 31
1983, has ensured that in future
periods spent in the UK wholly
or mainly for the purpose of
receiving full-time education will
not count towards the three year
'ordinary residence' require-
ments for mandatory awards.
This new provision applies to all
applications to awards for
courses beginning in the aca-
demic years 1982/3 and 1983/4
which L E A s have not yet
decided.
Fees
New regulations are soon to be
placed before Parliament con-
cerning the future classification
of students as overseas for fees
purposes. In the meantime the
College are still awaiting guid-
ance from the DES regarding the
classification for fees purposes
of students who are currently
studying at, or have recently left,
Imperial.
