about the twisty wooden stair-
case which leads out of the
FELIX Office, and was told that
it leads up to the Editor's private
room which is always locked
when the Editor isn't there. He
cautiously negotiated the steps
and knocked gently on the door,
which is out of sight, but within
earshot of the main office.
The door was briskly opened.
'Mike!' exclaimed Martin in his
own voice 'come in!'.
The door was closed again,
and sounds of muffled conversa-
tion issued forth for about five
minutes, and then came the
sounds of the door opening once
more.
'See you again then,' said
Martin, 'and do get in touch if
you want that printing done.'
Mike climbed down the stairs
and faced the rest of the office
with an embarrassed smile. 'He
was upstairs all the time,' he
lisped.
Adrian, who was by now quite
annoyed with Martin, stormed
upstairs and burst into the
Editor's empty office returning a
few seconds later completely
baffled to find the rest of the
staff—and Martin—helpless
with laughter.
UNION POLICY is that sexual
intercourse is forbidden in the
Union Building except when
'discreet and unavoidable'.
Leaving aside the question of
how it can ever be totally
unavoidable ('she was lying
there with her legs apart, m'lud,
and as I walked towards her I
tripped over the rug') I am
pleased to relate that at least one
couple have coupled discreetly
and unavoidably in one of the
Union rooms.
Considerable pressure has
been put on me to reveal their
names, but since they were most
discreet, and since their deed was
unavoidable at least in the sense
that they had nowhere else to go,
I shall keep silent.
Nevertheless, I think it should
be recorded that there are people
making use of this, one of the
less obvious facilities provided
by the Union.

from the Yellow Pages
AND SO, at last, inevitably,
since this is the last of these
columns I shall write, here are a
F E U X H H H H H H H 1
handful of stories from the very
top.
The first concerns Lady Mary,
the garrulous and delightfully
scatty first lady of IC who
always likes to leave the impres-
sion that, however great her
husband's importance outside
170 Queensgate, there is no
doubt who is in charge at home.
On this particular occasion,
she excused herself from a
formal gathering, explaining
that she had to get home to
make the beds for some guests
she was expecting. Someone
jokingly suggested that Brian
ought to offer to help—at least,
it was intended as a joke, but
Lady Mary took it quite serious-
iy-
'Dear me no,' she replied. 'He
hasn't time to make the beds—
he's still got the washing up to
do.'
YET IT'S a great pity that Lord
Flowers has acquired this image
of being so dull, for beneath his
lugubrious exterior there is
an undoubtedly brilliant mind.
It has also been widely ru-
moured that he was once a
young man with an under-
graduate sense of humour, like
many of us, and I am happy to
be able to offer two tales
confirming this.
The first concerns an occasion
when, as a Cambridge under-
graduate, he gained access to
Newnham College, one of the
two girls' colleges, and actually
took a bath there. Considering
the way students behave in
Linstead these days, this may
not sound like much, but in that
age this was a fearful and daring
thing to do. Before you were
allowed to visit a girl in her
room, her bed had to be carried
into the corridor; to be caught
taking a bath would certainly
have incurred the wrath of one's
tutor, if not the dean himself.
One might as well try to take a
bath in a Hall Warden's flat or
even 170 Queensgate.
The second story concerns
an independent contemporary of
our future Rector who was the
subject of much cruel humour in
that he had trouble with his
bladder, and this occasioned him
to use the lavatory several times
a night. This character (who had
a highly appropriate name which
I have inexcusably forgotten—
something like Piddlewick)
regularly disturbed the sleep of
the undergraduates on his
staircase as he tramped the
hundred yards or so to the
nearest loo. So it came as a great
relief to all parties when he
• • • • • • • • • • J u n e 16,
equipped his room with a
chamber pot.
Unfortunately, this only
reinforced the jokes against him,
and when the receptacle was
next left unguarded, the youthful
Brian took the opportunity of
doctoring it with certain chemi-
cals.
That night a vigil was main-
tained outside Piddlewick's
room, and a couple of hours
after he had retired the listeners
were rewarded. First came the
clump of a pair of feet hitting the
floor and walking across the
room, and then the sound of a
cascade of liquid hitting earth-
enware. Finally there were
squeals of disbelief as the
reaction in the pot produced a
fluid that was strongly phos-
phorescent.
What I now ask is how anyone
can feel animosity towards a
Rector who has shown such
imagination in his humour.
J O H N M c C A L L I O N , ICU's
saintly Deputy President, has
been attacking RCSU pretty
viciously of late, so I thought I'd
include a little story to show they
aren't quite as black as they're
painted.
Last year, you may remember,
Guilds had a lot of trouble when
their annual magazine Spanner
was mislaid. They phoned the
printers, who assured them it
had been delivered to Imperial,
but it wasn't until several days
had passed that they discovered
every single copy had found its
way into the RCSU Office.
Guilds never discovered how
this came about, but I am now in
a position to tell them.
The printers, knowing nothing
of IC's tradition of kleptomania
unwisely left them all in the
Summer Accommodation Centre
where a wily undergraduate
mathematician, deciding it
might be fun to ransom them,
phoned the RCS President and
suggested he steal them.
And who do you suppose that
mathematician could have been?
Why, none other than your
friend and mine, Mr J J
McCallion.
ONE FINAL snippet from the
boss: the reason the President's
annual two thousand word
report was submitted late was
that after it was written Stephen
managed to lose it. He spent well
over two hours looking for it
before it turned up in his waste-
paper basket where someone
had thrown it, he says, by
mistake.
THOSE OF YOU who were here
two years ago will remember
Steve Marshall's expose of
freemasonry, which is rife at IC.
It has come to my attention
that a prominent figure in the
Union has been elected to the IC
Lodge, and will be undergoing
initiation this Saturday evening,
dressed in the appropriate
manner as modelled by M r
Marshall in the photograph.
While I couldn't possibly
bring myself to name this feflpw,
I realise many of you are bound
to be curious as to his identity,
and so, somewhere subtly
hidden in this week's FELIX, I
have included the slightest
possible indication of who the .
new recruit might be.
THE UNION STAFF had quite
a surprise during the last
vacation when a letter arrived
addressed to one of the officers
• of the Transcendental Medita-
tion Society. The Union always
open letters which arrive during
the holidays, in case they contain
urgent bills or other business; in
this case they contained tickets
for a Transcendental Meditation
conference which had been
ordered some weeks previously.
The title of the conference,
which the Union staff couldn't
help but notice was Transcen-
dental Meditation and its use in
increasing sexual drive and
potency.
