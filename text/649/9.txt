THE
CHANGING
Martin S Taylor,
Computing Scientist,
FELIX Editor,
A man barely alive. .
Miners, Guildsmen, Scien-
tists, lend me your eyes, I
come to bury Martin not to
praise him.
Most people at College have
probably come across Martin S
Taylor in some capacity or other
during this year, be it as a
magician, a hypnotist, an occa-
sional percussionist in orchestra
and wind band, as choir chairman
elect or as the annoying individual
who tells you that you've missed
the copy deadline for this week's
FELIX. We're not going to bore
you with things you already
know — we'd like to tell you
something about the Martin you
don't know
Once upon a time, long, long
ago, in the land of Brum was born
a lanky child, the very epitome of
mediocrity. And so the die was
cast—it wasn't until some twenty
years later that his natural flair for
dealing with numbers surfaced, as
did Martin with a first class
honours degree, a chaste and
scholarly figure. He immediately
partook of one of the few honour-
able professions left, accountancy
(yawn!), where the character we
have come to know and (in some
cases) love was forged—a new
dynamic personality registered for
an MSc and then a PhD in the
department of computing at
Imperial.
It was during this period that his
penchant for the perverse and
numerical abilities prompted him
to become FELIX puzzles editor
under the improbable pseudonym
of Scaramouche. The trans-
formation was by this time
complete with the shambling gait
and ginger beard (or was that
ginger beer?) reaching the fore
and many of the 'nice' idiosyn-
cracies of Cambridge suppressed.
Frivolous, vindictive, hedonistic
and obese—if Martin had been
any of these he could have followed
in the classic Marshall mould of
slagging everyone off left, right
and centre, alienating most of the
FELIX staff and generally working
hard to get all finished. Instead he
is almost grovellingly kind to (most
of) the staff (at least to their faces)
and consequently is unusually
overwhelmed with help at all
times. This gives him carte
blanche to wander around the
office worrying when things will be
finished, when he can write his
Editorial and 'Below the Belt', and
to tell any hapless minion straying
into the office (perhaps to get
some printing done) that he's far
too busy, and to come back on
Friday. All this mental strain
(though he hardly ever seems
actually to do anything) wears him
out by the end of collating FELIX
on a Thursday evening, with the
result that he takes Friday off
Gentlemen, we can re-
build him. We have the
technology to make the
world's first bionic FELIX
Editor
(leaving the rest of the FELIX staff
to deal with all those people he
told to come and see him).
FELIX has taken vast strides in
technical and layout fields under
Martin's editorial leadership—
principally because Martin leaves
these things in the capable hands
of others on the staff, devoting his
efforts to the exploitation of
freebies (in the best tradition of
previous FELIX editors), for
instance ballooning, parachute
jumping and haute coiffeur (Chez
Renetly.)
But perhaps the thing that will
most stand out from Martin's year
of leadership are his eccentricities
(and the endless stream of gossip
which this provides for the staff).
His strange views on fashion—the
combination of shirt daringly
unbuttoned to the chest, revealing
a string vest which he has
possessed since the age of ten are
peculiar to Martin — and his
fixation with the temperature in
his room in Southside are only
mild manifestations. Then there is
his habit of cycling alone on a
tandem (with the seat set high
enough to make ycur eyes water!),
although this is explainable when
you consider his preoccupation
with womanising (he proudly
boasts of his specially shaped
ladies' back seat—say no more!).
On the subject of womanising, we
were going to offer a list of all
those Martin has tried to seduce,
but, as you can see we're quite
short of space, and lists of names
do take a lot of space (witness last
week's colours lists), so we'll leave
that out.
One of the mystifying aspects of
Martin's behaviour has been his
complete change of image in
early May—suggestions for the
reason for this have been many
and varied, so we will now reveal
all—the 'image change' was so
that no one would concentrate on
the fact that he had shaved, and all
this within two days of his being
told (by none other than resident
arch-loony Nick Gardner) that
he had nits in his beard!).
But fun and sniping apart,
Martin has this year led FELIX to
new heights of journalism, with a
new and distinctive style (which
was not, unfortunately always best
suited to our limited resources)
and has been (on the whole) an
excellent editor with which to
work. We wish him all the best for
the future, and hope he can finish
his PhD before the age of thirty.
It only remains to warn of the
onset of the tenure of Pallab
Ghosh—frivolous, vindictive,
hedonistic
