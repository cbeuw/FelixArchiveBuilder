Peter Parker Packs a Peck
Do you remember the Kitlinbuckton puzzle? If not, then tough. If
you do, then you'll remember the map shown here. Can you tell
me the maximum number of restaurant cars Sir Peter Carr-
Parker-Tendant can put in the train, and still turn the train
round?
The train is: locomotive, second class carriage, a number of
restaurant cars, and a Pullman coach. The locomotive and
Pullman car must leave facing the same way (with regard to the
direction of travel) as they arrived.

Just Steels A Joint
During the Easter vacation a terrible scandal
blew-up at Primelia College. A black-market in
contraceptives was discovered operating in the
Westwall .Halls of Residence.
Always a fast mover, Just Reefer the Chief
Security Officer, visited the Halls and dragged
off the first 100 students he found for
interrogation. His intention Was to find out if
Welfare Officer Joint Barnite was behind the
whole thing.
Just's prisoners consisted of 99 mathe-
maticians and physicists and one theoretical
physicist. For the benefit of the Arts students
among you I should explain that as physicists
deal with the real world they invariably tell the
truth. Mathematicians on the other hand can
postulate the world to suit themselves and so
are invariant liars. Theoretical physicists,
caught between the two disciplines, usually end
up quite schizophrenic and sometimes tell the
truth whilst lying the rest of the time.
Unfortunately for Just, he could not
distinguish the students by course, although
they all know each other's vocation.
A further complication was that Union
President Steel Goolies, anxious to give Joint
a fair chance (in case he was guilty), allowed
Just only two questions to any or all of the
students in the belief that this would prevent
Just from ascertaining the truth.
Faced with the problem of this mixture of
students and the limitations of two questions
only, Just called on his poet's deviousness and
came up with two questions to determine
(correctly) Joint's guilt or innocence. What
were they and of whom did he ask them?
