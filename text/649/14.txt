provided under insurance
schemes. Getting treatment may
be more complicated than in the
UK, but visitors have to follow
the same rules as local people.
Leaflet SA36 available from
Student Services outlines what
to do about getting medical
treatment in each of the com-
munity countries. Sometimes
treatment is free. Sometimes
you may have to pay part of the
cost yourself. Or you may have
to pay the full cost and then
claim a full or partial refund.
Claim any refund before you
return to the UK. If you leave it
until your return you will face a
long wait, or lose the money
altogether. Follow the rules for
the country you are visiting or
you will have to pay charges that
cannot be refunded. And have
your E l l with you (plus a
photocopy in France, Germany
or the Netherlands). In some
Community countries—and
particularly in Greece—the E l l
does not cover all medical
expenses. It never covers the cost
of repatriation so check with a
travel agent or insurance com-
pany about extra insurance
cover.
Any other countries
If you require medical treatment
in any country other than those
covered above, you will be
expected to meet the full cost of
any treatment. In the case of an
accident or serious illness this
could amount to thousands of
pounds. So you must make sure
you have enough travel insur-
ance to cover any substantial
expenses as these cannot be
reimbursed to you. Travel
insurance can be arranged
through most major insurance
companies including Endsleigh
Insurance (based at 71 Old
Brompton Road) and National
Westminster Insurance Services
(contact Tom Cottrell through
National Westminster Bank,
Sherfield Building) and leaflets
are available from Student
Services. Cost is normally about
£10 per adult for a fortnight's
cover in Europe and the Medi-
terranean area althoug pre-
miums are usually higher for the
USA and Canada.
Motoring Abroad
If you are driving anywhere
abroad, including those coun-
tries where you would normally
be entitled to free or reduced
rate medical treatment, you may
not be covered for the treatment
you need if you have an accident.
Check this with your car insur-
ance company or motoring
organisation before you leave
the UK.

BENEFITS FOR THE
SUMMER VACATION
Unlike the Christmas and Easter
holidays, there is no element
included in the student grant to
cover maintainance over the
summer vacation and therefore
if you are unable to get a job
between July and October you
will be eligible to 'sign on' as
unemployed in the area in which
you are living. Many of you are
probably 'old hands' at this by
now but as you may be aware
there have been some important
changes in the system since
Easter so as well as providing a
brief guide for the uninitiated,
this article also hopes to give you
an idea of how the new legisla-
tion affects you.
There are three main types of
benefit: unemployment benefit,
supplementary benefit and
housing benefit.
They are not mutually ex-
clusive and therefore it is
possible to receive two or all
FELIXmmkwkwammkmm
three types of benefits simul-
taneously (but only up to a
maximum of approx £25 + rent a
week for a single person).
1. Unemployment Benefit
To be eligible for this you will
have to have paid Class 1
National Insurance contributions
on earnings of at least £1,350
between April 1981 and April
1982. This will give you a basic
rate of £25 per week or a little
less if you do not quite meet the
contribution conditions. You
will automatically be given the
claim forms for unemployment
benefit when you sign on (see
'How to claim' below) but take
your P45 and a note of your
National Insurance number
with you.
2. Supplementary Benefit
Originally conceived as a 'safety
• • • • • • • • • • • June 16,
net' for those unable to meet the
contribution conditions for
unemployment benefit but now
provides the principal source of
income for a large proportion of
the country's unemployed
including most student claim-
ants. Eligibility is primarily
dependent on the claimant's
ability to sign on as available for
work in the area in which they
are living. There are two rates of
benefit—householder and non-
householder. 'Householder'
implies someone who is indivi-
dually responsible for all house-
hold expenses but even if you
share a flat or house with others
but have your own room,
meters, etc, it may be possible to
argue that you are maintaining a
separate household. If you think
you have been incorrectly
classified you can appeal (see
below). The basic rates for
Supplementary Benefit are:
householder £ 2 5 . 7 0 ; non-
householder £20.55.
How to claim Unemployment/
Supplementary Benefit
On the fist weekday of the
vacation go down to your local
unemployment benefit office
(addresses in the phone book)
and sign on as available for
work. They will tell you any
future arrangements for signing
on, get you to fill in a number
of forms and give you a B1 claim
form which should be taken or
sent to the local Supplementary
Benefit Office. You will usually
be called for an interview by this
office and you will need to take
with you proof of identity,
recent bank statements and your
rent book/tenancy agreement/
letter from your landlord
(Student Services if in College
accommodation).
Anyone receiving unemploy-
ment/supplementary benefit is
entitled to free NHS dental
treatment, glasses and prescrip-
tions. So if you think you might
be needing any of them ask for
an exemption certificate whilst
you are at the DHSS office.
3. Housing Benefit
As from April 4 responsibility
for meeting any housing costs
has been shifted onto the local
housing authorities. Two new
types of benefit have been
introduced:
a) Certificated housing bene-
fit: for those recieving supple-
mentary/unemployment benefit
and so called because eligibility
is dependent on receipt of a
certificate of entitlement from
the DHSS. Under this benefit
you may receive 100% of your
housing costs.
b) Standard housing benefit:
replacing the old rent and rate
allowance schemes. Anyone can
apply—the basic rebate is 60%
of your rent with certain addi-
tions or deducations according
to your income.
Special conditions applying to
students during termtime pre-
vent many students from claim-
ing any housing benefit during
the terms although it is always
worth applying. During the
summer students returning to
their parental home will not be
eligible for any housing benefit
but those remaining and 'signing
on' in London should receive
certificated benefit. If you have
to pay a retainer on your term-
time accommodation over the
summer it is worth putting in an
application for standard housing
benefit since this can be paid
whilst you are absent from the
address at which you pay rent
although we do not at present
know how housing authorities
are likely to treat such cases.
How to claim Housing Benefit
If you are receiving unemploy-
ment/supplementary benefit you
don't need to do anything as a
certificate of entitlement should
be sent automatically to the
housing benefit office on your
behalf by the DHSS. For stan-
dard housing benefit call into the
local housing authority office
(usually based in the Town Hall)
for the area in which you are
paying rent, or come into
Student Services and collect a
housing benefit application
form. Your claim will be dated
from the day on which your
completed froms are received by
your local housing office. TJle
housing authority do have the
power previously invested in the
DHSS to reduce the amount
they pay you in certificated cases
if they consider your rent to be
excessively high. If you think
they have used this power
unreasonably you can appeal
(see below).
Some points to note when claim-
ing benefits
Holidays: Housing benefit can
be paid during temporary
absences but you should let the
housing benefit office know your
plans. For unemployment/
supplementary benefit you can
complete a holiday form which
will allow you up to sixteen days
away within the British Isles
without losing benefit but you
must sign on again as soon as
you return. If you go on holiday
