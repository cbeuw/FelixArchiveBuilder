Review of
the Year
As always a review of the
sporting year at IC is a very
pleasant thing to write. A
pleasing aspect of the season
gone by is that whilst established
clubs have performed well, other
lesser known clubs have im-
proved and scored some notable
victories.
The Football Club had a very
good season this year. They
captured the U L U Cup in a
match that, as in all great
matches, went to a replay.
Admittedly their league showing
was not as good. The important
question to ask is what will
happen when Rickard leaves
College. Who can provide the
of over 200. The first team did
well to come second in the first
division but some of the lower
teams were struggling to avoid
relegation. A tour was under-
taken to Paderborn in Germany
which proved to be very success-
ful. Incidentally anyone wanting
to read the full story of this tour
can collect the 115 page 'novel'
from the FELIX Office.
For the first time this year the
Tennis Club competed in a
winter league and performed
creditably.
The martial arts clubs are a
growing area of sport at IC. The
Judo Club is probably the most
established of these and last year
goals he has been scoring for the
last six years.
The Rugby Club could not
repeat the previous year's
success of winning the Gutteridge
Cup. They went out in the first
round to the team they beat in
the final last year. To make up
for this they won the plate
competition. A successful tour
was also completed although
rumours abound about what
went on off the field!
The Hockey Club had numer-
ous successes including their first
snow-bound hockey festival in
Folkestone!! Moving away from
field sports probably the most
successful club was the Bad-
minton Club who, inspired by
their captain, won four leagues
and the U L U Knockout Cup.
They also entertained a team
from Trinity College Dublin—
entertained being the right word.
Staying with racquet clubs the
Squash Club expanded almost to
bursting point with membership

they had their best season yet.
They won the Men's U L U
Championship and were second
in the women's. One of their
members, Keith Stevenson,
achieved the accolade of 1st
Dan (black belt) and many
others increased their grading.
This success was carried on by
the Karate Club who performed
well in the Southern Area
Championships at Poole—
winning one of the ladies events.
Again many people increased
their grading. The newest
martial arts club is the Wing
Chun Club and unfortunately
interest has dwindled in this
club—perhaps we can hope for a
resurgence next year.
Moving along to the water
sport clubs. Boat Club again
performed well although their
biggest event—Henley—is still
to come. Sailing Club improved
their position in the Southern
Universities league. Unfor-
tunately they lost one of the
Castaways Cups but due to a
stroke of good luck a spare
trophy appeared in the Union
Office—any ideas what to do
with it? Their best result of the
year was coming second in an
international tournament in
Tilbury, Holland.
Other clubs that have per-
formed well are the Volleyball
Club, who despite low member-
ship managed to win their league
for the second year running. A
tour abroad is also on the cards
for the club where no doubt they
will smash everyone in sight. The
Rifle Pistol Club are second in
various leagues. The Fencing
Club did well against other
teairts and interest in the club
likes maintained throughout the
year.
The club which deserves a spe-
cial mention is the Cycling Club
under the strong, decisive and
determined leadership of Ronan.
Despite some scepticism on the
part of ACC the Cycling Club
have recently had some excep-
tional results for a new club. The
best of these came in winning the
team prize in the BSSF 50 mile
time trial championship.
Great fun was had at Sports
Day this year although it was
poorly attended. The event
showed great potential for the
future. The events were mainly
dominated by two people—John
Lee and Mike Jones—but I
think it is fair to say that
everyone who took part enjoyed
themselves. Hopefelly this will
be better attended next year.
I think a bit must be said
emphasising the importance of
sport at IC. The majority of
people at IC are a member of a
sports club and so money given
to sporting purposes is well
distributed throughout the
College.
In more general terms last
year has had many important
implications for sport at IC. For
instance the approvement of the
