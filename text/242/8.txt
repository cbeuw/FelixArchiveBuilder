FELIX
The unlikely association of the Anglican Bishop of Montreal,
and a wild and rustic Presbyterian Scots fur trader led to the idea
in the nineteenth century of a University for Canada. The trader
was prevailed npon by the Bishop to found a universitv. On what
were then the outskirts of Montreal grew first a Medical School-
to be fo'Iowed bv the School of Arts and Science—a centre of
English learning in the heart of French speaking, but English
dominated, Quebec.
From these questionable begin-
nings, McGill has come to be
known as the 'Harvard of
Canada': a noble university to
which flock the sons and daughters
of well-off Quebec 'Anglais', res-
pectable people from the United
Kingdom who find it less embaras-
sing to go to McGill after failing
the Oxbridge entrance exams than
to a Redbrick, and a great number
of Americans seeking the education
of a private university at cut-rate
prices.

What is McGill like? There are
twelve thousand students crawling
about the tree^lined campus in
what is now the centre of Mont-
real. They can take degrees in any
subject imaginable and do grad-
uate work in most. A large percent-
age of the undergraduates are
commuters who appear at 9 a.m.
and can be seen fleeing the campus

FEES and
GOVERNMENT
The fees paid by undergraduates
and graduates alike are £210 which
covers about 30% of the total cost
of the education given. Thanks,
however, to the magnanimous
government of Quebec, in collabor-
ation with the University, all stud-
ents—Canadian, British and Amer-
ican—pay the same amount.
Some years ago, the Liberal
Government of Jean Lesage swept
to power in the province on a pro-
mise of, among other things, free
education. Unfortunately this
Utopian idea has yet to come to
pass. In fact in 1965 the fees were
inereased by £30.
The Canadian student in gener-
al, and the McGill student in
particular, is much more of a
political animal than we are here.
This was in evidence when the
fees were raised by the University
—five thousand students attended
a protest rally led by the student
government. A provincial Cabinet
member spoke to the angry
gathering and a massive 'sit-in'
took place, before a meeting of
the University Governors. The
fees went up !
McGill's position in Quebec is
a difficult one. It is the major
English speaking University in the
province arid is generally believed
to be well endowed. Thus the
provincial government is more in-
clined to aid the three French
speaking universities than McGill—
a situation which gives McGill a
feeling offinancialneurosis. Though
it does have a large endowment,
most of this is frozen by the origin-
al donors. Hence while there may
be a surfeit of scholarships avail-
able to the third illegitimate sons'
of immigrant white clergymen,
there is more than likely a lack of
money available to support scient-
ists. This conflictj—seen by some as
an attempt bv the English minor-
ity to bleed money from thei
French taxpayer for the running of
The Founders Tomb in front of the Arts Building
an English University—may result
in McGill's decline. It is too early,
however, to make any accurate
predictions.
STUDENT
GOVERNMENT
The students are an active
spirited lot, and student Conservat-
ive, Liberal, Communist and New
Democratic parties flourish. The
student government, though not
aligned to any party, is a
highly political organization, con-
cerned more with the issues that
affect students than with the run-
ning of clubs and dances.
The McGill government belongs
to the Canadian Union of Students
(C.U.S.) which is the voice on a
national scale of the 140,000 stud-
ents distributed from coast to
coast. Recently the Ganadian
student union shattered when the
French universities from Quebec
left C.U.S. to form the Union
Generate des Etudiahts de Quebec
—UGEQ. As education is strictly
a provincial matter in Canada it
was felt that a provincially
orientated Union could do more
for its members than a national
body.
For the better part of a year,
McGill was a member of both
UGEQ and CUS until right-wing
factions, centered on the Law and
Medical faculties and headed by a
former president, forced a refer-
endum. The result of the vote,
which had to be held twice amid
much bitterness, led to McGill's
withdrawal from UGEQ. This, most
probably, set Franco-English relat-
ions back to the days of Wolfe and
Montcalm.
The withdrawal from UGEQ by
popular vote showed the McGill
student to be a conservative beast
not prepared to accept the idea
of Student;, Syndicalism. The syndic-
alist believes that he is a young
intellectual worker—that his
natural alignment is with the
labour unions1
and farm move-
ments. This was too much for the
McGill student to swallow.
McGill would rather remain
the last fortress of English
enlightment in a Fiench province,
cut-off from the people of
the province whose taxes pay
for 70% of the McGillian's educat-
ion.
LADS ACTORS
and BEATS
With all of this political activity,
it is quite natural that most McGill
students are driven to drink and
in Montreal, the second largest
French speaking city in the world,
a drink is not hard to find. The
campus is just north of the city
centre and as there are no bars on
the campus students are forced to
migrate.
There are three major bars
frequented by three very different
groups. The Mansfield Tavern sells
cheap draught beer and is the
hangout of the fraternity type,
people between classes, and any-
