CHINA TODAY
O n e o p i n i o n
While I.C. wrangles about the Means Test for British students,
this test is accepted as necessary in Red China. Chinese students
are selected by a regional board and usually go to a University
in a different region from their home region. Most of the Univ-
ersities are almost wholly residential and prospective students
are permitted to state an order of preference but this usually
means that they do not get their first choke.
These are some of the aspects of Chinese life revealed in
some unedited films shown recently by Mr. Bill Bruggers of the
School of Oriental and Afr'can Studies. He had recently returned
from China with accounts of the current cultural revolution after
spending two years teaching English. Although the films were
unedited and Mr. Bruggers' answers were frank, his pro-Chinese
stance was easily detectable.
Ideology and politics are, as is
widely known, an integral part of
the Chinese life, but even science
and engineering students are sub-
jected to political theory and pro-
paganda during their courses.
Everyone is aware that West-
minster is an outpost of Capitol
Hill, that the Indians are Americ-
ans in disguise and that the Rus-
sians are now a very pale red as
a result of revisionist winds from
the West. Dickens -is the favour-
ite English author since it is in
'Dickensian England that] people
do not have enough to eat.
Cultural Revolution
On the cultural revolution, Mr.
Bruggers took the view that it is
not ,as frightening and disturbing
as the Press makes it out to be.
He sees it as an effort to slow
down the pace of the growth of
the bureaucratic machine. He as-
serts that the Chinese have come
to realise that the aim of ultimate
decentralisation, the; establisi'iimient
of 'actual Communism', cannot be
realised by increased initial cent-
ralisation and bureaucracy. This,
he thought, was the chief cause of
the cultural revolution, though big
head-hunting is its natural and
major by-product.
Red Guards
His films and comments made
it clear that the Red Guards are
not organised but are in fa«t a
result of spontaneous enthusiasm.
He thought that the Red Guard
rallies were treated by many as
a good chance to see Peking and
to generally 'nave fun'. The Red
Guard rally shown in the film was
of a 2± million strong march-past
lasting five hours, which took place
in Peking during the early days of
the cultural revolution. In this film
of the first few days of the cultur-
al revolution in Shanghai and
Peking one could see that the
Red Guards were all very happy
young people, not at all like the
image of the poker-laced blue-
overalled Chinese hordes that one
generally gets from press reports.
Breath-taking
A pleasant diversion was pro-
vided by one film showing the
varied landscape of China, some
views being as breath-taking as
those of the Grand Canyon. In
one of the more remote regibns he
claimed to have spent the night at
the foot of a huge statue in a
temple in the company of con-
templatives quite untouched by
the outside world. The people had
not come down from their high
abodes for eighteen years; Mao's
China has been there for seven-
teen.
On the whole it was very re-
freshing to hear the other point of
view on China and certainly one
emerged greatly enlightened by
Mr. Bruggers' instructive efforts.

BLOOD DONOR?
To say "Don't worry, there's
nothing to it", while true is not
much comfort as you will worry
about it. I know, I became a
donor last year. The 'nerves' were
by far tire worst part.
The things to remember are:—
to arrive on time, to do exactly as
you are told. They begin with
routine questions, etc. and ask if
you have had certain illnesses.
The next thing is a simple
blood test to see if anything is ob-
viously wrong, for instance ana-
emia. A more detailed test will
be carried out later. You then go
and lie down and the doctor
neatly slips a needle into your
arm. In my case it was in before
I knew what was happening.
Afterwards, you have a lie
down followed by" tea and biscuits.
Then you leave and carry on as
usual, I know of noone who suf-
fers any effects for any more
than an hour afterwards.
"We few, we happy few..." mus-
ed David Marquanrl, opening his
speech at the first IC Political Soc-
ieties leach-in of the term, "After
the Freeze". He might well have
inqant the audience, Which, to
give it the btnelt of the doubt,
numbered fifty. In fact he was
referring to himself, as the only
Labour speaker on a particularly
Labour issue. Fortunately the size
of the audience did not match the
skill of the speakers. These were
five, they were all good, and all
—including Marquand—were
quick to dissociate themselves at
least in part from the Govern-
ment's present policy.
Peter Besell, Liberal M.P. of
Bodmin opened the' meeting with
a lightening Liberal speech. He
considered the present situation
and future possibilities, and decid-
ed the whole policy was a mis-
take. What was needed was a
highly competitive economy, with
high wages, a new workers'
charter, and a breaking down of
the worker-manager barrier. It
was a scheme in the grand man-
ner, and he claimed that Roose-
velt had modelled the American
economy on this Liberal blueprint.
It is surprising Britain did not fol-
low suit.
For the Tories, Sir Keith Joseph
also castigated the Government.
The level of demand must be
kept in line with productivity; this
was not being achieved by the
present crash measures. A vigor-
ous economv was the thing, and
a constant flow of manpower from
one job to another, "an army of
temporarily unempVved", was
needed to lubricate this economy.

WATER SPORTS seem to
have become progressively
more- dangerous of late, and
I.C. are determined to keep in
the picture. The Boat Club are
trying hard and one Saturday,
not too long .ago, came the
first hint of success. In an at-
tempt by a novice eight, plus
For this high-handed attitude he
was roundly attacked by Arthur
Sier, the trade unionist of the
group. "I've been unemployed"
he said, "I know what it's like".
His was the most successful speech
of the evening ,in that he manay-
ed to ridicule everybody except
the British worker. The Army the
freeze, the stop-go policy, Wilson,
Callaghan, iSblwyn-Lloyd—aJJ)
came under the chopper. Even the
questioner who asked about over-
manning, underproduction and
restrictive practices was held up
as "right-wing, Tory, and naive,
knowing nothing of the real
world".
After such a biased speech it
was a relief to venture into ab-
struse economics with Dr. Brace-
well-Milnes, representing the
Confederation of British Industry.
Although he supported the
Government his support was only
half-hearted; this was clear even
to the layman. ',If Columbus had
spoken to you," commented
Marquand, "he would never have
dreamt of crossing the Atlantic."
Marquand advocated a moderate
thaw, a definite legal minimum
for wages, and a sensible workers'
charter. He stayed to face a bar-
rage of questions, and after this,
the meeting, which had been
chaired by Pete Ruhemann, clos-
ed. .
Why was the meeting so poorly
attended ? Andrew Jordan, Soc.
Soc. President, blames our old
friend, student political apathy,
and thinks that for this reason
future PolSoc teach-ins may have
to be shelved. In the meantime
two meetings are planned for the
term, one on Rhodesia, and one
to include Barbara Castle.

nasty incident occured. The

aground,—fortunately loss the
water was too shallow for the
boat to sink.
