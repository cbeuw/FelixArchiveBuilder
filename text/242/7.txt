Two large student bodies have
recently disaffiliated from N.U.S.;
the first was the Union of Keele
University which at the last
Council of N.U.S. in November
was defeated in its most recent
attempt to change the voting
system. Keele Union felt that it
could no longer stay in a Nation-
al Union whose Executive did not
represent its members.
Through the Multiple Transfer-
able Vote procedure which en-
ables the Executive of N.U.S. to
operate a 'ticket system' at elect-
ions, they are able to use the Union
machinery they control, to elect
then-
successors, and thus it is
impossible to change the make-up
of the Executive at elections.
Keele have sought for several
years to change to the Single
Transferable Vote but have been
unable to achieve the two-thirds
majority which is needed to
change the N.U.S. Constitution, al-
though a majority of the Unions
support the change.
John Harris, the President of
Keele Union, says "We do not
want to set up a rival organisat-
ion to the N.U.S., or to cause total
break-up of the National Union;
rather we wish to see it reformed
so that we can be members of a
National Union in which we
have some real faith".
Mr. Ian Wrigglesworth, a Vice-
President of N.U.S., said during a
visit to I.C. that N.U.S. would like
to refund the fees already paid by
Keele ,for membership but he
knew nothing definite.
The other unipn, which left on
January * 24th, is that of Salford
C.A.T,. 'soon to be a University.
The disaffiliation was caused by a
general reeling of dissatisfaction
iwtbin the running of N.U.S. but
specifically with the present in-
r-rnesp in the _ membership fee to
51- t>er capita.
C m COMPLAIN
A report appeared in BEACON
concerning the action of students
from Imperial during an abortive
attempt upon the Carrot. The
complaint levelled against the in-
surgents included the breaking of
windows, forcing doors, chains cut,
and the cutting of the public tele-
phone wires.
This report also demands that
I.C. should not be so hypocritical
over the timing of the removal of
Mike, as they claim that the Car-
rot was removed outside Union
hours in November 1965.
N.B. W.H.O. files report that Car-
rot was removed at 9.35 a.m. on
a Saturday morning, when the
then Northampton C.A.T. Union
was definitely open.

This year has seen a great ex-
pansion in the activities of the
Pt.C.S. Motor Club. From thei
jtart it was decided to absorb the
Pedal Car Club, start meetings
with films and lectures and start
either a go-kart section or a trials
car section. The latter was decid-
ed upon after investigations into
relative cost and members' opinions.
Following a talk by Mr. I lamia of
the 750 Motor Club it was decid-
ed to purchase a cur suitable for
trials under 750 Motor Club Rules
and Regulations. The Chairman
and Assistant Honorary Secretary
then proceeded to search for a
suitable vehicle—only to return
with a road racing 750 special.
This was, however, vaguely suit-
able for conversion to trials work
(after many weeks' work!). Last
Saturday morning saw several of
our driving members (and our
President—see photo) playing
Stirling Moss on the mud-covered
surface of Imperial Institute Road
—four wheel skids, handbrake
turns, the lot. As a result they now
want to leave it as it is and enter
it for Autocross—you just can't
win !
Meanwhile back at Jezebel's
garage, removal of the two engine
blocks had revealed that the un-
pleasant noise heard on the
London to Brighton Run was due
to shattered piston rings caused by
seized gudgeon pins. Although pro-
ceeding satisfactorily, thfe over-
haul will unfortunately not be com-
pleted in time for the demolition
of the existing garage and the
erection of a larger one.
Following the success of Jezette
in the Bristol National Pedal Car
Race last year, when she easily
won her class, the same car will
again be taken down this year,
with improved lighting, brakes etc.
For this year's race a system has
been devised in conjunction with
the Human Physiology Department
of University College for optimum
use of team capacity. This is con-
trolled by a team of co-ordinators
in the minivan connected to the
pits via a (fata link. Success is
jjuaranteed !
When the film "The Jokers" is
released be sure to see it, Jez
should be appearing for a short
time—doing her best to run over
Michael Crawford and Oliver
Reed in a Mini-Moke.
It also appears that colour photo-
graphs of Jez are now on general
sale in the form of postcards—price
5d each.
