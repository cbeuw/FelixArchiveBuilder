1 ne pancake f
Sir,
Civilisation in I.C. would take
a significant step forward if we
abandoned the perfectly barbaric
'tradition' of the Shrove Tuesday
pancake race. Exhilarating as it
mav be to stand illegally on the
Union roof and calculate the col-
lision time and course for illegal
fluid projectiles designed to meet,
at the level, of the Beit quad,
with our worthy executive, it is
quite inexcusable if it renders the
quad totally unusable by college
students and staff alike during a
peak hour of the day. Just as in-
excusable is the behaviour of the
'lion-fed Christians' in the quad
who, last year at any rate, not only
distributed 30 gallons of glutinous
pancake mixture with random liber-
ality over every available surface
but then omitted to have it re-
moved from the walls of Beit Hall
where it remained until the Main-
tainance Department removed it in
the summer vac.
If the Union executive wish to
demonstrate their awareness of the
forthcoming lent fast may I respect-
fully suggest that they substitute
for this farce the selling of pan-
cakes in the Union archway—all
proceeds to go to Carnival.

We need graduates in the sciences and the arts.
Scientists, mathematicians, engineers of all kinds
are required for research, design, development
and production—and with arts graduates they are
needed for the wide variety of computer appli-
cations to commerce, industry and science.
The GPO's new banking service, Giro, will use
several million pounds worthof System4computers,
but this is only part of the System 4 success
story. Government departments, local government
authorities, public utilities, banks, research estab-
lishments, educational establishments and many
commercial and industrial concerns at home and
abroad have also placed orders for System 4.
BAs, BScs, MAs, and PhDs . . . here is a career
opportunity with the fastest-growing company in
the computer industry which designs, manufac-
tures, applies and sells the most advanced com-
puters in the world. Opportunities exist in London,
Kidsgrove (North Staffordshire) and in provincial
centres.
Make arrangements through your Appointments
Board to meet representatives of EELM when they
visit your university. Meanwhile, write for our
booklet 'Careers in Computers', which gives
details of the openings in our organisation.

Sir,
May I through your columns
clear no a misunderstanding caus-
ed by the publication of a report
headed : "Kings are defeated in
first league game" in your issue
dated 18. 1. 67.
This report was placed next to
your soccer coverage on page 15
and, while certain clues were giv-
en in the report to indicate which
sport it referred to, a quick glance
at the headline and, indeed, the
report itself, led to many people
thinking that I.C. doubted K.C.L.'s
superiority in the realm of soccer.
The correct facts are that King's
1st soccer XI beat I.C. in a re-
cent league match by 2 goals to
0 and head the league with a 100%
record. They have also reached
the semi-finals of the U.L.U. Cup
which they won convincingly last
seasons
It would be an aid to your
readers, if, in future, it is made
clear to which sport a report re-
fers instead of merely giving the
reader 'clues' such as 'quarter',
'flick-on', and 'sent out.' I think
even your Sport's Editor would ad-
mit that the other descriptions in
the report could equally well ap-
ply to soccer and the fact that
the I.C. 1st XI does not have a
mention in the adjacent article
naturally leads to this doubt.
Meanwhile one must congratul-
ate I.C. water-polo team on then-
win although it is too early in the
season to be thinking of the
league title.
.Michael R. Senior, Sport's Editor'
Editorial Comment.
This unfortunate confusion arose
because a sub-headline was not
printed. This would have pointed
out that the article, in question,
concerned the I.C. v Kings water-
polo match. Did you notice the
error in the headline on page 14 ?

Demagogic C.N.D.
Malcolm Duckett, President of
the I.C. C.N.D. group and self-
styled Union Officer on Vietnam,
opened his much-vaunted, but
poorly attended, Extraordinary
General Meeting by lashing out
wildly in all directions.
He accused the Union Executive
failing to act on Vietnam out of
fear of loss of popularity and de-
plored the way they gave only
financial assistance towards a pub-
licity campaign on Vietnam. This
well-known, gingery speaker went
on to criticise the apathy of stud-
ents who were "to dam selfiish
to look away from their fat main-
tenance cheques and pints of beer".
He called on the members of staff
to give "moral" guidance ns well
as teaching during their lectures
by following the Americans' ex-
ample of making comment on
Vietnam while lecturing. Leaving
no stone unturned, he also attack-
ed FELIX for accepting advertis-
ments from the U.K.A.E.A.
Mr. Duckett then made a long
statement on the morality of cert-
ain scientists. He referred to those
who "took the wrong hirriing" by
engaging in weapon research, and
questioned whether they should be
allowed to control the direction of
scientific research.
No change of
name
It was decided not. to change
the name of the society to bring
any reference to Vietnam in the
naine as it would mean further
changes when peace was achieved.
On Vietnam it was decided, after
a rambling discussion on the histor-
ic validity and legality of the
Vietnam governments which re-
minded unresolved, that the policy
of the I.C.C.N.D. should be to
support a return to the 1954 Agree-
ment.
Resolved to
oppose
It was not until the questions
of a photo display that might be
held at I.C. and the Orphans in
Vietnam Fund had been discussed
that the new Rector, Sir William
Penney, was mentioned. There were
calls for a vote of no confidence,
bu'j Pete Ruhemann called for this
to be kept for a more opportune
moment. Bob Orr called for the
same delay, but expressed a point
of view that seemed to coincide
with that of the old ladies knit-
ting by the guillotine. Mr.
Boothman presented a motion re-
gretting the appointment of Sir
William Penney which Mr.
Ruhemann countered with a some-
what more general resolution. In
a fine spirit of compromise, both
the motions were carried. Mr.
Boothman's resolution read: "We
regret the appointment as Rector
of a man Who has by his work
on nuclear weapons not come up
to the social and moral responsibil-
ities that we believe society should
demand of scientists". Mr. Ruhe-
mann's counter-resolution read:
"I.C.C.N.D. believe that scientists
should show moral and social res-
ponsibility towards society in their
choice of employment and research;
and will campaign to bring this
question to the attention of stud-
ents at I.C."

Soon seven R.C.S. students will
be appearing before two to three
million viewers on American Tele-
vision. These students took part
in feasting and drinking scenes
filmed in the Elizabethan Rooms,
Queen's Gate for KCRA News, a
Galifornian television network, as
part of a series of ten five-minute
ews features on British traditional
institutions.
The students became involved
when two of their number, D.
Brock and R. Bass, were accosted
in Prince Consort Road by repre-
sentatives of the British Travel As-
sociation and offered free drink to
appear as extras in a film. In
order to raise the required number
of extras, they enquired in the
Physics library, where the indicat-
ion of free alcohol soon raised a
reasonable number, who then spent
an hour being filmed drinking.
As can be imagined, little work
was done in the Physics library
that afternoon after the sbidents
had returned.
