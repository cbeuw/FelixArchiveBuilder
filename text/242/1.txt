Busy meeting
adjourned
by D. SULLIVAN
Thanks to the skill of president Touy Duke, the recent union
meeting was able to cover a large amount of work despite the
widespread disinterest in it Quorum was finally achieved in the
first meeting after more than half the business had been complet-
ed. The number of motions to be covered and the newly introdnc-
ed question-time necessitated the meeting being adjourned to the
following Thursday.
The report on the means test,
which was commissioned last June
during the debate oil the loans
lobby, was piesentod', by Pete-
Finch, the Welfare ©racer. His
figures were based on' a question-
aire distributed last term—•most of
the 107 peoples came from the
Physics dept. Very few conclus-
ions emerged from the disinterest-
ed presentation except that 7/2%
of students at IC receive less than
£330 p.a. compared to the re-
commended £370. A motion,
down for debate later in the meet-
ing, to set up a committee to
look into this, was mentioned.

Sir William Penney, upon tak-
ing up his appointment as Rector
in October, can be expected to
impart to the college a great deal
of his drive and enthusiasm, and
to bring the constituent parts of
the college more closely together.
It is thought that he will fake a
considerable inte\)st iini student
affairs as he will in everything
that goes on in the college. Lady
Penney can also be expected to con-
tribute a great deal to the social
activities of the college. Sir
William is' a likeable and friendly
person and has been held in great
respect by everyone who has
worked with him.
A member of the Physics De-
partment who worked under him
at the Atomic Weapons Research
Establishment ad Aldermaston
says that, when he left, the place
seemed to lose a sense of purpose
and direction. His large capacity
for oiganisation and co-ordination
helped to build up A.W.R.E.; Im-
perial College can be expected to
benefit greatly from this.

Question time
The problem of student park-
ing was the subject of a question
answered by Brendan Parker, ICU
secretary. He reported that at-
tempts had been made to obtain
concessions, \ including Resident
staus for all members of the col-
lege. However the Kensington &
Chelsea Council have, as yet, no
definite plans for the area and so
no rulings can be given. It seems
likely, however, that Imperial
Istitute road will be closed to
students—under Sir Patrick
Linstead it was a "first come, first
serve" area. Brendan maintained
that the Union had been allotted
a few reserved parking spaces; any
one with a special need for a car
should apply to him.
Mr Jordan was assured by
Tony Duke that he could inspect
the council minutes in the Union
office; and reminded that constitu-
ent college representatives and
two FELIX reporters were pre-
sent at each meeting.
The meeting had now reached
quaracy and the minutes were
signed.
I C S A S A F
The first motion, to set up a
fund of £2000 to educate a South
African Student who, because of
the colour of his skin, would not
otherwise receive an fC university
education, was proposed by Mr
Garga, an impassioned and well-
informed speaker. There was lit-
tle discussion from the floor and
none on where the money was to
come from. Mr Colin Stuart
qnestioned some of Mr Garga's
facts but the feeling of the meet-
ing was in favour of the motion,
which 'wias carried overwhelming-
ly. The task of raising the money
was left to Andy Jordan and Mr
Bellchambers.
The meeting then moved on to
an Executive Motion, proposed by
Mr Brendan Parker, to the effect
that it deplored the Govern-
ment's move to raise fees for
foreign students. Mr Parker's pro-
posal speech, was, in fact, quot-
ations from various letters to
"The Times" and a letter from
Mr McDowall. He also made the
point that the motion was really
concerned with students from un-
derdeveloped countries—not, say,
from the USA.
This motion, also, was carried
by the somewhat smug meeting.
The meeting being inquorate
Mr Fuchs moved an adjournment
and accepted Tony Duke's sug-
gestion of Thursday. He also
pleaded for publicity for the ad-
journed meeting.
When the meeting opened on
Thursday some 60 people were
present. The remaining motion,
concerning tire means test and
proposed by Frank Fuchs, could
not therefore be debated. Mr
Reich now stood, and said that
quality, not quantity, was what
counted and so the motion should
continue. At this point Ray
Phillips, ACC Chairman, sprang
to his feet to propose that Mr
Reich therefore be asked to leave,
this motion being carried un-
animously.
Tony Duke then expressed the
Executive's disapproval of IC's
vandalism ;vt other collegs and in-
formed the meeSng of the loutish
behaviour reported by City Univ-
ersity. He also requested better
behaviour in the Southside bar.
Mr Boothman raised the matter
of IC representation at a lobby
organised by RSA on the subject
of overseas students* fees. He, Mr
Cavanagh and Mr Nirfm Som
were duly elected as representat-
ives, after Tony Duke had ascert-
ained that Mr Bootliman was pre-
sent.
Andy Jordan suggested that, due
to the large ammoimt of outstand-
ing business, the next Union meet-
ing be held in three rather than
six weeks. The Executive agreed
to consider this and they later de-
cided to hold one on Tuesday 2fst
February.
