1 am reterring to that despicable
incident, which overran the bounds
or decency, and concerns the
GPO Tower. Already many un-
suspecting members ot the public
have been directly affected, ridic-
uled, even savaged, as a result of
this invisible danger to human
well-being.
The sparrows, which now roost
on top of this monumental hazard,
have been observed closely by
several distinguished ornithologists.
Many are staking their reputations
on a theory, worked out with the
co-operation of that famous
phyicist McGooo of McGoon,
on a general theory of levitation;
each night in the interests of
science tney undergo ridicule from
their wives. (Not McGoon of
McGooii; his harem is too well
behaved). What is more, one bird
spotter had to be put away be-
cause the sight of a sleeping
pigeon disturbed him. If he had
sat still like the sparrows it would
have been all right, but this pigeon
slept whilst missing a glorious
panoramic view as he was rotated
every half hour, while supposedly
he should have been eating his
bird-seed (at highly exorbitant
prices). In this way the W.H.O. are
directly responsible for burdening
the English asylum with another
incurable, wasting valuable straw
space, and misusing the precious
time of England's already over-
worked hospital zoo.
My final contention is also one
of a highly frustrating nature.
Nymphomaniacs (Latin for tele-
phone operators) keep saying
delightful things in my ear, but
all I sense are voices (such are the
powers of RAPE). Even if I knew
roughly where these voices were, I
still would have great difficulty in
pinning them down, so could
someone possibly de-RAPE them.

Sir,
We, being members of the
above mentioned Union (Northern
Polytechnic & National College of
Rubber Technology Students
Union) are perturbed about the
gross misrepresentation of the
facts pertaining to the removal of
our "Tatty Tapir' as reported in
your organ. Those responsible for
its abduction have, to our dismay,
taken great pains to make it ap-
pear that our mascot was removed
during Union hours. To this end,
they produced a photograph show-
ing the completion of the raid at
one minute past nine our time,
but which they claimed was two
minutes behind G.M.T.
As our Union opens at 9.00 a.m.,
do they .seriously maintain that
they entered the building, climbed
onto the first floor, cut through the
'case hardened steel chains' and
removed said mascot to the street
in 3 minutes ? If this were true
then we congratulate them on
their efficiency.
However, certain facts remain:—
1. The raiders were challenged by
a porter inside the closed gates of
the college on or about 8.30 am.
2. When our Secretary arrived at
9.00 am., she was told by a mem-
ber of the cleaning staff that the
mascot had gone. Immediate in-
spection proved this to be so.
According to Page 3 of 'Sennet'
(January 17th, 1967), your college
have made a terrible fuss about
the removal of MIKE outside
Union hours and are considering
taking legal action. Surely this re-
presents hypocrisy of the highest
order ? And how would I.C. feel
if we were to consider legal action.
We would very much like this
letter to be published since we
are sure that your paper, as do
most others, wishes to give a true
representation of the facts.
B.J. Bull
Vice-President of Internal Affairs
Sir,
In reply to Mr. Bull's letter I
would like to make the following
points :—•
1. The 'raiders' that the porter
challenged were, in fact, merely
the advance party that went in tc
make sure that the Tatty Tapir
was there to be removed. The
main party went in via another
(open) door about 15 minutes later.
2. Just because the Secretary did
not see the mascot in its usual
place at 9.00 a.m. was no reason
to assume that it was no longer
on Union property—which is what
matters for it can be no offence
to move a mascot from one part
of the Union to another. Had she
had the sense to execute an im-
mediate search of the area near
the emergency exit from the
lounge in which the Tapir was
•kept she would have found the
raiders and the Tapir quite easily.
I state again that not only were
their clocks slow but disagreed
with one another and that Horace
was moved at two minutes past
nine G.M.T.
The promise made to me by, I
think, their President, to follow up
the clues and pay a sum of money
to our Gharity Carnival at the-
end, has not yet, to the best of
my knowledge, been kept.

Sir,
I hear that the Bishop of Bath
and Wells, together with three
M.P.'s, has formed SPUNCLE; the
Society for the Protection of UN-
born Children, to oppose the latest
Parliamentary Bill intended, to re-
form the laws on abortion. The
idea that a fertilised human ovum
possesses some spiritual property
(usually called a soul) which the
sperm and ovum separately do not
possess, seems to me so fatuous that
I don't see how any rational pers-
on could sincerely affirm it.
I would like, therefore, to point
out to these sincere and rational
people, that their society is not
basic enough, and to invite them
to help me form SPASM; the Soc-
iety for the Protection of ovA and
SperM. This Society would camp-
aign for the introduction of life
sentences for homosexuals, lesbians,
users of non-hormonal contracept-
ives, masturbators and abortionists;
compulsory marriage at puberty for
every male; compulsory use of the
Pill (it stops - ovulation) by all un-
married females and compulsory use
of Thalidomide by all married
women. (Perhaps you didn't know
that Thalidomide doesn't itself de-
form a foetus, but suppresses the
normal destruction of a deformed
foetus by the womb).
There will still be problems of
course, like the fact that concept-
ion is a hit-or-miss process, and
that there are millions of sperm for
every ovum, but at least every
sperm and ovum will have a sport-
ing chance of meeting their counter-
parts.
1 just hope that the men from
SPUNCLE have an answer to the
Population Explosion.
In last weeks hitter, a phrase
three-quarters of the way down the
column should have read: "...and
chunks of a course being cut out
of an exam syllabus without any-
one being (officially) told."
The author is not responsible for
most of the punctuation errors, or
for any of the spelling mistakes.
I actually liked the Union Meet-
ing a la Duke. For a change I
got the impression that the Execut-
ive was there in order to do some-
thing. Keep it up.
Wish I could stop worrying
about those two £100 candelabra,
though. I'm not really worried
about the flippant way in which
we are told that one of the Union
candelabras had got broken, was
taken to some department to be
repaired and then disappeared.
After all, who cares about £100 ?
It's the precedent that worries me.
Why were two placed on order
when onlv one disappeared ? Now
that MIKE has gone AWOL, are
we going to have to make two
more of him ? What would hap-
pen if Tony Duke were kidnapped?
I'd also be interested to know
whether the police have been in-
formed, and if so, with what re-
sult ? Were the candelabra insur-
ed, and if not. why not? And of
course, can't the Refectory Com-
mittee find anvthine more worth-
while to spend £200 on; like im-
proving the refectories, or contribut-
ing to Andy Jordan's SASF ?
Talkipt of SASF, was it reason-
ing or feelings of guilt that made
the Union support it ? I am
rather incredulous of the argument
that an I.C.-educated student will
be just what the black South
Africans need when the "crunch"
comes. Judging by events in the
Congo, Nigeria, Ghana, and
Rhodesia, a politician-cum-soldier
would be of rather more use. But
I still support the gesture. I hope
that no one has any illusions about
it being more than just that.
Now that cultural relations are
about to begin with N . Vietnam,
how about trying to exchange
some I.C. students for Vietcong ?
Think of the attractions; sniping
at Americans, and torturing and
murdering harmless civilians. In re-
turn, we could teach the Vietcong
to play cricket, Tr Poohsticks, or
something. Stand by for a full-
page advert in FELIX : "SUPPORT
HO CHI MINH."

C r o s l a n d ' s
n o n s e n s e
Sirs,
On Tuesdav, 17th January, Mr
Crosland made two points in his
defence of the move to direct the
Universities to compulsorily in-
crease the fees of overseas students
from the present £85 to £250. The
first was that the Government will
still be subsidising the fees to the
same extent as they did five years
ago. The second is that the stud-
ents whom this scheme is supposed
to affect are those from the United
States and th« White Domiuion
couiicries. i n coiijunCLion witn me
second pome lie stated that the
Government will De aiding
governments " ot underdeveloped
countries who' sponsored students
v.ui oe altucted oy such a scheme
negarduig the nrst poult, what Mi
Crosiand said is sheer nonsense
it is true that the cost ot living
has gone up since five years ago,
but it certainly has not gone up
by 300% as an increase from £85
to iJZoO, with the Government still
subsidising co tile same extent,
would imply.
Coming to the second point, Mr
Crosland himself admitted that
this move is unpopular, and will
also cause a lot of hardships for
individual students from the de-
veloping countries. A mere admis-
sion is not enough. If the scheme
is supposed to be aimed at stud-
ents from the US and the Dominion
countries, then why not limit the
increase to these students alone :
Why should the students from the
Commonwealth and other develop-
ing countries be hit as well i It
is no good refunding the increas-
es to those Commonwealth Govern-
ments whose scholarships students
will be hit. The proportion of
overseas students who are on their
governments' grant is very small.
Many of us pay our way through
University. Such an increase of
fees will therefore hit those of us
who least deserve it and who can
least afford it. May I also point
out that the money that would ac-
crue from us will do the country
little good as this will only cover
a negligible percentage of the educ-
ation bill.
