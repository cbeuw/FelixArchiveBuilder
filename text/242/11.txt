John Taylor, son of a bishop and
himself a distinguished Christian
minister. He was educated both at
Cambridge—Trinity—and at Oxford
—Wycliffe Hall, where he trained
for the ministry. His life has been
spent in nearly every continent
where he has been involved, at
grass roots level, with the detail-
ed life of the church and her re-
levant 'image'. H e has a special
interest in Africa, and has written
acutely and imaginatively about
religious aspirations in that vast
continent. He sees the Presence of
Christ not merely in the Christian
churches, but also far beyond the
bounds of Christendom.
He will bring with him in his
'team' a host of helpers. They will
include teachers, an architect,
clergy, nuns, a drama specialist,
ordinary nonprofessional Christian
men and women. They will be
among us during the 'Week' and
some 200 of us are acting as
"hosts' to them in providing meals,
coffee parties etc. Maybe YOU
have already very kindly consented
to be a fiost'. if you have, then
please get along your friends-be-
lievers, don't knows etc—and see
that they meet your 'guest' over a
cup of coffee during this great
week.
WHAT and WHY
Your rather slick fifth form
science master might have given
you the impression that intelligent
SCIENCE students don't waste
time and trouble over God and
matters of faith. Some of you
might still be suffering from this
deceptive delusion. A TEACHING
WEEK is exactly what it says. It
is an opportunity to present intel-
ligently, dynamically and with
strong conviction the essential
truths—called the Gospel—held by
Christian men and women.
The Gospel is concerned about
this world, this earth, this age of
technology, this college of science.
It is riot the possession of merely
the very devout and the very pious.
It is not the hobby if the inade-
quate and stultified person, who
has nothing better to do with his
spare time. It is rather, the dynam-
ic, the pulsating, quickening and
life generating heartbeat of the
young, intelligent man or woman
who wants to live life and live it
fully.
The Gospel has more to do with
Biology, than with Bach; more
with Technology than with
trumpets.
