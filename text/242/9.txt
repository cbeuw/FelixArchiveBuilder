one in need of a quick drink
between 8 a.m. and midnight. The
Cafe Andre is the home of the
acting type, the English depart-
ment and anyone in need of a four
o'clock martini. The third es-
tablishment, and by far the best,
is the Swiss Hut—filled round the
clock with anarchists, separatists,
communists, prostitutes, drug ad-
dicts and, of course, drunks.
The Swiss Hut offers a liberal
education rivalling that of most
universities, and all for the price
of a bottle of beer. It is regrett-
able that most McGill students do
not discover it until they are
graduate students.
In any serious essay on McGill
the fraternities should be mention-
ed. They exist and in their well
worked out social structure, you
find gieat numbers of jolly, beer-
drinking chaps. The fraternity
houses specialise in various aspects
of campus life. Those that have
control of the student government,
are known as 'respectable houses;
those that excell in fornication are
referred to, and I suspect enviously,
as animal houses'
It is difficult to communicate
what McGill is, what the atmo-
sphere is and how alive it is. It
is impossible to get through the
day without at least one debate
on the student's role in the univers-
ity, commitment to education, or
>
n what is going on at Berkeley
it is impossible to stroll across the
campus without encountering
charming females, or perhaps a
group of people listening to an
irate student sublimating on his
soapbox.
The student government, be it
right or left wing, is the constant
victim of the McGill Daily, and
the editor of the Daily is ever on
the verge of being fired for being
a communist, or irresponsible, or
something.
There is the conservative and
scholarly side. Stephen Seacock
was a McGill professor and had
Rutherford stopped on his way to
Cambridge. James McGill, the
founder, is buried in front of the
Arts building. McGill has a long
history of producing great Canadi-
ans and will probably go on doing
so no matter what it, or the
government, does to stop it.
Among the many guests at

-
