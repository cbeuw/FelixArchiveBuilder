The development of "WETORDRY" paper in 1921
represented a major breakthrough in the fortunes of
3M Company. This single product played a significant
role in the progress of the automobile industry. Today,
the Company produces hundreds of coated abrasives
developed from the original "WETORDRY"
Just one example of the dramatic story of progress
and expansion attributable to this dynamic inter-
national organisation making over 37,000 quality
products. 3M also have a world-wide reputation for
the manufacture of "Scotch" tapes. Now there are
over 300 tapes made from plastic, acetate, cellulose
paper and foil for every type of industrial and com-
mercial application. Other 3M products are adhesives,
coatings and sealers ; business equipment machines
and systems; reflective and printing products;
magnetic tapes; fluorochemicals and photographic
products.
Extensive research leading to continued expansion
and development will create opportunities for
graduates in Science, Engineering, Arts and other
disciplines, to train for positions of responsibility and
challenge. The only limiting factors in the graduate's
progress with 3M are of his own making. An able
man with diligence and initiative can expect to
advance fast.
