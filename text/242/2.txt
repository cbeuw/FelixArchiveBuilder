In an attempt to sort out facts
from opinions on the- vexing sub-
ject of the ref...lories, a survey
is being carried out by D. Harris,
Chairman oi R.C.C. It is being
run from SOth January to 3rd.
February and is being carried out
in the Union Lower Refectory.
The survey is being conducted
with a detailed questionnaire which,
it is hoped, everyone will fill in
after each meal.
Geheral conclusions will be
drawn from the complete volume
of -completed questionnaires, whilst
a smaller sample will be examin-
ed in detail. A major item of in-
terest is to determine prefer-
ence of students foi various
styles of cooking. Mister Harris,
a self-confessed refectory us-
er, hopes to make a pre-
liminary report to the Union
Council as soon as possible. There
Is a chance that the survey may
be repeated in other refectories
later if it is thought this may he
of value.

This term's season of Southside
Stomps began magnificently with
Spencer's Washboard Kings. These
seven gentlemen form a "sort of"
Trad Baud and performed a larj,e
repertoire of numbers, punctuated
by numerous special effects, rang-
ing from pistol shots and smoke
bombs to dismantling the clarinet
whilst playing it.
They were very well received by
the enthusiastic audience, and suc-
ceeded in stopping the dancing for
the last half-hour as people crowd-
ed round to watch.
Although the audience was
good for the first stomp of the
term, one could perhaps have hop-
ed for a larger audience for such
a well-known group.

A series of articles appeared in
the "Guardian' last summer de-
scribing the plight of the civilians
in Vietnam. Martha Gellhorn, who
wrote the articles, described part-
icularly the miseries of those
children orphaned by war. The
number of orphans in Vietnam ris-
es steeply every day. In Saigon
alone there are ten overcrowded
orphanages, and many more
throughout the rest of Vietnam, in
the North and South. The South
Vietnamese Government pays 12
piastres a day for each child,
which does not prevent general
starvation. Medical care, occupat?
ional therapy, any amusement are
not even dreamed of: hunger
rules.
As a consequence of these art-
icles, a Vietnam Orphans Fund
was set up by Professor Brent of
Southampton University and
others from British Universities.
Already many universities have
contributed, and the fund has
reached £7,000. The money is
then distributed to orphanages .in
both North and South Vietnam by
Oxfam and Red Cross.
A committee has now been
formed at I.C. to raise a collect-
ion from staff and students here.
We hope to approach everyone in-
dividually within a few days and
ask for a contribution. Please help
to give these children a future by
giving as much as you can afford.
Further details can be obtained
from Paul Rogers and Ian Smith
in Botany. It is also probable that
copies of the original Guardian
articles will be placed on depart-
mental notice-boards.

In view of the RCS representat-
ion at the RSA conference on
Saturday 28 January we are publ-
ishing some notes on the RSA
policies. Their hand-out sets out
"what we believe to be a pro-
gramme necessary for the interests
of students for the removal of
barriers to a full and democratic
education, and for the greatest
contribution of students to society
and social progress" etc. etc. The
leaflet contains statements^ on vari-
ous aims of the alliance—some of
which seem rather obvious, for
example, "Students should have
the right to complete control over
their own unions and funds,
without interference, to elect their
own officers and determine their
own policies". Other statements
tend to be rather sweeping—
"Education must be classless, in-
tegrated, (not tripartite or binary)
and comprehensive at all levels"
—does this Kapply to University
level as wellV Another mystifying
demand was that "college authorit-
ies should be more democratically
composed to include representat-
ives of students, non-professorial
staff and trade unions". Students
on academic sub-committees, all
right, but surely not on college
authorities (whatever that actually
means—it certainly implies a per-
manent institution in which the
average transitory student would
be worse than useless). And what
exactly would trade unions do ?
Politically
concerned
In tact the whole tone of the
document seems to suggest a
greater concern with politics than
with student affairs. Later referenc-
es imply that the Alliance is critic-
al of the lack of effectiveness of
the National Union of Students
(this opinion is shared by many
other people, but in fact the
Union does a lot of useful work).
According to Ian Wrigglesworth, a
vice-president of NUS, it is splinter
groups like RSA that have damag-
ed- the reputation of NUS sever-
ely—mainly of course because of
their extreme left-wing supporters.
