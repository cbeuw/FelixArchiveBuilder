Imperial College Men’s 1st XV got off
to a good start to the new season with
a win against King’s Medicals (Guy’s,
King’s and St. Thomas’).
The game started with an electrify-
ing pace with Imperial getting an early
penalty that was comfortably con-
verted by Kieran Burg, to give Impe-
rial an early three point lead. This only
seemed to fuel King’s Medicals as they
increased the intensity and they started
to dominate in the forwards, often giv-
ing the Imperial forwards a lot of grief
in the scrums.
Imperial, however, were very quick
to pounce on any mistakes that King’s
Medicals made, with captain Andrew
Jasudasen scooping up a loose lineout
ball in the oppositions 5 meter line and
scoring a try. The conversion was un-
successful. Imperial led 8 – 0.
Again King’s Medicals increased the
pressure, with a lot of flowing rugby
from their backs, often breaking the
Imperial defensive line. After some
sustained pressure, King’s Medicals
were finally rewarded with a penalty,
which was converted, leaving the score
at 8 – 3. The opposition’s forwards kept
maintaining the pressure on the Impe-
rial pack, both in the scrum and in the
line-outs, which gave an excellent plat-
form for their backs to run. If it wasn’t
for a try-saving tackle by Alex John-

stone in the corner, the medics could
have gone into the lead at half time.
After some serious contemplation at
half time from the captain and coach,
the side went into the second half feel-
ing as if they had something to prove.
This was immediately seen from the
forwards, where they finally retaliated
to the onslaught from the opposition
by winning their own scrum and se-
verely distrupting the King’s Medicals
ones. But the surge didn’t stop there,
with the forwards running some great
attacking, powerful runs through the
centre, predominantly from the props
Jovan Nedić and fresher Terry Addo.
The forwards were then shown to be
extremely versatile with vice-captain
and flanker Flannan O’Mahony show-
ing his kicking skills by setting up a
nice chip and chase, only to be foiled
by the rest of the pack who were too
bemused by what was happening in
front of them.
The 20 minutes of sustained pres-
sure from the Imperial forwards gave
an excellent platform for their backs
to show their magic, and it was clearly
something that King’s Medicals could
not cope with as their scrum half was
sin-binned for a late tackle on the fly-
half. Imperial took advantage of the
extra man and after breaking through
the middle of the field, the ball was
eventually off loaded to Tom Carroll
who scored a try giving Imperial a 13
– 3 victory.
Man of the match went to Jovan
Nedić for the constant barrage of runs
to the King’s Medicals line, and Twat of
the Match went to James Fletcher for a
cross-field kick that landed neatly into
the oppositions wingers hands.
Although a victory, there is clearly a
lot of room for improvement, especial-
ly in terms of line-outs, if the side ever
expect to win the league. Hopefully
this will be noticeable next week.
