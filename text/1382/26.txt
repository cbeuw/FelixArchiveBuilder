Championship Gaming Series: The UK Finals
Sebastian Nordgren
I
n a move that put the cart before
the horse, SkyOne’s Champion-
ship Gaming Series Finals em-
phasized television broadcast-
ing quality over the purity of
the competition and the gamers them-
selves. In the recent CGS UK finals at
3 Mills Studios in Bromley, there was
a lot of talk about atmosphere, glam-
our and excite-
ment, but little to
no quality gaming.
Despite the abun-
dance of talent
present in the stu-
dio, spread across
4 different games,
with nearly all of
the UK’s best play-
ers present at the
event, the CGS’s
pared-down rules
and TV-friendly
format compro-
mised the prin-
ciples of fair play
and proving, be-
yond any reasona-
ble doubt, that the
winner deserved
to win.
With an impressive studio setup;
good hosts (MTV’s Emma Griffiths
and Dave Berry); a decent-sized audi-
ence for the remote location; a great
commentating team (gaming com-
mentating stalwart ReDeYe, Quake 4
professional 2GD and a few of Sky’s
own professional sports commenta-
tors); and even glamour model Keeley
Hazell acting as ring-side girl, I expect-
ed the CGS to impress me more than
any of the other tournaments I had
attended in the past. However, after
an hour’s wait, my expectations were
shattered as the evening’s first contest-
ants stepped up to the Xboxes, mount-
ed on lit podiums front and centre, to
play FIFA07. Then they walked back
and sat down again. And again, until fi-
nally the producers were happy. Keeley
Hazell stepped up, asked the contest-
ants if they were ready and then blew
a whistle – applause was cued and the
audience went wild.
My soul sank as I realized that this
wasn’t competitive gaming as I knew it.
There was no soul to the pro-
ceedings; it was all optimized
for normal punters who couldn’t tell
Halo apart from Counter-Strike. The
FIFA match was over in 5 minutes –
no best-of-3 was played as is usual for
the game, and the time limit was half
of what it usually is. ChrisyB had won,
Bazza looked disappointed, but they
were given a cursory interview and
then ushered off.
The day continued in much the same
pattern, with gamers being brought
up and with their duties performed,
shown the door. The producers reigned
supreme here, with rules arbitrarily
changed for better watchability, with
utter disregard for the fairness of the
proceedings towards the gamers. They
were all here for a shot at a profession-
al contract – being paid a salary for
playing games, what more could you
want? But simultaneously, they looked
dismayed that these were the circum-
stances – where luck and a guy behind
the camera had more to do with suc-
cess than actual skill.
Withallthefinalshavingbeenplayed,
with mostly predictable results, the
draft was to follow, but the audience
was tired, hungry and thirsty, having
sat in the studio without any breaks
for 3 hours. A short break was called,
and the atmosphere was restored go-
ing into the draft. This was the main
event of the evening, where 20 play-
ers were to earn a spot on one or the
other of the teams – the Birmingham
Salvo or the London Mint – and a con-
tract. Sujoy Roy, the London team’s
manager and founder of ESReality.com
and Omega Sektor LAN centre in Bir-
mingham, had the first pick and chose
ChrisyB, the UK’s premier FIFA player.
Michael O’Dell, manager of both Salvo
and the dignitas professional gaming
team, then made 2 choices, and so it
continued, back and forth, each man-
ager getting 2 picks each turn, until 20
players had been drafted – 5 for Coun-
ter-Strike Source, 2 for Project Goth-
am Racing 3, 1 for FIFA 2007, 1 male
and 1 female Dead or Alive 4 player for
each team.
This was supposed to be a rivalry,
but with shooting time limited, the
match-up between Salvo and Mint was
the next day, bringing into question the
idea of there being a significant
team element to the proceedings.
Mostly, the UK team final would be a
repeat of yesterday’s matches, since
with few exceptions the players in the
individual finals had been drafted. The
repeated match-ups all produced pre-
dictable results – essentially repeats of
the previous day’s bouts, but the FIFA
match turned out to be a thriller. With
underdog Bazza taking an unexpected
lead against strong favourite ChrisyB
late into the game, only to be tied up
in the very last seconds, and then los-
ing in a penalty shootout, this was true
competition. Individual men’s DOA4
champion Messy ended up being de-
feated by long-time rival Padaman,
leaving Birmingham Salvo in dire
straits, requiring their Counter-Strike
squad to win by absolute blow-out for
Salvo to come out overall champions.
Unfortunately, Mint squad 4Kings
had been underperforming all week
and had finally found their stride – and
with the whole audience’s loud support,
they stormed on to an early lead, which
they then held until the end, leaving
Birmingham Salvo devastated. Overall
team scores: 31-
19 in favour of
the Mint.
While it’s hard
to argue that the
event was a fail-
ure, its successes
had little to do
with the hosts or
“cyber babe” Kee-
ley, nor with the
rehashed rule set,
but everything
to do with actual
excitement about
the results.
The gaming
was exciting,
and the ooh’s
and aah’s during
matches were
real, not cued by a guy with a headset.
The question that needs answering if
the Championship Gaming Series is to
continue is not “how do we make this
event more spectacular?” but “aren’t
we forgetting the games?”. With events
like QuakeCon, the Electronic Sports
World Cup and the Cyberathlete Pro-
fessional League all drawing large
numbers of spectators without resort-
ing to TV antics and faked applause,
the CGS is approaching the sport from
the wrong angle. A free piece of advice
for the executives at the CGS – make
the gaming exciting and the spectators
will follow.
Bloxorz are teh roxxorz
Azfarul Islam
Trying to match a peg to the correctly
shaped hole was probably a harrow-
ing experience as a toddler unless you
were a prodigal wunderkind, or just
plain lucky. Bloxorz channels the spirit
of this noble task of old but with myri-
ad spicy twists.
The objective is to manipulate a
standard oblong block such that it gen-
tly falls through a conveniently placed
hole. Note the word ‘conveniently’. The
crux of the challenge lies in actually
transporting the block itself; there are
obstacles and impediments abound.
This requires a good deal of spatial
awareness and perception, although
random luck (as before) can work
miracles sometimes. A combination of
switches, bridges and other wondrous
devices including the fact that you can
fall off the edge all too easily are there
to stay your progress. It can get quite
addicting as you try to figure out the
correct path for each stage – madden-
ingly, there can be quite a few. This is
easily the kind of game that you’ll relish
in replays and particularly have a blast
with when solving with friends.
