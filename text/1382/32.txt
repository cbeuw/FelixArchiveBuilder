Virgo
So far, you’ve man-
aged to write two
entries into your
self-referential jour-
nal. They’re not the
most enthralling and
they’re probably not going to garner you any
awards. In all honesty, you wish some other
fucker would write your journal for you. As
the anger swells within you, you brutally slain
your fellow office workers. And relax.
Scorpio
Someone refers
to something you
say as what “they”
say. You know, like
in the grandest,
yet vaguest way.
That vague way in which people refer to a
statement they’ve just made up in their head
and need to qualify it... “They reckon bird flu
be spreading.” That kind of thing. WHO ARE
THEY?! WHAT IS THIS BOX I’M IN?!
Libra
This week little red
men start crawl-
ing all over your
skin. The Political
Correctness Polic-
ing Unit become
enraged with you: “little red men?!”. You can’t
quite believe your luck. The little red men are
far nicer than any green ones have ever been.
The PCPU bathes you in caustic soda. Now
who’s a little red man, eh?
Sagittarius
Something fills you;
a feeling of dread
and it makes you
quite uncomfort-
able. You can’t quite
put your finger on
what it is. Whether that’s because the “some-
thing” is too large for your pinky or whether
you just don’t know what it is in a figurative
sense, is unclear. Life, I’m afraid, is nearing its
conclusion for you. Be at peace young child.
Capricorn
So Jess, I hear
on the grapevine
that you find the
words on this
page offensive, yet
surprise, surprise
we meet again. “Compulsive reading!” says
HoroscopesWorld.com. “Truly garish. A
thing of beauty” says HRSCP.com. “Flowery
hyperbole cannot do these zodiacs justice”
enforces HoroscopeCorp.orgasmatron.
Cancer
Hey, this is Barney.
26 years old, auburn
brown hair with a
set of eyes so blue
you could swim in
them. Likes mung-
ing, felching, turnips, Casper the Friendly
Ghost and a combination of the aforemen-
tioned. Currently suffering from chronic rim-
jaw, but will gladly lock horns with you when
the time is right. Call me, xxx.
Gemini
Vote A for: I like my
man, like I like my
coffee! Hot, strong
and sweet like
toffee! Ooohh ohh.
Vote B for: No way,
no way. Mm num mm nah. No way, no way.
Don’t get fresh with me! Vote C for: London,
London Bridge y’all. It’s London, London
Bridge y’all. Vote D for: Ooh boy I miss ya like
a hole in the head, ‘cos I do boy and ooh boy.
Leo
Thanks a lot. Be-
cause of you, wash-
ing machines in halls
are now yoinking a
good two quid from
the warm recesses of
our moneykeeping sacks. Happy now? Wasn’t
using two washing machines (coloured and
non-coloured, naturally) enough? Oh, and did
you bother wiping the lint off the dryer filters?
Of course not and now look what happened.
Taurus
Ten past one an-
nounces Volunteer
Number 3! Well,
you think, I’ve
got to sit here for
another five or six
hours at least. Ack, now I’m sounding bitter. I
am enjoying this, just at this moment I could
probably quite comfortably snuggle down on
the lush pastures of the green sofa and dream
booze, tits, football, chicken nuggets and lamb.
Aries
You’re on the home
straight now. Your
Copy Editors have
been and gone,
there’s still a bit of
news to be written,
but things are perking up. Speaking of perking
up... Oi, oi savavavavavava-loy! Twit twoo I say.
Look at the gazoombas on that one. Alright
love, is that a ladder in your skirt or a stairway
to heaven! HAVE IT! LAGER!
Pisces
Hiking through the
hidden, swirling
vortices of the
Galapagos Islands,
a man riding a four
wheeled tricycle
accosts you for some money. Unfortunately
you only have some old Italian Lire and a few
Hyrulian rupees. What’s a brother to do? You
offer him a piggy-back ride to Slovenia. Your
knees give way and he topples to his death.

The winner of Wordoku
1,381 was no one again. Too
hard? The hidden word was
“FATCLUNGE”.

Slitherlink 1,382
Aquarius
This week your eyes
being bleeding. You
think nothing of it
since your friend
tells you it happens
to her all the time,
just like when she slits her wrists. The trickle
of blood symbolises the passing of time, life
and eternity she reckons. What do you think
Constant Reader? Is she a barking mad lunatic
or the next Sylvia Plath?
Slitherlink 3 – Normal
Answert for Slitherlink 2
How to play:
Crudely speaking, Slitherlink is similar
to Minesweeper mixed with a dash of
Sudoku.
The object of the game is to draw
lines between the dots to create one
long, and most importantly, looping
line. It should have no start or finish;
just like an elastic band.
Each number indicates how many
lines should be drawn around it, for
example:
Cells which don’t contain a number
can be surrounded by any number of
lines.
Remember, the line must form a
loop, so the line cannot branch. The
following situations are not allowed:
Squares are not allowed either. There
are never cells containing the number
4 in Slitherlink.
So, where do you start? The most
common place to start on a Slitherlink
grid is by drawing crosses around any
zeros. Drawing crosses is purely done
to so that you know where there can’t
possibly be a line. So, take the pattern
below as an example. Begin by drawing
crosses, then by filling in some lines:
Now the lines can only continue in the
following directions:
The Slitherlinks on this page are basic
5x5 grids. Get practising because you
can expect some 10x10s later in the
term and perhaps even some severe
25x30 grids when we’re feeling really
mean. Email us to let us know how you
got on with these ones.
