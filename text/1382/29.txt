Brace yourself
“S
kydiving? You must
be joking! Me, jump
out of that plane
there? No, way.
That’s for two types
of people, the Bear Grylls ex-SAS
type, and the insane.
You couldn’t be more wrong.
Psychologists initially believed
that skydivers were insane, too.
That those involved with the sport
had some kind of latent death wish or a
need to prove themselves to their peers
by performing high risk activities. Sort
of like in Top Gun, but without the
homosexual overtones of the beach
volleyball scene. However, a study
of 293 high-risk competitors
(including skydivers) by Ben Ogilvie,
professor emeritus of psychology at
San Jose State University, suggest-
ed that the average skydiver was
highly motivated and had above
average intelligence. These high
achievers were more likely to
take calculated risks in order to
achieve their goals when compared
to their more conservative counter-
parts, hence their attraction to the
sport. Does this sound like anyone you
know? (Stop looking around. I’m talk-
ing about YOU.)
People from all walks of life skydive.
In Dan Poynter’s Parachuting: A Sky-
diver’s Handbook [Para Publishing,
2003] we see that skydivers mostly
come from middle management, fi-
nance and IT backgrounds – so they’re
geeks basically! Furthermore, a signifi-
cantly larger percentage of skydivers
have gone to university compared
to the proportion of the general
population who have. Clearly
the skydiving community
isn’t filled
with a bunch of
yahoo’s randomly
jumping out of com-
mercial airlines when-
ever they wish. Skydiv-
ers have families, they
like tea -- and they can be quite
boring when they start talking about
wing loading (the ratio of weight to
the area of the surface of the canopy
above them *yawn*).
OK, so I’d be lying if I said that sky-
diving was completely safe. There is an
element of risk and that is part of the
reason it is so much fun. The impor-
tant thing to realise is that this risk is
manageable. The British Parachute As-
sociation (BPA) [http://www.bpa.org.
uk] currently puts the injury rate for
experienced skydivers at 0.4 per 1000
jumps and the fatality rate at about 1
in 100,000 jumps. Let’s just think about
these figures for a while. An injury can
be anything from a scratch or a bruise
right the way through to sprains, frac-
tures and breakages. Thankfully the
majority of injuries are minor such as
a twisted ankle through an awkward
landing. So, as an experienced skydiver
performing routine jumps, statistically
you are likely to injure yourself once
every 2500 jumps. I can live with that.
Now, what about fatalities. Fatality rate
is awkward to compare from year to
year since the number is so small com-
pared to the total number of descents
made. You must also factor in that there
can be underlying reasons for death
which are not attributable to skydiv-
ing directly -- such as heart attacks and
other medical problems. Even taking
all of this into account the fatality rate
is still one in a hundred thousand or
0.00001%. Pretty low don’t you think?
Manageable even? I think so.
So what is it that makes the sport rela-
tively safe? The answer is simple. Good
instruction, a willingness to learn and
good equipment. Skydiving has been
an international sport since 1951 and
since then the equipment has come a
long way. All skydivers are equipped
with not one but two parachutes called
the main and reserve. The main is used
on a day-to-day basis and is packed by
yourself whilst the reserve is used only
in the case of a genuine emergency
such as a main failure. This reserve
is packed meticulously by a cer-
tified rigger, an expert in para-
chutes and their operation, and
must be repacked routinely to be sure
that it will be there when you need it.
Safety measures don’t stop here either.
All students in the UK are required to
jump with parachutes fitted with an
Automatic Activation Device (AAD)
so that, in the rare event that you can-
not or do not pull your main para-
chute, your reserve will fire automati-
cally when you fall below a particular
altitude at a particular speed. All of
this high tech equipment is explained
to you by expert instructors before you
ever see a plane.
So maybe I’ve con-
vinced some of you
now? You want to make a
jump, so that you can phone
home and scare your parents to
death. “What have we done, send-
ing our beloved Johnny off to Impe-
rial College... he’s going to jump out of
a plane!” they’ll say, but still you don’t
see how it can be a sport? Well it is.
There are several active disciplines
within the sport at the moment. The
two most popular ones that occur dur-
ing freefall (that’s the sixty seconds or
so that occurs after you peel off
of the side of the plane and be-
foreyouopenyourparachute)
