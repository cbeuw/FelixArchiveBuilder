are formation and freefly.
An example of formation would
be 4-way. That’s a team of four peo-
ple who exit the aircraft together and
make formations in the sky in a belly
to earth position (otherwise known as
a flat position earning them the name
flat fliers). Scores are awarded based
on how many formations or points the
team makes during their working time,
before they separate and deploy their
parachutes. A good 4 way team is a joy
to watch. Quick and meticulous. Like
a machine, albeit one that is hurtling
towards the earth at 140mph. Then
there is freefly, an artistic discipline.
Often done in a couple, but not always.
Think Torvill and Dean on crack.
There is no restriction on the
position of the sky-
diver in freefall. They may
be head down and spinning
like a helicopter -- their legs
acting like blades, or they may be
sitting and carving around a central
point of reference. The sky is the limit
(or the ground is) and all manoeuvres
are judged on their difficulty and artis-
tic merit.
People continually ask me “What is
it like? Do you feel like you are falling?”
The short answer is no. It’s more like
floating on a noisy bed of air. Once
you have hit your horizontal terminal
velocity in a position there is no accel-
eration. Even as you are accelerating
downwards towards your terminal it
doesn’t feel like it since you are slow-
ing down in the horizontal axis (you
are still moving forward when you exit
at the same speed as the plane).
“But I’m scared of heights?” This
is unlikely to be a hindrance. Do
you feel high when you are in a
commercial airliner? If not, you
are unlikely to feel that in freefall
since your perspective changes so
slowly you never really experience the
sensation of falling, and you are hap-
pily under canopy before the ground
ever rushes up to meet you. “What
if I don’t like it?” Well, that’s a possibil-
ity but put it this way; I’ve never seen
anyone come down who wasn’t smil-
ing. If you are really nervous you could
always come to the tunnel with us?
This simulates the experience of
freefall, without the falling! The
idea is that a jet of air is blown
up to meet you and this sus-
pends you in a vertical column.
It’s cheaper than skydiving,
less nerve-wracking and
gives us the opportunity
to try things out on
the ground, before
putting them
into practice
in the air.
Hopefully,
by now you
are desper-
ate to give
itago,and
maybe you have a desire to
become a qualified skydiver
and join us high above Ox-
fordshire? Well, you are in luck.
IC Parachuting and Skydiving exists
to get you falling to earth as quickly as
possible. You could do a tandem jump
with us where you are strapped to an
instructor? Or you could take the first
steps to qualification with the Ram Air
Progression System (RAPS) or Ad-
vanced Freefall (AFF).
RAPS is a scheme which many of
our members have embarked on. For
your first jump you leave the aircraft at
a low altitude (3000ft) and your para-
chute is automatically deployed by a
cord attached to the plane. The initial
jumps concentrate on a good exit
position and canopy handling (as
your canopy will be open as soon
as you exit) so you won’t experi-
ence freefall until later on in the
course. Around twenty to thirty
jumps are required to graduate as
a solo skydiver. AFF is the quickest op-
tion, which can get you qualified in a
matter of a week or so. Although it can
be more expensive, you do get to ex-
perience freefall immediately. The first
jump is from a normal exit altitude
(12,500 - 15,000ft) with two instruc-
tors holding on to you throughout.
After a sequence of eight jumps, each
progressively harder than the next,
you will be qualified to exit alone to
perform your consolidation jumps.
After a further ten are completed you
are qualified. Off to the bar! While
each system has advantages and disad-
vantages both lead to an FAI ‘A’ licence
which is recognised world wide.
So do you think you have what
it takes for you and your mates
to jump together from a perfectly
good aircraft two and a half miles
high, grinning at each other as
you perform acrobatics and try to
outdo each other at a vertical speed
of 140mph? When you factor in the
sun beating down on your neck as you
come in to land you’ll realise that this is
not just a sport, it’s the only sport.
