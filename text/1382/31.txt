How Not To...
F
elix’s duty to the people is to
inform and entertain. This
week we are going beyond
the call of duty to bring you
an invaluable guide that will
help you garner the greatest enjoyment
possible from all those hedonistic par-
ties that you’ll be attending throughout
the year. Not only that though, Felix is
giving the following sound advice so
that you know what not to do and say
at a party, and also to prevent yourself
from being a complete mongfart. We’re
entirely qualified to say so.
Step 1: Share your alcohol
Don’t get precious about those bot-
tles of shandy you’ve got stashed in
the rucksack on your back. Take your
backpack off, unzip it and crack open
the brewskis. Spread the wealth you
tight bastard.
Step 2: Don’t comment on the
music that’s playing
Look, no one cares whether you think
the music is shit. Likewise, no one
cares if you believe this tune is totally
slamming. All you end up doing when
you start talking about music at a party
is get into an argument or a fight. Just
get funkeh to those cheesy choons and
you’ll be having a whale of a time.
Step 3: Don’t affect a stammer to
look intellectual
W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w-well, the... reason
one shouldn’t t-t-t-talk with a stam-
mer is because one comes-across-as-
an-uppity-arse. Just because you can
pause for breath in between six syllable
words, it doesn’t make you some kind
of divine student that others should
stand and be in awe of. Get over your-
self, sip on some bud and take it easy.
Step 4: Don’t talk about your
lectures or your course
This really is the oldest one in the
book. You’ve just finished three hours
worth of learning about the different
names of the bones in your leg (tibia,
fibia, kneecap, bronchitis, albumen –
score! 5 out of 5) and some over eager
beaver is still questioning whether the
content of the lecture was pitched well
enough. Who cares? Seriously. Well,
now you’ve gone there, if you think the
lecture was that bad, why don’t you try
taking it yourself? Heck.
Enough already. Just don’t talk
shop and everyone will get along just
great. The exception to the rule is a
Vvvvvvvedensky lecture, of course.
Step 5: Don’t be a non-drinking,
teetotal moron
You’re not better than anyone else by
not drinking, you know? Wow, you’re
taking a stand against the mainstream
by not consuming alcohol – aren’t you
making mummy and daddy proud? If
you want, we’ll get you started on some
Hooch, after all that watch me go off
my trolley for the very first time. We’ll
move on to the harder hitting stuff
(SoCo&L anyone?) gradually and we’ll
have you attending sports night in the
Union in no time at all.
Step 6: If you insist on being
teetotal, don’t bang on about it
So you’re as stubborn as the day is long.
Stop wishing for other people to join in
on your misery. If you’re not going to
live life to the max and consume, don’t
brain wash everyone else with your
way-out-there views.
Step 7: Don’t harp on about your
bloody A-levels
How long ago did you take those ex-
ams? No one cares for starts and no
one wants to know. If you insist on
comparing yourself to everyone else
at the party, ask them about shoe size
or something like that. You know what
they say, big feet, big...
Step 8: Drink some more!
Fast flowing, delicious and golden. Get
it down your neck and the world will
become your own hazy oyster.
Step 9: Don’t focus all your en-
ergy on one lady
Unless you’re a player or a billy-no-
mates, you probably attend parties
with a group of your mates. Mates be-
ing the keyword here. If you spot a sexy
chica/chap from afar, don’t spend the
rest of the evening gawping at him/her
like some lecherous vulture about to
swoop onto your prey. Mosey on over,
introduce her to your friends and get
everyone involved. She’ll realise you’re
not a loner and you’ll be better off for
it.
Step 10: Hellamashup
Need I say more.
Please drink responsibly
1. Get yourself a padlock and keep your door locked!
2. Wash your hands directly afterwards
3. Make sure you’re not sweaty and flustered
