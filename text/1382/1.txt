Inside
State of the Nation’s
Education
...the assumption is that if you’re
clever enough you will go to university.
But these young people who are saying
‘people like me don’t go to university’

The system has to change. It will then
make people think twice before they go off
and do damn silly courses that are no good
to them and won’t get them a good job at the
end of the day. It would mean university is not
just a nice four years off
“

free education funded entirely by the

Union revokes all previous policy on higher
education funding, pending a consultation
with the student body
