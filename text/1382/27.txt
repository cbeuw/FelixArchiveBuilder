The Union Trustee Board is the governing body of the Union and consists of the
President, Council Chair, Court Chair, 4 student trustees and 4 lay members who
are not members of the Union but have expertise in areas such as health and
safety, finance and management. The Trustee Board meets roughly six times per
year to ensure that the Union is being run well and it does this by scrutinising the
work of the Council and the Executive Committee.
