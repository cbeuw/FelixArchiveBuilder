Commitment = muscles
Chiraush Patel

Ask a new boy in the gym and they
may tell you that heavy weights plus
adrenaline equals a buff body.
But ask any lifter, any real lifter, and
they will tell you that it’s not what you
do in the gym, but what you do in the
real world that separates Brad Pitt’s ac-
tual legs from Brad Pitt’s leg double in
Troy (sorry to break it to you ladies).
Yes, a point that was touched upon by
Alex Fergusson in last week’s issue was
indeed correct, lifting heavy weights is
no good unless you supplement it with
good nutrition and, of course, good
supplements; which will be discussed
at length in a later supplements issue.
Commitment to a good body is a way
of life. Period. That is why the average
Joe is just that… average. But ask your-
self, would you settle for an average
car; an average house; an average job?
I’m not saying you have to overhaul
your life to achieve this, and to be fair a
bodybuilder’s working day is hard to fit
in a student’s 24 hrs, but if you’re going
to do something you might as well try
and do it right.
Sleep, believe it or not, is an integral
part of muscle building. As you sleep,
your body releases hormones and
growth factors during the night which
aidmusclegrowthandrecovery.There-
fore, 8 is the requisite number of hours
of sleep for good muscle building.
Nutrition is supremely important;
after all, your muscle has to come
from somewhere. First of all, meals…
you need about five of them a day. Not
five three-courses but five small meals.
This gives your body a constant source
of energy and keeps your hormones
in check. Breakfast is a must. Whole-
some, full of protein and slow releasing
carbs, without it you will go fat. This
means oats, eggs, low fat cheese and
wholemeal bread get the thumbs up.
Last night’s pizza is a hell no!! Lunch
should consist of lean meat, pasta
and salad. In between, fruit and semi
skimmed milk should do the trick.
Prior to your workout you may re-
quire a boost… red bull (sugarfree) and
half a protein shake will turn an OK
workout into a mind blowing, plateau
crushing experience. Sports drinks are
a no-no as the sugar high will lead to
an inevitable crash halfway during
your workout. Just keep to water dur-
ing your workout and lots of it.
However the real gains come in
the post-workout, when muscles are
primed for growth… I like the post-
workout meal given last week but spare
no expense if you strive for perfection
– protein shakes are a must, and din-
ner should be meaty and veggie!
The oak chest, when perfected it is
the statement of manliness. Look at
your typical rugby player and you’ll
see a proud chest puffed out showing
you he is something. Everyone knows
perculating pecs drive the ladies wild,
and I know you want to get that too.
So stick to the following base chest
program and turn the pigeon chest
into something you can puff out and
be proud. Remember: select weights
which are heavy enough so that you
reach muscular failure at the desired
rep number.
A finisher is an aspect of training
that most people overlook; a final push
to achieve maximal results from your
work out. A chance to put your tired,
batteredbodythroughonemoreround.
A tri-set is the combination of three ex-
ercises completed in quick succession
and counts as one set. A tri-set combi-
nation is completed three times; hence
three sets, and each time you change
the order of the exercise. Hence, using
the final exercises, the first set should
be 1,2,3; the second 2,3,1 and the final
3,1,2. Follow me? This way you achieve
an equal work out and finish with a
chiselled chest that separates the men
from young pretenders.
Ladies, ladies, ladies. You must be
thinking this page is men only, but ‘Mr
Muscle’ is an equal opportunity info
machine… look out for next week’s la-
dies’ issue!
Felix takes no responsibility if you
break yourself in half whilst trying
to lift weights that are clearly too
heavy for you. Man up!
The league is underway!
The ranking of the teams is based on
the Felix Index (FI), which is calculated
as follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) – (L*3).
Only teams with 5 games or more will
be considered in the overall champion-
ship at the end of year. With this weeks
results in, rugby men’s 1st team have
shot up to 2nd place whilst the 3rd
team is sadly rooted to the bottom.
