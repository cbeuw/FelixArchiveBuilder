Music
Music Editors – Jenny Gibson and Matty Hoban
This is not a joke, I literally could not find a big enough picture of the band and this photo is really pretty
Foals are young stallions
Foals lead singer and guitarist Yannis
Philippakis took a few minutes to talk
to Music Felix before the gig at the Sca-
la (reviewed overleaf) to answer some
of our questions.
Felix – You’re on a headline tour at
the moment – how is it going? Is
it very tiring? You’re all very ener-
getic on stage…
Yannis – Yes, I’m very tired.
But you still keep going?
Yeah, I got in a fight in Reading where
I got my earring pulled out of my ear,
and I’ve got an ulcer. Our guitarist
chipped his tooth, our bassist has two
black eyes and that’s all just from the
last four days!
There’s not going to be any can-
celling of dates though?
No - there’s no ‘Plan B’ for us!
You’ve just recorded your new
album (with Dave Sitek of TV on
the Radio in New York), which I’m
very excited about. What was it
like working with Dave?
(Jokingly) pretty unpleasant.
Did he push you hard?
It was just a big ego clash!
Hopefully he knows what he’s do-
ing though…
Yeah, he does. He’s a good friend of
mine now.
Any idea of a release date?
March sometime. There’ll be some
stuff released off it before, some singles
and things.
New songs?
Well, Balloons is the first single, and
that’s an old one, but after that, yeah.
Why did you decide not to put
some of your older songs on the
album? Have you moved on from
them?
Yeah, we always like to progress. We
write prolifically, so it doesn’t make
sense to keep re-releasing the same
songs. I don’t like albums where you’ve
heard four of the songs before because
then it doesn’t feel like an album, it’s
just a collection of songs!
I’ve noticed listening to your older
songs on the demos that there’s a
big difference between them and
your new singles…
You think so? Really?
Definitely! Not only in the style,
where I assume you didn’t have
much in the means of production
facilities available at the time,
but also structurally some of your
songs like ‘Hummer’ have changed
a lot from the demos.
Well, we recorded that demo in a barn
for free!
So have the songs changed be-
cause you couldn’t record them
as you wanted to when you start-
ed, or have they evolved as you
played them live into something
different?
Definitely both. We always want to
Various pathetic equine jokes aside, Foals are rising stars and have survived the hype
around nu-rave because luckily they have a strong history in the UK underground
Foals are signed to Transgressive
Records and are touring

Music Editor
H
ello is what someone
would say to you upon
greeting you. Now to
put that word into con-
text, I am going to greet
you and say hello and welcome to the
music section as it would normally
appear. What I mean by that is that we
have reviews and an interview for you
to peruse.
First of all, Toby Prudden went to
go see Foals live at Scala in North
London and managed to have a quick
word with them before they per-
formed. Foals have featured members
of Edmund Fitzgerald and Youthmovie
Soundtrack Strategies who were
(and in the latter case, are) staples
of the underground music scene in
this country over the past few years.
Foals started off with three guitarists
and utilised this to have interweaving
arpeggiated guitars with taut drums.
One guitarist was replaced with a
keyboardist and they expanded on
their drummer’s more upbeat style
to produce polyrhythmic riffs with a
four-to-the-floor backbeat. They have,
through constant touring and hard
work, attained quite a following.
Thank you to all of those who signed
up to write, photograph, or edit Felix
at Freshers’ Fayre. We, as a section,
will be getting in touch but if you want
to come meet us then come to the
union at 12:30 on Friday 12th October
(ie. today); talk about short notice. You
can always e-mail us or come down
to the Felix office in the West Wing of
Beit Quad at any time (well, sensible
hours) to find out more.
We would love to have as many
reviews as possible or any form of
contribution. You can swag some
interviews with bands you like, free
CDs and free entry into gigs that we
get offered. It’s all FREE, and you don’t
need to prove anything other than
your enthusiasm and willingness to
get involved. I don’t get paid to do
this, nor does Jenny, so we are fuelled
on poor enthusiasm (and blood).
Also for those who don’t know
much about how the music industry
works, i.e. public relations, getting a
record deal, putting out a record and
publishing, then I will use this column
to (sometimes cynically) explain the
inner workings of the business of mu-
sic. Appreciation of music is relative
and only by having as many different
reviews from as many people as possi-
ble can we get a greater picture or ap-
preciation. However, the mechanisms
and workings of the music industry
are, for the most part, fact and strewn
with human influence (hence my cyni-
cism) that can be commented.
There may not be a music section
every week depending on how much
material and/or time we have. It
would be wonderful if anyone would
be willing to take over as music editor
as both Jenny and I are in our final
years. If you are interested in learn-
ing more about the inner workings of
getting gigs and free CDs or how to
lay-out a page in a newspaper then
please e-mail us. Or if you want to just
chat then get in touch.
“I think a live set
is just meant to
be relentless and
in your face and
energetic and
violent”
progress, so I don’t ever want to write
a song that sounds like Hummer ever
again. Not because I don’t like it, but
because I don’t find the idea of stag-
nancy enjoyable, and I don’t under-
stand why some bands do!
So do you think that if you were
still playing in five years’ time you
would still play the ‘classics’ live,
or would you be the kind of band
that only plays the new album?
Yeah, the live thing is different, I like
doing everything live. I think a live set is
just meant to be relentless and in your
face and energetic and violent, and that
will always be like that. I’m interested
in making records, and I think the live
experience is something that is pretty
much divorced from that and they are
two very separate arenas in which I
perform. I enjoy both equally, but the
progression of the idea of what Foals is
as a band is like a recorded thing. Live
it is always going to have this energy. I
hope so anyway!
You’re supporting Bloc Party on
their arena tour. Are you nervous?
Excited?
I get nervous when I leave my house
so I’m used to that! But yes, I do get
nervous.
Do you see yourself ever headlin-
ing venues that size?
No, not that size!
Let me ask you about Youthmov-
ies – you’re good friends with
them…
Yeah, best friends! Andrew (Youth-
movies’ lead singer/guitarist) is my
best friend.
Have you heard their album yet?
Have they given you a copy?
Yeah, I have.
What’s it like? Give us the inside
information!
(Jokingly) Pretty rubbish!
Nothing like as good as yours I
suppose?
No, it’s good! He is my best friend in
the whole world – I’d take bullets for
him!
Can you see a joint tour coming in
the future?
Yeah, possibly.
After your last band, ‘The Edmund
Fitzgerald’, split up you said it was
because it wasn’t fun anymore. Do
you ever see that happening with
Foals? Could you just get bored
with this and want to do some-
thing completely different? Could
you just drop it all and move on?
Yeah, definitely. If it got boring or if it
wasn’t fulfilling or I felt like we hadn’t
achieved what we should have then I
would stop. There is so much differ-
ent stuff I want to do other than this,
and it’s the same for all of us. Our next
record might just be ‘Cello and drums,
no guitars – but it will still be Foals. I
think there is something intrinsic to it
that will always be there, but the tex-
tures and the way we produce sounds
might be completely different. I find
it really weird when people say ‘I can’t
believe you put brass on your record’
or ‘I can’t believe there’s no synths
on it’ – because there isn’t any. Why
should you be so offended with the way
we produce sounds? It will still sound
like us!
How would you do that live? If
the new songs have got brass on
them will you get a brass section
to tour with you?
I don’t know, we have to try and sort
that out.
You have said before that you
write songs for people to dance
to. Would you write a song that
you couldn’t dance to? A ballad
maybe?
Absolutely! There are songs on the al-
bum you can’t dance to.
Ok, thanks for taking the time to
talk to us.
No problem!
