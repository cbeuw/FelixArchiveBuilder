The debate: nature versus nourriture
I
decided to get over-analytical
when I read recently that Hes-
ton Blumenthal, proprietor of
the world’s ‘best’ restaurant (poll
of 600 journos and critics), The
Fat Duck in Bray, Berkshire, had over-
dosed his head chef with chilli oil in an
attempt to locate the neural correlate of
the pleasure derived from ‘hot’ (NOT
the same thing as ‘spicy’) food. That is,
which part of the brain was affected,
and might subsequently be targeted.
Because it seems to me this approach
contrasts somewhat with the philoso-
phy another Michelin three-star win-
ner, Marco Pierre White, spoke of on
Hell’s Kitchen. As we watched Marco
casting for and netting a beautiful fish,
we heard him saying a chef should “let
mother nature do the talking”, and that
their role is to simply reveal Her beauty,
rather than attempt to improve on Her.
In the name of the 80:20 rule (without
getting too bogged down in how well
I portray these immense achievers and
their central philosophies), I will now
give my tuppence-ha’penny’s worth on
the matter; because there is a differ-
ence, and I believe it’s a rather impor-
tant one.
The difference, I suspect, is the same
as the difference between attempting
to engineer our planetary environment
using man’s machines, and simply liv-
ing harmoniously with the rest of life,
which maintain the conditions on
earth fit for human life as an emergent
property of the earth system. Because
the biosphere is surely the best life-
support system we will ever have.
It is the same difference, let me go on,
as between excessive genetic engineer-
ing of our offspring, and relying on our
sense of beauty and love to guide us
through our lives. Because we will nev-
er fully be able to calculate for certain
whom we should procreate with, and
at what time. It’s heroic to live a full life
in the face of non-total knowledge.
Thirdly and finally, I say it is the same
difference as between again relying on
external ‘chemical’ stimulants to feel
we are fully alive, and doing truly hu-
man things to make us happy – the
humanness judged with reference to
beliefs about the way our minds work,
springing from knowledge of evolu-
tionary theory. After all, we are hu-
mans aren’t we?
Felix examines whether food as a science is a valid concept or whether you just need the finest ingredients
As any good scientist knows, nature
can simply be defined away as “what
happens anyway”; and of course there
is no clear dichotomy between the
chemical and the organic (what about
organic chemistry!). So yes, use sci-
ence to improve cooking techniques
and understand the pleasure derived in
terms of brain processes and the biol-
ogy of visual aesthetics. However, here
is my point: We are fools if we think we
should part from our own human na-
ture, or can improve on Mother Nature.
As my hero E. O. Wilson ends his book,
Consilience: The Unity of Knowledge
(the best book I have ever read; utterly
life changing; far better than Dawkins;
Noel Forrest read it), “What does it all mean? This is
what it all means. To the extent that we
depend on prosthetic devices to keep
ourselves and the biosphere alive, we
will render everything fragile. To the
extent that we banish the rest of life, we
will impoverish our own species for all
time. And if we should surrender our
genetic nature to machine-aided rati-
ocination, and our ethics and art and
our very meaning to a habit of careless
discursion in the name of progress,
imagining ourselves god-like and ab-
solved from our ancient heritage, we
will become nothing.”
So I’m in MPW’s camp, but happy to
be proved wrong, Heston, if there’s any
danger I could get a table?
I was tempted to call this the
‘perfect’ cup of tea, but that
would be to over-hype a proc-
ess so simple that it pains me
that you don’t do it.
It actually hurts me to see a
teabag fondled with a spoon in
a ‘flash-stewing’ attempt. Ex-
pect to be judged when I come
over for a cuppa.
You have been warned!
This popular Italian dish should
ideally be cooked over char-
coal in the summer but, failing
that, a grill will do fine. Extra
Virgin olive oil (from the first
cold pressing) has a more pep-
pery flavour and works bet-
ter than plain olive in lightly
cooked Italian dishes such as
this but the latter will also do
fine here. Great as a snack any
time of day.
You’ll need the following:
3 very ripe tomatoes
1 small clove of garlic, finely
chopped
1 tbsp of olive oil, plus some
to drizzle
Basil (optional), chopped
salt and pepper to season
2 slices bread
1) Chop the tomatoes roughly
and cook in a pan with the ta-
blespoon of olive oil for 3-4
minutes, stirring round until
they are heated through. Sea-
son will salt and pepper to
taste.
2) In the meantime, drizzle a
small amount of olive oil over
the bread and toast until brown
under the grill on both sides (the
oil will make a bit of a mess of a
toaster).
3) Chuck the chopped basil in with
the tomatoes and heat through.
Recipes: Bruschetta and tea – you’ll eat what we tell you to and you’ll like it
Serve on the toasted bread.
This recipe serves 1 and takes
approximately 5 minutes to pre-
pare, 5 minutes to cook and only
costs 40p per portion. So you
have no excuse. Try it now!
Cheat’s bruschetta
An acceptable cup of tea
Marco Pierre White: The devil in the kitchen
1) Put teabag in preferably warm
mug.
2) Fill to brim with just-boiled
water.
3) Leave for three minutes.
4) Remove bag with minimal
squeezing, creating room for the
milk.
5) Add milk and sugar to taste, or
a slice of lemon. Mine’s a milk no
sugar, please.
