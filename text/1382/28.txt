W
elcome to a brand
spanking new sec-
tion of Felix: “Chal-
lenge the Sabbs”.
Before I answer
the question: “What the hell is Chal-
lenge the Sabbs?”, I propose a number
of questions that you should ask your-
selves. Go on, indulge me.
Have you ever wanted to go toe-
to-toe with the President in a boxing
ring?
Has one of the Deputy Presidents
ever restricted your club’s spending,
making you want to rugby tackle him
to the ground, subsequently followed
by a massive bundle of hulking great
props?
Has one of the Deputy Presidents got
one of those faces that you just want to
shoot with your paintball gun? Or per-
haps one of the DPs is so beautiful you
really want to paint a glorious picture
of them but you’re afraid to ask in case
you come across as some kind of freak
stalker.
Maybe you’re fed up of hearing about
how one of the Deputy Presidents is off
on yet another gruelling fund-raising
adventure and what you’d really like
to see is one of them doing something
that is actually challenging. Land’s End
to John O’Groats? Rubbish. Try scaling
the French Alps you big sissy.
Are you so fed up with the amount of
spelling mistakes in Felix that you want
the Editor to take a literacy test?
Or do you just want to sit down with
one of the helpful, lovable Sabbaticals
and play a game of chess or backgam-
mon with them?
I think you’re probably getting the
idea now, so I can answer your original
question:
“What the hell is Challenge the
Sabbs?”
Challenge the Sabbs is about taking
on the Sabbatical Officers at whatever
game you can think of. You might want
to have a drinking competition against
a number of them, you might want to
get a bit more physical with them and
play a game of tennis, or you might
want to come up with something com-
pletely different. In fact, we actively
encourage you to do just that. Think
hard. Come up with the most imagi-
native variation on a well known game
and we’ll jump at the chance to beat
you at it. A report – probably a biased
one – will be written up after the chal-
lenge has taken place and the winner
will be announced. Over the course of
the year, a running tally will be kept
and we’ll see whether the student body
can match the Sabbaticals’ prowess.
Who is eligible to submit a
challenge?
Anyone! That means clubs, societies,
individual students and even the Rec-
tor if he fancies it.
Whilst Challenge the Sabbs is clearly
suited towards the clubs and socie-
ties of Imperial, anyone can submit a
challenge. For instance, if you’re really
good at unicycle riding but there is no
club associated with your particular
talent, you’re free to take us on.
Similarly, we’re happy to take on
group challenges as long as we can get
the Sabbs together in one place, at the
same time!
I’ve got an idea for a challenge,
what next?
Great! Next you need to email Tom
Roberts on felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Tell him all about your challenge, how
many Sabbs will be needed and per-
haps even suggest a time and a place.
If for instance your club practises on a
set night each week, let us know and
we’ll see if we can get a team of Sabbs
together for that evening.
Once you’ve sent the email, you’ll
probably get a bundle back and there’ll
be some more questions asked. We’ll
then finalise the rules of the challenge
if it’s not completely obvious. Finally,
the challenge will take place!
What was the email address to
send challenges to again?
felix@imperial.ac.uk.
Good luck, you’re going to need it!
