RCSU: A Freshers’ Week to remember
W
hoosh! Well that’s
Freshers’ Fortnight
gone. We hope you
all enjoyed it as
much as we did!
We’ve had a truly brilliant couple of
weeks and we’ve just got time to tell
you about our favourite bits!
Freshers’ Ball
Last Monday 8th Oct we had the most
amazing Freshers’ Ball ever ever held
by the RCSU! We packed out Zoo Bar
& Club on Leicester Square with over
700 of our finest Imperial Freshers
– mostly scientists but a few friends
from the other faculties as well! We all
enjoyed free vodka Red Bulls, cham-
pagne and chocolate fountains for our
£5 ticket and no doubt the highlight for
most of the blokes would have been all
of the girls dancing on the bar! We’re
putting this record attendance and
fabulous fun down to our wonderful
guests and our break from tradition!
I would also, personally, like to give a
big shout out to James Field, my Vice
President (Activities) and all his little
minions who worked so hard to ensure
we had a fantastic night!
Buddies
Our buddy schemes have been kick-
ing off in the science departments this
year with the aim to pair up a fresher
with a big person to help them over
any hurdles they might meet at Im-
perial. So if you’re a big person then
make sure you look after your fresher
and if you’re a fresher then make use
of your big person – whether you want
advice on courses, essay skills, or any-
thing else! We would also like to point
out that no one was hurt in the Krispy
Kreme doughnut wars which ensued
during the biology buddy meeting!
Book Sale
In an effort to stop students being
too badly crippled in the wallet when
it comes to textbooks we continued
down the path of previous years and
held a second hand book sale whereby
old students could sell their textbooks
on. This year we had over a thousand
books put in for the sale and the ma-
jority disappeared in a flash last Tues-
day 9th Oct (we probably would have
completely sold out had it not been for
the Freshers’ Ball the previous night!)
Our Academic Affairs Officer Andreas
Esau deserves many congratulations
for the hard work he put in! Next year
we might have to invest in a trolley see-
ing as we had to carry all those books
from the union to our new office on
the Sherfield Walkway!
Elections
We have mop up elections for the few
positions that were left unfilled last
term. So if you’re a budding sports of-
ficer, publicity & communications of-
ficer, secretary, postgraduate research
rep (in life sci and phys sci), biochem-
istry or joint maths and computing
department rep then please stand for
elections at imperialcollegeunion.
org/vote. Join the team! Nominations
close on the 14th October at 23.59!

How to smile
S
ociety has gone mad. The
streets of London are full of
dull, grey, pointless zombies.
We stare downwards when
we walk and make sure we
are too fast for anyone to catch up with
us. We don’t talk on the tube, and if we
are alone, most often we have a ‘Lon-
don Lite’ clamped to our arms or we
are listening to music to prevent any
social interaction. I feel like we’re all
living in a concrete bubble.
Once we get to work – what hap-
pens? We are trapped in a race up
the ladder, to be better than our col-
leagues, to prove what we have and
what we’ve learnt. That is the prob-
lem with our education system, our
culture, our civilisation. From school
Priya G
we are tutored in excelling individual
and fighting each other off. There’s lit-
tle emphasis on teamwork apart from
group sports and even then little pity
is reserved for the opposing side. The
friends we make are unlikely to be our
closest contenders in our profession
and even if that is so, if there were a
choice between progressing in a ca-
reer, or salvaging a friendship, I believe
most people would choose their career.
What a pitiable state of affairs when
you think back to why jobs were cre-
ated in the first place. Human kind had
a need for certain materials in order
to survive and those capable of doing
them did them. However, as technolo-
gy advanced and money became more
and more important, the competitive
thirst arose in those who were able to
complete isolate work from being an
all round decent person.
I find it impossible to understand
how you could plunge the knife in the
back of a person you have been work-
ing with for the past week, let alone
year. Why can’t we work together to
find solutions? Why do we always have
to superior to somebody else? Why
can’t we just appreciate the talents of
our colleagues and ourselves?
I believe it’s time to get out of this rat
race. We need to stop comparing our-
selves to other people and believe in
ourselves and what we are good at.
We need to slow down, take a deep
breath, look up for the sky for once and
actually appreciate that we have a life,
only one, and that we should enjoy it.
Forget about work for just one day, stop
running around and stressing about
deadlines and essays. A hundred years
from now nobody will care whether we
were able to read that extra chapter.
We need to stop living for other peo-
ple’s expectations and for what we have
been dictated to do.
Just for once in our lives, we need to
be still, look at the trees, the plants, and
the world, watch the people around us,
look at how lucky we have it, and smile.
Smile.
Look past the grey for the blue and
you’ll feel a million times better. I
promise. If you are lucky, maybe some-
one will smile back! You won’t know
unless you try.
I got beef with beef
F
or most of us in the west-
ern world clean water is a
seemingly infinite resource
and the only portal of ex-
posure to calamities such
as water-borne disease epidemics and
droughts is the news. But a change is
imminent and sooner than one would
expect. At present, close to a third of
the world’s population is plagued by
water crises. If current trends in wa-
ter consumption continue, this figure
is expected to augment to include two
thirds of the globe by 2025.
To put further perspective on this
figure and its impact, consider a Unit-
ed Nations (UN) statement issued
recently which claims that access to
water will be reduced by a third of that
available today within the next two
decades – regardless of geographical
location. To add further fuel to the fire,
leading political economists are going
so far as to predict a grizzly shift in the
nature of global conflicts and discord
from oil and politics to water. This may
seem like an embroidered doomsday
scenario, but current data is certainly
validating it as a plausible notion.
To overcome such an eerie aftermath
which could threaten the very founda-
tion of humanity, we must first gather
some insight into the causes of water
crises. Presently, there is in fact enough
water to satisfy the needs of the entire
global population, but there is a mas-
sive disparity in consumption between
the developed and developing worlds.
For instance here in London we each
consume in excess of a whopping 170
liters of water per day on average in
personal usage, which far exceeds the
UN Human Development Index pre-
scribed 50 liters per day per domestic
household needed to maintain a mini-
mum standard of living. On the other
hand in some African countries, an
average household may barely receive
a fifth of this prescribed minimum and
what they do get comes with heavy
strings attached such as life-threaten-
ing illnesses including cholera.
Besides excessive personal water us-
age, it is the agricultural sector and the
lavish patterns of food consumption in
the West which are further exacerbat-
ingthewatercrisis.Exorbitantamounts
of meat and dairy products have firmly
established themselves as the mangy
mainstays of the typical Western diet
and their consumption now presents
more than just health risks.
Tending livestock and poultry
amongst other primary sector activi-
ties accounts for a massive 70 % of to-
tal water usage in the UK. To fathom
just how much water is depleted from
such activities, consider beef produc-
tion, where a single kilogram of the
meat drains 15 cubic meters of pre-
cious H2
0.
Besides the obvious economic costs
of depleted water supplies, there are
the bleak prospects of mass popula-
tion displacement, famine and war. It
seems that despite the grave long-term
threats it poses to our survival water
wastage has not been deemed an ur-
gent enough problem to be tackled
in the general ‘green shift’ in govern-
mental policy and corporate activ-
ity towards environmentally friendly
practices.
As of now there is no legislation in
Britain to limit water supplies to house-
holds unwilling to pay their water bills
and neither have any serious measures
been put in place to encourage homes
or the farming sector to curb water
consumption. Talks of privatizing the
water supply in the UK has been met
with scathing criticism and heavy
backlash on grounds of depriving the
population of a basic necessity. How-
ever, it seems that water will surely as-
cend in status to a luxury commodity if
we don’t devise a viable method soon
to stay within our aqueous means.
