GSA Chair under fire
On Monday night, the First Council
meeting of the 2007-08 year was held
in the Union Dining Hall.
The first half of the meeting passed
quickly and without incident. Reports
written by the Sabbatical Officers and
Faculty Union staff were being passed
as tabled, without objection from
the Council members. The reports
– which can be found on the Union’s
website – are mainly for accountability
purposes, so that the student body has
the opportunity to see that the Sabbati-
cal Officers and Faculty Union staff are
doing their jobs satisfactorily.
The proceedings were running
smoothly and rather hastily until it
was the turn of the GSA (Graduate
Students Association) Chair Jon Mat-
thews to put forward his report. Un-
ion President Stephen Brown ques-
tioned Mr Matthews, telling him that
he thought the report “was not doing
himself justice”. After some futile ex-
planation from Mr Matthews, Council
moved to a vote which ultimately led to
the report being rejected.
Now, are you ready for this? It’s com-
plicated. Deep breath...
The specific reason the paper was re-
jected remains unclear. It appears that
Council is unhappy with the amount of
work Mr Matthews has done over the
summer period in return for the £2000
honorarium that the GSA Chair is cus-
tomarily awarded.
So far the GSA Chair has been in of-
fice for only five weeks. Due to the aw-
ful GSA elections that took place over
the summer, the Chair was elected
later than originally intended. Seem-
ingly, Union Officials believe the hono-
rarium was intended as payment for an
eight week period and as a result, Mr
Matthews has been given too much
money.
However, the original intention of
the honorarium has been questioned
and remains the focus of ongoing in-
vestigations in the Union.
Advocates of the GSA are saying that
the honorarium is intended as a pay-
ment for the year, rather than just the

John Collins completes
fund-raising bicycle ride
Last year’s Union President John Collins recently completed
his cycle ride from Land’s End to John O’Groats, on the second
attempt. The 928 mile trek took Mr Collins thirteen days to
complete, excluding the days in between attempts. Mr Collins’
was due to complete the journey back in June but he fell from his
bicycle breaking his wrist in the process. The proceeds from the
trip will be put towards the redevelopment of Beit. Donations can
still be made at www.justgiving.com/pedalingforimperial
summer and that its purpose is to be
attractive enough to tempt potential
GSA Chairs away from paid teaching
work within College.
Union Officials argue that the pay-
ment is similar to that of the Faculty
Union Presidents, intended as a sum-
mer payment and no more.
Added to all of this excitement, the
circumstances under which Mr Mat-
thews received the honorarium pay-
ment are shadowy.
If you’re still with me, good on you,
we’re almost there... Just one long and
winding paper trail to follow now.
Originally, the GSA asked the Union
Executive (Exec) committee to fund
the summer honorarium at a meeting
during the summer. Exec refused and
told the GSA that it needed to sort the
matter out itself.
Subsequently, £2000 was taken out
of the GSA budget to pay the honorar-
ium. What remains unclear is how this
payment was authorised. Minutes are
not taken at GSA committee meetings
meaning that no written record exists
of who authorised payment.
The Union has asked the GSA for an
audit trail to trace the circumstances
under which the honorarium payment
was made but so far this has not been
provided. The Union and the GSA are
working together on the quest to find
out what the hell has happened over
the past few months.
Well done for reaching the end of the
article.
