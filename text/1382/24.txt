Cleaning up fashion
I
t’s challenging to live an ethical
lifestyle, ethical clothing and
fashion don’t necessarily go to-
gether. Most people don’t want
to buy clothing made in a sweat-
shop. But that doesn’t mean they want
to spend £100 on a hemp and organic
cotton sweater. It’s difficult to find
ethical clothes that are fashionable and
leave you enough cash to eat.
Despite growing demand for ethical
clothing, high street shops pay their
factory workers pittance. However
they’re happy to give £3 Million to Kate
Moss for ripping off the clothes in her
wardrobe. It seems naive to blame Kate
Moss for the pittance factory workers
get paid, however she is a symptom of
how little companies value branding
their clothes sweatshop-free.
It’s true, that were Kate Moss and
all the CEOs, to decrease their wages
and increase the wages of their work-
ers, the world might be a happier place.
But there doesn’t seem to be any will to
do this. It’s easy for clothing companies
themselves to pass their responsibility
to the governments of the countries
they produce in.
Some companies claim that they’re
being ethical by paying the minimum
wage in the country they produce in.
However globalisation pressurises
countries to reduce the minimum
wage to below the living wage level.
If they don’t decrease their wages, the
companies go elsewhere. They have a
choice; wages that keep people locked
into poverty, or unemployment. The
country with the best exchange rate,
and the lowest standards wins. If wag-
es were raised above the market rate,
then it would be a distortion of the free
market. But poverty isn’t something
the market should compete on. Ideally
every country should have the living
wage as it’s minimum wage, but this is
unlikely to be enforced in reality.
If companies were to raise the wages
of their factory workers higher than the
market rate, they’d have to decrease
wages elsewhere or raise the price of
their clothes and be less competitive.
But if the will is there, it is possible
to pay a fair wage and make a profit, as
proved by American Apparel. A sweat-
shop-free, vertically-integrated com-
pany, American Apparel sells Ameri-
can style basics like T-shirts at decent
prices. Because American Apparel is
vertically-integrated, with factories
located in Los Angeles near the main
corporate building, it’s easy to monitor
standards for garment workers.
Since most multinational companies
outsource to factories across the world,
it’s difficult to monitor how much
workers are actually being paid and
working standards in their factories.
The problem doesn’t just lie with the
companies not paying higher wages to
factories. Many factory owners earn a
comfortable amount while their work-
ers struggle with a below-living wage.
Some factories keep two wage-books,
one shown to companies inspectors,
and one with workers actual wages.
Others keep workers overtime and
then refuse to pay them.
The workers are often in a desper-
ate situation and are forced to accept
below-living wages because of their
circumstances. Any attempts to form
unions usually result in being fired
from jobs which these workers are de-
pendent on.
Maybe it’s just a case of consumer de-
mand. As people become more aware
of the conditions facing clothing facto-
ry workers, perhaps demand will grow
for sweatshop-free clothes. At present
most ethical clothing brands charge
a premium for being sweatshop-free.
When there’s a choice between an ethi-
cal pair of jeans costing £100 by Edun
(Bono’s ethical clothing range), and a
pair of high street jeans costing £30, a
lot of people can’t afford to be ethical.
With Jane Shepherdson (the archi-
tect of the rise of Topshop) joining the
ethical brand People Tree maybe ethi-
cal brands will start getting a bit more
market-friendly. Whilst People Tree’s
ethical policy is great, the collections
are static and look like something a
traveller (not tourist) who follows a
macrobiotic diet would wear. There’s
a growing gap in the market for af-
fordable, fashionable sweatshop-free
clothes, waiting to be exploited.
