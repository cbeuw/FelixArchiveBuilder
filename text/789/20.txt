Undergraduate grants for London
students will rise from £2330 to
£2425 and postgraduate grants from
£3492 to £3630.
The threshold for parental incomes,
and the points on the contribution
scale at which the contribution
changes, will be uprated on average
by about 6.5%. Parents whose
residual income is below £9900 will
not be assessed for a contribution.
The minimum contribution will rise
from £40 to £50.
Union Welfare Officer Pippa
Salmon said yesterday that 'in view
of the fact that housing prices in the
South East have gone up by 20% this
year and rents accordingly, this
increase is laughably small for
Imperial students'.
Union President Ian Howgate was
also quick to condemn such a small
increase. He said, 'my personal
feeling is that 4% is obviously
insufficent. The instalment of the cut
in Housing Benefit in April means
that they are instigating the student
loan system already.' He went on to
call for a co-ordinated national
campaign by students. 'We need a
national union which operates
properly but unfortunately we don't
have one of those,' he said. 'At the
moment we can't fight the Thatcherite
government without proper
coordination.'
FELIX carried out a straw poll in
the Union Building yesterday and
couldn't find one student who was
satisfied with the increase. Most
people we asked thought that 4% was
'dreadful' and that most new students
next year would certainly have to rely
on top up loans. ,

Central Stores to close
College administration has announced
that they plan to re-organise the
College Central Stores. The present
stores will continue to organise
storage, delivery and collection of gas
cylinders, and purchase and storage
of cleaning materials. The stationery
stores will be moved to Sherfield and
all scientific consumables will be de-
centralised. The stores staff have
argued that this is effectively closing
the Stores from August 1 this year.
John Smith, in a circulated letter,
claims that 'these changes are
expected to make savings on staff
costs, space, vehicle cost and
maintenance, and the reduction of
stocks held centrally'. However, the
Stores staff say that only Central
Finance will save money as the
expense is shifted from Central
Administration' to the departments.
They believe that College stocks will
have to increase overall, rather than
being reduced, if sixteen de-
centralised stores are set up and
therefore the space needed to store
these items will increase.
Mr Smith has also assured all
Central Stores staff that they will be
'offered alternative work within the
College'. Both the staff and their
union representatives from IC
NALGO believe that nine jobs will be
lost as a result as technicians and
handlers are persuaded to take
voluntary redundancy.
The staff feelings are running very
high at the moment. They believe that
administration have not treated them
fairly and have let the Central Stores
run down over the last ten years. They
argue that great savings can be made
through central ordering and Stores
modernisation which has been
rejected by administration.
There is a joint purchasing power
of £'/2 million and Requisitions
believe that they can save £50,000 a
year through centralised bulk
purchasing from the right suppliers.
This 'could wipe out the £3m deficit'
rather than trying to skimp on a few
jobs. The discounts are much less for
small purchases.
Mr Terry Neville, who has the
overall responsibility for Central
Stores, told FELIX yesterday that
departments had 'voted with there
feet' over the last few years. He
believes that departments can demand
the same discounts as the present
central service. He is confident that
many suppliers are willing to deliver
to individual departments at short
notice. He told us that 'departments
can get most supplies cheaper
elsewhere any way'. He believes that
this plan is ideal because it cuts
staffing costs and each department can
cater for its own specialist needs. He
said that the response has been 'quite
positive so far' from departments and
he expects savings to be in the order
of £100,000. As far as job losses were
concerned he said that 'no pressure
has been put on staff to take
redundancy'.
NALGO representative Janice
Lewis is arranging a campaign to save
Central Stores to start next Monday.
She is angry that the College
administration have no concrete
arguments for their decision. She is
also concerned about the lack of
consultation between the staff,
administration and the departments
which will have to take on their own
purchasing and supplies; she believes
that 'it clearly hasn't been thought
through properly'. Other staff believe
the plan to be 'short-sighted' and
'naive'.
The NALGO campaign will consist
of posters, lobbying for departmental
support and a petition which all
students are invited to sign. The staff
have already made representations to
the Rector.
If you wish to sign the petition,
Central Stores staff have given
FELIX a copy which students can
sign.
Meanwhile 1200 items are out of
stock in Central Stores due to the
breakdown of computers in Sherfield
at the beginning of December.
LRT rise
From January 10 London Regional
Transport has operated its increased
fares which once again will hit
students' pockets. A two zone ticket
will now cost 80p (previously 70p)
and a three zone ticket increased to
£1.10 (£1 before). However travel on
bus or tube in the central zone
remains the same at 50p. Travelcards
have gone up by 30p to £2 and all
zone Capitalcards now cost £2.60.
