1988 is going to be a terrible year for
the nuclear industry. At the end of last
year this column reported that studies
of the survivors from Hiroshima and
Nagasaki had shown higher than
expected incidences of cancer, forty
years after the bombings (latest news:
New Scientist 7th January 1988 p46).
The first few weeks of the new year
have already seen worse news.
A horrific study of the effects of
fallout from Chernobyl on American
mortality rates is about to be
published (see The Independent 4th
January pi4). The main conclusion of
the report is that radiation kills many
people in the short term by indirect
means (this is in addition to the long
term risks of death from cancer).
The results come from a statistical
comparison of the state-by-state
mortality figures and the measured
amounts of fall out in each area. Small
doses of fall out are normally difficult
to measure, but the report found a
clever way to make reliable
comparisons. Iodine-131 is a common
radioactive component of fallout, and
iodine is concentrated in cow's milk.
Measurements of the amounts in milk
are routine and they give a reliable
indication of the amount of fall out in
the area where the cows graze.
Between May and August 1986 (the
three months following the reactor's
explosion) the death rate showed an
unexpected glitch. Normally about
650,000 people die during these
months in the USA. After Chernobyl
about 690,000 people died, that is,
about 40,000 (forty-thousand) more
than expected. The result is
significant because the figures have
shown remarkable stability since the
beginning of the century: such a large
glitch is completely unprecedented.
Normally the figures would be
regarded as a meaningless
coincidence because the actual
radiation doses are so small. Such
small doses were previously thought
to cause only marginal increases in
death rates (from cancer) and these
would not show up for decades. But,
the measured radiation doses in milk
occur in the same states as the
unexpectedly large body counts.
States with low doses of Chernobyl's
muck show normal death rates. So,
they cannot be ignored as a quirk of

the Grim Reaper.
However, 40,000 Americans did
not kick the bucket from radiation
poisoning, or indeed from anything
that is normally connected with
radiation. The theory that is gaining
popularity is this: the most easily
radiation-damaged part of the body is
the immune system; even small doses
of radioactive nasties cause small
decreases in the body's ability to fight
off nasty invaders; so if people are ill
a small increase in the radiation dose
may be enough to make the difference
between survival and death.
So we have to take the figures with
a pinch of salt: most of the people
who died were probably not healthy
fit individuals who were suddenly
struck down by Russian fallout. Most
were ill people who were just tipped
over the edge by the small decrease
in their ability to kill bugs. It is
meaningless to say that any specific
individual died because of the fallout;
the effect only becomes obvious in
large populations. Nevertheless, no
one ever imagined that such small
doses of radiation could cause such
a large secondary effect.
The number of deaths caused by the
disaster is likely to be very much
larger than anyone thought likely at
the time (if the results are confirmed
in European work). The study is
reminiscent of the one that showed a
small, but perceptible correllation
between exposure of pregnant women
to X-rays and deformed babies. That
report led to tight restrictions on the
use of X-rays in medicine. It is, as
yet, impossible to say what will
happen as a result of the latest figures,
but it isn't going to be good for the
nuclear industry, civil or military.
In twenty years time we may be
thankful for Chernobyl. It may prove
to be the only thing that will convince
us just how dangerous our nuclear
playthings are. We have to learn that
lesson now and start to look for safer
ways of defending ourselves and
keeping our light bulbs glowing.

Chemical warfare is banned under the
Geneva Convention. But the Geneva
Convention convention only applies
to people. This leaves the world's
chemical companies free to engage in
a continuous and fearsomely nasty
war against creepy-crawlies.
The big problem in this war is
selectivity: we could kill our insect
enemies with the same things we are
not allowed to use on our human
enemies (phosgene, chlorine, taubin,
hydrogen cyanide...), but we would
kill lots of friendly people as well, and
this is considered rather
counterproductive by the agricultural
profession (though it might just solve
some of the EEC's problems with
farming subsidies).
The first big breakthrough was the
discovery of DDT. It killed almost
anything with too many legs and
proved to be nearly harmless to
people. Unfortunately, it is really
inert chemically and so sticks around
in the environment, enabling resistant
strains of insect to develop. Also, it
kills birds and fish, which we would
rather kill by other means so we can
eat them.
Pyrethroids were the next really big
breakthrough. Some British
government chemists borrowed the
basic chemicals from some plants who
had been engaged in their own war
against insects for eons, and then
improved them to make them more
effective. They are much more
selective than DDT: you can spray a
room with them killing all the flies but
not your pet cat. The lethal doses are
small and the compounds do not
accumulate like DDT. But, they are
still rather unselective among insects
and are not wholly harmless to the pet
fish.
Newer and better chemicals are on
the way, but it will always be
extremely difficult to find a chemical
weapon that kills just one type of
insect selectively. Ideally we want a
chemical that can be used to kill things
that eat crops, but not useful insects,
such as honeybees and crop
pollinators. However, a bit of lateral
thinking has just produced some
spectacular and completely specific
results in Egypt.
Their particular problem involves
killing Cotton Leaf Worm (which
destroys cotton crops) without killing
Honeybees (which produce a valuable
crop in their own right). The trick that
produces specific results, is to use the
insects own sex pheromones against
it. Pheromones are the chemicals
insects use to find each other when
they are randy and want to start a
family (in this case female
pheromones attract the male insects).
They are completely insect specific
(after all God does not want to
encourage unnatural acts between
different types of insect, does he?).
Chemists can identify and reproduce
the pheromones in large quantities.
The first attempt to control the
insects involved using the
pheromones to attract male insects
into a trap. However, this failed
because the small number of males
avoiding the traps were enough to
keep the population going. After an
amazing lateral thinking leap, the
scientists tried a better method that
worked: they saturated the cotton crop
with the pheromone. This,
presumably, drove the male flies into
an orgy of randyness, but. more
importantly, left them completely
unable to find the females (not so
much because the small amount of
female scent was drowned by the
artificial variety, making it impossible
for the males to smell out the
females).
This, of course, left the population
devastated after one generation. More
importantly, it had no effect on the
bees (or any other insects for that
matter), thus producing a bumper
honey harvest.
The side-effects of DDT left
chemistry with a tarnished image, but
these latest developments show that
Chemists may be near to redeeming
themselves. A healthy respect for the
balance of nature is not, after all,
incompatible with the chemical
industry.
