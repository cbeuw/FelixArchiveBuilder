Fatal Attraction
New York attorney Dan Gallagher is
happily married. However, when
wife and daughter are out of town, he
has a passionate affair with Alex
Forrest, an unmarried publishing
executive. For Dan, this is a
whirlwind thing—intense but
shortlived. However Alex wants
more.
After the heap of excrement that
was the designer S & M of 9'A
Weeks, Adrian Lyne now tries his
hand at designer psychopathology and
the result isn't much better than his
previous work. In this film, culture
is a fondness of Madame Butterfly,
and style amounts to expensive
clothes, famous locations and flashy
editing. At one point, we cut back so
often to Alex's seemingly lifeless
body in a bath that you just can't not
know that she's going to rise up."
Much has been made out of the
steamy scenes between Alex and Dan,
but Fatal Attraction is actually quite
conservative. Dan and Alex may have
sex in a kitchen sink, but the big
message of the film is 'don't stray
from the path'.
Fatal Attraction seems to me to be
yet another addition to the yuppies-
in-peril catalogue of films. However,
it is also noticibly a product of the
post-AIDS sexual climate. Alex,
excellently played by Glenn Close,
rapidly loses her character, becoming
a vengeful rampaging psychopath.
Dan's part in the affair, and therefore
what should be his share of the blame,
is quickly forgotten in a knock down,
drag out fight. Alex, it is made clear
from the start, is bad news—you are
beaten over the head with this. Alex
is overtly sexy—Dan's wife plain, just
pretty. Alex's loft is barren, bleak,
filmed in colourless tones. Dan's flat
is homely clutter, filmed in warm
inviting colours. And if the audience
still doesn't get the message, Alex's
loft is pointedly set in the meat-
packing district of the city. The poor
woman never stood a chance.
What at first seems to start as an
intelligent film about adultery soon
becomes pretty objectionable in the
way it relies on an image of the
sexually independent single woman as
clinging and psychotic. Give Fatal
Attraction a miss—it's long, heavily
over-directed in places and ultimately
the male comes out on top yet again.

Near Dark
Near Dark is another contemporary
vampire story—vampires on the road,
in a way. Farm boy Caleb Cotton,
looking for excitement, takes a
strangely beautiful young woman,
Mae, for a ride in his truck. As dawn
approaches, she demands to be taken •
home and he insists on a kiss first. She
bites his neck and runs off. Since his
truck won't start Caleb has to walk
home—and the sun, when it rises,.
sears his flesh. And so"begins what
is probably the most off-beat vampire
movie since The Hunger. Near Dark
homes in on the hysterical violence
beneath a folksy surface, like David
Lynch's Blue Velvet. An innocent boy
is drawn by his desire for something
different into a sado-erotic nightmare
world, which threatens to destroy
him. And, as in Blue Velvet, Caleb
overcomes the monstrous vampire
family so that the good and normal
one can prevail.
Whereas Blue Velvet centres on its
young hero's fantasies, Near Dark
makes skillful use of the vampire
genre to give Caleb's battle for
survival a mythic dimension. The
vampires stand for Society's outcasts,
wandering the land wreaking unholy
vengeance: their battle scarred leader,
Jesse, sporting long rider coat and
pony tail, fought for the doomed
South in the civil war. His partner,
Diamond Back, was a wanderer.
'Young' Homer was a high school
misfit and the pathologically blood
thirsty Severen sports bikers jacket
and spurs.
The vampires are sometimes treated
with black humour (Jesse coughs up
a bullet and hands it back to the man
who just shot him with it) but never
are they glamourised: they are
unremittingly evil. The film also
manages to steer clear of a few cliches
such as the long fangs—but the
vampire mythology has also been
changed a little bit, to allow a blood
transfusion to cure the afflicted.
Despite this Near Dark is qutie close
to Bram Stoker's Dracula making
many of the latter's submerged
themes, especially the erotic
undertones, more explicit.
Caleb finds himself unable to kill
. his own victims and therefore has to
lead a parasitical existence off Mae.
And the scenes in which he drinks her
blood from her wrists are intensely
and disturbingly erotic. In other
words, vampirism is the ultimate
zipless sex.
Near Dark is almost as much a
Western as it is a vampire film. Caleb
engineers the escape of the vampires
from a police ambush—and is
rewarded by Severen giving him one
of his spurs. Later, when Caleb rides
out to confront the vampires he does
so on a horse. And the final battle has
a definite show-down feel to it.
Near Dark is a thoughtful film-
one of the few in the vampire genre
which actually raises the question of
whether or not it's nice to be a
vampire, and gives a real impression
of the difficulties involved in sucking
blood: T hate it when they don't
shave' complains Severen, just before
tucking in.
If you're in the mood for something
a bit off the wall, but not too much
so, Near Dark is probably your kind
of film.

The Woo-Woo Kid
A charming story of 'Sonny'
Wisecarver, a 15 year old who
became something of a national
celebrity in wartime America, after
becoming romantically entangled with
two married women, and
subsequently chased around the
country by the authorities and scandal
hungry press. The story is treated
with a light, rather glossy, Hollywood
style but is definitely amusing and
occasionally hilarious. The central
character, Sonny, was often
reminiscent of Woody Allen in his
bemused innocence, and the whole
film had a modest, unimposing
atmosphere rare to American cinema.

Predator
As one would expect, bulging biceps
and macho wise-cracks abound in
Predator, the latest production
starring Arnold 'intelligent
Schwarzenegger. Arnie, plus team of
seasoned mercenaries do battle with
a high-tech alien who seems to want
to kill anything warm-blooded he
comes across for no particular reason
whatsoever. Despite having some of
the deadliest man-portable artillery
you're ever likely to see, the men get
picked off one by one very much in
Alien style, but without the
imagination or subtlety of that film
However Predator is well produced
and, treated with the amount of
respect you might give an episode of
the A-Team, is good entertainment
and proffers a few laughs.

THEA THE
Ian McKellen Acting
Shakespeare
The Playouse, Adjacent to
Embankment Underground Station
This is probably one of the best one-
man shows that London has ever
seen—actor Ian McKellen takes his
audience on a tour of the life and plays
of William Shakespeare. He plays the
part of the playwright, as well as all
of his famous characters—and he does
it all without one change of costume.
McKellen switches from Prince Hal
to Hamlet to Polonius to Juliet with
awesome ease. His performance
inspires even the most unliterary in
his audience who have never even
heard of Shakespeare.
This is a must—it's a great night
out. The run has been extended to
January 30th and all proceeds go to
the London Lighthouse AIDS
hospice.
Students can get best available seats
immediately before the performance
at £5, one ticket per person, upon
presentation of your Union Card.
Monday to Thursday at 8pm
Friday to Saturday at 9pm
Firday and Saturday at 6.30pm
