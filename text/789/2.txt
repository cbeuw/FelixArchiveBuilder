Happy New Year to you all. Let's all
hope that 1988 will be ten times better
than 1987. Spring Term has always
been my favourite of the three. There
is a spate of annual dinners
throughout January and February
leading up to elections at the end of
the term. For first years, this annual
event is quite exciting. There's the
chance to stand for posts within your
own club or society. It should be
interesting to see just who puts
themselves forward for major Union
posts. It's about now that you should
have decided which post to stand for.
As the time gets nearer FELIX will
be carrying features on the sabbatical
elections, how to stand and how to
vote.
Linstead
What a shambles. The brief was for
Linstead to sell off any items which
had been left for years and were not
clearly marked. So why did they sell
recently left equipment, books,
records and clothes especially when
they were all marked? College should
reimburse all claimants immediately.
But this won't replace the treasured
items which were left in Linstead's
care and sold as forgotten items.
Grants
Bit by bit we're losing the war against
inflation with less money in students'
pockets again in 88. Student loans are
a thing of the future. FELIX has been
hard hit as more of the staff have to
supplement their incomes with casual
work. This must be true of all clubs.
The Union cannot distribute the
Welfare Handbook because they don't
believe that they have the forty or so
people needed to carry the operation
out. Nobody is prepared to do
anything for nothing nowadays. In the
sixties and seventies the Union had no
trouble in finding 'hacks' to help clear
up after parties, distribute leaflets or
organise campaigns. But now the
'hacks' ask: 'what's in it for me?'.
They all want posts to add to their
CVs but they don't want to do the
work which their job entails.
FELIX
It's a new year so why not come and
work on FELIX. We're always
looking for feature writers, news
researchers or just collators. We'd
love to have you here.
