ULU Welfare Handbooks, intended
for first year students in October, are
still collecting dust in the Union
Office. Union President Ian Howgate
and Union Welfare Officer Pippa
Salmon have blamed this on the
University of London Union who
produced it and apathy in the Union.
Last year's Union Welfare
Committee took the decision not to
produce 'But Were Afraid To Ask',
the ICU Welfare Handbook, but to
take 2000 copies of the new U L U
Welfare Handbook instead. These
were intended to be distributed at the
Freshers' Reception as 'But Were
Afraid To Ask' had been done
previously. However, the booklets
did not arrive until the third week of
the Autumn Term, too late for the
Reception, after a series of mix-ups
at the University of London Union.
Ms Salmon siad that the ideal
solution would be to get stickers and
names from Registry in order to
distribute the booklets to the
departments but she felt that there

would not be the support to help her
do this and that she did not have the
time to do this all herself.
Mr Howgate does not believe that
they are worth distributing at this late
stage and is particularly annoyed with
ULU. 'The Handbooks were 8-9
weeks late and they were definitely
not as good as But Were Afraid To
Ask.' He is not worried that first
years missed out on the welfare
literature this year because it was
well-covered in the ICU Handbook
which Ms Salmon edited.
Ms Salmon still hopes to persuade
departmental senior tutors to take on
the distribution but until then they will
be collecting the dust in the Union
Office. She said yesterday 'it's a great
shame that the first years didn't get
the Handbooks when they arrived,
when they probably needed them
most. Ian spent a lot of time chasing
ULU up about it. I don't think we
could have done anything else once
we were committed to the U L U
book'.
It is almost certain that the Welfare
Committee will decide to return to
'But Were Afraid To Ask' for the
coming year's intake.
0 R S awards
There will be 800 new Overseas
Research Students Awards this year
in the United Kingdom. They will be
offered on a competitive basis to
overseas postgraduate students of
outstanding merit and research
potential. Each award will cover the
difference between the tuition fee for
a home postgraduate and the full-cost
fee they would have been expected to
pay as an overseas postgraduate
student. Nine of these awards are
tenable at IC. Further information can
be obtained from the Scholarships
Office, Room 314, Sherfield
Building.
Obituary
Vernon Clancy MBE
Vernon St Clair Clancy has died aged
82. One of College's most
distinguished alumni, he was a
leading explosives expert and
investigator of bomb-induced aircraft
crashes, his most recent being into the
loss of the Air India Boeing 747 over
the Irish Sea in 1985. He leaves a wife
and two daughters.
Extra cash
The Union Snack Bar has been
seriously affected by the illness of
Manager Norman Jardine. There is a
severe shortage of casual workers
especially before midday and an
appeal has been made for any
students, who can spare a few hours
one morning and need extra cash, to
help out.
Smash V grab
The Union's Microcomputer Club
was broken into over the Christmas
period and several vital bits of
equipment were taken including a
BBC micro and a keyboard. The job
was not professionally done as the
door was broken open. Honorary
Secretary Chas Jackson believes it to
have been carried out by an
opportunist. This has put the Club out
of action.
Inter-Rail
JBritish Rail have decided to keep the
'price of their Inter-Rail card at the
same price as last year, despite their
recent price increases in Great
Britain. For £139, the card allows
travel throughout 20 European
countries and Morocco to all people
under 26. The price also includes
discounts of up to 50% on a choice
of cross-channel hovercraft and ferry
services.
Flowers urged
London University's trade unions
have urged former IC Rector and
current U L Vice Chancellor Lord
Flowers to attend the House of Lords
throughout the debating of the
Education Reform Bill. They believe
that Lord Flowers should take a high-
profile stand against the Bill and
represent the feelings of all academics
in the University.
Adventure
The first National Outdoor Pursuits
Exhibition opens on Thursday March
3 in Battersea Park, London for four
days. If you want to add a little
adventure to your dull, dull life then
;it's only £1.50 to students.
