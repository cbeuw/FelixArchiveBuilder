Before starting this week's article I
feel it necessary to reply to my critics.
To all the people I have either upset
or angered, it was never my intention
to and I do apologise. The comments
made have been noted and I shall
attempt to follow them.
I must make it clear that this
column is not an official communique
from the St Mary's Student Union,
merely the personal view of one
student (who tries to reflect typical
student life).
This month it has been pleasing to
see three students from St Mary's
playing in national rugby trials with
Kevin Simms (Wasps), a regular
England Centre returning to the team
playing the French at the Pare des
Princes in Paris. The other two
players—Sean O'Leary (also of
Wasps) and Richard Wintle (London
Welsh) playing second row and right
wing respectively, distinguished
themselves playing for the seconds
sides in the respective national trials.
It must be noted that all three do not
play for St Mary's regularly, only for
the special occasions which include
the Hospital's Cup and the annual
Cambridge University fixture.
Eligible to play for St Mary's are a
whole team of excellent players
regularly turning out for noted
London sides. One cannot for a
minute disagree with their decision to
gain deserved recognition by playing
for clubs that can offer a good fixture
list.
The problem is Catch 22. St Mary's
can no longer offer first class fixtures
to entice quality players, but on the
other hand in the new league system
one has to earn the right for first class
fixtures. Thus the problem cannot be
resolved due to the unusual situation
of a student team playing good rugby
of the time but never able to realise
the full potential of the talent
available.
What can be done has been
demonstrated with a string of victories
including Hospitals' Cups, 7-a-side
competitions and last year's win
against Cambridge University. Not
bad for a potential pool of only 250
male students, of which only x
h are
seriously interested in the game.
Rugby has, and will continue to
play a large part in the social strata
of life at St Mary's, and while it may
not be the sole reason for the outside
world to know of St Mary's and its
high standards it must be pretty close.

COOKERY
CLUB
Celery and ham
rollers
This is an extremely easy meal to
cook and is ideal as lunch or a late
supper. You can substitute asparagus
shoots for the celery hearts if you
prefer. I like the combination of the
hot cheese on the cold ham but others
like to bake the dish. The quantities
shown should give you a healthy meal
for one.
Ingredients
15g butter
Vi tbs. flour
V* pint milk
50g grated cheese
2 celery hearts, halved
(or asparagus shoots)
4 slices of ham
Method
Melt the butter and remove from the
heat. Add the flour and cook the roux
for 1 minute. Gradually stir in the
milk and bring it to the boil. Add most
of the cheese and season to taste.
Wrap each bit of celery in a slice
of ham and place it in a grill proof
dish. Pour the cheese sauce over the
ham and sprinkle the top with the
extra cheese. Grill until the top begins
to brown.
If the hot—cold combination does not
appeal to you then try baking at 180
deg C for 20 minutes before grilling.
Good appetite.
