recommended that March was the
best time to go to France because that
is when the snow is the thickest and
the pistes the clearest. March also has
the added advantage of longer
daylight hours so there's more time
on the precious slopes. That late in
the season the weather can be
relatively hot and ultraviolet rays are
in abundance. If you do go in March,
it is best to take a high factor sun
cream and lip protector.
f l o t h i n g
Once you have made the decision
where and when to go, there are
essential items of clothing which have
to be bought or borrowed. Good ski
clothing is very expensive so a first
time skier should try to borrow as
much as he/she can. This, in my
experience, is not the easiest of tasks.
Hardened skiers are reluctant to let
their clothing go on holiday without
them for fear of having their designer
salopettes ripped to shreds by an
inexperienced student. I ended up
having to buy most of the essential
items. This only applies to clothing.
It is best to hire skis, poles and boots
in the resort as they can fit everything
to you exact requirement.
When you buy your jacket make
sure that arm movement is not
restricted in any way. It will cost
around £60 for a good, well-insulated
jacket so buy one which you can wear
in London afterwards, just in case you
decide skiing is not for you. I tried
most of the well-known sports shops
in London before deciding on one
from C&A whose Rodeo Collection
is the best-selling make in Great
Britain. You will also need ski pants
or salopettes, which are high-waisted,
padded trousers that cover your
kidneys for added protection.
Salopettes are the best but make you
look very silly. Alternatively, you can
buy a ski suit. But you can't wear a
ski suit to College if you've decided
against skiing again.
The most important item to buy is
a pair of ski gloves. You can't get
away with the ones you usually wear
in London. One of the members of
my ski party thought that he could and
soon discovered how uncomfortable
it was to ski with freezing cold, wet
hands. You should make sure that the
ones you buy have leather palms and
a slight curl in the fingers. They
should go several inches beyond your
wrists so that any jacket will overlap
and no cold air will get to them.
You'll also need a ski-hat because a
large percentage of your body heat
escapes through the head. Remember
to pack ski sunglasses, several thick
ski socks and lots of thin polo neck
jumpers. Several thin layers are better
than one thick layer.
q u i p m e n t
When you finally make it to your
chosen resort you will have to hire
boots and skis. Skis should come up
to between shoulder and head height,
depending on your build. You should
check that there are no gouges in the
base and that the bindings are easy to
step into and release. The hire shop
will alter them to suit your height and
ability.
The most important item of your
equipment is your pair of boots.
You'll have a miserable holiday if
your feet are uncomfortable or cold.
Try walking around the shop for a
few minutes with the boots on before
accepting them and if you're
unhappy, change them.

One of my mistakes this Christmas
was to believe that I could go skiing
without first taking lessons. If you are
a first timer it is best to take a few
dry slope lessons in Britain before you
go. While the ones who believed they
could ski without doing this, spent the
holiday on their bottoms, the ones
who did, skiied off into the sunset.
Skiing holidays are much more fun if
you can stay upright for most of the
time. The ICU Ski Club organises
trips to a local dry ski slope most
weeks.
Some people chose to take lessons
at their resorts. These aren't cheap
and most foreign instructors have
difficulty explaining in English. If
you're unlucky you will end up
paying through the nose for an
arrogant fool who just-wants to show
how good a skier he is compared to
you.
x e r c i s e s
Many ski books will recommend
that you do a few exercises before
your holiday. This may be necessary
if you're an expert skier but I didn't
experience any aches or pains from
any of the gentle skiing I performed.
P r i c e
The advantage of the cut-throat
tactics of today's tour operators is that
skiing holidays are getting cheaper.
I have discovered recently that
Horizon have a special 'First Timer's'
six-day ski package to Austria. The
flight and accommodation for seven
days costs from £232-£347 depending
on the season and the First Timer's
pack an additional £146.50-£156.50.
When I visited Les Deux Alpes this
Christmas a six day ski pass cost £64,
lessons (12 hours total in groups of
ten) cost around £45 and ski and boot
hire £40.
C o n c l u s i o n s
Today's skiing technology is much
more sophisticated than a decade ago.
The boots are designed to protect your
ankles and, in so doing, make your
knees more vulnerable. The first
lesson to learn is how to fall without
hurting yourself. I didn't and missed
three days skiing with an injured
knee. The second lesson is how to
slow down and stop without falling
over.
I enjoyed my first skiing holiday
despite the falling over. I will, no
doubt, be gracing the slopes in the
future. I also found the whole
experience surprisingly relaxing. This
may have had something to do with
my lack of skiing, my excess of fresh
air and sun, and a severe case of over-
eating. It did have its downs (literally)
as well as its ups but I can thoroughly
recommend skiing as a wonderful
antidote to the academic blues.
