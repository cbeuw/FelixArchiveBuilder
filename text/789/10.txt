Skiing holidays are
becoming cheaper
and cheaper as cut
throat tour
operators tout for
business. They
combine sun, fresh
air, fantastic
scenery, physical
activity and apres-
ski to make a
thrilling antidote to
the academic blues.
Judith Hackney,
still limping
slightly, tells you
where and when to
go and whether it's
really worth all the
effort.
Before you decide to try skiing, you
ought to consider just how much the
holiday will cost you. You shouldn't
believe that the £200 odd you give the
tour operator will be your major
outlay. On top of flights and
accommodation there will be
equipment to hire, special clothing
and ski lift passes to buy, lessons to
arrange and over-the-top food and
drink prices to pay. Skiing holidays
don't come cheap if its yourfirsttime.
Inhere
The first decision you will have to
make is which country to visit. Each
has its own merits. Austria is said to
be the best for beginners, Germany
the most friendly and France the best
for all types of skiing terrain.
Austria is still the most popular
destination for Britain's first-time
skiers. Most of the resorts still
manage to keep the mountain village
atmosphere which seems preferable
to the well-designed pre-fabs that
adorn the French slopes. Cheap out-
of-season skiing is also good here
because life in these villages doesn't
stop when the holiday trade
disappears. Austria does have its
disadvantages: it has a high cost-of-
living which makes eating out
expensive and, because of its cosy
village life, there are very few self-
catering apartments. If you want good
apres-ski it is better to stick to the
well-known resorts of Innsbruck or
Kitzbuhel where this is especially
well-catered for.
Switzerland is out of the price range
of most of today's students. The
resorts are populated by the jet-set
who have been retreating slowly from
the other European towns as the
prices drop and the lower classes
infiltrate their apres-ski. You can
expect to pay at least another £100 on
top if you chose any Swiss resort.
The favourite family resorts are
situated in France. It was here that the
modern-style ski resort took shape,
with well-designed apartments and
good ski lift networks. Such resorts
as Les Deux Alpes and Val d'lsere
were built solely with skiing in mind.
Le Village complex in Les Deux
Alpes, where I spent a week over
Christmas, boasts skiing from the
doorstep with no long cable car rides
to endure. It also has snow nearby all
year round so it was one of the few
resorts this Christmas which could
offer skiing after the European thaw.
Most of the French holidays on
offer are for self-catering apartments
which cram up to six people, a
bathroom, a kitchen area and a lounge
area into a space no bigger than two
Southside rooms. It is important to
ensure that your group gets on well
together because there's no place to
hide.
Self-catering is the cheapest form
of living because all restaurants
charge steep prices in these obvious
tourist traps and, although
supermarket food is not cheap, it's far
cheaper than having to eat out every
n i g h t . '
There are other European skiing
destinations apart from the big three.
Italy is the next biggest although its
popularity seems to have declined
recently with its bad international
reputation. Package tours are
available to Spain, Andorra, Norway,
Bulgaria and Yugoslavia. There's
even Avimore in Scotland, but the
skiing and weather isn't as good as
the alps.

Second is the decision of when to
take your skiing trip. The obvious
dates of Christmas and Easter are
peak season and tend to be the most
expensive. The cheapest time is in
January or early March. Don't be
tempted to go before Christmas, even
though the fares are cheap because
most of the resorts facilities will not
have opened for the season. We went
over Christmas and found that the
advertised heated swimming pool was
still shut. Our tour guides
