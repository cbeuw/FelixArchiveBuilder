Angry students have discovered this month that most of their personal
possessions have been sold by the Linstead Hall Committee. The
mistake was discovered when two Canadian students from Montpelier
Hall came to collect items from the Linstead Hall basement where they
had left them for safe-keeping and discovered they were gone. Four
people have since come forward claiming that their possessions have
also disappeared.
Five years ago the Students Residence
Committee decided that the Linstead
Basement area would be the only area
in College where property could be
left for a long term period. Since then
moreand more items accummulated
and it was not obvious to whom they
belonged. At the beginning of this
academic year the Linstead Hall
Convenor Martin Whitfield suggested
that the area should be cleared and
any unwanted property sold. The Hall
Warden Richard Clarke was in favour
and the Hall Committee agreed to
help.
Three notices were put in FELIX
to announce the decision and
impending sale of any goods which
had not been clearly marked with
name and department.
The Basement was closed on 2nd
December and the Committee spent
three days sorting out what could and
could not be sold. Dr Clarke told
FELIX that anything which was not
marked was opened and if it was good
it was put aside for sale by auction.
He said that the whole operation was
monitored by the subwardens. It was
decided to donate all the clothes to
Oxfam as there were sufficient other
goods to make a sale worthwhile.
They also found three televisions,
three stereos, ski boots, a windsurfing
outfit, a computer and three bicycles.
The sale took place on the
following Saturday and made
£1123.935 with the proceeds being
split between the Hall and the RNLI.
Dr Clarke said that the Hall would be
using the money to finance the Hall's
20th birthday party in March.
It was shortly after this that people
started to realise that personal
possessions had also been sold,
including items from boxes which had
been marked with peoples' names and
departments. One women claims to
have lost £3000 worth of skiing
equipment while others have lost
records and important lab books.
Dr Clarke apologised for the losses
but said that it was 'inevitable with
such an exercise.' He has also
promised to examine each case and
has asked for all the students affected
to put their stories down in a letter.
Martin Whitfield, in a written
report, said that he believed that the
sale had been a great success and was
a long time in coming. He also wishes
to see such a sale held every year. He
writes, 'as with anything that is done,
some people will get hurt and lose
some of their possessions. But the sort
out of the basement occured with
every reasonable effort being taken to
locate the owners of most of the
valuable items. If any article was not
properly labelled, i.e. Name,
department, year it was left, date of
collection, it was then opened. If it
was obvious that the total worth of the
articles was high then their name
would be checked against the College
list and if the name didn't appear, the
articles were then sold or thrown out.
In my opinion if the people who did
lose belongings in the sale had taken
more care of their possessions in the
first place, they wouldn't now have
lost them. Hopefully it will teach
them that if they can't be bothered to
even label them properly, why should
the Hall look after them, when all they
are doing is cluttering up the Hall's
basement which is to be used
primarily for the Hall's residents and
not as a potential fire hazard which
it was before the clear out was
started.'
The Union is to take up the cause
of the students who have lost their
possessions. President Ian Howgate
has described the situation as 'a
complete mess'. He said yesterday
that the whole thing is a shambles,
because proper records had not been
kept of the items in the basement by
Linstead Hall security. They have a
list of names and departments of
people who have gained entry to the
basement in the last five years, but
they are concerned that students were
not informed by security that they
should put name,'department and date
to be collected on any boxes left there.
College administration have stated
that College will not be held liable,
which means that people who have
lost items will not be reimbursed.
However, the Union is trying to
compile a list of people whose
possessions have been sold.
