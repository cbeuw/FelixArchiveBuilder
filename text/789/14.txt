MUSIC
by Phil Young
Hi! A belated welcome to 1988 from
the all-new FELIX music column,
bringing you previews and reviews of
gigs and recrods, concentrating on
non-mainstream music—those not in
favour can go and listen to BBC
Radio. Recovering from the
traditional Christmas gig wilderness,
the London live scene starts tonight!
For those of you not going to see
Buday Curtess tonight at College, you
could try the Boogie Brothers at
Dingwall's, Camden at 8pm (£5). For
vibrant blues and soul complete with
pork pie hats and shades. If you miss
them you can see them on Sunday at
9pm for £4 at the Half Moon, Putney.
If your appetite was whetted by
Howlin' Wilf & the Vee Jays at
College last term, you can see them
at the Dublin Castle in Camden
tonight at 8.30pm for £3, or
tomorrow at the King's Head, Fulham
High Street, at 8pm for £3. Punk fans
can see Chelsea—remember them?—
tonight at the Marquee in Wardour
Street, Soho at 7pm for £3.50, and
devotees of the speed poet John
Cooper Clarke can see him in action
at the Cricketer's, by the Oval at 8pm
for £3. Marillion fans can try and buy
a ticket from the touts to see them at
Hammersmith Odeon between
Saturday and Tuesday.
Gig of the week has to be Pop Will
Eat Itself'at ULU tonight at 7.30pm,
£4.50 on the door, for a night of sexist
hip-hop grebols doing self-indulgent
thrash and parody.
On Saturday 23rd, The Triffids play
the Astoria and Echo and the
Bunnymen play Brixton Academy,
Eric Clapton appears on January
25-27, 29-31 at the Albert Hall.
Definitely worth missing are the
Alarm on February 9 at Hammersmith
Odeon.
Gig of the week: self-indulgent Pop Will Eat Itself at ULU tonight
A l b u m review:
The Smiths—Strangeways here we come
Deterred from buying this one
because of the lousy music press
reviews, I find this album distinctive
from previous Smiths' material. A
noticable lack of Morrissey one-liners
is countered by a stronger
instrumental input. Don't be put off
by the single 'Girlfriend in a Coma'.
Gems like 'Stop Me If You've Heard
This One Before' and 'Last Night I
Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me'
put this album amongst their best.
FOOTBALL
by Adrian Grainger
A week after the FA Cup third round,
London's teams return to the league
trail with some exciting matches in
prospect:
All matches are on Saturday
January 16th with 3pm kick-offs.
Queens Park Rangers v West Ham
Division 1, Loftus Road,
Shepherds Bush (tube)
A clash between the hooped Rangers
and the pride of East London is
mouth-watering. QPR have faltered
lately but are still a force with new
signing Mark Falco settling in well,
scoring two FA Cup goals last week.
West Ham have had their problems
this year v.'th injuries to key men like
Alviu Martin, but after a cup victory
over Charlton last week, a draw
seems likely. Watch out for the skills
of Liam Brady whose curling free
kick goal last week was superb. Go
along to see football on plastic, its the
last season at Loftus Road.
Tottenham v Coventry
Division 1, White Hart Lane,
Seven Sisters (tube).
The obvious comparisons will be
made with this being the repeat of last
year's FA Cup Final. This match
though should be a reverse of that
May result, a classic match is
unlikely. Terry Venables is slowly
forming Spurs into a winning side
with an impressive cup win at Oldham
under his belt. Clive Allen seems also
to have returned to form. Coventry
are struggling near the foot of the
table and are finding it tough to live
as cup winners. Regis is playing well
though with memories of his great
days at WBA. The walk from the tube
is 25 minutes long, so I would wait
for a better match than this to see.
Wimbledon v Watford
Division 1, Plough Lane,
Wimbledon Park (tube).
Wimbledon are 'on a roller' with six
straight wins including a demolition
of WBA last week. John Fashanu,
Vinny Jones and other part-time
players have made the Dons a strong
rorce, not given enough credit for
their achievements. They are my top
for the cup this year. Watford are a
poor side with recent turmoil about
their ownership not helping their
league position. New man Steve
Harrison has problems indeed. They
struggled in the Cup and should
receive a lesson or two in this match.
Crystal Palace v Huddersfield
Division 2, Selhurst Park,
Norwood Junction (BR)
Palace are playing very well and I
think that they are a good bet for
promotion. I saw them demolish
Plymouth 5-1 and their rhyming and
roaming strikers Bright and Wright
(37 goals between them this season)
being devastating. Huddersfield have
new manager Malcolm MacDonald
but are still smarting from their 0-1
defeat at Manchester City. Palace
should take the 3 points without
breaking into a gallop.
Millwall v Middlesborough
Division 2, The Den,
New Cross (tube)
Although this is the match of the day
in the second division, I would keep
well clear. I saw Millwall at West
Ham and their bad reputation with
their fans is justified. There were 40
arrests at Arsenal in the cup last week
as well. Tony Cascarino is Millwall's
best player, a fighting 17 goal striker.
Middlesborough were top but
haved dropped back lately and could
only draw with non-league Sutton last
week. 17 goal Slaven is their star
striker. Millwall might just sneak it.
Fulham v Port Vale
Division 3, Craven Cottage,
Putney Bridge (tube)
This doesn't seem on paper a very
exciting game, but you never know.
Fulham are a decent side and Terry
McCann will always stick with them.
18 goal Rosenior is the key. The lads
from the potteries are near the foot
of the table. I saw a game at Vale Park
about 5 years ago and the atmosphere
of financial heartache and old
traditions was a saddening feeling.
Fulham should win.
Leyton Orient v Crewe
Division 4, Brisbane Road,
Leyton (tube)
The home team with their new name
are second in the league and deserve
to climb up a division. The East
London reds are in round four of the
FA Cup which may prove a
distraction though. Crewe are mid-
table, better than usual for them, and
have a good away record. Orient's
form should see them pull further
away with Wolves at the top
London game of the day:
QPR v West Ham.
Friday January 15th 1988 FELIX
