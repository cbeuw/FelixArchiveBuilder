Transport
A new van has been ordered to
replace the rather old and doddering
white van. For those of you who are
interested, it is to be a (socialist) red
13 seat crew bus.
Last term a considerable number of
people asked for Union van tests at
extremely short notice. As this causes
great inconvenience for the van testers
(who have to give up their
lunchtimes), there is now a Transport
Committee ruling that all van tests
should be notified at least one week
in advance. If you require a van test,
please think about it well in advance.
Insurance
Since the last edition of FELIX, the
following cheques have arrived:
Colrin Hunt
Gedney Takel
Kwok Niskier
Espejo Ivory
The lucky recipients can collect the
cheques from my office, but must
bring identification.
Also I need further information on
the following longstanding claims. It
would help considerably if the
claimants could see me as soon as
possible:
J Cooper
F Kateli
R McBryde
Noticeboards
The following is the list of
noticeboard allocations. I have cut
down on the space for each
club/society in order to fit everybody
in. I felt that this approach was much
fairer than denying clubs space
entirely, as the choice of
clubs/societies to be denied space
would be arbitrary and with more
basis in personal prejudice than a
detailed knowledge of individual
clubs/societies which I cannot be
expected to possess.

A Final Note
This is a term of hard work for
everybody. Just remember to get
some sleep and eat all your greens,
or you won't grow up big and healthy
(like Judith).

I hope everyone's recovered from
their holiday hangovers by now—and
perhaps your bank balance is also
slightly healthier.
While these matters are still fresh
in your mind, I would like to
introduce the Alcohol Awareness
Campaign. It's not a 'let's ban
alcohol' scheme, but it is intended to
encourage people to think about how
much they drink and why.
Alcohol is the major cause of death
in men aged between 18 and 24 and
did you know that if you drink 2l
h
pints of beer a day for two weks you
can put on three pounds of weight!
And of course it costs a fortune.
The Campaign will be concentrated
later on this term, probably the sixth
week. We'll be arranging things
between now and then, so if anybody
wants to lend a hand just send a note
to me at the Union Office or ring up
(internal 3500) and leave a message.
Better still, come to the next Welfare
Committee meeting on 26th January
at 12.45pm in the Union Office.
Thanks to those who sent apologies
for Tuesday's meeting and to the two
people who turned up!
