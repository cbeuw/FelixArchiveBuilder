I found Christmas really depressing
this year. The endless reunion parties
with old school friends who were still
drinking too much and smoking too
much. I think it depressed me because
I started to realise that I had somehow
grown away from the people I used
to hang around with. I no longer
wanted to party into the night, drink
too much or smoke too much. I put
this down to being Tmperialised',
though my old friends just said
'boring'.
I don't consider myself boring. It's
those eggheads that sit in the front
row and know all the right questions
to ask that are. I'm just more
confident than I used to be since
coming to university. I don't feel that
I have to pretend anymore when I go
to a party. I've never really liked them
all that much, or discos, come to that.
The parties of my formative years
consisted of spiked orange juices and
throwing up in the kitchen. I could
never understand why I let myself go
through that same old Friday night
ritual. I could sit for hours in the same
armchair, with a fixed grin and
obligatory gin & tonic, watching them
chatting up girls with nervous giggles
and 34a busts. I would feel my week-
long inhibitions floating away as the
wall fixtures began to rotate
mysteriously and I would have an
inexplicable urge to visit a bucket.
Discos are worse. One evening
over Christmas my best friend at
school and his latest girlfriend Sue
insisted that we should go to
'Grooving' in Hainsham. Sue
promised that this newly-opened
nightclub would make the ideal
evening out. So I spent the. evening
with my obligatory gin & tonic,
watching heaving, sweating bodies
gyrating mindlessly to mindless pop.
The charts are full this dross
nowadays. I suppose it's because the
only people who can afford to buy
singles in 88 are those that run the
damned discos. It only takes 20,000
sales and you've made it. Radio One
only makes it worse. I get really
irritated when I find myself singing
along to it. I don't want to. I've found
myself brainwashed by the
background music and the backside
chatter.
I must admit that Christmas wasn't
just a string of parties and family get
togethers. I did meet some people that
I hadn't seen since school. I was
shocked to discover how many of my
contemporaries had got engaged since
then, and one had been married for
five months! I'll soon be the only
bachelor in Hainsham. This doesn't
worry me that much because I intend
to make the most of being single.
I think the best thing that happened
to me at Christmas was EastEnders.
It's suddenly got really good again.
I've managed to miss both of this
week's episodes but I plan to catch
them on Sunday. We all think Lofty
will top himself. Let's hope we're
right.
