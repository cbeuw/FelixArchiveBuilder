Presenting the new, improved
FELIX music page: three bands,
two pictures and one new writer
Guy Riddihough who reports on
Wendy and the Rockets. Less
picturesque are Sad Among
Strangers who play tonight's Guy
Fawkes Party in the JCR and the
Comsat Angels who played an
excellent gig last Friday.
LIVE! Five Australians play rock'n'roll
Friday night was a classic night on the
telly; it began with the return of The Tube
where Tina Turner strutted her stuff to
Cat people, River Deep Mountain High
and her new single, PIL treated us to
Anarchy in the UK and two of their top
ten hits and the Eurhythmies dazzled
with three excellent new songs. It ended
late with Brando rebelling against 'what
you got' in The Wild One.
In between there was time to nip out
and catch the Comsat Angels who kept
standards consistently high with a
perky set and well deserved their two
encores. The band played just over an
hour in all and featured almost all of their
new album LAND. Mercifully they left
out the two weakest tracks and amped
up Worlds Away (a dodgy song on a l -
bum) with thundering bass. A s
mentioned last week the Comsat Angels
are a punk band turned pop and it Indep-
endence Day, a song featured on albums
from both styles, which showed where
their real strength lies.
Although songs like Will you stay to-
night?, Alicia and Island Heart are all
excellent chart-hit fodder and hence
very accessible and immediate live, the
brooding, more aggressive Total War
and Waiting for a Miracle (both from the
first album) sounded even better. Also
superb were Eye of the Lens and On the
Beach.

That's what I thought, too, but don't let
the name fool you. Expecting something
far worse, I was subjected to a healthy
does of Australian Rock'n'Roll (very
m u c h like the E n g l i s h c o m m o d i t y ) .
Wendy Stapleton, obviously a seasoned
stage performer, quickly won the hearts
of w h a t s e e m e d a s u s p i c i o u s l y
Australian audience. Dressed in her
(very tight) black leotard and with her
b l o n d e hair s h e p r e s e n t e d q u i t e a
charismatic force—backed up by a very
powerful voice. T h e t w o guitarists,
Adrian Dessent and Joe Amenta, took
turns with the proficient if somewhat
predictable solos. T h e bassist, Noel
Beare, stuck steadfastly to the root notes
of the appropriate chords, with the odd
expedition up to the third and fifths. The
percussionist, Steve Donald, was good
but arn't they all nowadays?
The set had the standard selection of
fast one, Tonight, the slow one, Telling
Me Lies, the drum solo, Make Up Your
Mind, the old single, Play the Game, the
new single, It Just Depends and the
album plug No Control. (While on the
subject, the album, Dazed for Days was
produced by John Hudson, who also
p r o d u c e d B u c k Fizz a n d Ultravox.)
About half way through the gig all the
lights went down and after one track in
torch light the rest of the evening was
spent under harsh f l u o r e s c e n t strip
lighting. It is some credit to the band that
they took this in their stride and played
well enough to get two curtain calls.
Although there was nothing new in the
material they presented, it w a s the
presentation that made the difference
b e t w e e n i n d i f f e r e n c e a n d a g o o d
evening's entertainment. They're young,
a n d if t h e y c a n avoi.d t o o m a n y
comparisons with Suzie Quatro, w h o
knows?
Sad Among Strangers
Asked to pen a few words on a dance band to whom he
provides services of a managerial nature, IC student Chris
Hendy proved to be pretty elusive. Then the epistle .arrived
explaining that it wasn't going to be similar to the rest of its
ilk. Not for him 'the type of crap y o u read in N M E everyday'.
No, a list of testimonials from various dead giants of the
literary world i as impressive as the back cover of the latest
best-selling paperback, their validity never in question and
about as relevant to the music of SAD AMONG STRANGERS
as this opening paragraph.
A n d s o what about the music of Sad A m o n g Strangers?
Sad to say it's not so original and near to the edge of current
musical trends to defy description, comparison or berating.
O n the evidence of listening to a five-track cassette the Sads
repertoire is restricted to standard guitar-based tight funk-
prominent bass, lots of sounds like springs being uncoiled
and strangled vocals (I've been a zulu), whining vocals (How
good are you?) and best of ail vocoderised ones (Do the
lurch). Lyndon provides these vocals a n d the other members
are Steve (drums), Sig (keyboards), Pod (guitar) and-Reeri
(bass).
G u y Fawkes failed to go with a bang—will the Sads d o the
same? Since you'll probably g o to the party anyway who a m
I to spoil the surprise?
