Opinion
NUH THE CASE FOR REAFFILIATION
No one but the longest serving
postgraduate in Imperial College
will remember being in member-
ship of the National Union of
Students. For that reason alone it is
worth considering a revote on NUS
membership. The entire generation
who voted us out have now passed
on. In the student handbook NUS
gets only a perfunctory mention
but a number of basic reasons are
given as to whv we left NUS. I
believe that all of these reasons have
now been overtaken by events and
reforms in the National Union of
Students and not only should you
consider joining NUS but that
when the vote comes up that vote
should be for membership.
They said, when you left, that
NUS was too bureaucratic. Since
then it has reduced the size of its
staff and now has only 70 staff
members, less than many big
universities students unions, to
service the memberhip of 750
student unions and 1.4m students.
Amongst those staff over three
quarters of them work on research,
campaigning, regional representa-
tion to local government and
communications. The National
Union of Students has moved its
headquarters from the centre of
London and has recently imposed
cuts on its internal budgets of
£220,000 from a budget of £ 1.4m.
NUS has disposed of the large
commercial empire which it had
built up, although it keeps a strong
involvement in all areas of com-
mercial services to students. It now
concentrates on influencing com-
pany policies and negotiating deals
rather than adventures into busi-
ness on its own. It now believes that
the most effective role it can play is
the coordination of the massive
purchasing power of students in
this country. Students unions alone
have a turnover in excess of £60m
and the purchasing power of
students as a whole exceeds
£ 1,000m. The parallels between the
collective influence in commercial
services and working collectively
for political gain should be obvious
to anyone with common sense.
The second reason given for
dissafiliation was that NUS was
'undemocratic'. Since you left the
National Union we have imple-
mented 'compulsory cross campus
secret ballots' in which every
student has the right to stand and
every student has the right to vote
for delegates to each of the two
national conferences that are held
each year. The national confer-
ences, which were a major bone of
contention, have also been re-
formed. Over £80,000 worth of
savings have been made on the
conference budget and NUS has
abolished its January meetings
altogether. The whole emphasis has
been shifted away from gladitorial
political battles to make the
conferences a working exchange of
ideas and information between
student union officers. NUS also

NUS President Neil Stewart
has a complicated system of
proportional representafion on its
national executive which guaran-
tees any group with a sixth of the
votes at least one person on the
executive, any group with one fifth
of the votes at least two people and
any group with a quarter of the
votes at least three and possibly
four representatives. While still
guaranteeing that the majority on
the executive will be fully com-
mitted to union policies. NUS is
now led by Labour students who,
whatever your opinion of their
political views, are a recognisable
national force.
Thirdly we are told that NUS was
far too expensive. It is hard to
imagine what criteria this was
judged. Membership of NUS is not
paid from the pockets of individual
students but from student union
money provided by the college
authorities. NUS has recently
changed its subscriptions system to
guarantee that if the money to
individual student unions goes
down then the NUS subscription
will go down. And this year many
colleges have in fact . had re-
ductions. Although the affiliation
as a block represents thousands of
pounds when that is divided by the
number of students it works out at
no more than £4 or £5 a head. And
when you realise that even these
sums of money represent less than
six or seven percent of the Imperial
College Student Union budget it is
not unreasonable to spend that sum
of money when our student grants,
our travel awards and increasingly '
the future of our courses and
colleges are taken 100% at national
level. Indeed NUS' campaign to
protect travel awards will have
saved the majority of Imperial
students well over £100 in travel
expenses in London last yearalone.
Lancaster University recently
did an audit of the benefit to their
iFriday, 4 November, 1983
students of the work done by NUS.
Here are some of the examples. In
1981 the NUS intervention with Dr
Rhodes Boyson saved Lancaster
University at least £50,000 each
year on its student union budget.
Secondly on housing benefit be-
cause NUS managed to get eligi-
bility extended to students on
campus they benefited to a tune of
over £30,000. While off campus
students were getting an extra
£50,000 due to rate rebates arising
from national work done by NUS.
And if test cases being pushed by
NUS for eligibility during vacation
wins then students at Lancaster will
be able to claim a further £90,000 a
year in vacation rent. The DES
plan to limit travel expenses would
have cost Lancaster students over
£80,000 a year and the legal
precedents set by House of Lords
Judgement earlier this year meant
that overseas students in Lancaster
received refunds of over £120,000
and if the follow up legal action by
NUS is successful a further
£ 150,000 will have to be paid out to
' students who were overcharged.
They even give an example of how
NUS made £600 worth of legal fees
available to take up a test case on
behalf of an individual student who
ultimately received a settlement
worth £8,000 and if we remember
that students here at Imperial
received grants which total well
over £7m we begin to realise the
scale on which the NUS operates
and put its subscriptions in some
sort of perspective. At a rough
euess. since Lancaster has only
4,000 students, it is likely, given that
rents are higher in London, you
have more overseas students at
Imperial and that travel costs are
immensely higher in the London
area that all those figures could
apply equally to Imperial College
and would be very likely to be much
higher.
Although you are able to get
many of the benefits of NUS
without actually being in member-
ship. You should at least have the
honesty to admit that those benefits
depend on the work of the National
Union and the detailed advice it can
give individual student unions on
how to ensure that their students
have those benefits. The truth is
that a great deal of your welfare
work is based on research and work
done by NUS which you manage to
get through other channels, such as
the University of London Union.
The argument about how you
change NUS has clearly been won
by those people who decided to stay
in NUS and work from the inside.
Not only have they changed it but
at the same time they have
managed to defend a great many
student facilities and rights. Even
this Conservative government still
recognises NUS as the voice of
students and government ministers
and civil servants regularly meet
• NUS to discuss problems many of
which affect us. At the moment the
NUS view goes forward without a
democratic imput from Imperial
College. The weight and force of
arguments which you could bring
to bare on national discussion are
simply not there. All the promises
that were made by people who said
that Imperial should disaffiliate
from NUS, and that you would still
be able to speak to MPs and make
effective representation to govern-
ment ministers has simply not come
true.
The real question is one of
student unity. Student unions are
not trades unions and as a
breakaway you are not able to
exercise local industrial muscle.
The only thing that students have
got going for them is their
enormous numbers and their
ability to argue their case co-
herently. But those are only affec-
tive if we are coordinated by a
national organisation and if we
unite with students in other col-
leges. The NUS has demonstrated
in rounds of discussions on student
grants and in opposition to student
loans that when it coordinates
students effectively it can ^defeat
government proposals and change
the policies of all the political
parties. >
I think Imperial College should
have a referendum on NUS mem-
bership next term. Edinburgh
University executive have recom-
mended their students should con-
sider rejoining and the topic is up
for discussion in other disaffiliates.
But before you decide we ought to
have a series of informed debates
over several weeks involving NUS
speakers and those who disagree
with NUS, to hear all the argu-
ments. That can be the only basis
on which Imperial students make
up their own minds, hear of the
changes that have been made, and
hopefully decide to reaffiliate.
