VIOLENCE AT UNION PARTY
A young lady was very badly beaten up in the ladies toilets in
the Union Building after a party organised by the Latin-American
Society on Saturday 22 October.
Late on the evening of the
party students saw a man coming
down the east staircase covered in
blood and in a dishevelled
condition. On investigating the
ladies lavatories, they found the
young lady who appeared to be
quite seriously injured.
There was so much blood
splattered all over the toilets it
was initially thought that she had
been stabbed. However it was
later found that no weapon had
been used.
The man and woman had come
to the party together and had
apparently had a lovers' tiff. The
man later followed her into the
ladies toilets and beat her up.
The man returned to the party
where he behaved aggressively,
tnghtening people there. He was
held at the party until taken by
the police to Gerrard Rd police
station. He was released the next
morning when the woman, who
had spent the night in St Stephens
Hospital declined to press
charges against him.
Ms Christine Teller, ICU
Deputy President, has banned
Latin-American Society from
organising events in the Union
Building. However, neither of the
persons involved are at College,
and the man was restrained by
L a t i n - A m e r i c a n Society
members when they realised
something was wrong with him.
Latin American Society feel
they have been very badly treated
by Ms Teller.
The toilet in which the attack
occurred. Heavy bloodstains
can be seen on the walls and on
the floor.
NUS at IC Melanie Socks it to 'em!
The President of the National
Union of Students Mr Neil
Stewajt, will speak at I C U
U G M on Tuesday 8 November.
He has been invited by ICU
President Gaynor Lewis to talk
about the NUS and encourage
ICU to re-affiliate. The results of
the NUS survey which have been
circulated around College will
also be known on Tuesday.
The annual £13,000 affiliation
fee is generally felt to be more
than IC Union can afford. The
NUS has therefore proposed an
initial payment of £5,000 for the
first year, followed by £ 10,000 for
the second year and £13,000 for
the third year. However the
overall deficit of £8,000 would
have to be made up by ICU at a
later stage.
It is possible for IC students to
affiliate personally, by writing to
the NUS national office.

An impromptu concert was given on the steps of the Albert Hall on
Sunday night by Melanie, the American folk rock singer and star of
Woodstock '68.
She had been due to play in the Albert Hall the same night but the
concert was cancelled as not enough tickets were sold.
In an interview with FLEIX Melanie said, "I had to play, all the
publicity was still up, and I didn't want to disappoint anyone who had
turned up to see me." None of the 150 people listening seemed at all
disappointed.
