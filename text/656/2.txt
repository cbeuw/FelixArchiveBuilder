Letters H
Cover
Nonsense
Dear Pallab
I was surprised to see that the
cover of last week's careers
issue of FELIX portrayed a
German nazi officer pointing a
gun at a collection of unlikely-
looking job applicants. The
figure was also wearing an arm-
band which apparently read
Young Conservatives.
There are two main
objections to this portrayal: it
makes no sense eithei
politically or historically. You;
cartoonist, Guy Riddihough,
explained that he was trying to
represent the kind of treatment
often experienced at Job
Centres. The nazis were
responsible for unprovoked
aggression against neigh-
bouring countries and the
ultimate invasion and
subjugation of most of Europe,
torture and repression of
political opponents, the
destruction of many European
cities and industries, making
half of Europe's people into
homeless refugees, attempted
genocide, the looting of many
of Europe's art treasures, the
deaths of thousands upon
thousands of people, and other
atrocities. I know from
experience that our Job Centres
are not always perfect, but surely
they don't mete out this sort of
treatment. The naivety of the car-
toon's attempted message is fur-
ther compounded by the fact that
the Nazis were able to win sup-
port from the German people be-
fore the war by effectively elimin-
ating unemployment.
Second, the cartoon tries to
draw a parallel between the
Conservative Party and hence
the present government's
policies, and the nazis. Such a
link is clearly absurd and causes
grave offence to those of us who
hold Conservative views.
Accusing the present govern-
ment of fascist policies, as has
become common among u the
extreme left, shows eit ler a
total ignorance of the meaning
of fascism or a deliberate mis-
use of the word as an insult. I
would not have expected
FELIX to have tried to draw
such a parallel for either reason.
Mr Riddihough is clearly a
cartoonist with considerable
artistic talent. However, I
would suggest that if he intends
to continue to draw political
cartoons he first makes some
attempt to understand the
political implications of what
he is drawing. As for you,
(Letters-to-fhe-I^iW.
Pallab you ought to know
better.

Sports Drivel
Dear Pallab
Is FELIX the newspaper of
Imperial College Union?
Or, perhaps, is it being used
as a once weekly exposition of
the regular few?
I refer to the sports page in
the issue dated 21 October. For
once, one of the College clubs
sought to contact the masses of
Imperial in the most effect way
possible. The message was a
sincere plea for the table tennis
players from last season who
could spare the odd evening to
help the club out, to come
forward.
Was this plea printed? No!!
Instead, the sports page had a
remarkably familiar appear-
ance; indeed apart from the
absence of a Sailing Club report
could have been taken from any
one of last year's issues! In
places where the plea could
have been printed were
paragraphs of utter drivel
which probably meant nothing
to the club members, let alone
the average reader (I refer to the
Badminton report especially).

PG Supervision
Dear Pallab
I am writing to add a
postscript to Chris Hendy's
article about postgraduate
courses in the Careers FELIX.
He dealt in some detail with the
financial side of PG education
but did not mention super-
vision.
What sort of person is the
prospective supervisor? Do you
get on with him well enough to
build up a satisfactory working
relationship—one that will
stand the stress of experimental
setbacks and of the long grind
of writing up? Has he got your
project planned down to the last
detail, or are you to be given a
vague working title—little more
than a frarnework for a test of
initiative? What sort of person
are you and what sort of
supervision suits you
best—would your supervisor
provide it?
These are some of the most
obvious points to be
considered. W'th luck the PG
Affairs Seminar in January will
provide an opportunity for
asking other, more general,
questions. In the meantime: go
and interview your prospective
supervisor!
Yours sincerely

Drunken
Ramblings
Dear Sir
I hope you will except the
views of an ex-student of IC on
the recent Commem Ball. To
' me it is the Grand Finale of
sheer hypocrisy that presides in
the governing bodies of
Imperial College. The pretence
of concern and appraisal for
students in an establishment
where the standard of lecturing
is appalling and the staff-
student communication is
absolutely minimal. The
appeasement of Union officers
year after year by the Rector in
their quest for better standards
of education is now a standing
joke among College hierarchy.
In my short time at another
university the difference is
clearly noticeable where
lecturers and staff seem almost
human, and prices in the bar are
not quite so extortionate. It
may well be that IC is unique in
this phenomenon, resting on
the laurels of a government
blessing and destroying the
fabric of a great Victorian
vision. _
Yours soberly

if it gets me in the shit.
After Our
Money
Dear Pallab
I was most surprised to hear
that Neil Stewart, NUS
President, has been invited to
speak at the next UGM. What
can he possibly hope to achieve?
The arguments against NUS
membership have not changed
in the last year. The real cost of
membership would be 15% of
ICU's disposable income; this
money would have to be found
from the CCUs and clubs and
societies, which would
undoubtably cause hardship for
many of these. And what
exactly do we get in return for
this huge outlay?
In fact, in 1979/80, over 90%
of NUS's income was spent on
bureaucracy, administration
and conferences. IC is big
enough to be able to provide the
welfare and other services that
might make NUS membership
attractive to smaller colleges
who cannot do so, and
duplication of such effort
would have no benefit for us.
In this letter I have
deliberately made no mention
of the extremist political stance
of the NUS, as this would not
directly affect IC students in the
way that the loss of money from
the C C U s and M a j o r
Subcommittees would. Don't
forget: it's our money they're
after!
Yours, in the money,

Liberal
Measures
Dear Pallab
Appearing in this newspaper
should be the results of a raffle
conducted several weeks ago
for the prize of some bottles of
wine and champagne. For those
of us who like drinking, and I
am one, this may seem a
welcome diversion, heralding
possibly the frequent
distribution of free booze by the
Union. My only slight criticism
is related to the presence of
several questions on the raffle
ticket.
To introduce a questionnaire
on NUS membership into the
present climate of ignorance or
bias, especially one clearly
written by someone against
reaffiliation is pointless. Given
the incentive of a chance of
winning some booze, the reply
for those who don't know the
issues involved is likely to be in
the direction indicated by the
questions. As I said, a pointless
questionnaire if a reasoned reply
is expected, and a dishonest one if
any weight is to be attached to the
results. S W Neild
