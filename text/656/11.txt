Thanks to the people who came out on Mon-
opoly. All 42 of you. The Life Sci Party went
off stormingly as did the dinners.
Events to come are the joint Ents/Rag trip
to Guildford (to sell Rag Mags) and Lewes (to
see the Carnival) tomorrow. Leave 1:00pm
from Beit Arch. For those among you who
haven't seen a plastic bodied Fiesta on the
yet, you'll see it on Sunday (see Gareth Fish
Chem 3) today!
One last plug for Rag Week: We still need
people for the street collection, festival, 106
+
1 darts, smoking concert, raft race, tug of
war, boat racing and possibly crap flinging.
See any officer any time any where.
Dave
Stoic
And a very good day to you all, from the
column that refreshes the parts BBC 1 refuse
to name on air. At STOIC we've been bend-
ing over backwards (for Colin?-Ed) to bring
you the latest in entertainment; just what this
is we don't yet know because of the impos-
sibly early FELIX copy deadline. What will
we broadcast next week? Who uses the hair-
piece? And just who is the mysterious Tim
Davey? All this and more on STOIC next
week. It's better than a poke in the eye with a
sharp stick.
Hope everyone who went to the New Year
Dinner last Friday enjoyed themselves and
the party we crashed afterwards.
As for Steve Flood and Dave Harrington
they obviously received their just deserts at
the U G M yesterday—so be warned all you
future offenders.
On Sunday is the famous Brighton Run, so
we want as many people to turn up in
their nightgear on Sunday morning at 8:15am
in Hyde Park to give Bo his traditional send
off with a 'pyjama boomalaka'. Then at 9:00
we leave Beit Arch by coach for Brighton
where we will be having a three-course lunch
and commandeering the 'bumper cars' for the
afternoon.
Don't miss the Guy Fawkes Party tonight.
Pierson, sprawled on the edge of the
sand dune, watched the tank
evaporate. The wind stirred the
marram grass and his sun bleached
hair. Overhead a bird metamorpho-
sised into a book and tumbled to the
sand. Pierson edged over, picked it
up and it bit him, its small white teeth
slicing into his sun-burnt flesh. He
watched the blood trace patterns
across his palm and slowly formed
the words Altered States, Tuesday 8
November, Mech Eng 220, 6:30pm.
We have had a busy start to this academic
year with many projects currently underway.
We are working on a paper on 'Women in
Science and Engineering' for a conference to
be held in 1984—Women in Science and
Engineering Year. We are also hoping to
collaborate with the College Health Centre in
providing some kind of information service
for women in College concerned about the
recent contraceptive pill warnings. So far this
term we have had a speaker from the London
Rape Crisis Centre and future speakers in-
clude Christine Sutton of the New Scientist
and Sarah Maitland (author of a recent book
on Feminism and Christianity). If you
haven't yet been to any WIST meetings we
would welcome you at future events.
With regards to other College activities we
feel that two events namely the Honorary
Pornographer's Night and the Mines Revue,
at which pornographicfilmsand strippers are
shown are an insult to the dignity of all IC
students. We are amazed that such events are
still allowed to take place on College premises
since not only do they contain material which
is degrading to women in general but particu-
larly to those at Imperial. It is sad when a
college which claims to look forward to an
increase in its number of women students
puts this possibility still further into the fu-
ture by permitting these events and thereby
condoning them.
We therefore urge all students at Imperial
and especially all WIST members to go to the
U G M on 8 November and vote for the 'anti-
porn' motion.
