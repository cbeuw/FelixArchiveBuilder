In Ray Bradbury's Farenheit
451 we discover a vision of the
future in which all books are
burnt and ironically the dis-
senters become the books. They
memorise the words, their minds
becoming libraries and archives.
'Fahrenheit 451' is the temper-
ature at which bookpaper
catches fire and burns. Montag is
employed by a state that does
not allow any kind of record. The
only official communication and
news comes from cornflakes'
soap operas of mind-numbing
simplicity on wall to wa
television screens. Orwell's
'1984' newspeak philosophy that
if you control words you control
behaviour, we can only
consciously do what we are
capable of thinking of doing, is
portrayed excitingly and with
some of the brilliance of Orwell.
Montag is a fireman using
kerosene in place of water to
burn secret libraries. He enjoys
his work until a series of events
and mere inquisitiveness set him
against his job, his wife and his
society.
As this is the first book review of the year I would not
only like to introduce you to a number of books but also,
along the way, welcome you in my own fashion to the
world of print. This article is not simply my review, it has
behind it the opinions of volunteers like Carl Burgess
and Guy R^ddihough who have read the books and writ-
ten short paragraphs on them. If you feel like a good or
even a bad read just leave your name and department at
the FELIX Office and we will give you a book. A book, if it
is a good one, is a part of the human mind with its
memories, emotions and thoughts. I hope this article will
encourage you to read and enjoy some of the books I
mention. Michael Newman
Both George Orwell and Ray
Bradbury have written their
celebrations of the importance of
the written word and the
freedom of expression that we
allow it. They also give us a
warning, not just against official
censorship but more importantly
against self-imposed censorship.
Our general apathy towards
reading, our prejudice fuelling
ignorance of those we disagree
with, enclosing our minds in their
own regimes of '1984'.
The publishing world is a very
harsh and profit-geared industry,
though probably no more so than
any other. If a book does not fulfil
the publishers requirements for
being marketable then back goes
the manuscript with a rejection
slip. 'Watership Down' was
rejected no less than six times
before a publisher was found
willing to take it. John Mortimer,
creator of 'Rumple of the Bailey',
has criticised this overpowering
yet unrecognised censorship. He
believes freedom of expression in
print should be the right not just
of 'good' authors, or the famous,
or formula writers but of
everyone. Afterall, there is a
book in all of us.

John Mortimer's books need
no recommendation. Penguin
have recently brought out A
First Rumpole Omnibus
including the titles: Rumple of the
Bailey, the Trials of Rumpole and
Rumple Returns. They have also „
published Rumpole and the
Golden Thread which was
televised in September.
Philosophers are the world's
thinkers, defenders of our
freedoms by the cut and thrust of
their words. The Worldly
Philosophers are the economic
thinkers, men as great and
diverse as Adam Smith,
Thorstein Veblen, Thomas
Malthus, Karl Marx and John
Maynard Keynes.
Robert Heilbroner wrote his
book as a graduate in 1953 and it
is a great tribute to him that the
fifth revised edition was brought
out by Pelican last August. It is a
remarkable book full of life and
clarity, somewhat unusual for a
work on the history of economics
and its researchers. It relives the
story from the time when there
was no economics to a
controversial and challenging
conclusion on today's world of
the multi-national companies. If
you are interested in history,
economics or politics it should be
compulsory reading.
Another brand of thinker,
closer to the hearts of you at this
college, are the physicists. Up to
the First World War and even
during some of it, there was an
international community of
physicists, speaking freely across
ignored boundaries of nations. In
Gottingen, Germany, students
and researchers alike would
discuss their theoretical worlds
and use the table tops of the
cafes to expand and solve their
abstract equations. The table
tops were never washed during
that time. This all changed with
the First and Second World
Wars. Patriotism, secrets,
military and government control
of science, nuclear weapons.
Night Thoughts of a
Classical Physicist delves into
the mind of an old professor of
physics living in Germany in
September 1918. He is dying and
with him Germany and classical
physics. A moving novel of the
changes and destructiveness of
history as seen by a single man
and his night thoughts.
Robert Jungk's personal
history of the atomic scientists
Brighter Than A Thousand
Suns tries to examine the minds
and lives of the important
physicists from 1918 to 1955. It is
an historical record, though
many might disagree with some
of its facts and interpretations.
As a story of the people behind
the nuclear bomb, trying to solve
mathematical and engineering
problems that would before the
end of the war destroy two
Japenese cities, it is a book I
found difficult to put down. The
questions it asks, the problems of
science and morality and
humanity it poses, are all very
relevant today.
A group of physicists at this
college, a part of the continuing
drama and dilemma that now
face not only them but all of us,
have had a new book published.
Barry Rubin, Philip Weber and
Graeme Wilkinson are co-
authors of the Penguin special
Crisis Over Cruise. The latest
missile to join our arsenal will be
arriving within the next two
months. This is an appropriate
book for all of us, multilateralist,
u n i l a t e r a l i s t and more
importantly the undecided. It
gives the information and
implications of the arrival of the
weapons in a short and precise
way.
Those of you who have seen
the movie War Games will not
want to buy the book, those of
you who have not should go and
see the film.
