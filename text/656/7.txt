STUDENT GRANTS
THE AWFUL TRUTH
This year student grants were increased by just 4
% bringing
yet another fall in student living standards. If you're won-
dering how you are going to make this term's money stretch
out until Christmas then you may be interested in the
figures below which give you a breakdown of where the
government believes your money should be going. I have
included last years figures as a comparison.

The undergraduate grant breaks down to £59.29 per week in term time
and £24.55 per week in the short vacations when no element for board
and lodging is included.
The postgraduate grant divides into 52 equal weekly parts of £57.60
each.

1. Entitlement to a mandatory
award
With a few exceptions, anyone
who has been "ordinarily resi-
dent" in the UK for at least three
years before they start' their
degree course should be entitled
to a mandatory aware (ie the
local authority has to pay them).
A person is considered "ordinar-
ily resident" if they are living in
the UK voluntarily for a settled
purpose. Many of you may be
aware of the legal battles of the
last few years over the meaning of
"ordinarily resident" in the con-
text of overseas students. Al-
though there are several retro-
spective awards still being fought
over, the position of new students
has been clarified by the addition
of a paragraph in the regulations
which clearly states that periods
spent in the UK wholly or mainly
for the purpose of full-time
education does not count to-
wards "ordinary residence".
2. Independent Students
Unless you are classified as an
independent student your grant
will be assessed on your parents
FELIX WRWWWWRWMhWKWM
income. To be an independent
student you must be either 25
years old or have supported
yourself out of earnings for at
least three years before you start
your course (this can include up
to 12 months unemployment).
You can not, unfortunately,
declare yourself independent
simply because you do not wish
your grant to be assessed on your
parents income; on the other
hand neither can you force your
parents to pay their contribution
to your grant if they choose not
to. This unfair situation leaves
thousands of students, who in all
other aspects are considered by
the state to be independent
adults, highly dependent on their
parents throughout their degrees.
3. Minimum Grant
All students entitled to awards
have their fees paid by the
appropriate local education
authority and receive some con-
tribution towards their main-
tenance. The minimum grant is
the amount received by students
whose parents earn over £22,260
and is also the' amount you will
receive if your parents refuse to
sign your grant forms. For the
second year the minimum grant
remains at £410.
4. The Means Test
Undergraduate grants are means-
tested against parental, spouses
and students income leaving very
few students collecting full grants
from their education authorities.
Residual income equals gross
income for the financial year
preceeding the start of the
academic year in question less
certain deductions:
a) Dependents (other than spouse
or children) £915
b) Domestic assistance in certain
circumstances £730
c) Parent who holds a statutory
award £375
d) Life insurance and superannu-
ation up to a maximum of 15%
e) Interest for which tax relief is
given under Income Tax Acts
(mainly Mortgage and Home
Loans)
Where there are two or more
award holders a deduction of
£210 for each additional holder
will be made from the contri-
bution which will be apportioned
between the award holders.
No allowance against gross
income will be made for other
dependent children; instead for
each other child dependent on the
parent a deduction of £75 will be
made from the assessed contri-
bution.
Parental Contribution
The parental contribution begins
at £20 for a residual income of
£7,100 and continues at the rate
of £1 contribution per £7 residual
income up to £9,000, then at £1
up to £14,300 and at £1 in £13
from there on. The minimum
grant comes into effect at a
residual income of £22,260.
Spouses Contribution
This scale begins with a contri-
bution of £10 on a residual
income of £5,500 and continues
at a rate of £1 in £5 up to £9,000
and £1 in £10 from there on.
Students Own Income
Any student who has an income
of over £375 per annum during
term time (vacation earnings
don't count) will be expected to
contribute to their own grant.
Any additional income above
£375 is deducted £1 per £1 from
the grant. However there is a
special disregard of £540 for
scholarships and £795 for Na-
tional Engineering Scholars.
5. Travel
£50 is included in the grant for
travel. You are entitled to claim
anything above this that you have
to spend on daily travel in to
College and on three return
journeys per year to your parent-
tal home. However, some author-
ities impose restrictions on the
reimbursement of travel costs.
Student Services can advise you
of these.
The student grants system is
complex and confusing and this
can only be a brief introduction
to some of the elements it.
includes. Extra cash is available
for dependents, vacation study
and older students (amongst
others), so if you want to check
that you are getting all that you
are entitled to, call into Student
Services. We can also help with
the perennial problem of chasing
up reticent authorities over late
grant cheques.
