IC Balloon Goes Up Poofter Pressie

Sunday 23 October. Other attractions included a steam engine rally, a
steam organ and a Victorian fancy dress competition.
No Gigs, No Parties
Ever!
IC Ents committee have had to
turn down concerts by two big
name rock groups The Alarm
and The B52s next term because
of a $even week block booking of
the Union Concert Hall by IC
Operatic Society. All future
concerts and parties in the Union
Building are also in jeopardy
because of court injunctions
threatened by Albert Hall mews
residents.
The Ents committee had ar-
ranged to have well known rock
groups at College every week but
may now have to cancel a large
number of gigs because' no
alternative venues are available.
The Great Hall was used in the
early 70s by such artists as Jimmy
Hendrix and Pink Floyd. How-
ever stiff regulations were intro-
duced by the G L C after the
spinklers in the Great Hall were
set off during a concert. These
regulations included the
provision of crash barriers, a cen-
tral control room and a back-up
generator in 1977. The College
estimate for these alterations was
£ 18,550 which was considered ex-
cessive at the time.
But in the light of the objec-
tions by local residents, Christine
Teller, IC Union Deputy Presi-
dent, is now investigating the
possibility of using the Great
Hall for concerts again.
IC Pass Go and Collect
£ 2 0 0 !
Last Saturday the Monopoly Rag
stunt was held on a bigger board
than most, the City of London
itself. Each street and station
represented on a Monpoloy
Board was visited by each team.
Dave Parry the Royal College of
Science Vice President and James
Benbow organised the event so ,
well and made it so exciting that
the collection of money for the
Boys' Club was almost forgotten.
Each team was given a set of
cryptic clues which led them to
places in every street and station.
To add to their problems eight
marshalls, dressed in disguising
attire, travelled around London
pouncing on the teams with
Community Chest and Chance
cards, including a 'Go to Start'
card which involved a trip to the
Tower of London.
The winning team with the
unlikely name of Joan Collins
collected £61. Guilds with 50
people collected £176. RCS with
50 peoplle collecte £102. The
mammoth game took the teams
8'/2 hours to complete, and with
no bankruptcies. Another
Monopoly Rag stunt is being
planned for Rag Week.
In a desperate FELIX publicity
bid Guilds President Mike 'Boy
George' Stuart has admitted to
transvestitism.
"I'm a self-confessed owner of
a pink dress, and a damned fool,"
said mincing Mike. "I wear the
dress at parties—it goes down
well with the boys in Guilds."
It is widely thought that this
blatant publicity stunt is a last-
ditch effort to salvage what
remains of his sabbatical credi-
bility.
Growing criticism of Mike
Stuart's presidential ability has
been apparent in Guilds in recent
weeks. The recent freshers din-
niers fiasco led Michael seriously
to reconsider his position.
Mark Coulthread Guilds DP
commented "I went rigid when I
heard the news about Mike. It
was like a bolt from the blue."
Smith
Snubbed?
Mr John Smith, College number
2, has been moved out of his large
comfortable office and into a
small cramped former meeting
room in the new College block
rationalisation scheme. He has
also lost his secretary and has to
share a typing pool with a
number of other College officials.
His secretary is .now working for
Dr Gary Hunt the famous TV
scientist in the physics
department. It is understood that
Mr Smith is quite upset by the
move.
IC Union President, Gaynor
Lewis said she did not know quite
why Mr Smith had been moved
but that she was sure that it was
not a snub by the Rector.
(Perhaps they should have moved
him to Southside?-Ed.)
long
weight
over
The weights room has finally
been moved to Southside after
md>nths of planning and
wrangling.
The move was originally
planned in January as the then
President Stephen Goulder was
notified.
Eight months later, the College
Estates section with their usual
efficiency had done nothing.
Estates had not even included the
weights room as part of the
Southside redevelopment
contract. President Gaynor
Lewis said she found the
situation extremely irritating.
The room still needs a little
preparation and the weights will
be arriving in a few weeks.
In the Family Way
Piggy in the middle Jane Howe pictured with Dave Parry an
Eric Derbyshire.
Ms Jane Howe was ratified
unopposed as the Royal College
of Science Union Honorary
Secretary at last Tuesday's
UGM. She replaces Ms Sue
Humphreys, who resigned earlier
this term.
Miss Howe is engaged to last
year's Hon Sec Mr Charles
(Chas) Fuller. She hopes to
marry Mr Fuller in the near
future and settle down to a life of
domestic bliss discussing the finer
points of retail management and
VAT returns (ie the only two
topics Mr Fuller has for social
conversation) over breakfast.
