Many members of the Union have exp-
-ressed disapproval of the system by
which the President of the Union i s elec-
-ted, that i s by the joint meeting of new
,and r e t i r i n g Councils at the end of the
session, and instead would prefer to see
him elected from the f l o o r at a Union Gen-
- e r a l Meeting. At the forthcoming Union
meeting Mr. Richard Lewis i s to propose
a motion i n favour of this l a t t e r course
and w i l l probably meet with some b i t t e r
opposition. In order to give the ord-
-inary members of the Union food f o r
thought before this meeting we publish
the two a r t i c l e s below, one by a sup-
-orter and one by an opposer.

The majority of students at college
are idealistic,socialist in their be-
haviour. This i s a good feature because
i t induces a very questioning attitude
to the society in which the student lives.
However,sometimes students are swept down-
river in their boats of democraoyjby the|
time they have manned the oars of practic-
ality, their l i t t l e craft i s lost on the ». v
sea. at. disorganisation. This?
is the danger of- the idea of the President
of the Union being eleoted by a poll of
Union members and not by Council.
The proposers of this motion have
the best of motives;the furtherance of
Democracy. However,let us consider the
praoticalities.What does the President
have to do?He represents the Union at
outside functions;he is chairman of Coun-
c i l and must be able to work amicably
with them;he is the major contact between,
staff and students and must be acceptable
to both bodies;last,but by no means least
ha i s intimately oonoerned with the admin-
istration of the Union and must therefore
be familiar with the processes involved.

'The ideal output of the Imperial
College remains a swam of mechanical,
eleotrical and chemical business smarties,
guaranteed to have no capacity for
social leadership constructive criticisms
or original thought' - H.G.Walls.
It as impossible to be * member at
this college without feeling some
sentimental attachment to i t , so that i t
hurts a little to realise that there i s
an element of truth in Wells' words. I f
you ask yourself how many great men have
come from this place since i t was
Thus obviously, the candidate oust
possess certain qualifications. It seems
fitting that Council,who have a know-
ledge of such matters should select the
President,who may,by the way,be nominated
by any member of the Union. The Council
i s elected by the Union.and i f they make
a poor choice, as* is, unlikely, they could
be instructed by the Union to ask the
President for his resignation.
The election of the President by a
poll of Union members is a system fraught
with dangers. Firstly,there i a the danger
of the President being a "popular hero"
but totally incapable of doing the job;in
this case,as happened at Battersea two
years ago,the outcome i s disastrous. The
Union folds up and the Governing body
step in,thus reducing the power of the
students to run their own Union. Sec-
ondly, the elected candidate may be un-
acceptable to Council i n the sens* that
their views may be radically opposed.
The administration will suffer since
continual argument w i l l slow down the
processes of decision and legislation.
Finally,in a college of 2,800 i t Is im-
possible for any one person to know more
than a small percentage of the members of

with Oxford and Cambridge in the same
period.
You may be tempted to enquire
the cause of this sad state of affairs
and I am inclined to think that the
answer to the inquiry lies in the a
absence of an eduoation i n certain
social graces at this college. Who
oan bar a great man i f he spurns every
ohallenge of dialectical exercise
or mental effort and has a mind
made up, not wishing to be confused
with facts? Who has not learned i n
his student days even the rudiments
of the democratic game?

the Union. In the election of the Iresid—
ent,where personal qualities are much
more important than policy,it is essential
that the voters know the candidates. The
only way this oan be achieved,short of
having whistle-stop tours of the depart-
ments, is by having the President elected
by Council.
Who would bother voting and who would
be eligible to vote?The apathy at college
is such that a large number of students
would not record their votes and hencs
the President could not be said to be
truly representative. As to who is going
to vote,the definition of which life
members of the Union are to vote,is
extremely difficult,if at a l l possible.
My personal test when people say that
this change would be a good thing,is to
look at the three constituent college
Presidents,who are eleoted by a democratic
process. Have the constituent college Pre-
sidents been better at their jobs than
the President of I.C?The answer,to'my
mind,is emphatically no.
Therefore,I see no point in changing
the prosent syatem,and I trustthat that
Union will not be swept off i t s feet*by
a watery wave of sham democracy at the
next Union meeting.
