i'tie sound of the drums drew us
from the house. V
.
'
e followed five
drummers leading a Union Jack and ab-
-out eight other assorted flags carried
by darkly dressed anonymous characters.
Down Westboume Park Road and into
Great Western Road they marcned at a _
slow steady pace while the drums beat
quietly but i n s i s t e n t l y luring the
occupants out of houses alon£ the way.
L i t t l e boys appeared i n ever increasing
numbers and f e l l i n behind, a shuffling
i l l - d i s c i p l i n e d parody of their elders.
They turned into Harrow Road shepherded
by an outnumbering force of policemen
then right, into a gloomy street
flanked by low drab imitation Georgian
houses. By a sign warning us "Beware
children play here." was a loud-
speaker van covered by posters.
These, advising us. to "Win with liosley"
and "Eat the oycott", explained the
origins of the nameless band. Union
Movement was on -the move.
About forty people clustered round
waiting f o r the speaer. Beyond them
the police waited, constables directing
the t r a f f i c and v/atching while their
officers moved about issuing instruct-
-ions. The gathering swirled s l i g h t l y
and an outer ring of trench coated men
suddenly appeared spaced about one
every three yards. A man also wearing
a trench coat appeared on top of the
van looking over the crowd and away to
the end of the street. I t was Mosley,
i n h i s trench coat, looking shorter and
plumper than h i s poster picture.
He spoke into a microphone with a
voice swift and persuasive Ww
should not achieve anything by r i o t i n g .
Our experience of race r i o t s has shown
t h i 3 . I f we wanted to be r i d of the
blacks and send them back to Jamaica
"then why not j o i n Union Movement i n our
tens of thousands. Then as a powerful
p o l i t i c a l party we could achieve our
aims and provide money from the National
Exchequer to pay f o r comfortable pass-
-ages f o r negroes returned to Jamaica
and f o r the provision of well paid jobs
there. The better type would be glad
of this opportunity and the others
would be shipped out anyway. He re-
-mlnded h i s audience of Englands great
past and now the pitch of h i s voice
was r i s i n g . I t had lost i t s warmth and
beoome harsh England had been betrayed
but we could s t i l l regain what we had
l o s t . The trench coats cheered and
Mosley continued h i s harangue. We
were reminded of the hysteria of a
H i t l e r or a Mussolini heard on old
news recordings, but there were no
massed regiments to retort with t e r r i b l e
rythmic cries of adulation, and Hosley's
words disappeared down the miserable
street to be l o s t unrecorded among the
t r a f f i c rumbling along the main road.
"Only j o i n i n and march behind the
magnificent band", he implored. "Pay
a small subscription" and a l l would be
attained. Come to h i s headquarters.
March back with him that night. Only
do something f o r England1
s sake. Again
the f a i t h f u l applauded and the meeting
was over.
About s i x of the trench ooats
gathered nearby. The drum band was
reforming. On i t s right flank stood
too blond youths, t a l l , slender and
proud. My companion remarked "What
perfect physical specimens of H i t l e r
youth." Immediately a short f a t
trench coat'.tumed on him , "What
do you mean poor physical speci-
men? That poor physical specimen
could knock you out i n no time."
Obscenity dribbled from the corner
of h i s mouth and he invited us
to name a time and a place when
the poor specimen would make
mincemeat out of us . Cowardly
by nature and overawed by their
superior numbers we did not reply
andoswearing and laughing quietly
they faded.jinto the gloom further
up the street .
The "magnificent band" led the
trench coats.and a few women ,
freshly recruited perhaps, on the
march home . Now proud of their
increased number they disposed
of the small boys who were chased
onto the pavement. There the
police were restraining a rather
violent young c y c l i s t , "but I
hate Moslay' , I have a right
to hate"Mosley , haven't I . " he
shouted.
"Not here," was the reply
and he was led o f f by a sergeant
while a constable brought h i s
bioycle along behind .

At the Old Vic the most
controversial new production this
season has been Visconti's "Romeo
and J u l i e t " • The I t a l i a n producer
has succeeded where many of h i s
predecessors f a i l e d , i n bringing to
the London stage a r e a l Veronese
atmosphere.^ The decor and aotors
both contribute to this i l l u s i o n ;
the sets, the street scene i n
particular, have a r e a l l y authentic
ring, while the young men of Verona
strut around and f i g h t with hot-
headed enthusiasm, just as one
imagines they d i d i n the f a r o f f days
of the "Romantics"
However; while h^s eyes were
beguiled, your correspondent f e l t that
the rather elaborate production
somehow tended to submerge Shakespeare's
words and hence the production lost a
good deal of i t s impact. The play
as a whole became unconvincing and
one never r e a l l y believed J u l i e t was
i n love with Romeo; one only saw her
going through the motions. But don't
take my word f o r i t - go and see this
much discussed production f o r yourself.
Tommy Steele fans have a chance
of seeing their i d o l when Goldsmithfe
"She Stoops to Conquer" i s produced at
the Old V i c on November 8 th. Mr. Steele
plays the part of Tony Lumpkin, while
leggy lount, of ''Sailer Beware" fame,
will.be. appearing as Irs.Hardoastle..
I n a less^»r4i»ssijniinj,-«ne. of the
best Musicals to coed on the London
scene during the long vac i s "Oliver".
This rather cheared up version of
"Oliver Twist" can now be seen at the
New Theatre. Of course the freshman
cannot go f a r wrong i n taking h i s
lady frionds to "My P a i r Lady" at the
Theatre Royal Drury lane, or "West
Side Story" at her Majesty's Theatre -
that i s of course i f h i s predecessor
hasn't already done so! I f you know
your g i r l friend r e a l l y * e l l a v i s i t
to "Pings Ain't Wot They Used' T'be" at
the Garrick Theatre i s sure to produce
some laughs (In the right places of
oourse)

Man, l i k e I'm mad, mean I'm up
the groove without a stylus. After
reading Rimshot's sleeve notes i n
the last squares' song sheet, I got
sent and played a r i f f i n the l o c a l
sax supermarket, l i k e I wanted a
Rimshot do-it-yourself hard bop out-
f i t , (man, the d o l l on that oash-
register, she was pounding the keys
l i k e Thelpnius Konk, but couldn't
blow nothing but A major. Pow, was
she oubic.'), I was r o l l i n g the l i f e -
size model of Uranus up Earl's Court
Road, when this cop rides up i n h i s
motorised vibes, l i k e he was play-
ing Land of Hope and Glory on the
siren.
This bum gets out his manuscript
book and says "I.an, that way you' 11
be doing your next solo on a steel-
bar harp with a cement soundbox."
This didn't figure to me, l i k e
nobody's played me any legal discs
about not r o l l i n g planets up Earls
Court Road. So I played t h i s guy two
or three bars about not reading the
road t r a f f i c aot, and he took off l i k e
he'd just heard Parnsworth practising
his extending trumpot. "Kan", he said,
"You're r o l l i n g that planet up a one-
way street, that i s , while the
Motor Show i s s t i l l playing." So he
slung me i n his jug-box, and made f o r
the c l i n k l i k e he was f i v e bars behind
the rest of cue combo.
Next morning, I made a one day
stand i n the witness box, and blew my
solo at the leader of the long-haired
guys on the benoh, making out l i k e I
played some blue notes at the cop by
mistake, but that magistrate' He was
square i n n-dimensions, l i k e he thought
Mantovani had the swingingest o u t f i t
ever. This hunk, he says "don't play
these chords i n here, my man", and
slings the book at me. He thinned out
my lettuoe some, the payola was .220,
for r i d i n g a planet without lights and
insurance, going the wrong way up a
one way street, and confusing the
J o d r e l l Bank telesoops.
So thats why I don't dig
Rimshot's outfit now. I traded i t
for a 1/I0d Jenitoys jazz set. Why,
man, their cardboard guitar i s
supplied complete with Bert Weedon,
and I traded him f o r an E.P. of
L i l o s Davis. ' S t i l l , I'm C20 i n the
double bass - thats what comes of
reading Himshot.
R . C . S . U N I O N
B.CS. held i t s f i r s t . Union-.
Meeting this term on Thursday, Nov. 3rd.
The meeting was primarily a buisness
one, but was enlivened by a good
attendence, some impromptu speeches
from the floor'and occasional oloud-
bursts.
The highlight was the election of
the <jueen of Jezebel, and the house,
whioh had great d i f f i c u l t y i n ohoosing
between the three young ladies, eventually
gave the loudest applause to the dazzling
redhead, Judy Lewis, a f i r s t year chemist
from South Wales. Our r e t i r i n g Quean,
Beverly Bradford, handed over the orown
and Judy Was duly enthroned.
On the election of another Trophy
Officer Peter Young gave a description
of the duties of this post which should
be i n every Union Handbook. Peter
Redfirm suffered himself to be alectea
to the post.
Other elections were that of L a r t i n
amith (Chea I.G.) as Exploration Board
Rep.,and those of the f i r s t year
