The hockey f i r s t XI got of to a good
start with a convincing 8-2 win against
St. Barts. At half time the score was
2-0 i n favour of I.e., hut i n the second
half we r e a l l y got on top sooring s i x goals
in the last twenty minutes.
The case of polio i n the college meant
that matches f o r the following two weeks
had to be cancelled. After this rest the
teams were eager to start playing again,
but last Wednesday's and Saturday's matches
had to be oanoelled owing to the weather.
One of the matches cancelled because of
this was the f i r s t round of the U.L. Cup
against Kings, and i t i s hoped to play this
match off i n the near future.
On Saturday, 5th. of November the f i r s t ,
second and third elevens had matches against
Guy's Hospital, The f i r s t eleven match
was a hard fast game considering the muddy
conditions, and the hospital side won 5-2.
The second eleven played well and managed
to hold Guy's to a two-two draw. The t h i r d
eleven provided our only win of the day,
and played exceptionally well to record a
5-2 win.
F i n a l l y I should l i k e to remind every-
one to TICK. OFF early i n the week.

Its badminton i n the Concert H a l l
at l a s t ! The long awaited'launching
of our new aquisition, a portable
badminton court took place on the a f t -
ernoon of Wednesday 2pd. Nove. iber. The
court ( a l l «U74 17 s 3d. worth of i t )
was an undoubted sucess. A l l we need
now i s permission to use i t regularly
on die evening -per week. I t i s to be
hoped that officialdom does not allow
the court to become a very expensive
white elephant- gathering dust i n the
gym.
The teams creaked somewhat after
he polio interlude, and the seoond team
isd a close but eventually--aulaaaaflil
Jpen to the season against a rajbher" de-
pleted Chelsea team. In the f i r s t match
in whioh a l l ladies have representeS. the
lollege at bsdmington .the •.girls-lost "
narrowly 5-4 to a strong King's team.
This was an exollent start f o r a new
venture.
