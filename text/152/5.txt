Ovei' the la3t year i t has become no-
t i c e a b l e that the number of anonymous
a r t i c l e s and l e t t e r s published i n PELIX
has increased. Furthermore, the pro-
-portion .of personal attacks i n such oon-
-tributions has been comparable with the
proportion of personal attacks i n the
weekend speeches of Labour Party leaders.
Unless we wish a l l discussion of Union L
a f f a i r s to resolve i t s e l f i n t o personal
invective, then i t might be useful to im-
-pose a ban on the publication of a l l un-
-signed—or wrongly signed—contributions.
It i s small comfort f o r those attacked to
know that the writers have not the courage
of their convictions and are unprepared
to substantiate their allegations. The
very fact that the •"•tides ar« nubliahed.
— e s p e c i a l l y when sisned with seemingly
authentic names—can give the impression
that there i s some substance i n the a r t -
- i c l e s .
Several people have commented oh the
improvement to the Union Lounge now that
the carpets have been l a i d . ' However the
fact that old lags are seeing an improve-
-ment doesn't cut much ice with aesthet-
i c a l l y minded freshers or Saturday night
hoppers from outside. Although the d i f f -

In the column Comment one union
member presents his views and c r i t i c i s m s
on the various controversies which per-
-ennially a s s a i l us. Obviously h i s
column presents one view only. This
column i s inteait.ed to reply to these
o r i t i o i s j i s , and to offer opposing arg-
-uments, although the views of t h i s
writer are not necessarily opposed to
those of our commentator.
Sane people have been vociferously
oomplaining that the l a s t editor of
FELIX printed anonymous l e t t e r s cont-
-aining personal attacks. This i s not
true. In none of the l e t t e r s printed
was any individual mentioned or referred
to, and a l l the authors were known to
the editor. Unfortunately there are
i n the College certain groups ho w i l l
never accept that the other side has a
case. I f a l e t t e r bearing the name
of a protagonist of one side appears the
other side dismisses i t as propoganda.
Thus i n order to present a case whioh
w i l l be debated on i t a merits i t i s .
sometimes neoessary to adopt a pseudonym
The F e l i x Board stipulates that the
editor must know the true name of the
author, but, providing the case presenr
-ted i s a good one, there seems no nec-
-essity f o r appending the true name of
the author. Perhaps some people oan
not understand that there are Union
members who don't write f o r FELIX j u s t
to beoome w e l l known.
cosy are considerable, the same excuse
can hardly explain the cold and bare IOOK
of the smaller lounges i n the Union 3uild-
-ing. Apart from anything else, our
Union Building must be amongst the poorest
whe i.t comes to paintings. We have, i t
i s true, two l o y a l photographs i n the
Union Lounge and odd daubs elsewhere, bu1
nowhere i s there anything hanging which
one would care to look at twice. I t i3
d i f f i c u l t to see the reason f o r this, be-
-cause pictures, unlike other items of
expenditure, can even increase, i n value
with age and the purchase of pictures of
a r t i s t i c merit cannot therefore be said
to constitute a threat to the Union
assets.
I t seems a p i t y that i t has been
decided to hold only one Union meeting
this term. This breaks a t r a d i t i o n of
many years standing that two meetings are
held i n the autumn term, one f o r the
presentation of'Accounts and one f o r any
other important business. The next meet-
-ing on November 15th. w i l l be the f i r s t
at which the quorum of 400 becomes legal
and unfortunately, due to t h i s break i n
tradition, some societies had already ar-
-rariged meetings f o r this date before
this change was announced. In addition
the crowded agenda makes that either
there w i l l be a very short discussion on
important topics, or the meeting w i l l go
on a f t e r 2.30p.m. and be i n danger of be-
-coming inquorate. Next term I 3Ugge3t
the Union meetings be announced well i n
advance and i f the agenda appears l i k e l y
to be crowded, an extra meeting could be
arranged.

On the question of Union lounges
I f i n d myself i n agreenw-it with Mr. Cox.
The i n t r a i u c t l o n of carpets to the low-
-er lounge has raised the standard to
that of a f i r s t olass station waiting
room. Who knows but what we may not
aohieve the standard of a second class
h o t e l foyer i n two or three years time.
Of course a few good pictures would
help to make the lounges a t t r a c t i v e and
would prove a sound invesianent; i f Mr.
Cox would loan us. say £100,000 I am
sure Council would buy the odd Van Gogh,
and i n years to come would s e l l at a
vast profit.*
May I o f f e r my condolences to our
commentator as he bemoans the passing
of the age-old t r a d i t i o n of two Union
meetings i n the Michelmas term. How-
-ever, i t i s not really" possible to
j u s t i f y a Union meeting solely f o r pas-
-ing the accounts as there i s usually
very l i i t l e discussion on t h i s subject.
I t i s unfortunate that this Union meet-
-ing clashes with some society functions
but i t i s not possible t o decide the
dates of Union meetings before the beg-
-inning of term as these are arranged
i n oonjuntion with the General Studies
Board. As many societies arrange
t h e i r meeting during the previous term
t h i s clash seems inevitable. We are
a l l somewhat apprehensive as to whether
the meeting w i l l achieve the neoessary
400 quorum. However providing our
P u b l i c i t y O f f i c e r j u s t i f i e s his pos-
- i t i o n there should be l i t t l e d i f f i c u l t y
i n r a i s i n g 400 hefds from a 2,800 pop-
-ulation.

You cannot change the traditions
of an i n s t i t u t i o n by an over-night
revolution, but you oan do a l l i n
your power to improve i t l i t t l e by
l i t t l e . That i s why I regard with
favour the trebling i n the number
of the s o c i a l clubs i n the l a s t few
years) although each one has been
established i n the teeth of the
opposition of the stupidest form
of conservatism.....Softly, s o f t l y ,
catches monkey,....One day t h i s
college w i l l be important because
we w i l l have learned how to have a
s o c i a l conscience.
I think i t i s important that the
Union should do a l l i n ipi power to
educate i t s e l f . This i s why I f e e l
that members of the Union should
learn to choose t h e i r own President
and oease to allow the choice to be
made f o r them. Some people say that
the members of the Union are too
irrespnsible to elect their own
President. This i s not true of the
vast majority of college unions
and I do not believe i t to be true
of t h i s Union.lf i t were true then
surely itfis the making of decisions
that causes people to be responsible
and the vicious c i r c l e of
i r r e s p o n s i b i l i t y must be broken
sooner or l a t e r . Some people sayi
look at the King's fracas or the
Battersea fracas, by way of evidence
against a popularly elected President.
B u i there have been some f a i r l y good
Imperial fracases i n the past two
years and we do not elect our
President. I think the truth of the
matter i s that probably the same
man would be elected either by the
Union or by the Counoil.
Now some people w i l l pick on
the l a s t statement tp prove that
there i s no. reason to make the
change, and they w i l l have completely
missed the point. The effect the
ohange w i l l have w i l l be to causa
a f a r larger number of people to
think.and argue about the q u a l i t i e s
needed i n a good President. To the
extent that to improve the output
of Imperial College i t s members should
learn toargue and discuss, an election
for President would be a good thing.
