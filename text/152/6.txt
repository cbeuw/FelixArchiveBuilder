For the first time ever the I.C.
Commemoration Ball was held at
Quaglino'a. The choice promised to be
a popular one, for a l l the tickets were
sold well in advance of the event.
Looking back the change of venue proved
to be a moat successful one,
The evening opened at 9.00pm,,
when the early arrivals were announced
by the Toastmaster,,and welcomed by the
President.
The number of couples dancing
throughout the evening paid tribute to
the excellent music: of the T
o
m
m
y
Kinsman's Orchestra, and the quality of
the ballroom.
This year a light dinner was served
in four sittings, ThTheuauperbe-manu
provided a choice of dishes for each
course, after which, coffee was served in
the foyer.
A photographer was in attendance
to record the notable events of the
evening, including the Links Club
meeting, which took place i n the Long
Bar at 11.00pm.
HELIX
SIR WILLIAM FUCK AND VTPCOUNT FALMOUTH.
Th* decor and general facilities
were of an extremely high standard.
Perhaps the only fault i n an otherwise
memorable evening was the occasional
xo-efficSency of the service.
Unfortunately the evening closed at
3.00am, when a reluctant, but contented
company dispersed.
In a l l the event proved to be so
highly successful that similar
arrangements are being considered for
next year. The success of the Ball
must be credited to last year's
sommittee f o r their organisation of this
memorable occasion.

The main point of interest
at this year's C

m
m
e
m
. Day, was
the address by the special visitor
Professor S i r CyriliHinohlewood,
President of the Royal Society >
President of the UassicallAss.
and something of a linguist .
His. speech wits concerned with what
he oalled'the two cultures 1
of
arts (or the humanities) and sci-
ence.
I think this was one of the
best addresses loiasn remember ,
and i t s relevance cannot be quest-
I ioned. That there is a split in the
oountry's intellectuals is obviour
and r,e should do nothing to widen
I this spit , even i f , as i s by no
means certain , we can do nothing
to close i t .
Sir Cyril certainly made one
or two very perceptive observations
whioh provided food for thought â€¢

Since 1884 successive generations of
engineering students have bean entering
the red brick, building designed by
Waterhouse on Exhibition road, and
which became the City and Guilds College.
On the evening Of Friday 4th November
a reception held at Imperial College -
the same boll whioh'was used to call
students to lectures i n 1884 was rung
again to mark the transition from the
old building to the new - now fully
commissinred as the first part of the
larger building for Mechanical
Engineering.
Under the guidance of men like
Unwin and his successors, the growth
of engineering education has been p
phenomenal during the last 75 years.
There were some ,,200 engineering students
when the City and Guilds College was
federated to form part of the Imperial
College in 1907. By 1952 there were
nearly 8001 today there more than
1,250 and the planned number i s 1 , 7 5 0 .
The major increase during the past eight
years i s the result of the Government1
s
decision to expand the Imperial College;
and the number of engineering students
both undergraduate and postgraduate,
oould only be increased by the provision
or more space and up-to-date facilities.
The new building, of which the
f i r s t instalment has now gone into
service, will be completed some three to
four_years henoe. It will take the place
of the bid buildings on Exhibition
Road,which will be progressively demolished
to make room for i t . It will be 440
feet long, and on nine floor levels,
and will provide teaching and research
facilities for more than 330 students
of Mechanical Engineering and for some
300 of the engineering students from
the other Departments of the College.
&k well as major groups working on
A-pplied-Theraodynamics ( all'subjects
concerned with oombustion and with heat
and mass transfer) and Applied Mechanics
( metal fatigue, plasticity, stress
analysis and the like ), the Department
also inoludes sections studying nuclear
power and production engineering.
The new building will form the eastern
boundary of a new East Quadrangle,
bounded on the south and west by other
new-trai-ldlMgg now-nnder construction for
C i v i l and for Electrical Engineering.
Designed by Messrs. Normen and Dawbarn,
the building i s of composite construction
with structural steel and reinforced
concrete frames. External treatment i s
similar to that adopted for the new
building-for the Physics Department
( opened last month by Sir John Cockcroft)
- white mosaic columns and spandrel walls
faced with green Swedish tiles.
