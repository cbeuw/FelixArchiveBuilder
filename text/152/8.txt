On Jaturciiy 2,th October the 1st,
2nd, and third elevens travelled to
Southampton for friendly matches
against the University. The 1st XI
played well, and showed a d i s t i n c t ,
improvement on their performance i n
the f i r s t match. The result of the
:xitoh was 2-1 to Southampton, but a
draw would have been a f a i r e r r e f l e c t -
ion of the play. I t was pleasing to
see fresher Dave Loftus, at r i g h t -
baolc a i d Lave Hunt, at l e f t - h a l f ,
playing so strongly and w e l l .
The 2nd XI also l o s t , by 3-0/ to
a strong Southampton side. Southampton
wore held to a 1-0 lead i n the f i r s t
half, but after half-time, their greater
stamina t o l d and they ran out worthy
winners
Of the three' teams playing at
Southampton the 3rd XI put up the
best performance,, and with Rod
Vi'ilshaw scoring twice, I . C . won 5-3.
On Wednesday 2nd November, a l l
I . C . teams playing were engaged i n
league matches. The 1st. XI, not
taking advantage of a strong wind i n
the f i r s t half, lost 1-3 to Kings I,
This was a great disappointment after
our fine display of the previous
Saturday. The 2nd XI, playing away,
l o s t 0-3 to King's I I , while the 3rd
XI, playing at Harlin~ton, went down
by the same 3core to Q.M.C. I I . The
f i f t h XI, however, won convincingly
by 5-0 against Northern Poly.
November 3th saw the 1st XI r e s t -
i n g f o r their match against Mannheim
University to be played on the .follow-
ing day, and the 2nd XI took the
opportunity of showing 1st XI how to
win.'Playing i n an away league match at
Condon School of Economics, they
"soundly thrashed the opposition and
won by 6-2. The 3rd XX, not to be
outdone, also won, by 3-0 against
Northern Poly, t h e i r second clear win
i n succession. The fourth XI, playing
against Old Templonians at Harlington,
i n a friendly were well beaten by
5-0, and the seventh team also lost by

The f i r s t week of league matches was
quite a successful one , with each winning

victory against Goldsmiths I and w i l l
go on to play the winner of Chelsea and
Charing X. The second team were unlucky
to draw L . S . E . I. as opponents add were
beaten by a superior side 9-0.

On Sunday s i x t h November the I.C. Soccer
and Rugby Clubs played the Mannheim University
clubs at Harlington.
The Soccer Club, including the college's
University players, liad a f i n e 5-2 win.
' The game started o f f at a fast pace,
and the German side scored two early
goals. Mannheim kept t h i s deserved lead
u n t i l the i n t e r v a l , but i n the second half
I.C. gradually got on top. The tannheim
goal was under almost constant pre ;sui-e,
and i t was not surprising to see the German
goalkeeper beaten f i v e time3. Two of
these goals were scored with long shots
by I.C. defenders.
The Rufper Club, also including U.L.
players, had a closer game, but t h e i r
greater strength t o l d i n the end. The
f i n a l score was 16 pts. - 3 pts. i n favour
of I.C.
A f t e r the matches Mannheim were ent-
ertained'at dinner. The teams then r e t i r e d
to the bar, where a general sing-song and
the drinking of much beer oompleted an
enjoyable evening.
