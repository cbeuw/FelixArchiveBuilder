It was with ni::ed feelings that I
volunteered to ;,ooapt the e d i t o r i a l
chair from ,"±a OcuTtsr at the beginning
of term and even now, as I set about
editingrayf i r s t issue, a certain un-
-easinesr. remains. Being, by nature,
a somewhat r e t i r i n g person one of ny
f i r s t thou~hts w s "Am I r e a l l y suited
for the job?" Maybe not! But then
what does one gain from university l i f e
i f one i s not prepared to accept the
c h a l l e n g e — i t would have been f a r
easier to have shunned the responsib-
i l i t y but i n taking up t h i s post I
believe that I am making a valuable
contribution to my own education.
Lute a l l new editors I v i s u a l i s e
certain changes i n FELIX. I think,
and I am sure that most readers w i l l
agree with me, that :^uc:i can be done
to improve the appearance of the
paper. Compared with other college
newspapers i n the University, FELIX i s
a very shabby a f f a i r . In the method
of production which we use at present
nKst of our efforts go i n t o actual
printing :>nd f a r too l i t t l e i n t o the
editing and w r i t i n g which form the sub-
-stanoe of the paper. The only ad-
-vantage that t h i s method commands i s
that i t i s cheap so that we oan manage
without external revenue (e.g. grant
from the Union, fees f o r advertising
etc.) I f we are to r a d i c a l l y change
the appearance of FELIX then we must
adopt a printing process whioh i s , of
necessity, much more expensive.
Since we barely make a p r o f i t on cur
sales as we stand there i s a l l too
l i t t l e latitude f o r Improvement i f we
oontinv.c without f i n e n t i a l hell; Two
main sources e x i s t , revenue from oom-
-mercial advertising, snd direct grant
from the Union, both of which are be-
-ing explored at the moment.
The other main d i f f i c u l t y which
FELIX faces i s the lack of v a r i e t y o f
and depth of material which appears i n
i t s columns. This i s inevitable owing
to the small o i r o l e of people a c t i v e l y
involved. But I am sure that t h i s i s
not a true r e f l e c t i o n of the talent a t
Imperial College. Remember that t o
many people outside the College FELIX
i s the only organ o f communication and
as suoh should record p r a c t i o l l y every
a c t i v i t y and opinion within the Students
Union as w e l l as provide features o f
general interest. So i f you have h a l f
an hour to spare, a keen interest, and
a sense of responsibilty towards your
fellow students settle down now and
become a FELIX correspondent.

Dear S i r ,
We were most pleased to hear that
the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. F i s h -
-er, intends i n the near future t o v i s i t
Pope John at the Vatican.
We hope and pray that the v i s i t
w i l l lead t o better relations between
the Church of England and the Catholic
Church, nothing but p;ood can come from
the tseeting,

Dear S i r ,
In the l i g h t of larlimantary de-
velopments, i s i t not time that a centre
was set up f o r the benefit of people who
l i k e to take"sporting chances"? noting
that i n preparation for the Carnival,
i l l e g a l betting took place on the out-
come of a tortoise race, I feel sure, that
t h i s type of thing could have been better-
ed" by the use of a bookmaker,totalisator,
or even better,by the s e t t i n g up of a bet-
t i n g skopjthis is to start next year).
Bonoe, any funotions (such as tortoise
races) oould be handled by a society
which I propose to form.
I know of twenty w i l l i n g people who
w i l l j o i n me i n forming a Sporting
Chance Society (for want of a better name),
and with our pooled knowledge of race-
courses, etc., I am sure we oould bring
f i n a n c i a l gain to a l l Union functions.
Any person w i l l i n g to throw i n h i s l o t ,
please n o t i f y me through the Union rack,
D. Brown.

Dear S i r ,
I enclose the following l e t t s r
which may be of interest to any of your
readers who anticipate using Icwt.of
sugar t h i s coming college year. I t i s i n
reply to a l e t t e r of mine t o the f i r m
concerned, enquiring as to the advantages
of buying 1cwt.sacks of t h i s most impor-
tant commodity.
Yours F a i t h f u l l y ,
O.W.Davies,
wear o i r .
We are i n receipt of your l e t t e r
of the 25th.Ootober enquiring f o r d e t a i l s
of the d i f f e r e n t i a l between 1cwt.sacks
of our T.L.Granulated Sugar and the equi-
valent quantity of 2-lb.packets.
For your information,1-owt.sacks
of T.L.Granulated Sugar are available at
a d i f f e r e n t i a l of j / l j d . p e r cwt.under the
oost of an eqivalent quantity of 2 - l b . p
packets. A single sack taken from a ret-
a i l grocer who i s not i n the habit o f
s e l l i n g sugar in bulk,would however,be
subject to an additional delivery charge
of 2/— per cwt. approximately,whioh
would narrow the saving to l/lgd per owt.
In view of the fact that i t w i l l
take you one oollege y e a r ( t h i r t y weeks
of term time)to exhaust a supply of sug-
ar purchased i n t h i s way,we f e e l that
the saving w i l l be problematical.
One further point should be
borne, ist mind, the grocery trade f r e -
quently treats packet granulated aa a
"loss-leader"and sugar i s . available a t
out prices from many r e t a i l outlets.
It may w e l l be possible f o r you t o
purchase 2-lb.packets of granulated
sugar f o r as l i t t l e as l/2d.or l / 3 d .
i n your vioinity,and at t h i s price,they
would i n fact,be cheaper fo purchase than
the equivalent quantity i n a 1cwt.sack.
*bs d i f f i c u l t i e s of transportation,the
p o s s i b i l i t y of a stock of sugar s p o i l i n g
i £ retained on your premises f o r th_s
length of time must also be borne i n mind
and we personally cannot-advise t h i s meth-
od of purchase i n your instance.
We hope that the above-mentioned
facts w i l l enable you to compare the r e l -
a t i v e merits o f purchasing sugar either
i n packet as required or i n bulk.
Yours F a i t h f u l l y ,

The Vamp, i s pleased to report that
the blood continues to flow slowly but
steadily. I f the present rate of en-
-rolmont continues the National Blood
Bank should be richer by over one hun-
-dred pints on Monday 12th. December.
The Vamp, i s puzzled however by the
peculiar d i s t r i b u t i o n of donors between
the departments. While the c i v i l a:id
mechanioal engineers have blooc to bath
i n , the e l e c t r i c a l engineers are a l l but
dry. Blood-letting physicists outnum-
-ber lethargic chemists by f i v e to one
and apparently botanists have never
«een blood at a l l . Anyway to a l l of"
you the Vaisp. expresses his good wishes
