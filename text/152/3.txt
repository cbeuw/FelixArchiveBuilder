Having obtained equality i n the
M to 5 world of I.C., the f a i r sex i s
now launohing i t s campaign f o r equality
in i t s s o c i a l l i f e . The major anomaly
t men-only-in-the-bar has been success-
fully attacked.
After the f i n a l freshers' dinner
(mixed ), several s l i g h t l y inebriated
aquariums attempted to rush the main
entrance to the bar. Tradition pre-
vailed. This however was just a blind
for the daring young ladles who stressed
the ultimate aims of equality by entering
through the door by the mens' lavatory -
*¥e just want to touch i t l ? They s w i f t l y
found themselves outside.

Drinks were served i n the
h a l l , and one young f i n i s h i n g
school product downed a pint without
stopping. She then lost interest i n
the proceedings.. I don't know whioh
sex takes i t s liquor the better, but
the men of I.C. allowed them to walk'
over to the sacred a l t e r of happiness
and place their glasses on i t . Far
from being resisted i n this symbolic
gesture I saw one I.C. man hiding a
g i r l under his jacket
But f o r Howard, who knows what
would have been the result, lerhaps
men would have been forbidaen from
the bar and have to wait patiently
i n the lounge trying to avoid the
lecherous gaze of passing g i r l s . Or
maybe curtains would be put over
the cold, black bar windows and
worst of a l l aquarium bar maids on a
rota.
However, with true decorum they
were esoorted out but the f i r s t blow
has been struck and the question
again arises "Do the men of I.C.
r e a l l y want to exclude women from
the bar?"

In def erenoe to those whose views- do

persuaded to write t — - a r t i o l e . Let me
say, right a , t I do not consider

I w e go further, and state, quite
oategorically, t tr— are a had thing.
Therefore, t a r t i o l e w not h any

their ignoranoe by using dashes. ' Now

Recently German Youth has
started to ask searching questions
about the events of the war. There
has been awakened interest in the
