Sara Hamilton reviews London’s biggest vegan festival, commenting on how
cutting down on meat may be the answer to our environmental problems
S
omething we are
constantly told
when it comes to
food is to ‘eat the
rainbow’. Densely
packed nutrients
bind to colour pigments,
hence why colourful veggies
are thought of as bright
bundles of nourishment.
Most white or pale foods
are overlooked, with many
lacking fibre and nutrients.
However, a few of these pasty
provisions lack the attention
they deserve.
One in particular starts with
a ‘C’, and should be your
next study buddy due to its
impressive brain-boosting
properties. I’ll give you the
rest of the article to try and
guess it. Most of the foods
mentioned in this article
are an anti-cancer army,
containing the body’s master
antioxidant, glutathione.
In particular, they contain
phytochemicals that inhibit
mutation-causing enzymes,
reducing the chance of
cancer.
We kick off with alliums,
namely onions, garlic and
chives. Many people think
of them as flavour enhancers
rather than what they really
are – gleaming nutritional
kingdoms. Warding off old-
age and disease, these guys
make other vegetables look
downright lazy. They are
rich in sulphur, protecting
us against cardiovascular
disease, chronic inflammation
and microbial infection. Fun
tip: after chopping garlic,
wait for 10 minutes before
adding it to whatever you’re
cooking. This makes it more
heat-resistant, and enhanc-
ing the flavour and effect of
nutrients.
Ah, the magic of mush-
rooms. With more than
2,000 varieties out there, the
most commonly consumed
include button mushrooms,
crimini and portabella. They
contain a compound called
Ergothioneine, that humans
can’t make but can be found
in fungi, kidney, red beans
and liver. It’s been found to
have profound anti-inflam-
matory and antioxidant
properties. A popular use for
shrooms, and one I strongly
support, is a total substitute
for meat. This reduces calo-
ries and salt whilst adding
fibre, nutrition and flavour.
If you really need meat, try
adding chopped mushrooms
to your mince.
The special C-word? If you
guessed cauliflower, you win
the prize of my gratification
for reading this whole article.
Not only does cauliflower
fight cancer, it enhances cog-
nitive function and memory,
lowers blood pressure and
improves kidney function. Not
sure what else you could ask
for in a vegetable. My last
tip: to preserve cauliflower
nutrients content, do not boil
them for more than 3 minutes.
Antioxidants are found in
the outer layer, making full
immersion in boiling water a
blow to all its efforts.
Now go forth, steam your
cauliflowers, stuff it in your
sandwich, and head to the
library. Bask in the little ‘thank
-you’s your brain, heart, and
(abused) liver murmur.

I can already feel
the eye-rolls. The
“Oh, this vegan
hippy nonsense
again” eye-roll, so
before I lose you
all, let me promise that I’m
not going to preach about
animals’ feelings or inform
you how tasty avocado is.
What I am going to tell you
about is a VegFest-induced
realization of how easy it
is to make a difference to
the environment and how
many people are doing so
already.
Roughly speaking, VegFest,
which takes place in London
Olympia every year, is one
of the biggest congrega-
tions of vegans you will see,
spanning over 250 stalls.
The result? 15,000 people
getting excited about hemp
burgers, coconut yogurt and
tables full of vegan cake.
What made me excited,
however, was not the fact
that some vegan scientist has
invented milk free Camem-
bert (exciting as that is), but
the realization that so many
people are making a stance
in trying to lead a more
sustainable lifestyle.
We’ve all been told from
a young age about waste,
recycling and taking public
transport but how does
being vegan, veggie or
eating less meat make a dif-
ference? Raising animals for
food, in fact, produces more
greenhouse gas emissions
than all cars, planes and
other transport combined,
and uses 30% of the Earth’s
land mass. In the US alone,
70% of all grown grain
is fed to farmed animals -
grain that could be used for
millions of starving people.
In terms of deforestation,
nearly 80% of land defor-
ested in the Amazon is used
as cattle pasture. Now isn’t
it a happy thought that just
by having almond milk with
your cereal or switching to
Quorn once a week you’ve
led to the production of 13
times less fossil fuel and 15
times less water usage than
you would have by having
an animal-derived product?
It’s been a good-news-
filled October for the
environment: more than
150 countries reaching a
deal to cut hydrofluorocar-
bons, Spain announcing
wind energy is sufficient
to meet 70% of it’s energy
needs and researchers at
the University of Wisconsin
inventing eco-friendly floor-
ing. Seeing the amazing
turnout at VegFest however,
proved that the environ-
ment is not something only
governments and eccentric
scientists are worrying
about, but thousands of
people worldwide too.
F
act: pineapples are
the only food to try
to eat you while you
eat them.
You read that
right: pineapples are
actually flesh eating monsters.
The zombie apocolypse is
upon us.
Pineapples contain an
enzyme, called Bromelain,
which is released when you
chow down on your favorite
tropical treat. It targets and
breaks down a range of pro-
teins in your mouth, and can
cause anything from strange
sensation to bleeding gums.
Given that Bromelain is also
used to tenderize meat, you
could call this the equivalent
of punching yourself in the
mouth repeatedly.
In fact, if you left a slice of
pineapple on your tongue for
a week it would completely
dissolve it (disclaimer: do not
try this at home). Luckily, most
of us can chew faster than
that, and once you swallow,
your stomach acid inactivates
the enzyme, rendering this
foul beast harmless. Even
better, the body will quite
happily replace the damaged
cells in your mouth, leaving
no lasting damage. Man 1,
Pineapple nil.
So there you have it. Pineap-
ples: Delicious, nutritious and
surprisingly aggressive.
