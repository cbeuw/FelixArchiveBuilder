MDMA
How you use it
Ecstasy comes in two main forms, a
solid pill or just as a crystalline powder.
The various weird nicknames for the
drug shown above (Rolex, Mitsubishi
etc.) come from little icons that are often
imprinted on the pills. The pills are, nat-
urally, swallowed but the powder can
be taken in a number of ways. These
include, but are probably not limited
to: snorting, smoking, and dabbing (not
that kind of dab) it onto your gums. You
can also wrap the powder in a cigarette
paper and then swallow that, essentially
making your own pill. Because of the
delayed impact of the high, users often
take a second dose presuming the first
hasn’t worked leading to a double
whammy when they both kick in. Mo’
MD, mo’ problems.
Legality
MDMA in any of its forms is straight-up illegal. In the UK it’s a classified drug
(Class A), meaning you can’t possess it, sell it, or even give it away. Simple
possession can result in a prison sentence of up to seven years, in addition to an
unlimited fine, and the police are pretty much obligated to give you some form of
formal caution regardless of how much you have on your person. This is the norm
worldwide, with Ecstasy falling under a UN agreement. Funily enough, a slip-up
in Ireland last year meant that for a day it was legal to possess and buy Ecstasy as
well as a whole host of other drugs before emergency legislation was passed.
Things to do when you’re high
Do
• Keep some chewing gum
handy (you grind your teeth
when rolling)
• Listen to music
• Channel that impulsive twitch
into creative and erratic
dancemoves
• Make new friends
• Express your feelings
and partake in bonding
experiences (not bondage
experiences)
Don’t
• Drink too much water (might
cause brain swelling)
• Do any tasks that require
sitting still
• Tell people you love them
(because you probably don’t)
• Eat like a horse (you’ll likely
throw up)
• Mix with a downer (a
depressant drug) or alcohol.
Although, this is controversial
advice.

What it does
First thing’s first, 3,4-Methylenediox-
ymethamphetamine (which is handily
abbreviated to MDMA) is the active
ingredient in ecstasy pills. Within half
an hour the buzz kicks in and can last
anywhere from three to six hours. This
energy buzz is what caused E’s rise
to prominence in conjunction with the
dance and rave culture of the 80s and
90s, allowing all night parties to live up
to their name. Bucketloads of serotonin
and dopamine are released, generally
making everything feel better.
Careful though, as this energy buzz can
subside rather quickly, resulting in anxi-
ety, paranoia and generally not a great
time. Word to the wise :what you take is
usually nowhere near pure and is likely
‘cut’ with some nasty stuff which could
have any number of side effects.
Some statistics
According to the crime survey of England and Wales, roughly 1 in 20
people consumed the drug in the past year, with it being the third most
taken drug behind cocaine and cannabis. MDMA-related deaths are
on the up in the UK with 50 people dying last year, linked to a rise in
stronger, more pure pills and powders.
