\\ The campaign, whilst
focusing on nipples, is
about so much more \\
Emily-Jane Cramphorn urges you not to
freak out about this week’s centrefold
Y
ou may have
noticed that
this week, the
centrefold is
a bit different.
There are
uncensored female nipples
in it, and one pair belongs to
me. Before you skip ahead (if
you haven’t already done so)
take a moment to read why
this centrefold should not be
viewed differently to nipple-
free centrefolds and why this
is so important. the survival of the human
race for aeons? Without the
female nipple we would not
be here today – historically,
females born without nipples
failed to nurse their offspring
and so were unable to pass
on their genes into the next
generation. But we live in a
society within which breasts
are hypersexualised and
their function is forgotten. We
use breasts to sell everything
from phones to diets, whilst
breastfeeding in public is
reproached. Why remind the
world of the existence of your
nipples when you could just
use a bottle, eh?
This sexualisation of breasts
detracts from their beauty,
as we are taught that breasts
should look a certain way or
they are bad. However, in
reality, breasts are not there
to be perky, they are there
to feed young and sustain
life. Notwithstanding this,
sexualisation is not always
harmful – embracing and
experiencing sexuality can
be both empowering and
liberating, but it’s important
that women’s bodies aren’t
sexualised without their
consent. We’ve created a
world where breasts are
sexualised to the point that
their simple exposure is seen as
sexual, as opposed to natural
and beautiful. Which is really
what breasts, bodies and this
centrefold are. Beautiful.
The Free the Nipple
campaign began four years
ago, when Lina Esco created
and featured in a film named
Free the Nipple. Its aim was to
raise awareness of everyday
sexism that exists within our
society by highlighting the
absurdity of censoring female
nipples not only within media
but generally within society.
In subsequent years the
campaign has gained both
support and momentum, with
participation from famous
figures including Miley Cyrus
and Cara Delevingne.
chose nipples over silicone
teats. It is about every person
having ownership of their own
body and celebrating humans
of all shapes, sizes, genders
and races. It’s about quashing
rape culture and the notion
that breasts are simply there
to look good or please others.
AnditisforthesereasonsIam
so passionate about freeing
the nipple – it represents true
equality for women in our
society. If women are able to
vote, lead nations and go to
space, why on earth must they
hide their nipples? Exposure
of the male nipple, which is
the vestigial twin of the female
nipple, has not caused the
world to burst into flames,
so why are we so afraid that
women’s nipples might?
Having said all that, after
leaving the shoot I started
having doubts. What is the
law surrounding this issue?
Can it impact my future or my
ability to do my job? Will it
cause me ridicule and shame?
Will people think my boobs
are bad or ugly or that I don’t
have the right body for public
exposure?
\\ We live in a

The campaign, whilst
focusing on nipples, is about
so much more. It is about
equality and respect for all
people irrespective of gender.
It is about mothers around the
world who are forced to feed
babies in toilet cubicles if they
When I was asked if I would
like to take part in a Free the
Nipple centrefold, my first
reaction was “Yes, it’ll be
amazing.” I’ve always been
taught to be comfortable
with nudity, and I’ve never
understood the stigma
associated with breasts and
the female nipple.
Sadly, my excitement isn’t
mirrored by society. We are
taught that the female nipple
is dirty, x-rated. That if we
slip a bit of nip we are being
provocative or disrespectful.
But what is so provocative
or disrespectful about
something that has ensured
me to do so? Western society
denounces Sharia Law for
censoring women’s bodies
then continues to do the same.
Fundamentally, censorship
of nipples is no different
to censorship of faces, but
somehow society fails to
realise this. Moreover, my
body is not an item to be
judged on its appearance.
It should not have to look a
certain way to be beautiful;
the sheer fact that it is a
vehicle for my being makes
it both beautiful and worthy
of respect. For this reason,
I resolved with myself that I
would not backtrack on my
commitment to this centrefold.
It is because of the stigma
surrounding women’s nipples
that I decided to bare all in the
first place. Deciding to back
out simply adds to the idea
that women’s bodies must look
a certain way and that breasts
and nipples are shameful and
need to be hidden. Unless of
course they are both perfectly
plump and perky, and on
the pages of Playboy for the
pleasure of men.
#FREETHENIPPLE
The fact that I was so
vulnerable to such thoughts
infuriates me because nipples
should not be criminalised,
they should not impact my
career and they should not
be a cause for shame. Yet
because I am a woman they
are. If I had a penis I wouldn’t
think twice about whipping
my top off for a centrefold, so
why should my vagina cause

Sebastian Gonzato offers the green
argument for nuclear power
A report by Zero Carbon
Britain in 2007 predicted that
while total wind resources
amount to 3,212, TWh/year,
only around 14% of this could
realistically be tapped. The
UK’s energy consumption
was 2,249 TWh in 2014, so
even with other renewables
sources, meeting this
demand is impossible without
converting vast swathes of the
countryside into wind farms.
I
’mcurrentlyinSwitzerland,
which is about to have its
twelfth referendum this
year (and you thought
Brexit was bad). Having
rejected a minimum
living wage, the Swiss will be
asked to vote on an initiative
proposed by the Greens
on whether to speed up the
closing of nuclear power
plants. Unlike with Brexit, the
Swiss government is unlikely
to follow through with this
proposal no matter the result
of the referendum, and I’m
tempted to agree with them.
This referendum is actually
asking when Switzerland
should shut down its nuclear
power plants as opposed
to whether or not it should.
However, it serves to highlight
a trend in Europe towards
phasing out nuclear power.
Switzerlanddecidedtophase
with nuclear power and also
by legitimate concerns on how
to dispose of nuclear waste. In
the case of Germany, Belgium
and Switzerland, the choice
to eliminate nuclear was also
due to pressure from green
parties.
This is all well and good
if it leads to more use in
renewables, and in the case of
Germany at least, it has. (Best
not mention Belgium’s track
record.)
Germany’s Energiewende,
or energy transition policy,
has led to a tripling in the
electricity provided by
renewables in the last ten
years to 31% of the total. Most
of this comes from wind and
solar photovoltaics (PV) rather
than dubious renewables such
as biomass, whose green
credentials are questionable.
It is hard to argue that this isn’t
a step in the right direction,
but that isn’t the whole story.
The problem is that coal
consumption in Germany has
stayed constant thanks to its
decision to phase out nuclear.
In fact, its emissions actually
increased some years and
have stayed roughly constant
since 2009.
A similar situation has
occurred in Sweden, where
a tax on nuclear power
has allowed for a laudable
increase in investments for
renewables. Sweden also aims
to have 100% carbon free
electricity production by 2040,
which is simply not possible
solely with renewables. A
paper that appeared in the
European Physical Journal
predicted that CO2 emissions
would actually double if
Sweden phased out its nuclear
reactors, principally because
the best way to deal with
intermittency issues would be
gas fired power plants.
In short, going carbon free
with only renewables is not
possible. This is due principally
to intermittency issues as
mentioned earlier, but also
because of the sheer amount
of energy we consume. At
last year’s Imperial Climate
Change Symposium, Asad
Rehman from Friends of the
Earth stated that there’s more
than enough wind and solar
energy to satisfy the UK’s
electricity demand, which is
quite simply not true.
out nuclear after Fukushima
while Germany, Sweden and
Belgium have been doing
so (or at least attempting to)
since Chernobyl, and Italy
became nuclear free in 1990.
In all these countries, the
decision to opt out was driven
by the fear factor associated
Then there are the problems
with intermittency.
Germany actually causes
blackouts in Poland and
the Czech Republic due
to the inconsistency of its
wind power. This is not an
insurmountable problem, but
given that storage solutions
are costly (and come with
their own significant carbon
footprint), it’s likely that the
solution will come in the form
of some form of fossil fuel.
Given all this, my own
opinion is that nuclear is a
necessary part of the energy

mix, at least until we are able
to reduce demand to the point
that we can meet it with only
renewables. On this point at
least I agree with the Green
Party, whose energy policy
aims to reduce electricity
demandbytwothirdsby2050.
Call that target ambitious or
naïve, but at least it recognises
that reducing demand is more
achievable than meeting it
with renewables.
To be clear, I’m not
particularly pro nuclear and
my opinion of Hinkley Point
is ambivalent at best from
reading the Private Eye so
much. I do, however, think it’s
important to be practical, and
stubborn anti-nuclear policies
and wishful thinking can be
as damaging to the green
movement as climate change
denial. This is a view shared
surprisingly by the inventor of
Gaia theory, James Lovelock,
who has come out as pro
fracking and nuclear in the
last decade. Unlike Lovelock,
I am not as pessimistic about
our future as a species, but we
need to be more pragmatic
and less ideological if that’s to
remain the case.
