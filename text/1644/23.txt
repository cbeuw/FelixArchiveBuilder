in general as they cannot
relate to how the females are
portrayed.
Focusing on the more
positive aspects though,
more female characters have
started to show up in more
proactive roles as time went
on. Lara Croft might have
been sexualised but she was
the main character of her
story in her own right. The
Super Smash Brothers series
went from only having one
playable female character to
O
nce upon
a time, Pac
Man was as
advanced as
games got,
with basic
graphics and simple controls.
We’ve definitely come a long
way since then with regards
to designs, gameplay and
much more. With the change
and progression of games,
we’ve also seen a change in
how female characters have
been represented, and for the
better.
Let’s face it, games never
did treat females the same
way they treated men,
especially in the past. Video
game development used to
be a predominately male
rescues the damsel in distress,
played out multiple times.
Look no further than Super
Mario just to get what I’m
talking about.
We then look a little further
in time to when graphics were
getting better and people
were growing up. Around the
90’s, gaming became a more
mature business, with a lot of
young gamers now entering
teens and early adulthood.
But as you might expect, the
female characters that were
introduced were heavily
sexualised with bodies way
out of proportion. The first
couple of Tomb Raider games
for instance, sure they had
a main female protagonist,
but one with large breasts
and always wearing tight,
revealing clothes. The number
of female characters and
protagonists was also a bit
lacking; some of them had
good qualities about them
but there was more much
emphasis on their bodies than
anything else.
Things weren’t great with
regards to representation
of women. Their very few
depictions and appearances
were heavily stereotypical.
They had hyper-sexualised
bodies and little to no charac-
ter development. They were
depicted as being helpless or
victimized, needing a strong
male character to rescue
them, and sometimes, fall
for. Representation like this
is harmful. It perpetuates a
misogynistic picture to males
and females, where males
see women as objects and
women, either think they’re
only supposed to look pretty,
or stay away from games
a significant number; Princess
Peach can now beat up
Bowser for all the times he’s
kidnapped her!
Moving on to more recent
times, trends have been
changing. While game
development may still be
male-dominated, it’s less so
than before and gaming itself
isn’t. Currently, there’s roughly
an equal number of females
who play games as there are
males. With the advent of
the internet, it’s also become
easier to raise your voices at
anything unfair and absurdly
ridiculous.
In general female charac-
ters are definitely portrayed
much better today, as com-
pared to previous times. Lara
Croft now has more practical
clothing as well as body
that is actually realistic. The
leading female characters in
the new Call of Duty games
are also all strong charac-
ters, equally as dominant
as their male counter parts
with proper padded and
armoured soldier uniforms.
Even sporting games are
showing this trend, with the
upcoming Don Bradman
Cricket 17 games confirmed
to have both female players
and teams, ensuring that the
women’s game is just as fair
and true as the men’s game.
There are also a fair number
of customisable options where
people can choose female
characters and attributes for
their avatars.
Are things fine then? Is
everything good? Come on,
The evolution of female characters in games
let’s be real here, there’s still
a long way to go. In spite of
the increase in the number of
female protagonists in games,
they are still in the minority
and not rpughly split 50/50.
In some games, sexualisation
is still present, where the
female ‘armour’ barely covers
half of a woman’s body. Also,
don’t forget the #GamerGate
scandal in 2014 which started
as an attack on a female
developer and escalated into
a shitstorm.
It’s nice that Games are
adjusting for the better. Things
aren’t perfect yet, but they’re
getting there, and that’s what
counts.

profession, with games cater-
ing to the male audience.
Looking at the very first few
games, we had the stereotypi-
cal story where the male hero
Female characters act as role models and inspiration for other girls; like cosplayers for instance \\ Leonardo Veras
