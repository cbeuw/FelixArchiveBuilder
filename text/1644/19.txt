The ‘nasty women’ of Broad City
I
t was during the last US
Presidential Debate that
Donald Trump muttered
‘what a nasty woman’
Hillary Clinton was, the
latest of Donald Trump’s
transgressions. Minutes after
the debate had finished,
Twitter was ablaze with
women reclaiming the insult.
Elizabeth Warren made
‘nasty women’ the centre
of her speech stumping
for Hillary Clinton, and
Samantha Bee, the only
female host on late night
comedy in America wore a

this week’s episode of Full
Frontal with Samantha Bee.
‘Nasty woman’ has struck
a nerve. Women now more
than ever are tired of the
idea that first and foremost
they must be likeable. They
are tired of the concept that
having opinions, being clever
or funny, or having the audac-
ity to stand up for your beliefs
must first make the concession
to whether we appear to be
agreeable. In television, par-
ticularly in comedy, women
who don’t conform are
dismissed as ‘shrill’ or worse,
and clips on YouTube are
flooded with comments along
the lines of ‘who knew a chick
could be funny?’ (When will
this myth die?!)
Thankfully, there are a few
shows (noticeably often those
which are female-led and
directed) that buck the trend,
portraying women neither in
the ‘likeable’ role, nor in a
‘strong independent woman’
role. The latter is a trope
that substitutes a propensity
for violence as a substitute
for building a nuanced
personality.
Broad City began as a
comedy webseries produced,
written by, and starring Abbi
Jacobson and Ilana Glazer.
Still available on Youtube,
the webseries followed the
characters, Abbi and Ilana,
through life in New York. One
episode featured Ilana enter-
ing into a relationship with a
man solely because he had a
washer/dryer in his apartment
(they have previously been
accustomed to taking clothes
in bulk to their parent’s home
in Pennsylvania), another was
in set in yoga class: ‘I already
feel so much taller, leaner,
and more organic’ mused
Abbi as she settled into an
upwards facing dog pose.
Championed by Amy Poehler,
the show transitioned into a
half hour show on Comedy
Central in 2014.
The TV series, with its
higher production values,
has nevertheless retained
its rough-around-the-edges,
improv feel. The episodes
meander through loosely
sketched plots, falling down
several rabbit holes along
the way. In one episode,
Abbi has dental surgery;
high on painkillers and weed,
she wreaks havoc in Whole
Foods, egged on by the hal-
lucination of a giant stuffed
toy named Bingo Bronson. In
another, Ilana and her mother
go to Chinatown in search of
knock-off designer hand-
bags and are led through a
manhole into an underground
bunker; in the same episode,
Ilana bursts into joyful twerk-
ing at her grandmother’s
Shiva when she hears Abbi
has pegged her boyfriend.
Broad City female leads
would be the first to reclaim
the title of ‘nasty women’;
though they might prefer
the urban dictionary defi-
nition: sexually liberated,
and incredibly cool. Abbi
and Ilana live pay-check
to paycheck in rat infested
apartments, have regular
‘weed dudes’, hustle for Lil
Wayne concert tickets, and
bring pillows into work so
they can fall asleep crammed
into a bathroom cubicle. They
have little or no ambition
beyond making the most of
Bed, Bath & Beyond coupons
that never expire. They aren’t
role models, they’re not
meant to be. These are the
‘id’ characters that men have
The new, ‘nastier’ faces of comedy\\ Comedy Central
inhabited for so many years
on television; Glazer and
Jacobson have launched a
sneak-attack of feminism to
create female characters that
take up the mantle.
It’s refreshing to have
characters so removed from
the roles women often play
in comedy: the nagging
girlfriend or wife or mother
(see: every female character
on The Big Bang Theory), the
hard-ass boss, or the straight
man to their male co-star who
gets up to all the antics. The
Broad City women for all their
wackiness feel real, dialled-
up-to-eleven, responsibility
and ambition free versions of
the smart, hilarious women
we all know.
Broad City above all is
so exuberantly joyful, it’s
addicting. It has perhaps
the best portrayal of female
friendship on television right
now (Brooklyn Nine Nine’s
Rosa and Amy have lately
been giving the two a run for
their money). In one particu-
larly iconic scene, Abbi and
Ilana, dressed in homage to
Missy Elliot and Nicki Minaj
respectively, burst into a bank
dancing to Drake’s ‘Started
from the Bottom’ to cash
Abbi’s check for ‘eight fucking
thousand dollars’. When the
clerk’s disgruntled ‘ma’am’
breaks their rap fuelled
reverie, Ilana confronts the
unimpressed bank clerk: ‘you
know how she got [the 8k]
dude? This bitch, right here,
drew this illustration and a
sexy new dating website
bought it’ When the bank
clerk still looks bored, she
adds ‘it came from her heart’.
It’s hard to describe the
vibe of Broad City without
underselling it. The premise of
two best friends living in New
York is hardly revolution-
ary stuff, and yet it’s quite
unlike anything else. It defies
explanation. It should be on
everyone’s to-watch-list; come
for the low-key feminism, stay
for the incredible fun.
