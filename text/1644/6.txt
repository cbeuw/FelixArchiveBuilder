What, then, became of this
huge sum of money?
Firstly, private donations
were mainly directed to
emergency response, all
imported from outside the
country. Hence, virtually no
money was allocated to local
government, companies, or
organizations.
Secondly, the US
government and organisations
such as USAID spread their
investments in a rather strange
manner. Over a $ 100 million
was allocated to housing
projects, including luxury
townhouses with swimming
pools for the staff.
As though to further mock
the suffering, $ 18 million was
spent on the construction of
an Olympic-style sports and
recreational centre adjacent
to one of the largest tent cities,
where clean running water
and plumbing was alien to
most. Even more,$ 260 million
funded the completion of
Caracol Industrial Park, which
is located over 150 miles
north of where the earthquake
struck.

f you were to hear mention
of Haiti in a conversation,
what would your initial
thoughts be? Some of you
would likely confuse it with
Tahiti or have no clue as
to what Haiti actually is. For
most of you, though, I am sure
the first thing to pop into your
mindswouldbethedevastating

that hit the impoverished
country in January 2010,
killing an estimated 300,000
and leaving over two million
without homes.
most of the livestock and,
in some areas, 90% of the
infrastructure was destroyed.
You may be surprised to learn
that this is simply due to the
fact that almost all the houses
are essentially tin-roof shacks.
Despite global awareness
of the earthquake and its
aftermath, I was shocked to
discover that most remain
completely oblivious to the
population’s current living
conditions. They assume the
vast influx of emergency aid,
which I would like to note was
so highly advertised in the
media, would have repaired
some, if not all, the damages.
Nonetheless, over 80% of the
rubble is unmoved and millions
continue living as refugees in
tent-cities outside the capital,
Port-au-Prince.
In fact, take a short drive
through and you would be
astonished at the seemingly
post-apocalyptic landscape
the city became, and still
remains, since that fateful
afternoon on the 12th
of
January 2010.
This begs the question: Why
are Haitians still living in such
dire conditions? Conditions
that should have been dealt
with years ago? One answer,
however paradoxical, may
lie with the humanitarian aid
community.
In Haiti’s case, external aid
originating from NGOs to
entire governments resulted
in a plethora of unintended
consequences. Few may be
aware of it, but is an issue
which arose long before 2010.
In the early 1980s, Haiti
was self-sufficient in rice
production. Though, due
to a growing population,
the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) proposed new
trade liberalisation policies
on rice imports, aimed at
affecting mainly peanut, and
sugar cane cultivation. Thus,
despite the well-intended
nature of this gesture to the
country, the long-lasting result
was further destabilisation of
an already fragile economy.
After the earthquake struck,
millions of individuals donated
to various charities providing
immediate emergency aid. A
whopping $10 billion were
raised from these efforts
and promised to the Haitian
government. Yet, less than 1%
reached its designated target.
preventing famine. Once
implemented, import tariffs
were subsidised from 35% to
a mere 3%. A wave of rice
imports from the United States
followed, commonly known
as ‘Miami Rice’. Competition
with domestic production
increased and by the late
1990s, imports outpaced
local production, and those
employed in the sector were
forced to abandon work and
move elsewhere. This created
a dependency on imported
rice, and this pattern rippled
across the agricultural sector,
As for me, Haiti is simply
home. I am often approached
about my origins, and I can
say from personal experience
that only after my mentioning
the natural disaster are people
able to place it on a map.
On the 4th
of October, Haiti
was once again ravaged by
mother nature, only this time,
the culprit was the category

southwest region received the
brunt of the blow. Crop fields
were swept away along with
Not only has the distribution
of foreign aid to Haiti after the
earthquake been conducted
in a most bizarre fashion,
whatever efforts actually did
reach the Haitian people
purely involved giving. This
did provide immediate and
effective results in the short
term. Nonetheless, after six
years of aid influx, it does not
come as a surprise that the
inhabitants’ living conditions
remain unchanged as they
grew dependent on foreign
donations.
To summarise, aid has
become a self sustaining
industry,promotingpermanent
charities, particularly in places
like Haiti, driving out local
businesses and preventing
governments from progressing
on their own terms. But
how can a government be
expected to progress when
external influences (e.g.
charities) reduce the pressures
of certain issues (e.g. poverty),
thereby distracting from a truly
effective solution? Though
there is no correct answer, a
stepping stone would involve
efforts aimed at increasing
pressures on local government
to instil self-sustained change,
through local job creation,
reconstruction of infrastructure
and, finally, on education.

i n d i v i d u a l .
Except, perhaps, to those in
the US whose lives may be
a little more impacted by his
political parties?
Lots of people, over lots
of conversations, have their
own answer for this. Bruce
Springsteen, for example,
this week said that he thinks
it’s to do with The Donald
pretending to ‘left-behind
people’ that he is listening
to them when others aren’t. I
think that is a short term and
inaccurate view. In order to
understand the phenomenon
that is Donald Trump, in my
opinion, we have to look
more deeply at the root of
the problem: The Republican
Party itself.
The Republican Party
traditionally stands on
the Conservative Right of
American politics, espousing
policies such as free markets,
deregulation and traditional
Christian values, against the
Democrats, who believe in
liberalist policies of mixed
economies, civil liberties, and
social justice. These divisions,
and the arguments on both
sides, are important ones,
and it is the political wrestling
of nations between a range
of approaches that results in
countries taking steps forward,
using a diverse collection of
ideas and methods.
This election, however, is
not about these issues. This
election is the inevitable
outcome of years of what I
would term ‘Republican Low-
Road-ism’. That is to say, the
Republicans abandoning
reason for madness, slinging
mud desperately at the
Democrats, and appealing to
the insecurities and unfounded
beliefs of the American people
in a shameless attempt at
scooping as many votes as
possible. This policy, and
the post-truth America it has
created, has paved the way
for a Donald-like character to
march into the Oval Office.
The Republicans have gone
with this for so long because,
thanks to underlying beliefs
and heavy propaganda,
Americans have been coaxed
into rejecting rationalist
observation, and give their
votes to people who defend
their right to stupidity. But even
the Washington Republicans
have their limits: they are
bound,atleasttosomedegree,
by political correctness, and to
play to American weaknesses
such as racism and fanatic
xenophobic patriotism is a
step too far.
But not for Trump. He is
happy to stick his silly face on
the news and announce that
Mexicans and Muslims should
all leave the US, that the US
should “screw” foreign people
like he screws them, that
Blacks have ruined Baltimore,
and that women are just things
for him and other men to play
with. This, clearly, resonates
with some Americans, and
has rocketed his non-existent
political career to where it is
now.
\\ This election

‘Republican Low-
Road-ism’ \\
The Republican Low-Road-
ism has seen some strange
policies adopted, such as the
publicdenialofclimatechange
and global warming, and the
frank and angry rejection of
evolutionary theory in favour
of creationism. With due
respect to all beliefs, it seems
odd that a modern, Western
country, that houses such
great intellectual institutions
as Harvard, MIT and Yale,
should have politicians
claiming that climate change is
a “hoax”, and, on the theory
of evolution, stating “I don’t
accept it”.

caricature lunacy.
He is, at heart, a TV
personality, guffawing and
grimacing his way onto
the news until he becomes
an ever-present part of the
political atmosphere. But if we
stop and think for a moment,
it is startling to conceive that
a man who is openly racist,
is caught bragging about
abusing women, and wants
to throw his running rival in
jail is in contention for the US
presidency. The fact that he
survived the release of the
genital-grabbing comments
is testament to the fact that
nobody expects any better of
him.
Yes, he’s not the first
American Right Wing loony,
and he probably won’t be the
last, but how can it be that such
an individual actually holds

It must be said that there
are most certainly other
reasons why Trump has done
so well: Clinton, although
vastly more experienced, is
easy to dislike, and her smug
dismissal of Trump and his
‘deplorables’ won her few
friends. Nonetheless, the
pre-disposition of millions of
Americans, particularly white
men, to support Trump is
indicative of the Republicans’
having deepened the furrows
of systemic racism, violent
xenophobia and denial of
basic science that have cut
through America’s potentially
bright future. Whilst Hillary
has her drawbacks, she is the
obvious candidate of choice
for all rational human beings
and, as such, I hope it is not
too presumptuous to proclaim:
we’re with her.
All he’s done is continue
the Republican Low-Road
approach, but take it
further than his rivals were
willing to. It is, essentially,
the Republicans’ own fault
that they are stuck with The
Donald. The fundamental
point is this: Trump is not a
one-off nutcase, but is the
bed that the Republicans have
been making for the past few
decades – and now they have
to lie in it.
