A
ten-year old
maize seller,
Phiona, asks
her older sister,
Night, as she
pokes her head
through the hole in the wall
of their rotting (rented) hut in
the Katwe slum of Kampala,
Uganda: “Do you think God
is angry at us?” She has
recently lost her father and
a sibling, and her younger
brothers desperately need
to be fed. Before turning
and running off to her new
boyfriend, the only man in the
area with enough money to
buy her a new dress, Night
pauses for a moment, and
then quite coldly replies “I
don’t think he cares”
Perhaps this isn’t the
kind of scene you’d expect
to be seeing in a Disney
movie. But then Queen of
Katwe isn’t your average
Disney material. It tells the
story of Phiona (Madina
Nalwanga) and her family:
her mother Nakku Harriet
(Lupita Nyong’o), Night
(Taryn Kyaze) and her tod-
dler brothers. Their lives,
like the lives of everyone
around them, are a dead-
end struggle; sell maize at
a higher price than what it
was bought for or the rent
cannot be paid and their
family cannot eat. There
is from time to time some
oversimplification of life
in Katwe – a wound goes
untreated to no conse-
quence, for example – but
this is a very impressive
movie in that it is not willing
to sacrifice a sense of place
and reality for a more
uplifting story. In fact, it is
this commitment to the por-
trayal of the slum residents’
hardship that ultimately
elevates the film above
its moments of potentially
cliché Disney underdog
drama (perhaps it could
even be called a sports
drama, though the game of
chess may lie outside the
traditional boundaries of
as she starts defeating each
and every one of them at
chess.
It’s odd here that
messages such as “the
little person can become
the big person” don’t feel
anywhere near as eye-roll
inducing or hackneyed
as they might seem on
paper. Admittedly they
rarely come across as the
inspirational scene-defin-
ing moments they might
have been intended to be,
but they pass under the
viewer’s cheesiness-detec-
tor without setting off any

Phiona’s interest is
piqued one day on her
usual sales run by a small
crowd of children gathering
outside a hall. When she
follows them in she meets
Robert Katende (David
Oyelowo), participant in a
local missionary program,
football coach, and chess
coach, the latter being
the task Phiona finds him
performing in this hall. He
encourages her in, and
another young girl Gloria
(Nikita Waligwa) teaches
her the basics. She is capti-
vated when Gloria explains
the concept of ‘queening’ to
her (when a pawn reaches
an opponent’s side of the
board and can be swapped
out for a more valuable
piece), because as Gloria
explains, it means that “the
little person can become
the big person” From then
on she continues to return
to the hall to practise chess
with all her friends, and
though the other children
initially tease her for her
smell as she can’t afford to
wash herself, they get their
comeuppance one by one

clear through his confident,
enchanting directing and
stunning cinematography
which uses an abundance of
beautiful lingering fixed shots.
The minimalistic camerawork
is compounded by a quiet
piano soundtrack, played
at various points throughout
the film. One can argue that
no soundtrack would have fit
the premise of the film better,
but to its credit, the sprawling
beauty of a film does end
in silence. It allowed a short
period of reflection. A film
with such subject matter is
always at risk of being called
pretentious, and at the risk of
sounding so myself, the film
does leave you with a sense
of calm and a reassurance
in something deep down you
believed is true: life is becom-
ing very busy and you need
to take yourself out of it every
now and then. That might
have just been me, though,
as once the credits finished, a
woman behind me whispered
to her partner ‘well that was
unsubstantial twaddle’.
L
oosely based on a
book by George
Prochnik, In Pursuit
of Silence is a film
about how noise has
overtaken our lives and
why we need to treasure and
value silence. The opening
sequence conveys the level
of noise saturation in our
daily lives well. Various shots
of nature, still and quiet,
transition to a mass of people
in a public building observing
silence for Remembrance
Day, also still and quiet. At
the end of the two minutes,
the scene transforms. People
walking, talking, phones
ringing, escalators working,
doors opening, and traffic
moving lead to a sharp
contrast to what was just
observed. This is our daily
background noise, noise
which we have gotten used
to, noise we filter out, noise
we cope with.
The importance of silence
has been noticed by people
from all over the world and
from different walks of life,
ranging from Japanese monks
and tea servers to musicians
and environmental scientists.
The film uses their observa-
tions to convey how silence
benefits us both psycholog-
ically and physiologically,
whereas constant exposure to
noise is shown to be detrimen-
tal to our health. This noise is
also shown to be metaphor-
ical in the sense of constant
movement and doing. In an
age of constant connection to
everyone and everything, the
value of solitude and isolation
has been lost and the impor-
tance of this is highlighted.
As Pico Iyer said in the film, it
has gotten to such an extent
that we live “in a world of
movement, where stillness is
a luxury.” However, the film
puts across a strong argument
on why this is a luxury that is
necessary, and one everyone
should invest in. It is after all
a luxury that is free, you just
have to want it and set aside
time for it.

DOCUMENTARY OF THE WEEK
Broadcasting
your degree
At Imperial College London, a ‘science, technol-
ogy and medicine’ university, conveying scientific
information to the public and other academics
is an important part of the research conducted,
both for receiving more funding for further re-
search and to showcase major discoveries and
breakthroughs made. There’s also the fact that
everyone at Imperial loves their subject so much
they just want to tell people about it – and with
the rise of Netflix et al., what better way to show-
case your knowledge than through film.
Graduates from Imperial have had numerous suc-
cesses in making documentary films in the past
years. Here’s a list of some of the noteworthy
documentaries to be created by Imperial hands.
Powering the Top of
the World: Empowering
Communities (2014)
This documentary was
filmed by two PhD students
of Imperial, Chris Emmott
and Christoph Mazur. The
documentary was filmed
over two weeks and follows
an international energy
conference in Nepal as well
as interviews with officials
and locals to highlight the
issues and needs of a country
that has so much potential for
clean energy generation. It
won a prestigious TVE Global
Sustainability film award in
the Community investment
category.
Winds of Change
(2015)
This documentary created
by two Imperial Physics
researchers, Alex Bak and
Tomos Thomas, explores the
issues of climate change and
use of renewable energy
sources in Peru. They were
inspired by the creators of
Empowering Communities.

Solar Nation (2016)
Dr. Helena Wright, a
researcher at Imperial
College, created this
documentary about one of the
fastest growing solar markets
in the world: Bangladesh.
The documentary focuses
on people’s experiences,
the impact solar power and
electricity has had on their
lives, and what can be learnt
from their solar revolution.
Inside Nature’s Giants
(2009-2012)
This BAFTA award winning
documentary series was
created by a team which
included Alex Tate, a graduate
of Imperial’s Science Media
Production Masters course,
after completing a BSc in
Physics. The series focused on
the anatomy of some of the
largest creatures on Earth.
DNA: The Human Race
(2003)
Carlo Massarella won an
Emmy for his work on this
documentary. An imperial
graduate with a BSc in
Physics and an MSc in
Science Communication,
he solidifies the trend of the
previous documentaries. He
also wrote material for other
media such as magazines,
websites, and also a book to
accompany this documentary.
The documentary looks into
aspects of the human genome.

alarms of jarring the flow
of the scene. I’m still not
quite sure how we are told
that in life, “chess teaches
us to make a plan” and
that we must “find our safe
square and move towards
it”, and we calmly believe
it as we are told it, but
Queen of Katwe somehow
just makes it work. Perhaps
this is again down to the
sense of the realistic hard-
ship of the characters’ lives
portrayed throughout the
film.
It could also be due
to the script’s greatest
strength: its construction of
a complete and nuanced
network of characters.
Though Nalwanga’s perfor-
mance as Phiona is maybe
not the most gripping I’ve
seen this year, we get a
full picture of her as a
determined, quietly strong
young woman, with the
insecurities that keep her
relatable, understandable
and human. Her relation-
ship with her often-absent
sister is fantastically done,
but the dynamic between
her and her chess-playing
friends is even better. The
conversations they have,
the jokes they make, and
the struggles they pull each
other through never feel
forced, but as natural as a
group of friends in the real
world.
Best of all are the per-
formances of Nyong’o and
Oyelowo. Robert Katende
is a truly kind man, one
that may have seemed too
unrealistically perfect if
not for David Oyelowo’s
treatment of him – he is
not some inconceivable
living angel, but simply
a teacher who is good at
his job, dedicated with
all his heart to improving
the lives of others. There
is a scene (grounded in a
moral lesson, naturally) in
which he tells the children
the story of a dog chasing
a cat that plays out in
a single unbroken take,
and throughout the scene
I could not stop thinking
“good god, he is a fantastic
actor”. Lupita Nyong’o on
the other hand sheds her-
self of identity altogether
and truly becomes Phiona’s
harsh, overbearing mother.
Much the same can be said
of her performance that
was said by Roger Ebert of
Al Pacino’s performance
in Scent Of A Woman:
it is excellent yet “risky,
because at first the charac-
ter is so abrasive we can
hardly stand” her. (Like
most things about movies,
Roger Ebert said it better
than I ever could.)
A sense of sterile
production above all else
keeps this good film from
being a great one. It is
after all a Disney film, and
I’ve always found that
there is something about
the best Disney classics
that never quite trans-
lates into the live-action
world. We empathise with
the characters, but never
grieve for their troubles.
But director Mira Nair has
crafted an impressive twist
on the underdog sports
drama that is powerful in its
realism.
