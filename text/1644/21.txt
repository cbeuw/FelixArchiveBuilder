Plates of simple luxury
felix visits the refined Camino for a
relaxed brunch of spanish delights,
with crisp Patatas Bravas, inky Arroz
Negor and Baby squid. Oh, and a
bottle of cava for good measure.
a delicate unctuousness. The
Patatas Bravas was what I’ve
always dreamt of to accom-
pany my weekend fizz – the
potatoes are cut into precise
cuboids, with crispy edges
soaking in a slightly spicy
brava sauce and mellow aioli.
The Baby Aubergines, halved
and stuffed with a refreshing
mixture of tomato, onion,
coriander, mint and mojo
verde, gave balance to our
palettes for the other stronger
flavoured dishes.
We were torn between the
remaining two dishes as our
T
he luxury of Sunday
mornings. The only
morning in the week
when it is entirely
appropriate to put a
hush to the endless
list of unwatched Panopto
recordings, lie-in until the
church bells ring, then lazily
roll out of the house in time
for grocery shopping. Aside
from snatching the half-
priced flowers from Waitrose
to adorn my ill-maintained
window sill, another one
of my weekend leisures I
have grown to appreciate is
brunch.
Back in Hong Kong,
brunch is an odd trend
reserved for those hipster
cafés and high-end hotels,
normally populated by
expats, upper-middle class
20-somethings or those who
prefer soggy, overpriced
Pain Perdu over the Hong
Kong style French toast. (A
deep fried, inch-thick slab of
white bread drenched in egg
mixture, condensed milk and
golden syrup, plus a knob of
butter and a wallet-friendly
price of £2. What were they
thinking?)
Luckily in London, I’ve had
more than my fair share of
good brunches, from British
egg benedicts to American
pancakes, Indian naan rolls
to Israeli shakshuka. Here,
brunch isn’t a trend that will
dissipate after a few months
under the attack of some rain-
bow-coloured grilled cheese,
but simply a meal for one to
relax, catch up with friends
and getting ready for another
week (of 9 am lectures stuck
in a warm, stuffy lecture hall
like sardines) to come.
Two Sundays ago I had
the lucky opportunity to
be invited to Camino, a
mini-chain of Spanish tapas
restaurants, to review their
bottomless brunch menu.
Knowing that tapas are never
reserved for lonely diners,
I requested a plus one and
dragged my friend in the
wind and rain to Bankside,
where they have a branch
located conveniently in the
shadows of Tate Modern.
The exterior was exactly
what you’d want for the
window and studied the menu
while savouring their juicy,
home-marinated manzanilla
olives. We chose 3 tapas
each, and were presented
with our own bottle of cava to
share plus a carafe of orange
juice for mimosas.
The tapas arrived quickly
and filled the surface of the
table, transforming it into a
proper feast. The view, or
#tablesituation in Instagram
language, was spectacular.
6 tapas dishes in total with
a generous addition on the
house of a beautiful char-
cuteria platter with slices of
Iberico Cebo and Serrano
ham. Our gossiping was
replaced by a speechless
awe; we couldn’t wait to
dig into the arrangement of
colours, textures and smells
displayed before us.
The Crispy Baby Squid
was served as tender, lightly
battered bites with the cutest
pot of aioli on the side. My
friend couldn’t get enough

perfect chilled hang out under
the wet rays of October
sunlight: a few shrubs here
and there, comfortable sofas
and red blankets laid out
thoughtfully to fight against
the chilly breeze. Upon
entrance, we were greeted by
an unexpected serenity for a
Sunday afternoon, which was
then broken by the cheery
manager, waiters and relaxed
music.
After a quick introduction,
we chose our table next to the
of this even when we were
absolutely stuffed towards the
end. The Arroz Negro, their
signature dish, was a creamy,
comforting risotto in an entic-
ing jet black sauce – made
with squid ink, which gives
favourite. My friend crowned
the juicy, flavourful Iberico
Meatballs while I took the rest
of the Tortilla de Patatas, with
its slightly sweet, runny eggs
sandwiched between layers
of potatoes. Two hours in
and we were still eating; the
excited munching turned into
nibbles between sips of cava
and gossip, dictated by our
satisfied stomachs.
Wait. Did I say we were
stuffed? I take that back.
We had to have something
sweet to finish off the hours
of relaxation. We went for
a portion of Chocolate con
Churros to share. The churros
were fried to order, dusted
with icing sugar and came
stylishly stacked next to a pot
of rich, velvety, dark choco-
late sauce. I could eat just this
all day – fresh, hot, crunchy
and… chocolate.
I couldn’t recommend
this enough for a delicious,
good-valued brunch for a
small group of friends or a
cosy date.
