mperial College Handball
managed to secure first
place at the annual
Fresher’s Tournament,
which is considered by
many as the unofficial
beginning of the Handball
battle amongst London
Universities. It took place
in the Olympic Copperbox
arena and hosted teams
from London’s top handball
universities: University
College London (UCL), King’s
College London, Brunel,
Middlesex and of course,
Imperial. Despite its friendly
nature the tournament
presented some intensive
games.
The Eagles started with a
very physical game against
Middlesex. The team’s
offensive worked very well
throughout, however the
lack of experience playing
together in defence led
to a well fought-out draw
(6-6). The second game
was against UCL: despite
playing brilliantly in attack
and fighting well in defence,
Imperial’s team managed
to get their first win of the
night (6-5). Next up were the
Eagles’ fiercest rivals, King’s.
Improved communication
between players was instru-
mental in the victory (8-7) that
nearly secured the title. In the
last game of the tournament,
Imperial faced Brunel. A win
would secure the trophy, how-
ever, losing by no more than
one goal would also suffice.
After an intense game, Brunel
managed to steal a victory
(3-4), but since the loss for
Imperial was by only one
goal, it was enough to secure
the trophy for the Eagles.
The victory came despite
an injured team captain,
Jakub Szypicyn. Resembling
Cristiano Ronaldo during
the recent European football
championship final, he played
the role of a coach and nav-
igated the team throughout
the tournament. His actions
on the sideline were key to

Doctors (dD) took
part in the annual
SICKO Indoors
Ultimate Frisbee tournament
held in Brighton from the 8th
to the 9th
of October 2016.
Things weren’t looking
great for us at the start. It
was the first week back at
University and it dawned
on us that summer was
officially over. With looming
deadlines, housing issues and
Freshers’ week hangovers
weighing us down, it was
hard to get excited for a
weekend of Ultimate Frisbee.
However, we rose above
such downtrodden attitudes
and pushed forward with a
paper thin squad of eight.
On day one, we played two
pool games, our first being
against team IRN BREW
(yes, the Scottish orange
drink) which comprised of
a healthy amount of very
experienced players. They
took the first half from us with
ease, but we came back with
vengeance and finished just
two points behind. Shortly
after, we played the Brighton
University alumni who go by
the name Retired Squaws.
Using our young, fresh legs,
we scored quickly and took
the lead early on in the game.
Despite a scrappy second
half, our initial lead helped
carry us to victory. The third
and final game we played
was a crossover match versus
the Skunks, which we calmly
played and eventually won
to secure our place in the top
eight.
On day two, we fiercely
contested all our games,
coming home with a final
tally of two wins and one

O
n the
weekend
of the 14th
of October,
Imperial
Windsurfers
travelled down to Roadford
lake in Devon to join the first
student windsurfing festival
of the academic year: Aussie
Kiss 15. The event was hosted
by the Student Windsurfing
Association (SWA) and is
the first of six core events. 18
Imperial windsurfers joined
in the festivities, breaking
all past attendance records
of the club. More than 350
students from 30 universities
up and down the UK were in
attendance.
With strong winds on
Sunday and mild ones on
Saturday, both advanced and
beginner windsurfers enjoyed
a great time on the lake.
Susie McAllister, Charlotte
Flower, Jon Platts, Ryan
Dooze and Athena Wang all
took part and impressed the
instructors, including our very
own President, David Salmon.
David was awarded ‘Best
Instructor’ of the weekend
and was gifted a free
instructor course and some
great products.
The rest of the group
comprised a mixture of
intermediate and advanced
windsurfers who took full
advantage of the demo kit
Boardwise brought to the
event. The racing was held
on Sunday. Imperial entered
three members into the
team race: Artur Banach,
Dolores Garcia and Jerome
de Chillaz. The team did
immensely well coming
second in their heat, gaining
a place in the final, and
finishing 6th
overall.
Each SWA event has a
fancy dress night and this
year was no exception.
Aussie Kiss 15’s theme
was ‘The Circus’, where
an appropriately shaped
tent was set up next to the
campsite, ready for the night.
Imperial decided on ‘Freak
Show’ with the majority of
the group dressing up as
conjoined twins, attracting a
lot of attention from the other
Universities.

XV turned up
to a surprisingly calm
Harlington, looking
for their first victory of
the season against the
University of Surrey.
With stand-in skipper Mike
Wright choosing to go against
the wind and the slope, IC
started strongly with the new
structure appearing to work
successfully. The Front Row
Union were heavily involved
from the start with neat
handling along with debutant
Adam Dowkes, making some
strong carries.
The IC pressure eventually
began to tell, closing in on
what would have been a
first score, despite a dubious
knock-on decision. Strong
carries from Jerome Hallet,
Jack Dunning and Charles
Price-Smith, an audacious
between-the-legs pass from
Henry ‘The Horse Master’
Allingham, and great calls
from James ‘The Field Ratio’
Field edged IC closer to the
line, leading to Oli Parker
crossing following a grubber
through from Field. However,
he was unfortunately pulled
back for being offside.
The pressure was
maintained with IC winning
a penalty and the ball being
sent into the corner. The
lineout, which has been
dysfunctional at times this
season (this, of course, has

nothing to do with the hooker
throws, I hasten to add), was
won successfully and a maul
set up with Lord Allingham
galloping over for the first
score. 5-0 at half time, a
good start.
The second half started
with a similar theme of IC
dominance. Constant pressure
resulted in infringements and
more IC lineouts. The score
went to 10-0 when Wright
scored from another lineout
after peeling away from a
maul and crashing over from
five metres out.
IC substitutions were made
with forgotten man Tom
Marvin entering the fray.
Surrey were growing into the
game late on just as IC’s struc-
ture was falling away. This led
to numerous opportunities for
Surrey, with them missing a
simple kick but eventually get-

penalty try. Suddenly all the
momentum shifted and Surrey
quickly found the try-line
again following a breakaway
down the left wing, taking
the score to 10-14 with 10
minutes remaining. IC could
not get back into the game,
with Wright also falling to the
captain’s curse after losing a

correctly). The match ended a

our final success.
Since many players of the
2015/16 team graduated
last year, this team was
assembled in just two training
sessions, but the improving
communication and team
bonding was noticeable
throughout the evening.
What many might have
thought was a new team
in the beginning seemed
a single unit by the end.
This incredible success
gives hope to everyone in
the squad. Will the Eagles
be able to overcome the
odds and win the London
University Sports League this
year, despite their sub-par
performances last season?
Only time will tell, but our first
trophy certainly shows posi-
tive signs of things to come.
