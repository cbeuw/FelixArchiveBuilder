A premature follow up | Emma Rice steps
down from her role as Globe director By Jack Steadman
T
here is a depressing
if predictable irony
to the fact that,
within hours of
this article being
completed, the
Globe’s board went and
pushed out their female
artistic director. On Tuesday
morning, it was announced
that Emma Rice will be
stepping down from her role
in April 2018, following the
close of the 17/18 season.
Not only this, but with Rice
goes “the current nature of
work, which has character-
ised the period since Emma
assumed the position”. That is
to say, all of the modernising
(new lights and actual sound
system), the shaking up and
reinventing of the texts, it’s all
going away in April 2018.
This decision has been
dressed up as a decision
purely about the intended
purpose of the Globe vis
In a time when all-female casts are still seen as a gimmick Jack Steadman discusses the
importance of bending and breaking original texts and taking gender off the list of casting
specifications
\\ Does that then
mean that all of
Shakespeare’s roles
can be played by
anyone, of any
gender? It’s a
question that has an
obvious answer –
yes, of course they
can \\
the question. Do Lloyd’s three
productions, all part of one
big project, really work as
evidence for women being
able to play male roles? Just
because it was successful in
this case, and an extreme
case at that, does that then
mean that all of Shake-
speare’s roles can be played
by anyone, of any gender?
S
hakespeare. “Who
owns Shakespeare?
“. This is the idea
Phyllida Lloyd and
company set out
to challenge with
her all-female production of
Julius Caesar at the Donmar
Warehouse in 2012.
It’s easy to dismiss that
move as a gimmick, a knock-
off copy of the all-male
Shakespeare productions
that pop up like clockwork,
but with none of the historical
authenticity those produc-
tions claim to wield. However
such dismissal would be mis-
guided, both when it comes
to intentions and results. Lloyd
accepted that first directing
job at the Donmar Ware-
house on the basis that she
would like to direct something
with a cast that would be
at least half female, before
realising that she actually
wanted to go even further in
addressing theatre’s gender
imbalance. And as for results,
by virtually all accounts, the
play was a success, with win-
ning reviews and contented
audiences across the board.
Of course, success doesn’t
actually make all-female
Shakespeare not a gimmick
per se. But it does make it
successful, on this occasion
anyway. Regardless, Lloyd
and company returned to
all-female Shakespeare
in 2014 with a produc-
tion of Henry IV (also at
the Donmar), which was
announced to be the second
part in what would now be
a trilogy of all-female pro-
ductions directed by Lloyd.
Similarly praised, similarly
successful, and (depressingly)
still seemingly against the
norm.
And now, two years later,
we’re at the final part: Lloyd’s
all-female The Tempest has
opened – not at the Donmar,
but at a new, purpose-built,
in-the-round theatrical space
at King’s Cross (if you want
your gimmick, there it is. Pop-
up, purpose-built theatres). All
signs so far point to a similar
result of critical praise and
audience adulation. But does
that mean they can be taken
as proof that women can
handle Shakespeare’s biggest
roles as well as the men?
Michael Billington, The
Guardian’s lead critic, in
his mostly positive review
of that 2012 production of
Julius Caesar, suggests that
its success doesn’t mean “we
should get carried away and
start arguing that single-sex
Shakespeare is the only way
forward.” He does have a
point. All-male Shakespeares
run the risk of dissolving
into what can only be called
historical intellectual mastur-
bation, becoming trapped
by their slavish loyalty to the
original production. There
is nothing more boring than
a Shakespeare with nothing
interesting to say, and you
certainly can’t accuse an
all-female Shakespeare of
that.
But ‘not boring’ alone
doesn’t really help answer
It’s a question that has an
obvious answer – yes, of
course they can – but it seems
to have taken the world of
theatre an awfully long time
to get there.
Julius Caesar was a theatri-
cal revelation when it landed,
but it’s hard to escape the
sense that it still feels like an
abnormality in the general
currents of male-drive Shake-
speare. The words “all-female
Shakespeare” do not feel
instantly at home, do not
inspire the general indiffer-
ence that greets “all-male
Shakespeare”. The all-female
Tempest still feels like a big
deal. But it’s not like females
tackling Shakespeare is new.
Take Hamlet. The Crown
Prince of Denmark is quite
possibly the goal in theatre
for any young, aspiring
actor. But that hasn’t stopped
Hamlet being played by
women – as early as 1777,
Sarah Siddons was playing
the prince in Manchester,
while in the same year as
Lloyd’s Henry IV, Maxine
Peake appeared as Hamlet
in a production at the Royal
Exchange, in Manchester
yet again. It can and does
happen but it’s not exactly
a daily occurrence. Peake
was the first female Hamlet
in thirty-five years. That
being said, the current crop
of shows in London theatres
does seem to suggest that
things might finally be on
the mend. As The Tempest
plays in the Donmar’s new
King’s Cross theatre, over
the river in Waterloo the Old
Vic is staging King Lear with
veteran actress Glenda Jack-
son in the title role. Billed as
Jackson’s return to the stage
(after a good few decades
away serving as an MP), the
production goes up against
a more traditional one by the
Royal Shakespeare Company,
with Anthony Sher in the
same role. Neither production
reduces the other – if any-
thing, the prospect of seeing
two titans of the field try their
hand at the role should have
Shakespeare-loving audi-
ences salivating.
Further east along the river,
over at Shakespeare’s Globe,
things have ventured even
further from the traditional –
and, admittedly, away from
the subject of women playing
men (and instead into the
realm of just redefining the
texts around the women).
Under new artistic director
Emma Rice, the theatre has
taken a bold new approach
to the texts, unafraid to try
unconventional approaches
where previously they fol-
lowed a more softly authentic
approach (particularly under
Castingwomeninmalerolesisnotagimmick Mark Rylance). This has thus
far culminated in Imogen –
a production of Cymbeline
that shifts the focus onto
King Cymbeline’s daughter,
Imogen (who actually has
more lines than the king in the
original text, since you didn’t
ask), and renames the whole
thing more appropriately in
the process. And if the Globe,
the very home of Shake-
speare in London and (along
with the RSC) the authority on
Shakespearean productions,
can pull off something like
that, then why can’t everyone
else? When will we see the
likes of Ophelia? Actually,
that’s a bit of a trick question:
we already have seen it in the
case of Ophelia, in a produc-
tion by Katie Mitchell at the
Royal Court earlier this year,
but I digress.
We are still in the phase
where seeing women play
the likes of Hamlet, Lear,
Prospero and Macbeth does
still feel, despite itself, a little
like a gimmick. It’s ultimately
an unfortunate side-effect
of their rarity, and until such
gender-blind casting becomes
the norm, it’ll probably con-
tinue to feel that way. But that
doesn’t diminish the power,
urgency, and thrill of the
switch, and it certainly doesn’t
render them innately bad or
wrong. And sure, there will
be the odd bum performance,
just as there is with their
countless male equivalents.
One of the many joys of
theatre, but especially of
Shakespeare, is the way the
original text can be bent,
broken, and reforged into
something new with every
production. The story may
stay the same, but through
changes in setting, in casting,
// Rafael Martínez
in any one of many factors,
the play can be found anew.
Casting women in the ‘male’
roles of the play is just one
way to achieve that – but it’s
also a way that provides the
added bonus of seeing some
of our greatest actors tackle
some of our greatest roles.
Seeing women take on the
mantles previously expected
to be worn only by men feels
a vis Shakespeare and his
original productions – “a
radical experiment to
explore the conditions within
which Shakespeare and his
contemporaries worked”, as
the board’s statement put it.
Such a claim – coming as it
does with remarks that future
programming “should be
structured around ‘shared
light’ productions without
designed sound and light rig-
ging” – feels an awful lot like
window-dressing for a sadly
backwards attitude from the
Globe.
This is all despite
acknowledging that the
“mould-breaking work” of
Rice had achieved “strong
box office returns”, which
is no mean feat in a theatre
like the Globe, which sells
about 90% of the available
tickets as standard, and the
new, diverse audiences being
attracted there.
Fundamentally, while the
Globe’s board may have a
point in there somewhere –
specifically the one about
being founded to explore
the original circumstances
of Shakespeare – this can’t
help but feel like a mixture
of a complete cock-up and
a missed opportunity. The
board inescapably knew
what they were getting when
they appointed Rice – you
don’t appoint an artistic
director without coming to
some kind of agreement on
their vision for a theatre. To
back down now, like this, is
just cowardly and pathetic.
And that’s all before you get
into the fact that Rice is – was
– one of few female artistic
directors in the country, and
one in charge of Shake-
speare’s Globe at that. You
couldn’t have made a better
statement about how theatre
– all theatre – is for every-
one, of all genders, at a time
when it feels like theatre might
finally be moving towards
redressing the balance.
Now, of course, that
statement just starts to feel
like maybe theatre is the
small-minded, boys-only club
everyone thought it might be.
