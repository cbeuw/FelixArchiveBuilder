of the superstars competing
in the championships such as

W
hat is it
about
ballroom
dancing
that so
enthrals
us? The public’s fascination
with ballroom dancing began
years ago in Hollywood,
with Fred Astaire and Ginger
Rogers lighting up the silver
screen. And as the wild
success of TV programs like
Strictly Come Dancing and
Dancing With The Stars
shows, its glamour and
wear?
Whatever it is, the craze for
ballroom dancing has spread
over the globe. I myself am
no stranger to its charms,
having started dancing
at Imperial on a whim in
first year. One thing led to
another, and before I knew
it I had five pairs of dance
shoes and was spending most
evenings a week practicing in
the JCR! Incidentally, one of
Imperial’s best-kept secrets is
the second life the JCR takes
on after dark. The tables are
pushed aside, the floor swept
clean of the day’s dust, and
dancing couples trace figures
across the room till security
comes to chase them away.
For those unfamiliar with
dancesport, there are two
broad styles of ballroom
dance: Standard and Latin,
with five dances in each style.
Standard (slow waltz, tango,
quickstep, foxtrot and Vien-
nese waltz) is characterised
by elegant sweeping steps
danced in closed hold across
the dance floor, whereas Latin
(cha-cha, jive, samba, rumba,
paso doble) is known more
for its sensuality and energy.
As the two styles are quite
different, each style is judged
separately in competitions,
and couples – especially at
the professional level – often
choose to specialise in one
style or the other.
One of the most important
events in competitive danc-
esport was held at the Royal
Albert Hall a fortnight ago.
Once a year for the last 64
years, the best ballroom
dancers from around the
world gather to vie for the
honour of being crowned
World Champion. I had
secured my tickets before
summer, and was immensely
excited to be attending the
International Championships
live for the first time! Anyone
familiar with competitive
dancesport would have heard
the World Professional Latin
title for 14 years), was on the
judging panel, as were many
other renowned dancers
who had moved to judging
and teaching after their com-
petitive heyday. I was quite
star-struck to be in such close
proximity to these legends,
seeing them live and even
breathing the same air.
Yes, one would almost have
envied the RAH floor, such
was the number of incredible
dancers that graced it that
evening. But for me there was
one couple that really mat-
tered. Marika Doshoris and
Gunnar Gunnarsson, repre-
senting the United Kingdom in
the Latin Professional Champi-
onships! Amazingly enough,
Marika is the Latin coach at
IC Dance Club; it is quite an
honour to have been taught
by her since I was a beginner
in first year. The Marika we
see at regular dance practice
is an incredible dancer, but to
see her dancing competitively
was truly something else.
Small wonder, then, that IC
Dance team members were
out in full force to support her
at the Internationals. It was
rather amusing to hear our
enthusiastic roars of “Marika!
Gunnar!” resound through
the Royal Albert Hall despite
the stares from the more
sedate and proper audience
members.
In addition to the
professional category, the
International Champion-
ships also include a second
category for amateurs. This
refers to dancers who do not
dance full-time and teach
professionally for a living.
While professional ballroom
dancers, the sort one sees on
Strictly, often begin dancing
at the ridiculously early ages
of five or six, the amateur
category encompasses those
who might pick up ballroom
dancing later on in life or
who cannot do it as a full-time

a student dancer might still
hope to achieve.
The World Championships
traditionally concludes with
the jive of the final Latin
round, it being the fastest,
most upbeat and energetic
dance. But the mood after the
final jive took a sombre turn
this year. Maurizio Vescovo,
one of the most well-known
Latin dancers from across the
pond, announced his official
retirement from competitive
dancing in an emotional letter
addressed to the dancesport
community. Having seen him
first in videos and then live
during Internationals, I felt
the floor would not be the
same without his presence.
He was a unique character,
with a playful, interactive
style that contrasted with the
classic Latin dancers around
him. Though opinion on him
beauty has captured our
imagination ever since. Is
it the beauty of the figures
danced in tandem? The
delight of seeing movement
and music perfectly aligned?
Or even the dazzling
costumes that the dancers
commitment. This would
include students who started
ballroom dancing at univer-
sity, like myself and many
other members of IC Dance.
In fact, two couples from the
IC Dance Team went to the
early rounds of the amateur
Internationals! Unlike the
professional dancers who

may be divided, there is no
question that he managed to
define a strong personal style
that stood out on the dance
floor. And this is something
that I feel is important, espe-
cially in ballroom dancing.
With all the strict rules in this
form of dance (Feet turned
out! Lift that hip higher!) it
is all too easy to forget that
dance remains intrinsically a
form of expression. I like to
think of ballroom dancing as
one would think of a sonnet.
Despite the fixed structure, it
is within these confines – or
even using these confines –
that one finds the freedom to
be oneself.
And the results of the
Championships? Marika
and Gunnar were ranked
in the top ten in the world
– no mean feat! Riccardo
and Yulia won the World
Professional Latin Champion-
ships for the 3rd
time, while
Victor and Anastasia were
crowned World Professional
Ballroom Champions for the
first time. Yet these results fall
flat on paper. How can one
describe the flashes of Yulia’s
exquisite footwork, or the
way Victor and Anastasia
swept gracefully across the
floor? Watching them, I was
reminded once again of the
magic behind why I, along
with so many other people,
love ballroom dancing.
