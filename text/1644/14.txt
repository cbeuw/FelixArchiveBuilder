Music is an amazingly powerful way to impact a message to an
audience, a community or even a generation. Women have
traditionally been a marginalized and oppressed social group and
in our modern society, we still face prejudices unknown to our male
counterparts. In the spirit of ‘Imperial Girls Can’, I’ve listened to the
fiery Felix Feminist Power Playlist and here are my first impressions
and what I’ve learnt from these songs.

Cant’ Hold Us Down

Listen to this when: you
want to refute someone’s
‘witty’ remark. As females,
there’s no doubt that we’ve
all experienced some kind
of sexism. Sometimes, it
feels easier to ignore the
stupidity after a long day.
However, we have to tackle
the underlying issue. After
listening to this song, you’ll be
ready to obliterate whatever
nonsensical stupidity comes
your way.
Listen to this when: someone
(or you yourself) tries to
devalue your achievements.
As an eight year old, I
remember listening to this and
thinking nothing of the power
rhetoric this song relates. But
now, ten years later, it has a
whole new meaning – while
your achievements in life are
your own, the obstacles may
not be. However, you have to
believe in yourself before you
can overcome whatever lies
in your way. When you take
responsibility, you ultimately
see results.
Listen to this when: you’re
feeling sassy. This song never
ceases to send chills down my
spine. At some point in life, it is
inevitable that we will encounter
rude, obnoxious or arrogant
behavior (it’s everyday on
London transport). Instead of
fighting fire with fire, put on
this song and simply outclass
the source of offence. Integrity
simply attracts respect.
Listen to this when: life’s
challenges make you want to
give up.
Nobody starts from the top.
In classic early 2000s style, in
this song Nicki Minaj iterates
the importance of sharing
the story of your journey,
struggles, tears and sweat. It’s
so easy to look at the finished
results and forget the pain it
took to get there. Whatever
you want to do, you can do
it and you will do it. Go forth
and make it happen.
Listen to this when: you’re sick of watching the news. How do
you deal with something hideously absurd? With something
wonderfully so. Russian feminist punk rock protest group
have struck back at Trump with an instant classic. “The
owner of vaginas is not some narcissistic stupid orange
ape who’d claim that he could easily grab women by their
pussies. The owner of vagina is a woman. Who wears her
vag as a badge of honour.”

Listen to this when: someone
makes a idiotic or ignorant
comment. Hard Out Here is a
rather comedic rebuttal to the
objectification of women. After
all, when you can laugh at
the labels people give to you,
you’re a million times closer to
overcoming them.
