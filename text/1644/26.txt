CANCER
VIRGO
This week you
are choosing your
Halloween outfit but
there are only a few
shitty ones left. You buy
one in a hurry and turn
up to your crush’s party
as sexy Hitler. No one is
impressed.

PISCES
AQUARIUS
SAGITTARIUS
SCORPIO

GEMINI
TAURUS
ARIES
This week you
order a latte
and get served a
cappuccino. The
world hates you,
clearly.
This week you’re an
Uber driver patrolling
South Ken after closing
time at metric. I’m so
sorry. I can only assume
you committed some
atrocities/war crimes/
were a Kardashian in a
previous life.
This week you’re the
Great British Bakeoff
tent, now empty on
the inside. Like Paul
Hollywood. Fucking
Judas.
This week you turn
up to the IC Girls Can
Kangoo jump session
without long socks. How
you gunna burn dem
calories now?
This week you
throw dog food
out the window.
Nobody seems to be
joining you, I guess
nobody’s really into
#FreeTheKibble?
This week your long
lost son contacts you,
claiming that one of your
many flings in the past
resulted in their birth.
Whilst you feel happy
to have met him, you do
think it’s a bit weird that
he’s 45 whilst you’re a
fresher. He seems nice
though.
This week you’re a
fresher at the first ACC.
Initiations start off small
but escalate quickly.
You wake up the
following morning with
a tattoo of Alice Gast
on your bum. You feel
complete.
This week you hear
your house is going
to be bulldozed for
Heathrow. At least you
get to be on Project
Runway!
This week you buy
a broken calculator
in the Union shop,
but Brexit means your
consumer rights only
work in French. Better
get to Horizons.
This week you’re a Hall
Warden, adamant that
nobody ever takes drugs.
You start burning copies
of the felix drug section
and single handedly end
the war on drugs. At
least that explains where
all the copies went last
week too.
This week you try to
draw a nipple without
any reference. You
realise nipples look like
hats and proceed to
laugh silly at the idea
of nature equipping
us with breast hats to
keep them warm in
winter.
CAPRICORN
CRISIS
Chris
Dear Chris,
I’m struggling! My lab partner is pretty much unbeara-
ble – he keeps talking over me interrupting me. It’s clear
that most of the time he has absolutely no idea what he’s
talking about, but he’ll rush in front of me, interrupt and
then make mistakes I have to deal with. When I correct
him, he is clearly butt hurt and just sulks for the hour. He
only ever refers to me as little miss, and tells me I ought to
have a tailored lab coat. He is terrible at communicating
and I’m sick of having to mollycoddle him. Whenever I try
to explain to him why his behaviour is unacceptable, he
tells me I’m being emotional and irrational, and wont even
consider that his mansplaining is out of order.
Best wishes,
Tess Choob
OH darling!
Honey, this isn’t REALLY mansplaining. Mans-
plaining is when somebody (a man or woman)
explains something to somebody (a man or a
woman) in a condescending way! It doesn’t
have to be a man to a woman! Not ALL men
do this, anyway, and women do it too. I think
what you’ve written is actually sexist. Maybe
your coat is just too big for you? I think he’s
just looking out for you, really, and you should
thank him. The most important opinions to
you should be the ones you’ve never asked or
cared for!
HOROSCOPES
Even if he was being rude, and I don’t think he
is, this guy is clearly the exception. You should
toughen up and find a way to deal with it.
Have a sense of humour and it will make you
stronger. It’s clearly a problem that you’re too
sensitive, and you need to deal with this before
you go into the world of work. There will be
differences of opinion wherever you, and
dealing with that is just part of growing up. If
you haven’t done that yet, I guess you are a
little miss!
Big luv
Chris
