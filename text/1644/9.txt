A study investigating the psychological effects of lucid dreaming on patients suffering from
nightmare disorders may offer an insight into treatments, and provide insight into how the
sleeping brain works
A
n American
paper
published
last month
investigated
how so-
called ‘lucid dreaming’ may
help to devise treatments of
nightmare disorders and other
psychological conditions.
The idea is that sufferers
may be able to re-program
their nightmares into neutral
or positive experiences
by gaining control over
their dream world. Turning
negative dreams into positive
experiences is not a new idea
in the field of psychology,
previously shown to be fairly
effective in treating PTSD
sufferers.
Imagery rehearsal therapy
(IR) is one technique already
being used to help turn bad
dreams caused by trau-
matic exposure into positive
experiences. It is still unclear
how the therapy works or
how lucid dreaming may
be involved. Although a
complicated concept, lucid
dreaming is described by
the authors of this particu-
lar paper as the “reflective
awareness and metacognitive
monitoring of an ongoing
dream”. In other words, it is
the ability to become aware
had some level of passive
dream awareness during their
dreams. The results showed
that during IR therapy the
lucid dreamers who could
control the content of their
dreams had significantly
reduced nightmare distress
compared to other groups.
This may indicate that ‘dream
content control’ is underlying
this and that there is some
connection between lucid
dreaming ability and the
effectiveness of this therapy.
Despite this, the study was
quite small (only 33 people)
and lucid dreaming is difficult
to measure. Although only
one small study, it brings up
interesting questions about
the power of the human mind
and the elusive line between
dream and reality.

How subjects achieve this
and how evidence for success
can be harnessed are more
complex questions.
If this kind of control is
possible, it would make sense
to use it to re-program disturb-
ing dreams and thereby the
underlying emotional state
of individuals, especially in
PTSD or other psycholog-
ical conditions that cause
nightmares. In this study, the
authors aimed to investigate
how lucid dreaming may be
involved in IR therapy by com-
paring “nightmare distress”
in groups with differing lucid
dream constructs. One group
had actual control over their
dream content, others just
Is lucid dreaming a cure for nightmares?
T
-cell acute
lymphoblastic
leukaemia (T-ALL)
is a fast progressive
type of blood
cancer that affects
white blood cells, especially
those activating antibody-
producing cells. It affects both
children and adults and since
it is in the blood, cancerous
cells can also move to and
affect other organs of the
body.
Despite chemotherapy
being the most common
cancer treatment, it is not
fully effective, with relapse
common in leukemia patients
specifically. Dr Christina Lo
Celso, a researcher at Impe-
rial College London in the
Department of Life Sciences
explains: “Relapse is caused
by cancer cells that are resist-
ant to chemotherapy and we
had thought that there would
be a special place in the
body where these cells would
reside.” Her group is trying
to understand the interactions
of leukemia cells with their
surrounding micro-environ-
ment within bone marrow,
building on previous studies
suggesting they may evade
the body’s immune system
by ‘hiding’ amongst blood
stem cells. New research in
mice, validated with human
scientists and as Dr Lo Celso
adds, “Now that we know
that the cells don’t hide, we
can explore why that is and
how their movement helps
them to survive. Ultimately
we want to find out whether
we can stop the movement,
and whether this could kill the
treatment-resistant cells.”
The study is still at early
stages but it may justify why
previous attempts to treat leu-
kemia have failed, suggesting
a change of approach in the
field.
Future research at Imperial
will be focused on under-
standing whether slowing
down the chemo-resistant
cells makes them more likely
to be destroyed and whether
continuous migration across
tissues is a hallmark of other
types of leukemia too. This
will shed light on the interac-
tion of cancerous cells with
their environment, potentially
lead to new therapeutic
approaches.

tain leukaemia cells are more

thought, they don’t hide in one
place.
The leukemia cells were
seen to be actively moving in
bone marrow, with movement
speeding up post-treatment.
