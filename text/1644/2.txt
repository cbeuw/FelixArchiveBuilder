Onnudityandnipples
W
e’re all born naked. If there’s
one thing that unites us it’s that.
Take away our clothes and pack
us in a room and soon enough,
we’ll turn into one big mass
of flesh, individuality stripped
away along with the fabrics we so fondly wrap
ourselves in. Maybe that’s why nudity has so much
power still. Power to shock, move, inspire. Nudity
causes a reaction, which is why we use nudity to sell
products, ideas and papers *wink*.
So, it’s interesting to see how social factors affect
the acceptance of nudity, how some naked bodies are
more welcome than others. The social perception of
nudity reveals many things about our social condition.
Let’s take the humble nipple, a tiny flap of skin which
has been causing so much controversy. Despite the fact
that nipples don’t look particularly different across the
two sexes, female nipples receive radically different
treatment. While male nippels are a casual feature
of everyday normality, female nipples are censored,
refelcting the treatment of women in our seemingly
progressive western society,
The free the nipple movement has come under a lot of
criticism, but the critics fail to understand that despite
the name and campaign strategy, the movement is not
about nipples; it’s about freedom.
The nipple is just a symbol. Freeing the nipple is not
just about flesh, it’s about changing a mindframe. It’s
about freeing women.
This week, just like every other week we have
produced a centrefold. Some nipples are visible and
some are not. Nothing has changed.
So, if you find our centrefold offensive in any way,
take a hard look at the reasons driving your feelings.
If you don’t, and find the #freethenipple campaign ‘so
2014’, well – good. Making a big deal out of a nipple
is boring and doesn’t belong in the 21st
century.
