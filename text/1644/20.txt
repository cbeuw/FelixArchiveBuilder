Humans
2.0: Human
Harder
Anurag Deshpande
Humans made a big splash
when it launched last year.
Its compelling performances
and intriguing premise made
it a must-watch. Ahead of the
launch of the second season
this Sunday, felix lets you
know if it retains the quality of
the first.
A
fter Humans
first premiered
in the summer
of 2015, few
knew what
exactly to
expect. The show clearly had
significant acting clout behind
it, and its subtle marketing
campaign was quick to
pique the interest of the
viewing public. Sure enough,
the series managed to live
up to, and even surpass,
its hype: an increasingly
uncommon feat these days.
It rapidly became one of the
powerhouses of Channel
4’s prime-time arsenal, and
a second season was soon
in the works. felix had the
opportunity to watch the first
episode of season 2, ahead
of its airing this Sunday. You
might be wondering how
we managed that. Well, it’s
a long and fascinating tale
involving laughter, adventure,
and signing lots of NDAs.
Anyways, how does it hold
up? Well, from what I’ve
seen, season 2 raises the
stakes without compromising
the quality. 		
Episode 1 picks up the loose
plot threads from the first
season, as both the Synths
and the Hawkins family
attempt to construct some
semblance of normal lives
following their ordeal. The
Synths stop running and begin
to discover the complexities
of both the outside world and
themselves. On this front, the
writing is subtle and layered.
Experiences and exchanges
are constructed to evoke
memories and a realisation
of what the Synths are
entering; adolescence. The
poignancy of these moments
comes precisely from the
fact that tropes are leaned
into gently, and the point
is not shoved in your face.
The performances on this
front, as you might expect,
are by-and-large beyond
reproach. The Hawkins
family plot-line, for its part,
brings from season one the
undercurrents of human
resentment for increasing
workforce mechanisation into
the limelight. To the show’s
credit, it uses quite a variety
of plot points, some quite
insidious, to address these
concerns. However, it does
stray a bit into cliché when
dealing with this storyline.
That’s not necessarily a
bad thing though, and
given the overall strength
of the writing, I’m willing to
give the writers the benefit
of the doubt. In addition,
certain events towards the
episode’s close ensure that
Laura Hawkins will have a
major part to play in events
going forward. It seems
as if Katherine Parkinson,
who by the way is fantastic
in person, will have ample
opportunity to flex her acting
muscles. Lucy Carless, Pixie
Davies, and Theo Stevenson
don’t, unfortunately, get
much to do this episode but
turn in typically high-calibre
performances, regardless.
Pixies Davies in particular,
considering her age, is one of
the strongest child actors I’ve
seen, right alongside Mad
Men’s Kiernan Shipka or the
stars of Outnumbered.
Considering that Humans was
a joint production between
AMC and Channel 4, season
one was relatively UK-centric.
Its excellent performance last
year has clearly bolstered the

financiers’ faith, as the series
plays out on a much more
global scale this time. The
ever-versatile Carrie-Anne
Moss takes on the recurring
role of Dr. Athena Morrow, a
leading AI researcher. While
her plot-line was certainly
engaging, and shows much
promise, it was a bit lower on
the philosophical metaphors
than the others. None of that
is to knock Moss herself, who
conducts herself with enough
duplicity and flexibility to
ensure that Morrow will be
someone to keep an eye on
this season.			
The sublime and heavy
on synths (no pun intended)
80s retro-futurist soundtrack
makes a triumphant return.
There’s also the great
cinematography and
direction to mention. The
imagery in this episode is
rich and makes extensive use
of visual metaphors. One
particular such metaphor
near the beginning, involving
a mine-shaft, is particularly
worth praising.		
The first episode of this
season throws up a number
of balls into the air for the
series to juggle alongside
those still left from season
one. It is fast-paced,
interesting, and manages to
successfully set-up and tease
even bigger things to come.
If you’re a fan of Humans,
or just considering checking
it out now, you will not be
disappointed.
The Kardashians
have a multi-million
dollar empire,
a successful TV
show, and several
influential brands.
So why are they so
resented?

The Kardashian kingdom
T
he Kardashians’
long standing
affair with the
media began in
1994, when Robert
Kardashian Sr. thrust
the family into the limelight
defending his friend O. J.
Simpson. In the following
decades, members of the clan
have appeared sporadically
throughout various
media. Kim Kardashian,
in particular, was always
quick to maximise her media
presence, garnering mild
buzz by positioning herself
as Paris Hilton’s supposed
confidante and stylist. Kim
and the family, however, both
managed to fly relatively
under the radar of the
general public until 2007.
This was when a sex-tape,
featuring Kim and her then-
boyfriend Ray-J, leaked,
thrusting the family into the
limelight. Incredibly, and to
Kris Jenner and Kim’s great
credit, they capitalised on this
new found infamy with the
production of a reality show
based on their lives. Fast
forward to today, Keeping
Up with the Kardashians is a
staple of the TV zeitgeist and
the archetype that springs to
mind when someone mentions
the term ‘reality show’.
Kim’s net-worth alone has

exploded from an estimated
$4.4 million in 2007, to $150
million today. That’s more
than Kanye, Drake, and Miley
Cyrus. There’s a reason Kim
takes the lead in ‘Kimye’.
So given how successful
the family has been, why is
there so much ill-will directed
towards them, and why do
sentiments still pervade that
they don’t deserve it, or
‘aren’t intelligent enough’
to have earned it?
Some people may suggest
that they’re vapid or shallow
but is this really such a big
issue? Sure, they can be
narcissistic at times, but that’s
something we’re all guilty
of. They are reflections of
ourselves, our obsessions with
social media and trivialities.
Surely we can’t hate them for
being extrapolations of us.
Even then, their perceived
shallowness never manifests
itself aggressively, or with
great ignorance. The family
and series has even made
efforts to highlight the
Armenian genocide.
Instead, perhaps, an
alternative criticism that can
be proposed is that they
don’t really ‘do’ anything.
They simply exist as a family,
and they get paid for it.
Of course, this is probably
the easiest one to debunk.
You don’t make that much
money without being a
shrewd businessperson.
Looking around, it quickly
becomes apparent just
how many different pies
the Kardashians have their
fingers in. There are two
different apps dedicated to
just Kim, God knows how
many perfume and fashion
lines, and even a colouring
book. All that probably takes
a lot of work. 		
One could rightly take issue
with their confused stance on
body image positivity. While
they certainly promote a
wide range of body shapes,
it could be argued this is
somewhat inauthentic, given
their reliance on cosmetic
surgeries. Although the
show does occasionally and
superficially touch on issues
on insecurities, it is usually
in a very cursory manor.
The show is also, largely
speaking, empty and
possessing of little intellectual
value, but it still provides
entertainment. It’s something
to have on in the background,
or if you want to just be
entertained without thinking
too much. The often dry and
deadpan delivery of the
‘actors’ coupled with the often
ridiculous situations they find
themselves in makes for great
comedy. In addition, anytime
Kanye appears on the show
is a treat, since his complete
unwillingness to cooperate
with the tone of the show,
and his frequent incredulity at
Kim’s excesses make for good
TV.
At the end of the day, the
show isn’t particularly rev-
olutionary or insightful, but
it doesn’t really need to be.
It does its job, as is clearly
evidenced by its continuing
ratings success. There’s much
to be said for the shrewdness
and capability of the titular
cast, and certainly a few
valid criticisms to be made.
All things considered though,
maybe it’s time to set aside
some of the Kardashian
hate. They don’t need our
validation, which is why they
deserve our respect. Renaissance chic \\ E!
