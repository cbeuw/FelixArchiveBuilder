Decolonising
my mind,
decolonising
my life
\\ How can I continue
living with my mind
colonised and poisoned
by the evil West? \\
Jian Chew goes to great efforts to free
himself from Western colonisation
\\ I left the police
station after telling
them that since I
decolonised my life,
British law no longer
applies to me \\ horrified that Western

I demanded that the medical
staff apologise for imposing
their view of medicine on me
without my consultation. The
nurse then screamed at me
that they saved my life, but I
replied that she offended me,
and she left in a huff without
apologising. The cheek!
When I recovered, I
discovered that I was living in
the United Kingdom, the land
of the world’s ultimate colonial
power! I decided to return to
Malaysia, but realised again
that it used to be a British
colony! Horror! I had to go
to Guangdong, China and
find the village from which
my ancestors left China
L
ast Tuesday I watched
a viral video showing
Social Justice Warriors
(SJWs) at the University
of Cape Town, South
Africa, decrying
science as racist because it
was developed by European
scientists and isn’t applicable
to Africa. Also, magic is real
and science cannot explain
how witch doctors can call
down lightning bolts from
the sky. When one scientist
in the audience said that it
wasn’t true, the SJWs berated
and scolded him until he
apologised. They ended by
saying that people should
decolonise their minds and
reject Western modernity.
I stopped going to lectures
and made it my life mission to
decolonise the world around
me. #endwesternhegemony.
I was dressing when I
realised that T-shirts and jeans
are American inventions.
How dare the Americans
colonise my clothes? In
disgust, I took them off. I also
took off my Uniqlo Heattech
inner clothing. How dare
the Japanese colonise my
clothing after losing WW2?
#endjapaneseinfluence. I kept
my underwear though, since
underwear was invented in
China amongst other places.
I realised that electricity was
a Western concept since it
was discovered by Benjamin
Franklin and generated by
Nikola Tesla and Thomas
Edison. I turned off all the
electrical appliances and
huddled underneath a blanket,
annoying my flatmates. When
they complained about the
cold, I bought a sack of coal
to burn for warmth and they
promptly threw me out of the
flat.
I first went to the Chemistry
department at Imperial and
loudly demanded that they
stop teaching it since the basis
of Chemistry was discovered
and advanced by the Arabs.
Alas, their colonised minds
couldn’t take the truth and the
security guard evicted me. I
then went to the Mathematics
department and screamed
that Arabic numerals were
invented by the Indians and
that geometry was discovered
by the Greeks, and the English
should decolonise themselves
and revert to using whatever
number system the Celts had.
This time the police arrested
me for being a public nuisance.
appropriate our food?
#endfoodappropriation. I was
soon beaten up by a mob of
angry people.
At this point you must be
wondering what I’m doing
with my life. That’s a very
good question. However, if
you think or say anything
negative you have offended
me and my safe space and I
demand an apology or I will
dishonour you and your cow.
I woke up in hospital,
I left the police station
after telling them that since
I decolonised my life, British
Law no longer applies to me. I
spoke to them in Chinese since
I had decolonised my speech.
Their minds opened by
my revelations (or maybe
because they were fed up
with me), they let me go. I then
went on a campaign telling
people to stop using paper
money, paper, gunpowder
and the compass as they are
Chinese inventions, as well
as to stop eating pasta. How
dare the Italians culturally
I was astonished! These
SJWs have opened my mind!
How can I continue living
with my mind colonised and
poisoned by the evil West? I
spat out my morning oatmeal
in disgust. How can I eat
this patently Scottish dish?
#firststepindecolonisation.
I then realised that I
study at Imperial College
London. Imperial!
#educationcolonisation.
five generations ago. I then
realised that even the Chinese
I spoke was due to imposition
of Mandarin by the northern
elite to standardise the Chinese
language, and unfortunately
I speak no Hakka, my
native dialect! See how they
erode our unique identity?
#endnorthernhegemony.
#longlivesouthchina.
That left the problem of
how to go there. I couldn’t
take automobiles, trains or
aeroplanes. But I had one
final realisation. The SJWs in
the video said that gravity was
a Western construct.
I finally realised that gravity
was a Western conspiracy to
hide the ancient golden age
of humanity where people
flew everywhere! After I type
this article I shall reject the
concept of gravity and fly to
my destination, where I shall
be a farmer. Without any land
and knowing squat about
farming, I shall subsequently
starve to death, but hey, at
least I will have completely
decolonised my mind and life.
I shall be truly free. And dead.
