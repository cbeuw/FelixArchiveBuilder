SEX
surrounding consent when
you’re drinking, and there’s
a huge stigma associated
with asserting this after the
fact. It’s clear to me now that
active participation does not
equal consent, and I know
now that something was
different from the moment I
woke up.
I don’t think that any of
my friends thought that I
deserved to be raped, that by
being too drunk or generally
promiscuous I was asking
for it. They just didn’t believe
that I hadn’t given consent.
The grey area that surrounds
exactly when someone can
give informed consent is diffi-
cult to navigate, and crossing
that line can be easier than
you’d think. There are so
many people who have been
in a situation where they
felt uncomfortable about
something that happened,
grey area that they’re damag-
ing and traumatising.
For me, it was difficult to
come to terms with how much
it had upset me. How can you
be traumatised by something
that you can’t remember, or
something that maybe wasn’t
even unpleasant at the time?
There wasn’t anything to have
flashbacks about, just an
intense feeling of unease and
unfocused anxiety.
It took a long time, a lot
of evidence, and an astute
interpretation of an offhand
comment I made to a sexual
health doctor to make me
realise that I did have a
right and a reason to feel
distressed, and to release
some of the guilt that I’d been
feeling.
I like to think that now I’m
okay. I no longer freak out
when I see him on Facebook,
and I could probably interact
through the college on
every level. Every day in my
academic career, I am forced
to fight and defend myself
as equally competent as my
male counterparts. Imperial
strives to achieve equality for
all genders, and for the most
part, things are improving.
But it is horrifying to find
people in this environment
who feel that it is my fault that
someone chooses to have sex
with me without my consent,
because I made the decision
to drink too much at a party.
It is appalling that there are
people here that think that
I no longer have ownership
of my body if I have slept
with more than n people in
the past. At Imperial, the
sexism that I face every day
manifests itself in a rape-and-
control culture that is subtle
and pervasive.
I didn’t expect to be in the
situation where my friends
were slut-shaming me after
being sexually assaulted. I
thought that these were lib-
eral, good people, who were
two and a half years in prison
following his conviction in
2012. For victims of sexual
assault and rape, it is very
difficult to report the crime,
and this is reflected in the
numbers of unreported cases.
For the accused, it can be
incredibly damaging, as this
is one of the few parts of the
law where guilt is assumed
over innocence, regardless
of the outcome of the trial.
Although I feel strongly that
having had his conviction
overturned, he should now
be treated as innocent, I was
horrified to read about the
line of questioning that the
victim (who made the accu-
sation) was forced to endure.
She was subjected to an
examination of her sexual his-
tory, with her previous sexual
partners giving evidence as to
whether they thought that this
particular sexual encounter
the words of Donald Trump,
“grab her by the pussy”, and
control her however they
want.
It’s funny when you know
the person who assaulted
you so well, when their lives
are so intertwined with yours;
extracting yourself from this
tangle is complicated and
traumatic. After enduring
months of having panic
attacks whenever I could not
avoid returning home, I man-
aged to move out. Filtering
out my cutlery, books, and
games consoles from his room
was painful, and the stupor
that I was in while packing
cost me a lot of my stuff, that I
was long resigned to losing.
To get my coat back feels
like it’s come full circle. Along
with the coat comes a rush
of memories and emotions
surrounding how I lost it. I
don’t think that I’m the same
with him face to face without
having to take the next day
off to lie in a dark room. I
struggle to remain friends
with people who still see me
as simply regretting having
sex with him, who have told
me to stop making excuses
for my decisions, and who
continue to reference it. I’m
no longer friends with my
other housemate, who it turns
out questioned my ability to
consent at the time, but didn’t
think to intervene.
The repeated surveys and
campaigns that take place at
Imperial reveal an under-
current of sexism running
aware of the subtleties of
consent. Imperial being Impe-
rial, I think that in general we
experience less widespread
lad culture than the average
university. But what I learnt
from this is that misogynistic
lad and rape culture is deeply
ingrained in everyone, even
here, and we need to actively
try to correct it. Having a
peripheral awareness of the
existence of rape culture, and
acknowledging that it is a bad
thing is simply not enough.
In a recent retrial, footballer
Ched Evans was found not
guilty of raping a girl in a sim-
ilar situation, after spending
was something that she would
have enjoyed and wanted.
This questioning sets a
dangerous precedent, as it is
horrendously discouraging
to victims of sexual assault to
know that they may have to
tolerate public questioning of
this level in order to enforce
the law. I know that my pre-
vious sexual behaviour does
not contribute to whether or
not I am giving consent in
situations like this, and that
allowing the consideration
that it might merely serve
to perpetrate the idea that
if a woman is promiscuous,
anyone has a right to, in
but never acknowledged that
they could be faultless.
Consent classes are being
held all over the country to
try and tackle the vast gap
between what films and
television, pornography, and
‘lad culture’ tell us is a normal
sexual encounter, and what
actually constitutes informed
consent. This isn’t to dampen
anyone’s fun – you can have
sex when you have been
drinking – but we all need
to reconsider whether what
we often think of as casual
drunken flings are making us
and our partners feel good,
or if they’re so far into the

person who lost this coat,
who felt safe enough among
friends to get that drunk. To
be assaulted cost me friends,
possessions, and eventually
contributed to the end of my
relationship, and these con-
sequences are not something
that I can easily forget. But
after I get it very thoroughly
cleaned, I’ll put the coat back
on, and each day I wear it
I’ll remember, and every time
I remember it will get a bit
easier. After losing so much,
to get something back feels
like I’m finally taking back
control.
Drunk consent is not consent. My rape story
T
his week the coat
I lost on the night I
was raped found its
way back to me.
Having lan-
guished, dirty and
unloved, at the back of a
cupboard in a house I occa-
sionally visited for parties,
it was unearthed in a start-
of-year clean and returned
to me. I had been there a
year and a half ago for a
club social, where I’d drank
way beyond my limits, and
the night had gone terribly
wrong.
I had amazing friends there
an Uber and taken home.
I’m told it was difficult to
get me in an Uber. At home,
my friend and my housemate
poured me into bed, noting
my badly bruised and bleed-
ing knee as I uncoordinatedly
wriggled into pyjamas. I was
confused, begging for my
boyfriend. One of them made
a joke that he wasn’t there
because he didn’t love me.
I believed him when he said
we’d broken up, and cried.
They later told me that I was
too scared to sleep alone,
and that I insisted that my
other housemate, who had
have consented to it. Extra-re-
lationship sex wasn’t exactly
something that I could claim
to be unfamiliar with, and
despite the unfamiliar gnaw-
ing feeling I had, I trusted that
my housemate had not taken
advantage of me. My casual
approach to sex was always
something that I’d had control
of; when I’d had sex it was
always on my terms. I’d never
regretted or felt ashamed of a
sexual encounter before, and
it was disconcerting to have
to ask a third party what I’d
done, and simply not know
condition in which I would
have consciously agreed to
have sex with someone, much
less someone who I would
have to live with for another
six months, and who I hadn’t
ever actively considered
sleeping with
But, before I fully under-
stood, while I was still
processing my hazy idea of
what had happened, word
spread to our mutual social
circle. On top of having to
patch over the deep wound
that my apparent choos-
ing to have sex with this
just arrived home from a dif-
ferent party, get into bed and
sleep with me so that I didn’t
die in my sleep.
When I woke up in the
morning, naked, with this
housemate in my bed, and
a pool of vomit staining my
sheets, I had to ask my other
housemate what had hap-
pened. We’d had sex, he told
me. He’d heard. Twice.
I don’t remember what
happened. I don’t remember
a lot of the night leading up
to this, and it took months
to piece together what had
happened. Months where I
convinced myself that I must
how I’d felt at the time.
I later found out the extent
of my memory blackout. I’d
been totally out of control. I
had thrown up in at least two
locations, as well as being
vomited on by someone else.
He later told me that I was
awake and actively partici-
pating, and I believe him, but
I like my sexual encounters
with a bit of dignity, and
that does not stretch to
being covered in blood and
vomit. Without the memory
of what happened, I have
the more evidence-based
assertion that this was not a
who offered to take care of
me, but I had drunk so much
that I was out of my comfort
zone, and drunkenly created
a Facebook group chat to
my most spoken-to contacts
(including my mother) beg-
ging someone to come and
pick me up. One friend lived
nearby, and he came and
collected me, and took me to
his flat.
Once I was there, I was
disoriented and scared.
I thought I was at my
boyfriend’s house, and
demanded to know where he
was. I demanded to be put in
particular person gored in my
relationship, I found myself
expected to joke about it
and laugh along. After all, if
you’re someone in an open
relationship who occasionally
has sex with friends, no one
thinks that any sex you could
have with a friend could be
non-consensual, no matter
what state you might have
been in. It seems that most
people really do believe that
if you’re someone who ‘gets
around’ when you drink,
you’re probably always up
for it.
