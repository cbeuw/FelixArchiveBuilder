Fancy a film?
A society made for and by film enthusiasts who meet every Monday and
Thursday in good ‘ol Blackett. A great way to start/end the week; great films
and great discussions. Some very knowledgeable folk in there, so if you’re look-
ing to broaden your film knowledge head over! For just £5 a year, it’s basically
free.

This is THE society to join if you’re interested in filmmaking. This is where you
go to if you are interested in producing short films, documentaries, music videos
or anything else that involves recording things on camera. Catering to all abili-
ties, you should definitely give this a go if you’re even the least bit interested in
creating moving pictures. Also, once you’re a member, you can rent their super
awesome equipment.
A cinema, the outlet for films. Here’s where you can see all the recent blockbusters
for dirt cheap wirth regular viewings on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You can also help
out with running the cinema and getting handsy with the £100k equipment. For the
real film aficionados there’s the all-nighters held once a term where for one night you
can watch six films back to back from dusk til dawn.

You love films so much you want to tell everyone about how awesome films
are? Welcome to FELIX Film. Part of the culture section in FELIX, anyone can
submit film related articles, reviews or just rants. If interested email film.felix@
imperial.ac.uk.
So you really love film but you don’t know what to do with this love? Set it free on
Imperial campus where there’s lots of film love all around. You can try your hand at
being the next Tarantino, talk to likeminded people about how much you love that
one plot twist from that film, or maybe you just want to tell EVERYONE about said
plot twist. Watching films, making films, discussing films.
Imperial’s got you covered.
