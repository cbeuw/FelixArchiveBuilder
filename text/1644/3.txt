Does anyone still care about Union Council?
I bet you won’t even read this, you undemocratic filth
Lef Apostolakis
T
he first Council
meeting of the
year took place
last Tuesday and
Nas Andriopoulos,
Union President
failed to present a written
report, in violation of his
constitutional obligations.
Council is the representative
voice of the student body and
part of this includes holding
the sabbatical officers to
account. As such, Council
requires they produce reports
on what they’ve been up to.
After apologising and
reassuring council of his
commitment to prevent this
from happening again in the
future, he presented verbally.
“It’s regrettable that I was
unable to present a written
report at the Council meeting
this week,” he later told
felix. “Rest assured this is a
one-off occurrence and I will
guarantee that a full written
report will be presented at the
next meeting in two weeks’
time.”
The absence of a written
report didn’t go unnoticed
amongst the other members
either, with one anonymous
Council member saying “the
whole concept of a council
report is that you are elected
as a student and throughout
your time as an elected
official you are accountable
to them. Part of that is telling
them what you’re doing. If
you’re not writing a report
you have closed all channels
of communication and you
might as well be a member of
staff. That’s the whole point
of having elected sabbatical
complications with the room
booking, and there was no
confirmation of whether
there’d be a Union staff
member to take minutes until
the very last minute.
In fact this is actually the
second scheduled Council
meeting of the year, but the
first one to be realised, as
an earlier meeting had to
be cancelled due to lack of
organisation (in particular
issues with room booking).
Council Chair, Abigail de
Bruin, had wanted to start
off the year by providing
training for Council members
and inherent within that was
the assumption of having
the Governance Manager’s
support. But the Union role
was made redundant earlier
this July so Council members
were only sent a powerpoint
instead. “I didn’t think I had
the authority to summon 16
people to listen to me talk,
whereas if there is a staff
member there’s an element of
validation to it”, says de Bruin.
The removal of the role
and the perceived failure to
reallocate most of the duties
that came with the position has
made many students unhappy.
The role of Governance
\\ No one really
cares what happens
there. Just let the
students be angry
somewhere \\ Manager encompassed things
such as organising minutes
and agendas for all the major
meetings in the Union, being
the deputy returning officer
for the Big Elections, as well
as being an integral part of
the Governance Committee,
among other things.
This has led some to believe
that the removal of the
Governance Manager role
is a symptom of a general
disregard for democratic
processes. As de Bruin
explains, “There’s been
a fundamental issue that
I’ve definitely felt since I’ve
started. Because attendance
was repeatedly poor last year,
Union Council, despite being
our greatest democratic tool,
has been really disregarded.
It’s thought of as this thing like
‘It happens but noone really
cares what happens there.
Just let the students be angry
somewhere.’”
She concludes, “It’s just
the same issue we’ve faced
in the Union for years:
Communication with the
membership.”
Just look at how ‘packed’ it once was (c.2013) \\ Cem Hurrell
officers. If you need to cut
corners, that’s just not the one
to cut”.
This hasn’t been the only
hiccup Council faced so far,
indeed Council has had a
turbulent start. Many of the
officers expected to produce
a report (including yours
truly) were unaware of their
obligations, which included
presenting a report of their
progress, until Thursday
last week. There were also
