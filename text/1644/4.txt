Harambe vigil in Hyde Park
Imperial computing student organises memorial
Cale Tilford
U
p to 3000 are
expected to
attend a candle-
lit vigil this Friday
in Hyde Park to
commemorate
the life and death of Harambe,
the Gorilla killed earlier this
year at the Cincinnati Zoo and
Botanical Garden in Ohio.
The event, which was set
up by third year Computing
student Paul Balaji in response
to a similar event in Durham,
has already engaged with
over 14000 people including
5700 people who have shown
interest.
The vigil marks the five
month anniversary of the
death of Harambe, a Western
lowland gorilla who rose
to prominence in May after
being shot when a three-
year-old boy climbed into
his zoo enclosure. Harambe
has become the subject of
various internet memes since
his controversial death,
including the popular ‘Dicks
out for Harambe’. Many have
noted the surprising longevity
the meme, which has been
attributed to the reluctance
of corporations to co-opt
his image as part of their
marketing campaigns.
Speaking to felix, Paul
Balaji described his initial
expectations for the event:
“It was literally just a bit of
banter, maybe I could invite
a couple of hundred friends,
20 show up and we can chill
in Hyde Park for a bit and
then head to the Union or go
out somewhere.” Despite the
popularity of the candlelight
vigil on Facebook, it’s possible
that the event could run into
trouble with park authorities;
Royal Parks policy requires
that any gathering over 40
people must contact the park
office. However, Paul was
\\ It was literally

more optimistic: “The event
is so big people are actually
questioning whether it’s
gonna happen or not – it will
happen. At the end of the day,
if people turn up with candles,
be respectful to Harambe and
don’t act like idiots - I think it’ll
be a fun little meet up.”
Union launches social enterprise scheme
You can make bags of cash and be a good person Lef Apostolakis

mperial College Union
launched its new social
entrepreneurship scheme,
ACT Now! (exclamation
mark and everything)
last Monday, at an event
that saw seasoned as well as
novice entrepreneurs, take
to the stage and share their
experiences in the Union
Concert Hall.
Nas Andriopoulos, Union
President, started the event
with a warm welcome in
which he outlined the aims of
the ACT Now! scheme which
include creating “the hub
for all enterprise activity at
recent endeavour to create
a company aimed at fast
tracking medical examinations
through the drone facilitated
transportation of samples.
The team talked about the
hurdles they had to overcome
and the difficulty of trying to
run a business during their
degrees, but ended on a high
note, encouraging aspiring
entrepreneurs to believe in
their ideas.
Ilana Taub runs a viable
company which consciously
manufactures snacks in an
effort to reduce global food
waste. Like Dell and Debesh,
Taub talked about the
inspiration behind her business
as well the challenges she has
had had to overcome, some of
which she’s still facing. These
included financial viability
of the product as well as the
ethical complications that
arise when trying to create a
socially conscious business.
Despite the quality of the
presentations, the event left a
bitter aftertaste and some of
us wondering whether social
work and entrepreneurship
should ever be marketed as a
pair.
Imperial”. The scheme involves
a series of workshops, pitches,
and sessions with people
within the Union to help
further social enterprise ideas
you might have.
The first speaker to be invited
on stage was Paul Barlow
from Creative Conscience,
a company which tries to
connect “young designers
with a problem and [unite]
them to change the world”.
The Unilever-sponsored not-
for-profit holds annual awards
for “socially valuable, human
centered design”, the winners
of which get “mentorship or
internships (through the CCA
network) and profile building
PR activities”. Sadly the prizes
made the awards feel more
like a way for companies to
poach talented, driven and
socially conscious individuals,
rather than promote social
entrepreneurship.
Talks from a number of recent
entrepreneurs followed,
including Tristan Dell &
Debesh Mandal from IRIS
Drone Technologies, current
IC undergrads, and Ilana
Taub from Snact who eagerly
shared their experience.
The former talked about their

consists solely of GradPad.
There is a Union Council paper
that handily sums up the issue:
“The basic PhD stipend is less
than a years rent at GradPad”.
It also appears Postgraduates
will remain unable to use
College as a guarantor until
three years of international
undergraduate students have
been trialled successfully.
T
he skyrocketing
price of student
accommodationhas
been an ongoing
issue in the minds of
students, one that
certainly feels all too familiar
for Imperial students living in
London. This week saw the
publication Property Week
being forced to withdraw a
category from their Student
Accommodation Awards after
the panel of student judges
refused to choose a winner
for Student Experience in a
protest over increasing rent
prices.
The panel consisted of
students from a broad range
of institutions including UCL,
Bristol and Manchester
Metropolitan University. In
an open letter tweeted by
Jenny Killin, welfare officer at
the University of Aberdeen’s
Student Association, the panel
explains the decision they
took: “None of the entrants
could demonstrate that
they are meeting the urgent
need of students to live in
accommodation that will not
force them into poverty”.
Thestudents’openlettergoes
much further into explaining
quite how dire the current
situation is, stating that one
applicant “puts shareholder
satisfaction before student
satisfaction and boasts “£20
million revenues” and ends
resoundingly in the statement
“Unless all students have
access to safe, affordable
accommodation at every
institution and the means to
pay for it, there is no cause for
celebration, nor the ability for
us to award a for-profit sector
for failing so many of our
peers.”
The decision by the student
judges has been treated
respectfully by Property
Week, with a spokesperson for
the Student Accommodation
Awards saying in a statement
to The Guardian: “Our student
judges have sent a clear
message that the industry
needs to do better. In light of
this,wehavetakenthedecision
to remove this category for
this, our inaugural event, and
review it for 2017. We will
continue to encourage the
industry to raise its game and
put the student experience
at the centre of everything it
does.”
It is a hollow comfort to hear
how universal the situation
is across other institutions.
This is an issue that has been
discussed frequently over
the last few years at Imperial
College Union, featuring
heavily in many DP (Welfare)
manifestos. Last year saw
Jennie Watson’s proposal
for College to act as a rent
guarantor for overseas
students being accepted and
agreed by the Provost, a clear
win. That said, there is clearly
a lot further for College to go
when it comes to affordable
student accommodation.
The primary target for
further action here surely
has to be for postgraduate
students, whose current
accommodation offering as

Cellebrate women’s sport by “jumping away the calories” Lef Apostolakis
C
ontinuing on from
the successful
This Girl Can
campaign, Sport
England have
joined forces with
BUCS to promote female sport
participation at universities
nationwide between 31
October and 6 November.
This means the Union is
launching Imperial Girls Can
again this year in an attempt
“to encourage and celebrate
womens sport”.
The initiative sees twelve
events at various locations
on and off campus (but
predominantly at Ethos),
places on which can be
reserved for free by quoting
IC Girls Can.
Interestingly, half of the
events are dance or aerobics
classes, two are lectures
including a lecture on healthy
eating, and one is the ACC
Sports night. Here is the
description for Kanggo Jump
Class: “Get bouncing in this
unique aerobics class. With

long socks”. Admittedly, trying
to promote women’s sports by
making it all about the calories
is questionable at best.
In fact, only two events offer
the opportunity to participate
in a team sport.
We approached women’s
rugby for comment. “Sport
Imperial did not involve us
at all in the planning of their
rugby event, the tag rugby
session, evident by the fact
that it is at 1pm on a Monday.
They did ask us if we’re going
to do anything extra, which
we are, but haven’t advertised
it at all”, said Vivien Hadlow.
At the end of the day, it
seems that although there is
a attempt to subvert sexist
stereotypes and encourage
women to participate in sport,
the effort falls short.
