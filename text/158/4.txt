T h e Rector's C u p
The annual inter-collegiate boxing
competition was held in the Concert Hall
on Friday, February 3rd,
Entries were in the usual number, and
of higher than usual standard. After
eighteen bouts Guilds won through with
60 points, against 28 from Mines and 15
from R.C.S.
There was the usual lack of competit-
ion in the lower weights, but no unearned
advantage was gained as the fly, bantam
and featherweight divisions were won on
walkovers by R.C.S., R.S.M., and C.&O,
respectively.
The best boxer of the evening was
judged to be J. White (O.&G.) who won
the heavyweight division. His bout with
J Fairfield (R.S.M.) was a fine display,
for which Fairfield was awarded the best
losers cup. This cup was generously pre-
sented by C.C. Seaford Esq., President
of the Boxing Club.
Another good display was that of G.
Mackie (O.&G.) who won through two
very hard bouts before announcing a truce
with the other ligh-welter finalist, another
Guildsman.
The bout between P. Mousses-Jones
(R.S'.M.) and the physically formidable
A. Butler ( C. & G. ) was convincingly
finished bv the polished left hook of the
Miner in the first round. Those who saw
Butler's punching power demonstrated in
his previous bout could hardly have ex-
pected this result.
The M.C. for the evening was Mr. Brian
Shaw, Captain of the U.L. Boxing Club.
He had a hard time making himself heard
over the riotous applause and encourage-
ment, but no harder a job than that of
the seconds and L.A.B.A. officials. The
thanks of the C!ub are due to these
gentlemen, and to all those- who helped
with the organisation, particularly J.
Henry Esq., Vice-President of I.C.Bx.C.
i t .CROSS COUNTRY
First report is the result of the Q.M.C.
invitation 7Â£ mile race. In this the I.C.
team was much weakened by injury and
two members John Collins and Dave
Hammonds were out representing their
counties in the Intercounties match at
Bihgley. However, this weakened sido
did very well to finish seventh behind
teams like Oxford and Cambridge and it
was awarded the John Banks Trophy for
being the first London team home.
On Wed. 1st Feb. in what should have
been a second team match we completely
swamped teams from L.S.E. and Charing
Cross and Westminster Hospitals having
the first four out of our six in the first
seven.
Result:
I.C. 16
L.S.E. 43
Charing Cross and Westminster 5

The U.C. invitation race on the follow-
ing Saturday was the scene of I.C. I's big-
gest success so far this season. In a field of
20 I.C. was placed second to Cambridge,
beating Oxford, Bristol, all the London
College teams and many others. Mainlv
resposible for this fine result were J.
Collins (4), J. Cleator (5), T. Wilkins
(10), and a fast improving runner J.
Greenleaf (22). The second team also ran
very well and beat all the other second
teams in the field'. ,
On the following' Wednesday the first
team travelled to Reading for an annual
triangular match aginst the University and
the R.A.M. Sandhurst. Over a very un-
usual course which included a wide canal
waist deep with muddy water we were
closely beaten into third place.
Result:
Reading 52
R.A.M. 59
I.C. 60
jOn the same day the third team was
participating in the last match in their
division of the University League. With
a very small team, I.C. finished a cred-
itable 5th out 10 teams and ended 4th
in the overall league placings. Final
League II placings:
1. Barts. 412
2. Battersea 357
3. Guys 325
4. I.C. Ill 323
5. N.C.L. 294
6. Goldsmiths 236
7. U.C. II 208
8. L.S.E, II 103
9. Q.M.C. II 93
10. Westminster 44
This Saturday (11th Feb.) over our
home course at Petersham, we were hosts
to Vale of Aylesbury A.C. and Lloyds
Bank A.C. With our three best men run-
ning for the University in the National
Universities Championships we did well
to beat a strong Lloyds Bank team, but
we could not match the Vale's team which
had first four men home.
Result:
Vale of Aylesbury 32
I.C. 43
Lloyds Bank 52

I.C. CONCERT HALL.
RUGBY
On February 1st the table tennis room
was packed full with spectators to witness
one of the semifinals of the Carribean Cup
between I.C. I and Woolwich I. Tension
in the room was high as the vital match
between our number one, C.C. Chow and
their number one S. Kalinka, was started.
Chow was off to a bad start and was
soon several points behind, but by some
very strong and consistent attacking he
slowly but surely recovered and went on
to win this match to put I.C, one up. In-
spired, perhaps, by this opening win, our
team couldn't go wrong, and the final re-
sult was a win for Imperial College by
five games to one. The final will be played"
at U.L.U. against Kings where all sup-
porters will be welcome.
The first team completed their league
fixtures with a convincing 8-2 win
against R.D.H. I and although they have
undoubtedly won promotion back to div-
The Gutteridge Cup Semi-Final be-
tween I.C. and Q.M.C. was played on
Wednesday, February 8th, and resulted in
a narrow (and somewhat lucky) win for
I.C. by a try and a penalty goal to a try
I.C. had (on paper at least) a massive
and overhelming advantage which they
did not use to full effect. It seems a pity,
for they should be able to paralyse any
college pack with such seasoned veterans
as Bridges and Bregazzi and an 'emberasse
de richesse' in the front row (especially
now that Howell has returned after hook-
ing for Bridgend during most of the
season).
The forwards follow up well, pack well
both in the loose and the tight, and defend
well, but when the ball moves across the
field, they don't seem to be able to look
for it, follow it and heel it,
After all that criticism, let's return to
the game. I.C. started off by throwing
the ball about, but the Q.M.C. pack were
content to be pushed about, broke quicklv
and I.C. centres often died with the ball.
Seed and McCromack were forced to kick
and mightily they did, McCromock's heftv
punts often gained 60 yards or so of
ground, and Seed kicked over his shoulder
time and time again to drive Q.M.C. back
down to their 25.
After ten minutes there was a loose maul
just outside the I.C. 25, and someone
picked the ball out of it. A penalty was
given and luckily, for it was kickable, the
Q.M.C. boot topped it.
In trying to prevent the try, Margretts
the I.C. captain was concussed and had
to go on the wing. At intervals he stag-
gered off to be sponged down by 'Doc'
Sparkes, the Club President.
Just before half time, Bragazzi split a
finger, not long after missing a difficult
penalty, and played the rest of the game
with his hand bandaged.
3-0 down at half time, being beaten at
the back of the scrum, and the outlook not
good at all. Come on I.C. was the cry as
the game restarted.
Cut and thrust up front, with the I.C.
pack trying to grind Q.M.C. into the mud,
was now the order of the day, and a push-
over try was narrowly averted by Q.M.C.
collapsing the scrum. An infringement
gave I.C. a penalty from which Bregazzi
scored to level the scores. Still Q.M.C.
did not give up, and another try was nar-
rowly averted by Millard's running half
the length of the field to drop on the ball
for a twenty-five.
At last I.C. scored, Seed charging
around the scrum and going over. And
that was it.
I.C. could have been 11 points down at
half time if Q.M.C. had had a kicker,
and they must improve for the final, which
for the umpteenth time is agaist Kings.
/On Saturday I.C. had their best day
ever. 8 wins, 1 lost, which was the first
team, 8-6 down to O.M.T.'s Ex. 1st.
Highlights of the day were the President's
try, and the despondency of the Welsh-
men in the bath at Harlington. The policy
of the lower teams keeping together has
been more than justified in recent weeks.
It all makes for good club spirit
BADMINTON
THE 13 th
HYDE PARK
ROAD RELAY
This Saturday sees the invasion of the
Union by students from all over Great Bri-
tain. A record number of 80 teams are
expected to compete in the largest road
relay race in Europe perhaps the world.
This year the race will run over an
entirely new course, owing to the road
works at Hyde Park Corner and Marble
Arch, . and approximately encircles the
Serpentine. The start will be at the west
end of Rotten Row, in front of the Lido,
at 3 o'clock prompt. Martyn Lucking
has kindly consented to st-art the race.
Martyn was last year's University Athlet-
ics Captain, and represented Great Britaii'
in the Rome Olympics.
The outcome of this year's race is as
open as ever. Durham University will have
to improve on previous performances this
year to retain the SirRoderic IJill Cup.
On current performances. Manchester
University seem to be the favourites,
closely followed by Birmingham Univer-
sity and the Loughborough Colleges. Other
teams that need to be watched are Shef-
field and Imperial. The Imperial College
Union Cup, for the minor colleges, should
go to Borough Road Training College.
London, or possibly Queen's or Selwyn
at Cambridge. Some very fast laps are
expected; Steve James, Tim Briault,
Mike Tribe of Cambridge Colleges, along
with Jack Heywood of Reading, should
all break 14.00 minutes.
Best known runner of all, however, will
be Herb Elliot, who will appear in the
colours of Jesus College, Cambridge.
At time of going to press, The Cross
Country Club were very cagey about the
nome team. It will, I think consist of
John Collins, John Cleator, Ted Wilkins,
George Wenk, and any two from Jim
Bernard, Dave Hammonds, Jeff Green-
leaf and Pete Warren. Irrespective of who
runs, I know they will compete with the
whole of the Union's best wishes, behind
them.
SOCCER
by D. Forster
The mixed team laboured to a 5-4 win
over Q.M.C. only to lose by the same
score to U.C. later. Ample revenge was
gained by the first team, however, with
a 6-3 victory over a U.C. side, which
read like a scratch University team. The
team chose the right day to hit form and
were helped by a lethargic display from
U.C.'s first pair.
It is to be hoped that the team does
not suffer a psychological 'reaction' after
clearing this hurdle because there are
games ahead which will not be easy bv
any means.
ision I it is not yet certain whether they
are top of their league. I.G C
Last Saturday the first and second XIs
were playing in U.L. Cup semi-finals. The
first team, playing on the King's College
ground, beat Battersea 1st by 4-3. With
a high wind and comparatively dry ground,
the conditions were against good football,
but both teams fought hard for a place
on the final. With the wind behind them
in the first half, Battersea took a 3-1 in-
terval lead, but a penalty goal early in
the second half put I.C. back into the
game. Playing more confidently the I.C.
team scored two further goals, and thus
qualified to play King's I, who beat L.S.E.
in the final at Motspur Park.
I.C. 2nd XIs semi-final against Batter-
sea II was also close struggle. This match
was played at Harlington, and T.C. won
by 4-3. Thev will play L.S'.E. n in the
final, who beat King's II in the other
semi-final
In their League matches the 1st XI havp
been playing consistently well, and 5-1 and
7-1 wins against "jBattersaa and L.S.E.
respectively have put them in a strong
position at the top of the Premier Div-
ision.
The 2nd XI. however, have been sound-
Iv beaten twice in League matches just
recently, and like the 3rd XI will have
to fight hard in order to avoid relegation.
4th XI continue to play well, and have
fought their way to the top of their League,
which thev now seem likely to win.
Thp 5th XTs form has been incosistent
recently. Following a heavv 6-1 defeat
by Q.M.C., the defeated Birkheck College
The 6th XT were defeated in their cim
bv U.C. IV (4-2). while the 7th XI have
had a win and a defeat in their last two
matches.
