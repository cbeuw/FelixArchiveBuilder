I FELIX 11 December 1968
When the Architectural Association becomes part of
Imperial College in a few years' time, there will have to be
an Order in Council, i.e. Parliamentary Approval, recon-
stituting the Governing Body of the College in order to
bring in members of the A . A . This presents the best of all
possible opportunities for the student body to gain repre-
sentation on the most important of College Committees.
Why should we have a voice on the Governing Body?
Well, take a look at the recent happenings in Art Colleges
like Guildford and Hornsey. In these places, the admini-
stration has paid scant attention to the views and demands
of their students. The only action that has been taken is
to seemingly double-cross the student. In this College we
are fortunate in having a fairly benevolent Rector who,
while he may not be exactly pro-student, is concerned
about I C s external image and would probably go a long
way to avoiding a situation such as the one that periodically
crops up at L S E . The reconstitution of the Governing
Body would provide an adequate opportunity to sidestep
this danger by making provision for student representation
on the committee. It is also important to realise that such
a danger does exist, even in this most insular and reaction-
ary of colleges. The events at Birmingham University (a sci-
ence biased university) could hardly have been foreseen a
few years ago and the growing awareness of student rights
coupled with external stimuli, like the events at L S E and
Birmingham, could easily create a similar situation here
in the near future.
What can we do to help ourselves to get suvi a voice
in College affairs? The first requisite is, obviously, to
have a strong Student Union, a Union which really does, as
the Blue Book puts it, "safeguard and advance the in-
terests of students at the Imperial College." The Union
must be representative of the students at IC and be able
to act democratically and swiftly in the fields of policy and
decision making. It should be with this thought in mind
that Martin Bland and bis Constitutional Reform Com-
mittee are working. Two things they have in mind are
lowering the quorum for the Union General Meeting and
democratic election of the President by ballot of the whole
Union. There is another proposal before them, one which
could only be included at the expense of having the whole
new constitution rejected. This proposal is the abolition
of the Constituent College Unions.
The fust essential of a strong Union is that people feel
a part of it. The general feeling at the present is that
people belong to R S M U , C & G U , or RCSU, rather than
ICU. This, in many ways, is the wrong attitude to take.
It is Imperial College Union that deals with the important
matters like grants, student housing and union facilities.
Although the constituent college unions do valuable work
in the field of academic affairs and staff-student relations,
these might well be better dealt with by either I C U or
(preferably) by the individual departments concerned. Im-
mense damage is done to I C U by the importance which is
attributed to the three smaller unions. Remember, a
Strong I C U is necessary for adequate participation in Col-
lege and nationals Student affairs. It is about time there
was some reconsideration of the role of the Constituent
Cdlege Unions (and the Constituent Colleges themselves).
The time for this is now, before the Architectural Asso-
ciation comes to add to the confusion.

JUS* Relevance to I.C
Dear Sir,
The N U S conference in
Margate the Saturday be-
fore last was given front
page coverage in both Sen-
net and F E L I X . It was
concerned mainly with beat-
ing off the left-wing chal-
lenge to the authority of the
bureaucracy presented by
the proposed amendment to
the constitution which would
allow political issues to be
:"scussed at N U S confer-
ences. This motion needed
a § majority to be carried
and in fact got 64 per cent
of the vote, just 2.7 per cent
short (from F E L I X figures).
IC Union should be in-
volved in this debate which
so ciearly affects the funda-
mental nature of the only
national student union. To
remain outside is to be im-
potent and ridiculous.
Geoff Martin showed the
invalidity of his own posi-
tion of opposition to the
motion in his speech the day
before. He said " There is
a real possibility that the
frightening 'Powellite hys-
teria ' of the right and the
wild-eyed extremists of the
left are bent on a course
leading to violence."
The N U S is clearly a po-
litical organisation if its
president sees fit to produce
this kind of statement and
IC Union should join the
NUS so that it has a share
in shaping the organisation
that is always taken as pre-
senting the concensus of
opinion among students in
Britain.

Dear Sir,
Communicate, Communi-
cate . . . so the theme goes
in the Union this year. But
the Mock Mock trial de-
monstrated the Union Ex-
ecutive's inability to com-
municate: They failed
abysmally to take advantage
of an excellent novel oppor-
tunity provided by the De-
bate's Committee to present
their views to the ordinary
member of the Union. In-
stead they indulged in an
orgy of " in "-jokes. Now
they have engineered the
council-year rep meeting,

to be held at the same time
as the only Union debate of
the term (mentioned in. all
General Studies program-
mes). In addition, the out-
going Overseas Students'
Comm lee (under SCC) has
decided to ask all overseas
students (only) to vote ^or
the new Committee (under
Welfare) also at the same
time—the Union debate on
Race Relations. If the
Union bureaucrats can't
communicate among them-
selves how do they expect
to do so with the other
members of the Union?
What is the purpose of the
Overseas Students' Commit-
tee anyway? Mini IC Wog
Union (ICWU) or a welfare
committee primarily there to
provide adequate reception
to overseas students? If the
latter, should it not be run
mainly by the host students,
i.e. British students. Who
decided that only overseas
students be allowed to vote
at the new elections? Whose
opinions' were elicited?

Quoracy
Yet once again the Union
Meeting, last week, was
forced to break up because
O N E member of the Union
chose to exercise his "de-
mocratic" right only when it
suited his personal whim.
(Mr. Mackman has been
known to moan several
times last session about poor
attendance at Union Meet-
ings and that people get
discouraged from attending
these meetings because they
do not seem to get some
concrete decisions from
them!) If Mr. Mackman is
against the idea of conduct-
ing Union meetings without
a quorum, then he should
have challenged the quorum
a long time before he actu-
ally did or could it be that
he realised that a large ma-
jority of members present
sympathised with MOR-
A D E and the motion would
have been carried.
V I N O D G A R G A
fICU Floor rep)
Ed : —When asked about
the letter, Bob Mackman
said " I think it an insult to
ICU that a floor rep should
say things like this. The
reason why Union meetings
are unattended is because
motions like the one in ques-
tion are continually brought
up. Floor reps don't just
represent the idiots who go
to Union meetings but 3,500
other students as well."
Changes
Dear Sir,
I was fascinated by Der-
mott Corr's letter in the
latest edition of F E L I X .
Apart from his evasive pro-
nouncements on Morphy
Day, to which RCS has re-
plied appropriately, his cri-
ticism of F E L I X was most
revealing.
When dealing with F E -
LIX'S biased presentation of
facts, he refers solely to in-
accurate implications about
people's drinking capacities.
Is this a positive reflection
of life at ICU? I find it fair.
Personally, I would con-
gratulate Felix for managing
to adopt any attitude, posi-
tive or negative, to the trivial
non-events that pass for
news-items. Of course it
bores everyone stiff, but
what is the alternative?
Sennet faces much the
same problem, but resolves
it by dealing with issues of
national and world-wide im-
portance. Not so in IC!
The outside world is not
visible over the Union Bar.
Within the College, tradition
appears sacred and is served
accordingly . . . or was until
that curious business about
RCS and Morphy Day. This
is only the first rumbling of
change—both in activities
and in attitudes. Then, per-
haps, someone might say or
do something worth print-
ing.

Censure
Dear Sir,
The City and Guilds
Union has requested me to
write to the EDITOR of
F E L I X informing him of
the following motion v/nich
was passed unanimously at
the General Union i.ieeting
on December 3rd.
"City and Guilds Union
condenn the wholly mis-
representative attitude ex-
pressed by F E L I X of both
students and staff at the
demonstration on the 30th
October (i.e. Mornhy Day),
and it also condemns the
grossly inflammatory nature
of the articles.
"Previous weeks' b.'^sed
reporting in F E L I X was fol-
lowed in later issues by in-
citement to violence. F E L I X
has been corrupted and is
now no more than an instru-
ment of militant left-wing
pseudo-intellectualism.
" We condemn this misuse
of Union resources and the
total misrepresentation of
the views of a vast section of
IC Union students and de-
plore (the present Sack cA
editorial policies in F E L I X
and request the existing edi-
torial staff to review the
situation with the object of
ensuring better representa-
tion of IC opinion and more
factual reporting by that
paper in the future.
City and Guilds Union
request the President to
write to F E L I X to inform
them of this motion."
D. F. C O R R
I President, C. & G. College
E D : —Two F E L I X repre-
sentatives attempted to
speak at the Guilds Union
Meeting in question. D, F.
Corr ignored them arid
several others and declared
the motion unanimously
passed. In view of this the
F E L I X editorial staff have
instructed me to brin-* to *,he
notice of all the world a mo-
tion passed at a recent
F E L I X editorial meeting*.
" F E L I X condemns the
childishness of the C & G U
Meeting on December 3rd.
Previous meetings have in-
cluded perverted entertain-
ment and incitement to vio-
lence before the demonstra-
tion of October 30th (i.e.
Morphy Day). C & G U has
been corrupted and is now
no more than an instrument
of incoherent right-wing
pseudo-intellectualism. F E -
L I X condemns this waste of
Union money and suggests
it be put to better use in
financing the nofsery for
married students."
P.S.—Love from Felicity.
