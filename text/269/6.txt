CHRISTMAS
STOCKING-IT-TOYOU
Records to buy your granny for Christmas.
" CBS Rock machine turns
yoa on."
We've mentioned "The
Rock Machine" before;
this is a cheap L P , which at
15/- for 15 tracks is aston-
ishingly good value for
money. The album features
15 different artists and is
obviously intended to whet
your appetite so that you
will rush out and buy their
individual L.P.s. The artists
themselves are a good cross-
section of contemporary
American folk-rock musi-
cians, with Simon & Gar-
funkel, Taj Mahal, Moby
Grape, Leonard Cohen, and
11 others, all good. The
only fault of this record is
that the material is arranged
so as to give continual
changes of pace and mood,
which doesn't for instance
make it a good party record.
This is a minor criticism
however, and fc those with
a leaning towards prophet
Peel, this offers a cheap in-
troduction D musical mind
expansion. Buy it.
Double LPs for your
nearest and dearest (at
£3 15s. they are certainly
the dearest):
1. " The Beatles." Apple
If you haven't heard it I
hope you enjoy life as the
recluse of Amos Grove.
Excellent, but probably a
mistake making it a double
L P ; all the good tracks on
one disc would outsell
S.P.L.H.C.B.
2. "Wheels of Fire."
Cream. Polydor.
This is a double L P , one
record made in the studio
and the other a live record-
ing made at the Fillmore
Stadium, California. This
live performance features
two very long tracks,
" Spoonful," good solos bv
Clapton and 15 minutes of
drum solo from Ginger
Baker. Whether a drum-
mer of Baker's skill warrants
a solo of such length is
doubtful. The studio L P ,
similar to their earlier work,
offers an interesting contrast
to their live performance.
An expensive record, but a
must for all Cream fans and
a very good example of con-
temporary blues-based Bri-
tish pop.
3. Pentangle. "Sweet
Child." Transatlantic
TRA 178
Yet another of the flock
of double LPs being issued
of late is the Pentangle's
" Sweet Child." This, their
eagerly awaited second L P ,
consists of two sides recor-
ded live at the group's con-
cert at the Festival Hall last
June and two sides studio
recorded. The Pentangle
sing and play traditional and
modern folk, jazz and blues
with fantastic originality and
skill in rhythm and timing;
their versatility is certainly
demonstrated on this L P .
The two guitarists, Bert
Jansch and John Renbourn,
stretch from Charlie Min-
gus's " Goodbye Pork-pi
hat" to " Three dances," a
short collectiorr of very tra-
ditional lute ballads. Jacqui
McShee's penetrating voice
can deliver blues such as
"Your money green" and
traditional songs like " But-
ton T o w n " and " S o v a y "
with equal effect. Terry
Cox and Danny Thompson,
two former " session men,"
provide good rhythm backr
ing on bass, drums and oc-
casionally glockenspiel.
The title track "Sweet
child " and " The trees they
do grow high " are the best
songs on this brilliant LP.
4. Rolling Stone*
"Beggar's Banquet"
Rather overshadowed by
the Beatles' LP release, bat
probably typical Stones' ma-
terial, since written by Jag-
ger and Richard.
5. Incredihle String Band
"Wee Tarn ai** the Big
Huge." Elektra
Reviewed in last issue of
FELIX.
6. Jimi Rendrtx
Very eye-catching cover
if you're a " Playboy " fan.
Reported to be Hendrix
served with ultra-electronics.
Single LPs for the re-
respected minority, the des-
titute and the sensible:
1. "Bookends." S & G.
CBS 63101 stereo.
This is not a new LP,
having been released over
four months ago. The justi-
fication for including it here
is that it is probably one of
the most beautiful records
to be issued this year. The
soft and caressing melodies,
with the tender lyrics, partly
explain the record's un-
doubted charm. The songs
do not tell a story, merely
attempt to produce an image
or tie down a line of
thought, giving the record a
timeless quality. To my
mind, the best record of folk
to emerge from America
since Dylan went rock.
2. Jethro TulL " This was."
Island
A modern blues trecord
with some Cream influence.
On the "Island" label, the
record is well produced for
a small company. It be-
comes somewhat tedious un-
less one is an enthusiast.
3. "Jon! Mitchell " Elektra
For modern folk purists,
Joni Mitchell's first LP on
Elektra, wistfully titled
"Joni Mitchell," is an excel-
lent buy. Joni, a slim,
golden - haired Canadian,
sings simple and very pretty
songs accompanying herself
on guitar. The best tracks
on this beautiful LP are
"Marcie" and "So busy
being free."
4. Tom Paxton. " Morning
Again." Elektra.
See last week's review. If
you enjoy Tom Paxton
you'll enjoy this LP.
5. The Family; "Music in
a Doll's House." Reprise
RLP 6312
The Family are one of
the better groups currently
around. They come from
Leicester; the Farinas, two
of whom form the nucleus
of the Family, were a big
name locally some years ago.
As the LP came out a while
ago, I won't go into much
detail. It is good. The
group have an American
flavour about them. John
Whitney, one of the original
Farinas, has leanings to-
wards jazz, and plays clari-
net or sax on stage. There
is also an electric violin in
the lineup. Try and see
them for yourselves.
6. Big Brother and the
Holding Co. " Cheap
Thrills." CBS
A " live on stage " album
features, or more correctly,
is dominated by the in-
credible voice of Janis Jop-
lin. The album is a selection
from two gigs by Big Bro-
ther and the Holding Com-
pany at San Francisco's
Auditorium; on five of the
seven tracks Janis takes the
lead. Her voice, sometimes
soft, mostly raw and wild,
overlays a series of crude
skeletal backings to produce
one of the most exciting
current sounds around.
Raw, violent, harsh, im-
mediate, the whole L.P.
parallels much of present-
day imagery. It's also a

7. &
Hair." RCA-Victor
(RD 795*)
This LP. produced from
the controversial West End
show, exemplifies the excel-
lent musical scoring and
demonstrates its full poten-
tial.
8. Traffic. "Traffic."
Island
A slightly different, more
enjoyable Traffic. The fuzz-
box, etc. appears 10 uavw.
been relegated to the ranks,
producing a good all-round
LP. Some excellent tracks
noticeable among a collec-
tion of good background
music.
There are many more re-
cords worthy of mention but
•pace and time don't permit.
Examples are Fifth Dimen-
sion, Jefferson Airplane,
Arlo Guthrie (begat of
Woodie Guthrie), etc.
Q. " What and where is the
London Film Festival?"
A. The London Film Festi-
val is the " Cannes " of
the U.K. and it is over so
you have missed it—Sir!
Q. " W h y did I not hear
about it?"
A. Because there was no
publicity—Sir!
Q. "Was open to the
Public?"
A. Why of course—but
purely as an exercise in
mailing ticket applica-
tions since, having done
so, the return post would
have informed you that
the N.F.T. was booked
out on all the nights you
requested—Sir!
Q. " Who patronised it
then?"
A. The 1 per cent of the
65,000 members of the
British Film Institute
who were smart enough
to get their application
forms in during the first
week of their three week
priority booking period
—Sir!
London FiIm
Festival
Open
F i l m s
Q. " W h y is the National
Film Theatre chosen
for the screenings?"
A. Because it can only seat
519 people and, there-
fore, almost exactly 100
per cent of any one film's
potential audience miss
it—and we always try to
work in round numbers
you know!
If you are neither slightly
baffled nor mildly amused
by the above you will be one
of those disappointed people
who know, through experi-
ence, the truth of it all. You
will know that you may
never see Pennebaker's clas-
sic " cinema-verite " docu-
ment " Don't look back "—
the film of Dylan's epic '65
British tour. You will mourn
the fact that you will have
to wait till God-knows-when
to see The Rolling Stones,
Battersea Junk yards and
Brutal Black Power through
Jean Luc-Godard's meta-
physical lens in "One plus
one " (you will probably be
dratting having missed the
spectacle of the said direi tor
applying the non-metaphy-
sical fist to his prod :er !)
Neither, as your mandated
reviewer, can I alleviate
your torment since out of a
total of 27 exhibits I could
only get tickets for a paltry
half dozen. Take heart,
however; I have just spo-
ken to a young American
woman who assured me
that, at the word, "go,"
B O T H the above films could
be shown at College to-
morrow—free of charge.
My contact was one of a
group of young people who
operate under the title of
Open Films. They have just
got off the ground by run-
ning an " Open Film Festi-
val " comprising works by
students of film technique
and moving-art forms, plus
films by established direc-
tors like Luc-Godard, Pen-
nebaker and Bertolucci
(whose film " Partner " was
exhibited at the Festival).
This happened concurrently
with the N.F.T. affair, the
films being projected in
several different parts of
London at the same time
with a mobile unit roaming
the streets, parks and
squares with a view to show-
ing the M.G.M., Rank,
A.B.C.-orientated chap that
cinema does not end with
" The Dirty Dozen." There
may have been draughts and
paving stones for air-con-
ditioning and deep-pile but
there were no entrance fees
and the principle was good.
As yet the Open Films
movement is minute com-
pared to the time-honoured
distribution system under
which most of us see what
the film maker has assessed
to be compliant with our
taste—this of course being
moulded continually by the
films we see. Thus for those
unfortunate provincial dwel-
lers who lose the advantages
of places like the "Arts
Lab." or the smaller-group
cinemas (Cameo, Gala)
there appears to be no way
out of the /Vicious circle!
" Open Films " plan exten-
sions through willing student
societies etc., in all parts
of the country. They can
provide a free service be-
cause their material is sup-
plied by organisations like
the National Film Board of
Canada, Granada Ltd. and
The Swedish Film Institute
and through the Avant-
Garde directors like Godard
whose sympathy is spectacu-
larly altruistic.
In short, the movement is
towards the fusing of the
" Cinema d'Auteur " philo-
sophies wherein the stars will
be the Directors and the
actors taken off the street.
To allow Godard the last
word " We have to make
pictures not FOR people
but FROM them . . . We
must go to the factory and
come back with a film."
More on this next term!
