COUNCIL
SPLIT AT
JURGO
This year's first meeting of J U R G O , the Joint Union,
Rectors and Governors Committee, took place on the 2nd
December and found the student ranks in disarray. With
a negative attitude being shown by the Rector and Deans,
Council failed to press home some of the decisions made
at their pre-JURGO meetir j the previous week.
President Rex Lowin re-
quested representation on
three college committees;
the Exploratory Committee,
which considers policy items
prior to discussion by the
Board of Studies, the De-
velopment Committee and
the successor to the Centen-
ary Appeal Fund Commit-
tee. Lord Penney beat
about the bush and said he
would discuss the first two
with the relevant chairmen
and consider the third when
a successor was found.
Rector Rules
From there to the ques-
tion of discipline, where
Council had basically form-
ulated three proposals:
The formation of a central
disciplinary committee, abo-
lition of the idea of double
punishment (e.g. punishment
by college authorities of stu-
dents already convicted in
court) and abolishing the
concept of punishment for
" bringing the name of the
college into disrepute."
Nothing concrete was de-
cided. The rector spun
words and certain council
members failed to uphold
the collective decisions
made by council the week
before. (See "They Tell
Me " for further comment.)
Other matters discussed
by J U R G O included the
general situation regarding
the timetables of lectures
and laboratory sessions for
Wednesday afternoons.
Special reference was made
to the Chemistry depart-
ment which has, in the past,
been notorious in this re-
spect.
The Pro-Rector, Lord
Jackson, reported that Pro-
fessor Ring (Infrared Astro-
nomy) and Professor Cherry
(Telecommunications) were
interested in the conference
on Teaching and Learning
Methods, which would be
held at the end of the Easter
term.
Non—Event
Penney closed the meet-
ing swiftly without asking
for any other business, this
action setting the seal on an
apparent unwillingness by
the administration to listen
to the student points of
view. If the administration
want to " improve the
good name of the college "
as far as the decreasing
number of prospective stu-
dents goes, they should at
least lend a sympathetic ear
to students already here.
JURGO, it seems, is a non-
event. PIERS CORBYN

INCREASE IN NUMBER
OF FRESHERS IN HALL?
A controversial suggestion for a change in the structure
of Halls of Residence at I.C. has recently come to a
head. Proposals to alter the number of freshers in Hall
from the present level of 25 per cent to one of 50 per
cent (425 places) have caused considerable discussion over
the last week or two.
What, after all the fuss, are the facts ?
Last May, Peter_ Mee, referred to the next U . G . M .
Registrar to the College,
suggested the increase, on
behalf of the Admissions
Policy Committee, in the
hope of checking the fall in
applications for I.C. which,
he claims, is greater than for
other Universities, because
of a shortage of residential
places. A s reported else-
where in F E L I X , this was
brought up after an unex-
plained delay of 6 months,
on the part of the College,
at the recent I.C. Union
Meeting. However, amidst
some confusion, no decision
was reached. The final de-
cision on whether to increase
Freshers' places in Hall will
be made by the Student
Residence Committee, on
which only three students
sit. The matter will not be
The Halls Rep. on Council,
" S p i k e " Bantin, has been
collecting opinion from
all quarters to put before
the Residence Committee.
Under this category comes
a motion passed by
R.S.M.U. suggesting an in-
crease to 35 per cent. How-
ever, the Committee has* al-
ready said that 50 per cent
is an impracticable figure,
and the Wardens have stated
that only a small increase
can be tolerated. Mean-
while, the number of
Freshers in the new Student
Houses has been provision-
ally set at one in six. A t the
time of writing, it was hoped
that a final decision would
have been reached yesterday
(see report in FELICITY).
Others matters decided by
the Residents' Committee at
the previous meeting are as
follows: -
Residents in Student
Houses will be pleased to
know that all rents have
been reduced by 10/- per
week as from 1st October
last, and so everyone will be
getting a refund.
Deficit
However, a deficit of
£5,000 on Halls and Student
Houses is expected by 1970,
which will be met by an
increase in rents. One
suggestion is that Halls
should partly finance Stu-
dent Houses in order, to
bring rents more into line
considering the type of ac-
commodation offered.
The camp beds idea for
accommodating overnight
(male) guests in Southside
has been rejected after all
Wardens reported that there
are unused guest rooms at
weekends.
MINES'
BOTTLE
STOLEN
The much revered
"Match Bottle," held by
R.S.M. as winners of the an-
nual rugby match between
themselves and Camborne
School of Mines, was stolen
from its resting place behind
the Union bar last Thurs-
day evening, presumably by
students. Camborne and
R.S.M. officials are shocked
and surprised, as the bottle
is not a mascot and of no
cash value.
At about 9.30 p.m., the
head barman, Gus, turned
round from serving at the
far end of the bar to see four
strangers removing the
trophy. He gave chase,
shouting " Stop thief," but
nobody else lifted a finger or
even lowered a pot to help
him. The raiders ran out to
a getaway car in Prince Con-
sort Road, breaking a glass
door panel in their haste.
Although Gus was delayed
when the thieves jammed
the double door outside the
bar with a large knife, he
was just, in time to take
down the car number.
After a 999 call, two
policemen interviewed Gus
and Mines President Barry
Sullivan in the bar, and an
" a l l cars" alert was put
out. The car was soon
traced to a Hertfordshire
address, but police refuse to
give this address or the cul-
prits' names unless Mines
prosecute. However, this
has been decided against, so
the raiders remain anony-
mous.
