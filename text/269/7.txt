This week as you can see is more the turn of the smaller
clubs. Taking full advantage of their new facilities the
Squash Club are going from strength to strength with a very
active membership.
The girls too, are having a steady season but are still
looking for new recruits now that the initial keenness has
waned a little.
The larger clubs are beginning to feel the strain of
putting out several teams twice a week with injuries posing
many problems. Last week, no less than 7 of 1st X V were
unavailable through injury, most of whom are our more
experienced players.
The 1st X I (Soccer) found themselves without a game on
Saturday as their opposition, a neighbouring London
College, decided that I.C. were just too good and that they
didn't want to be beaten 11-2 again—quite a compliment!
Pride of place must of course go to the Cross Country
Club, who, making full use of their abundant talent had
the U . L . Championships all sewn up despite extremely
trying conditions.
GIRLS'SPORT
- STEADY
This year so far the for-
tunes of I.C.W.S.C. have
not been as good as last
year.
The hockey team has won
several matches but lacks
the overall shooting power
that it had last year. We had
a bye in the 1st round of the
U.L.U. cup and our 2nd
round match was rained off
last Saturday, so we can
boast of no great successes
yet. The newly founded
swimming team has been
unfortunate to have had
counter-attractions on at
both of its matches this term
which have lured its star
members. Given a full
team we could have a mea-
sure of success.
The squash team is still
competing in the men's
league with some success.
Badminton is the game
which seems most geared to
our talents this year and
both the ladies and mixed
teams have a 100 per cent
winning record.
Table tennis has two
teams competing in the
U.L.U. league, which, in
spite of great promise have
no wins under their belts.
Netball and Judo are still
seeking recruits to make
them quorate and in fact
any team captain will be
happy to see a new face.
Keep-fit is held in the gym
every Monday evening and
is followed by badminton
practice. Squash coaching
is held in the Sports Centre
from 2.00 p.m. to 5.00 p.m.
on Wednesday afternoons
and swimming training on
Monday from 6.30 p.m. and
Friday from 6.00 p.m.
FIFTHS HIT 6
GuysII-2, ICV-4
IC's debutante full-back
opened Guys' account after
five minutes when his back
pass left keeper Roswell
stranded. Minutes later I C s
twin-stopper Mountford ran
30 yards to rob Guys'
centre-forward and slip the
ball past the advancing
Roswell to put Guys fur-
ther ahead.
The Fifth's forwards,
however, were more erratic
in their shooting and it was
another half hour before
Gunnell reduced the arrears.
In a thrill-packed second-
half, IC pressed for more
goals. After 65 minutes
Day bobbed up for the
equaliser and our boys went
ecstatic when Gunnell rose
to head home a corner for
the third. Soon after, the
centre-forward completed
his hat trick.
Shortly before the end,
bustling wingman Park was
struck by a Guys defender,
who was sent off for his
pains.

I.C. WIN U.L.
CHAMPIONSHIP
The University of London
Cross-Country Champion-
ships were held last Satur-
day at Parliament Hill Fields
in extremely muddy condi-
tions. After a fast start
Nick Barton and Norman
Morrison of I C settled into
first and second positions,
with St. George's Hospital
and U C runners tucked in
behind them. The remainder
of IC's runners were be-
tween twentieth and thirtieth.
After the first lap of three
miles, Barton and Morrison
were clear leaders and Barry
Dobrowski, Ashley Deans
and Tony Mason were
working their way up the
field endeavouring to break
the St. George's and U C
packs.
Nick Barton was first
home in 29 mins 33 sees;
second was Norman Mor-
rison i
> 30 mins 23 sees.
Next in for I C were Barry
Dobrowski, 11th; Ashley
Deans, 13th, and Tony
Mason 15th. The second
team also finished well up
beating Kings College first
team.
The previous Wednesday
the first team, having their
best season for many years,
increased their lead in the
London League held at
Trent Park. They now have
a lead of 45 points over
Borough Rd. College. The
second team are in sixth
position, just behind L S E
I, and the third team are
eleventh in League II, al-
though they finished seventh
in this race. The main
strength of the IC team this
year is its depth. The se-
cond team are very keen and
provide a hard core of ta-
lented athletes from which
to choose replacements- for
first team injuries.
Next term should see New
Zealand international Barry
Jones recovered from his
heel injury. Having just
missed selection for the
Mexico Olympics, he will be
very keen to show good
form and will make the IC
team a very hard one to
beat
I.C. Extra lsts in action.
VOLLEYBALL CLUB
IN GOOD FORM
London Regional League
this year; unfortunately affi-
liations had to be in before
we returned to college.
Next term we hope to visit
Exeter and Southampton
universities as we did last
year, and on our present
form we stand a good
chance of beating them
both. In the summer term
we shall again be entering
the Annual Simmarian Vol-
leyball Tournament and
hope to do one better than
we did last year and win the
Division Two Cup. We were
runners up last year.
I hope members will con-
tinue to support the club in
what promises to be our
most successful season yet.
A . J. H O W A R D
Captain
The Volleyball club has
had an excellent start to the
season, having narrowly lost
only one match of the five
played so far. Due to in-
creased membership this
year, and sustained support
of the club, we have been
able to field a strong team
resulting in easy wins over
Southgate Technical College,
St. Mary's College (two
teams) and Gunners Volley-
ball Club. The Soviet Em-
bassy has been the only team
to beat us this season. If sup-
port of the club continues
in its present way we hope
to be able to run a second
team next term.
A l l the matches played
have been friendlies as the
club is not a member of the
THREE TRIES
for DEVANEY
Westcambe Park 10 pts. I.C 18 pts.
This was an excellent and well-deserved win by I.C., pro-
viding an encouraging end to this first half of the season.
The game was to have been played at Harlington, butas
many pitches were unfit it was switched to the Park's
ground which was even more unfit!
The Park started very strongly with some dynamic pass-
ing, rucking and running from their forwards. Close to half
time, I.C. found themselves 10 pts to 3 down—two good
goals against a penalty, when the backs received some
really good possesions; on Parks 10 yds line; Keith Devaney
was put away on the right wing, rounding his man, and
scoring an excellent try wide out.
In the second half I.C.'s superior fitness began to tell,
and with their pack getting on top, the backs had a field
day. Keith Devaney scored two more tries following good
3/4 movements, Keith Heaton scored his customary
opportunist try and Dave Bell too ploughed his way over
after good break by scrum half Rend Weisner. Ex B2 John
Smithies and John Ballard kept a firm grip on the centre
although J.B. perhaps needn't have gone as far as knock-
ing himself out in the process.

Squash
Over recent years, the
squash club has been in a
state of decline despite in-
creased numbers. The for-
mation of a London Univer-
sity Squash League last year
changed this and IC now
has a record number of four
teams, each playing at least
20 league matches in the
season.
With the increased pros-
pect of getting into a team,
members have responded
with great enthusiasm and
the club has become one of
the most active sporting
bodies; and the Wednesday
afternoon coaching sessions
have proved quite success-
ful.
This season the fixture list
contains about 110 matches,
about the same as last year,
as against 36 for the previ-
ous year.
A knock-out tournament
will be continued this year
and there are hopes of a big
ladder competition. Also
being arranged are squash
tours of Cambridge and Ox-
ford, taking two teams on
each tour.
With interest running at
its present high level, IC is
well on its way to becoming
the force it once was in Lon-
don University Squash.

Badminton
The first half of this sea-
son has been reasonably
successful for the club. Both
the men's first team and the
mixed team have lost only
one league game each out of
the matches played so far;
the mixed team lost its first
match of the season to U C
5—4; however, hope of win-
ning the league still runs
high.
The only representative
from IC in the recent BUSF
championship held at Crys-
tal Palace was Lynne Bey-
non in Chem I. Lynne
played very well and
reached the quarter-finals
in the Ladies singles, the
semi-finals in the Ladies
Doubles and the last 16 in
the mixed doubles, an
achievement well worth
noting. The mixed team
must draw great inspiration
from her badminton (the
captain anyway).
