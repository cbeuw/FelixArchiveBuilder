I N Q U O R A T E UNION M E E T I N G
Attendance at the last IC Union meeting on Thursday
28th November returned to a more familiar level of about
200, and, as well could have been predicted at the outset,
it was put out of its confused agony when the quorum
was challenged. Four motions were considered, including
a most important one from George Assimakis which was
lost in a cloud of amendments before finally being killed
by Les Ebdon.
But. first things first. The
proposal to accept the stand-
ing orders, copies of which
were circulated among those
present, was accepted nem.
con. after some amend-
ments were accepted, and a
motion calling for suoport
for Iranian students suffering
tinder oppression from the
Persian Government went
unopposed.
Halls
Then, the motion that
produced the great dissen-
tion. George Assimakis
proposed that the percentage
of freshers in Halls of Resi-
dence should remain con-
stant at 25 per cent, con-
trary to the College Admini-
stration's recommendation
to offer half of next year's
applicants a place in Halt
He argued that such an in-
crease would mean very few
2nd and 3rd year students
would be able to get in Hall,
and it was these who formed
the backbone of most so-
cieties and committees. It
would also mean that stu-
dents failing to get a place
in Hall for their first year
would have little chance of
getting in at all.
Speaking against the mo-
tion, Rob Collinge said that
the majority of freshers were
forced to spend their first
year in digs and so had little
chance of playing a very
active part in College affairs.
This was supported by Jon
Shields, who pointed out
that freshers were in he
worst position to go into
digs, and proposed that the
percentage in Hall be taken
to 35 per cent, an amend-
ment which was rejected by
George Assimakis.
Under prompting from
Les Ebdon, however, he was
persuaded to amend the mo-
tion to cover all College
residence, including Student
Houses, and it was immedi-
ately pointed out that, since
the proportion of freshers in
Student Houses was rela-
tively small, as the number
of Houses grew, the percen-
tage of freshers in Hall
would rise. Before the mo-
tion could be amen -d fur-
ther, Les Ebdon rose to
deliver the finishing thrust,
accusing all concerned of
"not doing their homework"
and complaining about the
procedure. He moved the
next business and this was
thankfully carried.
Finally, Piers Corbyn pro-
posed that I.C. should do-
nate £25 to M O R A D E , the
movement to improve the
standard of art education,
and this was opposed by
Rob Collinge, whose main
argument was that if we're
going to give money away,
there must be something
more worthwhile to give it
to.
At this point, Bob Mack-
man, last year's RCS Presi-
dent, decided to challenge
the quorum and with a hun-
dred too few people in the
Concert Hall there was no
alternative but to finish.
NEWSFROMTHE
PROVINCES
I C s mascot Mike, still with us 18 days aftei its recovery,
was paraded round the three constituent college union
meetings on December 3rd. In a break from tradition,
the Mines' Union meeting discussed, for the first time in
living memory, a motion on a subject which is really I C U
business, the percentage of freshers in hall, while R C S
talked about Morphy Day and their internal politics. Guilds
occupied themselves with entertaining the members of their
congregation.
Mines
The motion at Mines re-
commended that 35 per cent
of nest year's freshers
should be given Hall places
and after a lot of discussion
this was passed. This seems
an eminently sensible idea
and a good compromise be-
tween the existing arrange-
ments and the proposals
which have recently been
brought forward by the ad-
ministration to raise the
level to 50 per cent (see
front page article). Also
discussed was the annual
foreign students visit in the
last week of term when 12
or 13 students from Nor-
way, Germany, Jugoslavia
and other places will be
entertained by R.S.M. at
various functions including
the Mines Ball on the last
day of term. On a more
light-hearted note, the mas-
cot bearers were sentenced
to walk placarded and be-
chained along Oxford Street
at the Mines Carol Singing
tomorrow.
R. C S .
Meanwhile, in the Che-
mistry building, R C S were
discussing ways of making
the Morphy Day battle less
dangerous, a motion being
passed dissociating RCSU
from the towpath battle
while still supporting the
boat race. A motion was
passed almost unanimously,
recommending that the post
of R C S U rep. on Council be
automatically filled by the
Academic Affairs Officer;
this will have to be ratified
by a further meeting of
RCSU. Also, RCS decided
that Mines should give 50
pints of blood for the return
of the Davy Lamp.
Guilds
Over in Guilds, a motion
was proposed in, it is hoped,
a light-hearted manner by C.
Parker censuring F E L I X
This was passed " unani-
mously " Although no op-
posing speeches were al-
lowed. The only item of
importance was a letter fro n
the organisers of the Brigr.
ton Veteran Car Rur in-
forming us that Boanerges
would probably not be al-
lowed to take part in the
run next year. This is appar-
ently due to arriving too
early in Brighton this year.
Entries were invited from
departments for the Festival
for Music and Culture, to
be held at Guilds' next
meeting.
TOUCHSTONE
About twenty people spent
the weekend 30th Novem-
ber/ 1st December discussing
the Society amid the
peace and tranquillity of
Silwood Park. The Speaker
was Dr. Jonathan Gould, a
consultant psychiatrist for-
merly of St. Bartholomew's
Hospital, making his second
visit to Touchstone, who be-
gan bv defining the words
"degenerate" and "society,"
hence coming to a conclu-
sion on the definition of the
" degenerate society."
Crime — even excluding
motoring offenses—had in-
creased three times over the
iast twenty years and this
rise showed no signs of
levelling off. Similar in-
creases in the divorce rate
and the number of heroin
addicts apparently showed
other signs of degeneracy in
our society. However, Dr.
Gould made it clear, with
the aid of statistical evi-
dence, that this degeneracy
only affected a very small
percentage of the popula-
tion.
The rest of the weekend,
apart from Sunday morning
(spent in reading the papers
and walking for miles across
Windsor Great Park), was
taken up in discussing the
questions raised in the
speech.
Although it was unde-
eided whether degeneracy in
society really mattered or
not, it was generally agreed
that a fully permissive so-
ciety, where all crime, im-
morality, etc. was tolerated,
would be both imoractical
and undesirable. However,
no ideas were put forward
as to how to stop society de-
generating and the discus-
sion finally degenerated
when we went and had tea.
Incidentally, Touchstones
are worth 15/- even if-you
only go for the much-better-
than-Mooney meals!
ELECTRONIC MUSIC
"Consider weighted para-
metric simultaneities be-
tween channels to be a func-
tion of poetic accent."
Rather confusing, as is
the music to which this ex-
tract from a sleeve note re-
fers. It was taken from a
new set of "Nonesuch"
records, Polydor's subsidi-
ary label, in which electronic
and contemporary music is
presented.
There are five single LPs,
Kenneth Garburo's Music
for voices, instruments and
electronic sounds," Andrew
Rudin's "Tragoedia," Iannis
Xenahis and Krzystof Pen-
derecki, John Cage and
Lukas Foss's " Baroque
Variations," and Morton
Subotnik " Silver apples on
the moon."
This new batch takes
some time to play and even
longer to enjoy. A t first the
music tends to intrude rather
than form a background but
all the records are well pro-
duced and retail at about
25/- each, good value for
the converted and the ad
venturous.
An interesting point arises
from the Garburo sleeve
note. " Y o u are required
to assemble isolated pho-
nemes, words and word
chains by, way of mental
juggling activity." Instruc-
tion presumably on how to
construct an approachable
form of the music; I feel it
would be better " juggled "
before recording.
The collection also in-
cludes a boxed double L P .
"The Nonesuch guide to
eloctronic music." Very in-
formative and the opening
track, " Peace Three " is
excellent but would suit a
record library rather than a
personal collection, m less of
course you're kinky .or pure
sine waves and sawtooth
waveforms, etc.
If anyone knows of the
"Jasperson resonance chart"
please drop a note to F E -
L I X , also experimenting in
electronic music.

At the last Guilds Union meeting, a copy of F E L I X is
waved hysterically in the air as Chris Parker proposes a
motion of censure on this popular publication. Because
of jeering from our loyal supporters, very little of his
speech was heard!
FESTIVAL
OF
FOOLS
F E S T I V A L O F FOOLS '68
A new perspective for
fool-watching is provided
by the F E S T I V A L O F
FOOLS '68 when Ewan
MacColl and the London
Critics Group deliver this
year's edition at a London
pub-theatre (New Merlin's
Cave, Margerv St., W.C.I)
from 27th to 30th December
and from 1st to 12th Janu-
ary. It is produced and
directed by Ewan MacColl,
assisted by P e g ^ Seeger,
and Written by MacColl and
the London Critics Group
and a group of young singers
and writers.
F E S T I V A L O F FOOLS
'68 uses song, poetry, drama
and mime to dissect and re-
veal the events of 1968—
their facts, their implica-
tions, their inanities. Often
direct, but more often sati-
rically hilarious, FESTI-
V A L O F FOOLS '68 inverts
the world to present it as it
is . . . not as one might wish
it to be. The inferences are
surprising, disturbing, per-
haps angering. The con-
clusions are open to the
harsh realm of choice.

ALL MY
LOVING
" A l l my Loving" was the
most stirring piece of tele-
vision to appear in recent
months. Apparently the
director, Tony Palmer, is
prepared to show the colour
film and talk about it after-
wards. Can some society
organise this? A unique
opportunity.
