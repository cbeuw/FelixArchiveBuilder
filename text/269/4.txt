JAPAN
"Japan is a state of
mind —so say past obser-
vers—meaning everything is
related to everything else
and oversimplification is
dangerous .
My first impressions of
Japan were from Tokyo : —
huge sprawl, buzzing with
great throngs of people all
the time, motor cars, noisy
streets, crowded trains, neon
signs, full shops, crazy gam-
bling arcades, the hard sell
—other towns are similar.
Simultaneous with this
Japan you can be shown
" ancient Japan " : — Tem-
ples (for 10,000 religions),
the tea ceremony, national
dress (kimono), ancient
dancing, Geysha girls, com-
plicated customs.
Some western people be-
lieve that " ancient Japan "
is preserved only for the
tourist and has been largely
superceded by " modern
Japan," which is an imita-
tion America. I do not
accept this view, both
" Japans" operate simul-
taneously and together.
Most Japanese live in small
houses with ratomi (bamboo
matting)bedroom, wear the
kimono as it suits them, un-
derstand the importance of
the tea ceremony (every
educated young girl has
learned it), eat Japanese
food with chop sticks, re-
spect and use the temples
occasionally), revere Japa-
nese morals, manners and
customs. Coca-Cola, pop,
fast cars, gambling and ima-
ges of swinging London go
hand in hand with the rest
of life but will not supercede
it—as - typical Japanese girl
would tell you—even if she
was chewing gum. It i* in-
teresting to note that wes-
tern style" dance halls in
Japan do not function in at
all the way you might expect
them to, and many Japanese
young people imagine there
is some kind of " step " to
" go-go " (party dancing).
The Japan "paternalistic"
travel bureau might give the
wrong idea about Japan.
You need to go on a few
slow trains, sleep on some
stations and go off the tour-
ist tracks to discover the
Japanese people. Every-
where you go the people are
very kind, polite and ex-
tremely helpful apart from
being a little curious about
you; but westerners who
have a habit of taking sel-
fish disadvantage of the self-
lessness of others should
learn an ancient Japan. °.
saying " Never ask even
your father to do something
for you unless it is neces-
sary."
Japanese people are very
ready to accept foreigners
who are genuinely interested
in Japan but have preferen-
ces—a student told me that
Japanese preferred English
to Americans because they
have " cultural and historic
experience and appreciation,
but the Americans do not."
Finally I should say what
the " national character "
respects—in England it is
inventiveness, high quality
and high performance—in
Japan it is hard work, the
ability to learn from others,
and study.
PIERS C O R B Y N
In the summer I was a
member of a third year
group project arranged with
the University of Sierra
Leone through contacts in
the I C Electrical Engineer-
ing Department. i
There were some difficul-
ties in organising the pro-
ject. T o begin with there
were two military coups in
Sierra Leone during our
time of correspondence. The
second major problem was
money. The first break
came with £75 from the Old
Centralians and useful con-
tacts were supplied by their
Secretary Mr. Holbein, as
well as by the Pro-Rector,
Lord Jackson of Burnley. I
would suggest that the only
way to finance a trip like
this is peronal contact!" The
Last summer I spent ten weeks in Zambia, not far from
the Congo border, working in one of the copper mines.
This was made possible by winning an Anglo-American
Vacation Scholarship, which comprised the air fare to and
from Zambia, pay at £70 per month, a four-bedroomed
bungalow (shared with four others), a houseboy and a
bicycle.
biggest support came from
the John Beard travelling
fund of the Institution of
Electrical Engineers who
contributed £300.
Our work included instal-
ling a 15kVA generator, re-
pairing a smaller one, erect-
ing li miles of overhead lir r
and designing a hydro
scheme.
J O H N T . G R A Y .
The work one was given
depended on one's course,
and to a certain extent what
one was interested in. As a
mechanical engineer I spent
one month on the surface
and one month underground
(being concerned with plant
maintenance). However,
like any. industrial training
it depended on the indivi-
dual how much benefit he
got from the work.
On the social side, meet-
ing people was made much
easier by joining some of the
many sports clubs. Girls
were in short supply but not
impossibly so, judged by the
fact that one student had
four girls clamouring to play
with him in the mixed tennis
tournament and he wasn't
even a good tennis-player.
In the evening life tended
very much to revolve around
the bottle. A t week ends
there was usually a private
party to go to. These varied

Frankfurt, Saltzburg, Sa-
lonika, Istanbul, Damascus,
Baghdad, Esfahan, Teheran,
Herat, Kabul, Khyber Pass,
Lahore, Simla, Delhi—what
do these names have in com-
mon? Those who are map
addicts and others who take
an interest in the activities
of the Sunday Express and
Sunday Telegraph will re-
cognise these as being
roughly on the route to
India.
The Commonwealth Ex-
pedition 1969—COMEX III
is already under way des-
pite the political troubles
met with by C O M E X I in
1965 and the tragedy of
C O M E X II. While Mr. Wil-
son with his infamous ma-
chinations with Ian Smith
advances another step in •
wrecking the Common-'
wealth, 500 people are de-
ciding to go overland to
India to demonstrate their
faith in it.
Being a member of COK
E X II, I can safelv assert th's
is an experience not to be
missed and once accom-
plished, not to be forgotten.
To give an idea of what
C O M E X does and achieves
it suffices to quote some
comments on it.
" O n 29th July, Duncan
Matthew, leader of the Scot-
tish contingent of C O M E X
I, was married to Rosie
Roberts of the same con,.n-
gent. Early in July, Bob
iBebbington of Cambridge
and Julie Harris of Cardiff
were married. There may be
others!"
" There is no signpost to
Delhi from Charing Cross
but the road over London
Bridge was approximately
in the right direction."
"In Turkey, an additional
navigating task is to wave to
little boys with stones in
their hands so that they will
drop them to wave back in-
stead of throwing them."
" In Iran we discovered
the meaning of the word
corrugation. The road is
made up of regular humps,
four feet apart, between
three and six inches high,
continuing for 400 miles.
(The optimum speed is 27
mph for minimum oscilla-
tion.)"
"The second night of
C O M E X II—Concert of
dances, choirs and jazz mu-
sic . . . there could be no
doubt about it, this is what
the Delhi boys and girls
wanted. Long after the
show was over you could
not separate the Delhi teen-
agers from their counter-
parts of C O M E X . " (More
goodwill was achieved than
all the politicians of the
Commonwealth can hope to
produce.)
C O M E X III will depart
on 15th July 1969 and re-
turn to London on 8th Oct.
Now that practically all
of Europe has come within
the scope of three-week
package tours, F E L I X looks
beyond our little backyard.
Summer vacations offer
students the time to go al-
most anywhere in the world,
while there are many orga-
nisations which offer the op-
portunity, through cheap
charter flights or in other
ways. Longer journeys
inevitably require earlier
planning—now is the time
to start acting. Many of
these organisations are listed
in our "details" column,
while elsewhere some IC
people tell you what they
did last summer. You can

from boozy bottle parties to
extravagant barbecues, with
a group to provide the mu-
sic, and enough drink to
keep the School of Mines
paralytic for a year.
During our time there we
were given ten days paid
leave. Most people took it
at the end of the stay, there-
by having effectively a fort-
night. Some people used
this time travelling to Cape
Town to come back by boat,
living like millionaires for
eleven long days, spending
all their hard-earned sav-
ings. Others, like me, by
hitch-hiking and hiring a car
toured Zambia, seeing the
Kariba dam, the Victoria
Falls and the Fafue game
parks, places you normally
seen only in films.
Although Zambia is not
a place I am likely to return
to, and at' times life was
extremely dull, I found the
scholarship very worthwhile
for the first-hand knowledge
I received of this part of
Africa in political, racial
and economic terms.

Two hours later I was installed in a large luxurious hotel

M y first evening was spent
in a bar—quite unlike Eng-
lish pubs—talking to five
American youths amidst re-

RAKESH MOHAN AUSTRALIA
Early last July, 120 students met at the English Speak-
ing Union in Charles Street having won places on a 12-
week visit to Australia. The briefing, accompanying the
handing out of tickets was short and to the point, with
frequent warnings of " when-in-Australia-do-as-the-Aus-
tralians " type.
Our flight left in the early evening and arrived in Aus-
tralia 24 hours later, after stops at Bahrain, Karachi and
Singapore.
The trip, whose full title
was The 1968 Australian
working visit for British Un-
dergraduates, was the 6th to
be run by the ESU. There
are two qualifications : you
must be an Undergraduate
at a British University, and
you must have £150 to pay
for the air fare. If they
like you at the interview,
you will get a seat on the
plane; you usually hear
about a month after the in-
terview.
A condition of the trip is
that you should work for
eight weeks or more, al-
though some people seemed
to work for less time. The
job is arranged before you
leave England by ESU, who
take into account your own
preference. The final con-
firmation is left to you—
if you are unlucky a small
fortune can be spent on air
mail letters to Australia. I
was lucky enough : I asked
for a job with an Agricul-
tural Engineering firm in
Western Australia, prefer-
ably in Perth. What was ar-
ranged for me was Produc-
tion Engineering and Re-
search and Development
work with a firm making
tractors and ' farm ma-
chinery, some five miles
from the centre of Perth.
I lived with the family of
one of their employees. The
benefits of this were two-
fold : I had a good chance
to see the Australian way
of life at first hand, and it
enabled me rapidly to dis-
cover the ins and outs of my
job. Other students lived in
hostels, flats, hotels, or one
room digs. I think living
with a family was as good as
anything.
Obviously enough, the
weekdays were spent at
work. A t the weekends I
would look round the city,
or fly to places like Kalgorie
or Pemberton. The Austra-
lians spend much of their
time at weekends eating bar
bequed steaks in their na
tional parks, and you. will
likely find yourself doing
the same.
After working, there are
several weeks to spare be-
fore flying back. A number
of people flew round the
continent; this is an expen-
sive way to spend the time
A friend and I bought a
seventeen year old Austin
pointed it,towards Sydney,
and set off. Three days and
a thousand miles later, two
exhaust valves burnt out,
on the edge of the Nul-
labor desert. After a day's
delay while new valves were
brought from Adelaide 400
miles away, we set off again.
We reached Sydney four
days before our return flight
after another change of
valves. We got only £5 (a
loss of £40) for our mobile
museum-piece, and the end
of a fascinating journey of
three thousand miles.
Over the whole trip I
spent £40 on top of the £150
for the plane : it would be
hard to live for three months
and travel 35,000 miles for
less than £190.

took a frightening flight
right into the canyon and
took some very good photo-
graphs.
To St. Louis next, through
Page Cedar City and Denver
(again); Here I lost my
baggage but managed to
retrieve it after two hours.
I had to change my plans of
going to Chicago because of
riots there so flew via Nash-
ville to New Orleans.
I found New Orleans
second only to San Fran-
Cisco. It was suffocatingly
humid but the jazz was
great.
A couple of days before
my home flight was due to
leave I travelled to New
York via an English A i r
Force base, where I had to
surrender my camera, and
Washington. I arrived back
just in time to catch my
flight back to the damp
green fields of England.

The International Association for the Exchange of
Students for Technical Experience will send students over-
seas to jobs in industry relating to their University course.
Preference is given to second year students and to students
who have had industrial experience in Britain. The number
of places available abroad depends largely on the number
of overseas students seeking employment in British industry.
Students have to make their own travel arrangements but
IAESTE will obtain work permits and make special
arrangements in certain cases to allow work for a limited
period (for example, in the U.S.A., where you may other-
wise be in danger of being drafted.) Insurance against
personal accident and baggage loss is strongly advised and
can be arranged through Sanders' International Travel
Ltd.. 134/136 Cromwell Road, T e l : 373 6401.
Applications should be made to Mr. Meacock at the
Registry.
B.U.N.A.C.
The British Universities North America Club, as its name
implies, is concerned solely with the States and Canada.
It arranges cheap transport and sometimes employment
there, though the latter may not be connected with the
student's course. Would-be travellers must be members of
B U N A C for six months before they intend to go abroad,
and it costs 10s. to join. Applicants need not be under-
graduates, but a separate society I N T E R G R A D has been
set up for ex-BUNAC members. Anyone interested should
see Chris Schofield, 464 Selkirk, or S. Mudan, 73 Weeks.
The B U N A C office is at 157 Victoria St., S.W.I. Tel. 828
3577, and the actual travel arrangements are made through
the British Universities' Student Travel Association,
BUSTA, at the same address.
E.S.U. (with Comex)
The English Speaking Union of the Commonwealth
arranges visits to Australia every summer for British-born
undergraduates. Applicants should apply as early as pos-
sible (the closing date is March 14th). The E S U also
awards travel scholarships to American Universities for
graduates. Further details can be obtained from ESU,
Dartmouth House, 37 Charles Street, Berkeley Square,
W . l . Tel. 629 7400.
B.U.S.A.
The British Universities Society of Arts. This is mainly
concerned with finding jobs in South Africa (usually around
the Johannesburg area) for students during the summer
vacations. Although it is not always possible, BUSA will
try to arrange your job before you leave for South Africa
and will also find you lodgings. Science students can
usually be employed with the mining companies and the
average wage is about £15 to £20 a week. BUSA will make
travel arrangements, or you can make your own. It is best
to apply around February or March and the subscription is
10s. Further details from B.U.S.A., 32 Shaftesbury Ave.
W . l . Tel. 437 7270 and 437 0821. BUSA also arranges
travel to North America, East Africa, India and Singapore.
U.N.S.A.
The United Nations Students Association deals with
travel to the States, Africa, and India at cheap rates. Like
B U N A C , U N S A requires students to be members for six
months beforehand, and it also makes its travel arrange-
ments through BUSTA. It is more for students who wish
to be shown around the country they're visiting, and
arranges tours and visits to places of interest there. More
information can be obtained from the UNSA offices at 93
Albert Embankment, S.E.I. Tel 735 0181.
N.U.S., G.S.T.S, and other foreign student organisatigns
The NUS does not arrange travel outside Europe, but
membership is essential if you want to take advantage of
the numerous travel services operated by all the European
student organisations. The NUS is at 3 Endsleigb St., W.l.
T e l : 387 1277, and the German Student Travel Service at
Terminal House, Lower Belgrave Street, S.W.I. This will
make arrangements fev travel on their own services, and
also arranges special tours in various countries such as
Russia. India, and Africa, for which English students are
^eligible. ^
