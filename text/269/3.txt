THEY TELL ME....
JURGO
The first meeting of
JURGO—The joint Union-
Rectors-Governors Commit-
tee—was held on Monday
Dec. 2nd. The chairman was
Lord Penney, former direc-
tor of the Atomic Weapons
Research Establishment and
new Rector of Imperial Col-
lege, and the main purpose
of the meeting was to advise
the Governing Body on
disciplinary procedures in
I.C. J U R G O is composed
of the Rectors, ICU Council
and three Governors and
like any sensible body of
negotiators I C U Council
met prior to the JURGO
meeting to discuss a papei
on discipline from the Go-
verning Body. A number of
decisions were made and
stands for the meeting adop-
ted. It is clearly minuted by
Council that one of the prin-
ciples they would fight for
would be that nobody
should ever be punished
twice for the same offence.
It is probably one of the
oldest principles of English
Common Law that nobody
can ever be tried twice for
the same offence, and to
have this written into any
college code of discipline
would be elementary natural
justice, thus making it im-
possible for the Rector, or
anybody, to try students on
charges which the police
had already taken up.
Sell-out
Unfortunately, to Lord
Penney such a principle
would undermine the right
of the Governors " to safe-
guard the good name of the
college," and the Rector was
determined that J U R G O
should agree that the " good
name of the college" was
more important than justice.
ANN SHEPHERD
By all accounts the Rector
as chairman was prepared to
steam-roller his views
through, and, in fact, his
task was made easier by a
disgusting sell-out by certain
Council members. Barry
Hood, Secretary of Mines,
who spent the relevant sec-
tion of the Council meeting
reading " The Evening
News," (that well-known
pro-I.C. " news" paper),
actually spoke in favour of
the double punishment. I.C.
President, Rex Lowin, who,
in contrast, we have always
thought took his duties re-
sponsibly, also spoke for
double punishment on cer-
tain occasions. Chris Kent
and Lilas Campion are also
said to have failed to stand
firm on Council's agreed de-
cision.
Two points thus arise—if
Carnival
Walk
189 students turned out
for the Carnival walk last
Friday, and together raised
about £1,000. Each walker
was sponsored for a certain
amount of money for each
mile walked.
They set off with varying
degrees of keenness—some
ran, some went straight
into the pub until closing
time. A t Kingston (for the
second time), which was 16
miles out, there was coffee
waiting, and back at college
a hot breakfast cooked by
none other than Mooney in
person awaited the walkers
at the end of their 27 mile
trek.
The success of the event,
which has raised a substan-
tial part of Carnival's target
total, musf be attributed to
Maggie Hymans and Paddy
Sterndale, the organisers.
ICA
Fluorescent
Chrysanthemum
A n exhibition of modern
Japanese art in many media
—sculptures, graphics, pos-
ters, music, visual scores
and films. It is so called be-
cause the chrysanthemum is
the ancient Imperial symbol
of Japan and many contem-
porary Japanese artists work
with fluorescent plastics and
pigments. Showing until
January 26th, this exhibition
will be reviewed by FELTX
next term.
Note that I C A member-
ship is closing for several
months on 31st December.
There is a possibility of IC
becoming a group member
of ICA—watch out for fur-
ther details if you are inte-
rested in joining.
J U R G O is not a real con-
sultative body but merely a
rubber stamp to the Rector,
as most of Council now seem
to think, then it is even more
useless than we thought; if
Hood and Lowin, in particu-
lar, are prepared to back
down on this issue, and al-
low IC to further punish
people that the law of the
'and feels have been ade-
quately punished, then the
students at this college no
longer want them as their
representatives and they
should resign.

Waste
Perhaps in the near future
ICU Exec will tell us how
much has been lost on sub-
sidies for the various Balls
and Dances now run for the
in-crowd. Many people
think that Ents profits could
be better spent than on
functions such as the Presi-
dent's Dinner and Dance.
At this function, held on
the last Friday of the Sum-
mer Term, about £400 is
spent by the President giv-
ing free tickets to those who
have helped him during the
year. The guests are divided
into two classes—the five-
pennies who receive a dinner
ticket and the fourpennies
who only receive a dance tic-
ket, both double of course,
Many in protest stay away
and last "year a number of
people made a more tangible
protest against waste and
" cronyism " by giving the
money they would have
wasted on DJ's etc. to " War
on Want."
All this has forced I C U
Council to set up a sub com-
mittee to discuss the affair.
It consists of Jane Pearson,
ex-Con. Soc. Chairman Rex
Lowin, ex-Con Soc vice-
Chairman, Keith Guy, an-
other ex-Con. Soc. Chair-
man, Jeff Steer, Union
Deputy President, Piers Cor-
byn and popular Vinod
Garga. Piers and Vinod are
fighting for the comprehen-
sive rethinking of the D and
D—perhaps including it with
the May Ball to which all
the U L U Presidents are in-
vited to consume free liquor.
Lowin, Steer and Pearson
are basically opposed to
change whereas Guy would
like to make the whole af-
fair more exclusive and take
it to a private hotel.
Maybe they will deign to
consult the ordinary Union
member before the tickets
go out this year, and then
again maybe they won't, as
it is unlikely that ordinary
members would support the
idea of free beer for the
bosses.

Strong Characters
and Strong Language
A review of last weeks' Dramsoc. Christmas P,v ..uction.
Serjeant Musgrave's Dance is a play well suited to Dram-
Soc's talents. It is about war, the men moulded by war
and the unchanging reaction of ordinary people to war.
Strong characters and strong language dominate and the
unusual use of verse and ballads at critical moments is
particularly successful in the final prison scene. On the
whole a vital pace is kept up—a slightly sticky patch de-
velopes in the second aCt—and the final " dance is both
gripping and chilling. The production did however lack
any of the sense of history which Arden intended.
In a play with many different scenes, the sets were
excellent and the standard of acting generally good. Par-
ticular mention must go to Julian Robertson as a thoroughly
convincing Musgrave. Of the other parts, the colliers
were consistently sound and Roger Gift gave a spirited
rendering of Joe the Bargee,
This was a very entertaining production—worthy of
much better support than it received on the Tuesday night.
How does your degree
qualify you for a
top job in industry?
Let's be frank. It doesn't. But it is a most valuable start.
You may feel that there is a great gulf fixed between your University course
and the sort of experience which leads to the highest positions in industry.
In a sense there is such a gulf and Unilever have taken steps to bridge it with
their Unilever Companies' Management Development Scheme.
This Scheme is designed to develop management skills in graduates of all
disciplines and give them the training and opportunities to become the people
who will, in future, be able to undertake high level responsibility in
Unilever Companies.
If you would like to know more about this Scheme, ask your Appointments
Officer for a copy of the booklet "Careers in Unilever 1969" or write to the
address shown below. This booklet is not a glossy graduate bait. It discusses
frankly, with examples from graduates who have recently joined Unilever,
what happens when you join; your likely future career; your financial
prospects; and even the reasons why some people leave (not many do—but
joining Unilever is not a life sentence!). It also tells you about the selection
procedure, and how you join the Scheme.
The minimum starting salary is £1,200 for a first degree, and more for
relevant post graduate study or experience—a Ph.D., for example, would
start at £1,500.
Apply now to your Appointments Officer or write to:
C. R. Stewart, Personnel Division, Unilever House, London, E.C.4.
Unilever will be visiting your University during the
Spring Term to interview students. Details of this visit
can be had from your Appointments Officer.
