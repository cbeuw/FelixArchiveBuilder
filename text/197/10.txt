TEAM RACES
During the past few weeks we
have experienced something of a
phenomenon at Lasham—we have
actually flown on every weekend
this term. However, the weather
now looks as if it has returned to
normal and we will undoubtedly
find ourselves doing everything
but flying in,the near future.
Although the club exists pri-
marily to make students into com-
petent aviators, it has also taken
on the rqle of broadening their
outlook. This is mainly done in
the " cottage" which has been
rebuilt by members of I.C. and is
owned by two staff members and
an ex-president of I.C. Here one
can learn how to brew highly
potent wines and how to remain
standing longer after consuming
them.
One brew which has proved
particularly outstanding is called
" Barmanspite ." after the name of
a local "hundred;" this fluid
contains about 25 per cent,
alcohol,, is extremely pleasant to
drink, leaves absolutely no hang-
over, yet after two or three glasses
. . . Unfortunately we only made
8 gallons this year and this took
three week,s to disappear—next
year we have decided to step up
production by 3,000 per cent.

I.C. EXCEL
Complete anihilation has been
meted out to L.S.E., Woolwich
and Northern by I.C. men's 1st
team this term. Such victories
have been due almost entirely to
to the large influx of new players
of high calibre, such as P. Fitz-
gerald, and S. Watamangura,
which the Club has been fortunate
to attract. The mixed doubles
team has also taken on a new
lease of life, defeating Q.M.C. in
the first match of the season. This
improvement has coincided with
the appearance of Miss D. Wokes
in the ladies' section.
CLOSE GAP
With five current internationals
and several British University
representatives competing, I.C.
did well to take second place in
the U . L . Swimming Champion-
ships at the Nuffield Pool on
November 13th. The standard
was far higher than in previous
years, all the individual events
going to well-known names. Best
performances for I.C. were those
of C. Davis, 2nd in the 100 yds.
butterfly, and Christie, 3rd in the
diving.
At the end of the individual
events, Guys were well in the lead
through ROfddy Jones, their
British international, but in the
team races, good performances
by N.C.L. enabled I.C. to close
the gap with a couple of third
placings and finish an overall
second.
As runners-up, I.C. maintained
a consistancy in University swim-
ming over the past three years,
having won in 1961, and finished
3rd last year.

SNOOKER |
The Snooker Club has got off
to a good start, and has been able
to field two teams. So far, the
" A " team has played the Patent
Office and Morganite Carbon, the
results being 2-1 and 1-2 respec-
tively.
At present, the Freshers' Tour-
nament is in progress and al-
though still in the early stages,
interest is growing as the semi-
finals are reached. All members
are eligible for the forthcoming
handicap tournament and should
sign on the noticeboard as soon
as possible.
