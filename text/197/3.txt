Is Church unity possible and
desirable? These are questions
most Christians are facing at the
present time, especially Anglicans
and Methodists.
Representatives of the two
Churches officially met together
to discuss this problem, and since
they began their conversations in
1956 they have published two re-
ports on the subject. The first
was an interim statement pub-
lished in 1958 and the second was
the final report suggesting ways in
which unity could come about.
The two Churches have decided
to study and discuss these reports
over the next two years before any
action is taken.
Here at College these important
documents have not escaped the
notice of either the Anglican
Chaplaincy or Methodist Society.
Both societies are studying the
reports of the " Conversations "
separately, and also together. A
series of joint meetings have been
arranged at which speakers from
the Anglicans and Methodists
will be giving accounts of their
Churches, their beliefs, and their
attitudes to the reports.
Two such joint meetings have
already taken place, one last term
and the other last Monday, This
latter meeting was addressed by
Rev. Neville Ward, the Methodist
chaplain, who based his tatkf on
the similarities between the two
Churches. He later answered
questions, with Father Ivor, about
the Methodist Church, and epi-
scopal ordination.
A n attitude of shyness and
uncertainty still prevails at these
joint meetings, with one side not
wishing to offend the other. How-
ever, as °time progresses it is
hoped that they will prove very
profitable in introducing Anglican
beliefs to Methodists and vice-
versa. The next joint meeting will
be held on Monday, November
4th (at 5.15 p.m. in the upper
lounge, South Side), when laymen
from both Churches will be speak-
ing.
Who or what is the Larkl
Now it can be revealed.
" The Lark " is the next pro-
duction by the Imperial College
Dramatic Society. This play by
Jean Anouilh, translated by
Christopher Fry, tells the story of
Joan of Arc. Her story has been
used many times, but it has been
written that this version is " the
best play about Joan of Arc
which the English Theatre has
seen."
The play is written as a series
of flash backs into Joan's past,
interwoven into her trial as a
witch. These continual changes
of /scene (mean that the set is
simple and symbolic, consisting
mainly of rostra and drapes.
The conflict between Joan's
clerical judges is introduced; be-
tween Cauchon, Bishop of Beau-
vais, who sympathises with Joan
and the French cause, and the
Inquisitor and Promoter, who
consider her the instrument of the
devil. Also present is Earl of
Warwick, representative of the
English King, who merely wants
Charles, King of France, discre-
dited through Joan.
Through this mass of intrigue
and hatred, Joan emerges as a
simple peasant girl, not a saint or
a warrior maid. She firmly be-
lieves in her capture and aban-
donment. Warwick describes her
as " a lark singing over the heads
of the French army."
" The Lark " is an exciting and
interesting play and should not be
missed. The performances are on
December 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th
and tickets are on sale in the
Union Entrance Hall at 3/- and
4/-

APPL* IN CONFIDENCE
AT THE FILM
'THE TRIAL'
based on Kafka's
novel of the same title.
In his film " The Trial," Orson
Welles once again displays his
tremendous technical ability.
And for this reason alone it is
worth making the journey to the
Cameo-Poly. Unfortunately the
acting doesn't measure up to
Welles' direction. Antony Per-
kins, in the lead, is too stylised
and mannered for the difficult
part of Joseph K , and since the
film revolves about K , many of
the finer points of the original
novel are lost. Even so the basic
point of Kafka's story, the exist-
ence of a man with his guilt con-
science, is made clear, although
much of the symbolism has been
brought up to date.
There are good performances
by Romy Schneider, Akim Tami-
roff, and Welles himself as a de-
cadent advocate, resplendent for
much of the time in a huge
baroque bed.
This film is worth seeing not
only because of Welles' superb
creation of atmosphere, but also-
because Romy Schneider is as
beautiful as ever.

LESS TALK
—MORE ACTION
The Anglican Chaplaincy ? It
used to be called the Church
Society. The new name is more
appropriate. Here you will see
the Church getting on with its
job—-not just being intellectual
and talking about it. Plenty has
been going on this term—besides
the usual Sunday and weekday
services, there has been hospital
ind parish visiting. It makes you
realise how well off yOu are. We
have had a day conference on
Missionary Work, too. There
were addresses from a fellow
from India, and from one who
has lived and worked with the
African people. A lot of our
work, both practical and finan-
cial, is in support of Missions.
We have had three meetings
with the college Methodists since
the recent report was published
outlining possible ways towards
Unity. Each has much to offer
the other, and we are learning all
we can about our two Traditions.
We are not just talking—-we
mean business !! Why not come
to the next joint meeting on Mon-
day, December 2nd ?
Our Annual Dinner was on
November 11th, and Mr. Mooney
excelled himself-. There were 125
people there, and we had a great
evening. The Guest speaker was
Miss Balerie Pitt, who is known
as " That Woman " in her parish,
because she stirs ! She has the
guts to speak up about things
though.
The Teaching Week is coming
next term.
