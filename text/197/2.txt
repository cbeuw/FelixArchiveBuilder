WATSON MEETS COMBES—PRESIDENT INTERVIEWED
The President of the Union and the Editor met over a tape
recorder in the Union Office one day last week. Inevitably the pur-
pose of the Union was discussed with special reference to the function
T)f a constituent College within this framework. A student of 18
on arrival at South Ken. is taken by the Constituent Union and intro-
uced to corporate college life by breaking down his inhibitions.
In effect these Unions are an introduction to the Imperial College
Union and lead logically to that end.; I.C.U., however, although it
might do, does not provide a platform to NUS.
—on practical grounds I am CAMBRIDGE AND
against it—•
—have your views changed at
all since becoming President—:
—No, my basic argument is
that we still need more people
with ability and enthusiasm to
organise our own Union. I don't
think we would make a worth-
while contribution to NUS or
benefit from an association with
NUS.—
IMPERIAL
—You were at Cambridge;
where do you think a student gets
the better education ?
—Taking education in the
broadest sense, and comparing an
undergraduate here, and one
there, Cambridge undoubtedly
gives a better education! I would
have hated to be an under-
graduate at Imperial.

There were only 40 bopping
days to Christmas when 500 dis-
criminating jazz lovers invaded
South Side on November 13th to
gyrate to the wailing offivebands.
Mr. Rothwell started the proceed-
ings by stamping six times on the
stage with his metal-heeled boot.
The Kensington City Stompers
then played " That's a -Plenty,"
following it with several other
items in the Traditional idiom.
The second set was blown by
the Clive Heath quartet, who
produced a nice tidy sound on
"Night Train" and other offer-
ings. Rimshot Gold Star to Mr.
Heath. Then followed ap interval
in which the electronics experts
demonstrated how, by subde
placing of microphones, five
singers could be rendered totally
inaudible. Rimshot Consolation
Award to the Wayfarers folk
group.
Mr. Hopkins then led his main-
stream sextet into a bouncing
version of " Now's the time," the
front line cunningly observing
their solo power by blowing king-
size riffs at each other. Happy
is a very broad tenor player, and
he generated great excitement on
"'Beginning to see the Light,"
passing from frenzy to abandon in
" Undecided."
The funk spot of the evening
wasfilledby the RirXiard Rushton
quartet, who ladled out soul ren-
derings of " Sack of Woe,"
" Sister Sadie " and " Moanin' "
with great spirit. Mr."Rushton has
since been nominated for the
Duke of Edinburgh Rolling Stone
Award, and the Dankworth Cup
for original work on the alto.
For those people who are still
interested in jazz, the following
events should be noted. The
U.L.U. jazz competition is being
held. at U.L.U. on Saturday
November 30th, so why not come
along to listen and support us?
If you still want more, come to
our lunchtime concert on Tuesday
December 3rd in the Concert
Hall. It's free.
Finally, the Jazz Club would
like to congratulate Richard
Rushton and Dave Cain, who
were in the winning band at the
Richmond Jazz Festival in the
summer, and later came third in
the European competition in
Zurich. Who said I.C. only pro-
duced engineers?
RIMSHOT
—Why ?—
—It's large and impersonal, a
9 to 5 college—
—But the Constituent colleges
should help here—
—Yes, they can help to hu-
manise the place; to make it a
place of people, not statistics.
—Is there anything we can
learn from Cambridge—
—The main thing we can learn
from it is the extent to which
members of thei staff meet, mix
with, and talk to students on a
social level, after 5 o'clock—
—Why is this not so here ?
—'The origins are historical—
—Do you think an improve-
ment could he effected by staff
writing in Felix ?
—This would be a very good
thing. If Felix can do anything
to encourage this it would have
made a great contribution to the
problem.
Out of Touch
—Are you sufficiently in touch
with the student to appreciate his
position ?
—It is true that the President
does not mix much with the stu-
dents, but he must have done so
to a tremendous extent before he
is elected. He must base his
actions in his year as President
on that experience.
—Can the President now get
elected merely by knowing Coun-
cil who elect him ?—
—No; to get elected a man
must know a considerable
amount about the student and
his aims; otherwise he won't get
elected.—
A Mature Minority
—-The average student is very
much less mature than the aver-
age President; what sort of
student are you catering for ?—
—'3,000 mature students ; it is
the function of the President to
give the student what the student
wants.
—We have not got 3,000 ma-
ture students; might the tradi-
tional I.C. apathy be due to the
fact that you are catering for
students you actually haven't
got?
—If we turn out 600 students
who can run their own affairs we
can be proud. I personally am
sorry that more students do not
take an interest • many will regret
it later—
—So you cater for a minority ?
—Only in that 60 people who
know what they want' are a
minority ?
—Surely you should educate
those who don't know what they
want ?
—'Yes, this is part of my func:
tion ; but in the last analysis it is
not for me to force on people
what they dont' want.—•
And at that point the tape
ended. ,
An attempt by Mr. Cameron
to clamp down on parties in Tiz-
zard Hall has been by-passed by
the Hall Committee. They have
formed a parties sub-committee
and applications should be made
to this body; parties will con-
tinue as before.
BUCHANAN
from Staff Reporter —'
Prof. C. A. Buchanan's long
awaited report will be finally re-
leased on Nov. 27th. Three years
ago he was briefed by the Ministry
of Transport to study the impli-
cations of the four fold increase in
road traffic during the next fifty
years on town planning. One of
his many projects has been to
study in particular a part of Lon-
don; his appointment last Octo-
ber as Professor of Transport at
Imperial College will have made
him aware of the problems facing
the student motorist here. His
comments on projected special
licenses for city motorists should
have special relevance to I.C.
motorists.
UNION
MEETING
Insurance
The next motion was that "this
Union should convey its wishes to
H.M. Government that students
should be credited with National
Insurance contributions whilst
undergoing full-time education."
Paul Carter outlined the Govern-
ment pamphlet on the subject " a
grotty little bit of paper." If we
don't pay a £100 while at the uni-
versity, our wives, our children,
and ourselves will suffer. He
wanted the methods I.C. had of
reaching the right people muted
during the N.U.S. debate last year
be used. Don Leper thought
that " if we were dependent on
pension for our livelihood our life
at I.C. had been wasted." The
motion was carried overwhelm-
ingly.
Apartheid
The final motion "That I.C.
Union condemns the application
of apartheid to students in South
Africa and instructs the Execu-
tive to raise a subscription fund
in support of South African cam-
paign for Higher Education"
was proposed by Tony Berry in a
fluent forceful speech. In second-
ing the motion, a Ghanaian
pointed out the difference between
being white and black in South
Africa. Black people had virtually
no education, no skilled jobs, and
they died much younger. He gave
a grim picture. Some people
doubted that it was that grim.
Don Leper suggested that a pri-
vate collection should be made.
Mark Lee thought that" it was a
matter of Union members indi-
vidual conscience." The motion
was carried heavily. The meet-
ing then closed.
This Union meeting was a suc-
cess, a success because many
people turned up, and a success
because sensible points were dis-
cussed. If other Union meetings
and' functions are as good as this
one, there is no truth in saying
that the Union is apathetic and
lacking in spirit.
