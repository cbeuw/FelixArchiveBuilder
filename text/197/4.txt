Dear Sir,
In reference to complaints
about the barber
We advise Mr. Apeji not to pay
any attention to what the barber
says to him; he is this way to
everyone. Just laugh and sit
downl
I waited for 20 minutes one
morning and in this time he said
the following to three students:
No. 1. " Mate, I'll need a pair
of hedge shears to go through that.
Go somewhere else." (He stayed.)
No. 2. " Have you ever tried
to cut a lawn that has not been
mowed for six months? Well
mate, I'm a barber and you are
that lawn . . .
No. 3. (who was trying to sign
up an appointment) " Don't
bother. If you think I'm going to
cut yours, it's a waste of time."
(He signed.)
None of the students were Afri-
cans, and they all got clipped1
.

Dear Sir,
As you may have seen from
this week's Sennet, Rag Mag '64
is being produced from within
LSE. We should greatly appre-
ciate your help in terms of a small
article in your paper asking for
contributions from within your
college.
There will be a prize for the
best feature (£50), and two for the,
best jokes. We hope this will
provide an incentive so that we
can get first-class material for the
Mag, instead of the usual plagiar-
ised rubbish.
This year the Mag will be
smaller, not larger as was said in
Sennet. We hope to fill 64 pages
of copy—32 with advertising, and
32 with editorial material. We
will have an initial print order of
50,000 with, if all goes well, a
further run on of 25,000.
The editor of the Mag is Mike
Cunningham, a' third year B.Sc
(Econ.) student, who will be glad
to receive all contributions at the
above address.
With many thanks for your
help,
I remain,
Yours sincerely,
LYDIA HAMMOND,
p.p.S. G. WANSELL,
Managing Director.

Dear Sir,
In your last issue I noticed that
slanderer, Colcutt, has had one of
his recurrent bouts of malicious
spitefulness towards a member of
this College, namely Frank Fuchs.
Now I am not a supporter of
Mr. Fuchs myself, nor anything
approaching it, but I do feel most
strongly that whenever a personal
attack of this kind is made—and
I stress the fact that Colcutt's
article as it is written is nothing
more or less than a^personal feud
-you should not, in your capacity
as editor allow it to be published
under a pseudonym. It is only
fair that when somebody is at-
tacked personally in public they
should be given a chance to reply
personally to the attacker; be
given a chance, so to speak, of
punching the aggressor on the
nose, and I think that in this case
Mr. Fuchs would be justified in
doing just that.
This College is supposed to be
a collection of reasonably adult
human beings, capable of a rea-
sonably broad outlook on life. We
may not like Mr. Fuchs for his
own sake or for his political views
(but mainly, I suspect for the
latter), but there is no need to
childish way.
express that dislike in such a

Dear Sir,
I would like to bring the atten-
tion of your readers to the fact
that this year, as last,
U.N.I.C.E.F Christmas Cards are
on sale in I.C.
These cards have been designed
by world famous artists and there
are 20 different designs.
Half of what you pay for a
card goes directly to work for
children. Such work includes the
provision of food, drugs, public
health services and education for
the 650 million children in the
developing countries.
The cards can be obtained in
boxes of 10 for 7/6d. from D.
Wilcock, 521 Tizard, and R. Ful-
lard, 62 New Hostel.
Yours faithfully,
DAVE WILCOCK.

bear Sir,
Allow me to congratulate,
through this paper, members of
the I.C. Union for passing the
motion which condemned the
South African Government policy
of apartheid in Education, and
which instructed the executive to
set up a fund towards the educa-
tion of the non-whites in that
country. The last gesture is worthy
of great commendation indeed.
I.C. has shown that she has not
only got a voice of her own, but
that she is capable of positive
action as well. And I feel
that somehow this show of
strength is not unconnected with
the reappearance of " Phoenix."
It is, however, important to be
sure that the support for the
motion came from the conviction
that apartheid in education was
abhorrent, and not out of senti-
ment. An amendment to the mo-
tion suggested the removal of the
last portion. This conveyed no-
thing but the attitude of the land-
lady who says to the negro stu-
dent, "I have nothing against you,
but I'm sorry I don't give rooms
to blacks." In plain terms, it is
hypocrisy, and it was gratifying
that this amendment was rejected.
" Do something in the motion, or
throw ft out\ ", one true l.C. man
said.
South Africa has had over half
a century to improve on her racial
policies, like another Western
country, and if the world outside
these countries does not act now a
lot of blood which is neither white
nor black will be shed. For even
a rat, when driven to a corner will
turn back and bite, and man, it
can do some damage.
Cynics are beginning to say that
the good which Christianity and
Western preachings of democracy
have for the non-white races is
reflected in the way these races
are treated in South Africa, and
many of the so-called Christian
countries. Actions, my dear Sir,
not words, can prove them wrong.

" The two great aims of the
Government are,Peace and Pros-
perity "—so began the talk given
by the Minister of Housing and
Wales, Sir Keith Joseph, at I.C.
last Tuesday. He spoke in the
Concert Hall to what he later de-
scribed as a " most sophisticated
and probing audience." . . .
Sir Keith, who joined the
Tory Party because he was inter-
ested in the Social Services, des-
cribed the British economy as
going up " in steps." " One of
the mistakes in Housing planning
was that the Government had
thought that people would spend
their increased wealth in leisure
rather than in babies. Even with
a static population, slums, old
houses and the war aftermath
demand a 1 per cent, increase in
housing each year and this is
already a tough order.
Commenting on Britain's rela-
tions with the emerging countries
he believed that " the more trad-
ing decisions we leave to private
enterprise the better." " The
emerging countries are our market
as well as our competitors."
" With conscious, deliberate, Go-
vernment planning we shall suc-
ceed."
An interesting point was Sir
Keith's evasiveness about land
and asking not to be quoted in the
press. The newspapers last week
told us why—he intends to intro-
duce the compulsory buying of
certain types of development land
in town areas. I wonder how the
Socialists feel about that.
GOODWIN WILL COME
AFTER A L L
After one postponement, G. L .
Goodwin will be coming to I.C.
on Thursday, November 28th, to
speak in the General Studies. As
Professor of International Rela-
tions at L.S.E., and author of
" Britain and the United
Nations " he should prove to be
an interesting and well-informed
speaker on the United Nations.
