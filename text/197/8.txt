A reception for postgraduate
freshmen was held recently in
Southside. Although only 25 per
cent, of the P.G's. invited came,
there were several members of
staff present and the evening was
successful. It is intended to hold
another reception next term.
The present form of the
Morphy Day rag was strongly
criticised at the last R.C.S. gene-
ral committee meeting. The
executive were instructed to ne-
gotiate with Guilds and Mines in
order to improve the proceedings.
L I T E R A R Y SOCIETY
At the end of the year R.C.S.
will lose its literary society. The
last meeting of the clubs commit-
tee decided that it was in the gen-
eral interest that the lit. soc.
should be open to all I.C. From
next year it will be known as the
I.C. Literary Society. The Society
was formed two years ago by
several students of the physics de-
partment and has been financed
by the R.C.S. union.
TYE AT MORPHY
BLOOD AND BEER
The blood doning stakes were
won by R.C.S. who gave several
more pints than the others.
Bloody good show!
Swimmers are wanted urgently
for the gala on the 6th of Dec.
Steve Rowe (P.G. Physics) has
taken over the captaincy and is
trying to build up a team. Chris
Tye denies strongly that he is in
training for the President's race.
He has admitted however, that he
can float well. Incidentally, the
next training session for future
beery leaders will be held after
the swimming gala at a secret
venue in the West End
The entertainments committee
are going grey and slimming very
quickly. However, they are win-
ning and the carnival on Friday
29th should be excellent. Guilds-
men and Miners will be very wel-
come if they join us on this
occasion. Buy your ticket now!
