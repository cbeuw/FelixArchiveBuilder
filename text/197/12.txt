NOONEY ACQUITTED
SQUARE MEAL MOONEY
A barrage of criticism has been directed at Mr. Moeney this
term (as in every term), via the J>outhside Suggestions Book. When
interviewed by Felix, however, the Refectories Manager had a reply
to nearly all his critics. Suggestions do not go unheeded and modi-
fications are not impossible.
Charged with dirty cutlery and unclean glasses, Mr. Mooney
replied that the modern South Side washing machines handle 3 to
4,000 pieces of cutlery, 2,000 plates, 500 glasses, etc.,. per day, so it
is unavoidable that an Odd one or two should appear unsatisfactory.
Cutlery is dried by hand to ensure cleanliness, but all plates and
glasses are dried by machine. So blame the scientist, not the Refec-
tories Manager.
On the suggestion that South
Side should run on a flow tech-
nique, (serve oneself with woman
replacing dishes), Mr. Mooney
thought this was a distinct pos-
sibility. He was waiting for " the
men" to modify the hot plate
rail (the one in a direct line of
sight between you and the beans),
then each student could carry his
plate down the line, being loaded
with ' peas, beans or greens " as
it went, thus encouraging a
greater rate of service.
Charge Two: Cold food. In the
Lower Union the hot plate runs,
at 140° whereas in South Side it
was designed for 115°. However,
cool food is largely a result of
poor ventilation, and this problem
has been inspected and will be
remedied.
Charge Three: 6.00 p.m. lack
of choice. Here, we must decide
whether it is better to have a full
menu up to 6.30 with food re-
maining, -esulting in increased
costs, and i mce, prices, or leave
the situation as it stands. The
demand varies in South Side by
about 40-50 meals per evening so
numerical predictions are impos-
sible.
Suggestions that the Snack Bars
of last term should re-open were
applauded by Mr. Mooney. It
is, however, a matter of College
policy that eating places should be
situated apart from academic
buildings, so we must manage
without, but not on Mr. Mooney's
account.
Charge Four: Late evening
service. Suppers are served until
8.00 in Weeks Hall, but due to the
inconvenience of cooking there, it
is hoped that it will be replaced by
all or part of the Staff Dining
Room, also serving till 8.Q0. If
closing times were put back, stu-
dents would still dawdle along
with five minutes to spare, so a
balance must be struck between
convenience to the student and the
cost of keeping a refectory open.
This balance lands on 6.30.
Charge Five: Queues. The
position has definitely improved
since the start of term. At present,
within five minutes Of 12.30 or
1.00, some 1,000 ravenous gentle-
men demand a meal. Thus, about
200 people per refectory, moving
at a service of seven per minute,
a fair figure, would still result
in a half-hour's queue. Two
cashiers have helped the situation,
but with the present number of
refectories, it is physically impos-
sible to improve the situation very
markedly. How many times do
you help by having the right
money?
In future, let those who have
never catered for three be less
severe on those who bear the re-
sponsibility of catering for 3,000.
Constructive criticism is welcome
scorn is not.
SHORT TAKES
The Vice-President of City
and Guilds fell down a London
Transport escalator while walk-
ing up it. At the time the offend-
ing escalator was going down.
He went to hospital later, but re-
turned with a Stick and a twisted
ankle.
A MUST FOR BEGINNERS
AH those interested in people
and reality must see - the film
"Cry the Beloved Country," to
be shown in General Studies on
Thursday, December 12th. A
must for beginners, and who after
all can claim not to be a be-
ginner ?
TOUCHSTONE, NOV. 30th
She speaker will be Professor
(charity before chastity) Carstairs.
His topic will be "The psycho-
logical consequences of rapid so-
cial Change."' Prof. Carstairs was
a Reith Lecturer in 4962, and
this weekend promises to be a
good one.
For details see notice boards.
I.C. PLANS
SURVEY
Published, we hope, by the end
of this term will be a survey of
the university advice received in
schools by students now at four
of London's colleges. The sur-
vey started a year ago within I.C.
Socialist Society and was
prompted by a uniform lack of
good advice at school. The con-
nection with the failure rate
seemed fairly direct but no socio-
logical work had been done in
the field; as-a result, and with
the assistance of a research assis-
tant at L.SJE. (now at the Home
Office) a questionnaire was de-
vised and circulated in a limited
way within I.C. The results were
tatttalisingly inconclusive on the
narrow sample taken; hence a
1 in 3 sample of all British-
educated freshmen at I.C., U.C.,
L.S.E., and Bedford was planned
and the questionnaire refash-
ioned.
We were extremely fortunate
throughout for the support we re-
ceived—from other helpers inside
the Socialist Society, from profes-
sional sociologists, from the regis-
trars of the four colleges them-
selves and, very important, from
N.U.S. financial support and
from a computer company for
the free processing of all our,
data.
All that remains to be done
now is to form our conclusions
from the computer—a first taste
for Felix when they are ready.
