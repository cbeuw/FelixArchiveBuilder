I.C. Union still remains outside
N.U.S., after a long struggle last
year which resulted in conflicting
votes at successive Union Meet-
ings. Newcomers to the College
like myself do not want the matter
to be closed; here from my ex-
perience is the case for entry.
The National Union of Students
is the only national organisation
for students in this country, and
represents some 80 per cent, of
those in full-time higher educa-
tion. It exists to further the wel-
fare and promote the interests of
its members; policy is determined
by student union delegates at
councils and is carried out by an
executive and permanent staff.
Political independance is main-
tained by limiting discussion and
action to matters directly affect-
ing students.
The facilities that N.U.S. offers
to individual members can only
be widely known and used if the
Union co-ordinates and publicizes
them. Some of these are: cheap
travel abroad, individually and
in organised holidays; the Inter-
national Student Card, providing
many concessions at home and
abroad; and a wide variety of va-
cation jobs and working holidays.
These benefits can save a student
pounds in a year.
N.U.S. speaks out and acts for
its members. It negotiates details
of grants both as a whole and for
individuals, and has had a large
measure of success. N.U.S. is
accepted as the representative
voice of students, and thus we in
I.C. are effectively unrepresented
outside College. This is tragic in
this period of educational advan-

ces—for example, what evidence
did we submit to Robbins?
N.U.S.'s expansionist education
policy is unique in giving prime
importance to student needs; we
should be giving it our full sup-
port.
Finally, membership really is
cheap—1 /3d. per student. (Com-
pare this with 15/- that an indi-
vidual member in I.C. pays now.)
That sum, backed up by an active
N.U.S. Secretary, can bring us
immense advantages and enable
I.C. to take a greater part in
national affairs.

CHRISTMAS
EXPULSION
The news that the college is to
close completely for ten days
over Christmas—from 20th to
30th December — has been
greeted with some dismay by
overseas postgraduates in the col-
lege. Faced with the prospect of
a cold and lonely week in a
shabby bedsitter, some are asking
whether the college authorities
are fully aware of the plight of
foreign students in London who
have no family or relations to go
to. Others, under pressure from
dwindling financial resources to
complete their research as
quickly as possible, are annoyed
that they are to be prohibited
from working for such a long
period.
It is believed that one of the
reasons for the long closure is
that the college authorities wish
to give postgraduates the oppor-
tunity of taking a holiday which
they might not take if they knew
that some of their colleagues
would be working. Pressure to
conform to patterns set by the
most consistent attenders does
impose strains on some students.
Yet the time of year seems to be
ill chosen. Given a Christmas as
cold as the last one, most people
prefer to stay indoors. With
T.V., friends and family this can
be enjoyable ; with none of these
it is dubiously so, especially to a
foreign student without Christian
beliefs and some research work
to finish in a hurry.
Departmental
Does colour vision deteriorate
with age? This question was
posed recently to the Technical
Optics department of I.C. by the
Medical Research Council. Ap-
parently, the " committee on hu-
man factor in railway accidents "
have been wondering for some
time why locomotive drivers
occasionally go past red lights.
Anyway, Professor Wright's de-
partment did an experimental
survey and came to the conclu-
sion that colour vision doesn't
deteriorate with age, which is
hard lines for the committee on
human factors in railway acci-
dents.
LIQUID OR SOLID ?
Things are not what they seem
when viewed through an electron
microscope. Professor M . Black-
man's- Department of Electron
Diffraction have discovered that
when a thin solid film of silver or
lead is being deposited on a sur-
face, the crystals behave as if they
were anything but solid. A cine-
film taken through the microscope
shows that when two crystals
touch they join together in a way
which is remarkably similar to
binary fission of an amoeba in
reverse. Explanation anyone?
Other investigations in this de-
partment include a study of the
crystal structure of solid neon and
oxygen at liquid helium tempera-
tures using electron diffraction
methods; also a study of super-
conductivity in various substances.
A current-carrying superconduc-
tor is remarkable in that there is
no magnetic field produced exter-
nal to it. Some materials (e.g.
lead) can be superconducting in
some sections of their length while
not in others. Where they are not
superconducting they produce a
magnetic field. A n overall picture
of such materials can therefore be
deduced by observing the deflec-
tion due to such fields, of an
electron beam.
