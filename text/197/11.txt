RUGBY CUP -
RAVNO KICKS FIVE VICTORY
I.C. 8 WOOLWICH 0
Imperial College move through to the second round of the
Gutteridge Cup after this well-deserved win over Woolwich. AH the
scoring came in the first quarter of an hour, however, leaving the
rest of the match rather devoid of interest for the four coachloads
of spectators who turned up to cheer them on.
I.C. moved into the attack
from the whistle. Within minutes,
prop-forward Ravno broke from
a line-out in the Woolwich " 25 "
but was stopped just short of the
line. A scrum infringement by
Havard enabled Woolwich to
gain some respite, but I.C. were
soon back, spurred on by the
cheering from the touchline.
I.C. Score
A scissors movement between
centres Turton and Armstrong
forced play right up to the Wool-
wich line, but their defence was
tackling well at this stage of the
game, and I.C. failed to score.
After 15 minutes of play, how-
ever, a wheel from the scrum
enabled speedy winger Churchill
to race on to a kick ahead and
beat the Woolwich full back to
the touch down. Ravno kicked
a beautiful conversion from the
touchline to make the score 5—0
to I.C.
No sooner had Woolwich
kicked off than I.C. were on the
attack again. Woolwich were
penalised near their line and
Ravno had no difficulty in
kicking the goal. 8—0, and it
seemed as though I.C. were go-
ing to romp away. Woolwich
were determined that this should
not happen, however, and with
play oscillating from one half to
the other no further score re-
sulted before half time.

Woolwich Attack
In the second half, play was
generally scrappy with the I.C.
three-quarters rarely in evidence.
I.C. would have scored again if
only they had tackled their men
low when following up the kicks
of the scrum and outside halves.
It was left to Woolwich to make
the first attack of the half, mainly
due to the relctance of I.C.
players (with the notable excep-
tion of open side forward Turner)
to fall on a rolling ball.
It was not until after 20 mins.
that I.C. got another chance to
score when they were awarded
another penalty. This time, how-
ever, Ravno's shot went wide.
From the drop out, the ball went
to Turton in the centre, who
made an outside break before
passing to Churchill on the wing.
Churchill made a dash forward
but was forced into touch just
short of the line.
Woolwich were now generally
forcing I.C. back across the half-
way line and stalemate ensued
until the final whistle ended I.C.
fears.
Athletics
PIPPED!
Having won a trophy at the
Winter Championships for so
many years back, the end had to
come sometime. The fact that it
came this year when we held
such high hopes of wresting the
Tjalve field event trophy from
Middlesex Hosp. was however a
great disappointment. We were
the runners-up in this by only
three points.
Despite this, it is still true to
say that our field events strength
is considerably greater this year
than last. D. Smith, returning
to I.C. as a Postgraduate in Con-
crete Technology, came second in
the triple jump with 45ft. logins,
and is capable of closing the gap
between this and 50ft. even fur-
ther. L . Hall only just dislodged
the bar at 6ft. in the high jump
and should become U.L. second
string in this event with a bit of
luck. Unfortunately, our throwers
were a little below form and this
was our downfall.
Our performance in the relays
was predictably low. After a
season when some of the best
U.L. runners belonged to I.C., we
are now left with little such po-
tential and our future on the
track this year looks dim.

League and Cup
I.C. have at last gained a point
in a league match. This was no
summit of achievement, however.
After being 2 goals,up against
Goldsmiths, the team slipped to
being 4-2 against in a manner
suggesting inexperience. Only a
spirited rally in the last 15 mins.
gave us the two goals and one
point. Two more league matches
remain this term and these must
be.won to maintain E C ' s soccer
reputation.
The Club has a cup match on
Saturday against this same Gold-
smiths. Our cup team, however,
is a completely different entity
from our league team. We have
SIX players in the U.L. 1st X I
and these are released to us only
for cup matches. This seems to
happen every year, and as a re-
sult, we have won the U.L. Cup
for the last 5 years whereas our
league record is no better than
that of any other large College.

Basketball
WOOLWICH
WIN
Woolwich 50,1,C. 37
I.C. Basketball Club have had
a bad start to the season in losing
their first two matches in both
the University and the London
Leagues — albeit to the two
strongest teams in each division
The last match in the University
League was at Woolwich where
I.C. went down to the Poly 37-50.
In the first half I.C. played a very
tight zone, defence which was
successful in keeping out the fast
Woolwich forwards and restrict-
ing them to hurried set-shots. In
attack, Alex Termanis played very
well under their basket and had
collected 8 points by half-time
when the score stood at 18-18.
During the second half, both
teams switched to a man-to-man
defence and although I.C.s
screening attack caused some con-
cern in the Woolwich defence,
their own defence was very
weak so that Woolwich's two
U.L.U. forwards soon built up
a commanding lead which I.C.
could not peg back when they
reverted to their more successful
zone defence. Ray Thomas played
well for I.C. in the second half,
scoring 11 points and Alex
Termanis ended with 10 points.
-CROSS COUNTRY-
NOTES
by Pete Crews
The club fixture list has been
full over the past fortnight. On
Wednesday 13th November we
were at home to Reading Univer-
sity, University of Sussex, Charing
Cross Hospital and L.S.E. The
difficulty of providing tea for 50
odd hungry runners Was compen-
sated for by the fact that we came
second to L.S.E.in the actual race.
Once again it was the stout effort
of the club as a whole that
brought this about.
Both U . L . and I.C. were at
Oxford on Saturday, 16th Nov.
While Dave Reaves and Chris
James were representing the Uni-
versity vs. Oxford, the rest of the
club had a trying afternoon run-
ning on Westminster College's
muddy course. Led by our con-
tingent of freshers we overcame
the foreign conditions and eventu-
ally defeated Westminster by 39
to 43. Meanwhile Chris and
Dave missed the U-L- match
through no fault of their own.
For some reason or other, the
start was held a quarter of an
hour early.
League positions are as follows:
League Div. I (10 teams):
I.C. I 5th I.C. II 10th
League Div. II (27 teams):
I.C. I l l 18th I.C. TV 25th
