DIM SWIM
At a recent Union Meeting, the
Mines President was challenged
by a second year man to swim
the Serpentine in accordance with
tradition. It was decided that
this be done at night to avoid ex-
cessive disturbance and mis-
understanding with the 'BULES.
So one night the two mines men
crept stealtily towards the Ser-
pentine at 12.30 a.m. The water
looked so inviting that these
sturdy youths leapt straight in
and their landing on the far
shore was recorded by a passing
Dutchman who was " Photo-
graphing ze birds at ze time."

KARTING
In this civilised country, the
motor car rally organised outside
the auspices of the R.A.C. is
strongly discouraged. This situ-
ation deprived the G. & G.
Motor Club of its only form of
motor sport and caused suitable
fermentation within the brains of
Watson and Klat, who quickly
came up with the idea of a karting
section within the club. Two
Class One frames were purchased
even more quickly with financial
assistance from the City & Guilds
Union and the Mechanical En-
gineering Department, and one of
these was modified to Class Four
rules, which give more scope for
developemedt, in time for an
appearance in the Carnival Pro-
cession and a few outings last
year.
This year will be the first full
year for the karting section and
there is much to be achieved. The
second frame has to be completed
and engine and frame tests have
to be carried out on present
equipment; The aims for {this
year are threefold. As many
drivers as possible will be trained
with a view to a possible race
outing at the end of this year. An
advanced design will be prepared
in co-operation with the karting
section by two members of the
Mech. Eng. Department as a
third year project. Further de-
velopments will be carried out on
the tuned engine which is now
giving 18 b.h.p,, no mean feat for
200 c.c.
Offerings
to Albert
A speaker at the R.C.S.A.
dinner and dance held in South-
side on Saturday, 16th Novem-
ber told of one old I.C. society,
now defunct, which would surely
have a great following if reformed
now. This was the society for the
adoration of the Albert Memorial,
which was formed in 1928 when
Beit Hall was opened. Worship
took place in the evenings, after
dinner, when burnt offerings and
other inedible meals were trans-
ported in procession from the
refectory to the memorial. These
dishes were then left on the step
as an offering to Albert. If this
society is reformed it will be
necessary to ask the ministry of
works to provide more steps, (as
space for offerings) and the min-
istry of transport to provide a new
set of traffic lights, to cater for the
processions.

CAVEMEN IN CITY
Cavemen and Brontauson cavorted through the streets of
London during the Lord Mayor's Show. As the Lord Mayor is
elected annually by the Guilds of London, our College is always
asked to take part in the Show. The papier mache cavemen heads
were supplied by a stone masonry company who have generously
given Guilds Union a donation towards a stone trophy. The stone
masons were most satisfied with the efforts of our Guildsmen, and even
the Lord Mayor paused to acknowledge the rousing Boomalaka from
Bob Schroter and the Guildsmen surrounding Bo and Spanner on
Ludgate Hill.
Telstar
Did you know that: 90 per
cent, of the world's telephone
ealls are south of the United
Kingdom ; Andover, Maine Tel-
star station cost £5 million,
Goonhilly cost ££ million ; Relay
1, successor to the Telstar satel-
lites can trasmit 900 telephone
calls simultaneously, and, even
now, Relay 1 is being used for
some transatlantic calls.
These, and many other inter-
esting facts, were expanded by
Mr. Pearson of the G.P.O., who
addressed the Engineering So-
ciety recently, illustrating his talk
with slides, a film, and four
crates of working models of satel-
lites.
Next Tuesday, December 3rd,
a speaker from the British Air-
craft Corporation will discuss the
design of the highly controversial
Concorde Supersonic air liner.
He will be speaking in Room 542
Mech. Eng. at a special lunch-
hour meeting.
Guilds Car
An Old Centralian has given
Guilds a 1933 Austin 8—black,
four doors, four wheels. The
number is OC 253, and it has
been on display outside Mech.
Eng. for the past week. As this
year's Carnival Charity is the
Mental Health Campaign, we
have decided to auction this mag-
nifient vehicle during to-morrow's
Union Meeting ; all the purchase
price going to the Campaign. If
would like to buy this car
—and benefit a most worthy
canse—.examine the goods, con-
sider your price, and come along

through their friends in Guilds by
proxy.

Swimming Gala
This year we are hiring Mar-
shall Street Baths in Soho.
Coaches will be leaving from
Guilds at about 6.00 p.m., and
we hope to get back by about 9.0

did a magnificent job for Guilds
in- winning the Morphy and
Lowry races on Morphy Day,
let's hope Bob Collins and his
teams will win again at the Swim-
ming Gala—^December 6th, Fri-
day.
