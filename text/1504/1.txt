the eventual year-on-year change.”
In a statement released alongside
the figures UCAS Chief Executive
Mary Curnock Cook added: “Recent
changes in HE funding mean that ap-
plication patterns this year may be
different to previous years and we
are gearing up for a possible late
surge close to the January 15 dead-
line where applicants have taken
more time to research their applica-
tions. We expect some depression of
demand due to a decline in the young
population but it is much too early to
predict any effects from changes in
tuition fees.”
In fact, the total number of appli-
cants who faced an earlier deadline
of October 15 (those applying to Ox-
bridge and all Medicine and Veteri-
nary related courses) has only fallen
by 0.8% compared to last year. The
number of UK-domiciled early dead-
line 18 year old applicants actually
rose by 1.1%, despite the population
size of that age group decreasing
slightly.
It is also perhaps unfair to compare
this year’s figures to those last year.
There was an especially large num-
ber of applicants for 2011 entry, un-
doubtedly in no small part as a result
of people wishing to avoid higher
fees. Indeed, there has only been a
2.7% drop in total applications com-
pared to figures released in Novem-
ber 2009.

Latest figures reveal further lack

applications

The gap between the number of ap-
plicants to UK universities this year
compared to last has widened. The
latest figures from the Universities
and Colleges Admissions Service
(UCAS) reveal that the number of ap-
plicants for higher education courses
has fallen by 12.9%, corresponding
to over 23,000 people, compared to
this time last year. Last month’s fig-
ures indicated a drop of only 9.0%.
This overall drop comes despite the
number of non-EU applicants, who
pay far higher fees than others but
are not affected by the government’s
higher education funding reforms,
increasing by 11.8% compared to
last year. This suggests a growing
unwillingness by prospective home
students to pay fees of up to £9,000.
The Telegraph this week reported
Liam Burns, the president of the Na-
tional Union of Students, saying that
“ministers need to take responsibil-
ity for their disastrous education re-
forms and admit that, regardless of
the final application numbers, the
behaviour of prospective students
will be affected by the huge rise in
fees.” However, Nicola Dandridge,
chief executive of Universities UK,
was reported as adding that “it’s
worth noting that applicant numbers
are currently down, not only in Eng-
land, but also in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland who do not have the
same fees system”.
A UCAS press release also reminds
that the final application deadline is
January 15 and that “application pat-
terns this far ahead of that date are
historically unreliable indicators of
