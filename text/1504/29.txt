Marilyn Monroe is without a doubt one
of the most celebrated, well-known fig-
ures of the 20th Century. My Week with
Marilyn, as its title may suggest, only
explores a brief section of the icon’s
life, but since she has accomplished
so much, even the smallest slice in her
showbiz-surrounded life is full of fun,
romance and charm which is exactly
what the film offers.
The Prince and the Showgirl, shot in
England, (in)famously united Monroe
(Michelle Williams) and Sir Laurence
Olivier (Kenneth Branagh), where the
production was plagued with delays,
miscommunication, and great discon-
tent from Olivier, as he was far from
impressed with Monroe’s notoriously
erratic behaviour on set that included
tardiness, alcoholism and drug use.
Whilst My Week with Marilyn does
focus on the filming aspect, caught in
the middle of this is in fact Colin Clark
(Eddie Redmayne), the third assistant
director, whose job is to do all the grunt
work. Captivated by Monroe even be-
fore her arrival in London, Clark’s boy-
ish enthusiasm and warm personality
bring the two close together. Trapped
in a less than satisfactory marriage to
Arthur Miller (Dougray Scott), Mon-
roe finds comfort and solace in Clark’s
arms.
Milton Greene (Dominic Cooper),
Marilyn’s business partner, warns Clark
to not get involved: “She breaks hearts,
she will break yours too.” But what
they share has very little to do with sex
or lust. It’s a strong friendship built on
trust, with the occasional moments of
passion that build up from spending so
much time together. Although there is
unavoidable tragedy lurking around the
corner, director Simon Curtis makes
sure the atmosphere is always light
enough and the breezy script supports
this. As the infatuated Colin, Redmayne
is a wholly likable central character,
with his wide-eyed, somewhat childish
fascination towards everything that is
going on around him. He is a tall, hand-
some actor with immense appeal, with
enough cheek and confidence that he
convincingly adds to his initially clue-
less character.
Success brings luxury, fame and infi-
nite love from crowds, but for a price.
The pressure she faces in Pinewood
Studios starts to build up. Despite her
acting coach Paula Strasberg’s (Zoë
Wanamaker) supportive words, Mari-
lyn finds her confidence shaken every
time she stumbles on a line, further
infuriating the already heated Olivier.
Dame Sybil Thorndike (Judi Dench), is
more understanding, and as a woman of
principle and disciplined manner, she
exudes warmth as well as firm maternal
presence to anyone who unreasonably
crosses the line.
No words can describe just how su-
perb Williams is in the role of Mon-
roe. She has the looks, the voice, the
swagger, and the sassiness, but there
is something so much more to her por-
trayal than what is visible on the sur-
face. The behind-the-scenes Marilyn,
the insecure, vulnerable and troubled
superstar longing to be taken seriously,
to be loved, and not quite ready to cope
with all the uncomfortable sides the
glitzy Hollywood life brings with it,
Williams makes sure that Monroe is a
human being after all, and that she is
someone worth caring about. But she’s
not all about the depressed Marilyn, as
when her character gets her vibrant en-
ergy, she is delightfully glamorous.
As for the invaluable supporting play-
ers, Cooper’s wonky American accent
aside, everyone stands strong in their
roles, with two of the greatest English
actors, Branagh and Dench, living up to
their usual high standards. Wanamaker,
as Marilyn’s coach who wants what
is best for her most talented student,
is stubborn and relentless, clashing
with Olivier regarding Marilyn’s act-
ing style. She believes in method act-
ing, he doesn’t. Emma Watson, in her
first post-Potter role, has an interesting
role of Colin’s could-be girlfriend, and
the two share a warm enough chemis-
try to show the audience a glimpse of
possibility that Colin may be better
off settling down for someone more to
his standard. Although looking noth-
ing like the wife of Laurence Olivier,
Julia Ormond does an admirable job as
Vivien Leigh, in a crucial scene that she
hints at her jealousy towards the much
younger, sought-after Marilyn.
It’s a light trek that gives us plenty
of insight into the complicated life of
Marilyn Monroe. We will never know
the full extent of just how frightened
she was of failing those around her,
and just how lonely and isolated she
must have felt. The film tries to show as
many variations as possible, which can
lead to quite a few repetitions. Marilyn
is troubled, she calls for Colin’s help,
he comes, calms her down, and she
feels better. It’s a routine that is both
predictable and slightly tiresome after
a while, but it’s a film to watch simply
for the flawless performances. Nomi-
nations should be flooding in towards
the end of this year for Williams, and
rightly so.
