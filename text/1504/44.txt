Imperial’s team of elite and not so elite
judokas trekked to the edge of civilisa-
tion last Saturday, to the point where
electricity is limited to 4 hours a day and
counting to six on one hand gets easy. It
was time for the London Open Champi-
onships in Uxbridge and the second big-
gest competition on the judo calendar.
Despite the 5:00 am start, Imperial
was in high spirits after collecting 9
medals this time last year, a feat that
everyone was hoping to better now that
our ranks included a high number of
beginners who had come through our
dedicated beginners’ course and were
entering the category specifically for
those who have started judo this year.
We practically ran towards the dreaded
weighing scales to be informed if 3
weeks of dieting and the self-torture of
abstinence from drinking had paid off.
All made it and could finally eat some
breakfast apart from one fresher who
was so confused about not making his
weight category...until he remembered
the Pizza Hut All-You-Can Eat eating
competition he’d had the night before.
Gabriel, shame on you.
Fresher’s and advanced players alike,
Imperial put on an impressive display
of foot sweeps, shoulder throws, drop
throws and strangles to beat their way
to 6 finals and 8 semi-finals. Spectac-
ular fights included several Imperial
friendly fire situations, notably Thanos
who beat 3 other Imperial players to
claim a bronze medal and Thore Buck-
ing who beat not only everyone in his
own weight category but everyone in
the category above! One of our black
belts was even awarded “Fastest Throw
of the Day” winning a fight in just 5
seconds!
Going into the final fight of the com-
petition was Imperial Dan grade (black
belt) Jusso, Imperial and Brunel Uni-
versity were neck and neck for overall
points scored, if Jusso won his last fight
not only would he win the team’s 4th
gold medal but Imperial would win the
competition overall. 2 minutes of nail-
biting judo and Imperial lay the smack
down with a flawless throw that saw
his opponent’s feet flying higher than
his head before crashing into the mat.
Imperial win the fight and the champi-
onship.
Total competition hoard: 4 gold, 2 sil-
ver and 8 bronze medals and one mas-
sive shiny team championship trophy.
Roll on BUCS.
