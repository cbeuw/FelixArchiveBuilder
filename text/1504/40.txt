Hockey: Men’s 3rds with
1st win of the season
versus Sussex
To say that it has been a disastrous start
to the season would be an understate-
ment for the IC Hockey Men’s 3rd XI.
By losing their first four games they
had already lost more times this season
than in the entirety of the last. With rel-
egation a shocking possibility, the team
knew that they needed to register a win
soon, which is exactly what they did
against a shell-shocked Sussex 2nd XI.
Playing 4-4-2 with a diamond had
not been working for IC who have been
lacking an attacking edge all season.
So with drastic times calling for drastic
measures, the team changed to a 4-3-
3 and within minutes of the push back
this change almost reaped immediate
rewards with SCID almost knocking in
a loose ball but for good work by the
Sussex keeper.
IC kept up this pressure throughout
the first 10 minutes of the half, but after
this period, the game started to turn. A
break by Sussex into our D saw goal-
keeper Sifter run out to make a fine
goal-saving tackle, but severely injure
his neck in the process.
After a lengthy injury time out, IC
took too long to get back into the game
and found themselves a goal down
when the Sussex forward snuck in be-
hind the otherwise excellent Eager Bea-
ver and Fritzl to slot coolly past a help-
less Sifter. Some more poor play from
IC offered Sussex plenty of opportuni-
ties, but thankfully poor finishing kept
the score at just 1-0 when going into
half time.
An inspiring half-time team talk from
Sifter rallied the troops, reminding the
team to play simple hockey and show
that they were better than their Sussex
opposition. This, combined with the
thought of losing all of the first five
games of the season and the exuberant
support of the Ladies 2s, saw IC push
hard from the off in the second half.
Everything just seemed the click af-
ter half time. The midfield dynamo of
Fresher Hemal, Designer V, and Aqua-
man dominated the opposition, leaving
Cockerel, Fresher Ed, Pappity-Boopity-
Popitty and Munter Gatherer to exploit
the spaces behind the defence and pro-
vide golden opportunities for SCID.
It didn’t take IC long to draw level,
when a surging run down the right by
Cockerel found the stick of Designer V
who laid the ball on a plate for SCID to
finish off. With that equaliser going in,
IC were very much on top, and had Sus-
sex reeling. Wave after wave of IC at-
tack failed to produce a goal until Bum
Tablet caught one of Sussex forwards
napping while on the ball, and produced
a scintillating run, fluking his way past
two defenders before getting barged
off the ball and winning a short corner.
From the resulting short, Fresher Hemal
smashed the ball into the goal putting IC
ahead.
Sussex were stunned and try as they
could, they failed to muster much of a
response with the IC defence pushing
up high and snuffing out attacks before
they could develop. It was a nervy end
to the match though, as Sussex were
awarded a short at the death but Gingy-
pops stood up to the test and pressured
the Sussex forward into a mistake.
2-1 the final score and a thoroughly
deserved win for the Men’s 3s who hope
to extend this one match winning streak
against the RSM next week.
The medal-winning Imperial judokas pose for the camera, with smiles all around. Of course, they could kill you
in the blink of an eye
