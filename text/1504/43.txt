Sport Editor
As we roll into December, the Captains’
interviews just keep on coming! This
week, we have one of the quirkier Impe-
rial sports on display: Dodgeball. Alan
Soltani, a 3rd year physicist and Dodge-
ball club captain, is the man of the hour.
We meet up in Beit quad to talk about
balls, wrenches and more.
I’m not quite sure what to expect com-
ing into the interview – what would the
‘dodgeball type’ be? Very friendly, as
it turns out. I kick things off by asking
a bit about the structure and organisa-
tion of the club, and where Alan fits in.
“I’m club captain, as well as being first
team captain – we also have a president
though. My role involves organising
the competitive side of the club, the
matches, coaching and training.” How
many teams do Dodgeball have? “This
year, we’ve got three teams, which is the
most we’ve ever had. Teams are mixed,
with the game played six-a-side. We
took twenty-one people to the university
championships a few weeks ago.”
As I don’t remember anyone from
dodgeball sending in a report about that,
I ask him to tell me more: “There were
thirty teams competing at Cranfield uni-
versity, in the ‘experienced’ teams cat-
egory. The first team did pretty well,
getting to the quarter finals and losing
to eventual winners Warwick – who are
one of the strongest teams in the coun-
try.” Promising stuff, I think.
So what is the competition structure
for the sport? “ The UK dodgeball teams
are divided into leagues of eight teams,
with the Premiership being the top one.
We’re in the league below that, but we
haven’t played any of our matches yet,
our first fixtures are this Saturday. One
thing to point out is that the leagues
aren’t run by BUCS: there is a mix of
university and non-university teams.”
What are the team’s objectives for the
season, I ask. After your result at the
championships, are you the favourites to
get promoted? “We weren’t at the start
of the season, but we have beaten some
premier league teams in warm-up open
tournaments and people have started to
take notice. Hopefully we can keep play-
ing like this and go up.”
I’m curious about the club’s history –
surely it was founded pretty recently?
“When I joined as a fresher, in 2009,
the club was in its second year of ex-
istence. As far as I know it was formed
by a group of medics who aren’t here
any more…but the club has continued.”
How was the fresher intake for this year?
“Really solid. We started having training
sessions in Ethos just this year, before
that we would use the Union concert hall
– which is surprisingly good for dodge-
ball. Training at Ethos makes it easier to
draw in newcomers or people who want
to give it a go, though, and I’d say we
have about 35-40 people per training
session.”
Do they have official dodgeball balls
and everything? “Yeah, of course! It’s
not rubber, actually, but inflatable with
a soft outside layer.” He shows me one,
and what immediately comes to mind is
a Volleyball, but a bit lighter and slightly
padded. Alan tells me it’s soft enough
that head shots are allowed…perhaps
with a bit too much of a grin on his face.
Now for the serious stuff: how did he
get into Dodgeball? “actually, when I
was at school, I used to watch this pro-
gramme called Extreme Dodgeball that
was on Sky. It just followed a bunch
of American players around, and intro-
duced the world of dodgeball, but it was
awesome! When I got to uni and saw
the dodgeball stand at fresher’s fair, I
thought ‘I’ll give it a go’, and then just
ended up loving it.”
It seems to be a recurring theme, this,
of people picking up a sport at univer-
sity and becoming the captain a few
years down the line…So how easy is it
to progress at dodgeball? What skills are
needed? “It’s essentially a throwing and
catching game, and those are the things
you need to work on – along with speed,
reflexes, that sort of thing. It’s pretty
easy to progress rapidly, if you’re shown
what to do. We [the people who joined at
the same time as Alan - Ed.] took ages to
progress, though, because at first we had
no idea what we were doing, and no-one
was really there to show us the ropes.
The new lot are picking it up really
quickly as they have us to teach them.”
Finally, the question I have to ask:
was DodgeBall, the film a blessing or a
curse for the sport? “ Definitely a bless-
ing. UK dodgeball didn’t kick off until
the film came out – there was a guy in
Leicester who saw the film, thought ‘this
is wicked’ and started the UK dodgeball
association”.
To be very honest, most people had a
bit of a laugh when I told them I’d be
interviewing the dodgeball captain. I
tell Alan this, and he concurs. It’s not
always the easiest sport to admit to
playing seriously. “ I’ve had quite a bit
of stick over the years, especially when
you say you play dodgeball competi-
tively…but I’m used to it!” As the great
Patches O’Houlihan once said, “If you
can dodge a wrench, you can dodge a
ball.” You just have to be prepared to
take some stick for it.
