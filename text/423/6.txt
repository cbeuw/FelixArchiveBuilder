Music
Essentially
a live sport
Rory Gallagher: The Story So Far
T H E R E A R E at present two albums on
release by Polydor featuring complications
from previous albums by Rory G a l l a g h e r .
One is originally titled " R O R Y
G A L L A G H E R " in the " S P E C I A L " series
and one c a l l e d " T H E S T O R Y SO F A R " .
Having listened to the latter I decided
that his style of music is loud and
exciting (as opposed to the tedium of
Sabbath's e x c e s s i v e volume).
The sleeve notes c l a i m that he has
established himself as one of the
world's top blues artists, this I do not
doubt if the tracks on this album are
representative of his general quality.
The album conveys the atmosphere of a
live concert into my small room, no
little feat considering my system, and
since blues is e s s e n t i a l l y a live sport,
T h i s album succeeds where others have
f a i l e d .
Flappers Unite!
B U D G I E ' S latest assault on the central
nervous system has the amazing title of
"If I were Briltania I'd waive the Rules,"
A p r e c i s e l y produced album designed to
inflict brain damage on a l l within fifty
yards of the speakers. T h i s effect, of
course, is only obtained with the volume
on f u l l , but who would dream of playing
Budgie quietly??? Burke S h e l l e y ' s
vocals have now lost their " p l a n t - l i k e "
q u a l i t i e s , and the incessant beat no
longer sounds like a Sabbath reject —
they are now starring in their own right.
A s always they have the Budgie
subtle bit, two t r a c k s : one c a l l e d "Heaven
Knows Our Name" and one c a l l e d
"Black Velvet Stallion". B o t h are
excellent pieces showing more imagin-
ation than the other tracks. Budgie are
definitely progressing and show even
greater promise for the future...Love to
a l l the little f i s h e s !

Transcended with vitality-
Jazz-rock barrier
Shamal - Gong
S H O R T O F T H E one small symbol inside
the cover, Gong have now left the
concepts of the "Planet Gong" far
behind. T h e y have a l s o replaced three»
inventive musicians with one v i o l i n i s t ,
a change in musical direction that seemed
to s p e l l disaster, but which has, instead
of destroying them, sent them into yet
unheard of realms of creativity.
Although two of the tracks s t i l l
feature Steve H i l l age and Miquette
Giraudy, the change in style is obvious
Theatre
and eminently p l e a s i n g . The most notable
track " B a m b o o j i " features H i l l a g e and
extensive flutework by Didier Malherbe
and sounds like a Himalayan shepherds
love song. The p e r c u s s i o n , as u s u a l ,
has a large part to play in the album,
ranging from b e l l s to vibes and gongs.
In general, Gong seem to be tran-
scending the J a z z - R o c k barrier with new
vitality, the only disappointment being
that Howlett's voice i s not as forceful 1
nor distinctive as Daevid A l l e n ' s or
Steve H i l l a g e ' s .
D A P P L E T O N
Theatre round-up
O F T H E T W E N T Y odd plays that I have
seen in the past eight months in London,
fifteen are s t i l l running and can be seen
whilst you are recovering from your exams
during the next fortnight. C o n v a l e s c e n c e
from examinitis is, of course, not
compulsory for the enjoyment of live
theatre, and I w i l l certainly continue to
report on the theatre in any editions of
F E L I X published through the summer.
F i r s t l y there is the National Theatre
on the South Bank. If you can bare to
queue early in the morning the box office
opens at 8.30am to s e l l seats at £1 or
50p for that d a y ' s performances. The
plays in the current repertoire are a pretty
mixed bunch. Hamlet is fairly tedious -
Albert Finney is twenty years too old and
the production is far too long. The
Playboy of the Western World is great
fun — full of enthusiasm and a great
pleasure to watch. Plunder is another
joy to s e e . Dinsdale Landen plays the
delightful s i l l y a s s part with perfect
timing. Watch It Come Down is the new
Osborne play, if you like to see married
couples tearing each other to bits then
this is the play for you (alternatively you
could try sitting in front of a television).
At the Albery, the N a t i o n a l ' s
production of Peter Shaffer's Equus is a
must. C o l i n B l a k e l y gives a compelling
performance as the child psychiatrist
trying to come to terms with his marriage
whilst treating a juvenile deliquent who
has committed a particularly unpleasant
crime. T h i s is a very well constructed
play and is well worth a v i s i t . Another
very theatrical play is Athol Fugard's
Dimetos at the Comedy. The pleasure of
hearing Paul Scofield speaking such
poetic lines is immense. Those of you
whose interests lie in the field of levers
and pulleys might be pleasantly surprised
by Mr S c o f i e l d ' s exposition on the
subject.
(Tom Stoppard's Dirty Linen (which
opens at the Arts Theatre C l u b on June
16th) is a glorious romp around a
committee room of the House of Commons
— compulsory viewing f a all stoppard
fans. Otherwise Engaged is s t i l l at the
Queen's although A l a n Bates has left
the part created for him by Simon Gray. If
you know what it is like to be unable
to play a new L P as a s u c c e s s i o n of
friends drop round for coffee you might
enjoy this.
When it comes to Mike Stott's Funny
Peculiar at the Garrick, I am lost for
words. C l e v e r though the play is, I found
it unnecessarily crude though most of the
audience seemed to be having the
funniest time of their l i v e s . Joan
Plowright is s t i l l in the latest Ben
Travers farce at the L y r i c . Perhaps Mr
Stoot could learn a few things from Mr
Travers (90 years old and s t i l l going
strong). In The Bed Before Yesterday,
Miss Plowright plays the widow s t i l l
recovering from the shock of her wedding
night so many years before.
There are certain types o f . p l a y s that
have little appeal to me. I think it w i l l
have become obvious to you during the
past year which those are and I leave it
to you to find them out. I suspect that
O ' N e i l l ' s The Iceman Cometh would have
come into this category. It wasn't
reviewed on. this page because i l l n e s s
in the cast prevented its opening.
