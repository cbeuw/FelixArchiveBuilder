Belles with balls!
Cado Belle in concert at the Red Cow in Hammersmith
I ' V E S E E N this band perform on no less
than eight o c c a s i o n s during the j a s t
three months. I was knocked out the first
time I heared them, but amazingly they
seem to improve with every g i g . L a s t week
at the R e d C o w in Hammersmith Road
they pulled off one of the best gigs
I've seen in many a long day.
T h e r e ' s no real doubt about it, if
good music still counts for anything
these days, then Cado B e l l e w i l l make
some impact — things are beginning to
happen for the band at last. T h e y ' v e
just signed a lucrative contract with
Anchor Records, with just about every
other major record company clammering
for them to put their name on the dotted
line.
The six-piece band hail from G l a s g o w ,
that seemingly endless cauldron of raw
talent. They feature the sure s a x and
and flute of C o l i n T u l l y the original
guitar playing of A l a n Darby, the tight-
arse drumming of Davy R o y , the subtle
keyboard work of Stuart M c K i l l o p , the
fine singing of Maggie R e i l l y and the
brilliance of bass player G a v i n Hodgson.
By pure definition they could best be
described a s a funk band, using strong
melodic songs that are as intellegently
written a s they are tightly performed.
They owe very little to the soul orientated
style of their fellow countrymen, the
Average White Band; Cado B e l l e ' s music
being more structurally defined, only the
the foundation of the songs being anywhere
near soul based.
The opening number is always " T i c k
T o c k " , an instrumental that sets the
pattern for just about everything they
do. They play so tightly that they put
just about every other outfit playing the
pub circuit to total shame. Then comes
"Airport Shutdown", a well structured
song with L a t i n overtones. It gives the
first opportunity for singer, Maggie R e i l l y ,
to show off her extensive v o c a l range.
The song has a light air to it, with
T u l l y switching to flute and M c K i l l o p
using string synthesiser. T h e intra of
" G o / to Love" has only the slightest
leaning towards the A W B and the band
are back into their tight, funky groove.
Throughout the set, the band demon-
strated the maturity of their writing,
from the ultra-funk of "Next Best Thing"
to "Stone's Throw from Nowhere",
a b a l l a d that reeks of sheer c l a s s . A n
instrumental, "E ill", is the only song
that sounds slightly out of context with
the rest of the set. P l a y e d in unison of
a frightening pace by T u l l y and Darby,
it perhaps owes more to the music of
say, the E l e v e n t h H o u s e , before coming
towards the end when it slows down and
Maggie comes in with some fine scat
singing, taking it back into the Cado
B e l l e mould. The band end with the
rousing "Still Running", the song having
a slight resemblance to Kokomo's end of
set number, " / can understand it", with
the e x c e l l e n t guitarist Darby pulling off
an extraordinary extended guitar s o l o , the
song guaranteed to bring any house
down.
If taken in the right context, this
band is already as good a s Kokomo
were at their best, and if handled by the
right producer, Cado B e l l e could have a
debut album on their hands to equal
A W B ' s first Atlantic recording. See this
band now, when its cheap.

The G-band in concert at Hastings
Pier Pavilion
T H E L A S T E n t s concert of this year
takes p l a c e in the Great H a l l next
Saturday, 19th June. T h e G - B a n d
(formerly the Glitter B a n d — even minus
the " l i t t e r " they don't seemed to have
improved) w i l l be performing. Hopefully
a couple of hundred screaming little girls
w i l l turn up, otherwise this concert
could be a financial disaster. However,
E n t s Chairman, Andy Higman, s a y s that
they have s o l d more advanced tickets at
this stage than for any other concert.
At H a s t i n g s , most of the audience
seemed intent o n enjoying themselves
whatever happened. T h e result w a s 400
drunken boppers leaping about, a
minority of whom fainted in front of the
stage, screaming, crying, e t c . T h e most
disturbing point concerning the concert
was that the band ran out of songs after
an hour. However, if you're s t i l l around
next Saturday, get drunk, go along,
laugh, scream and sob!
