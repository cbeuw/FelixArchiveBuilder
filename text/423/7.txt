reduce the pace to that more
suited to a hot Sunday

A C O M B I N A T I O N of hard
training and a fast flat course
helped the whole IC c r o s s -
country team break the s i x
minute miling barrier in the
Fleet 4 mile road race last
Saturday, and t w o of the
team broke the five minute
miling barrier.
T h i s race w a s chosen for
its lack of c l a s s and distinct
medal prospects, but hopes
were gradually shattered a s
more and more experienced
club road runners turned up,
all obviously attracted by the
p o s s i b i l i t y of a pot hunt.
The IC team was lead home
as usual,by Rob (Braunschultz)
A l l i n s o n , still recovering from
traumatic experiences in the
Faversham 17km race on Whit
Monday. H i s time of 19.08 put
him into 23rd position, just
behind the main bunch. In
last years race this time would
have seen him in 6th position!

However, strong batting

The medics found t h e m s e l v e s

deliveries during their innings.
Two early wickets by Jeffs
had the medics reel ling and IC
kept up the pressure for the
rest of the game.
F i v e w i c k e t s , two from
Cowan and three from Pember-
ton, brought IC within sight of
victory. B u t despite heavy
pressure the last wicket
remained intact. So IC 2nd's

T H E IC opening pair of' Tom
Ghosh and R o b Young roared
off with a fine stand of 110
before Ghosh w a s caught for
69. H i s partner went on to make
43 before he w a s d i s m i s s e d

were then s e t the task of
scoring some quick runs. In
doing this many wickets were
given away and the last IC
batsman w a s d i s m i s s e d soon
after tea with the total at 141.
At this point a draw seemed
likely and this w a s indeed
the final result. Three w i c k e t s

Merton were made to fight but
