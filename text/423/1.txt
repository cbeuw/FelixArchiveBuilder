Singleton scoring IC's only
goal of the match
DAME ALICE OWEN'S Playing Fields at Whetstone,
North London, provided the unlikely setting for a practice
match between IC and an England XI on Wednesday
afternoon. Despite getting lost, the IC squad arrived
before the England team.
According to England
Manager, D o n R e v i e , this
match w a s to form the b a s i s
from which he would choose
his five substitutes for
England C u p qualifying
match against F i n l a n d i n
H e l s i n k i this Sunday.
The match which lasted
only an hour w a s meant a s a
dummy game in which the I C
team took on the role of the
defensive F i n n i s h side. In a
pre-match prep talk, D o n
Revie asked the I C team to
play a tight game and use
man-for-man marking with a
sweeper at the back. The result
of I C employing these t a c t i c s ,
in the first half, meant that
England scored only eight
goals — die first of which
came after only three minutes
of play.
In one of their numerous
attacks, I C managed to
salvage a goal towards the
end of the first half. T h e
goal came after I C had forced
a throw-in on the right; Mike
Doyle headed out, but I C
C a p t a i n , J i m Iley put the b a l l
back i n — it was f l i c k e d on
by P a t Frampton to P h i l
Singleton who turned o n the
"Good work-out for the
boys"-Revie
b a l l and pushed it under the
advancing body of J o e Corrigan.
A s k e d to modify their game
slightly i n the second naif,
I C lifted their play and this
produced a much tighter
game. With l e s s room to
manoeuvre i n , England found
themselves being forced back
and Corrigan had to make a few
saves to keep I G out.
E n g l a n d ' s domination of
the midfield w a s somewhat
reduced with the substitution
of Mick Popper with Steve
B a t e s . I C ventured out more
p o s i t i v e l y during the middle
of this half and i n one the
more vigorous encounters,
Tony Towers h a d to leave the
field for several minutes with
a wrenched right foot after
being involved i n a tackle
with Ian Huntingdon.
Despite I C ' s improved
play i n the second half,
E n g l a n d scored five more
goals to run out winners by
13 goals to 1.
