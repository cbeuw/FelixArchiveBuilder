Middle East Comment
T H E I S R A E L I government attracts
criticism when it
(a) rejects P a l e s t i n i a n Liberation
Organisation ( P L O ) talk o f a " s e c u l a r ,
democratic state i n P a l e s t i n e " e t c and
(b) i s s c e p t i c a l of a solution to the Arab
P a l e s t i n i a n problem outside the context
of Jordan.
I would like to show that this position
does merit at l e a s t some sympathy,
e s p e c i a l l y with regard to point (a).
Consider L e b a n o n , a good up-to-date
example of a n opportunity to implement
the principles of a " d e m o c r a t i c , secular
secular s t a t e . " Despite the fact that
Lebanon used to be held up a s an
example in the Arab world (the only one!)
where two very large religious groups
could c o e x i s t with reasonable freedom,
L e b a n o n ' s political edifice has stood on
fragile foundations for much of the time
since its complete independence from
Syria in 1944, and we have no arrived
at the point where the o l d balance of
forces has completely broken down,
not without P L O connivance.
But even before the tragic events of
the last few months it w a s still a fact
of L e b a n e s e p o l i t i c a l life that the
religious background of an individual
played a major role in h i s appointment to
any public post or position of power.
Now, why should this be s o ? T h e answer
is that there just are no fully secular
states in the Middle East. T h i s fact i s
neither good nor bad; it just i s and h a s
to be recognised as s u c h .
In Lebanon we graphically see Arabs
of a l l kinds k i l l i n g other Arabs of a l l
kinds and little or no talk of a " s e c u l a r ,
democratic s t a t e . "
For d i s c u s s i o n of (b) I would like to
consider the pre-1967 border between
Israel and Jordan, when the West Bank
also came under the sovereignty of
K i n g H u s s e i n . T h e n , the majority of
Arab P a l e s t i n i a n s in the Middle E a s t
lived i n Jordan, and the majority of
Jordanian c i t i z e n s were P a l e s t i n i a n .
Therefore it would not be unreasonable to
think of this as a P a l e s t i n i a n state. But
K i n g H u s s e i n i s not a P a l e s t i n i a n , and
so if his government i s not representative
of P a l e s t i n i a n w i s h e s , a case c a n be
made out that this w a s an internal
Jordanian problem, and that H u s s e i n and
his group perhpas should not be in power.
If Israel were to return Judaua and
Samaria (the occupied West Bank) to
Jordan, there would i n fact be a return to
a situation that existed for the twenty
years after the 1947 U N partition plan
w h i c h had" provided for the creation of
a separate Arab P a l e s t i n i a n state. It
seems that while the West Barik w a s
under Jordanian rule few people (except
perhaps some P a l e s t i n i a n s ) believed in
the justice of an 'autonomous or
independent Arab P a l e s t i n i a n state. B u t
things have changed and more people
subscribe to this point of v i e w , and it
can be argued, rightly or wrongly, that a
large P a l e s t i n i a n Arab entity on the pre-
1967 territory of Jordon in place of the
J u s s e i n regime would be a more viable
and stable state than a s m a l l one squeezed
between Israel and an E a s t B a n k Jordan.
I have been somewhat brief and
chosen only two aspects of a very complex
question. O f course the Israeli government
i s not always right, nevertheless I have
endeavoured to indicate that its foreign
p o l i c i e s have been formulated in the
context of Middle East p o l i t i c s a n d on
b a s i s of bitter historical l e s s o n s , and
therefore never merit wholesale
condemnation.
