MORPHY DAY

followed by a later t r a i n and had a Ran-
ge11a In the station, A Guildaman who
squealed "R.C.S." i n a high falsetto
Toioe was hotly pursued: on Being caught
he was forced to say "R.C.S," i n a more
respectful tone.
B.C.S. mored slowly up Exhibition
Road, disrupting the t r a f f i c and mal-
treating passing cars. Guildsmen were
waiting f o r any continuation of the hat-
t i e , but after a few exchanges R.C.S.
departed. The Guildsmen were by this time
stopping and inspecting every car that
passed. An irate owner 'phoned the Police,
who duly arrived in yet another Black
Maria, with a dog. The heavens opened
upon them, and two plain-clothes men
grabbed a pair of Cuildsmen, who were
saying "miaow, miaow, puss, puss" to the
dog. One of them foolishly tried to re-
s i s t and received a rough treatment f o r
his pains. In an interview with our re-
porter, the Inspector said that the two
men had been arrested "for using insult-
ing behaviour by which a breach of the
peace may have been occasioned?
Two constables, without a warrant,
entered Guilds to t r y to prevent the
showers, but they were misguided enough'
to ask a Cuildsman the way to the roof;
they were not seen f o r some considerable
time.
On hearing of the arrests, the
Rector seemed unperturbed and expres-
sed optimism.
The views expressed i n FELIX are
those of the individual writers, and
the E d i t o r i a l Board w i l l not be held
responsible.
SNOGGING
Sear S i r ,
Since the opening of the new Union
building, I have observed a steady i n -
crease i n the ttuantity of snogging that
tames place on these premises, especial-
l y i n the lower lounge. I t i s extremely
disconcerting to glance over the top of
my FELIX and f i n d a b l i s s f u l pair of
cooing doves. I t does not make jaa feel
b l i s s f u l . On the contrary, i t arouses
my i r e .
However, at least half of each
couple i s generally a Union member, and
r e a l l y we ought to eater f o r a l l Union
a c t i v i t i e s . Surely some l i t t l n room
could be set aside for this purpose. The
FELIX room, f o r example, would be ideal.
I t would give you. S i r , something to
write about, and relieve me, S i r , from
the prospect of a spectacle whioh has
nothing on bull-fighting.
I am,
your oppressed servant,
L.J.Horner,
We apologise to the Presidsnt for
referring to h i s instrument as s tuba.
I t i s , i n fact, an euphonium.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
B O O N T H E G O
S i r ,
In the last two issues of FELIX i t
has been stated that Boanerges was not
present at either of the Freshers' days.
This i s not sot 'Bo' was present on both
occasions. What actually happened was
that 'Bo' was not allowed to proceed
under his own power because he wasn't
taxed; That he was i n good condition
was demonstrated when he was manoeuvered
under power i n the car park adjacent to
the Roderie H i l l Building.
Farther, the statement that Bo' was
causing worry i s misleading; he was
overhauled prior to the Brighton Run on
Nov, 3rd.
Tours etc.

Following so soon sJJfer your last view-
point I thought perhaps I was seeing things
when, attending Hall Dinner last week I
saw several 'gentlemen', also at that
function, wearing sports jackets and
flannels.
However, perhaps one may hope they
were freshers who w i l l know better i n fut-
ure - unlike the more senior student who
came into dinner smoking a cigarette.
Surely I.C. can set a high standard
for formal occasions as well as i n other
f i e l d s .
Yours f a i t h f u l l y ,
Bob Browning.
BEER
Dear S i r
I t i s the considered opinion of us,
the undersigned, that the condition of
ths draught beer sold i n the Union Bar
leaves much to be desired.
Cannot something be done about this?

I t i s , or should be, the
policy of I.C. Union to welcome the form-
ation of new olubs and societies within
i t s aegis, with the proviso that ths aim
of such olubs i s to carry out a function
i n some facet of College l i f e f o r whioh
existing clubs and societies do not oster.
I f a i l to espy any such aim i n ths
proposed Church Society mentioned i n your
last issue. Surely the provision of a
"meeting ground for members of the Church
of England, and other members of the Ang-
l i c a n Communion, and anyone elss who
wishes to ssk questions or j o i n diaous-
sion", to quote Mr Evans, i s adequately
made by the already existing I.C. branch
of the S.CM. and ths I.C.C.U. W i l l not
ths formation of this "Church Society"
tend to s p l i t even mors tha* at present
the existing Christian soo» ties within
ths College?
Tours i n doubt,

Dear Editor,
With regard to the remarks made at
the R.C.S. Union meeting on Thurs. Oct.
31st. concerning the "respectability
of i t s members" we recommend that the
Geology department - i n particular the
barbarlo 2nd. year-- should be transferred
to the R.S.M. Union, their natural hab-
i t a t .
Yours hopefully,
Botany 2.
BILLIARDS
Dear S i r ,
Is i t generally known that the b i l l -
iard tables are monopolised by a certain
clique, which includes members of the
B i l l i a r d s Club committee?
Block bookings are made i n advance f o r
which numerous names and pens are used.
Relays are organised to ensure that
they keep the table during the lunch hour.
We do not wish to make any observations
on this situation, we only believe that i t
should be brought to the general notice
and are prepared to answer personally f o r
the above statements.
We wish to remain your obedient servants,
R.G.E. Hodgson.
W.A.J. White.
