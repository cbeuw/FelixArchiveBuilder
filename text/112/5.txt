UNION CARDS
It has become increasingly apparent
in the year that the Hew Union Building
has been i n f u l l operation that many
members of the Public, not members of the
Union, have been taking advantage of the
f a c i l i t i e s offered i n the building and the
cheap meals available i n the Refectories.
Many people have been introduced as
guests to the building either by members
or i n other circumstances and unfortunately
some of them tend to assume f u l l member-
ship and a l l that i t entitles members to
use. I t i s with some reluctance that the
Executive Committee of the Union has
deelded that i n accordance with the House
Committee report passed at the Union
General Meeting i n Sumner 1957 i t may be
necessary to have an occasional check on
Union cards to deter these people from
using the building.
As members of the Union w i l l appreciate
the numbers are so great that i t i s imposs-
ible for o f f i c i a l s to recognise a l l people
entitled to use the building and so to
avoid any d i f f i c u l t or embarrassing s i t -
uations we ask for your co-operation i n
this step and ask you to carry your Union
cards when entering the Union building.
It w i l l be endeavoured to reduce to a
minimum any inconvenience that may result.

Many complaints have been received
at the Imperial College Union office
from psople who have not received
their Union Cards. Members are
advised to contact their constituent
oollege union secretaries through college
racks at the earliest opportunity.
Union Cards would obviously be use-
f u l at the sale of Hop tickets on Sat-
urday evenings. The Entertainments Com-
mittee cannot give Union members pre-
ference over outsiders for the few
tickets that are available at the door
on Saturday evenings i f there i s no
means of distinguishing them, i f a l l
Union members carry their cards they
can be given preference, so eliminating
many of the complaints that are receiv-
ed each week.
CH£SS CLUB
The Chess Club started i t s activities
this session with freshers' t r i a l s . These
were highly successful and the club has
now got many new strong players. The l s t .
team has already scored i t ' s f i r s t victory
&
4
-
J vs. St. Barts. Medical School. The
'A' team drew i t s f i r s t match vs. Worcester
Union, a strong team of blind players, and
followed this up by winning It's fixture
against Lensbury by 8 points to 2.
The lower teams did not start off well.
Ths third team lost 3jr§ to U.C.H. and the
second team travelled a l l the way to the
Mile End Road for a fixture vs. Q.M.C. only
to find that there was no team waiting for
them, this being duo to the Secretary's
one sided argument with a Jaguar.
The club i s organising i t s championships
i n ths form of a Swiss tournament for ths
f i r s t tins this ssssion. The number of
participants i s high and after the f i r s t
round there have already been a large
number of surprises.

Scots and Sootophiles are invited to a
short meeting on Wednesday, November 13th.
at 6 p.m. i n Council Room 1 at U.L.U., i n
order to form a L.U. Scottish Society,
which w i l l meet twice or three times per
term.
A l l unable to attend please contact
J. Brand at L.S.E. or J. Danbe at the
Institute of Education as soon as possible.
With the large membership of both the
Chess and Bridge clubs, the Chess and
Bridge room i s extremely orowded during
ths lunch hour and although there are
plenty of sets for anyone who wants to
play there i s often nowhere to put the
board. This, coupled with ths Bridge
players' continuous violent discussion
as to whioh of ths partners vas at fault
after a given hand has lsd many mrsibers
of ths sluh to wonder i f there i s any
p o s s i b i l i t y of obtaining separate accom-
modation f o r the two clubs.
NELSON observed that the scrolls
presented to the Honorary Fallows
on Commemoration Day were passed
from an OUT box, whioh seems
rather appropriate.
It must have been nice for Prof.
Levy to have been made an Honor-
ary Fellow i n the presence of the
chairman of one of the biggest
capitalist concerns In the coun-
try.
One of our f a i r Iowarians was
being rowed on the Serpentine
by a stalwart R.C.S. man. The
inevitable happened and she

wasn't t i l l Wednesday.
Nelson congratulates a l l those
fresh I.C. women who got t o
Commem. B a l l - i t ' s more than he
did.
After the B a l l at Claridges a
voice was heard to enquire how
much i t oost to stay the night.
The reply apparently extinguished
the voice — i t wasn't heard again.
W i l l Ian Charles Robertson please
collect his cutlery from the
Refect cry.
Initiative suppressed again'. In an
effort to brighten up their rooms
i n the Careen Hostel, three of i t s
inhabitants borrowed a few of tha
contractors' signs that have been
lying around. They were pounced
upon by the Warden, however, and
are now the recipients of a b i l l
for £55-10-0.
