N O E L I N E C O t V G l L L
The President of I.C.W.S.C. was horn
i n Bradford and now U r e a i n Pudaey. Her
early l i f e was spent i n the comparative
obscurity of a g i r l s * school. When we
asked her why she deoided to read
Aeronautics she replied that,she was
interested i n aeroplanes. We refused
to believe t h i s . When she arrived at I.C
•he israediately impressed everyone with
her personality and has been doing this
ever since. She i s a great believer i n
further education for women ( see photo
above ).
She likes classical piano music,
theatre and cinema (as an art form),
hookey and squash, and Is p a r t i a l to
a l i t t l e sport.
She dislikes 10-5 men(and women),
drunken engineers singing "The Engineer"
and shouting "Spaghetti" i n the quad.,
and communal eating;.
She i s secretary of Phoenix and
secretary of mixed Hookey: one wonders
why she d i d not go to the London
College of Sees.
Her father makes and her brother
• e l l s ladles'underwear. She models
i t (see photo above). Altogether she
i» a well-rounded personality.

UNION MEETINGS
The Extraordinary General Meeting
of the I.C .Union, held i n HM Concert
H a l l on Oct. 22nd, was l i v e l y and well-
attended, with some good •peaking both
from Chad' i n the chair and from the
f l o o r . The elections were quickly dis-
posed of, and Xovember 5th then dis-
cussed. In spite of an u p l i f t i n g speech
from the floor, reminding Members of
"the proud heritage of our predeces-
sors, who l a i d down their t h i r t y bobs
at Bow Street Magistrates Court? the
attitude towards the Harlington fest-
i v i t i e s was favourable. Prom the floor
members were advised, i f apprehended,
not to state that they were students,
since they would then incur a further
penalty from the University.
A motion,.proposed by John D e l l ,
that Chad' be presented with a bowler
hat to be worn while r i d i n g his 'new'
bleyole waa passed unanimously; such
a hat has now been donated.
FIREWORKS AS SCIENTISTS MEET
The R.C.S. Union meeting on October
Slat proved one of the l i v e l i e s t f o r a
long time. A state of war has been dec-
lared between the Botany and Geology
depts., and fireworks were very much i n
evidence, Aoonsiderable amount of water
was also l e t loose, and Miss Heywood
raised an umbrella with which she had
thoughtfully equipped herself.
Another B.C.S. mascot has made i t s
appearance. Known as Fred, i t l a a b i -
cycle, complete save for a chain, whioh
i s to be used by President Butters, who
showed perfect poise i n lapping the ros-
trum.
On observing John Hation copying
out the "Kangella" from a piece of paper,
Eair Hopkins proposed that he should be
nade to reoite i t — or be debagged. As
amendment that should he succeed, Eeir
would be debagged, was oarrled unan-
imously. The Secretary rose to the oc-
casion — and Hopkins lost his trousers.
As the result of another action,
the Secretary has been instructed to i n -
v i t e the Mayor of Maidenhead to the next
R.C.S.U. meeting.
C & G M O R P H Y F A S H I O N S
The f i r s t Guilds Union meeting of
the session could be aptly described as
an hour of continuous entertainment. The
highlight of the meeting was bearded
Mike Clark's "Freshers' Guide to Morphy
Day Fashions" Among the styles modelled
were "The Roughneck" — dilapidation
personified, and a very practical " B o i l -

his holiday.
er Suit*! A dapper aad debonair, unsus-
pecting "Brown-bagger" attracted howls
and hisses. "The Continental" type per-
formed an Anglo-European one-piece two-
step — a considerable feat In skin-
tight pants.
"Bloody thoughts and dirty deeds"
were suggested by the ice-axe of "The
Mountaineer" and the scalpels and bone-
saws provided i n "The Surgeon"'• Do-it-
yourself k i t , Mike Clark himself pro-
vided the climax, appearing i n a knee-
length Victorian swimming costume — i n
0. a G. colours: a r i o t of laughter
with a pronounced Lancashire accent
ensued.
Attempts by our fine feathered
friend Mr Lenssen to gate-crash the
show were heavily repulsed.
