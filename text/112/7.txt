CLARIDGES
Commemoration B a l l this year waa at
Claxidges, where one would expeet the height
of luxury — at a price. Surprisingly enough
one did not need to spend very mush money i f
ones consumption of alcohol was curtailed;
the orange squash was free'.
The excellent running buffet more than
compensated for the lack of "ample seating
accommodation'.' Waiters did not seem to ex-
pect a t i p , and one of them retired grate-
f u l l y pocketing a halfpenny which mistaken-
".y was put on his tray i n return for some
orange squash.
The President of I.C. was naturally there,
looking as i f he very often attended these
Balls: upon entering the ballroom each couple
was announced by a l i v e r i e d flunkey to the
President and his lady.
The Boomalaka whioh seems to have become
traditional at the B a l l provided a rousing
finale to a function we oan a l l thoroughly
recommend.
WINE TASTING SOCIETY
•It i s an interesting fact that the
tasting of I t a l i a n wines i s seldom i n -
cluded i n the programme of leading wine
establishments. Everyone who attended the
meeting on October 29th. w i l l agree that
t h i s i s a grave omission. Pew countries
can boast of a greater output or variety,
which even surpasses that of Prance.
Mr. Ruffino, who spoke at very short
notice, delivered a talk remarkable for
i t s brevity and i t s preoise s c i e n t i f i c
nature containing 1.J* by volume
of s o l i d matter,...."
The varied nature cf I t a l i a n wines i s
such that i t i s impossible to cover the
whole range i n the time available. Members
tasted no fewer than eight varieties, a
summary of whioh i s given below :-
Ohianti. This i s the most well-known I t a l -
ian wine i n this country, and i t s bright
and l i v e l y appearance makes an immediate
appeal to the eye and the palate, the
straw-covered flask adding greatly to i t s
attractiveness.
Valpolioella Superiore and Bandoline
These two pleasant beverage wines are much
l i g h t e r i n body and colour than Chianti.
Barolo. Often described as the King of .
I t a l i a n wines, i t i s b i g and full-bodied
with a r i c h ruby colour and a fragrant
bouquet, having some of the character-
i s t i c s of Burgundy.
A s t i Spumante. This wine i s a product of
the muscatel grape and i s one of the most
famous sparkling wines i n the world,
"Opening with a pop that promises delight".
More luscious than champagne, i t has great
popularity with the ladies.
Cinzano Bianco and Vermouth. These are
much heavier wines than their predecessors
and have a characteristic aroma and flavour.
I.C. RIDES AGAIN
Last Sunday I.C. Biding Club contin-
ued i t s explorations of the English
eountrrside with a four hour ride i n
ths Chiltsrns. Bo accidents occurred
(not quite1) "and a l l eight riders en-
joyed themselves. Some of ths scenery
was almost too good to be true, i t
looked ss though i t had come straight
out of a tourist pamphlet.

TOUCHSTONE
"The aims and purposes of an University
Education" was the t i t l e of t h i s sessions
f i r s t Touchstone weekend. The guest spea-
ker, Prof. A.R. Ubbelohde of the Chemical
Engineering Department, introduced the
subject i n a masterly manner, showing i n
his t a l k the advantages of a wide
education.
PROBLEMS WHERE ART MEETS SCIENCE.
The burden of vocational training has
to be carried by an University, hence i t
i s essential that a l i b e r a l education be
planned so that graduates might gain an
insight into the wealth and breadth of
human understanding. I t must be decided
whether such an education upsets profess,
ional efficiency, and also whether planned
courses are a good thing.
A Multi-faculty administration had i t s
shortcomings; Prof. X. offered £ 2 0 , 0 0 0
for some important medical research might
require £ 2 f 0 , 0 0 0 ; Prof Y. might receive
£ 5 , 0 0 0 for excavating minor Greek ruins,
for which £ 5 0 0 would suffioe. I t seemed
that i n such oases many problems would
arise, and i n fact they did so.
PCEPLEDOFPLE AND PLANNING,
The professor said he had few regrets
for his own education, and recalled one
small but typical example of the Oxbridge
way of l i f e : a oertain Professor Popple-
dopple, who had dug up a seductive marble
torso i n Tuscany, emerging from his be-
statued rooms only on yery rare occasions,
t o shuffle laorossi the' Quad with the torso
under his arm!
On planning a broad education, he ass-
erted that i t can go to extremes: c i t i n g
as an example the arrangement of l i b r a r i e s .
The Classicists t r y to have Aristotle o r
V i r g i l interspersed with Shaw and Shake-
speare, so that brousers find things they
don't want to read as they search for that
which they do. ^he Scientists on the other
hand prefer their l i b r a r i e s arranged i n a
universal way such thet a l l books on a
given subject shall be together.
THE EDUCATED MAN.
The professor ocntinued by saying that
an educated man's knowledge was unified,
i.e. there were no clear cut boundaries
between one subject and the next. He
quoted Leibnitz as an example! there was
a man, b r i l l i a n t i n his contributions t o
Mathematics and Philosopy, who also had a
not undistinguished career as a diplomatist
At this point the professor pointed out
that there was a beer bottle i n the chand-
e l i e r , and stressed the importance of
social intercourse. Much good cams of a
few people meeting together over a drink
YHA. CYCLING GROUP
On Saturday Oct. 26th. seven members
made their various ways to Houghton H i l l
Youth Hostel near Huntington to inaug-
urate the cycling section of the group.
The hostel warden turned out to be a
g i r l of about 24, extremely attractive,
but married. The hostel i t s e l f i s
eqipped with a fascinating but defunct
m i l l apparatus -there were no oasualities
i n the millpond.
The return t r i p was made v i a Cam-
bridge and Pinching f i e l d with several
stops for "brew-ups". A nucleus of
c y c l i s t s has now been formed and i t i s
hoped to see them again on the Alfriston
weekend (walkers and cyclists) on the
16/17th. November.
to have a general discussion. He f e l t , h»
said, on many occasions l i k e Polonius i n
Hamlet...(did you know, as tha professor
pointed out,that Hamlet was Shakespeare's
only undergraduate?)
DISCUSSION.
After dinner, three groups formed to
discuss some questions posed by the pro-
fessor. These included whether i t was leg.
itimate to give time and opportunity for
other studies during an undergraduate
course? How far can the techniques of
University education be planned from above';
Do students make adequate use of the div-
erse educated pleasures i n London? Should
a l l Undergraduates aim to l i v e away from
home: and how oan one keep f i t with a l l
the claims on one's time during term?
DOWN WITH CHEMISTRY.
It was f e l t that the lecture courses
contained too much chaff, especially work
that had already been covered at school,
and that as there were minimum entrance
requirements, these oourses should be
draatioally revised. Among the more
encouraging facts was that t h i r d year
Guildsman spend at least one morning a
week at L.S.E.
Pleasure was considered a personal
problem, and everyone should be able t o
use his leisure hours as he chose provided
his work was well done. There was unanim-
ous hate for the methods of the Chemistry
Department i n extorting work from long-
suffering students, especially the lecturer
who expooted his research students to work
a 70 hour week; and the tutors who recom-
mended that undergraduates should take
l i t t l e or no part i n extra-mural a c t i v i t i e s
reminding them that the laboratories are
open for work from 9 a.m« to 5.30 p.m.
SOME BROADENING SUGGESTIONS.
Suggestions for further non-scientific
studies were Civios, Languages and English
Literature. The presence of smaller C o l l -
eges prompted the suggestion that their
Hall 3 of residence should be integrated
so that each Hall contained students
working i n different faoulties. The secret-
a r i a l colleges could be included easily
i n this plan, as this would give a stimul-
ating effect on a student's l i f e t I t waa
thought that a l l f i r s t and t h i r d year
students should l i v e i n Halls of Residence,
while second year students should l i v e i n
lodgings, whioh are an education i n them-
selves.
Opinions on keeping f i t , varied from
the squash-fiends and the rutmers-round-
tho-park, to those who thought that auv
form of physical exertion was bad for the
mind.
"Whereof wo cannot speak, we must needs
be silent*.
