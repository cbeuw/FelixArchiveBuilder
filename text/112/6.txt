Commemoration Say this year followed the now established r i t u a l . Over 600 students
and their friends attended the Ceremony In the Royal albert H a l l , at which the Associates,
Diplomates and Honorary Fellows were presented, and addresses given by the Sector and the
Special V i s i t o r , S i r Alexander Fleck, with some leavening by the Choir of the Musical
Society.
E a r l i e r i n the afternoon a service was held i n Holy Trinity Church, then at three
o'clock the prooession entered the h a l l , and the Commemoration of the v i s i t of His Late
Majesty King George VI at the time of the o f f i c i a l Centenary of the College had begun.
An immediate contretemps was averted by the presence of mind of Professor Hewitt, who,
on observing that his o f f i c i a l pro-rectorial front-row seat was not i n evidence, pro-
ceeded with perfect composure to a spare seat i n the block reserved for professors and
readers. A l l seated, the Choir gave tongue to a rousing "Gandeamug Igitur", and the
Secretary of the Onion, Richard Gamett, then read the opening Proclamation, heralding
the presentation of Associates and Diplomates. Last year's innovation of soft music
during the presentation of the Guilds Associates was this year extended to include the
presentation of the A.R.C.S.'s and D.I.C.'s.
In h i s f i n a l year aa Clerk to the
Governors, Colonel Lowry exercised his
usual wit and anecdotal humour i n pre-
senting the Honorary Fellows. They i n -
cluded MT Ssvid Gamett, who obtained a
D.I.C. i n Botany and has since become
very well known i n the world of letters;
S i r Harold Bishop, a Gulldaman who join-
ed the B.B.C. i n 1923, and who occasion-
ed the remark that "the Alexandra and
Crystal Palaces have become Bishop's
palaces"; Dr X. Hlndle; Professor Em-
eritus H. Levy, not today "jaoketless
with h i s shirt unbuttoned and hair f l y -
ing" ; Mr p. Bacons, a "finer who fought
under Smuts i n the f i r s t World War;
Professor Emeritus H.H.Read, ex-Dean of
-the R.C.S.| and Mr C J.R.Sams. S i r
William Penney was unable to be present
either last year or t h i s , and "the doc-
ument w i l l be sent to him by post?
The Rector presented his report on
the progress of the College during last
year, and the Choir then sang "Blest Fair
of Sirens" with "..saintly shout and
solemn jubilee.." Viscount Falmouth now
introduced S i r Alexander Fleck, Chairman
of I.C.I., who, i n h i s speech, brought
out some of the parallelisms between I.C.
and I.C.I., and made some very cogent
remarks on students and Industry. Vis-
count Falmouth brought the Ceremony to a
close, and the proceedings ended with "God
save the Queen" and the Recession.
THE RECTOR'S REPORT
The Reetor opened by welcoming the
many guests and friends of the College,
and i n particular the Vice-Chancellor of
the university. He believed that this was
the f i r s t time that the Vice-Chancellor
had attended the Commemoration Day cele-
brations .
Dr Linatead referred to the rapid
growth of the College. "When we assem-
bled here last year the number of f u l l -
time students was 2,215. Today i t i s
2,450, an increase of 235. The overall
increase i n the four years of our ex-
pansion i s now 800. By this c r i t e r i o n
we are sere than half-way to the target
given us by the Government i n 1953. The
number of new professorships and reader-
ships has gone up by f i f t e e n since we
last assembled i n this Hall1
:
The Rector also had something to
•ay on the subject of student residence,
"Last year we had accommodation f o r 105
students, today the figure i s 153. This
i s p i t i f u l l y small f o r a College of our
size. However, the plans for the new
£150,000 Weeks H a l l , to be erected In
the Worth-West corner of Prince's Gar-
dens, hare now been drawn up and approv-
ed.
" . . i t i s with great pleasure that I
oan announce tills afternoon a piece of
stop-press news. We hare now been given
authority to proceed with the clearance
of the existing derelict buildings on the
s i t e , not merely of Weeks Hall, but of
the entire College property on the East
sad South sides i f the square. The nego-
tiations i n which we are involved are
long, complicated and sometimes wearisome.
But here i s another hurdle cleared';

"I would also like to say a word
about an unusual event of the College
year. A year ago the Hungarian r i s i n g
ocourred and a considerable number of
Hungarian university students case to
this country needing help; academic
help and food and shelter. The College
made a great effort, which involved
Governors, students past and present,
staff and their wives. We set up at
short notice an emergency hostel i n
whioh some twenty Hungarian students
lived; six Hungarians became full-time
students of the College last year and
there are ten this year. In a l l a sum
of over £1,500 has been contributed to
the r e l i e f of Hungarian students, I
would like to thank a l l those who help-
ed*:
SIR ALEXANDER FLECK
In his introduction of the Special
V i s i t o r , Visoount Falmouth said that the
presence of S i r Alexander Fleck symbol-
ised the close ties between Imperial Col-
lege and industry. Aa Chairman of I.C.I,
and President-elect of the B r i t i s h As-
sociation, S i r Alexander needed no intro-
duction to this audience. He had been
trained as a scientist, writing a thesis
on the chemistry of the radio-elements,
and had now become a great administrator,
chairman of a company worth £500 million.
This wai a very cheering and encouraging
sign of the times.
Sir Alexander expressed h i s grati-
f i c a t i o n at being asked to be Special
V i s i t o r , particularly so i n the Jubilee
year of the College charter. We eould
contemplate with satisfaction based on
f i f t y years* experience the successful
welding together of the three constit-
uent Colleges, there was every indicat-
ion ef a youthful s p i r i t ef adventure.
closely connected with our " o f f i c i a l l y
induced middle-age spread*: Our great
development scheme was a cause for re-
joicing. He recalled that there was a
chronic shortage of technologists even
i n the f i r s t century AJ>.,when the
Emperor Trajan replied to the younger
Pliny's request f o r technical assistance
i n the Middle East:"I scarcely have
enough engineers to deal with works i n
and about Rome*:
Sir Alexander stated that he was -
an unrepentant representative of ind-
ustry."A purposeful business enterprise?
he said,"properly run with a l l regardto
i t s many responsibilities to the com-
munity. .. .serves the peoples just as
effectively....as those who are directly
concerned i n education? That was one
p a r a l l e l between I.C. and I.C.I. There
was another,"Both organisations, I would
suggest, were fortunate i n this process of
amalgamating distinct but essentially
a l l i e d constituents....in both our cases
has been a source of strength and a
source of inspiration?
"There i s no doubt i n my mind" S i r
Alexander affirmed,"that the organisations
best....able to advance on the present
floodtide of technical progress are those
i n which the s p i r i t of studentship s t r -
ongly survives. The student i s one who
should be at his most receptive to new
ideas, who maintains long after he has
put behind him his formal College educat-
ion a f l e x i b l e mind and an evergreen cap-
acity for enjoyment i n many branches of
knowledge.
"The second quality that a student
must possess i s an enquiring mind. The
true student seeks knowledge for i t s own
sake. Certainly a primary effort must be
made to obtain an understanding of baaic
principles, but we must avoid becoming
factually muscle-bound. A l l of us, new
students and old alike, require to exer-
cise good Judgment.
T H E R E C E S S I O N
"These are some of the intellectual
aarks of the good student. However, the
most valuable student i s the one who com-
bines intellect with character. Character
i s a somewhat vague term but, so far aa
industry i s concerned, i t oan at least be
made manifest i n terms of leadership and
we can a l l recognise leadership when we
see a willingness to accept responsibili-
ty and at an appropiate point i n time to
make decisions? Important also were
"understanding and comradeship"
"But i f character manifests Itself
i n leadership, i t s essence i s to be found
i n the individual personality. Our stud-
ents aast have l i v e l y well-stocked minds
and we should like then to be leaders.
But above a l l l e t thea be individuals.
In an age ef machines and machinery, the
personality of the individual i s some-
thing to be guarded....and to be develop-
ed te i t s f u l l eapaeity.lt i s a high Im-
perial concept to create a unity out of
diversity without damaging what i s val-
uable i n that diversity?
