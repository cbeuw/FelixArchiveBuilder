THE IMPERIAL CINEMA
a FELIX on-tha-spot report.
i s a nearby clock chimed tan minutes
past two a.m. on Commemoration Say,
eight oddly attired figures emerged
from a certain hostelry anrnuring
"Rhubarb", as i s their custom at this
time of night after a party) hut they
had not been to a party — this was to fool
the watchman. One mounted a bicycle
and, slipping swiftly through the
gears, disappeared i n ths direction of
Onsen's Oats. The others vanished into the
night to prearranged positions, covering
a l l passible approaches to Prince Consort
Road.
Several minutes later three more
figures issued forth, one nonchalantly
swingingly a bucket and brush. Then
two silsnt shadows sprinted to the top
of Prince Consort Road, and with practised
hands untied and removed a ladder from the
scaffolding there. A taxi driver who was
watching ths proceedings with obvious
interest quickly absented himself with a
look of terror on his face when one of
ths shadows moved menacingly towards him.
The ladder found i t s way to the side
of the Aero Block, but no sooner had I t
been placed i n position when a warning came
from' the cyclist that a suspicious-looking
blue- he lasted gentleman was l o i t e r i n g with
intent i n the v i c i n i t y . This warning i n i t -
iated a series of chain reactions which
dispersed ths conspirators, while the cyc-
l i s t adopted a French accent and,
professing to know l i t t l e of the English
language, successfully delayed and exas-
perated the gendarme, giving the others
time to make good their escape.
After this rude interruption ths
Aero Block was attacked with renewed
vigour. A large poster, depioting the
usual evocative, scantily sled female,
was s t r c fi.Taly i n position with a
paste brewed from flour and sise;
"Imperial Cinema" was placed on the awning;
two notices dlrsetin:"Q here 1/6", "Q
here £1" were posted onto p i l l a r s ; and
l a s t l y a large poster announcing coming
attractions was attached to the glass
front.
The decoration was complete; the
ladder reappeared on the scaffolding
and the watchdogs were called i n , chased
by a police ear whioh was, however,
f o i l e d when the "dogs" ran down the
Albert Hall steps. After casting an
appreciative glance at their a r t i s t r y ,
eleven weary bodies returned to their
respective havens of rea-fc.
Soon after dawn the watchmen discovered
the phenomena and, uttering their usual
profanities .proceeded to scraps off ths
offending hotices. The removal of the
large poster presented some d i f f i c u l t y ,
but after several hours i t f i n a l l y
yielded to the paint scraper.
So yet another theatre has been closed.
Perhaps someone w i l l ssk questions i n
Parliament about i t . Don't tarry, Larry;
