I.C. 1st.17 have won five of their eight
matches t o date. With a weakened side,
I.C. beat TJ.C. by 15 pta. t o 3, whioh

Gilbert when almost simultaneously they
lost their hooker Gibbons, with a fractured
toe, and t h e i r centre Brougham, with a out

Hookey Victory
The hookey team had a well-earned
victory over King's College I I last
Saturday, the f i n a l score being 4-3.
At half-time King's were leading 3-2
but i n the second half I.C. made an
all-out effort and completely.out-
played the opposing team.
Table Tennis
The table tennis team put up a
good fight against Royal Holloway,
the match ending i n a drew, 5-5.
SWIMMING
1.0. Win Two Matches
The last two weeks have seen the start
of a series of matches f o r the Swimming
Club. In a recent match against U.C. the
I.C. team took f i r s t place i n every event.
B.Beckett gave I.C. their f i r s t win, i n
the 100 yards freestyle, with A.Cowen i n
third place. The university Champion,
R.Loveman, had no d i f f i c u l t y i n winning the
breast stroke with P.Hills a good second.
In the absence of R.Harford, Spokes gained
an easy win i n the baok stroke, with
W.Corrigan second, despite his reluctance
to swim. In the team relay, R.Larson gave
I.C. a good start, which was maintained by
the rest of the team.
Result: I.C. 37 pts. TJ.C. 21 pts.
Polo result: I.C. won 9-1.
Last Friday I.C. played Q.M.C. aad,
despite having a weakened team, and tha
i n a b i l i t y of one member to f i n d the baths,
won by 30-28 points. International Tasker
won two events f o r Q.M.C. but wins In the
relays deolded the match i n our favour.
The polo team d i d not play well f o r the
f i r s t half and were at one time -4-1 down.
Improving i n the second half they reduced
the d e f i c i t , but despite two goals by
B.Hart, lost 4-3.
CROSS COUNTRY
Collina Second In U.L. T r i a l s
On Cot. 2 3 r d . I.C. suffered a painful
defeat at the hands of King's College on
t h e i r course of 6-J- miles. I.C. produced
the f i r s t three men home, but King's then
packed.a s o l i d bunch of six, whioh promptly
decided the result.
A small band of I.C. men entered the
U.L. T r i a l s on Sat. 26th.Oct. at P a r l i a -
ment H i l l Fields. We congratulate John
Collins on h i s fine effort i n ooming
second t o S h i l l i t o e of L.S.E. Our freshers
A.Brash and A.Brown d i d very well to
f i n i s h 1 2 t h . and 1 4 t h . resulting i n the
former being just i n and the l a t t e r just
out of the University second team. For
the rest of the band, the beat that can
be aaid Is that they packed extremely
well, but unfortunately well t o the rear
of the f i e l d .
On 3 0 t h , Oct. the second team defeated
Borough Road on the I.C. course at Peter-
sham by a very small margin. Only the
lowly positions of the l a s t two scoring
men from Borough Road caused t h e i r
defeat. Brown ran excellently t e record
bis f i r s t match victory f o r I.C.
F i n a l l y , on 2nd. Nov., at Hayes i n
Kent I.C. came t h i r d toflensbury and
Lloyds Bank but defeated Barclays and the
Stock Exchange. However, the highly
ooaplex course oan be largely blamed f o r
our failure. For the second successive
year, a number of I.C. men pioneered their
owa routes, whioh were rather longer than
the o f f i c i a l course. Our f i r s t man home
was J.Conway, who finished 5 t h . out of a
f i e l d of 4 2 . K.Wall ran'sanely, f o r a
change, and starting at the baok moved
through the f i e l d t o f i n i s h 1 0 t h . ,
instead of starting at the front and
steadily dropping back, and back,...
The past fortnight cannot be called
successful by any stretch of imagination.
The top men i n the Club axe running well,
but the â€¢middLe" of the Club i s f a r
below l a s t year'a standard. F u l l your

SOCCER
I.C. Cut Of U.L. Cup
The Soccer 1st.XI has had two setbacks
recently. After winning s i x games i n a
row, and soaring 31 goals to 8 against,
we were defeated by U.C. i n a League
match by 5 goals to 4, and by King'a
3-2, after extra time, i n the f i r s t round
of the Cup.
U.O. had a f l y i n g start i n this imp-
ortant match when they scored two goals
i n the f i r s t ten minutes. However, I.C.
fought baok strongly, with goals by
Codling(2), Wank and Paddle, to lead 4-2.
For most of the second half, the play was
very even, but the last fifteen minutes
proved disastrous; U.C. obtained three
more goals, the winner ooming i n the last
seconds of the game. The obvious lesson
to be learned from this i s that the team
must play all-out f o r the f u l l 90 mins.
Again i n the King's match I.C. con-
ceded a goal I n the opening minutes.
Although I.C. soon equalised, King's
continued t o play the better football
whilst 1.0. placed too much reliance on
long b a l l s down the middle, many of whioh
were intercepted. I f I.C. had had as much
control as they had enthouslasm, the result
would have been mare favourable.
The 2nd., 3rd., and 4th. teams have
won a l l their League matches to date, the
4th. XI record being 7 wins and a goal
average of 3 4 against 9 . The 5th. XI
results have not been quite ao good,
but this i s rather to be expected from
a newly-farmed experimental team.
HOCKEY
F i r s t XI S t i l l Unbeaten
The blockey Club continues to be
victorious. Last Wednesday, I.C. 1 s t . n
beat U.C. 1st. 5-1, and cn Saturday
Q.M.C. 1st. 4-0. Against U.C. the h a l f -
time score was 1-1, but the I.C. team
asserted i t s superiority i n the second half.
Tha Q.M.C. match was similar; the I.C. team
appears to wear down the opposition by
strong hitting and running and by general
fitness.

SOUASH
Good Start To Season
Of the f i v e fixtures arranged f o r Oct.
two were cancelled, we won two and l o s t
one. We were beaten 4-1 by a strong team
from Middlesex Hospital, but In two of
the tlea the opponents were forced four
times to match point. We were victorious
against Southampton, beating them by 3
games to 2; this i s a new and enjoyable
fixture. Last Thursday evening we met
an old r i v a l , the School of Oriental and
African Studies, and defeated them 4-1.
So much f a r the 1st. V.
The standard of play of the 2nd. teem
i a higher than l a s t year, although they
have started the season with but mixed
success. Potentially this i s a strong
2nd. V, and under the able leadership
of Bob Lloyd i t should do great things.
Both teems would benefit from pro-
fessional poaching, and we have been t r y -
ing since July to find a coach, ao f a r
without success. However, a possibility
has at last arisen, and correspondence i s
i n progress.
The enthousiaatio interest demonstrated
by newcomers t o the Club i s laudable, and
they are encouraged to make the most o f
the Club's f a c i l i t i e s ( at 5/- per annua)
especially the Ladder. A player who
successfully climbs the Ladder w i l l thereby
win a place i n the teem and represent the
College. There's also Sport i n tha
offing: we have a regular fixture with the
U.L. Ladies .
