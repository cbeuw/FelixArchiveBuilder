Ash
I n t e r g a l a c t i c S o n i c 7 " s
For a band whose average age is
still a relatively young 25, it's a
massive compliment to Ash and
their understated ability to write
killer pop songs using nothing
more than guitar, bass and
drums that they have decided to
release Intergalactic Sonic 7"s,
a definitive collection of the
band's singles to date.
It's been ten years since Tim
Wheeler, Mark Hamilton and
Rick McMurray first played their
inaugural London show to a
sceptical audience still bewil-
dered by the grunge fallout and
unaware of the massive impact
Britpop was set to cause over
the ensuing twelve months.
Pogo-sticks a-go-go, let's
jump up and down to welcome
back the precocious songsters
on a break from recording their
fifth album. Burn Baby Burn is
fabulous, and is welcomingly
faded into the current single: the
excellent, yet thrashy, Envy.
New songs fit alongside old
songs seamlessly, as we find the
songs are grouped musically, i.e.
fast and slow together, rather
than chronologically. We have
their first big hit Girl from Mars
next to their comeback to the big
time, infectiously simple
Shining Light. Their most
famous soundtrack offering, A
Life Less Ordinary,
old favourite, the
shimmer of
Excellent stuff.
Whilst some of the early sin-
gles {Petrol and Uncle Pat) can
be dismissed as nervous, fey
indie warblings, the likes of Jack
Names The Planets and Kung
Fu provided strong hints at what
the band were capable of
achieving, and by the time their
debut album 1977 was
released, they'd already chalked
up three top ten hits (Girl From
Mars, Angel Interceptor and Oh
Yeah).
As most of their Britpop peers
have crashed and burned, this
compilation hits it home that
Ash have only just begun to get
into their stride.

quiet, loud
Goldfinger.

Editor's Corner
Welcome to another year of great music, reviews
and interviews in the music pages, not to mention
the infliction of my nonsensical rambling upon you!
As before, we'll be concentrating on a variety of
music we feel will be popular amongst the student
population, with the aim of catering to as wide a
variety of musical tastes possible. We'll bring you
album reviews, singles reviews and live reviews,
not to mention exclusive interviews (Felix has
interviewed Beverley Knight, A and King Adora
amongst other great acts in the past). Stolen con-
cept from last year's Felix, (sorry David) I'll be run-
ning a competition every week if possible, allowing
you to have a chance at CD's, concert tickets and
other random merchandise that the record compa-
nies decide to send me.
This week's issue includes the Reading Round
Up and Murderdolls interview, courtesy of Joe
Parker of IC Radio, an 'Out This Week' section and
competition for the new Coldplay album.
The Garbage picture, of course, is there, not
because we're reviewing the ten millionth single off
their year-old album, but because they look cool.
Your comments, questions and opinions are always
welcome - just send an email to music.felix@ic.ac.uk
Singles
Ooberman - Beany Bean
Shiny, happy, and pointless
I don't know where to start. This
single comes across as a swirl of
atino-happy jangly guitars and
shifting beats, with interludes
from a choir of girls, and a guy
strongly reminiscent of the
Streets. It's mad, it's a rush, but
with its jazzy background of
brass not unknown to Madness,
and its undecipherable lyrics, I
don't know what to feel - it's not
a definite like for me, that's for
sure.

James Yorkston and The
Athletes - Tender to the Blues
EP
The wavefront of artistic, nu-
acoustic groups seems to expand
profusely every week, and this
group, which uses their great
pride in their deployment of
orchestral instruments as their
selling point, is no exception.
Interested? Bet you aren't. I was-
n't, but I found myself drawn in
by the power of the music. Is it
not a drain to listen to? No. A
hard-core popaholic such as
(who incidentally possesses the
attention span of a goldfish drop-
ping), was thoroughly charmed
by the title track, Tender to the
Blues, a story of past love, and
ingenuity shown in 6:30 Is Way
Too Early, the use of medieval
sounds strikingly effective.
Chilled out to the max, it has the
effect of a meditation tape, with-
out being boring or bland. You
actually want to know what he
wants to say, unlike most sleepy
nu-acoustic acts, who seem to
spend more time working out
how to pare down, what is
already pared down. Hare's on
the mountain/Old maid, a folksy,
banjo-led take on a traditional, is
the second highlight, inventive
slow, yet compellingly listenable.
