Murderdolls
J o e P a r k e r
Fire! Brimstone! Small girls tor-
menting old men with wasps and
honey... this is the world of
Slipknot, the self-styled 'death
metal' band hated by mums and
aped by kids the world over. So
when 'Joey Jordison, Slipknot
Drummer' drops a CD in the
office (ok, his PR company),
labelled 'Murderdolls - Side
Project', we got out the salt and
josssticks and prepared for Satan
himself to pop out of the speak-
ers.
We were pretty surprised, then,
when the album turned out to be
a ferrally energetic ramalama
sounding affair, with more in
common with The Munsters than
Chucky. It's upbeat, gothy and
punky all in one massive tongue-
in-cheek sweep, and quite possi-
bly one of the most infectious
records of the year. Surprise
turned to delight when we read
the small print at the bottom of
the release, offering an interview.
We rushed down to the plush K-
West hotel in Richmond to find
out what had gone wrong in
Shock City.
Inside the light, airy forum of
the hotel, one entire end of the
room is taken up with photogra-
phers' paraphernalia. Several
people scurry around, and wait-
ers and a concierge fuss round a
table in the centre of the room,
where two serious-looking blokes
are sitting and drinking cocktails
(it's a little after two in the after-
noon.) Striding up, I announce
Felix's arrival in my best throaty
journo tones. The men look up
blankly. I try again, explaining
that we're here to interview
Interview
27th August 2002
Murderdolls, you know, the
Slipknot side-project...
"Oh," exclaims the chap, in a
very British accent, "Do you
mean the band? I think that's
them, over there."
Looking over, a small group of
guys, dressed in rock-goth-punk
attire lounge in one corner of the
room, laughing and drinking Diet
Cokes (mostly). Ah, I think.
It turns out Joey has to dash to
see a friend ("this old hippy; my
old man's man" - probably bull-
shit, too bad.) So instead I'm
introduced to a Rock Guitarist. I
know he's a Rock Guitarist,
because a) he looks the part - all
dye and piercings and big rings,
b) he's called 'AC (no, really) and
c) he has a handshake like a steel
press.
AC joined the group a few
months ago, when Tripp Eisen
(Static X), who also played in the
group, had to leave. So after fee-
bly apologising for mistaking two
investment bankers for the rock
band (oh, and carting in a tape
recorder the size of a TV - but
that's another story), I put it to
him, jokingly of course, that he
may not be a 'real' band member,
after all.
"No way!" he exclaims, "It
wasn't that difficult. Wednesday
[13]'s only been in since March.
We have a lotta fun in this group
- everybody's new - and we kinda
had a raport already, you know?
"We went to the Summer Sonic
festival, in Japan? It was cool,
though we just hung out in the
hotel a lot of the time. Meeting
the Hanoi Rocks guys was
cool..."
Jesus, I think, it's like bloody
Spinal Tap USA. But in fact, AC
turns out to be a friendly, witty
and interesting interviewee. In
particular, there's none of the
cynicism or stench of self-impor-
tance than usually hangs 'round
UK acts. Refreshing. Still, not
quite the hotel trashing, bone-
smoking, groupie soddomising
monster I'd expected. So what's
going on? Where's the integrity,
man?
"I joined this group because
that's what I wanted to do for
fun," he declares earnestly, "This
is a big risk - there's none of the
stuff that goes on with promoting
other bands - so if we were con-
cerned about getting our man-
sions and cars, or whatever, this
is the last place we'd be."
Still, I suggest, with the
'Slipknot side-project' tag
inevitably attached, they won't
exactly lose money...
"Yeah, I guess so. So I suppose
it's like, $lmillion with integrity
versus $4million of dirty money!"
He laughs.
Hmm. So how have the 14-
year-old hoodie posse taken to
the show, I wonder?
"Well, at first the audience is
kinda like a deer in the head-
lights. But by the second half,
they're feeding off Murderdolls'
special energy, our abrasiveness,
too, and... it's fun! That's the
main thing. It's like going to a
strip bar compared to a boxing
match."
And those, erm, odd lyrics, half
Young Frankenstein, half Jerry
Springer?
"It's all on the fun side - horror
movies, stuff like that." He paus-
es. "It's not based on... personal
experience."
They're clearly an ambitious
bunch - or just optimistic - happy
to daydream about awards and
albums to come when we bring it
up, plus collaborations with Alice
Cooper ("Hey, he's Alice, you
know!") But will the record-buy-
ing public take to tongue-in-
cheek goth-rock? Hell, do they
even know what it is?
"It's like Kiss. They had a stu-
pid idea, people laughed - but
they did believe in what they
were doing, in a way, and they're
still around today!"
The interview ends - AC wants
to go shopping and ride a London
Bus.
In The Shadow Of The Valley
Of The Murderdolls is out in the
shops now on Roadrunner
Records.

Review

(believe me). We love it though.
Top marks for punk-with-a-
point go to NOFX, who manage
to be drunk, funny, dumb and
intelligent all at the same time.
And poke blunt but 'incisive' fun
at Dubbya, too ('Idiot Son Of An
Asshole'.) Oh well, it's still funny,
and they've got us roaring.
Sheer nerve pulls The Hives
though a set wracked by sound
problems. "You wanna know
what we both have in common?"
bawls the Swede, "We both love
me!" Damn right!
Audience participation is
always fun, but The Strokes go
one further, NYC-style, as
50,000 people sing 'Happy
Birthday' to a haplessly drunk
Julian Casablancas. Factor in
Jack White, Rob Pollack (Guided
By Voices) and electric new tunes
and you've got it: the perfect
headline set.
