F E L I X U N I O N
By Students, For Students
Today will mark the end of the
Freshers Week which is
undoubtedly one of the busiest
weeks of the year and firstly I
would like to start by saying a
personal thank you to all the
staff who have worked incredibly
hard to support all the students
especially the freshers.
I hope you have enjoyed your
first few days at Imperial. Most
of you will have met a huge
number of people, signed up for
many clubs and societies and
started getting involved in all the
activities and services the Union
offers. For those you haven't
there will still be plenty of
opportunities to do so over the
coming weeks. This year promis-
es to be an exciting year and this
week I thought I would let you
know what the Union is doing
and keep you updated on a cou-
ple of recent developments.
Volunteering in the Community
"Volunteering in the
Community" is a new project
started in conjunction with the
College to encourage more stu-
dents to participate in local
community. The full scheme will
be launched in January but
there are plenty of opportunities
to get involved now. The
Imperial Dance Company will be
touring the local schools teach-
ing modern and contemporary
dance. Or why not try the
Community Action Group which
operates soup runs for the
homeless. There are more
opportunities with the sports
teams to teach local children or
help teach in local schools. If
you are interested in these proj-
ects or want to start others,
please contact me.
Student Development
Students at Imperial have
access to some of the best
teaching and research anywhere
in the world. However, it is
important to realise that there is
more to your development than
you degree or research. You will
need other skills, skills such as
time management, leadership -
skills that will be of practical use
for your future careers. The
Union has embarked on a pro-
gramme to develop skills work-
shops. During the course of the
autumn term you will hear of
these programmes so watch this
space for more.
Come and run the Union
As I have mentioned in my
previous article the Union is an
organisation run by students for
students. Each year a number of
officers are elected to run and
manage the Union - but most
importantly these officers are
accountable to you. You can
have a say on the conduct of the
officers, how the Union oper-
ates, how we spend the millions
we receive and much more
besides.
A good place to start is
Council. Council is the governing
body of Union and responsible
for all aspects of the Union
including multi-million pound
budgets. You can be a part of
that either by getting elected to
it or simply turning up to find
out what the Union is doing and
have your say.
An open door and a helping
hand
During the course of the year,
some of you may experience dif-
ficulties or feel anxious about
your course or simply be inter-
ested in finding out more about
College and the Union.
Whatever problems or ideas you
may have please remember my
door is always open so feel free
to come in and have a chat.
