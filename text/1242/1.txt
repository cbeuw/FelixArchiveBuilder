Security launched a two-day operation, in
conjuction with the police, to repel animal
rights protesters planning to disrupt activity in
the College last Monday.
Access to all buildings was to be restricted
to those holding valid College identification at
possibly the worst time of the year, before
Freshers have been allocated their swipe-
cards.
Action was taken when Security were noti-
fied that an organisation known as SHAC -
Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty - were plan-
ning to protest at Imperial on Monday and
Tuesday. The group have a reputation for
occupying buildings and contacting the media
to gain publicity for their cause.
Keith Reynolds, Head of Security, Post and
Fire Services said that 35 security officers
were used in total, seven of whom were
brought in from external security companies
and one of whom was drafted in from the
Union's stewarding team.

Freshers Fair still a success
As expected, three groups of protesters con-
verged on Imperial on Monday and while the
groups were of "relative size" according to Mr
Reynolds, they were successfully prevented
from entering the College. There was no
attempt to gain entry on Tuesday, but securi-
ty remained tight just in case.
Nona Ahamat - the Union's Deputy
President for Clubs and Societies - said she
thought Tuesday's Freshers Fair was a great
success, despite the need for Freshers to
queue up for security checks at several points
across the campus. Several thousand stu-
dents attended the event with over two hun-
dred clubs attempting to attract new recruits.
In addition to animal rights protesters, a
number of other uninvited guests appeared at
the Fair but stayed on the pavement rather
than attempting entry, including an Islamic
fundamentalist group and the Socialist
Worker.

determine who stole goods from the Senior
Common Room during last year's Summer
Ball. Anybody with information should con-

Last Orders at the Crofton
The Crofton on Queen's Gate,
famous with students for years as
a late-night venue for post-Union
drinking, has closed this week.
In a 'Bedknobs and
Broomsticks' moment, Felix
reporters investigating the sad loss
were nearly struck by flying beds
as the interior was gutted.
The front bar of the Hotel had
been popular for years with stu-
dents who weren't ready to go
home, even after Friday nights at
the Union with a lam licence.
The inflated prices and drab inte-
rior were obviously no discourage-
ment - possibly due to the relative
inebriation of the clientele.
Felix spoke to Spencer Parsons,
Hotel Manager, who said that the
closure was not due to lack of
business. Instead, the family run-
ning the business had decided to
take the opportunity sell the prop-
erty at a good price to Boston
University, concentrating instead
on other businesses.
Will Dugdale, bar expert, pro-
posed the theory that the large bar
might remain, while the rest of the
building is converted into a new
student hall. AW
