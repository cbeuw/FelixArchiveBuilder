Imperial College Caving
Club's weekend trip to
subterranean France.
We descended the cave at 5pm. It
was quite late in the day, but we
couldn't resist the temptation of a
quick beer at the restaurant an
hour back along the path. Our
shocked fellow customers were
glad to see the back of us - a
posse of neoprene-clad cavers are
not who you want to meet on a
peaceful Saturday afternoon's
stroll in the amazing scenery of
the Haute Savoie. We had divided
into two groups of 5 for the
lengthy through trip from the Tete
du Parmelan plateau to the FiI Mere
valley, 700 metres below. This
long anticipated expedition is
described as 'probably the best
caving through trip in France', and
considering the French invented
caving, it was definitely something
to look forward to.
It started, as all good ideas do,
in the pub! We were all looking for
an adventurous caving trip to do in
the Summer, so when Hugh sug-
gested this 650m through trip we
were all for it. Flights were
booked, cars were hired - a trip
was born!
Two months later, Hugh, Jan,
Tim, Goaty and I relaxed in beau-
tiful sunshine as the first group
descended the entrance shaft - an
88m drop into the heart of the
mountain. We decided to wait an
hour to allow them to clear the
first section of the cave before
starting the descent ourselves.
After a typical English Summer, it
was great to have the warm sun
beating down on us, especially in
such an inspiring limestone land-
scape. Once our skin had turned a
satisfying shade of lobster, it was
time to go. I pulled my wetsuit
over my shoulders, lobbed the
rope down the small entrance pot-
hole, and down I went. This was
my first pull-through trip, and I
was slightly nervous. A pull-
through requires the cavers to pull
the ropes down behind them in
order to use them on the next
shaft. Once the first rope is down,
there's no way back up - in effect
burning the boats. As Jan hauled
the rope to join us on the small
ledge I suddenly realised the only
way out was 16 hours and over 5
km away. We were committed!
Disaster struck nearly straight
away. At the bottom of the 88m
shaft, I leaned on the rope to pull
it down, but nothing happened. I
put all my weight on it - not a
budge. Tim came over to help, but
even under the combined weight
of the two of us, it still wouldn't
move. This was the situation we'd
all been dreading; the rope was
stuck. We had to get the rope
down, as it was needed further on
in the cave, and there was no
other way out. Tim volunteered to
ascend back up the rope to dis-
cover the problem. He quickly dis-
covered that the descent rope and
the pull-down rope had managed
to twist themselves around each
other. Tim carefully untwisted
them, then kept them well apart
as he descended again to the floor.
I once again leaned on the rope, a
slight movement, then it stuck
again, our hearts sank. But pulling
harder it soon came free and the
70m of rope toppled down on top
of me.
Another series of smaller pitch-
es led to the biggest shaft in the
cave, an exhilarating 58m free
hang dropping into a spectacular-
ly fluted chamber. A small stream
entered from a tiny passage on the
left, continuing onwards in a
channel at the bottom of a large
tunnel. We followed this in to a
huge dry passage, coated every-
where with solid mud. The next
section of the cave was just like an
adventure playground. We swung
on ropes above big drops,
whooped along enormous train-
tunnel passageway, ducked under
massive waterfalls, and eventually
ended up in the mammoth Salle
des Rhomboedres. This chamber
acts as a large collector for the
three high altitude entrances to
the Diau system. We could see
where the shorter Bel Espoir
entrance entered, but couldn't find
the way on to the bottom. Panic
ensued as we clambered all over
the colossal boulders in search of
it. Would we be stuck to wander
the Diau system forever? A huge
shout from Goaty led to relief by
all as he found the route to the
Puits des Echos, a large 39m
shaft which did, indeed, echo.
After a quick cuppa from the stove
deposited by the previous group,
we followed the water onwards.
We had now entered the
Affluent de Grenoblois, a large
streamway passage with glisten-
ing walls: the stone seemed to be
reflecting our lights back at us.
The many small drops and water-
falls adding to the excitement in
the best bit of passage I've ever
seen. We sped onwards and
downward in this winding passage
- with everyone enjoying the route.
It must have been past 3 in the
morning, but the cave was too fas-
cinating for anyone to notice.
A slowing and deepening of
water indicated that the conflu-
ence with the Diau streamway
was fast approaching, and though
