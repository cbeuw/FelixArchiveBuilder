Hello campers. How are we all
today? While it may be Friday for
you lot, for me (due to the magic
of printing deadlines) it is still
Tuesday evening, so the Freshers
Fair is still hot in my mind. Firstly
I would like to say thank you to Al
(for the second week in a row) for
his help today, and second I
would like to say thanks to every-
one who showed an interest in
Felix: you should have received e-
mails by now, and for anyone that
hasn't, or for anyone that didn't
manage to find us and get their
names down, please e-mail me so
that I can contact you next week
some time.
While on the subject of Freshers
Fair, I have had several arguments
today with several clever-clogses
(if that's a plural) on the subject of
apostrophes. Now, just to put the
record straight, I realise that if it is
the Week/Fair of Freshers, then
yes, there is an apostrophe:
Freshers' Fair. However, Felix (i.e.
me) believes that it is a week that
consists of Freshers, as in AIDS
Week, or Fish Week. None of
which have them. So don't write
any bloody letters complaining
basically.
Anyway, I'm in the middle of
sending out the e-mails, but
tonight is deadline night, so you
can imagine my joy and rapture at
considering the heady time at
which I will get to rest my head.
Actually, to be honest, it's only
lam, and I think we should be fin-
ished by 2. Banter! As they say.
But if you lot were helping, then I
would have been home and asleep
by now, so get over here now. Not
that you can right now, obviously,
but you see my point.
Hmmm. Kind of run out of
things to say, actually. This some-
times happens at this time of
night, I'm afraid, but you'll get
used to it if you ever read this on
a regular basis. In fact, so lazy and
tired am I feeling, that I'm going to
give this up for a bad job, and say
see you next week instead.
I've just noticed that this leaves
me with rather a large empty
space left to fill, so now I'm going
to scare you all with a huge pic-
ture of me looking cheeky, or so
my mother would claim. G'night.
