This long-awaited return from
London's finest girl group grabs
you right from the start. It's an
amalgamation of everything,
orchestra, electronica, RnB,
dance and pop. They show you
the almost impossible, that Gary
Numan's music, can be blended
successfully with Adina Howard's
lyrics, and not sound compro-
mised. This is 'Freak Like Me', the
relatively inaccessible first single.
The progression of electronica
verses RnB, with an augmented
bassline allows the downbeat
verse to progress to the honeyed
chorus in 'Blue', where we hear
the babes rapping for the first
time of many. The good times
roll on with current single, the
dance-pop good times of
Motown's girl groups with mod-
ern-day attitude convinces the
listener that these girls are no
flash in the pan. 'Round,
Round', is a pop gem, the first of
many on this impressively
accomplished, self-written
album.
'Stronger', reminiscent of
Neneh Cherry on a good day,
shifts its way through a darkly
optimistic verse, to a somewhat
disappointing samey, yet
strangely apt chorus. The mid-
dle eight is eerily copied and
pasted from Neneh's 'Woman'
which, with it's sparse string
quartet backing to crescendo,
improves the song dramatically.
No time is spared - the funk and
breathy sass of 'Supernatural'
squiggles its way with a pared-
down rap that the Spice Girls
would have killed for! Even
Garage gets a look in on the
comparatively weak title track,
which along with 'Virgin, Virgin
Sexy' highlights the downside of
the album - lots of identikit
tracks, where the girls attempt
to sing unconvincingly about
issues they seem to have been
through.

5/5
For the benefit of the ignorant, the
favoured track off each of the
shortlisted albums for this presti-
gious prize is taken and stuck on
this compilation, which gives us
an idea of what's supposedly hot,
and what's supposedly not.
Miss Dynamite's It Takes More,
that is socially-conscious, sophis-
ticated pop to you and me, kicks
off proceedings in it's rich, rootsy
groove, which entices the listener
smoothly into the Doves mega hit
There Goes The Fear, which
again, is very good. The elder
statesman of pop, David Bowie,
makes a timely appearance, with
Slow Burn. Social conciousness
seems to be the order of the day,
and I'm itching to hear something
less demanding of the listener.
Don't get me wrong, Slow Burn
Bowie, and his trumpet and tam-
bourine led pop is very well put
together, but I'm now in the mood
for decadent fluff. And soulful,
strum-along fluff is what I am
given, in the shape of Beverley
Knight's hit, Shoulda Woulda
Coulda. The compilers have got it
right this time, and I'll admit now,
that I want Beverley Knight to win
the prize. Intelligent, beautiful and
talented, having waited a long
time for her much deserved suc-
cess, I can't think of a better win-
ner from the list.
Rap hip-hop outfit, Roots
Manuva, bring a British Flavour to
what essentially sounds like a
melting pot of Warren G and
Spooks. Their darkly infectious
melody is a perfect prelude to The
Coral's psychadelic, yet endearing
indie rock. The other inclusions
are:- The Electric Soft Parade, Guy
Barker and his instrumental jazz
crew, the Streets with his percep-
tive observations, Irish folkster
Gemma Hayes, the useless cod-
reggae of the Bees, and the equal-
ly useless yet talented pianist
Joanna MacGregor. Thankfully,
last years winner, PJ Harvey, with
the excellent, emotive, This Is
Love, shows us what a true winner
is made of, as she closes what is
definitely an excellent show.
Singles
Simian - Never Be Alone
The keyboard's range of func-
tions (glockenspiel, layered
chords and space noises) is put
to good use on this optimistic
offering from Matt Bellamy's
vocal second coming. Angsty,
forceful vocals, and, that key-
board aside, there isn't much
more to this prog-influenced
piece of art. And in the humble
opinion of the great unwashed
masses, modern art = wank,
right?
Rating - 2/5
U2 - Electrical Storm
The suggestion of William Orbit
on the radio edit braces me for
Pop part two - i.e. U2 trying to
do dance in an inimitable way.
Expecting a rush of beats, I was
pleasantly surprised by Bono's
ruggedly angelic vocals, and
the band's trademark contem-
plative guitar sound being
accentuated more clearly than
before, which is definitely a
good thing and unfortunately,
reduces my curiosity for the
new Orbit-produced Blur
album. Done to the high stan-
dards generally expected of U2,
it is unfortunate that the origi-
nality often associated with
them is sadly lacking.
Rating - 3/5
Turin Brakes - Long Distance
Mercury Music Prize nominated
|duo return with what they know
to do best. The plaintive, old-
fashioned strum-alongs with
ush orchestral backing. Ollie's
expressive vocals sit comfort-
ably with his incisive lyrics, on
top of a perky piano part and a
tambourine. Fortunately, the
vocals set him apart from other
|jazz-influenced combos, and
save him the shame (oh the
(shame!) of sounding like
Toploader.
