Get UR Freak On
4/5
Billed as '38 of the sexiest RnB
grooves', your reviewer, (a dedi-
cated RnB hater), approached
this CD hoping to have her eyes
opened to a collection of top
tunes, wishing to be convinced,
like the majority of people these
days, that RnB is indeed all
that!
10 Garage MCs minus the
right to vote and drink open the
show, with their number one
massacre of an old Rap stan-
dard, Crossroads. That's the
Blazin' Squad for you, and that's
enough of them for now, the less
said the better. They're thankful-
ly followed by the sweet, sassy,
attitude packed tunes of the
bluesy, rich vocals of Tweet, the
improbably beautiful Ashanti,
with the excellent Foolish and J-
Lo. I'm Gonna be Alright is a
definite highlight, with it's atti-
tude packed delivery and rap
from the 'Stillmatic' Nas.
The transition to what I don't
like, i.e. mush, occurs rather
abruptly, with Jaheim's Heaven
in My Eyes, the strained and
almost perverted lyrics Feenin
by the ever-ageing Jodeci mak-
ing me reach out for the sick
bucket. Graphic enough for you?
Well to add insult to injury, add
Keith Sweat's Twisted, another
bland, insipid ballad, Levert
Sweat Gill's narcissistic Your
Body and Wayne Marshall's Your
G Spot with it's tacky imagery
and calculated breathing exer-
cises, just compounds my dread
of listening to the rest of the CD.
Thankfully Craig David and
Damage come to the rescue,
with the smoochy Rendezvous
and the jazz-laden, smoky After
the Love Has Gone. Unknown
Americans, the White Head
Brothers are also a welcome
addition, with their groovy,
slinky and sexy You're Love is a
187. Take note Jodeci - This is
how a sexy RnB groove should
be done! Shola Ama and En
Vogue redeem CD1 with a much
needed touch of class with the
funky You're the One I Love and
Motown-esque Supremes style
Giving Him Something He Can
Feel. This is indeed pop at its
very best, and puts me in a very
good mood for CD2.
And the good mood carries on,
with the ground-breaking Missy
Elliot and the bhangra/hip-hop
clubbing tune - Get UR Freak
On, this song being so good I
don't want it to end! Brandy and
Fat Joe carry on the good work
with Full Moon and to top off a
trio of top tunes, Adina
Howard's funky, yet alluring
Freak Like Me. If you think you
don't know it, yes you do! You
know this one, the tune where
the Sugababes stole the lyrics
and put it over the Gary Numan
sample to make their decidedly
inferior cover! Again, the transi-
tion to the slow songs occurs,
but less rapidly so, but with
equally perverted songs! I count
Gerald Levert, D'Angelo,
Another Level and Mark
Morrison among the guilty par-
ties. Thankfully the worst is
over. Highlights to close include
Next's Too Close, Angie Stone's
jazz and smoke in No More Rain
and Sunshine Anderson's soulful
Lunch or Dinner.
So what the unashamed popa-
holic learn from this exercise?
That this CD is a useful summa-
tion of the recent past of RnB
with tracks dating back to
1993. That with all genres of
music, there's the good, the bad
and the ugly....
And you'll never guess what?
Twelve bad tracks, versus twen-
ty-six tolerable to excellent,
means that I for one am defi-
nitely coming back for more. A
convert is born!
Matthew
Everybody Down
4/5
Everybody Down explodes with
thick guitar melodies and hooky
alternative rock songs brimming
with youthful agitation, passion,
and solid musicianship... wield-
ing as much drama and emotion
as three-minute plus modern pop
song can handle. That's the All
Music Guide's description of
Matthew, and I have to agree
with them there on the title track:
a feel good, thought-provoking,
introspective singalong of the
highest order. The rest of the
album carries on in the much
same order; high quality, learned
musicianship, the emotive vocals
carrying the questions asked
effectively. Highlights include
This Time, In Your Car and Led
Zep's younger brother, Streams.
The lows? Well there are no lows,
as this is one hot scorcher of a
summer album!

Review
Yer pays yer money and yer
takes your choice.
Musically, festivals are about
crackling live performances
from all your favourite bands,
plus the chance to check the
hype on the new boys.
Financially, it's the marketplace
of the industry, where the labels
get to show their wares - estab-
lished acts and newcomers
jostling all year for position on
the bill, in pursuit of that all-
important exposure. Careers are
made and broken at festivals, so
bands have to shine or stink;
the only bad reaction is no reac-
tion....
Shame Gomez haven't got the
script, then. The lardy stoner's
band of choice look positively
bored. And so do we. At their
best, Gomez can be magical,
but if I want to see a bunch of
fat chemistry students half-
heartedly floundering through
recycled blues riffs, I'll go down
the union.
Of course, a sure fire way to
draw attention is to smash, bite,
throw or spit on whatever you
can. The Pete Townsend Award
for Wanton Destruction goes to:-
Dillinger Escape Plan
The frontman of Epitaph
Records' newest punk sensation
shat into a towel before throw-
ing it to the audience. The kids
decided to look this particular
gift horse in the mouth, and
threw the towel back; the
singer, unimpressed smeared it
over the PA cabs for good meas-
ure. Pleasant.
Close behind... Trail Of Dead.
After a cracking set, the Texans
fling their drumsticks to the
crowd - followed by the entire
kit, piece by piece. Catching a
stick is one thing, cushioning
the landing of a kickdrum's
maiden flight is quite another
