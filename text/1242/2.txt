PopStars at Imperial
E
In case you haven't heard, Colleges
across London were overrun by
celebrity action this summer. The
chief culprit was Imperial, where
filming took place for the finals of
Popstars: The Rivals.
The series, which has been aired
on ITV from Saturday 7th
September, follows on from the
highly successful Popstars series of
last year. The winners of that com-
petition became the band Hear'Say
and released a clutch of top 20 sin-
gles, including No.l hit 'Pure And
Simple' and a Top 5 album.
However, in an ingenious (or grue-
some, take your pick) twist, the
final winners of this competition will
share a house for two weeks while
viewers vote to decide who should
leave.
Although the contestants them-
selves were banned from speaking
to the press (including London
Student) a spokesperson from
Granada Media, which is producing
the show, said, "we are very happy
to be at Imperial. The reception has

been fantastic and everyone is very
helpful."
In other celeb spotting fun, the
Foo Fighters were seen around ULU
on Friday 30th August, ahead of
their post-Reading wind-down date
there. The band are set to release a
new album, 'lxl', described as
"the most aggressive yet" by front-
man and ex-Nirvana drummer Dave
Grohl, sometime in September.
Sightings of celebrity judges Geri
Halliwell and presenter Davina
McCall also aroused excitement
around the Imperial campus,
although one eyewitness described
the pint-sized ex-spice girl as "a bit
shorter and more minging than on
TV". Not that they were shallow or
anything. Joe Parker
