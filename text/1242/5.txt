we all thought the cave had been
brilliant so far, we didn't know the
best was yet to come. The Diau
cave occupies a 5m diameter pas-
sage with a large, gentle river
flowing through it. This area of
cave exposed another character to
the all-encompassing trip: big pas-
sages, winding canyons, and now
tubular river-passage. This cave
had it all. We progressed easily
along the tunnel, the water only
knee-high, when we came across
a large chamber with a tent in the
corner. This area had been used
as a base-camp by the original
cave-explorers. They had explored
the cave from the bottom up, with
the high entrances only discovered
by intensive searching. We had
our feed of noodles and Mars bars
before pressing on in the cascad-
ing passage. The deeper sections
of cave had wire ropes strung
across the side. We clipped in and
easily pulled ourselves over the
water. Jan and I zoomed off, being
eager to explore this fascinating
passage. It was only after we wait-
ed 10 minutes for the others to
catch up that we realised there
were problems. Goaty's acetylene
light had failed early on, and he'd
been using his electric back-up for
much of the cave. That eventually
ran out, and he was now on his
spare electric, which was dim-
ming rapidly. I lent him my spare
electric - enough light to exit the
cave, but not much more than
that. This had slowed him down
considerably, so we decided to
stick together so he could cave by
our lights.
The water was getting deeper
now, with the strong current rush-
ing past us. At one point we had a
brief swim across a chamber, but
we were still going strong and a
quick look at the map indicated
there wasn't far to go. Much
encouraged, we stormed along the
passage, leaving the river behind.
We clambered down ladders,
shuffled along thin ledges, waded
through waist-deep pools before a
glint of daylight could be seen in
the distance. It was 9am and we
were back in the French country-
side. I couldn't wait to strip off my
wetsuit to bask in the sun once
again, and the others followed
likewise. Paul, from the previous
group, was waiting with warm
croissants and fine French coffee.
We collapsed in the back of the
car and returned to the campsite
where we quickly sorted the gear
before falling into a deep sleep.
The excellent Sunday lunch of
endless beef and lamb eaten in
the magical village of Thorens-
Glieres topped off an excellent end
to an excellent year's caving.
If you want to experience the
delights of the subterranean
world, visit foreign countries and
be the first person to explore new
passageways, the caving club is
for you. We run freshers trips
throughout the first term - but
don't worry, they're not all as
hard-core as the Diau trip. Contact
us on caving@ic.ac.uk, visit our
website: union.ic.ac.uk/caving, or
come to our introductory slide
shows at 5pm on Thursday 3rd
and Tuesday 8th October in the
Table Tennis Room of the main
Union Building in Beit Quad.
