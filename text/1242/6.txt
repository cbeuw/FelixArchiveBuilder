Ferry, Chunnel
We did it! These are the three
words that I have been waiting a
long time to write and there were
times along the 22.5miles that I
doubted I would ever get to put
them down. It took us 14hrs
16min to get from Dover to
Sangatte (and no we didn't bring
back any refugees). Our course
was far from simple as the tide
sent us in anything but a straight
line. However, we kept swimming
in roughly the right direction until
we made it, exhausted.
For those of you who haven't
read my previous articles the
principle of the relay channel
swim is to get from England to
France with a team of 6 swim-
mers, unaided (no wet suits or
armbands), while following a lit-
tle fishing boat. Each swimmer
completes an hour and then tags
the next swimmer and this con-
tinues until dry land is reached.
The IC Cross Channel Swim Team
consisted of: Crazy Fish (Emma
Williams cpt), Fast Fish (Rebecca
Herbert), Jelly Fish (Jessica
Taylor), Dr. Fish (Caroline Coats),
Welsh Fish (Emma Loyd Davis)
and Boy Fish (me). We were well
supported by our reserve Rescue
Fish (Catherine Lawrence) and
HotChocolate Fish (Rosie
Herbert) without whom the trip
would have been almost impossi-
ble. The names which each of us
wore with pride on our hoodies
were inspired by a certain team
member's unorthodox ability to
catch JellyFish and we thought
we would keep the fish theme
going. Special thanks must go to
CoachFish (Nick Adams) without
whose advice, encouragement
and poor sense of humour we
would never had made it.
The day of the swim started
with a 2:15am wakeup call. After
meeting up in Putney we set off
for Dover. Arriving at the marina
just after 5:30am we loaded the
essentials onto the boat - lots of
chocolate and crisps, a stereo
and some beer for after the swim
(I think I bought slightly too
much beer). Having had team
photos taken we dropped
FastFish onto the beach at 6:30
and the stopwatch started. She
lived up to her name and com-
pleted 2 and a quarter miles. It
was a hot day even at this ungod-
ly time in the morning and the
sea temperature was almost trop-
ical being 18Â°C most of the way
(compared to what we had
trained in this was boiling). The
rest of us took our turn and we
reached half way with a project-
ed time of around lOhrs.
Unfortunately the change of tide
took its toll and all the stamina
built up from two-hour training
swims in Dover started to pay off.
We all coped with the boredom of
swimming for an hour non-stop,
however no amount of training
could have prepared us for being
on that damned boat for so long.
The small boat was bobbing
along at the same speed as the
swimmer; it hit every peak and
trough and it danced around in
the wash from almost every other
boat in the channel. To be honest
I think that most of us found the
swimming part a bit of relief from
the constant seasickness. Poor
CrazyFish suffered more than
most and having become
ChunderFish after her first swim
she was very brave to get back in
for a second. Many of us were
dreading the thought of the
schools of jellyfish that we would
inevitably encounter. It was
WelshFish who bore the brunt of
the little pink critters. She swam
through them with the minimum
of fuss and appeared not to even
notice the stings as she emerged
back onto the boat. I on the other
hand managed to hit a floating
plastic bag and thinking it was a
jellyfish jumped nearly 10ft in
the air; the Welsh are a tough
breed!
As darkness drew in the coast
of France started to become visi-
ble; the finish was in site!
Unfortunately the tides again
played their part in making the
crossing a difficult one as we

started to be pushed towards
Calais. It became a race to get to
the shallow water, where we
could fight the tide and were safe
from the incessant bombardment
of the ferries. At this point there
was a real possibility of the swim
being abandoned due to the dan-
gers of the shipping lane, the
encroaching shipwrecks and the
rapidly setting in darkness. Being
on the boat started to get even
more testing as we encountered
more and more wash and for the
one in the water each hour
became a sprint. As the tides
grew stronger we made less
headway towards the coast and
drifted ever closer to Calais. It
soon became clear that the first
three swimmers would be called
upon for a third time. FastFish,
DrFish and JellyFish would have
to do the business if we were to
make the day worthwhile. They
did not disappoint, despite the
wind picking up and the air tem-
perature dropping. As DrFish
entered the water it had become
too dark to see her properly so
the green glow sticks were
attached and off she went. As
she got out it was pitch black but
the shore was less than a mile off
and we were in shallow water.
We knew that we had done it but
it took JellyFish to set off on a
dash for land.
The unpredictable nature of the
journey did not stop there, as we
negotiated our way past the ship
wrecks just off of the coast. The
dinghy that JellyFish was to fol-
low to the shore wouldn't start.
Unperturbed JellyFish just kept
going being guided by the reflec-
tion of the moon on the water
(romantic it wasn't). With the
wave of a glow stick we could see
she had made dry land. All of us
were now officially channel
swimmers and we joined a list
headed by Captain Webb who
first swam the Channel in 22hrs
back in 1875. JellyFish sped
back to the boat in the dingy,
which had now decided to work,
and was greeted to the sound of
Queen's "We are the Champions."
We may not have been the fastest
team to ever cross the channel
but we were all determined and
this is the most basic element of
channel swimming. Having had a
beer each (this was the most any
of us could stomach) we set sail
for England.
The journey home was relative-
ly uneventful and much
smoother. The boat cruised
through the water and it took
about three and a half-hours to
get back. During this time a bit of
cramped sleeping was grabbed
before we headed back to
London. As I passed through
Wimbledon on the way back to
my bed at 2:30am I saw some
friends which I had seen being
thrown out of the same club
24hours previously. The day
before they had told me that we
were all mad, probably true but
everyone on that boat managed
to achieve something that six
months earlier we would have
laughed at the thought of! The
bets are on as to who will be
crazy enough to go for a solo. I
know who my money is on!
I would like to end by thanking
everyone who has supported the
swim especially the Harlington
Trust who put a substantial sum
towards the cost of the boat, the
MDU who contributed towards
the cost of the team outfits and
all those who have given money
in sponsorship and at fundrais-
ers. This money will all be given
to the Paediatric Physiotherapy
Department at Hammersmith
Hospital for the purpose of pur-
chasing new equipment. My final
thanks goes to my group of girls
who made the whole channel
swimming experience, yes even
the Serpentine swims, enjoyable.
