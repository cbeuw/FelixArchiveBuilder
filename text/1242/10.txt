What up sketchballls! I'm back again for one more year of piss-tak-
ing puzzlery and useless drivel to fill these empty, lifeless pages.
But there's one big difference fudge-packers, this year I need your
help, and quick. The end, dear friends, is nigh. This time next year
I'll have been packed up and sent off to Alabama to spend the twi-
light of my life in the Liberace Memorial Trailer Park with my life-
partner Bruce the Goat. Plus I really can't be arsed having to write
crosswords in my final year, especially now that me and Bobby C
are spreading our wings and providing three generous pages of cof-
fee break. So what I want is somebody, anybody, to start writing
crosswords. I don't care how shite they are, I'll print them (the
more vulgar the better by the way). Mummy Huffwell will be writ-
ing regularly of course, but this ship requires more crew to keep it
on a steady course. So get your arses in gear and write some cryp-
tic crosswords to puzzle your pals and flabbergast your foes!
In other news, we have a grand prize to give away again this
year. I don't know what the crossword prize will be yet, but if
you're new to this game, last year we gave away a PS2 to the win-
ner of the crossword competition and this year's prize will be of
that ilk. All you have to do is bring your answers into the office (it's
in the Beit Quad West Wing basement) or send them to
coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk. At the end of the year I'll put all the correct
entries into a tombola and draw out one lucky winner, so obvious-
ly the more times you enter the better your chances of winning.
Well that's all for now folks, try to enjoy your first week back in this
dump, or if you're a fresher, in the words of Nelson Muntz, Ha-ha!
