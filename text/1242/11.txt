GFQQ LEADER BOARD
W A T C H T H I S S P A C E
Welcome once more to your friendly neighbourhood quote quiz. Yes
folks, you guessed it, GFQQ is back. To those 'freshers' who don't yet
know the rules, let me explain. Each week we will provide quotes from
our favourite movies and you have to guess what they are. Half a point
is awarded for the actor/character and half for the movie the quote is
taken from. A bonus point will be awarded to those clever-clogs who
guess all of the quotes correctly. Each week the leaderboard will be
printed here and at the end of the year the winner gets a prize. Send
your answers as usual to coffee.felix@ic.ac.uk or drop them in to the
office (directions are on the other page).
ACHTIJNG!
