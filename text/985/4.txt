Bfll 'n' Ted 'n' Aliens from ICSF
ICSF begins its programme of video projected
double bills on Monday in the Chem Eng lecture
theatre 1 at 6pm.
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, as if you
didn't already know, stars Alex Winter (The
Lost Boys) and Keanu Reeves as a pair of
Californian airheads who must go through
Earth's past in a time machine so that they don't
fail a history exam in the present in order to be
able to save the world with their embarrassingly
horrific music in the future. On the way, they
bump into Napoleon, Beethoven, So-crates and a
pair of English princess babes.
The even funnier sequel, Bill and Ted's
Bogus Journey (at 7.45pm), has the dastardly
and very camp Joss Ackland trying to impose
his evil order on the world using a pair of robot
Bill and Teds after killing the real ones. Will
Bill and Ted be able to enlist the help of Death
to save the world yet again? Come and find out
at 6pm. Entry to both films is free to ICSF and
JapanSoc members and ICSF membership costs
just £3, giving you free entry to our full pro-
gramme of video projected double bills, the
chance to borrow over 3,000 books, videos and
graphic novels from our library in the corner of
Beit Quad. You also get reduced entry to our
35mm presentations.
On Tuesday, we offer our Alien binge: Alien
(widescreen) at 5.30pm, Giger's Alien at
7.30pm, Alien3
(widescreen) at 8pm and The
Making of Alien3
at 10pm. The two films need
little introduction, but the documentaries are
somewhat rarer; Giger's Alien is Alien beastie
designer H R Giger's video of the film's produc-
tion from his mad Swiss artist point of view
while The Making of Alien3
is a more commer-
cial behind the scenes look at, surprisingly,
Alien3
.
The Aliens start bursting at 5.30pm in the
Table Tennis Room (top floor, Union Building).
Entry is free to ICSF and JapanSoc members.
Next film screening is Robocop on Tuesday.
