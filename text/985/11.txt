Welcome back to
Imperial, we hope that
you all had a great
Christmas and an even
better New Year. The
New Year brings a whole
host of superb promotions
from DaVinci's. Firstly,
we are offering a burger
plus a bottle of beer for
only £2, that's loads less
than the combined price.
Just cut out the voucher
opposite and hand it in
when you pay for your
meal. If you like this one,
we might try other
combinations, if you've
got any suggestions let us
know. The Cocktail
Nights have proved so
popular, (could it be down
to Dan, our cocktail
supremo?) we are going
to have one every
Thursday. We're still
going to keep those great
prices and expand our
range. Another good
piece of news is that our
Happy Hours will
continue, 7-8pm every
day, except Friday when
it is from 8pm to 9pm.
Remember that's 20% off|
all drinks! We've also
tinkered with the tellys,
from now on we'll be
showing the Cartoons
during the day and MTV
during the evenings,
except when we're
showing football, rugby
or one of many sporting
fixtures. f
