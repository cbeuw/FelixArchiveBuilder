National Science Week
BY LYNN BRAVEY
"Science is fun!" is the message
being promoted by Science
Minister William Waldegrave in a
new Government campaign. The
campaign is designed to increase
public awareness on science,
engineering and technology with
the primary aim to encourage more
children to participate in science-
based activities at school.
One of the main public
initiatives for this year is the
National Week of Science,
Engineering and Technology,
called Set 7, which begins on 18th
March 1994. Events are being held
nationwide and according to
Mr.Waldegrave the week is
targeting "teachers, media, scien-
tists, engineers and above all young
people". Over 250 events have
already been planned with a wide
range of activities taking place such
as talks, exhibitions, 'hands on'
displays and the Science Museum
are holding a sleepover.
Commenting on the huge
interest in the National Science
Week, M r . Waldegrave said:
"Everyone will have the oppor-
tunity to see something of the
excitement and importance of
William Waldegrave, Science Minister
science, engineering and tech-
nology during the week.
The Set 7 programme will show
how vital science, engineering and
technology is to our culture and
economy.
The campaign follows national
concern over school children
dropping science subjects in
preference to the Arts.

GETSET!

340 thirteen year old girls are set to
descend upon Imperial College as
part of National Science Week. The
event, entitled G E T S E T (Girls
Entering Tomorrow's Science,
Engineering and Technology), is a
residential experience for girls
taking place on the 21st and 22nd
March.
During the two days they will be
given a series of science challenges
supported by female mentors who
are either scientists and engineers.
The projects have been designed
by CREST (Creativity in Science
and Technology) in conjunction
with Johnny Ball, the popular
children's television presenter of
science and technology pro-
grammes who has been asked to
attend the event.
Research has shown that year 9
(13 year olds) is a critical time since
it is when girls are most likely to
lose interest in the physical
sciences.
GETSET aims to change this.
Schools Liaison Officer, Melanie
Thody, said the event would be
"fun and exciting with activities
taking place largely in the Great
Hall". The event should also attract
a good positive image for Imperial
College which already has a world
famous reputation for its work in
science, technology, engineering
and medicine along with its
disproportionate number of women
students.
Imperial College is also
involved in the B A Y S (British
Association of Young Scientists)
days. These days will have a packed
programme of events including
displays, exhibitions and presen-
tations. It is hoped that Science
Minister, William Waldegrave, will
be present to open the event, though
currently the organising committee
are still in the planning stages.
Deadline for submission of letters is 6pm, Monday
