Does anyone seriously make new year resolu-
tions any more? I gave up years ago because I
could never keep them. No matter how hard I
tried, things like keeping my room tidy or doing
all my homework before I sat down and watched
TV never lasted more than a week or two. There
must be some people out there who make new
year resolutions and actually stick to them for
the whole year. Surely we can't all be that weak-
willed?! I've yet to come across anyone who
has, though.
So why do we make such a big deal about
making resolutions? We make them all the time.
Starting anything new means we try to do it the
best we can or at least a bit better than before. I
can remember every time I started a new
exercise book at school, I would always vow to
keep my writing neat all the way through. But
the further I got through the book the worse the
writing it got. Every now and again it would
become neater again, but it never lasted.
Arts Magazine
Editor Wanted
Dear Beccy,
Every year, Phoenix (the Arts magazine of
ICU) is published and an editor is elected to
produce it at the start of this term. The job
involves editing any suitable material (stories,
pictures, photographs etc) by the students of IC,
putting it together into a magazine and getting it
printed (ICU provides a budget).
If this appeals to you, sign your name on the
papers opposite the Union Office and get a
proposer and five seconders to do the same, then
turn up to the Publications Board meeting on
Friday 21st January at 6.08pm in the Brown
Committee Room (top floor of the Union
building) for the elections.
If you want to know more, pop into IC Radio
and talk to Greg lies or see Beccy Land in the
Felix Office.

I've tried to change things at other times, like
at the start of a new college year or a new term
or a new lecture course (back to the neat writing
again), but I've failed every time. M y problem
sheets would never get done and my lab reports
would be left to the last possible moment. I
always have such good intentions to start off
with, but other things are more tempting and
they become even more so the more important
the work is. I've lost count of the number of
times I've tidied my room or done the washing
up instead of revising for an exam and they are
always things I would avoid doing like the
plague under normal circumstances.
That was sort of how I got so heavily
involved in Felix. I don't mean that I would
normally have avoided the Felix Office, but I did
spend a large amount of time there when I
should have been studying. But Felix had much
more appeal than Quantum Mechanics or
Particle Physics, surprisingly enough.

Dear Beccy,
Happy New Year!!!
In case you thought that Rag dies a death
after Christmas we would like to anounce this
week's events:
We have a collection at the Royal Albert
Hall on Friday night (tonight) at the Sting

Anyone interested should come to the Rag

Lynn Bravey Thanks to everyone who
Michael Ingram collated the final issue
Mark Simmons last term. I made a note
of your names but Vve
Features: temporarily misplaced
Owain Bennallack (Ed) the bit of paper. I'll try
Kin Wei Lee tofind itfor next week.
I got so used to spending so much time in
Felix that it was almost impossible to break the
habit. But I did learn a lot about how the issues
were put together which has proved invaluable
this year. I also saw the mistakes that were made
and hopefully I've managed to avoid making the
same ones this year.
When I started as Editor, I made some
resolutions. I wanted to make Felix better than
before, not just the content, but the running of
the office as well. I found that some of the ideas
I had were impractical, some I haven't got round
to implementing yet and some I failed to keep.
But at least I can pass some of it on to whoever
is voted in as next year's Editor.
That reminds me - elections for all the
sabbatical posts (President, DP (Finance and
Services), DP (Clubs and Societies) and Felix
Ed), as well as a few other Union posts, are
taking place later this term. Look out for some
articles in the next few weeks telling you more.
