Clubs and Societies 5
Subterranean Campsite Blues
Three Imperial men in a soggy sleeping bag and porridge shocker!
And so it came down to weight...or rather lack of
it. The plan - devised by the largest and heaviest
member of the club - was to spend the night at
an underground camp in a pleasant cave in the
French Vercors.
"The volunteers for this experience will be
the first members of IC Caving Club to complete
such an exercise and in doing so will command
the awe and respect of the rest of the club," said
Jim, followed by a chorus of "Crap!",
"Bullsh*t!!"...etc. This method of recruiting
volunteers was clearly not going to succeed. So
the selection reverted to choosing those who'd
suffer most in the humid 4-8°C temperatures of
these caves. I was chosen for my lack of body
fat, Richard Moon for the same reason and Mark
Evans was picked because he'd lived in Hong
Kong all year and so he wouldn't be accustomed
to the cold.
All three of us had ventured down the Gour
Fumant on the first day of the summer tour and
had left it rigged since then. The plan was to
take our sleeping gear and dump it at the camp,
at the foot of the fourth pitch - sufficiently far
into the cave to dispel any ideas of an escape to
the comfort and delights of the Girl Guide Camp
situated just three miles down the road from the
cave entrance. Once we had decided on the
underground campsite, we were to venture
through a meandering passage and enter, via a
series of short climbs, The Chinese Dragon - a
most impressive chamber filled with turquoise
pools and excellent formations.
Each of us had one tackle bag in which to
carry our gear, which
was typically one
Karrimat, one very thin
sleeping bag, one spare
furry suit, socks and
a survival bag (the
thick polythene type).
Between the three of us
we carried two stoves:
a Trangia and an
unknown brand of
unknown quality (both
were fuelled by meths).
The food was de-
hydrated: three dried
meals and enough
porridge to feed an
army.
Approaching 10pm
on the chosen evening,
Dave Mountain com-
pleted the drive to the
cave in record time.
Then, with the tail
lights of the van
disappearing into the gloom of dusk and the
thought of the rest of the team becoming drunk
back at the campsite, we got into our kit. We
reached the entrance to the Gour Fumant just as
the stars began to shine in the clear night sky.
This was my third venture into this cave in as
many days and, as always, confidence builds
with acquaintance of one's surroundings. So
much so that the fourth pitch was nearly
descended without using any rope. It was at the
foot of this pitch that we left our sleeping gear.
To reach the meander
that led to the Chinese
Dragon we descended a
further pitch. At the
bottom of this we met
our friendly double
riggers: two men and a
woman, quite local
(from about 50 miles
away) who had come
down for the evening.
A l l had to go to work
the next day and since
it was now approaching
midnight, the prospect
of a night at our
underground camp
seemed not to appeal to
them. By the time we
reappeared from the
meander they were
gone. We had the cave
to ourselves.
of collisions ensued which left us in a pile
uncomfortably close to the 16m final pitch we'd
de-rigged earlier.
The hours passed slowly. Sleep, after the first
hour, proved elusive. While my undersuit was
merely damp, the survival bag proved to be such
a barrier to moisture
that the condensation
that had formed now
soaked my thin sleep-
ing bag, rendering it
almost useless. By 6am
I'd had enough and
decided to light a
candle.
"Are you wet?"
asked Mark, making it
perfectly clear that he
too had suffered an
uncomfortable night in
a wet sleeping bag.
Even with a dry furry
suit, the body produced
enough moisture to
soak a sleeping bag
within a polythene one.
Richard, on the other
hand, had had a
comfortably dry night

FUMANT
Food was the first priority and was prepared
in no time. The shepherd's pie was okay, the
chilli cone carne passable, but, with too much
water added, the beef bourginon had to be
thrown away. It wasn't even a substitute for
soup. M a r k ' s tiny
stove worked well but
took 2-3 minutes to
warm up. After a brew
it was time to find
somewhere to sleep.
Unfortunately there
was no flat ground on
the boulder strewn
floor, so we made do
with a bedding plane
leading off the cham-
ber via a rift in the
ceiling. Once in a
horizontal position
there was barely twelve
inches between one's
nose and the roof, so
movement was severe-
ly hampered.
"What happens if I
awake with a
stonker?", Mark asked
poignantly, "I could be
stuck here indefi-
nitely." "Don't flatter yourself," came the reply
in unison.
Once inside both sleeping bag and survival
bag, it was impossibly difficult to stop slipping
down the slope and, as I was at the top, a series
having removed his survival bag almost
immediately. The lesson was clear. Find
somewhere dry to bivi or, if that is impossible,
use a breathable bivi-bag.
Throughout the night, the thought of warm
porridge was what kept me going. This porridge
was to be one of James Evans' inventions. The
oats, dried milk and sugar were all mixed in the
correct proportions in the same bag and
instructions, simple enough even for cooks down
a cave were inscribed on a sticky label on the
side: "Add five cups of water," it said, "then
heat." We did so, but unfortunately didn't take
into account the expanding nature of the stuff as
it soaked up the water. With too much to eat, we
tried to dispose of the stuff in the trickle that was
a stream, but it soon blocked the flow and was of
such consistency that I'm sure it will still be
somewhere in that cave to this day.
None of us had previously noted the laxative
effect of a good bowl of porridge, but all were
suffering now with no toilet roll (but who needs
that anyway?) and a great desire to leave the
cave as we'd found it, at least until we reached
the woods by the entrance.
As we lay in the sun absorbing the warmth,
the van arrived; its occupants were sporting a
fair hangover, which is a normal state of affairs
at 10am, whether in Yorkshire, Derbyshire, the
Mendips or the Vercors. Unless, of course,
you'd spent the night underground.
