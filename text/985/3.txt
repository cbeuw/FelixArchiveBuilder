College Slams ICU President
College rejects Imperial College Union's constitution as
President misleads students
BY MARK SIMMONS
AND ANDREW TSENG
A letter leaked to Felix has
confirmed fears that Andrew
Wensley, I C U President, has
misled students at Imperial.
The letter from Peter Mee, the
College Registrar, to Mr Wensley
details his neglect to present the
I C U constitution to Imperial
College's Governing Body. Dated,
22nd November, the letter fuels
allegations of deceit by the I C U
President.
Sources close to M r Wensley
are concerned that he did not see fit
to discuss the letter with anyone.
Furthermore, he neglected to
inform students that the consti-
tution would not be going before
the Governing Body. (It is a
requirement that changes to the
constitution are approved by
Governing Body before it is put
into operaition.) When quizzed by
Felix on his motives, Mr Wensley
excused himself, saying: "I want to
be aware of the implications to
myself first, so that I can inform all
student members of the impli-
cations".
After the Union General
Meeting ( U G M ) in October,
Andrew Wensley presented the
U G M ratified constitution to Peter
Mee. M r Wensley expected the
constitution to be approved at the
next Governing Body meeting on
12th November. From the agenda it
would have been apparent from a
week before the meeting that this
was not to be the case.
Interviewed by Felix, Peter Mee
expressed regret at the way in
which the I C U constitution has
been handled. M r Mee showed
some surprise that Mr Wensley had
claimed, in early December, that
the constitution had gone to the
Governing Body. He made it clear
that M r Wensley would have
known this was not true. After two
months of silence, Mr Wensley
presented these problems to the
Executive Committee for the first
time in a meeting held yesterday
evening.
Mr Mee went on to announce
that he had spoken to the Chairman
of the Governing Body. As a result,
the Governing Body would accept
the constitution as a 'working
document'. While nobody dis-
agreed with the aims of the
constitution, he said that it could
not be considered complete.
Peter Mee also suggested that
staff advice might have been wise.
The College is currently setting up
a committee to formulate a final
constituion in the light of the
current dilemma and the new
Government legislation regarding
student unions. The committee will
consist of the I C U President, the
four Constituent College Union
Presidents and several staff
members, including Mr Mee.
Discussing the changes and
people's reactions within the
College M r Mee regretfully said:
"One has to know from past
experience that of our 7,000
students there's not more than a
handful [who are concerned] about
the operation of [their] union."
Union Minibus in Hit and Run
Some of the Union's fleet of minibuses earlier this week
BY MICHAEL INGRAM
Investigations are being made into
the possibility of a Union minibus
being involved in a 'hit and run'
incident over the Christmas
holiday.
The incident, which took place
in the early hours of New Year's
Day, resulted in one person being
seriously injured.
Police in Kent who were called
to the scene found a vehicle
bearing the number plates of a
minibus registered as belonging to
Imperial College Union.
The vehicle registration number
corresponds with that of a minibus
involved in an accident over the
summer holiday {Felix 974) in
which the only part of the minibus
left undamaged was apparently the
footplate at the back.
Union Officials said it was
'unlikely' that the minibus was
repairable and classed it as a write-
off.
Although the minibus was still
registered to ICU, Dave Goddard,
Deputy President (Finance and
Services) said that there was no
risk of liability to the Union
regarding the accident.
The minibus has since been
found abandoned and burnt out and
it is unclear at present if the vehicle
was in fact the minibus or whether
the number plates had been used on
a different vehicle. Police are
conducting a detailed examination
to determine if the vehicle is the
Union's minibus. The engine and
chassis serial numbers have been
supplied for this purpose.
