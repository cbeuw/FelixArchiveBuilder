Unfortunately, Sheriff E d Earl played by big
butch Burt Reynolds, who wants to protect the
Chicken Ranch so he can be sure of his weekly
handful of Miss M o n a , is unused to handling
the media, and attempts to remove Melvin the
way he might remove a stubborn mule, with
predictable results: he hits the headlines.
Certainly a film which has its moments, but
somehow falls between several stools. It never
'gets its pants down' and becomes a fully
fledged sexual romp, never beomces farce,
never becomes really a musical (there are only
nine numbers in a two hour film). There are
s o m e g o o d o n e - l i n e r s a n d s o m e c l e v e r
Dolly Parton showing off her assets
caricatures of the state politicians, including an
appearnce by Robert Mandan (Mr Tate of
Soap tame) who claims he must have been
drugged by commies when he is fouind 'red
handed' in the brothel. However, Ed Earl and
Miss M o n a don't provide much of a central
focus for the film. The only two talents Dolly
Parton displayed were the ones you were
aware of as soon as she walks on, ana which
the wardrobe department (and the plastic
surgeons?) do nothing to conceal.
So if y o u like some good clean rib-tickling
fun then purdner, you'd better mosey on down
to the old Plaza in Leicester Square anytime
yer hear?

Hamlet by Shakespeare, directed by
Jonathan Miller at the Piccadilly Theatre.
After a successful season at the Donmar
W a r e h o u s e i n A u g u s t , J o n a t h a n M i l l e r ' s
Hamlet is n o w at the Piccadilly T h e a t r e .
Another production of his, Verdi's Rigoletto, is
currently being given to packed houses at the
London Coliseum. Renaissance man Miller is
as busy as ever, and despite various rumours,
he is not about to leave the stage for good.
P r e m i e r i n g i n J a n u a r y 1983 will b e h i s
production of Mozart's The Magic Flute tor
Scottish Opera, and the following summer he
will be directing another Mozart opera at the
Opera Theater at S t Louis in the U S .
Hamlet c e n t r e s a r o u n d t h e p o p u l a r
Elizabethan theme of revenge. T h e talented
Anton Lesser plays Hamlet and witnesses the
ghost of his father. The apparition informs him
that the man who married his mother so soon
after the funeral did in fact murder his father.
Shakespeare's great tragedy unfurls from here
and exposes numerous issues in its stride.
Because of the play's richness in its language
and ideas, these issues are open to a number
of different interpretations, but one can be
fairly sure that S h a k e s p e a r e intended to
explore several points: the psychological
e x p l o r a t i o n of H a m l e t ' s relationships, t h e
physical and philosophical agony of the hero
unable to bring himself to carry out his task of
revenge, the tenuous dividing line between
sanity and madness, and the influence of the
supernatural in man's dealings.

been i n the U n i o n long enough
to be listed as one of its fixed
assets. T h e title U n i o n A d m i n -
istrator covers an astonishing
variety of jobs, all of which Jen
can be found doing (at the same
time) w i t h h e r o w n f o r c e f u l
efficiency and good humour. But
just occasionally the forcefulness
takes over with results which
might have been avoided with a
bit more c o m m o n sense, as is
illustrated by the following:
One o f the U n i o n A d m i n -

" S t e p h e n h i m s e l f must have

with the brusque cheerfulness he
