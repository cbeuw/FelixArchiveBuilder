OPINION
Continuing FELIX'S tradition of providing a
'soapbox' platform for anyone to express their
opinion, Michael Newman, Life Sci 1, gives his
thoughts on human violence.
A Misused
Filing Cabinet
On a Panorama programme some months ago several IRA terrorists
were interviewed. One had murdered a policeman. When asked why, he
replied that he had not seen a man but a uniform. He had destroyed an
enemy, a blue uniform, a label. He had reduced human beings to
simplistic labels, this rejection of their humanity enabling him to justify
his act of cold-blooded murder. O n October 26 1982 it was reported
that two Catholics and a Protestant had been killed; did their murderers
see them as human beings or labels?
Homo sapiens are thinking
animals, we are investigators,
seekers o f k n o w l e d g e a n d
understanding, classifiers. We
classify everything. As scientists
most of us should realise that
classification is a useful and
necessary tool, that it involves
exact a n d strict rules a n d
definitions. It is used to simplify,
order, show relationships and as
a result to explain and under-
stand. We all use the technique
of labelling, we use the scientific
system but most importantly we
use labels to classify ourselves.
We classify ourselves accord-
ing to the colour of our skins,
where we were born, our ages,
our p o l i t i c a l a n d r e l i g i o u s
beliefs, the months in which we
were born, our sex. We might be
divided from people we might
otherwise have befriended. We
might hate people we might
otherwise have liked. We might
ignore people that we might
otherwise have listened to. We
might threaten people with a
terrifying destruction to whom
we might otherwise have offered
kindness and love. We might kill
those who we might otherwise
have saved.
When we use labels on human
groups we tend to forget that we
are using a scientific tool, a
s i m p l i f i c a t i o n . We actually
conceive and talk of the label as
if it exists in itself. In our
description of world affairs we
talk of Russia, America and
C h i n a . We give these terms,
characters. We create out of
millions of people an entity. The
dehumanising label, the mental
conversion of many individual
h u m a n beings into a single
entity, an entity with its own
behaviour patterns and charac-

teristics. A thing that can easily
be attributed with any evil
intention or act. A thing that is
not d i s c r i m i n a t i n g between
innocent and guilty, between
helpless and strong, between
civilian and military, between
individuals. We fantasise about
Bears, Bulldogs, Dragons, Reds
We psychoanalyse these crea-
tures, we speak of them and their
possible behaviour.
Using 'vandalistic' classifica-
tion we reject the individuality of
the members of the groups we
label; we only see the label itself,
the tag is not a mere simplifica-
tion but a 'reality'. We do not
see or speak of human beings,
we ignore their humanity. It is so
much easier on the conscience to
speak of destroying mere labels.
Indeed w i t h o u t this d r e a m
of the filing cabinet our so-called
justification for murder, indis-
criminate killing, nuclear war
would be seen to be what they
really are: empty, dangerous and
unethical.
It has been said that nuclear
weapons are immoral, it has
been said that our nature is one
of violence, and therefore we are
not responsible for the present
appalling situation. Our nature
is not one of violence but one
of thought; how else could we
have the ingenuity and yet the
stupidity to build these weapons?
Everyone seems to condemn
nuclear weapons; I do not. N o
object can be i m m o r a l , we
cannot shift the responsiblity
onto the bombs themselves.
They are not evil or dangerous,
it is the attitude that results in
people building them, planning
their use, paying for them,
i n t e n d i n g to use them a n d
justifying their use. It is us and
the arguments we advocate.
Some people propose that it is
impossible to disinvent nuclear
weapons, so what? Ignorance is
not the solution to the problem,
knowledge has no dangers. It is
its application that we must be
wary of. The danger lies in what
we use the knowledge for, not
the knowledge itself.
There are many people in this
world who believe the indis-
crimate slaughter of millions of
human beings is justifiable,
they, metaphorically, each hold a
pistol to the head of a young,
defenceless, innocent child. This
child could be yours, it would
not matter to the person whose
finger is on the trigger. I ask you
is the gun the problem? If we
were to disarm the person surely
s/he could use another gun or
w e a p o n or even their bare
hands. The child would not be
safe. The only solution would be
to persuade the intended mur-
derer that there is no justifica-
tion to k i l l the c h i l d a n d
therefore no justification to
threaten its life. I ask you to
renounce your justification and
to persuade others that there are
no reasons to kill the innocent.
YOUR F1N&ER ON THE
TRIG-G-ER.
We threaten the indiscriminate
mass murder of a whole nation,
of the people of a continent. We
use the same dehumanisation
that Hitler used in his slaughter
of the Jewish people. We dwell
in a horrifying dream world. In
our nightmares we turn "nations
into regiments of ghosts" (J
Bronowski). Will we ever wake
up? Will you ever understand?
