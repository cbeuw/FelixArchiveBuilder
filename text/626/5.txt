Bar Accounts
F o r many years n o w M r R o y
F r a n c i s , a l e c t u r e r i n t h e
department o f computing, has
been p r e s s i n g f o r ' o p e n b a r
accounts'. This controversy has
been reopened recently after M r
Francis's removal from the bar
committee a n d C o l i n C o o p e r
has proposed a motion o n this
issue which will be discussed at
T u e s d a y ' s U G M . B u t b e f o r e
o p i n i o n s are p u t f o r w a r d , i t
might be as well to clear up some
of the misconceptions about the
b a r s a n d t h e i r a c c o u n t i n g
procedure.
The bars i n I C are all run by
College. Non e o f them has any
concern with the U n i o n ' s money
except in so far as students drink
there. P o l i c y f o r the bars is
d e t e r m i n e d b y t h e R e f e c t o r y
Committee, a College committee
chaired by D r B o b Schroter and
EDITORIAL
including a m o n g its members
three s t u d e n t r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s .
But the Refectory Committee
takes recommendations o n bar
policy from the B a r S u b c o m -
mittee which, although it is a
s u b c o m m i t t e e o f a C o l l e g e
c o m m i t t e e , i s t r a d i t i o n a l l y
c h a i r e d b y a U n i o n O f f i c e r ,
currently Stephen G o u l d e r , I C U
President.
T h e b a r s u b c o m m i t t e e , i n
c o m m o n with many organisa-
tions, produces both financial
and management accounts, a n d
there is a n important distinction
to be drawn between the t w o .
F i n a n c i a l a c c o u n t s a r e t h e
statements which a n organisa-
t i o n m a k e s t o t h e p u b l i c t o
inform them o f its monetary
dealings throughout the year: its
profit or loss, its ownership o f
assets, its liabilities a n d so o n
and so forth. I C is required by
l a w a n n u a l l y p r o d u c e a set
of financial accounts, to have
them audited and to make them
public, and these are the accounts
which give the figures quoted i n
t h e f i r s t p a r a g r a p h o f J o n
Stanley's letter.
The management accounts are
a m u c h more detailed act o f
accounts whose purpose is not to
inform the public, but to enable
the management (the Refectory
Committee i n this case) to best
d e c i d e o n p o l i c y . I C b a r s '
management accounts are made
a v a i l a b l e t o t h e R e f e c t o r y
Committee a n d to most members
of the bar subcommittee, i n c l u d -
ing Stephen G o u l d e r , but not
R o y Francis.
So i f the financial accounts
make it clear that there is n o
question o f anything illicit going
on, a n d management accounts
are not intended to be public
anyway, w h y a l l the fuss?
T h e a n s w e r is t h a t t h e r e
doesn't seem to be a n y reason
for not disclosing them. M a n a g e -
m e n t a c c o u n t s are n o r m a l l y
kept secret to avoid disclosing
information to competitors, but
this is irrelevant i n o u r case. M r
G o u l d e r says t h a t d e t a i l s o f
i n d u s t r i a l s t a f f w a g e s a n d
bonuses must be kept discreet,
and of course this is true; but it
wouldn't take m u c h to a d d the
f i g u r e s t o g e t h e r u n d e r t h e

heading 'salaries'. J o h n Stanley
asserts that it w o u l d be i n c o n -
venient to compile the i n f o r m a -
tion; not so, since it is already
c o m p i l e d f o r t h e R e f e c t o r y
C o m m i t t e e . A n d t h e o t h e r
excuses offered are so astonish-
i n g l y w o o l l y t h a t t h e y r e a l l y
make y o u wonder what's being
hidden: " T h e accounts w o u l d be
o p e n t o m i s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n b y
people w h o w o u l d not under-
stand t h e m , " a n d " T h e r e is n o
need to disclose the accounts
because N i c k M o r t o n has assured
us that everything is o k a y . "
The financial accounts make it
clear there are inefficiencies i n
the way the bars are r u n , a n d
because o f stonewalling f r o m
College over the management
accounts one cannot say just
where they lie, a n d so cannot
suggest improvements.
But i n his election manifesto
Stephen G o u l d e r promised to
bring the U n i o n Refectory under
s t u d e n t c o n t r o l . T h e U n i o n
R e f e c t o r y i s n o m o r e , b u t
c o u l d n ' t S t e p h e n a d a p t h i s
policy to bring one o r more o f
the bars under student control?
Fire Doors
Last week's Below the Belt made
an o b s c u r e reference t o fire
doors i n the H u x l e y B u i l d i n g
b e i n g l o c k e d a f t e r 7 : 0 0 p m .
U n k n o w n to F E L I X staff, the
Safety Officer in the Department
of C o m p u t i n g , Iain Stinson, was
discussing this very point with
Geoffrey Reeves, head o f security
(see the news s t o r y o n p a g e
three) a n d happily n o w a l l has
been sorted out i n the H u x l e y
Building.
So I turned m y attention to
Southside, where there are two
fire doors o n every landing, each
with a notice: ' F i r e D o o r , d o not
w e d g e o p e n ' . D e s p i t e t h i s
warning and the inherent danger,
I checked twenty-four doors a n d
found nineteen o f them wedged
back. D o n ' t y o u have any regard
for your o w n safety?
