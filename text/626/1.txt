'WE'VE BEEN
RIPPED OFF!'
The Biochemistry department has been abusing Royal College of
Science Union funds, according to an article in last week's R C S U
Broadsheet.
For the last two years, lectures arranged by the Biochemistry
Society with funds from R C S U have been used as part of
postgraduates' examinable course. The Society receives its grant
from the R C S U to provide informal lectures (not just to members of
the department but to all members of the Union) on subjects ranging
from aspects of biochemistry to the virtues of real ale. R C S U officials
have complained that recent lectures have not been of general
interest, citing as examples lectures such as 'The U N C Operon and
synthesis of A T P in E coli nitrodiondria and diloraplasts'.
The department's defence is
'Blind and
B ackward-Looking'

Enoch Powell in a speech to IC
Conservative Society claimed
that Britain is slowly bleeding to
death by exporting its capital.
M r Powell also stated that he
that in accordance with a ruling
by the University of London two
years ago, it must provide
postgraduates with material
outside their own specialised
subject, and it was therefore
logical to examine them on the
society's lectures. At present,
postgraduates can officially be
examined on any six of the
society's lectures, although there
is no written paper on them.
As a compromise, the depart-
ment has offered to match the
R C S U grant with an equal
amount of their own money, and,
to use the combined funds to
provide more lectures of a high
s t a n d a r d . In a n t i c i p a t i o n ,
lectures have been arranged for
next term f r o m two N o b e l
prizeweinners: Aaron Klug of
Cambridge and Professor Porter,
the head of Biochemistry at
O x f o r d . It is t h o u g h t that
without this combined funding,
the society will have overrun the
budget before Christmas.
This offer will be considered
by the next R C S General Com-
mittee meeting next Monday.
