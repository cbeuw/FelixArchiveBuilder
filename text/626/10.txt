at the Hayward Gallery
Getting There "
The Hayward Gallery is part of the South Bank
complex, which also includes the Royal Festival
Hall (concerts), the National Theatre (plays)
and the National Film Theatre (favourable rates
for student members). The closest tube station
is Waterloo. Going from College, the trip in-
volves changing from the District or Circle line
to the Northern or Bakerloo, to get from
Embankment to Waterloo. If it's a nice day, I
The South Bank complex is built of mud-
coloured concrete. F r o m outside it looks a
cross between an architecturally significant
blockhouse and an overgrown rabbit-warren.
It works far better inside: the bare concrete is
an equally appropriate setting for the plush
seating and carpets fo the auditoria and the
pale, polished floors of the Hayward Gallery.
Arte Italiana 1960-82
The exhibition of contemporary Italian art at
the Hayward is the largest ever staged outside
Italy. About eighty artists are represented. The
exhibiton has been organised by the City of
Milan and the works on view were selected by a
panel of five Italian critics: their combined
viewpoint has, no doubt, biased the selection,
though to what extent I'm not really qualified
to judge.
A small pamphlet listing the artists' names
and giving a plan of the exhibition will be
h a n d e d to you with your ticket. F u r t h e r
b a c k g r o u n d m a y be g l e a n e d f r o m the
catalogue. But the exhibition is an immediately
enjoyable one, even without delving into the
whys and wherefores of each of the works on
show.
Sort of chronological order:
The show begins in a small darkened room
with a set of U V lamps. P i n k and green
component! viriabili -and it moves!
The section of Italian pop art also has great
style and appeal. 'Curves at man's level' is a
5m-long crucifix (?), laid flat on the floor—but
He's assembled out of vertical-sided plants,
like a low-resolution contour map. 'L'atelier
recommend you save the hassle of changing
lines for one stop and get out at Embankment
(as shown in sketch map). Hungerford Bridge
is a railway bridge with a pedestrian footpath;
from it there's a good view of the South Bank,
of Cleopatra's Needle (on Victoria Embank-
m e n t , just i n f r o n t of the E m b a n k m e n t
Gardens) and, looking downstream, of the
dome of St Paul's Cathedral.
fluorescent dots make lines which appear to
recede far beyond the corners of the room.
Emerging, back into 'gallery light', a series of
Achrome works by Piero Manzoni delight in
the tactile appeal of polystyrene pellets, glass
wool and suchlike unexpected materials.
Arte cinetica is kinetic art. Press the button
and watch it dazzle/pulsate/twitch/flutter...
sylish coffee-table art!
Rouge' is a vast jigsaw, a brightly coloured
homage to Matisse containing references to
his portraits, nudes and decoupages.
In 'New- and Lyrical-Abstraction' traditional
p a i n t i n g m a t e r i a l s are u s e d . T r a d i t i o n a l
pictures invite the eye to penetrate their
interiors and to explore from the surface to the
illusory depths. These pictures either deny the
i l l u s i o n of s p a t i a l r e c e s s i o n e n t i r e l y o r ,
a c k n o w l e d g i n g that a b s o l u t e flatness in
p a i n t i n g is i m p o s s i b l e to a c h i e v e , they
experiment with exclusively visual sensations
of depth. Carlo Battaglia's 'Ultramarine 3' uses
purple, gold and pink to produce an illusion of
depth; his waves are definitely not solid and yet
seem to shrink into the distance. Another
e n o r m o u s l y powerful effect is created by
Claudio Olivieri. His pictures are very dark,
a n d the v a r i a t i o n s of c o l o u r a n d tone
extremely subtle. Given time for the eye to
adjust, the deep burgundy and blue-green
become 'live' and the canvas quivers and
begins to undulate.
Perhaps the most exciting section is that of
' N u o v e T e n d e n z e ' . Italian art is stylish,
e x u b e r a n t a n d b u r s t i n g w i t h talent a n d
experiment. I particularly liked Aldo Spoldi's
'Adventures of G o r d o n P y m ' n , which are
delightful, easy to appreciate and eminently
covetable!
