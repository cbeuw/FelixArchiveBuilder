Hot o n the heels of Deathtrap,
another West End money-spinner
hits the big screen. I must admit I
didn't see The Best Little Whore-
house in Texas w h i l e it w a s
playing in Shaftesbury Avenue, so
I'm in n o position to say h o w
faithful the adaptation is.
with the title song 'Nothing Dirty
Going O n ' . Right, you guessed it,
it's a m u s i c a l . T h e tunes are
bouncy inoffensive little numbers,

local house of ill repute is known,
has we are told, been in existence
for years. Illegal, but enshrined in
folklore and accepted by all, until
that is, a crusading T V consumer
advocate Melvin P Thorpe decides
it is a suitable target for a fearless
expose of filth and corruption to
enhance his glory, and his ratings.
Melvin, manically played by the
evergreen D o m D e Luise is a sort
of cross between Esther Rancid
and Billy G r a h a m and is hence
totally aware of his own impor-
