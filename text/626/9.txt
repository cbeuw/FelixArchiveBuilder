T h e r e is s o m e excellent acting in this
p r o d u c t i o n . J o h n G r i l l o p l a y s a r o u n d -
spectacled, academic looking Horatio, Philip
Locke portrays the ghost and the 'Player
K i n g ' , and K e n Stott plays R o s e n c r a n t z
(looking like a cross between David Bellamy
and James Galway). However, the choicest
Covent Garden
Tragedy
Y o u are either guests or girls of Mother
P u n c h b o w l , t h e a u d i e n c e t o l d b e f o r e
Artsox (a group of actors with varying degrees
of allegiance to College) begin their production
of The Covent Garden Tragedy. Written by
Henry Fielding in the early eighteenth century,
this short play explores the morality of the
time, the discussion and arguments taking
p l a c e i n the b a c k p a r l o u r of M o t h e r
Punchbowl's brothel.
Since the play is written in a burlesque style
some of the points are lost on the audience but
the cast performed well, particularly Chris
Pickup as Lovegirls and Nikki Triscott as
Mother Punchbowl.
alas poor - er,
acting comes from Anton Lesser as Hamlet
and Kathryn Pogson as Ophelia, his betrothed.
O p h e l i a ' s nervous m a n n e r i s m s and hand
movements, developed after hearing the death
of her father (accidentally, at the hands of
Hamlet) are subconsciously mimicked by her
brother Laertes (Iain Mitchell) on hearing of
her subsequent death. Such intriguing details
obviously derive from Miller's background in
medical psychiatry! A very good production
indeed.

the declared aims of promoting
the acceptance of the natural
superiority of men over women
and to make women completely

to the will of men. F u l l details of
this ludicrous display of chavin-
