IC vs Ashford 2-2
Despite having lost three players
from last week's team I C should
still have won this game, es-
p e c i a l l y i f we h a d b o t h e r e d
taking part in the first half. The
inspiration/perspiration gained
from the unwashed first team
shirts probably accounted for
our first half lethargy and also
the sight of the fifty year old, six
foot, ogre in the A s h f o r d goal
would have been enough to keep
any side pushed back in their
own half.
Ashford went two goals up in
the first twenty minutes through
one well-taken goal and some
interesting rugby tactics. F o l l o w -
ing this I C dared to make their
first attack on the A s h f o r d goal
a n d t h i s e n d e d w i t h H o p e
confidently beating the keeper.
In the second half I C played
much better, dealing adequately
with most A s h f o r d attacks and
o c c a s i o n a l l y s h o w i n g s o m e
attacking ability. Five minutes
from the end Purdy stormed in
from the left wing to deflect a
s t o r m e r o f a g o a l i n t o the
Ashford net. This he promptly
followed by trying to out-stare
the aforementnioned ogre from
a distance of about six inches.
U n f o r t u n a t e l y battle d i d not
commence and Purdy lives to
fight another day.
Once again Jones sparkled in
goal—he was light years away—
managing to miss, sit on or catch
the ball every time it was hit at
him. Jones' ulterior plan to give
away as many penalty strikes as
possible was foiled successfully
by some distinctly incompetent
umpiring.
T e a m : Jones, Cunningham,
Wigney, Whitehead, Bailey,
Salter, Pitkethley, Farmer,
Payne, Hope, Purdy.
Umpire: Roessink.

D I , C Eldridge and D I K
Barnet gave ample support with
FELIX • H H H H H H I
comments on the ICS's inability
to assume the correct positions.
The initial shoot out produced
two enemy casualties who still
fought back well. H a v i n g forced
us to retreat D C I W a l l r e -

assault.
This bloody onslaught ensued
with Eldridge finally arresting
S O P ' s v e r s i o n of the B o s t o n
Strangler and W P C s Yates and
Storay standing firm to prevent
any fast breakaways.
The prisoners finally brought

D u m b f o u n d s k i entered a major-

IC vs Royal Holloway 54-0
The 2nd X V outing to R o y a l
H o l l o w a y , while not exactly a
severe test for the team, provided
a large b o o s t i n m o r a l e a n d
resultant beer-drinking.
The usual I C problem of "too
much beer the night before"
produced a slow start, as well as
J o h n Symes pained expression,
playing in his new psoition on
the flank. I C applied constant, if
not very enthusiastic pressure,
dominating in almost all areas of
the game, resulting in a 14-0 lead
at half-time.

I C vs Q M C 8-1
So the badminton reports are
boring are they? A t least that's
what Shirley says! So here's a
special non-boring badminton
report.
The third team crashed into
Q u e e n M a r y C o l l e g e c a u s i n g
gasps from passers-by marvelling
at the ' J o h n Scott Superheroes'.
D u r i n g the battle that followed
o u r t h i r d team r a g e d l i k e a
typhoon and crushed the opposi-
tion mercilessly. O n l y a severe
and mortal blister kept Ian and
N i c k f r o m c o m p l e t i n g t h e
whitewash. In short, we won
easily.
A n interesting thing to emerge
from the after match socialising
was that nine out of ten A C C
chairmen can't tell the difference
between pizza and beefburger!
Team: Nick, Ian, Pete, John S,
Chris, John M.

IC vs Bedford 4-5
H e r e ' s a n o t h e r n o n - b o r i n g
badminton report specially for
Shirley.
The full might of the B a d m i n -
ton C l u b was thrown behind the
mixed third team on Saturday—
the latest invention from I C . The
star attractions Ian and M i r a n d a
lost two games but were other-
wise unbeaten!
The second pair suffered from
c o n t i n u e d d i s a g r e e m e n t c u l -
minating in the deliberate trip by
Helen leaving Pete writhing.
Perhaps the tensest games were
played by the third pair where
tempers frayed as the last Jaffa
cake was eaten.
The score suggests a massacre
but really the teams were quite
close (but not intimate).
