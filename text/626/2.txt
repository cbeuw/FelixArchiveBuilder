Disgusting!
That's the official RCS opinion of a Mooney
Freshers' Dinner, as Stephen Goulder
complains of 'Gristle in Dubious Sauce'.
The Royal College of Science
Union may refuse to pay the full
amount for the physics freshers'
dinner, after complaints of
disgusting food and poor service.
TC Union President Stephen
Goulder, who was a guest at the
dinner, referred to the main
course (described on the menu as
'veal fricassee') as 'gristle in
dubious sauce'. There was also a
shortage of waiters, the food was
served cold and diners were
rationed to one glass of wine
each. M r Goulder later criticised
the Union for selecting a meal
that "Mooney can't cook".
Chas Fuller, the R C S U Hon-
orary Secretary, told F E L I X
that he had written to Refectory
Manager V i c t o r M o o n e y in July
making arrangements for all the
dinners, a n d that M r M o o n e y
had promised to write back with
comments a n d suggestions for
menus. H e has not heard from
the Refectories since, and he has
still not even received official
c o n f i r m a t i o n o f t h e p r i c e s ,
although the bills for the other
freshers' dinners have already
arrived.
R C S U officials are awaiting
reaction from the 120 people
who paid £6.50 for the physics
dinner, before reaching a decision
on whether or not to pay next
week.
...and a good
job too!
Industrial Society's Careers Fair
on Wednesday turned out to be
the big success it promised to be,
with the JCR full of companies
and students.
The standard of the displays
varied widely from full blown
a u d i o - v i s u a l a n d c o m p u t e r
demonstrations from the larger
companies to hand written signs
and xeroxed handouts from the
smaller fry. A l l the students
talked to considered it useful to
be able to chat with representa-
tives of the companies, including
recent graduates working for
that company on some stalls.
Many left the J C R loaded down
with information and promising
to return for another bout in the
afternoon.
John Barrett, vice chairman of
Industrial Society said that all
bad gone well and that all the
companies billed in F E L I X had
turned up together with a few
extras. M r Barrett thanked
F E L I X for printing the extra
copies of last week's guide to the
fair. Unfortunately some be-
mused recipients of the guide
were confused by the Mata Hari
review which was on the same
page, and were obviously dis-
appointed that Lena L o v i c h
wasn't one of the attractions.

Fire in Selkirk

Drinking and

T h r e e m e m b e r s o f C i t y a n d
' G u i l d s M o t o r C l u b are looking
for sponsorship to take part i n
the Beaujolais Rally later this
month. They have already been
loaned a car by British Leyland.

£500 for the Bromley Mentally

m o n e y t o c o v e r t h e i r c o s t s ,
which include a £160 entry fee.
They are therefore approaching
local wine firms to raise the rest
of the money.
T h e R a l l y is a t r a d i t i o n a l
event; 150 cars will start from a
vineyard near L y o n at midnight
on Sunday November 14 and the
a i m i s t o b r i n g a b o t t l e o f
N o u v e a u Beajolais to E n g l a n d
on the 8:00am Boulogne ferry,
covering as short a distance as
p o s s i b l e . B e c a u s e t h e t i g h t
schedule involves a n eight-hour
non-stop, high-speed journey,
they will be driving a modified
Rover 2300S loaned to them by
British L e y l a n d Promotions.
The rally is the traditional
preserve o f wealthy drivers with
a taste f o r wine. Because o f the
high cost o f participating, the
event finishes i n true style with a
champagne lunch at the Hotel
Metropolis Brighton
