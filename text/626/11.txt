STOIC
There can hardly be a single Imperial College
student who has not at some time or other
ignored S T O I C . In fact S T O I C is probably
held to be one of the foremost centres of that
great IC tradition: apathy.
Well, you're all wronq...the indifference and
lackadaisical quality of our broadcasts is the
result of hours of blood, tears and agony,
m e t i c u l o u s t e c h n i c a l c a r e a n d i n t e n s i v e
creative frenzies called 'production meetings'.
" O K , so w h a t ? " I hear y o u say, " w h y
bother?"
Well, years ago the S T O I C hierarchy would
have agreed with you, but now under the
leadership of Martin Z C o w a n , ably assisted
by the experienced Lawrence Q Windley and
the financial tinkering of Martin X Simms,
S T O I C is slowly pulling out of the doldrums of
C o l l e g e n e w s i n t o t h e r e a l m s of
entertainment!
Don't be normal, join the millions of particles
of dust in front of our screens.
R e m e m b e r : Y o u c a n w i p e a w a y o u r
audience but we've already spent the budget.
Bookshop News
Would the lecturer who is recommending
Chartwell Survey B o o k s please let me know
the reference number, so I can stock them.
There are still a few lecturers who are telling
s t u d e n t s to buy p a r t i c u l a r titles but they
haven't told me. Please I must know so I can at
least try and stock enough for everyone's
need. If you can't get to the Bookshop, you
can ring me on internal 2226.
If the young librarian who daily comes into
the B o o k s h o p and browses through / hafe Sex
by Williams & W o o d £1.95 would care to come
and see me. I can let her/him have the well
thumbed copy at a slight discount.
A c a d e m i c P r e s s L t d will be h a v i n g a n
exhibition of technical books translated from

November 9, 10 and 11. It will cover the
f o l l o w i n g s u b j e c t s : e n g i n e e r i n g , p h y s i c s ,
chemistry, maths and biology. I am assured by

Sci Fi
Creation is a cyclic process.
Life was spawned in the murky soup of the
ancient oceans and in a billion years that is
where it will all end. Should some alien race
visit this lonely star system in the far future
they will find a huge ball of salty water
c o n t a i n i n g all that we ever w e r e , as we
dissolved beneath a continuous gentle drizzle
of acid rain. A n d to add to the beauty of .this
glistening crystal sphere, it will be ringed by a
delicate ribbon of dust and r o c k — t h e relic of a
long dead moon. A n d of the nature of the life in
the massive tear
W h o cares?
T o all those who turned up last Thursday for
the S F Soc Call My Bluff, hope you will all have
recovered enough to come along to The Nude
Bomb.
