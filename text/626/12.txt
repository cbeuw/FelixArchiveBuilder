PORT
Dear Sir.
What about basketball?!
What am I going on about
y o u may well ask yourself.
Okay, fair question.
Maybe we aren't the most
successful club in the A C C , but
shouldn't we at least be men-
tioned Ian Bull (a Grand Man...
can we have some money...
grease, grease) in your I C U
Council Guide. I could offer an
alternative, maybe put us under
SCAB?!
Admittedly it did start " F E L I X
proudly presents" and we aren't
much to be proud of, but "times
they are a c h a n g i n ' " as the
immortal 'Bob' said.
My fellow team members may
not be too impressed with this
letter, well I'd like to point out
on their behalf that we have a
100% record this season, we
h a v e n ' t lost a m a t c h . . . W e
haven't actually played any yet
but at least we've got off on the
right foot (or left if you are
driving for your lay-up from the
left—note the basketball tech-
nicality!)
I hope you got the message.

Fencing
Well, we've had our first match
of the season, against Kings
College.
We were at home, and the
date was last Friday. The match
started at about 6:00pm, when
everybody was getting bored
with chatting. First came the
mens foil and ladies foil; the
ladies won with relative ease, but
the men, after a valiant struggle
were beaten.
Next came the novices foil and
the epee. We won the first, again
with relative ease, but unfor-
tunately our epeists were fencing
as though their legs had been'
tied together, and found them-
selves hammered into the ground
—losing 8-1.
The sabres came last, but not
least, as after another valiant
struggle they were just beaten, 5-
4. This last, however, took the
time up to 11:00pm. Time for a
quick pasty from the bar together
before a regretful separation,
and' a look forward to a return
match.
Cross Country
Three full IC teams turned out
for the firs London Colleges
League match at Parliament Hill
Fields on Wednesday and such
was the strength in depth of the
c l u b that we h a d t h i r t e e n
runners finishing in the top half
of a field of 170. John Frost, the
club captain, lead the team with
typical determination and gritty
finishing; gently barging a rival
off course yards from the line.
However, the outstanding run
of the day came from Hugh
Dixon, who, after a mediocre
weekend race, stayed with the
leaders throughout to finish
fourth, just ten seconds behind
the winner. Mandy Tindall had
another good race to finish third
in the ladies event.
Frisbee
U l t i m a t e F r i s b e e ! ! A team
frisbee game from the U S A .
Following the big success of the
W e e k s H a l l / L i n s t e a d H a l l
ultimate frisbee games, there will
be a meeting for anyone from
other Halls who would like to
play on a team, or organise new
t e a m s i n t h e i r H a l l s . T h e
location is room C2, Linstead
Hall extension, Monday Nov 8
at 7:30pm. If unable to attend,
contact Mike Davis either in
r o o m C 8 L i n s t e a d H a l l or
through Elec Eng letter-racks.
Everyone is encouraged to come
along and to play as little or as
often as they like on Sunday
afternoons in Hyde Park.
Boat
I C B C took two ladies' crews to
Henley on Sunday, for the first
ever Upper Thames Head. This
could be the start of a good
season for the Boat Club as they
brought home the pots for the
fastest women's four on the river
that day, against stiff opposition.
Crew 1: A Doyle, J Dickson, E
Blankenburgs, D Turner, D
Harrell.
Crew 2: HMeasures, B Walden,
H Bramwell, V Snewin, and
Ermintrude.
Snooker
IC s Manor Park 7-5
First victory of the season for
the A team, who are still failing
to reproduce their best form in
league matches. Andy Wright
gave the most impressive per-
formance, in his debut. Nick
Gasket was less impressive, but
still managed to win his frames
against an opponent who was
more interested in arguing with
Andy Hurford about the league
rules. C l u b president Chris
Jennings has relinquished the A
team captaincy and this honour
(?) now goes to the controversial
Irishman Sean Davis.
The B and C teams begin their
matches in the U L U League next
week and all teamsheets are on
the noticeboard. The Pot Luck
doubles tournament will be held
on Sunday November 14 and is
open to everyone to enter.
Shark
Looking for a club with a sense
of porpoise? Then maybe the
Shark C l u b is for you. New
members will be welcomed by
Wilf, the president who is our
resident hammer head shark. No
experience is required as the
society provides trained instruc-
tors available to give help and
advice. Previous seasons have
seen Wilf in the public eye—
u n d e r s t u d y i n g Jaws a n d a
cameo role in Life on Earth.
The Hammer Head Shark
Club meets in the Real Whale
Bar on Friday lunchtime, Cod
permitting, or contact Wilf via
Shark Eng 3 letter-racks.
