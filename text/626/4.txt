Bar Accounts
Dear Martin
I would like to comment on
t h e i n a c c u r a c i e s c o n t a i n e d
within your news story concern-
ing the College Bars.
The B a r Accounts are fully
audited each year, and, as U G C
a c c o u n t s , p a s s t h r o u g h t h e
Office of the A u d i t o r General.
The accounts are also presented
to G o v e r n i n g B o d y a n d t h e
Finance and Executive C o m m i t -
tee of College. T h e day-to-day
bar accounts are seen by myself
and the trends are looked at.
These are, however, management
accounts a n d deal with with the
personal performance o f mem-
b e r s o f s t a f f , t h e i r w a g e s ,
bonuses, etc, a l l o f which must
be kept discreet. I agree with
N i c k M o r t o n that as long as a
student sees these accounts we
should be satisfied.
Y o u also comment o n the B a r
Committee's terms o f reference
and membership. W e have two
student r e p r e s e n t a t i v e s ( J o h n
M c C a l l i o n a n d J o h n Passmore),
in addition I a m B a r Committee
C h a i r m a n appointed by Refec-
tory Committee C h a i r m a n ( D r
B o b Schroter). This has always
been the case. A t no stage has a
student ever had the right to be
chairman, it has always been a
convention (this was affirmed at
the last revision o f the member-
ship of Bar Committee i n 1980).
T h e c h a n g e s t o t h e e x i s t i n g
(1977) terms of reference will ir
no way effect the operation oi
Bar Committee as a policy body
advising Refectory Committee.
Yours sincerely

Dear Sir
In 1981 I C ' s bars made a profit
of £13,000 o n sales o f £271,000.
In the same period the University
of L o n d o n U n i o n ' s b a r w a s
three t i m e s m o r e p r o f i t a b l e ,
m a k i n g a profit of £18,000 o n
sales o f £122,00 a profit equal to
1 5 % o f sales c o m p a r e d w i t h
College's 5%. U L U achieved its
h i g h p r o f i t s even t h o u g h its
prices were a c t u a l l y cheaper
than those at I C .
The accounts show the major
reason for the low profitability
o f b a r s i n C o l l e g e w a s h i g h
s t a f f i n g costs; 8 0 % o f gross
profits were spent i n this way. It
also seems certain that at least
one o f the four bars r u n by
C o l l e g e w a s a c t u a l l y l o s i n g
money.
Another factor seems to be the
p r i c e p a i d f o r s t o c k s . T h e
accounts suggest that College
bars were paying more for their
stocks than U L U . U L U ' s bar,
since it is student controlled, is a
member of a national student
b u y i n g c o n s o r t i u m a n d as a
result receives an extra discount
on its purchase.
It is also questionable whether
College's policy o f funding bar
d e v e l o p m e n t , b y o b t a i n i n g
money from the breweries in
return for promises to buy their
products, is really i n the best
interests of the bars' customers.
The published bar accounts
j u s t i f y h a v i n g serious d o u b t s
about the way i n which College
manages the bars. These doubts
will only be allayed if the College
makes available far more detailed
information, particularly trading
figures for individual bars.
T h e r e a r e o n l y t w o g o o d
reasons for keeping this infor-
mation secret: the inconvenience
o f c o m p i l i n g i t a n d ( m o r e
s i g n i f i c a n t l y ) a n y i n e f f i c i e n c y
would be obvious. It is sheer
arrogance to claim that more
d e t a i l e d a c c o u n t s " w o u l d be
o p e n t o m i s i n t e r p r e t a t i o n by
people who would not under-
s t a n d t h e m " . I f o r o n e a m
p e r f e c t l y c a p a b l e o f u n d e r -
s t a n d i n g t h e m , a n d w o u l d
w e l c o m e a n o p p o r t u n i t y t o
inspect them.
The H o l l a n d C l u b has shown
that it can r u n a bar far more
efficiently than M r M o o n e y . The
U n i o n should have as its a i m ,
securing control of at least one
bar i n Imperial, to be run for the
benefit of students. So long as
the present arrangements con-
tinue, we shall continue to have
the ridiculous situation where a
successful Ents event makes a
profit o n admission charges o f a
f e w h u n d r e d p o u n d s t o be
p l o u g h e d b a c k f o r s t u d e n t s '
b e n e f i t , w h i l e t h e C o l l e g e
controlled bar nets well over a
thousand pounds i n extra profit.

Dear Martin
I was interested to read the
letter last week c o m p l a i n i n g
a b o u t t h e use o f S o u t h s i d e
Refectory by cement covered
labourers. This problem arose in
the summer a n d despite com-
plaints by those of us working
o n S o u t h s i d e little was done
about it except to ban them from
having breakfast—due to the
fact that the income was badly
needed.
However n o w term has begun
and complaints have persisted I
am pleased to inform the three
first year chemists concerned
that M r M o o n e y and Security
have agreed to the placing of a
notice to the effect that unsuit-
a b l y dressed persons w i l l be
asked to leave.
If a n y o n e h a s c a u s e f o r
c o m p l a i n t please i n f o r m the
Southside Messenger who will
ask them to leave. If this system
fails to correct this abuse I
would like to be informed so
t h a t a t o t a l b a n o n o u t s i d e
custom can be implemented.

Dear FELIX
I was hoping one letter would
s u f f i c e b u t s i n c e N i c k P y n e
r e s o r t e d t o p e r s o n a l a b u s e
(albeit i n a jovial manner) in his
reply, I must make a number of
further comments.
N i c k has completely missed
my point, most of the material
used i n this pamphlet is true and
I have no objection to (most of)
the material itself (most o f it I
would be quite prepared to tell
my children—before people like
N i c k do it!) a n d I entirely agree
it is a major problem that sex
cannot be talked about freely i n
society. B u t , apart from two
sentences N i c k has completely
ignored the psychological aspect
of sex (indeed the books recom-
m e n d e d d i d as w e l l ) w h i c h
should be talked about but never
is. N i c k has only just touched on
the side effects problem of the
pill a n d not mentioned the V D
in the mid-seventies (and still is
as f a r as I k n o w ) r e a c h e d
e p i d e m i c p r o p o r t i o n s a n d
cannot always be cured.
Apart from the above, N i c k
Pyne has missed an extremely
important psychological point. It
is almost impossible to speak out
(partly because one is ridiculed
as I d e m o n s t r a t e d effectively
with last week's letter) especially
on sexual matters, and if it is
seen t h a t sex is u n i v e r s a l l y
accepted as an essential part o f a
student's life then there is a real
possibility that someone that
does not want to have sex may
be directly or indirectly forced
into it.
T h e i m p l i c a t i o n i n N i c k ' s
l e t t e r t h a t " w h e n t h e t i m e
comes" as Nick so quaintly puts
it, I will require to know about
contraceptives and masturba-
tion, partly correct. I will have to
know how best to avoid them.
Believe it or not, even i n these
times many couples feel they are
better off without these methods.
T h e C a t h o l i c C h u r c h d o e s
inform its youth about sex (think
where do Catholic children come
from?).
Just one last point, I a m in
fact r e a s o n a b l y s a n e , I a m
making a complaint, not leading
a crusade to convert I C !
Yours sincerely

Dear Martin
In the letters page last week
M a r k Alderton complains that
the booklet ...but were afraid to
ask d i d not give a "student's eye
view of Imperial College".
I can commend to h i m , for
t h i s p u r p o s e , t h e I C U n i o n
Alternative Prospectus, edited by
me, and available free from the
U n i o n Office.
Moreover, I would suggest
that h a d M a r k r e a d the A P
before coming to Imperial he
might have been less shocked, if
not less disgusted, at what he
found.
