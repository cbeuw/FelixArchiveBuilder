Proposed by: Colin Cooper,
SCAB Hon. Sec.
Seconded by: John Ferguson,
ICU Rag Chairperson.
ICU Notes:
1. That the Refectory and Bar Committees operate the
r e f e c t o r i e s and bars on behalf of the Refectory Club,
of which a l l s t a f f , students, and v i s i t o r s to Imperial
College are members.
2. That the terms of reference of the Refectory Committee
are "to ensure the p r o v i s i o n at economic rates of
adequate c a t e r i n g f a c i l i t i e s " .
3. That the Refectory Committee c o n s i s t s of three members
appointed, d i r e c t l y or i n d i r e c t l y , by the Governing
Body, four members employed i n College Block, and four
members representing the Refectory Club membership
(one s t a f f , one non-academic s t a f f , and two students).
There i s a l s o the Chairman of the Bar Committee that,
at present, must a l s o be a member of the Union Council.
The Chairman of the committee i s one of those appointed
by the Governing Body.
4. That the Bar Committee i s a Sub-Committee of the
Refectory Committee with almost the same representation,
the main d i f f e r e n c e being the Chairman.
That despite the fact that these committees are
responsible f o r the r e f e c t o r i e s and bars, the only
accounts they have been permitted to see are the o v e r a l l
t o t a l s and not the s p e c i f i c d e t a i l s of i n d i v i d u a l bars
or r e f e c t o r i e s .
That the Chairman of the Bar Committee (the ICU
President t h i s year) has seen these accounts, but has
been sworn to secrecy.
That the main campaigner for more open accounts, the
s t a f f representative Mr. R.A. F r a n c i s , has recently
been p r o p e l l e d from the Bar Committee.
5.
8 . That the terms of reference that have been used by the
Bar Committee are being changed, with the f o l l o w i n g
e f f e c t s : -
a) The Committee are no longer to be concerned with
the finance of the bars.
b) The Committee i s no longer responsible f o r the
running of the bars, only to advise the Refectory
Committee.
c) The Chairman need no longer be a member of Union
Council and i s to be appointed by the Refectory
Committee Chairman, and hence the Governing Body.
9. That the ICU President did not inform the Union of
these changes despite the f a c t that he knew about them.
ICU Believes:
1. That the members of the Refectory Club should be
properly represented on the Refectory and Bar Committees.
2. That these committees should be permitted to see the
accounts that i t considers i t needs in order to properly
run the r e f e c t o r i e s and bars.
3. That the recent changes to the terms of reference of the
Bar Committee proposed by the Refectory Committee are
unacceptable.
4. That the Union representatives on College Committees
should report to the Union any proposed changes that
e f f e c t the Union and i t s members.
ICU I n s t r u c t s :
1. The Union Executive to a c t i v e l y campaign for the above
b e l i e f s one to three i n c l u s i v e .
2. The Union Council to ensure that i t s nominees to College
Committees w i l l represent the Unions b e l i e f s , as
expressed above, to those Committees. Any represent-
a t i v e s that w i l l not must be asked to stand down.
3. That the Refectory Committee, the Rector, and the
Governing Body are to be informed that the changes made
by the Refectory Committee to the terras of reference
proposed by the Bar Committee f o r i t s e l f are unacceptable
to the Union.
4. That the next Governing Body Meeting be asked to r e j e c t
the new terms of reference f o r the Bar Committee.
