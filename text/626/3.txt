V i v a c i o u s M i r a n d a B e l l -
chambers, who has for weeks
been wowing the lads of Mech-
anical Engineering and c o l -
lected admirers from many other
disciplines was last week elected
Bo Belle 1982-3.
Raven haired stunner Miranda
gained the position as Bo's
companion by winning a Bo
awareness quiz and showing
suitable wit and intelligence for
the job.
And we at F E L I X can all see
what you mean C & G !
Miranda hopes to raise interest
in City and Guilds College apart
from carrying out her motor
club duties, especially in Bo's
eightieth birthday year.
Philip Nathan was unavailable
for comment as was Bobby Joe
S t e i n , male winner of the
horrendously sexist RCS Queen
of Jez competition.
Unfortunately M i r a n d a is
unable to carry out her first job,
riding to Brighton on Bo, as the
four seater is full of Guilds
hacks, but we hope to be seeing
much more of this Engineer's
Dream in the near future.

Labour and
Work
Mr Stanley Orme M P , Shadow
Spokesman on Industry, yester-
day told the Industrial Society
that a framework for industrial
democracy could not be imposed
on the nations businesses. The
aim of the Labour Party, said
M r Orme, was to legislate in
such a way as to allow for the
disclosure of detailed financial
information so that workers
c o u l d start the process of
concilliation on the shop floor.
There would then be a trigger
mechanism which would allow
either management or workers
to take these decision-making
processes further, even to the
main b o a r d . M r Orme was
critical of unions which refused
to take part in these processes.
In his view some unions were
afraid to make decisions that
effected the lives of their
members. Despite this M r Orme
feels that the only channel for
the expression of workers views
should be through the trades
union movement.
Profit sharing, said M r Orme,
was not reasonable incentive for
workers to take part in the
Miranda Bellchambers-an expert on Bo Photo by Katharine Alexander
decision making process, as
many parts of British industry,
such as British Leyland, will
struggle to make a profit in a
period of economic growth. The
incentive should be the chance to
decide about their job, their
wages, etc. Workers, he said
"want a good job, decent wages
and to produce things that
people will want to buy."
Consultation is, in M r Orme's
view, important as it allows for
Stanley Orme
the spreading of power from the
few hands in which it is concen-
trated. The top forty private
firms produce goods that make
up thirty percent of the sales on
the British market. Some firms
already have the will to let'
workers make decisions but the
labour party, said Mr Orme,
would give all workers the
ability to start this process. How
far they take it is up to them.
Locked In!
Students and computer operators in the Department of Computing
were asked to leave the Huxley Building last Wednesday by
Departmental Safety Officer Iain Stinson because many of the fire-
exits-were chained up.
The recent problems began
when College installed special
electric bolts to certain doors in
the Huxley Building. These bolts
hold the doors locked, but are
wired into the fire alarm circuitry
and will be released if the alarm
is triggered. However, because
of initial installation problems
the bolts did not hold the doors
shut properly, and so College
Security officials were ordered to
lock them at 7:00pm with chain
and padlocks.
This caused an obvious fire
hazard, and Mr Stinson regularly
reported the matter to Bob
Foggon, College Fire Officer,
and Security agreed to leave the
doors unchained. Last Wednes-
day the doors were padlocked
once again and after fruitlessly
asking the security guards to
.unlock them, Mr Stinson asked
the computer operators to clear
the building.
The following morning Mr
Stinson resigned his position as
Safety Officer until the matter
Iain Stinson
was cleared up. Manny Lehman,
the head of department, then
initiated a long discussion with
M r Reeves and John Smith,
College Secretary, as a result of
which the new bolts have been
p r o p e r l y i n s t a l l e d a n d M r
Stinson reinstated as Safety
Officer.
Security are still padlocking
the door connecting the Huxley
Building to the walkway, but as
this is not a F i r e E x i t no
regulations are being contra-
vened.
