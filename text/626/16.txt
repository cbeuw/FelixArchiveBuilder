payments and the unemployment
figures. ' T h e r e is no vested
interest on either side in being
" g e n u i n e " a b o u t the r e a l
meaning of unemployment fig-
ures' he said.
Enoch Powell has a laissez-
faire attitude to those figures; he
claimed that his is a realistic
point of view which neither of
the established parties dares to
take. He attacked them for not
knowing how to adjust to a new
position in the world or realising
that 3.2m out of work is a
symptom of this change. 'We
politicians are blind and back-
ward looking' he said. As for the
genuine solution to unemploy-
ment, his original topic, he said
that solving is not required, for it
solves itself. There will be a shift
from manufacturing to service
industries and internal trading;
the spare human effort will be
naturally rerouted. This is why
Enoch Powell objects to political
manipulation of the economy;
fearing it will cause problems for
a future when o u r present
p r o b l e m s w i l l have solved
themselves.
Private Education:
Freedom of Choice?
A motion that private education
should be abolished, proposed
by Sir A s h l e y B r a m a l l , was
carried at the Debating Society's
meeting yesterday lunchtime.
The scheduled opposer, John
Selwyn Gummer M P was called
away on government business
and was replaced at short notice
by Professor David Raphael, a
INEWS
Professor in the Humanities
Department.
In his i n i t i a l s p e e c h , Sir
Ashley betrayed his position as
socialist chairman of the G L C in
an attack on c o n s e r v a t i v e
educational policies. His main
points were that private educa-
tion undermines equality in
society, damages i n d u s t r i a l
relations and is detrimental to
standards in public education.
He compared the much-vaunted
point of freedom of choice with
the freedom of choice in the
United States to carry a gun.
Professor Raphael claims that
society must weigh freedom
against equality, and that a case
had only been made for im-
p r o v e m e n t s to the existing
system, not for abolishing one
aspect of it. Questions from the
floor followed, and the motion
was carried by twelve votes from
a floor of ninety.
'£25 Minimum Grant'
NUS President Neil Stewart
Dr Bruton to Leave
Dr Chris Bruton, the Honorary
Senior Treasurer of the Royal
College of Science Union, has
announced that he is to leave
Imperial at Christmas to take up
a post as Head of Administration
at the Parke-Davis Research
Unit in Cambridge. He has been
H J T since July of last year, and
now sees his career as lying
towards administration rather
than science. Dr Bruton is at
present Assistant Director of
Finance in the biochemistry
department.
Arguments for and against
affiliation to the N U S dominated
an eloquent speech delivered by
N U S President Neil Stewart
yesterday.
The 'IC Left Alliance' had
invited M r Stewart to speak on
the subject of why IC should re-
affiliate to the N U S , but with a
spirit of practicality that domin-
ated his speech (and hopefully
the N U S this year) he concen-
trated on the principal area of
NUS action: the Grants Cam-
paign.
He stressed the aim of a £25
minimum wage for students,
pointing out that many thou-
sands of students receive no
grant at all. He also stated the
aim of making students indepen-
dent of their parents by abolish-
ing the parental contribution,
and the aim of an increase of £5
a week (amounting to about
14%) on a student grant.
Affiliation
On the subject of affiliation to
the N U S , M r Stewart slammed
I C U for riding on the back of
other student unions and em-
phasised the importance of good
national representation.

PINCCCMIC
The W i n d Band are holding a free open-air
concert this Tuesday at 1:00pm on the Queens
Lawn, and the logistics of this have so far been
all too much for their committee (conductor
M i k e R a p h o n e , publicity officer D u n c a n
B i s c u i t ( D i n k y D u n k y to his friends) a n d
secretary Chris Packet) who have been trying
to count up the number of pieces of music they
need. Unfortunately, none of them can count
above 50, and so they have to use abaci.
Equally unfortunately, they only have two
abaci, both of which are broken, so that there
are no longer 9 balls on all of the rungs.
Having counted up on these, they came to
the numbers 364 and 561. So how many pieces
of music are there?
A s a hint, the number depicted on the
abacus shown, which shows 243, is actually 93
(the fact that there are 4 balls on the bottom
rung makes each ball on the next rung worth
5; 6 balls on the second rung makes each ball
on the top rung worth 7 x 5 = 35, so 243 on this
abacus is equal to (2 x 35) + (4 x 5) + 3 = 93.
G o o d luck, everyone!

Last week's solution
Here for those of you who like that sort of
thing, is the analytical solution to the last
puzzle. For those of you who don't, the answer
is that Paddy would have kept his job for a
further twenty-seven months.
Let N(y) be the number of cars in stock y
months hence.
Paddy is sacked when N(y) = y + 13, since
this is the length of time that the cars have
been in stock.
Now the number of cars in stock is equal to
the original stock, minus the number of cars
that have decayed plus the number of cars
made by Paddy's friends.
Hence N(y) = 6916 — £ k2
+ 2y
6916 — £ k 2
+ 2y = y + 13
N o w £ k ' 2
= V«y(y+i)(2y+i)
So 6916 — V6 y(y + l)(2y + 1) + 2y = y + 13
6903 = Vsyfy + l)(2y + 1) - y
(6903 x 6) = 2y3
+ 3y2
— 5y
So we must factorise the polynomial
2Y 3 + 3Y 2 _ 5 y _ 41418 to find its roots.
From inspection (!) this has a root y = 27 (or
from the Remainder Therorem, if'that's what
you called it), and with this information it is easy
to show that the other two roots are complex.
Hence the result.
Of the 24 entries, the winner chosen at ran-
dom was P G Wickramaratne who can collect
his prize from the F E L I X Office after 1:30pm
on Monday. This is one puzzle that I didn't
object to people solving on the calculator too
strongly, since quite a lot of work had to be
done first in most cases. This week's puzzle,
however, is much more entertaining done by
hand!
