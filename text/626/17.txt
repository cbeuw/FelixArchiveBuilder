EMERGENCY MOTION TO REINSTATE THE LINEN SERVICE.
Proposed by:
Seconded by:
John Palmer, Geology 1.
Olivo Miotto, Physics 2.
3.
ICU Notes:
1. That over the summer vacation the linen service h i t h e r t o
provided i n Student Halls and Houses was discontinued.
2. That the removal of t h i s service c o n s t i t u t e s a hidden
rent increase.
3. That the descision to remove the service was taken by
the Union Council i n c o l l u s i o n with College A u t h o r i t i e s
without p r i o r consultation of the student body.
ICU Believes:
1. The linen service was a valuable one and should not
have been removed.
2. The present laundry f a c i l i t i e s i n Halls and Houses are
woefully inadequate and students w i l l be forced to wash
t h e i r l i n e n at expensive launderettes.
That the excuse of economy that the Union Executive and
College w i l l use to defend t h e i r high handed and
a u t o c r a t i c behaviour i s merely a cover f o r incompetance
and i n e f f i c i e n c y .
ICU Instructs:
The ICU President to negociate the reinstatement of the
linen service under the following conditions:-
i ) A new more economical deal i s negociated with a laundry.
i i ) The administration of the system i s r a t i o n a l i z e d to cut
out waste and i n e f f i c i e n c y .
Introductory Arrangements.
I presented a paper to Board of Studies concerning the
time-tabling of courses f o r the f i r s t two days of term. The
paper was noted and Board of Studies reaffirmed i t s
commitment for two free days at the s t a r t of each session.

Insurance.
This i s being dealt with by John Passmore. There does
appear to be one. or two people gaining access during the
day to College and committing t h e f t s . I f you do see anybody
acting s u p i c i o u s l y inform Security immediately, also do not
leave anything of any value around your department.
Commemoration Day B a l l .
This event went very smoothly (!) thanks to a strong team
e f f o r t from Jo, Jen, Chris T e l l e r , Jo Claydon, Gaynor Lewis
and John Passmore.
AMMENDMENT TO THE EMERGENCY MOTION TO REINSTATE THE LINEN
SERVICE.
Proposed by: Stephen Goulder.
Seconded by: Jon Barnett.
Delete a l l and i n s e r t :
ICU Notes:
1. Had the linen service been retained, the rent increase
for the session would have been 8%.
2. The increase i n rents f o r the session was not more than
4% i n any of the Halls or Houses.
3. The new scheme run by the Southside wardens costs about
30p. a week and provides a f u l l s e r v i c e .
4. Further laundry f a c i l i t i e s have been ordered,
i n s t a l l a t i o n to depend on the date of completion of the
c e n t r a l laundry.
5. The proposed termination of the l i n e n service was
reported to the U.G.M. on the 4th of May, and to the
A.G.M. on the 25th May.
ICU Believes:
1. The various l e v e l s of service offered i n the Halls
should be examined a t the end of the year and the most
appropriate service implemented i n a l l the Halls i n the
future.
