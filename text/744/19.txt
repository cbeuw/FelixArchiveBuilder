Politics Of SDI
Hassled(?) FELIX Reporter
Bill R2D2' Goodwin takes a
look at some of the political
concerns.
The Strategic Defence
Initiative, more commonly
known as Star Wars, is a
huge project comparable in
size to the Apollo
programme. With an annual
budget of $3 billion, it
brings together hundreds
of scientific disciplines in a-
research programme which
aims to make nuclear
weapons 'obsolete and
redundant'. Not
surprisingly, it has raised a
great many questions.
Academics wonder how
much money they can
squeeze from the USA.
Whether they will be able
to publish work that they
do for SDI, and whether
American firms will be able
to 'rip off British ideas.
Peace groups worry that
the deployment of SDI will -
bring about the end of the
A B M (Anti-Ballistic Missile)
treaty and will cause an
escalation in the arms race,
or whether SDI will provide
a Soviet first strike,
scientists wonder if SDI will
work at all, and polticians
are concerned that the
whole project may be a
waste of money. As Tarn
Dalyell MP told FELIX
'Universities such as IC and
Herriot Watt must make up
their mind whether they
want American gold more
than the failure to
participate in a reckless
and unpeaceful
programme'.
In December 1985 Micheal
Heseltine and Casper
Weinburger sigend an
agreement known as the
Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU)
outlining British
involvement in SDI. The
document has been
declared secret in
perpetuity.
Since then West
Germany and Israel have
joined the Star Wars
programme. They too, have
their own M O U
agreements.
P O T O F G O L D ?
One of the myths
concerning SDI is that the
Americans will be handing
over a 'pot of gold'. Before
the M O U was signed
Heseltine was trying to
obtain contracts of $1.5
billion for the UK based on
a list of 18 research areas.'
As the negotiations
proceeded', said Sandy
Verscvow of the US
Embassy, 'It was
recognised that the US
could not set aside money
for any one country'. As a
result Britain will receive
from 7 to 10 industrial
contracts worth an
estimated $30 milllion. It
will also have to compete
for projects in the next
round of research.
'Heseltine expressed
chagrin at the number of
contracts', admitted Mr
Verscvow.
The UK, though has been
given one exclusive project:
the 'European Computer
Architecture' study, worth
Â£7.2m. The study will
consider 'The scientific and
technological possibilities
and obstacles to building
SDI'. The program will, if
successful give Britain the
leading edge in the
competition for the next
research phase.
CLASSIFICATION ?
The secret nature of the
M O U has aroused much
speculation. British
researchers are concerned
that they may be prevented
from publishing any SDI
work they do, and they
wonder what protection
they have against American
firms 'ripping off their
ideas. University academics
are particulary concerned
as their careers depend on
them publishing their
findings. The concept has
been given the buzz words
'Intellectual Property Right'
or IPR. At the hub of the
problem is the question can
the Americans apply
American law in Britain?
The question has become
known as the
'extraterritoriality' debate.
According to the Defence
Procurement Minister John
Lee 'Depending on the
nature of the contractual
arrangements applicable to
each piece of work placed
in the UK, either US or UK
law may apply.' In cases
where extraterritoriality
does apply the U S may /
have the right to classify '
work at any time. Whether
they will apply pressure on
British researchers in the
same way that pressure
was placed on an American
Academic, Andrew Sessler,
to keep his research quiet
during a non-classified
project on electron beams,
is a matter for debate. As
Mr Verscvow pointed out
'one should not make
judgements on individual
cases.'.
T H E M C T L
The Pentagon's attempts to
keep technology from the
Russians have led to the
institution of the Military
Critical Technology List
(MCTL). Technology
placed on the list is subject
to restrictions to prevent it
from falling into the hands
of the Soviet Union. In
February a stir was caused
when Clarence Robinson
arrived in Britain on a
contract to place British
technology on the list,
without the knowledge of
the British Government.
(See FELIX No 733).
Academics at IC were
worried that their work
would be placed on the list
with the result that they
would be prevented from
publishing. As it turned out
Mr Robinson was refused
access to classified work at
G E C and Aerospace by Mr
Hambleton of the M O D
(who was later moved to a
different job). Finally Mr
Robinson was thrown out
of Britain by the US
Embassy. The fact that the
Pentagon felt they had the
right to look at British
Research, because of the
M O U , has caused people
such as Paddy Ashdown
MP to postulate that the
British Government has
been 'hoodwinked'.
Four months earlier in
November, American
representatives visited
Imperial itself. A group
from United Technologies
arrived to inquire about the
areas of research in which
IC was a world leader. A
later visit by representatives
from the Pentagon was
cancelled when academics
from IC sent a letter to Mrs
Thatcher condemning SDI
research, according to
Richard Ennals, who
resigned from IC in protest
over SDI.
T H E M O U
Fears were aroused when
the German M O U was
leaked to the press. The
US, it said, had been given
ultimate control over
classification in Germany.
It was thought that the
British M O U might contain
similar statements. As it
turned out the British
agreement was much more
favourable.
The British M O U was put
Itogether in a hurry, late at
night, and has been
described by one of the
negotiators as a 'very
ideosyncratic document'.
Even so, the British
Government is said to be
pleased with the deal.
Sources who have seen
the M O U have told FELIX
that it contains details of
mutual defence
arrangements, nuclear
weapons, N A T O and
general treaty obligations,
although this is denied at
the American Embassy.
The document has been
kept secret at American
insistence, but has been
shown to companies such
as Marconi who are
deemed to be trustworthy.
The MOD'S SDI office is
prepared to show the M O U
to people it considers
trustworthy in universities,
according to a former
director.
Two clauses are of
particular interest to
academics. The first gives
British researchers a veto
over the American use of
British work. The second is
a proviso that the U S
companies sign an
agreement not to rip off
British work. Richard
Ennals told FELIX,
however, that he felt the
clauses were 'not worth the
paper they are written on'.
He pointed out that British
academics could not refer
to the clauses in a court of
'law given the fact that they
are secret and the
academics in theory would
not known of their
existance.
WILL SDI W O R K ?
The task of producing an
effective missile defence
system is at the very least
difficult. There have been
several studies designed
just to show how difficult.
One such study by the
Massachussetts Institute of
Technology, concluded
that the equipment and fuel
necessarey for a space
based chemical laser
system would take ten
space shuttles making
three trips a year three
thousand years to
assemble. A ground based
system on the other hand
would use 60% of the US
power supply. Perhaps the
most dubious aspect is that
of computing. David Parnas
of the SDIO Panel on
Computing in Support of
Battle Management
resigned his position in
protest against SDI, had
produced a lenghty
document explaining why
the computing side of SDI
won't work. The difficulty
lies in producing ten
million lines of error free
code, bearing in mind that
one error could mean the
start of a nuclear war.
