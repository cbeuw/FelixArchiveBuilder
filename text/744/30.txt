Cycling
Hartigan
Wins
Peter Hartigan fulfilled his
excellent promise by
winning a criterium at R A F
Halton. In a display of
speed and skill on a very
tricky circuit, he just rode
away from the rest of the
field. H e received strong
support from Scott H e y h o e
w h o was unlucky e n o u g h
to crash badly on a gritty
corner a n d was forced to
retire w h e n another rider
rode over his arm whilst he
was on the ground. Before
this incident t h o u g h , the
two riders were easily the
most agrressive in the field
a n d Scott looked set for
s e c o n d place.
In another event at
R e a d i n g , W a y n e M o r l e y
c o n t i n u e d his rapid
improvement by returning a
time of 25-49 in a 10 mile
