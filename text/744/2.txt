Many of you will be
expecting the last FELIX
editorial to be a lenghty
tirade against Carl, Dave
and Quentin. It's not going
to be. One of the things
that you learn as FELIX
Editor is that arguments in
the Union are soon
forgotten. The turnover of
students at any university is
such that within eighteen
months Union arguments
are forgotten. I would
imagine that in two years
few, if any, students will
remember much about this
year. This year has been
one of significant change
for Imperial College, so to
concentrate on the Union
would be profoundly
wrong.
aims of universities.
Students have been hit
by the Government's short
sighted attempts to cut
education. Grants for next
year have only been raised
by 2% in cash terms.
Students have been told
that they may lose their
rights to claim certain
benefits. The government
appears to have decided
that students are easy
targets. A fair proportion of
tory voters believe that
students are lazy dossers
who are trying to avoid
hard work. The effect of the
grants cuts is very obvious.
Many current students
seem to come from middle
and upper class families.
Most current students have
students' lives easier, it is
still the case, though, that
some departments ignore
their students interests. For
example Life Sci still
organise lab session during
the College's official
lunchbreak. This means
that Life Sci students have
problems if they want to sit
on certain Union
committee. They have to be
marked as absent from lab
if they want to attend.
The Union has, as usual,
had problems representing
students on College
committees. Students will
always have problems
when they have to
negotiate with professional
administrators. Student
representatives have to
College that the Union isn't
worth defending.
This year there have
been several'significant
changes in the college
administration. The new
Rector Prof Ash seems
keen to take an interest in
Student affairs. He has
gone to Dramsoc shows
and Rag Fete.
Unfortunately he seems to
be quite good at irritating
some of his staff. Rob
Northey also seems to be
quite good at irritating
people in his new job as
Refectory Manager. It is
difficult to know whether
these two people have
annoyed the right people.
In any organisation there
will be some people who
Â© d t o r i a
In the long term the most
significant thing to happen
to the College was the
U G C ' s decision to cut the
College's funding yet again.
The College has suffered
cuts in funding in real
terms for a number of
years. The cuts are,
causing the College serious
problems. Research at the
College is being cut
because there is no money
for equipment etc. The
College is unable to recruit
the best academics
because it can't afford to
pay them properly an-l in
many cases the College is
unable to replace
academics because it is
having to cut staff. The
recent statements by the
Department of Education
and Science suggests that
next year the Government
may not make any cuts.
While this is good news it
won't prevent severe
damage being done to
higher education.
Universities need to be
properly funded so that
British industry has the
flow of ideas, and
graduates it need. The
majority of the money must
come from the
Government. Industrial
support for universities
normally ties research and
courses to specific short
term needs of industry. It is
up to the Government to
support the longer term
needs of industry by
supporting the longer term
large overdrafts.
One of the disappointing
aspects of the Union this
year has been its failure to
get involved in campaigns
against Government cuts.
External Affairs Officer
Grenville Manuel has tried
hard to organise campaigns
yet apathy on the part of
the majority of Union
Officers (including
sabbaticals) has meant that
IC as usual has hardly been
represented on cuts
campaigns. Indeed Imperial
College Union seems
determined to do as much
harm as it possibly can to
the public's image of the
student by continuing to
sell a Rag Mag that has
been slated in the press, by
organising events like
Morphy Day etc. I really
wonder if the majority of
students care about cuts
because their behaviour
suggests they don't.
Perhaps they feel that they
will have left College by the
time cuts campaigns have
any effect.
College has again shown
a si rt of schizophrenia
wh n dealing with students.
At nines the College has
shown genuine concern
about students interest.
The Undergraduate Studies
Committee has taken a
genuine interests in the
problems faced by
students. The report
produced by the committee
is an attempt to reduce
failure rates and make
learn in a few months skills
which College
administrators have had
years to learn. This year
students reps have been
hampered by a breakdown
in communications within
the Union. Some officers
have virtually stopped
talking to others. Union
officers have had to go to
College committees with
little background
knowledge on the issues to
be discussed because they
hadn't talked to the right
people. Carl, Dave and
Quentin have had their
successes and failures. In
many respects they haven't
been,any worse-than other
sabbaticals. The thing that
has marked this years as
being the worst in a long
time is the split within the
Union. Carl, Dave and
Quentin must take the
blame for this.
More generally the Union
has faced up well to the
problems caused by further
cuts to its funding. The
increases in trading activity
has been very successful.
U F C has been realistic
about the areas that should
be cut. The union has been
successful at trading and
all those involved should be
congratulated. The Union
has, though, lost space
with the FELIX Office being
shunted in to a hole behind
the Lounge. It's just a pity
that sometimes one gets
the impression that there is
so much apathy round the
are dead wood and new
administrators can often
improve things by annoying
these people and getting
them to leave. The
problems come when the
new administrator irritates
efficent colleages. Mr
Northey has made some
improvements though.
Don Ferguson has been
the success of the year. He
has had severe problems at
Student Services but he
has had shown a genuine
interest in student Welfare.
I just hope he doesn't get
depressed about the lack of
support there seems to be
at times from other parts of
the College.
Personally this year has
been enjoyable although at
times there have been
some frustration. There is a
full credit list on the
opposite page and like to
thank all the people
mentioned and anyone else
who has in any way helped
me. See you all next year.
It difficult to know how to
thank people who've put
amazing amounts of works
into FELIX. People have
made real sacrifices for
FELIX. All I can say is that I
really appreciate your
efforts. I hope that you all
still regard me as a friend
after a year in which I've
nagged you all at times.
May I especially thank all
the Union's permanent staff
who've managed to put up
with me despite all my
faults.
