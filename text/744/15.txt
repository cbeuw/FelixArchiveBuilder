Having to sit down and
write an article on next
year's FELIX has brought
home to me how much I
have yet to decide upon
before the start of next
term. More significantly all
the plans I would put
forward—a wider range of
news items, more relevant
feature articles, revitalised
clubs and sports pages,
and a greater emphasis on
student feedback—have
year after year been cited
by the editor-elect as
changes he would like to
introduce. Taking as read
that I will do my best to
institute most of the above,
I should like to emphasise
particularly my aim to
expand the FELIX student
staff. Without question this
year has been one of the
best ever in terms of
recruiting new talent from
the student body. It is very
important to see that this
continues next session, and
-1 will try to ensure that the
FELIX office has a higher
profile at the start of term.
Most of the work on
design and layout of the
paper must be done over
the summer. To ask for any
ideas or criticisms from the
student readership between
now and October is the
most cliched request made
in this column, but I'm
going to make it anyway.
The simple fact that this
appeal rarely meets with
any response makes any
comment you might have
to offer all the more
valuable. Needless to say,
anyone who wishes to work
on FELIX will be greeted
with open arms, or at least
bought a drink. If you are
around College over the
vacation and haven't paid
much attention to the
frenzied activities within
these walls, then take the
opportunity to come in over
the summer when the office
is less hectic. We are
particularly in need of
regular photographers and
cartoonists.
I am aiming to bring out
two 'postgraduate' issues of
FELIX over the summer,
provisionally on Friday
August I and Friday
September 5, thought these
dates may have to be
altered to fit in with the
move of the office. Copy
dealine for these issues will
be one week prior to the
date of publication.
