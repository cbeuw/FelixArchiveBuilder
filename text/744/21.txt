For a man of some-78
years, Max Wall is a
remarkably sharp and
assertive actor and by his
own admission, reluctant to
perform when he is past his
best. Krapp's Laat Tape is
his new production at the
Riverside Studios, part of a
tribute to Samuel Beckett
on his eightieth birthday.
Although it has been ten
years since Wall last
performed the piece, of all
Beckett's plays Krapp's
Laat Tape will be the one
for which he is most
remembered; he chooses to
reflect as much upon his
own varied career as Krapp
does over his 'Lost Love';
'perhaps my best years are
gone, but I wouldn't want
them back, not with the fire
in me now'.
Krapp's Last Tape is a
short play for one man and
a tape recorder. Krapp,
listens to recordings of
himself as a younger man:
the death of his mother and
his lover; little changes for
Krapp; more regretful,
perhaps, but thirty years
on, there is little that he
would want or need to add
to his testimonies. T h e
tapes are the same as those
used ten years previously,
and Wall, a decade on
gives a performance as
precise and as genuine as
these recordings; but with
an even deeper sense of
regret.
Endgame is the second
part of Riverside's tribute to
Beckett. T h e play is set in a
precisely circular room, in
which lives Clov, Hamm
and his parents, each
confined to a dustbin. They
while away their time,
'making progress' towards
some unspecified objective
about which they know
nothing, except that it will
be reached, and shortly.
Clov, spying the arrival of
some character through a
window, prepares to leave
Hamm, but never moves.
The scene is abandoned;
unfinished and unending as
a circle. T h e director
Charlie Hanson, sees fit to
forego any novelties and
concentrates on the
maligned aspect of
Beckett's work: its Irish
humour. T h e meaning
speaks for itself in the
words of the play', says
Hanson. More importantly
the company has
reinterpreted the way in
which they are spoken to
suit as wide an audience as
possible through the use of
comedy. Using a
completely Irish cast,
(except Sylvester Moran as
Hamm), Hanson has made
Endgame into a lightweight
and lucid piece and yet,
surprisingly, it still has that
sense of sober order
characteristic of its time.
This production is a perfect
tribute to one of the
greatest playwrights of this
century.

Road is the best
production that I have
seen. It is fatuous to be
clever with words and try
and detail all that this
unique experience offers;
accept that Road is
brilliant, and go.
'Down Road', a street in a
small Lancashire town, you
move through the painful
and humourous lives of
those who live there. Buy
some chips, watch an old
lady putting on her lipstick,
a skinhead freaking out
about fighting, two young
people who just give up
and die, or just dance with
Scullery (Edward Tudor-
pole). 'You'll meet all-sorts',
for Road allows you to walk
with the cast, to become
part of the experience and
so get closer to it. But
Road is not something
tangible that can be
described, it must be felt,
like it is by those involved;
for the cast aren't acting,
they're being.
'If you're ever in the area
call again.' I'm going to see
Road again and again and
.again.... Simon Lewis
