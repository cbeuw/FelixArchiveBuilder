Welcome to the end of year multicolour
megabrain. Traditionally the last
problems of the year are harder than
usual and this year is no exception.
These problems arc very difficult. Each
has a £10 prize which will be awarded to
a randomly selected winner picked on
Wednesday, July 2. If there are no
Winners by then the prizes will go.to the
first correct entry svsr received! I'm
pretty confidant, though, that none of the
prizes will have to be awarded-good luckl
My thanks go to everbody who's
encouraged me this year and to all
who've helped with idears or puzzles.l'd
especially like to thank Spock (for getting
ms started), Sam, Tony (for one of this
waste's puzzles), and all the people in my
office for putting up with me.
Have a great summer!
