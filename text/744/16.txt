Carl Burgess
The FELIX Interview
Carl Burgess will be remembered by many as a
weak President who was frequently criticised for
his unrepresentative decision-making and poor
personal conduct. In an end-of-session interview
with FELIX last week he reviewed the Union's
achievements and setbacks.
FELIX: Much of your time
is spent on College
committees. How effective
do you think you have
been in representing the
Union at this level?
CB: I think I've done what
I'm supposed to do; put
forward the Union's
viewpoint, or the students'
viewpoint in fact, for
example on issues such
as accommodation. At
Governing Body I've said
that the major problem for
students is the lack of
accommodation available,
and this has been a
prevalent issue for many
years now.
FELIX: The early part of
the year was dominated
by the takeover of the
Union Bar. How
successful financially has
this venture been so far,
and are there, in your
opinion, more ordinary
students using the Bar?
CB: It was very difficult to
build up trade in the
initial instance when we
took it over because there
was so much trouble in
the first term with a
selection of Bar Managers
coming and going, and
various acts of vandalism
and wanton destruction.
With the Bar boycott
occurring it drove a lot of
custom away in the first
place, but ever since we
took over in January there
has been a general
increase in the number of
people coming to the Bar.
It has actually generated
enough money for us to
be able to forecast that
we will be able to build up
the Lounge and have a
more social area instead
of a hacks' bar.
FELIX: This year has been
one of considerable
change around IC. One
aspect of this has been
the arrival of a new
Rector. What is your
opinion of Professor Ash
so far?
FELIX
CB: My opinion of the
Rector is that he's a very,
very keen, well-motivated
and well-meaning person.
He was a student at this
College and he has
various ideas of how it
was then, and he has
been trying to learn
what's actually happening
now. He's visited all the
residences as far as
possible in the time
available, and he's visited
all the departments. He
has taken a very active
interest in academic
standards and in
teaching. He wants to see .
things changing for the
better. He doesn't want to
see us rest on our laurels.
FELIX: At the AGM your
annual report was
referred back and you are
not writing a new one, I
believe...
CB: I was quite glad to
see that people were
there trying to uphold
their beliefs and disagree
with what I said. It makes
a great change. When
people don't even bother
turning up to criticise
what you've
saidâ€”because, I mean, it
was my viewpoint and if
people disagree with it
strongly, which they did,
and were willing to stand
up for their own viewpoint
and get mine defeated
then that's a good thing.
I've put in my Council
report the same AGM
report with the offending
articles removed, so there
would be a record of what
I thought the year had
been like, because the
majority of the report was
accurate and valid in my
view.
FELIX: You've awarded
four UGAs this year, but
not to either of the other
Union Sabbatical Officers.
Is this a sign that you are
at all dissatisfied with the
performances of Dave
Kingston and Quentin
Fontana?
CB: This is not the case
at all. My view of the
Union General Award is
that it is the greatest
award the Union can give,
and it is for services
which go past one single
year. It is an award for
services in all your time at
College. For one year's
work I feel the UGA
would be undervalued.
FELIX: Council has yet to
make a decision on
whether or not to award a
UGA to yourself. Do you
feel that some members
of Council have not fully
appreciated the efforts
you have made this year?
CB: That might have been
my fault for not
communicating as well as
I could have what I'd been
doing, but it's very
difficult to do so. You
have to balance up the
time you've got to write a
report and trie time you
spend doing other things.
Either you spend more
time writing a report and
then you detract from the
time you get to do
something you need to
do, or you leave
something out of your
report and do things but
don't report them.
FELIX: What do you feel
have been your main
failings as President this
year.
CB: My main failing has
been a lack of
communication; I haven't
been able to
communicate properly
with the student body, I
don't think. I have been
able to get on well with
the people in the
Sherfield Building and
express my points very
well and succinctly, but I
haven't been able to
express myself properly,
both on paper and at
UGM's and Council.
FELIX: College Assistant
Secretary Michael Arthur
has expressed some
alarm recently over the
misuse of supermarket
trolleys around College.
Do you share his
concern?
CB: I think Michael's just
over-reacting. It's so
ridiculous. Everybody's
been using trolleys since
time immemorial. You find
them everywhere, all over
the street. You don't even
have to take them from
Wartrose. I mean, they're
the most convenient
mode of transport even
for the Estates workers.
You couldn't do without
trolleys here. I think it's a
classic over-reaction.
FELIX: Finally, Carl, what
is your most prominent
memory of your time at
IC?
CB: I can't remember.
