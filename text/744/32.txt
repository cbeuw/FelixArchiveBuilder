Beanfield, the Stonehenge Festival
will be taking place in some form
or another — if only at the
Magistrate's Court in Winchester.
If you've never been arrested,
had your car impounded and
been beaten around the head
with a riot shield, then here's
your big chance. Seriously, this
event needs all the support it can
get, unless you really want to see
the country degenerate into a
model of South Africa or Russia,
controlled by a set of pass laws.
You can find all about it from
the 'hippies' own publication,
Festival Eye, a snip at only 70p
from the FELIX Office.
A week later, once again at
Milton Keynes Bowl, Marillion
headline a heavy rock bash,
featuring Gary Moore, Magnum,
the really awful Mama's Boys and
'special guests', Jethro Tull in
their new synthetic, shrink-
wrapped cellophane guise
(Tickets £12.00 plus booking fee).
Also on June 28th, Sting, Boy
George, Gary Kemp, the
Communards and Billy Bragg will
be appearing at an Anti-Apartheid
benefit. The free concert is to be
preceded by a march from Hyde
Park, and one of the organisers,
Jerry Dammers said:
"The concert is for the benefit
of those who take part in the
march from Hyde Park which
starts at 1 lam, and I hope that
everyone who goes to the concert
will go on the marchfirst.The
event may be the last of its kind
because after the Police Bill goes
through Parliament, things like
this may not be allowed."
Not content with that lot, on
the very same weekend, London
is treated to the indoor Reggae
Sunsplash. Currently on the line-
up are Alton Ellis, the Wailers,
Aswad, Black Uhuru, King Sounds
and the Israelites (Tickets: £17).
The Editor keeps on telling me
it's really crucial, and feeds
endless reggae tapes into the
ghettoblaster just to prove it.
Of course there's always the
last Wham! gig ever at Wembley
Stadium — the only problem is
that it's already sold out. Bit of a
shame that.
It's good old has-beens time on
July 5th, with Rod Stewart and
ELO, also at Wembley Stadium,
propped up by Feargal Sharkey
and the Blow Monkeys. And the
bad news isn't over there, it costs
£15 to boot, on top of the cost of
the binoculars. More has-beens
follow on July 11th and 12th
with Queen and Status Quo on
their 76th farewell tour. The
Alarm try to achieve rock
immortality by supporting them;
it's probably about the closest
they'll get. If these sell out, which
they look likely to do, there's
another performance at
Knebworth Park on August 9th
• (Tickets: £14.50 plus booking
fee).
Meanwhile, back at another
farm, we have Siouxsie and the
Banshees headlining the WOMAD
Festival (July 18th—20th, Kenn
Pier Farm, Cleveden, near
Bristol). This festival features
some of the world's most
innovative music-makers with
mutant funk band Chakk and
metal bashers 23 Skidoo amongst
others as the English bands.
Back in London, on July 26th
and 27th we have the Damned's
10th Anniversary Tea Party at
Finsbury Park. Thefirstgig
features the suddenly ubiquitous
Dr and the Medics, Screaming
Blue Messiahs and the March
Violets, while the second one has
the Fall, the Mission and Pete
Shelley.
/ndoor rock venues range from
the awful to the really good, the
problem being that some of the
best bands, famous and just
starting out play in the worst
ones. The biggest offenders are
undoubtedly Dingwalls and the
Hammersmith Odeon. The first
features up-and-coming bands,
just about to break big, who have
the problem of playing in a
corridor with a bar at the back
— avoid unless you're really
desperate. The Odeon has all the
bands that have made it while
they crank up to playing the
amphitheatres at Wembley, but it
has all the charm and character
of a derelict aircraft hanger. To
make matters worse it is staffed
by over-zealous bouncers. The
best point about the Odeon is
that it sells tickets for the
cavernous dancing space of the
Hammersmith Palais, even if the
drinks are extortionately
expensive. The Palais is one of
the few venues left of
intermediate size ever since the
sad passing of the Lyceum in
Aldwych. When bands get so big
they have to play places like
Wembley Arena there aren't any
alternatives and you just have to
cope with seeing the band as
pinpoints on the horizon. But at
the small end of the market there
is a nice selection of venues,
which have the cosy cupboard
atmosphere of the Marquee
(probably the cheapest drinks at
any concert) or the greater space
of the Town and Country Club,
although this one is rather
expensive compared to a lot of
similar venues.
Music of a different kind is
offered at the Almeida
International Festival of
Contemporary Music and
Performance, it's been running
for a while, but doesn't finish
until July 6th. Philip Glass, Steve
Reich and John Cage are all part
of the offerings, with a lot of
modern Spanish music.
There's space to give the WH
Smith Cushion Concerts another
plug. For just £3 you get to go *
a classical concert at the Roya
Academy of Arts in Piccadilly,
plus free Admission to a prvate
viewing of the RA's Summer
Exhibition — since that's where
the concerts are held. The
concerts are on Thursday, from
June 26th to July 17th, the
viewing is at 6:30pm and the
concerts at 7:30.
And this is where Capital Ideas
finally leaves you for the time
being. Perhaps we'll be back, and
perhaps we won't.
