AUT
Protest
Fifty members of Imperial
College Staff supported a
national protest against the
Governments policies on
higher Education Last
Thursday. The
Demonstration was
organised by the
Association of University
Teachers (AUT) and who
had limited support from
the A S T M S and N A L G O .
The protest began with a
march from Gordon Square
to the Department of
Education and Science,
where a mock examination
paper was presented to
Education minister Kenneth
Baker, 'Questioning' the
Government on its record
to date. The meeting then
moved on to Central Hall,
where Liberal leader David
Steel, S D P Leader David
Owen, and Labour MP
Giles Radice made
speeches..
The demonstration
proceeded to Westminster
itself where a massive
lobbying exercise was
organised Professor Frank
Leppington of ICAUT, said
that the majority of staff
were members of the A U T ,
but a small number of
representatives from the
other campus Unions had
also attended.

Bar Blues
The transfer of the Union
Bar licence will be delayed
for at least two months.
The licencees were due to
change on July 1, but due
to a misunderstanding of
the requirements for
transfer of the licence the
Union will not be able to
complete the takover for
the Union Bar until early
September.
Union President Carl
Burgess told FELIX that he
had thought that a simple
covering letter from the
College's Licencees would
be adequate to transfer the
bar to the Union's
nominees. In fact the
transfer first requires the
approval of Bar Committee.
This was not discovered
until the deadline of the
Licence application had
arrived.
Mr Burgess commented
that the delay would make
little difference since only
the Summer vacation would
be affected. He explained
that Refectory Manager
Rob Northey, the Current
Licencee, was willing to
keep his name on the
License until after the
takeover could be
confirmed. Mr Burgess
expresed his gratitude to
Mr Northey for his
services.
When the Union takes
full control of bar the
Licensees will be Mrs Jen
Hardy Smith, the Union
Administrator and Dr Bob
Schroter.
Classified Research
Further incidents of the
Strategic Defence Initiative
Organisation (SDIO) trying
to restrict publication of
research work have come
to light recently. Dr Andrew
Sessler of the Lawrence
Livermore Naitonal
Laboratory in American
had to wait one year after
completion of his research
before the SDIO finally
agreed to allow publication.
Dr Sessler is working on
free electron lasers.
In a recent interview Dr
Sessler said that when the
research had reached an
advanced stage, he had
been asked 'to keep quiet'
about his findings even
though the project was not
classified. Originally the
work had been funded by
the Department of Energy.
Dr Sessler said he had
never signed a contract
which imposed restriction
on publication. He thought
that in contract between
Universities and SDI there
would be a clause giving
SDI the right to review any
paper or presentation, prior
to publication with the right
to withold publication, even
if the research was
regarded as unclassified.
Mike
Missing
Concern is growing over
the whereabouts of 2nd
year Met & Mat Sci Student
Mike Smith. Mike, best
known as Captain of the
Motor Club, was last seen
on Friday 30th May.
Suspicion was aroused
when he failed to attend an
exam that afternoon and it
has since proved
impossible to contact him.
Mike's personal tutor, Dr M
G Hocking, has appealed
for any further information
about Mike's whereabouts.

HPV Club Go
To Brighton
Among the thousands of
people joining in the
Annual London to Brighton
Cycle ride last Sunday was
HPV Club member Dave
Larrington Pedalling the
clubs's Windcheetah
reclining trike. The
Windcheetah is one of two
that were pedalled round
the coast of Britain in 1982
and is an attempt to
produce a more efficient
pedal driven vehicle. The
journey down was
undertaken at a modest
pace due to the congestion
on the roads and several
pub stops on the way. The
Windcheetah made a
considerable impact with
its revolutionary layout and
was keenly followed by
assorted TV crews. The fine
weather prompted a
massive turnout which
clogged the route with
cyclists and made the ride
the largest mass cycling
event in the world.
