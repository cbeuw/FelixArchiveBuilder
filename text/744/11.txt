We are extremely
fortunate that jazz music
has evolved side by side
with techniques we may
use to record it. Indeed,
with the exception of the
electronic avant-garde
music, that started in the
late fifties, jazz is possibly
the only form of music to
hold such a claim. It is,
however, unfortunate that
at the birth of this new art-
form, the opportunities for
black performers to record
their work were extremely
scarce. As jazz has evolved,
performers and (especially)
audiences have tended to
forget these roots, or at
best, to pay some token
homage to them, in the
light of better times. Hence
the spirit behind rhythm
and blues-slavery,
segregation and exile-have
been largley displaced by a
modern jazz and
emphasises technique,
syncopation, rhythm,
energy, to a largiey white
audience. Nevertheless, the
driving force behind this
creativity, despite its
development, remains
intact; Jazz was expected
to be about something.
In order to express
themselves clearly, jazz
musicians have used the
human voice to sing, to
speak and to use as an
instrument in itself. Early
singers were
unconstrained; John Lee
Hooker, Leadbelly, Muddy
Waters and later, B B King
sung their injustices to an
eager and receptive black
audience. The pianist, Bud
Powell, frequently moaned
and snarled as he played to
add emphasis to the mood
of his music, rather than
develop his unique but
heavy-handed playing
technique.
In this way, black artist of
the forties, fifties and early
sixties were able to express
themselves with a certain
sense of freedom, and yet
Words To Music
still retain the respect of
white audiences that
allowed them to play in
clubs, restaurants ann bars
and earn a living wage.
Most musicians knew it was
unethical, but if they were
good enough to play in
white clubs, found
themselves with little
option. Other saw it as a
chance to directly
challenge their audiences
with black issues, and it is
not co-incidental that many
of the direct blues singers
were women: Billie Holiday
made Allan's composition
'Strange Fruit' and 'God
Bless the Child' lastingly
famous; referring to the
white jazz-clubs scattered
across Eastern and Middle
American, Bessie Smith
cries (in a live recordin of
'Barrelhouse Blues' given to
an all white audience): '25
cents? Ha! No, no, I
wouldn't pay 25 cents to go
in nowhere!' For those
musicians who staked their
reputation on perfomances
such a these, it was
disheartening to find that,
to a large number of white
musicians, black music was
taboo.
The overwhelming urge
for the black artist to
express himself or herself
unambiguously was
released in the early sixites
by a young saxophonist
called John Coltrane. His
early work with Thelonious
Monk and Miles Davis, with
whom he produced 'Kind
Of Blue', had long
established him as a
talented mainstream
performer. He played
incessantly fast, breaking
bars into sixteenths and
thirty seconds, and
introducing differrent keys,
modes and time signatures
to his own improvisations,
whilst his backing band
beat the time of the original
theme. After a performance
of 'My Favourite Things' at
the Village Vanguard,
critics found themselves
strongly divided over his
talent:
The irrational nature of
Coltrane's playing broke
Jazz music into two. Artist
such as Archie Shepp,
Ornette Coleman and Don
Cherry were directly
influenced by John
Coltrane, creating an
experimental 'Free Form'
jazz that was angry,
challenging and frequently
derise as, for example,
Shepp's 'Rufus (turned his
face to he wind and the
rope broke his neck)'..
Reactionary music such as
this, however, was far more
enigmatic to white
audiences than were the
double-entendres of the
blues-singers twenty years
previously; although of
some interest to musicians,
'The Art Of the
Improvisers', as Coleman
described the movement,
was largely irrelevant.
glissando riffs of free-form
saxophone. Short words
are preferred, in the same
way that a performer will
use single run in notes and
not block chords.
Syncopation is introduced
by rhyming words on
upbeats or at irregular
intervals; monosyllables
also help in this respect,
making the text more
flexible. Colours are
especially important. Apart
from the more obvious
psychedelic connotation,
colours are stronlgy
suggestive of mode, pitch
and timbre, and many
colours juxtaposed with
each other emphasise the
powerful confusion of free-
form jazz and its underlying
spirit:
Jazz poetry has often been
correctly linked to 'Rap',
rhyming couplets spoken
over a simple funk backing
or syncopated drum beat.
Few of these compositions,
however, capture the
essence behind modern
jazz. Early recordings dealt
with black issues;
accomodation,
segregational apartheid. As
'Rap' has developed,
Jazz...America's only true art form.
Far more influential were
those artists who combined
free-form jazz with the
spoken word: Charles
Mingus, Max Roach, Miles
Davis, and the work of Jala
Nuriddin and the Last
Poeters. Using modern jazz
as a medium for poetry,
composers were able to
underline important aspects
of their music in verse,
whilst black poets,
discredited or suppressed
in white literary circles,
used universally admired
musician, such as Herbie
Hancock and Chick Corea
who were rapidly becoming
established in 'funk' and
'jazz fusion', as vehicle for
their work.
Much of the early jazz
poetry draws is material
from transcendental or
narcotic drug experiences,
apocalyptic or prophetic
Christian and Muslim texts
or black political writing.
None of this was original;
bebop singers or 'wailers'
of the forties had delighted
in taking common music-
hall and vaudeville tunes
and plagiarising their lyrics
with surreal images.
Stylistically, however, the
new poetry attempts to
closely imitate the
performing jazz instrument,
indulging in long sections
of text without punctuation
to simulate the chacteristic
however, it has become
more a platform for a
performers ego rather than
political issues. In addition,
'Rap' was conceived with
one principle ambition: to
provide a different form of
music to dance" to, where a
free-form jazz has steadily
professed away from the
constrainst of rhythm.
There are signs, however,
that the new poetry has
come more moderate,
presumbly to influence a
younger generation. Archie
Shepp mixes his live
performances with free-
form jazz and the very
roots of jazz: rhythm and
blues. Gil Scott Heron has
enjoyed a recent rise in
popularity. The new jazz-
revivalists, Working Week,
in corporated Jalal
Nuridden in a new work,
'Stella Marina' for their
debut LP, 'Working Nights'.
Women poets have also
taken to jazz music as a
means of expression, as for
example Maggie Nichols
and The Feminist
Improvising Group, and a
novel recording company,
Stroppy cow. As the
popularity of jazz increases,
spurred on by the spate of
'revivals', there is a strong
chance that Jazz Poetry
may once more develop
and encourage the roots of
black music to grow.
