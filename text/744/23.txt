'He doesn't want us/
Leaving Home is a play
about the family unit and
how the individuals within
it cope with the adversity
and rejection of 'Dad'
walking out on them.
Described as a moving and
funny play, Leaving Home
achieves little in either
direction.
Mum, son, and two
daughters make up the
characters found in the
front room/'iounge of a
Northern seaside home. It
is Christmas, 'Dad' has
been gone for six months
and one of his daughters
Natalie is pregnant, the
other, Greta, forceful and
loud, is obsessed with
finding her lost father.
Colin, 'Dad's' son is a little
strange, he sits at the bus
stop outside of the house
vith a camera slung round
i is neck. Mum is weak and
neurotic. Al! share in their
inr ility to come to terms
with tht loss of 'Dad'; they
need a patriarchal figure.
Colin who knows more
than he is letting on,
introduces his mother to a
down and out, Malcolm,
who quickly takes over the
role of the father figure for
mother and daughter
Natalie. But Greta is
determined to find out why
'Dad' left. The coincidental
arrival of Emma, a potential
house buyer, who thinks
she recognises a picture of
'Dad', sparks off an upset
which reveals that Mum
and Malcolm are thinking
of setting up in a new
house together, that Colin
has seen 'Dad' who doesn't
want his family anymore.
Then Malcolm has what
sounds like a stroke,
Natalie cries for a while,
Colin shouts at Greta
Leaving Home is a
laboured and contrived
piece of writing. The
audience is never
presented with 'Dad's' side
of the story and his family
do little to explain his
actions. The feeling is that
perhaps he never existed at
all. The plot itself is weak,
unrealistic and
unconvincing. Leaving
Home tries to deal with too
many emotions/problems
and fails to present or cope
with any of them. The
actors are severely
restricted as there is little
for them to hang their
chacterisations on.

Elaine Del mar
The Donmar Warehouse,
11pm Saturday 21st June
Elaine Delmar, ably
accompanied by piano,
bass and drums sings from
Gershwin to Fats Waller to
Sondheim. This late night
presentation of Jazz
Cabaret is a pleasure and a
privilege which will be
appreciated by all.
An instrumental overture
is followed by the
appearance of Ms Delmar.
She breaks into a soft pure
voice that sings through
the centre of a note and
tails off into vibrato: 'Some
of my best friends are the
blues..'. Song after song
follows, each interpreted
with consumate skill and
understanding: Windmills
of your mind', 'Killing me
softly, Sweet Georgia
Browp'. «, . •;,
Elaine Delmar is an
accomplished performer,
she gives far more than her
beautifully controlled voice
and this or any other .
opportunity to see her :
should be acted upon.
