administering a Union, has
become such a degraded
activity that those most
able are much more likely
to go off and get a well
paid job, instead of
spending another year as a
'student'. I'm happy to say
that this does not seem to
be the case with next year's
Exec, but the problems will
return in future years
without doubt. Unless
working for other people's
interests can be made more
rewarding (and I don't
mean financially, that is not
so important in our
environment) then Union
administrators on all levels,
from Club Captains to
President will suffer and
when all you 'get from
students is a load of grief
there is no way you are
going to enjoy your job.
So the next time you lose
your temper with the Union
President, remember that
he is human and dislikes
being slagged off as much
as you do, and someone
who gets pissed off with his
job doesn't do his job very
well. I'm as guility of this as
anyone, but I have realised
that this usual distinctive
form of criticism can be
very counter-productive.
Bearing in mind my last 2
columns, my final message
is going to seem a trifle
paradoxical, but
nevertheless, here it
is—Being nice to people
can sometimes produce
surprising results.

A Sideways
Look
(Warning: the opinions
expressed herein are not
necessarily those of the
FELIX Editor or of the
author even. This does not
detract, however, from the
possible veracity of the
arguments put forward)
Having spent my
previous columns slagging
everyone I'm trying to be
nice to someone. To be
more precise I'm going to
be nice to 3 people-namely
this years Exec. This trio of
bastians of the Union have
received no end of stick
since even before this
academic year began.
The cover of the ICU
Handbook, which serves as
an introduction to IC for
many freshers, even
attacked the President,
leading to instant credibility
problems for Carl among
all of the first years. Even
College had its go at the
Exec by trying to ban him
froiTj the usual presidential
place in Linstead Hail, and
there were so many other
reported items on the new
Exec over the Summer that
there is not enough space
to list them. This is hardly
the sort of thing that is
likely to encourage 3
people in positions of
responsibility at the start of
their term of Office!
Then, as the year
progressed, more slagging
off, potential and real
successes or for what ever
reasons, always reported,
and personal animosities
growing all the time.
Looking at it from the
Exec's point of view, when
all they have got for 6
months, is criticism and
complaints its not
surprising that they feel
that all they get from
students is 'a load of grief.
Now it looks up to now if
I'm saying bad news should
not be reported. That's not
what I'm trying to get at.
Our problem at the start of
this year was that personal
animosities and prejudices
caused a lot of damage
before anything got started,
and certainly some of our
current problems have
been inherited from them.
My first plea, dream,
request or whatever, is that
people reporting events or
producing publications
keep personal comments
where they belong-ie out of
factual reporting. Indeed
those are the self same
grounds on which Dave
and Carl's reports were
rejected this year. It's a
principle that could well be
applied elsewhere. (And
since this is a comment
article of a sort I can get
away with it).
Now its all very well to • -*
say that personal
animosities have caused
some of our problems this
year, and its not surprising
that College should take
advantage of the divided
Union in such areas as the
Bot Zoo and FELIX
takeovers, but we should
look at the root of this bad
feeling. It al! starts well
before last year's election,
when the sabbatical
candidates became clear.
The outstanding character
of all the candidates was
their mediocrity. None of
them were especially
experienced in the Union.
Carl had been a joke
candidate for President two
years previously, Quentin's
highest post previously was
Coffee Machine Rep (but in
my humble view has done
the best job of the 3 this
year), and Dave was a
failed Dep Rep. And they
were the best of the lot!
The real problem is not that
the wrong people were
elected, as some of those
who initially dogged the
Exec may think, but that
the Union posts did not
attract people of a sufficent
calibre. I could make a
snide comment about
democracy, but I did that
last week. No, the real
problem is that doing
things essentially for other
people, such as
