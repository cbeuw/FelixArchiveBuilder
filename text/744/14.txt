Love him or
hate him no-
one can deny
that Rex
Reeves has
made an
impact on the
world. In an
exclusive
interview w
FELIX Rex
talks about his
ireer
icluding his
time as a
studeipl^
Colleg
-
When he graduated in 1972 Matthew
J o h n s o n seemed destined to be one of
the world's non-entities. Fourteen years
later he's known as Rex Reeves and and
seen by many as one of the driving
forces behind British rock music of the
70's. He's slightly built, deceptively tall
and totally obnoxious -or at least that is
what the press would have you believe.
On meeting him in person all those
press cuttings seemed so far away from
reality I thought he'd sent a stand in.
Dressed in an immaculate navy blue
suit.his hair permed to hide the thin
patches and sporting stylish red glasses
the former wild man of rock had
obviously c h a n g e d . His features are
remarkably angelic for a man branded
by many as evil and they certainly belie
his thirty five years.
'Just because I don't smash up hotel
rooms and kill annimals with my teeth
I'm s u p p o s e d to have sold out. People
just don't seem to have grasped the
whole statement I was trying to make
through my music. My generation had
everything the kids of the sixties had
but we were robbed of any sense of
"I dedicated my 'wide eyed
and legless' cover version
to leprosy research"
originality -everything had been done
before. Freud was right, it's all a matter
of penis frustration really, we just had
to wait for an opening. T h e quickest
way to s u c c e e d isn't to push hard but to
know where you want to go.' I decided
to let the opening remark pass and ask
him about his time at college.
At Imperial Rex learned all the arts
associated with wine, women and song,
the s e c o n d being an even rarer
commodity then than it is now. It took
him only three lectures to realise that
physics didn't interest him, but in those
days the grant was plentiful and, as this
years ICU President has proved, it
doesn't take much to get a degree in
physics. Music played a very important
part in his life and in those early
experimental days he showed the great
versitility of the bass guitar. He laughed
as he told me that his first band was
called The C o c k r o a c h e s in fond
memory of his room in Beit Hall.
After graduating Rex joined the
countless hoards trying to discover
their true selves. 'The work I did at that
time was full of a primevil energy that
just flowed through me every hour of
the day. It was to attenuate my body to
its etherial frequency that I began to
take L S D and it opened out whole new
vistas for me. It was the gateway to the
work I knew was within me. I had an
irresistible urge to communicate, every
note I produced seemed predestined by
a mighty power. Y o u can't explain that
sort of experience in terms of words.'
This desire to explore the more off-
beat realms of personal experience is
believed to have been partially
responsible for his classification as a
complete nutter by his critics. Rex
spent over three years in the musical
wilderness before he was offered his
first recording contract. It had been his
"It's all a matter of penis
frustration really"
supreme goal but success was ellusive.
'The visual spectacle of my art has
always been as important to me as the
aural. I o n c e bit off the head of a white
swan on stage in Birmingham but you
can't capture that sort of statement on a
record and the film companies just
weren't interested.
It was for the nature of his charity
work that Rex received most flack in the
press. 'I vividly remember the outcry
from the self proclaimed protectors of
public d e c e n c y when I dedicated the
proceeds of my 'wide eyed and legless'
cover version to leprosy research. It's at
times like that when everything you
stand for is being trampled on that you
really find out who your true friends
are. The record c o m p a n y disowned me
and people I had trusted wrote terrible
things about me in the press, claiming I
took drugs, was cruel to animals and
was totally insane. I was outraged at
these lies but I knew the establishment
had been against me ever since my
teacher burned my creative composition
in front of the class.'
Rex was soon blacked b y every
record c o m p a n y in the U K . Desperately
seeking an outlet for his natural
creativity he finally found the role that
has earned him Â£ 2 m in the last five
years. 'I finally feel fulfilled knowing my
work reaches thousands of people
every day. I was overjoyed when I was
given the Mills & Boon contract, though
it sadly caused at lot of problems with
the few friends who had stuck by me. I
felt I was being labelled and refused to
be shoved into a box and forgotten. My
first major work was Hidden Depths and
told the story of a y o u n g checkout girl
who was initially rejected by
authoritarian society but eventually
finds fullfillment by marrying a
policeman. T h e story operates on
several l~-'els depending on the nature
of the reacar. For me the most striking
facet is the total rejection of the
Freudian ethos of sexual causality by
the girl, who insists on maintaining her
virginity until the wedding night. I
further e x p l c e d this theme in my
second book, Forbidden Love, which
explores the conflict between a dockers
daughter and her so called betters
before she finds happiness with the
manager of the fruit canning factory
where she works.' I could see the gleam
in his eye as Rex talked at length of
these major works which were both
nominated for the Jane Lovelace
Memorial Award. At last his great
genius had been acknowledged, a final
defiant gesture to those who call him
insane.
Under his pen name of Victoria Pearl
Rex has recently teamed up with Claire
Raynor (alias Greg 'Pecker' Williams of
T h e Rubbers) to produce a best selling
diet book for the American market. Rex
firmly believes in the high fat, high
carbohydrate, low fibre diet which he
has personaly practiced for the whole
of his life. This tough regime, known as
the Binge Plan, has proved immensely
popular with the health-conscious
"I was overjoyed when I
was given the Mills & Boon
contract"
Americans and Rex will finish a British
edition o n c e he has fully recovered
from his recent heart bypass operation.
Sadly, Rex now acknowledges tba%
his recording career is over having |
fought many battles to maintain his
artistic integrity. His music failed to get
his message but writing has given him a
second chance. He looks back with
affection to the week when he received
twenty thousand fan letters each day
after one appearance on the Old Grey
Whistle Test. Perhaps calling A n n e
Nightingale a stupid bag on air will be
his most lasting claim to fame.
Next week Felix will interview Albert
Sprog, a world famous banana grower
who graduated in civil engineering in
1967.
