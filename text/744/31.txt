J o most of you are going home to
can baked beans or to work for
your sponsors on new ways of
canning beans in the middle of a
bog on Teesside. But there will be
some who stay in London or
hereabouts for whom this is the
cut-out and keep/masticate/
throwaway Capital Ideas.
No more Albanians, not even a
passing reference to King Zog, ten-
headed telephone beasts, or even
the world cup. Admit it, you're sick
of football, endless Cramps gigs
and what Nik Turner did next.
Well here's another batch of
ideas which will have you
reaching for the bucket by the
time you've finished the summer.
Not content with the football
blitz of the past few weeks we
have saturation coverage of
Wimbledon '86 coming up on the
box-in-the-corner. That is if you
don't want to see it in real life.
Seeing a match on the centre
court is often tricky, but some
good tennis can be seen on the
peripheral courts, and it's just
that bit cheaper.
If you want to watch a really
relaxing sport, then there'll be
plenty of cricket at the Oval
(Oval tube) and at Lords (St
John's Wood tube) where the test
match against Pakistan is to be
played this summer.
Still on the sport, away in that
other capital — Edinburgh — the
Commonwealth Games are being
held, as long as the rest of the
Commonwealth don't boycott us
for not boycotting South Africa.
That little show rolls on at the
end of July, to be followed by
the Edinburgh Festival: a city-
wide circus of military tattoos,
concerts and some very odd
plays. The Festival runs from
August 10th—31st, and will
probably be attended by
patronising interviews with the
insipid Russell Harty on
television. Dont't let that drone
put you off, try it in real life — it
costs as little as £17 to get there
on the train.
he summer's a long time to be
able to talk about films, but
there's plenty of opportunity to
recommend cinemas. The general
advice is to avoid the multi-
screen jobs like the
Hammersmith ABC and the
Cannon Chelsea which have a
multitude of screens and films
but very little in the way of leg-
room. Surprisingly enough the
Leicester Square cinemas are
often much better value with
70mm screens, bouncy seats and
real stereo sound. The Empire is
well worth a mention for all these
qualities, with seats ranging from
£2.50—£4.50. A lot of cinemas
do special reductions for Monday

Demo: "I hope that everyone

evening performances, often
around £2.
The 'artier'filmsand the
independents are catered for by
places like the Lumiere (St
Martin's Lane, Leicester Square
tube), the Metro (Rupert St,
Piccadilly tube), the ICA (The
Mall, Charing Cross tube), and
the Roxie (Wardour St, Piccadilly
tube) — which must be one of
the smallest cinemas in existence.
However it does show excellent
independent films in cosy
surroundings.
The owls amongst you might
prefer late-night films — the
Screen on Baker St and the Gate
(Notting Hill) doing some good
11pm onwards bills. For those
with real endurance there are the
all-nighters on Friday and
Saturday nights at places like the
Scala (opposite Kings Cross
Station), the Electric Screen
(Portobello Road, Ladbroke
Grove tube) and the Brixton
Ritzy. For a few smackers you
can get to see four orfivefilms
all through the small hours right
upto breakfast time. Don't forget
your sleeping bags, flasks of
coffee and supplies of food —
you'll need them.
Moving onto the world of the
theatre now, mainstream theatres
tend to be concentrated around
the West End, especially
Shaftesbury Avenue and along
the Strand. They tend to stick to
the tried and tested formulae of
conservative musicals and endless
re-runs of Agatha Cristie stories.
However the Royal Shakespeare
Company often do quite
imaginative versions of old and
new plays at the Barbican
Theatre, which are worth at least
one visit even if it is expensive.
On the other hand Fringe
Theatre has a much greater
range, taking in just about
everybody, from reworkings of
ancient Greek playwrights to first
performances from up-and-
coming authors. Venues which
have become synonymous with
Fringe Theatre, and often house
some very good works are the
Donmar Warehouse (Earlham St,
Covent Garden tube), the Lyric
Studio (King Street,
Hammersmith tube) and the
Riverside Studios (Crisp Road,
Hammersmith tube).
1986 seems to be the year of the
open air concert, with two at
Milton Keynes Bowl within a
week of each other. It all starts
with the Glastonbury CND
Festival from June 20th to the
22nd. Taking place at some farm
near Shepton Mallet it features
the Cure, Level 42 and Simply
Red (Tickets: £17). Also on the
22nd, Simple Minds and Lloyd
Cole play at the Milton Keynes
Bowl (Tickets: £12.50 plus
booking fee).
