I Whatever Happened To...?

On Friday October 18th
FELIX printed a letter from
Dr R Benodekar, a research
assistant in Mechanical
Engineering. Dr Benodekar
wrote 'Whosoever did the
act of cowardice of
throwing a carrier bag full
of water on me, on
Tuesday the 8th October in
the gents toilet on the 7th
floor of Mech Eng at 14.00
should come forward and
let me know what his
intentions were'. These two
innocuous column inches
announced the arrival of a
College personality whose
identity is still.not known.
For a few short weeks the
'Phantom Soaker' was the
most dreaded man in
College.
By the time FELIX was
published on Friday
October 25 there had been
3 more confirmed soakings,
all in the Physics
Department. It then came
to light that the Phantom
had been operating since
mid-September, and 30
'strikes' had already been
reported, largely in the
Sherfield Building. FELIX
received a letter, signed by
the Phantom, claiming
responsibility for the
soaking of Dr Benodekar.
Chief Security Officer
Geoffrey Reeves was
initially reluctant to say
what schemes were being
put into action to catch the
phantom, and only
commented that he was
concerned for his mental
health. This situation
changed one week later
when Mr Reeves himself
became the next Soaker
victim. He told FELIX that
Â£50 of his clothing had
been damaged by the
Soaker and announced his
intention to make the
culprit pay for the damage.
Mr Reeves chanelled all the
available manpower into
the hunt for the Soaker and
took charge of the
investigation personally but
still drew a blank. A second
letter was sent to the FELIX
office, ridiculing the efforts
made to catch him and
naming Tuesday November
19 as the date of his next
strike. Though the
handwriting was different
from that in the previous
letter, Mr Reeves was
I convinced that they were
written by the same person.
On November 19 the
College was rocked by the
news that ICU President
Carl Burgess had been
soaked in the Sherfield
lavatories. This was later
discovered to be a hoax
soak, however, and was not
attributed to the Phantom.
By the end of November
the soakings had ceased.
As mysteriously as he had
begun his reign of terror,
the Phantom disappeared,
leaving Mr Reeves shocked,
stunned, and no nearer to
discovering his identity.
The man behind the plastic
carrier bag is still at large.
Mr Reeves closed the
Soaker case just before
Christmas, convinced that
the soakings were at an
end. FELIX moles were
able to infiltrate the inner
circles of the IC security
organsation and gain
access to Mr Reeves' files.
The extract printed here is
a list of suspects drawn up
by Mr Reeves and gives an
indication of the progress
he had made when the
case was closed.
Soaker File
JOHN SMOOTH
College typist. Not to be trusted. Never answers a
question directly and can talk his way out of any
situation.
ELLEN SHERFIELD
Posing as Rector's personal assistant, in truth the
mastermind behind College administration. Approach
with caution.
ALAN RIDICULOUS
No sense of humour. Takes the Sabbaticals
seriously and likes to think his name is Ludovic
Kennedy.
ROGER PATRONISING
A windbag. Likes seeing his picture in print and
takes cold showers every morning. Believes in God.
MICHAEL ANGELO
A yes man. Power-mad but too dim-witted to get
anywhere. Doesn't realise he is being moved from job to
job until a post is found where he can do no harm.
DAVE KINGSIZEIDIOT
A fruitcake.
