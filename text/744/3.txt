Helpful Pete
Dear Hugh,
I would like to take this
opportunity to thank Pete
Wilson for all the hard work
he has put in as the Union
Welfare Officer this year.
He has been conscientious
on College Committees,
voicing student opinions
and has been enthusiastic
in his support to Student
Welfare and myself, as the
College Welfare Adviser. I
hope next years Welfare
Officer is as helpful and
understanding.

Dear Hagh,
With the advent of the
World Cup, a lot of people
have been invited to 'climb
into the Commentary
Position' during the heat of
a match. Could readers
enlighten me as to whether
this is similar to the
Missionary Position as I
cannot find it anywhere in
The Joy of Sex.

Dear Hugh,
So Recreational Clubs
Committee (RCC)
Chairman Tim Palmer has
proposed a motion for
Joint Council that Athletics
half-colours should be
awarded to students who
compete for Imperial as a
member of clubs that are
outside Athletics Clubs
Committee.
This alone disturbs me.
However, I feel the
intention is not to stop
there; get a foot in the door
and push for full-colours
next time!
I am further disturbed at
the timing of such a
motion. I am ignorant of
the frequency of major
Union meetings, but su; /,
doesn't Joint Council sii at
other times of the year
when such motions can oe
considered with both sides
at their strongest; I get
impression this motion is
being supplied under the
door.
This is not, however, to
say that R C C Club
members should not
receive recognition for their
achievements.
Athletics Clubs
Committee quite rightly
award Athletics colours for
excellence and so surely
shouldn't Recreational
Clubs Committee Clubs
award half and FULL
Recreational colours as
well?
If R C C Clubs are not
satisfied with this and still
demand their Athletics
Colours I suggest that they
join A C C since there is
surely a logical implication
that Athletics Clubs receive
Athletics Colours. Hence,
presumably R C C would
become a sub-committee of
A C C . I am sure all would
be happy with that!
I suspect a degree of
bitching in this matter and jj
so my final suggestion is to
abandon colours
altogether. This would
achieve nothing other than
to appease those who do
not like people being seen
in their eyes to be put on a
higher platform. On the
negative side, much of the
excellence in Sports would
no longer be recognised
and the only way the Union
has of genuinely
recognising those who
bring credit upon the
College would be lost.
S-" give the club
members their deserved
and ap ..ropriate colours
and let us have done with
this so that all the clubs
can get on and do what
they do best.
