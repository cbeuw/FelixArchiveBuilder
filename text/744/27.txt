Thermographic
Measurements, a South
Wirral company, has
introduced the
'Chillchecker', to protect
frozen and chilled goods.
It is most important that
frozen foodstuffs and
medical supplies should
not be thawed out, and
then re-frozen, before they
reach their user. The
Chillchecker is a self-
adhesive disk that can be
applied to frozen goods
before freezing. The
Chillchecker is then
activated by pressing the
centre. Once pressed, the
device changes colour if
subjected to temperatures
above its rating. The
Chillcheckers come in a
range of eight bands from -
17°C to + 2 0 ° C , each band
accurate to within ± 1 ° C .
The only problem is that
the Chillcheckers cost
about 50 pence each,
which adds rather a lot to
the price of a packet of
peas.
Pest
Lecture
On 10'June 1986, Dr G A
Norton (director of Silwood
Centre of Pest
Management) gave the 14th
lecture in the series on
Science and public policy,
which is jointly sponsored
by Imperial College and the
Science Policy Research
Unit. The title was Pesf
management and world
agriculture-research,
extension and policy. In his
lecture Norton highlighted
the relationship between
scientific R and D and
socio-economic factors.
The problem is often
interdisciplinary and close
co-operation with farmers
is essential if methods
formulated are to work. In
the past, however, Pest
Management fias often
been hampered by
scientific 'paradigms' eg the
concept of 'integrated pest
management'. It is Norton's
belief that if future
solutions in pest
management are to be
succesful then a far more
objective approach to the
problems under
consideration will be
needed.
The Week In Science
Time Out Meets Tomorrow's World
World's First Leech Farm
Biopharm (UK), situated in
Swansea, Wales, claims to
be the only leech farm in
the world. The leeches are
bred in their
thousands—current stocks
run to about 30000—and
are exported, mostly for
medical use, throughout
the world.
A zoologist from South
Carolina established the
company to provide
leeches for the
development of the
biochemical and clinical
uses of products derived
from the salivary secretions
of leeches.
In the course of
evolution, leeches have
become specially adapted
to sucking mammalian
blood. As a result they
produce a number of
pharmacologically active
compounds which are
secreted by their salivary
glands and which facilitate
their feeding off the host.
Leeches are already used
in plastic surgey to restore
the circulation in replanted
fingers or ears, where their
action depends on the
active compounds released
by the leech, which help
restore the circulation.
NASA's
Water
Thrust
Despite many setbacks in
space exploration in recent
months, the US National
Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA)
continues it's research into
space travel.
Ground testing of an
auxiliary propulsion system
for NASA's Space Station
has shown that thrusters
can operate for long
periods without hardware
degradation.
The new technology that
has been developed uses
electrolysis of water
onh^ard the Space Station
as the propellant source for
the tfrusters. Water is
broken down into hydrogen
and oxygen, and these
gases are then burnt as
fuel.
Tests >iave been
conducted for NASA's
Lewis Research Centre,
Cleveland, US, by Bell
Aerospace and Aerojet
TechSystem. The two
companies were awarded
parallel contracts last year
to design, fabricate and test
small thrusters based on
technology developed by
NASA's office of
aeronautics and space
technology.
The thrusters ran for
22,000 seconds. NASA's
Space Stations is intende
to last for about 10 years,
so a run of 40,000 to 60,000
seconds is the goal.
Formula Shell Puts Spark In Petrol
For many years the oil
companies have claimed
that their petrol contains a
'secret ingredient'. Now
Shell claims to sell petrol
that reduces fuel
consumption, reduces
exhaust emissions, cleans
the engine and leads to
smoother driving. In the
words of the market
researcher, Shell has
developed a 'unique selling
position'.
Formula Shell contains a
cocktail of surface active
agents: there is a detergent
that keeps the engine
clean; and there is a spark
aider, a potassium
compound that is deposited
on the electrode of the
spark plug, and leads to a
stronger flame kernel in the
spark.
Oil companies started
adding to petrol in the
1920s, when driving
became more and more
popular, the demand for
petrol increased, and oil
refiners had to crack heavy
crude oil fractions to give
petrol grade hydrocarbons.
So Shell's petrol is not
unusual in that all petrols
contain additives. The
claim is that Formula Shell
gives better performance
than the competition.
Road tests have been
performed over 4 million
miles, using 400 different
cars, old and new. The
results show fuel economy
increases of more than 2
per cent, and carbon
monoxide exhaust emission
reduced by 26 per cent.
There was no spark plug
fouling, no degradation in
engine lubricant
performance, and no toxic
potassium salts in the
exhaust, says Shell.
The only effective way to
control exhaust emissions,
however, is by use of
catalytic converters. There
is the three-way converter,
that renders harmless
carbon monoxide, nitrogen
oxides and hydrocarbons.
And there is the 'leanburn'
engine which allows a very
high proportion of air to
petrol, but still requires a
catalyst to remove
hydrocarbons. Whichever
catalytic method is used,
the petrol must be free of
lead: lead poisons platinum
catalysts, as well as
polluting the environment.
This is going to be the
major challenge to oil
refiners in this country, if
and when Britain goes for
lead-free petrol. High
octane unleaded petrol is
expensive to refine, and
low octane unleaded petrol
is expensive to burn.
