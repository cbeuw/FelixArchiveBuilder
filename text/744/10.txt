Summer
Benefits
Welfare Advisor Lesley Gillingham looks
at what you can claim this Summer.
It is now time to think
about claiming money over
the Summer vacation. This
article is designed to give
you an idea of what you
can claim and how to do itl
If you find yourself
confused or in difficulties
then call into Student
Services and see Lesley,
the Welfare Adviser.
Undergraduate Students
Unlike the Christmas and
Easter vacations, there is
no element included in the
student grant to cover
'living expenses' over the
summer vacation and
therefore if you are unable
to find a job you will be
eligible to 'sign on' as
unemployed in the area in
which you are living.
Postgraduate Students
Postgraduate students
can only 'sign on' in the
period that they are not
receiving a grant or
sponsorship. This is often
difficult to prove. However
you should be able to claim
Standard Housing benefit.
Which Benefit
There are three main
types of benefit:
Unemployment Benefit,
Supplementary Benefit and
Housing Benefit. They are
not mutally exclusive and it
is possible to receive two
or in some circumstances
all three types of benefit at
the same time (but only up
to £30.45 plus rent a week
for a single person).
Unemployment Benefit
To be eligible fo> this
benefit you will have to
have paid or been credited
with Class 1 National
Insurance contributions on
earning of at least £1767
between April 1984 and
March 1985. This will give
you a basic rate of £30.45 a
week. (See 'How to claim'
below.
Supplementary Benefit
Supplementary Benefit
was set up as a 'safety net'
for those who did not meet
the conditions for
Unemployment Benefit. It is
now the principal source of
income for a large portion
of the unemployed
including most student
claimants. Eligibility is
dependent on the claimants
ability to 'sign on' as
available for work in the
area in which they live.
There are three rates of
benefit: 'Householder",
'Jointholder' and 'Non
householder'.
Non Householder Most
students living with a
landlady/landlord will be
classed as non
householders. If you are
classified as a non
householder you will
receive a basic rate of
£23.60pw.
Joint Householder
Students sharing flats will
be classed as joint
householders. The benefit
rate for a joint householder
is slightly higher than that
for a non householder and
you will probably receive a
basic rate of approx £25pw.
Householder students
living in individual bedsits
may be classed as
householders. This will give
a basic rate of £29.50pw.
The term 'Householder* is
loose and ill defined and
open to appeal but
obviously the DHSS will
seek to classify students as
non householder where
possible.
Students living in
Colleges Halls of residence
or houses will almost
certainly be classified as
non householders.
How to Claim
On the first weekday of
the vacation go to your
local Unemployment
benefit office (address in
the phone book) and 'sign
on' as available for work.
Take along your P45 (if you
have one) and your
National Insurance number.
They will tell you any
future arrangments for
signing on, and get you to
fill in a number of forms
and give you a B1 claim
form which should be taken
to the local Supplementary
Benefit-Office. The
Supplementary Benefit
Office will probably call
you to an interview and you
will need to take certain
document with you rent
book/receipts (letter from
Students Services if staying
in College accommodation)
and a recent bank
Statement.
Housing Benefit
During the summer
vacation your entitlement
to Housing Benefit will
depend on your
circumstances. If you are
receiving Unemployment
Benefit or Supplementary
Benefit, you should receive
between 80-100% of your
housing costs back through
Certificated Housing
Benefit or through
Standard Housing Benefit
and Housing Benefit
Supplement.
Types of Housing Benefit:
Certificated Housing
Benefit: for those receiving
Supplementary Benefit.
Under this benefit you may
receive 100% of your
housing costs.
Standard Housing Benefit:
anyone can apply for this
benefit if they pay housing
cost. The basic rebate is
60% plus additions if your
income is below the set
'Needs allowance.'.
Housing Benefit
Supplement: an addition to
Standard Housing Benefit
for those who narrowly
miss qualifying for
Supplementary Benefit on
income grounds.
How to Claim
If you are claiming
Unemployment or
Supplementary Benefit: all
you need to do is to make
it clear to the people
dealing with your claim that
you wish to claim Housing
Benefit. They should then
send you all the
appropriate forms to be
completed and returned to
your local Housing
Authority.
If you are N O T claiming
Unemployment or
Supplementary Benefit:
You can still claim
Standard Housing Benefit.
You need to submit a claim
to the local Housing
Authority for the area in
which you are paying rent.
Student Services have
applications forms from
majority of borough. You
cliam will be dated from the
day the Housing Authority
recieves the application
form, you will need to
submit proof of income and
proof of how much rent
you pay.
Useful Information
Holidays Housing Benefit
can be paid during
temporary absences but
you should let the Housing
Benefit office know your
plans. For Unemployment
or Supplementary benefit
you can complete a holiday
form which will allow you
up to sixteen days away
within the Bristish Isles
without losing benefit but
must sign on again as soon
as you get back. If you go
on holiday abroad you will
not be entitled to ANY
Benefit whilst you are out
of the country and you
must start a completely
NEW claim as soon as you
return.
Co-hablting When an
unmarried couple live
together they are treated as
a married couple for benefit
purposes. The Official
reason for this regulation is
to be fair to married
couples, but since a
married couple receive
considerably less than two
single people it is easy to
see another reason for this
regulation. T o avoid being
classed as a couple you
will have to prove that the
two of you live totally
independent, normally you
will have to prove you have
your own rooms.
Appeals if you feel your
benefit has been incorrectly
or unfairly assessed don't
be afraid to appeal. Call
into the Student Services
as soon as possible to
discuss the procedure, a
delay could lose you the
right to appeal.
Remember if you
experience any problems
call Into the student
services office and ask to
see the Welfare Adviser.
Prescription Charges
Many students are eligible
for exemption from
prescription and dental
charges on grounds of
income. It is worth applying
to the DHSS on form FP91
which is available in DHSS
offices and the Health
Centre.
If you application is
turned down it is often
worth asking why, and it
may be worth appealing
against the decision.
If you intend to apply for
exemption keep receipts for
any charges made-you may
be eligible to have the cost
refunded if you are
successful.
Good luck!
