FELIX looks back at the stories which made the headlines
most consistently this year.
The early part of this year was
dominated by the struggle for
control of the Union Building. For
the first few weeks of the autumn
term the front pages of FELIX lead
with the moves to takeover the
Union Bar. Towards. Christmas
negotiations between College
administration and IC Union over
other areas of the Union building
made most of the headlines.
Before term began there was a
dispute over a rise in bar prices,
introduced by Refectory Manager
Rob Northey. Union represent-
atives objected and were able to
negotiate a few reductions. Trouble
flared in Freshers' week when
Union barmen Doug Armstrong
and Brian Ellison resigned because
of a disagreement with Mr Northey
over the running of the bar at the
New Year Party. Student bar staff
reacted angrily when the two
regular barmen were prevented
from working their one month's
notice. The day after the
resignations the first Union
General Meeting of term backed a
proposal for a one week boycott of
all the College bars in protest
against Mr Northey's manage-
ment. Union President Carl
Burgess put forward the view that
the Union should try to takeover
the bar, though he was later able to
deny that the boycott was planned
to help the Union gain control. The
boycott itself was well supported,
with only a handful of students
choosing to drink in any of the
College bars.

agreed to investigate the possibility
of a takeover but immediately
suggested that the issue should be
discussed in 'a wider context' and
said that the use of other rooms
would also be considered. Mr
Smith prepared a draft document
on the takeover which was
submitted and approved at a
meeting of College House
Committee on November 6.
Though Mr Smith presented the
paper jointly with Mr Burgess the
original draft was submitted
unaltered, after Mr Burgess had
decided to ignore ammendments
suggested by other senior Union
Officers. On the day after House
Committee met, Mr Smith sent Mr
Burgess a letter sayng that it was
the College's intention to transfer
control of the Botany-Zoology
Common Room and the Lounge to
the Biology Department. At the
next meeting of ICU Council Mr
Burgess was attacked for not
publicising the details of Mr
Smith's letter before Council met.
He was also criticised for failing to
implement the suggested changes
to the plans for the bar takeover.
Council instructed Mr Burgess to
make it known to College
administration that the transfer of
the rooms did not have Union
approval, and to ask that plans for
the bar takeover be halted until the
matter had been resolved.
Towards the end of the term,
College agreed that the Union
Dining Hall and Senior Common
Room should be used by the
Biology Department as seminar
rooms, but should remain in Union
control. Just before Christmas it
was agreed that there would be a
phased takeover of the Union Bar,
beginning on January 1 and being
finalised on July 1. These schemes
were approved by Council.
Following the resignations of
Doug Armstrong and Brian Ellison
there was a series of personnel
changes in the Union Bar. Mr
Northey first appointed Mr Tony
McVey, who had previously
worked in the refectories, as Bar
Manager. Only two weeks after
being appointed, however, Mr
McVey was dismissed for failing to
open the bar on Saturday night. Mr
McVey told FELIX that he had
been ill with a form of food
poisoning. Former student Dave
Brennan was then made Bar
Manager, only to resign in the
penultimate week of term after
losing £100 of takings. The current
Manager, Mr Moore Lyttle, was
appointed when the Union took
control of the bar in January.
Another story to make news
early in the year was the decision of
the Sabbatical Officers to ban this
years Rag Mag. Union Sabbaticals
are entrusted with the right to
censor the Rag Mag, but only a
portion of the paste-ups were
checked before the publication was
sent to be printed. President Carl
Burgess stepped in to prevent the
sale of the Rag Mag when it was
returned from the printers, a
decision which potentially wasted
the £1500 spent on the Rag Mag. A
motion to reverse the ban was
upheld at the first UGM of the
Professor Manny Lehman
year, however, and Mr Burgess was
censured for failing to edit the most
offensive material.
The involvement of Imperial
College academics in the US
Strategic Defence Intiative ('Star
Wars') has been featured regularly
this year. In October it was
discovered that Emeritus Professor
Manny Lehman of the Computing
Department had signed a contract
to work on SDI. Professor Lehman
said that he thought the US system
was impossible because software of
sufficent size and complexity could
not be built, but that his research
would have enormous benefits for
society. Most of the other DOC
academics disagreed and sent a
The bar takeover
must be discussed
in a wider context
petition to the Prime Minister and
the Financial Times, dissociating
themselves from the project.
Professor Bruce Sayers, Head of
DOC, did not sign the petition but
said that he thought SDI would not
work and that the research might
divert resources away from other
projects. Towards the end of the
spring term, FELIX lead with an
exclusive story explaining how US
officials connected with SDI might
be empowered to classify British
research projects as a result of an
agreement signed by US Defence
Secretary Caspar Weinberger and
former Secretary of State for
Defence Michael Heseltine. More
recently Mr George Gallagher-
Daggitt of the Ministry of Defence
wrote to all British universities
encouraging applications for Star
Wars research contracts, giving the
assurance that there was no danger
of research work being classified.
As yet only three academics from
IC are understood to be chasing
SDI contracts.
In January many of IC's
administrative and academic staff
supported the national day of
action, organised by the
Association of University Teachers
and the National Association of
Local Government Officers, and
took part in the one-day strike. The
AUT was protesting against the
Goverment's poor funding of
Higher Education and was striking
for the first time in its history. The
day of action was acclaimed as very
successful and received the support
of IC Union and of the Rector,
Professor Ash. ICU organised its
own day of protest on January 24
in response to the announcement of
a 2% increase in next year's student
grant and the withdrawal of
students' elegibility to claim
benefits during short vacations.
You know why they like me at ULU?
No Dave?!
Well it's because they can see I've been
doing two jobs. I've been doing both the
President's job and the Deputy
President's job.
This conincided with student
demonstrations instigated by the
NUS all over the country.
Problems in Southside Halls
were again in the news this year. In
the first term residents of Selkirk
and Tizard Halls opposed plans to
convert a small number of rooms
into staircase kitchens. Building
work which was required to bring
the halls into line with fire

Other London Colleges have since
agreed to share the cost of the
service more fully. Though the
details have yet to be finalised,
College Assistant Secretary
Michael Arthur has given the
assurance that the service will not
be closed down.
Recent items of news have
Meeting referred back the annual
reports written by President Carl
Burgess and Deputy President
Dave Kingston.
Finally, it appears that this will
be the last term-time FELIX is
produced in the present office.
College's intention to move the
FELIX office was first made
known shortly after Christmas,
when the move was proposed as a

UDH and SCR as seminar rooms.
Though Council supported FELIX
editor Hugh Southey's objections
to a move of the office, the financial
compensation which College
administration are offering makes
the move difficult to resist. The
Union cannot afford the
reinvestment which is desperately
needed if the Print Unit is to
survive. After 12 years on this site
FELIX is now close to agreeing a
final version of the plans for a new
office in the kitchen area behind the
Lounge.
