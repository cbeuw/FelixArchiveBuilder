Council Chaos
A very low turnout of union representatives meant
that Joint Council could not be held on Monday.
Forty seven people were required to satisfy quorum,
but even at the beginning of the meeting there
were only thirty three voting members present. The
meeting was to have discussed the awarding of the
President's UGA, as well as officers' reports and
awards to members of the Union.
In the event, after
consultation with the
sabbaticals Chairman Hugh
Stiles decided that a
meeting of those present
should be held, using
Council's Standing Orders
and following the same
agenda. However any
decisions taken would have
to be ratified at the first
Council of next term, and
could in principle be
overturned.
President Carl Burgess
and Deputy-President Dave
Kingston submitted new
versions of their annual
reports which had been
referred back at the ICU
Annual General Meeting on
May 22nd. The new reports
had had the offending parts
deleted but the bodies of
the texts remained
unchanged. There were no
objections to the revised
reports and they were
passed provisionally.
Minutes of previous
meeting of the various
minor subcommittees were
read and discussed,
although it was reiterated
that no firm decisions
could be made or matters
arising from them, and that
the meeting could only
indicate its felings to the
incoming Exec, which
would have to make any
decisions on these matters
over the summer.
Some of the scheduled
elections took place
although the elections for
Council Chairman and a
representative to sit on the
Finance and Executive and
Governing Body College
Committee were deemed to
be too important for the
meeting to decide, and
were held over until the
next Council meeting. Pete
Wilson was provisionally
elected as a representative
to the Departmental
Computing Committee,
Steve Flower to the
Humanities Committee, Ian
Howgate to the Students
Residence Committee and
Hugh Southey to Wine
Committee.
Finally outgoing
members of Council were
asked to decide if they
were to vote on the awards.
Hugh Stiles said that this
was the "last chance that
the candidates for awards
would have to be judged by
their peers." The meeting
agreed, although there
were only nine members of
outgoing Council present
out of a theoretical
minimum of twenty four to
vote on them.
The President's U G A was
awarded on a straight vote
without discussion
following a procedural
motion that the question be
put. The matter had been
carried over from the last
Council. Pots were
awarded to Nick Shackley,
Alan Rose and Quentin
Fontana. Honorary Life
Memberships were awarded
to Quentin Fontana, Pascal
Carr, J Martin Taylor and
Dave Kingston for services
to the Union.
After the meeting Hugh
Stiles said that he was very
disappointed with the poor
turnout, the worst that he
had seen in the three years
he had sat on Council. Carl
Burgess was also
disappointed with the
turnout and said that "most
of the recommendations
will go to the Exec meeting
on Friday and since they
will have to make all the
decisions because Council
was inquorate then there is
reason why they can be
criticised for taking them."
He added: "You cannot
expect U G M s to be quorate
but you can usually expect
Council to be." He also
said that Hugh Stiles had
made the right decision to
press ahead with the
judging of awards as this
was the last opportunity for
outgoing Council to
discuss them. He agreed
with Tim Palmer that it was
a farce for nine people to
vote on the awards, but
that those present had
adopted a sensible attitude
to the matters discussed.
President-elect Christine
Taig regarded the meeting
as "a waste of time". She
said that she had submitted
two nominations for .
Honorary Life Memberships
but withdrew them before
walking out, feeling that it
would be an insult to give
awards at such an
unrepresentative meeting.
She added that she had a
lot of sympathy with Hugh
Stiles but believes
"decisions were taken
which would have gone
otherwise had the meeting
been qucfrate."
Honorary Secretary
Quentin Fontana also
walked out of the meeting
in disgust, to return later.
He was very disappointed,
especially as Â£35 of Union
money and two days of his
time had been wasted on
preparing the Council
papers which had gone
largely unused.
Council is a committee of 48 elected representatives of the
Union, including the Sabbaticals, CCU Presidents, Officers
(including Welfare, Womens', Academic Affairs etc.) and
Dep Reps. As such it has the highest powers of any
committee, and is responsible for any changes in the
Union. All of the officers have to report to Council at its
regular monthly meetings, including the President All
decisions have to be ratified by Council except under
extenuating circumstances.
FELIX Wednesday 18 June 5
