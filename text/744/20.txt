In last week's FELIX Physics Dep Rep Simon Singh was
attacked by Anon of Ibid In his column 'A Sideways Look'.
This week Mr Singh responds. Take It away Simon....
Last week's FELIX
contained an article which
raised several points
concerning the setting up
and funding of a new
Physics departmental
student common room.
Hopefully, the following
brief paragraphs will put
people's minds at rest
concerning the common
room as many of the
conclusions stated were
either illogical or else
based on false information.
Anon of Ibid's first
statement claims that the
Physics Department is only -
prepared to fund the
student common room in
order 'to appease the
seething masses' by 'doing
very little'. The Department
is in fact investing £2000 in
the common room venture
and to suggest that
members of academic staff
are willing to throw £2000
at undergraduates in order
to keep them happy is
foolish and naive. The
quantity of money in
question is approximately
one quarter of the budget
of any of the C C U ' s . We
are not dealing with petty
cash but rather in terms of
a major Departmental
donation. The Physics
department has already
subsidised student
publications, parties, discos
and sporting events. Its
reputation in the College is
high with respect to
student welfare and it really
has no need for a cosmetic
approach to student
politics.
Anon of Ibid states that
the common room is an
insufficient facility, bearing
in mind that the department
has 600 undergraduates.
This is true! But in a time
when other departments
are losing their common
rooms and postgraduate
facilities are also
dissappearing surely it is
better to have some kind of
common room than none at
all. Over three quarters of
first and second year
undergraduates were in
favour of spending any
available money on new
common room facilities as
opposed to computers,
library books or laboratory
equipment.
The major conclusion of
last week's article was the
claim that the whole
common room venture was
a clever political ploy on
my behalf to win the R C S
presidential election. The
election was on March 3rd.
The common room was not
given the go ahead until
the following term and was
not announced in FELIX
until May 5th, nor in
Schrodingers Cat (Physics
newsletter) until May 9th.
Despite the many talents of
the students in R C S , I am
afraid clairvoyance,
telepathy and the ability to
predict are still alien to
most undergraduates. Why
does last week's author find
it necessary to view any
achievement as suspicious
and motivated by
selfishness?...surely this is
judgement at its most
perverse.
Lastly, although
criticising Dep Reps is the
right of every member of
the Union taking
anonymous potshots at
innocent first year
Academic Reps is a
contemptable act.
Wei I....sorry to have
babbled on for so long on a
subject which is relevant
only to physicists but I am
afraid that until people
realise that FELIX is not the
place for petty personal
vendettas, there is little else
that can be done.
Dep Reps as a whole
have had a pretty poor
image over the past year.
Dave Kingston described
us collectively as a 'rabble'
in his annual report and
there have been many
criticisms of poor
attendance by Dep Reps at
important Union committee
meetings. What has been
going wrong?
Dep Reps are essentially
dedicated to departmental
issues concerning their
'constituents' and they are
often the first direct contact
freshers have with ICU or
the C C U s . In many ways
the Dep Rep is the ideal
person to purvey all that is
good about student unions.
But in many departments
the Dep Rep is seen to be
an isolated figure, who isn't
really fully integrated into
the Union hierarachy....a
rather queer animal with no
real place amongst 'the real
hacks'.
Most IC Union posts are
held by IC Union 'hacks'. A
friendly bunch of students
who work damn hard on
our behalf. These people
have to work together and
regularly meet up socially.
Often election to such
position is from within the
ranks, and at least in this
way students can be
assured that a sensible
approach is taken to the
job in question. A similar
system works within the
C C U s . Dep Reps are an
anomaly in the electoral
procedure. They tend to be
faces familiar within the
department but generally
unknown outside that
particular environment.
Consequently when
attending major Union
committees it is easy for
Dep Reps to feel
intimidated and isolated.
They don't feel confident
enough to sit with the ICU
or C C U hacks and Dep
Reps rarely know each
other well enough to form
their own cliques.
I know Christine Taig is
keen to nurture Dep Rep
involvement next year and
hopefully I can do my best
to get R C S Dep Reps in
particular to act as a unit.
Dep Reps actually
represent us on Council in
the most direct manner
possible. Their influence
and responsibilities next
year could be significant.
With Dep Reps having a
higher profile Academic
and Sdfeial Reps would
immediately benefit from
working with an influential
Council member, perhaps
with a College-wide
reputation.
I have spent the last year
as Dep Rep for 600
undergraduates and 150
postgraduates. It's been
great fun and very
rewarding. I was fortunate
to know a few other
Council members before I
began had I not perhaps
things would have been
different!!!

ps Should Anon of Ibid be
prepared to reveal his/her
identity I would be most
pleased to meet him/her in
open debate. I am sure that
the students of IC would
appreciate a good old
bitching session!!
