Nobody in College is
certain what will happen in 1
the twenty years time. In
the last twenty years the
i universities have gone
through massive expansion
following the Robins
report and then contraction
in recent years under the
Thatcher government so
nobody can realistically
predict in any detail what
I IC will be like in fifteen or
I twenty years. A new

' good as mine.'
change are the research
and teaching subject. A s
the College plan says 'new
research areas and new
subjects at both
undergraduate and
postgraduates levels must
be established and
encouraged.'. The College
plan is aimed at operating
'sufficent flexibility to allow
resources to be moved
from contracting to new
and expanding activities'. In
other words College
believes that they have to
plan so that they can keep
the College at the forefront
of techonology. Prof Cole,
Dean of R C S , told FELIX
that 'there are people who
are waiting for a
'because the
future is hard to
fortell, it isn't a
good excuse for
not having a plan'
The College has to
attempt to overcome these
problems though and plan
for the future. Ever since
the Jarett report on
increasing officiency in
higher education, the
College has been expected
to have a cohesive strategy
for the future. The College
has a Development
Planning Group which is
meant to look at strategy
for developing the College
and there is a College plan
containing submission by
all of the department etc
about their plans for the
future. This means that one
can make some general
predictions about future of
the College. Although as
the Rector Prof Ash said
'because the future is so
uncertain all planning will
be subject to what actually
happens next and we are
quite likely to find
ourselves going along
paths somewhat different
from those envisaged'. He
added though that 'it is
very important to stress
that just because the future
is hard to fortell, it isn't a
good excuse for not having
a plan'.
It seems to be generally
agreed thai the actual
numbers of students and
the balance between
postgraduates and
undergraduates won't
change substantially. Prof
Ash believes that College
will expand the student
numbers but will be limited
to restrictions on the site.
What does seem likely to
bandwagon to jump on.
What makes IC a very
exciting place is we do
expect to create are own
new bandwagons'.
There are several factors
that academics fear could
prevent IC remaining at the
forefront of science and
engineering. Firstly there is
the fear that further cuts in
university funding will be
so damage IC that it will be
unable to finance changes
in the research being
carried out in the College.
Prof Brown, Dean of R S M
said that his biggest fear
for the future of IC was that
'Maggie Thatcher will be
IC: Has

would go. This could be
done by closing one
medium size department or
by natural wastage across
'biggest fear for
the future of IC
was that 'Maggie
Thatcher will be
re-elected'
re-elected'. When the U G C
wrote to IC several yeas
ago, the College replied
saying that
• Level Funding would
prevent any major
expansions. Any new areas
of activity would mean cuts
elsewhere in the College.
No new 4 year courses
could be developed and
some areas of research
'valuable to the community'
could not be pursued.
• one percent cut for five
all departments. If done by
wastage then staff loses
would be uneven and
therefore in certain areas
that would be no expertise
and courses would have
their syllabus changed.
• T w o per cent every year
for five years 80 academics
staff would have to go,
resulting in the closure of
two medium sized
departments or a natural
wastage policy so severe
that most undergraduate
courses would have to be
downgraded or even
withdrawn. In addition it
would be unlikely that all
the College buildings could
be maintained-one would
have to be sold or
demolished. This year the
college was cut by over 3%.
Professor Ash described
this year's university cuts
as 'Bad, there simply isn't
enough money to go
round. Against that
background I think that
Imperial College has done
really rather well....The
judgement that has been
made on our research puts
us on the same level as
Oxford, Cambridge and
University College...If we
were to have similar cuts
for the next five years the
effects would be
disasterous. | think we can
see the magnitude of the
disaster I'd prefer to guess
at the vector because thats
something one would have
to face if it was going to
happen.

'If can't have any other

this worry.
'I think it is a pity financial
contrainsts make associate

times'.
Yet things are not as bad
as they could be. Sir Keith
Joseph made several
Minister.
Professor Ash along with
many observers of the
situation beleives that more
money will be available
next year. 'I think it has
become evident that
education is an issue on
which votes will depend
and I believe therefore that
it is probably that there will
be additional funding for
the universities. I hope
there will be enough
funding so that for a little
while at least we can go
along on a constant income
basis.
IC has anyway come off
better than many other
universities. In the most
recent load of cuts a
number of univeristies were
cut, by over 5% in real
terms, and are warning that
they will be bankrupted.
Prof Sayers thought that IC
would 'find ways round the
fiancial issue...difficult and
unpleasant though it will be
and everyone will suffer'.
One way to increase
income is to sell research.
As Prof Cole put it 'We
ought to recongnise that
scientific information is a
commodity'. The College
commissioned a report
called 'Commercialization
of Research At Imperial

they can very often not
look in their own
laboratories at a horizon
that is more than about two
or three years away. It is
precisely to help them to
see what will happen in the
next ten years that will turn
to universities and this is
precisely the sort of
interaction that I am
interested in fostering.
Which doesn't alter the fact
that in engineering
departments it is perfectly .
appropriate to be working
on stimulating and creative
research that will find
application in the short
term... most people who

Consultants. Academics,
though, have expressed
fear that basic
fundunamental research
might be sacrificed. Prof
Brown said 'I am worried
about the increasing
pressure that there is on
staff to do reasearch for
commercial purposes
rather than research for
I know that some
members of the Governing
Body and some
administrators seem to
think that is why research
is done or should be done
and I'm one member of the
staff who's not happy about
it. Prof Coles said that he
was worried that industry
expected universities to do
research that produced
marketably products within
. seven years and was also
unwilling to pay. Prof
Sayers defends for informal
research. 'If we say right
this is part of our duty at
national level then the way
in which we use our time
and the way in extent to
which public money is used
and the extend can exploit
research and do expolit
our research by choice will
I think fall into place'.
Professor Ash argues that
this shouldn't necessarily
mean a greater
concentration on-short
term research. 'Industrial
Research laboratories have
have been involved in
funding research realise the
fact that getting money is
easy. What you need to do
is get money to do the
things you want to do and I
have great confidence in
my colleagues at IC that
they will succeed in doing
the later'.
The other major threat to
the College staying at the
forefront of science and
technology is pay for as
everyone must know
academics are paid
significantly less than their
counterparts in industry.
For example in Petroleum
Engineering academics are
payed roughly half what
their counterparts in
industry are paid. College
academics are worried even
if the money was available
to recruit their succesors,
nobody of sufficient quality
would apply.
They are particularly
worried that although
talented people may be
tempted to work as
academics for a short
period, in the long term the
limited promotion"
opportunities and the poor
rates of pay for senior
lecturers and readers will
mean that few people plan
to make a career in
industry.
