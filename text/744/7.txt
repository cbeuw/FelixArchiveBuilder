Housing Benefits In
Danger
Students may be unable to
claim Housing Benefits this
Summer owing to
Government delays. Next
year's grant cheques are
also unlikely to reach
students by the start of
term.
According to a report in
the Guardian, Social
Security Offices are unable
to pay housing benefit until
the Government's policy is
announced. Similarly, Local
Education Authorities
cannot deal with grant
applications until the
Government's regulations
are passed through
Parliament.
The Government initially
intended to replace
housing benefit with a £36
increase in the annual
grant; If implemented this
could mean that some
students may lose £720 per
year. In the wake of
unfavourable reports by the
Social Security Advisory
Committee, the
Government's plans are
under review and the
Department of Education is
trying to increase the £36
limit.
Libraries Moore
The Lyon Playfair and
Haldane Libraries are to be
computerised in July 1986.
A single barcoded library
card will be issued to
borrowers for both
Libraries. Periodicals,
Records and Tapes,
Reports Series and some of
the smaller specialist
collections will not be on
the system, but will
continue to be issued on
the present systems. The
librarians hope to have
most of the library cards
ready by the beginning of
the next academic year.
Natural
History
Charges
Visitors to the Natural
History Museum,
Geological Museum and
the Zoological Museum will
have to pay admission
charges from April 1987.
The Trades Union at the
Museums have started a
campaign against the
introduction of admission
charges and are demanding
improved funding for the
museums. The Unions are
circulating a petition
addressed to the Trustees
of the British Museum
(Natural History). There is
a copy in the FELIX Office
for anyone who would like
to add their name to the
petition.
Moore Lyttle has resigned
his position as Union Bar
Manager. He has resigned
because of personal
reasons and is due to leave
on July 3rd. Union
President Carl Burgess and
Deputy President Dave
Kingston have expressed
their regrets at Mr Lyttle's
departure.
Breast
Screen
The Health Service has
established a breast
screening programme for
female members of College
over 35. It is being run with
the cooperation of the
Royal Marsden Hospital
and includes a
mammograph, a sort of X-
ray. Women wishing to put
their name on the waiting
list should contact
Elizabeth Pask on
extension 3088. A small
donation is required and
the Health Service expects
there to be some delay as
places are limited and
interest is considerable.
Ferry Tale
Students wishing to travel
abroad with a car can travel
at reduced fares on Sealink
Ferries. The offer enables
students with valid
International Student
Indentity cards to travel
from Dover to Calais or
from Folkestone to
Boulogne. Details can be
obtained from Sealink on

4% Rise In
Subvention
An increase of 4% in IC
Union's funding was
confirmed by the College
Governing Body and the
Finance and Executive
Committees on Friday. The
Union will receive £250,000
next year, as opposed to
the £238,000 last year.
The increase in the
Union's subvention had
been anticipated and was
taken into account at the
emergency meeting of the
Union Finance Committee
two weeks ago, where it
was decided not to
completely withdraw funds
from any clubs. Union
Deputy President pave
Kingston was nevertheless
relieved at the news of the
increase. 'It is now almost
certain that we won't have
to make any more cuts next
year,' he commented.
