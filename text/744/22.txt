Mephisto
The extraordinary thing
about Mephisto is that, no
matter how many
productions I attend, I can
never remember having
seen it before. Bill
Alexander's production is
particularly forgettable.
Mephisto is the story of an
actor in Hitler's Germany,
struggling for recogniiton
and respect in Berlin,
against his liberal and
revolutionary beliefs. This"
production, however, does
little to highlight his
predicament, but shifts the
emphasis of the,play
towards surrounding
events. The result is that
whilst the play movingly
documents the demise of
revolutionary Theatre In the
"years preceding the
Second World War, the
centra) parallels between
Marlowe's tragedy, Fault in
a souless country under
dictatorial rule, a n d the 1
\)
reversed roles of the actor
on stage and in real life are
sadly upstaged by agitprop
tomfoolery. Cllve Merrison
provides some excellent -
performances and the cast
coped well with a
diminished set, but this
fragmented production, has
little to offer save a tired / \
ambience. J o h n B u r g e 8 8
The Golden Oriole
The Golden Oriole by H E
Bates is a beautiful and
enchanting book of five
love stories, each in its own
way extraordinary. The
people are described as
'unremarkable' in the blurb,
but every central character
in this quintet is an oddball.
There is the man whose
true love is a Rhode Island
Red Hen, Georgina; who
roosts in the front room
harmonium. Fed on
whiskey with coffee beans
and cream mash, the hen is
eventually ousted by an
equally hennish widow
from across the road.
If you think that's normal,
there is always the woman
who hides from her
husband every night when
he comes home from the
office, waiting to be found
by him, and yet he has
never seen her naked. Then
there is 'The Quiet Girl', a
seamstress, who almost
through her quietness and
lassitude gets a lover, then
goes out and gets another,
before the third, and most
disturbing, man in her life
arrives.
The other two stories
both involve young men,
the first seeking freedom
from the memory of his
father's death. The other, a
philosophy student from
Oxford, hitches a ride from
a parasitic lorry driver, who
seems to have
understanding relationships
with most of the women
who live alongside the A4.
All these stories
emphasise how much
human activity is a blind
delving for love of any kind.
They are truly exquisite
stories, with tone, rhythm,
detail and character, and
yet sad, as the mortal love
these people have is only
transitory and it is
frequently wrenched from
them. Well worth the Â£1.95
price as the stories are so
bountiful they are always
good for a reread. This is
published by Penguin and
available from most good
sized bookshops.ifFinally, if
you hadn't noticed, it's the
2nd International Feminist
Book Fortnight, so scan
Time Out, City Limits and
L A M for details of feminist
activities.

POLICE-
Police, a French
film,stars the ubiquitous
Gerard Depardieu as
Inspector Mangin
investigating a drug ring. In
the course of his daily
duties he becomes involved
with the girlfriend of the
chief suspect and manages
to convince himself, against
all the evidence, that she is
innocent. T o o late he
discovers that she is a
compulsive liar. From the
opening claustrophobic
interrogation scene the
audience is thrown into a
bumper car ride through
exotic characters. The
acting throughout is
remarkable, young Sophie
Merleau is brilliant. The
use of improvisation by
Maurice Pialat, the director
results in a plot that feels
as if it is of secondary
importance. However, this
technique allows for some
very moving performances,
and Police is a good film
and well worth seeing.
Now we get on to the
brieflys. Compromising
Positions is a comedy and
with a name like that I was
expecting pretty dreadful
things from it especially
when I discovered that the
story concerns the murder
of a flirtatious dentist.
However, it is slowly
revealed that the dentist is
having affairs with virtually
every patient and further
that he is involved with
pornography. This was not
a great film but I found it
quite fresh and pretty fun,
and I think I particularly
enjoyed this film because it
gave all the good lines to
women, unusual for a
Hollywood film. Static,
(Cannon Chelsea, Electric
Screen) is a very
entertaining but odd film
about a person who invents
a 'television' that shows
heaven. It has some
wonderful lines: 'Good to
meet you Miss Julie I hope
your death is painless'. I
also really liked the idea of
the collection of deformed
crucifixes. Go and see it
and find out!
Films to look forward to
over the Summer include
Kunchalorsky's 'Runaway
Train' (June 27),
Spielberg's 'The Colour
Purple' (July 11), Woody
Allen's 'Hannah and her
Sisters' (July 18)
Finally Jim's list of 12 of
the best films to have
opened this year (in no
particular order): My
Beautiful Launderette,
Silverado, Defence of the
Realm, Colonel Redl,
Jagged Edge, No
Surrender, Heartbreakers,
Room with a View, The
Lightship, T o Live and Die
in L A and After Hours.
