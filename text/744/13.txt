D Hugh Southey began working
on FELIX as soon as he arrived
at College four years ago. The
fresh-faced chemical engineer
gave evidence of his irrational
enthusiasm early on by sticking
to the mind-blowingly tedious
job of 'What's On' editor for six
months.
Throughout the three years
before he became editor, Hugh
was one of the most dedicated
self-publicists in College. As
well as sitting on most of the
important Union committees,
Hugh made sure he was never
out of the news. In his second
year he was pictured on the
front page of FELIX, having
saved an injured pigeon from
being run over in Prince
Consort Road. (The wretched
bird was bumped off shortly
afterwards, but this was not
recorded).
Despite his broad experience
of College life, Hugh has always
been uncontrollably nervous
and fidgety, and has great
difficulty standing still for more
than a few seconds. This is due
to a combination of his youthful
exuberance and limited sex life.
Recently he spent six weeks
trying to find a partner for the
College Dinner, and ended up
taking a friend's fiance. (Anyone
who might be interested in
accompanying Hugh on the
weekend for two in Paris which
he won in the Rag Fete raffle
should contact the FELIX
Office).
By his third year Hugh had
made such a good job of
blowing his own trumpet that he
won the election for FELIX
editor by a landslide majority
though the fact that his main
rival had never entered the
office before might have aided
his easy win. Hugh celebrated
his truimph by getting
hopelessly drunk and screaming
'No, no, no!' at the top of his
voice, whilst standing in the
middle of Princes Gardens at
2am. He began his reign as
editor by subjecting the staff to
a constant barrage of his limited
musical tastes. Our ears were
constantly assailed by his 'gang
of four' tapes, played in
continual rotation. Hugh's other
antisocial habits include
continually neglecting to do the
washing up and a sadistic
knack of farting in the camera
room.
Hugh is something of an IC
Radio hack and last year took
part in a 'strip for Rag' show
with several other IC
notables—Hugh's bum beamed
forth from the following issue of
FELIX. Four of the charitable
exhibitionists then decided to
A Profile
By The Staff
round off the evening by
sharing a bed for the night.
Suffice it to say that when one
of this close circle of friends
decided to g* n a m e d Hugh ^
was the imme ate choice for
'best man'.
A devout follower of Chealsea
FC and Middlesex, Hugh's
secret desire is to be a
combination of Kerry Dixon and
Mike Gatting. Though he lead
the FELIX football team to their
first ever victory last year his
cricketing prowess is rather
basic. Whilst playing in the
annual FELIX fixture he was
struck on the head by a 'fast'
bowler after losing sight of the
ball completely. Thougn it was
gently pointed out to hi 'iter
that the ball was a slow Ic. j-
hop Hugh, is still convince • that
he narrowly avoided serious
injury from a bowler of Lillian
pace.
Hugh has, though, found <
>
special niche in the IC Hockey
3rds this year. It was during a
game with these intrepid
sportsmen that he was struck
by an opponent's stick and had
his thumb broken. After proudly
parading his heavily strapped
injury for a week, Hugh decided
he was 'match-fit' once again
and returned to the ranks. St
Steven's were not impressed
when he turned up in casualty
with a second fracture of the
same thumb.
This year, not least because
of an endless series of technical
problems, Hugh has had to put
in an immense amount of time
in order to bring FELIX out
every Friday. At six o'clock on
the evening before publication
of the penultimate issue only
one sheet of FELIX was printed
and the litho had refused to
work for the last six hours. Any
normal person would have
given up and brought FELIX out
on Monday, but with what
seemed like bloody-minded
stubborness at the time, Hugh
perservered and finally got the
machine running.
