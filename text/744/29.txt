and improve the situation.
The relucatnce, though, of
the Government to spend
extra money on universities
means that it is difficult to
see how the universities
improve the academics pay.

the benefit to the taxpayer
justified the cost. Most
college academics believe
this to be wrong and insist
that the Robins principle be
upheld.
One area where there
seems to be prospects of
real change is ;
undergraduate teaching.
The College has a
reputation for low teaching
standards. Many academics
feel that this is unfair. Prof
Sayers for example
described the teaching
standards as good as any
university he'd been at.
Carl Burgess, though, felt
something needed to be
done to improve the
teaching standards.
In an attempt, to, look at
ways of improving the
teaching standards, as
committee was set up,
under the chairmanship of
Prof Blow, to look at
undergraduate studies. The
first report of this
committee, the
Undergraduate Studies
Committee, was recently
published. As reported in
FELIX, this made several
radical proposals including
awarding certificates of
excellence in teaching to
lecturers based on their
students assessment of
their teaching; the
requirement that lecturers
get two such certificates
before they can get
promoted, the limiting of
academic work to fourty
hours a week; the
introduction of a course
unit system in engineering.
All the people
interviewed by FELIX were
impressed by the report.
Professor Ash described it
as excellant. There were,
though, some criticisms of
it. Prof Sayers felt that
students were not the best
way to test a lecturers
ability. In his view when
students go into industry
their opinions about who is
a good and who is a bad
lecturer change. Prof
Brown was worried that
forty four hours a week was
insufficient.
One area of College that
seems set for very little
fundamental change is the
Union. Most of the people
interviewed were pleased
with the Union's
performance and felt that it
was fulfilling a dual role
representing students and
organising social events.
