the end of the exhibition we are
presented with a short video.
Entitled Imagineering, and produced
by the government, it highlights
the importance of imagination as
a source of wealth. Fujiwara shows
us how we have moved, through
the years, from coal to creativity,
and explores what happens when
happiness is treated as just another
commodity.
Other curators represent British
institutions in different ways, be it in
a positive or negative light. Hannah
Starkey takes the Arts Council
Collection as her starting point; the
world’s largest loan collection of
British modern and contemporary
art, it is the Collection’s wide range
of photographs that have provided
the inspiration for Starkey’s witty,
bleak view of modern Britain. Like
Fujiwara, Starkey attempts to portray
a country that has fallen in love
with the allure of consumerism,
contrasting images taken from
advertising with grim photos, often
in black and white, showing social
isolation and alienation.
One of the highlights of Starkey’s
collection are Paul Graham’s
photographs, taken in social security
offices around the country in
the mid-80s. With their decrepit
atmosphere, the photos highlight –
in garish technicolour – those who
have been abandoned by a welfare
state that promised so much for
so many. Elsewhere we have Chris
Killip’s images; in one, a woman lies
face down on a wooden bench, her
skirt being blustered by an invisible
wind; in another, a crying child from
Tyneside brings his knees up to his
face, displaying his worn boots to the
camera.
Whilst Starkey shows the worst
of Britain, she also shows us some
of the best things that come out of
the country, including a sense of
radicalism that runs deep through the
UK like a vein of Welsh coal. Who’s
Holding the Baby?, a series of text
collages from the Hackney Flashers
Collective, highlights the poor
childcare provisions for working class
women; looking like a precursor of
a riot grrrl zine, the black and white
text confronts the viewer, in a radical
display against authority.
From this group of radical
feminists we move onto another:
Christine Voge’s pictures of a
Chiswick-based refuge for women.
The first of its kind in the UK, the
centre was soon overwhelmed,
holding up to four times its allocated
capacity. These are the selection
of Jane and Louise Wilson, whose
collaborative collection reinforces
the idea that twins often share an
uncanny mental connection. Their
collection focuses around British
conflicts of the 20th
Century; unlike
the current jingoism on display
centred around the centenary of
WWII, the Wilsons look much
closer to home, focussing on the
Irish Troubles and the Greenham
Common Women’s Camp, which
sprung up in protest to the decision
to place cruise missiles at the RAF
base. A row of photographs of graffiti
make up Conrad Atkinson’s Northern
Ireland 1968 – May Day 1975, under
which a series of quotes centred
around the Northern Irish conflict
are printed on orange, white, and
green paper. By placing them so close
together, Atkinson brings together
the personal and the political,
showing us the people behind the
slogans.
Such British radicalism is also
celebrated in John Akomfrah’s
selection of BFI-funded films,
many of which are experimental in
nature; the majority centre around
home-grown artists, such as Francis
Bacon, Richard Hamilton, and
Barbara Hepworth, whose work was
inherently ground-breaking. While
the majority of the films do seem
interesting, they are just too long.
The 17 total films on display have a
combined running time of over ten
hours; while I do have a lot of time for
video art, quite frankly there’s only so
much one person can take.
The same accusation can be levelled
at Roger Hiorns, whose display
consists of a collection of research he
has done on the Bovine Spongiform
Encephalopathy outbreak and
resulting media hysteria, which
peaked in the mid-90s. The only
fitting word I could think of is
exhaustive; this is not a compliment.
The amount of content that Hiorns
is trying to fit into the three rooms
is enough to make a serial hoarder
embarrassed; along the wall there are
scientific reports in plastic wallets,
entire TV news programmes on the
outbreak, and whole governmental
protocols on controlling the outbreak.
Hiorns would certainly benefit from
another curator, one who could help
him cut down his extensive collection,
and sadly his section marks the lowest
point in the exhibition.
Conceived also as part of the run-up
to this year’s general election, the
Hayward’s show does indeed succeed
in showing that Britishness is defined
by our shared histories. It may not
show us where we are going, but it
certainly shows us where we have
been, and – while some curators could
do with a more confident hand in
limiting their content – is overall a
very compelling exhibition. Britain
is a huge topic to take on, one whose
boundaries are not easily defined, but
the 7 artists on display have by-and-
large managed to show us that history
is, indeed, occurring right now.
History Is Now: 7 Artists Take On
Britain is on at the Hayward Gallery
