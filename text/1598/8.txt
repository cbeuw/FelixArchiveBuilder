Why Weeks is worth saving: a h
Weeks Hall was kindly
donated to Imperial
by British engineering
firm Vickers in 1959 to be used
as affordable undergraduate
accommodation. Ungratefully,
College have now rejected this
generosity and plan to make “more
efficient” (i.e. more profitable) use of
the space.
Weeks is one of the few remaining
halls near campus that are, on
average, cheaper for a single
room when compared to Eastside,
Southside and Beit, but last week,
Union Council voted against the idea
to lobby College to keep it open.
Apparently, turning the building
into academic space or childcare
provision will be cheaper than
renovating the bedrooms, which I
must add, are in perfectly acceptable
condition and are a joy to live
in. Although saying that, a hall
containing the UK’s second ever glass
encased lift and is ten stories high is
obviously the safest and most suitable
place to open a childcare centre...
Regardless, there are endless
reasons why Imperial needs
reasonably priced undergraduate
accommodation on campus and
thousands have benefitted from
living in Garden, Weeks, and
Evelyn Gardens Halls thus far.
College is failing to acknowledge
there are students from low-income
backgrounds who have a right
to study here just as much as the
wealthy.
A gap in the new, proposed rents of
around £95 between those who will be
living in Acton and living on campus
will create a two-class society. Priced
at £170 per week for a standard room,
Weeks Hall would still provide the
middle ground financially and would
allow less wealthy students to enjoy
the benefits of living on campus.
This two-class society will also place
the rich at an academic and social
advantage, since they will be able
to stay in the library until late and
not have to worry about missing the
last tube home, and will have several
hours more per week to join the 300+
clubs and societies which Imperial
proudly boasts.
Neither the Union Council, nor
Tom Wheeler are to blame for this
situation. The manner in which the
Union Council paper about the hall
was worded did not give Weeks the
chance to be saved. Council, made
up of students from many different
communities within college, vote on
various topics during these meetings,
and will not always have a vast
knowledge of everything they vote
on. We feel the paper detailing the
closure of Weeks gave no background
information that they should have
known before deciding on whether
to campaign to keep it open or not,
and this information could have
been sought through involving the
community of Weeks.
The motion to close the halls was
one of several other points within a
long, complex paper, and we feel it
was not paid enough attention as a
topic, and, as a result, we are calling
an emergency council meeting to vote
on the topic again.
Clearly information flow within
the student and staff body has failed
if nobody representing Weeks Hall
was informed of the issue, even
though it was first raised at a Union
Community & Welfare Board
meeting last December.
As a resident in Weeks Hall two
years ago, I lived through the closure
of Garden Hall and recall the outrage
amongst the student community. Yes,
Garden needed a new lick of paint,
but it was clean, functional and had
character.
I remember the first time I saw
Garden’s wooden lounge and feeling
extremely lucky to have access to such
a historical and beautiful building.
Triple rooms cost just £74 a week,
which was truly wonderful, and if it
wasn’t for Garden Hall, many of my
friends would not have been able to
study here.
Upon deciding the time of closure
for Garden Hall, apparently it was
going to be “renovated” into offices
practically immediately. Well, I have
been inside, and almost two years
later, every bed, every wardrobe,
every bedside cabinet is still there.
Homemade “SOS” campaign posters
are still in the windows. Whoever
branded Weeks “an inefficient use
of space”, please do visit Garden Hall
and inspect the millions of pounds
worth of space that you have been
wasting for two years.
Now as a Hall Senior in Weeks,
I have bitterly told my Freshers
the “story” of Garden Hall, while
they sit open-eyed and struggle to
imagine what lays behind the pretty
white façade they walk past every
day. College thinks it can get away
with such outrageous changes to the
accommodation system because in
the future, nobody who remembers
what there once was will be around to
complain.
Next year’s cohort won’t know
what they are missing out on. College
deals with these unfair decisions
based on the knowledge that whoever
campaigns against them will soon be
gone, and whoever will lose out as a
result will be unaware of the previous
alternatives available.
After the closure of Garden,
the warden of Wilkinson Hall
kindly agreed to take on the extra
responsibility of merging Weeks with
Wilkinson, under the assurance that
Weeks would remain open for the
forseeable future.
This was clearly not the case, and
it is now not just the community of
Weeks that will suffer, but also that
of Wilkinson and Gabor. Brunches,
BBQ’s and parties are held jointly
between Wilkinson & Weeks and
Gabor on a regular basis, with the two
(technically three) halls sharing social
spaces. 376 students will be losing
one of the best social spaces Imperial
has to offer, not just the residents of
Weeks.
Katy Sayer discusses why Council need to change their mind about campa
After the initial Against Acton
campaign, College assured us that
rent in Woodward Hall would be
cheap as a compromise to make up for
the fact that students will have to live
at least a forty minute commute away
from campus, in a not so nice area.
At least one year later, with a new
student Council, this compromise
seems to have been forgotten, with
College recently leading the Union
Council to vote on apparently
“reducing” rent in Woodward Hall
to an average of £120 but paid for by
extortionate increases in Eastside and
Southside rents to £200-215.
That College thinks it is acceptable
to force Princes Gardens residents to
subsidise the cost of Woodward Hall
astounds me.
Teenagers are attracted to historic
universities such as Oxford and
Cambridge, and if Imperial wants
to compete with such institutions,
increasing student satisfaction
will involve building up not just a
reputation for academic excellence,
but also one for tradition, both of
which will encourage more donations
towards the College endowment will
result.
Oxbridge heavily subsidise student
accommodation, and in this case
the responsibility of subsiding an
unpopular hall in Acton should be
cast onto the College rather those who
want to live closer to campus.
College and the Union seem to be
obsessed with the figure they have
managed to achieve through number
manipulation of an average rent of
£166 per week. As one of the more
reasonably priced halls, keeping
Weeks open would actually decrease
this average and would reduce the
need to increase Princes Gardens rent
so extortionately.
It is also worth noting that this
