Philippa Skett investigates the fallout
after the revelation that College wants to
shut down Weeks Hall
“Why did no-one
tell us College
wants to shut our
halls?”
Residents of Weeks are
infuriated by the College
decision to close their hall, and
have demanded an emergency Union
Council meeting to revote on the
decision not to campaign against the
closure.
To add insult to injury, those who
live in Weeks only found out about
the potential closure once the paper
had already been voted and decided
upon by Union Council last Tuesday;
no one in the hall had previously been
contacted by either the College or
Imperial College Union.
The residents of the hall first found
out about the proposed closure the
day after the meeting, after reading
Felix’s live tweeting during the Union
Council meeting.
As a result, no-one from Weeks
was present at the meeting, and are
frustrated that they did not have
the opportunity to contribute to
the debate when it was happening.
The hall has already commenced
recruitment for the next year’s hall
seniors, although they are uncertain
if the hall will even be open next
academic year.
Felix tried to find out what the
proposed closure date is for the hall,
but were told that the College has yet
to decide on when they will finally
shut the doors of Weeks to students
for the last time.
College also told Felix that they still
haven’t decided on a use for the hall.
College’s Provost’s Board has the
power to close Weeks Hall, and email
records suggest that the decision has
already been made, although there
are still further decisions to be made.
Felix spoke to Debra Humphris, the
Vice Provost (Education), who sits on
the Provost’s board. The Provost’s
Board is made up entirely of College
staff and currently has no student
representative present.
It took just under an hour to
meet the hundred signature target
needed to call an Emergency
Council Meeting, after the petition
was launched Tuesday night. An
emergency Union Council meeting
can be called into action by any
student, as long as they have the
signatures of one hundred Imperial
College Union members.
Union Council members were
emailed late Thursday evening by
Paul Beaumont, Union Council Chair
to confirm plans for the meeting,
which will take part next month.
The Weeks Hall committee have
yet to submit a formal paper, but
Beaumont stated in the email that it
will most likely address the process
by which Union Council made its
decision, and the lack of consultation
with the residents and the members
effected by the closure.
Weeks residents will also be
meeting with Debra Humphris, the
Pro Rector (Education), Wheeler and
other members of staff who were
behind the decision to close the hall
in the first place.
The Weeks Hall committee have
outlined on their petition that they
are concerned that the decision made
by Union Council was not truly
representative of the opinion of the
student body, and that it was done
“Without sufficient attention given
to the detrimental effect on student
experience.”
They also describe how they are
concerned no representative of the
hall was present at the meeting,
and there is a lack of information
surrounding the closure.
No one at Council was informed
as to when the hall may close and
what changes may be done to the
internal structure for its new purpose.
The new purpose also has yet to be
finalised.
Franca Hoffmann, a subwarden of
Weeks, told Felix: “We have called
[for] an emergency Council meeting
so there is a specific time allocated to
discuss the topic properly, and also to
show that students feel strongly about
the closure of the hall.”
Felix spoke to the Hall committee
ahead of their petition launch, to hear
their thoughts on the closure.
Said one member: “I’m pretty sure
if they had come to us before [the
Council meeting], and told us they
had plans to close Weeks, we would
have launched a petition sooner to
gather support. We would have gone
to the Council if we had known it was
happening.”
One stressed that the hall is a
valuable asset for students, being so
close to campus and also relatively
low in cost compared to Southside,
Eastside and Beit. “It’s only a home
to 66 people, but it is still changing
66 people’s lives and changing their
student experience as they can afford
to live in halls so close to campus.”
Currently, all en suite single rooms
in Eastside and Southside halls are
priced between £186 to £203 a week.
Every room in Weeks is priced at
£157 a week, and all are single-bed.
Another voiced concern over the
lack of communication between
the hall and the Union. “For them
[the Union] to say they thought
college had spoken to us already, its
frustrating. They are the Union, they
represent students, and they should
ask us.
“If you are going to represent
the students, you have to ask the
students, you don’t assume someone
else has.”
Another thought that the onus
lay on College to tell the hall what
was happening, and that this is
not the first instance College have
made decisions without considering
the student’s opinions. “It seems
problematic that the College is
putting the Union Council in this
position.
The College didn’t ask the students
when it came to Garden Halls, and
they are doing it again.”
Added another member: “Imperial
doesn’t do anything against this
image of it being a “money-making”
machine. They can afford not to care
because of its ranking and how its
oversubscribed by applications as
well.”
The paper presented to Union
Council included a number of
motions, with one being the proposal
to campaign against the closure of
Weeks and also Pembridge Hall.
The Union Council voted not to
campaign against the decision, with
18 out of 30 agreeing that the space
should be used for “academic and
non-academic space,” as quoted in the
paper.

They did vote in favour of fighting
the decision to close Pembridge Hall.
Discussions during the meeting
included the potential for Weeks to
be turned into a childcare facility, in a
bid to make Imperial more attractive
to academics with children, both
those that are presently employed
by the College and those who may be
considering applying.
In the Union Council meeting, it
was stated by Wheeler that the hall
was an “inefficient use of space”, with
the rooms being far bigger than those
in Eastside, Southside and Beit, and
also costing less.
Weeks was donated to the College
by the British Engineering firm
Vickers back in the late 1950s, and is
