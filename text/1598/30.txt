Interview: Jon Haynes in Conversation
The afternoon I meet Jon
Haynes on Bond Street, I really
should have better things to
be doing. With a lab report due in
24 hours and a rehearsal to plan
for later in the day, this interview
couldn’t come at a much worse time.
But this opportunity is too good
to miss. With numerous awards
and an enviable reputation as the
pioneers of “seriously funny theatre”,
Ridiculusmus is at the forefront
of British fringe theatre and I’m
chatting to the man behind half
of their creative vision. Gaunt and
serious looking, Jon has something
ominous about him. As their website
tells us, Jon won awards at school
for speaking Greek verse; and after
taking drugs at university and having
a nervous breakdown, Jon founded
Ridiculusmus with his partner David
Woods. Somehow I get the feeling
that Jon is the serious part of their
“seriously funny” dynamic. That said,
he strikes me as a pretty good guy.
Founded during their time at The
Poor School in the 80s, Jon, David
and their partner Angus started out
busking comic songs from the 20s and
30s. Although little came of it, a free
room above a couscous restaurant in
Kentish Town saw the trio open The
Tomato Club. Named after the section
where they would invite comics who
“considered themselves bad enough
to appear”, the audience were armed
with overripe tomatoes and the rest
you can guess. Although the idea
sounds funny, Time Out didn’t agree
saying “the publicity advises “don’t
come”… sounds like advice worth
taking”. But it wasn’t their comedy
that got them kicked out. As Jon
tells me, the restaurant asked them
to leave after tomato seeds started
dropping through the floorboards. I
guess the joke had gone too far, but
to me it almost feels like that’s what
Ridiculusmus’ brand of anti-comedy
is all about.
In much the same fashion, their
first full show bombed spectacularly.
Having by chance been offered to
fill a slot at the Canal Café Theatre
but with no show to put on, the trio
rustled up an adaptation of Three Men
in a Boat, mainly because it had three
men in it – what other reason do
you need?! Well I guess many other
reasons since, as Ian Shuttleworth put
it, “They’ve seriously underestimated
what it takes to whip up some light
frothy entertainment”. Picking
out Jon for some personal praise,
Shuttleworth wrote: “When he leaves
the stage it seems more full”. High
praise for the other two I guess.
The relationship between
performers and critics has always
been a little odd. On one hand,
performers are often reliant on critics
