the meeting instead of just quietly
uploading them to some deep page of
that cyan and magenta maelstrom?
The communication between
College and the Union needs to be
seriously addressed too. I’ve been
bounced between the Union and
College this week when trying to
work out who should have spoken to
Weeks and told them about the plans.
No one had any straightforward
honest answers to offer up, and both
blamed each other. However, I know
for certain my twitter ramblings
certainly shouldn’t have been the
channel through which to deliver the
blow that these halls are being shut
down.
Finally, communication needs
to be addressed when it comes to
College talking to students. And
when I say College, I mean every
member of senior staff that sits in
their boardrooms, discussing these
grand schemes and never thinking
to go into the JCR, the Library Café
or simply pull in a random passer-by
from the walkway and ask them what
they think.
Personally? I get the impression
these people think students are just
naïve kids that pass through the
system in three or four years, and
whatever riles them now won’t matter
once they leave.
How else can you explain how they
happily announce to anyone who
will listen that College is all about
transparency, but then think it won’t
register with us that they’ve also
kept all these secrets from us about
hall closures, sports ground closures,
funding cuts or even Acton?

What’s on this
week:
ICSO Concert
Feb 28th, 19:30, Cadogan Hall
With BBC Young Musician,
Martin James Bartlett
Programme includes
Gershwin’s American in
Paris, Mozart, Borodin and
Stravinsky.
Tickets: £12 to £20, £5 off for
students.
My mother watched Imperial
Question Time (IQL) on
Wednesday, and texted me
after telling me she had enjoyed it.
She did say I looked tense, which was
one of the kinder ways people told me
I looked pretty angry the entire time.
For those of you who didn’t tune
in, IQL was a panel show ran by
ICTV, and featured myself, Tom
Wheeler (Union President), Oliver
Benton (student and Athletic Clubs
Committee chair), Bridge Duncombe
from the Chemistry Department and
Debra Humphris, the Vice Provost
(Education).
We spoke about a number of issues,
such as paying to get into the Union,
just who is the “student voice” and
also the closure of Weeks hall. This
is a topic I have become particularly
pissed off about, as I feel like history
is literally repeating before my
eyes; its yet another example of
crappy communication, and College
disregarding student views.
I was invited to the Weeks Hall
committee meeting on Tuesday
evening, and listened intently to
their worries and concerns over the
closure. They explained how they
had heard that their hall was closing
purely through someone coming
across the Felix twitter stream the day
after the Union Council meeting that
took place. Few of them even knew
what Council was; all were unaware
that the closure of the hall was being
discussed.
A big topic discussed in IQL was
communication, and I said that it
seriously needed to be improved.
The communication between the
sabbatical officers, the Union Council
and students is incredibly poor: more
information about Weeks hall should
have been in the paper announcing its
closure, and it should not have been
embedded in a complex, heavy paper
discussing a lot of other topics.
Students need to be informed what
issues are up for discussion during
these meetings, and make sure those
who may want to contribute to the
debate know they’re welcome. The
Union loves to boast about their
website and hits a day; maybe use
that to advertise papers ahead of
How else do you explain that
they present these “lowered” rent
prices for the halls in Acton, but are
telling us we have to bear the grunt
of increased rent prices as a result
for other halls? I’m pretty sure they
promised us lower rents in the first
place without this catch, but, really,
what do I know?
I’ll probably be gone next year, and
no-one will even remember in five
years what it is like to be able to live
near campus with enough money left
over to pay for entry into the Union.
Finally, how else can you explain
how they talk all about change and
improvement, but they still are yet
to review their piss poor consultation
priorities when it comes to listening
to students?
You can run all the surveys, reviews
and online assessments you like, but
you can never understand the true
views of the students if you don’t take
the time to actually speak to them
one to one.
It shocked me that no-one had
simply gone down to Weeks, sat down
with the students living there, and
simply asked them what they thought
before I did this week. My job is to
report on the news, not do the job
of those in College or those voted to
actually represent students in the
Union.
So I got angry during IQT when
Debra, one of the people behind
the decisions to close the hall, was
throwing these usual lines about
consultation and transparency. I got
angry when all Tom could do was
apologise, but spin it that the College
should have done something when it
came to telling the residents, not him.
Because it was actually myself that
listened as they told me how much
they love their hall, how much value
the property can give to the student
experience, and how again and again
College seem to just announce these
plans without thinking first.
And sadly, I can’t do anything
about it, except make sure as many
people know as possible this time that
College and the Union truly screwed
up.

In last week’s issue, we covered
the Animal Protection and
Education Society debate,
entitled “Animal Testing: Vital
or Necessary?” In the article, we
paraphrased a part of the talk
delivered by Maggie Dallman,
the head of Animal Welfare and
Ethical Review panel of Imperial
College. We heard from those
who were in attendance what they
thought she said, although failed
to double check this was the case.
It has now come to light that
there is some doubt over what
was exactly said, so we apologise
for any upset caused, and have
retracted the paragraph refering
to her portion of the talk, until we
determine exactly what she said
at a later date.
