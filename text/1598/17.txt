Aniston does drama
Ten years is a long time to
play a character and have
that particular role stick to
an actress, and ever since Friends
came off the air, this must be what
plagued Jennifer Aniston’s film
career that happened afterwards.
Her popularity in terms of box office
numbers has never been in question,
but the repetitive roles she took in
underwhelming, uninspired romantic
comedies were getting tiresome. But
here comes Cake, the latest Aniston
film that is getting positive attention
for its lead actress, and for good
reason (those Golden Globe and
Screen Actors Guild nominations for
Aniston speak for themselves).
Whilst not exactly a shocking
transition for the actress, it is nice to
see her shine in a genre we so rarely
see her in; a wonderful reminder that
she will not be remembered solely
for the Rachel role. Aniston is simply
outstanding as Claire Bennett, an
unpleasant, unhappy woman who is
struggling to deal with the various
scars in her life. A violent accident
is hinted at, given the obvious
reminders on her body, whilst the

chronic pain from the trauma she has
to live with does not make life any
easier. Addicted to painkillers and
shutting everyone away from her life,
Claire gets oddly fixated on the story
of a young woman (Anna Kendrick)
from her chronic pain support group,
who committed suicide; so much so
that she even goes to knock on the
widower’s (Sam Worthington) door,
and also finds the time to visit the
actual site of the suicide.
Of all the things the screenplay
could have done with this fascinating
character, the main plotline is
what comes up short. It is a terrible
waste of an excellent, understated
performance, only to place it in an
oddly peculiar narrative that makes
very little sense and does next to
nothing to explain anything. Claire’s
mind is all over the place and this
particular obsession seems to come
out of nowhere and the script is never
committed enough to follow up on
this main part of the story. The weak
link between her and the widower
fails to establish chemistry, and the
film only seems to be back on track
when focusing on Claire’s personal
journey to become a better person.
The redemptive quality in the story
may sound like the ones we have
seen thousands of times before and
in essence there is not a huge lot that
sets this one apart from the rest. But
it is with Aniston’s heart-breaking
turn that the film truly finds its
voice. Claire is someone you are
not sure to feel sorry for. Although
often the grumpy bitch to her loyal
maid Silvana (an equally impressive
supporting turn from Adriana
Barraza), a disruptive influence at the
support group, and someone quite
happily numbing her pain with the
stash of hidden pills not interested
in improving through therapy, there
is an unbearable level of sadness and
yes, pain, with what she has been
through. This is perhaps Aniston
like you have never seen her before.
And for that alone, it is more than
worth the time to sit through Claire’s
frustrating, but ultimately rewarding
journey of coping with tragedy.

SECTION EDITOR
Prepare to do some serious
thinking with this one
because if not, this latest
time-travelling, gender-bending
sci-fi thriller cannot be understood.
Even with focus and concentration
it is difficult to piece everything
together to make one smooth,
singular narrative out of the complex
little strands that mess with your
mind. But there is enormous fun
to be had in The Spierig Brothers’
Predestination, a smart, and often
touching mix of genres that carries
with it some very nice, shocking
twists.
Ethan Hawke is a time-travelling
Temporal Agent who is on his final,
important assignment to take down
a criminal who is set to plant a bomb
that will wipe out many innocents.
His character initially starts off as a
bartender striking up a conversation
with a seemingly random woman who
is feeling chatty about her life. Said
woman is played by Sarah Snook, a
relative newcomer whose role is more
vast than you could possibly imagine
throughout the film. The scenes set
in the bar where the two characters
essentially just talk for a few minutes
may not seem like the most ideal
set-up for what the film promises
later. But it is definitely worth

sticking around for, and listening
to everything that they are saying.
Subtle hints in the background, a
use of certain words and phrases
may give away some clues as to what
Predestination is all about.
To give away any more than this
would be a crime against the film’s
stunning screenplay that throws in
surprises after surprises in the short
running time. There is so much
packed in here and it does tend to
move rather quickly, but with fully
developed characters this poses no
problem to the overall enjoyment of
the film.
Hawke and Snook are excellent
(Snook especially is in an
extraordinary breakout performance
here), and the unexpectedly
emotional element that is added to
the already busy film only shows of
their talent more. There are painful
choices to be made and sacrifices
that need carrying out for the greater
good, and not a single plot strand is
wasted in this tightly organised plot.
Every single detail you see carries
something of importance, and it all
somehow comes together to create a
fluid narrative.
It is always risky for a film or a
television to play with time. There
are issues with continuity that may
arise, things that do not quite add up,
questions about alternate timelines,
and the list of problems goes on and
on. But Predestination tackles this
theme head-on, and does not look
back as it zaps through different
periods to mess with your mind even
more.
Perhaps not everything will make
complete sense after the first viewing;
which is why a repeat screening is
recommended, to fully get your head
around just what the hell happened
with everyone in all the time shifting
spots. The more complex this gets,
the more the film draws you in to its
unique, engaging ride.
