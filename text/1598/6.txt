Researchers from the
Department of Medicine
will perform the first human
trials in nearly half a century into
the medical benefits of psilocybin,
the active compound in magic
mushrooms. The pilot study will
focus on the potential of psilocybin
to help patients with depression
who have failed to respond to
conventional treatments.
Professor David Nutt and Dr Robin
Carhart-Harris of the Centre for
Neuropsychopharmacology have
previously carried out research using
MRI scans to study the brain activity
of 15 healthy volunteers who had
been administered psilocybin.The
new research builds on recent studies
in the US, which have suggested that
people suffering from depression
and anxiety respond positively to
controlled encounters with the
hallucinogen.
The Imperial College scientists were
awarded a Medical Research Council
grant in 2013 to study the effects of
psilocybin on patients suffering with
depression. Due to begin in April,
the experiment will involve studying
the changes in the brains of twelve
patients with depression before and
after receiving a dose of psilocybin.
The scientists then plan to extend
the study to a full clinical trial of 60
patients, 30 of whom will only receive
a placebo.
Research into the potential health
benefits of hallucinogenic drugs
has seen a recent revival after more
than 40 years of stagnation. Despite

"The first
human
trials in
nearly half
a century
into the
medical
benefits of
psilocybin."
Just what is Union Council?
“Bluntly I think it’s something of a
spineless betrayal of our students-
it’s a perfect example of our union
acting as a mouthpiece for college
management rather than a voice
for our members.
“I think it’s also interesting
that council isn’t questioning
the amount college invests in
accommodation or its overall
rental profit,merely discussing
the distribution of rents between
halls.”
“I voted for accepting the closure
of Weeks Hall,not because I hate
Weeks Hall, but because I felt the
reasoning presented at council was
the strongest for that option.
However,I cannot say I made
a very informed decision and
recalling the discussion now I felt
that most of what was said were
things like“...assuming Weeks gets
closed,what can we do with the
space”.
“At the time I think I found the
benefits of using all that potential
area for more suitable causes
appealing,without really settling
the debate about the importance of
Weeks Halls in the accommodation
portfolio.
“I’m glad this is now brought up
properly and I see no reason to why
we shouldn’t listen to what Weeks
residents and other students have
to say,so a visit from them at the
next Council feels suitable.
“If not,I think it is my duty as an
ordinary member of council to hear
these people out between now and
the next meeting in order to make
myself more informed.
“I think that I am not the only
council representative that would
gladlyhaveachataboutWeekswith
the people affected,so I strongly
encourage everyone behind the
petition that’s circulating to contact
someone on council and make their
voices heard.
“That being said,I’m not saying
I would change my vote today,but
good arguments for me doing so
might change my mind.”
“I voted to close Weeks because
it seemed the pragmatic thing to
do given that there is basically no
chance of College changing their
mind.
“However,I do now regret voting
so as I feel we neglected to consult
with the members of Weeks Hall
and consequently we have let down
all of our members.
“I bitterly regret this and feel we
have an obligation to consult better
than we did.
“In many ways,the fact that a
campaign is never going to be
successful isn’t a good reason not
to try.”
“It’s so absolutely embarrassing,
clearly the author of the paper
completely screwed up and so
did we as council members by not
looking into it.
“It’s made even more of a mockery
of Union Council,now people
think rather than not representing
students the Council is actually
going against what students want.”
“I voted against in the first vote and
abstained from the second.I think
the fact is that I can understand
their argument...it’s a lot of real
estate for 67 beds.
My main trepidation is that
college don’t have a good track
history of making good on their
promises.
“Having a bigger nursery for
instance,using some of that space
for club storage etc could all be
good.
“I just don’t know whether what
will actually happen to it is some
sort of campus services outlet or
something equally as unnecessary.”
“Given the information presented
at the meeting,there was a strong
argument to close Weeks.
The space could be put to better
use to support a greater number of
staff and students than it currently
does.
“I believe Council assumed that
the Wardens had already been
consulted,and that putting effort
into lobbying to save other halls
was more beneficial for more
students.
“If there is extra information
that should have been brought to
Council,this should definitely be
considered at the next meeting,
and if in retrospect the view of the
students is very different,Council
would have a mandate to change
its position.”
“I abstained from voting,but
broadly agree with the decision.
If only 70 students per year can
benefit from Weeks’price and
location,that’s not fair on others.
“Also,Council didn’t really have
a choice–all of the important
decisions had already been made
by College.
“We felt it was better for us to
lobby College to not close down
any other halls,to use the Weeks
space in ways most beneficial
to the student body,and,in
the future,to include us in the
decision-making process earlier.”
Union Council is the second
highest decision-making body
at the Union.Council is the main
way that students can directly
influence what happens on a day
to day basis,as it contains the
highest proportion of directly
elected student representatives.
Any member of the Union can
attend a Council meeting,speak
and,with another person to
second them,submit a paper to
be discussed.There are,though,a
number of people who are expected
to attend every Council,as they are
the ones who can actually vote.
There are two ways that these
people are chosen to attend Council.
16 members are directly elected
from the student body in October
to represent undergraduate and
postgraduate students from the
various faculties (e.g.Science,
Engineering and Medicine).
In addition,certain Union
volunteers have a vote and are
required to attend.These council
members are called ex oficio
members,and include Academic
Affairs Officers and the Chairs of
each Management Group.
They are mandated to represent the
views of the academic rep network
and clubs and societies respectively.
The Union President and the four
Deputy Presidents attend each
meeting too,and also sit on the
Trustee Board.
Council papers often serve to
clarify the Union’s official stance
on decisions taken by clubs &
societies,the College and even
the Government.They also
act as a forum to manage the
accountability of Union officers.
What do members think about the Weeks decision?
a wealth of scientific work during
the 1960s investigating the effects of
psychedelic drugs, research had to
be abandoned when LSD was banned
in the UK in 1966.Still a Schedule 1
Class A drug, academics in the UK
require a £3,000 Home Office license
– and approval from NHS research
ethics committees – in order to study
psilocybin.
“The current legislation is stopping
the benefits of these drugs being
explored and for the last 40 years
we have missed really interesting
opportunities to help patients”, said
Professor David Nutt, director of
the Neuropsychopharmacology Unit
in the Division of Brain Sciences.
However the years of waiting and
struggling against red tape may prove
to be worthwhile, if the research
continues to give positive results.
Imperial College scientists to study potential
benefits of psilocybin in patients with depression
"We have

In the last few years studies have
suggested that hallucinogenic drugs
could not only treat patients with
depression but also ease the anxiety
experienced by terminally ill cancer
patients, helping them come to
terms with death, and even aid those
with substance abuse problems in
recovering from their addictions.
