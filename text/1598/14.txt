On the 8th
February, the Royal
Opera House played host
to the 68th
British Academy
Film Awards, or BAFTAs. With all
the glitz and glamour of the Oscars,
but usually set to British rain, this
is one of the biggest awards shows
in the season. It was the tenth
anniversary of Stephen Fry as
host, and he was as delightful and
charming as always, from getting
Birdman nominees Edward Norton
and Michael Keaton to kiss him
(rather than his traditional ‘blow
a kiss to the camera’), to imitating
Stephen Hawking.
Hawking himself got one of the
biggest laughs of the night, after
being announced by Felicity Jones
as “the only man on the planet
more intelligent than Stephen Fry”,
he added “yes, and better looking”.
Paweł Pawlikowski, winner of
the Best Film not in the English
Language expressed his confusion
at the BAFTAs, having previously
won Outstanding Debut by a British
Writer, Director or Producer for
Last Resort in 2001 and Oustanding
British Film for My Summer of Love
in 2005, quipping that “you might
as well give me the fellowship award
now and save time”.
Due to a timing clash with
the Director’s Guild of America
Awards, which had been the
previous night, most of the
directors were absent, including
Wes Anderson, whose film The
Grand Budepest Hotel won five out
of its eleven nominated awards.
When he won the the Best Original
Screenplay award, he got the star of
his film, Ralph Fiennes, to read a
speech he has written in the event.
This speech was very well recieved
by the audience, featuring such
gems as “I was already unhappy to

miss this event but now I’m really
angry and resentful that I’m not
there, and I’m furious,” and a wise-
crack about looking forward to very
eagerly to “getting ahold of this
award physically in my own hands
as quickly as Fed-Ex can possibly
deliver it to me.”
The majority of the awards
went to unsurprising (but still
comprehensively deserving)
winners, from Eddie Redmayne,
Julianne Moore, J.K. Simmons and
Patricia Arquette in the acting
categories to The LEGO Movie’s
claim of Best Animated Film,.
The directing team of Phil Lord
and Chris Miller took the chance to
use their speeech to poke fun at the
Oscars (which snubbed their film in
the Animated category), declaring
the British Academy their “favourite
Academy by far.”
Of course, you can’t have winners
without losers, and tonight was no
exception: the most notable loser
was The Imitation Game, which took
home none of the awards it was
nominated for.
Are this year’s BAFTAs just a
teaser for how the Oscars will play
out? Only one way to find out.
And the winner is: result
