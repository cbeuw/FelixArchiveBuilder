37 THE STUDENT PAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE LONDON FELIX
HANGMAN hangman@imperial.ac.uk
In a televised event that has never
been attempted before, three
students and two members of staff
took part in Imperial Hunger Games,
which was over in under an hour.
The show was commissioned
by “Students Trying to Overcome
Interdepartmental Conflict”, or
STOIC, as an attempt to prove that
as long as different members of
the College community are put
under horrific conditions, they will
eventually learn to communicate,
reason and, eventually, live amicably
together.
However, despite trials ran using
mice proving that they were able to
co-operate under the same conditions,
the run itself involving the human
contestants was a complete failure.
An “arena” was created by STOIC
that was an empty concrete shell of a
room, within which the contestants
were placed, devoid of all technology,
paperwork and Communication
teams that the contestants could hide
behind.
The stage was set for the vaguely
anticipated event with expectations
extremely high that if students made
a request to the staff, they would-for
once- actually take into account the
opinions of the students; however
things only went from bad to worse.
The contestants were then left
to fend entirely for themselves,
whilst placed under increasing
social pressure from “observants”
to communicate and interact. The
observants offered up challenges
for the contestants to complete
satisfactorily, and they were
Imperial Hunger Games takes television world by storm,
shots immediately fired
scrutinised as they attempted to do
so.
There was no food provided and
only water was available for the
subjects.
The contestants included two
members of staff, one of whom has
been branded the Serial Hall Killer.
The three students thrown into the
mix were “I represent the student
body” Wom Theeler, vaguely familiar
Sports Don student, and Skilippa
Phett, the Media Dictator.
However, reaching a state of peace
was seemingly impossible, and
within minutes the contestants were
snarling, arguing and throwing dirty
looks before completely turning on
each other, or being brought down by
the observants.
Theeler collapsed early on. Under
the immense social pressure to
explain why we pay Union entry
fees, he slumped in the corner
whilst trying to search his pockets
for “Excel Spreadsheets,” seemingly
having forgotten all contestants
were stripped of any factual, relevant
knowledge before they entered the
arena.
His final blow was when he was
challenged on why students were not
told about the Weeks closure, which
knocked him out completely, after he
admitted he couldn’t remember when
he was first told about the decision.
The Serial Hall Killer was a stronger
contestant; her first tactic when
challenged about the Weeks closure
was to lull everyone into a comatose
state by using long, sweeping
sentences including numerous
transparent “buzzwords,” including,
ironically, the word “transparent.”
When attacked with a sleak “2-Class
Society division between expensive
and cheap halls” swipe, she started
throwing out lowered rent prices left,
right and centre.
However, those observing were
quick to dismiss such futile tactics
too, throwing increased rent prices
back in her face.
She eventually admitted defeat,
once realising that she had no
definite answers to really solidify any
chance of victory in the arena. She
announced she would need back up,
and bowed out shortly after.
Skilippa’s aggression and “shade
throwing” offense tactic increased
the tension between herself and
other contestants to the point she was
ignored.
She was left throwing controversial
but pointless blows into the arena,
such as “Why bother sending
students to College Council if they
don’t listen to their views?”
Sports Don staved off attacks from
other contestants from being on the
“students are ignored” offence. He
repeatedly struck other contestants
using buzzwords, including
“Teddington,” “AgainstActon,” “No
consultation,” and “Imperial is ran as
a business.”
Sports Don narrowly survived the
Games: should any contestant have
targeted him with a Coach Window
however, the blow almost certainly
would have knocked him out.
The arena was live streamed over
the internet, and people could tweet
ideas to increase and prolong the
social pressure too. It even had
a hashtag, to encourage student
engagement, another myth STOIC
are struggling to prove with other
projects.
The arena was emptied after
just one hour, after all contestants
seemed emotionally exhausted, and,
in the case of Theeler and the Serial
Hall Killer, practically catatonic. It
is thought Theeler was in need of
chemical mood boosting facilitation
shortly afterwards.
STOIC have vowed to attempt
Imperial Hunger Games termly,
and are already in search of the next
recruits to see if social nirvana can be
achieved using other combinations of
contestants. Experts remain sceptical.
The chair of Imperial Questions
Live, Tim Limblebee, remained
positive about the entire event: “We
actually had two people watching
the live stream, and for a couple of
minutes three so that’s definitely
worth the money we spent on this
arena.”
