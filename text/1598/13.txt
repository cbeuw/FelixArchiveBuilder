Joshua Renken chronicles the continuing reinvention of one of
Britain’s best-loved bands
The evolution of Arctic Monkeys
Born and bred in Sheffield,
Arctic Monkeys are an English
rock band that formed in 2002.
Most commonly associated with The
Libertines and The Strokes, Arctic
Monkeys consist of front man Alex
Turner (lead vocals, rhythm guitar,
lead guitar), Jamie Cook (lead guitar,
rhythm guitar), Nick O’Malley (bass,
backing vocals), and Matt Helders
(drums, backing vocals). In the nine
years since their debut album release,
the Arctic Monkeys have released
four more studio albums, won seven
Brit awards, performed during the
London Olympic Opening Ceremony
and headlined Glastonbury. Twice.
As the principal creative force
within the band, Alex Turner brings
to the group his distinctive northern
accent and fiercely intelligent
songwriting. His brilliantly knowing
observations manage to capture a
scene in a remarkably short amount
of time. From the beginning he
displayed emotional maturity beyond
his years and is deservedly hailed by
critics as British indie rock’s finest
lyricist.
Arctic Monkeys burst onto the
music scene in 2006 with their first
LP Whatever People Say I Am, That’s
What I’m Not. This album explored
themes such as relationships, youth
culture, prostitution and nightlife in
a way that felt freshly witty and to
many, beautiful. Alex Turner’s pace
of delivery varies, but many of the
slower tracks sound like the drunken
slurs of a horny poet in the early
hours.
The final track in this album, ‘A
Certain Romance’, still epitomises
what Arctic Monkeys are capable
of. With an immaculate bass riff
during the verses, a climactic trickling
guitar melody and perceptive vocals
throughout, this song describes
and reconciles chav subculture
with astounding eloquence. Rightly
considered to be one of the greatest
indie rock songs of all time, ‘A Certain
Romance’ is as perfect a pop song as
you could ever hope for.
‘Favourite Worst Nightmare’ (2007)
went to No. 1 in the charts and carried
along a similar vein to their debut
album, albeit with more aggression.
The raw beats and rapidly delivered
lines on tracks like ‘Brianstorm’,
‘Balaclava’ and ‘Old Yellow Bricks’
made for an exhilarating sound that
was balanced out by the melancholy,
intimate ballads such as ‘505’ and
‘Only Ones Who Know’.
The band’s third album, Humbug,
is the most hit and miss of the five.
Morose and mysterious in equal
measure, Humbug represented a
significant shift in Arctic Monkeys’
musical direction. With a much
calmer but more challenging sound,
this LP separated the band’s listeners
into fans who loved them all the more
and casual followers who preferred
the unpretentious and grittily
charming tales of love and nightlife
that featured in their first two
albums. Third albums are notoriously
difficult for bands in the limelight
but Turner’s lyrical flair continued
to impress. ‘Humbug’ featured fewer
catchy hooks than many would have
wanted but also included some real
pearls. Tracks such as ‘Cornerstone’
and ‘Dance Little Liar’ reassured fans
that Arctic Monkeys were here to
stay. Four boys had become men.
With Suck It and See (2011), Arctic
Monkeys had returned to making
more accessible and less moody music
than they had with Humbug. However,
many of Turner’s songs were less
interesting than his usual output
and felt hollow by comparison. This
small dip in lyrical form was most
evident in ‘Brick by Brick’, which
is perhaps the weakest track Arctic
Monkeys have ever released despite
the strong instrumentals. ‘Piledriver
Waltz’ takes you on a sublime
journey of soft psychedelic rock with
inventive allegorical lyrics, and ‘Love
is a Laserquest’, ‘Suck It and See’ and
‘That’s Where You’re Wrong’ serve
as a strong trifecta to conclude the
album. This fourth album showed
small changes in the band’s sound,
but in terms of development Suck
It and See is Arctic Monkeys’ least
significant LP of the five.
The band’s most recent creation,
AM (2013), marks the second
metamorphosis of Arctic Monkeys.
This hip-hop influenced album
features an impressive variety of
songs ranging from the thunderous
‘Do I Wanna Know?’ to the gracefully
ironic ballad ‘No. 1 Party Anthem’.
AM represents a return to top form
for the band, where big riffs and
catchy hooks accompany mindfully
crafted, penetrating lyrics. With this
LP Arctic Monkeys have also made
history as the only independent
group whose first five albums have all
gone to the top of the charts.
It would be ridiculous for Arctic
Monkeys to still be writing the kind
of songs that they produced at the
beginning of their career, simply
because the band’s circumstances
have changed so much. They no
longer live the life of a plucky
underground band skulking around
Sheffield. Now it’s all private jets and
courting supermodels in America.
In five short years Alex Turner has
swapped jumpers and long hair
for leather jackets, sunglasses and
a slicked back quiff in a transition
every bit as seamless as the band’s
departure from their previous
albums. Masters of reinvention,
Arctic Monkeys cannot easily be
pigeonholed. They are still maturing
and refining their sound; who knows
what they’ll come up with next. Bring
on album number six.
