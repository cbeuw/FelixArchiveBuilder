Utterly Overpowered By Arthur Miller
Ihave a confession to make. In
my ignorance, I know practically
nothing about Arthur Miller.
Arguably one of the greatest
playwrights of the twentieth century,
at least a superficial understanding
of Miller’s work should probably be
expected from me, but not even that
can I offer. Clueless, but with great
anticipation, it was in this mind-set
that I walked into the Wyndham’s
Theatre for their production of A
View from the Bridge.
One of Miller’s early works, the play
portrays the relationship between
Italian American longshoreman
Eddie Carbone and his orphaned
niece Catherine. Set in 1950s
Brooklyn, two of Carbone’s cousins
arrive illegally from impoverished
Sicily. The strong silent Marco
contrasts the lavish, platinum blond
Rodolpho who, falling in love with
Catherine, unearths a deep seated
jealously and unease in Eddie. A
tragedy in which each character draws
sympathy from the tense audience,
this is unlike anything I have seen
before. With no one individual to
label the villain, an overwhelming
agitation builds throughout the
performance.
Mark Strong’s piercing eyes are
a sight to behold. Imposing and
powerful, Strong’s immaculate focus
and complete dedication to his role
as Eddie is not only completely
convincing but also builds a
beautifully sympathetic character
whose desire for respect and loyalty
hit the audience right at their heart.
Little can be said to describe the
beauty with which this production
has been crafted. Directed by the
Belgian Ivo Van Hove, best known as
the artistic director of Toneelgroep
Amsterdam, the display is simple and
polished. A single doorway is placed
in the centre of the grey background
with the audience surrounding the
action on three sides. The stage is
blank with a continuous glass bench
marking its perimeter. Known for his
avant garde, experimental approach
to theatre, Van Hove has focussed
on the subtleties of each character.
Mr Alfieri, a lawyer who narrates
the story of Carbone is placed as
an integral part of the production.
Played by Michael Gould, Alfieri
observes the action from the back
of the stage, the whites of his eyes
highlighting a deep, unsettling
pressure on the characters.
Particular credit should be given
to Phoebe Fox who, in her role as
Catherine, is both immediately
lovable and remarkably powerful
in confronting Strong. Delicate and
kind, Katy’s influence on Eddie is
heart-warming and makes this play’s
tragic story all the more painful.
The bleak grey costumes and mute
lighting give the play a distinct aged
feeling. With Alfieri’s narration, the
production comes across as a snapshot
from a black and white film with its
distinct air of hindsight going far to
crush the American Dream.
It is odd reviewing such an
overwhelming production. I try to be
somewhat objective, critical and still
embed my opinion into the piece,
but with this, that’s just not so easy.
As much as I want to objectively
analyse the piece, on this occasion,
my emotional response far outweighs
anything else I could say. With
pulsing church music running in the
background and a drum punctuating
moments of heightened tension,
it almost feels like it is Van Hove
deciding when I should breath, when
my heart should beat and when I
should cry. As Alfieri tells us, “I could
see every step coming, step after step,
like a dark figure walking down a hall
towards a certain door.”
So could the audience, but we
were powerless. Like a well-planned
ceremony, this production ripped up
a man’s pride while we watched it rain
blood from above.
A View from the Bridge is on at
Wyndham’s Theatre until April 11th
