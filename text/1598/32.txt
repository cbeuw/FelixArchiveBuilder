Sargent – A Bridge To The Modern
John Singer Sargent is not often
included amongst the great
painters of the late 19th
century.
It’s an exclusive club. Monet, Renoir,
Picasso, Degas, Rodin, Cézanne, van
Gogh, and Klimt amongst others
dominate the public perceptions
of art in the 1880s-1910s, and with
good reason. Some of the biggest
movements in art history took
place in that period; it was the
birth of modern art in the form of
impressionism, the beginnings of
cubism. At the turn of the century
the age of the avant garde had started
sweeping through Europe, leaving
Sargent looking somewhat stuck in
the archaic realism of yesteryear.
He and his paintings were regarded
by many of his contemporaries as
accomplished but lightweight –
pandering to his rich patrons rather
than contributing to the innovative
canon of European art of the era.
Modern critics have often taken
the same view; Sargent has gained
a reputation for painting portraits
that depict the moneyed literati and
society heiresses of Paris and London.
A virtuoso but with an oeuvre that is
staid and facile.
Sargent: Portraits of Artists and
Friends at the National Portrait
Gallery tries to dispel this. It mostly
succeeds. The subjects themselves are
what we would expect from Sargent;
the paintings number his artsy
bohemian friends, a distilled ‘who’s
who’ of European society of the age.
Amongst Sargent’s sitters are Henry
James, Treasure Island’s Robert Louis
Stevenson, Auguste Rodin, Claude
Monet, and WB Yeats, considered by
some the greatest English poet of his
generation. Each painting is charged
with expression and character, and
each figure has arresting eyes that
pierce the viewer, anchoring them to
the moment depicted.
Andy Warhol said of Sargent “[he]
made everybody look glamorous.
Taller. Thinner.” Indeed, within the
nearly 70 portraits exhibited, there is
no unsightly mole or wrinkle in sight.
Sargent seems to conjure the sitters
from pure light, illuminating their
face and drawing them out of their
shadowy backgrounds with the skill
of a sculptor. The paint suggests at,
rather than delineates, the contours
and planes of his subjects. Sometimes
hands disappear altogether in
an insouciant flourish into folds
of clothes, the colours whirling
and smudging into one another.
He sometimes leaves parts of the
canvas unpainted, as in his portrait
of Vernon Lee, which captures the
"Each
figure has
arresting
eyes that
pierce the
viewer."
"His
emphasis
was placed
capturing
light
on the
subjects."
