Find 72 colours hidden in the grid horizontally, vertically or diagonally. All
the words to be found of six letters or less are listed below, but it's up to you to
discover the longer ones.
No colour is nested inside another: for example, if you find POWDER BLUE,
which contains RED spelled backwards, then RED must be found somewhere else
in the grid.
When all the words have been found, the 17 remaining letters, taken in order,
will spell out the names of two dyes.
