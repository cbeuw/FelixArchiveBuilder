What does
College say about
all of this?
Debra Humphris,Vice Provost
(Education) sits on the Provost’s
board,the body that has the power
to shut the halls.
When Felix spoke to Humphris,
she was unable to comment on the
specifics regarding when the hall
will close,or what the proposed
changes to the internal structure of
the building may be.
Humphris told us that College
is in a process of renovating the
whole Imperial estate,including
the new campus based at Imperial
West.College have plans that will
come into effect over the next
ten to twenty years,but are still
assessing what should be rebuilt or
what should be refurbished.
Said Humphris:“We need to
evolve our portfolio,and change
is necessary to do this.However,
there are a lot of tough decisions to
make.”
She referred back to the Student
Residential Experience Review,ran
back in 2013 that looked to gauge
the opinion of student halls.
“We want to increase
transparency.One example is the
the rent proposals that were agreed
on with students at Union Council,
which we’ll now be implementing.
We know we need to average
rent out at Woodward to £120 for
example,and we are now making
sure the figures work for the
various room types to ensure this
remains the case.
“I don’t know of another
university that is as transparent
with their consultations with
students over their plans,in the
way we have worked with students
on rental arrangements but there
are some decisions where we can’t
consult broadly in the way we’d
like.”
Debra explained how many
London university student halls
are moving further afield as
accommodation within the city is
increasing in price.“The London
student housing issue is a cause
for concern.We should be working
with other universities to lobby
Boris Johnson over this.
Some students are now expected
to live around thirty to forty
minutes from their campus,so
it is not easy.Accommodation in
London is a struggle; it’s a struggle
for students and for staff too.”
She also explained that
decisions around Evelyn Gardens
are dependent on its owner,the
Wellcome Trust.It will close after
this academic year.“It’s down to the
Wellcome Trust [who own the halls]
on what they want to do with them,
and currently we don’t know what
they want to do with the buildings.”
Humphris said that in the event
excess accommodation was
retained there could be wider
student use:“We know there are
more students who would want to
live with us if we could give them
the chance.”
Debra also said there were no
definite plans for Garden Halls
yet,although stressed that there
were areas of the hall that weren’t
even safe to live in.“It needs to be
considered alongside the whole
North side of Princes Garden,as
part of College masterplanning.
And the masterplanning is driven
by the fact that we are desperate for
more academic space.”
She concluded:“We need to look
at the entire estate as we grow and
evolve,and as part of that we need
to make difficult decisions.”
considered a Grade II listed building
due to the glass-encased lift that runs
through the centre of the hall.
The minutes of the Community and
Welfare Board shows that Wheeler
was made aware of the planned
closure of Weeks as early as October
of last year, but, during the Imperial
Question Time discussion on
Wednesday, he said that he couldn’t
remember the exact time it was
brought to his attention.
Humphris was also present at
Imperial Question Time, and
members of the halls committee who
were in the studio audience asked her
about the decision to close Weeks.
She admitted that College could be
at fault over the lack of consultation
before the decision was made. “We
need to get this right, we have a
consultation framework, we had a
big decision to make – to be fair, we
were talking to Tom [Wheeler] and
Joe Cooper [Managing Director of the
Union] but clearly we’ve not got it
right, so we need to work at getting it
better.”
In an email sent to members of the
Weeks Hall Committee, Tom sent his
heartfelt apologies and stated that
they were “under the illusion that
College had spoken to its residents
and employees about the closure.”
However, members of the hall
committee remained unimpressed
by his response. Said one member:
“If you vote for someone to represent
you, you want them to do a good job
of it.”
When Felix asked the Union why
they ran a paper to campaign against
a decision that they could not change,
a spokesperson responded: “In recent
weeks it became apparent that the
decision to close Weeks Hall had
been made with no possibility for a
reversal of this decision.
“Union Council had the option
of whether to campaign or not on
this decision, we reject the notion
that campaigning against the
closure would have been “pointless”.
Campaigning is not always about
delivering change, but sparking
debate, discussion and raising
awareness of an issue.” Photo: Imperial College
