intelligence and brilliance of the art
historian, woman of letters (Vernon
Lee was the pen name of Violet Paget)
and feminist, all with the greatest
economy of brushstrokes.
The influence of Sargent’s training
with the celebrated French society
painter Charles Auguste Émile
Carolus-Duran is apparent. Carolus-
Duran’s method of teaching was
at the time radical; an admirer of
Velázquez, he insisted that his pupils
draw and paint at the same time with
a loaded brush on unprepared canvas.
His emphasis was placed on capturing
light on the subjects, expressing the
object through fluid painting rather
than seeking to create a solid mass or
a precise tonal structure.
Sargent employs this technique
with mastery in one his best earlier
portraits: a commanding likeness
of Carolus-Duran, which bears the
touching inscription “to my dear
master... [from] his affectionate
pupil”. Much of Carolus-Duran’s
style is evident in Sargent’s work;
both men’s portraits depict the
sitter glancing out from the canvas
from dark, sparsely painted of
backgrounds. They paint in the vein
of Velaquez, the Spanish master by
whom Carolus-Duran was inspired.
Velaquez’s mid-17th
century Portrait of
Juan de Pareja in particular bears great
resemblances to the style that Sargent
favoured for much of his career. One
of his fellow students remarked in
1847 “Mr Sargent is about 18 years
old and one of the most talented
fellows I have ever come across; his
drawings are like old masters, and his
colours are equally fine”. And Rodin
commented that Sargent was “the
Van Dyck of our times” after seeing
the painting The Misses Hunter.
Sargent straddles the line between
realism and impressionism, never
quite committing to either. However
his work is never simply reiterating
the old, and his paintings are
profoundly modern.
His double portrait of the Pailleron
children is nothing like what children
were depicted as in the 19th
century.
They stare out from the canvas,
lit spookily, half in shadow, their
expressions sombre and knowing,
and their complexions deathly
pale against the rich velvet of the
background. This haunting portrayal
with its psychological intensity is
thought to have inspired Henry
James’ gothic horror story Turn of the
Screw. Similarly, oversized lilies hang
over the girls in Carnation, Lily, Lily,
Rose, bringing a hint of danger into
the serene picture of two young girls
lighting lanterns in the twilight.
Sargent’s paintings of Robert
Louis Stevenson show him at his
most experimental; in Robert Louis
Stevenson and His Wife, his usual
way of focusing on the sitter’s face is
abandoned for a staging that seems
incidental, almost photographic. The
writer is shown looming, mantis-like,
thin as rake, and walking towards
one end of the canvas; on the other
"His work
is never
simply
reiterating
the old,
and his
paintings
are
profoundly
modern."
"Sargent
made
everybody
look
glamorous.
Taller.
Thinner."

end his wife folds herself into a chair,
hiding her face with a shimmering
golden veil. The space between the
figures is charged with tension, and
an open door takes centre frame
implying unknown secrets and
limitless possibilities.
Even in his more conventional
paintings, theatricality is ubiquitous.
The sitters become larger-than-life
versions of their characters. Warhol
may have thought Sargent to be
glamourizing his sitters, but he was
sometimes far from flattering,
remarking that he lost a friend every
time he painted a portrait of one. It
is not to be forgotten either that he
painted Portrait of Madame X, the
now notorious painting of Virginie
Gautreau in a plunging black dress
which so scandalised French Society
that the sitter was from then on
entrenched in gossip, and Sargent
was forced to leave Paris.
The National Portrait Gallery
exhibition seeks to show Sargent at
his least conventional; these painting
are after all, un-commissioned, and
Sargent presented many of them to
his friends as gifts. The collection
does show him at his most fluid,
but also paints him as the perennial
watcher – forever on the outside
looking in. Nowhere is this more
highlighted than in his portraits
of Monet. He depicts the great
impressionist painting en plein air
and sur le motif, some of the only
evidence we have that Monet did so.
Sargent admired Monet immensely,
collecting many of Monet’s works
and later switching to his style of
painting out in the open. In these
painting we see almost a desire to
imitate Monet’s characteristic use of
colour and brushstrokes; the grass
is painted in the hues that Monet is
known for, and this marks Sargent’s
desire to move into impressionism,
a transition which he never quite
mastered despite his best efforts.
Monet was said to be quite irritated
by Sargent’s frequent desire to learn
from him, and he wrote to his wife
complaining that Sargent “is making
an extraordinary inquiry about the
use of yellow and green and asking me
if I am coming to London; he needs
me to advise him on the pictures he is
working on”.
Sargent was in many respects the
end in the line of the old masters;
in the vein of Velaquez and Ingres,
he was one of the last great society
painters. His paintings did not test
the boundaries of art as many his
contemporaries did, but his work is
no less for it; by sticking staunchly to
realism whilst modernism directed
his contemporaries, Sargent created a
dialogue between classic and modern,
bringing together in his work Van
Dyck, Velazquez, Monet, and Degas
using visual quotations, thereby
reinventing realism for the 20th
century.
His painting show a great
humanism and empathy for his
subjects, and it is his affection for
them that shines through to confer to
them an ageless glamour. Whatever
his shortcomings, this exhibition
shows Sargent at his best.
Sargent: Portraits of Artists and Friends
is runnning at the National Portrait
Gallery until 25th
May. Tickets £14.50;
