to reach the next level with their art
and many are successful as a result.
But, as Jon puts it, “you get a 1 star
in the Guardian, your show is done
for”. So you wouldn’t have blamed
the trio for giving up there, but they
remained adequately stubborn.
With a suggestion to perform The
3rd
Policeman from an audience
member, an absurd, surrealist play
almost perfectly suited to the trio,
Ridiculusmus as a serious company
was born. With an extensive tour and
the support of a few more enlightened
critics, the company set up as a
resident company in Derry, Northern
Ireland.
With a small amount of funding
and an urge to relieve some
boredom, the trio began working
on more experimental methods for
devising original work and came up
with The Exhibitionists. Although
reasonably successful, the show left
them unsatisfied. In an attempt to
perform an Indian epic, audiences
started walking out, and with Jon’s
personal life starting to collapse, the
company seemed at risk. Having
been briefly sectioned during his
time at university in Sheffield, Jon
felt alienated in Northern Ireland.
Angus left the trio to move into
filmmaking, and after a painful stint
living in an industrial unit in Belfast,
the duo decided to risk everything on
two shows at the Edinburgh fringe
in 1999. Although the book Jon
sends me after the interview paints a
rather bleak picture of their time in
Northern Ireland, Jon tells me that it
was there that Ridiculusmus finally
discovered their artistic vision.
“Seriously funny theatre” was born.
The Exhibitionists & YesYesYes
opened to rave reviews with
YesYesYes garnering a number of top
awards including Time Out ‘Best Off
West End production’ in 2000 and
Total Theatre’s award for ‘Best British
Production’. With a smattering of
fresh publicity and an extensive tour
across the UK and abroad, YesYesYes
gave Ridiculusmus their first chance
at real funding and linked them with
a number of big players.
Over the last 15 years, Ridiculusmus
have continued the artistic vision that
gave them their first break. Focussing
on a number of two-handers, Jon tells
me a little about the creative process
behind the majority of his work;
"When
starting out
on a project,
the team
usually have
few ideas set
in stone"
starting out on a project, the team
usually have very few ideas set in
stone. With little more than an idea
about the number characters, a week
is spent improvising, sometimes with
a number of collaborators, sometimes
just the two of them. Recording all
the material, Jon tells me that they
“transcribe everything, no matter
how banal and shit, word for word,
um for um”. A little odd, but Jon
swears to me it works. “Philip Roth
used to spend a year writing 8 hours
a day – total shit”. The main talent of
the writer was putting up with your
own shit – “God this is terrible!” But
after a year – or in Ridiculusmus’
case, a week – they’d come back and
try to pick out anything that had a
little life. Jon tells me they’re looking
for conflict or drama; I’m pretty sure
they’ve found it.
With the few sparks of life picked
out and a core idea to work on, Jon
and David can spend months to
years researching their ideas. With
no director, touring becomes an
intrinsic part of the creation process:
“Working the show out as we perform
to an audience, in a way the audience
become our director”. The audience’s
immediate response lets the duo work
out line for line what’s funny and
what’s not.
When they started out on The
Eradication of Schizophrenia in Western
Lapland, the duo had only settled on
two things; they wanted to work with
collaborators and they wanted to
base something on a family. With a
week dedicated to development work
at the National Theatre Studios,
it became clear that mental health
was a recurring theme in their
improvisations. David’s father had
exhibited psychosis while he was
growing up before his brother also
discovered that he had “the gene that
makes you flip”.
“I think that’s where madness starts,
amongst the pieces and the teacups”,
Jon notes while talking about the
focus on the family. While he tells me
his time in a psychiatric ward didn’t
particularly influence the production,
he recalls that there was a man on his
ward who would tell rambling tales
about how the novelist John Fowles
having stolen his wife; Jon didn’t
believe any of it, but years later what
he had thought of as delusions turned
out to be all true. Were his character’s
delusions in Eradication all meant
to be true? Of course not, but the
implication is rather amusing.
Two years and one script later,
the show began touring, and as you
can imagine with such a touchy
subject, responses to the depiction
of psychosis were mixed. “A
schizophrenic was not happy with
me saying, “It’s not like that, it’s not
like that. You need to be a lot more
worked up.”” Others argued that
delusions were very personal, internal
things; if you’ve been through
psychosis, it is understandable not
wanting to be represented on stage.
But in their challenging position
as theatre makers, Jon insists that
"The fiscal
sadism
of the
government
means there
just isn’t
enough
money"
Ridiculusmus’ ultimate goal is to
entertain. Even if the subject matter
is bleak, you want to make people
laugh.
Set up so that the two performances
were running simultaneously, Jon
describes the challenges of such a
complex play. “The problem is trying
to act this very weird script where
you’re trying to be in the moment
on one side but need to fully pay
attention to the other side…you can
never really get lost in the piece in
the typical method acting way”. As
Jon points out: “there’s no rule about
what mental illness should be”, and
certainly not in how it should be
depicted.
And from that springboard, Jon
tells me about Ridiculusmus’ next
project. With Eradication having
been the first part, the duo are now
focussing on the second instalment
in a trilogy on alternative discussion-
based therapies for mental health.
With trials running in South
Carolina, the treatment of therapy-
resistant PTSD in war veterans is
the theme for their next instalment.
Premiering at the Melbourne Festival
in autumn, the performance will see
Jon playing a veteran living in a box
in his kitchen with David out the back
door trying to convince Jon to have
the MDMA treatment.
But even with the best intentioned
plans, an ominous thought hangs
over our discussion. Jon tells me
that they’ve recently been rejected
for funding from the Arts Council.
Although Jon insists the Arts Council
value Ridiculusmus, apparently they
are better suited to a project based
funding model: “The fiscal sadism of
this Government’s slashing means
there just isn’t that much money to
go around”. Having lost their spot
at the Barbican’s Pit Theatre due
to funding, and with no manner
in which to sustain the company
without external support, Jon fears
they might have to close. “If we don’t
get [the project funding], I don’t know
what we’re going to do... It’s a fragile
existence”. Without the funding to
carry out their research, who knows
whether they will be around at all
in a couple of years. I certainly hope
they are. Their work may not be
conventional, but Ridiculusmus’
creative vision is unique, and we
cannot underestimate how important
that is for the arts today.
Towards the end of our discussion,
Jon tells me about an article written
recently by David Edgar. Entitled
Death of the Playwright, the article
argues that the devised theatre
is pushing out the old idea of the
playwright. But that’s not the point.
Theatre is a collaborative art and all
that matters is the end product, what
is shown on stage and what people
will remember. While Edgar might
be right that devised work often is
poorly thought out, Ridiculusmus’
complete devotion to their art and
incredible focus in creating work is
too valuable to the British theatre
scene to just lose overnight.
