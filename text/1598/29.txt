When it was first performed
in 1853, the Venetian
opera house La Fenice
insisted that Verdi’s La Traviata
be staged in the past, around 1700,
despite his original intention of
a contemporary staging. Perhaps
the initial resistance was due to the
opera’s controversial nature painting
the main character of a prostitute
as a human and a victim, but it was
not until the 1880s that Verdi’s
intentions were realized. In this
modern production with the English
National Opera however, director
Peter Konwitschny is acutely aware
of the timeless appeal and relevance
of love, death, and the hypocrisy
of society. What struck me was the
minimalism of the production, with
basic, monochromatic costumes and
hardly any set – a story that could
have happened anywhere, in any
period of time.
Verdi’s multi-faceted social
commentary sees Violetta, a high-
class prostitute, falling for the
bookish admirer Alfredo, who moves
her with his devotion and sincere
belief in living true to oneself. She
follows him to the countryside, where
Alfredo’s father Germont eventually
finds her and, in order to preserve
his family’s honour, convinces
her to leave his son. Livid at this
perceived betrayal, Alfredo publicly
denounces Violetta in one of the most
gripping scenes of the opera, where
the socialites rush back on stage
after leaving for dinner to hear his
vicious words. With napkins tucked
into their fancy clothes and wielding
cutlery like weapons, the party-goers
are bent over with anticipation, eyes
hungry for drama and Violetta’s
imminent downfall. This is the same
bunch that attended her party in the
first scene, supposedly celebrating
her recovery with her. The hypocrisy
is shocking, yet uncomfortably
reminiscent of real life.
First performed in 2013,
Konwitschny’s La Traviata is on
a revival with most of the cast
returning except the role of Violetta;
Elizabeth Zharoff is new to the role,
yet she captivates from start to end
with her delicate yet unyielding
delivery. Her singing mirrors her
transformation from a confident
courtesan to a passionate lover to a
victim of social hypocrisy resigned to
her tragic fate. Ben Johnson’s Alfredo
was convincing as a socially awkward
bookworm, and although his singing
began weakly, he did pick up from his
earnest imploring of Violetta to get
her to renounce her socialite lifestyle
for a life of “real emotions”.
Konwitschny feels that Violetta
is the only human character in the
show – even Alfredo, whose sincerity
is stirring at the start, turns around
to destroy what he fought so hard
to achieve. Indeed, the chorus was
key to bringing out the main themes
of the opera, from their polite but
insincere celebration at the start, to
their hunting down of Violetta at
the end, as well as their presence on
stage while she sings of her fate in the
darkness. It is her solitary, doomed
fight against the duplicity of society
that moves us, and which makes her
death seem like a final salvation.
Plot progression makes effective
use of the very basic set: a sole wooden
chair and several red curtains, from
which Alfredo enters Violetta’s life
and through which Germont comes
to disrupt their down-to-earth
existence in the countryside. As
Alfredo’s ideals of love and passion
take hold in Violetta, the two slowly
draw the curtains to the sides,
mirroring her revelation. When they
meet again in the last scene, in which
Alfredo repents but Violetta is too far
gone in her illness, the two sing while
pushing back imaginary curtains,
clinging on to an illusion of what they
have lost.
Despite, or perhaps because of,
the minimalism, staging is varied
and interesting – from the fluid
movements of the chorus, to the last
scene where Violetta is the only one
left on stage, the placements carried
the themes very well. A strange
addition that was not in Verdi’s
original piece was the actual character
of Germont’s daughter on stage,
invoked to guilt-trip Violetta into
giving up Alfredo, whose affair with
a prostitute has ruined his sister’s
chances of a respectable marriage.
Awkward and equally bookish, the
girl was out of place and seemed to
me almost a hindrance to the whole
scene.
La Traviata was also the first opera
I have seen sung in English, which
took some adjusting to at the start
when characters sung passionately
in English libretto. Perhaps it is the
romanticism of foreign languages,
but at some points the vernacular
English phrases were somewhat
comical when sung in earnest
vibratos. Nevertheless, it was a good
translation and it was nice to be
able to understand without my eyes
having to dart from subtitles to stage.
With the intertwining of a
tragic love story with slick social
commentary, carried by the voices of
the impressive cast, Konwitschny’s
production pruned the opera to
its essence, and the result is sharp,
relevant and clever.
La Traviata is on at the London
Coliseum until March 13th
. Tickets from
£12
