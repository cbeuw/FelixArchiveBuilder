Last Wednesday saw the very
first broadcast of Imperial
Questions Live, a new current
affairs debating programme asking
the big questions on campus.
The show, broadcast from the
brand new Media Centre in the West
Basement of Beit Quad, was presented
by fourth year EEE student, Thomas
Lim. The panel consisted of; Tom
Wheeler, ICU President; Debra
Humphris, Vice-Provost Education;
Oli Benton, ACC Chair; Bridge
Duncombe, Chemistry DUG; and
Philippa Skett, Felix Editor.
Questions were asked by the live
studio audience, who were able to
submit questions online in advance.
A broad range of questions were
asked, ranging from the Weeks Hall
closure to the legacy of sabbatical
officers. Audience members consisted
of interested people, including many
residents of Weeks Hall.
Over the course of the hour long
programme, viewers could watch live
on the Imperial College Television
(ICTV) website and YouTube, as well
as joining in the debate on Twitter
using the hashtag #iql. One person
who watched the show live, RCSU
President Serena Yuen, told Felix
“I really enjoyed watching IQL
last night – I thought it was really
well executed and there was a wide
variety of questions leading to good
discussion on some relevant topics.”
The director of the show was Pete
Brook, who told Felix “It’s really
exciting to have put on our first live
show since the redevelopment of the
Imperial Questions Live looks
into the tough subjects
Philip Kent reports on ICTV’s exciting new show
west basement. It is a culmination
of months of hard work by ICTV
members to make the studio firstly
habitable and then functional. I’m
exceptionally proud of everyones
hard graft.”
One of the main themes from the
debate was over the way the College
communicates with students.
Notice was given to the Union’s
consultation framework, while Debra
Humpries made note of wishing to be
more transparent with students.
One of the more contentious
points aside from Weeks Hall was
the Union’s entry fees. Tom Wheeler
described how the revenue from entry
fees (around £25,000) gets reinvested
in Union services, although others
questioned why the Union’s bars
doesn’t appear attractive to students.
Phihippa Skett, who sat on the
panel, told Felix, “Being on the
panel was a lot of fun, and i really
enjoyed the experience. I think it is
vital that we can directly ask senior
members of the Union and College
questions about the issues that are
affecting students, as I feel that often
these people sit in their offices and
forget what it is like talking to actual
students once in a while.”
ICTV’s next broadcast will be
the annual production of Meet the
Candidates, where viewers can watch
candidates for next year’s sabbatical
officers debate with each other. This
will be broadcast live in two weeks.

How did IQL happen?
The workload of Imperial students is unashamedly
high–are we able to do all the things we want whilst
continuing with our degrees? Probably not.Nonetheless,
I feel there is a significant deficit in the way the College
and Union interacts with students,and makes them
aware of the issues they care about.Students don’t have
the time or patience to attend Union Council or other
meetings which may be of interest,perceiving them
as boring,drawn out and allowing a few people to talk
aimlessly for a long time (something I hope the Union’s
Democracy Review will work on).
Despite the reputation of apathy at Imperial,I remain
convinced that if people are given information in the
right format,they are fundamentally still interested in
the decisions and topics which affect their (and future
cohorts’) lives as students.A Question Time format is
one viewers are accustomed to,and importantly,allows
for a two way exchange and debate.Key to this,the
audience ask the questions and follow up with panellists
should they be unhappy with the answers they hear.
Perhaps it was the act of getting our panellists out of
their comfort zone and in to a studio with lights trained
on them,or the audience of‘non hack’students which
changed the dynamic.Judging by the messages received
afterwards,we achieved some margin of our goal (or
my friends are just really kind to me).Even being a
Trustee and having worked with Tom Wheeler (Union
President),I felt I understood the pressures he faces
better following the show.
I for one,am immensely proud that we managed to
produce the show,of the panelists for taking part,the
audience & viewers for giving us so many questions
and the ICTV tech team for producing a high quality
broadcast,despite technical hitches.I hope this will
become a termly event now: the only way is up for
Imperial Questions Live!

A taster of
what was
discussed
Closure of Weeks
Weeks found out about the
closure of the Hall from Felix’s
Twitter feed after the Council
meeting.
Tom Wheeler can not recall
when he first became aware of
the closure of Weeks although
minutes suggest he knew about
the closure last December.
Not fighting the closure is
being pragmatic,it recognises
the wide ranging changes
happen to College’s portfolio of
campuses and accommodation.
Tom and Wheeler say there is
no chance of a campaign to save
Weeks.
Bridge says We need to trust
students and build better
communication.
What does College do to supoort
teaching?
Changed the promotion
criteria-can not be prompted
purely on research,and can not
excuse poor teaching.
20th
Anniversy of President’s
award,things like supervision–
all need student nomination
Why does the Union charge an
entry fee?
“Because it is budgeted for and
if to remove that there will be
less money going on everything
else we spend it on.”
ACC Bar nights,almost filling
the Union to capacity-make only
£150.A venue in Fulham can offer
cheaper drinks and make money.
“Why can’t the Union run a
model that incites our own
students into the bars to use and
creates a market.Suggest you
need to review your model fully.”
