Recovering, One Day at a Time
Diba Esbati shares some of her day-to-day coping strategies
Taking things one step at a time can be the difference between having a not so crappy day and a complete mental breakdown, so slow down and take

Depression sucks, there’s no
getting around that. It’s awful
and makes you feel like you’re
not in control of your own emotions,
sleep pattern, or motivation. But
something that’s worth remembering
is that it’s not unmanageable.
In my years of dealing with
depression and anxiety, there have
been a few things I’ve picked up
that have helped me cope a little bit
better with day to day events, and I’m
sharing them with you in the hopes
that it might help make recovery just
that little bit easier for you.
Get Out of Your Head
The most important step I have found
(besides getting professional help
of course!) is to learn to recognise
obsessive thoughts and stop them
before they can go too far. Something
that depression, anxiety, and
countless other mental illnesses do
to us is that when we find something
that makes us upset, it makes us dwell
on it.
It’s not a conscious decision to
sink deep into thought and try to
overanalyse everything, and it’s not
your fault, it’s just what they do to
your brain, and the key is to learn to
catch these obsessive thoughts just as
they come in and stop them pulling
you down into a spiral of obsessive
thoughts and sadness.
Distract yourself! Watch your
favourite TV show. Call up a friend.
Go out for a walk. Drag yourself out
of the house, no matter how much
you want to just lie on your bedroom
floor and cry, I promise you’ll feel
better after you get out of the house
and more importantly, out of your
own head.
Set Small Goals
Set tiny little goals for each day,
just something that will get you out
of bed in the morning. When I was
first put on medication, and every
time the dosage is altered or there
are other radical changes to my
prescription, I take a massive hit to
my motivation. Setting goals makes
sure that I actually get up and stop
thinking about why I’m miserable
all the time.It can be something as
little as washing the dishes, or reading
a chapter of that book you’ve been
dying to read.
When you’re depressed, it’s so
difficult to motivate yourself to do
things, because everything seems
like a challenge, even small things,
so every little win counts. A word of
caution though, don’t be too harsh
on yourself if you’re feeling too bad
to complete something on your task
list. It doesn’t mean you’re a failure, it
just means you’re having an off day,
just try your hardest to stick to it the
next day.
Don’t be alone
I’m not saying be with people 100%
of the time, we all need alone-time.
But don’t isolate yourself from the
world. I can’t talk for everyone, but I
know for me, it gets worse when I try
and just lock myself in my room all
day alone with my thoughts. Try and
organise activities during the week
that get you to hang out with other
people.
Find Happy Little Things
Do something that makes you happy
everyday. For me, this ended up being
doodling and painting, but it can be
anything, knitting, writing, playing
video games, reading, anything.
Depression makes you forget what
you used to enjoy before it struck,
so maybe take some time and try
to rediscover things that used to
make you happy. I know it can be
frustrating to be unable to get joy
from many things, but it’s worth
giving it a try, especially if you can
remember why you liked doing what
it was you did that made you relaxed
and happy.
New Hobbies are Great
Discover new hobbies and activities.
Learning to do something new, even
if it’s something inconsequential like
learning to knit, scrapbook, or draw
can be super motivating. It makes
you feel accomplished, which in turn
makes you feel a little less annoyed
and angry with yourself.
These are just little things that have
helped me on my road to recovery,
and not all of them will be easy
changes to make, but it’s definitely
worth giving them a try. And
remember, don’t suffer in silence.
Talk to someone if you’re struggling
and think you might need a little help
to get through, there is no shame in
asking for help!
"Get out of
the house
and out of
your own
head."
"Rediscover
things that
used to
make you
happy."
If you are concerned about
your own mental health,or
that of a loved one,there are
people out there you can talk
to who can give you advice,or
will be there to listen.
