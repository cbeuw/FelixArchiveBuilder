The discovery of three new
fossilised monkey specimens
in the heart of Amazonian
Peru could shed light on the origins
and early evolution of primates in
South America; one of the most
controversial issues in primate
palaeontology.
Primatologists have long
hypothesised that New World
monkeys travelled across the
Atlantic Ocean from Africa after the
continents were separated by plate
tectonics 65 million years ago.
It is not uncommon for unfamiliar
animal and plant groups to appear
abruptly in the fossil record of South
America after their arrival on the
island continent; however the earliest
phases of the evolutionary history of
monkeys in South America have been
the subject of extensive debate.
This new discovery, published in
Nature, may provide the first real
evidence for the African ancestry of
platyrrhine primates.
Found in the sediment deposits of
a river bank in the Santa Rosa fossil
site, located in a remote region of
eastern Peru, the tiny fossils have
been dated to approximately 36
million years ago, during the Late
Eocene epoch.
Their discovery extends the fossil
record of South American primates
back by 10 million years; previously
the oldest known New World
monkeys dated from 26 million years
ago, during the Late Oligocene epoch
in Salla, Bolivia.
The fossils were first discovered in
2010, though it took two years for the
first to be recognised as a primitive
monkey specimen as it was such an
unusual find for South America.
“Fossils are scarce and limited
to only a few exposed banks along
rivers during the dry seasons,”
said co-author Dr Ken Campbell,
a curator at the Natural History
Museum of Los Angeles County. “For
much of the year high water levels
make paleontological exploration
impossible”.
Under these difficult conditions,
and at just a few millimetres across
in size, it is unsurprising that the
fossilised molars remained unstudied
until now.
The initial identification spurred
on further efforts to analyse other
associated fossils from the Santa Rosa
local fauna.
Researchers have been searching
for a number of years in the Amazon
Basin of South America, one of the
most biologically diverse regions in
the world, for clues as to its ancient
biological past.
Campbell, working with a team of
Argentinian palaeontologists, has
recently focused his efforts on eastern
Peru in the hopes of understanding
the evolutionary origins of the area.
Previously, the gap in the fossil
record before the Salla primates led to
significantly different hypotheses on
the evolutionary history and origins
of New World monkeys.
The new specimens contrast
with previously known extinct and
living South American primate
species, instead bearing a striking
resemblance to African anthropoids
of the Eocene epoch. Phylogenetic
analysis suggests a relationship with
African taxa.
While the researchers have
presented three preliminary
hypotheses, they state that more
specimens are necessary to narrow
down the ancestry of the newly
discovered species.
Epigenetic factors behind
asthma and other allergic
diseases have been identified
by a group at Imperial College
in research that could lead to
better targeted and more effective
treatments. Their paper, published
in Nature, identifies 34 genes
related to inflammation, inhibited
in healthy people, but overexpressed
in those with allergies.
Epigenetics has been a bit of a
buzzword in biology in the past
few years, as it seems to provide
an explanation for many complex
aspects of life that cannot be
explained by a naïve interpretation
of how our genes work.
Simply having a gene doesn’t
mean it will be expressed.
Environmental factors can turn
them on or off by adding methyl
groups at specific points on the
DNA, which prevent it being read
and forming proteins. Levels of
methylation have been linked to
ageing and the growth of cancers,
and could even provide some
explanation for the beneficial effects
of exercise, and the lifelong negative
effects of childhood traumas.
The researchers analysed the blood
of people with asthma and measured
the level of methylation of genes
that regulate the production of IgE
(Immunoglobulin E), an antigen that
causes inflammation. They found 36
locations on 34 genes that had very
low levels of methylation in those
with asthma. There was a strong
correlation between the activity of
these genes and the levels of IgE in
the patient’s blood. These findings
were backed up by similar results
obtained by a group in Canada.
Some of the genes identified encode
proteins produced by eosinophils,
a type of white blood cell known to
cause inflammation in the lungs.
Drugs to reduce the activity of
eosinophils are sometimes given
to asthma sufferers, but this new
research could allow genetic testing
to identify people who could benefit
from them. It also offers potential
targets for new classes of drugs to
treat patients whose asthma does not
respond well to current treatments.
5 million people in the UK are
currently receiving treatment for
asthma, which is caused when the
airways of the lungs become inflamed
and narrowed, restricting the passage
of air. It is closely related to eczema
and hay fever, the so-called ‘atopic
triad’, which are also caused by high
IgE levels.
The research was led by Miriam
Moffatt and William Cookson
from the National Heart and Lung
Institute. Professor Cookson said:
“Our pioneering approach, using
epigenetics, allowed us to obtain
insights that we weren’t able to get
from traditional genetics. It isn’t just
the genetic code that can influence
disease and DNA sequencing can
only take you so far. Our study shows
that modifications on top of the DNA
that control how genes are read may
be even more important.”
