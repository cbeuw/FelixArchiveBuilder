Don’t drink and drive – but if you do, call me
Joshua Renken gives his two cents on the new Breaking Bad spin-off series, Better Call Saul
"Three
episodes
in and the
show is
shaping up
nicely."
Uttered by criminal lawyer and
opportunist Saul Goodman
(Bob Odenkirk) in the final
season of Breaking Bad, the words
“Don’t drink and drive – but if you
do, call me” give you an idea of
the unscrupulous and charismatic
character he was throughout the now-
classic series. But Saul wasn’t always
like that.
In Breaking Bad, Saul Goodman
becomes Walter and Jesse’s legal
counsel as their meth cooking
operation grows. Jesse convinces Walt
to meet with Saul by explaining that
in this business “you don’t want a
criminal lawyer... you want a criminal
lawyer”. It becomes clear that no
job is too small, or too depraved, for
Goodman, who provides invaluable
assistance to the pair from series two
onwards.
Whether it’s laundering drug
money, disposing of incriminating
evidence or cleaning up crime scenes,
Saul can solve all their problems, for
a fee. When asked how he gets these
things done, he simply answers, “Let’s
just say I know a guy… who knows a
guy… who knows another guy.” Walt
and Jesse soon become his major
clients as the drug money rolls in
and their situation becomes more
complicated.
Saul Goodman provided light
relief and gallows humour in the
dark storyline that is Walter White’s
transformation. Walt goes from being
a chemistry teacher with a cancer
diagnosis to the feared crystal meth
cook and millionaire drug kingpin
‘Heisenberg’. When the streak of
luck inevitably ends, every character
suffers. Goodman’s last line in
Breaking Bad was “It’s all over.” Not
so. Now Saul Goodman, real name
Jimmy McGill, has a television
series of his own. Set in 2002, Better
Call Saul is a spin-off prequel series
written by Breaking Bad creators
Vince Gilligan and Peter Gould, that
follows the small-time Albuquerque
lawyer seven years before he becomes
Walt and Jesse’s attorney.
Jimmy McGill’s situation at
the start of the series is every bit
as dark and depressing as Walter
White’s. Both series are essentially
about intelligent, solitary men
who feel financially pressured into
breaking the law. Better Call Saul will
inexorably feature a pivotal moment
when Jimmy’s idealism completely
crashes, and he becomes Saul
Goodman. This is going to be a darkly
comic, bitter sweet show.
The series cuts between Saul’s life
before and after meeting Walt, and
has already featured a few of the most
memorable characters from Breaking
Bad. The audience is already aware of
what happens after Saul first meets
with Walt, but what happened in the
time leading up to establishing his
strip-mall law office in Albuquerque,
New Mexico? It is this question that
Breaking Bad fans want an answer to,
and Better Call Saul will give them
their answer.
It’s too early to know whether this
series is going to become as popular as
its parent drama, but three episodes
in and the show is shaping up nicely.
By tapping into the huge pre-existing
fan base, the opening episode of Better
Call Saul broke the record for the
highest overall viewership of a series
premiere in US cable history. The
first season consists of ten episodes
and the series has already been
renewed for a second season of 13
episodes.
This series will be judged on the
quality of the central performance,
and Bob Odenkirk knows this.
Luckily, he has had several years
to master the ‘slick-talking sleazey
lawyer’ role and Odenkirk plays
it to perfection. Better Call Saul is
judiciously humanising the slightly
two-dimensional character that
viewers enjoyed so much in its parent
drama, in a way that feels familiar to
any fan of Vince Gilligan’s previous
work. The series is confidently shot
and moves at the pace of a sloth on
valium, but somehow the lingering
scenes only serve to intensify the
emotions of the characters and
add gravitas to a given situation.
Crucially, Better Call Saul never
feels too slow (Perhaps it would if
one hadn’t already been exposed to
dozens of hours of Breaking Bad). The
two shows are stylistically identical to
each other. Saul’s story is a complex
one and those involved in making the
series understand that they should
take their sweet time in telling it.
Better Call Saul is another dark
character study that painstakingly
details the metamorphosis of its
protagonist from a struggling citizen
to a professional criminal. If anyone
can do it, and do it right, it’s Vince
Gilligan.
Better Call Saul premiered on
February 8th
and episodes are
uploaded on Netflix UK every
Wednesday.
