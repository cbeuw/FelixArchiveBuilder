Hayward Gallery
Radical
Histories:
what does
it means to
be British
today?
In the summer of 2014, in response
to the hysteria generated by the
‘Trojan Horse School’ scandal, the
Education Secretary Michael Gove
issued an edict stating that schools
in the UK must begin promoting
that most nebulous of terms: British
Values. In an age when it is just as
easy to speak to a friend in Lagos as
it is to phone our grandparents in
Woking; when foodie culture means
that everyone’s palate is globally
educated; when people can move
through the EU at will, breaking
down notions of private borders; what
does it really mean to be British?
It is this question that has been
posed to seven artist-curators in the
Southbank Centre’s show History Is
Now, in which the years 1945-2015
are radically reinterpreted, and the
cultural legacy of the second half
of the 20th
Century is celebrated.
Does Britishness mean a sleeping
video of David Beckham, as it does
to Simon Fujiwara? Or perhaps it is
best represented by governmental
reports on BSE, the offering of Roger
Hiorns? Certainly everything in
Britain is not peachy keen; this much
can be ascertained before you reach
the exhibition, when one spies the
surface-to-air missile installed on the
Hayward Gallery’s roof, ominously
pointing to an invisible target.
The missile forms part of the
collection of Richard Wentworth,
who looks back to his childhood
for inspiration; the oldest of all
the curators, Wentworth sees the
years 1940-60 as a formative period
for British culture. The end of the
war lead to a widespread, if uneasy,
optimism, as Britons took their first
new steps into a brave new world of
TV sets and polyurethane. This shift
towards consumer culture is reflected
in Tony Cragg’s work Britain Seen
from the North, in which a jumble
of plastic flotsam forms the outline
of the British Isle; tilted on its side,
the country seems prone under the
weight of its newly accumulated
wealth. It was this optimism that lead
to the foundation of the Hayward
Gallery, part of the Southbank Centre
development created during the
Festival of Britain, an irony that
cannot be overlooked.
However, not all was peaceful in the
land of plenty. While they seemed
to be free of the threat of invasion, a
vein of violence still ran to the core
of British society; we therefore have
Henry Moore’s bulbous sculptures,
unnerving in their fluidity, and
Francis Bacon’s psychological
explorations of the human form, in
which figures seem to melt into each
other. Robert Capa’s shots of the
D-Day landings, iconic in their shaky
quality, show that we will indeed fight
them on the beaches; but Lowry’s
scene of a popular sandy shore shows
that we will live, laugh, and love on
the beaches too.
Perhaps what is at the heart of
being British lies in our institutions;
the NHS, for example, which is the
country’s largest employer, and
which forms the centre of Barbara
Hepworth’s Hospital Drawings series,
part of Wentworth’s display. This
idea of institutions is continued by
Simon Fujiwara, whose curation of
a number of artefacts of Britishness
is inspired. Taking as inspiration the
fundamental shift from material to
immaterial production that occurred
during the reign of Thatcher and
carried on for the next thirty years,
Fujiwara’s collection manages to be
both eclectic and focussed.
The role Thatcher played is
represented by the costume worn
by Meryl Streep in The Iron Lady, a
white-washed biopic of the divisive
leader who fundamentally altered
the British economy; next to it we
have a ton of coal, taken from the
Minorca Surface Mine, one of the
country’s last open coal mines. This
smooth slab, which was hewn from
the very earth, seems as unfamiliar
and unnatural as a piece of alien
technology, a fact that is subtly
alluded to by Gavin Turk’s Trash, a
bronze case of a bin bag. In fact, it is
somewhat ironic to have Thatcher
represented here; how could she have
believed in ‘British Values’ when she
stated that “there is no such thing as
society”, a claim succinctly refuted
by the brooms used by community
clear-up teams following the Summer
2011 riots, on display next to Streep’s
costume.
Above all, Fujiwara’s collection
reveals the contradictions inherent
within British society. Our obsession
with class and aspirational lifestyles
is represented by empty packets of
Waitrose herbs and Nigella Lawson
salad servers, which are juxtaposed
against a place setting for The Clink
Restaurant, a charity scheme that
employs and trains prisoners. The
contrast between physicality and
immateriality is shown through Prem
Sahib’s Sweat Panel, which creates
the illusion of a steamed mirror
through the meticulous application
of hundreds of resin drops. Towards
