into the myriad ways to
volunteer while you’re
studying
“It’s time for you to get involved” –
Student Volunteering Week 2015
“Hiya! Do you have a few
moments to volunteer
for a good cause?“ “Ah
sorry I’m in a hurry” This dialogue
has occurred in the JCR for too
long. And as students, who are
stereotypically drunk 24/7, it is time
for us to stand up and change public
perceptions.
The National Student Volunteering
Week (SVW) is taking place next
week. Imperial will be one of many
universities over the UK to celebrate
the positive impact made by student
volunteers in their communities,
raise awareness of the value of student
volunteering and inspire more
students to get involved. A group of
Imperial Hub SVW Champions and
I have been working together since
November to deliver a fun-packed
programme for you all next week!
We all know why we should
volunteer. It provides a great warm
feeling to be able to give something
back to the community and make
a difference to people who are less
fortunate than us. According to recent
figures volunteering contributes
£4.8 billion to UK GNP, and many
charities just could not carry out the
initiatives they have without the help
of volunteers. Volunteering not only
contributes a social impact to the
community, but also economically to
the country.
But what most people forget is that
volunteering is a two-way process.
Yes, a lot of it is about you giving your
time and effort, but throughout the
journey you will earn invaluable skills
and meet amazing people, as well as
having some some fun away from
labs and destressing!
Volunteering increases your
exposure to the world, since
different opportunities uncover
different social issues. Being around
one of the wealthiest boroughs in
London, it might be easy to assume
that everything is fine. We see big
expensive cars on the road, school
children wearing their hats on
scooters and, of course, the many
shoppers coming out of Harrods with
expensive handbags and cutlery.
The truth of the matter is, the
life expectancy at St. Charles is
nine years lower than that of the
Queens Gate area, though it is only a
short 30 minute bus trip away. Life
expectancy says a lot when it comes
to the living standards and welfare of
residents and this just uncovers the
deep social issues on our doorstep.
The more knowledge we have on the
surroundings, the more informed
decisions we can make in life.
Personally, since volunteering with
Imperial Hub, I have changed quite
a few of my habits and make more
ethical choices day to day.
If you are ready to move on to
a higher level, being a volunteer
manager is even more rewarding.
Whether you are coordinating a
regular community project or being
a club officer in your clubs and
societies, the experience provides you
with many transferrable skills, from
effective communication, to problem
solving, to planning and organising
events. Being Imperialites, we can
receive training through the Union’s
Imperial Plus scheme, as well as the
weekly Lunch and Learn sessions by
Imperial Hub.
These programmes not only
recognise the time and effort you
have put into volunteering, but also
the different skills you have gained,
with both schemes offering the
opportunity to gain qualifications.
Not to mention the privilege to
be nominated for Community
Connections Volunteer of the Year at
the annual Union Awards!
Many of you who have started
looking for jobs would have
encountered competency questions.
What could be a better answer than
your volunteering experience to
show that you are a rounded young
professional? In fact, a survey has
shown that amongst 200 of the
UK’s leading businesses, 73% of the
employers would hire someone with
volunteer experience over someone
without, and 94% of employees who
volunteered to learn new skills had
benefited either by getting their first
job, improving their salary, or being
promoted; a reminder that your time
spent volunteering now may be paid
back in the future.
All sounds good and ready to give it
a go? Well you’re not alone! Currently
almost 400 students take part in over
35 different opportunities, many of
whom are regular volunteers – for
example, Schools Plus tutors last year
collectively spent 1340 hours tutoring
kids from a poorer background,
inspiring the next generation of
scientists and engineers. Have a look
at what some of the volunteers have
said and why they enjoy it so much!
Last year, 100% of SVW volunteers
agreed that participating in SVW
had been a positive experience for
them, so it’s now time for you to get
involved!
