New halls to be built in Durham
Hangman’s Finest College News Source

mperial’s newest halls will
be located in Durham, if new
plans announced in an incred-
ibly impartial article are to be
believed. he article said “our
glorious leaders have taken skill and
courage to come up with this amaz-
ing opportunity”. When asked about
distance to a campus, they report-
edly looked at the ﬂoor and said “Erm,
yeah. Well, it’s close to A CAMPUS.
hat’s the point right? Yeah, it’s Dur-
ham’s campus, but, come on, there
will be fun people there right?”.
he plans are not exactly students’
cup of tea, with most not keen on the
idea. he commute, claimed by Col-
lege to be 5 minutes, is widely dis-
puted.
he shocking news comes later on
in the decision process than most
would have liked. his has surprised
the university, as they thought that
people would applaud the initiative
taken and the fact that they didn’t
want to bother students with deci-
sions like this.
Many students have forgotten that
they are supposed to just take eve-
rything lying down as was agreed in
1950, and have spoken out against the
move. It remains to be seen if a sen-
sible solution involving someone who
has made a dick move realising that
their idea is a bad plan and therefore
ﬁnding a way to change their decision
will occur or not.
he rumours of halls on Jupiter are
“unfounded”. his is probably be-
cause of the inhospitable atmosphere
and large travel time; although, judg-
ing by Paragon, this probably isn’t
a major concern, so Imperial were
likely outbid.
Rap lyrics of
the week
“Junior high school I had a crush on
the Principal,
I guess I was turned on by the
leadership”
This is basically included as that’s
just a hilarious line. An interesting
fetish that, for leadership. Where
was that from? The school of writ-
ing corporate cover letters with
bullshit jargon in them?
Chiddy: “High”
“So I dash, I ducks and I hides
behind a tree ”
Before we even get into the stupid
quote, let’s tackle the song title.
Fuck money, for the love of God
learn to spell. Please.
Right, now, on to the strange-
ness of this. Again, the English
is a bit dodgy, but whatever. He
is saying that he is running away
from the police, by hiding behind a
tree? Is that really the most effec-
tive strategy to evade the police?
How many suspects have you seen
on the news have “the armed rob-
ber is thought to have evaded the
police and helicopters by taking
refuge behind a small oak tree”.
None. That’s going to get you on
America’s Dumbest Criminals.
Eazy-E : “Foe tha love of
money”
Think you’re funny?
Maybe you are. Or,
more likely, people are
just laughing at you.
Either way. Write an
article and send it in:

Stop pretending to like work
Work. It’s dull, tiring, and for the most
part you gently sweat in an overly
warm lecture theatre surrounded by
pig-faced course”mates”, feeling the
deep acidic tang of your greasy neigh-
bour’s BO tickling the back of your
throat.
So stop telling your friends you like
your course. Fuck oﬀ. It’s annoying,
and makes everyone feel bad. You feel-
ing good when queeﬁng-oﬀ to your
chums about how much work you’re
doing isn’t beneﬁcial to society, it’s
harmful. So stop pretending to enjoy
the lecturere’s notes so fucking much
and remember that you are a funda-
mentally worthless nothing. Even if
God was real he probably wouldn’t
like you. And neither do your parents.
“Come! Swim in the mind-pool of
my overwhelming enthusiasm!” Cry
these self-validating mono-plebs as
they travel from one productive ac-
tivity to another. “Take my throb-
bing enthuse-ability into your mouth
and choke on the salty fruits of my
labour!” Together we must stand up
against these fountains of vapidity,
wipe their cerebral juices from our
lips, and crush this behaviour.
Sadly, this phenomenon is spread-
ing. On a tour of a lab group recently
a bright eyed and bushy tailed pro-
spective applicant turned to me only
and said “Oh, I can’t believe that you
can actually get paid for research!!”.
Yes you fucking can, it’s a job, like
any other. And a poorly paid one
at that. If you had told me how sur-
prised you were at the low salaries for
research posts, then maybe I would
have listened to the rest of your exter-
nal-but-we-all-wish-it-was-internal
monologue, and not spent the time
reminiscing of when I was a young
child and the myxomatosis laden rab-
bit had wondered into the shed and I
showed Daddy what a big boy I was
by ending the life of the ﬂuﬀy little
creature with nothing more than a
rusty claw hammer and bit of good ol’
fashioned steely-eyed determination,
and how much funnier it would have
been if the rabbit’s face had been re-
placed with your face, and how much
less Mummy would have cried if she
hadn’t seen me smiling . hese people
need help!
Like for most things, I blame the
banks. And the nonce that invented
the curriculum vitae. “Suitable appli-
cants must demonstrate enthusiasm
and interest through regular reader-
ship of suitable publications”. No one
ﬁnds hedge funds interesting! It’s not
possible. hey only pretend to be-
cause they want to make money and
gradually privatise the NHS.
So remember that it is o.k. Not to
like things, and to do things that ben-
eﬁt your life in the long term without
drawing immediate enjoyment from
them. Take a moment to consider the
bored and the disillusioned before you
open your mouth, and ask yourself
everytime: “Am I a prick?”.
Plans for halls in Essex rejected as it was “too far”
Just admit You didn’t find that lecture “interesting”
Imperial students
will probably now not
get to be on TOWIE
Rocks. Some people’s
subjects involve spending
all day looking at these. As
if anyone likes that
