Populist Legislation Sure to Destroy
London’s Economy
Ross Gray
ell, this is turn-
ing into a de-
lightful little
serial isn’t it?
Today, I would
like to discuss the most controversial
of all issues concerning investment
banking: remuneration. his has been
a hot topic since the (thoroughly un-
derstandable) moral outrage at bank-
ers still raking in massive bonuses fol-
lowing the crisis. Whilst I understand
this viewpoint, there is a piece of leg-
islation coming in from the EU that is
pretty much sheer insanity; which will
almost certainly destroy our ﬁnancial
services sector and deepen any future
recessions. I know everyone dislikes
bankers these days but I can’t help
but feel we might miss the substantial
amount of GDP and tax they contrib-
ute once the EU has decimated what
was once the jewel in the British eco-
nomic crown.
Of course, I am discussing the pro-
posed cap on bonuses. I believe the
only reason this suggestion has actu-
ally got through is because to anyone
involved in the industry and to British
politicians, it was so utterly ludicrous
nobody gave it a second thought. For
those unaware, the EU is proposing a
1:1 cap of variable:ﬁxed income in a
banker’s pay (i.e. your bonus is capped
at 1x base salary). here is a clause to
allow for 2x base salary with share-
holder approval, which I would be as-
tonished if any banks fail to get.
In my mind, this is a bow to pop-
ulism with very little thought put into
the damage it could do. Or possibly,
in the case of Germany and France
– long embittered by having to pay
the downside of our risks whilst we
reap all the beneﬁts – a great deal of
thought put into the damage it could
do. Essentially, the reason this won’t
work is because it’s aimed at reduc-
ing total compensation. I would be
amazed if that happens.
An investment bank (I’m talking
pure corporate advisory at the mo-
ment) is a human capital-intensive
business. heir only expenditure is
their employees. As such, why on
earth wouldn’t they give as much as
they possibly can to their employees?
It makes economic sense. he purpose
of a public company is essentially to
generate value for their shareholders.
If they don’t pay out as much as pos-
sible of revenue to the bankers who
generate the money, what are they go-
ing to do with the rest? hey could sit
on it in a large cash pile; that screams
A defence of banking’s most controversial practice: bonuses
incompetent cor-
porate governance.
hey could invest it
into the company to
drive up the stock
price. hat would
be good. hat is ex-
actly what they do
by paying their best
bankers generously.
hey are investing
their capital in the
most eﬀective way
possible. Conse-
quently, the chances
of them substan-
tially reducing com-
pensation are pretty
much nil. his is not
good.
Let’s say we have a
rock-star managing
director. He brings
in over £100m a year
in fees, so conse-
quently gets a £600k
base salary and
£9.4m bonus. here
is no way an advi-
sory ﬁrm would let
this employee go if
he continues to per-
form. Consequent-
ly, they will end up
paying him a £5m
base salary, which is
pure insanity. Let us
now propose there’s
another recession.
his company has
many similar rock-
star MDs (they only
hire the best). Sadly
now there’s no busi-
ness to go around,
no matter how good
you are at making
deals. Previously,
the bank’s intrinsic risk management
system – and yes, that is eﬀectively
what bonuses are – would’ve kicked
in. he £9.4m bonus would’ve been
axed, the MDs could all have kept
their jobs and continued contribut-
ing to the economy, albeit at a lower
rate. If the bank has a £5m ﬁxed cost,
they cannot do this. A large propor-
tion of the MDs would have to be ﬁred
for the business to remain proﬁtable.
Not only would this destroy corporate
value in the long term (if you don’t see
how this aﬀects you, imagine what it
will do to your future pension if all
ﬁnance equities slide 70%); it would
also make the recession that triggered
this scenario an incredible amount
more severe.
I personally think the sane answer to
the compensation question for bank-
ers who work in risky divisions, such
as debt packaging (or, you know, trad-
ing: that division whose sins bank-
ers often have attributed to them), is
bail-in able bonds. Cap cash bonuses
at 1x base salary, sure: that’s deﬁnitely
a good idea, as high cash bonuses do
tend to encourage reckless risk taking.
But allow bankers to have a higher
variable payment than this in the form
of bonds that will be the ﬁrst port of
call when the company needs a bail-
out. Keep the heady compensation,
as much as it angers the populace,
but make these bankers the ﬁrst port
of call when it hits the fan. Maybe, if
the bankers were aware the major-
ity of their compensation was up for
grabs if their actions turned out to be
too risky and have a negative eﬀect on
the bank, nothing would ever hit the
fan. Or, you know, you could just cap
all bonuses and drive up ﬁxed costs.
In this scenario, who will be respon-
sible for taking the ﬁnancial burden of
bailing out the banks when it all inevi-
tably goes wrong again? hat’s right –
you, the taxpayer, not those dastardly
bankers who caused all the trouble in
the ﬁrst place.
“
The reason
this won’t
work is
because it’s
aimed at
reducing total
compen-
sation. I
would be
amazed if
that happens.
