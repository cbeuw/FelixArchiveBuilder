Paragon: a case study of distance
Tim Arbabzadah Editor-in-Chief
Paragon halls are located in Brentford,
about six and a half miles from the
South Kensington campus of Imperial
College London, which is where most
students need to be every day. he use
of the halls is a temporary stopgap
measure; the problem was caused by
the last minute renovation of Wilson
House. hey are a shared halls: Impe-
rial, University of West London and
hames Valley College all share the
space. here are 176 rooms for fresh-
ers in Paragon, each room costing
£155 per week. his does not factor in
the travel cost per day that is needed
to get into College. hey are all single
study bedrooms (with en suites) and
arranged in cluster ﬂats of eight with
a shared kitchen.
Felix contacted Jon Matthews, Para-
gon Warden, for comment. He said
that there “have been diﬃculties”. He
said that it has “always been [a case
of] managing expectations”. When
asked to highlight the main problem
that there is with the halls, he replied:
“he main issue is distance from Col-
lege”. He went on to say: “students
spending two hours a day are going to
have [a] lesser experience than those
spending 20 minutes walking”. his
was likely referring to Evelyn Gardens
and other closer accommodation. He
said that there were not necessarily
welfare concerns, but the student ex-
perience was diminished in compari-
son to those students in closer accom-
modation. He said that the wardening
team “do our best, but no matter what
events we do, there’s always that com-
mute”. Paragon does have commu-
nal space, but it is not exclusively for
Imperial. here have reportedly been
problems with mixing between the
universities. he diﬀerent universities
have attempted to advertise events to
each other, however, there has been
little uptake so far.
He said that Paragon was College’s
“only real option to taking in the stu-
dents”. he original plan was to house
students in Elephant and Castle. his
was opposed by the Union last year.
here have been many problems
with Paragon this year. he vast ma-
jority have been due to the distance.
Many students have tried to change
halls, and it is believed that there are
up to 2-3 complaints per week about
the distance. he College website
states that Paragon is “ideally located
for students studying in central and
west London”. However, the com-
mute to and from College has been
highlighted by many students as be-
ing too long. Paragon Warden, Jon
Matthews was asked about the travel
time issue. He said: “Door to door
travel time is about one hour. Times
that I do take the tube, can get back
in 45 minutes, but that is with perfect
connections. Realistically, looking at
about an hour. If one cannot aﬀord to
be late [i.e. exam], I would say add 15
minutes on to an hour just in case.” To
mitigate this problem there is a shut-
tle bus available to South Ealing on the
Picadilly Line. However it is ﬁve days
a week and not run by Imperial; Paul
Noke, Head of Residential Services
and GradPad, previously told Felix
that College “pay a small contribution
to allow our students access… to the
shuttle busses”. Although there are
times in the morning when students
Paragon, described on the Univer-
sity web-site as: “a high-quality,
award-winning, purpose-built hall
of residence with excellent trans-
port links and good shopping and
leisure facilities available”, has been
a source of quite some controversy
amongst Imperial students. Sounds
idyllic, so what’s the problem?
Primarily it’s the distance. With
the closest tube station located in
zone 4 of the Piccadilly line, the 40
minute commute to university is
gruelling, especially for a 9am start.
After a 10 min bus journey there fol-
lows the challenge of pushing one’s
way onto a central bound train.
Usually there are no free seats, so
we stand. Even so, it is not uncom-
mon for it to be so crowded that
we are forced to wait for the next
train. Paragon is situated so far out
that the underground runs above
ground. Now that is saying some-
thing; so much for “excellent trans-
port links”.
Secondly it’s the location of the
actual Hall of Residence. Situated
in Northfields, Brentford, I find it
misleading to promulgate the shop-
ping and leisure facilities in this
area. When I look out of my flat win-
dow, I have an excellent view of the
GlaxoSmithKlein headquarters as
well as the M4. Maybe I’m being un-
fairly critical; it does have its perks.
Besides from tall buildings and cars
there is also a Petrol station, a Co-op
and a local Fullers pub!
Finally Paragon is impractical and
overpriced. Due to its location there
is no way of oscillating between
Halls and South Kensington dur-
ing the day. This means two things:
packed lunches and long days. Once
you’ve left Paragon, you’re commit-
ted to staying on campus.
This leaves you with the choice
of either become a hyper-efficient
expert in time management and
organisation; or quite the opposite.
Many decide to not go in for lec-
tures in the first place. After all, they
are recorded, sparing you a 1 ½ hour
commute that day.
With summer exams coming up
and the university work load build-
ing up the “Paragon Paradox” is
becoming ever more transparent to
us. It is safe to say that I write this
on behalf of all Paragon Residents,
who are all equally frustrated with
their living conditions and the bla-
tant unfairness of our situation. The
incontrovertible truth: Brentford,
Middlesex is not South Kensington,
London.
Hopefully this article will call into
question the plans to develop a new
undergraduate hall of residence,
W3, in North Acton. Please not an-
other Paragon!

We are only 70 metres from South

from Imperial are not allowed to use
them. hese stop at 8:30pm. here are
then MPVs from South Ealing to Para-
gon until 12:30am, which, for a fresher
on a ‘big night out’ is not very late.
Plus this is only three days a week, as
not enough use has been shown to jus-
tify extending it. Much like Paragon, it
has been suggested that the social life
of having so many students in one area
will not be able to take away from the
daily commute.
he quality of the accommodation
has also been called into question.
he College website states the fol-
lowing: “Paragon is a high-quality,
award-winning, purpose-built hall of
residence in Brentford operated by
Touareg Trust, part of the Notting Hill
Housing Group.” However, it has been
noted that the showers are not very
good, as they have low water pressure
and do not spray water straight down.
he heat has also been noted. It is be-
lieved that to get the shower up to a
higher temperature, one needs to run
a cold tap. he heating has also been
highlighted to Felix by an anonymous
source. he heating was said to take
up to two hours to heat the room, and
that the room only stayed warm for a
short amount of time. here are more
problems, which have been highlight-
ed by anonymous accounts to Felix.
One of these is below, and another is
in Comment on page 20.
Although the majority of students
in halls this year were not in Paragon,
for those that were it was the only ﬁrst
year experience that they will get (bar-
ring retaking exams or starting at a
diﬀerent university).
