n light of the Sex Survey, I
thought: why not conduct
my own Food Survey? It’s
not exactly the most highly
scientiﬁc of surveys (*dodges
open ﬁre*), but answered by Felix
food writers and fellow food lovers,
maybe the survey will give a new life
into the food on campus – or not,
in some cases. Most of the people
I asked ate at Imperial outlets on a
regular, weekly basis. About a third
of the people I asked only ate in uni
very rarely, when they’ve forgotten
their packed lunches or are staying
in late – can anything really beat a
homemade lunch? I think so.
Try the most popular place to eat,
FUEL, oh yes, that ‘pie place’ with
the inﬁnite mash and gravy (appar-
ently the beetroot smoothies are
good too). Everyone I asked who
had been to FUEL (apart from one,
crazy person) said it was great. he
favourite pies were the chicken based
pies, either with ham or chorizo (the
Matador pie). But hold out you hun-
gry meat eaters – apparently the
goat’s cheese one is also fantastic.
In general, most people I asked felt
the pies are good value for money,
considering that they are handmade
and you can ﬁll your pie box full to
the brim with mash and gravy, given
that there isn’t a helpful but annoy-
ing person serving it out. People felt
that the salad and chicken or salmon
boxes are also good, healthier than
the pies, but more expensive. I can
empathise with the complaints re-
garding when Pieminister run out of
the best pies. It can also get pretty
crowded in there.
he second most popular place
to eat lunch was the JCR, basi-
cally because of the large selection
of sandwiches and wraps, which is
obviously an easy and cheap lunch.
he Library Café was in third place,
again because of the sandwich-lovers
amongst us and of course, the jacket
potatoes, the favourite ﬁlling being
chilli. For a hot meal, the jacket po-
tato is probably the cheapest thing
on campus and will keep you going
throughout the rest of the day. In
fourth place was the Queen’s Tower
Rooms (QTR), a hot meal on its own
will only take you back a few quid,
whereas the meal deal will take you
back around £5. he meal deal is very
ﬁlling, so either go there with a mas-
sive appetite or an intention to sleep
all afternoon. Because of my poor
question-asking skills many people
said their favourite place to eat at uni
was he Sandwich Shop on Glouces-
ter Road. I felt I should mention it
because everyone does rave about it
– they also do noodles if you’re not in
a sandwich mood. Fans of he Sand-
wich Shop feel these sandwiches are
sometimes tastier and better value
than the ones at uni outlets.
Producing good academic work
requires a half decent cup of cof-
fee. Just over half the people I asked
prefer EEE and the rest prefer the
Library Café. One person said the
SAF coﬀee was ‘terrible’ – so I may
avoid that in future. he Chemistry
café was not voted so highly, though
this was probably because only a few
Chemists did the survey. hey say the
coﬀee there is fantastic – apparently
you may even be served by an award
winning barista, so if you haven’t
done so already head over! People
do seem to like their local places,
whether that’s the RSM or Business
School café. I think it’s good to keep
trying new things, for a list of coﬀee
outlets at uni, check out: www3.im-
perial.ac.uk/eatinganddrinking/cate-
ringoutlets.
Everyone who snacks goes to the
Union Newsagents and 50% of them
snack at the JCR. I was surprised to
see that only one person snacked on
fruit and everyone else snacked on
crisps, chocolate and pick ‘n’ mix
– apparently we’re all glutinous fat-
ties. For breakfast snacks I was given
some great advice, to crash the SCR
in the mornings, apparently you can
buy porridge or make up a large yo-
ghurt and muesli pot for around 60p.
When it came to healthy foods,
most people felt that the salad boxes
in SAF and FUEL are more expen-
sive than just buying a sandwich
or jacket potato. hey are right, in
FUEL a salad box with salmon costs
more than pie and mash – but not
by much, around 50p. One person
felt the prices of juices and water is
too expensive. I disagree, I feel the
prices are competitive with super-
market prices. Unanimously, people
felt ripped oﬀ when it came to fruit
as snacks. hey might not necessarily
be more expensive, but people seem
to feel ripped oﬀ spending over 40p
The Food Survey
on a banana when they cost around
15p in a supermarket. Confectionary
does not seem to compare so unfa-
vourably to supermarket pricing.
Nevertheless, this mark-up is true
for all cafés from Café Nero to Star-
bucks. You know what I think? Bring
in a bag of apples or bananas at the
start of the week and leave them in
your locker – it’s much cheaper than
buying them every day at uni. Just
don’t forget about them.
Sophia Goldberg discusses the best and worst food on campus, where you can get the best lunch or coffee
and whether students are put off buying healthy foods because of the price tag.

Pollo Longinotti Al Forno
ElizabethCrow Writer
his extremely simple but impres-
sive dish originates from a Northern
Italian family.
It is perfect for serving to friends
and takes very little eﬀort. Chicken
thighs are a cheaper alternative to
breast and are both low in fat and
full of ﬂavour. hey are particularly
tender in this recipe, where they are
sealed to lock in moisture and ﬂa-
vour.
Ingredients (Serves 2)
4 boneless chicken thighs
1 ball of mozzarella
4 slices of parma ham (or similar)
500g carton passata
2 garlic cloves
Salt and pepper (chilli ﬂakes and bay
leaf optional)
1 tbsp olive oil
Cocktail sticks
Preparation
Preheat the oven to 180˚C. First heat
the oil in a pan, add in the chicken
thighs and seal until the outsides are
no longer pink.
Tear the mozzarella into 4 evenly
sized pieces, wrap each piece in a slice
of the ham and stuﬀ the parcels inside
each of the chicken thighs. Skewer
each thigh bundle with two cocktail
sticks to hold closed.
Place thighs in an oven proof dish.
Pour over the passata, peel and add the
garlic cloves and season to taste (if you
are using them, add the chilli ﬂakes
and bay leaf). Put this in the oven for 1
hour until cooked through (i.e. so that
the chicken no longer pink!)
Serve with small roasted or boiled
new potatoes as well as a green vegeta-
ble such as grilled courgettes, steamed
green beans or spinach.
