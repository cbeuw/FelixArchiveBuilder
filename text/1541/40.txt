here isn’t an easy way to describe or
to compliment the team eﬀort from
the Wachowski siblings and Tom
Tykwer, and their boldest, grandest
feature adaptation of Cloud Atlas,
based on the novel of the same name
by David Mitchell. All that can be said
is that it’s brilliant. Absolutely bril-
liant. Here is a ﬁlm of unimaginable
scale and ambition, six (and maybe an
extra half) diﬀerent narrative strands
all put together and connected beauti-
fully with endless smart editing, a true
work of wonder that needs to be seen.
It would be a crime to miss this mas-
terpiece on the big screen.
South Paciﬁc Ocean, 1849; Adam
Ewing (Sturgess), an American lawyer
working for his father-in-law (Weav-
ing), witnesses the whipping of a black
slave (Gyasi), who he later ﬁnds hid-
ing on his ship. he two strike up an
unlikely friendship, whilst the sinis-
ter Dr Henry Goose (Hanks) lurks in
the background interested in Ewing’s
wealth and fortune.
Edinburgh, Scotland, 1936; told
through many love letters from Rob-
ert Frobisher (Whishaw) to Rufus Six-
smith (D’Arcy), we follow Frobisher,
a young, enthusiastic, bisexual musi-
cian who is hired as an amanuensis to
famous, highly respected composer,
Vyvyan Ayrs (Broadbent). Frobisher
John Park Film Editor
himself ends up composing a brilliant
piece of music too, and is left shocked
and dumbfounded when Ayrs wants to
take credit for the young apprentice’s
work.
San Francisco, California, 1973;
journalist Luisa Rey (Berry) stumbles
upon what could be the biggest news
story and scandal of her career, going
after a corrupt energy company. With
some unexpected help from a cou-
ple of its employees (Hanks, D’Arcy),
Luisa gets closer to the truth, which
doesn’t sit well with the CEO (Grant).
United Kingdom, 2012; publisher
Timothy Cavendish (Broadbent) be-
comes an overnight sensation after
his gangster author Dermot Hoggins
(Hanks) impulsively throws a harsh
book critic oﬀ a building. His book
becomes a bestseller, and Cavendish
starts pocketing the cash, but not be-
fore Hoggins’ ﬁerce associates come
looking for their share in the proﬁts.
Although he turns to his older broth-
er (Grant) for help, he ﬁnds himself
locked up in a “retirement home”
ruled by the tyrannical Nurse Noakes
(Weaving).
Neo Seoul, Korea, 2144; Sonmi-451
(Bae) is a fabricant created solely for
the purpose of serving humans. Now
as a captured prisoner giving her ﬁnal
interview before her inevitable execu-
tion, she recounts the days that lead to
her arrest, starting with her encounter
with Hae-Joo Chang (Sturgess) a rebel
ﬁghter leading the resistance against
current society, their noble ﬁght, lead-
ing to her startling discovery behind
her creation.
A tropical island, 2321; set “106 win-
ters after he Fall”, most of humanity
has gone back to living in a primitive
society. Zachry (Hanks) is constantly
plagued by visions of Old Georgie
(Weaving), a dark spirit that taunts his
conscience. he arrival of Meronym
(Berry), a member of the “Prescients”,
who have held onto advanced technol-
ogy even during/after he Fall, sends
excitement and a hint of worry to the
tribesmen, as her intentions aren’t too
clear. Also living with the fear of be-
ing attacked/eaten by the cannibal-
istic Kona tribe, Zachry must make
the smart decision of whether to trust
Meronym or not.
So there you have it, six completely
diﬀerent plot strands, covering a wide
range of genres (you get everything:
action, adventure, comedy, drama,
fantasy, horror, romance, sci-ﬁ, thrill-
er), touching on too many themes to
list individually here. How do they all
ﬁt together? Is it even possible to link
500 years of material? Yes you can, and
you’ll have to watch to ﬁnd out how.
But what is impressive is how the
ﬁlm itself is never bogged down by its
dense material. he structure is clear,
the many characters, even in their
short appearances, are well-developed,
and the actors who are reused again
and again throughout the ﬁlm inhabit
their roles perfectly in the many var-
ied roles they play. It is hard to pick out
just a few from this fantastic interna-
tional group, as the cast all bring their
A-game as they are put through centu-
ries and centuries of events.
he actors frequently change their
race and their gender (seriously),
thanks to some incredible work done
in the make-up department. It’s also
fun to play a little game of who’s who,
trying to dissect the heavy prosthetic
make-up hiding their faces.
What we have here is no doubt an
example of hyperlink cinema, and
much like the greatest of this sub-gen-
re (Pulp Fiction, Babel, Crash, Magno-
lia, Traffic, City of God, 21 Grams, to
name a few), Cloud Atlas excels in es-
tablishing the crucial links, more chal-
lenging here since the directors are
covering 500 years’ worth of narrative,
as well as rounding oﬀ every segment
with a rewarding emotional punch.
he soundtrack also plays a crucial
role in these key moments, each ﬁnale
incorporating an immense piece of
exhilarating music, some composed
by Tykwer himself
Don’t be put oﬀ by how very little
ﬁnancial success this experienced in
the States. For whatever reason, this
didn’t go down well with audiences
there. But here is hoping Europe can
do better. Find the biggest screen, the
loudest speakers you possibly can, and
enjoy.
