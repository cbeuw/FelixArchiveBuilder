W3: A Welfare Perspective
The proposed halls will impact hugely on the welfare of students,
argues Becky Lane
t’s the topic of the moment
– the new halls that Imperial
College London Council has
approved in W3, North Ac-
ton. Some of you may have
been following the Twitter hashtag
#AgainstActon, seen the info about
the campaign on the Union website or
read Paul Beaumont’s blog post (op-
posite article). I’m going to assume
you know the basics, but here is my
lowdown on why I think the halls in
W3 will have some pretty serious con-
sequences for the welfare of the stu-
dents who get allocated these halls.
Personal safety should be a key
concern. In the Imperial College new
staﬀ orientation, staﬀ are told not to
walk through an estate less than a mile
away from the site of the new halls.
Crucially this is an estate that students
would need to walk through to get to
Westﬁeld. Medical students are also
warned away from this estate when
based at Hammersmith hospital – if
College deems this area so unsafe, why
locate 700 students there who are like-
ly to be new to London and potentially
to England? his seems like a strange
mixed message to me. here are many
other personal safety issues, it will
take two night buses to get back from
either the Union or Central London
after participating in an activity or a
night out. his either has the eﬀect of
putting our students at a higher level
of risk late at night, or decreasing en-
gagement with activities.
On the subject of engagement, Im-
perial College Union is proud of not
just the sheer number of Clubs, So-
cieties and Projects, but the level of
engagement that we have with our
students. We recognise that Clubs,
Societies and Projects fulﬁl many
functions for ﬁrst year students, for
example the overseas groups can real-
ly help a student from an international
background to acclimatise to life in
the UK. Many students also seek peer
support through their links in clubs
when they are going through a rough
patch, and maybe most importantly
they are fun. hey help students in
the high pressure environment that
is Imperial College to blow oﬀ some
steam! I strongly feel that the aver-
age participation and engagement of
students in W3 would be signiﬁcantly
less than students placed in either Beit
or Princes Gardens.
his is just one aspect of students
feeling disconnected from the Im-
perial College community; as the
community is South Kensington cen-
tric. When moving to a new city or
country, I think it is really important
to feel part of a community to make
that transition more manageable. Not
only should we consider our students
who engage with the Union through
Clubs, Societies and Projects, but
what about the students who rely on
the income from working part time
at the Union? As W3 is being mar-
keted as cheap accommodation, it is
reasonable to assume that some of the
students who live there may wish to
supplement their ﬁnances with some
part time work. he Union provides
ﬂexible part time work in its outlets
allowing students to earn extra money
without interfering on their studies.
Two night buses and the general dis-
tance may mean that students living
in North Acton are unable to do part
time work at the Union.
his year, some ﬁrst year students
have been placed in Paragon which is
located in Brentford. Although this is
not the same location, the travel time
is comparable to that of North Acton.
I strongly believe there have never
been so many students so unhappy
with the location of their halls. he
College Tutors and academics in de-
partments have mentioned that they
have had vast numbers of students
asking to be relocated to halls closer
to College. he main reason cited was
their levels of stress due to commuting
times. Spending over an hour per day
on public transport cuts into their re-
laxation time and students have com-
mented that the wake up early-travel-
lectures-travel-work-sleep routine has
been diﬃcult for them. hese students
have also raised concerns mentioned
in the previous paragraphs. It strikes
me that College Council should be
learning from previous location mis-
takes made by Campus Services, not
repeating them.
here is also the fact that these stu-
dents will not only be further away
from the Union, but the vast array of
services provided by College. As I
mentioned before, South Kensington
is the main hub of undergraduate ser-
vices, and as there is no plan to move
any undergraduate teaching to Impe-
rial West, it will be for the foreseeable
future. herefore, in 2015, there will
be 700 students who may not engage
with South Kensington based services
such as Ethos gym, the Disability
Advisory Service, the Counselling
Service and the Health Centre.
hese are all resources that should be
as simple as possible for students to
engage with. Even though these stu-
dents will be travelling to South Kens-
ington for lectures every day – due to
time constraints and pressures from
travelling, they may be less likely to
use these services. It should be made
as easy as possible for students to ac-
cess the help they need and distance
is a barrier.
he topic of wardening provision
has not yet been mentioned with re-
spect to W3. In smaller halls it is not
uncommon for the warden to know
the name of every student. With a
team of wardens, subwardens and hall
seniors, the transition of moving away
from home is made much more bear-
able. I don’t know many people who
could hold down a full time academic
position and look after (and know by
name) 700 undergraduates. I have a
sneaking suspicion that the wardening
provision will be much lower in W3,
which is worrying. We know that war-
dens provide frontline round the clock
pastoral support for students. A front
desk and 24 hour security could never
replace or even come close to this. A
hall is not just about stopping intrud-
ers entering, it is about fostering a safe
space and a community that ﬁrst
year students can ﬂourish in. Can this
be achieved in a hall a substantial dis-
tance away with an impersonal feel? I
don’t think so.
hese are my top worries about W3.
I am sure you have your own, some of
these things really do need answers
from the members of College staﬀ
spearheading this development. As a
Union our primary concern is the stu-
dent experience of our members, I
wish I could say the same of the deci-
sion makers behind this development.
“
A hall is ...
about fos-
tering a safe
space and a
community
that first year
students can
flourish in.
