FRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY
e Oscars: Best Picture
Life of Pi
Number of nominations: 11
Why it will win:
Filming the unﬁlmable, Ang
Lee has adapted Yann Martel’s
novel of many internal
monologues and very few
characters into the visual feast
event of the year. The fact
that Lee managed to create
something that is more than
watchable for two hours from
a book that was essentially
written off as one that could
never become a ﬁlm is a
remarkable achievement.
Why it won’t win:
Yes the special effects may be
marvellous and so might its
cinematography as well as its
editing and soundtrack. This
has very good chances with
thesecategories,buttheﬁlmas
a whole remains too abstract,
philosophical, ambiguous and
inaccessible to become a big
crowd-pleasing winner.
Lincoln
Number of nominations: 12
Why it will win:
Leading the Oscar race this
year is Steven Spielberg’s
Lincoln that has scooped
up the highest number of
nominations. Spielberg
certainly found himself an
excellent, committed cast to
play the many iconic roles, and
hisdecade-longresearchseems
to have paid off in recreating
theera,takingoneofAmerica’s
favourite Presidents, who
abolished slavery, bringing
him to the big screen. As
intelligent, informative as it
is entertaining, this certainly
clicked with the audience,
having bagged 100 million+
dollars already in the States.
Why it won’t win:
Spielberg is no doubt a big
name in Hollywood, but
has oddly only won the Best
Picture... once.
Silver Linings Playbook
Number of nominations: 8
Why it will win:
With a whopping number of
acting nominations (FOUR –
one for each acting category
(Bradley Cooper, Jennifer
Lawrence, Robert De Niro,
Jacki Weaver) – the ﬁrst ﬁlm to
do so since Reds in 1982), plus
a director nod for the always
daring David O. Russell and
a good steady box oice run,
there is a chance this could be
the surprise upset of the night.
Why it won’t win:
This doesn’t exactly ﬁt with
the generic Oscar Best Picture
winning type of ﬁlm, looking
too bright and chirpy for its
own good. Even with tackling
the serious theme of mental
illness, the ﬁlm itself looks
like a quirky romantic comedy
with a unique twist, not like
the grand biopics voters are
usually looking for.
Zero Dark Thirty
Number of nominations: 5
Why it will win:
Delivered by the same duo
(Kathryn Bigelow, Mark Boal)
who brought you the Oscar-
winning The Hurt Locker, they
are an expert when it comes
to expertly crafted thrillers
that need no big-scale, fancy,
expensive action but relies on
a solid lead performance and
taut narrative with a ﬁne eye
for small details.
Why it won’t win:
The controversy surrounding
the ﬁlm, however ridiculous,
absurd and off-base, can’t be
doing the ﬁlm any favours,
and although the box-oice
receipts are looking better
than that of The Hurt Locker,
ths flames have largely died
down on this one. Plus,
nothing for Kathryn Bigelow –
quite possibly the biggest snub
of this year’s nominations.
The awards season
is coming to an end
this Sunday with
the Oscars. So we
really won’t have
anything to write
about anymore. So
please...if you’ve
seen a film, any
film, good or bad,
please write to
us. Please, please.
Think of the cat.
