Letters Your thoughts on Acton-gate
Dear Sir,
Let’s be under no illusion: student
satisfaction ultimately derives from
friendships and action, really. When
students say they want to be in a Cen-
tral London location, one of their pri-
mary concerns is how much action
they’ll get (along with the friends they
will have).
Don’t let what anyone else says make
you think otherwise. North Acton is
hardly prime London. Imagine the
look on a potential one night stand’s
face when inviting them back to one’s
place, via the two night buses from Ti-
ger Tiger. Compare that to the suave
and sophisticated (and haute) South
Kensington. I think we know who will
be taking the skin boat to tuna town.
he Union don’t seem to want to fo-
cus on this point, but someone needs
to highlight it. Remember: Action =
Student Satisfaction, Forget Against
Acton, it’s: #NoActionInActon

Dear Sir,
Last week you highlighted how the
Union Council outvoted the Sabbs
Star letter on two issues. I believe that this high-
lights how out of touch with the com-
mon students the ‘Sabb clique’, are
in their cushty oﬃce, removed from
being students but still well sheltered
from the horror of the real world.
Surely now it is time for the Sabbs to
step up. he Against Acton campaign
launched on Tuesday is the next op-
portunity to show students that they
do actually have a voice in the running
of Imperial College and that that voice
is through their elected representa-
tives. We are not just ‘customers’ to be
dictated too by the whims of a com-
mercial services manager, we are not
clients or subscribers, we are students.
I believe the outcome of this cam-
paign, and the diﬀerence it makes will
be indicative of the state and power of
the Union, its councils and the Sabbs
as a whole. Too few students currently
care about the Union, and in particu-
lar the Union Council, believing that it
does little to beneﬁt them other than
running the clubs and societies and
the bars and swaddling everything they
do in red tape. Indeed what does the
DP(W) and DP(E) actually do on a day
to day basis? Send a few emails, go to
a few meetings? What cold, hard pro-
gress has been made over the last cou-
ple of years? Indeed, can anyone name
either of these DPs from two years ago?
Some people still don’t know who the
current ones are. Surely this campaign
is a chance for them to prove that they
are worth the combined £32K that they
cost all of us every year; a chance for
them to actually make a huge diﬀer-
ence to the future students.
his campaign, with the whole
weight of the Union and Felix behind
it, is surely a massive opportunity for
them to show to the next generation
of Sabbs that it is worth running for
these positions in the Big Elections
this year as you can actually make an
impact.
Yours,

Dear Sir,
I am somewhat bemused by the ap-
proximate costs for the proposed halls
in North Acton. As has correctly been
pointed out by the Student’s Union
(“he maximum annual maintenance
loan for London is £7675. 39 weeks at
Acton would be roughly £5900 – ex-
cluding travel costs.”), and consider-
ing the price of a Zones 1-2 Student
Travelcard is £848, thus bringing the
total cost of the hall to approximately
£7000, it raises the possibility that
those who are suﬃciently well oﬀ
enough to not qualify for the means
tested part of the maintenance loan
may be priced out of these halls.
Whilst I am aware that savvy stu-
dents could save money by purchas-
ing monthly travel cards, this does not
negate the fact that you either have
to be at the bottom end of the system
(and thus qualify for a 100% loan) or
have signiﬁcant funding from other
sources to aﬀord these new halls. As
I suspect the latter will no doubt ap-
ply for Southside and Eastside, and
the former may be tempted by Pem-
bridge Hall or (depending on cost af-
ter re-opening) Wilson House due to
the shorter commute, I can’t help but
wonder who Campus Services are tar-
geting the new hall of residence at.
Since all customers are either priced
out, have more ﬁnancially and logi-
cally favourable options, or can simply
aﬀord to pay more for better, it does
raise the prospect that the only sell-
ing point for this hall is ‘You Have No
Other Choice’. As this form of selling
seems somewhat strange, I would be
most interested if Campus Services
was able to enlighten us, maybe as a
letter here in Felix, as to who exactly
they predict will live in this hall, and
their reasons for it.
Yours,
A Bemused Reader
f a ﬁrst year lives in North
Acton, they are going to
spend at least 90 minutes a
day traveling back and forth
between South Kensing-
ton and their halls. As the courses at
Imperial College London are already
known to have a high workload, our
future students are going to ﬁnd this
incredibly painful and I expect more
first years will drop out when they
are going through the transition of
a school mentality to that of what is
needed to complete an Imperial de-
gree. I predict that these students
will engage less with the student
community, fewer will do Horizons,
which will ultimately lead to them not
being a well-rounded student and
less employable.
I also expect the lecture attendance
will drop signiﬁcantly for any ﬁrst
years that live in North Acton, for ex-
ample I doubt the lecture turnout on
Wednesday mornings is going to be as
high for those that are lucky enough
to live in South Kensington. his is
going to leave a gap in some students’
knowledge of their discipline and I am
worried more students may fail their
exams and get lower marks due to
this.
Furthermore, the students that are
living in South Kensington will be able
to access the 24-hour central library
at practically all hours with just a six
minute walk to Eastside, while stu-
dents will have to get 2 night buses
back to North Acton when the un-
derground stops running. It seems a
massive shame to me that less of our
students will be able to access one of
Imperial’s greatest resources, which
the students think most highly of.
I know the Union does not repre-
sent academic staﬀ but I really don’t
envy any of the undergraduate ad-
missions tutors who will have to sell
Imperial to prospective applicants, on
the fact that there is a good chance
they will have to pay around £6,500
on accommodation and travel, while
they receive a sub-standard student
experience. In the latest UCAS data,
the biggest reason for students declin-
ing an oﬀer was the cost of living. his
data doesn’t even take into account
the students who didn’t apply in the
ﬁrst place and I envisage that more ap-
plicable students won’t want to come
to Imperial due to this recent develop-
ment.
I mean, seriously what is the point
of paying members of College staﬀ in
Outreach and Recruitment, while tell-
ing the Oﬃce For Fair Access (OFFA)
that we are doing our part on widen-
ing participation, so we can charge
the £9,000 fees, if we just segregate
the cash rich students from the others
and deter talented applicants from ap-
plying, who just simply cannot aﬀord
it? How are we supposed to attract
the best talent from across the globe
if we can’t even manage it in our own
country?
So as you can see, I am clearly
#AgainstActon and I urge every stu-
dent reading this to let your academic
reps know that you are too.
We want your
thoughts.
