PISCES
This week you decide to
become a clown and go to
Clown College instead of Im-
perial. Your degree is definite-
ly easier, but having to get the
bus dressed as everyone’s
nightmare and constantly be-
ing pied in the face can get
a bit grating. You make a joke
out of it, but laughing just
feels like work now.
This week you are bored and
look up safe for work porn.
You find yourself strangely
aroused by it all. Eventually
you come to a shuddering
climax while staring at a pic-
ture of a girl pretending to DJ
her crotch. Everyone in the
computer room isn’t quite as
impressed though, plus you
made the keyboard sticky.
This week you get your ac-
commodation offer and
are forced off to Paragon.
Oh dear. Could be worse,
you could be in Acton. You
wake up to find out that you
were only dreaming. Drows-
ily, you jump out of bed and
ready yourself for the walk
from your house in... Acton.
Ahhhh man. That sucks.
This week you are just in
sight of the sweet release
of deadlines being over. No
more jacket potatoes, no
more masturbating in the Li-
brary (out of necessity, now
it’s just for fun), you’re free!
You feel like George Michael,
but without the inability to
sensibly drive. You get a j pot
for old time’s sake. Pint?
This week you put yourself
forward to be the new Pope.
Not sure of what to do you
look up the job description.
You learn Latin, put on robes,
and start having outdated
views on condoms. It turns
out you just stick out in lec-
tures, and your hat is getting
in the way of everyone see-
ing.
This week you have to de-
cide on the long term strat-
egy of something in College.
It gets tricky when you pick
something that immediately
make everyone so annoyed
that you get confused and
think you’re at UCL or some-
where where people give
a shit about stuff other than
work, food and sleep.
This week you try to start a
stand up comedy career as
a “mathemagician”. You get
booed off stage everywhere
and repeatedly heckled. Eve-
ryone thinking you’re weird
and annoying? Hmmmm, this
is what being in a nightclub
is usually like for you, but with
less awkward flirting. You have
no spray, and get no lay.
This week, you discover that
you are still eating fucking
horsemeat. This is just ab-
surd. Come on people, still.
You get pissed off and de-
cided that the only way out is
to go straight to source and
just murder a pony that you
see running free. A very posh
family are really annoyed with
you.
This week you meet Prince
Phillip. It’s a disappointment
when he doesn’t say some-
thing inappropriate to you. De-
void of all hope you decide to
go where souls die in silence:
the Library. Prince Phillip
steals your last textbook and
calls you a tosser. You can’t do
your APS, but at least some-
thing you wanted happened.
This week you go for a mas-
sive dump. As is your usual
habit, you wrap it up in a
tupperware box. Later on
you realise that all you have
left for dinner is some kind of
“beef” product. You decide
not to risk it and just chomp
on your own feces. The
sweetcorn are the only nug-
gets of flavour.
This week a black bar pisses
you off when it covers the rest
of your horo
This week you must decide
between eating a horse or
eating a horse. On the one
hand, a horse is really nice,
and you are pretty hungry.
On the other hand, you want
a lasagne, and, well, you
know the drill. Maybe a pony
might be more to your suit-
ing? What’s it going to be
then? Eh?
