Successful week for RAG
Raising and Giving (RAG), the char-
ity arm of Imperial College Union had
their annual RAG Week during 11-15
February. It was a week of fun ﬁlled
events that raise money for RAG’s
chosen charities. David Goldsmith,
RAG Chair, said “RAG took over Im-
perial.”
he thousands of pounds that have
been raised will go towards Interna-
tional development, breast cancer re-
search and Richard House children’s
hospice in Newham.
RAG kicked oﬀ with a Bungee jump
on the Queen’s Lawn, automatically
raising awareness about RAG so that
everyone knew what was happening.
Other events included a cartoon col-
lect, as Masquerade ball, a Secret Val-
entine service, and a RAG week raﬄe.
David Goldsmith commented, after
the Bungee jump “we then ensued to

passers-by by their ankles in search
of their spare change. We partied it
up Penthouse-style on Valentines Day
and guzzled on unlimited pizza on
the Friday. We generated inconceiv-
able levels of fun yet at the same time
we raised heaps of cash for those in
need. his is the true spirit of RAG. It
is a driving force that brings students
of Imperial together in order to do
something good whilst having a hell of
a great time doing it”
