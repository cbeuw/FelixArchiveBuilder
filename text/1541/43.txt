fter the smartphone
and table revolu-
tion, the next
big thing in
the tech world
seems to be wearable gadg-
ets. After the full saturation o f
these two markets, which are quite im-
portant for these kind of companies,
the technology giants are attempting
to claim this new area of the market.
Potential game changer, these could
completely revolutionise the way we
ing. his
product re-
ally came into
the public’s
view when product testing
began in April 2012. he glasses
were worn by the Sergey Brin, one
of the Co-Founders of Google, at
various public events as well as de-
moed with several extreme sports
athletes and broadcasted on Goog-
le+.
he internet is awash with ru-
mours that Apple, another big boy
on the tech company block, is now
also about to jump onto the wear-
able gadget ship with its iWatch.
he conspiracy theorists are having
a ﬁeld day with this one, wondering
if Apple themselves may be respon-
sible for the ‘leaks’. he iWatch has
been rumour since 2007 its been a
constant fallback for tech journal-
ists when news on Apple was rare.
However, now a days, the iWatch
may actually become reality. An
accessory to other iDevices more
than an actual gadget on its own,
its income is supposed to replace
the falling income of the iPod line.
here are many purported features
of the iWatch ranging from un-
locking your phone, to beeping if
you leave your connected iDevice
behind when you leave the house.
While a very interesting addition
to the Apple product line, I am
wondering if, apart from dedicated
fans, anyone will actually buy this.
What Apple can do, Samsung can
FRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY

A do, ac-
cording to android
lovers, better. Samsung
also apparently will be releasing
a smartwatch, the Altius. Rumours
of this product are scarce and it is
hard to ﬁnd any concrete facts on
what this gadget will do. Not even
the OS is assured, as Samsung could
opt for Android or even a self created
OS. However rumours quote that its
functions are said to be quite similar
to that of the iWatch.
However these are not the only
wearable gadgets on oﬀer. he Pebble
smartwatch started the whole watch
thing, while EyeTap is apparently very
similar to Google’s Project Glass.
his makes the prediction that this
future market space will be fought
over quite ﬁercely and that there will
be quite a lot of competition for each
company seem very credible.
However what does the consumer
want to see from this area of tech?
An ease of use and actually forgetting
that you are using any technology is
the central idea behind these kind of
gadgets. hus each new device must
be useful and have a clearly deﬁned
purpose that our gadgets today can-
not fulﬁl. hus, while I think the idea
of the smartwatch is quite cool, the
“smartglasses” just seem so much
more useful. he watches will just be
introducing another screen that I will
have to look at, while the glasses will
remove them, and actually use your
surroundings as their screen. How-
ever, you never know technology is a
ﬁckle ﬁeld. he cool ideas may
never work, and the
pointless ones may
actually ﬂour-
ish.

The News Bubble
General news from around the tech world, so you can keep up to date with the
newest, weirdest and most futuristic things around.
Drawing in 3D
For all you artsy people: a new $50 3D pen is looking for funding. It releases
melted plastic from the nib, which hardens within seconds. This allows you to
build up beautiful shapes at a much cheaper price than 3D printers.
Hacking Frenzy
PCs of Facebook Employees were hacked roughly a week ago, however no
data stolen. A few days ago Apple was targeted. Apparently all this cyber
attacks are originating from a building in Shanghai. Government paranoia,
fuelled by internet speculation has pointed the finger at the Chinese govern-
ment as the main Culprit.
Cheaper MacBooks
Apple has now finally left its high perch, and has reduced some of its laptops
to more affordable levels. This price drop is applied to some MacBook Pros
and the high end Macbook Air. However the prices, although lower, are still
somewhat ludicrous.
Phone for a Pretty Penny part 2
HTC has announced the HTC One, its attempt at dethroning the king of
Android smartphones the Galaxy 3. With an unibody aluminium case, and
several key features, including Blink Feed, the HTC Zoe camera and a great
sound system this actually seems like a great attempt by the failing Taiwanese
Manufacturer.

quite spartan, formed only of an alu-
