Hyde Park shows all a Relay good time
fter last week’s BUCS
Cross-Country in
Leeds, the running
hype continued with the
Hyde Park Relays 2013,
a competition held since 1949 and
gathering students from all over Eu-
rope. Imperial XC members had been
up all week to prepare for the event,
and were impatient to show the re-
sults of their winter training.
On D-day, after only a few hours
sleep for many due to last minute
preparations, the course was set up in
Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens,
our usual training playground. he
men’s route was about 5.2km, to be
run by six people (unless you’re Milan
Misak and want to wear 6 numbers
on your vest for a mere 31km jog –
hero!), while the women’s team had 4
laps of 3.5km to complete.
he men’s race got underway at
14:00 under pleasant weather for run-
ners, the rain having just stopped.
Women followed 5 minutes later, and
tourists could admire about 100 run-
ners doing their best to place their
team. Women came back ﬁrst to pass
to the next leg, while the next runners
were either warming up or cheering
compatriots in a friendly atmosphere.
On the men‘s side, despite tenta-
tives by Cambridge and St. Mary’s,
the ﬁrst leg was clearly dominated
by Imperial’s Chris Bannon, thanks
to a very intelligent acceleration after
staying behind in the ﬁrst windy part.
He even had time for the Michu cel-
ebration, snatching the fastest time of
the day in an impressive 15’42’’. his
left time to change vest and start his
second leg for Medics’ team, just a bit
slower this time!
Sadly the lead was lost a few kilo-
meters later with Chris homas un-
able to ﬁght oﬀ the machine-like St.
Mary’s team, while Cambridge and
Oxford came up to take 2nd and 3rd.
Fresher Liam Smith (who later ran
two supplementary legs for his hall
teams), third year Chris Charles and
Jean-Claude Besse followed, taking
the next three legs as fast as they pos-
sibly could to avoid the return of St.
Mary’s 2. Imperial was still in 4th be-
fore last leg, the exact position they
took in 2010 and 2011. Men’s Captain
James Ellis ﬁnally crosses the ﬁnish
line in 5th overall position, but satis-
ﬁed given the very high level of com-
petition this year. Congratulations to
the other IC XC teams who all ﬁn-
ished in the top half and particularily
to Milan Misak who completed all 6
legs himself!
In the women’s race, Imperial XC
had a record 4 teams in a ﬁeld of near-
ly 50 teams. It was up to recent ameri-
can import Melissa Newton-Mora to
start oﬀ the girls bid: improve on last
years 7th position. She did an impres-
sive job to ﬁnish in the main pack
along with Cambridge, Oxford, Bris-
tol and St Marys University in a time
of 12.39. Imogen Keane then stormed
out to try and retain our position fol-
lowed by Eileen Brandley, it was then
up to Sophie Kirk to lead the team
home after leaving her marshalling
post just 5 minutes prior it was always
going to be an interesting race. With
a cry of “Im going to get her” (Oxford
Brookes was in sight), the Captain
set oﬀ in hot pursuit. Having caught
Brookes at the bridge it was all about
the pb and holding oﬀ any further
teams. Oxford (the real one) were
too strong this time but the ﬁrst team
still ﬁnished in and incredible 6th
position, up one on last year! Other
great performances were by Harveen
Hayer, Kimberley Mason and Lauren
Stanley who are all new to the club!
Once marshalling and course taking
down jobs were complete (which in-
cluded jumping over fences in closed
parks, pushing a trolley all around
Hyde Park at dusk, and deciding
against carrying away a big “Metro-
politan Police – wet paint” sign as
well), we joined the team in the SCR
for (much needed) jacket potatoes
and the prize giving ceremony. St.
Mary’s took both men and women
external ﬁrst places, while both in-
ternal catergories were awarded to
Imperial Triathlon. Fastest legs were
Chris Bannon (ICXC, 15’42’’) and
Sophia Saller (Oxford, 12’04’’) in the
Women’s.
After a quick shower, Imperial
Cross Country Club ‘ran’ to the Union
and later Metric, for yet another night
of post race celebration. Competition
spirit took over some teams, who are
still disputing the victory in a boat
race and who actually participated...
(it will always be IC in our hearts)!
Freshers were also introduced to the
Hyde Park Relays Horn (the old boys
showed us how it was done), while
some had the privilege to take the DJ’s
spot in Metric. he job was not quite
ﬁnished at that point, since people
had been assigned to sleep over at the
Union to steward foreign runners, or
were in charge of having rooms clean
on time the next day. But who cares?
he music was on, facepaint for all
ICXC members, a good night worth
remembering (for those who can!).
To be short, compared to BUCS
last week, you can replace “painful
steps in the mud” by “ﬂying on the
road”, hilly by ﬂat, long journey by
a run home; whilst keeping the fun
and competitive level (of both racing
and partying!). And as a triathlete I
had images of the Brownlee brothers
rushing along the Serpentine during
last summer’s Olympics.
And ﬁnally, a huge thanks (certainly
from all satisﬁed 500+ runners) to
co-organisers Matt Douthwaite and
Ming Wang-Koh, hopefully we, the
ICXC team, did a good job to help
you out, but your organisation made
Hyde Park Relays 2013 an awesome
event which every runner at any level
within Imperial College just had to
join!
I would.
#YOLO!
It’s overly photogenic Vicki! Again.
