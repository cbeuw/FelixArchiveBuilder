FRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY

esearchers at Duke
University have given
lab rats the ability to
‘see’ infrared light, in
research published in
Nature Communications last week.
The story was reported widely as
the rats getting a ‘sixth sense’. The
term is an exaggeration, implying
some unexplained or paranormal
effect. But the reality is startling
enough.
The rats were fitted with an infra-
red sensor, which was wired up to an
implant in the region of their brain
that normally reacts to the sensation
of their whiskers brushing against
something.
Infrared (IR) light is part of the
electromagnetic spectrum that also
includes the visible light that we can
see, but its wavelength is longer, put-
ting it outside the range our eyes can
detect. Infrared perception by living
things is not entirely unknown, how-
ever — some bats and snakes have
been found to be able to ‘see’ IR light
— but it is rare, and certainly not the
case for rats (which the researchers
did double-check in a control exper-
iment with normal rats).
With the implants, the rats could
not only detect the presence of IR
light but could distinguish between
different frequencies, which could
be considered equivalent to seeing
in colour. In fact they learned to
navigate their way around using the
different infrared sources to guide
them.
One question remains unanswered
— and is a difficult one to answer as
the rats can’t report back on what
the experience was like. Given that
the electrodes were hooked up to
the whisker stimulation area of the
brain, did ‘seeing’ infrared light
from the rat’s point of view just feel
like touching something with their
whiskers? Or was it an entirely new
type of sensory experience?
Ethical considerations probably
rule out trying the technique on
a human volunteer (though who
wouldn’t be just a little bit curious
to find out what having a new sense
would be like?). So further research
is needed to establish exactly what is
going on in the rat’s brain.
The result raises some intriguing
possibilities for the future though.
So far the focus of such neurologi-
cal prosthetics has been on restor-
ing normal function where it has
been lost through injury or disease.
The best known example is coch-
lear implants for deafness. But what
if we could go a step further and
use this technology to actually give
people more abilities than any of us
naturally have? Super-humans may
someday be a possibility. But first,
we need a bit more work on the su-
per-rats.

Seeing red — or at least infrared.
Fish getting high
Philip Kent Science Editor
Does any of your medication get
washed away through the water sys-
tem? If so, your medication could lead
to aquatic life having a very exhilarat-
ing day indeed.
Research from Umeå University,
Sweden has shown how an “unusually
high” concentration of anti-anxiety
drug, Oxazepam, in a river in Sweden
has caused ﬁsh to exhibit a number of
strange changes to behaviour.
Whilst water puriﬁcation and treat-
ment systems are supposed to remove
contaminants such as drugs, many
have slipped past, leading to worry
that other drugs may be harming
aquatic life.
Fish take up the drug through the
tissues in their muscles, meaning that
they are incredibly sensitive to even
small concentrations of the drug.
he drugged ﬁsh appeared to leave
their protective shoal formation, pre-
ferring to swim individually. When the
concentration of drug was increased,
the ﬁsh went one step further and
travelled through to unknown places
far more willingly than their normal
counterparts.
Secondly, ﬁsh drugged to any con-
centration of oxazepam became far
more hungry, and more innovative in
ﬁnding their food.
It is not certain that oxazepam is the
sole cause of the erratic behaviour, or
whether circumstances are to blame,
concern has nonetheless been raised
as to the ecological eﬀects of washing
drugs out into the oceans. It is hoped
that this will again raise the argument
for regulation of aquatic pollutants.
