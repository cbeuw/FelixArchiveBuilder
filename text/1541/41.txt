FRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY

Felix Film favourites for the
Argo
Number of nominations: 7
Why it will win:
The surge behind this
outstanding thriller has been
astonishing, with the ﬁlm
nabbing the Golden Globe,
SAG, WGA, DGA, PGA and
even the surprise BAFTA wins.
It’s a tense, and ultimately feel-
good historical drama that, as
a bonus brownie point, paints
Hollywood as heroes in saving
American lives. Who doesn’t
appreciate a good pat on the
back? Its healthy box oice
intake is also looking good for
the ﬁlm’s overall popularity.
Why it won’t win:
Ben Affleck missed out on
the crucial Best Director
nomination, without which
the Best Picture award can
often be very diicult to win.
This kind of win hasn’t been
done since Driving Miss Daisy’s
win all the way back in 1990.
Beasts of the Southern Wild
Number of nominations: 4
Why it will win:
Debut director Benh Zeitlin
cheekily nabbed a Best
Director nomination (ahead of
Kathryn Bigelow, Ben Affleck,
Quentin Tarantino) for this
year’s race in his breakout
independent feature, with his
wonderfully magical, densely
packed and beautiful ﬁlm
creating quite the storm when
it ﬁrst debuted in Sundance,
winning rave reviews
and attention at various
international ﬁlm festivals.
Why it won’t win:
It’s too indie, and hasn’t been
winning enough during the
race. Again, here is a “be
grateful you even got the
nomination (even more so as
a debut)” type ﬁlm that gets
slotted in every year. And this
hasn’t made a lot of money,
which is never a good sign.
Django Unchained
Number of nominations: 5
Why it will win:
Now widely considered to
be Quentin Tarantino’s best
work since Pulp Fiction, and
the ﬁlm well on course to
become the director’s highest
grossing ﬁlm, it would surely
make sense to send some
more Oscar love his way. It
also tackles the ever important
theme of slavery, a great sore-
spot in American history, and
it’s packed with excellent
performances from the usual
Tarantino collaborators.
Why it won’t win:
No director nomination for
Tarantino will deﬁnitely hurt
the ﬁlm’s chances. Plus, is the
ﬁlmtooviolent?Tooeccentric?
Too lengthy? There are many
reasons to love Tarantino. But
the exact same reasons apply
to those who are not, and will
never be, his bigest fans.
Les Misérables
Number of nominations: 8
Why it will win:
It’s a large, sweeping, musical
adaptation of one of the
world’s favourite stage shows.
Aﬁlmthatbroughteveryoneto
tears (always a massive plus),
it’s full of rousing moments
backed by an emotionally
charged soundtrack.
Why it won’t win:
Again, no director nod for Tom
Hooper, which makes the win
challenging, and the many
bum notes the actors hit with
their live-singing they’re all
so proud of and can’t seem to
stop talking about, are bound
to act as a negative point. And
a lot of the ﬁlm’s hype seems to
be resting on the individual to
technical achievements from
various departments, as well
as Anne Hathaway’s startling
supporting turn. But not for
the ﬁlm as a whole.
Amour
Number of nominations: 5
Why it will win:
ThisPalmed’Orwinnerwasthe
arthouse favourite of last year,
with audiences warming to
its harshly honest, beautifully
woven tale of love. Michael
Haneke’s unique brilliance in
directorial style always goes
down well with viewers, and
its bittersweet look at end of
life not only amazed Europe,
but also the U.S.
Why it won’t win:
Foreign ﬁlms never win the
top prize. Ever. (Silent-ﬁlm The
Artist doesn’t count.) A big
win at Cannes means very little
when it comes to the actual
Oscar race. A nomination
in the traditionally English-
language category should be
enough of an honour. And
within the States, the ﬁlm
hasn’t been performing well at
all with picking up awards.
