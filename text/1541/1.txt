Students angrily denounce College plans for halls in North Acton
Union sets out five requests of College
Distance and price highlighted as main problems with the halls
Likely to be replacement to Evelyn Gardens
Probable closure of Garden hall

Imperial College London is planning
to build a large hall of residence in
North Acton that will potentially re-
place halls that are cheaper and locat-
ed far closer to the South Kensington
Campus. he North Acton Halls could
be used as a replacement for Garden
Halls and the halls in Evelyn Gardens,
both of which are in South Kensing-
ton. he plans have been controversial
amongst the student body and have al-
ready been denounced. Students have
highlighted distance, cost, student ex-
perience, and welfare concerns. he
Union have launched a campaigned
against the plans, using the Twitter
hashtag #AgainstActon. Already many
students have voiced their opposition
in a rare turn of student activism at
Imperial.
he College Council (who are the
highest decision making body of Im-
perial) publically announced on Mon-
day 18 February that it had decided to
authorise purchase of the land for the
new development, with building work
planned to begin in May 2013 and ﬁn-
ish before the start of the 2015-2016
academic year. he halls would be lo-
cated on 1 Victoria Road, Acton, W3
6BL, house 724 students, and will have
student facilities that are twice the size
of the JCR and SCR combined. To dis-
cover how far along the way the plans
are Felix contacted Simon Harding-
Roots, the Chief Operations Oﬃcer
of Imperial College London, who said
that the land has been bought and rel-
evant documents exchanged. At 10am
on Tuesday 19 February Imperial Col-
lege Union launched the campaign to
oppose the decision. he Union have
now delivered a response to College,
which was passed unanimously by
Union Council (see page 5), and have
started putting up posters around
campus.
During the meetings discussing the
plans, Paul Beaumont, Union Presi-
dent, actively opposed the plans. He
told Felix: “We [the Union] believe
we’ve already won the quantitative ar-
gument against College Management
with our analysis of the proposed pric-
es and student accommodation sur-
vey data; all we now need is the help
of students to assure the qualitative
data”. His concerns and analysis seem
to have not been taken on board. he
Union appear to not be the only ones
who are not entirely satisﬁed. Michael
Bluck, Chairman of the Wardens
Committee indicated the Wardens’
worry. He said that the “Committee
expressed its concern, given that very
recent experience of UG accommoda-
tion in similar sites had been negative,
largely on the grounds of travel time
and separation from the support and
social provisions based at the SK cam-
pus”.
he North Acton halls will be two
minutes away from North Acton tube
station in a well lit area, with
