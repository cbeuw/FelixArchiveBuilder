Lifting the Barriers
What does a trade agreement between the two largest economies in the world mean?
Spring seems to be in the air. he
feeling of change and new prospects
seem to blossom. For 2013 marks the
beginning of free trade negotiations
between the EU and the US.
So why should you care? Free trade
agreements are about removing
barriers between nations. Quotas,
which limit the amount of imported
goods, and tariﬀs, which serve as an
import tax, are set in place to beneﬁt
local manufacturers and businesses.
Imported goods are inﬂated in price,
giving the consumer incentive to buy
local.
While these protectionist measures
keep local unemployment down,
trade barriers do more harm than
good, especially for the consumer. In
a free market system the lowest priced
goods are the ones that win out. his
either destroys the competition or
causes them to change their game and
adapt to the situation at hand.
he late Soviet Union serves as a
rather extreme example of the evils
of protectionism. After its economic
boom in the 50s, centralized planning
and resource managing meant that
there was no incentive for industries
to modernize. Extreme limits on
imported goods meant there was no
tangible competition. As a result of
this and other factors the economic
stagnation of the 70s and 80s became
a harsh reality.
As the example of the Soviet Union
illustrates, protectionist measures
do provide for some short-term
gains, but as a long term economic
policy they only serve to handicap.
Only direct competition could
allow for continuous modernization
and relevance in a global trade
environment.
his is why you should care. he
EU and the US represent the largest
economies of the world. he two
represent nearly half of the world’s
GDP and 800 million people.
Negotiations could come linking
European ties with NAFTA (North
American Free Trade Agreement), an
agreement between Canada, the US
and Mexico. If such an agreement was
settled, the economic beneﬁt would
be enormous. A research institute in
Munich found that if a comprehensive
agreement is reached then living
standards in both the US and the EU
could rise by more than 5% by 2030.
Trans-Atlantic trading could treble.
his would also include standardizing
safety rules, competition laws and
technical procedures.
But money isn’t everything.
he negotiations could be serving
a political purpose as well. his
potential union would serve as a
counterweight of the rising inﬂuence
of ACTFA (ASEAN-China Free Trade
Agreement), which links Southeast
Asian economies to China’s growing
clout.
But not all are convinced. Some
view the negotiations as too good to
be true. here is already the usual
muttering of losing jobs in both the
US and the EU. his talk will get
louder as the negotiations get closer
to fruition. However, unemployment
concerns have always ﬁgured into free
trade talks. he long-term realities of
an agreement are simply that more
jobs are created than lost.
he more troubling concern for
these negotiations comes from
the side of the EU. Ratifying any
agreement of such calibre will most
likely require every country’s approval.
For export driven economies, such as
Germany, the target will be a broad
and comprehensive agreement. he
real sticking point could turn out to
be France and southern countries,
especially in terms of regulating
agriculture. American agricultural
output is massive in comparison to
southern Europe. Cheap, US goods
threaten the livelihood of southern
European farmers. Health and safety
laws diﬀer as well: the spectre of
GM foods will likely rear its head in
discussions.
he other complication lies with
the US. If negotiations stall for longer
than two years, a comprehensive EU-
US trade agreement will be a hard sell
for Obama. He might then turn his
Riding through Europe
he horse meat scandal is revealing
the intricacies and complexities of the
European food industry. When discon-
certing discoveries were made in Ire-
land in November 2012 and ﬁnally the
scandal erupted in the UK mid-January,
no one expected it to blow up in such
a dramatic way. Since then, three sepa-
rate supply chains, 13 countries and 28
companies have become involved in
one of the largest food crises since BSE.
he scandal looks like it might even
take an international turn, with prod-
ucts being removed from supermarkets
in Hong Kong.
he ﬁnger pointing dance has begun.
Suppliers in Romania are being accused
by French companies of mislabelling
their meat. Following the discovery of
horse meat in school meals, the UK
government and FSA are at a loss. 2,501
DNA tests were run by a watchdog and

whether the government was warned
about this two years ago. Financial
pressures on the food industry to drive
pricesdown,theimpactoftheeconomic
crisis leading to horse owners sending
their animals to slaughterhouses and
selling the meat are all factors leading
to the inﬂux of horsemeat into the food
chain. Ties between meat laundering,
various traﬃcking operations and local
maﬁa have also been uncovered in the
fraudulent supply chains. Needless to
say, this does not justify the scandal
taking place, more so it begs the
question of regulation.
he Food Standards Agency (FSA)
does not have much power. Reduced
budgets and attempts to make the
industry self-regulating means that
standards are enforced by strained
local authorities and the companies
themselves.
European regulation only requires
the distributors to know the origin
of their product. Traceability here is
not the issue, solely labelling. With
products labelled as beef containing up
to 100% horse meat and pig meat, there
is a clear need to guarantee the veracity
of the label displayed on supermarket
shelves. With the guilty supply chains
spanning up to ﬁve countries, it makes
sense for regulation to be at a European
level.
Calls for a form of European food
standards and regulating agency have
grown louder in the midst of the
scandal. his would be complicated
to put in place as all 27 countries will
have to ratify the set of rules, and
then again unanimously agree on any
changes to come in the future. Even
if an organisation were successfully
created, it could rapidly be deadlocked
into bureaucracy and negotiations.
Integration is needed for such a body to
function, a diﬃcult decision for Europe
and a choice the Coalition government
is unlikely to make.

As it stands to reason, an EU-US
free trade agreement seems somewhat
utopic. Even with a target date of 2015.
Here’s to hoping it won’t get bogged
down in negotiations.
