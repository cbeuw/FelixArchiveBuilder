Action Against Acton
hat’s the point
of widening par-
ticipation and
encouraging the
brightest minds
to apply to Imperial – if they’re then
not going to be able to aﬀord to come.
Or worse, can *just* aﬀord to come but
get placed in a hall in North Acton?
For the last six months, I and the
Deputy President (Welfare), Becky
have been arguing against the North
Acton development that will probably
replace Evelyn Gardens – and now, the
probable closure of Garden Hall too.
College has listened, and even, I’d go
as far to say, accepts that North Acton
isn’t a good plan – it’s an insurance plan
in case something better doesn’t come
along. What worries me is that they’ll
now stop looking for alternatives.
What makes me think that? he Col-
lege’s news article on the subject tries
to sell the project as something posi-
tive for students. I’ve provided a short
dissection of the news, from my – and,
now, thanks to the Executive Commit-
tee’s response – the Union’s point of
view.

lege website:

“Plans include a stu-
dent lounge and coﬀee
shop, restaurant and
bar, gymnasium, newsa-
gent and print shop, cinema room
and study centre, as well as facilities
that could be used by Imperial College
Union.
”
his almost sounds as though the
Union was complicit in the plans; I was
thoroughly against them. Coﬀee shops,
restaurants, print shop, newsagent and
bars (all run by College) are duplicat-
ing services normally found on campus
and just extorting more money from
students. Eastside 2.0. On the ﬂip side,
inclusion of these service at least shows
that College is aware that the hall is too
far away for South Kensington to be
useful for students…
“Simon Harding-Roots, Chief Opera-
tions Oﬃcer at Imperial College, said:
“he quality and design of this develop-
ment will be outstanding. It presents
a great opportunity to provide a large
portion of the College’s accommodation
requirement, delivering excellent value
W
The College’s plans for undergraduate accommodation in North
Acton are ill-thought-out and must be opposed
for money and af-
fordable rents for
our students.
””
When consider-
ing the travel cost,
this is more than
students are willing to
pay. his development is going to be
more expensive than Evelyn Gardens
and Garden Hall. he number one rea-
son why people don’t accept an oﬀer
from Imperial is the cost. How is this
aﬀordable?!
“Student feedback acquired during
the development of the College’s under-
graduate accommodation strategy has
been used in the selection and planning
of W3…
”
No it hasn’t. he Accommodation
Survey data was clearly ignored. hat
they’re building a bar, more than 30
minutes away from campus, and for
(when including travel costs) at £165pw
- £15pw more than students were really
looking to pay – shows exactly the op-
posite. Also, if I still count as a student,
then my feedback was listened to but
not used in the selection at all…
“…including suggestions that at least
400 bed spaces per hall are needed to
constitute a community…
”
Unless Commercial/Campus servic-
es are withholding data, this didn’t ap-
pear in the Accommodation Survey re-
sults at all that the Union received. his
justiﬁcation is just being used to close
Garden Hall. he 7 halls next door to it
don’t count as a community I guess…
“he travel time by tube to the South
Kensington Campus is around 30 min-
utes and to Imperial West is around 10
minutes.
”
‘Around 30 minutes’ is actually 35+.
hat it’s 10 minutes to Imperial West
is wonderful, for the zero postgrads
who will be living in this hall (Imperi-
al West is a postgraduate only campus
and W3 is an undergraduate only hall).
“he addition of these new halls of
residence to the College’s undergradu-
ate accommodation portfolio will mean
that almost 60% of the current planned
bed spaces will fall within the lowest
rent band, currently £115 - £150 per
week – a price range students identiﬁed
as optimum in their feedback.
”
60%? College Council was told all
the single rooms would be £146pw at
today’s prices. What about the others?
What isn’t College telling us? Also, the
‘lowest rent band’ means nothing: Here
are some bands: £115-£150, £151-£152,
£153-£154, £154-£155. College can set
the bands at whatever it pleases…
““his project will create a dynamic
student hub,
” Mr Harding-Roots added.
“As well as ensuring we are meeting the
needs of our students””
his brings me back to my initial
question. What is the point of an Ac-
cess agreement encouraging students
to apply, irrespective of their back-
ground? Projects like this undo all the
work of the Admissions Tutors and
College Outreach who try and further
the College’s academic mission of at-
tracting the brightest students. Widen-
ing access is achieved through bricks
and mortar – realistically priced ac-
commodation – not shuﬄing paper
documents from QAA to OFFA and
back again. UCAS information shows
that the number one reason, by a mile,
that students who have been accepted
turn down Imperial is living costs.
