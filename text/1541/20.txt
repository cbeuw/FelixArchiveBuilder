My Paragon Nightmare
was fully prepared for the dif-
ﬁculty of the ﬁrst year. I was
prepared for the step up in
terms of work and diﬃculty
of the course. I was prepared
for the task of ﬁnding new friends all
over again. I was even prepared to live
alone and take care of myself. I was
not however, prepared to ﬁnd myself
alienated from a lot of other ‘fresh-
ers’ by being shoved into Paragon.
All the other diﬃculties of a ﬁrst year
are just common ground; everyone is
in the same boat. For the students at
Paragon, being there meant being in
a completely diﬀerent boat altogether.
he location is the obvious main
problem with the halls. Every morn-
ing, I wake up two hours before my
ﬁrst lecture, just to have enough time
to get ready and take the 40 or so min-
ute journey into South Kensington.
While no changes are necessary, it is
far from a comfortable journey. Being
the ‘Heathrow’ tube, it is often ﬁlled
with tourists with inﬁnite amounts
of luggage, and coming from the pe-
riphary of London, it is the prime tube
for many commuters. If you throw in
the fact that we have to make the jour-
ney during rush hour, it all adds up to a
cramped and uncomfortable journey,
with a seat being nothing less than a
miracle. In all honesty, after a term
of these terrible mornings, I’ve sadly
grown used to them. Near the begin-
ning of the year the journey always felt
like it was over an hour, excruciatingly
long. Now , however, I don’t notice the
40 minute journey, all I notice is the
diﬃculty of getting out of bed so early,
especially knowing that several of my
classmates in ‘regular’ halls get up 15
minutes before a lecture and casually
stroll in. he only thing worse than the
travel in the morning, is the travel back
in the evening. If I ﬁnish at 5 or 6, I get
caught in the rush hour, and as a re-
sult end up holding my breath for the
next 40 minutes so I’m not crushed by
the surrounding commuters, or their
luggage. Whereas some students go
back to their room between lectures
or for lunch, we cannot even consider
something like this. If you include the
walking either side, there and back
takes up two hours of your day. It’s a
highly alienating feeling, knowing that
very few of your classmates have the
same problems you do. Besides the
vast inconvenience of the journey, the
price of travel is extortionate. Our stu-
dent loans obviously do not take this
into account, so while I was prepared
to live on a student budget, I was not
prepared to also throw in £117 per
month for Zone 1-4 travel (some peo-
ple pay £90 for zone 1-3, or less for
zone 1-2, although this is far more
inconvenient). Budgeting becomes a
whole new beast as you can’t let your-
self go skint and live on cheap noo-
dles, you have to have enough to travel
to your lectures. It stretches even fur-
ther for nights out, surely the most
exciting prospect of being a student.
Should we want to go out, we either
have to go out in the surrounding area
(Brentford and Ealing) which, at best,
seem sad and nothing like the London
most of us dreamed about living in,
or we make the tube journey (at least
40 minutes, more for central London
and other popular places), which usu-
ally makes ‘predrinks’ redundant.
hroughout the entire night I ﬁnd my-
self looking at my watch and thinking
“should probably go home soon.” his
is simply because the only way to get
home after the tube stops running is
a night bus, which is at least an hour
and a half, and requires pre-planning,
due to the fact that it only runs from
certain stops (once you’ve had a drink
or two, Googling the way becomes far
harder). his challenge has crushed
my desire to go out and party: it’s just
too much hassle every time. Surely no
other fresher faces this problem. he
surrounding area of Paragon (Brent-
ford) is very dreary and depressing.
he only upside is how close the cor-
ner shop is, at it is pretty much outside
the Paragon gate. Looking at the area,
it feels nothing like London and not
somewhere one wants to live. It hous-
es a small industrial park and a small
and depressing high street.
he long journey begins to seem all
the more pointless when on some days
you only have 1 or 2 lectures (worse
still when you have a large gap be-
tween them). Finding the motivation
to go in in these situations becomes
harder and harder the longer into the
term you are, as a result work suﬀers,
probably the worst side eﬀect of im-
perial choice of Paragon. his is also
a problem on regular days, as after a
long day of lectures and travel, you
usually have no energy for revision or
problem sheets, let alone coursework.
he halls themselves are quite mod-
ern, more so than many halls at other
London universities and other halls
at Imperial (forgetting Eastside and
Southside). Every ﬂat has a large com-
munal kitchen (shared by 8) and each
room has its own en-suite. While an
en-suite is a great luxury, it’s dimin-
ished by the fact that we have the
worst showers possible. hey spray in
a wide arc that goes around you, forc-
ing you to either dance around to get
hit by water or use some DIY skills and
attach half a bottle to the shower head.
he rooms themselves are equipped
with everything you could need, but
also come with a bed which is both
shorter and narrower than a standard
single bed. Some of the taller students
have mentioned that at night, they
have to sleep curled up almost into a
ball. We have a decently sized laundry
room, but not large enough consider-
ing the sheer number of students from
the other universities at the hall (UWL
mainly). he common room is a sepa-
rate building shared by all of the dif-
ferent blocks of Paragon, and is very
poorly equipped. here are two pool
tables, which more often than not
have the balls stolen, a broken televi-
sion and more light and open space
than anyone can ﬁnd a use for. he
few attempts that have been made to
utilize this space for parties have been
nothing short of depressing.
he ﬂat structure has its own prob-
lem. Every ﬂat has a door which can
only be unlocked by an occupant of
that ﬂat. Whereas in another hall you
could wander up a ﬂoor to see your
friends there, we must ﬁrst bang on
the ﬂat door hoping and praying our
friends will hear us. his structure
serves to just further the feeling of iso-
lation: not only are we isolated from
the rest of imperial, we’re isolated
from each other as well.
One thing I must commend though,
is the eﬀort by our wardening team
(perhaps not our Head Warden),
who have done what little they can
to make this place more comfortable
for us, and more social. heir ongo-
ing eﬀorts are, and always will be ap-
preciated.
A Paragon of
