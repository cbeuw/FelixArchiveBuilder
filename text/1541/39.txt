Well let’s face it – the chances of the
ﬁfth movie in ANY ﬁlm franchise be-
ing spectacular were slim. But when
Die Hard 4.0 (aka Live Free or Die
Hard) was a bit rubbish, this one was
bound to be equally shoddy. Which it
was.
After the ﬁrst three Die Hard ﬁlms
tied up the loose ends of a good tril-
ogy pretty damn tightly, why anyone
though the fourth ﬁlm was a good
idea is beyond me, let alone the ﬁfth.
Clearly a classic case of making sure
the premise is squeezed for as much
cash as possible – plus, of course, a
chance for old Bruce to stretch his
legs.
In all fairness, director John Moore
does his best, despite his back cata-
logue being a list of remakes such
as he Omen and game adaptations
like Max Payne. here is a small im-
provement on the messy Die Hard
4.0; Moore does have the edge on Len
Wiseman, and the CGI eﬀects and
stunts are a bit neater. However, tak-
ing the story outside of the USA was
not a good idea, and hasn’t done the
ﬁlmmakers any favours. Russia is a bit
old school for this type of ﬁlm, really.
Randomly placing jokes associ-
ated with the Cold War just aren’t
clear to everyone and raise less than
a few titters from the audience. Mc-
Clane’s enthusiasm for going abroad
to ‘kill all the scumbags’ seems a lit-
tle too much, and loses the charac-
ter any last shreds of respect he was
clinging to – not to mention the fact
that, when he gets abroad, he is not
quite sure who the ‘scumbags’ are.
he chases through a snow-covered
Moscow are like a poor attempt at
an American James Bond, and the
somewhat drawn out climax is lit-
tered with clichés of helicopters and
disinterested gunﬁght.
Considering the poor sod is going
through the same pile of crap for the
ﬁfth time, Bruce Willis is, I guess,
still quite enthusiastic. Much more
than I would be his situation, that’s
for sure. But that doesn’t make up for
the mess made of the well thought out
system that made the ﬁrst three ﬁlms
work: for a successful Die Hard, you
need a hero (McClane, obviously), a
family member in danger, a bad guy
and a sidekick. In this ﬁfth Die Hard,
this pattern has been messed up.
he family member and the sidekick
have been combined into one whiny
irritating character – McClane’s se-
cret agent son – who intersperses
the breaks between plot twists and
gun ﬁghts with annoying father-son
bonding.
he best part of Die Hard was al-
ways the key relationship between
trigger-happy McClane and a tech-
savvy, hugely intelligent evil master-
mind. his was already buggered up
in Die Hard 4.0, but it was made even
worse in this latest ﬁlm – the bad
guys are now Russians we barely see,
and hence can’t work up that much
anger towards. Another let down is
that any ﬁnal ditch attempt at excite-
ment brought on by violence has been
well and truly doused in order to be
sure of that 12A rating.
Frankly, I really wouldn’t bother.

While the hype is slowly building for
the conﬁrmed Jurassic Park 4 movie,
audiences worldwide are trying to
contain themselves, and hoping for
another classic gem. However, pro-
ducer Frank Marshall conﬁrmed that
Kathleen Kennedy – his co-producer
for the last three Jurassic ﬁlms – will
not be involved in the project, owing to
her commitment to the new Star Wars
movie that is due from Disney. A fan
had asked Marshall on Twitter about
the extent of Kennedy’s involvement,
he wittily tweeted: “No, Ms. Kennedy
has moved onto Star Wars and will not
be producing JP4. She’s traded raptors
for TIE ﬁghters.”
At the moment, there has been very
little oﬃcial information leaked about
Jurassic Park 4; the cast, plot and ﬁlm-
ing location all remain ﬁrmly under
With the 85th Academy Awards cer-
emony a mere two days away, the
sprint to the ﬁnish line is one of the
closest ever this year. Out in front
is Argo, whose supremely talented
scriptwriter Chris Terrio pipped Lin-
coln’s Tony Kushner, Life of Pi’s David
Magee and Silver Linings Playbook’s
David O. Russell to the post to scoop
the prestigious Best Adapted Screen-
play award from the Writers’ Guild of
America this week – with that line-
up representing the majority of the
frontrunners for the Oscars this year.
Also coming up to the front is
Zero Dark hirty, whose writer Mark
Boal beat John Gatins (Flight) and
Paul homas Anderson (he Mas-
ter) alongside other top class writers
to bag the Best Original Screenplay
award. his news was surely very
welcome for the team behind the Bin
Laden hunt thriller, as the controver-
sy surrounding the movie was initial-
ly looking as though it might damage
its chances of winning the big time
awards. In his acceptance speech, a
clearly delighted Boal praised Zero
Dark hirty’s director, saying: “You
took this script, and you made it live
and breathe and ﬂy, and you led all
of us unﬂinchingly and bravely to a
place of truth and beauty.”

Oscar race heats up
The return of the dinosaurs
A dead cert for a bet would be the
Best Documentary prize: this award
must surely be going to Malik Bend-
ejelloul’s Searching for Sugar Man.
he ﬁlm’s ever-increasing popularity,
its success at the BAFTAs and its Best
Documentary WGA award are look-
ing to set it in good stead for the top
documentary prize at the Oscars.
On the same evening as the WGA
awards, the Golden Reel awards
were bestowed by the Motion Pic-
ture Sound Editors. While Ang Lee’s
Life of Pi cleaned up nicely, taking
the accolade of Best Sound Editing
of Dialogue and ADR as well as Best
Sound Editing of Music in a Feature
Film, hot on its heels was the hugely
popular Les Miserables – which, not
surprisingly, won the award for Best
Sound Editing of Music in a Musi-
cal. Latest Bond ﬁlm Skyfall took
the award for Best Sound Eﬀects and
Foley, while Pixar’s Wreck-It Ralph
did well, scooping Best Sound Ef-
fects, Foley, Dialogue and ADR in an
Animation.
With no more awards to be handed
out before Sunday’s ceremony, we
now have as clear a picture as we’re
going to of the forerunners and the
top contenders. So place your bets –
but it’s anyone’s race.
wraps. As far as we are aware, no di-
rector has been chosen and the script
is still being tweaked. It does seem a
little optimistic that a release date of
June 13th 2014 has been settled – a
case of so much to do and so little time
– and there is much speculation that,
with nobody ﬁrmly at the helm, this
date is most likely a little ﬂimsy.
hat being said, the project is
planned to progress steadily as we
head towards March, with anticipa-
tion building from the public. Jurassic
Park will be re-released in IMAX 3D
in April 2013 – and is obviously going
to stir up a lot of excitement for the up-
coming fourth ﬁlm.
In the meantime, we shall leave you
with this picture to whet your appe-
tites… http://memebase.cheezburger.
