The rules take up precious space, but it’s bad form not to include them: draw a sin-
gle closed loop by vertically and horizontally joining the dots so that the numbered
squares are surrounded by the corresponding number of lines.
Hashi Connect all the is-
lands with bridges
so that you can get
from any island to any
other one. There are
restrictions, though:
the bridges have to be
either vertical or hori-
zonal and they must
not intersect. You can
have up to two bridg-
es between any two
islands and, last but
not least, each island
must have exactly as
many bridges stem-
ming from it as the
number on it.

Fill the cells with a
continuous line (the
“snake”) that does not
pass through a cell
twice, doesn’t intersect
with itself, and passes
through all white boxes
(but no black boxes).
The numbers show you
how many times the
snake turns in the cor-
responding row or col-
umn. The snake enters
and exits the grid at the
shown points (and only
those points). There’s a
hint to get you started.
