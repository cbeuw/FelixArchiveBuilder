Asbestos has
been found in
Skempton
here is fear in the College Council
that the contractor, ISG, who have the
£39 million construction contract for
the accommodation blocks at the new
White City campus, may not be hit-
ting their “target completion date”.
According to the September 2012
meeting minutes the venture was
originally to end in September 2013,
however an agreement was made to
give accommodation to some students
early. ISG therefore had a target com-
petition date for the end of August
2013, a date that now looks overly am-
bitious.
he College Council deemed the
current timings “extremely tight” and
have therefore asked that the situation
be “closely monitored”.

Recently released College Council
minutes from last September have
revealed the discovery of asbestos in
the Skempton Building. he material,
which is no longer used in construc-
tion, is highly toxic and leads to a
range of respiratory illnesses.
he asbestos was found in the duct-
work to Lecture theatre 2, which has
now been “capped oﬀ” in order to
safely deal with the situation. he Col-
lege already has an Asbestos Manage-
ment Plan in place for these situations
to reduce any risk associated with as-
bestos.
he substance was found during
the on-going works taking place in
Skempton and its ﬁnding has led to
delays with the refurbishment plans.
he minutes state that the operation
to remove the asbestos will take 8
weeks over either Easter or Summer.
