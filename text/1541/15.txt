FRIDAY 22 FEBRUARY
The Gate to an Imperial success story
Pedro Pereira interviews a founder of tech startup ‘GateMe’
xams… Library, presenta-
tions… Library, course-
work... Library. Being an
Imperial College student
is usually associated with
the “nerdiness” stigma. If you weren’t
already one when you got in, the gen-
eral idea is that by the time you leave,
you will have become a super studying
sleepless monkey.
While some of us see the above
idea as a math fact, others disagree
completely. Andre Nakkurt, Imperial
alumni and one of the founding part-
ners of GateMe, an innovative guest
management platform, was probably
one of the latter ones. he idea of a
“dark” secret world lurking far from
the old Library isles and cold labora-
tory workbenches must have attracted
him, either that or being sick of wait-
ing in queues to get in his favourite
nightclub. We decided to investigate!
PP: You say that GateMe is “innova-
tive”
, can you tell us what is so inno-
vative about it?
AN: GateMe helps clubs turn random
guests into regular clubbers, which
increases their bottom line. We do
this using state of the art technology,
which helps nightclubs understand
the clubbers in detail. Since day one,
the clubbing industry has been using
pen and paper to manage table book-
ings and guest lists. All these messy
papers contain data, which can’t be
used because processing costs are too
high. In comparison, GateMe runs
on any mobile device or tablet, which
makes it easy to use the data. Fortu-
nately for us, the industry is catching
onto this very fast.
PP: Does it explore a new business
market? Is it disrupting an old one?
AN: It’s all about execution and long
term vision at this point; disrupting an
old market and creating a new one is a
long journey and the team is enjoying
it so far. here will always be imitators
and we’re ﬂattered by their compli-
ments.
PP: Sounds good! So who are the
faces behind GateMe? Is it only
Imperial alumni? Do you need to
be extravagant and cool to work in
a start-up? Do you really wear flip
flops and drink Red Bull all day?
AN: GateMe considers itself lucky,
because the team has extremely good
rapport. hree team members are
brothers and four have known each
other since primary school. We have
attracted similarly passionate and reli-
able people, who have helped us de-
velop high quality software very fast.
he team enjoys a varied background
from PwC consulting to Google and
indeed, our developers are known to
enjoy the freedom of ﬂip ﬂops!
PP: When was the officially launch
and how did you celebrate?
AN: We had been working on our
prototype for a couple of months
and were often visiting clubs to get
feedback; at one point the positive
feedback started to drown out the
negative and we knew we were onto
something. he team was pleased af-
ter landing the ﬁrst paying customers
and excitement grew with expansion
from Estonia to London and Miami.
Every new paying customer warrants
a ring from our “happy customer” bell
(we actually have a bell in the oﬃce
solely for that occasion. True story).
However, the team feels that “the
Eureka!” moment is yet to come; it will
happen after we cause a major disrup-
tion in the industry and we’re working
tirelessly towards that.”
PP: Is it true that all start-ups have
offices with grass rugs and dogs
walking around?
AN: Very recently we had the honour
of winning Seedcamp London and be-
ing chosen among the one percent of
companies, who get world-class men-
toring and support from the prestig-
ious seed investment fund. An impor-
tant part of that support comes in the
form of shared oﬃce space at Google
Campus, London. Seedcamp is best
described as one large family of young
and ambitious overachievers, in the
best sense of that word. he shared
oﬃce is fantastic, because we can
bounce ideas around the room and
learn from their experience.
PP: What about future strategy?
Where do you see GateMe in 3 years
time?
AN: We’re currently focused on soft-
ware for nightclubs and the natural
progression from there is towards the
clubbers. he team works around the
clock to become the go-to brand for
nightlife.
PP: Being Imperial alumni, will you
ever come back? Did Imperial Col-
lege Business School help you at all?
AN: It’s kind of given that the academ-
ic side at Imperial College Business
School is outstanding, but my big-
gest surprise was the strength of in-
ternal and external events happening
throughout the year. I exhausted my-
self trying to absorb as much as pos-
sible from these fantastic events and
this has already paid oﬀ. Fortunately,
Imperial College Business School
beneﬁts from a very active start-up
community; places like IC Start-up
and Imperial Entrepreneurs are where
it’s really happening.
he experience far exceeded my ex-
pectations and I will remain very close
with Imperial. I look forward to giving
something back and fortunately I have
the chance in a couple of weeks. As
part of a panel for the Business Plan
Competition, I expect to see some
interesting ideas from the current
students. his was a major part of my
programme, which prepared me for
the challenges our team faced with
GateMe later on.
So next time you ﬁnd yourself wait-
ing in a 100 meter club queue, think-
ing why you didn’t book a table or
joint the guestlist that afternoon,
think about Andre and “his” GateMe.
Smile, call it ﬁeld research and you
just might be a step closer of becom-
ing a serial entrepreneur!
GateMe is available in all major
phone/tablet app markets, but if
you are interested in knowing more
about or you think you’ve got the
skillz it takes to be part of this amaz-
ing team, drop by www.gateme.com

an email.

Name not on the
