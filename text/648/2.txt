No News Editor
is Good News
Dear Martin
Congratulations on yet an-
other wonderful front page last
week; the headlines were as
usual witty, controversial, wildly
exaggerated and almost totally
irrelevant to any news that
followed, but highly artistic.
What a shame that all this small
text has to be included; you
could dispense entirely with it
and have the front page made up
solely of headlines consisting of
random permutation of the
words Slam, Fume, Louts,
Profs, Snubbed, Ripped Off,
Flashed and so on ad nauseum.
On the subject of creative
•journalism, several people have
complained about last week's
story, so tastefully titled 'Exam
Students disrupt Window Clean-
ers'. These tiresome and narrow-
minded people, incapable of
seeing FELIX as a Work of Art
which will contribute to an
exciting portfolio for prospective
employers, insist on quibbling
over such trivialities as window-
cleaners reportedly interrupting
final exams on a Bank Holiday
Monday. They must be made to
see that we are considering not
window-cleaners but the con-
cept of Window-Cleaners, which
goes to make up witty, contro-
versial, etc headlines. This is
particularly important in the
case of Chemistry Lecture
Theatre B, which has no win-
dows.
My apologies to Brian Stevens
and Jim Boucher (who was, as
reported in an earlier issue, in
Holland last week) and thanks
to Jon 'my accent's slipping'
Barnett.
Yours spherically
