STOIC
G'day and welcome to the last week of STOIC
broadcasts this year. This week we will
mention absolutely nothing about examina-
tions; we will not be asking whether the
Conservatives will introduce a workers cull or
reintroduce the death penalty for people who
walk behind the bowler's arm in cricket. We
will though, be poking another edition of 'Turn
it on again' between the (don't say that
word!) on Thursday. This is your last
chance

Out in the darkness the B-52 stood with the
elastic bomb in its belly—pregnant with death.
One of the ground crew, dwarfed beneath the
bomber, lit a cigarette, patted the huge nose
wheel and said,
'She's pregnant with death, this one.'
'So's the wife,' the companion answered and
spat on the tar-mac in a gesture of defiance to
the world.
Little did they notice the peculiar shape that
darted from across the runway to the yawning
bomb loading bay. Tentacle-like limbs grasped
the cold metal and as silently as if had appeared,
the rod-like shape disappeared into the plane.
Don't miss the last thrilling episode of The
Ultimate Elastic in the next issue of FELIX.
