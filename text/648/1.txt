NO BALLS!
The tradition of a Royal College
of Science Union Country'House
Ball at Silwood Park will not
continue next year. This is the
result of many years' abuse of the
facilities which culminated this
year.
The main complaints this year
were damage to the library table
and the state of the floors which,
according to Prof Way, the
Director of Silwood Park, will
take months to rectify. The
library table was badly stained
by red wine and hot water and
this was after RCS President-
elect Eric Derbyshire had been
told not to use the library for
anything but a cloakroom.
Damage was also caused to
the front lawn when one of the
coaches drove across it. This has
particularly annoyed the resi-
dencts since the lawn is held in
great esteem at Silwood.
This was in addition to
allegations that the place was
not cleaned properly. It was
because of this that the Silwood
residents complained to the
warden and as a consequence
Prof Way informed former RCS
President Karl Schmidt that
RCS would have to find an
alternative venue for the Ball.
Last Friday Mr Schmidt met
Prof Way to discuss the matter
but was unable to persuade him
to change his mind. This was
because Silwood residents did
not want RCS to use their
facilities any more, and while
Prof Way sympathised with
RCS, he said that his residents
must come first.
Poof in
Boots?
Nick Gardner, IC's resident
eccentric, has entrusted FELIX
with a Czechoslovakian riding
outfit for use by the FELIX
Editor on formal occasions.
Mr Gardner explained that he
has long been disappointed that
the FELIX Editor has no official
dress and he feels that the riding
outfit fills this long-felt want
admirably.
The outfit is too small for the
current Editor, Martin S Taylor
('too big for his boots' as the
staff were quick to point out) so
it is here shown being modelled
by Union President Stephen
Goulder in his capacity as
President of the FELIX Club.
Chas
to Sue?
Charles Fuller, RCS Honorary
Secretary and acting President, is
considering suing ICU Deputy
President John McCallion and
FELIX Editor Martin S Taylor
over allegedly libellous comments
made in the Deputy President's
annual report and the FELIX
Editorial.
In an exclusive interview on
Wednesday afternoon Mr Fuller
told FELIX that he had not yet
seen his solicitor but was waiting
to see what was written about
the matter in today's edition.
His concern stems from a
paragraph on transport in the
Deputy President's report in
which Mr McCallion alleges that
a Union van was used for
mascotry purposes when Mr
Fuller was well aware that this is
prohibited under Union rules.
Mr Taylor in his editorial
supported Mr McCallio'n, and
described Mr Fuller's attitude as
'incredibly petty'.
