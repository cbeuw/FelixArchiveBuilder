The Red Rag
Last week I described Chas
Fuller's attitude as incredibly
petty when he threatened a no
confidence motion in the Exec.
Because of-my comment he has
now started talking of taking
legal action against me.
I suppose one should feel
sorry for someone whose per-
sonal pride is so great that he
reacts so violently to criticism,
but I really find it quite impos-
sible to take Chas seriously any
more, and I know most of the
senior Union officials do too.
So here you are Chas: I do not
retract anything I wrote last
week—indeed, I feel that you are
being more petty than ever in
your threats of legal action
(which I believe to. be quite
empty). Nevertheless, if you still
feel as strongly as you did on
Wednesday then go ahead and
sue me. I look forward to
receiving your writ with antici-
pation:
Next Week's FELIX
As expected, this week's FELIX
has turned out rather smaller
than usual and many of the
regular features have been cut;
not that many of you are going
to be reading it, of course, with
national news being a little more
EDITORIAL
important than the future of the
Silwood Ball.
Next week, though, I hope to
produce a bumper issue with all
the regular features and several
pages of special articles for the
summer. In particular, there will
be a double-spread of Pinocchio
puzzles (his final bow), a light-
hearted news quiz on the goings-
on throughout the year, an
article by Stephen Goulder on
RCS, an article by RCS on
Stephen Goulder, a sporting
review of the year from sports
editor Chris Mallaband and an
unsporting review of the year
Below the Belt which will
contain all the incriminating
stories and photographs we
haven't dared to print sooner.
Copy deadline was 5:30pm
yesterday (I warned you last
week) but since there is quite a
bit of controversial material in
this issue I've extended the
deadline for letters until Monday
9:30am.
Naturally I would appreciate
as much help as possible from
staff members past and present
in putting it all together, and
vast quantities of unskilled
labour will be needed to help
collate next Wednesday evening.
Publication date is next
Thursday morning. Don't miss
it!
ACC
The A C C elections are on
Tuesday evening at 6:30pm in
the Lower Refectory and it is
essential that all captains, both
new and old, turn up.
Car Rally
Pinocchio and I have done the
bulk of the work on setting lots
of witty and entertaining clues
for you to solve, so I hope there
will be a good number of teams
entering.
Several people have told me
they would like to enter, but
have no car; others have a car
but cannot get a team together,
so if either of these predicaments
apply to you, be not deterred but
come and give your names to me
as soon as possible and I'll
match up earless teams with
teamless cars.
The rally starts at 9:30am on
Sunday June 19 and goes on
until about 1:00pm. If you feel it
will be any help to you, last
year's clues are on display in the
FELIX Office.
Impossible Without
Melanie Steel (and Lady Olga
Maitland) for the interview,
Diane Love for What's On,
Andy Grimwash for Exec News
Part 2 (the boredom continues),
Nick Pyne who must take most
of the blame for the avant-garde
page 2, Karl Schmidt for the
news, Dave Jago, Lee Paddon
and Peter Rodgers for pasting
up, and Maz and Pete the Print.
Special thanks to Adrian
James who was news editor until
last week when he resigned due
to pressure of work. Many of
you will by now have heard that
Adrian's last lead story in last
week's FELIX (Exam Students
Disrupt Window Cleaners) was
completely fictitious. I was
totally fooled, and after I
had recovered from my initial
annoyance I found the whole
thing very funny; apologies to
anyone who did not.
Adrian has made plain his
dislike of this year's headline
style in his letter on page 2, and
so this week's headlines are
dedicated to his memory.
