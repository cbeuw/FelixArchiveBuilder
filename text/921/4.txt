Letters Felix 921 10 January 1992
Sorry about the Queue
Dear Adam.
As the official immediately
responsible for NatWest's College
Banking facilities, I was very
concerned to read the letter o f
complaint recently published in
your Issue N o 916 dated 8th
November.
Certainly, I should be grateful i f
the writer would kindly accept my
sincere apologies for the
inconvenience suffered when he/she
called at our College Enquiries
Counter only to be faced with a
lengthy queue resulting in the
consequential delay encountered
before being seen by a member o f
our staff.
I accept that queues do occur
from time to time, particularly at
peak periods, but customer traffic
flow is regularly monitored and it
is a relatively rare event for one o f
our customers needing to wait
longer than 5 or 6 minutes before
they are served, indeed for much of
an average business day customers
can be served almost immediately
upon arrival.
If, however, any o f your readers
feel they do encounter unreasonable
delays in waiting to be served, then
it would be extremely helpful if they
would kindly let me have details o f
the relative circumstances so that I
can investigate and i f appropriate
take remedial action to prevent any
subsequent recurrence.
Y o u r readers may also be
interested to know that work is now
p r o c e e d i n g o n the entire
refurbishment of NatWest's College
Branch with a view to the creation
of a much more friendly banking
environment.
We continually review ways in
which we can improve our sevice
and from the 3rd February 1992 we
will be extending our College
Branch openign hours to 9am to
4pm daily. Hopefully, this action
will also assist in helping to avoid
any congestion w h i c h has
previously occasionally occurred at
peak periods.
Naturally, I am anxious that we
are seen to provide a quality
banking service for our much
valued college clientele as I trust is
indicated by the action we are
currently taking with the intention
of making life easier for our
customers.
Yours sincerely,
G Jamieson, Imperial College
Service.

Dear Adam,
Tom di Giovanni (Felix N o 919)
need have no worry about a
Christian writing a narrow-minded
and ill-reasoned article in Felix.
They're so damned good at them
they can have them printed in much
loftier publications. I would be
grateful if he could qualify his
statement that ' w e are a l l
brainwashed from a very early age
into thinking that the world has no
need for G o d . . . ' . I don't know in
which country's education system
he was brought up i n , but I would
be very surprised i f it was Britain.
In my formative years Christianity
was all that was pumped into me.
Many years ago I had already
become a (devout?) atheist but
Christianity was the only view that
was ever put forward at school
(hymns and readings from the bible
in assembly etc).
L o o k at e v o l u t i o n and
Christianity as physical theories
(which he appears to be inviting
when he says '.. .neither one can be
proved or disproved.'). I could also
point out here that theories cannot
be proved, they just work until they
are found not to work and are thus
disproved (in their original form at
least). Darwin did not invent
evolution and then go around
forcing evidence to fit his belief.
This, however, is the action o f the
religious believer who drops his
toast butter side down in the
morning and concludes that it is
punishment for him forgetting his
prayers the previous evening. One
important aspect of the testing of a
theory is the production o f
supporting evidence. Evidence for
evolution is all around us (the
diversity of life). What evidence is
there for Christianity? The bible?
Deriving predictions and testing
them against observation is also
another vital process i n the
methodology o f science.
Hypothesis: humanity started
with Adam and Eve (Eve being
created from Adam—neat trick,
eh?).
Prediction? Well, assume them to
be white people. W e can thus
predict that all their children will be
white.. .oh dear. W e appear to have
a slight problem. Okay, well we can
amend the theory to allow for this
by including a non-linear term, so,
that has the required properties.
W e l l , well, after factorisation,
normalisation, and taking the real
part we find that 0=evolution.
Having now brought this new
function into the theory we find we
no longer need the previous
(hypothesized) boundary condition
(Adam and Eve at t = 0 ) .
I apologise to T o m , being a
mathemetician he probably won't
appreciate my 'physicist's' proof
(but it was fun all the same).
I do envy people like Christians,
though. It must be really nice
having this superbeing watching
over you, and loving you, and what
a shame it is when people try to
rock the boat, with these nasty ideas
about God not existing. Personally
I could temporarily suspend my
rational side (since religion cannot
be rationalised) and agree to the
possible existence o f God, although
with it, o f course, when one looks
at the world around us, it's obvious
he's a total bloody sadist.
Oops, I think I've just committed
blasphemy.

Dear Adam.
Following my Rag Week stunt of
dying my hair IC colours I would
like to take this opportunity to thank
the following people.
Baker Mulligan Hairstylists o f
King Street Hammersmith for dying
my hair, free of charge, over a
period o f four and a half hours,
especially Barbara and Melanie, the
two stylists responsible for the
dreadful deed.
Dear Adam,
In Felix on 11 December, you
published a letter from B e n
Gladwyn under the heading of 'Run
Out', in which he wrote that the
Careers Service had run out of
Standard Application Forms.
The facts are that we reordered
1000 S A F ' s from our supplier on
3 December. Despite chasing on 9th
and 13th, we received only 100 on
19th and 100 on 2 January. In the
meantime we had to photocopy
100's o f forms to supplement our
stock of 300 at the time of ordering.
We still await the balance of 800
which we ordered.
In his letter Ben also refers to
'standard application forms in the
appropriate boxes'. I assume he is
referring to the E m p l o y e r
Application Forms. When stocks
are l o w , we regularly phone
employers and ask them to send
additional forms. Some employers
Wella Hair Care for donating the
necessary dyes.
And everybody who sponsored
me or made a donation.
I have so far collected over £200
for this stunt and money is still
outstanding. If you sponsored me
and haven't paid yet please see me
or pop along to the Rag Office on
a lunchtime and pay there.
Thankyou,
Rachel Mountford, Civ Eng 2.
respond quickly, but some only
send a few which are rapidly taken,
and some say that they are unable
to send us any more bulk copies and
ask us to advise students to phone
them individually for copies.
A possible explanation for this
situation is that students are wisely
spreading their nets wider in their
search for employment at the same
time employers have fewer
vacancies and are trying to limit the
number of applications by making
it more difficult to get application
forms.
I would like to reassure your
readers that we are equally
frustrated by these problems and
that we are seeking to maintain
adequate stocks of all application
forms.
Yours sincerely,
John Simpson, Director.
Careers Advisory Service.
