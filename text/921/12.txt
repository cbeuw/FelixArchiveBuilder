The numbers of students at Imperial
College have increased to 6356,
according to a provisional report in
December's College Gazette. The
final count, which is expected to
rise when a l l students have
registered, is currently being
processed.
The Rector, Sir Eric A s h , has
emphasised the importance • o f
achieving the targets for student
numbers, especially the numbers of
students from Britain and the
European Community, as these
were less than the number o f
students that the College receives
funding for from the Universities
Funding Council ( U F C ) . M r Keith
Access to the College will be
severely restricted out o f hours
when the installation o f the new
security 'swipe.card' system is
completed. A l l College properties
are to be fitted with the magnetic
card readers and doors will only
unlock i f a valid pass card is used.
Half o f the work to install the
system has already been completed
and it could be working by
February. Every student and
member of staff of Imperial College
will be photographed and issued
with a pass card, and students of the
Royal School of Mines and staff in
the Union Office have already been
photographed though have not yet
been issued with the cards.
M r Terry Briley, Deputy Head of
Security, told Felix that the new
system w o u l d be a great
improvement on the present, which
he described as being 'unreliable'.
He suggested that other
A spokeswoman from London
Regional Transport told Felix that
'the prices are put up once a year
only although this year, we know,
they have increased more than
inflation. A l l the revenue from the
fares does go towards keeping the
service running and although we get
a grant from the government the
taxes that people pay over here are
far less than in other countries with
the same public services.'
It is estimated that the staff and
students o f Imperial College spend
over £ l m per year on London
Transport alone.
Harrison, o f the Registry division,
said that this was 'not the case for
post-graduate student numbers, for
which we are in excess.'
When asked what the possible
repercussions of this could be, M r
Harrison replied that he couldn't
say exactly as the U F C has
introduced a new funding system
for this year by which colleges bid
for the funds made available by the
G o v e r n m e n t . A s far as
undergraduates are concerned, M r
Harrison was unable to say what
effect the apparent surplus in their
funding would have, saying that he
couldn't 'comment on the claw back
mechanism.'
improvements would include better
communication between security
guards and explained that this
would make the security guards
'feel safer and more assured'. H e
continued by saying that the aim of
the new system was to stop crime
through 'controlling the perimeter
and supervising the interior' by
leaving security guards free to
provide a 'patrolling presence' that
would deter intruders.
Zoe' H e l l i n g e r , I C U n i o n
President, told Felix that the
changes w o u l d 'decrease the
observational work done by security
guards... releasing some to be on
the move'. She explained that
recently there have been a lot o f
thefts occurring outside college
hours, including the theft o f
£10,000 worth o f equipment from
the Dramatic Society in the Union
Building at the beginning o f the
year.
The House of Commons Select
Committee on Education, Science
and Arts will visit Imperial College
on Wednesday.
The visit is part of a national
investigation into the state of student
welfare. The Select Committee will
be meeting representatives o f the

Poverty
The Student Union will issue a
questionnaire covering student
poverty to all students at Imperial
College on Monday 13th January.
The survey will ask similar
questions to the access funds form,
but includes consideration of how
much debt a student may have
carried over from previous years.
Each form will be treated as
confidential and space is provided
for comments about the how
effective the Union is in the field o f
student welfare.
Students should respond to this
survey as quickly as possible so that
group who will have 15 minutes to
put forward their case.
Zoe Hellinger, Union President,
said the current survey on student
hardship as well as the level o f
overdrafts at Imperial College
would be put forward as evidence,
and she hoped that students would
co-operate.

Theft
A thief has received nine months
imprisonment and been ordered to
pay the College £300 compensation
after being charged with three
burglaries.
M r Sedat Ozbilen, a 32 year old
former research assisitant at the
College, was recorded to have
stolen 129 items, mainly from the
Materials department. The stolen
items were mostly computers and
computer related objects, but he
also had a number o f identity cards,
cheque cards and college keys. M r
O z b i l e n was spotted i n the
M e c h a n i c a l E n g i n e e r i n g
department the Thursday before last
by Martin Douglas and Dicky
Dashwood following the arrival of
a courier at the college who was to
take 12 boxes to Heathrow airport
bound for Turkey. It is beleived that
the stolen items from previous thefts
will not be recovered.
Quest
the results can be presented to the
House o f C o m m o n s Select
Committee on education, which
looks into such issues as student
poverty. They will be in College
this Wednesday, so the questionnaires
should be returned to the Union by
Monday so that the information can
be processsed. I C Union president,
Zoe Hellinger, added that students
now had a rare chance to influence
the way they are treated.
These comments were
enthusiastically endorsed by the
Rector, Sir Eric A s h .
