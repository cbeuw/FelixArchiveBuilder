Angus Fraser, College Managing Director
all-out strike action o n 8th
November that community came to
their rescue on 4th December. 'The
unions' were mere vehicles for a
demonstration, not of any sort o f
self interest, but of the very highest
moral principle by the members of
that community. A n d , no doubt,
whatever the financial plight of the
College as a whole, privatised
security is no longer a serious
runner. Commerce failed because
the place is just too goddam
friendly.
I have to admit to not knowing
much about Imperial. But I have a
suspicion that as industry constantly
tries to renew itself in the face o f
world competition, just a little of the
boffinry which makes it possible
comes from behind this college's
ugly facades. What better place to
raise the questions o f whether this
process, in the name of the common
good, can only proceed by creating
victims.
Until the collapse of the Soviet
system, such a questions could only
be asked at the risk of McCarthy ite
victimisation. T o doubt the good
sense o f creating redundancies for
the few to help raise productivity
for the benefit of the many was to
invite a double condemnation. O n
the one hand it meant being a
mindless shop floor militant. On the
other, to be a traitor—either of the
Stalinist or, its mirror image, the
Trotskyist sort. But now the gounds
of this most British constraint upon
freedom of speech have been swept
away, there is no excuse for silence.
The security debacle should
concentrate Imperial's collective
mind. H o w can it leap to the
defence of its own, yet unthinkingly
supply the economy as a whole with
the means o f pursuing 'normal
commercial practice'? O u r means
of creating wealth may lag far
behind that o f Japan or Germany.
But this should not distract us from
the fact that it is almost
unimaginably greater even than a
generation ago. A n d surely its need
for less and less labour shoud be a
benefit to the workforce, not a
penalty. T h e challenge is to
overcome its ruthlessness and share
its fruits.
There are issues here which go to
the heart of Imperial's educational
and research function. Is it too
much to ask for serious debate
before security fades back into the
fabric?
Meanwhile, to make a very
modest living indeed, the security
guards don't just have to work
nights, they have to work daytime
overtime on 42 weekends a year as
well. A n d that, for goodness sake,
is something we are forced to try
and defend.
Dear Adam,
Many people in the College have
expressed concern and dismay over
the aims and conduct of the current
security review.
A s far as the former are
concerned, the position has been
clear-cut from the start. The
College needs to improve its
security arrangements and it needs
to do so without increasing its costs.
The existing security operation is
simply not set up to provide the
level of service, which this complex
site requires on a cost-effective, 24
hours a day, 365 days a year basis.
That is not to say that our
messengers and security staff are
not extremely loyal, conscientious
servants of the College. N o one has
ever doubted that. It is just that the
systems and working practices upon
which the present operation is based
are ill-adapted to the requirements
of the College in the 1990's.
Apart from failing to meet our
minimum cover requirements, the
current operating system is
expensive. University management
statistics suggest strongly that we
are paying substantially over the
odds for custodial services, as a
proportion o f total expenditure.
Whilst we are evidently not as
broke as many universities and
colleges—thanks to our relatively
tight management controls—we
certainly have nothing to be
complacent about. W e need to look
for every opportunity to reduce
non-academic expenditure and
improve services, in order to
support the all important academic
mission of the College. That is
surely the duty o f the
Administration.
After more than six months o f
detailed study, we identified a
possible way o f satisfying both our
operational and financial criteria.
We presented that proposal to the
Unions on 7th November and have
been in discusssions with them since
that time, following an extension of
the initital 30 day consultation
period to 8th January. I cannot say
here what the outcome of those talks
will be. What I can say however,
is that the management involved
have acted throughout in a proper
and professional manner, as one
would expect of any good, caring
employer.
C h a n g e is never easy,
p a r t i c u l a r l y when it affects
individuals and the way they do
their jobs. W e are not the first to
grapple with these sorts o f issues
and we cannot afford to be the last
to do so in the university sector.
Yours sincerely,
Angus Fraser.
