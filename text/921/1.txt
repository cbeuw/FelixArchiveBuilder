Security Update Wolff Visit
Strike action could again affect
Imperial College as the negotiation
period on the proposals to sack all
Security and Messenger Staff has
now ended.
The consultations between the
Trade U n i o n s a n d S h e r f i e l d
Administrators were given until
Wednesday 8th January to produce
an alternative to the proposed
redundancies. The final decision
will be made by the Rector, Sir Eric
Ash, after receiving a report from
M s Caroline F o x , Director o f
Personnel. Staff Unions have also
asked to personally see the Rector
about the issue.
Sue Sharpe, of the Manufacturing
Science and Finance Union (MSF),
said that she was not optimistic
about the result, adding that i f the
decision was not favourable further
industrial action w o u l d be
recommended to Trade Union
members. M s Sharpe commented
that d u r i n g negotiations the
management's requirements had
changed. She continued by saying
that M r Keith Reynolds, Head o f
College Security, had 'moved the
goalposts' and was determined to
contract out S e c u r i t y and
M e s s e n g e r w o r k to outside
companies.
M r Reynolds was unavailable for
comment yesterday, but the Rector,
Sir Eric A s h , defended his position
saying that 'no-one would be
happier than Keith if an agreement
had been reached' and that criticism
was 'untrue' and 'unfair'.
After comments from academic
staff inferring that communications
with administration had become
very poor, a series of meetings took
place this week. O n Wednesday
evening a meeting was called by Sir
Eric A s h with teaching staff. In the
meeting the Rector said that the
practice of debiting departmental
accounts by central administration
was 'evil' and should not happen,
despite allegations from several
academics that this occurs and that
they have limited information about
the state o f the accounts for which
they are supposed to have
responsibility.
Angus Fraser, the Managing
Director of Imperial College, met
members of Physics Department
Staff yesterday lunchtime. Those
present at the meeting also
expressed c o n c e r n about
communications in College and
suggested that a senate be set up to
represent views within College. M r
Fraser and the Rector both referred
to the Board of Studies as the forum
for debate but added that ways o f
improving communication were
being considered.
Representatives o f the
manufacturing Unions attended
both meetings. Sue Sharpe o f M S F
said it was clear that the
Administration regarded only the
academic staff o f importance at
Imperial College.
Doctor Taylor Russell, of the
Association of University Teachers.
( A U T ) , said that suspicion of and
anger at administrators is common
if something goes wrong, whoever
is really at fault. When asked if
supportative industrial action by
lecturers would.happen i f further
strikes occurred, D r Taylor Russell
said it was too premature to say but
that support for the strike had been
wide and many people were upset
that colleagues were losing their
jobs.
