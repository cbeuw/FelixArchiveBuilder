Union Felix 921 10 January 1992
Poet Dear Marge...
Hello again after the Christmas
break.
Another term of fun and frolics
upon us all, so what's ahead?
Parties and bands first, tonight is
the New Year's Carnival,
People should note that the Union
bar is only open to Carnival goers
and entry is only allowed with a
Union card, doors open at 8pm.
Yet more live bands play for free
on Mondays this term.
Not many people expect free bands
to be any good, so pop along, you
will be pleasantly surprised.
Every second Wednesday (starting
next week) hosts the bar quiz.
W e have a new quizmaster this
term, so come and stretch your
brain a little.
Yet again, we have lots of bar
extensions and discos, hopefully we
should have extensions on
Wednesdays and Fridays (it all
depends what the nice police people
say).
Elections crop up in February, with
the sabbatical posts up for grabs
from 17th February.
A l l other posts are open for election
from 24th February.
Results for all of these will be.
decided at the U G M (and election
results meeting) on March 12th.

Rag
The Rag New Year began in earnest
on January 2nd when Penguin,
Tamsin and myself set off for
Cardiff for the National Rag
Conference 1992. A n annual event
with almost 200 delegates from
Rags as far apart as W y e College
Kent and Edinburgh University, the
aim of the conference is to help
Rags liaise, swap ideas, meet
charities and to discuss all aspects
of running and organising a Charity
Rag.
Thursday was basically arrival
and introductions followed by an
amazing five legged pub crawl and
Blues Brothers disco. Friday saw
the start of the Seminars on subjects
ranging from Silly Stunts, i.e.
Bungy Jumping, Rag Balls and
Balls Ups, and sponsored events to
Rag Mags, Finance (or how to
fiddle your tax), Merchandise and
M o t i v a t i o n . A l s o r u n n i n g
throughout the day was the
Charities and trade fair which
provided an excellent opportunity to
meet some of the Charities Rag
Welcome to the new year and
welcome to another issue of Dear
Marge. The place where you can
pick up all the juicy tit bits about
the people we all know and love.
Before the end of term there were
even more goings on around college
that we felt people just had to know
about. Zoe' Hellinmoose, our
beloved Pres person was seen out
and about quite a lot in the final
weeks of term and with several
different members of the college.
The first occasion was at the St.
Mary's Christmas musical where
she was seen by one of our intrepid
reporters in the company of C & G U
bolt bearer, Mark Jackson alias
CARRY
YOUR
UNION
CARDS
To protect both you and the Union
Building, during busy evenings, new
security arrangements have been
introduced. This will mean that on
Wednesday and Friday evenings all
visitors will be required to show their
Union cards/Staff cards or be signed in
as guests (up to two per Union card
holder) before entry will be permitted.
supports and establish contacts with
them for the future.
Sunday saw the first A G M of
N A R (National Association of
Rags), set up at last year's
conference, after which we all
packed up and went our separate
ways, having learnt (and drunk and
danced) a lot, over what was
definitely a highly productive and
enjoyable weekend.

Trigger, for some unknown reason.
Was this true love blossoming? I
fear not, for only a week later she
was seen to be leaving the bar with
a member of the other side - R C S U
Theta bearer, Bob Leamon. Is Lady
Penelope a one for the gents or was
this all harmless frolics - (being
discreet and unavoidable o f
course)? Later that same week she
was at the mines ball with none
other than M r . Steve Farrant,
Union Honorary Secretary - come
on down Steve the time is right!
Just as an after note... what is this
we hear about Joe Fernley and Zoe
Hellinmoose at the piss up after the
second council of last term? They
were 'left alone' together for far too
long and were noted to have had a
very steamy evening together. W i l l
this, or any other event, be denied?
I wonder.
It also seems that Trigger himself
has been out on the town too. He
was seen at a party 'sharking' after
a young - very young - exceedingly
young - in fact only 14 years of age
- young lady just before the end of
term. Does this mean that the great
white has resorted to paedophilia as
he has failed in every other area?
A few other little tit bits for this
week include...
Did you know that Mandy Hurford,
U n i o n M a n a g e r , only joined
N A L G O a week before the strike
on the 4th December over the
security redundancies? Well I
never.
Also the fact that Ramesh and
Jarve, our two full time Union bar
staff really are the two most
incompatible people on earth and
that if we're not careful there will
be blood shed before too long.
Just remember that if you have a
problem of any kind we could
publish it, take the mickey and
maybe even cure your problem,
except if you fancy a sabbatical for
which the only cure is suicide!
Carnival '92
A new term, new year and probably
a new jumper. To celebrate, Ents
proudly present ' C A R N I V A L '92'
tonight (Friday January 10th) in the
Union Building. If you came to any
of the Freshers' Week events you
know what to expect—hour upon
hour of bands, music, food, drink,
casinos and cocktails. If you have
any booty to shake, you will shake
it down to the ground.
Rising High, the dance label
that's so hot its melting, bring the
famous Rising High Rave to the
Concert Hall—six hours of heavy
duty 3 D sound, crazy lights and
effects, featuring DJs, dancers and
top techno twiddlers The Hypnotist.
Prepare to rage. Downstairs its
indie kids Flood—they've been
compared to Ride—plus an indie
and 70s disco. The notorious C & G
casino will be stripping shorts off
backs in the U D H and the bar will
keep on serving until 2am. Doors
open at 8pm, everything winds
down at 3am. A s usual there will
be free minibus rides home for
women. At £6 on the door its a
steal. A n d if you buy a ticket in
advance it's only a fiver! We must
be mad! We're giving them away!
Entrance by ticket only.
