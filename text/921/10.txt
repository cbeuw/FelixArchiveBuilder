with a rush that he was pale
skinned, something punishable by
death. He went red and began
sweating, blending nicely into the
crowd.
T h e y continued s w i m m i n g
through the soup of music, people
and tension before reaching a dim
corner table where Carefree sat
down with several other shaded and
shady people.
'Sit down.'
Stress obeyed.
'Listen to me.'
Everyone leaned forward in their.
'Sorry?'
'Plug!'
T don't see what you mean.'
' O h , I see. You're playing hard
to get. Okay then, pretty plug?!'
Stress l o o k e d at her in
bewilderment and some fear. -' -
' U m okay.'
'Right, extend your jack line
then.'
'What?'
'Sheesh, I'll do it for you then.'
She reached around his waist.
T can never understand why they
don't have an easier way of
The Inner system
Chapter 9;
Conversation.
By Troy
Tempest.
Carefree hit him again.
'Time to go!'
Groggy and semi-conscious,
Stress staggered after her as she
strode off down the tunnel. She
threaded through the maze of
passageways and the near darkness
before coming out in a dim red neon
section of the inner system. Before
them in a tall corridor with many
entrances the nightclub P O W E R
P L U G S flashed a welcome out of
the darkness in painful blue and
ultra-violet neon. Carefree strode
forward.
At the door of the club a four foot
wide robot bouncer had been built
into the wall. Unfortunately the
builders hadn't made allowances for
this which meant that Stress and
Carefree had to squeeze between
the bouncer and the other door
frame.
' I D ! '
The voice was so low the wall
shuddered. Carefree handed him
two cards. The bouncer checked
them before extending an antenna
out of his lapel which sent a thin red
beam up and down the pair of them.
They passed through into the club.
A s they threaded through the
crowds Stress wondered why the
lighting seemed to be giving the
people a funny complexion. Then
he suddenly realised that it was
because they were all deeply
tanned. The knowledge came back
seats, clustering around Carefree.
' W e can talk in complete
freedom, N o one can overhear us
from another table.' It was true. In
the heat, smoke and perfume the
words were coughing and dying as
soon as they were leaving her
mouth.
T Carefree Killing have gained
direct evidence of the terrible
organisation outside of our system.'
Stress nodded and l o o k e d
interested.
'The pale faces are just outside
the system! They're wearing suits
and look highly organised!'
Stress stopped nodding. He
gaped.
'We've had a tip off. There's a
lady over at the bar who works in
one of the complex's top secret
departments. Stress, an alien here
to help us, will go over and chat to
her. They'll plug and go off
together. Stress will find everything
about the department and report
back to us. If they catch him and kill
him they won't be able to connect
him with us.'
'Wait a second. I can't agree with
all this!'
'Look, alien.'
A l l faces turned to him and he felt
very alone.
'If you are thinking about
chickening out.'
She held up a small black gun.
'This is a futility gun. It passed
through the door check because it
doesn't fire bullets but it'll kill you
all the same. N o w , are we agreed?'
Stress dumbly nodded.
' N o w strap this box around your
waist. It's a matchman programmed
with all the things she's looking for.
Y o u ' l l know when to use it.'
Meekly Stress tied the black box
around his waist and clambered
over to the bar. Squeezing into a
space by the girl he said loudly to
her ear.
'Would you like a drink?'
'Yeah, okay. Would you like to
plug?'
checking the character compatibility
of citizens.'
She grabbed the box and pulled
an extendable lead from it. She
grasped the jack at the end and
inserted in a socket in the blackbox
clearly visible under her tight, small
t-shirt. O n a small screen on its side
w o r d s and numbers started
flickering down the screen.
Compatibility Values:
Attractiveness 85%
Wealth: 78%
Influence: 93%
Height: 84%
Ambition: 82%
Parents: 23%
The last line flashed bright red.
With a big sigh the girl pulled the
jack out and handed it back to
Stress.
'Oh well. W e could have made
a great couple. B y e ! '
She wandered off down the bar.
Stress gulped his drink and glanced
behind him. A t the table Carefree
pulled out the gun and aimed at
him, fingering the trigger. Seized
by sudeen fear Stress threw himself
to the right as the barman behind
him suddenly shouted;
' A A A A A A H H H H H H ! ! ! What's
the point!!'
Carefree swore and aimed again
at him. Panicking, Stress ran down
the bar, spilling drinks and
interrupting pluggers. Behind him
there were scattered sobs and cries
of despair as Carefree tried to hit
the fleeing fugitive.
Stress had almost reached the end
of the bar when he pulled up short,
realising with unknown clarity of
mind that all this pointless running
away was a waste of time. He
wasn't going to get away so he may
as well go back and get it over with.
He was about to turn around and
walk back to the table when part of
the floor in front of him slid aside
and a bulky shape in a tuxedo
swung up out of the floor at him.
'Got ya punk!'
A forehead hit him in the face
with stunning force and he blacked
out.
