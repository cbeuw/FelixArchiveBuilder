Opinion Felix 921 10 January 1992
The workforce has won all the
arguments—on ground o f
management's chosing. If it's
security you want then the last thing
you should do is hire a labour-only
contractor paying poverty wages. If
you want to avoid the nastier
confrontations assocated with the
job, you don't want brawny young
men doing it. The secret is to have
people who know all the wrinkles
of Imperial's jumble of buildings.
Getting r i d o f their valuable
experience and commitment could
prove a costly mistake. A n d that's
it is obvious that the problem of
funding is reason enough to regard
the w o r k f o r c e as w h o l l y
dispensible—with, of course, a bob
or two to take down the road. These
managers simply do not share the .
same moral universe as the security'
staff.
This is where management
hierarchies merge so neatly into a
d i s t i n c t i v e l y B r i t i s h class
background. Decisions to excise
people en masse them from a
tradition older than the industrial
revolution. Indeed, i f Marx was

Thoughts
before you think about them!
But it appears many have thought
about their plight.
When people use coercion against
their fellow human beings they
usually have a moral explanation for
their actions. In other words they
can give you reasons why they think
they have right on their side. So the
workforce, in it's all-out strike on
8th November, believed it was
doing no more than defending itself
from Imperial's stated intention to
close the job down.
But what o f the moral basis o f
management's position? T h e
Director of Estates gave us two
answers which would appear to
occupy that special place i n
everyday thought normally reserved
for morality. The first was that his
'remit' was to save 30 per cent on
wage costs. The second was that his
plans were 'normal commercial
practice'.
director, replies
opposite.
The first reply is simply that of
the bureaucratic post holder. It
means T have a duty to my
superiors and I am only carrying out
their orders.' This locates the
problem further up the hierarchy.
And that is just the point. The
management decision makers are,
in every sense, so far removed from
the workforce that its human
qualities are too abstract to have any
impact on their decisions. T o them
right, several centuries o f
enclosure, and later the large scale
and much more rapid highland
clearances, created the conditions
necessary for the mergence o f
genuine capitalist agriculture and
fuelled the Industrial cities with
labour. The moral justifications was
'improvement'. Coercing people in
the common interest runs deep in
our national culture.
Coercing workers is something
the holders of great power have
always had others to do for them.
Apart from the odd landowner with
a convenient coalmine underneath,
they certainly never soiled their
fingers with anything to do with
industry. They were instead
thoroughly obsequious to the
industrial capitalists w h o
succeeded—by providing their sons
with wives and showering them
with dotty honours. Whether the
contemporary ruling elite can bring
itself to fill the tawdry House of
Lords with Japanese managers
remains to be seen.
And that brings me to the second
moral argument for a private
security w o r k f o r c e — ' n o r m a l
commercial practice'. Again we
find a vast gulf between people,
bridged only by price and contract.
Commerce can wipe a whole
workforce off the balance sheet by
virtue of its ability to avoid the
question of proper conduct towards
the people it excludes by price.
So why didn't it work here? Well,
we have a nice little illustration o f
just how far commerce depends on
the absence of any social link
between those who make the deals
and those who suffer their effects.
However much Imperial may be
divided by chasms of class and
status, it has proved to be a
r e m a r k a b l y resilient moral
community. Once the security
guards and messengers had proved
their willingness to fight, by taking
