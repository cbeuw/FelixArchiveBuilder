interviews Two
Lost Sons.
First Lost Son
Where are you from?
Three of us are from Redcar, in the
North-East, near Middlesborough,
and the drummers from County
Durham, but we all met in London.
So you're not Irish at all?
Not at all.
O h .
We thought you were Irish.
You tend to tour with Irish bands,
like last year you were with An
Emotional Fish, and now tonight
you're with the Pogues and
Storm.
Yeah, we do, I mean Storm are
really good and they haven't got a
record deal, and then there's us,
stuck right in the middle, we'll give
them some real music. But the
crowds have been really good to us,
as there's always a large Clash
element in the crowds. I mean, the
Clash are a big band in their own
right, but tonight, Brixton's like
Clash country, isn't it?
Do you think that Joe Strummer
will ever replace Shane?
No, no one could replace Shane, but
Strummer's a sort of a legend, and
he really complements the Pogues.
And like there's no other bands that
Strummer could be in, apart from
The Clash and The Pogues, so I
think it works really well.
Do you think, personally, that
The Clash will reform?
Yes
Probably.
Why the name?
It's mainly because my brother and
me, we were in the band, writing
the songs, and it's something my
dad said, 'Where's Pete and Phil,
those two lost sons?'
What's it been like, supporting
the Pogues?
Brilliant. The best thing is, like, it's
our first proper tour going to all
these beautiful theatres, like the
Edinburgh Playhouse. A n d like
playing to all these big crowds, our
music doesn't really work on a
small scale.
Is it only in Britain you've been
supporting them?
Yeah, in the main. There's one in
Dublin that we did.
How did you get together?
Well me and my brother we've
been writing together for ever, and
the bassist, he's from Redcar, but
we met him when we moved down
to London, in a squat in Kings
Cross, and the drummer, he used
to be in this club called the
Timebox, which turned into Hype,
which turned into the Pop Club, at
the Bull and Gate in Kentish Town,
and he used to go down there every
night, with people like Jon Beast,
who used to run it, he works for
Carter now, and the drummer and
two other guys who've formed
Whirlpool. W e used to have a
beatbox, but we always needed a
drummer, so we eventually got
him, and everything turned out fine.
Second Lost Son
What are your influences,
musically?
A l l the people in the band are all
pretty similar but different, the
bassist really loves The Ramones,
and Blondie, and I've always been
a big Clash fan, so it's been good
working with Joe Strummer, and
the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Bob
Dylan. I just like a lot of music.
Currently though, I like the Wonder
Stuff.
Fourth Lost Son
Your Favourite films?
(We're getting desperate for
questions here.)
Betty Blue, I love, and then there's
this old black and white one called
Harvey, with James Stewart, and
he's got this imaginary friend who's
this six foot white rabbit.
What do you think of the music
press?
Well it doesn't really bother me, I
mean it's only one person's opinion
isn't it? I don't like it when the
journalists are in bands though.
What's the best piece of advice
you've ever been given?
Enjoy yourself, no matter what goes
wrong, I mean tonight, like 99% of
the people here tonight are here to
see the Pogues, and we go on just
thinking they've not heard of us,
that we won't have any friends in
the crowd, this is just what we do
What* are your plans?
We've already recorded an album,
with Pat Collier, who did The
Wonder Stuff's album, and there'll
probably be another single in
January or February, and then
another tour, either headlining or
support, and we'll see how it goes.
And then we've got a release in
America, so we'll be off there.
(We've run out of questions now.)
So, we've established that they're
generally nice blokes to talk to, but
what are they like live? A lot better
than in the studio, actually. Quite
rocky, quite groovy, quite good.
And if they do tour this spring, I'd
advise you to go and see them.
Quite.
