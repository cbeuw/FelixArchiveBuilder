10 January 1992 Felix 921 Music
Falling Joys
- Jennifer
Jennifer was the name of last term's
Felix token D a m n Y a n k . This
position is now open to any people
of A m e r i c a n persuasion, and
applicants should apply to the Felix
office, in the corner o f the Beit
Quad. Duties include making
obtuse comments, being regarded
as stupid by bigoted music editors,
and general serf duties. Benefits
include, well actually there aren't
any.
The Falling Joys are not
American. They're Australian.
C o m i n g from a country that
spawned the Minogue collection is
enough bad luck for anyone in one
lifetime so I've decided to find this
record l i k e a b l e , for totally
subjective reasons. It's not really
that bad anyway. But I wouldn't tell
you i f it was, because I'm being
obtuse, and I did find myself
singing it in the shower. What
further recommendation could you
possibly desire?

Jools Holland
- Thames Poly
Thames Poly's Christmas Carnival
huh? What is a dedicated Imperialist
doing in Woolwich? I came for the
Adventure Babies, but they
cancelled, so I was left with Jools
Holland. But before I get to him,
I'll take you on a mental wander
around the place. A Casino, two
discos, two bars and a bouncy
castle. Groovy! Onto Jools Holland
then.
Striding onto the stage, looking
like a cross between V i c Reeves ana
Dracula (personally I'd rather spend
an evening in the company o f the
latter); onto the stage with a huge
backing band, not Squeeze, nota
bene, with a groovy jive type
sound, breaking into bouts of Rock
. ' n ' Roll every now and again,
including Grear Balls Of Fire,
which, to tell the truth, was the only
song I actually recognised tonight.
But it didn't really matter, cos it was
a damn good night, and whether
you like him or not, Jools Holland
is a damn fine pianist. A n d a jolly
good time was had by a l l .

RADIO LUXEMBOURG THROUGH THE NIGHT
Revolver
- Subterania
Is live music dead? I think not, but
most o f the people who go and see
it should be. With their Mexican
beers and their fake shabby dress,
it makes me want to puke. Queuing
out side they swap stories, and ask
'do they check id here?', sixteen
year olds that think smoking is cool
and wear jeans with holes cut in
them by their mummy's scissors.
They try so hard to be cool and fail
by not being themselves. The bands
are good, but not that good. When
a band like Revolver can be
Rant
Friday night huh? What are you
doing tonight, dear heart? Going
down Southside? Working away
over another stir fry? Going to the
union, G o d forbid? Six quid for a
jumped up disco with all the same
sex-obsessed lager louts and a band
called Flood. Y o u ' d have to pay me
to make me see Flood again. I know
whereof I speak. They're ropey
with a capital Rope. A n d after last
term's auspicious start. I mean two
bearable bands in one night (Pele,
etc.). Unheard o f in recent history.
So what do I suggest? Simple.
Look down into the magic box
below, and stab at it with a pin. I've
even included directions for you, so
no excuses on that front. Y o u can
see a half decent band or two. Meet
new people, you too can find love.
A n d why stop with tonight? Fair
enough, there's sod all on for the
majority o f next week, but I've dug
out a couple for you. H o w easy can
you get? A ready made new year
resolution.
Poddy Music E d .
levitated to the altar o f indie gods
it bodes none too well for the future.
Some people are dancing but are
also looking around to see it they
are doing it properly, trying to look
mean and moody but ending up like
a flock of sheep. Then they finish,
and return for the encore that hadn't
even been asked for, how sad. Then
they go for good, the crowd turn
away and forget what has just
happened in an instant, they have
the 'cred points' and that's all
they're here for. It's a sad night for
music, not the music exactly but I
think these 'indie kids' should get
a life before they ruin live music
and the very gods they pray to.

The Pogues
- Academy
Have you no Shane?' reads the
banner held high by a couple o f the
more inebriated members o f the
audience, the same is written on the
back o f their T-shirts. The other
four thousand people here make the
kind o f noise a cow makes when
she's happy, lowing in agreement.
Are they perhaps annoyed at Shane
departing the group, but who's fault
was that? The lights d i m and six
Irish men come on, and a smaller
guy carrying a beaten up guitar.
One bang on the drums and they're
off. The small one aproaches the
mic and all hell is let rip. He sounds
strangely Irish but doesn't look it,
he's shaking like Elvis Presley on
speed. By now the banner, that had
somehow managed to get hung on
the walls, has been ripped down,
perhaps all is forgiven? They play
through what must be a very tried
and tested set, with one oditty
inserted. The only way you can tell
really is its the only time they don't
use the accordion. The show is
good, but how will I remember it?
Probably by the very nice way the
people apologised for landing on
my feet. Very civilised.
Pebbles.
