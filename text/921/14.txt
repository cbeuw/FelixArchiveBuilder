Felix
Imperial College has a weekly newspaper called
Felix. This has been produced regularly without
break for the last 41 years, and has a weekly run
of 4000 copies. During this time technical and
artistic standards have improved and now the
College is rightly proud of this highly professional
newspaper.
A full-time editor and two professional staff
work with a large and enthusiastic number of
students to produce the paper. All typesetting,
design, printing and finishing is done in-house to
a high standard, as can be seen by the copies
enclosed.
Once at university, students require many
resources such as stationery, books, banking
services, careers information, travel services,
leisure activities and transport. All these concern
students, who are quick to respond to good
advertising. Students have a particular interest in
finding careers, and potential employers can easily
make the initial contact through the pages of
Felix.
Imperial College
Imperial College of Science, Technology and
Medicine is a part of the University of London. It
has over 6,000 undergraduate and postgraduate
students, and a staff of over 3,000.
The College is situated in South Kensington,
with easy access to the West End. Many of the
students live on campus in the Halls of Residence;
others live in Fulham, Chelsea, Hammersmith and
Earl's Court.
Imperial College has been singled out by the
Government as a centre of excellence in the field
of science and technology. It leads research in the
areas of computing, physics, biochemistry and
engineering. Hence many of the students receive
financial sponsorship from government and
industry in addition to their normal grants.
