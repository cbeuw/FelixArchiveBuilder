Jump editoria
Imagine how it feels to float through
2,000 feet of empty blue skies. It's
a sensation that only a small number
of people will ever experience. Y o u 1
will be one of the special few when
you make your sponsored parachute
jump for M E N C A P .
And it's F R E E ! Your training
and jump expenses are all paid for
by M E N C A P . In return they ask
you to make a commitment to then,
by guaranteeing to raise a minimum
of £130 from your sponsors. Please
ask all your friends, family and
colleagues to be generous. Tell
them money is urgently needed to
provide homes, training and
holidays for thousands of people
with a mental handicap.
Be determined. It's not every day
that you take the plunge. A s k your
sponsors to give a little bit extra too.
Y o u r t r a i n i n g course and
parachute jump will take place at a
parachute centre affiliated to the
British Parachute Association. We
will be training and jumping over
a w e e k e n d , the date to be
determined when we know the
numbers.
Y o u will be given intensive
training by British Parachute
instructors. The first day will be
spent p r a c t i s i n g the correct
techniques and usually by the end
of the day you will be prepared to
make your first parachute jump,
safely and confidently.
And then the following day
comes your moment of triumph!
Y o u jump.
For further details come to the
new R a g / E n t s office at any
lunchtime or see your Rag Hall
Rep. Either way do it soon as we
plan to jump near to the end of
term, which will only give you a
two months to raise the
sponsorship.
Rag
As from Monday both I.C.Union
Rag and Ents are moving into a new
office. The new office is in the
Union building on the second floor
roughly above the Union Bar. It is
where the Welfare Office was last
year. Also from Monday it will be
manned every lunchtime and
everyone is welcome to drop in to
see what's going on during the term
and how they can help. Now you've
been given the opportunity, use it.
The new internal phone number is
3517. Please give us a ring if you
want to get involved with rag or
ents on any level. Your help will be
greatly appreciated.
Last Wednesday a meeting was
called between the academics of the
College and the Rector to discuss
the complaints made about the
C o l l e g e administrators. T h e
notification was sent to 600
academics in a letter which the
Rector asked to be kept confidential
within their ' c o m m u n i t y ' . A
number of those attending who had
not directly received the notification
said that the complaints - and the
community - stretched further.
Other comments from the few
academics who bothered to turn up
ranged from 'Imperial pic sees the
departments as an i r r i t a t i o n
r e m o v i n g funds from
Administration with which to make
profit' and 'we are run by a junta'
to 'we need to keep our heads above
water' and T am sure that the
managers intend to support the
academic mission; the problem is
one of communication.' The major
c o m p l a i n t was the lack o f
communication between the centre
and the departments. The Rector
replied that although there were
present problems, particularly in the
implementation of a college-wide
financial control program, these
would come right. He said that the
estates section of the college had
been in an 'absolute shambles... we
owned a house in Evelyn Gardens
we didn't even know about' and
added that the present estates
manager, Gordon Marshall, was
rectifying the situation. 'He is very
good at his job - but sometimes
insensitive to its effect', he said. A s
part answer to the communications
problem, he said that it was the
concern of the 'Network' editor,
E r i c Stables, to ease such
dissemination. He also added that
'there is no major decision that isn't
taken by me - on the advice of the
M P G ' (the Management Planning
Group) and that he couldn't act on
problems that he didn't know about,
that he should be informed of such.
I don't think Sir Eric was too
amused about members of the
student's union being present. If
you have any complaints about how
the college is run, you are duty
bound to inform those who can do
something about it - according to
the Rector himself. Useful addreses
include: Sir Eric A s h , Rector,
Sherfield 541 (tel 3000); Prof Brian
Coles, Pro-Rector, Sherfield 544
(tel 6107); M r Angus Fraser,
Managing Director, Sherfield 545
(3003); and M r Gordon Marshall,
Director of Estates, Sherfield 529
(3402), amongst others.
Overseas Business
Dear Adam,
I would like to use this bit of
space to thank all those people and
their respective societies who
helped to make the 'Overseas
Week' such a huge success. The
main aims of this event were (a) to
draw awareness among all the
students in this college to the large
mix of cultures and nationalities
present and (b) to actually indicate
the existence of the Overseas
Students Committee (OSC) and its
role as one of the major sub-
committees within the Union.
Trying to represent about 25 % of
the college population with a group
of ten people is, as you might
realise, a pretty difficult task.
However, the support and interest
that was received by all those
manning the overseas week stalls
definitely made this task seem more
realistic. Although, I did notice that
a majority of those taking interest
in the stalls were overseas students
themselves, I hope some of the
'home' students did manage to
enlighten themselves as well.
In addition to organising such
events, the O S C is the main
representative body of all the
overseas students at Imperial
College. In attending various
exciting meetings at both the college
union and the University of London
Union as a whole, we aim to
communicate any views and/or
concerns that we may receive from
the students to the 'decision
makers', and where possible
present any solutions ourselves.
At this moment in time, we are
particularly involved in the attempt
to freeze the constant, rapid
increase in Overseas Student fees
and in trying to establish some
solutions to this ongoing problem.
I assure you that for once, we are
achieving some success.
I encourage any student who
might have any views on the
overseas week or the O S C itself to
contact any o f the present
committee so that we may obtain
some more feedback to help us in
the future events which we will be
organising. Speaking of which, our
main event of the year; the
International Night, which has been
an immense success over the past
years will take place around college
on 28th February 1992.
The event will include a huge
food fair; a cultural show and
carnival/disco hosted by all the
overseas societies existing in
college. I definitely hope that more
'home' students will make an effort
to attend this event and be able to
experience what they missed in the
Overseas Week.
Once again, thanks to everybody
involved with the Overseas Week.
A special thank you is in order for
James W o o l v e n , Stephane
Schifflers and the events sub-
committee who really ensured the
success of this event.
Hope to see you at International
Night!
Yours sincerely,
Gaurang Chadha, OSC Chair.
