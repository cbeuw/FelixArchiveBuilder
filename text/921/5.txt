10 January 1992 Felix 921 Opinion
Reality Anally caught up with the
Chancellor of the Exchequer,
Norman Lamont last weekend,
when he admitted that his
predictions for economic recovery
in 1992 were 'over optimistic'.
It had been a tough week for
Lamont. He came under fire from
his own backbenchers, with the
most wounding criticism from
former minister Michael Spicer,
who showed an amazing lack of
confidence in the Chancellor: T
hope Lamont is right .... it will be
a disaster for us if he gets it wrong
... we will simply have to deliver
the goods.'
The damage was worsened when
the Prime Minister joined in.
Considering that it was Major's
mishandling of the economy when
he was Chancellor that has landed
Lamont in his current troubles, then
Major's support was the last thing
Lamont needed. It only served to
confirm the quiet panic on Tory
benches.
Major's main defence of Lamont
is that the world recession is to
blame for the U K downturn. This
is rubbish and he knows it. Britain's
economy went into official
recession months before the rest of
the globe, and into actual, feel- it-
in-your-pocket, recession a long
time before that. In fact, when John
Major was Chancellor.
The question is not really 'who
started the recession?', though the
answer lies somewhere between
Thatcher, Lawson and Major. To
get us out of recession, we need to
ask, 'why is it so deep?'. Step
business failures, 85,000 home
repossessions, and 750,000 more
unemployed, as explained by
Shadow Chancellor, John Smith,
during a recent Commons debate.
Lamont's response was that this is
a price worth paying.
There are those on the Tory right
wing, the rabid right, who blame
E u r o p e a n E x c h a n g e Rate
Mechanism (ERM) membership for
the depth of the recession. By virtue
taxpayers will pay no more - not a
penny, 12% of taxpayers who do
not pay full National Insurance
contributions will now do so. The
40% tax band w i l l remain
unchanged, most 4 0 % rate
taxpayers will stay at 40%, and a
new top rate of 50% will be
introduced for salaries close to
£40,000.
These increases will pay for
pension increases of £5 per week

forward John Major, aspirant bus
conductor who failed an arithmetic
test.
His attempt to cure Britain of
recession was analagous to curing
blood pressure by strangling the
patient. His savage increases in
interest rates hit small businesses
and homeowners. What happened
if they were closed or repossessed?
Tough.
The results of this policy are there
for all to see. In the past twelve
months, there have been 45,000
Major Problems
of timing, the argument appears
reasonable. It is, however, wrong.
E R M membership is not the
problem. What was the problem
was the manner in which Major
bungled our a p p l i c a t i o n .
Announced on the eve of the 1990
Tory Party Conference, he gave the
impression that the move was
political rather than economic. A t
a stroke, Major panicked the
markets, damaged confidence, and
caused a run on sterling.
T h i s p o l i c y o f back door
devaluation and stroke politics has
caused misery and hardship to
millions.
Do not be fooled. Tories are not
worried that the recession is causing
pain. When John Major was
Chancellor he said, ' i f it's not
hurting, it's not working'. Their
concern is that this recession, unlike
the last Tory recession, is too close
to the election for comfort.
So what do they do? D o they
announce innovative policies to kick
start the economy out of recession?
Fat chance. H o w much easier it is
to bribe the voters with a cut in
income tax, or an increase in the
thresholds.
Even here, the Tories are split.
With some ministers demanding a
penny cut in standard rate income
tax, and others urging caution,
Labour's trade spokesman Gordon
Brown has challenged John Major
to state his position.
The position of Neil Kinnock,
Labour leader, and John Smith is
crystal clear. A n y 1992 budget cut
in income tax will be restored when
Labour wins the next election. Neil
Kinnock warns, ' A standard rate cut
will rob the National Health Service
of 1.5 billion pounds'.
Labour is equally clear on its own
tax plans, and has been ruthless in
exposing the Tories as the party of
higher taxes. Kinnock says, 'The
tax burden of the great majority of
British people has gone up in the
Tory years, and we have no wish
to add to it'.
So what is Labour's tax policy?
Eighty-eight per cent of all
Neil Kinnock, Labour Party leadei
for a single person, and £8 per week
for a married couple. They will also
pay for the restoration of child
benefit. This is the thrust of
Labour's anti-poverty campaign.
This is our big idea.
A l l this is clear, up front, and
honest. Now look at the taxing Tory
record, as shown by Department of
Trade and Industry (DTI) figures.
In 1978-9, a married couple with
two children on average earnings
paid 35.2% o f their gross earnings
in tax. In 1990-1, the same couple
now pay 37.5%
In 1978-9, a married couple on
three-quarter average earnings paid
30.9% of their gross earnings in
tax. In 1990-1, they now pay 34.9%
Nothing clear or upfront about
this. Not only do Tory ministers not
talk about these figures, but the DTI
delayed their publication, and
there's certainly nothing honest
about Tory tax claims. The Tories
promised that their government
would not double V A T . Under
Labour, V A T was 8%. Under the
Tories, it is now 17,5%. If the
Tories get back in, V A T could go
up to 22%, if only to pay for their
planned public borrowing.
Another T o r y tax increase.
Another Tory lie. A taxing problem
indeed for Norman and John.
