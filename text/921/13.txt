Felix is normally published every Friday during
term time. One exception is the Freshers' Issue
on Monday 30 September, which provides an
excellent opportunity to reach first year students
as soon as they arrive. Another special issue is
the Careers Felix on Friday 11 October. This
issue is timed to coincide with the College
Careers Fair on the 15 and 16 October, when
many employers meet IC students for the first
time.
