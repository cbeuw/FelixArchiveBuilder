T^very year, a plethora of 'indis-
J_jpensable' golfing accessories |
appear in the shops. Here are two of
this year's inventions which youj
can't afford to be seen without.
The flexi-tee. It may be morel
expensive than conventional tees,

invented a tee withflexiblefibresto
support the golf ball. When you
strike the ball, the fibres move but
: no substantial force is transmitted to
! the spike. The tee stays put so you
11won't be driven mad lookingforlost
tees.
Lost tees are one thing, lost balls
are another. The new telescopic]
\golf ball retriever has a cleverly[
designed scooping end thai, can help]
