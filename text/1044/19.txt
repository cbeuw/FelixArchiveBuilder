I appreciate the difficulty for
invigilators to check every calculator
in the examination hall. This, howev-
er, is not a justification to void the
students' right to choose a calculator
to use. I would like to suggest an
alternative [...]:
In Hong Kong, students sitting
for open examinations are allowed
only to use calculators that carry
approval stamps issued by the Hong
Kong Education Authority. Prior to
the exams, students need to submit
the calculators they intend to use to
the H K E A , who will examine the cal-
culators and mark the machines with
a stamp. Subsequently only calcula-
tors that carry the approval stamp are
allowed to be used in the exam venue
[•••]
A similar scheme may be imple-
mented in the College. Students
could be asked to submit their calcu-
lators to either their departments or
the Board of Examinors for approval
checks; only those machines that
comply to the Board's requirement
will be given the approval [...]
I hope this will help the Board
maintain a control on what calcula-
tors are used in examinations without
facing the students with a difficult
situation where they have to use
unfamiliar instruments in crucial
moments of their academic assess-
ments. Moreover, this would save the
College a considerable sum of money
on purchasing calculators.
Yours sincerely,

Rag and bones to
pick
Dear Felix,
We would like to correct a few
facts that were included in Mark
Bridge's article last week. Firstly, the
Beer Festival did not make a loss as
has been claimed. In fact the event
made a small profit despite having a
lower attendance than previous years.
Over £1200 was raised during
the rest of Rag Week [...] This has
pushed Rag's total this year to just
over £4500. The reason that we were
unable to comment on this figure is
that no-one from Felix bothered to
ask!
Secondly, the Dirty Disco. Rag
assisted with this event, providing the
float, some of the publicity and mak-
ing all of the bookings for the Disco.
We asked the R S M U on several occa-
sions whether they required any more
assitance, and were assured that no
more help was required. We eagerly
await a receipt for the proceeds, as
promised.
[...] Rag are as strong as ever and
will keep doing what we do best —
collecting money for the sick, home-
less and needy. It is a shame we do
not have your support.
Yours sincerely
Jon Lambert, Rag Chair
Mark Harrison, Rag Treasurer
Bollocks did nobody ask how much
you'd raised so far — the reason we
couldn't put in a figure was that
when we talked to you, no-one could
tell us.
Ribbons
Dear Rachel,
I was very disappointed to see
that Felix 1043 on 1st December did
not pay more attention to World Aids
Day. There are, as I'm sure you're
aware, still a lot of myths about H I V
and AIDS which your paper could
have helped dispel with an article
about how H I V is contracted and
spread, and what can be done to pre-
vent it [...]
Too many people think of H I V
and AIDS as being 'someone elses
problem'. It isn't. It will not go away
if ignored. It is here amongst us. The
only way at present to combat it is to
educate everyone in safer sex prac-
tices. Felix provides an ideal medium
to get the message across to people
who aren't going to pick up a safer sex
leaflet somewhere. I hope, in the not
too distant future, you will publish an
article, to which I would be only to
happy to contribute.
Yours sincerely,
Nigel Russell MED
I couldn't agree more, and eagerly
await your contribution... though on
reading your letter one resident Felix
wag announced that A I D S day isn't
relevant to Imperial because no one
has sex here.
Non-dedicated
Reader
Dear Felix,
I am not a dedicated reader of
your "student newspaper", but it
often provides light entertainment of
a Friday morning. I have noticed the
higher standard of the content this
year over last and have been struck by
a scattering of surprisingly diverse
and interesting articles. Imagine my
dismay then to find the majority of
issue 1042 devoted to an adolescent
and frankly boring discussion of
drugs; ecstasy in particular. For good-
ness' sake G R O W U P !
The articles seemed to make out
that IC was some kind of drugs haven
or opium den. Call me naive if you
like (you'd be wrong) but I really can-
not believe that IC has a major drugs
problem, if indeed any drugs problem
at all. Where IC's problem lies is in
the large proportion of narrow mind-
ed fools who seem to think that using
drugs is about being 'cool'. O f course
I'm not saying that this problem is
exclusive to IC but think about it; if
you did a survey asking people what
types of drugs they had tried or reg-
ularly used, I think you could be jus-
tified in interpreting the results for
dope use (and similarly for other
types of drug) as follows:
1) People who have tried dope =
people who know someone who has.
2) People who regularly use dope =
people who use it when their broth-
er's dodgy mate offers it to them.
3) People who use it daily = people
who buy and use it occasionally.
One columnist claimed that he
had spoken to an IC dealer. Maybe,
but I wouldn't be surprised if this
'dealer' was just someone who once
sold some stale weed to a mate. You
see, people who use dope and other
drugs because they E N J O Y them and
especially those who sell them don't
tend to show off about it and make a
song and dance.
So come on Felix, please don't bore
us with such fashionnable discourses
on drug use, especially if it is done in
such an unprofessional way.
Rupert Ingham
Civ Eng.
If a Felix reporter writes about hav-
ing spoken to a dealer, it is most like-
ly that it is because they have, in fact,
just spoken to a dealer, and not 'just
someone who once sold some stale
weed to a mate'. If however you wish
to delude yourself otherwise then
feel free to do so. Our job is merely
to bring information to you, and if
you choose to ignore it and carry on
spouting your own ill-informed ideas
then that is your prerogative. We can
give you the facts, but we can't force
you to think about them. O n anoth-
er note, your equation 'people who
have tried dope = people who know
someone who has' simply implies
that people who have tried dope are
people who know someone who has;
a foregone conclusion, surely. Thus,
M r Ingham, you reveal yourself not
only to be small minded, arrogant
and (despite your protestations)
naive, but a poor logician as well.

fatigue
Thanks to an inordinate num-
ber of letters this week I have been
relegated to a rather small corner:
jolly good really. It's almost
Christmas, and quite frankly Felix is
looking forward to a quiet few days
eating turkey and doing little else.
After a week when one employee of
the Imperial College Union Print
Unit managed to get taken to hospi-
tal with concussion and the other
came down with a rather peculiar
skin disease, quite frankly we're all
in need of a few days to put our feet
up...
happy happy joy joy
Which leaves me only to wish you
all a rather jolly Christmas and ask
that no one gets too offended by the
not at all serious felixed bit. A l l in
the best possible taste. A very big
thank you to everybody that's con-
tributed this term, with a special
note of appreciation to the
Conservative Society for making it
all so much fun. Thank you very
much for the Christmas card - it
was very touching, although perhaps
the lipstick on the envelope wasn't
strictly necessary, boys...
