film: the shooterpooky
In an attempt to break out of his tough-guy-with-
no-brains image Dolph Lundgren stars in this
lame political European thriller. He plays a US
Federal Marshal sent to Prague to extradite
Simone Rosset (Maruschka Detmers), an ex-
political assassin, who the CIA believe bumped
off the Cuban Ambassador to America. Dolph,
however, doesn't think she did it but reluctantly
agrees to go after her. After several chase
sequences he manages to catch her and learns
she is being set up as the scape-goat for another
assassination at the Cuban-American summit in
Prague. Consequently they must dodge both
sides in an attempt to stop the assassination.
Unfortunately the film far too quickly
becomes formulaic with the final twist being
obvious from the first few scenes. There was a
chance to make a taut European political thriller
but instead the film opts for indistinctive action
sequences. There was the chance for some inter-
esting development of the personality crisis as
the Marshal returns to his childhood town, but
all possibility of this was lost by casting Dolph
Lundgren - the man who makes stone seem
charismatic.
The film would have benefited from a more
European style instead of the banal Hollywood
one. Ultimately The Shooter fires blanks and
amounts to notiting out of the ordinary (the
American ordinary).
film: dr jekyll andms hyde™^
The ultimate battle of the sexes, or excuse to see
a man in womans' clothing? No, just another
predictable film jazzed up using special effects.
Dr Richard Jacks just happens to be the great-
grandson of the infamous Dr Jekyll, and when he
inherits his Victorian ancestors notebooks he
winds up dabbling in the human genome. In an
attempt to alter the aggression gene for Dr Jacks
metamorphoses instead into a woman.
Rapidly inflating breast, disappearing penis,
longer hair and finger nails are the least of Dr
Jacks problems when his alter ego Helen Hyde
decides to take over his life andjob. However Dr
Jacks life is not what you would call ideal, his
work at a perfume company, creating stxmning
smells, is stagnant and he is so consumed by his
home experiments that his fiancee Sarah
(Lysette Anthony) needs little persuasion to
leave him. Helen, on the other hand, uses her
sexuality and other natural assets to climb up
through the ranks of the perfume company.
This film is predictable, as it is obvious Dr
Jacks is going to change into a woman in a public
place at the wrong time and Helen into a man
when she is just about to seduce someone. There
are some funny moments in the film but that
goes for all bad comedies. Everyone knows the
original Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde and this spoof
only goes down with a pinch of salt, or a pinch of
salt, lime and several tequilas.
