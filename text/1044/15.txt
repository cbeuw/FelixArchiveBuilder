Seven whats? Dwarves? Definitely not, Seven is
about the seven deadly sins - gluttony, greed,
sloth, envy, wrath, pride and lust - and a serial
killer who makes his mark by murdering
culpritsof these sins. Is he cleansing a society full
of sins or is hejust another madman and a master
of murder? Seven is frightening and disturbing
and very hard to forget.
When the first body, a man who had been
force fed until his stomach popped, is found, Lt.
William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) and
Detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) are teamed up
and placed on the investigation. Somerset is an
ageing cop on the verge of retiring, and embarks
on his last assignment to break-in his replace-
ment, Mills, and to solve these murders.
Somerset just wants to retire: he has faced the
fact that one man can't make a difference, but
his old instincts tell him that this murder is just
the start of something larger. This attitude
conflicts with Mills style of investigation, as Mills
is prepared to forsake anything to track down
this deranged killer. Somerset is a thinking man
who tries to outwit his opponent.
Seven goes out of its way to shock the audi-
ence; the murders are gruesome and deeply
disturbing, to the extent that the film will linger
in my mind for a few days. Seven wasfilmedin
a way that expressed a feeling of depression and
decay in this metropolis, the dark world that
John Doe, the killer, apparently wants to cleanse.
The use of the NYPD Blues shaky cam adds to
the chase scenes when the officers seem close to
John Doe., and the build up to the discovery of
another body. However, as the film murders on,
Somerset and Mills discover that great planning
has gone into these killings and that John Doe is
pure evil.
The story line is thoroughly absorbing and
the finale maintains the dark, foreboding feel of
the film. Both performances from Freeman and
Pitt are excellent. Freeman again plays a veteran
character with his old ways and wiseman aura,
while Pitt just shows maturity.
Seven will stir emotions, and in parts your
stomach too. Well worth checking out.

The Swan Princess is an animated film from
Rich Animal Studios which is based on the
German fairy tale Swan Lake.
The story begins with King William and
Queen Uberta arranging meetings every
summer between the king's daughter Princess
Odette and the queen's son Prince Derek (not a
great name for a prince it has to be said) in the
hope that they will fall in love and marry.
When the prince and princess grow up, they
do fall in love. Odette wants Derek to marry her
because he loves her for who she is not just
because she's beautiful. Being a typical man,
Derek cannot express such sentiments to her
even though he does love her. Disappointed,
Odette leaves.
On the way home from the prince's palace,
she is captured by Rothbart (voice supplied by
Jack Palance), an evil sorcerer who wants to take
over King William's kingdom. He keeps Odette
prisoner deep in the forests and turns her into a
swan. The spell is broken temporarily when
moonlight falls on her wings but the only way
she can break the spell forever is if she agrees to
marry Rothbart or if Derek makes a vow of true
love.
In the forest, Odette meets and makes
friends with a trio of well-voiced and endearing
characters: Jean-Bob (John Cleese), afrogwith a
French accent; Speed the turtle and Puffin the
er... puffin.
The Swan Princess is a competent imitation
of the Disney formula. It is peppered with ener-
getic tunes although these are a bit too suaiilar to
stick in the mind for long. The animation is
smooth and well drawn even if it is not nearly as
impressive as the Disney greats.
The story has many ingredients to impress
the under nines: an evil sorcerer; a handsome
prince and a beautiful princess. Not only will The
Swan Princess succeed in keeping children's
attention but also, it will entertain the grown-ups
accompanying them over the holiday period.
