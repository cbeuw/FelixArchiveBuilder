ICU Bid For BMS Books
BY DIPAK G H O S H
Imperial College Union hope to
move their bookstore to the
ground floor of the library as part
of the expansion of the South
Kensington campus brought
about by the Basic Medical
Sciences building. The space
vacated by the move will be used
to expand the selection of sta-
tionary sold in the present site.
Plans for the library include
adding two more floors on top of
the present building and an
enlargement of the basement for
storage. Latest designs for the
BMS bookstore allocate 224 m2
of floor space, whilst the remain-
ing area will be occupied by the
entrance to the library and the
Haldane collection.
There are, however, many
technical difficulties with the
bookstore are yet to be resolved,
highlighted by Matt Crompton,
Deputy President for Finance
and Services. "The bidding to
decide who runs the bookstore is
not yet open. Moreover, the
College has yet to appoint a com-
mittee that can consider applica-
tions from bidders; the criteria
for deciding who runs the book-
store have yet to be finalised." It
is widely thought that potential
bidders, apart from ICU, are
likely to include Blackwells and
Dillons.
Mr Crompton commented
that ICU would naturally like to
run this bookstore because it will
be better run and more account-
able to students. Asked to
expand on this claim, he said "at
the moment the bookstore com-
mittee runs the union bookstore,
and this has student representa-
tives and sabbaticals on it. If our
bid for the BMS bookstore is
accepted then this set-up will
continue to be used. We will
keep prices down whereas the
others would be run to make
profits."
RH Deny Their Ruggery
BY AAARK BRIDGE
The Union's lost welcome mat
"miraculously" turned up at
Royal Holloway's Clubs and
Societies Officer Shams Sadek's
office late last week.
The mat was bundled from
Beit Quad in the small hours of
Thursday November 16th as
union stewards were clearing the
midweek sports crowd from Da
Vinci's. Many IC clubs had invit-
ed their opponents over after
their British Universities' Sports
Association matches with Royal
Holloway. Security footage clear-
ly shows an unidentified Royal
Holloway student entering the
Union followed subsequently by
a huddle of RH sportsmen carry-
ing one of their drunken compa-
triots out, with the mat, into a
waiting silver minibus.
Speaking to Felix, Mr Sadek
was in.dally quite genial, howev-
er, when questioned about who
had actually booked their silver
minibus on the night it was seen
outside Beit, he quickly became
very hostile and aggressively cut
off the call with 'I havn't got
time for this, [and] don't call
back...' When attempts were
made to contact other RH Union
officials, Mr Sadek consistently
intercepted the communications
and further clarification of his
role was not possible, suggesting
acute embarrassment at Royal
Holloway Union over the rug
snatch.
Sarah White said that she
and Clubs and Societies
Sabbatical Tim Townend would
be travelling to Royal Holloway
to retrieve the mat within the
next few days. 'I don't care
where or how it was found, it's
just found' she commented. The
incident caused Sarah White
considerable embarrassment at
the time because she was at the
gate as the students walked by
with the mat.
Suicides Rise Blamed on Financial Stress
BY ANDY SINHARAY
A report published by Liberal
Democrat MP Don Foster has
shown an eightfold increase in
student suicides over the last
decade, a period which has seen a
doubling of the student popula-
tion.
Entitled "A report on the
level of student stress and suicide
rates" it emphasises that it repre-
sents "merely a 'dip' into a very
complex field" and that it is "by
no means an authorative survey."
However the report does show
that "a large number of students
who took their own life were,
according to the information we
have received, scientists", also
indicating that since 1993 men
appeared more likely to take
their own lives than women, with
mature students being "especially
vulnerable".
Sarah White, ICU president,
commented that "it highlights
concern that the recent expan-
sion of student numbers in many
HE colleges, polys and 'new' uni-
versities, has not been matched
by an equivalent expansion in stu-
dent support services." She
added, "the main factor is
undoubtedly financial worries."
ICU Welfare Officer, Stephen
Webb, agreed: "I also note that
the male suicide rate is consider-
ably higher than that for females
amongst students, and that in the
male dominated atmosphere of
IC, men are less likely to seek
counselling. There is perhaps a
tendency to assume that males
have no specific problems."
IC's own student counsellor,
Don Adlington, emphasised that
there was not necessarily a dis-
tinct connection between stress,
be it academic or financial, and
suicide for an individual student.
Although he felt that students
had "a slightly less secure base
then there used to be" financially
and otherwise, he did feel that
statistically there probably was a
link "Suicide is a different phe-
nomenon to depression," he said,
"there are some students [under
stress] who would never commit
suicide in a hundred years... it
depends on personality."
Although suicides have
occurred at Imperial in recent
years, he felt that welfare provi-
sion at Imperial was adequate,
and that such incidents could
well have been down to a lack of
communication. "Some do slip
through the net, but I encourage
staff to refer students to me." He
further added that the system of
pastoral care and personal tutori-
als operating at the moment was
fairly successful, and was indeed
better than that offered at other
establishments.
