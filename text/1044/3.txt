NEWS FELIX WEDNESDAY DECEMBER 1 3TH 1995 . THREE
Medics Meet Match in Deputy Rector
BY DIPAK G H O S H
Student concerns over the Basic
Medical Sciences project have
been rejected by the Deputy
Rector, Prof John Archer, as
groundless, prompting medical
students to form an action group
to oppose the current plans. The
student bodies most closely
involved are worried that their
views have not been taken seri-
ously and that the planning com-
mittee has tried to exclude them
from the decision making
process.
The concerns were set out in
to a document titled 'Student
Concern Regarding the BMS
Building', which was submitted
to the Deputy Rector and all the
potential occupants of the BMS
on 21 November 1995. The stu-
dent representatives of Imperial
College, St Mary's Hospital
Medical School and Charing
Cross and Westminster Medical
School all formally backed the
move.
The document highlights
particular problems regarding the
proposed provisions of "student
social and recreational facilities"
(SRF); from the most recent set
of plans for the BMS, the space
for SRF has been reduced from
826 m2
to just over 300 m2
. This
social space will not be large
enough to accoommodate the
new Imperial College School of
Medicine (ICSM), estimated to
be 1000 new students and 400
staff.
The Deputy Rector respond-
ed to this document on the 29
November in the form of a letter
to Sarah White, the ICU
President. It says that while the
total number of students that will
join us from all the institutions
will 'not change dramatically', we
will need to utilise all the medical
colleges' sites, as well as
Silwood. He also claims that the
BMS will have substantial stu-
dent and recreational space, but
warns that 'at South Kensington
we have to balance against the
available space, the desire to
establish first class facilities in
teaching and research, as well as
social space.'
The students' document of
concern suggests specific areas
which need to be addressed with
regard to projected numbers of
student and staff that will occupy
the BMS, including the restau-
rant, sports, bar and common
room areas. The student bodies
appealed to the Deputy Rector to
reconsider, and since construc-
tion does not start until mid
February 1996, they reassure him
that it is not too late to change
the internal compartmentalisa-
tion of the building. The student
unions pledge their support to
making ICSM 'the best in the
country' but they believe it can-
not attract the 'desired calibre of
students as well as academic and
research staff if it does not have
"attractive" SRF.
The document claims that
they are not aware of plans for
extending the present library
facilities and the proposed expan-
sion of sports facilities. They also
claim that the existing bars will
be 'unable to cope and would
potentially represent a fire haz-
ard' and that a bar within the
BMS would serve to reduce the
pressure on present facilities,
especially with ICU's move to
the Sherfield building in doubt.
They also seek reassurance for
the proposed book shop on the
ground floor of the present
library.
In his reply, Prof Archer
details plans for expansion of
sports and catering facilities for

Digging for the future: an army of contractors descended on the site
of the RCS II building, condemned to demolition to make way for
the new Basic Medical Sciences block. They are under the hire of
Schal International, the company brought in by Imperial College to
oversee the construction of the BMS.
Last ditch attempts to find a buyer for the antique interior of
the lecture theatres, often used as settings in period dramas, have
been unsuccessful. They are now likely to be cleared away with the
rest of the building in time for construction to start in mid February
next year.
the whole community, but warns
that while the new BMS building
will contain social space for stu-
dent activities, 'it is not intended
to serve as a major restaurant'.
The Deputy Rector goes onto
reassure Miss White that the stu-
dent's views are represented
through 'well established lines of
communication', including the
House and Estates Committee as
well as the BMS Planning
Committee. He also claims that
the ICU gave their support to the
strategic sign-off of the plan at
the end of the summer.
Miss White agrees that there
is good line of communication
between ICU and. the various
committees, but complains that
they do not listen to their views.
She also said that the House
Committee tend to talk more
about immediate issues concern-
ing IC but not issues relating to
the BMS, because the plans have
not yet been finalised. Refuting
the part of Professor Archer's
reply which stated that ICU had
signed the agreement on the
plans at the end of the summer,
she said that it was not signed by
her, nor was she aware of it being
signed on her behalf.
Expanding on the concerns
raised in the document Miss
White said that "there is not even
enough space for students to dis-
cuss issues arising out of a lec-
ture." She claims that ICU gave
no full backing for the plan and
they have not bothered to ask
what they think. Moreover "they
[the medical school planning
committee] seem to have
arranged this sign-off meeting
when none of us could attend
maybe because we had objections
to the plans".
However, she endorses the
aim of this project and believes
that this will undoubtedly be an
"outstanding" medical college,
but goes on to warn that if the
SRF is not reviewed then medics
may go to other sites in the BMS,
so it will not fulfil the aim of inte-
grating students from Imperial
and the medical colleges.
