Royal Albert Hall Looks Back to the
Future for Science and Arts
BY BEN WILKINS
The Albert Hall, traditional-
ly a venue for opera and pop con-
certs, may be reverting to its orig-
inal purpose- a centre for the pro-
motion of science and the arts.
This March, the RAH will be cel-
ebrating its 125th anniversary.
In the run up to the celebra-
tions, one of the new initiatives is
the setting up of an Arts and
Science study group. The group
will be looking at the hall's main
objectives in the first quarter of
the 21st century and is currently
gathering ideas for how the venue
could be used to promote sci-
ence.
When Prince Albert leased
the Kensington site in 1852, his
plan was to build an institution to
promote "Scientific and artistic
knowledge as applicable to pro-
ductive industry". The building
was completed in 1871 and for
the first few decades, science lec-
tures were very popular, drawing
up 9000 visitors. In 1933 Albert
Einstein and Ernest Rutherford
gave a lecture to raise funds for
refugees from Nazi Germany.
Unfortunately, subsequent to
Einstein's appearance, there were
no more science events at the site
until quite recently.
However, it seems public
interest in science is on the
increase. Last month, at the Hall,
Professor Stephen Hawking gave
his lecture "Does God Throw
Dice in Black Holes?" (see right).
Over 5000 people came to see
him, and outside, touts sold tick-
ets on the pavement.
Hawking's First Words in Jeopardy?
"Can you hear me?" was his
first sentence. Hawking's elec-
tronic, metallic sounding voice
was made even more unearthly
by the Royal Albert Hall's echo-
ing acoustics. Hawking himself
looked a very diminished figure.
"He seemed like he was asleep
half the time" commented one
member of the audience. His talk
though, was engaging and enter-
taining.
He discussed determinism,
saying he had proved mathemati-
cally that it was impossible to
predict the future perfectly. His
idea is that there may be millions
of tiny black holes in the universe
no bigger than a pin prick. When
a black hole evaporates, the
information about any objects
which may have fallen into it will
be irretrievably lost. It follows
that it would be impossible to
calculate the course of the
future, even if we had all the
information about the present.
At the end of the lecture,
Hawking answered ten selected
questions, including "Is time
travel possible". His answer was
"Not for objects as large and
complex as humans", comment-
ing that he would be unhappy if
it was possible, because then
someone might go back in time
and kill his parents before he was
born.
