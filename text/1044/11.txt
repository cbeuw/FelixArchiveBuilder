It's easy to be cynical about Bush. Firstly; there's
the name. Okay, so they're from Shepherd's
Bush, but you don't get bands who live near
Brown Willy hill in Cornwall calling themselves...
well, you get the picture.
Then there's the
music. London lads who
sound like Soundgarden
reviving the spirit of
Nirvana and then claim •
that the only reason for
the similarity is because
Kurt loved the Pixies like
they do. As if.
And then there's the
lyrics. We get nonsensical, f/^
pseudo-intellectual state-
ments ("There's no sex in
your violence" -
'Everything Zen') and a
contender for the worst
lyric of all time in 'little
Things': "I touch your
mouth, my willy for food." (And I think that
that's quite enough willy references, thank you.)
Yet, despite the invective above, I just can't
be cynical about Bush. The fact is that they have
released one of the best albums of the year
('Sixteen Stone'), that the two aforementioned
songs with the dodgy lyrics are perhaps the two
best singles of the year, that they're flying the flag
for British rock music across the water by selling
over two million copies of their debut LP, that the
LA2 is tonight packed way past its suffocation
limit, and that they put on an excellent live show.
As he walks on stage, mainman Gavin
Rossdale surveys the lake of already sweaty, main-
I H H f l H ly teenage faces and says,
TB hall to himself, "Welcome
home." The band then
proceed to play a set that
veers from the good to the
great, from causing crowd
I histrionics to crowd hyste-
• ria. The likes of 'Monkey',
'Swim', and the mon-
strously anthemic
'Comedown' are played
I with a confidence and
positive swagger that
befits a band retairning to a
home that was once bar-
ren territory but is now
I bearing the fruits of adula-
tion.
They finish with a rocked up cover of REM's
'The One I Love' and manage to get away with it.
But then they could have gotten away with just
about anydiing tonight. 'Little Things' - don't
make me laugh. It's probably only great things
that lie in this band's path. Just sort those lyrics
out, lads.

Oh dear. For some years now, Roddy Frame of
Aztec Camera has been hailed as one of the best
songwriters of his generation. He reigned
supreme in the Eighties with his jangly, guitar-rid-
den pop. He's been out of the frame recendy (I
know, it s a poor joke, but it is the end of term)
and on the basis of this album, I'm not surprised.
'Frestonia' sounds like Aztec Camera, which
may well be the problem. It seems that whilst
we've all got older and moved on, Roddy is stuck
in die same place as he was ten years ago. Easy lis-
tening it is, good contemporary pop it is not.
There are a couple of tracks that pull them-
selves from the mire, namely the opener 'Sun'
(and its acoustic version 'Sunset') and 'Method of
Love' with its late Beatles-type sound.
Unfortunately, the rest of the tracks are a collec-
tion of dreary MOR ballads that glide along inof-
fensively until, before you know it, the album is
over and you're left thinking, "Is that it?"
It's possibly time to tell Aztec Camera (and
coundess others) that they have to stop churning
out music based on the same old ideas, and should
look forward. This does not appeal to those of us
who appreciate a bit of innovation in our music. I
would advise you to avoid this album unless you
have run out of ideas for a Christmas present for
your Aunty. (4)

So, we finally get to hear the combination of the
awe inspiring axe-wielding genius that is Bernard
Buder, formerly of Suede, and some bloke who
used to be in a lousy band called the Thieves and
can sing a bit.
'The Sound of...' gives the boys a little more
scope for development than the two excellent sin-
gles, and yes, part of that sentence was preten-
tious nonsense. This development is basically the
whole of the last two EPs with a few extra tracks
thrown in and it takes a few listens, I can tell you.
After that it really gets its claws in and holds on.
'The Right Thing' starts as is if it was plagia-
rised from Suede's 'Dogman Star' and 'Don't
Call It Soul' shows that Bernard can play acoustic
as well. 'Disappointment' is an infectious romp,
but 'The Debtor' doesn't quite make the grade.
I get the impression that sometimes Mr.
Mc
Almont and Mr. Buder are playing two differ-
ent tracks, what with the singing not quite fitting
in with the sublime guitar playing. But, when the
two do get it right, (witness 'You do', 'Yes' and
'Tonight'), the plot is most definitely found and
given redemption at the same time.
So, wasted talent or Siamese subliminity??
The sound of McAlmont (6). The sound of
Butler (10). The weighted sound of McAlmont
and Butler (7).
