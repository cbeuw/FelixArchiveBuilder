Virgins Satisfied
V I R G I N S 5 - 0 BART'S
With the return of Shiner Evans
from injury IC Virgins played to
their strengths in their first
league match, showing last
week's defeat at the hands of the
Vet College to be a mere aberra-
tion.
IC started in confident fash-
ion with the forwards obtaining
good ball from the scrums allow-
ing the backs opportunities to
make ground through intelligent
running. The back line was well
organised despite all but the
scrum-half playing in unfamiliar
positions.
Tackling was of a high stan-
dard throughout the game, and
running from the forwards most
impressive. The only score of the
game came from Evans, a superb
solo effort, in which she covered
nearly half the pitch after receiv-
ing the ball at fly half.
The score would have been
even more in IC's favour had it
not been for some handling
errors in vital situations.
Overall though, a vast
improvement on the disaster
that was the last game, demon-
strating the importance of team-
work and commitment.

RSM seem to be playing some
good football these days. Despite
their first team's admittedly
lucky win over LSE, the seconds
move from strength to strength.
Not content with a 4-0 tri-
umph over fellow C C U side St
Mary's, they went on to thrash
St Georges by a mighty six goals
to one on Saturday.
This match included a fif-
teen minute hat trick from man
of the match Mark, who added
his fourth goal just ten minutes
later.
Despite an attempted come-
back on the second half, there
was no way that IC would let
them back into the game, and
emerged worthy winners.

R C S R U F C 3 - 3 W C F B
With all the other college Rugby
matches cancelled due to the
snow, we were thoroughly
delighted (honestly, we were)
when our skipper informed us
that our match at Northolt,
against the Western Command
Fire Brigade was still on.
Kicking off in the middle of
a blizzard, three inches of snow,
and a 'swirly-whirly-wind', we
face the daunting prospect of a
Samoan-sized front row and a
distinctly French-looking three-
quarter back line. Fortunately
for us, the arctic blasts of wind
halted our opposition in their
tracks, and a powerful pack per-
formance in the second half saw
IC ahead by 3-0. Despite our
dedicated defending though, we
were unable to hold the firemen
out for ever, and a penalty in the
dying minutes levelled the
match.

Win
I C A F C II 4 - 1 U C L II
This league fixture began as a bit
of a grudge match after IC came
back from 5-1 down to win 6-5
in the cup earlier this season.
Both teams made a positive start
with Ike Ombala scoring for
Imperial after a powerful run
into the box. His second came
from the penalty spot after He
was brought down en route to
goal. After a sustained period of
pressure, UCL pulled a goal back
just before half time; this pres-
sure continued after the break,
until Ike Ombala's third strike
finished the game off- again
from the penalty spot, this time
sending the goalkeeper the
wrong way. A fourth was soon
added when Ike's run and square
pass set up a simple chance for
Rob Ochola. UC fought hard,
but some stout defence, notably
from Will Scott, safeguarded the
scoreline.
Sports News
Sunderland AFC moved to the top
of the Endsleigh League Division One
after a sensational six-nil win over that
morning's leaders Milwall. Craig Russell
scored four goals.
Mike Atherton's unbeaten 198 was
hailed as one of the greatest innings of all
time, enabling England's cricketers to
snatch a draw from the jaws of defeat.
C & G Rally Around
Due to bad planning and a
complete absence of any com-
mon sense our first rally took
place in December. The starting
field of seven was quickly whit-
tled down, with 'Devil's Elbow'
taking its inevitable toll on one
racer, whilst dozing off behind
the wheel was the source of
another's demise. I got to the
end and waited for the winner to
arrive, only to find myself diving
out of the way of Steve Barnes'
2CV, which powerslid across the
line almost completely under
control. Road-rage-heaven, man!
