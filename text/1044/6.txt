News Review: Autumn 1995

Felix 1034: Tripping
Freshers tripping merrily into
South Ken were accosted with
the tale of a stone lion called
*• A AA «
I
S^^^AS4-IAA^^Ak'Sfe
'Reggie' tripping back to KCL.
The RCSU, having unburdened
KCL of their mascot last term,
repatriated Reggie, though with-
out the traditional charity dona-
tion. RCSU president Mo Dulloo
said he wasn't entirely happy
with the situation. Not unlike
Sarah White, "extremely cross"
with the College's minimalist
approach to discussion on the
Sherfield move. There was a
spate of burglaries in Clayponds;
a spate of vandalism in Princes
Gardens (after the security barri-
er got, well, vandalised), and a
spate of building projects every-
where else.
Felix 1035: Extreme
Freshers tripping merrily in
Freshers Fair may also been
accosted by the non-IC Islamic
group Hizb-ut-Tahrir. The org-
anisation, accused of extremism
started exhibiting outside Beit
Arch without the permission of
ICU, who called the police.
Extremism of a different kind
was reported by Time Out mag-
azine, highlighting IC as having
a drink problem. This was
denied (vociferously, of course)
by Sabbaticals and the Pro-
Rector, Alan Swanson, saying
only a tiny number of students
were affected. And College
finally condescended to consult
ICU over the Sherfield move...
Felix 1036: Bent Over
One Fresher tripped maybe too
merrily to a Rag event only to end
up sprawled on the Sherfield
walkway, with allegations that
perhaps offering free spirits to
students wasn't such a good idea.
DP(F&S) Matt Crompton had
approved the event, so long as
Rag were aware of licensing rules.
Richard Willis' actions were said
to be "highly commendable" and
"new students were not encour-
aged to over-indulge". Was he
really responsible? Was Rag fail-
ing in its duty to stop students
getting drunk? Was Time Out
really that far wrong? Meanwhile,
IC Boat Club was exchanging
broadsides with Putney residents,
who were concerned that
extending the boat house would
destroy the local area. Sports
manager Frank Murray said that
IC was "bending over backwards"
to meet wishes of the locals.
DP(C&S) Tim Townend was
unsympathetic: "If they live on a
river, what do they expect?"
Felix 1037: Batterings
Visits, visits everywhere and lots
and lots to drink. Princess Anne
came to ElecEng to open a lab,
and Bernard Jenkin MP came to
visit the much maligned
ConSoc. Drink: not so much
booze but the controversy it was
still generating (Are you listen-
ing, Time Out?) The once
"highly commendable" Richard
Willis was accused of "irrespon-
sible actions" with speculation
rife over his disciplinary hearing.
One of his supporters planned a
motion of no-confidence in
ICU's exec, believing Richard to
be experiencing needless batter-
ings from too many people. Not
unlike the entry barrier on
Watt's Way, vandalised three
times in as many weeks.
Felix 1038: Sheffield
With Richard appealing over the
disciplinary and a spate of bike
thefts around college, it seemed
that ICU may not be moving to
Sherfield after all (or Sheffield as
the RCSU would us believe).
Aside from there being a union
who were none too fond of the
idea Estates Director, Ian
Caldwell, said that "the costs
appear to be higher than we feel
comfortable with". Miguel Port-
a-loo visited ConSoc (according
to the Labour Club). Portillo's
visit passed off with surprisingly
good behaviour from both stu-
dents and speaker.
Felix 1039: Baffling
Police were unexpected invitees
to the Halloween party after fire
alarms set Linstead and
Southside residents rioting dur-
ing the night. Linstead Bar was
consequently shut, baffling
many as most of the student
drinking supposedly took place
in Southside. Fire alarms were
also giving hall residents
unpleasant wake-up calls amidst
criticisms that they were sub-
standard.
Felix 1040: Escape
Physicists fumed over a smoking
ban in their department, with no
space allowed for them to light
up. Hope had however lit up for
Linstead Bar, with Pro-Rector
Prof Swanson deciding that the
closure decision had been a bit
rash. The RCSU got afflicted
with more than the usual defi-
ciencies with the resignation of
their VP and the (threaetened)
loss of their office. A consider-
ably more serious loss occurred
after a Rowing Club boat broke in
half during training, though its
crew swam to safety: "We were
lucky to escape with our lives,"
said one of the escapees. Maybe,
but...
Felix 1041: Torpedoed
...thy were to be well and truly
sunk after no less an eminence as
David Mellor MP torpedoed
their plans for their clubhouse
development, with the Borough's
planning commmittee throwing
out the scheme. Mellor said he
was "delighted that the balance...
between the interests of the
locals is not to be destabilised."
Back at ConSoc, John Gummer
faced questions on topics from
pollution to privatisation. Petty
crime was also in evidence (else-
where). The Clayponds Estate
was hit by more burglaries, and
ICU was hit by the theft of its
front doormat. The Conference
centre was hit by impending clo-
sure, and Richard Willis was hit
by defeat, losing his appeal
against disciplinary punishment
and facing a £75 fine.
Felix 1042: Witch
Theft remained a problem, and
freshers could now trip in anoth-
er sense after it emerged that IC
students could now obtain ecsta-
sy with surprising ease. Chris
Smith MP was merely doing IT
at LabSoc, talking to the club
about the information super-
highway. Linstead's now leg-
endary Halloween party saw the
tribunal (witch-hunt?) of a re-
app take place.
Felix 1043: Bumper
A bumper crop of thefts contin-
ued to rock IC as Olave and
Linstead Halls were hit. Other
burglaries included exam candi-
dates of their own calculators
under new regulations, and chari-
ties of their earnings as as it
emerged that Rag week hadn't
been quite the money spinner it
was planned to be. Sarah White
looks less cross, though.
