The Albums that made 1995
After much head-scratching, the votes from the Felix music team are in. So
and relax. You are mtering a Blur and Oasis-free zone.
1. Radiohead - 'The Bends'
They turned up in half of the top 5 lists and-
earned themselves the prestigious Felix
album of the year award by many a mile.
Some might say that they now have nothing
left to achieve. Then again...
"Radiohead's strength lies in their ability to
lead you unsuspectingly down a sleepy path
and then lob in a grenade..." [Felix 1025)
2. Pulp - 'Different Class'
After twelve years of snail-like progress, Jarvis and
the crew finally made it big. 'Common People',
'Misshapes', 'Disco 2000' - you bought them, you
know them, you love them.
"Jarvis uses his lyrics to drag the listener into every
song... This album kicks all of the recent
'Britpop™ albums into touch." (rT
eZi%1040)
3.= Chemical Bros. - 'Exit Planet Dust'
They were the Dust Brothers, then they became,
the Chemical Brothers. Thankfully their music
didn't change and the duo who have remixed just
about every band under the sun finally allowed us
to sample some of their sampling on their own
record. "The Brothers gonna work it out..."
('Leave Home') They sure did.

3.= Supergrass - 'I Should Coco'
They may look like extras from Planet Of The
Apes but you saw more in them than just evolu-
tionary significance. Yes, the Oxford whippersnap-
pers won your hearts over with such catchy ditties
as 'Caught By The Fuzz', 'Mansize Rooster',
'Lenny', and the monster hit, 'Alright'. A debut
album bulging at the seams with singles, in other
words.
5. Tricky - 'Maxinquaye'
The most talented Bristol artist of them all. This is-
an angry record that, instead of ranting like a spoilt
brat, articulates its message with a breadth of
musical emotions. 'Hell Waits Round the Corner'
sounds just like that while 'Black Steel' is a bold
and brilliant version of the Public Enemy classic.
And anyone who can cover Public Enemy and
come away with dignity intact has got to be good.
