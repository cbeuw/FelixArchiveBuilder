IC Loses £2 Million
In Tory Budget Cuts

Higher Education capital spend-
ing cuts of over 31% announced
in last month's budget could have
far reaching consequences for
Imperial College. College offi-
cials were quick to condemn the
slashing of Universities' budgets,
which could see IC up to £2 mil-
lion a year poorer, raising the
spectre of top-up fees for stu-
dents.
Kenneth Clarke's budget
proposals were labelled a case of
'robbing Peter to pay Paul' by
angry universities who are bitter
that the government has cut hun-
dreds of millions from the Higher
Education Funding Council for
England's budget to give £878
million more to primary and sec-
ondary education. It was pointed
out as being particularly ironic
that Gillian Shephard was trum-
peting the sidewards shift of
money as an advance in education
funding.
The Committee of Vice-
Chancellors and Principals met
last Friday to discuss a response
to what one vice-chancellor de-
scribed as "an act of vandalism
bereft of any strategic direction".
The fiery meeting refused to
receive the speech from the edu-
cation minister, Eric Forth, and
threatened to reduce the number
of student places and charge fees
rather than force staff cuts and
diminishing quality of education
from out-of-date equipment.
Faced with massive reduc-
tions in capital spending, money
which is earmarked for replacing
equipment and renovating build-
ings, many institutions are con-
templating top-up fees. These
would be a levy on students
entering higher education to pay
for their tuition, currently paid
for by the tax-payer. However,
this could also lead to the situa-
tion where only the rich and
those capable of attracting spon-
sors or a scholarship would be
able to go to university.
News that Manchester
University, one of the 'Russell
Group' of powerful institutions
which includes Imperial College,
is seriously considering charging
top-up fees, led the group to con-
vene an emergency meeting last
week. The cuts of £500 per stu-
dent over the next 3 years will

affect some places more than
others. Manchester, for example,
suffered a 10% cut in funding last
year which they achieved with
voluntary redundancies, leaving
them no slack with which to
absorb another 31% drop in
income.
The government's proposals
for Higher Education include the
widening of the Private Finance
Initiative (PFI) to allow educa-
tional institutions to attract pri-
vate sector funding for capital
projects such as new buildings
and research centres. However,
almost all institutions agree that
the PFI cannot be effectively
applied to education. These feel-
ings are typified by those of
Cambridge University, "PFI
requires a guaranteed income...,
which academic buildings do not
provide ...teaching and research
buildings do not bring in a profit."

Budget Cuts to Grants
The November budget brought
gloom to student as the manda-
tory grant was slashed by a fur-
ther 9%. However, luckily for
some, the duty on beer
remained the same. page 2
