osc week
A couple of weeks ago, the annual overseas
week brought a real multicultural feel to the J C R
with over 18 of our societies setting up stands
showing off their respective countries. Apart from
the impressive displays, many stalls had regional
delicacies to sample - gastronomic and musical!
Every year, O S C week gives people the chance to
reacquaint themselves with the overseas societies
they never quite got round to investigating during
freshers week, as well as increasing awareness of
the wealth of cultures represented here at IC.
The event was a huge success. Most of the
overseas societies took part and all provided a
colourful display of their culture. Warm thanks to
all the societies who took part. The Hellenic,
Spanish, Lebanese, Sri-Lankan and Scandinavian
socs also held events, and their discos and dinners
were great successes. Well done!
It's a good omen for International Night
1996, the biggest O S C event of the year, due to
take place on March 1st. Preparations are up and
running...
stoic schedule

xmas carnival
So here it is... Merry Christmas!
With just 2 days to go things are hotting up
for the festivities that make up the I C U Christmas
Carnival, and we're here to give you a final taster
of what exactly will make this event so different to
anything else you've ever seen in the Union.
The most obvious thing will be the decor -
each floor will be themed, using banners, drapes
and lighting to reflect the music being played on it.
We're going to leave the exact details 'til the night
so you can have something to look forward to!
Each room has a different music policy:
starting at the top of the building, the Concert Hall
is dedicated to pure upfront club sounds, with 6
DJs bringing their own top quality dance and a
brilliant light show with 3 colour laser - happening
enough for even the most hardened clubber.
U D H will be transformed into a darkened
Level 3, the Union. Programmes filmed on
alternate Wednesday afternoons include:
The Report News and features review programme
designed to keep students informed enlightened
and entertained.
MovieZone Reviews of all the new film releases
plus all the latest from behind the scenes.
Level 3 Entertainment, games, music and comedy
with absolutely no Paul Daniels. We also film
sports, short films, pub and club reviews and
documentaries amongst other things.
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to
all, especially our members, especially the ones
who've paid their membership. Have a brill
Chrimbo and don't overdo the turkey.
haven for all you swing fans, as the "Sex on the
Beach" crew bring you swing, soul, hip-hop,
calypso and jungle in a room you just won't
recognise and won't want to leave.
Finally, the Pop Tarts are in the Ents Lounge,
with live cabaret from the goldfish-swallowing
Stevie Starr (The Regurgitator), and music from a
5-piece Steel Band, guaranteed to bring a little
sunshine into the bleakest midwinter. Plus 4 hours
of top pop and party sounds for your pleasure.
As if all that wasn't enough, there's also
(weather permitting) a gyroscope, bash-a-rat,
coconut shy, and darts game in the Quad (if it
snows, we'll be ready - well, we'll be moving it all
to the Gym!), and a ski-board simulator in the
Gym.
Put all that together, add a 2am bar (3 o'clock
finish), and you've got the best £6 (or £5 with
Entscard) you're ever likely to spend at Imperial. If
you've not got a ticket, then run to the Union
Office N O W to see if there're any left.
