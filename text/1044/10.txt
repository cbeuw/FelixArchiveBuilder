album: madonna - some-
thing to remembercaroiine
"So much controversy has swirled around my
career... that very little attention ever gets paid to
my music. So... I present to you this collection of
ballads," states Madonna on her latest album,
'Something to Remember'. Excellent, except that
even her diehard fans probably remember her
more for the likes of 'Like a Virgin', 'Into the
Groove', 'La Isla Bonita' and 'like a Prayer' than for
the ballads.
Nevertheless, dais album shows Madonna
doing what she does best - singing (not acting!). 'I
Want You' as first and last song (a faux pas that
you wouldn't expect from Madonna) is a poor
choice and sounds more like something from
Bladerunner. Tilings improve with '111 Remember'
trying to set the scene for an album of classic
Madonna: strong vocals over a decidedly '80s key-
board feel, building to the ultimate... 'Live to Tell'.
It's puzzling, though, that 'Spanish Eyes' is not
included.
You'll See', the new singles, shows imagina-
tion, Hispanic overtones and a will to survive
through the '90s. The other new tracks, however,
are standard singer-in-nightclub songs which are
too safe to be really interesting.
While 'Something to Remember' would be a
good background tape to girlie nights in or dinner
parties, mostly all it does is to invoke memories of
slow dances at school discos back in the '80s. (6)
gig: bruce Springsteen -
the ghost of torn joadan
The title of Springsteen's eleventh album
acknowledges the character created by John
Steinbeck. More than half the tracks comprise
just him and an acoustic guitar with the odd spine
chilling harmonica thrown in.
The album opens with the title track and pro-
gresses with various tales of the down to earth
lives of immigrants. The immigrants in his musi-
cal tales range from those crossing the border to
find a better life; to that of an ex-convict trying to
lead a straight life, and even to war veterans trying
to fit back into society, like his previous albums,
this one has a very strong American flavour with
passing references to 'Nam and life in a rural
town.
While this may put a lot of people off, the
basic theme about trying to make life worth living
under difficult social conditions is sometiring that
most of us can relate to in more ways than one.
gig/interview: dubstarmr trout
I enquired about the Camel lighter that Dubstar's
guitarist Steve was using to spark up his Marlboro
light: "Actually, me mum
didn't know that I smoked
until I sent off for it. I was off
touring so I wasn't at home to
intercept the mail. Then she
read I was smoking in Select
and she got really mad at me."
Ho, ho, the excesses of rock
and roll.
If you are to believe the
popular music press, Dubstar j
have a lot going for them.
Their debut album
'Disgraceful' hardly set the
chart aflame, but it took them
from nothing to magazine
covers, and a fair army of fans
in no time at all: "We have
been absolutely amazed by
the fans' reaction to the tour. WeVe
each gig than the total that came to our previous
tour."
Springsteen's lyrics weave stories around
human nature and rarely leave anything to the lis-
tener's interpretations. Feelings of resentment are
captured in the story of two Vietnam veterans
whose paths eventually cross again. His voice car-
ries the songs beautifully, and all with a sincerity
that would be laughable coming from most
singers.
Accusations of hypocrisy may be justified in
view of his constant portrayal of hard working,
middle class lives when he lives anything but a life
like that. However, his ability to provide a script is
beyond comparison and will always be the
essence of his music.
This is not another 'Born To Run' and most
listeners will be put off by the slow moving num-
bers. It is a examination of the human nature and
how our basic instincts might survive or change
under the most suicidal of conditions. Let his
voice be heard and you will be touched. An
unquestionable (9).

The gig itself, though, was quite disastrous.
The technical problems hinted at in the interview
reared their unpleasant heads at annoyingly fre-
quent intervals, with great
chunks of unintentional feed-
back effectively destroying any
chance of creating the kind of
atmosphere that this style of
trip hop/rock so desperately
needs.
The high point of the set was
the soon to be released single,
'Not So Manic Now', which
seemed to capture the imagina-
tion of the crowd and the band
in its lazy brilliance. From there
the gig went downhiLl, each
song melting into the other. For
a band noted for their diversity,
they managed to sound very
'samey', and approached the
boundary of boredom.
Let this not detract from the unarguable
quality of their album, but from this evidence,
Dubstar are simply not a live band.
