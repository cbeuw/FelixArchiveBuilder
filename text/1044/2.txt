Speaking to Felix, Richard
Stacey, communications officer
at Manchester University, said
that 'private finance is not a
viable option. The bottom line is
that private companies would
want to make a profit.., and this
would mean charging students
for the privilege.' He was keen to
affirm that 'Manchester would
not go it alone [among the
Russell Group]' but would
expect that if one did, others
might follow suit. He was scepti-
cal whether or not the situation
would change under a Labour
government
IC sources say that College
do not want to charge top-up
fees, and certainly does not want
The government has further
cut the maintainance grant for
home students by 9%, bringing it
and the Student Loan to com-
prable levels. Elsewhere, the big
four high street banks are set to
unanimously reject governmental
overtures to take on the Student
Loan mantle, saying that there is
no way that they can make
money from the scheme, dashing
government hopes for a quick
privatisation.
The government plans for
increasing the numbers of stu-
dents entering higher educaton
have stalled at just over 30% par-
ticipation as spending cuts are
being sought throughout the.sys-
tem. The highest loan available
has been raised to accommodate
the drop in grant, and the total
In an unexpected move, College
has removed all of the Union's
parking spaces around the cam-
pus, as part of a 40% reduction in
the total. The space is being
taken up the site offices of con-
tractors hired to demolish the
old Chemistry Building south of
Imperial College Road.
to preside over the creation of an
American-style "Ivy League" of
super universities where the peo-
ple who go there would be based
on financial standing and not aca-
demic. Sir Ronald Oxburgh,
Rector of Imperial College,
called the cuts 'derisory' and sus-
pected that they would affect
Imperial badly because of the
heavy slant toward engineering
and science. The College would
not want to affect the quality of
its degree, and is likely to look to
overseas fees to make up the dif-
ference. Top-up fees were criti-
cised as being a highly inefficient
means of raising funds, as so
much has to be 'given back' in
administration and scholarships
for the less well off.
has increased in line with infla-
tion, whereas Access Funds, the
discretionary money doled out to
universities for them to give to
students suffering extreme fina-
cial hardship, have been frozen at
£28 million for all universities.
The troubled Student Loans
Company has been a target for a
sell-off as part of a drive for effi-
ciency. However, the govern-
ments preferred method of doing
this, getting a commercial bank
to run the Loans operation, has
come unstuck as Midland Bank
has announced that it had been
'unable to define a commerically
acceptable framework' for the
system.. The other big clearing
banks are still in talks with the
government but are expected to
react similarly.
The offices occupy the
spaces set' reserved for ICU's
minibuses, which are now double
parked behind Linstead Hall.
Places have been set aside for
disabled drivers, and disabled
students requiring spaces for
next term should still apply to
the Union office soon.
BY THE NEWS TEAM
Free Rape Alarms
Concerns have been expressed
by Matt Crompton, DP(F+S],
over the fact that few people are
aware of the availability of free
rape alarms from the union.
The alarms are available
from the union office to any that
ask as part of an ICU initiative to
reduce rape incidents among stu-
dents, especially for those stu-
dents who live far away from col-
lege.
Two sorts of alarms are
available from the union office,
namely gas-powered and elec-
tronic ones. The gas-powered
alarms are available for free
whereas the electronic device
costs £3.
Take up on the offer has
been slow, which has been
blamed on inadequate publicity.
However, student representa-
tives would encourage students
to get an alarm if they feel vul-
nerable, especially Matt, who
would like to reclaim the space
they are occupying in his office.
New Security Chief
A new Chief Security Officer has
been appointed to look after the
daily workings of Security
Operations. Mr Kenneth Weir
has served as an Military
Policeman in the army and has
had extensive experience in
investigations.
Mr Terry Briley, the previ-
ous incumbent whose prolonged
absence due to illness led to the
appointment, might return after
Mr Weir's six month contract
expires. Mr Weir can be contact-
ed on 48904.
Catwalk Finals
An unusual idea on how to earn
some cash over the summer led
first year Andrew Mayes to being
a finalist in a modelling competi-
tion run by BBC's Clothes Show
Magazine. The Chemistry fresh-
er had some photos taken by a
friend in the business and sent
them to a local agency on the off
chance of getting a job. Luckily
for him, the agency quickly put
some work his way, and this
encouraged him to enter the
competition run by the show.
Speaking to Felix, Andrew
seemed unfazed by the whole
business, saying he was 'indiffer-
ent to seeing [himself] in print',
and that it was just an idea he
took up to earn some money in
the summer vacation. He was
reluctant to consider modelling
as a full time occupation, citing
the hard work, massive competi-
tion and often having to face
rejection as reasons not to get too
involved just yet. However, he
said having the modelling as a
sideline would be useful as living
in London as a student was so
expensive.
Although Andrew didn't
walk away with the top prize, a
contract with a top London mod-
elling agency, he hasn't been put
off the business, he now wants to
concentrate on building up his
portfolio of modelling work and
completing his degree before
making any career decisions.
ICU Appoints New
Advisor
After an exhaustive two rounds
of interviewing, ICU have finally

ally went to Martin Thompson,
who has been acting as locum
until the job was filled. Martin
will officially starting at the
beginning of next term.
