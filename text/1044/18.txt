Sex!
Dear Felix,
Having read Suzanne
McDermott's letter on the 23/11,
concerning male/female ratios at IC;
the letter concluded by advising the
IC man to stop working and drinking
in the bar with the lads. Perhaps what
Ms McDermott fails to grasp is that is
exactly what most IC men do. I like
going down the bar with mates and 1
like women as well. What is it about
these two that makes them so incom-
patible? Perhaps the real question is
the amount of attention given to one
rather than the other. On one hand,
why should I have to join a club or do
something 1 really don't want to, just
to meet a woman, as Ms McDermott
advises. On the other hand it looks
like blokes are just stuck with it here
at IC.

C a r Crashes!
Dear Felix,
I'm not sure what Ms Wingrove
possibly hopes to achieve by her con-
stant whingeing (Letters, Felix 1043).
As a driver given charge of £25,000
worth of minibus, perhaps a little
more care in the first place would have
been prudent; after all, the evidence
does point to the fact that she had
been driving for too long in one stint
when she damaged the bus.
Ms Wingrove's accusations are ill-
founded. The damage done to the
vehicle was more than just a scratch
and there are several people who can
vouch for this fact. Her repeated sug-
gestions that we should just have
touched up the paintwork are irra-
tional in the extreme and point to false
economy. Anyone can see that Where
this has been done in the past on some
of the older minibuses there are now
rusting holes in the bodywork.
[...jMost unions have no more
than one or two knackered minibuses;
users of the I C U fleetshould recognise
the value of the service [...]
Finally Ms Wingrove must surely
be aware that when she hired the
minibus she signed to accept responsi-
bility for the bus. Had she remem-
bered this she may well have had no
reason to complain about an accident
which would have been so easily avoid-
ed with a little thought.
Yours,

Dear Felix,
In response to your article last
week entitled 'Welfare snubbed by
Prof. There is an important issue at
stake here. A certain union sabbatical
appears to have a selective memory of
the welfare meeting with the ex-
union advisor [...] I wanted to pro-
duce a leaflet that was not already
available in the Union office, specifi-
cally about hall matters.
I went out of my way to obtain
first hand information from the hall
wardens on the matter of student dis-
cipline. The response I got was poor
and sarcastic [...] Sarah White, I C U
President, was totally unsympathetic
— as usual [...] If Prof New's attitude
is 'just his way', then perhaps it is
time he changed it! This appears to be
the general attitude of many college
and union officials these days. It
appears that they are totally absorbed
in their sad little political games and
forget the reason that any of them are
here at all, T H E S T U D E N T S . While
the majority of the student body
seem so apathetic towads union
affairs, a little less criticism of those
who are prepared to take an active
part might produce a more positive
reponse.
Sincerely,
Julia Knight
(RCSU Welfare Officer)
Dear Felix,
The news item in your 1st
December issue headed "Welfare
Snubbed by Prof" may have raised a
few eyebrows and may also have
given the wrong impression. I think
most students would be surprised by
the headline and by the tone of some
of the comments in the article as they
will be aware of the dedication shown
by Wardens to the cause of student
welfare; they devote a large part of
their time and energy to helping stu-
dents in their halls and to sorting out
difficult problems. Geoff New has
always been and continues to be, a
prime example of this dedication.
< As regards the comments attrib-
uted to myself, your readers would
never guess from what was written
that I made it very clear to your
reporter when he telephoned me that
1 could not comment on a letter I had
not seen but that I was sure Geoff
New had no intention of hurting any-
one's feelings.
I know that Geoff sent Julia
Knight a further letter before the
Felix article appeared giving the infor-
mation she wanted and Julia also
received a letter from the registrar a
few weeks ago giving essentially the
same information. But if Julia would
like more detail she has an open invi-
tation to discuss it with myself.
Yours sincerely,
Dr Gareth Jones
College Tutor
Dear Rachel,
After reading remarks about
Professor New made in Felix 1043, I
just want to comment that one would
be very hard pressed to find a
Professor at IC more dedicated to the
welfare and well being of students
than Professor New.

that"

Correction to last Felix issue:
RE: Letter from Julia Knight to
Prof Hall
The Chairman at Bernard
Sunley should have been referred to
as Union Representative of the House
- this stops confusion between the
warden - the Chairman of the House
Committee, who did not partake in
any comment on the letter [to Geoff
New quoted] in Felix.
Robert Park
(BSH union rep)
Apparently Geoff New has written
to Julia to apologise for the misun-
derstanding and upset. So maybe
everyone will be happy ever after.
Fire!
Dear Felix,
After another Friday night fire
alarm, I'd just like to put a few mis-
conceptions straight. Most impor-
tantly — contrary to many opinions,
we do not set the alarms off as a drill
— when the alarm goes off, myself
and the stewards clear the building
because as far as we are concerned
there is a potential life threatening
incident occurring.
Believe me, clearing 600 stu-
dents in various stages of intoxication
is no fun at the best of times and
when our major concern is your safe-
ty, it is definitely made harder by
people refusing to leave so they can
finish their drinks, or because "it's
just another drill" [...] So please help
us, when you hear an alarm, please
leave the building. If it is not a gen-
uine situation, at least we can readmit
you quicker!
[...] there is no such thing as a
false alarm. We'd feel a lot better if
everyone remembers that.
Cheers,

Dear Felix,
I would like to offer an impor-
tant correction to the Welfare supple-
ment in Felix of 1 December 1995.

Smokin'
Dear Felix,
The letter published last week
on smoking in the J C R expressed a
problem that affects many students
{Felix 1043). A t the moment the J C R
does not serve its purpose as a stu-
dent common room because, despite
numerous signs which are clearly visi-
ble from every angle, heavy smoking
is still commonplace [...]
It is an established fact that for
non-smokers, inhaling smoke-filled
air is both a nuisance and a major
health hazard, thus making the place
unusable for these people, who also
happen to be the majority of stu-
dents. Since the J C R is supposed to
be accessible to everyone, the union
has a responsibility for ensuring that
its no-smoking policy is complied
with. Those who would like to light
their cigarettes should be asked to do
so in Davinci's or in the quiet space
between the J C R and SCR.
Yours sincerely,
Y. Hatami EE4
Adding up
Dear Felix,
I read with disappointment the
article 'Calculator Ban in Exams' on
Felix 1034. I am deeply disappointed
that the College Board of Examiners
made the decision without any prior
notification to the students of such
discussion, let alone any consultation.
[...] I cannot imagine how a 'par-
ity of treatment' can be achieved if
students are asked to use some col-
lege-issued, unfamiliar calculators,
which they may have seen only once
or twice beforehand, under the criti-
cal time and psychological pressure in
the end-of-year exam A N D achieve
the best results.
