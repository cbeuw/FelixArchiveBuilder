THAT'S MY SON— BIGGER GRANT, YOU KNOW •
N E W G R A N T S by JOHN COX
The recent news that University Grants were to be
increased must have cheered many of us, but i t
would be premature to consider throwing a party
to celebrate the event. I t i s possible that students
l i v i n g at home w i l l not benefit at a l l . A 10$ i n -
crease for board and lodgings i s indicated and the
means test on the State awards i s to be made less
exacting. Students i n large families w i l l benefit
most.
The decision to allow students who have won extra
awards to use up to £100 of i t i s welcome as extra
a b i l i t y has not been rewarded i n the past. Neverthe-
less, i t i s clear that the reassessment i s not i n -
tended to f u l l y offset the increased cost of l i v i n g
as the following table w i l l show.
1949 Award. 1949 awards New rate
Hostel + 32$ to offset (Uaxm. estim-
k lodgings cost of l i v i n g -ate)
:- £241 £319 £289
Home :- £180 £235 £205
(The figure of 32% increase i n the cost of l i v i n g
i s taken from the Government's cost of l i v i n g i n -
dex)
The t r i e n n i a l reassessment of 1952 made bigger
increases but the vacation allowances werh made
optional for l o c a l education authorities, and about
one third do not now pay them.
Students receiving awards from their Local Ed-
ucation Authority may expect a bigger increase as
the Government w i l l ask them to pay an amount sim-
i l a r to that awarded by the State.

Dear Sir,
We are grateful to receive copies of Felix and to
learn of the doings at South Ken. We ate,however,
shocked to read of the lack of good fellowship amongst
the men of I.C. To our memory the destruction of dec-
orations at carnivals and hurling of trifle (however
grim i t might be') was not considered to be funny.
We would heartily support Mike Neale in his con-
tention that there i s a distinction between free and
easy enjoyment and irresponsibility. One of the objects
of Varsity life i s to breed gentlemen in the fullest
sense of the word. Whilst this does not preclude jo-
cular high spirits the line is drawn at hooliganism.
Further, dishonesty, though disguised as clever-
ness is not "a good thing" (S. Potter). This has been
an insidious developement for some time but i t now app-
ears to have reaohed its zenith.
We sincerely hope to read that future carnivals will
be a success both socially and financially.
Yours etc.

Sir,
W
e sincerely hope that the views of Mr Cox,
a declared Communist, on the subject of University
Grants do not represent the views of "FELIX".
The large number of factors that must be
considered in any appreciation of the subject make
i t extremely difficult to review the situation
concisely within a small space.
Yours etc.,
J.V.Braiidey.
