THE HIAD OF THE RIVER RACE 1955
The "Head" was rowed this year once again in i t s
"correct" direction ; from Mortlake to Putney. The race
was rowed in conditions which varied from one extreme
to the other, the earlier crews starting in a near
blizzard with snow, highwind and rough water, and the
later crews rovdn^ over in warm sunshine with a gentle
breeze ruffling the surface of the Thames.
I.C. entered nine crews, thus tieing with London
and Thames for the largest entry out of a total of 227.
The 1st. VIII surprised and disappointed by dropping
in position from 8th. to 14th., a place which, though
i t fairly reflects the crew's performance on the day,
.is in no way an assessment of its potentility.
For the rest the Club did very well. The 2nd. VIII
did extremely well to finish 20th. (from 27th.), ful-
filling a three year ambition to finish in the 1st.
Division. The 3rd. VIII went up from 79th. plaoe to
64th., and the 5th. and 6th. VIIIs rose respectively
35 and 63 places on last year's positions. A l l this
helped to raise the Club's average by 15 places a crew!
. The results show particulrly a very keen and
able bunch of Freshers, many of whom are rwoing through
the Summer Term; and the Club looks forward to an
enjoyable regatta season.
W . U . S . C A R N I V A L
The World University Service, in the University
of London, are organising a Prooe3sion for tomorrow,
Saturday May 7th. This Procession will start from Hyde
Park and travel to Bedford College, via Trafalgar Square,
WITH POLICE PERMISSION! The theme is to be: "Britain
thro' the Ages". There will be no I.C. float in this
Procession, although the Mines Traction Engine might make
a good entry as a specimen of the Industrial Revolution?
A University Carnival will be held in Bedford Coll-
ege grounds during the afternoon and in the evening there
will be a Grand Ball to olose the day.
Sparkes Cup: R.C.S. 9 - Guilds 3.
R.C.S. won the Sparkes Cup for the fourth time in
six years by following up their 8-5 win over Mines by a
surprise viotory over the Guilds.
Guilds played with a strong wind in the first half,
but failed to use i t . The score was 3-3 at half-time,
and R.C.S. thereafter kept Guilds pegged back with kicks
by Holman and Shepherd. They added to J.H. Jones* try
with a penalty goal by Coates and, to general astonish-
ment, a dropped goal (in-off) by J.M.L. Hblman.

The cricket season opened quietly, the first trials
being held on the beach at Falmouth during the Rugger
Club tour. Here K. Weale was seen to be in his usual
form, but more talent was forthcoming from the later t r i -
als at Harlington.
The 1st XI played Reading University, who won the
toss and batted first. They displayed considerable con-
centration, but l i t t l e initiative, and I.C., despite poor
fielding, had a good chance to win when Reading declared
at 142 - 6 (Jordinson 4-27). By way of contrast the
I.C, batsmen showed lack of concentration and occasional
reckless initiative against indifferent bowling. They
lost 4 quick wickets, after whioh the later batsmen did
not experience much difficulty in forcing a draw at 82 -
7 (Whiddon 34).
The 2nd XI, thanks nainly to a fine 59 not out by
Regan and 5 for 45 by Amatya, scored an exciting one wic-
ket victory over Reading 2nd XI.
The Sunday XI began with a fine win over Lennox, who
made 140 - 7 dec. I.C. passed this total with several
wickets to spare, Kitchener (87 not out) astonishing those
who had come solely to barrack, notably W.S. Robinson.
The Golf Club has continued its successful season
by defeating King's College Hospital 5-1 and Middlesex
Hospital 4-2. As Middlesex are the present University
champions I.C. should stand a good chance of winning the
championship when i t i s played at Koor Park on May 25th.
An innovation at the end of last term was the dinner
held in the Upper Dining Hall. The guests included the
U.L. Captain, the Captain and Secretary of Highgate and
B i l l Cox, who, as one of the leading teachers of the game
afterwards showed an extremely interesting film, several
members taking the opportunity to discuss their failings
and pet theories with him. >
The standard of play at the Spring Meeting held at
Walton Heath on March 25th was adversely affected by the
hard winter, most members being out of practice. The
scratch cup was won by M. Hampton with a 79 and D.D. An-
derton won the Glover Cup for tho best handicap round.
The foursomes competition in the afternoon was won by K.
Lewis and A.P. MacKenzie. Hampton followed up this suc-
cess during the vacation in the Northern Open Championship
at Murcar, when he had a 72 hole aggregate of 295 to fin-
ish second amateur in a field containing 58 amateurs with
handicaps less than 4, and several professionals. He
was 8th in the overall placings.
The term was given a good start when 12 members and
ex-members opened the weekend of April 22nd at the Dormy
House at Corden Beach, Bexhill. The golf gradually det-
eriorated as the week-end progressed. In fact, more than
a few people had difficulty in driving straight on the Sun-
day morning! Those who had any energy left on Sunday eve-
ning used i t up by pushing one of the cars up and down the
road for an hour before i t would start. The weekend was
an outstanding success and i t is to be hoped that many more
will follow.
