THE NEWSPAPER OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE
EDITOR: P.A.E. SOUJHGATE Circulation 1200
like many people, the closing of the Union has
brought home to us the shook of living in the kitchen
whilst the builders are in the dining room. But there
isn't really any excuse for the deplorable decoration
in the temporary new Bar. In sooiety oiroles i t would
be called the height of bad taste; in dockland it's a
b — — eyesore.
But quite apart from this traversity of art, this
sacrlligious mockery of a university 'pub, i t i s impos-
sible to plaoe a dartboard anywhere without the risk of
removing someone's eye as he enters the Bar, and yet again,
the watering place has room for no more than three stand-
ing and one sitting - totally inadequate on crowded nights.
There is but a single word of praise. The designer
has foreseen the need of ventilation - and a fan blows a
soft breath through the Bar - perhaps to oool down the an-
ger of its patrons i n this inhospitable plaoe.
'The P3LIX p r i n t e r 3'11 Vous P l a i t L t d . has
how moved premises from South Kensington to 307A,
Telephone Plaoe, Fulham. 'Phone; FUL5179 (see

Nelson's Column Continued:-
I.C.W.A. DIHNBR AND DANCE: - i n the Ayrton Hall last F r i -
day. Both the food and the speeches were given a good re-
ception. Toasts were proposed by the Rector and Dr.Owen,
Peggy Taylor and 'Ida Hayton also spoke. The guest of
honour was Dr. Panston, Principal of Bedford. Dancing
lasted until 2 o'clock after whioh coffee and breakfast
parties lasted until dawn.
E A S T E R B A L L
Over 400 attended what must have been one of
the most enjoyable functions of the College year.
Claridge's certainly l i v e d up to i t s name J The
Buffet was a sight to be believed, much to the
i n t e r n a l discomfort of those who had partaken of
tlx Kooney's excellent H a l l Dinner beforehand. The
s t a f f were working overtime serving delicious
gateaux, f r u i t salad and l i t e r a l l y gallons of
io«d orangeade, tne l a t t e r to the pecuniary d i s -
advantage of tue waiters, one of whom was heard
to remark "They come here a l l night and a l l they
can do i s drink orangeade" — T h i s was no
doubt the outcome of end of term student finance
rather than a mass signing of the pledge)
The Curzon Orchestra played non-stop dance
music and a Piper provided Eightsomes and Gay
Gordons. Mike Neale gave an address of welcome
and bouquets were presented to Mrs. Linstead and
Peggy Taylor by members of I.C.W.A.
Tnere was no cabaret o f f i c i a l l y engaged but
many enjoyed the antics of numerous painters on
scaffolding and nigh ladders who could be seen
decorating an adjacent lounge I
The only adverse c r i t i c i s m heard concerned
the seating accommodation wnich was unfortunately
l i m i t e d u n t i l 12 o'clock. However f o r the rest
of the night an extensive and luxurious
lounge was made available and the grumbles were
30on forgotten.
*** MINES TRACTION ENGINE: By now a l l at
I.C. should be familiar with the R.S.H.
mascot. At their l a s t Union meeting,
l a s t term, the Uines t r i e d to decide on
a name for her. There were several sug-
g e s t i o n s , some of these being variations
on the name of the only lady member of
the Union, one being the name of a f o s s i l
and also "Clementine". The last was the
most popular, and those who have done
most work on the engine prefer i t . There
i s a snag, however, the name "Clementine"
was f i r s t suggested by an R.C.S. man, i n
print too. I f only he had had the decency
to keep quiet and l e t the slower thinking
Miners arrive at this most appropriate
appellation themselves.
*** R.C.S. MASCOT ? Whilst on the subject of mascots
that move, a f a t l i t t l e bird told Nelson that R.C.S
are acquiring an ancient f i r e engine from the reg-
ions of Warrington, but as the present ownere w i l l
require the machine for a procession this summer,
the scientists w i l l have to walk for a while.
**» MINES PORNOGRAPHER: Another news item from the l a s t
Uines Union meeting - somebody had the nerve to
propose the abolishment of this important post, and
there was even some serious discussion on the sub-
ject. To show that only a few have been softened
by female presence, "the boys" rejected the motion
with contempt.
*** LORD MAYOR'S SHOW - A FLOAT FOR C & G : Martin Jac-
obs sub-committee met on the 22nd. of March and
various ideas for a theme were discussed. The best
was forwarded to the organisers of the show this
year. The sub-committee hopes to have everything
cut and dried before July, so that Guildsmen can
s t a r t building the f l o a t as soon as possible i n
October. One of the chief d i f f i c u l t i e s has been
the selection of a suitable s i t e for the construc-
tion, and, as yet, no f i n a l decision has been
made.
**# ELECTION - VOTING BY POST': At the last Council
meeting I.C. was dissociated from a l l p o l i t i c s .
An I.C. p o l i t i c a l society which wanted to c i r c -
ulate I.C. voters with information as to how
they could vote (for any party) by post , cannot
now do so. D e t a i l s oan, however be obtained from,
the Union Offioes,
*** NEWS FLASH FROM CORNWALL: 'HAG' Slater just can't
be kept out of this column. A second year met-
a l l u r g i s t , l i v i n g i n Cornwall, was walking on a
h i l l s i d e with his s i s t e r when i n the distance he
perceived Hags, dark and stormy having just been
on the wrong side of a rugby victory. He pointed
out Hags to his s i s t e r who observed:" What a
peculiar man, but he looks about forty."
*** STOCKPILING OF HOCK ? There i s to be no beer but
wine at the next H a l l Dinner on May 10$h. Someone
probably considers that this move w i l l introduce
the uncouth to the a r t of better l i v i n g . We wonder
whose taste everyone w i l l have to endure.
*** FEMALE MUSCLE AT HARLINGTON: O f f i c i a l s are urgent-
l y required for the f i r s t athletics match ever
undertaken by I.C.W.A.,at Harlington against King's
tomorrow. Applicants should form a queue outside
the door of Maureen Hawes' room, No.66 i n the New
Hostel.
#** OVERHEARD AT SILWOOD: At Sunday breakfast at the
l a s t Touchstone weekend, Mr. UcDowall, our General
Studies Administrator, was heard to say:"I want to
be a sex maniac." He was i n fact t e l l i n g a story
about a l i t t l e boy,an avid reader of horror comics,
who was asked what he wanted to be when he grew up.
NEWSPAPER STRIKE: We understand that a certain well
known gentleman of I.C. made money during the stopp-
age by s e l l i n g duplicated sheets of racing results
for a spiv i n the Strand. Helping to s e l l 2000 i n
one hour, he earned ten s h i l l i n g s .
*** YOU WILL BE ABLE TO QUENCH A RED HOT POKER IN
YOUR GLASS OF STOUT i n the new bar now being
b u i l t i n the Union. There should be a coal f i r e
there - a l l being well.
»** TOLD BY DR.WILLIS JACKSON AT THE RADIO SOC. DINNER:
"One of my colleagues", said the doctor,"made a
glaring faux pas at a public school presentation.
Be came to the awards for cricket and said:'I now
present the Smith cricket cup to Jones Major for
the best performance; and bails to the rest of the
team."
