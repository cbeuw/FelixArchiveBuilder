MODEL AIRCRAFT DISCOV-
ERED ON MARS
At the end of last year the aero-
modelling world heaved a huge sigh of
relief as I C M A C was ripped apart by
the departure of its strong third year
contingent into the big wide world.
They all thought that they were safe
b u t t h e y w e r e w r o n g ; t h i s m o s t
indescribable of institutions has been
revived by the influx of first y e a r
v i c t i m s a n d w i t h a m e m b e r s h i p
reaching into the twenties widespread
p a n i c h a s e r u p t e d . R e p o r t s a r e
flooding in that moles are digging
their tunnels an extra foot deep and
t h a t w o r m s a r e a d o p t i n g c r a s h
helmets in an an attempt to survive
attacks by p i e c e s of h i g h velocity
balsa wood.
A statement by the club secretary:
While it is true that our membership
has increased recently it must be said
that efforts have been made to reduce
this subterranean" carnage.
Nick Green broke the club's power
trainer in half very neatly and the
depth of penetration into the ground
was minimal.
Praise also goes to John Stannard
who made use of a convenient black
hole at Richmond park to fly his
Corona into a parallel universe where
it remains to this day.
It can be seen that the current trend
is towards responsible flying although
there is always trouble with inexperi-
enced or irresponsible, for example
the brutal attack by Trefor Ellis on a
worm using Grain's Ipomoea and the
introduction by Graeme Dunbar of a
fiendish 36" wing span slope-soarer
c a p a b l e of p i n - p o i n t h i g h s p e e d
attacks on anything or anybody with
the advantage that it remains intact to
kill again.
I feel that I should not be too hard
on these cads (my flying being what it
is) and have given them a chance to
explain their behaviour.
Trefor: / thought it was a snake.
G r a e m e : It fits in a carrier bag.
A s for my excuse: Well, it's good
fun, innit?
If you have actually read all of this
drivel ( I C M A C members may stop now
a n d r e t u r n to t h e i r t o m b s ) t h e n
chances are that you will wish to know
more. Is there more? L O T S ! S o come
to one of our meetings in the South-
side Upper Lounge on Thursdays at
1:00pm or contact Jeremy Stuttard,

Right! A new term! But Imperial College
Communtiy Action Group is still and always here
and we can offer you unlimited opportunity to
help others; and like absolutely nothing else at
IC, it's totally free.
That's one good point, and to cap that are the
things we actually do. A fave rave on Tuesdays
and Fridays are the soup runs to the cowboys (as
they call themselves) living in and around the
Embankment. These dossers prove that the
streets of London are not paved with gold but
rather that it is easier to walk on the sleeping
bodies of these rather pleasant but a little
unloved chaps and femmes. They are tons of fun
and for those of you who smile, we have some
good company prepared in these people.
Falmouth kitchens 10:30pm.
For those of you also who hate footy on
Wednesday afternoons we have a few kids who
need tutorinq on 'O' level subjects in Pimlico and
we can get you in touch with Dr Goodlad who
organises it. All travelling expenses are refunded
and you don't even need a passport!
Two examples of good things you can do. Now
make yourself the third example of good by
visiting us any Monday at 12:30pm in the ICCAG
Room, third floor of the Union Building.
Still time to go to the Holly St Adventure
Playground. Transport available from Beit Arch at
10:30am on Saturday.

Do you want your grant to go further? Do you
want cheaper food? Would like a healthier diet?
Would you like Mr Mooney to provide better food
in the canteens? Do you know what goes on in
factory farms? Are you against some kinds of
meat for religious reasons? Are you vegetarian or
vegan? Or, do you just want a more varied diet?
If your answer to any of these questions is yes,
then we have good news for you: there is now a
Vegetarian Society. You don't have to be a
vegetarian to join — anyone is welcome. Don't
worry, we won't eat you! The next meeting is on
Monday 28th January at 12:45pm in the Green
Committee Room (top floor Union Building, next
to Welfare). If you have any questions to ask
about vegetarianism, you will find plenty of
answers there.
For more information, contact anyone on the
committee:
Chairman: Dinesh Singh (Maths PG)
Secretary: Tom Empson (Physics PG)
Treasurer: Vinod Dhanak (Physics PG)
Publicity Officer: Fiona Sinclair (Maths
Ordinary Members: Kirsten Pratt (Maths 2) and
Mark Nathan (EE3).

Mr Mooney has promised us that, for the first
time since 1950, for one week this term in the
Sherfield Refectory, he will attempt to raise the
quality of his cooking to more nutritious and
palatable standards (ie serve better food). If this
is a success, he may go on to make more
improvements, so it is important that everyone
eats this food — whatever he produces, even if
you don't like it — or he may wait another 30
years before he tries again.
This is the chance of a lifetime, so make the
most of it!
