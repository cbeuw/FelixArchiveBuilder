Dear Colin
I would like to reply to last
week's letter from T C Tan
concerning the Bookshop and
to clarify some other points on
this matter.
The Bookshop was set up
many years ago jointly by I C U
and the three C C U s . T h e
Union has a majority on the
Bookshop committee (including
the C h a i r m a n ) , the o t h e r
members being the Bookshop
Manager and two members of
staff appointed by the Rector.
All Bookshop profits go to the
Union.
The prices of the books sold
are fixed by the publishers and
c a n n o t be a l t e r e d by the
Bookshop. The price of sta-
tionery is for us to determine;
I've had a number of com-
plaints about this and am at
present investigating the situa-
tion. I expect to see a substan-
tial reduction in prices in the
near future, particularly on
paper and files.
A n y comments about the
B o o k s h o p (and particularly
how well it serves your depart-
ment) should be given to your
Departmental Representative,
who will hand them on to me.
Yours
Malcolm Brain
Chairman, IC Bookshop Com-
mittee

Dear Colin
I must comment about the
general standard of last week's
FELIX.
Most articles were short and
to the point. The N U S Confer-
ence Report by Chirs Webb
was a fine piece of journalism
and Roger Stotesbury's Hon
Sec Report yielded several bits
of useful info. Perhaps some of
last term's contributors missed
the boat for this first edition of
1980, and others had made
New Year's Resolutions!
Sadly, our friendly, neigh-
bourhood Liberal correspondent
let the side down by neither
missing the copy date nor
changing his tune. Discussing
'New Technology', 'The Cuts'
and Liberal politics is important
if there is anything new to be
said, but 1 get a distinct feeling
of deja vu from last term's
F E L I C E S , U G M s , L i b e r a l
literature, etc. Could it be that
Mr Cole is using che pages of
FELIX for a repeated filtration
of his prototype article-letter-
speech; and if so, are we
steadily getting a purer product
in the most concentrated form,
or just bigger and bigger lumps
of the mucky residue?
Last week's editorial took a
fresh look at entertainments at
I C . In my view this is an
important issue, and if most
students have not been show-
ing much concern about the
situation of late, it is only
another indication that current
E n t s p r o g r a m m e s are not
fulfilling their potential as a
central part of College life. The
forthcoming FELIX question-
aire should give a good guide
of grass-roots opinion to the
powers that be in the Union.
The Editor's decision to drop
out of PWP is also encouraging
because it provides an opportu-
nity for a new face to be
elected onto the Union Coun-
cil. I feel that this democratic
exercise will have been point-
less if an established hack is
elected to his second or third
post, as it would not be a step
in the direction of ensuring the
widest possible representation
of views in the making of
decisions which affect us all.
Yours

Dear Colin
I see from your last editorial
that you have considered the
creation of a new Union post
(Social Secretary). The most
surprising thing to me is the
comparatively lowly status of
IC Ents with the Union. How
can Ents be compared with
S C A B Clubs such as Debating
Society and Folk Club, which
(at least at present) cater for
much more specialized groups?
H a s a n y o n e c o n s i d e r e d
making IC Ents more impor-
tant and thus more directiy
• responsible to the Executive
and the Union members?
