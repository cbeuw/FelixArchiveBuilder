S T M A R Y ' S C O L L E G E vs IC 1st
X V : 4-14
A s the t e a m t r a v e l l e d d o w n to
Twickenham, we all had hopes for a
good start to the second half of the
season.
* From the kick-off, it was clear that
the St Mary's pack were going to be
quite a handful, but due to s o m e
determined and spirited teamwork, our
p a c k were a b l e to c o n t a i n t h e m ,
adequately.
Although under constant pressure,
the IC forwards were able to supply
novice scrum-half/capt Eddie (me!)
with some excellent ball. This was in
turn put to good use by our stand-in
stand-off, Tony Morgan. With some
useful kicking and positive running by
the backs, we were able to put our
opposition under a lot of pressure.
From a scrum on St Mary's 25, I was
able to break blind and slip an inside
ball for (young man?) Ray Parkinson
to score. After this St Mary's began to
play a little m o r e , but w e r e well
contained by a sound IC defence.
Our second try was a copy book try;
the ball was smartly fed along the 3's,
with full-back, Nick Morton, making an
extra man, to Ray, who "opened his
legs" to score under the posts.
T h e s e c o n d half was a t o u g h e r
battle and we were made to produce
some of the most determined play,
seen for a long time, to retain our
slender lead. The killer punch came
late on, when A n d y L o r a w z inter-
c e p t e d a pass and s p r i n t e d thirty
yards to s c o r e a well d e s e r v e d , if
somewhat fortunate try.
All in all, it was a very worthwhile
performance from the whole team and
made the game very enjoyable.

In a thrilling match, the result of
which was however, never in doubt,
R C S showed their opponents how to
win, with a determined performance.
For the first twenty minutes, the match
was fairly evenly balanced, with R C S
first having the e d g e . T h e break-
through came after 22 minutes, when
'guest' player Chris Riley scored his
first goal. Paul Farrington soon added
a second and Chris Riley made it
three just before the interval after one
of his many penetrating runs.
The second half saw R C S slacken
somewhat, conceding one goal soon
after the break, scoring one them-
selves almost immediately, but then
slipping to a narrow 4-3 lead. How-
ever the result was put beyond doubt
by surprise choice left-winger Keith
Schrod. A sixth goal was added by

afterwards: "I am pleased to see that
the intensive training that my players
went t h r o u g h over the C h r i s t m a s
holdiay has paid off. I bet that the
Miners are as sick as parrots."
The Mines team were later said to
be " as sick as parrots'.

IC L A D I E S vs KINGS C O L L E G E H O S P :
4-3
Last Saturday IC Ladies attempted to
go out to Harlington by mini-bus.
Thanks must go to Pat Dunleavy for
getting out of bed to try to start the mini-
bus. However, all his efforts failed and
we resorted to London Transport and
eventually arrived half an hour late.
The pitch was very hard and
conditions throughout the game were
not ideal. Both teams had to concentrate
on accurate short passes.
It was Imperial who adopted their
game most successfully and took the
lead early on when a shot from Fay Hood
took a deflection off a Kings' stick and
landed in the back of the net.
Imperial continued to dominate the
play but Kings looked dangerous on the
break and it was thanks to some solid
tackling from Cathy Crossley that they
were unable to score in the first half. At
half-time the home team were 2-0 up
with Fay Hood adding to her earlier goal
when she picked up a superbly timed
pass from Hilary Carter.
Early in the second-half Kings came
back to 2-1, but Imperial continued to
apply pressure. We were awarded a
penelty flick when the Kings' goaly
deliberately obstructed on the goal line.
Shirley Course made the flick count.
Kings began to make more penetrating
moves especially up the right-wing but
found the IC defence too solid. A n d
again pulled back to a one goal margin.
The fourth Imperial goal was scored
by Carol Thomas, but Imperial began to
flag in the dosing minutes of the game
and Kings scored the final goal, again
from a break by the right-wing.
The team was: Averil Horton, Alex
Burnip, Cathy Crossley, Clare Davy,
Shirley Course, Julia Towns (Capt),
Alison OVersby, Hilary Carter, Fay
Hood; Mary Harrington and Carol
Thomas.

O n Saturday, the seconds returned
to Harlington's pastures green and
became the first side to take a point
from U C this season. Playing with

haircuts, new boots and surfeits of
turkey. The side fought hard to record
a fine moral victory and maintain this

other U L College and Hospital opposi-
tion.
University College kicked off and
immediately resorted to their iniqui-
tous tactics. They played the ball to
their midfield men, deliberately forcing
Phil Niccols to tackle and thus muddy
his new boots. If this wasn't enough to
boil the b l o o d of any h o n o u r a b l e
s p o r t s m a n , the U C w i n g e r t h e n
blatantly centred the ball, compelling
D e c M c G u c k i n to h e a d clear, a n d
ruffle his beautifully groomed coifure.
For a while IC withstood this intimi-
datory assault, but the defence was
finally pierced by a loopy header.
Rewarded by their initial bouts of
provocation, U C proceeded with this
style of play, but added a second
dimension, speed, to their repertoire.
The true sportsman of IC defence,

Leicester City had failed to do: beat
Harlow on their own ground. However,
after having realised that they were
not playing the Harlow team, IC 3rds
produced some exciting pressure play
in the first ten minutes. The Harlow
defence was severely stretched, partly
due to them playing a 'kicking back'
rather than a goalkeeper and partly
due to the speed of the IC attacks.

eventually and it was centre forward
Mark Talbot who put his name on the
s c o r e s h e e t first. T h a t the H a r l o w
defence was lacking in both confi-
dence and coordination was shown
when left-winger Robyn Morgan was
left completely unmarked to score the
second goal from a right-wing cross.
Their vunerability to the crossed ball
was emphasised once more w K , . . a

In the s e c o n d half however, the
picture was very different. T h e IC
defence was put to the test and found
to be lacking in match practice as a
unit and it was only due to several
incredible scores and a few stupen-
dous (!) saves from goalkeeper David
Moynham that IC were able to keep a
clean sheet. Up front, the forwards
had less success due to the fact that
Harlow were playing a highly effective
but hyper-negative offside game (is
this why they had no supporters?)
which suggested that a goal would
o n l y c o m e from a b r e a k . D a n i e l
Benham, with the speed of a lame
carthorse on its way to the knackers'
yard, ran forty yards to s c o r e his
s e c o n d and IC's fourth goal, five
minutes from time. IC had a goal
disallowed for offside, but the final
score, in a highly competitive match
was four goals to nil.

A half-time pep-talk on the true

full-time whistle prevented further IC
goals.
