ROBERT PRYOR M E M O R I A L L E C T U R E
Last M o n d a y , the 13th of January, M r
A G Frame, the Deputy C h a i r m a n of
R T Z gave the Robert P r y o r M e m o r i a l
Lecture to the Mining and Metallurgical
Society. Sir M a r k T u r n e r had originally
been invited to give the lecture, but was
unable to do so because of an overseas
engagement.
The lecture's purpose was to acknowl-
edge the late P r o f P r y o r ' s w o r k a n d
interests. H e w o r k e d for many years at
Rio Tinto, both in general management
and in training many young people in his
discipline. The skill with which these men
are n o w a p p l y i n g t h e m s e l v e s i n the
development of this important orebody is,
said M r Frame, a fitting tribute to the
man.
The main themes of the lecture were
B r i t a i n ' s r o l e i n t h e w o r l d m i n e r a l
industries, a British mineral supply policy,
and the problems facing the world in
ensuring an adequate supply of energy in
the next century.
U K mining houses are an important,
although not dominating force on the
world mining scene. However, says M r
Frame, we must all recognise that we live
in an increasingly nationalistic world, and
state intervention is an aspect of our
mining lives which will not go away, now
will the increasing tendency "for other
countires to have greater local partici-
pation in natural resource projects.
A m i n e r a l p o l i c y for t h e U K a n d
Western Europe was then considered.
T h e prime aim of European policy should
be to obtain adequate supplies of minerals
and metals at internationally competitive
prices, preferably from secure and well
diversified sources.
V e r y often the best policy is to resist
t h e t e m p t a t i o n t o i n t e r f e r e i n t h e
workings of the market. T h e C o m m o n
Agricultural Policy is the biggest warning
t o B r u s s e l s a b o u t t h e d a n g e r s of
bureaucratic intervention. Several small
steps can be taken both at national and
c o m m u n i t y level to i m p r o v e E u r o p e ' s
security of mineral supply.
E n e r g y is a vitally i m p o r t a n t subject
w h i c h is likely to affect w o r l d growth
a n d t h e r e f o r e , t h e o u t l o o k of t h e
m i n i n g i n d u s t r y .
T h e g e n e r a l c o n s e n s u s of o p i n i o n in
t h e p e t r o l e u m i n d u s t r y is t h a t t h e
w o r l d c o u l d have all the energy it
n e e d s for the rest of t h e T w e n t i e t h
C e n t u r y . T h e r e will, however, be prob-
l e m s of d i s t r i b u t i o n a n d t h e r e w i l l
p r o b a b l y be s u b s t a n t i a l i n c r e a s e s i n
prices.
T h e o v e r a l l c o n c l u s i o n w a s t h a t

d e v e l o p m e n t of c o a l a n d n u c l e a r power,
the o u t l o o k for the T w e n t y First C e n -
tury is bleak in the extreme.

ORIENTEERING
I C O C had their first outing of 1980 last
Sunday to a club event at Puttenham
C o m m o n near G u i l d f o r d . T h e area
consisted of rough open and semi-open
heath with smaller areas of runnable
woodland. This combined with a well
defined path system posed few naviga-
tional problems for those who competed.
On the 'A' course (9.7km), Steve Kirk
(65 mins) and Alan Parker (72 mins) did
quite well with Andrew Britton (89 mins)
not too far behind. John Weaver (69
mins) was about ten minutes behind the
winner on the 'B' course (8.1km) whilst
on the same course Nick W~*mough
clocked a rather dubious 84 ruins. On the
shorter courses others met with mixed
success.
Trips to events are planned for most
Sundays this term which will provide
p l e n t y of p r a c t i c e for six d a y s of
championships standard orienterring in
Scotland over the easter vacation. As
ever meetings take place every Friday at
12:30pm in the Union Senior Common
Room.

Despite the non-appearance of an article
in last week's F E L I X , R C S is alive and
kicking. Dates have now been sorted out for
most of the major events this term.
After a very successful autumn term the
R C S Rag machine gets back on the road
again or rather O x f o r d Street. T h e
lampposts are looking somewhat the worse
for wear and need cleaning. Volunteers to
help recify this should meet at 9:30am
tomorrow in the R C S Office complete with
soap and Rag cans.
General Committee will meet for the first
time this term o n Tuesday in the U n i o n
Lower Refectory at 6:00pm. N e x t meeting
after this will be on 26th February and
observers will be welcome at both meetings.
O n the sporting side, the R C S soccer
sixes will take place on Sunday 27th January
and the R C S rugby sevens on Sunday 10th
February. Soccer teams should be given to
M o Misra and rugby teams to Ray M y e r s .
M o has also organised training for
prospective T e n Torists. F o r those
interested this takes place on M o n d a y
mornings at 7:30am (meet Beit archway)
and on Friday evenings at 6:00pm (meet
U n i o n G y m ) .
Ents Committee met for the first time this
term on M o n d a y . T h e y decided that to
organise a night out on Tuesday 29th
January to the theatre, details of which will
be circulated as soon as possible.

C & G U
A short article this week, just a few
reminders of what's on. Saturday is Pyjama
Rag, to to make sure we have a good
collection we want all of you to turn up at
9:30am in the U n i o n Office suitably attired.
Remember to wear something warm under
the pyjamas as it is a bit (note subtle
understatment) cold at this time of year.
T h e next event is the 29th Annual
Engineers' Dinner and Dance. This is the
highlight of the College year and is a formal
occasion. T h e event will be held in the
Sherfield Building on Friday 25th January at
7:30 for 8:00pm. The evening consists of a
formal dinner followed by a cabaret and
dancing to the early hours of Saturday.
Hence the name Dinner and Dance or D & D
for short.
Tickets are on sale from the Union Office
or from D e p Reps at the price of £18.00 for a
double ticket and £10.00 for a single and are
limited in number, so get yours early. The
dress for the evening is black tie. W e have
managed to negotiate a deal with M o s s
Bros, which will give a 25% reduction to you
on production of a union card for the hre of a
dinner jacket at any of their L o n d o n
branches.
D o not miss the chance to go to this
outstanding event.
Cheers Bryan.
