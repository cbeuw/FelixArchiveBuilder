The first External Affairs Committee
Meeting of 1980 was held on M o n d a y 14th
January. The meeting lasted almost two
hours due to the large amount of business.
The main items were reports by various
people who attended conferences over
Christmas and the triennial review of policy.
There was also a discussion on U L U as the
C h a i r m a n of the Student Representative
•Council has resigned and nominations for
the post are open. The N U S report has
already been in F E L I X . T h e report on the
W U S conference shall be in the next few
weeks.
The Policy Review is done by the various
relevant organisations in College. This
updates old policy and must then be
presented by the H o n Sec at the next U n i o n
meeting, so be prepared if you wish to
a m e n d any existing policy.
O n action of this term, it was decided that
speakers should be invited from the various
organisations which sent us material, eg
Chile, Nat C o u n c i l for Civil Liberties. There
will also be a motion on Repressive Regimes
and Self-Determination F o r Oppressed
Countries with the aim of organising a
d e m o n s t r a t i o n o u t s i d e the R u s s i a n
Embassy. A l s o an External Affairs file with
material on Overseas Students, S U
A u t o n o m y , U L U and many other things will
be prepared and put in the Haldane Library
for general reading. The next meeting is on
4th February in G r e e n Committee R o o m . I
would like to thank the sabbaticals for
coming to a meeting!
