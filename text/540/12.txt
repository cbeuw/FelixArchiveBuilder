The Imperial College Rugby 1sts walked
away from Hartington with a good win at the
expense of H A C R F C . A t r y by J o h n
chandler, converted by Eddie Budgen together
with a penalty from Pat Dunleavy took the
scorefine to 9—3 by full time.
The 2nds did even better beating Queen
Elizabeth College 11 points to 3. Fran O'Toole
opened the scoring in the first half with an
unconverted try. Nick Morion added a second
with a penalty in the second half.
The soccer news was not so good: the 1sts
went down 5—0 to Kings College Hospital,
while the 6ths lasts 7—2 to the same college.
The 2nds did slightly better drawing 2—2
against University College 2nds, with Phil
Niccols and Tom Hanke scoring the goals. The
IC 3rds lost 3—2 to University College, Andy
Hartland scoring both the -goals here. On a
happier note, the 5ths beat U C 4ths by default
after they failed to show.
Finally, hockey and IC's 1sts won 2—0,
beating Harlow with goals from Tony Debarr
and Graham Forbes on Saturday. The 3rds
w o n as w e l l b e a t i n g H a r l o w t w i c e as
effectively. Goats from Daniel Benham, Robin
Morgan and two from Mark Talbot took the
score-line to 4—0.

The first rugger team continued with
Saturday's form beating Kings College at
Hariington on Wednesday. A first half try by
John Chandler, converted by Eddie Budgen
was all that was needed leaving the final score
6—3.
The only other rugby on Wednesday since
the seconds match was cancelled was the
R S M matches against Surrey.'The 1sts did
well beating Surrey Ists 12—0. After no score
at half time, due in part to the fact that they
were playing uphill. Vision Tucker and Bat
Walmsey both scored trys and both were
converted by Maynard McMaynard.
The R S M 2nds also walked away from
Surrey with a win beating Surrey 2nds 7—6,
thanks to a try from Russ Clark and a penalty
from Jeremy Taylor. The R S M 3rds didn't do
'quite as well losiong 14—0 to Surrey 3rds.
On to soccer again now and the news that
must dominate must be the 4ths win over
Goldsmith's 3rds. They won 7—1 despite a
scoreline of 1—1 just 25 minutes from the end,
this due to a goal from Steve Simms. Two
goals from Paul Garvin and Richard Dolan
within a minute plua four from Tom Hanke
buied Goldsmiths. The scoreline is all the more
remarkable because their goalkeeper was
transferred to the 3rds for the afternoon and
the captain, Dave Brennan had to take his
place.
The 2nds also had a good win at the
expense of the London School of Economics.
Two goals from Dick Veenman and anther two
from Dave McPhail took the score to 4—0 by
half time. L S E fought well during the second
half but still had to be content with a scoreline
of 4—1.
The 3rds lost 3—2 to Goldsmiths 2nds
away. Goals from Ian Stevenson in the first
half and from Andy Hartland in the 2nd made
the score look respectable.
There was also good news from the 5ths
who beat L S E 3rds 2—0. A goal from John
Healy in the first half and another from Nick
Matthews in the 2nd completed a fairly good
day for IC soccer.
The good news continues with the cross-
country results. E Cameron came in first in
Wednesday's friendly at Petersham with a time
of 27 minutes~49 seconds, 9 seconds ahead of
D Feteenstein from U C . M Pickard and S Kirk
both from IC came in 3rd and 4th respectively
under a minute later.

IC
London Student Travel has opened a new
office on the walkway, Sherfield Building. This
site is in a more central position than the old
office in the Union Building, making it more
accessible to non-student members of IC and
the extra space available means that better
facilities can be provided.
ISRAELI W E E K
The Jewish Society has decided to hold
an exhibition to further the information
a v a i l a b l e to C o l l e g e s t u d e n t s o n the
subject of Israel. Being in England the
only information one receives on Israel is
what one hears through the media, and
this is so politically orientated that no one
hears the other facets of Israeli life and
culture. F o r example, did you know....
....that the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra
ranks among the best in the world.
....that Israel is no bigger than Wales.
....that inflation in Israel is over 100%
....that Israeli girls do....army service!
....that I S R A E L is!!
During the four-day activity, we will be
two films, hearing the chairman of the
Zionist Federation talk on kibbutz life,
joining in Israeli dancing and eating Israeli
food!
W e hope to see many of you at these
events.
