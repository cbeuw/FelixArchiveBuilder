amateur sports a n d a n all too easy prey
to international politics. T h e G a m e s have

participants. T h e honour of holding the
Olympics G a m e s is awarded t o a city,
and not to a country, the choice of the
city lying entirely with the I O C . They
have never been held in Russia before; in
theory, the choice of city made by the
I O C is unbiased, but if the city chosen
lies in a country politically structured like
Russia, it is a n unfortunate fact that the
responsibility will be assimiliated by the
central government to the abeyance of
the underlying ideals.
There is no doubt that Russia puts
considerable political value o n the G a m e s .

M u n i c h in 1972. N o w the most ambitious
interference to date is being planned, by
western powers, to disrupt the games to
the detriment of Russia in retaliation for
her military intervention in Afghanistan.
T h e United Nations has made it abun-
dantly clear that they hold the presence
of Soviet troops in Afghanistan to be
undesirable, but any practical redress lies
in the hands of the discreet nations.
President Carter's demand that the
O l y m p i c s be removed from M o s c o w has
been rebuffed by the I O C w h o state
categorically that they cannot change the
venue. A m e r i c a is backed by Britain a n d
C a n a d a has offered to play host to the
G a m e s ; the Netherlands has gone so far
as t o w i t h h o l d f i n a n c i a l a i d f r o m its

everyone else) are obliged to m a k e only
recommendations; decisions should lie at
the discretion of the national O l y m p i c
committees. In an effort to resolve these
problems, the G r e e k government sug-
gested that the G a m e s be lifted out of the
political arena a n d held permanently in

least seriously hinder her participation in

had serious implications for British sport
as a whole, threatening to isolate her in
world sport. While she is unlikely to be
forgiven quickly, Britain should have little

F o r A m e r i c a , stepping out in front,
Carter's call for collective action is still far
f r o m a n s w e r e d . E u r o p e h a s failed t o
agree o n sanctions against Russia, either
Olympic or economic. A m e r i c a taking the
lead over the G a m e s m a y well be a way
for her to sound out the opinions a n d
intentions of her allies o n the economic

also hit back with embargoes. H i s anxiety
that A m e r i c a might be left out o n a limb
is compounded by the fact that Britain's
£950 million export credit to Russia is due
for renewal in the next few weeks; if it is
not c a n c e l l e d , c o l l e c t i v e a c t i o n c o u l d
become the object of ridicule. Carter's
most controversial decision was to place
such importance o n the Olympics, which
by d e f i n i t i o n a r e n o t s u b j e c t t o a n y
international restraints a n d so cannot be
c o n t r o l l e d b y e x t e r n a l p o w e r s . Inter-
national exchanges of any kind are liable
to debasement by politics; the I O C now
has the difficult task of safeguarding the
Olympic G a m e s a n d with it world sport.
