Engineering Graduates
A u d i e n c e P a r t i c i p a t i o n
It would be very easy for us to tell y o u h o w wonderful the
B B C is-but we have a sneaking suspicion that the kind of
men and women we are seeking wouldn't be satisfied with
that sort of approach. So below you'll see answers to the
questions we are most often asked.
Q : What qualifications do I need?
A : A degree in Electrical or Electronic Engineering,
Electronics, A p p l i e d Physics or any other relevant science
subject. We also welcome people with H N C / H N D ,
C & G Full Tech. or T E C Higher Certificates in Electronics
or Telecommunications.
Q : T h e B B C is a very large organisation-where would
I fit in?
A : O u r Engineers work in a wide variety of disciplines
including digital techniques, micro-circuitry, automation,
data processing and transmission, high-quality
quadraphonic, stereo and m o n o sound reproduction.
A s you can see, the scope for development-both yours and
ours-is limitless.
Q : So presumably you'll be able to give me full training?
A : O u r engineering instruction is the best in the world,
either in or out of the broadcasting business. A n y Engineer
with B B C training can count him or herself firmly among
the engineering elite. Prospects within the B B C are, as you
might expect, outstanding-today's recruits are tomorrow's
experts.
Q : If I joined the B B C where would I be based?
A : You could be located anywhere in the U K , in posts
ranging from Research to Operational Engineering-the long
arm of the B B C extends a lot further than Broadcasting
House.
Q : W h a t about pay and benefits?
A : T h e simple answer is, the right people get the right money.
Salaries in 1979 for Engineers started at around £5,170 in
L o n d o n or £4,720 elsewhere and most recruits earned a
great deal more by way of shift allowance and overtime.
Graduate trainees received at least £5,745. These salaries
will be reviewed i n April 1980.
Q : H o w do I apply?
A : Check with your Careers Adviser to see whether we are
visiting your University or College. If we are not, then write
direct to Bob Neal, Engineering Recruitment, B B C ,
Broadcasting House, London W1A 1AA.
