Debbie H a r r y is voluptuous, was the
verdict at the first of seven concerts by
rock group, Blondie at the H a m m e r s m i t h
O d e o n on Friday.
It was one of those concerts where you
stood up and danced — clapped or just
admired the lady in action. She was in
superb form, sending the blood tempera-
ture up in many a young man even before
the second number (Slow Motion) had
ended, during which she almost managed
to screw herself into the floor.
D r u m m e r , C l e m B u r k e — the second
Keith M o o n — was also a 'super hero'
showing vast amounts of energy. Beating
an .excellent solo introduction to Union
City Blues. S p e a k i n g a b o u t g o o d
beatings, a girl (Friday) a n d boy (Sunday)
managed to get on the stage. They were
q u i c k l y r e m o v e d , by a large s e c u r i t y
guard.
Classic Blondie tracks played included
Denise, Picture This, Heart Of Glass,
and Hanging On The Telephone. The
encores (2) included Sunday Girl with
R o b e r t F r i p p as a guest. T h e w h o l e
p e r f o r m a n c e l a c k e d n o t h i n g e i t h e r
musically or on the lighting side.
The touts had a field day charging £30
for a stall ticket, though thanks to T i m
Reeves I was able to get a ticket for
Sunday's performance a lot cheaper.
If y o u e v e r get the c h a n c e to see

L O N D O N CALLING
The Clash
Well, the third C l a s h album is upon us
and is their most diverse collection of
material yet. This album is far removed
from the glue stained punk of The Clash
and soft heay metal of Give 'Em Enough
Rope. W e l l e n o u g h w i t h the h i s t o r y
lesson, on with the music.
Taking the tracks in order, we start
with London Calling which is a call to
unity that creates a feeling that this could
be the last decade if things go on as they
are now (ie needless division of p u n k s —
mods—dreads—skins—angels—hippies—
disco kids etc and hatred). Brand New
Cadillac is slightly X e r o x rockabilly that is
saved by a great line that serves as a
poke in the eye for those who think men
are men and women should do what
they're told: "Balls to you B i g Daddy (She
ain't never coming back". O n t o Jimmy
Jazz — this really is great: the dirtiest,
greasiest blues tune I've heard in ages.
Strummer sings this like he's half cut
which adds to the atmosphere. Hateful,
the second good track in a row, is a piece
of amphetamined boogie about the drug
taking that goes on in certain circles — ie
don't do it. Rudie Can't Fail, another
good track, potentially great, about the
aggro facing Rudie (or any other rebel for
that matter), how people try and shape
you and how they put you down if you
don't conform. Spanish bombs starts side
two and it's fairly harmless, musically
limp but the sentiments expressed in the
song are good: revolution in 1980? 81?
82? The Right Profile — this is a killer -
a tribute to Montgomery Clift (whoever
he is), but bowls along like a chieftan
tank, threatens to go out of control —
love it! Lost In The Supermarket about
being overwhelmed by consumerism, but
it's very innocuous and bland. Sadly, it's
rather disposable. N e x t , Working For The
Clampdown: this is classic C l a s h , deals
with the propaganda with which we are
bombarded today about "growing up and
calming down". Last one on album one is
G u n s Of Brixton, w r i t t e n b y P a u l
S i m o n o n (bassist), it's terse reggae with
oppression as its theme; another good
track.
A l b u m two kicks off with W r o n g 'Em
Boyo: S t r u m m e r s t o p s this half w a y
through and restarts the song ska style
which works well and should be great
l i v e . N o w o n to Death Or Glory,
hmmm....slightly heavy metal, lads, a bit
of a disappointment really, but no one's
perfect — it's about how punk sold out
(Ha!) which we all know about and don't
want to be reminded of. Koka-Kola next,
I bet C B S U S A had a shock when they
h e a r d t h i s , as it's a b o u t t h e i r ( U S A
E x e c u t i v e ) f a v o u r i t e p a s t i m e , n a m e l y
shoving vast amounts of cocaine up their
noses — the song does not glorify it.
Then the token Phil Spector track which
really is a wall of sound, namely The
Card Cheat about the futility of gambling,
but w h a t c a n a p o o r boy d o ? T h e n
Lovers Rock which is awful, about sexism
and equality — the sentiments expressed
are good but are put across so mawkishly
it makes me cringe. Four Horsemen, the
next track is just as bad; stop, 1 say. I'm
Not Down: again too Beatley for my
l i k i n g , b u t a g o o d s o n g a b o u t n o t
succumbing to defeat. Revolution Rock,
good song, excellent reggae — the title
says it all. Last track, not listed on the
sleeve Train In Vain, a sould song in the
best m o d style no less, but whipped out
by the band in a way that makes Secret
Affair look what they are — useless.
All in all a good ablum, with a few bad
points and songs, but it makes me feel it's
probably the last good C l a s h album as I
can see them becoming more introverted
and embarrassing (ie Lovers Rock). I
hope not though.
