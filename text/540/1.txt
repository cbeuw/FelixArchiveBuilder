Last Tuesday, forty students turned up to a meeting discussing
the 'Role of I C W A ' . M a l e a n d female students heard that a motion
which will effectively abolish I C W A is to be put to a U G M in the
near future.
Instead of just discussing the role of I C W A , a lot of time was
spent o n the topic of why I C W A should exist at all. S o m e
suggested that it should become a social club, while others argued
that I C W A didn't need a special r o o m .
Students who were in favour of the abolition of I C W A a s k e d ,
" W h a t can it do that isn't covered by other college groups". T h e
I C W A committee defended their association a n d a decision was
made to send out a questionnaire to all w o m e n students at
Imperial. The exact question to be put will be decided at a meeting
this Friday Lunchtime.
NEW STUDENT PAPER
O n Wednesday a new newspaper was distributed at Imperial.
L o n d o n Student, w h i c h was formerly called Sennet, is edited by
Jackie Lewin. F E L I X interviewed Jackie and she explained w h y
S E N N E T had been renamed. T h e paper has to rely o n finance
from advertisers. S E N N E T had developed a bad name with
advertising agencies because of its unreliability. J a c k i e h o p e d that
L o n d o n Student would be issued every week a n d that the n a m e
would be more meaningful to advertisers.
LADIES RUGBY
Yesterday, the Evening N e w s came to the Ladies Rugby
practice and their article is likely to be printed next week.
The S U N is to feature the Ladies a n d any money that is earnt
from the papers will be put towards a Ladies Rugby Shirts F u n d . It
costs Â£100 to kit out the team with shirts.
N e x t Sunday Nationwide will be filming a match between the
Ladies of Imperial versus a team from University College.
T h e kick-off is at 11 a m , at Harlington. C o m e to the U n i o n
L o w e r Lounge at 9.00 a m if y o u would like to support your team.
O n c e again F E L I X has had to cope with production difficulties.
H o w e v e r , the immediate problems have been solved. T h e
newspaper has been drastically reduced in size and s o m e articles
have had to be left out.
It is Election time - S T O I C would like to hear from Sabbatical
election candidates in order to help them with their E l e c t i o n
promotions.
