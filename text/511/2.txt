Dear J o h n . - Following the article
concerning Liberal Students on
the back page of F E L I X last
week. I feel a lew points need some
clarification.
I certainly do not believe in
v o l u n t a r y m e m b e r s h i p s ol
student u n i o n s w i t h i n the
framework of society as it is
presently structured, but such a
concept is perfectly compatible
w i t h Liberal p r i n c i p l e s ol
individual freedom of choice.
Clearly such principles have to be
compromised with the equally
valid principle of collective
responsibility, and at present the
l a t t e r must surely be the
dominant factor.
Liberal policies should always
be seen in the context of striving
for an ideal Liberal society - and
I stress 'ideal' - and I believe that
eventually, if enough progress can
be made, voluntary membership
of student unions would fit neatly
into such a new society structure
with far more emphasis o n ,
freedom of choice lor individuals.
At present, however, it would
IK-
completely unworkable, and
student unions would no! be able
lo provide the wide range ol
sporting, recreational, represen-
tational and other services which
they do now. and would cease to
exist in any effective manner. I'd
be happy to elaborate on this at a
later date, but I thought it
important to clarify my position -
and indeed Liberal Students'
position - now. before any
misunderstanding could arise.
Yours sincerely.

Sir. - I a m prompted to write, by
the article on the back page of
today's edition concerning the
funding of Student Unions 'a
matter of great concern to F E L I X
itself. I am sure).
It would appear from your
article that an officer of the
Imperial College U n i o n , indeed
the incumbent of a post which I
once filled myself, and one who
aspires to high responsibilities,
has been advocating the policies
of M r s . Thatcher and a minority
of the Conservative Party, of
which I believe he is not a
member ( I a m prepared to In-
corrected in this belief).
It might at first appear
inconsistent lor an individual of
libertarian convictions, such as
myself, to oppose the concept of a
"closed shop" in industry, but to
support an apparently similar
s i t u a t i o n i n t h e s t u d e n t
c o m m u n i t y . B u t s u c h a
comparison would be unrealistic.
T h e Students' U n i o n is not only a
representational body, and in
that role it is not easily
demarcated from the administra-
tion of the College. It is, however,
more easilv "detachable" as the
principal source of social and
sporting life at IC.
O n e may be able to remain
a l o o f from the " p o l i t i c a l "
activities of I C U and apathetic
t o w a r d s t h e s p o r t s a n d
recreational clubs, but I would
opine (posh, prose, eh, John?) that
each member of a community has
an obligation to contribute
towards the facilities provided lor
the whole community; and as the
A m e r i c a n R e v o l u t i o n was
s u p p o s e d to p r o v e , those
contributions are inseparable
from the representation of the
contributors.
C a n one evaluate either (a) the
marginal cost of providing the
facilities per additional student
(alter capital expenditure on such
items as the U n i o n building,
common rooms. Sports Centre.
Boathouse. their fixtures and
provision of heat, light, etc. to
them; or the L n i o n print unit -
how much would you charge for
F E L I X to non-members. John?)
or (b) the mean cost per student ol
the entirety? If so. which of these
does M r . Lucock propose to
separate from tuition lees in order
that such a portion should In-
voluntary?
The voluntary membership of
Student Unions is a policy which
has been condemned by Liberal
Students for many years and
vigorously opposed within the
Conservative Party by F C S .
I have the honour. Sir, to
remain your most obedient and
devoted reader,

Dear Sir, - I certainly do not claim
to be the world's greatest
mathematician, but I am fairly
sure that 6 does not equal 14.
However, some people are apt to
disagree. D o w n in Southside
Refectory, deep in the heart ol
Mooneyland, extra vegetables arc
charged 14 p. Fair enough, this is
consistent with the general high
prices encountered there. But, if
you have just the meat dish and
chips, only 6 pence is deducted
from the price of your meal.
Then, as if enough salt has not
been rubbed into the deep wound
inflicted by refectory price
policies, if you are fool enough (as
I was, to substitute your cooked
vegetable with coleslaw (which is
only grass and grease) another 15
p is slapped onto your meal price.
This means that the cost of
lasagne, chips and coleslaw is a
sky-high 80 p. the latter being an
enormous 21 p. The consequence
of this, of course, is that whenever
students choose to eat a selection
of food that deviates from the
meals listed on the price-list.
Mooney profit margins soar to
even dizzier heights. If you
extrapolate this 'buying and
selling' price policy further, you
would expect to pay 28-p. for
walking past the till with an
empty plate!
W i t h such inconsistencies
within and between refectory
prices (80 p. would buy you a far
more wholesome meal in the
Sherfield Lower refectory) I
cannot understand the mentality
of such Mooneyphiles as Peter
K i r k h a m , who confessed to
breaking the boycott and actually
stated in his letter to F E L I X that
he found the quality "quite
reasonable". Even without the
issue of the use of the regulator, I
have e n o u g h ill-feelings to
support every future boycott the
U n i o n decides to stage as will, I
a m sure, the overwhelming
majority of I.C. students who can
certainly do without the likes of
Peter K i r k h a m .
Yours faithfully.

Dear Sir, - A l l the anti-
a b o r t i o n i s t s who have put
forward their beliefs in F E L I X so
far have been male, and this,
coupled with other factors, has
actually produced . a strong
enough reaction in me to make
me get oil my apathetic backside
and feply.
A lot of women who are
pregnant and do not wish to have
a child, do not want it from before
the moment it was conceived and
wish to have it aborted as early as
possible.
There is a form of abortion
called Menstrual Extraction
which can be carried out up to 17
days after a missed period. It uses
a small extraction tube (like a
syringe). It is done without
anaesthetic, and most women
only have a mild cramping
sensation afterwards. It is
normally used before the 10th day
the period's late so the women
wouldn't know if she was
pregnant anyway. So it can be
done without any heads being
thrown in buckets of bits of bodies
etc.
80% of abortions take place
before 12 weeks, when the baby is
about 3 " long with its knees bent
up-
II the woman does decide after
conception that she does not want
the child, it is for a good reason.
A b o r t i o n is a t r a u m a t i c
experience; it is not something she
wants to go through for the sheer
hell of it.'
I do not like society the way it is
and therefore believe strongly in
not bringing a child into this
world, because I wouldn't be able
to bring it up in the way I would
want to. X o woman should be
forced to have children if she is not
capable of bringing them up in
the way she would want to. A n d if
she. doesn't want a child she is the
last person who should be
bringing up part of the next
generation. Over half of the
140.000 legal abortions each year
are carried out on single women,
who presumably do not feel they
are capable of bringing a child up
properly.
Have the anti-abortionists
considered the case of a woman
becoming pregnant after rape?
Ought she to be forced to carry
that child for 9 months?
Finally I object to anyone
deciding that it is not my right to
decide whether I have a child or
not.

Dear Sir, - I am referring to Jamie
Shelter's letter in F E L I X 510
attacking homosexuality in the
name of the bible.
He admits that he couldn't see
a r e a s o n l o r p r o h i b i t i n g
homosexuality by law until he
had read the bible. Unfortunately
yet another latent open-minded
person is forced into the shakles of
ignorance using the fallacious
argument of authority.
Nothing makes the bible
absolutely 'true'. Interpretation
of the bible is also a matter of
personal perception. I believe
that where there is love; there is
good. The feelings of attraction
which we cannot explain or
understand are there to be
enjoyed - i f we are brave enough
to face them.
Yours faithfully,

Dear Sir. - I have read with
interest and in some cases
annoyance the letters that have
a p p e a r e d o n y o u r p a g e s
concerning, amongst other things
homosexuality and abortion,
from students w i t h strong
religious convictions. The letter
from M r . Shotter has finally
prompted me to make some
comments on the matter.
Personally I have no strong
objection to, or support for
homosexuality. As far as I can see
if one bloke wants to bugger
another in the privacy of
wheresoever they choose who are
we to obect? It's certainly not the
way I would' choose to spend an
evening but if it does not a i l e d me
in any way then why should I say
"no. you must not do this"? What
does annoy me is Godsquad
members who quote vast chunks
of the Bible (with references),
accompanied by comments such
as "look! G o d says you must not
do this". W h y is the Bible treated
as such an absolute standard, and
considered to be correct on all
matters, when large parts of it arc-
incorrect, contradictory and
u n p r o v e n ? P r e s u m a b l y M r .
Shotter does not believe the world
to have been created in seven days
so why then should he belives.
without question, that if " a man
