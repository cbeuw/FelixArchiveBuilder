ENVIROMENTAL
SOCIETY
Elections for committee posts
in the newly c o n s t i t u t e d
Environmental Society are to be
held at a meeting at 1:00pm on
March 12th in the centre for
Environmental Technology, 48
Princes' Gardens. Nomination
papers will be available from
Friday 2nd. March. We are
particularly anxious that people <
interested in environmental
matters who are from outside the
centre and who could help
continue the activities of the
society next year will stand. If you
are interested, why not join now at
the discount price of only 30p
(with talks, films and field trips sti II
to come), and if you wish to
discuss the aims of the society
and the responsibilities of
committee posts come to the
centre and talk to Paul Tomlinson,
Ros Atkins or David Trevor-
Jones.
The next Environmental
Society talk is entitled 'Resources
are What Really Matter' by Dr.
E y r e , S e n i o r L e c t u r e r in
Geography at Leeds and author of
'The Real Wealth of Nations',
which will be held in the centre, 48
Princes' Gardens at 4.30 on
Thursday March 8th.
DEBSOC
So far, This House' believes
that The box is mightier than the
bomb', that 'Mines freshers'
dinners are Sexist' and that
'Presidents and Sex-Kittens are
Mutually Exclusive'. It believes in
Father Christmas, although not in
Proportional Representation, it
supports the Campaign for
H o m o s e x u a l Equality, and
believes in Equal Opportunity. It is
to be hoped that its views on
Northern Ireland, Infinity,
Cannabis and the 'Role of Women'
will soon come to be known.
Last Thursday's motion was
'This House defends the right of
every student to remain aloof from
the activities of his/her Student
Union' and was proposed by Chris
Fox and Bernard Smith and
opposed by Jo Armitage and
Colin Palmer, both of whom made
a gallant effort without finding any
defence in which they really
believed! The motion was duly
passed after several floor
speeches from the large audience
(only one seat was empty).
Papers forthe 10committ.ee posts
go up soon and the AGM is on
March 22nd. See you at the last
MINIDEBATE on March 6th.
Mick Berry,
Chairman 1978-79

Thanks to Dayvilles for the
excellent organisation that made
the night a real stormcr. Although
I've only just recovered from the
Field C u p I won't have recovered
from the Guilds' Soccer 6's which
were held on Sunday. Twenty-
three teams - 138 people - turned
up to play, thanks to Clive
Whiteside's magnificent ability to
persuade people they were all
latent masochists. and a great
time was had bv all (Hit me. Hit
