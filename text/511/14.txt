Hyde Park Relay 79
I write this as I recover from the alcoholic
haze induced by the celebrations on
Saturday night following the completion of
yet another successful race. The medals have
been given to the right people (I hope!), and
the trophies sent to their lawful resting places
for this year. In brief this means that
Loughborough and Borough Road Colleges
(or as they prefer to be called, WLIHE) have
shared out the prizes between themselves.
Well what of the race? The start, at 3.00 p.m.
alongside the traditional lamp post, was its
usual stampede as 120 runners carved a path
for themselves through the Saturday
afternoon crowds (no injuries have been
reported, luckily).
The race was really on! On the third lap
Sebastian Coe of Loughborough, finding his
team second, decided to alter placings with
the leaders WLIHE. However, John Davies,
had other ideas. The two of them proceeded
to set the race alight. At the end of the lap
John Davies stormed away from Coe to finish
ahead. In fact this sprinting gave John the
time of 13 mins 17 sees, a new record, for the
three mile course. Sebastian Coe crawled in,
defeated, in the second fastest time of the
day.
The start of the Hyde Park Relay
Later on, in the final lap, Loughborough
finally achieved their aim and got ahead of
WLIHE. Incidentally Leeds were third. The
first foreign team home was the Katholique
Universitet Leuven (Belgium) in 9th place.
Just to show you how keen some of these
foreigners are, one guy from that team was
running in Germany on Sunday afternoon
having caught the overnight ferry.
Concerning foreign teams we were
gratified by the massed arrival of 20 such
teams.
W h a t a b o u t o u r o w n t e a m ? W e l l
urn....er...Mick Kelly was not on his best form.
Steve Kirk ran somewhat better and Gary
Longhurst, who is still, improving, ran a
c r e d i t a b l y fast time. H o w e v e r Geoff
Sherwood was not so fast. Bryan Acford,
P. Joliffe (Thames Poly) Keith Marshall at The Presentation
Dave Clarke (WLIHE)
recovering from the sight of C o e and Davies
nipped round quickly to hand over to Ian
Morton who ran, in his usual inimitable style,
to finish off the team in 46th.
Meanwhile your Captain, Ian Alvey, was
running for the college old boys. (Yes I have
retired). His time can be found on the club
notice board.
Finally a word of thanks to Steve Kirk for
disorganising the foreign teams, to all club
members for helping. A n d finally thanks to
Lady Flowers for presenting the prizes, Mr.
Eric Ratcliffe "Assistant Regional Director of
the national Westminster Bank" not manager
as stated (sorry!) for presenting the Nat.West.
Trophy and to St.Marys College Twickenham
for being such good sports, as we could not
give them a trophy we did not have, but
should have had.
P.S. Many thanks to IC Photographic
Society for the photographs taken.
