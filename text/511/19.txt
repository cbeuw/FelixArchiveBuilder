JUDO-lmperial Win
Last Sunday saw six teams from five colleges gather in the
Great Hall for the first Imperial College J u d o Invitation
Tournament. Despite a scheduled start of 10:00, the first match
didn't get under way until 11:00. A g o o d thing too, since most of
the IC contingent didn't arrive until 10:15.
T h e t e a m s w e r e d i v i d e d into two p o o l s of three, with the top
two f r o m e a c h p o o l g o i n g into the s e m i - f i n a l s . In the first p o o l
(IC 2 n d s , K i n g s , C h e l s e a ) , K i n g s m a d e it a b u n d a n t l y c l e a r that
they w e r e after the t r o p h y . A l t h o u g h t h e y w e r e two m e n short,
t h e y w o n b o t h their m a t c h e s 3-2. T h e final m a t c h in the p o o l
started w e l l for IC, with D a v e B r o w n w i n n i n g his fight with a fine
h o l d d o w n . H o w e v e r , e v e n the a p p e a r e n c e of B a r r y W a r e i n g ' s
n a k e d legs w h e n his kit r i p p e d (and of S t e v e W r i g h t ' s after he
g e n e r o u s l y l o a n e d B a r r y his t r o u s e r s ) c o u l d n ' t s a v e IC; t h e y
lost the r e m a i n i n g fights to g o d o w n 4-1.
The second pool (IC 1sts, Q M C ,
Q E C ) provided a completely
different story. Imperial College
a b s o l u t e l y a n n i h i l a t e d t h e
opposition. Owen Tutty put IC
into the lead against Q E C with a
very good shoulderthrow. The
other members of the team
followed this up with a succession
of hold downs to win the match 5-
0. Against Q M C , Owen again gave
IC the lead, this time with a hold
down. Brian Clarke put IC two# up
w i t h p r o b a b l y t h e m o s t
spectacular win of the comp-
etition- a superbly executed hip
throw after less than a minute. The
rest of the team won their fights to
give IC a second 5-0 victory. With
Q M C winning their match against
Q E C , the semi-final line up was
Kings vs Q M C , Chelsea vs IC 1sts.
R e a l i s i n g that there w a s
a c h a n c e of f i n i s h i n g the
tournament before Stan's Bar
closed, the teams opted to carry
on straight away. The first semi-
final gave K i n g s their 3-2
victory, but the second was more
of a nail biter, with some fine judo
from both sides. In the end, wins
by Owen Tutty, Tony Hall and
Nigel Blott carried IC through.
After a five-minute break to
allow IC a chance to get their
breath back, the final began.
Kings won the first fight, but then
Nigel won his fight with a choke
hold. This gave ICan unassailable
3-1 lead and, despite losing the
last fight, the trophy.
I would like to than k all those
who helped in the organisation
and running of the tournament,
especially Steve O'Connor and
Jeff W a l k e r for r e f e r e e i n g ,
timekeeping and scoring. Special
thanks go to IC Red Cross Society
for providing the medical cover.

Snooker Poem
There is a short guy from Mauritious,
Whose snooker is tastefully delicious,
He tries 24 hours a day to play,
Perhaps wanting to beat Higgins one day,
And that certainly is ambitious.
When sitting on a toadstool he feels at home,
With pipe and fishing rod he likes to roam,
On a table he climbs to give deep screw,
To sink many a ball with his cue,
His'name, you know, is the laughing gnome
He has a friend with an infamous shot,
Who guarantees to fluke every pot,
He thumps the ball hard to start a frame,
Never needing even to take aim,
Then flukes a snooker and laughs a lot- yaahf
