N o w what made a normally sentient a n d
logical boy like me stand for I.C. President?
It's not exactly the kind of activity that most
people associate me with (when they
associate me with any kind of activity at all).
Perhaps I can't find a job or I'm failing my
degree and just want somewhere to hang
around for a year until I can fool some
unsuspecting firm to take me, with the title
providing me with a little more hope.
Perhaps I just want another pot in the U n i o n
bar and to increase my pulling power.
Perhaps I just want thejob for the hall place it
provides, or the grant without any lectures to
go to. Perhaps I just want the fame.
These are all good enough reasons for
standing, and I must admit that all these
crossed my mind. In fact if some of these perks
didn't exist you'd find it hard to find anybody
to stand who wasn't an out and out
masochist, whereas I'm much better known
for my sadistic tendencies. Nevertheless, a
little genuine motivation never d i d anyone
any harm and I've got a scrap of it
somewhere. Without being sentimental, I've
really enjoyed the past three years here, and
have always at least tried to get involved in
both I.C. U n i o n and the C . C . U . s . A year
without lectures gelling in the way of that
involvement seems custom built. I'm not a
power liend. the President does not run I.C.,
he coordinates it. I know I've got the ability
to do thai. I hope I can make you believe that.

Hon. Sec.
CANDIDATE: Bernard Smith
PROPOSER: Pete Davis
Okay then why vote for Bernard?
Well basically because he knows what the
job entails, and he can do the job best. T h e
Honorary Secretary has many jobs to do but
fundamentally he r a n be seen as an
administrator. He'has to co-ordinate all the
paperwork of the U n i o n . However the H o n .
Sec. is a sabbatical post and as such the
students should get the most out of him. After
all we are paying his salary!
Well Bernard should have little trouble
with the administration. H e knows exactly
how difficult the j o b of secretary can be: he
was the R . C . S . U . R a g secretary in his first
year, and is R . C . S . U . Academic Affairs
secretary this year, as well as being Physics
Departmental Representative, Bernard is
also able to work with secretaries, very
important if reports on meetings are to be
prepared on time.
As a sabbatical the H o n . Sec. must be able
to work with College Authorities. Bernard is
at present doing this through his work on the
six college committees on which he sits. So if
you want an H o n . Sec. who will achieve
something for students vote for Bernard.
Pete Davis
Well why me?
I believe I can do the job well and I want to
do a lot for the students at Imperial. I hope to
see higher attendances at next year's U n i o n
Meetings by getting the U n i o n to do things
which benefit the majority of students. T h e
U n i o n should be more interested in the
average student; it is they I want to help. I
won't make any easy promises to you, except
that I want to look at facilities for students in
five to ten years time. I believe in looking to
the future. I hope you will all use your vote,
one way or another.

FELIX Editor
CANDIDATE: Colin Palmer
PROPOSER: Jill Dawson
R S M W i n Bottle M a t c h .... T h e news
report in today's F E L I X is important for
Mines and especially the teams a n d
supporters who experienced the match. As
Editor of F E L I X I will include much more
space for the coverage of such events and will
make it a priority to include photographs to
accompany the news stories.
At Imperial, after spending hours
attending lectures and writing coursework,
students need to relax. T h e Drake's Seven
cartoon is the most popular feature in
F E L I X ! I understand the importance of
including political articles and I will make
their layout attractive. T o balance them I
will include more lighter material ... more
cartoons, a regular crossword a n d amusing
news stories that cover the fun side of college
life.
M y experience as a journalist has included
writing for my local newspaper while serving
a four year apprenticeship in industry. I have
been a scriptwriter for S T O I C and appear on
I C R a d i o by reviewing their review of
F E L I X . I've written many news items for
F E L I X covering events involving students
from overseas, stories from the halls of
residence, rag events and C C U activities. I
write the D a y By D a y page jointly with Jill
Dawson. It contains more than just headline
news and I hope many students enjoy reading
it. M u c h time is spent making the layout ol
the page as interesting as possible.
There aren't enough photographs in
F E L I X . Dozens of my Polaroid photos have
been included and when elected Editor I will
use the F E L I X camera and develop prints in
the college darkrooms as well as using a few
Polaroid photos for ihe last minute news.
M y interests include composing music by
computer. As F E L I X editor I will make sure
that musical events, at Imperial, will receive
the fullest coverage.
