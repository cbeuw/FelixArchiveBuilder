IC lsts 15 SIDCUP 2nds 10
Sorry about not writing this u p last week but you know how
it is (?).
A good w i n this but I can't r e m e m b e r m u c h about it since it
was so long ago.
As usual with club sides Sidcup were heavy i n the forwards but
lacking in any real skill in the backs and as a result this match turned
out to be a predominantly forwards game. This resulted in the usual
fights etc. culminating in one of their forwards being sent off(thank G o d
he was too- a real animal!).
We had drafted in H u w Price-Stevens and Mines' skipper Simon
Potter for the match due to another abundance of injuries and these two
players managed to retain quite a strong line up for us.
Early on in the game H u w was injured and had to go off leaving the
effervescent Steve Dobney to stand in at scrum-half. Although Steve
seems to end up as utility m a n in these situations he put on an excellent
display and one wonders whether or not he should make scrum-half his
regular position. I can see his 'beard' swelling as he reads this so I'll go
on to other things!
I can't remember who scored so apologies to those who did, but I do
remember that the tries scored were all good ones- ie mostly team tries
ending up with the winger scoring etc. T o sum up, a good performance
from everyone and i n particular from S. Potter.

What do you mean why are I C
lsts playing a fourth team!
The facts behind the matter are
that Rosslyn Park brought the
wrong team along- due to a mix-

secretaries the day before (Steve
Dobney wishes to state that it was
totally their fault!)
Anyway, as is to be expected
with top class clubs there is not
much difference in the standards
of their sides below the second
team, so we still had a hard match
in the offing.

The second half continued

THIRDS OFF THE
WINNING TRAIL
I.C. Ill 2 vs Q.M.C. II 2
Sat 24th February
On Saturday the thirds' tour of scenic soccer grounds brought them
to Ditchleys, the Q.M.C. ground in deepest Essex. Skipper Dave Hall
was in such a rush to breathe in the country air, that he took 2
goalkeepers and Stu Dillon with him by mistake. At 3 o'clock a car load
of thirds players arrived to complete the team. They had had trouble
asking the way, as none could speak, nor understand the local dialect!
A hard-fought game followed Even Skipper Hall is giving up
with Q.M.C. scoring 3 minutes
from the kick-off and 3 minutes
from the final whistle. In between,
Mo Misra and Dave McPhail
scored the I.C. goals, with Dave
also hitting the crossbar. I.C.
dominated the second half a n d
this can be regarded as a point
lost rather than a point gained!

THIRDS BACK ON THE
WINNING TRAIL
I.C. Ill 3 vs. U.C. Ill 0
Wed. 21st February
Dave Hall called 'heads', and the fate of John Shuttleworth was
decided; he was promoted from the fourths to the thirds, to bring their
number to 8. 3 hockey players were quickly signed up to complete the
team, and we set off for that northern outpost of London soccer,
Shenley.
I.C. 5ths 1:0 Birkbeck III
With Steve Veats looking
completely in control the only
danger to the Fifth's appeared
to be John Healy, but despite
his usual erratic driving,
e l e v e n F i f t h t e a m e r s
arrived, intact, at Birkbeck's
ground to do 'battle'.
The Fifth's took an early lead
when a line run by M o Misra. in
his debut game, carved u p the
Birkbeck defence a n d from the
resulting cross Aled Phillip's
buried the ball in the back of the
net. H a v i n g seen what the Filth's
were capable of. if allowed to play
football. Birkbeek realised the
best solution was to kick anything
that moved, and for much of the
rest of the match were allowed to
do so by a fairly weak referee.
In the second half a good goal
from M o Misra following some
clever interplay by M a r k Clegg
and Steve Kaye was disallowed
In the referee who now seemed to
be deteriorating rapidly. Apart
from these isolated incidents of
football, ruining what could have
been a very good clogging match
for Birbeck, particular credit
must go to Steve M c P h a i l a n d
i A d a m Esberger who proved not
ionly adapt at playing football but
I also very handy at mixing it when
required. As for A l Cable, the
Fifths mild mannered sweeper
and captain, the whole game
seemed a long way removed from
the normal Shakespeare recital.
Before finishing, it must be
mentioned that M o M i s r a , a n d
Russ Gilbert, in goal, both
played exceptionally well on their
debut games, a n d Steve, Jaws,

Several hours later: -
Dave Hall called 'heads', and
elected to play uphill. The first 20
minutes saw the thirds trying a
daring new plan. They attacked
instead of defending! This so
confused U.C. that they mounted
only one real attack in the first
half. Fortunately keeper George
Okuniewski woke up in time to
push the ball against the post.
At half time, it was decided, over
oranges, to continue with this rare
new policy of attack. Five minutes
later, Giles Brereton scored.
Instead of fainting in amazement,
the team played on and John
Shuttleworth scored our second.
Our unimaginative opponents
decided they would copy us and
try attacking themselves. After a
few minutes of practice they
became quite good at it, and hit
the crossbar. Lito Rich thought
they needed another demonstra-
tion of how to score, and promptly
put the ball in their net. Full time
i came, and it was hard to tell which
side was more shocked with the
final score.
Sadly ITV lost their recording of
this epic game and had to show
the Wrexham vs. Spurs cup-tie
that evening instead.

Hall, Des McGuckin, Giles
