U G M Supports Cannabis
and G a y Rights
IC Union has come out in favour of legalising pot and is to
affiliate to the "Legalise Cannabis C a m p a i g n " .
The Union is also to press for the Haldane L i b r a r y to stock
" G a y News", following votes taken at Tuesday's Union
Meeting. " G a y N e w s " is the fortnightly newspaper for
homosexuals which was recently fined £1500 for blasphemy.
U n i o n Secretary M i k e Elkin, proposing his motion on cannabis, said
that there was no evidence that smoking pot was harmful, nor that it led
to the use of hard drugs. Q u o t i n g several Government reports in favour
of its legalisation he appealed to U n i o n members to support the motion
lor the sake of the 5 million people who, he said, had tried cannabis and
liked it.

Speak-In Successful
Last Sunday saw the opening
shots in IC Union's tuition fees
campaign with a 5 and a half hour
"speak-in" at Speakers' Corner.
Fourteen people mounted the
soap box in turn to put the Union's
case for charging overseas'
students the same rate as home
students and keeping fees at their
present level.
To emphasise the cause of
overseas' students there were
speeches in Chinese, Hindi and
Dutch, as well as English.
There was no press response
but plenty of people appeared to
be listening and the speakers
received some attention from
regular hecklers.
A n amusing incident occurred
when Scott Murray and Rick Ellis
decided that Mike Elkin was too
small and went to rectify the
situation by "borrowing" another
speaker's soap box.
A problem arose when the other
speaker discovered the loss and
sought to retrieve his property,
resulting in Mike Elkin being
literally swept off his feet.
The organiser of the speak-in,
External Affairs Officer Sheyne
Lucock, said that it had been a
worthwhile exercise in that the
speakers had become more aware
of the arguments and issues. He
had not expected to convince a lot
of people but considered the
action a success.
The tuition fees campaign is
continuing with daily lobbies of
M P s despite a recent discovery by
Sheyne that Parliament is not
sitting until March 5th because of
the devolution referendums.
The meeting defeated an
amendment proposed by Colin
Palmer. H e was against the
legalising of cannabis because not
enough was known about its long
term effects. There were enough
legal drugs, like tobacco and
alcohol already.
Barry Austin also referred to
tobacco in his speech against the
motion pointing out that before
the war tobacco was thought to be
harmless. H e was concerned
about the effect of pot on driving.
M i k e E l k i n maintained that
there had been extensive research
on cannabis. O n a vote the
motion was carried.
G A Y R I G H T S
The motion on gay rights,
proposed by IC G a y Society
C h a i r m a n Bob Rigby, called for
school sex education to include
information about gay relation-
ships and opposed the ban on G a y
News by W . H . Smith.
It also called for an end to the
refusal of some newspapers to
print advertisements for gay
organisations and asked I C U n i o n
to place such an advertisment to
see whether it was accepted.
The call for Haldane L i b r a r y to
stock G a y News was added by
U n i o n President M a r y Attenbo-
, rough.
The meeting erupted into
hilarity when Barry Austin,
speaking aginst parts of the
m o t i o n r e f e r r e d to s c h o o l
education on gay rights as
"ramming it down their throats". H e
did not appear to understand the
joke.
Despite a speech by T o n y
Leech who, referring to the Bible,
c l a i m e d t h a t h o m o s e x u a l
relationships were wrong, the
motion was almost entirely
c a r r i e d . O n l y a s e c t i o n
supporting the right to " A I D "
(artificial insemination by donor)
for lesbians proved unacceptable
to the U n i o n and was defeated.
O L D P O L I C Y
External Affairs Officer Sheyne
L u c o r k proposed a motion
dealing with the updating of old
U n i o n policies. T h e meeting
agreed to his proposal.
Policy of three years ago will
now be brought to the attention of
a U n i o n meeting. It will be
automatically ratified unless any
amendments are put forward, in
which case discussion will take
place at a subsequent meeting.
The meeting adjourned at 2.35
p m leaving two motions on the
agenda, one on " T i m e and Celtic
Discrimination", the other on J o b
Recruitment for South Africa.

Discussion took place on a
proposal to be put to College's
