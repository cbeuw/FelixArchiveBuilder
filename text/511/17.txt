Dep.
President
CANDIDATE: Malcolm Brain
PROPOSER: Sean OBoyle
The Deputy President is the most diverse
and difficult job in the Union, and a good
candidate must have a wide range of personal
attributes. H e should be able to c o m m a n d
sufficient respect to capably deal with
difficult disciplinary situations in the U n i o n ,
whilst at the same time being a popular and
well-known figure to whom people feel they
can go and talk to easily. He needs to have the
ability to speak well at various College
committees in order to represent our
interests. Above all else, he must be sincere
and trustworthy.
The post will be sabbatical next year, and
will incorporate the job of H o n . J u n i o r
Treasuer and much of the financial work at
present done by permanent staff and
voluntarily by the H o n . Senior Treasurer. T o
ensure that this is done properly, we
desperately need someone with considerable
knowledge of the Union.
This year, M a l c o l m has proved he has the
personality which had made him an excellent
D.P.. and he undoubtedlv has the necessary
experience. This, together with his ready
sense of wit and good humour must surely
make h i m the ideal candidate.
G a r y Nichols
Next year, I will give priority to the
following issues which should be the D.P.'s
responsibility. L o n d o n Student Travel: M o r e
attention must be given to L S T . both to
protect our investment in it and to provide a
worthwhile service.
Discount Scheme: Since we can no longer use
the N U S discount service, 1 propose to set up
a local discount scheme.
Redecoration: I intend to continue the
programme ol redecorating U n i o n areas
(much of which 1 have initiated this year).
Safety: 1 would undertake to be the student
representative on a l l C o l l e g e safety
committees.
M o r e details of these and other matters will
be given in a leaflet which I shall be
publishing soon.
