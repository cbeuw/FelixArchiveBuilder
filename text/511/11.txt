An Alternative Society
In (his article we approach y o u not as citizens of one country but as world
socialists speaking to fellow meml>ersol the w o r k i n g class. O u r appeal is based on
the recognition that capitalism is world-wide a n d that the workers of the world
have a m u t u a l interest i n t a k i n g action to abolish it a n d establish Socialism.
T h e Socialist Party of Great Britain is a n independent organisation opposed ic
the British L a b o u r P a r t y a n d all other parties in this country. It is associated with
c o m p a n i o n Socialist Parties a n d groups in A u s t r a l i a . C a n a d a , Jamaica, Ireland.
N e w Z e a l a n d , the U . S . A . a n d Austria.
T h e independence of the Socialist Party o f Great Britain a n d its c o m p a n i o n
parties rests o n the fact that o u r object a n d o u r views o n economic a n d polite al
questions are quite different from those of other political parties w h i c h c l a i m to
be socialist.
Capitalism or Socialism
W e live i n a system o f society k n o w n as capitalism.
U n d e r capitalism we get the things we need i n order to live - food, clothing,
housing, travel, entertainment etc. - only by b u y i n g them. T h e y arc all produced
in order to Ix* sold at a profit. W h a t each i n d i v i d u a l c a n b u y depends o n how
m u c h money he has. T h e life o f leisure a n d luxury enjoyed by the rich few is far
removed1
from the laborious a n d insecure existence of the great majority. U n d e r
capitalism this contrast of riches a n d poverty is universal. The privileged
minority, either through direct ownership of property, o r through
nationalisation o r State capitalism (as in m a n y countries i n c l u d i n g Russia),
share i n the proceeds ol the exploitation of the mass of the population in every
country i n the world.
T h e object of the Socialist P a r t y of Great Britain, in c o m m o n w i t h its
c o m p a n i o n parties, is to replace capitalism by a world-wide social system -
Socialism - i n w h i c h the means o f production a n d distribution will cease to be .
privately owned a n d will pass to the whole c o m m u n i t y . This will b r i n g to an end
the present competition l o r markets a n d sources of r a w materials between the
different countries w h i c h causes international rivalries a n d leads to war. In a '
socialist society articles w o u l d be produced solely for the use of m a n k i n d . A l l
forms of income derived from exploitation (rent, interest a n d profit) would
disappear. T h e problem to be tackled by a socialist society w o u l d be that ol
organising the able-bodied population to co-operate in * p r o d u c i n g food,
clothing, houses a n d all the articles a n d services needed for the full life of h u m a n
beings. A H will have free access to the things needed, production a n d distribution
being i n accordance w i t h the socialist principle: " F r o m each according to his
ability: to each according to his need".
Socialism cannot be brought about inside the capitalist system. O n e social
system must be replaced by the other and Socialism is necessarily world-wide.
Social Reforms do not lead to Socialism
T h e r e is only one road to Socialism, a n d the policy of dealing with social
problems one b y one is useless from the socialist stand-point. T h e object of
socialists is to achieve a fundamental change i n the basis on w h i c h society is
constructed. Whatever elfect reforms m a y have i n ameliorating particular evils
thev fail because they cannot b r i n g about the necessary fundamental change.
A m o n g the problems facing the w o r k i n g class are unemployment, rising
prices, the insufficiency of wages and the shortage of decent housing. These same
problems were also harassing workers 50 a n d a 100 years ago. T h e workers'
struggle to improve their l i v i n g standards goes o n but the problems will never be
solved under capitalism.
T h e Socialist Party of Great Britain recognises the importance of keeping up
the struggle over wages a n d w o r k i n g conditions but this is not enough; it still
leaves unchallenged the hold of the capitalists on the means of production a n d
distribution.
T h e Socialist Partv of Great Britain does not support nationalisation, properly
called State capitalism. Nationalisation is not Socialism a n d does not lead to
Socialism.
The Road to Socialism
Socialism cannot come about until the majority understand a n d desire it a n d
democratically take the steps necessary to achieve it. T h e socialist majority,
using the vote to gain control of the political machine, will use that control to
introduce the fundamental social changes required in the interests of the h u m a n
race. The control of the State machine necessary tor Socialism cannot be
achieved by strikes, general strikes, or insurrection.
Because social reforms cannot lead to Socialism, (he Socialist Party of Great
Britain restricts its memlx*rship to those w h o are convinced socialists, a n d does
not admit people w h o are interested merely i n lessening the evils of the capitalist
system.
The S.P.G.B. and Leadership
T h e breaking of election promises by other political parties is inevitable while
capitalism lasts, but even if all their promises were kept it w o u l d still leave
capitalist exploitation intact.
T h e Socialist Partv o f Great Britain has never made promises that it would
solve the problems of the w o r k i n g class w i t h i n capitalism.
$ N o r does the Socialist Party of Great Britain oiler to act as leaders. Leaders
cannot solve the workers" problems. T h e workers have to solve their o w n
problems b y m a k i n g the ellbrt necessary to understand h o w capitalism works,
a n d h o w it must be replaced by Socialism.
W h a t is required is not trust in leaders a n d their promises but a n attitude of
self-reliance a n d the determination to understand the nature of the problems
themselves. T h e w o r k i n g class, the vast majority of people, has the great task of
achieving Socialism a n d thus enabling the h u m a n race to tke a step forward in
social progress.
T h e world you live in, like the one your forefathers lived in, brings you little
more than h a r d work, insufficient wages a n d insecurity. Is this all y o u want, a l l
you are prepared to bequeath to your children, when a world free from those and
other problems is within your grasp? L e a v i n g the job of understanding a n d
acting to others gets you nowhere.
Those who w o u l d be free of insecurity and the tribulations of capitalism must
themselves understand a n d join with their fellow-workers to take the action that
will obtain their mutual emancipation. It is the only effort that will bring
worthwhile results.
A t the formation of the Socialist Party of Great Britain an Object a n d
Declaration of Principles were drafted a n d adopted as the basis of the
organisation. Admission to membership is dependent on acceptance a n d
understanding of the Object and Principles. T h e original draft has been retained
without alteration because no change has taken place i n the structure of
capitalism calling for a change in the statement of the socialist a i m a n d
principles.
Where We Stand
Socialists belong to a single world movement for the achievement oi Socialism
by majority democratic action through the ballot. Socialists do not support or
collaborate with any of the governments or political parties of capitalism, a n d
refuse to take sides in captitalist wars a n d quarrels which set worker against
worker. There is only one w o r k i n g class a n d only one socialist attitude.
Disputes about frontiers, campaigns to capture markets for exports or to
restrict imports, a n d demands for barriers i n the way of i m m i g r a t i o n or
emigration are capitalist issues. Socialists do not allow themselves to be d r a w n
into such capitalist quarrels as those about frontiers - between East a n d West
G e r m a n y , Italy and Austria. N o r t h e r n and Southern Ireland, Israel and Egypt.
N o r t h a n d South V i e t n a m or any other of the so-called nationalist, religious or
language conflicts that divide the w o r k i n g class. Socialists do not support any of
the groupings of the capitalist world - British C o m m o n w e a l t h , E u r o p e a n
E c o n o m i c C o m m u n i t y , A m e r i c a n , Russian or Chiense power-blocs. T h e enemy
is capitalism in a l l countries.
Socialists are opposed to the senseless violence of rioting, b o m - t h r o w i n g a n d
guerilla warfare, which serve no interest except that of the capitalist reaction.

T H E SOCIALIST PARTY OF GREAT BRITAIN
OBJECT:
The establishment of a system of society based upon the common
ownership and democratic control of the means and instruments for
producing and distributing wealth by and in the interest of the whole
community.
D E C L A R A T I O N O F P R I N C I P L E S
The Socialist Party of Great Britain holds:
1 That Society as at present constituted is based upon the ownership of the
means of living (i.e.. land, factories, railwavs, etc.) by the capitalist o r master
class, a n d the consequent enslavement of the w o r k i n g class, by whose labour
alone wealth is produced.
2 That in society, therefore, there is a n antagonism of interests, manifesting itself
as a class struggle, between those w h o possess but do not produce, and those w h o
produce but do not possess.
3 That this antagonism can be abolished only by the emancipation of the
w o r k i n g class from the domination ol the masterclass, by the conversion into the
c o m m o n property of society of the means ol production a n d distribution, a n d
their democratic control by the whole people.
4 That as i n the order of social evolution the w o r k i n g class is the last class to
achieve its freedom, the emancipation of the w o r k i n g class will involve the
emancipation of all m a n k i n d without distinction of race or sex.
5 That this emancipation must be the work of the w o r k i n g class itself
6 T h a t as the machinery of government, i n c l u d i n g the armed forces of the
nation, exists only to conserve the monopoly by the capitalist class of the wealth
taken from the workers, the w o r k i n g class must organise consciously a n d
politically for the conquest of the powers of government, national a n d local, in
order that this machinerv, i n c l u d i n g these forces, m a y be converted from an
instrument oi oppression into the agent of emancipation a n d the overthrow of
privilege, aristocratic a n d plutocratic.
7 That as all political parties are but the expression oi class interests, a n d as the
interest of the w o r k i n g class is diametrically opposed to the interests of all sections
of the master class, the partv seeking working-class emancipation must be hostile
to every other party.
8 T h e Socialist Party of Great Britain, therefore, enters the field of political
action determined to wage w a r against all other political parties, whether
alleged labour o r avowedly capitalist, a n d calls upon the members of the
w o r k i n g class of this country to muster under its banner to the end that a speedy
termination m a y be wrought to the system w h i c h deprives them of the fruits of
their labour, a n d that poverty m a v give place to comfort, privilege to equality,
and slavery to freedom.
