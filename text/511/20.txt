What You Will
" A s Y o u Like It" by W i l l i a m
Shakespeare. A l d w y c h Theatre by the
R o y a l Shakespeare C o m p a n y .
Perhaps I could he accused of dogma I ism:
alter all. this is the third seventeenth century
work I have reviewed in three weeks, but it
was. on the other hand, a very good century
for plays.
The production is a return to the rather
more traditional style, with well designed
backdrops and a great deal of stage masking:
gimmicks are kept to a bate m i n i m u m .
Inuendos based on modern interpretation ol
olde speech are non-existent a n d a genuine
approach has been adopted, striving more
towards accuracy than commerce. T h e music
of Stephen O l i v e r ( T o m Jones. T h e Duchess
of Mali] etc.) is subtle and manages to convey
an atmosphere appropriate to the era and the
various scenes, and confirms my belief that [
there is really no substitute for live music
written specifically for the work in question.
In this play. Shakespeare's wit is keen and
quick; so much so that by the time the
intricacies of one line have been mentally
sorted, there have already passed several
more, and this is particularly true of the
dialogue between Jaques a n d Touchstone
(once again the wit and fool duette) played
with masterful skill by someone whom the
programme just didn't quite- get round to
mentioning (apparently) and A l a n David
v respectively). Touchstone even had half the
audience joining in with the 'seven points of
an argument". I wasn't sure what to think
about that, but the fact is that at this point of
the play. Rosalind, who has been playing a
counterfeit m a n . has gone oil to change,
leaving both the characters (in the story) and
the audience (in fact) with nothing really
i m p o r t a n t to t h i n k a b o u t . H e n c e
Touchstone, in line with his profession,
commences to entertain both (so much that
Jaques, who must have been through it all
many times before, had difficulty getting his
lines out* afterwards, more due to his own
amusement than that of the audience). Both
of these characters would have "stolen the
s h o w " had it not been for Rosalind
(Charlotte Cornwell). N o w , whatever 1
thought about " R o c k Follies" (I must admit I
thought it was abysmal), it was almost
unbelievable for me to see such a superb
performance from someone I had always
associated with a T V failure.
M i c h a e l Bulman, who sings more than he
speaks. (Shakespeare evidently understood
that good actors and singers are seldom found
in" single entities), is a very good Amiens and
handled the music of Stephen Oliver with
apparent ease.
The one jar in the whole affair was the
sudden descent from the lly tower of a gaudy
celestial cloud-like configuration, which
whether intended to be realistic, symbolic or
whatever ruined (for about five minutes) a
very tasteful set. In spite of (his (insignificant)
observation, this is a play 1 can strongly
recommend).

At the start of the final race of the London
College's League, last Wednesday, IC had a
slender 29 point lead over both U C and LSE.
The race was held over our home course at
Petersham, in Richmond Park, and drew 120
starters. Yet again IC were dogged by injuries
and illness causing the absence of key first
team members. However, all was not lost, for
help was at hand from th e Royal College of
Music, as staff member Mick Fuller and Old
Boy Stu Littlewood arrived.
Despite his advancing years, Fuller still has
all the power and grace of a would-be
superstar, and he shot off with the leading
bunch, a n d was lying 2nd at the half-way
mark. Further down the field the remainder of
the team, with the exception of Gary
Longhurst, started slowly but were soon
forging through the field in fine style. The
conditions underfoot were nearly perfect and
were favourable to fast times. Fuller lost a
place o n the final hill but still came 3rd in 27-
20 (thus gaining a mention in the Daily Mail)
Next home was Ian Morton in an astonishing
28-40 (14th place) slashing one minute off his
best for the course. The trusty Littlewood was
on top form a n d came in 18th, just ahead of
Mark Pickard 20th. Steve Kirk caught a bug
and had a poor run to c o m e in 23rd
completing the scoring 5 in the 'A' team. A
short distance behind, Brian Acford and Mick
Kelly had ploughed through from the back
and caught the fith U C runner in the final
200yds, finishing 31st and 32nd respectively.
Gary Longhurst had the 'Run of His Life' and
came home 41st in what was once again a
personal best time. He was closely followed
by the improving Geoff Sherwood in 48th.
Maurice Wilson was making yet another
comeback after injury and did well to c o m e in
55th, followed by Ian Alvey in 71st and Mark
Thwaites 77th, completing the ' B ' team. Ian
did particularly well considering that he had
already run 10 miles in order to mark both the
mens' a n d womens' couses. For only the
second time this year we fielded a ' C team
which included the improving T i m Hayward
83rd, Miriam Rosen (who shunned the
s h o r t e r L a d i e s ' race) 104th a n d the
determined Francis Smith 115th.
In this race IC were narrowly beaten by U C ,
but had enough in hand to win the league
overall. Over the season 28 educational
establishments in the London area have
c o m p e t e d a n d v i c t o r y w a s a f i n e
achievement. Just to emphasise our strength
in depth, the 'B' team finished 6th, which was
a superb performance. Would we have won
without Mike and Stu?- Yes, but only by 3
points in 1900! Still allgood things come to an
end, for IC put up a dismal performance in the
Hyde Park Relay-but that's different story....

Sunday saw the return of the R.C.S. Rugb,
Sevens, after two years absence due to
adverse weather. It was a beautiful day and
the combatants were gathered early in Beit
Quad, many of them suffering from
hangovers owing to adverse drinking habits.
Nicky Morton, in particular, was still "fairly
gone", having breakfasted on white shield.
The tournament started at about twelve
with nine teams whose extravagant names
varied from Wedgie's Wankers to Fox's
Hounds. The teams were split into two groups
and played on a league basis. Early on in the
day the Wankers found themselves in hot
water against the experienced but ponderous
Hounds. The Hounds in turn foundered
versus the expert life sci "Allstars", whilst the
luckless Physics 1 gave a brave but doomed
performance in every match. Meanwhile in
the other group, where competition was, I
felt, a little more fierce, Maths 1 and R.C.S.
Rugby Captain Andy Baker's team (Baker's
half dozen), rose to their own respective
levels of incompetence. Myer's Maestros
(Chem 1) won all their matches without
conceding a score and easily qualified, for
the semi-finals as did Selkirk Hall (led by
J o h n Parkes) by virtue of a narrow win
against Morton's Motleys. The Motleys were
undoubtedly hampered by an inability to
score (esp on the wing).
In the semis the Allstars overcame the
Selkirk team, but only just and the spirited
C h e m 1 beat the, by now much substituted,
pack of Fox's. The final was a very close and
exciting match with the score tied at six all
(one try and conversion apiece) so the
outcome of the day was decided on "Next
score wins". Eddie Budgen immediately burst
through with a fine run enabling one of his
colleagues (whose name unfortunately
escapes me) to score, the Life Sciences
Allstars thus winning. Plenty of beer followed
in the bar with almost everyone having had a
superb day out. Long live the Sevens!
Special credit must go to Liz Lindsay for
coping with the league tables and paperwork
all afternoon. Thanks also to the poor
referees including Chris Fox, Hugh Barrett
and Martin Black. The day must have been
made the great success it was by its
organisers Nick Morton and Andy Baker.

CLUB
A n unusually late start and a bright
and sunny m o r n i n g contributed to I.C.
Orienteering Club's large turnout last
Sunday for the 'Concorde Chase' at
Hermitage.
In the M 1 9 A course K e n Warren ran well,
but below his best, completing the course in
about 80 mins., with Gary Longhurst
finishing some 20 mins. behind h i m .
C l u b Captain, veteran A n d y Qiiieklall
moved up to M 2 1 A with great success,
apparently so demoralising Steve K i r k with
his speed that the latter retired.
Sunday's hero was probably Nigel W a r d
who broke 100 mins on M 2 1 B , while M i c k
Berry completed an extensive tour of the
forest and arrived at the M 1 9 B finish as it was
being taken down - his time of 2 Ins was
matched by A l a n M i n n e y who had to retire
on the same course. Y o u lose some and you
lose some!
