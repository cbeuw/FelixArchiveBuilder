College has obtained another
house i n Evelyn Gardens which
will accommodate about twenty
students.
T h e house, number 53. was
hough) out of the surplus on the
College's residence account.
U n i o n president M a r y Attcu-
Ixirough hopes that students can
move i n i n October this year even
il" lull conversion work is not
complete-
Additional accommodation
available at that time will be
twenty five places at 9 Princes
Gardens. T h e Linstead H a l l
extension, expected to be ready in
1980. will provide space for a
further 76 students.
T I T L E A N N O U N C E D
Baron Flowers, of Queensgate
in the C i t y of Westminster, is the
full title chosen by the Rector,
following his elevation to the
peerage i n the N e w Year
Honours.
L o r d Flowers, as he will
generally be known, received his
W r i t of Summons to appear
before Parliament last week.
H e will be introduced to the
House of Lords on M a r c h 28th in
a ceremony i n w h i c h he will
appear dressed i n ermine and
supported by two peers of equal
rank. After the Summons has
been read to h i m he will have to
bow three times to the Throne
while walking backwards out oi
the Chamber.
U n t i l the ceremony he is not a
member of the Hoiise of Lords.
W h e n he becomes a member he
will not be able to take part in the
proceedings until he has made his
maiden speech.
H e hopes to make his maiden
speech this year as soon as the
opportunity arises, and will
attend the House of Lords when
he can. H e is. however, unlikely to
have m u c h time to do so in the
next twelve months, he told a
F E L I X reporter.

Crash pad is to close on M a r c h
8th when the remaining students
move into a U n i o n fiat.
This year crash pad has been
open almost continuously since
the beginning of the year to
accomodate students who were
forced out of their fiats.
T h e I C W A Lounge is the room
used by the students, a fact which
causes complaints from the
W o m e n i n S c i e n c e a n d
Technology group that the room
has not been available as a lounge
for women.
T h e L o u n g e is to be
r e d e c o r a t e d s h o r t l y . I C W A
President Daphne Websper is to
discuss the details with L a d y
Flowers and come up with a
colour scheme.

Six other students affected, who
have had their fees waived by
College, are no further in their
