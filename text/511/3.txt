lies with a male as with a woman,
both of them have committed an
abomination"?
Previous to writing this letter I
thought very hard and tried to
come up with a single reason why.
if this act is carried out in private
by consenting and responsible
adults, it should be wrong. I was
unable to do so. I challenge M r .
Shotter to give me just one reason
why it is wrong, that does not refer
to the Bible.
O n a small technical point, if
G o d is so m u c h against " m e n
lying with m e n " why did he
design the body in such a way as
to make it possible? M r . Shotter,
as an engineer, must surely be
aware ol' the advantages oi'
designing a structure in such a-
manner as to prevent its use in a
way other than that for which it is
intended.
I look forward to hearing a
r e p l y f r o m a n y of G o d ' s
representatives on Earth.
Yours faithfully.

Dear Sir. - We wish to reply, on
behalf of many regular customers,
to the letter published in last
w e e k ' s issue of " F E L I X "
complaining about the standard
of service in the U n i o n Bar. It is
not so m u c h the specific
complaint involved (about a hot-
dog, the story of which the
barman gives a rather different
account of than that given in the
letter), but rather the accusation
that "college bars are very keen lo lake
your money and offer yon no service in
return,no pleases or thankyous" which
we feel must be answered.
It is worth remembering that
the prices in bars are determined
by Refectory Committee and
have nothing to do with the bar
stall'. It is the opinion of countless
iregular customers, including
ourselves, that the staff do a
difficult job very well. We suggest
that the author of the letter may
care to ask someone who has
worked behind the bar just how
difficult a job it is before he
complains again.
Yours sincerely,
M a l c o l m Brain

Dear Sir. - I write in reply to
Jamie Shotter's letter in last
week's F E L I X , concerning his
v i e w on C h r i s t i a n i t y a n d
homosexuality.
Perhaps he would like to
consult the other (n-1) Christians
before pertaining to state their
views. Surely there as many gods
and facets of religion as there are
people.
He takes an example from
Leviticus in support of his view
that homosexuality is a sin and
abhorant to G o d (whose?). Literal
interpretation of the Bible is
â€¢dangerous ground - what of the
Genesis version of the Creation,
the laws of hygiene necessary lor a
nomadic dessert life, or the
imagery of Revelations? There
are many other examples.
A literal interpretation of
selected parts of the Bible might
be very well as a "first and last line
of defence in ally mailer of dispute",
but it ignores the conditions in
which it was written, or the
deeper, often hidden, meanings
and lessons. A n i n t e l l i g e n t
informed approach is more
productive, even if it requires
more effort.
Abandonment of the intellect
and a slavishness to the written
word should not be necessary lor
participation in spiritual matters.
Yours, with faith, hope and
c h a r i t y l o r the c e r e b r a l
hemispheres.
