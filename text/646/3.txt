road blocks would have been set
up outside the gates. Police
officers took the names of the
occupants of the van and
eventually turned up at the ICU
Office where it was only the
intervention of local policeman
Paul Goodison that prevented
arrests from being made. The
ICU Executive promised that
sanctions would be taken against
the mascotry team and that such
incidents would not occur again.
As a result of all this, Mr
Moore has been replaced as
Transport Officer by Frazer
Wiggley and Mr Fuller is to face
the Exec disciplinary committee
next Friday, which will decide
whether to take any disciplinary
actions against him. The maxi-
mum penalty that Mr Fuller
faces is a fine and a suspension
of privileges.
The Union has also decided
that vans are to be hired out to
RCSU only at the Executive's
discretion. RCSU officials claim
that such a decision is unreason-
able as Mr Fuller hired the van
for personal use, and are going
to put forward a motion to lift
the sanction at Friday's meeting.
The disciplinary committee on
Friday will consist of the

Executive: the Union President,
Deputy President and Honorary
Secretary plus the three CCU
Presidents. Mr Schmidt's resign-
ation however leaves Chas
Fuller as acting President of
RCSU, but he is expected to be
represented by another member
of his union at Friday's meeting.
John M c C a l l i o n , the I C U
Deputy President, has said that
he will offer his resignation if the
RCSU is not banned from using
Union vans at least until the end
of the session. Stephen Goulder
has told FELIX that he will also
consider resigning if the C C U
Presidents allow Mr Fuller to get
away with what he sees a
flagrant break of Union regula-
tions— Union vans are not
insured for use in mascotry, and
this was made clear after an
incident earlier this year when a
Union van was damaged at
Morphy Day.
Mr Schmidt told FELIX that
he had resigned as R C S U
President because Mr Fuller and
a number of mascoteers had
been prepared to ignore his
instructions—he had not been
consulted about the mascotry
raid, and had previously told Mr
Fuller that he should be in-
formed before a raid of this sort.
