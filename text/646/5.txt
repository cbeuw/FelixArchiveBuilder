Mascotry
Once upon a time, not so long
ago, considerable skill and
subtlety went into mascotry.
Once various mascoteers dressed
as waitresses to surprise a rival
CCU at a formal dinner; on
another occasion an RCS stu-
dent attended lectures in Mech
Eng for several weeks to gain the
trust of the Guildsmen.
Unfortunately, though, the
whole sport has degenerated into
a mindless obsession with
various RCS hacks who see the
theft of mascots as an end to
justify any means. One can only
hope that this latest incident,
which has quite rightly incurred
such criticism from both RCS

and IC Union, will not provoke
College into banning mascotry
altogether.
FELIX Motor Rally
As I wrote earlier this is an
annual event which this year
takes place on the morning of
Sunday June 19. Teams of four
competitors drive around some
surprisingly obscure parts of
London solving clues (what is
the title of the book Albert is
reading on the Albert Memorial?)
and collecting treasure (where
are you supposed to find an
empty toothpaste tube?).
Traditionally, the rally is set
by the Editor, the Puzzles Editor
and a third party who has a car
in London. Pinocchio and I have
already started thinking up
various devious places to send
you, but we are rather hampered
by the absence of a motor
vehicle. So if anyone with a car
would like to help set the rally
with us, I'd be very grateful if
they'd get in touch as soon as
possible at the FELIX Office.

TIME, I SUPPOSE, to devote a
few paragraphs in this column to
the great and glorious Stephen
Goulder. Fair-minded, hard-
working, keen to stay in touch
with the students he repre-
sents—what a superb President
he would make if only he
possessed these qualities. Not
that he is totally without merit,
of course; as I have said before,
his way with words and his sense
of humour are second to none in
the Union Office at the moment.
Unfortunately, many of the
Union staff feel that Mr Goulder
uses his humour to cover up his
failings by laughing off criticism.
They say his jovial pomposity
has become not a valid and
useful tool for brushing aside the
irritating trivia which inevitably
comkes his way, but as insensi-
tivity which permits him to
dismiss all fault-finding as
piffling discontent from ungrate-
ful minions. Rather like Victor
Mooney or Ronald Reagan he
sets himself up as a figure of
jollity and mirth and uses this as
a shield from his critics. Con-
sequently he rarely takes advice
from anybody and runs the
Union by doing exactly what he
pleases whethere he is supposed
to have authority or not.
This came to a head this week
when he 'found' a Gestetner
duplicating machine in the
Union Office. Lesser or more
humble men might have asked
about its origin, or its intended
destination. And they would
surely have asked Andy Grim-
shaw about it, since about the
only clearly defined part of the
Honorary Secretary's job is
B E L O W
looking after the Union's
duplicators.
Stephen, however, full of his
own importance and in mag-
nanimous mood, phoned up
Guilds Union and offered it to
them for nothing. Guilds, not
being slow to take advantage of
such an opportunity, had the
duplicator back to their office in
Mech Eng within the hour.
Enter Mr Andrew Grimshaw,
puzzled by the disappearance of
the new Gestetner he had
recently acquired to replace the
dilapidated machine he has been
making do with all year. A few
suitable enquiries, and an
embarrassed Union President
was heard making a grovelling
phone call to the officers of
C&G.
The story might have ended
there given f-ven a little tact and
common sense on the part of our
leauer. As it was, though, he
paid a visit to the Guilds Office
and, finding a Gestetner lying
idly by, took it back to Andy
Grimshaw in the Union without
making any enquires in Guilds
at all. Surprise, surprise, he soon
discovered he had brought back
the wrong machine, and had to
spend another few hours tracking
down the Guilds duplicating
officer to sort things out.
ICU Publications Board, and
FELIX in particular has also
had to suffer the force of
presidential pomp. Martin is still
puzzled by the time Stephen
repeatedly stressed the impor-
tance of attending a meeting of
the Union Finance Committee,

only to arrive and be publicly
warned that all the business
about to be conducted was
confidential and would he either
promise not to report it in
FELIX or leave the meeting.
Since Editor-elect Pallab Ghosh
was also reporting, Martin chose
to leave and found out what had
happened later.
But perhaps the first display
of the Goulderian use of langu-
age was at a meeting of the
Publications Board itself.
Stephen was explaining in
extraordinarily patronising
tones just how short of money
the Union is, and why we could
not be given as much as our
estimates demanded, and so
forth. This produced on his
listeners a soporific response of
glum acceptance, rather like a
form of prep-school boys hear-
ing their housemaster explain
why their pocket money is being
reduced. By the end of his
rhetoric Stephen's explanation
had slowly but distinctly ac-
quired the unmistakable aura of
a very formal and serious
speech, and it became obvious
that he was leading up to his big
conclusion.
T am sorry we are so short of
money' he said, loudly T am
sorry these cutbacks are neces-
sary but, as I am sure you're all
aware,' and here he dropped his
voice to a slow, deep, melo-
dramatic whisper, 'it is unavoid-
able under the economic con-
straints forced upon us all
today'.
There was a full five seconds
impressive silence, when sud-
denly the listeners realised what
a mountain of pretention had
been conveying such a molehill
of an idea, and the presidential
dignity was punctured by a
sudden outburst of prolonged
hysterical laughter.
And so to an aggrieved letter
from M Johnson, Met 3 and T
Stockings, Mat Tech 2, who tell
me that once upon a time they
were the winners of a raffle
organised by ICU, the prize
being a trip round Wadsworths
brewery. Mr Goulder told them
they would be notified of the
date of the visit in due course.
No notification was forthcoming
so they investigated, only to
discover the trip had already
taken place and they had missed
it.
'Is it not a sad reflection on
the President,' they ask 'that he
can't even organise a piss-up in a
brewery?'
LAST WEEK I wrote of Andy
Grimshaw advertising for a
woman to accompany him to a
coral atoll in the Indian Ocean.
But since then it has been
pointed out that the advertise-
ment was not for 'a woman' but
for 'another female member' to
join the expedition. Now just
supposing they had been a man
short: one can only wonder
whether Andy would have put a
quarter page ad in F E L I X
asking for another male member.
And talking of the expedition,
Union Administrator Jen Hardy-
Smith has been asking what
eight gramophone records Andy
will be taking to his island. Any
suggestions? I am offering a
small but prestigious prize for
the best appropriate record for
an Hon Sec such as Andy to take
to his desert island.
