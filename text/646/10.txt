The AGM was held last Friday.
As usual it was not well attended.
However, elections were held for
next year's officers. The results
of these elections (?) were that
John Scott was returned as
Captain, Chris Bean as Secretary
and Andv MacAleer as treasurer.
Among things discussed were
the teams performancs this year
which have been, as usual, very
good. All the mens leagues were
won by IC. The mixed third
division was also won by a very
'scratch' team. The UL Cup was
also won. Thus the season was
the most successful of recent
years. Thanks for this must go to
all "
t
h
e captains and especially
Peter Gadd. John Scott, Jane
Dominic, Ian, etc etc.
Apart from the teams the club
has been plagued by non-
availability of the Great Hall
and, as usual, less than adequate
facilities in the volleyball court.
This could be rectified if some-
one bought us a beautiful
sports centre with four courts
sauna, solarium, cocktail bar
Finally, many thanks to all the
regular players who have turned
up throughout the year. Also
remember that badminton is still
being played on Tuesday and
Friday evenings and the courts
are free on Saturday mornings
(see Chris if you would like to
use them). See you all next year.
Having achieved second place in
both the 10 and 25 miles British
Student Sports Federations time
trial championships team award,
the IC team came back on
Sunday to win the BSSF fifty
mile championships by more
than ten minutes from Cam-
bridge. Driving out of London
at 5:30am it was evident that a
good calm day weas awaiting on
the fast Oxford course. Williams
was second starter from the 25
strong student field but by the
thirty mile stage Gilday, starting
no 5 had overhauled all the
riders at minute intervals before
him. Next through was Williams
who had gone off course as
usual, followed shortly by Dave
Fairburn, Brunei University,
eventual winner and only stu-
dent to beat two hours (1-59-18).
Hotchkiss was offered food to
initially seemed to want it—but
proceeded to throw it all over
the road!
After a final twenty miles of
rolling busy dual carriageway
the final results were
1st Dave Fairburn Brunei 1-59-

6th John Gilday IC 2-06-44
8th Gary Hotchkiss IC 2-07-10

Please give them your sup-
port. Would anyone organising
Sunday runs please put details
on the noticeboard on the
walkway by Thursday mornings
if possible.

Just a couple of reminders
really: elections for next year's
Captains are on June 14 at
1:00pm above the Southside Bar.
Details at Sports Centre.
Jumpers, T-shirts (and sweat-
shirts when they arrive) are now
being sold in the Southside
Shop.
Despite the onset of quizzes
there are still plenty of people
prepared to play squash, and the
courts are still booked for
Squash Club. Soon there will be
no more time to climb to your
true position on the ladder and
have everyone recognise your
real talent. Well, that's my worry
anyway
REVIEWS!
Much noise,
Much cheerfulness
IC Symphony Orchestra
ICSO's summer concerts tend to suffer from
small audiences, due, no doubt, to the
conflicting claim of revision. Last Wedensday
was no exception—a pity as the orchestra gave
an excellent performance. Since Richard
Dickins has been conducting it, ICSO seems
to have improved with each concert: my only
serious criticism this time is at the choice of
programme.
Rimsky Korsakov himself described his
Capriccio Espagnol as 'undoubtedly a purely
external piece'. It's bright and frothy, using
Spanish dance themes. The orchestra
sounded rather hesitant in this first piece. The
cellos didn't achieve the intended Spanish
rhythms, but the solo flute was superb and the
first violins came across particularly
well—perhaps further 'guest appearances' by
music students and by David Bogle, leader of
ICSO until a couple of years ago, should be
encouraged!
The orchestra appeared more relaxed, and
accompanied Anna Meadows unselfconscious-
ly, in Mozart's Bassoon Concerto. The
bassoon makes nice, as well as funny, noises
but the instrument does not have sufficient
variety of tone to sustain interest through a
civilised, but essentially unexciting early
Mozart concerto.
. ICSO almost invariably plays best in the
second half of the concert—and Glazunov's
Symphony no 5 in B flat is an accessible and
immediately appealing work. There is much
noise, much cheerfulness, a teasing not-quite-
jingle-bells theme and a self-indulgent,
chocolate box of a third movement. The
orchestra produced a rather ragged start to
the scherzo, but otherwise gave an excellent
and most enjoyable performance. I'm only
P a g e l O H H M H H H H H H H H i
sorry they didn't apply their talents to
something more deeply rewarding. After being
treated to Mahler 1 last term, I had hoped for
greater things.
To finish on a sartorial note: what a happy
thought to have all the girls in black and white.
It can be most distracting to see deep magenta
sitting beside pale green and lemon, quite
apart from looking unprofessional.

Startling Contrasts
IC Choir
On Friday a rather small Imperial College
Choir plus 'Eric's orchestra' took the stage in
the Great Hall for their summer concert. They
performed three works: Spring fromThe
Seasons by Haydn, Gounod's Messe
Solennelle and Poulenc's Gloria.
The orchestra started well with the overture
to Spring, a work for soprano, tenor and bass
soloists and chorus. The choir, however, were
disappointing. Although their performance of
this piece was quite appropriate for Spring
1983, dull and uninspiring, I don't think it was
quite what Haydn had intended. Much of their
singing was breathy and lacked tone, Perhaps
the sound would improve if the choir spent less
time with their heads buried in their copies. It
wasn't until the last chorus of the work that the
choir produced their more typical confident
sound, and the sopranos even managed to hit
a few top notes which had eluded them in most
of the previous choruses. Both the tenor,
Christopher Gillett, and the bass-baritone
Richard Wigmore, sang well although neither
appeared at all inspired. At times Richard
Wigmore's strange facial expressions while
coping with the rather awkward German
vowels were more interesting than his singing.
The soprano, Lyn Parkyns, unfortunately
sounded very nervous and her tone was harsh.
Gounod's Messe Solennelle was a startling
M B M H M a y 27,1983 M B H
contrast. After a shaky start from the
orchestra the choir came in boldly on some
very exposed entries in the Kyrie. The greatly
outnumbered tenors sang well to help achieve
some well-balanced unaccompanied bars at
the end of the Kyn'e. Towards the end of the
Gloria the choir lost the good tone and the
singing became rather breathy, especially in
the soprano and alto lines. For a few bars all
that could be heard from the choir was some
loud hissing as they sang phrases such as
quoniam tu solus sanctus and tu solus
altissimus.
The Credo which followed was, for me, the
high spot of the concert. Strong brass parts, a
dotted rhythm in the lower strings and the
upper strings playing off the beat accompanied
a marvellous memorable melody sung with
conviction by the choir. There was, however,
a shaky ending as the men split into four
parts singing very close chords, the basses
suffering when divided. The Credo also saw
one of the rare occasions on which the altos
produced a clear confident entry, but
unfortunately the strings fell in one after the
other in a rather hazardous manner distracting
from the altos' acheivement. Christopher
Gillett gave his best performance of the
evening in the Sanctus, beautifully accom-
panied by the harp.
After the interval came Poulenc's Gloria, a
work for chorus and soprano solo. Lyn
Parkyns, the soloist, sounded more confident
tnan in the first half. The choir tackled the
challenging syncopated rhythm of the
Laudamus te very well, and even the sopranos
maintained a good tone throughout. Qui sedes
gave the altos an opportunity to prove that
confident entries are not so rare after all. They
and the tenors came in boldly but, unfor-
tunately, not quite in the same key. This
problem was resolved after a few seconds and
the choir completed the concert confidently.
