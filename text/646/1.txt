SCHMIDT QUITS
Karl Schmidt, President of the Royal College of Science Union, has
resigned following an incident in which an RCSU mascotry team using
an ICU van was stopped by police.
The van had been hired from
the Union by RCSU Hon Sec
C h a s F u l l e r w h o t o l d the
receptionist that it was not to be
used for mascotry, but just to get
some beer. However, it wa,s
driven bv Simon Moore, I C U
Transport Officer and RCSU
hack to the Guilds U G M which
was taking place by the Albert
Memorial in Hyde Park. There,
the RCS mascotry team noticed
that the Guilds van was accom-
panied by a Mini which they
suspected was used for trans-
porting the Guilds mascots.
They started to disable it by
removing some parts from the
engine but were seen by a Hyde
Park policeman who, thinking
that they were car thieves, called
his Hyde Park headquarters. As
the team followed the Guilds
van out of the Queen's Gate, the
diplomatic police outside the
Iraqui Embassy attempted to
stop it, but were not seen by M r
Moore, who continued to follow
the Guilds van. The latter took a
U-turn back to the Park, in an
attempt to lose its followers. By
then, all the police in the area
had been warned and, had the
R C S U van not been stopped'
by a police car inside the park,

Even Stephen!
After a fierce argument with
Honorary Secretary Andy Grim-
shaw last Monday, Stephen
Goulder was seen in the Union
Bar drinking heavily, waving a
stool and shouting 'Kill Grim-
wash' at regular intervals.
He then started an argument
No. 646ms^mmmmm
with Sean Davis, next year's
Hon Sec. This developed into
what he later described as a
'friendly tussle' and Nick Pyne,
the U G M Chairman and ex-
Welfare Officer, intervened—
only to be banned from the
Union Bar by an intemperate
and irate President.
Mr Goulder later apologised
to all concerned.

LOUTS OUT
Six students from Tizard Hall
have been fined £25 each after
ransacking the Assistant Sub-
warden's room late on Tuesday.
In addition three have been told to
leave the Hall immediately after
their exams.
The students have until today
to accept the fines or face the
College Disciplinary Committee
which has not met for over three
years.
The three students told to
leave, Nick Barnes, Dave Hop-
per and Richard Simpson, are
unhappy with the decision
because they will not be refunded
rent they have already paid (£50
for two of them) and also
because they feel they have been
singled out. However the Hall
Warden told them to leave
because he fears they will disturb
other residents who are still
revising for their exams.
The other named students are
Mat Moran, Duncan Wright and
Peter Webb but they claim at
least fifteen students were
involved.
The incident occurred on the
night of the Tizard Hall coming
down dinner and was a result of
bad feeling which built up
between the students (five of
whom are re-aps) and Steve
Johnson, the Assistant Sub-
Warden, during the year. The ran-
sacking left the room uninhabi-
table for the night after the bed
had been soaked and covered in
shaving foam. The students
claim they entered through the
window although it has been
suggested they must have used a
pass-key. They have been
interviewed by Geoffrey Reeves,
College Security Officer, about
this.
They're at it again! This front page from last year's FELIX shows that
no news is new news!
