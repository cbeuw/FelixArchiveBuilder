A Grim
Washout?
Dear Martin
I was somewhat surprised to
read the news story 'GFimwash
Snubbed' in last week's FELIX.
The implication of the facts is
clear: that if the Executive con-
sider Andy Grimshaw insuffici-
ently competant to take on the
job of President for a short time.
This suggests the Executive also
consider him incapable of
fulfilling his job as Honorary
Secretary (a glance at his job
description will verify this).
Why, then, have the Executive
not seen fit to bring a motion of
no confidence to the next UGM?
I would like to suggest two
possibilities—either Andy is not
as incompetent as might have
been suggested, or that the
Executive have realised that the
blame for Andy's incompetence
lies squarely upon their own
shoulders.
Others may disagree, but I
would suggest that the prospec-
tive demise of two Honorary
Secretaries in a year (both of
whom had little experience but a
desire to be helpful and do the
job well) says more about those
with whom they have had to
work than about the individuals
themselves.
Furthermore, I can only see
matters getting worse next year
as one of the principal back-
biters (Christine 'I never liked
her from the start' Teller) has
been elected to the Exec!
I look forward to the contro-
versy at the A G M (June 7,
ME220, 1pm) and remind the
Exec that the deadline for
motions of no confidence to
appear in Exec News as Monday,
l ' / 2 weeks before the meeting.
Yours

Dear Martin
Regarding Robert Kelsey's
article in last week's FELIX, I
should like to raise the following
points:
1. The Russian attitude to
unilateral disarmament and
weakness leaves much to be
desired—while the US cut her
armed forces from 3m to 2m,
Russia increased hers to over
3m; when Britain withdrew from
the Indian Ocean, Russia moved
in; and. remember Afghanistan!
2. The independent deterrent
of Britain (and France) is
necessary to provide powerful
discouragement to any Russian
administration if it were to
contemplate the exploitation of
any future period of American
feebleness.
3. Neutralism rarely deters an
aggressor—remember Belgium
in the last war.
4. A reduction in the number
of nuclear weapons by the West
would necessitate an increase in
the levels of conventional forces
required to maintain our defen-
sive credibility, the increased
costs of which would exceed any
savings from the reduction in the
nuclear arsenal.
5. Our defence needs do not
preclude an intensified pro-
gramme of technical and eco-
nomic aid to the Third World—
thirty years ago we spent 1 Wc of
our national wealth on defence,
now we spend about 59c and we
are much richer.

Dear Martin
I'm sorry I'm stealing some
space off your otherwise enter-
taining 'Letters' page, but I feel
that since some people use it to
.argue just for argument's sake, I
should be entitled to do so too.
In his letter (FELIX 645), Mr
J Smith answers 'some of the
mistaken and misguided state-
ments' Robert Kelsey put
forward in his disarmament
article two weeks ago. Yet, he
does not correct such statements
with facts, but just with his own
ideas, which are no more likely
to be right than Mr Kelsey's. For
example. Mr Kelsey probably
does not know about double,
treble and ennuple checks
required to launch a missile, but
how much more does Mr Smith
know? Has he read about them
in a sci-fi novel? Or in a NATO
pamphlet'1
Can he tell the
difference between the two?
As for the next argument, it is
my personal opinion that, even
by arming itself, Britain will still
be a 'weakling' with respect to
the two 'big guys'. In any case,
using a bit of logic, it is not hard
to see why arming to achieve
disarmament is contradictory: if
both sides think that acquiring
new weapons will cause the
opponent to disarrp, then they
both will do so. causing arma-
ment rather than disarmament.
And so on. I do not intend to
go on arguing on this page, as
my letter would become longer
and more boring than Mr
Smith's. If he wants to hear my
personal views on the rest of his
letter, he may drop in for a cup
of coffee.

Dear Martin
Response to Robert Kelsey's
article on unilateral disarma-
ment, as expressed in your letters
page last week, has left me
greatly dismayed. I would be
grateful for the space in your
columns with which to reply to
some of the criticism.
I was particularly disap-
pointed with Mr Jonathan
Smith's singularly cynical attack
on Rob's arguments and would
like to offer him some thoughts
of my own. In his letter he
provides enlightenment on the
logic Of the 'position of strength'
argument (ie that we should arm
to disarm) by reducing the
international nuclear arms race
to a school-yard scenario. Such a
euphemistic analogy not only
anaesthetises the issues at stake
but is also manifestly incorrect.
He argues that it is more
advantageous to play the bully
in the nuclear weapons game
because one is then in a position
to force concessions from one's
'weakling' opponent. However,
what he fails to realise is that, in
militaristic terms. Russia is by no
means a weakling and when
threatened by improved Ameri-
can weaponry the Kremlin's
only obvious course is to
modernise her own forces. This
is precisely what has happened
in the past forty years—surely by
now it is abundantly clear that
any attempt to negotiate from a
position of strength is inherently
self-defeating.
Mr Smith then goes on to
state, in defence of the 'concept
of deterrence', that whilst it is
OK for the NATO and Warsaw
Pact countries, with their greater
'political stability', to threaten
each other with mass murder as
a means of maintaining peace
(and harmony?), there are
certain 'tin-pot dictatorships and
revolutionary juntas' who would
not be 'suitable custodians of
such immense power'. Having
neatly divided the nations of the
world into these three distinct
categories we are left to admire
our political maturity. Once
again his viewpoint is lacking in
both depth and humanity.
I would just like to comment
that according to a United
Nations report of last year the
massive expenditure on nuclear
arms is placing an intolerable
strain on the global economy
and rapidly paving the way for
world instability which, in the
opinon of the UN, is a one-way
ticket to war.

Dere mister Editor
Every weak, me and my frend
read your newspaper and my
frend sa that he thinks he nos
wot to do abowt newclear
wepons.
He sa that if the best way to
stop war and bieng blown up is
to have lots of boms, then we
need more. Also, if everyone had
there own bom, it would be
good, cos there wud be no mor
wars. If i had a bom i wud put it
under Fotherington-Thomas
(cos he is a weed and a wet) i bet
that wud suprise him. If we all
have a bom then rusya wud hav
to talk to all of us and that way
nothing wil hapen. i think that
mister Androboff and mister
Raygun shud be made to fite and
deside who is grater lik we do at
skule. It realy is simple wen yo
think about it dont you think? i
cant understan al the long words
wot pepol have riten, but they
are al making it complicated and
my frend sa they give him a
hedake.
