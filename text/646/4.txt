Dear Martin
I was surprised by Mr Mar-
tin's letter about the SCC Mock
General Election. He questions
the democracy of the ballot as
candidates had to be sponsored
by one of the five (not three Mr
Martin) political societies. I
understand democracy as being
accepting the will of the major-
ity. Mr Martin knows, since I am
glad to say he was present at the
meeting, that a majority of the
Clubs present voted for this
criteria to be applied to candi-
dates. As I made quite clear at
the meeting I think this was a
wrong decision but I aceept the
will of the majority—that is
what real democracy is all about.
Mr Martin asks people to
abstain on Thursday June 2 but
I hope people will vote. There
will be ballot boxes in Mech
Eng, Mines, Sherfield, Huxley,
the JCR and Union Building
from 12:30pm to 2:30pm. You
will need Unioncards to vote.
The candidates at each of these
six constituencies will be La-
bour, Conservative and Alli-
ance. There will be two con-
current ballots: one based on
STV and the other on a 'first
past the post' system I hope
people share my view that this
kind of election will be an
•amusing distraction in a boring
exam term. It will not change the
results on June 9, it will not
prove anyting, the results may
not be a great surprise. I merely
hope that it will be fun. Don't
abstain, VOTE on June 2.
Yours democratically

Mocking Miller
Dear Martin
I would like to make one or
two points on the subject of
Jonathan Miller's mock 'elec-
tion' to be held on June 2.
Having announced his decision
to hold such an event at the last
UGM, he was then able to push
the idea through the full Social
Clubs Committee meeting (held
after the UGM) on the basis that
it had already been agreed and
despite the opposition of all the
political societies. The com-
promise to allow only candidates
nominated by political societies
was agreed because it was
generally recognised that the
idea would be unworkable
otherwise. (If this had only had
the support of the political
societies as Neil Martin alleges in
his letter last week then it would
not have been passed since they
are a minority on SCC.)
However, for a number of
reasons which I will deal with
later the political societies
remained unenthusiastic. So
much so that only ConSoc was
in fact prepared to nominate
candidates, and then only
reluctantly. In the absence of a
proper field of candidates Mr
Miller, being anxious not to lose
face (especially in the light of his
recently increased status as
acting-President) decided that
instead he would hold a ballot
with only the names of the two
main parties and the Alliance on
the ballot papers. The results of
this exercise in unscientific
opinion polling will of course be
completely meaningless. Despite
this Mr Miller is still proposing
to spend £200 of Union money
on the 'election'. It's just as well
he's only going to be President
for five days if this is the kind of
hare-brained scheme he comes
up with.
In case anyone is thinking that
the blame for making this mock
'election' into a farce rests with
the political clubs, consider these
points. First, relatively few
people are going to even be in
College to vote at the time of the
election and those that are will
mainly be doing exams; and if
active members of political clubs
do have any spare time during
exams they will no doubt be
involved in canvassing for their
respective parties in the real
election in marginal constitu-
encies (ie not around College).
More seriously, any publicity
produced or distributed locally
during the general election
campaign, even for a mock
election, would almost certainly
break the electoral law unless
authorised by the local candi-
dates' agent (which it seems
unlikely it would be). The
turnout for such a mock 'elec-
tion' would be extremely low for
these reasons, and so would have
no chance of producing a
reliably representative result.
Despite these facts, which I
presented at the U G M , Mr
Miller (ably assisted by John
Passmore) managed to secure
acceptance of his proposals, not
by refuting my arguments (I
think his argument was 'it'll be a
bit of fun') but by making it
appear that I was merely afraid
that the party which I support
would not win. I think subse-
quent events have shown that
Mr Miller's idea of a mock
election, although well meaning,
is ill-conceived and at totally the
wrong time. I hope that he does
the sensible thing and calls the
whole thing off before he wastes
any more time and money (or is
made to look even sillier than he
already does).
Yours etc

Hate Campaign
Does IC hate residents at Evelyn
Gardens?
During the past two years I
have slowly come to believe IC
hates Evelyn Gardens. I have
heard rumours that Mining
House has the worst record of all
student residences for the quality
of degrees obtained. Now at last
I have realised this is not due to
the excellent social life at Mining
House, but a planned campaign
by IC.
Before the exams last year it
was repairs to frost damage at
the front of the street. This year I
have moved to the rear of the
house and the work has moved
with me in the form of scaffold-
ing and fiddling with drains.
Both of these operations are very
noisy and as a result detrimental
to serious study.
The clever part of the IC
strategy is the way they have
managed to find repairs and
plan it to coincide with the
weeks preceding the exam
period, instead of using the
many months throughout the
summer when exams are not on
the minds of IC students! It will
be interesting to see how long IC
can keep up the pressure on
Evelyn Gardens by finding new
repairs to carry out before the
exams each year.

ache and not paranoia)

Best in the Country
Sir
Your front page on the UGM
of May 12 was an interesting and
surprising example of selective
reporting.
Your correspondent, strange-
ly, seems to have completely
missed the point of my opposi-
tion to the procedural motion
which had been backed by the
threat of a call for quorum from
its proposers if we dared to
oppose it. What I said, quite
clearly, was that those of us who
condemn these attempts to
steamroller through left-wing
motions had absolutely no wish
to see the normal business of the
Union disrupted. We were there
to stand up against the subver-
sive motion, and not to stop the
meeting getting on with its
important work.
It was quite clear from the
response to my comments that
the procedural motion was
about to be heavily defeated if it
was allowed to go to a vote; so
that the Union would be able to
proceed with the election of
officers. There is not doubt in
my mind that quorum was called
in order to prevent the U G M
from throwing out that sinister
motion with its crude blackmail
threat.
At the same time, those who
put up these highly politically
motivated motions at UGMs
should realise that the executive
of RSMU was elected to repre-
sent the interests of all members
of RSMU and has every inten-
tion of continuing to do so. As
you quite rightly said in your
editorial, the concept of quoracy
is one of the Union's funda-
mental protections against being
railroaded by a fanatical minor-
ity. It would be quite wrong for
ICU to be bound by extreme
political motions quietly passed
by an unrepresentative handful
of ambitious socialists to the
great detriment of the interests
of the majority.
F E L I X is easily the best
newspaper of its kind in the
country. We all hope that you
will continue to maintain the
standards of impartial journal-
ism that are the foundations of
its success.

God or Mammon?
Dear Editor
I have had some enquiries
about an organisation calling
itself 'The School of Economic
Science' which has its head-
quarters in Queensgate. It is
quite secretive about its activi-
ties, but appears to have some
aspects of a religious cult. If
anyone has been approached by
representatives of this organisa-
tion, or can give me any inform-
ation about it, I would be glad if
you could give me a ring on
Internal 4221, or send a note to
the Chaplains Office, 10 Princes
Gardens.
Thanks
