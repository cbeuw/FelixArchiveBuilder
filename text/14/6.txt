In a college the size of I.C. i t i s natural
that we have amongst our numbers, many outstanding
personalities i n the realm of sport. I t i s grat-
i f y i n g t o find that t h i s talent i s recognised by
the university selectors, and that as a result I.C.
i s , i n general, well represented i n the- university
tearrs.
We f e e l therefore, that our readers may be
interested to hear o l I.C.'s coi.tribution to uni-
versity sport and have Included i n t h i s issue b r i -
ef accounts from two university cluos.
The demand of the university for our best pla-
yers naturally weakens the college tear.s, ,nd match
secretaries cannot therefore obtain such good f i x -
tures as would otherwise be possible. This raises
a most controversial point i n the f i e l d of college
sport, the pros and cons of which nave been debated
over many a pint of beer i n the bar - to which club
aoes the loyalty of the {layers belong, college or
university. Many players have three clubs simul-
taneously demanding tneir services and the decision
is a hard one to make.
A preliminary l i s t of university purples awar-
ded for the. 1949-1950 season was lublished i n the
Review issue of lhoenix. Ihose given below have
been awarded since that publication.

SQUASH RACKETS
The I.C. Squash Rackets Club has s t a r t e d the
season i n a very s a t i s f a c t o r y manner. Four 1st
team matches have been won, i n c l u d i n g those against
Ashtead and Lensbury, who are among our strongest
opponents. Wimbledon proved just too strong f o r
us: t h i s nev; f i x t u r e was however a great success,
and we hope t o turn the tables i n January. A weak-
ened team without J e f f . Kenyon were narrowly defeat-
ed by Kings College.
Kenyon, '.'.'right and Squire are consistent per-
formers. Martin arid Swain a* numbers 3 and 5 have
been e r r a t i c , but should improve with more match
play and experience.
The second team has won twice and l o s t twice.

SOCCER
Imperial College 1, Westminster 6
I.C. made a somewhat h u r r i e d e x i t from the U.L.
Cup competition when they were beaten by Westminster
at Harlington on Sturday November 11th.
The f i r s t h a l f of the game was f a i r l y even but
I.C. could only score once against Westminster's 3-
Briscoe 3 c o r e d the I C. goal a f t e r the opposition
had b u i l t up a three goal lead, the f i r s t of which
was put past Williams by an unfortunate I.C. defen-
der.
In the second period I.C, with Ward limping on
the right-wing, were always'fighting a l o s i n g b a t t l e
and, t r y as they might, could not stop Westminster
adding three more t o t h e i r t o t a l .
On t h i s form Westminster, a s s i s t e d by Wade,last
year's U.L. captain, should win the Cup; we wish them
luck.
The I.C. team was:- Williams ( c a p t . ) ; C o l l i n s o n ,
Ward; Eastland, Perkins, Last; J e w i t t , 'Wheeler, Thom-
pson^.E.), Briscoe, Bowtell.
In D i v i s i o n I I of the U.L. League I.C. 2nd XI
have dropped 3 points out of 4 t o L.S.E. and some-
how contrived to lose t o West Ham T.C. Four v i c -
t o r i e s give the 2nd XI 9 points from 7 games.
The 3rd XI l o s t t h e i r f i r s t 4 D i v i s i o n I I I
games but won the next two scoring 23 goals i n the
process.
On Saturday, Dec. 9th, I.C. defend the U.L.six-
a-side championship a t Motspur Park. With plenty
of vocal support I.C. might win t h i s tournament f o r
the t h i r d year i n succession.

U.L. RUGGER
After twp disapj ointJnt 'voluntary' t r i a l s the
f i n a l ' i n v i t a t i o n only' t r i a l provided scire e x c e l l -
ent Rugby and a p o t e n t i a l l y strong team was select-
ed. A f t e r fighting an unbeaten Brighton to a draw
in the f i r s t match the team settled down well and
three successive wins, including a 5-3 (1 e. to
1 p.p.) win over St. Vary's Hospital led to the ea-
r l y building up o f an excellent team s p i r i t .
The l o s s of the centre triangle from the scium
and the i n a b i l i t y of finding a suitable half-back
combination has considerably weakened the team and
three of the l i s t four games nave been l o s t . One
noteworthy point about these l o s t games i s the fact
that even under pressure the University team have
continued to play good attacking Bug by and the score
has been i n c i d e n t a l to the s p i r i t of the tame.
Of the team, I.C. have regularly provided five
players - P. Evans (capt.), R. Severn Chon. s e c ) ,
D. Crossley, B. Pobins, ''. Robinson. Ihe o f f i c e r s
of the U.L.R.F.C. are very grateful to the 1.0. Club
for t h e i r excellent co-operation i n providing, a l l
too frequently, l a s t minute reserves - reserves who
have played with d i s t i n c t i o n i r the University c o l -
ours .

U.L. SOCCER
In the years since the War, the U.L. Soccer
Club has been integrated into a major iorce i n U.L.
A.U., and has t h i s season i t s strongest f i x t u r e l i s t
for many years, including matches against Oxford,
Cambridge and Paris U n i v e r s i t i e s , and many rejres-
entative sides of hign standing. As well as f i e l d -
ing a strong team, the University Eoccer Club runs
a League of three Divisions, embracing 86- teams
from a l l but three of the Colleges run.dug Soccer
sides. An annual Six-a-Side Tournanent i s held
(this year on December 9th.), and also the Uniyer-
sity Association Football Cup competition.
With a l l t h i s happening i n t i l s present season,
i t seems a f a r cry from two se-so.-s ago, when no less
than 7 of the University team cane froir I.e., to t o -
day, when I.C.'s sole lir.ii i s a non-playing Secretary
and when I.C. have just l o s t interest i n the Cup for
t h i s season. However, the I.C. Soccer Club s t i l l
supiort the U.L. Club as f a r as they are able and look
forward t o the day when I.C. i s again i r a position
to supjly University players. I t w i l l long be r e -
membered i n University c i r c l e s that i t was largely
due to I.C. players i n the post-war years that the
University Club i s what i t i s today.
To date, the University team has played s i x ga-
mes and been beaten only once, l a s t Saturday at Cam-
bridge, by the U n i v e r s i t y , the only goal of the match
being the deciding goal. Put n.ost Important of a l l
the team beat a f u l l County side recently when they
defeated Sussex .3-0 at Fastbourne. 5he County d i d
the hontur of f i e l d i n g the strongest team they could
yuster, but i t was not strong enough, which augurs
well f o r the future.
