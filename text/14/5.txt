P R O F I L E - PIONEER EDITOR
As i s amply told on another page i t is just
twelve months since FELIX was born - twelve mo-
nths in which our college has been very much i n the
public eye: spectacularly in the West London Police
Court and on the Serpentine, quietly and more signi-
ficantly in the Parliamentary debates on the concept
of a Technical University.
In this last year of the perpetual struggle to
prevent the college from degenerating into a forcing
nous* of technical knowledge, individuals rather than
organisations have both led the way and carried most
of the burdens, amongst whom E. M. Hughes, f i r s t ed-
itor of FELIX i s a notable example.
It was because he felt so strongly that much of
the apathy at I.C. was due to ignorance of what went
on that Ted consented to become a veterinary obstre-
tician, wet-nurse and guiding hand when FELIX was
f i r s t conceived.
Ted Hughes was boen i n Croydon i n 1923, the son
of an eminent dental surgeon. When he left school
at Saffron Waldron (Higher School Certificate with
one mark to spare), he put i n a year i n an engineer-
ing shop. He then went to Northampton Engineering
College when he failed Part I (this time by an un-
specified margin).
After his training i n Canada he was commisioned
in the E.A.F. as a pilot, sunbathed his way through
0. T.U. in the Bahamas and then flew Liberators based
on Ceylon and the Cocos Islands.
The Utopian society of these islands i n which
the worst disease i s asthma and the only 'crime' the
anticipation of marriage, made a lasting impression
on him and did much to restore a faltering faith i n
humanity. It i s interesting to note that while en-
joying London l i f e more than most, he feels that only
such a communal appraach as the setting up of a res-
idential university of South Kensington, with at lea-
st two liberal arts faculties brought i n , can prov-
ide that intellectual clash between different types
of mind, so essential to university society.
His college l i f e is very much i n keeping with
his reserved, polished, competent and somewhat per-
suasive manner. For the f i r s t two years he worked
"because I felt I ought to". In his third year he
calmly picked up the heaviest, and trickiest job -
the editorship of FELIX - carried i t overwhelmingly
to success and collected a f i r s t in Mechanical En-
gineering on the way. Without, we dare aver, dis-
turbing one lock of the perfectly parted hair or ne-
glecting once to polish his glistening shoes.
With his proteg4 well established Ted has r e l -
uctantly become Editor-elect of PHOENIX but despite
this association with fine jeathers and ancient l i n -
eage he is s t i l l Advisory Editor of the nosier and
we hope more agile FELIX.
Ted is now engaged on research i n gas dynamics.
He i s Secretary of the Links club, plays squash for
1. C., and has already shown himself an administrator
of standing and a man with the good of the college
very much in his mind. For the future we may be
sure that Ted Hughes will continue to edit and en-
gineer with equal f a c i l i t y .

GARDEN NOTES
by Umfaam.
Attention in the garden, at this time of the
year of wet muggy nights, should be directed to-
wards those flowers which overcrowd and wither in
the shelter of every wall. The less pleasing
flowers, should be immediately uprooted and cast
out, for they muscle out the sweet and beautiful
varities, a l l of which require constant care and
encouragement.
In arid places progress is much accelerated
by the early and frequent applications of a sol-
ution G-innan Lime, which should be allowed to soak
right in. At this stage i t is often expedient to
transplant the flowers to less crowded jarts of the
garden, where there is plenty of shade
If the above precautions are observed, while
keeping the plants warm at nights, and well pro-
tected from ohills, these flora should be at the
height of fragrant loveliness for Christmas.
Although large scale experiments carried out
in America on the upturning of Clods and subsequent
spraying with D.D.T. were most effective, the more
efficient method is the removal of each weed, indiv
ideally, by hand; even i f this may be more back-
breaking.
I commend to you a l l a supreme effort to set
our hop-garden in order before i t becomes too in-
fested. — .
