What the RCS lacked on the river they made up for
on the bank. They certainly had the most colourful
procession to Putney this year. At 1.30 a ceremon-
ial march scoured the various college departments
for brownbaggers. Then, with a rendering of the
new RCS war-cry 'Kangella' in the RCS Hall, the
procession, headed by the Drum, the 'band' and
some banners ("Equal Rights for Men',etc) moved off
to South Ken., scoring off a motor-cyclist on i t ' s
way and rendering 'Lloyd George knew my father' to
a bewildered public. Pennies on the Drum supplied
funds for a party ticket for 90 (there were 120 of
them).
At Putney Bridge the leaders were dismayed to
see the ticket collector counting the number so
'Every man for himself was the order. Astride Put-
ney bridge, the President, balancing precariously
on the parapet oalled for 'Kangella', Finally the
RCS task force marohed into the battle-area outside
Imperial College boathouse. What followed is reps
orted elsewhere.
( On the way back, Guildsmen propelled a win-
dow-clearing barrow into the ranks of the returning
scientists. The latter regarded i t as a fair prize,
and i t certainly arrived back in South Kensington,
but i t ' s subsequent fate is unknown.

A GRIZZLY SKY WATCHED THE ROYAL SCHOOL
OF MINES WIN THE 1950 RACE FOR THE
MORPHY CUP ON WEDNESDAY NOV. 22nd.
THIS WAS AFTER THE RACE HAD BEEN STOP-
PED HALF WAY DUE TO A COLLISION BETW-
EEN GUILDS AND R.C.S. RESULTING IN A
BROKEN OAR. W
H
E
N THIS HAPPENED THE
MINES WERE LEADING BY ABOUT 1 LENGTH
FROM GUILDS WHO LED RCS BY A CANVAS.
THE OAR REPLACED, THE 'RACE' WAS RE-
STARTED IN THESE POSITIONS AND THE
FINAL PLACING SAW MINES THE UNDOUBT-
ED VICTORS BY If LENGTHS, WITH GUILDS
SECOND ABOUT J LENGTH UP ON RCS.
THE LOWRY CUP WAS WON BY GUILDS,
WITH RCS AND MINES DEAD-HEATED.
By our Rowing Correspondent.
The Morphy Cup of 1950 will be remembered for
two things. Firstly, for an extremely good Mines
crew who always looked thoroughly comfortable and
rowed i n a very businesslike manner. Secondly, for
bad coxing on the part of the Guilds cox, which not
only impeded his own boat but the RCS as well.
There was a fast ebbing tide and a cross following
wind when the three crews turned to drift down to
the start. A l l three crews made good starts, st-
riking blade for blade, at 37. Guilds took the
lead at once being a canvas up on the RCS and near-
ly half a length on the Mines at the end of half a
minute. The Mines by now were getting well into
their stride and at Harrods the three crews were
level. It was at this point that erratic steering
on the part of the Guilds kept themselves and the
RCS much too close to the Surrey shore. The Mines
taking f u l l advantage of this were steered into the
fastest part of the tide and rowing very comfortably
at 33 proceeded to draw ahead. At the Crab Tree
the Mines were half a length up and by the Mile Post
had increased this to a length. Soon after the Mile
Post as they were approaching the bend the RCS clas-
hed with Guilds, a thing they might well ha-/e done
much earlier. The crews were brought back and re-
started just below the Mile Post iri their relative
positions at the time of the clash. In the row in,
though i t looked possible at one time that the RCS
might just beat the Guilds for second place, the
lead of the Mines remained unchallenged, and they
won by 1% lengths from the Guilds, with the RCS a
further # length behind. A word of praise must be
given to the Guilds crew for the very fine fighting
spirit they showed. The Mines time of 3 min 15 sees
for the Mile Post showed that they would have done a
fast time i f the race had not been interrupted.
The Lowry Cup was won by the Guilds in the fast
time of 4 min 20 sees. This result was not unexpec-.
ted, but due to spirited competition from the other
two crews they were unable to establish a lead t i l l
the end of the wall. They were obviously the more
polished crew as their 2)C lengths victory showed.
There was a fine fight which deservedly ended in a
dead-heat between the Mines and the RCS for second
place. If the same fighting spirit i s to charac-
terise the IC crews this year, then we can hope for
great things.
