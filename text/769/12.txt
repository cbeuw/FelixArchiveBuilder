News FELIX, Friday May 1st 1987 1 2
No BT,
no comment
An intense environmental conflict is
set to explode in Prince Consort
Road.
Last week British Telecom decided
to replace the old red telephone box
between the. RSM building and the
RCM. with a brand, spanking new
one of the smoked glass and
aluminium variety.
However. City of Westminster
Council, have moved quickly
deeming it to be of "architectural or
historical interest", and thus
protecting it with a building
preservation order.
The Council told FELIX that the
telephone box now has at least six
months grace whilst it is considered
by the Department of the
Environment for inclusion as a listed
building.
The Council spokeswoman said that
she didn't like the new boxes and that
it was council policy to preserve the
old style boxes wherever they are in
keeping with the character of their
surroundings.
BT were unavailable for comment
and it is unclear whether or not it will
affect the price of their shares.
New man for IC
ICU will be taking on a fourth
member of Union Office permanent
staff. College administration have
approved the post of a Union
accountant. who will have
responsibility for looking after all the
Union books and preparing the
accounts for the auditors. The Union
Office is to be extended into the
Upper Lounge to provide extra office
space. The new job description will
be finalised shortly, and it is hoped
that an appointment will be made at
the end of June. College Secretary
John Smith is keen to see the Union
Office permanent staff expand to five
at the end of next year, when the area
of greatest need has been identified.
Mark will be back next week
Money for
Union gym
The Union Gym, on the second floor
of the Union Building, is to undergo
major refurbishment over the
summer. The money will be available
because of a re-arrangement in the
way that maintenance of the Union
Building is funded.
Previously the Union has been
given money for furniture and
equipment, but major maintenance
and redecoration has been the
responsibility of the College. John
Smith, the College Secretary, is
proposing that the Union be given an
increased amount, about £25,000, to
pay for all decoration in the Union
Building, apart from major structural
and electrical work.
As part of the changeover, the
College may pay for the
refurbishment of the Gym, including
sanding the floor and modernising the
changing rooms, at a cost of about
£7,000—although a similar
refurbishment of the Union Dining
Hall and kitchens on the first floor
will be paid for from the Union fund.
There is a possibility that wire will
be placed over the windows in the
Gym, thus allowing the playing of
ball games, and the floor being
marked for fencing and badminton,
instead of fencing and basketball as
it is at the moment.
Long term plans on the completion
of the proposed sports centre include
fitting a permanent mat to the floor
and making the Union Gym suitable
for more specialist uses.
Museum
staff strike
Museum clerical staff are to go on
strike on Thursday 7th and Friday 8th
May in a demand for higher pay.
Since 1980 when the Government
terminated an agreement linking
salaries of civil servants with those in
the private sector, their pay has
decreased by 20% in real terms. To
remedy this the CPSA (Civil and
Public Service Association) wants the
average pay of its members increased
by £20 from the present average of
£88 a week. The Treasury is only
prepared to provide a 4.25% increase
(£5.75 for most people). Over half the
140,000 membership of the CPSA
voted by a margin of 2 to 1 to strike,
so from the start of next week staff
in Government departments such as
Health and Social Security and
Custom and Excise will take action.
Administrative and secretarial staff
from the Geological, Science and
Victoria and Albert museums join
them on Thursday and Friday. Branch
secretary Philip Shaw said that the
strike would not cause serious
disruption to the running of the
museum but would inconvenience the
management. He pointed out that
CPSA members were not noted for
being militant so that the vote to strike
was an indication of how bad the
situation is. Christine Taig, IC Union
200 in new
houses
College will be acquiring 200 new
places in house-type accommodation
for next year. Subject to confirmation
of planning details and financial
support, Michael Arthur, College
Assistant Secretary, hopes to sign
contracts this week. Although the new
places will not be available until
October, it is hoped they will allow
all first years to be offered places in
residence.
It is expected that rents will have
to rise more than usual for all College
accommodation to cover the financing
of the project.
Meanwhile, College are planning to
install an additional warden in
Southside. This will mean the loss of
one of the penthouse flats which
would otherwise be available for
student use. The Union Executive are
unhappy that this decision has been
taken by the administration without
any consultation or explanation. They
believe there will always be a
desperate need for such
accommodation.
