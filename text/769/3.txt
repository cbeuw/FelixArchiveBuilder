Parliamentary hang-ups
Mr Austin Mitchell, the Labour MP
for Great Grimsby, addressed a
Socialist Society meeting in Huxley
139 last Tuesday. In an eighty minute
talk including a question and answer
session, he devoted much of his time
to talking about the economy. He said
that in 1979 the country had had an
historic opportunity, in the form of
North Sea oil, to expand its economy
without incurring a balance of
payments crisis. Mrs Thatcher's
govrnment, he said, had wasted that
opportunity by destroying an
unprecedented number of jobs and
using the oil money to pay for the
state debt. He stressed that growth
was the key to a healthy economy and
that it should be achieved, if
necessary, by deficit budgeting and
letting one's currency drop.
When asked about Labour's
defence policy, Mr Mitchell said that
he thought British nuclear weapons
unnecessary, but he would prefer to
get rid of them by negotiation rather
than unilaterally.
On the election, he said that he did
not think there would be a hung
parliament, but if there were, and
Labour were the largest party, it
Labour ready to accept power
would try to govern anyway without
compromising its policies. When
questioned about proportional
representation, he said that he was
part of a growing minority in the
Labour Party in favour of it, though
it was not official Labour Party
policy.
Princes
amongst
Kings
In the one hundred and fiftieth
anniversary of the University of
London debating competition, a
beleagured IC DebSoc team
triumphed over huge opposition,
including the London School of
Economics, and no less than five
teams from Kings.
In the first round of rapid debates,
the IC team carried the majority on
the motion that 'This house believes
that history is bunk', and successfully
opposed the statement that 'This
house believes that a man's place is
in the home', scoring around 60
points out of a maximum seventy on
both.
The semi-final saw them set against
the LSE in the motion that 'This house
would start again', a performance
which took them to the final, against
one of the many teams from Kings,
which was chaired by KQC principal
Stewart Sutherland, and judged by
Lord Flowers and Lord Elwin Jones.
The crucial motion was that 'This
house has no faith in human nature',
and the highly skilled IC team of Matt
Desselberger and DebSoc chair Dan
Salmons naturally carried off the
prize, the Oxford Reference
Dictionary, signed by the judges and
presented by Lady Flowers.
