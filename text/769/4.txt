Union FELIX, Friday May 1st 1987 4
President's Prose
Fighting off those urges
GAY
NEWS
Hello and welcome back to sun-kissed
Imperial College. As I write this, there
is sun streaming into the office and I'm
having to fight of! urges to go and bask
in the warmth—surely a better option
than working. In short, it's typical
exam term weather...well. I hope
those of you taking exams aren't too
distracted by the heat—and I wish you
luck. Meanwhile, a few things of
interest.
The Great Presidential Election
Following the complete fiasco last
term, the presidential election is being
re-run. The Hustings UGM is next
Thursday, May 7th at 1pm; voting
takes place on Tuesday and
Wednesday, 12th and 13th of May. I
realise that an awful lot of people are
somewhat preoccupied by academic
matters at the moment, but if you can
spare the time please come along to
the Hustings and to vote. Nobody
would choose to have an election this
:erm but now we're stuck with it; so
please try and take part.
On the same subject, if anyone can
spare a few hours on May 12th and
13th and would like to earn a fewi
pounds for guarding ballot boxes (it's
not hard work and you can
read/revise at the same time), come
and see Jen or Dave Colley in the
Union Office as soon as possible.
More Wild and Wacky things
happening in the Union Building
On Wednesday from May 5th, Kate
from Studio 35 on Marloes Road will
be cutting hair for £5 a time in the
Ents. Committee Room (above the
new FELIX Office). We can certainly
vouch for Kate—whether your style is
wild and wacky or straightforward
and respectable; she's responsible not
only for my shorter cuts, but also for
Jackie's 'Glenda Jackson' look, Kathy's
wild waves and Jen's spiky
sophisticated image...however she's
got nothing to do with Gutman's
unique coiffure! So if anyone, male or
female, needs a haircut, come along
any Wednesday.
If you're working so hard this term
that you can't find time for shopping
and cooking, remember that the
Union Snack Bar is open for lunch
(10am—3pm) and supper (6pm—9pm)
with plenty of hot food and fresh
salads all at amazingly low prices.
There's plenty of room to sit in Beit
Quad and catch a bit of sun while you
eat.
NALGO Pay Claim
NALGO, the union representing
most of the College's clerical and
related staff, is currently negotiating
the 1987 pay claim. Clerical staff in
universities earn far less than their
counterparts in the private sector, and
no doubt this partially explains the
high turnover of staff at College. It's
a vicious circle; in times of financial
cuts to universities non-academic staff
salaries are liable to suffer; but if the
College is to run efficiently, good
administration staff are essential and
need to be paid accordingly. I only
hope that the outcome of the claim
reflects the vital role of clerical and
administration workers in academic
institutions.
Missing Persons
I've had a letter from a woman
called Joan, from Inverness. She's
trying to contact a student from New
York, probably called Eric. Eric is
about 21, 5' 10" tall with mousey hair.
He was in Inverness on 20th February
and went to a disco there called
"Dillingers", leaving at midnight. If this
is you, or you know someone who
might be 'Eric', come and see me as
there's a contact address for you. Yes,
this is serious and apparently Joan has
a very good reason for contacting
you!
That's it for now, have fun.
Christine
Sad to say, Robert Daniel has now left
Imperial for ever—could be a wise
move—but the work he undertook for
the gay and lesbian students of the
College lives on. If you check our
noticeboard, on the left hand side of
the foyer of the Union building, you
will see that we are now meeting in
the Green Committee Room on the
top floor of the Union Building, every
Wednesday at 12.30pm.
If you are gay or lesbian, and you've
told people about it, well done and
we'll be glad to see you. If you aren't,
try turning up anyway. You'll find us
a reasonably ordinary bunch, and you
might learn a thing or two about us.
But most importantly: If you are gay,
and you haven't told anyone, please
don't be afraid to come along and say
hello. Most of us have been in that
situation at some time; I will never
forget what it's like to conceal part of
yourself from everyone, even your
closest friends. Don't worry about
being seen on your way to the Green
Committee Room: 98% of IC students
probably don't know you, and I don't
suppose that the other two per cent
will realise where you are going.
Towards the end of last term FELIX
received a letter signed only by 'One
of the few' which saddened me
tremendously. In tone it was the
writing of someone who had almost
given up hope of ever being accepted,
or of being free to be themselves. I
f
the writer of that letter is reading this,
I implore them, or anyone like them,
to turn up on Wednesday and tell
someone about it. At the moment, that
is about the only way you can make
your life any better.
A final rousing chorus: I have always
been quite happy about my sexuality.
As a result of the support I have
received, sometimes from the most
unlikely people, I am now proud of it.
Thank you all.

N O T I C E
Would A L L clubs and societies collect your mail
from the Union or I will throw it in the bin! Also,
could you fill in the details of next year's committee
as soon as possible (details in your letter racks!).
Thanks,
Kathy Tait
