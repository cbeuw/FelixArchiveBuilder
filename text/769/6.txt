The Pimlico Connection 1987/88
UGC backs IC scheme to encourage
others to set up similar student
'tutoring' schemes
"It was a tremendous boost when I
overheard one pupil saying that she'd
learnt more in one lesson when I had
been explaining things to her than
she'd learnt the rest of the year''. This
comment by one of this year's IC
tutors sums up much of the
satisfaction and sense of achievement
participate in teaching Science. Maths
and 'CDT' at both secondary and
primary level in ILEA schools, with
Holland Park School currently
providing about half of the tutoring
places. Over seven thousand pupils
have now experienced tutoring by UC
undergraduates and show, through
annually completed questionnaires,
continued benefits from such tutoring.
In 1986/87 nearly fifty students
from eleven different departments
spent their Wednesday afternoons, up
At least half of the current tutors
have never had any intention of
teaching but have been attracted to the
scheme primarily by the opportunity
of having real practice in trying to
communicate scientific ideas at a
simple level, alongside professional
educators. This, combined with
insights gained from visiting multi-
ethnic inner-city schools with fellow
students, provides sufficient
motivation for most of those who
become tutors. There are some, of
teachers in the scheme, to learn about
the ILEA'S 'SMILE' Mathematics
programme, and gain some idea of the
fairly challenging role of a tutor
through simulation games and
discussion with former tutors.
As part of its scheme to improve the
dwindling supply of school teachers
in Mathematics, Physics and
Technology, the UGC has agreed to
fund an IC proposal by Dr Goodlad
to fund a Research and Project
Development Officer from September
that encourages students at Imperial
to join the College tutoring scheme,
known familiarly as the 'Pimlico
Connection'.
In 1975/76 the Pimlico School
became the first of six schools to have
a tutoring link with Imperial. Dr
Sinclair Goodlad had arranged for
twelve third-year Electrical
Engineering students to investigate
the feasibility of undergraduates
acting as 'tutors', by assisting
teachers in 'combined science'
classes. The initial, three-year phase
of research was funded by the
Leverhulme Foundation as part of Dr
Goodlad's ongoing research into
'study-service' in the UK and USA.
Now completing its twelfth year,
this IC tutoring scheme has enabled
nearly seven hundred students to
until the end of January, in five
schools. Nearly a third of the tutors
were female, providing useful 'role-
models' for pupils who often associate
science exclusively with men.
More information about the IC
tutoring scheme and applications for
1987/88 is available from the
Humanities Department, 53 Prince's
Gate. The 'Pimlico Connection
Society', a students' union society,
will have at least one meeting during
the term to welcome its new
committee and any prospective tutors/
interested students. The Society
usually meets in the Electrical
Engineering building. This year's
officers are Keith Bell of Chem Eng
4 (Chairman and Treasurer) and
Richard Bleasdale of Elec Eng 4
(Social Secretary).
course, who wish to see whether their
ideas of being teachers stand up to the
test of reality or not. It can be really
useful to know if one is not suited
rather than spending a postgraduate
year of teacher training to find out.
Or, as one of this year's tutors put it:
"The Pimlico connection scheme
helped me make up my mind about
not teaching. My reasons were
complicated, but at least now I'll not
pursue my career wondering what
teaching would have been like. I do
now have some idea. Anyway,
regardless of this I think the
experience of the scheme is very
valuable in itself."
All prospective tutors are
encouraged to attend a training
session on the first Saturday of the
Autumn term to meet some of the
1987/89. This appointment will draw
on the unique experience gained at
Imperial to increase awareness,
nationally, of how such tutoring
schemes can operate, and, if possible,
to establish at least one other, similar,
scheme in London. The post is likely
to be suitable for a teacher on
secondment, as advertised this week
in The Guardian.
No experience needed. Why not
join the 'Pimlico Connection' now!
