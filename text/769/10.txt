FELIX FELIX, Friday May 1st 1987 1 0
COLLEGEBURY
The only true certainty is the absence
of news. The rest is just void, the
vultures of popular opinion, the
missing Baron, desolation. A
thousand editorials flash from the
rollers, desperate pleas to the
deafening silence of dumbness.
I walked through the union building
today. The audio circulation pushed
wisdom from my mind. The words of
reform banished to a vegetarian plate,
the mushrooms of futility. They
gnawed at my toes, stamped on my
head, chided. pushed and abused.
Demanding the gods of revelation, the
idols of sport, the dread cold
emptiness of rhetoric. They stared at
me. but I was invisible. A name on
the page, never a face to them. My
words, their daggers, all the pointless
bickering are naught to the clock on
the wall, the endless clack clack clack
of the folding machine.
My preprocessed, digitised,
electronic thoughts spew from
unconscious machine to unconscious
machine through woodpulped
interfaces of pretence. And I realise
the terrible limitations, the paralyzing
insurmountable inadequacies of the
situation, life in a papyrus fortress.
Maming truth, the fog of competition
closes in on the struggle for
revelation. Why do we strive for
enlightenment but crumble beneath
petty terrestrial considerations? So
much to do. so little time to
accomplish nothing. Crucified on an
ever rising hill of peurility, sterility,
inadequacy and triviality in a barren
wasteland of mindlessness and
ineptitude. I swing from their hooks
of insanity. Inane requests seeking an
orgasm of ego enrichment assault my
tower of truth. The power of the press
versus the forces of ignorance, a
titanic struggle of coherence against
a whirlpool of the unimaginative
dregs of academia, form my raison
d'etre.
The Editors Ja
Glass in hand, I await the
triumphant arrival of another Friday.
Eyelids strain to reach the new day,
the next edition, reaction, interest,
some cognition. They never really
care, and I am doomed to try again
and again. I coax shock,
aggrievement, the food of feedback,
shouting at an abyss of apathy.
Collating the wit and wisdom of
another week, they struggle to muster
the last vestiges of enthusiasm from
their rapidly shrinking minds.
Nicotine doped, caffine stoned, bleary
eyed automatons shuffle, shuffle,
shuffle the dwindling piles of
revelation, as they crawl towards the
birth of a new edition. I stare across
the print room, as the ink flows, and
the paper rips through my mind. I do
my job. I survive amid this paucity
of imagination, talent and reality. The
only certainty in a sea of delusion is
that there is never ever any news.
