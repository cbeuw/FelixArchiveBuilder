Clubs FELIX, Friday May 1st 1987 9
Women's VIII's Head of the River, 14th March,
Mortlake to Putney
Miracle Workers
The most important annual eights
event between Mortlake and Putney
took place on Saturday March 14th.
Imperial women's squad, comprising
9 dedicated members?? selected 8
oarswomen and a cox to enter as a ???
crew. They stomped home 61st out
of an unusually large field of over a
thousand. This was a quite
remarkable result for a crew of such
mixed experience although they were
aiming for the top sixty.
Mega-coaches Richard Evans and
Tim Lohmann (of Lohmann Rowing
Club) worked miracles with those
who only started rowing in October,
and attempted to correct the odd crew
member who had been rowing badly
for years. Despite only being able to
row together as an eight on a few
occasions, exceptionally hard training
throughout the winter paid off. Good
spirits in the boat and excellent coxing
from Diana Montgomery resulted in
a row worthy of a crew of higher
status.
Oxford is not the only crew to
impart muscle from the States.
Colleen Kaleta arrived at the last
minute to train for the race, just as
-Mandy Phillips was recovering from
serious illness to take up her place in
the bow. Charlotte Evans and Alison
Lapp overcame a sizeable problem by
being incredibly fit. Amazing
performances also from Bridget
Farnon, Pam Evans and Kathy
Marriot. I was in the boat as well.
The squad is now anticipating an
outstanding regatta season.
Bow: A Phillips, A Capp,
K Marriott, B Farnon, C Evans,
C Kaleta, P Sansom, R Thomson
(Sir), D Montgomery.
Water Polo
Secret
Weapons
On Sunday 15th March at 3.00pm,
teams from Tizard and Selkirk met to
contest the inter-hall gala. Due to
Linstead hiding outside for an hour,
Selkirk and Tizard displayed their
prowess in water polo, until Linstead
could be enticed to wet their feet.
The gala commenced at four
o'clock with Linstead taking an early
lead through ULU swimmer, Steve.
As the gala proceeded, Selkirk fell by
the wayside, largely due to their
female contingent being too demure
to show themselves. Tizard crawled
up, and as the last relay was
announced, there was just half a point
between Tizard and Linstead.
Tizard's secret weapons—Shark
Fin (John) and Oppy (Simon) led off
for them, giving an early advantage,
which was held by brilliant
performances from Pete 'Submarine'
Gilbert and Aquatic Emma. Team
captain Nikki splashed the next 25m,
followed by 'the unknown swimmer'
Neil. Gremlin Gizmo (Ian) set up the
final leg for Kipper (Dave Wall) to
seize the championship for Tizard. A
special mention must go to Tracy,
who showed style with the inflatables,
thanks to Andrew and James for their
organisation (although they lost—ha
ha).
Dramsoc

Dance Club
Off Beat Performance
The end of last term saw the highlight
of the dancing calender for Imperial
College Dance Club.
On the 28th February the Southern
Universities Ball was held, hosted by
Southampton, with Imperial taking
two teams of four couples to compete.
Despite strong opposition, notably
from Cambridge and Oxford
Universities, all but one of our
couples successfully progressed
through three heats to reach the semi
finals. A particularly encouraging and
enthusiastic performance was given
by Steve Mercer and Alice Jacques,
who had only started dancing this year
but still managed to get through to the
semi finals of the jive competition.
Our finalists included Neil
McCluskey and Dinah Woodhurst in
the jive, Simon Denyer and Rachel
Conder in the quickstep and also Ruth
Steadman and Sharad Somany in the
cha-cha-cha. They were placed 5th,
7th and 6th respectively. Success was
achieved when, performing our
version of "Greased Lightning",
Imperial College won the offbeat
competition at the end of the evening.
On March 14th the Inter-Varsity
Ball was held at Bristol with
competitors coming from as far away
as Edinburgh to compete.
Imperial took 4 couples along to
compete and also their victorious
offbeat team. A sparkling
performance by Neil McCluskey and
Dinah Woodhurst won them 2nd
place in the final of the jive, with two
other couples reaching the semi finals.
Yet again the offbeat team was
placed 1st after a somewhat
complacent performance, but with an
exciting interpretation by Will
McDonald and Sarah Rogles.
Special thanks must go to Vikki
Cunniffe, our dancing instructor and
her husband, Harry, for services
rendered.
