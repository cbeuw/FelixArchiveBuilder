SPECIFIC NETWORK AND STRATEGIC
PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES
The merging of switching and transmission technologies and the commitment of BT
to modernise its network and provide customers with new features at competitive
prices has led to a re-appraisal of the network structure.
A major division in BT, UK Communications, has recently been set up to establish
the economics of various options and to take these forward to specific
implementation plans. The work will have a high profile in the business and will
provide successful applicants with exceptional career opportunities.
We wish to attract the best graduates available and are interested primarily in
motivation and intellect, thus a scientific degree is not essential.
Contact John Green on 01-829 3337 for further details. All applications on a
Standard Application Form to be forwarded to Gey nor Cannings, UK
Communications Personnel, Room 1119, 151 Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BA,
Freefone 2237, by May 15 1987.
