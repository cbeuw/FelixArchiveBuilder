Does caffeine enhance sport performance?
Holly Plumley
Caffeine acts as a stimulant on the
central nervous system, which causes
the heart rate and blood pressure to
increase. After having caffeine, an in-
dividual may temporarily feel more
awake and energetic. Caffeine also acts
as a diuretic, which causes the kidneys
to excrete more urine.
Research provided by the American
College of Sports Medicine (ACSM)
has shown that ingestion of 3-9 mg
of caffeine per kilogram (kg) of body
weight one hour prior to exercise in-
creased endurance running and cy-
cling performance of well-trained,
recreational athletes in the laboratory.
This compares to approximately 2-6
regular size cups of coffee.
Many of the reasons for and against
whether caffeine enhances sports per-
formance are conflicting as there is still
much research that needs to be done
on the effects of caffeine on perform-
ance. There are also ethical issues in
relation to sports, caffeine ingestion
currently is not illegal in sports but
high doses of caffeine are considered
illegal by the International Olympic
Committee. If an athlete deliberately
takes pure caffeine to gain advantage
over competitors, it is considered un-
ethical and doping by many.
So how does this affect you? First
lets look more into the effect caffeine
has on the body. After taking caffeine
you may notice an: increase in heart
rate and pulse, increase in breathing,
increase in adrenaline, you feel awake
and alert - especially in the morning,
you feel less drowsy and tired, you can
concentrate better, you can think more
clearly.
Caffeine is found in coffee, tea,
soft drinks and chocolate. In smaller
amounts it is an active ingredient in
cold and flu remedies, decongestants
and painkillers. Things we know all too
well and eat or drink as part of our dai-
ly diet, for some people 3-4 times a day.
Generally: 200-500mg/day is regarded
as moderate use; 600-750mg/day is re-
garded as high use and over 1,000mg/
day is regarded as a toxic amount.
Caffeine’s stimulant effect peaks
about an hour after consumption and
declines as the liver breaks it down.
If you occasionally drink coffee, you
tend to be more sensitive to caffeine’s
stimulant effect compared to the daily
coffee drinkers who have developed a
tolerance to it.
It is important to be aware that pro-
longed and frequent caffeine intake
can lead to side effects which can
cause the following: anxiety and nerv-
ousness, sleep problems, headache
and tremor, restlessness and irritabil-
ity, produces more stomach acid and
urine, nausea and stomach complaints
(heartburn, indigestion, may aggravate
ulcers), tense muscles, palpitations and
irregular heart beats, increase in blood
pressure.
According to the ACSM, for the av-
erage adult who is exercising with the
goals of enjoyment and self-improve-
ment, using caffeine defeats these
purposes. Although you may feel as
though you are increasing perform-
ance, it may be more related to the in-
crease in alertness and energy due to
elevated heart rates.
Proper training and nutritional hab-
its such as eating a meal high in car-
bohydrates 2 hours before a workout
are more sensible and productive ap-
proaches. And these have clear ben-
efits without the side effects.

After exercise, caffeine is a poor
choice for fluid replacement. The best
bet is to replace with a non-caffeinated
drink such as water just after the activ-
ity, and then later if you so desire, enjoy
your favourite caffeinated beverage - in
moderation!
To finish, caffeine affects each per-
son’s performance differently. In an-
swer to the question will it enhance
your performance? It’s a case of trial
and error that will indicate the best
practices regarding caffeine intake
for your body for instance if caffeine
makes you queasy or light-headed dur-
ing exercise, don’t use it!
