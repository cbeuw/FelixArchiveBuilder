Imperial Team of the Week
This week, Sports Partnership along
with Felix Sport have chosen the
Football Women’s 1st team as their
‘Team of the Week’.
The girls have had a mixed bag of
results, yet they still seem to be doing
well despite the fact that they have
not been getting a full team out.
Last week they beat Bedfordshire
with 9 players, and the week before
hat they beat RUMS with 8. In their
latest match, the girls had 10 play-
ers and managed a draw aagainst St.
George’s, whilst at the weekend the
girls managed to get a full team out
and whoop Goldsmith’s 5 – 1.
Hopefully, with a full strength
squad, the girls will be able to pro-
duce such wins as they did at the
weekend and work their way up the
league table.
Well done ladies!

With only one victory under our belt
this season, the ladies 2’s were eager
for some more goal pie and hopefully
to start a new winning streak. So last
Wednesday, the team arrived at Har-
lington in high spirits despite the freez-
ing weather, ready to face our brand
new opposition who calls themselves
BUCKS!
The game started positively, with IC
making most of the attacks initially,
forcing BUCKS to defend. However,
it wasn’t long before they answered
with some swift counter-attacks. Nev-
ertheless, our solid defensive wall of
Thombelina, 3 Times a Lady, Unicycle
and Dominator performed brilliantly
to clear any looming danger, making
life for Spanner relatively easy.
The first half ended frustratingly
with an empty score line as IC failed
to convert numerous chances. After
some inspirational team talk from
resident team manager Porno Fi and
Captain Ghostbuster as well as half
time oranges courtesy of Dominator,
the team started the second half ready
and refreshed and as a consequence,
scored within the first few minutes! A
change in the short corner routine saw
Brownie sweep the ball past the keep-
er. The game carried on with some
smooth passing up front between AA,
Did you know that among the subur-
ban streets of leafy Teddington you
can find the home ground of one of
the oldest and most successful rugby
clubs in the country? Far less imposing
than England’s Twickenham Stadium
or Harlequins’s Stoop, Imperial Medi-
cals’s ground on Udney Park Road
makes up for what it lacks in stature
with its rich history.
Formerly, belonging to St. Mary’s
Hospital in Paddington the ground
came under the custodianship of Im-
perial College in 1997, after the union
of St Mary’s Hospital and Charing
Cross & Westminster Hospitals Medi-
cal School to form Imperial College
School of Medicine (ICSM). With the
union of the Medical Schools also came
the amalgamation of their respective
rugby clubs (St Mary’s Hospital R.F.C.
founded in 1865 and Charing Cross &
Westminster Hospitals R.F.C. founded
in 1984) to form Imperial Medicals
RFC.
Whilst the days since St Mary’s pro-
vided a sizeable number of players to
the home nation’s national sides are,
due to the advent of the professional
Jess and Ghostbuster coupled with ex-
cellent defending when necessary. Our
hard work paid off and IC gained a few
short corners as the minutes of the
game dwindled. The ball was pushed
out by AA to Ghostbuster who stopped
it and fed it into the D then a superb
strike from Unicycle saw the ball finish
its path at the back of the goal before
the final whistle was promptly blown.
IC 2’s finished the match all smiles
and Man of the Match was awarded to
Hoover for a fantastic performance.

Williams [Wales & British Lions] and
‘Tuppy’ Owen-Smith [England], who
joined the hospital with a triple blue
from Oxford (cricket, rugby, box-
ing) and also played cricket for South
Africa). Imperial Medicals can still
boast four recent England Students
representatives and one England 7’s
representative.
Currently the club plays its rugby
in the BUSA Rugby Union – Premier
Division (South) and in RFU London
3 (North West), just 3 tiers below the
National Leagues. Additionally, the
Medicals are current holders of the
United Hospitals Cup, the oldest rugby
competition in the world, which they
have won 7 out of the last 8 years and
the JPR Williams Cup, played against
Imperial College, which they have won
every year since its inception.
This summer from 6th to 20th July
2008 Imperial Medicals RFC will be
touring South Africa in a project com-
bining their two main passions; rugby
and medicine. In a packed schedule the
club will visit six towns, play 7 match-
es, including games against the Kruger
National Park Rangers and Swaziland
National Team (followed by a recep-

tion with the high-commissioner of
Swaziland) and carry out humanitari-
an work such as: offering their medical
services at local clinics, helping with
building projects and coaching school
rugby teams.
Such an endeavour requires financial
support not only from the players in-
volved but also sponsorship, which the
club is actively seeking. In addition,
a number of fund raising events have
been planned including a Christmas
Bop on the last day of term – Friday
14th December, a tour dinner, with
Harlequins’ World Cup players as
guests, on Saturday March 1st and a
pre-tour warm up match against Lon-
don South Africa at Richmond RFC.
Furthermore, if you are attending any
of England’s home Six Nations match-
es look out for some of the players sell-
ing raffle tickets offering the chance to
win rugby memorabilia, international
match tickets, weekend breaks, ham-
pers and cases of wine.
If you would like more informa-
tion or can support the tour through
sponsorship or by attending the fund-
raising events, please contact Interna-
tional Tour Captain Ben Allin (bsa04@

In the last two weeks the most socially
active hockey club at gimperial has
seen it all: from drunken disastrous
dancing in Dbs to drunken disastrous
dancing in Belushis proving its not the
place you go to its who you go there
with.
This aside hockey has been as active
as ever beating the air squadron 11-3
and George’s Medics 12-1. Please let
me take the time to point out that the
air squadron team did have an ex Eng-
land player on their side and although
most people (except maybe Tom ;o) )
know hockey is not a one man sport I

thought it was worth a mention. Goals
have been scored by most of the team
(except for Steve) so an all around con-
grats especially those of you who have
managed loads e.g Ravi and to Joe,
Mikey and Sang for their Man Of The
Match nominations (a weeks drink-
ing is stopping me from remembering
who actually got it…). And although I
wasn’t at the game last Sunday I hear
there was more of the same. The next
few weeks see the girls get their first
solo match and with Timmay and
Steve umpiring it is sure to be a great
fare honest clean game with no unbi-
ased umpiring as seen in the past... No
names need be mentioned…
