That’s not curry! That’s dog crap
Felix loves its readers and doesn’t want to see you fooled into tucking into sub-standard curries. That’s why
this week, David Stewart gives us the skinny on where to get an authentic Indian experience in London
Here’s a delicious dish for you all to try unless, of course, you’re chicken!
“T
hat tears it,” I
screamed. “It’s your
problem if you want
to shove the devil’s
shit down your gul-
let but don’t drag innocents into your
sordid affairs.” My quite reasonable
outburst occurred when I heard some-
one explaining in oh-so-authoritative
tones how ‘if one wants a really au-
thentic Indian experience, one goes to
Brick Lane.’
It’s a funny word: ‘authentic’, used al-
most exclusively to denote something
which is as far from what it claims
to be as possible; it’s a word which is
specifically directed at tourists to sug-
gest to them that they are getting the
‘real deal’ as opposed to a substandard
product. ‘Authentic Indian Cuisine’ is
probably as bad as it gets. India is huge.
There is no such thing as Indian Cui-
sine - there are such things as Punjabi
Cuisine, Gujarati Cuisine, Rajasthani
Cuisine and so forth, although ‘cuisine’
itself is a ludicrous word when ‘cook-
ing’ would do just as well.
Brick Lane has not changed much
since about 1970 when the local Bang-
ladeshi community started putting up
restaurants to feed London with an-
glicised versions of the Punjabi dishes
it had encountered in the days of the
Raj. Very quickly, England realised that
it preferred Chicken Tikka Masala to
Lamb chops and Bisto; well there’s no
surprise there, it probably was rather
better, but standards haven’t improved
since then. We still seem to queue up
to sit down in high back chairs on thick
pile carpet heavy with the stench of old
food chugging down tasteless watered
down lager and chomping poppadoms
with sauces from jars. And then the
food.
Here’s how to cook a curry in a res-
taurant in Brick Lane: take a handful
of defrosted then pre-cooked chicken
breast, a ladelful of carcinogenic curry
paste that you’ve bought at Makro and
half a pot of cream. Heat it all up and
serve with a handful of coriander on
the top.
If it’s not obvious, let me explain how
wrong this is: (a) a curry is supposed to
be a slow cooked dish where the aro-
matic flavours of the spices have suffi-
cient time to impregnate the meat, (b)
chicken leg is better than breast when
cooked slowly as its texture softens in-
stead of hardening. (c) curry pastes are
saturated with vinegar and preserva-
tives and every possible ingredient
under the sun instead of well chosen,
freshly ground spices.
What’s the solution? Excellent out-
lets serving specialised Indian food in
London do exist. Tooting is the closest
Indian community to the centre and
has great Sri Lankan (= Ceylon) food.
The BYO policies mean you can end up
spending less than a tenner a head for
more than you could possibly finish. A
great bet is Apollo Banana Leaf, though
Rhada Krishna Bhavan is pretty good
too. There are also excellent places
dotted around town. More Sri Lankan
food can be found at the very cheap Sa-
gar (vegetarian) in Hammersmith.
At (your parents’) great expense you
can enjoy contemporary indian food at
Benares in Mayfair where Atul Kochha
brandishes a Michelin star, or there’s
the Red Fort in Soho for a Moglai feast
or High Street Kensington’s Zaika is a
great venue.
In the mid-range I love the seafood
at Rasa Samudra on Charlotte street,
but for Wagamama’s style pricing the
best options in London are Chowki on
Denman St, Masala Zone in Islington/
Soho/Covent Garden/Earl’s Court,
or Imli on Wardour Street. All these
three offer pan-indian options, usually
as a Thali (a sort of mixed selection)
with vibrant fresh spicing and a good
doff of the hat to the dishes’ respec-
tive regions of origin. There really is
no need to shovel the devil’s shit down
your gullet.
There has been a recent conver-
gence of roast chicken thought
around recipes similar to this
one. Some of the latest and most
respected cook books out there
prescribe very similar processes,
for example Hugh Fearnley-Whit-
tingstall’s River Cottage Meat
Book, and Simon Hopkinson’s
Roast Chicken and other stories.
I believe this represents the to-
date accumulated wisdom re-
garding this timeless classic, and
so I’m calling it cutting edge. It’s
a very resilient beast, and could
easily be done with just chicken,
butter, a lemon and white wine,
so chop and change ingredients
at will. I’ve given directions in
order that include the roast po-
tatoes, so this ought to set you
up for your first roast, if you can
manage the veg.
Ingredients
For the chicken:
A chicken!
100g Butter
2 cloves Garlic
Thyme (or whatever herbs you
have to hand)
One lemon
Salt and Pepper
For the roast potatoes:
Versatile white potatoes (King
Edwards often suggested)
Goose fat or sunflower oil for
roasting
Instructions
1) Set the oven to 220 degrees
2) Peel potatoes, and get a full ket-
tle boiling. Chop them into golf ball
size bits and boil in a well salted
pan for 8 minutes (from when they
start to boil). NB They should cook
nearly all the way through, and you
can feel for this with a knife.
3) While potatoes are cooking,
prepare the chicken:
a. Get rid of the string on it.
b. Cut off excess fat around the
cavity
c. Mash the garlic with some salt
and a fork, and mix with the but-
ter (soften in a microwave), pepper
and herbs (remove thyme leaves
from stalks).
d. Rub the butter mix all over the
chicken, inside and out
e. Place breast up in a neat fitting
tray (not too big)
f. Cut the lemon in half and place
inside the cavity
4) Drain potatoes and place on a
board, well spaced out to cool
5) Place the chicken in the mid-
dle of the oven to give it 20 mins at
220. Place a tray for the potatoes at
the top of the oven, with fat a few
millimetres deep in the bottom of it
– it needs to heat up before adding
the potatoes, which should fit with
ample space.
6) Scratch the surfaces of the
cooled potatoes with a fork, and
sprinkle with salt.

7) Turn the oven down to 180,
take out the hot fat tray and add the
potatoes, spooning fat over them
thoroughly. Also at this stage, add
a small glass of white wine to the
chicken pan.
8) The chicken will need an-
other 40-60 mins depending on
its size (1.4 kg is small, 1.8kg is
big), HOWEVER, this timing is a
key adjustment. You are aiming
for two things: firstly a crisp skin
all over, and secondly lots of nice
burnt sludgey bits at the bottom of
the pan. I can’t overestimate how
important they are for gravy, so if
these things haven’t happened,
give it longer. Adding too much
wine can ruin this also. If you’re
worried it’s under done, make a cut
where the leg meets the breast –
any hint of red in the juices and it
needs longer.
9) When you are happy with
crispy skin and burnt sludge, take
out the chicken, tilt it to spill its
juice into the tray. Remove it from
its tray and let it rest on a board for
15 mins while you make the veg.
10) Turn the potatoes in the fat
and whack up the heat to finish
them off and get them crispy.
11) Also at this stage you make
the gravy. Take the chicken tray
all gungey and burnt looking, and
place it on the heat. Add another
splash of white wine and scrape
all the magical residues loose with
a wooden spoon. Judgement and
constant tasting come in here… a
few pointers:
a. If there’s not enough liquid,
add some boiling water from the
veg (but a little concentrated fla-
vour is better in general)
b. Squeezings from the lemon in
the chicken may work
c. A dab of redcurrant jelly too.
d. If you’re lacking in flavour, or
need to increase volume, then gra-
vy granules are definitely accept-
able (unless you want to make a
stock reduction meat glaze… didn’t
think so!)
e. Gravy granules will thicken,
but if not needed then slake a
teaspoon of cornflour in a mug
with cold water (avoids lumps)
before whisking in.
12) Carve and serve.
I think there are too many varia-
bles to control here to be precise
about the recipe, which is why
I’ve emphasised use of judge-
ment. That’s the real fun of cook-
ing anyway.
Now boys and girls here’s a quick test to see if you’ve been paying attention. Which would you rather have?
