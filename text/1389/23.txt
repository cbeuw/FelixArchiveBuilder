It’s gettin’ nippy oootside
A
s the Ice Age arrives
here in London, days
are shortening and nip-
ples are peaking. Your
limbs are going black
with frostbite and you wouldn’t be
seen dead in the ‘what the f**k were
you thinking?’ spur-of-the-moment
mistake from last year. Your social life
is dwindling down to a night-in by the
fireplace, and your friends are starting
to think you’re actually a pensioner in
disguise because it’s always “too nippy
to leave the house.”
You, my son, need a new coat and
fast.
Take off that duffel coat you’ve had
since you were 13, just burn that fluo-
rescent bomber; and buy a nice, new,
Daniel Wan trawls through mountains of wool and polyester for the sake of fashion
The standard black Pea-coat from
Topman, a majority blend of wool
and polyester, and one of the safest
and most reasonable options out
there at £70. Get the right size and
you can’t go wrong.
The large collar and lapel means
you can wear it further up against
your neck for extra coverage, and
look like Eric Cantona whilst you
do it.
The only downside to this pur-
chase is that you’re still spending
£70 on something you’ll see several
million other people wearing.
Topman breed clones, and now
I’m just starting to get a sense of
deja-vu. However, this coat is styl-
ish and understated enough to just
about get away with it.
This River Island Pea-coat is
slightly longer than the Topman
one, and should end just below the
waist. In other words, more arse-
coverage, which in turn, equals a
warm backside and that’s always a
good thing, right?
For £5 more than the Topman
Pea coat (at £75), this coat emits a
lot more style, hanging in between
Victorian-military and cutting-edge
modern. On top of this you do end
up looking like the 6th member of
Kasabian too.
It only comes in grey, which may
not go with absolutely everything
you wear underneath. Also be wary
of the quality of River Island win-
terwear. It may not last one week,
never mind one winter.
This double breasted crombie from
River Island takes another few inches
down from the previous cut. It should
endonyourthighs,givingago-between
short and three-quarter lengths.
The wool-polyester blend will ensure
toastiness whilst waiting for your 6am
bus, and the contrast trim on lapels
and pocket flaps add a very stylish and
dapper addition to the bog-standard
black jacket.
This could potentially be worn over
a suit to work, or with a pullover and
jeans on the weekend. Its simplicity in
style and versatility gives makes this
coat a great purchase,
With a twinge of British schoolboy
and an exciting edge, River Island have
delivered the goods once again. At
£89.99, it’s certainly worth the money
you’d have to shell out for it, even on
looks alone.
Military-inspired winterwear has been
prevalent for the past few years, and
is starting to overwhelm the market.
However, this “Neonair” Pea-coat by
Full Circle is given a complete makeo-
ver from its more conventional Pea
coat counterparts.
Normally, faux-fur trims on any-
thing look overbearing or just plain
tacky, but this jacket manages to pull
it off with a certain degree of subtlety.
Nevertheless, the black fur collar is de-
tachable. The traditional double row of
buttons is scrapped in favour of an off-
centre row of functional buttons com-
plemented with a concealed half zip.
Available at Urban Outfitters, but
this jacket’s recommended retail price
of £210 may send you into your over-
draft all over again.
Tweed is no longer only for old men
and geography teachers, and this coat
proves it.
This coat by Ringspun drops three
quarters down the body, and is a more
obvious fitted cut than the three-quar-
ter lengths found in Topman or River
Island.
It features an adjustable backbelt, al-
lowing the coat to follow natural body
shape tightly, or to hang a bit looser.
The mid-brown tweed refuses to look
dated and is a refreshing colour from
crowds of black and greys; yet is still
understated enough to blend in for
general use.
Despite being only 25% wool, it is
available from ASOS.com for £115,
not including postage and packaging.
Even coats nowadays are subject to
‘East meets West’ amalgamations, and
here’s a prime example.
This is Burton’s most interesting of-
fering this season. A lot of their range is
very similar and fairly generic, but this
subtle variation on a standard waist
dropping black Pea-coat. The obliga-
tory double-breasted button rows are
present, but it also features an interest-
ing Mandarin collar.
You might end up looking like a
priest if you wear a high-neck white
shirt underneath, but you take that risk
with a lot of things.
There’s not much you can do this
coat however. Wearing a scarf with this
type of collar might prove difficult, and
wearing the jacket open ruins the look.
Style over practicality for £85.
It seems you can’t escape looking like
either an armyman or a hooligan.
This casual cotton ‘Detroit field
jacket’ from Full Circle features draw-
string waist and hem for extra snug-
ness amongst the winter chill.
Standard zip and popper combina-
tion, and a choice of green or black,
Urban Outfitters retail this jacket at
£115.
However, it is alarmingly similar to a
£20 ‘German’ field jacket found in army
surplus stores (notorious in Camden),
and from personal experience you’re
always in danger of looking like a hobo
everytime you sit down outside (I once
got a free pastry from Starbucks be-
cause I was wearing this jacket…)
Certainly not a coat you can wear
a suit under, but like the parka, its
warmth outstrips its rather shabby
aesthetic.
stylish coat. It’s a sure-fire way to a life
of sex, money, drugs and most impor-
tantly warmth.
“There’s so many coats, they all look
so damn warm, which one do I pick?!”
I hear you say.
The High Street is offering a lot
more then ever before. No longer will
you have to subject yourself to M&S
or mail-order catalogues to find a nice,
dapper coat. Menswear stores such as
Burton or Topman now offer a whole
range of different categories of jackets.
So here’s a quick rundown of the
latest offerings on the high street this
chilly British winter, just to save you
some valuable time in which you could
be thawing your knackers on Gran’s
fireplace.
Puffball skirts & dresses
Supercute over a T-shirt. Espe-
cially the Preen-a-like cocktail
dresses that the High Street
are ripping off.
Romantic Rock look
The soft frilliness of the
Romantic look superimposed
with the toughness of rock
style. Think puffball skirt with
a pair of black studded ankle
boots.
Marks’n‘Sparks New Ad
Campaign
Not to be ageist, although my
next words possibly disqualify
that, but why is Twiggy in
this advert as a love inter-
est? Fair enough when her
object of affection is Antonio
Bandaras, but she looks like
the other models’ mother.
If you accumulated all the
other models’ wrinkles, it still
wouldn’t equate to how many
are on Twiggy’s face. It’s just
wrong. Just because she was
on ANTM does not make her
relevant.
