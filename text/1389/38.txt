Stress affects everyone at some time in
his or her life. Research suggests that
a moderate amount of stress can be
positive, making us more alert, helping
to keep us motivated, and making us
perform better. However, if we are not
in control over our situation then too
much stress can cause illness and phys-
ical and emotional problems, including
headaches, upset stomach, high blood
pressure and even strokes or heart dis-
ease. Stress is a well known trigger for
depression and stress-related medical
problems are becoming more and more
common. In the modern world, we all
need to learn how to cope with stress.
It is therefore important to identify the
causes of stress in your life and try to
minimise them.
All sorts of situations can cause
stress from major life events such as
unemployment, moving house, start-
ing university to minor irritations such
as feeling undervalued at work or be-
ing stuck in traffic. Sometimes there
are no obvious causes. Some people
seem to suffer from stress more than
other people. These people are called
‘type A’ by psychologists and they tend
to be impatient and sometimes aggres-
sive. They also seem to have a higher
incidence level of heart attacks. People
who abuse alcohol or drugs are also
more likely to suffer from stress. Some
common signs of too much stress in-
clude: increased irritability, experienc-
ing many different feelings, including
anxiety, fear, anger, frustration and
depression. and signs of tension, such
as nail-biting, drinking and smoking
more, indigestion, loss of concentra-
tion, chest pains, lack of appetite, feel-
ing sick, constant tiredness, due to
difficulty getting to sleep, craving for
food, restlessness and a tendency to
sweat are also signs.
When you are stressed, your body
produces more of the so called ‘fight or
flight’ chemicals, adrenaline and no-
radrenalin, which prepare your body
for an emergency. Adrenaline and no-
radrenaline raise your blood pressure,
makes your heart beat faster and in-
crease the rate at which you perspire.
They can also reduce your stomach
activity and reduce blood flow to your
skin. Cortisol releases fat and sugar into
your system as well as reduces the ef-
ficiency of your immune system. Over
time these chemicals and the changes
they produce can damage your physi-
cal and mental health.
Adrenaline and noradrenaline use
up large amounts of vitamin C, B-vita-
mins, magnesium and zinc, because it’s
an emergency, they take priority over
the body’s general use for these nutri-
ents. Vitamin C and zinc are therefore
not sufficiently available for collagen
production to make white blood cells
to fend off infections and to keep skin
clear. B-vitamins are not fully avail-
able for mental function and energy
production. Low levels of magnesium
might result in headaches and raised
blood pressure. Increased stress levels
also raise the amount of oxidation dam-
age, which affects various body tissues.
Constantly raised cortisol levels keep
the body in a ‘catabolic’ state, which
interferes with tissue repair which is
important when exercising.
Stress can play an important role in
the epidemic of obesity. Obesity shows
a connection between stress factors
and increasing cortisol. Studies show
that stress contributes to increased
food intake, since it is interfering with
the neuroendocrine mechanisms re-
sulting in an increasing appetite. An
increase of cortisol results in an accu-
mulation of body fat around the waist
area.
If stress is causing physical symp-
toms, severe distress or making it dif-
ficult for you to function as normal, it
is worth seeing the doctor. One of the
first steps to cope with stress is learn-
ing to recognise your personal signs
and symptoms. The way you function
on a daily basis may change, or you
may notice a difference in your body i.e.
tense shoulders, the way you think, or
general sense of wellbeing. Is the cause
for your stress a real threat? Or are you
worried over nothing? Be proactive
and take responsibility for your actions
rather than passively waiting for things
to get better. You will get an increased
feeling of competence and self-esteem.
Stress management will for example
help you target the causes of stress in
your life quickly and effectively, learn
how better to cope with pressure, re-
duce stress with rational thinking, im-
prove working relationships and how
to live a happier, more relaxed life. This
will be done by changing your subcon-
scious, your feelings and beliefs, in-
creasing your sense of calm and well
being, and also enable change in your
conscious thoughts and behaviours.
There are several strategies that can
help you deal with stress: try to identify
the underlying causes of your stress.
You may need to review your whole
lifestyle. Eating a healthy, balanced
diet, rich in fruit and vegetables, keep
smoking and drinking at a minimum,
learning to be more assertive, never
taking on more than you know you can
cope with, organising your time better
to get as much done as possible, find-
ing humour or absurdity in stressful
situations, talking to friends or family,
sharing your thoughts and fears, and
tensing and then relaxing your muscles
starting at the toes and working up to
the head and neck.
Ethos can help you manage your
stress levels with exercise programmes,
weight management programmes,
stress management and life coaching
programmes – pop in and speak to

Week 7 and a lot more results are in.
The ranking of the teams is based on
the Felix Index (FI), which is calculated
as follows: FI = (W*5) + (D*2) – (L*4).
Only teams with 5 games or more will
be considered in the overall champion-
ship at the end of year.
With this week’s results in, Net-
ball 1st, Squash Men’s 1st and Tennis
Men’s 2nd (this week’s Team of the
Week) continue their unbeaten streak
and are top of the table with 25 points
each. With the Hockey Men’s 1st los-
ing their fixture on Wednesday, they
slip 5 places to 9th and are replaced by
Rugby Men’s 1st in 4th place.
A mid table scrap is beginning to
emerge between the men’s Badminton
2s and Rugby 3s, as well as the ladies
Football, Lacrosse and Squash
At the bottom of the table, the poor
start to the season by Hockey Men’s
4th and Football Men’s 2nd, leave them
both rooted to the bottom of the table.
