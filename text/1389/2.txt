Immigration Nation Flash mob on Dalby Court
On Wednesday at 12:30pm the organisers of the Positively Red
SHAG Week arranged themselves into the shape of an AIDS ribbon.
The members of the flash mob were raising awareness about
sexual health, HIV, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
Events have been running since Monday and the week reaches
its culmination tonight with the Sexpression Finale. The Union is
hosting an Ann Summers party in the Union Dining Hall for ladies
and there will be a Pole Dancing show in dB’s for the men.

New Visa system: Students absent for more than 14 days should
be reported to the Home Office within 5 working days
Universities could be forced to imple-
ment draconian monitoring of all stu-
dents’ attendance under the Govern-
ment’s newly proposed immigration
system. Within the next 18 months
students may have to register their
presence at each lecture, in order to
ensure that college is fully aware of
their movements.
Under the Home Office’s new
“Points Based System” (PBS) of im-
migration, international students will
be “Sponsored” by their educational
institution in order to receive a visa, in
a bid to eliminate the fraudulent use of
student visas as an immigration “back
door.” The “Sponsor” (in this case, the
University) must be accredited by an
approved body, and has several duties:
one of which is to report students who
do not attend their course, and those
who fail to register.
According to the proposed rules for
“Tier 4” of the system (the section that
applies to students), if an international
student is absent for 14 days the Uni-
versity must report this to the Home
Office within 5 working days. If they
fail to do this, their “Accredited Spon-
sor” status may be revoked, immedi-
ately invalidating all visas that they
sponsor.
In many courses at Imperial, failure
of a single student to attend for two
weeks would be easily overlooked in a
class with hundreds of students, espe-
cially if there is little laboratory work.
A registration of international students
at seminars, tutorials and even lectures
could be the only way of ensuring that
absencesarenoticed.However,singling
out only the international students for
such treatment would undoubtedly
be met with some protest. Indeed, an
internal paper from the University
of Edinburgh on the subject feared
that “intrusive attendance monitoring
which [the University] believe would
have to apply to all students to avoid
falling foul of the Race Relations Act,”
which is an interpretation also voiced
by sources at Imperial College.
The PBS is one of several new meas-
ures designed to combat immigration
and terrorism issues in education, with
the Academic Technology Approval
Scheme (ATAS) recently started ear-
lier this month. The ATAS system is
designed as a register of foreign na-
tional postgraduates who are studying
courses in technologies that could be
used in weapons of mass destruction
and terrorism (most of which are of-
fered by Imperial); requiring students
to apply with their course and personal
details before being allowed a visa, in
order to prevent the dissemination of
“sensitive” expertise.
The Government is keen to be seen
addressing the issues of security and
immigration after recent political de-
bacles, but questions are being asked
over the practicalities of the reformed
systems, and universities across the
country are pushing for changes to the
plan.
Whilst the PBS was well-received by
institutions on announcement, debate
over the details is likely to continue
as the system does not become active
until early 2009. Many universities are
concerned about the legal implications
of their “Sponsor” status, and have a
difficult task in finding how to strike a
balance between applying the controls
imposed on them by the Home Office,
and allowing students the freedom that
they demand.
Did you miss this Quantum Mechanics lecture yesterday? The College
might be forced to keep a check on you in the future
