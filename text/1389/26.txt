“I opened up Mario Galaxy expect-
ing a fun and playable gimmick.
What I found was Mario 64 v2.0
- refined, updated and altogether
brilliant. Gameplay is top-notch,
and while the graphics look out-
dated and the camera is confus-
ing, the game is more fun and
addictive than almost anything on
the shelves.”

“About as good as waking up to a
full English fryup - and I don’t get
those too often!”
- Jimmy Allison, 3rd Year,

“As a Mario game, it’s exactly what
you expect. I like how they use the
Wii remote controls.”
- Ben Allison, 2nd Year, ELit
“It’s got sublime controls and
outstanding gameplay. We got
that 10 [ten] years ago with Super
Mario 64, though. What really
makes Galaxy special is gravity.
It is handled so well it becomes a
game onto itself.”
- Eduardo Vasquez-Silva, 3rd
Year, EEEng
“It’s the kind of game where your
time spent with it is never long
enough.”
- Barett Dulguerian, 1st Year,
EEEng
“SMG has such an expansive
variety of enviroments to explore
that it takes a bit to get used to
its style, like gravity suddenly
changing its mind on which di-
rection it wants to take you. But
once it all clicks its really a lot of
fun and Nintendo have out done
themelves again with the usage of
the wiimote and nunchuck.”

Review
S
uper Mario 64 set the bar for
3D platformers and when
Super Mario Sunshine came
along the weight of expecta-
tion was too much for the
title to bear ultimately leading to it
buckling underneath its own FLUDD
cannon. Whereas Mario 64 was a les-
son in purist platforming with its sat-
isfying triple jumps, wall-jumps and
long jumps, Sunshine took the empha-
sis away from its central character and
shifted the action towards a stupidly
named hose. Manoeuvring Sunshine’s
worlds was more about hovering
awkwardly across gaps and collect-
ing Shines which inevitably involved
spraying water over some brown gunk.
It literally became a case of rinse and
repeat.
As you can probably tell, I wasn’t
exactly enamoured with Nintendo’s ef-
fort during the Gamecube’s generation.
A little part of me died inside when
I defeated Bowser and subsequently
couldn’t be arsed to collect the col-
lect the remaining stars. I refuse to call
them Shines out of principle, in case
you were wondering. Sunshine left me
cold; I felt like an England fan who’d
just watched their country crash out
of the Euro Championships qualifying
stage in the knowledge that it would be
at least three years before their next fix
of international football fever.
Thankfully my gaming hiatus has
passed and Super Mario Galaxy is
here, finally. In some senses it is as
much of a step backwards as it is for-
wards: stars are stars once again, Mario
is required to rely on his own legs and
you no longer have to collect coins like
an OCD sufferer in order to get all
120 stars within the game. Nintendo
have listened to the mixed reception
Sunshine received and returned to the
core game play elements that made
Mario 64 such an addictive title. Most
successfully of all, Galaxy has retained
that just-one-more-star feel that Mario
64 nailed so perfectly.
Collecting each star is a mini-ad-
venture in Galaxy. Your base camp
for adventures is the Comet Observa-
tory and located on it are a number of
Domes which house Launch Stars that
shoot you on your way to the various
galaxies. Mario soars into each galaxy
like Superman/Neo – depending on
your level of geekdom – and somer-
saults with a flourish announcing his
arrival and the start of his star hunting
mini-adventure. Collecting a star takes
5 to 20 minutes and finding each one
is like being administered with a sa-
line solution of happiness. You share
Mario’s glee as he grabs each golden
star because the journey get-
ting there is such an
enjoyable one.
Galaxies
are in-
credibly
diverse.
They
range in
sizes with some
that contain single
stars whilst the main lev-
els house 4 or 5. Most galaxies con-
tain a series of planets for Mario to
fly between. These planets range from
spherical bodies to twisting, spiral-
ling platforms to more conventional
worlds that Mario can wander around
to insane levels made purely of blocks
that don’t resemble planets at all. The
whole galactic set up is just an excuse
for Nintendo to create what appear to
be mind-bendingly complex levels. Of-
ten the star you’re after will be located
on the other side of the galaxy and the
inexperienced could be forgiven for
wondering how in Zeus’ name you’re
supposed to get the stars, but as you
get used to the universe Mario finds
himself in, you learn and begin to ap-
preciate Miyamoto’s Special Relativity
and Advanced Nintendo Mechanics.
You learn which planets will allow you
to jump with their curvature, which
ones you’ll fall off if you take a step over
the edge, which ones you can
run around in all direc-
tions and whether
it’s possible
to jump
into the
OMG, it’s SMG!

tional pull

Travelling between the planets makes
the galaxies appear deceptively large
too; it’s difficult to tell how vast the
levels are in comparison to Mario 64
but there is an enormous sense of scale
as you fly through space. Often when
you’re propelled from a Launch Star
you’re rewarded with a glorious over-
view of the entire potential play area
and you soon become eager to venture
to every corner of each galaxy.

Riposte
Interplanetary space hopping is a
significantly ingenious addition to the
platforming genre such that Galaxy
doesn’t ever feel stale, although else-
where the game remains faithful to its
prequels. The mantra: “if it ain’t broke,
tweak it,” definitely applies here. Mario
now spin attacks rather than punching
and he has had his health bar chopped
in half meaning he can only suffer
three blows before death; a welcome
change which makes the game mildly
more difficult. Some methods for col-
lecting stars remain familiar includ-
ing bopping bosses three times on the
weak spot, racing penguins and catch-
ing bunny rabbits, however the newly
introduced mushroom power-ups
(including Bee, Boo, Ice and Spring
Mario) bring welcome variety along
with plenty of innovatively designed
levels you wouldn’t find in the previous
games.
Whilst Mario’s latest outing is nigh-
on perfect, there are a few issues worth
raising. Firstly, Galaxy is somehow
more linear than the previous games.
It has retained Sunshine’s awful fea-
ture where a cut-scene showed you the
path to a star just before you entered
a level, thus softening the adventure
element slightly. This can be avoided
easily enough by just looking at your
crotch… er, away from the screen.
However, whereas Mario 64 gave you
a set of sandpits to explore, collect-
ing stars in whichever order you liked,
Galaxy more or less forces you to find
its stars in a given order. The worlds
change depending on which star you
opt to go in search of, meaning that
you don’t get the satisfaction of locat-
ing a star just from clue in its title.
Galaxy richly deserves its current
lofty number two status on the games-
rankings.com all time Top 10. Mario
64 was praised for bringing platform
games successfully into three dimen-
sions and whilst this was no mean feat,
it was almost inevitable that Nintendo
or someone else would do it eventually.
Building a cart is easy, but reinventing
the wheel is far more difficult and sec-
ond time round Nintendo has succeed-
ed with aplomb.
