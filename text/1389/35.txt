felix needs you!
Felix is written by students for
students. We need your contributions
so that we can report on news stories
and keep everybody entertained
during the most arduous of lectures.
Felix is actively recruiting again now the holidays are
almost upon us. In preparation for next term we are
specifically looking for:
Webmasters
• to upload issues and articles to the
website (union.ic.ac.uk/felix at the moment!)
News writers
• to report on anything that affects
students at Imperial
Feature writers
• to research and create unique
articles
Comment columnists
• to join in with the current
crop of opinionated writers
Contributors for all the sections
• or writers keen on
joining in with more than one section
Copy editors
• with an eagle-eye for grammer
mistakes to form part of our crack team
If you’ve emailed in the past and I’ve not responded,
that’s because I’m a dunce. Feel free to drop me
another email and hopefully I’ll reply this time! The
address to send to is felix@imperial.ac.uk
