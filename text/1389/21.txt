Herzog, beyond the fiction
There must be something about the
jungle that appeals to Werner Her-
zog. The eccentricity of his character
matched with the extremity of the sur-
rounding he has returned to time and
time again show up (debatably) his
best fictional work. In fact, had it not
been for his two Amazon-based tales,
Aguirre, Wrath of God and Fitzcar-
raldo, the legend of Werner Herzog
would not be nearly as far-fetched as it
currently stands.
If ever fear and awe went hand in
hand, it is probably the moment at
which an agent tells their actor that
Herzog has been on the phone. The
New German Cinema alumnus has a
reputation for authenticity beyond the
call of duty that would make anyone on
the other end of the line hesitate. The
long time recipient of Herzog’s tirades,
Klaus Kinski, would certainly testify to
the sadistic tendencies of the auteur.
Aguirre, the first of five collabora-
tions between the two, saw the director
take his crew rafting down the Amazon
under such deprived conditions that
Kinski threatened to walk out, at which
point Herzog threatened to shoot him
on the spot. Thankfully for both of
their reputations, which were
then only in the process of
being formed, Kinski
knew when he was
beaten and decided
to stay. I’ll bet the

A
mongst the vitriolic spir-
it that Felix has acquired
of late, I have found my
perfectly content exist-
ence to be unnervingly
pleasant. The sun has set on the sum-
mer of shit cinema and the festival lead
the way in consecrating the aisles of
the multiplex once more to the point
that I have been criticised (yes, me!)
of being overly generous with reviews.
Well fuck you, but after sitting through
three months of shite during the holi-
days, when I actually have time to
make the most of my unlimited pass,
half-hearted fare like Lions for Lambs
is enough to leave a small wet patch
on the cinema seat by the time the 3rd

But, hoorah, just when you think life
is beautiful again, something worse
than even Pirates of the Carribean XVII
lands in your lap and you realise what
is wrong with this false consciousness
you have conjured: bloody gangsters.
Not in the sense that they will get my
kids hooked on heroin or mow down
my business with an uzi, but that they’ll
spend a good three hours boring me to
death. A cunning plan indeed.
Ridley Scott, where did it all go
wrong? Perhaps two decades of Blade
Runner bashing got to him before he
got the chance to release his own mas-
terpiece edit of the classic and it seems
that, since then, he just falls at every
hurdle. Hannibal, Kingdom of Heav-
en and A Good Year didn’t exactly set
the world alight and God knows why
Gladiator did. Now he delivers Ameri-
can Gangster and there’s a good buzz
stonger than the average Rampant
Rabbit. Bizarrely, this seems to always
be the case for these mobster stories.
Gangster films formulaically provide
20 minutes of weak orgasmic release
during a final shootout fluffed up with
almost three hours of robotic foreplay
and a five minute denouement reminis-
cent of those fresher Sunday mornings
with the beer-goggled/badly-judged/
ill-remembered pull that beggars the
question “Why did I do this again?”.
I say formulaic, I mean pretty much
identical.
Let’s throw in large family with a slice
of Shakespearean betrayal, dress up a
pretty lady to be the hard done-by moll,
sprinkle with a generous helping of
crack or smack and then inject a down-
pour of bullets. Horror films at least
try and put a spin on their checklists
in the postmodern age that Wes Cra-
ven’s Scream heralded. Yet it is crime
cinema that seems to hold the ultimate
respect for critics everywhere.
For those who hold The Godfather
(and more disappointingly the sequel)
sacred, get over it. Even Coppolla him-
self wasn’t a fan and did it for influence
over taste. Scorsese took it to the next
level and made it even more formu-
laic by casting DeNiro in every single
one, until he got too old and booted
for Leo. Now Scott has been caught
in the crossfire, but hell, he put himself
there.
Don’t let that put you off though,
everyone else loves it, including our

complain.
wilderness, voyaging over land and
water to find the lost golden city of El
Dorado. The likely guess is that it was
only the success and quality of Aguirre
that convinced Kinski to return to the
Amazon for Fitzcarraldo, his operatic
epic for which conventional shooting
would have to be completely assuaged.
Fitzcarraldo is possibly as much of
a self-portrait as Hitchcock created in
Vertigo, a vivid recreation of Herzog’s
drive and determination embodied by
Kinski in the titular role. Fitz is a man
so committed to his love of opera that,
in order to fund the building of an op-
era house in his remote Peruvian town,
he buys a stretch of river to exploit in
the rapidly expanding turn-of-the-cen-
tury rubber industry, the only problem
being the rapids between his stretch
and the preferred final destination. But
that’s not a problem when you rope in a
few natives and your crew to haul your
steamship over a mountain instead.
The now notorious task of moving
the behemoth ship has gone down in
movie history for scale of ambition.
Not a single special effect was used
as Kinski watches his ship get pulled
out of the river and hauled over the
slight obstacle. It does provide wonder

it was achieved; for

Rescue Dawn sees
Christian Bale bravely
take on the impressive
mantle, and it seems that
Herzog hasn’t lost his
touch for the dramat-
ic. In true Bear Grylls
style,theHollywood

move that
would
surely have made Ben Affleck throw
himself under the next steamship
Herzog had ploughing through the
rainforest.
For many people however, the name
Werner Herzog will be synonymous
with documentary (e.g. Grizzly Man)
rather than these jungle tales of fiction.
The truth is that Herzog is a support-
er of the authentic above all else. His
methods have, possibly, overshadowed
the quality of his actual work, but how
great is it to have someone whose off-
screen persona generates just as many
great stories as their films can tell? The
same couldn’t be said of Steven Spiel-
berg or Michael Mann.
Still, had Hitchcock been around on
the scene, it’s hard to believe he would
refrain from using his immortal catch-
phrase: “It’s only a movie”. The differ-
ence is, for Herzog, it’s much more.

Rescue Dawn ★★✫✫✫
Director: Werner Herzog
Writer: Werner Herzog
Cast: Christian Bale
Steve Zahn
Rescue Dawn is as much a testimony
to Herzog’s continued penchant for
authenticity as it is a lament to his
storytelling abilities of years gone by.
The truth is that Herzog never made
‘enjoyable’ films in the strictest sense of
the word; his work in the seventies and
eighties was full of character (not least
due to the repeated appearance of the
colourful Kinski), the works of a man
with something to put right without
the luxuries or complacencies of a sim-
plistic story. With Rescue Dawn how-
ever, Herzog has found a state of limbo
between documentary and a story-
propelling narrative, leaving both sides
sadly short.
It perhaps seems folly to judge a Her-
zog film on its watchability when his
films, even compared against those
of his New German Cinema contem-
poraries, had a habit of dragging their
heels in sobriety on way to narrative
thrust. The critical themes of this cine-
ma that pulled it into the international
arena and brought it onto the tip of
a new creative wave are lost in the
jungle of Rescue Dawn.
The opening CGI plane crash is,
perhaps, the first hint that the studi-
os might have tampered with Herzog’s
initial vision of this story, sending any
of his biting social commentary into a
nosedive. Much more likely, however,
is Herzog’s recent immersion in docu-
mentary. Even Rescue is based on his
documentary of 10 years ago, Little Di-
eter Needs to Fly, in which he took the
Vietnam escapee back to the Laotian
jungle where he was held captive fol-
lowing a crash on his debut flight.
Rescue is the story of his capture and
escape, but manages to avoid being
overly critical of either side in the con-
flict. Instead of criticising the powers
that be, this could be the story of one
man’s struggle to overcome adversity,
and while this is primarily what the film
focuses on, the character work done on
Dieter seems slightly sketchy even with
Christian Bale in the lead role.
Bale is one of the worlds best job-
bing actors today and certainly one of
the most interesting. Beguiling in the
whole spectrum from Patrick Bateman
or Batman, action man or actor man,
few Hollywood stars could have, or
would have, coped with the demanding
Herzog. His dedication may know no
bounds but he doesn’t seem stretched
enough here for any length of time.
Ultimately, Herzog seems to have
forgotten the truth that a story, not just
documentaries, can tell, and so Rescue
can be tough going. No surprise there
then, but without the redeeming com-
mentary to salvage from the wreckage
it is just short of going up in flames.
You sure you don’t want to eat the snake too? Why?
