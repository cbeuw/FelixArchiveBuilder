Virgo
You will wake up
tomorrow morning
having four orgasms
simultaneously. If
you are a girl, this is
a very good thing. If
you are a boy, this will be extremely messy. But
still rather good. You will then get out your
massive huge brutal vibrator only to discover
that it has run out of batteries. Damn... what
an unfortunate mess. I think you had better
wash your sheets.
Scorpio

office in the West
Basement every
Thursday morning at 2am where we sing-a-
long to Jacko’s classics. Don’t forget: Earth
Song Hour follows immediately at 3am!
WHAT ABOUT US?!
Sagittarius
I tend to find that
my boyfriend’s penis
is too large to have
anal sex comfort-
ably. I have shared
this information
with you as it is SHAG week and we are all
supposed to be more open about sex. Have I
shared too much information? If anyone is of-
fended then I suggest that you go out and get a
life. Or a screw. Or maybe both. But don’t get
chlamydia or genital warts. Itch.. itch..
Capricorn
This weeks
horoscopes horribly
punctuated whichs
rather unfortunate
because its quite
likely to frustrate a
few of the larger pedants out there amongst
yall Youre all going to have to put up with this
slack use of the English language until I fix my
keyboard OK
Cancer
Oops... I forgot to
do the horoscope
above and now
there’s just a white
space titled “fill”. Do
you think anyone
will notice? In some senses, it quite cool really.
The reader gets to see the journalist’s creation
in progress as he plans his work and thinks
how he can cut corners to meet deadlines.
Gemini
fill
Leo
Once again, your
eyes are bleeding
having stared at the
computer screen for
far too long. In fact,
this week you don’t
even kip on the sofa, you just keep on going
like those pink, fluffy bunnies wot have batter-
ies in them. Are you going to burn out by the
time you hit 25? Perhaps you’ll just have a mild
stroke and no one will be there to save you
since you’re all alone in your office. Am cry.
Taurus
If Bob has seven
hats and Jill has
twelve, Nigel has six
bananas and Bob
has two bananas,
Jill has eight lemon
cheesecakes, Dangerous Dave has four lemon
cheesecakes and Bob has eighty-eight lemon
cheesecakes – how many time can a mango
be swung round a palm tree by a killer whale
before it’s engulfed in flames from Dastardly
Dan’s bunsen burner?
Aries
You are one of those
people who presses
the button for the
bus to stop even
though the button
has already been
pressed and the sign saying “STOPPING” is
already glowing. This means you are a loser,
because you either can’t read or think you are
more important that the last person. Moron.
Pisces
This week you
venture to Burton’s
menswear on Liv-
erbaker Street. It’s a
really hip, happen-
ing and downright
funky place, don’t you know? I once got lost in
the jacket pocket of one of their suits. Funnily
enough I met a shoe from Marks & Spencers
there. He was a left one in case you were won-
dering. Said he was on his way to Debenhams
and got stuck? Dunno what that was about.

Chickety China the
Chinese chicken,
you have a drum-
stick and your brain
stops tickin’. Watch-
ing X-files no lights
on, we’re dans la maison, I hope the Smoking
Mans’ in this one. Like Harrison Ford I’m get-
ting frantic, like Sting I’m tantric, like Snick-
ers, guaranteed to satisfy. How can I help it if
I think you’re funny when I think you’re mad.
Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad.

How to rate yourself:
Under 8 words: If ignorance is bliss, you
must be orgasmic.
8 - 13 words: Your verbosity is exceeded
only by your stupidity. If brains were rain,
you’d be a desert.
14 - 19 words: You’re not as stupid as you
look, are you?
20 plus words: Well done, oh you of
wordy wonderment!
Last week’s solution:
The seven letter word was:
MONARCH
Congratulations if you have phobias.
Other words included:
acom, anchor, carom, chroma, coma,
corm, corn, hoar, horn, macho, macon,
macro, macron, manor, moan, mocha,
mohr, moram morn, nacho, norm, orach,
orca, racon, roach, roam, roan
How to play
Using the letters given, not more than
once, make as many words as possible.
They must be at least four or more let-
ters long and each word you come up with
must include the central letter. Capitalised
words, conjugated verbs (past tense etc),
adverbs ending in “-ly”, comparatives and
superlatives are disallowed. A word you
are not allowed in this case would be “Fe-
lix” as none of the letters can be found in
the polygon. I think you know the rules by
now.
