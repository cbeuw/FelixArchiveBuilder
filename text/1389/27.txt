The journey begins with our
hero - the infallible, indomitable
Mario. Not surprisingly, Mario
Mario (yes, that’s his surname,
too) began his life as Jumpman,
fighting against the evil, anthro-
poidic reign of Donkey Kong.
It wasn’t long till he was chris-
tened Mario and began the
Sisyphean task of rescuing one
Princess Peach, who, being the
full-blood Princess she is, lives to
be kidnapped.
The world-famous Italian
plumber resides in Mushroom
Kingdom - which is always on
the cusp of being subjugated by
the reptilian Bowser.
After countless adventures -
not all of them a platforming epic
- Mario has become a beacon of
light for airy Princesses and gam-
ers the world over.
I mean, how can you not like
this tubby little Italian plumber?
Once citizens of the peace-
ful Mushroom Kingdom,
the iconic Goombas
are one of the most
common enemies that Mario
faces on his quest to rescue
Princess Peach.
There’s nothing more satisfy-
ing than the ‘pop’ sound emit-
ted from a Goomba squashed
underMario’slarge,
rubber boots.
There is no name in all of
videogaming that can claim
as much ubiquity and perhaps,
popularity, as Mario.
Mario has been around for
many years now and has ap-
peared in an astonishing number
of videogames spanning myriad
genres. However, the gaming
populace will have defined Mario
by his platforming roots: namely
the Super Mario Brothers and
Super Mario World series’ on the
legacy consoles. Similarly, Mario
64 took the gaming world by
storm as a the perfect successor
to the Marios of yore. Surpris-
ingly, there hasn’t been a Mario
game generating as much fer-
vent brouhaha since then. And
not without good reason since
the aforementioned games have
since become the paradigmatic
representatives of their respec-
tive areas of expertise. Countless
platformers often owe much to
this Italian plumber.
Super Mario Sunshine appar-
ently set (pun intended) into
the winter of discontent for fans
everywhere. It was supposed to
have been the heir to Mario 64’s
throne but it was nothing more
than a false prophet to many.
Despite this disappointment,
little has dissuaded gamers from
looking up to the jovial handy-
man as their beacon and messiah.
He hasn’t been immune to dubi-
ous decisions in the past as well,
including a less than stellar sub-
sidiary games and an absolutely
appalling live action film. When
someone less than ten years old
can call a movie ‘bad’, then clearly
someone needs to be shot.
But that’s pretty much the past
at this stage. Against all the odds
pushed forth by naysayers, the
Wii has become a bastion of suc-
cess for Nintendo - it’s a lovable
piece of hardware that can do no
wrong. With everything going
for it, can the Wii go where the
Gamecube failed to reach? Can
we get our true Mario and not
just another offshoot? In a true
‘the Princess is another castle’
fashion, gamers have been hop-
ping from report to report upon
bated breath and all to answer
one question: is this the one?
The answer is simple: it’s
Mario.
Super Mario Sunshine (Gamecube)
It’s no coincidence that Sunshine finds itself sixty-feet under. Under the
ocean, that is. Somehow Nintendo managed to make the camera controls
even worse than in 64. Combine this with invisible walls between islands
and an infuriating group of inhabitants that you’d take great pleasure from
launching into the Sun, and you have a recipe for disaster. Ok, so perhaps it’s
not that bad... Nah, who am I kidding?
Super Mario World (SNES)
What made is stand out for me was
when my cousin actually asked her
dad to buy her the game. She was
in University. In 2003. That’s when
I realised that Super Mario World
doesn’t just evoke special memo-
ries in gamers, but it does so for
anyone who has played it. And why
not? The gameplay is sweet, simple
and addicting and the music is ab-
solutely unforgettable. Take away
the fancy graphics and orchestral
scores and strip them down to their
cores and you’ll realise that most
games are trying to be Mario, if not
directly but in spirit.
