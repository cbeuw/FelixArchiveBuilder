Album of The Week
Neil Young
Le Noise
Reprise Records
2010
Subtle beauty with gentle guitaring: themes this
modern masterpiece epitomises as Neil Young de-
livers some of the best material he has written in
the last decade. Experimentally manipulating the
abilities of one man and a guitar to form wonder-
fully edgy riffs that weave their way, dissonantly,
around the powerful lyrics, Young comes across as
the emotionally dedicated activist he is. The album
is very much a quiet affair despite the anger-fuelled,
feedback-drenched guitaring that takes you by sur-
prise. Young keeps it solitary, like listening to a man
letting go of his inner torment. There is no feeling
of forced production and the stripped back manner
keeps the music fresh every time I listen to it. It is
produced by mastermind Daniel Lanois, who brings
out the addictive effects but toys with repetition.
Overall, this is a wonderfully intimate piece of work
that brings you one-on-one with Neil Young.

Diagram of the Heart have a
heart-to-heart before Bestival
At the heart of Imperial
on the weekend, all
diagrams were out of
mind save the endlessly
energetic Diagram of
the Heart. They shared
their love of ginger-nut
biscuits before playing
Bestival this summer
A
small band with big sounds, they
are a London-based electronic
duo who have enough energy
to outrun the energizer bunny.
They’re on the road to be quite
the big deal. Here’s what Kye and Anthony
had to say before they performed at Bestival
this summer.
Diagram of the Heart is quite an exquisite
name, are you guys all really into biology?
Yeah, we were both doctors. Only joking
we weren’t. We got to a stage where we had
written god knows how many songs, and we
thought we ought to get a name. Diagram of
the Heart resembled what we were about and
our music having one foot in the club and a
driving heartbeat.
You are signed up to Deconstruction Re-
cords. Was that something you were aiming
for seeing as they are a dance style label?
It was a very natural thing, one of the first
people we spoke to was Mike Pickering from
Sony and it was just a very natural and perfect
time for us, as they’re all about having one
foot in the charts and at the same time being
very much in the club scene.
I think what’s exciting for Kye and I is hav-
ing signed to Colombia, we were given the op-
portunity to work, along with Mike Pickering,
Hacienda DJ and the lead man of M-People,
with deconstruction records which was fan-
tastic.
If you could choose a musician, DJ or
anyone to jam onstage with, who would
your ideal artist be?
We both really love Faithless and we actu-
ally have a song on our album that we would
love to have Maxi Jazz on. We have a song
called ‘Tell Suburbia’, which is about 9-10
minutes long, it’s epic, and we’ve always
thought Maxi Jazz would just be perfect.
I’d love to see Noel Gallagher up on stage
playing guitar with us, which would be pret-
ty mental, just because we have that mix of
styles within what we do and we both have
Key info
Top song: ‘Dead Famous’. An infec-
tiously catchy, shout-out-loud, anthe-
mic pop song, with synths powerful
enough to shake bones and walls
alike.
Next in London: Sunday, 31st Oc-
tober – Freeze Festival @ Battersea
Power Station.

different influences so it’s a mix of dance
music with pop music. There’s also a lot of
influences from people like Kasabian and
Oasis.
Seeing as you have a foot in both camps,
one being dance music and the other a more
indie style, where would you prefer playing,
in a large arena/rave or a tight knit indie
venue?
For us it’s not so much the venue but the
people, I think our music is for people who
want to go out and have a really good time
and just jump up and down and go mad; we’re
about escaping and letting go and thowing
your hands in the air. That can work anywhere
whether it’s a little bar or a big festival.
What’s your favourite type of biscuit?
Rich tea or ginger
What in your opinion is the best hangover
cure?
A fry-up or a strawberry milkshake
If you could go back to one day in history,
when would you visit?
Woodstock, I’d love that.
What can people expect from a Diagram
of the Heart gig?
Full energy, full power and a good time,
that’s what we’re about.
You’ve been touring around plenty re-
cently so where would you say the best
place you’ve played is?
For me personally it was Ibiza Rocks; it was
amazing to be up there and I’m a big fan of
Calvin Harris as well, so it was amazing to
support him and the crowd was just unbeliev-
able, it was completely packed.
There have been loads of really good ones
like when we supported the Scissor Sisters in
Manchester, there were 4,000 people and that
was wicked.
What do you think the near future holds
for you guys?
Hopefully more of the same, we’ve had an
amazing summer, a summer that for people
who play music is a dream. I just hope it con-
tinues and there’s no reason why it shouldn’t.
To wrap it up, what would you say to mu-
sicians out there who dig what you’re about
and want to do the same?
I know it sounds cheesy but I’d say never
give up, I think that’s the best advice anyone
could give you. We write our music together
but we’ve been working hard individually and
that has brought us two together. I don’t think
even the most successful musicians in the
world would say its easy... It’s a roller-coaster,
you’ve got to hold on tight. Luckily we have
each other and we’re really good friends.
