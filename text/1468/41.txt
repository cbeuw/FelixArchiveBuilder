The drum show in Osaka after the game
ful translation of the maps, I decided to
ignore the fact that there was a subway
station opposite our hostel and claimed
that 400m was not that much of a walk...
after 1.2km and with 20kg of luggage in
wheelie bags that didn’t really work, we
realised that we probably should have
listened to Hugh! At times, it was defi-
nitely Hugh who was leading this wan-
dering group of foreigners, or gaijin as
we were referred to in the streets!
Our first two games in Tokyo were
both at the Tokyo University Komaba
campus; the first fixture was against Yo-
kohama Country and Athletic Club - an
ex-pat team - for the 2nd XV, whilst the
1st XV played Tokyo University, who
it turns out had spoken to Kyoto and
brought in some alumni players from
the last decade to bolster their side. This
was not going to be a good day
for Ninja’s, as ill-discipline and lack
of composure set in, with three yellow
cards being brandished for the game
against Tokyo, the first of which was for
the Tokyo flanker straight after the kick-
off. The Barbarians had a rare luxury
for their game, an English referee who
played Northern Hemisphere rugby.
This meant that scrums were straight
and rapid for a change! After a shaky
start, which saw Richard ‘Chumble’ Si-
mons summersault after jumping into a
tackle, the Barbarians found their feet
and put together some good phases,
however, their fitness gave way and Yo-
kohama went on to win the game.
Three days later, the 2nd XV had their
last game of tour against Kokushikan
University, however, despite their best
efforts, were unable to win the game, but
were able to come away with some
excellent presents.
Whilst in Tokyo, the Club made a trip
to Mount Fuji, determined to reach the
summit and make it back to the hostel
all in one day. After several warnings
from locals about the cold and altitude
sickness, the touring party set off on
the eight hour climb, but as the hours
went on, the numbers climbing began
to dwindle and in the end, only a few
made it to the summit. One of the tour-
ing party members even managed to
reach the summit and make it back to
the bus station in five hours, a remark-
able achievement!
After spending a week in Tokyo, the
touring party made its way to the final
destination of Osaka, where the 1st XV
would play Osaka Uni- versity
o f
Health and Sports Science. The game
was very tough and demanding on the
players, and at half time, Imperial were
narrowly losing 14-5, however, their
superior fitness showed and Osaka
went on to win the game 61-5. After the
game, we were yet again blown away
with the Japanese hospitality, not only
were we given a commemorative t-shirt
each, but they also presented the Club
with a Samurai helmet, a present that
will definitely have to reside behind a
glass cabinet! If that was not enough,
they also organised a mesmerizing Japa-
nese Drum performance, where we were
even allowed a go to create our
own beat, how- ever, it
definitely lacked
any sort of tune!
The tour was exciting, it was exhila-
rating and it was exhausting, but it was
an experience that the players will never
forget, and it would not have been pos-
sible without the generous support from
Sport Imperial and the Old Centralians’
Trust.
A big
thank you
to you all.
Oh, and one
more thing,
I motherfucking
heart the J-
Pan!*
