BUSINESS
Imperial students storm the City
The College was well represented, with students interning at every major corpora-
tion and business area. Students share their views on the summer internships below
work other people do. Sit with them, ask
them questions. Obviously be intelligent
in the way that you approach anyone and
always use common sense, but people
usually like talking about their job, pro-
vided you pick the right moment. It is
the only you way you can find out if you
will be happy in any job or in any in-
dustry. Be aware that there is no shame
in realising you do not actually like the
industry, the culture or the work. Not ev-
eryone wants to work 80+ hour weeks in
an extremely competitive environment.
You are better off coming to this reali-
sation during the internship when there
is time left to figure out alternatives for
when you graduate, than starting a full-
time job you really hate.
Something many internship appli-
cants also fail to conceptualise is that
cultural and personal fit is extremely
important, and the reason there are so
many interviews. Whoever employs
you will be spending more time around
you than their own family, so build-
ing a personal rapport is of utmost
importance. It is imperative that you
like the firm and the firm likes you.
If this doesn’t happen, things can turn
sour very easily. When recruiters men-
tion culture, we tend to think it is just
a buzzword, but after spending a long
summer interning, you will see that this
is rarely the case.
It is only the first issue of the year, but
already time is wearing thin. For most
firms, it absolutely pays off to apply
earlier rather than later, as a lot of firms
offer places on a rolling basis. With this
in mind, make sure you attend the Ca-
reers Fair happening 27th October on
the Queen’s Lawn Marquee - there will
be dozens of employers from whom you
will be able to get a really fantastic in-
sight into companies, provided you ask
the right questions. It’s also a great place
to start selling yourself to companies that
you know you are already interested in.
Just make sure you leave hubris at home.
Get applying now and most impo-
rantly remember the following winning
cocktail of characteristics in anything
you do: be personable, be hungry, be in-
telligent and be humble.

Credit Suisse
I admit I was slightly appre-
hensive before joining Credit
Suisse as a Summer Ana-
lyst. Despite having a strong
background in technology,
the financial industry can first
seem intimidating to many.
Fortunately, my team in Credit
Suisse instantly made me
feel comfortable and showed
me around the firm, introduc-
ing me to the many different
teams. I began to realise that
learning about the role was
somewhat less important
than general exposure to the
bank, and I managed to learn
a wide variety of skills. After
what were 10 thoroughly enjoy-
able weeks. I was finally sad to
leave, but will keep in touch
with my colleagues until I re-
turn to the team in July next
year.

Barclays Capital
I joined Barclays Capital in
commodities and was ex-
tremely happy with the asset
class. There is no doubt that
this internship has solidified
my desire to work in the in-
dustry. Barcap operates an ex-
tremely well thought out objec-
tives programme throughout
the summer. One of the objec-
tives, and perhaps one of the
best things about the entire
internship, was to meet with a
minimum of 3 managing direc-
tors and 7 directors. It goes
to show how approachable ev-
eryone at the firm is and how
willing they are to share the
experience that has led them
to where they are today. I am
fortunate to be able to return
to Barcap next summer and I
am really looking forward to it.

Ernst & Young
I interned at Ernst & Young in
their advisory division. Its cli-
ent base is quite impressive
and it’s common for graduates
to gain experience with com-
panies like BP, Barclays and
Apple in their first year. The in-
ternship program holds an in-
duction week during which we
were even given free accommo-
dation. I then was introduced
to my division and assigned to
my first client. To ensure I got
the most out of the experience
E&Y rotated me through a new
client each week, allowing me
to gain experience with differ-
ent companies. The internship
was amazing; everyone was
super laid back and seemed
to genuinely enjoy their job. I’d
recommend applying to E&Y if
you have the opportunity.
Be sure to attend the Careers Fair on the 27th of October on the Queen’s
Lawn. And try not to stare at the company representative’s lips either...

applicants fail to

Research Lab, Germany
Last summer instead of going
to a bank like most my friends
I interned at a research lab in
Germany. The program was
funded by the German Ex-
change body, DAAD, and was
a summer I will never forget.
It was great to get first hand
experience of working in a re-
search lab and actually use
the skills I have learnt in the
chemistry lab while at Imperial.
On top of that I got the oppor-
tunity to live in another country
in probably the coolest city in
Europe and immerse myself in
a completely new culture and
environment.
The experience definitely
adds something to my CV,
which is something that will
make me stand out to my fu-
ture employers.

Deutsche Bank
I interned at Deutsche Bank
in the technology division,
aligned with the distressed
credit desk. The wake of the
recession made this area
particularly interesting to be
working in. The role was a non
technical business analyst
role giving me plenty of expo-
sure to the business unit and
communicating with offshore
development teams. The 9
week summer internship gave
invaluable experiance working
in working on real projects and
having to present my reports
to senior stakeholders within
the business. I found the in-
ternship as a whole incredibly
well structured with excellent
support framework, and after
work there was also a good so-
cial life with the other intens.
