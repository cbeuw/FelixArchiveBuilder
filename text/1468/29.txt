Fresh Off The Catwalk:
Trend Report – Spring 2011
Fashion Editor Saskia Verhagen has scoured the catwalks of NY, London, Milan
and Paris to bring you a forecast of what are set to be the biggest hits of next season
Minimalism
Perhaps it’s fallout
from the recession,
or perhaps the fash-
ion world just needed
a dose of no-muss,
no-fuss clean lines
– whatever the case
may be, almost all of
this season’s shows
seemed to have an el-
ement of pared-down
classical purism, and
none more than the
master of keeping it
simple: Calvin Klein.
The luxurious fabrics
and expert cutting did
all the talking, with
acres of silks and
lighter-than-air wool
blends billowing and
sailing down the cat-
walk, unanchored and
unembellished.
The Maxi Skirt
The maxi skirt has
been making attempts
at a comeback for a
few seasons now, but
wearers seem to find
it hard to wear – it
seems to come off as
either too mumsy or
too formal. However,
it seems that the de-
signers this season
have found a solution:
a thigh-high slit. Bring-
ing the maxi bang up-
to-date with an easy
sexiness – flashes of
a perfectly toned legs
were seen in ample
measure at Stella
McCartney whose se-
lection of double-slit
maxis are my pick for
the it-dress of next
Summer.
1970s Rock’n’Roll
Jewel Brights
Although a neutral pal-
ette is set to be huge-
ly popular for next sea-
son, bursts of vibrant
Moroccan jewel tones
were seen splashed
over catwalks, espe-
cially in Milan. The
Italians colour-blocked
their glamorous little
hearts out in vivid
hues of turquoise,
jade, purple, royal
blue and orange, in-
jecting a little joy and
fabulousness into
what seemed to be a
season set for pared-
down simplicity and
the various shades
of white, cream and
oatmeal. Thank good-
ness for Gucci, Fendi
and Prada.
It seems like finally
(finally!) the 1980’s
have reached the end
of their overlong rule
over fashion houses
everywhere. Bringing
a welcome change, el-
ements of the 1970’s
were seen all over the
catwalks: a round,
Lennon-esque pair of
shades here, a flared
trouser there – hints
encompassing all
aspects of the 70’s,
from rock’n’roll Roll-
ing Stones glamour to
hippie-chic Woodstock
bohemia; teddy-boy
rockabillies to Sex Pis-
tols punk-rock rebels,
every 70’s clique had
a place on this sea-
son’s runways.
