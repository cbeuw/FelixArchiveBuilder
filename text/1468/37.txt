PUZZLES
Wordoku
Generic Solution
So, we couldn’t drop the Wordoku
could we? Where else do you get
a PORNFEAST or KNOBJUICE?
Nowhere, that’s where. Well,
expect the usual mix of solely
childish words that will make
you chuckle inside. Wordoku is
identical to Sudoku; we’ve just re-
placed numbers with letters. Com-
plete the puzzle and then send
the whole grid to puzzles.felix@
imperial.ac.uk. You will not get
credit for just the word alone. It’s
not an anagram.

Going underground
This was a great invention from last
year, combining maths, local knowledge
and a great way to waste time into one
easily understandable format. Often in
the past, this game gets cocked up, but
do not despair all will change this year.
It’s an easy one this week.

= 2+1+14+11=28. Job done.
So which London tube station sums to 127?
_ _ _ _
Each letter in the alphabet is assigned a
value, 1-26 (see table) and when added
together for a specific word the sum
equals the total shown. All you have to
do is scan and send the Underground
station that is hidden each week to
puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk

Nonogram
These are Nonograms. They are beyond me,
but some people manage to do them, and bet-
ter still get them correct!
How to play:
Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells in
a grid have to be coloured or left blank accord-
ing to numbers at the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many unbroken
lines or filled-in squares there are in any given
row or column. Look at the solution for help.

Slitherlink
ZOMG. It’s slitherlink y’all. You love it,
your mates love it, even your gran loves
this mental, mind fuck of a puzzle. I’ve
even seen the lecturers do them in their
spare time. No jokes...
If you’ve ever played minesweeper,
then you should be able to understand
this puzzle. The number in each box
represents the number of lines that can
exist around it. Lines can never cross!
In the end, you will end up with a closed
loop. Just have a look at the same in the
next column.

Send your answers to puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk
You’re in your Friday afternoon lecture,
trying to understand how rotors and sta-
tors work. You give up. But wait, what’s
this? An entire page with loads of puz-
zles that you can sink your teeth into to
pass the time. Boredom problem solved.
But you still have to figure out a way of
opening the paper without the lecturer
noticing this. What to do? You realise
that the puzzle page is on the right, so
you can just slide it out with minimal
noise! BOOM! Now to just figure out
how to do the bloody slitherlink...
If you guys do figure these things out,
send us your answers to win points, and
we all know that points mean prizes!
Oh hai
