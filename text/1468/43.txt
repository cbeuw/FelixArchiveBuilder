SPORT
Sport, it’s the same
as war, apart from
all the killing and
stuff... Jovan Nedic
Cryptic Crossword 1,435
A
nother year, another sea-
son and for some bizarre
reason, I am still here!
On top of that, I’m back
doing the same section I
started doing four years ago – well, the
last time I did this section we won paper
of the year, so you never know...
I’ve been at Imperial for so long that
I’ve gone full circle with the calendar
dates. Yes, on this date six years ago I
was hitting daVinci’s and dB’s, what you
guys now call FiveSixEight and Metric
(not that they were open during Fresh-
ers’ Week Welcome Week), for the last
night of Freshers’ Week - which, thanks
to the geniuses in the Union building is
now called Welcome Week. And what
reason do they give for this – ‘oh the
postgraduates feel left out and don’t get
involved as much as the first year stu-
dents’. Of course I fucking don’t, I’ve
already done one freshers’ week and it
was a killer to the liver, why the fuck
would I want to do it again? And on top
of that, I’ve got work to do! But at least
you have got the post-grad Mingle to-
morrow...
Anyway, so by now you have had your
introductory lecture, some of you would
have had a surprise test that you prob-
ably weren’t expecting, but more im-
portantly you went to Freshers’ Fair and
found some clubs and societies to get
involved with. Some of you even had
the excitement of trials on Wednesday
before hitting the Union for your first
Sports Night (again, another thing that
no longer exists!) So what’s next?
Expect a few events to get yourself
better acquainted with the rest of your
team-mates; a Club Captains’ Welcome
Drinks or a Freshers’ Tour somewhere
should do the trick. If all else fails, there
is the ever-dependable ACC bar night
that will definitely ease you in. Soon
enough, you will have learnt about your
team-mates, learnt a few songs to sing in
the bar, and most importantly, you will
have learnt who the old foe is!
Seeing as I am getting on a bit, I hope
you will allow me to impart some wis-
dom and advice to you all. It is through
competition and rivalry that you find
loyalty and a sense of belonging. The
extreme of this is obviously war, with
loyal soldiers fighting to protect their
way of life. Sports offer the same sense
of loyalty and camaraderie, but obvi-
ously without the killing - just look at
the thousands of fans that go to watch
their club or country play every week.
The same happens at university.
Every week you run out onto the pitch,
court or pool (probably shouldn’t run to
the pool, wet floors and all that...) ready
to represent your team, your club and
your university against an opposition
who are ready to do the same. When we
have a common enemy, that is when we
all come together and rally behind the
Imperial banner, or the Medicals ban-
ner, as the teams do battle against the
old enemy! This sense of loyalty and the
accompanied rivalry is why the students
who play sports (there are a few other
non-sporting examples) become one
of the most involved alumni, regularly
keeping in touch with the club. Some
even have alumni teams that play on
Saturdays. But this rivalry is capable of
bringing so many alumni together, not
just the sporty types. Just look at the
Oxford-Camridge Boat Race, the RSM-
CSM Bottle Match or any College Foot-
ball game in the USA. Alumni come in
their hundreds and thousands to watch
their alma matter play against the old en-
emy, some giving generous donations to
make sure that they keep on beating the
old enemy. Imperial’s rivalry between
the College and the Medicals is slowly
building up and every year, more and
more people are turning up to the JPR
Williams Cup in particular. Who knows,
we might eventually get enough people
coming back to support that the game
would have to move to bigger venues,
like that stadium in Twickenham...
If you are reading this and you are
not part of some team (and this does not
necessarily mean a sports team), I urge
you to join some club or society because
even though they will take up some of
your time now, they will introduce you
to some of your closest friends for years
to come! Plus it will give you something
to talk about in interviews.
Like I said, I’ve been here for a while
and won’t be around for ever, so I would
love it if I could get someone else to
get involved with the sports section. If
you’re interested, send me an email at
sport.felix@imperial.ac.uk!
So what’s new this year? Well as you
may have noticed, we’ve managed to get
a sponsor for the sports section, which
can only mean good things for you!
Winners of the sports league, which has
grown from strength to strength, will
receive polo shirts sponsored by Ernst
& Young and we are also thinking of
getting a shield to go in the Union Bar
so that everyone can know who the best
team at Imperial really are! We’re also
planning on having a Sports in Brief sec-
tion, where we would like all the cap-
tains to send a quick e-mail after their
game on Wednesday, letting us know
how they went on.
So, here we go again, good luck ev-
eryone, and keep us informed.
Texas State get this many people to their football games... MENTAL
