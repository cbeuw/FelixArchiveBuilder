A group of intrepid travellers make it to the summit of Mount Fuji
N
ot since the 50’s and 60’s
has the Imperial College
Union Rugby Football
Club (ICURFC) sent so
many tourists on an inter-
national tour. This summer, 41 members
of ICURFC went on a gruelling 18-day
tour to the land of the rising sun, visiting
the ancient capitals of Nara and Kyoto,
as well as the more modern cities of To-
kyo and Osaka.
As we arrived at Kansai Airport in
Osaka, we were pleased to see that one
of our tourists had arrived safely and
was waiting for us with a sign - as if
it would have been difficult to miss 40
rugby lads, all wearing matching suits!
Also waiting for us at the airport were
representatives from Kyoto University
Rugby Club, who had arranged for a
coach to take us to our hostel in central
Kyoto. A couple of hours later, we were
at our hostel and were settling in to the
two floors that had been assigned to us.
Our first set of games were the follow-
ing morning against Kyoto University,
the alma mater of South Kensington Kai
President Shunichi Nakamura, however,
this did not deter some of the lads to go
out in search of bars and were feeling
the effects of both jet lag and a hangover
as they got on the bus. As we pulled into
the grounds in Kobe, we quickly noticed
there was quite a large crowd - this we
were definitely not expecting.
First up on the schedule were the Im-
perial 1st XV, more commonly known
as the Imperial Ninjas, well at least on
this tour they were... Despite the heat
and humidity, the Ninjas put in a great
performance with Centre Joseph Brown
scoring a hat-trick and Full Back Kieran
Burge slotting 90% of his kicks that
gave the Ninjas a 61-19 win. Not a bad
way to start the tour! The Imperial 2nd
XV a.k.a the Imperial Barbarians put in
a brave performance against a Kyoto
side that saw many of their Old Boys’,
however, the jet-lag, humidity and, ul-
timately, their hangovers, caused them
to make small mistakes. In the end, the
Kyoto 2nd XV came away victorious,
winning the game 34-19.
After the game, we received our first
taste of Japanese hospitality, and it defi-
nitely took us by surprise! Waiting for us
in the function room were tables of beer,
sushi and fried chicken (!); not only
that, but Kyoto players, both past and
present had arrived in great numbers to
greet the touring side. After some chit-
chat over some sushi and Asahi beer, the
formal presentation and speeches com-
menced. In an effort to sound clever,
Tour Manager Jovan Nedic, decided
that his speech would be in Japanese and
quickly scribbled down some phrases on
the back of a plastic plate. Luckily the
hosts seemed to understand, but just in
case they didn’t, Club Captain Tim Burr
repeated the speech in English and also
presented the Club with an IC shield,
playing jersey and a silver tankard. That
evening was definitely a memorable ex-
perience with the two clubs exchanging
rugby culture - them, singing their club
song to us, whilst we presented them
with an Imperial College London tan-
kard, full of beer and a rousing round of
“Get it down, you Zulu warrior!”
There was a whole week until the next
game and that time was spent sightsee-
ing the temples and shrines of Kyoto and
Nara during the day, whilst socialising
with our Kyoto hosts in the evening. It
wasn’t long before we found our way to
the Karaoke bars where we also discov-
ered that drinks were free with the sing-
ing - it was going to be a good night...
As the week came to an end, we said
farewell to Kyoto and set off on the
Shinkansen for Tokyo. It was here that
we truly began to see the benefit of hav-
ing a Japanese speaker in the touring
party, as Hugh Jarman ensured that we
got on the right trains. Despite his use-
