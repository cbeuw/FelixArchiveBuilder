Welcome to the Felix Sports League, now in its fourth
year and going from strength to strength. Unlike the Union and Sport
Imperial Awards, this is purely based on your performance compared
to the rest of the College teams. Only BUCS league games count, so if
you’re not on their website, you’re not in the league; apologies also to
the ULU teams, but we can’t fit you all on here.The system is simple,
you win a game, you get 5 points; you draw a game, you get 2 points,
but if you lose a game, you are deducted 4 points.All scores are then
normalised by the number of games played to get the final index score.
At the end of the year, the winning team get a brand new set of polo-
shirts, kindly provided by our sponsors Ernst & Young.We’ve left in
the results from last year so you can see how your team did. Good luck
everyone!
This summer saw the tennis club travelling
to Valencia for their first competitive tour in
a decade, to Croatia in September for some
warm weather pre-season training and then
back to Spain and Palma de Mallorca to try to
recruit some Spanish talent for the new sea-
son.
Although the first two trips were not too suc-
cessful, the Mallorca trip proved to be highly
successful. After an exodus of players from
both men’s teams and the women’s team, the
president of the tennis club, Robert Bush, man-
aged to sign up Rafael Nadal just two weeks
before the season kick-off. The player was
signed up at Palma de Mallorca airport and will
be combining the end of year masters at the O2
where Roger Federer and Andy Murray will be
competing, with matches against UCL 1st, LSE
1st & 2nd and Brighton University. Unfortu-
nately, the tennis club still needs several play-
ers so please check out our website at www.
union.ic.ac.uk/tennis for more information on
how to try out. Alternatively email lawn.ten-
nis@imperial.ac.uk.
We have two training sessions a week for ev-
eryone and you can try-out for the match team
throughout the year as you improve with our
coaching.

Imperial to
host Japanese
Olympic Team
Rector Sir Keith O’Nions and Japanese Ministry Of-
ficial Mr Kubota sign the agreemenent
Imperial have signed an agreement with
the Japanese Olympic Committee that
will see the Olympic athletes and their
supporters using Imperial facilities dur-
ing the 2012 Olympic Games.
During the Games, which will be held
in the East End of London, the Japanese
athletes and supporters will have access
to training facilities at Ethos. College is
currently working with the JOC, explor-
ing other venues that could also be used.
They will also be offered accommoda-
tion in Princes Gardens. The Japanese
Judo and Wrestling teams will have ac-
cess to the sports hall in Ethos, where
they will be able to practice before head-
ing over to the ExCel arena where they
will fight for the gold medals.
The signing ceremony, held at 170
Queen’s Gate, was attended by an array
of delegates from both parties, including
Imperial Rector Sir Keith O’Nions and
Mr Kubota from the Japanese Ministry
of Education, Culture, Sports, Science
and Technology, who signed the agree-
ment.
Imperial’s Rector, Sir Keith O’Nions,
said: “I’m delighted that the Japanese
Olympic Committee wishes to use our
facilities for the Games. It seems par-
ticularly fitting given our great interna-
tional mix of staff and students, and our
position here in the cultural heartland
of London. I wish the Japanese Olym-
pic team the very best of luck in the
Games.”
This agreement with the JOC has
been in the pipe-line for several months,
working closely with Louborough Uni-
versity to secure the partnership. Before
coming to Imperial in the summer, the
Japanese athletes will have their pre-
Games training at Louborough Univer-
sity.
