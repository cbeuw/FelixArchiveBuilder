Horoscopes
Aries
This week you notice you’ve turned
into a fly. You spend the rest of the
day bumping into a window. When
you realise that it’s no worse than your
normal life you shed a fly-tear and
write a little fly-suicide note to your
non-existent friends.
Taurus
This week you smile and smile and
smile and smile and smile and smile
and smile and smile and smile and
smile and smile and smile and smile
and smile and smile and THEN
FUCKING SNAP AND PUSH A
PENCIL UP YOUR ARSEHOLE!!!
Gemini
This week you seriously doubt your
ability to hold a conversation with
another human being. To try and
dispel your doubts you go to a strip
club by yourself. Hey I didn’t say it had
to make sense, just be glad that you’re
finally getting to see some titties.
Cancer
This week you realise that your
fingertips are really sweaty. You lick
them, mmm that’s good. Your friends
agree. You start a business selling your
severed fingertips. After selling your
first batch you realise you have serious
supply issues and go bust...
Leo
This week you hold a dead fish in
your hand. You don’t let go. Months
pass and the rotting shrivelled mess
has seriously infected your hand.
On the last day of term, you take the
stinking fish and make a Fresher eat it.
BANTER!!! WHahey!!! You LAD!!!
Virgo
This week you take a massive dump in
the library toilets. You get up and look
at the horrible brown explosive mess.
And then you don’t flush. And the
next person to use the cubicle cries
because your nut-filled mahogany log
looks like their dead pet dog.
Libra
This week you’re puking up your guts
when a thought suddenly hits you;
can you create the siphon effect by
re-directing your vomit ‘back in’. With
a bit of tubing you succeed! Hurrah for
science! Unfortunately your roommate
is also excited... There’s no escape...
Scorpio
This week you’re happy...
just for a second...
and then you’re miserable again...
Sagittarius
This week you are some rude-boy
Asian cunt. You can’t get into Beit Hall
so you ask me to let you in. I don’t
have access so I say no. You call me a
“fag.” I am still angry about this. I hope
you die. That’s all. If you’re not this
guy, you have a lovely week :)`
Capricorn
This week you touch up your personal
tutor.. I think he’s enjoying it. Yeh he’s
totally getting off on it. You open your
eyes and realise it’s actually your mate,
but not your mate, your mum, but not
your mum your kid sister and... well
you can see where I’m going with this
Aquarius
This week you get to have a go in a
Zorb-ball. Unfortunately you quickly
suffocate as your friends have duct
taped all the air-holes coz they were
“only being LADS.” As per your will,
you are not buried but instead left to
rot in Alan Davies’ front garden.
Pisces
This week drug-crazied laser bird
dogs swoop down from the sky and
steal your lecture notes. You shake
your fist at them. When they see your
vintage fist shaking they return and
slice your throat with their titanium
talons...
Aunty
McPickle is
here to solve
all of your
problems
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I really really really want to pull a Fresh-
er. Not just pull a Fresher but also get
down to some serious nasty bed-time
fun. But someone told me that Freshers
were born in 1992, how can I live with
the age difference?
Yours Sincerely,
Horrifingly Old
Dear Horrifingly Old,
This is a rather intractable problem (if I
could make you younger I would!) One
solution would be to make yourself feel
younger. You could start by shaving all
your pubic hair, I hear that pre-pubes-
cent is the in-thing this season. Or that’s
what I gather from the news, everyone
seems to be after the kiddies. Personally
I blame Labour...
Use moisturiser,
Aunty McPickle
Dear Aunty McPickle,
I was thinking, if you wanted, you know
to maybe go out for dinner sometime?
And then we could maybe go to my
room in halls afterwards? My roommate
won’t mind, he’s always playing WoW.
I actually took a wank on his bed and he
didn’t notice... but that’s another story...
Sincerely,
Eager Fresher
Dear Eager Fresher,
Ooooh that sounds absolutely lovely! I
would definitely love to do that, I need
to get out of the house, the cats are get-
ting cranky. I’m free on Tuesday and
then after that on Friday (I need a few
days in between to clear out the ‘gunk’if
you know what I mean. I’m sure you...
you lovely boy.)
Excitedly,
Aunty McPickle
Fire Service admit that blaze
was “probably a four-man job”
