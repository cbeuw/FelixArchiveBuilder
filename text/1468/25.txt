t is a wet and windy evening in
Shepherd’s Bush, a resounding
confirmation that autumn is in-
deed upon us and we can now
forget our fancy dress frolics at
Bestival et al and concentrate on hud-
dling like arctic penguins in the cosy
confines of our metropolis’ musical
communes, such as the intimate Bush
Hall. Not that we gather solely for the
purpose of sharing body heat but rather
in order to pay homage the returning
prodigal son that is Willy Mason, play-
ing his first UK headlining show since
the good old days of 2007.
A distinct smell of damp greets us
as we enter; this evening’s headliner
falls firmly under the folk troubadour
title and so it is no head scratcher that
a whole spectrum of check shirts are on
parade amongst this selection of eclec-
tically aged demographic. Such shirts
smell pretty bad when wet.
Matthew & the Atlas are first on
the bill, a strong recommendation as a
more earthly antidote to the whimsical
musings and silly moustaches of the su-
premely overrated Mumford & Sons.
Matthew is a commanding presence
with a powerful voice that conveys much

Willy Mason whipped it out for
the Bush last Thursday
heart eventually turning the heads of the
initially disinterested and soggy crowd.
Next up is Markus Foster, who despite
a promising start backed by some inter-
esting percussion quickly veers off into
the realms of the mundane.
Mason’s arrival soon makes up for
any previous sentiment of feeling un-
derwhelmed and he is warmly received
by the crowd as Bob Dylan’s ‘I was
Young when I Left Home’ provides the
very appropriate walk on theme for Ma-
son and his backing band (including his
younger brother on drums) to take to the
stage. This seems appropriate as the-
matically it deals with home, something
that appears frequently throughout Ma-
son’s songs. Mason also channels a tra-
dition of American song writing much
in the same way that Dylan pre-Blonde
on Blonde channelled Woodie Guthrie.
However whereas Dylan would fall
back on more abstract images in his
humanitarian sentiment, Mason is ex-
plicit, with his notions of community
and togetherness very much evident.
The openness and naivety of Mason
makes him one of the most endear-
ing songwriters of our generation, his
heartfelt desire for justice and equality
beautifully demonstrated in ‘Oxygen’,
Mason’s eternal cry for a better world
in one the purest pieces of song writing
ever penned.
The set is perfectly judged; the first
half consists of a mixture of new songs
and tracks from his charming debut LP
‘Where the Humans Eat with Hard Hand
to Hold’ being particularly enjoyed by
the crowd. Halfway through, Mason’s
backing band head backstage for a well
deserved break with Mason wryly re-
marking that he had failed to join the
workers’ union. As an isolated figure,
Mason shines delivering a newly penned
tender ballad by the name of ‘the Need
of Love’: perhaps one of his strongest
songs to date as he recounts the tale of
young woman from a small mid-west
town, not searching but desperately
in need of affection. Mason’s voice is
particularly striking and with his band
absent it comes to the fore; he seems to
put no physical effort into his projec-
tion, yet creates a rich reverb of blissful
Americana. He brings tremendous depth
to riptide as he reminiscences about
carving his name into a cedar tree whilst
the ‘water in his soul, it is going to the
ocean’.
The band returns to close the set with
a rousing rendition of ‘Save Myself’
with the enthusiastic crowd providing
delicately pitched backing vocals and an
interesting re-working of a 17th century
love song, provided by one of Mason’s
female on stage accomplices. Mason is
in good spirits throughout and seems
to be genuinely moved by the warmth
of the crowd; such good feeling paves
Easy now. I know all this talk of ‘Willy’ and ‘Bush’ is exciting, but I assure you Mr.
Mason was the only Willy getting big love in the Bush... Well, in public at least
the way for an uplifting encore which
of course contains the aforementioned
‘Oxygen’. After a personal 5 year wait
for this event, I am deeply moved to be
hearing these songs in the flesh, I exit
onto a wet and windy Uxbridge Road
with Mason firmly cemented in head
and heart.

Tankian has been particularly ac-
tive during SOAD’s hiatus, releas-
ing one critically praised solo album
‘Elect The Dead’ and performing its
entirety on tour with a full symphonic
orchestra. This experience confirmed
Tankian’s talents as a composer, and
his second solo outing is further proof
of this man’s musical genius. Bril-
liantly blending electronic beats with
organic symphonic instruments along
with his inimitable voice, ‘Imperfect
Harmonies’ is a forward-thinking and
excellently executed collection of
songs which are guaranteed to have
you singing along. - Greg Power
Bradford Cox and company return
with an album that is definitely a
progression from previous releases.
Sprawls of noise have been refined,
leaning towards the band’s poppier
side that was exhibited on their last
album ‘Microcastle’. Their trademark
urgency has also been relaxed and the
general feel is more laid back. Deer-
hunter have never had a definitive
sound which means that every new al-
bum can carve its own ground, instead
of trying to recapture or rework an old
feeling. ‘Halycon Digest’ is a grower,
and will feel more rewarding with a
few listens. - Chris Walmsley
2007’s critically acclaimed ‘Nouns’
was an aggressive sonic attack, but
this new release from LA based No
Age benefits from more production
and melody throughout. The raw punk
rock energy has not been sacrificed,
but songs like ‘Depletion’ are now
mixed with subdued anthemic pop
classics like ‘Glitter’. No Age will
be winning no awards for vocal vir-
tuosity, but Dean Spunt’s voice has
been raised in the mix for most songs.
Despite the praise for their previous
record, this new album feels more
complete and as a result far more ac-
cessible. - Chris Walmsley
Abe Vigoda, a “tropical punk”
4-piece from the same scene as No
Age, have reconfigured their sound
with one eye firmly on The Cure’s
discography. What could be a hollow
exercise in Eighties revivalism is ably
dodged by the band’s excellent song-
writing. The frenetic guitars and gal-
loping rhythms, a trademark of their
earlier work, have been toned down in
favour of synth lines and histrionic vo-
cals. While the stormy atmosphere of
the album can sometimes get oppres-
sive, it is exciting to hear a band find-
ing a different framework to channel
their unique sound. - Jamie Fraser
After the aberration that was 2006’s
‘Minutes To Midnight’ there is a
strong chance most fans of LP’s first
two albums have dismissed the band
entirely by now. In a surprising turn
of events the rap-rockers have de-
cided to ditch the obvious formulaic
arena-pleasers and instead opt for a
more experimental approach this time
around. Half the album is composed
of short electronic experiments and
the other half contains some genuine-
ly good songs, especially the amazing
‘Blackout’. There is much work to be
done but this new direction is defi-
nitely an improvement. - Greg Power
