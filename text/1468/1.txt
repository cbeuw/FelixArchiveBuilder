Student dissatisfaction
persists at Imperial

pointment with staff across all depart-

Blyth Gallery curator

Mindy Lee, the curator of Imperial’s
very own Blyth Gallery (located on the

New college campus
opens in Singapore
Imperial College’s newest campus is
scheduled to accept its first students

Freshers’Fair disrupted

A bitter row between the Union and the
Department of Life Sciences has erupt-
ed over what Union President Alex Ken-
dall terms as the “deletion of Plant Sci-
ences” from Imperial. The re-structure
of the Life Sciences department, aimed
at plugging a £1.5 million hole in the
department’s finances, has provoked a
series of controversial accusations from
the Union including claims that the De-
partment has “severely misused” its sta-
tistics.
The restructure of the Life Sciences
Department involves merging three
Kadhim Shubber units, Plant and Microbial Sciences
(PMS), Cell Biology and Functional
Genomics (CBFG) and Biophysics into
a new unit called Integrative Cell Biol-
ogy. This will focus on high-throughput
platforms, systems biology of model or-
ganisms, functional physiology of mi-
crobes and systems neurobiology.
The absence of Plant Sciences from
the new units’ intended research areas
has led the accusation that Plant Sci-
ences will “vanish from the university”
at the research, post-graduate and un-
dergraduate levels. “The breadth of the
Imperial degree in Biology and Bio-
chemistry will suffer” the Union said in
