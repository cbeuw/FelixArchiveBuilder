4chan leaks smut pirate data
Battles between mainstream film
and recording industries and the
public over piracy issues have al-
ways been well documented. But
the conflict between porn studios
and your average pervert have re-
mained largely under wraps.
That situation changed last
week when 4chan decided to tar-
get one of the major legal play-
ers ACS:Law. While carrying
out their plan initially meant in-
timidating its CEO, they stumbled
upon an unencrypted text file con-
taining the names of 5000 people
who had been accused of pirating
porn. In typical 4chan style the file
was released to the public, caus-
ing massive embarrassment for
ACS:Law, Plusnet and BT (not
to mention the 5000 accused of
downloading titles such as ‘MILF
Magic 3’).
The leak kicked up a cloud of
dirt for everyone involved and
only the porn companies and
4chan getting any satisfaction
from the matter. It’s also thrown
into focus an issue previously un-
reported in technology circles - pi-
racy of pornography.
It’s well known that of all media
industries, pornography has suf-
fered the most at the hand of pira-
cy. ‘Free’ streaming sites lure the
vast majority of porn consumers
who are unwilling to risk dodgy
payments appearing on their bank
statements. Yet one card that the
porn industry can play is shame;
most customers would rather ad-
mit to downloading Phil Collins
than ‘Skin City’. ACS:Law is the
only remaining British company
that extorts money through this
legal form of blackmail, with most
mainstream media labels ditch-
ing this practice due to the bad
publicity it generates. Their strat-
egy is trivial. Upon reciept of an
infringing IP address, ACS:Law
contacts your ISP and demands
the personal details of the person
fingered by said IP address. Your
ISP is legally required to disclose
this information thanks to recently
passed privacy bills, and before
you know it there’s a letter in your
mail asking you to pay up for your
illegal download, failing which
your name will be released to the
public.
The scam in itself is legal, and
it’s easy to see why it might be
fairly successful. ACS:Law’s
failing was in its handling of
the confidential user data it was
handed by ISPs. The standard
procedure that any responsible
company should follow when
handed such data is to securely
encrypt it so that in case any part
of its infrastructure is compro-
mised, the hackers only come
away with gibberish.
What hackers found on
ACS:Law’s servers wasn’t gibber-
ish, but a backup of the entire web-
site including records of emails
sent by and within the company.
ACS:Law (and the ISPs that hand-
ed the firm the information) are
obliged to encrypt any communi-
cation that contains data that could
be in breach of the Digital Privacy
Act. In failing to do so they have
undergone investigation by the In-
formation Commissioner’s Office.
The ICO’s probing has launched
a tit-for-tat blame game across
the board, with the government,
ISPs and ACS:Law all blaming
each other. ACS:Law looks likely
to take most of the heat for this -
their eagerness to profit off some-
one else’s misfortune makes them
easy villains - but it’s worth noting
that none of the ISPs seem to have
had any qualms about handing
over the unencrypted information
either.
The legal ramifications of this
scandal won’t be obvious until
the ICO finishes its investiga-
tions, but it does raise some seri-
ous questions about the quality of
current legislation. If the govern-
ment wants to convince us that
this is for our benefit, they have
their work cut out for them - in
the meantime, you might want to
take precautions before grabbing
“Catch Her In The Eye” off Pirate
Bay.

Zuckerberg: The Man
The year 2010 may just be Mark
Zuckerberg’s finest. Having his
net worth more than triple to $6.9
billion, he has climbed the ranks
of the Forbes 400 list from #158
to #35. He even knocked Steve
Jobs off the throne of Geekdom as
Vanity Fair proclaimed him “our
new Caesar” by placing him at #1
in its 100 most influential people
of the New Establishment. And
this month, a biopic based on his
dramatic founding of Facebook is
coming out. Thing is, he’s only 26
years old.
The Facebook CEO is portrayed
as a punkish antihero in The Acci-
dental Billionaires, Ben Mezrich’s
dramatic retelling of the genesis of
Facebook, which The Social Net-
work is based on. David Kirkpat-
rick’s The Facebook Effect hails
him as a genius of our generation
who revolutionized the way we
interact with each other. Love him
or loathe him, one thing’s for sure,
Zuckerberg exudes a peculiar sort
of charisma.
The youngest self-made billion-
aire ever, he still lives in a rented
house shared with his girlfriend,
and has stuck to his trademark
hoodie in every public appear-
ance. In the movie, he is portrayed
as borderline autistic. It may be an
over-dramatization, but Zucker-
berg is well known to be socially
awkward. He speaks really fast,
often coming across as nervous,
but his words carry solid weight
and a dead-sure conviction. That
is the essence of Zuckerberg’s
charisma.
Mark’s steadfast and uncompro-
mising vision for Facebook was
key to its success today and also
a source of much frustration to his
colleagues. The Facebook Effect
reports that Mark has always been
adamant about maintaining an en-
joyable user experience over rev-
enue. He holds the majority of the
company’s board of director seats
in order to grow Facebook in ac-
cordance with his vision. His dic-
tatorship-like authority over the
direction of the company kept it
from being sold to Yahoo! in 2006
and being bogged down by ads.
But it may also have been behind
the reason for the departure of co-
founders Dustin Moskowitz and
Chris Hughes as Facebook grew.
Aptly timed before the release of
The Social Network, the Facebook
CEO went on Oprah announcing
a donation of $100 million worth
of Facebook shares to the Newark
school system. Critics think it’s a
pre-emptive move to protect his
image. Having read The Acciden-
tal Billionaires, I doubt the film
will do Mark’s reputation much
harm. Depicted as a gifted hacker
with a disregard for the norms of
social institutions, Zuckerberg
comes across as a modern-day
Byronic hero, albeit without the
womanizing. It might actually
propel him to rock-star status (at
least in Geekdom). However
Zuckerberg does have reasons to
be afraid for his reputation. Ear-
lier this year, Silicon Alley Insider
got hold of an old instant message
log detailing an exchange between
Zuckerberg and a friend when he
was still in Harvard. In the con-
versation, Mark called Facebook
users ‘dumb fucks’ for ‘trusting’
him. Zuckerberg later apologized
in an interview with The New
Yorker, citing his imma-
turity at that time.
User trust is the
cornerstone of Face-
book’s stellar success.
The willingness of users to share
their personal information on Fa-
cebook has made it the world’s
most comprehensive database.
Check back next week to find
out how every bit of info you give
Facebook makes it the most lucra-
tive Internet start-up ever known
to mankind.
