Letters FELIX, Friday June 12th 1987 2
The one we
had to print
Dear Dave,
I was appalled by the Rector's
comments in "The Ash Interview"
(FELIX 773) regarding FELIX.
Whereas I am totally opposed to the
publication of anonymous letters, or
letters written under a pseudonym (eg
last year's letters written by ' 'Spock''
and "James T Kirk"), I see nothing
"diabolical" in asking the Editor to
withhold the name or names of the
authors. I say this for two reasons:
firstly, if I had to make as serious a
complaint about my department as the
group of Civ Eng PGs had to make
about theirs, I would rather not be
singled out so that other people could
point their finger at me and say "He's
the one who complained" or "He's
the one who aired the dirty laundry
in public''. Secondly, the Rector may
well say this is a free society; but the
group of anti-Khomeini Iranian
students who wrote to FELIX some
months ago to inform us of the
atrocities committed in Iran in the
name of Islam have every reason to
fear reprisals from the pro-Khomeini
camp. It is only fair that these students
should be allowed to express their
views without endangering their
personal safety.
Professor Ash's other criticism of
FELIX, that it is too full of 'in-jokes'
and material which, according to him,
is "not likely to be of enormous
interest to more than about five per
cent of the students, is nonsense. I
cannot imagine what this material
could be, nor who this mysterious five
per cent of the IC student body is.
Apart from the occasional (and very
funny) episode of "The Baron of
Cheapskate", there is very little in the
way of gossip and jokes about the
Union officers, as the infamous (but
also very funny) "Below the Belt"
column is now defunct. If anybody
out there agrees with the Rector
simply because they keep seeing
references to "John Smith",
"Michael Arthur", "Brian Lloyd-
Davies'' and haven't a clue who these
people are or how they can affect our
lives at IC, they have only themselves
to blame. After all, you only have to
read FELIX each week, or even (dare
I say it) attend the odd UGM to know
exactly who these people are and what
they did, do and will do.
As for the Rector's suggestion that
FELIX should be devoting its time
and space to "looking at the role of
Imperial College in the country at
large", I would say that that is not
its raison d'etre; the assessment of
ICs role in the country is, in the main,
College's responsibility and they
should not expect the newspaper of
Imperial College Union to be doing
it for them,
Yours sincerely,
Alastair J Seymour
King Arthur
Nearly four years ago former FELIX
Editor Pallab Ghosh launched his first
issue with a scathing attack on
Michael Arthur, who was Student
Services Officer at the time. Pallab
called Mr Arthur the ' 'most arrogant
and unhelpful College official it has
been my misfortune to come across''.
There was no particular reason for
this, except that Pallab wanted to
make FELIX fun to read and Michael
Arthur had given him a hard time
over his second year rent bill.
Today Michael Arthur works in
College administration "headquar-
ters" and has responsibility for
student affairs such as
accommodation. After a year of
trying to get useful information out
of this man I have realised that he is
the biggest bullshitter I have ever met.
Mr Arthur's meddling in Union
finances, through his patronage of the
boat club, is quite out of order. To
summarise, if you did not get the full
position from our news stories, the
boat club approached Michael Arthur
for financial help when the Union
made it clear that there could be no
"advance" on next year's five year
plan money. Mr Arthur put up the
neccessary funds to buy the boat on
the understanding that the boat club
would have to "repay" it. Union
Finance Committee is faced with a
decision over whether or not to
allocate money for a boat which has
already been bought.
It is true that the boat in question,
the eight used by Oxford when they
won the university boat race, was
probably excellent value for money,
and that it had to be bought quickly
or not at all. It is true also that the
boat club has been exceptionally
successful, has received a lot of
coverage in the national press, and is
an excellent advertisement for
Imperial College. This is why the club
can so readily call on the help of
College admin.
One for the Road
I have to say that I'm really rather
ashamed of this issue. So far this term
we have had one 16-page FELIX, one
12-page FELIX with 12 pages of
annual reports and four other 12-page
issues. This time last year I was
boldly planning to bring out a regular
20 pages, and never fall below
sixteen; 10 pages seems a little
pathetic. Hopefully the final issue will
make up for all the thin ones—I intend
to publish at least 36 pages, which
will include all the features we've
been saving up until the end of the
year. I hope to have this out Friday
June 19th, though there is a possibility
that it will have to be delayed until
Wednesday June 24th. Try to hang
around to see a copy; it should be
worth reading.
If anyone would like a hand-bound
edition of this year's FELIX, could
they please give me their name by
next Friday. A bound-edition will cost
£22.00, but they are well worth it,
and it is the only way to make sure
that a full set of issues can be kept in
top class condition.
