Conservative candidates have been returned in
Westminster South and Fulham, two of the
constituencies in which most Imperial College
students will have voted. Hammersmith was held by
the Labour candidate, and the results from Chelsea
and Kensington are not expected until around
midday today.
At the time of going to press, with only about 50 results still
to be declared, the Conservatives had won 347 seats, Labour
225, the Alliance 14 and Others 6. Though these figures
represent a small gain by the Labour party on the 1983 result,
the Conservatives have clearly won another landslide majority.
The Alliance did particularly poorly, after hopes of holding the
balance of power, and lost some of the seats which they had
won four years ago.
The local results are symptomatic of the general trend.
Labour's Nick Raynsford will be particularly disappointed to
lose Fulham to the Conservatives, having only recently won
the seat in last year's by-election. He polled only 15,430 votes,
as compared to 21,752 for Carrington (Conservative). In
Westminster South, the constituency which contains most of
the College Halls of residence, the Labour candidate polled only
three thousand less than the Conservative candidate, who won
the seat with just under twenty thousand votes.
Drama occurred early in the day when F E L I X photographer
David Burns arrived at the polling station to cast his vote, only
to be told that he had already voted. After protesting vehemently
to the polling officials M r Burns felt sufficiently incensed to
rush over to the FELLX office to submit a late 'Small A d ' . Later,
FELLX Editor-elect Judith Hackney was interviewed by Swedish
Radio, whilst watching the election results on the video screen
in Picadilly Circus.
