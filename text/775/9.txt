Hon Sec Dave Colley yesterday
appealed for students' responses to the
planned £25 parking charge. The
charge, which was reported in last
week's FELIX, has brought strong
complaints from members of the
College Trade Unions, prompting the
LInion leaders to write in reply to the
College Secretary, John Smith. Mr
Colley wishes to write a similar letter
to Mr Smith.
The method by which the increase
was decided has also annoyed Mr
Colley, who maintains the Finance
and Executive Committee did not
make afinaldecision but referred the
matter back to the Rector. Mr John
Chalmers, Senior Assistant Secretary,
took the minutes of the F and E
meeting in question. He commented:
"It is my understanding that after the
meeting, the Rector and the College
Secretary discussed how to implement
the measures", adding that the
decision had already been taken at the
meeting.
The new system of charging staff
and students for parking permits will
begin at the start of the next session.
US of Aid
A group of American students raided
Southside Shop on Saturday, in a bid
to help London's down and outs. The
students, who were about to finish
their courses at the American Institute
of Foreign Studies, discovered that
they still had £180 of vouchers which
could be exchanged for food
throughout Imperial College and
other parts of the University of
London. Descending on Southside
Shop they bought all the perishable
goods, which they distributed
amongst disadvantaged people on
Saturday and Sunday evenings.
Refectories Manager, Mr Rob
Northey, who runs Southside Shop,
was not surprised by the events. The
Americans spend about £7000 worth
of vouchers per month and sometimes
up to £300 in one day if they are about
to go home, he explained. When told
about the donation of food, he
commented "it seems a very good
cause".

Learning to learn
Imperial is to publish a guide to
learning at College, to be distributed
to first and second years in the
Autumn Term. Entitled "Study
Survival", the booklet has been
written by Dr Lester Kershenbaum
and Dr Gareth Jones with assistance
from the Undergraduate Studies
Committee. The twelve page book is
to form the basis of courses run by
individual departments to encourage
students to use better studying
methods.
The guide concentrates on the ways
of solving problem sheets, taking
lecture notes and basic learning
patterns.
Profs
object
A group of academics have written an
"Open Letter to the Academic
Community" expressing their
dissatisfaction with the Labour
Party's proposed defence policy. The
letter published in The Independent on
Tuesday June 9th states that despite
the mildness of the Labour Party's
Manifesto, a Labour Government
would remove American nuclear
bases from Britain and leave Britain's
forces without their own nuclear
potential. It says that this will
undermine NATO, reduce the
prospects of multilateral armaments
reductions and encourage the USA to
become more isolationist. Ultimately,
it claims, this would leave Britain
defenceless against Soviet nuclear
blackmail. This, they feel, poses an
unacceptable risk, increasing the
likelihood of a Third World War.
Amongst the 102 names on the list are
included several lecturers from
Oxford University and some London
colleges, but none from IC.
The open letter appearedfivedays
after "A Manifesto for Science" was
published by The Guardian. In this,
the Labour policies to support
scientific research and development
are described. The 72 signatories
include two Nobel laureates and Neil
Kinnock. The names of Prof Tom
Kibble, Head of Physics at IC, and
Dr David Caplm, also in the Physics
Department, appear on the list.
What, no
warden?
There will be only one warden in the
new hostel in Evelyn Gardens next
session. At a meeting of the Rector's
policy committee on June 2nd it was
decided to go against the wishes of the
Student Residence Committee, which
had recommended that two wardens
be appointed for the 200 place
residence.
The committee decided to uphold
the wishes of SRC on the issue of
Wardens in Southside. There will not
now be an additional warden
appointed for Selkirk/Tizard Hall.
This means that there will still be
places available for students' use in
the Southside Penthouse flats.
Visually

Observations " opened at the Natural
History museum on Wednesday. This
exhibition is of the pastfifteenyears
of work by the Royal College of Art
Natural History Illustration Unit and
is said to be "visually exciting".
