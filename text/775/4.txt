s next to
last bit
There's not an awful lot to say this week.
Things are winding down for the end of
term—and my major problem now is
getting a copy of the AIDS information
booklet (which some of you will already
have received) to everybody before they
all leave for the summer. If anyone can
spare the odd hour to help filling and
labelling envelopes, I'd be more than
grateful. This will be going on over the
weekend and most of next week as
well—ask in the office.
Hamlet Gardens
If you're panicking about somewhere to
live next year, you might be interested
to know that there are extra Head
Tenancy flats available in Hamlet
Gardens, Hammersmith. Theseflatsare
for 6, 7 or 8 people; they might not be
palatial, but they are reasonable and
inexpensive. Hammersmith is a good
place to live with plenty going on and
it's only 20 minutes away from College.
If you're interested, get a group of
people together and pick up an
application form from the Student
Accom-modation Office in Prince's
Gardens. By the way, it is possible to
live happily in a group of 6—8 people
(I managed it last year) and it keeps your
bills low.
Student Managers
Next Wednesday is the closing date for
applications for the posts of Head
Tenancy student managers—posts which
carry guaranteed reduced-rent (or free)
accommodation. If you're interested in
going for one of these posts, pick up an
application form, cover note and job
description from the Union Office.
Interviews will be held on Tuesday June
23rd and Wednesday June 24th.
That's all for now,
Christine

You may have queued for hours trying to
get into London's most exciting show. But
on June 21st, no queuing...just a special
private invitation for you to visit Launch
Pad, at the Science Museum.
No glass cases where you read and just
look. Here everything is to be touched,
handled, taken apart, climbed on, shouted
at, whispered to, walked through and sat
on. Science in Action. Launch pad will
launch you whether you're 6 or 60 or a
voyage of dicovery about science, about
new technology. You might even decide
to make a career of it. That's why it's
called "Launch Pad".
The Science Museum is providing for
us on the 21st special Gallery guides to
explain, to answer question and to give
exciting demonstrations.
Specially for IC there will be "Do-it-
at-home-yourself' demonstrations.
There will be a book on sale to help you
find out more. You can't afford to miss
it. A great opportunity to have fun and to
launch yourself.
New start time: 3pm, June 21st due to
ovewhelming popular demand.
