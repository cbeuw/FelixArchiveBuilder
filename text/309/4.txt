In place of Felix
Part 2 of a
4 part series
Hi there, fans and magazine-lovers everywhere. I hope
you enjoyed sampling the mags I reviewed last time,
and haven't spent too agonizing a fortnight waiting for
this little batch of literary political gems.
This w e e k political down and follows the party
papers are the object of
my attentions both left and
right-wing ones. All I shall
say about the dailies is just
a brief run-down as fol-
lows :
RIGHT-WING: "Telegraph"
— favourite of a popular
subwarden and of a de-
cidedly fascist nature.
Good for determined cap-
italists (like me) who like
a no-nonsense biased view
of current politics and love
Ted (unlike me). "Daily
Excess" is just that. " M a i l "
— tabloid Excess. "Times"
is usually boring, but has
occasional and unpredict-
able revolutionary out-
bursts.
LEFT-WING: " G u a r d i a n " —
everyone knows that it's
the ultimate in British daily
papers, whatever your
point of view ."Mirror"
doesn't bear looking in.
"Morning Star" is opposite
of Telegraph.
NOWHERE: " S u n " — yes,
there are 2 J million statis-
ticians in the country. The
Editor doesn't know what
"political" means.
SUNDAYS: In a class by
themselves. " S . Times" is
good but massive and ex-
pensive. "Observer" —
ghastly. "Express" as if
you haven't had enough
Excesses during the week.
"Sunday People" — no,
the new name doesn't im-
prove it. "Mirror" — no
comment. "Telegraph" —
like the daily with added
Peregrine Worsthorne (if
his name doesn't put you
off, try reading one of his
articles ! ) . " News of
t'World" — I'm lost for
words.
Now to the weeklies,
which is what I'm really in-
terested in. I've deliber-
ately left out some of the
'progressives' — most of
you read one or more of
them regularly anyway,
and you wouldn't appreci-
ate any real criticism I
made of them. In "British
Rate and Data", the Bible
of publications, " O z " , for
instance, coming under the
sub-heading of 'Teenage
and Pop mags' is sand-
wiched between "Fabulous
208" and "Petticoat" —
and that's where it can
stay. The " R e d Mole" can
be recommended to young
revolutionaries, whereas
"Ink" can't be recom-
mended to anyone.
I may as well start with
the only Right-wing weekly
of any note, i.e. the "Spec-
tator". It is, however, by
no means a paper that sits
line, and indeed backs up
its claim to be outspoken.
Rather more so than its dir-
ect competitor in the left-
wing sector, the " N e w
Statesman", which can be
relied upon to follow the
line at least 20 per cent of
the time. The "Statesman"
tends, however, to knock
the Labour party leader-
ship on many matters. A l -
though nothing like as old-
established as the "Spec-
tator", which has been
going since 1828, the
"New Statesman" is still
quite an old stager, since
it has existed in one form
or another since the begin-
ning of the century.
But if you want pure, un-
adulterated, strict party
line Labourism from a
paper, try the "Labour
Weekly", which this week
just runs into its 21st issue.
It makes comforting read-
ing for Labour party mem-
bers, yet is probably as
odious as Toryism to pro-
gressive Socialists. Unlike
the Spectator and States-
man it is all political com-
ment, and does not, like
the two latter publications,
take up half its space with
reviews. (Incidentally, and
apolitically, the Statesman
is probably the most cruel
critic of the arts in print
today, and well worth read-
ing —• but take it with a
pinch of salt).
The Socialist version of
"Labour Weekly" has been
going for rather more than
21 issues — more like 36
years, in fact! It's name is
"Tribune", and it's the
original ' revolutionist '
weekly. Also, unlike all its
recent imitators (e.g. "Red
Mole", "Ink", " 7 Days") it
is widely read and taken
as an authority by all poli-
ticians and political com-
mentators. Add to that the
fact that it's usually writ-
ten in correct English
grammar, contains real
facts, and costs only half
as much as the others, and
it becomes plain that it is
still the best weekly for
Socialists. There's even a
cheap rate for students.
It's only intelligent com-
petitor these days is a new
paper (only 15 issues)
called " 7 Days", which is
showing terrific promise. It
'is printed superbly for a
weekly political, but unfor-
tunately they do charge a
lot for it. If it survives des-
pite this, as it should, I
predict that in 2008, when
it is as old as "Tribune" is
now, it will be at least as
The Cooking Pot

soldier-cum-settlcr of today is as much
couraged to miscegenate as his counter-part
was in (he levies of settlers during the 16th
century. Moreover, I have first-hand knowledge
that a propensity for multi-racialism cuts
across political convictions. The equation made
in the United States and Britain beiween multi-
racialism and democracy, strikes me as naive,
and (he inability to understand the situations in
Brazil and Portugal would appear to be an
extension of ingrained cultural prejudices.

authoritative as the latter.
It will probably be the only
one launched in the last
five years to last that long.
Every weekly that I've so
far reviewed requires you
to have read the daily
press pretty thoroughly to
understand what they're
going on about. Now for
three that don't. The first
two are "world" maga-
zines, based in the U.S.,
which are both Conserva-
tive, one more so than the
other. However, you might
still enjoy them if you're a
Communist. (They have
large pictures of Nixon
suitable for dart-boards). I
need hardly tell you that
I'm talking about "Time"
— the Democrat (NOT
democratic) one — and
"Newsweek", the Repub-
lican one. Expensive but
glossy.
The third is the "Guard-
ian Weekly", which is just
a condensed version of the
previous week's dailies.
Although primarily intend-
ed for export, if you have
only time to read one
paper a week and want
both facts and comment,
both of the informed and
'sensible' variety, you
really can't do better.
You'll probably have to
order it, but you can take
my word for it that it's
worth it.
Well, that's it for this
time. I hope that you'll
spend a few hours explor-
ing political papers —•
you'll find quite a number
that I haven't mentioned
which may suit you better.
Rapidly turning my back
on political publications,
I'm going to spend the next
fortnight wading through
some "Glossies" (e.g.
"Country Life", "Tatler",
etc.), and I'll report back
to you in a fortnight's time.
Happy browsing !
Chinese
Technology
A year or so ago Mr. Anthony
Wedgwood Benn was invited to
spend 12 days in mainland
China to see the progress of
Chinese Technology under Com-
munist rule. He was at Imperial
by invitation of THIRD WORLD
FIRST — UNSA to recount his
experiences.
Before enlightening us upon
the advances in Chinese Tech-
nology, Mr. Wedgwood Benn
asked us first to bear in mind
two points about China's histor-
ical development. Firstly that this
country is the only one in the
world that has developed with-
out foreign aid. (It did receive
very limited Soviet aid until
1960). Its progress has been
remarkable and even its strong-
est critics now admit that starv-
ation has been virtually elimin-
ated in spite of the development
of advanced rocketry and the
H-bomb. Compare this with the
rest of Asia for the similar
period.
Secondly, one has to remem-
ber that China's immediate his-
tory has been one of complete
upheaval. During the 19th cen-
tury there were Opium Wars fol-
lowed by foreign colonisation
and the 1920's saw the start of
a civil war, which has continued,
apart from the interruption of
the Japanese invasion during the
second world war, to the present
day with the nationalist occupa-
tion of Formosa.
At this point, he was careful
to point out that just as Western
civilisation does not work in the
East, one could also assume the
opposite. So whilst our fears of
invasion by hordes of Chinese
were allayed, he tried to explain
the motives and results of the
'Cultural Revolution'. Mao Tse
Tung had realised that the Com-
munist Revolution of 1949 had
merely traded one form of bur-
eaucracy for another instead of
instituting communism in its real
sense. In true Confucian tradi-
tion, the Chinese call this for-
mer type of Communism, 'Cap-
italism'. This, they recognise,
exists in the Soviet Union, hence
the split from Soviet Commun-
ism. Mao is acutely conscious
that the 'class struggle' does not
cease with the transfer of power
and expects that true commun-
ism will flourish in about 300
years time.
One of the biggest changes
that has occurred in China, is in
the educational system. Mao fer-.
vently believes that education
should be used for the benefit
of the state. To this end, instead
of separating education from
work, he tries to integrate it as
much as possible. For instance
children at primary and second-
ary schools do light manual
work for about 1 or 2 hours a
day in addition to their studies.
After secondary school, every-
one works and then the workers
decide amongst themselves who
will go to university at the age
of twenty. All courses at univer-
sity are of the sandwich type
and the lecturers are normally
factory workers who come to
lecture on their problems in fac-
tories, etc. Compare this with
the USA where higher educa-
tion has reached absurd propor-
tions, can a post doctoral quali-
fication in journalistic photo-
graphy solve racial, pollution or
poverty problems?
'What', asked an aspiring
member of the audience, 'will
become of all those budding
Chinese genii who will be stifled
by this education system?'
Mr. Wedgwood Benn replied
that in all cases great inventors
have been ordinary workers and
that any country that invents
more than it can use, e.g. Bri-
tain, is being wasteful and only
increasing national pride!
Mao decided that the order of
Chinese development should be
agriculture, light industry, heavy
industry. In this way (as every
budding ecologist knows) unem-
ployment is kept at a low level
by using people as a resource.
Wherever industry is encour-
aged, a commune approach is
adopted and the traditional man-
agerial structure (as it exists in
the Soviet Union) is rejected,
as they believe it is potentially
corrupt. One only has to look at
industrial Kibbutz in Israel to
see how well this approach
works in underdeveloped coun-
tries.
Mao is always worried about
the disconnection of those who
rule from those who produce. In
his rule as leader of the Chinese
people, he leaves Chou En Lai
to run the state while he sees
himself as a teacher or 'a lonely
old monk walking through life
with a leaky umbrella'.
B.C.W.
Union President, JOHN McCULLOUGH, speaks
ICU has now submitted 7 motions to NUS for the Easter National
Conference in Birmingham. Just before going through the motions,
it might be best to say that the basic reasons why we submit
motions to NUS are threefold—to get the NUS executive to do
something, to get individual constituent organisations to do some-
thing or to bring our point of view at least to the notice of others.
So what are we spouting off about this time?
Womens Lib—basically a statement of our belief in equality for
women. We are asking C.O.'s to set up women's groups to cam-
paign and make available contraceptives, abortions, etc. to their
own women students.
Student Wage—the NUS has agreed in principle to the concept
of a student wage. If one takes as a basis that education is a
right of everyone, then people participating of education ought to
be paid to be able to further that education. By campaigning for
student wages we are strongly campaigning against student loans.
Our motion asks for the setting up of a working party to prepare an
analysis of all the problems and implications associated with the
Student Wage concept and for the Executive to plan ahead in de-
tail for the second and third stages of the campaign, i.e. putting
over the arguments to our membership and then to the Govern-
ment.
Entrance to Higher Education—this motion calls for a new initia-
tive in the field of schools/Student Union liaison. Activity within
IC has been growing in terms of meeting interviewees etc. within
the last couple of years and now USK, in co-ordination with the
local Trades Council, is hoping to participate within an Open Day
at a local Grammar School. The motion calls on areas (like U.S.K.)
to organise a rota of visits to local schools, too make initial con-
tacts in schools with a view to encouraging the formation of
schools' Unions and calls on the NUS executive to produce a
leaflet for national distribution to 6th formers, enumerating student
Union contacts so that 6th formers can contact students in Col-
lege before choosing their paths into Higher Education.
Educational Philosophy—The James Report that has just been pub-
lished favours a sectionalised system of higher education. The
NUS for a long time has in general terms favoured a Comprehen-
sive, anti-binary, University system. Our motion tries to state this
ideal in practical terms.
Environment—Our motion calls for NUS support on a broad level
for the priciples embodied in the "Blueprint for Survival" publica-
tion. It also calls on the NUS to demand full representation in
talks on implementation of Rothschild and Painton reports, believ-
ing that Research is a subject closely linked to the Environment.
Entertainments—The NUS passed a motion at Margate in the
Autumn calling for Ents Committees to book groups on a percen-
tage basis. Unfortunately, this only works to our advantage if this
percentage is a percentage of the profits and not the gross takings
(Rubbish—Ed.) and until all Unions work in unison on this one
we will get nowhere.
Any comments?—come in and seem me sometime and tell me
what else you think we ought to be talking about within NUS.
About the time you read this we will be deciding which amend-
ments we will be putting in.
IN FACT, although I've tried to say it n times before, unless
people come into the Union office and tell us what they want us
to do, or what we're doing wrong, we'll never know . . .
