It was, as Steve Marriott
probably said, a diabolical
liberty. He had just been
refused admission for the
third time, and had had to
swallow his modesty and
tell the doormen that he
was indeed yer actual loo-
ner Mad Marriott. The nine
to twelve power cut did not
help matters and those in
charge of admission did a
grand job in very trying
circumstances. Meanwhile
back at the ball (s-up)
everyone had a good time,
taking advantage of the
anonymity imposed by
darkness to do fun things
like smashing windows
and dropping flowerpots
from great heights to see
what happened. Now folks
I can announce the result.
The flower pots broke into
little pieces which were
eagerly cleared up by the
six or so people who stay-
ed to clear up, finishing at
7.30 on Saturday evening,
just in time for the Ents
concert. People also con-
trived to relieve themselv-
es in the most imaginative
places, not for them the
dull rut of using a lavatory.
Still, drinking is great fun,
I'm sure they enjoyed
themselves and that was
what it was all about.
Unfortunately, I didn't
get to see films, or Dando
Shaft, who came on after
Humble Pie, or Al Stewart
who played in a very crow-
ded J.C.R. but I gather all
were well received. I think
everyone will agree that
the groups were chosen to
appeal to the greatest
numbers. Most people had
of course come to see
Humble Pie, but the recep-
tions accorded to Wild An-
gels and Hookfoot showed
that they had plenty of fans
there too. The ever-popu-
lar Miss Linda Lewis be-
gan with a set similar to
her last one here (see is-
sue 307). Nuff said. Wild
Angels came on next, and
all the greasers stood up
to be counted. To be hon-
est I thought they were
awful but I didn't like the
originals of the songs they
recreate very much, al-
though they did it with
admirable fidelity. But Big
Deal! Why not dig out
some dusty 78s and play
them, for a fraction of the
cost. The only original part
of the act was an excellent
drum solo, but what a pity
that such musicians are
wasted in a group like
this.
Then came Hookfoot. It
really beats me why they
have never made it big.
Caleb Quaye is an excel-
lent guitarist in a Zappa-
ish sort of way, and I rec-
kon he could make the
guitar come when he call-
ed it. He was getting mar-
ried the following day so
this was a great night to
let it all out, which he did.
Especially good was a ver-
sion of Neil Young's 'Ohio'
and their new single,
'Sweet Funky Music',
which just about sums the
group up, although come
to think of it I've never
worked out what that word
funky means. The group
were visibly bucked by
their reception but unfor-
tunately time did not per-
mit an encore.
Steve Marriott eventu-
ally impressed his identity
on the doormen and Hum-
ble Pie took the stage at
1.15, all systems go and
sod the powercuts
(quote). L a u n c h i n g
straight into 'Four Day
Creep' they soon had the
crowd on their feet. High-
light of the ace was, as
usual, Steve Marriott's nar-
rative on 'Rolling Stone',
about the chick in Man-
chester and her mother
who had designs on him,
and how every time he
went to her house she
made him eat lots of sand-
wiches, and other interest-
ing bits which space and
good taste do not permit
my enlarging on.
The group announced
the arrival of their new
L.P., 'Smokin' ' and played
a song from it about
peaches or something. It
should be a winner. If I've
given the impression that
Humble Pie are the Steve
Marriott show then I'd bet-
ter rewrite this review, but
as it is now 7 o'clock Sun-
day I shall tag on the con-
dolences to Dave Clemp-
son, Greg Ridley and Jerry
Shirley. Clem must like
having so much freedom
after his rather restricted
existence with Collosseum
—it's almost like the days
of Bakerloo again. Greg
Ridley has the most soul-
ful voice of the three sing-
ers and Jerry Shirley is
one of the heaviest drum-
mers around, but doesn't
need any ego-tripping
solos to prove how good
he is. The group played
about three encores and
finally left at about 2.30.
I picked my way over bro-
ken bottles, recumbent
bodies and other garbage
and headed for home, de-
termined to become a tee-
totaller.
