WHO WANTS A JOB ANYWAY?
This article has been
written at the request of
the Editor of 'Felix' in an
attempt to help students
who will be looking for
jobs in the near future. It
comes perhaps rather late
for the third year students
who are currently attend-
ing interviews and who are
probably well aware of the
facilities mentioned here-
in. It is also possibly too
early for first year students
who will not be involved in
the job hunt yet, but I
hope it will help the
second year students who
are not yet giving consi-
deration to the problems
of employment which
await them.
There is no point in try-
ing to hide the fact that
the employment situation
has deteriorated rapidly
during the past eighteen
months and that present
day graduates will not find
it easy to obtain a job on
leaving the College.
At Imperial College
there is a member of the
academic staff in each de-
partment who is a member
of the Sub Committee of
the Appointments Board
of the College. Any stu-
dent, first, second and
third year, or postgraduate
can consult his departmen-
tal representative who will
give as much advice and
assistance as possible
concerning employment,
but before consulting him
the students may wish to
explore for themselves the
opportunities which exist.
There are several publi-
cations which can be of
great help to a student
who requires career infor-
mation. Among these is
the 'Directory of Opportun-
ities for Graduates' which
is published by the Corn-
market Careers Centre
Ltd. This book gives infor-
mation about a large num-
ber of firms and organisa-
tions who have an interest
in recruiting graduates,
and reference to this book
will answer a lot of the
questions which occur to
all job hunters. On similar
lines is another book from
Classic Publications Ltd.
'Professional Careers for
Graduate Scientists and
Engineers', and yet an-
other book 'G.O. 72' has
recently appeared.
These books are excel-
lent in giving students
ideas and information con-
cerning companies but
they still do not supply the
whole answer to the ques-
tion "What type of job can
I get when I graduate".
Many firms this year
have curtailed their re-
cruitment, to the dismay of
those students who had
hoped to enter industry
through one of the well
known industrial organisa-
tions, and it is often neces-
sary to look in other direc-
tions for ideas.
For the student who
wishes to use his degree
in wider fields there are
openings which are per-
haps not readily appre-
ciated, such as Account-
ancy, Banking, Insurance,
the City, the Armed Ser-
vies and the Police, to
name but a few. One year
a student entered a Monas-
tery after graduation but
he, of course, was an ex-
ception. A good guide to
these wider fields is a pub-
lication issued by the
Careers Research and A d -
visory Centre entitled
"Beyond a Degree" which
is available for reference
from the departmental
representative or from the
Careers Library Room 303,
level 3, College Block.
The College Appoint-
ments Board has strong
links with the University of
London Careers Advisory
Service and advantage has
been taken of the Field
Officer Service operated
by ULCAS. Mr. Peter Ash-
worth, a senior officer in
the Service, visits the Col-
lege two or three times a
week throughout the year
to help students make de-
cisions about careers and,
in many cases, to help put
them in touch with pos-
sible employers. Any stu-
dents wishing to see the
Field Officer should first
consult their departmental
representatives.
Each year, the College
Appointments Board ar-
ranges for a series of
careers talks to be given
during Tuesday and Thurs-
day lunchtimes during the
Autumn term. These talks,
which are held in one of
the lecture theatres in Col-
lege Block, are given by
leading men and women
in various occupational
fields. Opportunity is given
at the end of each talk for
questions and much valu-
able information c a n be
obtained. Students of all
years are cordially invited
to attend. The theatres
hold about 150 and a "full
house" can be reckoned
to inspire the speaker more
INTERNATIONAL CHOPPER
(KARATE) AT IMPERIAL
World Champion Karate
Instructor at Imperial Col-
lege:— Perhaps of all the
sports practised at our es-
tablishment, KARATE has
the unfortunate position of
being the least publicised.
This blurb is part of an ad-
vertisement campaign to
rectify the situation.
It is of prime importance
to maintain a healthy phy-
sical and mental attitude
—'Mens sana in corpore
sano'—Karate is a sport
which provide those quali-
ties by releasing our own
aggressive instincts in a
constructive manner and
also giving an opportunity
for competition.
This can be achieved
(though not easily) under
the instruction of Sensei
Enoeda. He is probably
the best instructor in Great
Britain at present. Sensei
Enoeda, 6th Dan black
belt is at present chief in-
structor for the Japanese
Karate Association, in
Great Britain. He was all-
Japan-Champion in 1963-
1964 and World Champion
also in '63. Since then he
has devoted his time to
the instruction and im-
provement of Karate.
Besides Sensei Enoeda,
we have two very able
brown belts, the captain
and treasurer who can
provide invaluable tuition
for any person of the same
standard or lower. Indeed
from the instruction that is
available, any beginner
(like myself) should be
able to proceed rapidly to
a very high standard with-
in a year.
However, despite the ex-
cellent facilities available,
it is still a hard sport, de-
manding a lot of strength,
stamina and mental effort
as in any other specialist
field where one has to
strive for perfection. These
qualities are soon deve-
loped. At first the training
is quite basic. Suppleness
of limbs and body is de-
veloped with special exer-
cises at the beginning of
each session. This is then
followed by basic body
movements in karate
which include punching,
kicking, blocking etc. The
session usuallyends with
practice of fighting tech-
niques and kata—a series
of movements requiring
delicate balance and
graceful execution. All this-
is practised at the Union
Gym every Wednesday
1.15—2.15 p.m. In addition,
informal training periods
occur on Thursday lunch
breaks.
The sport is cheap at Col-
lege—50p for entry now
—and suits are loaned by
the club. (Average prices
of external instruction
range from £8—£12 per
annum and also 50p per
session).
Any male or female who
is interested in our flour-
ishing activities will be
very welcome at the Union
Gym. Or contact C. Brown,

than rows of empty seats.
Programmes of the talks
will be widely distributed
after the summer vacation.
Having used the various
aids and having decided
what types of jobs to try
for, the next question is
"How do I obtain such a
job".
The A p p o i n t m e n t s
Board publishes lists each
Autumn showing the firms
who will be visiting the
College in the Spring term
to interview applicants for
employment. These lists
are available through the
departmental representa-
tives and are accompanied
by forms for registering for
interviews.
The Careers Library in
College Block will have
copies of many firms bro-
chures for distribution and
students are recommend-
ed to study this literature.
At this point it is prob-
ably relevant to offer some
advice concerning the in-
terviews which has been
gathered from talks with a
number of interviewers.
a) Be punctual for your
interviews. The inter-
viewer is working to a
tight timetable and im-
punctuality can result
in an unsatisfactory in-
terview, in which the
student does not do
himself justice.
b) Be well groomed. This
does not call for any
further comment.
c) If you have been pro-
vided with an applica-
tion form, complete it
with care and have it
available when request-
ed. Some firms will use
pre-selection methods
for which early return
of a form is necessary.
If a date for the return
of the form is stipulated
it is advisable to keep
to it.
d) Read the company
literature before the
interview and have
some idea of the vac-
ancy for which you are
applying. Interviewers
are not very willing to
r e p e a t information
which is already fully
covered in their firm's
brochure, neither do
they warm to the stu-
dent who has no idea
what he wants to do
within the firm.
e) Don't be too modest.
You have to "sell"
yourself and you can-
not expect the inter-
viewer, however expert
he may be, to "draw"
you all the time. If you
have done something
which you consider
noteworthy work this
fact into the conversa-
tion. It may be the turn-
ing point in your favour.
All of these do's and
don'ts make job seeking
appear difficult; it is, but
you can be assured that
the Appointments Board
representatives will do all
they can to help you.
Finally, don't ignore the
daily press advertisements.
The Appointments Board
does not hear of every job
offer and some firms may
not even have heard of the
Appointments Board.
As there may be some
doubt as to the identity of
your Appointments Board

tive the following is the
