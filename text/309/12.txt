What the City press have said about the new
computer service now avaiiahle to students.
" I think it is a bit of a scandal that life assurance salesmen in this country require neither specialist qualifi-
cations nor a licence.
So I hope, and Quotel believes that more business will be directed to expert brokers and away from
amateurs, well meaning or otherwise.
(Daily Mail, June 1971)
" The system has long been needed in the industry, where the quality of service provided by brokers varies
considerably."
(Daily Express, May 1971)
"Quotel seems likely to show the public the need for securing properly qualified advice. Since for the first
time a complete analysis of the market will be readily available. "
(Planned Savings, June 1971)
" So anyone who wants to be as certain as possible what the companies offer should ask his broker if he is a
Quotel subscriber and then put the new service to the test. "
(Financial Times, May 1971)
"It must also be remembered that it is far more important for the person to have the right policy rather
than get one at the right rate.
The management of Quotel have shown their appreciation of this point and have announced that the service
is only being made available to people who are able to interpret the information given. Thus, while it seems
likely that insurance broking will thrive as a result of this development, the growth will only take place
among the specialist brokers."
