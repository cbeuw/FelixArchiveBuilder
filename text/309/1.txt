IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION 24 February 1972 No. 309
A W e e k l y
Felix?
Those of you who remember my first editorial of the
year, few in number no doubt, will recall my feelings as
regards the restructuring of I.C.U. publications. Basic-
ally I asked for the numerous diverse publications
which I.C.U. producer such as I.C. News, the constituent
college broadsheets, Snapping Jaws, etc. to all be
combined into one good publication which would be
worth the money it would cost and probably be cheaper
than the total cost of all the other publications anyway.
To my joy there is now a positive hope that all of this
could come to pass.
Last Monday a motion went
before council, proposed by
either Rob Armitage or Dave
Hobman, probably the former,
suggesting that Felix be made
weekly and incorporate other
ICU publications. Unfortunately
at the time of going to press
the above mentioned council
meeting had not taken place and
so I am unable to tell you the
outcome of the proposal.
Whilst the motion appeared to
have extensive support through-
out IC council members before
it was proposed, it has many
more far reaching consequences
than I think the majority of
council members had realised.
It is my purpose to put these
forward at the council meeting
so as the students of the Col-
lege may be similarly enlighten-
ed and so be placed in the posi-
tion to judge the issue for them-
selves and forcefully voice their
opinions if they feel its neces-
sary, I would also like to put
•.hern forward here.
Firstly, the Editor of a weekly
Felix must be sabbatical. There
are many other officials of ICU
who will feel that their position
should be made sabbatical be-
fore the Editor of Felix, but
there are not many who can
claim that to make their post
sabbatical would be an invest-
ment. A weekly Felix must be
able to be on the newstands
within at most 48 hours of
leaving for press. Whilst prin-
ters who can handle this kind of
work would need to be investi-
gated further printing costs per
issue cannot be expected to be
much less than £100. Multipli-
cation by 31 produces a large
amount of money. This money
could only be recovered by ex-
tensive advertising, which can
only be obtained by means of a
great deal of time consuming
work. The present annual in-
comes to Felix from advertising
is approximately £350. A little
thought will soon show that the
cost of £465 per annum for a
sabbatical Editor will soon be
replenished. There are, of
course, two other important
considerations (a) that no-one
would be Editor unless it were
a sabbatical post, as too much
work would be involved, (b)
The content of Felix must be
improved by a sabbatical
Editor.
Secondly, we must examine
the differences between the pro-
posed new Felix and the pre-
sent one. At present I do not

feel that for the purpose it
serves in ICU Felix warrants its
annual grant of £800. It does not
manage to include most of the
important Union news and is
too understaffed to function as
a useful news medium in any
sense. Indeed it is little more
than an interesting magazine.
By the same token none of the
other I.C.U. publications is really
worth the money it costs either
and some of them not even the
paper they are written on. If
we put all our eggs into one
basket then we will be having a
paper worth having. For the
first time we will have a medium
in I.C.U.
I cannot emphasise too
strongly the importance of
these proposals. The only alter-
native to this campaign to re-
move the reams of rubbishy
print from our waste bins is the
proposed scheme for STOIC.
However the only decision here
is to want to get your message
to 3,000 people or to 200. What
I am trying to build is a medium
for all. Please give it your sup-
port. Write to your President
now. The issue comes before
Publications Board next week.

Without doubt, the Union meeting of two weeks ago
was one of the most important to have occurred this
term. The advance publicity was better this time, with
the issue of no-confidence in the Hon. Sec. being high-
lighted in Felix, this article undoubtedly influencing the
vote later in the proceedings.
This, together with the pos-
sibility of money being voted
from Union funds to the miners,
must have brought a consider-
able number of those people
who came. There were about
450 present, many of whom
seemed enthusiastically com-
mitted to a particular view-point
and had only come to vote for
or against the relevant issues.
As a result of this the order
on the agenda was changed to
allow discussion of the miners
case first and then the vote of
no-confidence. These changes
were vigourously opposed by
the President and eventually a
vote had to be taken to settle
the issue.
Before these motions could
be discussed, however, the elec-
tion of delegates to the next
NUS conference had to be con-
cluded. D. Amos and R. Armi-
tage were automatically elected
as the two newcomers but a
vote was necessary to decide
upon the remaining four. Six
people had put their names for-
ward, these being P. Corbybn,
D, Hobman, J. McCullough, J.
Murliss, P. Ransom, O Shep-
pard. Each was allowed to talk
for a few minutes on why he
should be allowed to go.
Piers was concerned that
NUS might back down from
their policy on Union Autonomy
and felt that the fight against
the government must be con-
tinued. He also rejected the alle-
gation by the President that he
had spoken against Union man-
dates-
Dave Hobman was principally
concerned with the right of
education for everyone and was
equally concerned that Mr. Cor-
byn should not be allowed to go
as he had broken mandates in
the past with every possibility
of him continuing to do so in
the future.
Chris Sheppard, who sudden-
ly seems to have appeared out
of the blue, wanted to go delib-
erately unspecialised so that he
could talk on any issue that
occurred. Too often, he said,
did delegates find themselves
with nothing to say when their
particular topic had been drop-
ped.
The result of the ballot taken
at the meeting resulted in P.
Corbyn and P. Ransom being
dropped, however, it appears
that Mr. Corbyn is again going
to appeal against the voting sys-
tem.
After this came the item
which everyone had been wait-
ing for, the motion concerning
the miners strike. The version
proposed by the executive ask-
ed for a day of solidarity to be
arranged and for a collection
to be made.
Mr. Jack Dunn, the general
secretary of the NUM in Kent,
had come to give information
about the strike and proceeded
to give a lengthy speech on the
subject. This went over fairly
well and the general impression
was that people felt sympathy
for the cause without wanting
to use it as a weapon against
the government.
Piers Corbyn soon found this
out when he proposed his
amendment which had such
phrases as "victory for the min-
ers strike means that the Gov-
ernments 7 per cent pay norm
will be broken". In order to
show solidarity with the cause,
he was convinced that the
Union must pay some money
(£100) into the strike fund. This,
in particular, was vigorously
shouted down.
Pete Jenkins opposed the
amendment on grounds that is
was dangerous for student un-
ions to use their money for poli-
tical causes, and that the money
should be spent on students
only. If anything any money

should be purely on a voluntary
basis.
When the vote came, the
amendment was defeated much
to the delight of the voters and
the President, who allowed a
brief smile to cross his face.
The less radical main motion
was passed by a large majority.
And now we come to the
sorry tale of alleged corruption.
Mr. Amos started off the pro-
ceedings by accusing Felix of
being highly inaccurate in its
account of the affair. He then
related an almost identical
story.
The Hon. Sec. then told his
side of the story of which a
good summary can be found in
the last issue.
An attempt was made to get
the subject dropped but this was
voted down by the meeting.
Most people were getting very
confused by the uncertainty of
everyone involved. After all, it
surely shows that something is
wrong when the proposers of
the motion try to get it by-
passed.
Eventually the inevitable hap-
pened and the motion was de-

feated almost unanimously.
Chris Sheppard then proposed
a vote of censure on the three
originators, D. Amos, B. Dar-
ling and P. Jowitt, which was
carried by a majority of 60.
Obscured in the mass of ir-
relevant detail a few important
points can be found. For the
first time we have seen an ac-
tive demonstration of the voice
of the majority at I.C. in defeat-
ing the suggested payment to
the NUM. I am sure that many
people made a deliberate effort
to come just to vote against this.
It would be an achievement if
they continued to lend their
support but, by their very nature
it is unlikely.
There is now little doubt that
Mr. Amos and company made
one of their biggest blunders in
suggesting that D. Hobman was
corrupt and we do not apolo-
gise for making an issue of the
case.
