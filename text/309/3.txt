The recent appearance of the I.C.
team on "University Challenge" has
sparked off a phenomenal public reac-
tion. One of the team received fan mail
from a girl in Harrogate, another got an
offer from a male in Wales, and yet
another received two hairgrips from a
lady pensioner in Edinburgh.
A popular subwarden, it appears, has
been using his pass keys rather too
freely. When going to question a resi-
dent about a rubber cheque at eleven
o'clock at night, on receiving no answer
proceeded to unlock the door . . . re-
vealing the man in question and his girl-
friend in bed. The subwarden, ignoring
all this, proceeded to question him on
the cheque!!
We hear that the Hand of G o d has
dealt unfortunately with the famed Meth-
soc Hot Dog Emporium. It appears that,
whilst wheeling the aforesaid stand
across Exhibition Road, that a gas cy-
linder fell off—upon which a passing car
succeeded in impaling its automatic
transmission, rendering the latter use-
less. It transpires that the car was un-
insured. Presumably a dilemma for all
concerned.
The rag Carnival Procession made
£1000—more details see article oppo-
site.
Pete Jenkins denounced giving mon-
ey to the miners from Union Funds the
other week, on the grounds that we
should spend it on union activities first.
It's interesting to note that Pete is a
member of Gliding Club, I.C's. most ex-
pensive club, both to join and run.
Our Crimsoc correspondent reports
that College Block was very easy to
break into during the Rag Ball.
It is almost certain that Ents is now
out of the red. This is despite David
Bowie not being a sell-out—but French
Television turned up, and, for a fee,
filmed the proceedings.

W e ' r e q u i c k — W e ' r e e f f i c i e n t
letter
In November you print-
ed a frantic and pathetic-
ally illiterate letter from
Messrs Stock and Brading,
in which they gloated over
the postponement of Mor-
phy Day. In the light of the
recent non-reappearance
of this festival I feel that
some reply is needed.
Their argument that
Morphyness breeds public
disapproval is not unreas-
onable—but Morphy is the
exception, and anyway the
bulk of the public FAR
prefer a slightly hearty I.C.
character to an Ultra-left-
wing L.S.E. man. When a
College starts playing
'More Revolutionary Than
Thou' the public is scared.
But my main objection
to their insidious letter is
the way in which it signi-
fies the thin end of the
wedge. This year Morphy
dies, next year Regent
Street Tiddly-Winks, then
. . . etc. . . , which, in a
generation and World in
which humourlessness and
dull uniformity run ram-
pant, is a tragic loss to
civilisation.
SO, C O M R A D E S , do not
be put off by these Politi-
cal Killjoys—be silly, be
friendly, be witty. Life is
too short to be serious all
the time.
Yours, with luv, and in
silliness,
Bobby Shatter.
(Secretary to
Mauf E. Day)
