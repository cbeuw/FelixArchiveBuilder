Down with Insurance!
Every Insurance advertiser recommends you to buy Insurance because your age and status
will save you a lot of money over the coming years. (You'll be buying a house soon and
Life Assurance is an attractive investment as well as a way of protecting your family).
It is also a fact that Life Assurance rates for Students have been going down over the years,
but with almost 200 Companies (each with many Plans) YOUR BEST BUY has been difficult
to find, . . .
Now you have TWO excellent guides —
^ • O n e is a new innovation: the QUOTEL computers which will indicate YOUR BEST BUY at
the press of a button.
"The computer will be fed with details of premiums and policies from all the major Life
Assurance Offices in the country. The information will be updated daily."
(Daily Telegraph May 28th 1971.)
The other is the most experienced firm of independent Brokers in the Student field, who have
access to these Computers, and have the qualifications necessary to analyse the print-out
comparisons and the facts behind them.
The BEST B U Y in Life Assurance is a highly individual and important matter and we at
Harrison's treat it as such. Moreover our advisory services are completely free.
At all times we bear very much in mind that you are likely to be living on a grant. All our
plans are designed to reduce your outlay
so DOWN WITH INSURANCE PREMIUMS and UP WITH YOUR BENEFITS
through professional teamwork!
