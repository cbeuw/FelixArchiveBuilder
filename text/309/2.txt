9.30 a.m., Saturday 12th
February. Falmouth's float
saw the torrential drizzle,
turned over and went back
to his teddy bear.
Soon a miscellany of
lorries had converged on
Q.E.C. to finish building
the floats and to sample
the wares of Scottish and
Newcastle who provided
not only a lorry but a fine
barrel of Tartan. Here the
enforced branch who were
to be our escorts first
made their presence felt—
by consuming a goodly
percentage of the afore-
mentioned Tartan. S U K
Rag Chairman Armitage
was seen to 'buy' the
policeman a round — of
free Tartan. Is this Charity?
Meanwhile Dave Roberts
of Q.E.C., the procession
organiser, was dashing
about checking the floats.
West London College were
impersonating a Christmas
tree, whilst the one articu-
lated truck was showing
Community Action M a n '
(x. London only) starring
Mick, Male and Perry.
Linstead Hall produced a
Viking Ship, a seemingly
unlimited supply of Fos-
ter's which must have fal-
len off the back of their
bar, and half-a-hundred-
weight of flour, some of
which very soon attacked
Chairman Armflutter (a
direct hit) and John Mor-
gan's Lanchester (about
twenty direct hits). R C S
produced computer out-
put, alluminium foil and a
drum and fire extinguisher
solo from John Higgs.
E.C. had a bikini, trans-
vestite nurses and operat-
ing theatre, subtitled
'Syringe Binge'—a com-
ment on their hobbies?
Dramsoc displayed the
Rag Queen, Debating Soc-
iety produced a Sprite.
After a legal argument
over its magic disappear-
ing tax disc, Clem joined
Bo, and Watney-Man and
Young's breweries sent
their prize-winning drays
whose magnificent horses
which outdrank everyone
else.
The procession moved
off only half an hour late
surrounded by large piles
of rag magazines and col-
lecting cans disguised as
students. Progress down
Kensington High Street
was not quite slow enough
to stop passing traffic, but
just past the Albert Hall a
gorilla and can were seen
proceeding in the wrong
direction down the oncom-
ing fast lane aided and
abetted by a large, very
feminine cat wearing red
clogs. In fact the gorilla
continued playing with
pussy all day.
All available cars were
cajoled and threatened
until their occupants paid
up, including the tailback
in Hyde Park underpass.
After several impromptu
halts whilst the hard-drink-
ing horses relieved them-
selves (likewise six
policemen shoulder-to-
shoulder in Sloane Square
gutters) the procession
finally ground to a halt out-
side Sidney Street's public
convenience. These stops
should be planned in
future. Once under way
again, the IC and Q E C
Rag Chairmen were lost to
view, re-emerging way past
Harrods armed with brim-
ming pint pots—one of
which went to the artic
driver, already surrounded
by empties.
On arrival back a Q E C
Linstead hurled in all
directions, and a wooden
keg of Young's bitter was
attacked with gusto.
Martin Black's hat and
other trophies changed
hands. It is rumoured that
later that afernoon IC's
Rag Chairman failed to
drink a yard and was de-
posited, dissolved in
QEC's pond.
Thanks to collectors,
drivers, transport firms
and very good-humoured
police, about £300 was
raised. HYPERSEUD

Dinner
with Enoch
The Place: Smith Square, London — The Time: 18.53 hrs. on Friday,
February 11th, 1972. Everything was going according to plan. We
knocked on the door and it was opened a few inches.
Within minutes the Central
Office of the greatest political
party in the country would be
reduced to a heap of rubble.
Once inside it would simply be
a matter of lighting the fuse and
beating a hasty retreat. Unfor-
tunately, the best laid plans . . .
You find it hard to believe?
Why should it be anything but
the truth? (apart from the fact
that I am writing it). For all you
know this article could have
been called from the charred
remains of a secret manuscript
smuggled out of a holiday camp
somewhere west of Hounslow.
The Friday before last the
London University Conservative
Association (LUCA to its
friends) held its annual dinner
at the House of Commons with
Enoch Powell, a vice-president
of LUCA, as the guest speaker.
Apparently they have the
second largest Conservative
Society in London University;
considering this it was not very
well represented at the dinner,
most people were either from

Kings or were law students. The
three-course meal was pleasant
but not impressive although it
was a definite improvement on
Mooney (what isn't, you may
well ask). After the meal the
chairman of LUCA proposed a
toast to the government which
was replied to "on behalf of
Her Majesty's Government" by
Enoch Powell who seemed to
prefer the idea that he was
speaking on behalf of the Con-
servative Party.
He then launched on his ex-
pected attack on the govern-
ment. The "in" subject now is
of course the Common Market
but this was just an excuse to
accuse the government of
using immoral pressures to
ensure a majority in the vote on
the Second Reading of the Com-
mon Market Bill on Thursday
17th.
"We all carry with us a little
dust from the rungs by which
we have ascended. The Prime
Minister was once a Chief Whip,
a very efficient Chief Wbip; and
there is a sense in which it is
true to say that 'Once a Chief
Whip, always a Chief Whip".
Mr. Powell went on to say that
nothing but the full-hearted com-
ment of this nation could author-
ise British entry into the Com-
munity. "Its place cannot be
taken by a sum majority in the
House of Commons engineered
by intimidation and shady deal-
ing . . . what is to be feared is
that in the process a discredit
not easily removed again will be
left sticking to the government,
to this Party, and to the House
of Commons itself."
It is interesting to read this
in light of the vote on Thursday
17th, when the Government had
a majority of only eight. How-
ever, those who saw Mr. Roy
Mellish, the Labour Chief Whip
on television after the vote will
no doubt agree that the only
discredit has been left sticking
to the Labour Party who saw it
as an excuse to overthrow the
Government whatever the cost
to the country.
