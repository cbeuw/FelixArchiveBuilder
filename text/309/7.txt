Gutteridge Cup W i n
Hockey EDITORIAL
On Wednesday, 9th Feb-
ruary I.C. 1st XV played
Goldsmiths in the long
awaited 2nd round cup
game and emerged victori-
ous by 13 points to 9.
I.C. started strongly but
found themselves 3 points
adrift when the Goldsmiths
fly-half kicked a penalty
after an infringement. How-
ever the deficit was soon
made up after a superb
peel, when I.C. were aw-
arded a penalty. Chris
Flanagan, thinking quickly,
fed James who sent Jim
Hunt over in the corner.
The conversion failed,
needless to say. I.C. press-
ed strongly for the rest of
the first half and should
have scored on numerous
occasions but the final
pass always seemed to go
astray and as the score at
half-time stood at 4 points
to 3 in I.C's favour.
The second half opened
as the first, with I.C. on
the attack and soon in-
creased that when James
kicked a penalty. I.C. con-
tinued to press and were
suitably rewarded when
from a line-out the ball
was well won by the pack
and Chris Flanagan sent
out a superb pass giving
the I.C. backs room in
which to move. The ball
moved between the cen-
tres and John Hughes,
timing his run from full-
back to perfection made
the initial break to send
Phil Lofts over for a try.
James converted.
Goldsmiths came back
into the game and scored
a late try and the final few
minutes were tense but
I.C. held out and face
Kings in the semi final.

I.C. Beats Bradford
in Close Match
Just before the start of
the first race, our captain
told us: "Pair off before
the start if you can". Un-
fortunately, on the start
gun Mike Martin and crew
J. Horsfall were nowhere
to be seen, and so we
started at a disadvantage.
After some devious sailing
by the rest of our team, we
managed to sail into a win-
ning combination. Howev-
er, our captain had not,
for reasons better known
to himself, fully explained
the exact location of the
finishing line and the op-
position demanded a re-
sail.
The following race did
not produce any better a
start—it would appear that
someone's starting watch
was malfunctioning or
something. After a bit of
true team - racing we
managed to gain a 2, 3, 6,
from 2, 5, 6 at the first
mark which unfortunately
was not a winning combin-
ation.
The third race started
after lunch and the three
I.C. boats were all in the
vicinity of the line, but even
so Bradford had the better
start. S. Bascoe, crewed
by Paul Jones, produced
some useful sailing for a
change, and helped Peter
Waite and Mike Martin to
sail through two Bradford
boats to give a 2, 3, 4, at
the final leeward mark.
The leading Bradford boat
then had an impossible
task to hold all three I.C.
boats back and eventually
sacrificed his first position
in an attempt to help his
team-mates to sail into a
winning combination. The
final result was 2, 3, 6 and
1, 2, 4 to give I.C. the
match.
I should like to say that
I.C. are very desperate to
attract keen crews to sail
in weekend matches, and
anyone who would like to
be considered should see
M. Martin in Keogh 266.
R.C.S. Shoot Guilds
On Sunday, 6th Febru-
ary, the annual big-bore
rifle match between R.C.S.
and Guilds took place at
Bisley. It was planned for
teams of eight, best six
scores to count, but be-
cause of the horrible wea-
ther only five of each
Scores were as follows:
side turned up, some of
whom were very late. We
eventually started at 300
yards, managed one detail,
sandwiches and a pint.
After lunch, we finish-
ed off at 300, then mob-
ed back to 600 yards.
Firing only seven shots at
each distance, we still
continued firing until dark-
ness produced some very
wild shots—bad luck Paul
Jordan and Mick Ander-
son for being in the last
detail! We returned a be-
draggled lot, R.C.S. hav-
ing won by 13 points out
out of 350.

After five barren years
I.C. hockey club has again
reached the final of the
U.L Cup and play U.C. at
Motspur Park on March
8th. In the previous rounds
we disposed of King's Col-
lege Hospital 9-0, Royal
Free Hospital 1-0, and met
Barts Hospital in the semi-
final.
As our only defeat by a
college side this season
was by Barts a tough
match was expected. On a
wet but true surface at
Motspur Park the game
started with both sides
pressing for early suprem-
acy. After 20 minutes I.C.
gradually took control and
John Astley converted this
pressure into a deserved
lead. A brilliant save by
their goalkeeper from a
Steve Tucker flick stopped
I.C. from going into a 2-0
lead by half-time.
Playing downhill in the
second half a short corner
by Steve Tucker put I.C.
further into the lead. Our
success was short lived
and after 20 minutes of
sustained attacking Barts
We have been hearing about the invincibility of I.C.
on the sports field where the trend (hardly a trend,
more a fact of life) is continuing as far as Men's
Sport is concerned. Unfortunately, the Ladies' Hockey
Teams were unable to beat U.C., going down 3-2 in a
very close match. Considering that U.C. has about five
times as many girls as us, the result should be no
surprise but our girls have constantly over the years
turned out performances far better than can be related
to the numbers available for selection.
The Rugby and Football Clubs have reached the
semi-finals and the Hockey Club the final of the U.L.
Cup. The Hockey final takes place on Wednesday,
March 8th at Motspur Park against U.C., when support
will be welcome.
Following last issue's remarks about mismanagement
of fixtures, the football semi-final at Q.M.C. against
Goldsmith's was called off after some peculiar dither-
ing by the opposition.
In an internal game of football, feeling ran high when
Guilds beat R.C.S. in the Tech. Cup and so retained
the trophy. The score was 1-0 and one outstanding
black eye!
scored twice to draw level.
In the final few minutes
I.C. hit back and after a
goal mouth scramble were
awarded to a penalty flick.
Though the goalkeeper
saved Mick Barton's flick
a technical foul resulted in
a goal being awarded from
which Barts never recov-
ered.

Ist XI in Semi-Finals
Concurrent with the match, I.C. Rifle Club held their individual Club Champion-
ship. Mary Mitchell won the N.R.A. Donegal! Medal, tieing with Richard Kenching-
ton at 67 points, but beating him with the better score (all in the Bullseye) at 600
yards.
After a rather undeserv-
ed draw in the quarter
final of the ULU Cup at
Harlington, I.C. 1st XI took
on Thames Polytechnic in
the replay away from
home. The game marked
a break in tradition, when
Steve Wells—a ULU play-
er—was included in tthe
team as a sweeper. This
was necessitated by a late
injury to one of the team's
strikers. The big contrast
between the two teams
was the fast direct break
from defence of the I.C.
team, as against the pretty
midfield approach work of
Thames. As the game
wore on, I.C. were too fre-
quent off target with their
shooting. A very good 5-
man move ended with
Willcock shooting just
over from 20 yards. Intel-
ligent over-lapping by
Worthington and Maslin
added weight to the at-
tack, and Kelly, Milne and
Smith all tested the goal-
keeper with long range
shots, but he seemed in a
more confident mood than
in recent matches and af-
ter much frustration the
teams turned round with
still no goals having been
scored.
In the second half the
pattern was much the
same and apart from one
chance falling to the
Thames centre half, Whit-
ham was very rarely called
on to show his work. How-
ever he did make a very
good diving save from a
20 yard shot a few minutes
from the end of the game,
which must not go unmen-
tioned.
The stalemate ended
after 30 minutes of the
second half, when after
one of Richards many
piercing raids into the
opponents' territory, Fryer
picked up a loose ball in-
side the box, evaded a
tackle and rounded the
goalkeeper before slipping
the ball home from a nar-
row angle to score the
goal which gave I.C. vic-
tory and a place in the
semi-final against Gold-
smiths.
The Hyde Park relay shaping up last Saturday. The
field included all nationalities.
