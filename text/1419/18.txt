Shotgun. They’re back and this time
they are better armed then Arnie in
Terminator 2, so watch out freshers-
particularly if you happen to be made
of liquid metal and/or a twat. (Sahil)
How to play:
It’s quite simple, all numbers are in a
cell and must be surrounded with a
corresponding number lines. Lines
cannot split and there can only be
one continuous line. Any cells with no
numbers can have any number of lines.
Look at the solution above for help.

Union banterings through the eyes of Love Machine

Friday 12 December 2008 felix
Hopping mad. Livid, early twenties.
Missing right shoe. Last seen
Wednesday night at the union. If
found, please return before injury
results.
Travel warning. A ruggers boy
returned from China with more than
just some holiday snaps and knock-
off DVDs. Apparently, all traces of
the Grand Pox have been removed,
and his girlfriend doesn’t mind. We
can all learn something from this;
the true meaning of “in sickness and
in health” and the importance of the
blood test.
Confused. The extravaganza that
was Choir & ICSO’s musical account
of Babylon’s debauchery last Saturday
seems to have been too much for
some performers. The poor boy
(less King Belshazzar, more Queen
of Babylon) made repeated face-
touching attempts on an unsuspecting
flame-haired lady. Was it the stories
of willing servant-girls that fuelled
this heterosexual episode, or have
we misunderstood some sort of Irish
tradition? All we know is that one
distraught King of Thieves intends
to return the Babylonian beauty to
Sherwood forest and reform his band
of merry men.
Jumper mystery solved. Yes, we are
beginning to tire of moaning about
the grey jumper just as much as you
are sick of reading about it. Ladies
beware, this particular jumper has
unanticipated and curious effects.
Only last week was the wearer spotted
with a tiny blonde, and this week he
had a tall brunette positively fawning
over him. Now we understand your
reluctance to venture into alternative
apparel. Go forth and sow.
Note to Geologists: Oh my God, if
he had better shoes I probably would
have slept with him by now. We
recommend investing in a quality pair
from Church’s – made to last well into
your dirty-old-man phase.
Respect. So often has the drunken
shoes-off-watch-me-dance failed to
achieveitsdesiredresult(er,macking),
that we have to give the old hats-off
to a lady far too smartly dressed for
dB’s on a Wednesday. Yes we’ve seen
you before, and you do only have the
one routine. But you were more than
successful in finding a tall, dark and
handsome dirty dancing partner, and
your grinding away into the early
hours has to be envied.
Pissed. A dubious wet patch, ample
enough to fill a small to medium
sized paddling pool, was left in an
unsuspecting person’s bed following
the rugby dinner on Saturday Night.
There is no wonder she made such a
hasty exit. I’ve been here, it’s actually rather quaint. Floor was a bit sticky though.
Mentalist Maze
We have maze! Do it for England. But you may find that it will affect FUCWIT a
touch more. Send answers to the usual address, entries with £5 attached will score
triple points. Mabey. (If enough people answer we will use it for FUCWIT- Ed.)

Hello there! Now that I have you all in one place, let me just do some small
‘housekeeping’ business. There have been mistakes this term. A lot of them. That
will change. Hopefully. The frequency of your responses will hopefully remain
the same. Good luck with this week’s massive offering, have a fantastic Christmas
and New Year, and congratulations to Shotgun for correctly answering both last
week’s Quickie and Cryptic.
