felix Film countdown to Christmas
On behalf of everyone at Film felix: Merry Christmas! Have a Happy New Year and we hope you continue
to read us in the new term!
24th
The Muppet Christmas Carol
Songs, Muppets and Michael Caine
as Scrooge: what more could you ask
for? Watching this on Christmas Eve
will make you think of the real reason
for Christmas, as well as give you a
laugh (especially when Tiny Tim gets
what he deserves) and will make you
smile and feel merry. Everyone seems
to love this film and it is clear to see
why - Kermit and his gang give this
overdone Dicken’s story something
extra, and the festive cheese level is
extremely high, without being too
sickening.
1st
Die Hard
Start December off with a bang - lit-
erally - with Bruce Willis killing Ger-
man terrorists atop a massive skyscrap-
er. Filled to the brim with Christmas
references - snow, Santa and annoying
relatives - you can sit back and laugh as
good ol’ John McClane blasts his way
through villains in bloody and hilari-
ous ways. Who can forget Alan Rick-
man’s brilliant demise at the end? And
then once the carnage is over, we hear
‘Let it Snow! Let it Snow! Let it Snow!’
play over the end credits! Awesome!
2nd
The Associate
Whoopi Goldberg plays a business-
woman whose partner steals all of her
ideas and then gets her promotion,
because he is a man. The only way she
can succeed? By pretending to go into
commerce with a white businessman!
Hilarious and sometimes touching,
this film is guaranteed to put a smile
on your face - especially when Gold-
berg dresses up as her ‘associate’ - and
you won’t believe the results!
3rd
It’s A Wonderful Life
Possibly the most depressing film
ever made, for those of you who haven’t
seen it and want to watch something a
bit more upsetting, then this is the film
for you. Just make sure you don’t watch
the final uplifting 5 minutes if you
want to stay depressed for the rest of
your life. But if you do want Christmas
cheer, make sure you do watch the end,
or there will be plenty of heads in the
oven this year!
4th
The Back To The Future Trilogy
For some reason, I always feel Christ-
massy and/or happy when I watch
these films. Can Marty McFly (Michael
J Fox) save his own life when he is sent
back in time? And what will happen
when he goes into the future? Or into
the old West? Possibly the best trilogy
ever made!
5th
Any or all of the Wallace and
Gromit films
Any of these will do, or if you must,
you could watch all of them. They
may not be set at Christmas but they
bring back the spirit of childhood and
innocence!
6th
While You Were Sleeping
What happens when lonely tollbooth
operator Lucy (Sandra Bullock) saves
a man’s life, only to be thought to be
his fiancée at the hospital? She gains
a family, friends, and also a love inter-
est. This rom-com has some genuinely
funny moments - mainly involving
the family she adopts (“These mashed
potatoes are so creamy!”) and it re-
ally does encapsulate everything about
Christmas: family, friends and love.
7th
Mary Poppins
Oh come on! This had to be here!
Everyone loves Mary Poppins! This
isn’t set at Christmas either, but who
cares? What would Christmas be like
without ‘A Spoonful of Sugar’?
8th
White Christmas (1954)
For those of you who love happy
endings and cheesy musicals this is
for you - but for everyone else: reach
for your bucket, as this musical packs
as much sap in as is humanly possible.
With many memorable songs you can
sing along to, including ‘White Christ-
mas’ and something about counting
your blessings instead of sheep (urgh!)
everyone enjoys a happy ending in this
film, even though it is about the Sec-
ond World War.
9th
Jumanji/ Beethoven/ Any film
you watched as a child
I remember watching these films
when I was really young - and I loved
them! Relieve your childhood by
watching something YOU cherished as
a child!
10th
Home Alone 1 & 2
These films are AMAZING. They
have everything in them about Christ-
mas, as well as Macaulay Culkin before
he… well… you know… it hurts think-
ing about. Anyway, I personally prefer
the second one, Lost In New York, be-
cause it really shoves Christmas in your
face and has a more funny and violent
way of the villains getting hurt, as well
as a Toy Shop and that bit in the hotel
when he pretends his Dad is a gangster.
Just ignore the bird woman.
11th
Little Women (1994)
It’s snowy and cold, and in post-Civil
war America, Jo (Winona Ryder) and
her sisters struggle to make life for
themselves and everyone else a happy
place. Christmassy, life affirming, as
well as sad, I think everyone remem-
bers the horrible sister Amy, the piano,
and the saddest part of all when we re-
alise that Beth isn’t gonna make it…
12th
Groundhog Day
Though technically nothing to do
with Christmas, it still has a snowy at-
mosphere and someone learns life les-
sons about love. Also this film is just
so darn brilliant I could watch it every
day of the year anyway. When anchor-
man Phil (Bill Murray) gets stuck in the
same day, will he use it to his advantage
or will he be driven insane? And will
he ever be able to get the woman of his
dreams Rita (Andie MacDowell)?
13th
Miracle on 34th Street (1947 or
1994)
If this film doesn’t make you believe
in Santa, then nothing will. Father
Christmas gets taken to court. Every-
one wins (in every way possible). This
film is the equivalent to a big hunk of
stinky Cheddar - extremely cheesy.
14th
Black Christmas (2006)
Getting sick of being happy? Then
this Christmas themed horror film is
for you! A psycho escapes from a men-
tal institution and returns to his former
home - now a sorority house. Cue
beautiful and really sexy women being
killed in disgusting ways - eyeballs are
plucked, heads roll and Christmas trees
are decorated with body parts - liter-
ally. I just love this film - it is brilliant at
being truly foul in every way - but still
makes you feel Christmassy.
15th
The Snowman (1982)
[the following contains spoilers]
Ignoring the song about Walking In
The Air, this film is really depressing,
and is ultimately what Christmas is all
about. When the Snowman melts at
the end, I think all of our hopes and
dreams melt with him (sniff…). But the
film is still great!
16th
The Lion, The Witch and the
Wardrobe (1988 BBC Version
or 2005)
Finally - something with a bit of re-
ligion in! But it still has Santa, talking
beavers and an enchanted wardrobe
- a magical Christmas treat! I would
personally watch both versions back
to back - the BBC one with buck-
toothed Lucy is just brilliant, but to
get good graphics watch the modern
one, as there is only so much you can
take of flying cartoons mixed in with
real actors before you laugh uncontrol-
lably. Although saying that, the wolf in
the old one still scares me - especially
when Edmund goes to visit the witch
at her castle and the wolf jumps out.
And how happy was I when that stupid
fawn got turned to stone - it’s a shame
he comes back to life…
17th
An Affair To Remember/ Sleep-
less in Seattle
The first of my back–to-back mara-
thon! I would advise all men to watch
these with a female present. An Af-
fair To Remember is about a couple
that meet on a cruise ship and fall in
love. But I don’t think the male popula-
tion get this film - it reduces women
to quivering wrecks and leaves men
confused as to why. Women must be
present when men watch this so they
can explain (but I wouldn’t recom-
mend a man watching this unless he
was forced to anyway). The first film
is mentioned a lot in the classic Sleep-
less in Seattle - will Meg Ryan and Tom
Hanks ever meet so that they can fall
in love?
18th
The Shop Around The Corner/
You’ve Got Mail
You’ve Got Mail is a modern remake
of Shop Around The Corner, so they
both have the same story. Two people
fall in love through letters (or email) but
hate each other in real life. The original
is more depressing - it has a suicide at-
tempt in it, so for all of you who want
something that is a bit ‘gritty’ but still
has a happy ending - this is for you.
You’ve Got Mail reunites Meg Ryan
and Tom Hanks to comical effect.
19th
Stardust
Awesome film. It is modern, but I’m
sure it will make its way onto many
people’s Christmas rotations. Set in
a fantasy land next to the real world,
a young boy has to catch a star, who
is now a woman, for the girl of his
dreams, only to be chased by everyone
for it. An all-star cast and great script
make this film sparkle.
20th
Call Me Claus
Every 200 years, Santa must be re-
placed by a new person - this time it is
Lucy (Whoopi Goldberg), a workohol-
ic TV producer who hates Christmas.
How will she cope when Santa tells her
it is her destiny to be the next Father
Christmas? Low budget, but Whoopi
always delivers.
21st
A Disney film of your choice
Christmas is nearly there - treat your-
self to a Disney classic! I would proba-
bly choose Bedknobs and Broomsticks
or The Sword In The Stone - but eve-
ryone has their own favourites. How
about Toy Story 1 or 2?
22nd
Santa Claus The Movie
This film is shown every single year
on TV- and I’m not sure why! You ei-
ther love it or hate it - so watch it to
be entertained or watch it and laugh at
Dudley Moore and John Lithgow in all
their 80’s glory.
23rd
Watch something religious
Well ‘tis the season - right? Whether
or not you believe it’s always good to
see something about the real meaning
of Christmas. The Nativity Story is a
good self-explanatory starting point,
or you could watch The Passion of The
Christ to get into the story a little bit
further on…
A
ny excuse to watch more
films is always a good
excuse and with all the
time off we get at this
time of the year, Christ-
mas is such a great time to watch as
many films as possible! But just in case
you aren’t sure which festive flicks are
worth your time, I decided to make
an advent calendar full of fun films
all about Christmas (or they at least
evoke what Christmas is all about). So
join an internet film rental site, get to
your local library, go to HMV or beg
borrow and steal as many films as you
can and lock yourself into your house
(with ample food supplies of course) so
that you can begin your festive movie
marathon instead of doing essays, lab
reports, reading, and visiting dull rela-
tives! Because, after all, isn’t that the
real spirit of Christmas?
