e all feel like foie
gras at the mo-
ment. It’s the party
season, which un-
doubtedly means
attending multiple turkey-worshipping
sessions, scoffing canapés as if your life
depends on it and consuming more
than your fair share of port and other
festive beverages. Just like those poor
geese we are stuffing our bellies to the
point of discomfort and stretching our
stomachs in anticipation of The Big
One on Christmas Day. Why do we do
it to ourselves?
I suppose such feasting and over-
indulgence is not a modern concept at
all. At the slightest hint of their supe-
riority, the Ancients feasted for days
on end on luxurious morsels and dor-
mice while planning the building of a
large phallic monument to themselves.
Nothing’s changed then.
This Saturday, our flat is holding its
2nd annual Beef Wellington Evening.
It’s that one night of the year where
Asda Smart Price gets abandoned and
replaced by the most expensive cut of
meat our butcher can offer. As a pre-
cursor to this feasting and gluttony
I had to cleanse my conscience and
ease my lapsed-Catholic guilt by buy-
ing multiple gifts for relatives from
Oxfam Unwrapped. I couldn’t afford
to buy my step-dad a bog or a llama so
he will have to settle with a home im-
provement kit for a disaster area [and
hopefully take the HINT]. My god-
daughter-niece hybrid will receive 100
School Dinners for African children,
not Turbo Princess Barbie. Conscience
cleaned. Job done.
As a closet vegetarian, I would dearly
like to include more veggie recipes and
articles in the food section. Reader, if
you swing the same way as me please
do get in touch with ideas. I don’t
know how to come out! I think it would
ruin my relationship with my boy-
friend because he is an out and proud
carnivore.
I first realised I was a faux-vegetari-
an when we were joined by the Vegan
branch of the family for Christmas last
year. The imagination that went into
our planning of the day’s meal was in-
fectious. We had delicious Black Bean
and Nut Roast, Cranberry and Cashew
Croquettes and a vast selection of col-

Vegan Christmas?
ourful vegetables.
Sounds delectable but the lifestyle
change that you incur when you be-
come a vegan is large enough that you
have to go to that part of the supermar-
ket where only hemp-clad people go...
I could never do it. Also, the hassle of
buying soya based milk, cheese and
ice-cream is just too much. Vegetari-
anism is the way to go.
Harking back to last week’s food
column, Afonso needn’t worry. Cafe
Forum/House of Coffees is safe. Well,
the Gloucester Road branch anyway.
Those of you who frequent the above-
ground route to South Kensington tube
will have possibly noted a new cafe at
the bottom of Exhibition Road? It’s of-
ficial – there is a new Cafe Forum!! The
owners have indeed branched out and
opened ANOTHER.
Before you doubt me, I have tried it
out and it serves the same pizzas, din-
ners, coffee cups, croissants... This is
the Gloucester Road version’s younger,
cleaner, South Kensington dwelling
cousin. The decor is more farmhouse-
kitchen than kitsch and the place was
empty compared to the original. The
atmosphere will come with time, so
now you know about it go and fill the
place! All it needs is its student popu-
lation and habitual old men playing
chess at midnight.
My degree of choice (Chemistry)
combines quite well with my love of
cooking. As my food simmers and
cooks, I love to think of all those mol-
ecules diffusing, breaking down and
changing state in order to make me
a tasty dinner. The Royal Society of
Chemistry have also caught on to the
exciting topic of Food Chemistry, so I
leave you with a short riddle from the
RSC to share with family and friends
this Christmas.

The Boys are Back in Town.
Bar and Grill’ in Covent Garden re-
cently opened the equally eponymous
‘Gilmour’s’. Located on Park Walk in
Chelsea, just by the HSBC bank on
the corner of Fulham Road, Gilmour’s
is billed being the English counterpart
to Christopher’s, that is, contemporary
yet understated food based on fine in-
gredients. Resplendent in its ever ex-
panding honours list, felix was lucky
enough to be invited to make a wel-
come foray into the world of Chelsea
dining. After wondering whether the
clientele would realise our suits cost
less than they would spent on a loaf of
bread, we were greeted by the restaura-
teur himself. We were sat in the heart
of the restaurant, and were able to ob-
serve the magic happening, with “Jeff
the Chef” formerly of the Rex Whistler
restaurant at the Tate Britain keeping
an impressively un-Ramsayesque cool
head when faced with a busy Friday
night.
On first glance, it may seem that the
menu is perhaps a little safe, uninspired
even. However, after having eaten the
food itself it becomes apparent that
this is Gilmour’s greatest strength. The
purpose of the food is not to be overtly
delicate and ornate, but to give pleas-
ure to the customers - the portions are
refreshingly large, and ridiculous gar-
nishes are not to be found anywhere.
This is a whistle stop tour of the high-
lights of British cuisine, albeit taste-
fully modernised and with a few gems
from abroad thrown in to give balance
and variety.
Almost inevitably, given Gilmour’s
other culinary ventures, there is a
strong influence from across the pond.
Beefburgers, cranberries, the Caesar
salad (technically a Mexican invention,
fact fans) sit alongside shepherd’s pie,
Oxfordshire blue cheese and cod and
cockle fishcakes. Similarities continue
with the obvious emphasis and atten-

tion to detail placed on steak. Two
different sized rib-eyes are available
at Gilmour’s, both twenty eight day
matured Aberdeen shorthorn cattle,
naturally. In my infinite generosity, I
allowed my not-so-glamorous date for
the evening, wannabe ‘gastronaught’
Mr. Gault, select the steak freeing me
to instead choose the Suffolk belly
pork. Impressively this came with a
generous portion of the most perfectly
cooked crackling I have ever tasted.
Although, to my heathen palate a lit-
tle more of the slow gin gravy would
have been desirable, the feather light,
creamy mashed potato more than
made up for it. Seafood lovers are also
excellently catered for, with sea bass
fillet and lemon sole with chips being
two of the main courses on offer.
The dessert menu exemplifies all
that is good about the Gilmour’s ethos.
That most classic yet maligned of Brit-
ish deserts, the knickerbocker glory,
provides the taste buds with a welcome
nostalgia trip to the English seaside.
The walnut and cranberry tartlet I
chose managed was certainly my per-
sonal highlight of the meal. And don’t
get me started on its accompaniment,
Calvados cream. Calvados is a French
apple brandy that, as a drink, I can take
or leave. But in cream it is transformed
into the food of the gods. The memory
of it makes me salivate.
So there you have it: nice boutique
restaurant in Chelsea officially better
than the boxed noodle gloop in the
SAF. Whilst Gilmour’s is undoubtedly
towards the top end of the average stu-
dent, you are certainly getting value for
money. Expect to pay £30-35 a head for
three courses, coffee, and a cheapish
bottle of wine. It is definitely more of
a place to take a loved one rather than
a big gaggle of friends, and the warm
cosy atmosphere is romantic but in a
natural, unforced way.
For lovers of food and drink one of the
most amazing things about studying at
Imperial must be the sheer variety of
markets, cafés, delis and restaurants
throughout London. From Bengali to
French, Moroccan, Thai, Turkish or
even the “modern fusion” to be found
in the SAF, the capital offers gastro-
nomic choices in abundance; indeed
you could argue that the hardest part
of eating out is deciding where exactly
to dine.
Undoubtedly the best way to find
quality places to satisfy your ravenous
student appetite and avoid some of
the utter shite out there is to get a rec-
ommendation from someone, at least
then the place is tried and tested. But
where should you start if you are new
to food scene, strapped for cash and
your friends are generally prefer lager
to langoustine?
Firstly do your research. Decide if
you are going out with friends or with
someone special, have an idea of your
budget, scour the internet, read the
reviews and check out the restaurant
website. Secondly in my experience
you can’t go wrong with a well re-
spected name. There are a good many
restaurateurs that own upmarket res-
taurants, that also run smaller, less ex-
pensive places that are well on the way
to serving exceptional food and are still
within a student budget for that special
occasion.
Christopher Gilmour, owner of the
eponymous ‘Christopher’s American
So named because it originates from a woman in
Switzerland who passed this recipe onto my moth-
er. Her name and relation to my mother have since
been forgotten. Such information is deemed use-
less and irrelevant when pouring love and effort
into this cake and subsequently wolfing it down.
At school I used to bring this cake in every year on
my birthday and it was reduced to a small pile of
crumbs well before the bell to signal the end to our
morning break.
At first I resolved never to pass on this recipe but
I thought I would for the sake of others who will
hopefully fall into a deep cocoa/sugar intoxication
after eating a substantial portion!
When it comes to baking the quantities are a rough
guide: I like to add just a splash more of the “rich-
er” ingredients (cocoa powder, chocolate sauce,
cream) just to really make it more indulgent and it
usually works wonders for the end product.
Ground almonds makes this a pricier cake to bake
but as far as I’m concerned good food is worth
spending money on as it is, after all, necessary to
live. This is best cooked in an electric oven. A fan
oven will make it ever so slightly drier.
Pre-heat the oven to 180°C.
Mix together in a bowl the dry ingredients:
2 cups of self raising flour
1 cup of cane sugar
1 cup of ground almonds
1 cup of chocolate powder (I use Green and Blacks
Hot Chocolate Drink)
Pinch of salt
Swiss Chocolate Cake
2 tsp baking powder
Mix together in a separate bowl the wet ingredients:
1 cup of cream
1 cup of milk
2 eggs
125g chocolate sauce (M&S Fair Trade Dark choco-
late truffle sauce: heat the pot up in the microwave
until its liquid and add just over half. Keep the rest
to smother on top after the cake has cooled)
Combine the wet and dry ingredients, folding them
into each other.
Put into any cake tin you like. It is best to line with
greased greaseproof paper.
Bake in the oven for approx. 50-60 mins although all
ovens vary. If you are using cupcake moulds, reduce
the cooking time by approximately half. The liquid-
ity of the batter will also affect baking time so keep
checking the cake with a ‘skewer’ (a knitting needle
or chopstick is perfect) after 45 mins, every 5-10 mins
or so. Once the skewer comes out clean the cake is
done. If you notice the cake is getting a little burnt on
top half way through baking then lie tin foil over the
top. Remember, never open the oven before half the
baking time has elapsed or the cake will sink.
Icing options: I usually pour over some of the re-
maining chocolate sauce and it let harden.
A slice served drizzled (or doused!) with double
cream is also delicious. NEVER taint this recipe with
pre-prepared icings or canned whipped cream.
