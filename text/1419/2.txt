Still serving the Union
Hamish Common Alistair Cott
Phil Power Will Dugdale
Hamish used to be President of
our Union (2000-2001) and even
graced the pages of felix (ahem
newspaper of the year ahem).
A computing graduate he now
chairs the Union Court providing
invaluable advice to the Union.
He either draws on his knowledge
of C++ or his retraining as a crim-
inal barrister. felix can’t decide.
Phil the Power as he is known af-
fectionately by many admirers
in the SAC, was RCC Chair three
years in a row from 2002-2005.
He is the Membership Services
Manager for the Union, and apart
from looking after the mighty Un-
ion minibuses, he also helps clubs
with everything that they could
need. Without The Power, the Un-
ions’ clubs would crumble.
Will Dugdale was editor of felix
from 2001-2003 and brought back
the felix cat logo. That’s right, the
logo hasn’t existed for all eterni-
ty. Back then issues like network
failure were less pressing than
ensuring the printer in the felix
office was well oiled. He’s now
the Business Systems Consultant
for the Union and amongst other
things launched ‘Imperial 101’.
Ali Cott was a Deputy President
Clubs and Societies last year and
is now employed by the Union as
a consultant. Unfortunately he, as
yet, hasn’t been paid the order of
several thousands in wages and
as a result has been forced to live
in the Union building.
Hold in there Ali, the Union is
sure to find money in the budget
for your wages, sometime.
The Engineering and Physical Sciences
Council announced late last week that
it would inject £18 million to create
five Centres for Doctoral Training at
Imperial College. These are aimed at
nurturing outstanding doctoral can-
didates as they work and do research
with colleagues from a large number of
fields, cultivating and fostering a spirit
of intellectual and academic pursuit.
This is different to most PhD student-
ships that are usually focused on re-
search that is not inter-disciplinary.
This grant is part of the EPSRC’s
£250 million announced by Lord Dray-
son, the Minister of State for Science
and Innovation. This will fund not only
the Imperial Centres but, another 39 at
other institutions.
The Rector is pleased with the award
and sees it as a way to further Impe-
rial’s mission to provide “excellent and
exciting research training”. Three of
these centres are to be run exclusively
by Imperial College, while another two
will be run jointly with the University of
Manchester and Cranfield University,
The three Imperial Centres will be
led by the Department of Physics and
will focus on plastic electronic materi-
als, materials theory and simulation as
well as controlled quantum dynamics.
The Plastic Electronics research will
focus on developing the supercon-
ductors on which the entire electron-
ics industry is based. Professor Jenny
Nelson of the Physics Department
welcomes the development as the in-
dustry “badly needs a new injection of
scientists”. The Centre for theory and
simulation of materials will aim help
scientists and researchers develop the
skills and tools to understand how ma-
terials ranging from individual atoms
to large-scale structures behave under
certain extreme conditions. The UK
currently produces no PhD graduates
in this field and Professor Adrian Sut-
ton hopes this grant will remedy the

£18million injection for new
PhD centres at Imperial
situation. This will be carried out at
the Thomas Young Centre based in the
Bessemer building.
The new CDT in controlled quan-
tum dynamics will have at its main aim
carrying out the research necessary to
develop methods of controlling and
manipulating atom-sized objects with
an extremely high degree of accuracy.
The implications of this will be seen
very prominently in the fields of in-
formation processing and global com-
munications. Professor Martin Pleno
sees this as “revolutionary” and a way
to truly bring the field “into the 21st
Century”.
These new centres help bring the
total at the College to six. The other
CDT at Imperial is focused on Chemi-
cal Biology. Lord Drayson sees this in-
vestment as an opportunity to keep UK
universities globally competitive.
