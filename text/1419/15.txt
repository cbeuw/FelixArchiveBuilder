Who decides what I wear?
Caz Knight reasons why the latest trend is actually the latest trend on the high street
A
fashion is merely a form
of ugliness so unbearable
that we are compelled to
alter it every six months.
And wasn’t Oscar Wilde
right. But fashion is meant to be a
beautiful thing. Something that allures
us, entrances us and helps us achieve
anything from elevated self-esteem to
making a statement, from making us
more attractive to the opposite sex to
competing with the same sex. If fash-
ion were not something attractive and
tasteful then why would we buy it in
the first place and why would there be
a need for such sharp changes at the
turn of every season? Of course, the
why is a combination of keeping things
fresh and to avoid the feeling that our
clothes are stagnating on our backs.
The other, more obvious reason, is a
money making one used by the fashion
houses and designers - for it is essen-
tially these people who hold the fate of
our apparel in their hands.
The return of plaid shirts to this win-
ter’s fashion landscape is an example of
a recent trend. But who decided it was
to be a must-have?
Some designer at
one or another brand
would have come up
with the idea, made it
a feature of the shop’s
inventory and a few ar-
ticles and features in the
magazines later, we are
all grappling for them.
This would apply to plaid
as well as any en vogue
colour, style of trouser
or shirt, shoe, ensemble
etc. Why did designers
choose to bring back long
tops that drown anyone short-
er than 5’7”, making them look
pregnant at the same time? This ques-
tion is pretty unanswerable and would
involve traveling to the core of a par-
ticular designer’s psyche to find these
answers (perhaps he saw some despi-
cable celebrity wearing one at Mahiki.)
The point I am trying to make is that a
season’s trends are essentially dictated
Double-Sided Tights
The effin’ definition of SICK. I
wish even I could wear them
without looking like a ladyboy-
tramp. Chanel showcased
these in their Fall/Winter 2008
collection, and I’m surprised
they’re not the big thing right
now. Before H&M or Topshop
get their mass-producing
paws all over these, snap up a
pair. Two-tone tights are styl-
ish as fuck; YSL 60s style. Add
that little special something to
your newest outfit. Do it. Now.
Simon Amstell
The Never Mind the Buzzcocks
host has been peddling the
whole indie-adult look since
he took over the show. He’s
a little hit-and-miss. He can
look proper sharp in some of
his outfits, but 100% horren-
dous in others. I wonder if he
dresses himself or a dresser
does? Either way, his comedic
timing and nous makes up for
a rather questionable stye.
More sick then shit, if you like.
Ugg Boots
If you didn’t think Ugg Boots
looked atrocious on girls, can
you now agree with every-
one else that they look plain
fucking hideous on men. I
don’t care if Ben Affleck, Leo
Di Caprio or Ronnie Wood has
been seen in them. No shape
and no style. Boys, do not
invest. From what I predict/
hope, this Ugg-wearing phase
is transient. Eskimos on the
other hand, you lot are fine.
SICK
SHIT
by the clothing shops, the people who
design clothes for them and the subse-
quent “fashionistas” who expound on
these trends as law in the magazines.
So, we have our shops full of attire for
our choosing and buying. Why do we
just happen to like what is in the shops?
A lot of us don’t, such as I. I would love
to pull off a plaid shirt as I have seen
people look gorgeous in them, but it
just won’t happen. I deplore the style of
coats around at the moment - a lot of
which are a relatively good fit around
the chest and shoulders and then ex-
pand out like a triangle, again, making
the wearer look pregnant unless they
have a BMI below 10. I am in a position
to comment on this season’s coats hav-
ing wasted a great deal of time on the
high street only to find a long, green
coat, ten years my senior, in a vintage
shop at a fraction of the price. And I
look amazing in it.
A fashion then becomes fashionable
because a substantial number of peo-
ple adhere to it following indoctrina-
tion by the brands. Perhaps the small-
minded nature of man is brought out in
us when it comes to fash-
ion as we go along and
copy how those around
us are dressing. Maybe it
is an inherent instinct to
fit in and be accepted. I
hope this is not the case,
although, one would be
forgiven for doing so as
it is easy to underesti-
mate the colossal pres-
sure exerted on us
by society these
days, thanks to
an endless ac-
cess to media.
Obviously, not
everyone follows fashion.
And there is not just one
fashion, there are many tributaries of
fashion along which to ride on and we
are at liberty to switch on a daily ba-
sis. The clothes I wear are entirely in-
dicative of my mood, how I feel about
myself, and what sort of look I want to
work, not having found a niche I am
completely comfortable with. I would
fall more into the fashionista category.
A rise in vintage shops means we are
much more at liberty to choose our
own fashion as we have access to those
from yesteryear, as my recent shopping
trip demonstrated.
What may be trendy and flattering
on one person could be a disaster for
another. Most cuts of top, trouser and
dress at the present moment are all det-
rimental for my figure. At only 5’4” it is
sensible for me to wear short skirts and
dresses to make me look less tiny. I am
also more comfortable baring my legs
(not necessarily out of vanity). How-
ever, all the short dresses and skirts are
designed for taller people and so fall to
my knees rather than mid thigh. Most
‘normal’ length tops fall well past my
hips which is something else I hate.
One redeeming quality of Topshop is
their ‘petite’ section which is a dream
come true for me as I am able to find
those short, tight tops I love.
So, why do a lot of us just happen to
like what is in fashion and what makes
us look back on it with hindsight in
disgust? The 90s were abhorrent (not
just in a fashion sense), so why did we
ever sport greasy curtains (the men at
any rate), denim jackets, baggy t-shirts
with leggings (of which I am guilty of,
but my eight-year-old folly should be
excused) and tie-dye? In ten years I am
pretty sure the thought of Ugg boots
will be recoiled at; I already do. Don’t
even get me started on Crocs. Fashion
is a fickle thing but not as fickle as our
tastes. Getting to the roots of what ex-
actly it is that makes us like something
is still an issue under much study by
anthropologists and neuroscientists
alike.
If we look at what the first cave men
started to wear (fur mainly: I am a
massive fan, to hell with the ethics of
it) up until what “civilised” man wears,
we can look at it as a sort of evolu-
tion. What influences this evolution?
Certainly not survival of the fittest or
fur coats would be in. Environment,
the weather (sort of), culture, popular
culture influenced by everything from
politics, albeit perhaps very tenuously,
music, art and, I am loathe to say it, fa-
mous people all play a part.
As much as I have disparaged fash-
ion’s fickleness in this piece, there is
no denying the pleasure of appreciat-
ing the wider body of fashion – that is
all the clothes, shoes and accessories
available to us in the world - just as
we might appreciate the craft and skill
that has gone into creating a truly glo-
rious sculpture or painting.
I
f you think you haven’t heard of
designer Elie Saab, think again.
In fact, think back to when
Halle Berry won her Oscar for
Monster’s Ball, you know, when
she cried like a pansy. She was wear-
ing Elie Saab and was one of the first
celebrity endorsements the Lebanese
designer had had at that point.
The dress had a completely sheer up-
per half with floral embroidery cover-
ing her breasts and a crimson taffeta
skirt. Although not one of his best de-
signs, it was undeniably controversial
and raised his profile in Hollywood
and internationally.
His dresses are some of the most
flamboyant and ornate designs avail-
able, though he has been slammed
for creating pieces that are over the
top; pieces that “wear” the wearer of
the garment. This may be down to an
inherent snobbery in the fashion in-
dustry as he is self-taught and spent
only one year in Paris studying fashion
before returning in 1982 to open his
workshop in Lebanon.
To me, his work is synonymous with
luxury and fantasy and it is definitely
the style of the season. Many of his
dresses are jewel-encrusted and would
not look out of place on a fairy atop a
Christmas tree, and I mean that as a
compliment.
One of my favourite dresses from
his Autumn/Winter 08 collection is a
purple taffeta-accentuated prom style
dress. Its volume and colour give im-
pact of theatrical standard!
This compares to the 07/08 collec-
tion that saw a more whimsical ‘winter
wonderland’ and ‘snow queen’ inspira-
tion come into play. I cannot wait for
spring!
