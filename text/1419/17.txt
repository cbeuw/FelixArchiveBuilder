Stuff IC Students Like!? :)
I
would like to start off by saying
how much fun it has been to
do Coffee Break this term. The
number of inside jokes to come
out of this section is uncount-
able. It truly is a pleasure. However
what else is there for me to do? Well
after many brain storming sessions
in the UNION we have come up with
something special.
It is know as the ESL, and is a collec-
tion of fictional super heroes written by
a covert super genius known as UNPC.
Now some of you may not agree with
his comedic stylings and controversial
stereotypes, however it is still funny
and I think a valuable source of low
brow laughs. So look forward to it.
Unfortunately we have been told that
our plans to include a Where’s Wally?
puzzle every week can no longer pro-
ceed. Something to do with copyright
infringement. However we have start-
ed our plans to bring in a totally unique
alternative!?! Where’s Al? A complete-
ly new and innovation idea where we
dress Al Norman up in a stripy red
and white jumper and hat, place him
11. Bar nights:
What happens if you mix cheap entry,
multiple kegs of beer, a few boat races
and the occasional yard?... We get car-
nage of the 1st
order. Here at Imperial
we are blessed with many of these holy
nights- none better than the fabled
ACC Bar night- seriously £5 for your
share of 25 kegs, is this heaven on
Earth?
I was recently frequenting such an
event hosted by MatHSoc (Maths and
Materials), believe me, the beer doth
floweth in epic proportions. Freshers,
you must go to these events, yes all of
them. Sod lectures.

Virgo
You think you’re
on a winner here,
especially with the
cold winter months
where many die
from the severe cold.
How can you lose? Santa agrees and with that
money he buys a shelter for you to run for the
homeless. However after realising the current
economic state, you keep the house and kick all
the lazy bums back onto the streets.
Scorpio
You suddenly realise
how little you care
about Christmas
and Santa. If you
want your own
present, you go
and get it with your own money. So with Santa
left awestruck at your lack of belief you decide
to show him a thing or two. But what do you
do? Do you use Rudolph in which case go to
Sagittarius, or do you use the elf and go to Libra.
Libra
Well, you choose
the elf, good for
you, unlucky for the
elf. That poor little
fella is going to get a
banging of a lifetime.
Working nine to five and the occasional
weekend, you pound out that small metal ring.
Luckily for you your job is an Ironmonger, you
haven’t been violating an elf. The small bobble
on the hat is perfect for a small hammer.
Capricorn
Santa, so scared
by your supreme
power bows down
to all your demands.
Christmas is banned,
all presents given to
a girl called Megan and all beer to a chap called
D.I. Rytrapist. Santa becomes a hobo, living in
the gutter and off scraps people throw at him in
disgust. After years you and Santa meet up at
the Soup Kitchen and you say... Pint?
Sagittarius
You put Santa at
the top of the ski
jump and give him
a porno mag and
remove his pants.
On his way down
he happens to get a boner and unfortunately
Rudolph was looking at the stars from the
bottom of the run and Santa just happened
to end up penetrating him. You watch with
delight as Santa tries to withdraw, but he can’t.
Cancer
Yep, you’ve guessed
it, even though you
have raised £10,000
Santa gives you a
nasty present for
your wicked ways.
No, not a lump of coal, he gives you Cancer!
Enjoy! You should have been more considerate
when you were taking the money from the
poor and homeless on the streets of South
Kensington.
Gemini
Clearly touched by
your generosity,
Santa gives you £1
million, but you
have to collect it in
the middle of the
desert. When you get there, you realise that
you were given it all in chocolate coins, which
has melted. In a fit of rage, you go around and
kill all the poor people you gave the money to
and take the money back. You go to hell.
Leo
You blew it and you
forget that Santa
knows your name
Mike Squire! Instead
of giving you the
gift, he gives it to
your mum. Even she thought you were a twat,
or at least that’s what he thinks, he was behind
her and there was something in her mouth so
everything was a little muffled. Santa definitely
filled her stockings this Christmas.
Taurus
Although appalled
hesee’shopeyetwith
your honesty. You
receive the chance to
redeem yourself, but
with all of Santa’s
rambling, you get bored and start taking some
of the toys for yourself. He catches you. Do you
1) lie and say you were going to put them in the
sled or 2) do you tell the truth? If the first go to
Leo, if the second go to Scorpio.
Aries
Santa, still not
convinced with you
kindness, makes you
decide between the
two. He wants to
know what means
more to you, the poor or the homeless. If you
rate raising money for the poor more that
raising it for the homeless, go to Gemini. If
you think that the alternative is better, go to
Virgo.
Pisces
Santa looks at the
list of things that
you’ve done that
were apparently so
great. Two things
pop to your mind:
1)You helped raise money for the poor and
homeless. 2) With your Imperial Investment
group you raised £10,000 for club spending. If
you think the first is better, go to Aries, if the
second, go to Cancer.
And Santa gave felix some ho-ho-ho-roscopes
Aquarius
Santa was working
late last night
making his list
before checking it
twice. He needed
to find out who
was naughty and who was nice, so as to know
what presents to get for the boys and girls at
Imperial. So this is where you help him. If you
think you were naughty this year, go to Taurus.
If you think you were nice go to Pisces.
Santa doesn’t exist. I hope I have spoiled it for you. If you have any complaints, you may sod off

Coffee Break Editor
in crowded places, take a picture and
le you guys find him every week. You
have never seen anything like it be-
fore, I am sure. Take that copyright
infringement!
What is upsetting to some is the ever
evading Sikh MC. I’m sure he will make
a cameo appearance eventually, but for
now I wouldn’t hold your breath. We
will have to see what comes of the spe-
cial characters in Coffee Break through
out next term.
The fierce competition in the FUC-
WIT league is only getting more heat-
ed as we reach the end of the term. We
have iPods for the winners so try and
grab as many points as possible. With
the addition of the Mentalist Maze this
week you may think it counts toward
the FUCWIT league, but you’d be
wrong. It’s just a bit of fun instead of
the quickie crossword. Also congratu-
lations to Team Shotgun who have ac-
cumulated 100 Points. However now
is not the time to get complacent with
team MSMM a close second with 99
points. Who will be the winner? Who
will get those iPods?

Coffee
Photoshop Competition -11
This week’s winner. Team felix (..who still can’t spell- Ed.) Next week’s RAW image for you to go wild. See www.felixonline.co.uk
Congratulations to this week’s win-
ner, Team felix. That’s right, we did
this one ourselves. It may involve no
photoshop skills at all, but it was done
on photoshop so it counts. Also it is
well funny. We had the caption origi-
nally as “disappointment at marriage
counselling” but family planning is
way better. Mainly because it’s 2 guys,
they can’t have children biologically.
Who the hell would give birth?
This is the last photoshop competition
this year, and we hope you’ll be able to
tune up on your skills over Christmas
in anticipation for next years round of
photoshop competitions. Thanks for
the entries this year guys.
The high res picture can be found on-
line. Click on Coffee Break in the sec-
tions tab. Email your entry to coffee.
felix@imperial.ac.uk with your team
name and .PSD file and you’ll be en-
tered into the FUCWIT league.
What do points win? Prizes. Oh yeah!
i.e. iPods.
This week’s image is of of a dark tree
in a valley. Do what you will with this
one. You could turn it into a Christmas
tree, you could hang dead bodies off it
Fallout 3 style. It is up to you. You have
4 weeks to do this one, so make it good.
I expect some super entries for the first
weeks issue next term. Have fun and
Merry Christmas!
(Please drink responsibly)
Right. Same as normal, just com-
plete the puzzles and send them to su-
doku.felix@imperial.ac.uk the first
correct answer gets 5 points, then 4, 3,
2 and 1. Puzzles on offer this week are:
Mega Crossword, Photoshop Com-
petition, Wordoku and Slitherlink. As
noticed we have no Cryptic or Quick-
ie so the Mega Crossword is worth
QUADRUPLE points! It has however
taken the meaning of über hard to a
whole new level. Get the most points
at the end of the year and win an iPod
Nano!
Remember: Wordoku must not just
be the word, and that team Shotgun
and MÖchten sie mein Manschaft?
are getting away quite quickly. If anyone
beats them in the Mega Crossword this
week they will both be frozen out of the
points for it. Sorry fellas- I have to pro-
mote competition.
A
h this is the end of
Snakey B. It’s been a
good run, and as the
author of this fine char-
acter of many disguises I
feel slightly sad. Sure it was great fun to
photoshop some of the pictures (my fa-
vourite is the one of Mohammed Ali),
and sure it was enjoyable to rant about
these celebrities’ flaws, imperfections
or in contrast their qualities that make
them loved and adored by all. All I can
say is thank you for the great response
we down in the office have got towards
Snakey B, and we certainly hope the
new gimmick that will replace me will
be up to your high standards. All stu-
dents love snake bite, so by association
they love me. I love you too guys, I’m
totally not crying right now.
