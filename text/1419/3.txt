Students feel the pinch
What is being done about it?
I
n the survey carried out by felix,
two very simple questions were
asked to determine the level of
which students have felt affect-
ed. The first question was sim-
ply asking the students if they have felt
affected where it was found that there
was a fairly even split between those
who did (48%) and those who didn’t
(52%).
When looking at the results closer
and examining each age group, a more
interesting correlation was found. Just
over 2/3 of the students who said that
they didn’t feel affected were in their
first and second year. Some might hy-
pothesize that this is due the fact that
the students have only just started liv-
ing independently and have not been
exposed to ‘the real world’ of bills and
rent.
In an expected contrast, of the stu-
dents that did say they felt affected by
the current economic climate, again
just over 2/3 were in either their third
or fourth year. These students have
been living independently for several
years now and have seen the change in
food prices, bills as well as rent, with
the increased rent being linked the in-
crease in house prices and the inability
for first time buyers to purchase their
own house. One fourth year maths
student said that the highest cost they
have seen rise over the past few years
have been with bill. “I’ve noticed that
my weekly shop has steadily been get-
ting more expensive and the bills in-
crease from year to year”, he told felix.
Ed Miliband, the new Energy Secre-
tary for Labour, told an audience at the
Imperial College Energy Future Lab on
Tuesday that “We have recently seen
big falls in wholesale gas and electric-
ity prices, but I understand that be-
cause energy companies tend to buy

The credit crunch
on a global scale
U
nknown to many, the
financial meltdown
has been a long time
coming. Although the
widespread panic and
dramatic decrease in confidence
is a relatively new ordeal, the crux
of the issue can be said to have be-
gan in 2001 with the bursting of the
technology/dot com bubble and
obviously, the traumatic events of
September 11th. While the succes-
sion of events was not necessarily
deemed to have such far-reaching
effects, it happened hastily, covertly
and mostly, outside the scrutiny of
public eye.
After these events, the US decid-
ed to cut interest rates to levels not
seen in a very long time, resulting
in a higher than average demand for
houses all across the country, obvi-
ously leading to an increase in the
overall prices for houses. In hind-
sight, it would not be unfair to say
that this particular moment defined
the markets for the years that would
come. Given the booming housing
market, a lot of starry-eyed mortgage
companies saw a supposed opportu-
nity to get their pie share’s worth and
started a highly irresponsible lending
frenzy. This included not perform-
ing the most basic of credit checks,
lending to people with bad credit
and on incomes that were too low to
cover the repayments should inter-
ests increase on variable-rate mort-
gages. This is what is now known as
the subprime market.
When inflation began to reach
levels that worried the government,
rates were hiked to 4% meaning that
people who took out gargantuan
loans suddenly found themselves
unable to make monthly repayment
and defaults shot through the roof,
leaving many mortgage providers
severely wounded due to their own
irresponsibility and lack of regula-
tion. The result was a sharp decline

immediately.”
“But they must be passed on as soon
as possible.”
In his speech, Mr Miliband was criti-
cising the fact that energy companies
will not be lowering their prices as
they will be frozen, with one spokes-
man for Centrica, which has 16 million
customers in the UK, saying that they
“cannot now sell this gas at a loss... we
will have to wait.”
In a recent survey carried out by
Zebra Technologies, it suggested that
roughly 54% of students felt that the
current student discounts were not
catering their current needs (felix is-
sue 1,410). A similar question was
put forward to the students that took
part in the felix survey, where an over-
whelming 93% of students said that
they would prefer to see discounts on
living essentials, such as groceries,
than on luxury items such as clothes
and music.
The British government, in an at-
tempt to ease the economy, decided to
reduce the standard rate of VAT from
17.5% to 15% as of 1st December 2008
until 1st January 2010. VAT, or value
added tax, is the tax added onto any
item that is bought, with several differ-
ent levels of VAT, including zero rate
VAT that is charged on food, books and
newspapers. Only luxury food items
such as chocolate and drinks, such as
alcohol and fizzy drinks are taxed at
the standard rate.
The Catering Department at Imperi-
al College, and Imperial College Union
[ICU] have both released statements
explaining the effect these changes will
have on the goods that they sell. In a
statement in last week’s issue of felix,
ICU said that “The Union Shop and
Newsagent have reduced their prices
and although some of the marked up
prices have not changed yet, the price
in house prices at a time when con-
struction was at an all time high,
creating a massive disparity in sup-
ply and demand. This meant that
lenders had a tough time getting the
amounts of the loan back by selling
the repossessed house, hurting their
financials further.
In order to lend money, mortgage
providers repackaged their debt in
complex financial products which
they sold to supposedly responsible
banks, ensuring the ratings agency
gave these vehicles very high ratings,
falsely deeming them suitable and
a worthwhile investment. Because
this debt was not to be paid back
by the borrowers, the institutions
that bought this collaterised debt
were then faced with a problem of
bad debt that needed to be written
off their balance sheet substantially
reducing their capital and hence
the amount available for day-to-day
lending to other banks (the money
market), creating what we now know
as the credit crunch.
Because of the money being hem-
orrhaged by banks, selling and short-
selling of their shares started hap-
pening en-masse ferociously driving
their prices down. This led to one of
the biggest problems in an economy:
decrease of consumer confidence.
Given the irresponsible lending of
the past combined with less avail-
able capital, institutions are now un-
able to lend as much, resulting in a
decrease in demand for houses fur-
ther driving the downward spiral of
prices.
It would be foolish to say that only
big financial corporations are af-
fected by these unfortunate events.
Investment on the part of companies
has taken a downturn and consumer
spending has dramatically slowed
down putting a lot of strain on the
economy that is likely to lead to fur-
ther unemployment and even more
losses in the financial markets.
Students are not immune to this
crisis that is pointing more clearly
each day to a global recession.
you will actually pay at the till has been
reduced accordingly.”
“The Union Catering’s prices will not
change as VAT is not applicable to our
food sales.”
“The Union Bars’ prices will remain
unchanged due to the rise in the duty
on alcohol cancelling out any change
in prices that may be passed on to the
Union by our suppliers.”
In a similar statement sent to felix,
the Catering Department said, “As
you are aware selling prices have not
changed since 1 December and a com-
plete analysis of the first week’s sales
has been undertaken.” For some time
now there has been a different pric-
ing structure in College, with students
not paying VAT on some items and an
agreement with HR Customs and Ex-
cise meant that they could only reclaim
some rather than all of the VAT. The
Catering Department went on to say
that “For this reason on a transaction
basis the implications of the VAT de-
crease are negligible (for example, 0.3p
for a Mars Bar) and it is therefore inap-
propriate to adjust prices.”
They had calculated that, over the
past week, figures show that the Col-
lege profited by maintaining the pub-
lished prices to the tune of £796 from
staff transactions and £151 from stu-
dent transactions. Since the College
Catering Department is “run for the
benefit of the students and staff of the
College on a not for profit basis” and
as such they have decided to reduce
the cost of dinners in the Senior Com-
mon Room [SCR] by 25p and have also
decided to donate £2,000 to the 2009
Summer Ball.
There are also plans from ICU to im-
prove the services offered in the bars,
with the main plan being to revue the
drinks that are on offer. These changes
are likely to occur in the New Year.
The effect the crunch has
had at Imperial
A
new Imperial brand
has started to appear
over the whole cam-
pus, Taste Imperial.
This new unified ca-
tering service on campus is there
for the students and staff at Imperial
and has taken control of all outlets,
including vending machines. Many
found this change a surprise to say
the least as in some cases, all that
was left on certain vending machines
was a simple notice, as can be seen in
the image on the right.
With the new unification on cam-
pus, which includes the removal of
nine vending machines, the main
fear from students was that there
would be an increase in costs. This
was the case and now there is a set
price across campus. The College
also reimbursed the departments
that may have incurred any financial
loss over the new unification.
The main problem that remained
was the increase in prices, with some
items, such as coffee, doubling in
price in certain departments. How-
ever it is not only the College that
has been changing its prices. At the
start of this year, as well as bringing
in a whole new range of drinks, Im-
perial College Union [ICU] decided
to increase their prices by 10% per
pint. On the other hand, they have
recently managed to create a Christ-
mas menu for less than £5 a head
for three courses. This increase in the
price of goods, as is the case in all retail
outlets, is partly due to the state of the
economy.
As expected, the results of the sur-
vey showed that the first year students
hadn’t even realised that there was a
change in price, but when told about
what they thought about the prices of
items, they said that the prices “weren’t
too bad” and that “chocolates and fizzy
drinks are cheaper, if not the same at
some other places.” This rather ex-
pected result could be explained by
the sheer fact that this is their first year
here so it is not possible to observe a
change in the prices.
In contrast, the second year stu-
dents that were surveyed did realise
that there was a difference in prices,
with approximately 2/3 of students
asked thinking that the increase in
prices were not good. The proportion
of students having negative feelings to-
wards the change increase in the third
and fourth years as students had been
around for longer.
Many of the older students had
some string views about the increase
in prices across the campus. One 3rd
year Biology student told felix that she
felt that “the increase in prices was not
warranted as there was not an equal
increase in quality.” Another 3rd year
student, from the Materials depart-
ment, said that there was simply “no
need!” He then followed on by saying
that “the Sandwich Shop has barely
put up its prices and they are the main
competitors.”
Paddy Jackman, Director of Com-
mercial Services at Imperial College,
when hearing of the results, told fe-
lix that “these were the first rises in
2 years, indeed some prices were re-
duced at the beginning of the 2007-08
academic year, and reflected the sharp
increases seen in the price of the vast
majority of food products in the early
part of 2008. The Commercial Services
department recognises the constraints
that the vast majority of students have
on their budgets and seeks to provide a
service to students and staff that mere-
ly covers its costs.”
“We competitively shop against
other universities and the high street
on a constant basis to ensure that we
provide a value for money service and
our surveys indicate that we compare
favourably against other academic in-
stitutions. We do try to offer additional

3rd & 4th year
students thought
the prices changes
were bad”
value through ‘meal deals’ and by
closely liaising with suppliers to ensure
that we get the benefit of any promo-
tions they are running.”
Clearly the effects of the crunch have
reached our own student shores, and
although many students are unhappy
about the change in prices, it seems,
at least for now, there is not much
that can be done to alleviate the ap-
parent burden that the students cur-
rently feel students.
Employment possibilities
T
he current state of the
economy has also meant
that many jobs are at risk,
especially in the financial
sector. In the past year
1.9 million jobs have been lost in the
US alone and the number is expected
to rise. Over the past couple of years,
the majority of Imperial graduates
have gone into the banking and finan-
cial sector, closely followed by ‘other
business activities’ as stated on the
College’s Careers website. More tradi-
tional employment opportunities for
Imperial graduates, such as engineer-
ing, science and mining, have slowly
seen a drop off in numbers.
These jobs now appear to be more
secure, with a recent survey by Mon-
ster.com suggesting that “the work-
ers most in demand, even in a down
economy are those who excel in the
logical and mathematical skills.” To
mirror the expected decline in jobs
in the financial sector, RBS told The
Edinburgh Journal that “as a result of
the current climate, we will be taking
on fewer graduates in 2009.” In con-
trast to the statement made by RBS,
a HSBC spokesman said that: “In the
retail and commercial banking, our
strategy in recruiting graduates is to
take into account our expected middle
management and senior management
vacancies six to eight years after the
graduate completes their development
programme.”
felix has been made aware that there
are several recent Imperial graduates
who have been affected directly by the
credit crunch, with many being made
redundant after just 5 months of work.
To make matters worse for graduates,
the Student Loans Company has de-
cided to change its rate of interest from
2.4% to 4.8% and is currently set at 3%,
meaning students will have more to
pay off.
In the survey carried out by felix,
we asked the students if they were
worried about employment after they
finish their degree. Rather unsurpris-
ingly, 95% of first and second years
students said that they were not wor-
ried, with the main reason being that
they felt the economy would stabilise
by the time they finish. The results
from the third and fourth year students
showed a mixed bag of results. Of the
80 students asked between the two
year groups, 69% said they were wor-
ried about the job, with the majority
of them initially looking for jobs in the
financial sector. Of the students who
were not worried, the main reason fi-
nal year students gave (this includes
those on a three year course) was that
they had already secured a job with the
majority going to work in the science
and engineering sector. 16% of third
and fourth year students also said that
they will be carrying on their studies in
the hope to weather the storm.
The fact is that there are still jobs
available for graduates although these
might not be in the financial sector.
And those who have worked in the fi-
nance sector have found other oppor-
tunities available to them. Below are
some case studies.
