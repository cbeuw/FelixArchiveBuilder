T
he final issue of term is
upon and oh has it been
a lively term for sports at
Imperial. After a reason-
able start, we have got into
the swing of things and hope you have
seen the improvement in the sports
pages.
We have slightly tweaked the for-
mat to mirror that of the back page, to
some extent, and we have reduced the
amount of text-heavy articles, like we
said we would!
A room for improvement is the
amount of errors in the articles, be it
typos, grammar etc. As the copy edi-
tors of the paper have lives, and can’t
stay late to read our section it is down
to us to spot mistakes.
Quite hard after going to the union
the day before the issue goes to print.
Therefore we would like to call all
those interested in ‘copy editing’ the
sports pages to drop us a line at sport.
felix@imperial.ac.uk, or come and
have a chat whenever you see either
of us around so we can sort something
out. It’s not that hard of a job, the ba-
The netball 1s hadn’t won a game all
season and as they headed off to Cat-
ford to face Kings Medics they knew
if they were going to change that then
this would be the night…
Waiting in the changing rooms for a
caretaker to be found to switch on the
floodlights spirits were high. Perhaps
a little too high and cocky though as
when we eventually got on court over
half an hour late the first quarter was a
disastrous affair. No matter how many
beautiful interceptions kept being
made in defence the ball was continu-
ously lost as the girls tried to bring it
down court. This lack of flow through
the team has been a recurring prob-
lem all term due to inconsistencies in
the squad and was the main reason for
our continued defeats. We lost the first
four centres in a row. Along with some
shocking umpiring that saw attack re-
peatedly being contacted as they tried
to take a shot but it never getting called
up and defence being pulled up for dis-
tance at 6’ odd this saw the first quarter
end at 7-5 to GKT.
IC took themselves to one side for
a team talk looking a bit dismal. Keen
eyed Team Captain Rachel Dilley how-
ever had other concerns. She felt the
quarter hadn’t seemed long enough
so questioned the umpires. Having
found out we’d only played 12 minutes
instead of the required 15 due to the
late start she insisted we be allowed to
get back on and finish the remaining
3 minutes because we hadn’t been in-
formed before play began. This saw us
lose another goal so the score became
8-5 to GKT. It also caused an argu-
ment between the GKT Captain and
the umpires, which resulted in the silly
girl crying and taking herself off for the
rest of the game!?
The Imperial girls all knew what
they had to do. Concentration wasn’t
there, the aggression and want of the
win wasn’t there. We came back on for
the second quarter more determined
knowing we were the better team and
we just needed to start playing at the
level we were capable of.
Frustration with the refereeing
started to get to several players includ-
ing GK Kate Chapman, who slammed
the ball on the floor after yet another
ridiculous call causing it to hit the
base of the post and almost knock one
of the umpires in the face, and GA
Colette Gregory, whose shooting was
completely off. Nevertheless, IC still
managed to pull it back to 12 all at half
time.
Rachel asked her team if they actu-
ally wanted to win a game this season
and instructed Colette to “give it some”.
Coming back on for the third quarter
is when it all went wrong for Kings. A
miscalculated substitution of their GA
let IC pull away and our confidence

Merry
Christmas!
sic job-description is to read articles
and check for grammatical mistakes. I
shan’t mention the fact you could put
it on your CV if you are struggling on
your extra-curricular section.
Anyhow enough harping on about
the goings on of the paper and onwards
to the future.
Jack and I have devised some ideas
for the sports pages next year, which
hopefully will see fruition. This in-
cludes possible comments columns
from prominent people within the
ACC.
Expect more debates and more opin-
ion pieces from us, including a possible
resurrection of the ‘superclub’ debate.
The final week of college has slightly
reduced the number of games tak-
ing place this week but we still have a
hearty five pages for you to digest in-
cluding Jack’s interview with Catherine
Atkin.
Squash are still ruling things by the
way.
Have a merry Christmas and what-
ever you do, keep fit and don’t suffer
from the Christmas dinner pile on.
soar leading to successive goals. De-
fence kept talking to each other and
the Chapman-Dilley-Davies combina-
tion totally dominated the opposition’s
attack. Carolyn Sharpe (despite suffer-
ing from a two-day hangover after the
epic Netball Christmas Dinner!) and
Nicole Evans, at C and WA respective-
ly, started to work the ball down better
with support from behind. A change
of tactics in the goal third saw some
sneaky elbows off ball from Colette to
teach her GD a lesson and movement
out of the D by the GS Sam Westrop
to create more space for her GA meant
the balls kept going in. IC came off 21-
15 ahead.
The question was: were the girls go-
ing to let it go in the last quarter like
they had in so many other games? Not
a chance. Some say the play in attack
in the final quarter was “poetry in
motion”, but they might be twats, for
example twat of the match in Rachel
Dilley. This award was given for acci-
dentally pulling her pants down along
with her skort in the changing rooms
after the game. I think it might have
been in anticipation of the centre-
fold appearance! Player of the match
was Nicole who has boundless energy
and is fully devoted to every game. IC
player was Kate Chapman who had a
great game right from the start mak-
ing “lovely” interception after “lovely”
interception.
The final score was 35-19 to Impe-
rial resulting in a group hug and girly
whoops of delight!! We’ll be coming to
a page three near you very soon!!
