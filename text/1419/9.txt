As part of our continuing commitment
to ensure our services are relevant
and effective for our members,
we are carrying out a survey of our
Trading outlets. This short survey
consists of seven areas of Union
Trading and will only take 5 minutes to
complete. It covers our bars, catering,
entertainments, the Union Building and
also the customer service you receive.
The responses we receive will directly
affect the services we offer in the future,
so please fill out the survey with this in
mind. It is essential that we get as many
responses as possible so that we can
improve on areas of the areas of Union
Trading that need it the most. Of course
as we move forward with the future
phases of the Building Redevelopment,
including the refurbishment of our
ground floor services, we will be using
your responses to help shape these
changes. We will be selecting two
people at random to win an iPod nano as
well so fill out the survey now!
The survey can be found at
imperialcollegeunion.org/surveys.
Next term we will also be running other
surveys on other areas of the Union
giving you even more chance to let
us know how you want your Union to
change or even the areas that you are
especially pleased with!
In the mean time we are holding a
Trading Froum which is taking place on
Wednesday 17 December in Meeting
Room 7, Union Building from 13:00 -
14:00. Refreshments will be provided.

International Students’ Officer
Back in October over 3,000 of you moved
into Imperial Halls of Residences in a flurry
of induction lectures, parties and endless
tours of London. Now that the excitement
of moving in and freshers’ week has died
down a bit, I’m keen to hear your views
about your experience of living in halls.
I’ll be visiting each individual halls of
residence to talk informally to the students.
I’ll be passing your views onto residences,
hall managers and wardens as appropriate
so they know what you really love about
living in halls and what you think would
improve your time there. Issues could
include anything from the number and type
of events, cleaning, availability of welfare
advice in halls- basically, whatever you like!
I’ll be armed with nibbles and drinks so pop
along even if it is for just 10 minutes at your
relevant hall:
Fisher and Bernard Sunley (Fisher
Common Room): 5-6pm, Sunday 14
December
Holbein, Willis
Jackson and
Southwell
(Willis Jackson
Common Room):
6-7pm, Sunday 14
December
Falmouth,
Keogh, Tizard
& Selkirk
(Southside Social Space): 7-8pm, Tuesday

I will be visiting other Halls early next term,
so look out for further details in Felix.
Normal Halls Committee will resume next
term so if you have comments tell your hall
rep and information will be passed on to me
in the same way.
