The stimulus package won’t work
Luke Dhanoa
Business Editor
In an attempt to save the economy,
Gordon Brown has given us all 2.5%
off our VAT rate. In theory this should
make Christmas shopping cheaper and
make us all want to spend more and
when we spend more it’s good for the
economy. Economic theory calls this a
“stimulus package” – i.e. a set of gov-
ernment actions that are designed to
stimulate the economy. In real life we
call this a “mistake” or “fail maneuver”
because whilst the stimulus package is
a good idea in theory, it doesn’t work
so well in real life. Here’s why:
1
The 2.5% cut isn’t really
2.5%.
It’s actually more like 2.1%
when you think about it. It’s
because a 2.5% cut in VAT
isn’t a 2.5% cut in the price of the whole
thing. I know that may sound funny so
here’s how it works.
VAT or Value Added Tax is a tax on
transactions taking place, meaning that
the tax kicks in during the buying and
selling of a product. So if something
costs £100, you end up paying £117.50
(from £100 x 1.175) because the tax sits
on top of the price. Now at this point
you might be wondering about all the
stuff you bought for £100. A common
misconception is that if you have to
pay £100 for something, then £17.50
of that £100 is VAT, but that’s not true.
If you have to pay £100 for something
then the actual price is £85.10 and the
VAT is £14.90. This is because £14.90
is 17.5% of £85.10.
So what happens when VAT goes
from 17.5% to 15%? Well, under the old
law VAT at 17.5% meant that a £100
product would cost £117.50 and now it
costs £115.00. The difference, £2.50, is
really only 2.1% of the original price.
2
Shops will steal the cut.
Back in the day the NUS
(National Union of Students)
campaigned long and hard
against the government to
reduce the tax on condoms. When the
government relented and reduced the
tax rate, the NUS sat back thinking it
had won a victory for studentkind and
casual shaggers everywhere. But when
the government cut the condom tax,
nothing changed. The condom compa-
nies simply absorbed the tax cut into
their profit margins and students eve-
rywhere carried on as usual.
This time around with the new tax
cut, things will probably be the same.
Because products are usually listed
with VAT included, it would be very
easy for shopkeepers to just take the
extra 2.1% for themselves. In fact, it
would cost them extra to change all the
labels in their shops to pass the saving
on to the customer.
I know that when you went shopping
last the shopkeeper reduced the prices,
but not all shops are going to. Some-
thing that cost £1 a month ago is still
probably going to cost the same today.
There are millions of transactions for
small amounts every day, and they’re
all unaffected.

2.1% ain’t that much.
Have you ever ordered
something from China? It
takes ages to get here. And
I mean AGES. That’s why all
the shops and large retailers ordered
their products for Christmas months
ago, before they realised how bad the
recession would be.
The resulting oversupply is nothing
new, usually after Christmas you have
the January sales, where all the shops
try and sell of whatever leftover Christ-
mas stuff they can. But because of the
massive oversupply this year there’s
no way the shops could clear all the
leftover sock in January, which has led
to some of the biggest Christmas sales
we’ve seen for years. Compared to the
reductions that the stores are offering,
the 2.1% cut is pretty paltry. In fact, a
lot of people only notice the cut when
they’re at the till, suggesting that the
price cut didn’t even happen to come
into the buying decision.
4
We’re all saving for later.
We all know that the tax
cut will have to be paid for in
the future using higher taxes.
So even though we’re saving
a little at the till we’re going to be hit
somewhere else. It’s likely (because we
have a left leaning government) that
the people who’ll be affected most of
the future tax burden will be the richer
middle and upper class. But the prob-
lem is that these are exactly the kind of
people that the government wants to
promote into spending. It’s the richer
class who buy stuff they don’t need,
and it’s that over consumption that
our “shop keeper” economy thrives on.
Telling these groups that they’re go-
ing to face higher taxes will just pro-
voke them into spending less on use-
less junk – the exact opposite idea to
Christmas.
So what’s the alternative? Well, David
Cameron has been smugly trying to
paint the government plans as disas-
trous without suggesting any realis-
tic alternatives and although his logic
seems to be seductive, it’s important to
ignore what he says. While he is a very
skilled politician, his arguments in fa-
vour of slashing government spending
are pretty silly. This recession is a clas-
sic stagflation case and if history has
shown us anything, it’s that active gov-
ernment is the best way through.
On the supply side of the economy,
food, oil, steel and credit became
more expensive. This rose the costs of
companies, which rose prices, which
screwed things up. In the wake of the
news of the recession and a decreased
demand, steel and oil have dropped
dramatically in price. The government
stepped in to make credit more avail-
able and eventually it should ease the
problem. The only remaining problem
is food, which the government can’t
tackle quickly anyway.
On the demand side there is a lack of
confidence in the economy. That lack
of confidence is cutting back private
expenditure. Without that expendi-
ture, the economy has less to produce
which leads to job losses, which leads
to even less confidence. So in this
case the government is stepping in to
buy up more. By adding to consump-
tion (in classic Keynesian fashion)
it’s plugging up part of the gap left
by people not spending. While the
government couldn’t possibly save
the economy on it’s own, it’s better
that they do what they can rather
than nothing.
And it works double
because government
expenditure (by the
very nature of what
they spend on) gen-
erally helps people. It
would be insane to cut
back on hospitals and
schools and police when
the economy is in the pan.
Right now people are most
at risk and we need a large
government looking out for
them. It will sound contra-
dictory but now the econ-
omy is shrinking, it’s the
right time to grow the
public sector.
The big problem is
that to fund the extra
spending the govern-
ment has to put itself
in debt, and debt is bad. So it’s
important that the government shrinks
after the recession ends and pays back
what it owes (because if the govern-
ment fails to keep the public balances
in order, it’ll cause a recession). One
of the biggest mistakes made by pub-
lic leaders across the world is not cut-
ting back public expense during high
growth years. Blair and Brown cer-
tainly made that mistake and it pretty
much destroyed the public finances.
So. Will the VAT cut help? Probably
not. But will the overall idea of govern-
ment borrowing help the economy?
Yes, provided we pay it all back. And
that’s the problem.
S
o there’s a recession on. The
sky’s falling, people are pan-
icking and the world’s go-
ing to end and stuff. But it’s
not all doom and gloom you
know. There are good things to reces-
sions, namely stuff gets cheaper.
Right now house prices are crashing,
and all the property people are very,
very upset – or are they? Property is a
long term game where you have to plan
for years and years ahead.
For example, the Imperial College
property managers consider property
investment over a 100-year term. That
means that the college looks 100 years
ahead when considering whether to
buy or sell sites. Seriously. Over the
summer there was concern that the
college was going to sell a certain piece
of land off to a private investor. The
land in question would be a prime de-
velopment spot, but legislation means
that it can’t be built on for the next 50
years or so. Any private landholder
would have sold the site in the blink of
an eye but because the college has such
a long term view on the world, it kept
the site and in 50 years don’t be sur-
prised if Imperial gets a new building
in South Ken.
Old dogs in the building game will
point out to us youngsters that more
buildings are built during recessions
than during periods of growth. Sound
silly? It’s because big projects start get-
ting planned during the good times,
but by the time that the actual con-
structing happens, the economy has
turned.
Right now most property develop-
ment firms are posting losses, with
smaller firms going out of business
in droves. But the larger more stable
firms aren’t too worried.
In fact, a lot of them are laughing
now. The best time to buy property is
when a recession is at it’s worst. And
now that property prices are falling
there are a lot of big players out there
waiting to buy up everything they can.
Don’t be surprised to see Chinese
companies buying up huge chunks of
American cities, or private investors
gobbling up troubled companies be-
cause right now, the recession sale is
on.
Buy when the streets run red with blood
The recession isn’t a bad thing for everybody, especially for some of the people who are worst affected
And since the government is push-
ing hard to get credit into the markets
again, interest rates from government
backed banks will be nice and low in
the mid-future, making the whole ex-
ercise much, much easier.
In six months time, developers will
be able to buy up cheap property with
relatively cheap money and by the time
they’ve built their investments up, the
markets will have recovered – driving
up prices.
So as soon as you get out of univer-
sity, buy a house. Any house in London
or a nearby suburb. Then get a fixed
low interest mortgage from a govern-
ment backed bank and wait for the
prices to rise. You won’t regret it.
But Brown’s plan will. Here are four reasons why:
“Cameron has
been painting the
government’s
plans as bad
without suggesting
any alternatives”
“As soon as you
leave uni, buy
a house, any
house in London.
Then wait for
prices to rise.
You won’t regret
it”

T
he 3rd of December was
another successful day for
the Teddy Bear Hospital n
Chelsea and Westminster
Hospital in Fullham.
The Teddy Bear Hospital is a project
promoted by Medsin (a network of stu-
dents interested in health care matters)
which aims to diminish children’s fear
of hospitals and doctors along with
promoting healthy living guidelines
such as healthy eating and exercising.
The project has been running inter-
nationally since 2000 but only reached
Imperial College in 2006. The soci-
ety who is in charge of TBH is EMSA
(European Medical Students Associa-
tion), which has its own branch here at
Imperial.
The last TBH organised by our medi-
cal students entertained more than 50
local year 2 schoolchildren. What the
schoolchildren had to do was to bring
their sick teddies along and have the
medical students examine and provide
treatment for them.
Medical students from all years had
the opportunity to interact with the
children in a stress-less environment
and therefore exhibited the fun per-
spective of medicine.
How does the Teddy Bear Hospital
work? Each child brings his ill teddy,
as a responsible ‘parent’, to the hospi-
tal where he presents it to the students
who get to play the teddy-doctors.
This year’s scenario even included an
ambulance setting which was basically
a tent which the teddies in need of ur-
gent medical care were transported to
via a trolley!
The children further received edu-
cation on various childhood illnesses
such as chickenpox. And yes, there
were teddies with chickenpox (attach a
few red circular stickers on and there
you go!)
The A&E station proved to fulfil the
children’s curiosity about the instru-
ments used by doctors as they got the
opportunity to play around with the
‘scary’ stuff such as oxygen masks.
Teddies that had broken bones had to
of course be taken for an X-ray. At this
station, the medical students explained
to the children what X-rays do stress-
ing the fact that they are painless.
The children were encouraged to
try and locate organs on a skeleton.
Throughout the stages the children
were actively engaged with the pres-
entation of the medical techniques
and were eager to use the instruments
themselves.
Next was the plaster station. The
teddy bears received appropriate treat-
Teddy Bears Hospital
Rosie Americanou took her sick teddy bear to report for felix
ment by having bandages applied to
their broken arms and legs. The chil-
dren were prompted to apply the band-
ages to the teddies and therefore most
of them enthusiastically covered their
teddies in bandages.
The surgery station proved to be
thrilling for most children as a muppet
surgeon operated on a critically injured
teddy. Children got to ‘scrub in’ as well
by wearing the appropriate gowns as
supplied by the students.
Before the children left, they received
instructions on healthy living habits.
The delivery of the teaching though,
was nothing but typical.
Exercising for a healthy body did not
limit to the students advising the chil-
dren but also made use of the medical
students’ dancing skills. They danced
together to the well known Macare-
na dance routine. Furthermore, the
healthy eating station provided fresh
fruits and smoothies for the children
whilst explaining the benefits of a
healthy diet.
The children enjoyed the experience
and curiosity and enthusiasm was sub-
stituted for the fear of hospitals all too
common among children. Thanks to
days like these, who knows: perhaps
some of these kids will be qualified
doctors in 20 years time!
