Last June, when most Imperial students
were celebrating the end of exams with
copious amounts of lash, Imperial
Cycling Club headed off to take part
in one of Europe’s biggest mountain
bike races. The idea was simple; the
Mountain mayhem 24 Hours
David Martin
The last six months have been busy for
IC Kendo Club with various events and
important guests. One evening in July
saw a group of eight 7th and 8th dan
sensei, on a visit from Japan, and their
equally graded hosts at Imperial to run
a training session. This included some
one-on-one coaching and a ji-geiko
that devastated even the most hard-
ened participants.
Although Kendo is not an Olym-
pic sport, each country has a national
team. With a view to the upcoming
World Kendo Championship in Bra-
zil, on October 25th/26th the Greek
national team and their 5th Dan Japa-
nese sensei visited London in order
to practice and gain experience with
the British national squad. Both days,
members of ICKC took part at the
joint practice that lasted more than six
hours and helped their teams during
an unofficial but extremely competi-
tive stand off.
Following a very interesting five
member team shiai (match) between
both men’s and women’s national
teams, a three hour normal practice
led by the 7th Dan GB national coach
alongside all the visiting higher grade
senseis, gave precious advice and en-
couragement to all the participants.
Finally, on November 15th, the club
sent nine competitors (and many vol-
unteers) to the Mumeishi 3’s, the larg-
est and most important kendo taikai
(competition) in Britain. This year,
the 35th of this prestigious competi-
tion, featured contestants from as far
apart as Tel Aviv, Lithuania, Japan and
Malta. ICKC had three members in
the morning Ladies’ competition that
all made it to the second round before
being knocked out. Rachel Soon had
the misfortune to be drawn against the
eventual winner.
The two teams in the afternoon’s
competition were quickly dispatched
in their first rounds, the A team by a
trio of Frenchmen only one of whom
had double the years of experience of
all three members of the Imperial team
combined. The quality of some of the
kendo displayed throughout the day
was incredibly high and Imperial ac-
quitted themselves well.
IC kendo club visited by world class fighters
team of that completed the most laps
in 24 hours would win. Friday night
was spent prepping bikes and discuss-
ing team tactics around the makeshift
barbeque.
Race day dawned overcast and damp.
Unlike most teams we spent the morn-
ing fuelling up for the race and opted
out of a quick lap of the course, figur-
ing that we would know where to go in
the race itself. The team was divided
over how best to prepare food wise,
with Roger and I adopting the ‘eat loads
of jacket potatoes and Jaffa cakes’ ap-
proach, and Dave T and James sticking
to the scientific ‘consume only energy
gels’ reasoning.
As two o’clock approached, James,
full of weird nutrients and electrolytes,
took up his place on the start line. The
race began with a one-kilometre jog to
get to your bike, and at 2 o’clock the
race began. James delivered a solid
first lap of 1 hour, 8 minutes, but reck-
oned that the traffic jams leading up
to the snaking, off camber singletrack
sections of the course had cost him a
lot of time. And so the evening wore
on with all of us consistently lapping
around the 1 hour mark. By the time
Roger headed out for his 2nd lap, dark-
ness had fallen, and tiny dots of light lit
up the valley sides as riders made their
way around the course.
We were holding steady around
250th position overall, sandwiched be-
tween Dave and Gay Pride, and keep-
ing pace with Oxford and Cambridge
in the University class. The Loughbor-
ough A and B teams were a long way
ahead at this point, however just after
midnight the rain came.
At the hand over whilst waiting for
Dave T, riders were talking about parts
of the course collapsing and turning
into rivers of slow moving mud. The
fact that Dave was taking so long to
emerge seemed to reinforce the fact the
chaos had broken out on some parts of
the course. After a ninety-minute lap,
Dave emerged carrying his bike. A big
crash on the final part of the course
had sent his derailleur into the spokes,
destroying his drive train, thus ending
Dave’s race. I set off into the night at
about one that morning, and experi-
enced the worst two and a half hours
I have ever had on a bike. The rain had
stopped, but the mud had turned into
sticky, wheel jamming gloop. Some of
the early singletrack had indeed fallen
away into a greasy slope, generally with
a group of mountain bikers stuck at the
bottom.
The 2nd part of the course was
drier, however I had only charged my
lights to do two hours, and just when
I thought things were improving, my
lights failed a couple of kilometres
from the changeover. When I finally
made it back, not only was Roger wait-
ing, but James was there as well waiting
for Roger to hand over to him. Roger
set off into the slowly drying night, for
two more hours of hell.
When Roger finally returned, dawn
had broken, and the course had started
to dry out. Dave was up and frantically
trying to get hold of a new derailleur,
and my bike had similar mechanical is-
sues, not to mention the commitment
to the race issues I was having after
my last lap. James, in a desperate bid
to stay in the race completed a heroic
two-lap stint in just over three hours.
The antics of the night had moved us
into the top 200 overall, and we were
still in the battle for 3rd place with Ox-
ford and Cambridge. With Dave T’s
bike on the road to recovery, he and
Roger put in a lap more each to bring
us within a couple of hours of the fin-
ish. Dave T handed over to me, only
for my bike to break before I even got
on the course. Roger stepped in get-
ting another solid lap in the bag, before
handing back to Dave T, who put in
the fastest lap of the race to bring us
home only one lap off the universities
podium, and a devastating 12 minutes
behind Cambridge in fourth.
Solid start for IC futsal
Thank you very much for meeting
with felix sports today Catherine!
First things first - how has your
season been so far?
Err, so far in ULU it has been good -
we have been doing really, really well.
But BUCS has been a different story it
has been difficult since we lost a lot of
players last year. Three final years who
were key players graduated last year so
we now have a fresh young team. Eve-
ryone is doing really well and we are
improving match by match. I am happy
at the moment
So as I understand it, you are in
the same league as the College
netball 1sts?
Well we are in the same ULU league
but in one league above them in BUCS.
I think Imperial got promoted last
season.
So how are you faring in BUCS?
We are currently bottom! We need to
win two out of the last three games to
stay up basically. It is doable and eve-
ryone will have to play really well. But
it is doable. However there are only six
teams in our league and two go down,
so it changes quite a lot every season.
So you have beaten IC already
this year I hear...
Last Monday, yeah, a good game and
a good victory for us!
Any more grudge match games
against IC before Varsity?
I think that is the only game and it is
quite early on to tell to be honest. For us
it was a nice boost. Everyone tends to
improve a lot as the season progresses
and as both teams have very changed
squads it is very hard to tell.
So rate your chances, give me a
score line for Varsity!
If we can get a similar score as we
did on Monday I will be very happy!
[Medicals won 28-8]. I think it will be a
lot closer, due to the fact that Varsity is
one of those days when everyone feels
the pressure and everyone picks up
their game. So anything can happen.
Last year the first couple of quarters
were very close, but we are confident.
So at the moment you are obvi-
ously a cut above the College
team, but how would you say
that the ICSM netballers off-pitch
antics compare?
Off-pitch we have a really social club
at the moment because as well we also
have four teams in the club. So we have
a massive range of abilities and they all
turn up to the weekly socials. We have
circles every Wednesday and we have a
close mix with the ICSM football boys.
We do events with them including a
tour, more of a drinking tour! This year
we hope to do more of a playing tour as
well. We are really sociable!
Where are you planning to go on
tour this year?
Cardiff on the 20th of February. Just
before Varsity! So if we don’t play as
well that is probably why! Although it
is definitely a warm up tournament for
Varsity... we do always play the foot-
ballers at netball... and we always win!
So you have four teams? That
must be hugely beneficial for the
first team to have that depth in
the club to bring players up if
needed?
Massively so! The fourth team is new
and we have only had it for a couple
of seasons and they are only in ULU
at the moment. Hopefully we will be
able to push the thirds and seconds
up in the BUCS leagues and then we
can hopefully get the fourth team into
BUCS as well. That would really help
up the numbers.
Week 4 in the build up to 25th February 2009. This week, Jack Cornish interviews the ICSM 1st XI Captain
Catherine Atkin
What would you say if there were
plans to combine College and the
Medical Schools sports teams
into one ‘superclub’?
It would be very good. But I also think
it would be difficult. The timings for us
to play with them would be awkward
with the differing commitments. Plus I
love being a medic, so I would say NO!
So moving on from Netball, who
else do you think are doing well
this season?
Erm... At the moment I think every
team, medics wise, are in quite tough
divisions and it seams that it is show-
ing in BUCS. But everyone is working
really hard. Our seconds and thirds are
doing really well in BUCS at the mo-
ment. I know that the rugby boys have
had quite a change this season in play-
ers so that they are having a tough sea-
son. I am not really sure about the oth-
er teams to be honest. I think generally
everyone is having a tough season
- I don’t think there is anyone top
of their BUCS league at the mo-
ment. I think that most teams
are mid table maintaining their
position in the higher leagues.
Who do you think will win
the rugby at Varsity?
Medics...I think they will. Last
year was an amazing game, very
exciting. But the Medics still won
in the end. It is the end score that
counts. There was a tiny, tiny
moment of sheer panic for the
medics. But we were just lull-
ing you into a false sense of
security!
What is your favour-
ite anti-IC chant for
Varsity?
I am not a fan of
the chants because in
my first year some-
one chucked a pint
of snakebite on my
head from the top
of the stands!
Do you think
that once you
have gained
promoted
that it is easy
to maintain
your place
and qual-
ity in that
division?
I think that
if you have
been promoted
you should be
good enough to
be in the league
above - surely
that is the point
of promotion! But
then again you
need to sustain
and improve within
that league. You can
then develop the
skills needed for the
league above and
you should be able to
continue going up.
A true netball aficionado, Catherine has moved
throughout the top roles in the Medicals Netball Club
and is now leading a young first team in a difficult
BUCS league. A utility player, she fills the positions
where there are gaps, allowing her team mates to
excel in their preferred roles. We spoke to her just
before she took her team away to Chichester in an
important BUCS South East 1A match.

Do you not think that depends
on the league you get promoted
into? The lower leagues seem to
be very similar, but when you get
to the top do you not feel that
the higher leagues are for those
universities that focus on sports
so for us it is a lot more difficult?
I would personally say, netball wise,
I think we are in the highest division
we could realistically get to. We are in
1A and there is only one division above
us and those teams train five times a
week. That would near impossible to
get ten people willing to do that or
even able to do that while trying to get
a degree at IC. So in the premiership
you are competing against teams from
sporting universities with players who
are in the England development squad.
It is impossible to have seven players
who are that good with minimal
training.
Do you think the union should
concentrate on sporting excel-
lence or purely on participation?
At our university participation is key.
It fills the social side of university life. I
think you need a mixture between the
two. It is more difficult at a university
where sport is not going to make you
any better at your degree. Let’s say you
were doing sports science, sporting ex-
cellence can be up to 20%-30% of your
degree. You would need to do that
practical side.
Do you think there are teams out
there that the College should
start focussing on?
I think if you went through and found
out who is high up on BUCS. Obvious-
ly it is difficult when you have so many
team sports to fund. I don’t know about
the individual sports - squash, badmin-
ton...? I’m not really sure.
Do you think there should be
more focus on other sports
at Varsity rather than just the
rugby?
Yes I do - ideally I think all the
sports should be played at the
same place but obviously with
netball in Ethos you can’t get
everyone together. I think all
the advertising is good - I
made sure I was not in the
promotional photos!
I you couldn’t
play netball on
a Wednesday
for whatever
reason, what
would you be
doing?
My life
would be
over! I
would
definite-
ly do
another
team
sport,
something
like hockey
or lacrosse.
Definitely an
all girls team
sport.

IC Netball have stepped
up to the mark this week and
posed for page three...so give us
a date!
We actually did the naked calendar
for ICSM in my first year... I am sure
some of the girls would be up for it!
And finally, the standard ques-
tion: what is orienteering?
They have a map, a compass and
have to run around the countryside
and get to checkpoints and stuff.
Wet, rainy and horrible.
Anything else you want to say?
I love netball...that’s about all!
It all started on a cold Sunday morning,
ICUAFC setting off at 0700 hours try-
ing once again to overcome its biggest
adversity; injustice. Lion-O, actually
from the Thundercats, drove the fun
bus to their destination, the University
of Sussex.
With a squad of just seven, having
just one hours practice (albeit with the
wrong players) 48 hours prior to Sun-
day, would prove a challenge to emerge
from the BUCS South-East Regional
Futsal Qualifiers with a positive result.
The tournament was set up with five
ofthetenparticipatinguniversitiespro-
gressing through to the BUCS Cham-
pionships in Sheffield taking place next
March. In this first day Imperial had to
play Hertfordshire 1s, Surrey 1s and
Kingston 1s (the match against Buck-
inghamshire New University, our final
group opponent will take place on the
second day of the regionals in February
2009), teams that currently reside in a
league above ICUAFC 1st XI.
Hertfordshire were our first op-
ponents. They were well trained and
went one-nil up quickly with a quick
one-two down the middle and a tap in
at the back stick. IC were quick to re-
ply with a goal from Portuguese hero,
Goncalo Pires, who decided dribbling
his man once wasn’t enough so embar-
rassed the same player three times be-
fore smashing it in the roof of the net.
In the second half Hertfordshire
came back stronger. The referee de-
cided to help them not once but four
times in a row. Firstly, a dodgy free kick
was given on the halfway line that got
played wide to a player who dribbled
the ball out of bounds. Though, the
referee chose not only to not to see it
but to give another suspect free kick in
a threatening position. Hertfordshire
smashed it wide, but that wasn’t good
enough for the referee and he decided
to make them retake it. The goal was
duly scored and unsurprisingly, play
resumed.
IC were 2-1 down and heads dropped
due to the flagrant refereeing. Hert-
fordshire, unfazed, took advantage and
scored again on the counter. Irvine
“The Pimp” Howson then restored or-
der by playing a ball down the left to
Pires who squared it to Gui who found
himself in front of an open goal. He
then took a touch to tee himself up
but unfortunately got tackled, but the
failed clearance landed on Irv who
struck it (first time) into the back of the
net to make the final score 3-2.
Not the best of starts, but it showed
the IC had potential. Kingston, the
next opponents were more physical.
This didn’t detract from the fact that it
was a must win game for IC. Squirrel
put IC in the lead within two minutes.
Gui riskily played with possession at
the back and quickly lost it to the op-
posing striker who equalised after tak-
ing it round the keeper. A play by Lion-
O down the left resulted in IC’s second
goal of the match.
At this point it became clear that Im-
perial were the better side. They were
passing it across the back doing nice
rotations and adopting a strong 2-2
zonal defence strategy. Things seemed
going IC’s way until a mix up in goal
led to Kingston’s equaliser. A long ball
thrown by their goalkeeper into ICs
penalty box caused panic with Milky
and Z’mon colliding leaving their strik-
er to poke it in.
At this point the game became even
until Irv came on and kept his ‘Pimp
Hand’ strong. After collecting Milky’s
goal kick, he ran past all the opposition
players and slotted it in to regain the
lead. Kingston managed to equalise to
leave the score at 3 apiece.
After a few minutes of pressure King-
ston lose it and start fouling IC players
to stop the flowing champagne fut-
sal. This led to the first penalty. Pires
stepped up to the plate but hit the bar.
IC get another penalty and this time
Gui punts it top left to make it 4-3.
Kingston looked completely out of
place and just couldn’t handle the fit-
ness and movement by the players in
blue. Yet another penalty was given.
Squirrel stepped up but also struck the
bar. No problem though as Damian
soon after blasted in two goals and Gui
completed his hat-trick to make the
score 8-3. Kingston recover and take
it to 8-5 but Lion-O shattered them
of any hope by scoring his second and
making it 9-5, which is how it finished.
Imperial finished the day second in
their group and wait to play their final
opponents followed by the final play-
offs in February 2009.
