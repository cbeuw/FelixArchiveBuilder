C
hristmas - regardless of
your religious belief - is
something that most peo-
ple look forward to, but
not so much during the
weeks before then with the shopping
rush. Hopefully my list of recommen-
dations the week before had made your
life slightly easier, but if you were look-
ing for something more special then
please read on.
If you recall my Stuff Live article a
few weeks back, I mentioned a cool
company called DIGISKIN who offers
a revolutionary way of personalising
your gadget - it could be a com-
puter mouse, a mobile
phone, a laptop, a game
console, a camera etc.
It caught my attention
because not only
do they provide a
skinning solution
that beats the
ordinary fugly
silicone (not to
be confused
with silicon,
as most people
do) skins by miles,
but also the finish
looks as if the gadget was
customised just for you by the
original manufacturer.
The process is quick and simple, just
as I had witnessed at the expo: start-
ing with the customer selecting an art-
work from the company’s catalogue of
nearly 2000 designs, or you can even
submit your own high resolution pic-
ture and tell DIGISKIN how to resize
and place it; the company then prints
the artwork out onto a thin foil of just
0.05mm thickness - bear in mind that
the average silicone case is about 2mm
thick; finally, both the skin and your
gadget are placed in one of their ma-
chines, which uses vacuum-forming
method to tightly wrap the skin onto
your gadget; any excessive foil is then
carefully removed by their well-trained
staff. All this can usually be done within
thirty minutes on the average phone.
Soon after the expo DIGISKIN’s
Managing Director, Ricardo da Silva,
got in touch with me and generously
provided a sample for my beloved
iPhone, as shown in the above picture.
At first sight it really looked like a final
touch from Apple (who would never do
such thing), instead of it donning some
cheap, thick skin. Holding it in hand
only strengthened my above thought,
as it is incredibly thin, and I also
discovered another hidden
benefit: my iPhone
is not as slip-
pery as before.
The round
edges below the
silver bezel were
wellwrapped
too – I don’t
know how
they did it but
they certainly
did well. I also did
a key-scratch test -
something that I never
asked Ricardo about - and
surprisingly the DIGISKIN
survived my strong strikes, as
witnessed by my felix colleagues.
Upon showing off my beautifully
skinned iPhone in front my colleagues,
the first reactions were all “wow” with
a smile. It definitely wasn’t to do with
the artwork (let’s face it: I could have
chosen something better, maybe some-
thing that would display my heterosex-
uality) – it was the fact that it looked
like the artwork was printed directly
on the phone. My friends were keen to
look at the phone up close to see how
thin the skin was, and unsurprisingly
they were all very impressed. If you see
me walking by on campus, feel free to
ask for a show-and-tell.
Such ingenious product and serv-
ice could only come from one of the
smartest countries in the world, a
country whose people I had always ad-
mired – Singapore. DIGISKIN is a rel-
atively young company and has spent
the past five years mostly in research
and development. Just two years ago
they opened their first store in The Ca-
thay - one of the country’s oldest shop-
ping malls, and more recently another
at the Bugis mall. Having just landed in
the UK, the ambitious company is also
heading towards USA, South Africa,
Australia, France and Indonesia.
DIGISKIN is now offering their de-
but UK service in the basement Elec-
tronics Department of Selfridges,
Oxford Street, which offers a one day
turn-around service as well as same
day, provided orders are placed before
12:00. With same-day service custom-
ers will receive their devices back by
19:30. Better yet, a flagship store is due
to open in January next year, which will
offer a much quicker service of as fast
as half an hour, and mobile phone users
will even get a loan phone during that
period. If your DIGISKIN somehow
does come loose around the corners,
the folks at either store will be happy
to reattach it for you free of charge, but
looking at mine I’m sure it will stay in
place for a good period.
Of course, the real question is “How
much?” Prices are size-dependant,
starting from £25 for something like a
mouse, but generally £35 for small de-
vices and £55 for large. As of next week
you should be able to buy DIGISKIN
gift vouchers from Selfridges, which
would make great Christmas presents
for the gadget lovers around you. Many
of you will be visiting Selfies soon any-
way, so do check out the DIGISKIN
booth while you’re there.
