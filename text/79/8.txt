REPORT OF J.S.CHESTER,THE
CHAIRMAN OF THE ATHLETIC
CLUBS COMMITTEE 1954-55
This year almost a l l clubs
report an increased membership,
which i s a favourable r e f l e c t i o n
on the a t h l e t i c interests of t h i s
year's intake of Freshmen. Seven
out of sixteen U.L. Championship
Cups have found t h e i r way into the
Imperial College Trophy cases,
although t h i s i s fewer than l a s t
year, i t i n no way detracts from the
fact that we have had another
successful year i n the f i e l d of
Sport.
The R i f l e Club had t h e i r most
successful year ever. The College
team shot i n the Inter-University
league and won f o r the second time
in three years. We won i n the London
University league f o r the f i f t h
successive year - p r a c t i c a l l y a
mohopoly.
The Judo Club have also done
great things and l o s t only one match
in ten. They are perhaps one of the
best teams i n the country and have
beaten both Oxford and Cambridge
U n i v e r s i t i e s .
The boat club reports a most
successful year, i n the Winter term
they sometimes ran us many as twelve
eights, and t h i s term had a record
of four eights and one four racing
on the same day. Five pots were
c o l l e c t e d by the club during the
Vinter regattas, and i n the Head of
the River Race the Club as a whole
improved on l a s t year's r e s u l t s , and
the f i r s t eight brought home the
U. L. Head of the River Cup. This
term the four racing eights are a l l
rowing extremely w e l l and at the
U n i v e r s i t y Regatta the f i r s t eight
won the Allom Cup and the second and
fourth eights won i n t h e i r d i v i s -
ions. The f i r s t two eights are
rowing i n a l l the regattas between
now and the end of the Summer and
the f i r s t eight f i n i s h at Henley,
'
.
V
e wish them every success.
The Rugby Club had an average
season and although the U.L. 15-a-
sides eluded thein, they were con-
soled by winning the U.L. 7-a-side
cup f o r t h e f i r s t time. The club i s
to be congratulated on t h e i r i n i t -
i a t i v e i n organising an Easter tour
of Cornwall, where, to say the l e a s t ,
they by no means disgraced them-
selves.
The Hockey and Soccer clubs
were again eluded by the g l i t t e r . o f
s i l v e r cups although both clubs
report successful seasons. The
Hockey Club concluded the season
with a tour to Holland, where they
lost only one match i n ten.
International Relations were
again enforced oy the Badminton
Club's successful tour to Germany,
a f t e r winning the Larcome Cup f o r
the f o u r t h successive year.
The Fencing Club had a season
i n which? out of 9 matches and the
U.L. Team Championship were won. The
climax was the defeat of King's
College who have been undefeated i n
t h i s U n i v e r s i t y f o r a long period.
The Golf Team and the f i r s t
Cricket XI both have excellent rec-
ords and to date remain unbeaten.
The Cross Country Club are to
be congratulated on successfully
organising the Road Relay Race, i n
which 30 teams competed, and t h i s
College came fourth. Both the Cross
Country and the A t h l e t i c teams were
runners-up for the Univensity Champ-
ionships.
Of the other clubs, the Boxing
Club was reformed t h i s year a f t e r
a year's i n a c t i v i t y and came 4th. i n
the University Championship. The
S a i l i n g Club ( the present holders
of the Links Memorial Trophy ) have
increased i n strength and won the
U.L.points Championship i n t h e i r new
boat, and were unlucky not to win the
team Championship.
The squash and Table Tennis
Clubs report successful years and
the Lawn Tennis Club are doing w e l l .
The Swimming Club convincingly won
the University Polo League, l o s i n g
only 2 out of 15matches, and although
they gained as many points as l a s t
year i n the Swimming Championships,
they were squeezed into t h i r d place.
At the beginning of the year
in my introductory speech to fresh
freshers, I was heard to say one
club was no concern of mine.
Unconcerned by my lack of attention,
Imperial CollegeWomen's Sports
Club have exploited t h e i r a t h l e t i c
talents i n the f i e l d of hockey,
netball,badminton,squash,swimming,

The Imperial College Gliding
Club's Skylark Et was delivered i n
Juno. Within a month i t broke both
the B r i t i s h Local Gain of Height,
and Local Absolute Altitude records.
Derek Piggott took up the
Skylark, released at 2000 feet, and
c i r c l e d up into a very black cloud.
In a few minutes he was at 18'000
feet. He straightened up but flew
into more l i f t , and i n the true
s p i r i t of a g l i d e r p i l o t he began
to c i r c l e . Some tine Jaterhe found
himself at 15'000 feet. I n t h a t t i m e
he had been to an estimated height
of 2.V0Q0 feet, although the baro-
graph chart only showed 23'200
feet, the oen having gone o f f the
top of the chart.

Dear S i r ,
One look at our e d i t o r
t h i s term reminds uo of the subject
of long-vacation beards. Not only
he and other Rugby players, bat
also l a s t year's I.C. President
and Secretary sprouted f o r t h while
i n Yugoslavia. The former was f o r -
c i b l y shaved out the l a t t e r had fhe
nerve t o appear i n h i s f o r a few
days at College. The ex-Chairman
of the S.C.C. may be pardoned as
he v i s i t e d a very cold country, but
I hope a l l those, who do not reg-
u l a r l y a r r i v e i n red fungus, w i l l
soon make themselves recognisable
again. I've only to see Andy Levine
in a beard, and X s h a l l f e e l that
I have seen everything.
Yours,
D.J.H.
He cannot remember nuch of
t h i s as he was s u f f e r i n g from a
serious lack of oxygen (normally
required above 15^000 feet) and
he was i n severe pain due to
e l e c t r i c shocks from the controls.
Before he landed, about one and
a quarter hours a f t e r take o f f , he
performed some acrobatics - j o i e
de v i v e - but on inspecting the
g l i d e r was h o r r i f i e d to see the
damage caused by the storm. The
leading edge of the wings was badly
dented due to h a i l stones, f a b r i c
had been ripped from the t a i l
surfaces and nose, and lightening
had struck the canopy causing a
crack. I t required 100 man-hours t o
repatr the a i r c r a f t . ,
It has now been decided to c a l l
the g l i d e r "Phoenix", appropriate
not only because of i t s connection
with Imperial College, but also
because i t "rose l i k e a Phoenix
from the flames".
a t h l e t i c s , table tennis, fencing
and rowing. In the winter term
an appreciable f r a c t i o n of the
n e t b a l l teams which played on a
Saturday morning was o f t e n required
to play hockey i n the afternoon on
the other side of London. For the
f i r s t time a team entered the
U.L,Swimming championship and came
4th out of 11 e n t r i e s , the newly
formed boat club entered the
University Women's fours and were
placed ,4th out of 9. Their greatest
success, however, i s i n the f i e l d of
a t h l e t i c s , not only have they won
the U.L. f a c t o r cup which i s a handi-
cap event based on the number of
club members, but they also won the
Imperial College Challenge Cup - a
very fine team e f f o r t . Four members
of I.C.Ut'.S.C. have played f o r U.L.
teams t h i s year,
I would l i k e to thank a l l the
members of the A t h l e t i c s Clubs who
helped to organise the Harllngton
Nov. 5th. celebrations and the Fun
F a i r at the Sports Day Hop. As
a result of our Sports thy appeal
£30 was sent to tho B r i t i s h Univer-
s i t y Sports Board to help finance
the International Student Games at
San Sebastian. I have since heard
that four members of t h i s College
are on the probables l i s t to
represent B r i t i s h U n i v e r s i t i e s at
these games.
I can r e s p e c t f u l l y report on
behalf of my Committee, that the
A t h l e t i c Clubs have had a good year
and have enchanced the sporting
prestige of Imperial College,
s o c i a l l y and on the f i e l d of
play both at home and abroad.
