FRESHMEN ARE A NUISANCE.THERE
CAN BE NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. Ranging

you-once type who loves bursting
i n on the Prof's lecture; they are
a l l outcasts. Generally speaking,
that i s . But t h i s year, at t h i s
College, you are going to. f i n d a
number of old-timers reduced* to the
ranks.
During the past year we have
been tossed around from one r e f e c t -
ory to another, from one Hop-base
to another, u n t i l we're as green as
you are. We've been awakened by a i r
compressors so early -for so long
that we hate the Diesel Cycle. And
we know that we're coming back to
the same thing f o r yet another year.
We ' re looking forward to i t , just as
you are; perhaps moreso, because
although l i f e i s s l i g h t l y hectic
and unpredictable at the moment
(even the Brown-Baggers are being
s t i r r e d from t h e i r lethargy), we
have a s u r p r i s i n g l y large number of
pleasant memories of last year at
Imperial College.
In other f i e l d s , however, i n t -
erest was greater than ever before.
Mines was waking up to the fact that
i t h a d n ' t a mascot, whereas Guilds'
has boasted a 1901 James and Brown
named Boanerges ("Bo") who regular-
l y competes i n , and completes,the
Brighton Run.
Mines therefore bought a Tra-
c t i o n engine (Clementine) , which
a f t e r a vast amount of work by a
few people was f i n a l l y persuaded
to move under i t s own power. Many
people f e e l that a p i t pony would
have been much more appropriate.
Later i n the season R.C,S.(pronoun-
ced R.C.S.) decided to buy a 1916
Dennis fire-engine. This, i n view
of the unstable nature of experim-
ents conducted i n the domain of Pure
Science, was generally considered
to be a good purchase, apart from
the fact that the engine's pump blew
up i n the 1920's, and tne big-ends
have a habit of going.
Whilst on the subject of mas-
cots, we must mention Herbert, our
Phoenix. He i s I.CJs o f f i c i a l mas-
cot and was abducted i n the t r a d i t -
ional s t y l e by N.E.C. (enn-ee-see)
last Christmas. About the same time
The Sports-Day Hop, which was
held i n a i d of B.U.S.B., was a huge
success thanks to the e f f o r t s of
I.C.W.A.(The I.C. Women's Associa-
t i o n ) and others who hadn't ruined
themselves i n the f i e l d of sport
during the afternoon. Much has been
w r i t t e n i n these columns on the
subject of Hops. Much more w i l l be
w r i t t e n . The best thing you can do
i s to go and f i n d out f o r yourself.
From Hops we pass on to the subject
of the sedate (well, at f i r s t ) C o l l -
ege R a i l ,
Last year, due to the death of S i r
Roderic H i l l , there was no Commem-
oration Day B a l l . Commemoration Day
i s an annual event, commemorating
the v i s i t of King George VI to our
College. An Easter B a l l was held,
however, l a s t year at Claridges,
during the whole of one night. This
was a most l a v i s h a f f a i r , including
an impromptu and,indeed,an unwitting
Cabaret display by c e r t a i n gentlemen
who were engaged i n painting an
adjacent lounge.
Each one of the three Colleges
in I.C. holds i t s own evening dress

word formal, f o r reasons which be-

Left: Mike Neale, last
years president of
I.C. Union: he had
the difficult task
of trying to console
I.C. students after
the N.E.C. robbery.
Right: Clementine ,
R. S. M. mascot, and
winner of the Curtis
Cup at the Appleford
Traction Engine Meet.
We had a f i n e team of O f f i c i a l s
to s t a r t October, 19S4. With Mike
Neale as President of the Union:
Mike has since l e f t and Jim Ander-
son has taken over. Vere Atkinson
was Union Secretary l a s t year, and
W.G, Kitchener has succeeded him

Pete Lemir,, Bob Kingdon and Andy
Levine had things w e l l organised
from the start . The O f f i c i a l side
of things was i n fact run so smooth-

At least, so the attendance at Union
Meetings would suggest.

the kind donation of trousers by
O f f i c i a l s of our College.
The mention of Hops reminds me
that I intended to write a few words
about them. These are Saturday night
a f f a i r s (forwant of a better word)
where you pay a nominal two s h i l l i n g s
and then shoulder the woman of your
choice through a quickstep. Many
Societies held Hops last year, one
of the most outstanding, of course,
was the FELIX Birthday Hop, at which
a party of Amazons from Q.E.C. kind-
ly presented us with the aforment-
ioned carrot.

hard working botanists, the poor
souls who l i v e there. For the bene-
f i t of those who have to do the same
next year, I point out that there
are at least seven Pubs within a

You w i l l , as term progresses,
hear the mysterious word "Carnival"
whispered i n a dark corner. Some
say the word with awe; some with
