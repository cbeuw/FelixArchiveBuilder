THE IMPERIAL COLLEGE NEWSPAPER
This FELIX i s something of a
t r i a l . As f a r as we know, the lay-
out of three (and not two) columns
with r i g h t hand j u s t i f i c a t i o n (an
O.K. word f o r t h i s year) has not
been used i n t h i s paper before. I t
probably w i l l not be used again.
Papers l i k e Sennet receive a
large bonus, grant, or whatever
you care to c a l l i t to a s s i s t them
f i n a n c i a l l y . We have a just pride
in being the only unsubsidised
Newspaper ( we repeat ; Newspaper)
in the University of London. What

the Administration; i n fact , the

Returning to Imperial College
a f t e r a vacation spent f a r away, we
were surprised that two innovations
had come into being. F i r s t l y , we
are not w r i t i n g i n FELIX as he was
last term. Some w i l l wonder whether
the paper i s stepping backwards i n
the d i r e c t i o n of SENNET. We are
t o l d , however, that the loss of
those endearing l i t t l e typing mis-
takes and ragged edged columns
w i l l not affect the character of
FELIX. Judge f o r yourself.... i f
you f e e l l i k e w r i t i n g to the
Editor about i t , don't p u l l any
punches.
The second surprise i s that
some U n i v e r s i t y Union O f f i c i a l
has deemed,it necessary that every
member of L.U. should have a spec-
i a l Union card which he would have
to produce i n order to gain admit-
tance to the U.L.U. B u i l d i n g . The
reason f o r t h i s Gestapo-like move
appears to be that i n the past the
f a c i l i t i e s have been misused by
outsiders. At l e a s t , they saem to
think that i t may be outsiders, but
regretably there i s a hooligan e l -
ement i n the U n i v e r s i t y . However,
a f t e r c a r e f u l consideration i n the
aopropriate quarter, these new
Union cards have been issued, and
anybody who wants to enter must
produce one on demand. To the
enquiry as to what i s wrong with
the i n d i v i d u a l College Union cards
the reply i s : "The doorkeepers can't
recognise them". What i s wrong with
the idea of keeping f a c s i m i l e s of
a l l the London Colleges1
Union cards
at hand f o r the doorkeepers ' r e f e r -
ence? That might be a l i t t l e
cheaper than the c o s t l y business of
p r i n t i n g thousands of these i d e n t -
i t y cards. We hear that they are
intending to p r i n t them i n d i f f e r -
ent colours every year. This may or
may not be t r u e , but each student
w i l l have his name and number. I f
student money i s involved i n the
financing of t h i s operation, i t
is an outrageous m i s d i r e c t i o n of
funds that are i n great demand f o r
much more worthwhile projects. To
the point that may be put forward
that not a l l colleges have t h e i r
own union cards, the answer i s that
they only might be provided with
some proof of t h e i r membership of
U.L.U.
This innovation smacks of a
worst type of bureaucracy, we s h a l l
be r e q u i r i n g passports next i n ord-
er to enter lectures! Every stud-
ent who i s issued with one of these
a t r o c i t i e s ought to tear i t up. Worse
regulations i n the same stupid vein
may follow.

BOOK REVIEW
"THE SOARING PILOT" by Ann and
Lorne Welch and F.G.Irving. Pub-
l i s h e d by John Murray at 15/-.
Glancing through t h i s book,
one i s struck by the neatness and
c l a r i t y of both photographs and
diagrams. The f i r s t f i v e chapters,
written by Frank Irving, are more
of a t e c h n i c a l discussion than the
l a t e r ones by Ann and Lorne Welch*
Frank's s t y l e of w r i t i n g i s remin-
iscent of E.J.Holinyard: In the cock-
p i t . , "two or three inches of width
w i l l prevent that sense of f r u s t r a -
t i o n which attends s i t t i n g on an
inaccessible packet of c i g a r e t t e s " ;
and the diagram on page 36 could
have come equally as w e l l from
i'.Gamesmanshin" as from "The Soaring
P i l o t " .
The non-technical g l i d e r enth-
usiast may f i n d these f i r s t f i v e
chapters rather heavy going, but he
w i l l be w e l l rewarded by the abund-
ance of ready w i t . This wit i s not
confined to Frank1
s w r i t i n g , and i f
the reader feels i n c l i n e d to read
the l a t e r chapters f i r s t , l e t him
choose the eighth;Landing i n F i e l d s .
Here* he w i l l f i n d a most unusual
and yet a sensible, c o l l e c t i o n of
data ranging from the q u a l i t y of
meadowland to a short discussion
on animal behaviour.
By and large, t h i s i s an ex-
tremely informative and w e l l written
book. It should do much to increase
the popularity of G l i d i n g i n t h i s
country.
Come on, Frank, now write a
decent text-book on Aerodynamics!
