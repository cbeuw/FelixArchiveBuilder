, Union President A LEfTER from THE PRESIDENT
James Anderson name up i n '50,
took a second i n Physios, and i s
now a t h i r d year Post-Oroduate i n
spectroscopy. His career i s l i t t -
ered with the usual landmarks which
make a man f i t to lead one of the
largest Colleges i n the country, He
was head boy at Rutherford School,
Newcastle, and has been President
of R.C.S., l,C. Soccer Captain, and
a member of Council f o r two years.
He has hewn timber on a vacations!
Job i n Finland! attended S c i e n t i f i c
Conferences i n Sweden! played Soccer
in Germany, and done one or two other
things i n France. At one time, Jim
was Sports Editor of FELIX, His i n -
terests are unusually broadi i n fact
here l i e s h i s peculiar genius, He
never pretends to knowledge which
ho does not possess, being the
World's Worst Liferoan, and consequ-
ently, since most people are only
too eager to a i r t h e i r ignorance,
he generally l i s t e n s rather than
talks i thus he knows everything that
is going on i n the Union, and i s i n
excellent touch with student opinion.
Every President of I,C. has an
arduous task. He i s burdened by a
huge v a r i e t y of committees, with
nerhaps a meeting per day throughout
his reign. He must lend his O f f i c i a l
presence to many s o c i a l functions
throughout the University, This year
there i a n special problem,
The Union showedmany signs of
d i s i n t e g r a t i o n last year. Each Club
and Society functioned as well as
over (although not, to an old ob-
server, better) but a cooperate
Union s p i r i t was absent, Union meet-
ings were disorderly shambles, end
often not worth attending. There
were no Rags. From previous exper-
ience of hooligan students, the
Senate was J u s t i f i e d ( i n i t s own
view) i n banning Rags. But,from our
point of view, i t was not. Our s p i r i t
has been sapped. Our constituent
Colleges have not been united i n
any o r i g i n a l and harmlessly eccen-
t r i c a c t i v i t y since the V i c t o r i a
Rising of March 1983. In another
year the Rag t r a d i t i o n w i l l be l o s t
for ever, and shortly a f t e r , per-
haps l i k e our present chemists, we
s h a l l " v o l u n t a r i l y " work on Wednes-
day afternoon,
It i s an accident of time that
Jim Anderson has to face t h i s crux
in our a f f a i r s . I f he succeeds no
better than his predecessors, he
w i l l f a i l . But he i s experienced
and informed; he prefers common
sense to the Blue Book, and he has
the blessed g i f t of f o r t h r i g h t hon-
esty and s i n c e r i t y which w i l l ensure
for h i s counsels respect and atten-
t i o n .
AS A PRESIDENT, HE CANNOT BE
BAD. CAN HE BE GREAT?

I consider the f o l l o w i n g points
an e s s e n t i a l guide to the student
who i s aiming t*' derive the utmost
benefit from h i s stay at Imperial
College.
1) . Use the Un«en f a c i l i t i e s to
t h e i r f u l l e s t advantage.
2) . Attend H a l l Dinner as frequently
as p o s s i b l e ^
3) . Attend one o l the Formal Dances
during the term.
4) . Indulge i n sow* a t h l e t i c active
i t y on Wednesday afternoons.
5) . J o i n one of the s o c i a l clubs.
There are many people i n the
College who only use the Union as a
Restaurant ana never take part i n
Union a f f a i r s , These are the moronic
technologists of tomorrow. The c u l -
t u r a l and s o c i a l a c t i v i t i e s of the
Union help to combat t h i s narrowing
of Interests, wMeh *is the e v i l i n
s p e c i a l i s a t i o n , feeing ever present,
these a c t i v i t i e s ere there f o r the
taking, f *
An essential a t t r i b u t e i n the
mature Individual i t h i s a b i l i t y to
be comfortable and' natural on a
formal occasion. This a b i l i t y l a
only aquirod through practice. Every
Tuesday the College holds a H a l l
Dinner i n Ayrton H a l l , Any student
may go along,(a booking must be made
in the Union O f f i c e ) , and dine with
members of the s t a f f on terms of
equality round the same table. The
some arguments apply to Formal
nances i by attendlngthose funotions
the most immature student w i l l soon
dispel h i s fears about being tongue-
t i e d and leaden-footed.
The a t h l e t i c prowess of t h i s
College i s legion i n the University.
In order to achieve t h i s p o s i t i o n
many students have indulged i n
Sport i n midweek. Not only does
t h i s midweek Sport enhance the rep-
utation of the College, but i t also
enables the i n d i v i d u a l to maintain
a reasonable l e v e l of f i t n e s s , Un-
fortunately, some departments make
i t d i f f i c u l t f o r students to have
Wednesday afternoons o f f , but that
does not prevent the more sensible
members from having t h e i r Sport,
It i s those students who remain
chained to t h e i r benches during
Wednesday afternoon who are to be
p i t i e d .
As w e l l as t a k i n g part i n some
a t h l e t i c endeavour, i t l a else a
good idea to be aasoolc'ed with
one of the Social Clubs. Tim l e t t e r
form a very useful t r a i n i n g ground
for after-College Uf«. t f one
wishes to become an expert M i l l
or chess player there ere the nec-
essary openings i n the Union.; The
Wine Tasting l o e i e t y w i l l develop
a novlee into e connoisseur, ets( >
f i n a l l y , the o f f i c i a l posts In «
Club always provide a goes t r a i n i n g
ground where one oan develop one's
q u a l i t i e s of leadership ana organ-
i s i n g a b i l i t y ,
I b e l i s v s that by following
the above points the freshmen w i l l
gain tho maximum rewards from h i s
stay hero, and w i l l be a p e r f e c t l y
f i t t e d i n d i v i d u a l to take up a
So s i t l o n of r e s p o n s i b i l i t y In the
c i o n t i f i o World.
