knowledgeable forboding; some just
with pure l u s t . A Carnival i s what
you make i t . You can enjoy yourselves
i n any mood. The Authorities prov-
ide the main theme: the rest i s up
to you. Last year Mines started the
b a l l r o l l i n g with an a l l night orgy
e n t i t l e d "BEER GARDENING". Judging
by the state of things the next
morning, beer wasn't the only thing
that was dug up.
The Cabaret (there i s always
a Cabaret, though most of the part-
i c i p a n t s are too drunk to care) was
a great success, being reminiscent
of the days when Kitchener was an
Undergraduate, and not Secretary
of the Union. Guild's came next,
a few weeks l a t e r , with "CAVEMEN
CAPERS". This was a c t u a l l y reported
i n the "Evening Standard" , who t o l d
a credulous public that a thousand
people were present, and that there
was also a fight with t r i f l e pudd-
ing. The l a t t e r was unfortunately
true; the former not. R.C.S. made'
up t h e i r c o l l e c t i v e minds not t o
have any rowdyism at t h e i r Carnival
"ALICE IN WONDERLAND". The h a l l i n
which i t was held was d e l i g h t f u l l y
decorated, and i f things were a
t r i f l e quiet, the true Carnival
s p i r i t was there (bottles of i t ) .
Many of you w i l l remember read-
ing about the demonstration by Lon^.
don students on November 5th 1953,
against the banning of an o f f i c i a l
rag. The Senate House, which cont-
r o l s London University, took s t r i c t
measures t o prevent any s i m i l a r
occurence i n the future, and the
Union Officers of I.C. organised a
counter a t t r a c t i o n at Harlington,
our Sports Ground i n Middlesex. I t
was f e l t at f i r s t by the majority
of students that such a venture would
end as a complete f a i l u r e , but t h i s
did not prove to be the case. Those
who went t o Harlington (and there
were many) enjoyed an evening which
attained Carnival standard™ Quite
apart from the l a v i s h display of
fireworks, there were hot dogs and
barbecued pig, dancing and a l l other
forms of entertainment usually i n -
dulged i n on such an evening. As
Left: Boanerges, the Guilds'
{residential ohariot , bought
back i n the mists of time and
a regular Brighton Runner.
Eight: Dennis , theft.& S.
presidential ohariot which
consumes big-ends faster than
fuel.
f a r as can be ascertained, only two
people went t o Hospital. Both r e -
covered.
Lest you should think that
College l i f e i s a l l beer and women,
l e t me mention some o f the more se-
rious e x t r a - c u r r i c u l a r a c t i v i t i e s .
The Dramatic Society has been hamp-
ered i n no small degree during the
past year by the loss of i t s stage.
Most kindly Q.E.C. came to the res-
cue with the o f f e r of t h e i r ' s . The
Dramatic Society began work immed-
i a t e l y on "The White Sheep of the
Family" which they successfully
produced i n December. Then again,
towards the end of the Spring Term,
they put on two one-act .plays:
"The Proposal" and-Anouilh's "Ant-
igone". These rather d i f f i c u l t ' p l a y s
were extremely w e l l produced and
acted. Keep i t up, Dramatic Society!
. You may be surprised to hear
that FELIX f u l f i l s several subsid-
i a r y duties, besides being the C o l l -
ege newspaper. Last year he ran a
Food Questionnaire which asked f o r
p a r t i c u l a r s regarding food stand-
ards, times of eating, places of
eating and so on. From the r e s u l t s ,
a f t e r they had been digestedby the
S t a t i s t i c i a n s , came f o r t h the sur-
p r i s i n g fact that some people at
t h i s College didn't eat at a l l . To
eat i n London may cost a l i t t l e at
the Savoy, but i t s cheap at Moonie's.
I s h a l l not quote r e s u l t s , as they
w i l l probably bore you; and anyway
they are out of date.
We have a newly formed Art Club
which held several exhibitions l a s t
year, of which one was a general
e x h i b i t i o n , and the rest by p a r t i c -
u l a r a r t i s t s . Being a s c i e n t i s t my-
s e l f , I am i n no p o s i t i o n to say
whether the standard was high; I
judge the paintings by the feelings
they arouse i n me. There were sev-
e r a l nude studies.
The Photographic Society's
Annual E x h i b i t i o n was of a very
high standard, although the entries
were fewer than they could have
been. Don't be put o f f by the work
of a nucleus of geniuses; you may
be one yourself, anyway.
If you've read t h i s f a r , you
must have noticed the abundance nf
superlatives l i k e "successful".
Most things t h i s College does are
successful. To a c e r t a i n extent i t
depends on the man at the top, but
without you and your support, they
could not do what they manage to do.
And some of you, l i k e Ponsonby o r
Preuveneers there, w i l l be w e l l on
the way to the top.
I.C. has the reputation of hav-
ing the finest, and being the finest,
in almost every field. And not o n l y
i n i t s College a c t i v i t i e s e i t h e r ;
which i s proved by the notable
g l i d e r record set up last May by
Frank G. Irving, of the Aeronautics
Department. Frank and Lorne Welch
were the f i r s t people t o cross the
Channel i n a two-seater g l i d e r -
while airborne.' More about this r e -
markable personality is to be found
elsewhere i n these pages.
The F i e l d Cup Race is s o l e l y
for Guildsmen. Every year the f i v e
Engineering Departments i n Guilds'
compete f o r a cup not much larger
than a hen's egg, presented by Mr.
F i e l d f o r the winners of t h i s t r u l y
remarkable race. I t i s run from the
College to the Serpentine (and often
i n i t ) ; the winners are the f i r s t
to cross t h i s stretch of water.(q.
e.d.) and there are no holds barred.
Last year's epic consisted of
conveying the four elements, each
in i t s own bucket, along the route.
After two minutes, the Entrance..
H a l l of Guilds' was inches deep i n
the elements. A t r a i l of t w i s t e d
buckets- and b l a z i n g p a r a f f i n t o l d
of t h e passage o f the b a t t e r e d
Guildsmen. To the Serpentine: n o
boats.' The boathouse keeper knew
us too w e l l . After twenty minutes
with Guildsmen throwing one-another
into the water, C i v i l Engineering
became the winners. Apparently j u s t
in time, f o r three large Policemen
flew down from Heaven on the crowd
chanting "Peace on Earth and good-
w i l l towards man" as they arrested
onlookers. When they had had t h e i r
f i l l , they flew away as quickly as
they had come.
