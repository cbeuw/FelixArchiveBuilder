I.G. M O U N T A I N E E R S
CLIMB ALPS
Early i n J u l y , one Sunday
morning, eight members of I.C.M.C.
party l e d by the r e t i r i n g president,
John Alexander, boarded a plane f o r
Switzerland. From Basle we went by
t r a i n and bus South to A r o l l a , which
i s a centre f o r some of the c l a s s i c
mountaineering country of the Valais,
This was the beginning of the club's
Alpine meet which lasted three weeks.
With our guide, who was engaged
for the f i r s t week, we climbed the
4500 feet to the Cabane de B e r t o l ,
one of the c l i n b i n g huts erected by
the Swiss Alpine Club f o r the use
of mountaineers. >Ve l i v e d i n t h i s
world of rock, snow and i c e f o r the
next eight days. On clear mornlncrs
the i s o l a t e d Dent Blanche and Matter-
horn towered proudly, c r i s p and
g l i s t e n i n g i n the c r y s t a l a i r . I n
that f i r s t week we followed i n the
steps of Maurice, our guide, who
gave us invaluable i n s t r u c t i o n and
took us on a v a r i e t y of rock and
snow climbs, the most e n t e r t a i n i n g
beine; the ascent of the Bouquetins.
Py the end we were quite s i c k of our
routine diet i n the hut,- food we
had laboriously carried up -and
i t was very pleasant to return to
the rrreen freshness of the v a l l e y .
Saying goodbye to our guide,
and one of the party who had a date
in Finland,the rest of us t r a v e l l e d
by t r a i n across to'-'ermatt, whioh
nestles under the famous 'latterhorn.

BY OUR CRICKET CORRESPONDENT
Readers of "FELIX", who also
take the "Manchester Guardian", may
have read already an account of the
Devon Tour, which began: "Among many
touring sides r e c e n t l y , one of the
most successful was Imperial College
who have Just returned from the
Mr. Whiteway of c i d e r fame,
I. C. scored 197-3 dec. i n 110
minutes, f i n i s h i n g with a hurricane
stand of 70 i n 23 minutes between
Hearn (30 n.o.) and Kitchener
(106 n.o. including 17 fours and
2 s i x e s ) . Walker (28) h i t the
famous oak tree which f l o u r i s h e s
30 yards from the wicket. Whimple
KITCH AND HIS MERRY MEN
West Country .... a feature of the
tour was the high scoring of the
College batsmen, who compiled 1,271
runs f o r the loss of only 41 wickets
at an average scoring rate of 92.7
an hour".
This amazing scoring began i n
the f i r s t match against the Royal
Navy Engineering College (Plymouth),
when I.C. scored 205-6 d e c , i n -
cluding an opening partnership of
73 by Fox (46) and Walker (35),
and a fine 57 not out by Shepherd.
Rain then made conditions very
d i f f i c u l t f o r our bowlers, but s i x
R. N. E. C. wickets were taken fee
188 before the close.
I.C. began disastrously against
the Royal Naval Barracks, losing
two wickets i n the f i r s t over. How-
ever they fought back to 72-5 by
lunch, a f t e r which a sparkling stand
of 44 i n 20 minutes between Weale
(15) and l.itchener (126) l a i d the
foundation f o r a declaration at
229-8, The Barracks batsmen were
never happy against Bhatti (5-28)
and were a l l out f o r 122.
I. C. were p a r t i c u l a r l y keen
to beat the Royal Marines, Lyran-
stone, as they had not done so f o r
many years. Thanks to a complete
rout by Dytham(3-8) and IIearn(4-12).
the Marines were put out f o r 55 and
I. C. won by s i x wickets,
Tn the t r a d i t i o n a l country
match at Whimple, who are led by
r e p l i e d s p i r i t e d l y and reached
167-4.
Some more riotous h i t t i n g at
Torquay l e d to an I.C. score of
252-7 dec i n ,iust over 2 hours
(Shepherd 80, Dacies 73, Hearn 35).
Unfortunately r a i n ended pro-
ceedings when Torquay had scored
4-0.
Ken i'.'eale (67 n.o. including
six sixes) and V/hiddon (52 i n 29
minutes) were the main contributors
to I.C.'s t o t a l of 180-4 dec. at
Brixham. Brixham played defensively
and could manage only 95-4 i n reply
(Cook 4-23).
Tn a f i n e match at Paignton,
I.C. began at a crawl and had
reached only 45-3 a f t e r an hours
play. At t h i s moment of c r i s e s '
Davies (42) and Kitchener (44)
added 65 i n 38 minutes, and the
I.C. t o t a l of 152 was too many f o r
Paignton, who were dismissed f o r
106 a f t e r t h e i r opening p a i r had
put on 82.
In the evenings the t o u r i s t s
relaxed t h e i r weary limbs and
restored t h e i r strength, either
in the dingy pubs of Plymouth
dockland or the old timbered
hostelcies of lixeter. Even Gordon
Green would have admired the high
standard of Sport, which culininati
in a c o r d i a l exchange of views with
representatives of the United
States Navy (Most of which was
anchored i n Torbay"1
and the Devon-
shire Constabulary.
