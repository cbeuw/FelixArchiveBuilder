PEWS U IBRIEF
The presidental Dinner and Da-
nce was heldat the Rembrandt Hotel.
Among the speeches a f t e r dinner was
A. V. S. de Reticle's reminder that
"clangers are d e f i n i t e l y out". Dan-
cing, both inside and outside, went
on t i l l the early morning hours,
when one poor t a x i - d r i v e r ' s cab be-
came a p u b l i c thoroughfare. A l l i n
a l l , i t was a most enjoyable evening,

Maidstone C i v i c Theatre saw the
I.C. Dramatic Society's production
of "Someone Waiting" by Emlyn
Williams,during t h i s Summer vacation.
As Cheltenham has been the usual
stage f o r the Tour i n previous years
the Society was on v i r g i n t e r r i t o r y
in Maidstone. Although the venture
was not a f i n a n c i a l success, the
impression they created was worthy
of t h i s energetic Society.

RIGHTt THE RODERIC HILL BUILDING;
(from the drawing by F.Weemjpe)
BY JOHN SCOTT SEELEY
For the l a s t year the peaceful
calm of Imperial College has been
shattered by the roar of the a i r -
compreesor and the chatter of the
pneumatic d r i l l . The b u i l d e r s are
i n , and they w i l l be staying with us
for several more years. Between the
years 1953 and 1962 the student pop-
u l a t i o n of t h i s College w i l l be ex-
panded from 1500 to over 3000. To acc-
omodate the extra numbers the College
and Union Buildings w i l l be added
to, and i n some cases, modified.
It is a vast p r o j e c t , involving the
expenditure of £15 m i l l i o n s of pub-
l i c funds.
During the past eighteen months
four preliminary projects have been
put i n hand. One has been completed:
9 fourth storey having been added to
the R.S.M. and Goldsmiths' extension
of Guilds. The architects were i.'or-
man and Dawbarn. The Union Building
(N. side of the Beit Building, close
to the Albert H a l l ) i s being convert-
ed from a two-storey b u i l d i n g of
25,000 sq. f t . to a four-storey
b u i l d i n g of 50,000 sq. f t . Work
began i n July '54 and i s due to be
completed i n J u l y *56. A permanent
refectory isalready i n s t a l l e d i n the
ground f l o o r of t h i s b u i l d i n g . The
a r c h i t e c t s are S u t c l i f f and Partners
with S i r Hubert Worthington as con-
s u l t a n t .
By f a r the largest of the pres-
ent projects i s the Roderic H i l l
Building on. the South side of
Prince Consort Rd., next to the Royal
College of Music. The f i n i s h e d front
of t h i s b u i l b i n g i s shown i n our
i l l u s t r a t i o n , from the drawing by Mr.
Frank Weemys. This new b u i l d i n g w i l l
give a nett increase of 81,000 s q . f t .
to house the expanded departments of
Chemical Engineering and Aeronautics.
Aeronautics i s due by October '56
and Chemical Engineering by January
'57. The architects are again Norm-
man and Dawbarn with S i r Hubert Wor-
thington, as consultant.
The large s i n g l e - f l o o r Bessemer
Lab. i n the R.S,M. i s beingconverted
to a three-storey building f o r use
as engineering workshops and mater-
i a l s laboratories, giving 10,000 sq.
f t . of additional space. Building
began i n January ' 85 and i s scheduled
for completion f o r the beginning of
t h i s session. The architects are
Norman and Dawbarn.
For the future, plans of most
interest to FELIX readers w i l l be
those applying to Union Buildings.
As a Remembrance to S i r Roderic H i l l
the Beit Quadrangle w i l l be l a i d out
as a semi-formal garden with grass
lawns and York stone paths, and some
central feature which may
be a fountain. The tennis club have
recieved extra courts at Harlington
as compensation f o r the loss of i t s
old courts on t h i s s i t e . I.C. stu-
dents w i l l welcome the proposal that,
at long l a s t , the Hostel accommdda-
t i o n i s to be increased. At present
t h i s has not been made d e f i n i t e , but
we can hope f o r room f o r additional
100 students.
On the wider plane l e g a l d i f -
f i c u l t i e s have a r i s e n i n c l e a r i n g ths
Imperial I n s t i t u t e Rd. / Prince con-
sort Rd. s i t e f o r the complete de-
velopment of the College. This i s
a Government a f f a i r . In the debate
on S c i e n t i f i c and Technical Manpower
in the House of Commons on J u l y 21st,
Mr. Brooke (Financial Secretary to
the Treasury)stated that; " i n order
to overcome these l e g a l d i f f i c u l t i e s
i t may be necessary f o r the Govern-
ment to introduce enabling l e g i s l a -
t i o n a f t e r the Recess"'..
Comment
It can be j u s t i f i a b l y stated
that the progress of the Contractors
on the Union Building seems to be
very slow. Their job Has been d i f -
f i c u l t i n that they started with
h a l f - a - b u i l d i n g and have had very
l i t t l e room to manouevre to b u i l d
upwards. But as a team they seem
i n f e r i o r to those across the road
working on the new Aeronautics and
Chemical Engineering Building.
Let us hope there i s no i n f e r i o r
work put i n to complete the contract
by July '56.
The tentative proposals, at
present under discussion, f o r the ex-
pansion of the Hostel, are that the
whole of the Beit and Union Buildings
w i l l be given over to Union a c t i v -
i t i e s and student r e s i d e n t i a l acc-
omodation. General student f e e l i n g
has been of t h i s opinion f o r years
past.. I f t h i s college i s to continue
to provide U n i v e r s i t y - l e v e l educa-
t i o n , i t s r e s i d e n t i a l accomodation
must be increased at least four-fold.
The dreadful alternative i s that
I. C. might become a Technical
I n s t i t u t i o n with only i t s academic
reputation l e f t . It i s the duty of
a l l to ensure that t h i s never
happens.
