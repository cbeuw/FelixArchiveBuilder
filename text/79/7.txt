The ( u n o f f i c i a l ) B r i t i s h
National, and European height
records f o r g l i d e r t r a i l e r s now
stands at 8600 f e e t . These were
captured by the Imperial College
G l i d i n g Club w h i l s t on the Gross-
glockner Pass i n A u s t r i a a f t e r twice
beating i t s own e x i s t i n g records
over the J u l i e r and Bernina Passes.
It i s regrettable t o record that
these were also the greatest heights
attained by the g l i d e r , on or above
ground, w h i l s t on the continent (but
see page 8. column 1)
The party of 8 men, and one
g i r l l e f t on the 4th. August i n
three cars, one towing the e l i d e r
and t r a i l e r . The night of the 5th.
was spent at the g l i d i n g s i t e of
Pont-St-Vincent near Nancy. A f t e r
supper each member was "interrogated"
in French ("Name, Age, Number of
prangs, etc. ) with F.G.I, acting as
i n t e * -eter when needed.
questioner: Quel est votre role
dans cette e'quipe,
Ma'araselle?
F.G.I.: (Hurriedly) E l l e
est experte, a
f a i r e l e cafe.
The next g l i d i n g s i t e v i s i t e d
was Saraedan , near St. Moritz, where
two days were spent f e t t l i n g motor
cars . Unfortunately the weather was
unkind and l i t t l e f l y i n g was done
w h i l s t the party was there. The aero-
drome was situated at 6000 feet
»bove sea l e v e l , and i t was extremely
l a s t year. Some f l y i n g was also done
in ancient Russian designed biplanes
"PO-2s" and i n a "Brucker Jungmann':
On the l a s t day F.G.I, gave an
impressive e x h i b i t i o n of g l i d e r
aerobatics at a l o c a l a i r display.
At the beginning of the homewo-d
journey, the road from Belgrade t o
Zagreb (250 miles) was covered by
the t r a i l e r at an average speed of
47.5 m.p.h. and a F l y i n g Kilometre
at 62.4 m.p.h.
A couple of days were spent at
Zell-am-See i n A u s t r i a , where the
Skylark and two types of Austrian
g l i d e r were flown from a g l i d i n g
s i t e amongst the mountains, and close
to the lake.
In a l l about 3350 miles were
Covered. The Vanguard and t r a i l e r
had one puncture, Ian Duff's Morris
broke a spring, and Mike Neale's
Morris wore out two front wheel
bearings, two b i g ends and one
sump I
The remnants of the party a r r i -
ved back at Dover between four and
six weeks a f t e r leaving England.
None of them w i l l ever forget the
h o s p i t a l i t y and genuine f r i e n d -
l i n e s s of the Yugoslavs.

chillsome. However the b e a u t i f u l
mountain scenery compensated f o r a
l i t t l e of the discomfort.
Two nights were spent i n I t a l y ,
the f i r s t by a lake (F.G.I, and Miss
Lanca^'er were persuaded to swim i n
the morning- ( f u l l y clothed f o r
decency's sake!) and the other out-
side Venice.
The G l i d i n g Centre at VrSac i n
Yugoslavia was reached three days
l a t e r . In the l a s t day 300 miles were
covered. The f i r s t 250 miles were
along almost the best, and c e r t a i n l y
the least used main road i n Europe
-the Yugoslav l o r r y drivers have a
l i t t l e game which involves climbing
under the engine, and h i t t i n g i t
with a Gi'normous persuader! (heavy
hammer t o the none-gliding types).
The l a s t 50 miles were c e r t a i n l y the
worst roads encountered.
The Centre was p a l a t i a l , but
set amongst countryside of the
utmost poverty, f o r Yugoslavia i s a
country of extremes. Here the party
sojourned f o r ten days. Owing t o
poor soaring weather the Skylark was
only flown f o r about 8 hours, but
the v i s i t o r s had the consolation of
f l y i n g many d i f f e r e n t , and
i n t e r e s t i n g Yugoslav gliders
including"Orao" and "Kosava", both
of which were usedbythe Yugoslavs
at the World Championships i n England
