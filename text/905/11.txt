Okay, so we've all got exams this
term. For some they're the last ones that
they'll ever take at this wonderful little
college of ours. For some they are just
the beginning, and all the fun and
splendour of finals are a mere glimmer
on the horizon two or three years hence.
But the main point is: For some they are
already over, and for some they are still
a fair way off, and Felix needs more
input!
Even at the best of times it can be a bit
of an uphill struggle to get enough
material together to produce a decent
issue. In a college of over 6000 students
we continually seem to have to rely on
about a dozen regular people for most of
our stuff. This really sucks. I know about
the exams: Unlike a normal Felix editor
I'm a non-sabbatical, and I've got exams
this term as well. But no one has them
non stop for the whole term, and a lot of
you guys and gals have finished now.
Everybody finds it easy to tell me that
Felix hasn't seemed to have much in it
this term. Why don't some of you try and
see how easy it is to give us a hand?
A n d while we're on the subject...
Why on earth does IC (along with most
other universities, etc) still use the most
archaic exam system ever? Someday
someone will explain this to me. Or at
least I hope so, because I can't work it
out.
All that the current style of exams
really test is the ability of a student to
memorise an often huge amount of
information, and churn it out in a vaguely
readable form. That, and the speed of
their handwriting, and their ability to deal
with short term stress. It's ridiculous. The
relationship between a students actual
ability at the subject and their exam
mark is minimised. As is the relationship
between a students ability to work
consistently and usefully. I have several
friends who have done virtually no work
for an entire year, spend about two
weeks revising like mad and doing all the
past papers three times, and then end up
with 70-90% marks!
I'm not trying to say that they should
fail, but surely there are two main uses
for a degree: To gain a higher level job
in a business unrelated to the subject, or
to gain some form of employment
involved with the subject studied.
In the first case the degree should
represent the ability of the graduate to
work consistently with a high level of
personal motivation and independence;
adapt to different or new situations and
produce results to deadlines, etc.
In the second case the degree should
represent all of theabove, and show that
the graduate actually has a good
understanding of the subject and it's basic
concepts, as well as representing a high
level of ability in it.
Let's face it: The majority of our
degrees are gained by our exam marks,
and the type of exams we have don't
really represent any of the above very
well (if at all). Consequently, people who
have a high ability in the subject, and
work hard all the. time, but aren't good at
exams (for whatever reason) don't
achieve the degree that they should. In
most of the exams I've taken, someone
with no knowledge or understanding of
Biology, and a photographic memory,
could at least have passed, and might
have done very well!
It's about time this was changed. Just
having a high level of education in a
subject is useless if the means by which
the subject is tested don't actually
measure what they should.
The majority, if not all, of exams should
be 'open book', so you can take your
notes and/or textbooks in with you: The
ability to organise personal material, and
quickly find information when necessary
is a very important skill, and becoming
more important all the time. Also, 'open
book' exams judge your ability to, for
example, use a formula correctly, not
your ability to remember it in the first
place. Which do you think gives a better
representation of your understanding of a
subject?
It has been stated in various studies on
examinations that multiple-choice papers
give a far better portrayal of a students
ability than traditional written papers. But
how many university exams have
multiple-choice papers? Why not ??!!
They're even easy to mark!
In addition to the exams themselves,
there should be a greater amount of in-
course assessment, instead of the odd
practical, essay, or problem sheet, and
this should be give more weighting in the
final marking. Not only would this
increase the importance placed on
consistent work, but it would also
encourage interaction between students
and academic staff, as more students
would seek the help of their lecturers
with the work.
But then, I'm sure there's a very good
reason why I'm wrong. It's just that I
can't find anybody to explain it to me.
Good luck in the exams, everybody.
Maybe someday they'll actually reflect the
reasons why we're here.
