Guarding our
lunch-box with
our lives,
FELIX went to
interview the
non-stop eatinf
'n9
rockin'
machine that is
Tad on the
road. Tales
from the lard
side: Seb.

If Tad were physically capable of
bumping and grinding he would. It is not
a figment of your imagination that the
new albums's name 8 Way Santa sounds
like some yuletide perversion. Tad is
perverse, the music and image all ooze a
perverse, toxic vomit inducing, smegma
of slime. And Tad, in the flesh, lives up
to all expectations. He is fairly quiet. He
claims the image is just how he happens
to dress. Anyway, I would advise
feminists or the faint hearted to cease
reading now because...
Tad is an Irish butcher, or a half-irish
ex-butcher who threw down the cleaver
for a guitar 'cause the attraction of
'holdin a knife and stabbin a big slab of
meat repeatedly while the violins go
whee whee...high scrill violins' wasn't so
great. Now, the Tad rock 'n' roll
experience tours six months of every
year with the rest spent 'completely out
of our minds on drugs and fucking girls
constantly...constantly'.
I was lucky (or unfortunate) enough to
catch up with the Tad crew at their
promo gig at the Powerhaus and created
an audience with the great gods balls of
Tad and Kurt themselves.
So why did you decide to base your
music on aboriginal folklore?
Kurt: It seemed like a natural thing to do.
Something some people were hinting at
but nobody was doing it to the extent we
wanted to do it...rock 'n' roll is a really
cool medium to work in and there's lots
of room for developing interesting
characters and having interesting
narratives developing through the records
and not many people take advantage of
it. It's something we can do.
Tad: It's true.
Some of the songs seem to be based
on fact?
Tad: Some are, some aren't. We mix fact
and fiction and make it better...or worse.
So some times the real T a d comes out
in songs?
Kurt: The real Tad is a private secret
Tad.
Tad: The real Tad is someone you can
only get to know if you marry him, sleep
with him, eat vegetables with himâ€”raw
hard vegetables. I love vegetables. I love
meat.
A n d a general discussion of the
merits of eating raw carrots follows.
After all isn't life as a rock star all
about such eccentricities?
Tad: We're getting a whole lot more out
of life.
Kurt: Everything that's good in life is
