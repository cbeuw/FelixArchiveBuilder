better and everything that's bad is...
Chorus: Worse.
Tad: Business.
Kurt: Love.
How is love?
Tad: Love is bad. Good lovin has
gone...straight to hell in a hand basket. A
hand basket carried by a veneral
syphalitic cunt.
So you get depressed?
Kurt: We get very depressed sometimes,
we want to slit our wrists and leave
incriminating suicide notes detailing all
sorts of slanderous events and incidents.
Ever tried suicide?
Kurt: Many times, usually with sleeping
pills, usually get rushed to the hospital at
the last minute, like Bjorn Borg. Actually
we hang out with Bjorn a lot.
Tad: I filled a pillowcase with a couple of
cans of Seven Up and tried to beat myself
around the head till I was dead but it
didn't work.
Kurt: I filled a tube sock with a couple of
oranges... We don't seem too successful at
it.
Tad: Only in bed.
Kurt: We're living a healthy life with
plenty of orange juice...
You're rough in bed?
Tad: You betcha.
Kurt: Nasty.
Tad: Overwhelming. There aint a girl
alive who can't say she's shagged and
knackered once we're done with her.
General discussion of bollocks,
bullocks, steers and general bovine
matters. So, Tad, what did you hack
at?
Tad: We cut up heffers mostly. Females
with yawning gashes, big spitty type
pooches...
Kurt: Pooches poochy pouches...
Tad: It was like squeezing together two
leather flaps and watching the cream
come out, cream curded cheeses...
A woman walks into the bar and
general letching follows...
Tad: They're not women, they're mutants
acting like women.
Why?
Tad: You tell me.
Kurt: Mutilated and sewn back together
by aliens.
Tad: Hatched in pods from under the
Tyne river.
Kurt: New gash on Tyne—the city of
gash. There's nothing wrong with
Newcastle 'cept the water's a strange
colour.
So what's the most beautiful thing you
ever saw?
Kurt: Twat...
Tad: The most beautiful thing...'
Kurt: Yawning gash...
Tad: ...I don't think I've seen it.
A n d what about gigs, you like
stagediving? (There were invariably
more members of the audience on the
stage than band members.)
Tad: It should be required (Tad himself is
an impressive veteran stagediver).
What about the photos? (Tad takes
instamatics of the audience)
Tad: I draw satanic messages on them
and jerk off over them. Light sparklers
and spill blood on them...go out and kill
horses with razor blades, cut their veins
draw the blood into big buckets and paint
the photographs...
Kurt: With our dicks.
Tad...with warm horses blood—using our
dicks as paint brushes, using our dicks
and swabs.
Y o u r secret perversion?
Tad: Women...
Kurt: ...Chappie dog food...
Tad: Chappie dog food spread all over
cock-like nipples and licked until they're
knackered, they're screaming raw.
Besides unlimited verbal perversions
Tad plan on 'writing and releasing
records' in the future.
Last words for the great British
student public?
Tad: Drop out, take acid and don't pay
no Poll Tax.
Kurt: And keep those meat curtains
drawn.
Cyberaktif
—Tenebrae Vision LP
This album sounds very good on a
walkman turned up loud as you strut
down the street on a warm, but rainy,
night in, say, April. You have just been
somewhere, where exacty is unimportant,
and are returning home suitably loaded
to the gills on a substance cocktail. There
is a menacing feeling in the air and
you're feeling tough with the hard
electro-dark techno rhythms pulsing in
your ears. They provide a more than
adequate soundtrack to your own
miniview of the world. The rain, the
speckled lights and the darkness move to
form a Bladerunner-like setting. The
vocals are phased just the wrong side of
intelligible and combine with eerie breaks
and estranged samples, including one
which sounds like someone gargling in
slow-motion as they drown, to make you
feel uneasy and start walking faster.
Just when you needed it least, you
have an acid flashback and panic. The
music is now driving you further and
further towards the edge; the relentless
march of techno, gunshot samples—are
they real?—ring out and the dark clammy
feeling extends through the headphones
into your soul. You're really losing
yourself now, especially when the Devil-
worshipping sample pops out of the blue.
At times the vocals sound like those of a
man having his soul sucked out. Y'know,
you see it in the films all the time.
Eventually the terror stops as the tape
ends and you return home to chill out
with the MC5. Pretty good night out.
Dominic.
Milltown
Brothers
-ULU 10.5.91
Call me protective, pretentious and
pompous but any group that draws a
crowd that's on average six inches
shorter and three years younger than me
I'm out of there. The 'sixteen years old,
seen them on the TOTP, fancy the* lead
singer' scene is not for me. The hall
looked more like a Milltown Brothers
appreciation society meeting than a gig. If
I was disappointed it didn't last for long.
Excellent support came first from
Beware of the Green Monkey. The lead
singer did a brilliant impression of a
spider on speed, arms and legs flying
around in an ungamely dance. With a
little more creativity and continued
enthusiasm they could be good. Then,
1000 Yard Stare. The lead singer seeming
rather perplexed at the frantic response
they generated, apologetically thanking
the crowd for their efforts. Great
energetic music that bodes well for their
future.
When the Milltown Brothers took the
stage you could tell that things had only
just begun. Concentrating on material
from Slinky with a few older and a
couple of new numbers mixed in their
fifty minute set drained the crowd to
exhaustion.
If anyone had come expecting the same
sort of limp performance they gave
supporting The La's they were crushed in
the rush. This was a case of a band firing
on all cylinders with the turbo charger up
full. Even Matt had to take a breather,
squatting on the stage while the others
continued the show.
Lifted by the crowd they returned for
on encore and a second performance of
'Which way should I jump' rounding off a
brilliant show.
My faith restored I left happy in the
knowledge that their audience may have
changed but the Milltown Brothers still
have what it takes to entertain.

Xymox
—Phoenix of My Heart 12"
Xymox sounds like a new drug. Think
about it. Good name for a drug doncha
think? Let's see if it sounds like one.
Randomly aural bleep intersections
abound. Gregorian chants. Medium tempo
dance number. Synthoid scuzz metal
geetar (lose one brownie point). Nice
cover (looks a bit like a new drug). Goes
on a bit. Song ends. Another version
starts up. Less blips. I start to lose
interest. I liked the blips. End of record.
Well, it didn't sound much like a new
drug. Hmmmph. Let's see if it tastes like
one...
Dominic.
