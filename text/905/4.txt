Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead
I From the mind of Tom Stoppard,
writer of 'The Real Inspector
Hound' and screenplay scripter,
comes a bag of fervent ideas to amuse
and tease. This play, first shown at the
Old Vic in 1967, displays all his wit and
intellect, and brought him many an
award in Britain and America.
Based on and around Hamlet, the film
follows the forced adventures of two of
his servants, Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern, summoned by Royal
Command to the court of Denmark.
Hamlet's father has been killed by his
brother, who jumped quickly onto the
throne and into marriage with the Queen.
It appears that this has addled Hamlet's
brain and is causing great concern to the
Royal Court. Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are brought in to look into
his problems and find a solution.
Tim Roth and Gary Oldman make an
exquisite duo as the servants who are
always verbally sparring and playing
games with each other. Beautiful ideas
are brought forth way ahead of their
historical time in a way that seems so
wonderfully obvious. The discovery of
steam turbines, paper aircraft and
executive toys makes one think; why did
it take so long to reveal their practical
significance?
Though set perfectly as a costume
drama, the opening bluesy guitar riffs and
the first scenes remind you of a classic
western. Tales told within tales by The
Player (Richard Dreyfuss) make a
mockery of the servants' view of life and
Prayer of the Rollerboys
This may well be the best Sci-Fi
• rollerskate action movie of the
year, but only just. It tells of how
after America has crumbled under the
debts left by credit frenzy (overdraft city)
a group of adolescent fascist drug dealers
(on rollerskates) try to rebuild the great
US. The cops want to stop these narcotic
tradesmen/boys and to this end intend
getting Griffin (Corey Haim, the one from
the Lost Boys) to infiltrate. Add the pretty
young love interest in the shapely shape
of Casey (Patricia Arquette, the one from
Nightmare on Elm Street Three), a little
brother (in the shape of a gnome on acid)
Miltie (Devin Clark, the one from bugger
all) and an inevitable childhood friendship
between Griffin and Gary Lee
(Christopher Collet, the main baddy from
Prayer of the Rollerboys).
Of course, the Rollerboys, who
resemble the Brady Bunch on bad acid,
wind up getting involved with Griffin's
life. In order to save the old folks home
which he loves Griffin and Casey have to
form a roller disco championship team
and win the prize money.
That's not what happens but it would
have been a better movie. Okay, it
wouldn't, but close. What does happen is
that the appallingly bandanna'ed Griffin
(think Axl Rose with less (!) taste)
infiltrates the Rollerboys despite his
complete lack of acting ability and takes
them out from the inside. Joining the
Rollerboys (apart from its fascist and
drugfrenzy problem) could well be the
best thing Griffin does all movie; they
take away his bandanna and shoot it,
give him some cool shades and give him
a reason to get off with Casey.
All this said and buried, it's not as bad
as it sounds. It is bad, but not as bad as it
sounds. Most of the acting is dreadful and
the rollerskates are practically subliminal
(more of a tribute to Leo Sayer) but there
is definitely a masochistic charm that
keeps you watching (Oh to be thirteen
and tasteless). It beats washing tramps.
The Amazing Flying Gerbil Machine
The Flying Gerbil would like to make it
clear that he dissociates himself from the
final two lines of this .review. Vagabonds
to the Felix office please.
provide more intrigue than Tinker, Tailor,
Soldier, Spy. Bouncing from balcony
scene to balcony scene reduces Romeo
and Juliette to a french farce.
In short it is a film not to be missed at
any cost, a cinematic creation far too
long in the coming that shouldn't be
allowed to fade away. And just remember
'Death is for Kings, Princes, and
nobodies.'.
