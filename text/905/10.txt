FELIX
Video Competition
Deadline —
Tuesday lunchtime
Warner Bros have recently released two
of their successes, Dead Calm and Clara's
Heart, on video. In Dead Calm, John
Ingram and his wife take a pleasure
cruise in the Great Barrier Reef and sail
into terrifying danger.
Rescuing a sailor from a drifting boat
were the crew purportedly died from
food poisoning, they find that they have
taken on board a psychotic Vietnam
veteran who hacked his shipmates to
pieces in a frenzied range.
Clara's Heart sees Whoopi Goldberg as
a witty, warm and wise Jamaican
housemaid to whom David Heart turns
when faced with his parents impending
divorce. They become unlikely friends,
despite their dramatically different
backgrounds, because Clara's Heart was
once broken too. Now she can help David
over his pain and heal her own deep
hurt.
Felix has three sets videos to be won.
Just answer these two simple questions:
1. In which film did Whoopi
Goldberg play a computer operator
who finds herself drawn into the
world of espionage?
2. George Miller produced Dead
Calm. He also directed a cult futuristic
road movie. What was it?
Write your name and answers on a
piece of paper and bring it to the Felix
office (on the ground floor of the Union
building) by Tuesday lunchtime.
