After submitting my report to Felix last
week, I received a note from Mr Peter
Mee, College Registrar, concerning the
future of the Careers Service.
Mr Mee assures me that 'it has never
been the intention that individual students
would have to pay for services as a result
of the changed arrangements.'
One other point raised in my report
was also answeredâ€”that of possibly
usingan assessment centre to recruit the
new Director of the Careers Service.
Unfortunately, this will not be happening,
and a more conventional approach to
appointing the Director will be taken.
