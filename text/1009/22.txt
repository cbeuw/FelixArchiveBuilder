IC Women lstvs QMW
IC made a positive start,
pulling ahead in the first
quarter. The defence worked
hard to gain many
interceptions which, helped
by a forceful attack, were
converted into goals.
There was some
dangerous play in the final
quarter, which the umpire
failed to pick up. However,
despite the frustration (and
some sore knees) IC held on
and won.
IC1 st vs St Georges 1st
Despite the appalling weather
conditions on Saturday,
causing a dangerous court
that was up to 5cm under
water, we made a strong start.
It soon became obvious that if
we could stop the ball from
reaching their 6 feet tall goal
shooter the game was ours.
As the cold and the wet
conditions began to take their
toll we relaxed a little, but it
was still a convincing victory
with many acrobatic displays
in the puddles.
Thanks to everyone who
braved the weather and the
courts to play. Thanks also to
Matt who lent moral support
and encouragement.

IC Team vs Cardiff University
Saturday was a let down, due
to constant rain which
flooded the courts. We had
far from our best performance
of the year, and we finished
Saturday night with a deficit.
However Sunday morning
was much better, by lunch
time we had reduced Cardiffs
lead, and the match result
rested on the final singles of
the day. Paul Cook took the
singles to squeeze a satisfying
8-7 victory for I.C.
Thanks to all players of
the team. Everyone put in
100% effort, and there was a
superb team spirit, which
bodes well for the future.

Annual National Competition at City
University
The IC team passed the first
round without fighting,
having received a 'by' in the
draw. This put them up
against the Shenley team,
who had fought well in the
first round. A close round of
five fights ensued, with IC
defeating Shenley. Keith
sustained an injury in his
fight, and so was replaced by
Alex. A fortuitous draw gave
IC another 'by', thus placing
them against Harlston B in
the final.
The two teams showed
themselves to be very evenly
matched. Yasuda and Alex
suffered defeats in the first
two rounds, and the third
fight was won by Marcus.
Dave's fight proved to be the
decider, with three referees
signalling a draw. Eventually
another judges' decision gave
the victory to Harlston.
So after an eventful days
fighting IC left with second
place and a silver trophy. Our
thanks must go to Capt. Dave
Lloyd for his sterling effort
and to Sifus Lai and
Guishard for their invaluable
instruction.

ICWAFCvsUCL
It was an average game until
we conceded a penalty. Helen
managed to deflect the first
shot, but UCL collected the
ball and scored. Maryam then
decided to take up keeping
for the first time, as a captain
should ! ? However, she gave
away a free kick forgetting
she held the ball as she took
five steps. The defence fell
into place, but another goal
was unavoidable.
Ifanyone out there
thinks they can contribute,
read the football notice board
and get involved.

IC ladies vs St Georges
IC 2nd were defeated by st
Georges lst in the Cup. The
score did not reflect the
standard of play and Sarah
Deacon gave a brilliant
performance despite arriving
late. Congratulations to
Annaly on her first goal for
IC (that's a jug!).
Thanks to Helen Randall
for keeping a clean sheet on
her guest appearance in goal.
IC ladies vs QMW
A fast game with many
dubious decisions lead to IC
lst being defeated by QMW.
A good cross by Sarah
resulted in Karen blasting the
ball into the goal and pulling
a muscle, but back at QMW
she had an offer of a massage
from security.
Melanie was for once in
the right place and stopped
QMW from scoring with a
reverse stick stop on the line
-much to the relief of Emily.
Rugby 0 S
IC 2nd XV vs QMW
We started strongly and
reached half time 3-0 up,
though it should have been
more. QMW struck back with
a try followed by a penalty. A
try courtesy of Jamil levelled
the scores and we went very
close to talking the lead with
a long range penalty
Neither team could
snatch the victory we deserved
due to some excellent play by
the forwards.
IC lstvs QMW
Straight from the kick-off the
pack powered their way down
the field. The IC forwards
dominated the line-outs,
through superb jumping by
Jim Ryan. Tries were scored
by Tim Townend and
Richard Stubbs.
IC now need to
consolidate their position in
the group by securing a win
against Royal Holloway next
week - watch this space!
