IC Caterers Walk Out On Miners
BY ANDREW SINHARAY
College caterers walked out on
150 diners attending the RSMU
Freshers' dinner last Friday.
The £17 a head dinner,
subsidised by R S M depart-
ments, was intended to welcome
freshers to the RSM. It was
attended by dignitaries such as
the Professor Tim Shaw, Dean
of the RSM, and Professor Mike
Worthington, Head of Geology.
The miners, coming from
pre-dinner drinks at the Union
Bar, had been looking forward
to a pleasant evening in
Sherfield's Senior Common
Room.
However, as the evening
progressed, many of those
attending became slightly
drunk. Observers have
described scenes of intoxication,
students vomiting and throwing
food, and widespread spiking of
drinks.
After one person vomited,
Mr Vinod Fernandez, RSMU
President, was told by one of
the catering staff that should
things worsen, Catering would
stop the dinner. Later, whilst
the diners were enjoying
dessert, the catering section was
shut down and locked up. When
bemused miners queried the
action, Mr Fernandez was told
to take any complaints to a
higher authority.
Speaking to F E L I X , Simon
Westerman, IC Catering
Manager, said that it is required
of all licensees that they do not
serve intoxicated customers.
"My staff feared for their own
safety in view of the level of
drunkenness and they are not
prepared to honour any future
RSM bookings ... they are
employed as caterers, not vomit
cleaners."
However, M r Fernandez
denied any reprehensible behav-
iour on the part of the miners.
"We've always had dinners
in Sherfield, and this was far
tamer than in previous years.
They knew what they were let-
ting themselves in for. We made
sure that it was quieter [than in
previous years] and my Vice-
President, Hon Sec and myself
stayed behind for an hour clear-
ing up the mess which was over
and above a reasonable amount."
At last year's dinner, a fresh-
er got so drunk he had to be car-
ried home by friends, and he
later fell out of a third floor win-
dow ( F E L I X 977).
Fundamental
Differences

Muslim extremists have once
again caught the attention of the
London student arena.
In recent weeks a group
called Hizb u Tahrir were
reported to have been
distributing leaflets of an anti-
homosexual and anti-Semitic
nature in and around the
University of London Union
(ULU) premises. An incident
also occurred at the Kings
College freshers' fair, where a
group was asked to leave
following the identification of
one of its members as a Hizb u
Tahrir activist. The group left
peacefully.
Last Wednesday evening the
U L U Council passed a motion
re-enforcing its "stance against
bigotry and prejudice from any
source".
The resolutions passed at the
GUC meeting state that: GUC
refuses to allow distribution of
literature which breaks the U L U
constitution (which can be
inferred from the constitution
itself). Furthermore, G U C
