News In Brief

A major refurbishment has been
completed on part of the top floor
of the Sherfield building.
'Suite 5', which has locked
doors at the end of each corridor,
includes offices for all the senior
management. Despite its
somewhat prison-like exterior,
Sir Ronald Oxburgh, the Rector,
has said that he is delighted with
the results.
Sir Ronald said that 40%
more office space has been gained
with the inclusion of the corridor
in an open plan arrangement.
Fundamental Differences
(continuedfrom page 1)
refuses to allow Hizb u Tahrir,
or any other group or individual,
to promote any views
contravening the U L U
constitution; the latter applies to
any group, or individual, acting
as a front to such a group as well.
Sources in U L U stressed to
F E L I X that this motion was not
directed at any general group,
but rather at particular
extremists, such as Hizb u
Tahrir, who actively promote
bigoted and racist ideas through
the distribution of such
literature.
Hizb u Tahrir — Arabic for
'Liberation Party' — was one of
the groups instrumental in
organising the Muslim Khilafah
conference in Wembley Arena
this summer. The aim of the
conference was 'to assist in the
work to unify the global Muslim
community'.
Omar Bakri, the national
organiser of the Hizb u Tahrir,
in an interview with 'The
Independent' claimed that he has
assembled some 2000 members
nationwide, and taken control of
Islamic societies in
approximately 50 British
Universities.
Hiba Abdul-Hameed, a
member of IC Islamic Society,
was present at the conference
this summer. "At the end of the
conference Hizb u Tahrir stated
that they are not anti-Semitic or
homophobic", she told F E L I X .
"They are often quoted out of
context."

Ian Caldwell, Director of Estates,
has admitted that architects will
be reporting in early November,
with a view to a gradual
transformation of the whole of
Sherfield.
While Mr Caldwell declined
to put a figure on the cost of the
renovations, he pointed to the
better working environment,
flexible spacing of offices, and
lower running costs as a
justification.
A much smaller
refurbishment of the Huxley
Building foyer last year cost
£60,000 ( F E L I X 1001).

Labour To Back Loans?
The Labour Party's Commission
on Social Justice, reporting this
week, is said to have
recommended that student
funding be based solely upon a
loans system.
However, the party has
stressed that the Commission's
report does not constitute party
policy, and will be used solely as a
basis for future discussion on
policy.
Light My Fire
Complaints have been rife over
fire precautions in the
Department of Computing after a
fire drill last Thursday morning.
The fire alarms in the
Huxley Building were triggered
at approximately 11:45am, and it
is said that it took around
fourteen minutes for the building
to be evacuated. Security have
pointed out that the usual
benchmark for such evacuations
is four minutes.
Somewhat alarmingly, the
electronically locked doors
enclosing the computer labs and
support sections on the ground
floor of the building remained
locked, forcing evacuees to use
their swipe cards to get out of the
building. All of the electronic
doors are supposed to unlock
automatically whenever the fire
alarm is set off.
LS Loses Out
Newcastle University's student
newspaper 'Courier' has ousted
ULU's 'London Student' at the
Guardian / NUS Student Media
awards. Although the U L U paper
failed to win, as it had done for
the last two years, their
photographer Nik Strangelove
won the Student Photographer
award for a collection of portraits,
including one of Comedian Eddie
Izzard.
Meanwhile, James Lyonds,
Editor of Newcastle's 'Courier',
told F E L I X : "This is a
vindication of all the hard work
the team put in last year. It's
something to strive towards for
next year, and things can only get
better."
Been Caught Stealing (again)
Vinnie Ray, an ex-student of
Imperial, has again been causing
problems on campus. Mr Ray
was arrested last weekend after a
theft in the Union. College
security were alerted by a Mr
Magnossi, of Pepperdine
University, who caught Ray
stealing his jacket on Friday
night. The police were called,
and Ray was detained overnight,
but he was considered to be too
drunk to have shown any
criminal intent and was later
released.
Vinnie also tangled with
college security several years ago.
He was expelled from Imperial,
following a series of incidents,
including throwing a milk-bottle
full of dry ice and stealing the
head and tail of the Brontosaurus
outside the Natural History
Museum.
Party Poopers
After some confusion in the
Royal College of Science Union
(RCSU), first year biology
students planning to attend their
freshers' dinner have been left
with tickets but no event.
The Life Sciences inaugural
dinner planned for October 19th
was cancelled due to poor ticket
sales. The rescheduled event
clashed with a first year biology
field course.
It was decided to combine
the event with that of the
Chemistry department on
October 21st, which was also
lacking numbers, but it had been
forgotten that the Biologists were
leaving that afternoon.
Despite a respectable total of
80 people turning up for the
dinner, the first years still have
no event arranged for their
tickets.
The problem is apparently
easy to solve: "The students can
either attend the Physics dinner
on the 28th or get a discount on
the annual dinner - it's as simple
as that" said Charlie Bell, the
RCSU President.
