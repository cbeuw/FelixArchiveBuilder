After a shambolic start to the
year, the Overseas Students
Committee has managed to
assemble and has had its first
chairmen and treasurers meeting.
Intended as an umbrella
organisation to coordinate the
individual overseas clubs and
societies, the committee was
unable to convene earlier as it
started the term with only one
elected member. The elections
for this year's posts were held last
term but resulted in only the
Chairman, Andreas Mershin,
being voted in. The rest of the
positions went to New Election.
Mershin said he was put in
an 'impossible' position, blaming
the timing of the elections.
Though all the posts are now
filled, only the position of
Treasurer was contested at the
elections on October 19th.
Mershin admitted disappoint-
ment with the turnout at the
voting, but felt more encouraged
after the first meeting's
proceedings - despite spending
much of the time discussing basic
organisation when it is already
the fourth week of term.
The committee represents 25
different societies, but less than
half that number were present at
the meeting. Mershin said the
attendance was 'good for this sort
of thing' and that, compared to
the turnout at Union General
Meetings, Imperial's Overseas
Students looked fairly
enthusiastic. Referring to the size
of IC's overseas student
population he spoke of the apathy
that seems to be symptomatic of
being at Imperial: "I'm
representing 2,500 people who
don't know I'm representing
them." However, nothing has as
yet been organised; this term's
disco was originally planned as a
freshers' event - it is now
scheduled for 'sometime in
November'.
IC Russellers
BY ANDREW DORMAN
It has emerged that the Russell
Group, representing the elite
universities, was started at
Imperial College. Sir Eric Ash,
the former Rector of Imperial, has
told F E L I X that he invited the
Vice-Chancellors of the top five
research universities to discuss
similar needs on the subject of
research income.
Dr David Thomas, the Pro-
Rector (Research Contracts), has
confirmed that it was his idea to
set up the 'Group of Five' -

A FELIX-less Friday and a
Magazined Monday
The observant readers amongst
you have probably noticed that
this FELIX has arrived on
Monday - as opposed to you just
being lucky enough to find an
untouched pile of 300 copies
leftover from Friday (LS readers
please ignore and carry on as you
were - heeheeheehee).
This was due to the
installation of new litho
equipment in the Print Unit and
the subsequent loss of a days
printing time. We couldn't begin
to produce pages until Thursday:
far too late to allow FELIX to
come out before Saturday. But
the pages you are reading now
were rolled out by the new press
which hopefully bodes well. I'd
like to thank to Andy T. for his
work in securing the new litho -
your filofax is in the post...
consisting of Oxford, Cambridge,
Warwick, UCL and IC - which
first met in late 1989. It was set
up to stop industry gaining
intellectual property rights to
research which they had only
partly funded. The group
formulated agreed policy in
dealing with industry, and
lobbied Ministers. According to
Dr Thomas it was largely
successful. While the group
originally restricted membership
to the five, after Sir Eric's
departure as Rector, the numbers
increased to the present eighteen
Captain, my Captain
There are of course a great many
people behind each issue of this
newspaper and as with many
things it is often only the loudest
who are credited. But this week I
have to doff my cap to Jon Jordan
for taking the helm whilst I
graduated and balled yesterday
(and this morning). He saw most
of the magazine to print and
rather than talk about
Commemoration Day as I had
planned to (before the alcohol
strewn affair actually happened)
I'll leave the final words this
week to him. Take it away JJ...

...once again the editor
negates all responsibilities and
wanders around London, staring
intently at the bright lights
whilst quaffing back large
amounts from half empty wine
bottles. But looking at his pale
face when he eventually straggled
in this morning I knew that, as
editor-for-the-day I had had the
members.
In an interview with F E L I X ,
Sir Ronald Oxburgh, the present
Rector, said that the present
group is a caucus of "larger
institutions whose research is a
large element of their funding".
Sir Ronald dismissed claims
of a breakaway suggesting
'sensational journalism' had
exaggerated the story. He
insisted that the group wanted to
demonstrate the merits of the
present system of selective
funding by lobbying top
politicians, civil servants and
businessmen. The Rector
pointed out that the Russell
Group is only one of over half a
dozen associations whose
better deal. There are few times
that I have seen Owain stressed
out but last Thursday was one .
I remember watching the
proud parents dutifully following
their progenies around college on
commem day. Part of me wanted
to be there with them too, not
least because that would mean
that my degree was over. My
remaining parts wanted to be
there as well, not least to be
wearing a long, black gown and
run around anarchistically
pretending to be Batman.
In time I did go through
these rites of passage and
emerged out the other side as an
official graduate of Imperial
College. And as with many other
things in life I realised that the
whole event had been a sham.
Just as one of the 'best scientific
educations' had ultimately
proved to be of little value so the
crowning day of that education
was revealed as boring, full of
pomp and show and ultimately
signifying nothing. jon
membership overlaps. He also
pointed out that there is no way
to opt out of the funding system,
and that the group's main aim is
to protect research funding levels.
Meanwhile the London
School of Economics (LSE)
Students' Union has initiated
what it calls the 'Aldwych Group'
to protect student interests in
what it sees as a future 'Ivy
League'. In its first meeting the
group discussed the implications
of the Russell Group. Those
attending included senior
Student Union officials of ULU,
LSE, Cambridge and Imperial. Its
next meeting is to be held at
Imperial on 1st November.
