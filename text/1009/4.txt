Glyph's Pint
Dear Felix,
We read and enjoyed "The
Docker's Fist" by Glyph in this
year's inaugural Felix. We felt
that it was an eloquent and
humorous vilification of a lot of
the things that are wrong about
the social environment at IC.
Though it may have been a bit
over the top in places, Helen
Teasdales's highly personal attack
on Glyph (Felix 1007, letters) was
uncalled for. It was unfair of
Helen to claim that Glyph's com-
mentary dismissed the whole of
IC's student population, when he
(or she?) was concerned only with
those minorities of social misfits
whose presence has a sufficiently
high profile within IC to substan-
tially taint the social atmosphere.
Though Helen claims ignorance
of the identity of the "anorak
brigade", we're sure she must
have met them. They're those
whose only point of reference in
dealing with other people are the
marks and grades attained during
their courses here. They despise
those with marks lower than
theirs, and detest those who get
higher marks than they do.
Against this background of hostile
insecurity, they are unable to con-
structively interact with anyone.
[...]
Glyph certainly did not attack
till the beer-drinking males of IC,
only that obscene fringe whose
all-too-familiar drunken, brawling,
violent and abusive presence in
the Union Bar and Southside
spoils the appeal of these places
for many people. While they may
not all be fat and bearded, bigot-
ed they most certainly are. Helen
has obviously not had to confront
inebriated louts in the Union
attempting to pick a fight simply
because the group she was in
included an Oriental guy they
chose to make the butt of racist
"karate kid" and "slanteye" insults.
These people are a major reason
for the lack of an overseas pres-
ence in the Union bar and events.
Sufficient evidence for the prevail-
ing bigotry is also provided by the
total lack of gay and lesbian social
activity at IC.
Try as we might, we failed to
find the "Don't do Rag, it'll turn
you gay" message Helen claims is
so obvious in Glyph's article.
Quite the contrary, it seemed to us
that Glyph was claiming that at
first sight, the fact that the last two
Rag chairs have been lesbians (this
is the correct grammar to use, by
the way) would seem to add to the
appeal of Rag.
As Glyph wrote, the occasional
bit of noisy fun is harmless in
itself. It's when people confuse
having fun with making a nui-
sance of themselves, an IC trade-
mark, that objection can be raised.
[...]
If Helen doesn't understand
how having it known around IC
that one is in a relationship can
sometimes appear to be a fate
worse than death, she's obviously
not had any of the sexually
deprived pathetic little geeks of
whom there is also a substantial
fringe around here make disgust-
ing innuendo about a relationship
she was involved in. And she's
also obviously not been harrassed
by muscle-bound idiots making
stupid comments about her sexual
preferences and/or performance
just because she'd never bragged
about how many people of the
opposite sex she could get into the
underwear of in one night after a
dozen pints at the Union[...].
Helen also failed to understand
the self-deprecating humour in
Glyph's line about the dangers of
delusion on his part in thinking
that he is the only "wistful and
enigmatic" exception to the rule.
There are a lot of things wrong
about the IC environment, but one
of the good things is that there
seem to be a few people capable
of laughing at themselves. More
than anything else, we are
alarmed by the sterile rigidity of
those totally convinced of the
absolute rectitude of their micro-
fascist little doctrines. Helen ends
by superciliously stating that Glyph
fully deserves the social isolation
she groundlessly assumes he finds
himself in. In her ideal world, pre-
sumably, she could condemn any-
one she wished to the status of
social pariah, but fortunately, no
such moral and social fotalitarian-
ist autocracy prevails or, if we can
help it, will prevail.
Finally, if Glyph would like to
make him (or her) self known to
us, we'd be delighted to congratu-
late them in person and invite
them to a few rounds of their
favourite drink.
Yours etc,

/ myself thought that Glyph's
piece was slow but humourous and
enjoyable, and so support your let-
ter in his/her defence. Your points
about people not being able to
laugh at themselves and working
under rigid doctrines are very perti-
nent. In fact, if you think about it,
most of the IC categories that
you've bought up ("anoraks",
"beer drinkers", etc) suffer from
this malaise. Does anyone have
any antidotes for this disease?
I also agree with your interpre-
tation, over Helen Teasdale's, of
Glyph's ideas on Rag and gays. To
Glyph, gay is trendy and people
join Rag because they think it's
trendy.
Apologies for the editing of your

Dear Mr. Bennallack,
No doubt some of the readers
of the S-File in the edition of 14th.
of October will be relieved to
know that it will not be necessary
for the Rector to bang heads
together to obtain a College policy
on the use of World Wide Web
(WWW). In the spring of this year
the Centre for Computing Services
initiated discussions with
Academic departments, the Library
and the Administration on the
development of a Campus Wide
Information System (CWIS) for
Imperial College. This led to a
strategy paper being presented to
the College Computing Policy
Committee in May. The
Committee made recommenda-
tions to the Rector based on the
Edited this week
by Samin Ishtiaq,
Computing IV
paper, particularly with regard to
the development of WWW systems
on campus. The Rector responded
by asking for Code of Conduct for
the operation of WWW systems to
be drawn up and presented to the
Heads of Departments meeting in
June. The Code was accepted and
is now being used to provide
guidelines for the operation of the
significant number (11 plus) of
WWW systems on campus.
In essence the Code requires
the Head of Department to be
responsible for all the material
that is displayed by WWW systems
in a department, and so will lead
to appropriate procedures for vet-
ting information mounted by the
department. The Centre has
offered the Union the facility to
have a Union section on the cen-
tral College WWW system, with
the proviso that the President of
the Union must accept full respon-
sibility for any material mounted.
I understand that the Union is
considering how best to make
these WWW facilities available to
clubs and societies while observing
the necessary constraints.
I'm sure that Dr. Harrison will
be delighted to know that the
Centre, the Marketing Department
and the Registry have been work-
ing closely together to mount the
College PG prospectus on the cen-
tral College WWW, and that this is
just a first step in a closely co-ordi-
nated effort to present an attrac-
tive and very positive image of
Imperial College to the Internet.
Yours sincerely,
R.J. Hynds
Head of Centre for Computing
Services
Despite it's tortuous generation,
(I couldn't keep a straight face
through all those committees and
strategies) College's policy on
WWW is not good enough for its
students. Many Departments still do
not allow home pages, for exam-
ple, excusing themselves with
legalities. And the College's home
page is really bad compared to,
say, MIT's.
