Nothing less than a great deal more
We are the world's largest business and technology consultancy. To build on our success
we must continue to set the standards that others must follow - in the quality of our
thinking, the quality of our service and the quality of our people. That is why, when we
recruit graduates, we recruit only those who can deliver a great deal more than most in
terms of performance and potential.
In return, individuals who match our high standards can expect nothing less than the
very best: exceptional training; outstanding rewards and benefits; exciting prospects for
career development to Partner level within a demanding and meritocratic organisation.
If you are in your final year at university and are interested in finding out more about
Andersen Consulting, please come to our informal presentation at 6.00pm on Monday,
7 November 1994 at the Imperial College Conference Centre in the Ante Room.
