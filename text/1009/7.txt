"In the past the scientific
WMM community has seen
itself as the repository of all j
knowledge, and all they need to \
do is pour a bit of this out to the
grateful masses."
But there are many important j
scientists who are incompre- j
hensible to the public ?
You can't wield a big stick.
Members of the public can say '
I don't want to know anything ]
about science, thank you very!
much' and in the same way sci- j
entists can say 'I don't give a j
toss about talking to the pub-1
lie'. People have different tal-
ents and aptitudes.
HSo should communica-
tion be an option or a j
requirement?
Everyone should have the(
chance to have a go. I think if J
they had the experience ofj
being able to interest other peo-
ple in what they are doing it I
would be something they could I
| take through their lives...

"J expected
(publicity) would totally
destroy my scientific
career...because the average sci-
entist is basically toilet trained
to the point where if what he
does is comprehensible to the
general public, it means he's
not a good scientist... I was
wrong."

3 "Most members of the
public are scientifically
\ illiterate."
HWhy is there a problem
communicating sci-
ence? A lot of the problem is the
British education system. It
takes reasonably intelligent men
and women and confines them
to a science or arts career at a

"Ifs a
shame more scien-
tists are not taught to commu-
nicate better."
WsX "Our public signs don't
exceed ISO words and their
average reading age is 14/15
years. When asked to produce
signs most scientists have a
great deal of difficulty commu-
nicating in terms that the
layperson can understand.
Only a handful of staff are
really good at it."

"One of the main prob-
lems is where to pitch the
scientific explanation."
There are always pressures in
science programming to keep
high viewing figures and attract
new people to science, while not
alienating the purists. The pub-
lic has every right to be
informed about nuclear waste
and BSE

E l ence of its pedestal and
involve people in decisions about

HISTORY
young age. So you
get a large propor-
tion of administra-
tors and decision
makers who have had no scien-
tific education. This is graphi-
cally illustrated in the Brain of
Britain on Radio 4. Everyone
will know who painted the bot-
tom left hand corner of Titian's
Resurrection but no one knows
what H2O means.
KfM What is the best way to
E l explain science?
You almost have to produce a
series of campfire stories!

"Sometimes the problem
is not getting scientists
to talk but stopping them"
HShould a communica-
tions option be com-
pulsory for students?
Naturally but I would say that.
It would help students because
they'd graduate not just know-
ing 'stuff but how to make
information available to other
people
What is the key to sci-
ence communication?
To make scientists put them-
selves into someone else's per-
spective.

Bridging the gap between the
scientist and the public is a
matter of balancing the science
communication equation. The
public want to understand, but
don't have the skills. It seems
simplest to show the minority
how to educate the majority.
