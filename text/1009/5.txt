Dear Mr Bennallack
This is going to be a busy year
for me if I have to write to you
every week to put the record
straight. In the FELIX article on the
hacking into a system in
Biochemistry, I am quoted as say-
ing that CCS has "managed to
make sure that nothing like that
will happen again". What I actu-
ally said was that we had rebuilt
the system to try to make sure that
nothing like that would happen
again. There are no absolute
guarantees when it comes to com-
puter security. Kerberos is indeed
a significant improvement in secu-
rity terms, as Mr Sharp knows,
since he spent the summer work-
ing for CCS to investigate the pos-
sibilities for installing Kerberos
campus wide on the workstation
clusters for which we are responsi-
ble. He also wrote a report for us
which pinpointed the problems
associated with that proposal.
Yours sincerely
R.J. Hynds
Head of Centre for Computing
Services
Obviously there are no security
guarantees for an academic net-
work, which by its nature needs to
be open. Mr Sharp claims that
College should be using Kerberos
and Mr Hynds agrees with its supe-
riority. Is there a problem with its
implementation at College? This
might be a technical argument
within CCS, but it effects all of us.
War?
Dear Fiona,
You accuse of me ignorant atti-
tudes, could you point out when I
demonstrated these traits? The
whingeing, was also not of my
doing, but another member of the
party. But you assume it was me
because Imade the most noise
with my last letter (What was that
about mistaken identity?). As to
whether I have a life - you don't
know me, nor do I wish to know
you, so your judgement is (a) with-
out foundation, and (b) stupid.
I've been visiting clubs for the last
three years, and never been
kicked out of one. Note also that
the Automatic night at the Gass (A
small but pleasant club in the
West End) also charges three
pounds entry. Their officals did not
tell me to get a life.
I stand by the assertion that
three pounds admission was too
expensive. Entry is free on a
Wednesday - from this, is it rea-
sonable to assume that a bar
extension pays for itself?
Your only point of substance in
a well written, but otherwise 'con-
tent free' letter was that the order
to remove us did not come from
the president. For that I apologise
to her for my last letter.
Also, a note to last week's let-
ters ed. - I know exactly who L-U-
C-Y is. She was drumming up
support in our hall for her election
campaign. I was also at the
Hustings last year, AND she was
the highest ranking union official I
saw at the gates of the quad that
night.

Well, Fiona, you asked for fur-
ther abuse! I'm sorry, but this is just
a slagging match of the least con-
structive kind. As they say in com-
puting, Poon, >null.
Small Thanx
for a Big Man
Dear Owain,
May I use this little space to
thank a very big gentleman; Steve
Newhouse. Last year he made
great fuss of the photographic
team, and today I walk into the
darkroom to find two new pieces
of equipment which cost at least
1/6 of last year's darkroom bud-
get.
Cheers, Steve!
Ivan Chan ,
Diana Harrison
Photography sub-editors
Cheers!? Just Cheers? Come on,
Ivan and Diana, you can be at least
as generous as Xavier, George and
Benjamin (see the first letter) and
buy the man a pint.
Letters Deadline: Monday
6.00pm. Note that your letter may
be commented on by a guest edi-
tor. Also, letters may be cut due to
space restrictions. The guest edi-
tors opinions are not neccesarily
those of the editor.
