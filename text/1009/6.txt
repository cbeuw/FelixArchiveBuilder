Science has fundamentally changed our culture. Yet peo-
ple's understanding of science is poor. TV shows like Horizon, and
Equinox are hugely popular. But the public still finds science diffi-
cult to understand. The S-Files searched its archives and interview a
X-section of scientists/educators/media, on the silent scientists and
the weak links in the communications chain.

Do you have any difficulty getting scientists to talk in sim-
ple terms?
When you are researching a science piece, it helps to be a scientists,
there are a lot of shortcuts, i.e. jargon and shorthand when talking to
scientists.
Are you interpreting science for the public?
I did the MSc course in Science Communication Q£H al Imperial
College. It's essentially about building a bridge between the layman
and the scientist £E>.
Are there a hard-core of scientists that are good communicators,
or are they all bad?
When you're doing a program you will say "Who do we know who's
a good talker?" The most crucial part is that you want to speak to
whoever is doing the frontline research. But then you ask, "Is he a
good talker?" If he starts rambling off into some scientific flight of
fancy, then he's no good.

WmMi does not get his point across, it is a complete waste of time."
