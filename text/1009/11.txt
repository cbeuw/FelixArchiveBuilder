Careers
Dear Fresher,
Advicefrom John Simpson, Director ofIC Careers Service.
Welcome to Imperial College. The next
three or four years should be among the
most interesting and enjoyable in your
life, provided you make the most of the
opportunities available at College. This
letter aims to give you some ideas for
your own self-development.
You can probably recall one of the
significant steps in your life when you
entered the sixth form or went to sixth
form college. Coming to College is an
even more significant step. You have
more freedom, more independence and
more opportunities to do your own thing
and to succeed or fail.
If you do not make
some mistakes you
will not have learnt
anything, learning
from one's own mis-
takes is an important
part of experience, but
don't waste time re-
inventing everything, build on the expe-
rience of others - take advice (it's usually
free) - ignore some of it, test it out,
accept or reject it.
You have already demonstrated
some planning ability by passing 'A' lev-
els, or their equivalent, sufficiently well
to be at College. How are you going to
plan the next three, four or six years?
And I'm not talking just about
your academic studies, I'm
talking about the start
of the rest of
your life.
What do you want to achieve this
term? Making friends is usually high on
most people's list. How? Join clubs and
societies, attend meetings, take up a new
sport, develop a new interest - any of
these are likely to bring you into contact
with like-minded students. And there's
always the bar to prop up while seeking
inspiration.
By the end of the summer term in
your first year you are feeling the finan-
cial pressures - in other words you're
broke! So how about earning some good
money in the long vacation? If you leave
job hunting until the
vacation starts you may
"HOW are yOU going tO be too late. AH the inter-
plan the next three,
four or sixyears?"
esting and lucrative jobs
have been filled already
and you will be lucky if
the local council wants
some grass cutting or the
garden centre needs a
dirty pair of hands. It's well worthwhile
doing some preliminary job hunting
between Christmas and Easter. Call in at
the IC Careers Service (Room 310,
Sherfield Building) where you will find
information about Vacation Training,
write to employers with your CV, call in
to some local shops and hotels and see
who's advertising in the local press.
Vacation jobs can be most informa-
tive. Ideally they give you the chance to
try out some type of work or future
employer in which you are interested.
They give you experience in job hunting,
letter writing and interviews, as well as a
real insight into what it's like to work for
a particular type of employer. Some even
pay you quite well. Jobs abroad are
popular and early applications
are essential. Start by visiting
the IC Careers Service which
has a good range of reference
books and
addresses.

work, I hear you say. Yes, it does take
some effort on your part but generally
speaking the more effort you put into
something the more enjoyment you will
get out of it.
Committee work is excellent prepa-
ration for life after College. You learn to
set agendas, run meetings, agree actions,
persuade other students to do things,
work within budgets and end up with a
successful event - a party, a visit, a play
or a newspaper. (Think how much effort
went into producing this edition of
F E L I X ! ) .
You should start thinking seriously
about your future career before the end
of the second year. Even if you haven't a
clue what you want to do, that's no
excuse for delayingfindingout about the
possibilities. You are surrounded with
sources of information - friends, family,
tutors, careers advisers, libraries. Start
looking. It may be a long process but so
is life, so it really is worth spending
more time thinking about your career
than planning your next weekend or hol-
iday.
The IC Careers Service is a good
starting place. Pop in and speak to the
information staff. Find out about
'PROSPECT', our computer careers
guidance system, and all the information
booklets and reference files. Have a look
at some of the videos, attend some semi-
nars on careers, get yourself sorted out.
The Milkround is in the spring
term of your final year. This is when
employers visit campuses to interview
applicants or invite you to their London
Offices.
Christmas vacation courses are a
popular way of finding out about careers
such as marketing but only a few major
recruiters run them and they are normal-
ly over-subscribed many times.
Stop! I'm only a
fresher - why are you
telling me all this?
I'm telling you
because you need to
start planning your
life now, don't just
drift through College
and emerge with a
degree and nothing
else. Of course a degree is important and
must be yourfirstpriority, but not your
only priority.
In the meantime, enjoy yourself.
