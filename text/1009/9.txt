Clued Up

Being in my final studious year at
Imperial, your Frater is faced with
the problem of the future. In order
to aid the crystallisation of my inde-
cision, the advice makers abound
with comments, the most popular
being 'whatever makes you the
most happy'. Happy? I scream. I
t
seems to me that the elevation of
the value of happiness is one of the
prime causes of the modern
malaise. 50% of marriages col-
lapse, juveniles turn to crime or
drugs, gay couples rear socially
stunted children, and why?
Because these people have been
deluded into believing that what
they need most in life is happiness.
They strive for it in whatever dis-
torted way they can, belittling and
wasting others as they do so. Those
who fail to achieve it feel that they
have been cheated from some
divine right, and spew their guts to
some measly counsellor.
Besides, happiness is
such an ill defined concept- as with
all emotions any attempt at classifi-
cation will simpy bite at its own tail,
as it cannot be defined without self
reference (thus being classed as an
'elemental' by your Frater).
Another such elemental is Quality,
and those who have aquainted
themselves with the twinned arts of
zen and motorcycle maintenance
will be aware of the dangers of
seeking the defenition of an ele-
mental. I
t can only drive you into
lunacy, ECT and fame as a popular
writer.
I will let you into a little
secret. Happiness is important.
Pain, however, is also a part of life
as are sadness, hate, love and
POLITICAL
SCIENCE
I saw Francois Girard's 32 Short
Films About Glenn Gould at the
Riverside Studios recently. Girard
presents a beautiful and sympa-
thetic portrait of Gould, who is, in
many ways, the perfect artist. One
of Gould's theories is that the
artist-audience ratio should be 0-1.
As I understand it, this means an
anonymous artist producing work
for a single person. Gould's idea is
to take away the commercial
atmosphere from the production of
art.
The notion of an anonymous
artist presents some interesting
possibilities. I
n particular, the idea
of an anonymous producer of art.
We might want to ask: can Science
be done like this? Can the scientist
be anonymous? Why do we need
to know whose theory it is? For
example, why do we need to know
that it is Einstein's Theory of
Relativity, and not just Theory of
Relativity Number X08? Is there
something, perhaps, in the way sci-
ence is done that prevents an
anonymous scientist?
There are, of course, anony-
mous theories around. The
Student's t-distribution in statistics,
for instance. But in modern times,
this is a rarity.
Is modernity the key to the
issue, then? ("Things aren't what
they used to be.." - I don't neces-
sarily agree with the idea that
morals have declined over time;
depression. Your Frater himself has
been through the dark abyss, that
realm of utter despair and self
loathing- but it was important to be
there, as all emotions are vital to
the totality of one's life. Vital they
are, but it is worthless to have them
as your goal. I escaped that bleak
region but now, as then, I do not
seek happiness- What I seek above
all is fulfillment, which is the
achievement of one's will. One's
route to fulfillment is an innately
personal matter. Sadly my will
directs me to gain a total under-
standing of reality; it takes but a
fool to realise the futility of that
task.
All is nothing.
it's just that we now know more
about other people). Is it the scien-
tist's selfishness and vanity that
forces him to name a theory as
his? A successful theory, or one
that causes controversy, will give
him a reputation. The reputation
will help advance his standing and
softens the path for his next theory.
But there are some positive
reasons why theories should be
tagged with their owners. Whether
science is done by experimentally
arriving at some theory or by mak-
ing Conjectures and Refuting them,
the inventor of the theory is the
one responsible for it. He might
advance his reputation by a good
theory but a bad theory might also
destroy it. Even worse, a bad theo-
ry would distract the scientific com-
munity from 'real' work. The buck
must stop somewhere: the name
tells us where this is.
Theories which have their
inventors' names also personalise
science; they humanise it. The gen-
eral impression is of science as
some great, hulking machine. A
bulldozer which advances steadily
but surely, wiping out all life in its
way. But by saying that this part of
the machine comes from Einstein,
that from Turing, the process of sci-
ence is made just that slightly more
accessible. Indeed, popular biogra-
phies telling us that Einstein was a
womaniser, that Turing was gay,
only add to this accessability.
Science is no longer a machine
with, or even worse, without, its
own mind. I
t is now made up of
peoples' ideas.
