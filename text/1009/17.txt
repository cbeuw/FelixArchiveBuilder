For our opening night of theatre, tintin takes a peek at the
stress of everyday living as demonstrated in the one-woman
show, Panic.
Messers James Thomson from Computing 1 and A/ok Jha from
Physics 1 set to the week's singles with a passion that
Geoffrey Howe would be proud of (that's political satire).
Patrick Wood goes back to school in the company of the
Browing Version's sepia tones, whilst Magpie swoops over
the wreck that is Major League II.
Vik vainly tries to hype the Cult and tintin hangs out with Lisa
Germano, what a geek! Ying and Yang also go gigging with
Drugstore, the Kitchens, Dub-War and Blaggers ITA.
Fashionable Fiona heads east my friends and encounters the
minimal charms of High St Ken's newest arrival; Muji.
Let Alok (above right) and James
(above left) lead your ears
onwaras.
Mantaray - adoration
[J]; taking a page out of the Blur
book, definitely wortb a listen or 3
the Mission - raising coin
[A]; it's completely inconsequential.
[J]; I disagree. It's a mix of
Depeche Mode and the Cure,
resulted in three very dark, moody
songs.

After touring the old colonial
world, the self described "all-time
heretic Essex girl", Petra Massey,
has returned to blighty with Panic;
"a tragic one-woman comedy".
Her one-woman character,
Frankie, has enough hang ups for
an entire wardrobe. You know the
sort of things. General phobias
and regular worries, like worrying
that you might unconsciously
stand on a table and begin
masturbating at parties or the
disconcerting habit of confusing
the phrases "pass me the butter
darling" with "get out of my
******* life you balding, french
******•". Just the normal stuff of
everyday modern life.
Frankie sits in her bedroom
in the hour before dawn, the hour
sandwiched between 'being
frightened of the night and scared
of the day' and tells us her story.
It's a story of collecting the rubbish
of life, throwing away the
relationships, dreaming dreams,
getting run over and salving panic
attacks with tuneless ukulele
playing. While, of course, being a
tragic comedy. Except that I got
the feeling it was more a comic
tragedy, in a modern sense. Most
of the time when you were
laughing it was at pretty sad
events which is always a bit
disconcerting. (This excludes the
members of the audience who
decided it was just a comedy and
proceeded to laugh at everything
and that included the phrase
"warm urine bottle". Gee, the
British sense of humour...) Still 50
minutes is a long time for that type
of play to hold an audience and
Panic carried it off for most of the
time. 0
At first sight The Browning
Version looks like a showcase for
old-fashioned attitudes and older
buildings. It opens with lush shots of
the Abbey School (with its Great
Hall "built in 1550", as the porter
helpfully informs us) and continues
with lots of close-ups of emotionally
constipated Englishmen keeping
their upper lips stiff.
Andrew Crocker-Harris (Albert
Finney), a middle-aged public
school Classics teacher, is
incompatibly married to Laura
(Greta Scacchi, not getting her kit
off). While his wife is having an
affair with young American physics
teacher, Frank (Matthew Modine),
the Croc is being gently elbowed
out of his job. He's prepared to take
this on the chin like the good
Anglo-Saxon that he is. It's only
after receiving an unexpected gift
from a pupil that he's able to
attempt some form of self-assertion
in his farewell speech.
Science replaces Greek,
American openness supersedes
English rectitude - there are
undercurrents that might not
interest the casual viewer. In the
Hollywood remake the Browning of
the title would be the gunsmith
rather than the poet. In an epilogue
grafted on by Gabriel Garcia
Marquez, Frank and the Croc would
blow each other away in the library
after prep in an orgy of macho
posturing. As it is, in the English
version everyone remains impassive
for most of the time, while the
swelling soundtrack lets us know
they're repressing their feelings like
mad. It's low-key, but carefully done
and with an excellent central
performance from Albert Finney,
although he does look at least ten
years too old for the part.
After seeing Major League II
one thing came to mind - major
cock up. The first film had such a
witty story line with the Cleveland
Indians, a mixture of would bes and
has beens, winning their league.
However this time the plot is almost
the same, the team has fallen back
into their old rhythm, losing, with
Corbin Bernsen as the new owner of
the Indians and Tom Berenger
ending up as coach. The film's only
comedy comes from inverting the
characters behaviour as compared
to the original film. Charlie Sheen's
Wild Thing has lost his rebellious
side, donning Armani suits and
basically appearing as the squeaky
clean boy next door. The voodoo
guy, who could never hit curve
balls, returns to the new season
having become a buddhist and so
loves everyone and anything. The
film is not funny and you just
wonder how Sheen, Berenger and
Bernsen ended up making such a
crap film?
Major League I
I drags on for
far too long, and the only question
is - why did they want to make a
sequel? The film makers obviously
hope that Sheen, Berenger and
Bernsen will sell the movie. I wish
them luck. ©
