An old story of what can happen is that of the sea
otter, hunted and killed for its very smooth fur. It has
been said that there are approximately 800 million
hairs in each pelt. Its troubles were at a peak when
the Chinese Mandarins were introduced to this richest
of pelts by Russian hunters. This led to entire herds
being wiped out, the population of Otters falling from
150,000 in 1740 to just over 1000 in 1911. A treaty
was then signed by representatives from the United
States, Great Britain (for Canada), Russia, and Japan.
The Otters were given complete protection, and
thankfully, their numbers have now recovered
somewhat. Sadly, it now faces other threats from
entanglement in fishermen's nets, and oil spills.
LYNX is even opposing the wearing of fake fur,
saying that glamourising fur in any way is wrong.
Their attitude is that furs are beautiful-but only on
their rightful owners, the fur- bearing animals. After
high-lighting the fact that OXFAM had been selling
second hand furs, LYNX has persuaded them not to
accept donations of fur, and all stocks of fur were
withdrawn on March 1st this year.
Many of those women who own a fur coat, now
refuse to wear them. Models are paid extra for the
social stigma of wearing Mink coats, and many refuse
even to wear one. This effect is not international as
yet, and only The Netherlands has been affected as
much as Britain, although fur is at last struggling to
stay in fashion in the United States, which accounts
for about a third of the $6 Billion market. LYNX has
opened an office in Los Angeles, and is planning to
start a similar publicity campaign in Western Europe,
using its 'Rich Bitch. Poor Bitch' posters.
In Kenya, hundreds of thousands of pounds of illegal
wildlife products are being destroyed. Recently, a
bonfire was lit to destroy over three tons of ivory,
whilst in Brazil, thousands of furs from illegally killed
endangered species were incinerated. This removes
the items from circulation, with the view that the
items have no monetary value anyway. LYNX will be
holding its own ceremonial bonfire of fur coats later
in the year.
