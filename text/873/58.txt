Misc.
867 Ballet at Sadler's
A number of dance companies visit Sadler's Wells
every year. These are as diverse as Stravinsky to
Joplin, each with it's own impact. The dance is
contemporary, shattering any esoteric image.
857 BBC Radio
For the price of a tube ticket you can see the stars
of radio record their acts. The BBC need audiences
so they give out free tickets. Comedy, quizzes and
music for free at the Paris Studio, Regent St.
842 The Body - In Extremis
ICA season of horror, well suited to the sinister arty
air about the place, blowing down from the eerie
Charing Cross subway. 'I liked the bit where his head
fell off.'
870 Clarissa
Opera
847 Dance Umbrella '89
A concentrated season of dance with a varied menu
of French sensuality, English wit and American
pioneering. Five London venues host six weeks of
dance from October. Don't be a couch potato.
842 Indian Summer
A season of dance, but the review was by MAC and
so nobody understands it.
843 Jazz Cafe
Intimate cafe", with jazz band in front room, covering
whole range of jazz. Food is good, with impressive
vegetarian and vegan dishes. Not cheap, but beats
pub and juke box.
872 LSO: Mahler 2
Ignoring the embarrassing conductor and the awful
first half of the programme, the LSO's performance
of this symphony can only be described as
exhilarating.
865 Magnum
Exhibition of work from the photographers'
consortium. Images of war combine with human and
humanesque images to tell stories in a way that
television has never been able to accomplish.
