D E S S E R T Mad Dash is holding one of her tambourine parties.
At the end of the main course, Mad Dash bangs her
tambourine and everyone gets up and moves to a
different seat. From the information given below,
identify each person with the descriptions, determine
the position of each person during the main course and
then during the dessert, and identify the hobbyhorse
(favorite topic of conversation) of each.
1. Tambourine party rules. Derek Dash and Mad Dash,
who is a moderate drinker, never sit adjacent to each
other. They like to keep each other's seat warm for
each other for when it comes time to bang that
tambourine. Derek Dash enjoyed his starter and main
course at the head of the table in seat 1.
2. The person who enjoys discussing student issues
with a sympathetic ear, never sat beside the person
who partook of dessert while in seat 4. The person
with responsibility for an awful lot of students did not
sit in seat 3 during the main course.
3. The sherry merchant was pleased to sit through
both courses next to the heavy mead drinker, who
spent the pauses between nibbles pondering the
heady dragon-slaying days of auld.
4. The two ladies sat next to each other during only
one course.
5. Kneel McColostomy, who, as everyone knows, is
not an important person at all, but who does enjoy
talking about the advantages of being the most
important person at Imperial College, sat in the two
even numbered seats, unlike the batchelor (who is
married!) who did not sit in either of the even seats.
6. The most important person in College is a very
modest person, and preferred to discuss his petunias
and forget-me-nots over dinner.
