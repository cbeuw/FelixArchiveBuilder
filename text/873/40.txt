We have received several
letters on the following
theme:
I went to a party last
Friday. It w a s a dinner and
there w a s lots of alcohol
around. It w a s really good
fun, but I got very drunk
and I don't remember a lot
of what I d i d . People keep
c o m i n g up t o me and
telling me I did lots of
dreadful things that I can't
remember, like molesting
several members of the
opposite sex.
I don't k n o w whether t o
believe them, but I'm really
embarrassed. What should
I do?

It was very silly of you
to drink so much. And
yes, you did do all those
things everyone said and I'm
never going to speak to you
again! The bet's off.

I have to spend a lot of
time m a k i n g speeches to
young people. Over the
past four years, I've
become very worried that
they don't really respect
me and that they are
laughing at me behind my
back. I also worry that
they are writing nasty
things about m e and
passing these around.
I a m keen t o encourage
young people into taking
up a sport a n d a social
activity and I also like
advising them on aspects
of DIY, s u c h as painting
rooms. However, I'm
worried that this isn't
having the right effect o n
them. Do you think I'm
being paranoid?

Perhaps the young
people you're talking to
find you distant and
unapproachable. Remember
that young people don't like
being condescended to. If you
respect them, I'm sure they'll
respect you.
I don't think you have to worry
about them writing things
down about you. After all, not
many people will see it.
Perhaps you should moderate
you enthusiasm for your
hobbies. After all, not
everyone shares them.

I a m just about to start a new
job. To get it I had to be
velvety, sabre toothed, ice-
cool and satirical. I a m really
looking forward to it, but I
have one s m a l l problem. I
have just taken s o m e exams
and if I don't pass them, I
won't be able to do the job.
I have had trouble
academically over the past
five years, having t o retake
several sets of exams. I've
always managed t o scrape
through in the past, but I
won't be allowed t o retake
these and I'm really worried.
I tried w o r k i n g hard for them,
but I'm very frightened I
haven't done well enough.
I'm so worried, m y hairline
has started receding and I've
started s m o k i n g lots more
than usual. What c a n I do?

If your exams are, its too
late to do anything. You
should have worked harder
earlier. But I'm sure if you don't
pass, there are lots of other
things you can do, like work for
Harrods.

M y hubby has just gotten a
Knighthood from your cute
little English Queen and I
guess we'll be meeting
some pretty important
people n o w . I'm just a
little worried I w o n ' t k n o w
what to do. I m e a n , in
A m e r i c a w e don't have all
this class thing and I guess
it wouldn't g o d o w n too
well if I called your queen
'Lizzie', w o u l d it?
I also guess I don't really
k n o w what to do with all
that cutlery you get at
these posh occasions. Only
last week, m y hubby had
to tell me not to eat m y
melon with the steak knife.
What c a n I do?

I recommend Emily
Post's book of etiquette.
That should put your mind at
rest on all the important
points. But etiquette is
becoming less important these
days as I'm sure you know.
Remember, the most important
way to make sure you're not
too rude is not to impose
yourself too much on other
people.

I a m very worried about a
problem w h i c h seems t o
have haunted me
throughout m y life. I seem
to be disaster prone.
Whatever I become
involved in always seems
to turn into a nightmare,
w h i c h takes more time t o
solve than the original
problem. M y job requires a
lot of organisation, w h i c h I
just don't seem capable of.
I have tried taking brick
laying lessons and have
even attempted t o learn
something about
computers. The results of
my labours are a pile of
rubble and a bargain
basement, full of
networked Z X Spectrums.
I want to change, but m y
d u m b hunk nature seems
to stop me every time.

Your case seems a
hopeless one. You
should retire from your job and
take up a career in hod
carrying. The photograph you
have enclosed seems to
indicate that you may be able
to carry the bricks with the aid
of your enlarged, alcoholic
midriff instead of a hod. If hod
carrying proves too mentally
strenuous and responsible a
position for you, why not try
grave digging—you seem quite
good at making your own.
