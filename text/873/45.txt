Tragical History Tours
If all this talk of walking has made you feel tired
already, how about a coach trip? Whilst booking is not
strictly necessary it is highly recommended, as the
tours are very popular.

A Bus Trip to Murder
Leaves from outside Temple Underground at 7.15pm
week-days (Embankment Underground Sundays and
Bank Holidays). Phone to confirm.
Sunday evening and Embankment was packed. Nearly
sixty people were waiting for the coach. Some,
without reservations, didn't get on. Sitting near the
back, I was glad of the repeater loudspeakers, which
sounded good.
Setting off, we briefly touched on The Man in Grey,
Here, well in the ladies toilet to be precise, a
poltergeist sometimes pulls the chain on unsuspecting
victims. No sighting today unfortunately, but you can
buy sweatshirts of the tour here.
Motoring through Blackwall Tunnell, we learnt of
its mysterious biker, then on to Chalton House where
one room is kept locked between 9pm and 2am ever
since ghostly attacks were reported. Not leaving the
coach, we headed off to a fine mansion, a beautiful
sunset view over London and down into Historic
Greenwich to see the Cutty Sark and to eat. We had
an hour in Greenwich so I sampled the wares. I didn't
have cake and coffee as quite a few did, but a tasty
pie and chips from £3.00.
Whilst the coach took us back to Embankment, our
guide expounded on the company's theory as to who
exactly Jack the Ripper was. I won't let the cat out
of the bag, but it involves Royalty, Masons and
assassinations...
The tour ends at 10.45pm with plenty of time to
get home. I enjoyed this trip even though I live near
Greenwich. It is rare for tours to come so far, so it
was a pity that it was so late. It's good value for a
coach trip though I thought the treatment of the
subject matter was a little too jovial. Still, the
American boy sitting next to me thought it was
'great!'.
The round nave peculiar to Templar churches.
Again, I enjoyed the tour, although I would have
preferred to keep moving on, rather than to talk at
length about a particular spot. I liked visiting various
different interiors but if you would prefer to stick with
the legal system there is a tour of the inns of court,
Royal Courts and the Old Bailey which leaves Temple
Underground at 10am on days when this tour runs.
Contacts
You can find listings of walks in the three London
Guides; in Time Out under 'Around Town', in What's
On in the 'Diary' section and in City Limits under
'Tracks'. The best is probably What's On as this also
gives telephone numbers. It's available in newsagents
and at the London Tourist Office in the basement of
Harrods. Here you can pick up some of the
programmes on offer or you can ring the companies

'denotes a large number of walks every week
Walks normally start outside a tube station at the main
entrance or in the ticket hall. No booking is required,
just turn up and buy a ticket from the guide. Tours
normally take place whatever the weather and there
is no minimum number for a tour to take place.
Equally, of course, a large crowd may turn up.
Charlton House, the site of many hauntings. Several times, in a quest for the heir he never had
a ghostly Gentleman has assulted young ladies after dark.
London's most famous theatre ghost, and Sweeney
Todd, the only non-factual story of the evening. We
then headed off into the East End to cover the
haunting (or hunting) ground of Jack the Ripper. Our
guide launched zealously into gory descriptions of the
murders as we got as close as possible in our warm
coach. These tours are definitely not for those of a
nervous disposition but my (mainly American)
companions lapped it up.
We stopped in Bow for a drink in a haunted pub.
The Evening Ghost Bus
Every Thursday and Sunday evening at 7.00pm from
Temple and Embankment respectively. Ring to
confirm.
A trip to Chislehurst Caves, with an introduction to
the homes of at least five authenticated ghosts.
Wander 22 miles of passages including the carvings,
the druids' altar, the haunted pool and the Dr Who
cave, complete with Daleks.
