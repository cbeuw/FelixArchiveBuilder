Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
I
f you’re an Apple lover
we’ve had quite a week.
As you can see above
Apple announced its
iPhone 4 at WWDC 2010, but
that’s not all Apple was show-
ing off. iPhone OS has been
renamed iOS, which isn’t ex-
actly a surprise considering
it now powers three different
iDevices. Apple released the
Golden Master (read: feature
complete) iOS4 to developers,
which was promptly spread
across the greater internet. So
if you’re an iPhone 3G/3GS
wielder and want it now, and
have a Mac for iTunes 9.2, you
can install iOS4 right now and
not have to wait till June 21st.
Indeed there was even better
news for iPhone 3Gers as some
industrious fellows found that
if you jailbreak an iPhone 3G
with iOS4 on it, you can enable
both multitasking and home
screen wallpaper with a quick
edit to a small settings file. Ap-
ple doesn’t want you to have
these features on your 3G, but
after some experience with it
I can tell you it runs just fine;
Apple be damned.
Safari 5 was also released
this week at WWDC fea-
turing a 30% increase
in speed and Safari
Reader, a readability
based tool that strips
out everything but
the goods of an arti-
cle, so you can read it
without distractions.
Google’s search index is now
fully caffeinated as it has rolled
out its new, faster search al-
gorithm, Caffeine, to the rest
of its data centres. You might
not notice much of a speed
increase, but believe me it is
faster, it was just pretty fast to
begin with.
Twitter this week gave a pre-
announcement that it’s going
to start wrapping all links in its
own link shortening service
‘t.co’ automatically. Bad
news for link shorten-
ing services like ‘bit.
ly’, as Twitter is go-
ing to do it transpar-
ently and on the fly,
meaning you won’t
have to shorten your own
URLs before tweeting them.
It may even be the case that
you don’t see the shortened
URL in the tweet either, just
the expanded one.
Twitter also let out some
interesting subscriber stats
showing that they have over
190 million users and that
they tweet 65 million times
a day, which is up 30% since
April. According to Costolo,
Twitter’s COO, most users
don’t tweet at all, but just read
others’ tweets. It’s also not
clear how many of those 65m
tweets a day are automated
spam tweets.
Microsoft announced that
its Windows 7 Service Pack 1
will hit public
beta in July.
Mainly con-
taining bug
fixes and
patches,
SP1 does
include new
Remote
Desktop
support for
Windows Server 2008
SP1 features. Handy if you
need some remote support,
but frankly boring for anyone
else.
Google’s Nexus One got
a shot in the arm thanks to
some clever Android hacking,
which enabled 720p video re-
cording from its 5MP camera.
It’s not currently available for
Froyo, but it’ll only be a mat-
ter of time. That’s the beauty
of an open source OS, anyone
can get stuck in and modify
the ROM without too much
trouble.
And finally, as it’s nearly
World Cup time, how about
a David Beckham story? Ya-
hoo have managed to sign
Becks to be the public face of
their World Cup and Premier
League coverage. Dave will get
his own channel where he’ll
share his own experiences of
the World Cup. Then during
the forthcoming Premiership
season, fans will be able to
contact Goldenballs through
Y!Messenger and Y!Mail. Nice.
iPhone 4 - Here’s what you need to know
Samuel Gibbs shows you what’s what with Apple’s latest and greatest, a fourth generation smartphone
A4 processor
Apple’s own A4 CPU from the iPad
has been squeezed into the iPhone;
powerful yet power sipping.
9.3mm thin
The iPhone 4 is 24% thinner than the
iPhone 3GS making it the thinnest
smartphone available.
FaceTime
iPhone 4 comes with video chat
called FaceTime. It works over WiFi
and needs no configuration, working
with both front and back cameras.
802.11n + BT
Finally WiFi-N for high speed web
browsing, email, video and FaceTime,
joining the already present BlueTooth
2.1 + EDR for music and headset
support.
Two cameras
A front-facing VGA camera joins a
5MP backside illuminated shooter on
the back capable of HD 720p 30FPS
video with enhanced low-light
sensitivity and an LED flash.
Glass front & back
The scratch resistant hardened glass
covering the front now covers the
back too, bolting into a stainless steel
frame that forms part of the antenna
for the phone’s various radios.
3.5” Retina Display
960x640 IPS display with massive
326 ppi (denser than the human eye
can see) and a 800:1 contrast ratio.
Key Features
3-axis gyro
iPhone 4 packs a 3-axis gyro adding
to the existing digital compass,
accelerometer and GPS for 6-axis
motion sensing. Great for games.
Dual mics
Oneforvoicecallsonthebottomand
another for noise cancellation on top.
Bigger battery
Apple has managed to squeeze in
a 16% bigger battery in the iPhone
4. Combined with the A4 provides
7hrs talk, 10 hours video, 40 hours of
music and 300 hours of standby time.
H
ere it is folks, I give you the
iPhone 4! Yes, after much
rumour and speculation,
leaked prototypes and
court cases, Apple’s iPhone 4 has offi-
cially been unveiled. Steve Jobs took to
the stage of the WWDC 2010 opening
keynote to show off his latest creation.
OK, so there’s nothing truly revolu-
tionary here, but it’s a very compre-
hensive package that is going to sell
like hot cakes. The highlights include a
screen that’s got a higher pixel density
than the human eye can differentiate
at over 320 pixels per inch. Apple calls
it the Retina Display and what it es-
sentially means is that text and images
look incredibly crisp.
Apple’s packed its little burner of
a processor, the A4, into the iPhone
4, which we’ve seen previously in the
iPad. The rear camera has been im-
proved with backside illumination and
bumped up to 5MPs, which should
make shooting in low-light conditions
better. It’ll also provide you with 720p
HD video recording at 30fps, which
you can now edit right on the device
with a portable version of iMovie.
iPhone 4 also come with a VGA
camera on the front ready for Apple’s
FaceTime, a zero configuration iPhone
4 to iPhone 4 Wifi-only (for now)
video calling service that looks great.
Whether you’ll use it, I don’t know.
The battery is now 14% bigger, whilst
the phone has thinned by 24% to an
anorexic 9.3mm thick. Both front and
back are made of hardened glass held
together by a stainless steel band. Solid.
Yours from June 24th with pre-orders
starting on the 15th on most networks.
