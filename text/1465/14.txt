An unusually intelligent rock record,
this sounds a little like the politicised
punk-rock that Green Day have been
churning out for the last five years, but
with less posturing and, impressively, a
more introspective attitude. Although
largely unknown in the UK, the Florida
rockers have been turning out punk
records for over a decade now, and the
experience seems to have mellowed
and deepened their sound in a way that
lifts them beyond the mass-production
punk-pop dominating the charts.

Ah, the obligatory pretentious art-rock
offering. Falsetto? Check. Quirky
time signatures? Check. It’s a regular
collection of Bloc Party-u-like clichés.
The choppy timing has the unfortunate
effect of making the record sound like
you’re listening to it on Atlantic 252 on
long wave - fading in and out so rap-
idly that it’s almost impossible to listen
to without checking to see if the CD’s
skipping. Avoid.

Back when Propane Nightmares came
out, I really thought Pendulum were
on to something. Since then, though,
they’ve gone the way of Linkin Park:
although the ingredients are there, the
end product is simply less than the sum
of its parts. Watercolour is no excep-
tion - while the energy is there and the
bassline does its job, it sounds anodine,
clinical and joyless: like it was written
to appeal to radio audiences rather than
because it was fun. I really want to like
Pendulum, but that isn’t likely to hap-
pen until they go back to what they’re
good at.

Once a scientist, always a scientist?
After studying Physics for 4 years and completing a PhD in Neuroscience, Valeria Del Prete (a.k.a Double
Thumb) quit academia to pursue her dream of making music

Look around the library and you’ll
see it. In those idle moments between
productive bursts of revision, students
daydreaming of a more glamourous
life; I could have played for England, I
could quit and go traveling or perhaps
I could be a rockstar. For Valeria Del
Prete these daydreams grew and grew
until one day, after a Masters in Phys-
ics, a PhD and a year of post-doc study,
she finally decided it was time to turn
dreams to reality.
We’re sitting outside the Builder’s
Arms near Gloucester Road and she’s
joking about how she still managed to
get lost even though she’s spent a lot
of time around Imperial through her
work assisting and tutoring a disabled
Imperial Physics student. She’s just
recently finished a degree in Vocal
Production at Thames Valley Univer-
sity and like many Imperial students, is
feeling refreshed after weeks of exams.
But how does an academic from Italy
end up producing music in her bed-
room in Acton that Radio 6’s Tom Rob-
inson called “more original than 95% of
the mundane nonsense churned out by
“professional” studios and labels these
days” and “possibly the most assured
debut recording I’ve heard by a UK
artist since “The Wizard” by Bat For
Lashes.”?
“I’ve always loved music. I started
playing piano when I was 3 on this one
octave piano and at the beginning I
was just banging the same chord but I
just naturally progressed with it. And
when I was a teenager I was in a few
bands. Rock bands mainly, playing
stuff like Van Halen”
She laughs at her younger self, faintly
embarrassed at the memory.
“I have a very soft voice now, so you
can imagine me at 15 trying to sing
Van Halen. I still have some recordings
and they’re just hilarious.”
The inevitable question on the tip of
my tongue is what persuaded her to go
down the safe route. Was it a lack of
courage or parental pressure?
“It was a mixture of the two. My par-
ents liked that I played music but they
didn’t like it as a career. They saw be-
ing a singer as kind of a whorish job.
They have this idea of it being sexed
up and all that. And they would say
that my voice wasn’t good enough. My
dad’s idea of a good voice is Whitney
Houston and anything below that or
different from that isn’t good. And at
the same time I wasn’t very confident,
I was really uncomfortable with myself
when I was a teenager. If I had started
making music then, it probably would
have been a disaster. I was too dramat-
ic and emotional about everything.”
But her time studying Physics wasn’t
necessarily an unhappy period in her
life. As she tells it, she was too busy
studying and learning for things like
unhappiness. “It was like being under
the influence of some drug, I put aside
any ambition that I had. It was like be-
ing a completely different person.”
It took a long time for Valeria the
musicians to fight back against Vale-
ria the scientist. She’d had an interest
in neuroscience as a teenager and ba-
sically sleep-walked into a PhD at the
International School for Advanced
Studies in Trieste.
“During my PhD I started to get
over my lack of confidence and some-
thing started to re-emerge. I started
to become dissatisfied and I thought,
“Do I really want to become a 50-year
old professor?” But it wasn’t sudden,
when you’ve been studying for so long
it’s hard to just renounce it all. It took
another two years to make that deci-
sion. I got depressed and eventually I
just reached a threshold.”
Was there a moment I ask her? A
sudden decisive revelation?
Given that she is dubstep’s most antici-
pated female artist, with singles such
as ‘Please’ behind her and is signed
to Kode 9’s label Hyperdub, I was ea-
ger to hear Ikonika’s debut. However
even with all the excitement, it was
hard to listen to the end. The incessant
video game samples, grated on me
and left me longing for a heavier bass
line. The lack of real instrumentals
is obvious and the glitchiness of the
synths scratches at your ears. It isn’t a
complete write-off with the anthemic
‘Ikonoklast’ and Burial-esque ‘Con-
tinue?’ providing much needed relief.

Flying lotus has dubbed Cosmogram-
ma his “space opera”, and as his third
album in four years, I’m glad it’s taken
a different theme. It’s an album that
works as a whole for the devoted fan
and has singles that have wider appeal
like “...And the World Laughs with
You”, a collaboration with Thom Yorke
that mixes Flying Lotus’ trademark
deep basslines and electronics with
Yorke’s haunting vocals and “Do the
Astral Plane” which, with its clear funk
influence, will put a smile on your face
and get you at least doing your chair
dance.

“I remember what finally made me
decide. I went back to Italy for a few
weeks and I got in touch with some
musicians that I knew there and we did
a couple of sessions together and I sud-
denly realized “This is great! I want to
do this all my life.”
That was 6 years ago but Valeria isn’t
fazed by her relative lack of success,
when the compared to flash-in-the-
pan stars of mainstream pop. “I liked
the idea of success more when I was
younger. But now success scares me.
Obviously having enough money so
that you don’t have to worry is great
but success is also a cage. You can’t go
out with friends, you don’t have your
own time, so right now I’m quite happy
because I’m in control of what I’m do-

www.myspace.com/crazyforicecream
ing. My main goal isn’t success, it’s to
produce quality music that I’m happy
with and that people appreciate genu-
inely, not just because I’m in a maga-
zine but because of the music.”
It’s great to hear somebody talk about
their commitment to “the music”
without the usual garbled pretentious
twaddle that usually accompanies, but
I can’t help but take her criticism of
success with a pinch of salt. When I ask
her the age old question, “Who would
you love to perform with?” she laughs
and answers cheekily “An audience of
35,000 people.”
