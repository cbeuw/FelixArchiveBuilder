“The victory party to end all victory
parties” tore a hole through Finsbury
Park on Sunday night, as Rage Against
The Machine celebrated their unlikely,
Facebook-based Christmas chart suc-
cess in front of 65,000 people in the
biggest fuck-you ever to be aimed at
one music producer. Introduced to the
stage by a caricature of Simon Cow-
ell, complete with erect man-boobs
and surrounded by mountains of cash,
Rage smashed through a greatest hits
set to an ecstatic crowd, all of whom
had been given the tickets for free as
a thank you from the band for their
Christmas number one. Strains of
Bombtrack and Bulls On Parade could
be heard echoing across North Lon-
don, as Zack de la Rocha and friends let
the world know that they’re still here
and still angry, 18 years after their self-
titled debut album came out.
In amongst the classics and the in-
evitable politics, Rage found time
to squeeze in both a crowd-pleasing
Clash cover and, touchingly, to present
Jon and Tracy Morter, the couple who
founded the Facebook group in the
first place, and to whom Simon Cow-
ell so famously had to concede defeat
on December 20th. They appeared
on stage to accept a cheque for the
profits of the single sales for Shelter,
the charity for the homeless, and to
accept the applause of the crowd for
what probably seemed like a joke six
months ago.
Despite the anti-capitalist snarling
on-stage, Woodstock this was not. In
some regards it felt more like Read-
ing, with a choice of Carling or Car-
ling at the bar and £7 hog roast vans
galore. On the upside, this meant that
the sound and visual setup was fault-
less - even a hundred yards from the
stage, the bass was bowel-crushingly
strong and when Tom Morello played
his trademark feedback solos, every
screech and whistle screamed from the
rooftops. The predicted trouble never
materialised: although a hundred or so
people managed to force a breach in
the fence- aside from that things went
without a hitch. Hell, even the toilets
weren’t too bad.
Inevitably, the band finished with
Killing In The Name Of: introduced
by The Climb, the dreary, content-
free piano wanking that Mr Cowell
et al. had attempted to inflict on the
world back in December. Despite the
infamy, Killing In The Name Of still
isn’t Rage’s best song, but bellowed by
65,000 hoarse throats on a warm sum-
mer evening, it retains an undeniable
power, and reminded London that
every now and then, a small number of
determined people can still make a big
difference.

Australian exports are not usually
associated with the word ‘class’. You
could hardly imagine Crocodile Dun-
dee in a suit or Rolf Harris without
that happy, but slightly idiotic, look
on his face. But The Bamboos, armed
with a Blaxpoitation-era funk vibe
and Kylie Auldist’s rich, soulful vo-
cals, prove that there’s some style to
be found Down Under.
Their latest album ‘4’ (coinciden-
tally their fourth in as many years) is
a varied mix of powerful horns and
stretched syllables on “On The Sly”
and conspiratorial finger-clicking al-
leyway smoking on “You Ain’t No
Good”. I spent much of my time re-
vising for exams with the album on in
the background and it functioned like
an attentive girlfriend; quietly and
confidently helpful without distract-
ing or annoying. It’s not an explosion
of watermelons like an Animal Col-
lective album nor a continuous re-
prise of the same sound like Bombay
Bicycle Club’s debut; instead it confi-
dently explores a number of different
sounds, the most audacious of which
is a 5-minute sitar solo which sounds
better on CD than it does in print.
Despite a couple of weak tracks
- “Turn It Up” is one - the album is
a success and if my endorsement
doesn’t convince (and let’s be honest,
why would it) take heed of funk leg-
end Syl Johnson’s words “The Bam-
boos are bad mother-****ers!”

Quantic is probably one of the most
important musicians of our time. Like
the early explorers of the New World,
he returns every few months with new
found musical treasures from Central
and Southern America that delight
and astound those who care to lend
their ears. It’s not only that he is im-
measurably talented and not only that
he is impossibly prolific (although
those facts alone would identify him
amongst the most interesting artists
around today) but it’s his approach to
music that truly sets him apart. He’s a
collector who refuses to let the varied
sounds of the Americas gather dust
in hot, forgotten record stores and
an explorer constantly seeking out
new ingredients for his musical reci-
pes, working with musicians of every
conceivable background and bringing
attention to sounds as yet unheard by
Western ears.
That’s the man, the album is as ex-
pected: beautiful. I cannot claim to
write with a Pitchfork-like confidence
about the intricacies of dub and reg-
gae calypso fusion but no-one listen-
ing to “Dog With A Rope” could fail
to appreciate its quality and relaxed
complexity. You can feel the humid
rhythms of the Colombian streets,
you can almost taste the sugared rum
and to be honest, after playing this
album on repeat all evening, I barely
managed to stop myself booking the
first flight out to Bogota.

We’ve hit 170 members this week
which pretty much proves that you
can rely on Christopher Walmsley to
have at least one good idea per year.
But seriously, despite Alex’s initial,
shall we say reservations about the
last.fm group, I think it’s been a suc-
cess and Chris deserves a pat on the
back for it. So if you see him in the
sun with his shirt off, give him a nice
big ‘pat’ on the back.
Unsurprisingly my invocation to get
Barry White to No. 1 went unheeded.
In fact not a single person listened
to him. Now that I think of it, even I
didn’t bother listening to him. Oops.
In other news, apparently 6 people
in the group think it’s o.k. to listen to
Ellie Goulding... IT’S NOT.
