3D’s back baby! You ready?
Simon Worthington looks at 3D TV and what it means for you
T
he age of the red-and-blue
grainy cliché is over! Cast
aside your cheap cardboard
spectacles and make way for
a new era of unparalleled 3D realism
accompanied by spectacular picture
quality. However, instead of overpriced
cinema screenings the revolution is
going to happen right in your front
room, changing the televisions and
video games we know and love for ever.
At least, that’s what television manu-
facturers would like us to believe, as
they prepare a fresh wave of new ‘3D-
ready’ screens for release throughout
this year and next. But as with any new
technology, consumers are left with
very big questions that need answer-
ing. Where has this new 3D technol-
ogy come from? What will I need, and
how much will it cost? Is there going to
be any trouble for early adopters? Is it
really worth it?
Coca-Cola trying out the same tech-
nique for a Super Bowl commercial as
early as 1989. More recently, Channel
4’s ‘3D Week’ showed documentaries
and images of the Queen in 3D using
pairs of the classic red-and-blue card-
board glasses.
The difference this time around
however is that the television indus-
try is now focussing on ‘real 3D’ that
doesn’t distort images or ruin colours.
The current idea is to send different
television images to each eye directly
instead of filtering based on colour.
This has recently been made pos-
sible by improvements in television
and broadcast technology. There are
three main approaches being used by
manufacturers referred to as ‘passive
3D’, ‘active 3D’ and ‘auto-stereoscopic
viewing’.
are likely to set you back only
around £5-10 a pair. The
downside is a reduc-
tion in brightness
and around about
30% colour loss.
Alternatively
you have active
3D, also referred
to as ‘alternate
frame sequencing’,
which uses a more
high-tech set of glasses
to create the 3D effect.
Each pair of glasses has a
liquid crystal display in-
stead of a lens that, when a
voltage is applied across it,
turns dark and opaque (us-
ing the same idea as display-
ing numbers on a digital
watch). Pairs of glasses are
synchronised via infra-red
or RF to the television that
tells the glasses which eye
should be open and closed
at any one time. This cre-
ates the desired 3D effect
by ensuring individual
frames can be sent to in-
dividual eyes. Active shut-
ter technology is by far the
most popular choice with
almost every major TV manufacturer
having a device in the marketplace us-
ing this technology meaning it’s set to
become the standard in some form for
3D viewing. Both glasses and screens
are quite expensive however, coming
in at around £2000 for a 46” TV and
£60-100 for each pair of glasses.
B
am! The World Cup is here!
Yes, footballers from around
the world are set to do bat-
tle on the International stage.
But wait, how can you get all World
Cup all the time? The Beeb and ITV
will be doing an outstanding job I’m
sure, covering all angles on the TV, but
what about when you’re on the bus?
TVcatchup.com is your best bet for
live streaming. It’ll stream to your old
and busted, or new and shiny iPhone
no problem, even over 3G, so you’ll
never miss a goal.
Can’t watch something, but still want
more? Well good, old fashioned radio
is your next best bet. Radio 5 Live will
be covering most of the games, leaving
your hands free to do other things.
Last but not least, there’s the World
Cup apps; loads of em, for all smart-
phone platforms, so check them out.

to read them. An interesting point is
that these discs can actually be used
on a standard 2D Blu-ray player with-
out issue, so it may be prudent to start
buying new Blu-ray films in 3D as an
investment for the three dimensional
future.

Most of us will now be pretty familiar
with the idea of watching 3D movies in
acinemawithmanynotablefilmspush-
ing beyond the use of 3D as a novelty
effect and instead using the technology
in a much more integral way. With the
box office success of films like Avatar,
which was shown in both IMAX 3D
and in regular cinema 3D, television
manufacturers are now bringing to
market all their 3D prototypes to try
and cash in on increased interest in
viewing in the third dimension. In fact,
3D television is not a new concept with
broadcasters like the BBC transmitting
3D specials of Doctor Who in 1993 and

Most of you will be at least be famil-
iar with passive 3D, which is the same
system that is used in cinemas. The
television display is ‘polarised’, only
emitting light in a specific way, with
viewers having to wear a set of glasses
whose lenses have also been ‘polarised’.
Polarisation is changed on each suc-
cessive frame and when viewing the
programme through the glasses each
frame is only seen by one eye. Hard-
ware manufacturer LG has announced
at least one display (the LD950) that
will use this approach. A lower price is
the primary benefit of this system, with
sets costing up to £200 less than the
other methods in use. The 3D glasses
required are also relatively cheap and
Auto-whatnow?
Auto-whatnow?
If the prospect of donning an oversized
set of specs is worrying you, auto-ster-
eoscopic displays may have the answer.
These sets don’t require any kind of ac-
cessory for the user to wear, instead us-
ing a lenticular sheet, or parallax bar-
rier, to show the image across multiple
viewing angles. With enough different
angles each eye will receive a different
picture and so observe a 3D effect.
Auto-stereoscopic technology also
holds the possibility of allowing view-
ers to quite literally tilt their head to
see behind an object on the screen, us-
ing a sufficiently large amount of data
to present different images at different
angles. However, the effect can cause a
loss of picture quality and isn’t as no-
ticeable as the other methods.
Phillips used this effect in their
WOWvx product line as early as two
years ago, but they have since dropped
the range stating that they ‘didn’t want
to enter a format war’ over 3D tech-
nology standards. Most of the current
offerings are aimed at advertisers, al-
though the technology does seem to
be gaining use on portable devices. Hi-
tachi will soon be the first to release a
3D phone screen in Japan, whilst Nin-
tendo announced that the next version
of their popular hand-held games con-
sole, the Nintendo 3DS (see what they
did there?), will use the effect.

As may be evident, there is currently
a lack of consensus in the television
industry as to which implementation
of 3D TV viewing is best. Thankfully,
Sky TV have already announced their
3D Sky+ box will work on all displays
without worry. At the moment though,
each manufacturer has it’s own pro-
prietary system for controlling glasses
and polarisation. Not only may this
lead to another format war of some
kind (anyone remember HD-DVDs?),
which is bad news for early adopters,
but it’s also frustrating for consum-
ers as it means glasses from different
companies aren’t compatible with each
other.
The glasses issue is also a sticky sub-
ject. Right since it’s first broadcast,
watching television has been a social
experience with as many people able
to watch as can be fit into the room. It
may be the case however, that 3D TV
is set to mess with this stereotype re-
quiring every viewer to adorn glasses,
which in large families could get very
expensive very quickly. It also raises
questions over watching with friends,
as anyone without a pair of glasses can’t
take part in the 3D experience. Lack of
standards for glasses also means that
even friends with their own glasses
could only watch if they have the same
model of TV, or in some cases wear the
glasses upside down.

To get a full 3D experience for films in
the home you’ll also need a new Blu-
ray player. Normal discs aren’t set up
in the right way to handle 3D content
and so there has recently been the in-
troduction of 3D Blu-ray discs, which
require a compatible 3D Blu-ray player

Even after shelling out for your new
television, new glasses, new Blu-ray
player and new Sky+ box, you may
still struggle to actually watch any 3D
content at all. Although Sky have now
launched their dedicated 3D channel
they have said that it was a ‘difficult’
process, mainly due to a ‘lack of 3D
content’. The fact is that apart from a
few films (be prepared to watch Mon-
sters Vs. Aliens a lot) and a smattering
of 3D channels that tend to show live
sport, there isn’t actually all that much
available to watch in 3D. Making 3D
programming is still a difficult process.
Studios need to upgrade nearly all of
their equipment if they want to make
3D shows, and so it will probably still
be a long time before there is signifi-
cant quantity of things to watch using
your new 3D television.
Given the high set-up costs, lack of
programming and the possible de-
struction of what little social interac-
tion families have left, it’s hard to see
why anyone would want to bother with
3D television. Certainly, for the aver-
age consumer the time has probably
not yet come, to make the change to
3D, but early adopters will be suitably
impressed by the ‘wow’ factor that 3D
brings. In time, all TVs will support 3D
naturally, like nearly all new displays
support HD now. With this in mind, a
three-dimensional television could be
a sound investment. At any rate, the
message from the television industry is
clear: 3D TV is here to stay.
