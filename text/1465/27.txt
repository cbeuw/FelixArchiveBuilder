Well. Brilliant. No answers last week.
So this is worth 50 points this week.
Not updating the solution to last
week’s as you can still send it in for
points. It’s like a rollover.
There’s still loads of copies here in felix
office or about campus.

Heroine-o-scopes: Horoscopes hits the hard stuff
Come on, stop holding out on me! I need my fix, man! Aw, yeah, gimme me some of that Jane Eyre
Cancer
It’sthefinalexam...and
you know nothing!
To cheat your way
out, you make eyes
with the invigilator
and perform some
very suggestive hand-
gestures. The invigilator interprets this display
as a stroke and has you removed for medical
attention. Score! Unfortunately, you missed
the deadline for mitigating circumstances.
Distraught, you have a heart attack – and still fail.
Virgo
After a vigorous
session in the pool,
you decide to chillax
in the jacuzzi. Mm, the
bubbles feel so good on
your bare skin, almost
sexual. You sit up and
look around. It’s late and no-one’s around. You
slip off your trunks and slip your cock into one of
the jet streams. It feels so divine, you melt. When
you’ve finished you resemble a cocktail sausage.
Gemini
You want to be a man
but lifting weights is
too hard and an over-
active gag reflex pre-
vents you from down-
ing pints. Instead, you
decide to grow a moustache. With time, it grows
from peach fuzz to a full soup-strainer. But girls
like big men and drunk men but not hairy men.
Realising your mistake, you burn the moustache.
Probably should have shaved it off first though.
Pisces
Aw, man, the drum-
bass on this song is
wicked! You should be
revising but the music
is just too good. You
start tapping along
on the desk but it
doesn’t have the same pounding effect. You grab
whatever you can find to make a better sound.
A conveniently placed hammer does the job...for
five seconds, before you destroy the desk – and
your kneecaps.
Leo
After buying a ticket
on a whim, you win the
lottery. £100 million!
Then you receive your
results. You pass! Firsts
in everything, even
subjects you didn’t take!
Later, Cheryl Cole finally returns your calls and
asks you out for dinner. Your life is perfect. See?
There are nice horoscopes too. Then your parents
ring up – you were adopted. Turns out your real
parents are Piers Morgan and Susan Boyle.
Aries
After a long, long day,
you’re tired. The train
is hot & stuffy and the
sound of the wheels is
hypnotic.Youdozeoff.
When you wake up,
the train has stopped
& Chaos reigns. Cars on fire, shop-fronts smashed
in, gangs in all-out war on the streets. Like H.G.
Wells’ time-traveller, you’ve arrived at a barbaric,
dystopian future. The horror! Then you realise
that you’re in Watford. Oh, that’s alright then.
Scorpio
Ugh, the fridge smells
pretty funky. The cause:
the bread is blanketed in
mould. You’re about to
throw it out when it says,
“Stop! I have become
conscious. You must
let me live!” Touched by its plea, you close the bin.
Instead, you make a toasted cheese sandwich. The
mould swears revenge. You eat it anyway but your
stomach curls up and dies in agony just as the police
burst in and arrest you for fungicide. Checkmate!
Libra
It’s late and you’re
hunting for breakfast
cereal to snack on. The
cornflakes have run out
but there’s still some
weetabix. You grab one
& munch away. Within
seconds, the biscuit has turned to cement in your
mouth. Chewing is impossible as your jaw glues
shut. Wait, did weetabix always come as a grey
powder in a big bag with a blue circle on it? When
you realise your error, you’ll shit bricks.
Taurus
Instead of writing
the horoscopes, you
browse the diction-
ary for dirty words. If
you flick through fast
enough, it begins to
read like a dirty book.
You find yourself titillated (v.) so in order to “take
out the book,” you move one hand from the dic-
tionary to your pants. In doing so, you drop the
dictionary on your cock. It falls open on “Pancake
(n): A flattened penis. Now stop wanking on me.”
Capricorn
For a laugh, you penny
your mate’s drink. He
retaliates by dropping
all his loose change in
your pint. Dutifully, you
down it, making sure to
catch all the metal. But
one slips past and you swallow a 5-pence piece. You
start to gag and after laughing hysterically, your
friends rush you to hospital. When they pump your
stomach, two 2-pences come up. Dammit, you hate
it when they short-change you...pint?
Aquarius
Nothing beats curling
up with a good book.
After bombing an
exam, you buy a copy
of War and Peace
from behind Blackett
and fetch the needle,
lighter and spoon. Hm, hefty tome – you switch
to a soup ladle. In the morning, your friends find
you foaming at the mouth with lethal amounts
of Russian literature in your blood.

Sagittarius
Desperate for cash, you
become a sperm donor.
You’re feeling quite
anxious but they’ve
provided you with some
“gentleman’s literature”
to set you at ease. You
have a flick through and get it going easily enough.
Something’s bothering you though; all the photos
look somehow familiar. Too late, recognition kicks
in. You’ve just come all over your family album.
Your baby photos are surprisingly arousing.
