Scribble box Wordoku is identical to Sudoku; we’ve
just replaced numbers with letters.
Complete the puzzle and then send the
whole grid to sudoku.felix@imperial.
ac.uk. You will not get credit for just
the word alone. It’s not an anagram.
How to rate yourself:
Under 9 words: The wheel may be spin-
ning but your gerbil has died. Lets hope
you get a brain for Christmas.
10 – 14 words: You are so dense that light
bends around you.
15 – 20 words: You’re not as stupid as you
look, are you?
21 plus words: Well done, you linguistic
leviathon! Merry Juney Christmas!
How to play
Using the letters given, not more than
once, make as many words as possible.
They must be at least four or more let-
ters long and each word you come up with
must include the central letter. Capitalised
words, conjugated verbs (past tense etc),
adverbs ending in “-ly”, comparatives and
superlatives are disallowed. A word you
are not allowed in this case would be “Fe-
lix” as none of the letters can be found in
the polygon. I think you know the rules by
now.
