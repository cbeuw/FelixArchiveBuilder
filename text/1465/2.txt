Imperial College Union have an-
nounced the recipients of the Union’s
annual awards.
During the last Council of term, held
this past Monday, Union President
Ashley Brown announced the Union
Colours awardees alongside this year’s
President’s Awards.
Out of 104 nominations made, 78
individuals were deemed to have been
deserving of Union Colours.
The accolades are graded from Half
Colours (the individual must have made
a “positive contribution to the general
life of the Union in an extraordinary
fashion”) up to Fellowship (awardee has
“continuously served the Union in an
exceptional manner.”)
The President’s Awards (detailed
below) are annual honours personally
chosen by the President as his tenure
comes to an end. One club or society is
also chosen.
Brown said of Women in Science, En-
gineering and Technology (SET):
“The club has been amazing over the
past couple of years which included two
photo exhbitions: “100 Women, 100
Visions” at City Hall and “We.Are.Sci-
ence”, in College’s main entrance”.

Not quite the fiasco
we had hoped for
W
hen panic ensues
in the Union, it’s
always worth my
while waiting out
the situation. On
several occasions this year, we at fe-
lix have caught wind of a potential
and imminent fiasco unfolding in the
Union’s offices. They make good news
stories, naturally.
Probing for the particulars can only
get a journalist so far, and sometimes
sitting tight and observing the events
uncovers how big a story actually is.
It was no different this week. On
Friday afternoon, we had a rather
sweaty Deputy President (who shall
remain unnamed *cough*Danny
Hill*cough*) enquire about extra ad-
vertising for the Summer Ball. He was
a bit too keen for comfort, and it was
obvious sales spreadsheets were look-
ing a bit bare upstairs. Headlines were
swinging past our eyes: ‘Summer ball
bombing’, or ‘Summer Balls up.”
Ticket sales weren’t looking brilliant.
Come Monday evening however,
both aforementioned Deputy Presi-
dent and President looked distinctly
happier when the subject of ticket
sales resurfaced at the last Council
meeting of the year.
Checking the figures straight after,
200 tickets had been sold over the
weekend and sales figures were appar-
ently back on track when compared to
last year’s sales patterns. Panic over
for the Union, story in the bin for felix.
At the time of writing, the event still
needs around 650 tickets to reach last
year’s attendance. The Union are hope-
ful that these tickets will be sold by the
19th of June, the night of the Ball.
I’m not entirely sure why ticket sales
have been on the slow side. From what
is on offer, I would have thought tick-
ets would have been snapped up very
quickly, but evidently not.
Are the Union doing things right?
Danny Hill, Deputy President (Fi-
nance & Services), who is responsible
for organising this ball, has gone for
what he describes “a festival vibe”.
There are less DJs and more live
acts. Instead of one headliner like
last year, there are three. Athlete,
quite frankly a band with a reputa-
tion plummeting by the minute, cost
the Union £8,000 to book. This year,
the Union have spent less on the din-
ner part of the evening, as well as in-
creasing entry prices, and have used
nearly a third of a £110,000 budget on
three up-and-coming headline acts
in Tinie Tempah (he has two recent
UK No.1s), Noisettes (listen to ‘Never
Forget You’ and you’ll know them)
and Plan B (currently in the top ten of
the UK album charts).
Regarding the price, I’ll admit that
£90 for a dinner ticket is a bit much.
I wouldn’t pay for it. £45 for a enter-
tainments ticket seems just about rea-
sonable, albeit pushing ‘expensive’ for
the acts, plus the funfair and general
happenings until the next morning.
A question that organisers ask every
year is whether the Ball can be sus-
tained for the following summer. As
students, we all want a final send-off
for our friends. Some of them you’ll
see after the summer break, but some
of them you might never see again.
It’d be a great shame for everyone, but
especially a graduating year, if they
were stripped of a Summer Ball.
Being a Biologist, I’ve never been to
a Summer Ball. Maybe my optimism
is yet to be quashed in a devastating
way.
I’m a traditional critic of the Union,
and you’d guess so since I’m the Editor
of felix, but I’ve got faith.
I just want to say goodbye to my
graduating friends, get horrendously
hammered and end the night in my
own vomit. Why not do it in a tuxedo
and on a dodgem car?
