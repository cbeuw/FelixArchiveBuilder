Blair’s 50% targets scrapped as Higher Ed gets revamp
L
iberal Democrat business
secretary Vince Cable has
opted for a revamp of Fur-
ther and Higher Education,
resulting in the government
considering cutting the amount of stu-
dents going to University. Tony Blair
and the previous government had a
target of putting 50% of young people
through University, but Cable remains
sceptical that increasing the number
of students is a good thing.
Adding actual cuts to University
places after the coalition’s move to
fund 10,000 fewer places than prom-
ised under Labour (as reported on by
felix last week) will fuel more anger
from critics, students and staff alike.
The Guardian reports a source close
to Cable said that “there needs to be
a big national debate between excel-
lence and quality on the one hand
and bums on seats on the other hand.
Packing more and more students in is
not necessarily good value for money.’’
Aaron Porter, president of the Na-
tional Union of Students, has ex-
pressed his concerns that this move
would ‘’jeopardise the fragile eco-
nomic recovery and place us at risk of
returning to a Higher Education sys-
tem accessible only to a liberal elite.’’
There appears to be much agreement
with this view, with France and the
US investing more in their Universi-
ties. Sally Hunt, general secretary of
the University and College Union ap-
proved of the idea of a debate on the
future of Universities, but slammed
Britain’s chances in the “global knowl-
edge economy’’ if funding or student
participation continues to reduce,
stating that she “cannot see how deny-
ing thousands the chance to fulfil their
potential at university and increas-
ing the strain on the benefits system
would be in this country’s interest’’.
With both parties of the coalition
government appearing to find the
current system unsustainable, ma-
jor overhauls are expected. Cable
is strongly aligned towards putting
more money into vocational train-
ing and Further Education in order to
break down the perceived elitism of
University education. In times where
students, the general public and em-
ployers alike may compare degrees
from one University with another, the
question that remains to be asked is
the extent of disruption which may
occur if the degree classification sys-
tem was changed. Several months ago,
felix ran a story discussing whether a

Letters to
the Editor
Dan Wan,
I am writing to express the disgust I felt when I
read Twatter this week (4th June 2010) . Normally
I enjoy the mindless humour however I found this
particularly distasteful. As I am originally from
Cumbria the shooting referred to in this column is
something I am particularly sensitive about. I per-
sonally feel that there is a fine line between dark
humour and distasteful and here a line has been
crossed.
As editor I think it is your responsibility to be
aware of where this line is and what may offend
students reading your paper. Surely it must have
occurred to you that some students may even
be from Whitehaven, or Agremont or any of the
many other communities that has been shocked
by the horrific events that occurred just two days
before the “jokes” about these were published in
our paper.
To add insult to injury you clearly didn’t deem
the event as important enough to feature in any
‘news’ section of the paper , I can’t help but ques-
Twatter crossed a dark line tion an editor who deems it enough to put two
lines of sarcastic jokes about a cereal killing but
neglects to write it as any sort of news.
Ruth Patchett
Editor-in-Chief Dan Wan responds:
I can only apologise for any upset we have caused
with last week’s issue. We obviously do not intend
to offend anyone, and you rightly say there is a fine
line between satire, dark humour and just plain
distasteful. I will admit that last week’s Twatter
straddles that line, and is a result of a misjudgment
on where exactly the joke lay.
Regarding the lack of mention in the News sec-
tion, this section tend to focus on matters surround-
ing Imperial College. Every week, there are national
and international occurrences. Unfortunately we
cannot provide coverage to it all. I hope you can
understand that the unfortunate events that un-
folded in Cumbria last week would probably have
not been covered in a paper with such a select target
audience.
I hope you can accept our apologies.
degree from Imperial is more attrac-
tive to employers. Roger Brown, pro-
fessor of the Higher Education policy
at Liverpool Hope has since recom-
mended scrapping the 200 year old
tradition of awarding firsts, 2:1s and
2:2s due to the classifications prolong-
ing ‘’the pretence that a degree from
one university can be compared with
one from another university.’’
The Comparability Of Degree
Standards report warns that it is
“impossible’’ to compare one Univer-
sity with another. As pressures mount
from the £1.2billion cuts from Univer-
sity budgets up until 2013, the report
argues that there is a risk that they are
more likely to “cut corners’’, mention-
ing that Universities would be less
likely to award students higher marks
than deserved if classifications were
dropped. Brown suggested the alter-
native of awarding transcripts and a
general statement of students’ abili-
ties, a system currently being trialled
in some Universities.
Brown continued to explain that “at
the moment, if a University decides it
is going to change the rules, there is
no mechanism that would alert any-
one to this. We urgently need to look
at this’’, further suggesting that panels
of academics can
be sent to deduce
whether the content
of courses and the
quality of teaching
are up to minimum
standards. An in-
ternal E-mail from
Manchester Metropolitan University
was leaked two years ago showing
their staff being urged to increase the
amount of top marks in order to re-
main in good competition with rival
Universities. Some high profile cases
have arisen since, including Universi-
ties such as Bournemouth. At present,
Imperial targets 70% of students
reaching a 2:1 or better, but only 57%
have done so. In Mathematics BSc/
MSc, only 21% of graduates achieved
a first class degree, with 36% reaching
a 2:1.
felix previously reported on the “2:1
floor’’ which appears to be unani-
mously adopted by employers, where
2:1 degrees are considered preliminary
requirements for securing employ-
ment. Should the government pro-
ceed with not only their overhauls, but
also adopt reclassification of degrees
or removal of the current system, the
“2:1 floor’’ would essentially be lifted,
granting students more perceived se-
curity in graduate prospects after Uni-
versity. This may result in more stu-
dents applying and the dissolution of
the elitist image of Higher Education.
The prior felix article invited com-
ments arguing for the respectability
of 2:2 class degrees and their poten-
tial academic equivalence to “at least
a 2:1 from many institutions’’, further
describing Imperial’s unwavering
opposition to the “degree inflation
phenomenon.’’
Brown’s report, however, argues the
further impossibility of comparing
degrees from Oxbridge to other Uni-
versities due to “the extraordinarily
high previous educational attainment
of students, the substantially greater
resources devoted to them, the greater
intensity of study that they undergo,
and other factors’’, further adding that
“it would in fact be a surprise if the
outcomes of students from those uni-
versities were no higher than those of
students from other universities who
have far lower prior attainment and
resources devoted to them.’’
Director general of the Russell
Group, Dr Wendy Piatt, commented
that their priority was to “ensure the
quality of Higher Education was main-
tained, rather than expanding num-
bers’’ and added that they “would be
concerned about any proposals which
fail to address the problem of under
funding of teaching for home students
in the UK’’.
