rap. Whassup homeies? How
is the big SK ghetto? Yeah, I
wasn’t actually doing exams,
I was attending a course on
‘street slang and wide-boy chat. Innit’
Went alright actually got a D, so I was
picked on by most of the class for being
‘like fecking Heinstine’. Whatever that
means, I chose not to correct them,
they carry knives. Or so I’ve heard.
Actually I lie. I was taking my finals.
Unfortunately I got kicked out of one.
Apparently there is a difference be-
tween the phrase ‘I wanked all over
that’ and actually doing it. It wasn’t re-
ally my fault, I was just writing about
the problems of wetting and subse-
quent deep penetration and impreg-
nation of slags and kinda got carried
away. Ladies, we study in a male domi-
nated environment, deal with it.
Actually I lie. But I did write about
slags though. Honestly who wouldn’t
given the chance? Who decided to
write a scientific paper on copper na-
notubes and to make life easier abbre-
viate it to CuNT throughout the entire
prose? Similarly who named a certain
type of crack a ‘cleavage crack’? And
my personal favourite, a phase in low
carbon steel, Fe3
C. Or to his mates, Ce-
mentite. Yes that is a word which has
both semen and tit as constitutent syl-
labils. Amazing.
Enough sillyness. I’ve read that pubs
are still closing at about a rate of six per
day. That’s a lot of pubs, and nobody
likes to see a pub with closed doors.
It’s been put down to a combination
of supermarket cheap alcohol, allow-
ing people to get wankered at home,
and the... yes, recession. England has
a particularly forceful drinking cul-
ture, mainly down to the food and shit
weather. Give us a ray of sun and we’ve
half naked in a pub, drinking. That’s
just how we roll. The pub is where we
meet to chat and socialise. Your mate’s
flat might have an x-box, but the pub
has more beer, a bigger TV and some-
times, hookers. Or all the time if you
drink in Croydon.
But it’s not all doom and gloom. At
the moment it’s only the shit ones that
are closing, and, well, generally you
don’t like to drink in shit pubs. But
soon it’ll be the ok ones, and then the
ones you actually like to drink in. The
ones which don’t have a condom ma-
chine in the toilets.
Wordpath 1,465
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORDS -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW-> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS)
would be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

Slitherlink 1,465
So it appears that after demanding to
get a Slitherlink back as the Puzzle
Commadore’s Nonolinks were too
crazy you choose not to do them. Now,
this is beyond a joke, please get it done
for the final issue of the year next week.
As a result I have put the same one in
again this week and offered DOUBLE
points to those that send in correct an-
swers. Although this will still remain to
be zero and once again I will have wast-
ed my time. Ah well it could be worse,
I could be in Iraq, or Croydon. I dis-
like Croyden, full of chavs and hookers.
And chavvy hookers.

“I want to lick you out library girl in
red top second floor. ”
A bit weird
“No really I actually do, and I’ve
quite a long tongue. ”
Still a bit weird
“Seriously, I can get to every nook
and cranny you want. ”
Mate, that’s enough
“I’m sick and tired of you. First you
punched your friend, then you made
a mess of the dancefloor and not in
the good way. Wake up and smell
your foreskin!”
Seriously? Did you shit in the bar?
“Hey, Alrac. We went back together
last week. I was hammed, sorry
about the floppy. I didn’t get your
number, but hopefully if you’re
reading this you’ll get mine. ”
