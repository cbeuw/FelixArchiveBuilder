22 reasons to give up and impale yourself
Please don’t actually impale yourself. Unless it’s with a really small spear. Or a splinter. Quite a small splinter
Barack_attack_l33thaxor
And he got arrested for pissin on a mosque.
Apparently he was wasted and thought it was a
church. Not been Osie’s week
I
t’s the penultimate issue so
I’ve only got two weeks left to
srpead my sandwich of misan-
thropy with layer upon layer
of contempt for my fellow stu-
dents. Now I’ve been avoiding doing a
page on this issue for the whole year,
just because it seemed to obvious a
subject to tackle, but hopefully you’ll
read this and realise that I want you to
shut up and leave me alone.
“There aren’t
enough girls; I’m
so depressed.”
So you don’t have a girlfriend because
of the gender ratio. Here is a list of oth-
er possible reasons for you not having
a girlfriend:
1 - You’re insanely boring and tedious
and drain life from others around you
2 - You’re fat and ugly and you don’t
have a personality to compensate. (Or
you’re too fat and ugly for personality
to even come into the equation)
3 - You think that incessant talking
makes you interesting
4 - You spend more time on World of
Warcraft than RL (If you don’t know
what RL stands for then this most like-
ly doesn’t apply to you)
5 - You smell. Take a shower. No se-
riously, it’s not even funny. You intro-
duced me to my gag reflex.
6 - You wear black tank tops with
SLAYER scrawled in a red bloody font
across the front. Baggy black jeans
with metal dangly bits, long greasy
hair - OK I GET IT! YOU LIKE MET-
AL MUSIC! CONGRATULATIONS!
It doesn’t mean that you don’t have to
dress like a fucking dick
7 - You relate everything to some
Family Guy episode you’ve seen and
then quote it
8 - You can’t dance. You do that thing
where you sort of just jog on the spot
and then enthusiastically mouth along
to the lyrics to ensure that everyone
in the club can see that you know the
words.
9 - You mix up ‘your’ and ‘you’re’. I’m
not a girl, but if I were and some guy
whispered in my ear, ‘Your a filthy slut’,
I’d spit in his face and say, ‘I maybe a
filthy slut, but I would NEVER misuse
the possessive pronoun.’
THE NEWS WITHOUT THE NEWS
Cameron_DA_Maneron!!!
The guy’s a liability. Dyu remember the tiem
wen he was drivin us to Bristol and he ran over
that wheelchair person?
SUPERACEGORTHEROAR87
Osie’s been banned from Twatter for an insen-
sitive joke
10 - You talk about ‘being drunk’ as
if it’s in the same league as base jump-
ing. ‘Man you should have checked me
out last night - I was drunk.’ ‘NOWAY!
You were drunk? You drank alcohol?
Are you some sort of rock star? You
can’t just go around drinking alcohol,
that shit is dangerous! I honestly can’t
believe you were drunk. I’m going to
text all my friends. Can I have a photo
with you? It’s going to be my facebook
profile picture’
11 - You’re too short. Nothing you
can do about that. No-one is ever go-
ing to love you
12 - You listen to bands that no-one
has ever heard of, just for the sake of
listening to bands that no-one has
ever heard of. You’re the same person
that uses ridiculously ecoteric musical
categories like ‘Neopagan symphonic
minimal techno’. You’ve never heard
of Neopagan symphonic minimal
techno? I guess you’re into your main-
stream techno. I hate mainstream mu-
sic because it’s mainstream
13 - You read the financial times
and talk about the economy. (Refer to
number 1)
14 - You try to make a philosophical
dilemma out of every fucking state-
ment, “You want a cup of tea?”
“Do I want a cup of tea? Or does the
cup of tea simply need me to want it?”
....“What? That doesn’t even make any
sense.”
“How would one go about mak-
ing sense? Is sense a tangible object
that one can make? Perhaps sense
can only be made if everything else is
non-sensical.”
“I hate you so much.”
“Or perhaps I hate you. Or you hate
yourself. Or perhaps the tea hates us
both! OH SHIT, THE TEA! It’s so non-
sensical that it makes sense! We’ve got
to run. RUUUUUN!....Oh my God!
ARRGHH The tea, its got my leg, AR-
RGGHHH... there’s so much blood
- Oh my god its eating my intestines
- ARRGHGH...this is horrible...this is
the most painful thing that’s ever hap-
pened to me...SAVE YOURSELF! It’s
too late for me, but you should know
that I - I - I, you need to know that I
- ........ ”
You’re also the sort of twat who dies
before revealing a long-kept secret.
15 - You listen to the girl’s really in-
teresting story about how she...er....
um...something about handbags?....Oh
I’m sorry, I was imagining this thing
about tea, but took the scenario WAY
too far in my head. I don’t know if it
would be worse to be killed by a cup
of tea, or just a teabag. A teabag with
pointy teeth and little hands. HAHA-
HAHAHAHA, a teabag with little
hands. I want a pet teabag with little
hands; I’d call him Rodney and I’d feed
him museli. But he doesn’t even like
museli. He like’s Alpen, but that’s tech-
nically not museli. Ohhh Rodney
16 - You treat women like objects.
They’re 65% Oxygen, 18% carbon, 10%
Hydrogen, 3% Nitrogen, 1.5% calcium,
1.2% phosphorous, 0.2% Potassium,
0.2% Sulphur, 0.2% Chlorine, 0.1% so-
dium, 0.05% magnesium, 2.3 grams of
iron and a bit of Copper, Zinc, Cobalt,
Iodine, Selenium and Fluorine. There’s
so much more to them than you think
17- You don’t shave. And there are
only two people that don’t shave; Santa
and paedophiles. Oh shit and Jesus.
Sorry Jesus. I don’t know if Muham-
mad had a beard, but I’m too scared
to ask. We’ll play it safe and assume he
had a moustache. Moustaches are cool
18 - You don’t have a moustache.
19 - You’re gay. Although they’ve
probably still done more with a girl
than you.
20 - You’re depressed. You think
that everyone feels sorry for you be-
cause you’re ill. You’re not ill, you’re
just a bit sad and you told the doctor
you’re a bit sad and the doctor said,
‘yep you’re a bit sad, now go forth and
ruin everyone’s party’. I’m using party
as a metaphor for when you’re not
around, because it feels like a party.
Everyone’s depressed - I’m depressed,
but like cool-depressed. I smoke in the
rain and weep gently to Eric Clapton.
The real art is the gentle weeping. One
small tear down the left cheek - perfec-
tion. One more tear and you’ve ruined
everything, well done. You can’t even
be depressed properly - you’re useless
21 - You talk about your course
22 - You’re on the football team. But
wait a second? You guys sleep with
girls all the time right? Well I say girls,
but they’re more like STI vending ma-
chines. The ones that will give you what
you want, so long as you give them a
good punching. I guess, as an excep-
tion to rule 16, they really are objects.
Saying “Pussy is Pussy” is all very well,
but then you have to ask if some gaping
chasm of sagging weathered skin that
resembles a disembowled stomach re-
ally is a pussy anymore.
But the reason you’re not getting a girl
is not because you’re an awkward, in-
tolerable self-absorbed c**t, it’s clearly
because of the gender ratio. Now shut
up, stop going on about it and fuck off
back to your room and masturbate to
Neopagan interpretive frog porn.

lol yeah, we wer all liek ‘Shiiiiiiiit’ and Osie al-
ready had 9 points on his licence so he drove
off. Classic Osie hit and run. it was quite funny
Barack_attack_l33thaxor
to be fair he was wearin sunglasses and it was
night and he had just done centurion challenge.
So he takes his jokes a little too far, ppl should
giv him a break coz he’s got a good heart.
