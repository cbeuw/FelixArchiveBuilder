BUSA cup quarter finals
Saturday 13th February s a w t h e m e d i c s
2nd XV b r e a k i n g n e w barriers for t h e
club by beating Newcastle 1 8 - 1 2 a w a y
to earn a place in t h e last 8 o f the BUSA
2nd XV c u p c o m p e t i t i o n .
Having c o m e 2 n d in t h e Southern
Premiership, a n d therefore g a i n e d a bye
into t h e last 16 o f t h e c u p , t h e 2 n d XV
had not played a n y student rugby since
before Christmas, with the only g a m e s o f
'99 being p u n c h i n g matches with fat, o l d
m e n ! However, true to m e d i c s tradition,
the g a m e w a s played with guts f o u n d e d
o n the pride that is held in t h e club a n d
in the medical school.
In t h e first half t h e m e d i c s h a d t h e
advantage o f a slight slope, a n d after
d o m i n a t i n g N e w c a s t l e ' s m u c h larger
pack for t h e first 15 minutes, a brief lack
o f concentration in t h e m e d i c s d e f e n c e
allowed Newcastle to break free, a mis-
take w h i c h eventually cost t h e m e d i c s a
converted penalty try. N o t to be out-
d o n e , t h e m e d i c s r e s p o n d e d quickly
with a fantastic try f r o m 1 st year Rob Jeffs,
and w h e n t h e half t i m e whistle b l e w
the medics w e r e 5 - 7 d o w n .
The m e d i c s pack started t h e s e c o n d
half w i t h o u t t h e s a m e ferocity a n d
bloody m i n d e d n e s s In t h e ruck a n d t h e
maul that they had s h o w n in the first half
and it w a s not l o n g before t h e N e w c a s -
tle pack p u s h e d t h e m e d i c s back over
their line to increase their lead to 5 -12.
The f o l l o w i n g 15 minutes s a w 3 penalty
kicks at goal. T w o w e r e by t h e medics
n u m b e r 10, Louis G r a n d j e a n , w h i c h
sailed cleanly through the posts, fortu-
nately t h e Newcastle kicker did not have
the s a m e fortune.
With 10 m i n u t e s r e m a i n i n g N e w -
castle had a 1 point advantage, but in the
closing minutes the medics d u g d e e p .
They w e r e justly rewarded w h e n Nick
Enzel cut back o n a d u m m y , before pass-
ing to Si Jones w h o broke away d o w n the
line, a n d having c o m m i t t e d the N e w -
castle full back, gave a try scoring pass
to Jim Fielding. Lois Grandjean converted.

N e v e r b e f o r e h a s a m e d i c s side
reached t h e last 8 in the BUSA c u p c o m -
petition, but it has finally h a p p e n e d , not
through having the better individuals, but

RIDING
First ever championship sees Imperial
Riding placed fourth
The Riding team is a n e w team for Impe-
rial. For t h e first t i m e ever w e w e n t o u t
as a team in four regional competitions.
The competitions entail both s h o w j u m p -
ing (at three foot) a n d dressage disci-
plines. Unfortunately w e w e r e picked to
be in BUSA groups that had s o m e o f the
best teams in t h e country. N o n e t h e l e s s
w e have not b e e n disheartened as it
was a g o o d effort from all a n d brilliant
fun.
The first s h o w w a s o n Royal Vets
g r o u n d near Watford. The dressage did-
n't g o too well d u e to our nerves - how-
ever w e trashed the other teams in t h e
j u m p i n g , with three clears a n d o n e
refusal. Lucy (the horse intimidator) took
o n t h e horse that h a d d u m p e d t h e
demonstrator. Cathy w e n t r o u n d at
90mph, got a clear round, but at the e n d
the steering went a bit w r o n g and e n d e d
up leaving with s o m e f e n c e w o r k still
attached. Rachel w a s brilliant, but w e
w e r e worried w h e n she had a disagree-
m e n t with t h e horse in m i d air.
W e e k two saw us hosting our o w n
s h o w at the Belmont riding centre. This
time the dressage w a s fantastic, s e e i n g
D i a n a in s e c o n d place. The j u m p i n g ,
however, w a s a disaster. Kathy as usual
had a clear r o u n d - n o problems there.
Diana then clocked up an impressive 30
penalty points. Rachel h a d a n unlucky
k n o c k d o w n , while t h e other Rachel had
to be carted o f f after b e i n g m a u l e d by a
wild p o n y monster.
The positions for the third s h o w were
starting to get a bit tight. It w a s time to
put o n a g o o d s h o w at UCL. Unfortu-
nately Kathy w a s put o n a n express train
for the dressage. Rachel injured her leg
and forgot t h e test half w a y through. As
it always g o e s , y o u c a n never have it
both ways. W e g o t three s m a s h i n g clear
rounds in the j u m p i n g . Z o e almost got us
a fourth but the hose decided to sit d o w n
o n t h e last fence.
It w a s t h e final s h o w for us o n Royal
Holloway territory w o u l d not get in to the
South of England s h o w s but w e w o u l d
definitely g o out with a bang. Rachel
was s o d r u g g e d u p o n pain killers f r o m
her injured leg that s h e fell asleep during
the dressage. D i a n a followed suit a n d
also did the w r o n g test, but Kath a n d Z o e
c o m p e n s a t e d with beautiful dressage
tests. Rachel couldn't c o m p e t e in j u m p -
ing because o f her leg. Z o e a n d Kath
rode clear rounds. Then, frightcningly,
Diana fell o f f a beast called W o m b l e .
O u r final position w a s fourth place.
Well d o n e girls, a n d better luck next year
w h e n w e will have t w o teams.

STREET HOCKEY
The/re new, they"re fast, and they're on the verge of success
M e e t i n g very early o n a Sunday morning,
the ICU Street Hockey T e a m (we haven't
thought o f a nickname yet) a s s e m b l e d a
few m e m b e r s short. W e w e r e lacking the
dazzling skills o f Vicent a n d Baz as w e
thought that they must have still b e e n in
bed. It didn't make our chances s e e m t o o
g o o d as w e h e a d e d for our first tourna-
ment with only seven players. W e arrived
at Warwick k n o w i n g that our chances did
not s e e m s o g o o d with so f e w players -
a normal t e a m has four players a n d a
keeper with rolling subs.
W e played our first match against
Edinburgh U n i , o n the tournament pitch
which was a third of the size and more slip-
pery surface than t h e o n e w e ' r e used to.
The first g a m e w a s scrappy a n d very dis-
organised for our t e a m as w e adjusted to
the surface. O u r inexperience in "serious"
matches s h o w e d as our keeper T e e n a
played well but w a s not used to high
velocity balls being fired at her face. As a
result of this w e lost t h e first match quite
drastically. Luckily at the e n d o f the match,
Warwick offered us their third keeper as
w e didn't have our o w n goalie e q u i p -
ment a n d he did. O u r thanks to Ben for
playing with us for the rest of the matches.
There w a s anothet surprise for us as Baz
s h o w e d , having got the train up despite
missing his lift to the tournament.
Things were looking up as w e headed
into our next g a m e against the Newcas-
tle Wildcats, w h o looked as though they'd
be aggressive, but turned out to be fine.
We played a lot better with g oo d runs from
O n g a n d Andy leading to an excellent
goal. The defence started playing a lot bet-
ter with Ket, Teena and Matt rarely failing
in keeping their attackers at bay. Lise used
her extensive k n o w l e d g e of the g a m e to
organise the team throughout, despite
not feeling too well, leading to our better
results. Unfortunately our players still tired
a little at the e n d and the Wildcats got an
equaliser in the final minute. A well played
g a m e nonetheless.
The next games' that followed w e r e
against the Birmingham Beavers, Leeds
Uni and Warwick Uni. The Beavers played
a very rough g a m e with tactics like body
barging (such as M o into our goal via his
face), a n d despite losing w e played well.
Leeds played extremely well a n d t h o u g h
our man-to-man marking really s e e m e d to
close u p their g a m e they still had t h e
experience to w i n , a n d eventually did so.
Warwick Uni also played very well, a n d
beat us to c o m e s e c o n d .
O u r final g a m e w a s against C a m -
bridge, a n d w e n e e d e d to win it to c o m e
sixth, a n d it had to be by a very large goal
margin of seven to c o m e fifth. W e started
off well, but quickly b e c a m e quite crap as
fatigue set into our team. It w a s a scrappy
g a m e that w e should have w o n easily, but
only w o n 3 - 2. W e came sixth out of eight,
which isn't b a d for a team that the DP
(C&S) didn't k n o w existed until last
Wednesday.
All in all w e did very well for our first
competition with our limited amount of
players a n d the fact that w e were a mixed
team. This is hopefully the first o f many
competitions that are being set up, and w e
want to g o to as many as possible. W e ' d
like to thank Ncrissa for driving s o m e of
us d o w n , getting f o o d at lunchtime and
being our only non-playing supporter. If
there are a n y ex or current street/ice
hockey players w h o w o u l d like to join a n d
play, or any skaters w h o ' d like to try it out,
