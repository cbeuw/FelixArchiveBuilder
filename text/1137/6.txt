Keep It Down!
Dear Felix
The local police have recently passed
onto the U n i o n a n u m b e r o f c o n c e r n s
f r o m local residents a b o u t the level o f
noise o n Prince Consort Road after the
bars close a n d U n i o n events finish.
The U n i o n w o r k e d extremely hard to
obtain its licence, involving a lot of n e g o -
tiation with our neighbours, and the local
police. If w e are to keep the licence (and
so our late night events), it is up to the
people leaving our events to have s o m e
respect for the local residents a n d keep
noise levels d o w n in residential areas -
which includes the Q u a d , a n d o n t h e
street outside Beit Hall.
Don't b e o n e o f the handful that
could spoil it for everyone, please k e e p
the noise d o w n w h e n leaving the U n i o n
- r e m e m b e r w e are only a small part o f
the local c o m m u n i t y .
Thanks

How to Stop Bike Theft?
Dear Felix
Last Friday e v e n i n g I d e c i d e d , quite out
of the blue, t o sink a f e w jars in South-
side after work. A c o u p l e w a s stretched
into a few, as they do, a n d I e n d e d u p
d o i n g the sensible t h i n g a n d w a l k i n g
h o m e . O n M o n d a y I c a m e to collect my
bike from the racks to the side of the bar,
only to find almost 100 p o u n d s w o r t h of
parts missing from the frame. N o n e w e r e
quick release, s o s o m e little shit h a d
b e e n there r e m o v i n g t h e m with tools.
The main frame of the bike w a s secured
with a g o o d quality D-lock.
I w e n t straight to security to m a k e a
report and was told this sort of theft hap-
pened at least o n c e a week, often more,
from those racks alone! I then asked if w e
could vie w the film f r o m t h e security
camera, only t o b e told there was n o
camera erected there. N o c h a n c e o f
catching a n y o n e for this o n e t h e n .
I inquired further a n d d i s c o v e r e d
that there is only o n e c a m e r a o n t h e
w h o l e of the campus, w h i c h covers the
bike racks outside RSM. ( Incidentally, I
have a friend w h o s e bike w a s stolen
from there not so l o n g a g o a n d he was
gutted to find out that security had not
even t u r n e d t h e c a m e r a o n ! ) This
s e e m e d a little bit silly, considering all the
bikes that c o m e in and out of the College
daily. M a y b e the police will b e able t o
help I thought.
So there I f o u n d myself actually lis-
tening properly and taking h e e d of the
words f r o m o n e of our boys in blue.
He suggested I write a letter to those
in authority to try a n d get things m o v i n g
o n this front. He told m e that Bclgravia
police station are getting tired o f t h e
time wasted in filling out theft reports
f r o m our c a m p u s a n d have got n o w h e r e
with their requests for full electronic sur-
veillance. I told h i m that even our secu-
rity h a d noticed this c u n n i n g pattern o f
theft, but n o t h i n g had b e e n d o n e t o
stop it. So w h y then, have our p e o p l e
ignored these requests f r o m the local
police w h o a r e s u p p o s e d to b e fully
c o o p e r a t i n g with our security measures?
Maybe, after finally managing to stop
the weekly computer chip thefts from the
last f e w years, w e may b e able l o c o n -
centrate o n preserving the properly o f
the students, not just that of the College
entity itself.
M a y b e s o m e o f the m o n e y u s e d t o
purchase such things as the d e a d trees
that are so delicately planted outside the
B M S building or the intricately w o v e n
patterns o f c h e a p bushes outside t h e
library, in future could be spent o n sys-
t e m s to protect the students' scanty pos-
sessions.
I d o not k n o w w h y things have not
got m o v i n g o n this front, e v e n with
police persuasion. M a y b e our old friend
C a l d w e l l is r e s p o n s i b l e , w h i c h w o u l d
explain everything. Answers please.

There are actually two security cameras
o n Watts W a y - o n e just o u t s i d e t h e
Health Centre a n d the other at the other
e n d ; it is actually impossible to place a
c a m e r a o v e r l o o k i n g the bike racks in
such a way that it d o e s not infringe the
privacy of other local residents, the n u m -
ber o f bike thefts outside Southside is
a b o u t the s a m e as the n u m b e r outside
the Shcrfield Building -18 for the w h o l e
of 1998. I here are three cameras cover-
ing bike racks directly, not c o u n t i n g the
Southside ones. I'm not saying that the
system is perfect - there arc too m a n y
bike parks a n d resources are limited. W e
d o w o r k closely with the local police in
this regard - last year, seven separate
plain-clothes operations w e r e m o u n t e d
w h e r e they m a d e use of college facilities
to identify a n d a p p r e h e n d bike thieves,
while security staff m a d e eight bike-theft
related arrests. Bike thefts are prevalent
in c o l l e g e s - particularly urban o n e s
w h e r e a lot of students a n d m e m b e r s of
staff use Ihem, a n d a lot o f the bike
thievery that takes place here is o r g a n -
ised in nature, not opportunistic.

Focus Group on Apathy?
Dear Felix,
I a m writing about my concerns regard-
ing the IC apathy that w e k n o w so well.
Over the past f e w weeks, the U n i o n has
devised a way for all IC students to play
a part in t h e everyday r u n n i n g o f the
U n i o n services. I was very d i s a p p o i n t e d
to find that, after special days w e r e
arranged for students to turn up to the
so-called F O C U S G R O U P S , that only a
handful o f p e o p l e turned up. Over the
four years I have b e e n at IC, I have b e e n
heavily involved with t h e U n i o n , a n d
k n o w that it tries its very hardest to pro-
vide the services that the students s o
badly n e e d . After over 400 direct e-mails
to students, t w o w e e k s of advertising in
Felix a n d n u m e r o u s posters a r o u n d the
college, I find it very surprising that IC stu-
dents don't really care about h o w their
Union is run for them. Over the years, the
U n i o n h a s r e c e i v e d n u m e r o u s c o m -
plaints a n d criticisms about the various
services that it runs, a n d n o w , after they
have had t h e c h a n c e t o c h a n g e a n d
modify these services to suit their needs,
the IC apathy strikes again. I n o w ask
myself that d o IC students really care
about their Union?

Cynical Conscience
Dear felix,
I was intrigued by last w e e k ' s c o m m e n t
entitled "The A u d i b l e C o n s c i e n c e " .
A l t h o u g h t h e article was devastatingly
pessimistic and about as subtle as a GCSE
English essay, it was still g o o d t o s e e
s o m e criticism o f our m o d e r n , urban
lifestyle.
Besides d a m n i n g nearly everything
caused by mass urbanisation, the article
focussed o n very important issues such
as poverty, homelessness, pollution a n d
traffic. This is all s u m m e d up with a c o m -
plaint about h o w apathetic everybody is
and h o w things can not c h a n g e as a
result.
What I find particularly frustrating
about this article and other similar articles
is that they do not m e n t i o n any positive
m e a n s of action. O n c e the reader's c o n -
s c i e n c e is satisfactorily s h a k e n , they
should then be presented with ways that
they can d o s o m e t h i n g a b o u t t h e s e
issues. The article s h o u l d c o n t i n u e so it
can m e n t i o n steps w e c a n take t o
o p p o s e our "meaningless existence". This
could be d o n e simply by m e n t i o n i n g rel-
evant action groups, outlining steps that
can b e t a k e n as w e l l as g i v i n g M P s
addresses such that w e can voice our
concerns.
H o p e f u l l y , a m o r e b a l a n c e d
a p p r o a c h t o this type o f article will
encourage people to be more perceptive
a n d less apathetic.
