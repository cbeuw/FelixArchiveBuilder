N a t u r e o n t o
Doowutyalike f r o m
Digitial U n d e r g r o u n d ,
before stalling o n D e La
Soul's ridiculously l o n g
Buddy (remix). T h e n t h e
killer tune pulls u p a n d
hits y a - Can't You See.
This R&B a n t h e m w a s t h e
first thing w e heard f r o m
the b a d girls, Total a n d it
simply b l e w m e a w a y
then, a n d still d o e s to this
day. To k e e p t h e g r o o v e

s o n g Ladies First is d r o p p e d in next, Q u e e n Latifah
rocks the m i c over a styled out s a x o p h o n e riff, b e f o r e
M o n i e Love ( r e m e m b e r her) kicks o u t a f e w rhymes.
Then c o m e s t h e massive crossover hit f r o m H o u s e o f
Pain, y o u k n o w what it is, right?...Yeah...that's right
Jump Around. From that H o u s e o f pain party tune w e

GREATEST
BEATS
party tunes with t h e classic O.P.P. a n d A p a c h e s
Gangsta Bitch.
Switching over the s e c o n d disc I w a s hit with the
all time great D e La Soul tune Me, Myself and I, all those
old skool m e m o r i e s c o m e f l o o d i n g back, but they dis-
appear just as quickly with the next tune the awful
H o u s e O f Pain track Shamrocks And Shenanigans. W h y
is this shit track next to D e La Soul? A serious disap-
p o i n t m e n t after s u c h a
g o o d start. But they
r e d e e m themselves with
C o o l i o ' s g-funk driven
Fantastic Voyage, the only
d r a w b a c k is t h e Timber
Remix w h e n t h e original
mix is s o m u c h better.
Pairs' Grip of Shame is
included here, but why?
There are superior Paris
tunes to pick so w h y this
one? Next u p is Q u e e n
Latifahs chilled out Lati-
fahs Had it Up There, a
p r i m e e x a m p l e o f t h e
girls skills before m o v i n g
o n to a c o u p l e o f mas-
sive chart hits. N a u g h t y
By N a t u r e s Hip Hop
Hooray a n d t h e spot hit-
ter Come Baby Come from K7. The final run d o w n c o n -
sists of a scries of old skool classics, the standout of the
b u n c h b e i n g D e La Souls w i c k e d Ring, Ring, Ring,
before the finishing track, Coolio's Dangerous M i n d s sin-
gle Gangsta's Paradise.
The w h o l e package is w o n d e r f u l value for m o n e y ,
but I w o u l d have preferred just o n e disc full o f t h e
absolute classics, without the fillers.
Disc 1 - 8 / 1 0 Disc 2 = 7/10

TLC
T
h o u g h a certain press officer f r o m a major U K
label will disagree, TLCs o n e a n d only hit in
the U K w a s Waterfalls-a swingin' ballad m a n y
years a g o . N o w , the trio are back with a c o m p l e t e
revamp, not only o f their musical talents but of their
attitudes too. Simply put, TLC a r c g o o d ; no, actually
they are brilliant - a fact reflected in their c o m e b a c k
a l b u m Eanmail. Fanmail has taken TLC into a n e w
d i m e n s i o n as they include p r o d u c t i o n w o r k f r o m Jam
a n d Lewis (Janet Jackson), Jermaine Dupri (Mariah
Carey) a n d n e w b o y Shekspere. T h e a l b u m features
17 tracks a n d covers t h e full s p e c t r u m o f great R&B
flavas. There a r c tunes with hard bass lines a n d husky
vocals such as Fanmail a n d Silly Ho, the emotive bal-
lads such as No Scrubs, a s l o w a n d groovy track. T h e
funky a n d vocal tracks such as Shout, I'm No Good at
Being Bad m a k e great listening, whilst / Miss You so
Much, Come Down a n d LJnpretty ate t h e love s o n g s
of the a l b u m with w o n d e r f u l vocals a n d simple tunes.
In b e t w e e n s o m e o f the tracks are interludes - 30-sec-
o p d clips o f t h e girls talking about whatever. This
a l b u m is breathtaking a n d t h e C D cover features a
great holographic i m a g e o f TLC. N o doubt TLC arc o n
their w a y back, a n d with Eanmail, 1999 s h o u l d s e e
t h e m b e c o m e a h u g e force to b e r e c k o n e d with o n
the R&B s c e n e .
