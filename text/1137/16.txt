16 Elections 99/00 - Interviews 22 February 1999
DP (Mutation & Welfare)
# Kevin Butcher
What do you see as your role in this new
post within the Union?
I think the role is fairly undefined at
the moment, and the biggest part of the
job would involve taking a lot o f work off
the president, which is really good because
it means they'll be able to be more of a
figurehead. I think the main points arc
being involved with the welfare commit-
tee, a c c o m m o d a t i o n , academic affairs,
student d e v e l o p m e n t - those kind of
things that would be covered by the edu-
cation and welfare remit. But as I say in my
manifesto it's going to take m e the sum-
mer to pull a job description together.
College Is quite a difficult Institution to
m o v e In a n d t o change. H o w d o y o u
Intend to make a stand for the students
w h e n it c o m e s t o a situation o f conflict?
I think being a postgraduate has really
helped out - I'm involved with lots of
c o m m i t t e e s in the department, most
notably the health a n d safety committee
in the Biochemistry Department, as a post-
graduate representative. Recently I was
seconded to the International Studenls
Committee, and they d o listen to what stu-
dents have to say. Ihey're always not try-
ing to be too forceful - thev may seem like
a slow moving organisation with regards
to students, but they d o listen. It's being
forceful a n d nice a n d putting a point
across
What would you do about the current
appointment delay and the clinic closures
on Tuesday afternoons?
I thinkthe Health Centre and the way
they're running it at the moment is prob-
ably O K considering the staffing levels, but
11 think in terms of service and quality it's
not very good at all. It should be open dur-
ing office hours plus a f e w more either
side. I think being closed o n a luesday
afternoon is really poor.
You're taking a certain workload away
from the president - what areas are cur-
rently lacking that you will address?
I think certainly this year, a n d I don't
want to d o d o w n anyone w h o has been
involved this year, is the fact that they are
non-sabbatical positions and are doing it
in their spare time. I think something that's
been lacking this year is awareness of
events a n d I think this is a big thing to
focus o n next year.
How will you get out information to the
students, and what else we are going to
gain from you as our officer?
I think the biggest way is getting out
there. Certainly today w h e n I was in the JCR
I got a lot of people talking to m e about
the position. I thinkthe education and wel-
fare stuff o n the w e b is old, to a certain
degree - it's not bad, but it certainly needs
updating.
Felix Editor
David Roberts
How do you feel that your previous
roles within Felix have helped you pre-
pare for this editorship?
I think it gives m e s o m e all r o u n d
k n o w l e d g e o f w h a t Felix is a b o u t . T h e
film editor makes m e get involved with
all t h e other students w h o c o m e in
w h o w a n t to c o n t r i b u t e a n d m a k e s
m e get u s e d to t h e e d i t i n g process.
D o i n g a lot o f n e w s writing, I get t o
k n o w all t h e p e o p l e a r o u n d t h e U n i o n
and a r o u n d C o l l e g e , s o I get to k n o w
just w h o ' s important a n d w h e r e t o g o
for information. A n d b e i n g Advertising
M a n a g e r gives m e a fairly solid grasp
of t h e f i n a n c e s o f Felix a n d w h e r e all
the m o n e y c o m e s f r o m w h i c h ,
a l t h o u g h it's not s o m e t h i n g that stu-
dents reallv care about very m u c h , is a
very important part of t h e j o b .
So what do you think your methods are
for attracting writers, editors and read-
ers?
Ihe first t h i n g is just to m a k e it
s e e m f u n - I m e a n , o n e of the b i g
things w e get is a n awful lot of review
writers, b e c a u s e it's l u n , y o u get a lot
of freebies out o f it - y o u got a lot o f
free m u s i c a n d free films, a n d that
kind o f thing. N e w s writers, f r o m that
point o f view, a n d Feature writers - it's
just a case of s e e i n g your n a m e in
print, it's f u n There's quite a rush in
s e e i n g your n a m e in print o n M o n d a y
m o r n i n g . After a f e w w e e k s t h i n g s
c h a n g e , y o u reallv get the s e n s e that
y o u ' v e m a d e a difference, w h i c h is a
w o n d e r f u l t h i n g about the j o b . a n d
o n e of the things I reallv like - just t h e
c h a n c e to really feel y o u m a k e a dif-
ference.
A central part of [reporting] news
around Imperial College and student
issues Is the objectivity - looking at it
from both sides. How do you intend to
protect that and the editorial stance of
Felix?
I think Felix is always very i n d e -
p e n d e n t - I don't think w e take t o o
m u c h o l a line - certainly not a college
line. I think most of the: time w e m a n -
a g e to avoid a U n i o n line - o n e o f t h e
big problems is, I think, the case of
bias; I know I'm not great on this issue,
and it's a case of trying to keep it
objective and trying to avoid dishing
the dirt in an unfair way. It's really just
a case of presenting all the informa-
tion, just putting down all the facts,
getting all the quotes.
Do you intend to make a millennium
fifty years production as your last ques-
tion - how are you going to make the
Impact?
We're getting together all the old
editors - they're meeting up for may-
day this year, getting together, and
hopefully we'll have information com-
ing from all fifty years.
