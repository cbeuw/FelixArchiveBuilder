The S t u d e n t s ' N e w s p a p e r at I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e
Promises, Policies and Pints
Hustings w e r e held last w e e k at South
Kensington, Charing Cross, and St Mary's
for the Sabbatical candidates.
Last Monday, a r o u n d a h u n d r e d and
fifty people, encouraged by the " p o u n d a
pint" offer, turned up in dB's. If they w e r e
expecting a tense night o f political thrills
and d e e p issues, they w o u l d have b e e n
disappointed, however. There s e e m e d lit-
tle to distinguish most o f the candidates
on what are felt to be the major issues fac-
ing t h e U n i o n : minibuses, BUSA, club
funding, C C U identity and s o o n .
There w a s a similar feel to t h e St.
Mary's Hustings, traditionally a m u c h
harsher session. There w e r e m o r e prob-
ing questions from the sixty or so students
there - particularly over BUSA, Glaxo's pro-
posed takeover of part o f t h e M e d i c a l
School (reported below) a n d problems
related to the M e d i c i n e course - but the
overall atmosphere was m o r e s u b d u e d
than had been expected.

day w e r e poorly attended - probably due
to a party at the s a m e time. O n e candi-
date remarked that it was "very dull and
very pointless".
U p first w e r e Dave Roberts and Kevin
Butcher, the only candidates standing for
The Presidential hopefuls sink their pints
Felix Editor a n d DP (E&W) respectively.
Having set out their promises, they fielded
q u e s t i o n s f r o m t h e floor. Dave w a s
strongly in favour of editorial f r e e d o m ,
and defended Felix's role as a club. Kevin
identified s o m e specific issues, but admit-
ted that deep-seated attitudes would take
s o m e l i m e to change. He was receptive
to n e w ideas, such as a counsellor for the
medical campuses.
Both w e n t d o w n fairly well with the
crowds, although Kevin received a n ini-
tially harsh reception at Mary's. Best
quote? Kevin's "IQ are a tight bunch of
people" at Mary's was an unfortunate slip.
The candidates for D P (C&S) w e r e
next. M o s t o f the differences between
Tim Traitor and D u n c a n Field s e e m e d to
be o n their different (sporting and non-
sporting) backgrounds. O n e argument
runs that the major issues such as BUSA
n e e d s o m e o n e familiar with t h e sports
teams. O n the other hand, only about a
quarter of the clubs are sports teams, and
the DP (C&S) needs to look after the inter-
ests of all o f the clubs.
Both promised to fight for dual rather
than single entry o f M e d i c teams into
BUSA, with Tim preferring to keep the cur-

The biggest c o n c e r n about the pro-

The exact r e a s o n i n g b e h i n d t h e
