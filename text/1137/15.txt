Tim Trailor
What are your views o n t h e current
medlc/non-medlc club hybrid split?
Hybrid's probably the best system
we've got at the moment, a n d I'd like to
see that going for at least the next two and
a half years, which is the agreed period,
and I'd like to look at possibly extending
that, especially for the big clubs and soci-
eties w h o have fulfiled their full quota of
BUSA teams, for possibly a couple of years
after that. But once we've had the full
quota of medics through the South Kens-
ington campus, I thinkwe'd then need to
look at reviewing the situation. But keep
it until we've had the full quota of students
through the South Kensington campus.
I understand you've had quite a lot o f
experience In t h e sporting side o f things,
but what about w h e n It comes to over-
seeing societies - what experience do you
have for this?
Overseas societies. I haven't actually
had m u c h contact with the overseas soci-
eties at Imperial, but I think that it's impor-
tant to fund every club and society, and
I've got quite a g o o d background, in that
I knovvaboul mulik nili nal i .u -.and reli-
gious issues, i wi luld like lo apply that gen-
eral background to the dubs and societies
here at IC.
Would y o u change the current procedure
for setting up a n e w club a n d help give
m o t e support to n e w clubs?
I here is currently quite a g o o d p r o
cedurc for setting up n e w clubs and soci-
eties - there is a handbook out which tells
you in quite a lot of detail what you need
to d o to set up a club. Anyone w h o comes
into the resource centre o n the first floor
of the Union building will find out from
either Neil O'Shaughnessy, w h o s e the
administrator there, or from the DP (C&S),
exactly what needs to be done. It's a fairly
pain free process.
What is your opinion o f ULU and the cur-
rent stance o f Imperial within that Union?
ULU pretty much mirrors the; BUSA sit-
uation in terms of leagues and things like
that, and especially Ihe entry require-
ments, although it didn't for part of last
year. It's the hybrid entry system - the
same teams can enter in both competi-
tions.
In your hustings speech y o u w e r e talking
about a sports ground in Ealing that Impe-
rial was thinking about selling off. W h y d o
y o u think that'd be good?
It's a sport ground that's currently
being rented out for agricultural use, or it
was once a sports ground apparently. It
was m e n t i o n e d in a c o m p r e h e n s i v e
review that trank Murray did last month
in which they're looking at rationalising
Imperial College sports grounds. As it's a
ground that's not actually used by anybody
at the m o m e n t it w o u l d be quite a g o o d
candidate for selling off without causing
anybody any problems.

Could y o u expand o n your ideas o n h o w
you expect clubs t o m a k e Income over
the year?
I think there are o n e or two societies
that are already pretty adept at bringing
their o w n m o n e y into the Union. Dram-
Soc, which I have personal experience of,
is o n e of those, a n d clubs like the Pimllco
society, w h o are sponsored externally, I
believe. I think w e need to investigate the
possibility o f whether external sponsor-
ship can provide extra money, as in the
current economic climate everbody's hav-
ing to tighten their belts.
A n d h o w w o u l d y o u propose to help
these clubs get sponsorship?
I w o u l d be looking at communicat-
ing with companies in the London finan-
cial markets, companies that w e tradi-
tionally have a goo d relationship with, like
Andersen Consulting, that kind of thing.
We w o u l d be saying 'look, you're coming
and head-hunting at Imperial every year,
you can have a lot o f g o o d publicity and
press from helping our sports a n d soci-
eties.' I w o u l d then be operating as a
mediator between the companies and
the clubs - trying to put people together,
arrange meetings, that kind of thing.
What is your stance o n t h e medic/non-
medic sporting situation, and h o w w o u l d
y o u make hybrid entry easier?
There's quite a few problems with
the: hybrid system at the moment, mainly
administrative;. It is doing its job - it is pro-
viding the medics the opportunity to play
for either ICSM or ICU. But there arc:
problems with trying to work out w h o s e
playing lor which team a n d stopping
them playing for more than o n e team in
a season, a n d also problems administra-
tively with BUSA and the U L U leagues
sending information to us w h e n it should
be going to St. Mary's. We need proactive
effective communication lo overcome
Pthis problem, m a k i n g sure that BUSA
knows what's g o i n g o n .
What m a d e y o u want to d o this job, a n d
what clubs and societies have y o u b e e n
involved with?
I've been a m e m b e r of DramSoc for
four years, director of acting for o n e year;
I set u p and a m chairman this year of the
Environmental Society, I've been involved
with Pimlico society for a term as a tutor,
and I've been a m e m b e r of various other
societies including ArtSoc a n d St John's
Ambulance Links. The reason I wanted to
do this w a s essentially because I found it
very difficult over the last couple of years
to be as involved with the Union as I
w o u l d like, primarily because of financial
constraints and because I find the degree
at Imperial very d e m a n d i n g - w h o does-
n't? DP (C&S) will give m e the opportunity
to really get stuck in a n d d o what I've
b e e n w a n t i n g to d o for the last four
years.
