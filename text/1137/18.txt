18 ComicSoc 22 February 1999
Dark alleys, sinister "bad guys" and enough mindless violence to make a Medic cringe.
ICU provides a vast array of media forms for its impassive and unappreciative students.
Yet, it does not s e e m to offer anything that specifically quenches
the thirst of the current generation of Playstation hoodlums*
and Star Wars: Lpisode 1 nutcases. (Apparently these pcopf JI-
called "students" for reasons of politics and economic: bank-
ruptcy). v
During the latter months of 1998, a solution to this famine w a s f o u n d . F
Having been mentally mutated by overexposure to the general media, a small
group of "students" embarked o n a quest - a quest to create a publi-
cation that would be worthy e n o u g h to satisfy the savage hunger of all "stu-
dents" in Imperial College.
tollowing months o f practice to achieve excellence In the
art form known only as "Quake 2", work began o n producing the first pages of the
n e w publication. Practically conceived in the backyard of City & Guilds College Union
or their office at least), these minions spat o n anyone w h o so m u c h as even
muttered "Beano", "Dandy" or that great institution of British art, "Viz".
The result? This page conveys the first images of the evil and wicked ideas that
have transcended through the brains of these "students". Look closely. Look hard. You
can almost see the hardcore caffeine addiction that possesses these people. The count-
less hours that have been spent o n each stroke include the time spent in front of a
pool table, watching Neighbours and arguing over whether a plot has accidentally
slipped into the "story".

was this good.
"Knife Edge" is a semi-
futuristic strip orientated around the
artists' love for robots, vampires a n d /
anything vaguely manga. Yes - it's a male ; j
thing.
Is it True Lies? Is it James Bond? N o - its "Raptor". Assas-
sins for hire d o not c o m e in any flavour like this. As cool oni

ready.
"Worlds Apart" features flying space ships, a strange planet called D o C
and a fellow from "Eye See You" w h o goes by the name of Dave Hellard Hell

e n o u g h to write for Felix? Too intelligent for Guildsheet? there is always a w e l c o m e
mat for artists, but since this group is already populated with this form of species, any
other kind is also particularly appreciated. Rest assured that, upon joining this Borg-
like collective conscious, your individual talents and abilities would be assimilated into,
the whole.
So w h e n does this explosive graphical masterpiece finally detonate? Before y o u
\ are convinced o f the idea that this amusing "feature", much like your very o w n \
CV, is a work of pure fiction, the heavens have dictated a summer 1999 launch /
for the highly spectacular first issue. Hold your a w e and astonishment until then, ,-f
as exam relief is o n its way. You can almost hear the editors
of Felix and Phoenix w e e p at the amount of material they have
lost.
In 1972, a crack c o m m a n d o unit w a s sent to prison by a
military court for a crime they didn't commit. These m e n
promptly escaped a maximum-security stockade to the Los
Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the govern-
ment, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a prob-
lem, if n o o n e else can help, and if you can find them, maybe
you can hire... the A-Team.
O n the other hand, you should always remember that the
ICU ComicSoc will always save any damsel in distress. What
do y o u m e a n a slap is all it takes to make a M e d i c cringe?
