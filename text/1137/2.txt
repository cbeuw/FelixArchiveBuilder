rent hybrid system for as l o n g as possible.
The issue of the sale of Teddington sports
ground (the traditional h o m e of Mary's
rugby) was a hot topic at Mary's. Both can-
didates promised to fight to keep it o p e n .
Tim h i g h l i g h t e d m o n e y , s p a c e a n d
minibuses as the main issues affecting all
clubs. Duncan agreed, but also a d d e d fair
treatment from the U n i o n , referring to Art-
soc's recent budget cuts.
The issue of minibuses was surpris-
ingly painless, considering the discussion
that has been g o i n g o n recently. Both Tim
and D u n c a n (and later, the D P (F&S) can-
didates) thought the U n i o n buses w e r e in
a bad way, but p r o m i s e d to look into the
options available.
There s e e m e d to b e very little to sep-
arate the three candidates for the post of
DP (F&S) other than dress sense. Whilst
Paul H i c k m a n a v o i d e d criticism, B o b
Walker's dangling belt raised c o m m e n t o n
all three nights, a n d Ian Clifford u p h e l d
half of his Slave Auction promise to attend
the South Ken Hustings in drag. Various
methods o f increasing the Union's, a n d
particularly clubs', b u d g e t s w e r e s u g -
gested: sponsorship, greater efficiency
and "screwing C o l l e g e out o f everything
w e can get" - Bob's phrase, but e n d o r s e d
by Ian a n d Paul.
All candidates agreed that loss-mak-
ing services should be subsidised, as l o n g
as they w e r e providing a g e n u i n e service
to students - catering being a prime e x a m -
ple. They also re-iterated the regulations
concerning additional i n c o m e generated
by clubs: that ICU technically couldn't
touch it, a n d it s h o u l d not b e c o m p e n -
sated for by a r e d u c e d budget.
Finally, the candidates for President
t o o k to the stage. All except Stuart Cook,
that is, w h o has taken no part in the elec-
tions so far. This left Shan Katuwawala,
Tasha N e w t o n , Dennis Patrickson, Robin
Pitt, Ben Polounovsky and A n d y Swift.
Q u e s t i o n s o n a broad range o f top-
ics w e r e asked. A c o m m o n t h e m e was
the elections themselves, with issues such
as South Ken apathy, the M e d i c s ' alleged
block voting, a n d publicity recurring at
different Hustings.
O n topics such as fees, politics, a n d
the NUS, Robin was the only overly polit-
ical candidate; he was also the only o n e
to favour greater integration w i t h the
NUS, although he w o u l d put this to a ref-
e r e n d u m . Everyone else distanced t h e m -
selves f r o m party politics. A n d y a n d Shan
a g r e e d that the N U S was a nice idea, but
ineffective in practice. Tasha considered
it t o o political, a n d Ben a n d D e n n i s
favoured other options.
All t h e c a n d i d a t e s s e e m to b e in
favour of increased C C U activity and iden-
tity. In fact, w h e n a s k e d w h a t they
thought was Dave Hellard's biggest error,
Tasha, Shan a n d Dennis said that it was
the increasing divide b e t w e e n ICU a n d
the CCUs. Robin said that it was failing to
publicise the fight against fees; A n d y crit-
icised his handling of club f u n d i n g ; Ben
d e c i d e d that the 'Presidential Talkback'
p h o t o was the absolute low point.
O n e area w h e r e all the candidates
w a n t to bring about changes is c o m m u -
nications t h r o u g h o u t the College. Shan
w a n t e d to use the CCUs, clubs a n d soci-
eties m o r e effectively. Tasha, Ben and
Dennis favoured m o r e reports in Felix, as
well as email a n d phones. Dennis also
advocated a U n i o n newsletter, a n d better
Council publicity. A n d y w a n t e d m u c h
greater use of email, while Robin pre-
ferred the direct approach of talking to
people.
N o o n e candidate s e e m e d to gain
consistently m o r e approval than the oth-
ers, especially at South Ken. At Mary's,
Tasha fared well, although Shan h e l p e d
his cause by criticising Dave Hellard, a n d
telling Chris Ince to "shut the fuck up."
Dennis and A n d y c a m e out well; Robin's
enthusiasm for politics w o n over several
people; a n d Ben's offbeat approach dis-
tinguished h i m from the others.
O n e g o o d thing about Hustings Is
w a t c h i n g the candidates d o silly things in
an attempt to win favour. So at South Ken
w e had Dave Hellard kissing Bob Walker;
Ian Clifford in a short skirt; the Presiden-
tial candidates d o w n i n g a truly unpleasant-
l o o k i n g pint of Carlsberg, Bailey's a n d
Coke,- and a brief Riverdance. Medics take
their drinking seriously - each candidate
at St. Mary's was required to d o w n a pint
of lager before they answered their ques-
tions. O n a similar line, there w e r e sev-
eral q u e s t i o n s that w e r e s o m e w h a t
irreverent: candidates' favourite jokes and
masturbation habits c a m e up.
The c h e a p beer e n c o u r a g e d the
occasional unwise c o m m e n t . The Felix
reporter's lasting m e m o r y of the South
Ken Hustings will be a certain prominent
U n i o n official declaring that he w a n t e d
another well k n o w n personality "up my
arse". A truly lovely image.
Interviews with the candidates are

STOP PRESS - Siege
update
The siege of the G r e e k Embassy in Hol-
land Park c a m e to an e n d as fiefec went
to press o n Thursday, with 50 Kurdish pro-
testers a g r e e i n g to leave the building in
w h a t a p p e a r e d to be a peaceful e n d to
the standoff.
The demonstrators negotiated with
police by t e l e p h o n e all m o r n i n g after
setting themselves a 1 p m deadline for
e n d i n g their protest. They eventually
b e g a n to e m e r g e slightly after 2 p m , one
at a time, with h a n d s held aloft, and
w e r e escorted by police officers to a line
to be searched a n d h a n d c u f f e d . They
w e r e t h e n led a w a y to police buses, and
w e r e later c h a r g e d under the Preven-
tion of Terrorism Act.
The first person out of the embassy
is believed to have b e e n the protesters'
hostage, Greek junior official Babis Pat-
souris, w h o a p p e a r e d to b e well. N o
details of the deal w h i c h led to the sur-
render have b e e n c o n f i r m e d .
