t h e o b v i o u s c h o i c e s ,
the choice is
If you know that your future lies within the IT industry,
consider this: some of the most exciting and rewarding
IT roles are not in the IT industry. Don't just take our
word for it - find out for yourself, by applying for a
summer IT placement with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
Many of the developments currently driving IT forward
come not from the IT industry itself, but from those
businesses whose needs and applications are sufficiently
critical to spur the IT industry on to ever more innovative
solutions. As one of the world's leading global
investment banks, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter is
such a business.
For proof of our commitment, look no further than
the $1.5 billion we invested in IT last year. Everything
we do is right at the cutting edge of IT development.
The technology is second to none, the applications
are complex and challenging, and the environment
is one in which excellence is expected, recognised
and rewarded.
You'll spend your 12 weeks with us working on live
projects with tangible consequences for the business.
As such, this is the perfect opportunity to put your IT
skills to a meaningful test.
And because you'll be making a very real contribution,
you'll be recognised accordingly. Whilst you'll find the
financial rewards highly attractive, you'll also benefit
from on-the-job technical training, commercial and
management development, as well as the possibility of
a full time position once you've finished your degree.
Clearly, competition for these placements will be intense.
Convince us that you've got what it takes and we'll
convince you that there isn't a more exciting arena for
your IT career than Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
To apply, please send your cv to Kathryn Wragg at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, 25 Cabot Square,
Canary Wharf, London El 4 4 Q A . For more information
