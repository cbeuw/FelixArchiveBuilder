shocking spectacle o f a schoolgirl setting
herself alight outside t h e G r e e k Embassy
in L o n d o n . Described a s "fearless a n d
passionate", Nejla Kanteper w a s o n e o f
a group of angry Kurds protesting outside
the Embassy in fury at t h e arrest o f rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan in Nairobi, Kenya.
The well-orchestrated protests t o o k
place in m a n y major European capitals,
including The Hague , B o n n a n d V i e n n a ,
as well as in Vancouver a n d Sydney. Kur-

refused to c o m m e n t , while t h e White
House admitted that it w a s "very pleased"
at t h e arrest, w h i l e d e n y i n g any direct
involvement. (The US sees t h e PKK as a

following intelligence reports, stopped

left the e m b a s s y against their advice in
the face o f allegations that they h a d
paved t h e w a y for Ocalan's arrest in the
interest o f m a i n t a i n i n g s m o o t h relations
with Turkey. The treatment Turkey hands

The Foreign O f f i c e has w a r n e d hol-

dents a n d a r c a l l o w e d to stay so long as
they d o not p o s e a threat t o Britain's
security a n d are not involved in plotting
acts o f terrorism abroad. The refusal o f
the Foreign Office to c o m m e n t o n the sit-

deliberately unprovocative line to prevent
