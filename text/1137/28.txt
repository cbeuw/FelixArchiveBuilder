"Come weary traveller - sit by t h e fire a n d
rest a n d I will tell y o u stories o f t h e
dreaded g a m e s drought o f 99 a n d h o w
our beloved G a m e s Editor saved his p e o -
ple with the g a m e called Baldur's Gate."
Blimey, a n e w g a m e . S o m e t h i n g o f a
radical c h a n g e in policy for t h e g a m e s
page w e know, but here at Felix w e have
never b e e n afraid to take such leaps o f
faith. Baldur's Gate w a s released back in
January, a c c o m p a n i e d by a lack o f p u b -
licity that m a d e H o w a r d H u g h e s s e e m
like a m e d i a h o g .
Usually t h e a c r o n y m RPG is e n o u g h
to send a g o o d fifty percent o f PC gamers
scurrying for cover (well especially t h e
ones w h e r e RPG means Rocket Propelled
Grenade, or is that just m y paranoia kick-
ing in - G a m e s Ed). After all RPG is all
about p e o p l e staying u p for three days
and nights solid a n d eating pot n o o d l e s
with five or six similar-minded individuals.
W h e n they d o finally e m e r g e in t h e light
they look pasty, b e m u s e d a n d t e n d to
stand in front o f doors for a very l o n g
time because they haven't f o u n d t h e
magical A m u l e t o f G o r i d i d i u m or don't
have t h e necessary dwarven rune. They
are the trainspotters o f the g a m i n g world,
o b s e s s e d with hit points, c h a r a c t e r s
classes a n d n o t e b o o k s full o f h i e r o -
glyphics that c o u l d h a v e c o m e f r o m
Bletchley Park during the war. They are
also partaking in o n e of the oldest forms
of m o d e r n g a m i n g , o n e that w a s estab-
lished long before anyone thought about
using the PC as a g a m e s m a c h i n e , a n d
as such deserve far more
| ยง | respect than they are
often s h o w n , including
by m c just n o w .
Baldur's Gate h a s

junction with TSR, o w n -

tion o f t h o s e g a m i n g
rules. That's s o m e t h i n g
I can't c o m m e n t o n - I've
never played a D & D board g a m e - but if
that's t h e case, t h e n the d e v e l o p e r s
(Bioware) have d o n e a very g o o d j o b o f
m a k i n g s o m e e x t r e m e l y c o m p l i c a t e d
rules eminently ignorable. Basically, if
y o u don't want to read through the rules
section at t h e back o f the manual, y o u
don't n e e d to - t h e g a m e will work every-
thing out for y o u a n d won't get in the
w a y while d o i n g it.
Baldur's Gate o p e n s in a land that is
b e g i n n i n g to c o m e apart at t h e seams -
the major cities in the region are turning
against e a c h other, a n d there are
rumours of nasty things lurking in the sur-
r o u n d i n g countryside. Y o u play a little
pipsqueak o f a n orphan, befriended by
a w i z a r d (or m a g e to use the correct ter-
m i n o l o g y ) . O n e day, as y o u play
a m o n g s t t h e chickens, h e calls for y o u
and takes you o n a journey. En route y o u
are waylaid by a couple of ogres, a witch,
a n d a mysteri-
ous character
e n c a s e d in
armour. After
a swift but
b l o o d y fight,
your m e n t o r
lies b l e e d i n g
o n t h e
g r o u n d a n d
y o u are in
e v e r y s e n s e
o f t h e w o r d ,
alone.
From that
point o n you are more or B
less left to your o w n s p
devices. D u r i n g your J*
travels y o u will pick up | | | | |
various quests - in fact fiT
m
this is the b a c k b o n e o f
the g a m e , as y o u travel
around d o i n g things for fPt||
p e o p l e a n d picking u p
rewards in e x c h a n g e .
Every n o w a n d then y o u
will m e e t a character
w h o will c o m e with y o u
for a while, leaving either
because they are d e a d , or because y o u
are d e a d , or because they w a n t to g o
a n d d o s o m e t h i n g different f r o m w h a t
y o u w a n t to. There arc all t h e usual
races y o u expect to find in this kind o f
g a m e s , h u m a n s , dwarves, elves, half-
ings, ores, wolves, ogres, a n d s o o n .
S o m e o f these will try a n d h e l p y o u ,
s o m e o f these will try a n d kill y o u , a n d
s o m e will just stand a r o u n d all day talk-
ing about the weather. There is a plot-
line (something about t h e o r p h a n b e i n g
the only t h i n g s t a n d i n g b e t w e e n t h e
forces o f chaos a n d order) but y o u c a n
completely ignore this a n d g o off d o i n g
your o w n t h i n g if y o u like.
It's eminently playable, a n d Bioware
have c h o s e n m o r e traditional t o p d o w n
isometric m a p s for t h e graphics rather
than the currently fashionable first person
approach. II works very well, a l t h o u g h
personally I w o u l d have liked t h e ability
to shrink t h e
screen a bit;
it s e e m s a bit
daft for t h e
characters to
be a b l e t o
s e e further
than y o u c a n
- every n o w
a n d a g a i n
y o u g o off to
d o s o m e -
t h i n g a n d
c o m e back t o
find yourself
in t h e m i d d l e o f a battle with half of your
group dead. The control m e t h o d is beau-
tifully simple, c o m p l e t e l y driven by t h e
m o u s e , a n d is extremely easy to pick
up. M y only other gripe is t h e s o u n d ,
a n d in particular t h e s a m p l e d voices.
Ihey have got a lorry-load o f third-rate
A m e r i c a n actors in a n d told t h e m t o
attempt regional British accents. D o y o u
r e m e m b e r Sean Connery's Brooklyn Irish
accent in t h e Untouchables? This is far
m o r e irritating.
The gameplay is compelling, but also
very hard - e v e n o n t h e easiest setting.
Get into the habit o f saving regularly - it's
incredibly frustrating to have half-an-
hours w o r t h o f play w i p e d out because
y o u s p o k e to t h e w r o n g person in a bar.
It's an indication o f just h o w c o m p e l l i n g
this g a m e is that I kept g o i n g back w h e r e
usually w h e n faced with s o m e t h i n g like
this I'd either give u p a n d g o a n d watch
telly or hunt a r o u n d for s o m e cheat
c o d e s .
I'm not sure that this g a m e is g o i n g
to e n d u p a classic. It is h o w e v e r a very
playable product, a n d ( d u e to the close
links with TSR) s h o u l d have as m u c h in it
for previous A D & D players as for b e g i n -
ners. It could e v e n tempt m e into join-
ing t h e serried ranks o f RPG addicts,
a l t h o u g h I positively absolutely u n q u e s -
tionably refuse to start eating pot n o o -
dles. They are t h e junk f o o d o f the devil
a n d that w a y m a d n e s s lies.
