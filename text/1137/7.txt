Cynical Conscience
D a v i d H a w k i n s ' letter raises s e v e r a l
important points. T h e ' y o u t h ' o f t o d a y
are often s e e n , p r o b a b l y q u i t e rightly,
as a cynical lot. W e are quick to criticise,
nihilistic, disillusioned with t h e w o r l d as
w e find it, dismissive o f W e s t e r n values
yet at t h e s a m e t i m e t o o a p a t h e t i c t o
c h a n g e ourselves or t h e w o r l d w e live
in. W e live o u r lives uttering s u c h great
p h r a s e s o f self-praise a s ' I ' m a sur-
vivor.' N i c e o n e . Great a c h i e v e m e n t -

Not all o f us are like this. N o t all o f
us think like this. There is plenty that can
be d o n e , that w e can d o . Consider t h e
traffic problem in L o n d o n . I don't k n o w
m u c h about local government , the tax
system or in fact politics in general, but
it s e e m s to m e there's several ways for-
ward...
A toll for people entering L o n d o n at
the M 2 5 or s o m e other boundary and/or
a tax o n business carparks could raise
e n o u g h m o n e y t o revitalise L o n d o n ' s
public transport system, as well as dis-
couraging people f r o m using their cars.
The counter argument to this is that it'll
be bad for London's businesses (mostly
those in the City - o h dear, h o w upset a m
I). The cost to businesses, however, could
be passed o n as w a g e cuts, or c o u l d
simply e n c o u r a g e c o m p a n i e s t o m o v e
out o f London.
I disagree. S o m e b u s i n e s s e s m a y
leave London, yes. M o s t o f t h e big com-

panies that o c c u p y the square mile a n d
associated areas are unlikely t o move,
however - they need to be near the pulse
of t h e City.
Finally, I w o u l d have thought that
most c o m p a n i e s w o u l d a p p l a u d a n y
s c h e m e to discourage drivers in London.
Putting pollution issues aside for t h e
m o m e n t , current surveys s h o w that t h e
fastest m e a n s o f transport in L o n d o n is
the bicycle. T h e n m o t o r b i k e s a n d
m o p e d s . Then t h e u n d e r g r o u n d , which
ties with taxis during many periods of the
day. Then w e have buses a n d cars, a n d
even these can s o m e t i m e s be beaten by
foot. All that's without the investment in
cycle lanes and paths, underground trains
a n d stations, a n d bus lanes, that a toll or
tax f u n d e d s c h e m e could provide.
M a y b e I'm a dreamer, a n idealist,
whatever. M a y b e the carbon m o n o x i d e
f u m e s a n d l o w frequency high decibel
noise that lines the Cromwell Road every
m o r n i n g w h e n I walk into college from
Earls Court has got the better o f m e .
M a y b e I'm unrealistic to h o p e for a city
In w h i c h lorries don't hurtle past my bed-
r o o m w i n d o w every ten minutes all night
long, causing the double glazing to rever-
berate. M a y b e I'm just too cynical.
W e can m a k e a difference. For the
sake o f m y sanity, c a m p a i g n against red
routes (those r e d lines o n roads l o
increase traffic flow) a n d for better pub-
lic transport. W e have a voice, a n d w e
have a vote. Talking o f which, m a k e sure
y o u u s e yours today.
