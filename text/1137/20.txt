t has l o n g b e e n k n o w n that Robin
Williams films divide neatly u p into
two c a m p s - w o r t h y a n d b e a r d y
(Good Will Hunting, Dead Poets Society
The Fisher King), a n d s h o w b o a t i n g
(Aladdin, Good Morning Vietnam,
Hook, Mrs Doubtfire) - a n d never t h e
twain shall meet. Right? N o t necessarily,
because Patch Adams attempts to c o m -
bine every k n o w n Williams e l e m e n t
under t h e s u n . Thus, h e ' s grandstand-
ing o n e m i n u t e a n d d e w y e y e d t h e next
- plus h e q u o t e s poetry, w e a r s silly cos-
tumes, overacts (hideously, b u t hilari-
ously), a n d tries t o c h a n g e t h e w o r l d .
O h , a n d h e ' s got a beard. S o m e o f t h e
time.
The other key factor to his career is
the a m a z i n g w a y in w h i c h h e flies f r o m
critical acclaim to utter disaster - for e x a m -
ple, his brilliant p e r f o r m a n c e in Good
Will Hunting c a m e o n t h e back o f painful-
to-watch roles in both Flubber a n d Jack.
Consequently it s h o u l d c o m e as n o sur-
prise that, having suffered t h e i g n o m i n y
that w a s What Dreams May Come just a
couple o f m o n t h s ago, he's back o n t o p
f o r m . I n d e e d , t h e role is so R o b i n
Williams that It's barely p o s s i b l e t o
Beard - worthy; No beard - funny. Simple, huh?
believe that it's really a true story...
...Which leads us nicely to the plot,
w h e r e i n Williams plays the role o f the
e p o n y m o u s Patch A d a m s , w h o , having
left his self-imposed spell in a psychi-
atric hospital, d e c i d e s t o enter M e d
School. But (surprise surprise), he's not
at all happy with t h e system, a n d h e
rebels against t h e style o f doctor-patient
relationship taught by G u n t o n . H e
prefers a m o r e e m o t i o n a l attachment,
a n d the opportunity to make the patients
feel better, through a n a m a z i n g line in
slapstick and general Robin Williams style
buffoonery. As I said before, it's a role so
perfect for h i m that it's hard t o believe
it's true.
OK, so occasionally It's fairly obvious
that Williams h a s s l i p p e d free a n d is
improvising at will, but so what - h e is,
after all, o n e o f the most gifted comics
of his generation. N o , the bigger issue is
the g r a t i n g s e n t i m e n t a l i t y w h i c h is
d r a g g e d o u t o f every possible scene,
a n d t h e massive s u s p e n s i o n o f disbelief
required t o accept that M o n i c a Potter
(Martha meet Frank, Daniel and Lau-
rence) c o u l d possibly e n d u p falling for
a d e r a n g e d o l d m a n like Williams.
In t h e e n d , however, these prob-
lems pale into insignificance - t h e stan-
dard d o w n s i d e o f a n y Robin Williams
feature. C o n s e q u e n t l y , w h a t ' s left is
s o m e t h i n g w h i c h , whilst far from bril-
liant ( a n d , i n d e e d , far f r o m Williams'
best) is n o n e t h e l e s s a n e n g a g i n g , heart-
w a r m i n g story - m a d e all t h e m o r e spe-
cial thanks t o its real-life basis. Patch
A d a m s himself is the real star - and you're
left in w o n d e r that it's taken thirty years
for t h e story o f such a n a m a z i n g m a n to
c o m e to light. Q

Affliction • • •
Starring : Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Sissy Spacek, Willem Dafoe
Director: Paul Schrader
A
small t o w n w h e r e n o t h i n g s b i g
s e e m s t o h a p p e n sets t h e s c e n e
for Affliction. W a d e W h i t e h o u s e ,
Nick Nolte, is t h e sole police officer in
this t o w n , a m e r e figure h e a d in a vil-
lage that has little crime. His life is lit-
tered with tragedy a b r o k e n marriage,
m e m o r i e s o f a n abusive c h i l d h o o d a n d
a n a g g i n g t o o t h a c h e . N o t h i n g s e e m s
to b e g o i n g his w a y until h e s e e s a
c h a n c e f o r r e d e m p t i o n a n d r e c o g n i -
tion. W h e n a w e e k e n d h u n t e r dies
under mysterious c i r c u m s t a n c e s W a d e
sees a c o n s p i r a c y a n d a cover-up.
Believing that o n c e h e u n c o v e r s all t h e
sordid details his life will take a turn for
the better, h e in fact starts t o alienate
himself t h r o u g h his wild accusations.
H o w e v e r w i t h o u t solving t h e little n a g -
g i n g things in his life a n alter e g o starts
to take f o r m w h i c h ultimately leads
him to paranoia.
Affliction is a clever film, pulling o n
every viewer's curiosity a n d desire for a
conspiracy f r o m this p o s s i b l e m u r d e r .
I'm no expert, but I don't think he's at all well.
This over-active i m a g i n a t i o n is t h e cata-
lyst for W a d e ' s s l o w a n d painful fall into
his father's footsteps: a father's alco-
holism a n d v i o l e n c e w h i c h is ultimately
passed to his s o n . The film is not violent
but t h e apparent mental discomfort aris-
ing f r o m t h e acting is extremely vivid.
W a d e ' s father played by J a m e s C o b u r n
portrays a c o n v i n c i n g senile alcoholic,
w h o still abuses his s o n mentally despite
his old a g e . Nolte's, o n t h e other h a n d ,
s h o w s that h e is definitely a n underated
actor: as his character drifts into alco-
h o l i s m a n d v i o l e n c e N o l t e starts to
mimic his father's traits, a n d this is w h e n
y o u start to realise t h e path t h e film is
taking.
This film w o n ' t a p p e a l to everyone:
its bleak o u t l o o k o n o n e man's life a n d
the inevitable 'like father, like s o n ' story
leaves y o u uneasy, h o w e v e r this film is
c e n t r e d o n t h e c h a r a c t e r s ' affliction
rather than t h e solution. The sparse nar-
ration b y W i l l e m D a f o e is a w e l c o m e
relief as h e essentially explains t o t h e
a u d i e n c e w h a t h a s h a p p e n e d a n d what
d o e s h a p p e n to o u r unfortunate char-
acter. What m a k e s Affliction m e m o r a b l e
is t h e w a y t h e story w e a v e s t h r o u g h
this tale, w h i l e subtly h i d i n g t h e real
plot, letting it slowly c o m e to t h e surface
t o w a r d s t h e finale. Q
