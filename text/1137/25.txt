p r o d u c e d by Earth Love Fund

raise funds for h e l p i n g t h e victims o f
the s e v e r e h u r r i c a n e s that struck
Central A m e r i c a about t w o m o n t h s ago.
ELF Records arc c o n c e r n e d a b o u t envi-
r o n m e n t a l issues with particular
e m p h a s i s o n t h e d i s a p p e a r i n g rain-
forests a r o u n d t h e g l o b e .
In total there are nineteen tracks spread
over t h e t w o C D s a n d c o n t r i b u t i o n s
c o m e f r o m t h e likes o f Massive Attack,
Fatboy Slim, U n d e r w o r l d a n d Banco D e
Gaia. Kicking off with the first CD, y o u are
presented with a variety o f s o u n d s rang-
ing f r o m a m b i e n t trance with Banco D e
Gaia's 'Drunk A s A M o n k ' t o b i g beat
m a d n e s s in B R A ' S ' W h y Is A Frog l o o ' . It
w o u l d b e easy but tedious to list all the
artists o n here a n d that w o u l d probably
be e n o u g h t o convince y o u to b u y t h e
a l b u m . Instead I'll just m e n t i o n s o m e o f
the best a n d worst tracks
Massive Attack's 'Protection' is a n apt
start to t h e a l b u m providing a n d atmos-
pheric a n d m o o d y feel that pervades
t h r o u g h o u t t h e entire record. Trancey
s o u n d s are popular, the music choice of
'eco warriors', with artists such as Astrala-
sia a n d Electric Skychurch. There are a
c o u p l e o f w e a k tracks i n c l u d i n g 'The
Bug' by Face O n Mars a n d U2's ' M o f o ' ,
but d e s p i t e s o m e r a n d o m fillers t h e
a l b u m holds it o w n overall. C o n s i d e r i n g
the fact that this is a d o u b l e C D a n d also
that your m o n e y is g o i n g towards a g o o d
cause, this a l b u m is definitely well worth
c h e c k i n g out. CI

7 No Name, w h i c h is
more average than a red Astra, is not
appreciated.
Ihe style o f t h e a l b u m is sort o f
world music, often with lyrics in unrec-
ognizable foreign languages, a n d beats
that lead it d o w n an easy listening d r u m
and bass path. This f o r m u l a s o u n d s like
a recipe for disaster, but it's by no means
that interesting. N o tracks stand out as
particularly g o o d , a n d none: as particu-
larly b a d As I said before it's average,
and as it's a dance music compilation,
of which there: are already far too many,
there's really n o point to it
Ihe only thing I could get possibly
emotional about o n this a l b u m is t h e
title. Music with No Njmc is a phrase
that s o u n d s like a title the compilers
d e c i d e d u p o n u h e n they couldn't think
of anything better. The a f o r e m e n t i o n e d
Red Astra w o u l d have b e e n a great
c h o i c e , or e v e n Carling Black l a b e l
Aston .Martin or Stella Artois w o u l d ha\e
b e e n totally inapt.
Llectric Melt, v o u must Irv harder.
