ICU President
Andy Swift
You have spoken of disaffiliation from
ULU. Could you Justify the costs of oper-
ating outside this realm given the loss of
discounts and suchlike?
OK, basically, ULU; I believe that Imperial
College should be a major player in U L U .
I believe that as President I should be
involved in actively developing a n d re-
organising ULU in to the next century. Peo-
ple may say that ULU is a waste o f money.
O n the sporting side o f things - if w e
were to disaffiliate from U L U (hen w e
would lose all our sporting fixtures against
major colleges, and these are s o m e of the
key games w e look forward to. It's the rep-
resentation of the students as well that's
important. With U L U w e n e e d to have a
voice for the students of London, basically
- if Imperial College were to go it alone w e
w o u l d lose out o n so m u c h . Currently
there is an issue with London Transport
and this would never have been raised
with the sole backing of Imperial College.
What d o y o u t h i n k o f the n e w expansion
plans o f Imperial to Include other col-
leges?
I feel lhat expanding Imperial College to
encapsulate W y e College, which is the
issue you're raising there, is good because
it provides anothet angle, it brings more
students into Ihe college. As for the organ-
isational aspect, I believe that it shouldn't
be too m u c h o f a problem to bring these?
students in. It's in a similar situation to Sil-
w o o d Park, a n d as president it will be for
me to organise it in such a way that these
people don't feel isolated. I k n o w from
personal experience, as captain of the
football club, that people from Silwood
Park d o feel isolated. I have tried to bring
their footballing team together with IC this
year - it's kind o f this communication that's
very important.
You spoke o f being football club captain
- there were several tribunals last year
that y o u were In s o m e w a y Involved In;
what have y o u learnt from this experience
and h o w have y o u changed in order to
prepare yourself for being President?
last year I was captain of the fourths'
team, and I was involved with a disciplinaa
hearing, which w e were given communiK
service for. This year, as club captain, the
football club's disciplinary record has been
spotless so that every player has enjoy-
ment without stepping over that line that
is d e e m e d irresponsible.
What w o u l d y o u propose to d o about
this big medic/non-medic split that's going
o n at Imperial, that's so obvious to first
years?
O K -1 understand medical people have a
six year course that takes u p a lot o f
time a n d they are different in m a n y
ways to IC students. I said tonight that
I'm w o u l d c a m p a i g n for t h e m to have
their o w n sabbatical w h o w o u l d be able
to address their issues to U n i o n Coun-.
cil w h i c h I think is very important.

I notice that you intend to get some dis-
counts through your tenure. It has been
made clear that Dave Hellard is already
doing running an extensive campaign to
Institute this sort of scheme already. How
do you Intend to develop on this?
There are a lot of companies that Dave has
gone for which in general d o student dis-
counts anyway. I'll be trying to g o for more
local companies that are around the South
Kensington campus, and also the Charing
Ooss and St Mary's campus, which Dave has-
n't handled so far.
So what was your incentive In running for a
sabbatical position? Some people may
assume ifs for CV points...
That's the thing. I'm not really going for CV
points here. As far as I'm concerned, If I take
the year out it's a heavy commitment to the
Union. If I want to g o and get a job I should
hope I could get a good job from my acad-
emic record, and earn a good salary. Ifs not
that I'm doing this for CV points - because I
think that my CV is already quite good.
Referring back,to your manifesto, you want
to persist with hybrid entry. H o w do you
Intend to reopen the Issue and be success-
ful?
firstly I would like to point out that a lot of
medics that are n o w a part of our college
applied to different colleges, they applkxj it)
St Marys school of medicine and Charing
Cross medical school. I think it is grossly
unfair that you should expect them, just
because there was a merger, to be consid-
ered IC students - a lot of them dont con-
sider themsokes to be IC stuck ;nts. I hey con-
sider themsek es to be of their respected col
leges. I really d o think that you should not
create bad feeling for those people I a m for
integration - in the long run, there is a merger
process that's taking place, and in the: long
run I do want single entry, so I think Imper-
ial College teams should be the best teams
w e can put out. At Ihis critical moment w e
are in the middle of a merger -1 want to
make it as painless as possible for the med-
ical students because: I do not want to cre-
ate bad feeling a m o n g I h c m
But h o w do you Intend to g o up against
BUSA when the Issue's already dosed?
\othing Is set in stone. Nothing nothing ever
is - it's all politics. It's how you deal with the
Issue. If there arc enough medics that say
w e want dual entry, it'll push them in that
direction. Obviously BUSA has an agenda -
they want single entry at a certain date. I think
we should try and resist that as much as pos-
sible lo make sure that the medical schools
take this merger as long as possible, so that
the people in higher years don't have bad
feelings.
You said in your manifesto that you have had
previous experience in Union dubs and
positions. What are these and w h y do you
thinkthey have prepared you for being Pres-
ident?
I've been a part of the Union finance Com-
mittee, I was heavily Involved in STOIC last
year, and I was quite crucial in establishing
its suivival.
Ben Polounovsky,
We'd like to know two quantifiable policies
that you would Introduce If you were voted
In next year.
Well, I'd like, for a start, to make the Union a
more quantifiable place. I would like to
make a change in the Union o n friday nights
because they seem to be very m u c h
reserved to be the same kinds of music, ori-
entated to the same type of people. So I was
hoping that shows like the b o m b could be
put on a Friday night or allocated a longer
time. I think the election campaign system
is too bureaucratic, with too many rules. It's
not surprising that so f e w students vote
w h e n there is only t w o weeks of cam-
paigning and the size of the posters are so
limited.
Do you feel that the Union Is cosmopolitan,
thatthere Is enough Integration In the Unjg|l|
If not how sould you draw on your back-
ground to Indude people from all cultures at
Imperial college In student life?
I think it's definitely not mixed enough.
Because half the population of Imperial col-
lege is from overseas I think w e should inte-
grate their cultures to make a freindler place
for al! people. To make the college more cos-
mopolitan, I think w e should celebrate other
cultural events in the Union, for example Chi-
nese n e w year and Eeid, as well as the tra-
ditional christian events such as Christmas and
Easter.
Both for home and international students,
h o w would you ease the burden of iMng In
London?
I 'i 'Iops II itn iducing cheaper phono calls tc >
loii ion companies; arranging with travel
n )inii â€¢ (I i|itickets. W e d o h a v e q u i l e
i heap tic ki I \ ilh SIA travel, although they
ml always Ihe most student Ireiondlv
bodies (hey tend to be a bit bitchy from time
to time. I've had trouble with them myself.
People who don't live in London should def-
initely get cheaper train tickets, I have: a friend
who can't go home more than every Two
weeks because it is so expensive.
What roles do you see as the roles the Con-
stituent College Unions (CCU) play while
you're in the Union office?
It's for communication with the students
themselves. I would like the Unions to have
more control cover the departments and be
able to influence the contents of the courses
and h o w they are conveyed to the students.
The CCU would be the main channel of c o m
munication which would gather everything
that is wrong eith the courses and pass the
information on the; the Union, so w e would
actually be able to act o n the issues raised.
What do you think Is your key to success?
I'm very different f r o m t h e other can-
didates. I believe m o r e in acting, that
the m a n d o e s t h e j o b , not his knowl-
e d g e . .
