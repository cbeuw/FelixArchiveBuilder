United DJs of America Vol. II
'My First CD': compiled and mixed by
Cevln Fisher
With a c o u p l e of recent hits b e h i n d
him, Cevin Fisher is b i g n e w s o n the
dance s c e n e at the m o m e n t . So, fol-
lowing o n f r o m the success of hits such
as 'The Freaks C o m e Out', Fisher has
brought out a mix a l b u m . It features thir-
teen racks of d e e p u n d e r g r o u n d h o u s e
music i n c l u d i n g Studio 54's 'Freak It',
House of 909's 'Beautiful Day' a n d Cevin
Fisher's 'The Freaks C o m e Out'. Superbly
mixed, each track follows the previous
one really well instead of t h e m b e i n g just
chucked together in any old order. Cevin
Fisher has obviously taken his t i m e over
this album, selecting only the best music
and m a k i n g sure it all fits together. He'll
be one to watch out for this year, and the
album (out soon) will also be o n e to
watch out for. A n absolute must.

m a n Jay
T h e r e are so m a n y c o m p i l a t i o n
a l b u m s b e i n g released by clubs these
days, that m a n y p e o p l e don't give a toss
a n y m o r e . If y o u w a n t to d o well in this
market then y o u have to release s o m e -
thing a bit different. So is this a l b u m ,
released by the g l a m s u p e r c l u b M i s s
M o n e y p e n n y ' s , that little bit different?
Well, N o . Alright, it's mixed by N o r m a n
Jay, but there is n o t h i n g on this a l b u m
w h i c h makes it stand out The tracks are
just t h e b o g s t a n d a r d stuff M o n -
eypenny's play. It c o m e s in two CDs - CD
1 features h o u s e a n d garage music (cur-
rent as well as past tunes) with C D 2 fea-
t u r i n g the " G o o d G r o o v e s M i x " - a
collection of s o u n d s from all over the
music world. Out of the two, the second
C D is a little better, but as an overall pack-
a g e it's n o t h i n g to shout about.

Single o f the W e e k
Jimi Tenor
'Year o f the Apocalypse'
A couple of w e e k s ago w e reviewed
Jimi Tenor's rather superb a l b u m O r g a n -
ism'. In M a r c h , he releases the breath-
taking 'Year of the Apocalypse', a very
uplifting and melodic track. This is a track
which s o u n d s like a bit of a garage tune,
but at the same time has chilled, melodic
sounds. The beat is simple and the tune
is catchy a n d the singer must be praised
for m a n a g i n g to sing 'Year of the A p o c -
alypse' in the chorus. The 12" c o m e s
with a couple of mixes, each different to
the other (one b e i n g a bit m o r e vocal),
a n d a s e c o n d , separate track. D o i n g
well in the Coolcuts Chart, this m a k e s
great listening.

The Four Usual Suspects
'1999'
In a w o r d , this single is bollocks.
Surely there is a regulatory b o d y to stop
crap like this b e i n g p r o d u c e d . The four
Usual Suspects, including Roger Sanchez
a n d A n g i e Johnson, have r e p r o d u c e d
1999 as a dance version of Prince's clas-
sic tune, a n d completely m u r d e r e d it.
A n g i e Johnson excels in s i n g i n g c o m -
pletely out of sync with the tune, whilst
the rest of the four give the single "a n e w
h o u s e vibe". What the hell is g o i n g o n
here? It's not m e a n t to be a f " * * * g
d a n c e t u n e . C o m e s w i t h loads o f
remixes, each as bad as the others a n d
completely indistinguishable. This is a
superb example of s o m e o n e taking a
great classic, a n d turning it into a feeble
dance track for c o m m e r c i a l gain. Avoid.
Sundance
The Living Dream'
This is the k i n d a t u n c you'll either
really love or really hate. Following o n
from their national chart success with
'Sundance' (the e p o n y m o u s l y titled sin-
gle), S u n d a n c e have released their n e w
single 'The Living Dream'. Full of cheesy
beats, vocals, pianos a n d breakdowns,
this is typical Euro h o u s e music, but it's
so bloody catchy y o u can't help h u m -
m i n g a l o n g . It c o m e s with half a d o z e n
mixes over a c o u p l e of CD's. S o m e of
the mixes s o u n d the s a m e (odd that!)
whilst the Transa remix is a completely
different tune in itself.

G u r m
D o n n a D e e
' H o o k e d '
( M e c c a Recordings)
This is a strange record. The A-sides
are g o o d funky garage with plenty of
chunky beats. Not too m e m o r a b l e really,
but still worth a listen if y o u are a garage
fiend. However, it's the B-side remix of
" H o o k e d " w h i c h really d o e s it for me. It's
up-beat house, a n d wouldn't be out of
place in o n e of Judge Jules' sets. Nice
break-downs a n d build-ups a d d e d to an
infective tune m a k e this o n e to look out
for.
