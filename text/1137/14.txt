Ian Clifford
In your manifesto you stated that you
want Union training for various Union
members. What areas need to be
strengthened?
I'm principally talking about training
for treasurers because it's important that
treasurers know the financial regulations.
There have b e e n a lot o f problems this
year with the U n i o n clubs and in particu-
lar the medical clubs because they simply
haven't k n o w n what the regulations are
and what the Union's rules are regarding
payments and getting m o n e y back. So a
lot of, for example, medical clubs have
found that they haven't got the m o n e y
because n o b o d y k n e w they'd paid it in.
What kind of financial experience do you
have?
I a m currently the treasurer of the City
a n d Guilds College Union. As treasurer I
have to deal with a lot of matters con-
cerning the clubs of C&GU, the depart-
mental societies, the Motor Club, the
Karting section, the Rugby Club, and in
such respect I have to know the ins and
outs of the Union. I have also worked in
the Union so I have s o m e idea of the
m o n e y that goes through the Union a n d
the services it provides.
A point of tecent contention has been the
Art Society's subsidised trips. What's your
stance o n this a n d what are y o u g o i n g t o
d o about it?
People have a lot of contention about
the Arts Society simply because; people
feel that it's unfair that they should get a
large amount of money for their members
to g o o n trips, whereas members of other
societies have g o n e o n trips a n d found
that they haven't got m o n e y for the
events. I feel that as a sock tty that is specif-
ically aimed at funding appreciation of the
arts, they should get s o m e iunding, but I
also feel that they should aim for s o m e
kind o f external funding, either in spon-
sorship or in reductions from the thio-
ls there anything that you would do to
dramatically change the money allotment
system?
There arc a lot of things y o u could
possibly do. At the m o m e n t I haven't got
any dramatic changes planned, possibly
looking more at what the clubs aim to do.
They should really try and bid and say
"we've d o n e this this a n d this, and w e
intend to do this in the future." That way,
you can say where a club is going. A lot
of clubs arc o n the verge of closing or just
tinkering over - it is important to see that
people have got vision. If people have got
vision then clubs can g o far - it's not just
the fact that clubs are doing things that is
important.
Do you Intend to wear a skirt every day if
you get the Job?
No, I don't! ^
Paul Hickman
You want a stricter enforcement of the
subsidy rules for clubs and societies.
Which clubs are you referring to specifi-
cally, and how do you intend to address
these Issues?
I don't really want to give specific
examples, but I w a s trying to make the
point that the rules are there because
there's only so m u c h m o n e y to g o
around, and I want to make sure that
everyone gets a fair crack of the whip, and
gets the m o n e y that they deserve. Obvi-
ously there may be exceptional circum-
stances, but that's w h a t the capital
expenditure fund is for.
How do you see your role in supporting
the president and other sabbaticals?
I'm not really sure what you're asking,
I'm there to be responsible to the presi-
dent for finances a n d services, but If the
other sabbaticals have got anv questions
to do with finances and services, then I'll
be there to help them as needed.
Do you feel that the current Union ser-
vices are adequate for the students' needs
or are there any gaps and, if so, how do
you intend to fill them?
Gaps... difficult to say, really. I'm hop-
ing that the results of the focus groups that
arc occurring at the moment will tell m e
whether there are any gaps that need to be
addressed and, if so, I'll try and look at fill-
ing them if possible. It may be that the ser-
vices people want just aren't affordable.
But on those focus groups we under-
stand that you feel you've been hard
done by - one Union official has In fact
stolen your Idea
1 wouldn't say stolen my idea - to
have stolen it he would have had to ha\ e
known I had it It was an idea I had in mind
w h e n I was thinking about standing, it just
happened that I was beaten to it - which
is good. The Union is trying to provide the;
services people want and listen to what
people want.
What financial experience do you have
and how will you apply your knowledge?
I understand what the Union financial
regulations are. I did get caught out at the
hustings o n o n e question, but I think that
was more mental block o n stage than
anything else: I knew then answer and was
quite upset that I caught out. I know how
the finances work, but I haven't actually
been a club treasurer, I'll be honest on that,
but I do know what the rules and regula-
tions are around the Union, and I believe
I can help people to understand them.
Do you feel that financial resources are
freely accessible to students at the
moment?
I believe most clubs get a fair subsidy
from the budgeting round, but obviously
as DPtF&S) I w o u l d be o n the budget
advisory group and UFC to help make sure
that if people d o have a specific need we
can sort out that problem.
