MENS
IC III 2-0 KCL II
This has b e e n a lean season for IC thirds so
far, so 2 wins in a day was pretty welcome.
W e w e r e s u p p o s s e d to by playing St
Georges III in the BUSA plate, but having
b e e n thrashed 8-1 by the sixths last week,
they decided a 5-0 walkover w a s the last
result they would get. So the thirds ease into
the Quarter finals. Luckily, w e ' d also
arranged to play KCL II (always a g o o d idea
to have a spare opposition lying around) -
w h o were a tougher proposition.
But the thirds are starting to play some
decent football. Tony and Paul took control
in midfield, a n d even the defence w a s
solid, earning the long-suffering Ricky his
first clean sheet of the season. Upfront, Ole
then Dave converted 2 quality 2 quality
crosses from felix - if it hadn't been for
s o m e excellent saves by their keeper (and
s o m e feeble finishing), it would have been
6. Playing with passions a n d purpose, the
Thirds are a match for anyone - on this form,
relegation won't be an issue. Winning BUSA
might.
ICIV2- 2 Wye College
After a recent run of bad form, w e were
expecting to turn it around in this game,
unfortunately, this assumption w a s not
valid under these circumstances, as w e
once again underestimated our opposi-
tion. The g a m e started with a n onslaught
by them, but w h e n w e eventually managed
to put our foot o n the ball, w e broke with
the speed of Daley Thompson. The ball was
crossed by Aidan "I'm in a band" Banks and
as Gurm "Owen without the strength" Mar-
w a h a received the ball h e w a s cruelly
brought down by a sluggish Wye defender.
Ricki " A d a m " Butcher calmly finished
from the spot, but then Wye retaliated with
a goal almost immediately after the kick-off.
Blame must lie with the captain w h o w a s
too slow to close h i m d o w n . Too many
beers this year perhaps? Just before half-
time they scored again from a corner - one
of our weaknesses.
After a stern teamtalk from captain
Elliot "Didn't get any Valentines" Newsome,
w e came out in the second half promising
to just enjoy one o f our final games of the
season. This s e e m e d to work, as w e were
quickly o n top of the game, a n d w h e n
Ricki equalised w e thought w e could go o n
to win it. However, W y e matched our extra
effort despite strong play f r o m Steven
"Does h e ever g o out" Dewar, Chris "Large
Donner" Tzinieris and Peyrouz "Well hard"
Modarrnes. Even with the introduction of
S i m o n "Scandale" N e w t o n , Fred "Garlic
Bread" Gelloz a n d Rola "Bola" Bola into
the game, the final score was a fair 2-2 draw.
Winning the league is n o w surely out
of our grasp - but promotion is still a pos-
sibility.
INTER-DEPARTMENTAL
Elec Eng A 4 - 3 Mech Eng B
After just about managing to form a team
and turning-up o n e w e e k and 45 minutes
late, the Sparky's m a n a g e d to spark a win
against the Mechies or in the dying seconds
of the game. There w a s s o m e skillful tack-
ling and graceful passing, not to mention
a little bit of shirt pulling.
Cyril andjual the frenchman scored for
M c c h Eng with Luke, Stephen a n d M r X
scoring for the Sparky's. The g a m e looked
to be in a tight dead-lock at 3-3, certain to
go into the deadly golden goal phase - but
a slip from Arun a n d quick reactions from
Mr X put EE into the next round.
Well d o n e to EE and M e c h Eng, w h o
still played despite being fatigued from
their o w n game. If you are interested in
