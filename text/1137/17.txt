Quick Guide to S.T.V
I single transferable vote ]
Voting is a complicated busi-
ness, and unless you think care-
fully about exactly what you are
writing on that voting slip, the
entire election may collapse into
complete chaos.
STV works like this:
1. You vote by indicating with a
"1" the candidate of your first
choice, a " 2 " for your second
choice and so on until there are
no more candidates to vote for
or you no longer wish to cast a
vote on the remaining candi-
dates.
2. The votes are counted.
3. If no candidate has won over
50% of the votes, the person
who attained the least votes has
their votes re-allocated.
4. The person with the least voles
is eliminated. O n the ballot
papers where they were first
choice the 2nd choice become
a 1st choice, 3rd becomes 2nd
and so on. The votes are trans-
ferred as if those votes were
being counted again from
scratch, then we go back to point
3 and continue until someone
wins the elections.
