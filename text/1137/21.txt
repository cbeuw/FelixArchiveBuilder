Double Team
Sometimes y o u can see where producers
are c o m i n g from - why they think that cer-
tain movies are worthy o f their invest-
ment, whilst others fall by the wayside.
Sadly, however, Double Team is no such
movie. Pairing u p kickboxing star Jean-
Claude Van D a m m e (long on name, short
o n talent) with NBA bad guy Dennis Rod-
m a n (long o n silly hairstyles, short o n
temper) could only look like a g o o d idea
to the most inebriated o f Hollywood's
finest, surely? Sadly, however, as Holly-
w o o d producers are renowned for any-
thing but sobriety, that's exactly what w c
get. R o d m a n is a n arms dealer; V a n
D a m m e works for a counter-terrorism
unit; they team up to kill the man w h o
murdered Van D a m m e ' s son. You know
the rest. Worth renting for a lads night in
- definitely not worth buying. OK?
Jackie Brown
Jackie Brown, o n the other hand, is a per-
fect example of the kind of movie that any
Hollywood exec w o u l d kill for. Tarantino's
return, after a three year hiatus, waltzed
its way into the box office big league,
despite a minuscule budget (all the stars
w o r k e d for peanuts, just t o have t h e
chance of working with him). Moreover,
by choosing man-of-the-moment Elmore
Leonard (Get Shorty, Out of Sight) for his
source material, he m a d e a safe bet dou-
bly sure. Samuel I. Jackson, Robert De
Niro, Bridget Fonda, P a m Grier a n d
Michael Kcaton all step effortlessly into
carefully crafted roles, and deliver s o m e
classic Tarantino dialogue: "AK-47. W h e n
you absolutely, positively got to kill every
motherfucker in the r o o m . Accept n o
substitutes." N e e d I say more?
Face
Somehow, Robert Carlyle isn't a megastar
yet. I don't understand why though - he's
starred in two of the biggest British movies
of the nineties (Trainspotting, The Full
Monly), alongside an a m a z i n g range of
TV performances. Thus, in Face he once
again pulls out a top notch performance
in an under-written role, leading a group
of Londoners in a bungled heist. The plot
may be formulaic, but the performances
are far from predictable. Underrated and
overlooked first time around, it's time for
lace's second chance. Q
