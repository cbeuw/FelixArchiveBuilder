SEBADOH
The Sebadoh |
Sebadoh, carrying on Nirvana's
name?
m e a n , h o w c h e a p c a n y o u get?
What a m I s u p p o s e d to do? N o case
and n o sleeve equal n o information
in m y book. Alright, they have gener-
ously printed the n a m e of the a l b u m o n
the C D a l o n g with the tracks but c ' m o n ,
throw m e a freakin' b o n e here!
Sebadoh haven't really decided what
style o f music they fit into. Is it alterna-
tive? AOR? G r u n g e (is that d e a d yet)?
Well, u r n , it's all o f t h e a b o v e . A n d
they've got lots to practice o n what with
a w h o l e fifteen tracks o n t h e a l b u m . I
often find that this is a double-edged
sword t h o u g h . You have the conflict o f
quantity a n d quality (do y o u r e m e m b e r
English essays, 'But miss, h o w m u c h d o
w e have t o write?'), but S e b a d o h have
m a n a g e d both aspects rather well.
Call m e jaded but haven't w e heard
this all before? I c a n hear a n early
nineties s o u n d in this a l b u m : t h e dis-
cordant guitars, that hi-hat/ snare d r u m -
m i n g a n d the s o n g s with loud, punchy,
high-energy choruses a n d m o o d y , intro-
spective verses. You c a n hear s o many
other bands in this music. O n Love Is
Stronger y o u have a n early R.E.M. Nick
Of Time Is reminiscent o f a m o r e musi-
cally gifted Jesus Lizard. A n d free w o u l d
s o u n d like Blur's n e w single Tender, if
Blur h a d b o t h e r e d t o write their o w n
stuff and not rip it off the likes o f U2 a n d
Bush.
Bird In The Hand is a n outstanding
track simply because they have the balls
to blatantly take off Nirvana a n d the Pix-
ies in o n e fell s w o o p . Fantastic. So Long
also strikes a chord with m e purely d u e
to the fact that it s h o w s these guys can
rock out, m a n . Indeed.
I guess I'm a bit s t u n n e d . I g e n -
uinely enjoyed listening t o this. Sure,
we've heard most of it before a n d it's not
new, but I like it. Hey, y o u can' play air-
guitar to it for G o d ' s sake. So is this what
Nirvana w o u l d have evolved into if Kurt
hadn't died (mysterious circumstances or
otherwise)? W o u l d w e have s e e n Nir-
v a n a a l o n g with S e b a d o h o n t h e next
friends s o u n d t r a c k ? Adult O r i e n t a t e d

FREDDY FRESH
Last True Family Man
There's something fishy
going on here.
W
hile Fatboy Slim m a y b e Big
Beat's N u m e r o U n o , Freddy
Fresh retains the title for most
prolific mixmaster. This n e w a l b u m
w e i g h s in at a positively anorexic 22
tunes (his earlier Essential Mix total led 2
hours a n d 105 tracks!).
Mr. Fresh follows t h e Big Beat for-
m u l a ( w h i c h h e admittedly h a d a h a n d
in inventing) t o the letter - t h r o w i n g in
scratchy l o o p e d vocals, funky h o o k lines
and h u m u n g o u s beats. Yes it's definitely
speaker melting time!
In order to a d d a bit of variety Freddy
sensibly let his pals contribute a c o u p l e
of tracks. Ironically, these turned out to
be the best o n the a l b u m . Contributors
include The FreeStylers a n d naturally M r .
Slim himself. Freddy s e e m s t o p r o d u c e
his funkiest compositions w h e n w o r k i n g
with other peoples material as a base or
s o m e o n e else to b o u n c e Ideas off.
It is clear that this m a n k n o w s h o w
to wield a sampler, h e even appears to
have e a v e s d r o p p e d o n a c o u p l e o f
p h o n e conversations. If it makes s o u n d ,
Freddy will nick it a n d loop it. Another
highlight is what seems to be his random
tuning o f a South A m e r i c a n radio - mix-
ing static a n d r a n d o m adverts.
Talking o f South A m e r i c a , Freddy
pays his respects t o his Puerto Rican
roots with s o m e Bossa N o v a beats a n d
s a m b a rythms. H e certainly k n o w s h o w
to get a c o n g a g o i n g ! Admittedly, m y
Puerto Rican isn't u p to m u c h but most
of the samples appear to revolve around
the fact that h e is Puerto Rican. This is
proclaimed by various voices, including
the deepest s o u n d i n g voice I have heard
this side of Issac Hayes. This bassy sound-
ing d u d e is featured again in another o f
the top tracks of the a l b u m -Its About The
Groove. N i c e s h .
Ail in all this a l b u m sticks to the rules
a n d p r o d u c e s a funky, latin s o u n d i n g
twist o n t h e b i g beat s o u n d . If you are a
Fresh acolyte this will b e right u p your
street as its m o r e o f t h e same. H o w -
ever, if you are n e w to b i g beat I w o u l d
r e c o m m e n d dipping your t o e in the pool
with a Fatboy Slim a l b u m instead.
Fresh a n d funky but there is better
out there, d Joel
