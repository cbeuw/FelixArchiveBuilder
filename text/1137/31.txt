22 February 1999 Sport & Diversions 31
FENCING Sport in Brief
The day the ep£e came good
IC 19 - 8 Cambridge
The omens looked
good as the team
that had thoroughly
beaten Cardiff last
week all gathered at
Southside for the
quarter-final match
against the well-fan-
cied Cambridge.
The first weapon up
was sabre and our
fears about the
strength of the
Cambridge team
seemed to sud-
denly b e c o m e
realised as we j
fenced a little badly,
to scrape through 5
- 4 with Thorsten
"Home Boy" and
M o "Mr. Animal" each winning two
fights and Dave "Cap'n Fill" contribut-
ing the last fight win.
Next up was the foil which we
believed to be our strongest weapon,
but as the fights ensued, we were
rather disappointed. The eventual
score was once again 5 - 4 , despite
the fact that we had trashed all the
previous foil teams decisively before.
Despite the fact that Henry the Jock
appeared to be dying of TB, he still
managed to win one fight, Eddie
"Crazy Legs" and Karaoke Dave "APK"
(who seemed to be hungover) each
won two of their three fights to take
victory by the narrowest of margins.
Lastly came epee, traditionally our
weakest w e a p o n , with Cambridge
gloating, as it s e e m e d to be their
strongest weapon. We only had a mar-
ginal lead and had to win four fights
to claim the victory. First up was Rob
"Big Daddy," our German import. After
what was the longest fight of the day.
he won to the great relief of our
watching supporters. Next up was
Nige, the Old Geezer, who after his
recent practice session last week was
back to his top form, winning his fight.
After losing this second epee fight, a
look of worry started to appear on the
faces of the Cambridge team. Our
third epeeist was Crazy Legs who per-
formed a lot better than in his foil
fights to win - we only needed one
more fight to seal the victory. Big
Daddy was up again, and didn't seem
to break sweat as he won his fight to
secure our place in the BUSA finals.
Inspired by this the rest of our epee
team won all their remaining fights.
They had been crushed by our
epeeists with a 9 - 0 victory, the first
in living memory for the IC epee team.
What had earlier seemed a chal-
lenging and close-run contest sud-
denly ran-out as a 19 - 8 victory, which
carries us through to the last four in
the country. Next stop, the Finals.
BOATCLUB
On a very cold Saturday morning, the
Women's Squad travelled North to Peter-
borough, for the first Head Race of the
year. The women's first eight won their
division and were the second fastest
women's eight overall, beaten only by a
Scottish national squad crew. The second
eight also won their division by a large
margin, despite putting the riggers on in
the wrong order. They doubled up to race
in a coxed four, easily winning their divi-
sion and in fact finishing as the fastest
womens four of the day.
The boys, despite forgetting their
riggers and borrowing a boat, were
unlucky to be beaten by a suspicious
Bedford Star crew, but were the seventh
fastest mens crew overall, an extremly
respectable placing for last years novices.
A promising start to 1999.
NIGHT-HIKE
Over the night of 12-13 February, nine
teams of intrepid students set out to
walk a fifteen mile course around the Sus-
sex Downs. The teams, composed of
three or four students, competed for the
fastest time through nine checkpoints.
The event, organised by RCC trea-
surer Mat Collins, was a great success.
Fortunately for the teams, the weather,
although cold, remained reasonably
pleasant all night,-although there were
still traces of snow on the hills. There was
a lot of mud around, but this was the
worst the terrain had to offer. The high-
light of the night for many was the fried
breakfast cooked early on Saturday morn-
ing.
All but one of the teams finished the
course: No. 9, a team of ICU footballers,
were forced to drop out after one mem-
ber, Marie Nicholaou - the Union Deputy
President - injured her leg. The fastest
time was an incredible 4 hours 35 min-
utes, from Three Jerks and a Squirt; canoe
club members Nigel Thacker, Will Blake-
man and Nick Owens.
Of the two CCU teams competing,
CGCU finished sixth overall, with a time
of 6 hours 57 minutes - 68 minutes
faster than the RCS team, who finished
eighth. Other teams represented the
Fellwanderers, Rifle and Pistol, and Ori-
enteering clubs.
ULTIMATE FR1SBEE
IC 21-5PDQ
ICs first match of the south-east ultimate
frisbee league ended in a storming vic-
tory. The score does not fully credit
Portsmouth, and we were lucky to come
away with such a convincing victory.
Aside from the usual godliness of 'Wor-
ship me', 'Who?' and 'Roadrunter', there
was an excellent individual performance
from 'Jesus' (after the addition of some
glue to his hands at half time). This was
an encouraging start to the season, but
definitely some areas to work on.
Better conditions and a full team
should help for the next match against
the south-east indoor championship win-
ners, Southampton Uni, next Wednesday.
CROSS COUNTRY
We realised our team was thoroughly
shagged when no-one turned up at the
union, our team was ravaged by colds, flu
and the previous weekends excesses.
However, ten men managed to com-
plete the course with Bennyboy sand-
wiched by Brunei in 5th and Jodie In
11th The rest of the team trailed in with
only Angus 23rd (pulling off a decent
run). He was followed by Dave in 29th
and Paul in 30th. The rest of the team suf-
fered on the mud with Mike turning his
ankle, Gavin suffering a heart attack and
Giles and Marcos choosing to leave the
spikes at home. The race was awesome
for team spirit, if not for points gained.
The slackers with colds have no excuse.
