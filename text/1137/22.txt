Tiymp
Nymph @ Mass
St. Matthew's Church, SW2. M o n t h l y (sec-
o n d Saturday), £10/£12/£14,10pm-6am,
capacity = 1,000. Dress c o d e - n o n e ,
but m a k e an effort.
Another m o n t h a n d a n o t h e r s t u n n i n g
night at N y m p h . I won't g o o n about this
again 'cos w e d i d a r e v i e w o f it in
D e c e m b e r , but I had to put it in 'cos I
really want to urge y o u all to g o a l o n g
(again a n d again!). It might not have
b e e n as p a c k e d out as o n our last jaunt
to N y m p h , but this didn't really matter -
it was still a top night out. A n d that's a
sign of h o w g o o d the night is - it still
impresses e v e n w h e n it isn't r a m m e d .
Personally it w a s very chilled to g o lo a
night w h e r e y o u c o u l d actually m o v e
a r o u n d w i t h o u t any hassles a n d w h e r e
y o u got the c h a n c e a n d space to strut
your stuff o n the stage w i t h o u t the risk
of getting p u s h e d off by s o m e fat ass!
A n d that is precisely w h e r e I d e c i d e d to
s p e n d most o f the night - o n the stage
in the back r o o m . This w a s the place to
be. The tunes w e r e consistently g o o d .
Top bangin', bouncy, nu-energy laden
beats, with lots of tracks f r o m the Seb
Fontaine/Tony de Vit "Elements" a l b u m ,
and even s o m e old favourites like DJ Mis-
jah's "Access." It's great w h e n the sort o f
music you're into at the m o c o m e s up
again and again at a club - there's noth-
ing better than d a n c i n g to s o n g s y o u
know, n o w is there? Shit, there w e r e
even s o m e a m u s i n g ravers a r o u n d with
fluorescent tops, glowing sticks, a n d bike
lights in the pockets of their c o m b a t
trousers (!) W h y the fuck they w e r e try-
ing to impersonate KIT from KnightRider
is a n y b o d y ' s guess, but at least they
brought a smile to the faces of the m o r e
cynical punters in the club. Thankfully
there w e r e only two of those c h e e s e -
m o n g e r s a r o u n d - the rest of the people
in N y m p h dress pretty well and aren't fro-
mage-led in any way. In fact they are o n e
o f the nicest c r o w d s a r o u n d .
T h e m a i n r o o m w a s a bit m o r e
p a c k e d out, but I've got to say that this
time the music w a s a bit uninspiring
despite of (or perhaps because of, I sup-
p o s e ) t h e p r e s e n c e o f s o m e b i g g i s h
n a m e s in DJ Pierre a n d Marshall Jeffer-
son. O n e friend described it as "light
jazz" by the e n d of the night, but his
brain had b e e n twisted by the hard beats
of the back r o o m , a m o n g s t other things.
Still the crowd s e e m e d to enjoy the main
arena, so it must have b e e n passable.
Next m o n t h (Saturday 13th March)
sees s o m e really big n a m e s d e s c e n d i n g
o n the N y m p h c a m p in the forms of
Justin Robertson (big Club UK DJ a n d
f i o n Rock guy), a n d larley Jackmaster
Funk. After a tiny lull in Feb I reckon that
this o n e will be absolutely heaving.

Space @ The Cross
G o o d s Yard, off King's Way, King's Cross
(opp. Bagley's W a r e h o u s e ) . Currently
monthly party o n Fridays. 1 0 p m - 6 a m ,
capacity - 360. Dress c o d e - to boldly g o
w h e r e no m a n has g o n e before.
Space is the unofficial m e m b e r ' s party at
the Cross, but y o u can also w a n g l e your
way in if y o u are press (tee-hec!) a n d if
y o u arc a really keen punter. It's a col-
l a b o r a t i o n b e t w e e n several nights -
Enigma, Bambi & Bo, and Glitterati, the
last t w o of w h i c h have staged s o m e of
the most legendary nights at Ihc Cross
(and that really is saying something). Try
to get to these w h e n they run 'cos they
are just s o o o o funky, but also try to find
your way into Space, if you've got a bit
of c l u b b i n g time spare.
But, as y o u might imagine with any
trip into Space, this requires lots of prepa-
ration. A "space" dress c o d e really d o e s
m e a n y o u have to m a k e the effort a n d
get s o m e futuristic togs a n d accessories.
O t h e r w i s e y o u probably won't get in
a n d if y o u d o m a n a g e to s o m e h o w ,
then y o u really will feel out o f place.
That's 'cos everyone else will definitely be
looking like Doctor Spock's family a n d
their best mates the Jetsons. A n d as with
everything in life (cliche alert) y o u will
appreciate the effort put in o n c e the
party starts.
The a t m o s p h e r e inside is as friendly
as you'll find a n d n e w friendships are
f o r g e d merely o n the basis of what silly
toys you've brought a l o n g with you. M y
talking C 3 P O p e n certainly c a m e in use-
ful a l t h o u g h getting it to say "Let the
W o o k i e Win" in time with the music was
a bit tricky!
The m u s i c is described by the DJs
a n d promoters as " P u m p i n g Pneumatic
Party" tunes a n d that is exactly what you
get, so I won't bother describing it any
further. A n d as always The Cross itself
was great - still o n e of the most beauti-
ful v e n u e s in the capital.
A l t h o u g h Space has only run for two
nights so far it is u n d o u b t e d l y g o i n g to
m a k e a very b i g impression o n the Lon-
d o n c l u b s c e n e - it's already b e e n voted
(on the internet) as The Cross' best party
( g o o d t h e n or what?). It might easily
b e c o m e o n e o f the nights to be at, just
like Serious@The Cross in 1998.
This night is just about as m u c h fun
as y o u can have clubbing. Try your hard-
est to get tickets - you'll love it. "A g o o d
time y o u will have" as g o o d old Yoda
w o u l d say.
M a y t h e force be with y o u
