Right Angles To Reality
Buses
T
ime and tide waits for n o m a n . Nei-
ther, it seems, d o e s a n u m b e r 14
Routemaster g o i n g d o w n Putney
High Street. If I w a s o f a m o r e suspicious
bent, I'd almost say that t h e driver w a s
ignoring m e o n purpose. As a rule, how-
ever, I don't g o in for conspiracy theories
-1 think that they're just a b i g c o n c o n -
jured up by the establishment, paid for by
big business a n d circulated by the m e d i a
to distract our attention from t h e real
issues. But in the case o f this bus, I'm
prepared to make an
exception. The really
frustrating thing w a s
that I h a d b e e n o h
so tantalisingly close
to that oft-dreamt-of
(but seldom realised)
situation o f strolling
serenely u p to t h e
bus stop just as your
bus pulls up with a
delicate fart o f t h e
airbrakes. It hap-
p e n e d to m e o n c e in N o r w i c h in 1986
and w a s the only bright spot o f a thor-
oughly dismal holiday w h e n , thanks to an
truly gargantuan cock-up w h e n b o o k i n g
the trip, myself a n d three friends spent a
fortnight hitch-hiking a r o u n d w h a t
s e e m e d like every little narrow country
lane in East Anglia. W e w e r e c o n v i n c e d
that w e h a d b o o k e d a sailing holiday
and it w a s only w h e n w e got back to civil-
isation and went to the travel agent to ask
for our m o n e y back that it turned out that
we'd actually signed u p for two w e e k s o n
the Norfolk B-roads. But as I said, at
least I'd m a n a g e d to board a City H o p p e r
in what passes for Norwich t o w n centre,
so that w a s s o m e t h i n g .
O n this particular day, h o w e v e r , I
was not to b e so lucky. I w a s w a l k i n g
briskly d o w n t h e Upper R i c h m o n d Road
towards the crossroads with Putney High
Street and h a d nearly reached t h e traffic
light w h e n t h e a f o r e m e n t i o n e d d o u b l e
decker glided smugly across t h e inter-
section a n d drew up, o v e r s h o o t i n g by
only a couple of d o z e n feet. Suddenly
my quiet little world w a s shattered a n d I
was propelled h e a d l o n g into t h e Silvikrin
Bus Chase Challenge. Let m e explain. Sil-
vikrin, for t h e uninitiated, is t h e n a m e o f
a brand of hairspray popular a m o n g s t
female secretaries a n d librarians in t h e
1970s, t h e television advertising c a m -
paign for w h i c h featured a voice-over
which p o s e d t h e question "is she or isn't
she ?", the point b e i n g to e m p h a s i s e
that the aforementioned hairspray was so
comfortable a n d natural-looking that t h e
only p e r s o n w h o k n e w for certain
whether or not s h e w a s w e a r i n g it w a s
the wearer herself. Whilst the a d in ques-
Matt Salter
'...suddenly my quiet
world was shattered
and I was propelled
headlong into the
Silvikrin Bus Chase
Challenge..."
tion is dead a n d g o n e a n d
Silvikrin is n o w n o longer
considered to b e a front-
line hair care product, the idea at the
heart o f the campaign that sold it lives o n
and n o w finds employment in the nudge-
nudge, wink-wink world of sanitary towel
advertising, a n d the closely related area
of the Silvikrin Bus Chase Challenge. This
latter p h e n o m e n o n rears its ugly head in
just t h e circumstances in which I found
myself at the b e g i n n i n g of this paragraph
- b e i n g almost, but
not quite, o n t i m e
for m y bus.
Whereas in t h e
advert o f the s a m e
n a m e t h e central
d i l e m m a was o n e of
"is s h e or Isn't she",
in the Silvikrin Bus
C h a s e C h a l l e n g e ,
the q u e s t i o n is
"should I or should-
n't I?". Anybody w h o
has lived in L o n d o n for even the shortest
l e n g t h o f t i m e is sure to have b e e n
t h r o u g h this Hamlet-esque experience -
you got through to if y o u
dialled 100 in south-west
Scotland), but in the split-
s e c o n d allowed to m e I w e i g h e d u p all
the relevant factors a n d d e c i d e d to take
up the Challenge. Throwing caution to
the w i n d I set off with the pace (although
not the politics) o f a y o u n g Seb C o e ,
with m y heart in m y m o u t h a n d Vange-
lis ringing in m y ears.
I m a d e it d o w n to the crossroad in a
time w h i c h w o u l d have got m e into t h e
medals for the 200m
in t h e 1924 Paris
O l y m p i c s a n d
r o u n d e d t h e corner
into Putney H i g h
Street, narrowly miss-
ing an octogenarian
piloting a Zimmer-
f r a m e . A q u i c k
s w e e p of the head
right-left revealed
that t h e nearest
o n c o m i n g vehicle
o n the road w a s a Citroen Xantia about
30 yards away a n d travelling at ooh... I
don't know....quickish....might b e o k if
...as I saw the Number
14 flash across the
intersection in front of
me, I felt something a
primeval urge welling
up within me..."
to chase or not to chase? In such situa- I yeah, that's do-able. Without break-
"...I was exiled on my
traffic island, watchinc
my bus receding into
the distance..."
tions p e o p l e w h o in their daily lives have
about as m u c h use for complex vector
mathematics as an England test batsman
has for s u n b l o c k , s u d d e n l y click into
R o b o c o p m o d e . In an instant they have
noted the current positions o f the bus
a n d themselves and have started making
rapid a n d highly detailed assessments
of relative distances, relative speeds, the
state o f traffic c o n -
g e s t i o n further u p
the street, t h e n u m -
ber o f m u m s with
pushchairs/OAPs in
b a t t e r y - p o w e r e d
wheelchairs/buskers
playing " H e r e
C o m e s t h e S u n "
(except for t h e tricky guitar riff in the
middle w h i c h they h u m instead)/ "Big
Issue" vendors or other obstacles o n the
pavement as well as the likelihood of the
next set o f traffic lights but o n e turning
red at an advantageous m o m e n t , in an
effort to decided whether or not to make
a run for the bus.
But n o w , as I s a w the N u m b e r 14
flash across t h e intersection in front o f
m e , I felt a primeval urge w e l l i n g up
within m e (either that or I'd eaten m y
G o l d e n Grahams too quickly) and I k n e w
that m y time had come. Maths has never
b e e n m y strong suit (I flunked the "Intro-
duction to Q u a n t u m M e c h a n i c s " course
unit in m y first degree d u e to m y labour-
ing under the misapprehension that a
Hamiltonian Operator w a s the person
ing stride I half-vaulted, half-slid over t h e
bonnet of a parked ford Capri M k l in a
fashion that w o u l d have h a d Bodic a n d
Doyle n o d d i n g with approval, a n d m a d e
a dash for t h e central reservation. I w a s
half-way there and this real life version of
Frogger w a s almost over. I looked up a n d
noticed to m y horror that t h e trolley-
w i e l d i n g pensioner w h o w a s at that very
m o m e n t struggling
painfully o n to the
platform at the back
o f t h e bus, t o t h e
d e t a c h e d a m u s e -
ment of t h e Blakey-
lookalike conductor,
was t h e last person
in the queue. Panic-
stricken I s n a p p e d m y head round to m y
left, up the hill to s e e if there w a s any-
thing c o m i n g before I m a d e the final
sprint for the tape. Argh! The five red
lights h a d just g o n e out a n d the entire
M o n a c o G P starting grid w a s diving into
Virage St Devote. D a m n , d a m n , d a m n .
Swinging back to m y right, I s a w that
Thora Hird h a d at last boarded t h e bus
and that the conductor h a d his hand o n
the c o m m u n i c a t i o n ' cord. A r r r g g g h h !
Blakey gave a last glance a r o u n d to pick
up any stragglers, g o b b e d copiously onto
the pavement a n d then with a practised
flick of t h e wrist double-dinged t h e bell
to signal to his colleague that it w a s time
to put d o w n T h e Sun with Lovely Lucy
from Leicester a n d get t h e s h o w o n t h e
road. N o o o o o ! As the double-decker
before m e slid smoothly off d o w n the hill
like t h e QE2 at its inaugural launch, the
front r o w o f t h e grid bore d o w n o n m e
in a cloud of 4-star fumes with rows 2 a n d
3 hot o n their heels, a n d I w a s exiled o n
my traffic island, w a t c h i n g m y bus reced-
ing into t h e distance. All that I could d o
n o w was h o p e and pray for a break in the
o n c o m i n g f l o o d o f vehicles..and
...yes...yessss...there it was. Between the
white Golf a n d the blue Hyundai behind
it. M a y b e a c o u p l e o f meters, maybe
more. It w o u l d be
e n o u g h ! A s they
d r e w level with m e , I
broke into a trot a n d
then w h e n the time
w a s right cut sharply
across t h e f l o w of
traffic a n d over to
the o p p o s i t e pave-
m e n t , p r o v o k i n g a
furious bout o f horn-
honking and fist wav-
ing f r o m the
Hyundai driver. I swore at h i m in Korean
a n d belted o f f d o w n the road after my
bus, t h r o w i n g w o m e n a n d children
b e h i n d m e a n d s c r e a m i n g at the top of
my lungs "wait for m e " as I ran. A n d o h
yes, o h yesss! T h e next set o f lights but
o n e w e r e turning r e d ! M y bus w o u l d
have to stop! Thank Y o u G o d ! It was
g o i n g to b e all right, I w a s g o i n g to make
it. Eric Liddlc eat your heart out. I redou-
bled m y efforts a n d sprinted d o w n the
High Street, w e a v i n g f r o m side to side,
sometimes o n the pavement, sometimes
in the gutter, like a Cruise missile seeking
out t h e most efficient route t o d o w n -
t o w n B a g h d a d . A n d all at o n c e , my
quarry w a s before m e , m e r e feet away.
Automatically I thrust out a hand, grabbed
the white pole and h u n g o n tight. As the
bus was travelling slightly faster than I, the
extra forward m o m e n t u m pulled m e off
my feet a n d I landed o n the footplate,
sweating profusely and panting like Darth
Vader c o m i n g ashore at C a p Gris N e z
after a cross-channel s w i m . Using what
little strength I h a d , I d r a g g e d myself
upright with t h e help o f a handrail a n d
collapsed into t h e nearest available seat,
w h e r e u p o n m y fellow passengers broke
spontaneously into a round of applause.
A l t h o u g h w e a k with e x h a u s t i o n I
a c k n o w l e d g e d their congratulations with
a feeble w a v e o f t h e h a n d a n d then
returned to the important task o f gulping
d o w n suitcase-sized lumps of air. M y
exertions s e e m e d to have impressed
even Blakey w h o gave m e a beatific smile
which changed into a vindictive leer as he
turned t o t h e rest o f the passengers a n d
called out "Putney Bridge next stop ! This
bus terminates here! All c h a n g e please!"
