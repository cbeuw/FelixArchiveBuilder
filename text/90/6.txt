This photograph of a line-out was taken
during the Cup f i n a l from the touch l i n e
where s i x t y I.C. supporters gathered t o
encuurage t h e i r team.
The match began with considerable pressure by
U.C., who missed a reasonable chance of a penalty
goal. Play was forced back to the U.C. half and
I. C. were awarded a free kick on the ten-yard l i n e ,
about ten yards i n from touch. Hearn produced one
of his f i n e s t long-range kicks and the b a l l s a i l e d
over the bar. Not long afterwards U.C. were pena-
l i z e d f o r obstruction almost i n front of the posts,
about twenty-five yards out, and Hearn increased
I.C.'s lead to s i x points.
During the f i r s t twenty minutes of the second
h a lf I.C. played magnificently, and several times
came near scoring a t r y . Towards the end of the
game thetl.C. forwards began t o take c o n t r o l and
heavy pressure was maintained on the I.C. l i n e :
however, the defence held out and I.C. had won
the coveted trophy.
F i r s t words of praise must go t o the captain,
Brian Corbett, a rugged and tough front row f o r -
ward, whose enthusiasm has f i r e d the team into many
fine performances during the season. Heroes of the
match i t s e l f , apart from Oggi, were the two centres,
Holman and Ooncaster. Doncaster covered superbly i n
defence : on more than one occasion he was there t o
snatch the b a l l from U.C. w i t h i n a few yards of the
I.C. l i n e and set up a counter-attack which carried
play into the U.C. h a l f . The psychological effect
of such sudden reversals i n fortune on the U.C.for-
wards must have been considerable. Holman, playing
in his eighteenth cup match f o r I.C., was s o l i d and
assured, imbued a f e e l i n g of confidence i n a l l the
backs. He has played i n a l l four winning f i n a l s .
The four freshers i n the side - Stone, Wright, Gibbons
and Dingle-all covered themselves with glory. Cup
nerves were conspicious by t h e i r absence, and a l l the
forwards f*ught themselves t o a stand-
s t i l l , ,
I.C. has established i t s e l f as
e a s i l y the leading rugger college i n
U.L. Not only does i t run s i x teams,,
a l l with strong and a t t r a c t i v e f i x t u r e -
l i s t s , but i t s Cup record i s outstand-
ing. In the l a s t seven years the
heaviest Cup defeat has been 0-3 by
the Vets, i n 1950s
. During t h i s per-
iod 21 cup matches have been played
of which 16 have been won, 2 drawn and
3 l o s t . i;C. have scored 203 points
to t h e i r opponents 44. This year
63 points have been amassed without
reply, s l i g h t l y better than the 62-6
in 1952-53.
By the time I.C. reached the Hostel a f t e r t n e i r
exertions on the f i e l d and celebrations i n sundry
bars they r e t i r e d exhausted t o bed, and Frank should
have had a good night's sleep.
