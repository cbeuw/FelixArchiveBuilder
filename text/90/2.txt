last Thursday evening the I.C, Musical Society gave their
Easter Conoert in the Concert Hall of .Queen Alexandra's House.
The choir was accompanied by the Jacques String Orchestra
(lender: Emanuel Hurwitz) with Christopher Shaw at the piano.
Miss Imogen Hoist, who trains the choir, was the conductor.
The professional soloists were Sosamund Strode and Shirley
Walker, Soprano: Kay Poster, Contralto: Philip Todd, Tenor
and Donald Frankie (who took the place of Walter Todds at 24
hours notioe) Bass.
After a performance, by the orchestra, of Baah's Third
3randeriburg Concerto, the choir sang, unaccompanied, a Madrigal:
'All Creatures now are Merry Minded' by John 3ennet. Then
followed 'Ode on a Grecian Urn' by the conductor's father. The
singing during this first half laoked spirit and, until they
warnwd up, the sopranos were » l i t t l e weak*
Not so the second half, whioh was a great ImpSoromaot.
A shortened version of Puroall's 'King Arthur' was swig with
life and i t was-apparent ths* the choir, as well as She audienofj
enjoyed the seoond far more than the first half. In fact, so

Of the soloists Kay Poster was exoellent and Shirley Walker was
very olear on her top notes. At the end of the nonoert Janet
Walsby (president I.C. Mus. Soc.) presented Miss Hoist with a
large bouquet.
VICTORIANA
ilie spirit of the 'Music Hall', the wioked villian of
the melodrama, the Victorian ballad, are all things of a
byegone age, all stock characters "which to us reflect that
age. To revive them, to make them live again, however
requires above a l l , an infinite amount of 'gusto'.
Judging by results, the gusto whioh members of the
Dramatic Society and Musical Society gave to 'Victoriana'
on Monday 19th march in Ayrton Hall must have been infinite.
The audience was treated to a grand mixture of, melo-
drama, complete with hisses and boos, Victorian music, a
mime with a narration in vorse which can only be described
as ghastly, quartets from Gilbert and Sullivan, and sundry
other items in the form of songs and monologues. A l l of
these were strung together by a chairman in''true Victorian
style.
The longest single item on the b i l l was a one act
play "Hiss the Villain", which was produced by Derek Hill
who did very well earlier in the evening in a short
sketch. To single out other individuals from this very :
pleasant evening would only be unfair to the others, but
Judy Kornbluth is to be congratulated for her work as
organiser in ohief.
No eonfidflnce in ( t a r s u s Policy
The U.L.TJ. Photographic Exhibition was on view in the Union
in Malet St. during the last week. There were 531 entries from
18 Colleges! and Hospitals. It is a great pity that there was
not a room large enough to house them all,,consequently anyone
wishing to view them all had to wander all over the "Building,
sometimes without the aid of the 14ft, yet s t i l l miss some in
an obscure corner.
The I.C. photographers, going
straight from their own exhibition
took one first and three third prizes
in the four sections. They also ent
ered seven photographs whioh were
among the twenty-eight highly ocm-
mended. These results were roughly in
proportion to the number of I.C,
entries as they contributed about one
third of the total.
It i s interesting to note that
In some cases the winners
in the I. C. competition staw placed lower than prints which
they had beaten there. This shorn how the opinion of the judges
varies and points to ths fact that their judgement must he based
en their likes and dislikes to a certain extent, and not pwreSjr
on photographic —
THE UNION DEBATE.
The motian of the Union Debate held on
13th. March was: "This house has no Confidence i n
the Government's handling o f Foreign and C o l o n i a l
A f f a i r s . "
Jua_ i n t e r e s t i n g debate was opened by Aidan
Crawley, speaking f o r the motion. I t was followed-
by the speaker f o r the opposition, The Hon.
Patrick Maitland M.P., whose a b i l i t y as a speaker
was shown i n the masterly manner i n which he hand-
led the l i v e l y audience. The two I.C. speakers
followed, .with John Bingham f o r the motion and
Terry Smith against.". Their speeches were of a
high standard, l i k e the subsequent ones delivered
from the f l o o r . In fact the outside debaters were
impressed with the standard of I.C. debates.
The popularity of the motion was shown by the
voting at the end with 85 votes f o r the notion,
34 against with 13 abstentions. These f i g u r e s do
not r e f l e c t the number of the audience as many
l e f t before 3 p.m. Mr. Les A l l e n (The President
of I.C. L i t . and Deb. Soc.) i s t o be congratulated
on the high q u a l i t y of debates held t h i s year.
Railway Society Excursion
The Railway Society.
The Railway Society recently v i s i t e d the Long- .
moor M i l i t a r y Railway at Liss, Hants., In a t r a i n
furnished with carpets and armchairs, they made a
conducted tour of the l i n e , with various interuptions
to erect step signs across the roads - there was
even a corporal with a red f l a g .
At Longmoor downs the i t i n e r y included the
Garrison Church, the Naafi for lunch, and the auauetv

absence of smoke and p o l i s h , and the signal school,

on to the s i g n a l box, and then back to the t r a i n .
There were anxious moments as i t reversed over the
half completed track (not a monorail), but Liss was
duly returned to, with several members r i d i n g the

. General impressions of the v i s i t were that
Longmoor i s a train-wreckers paradise - many filmed
t r a i n crashes that have occurred there, although
the Society did not a c t u a l l y witness one.
Other a c t i v i t i e s of the Society t h i s year have
included works v i s i t s and t a l k s , ranging from d i s -
cussions on Tube brakes t o r e v i s i o n of the best i n
swim wear advertisements. For the future, a long
distance v i s i t to the Manchester-Sheffield e l e c t r i -
f i e d main l i n e has been arranged, and w i l l include
a brake-van t r i p , and the annual Dinner w i l l doubt-

. Touchstone Weekend.
Education was*the subject of the l a s t Touch-
stone Weekend, which was held on the 1 0 - l l t h March.
The guest speaker, Mr. Sylvester, the Chief Educat-
ional O f f i c e r f o r B r i s t o l , discussed the s o c i a l
implications of our present educational system,
p a r t i c u l a r l y the effect o f now trends. Examples
quoted included decentralisation, modern compre-
hensive schools, and group methods of teaching
involving discussion and research.
Two informal discussion groups then considered
«a» p h i l o s o p h i c a l aspect of the 'subject. An attempt
waa made t o define the meaning and aims o f education.
Is was regretted that modern education tends t o
concentrate upon the a c q u i s i t i o n of s p e c i f i c know-
ledge with the consequent neglect of the wider
aspects of l i f e .
