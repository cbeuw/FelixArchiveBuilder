Dear sir.
During a discussion on student honesty a well known Guilds,
man onoe said 'Let's face i t - a l l students are crooks'. I aiB-
not suggesting that this is entirely true - 'some' should replace
' a l l ' . There are sufficient petty thieves and thoroughly object-
ionable characters among us to leave a nasty taste in the aotSkh.
Anyone going into Guilds will see notices exhorting people,
to look up there belongings because of the likelyhood of
having them stolen.
Quite frequently most of the daily newspapers have vanished
from the Union byeveniag , some of the piotorial weeklies or
part of them soon get stolen. The Union Library has had
hundreds of books stolen. The gatecrashing , of dances and carn-
ivals is another page in the sorry tale or some of our fellow
students, than the Swimming Club held a hop in Ayrton Ball a
barricade was built to stop people gaining access from the bar.
This was so constructed that i t could n ot be brokeii down from
the outside, nevertheless later in the evening i t was demolished.
Some one With a ticket had let his cronies in - nice fallows.-
Carnivals give some students an excellent opportunity to
show their hooliganism. The measures employed to try to. keep
gatecrashers out have now been forced to the estrone of
hiring uniformed doormen. Thefto from the bars prooeod apaoe-
Bottles of whisky and brandy at the last one. Good ChapsJ
It Would appear to be about time a definite attempt ware
•ado to patch these swine and throw them out of the Union.
Tours sincerely,

Dear Sir,
With reference to the oomments on the N.U.S. motion
at the reoent I.C. Union Meeting, which you published in
your last edition. I would like to point out that I have
never been a member of the Communist Party.

Dear Sir,
I feel that, as thettirae for our return to ths Union
building draws nearer, one or two observations on eating habits
would not be out of place.
I admit that i t is necessary to hurry through one's lunoh,
so as not to inconvenience others. This, however, i s no excuse
for the animal habits of some diners. As we are at University,
i t follows, I hope, that we are a l l sensible, responsible
persons. Nowhere is the lack of manners more apparent than.at
table. Therefore I suggest that a l l members of the Union make
a conscious effort to avoid the mare obvious breaches of eat-
ing etiquette.
Nothing looks worse than a queue of soruffs, some of
whom are s t i l l wearing grimy raincoats or scruffy soarves.
Nothing looks worse than tables oluttered up with dirty
crockery, left by some forgetful diner, and those rings,
those disgusting rings.
I know that present conditions are not oondueive to
good Manners, but I appeal to a l l mmbers of the Union to make
the effort and make sating hare much pleasanter.
Temps eto.,
Tony Iaoreenx.
