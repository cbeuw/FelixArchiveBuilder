FELIX 1954 SCOOP
News of the Imperial College. Expansion
was disclosed to the National Press l a s t Thurs-
day p r i o r to the Rector'* lecture on the subject.
FELIX d i d not attend the press conference, despite
i t s having the largest c i r c u l a t i o n on the"Island
O P M E N T / Site"( suppressed i n the
* i I • recent E^S.E. survey),
since i t had anticipated
the architect's intentions
i n a b r i l l i a n t journal-
i s t i c scoop i n 1954.
Roger Sykes' sketch, r e -
produced again, shows
that even the number of
stories i n what i s to be
a central home f o r stud-
ents i n the middle of the
s i t e was accurately fore-
t o l d . The Sykes building
was placed on the s i t e of
the Beit Building. In
those days of optimism
i t had not been r e a l -
ized that at the current
rate of b u i l d i n g by
Marples Ridgway and Part-
ners that i t would take
f i f t e e n years t o erect the
Sykes building.
The i n t e r e s t i n g
features of the Dawbarn
plans are the galvano-
meter shaped auditorium
facing the Royal College
of Science, and the sky-
scraper behind i t . The
architect pointed.out on
Thursday that Br b u i l d i n g
of this height had to be
i n the centre of the sight
to preserve the 'ancient
l i g h t priveleges of the
Albert and Queens Gate
Mansions.

Neptune Gets Plastered
R.C.S.CARNIVAL
On Friday evening (16th. March) havoc was
again l e t loose at I.C.; the R.C.S. held t h e i r
Carnival, "Night time with Neptune". Students
intent on dancing and Asbauchery were introduced
to l i f e i n an underwater cavern, who where, the
attractions were Mr. Vere Atkinson's mermaids,
( t h e i r Green t a i l s brought back memories of The
Green Lady, and we paused to r e f l e c t on who
modelled f o r Mr. Atkinson's creations, no con-
clusion, however, was reached.) The f l a t s were
of a standard which we have come to expect from
the R.C.S.. A rough estimate of the time that
went into t h e i r preparation i s 500 man/women
hours. Had the u n s k i l l e d labour been p a i * 3/6
par hour.the cost would have been £87..10..0.
Music from the I.C. jazz band, the Clubmen
and others was enjoyable, and a d u l l cabaret
livened up at the end with a custard pie act
in which even the audience participated, law
primary feature of carnivals i s the fancy dress.
I t was noticeable that there was a d i s t i n c t lack
of Inspiration and o r i g i n a l i t y i n the dress of the
majority present.
RECTOR'S ADVICE
IMPLEMENTED
I.C. 1st. XV comp-
leted a great season by
winning the University
Cup F i n a l l a s t Satur-
day. This was I.C.'s
fourth winning f i n a l i n
f i v e years.
The fact that a
horse c a l l e d "Brian
Oge" won the f i r s t r a c ^
at L i n g f i e l d on F r i -
day was considered a
happy augury f o r the
occasion. Sure enough
Brian "Oggi" Hearn was
in f i n e form and two
penalty goals kicked
by him won the match.
Before the match
a message was conveyed
from the Rector, who
was unable to attend
owing to an attack of
l a r y n g i t i s . I t t o l d
the team,in no un-
c e r t a i n terras, what t o
do to U.C. A delighted
Dr. Sparkes, the club
President, was able t o
bellow over the phone
to Mrs Linstead that
the instructions had
been duly carried out.
An account of the match appears on the page 6.
General Studies Discordance
The questionnaire forms sent out with
FELIX two editions ago recieved the l i m i t e d
support anticipated. Of 352 forms returned,
these were c l a s s i f i e d as 220 occasiohal a t -
tenders at the lectures, 18 regular, and the
remainder never.
The Mech. Eng. and Elec. Eng. departments
encouraged students to attend, while the
Chemistry and Chem.Eng.tended to be h o s t i l e .
Upon verbal enquiry i t was found that the
students attitude frequently reflected that
of his tutor.
The t i t l e of the lecture invariable drew
the audience, though a well-known name had
equal a t t r a c t i o n .
The present time was suitable f o r 95 per
cent of the attenders, though X hour e a r l i e r
was suggested to prevent overrunning, and to
allow more time f o r questions.
117 people pointed out that the meetings
of the Union andvarious committees clashed
with general studies, and the religous societies
and R i f l e eiub claimed supporters
Suggestions f o r topics gave the humourists
greatest opportunity, but i n general i t seemed
that the present range was s a t i s f a c t o r y , i t
appealing to many tastes, A request f o r more
controversial t o p i c s was prominent, whether
religous, p o l i t i c a l or moral. The i n d i v i d u a l
topics of l o c a l histdry, modern architecture,
t r a v e l , and the bizarre were reqested. It was
surprising that so many students s t i l l wanted
lectures on sex.
