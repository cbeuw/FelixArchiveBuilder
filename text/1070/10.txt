FELIX FRIDAY 22ND NOVEMBER C O L U M N S 11
Time for a change this week, I think.
You must be a shade fatigued by the
relentless 'analysis' of Sherfield's
activities, entirely justified as it is, of
course. As for Ian Caldwell, even I
am almost tinged with guilt, particu-
larly since he is finally starting to act
with financial prudence over the sale
of Boathouse rubble to the alumni.
Magnificent idea. If it worked for
some hideous lump of concrete in
Germany, think what we can get for
lovely Putney bricks. I shall also
resist the urge to mention a recent
incident in the Student fees office,
where a friend of mine was kept
waiting for over five minutes, despite
the presence of six staff when he
entered the room, finally to be served
by some chap whose essential work
on a computer consisted of playing
Chess. Perhaps Mike Hansen would
care to take up the running on this
one.
No, this week it's Europe.
Die-hard followers of this column
will know that I am not the most
ardent fan of the European Union. I
have long held the belief that the
Single Market, which allies more
closely with Britain's long standing
adherence to free trade than with
many of our continental partners, is
very important. My problem is with
the inexorable
drive to harmon- ^ | JJ*| 0
isation, integra-
tion and federal-
ism. As the days
go by, I can find
more and more
reasons why
monetary union
is fatally flawed.
Aside from the
pathetic point
about tourists
avoiding curren-
cy commission,
not one water-
tight argument
for it appears to
have been put. VOICQ OI
The notion that
economies as disparate as Germany
and Portugal can be 'aligned' and
'converge', to be run under a single
economic policy and interest rates is
plainly absurd, a point which the
peoples of Europe, particularly
Germany are beginning to see. How
on earth can the Deutschmark retain
all its value after 1999 if it becomes
the Euro merged with currencies it
has historically
J D G K C F been stronger
than?
Britain, quite
rightly, is not tak-
ing all this at face
value. We are
quite prepared to
pick and choose
policies that are
beneficial to
Britain, since we
clearly don't share
the Franco-
German 'dream'
of a united
Europe. The
recent working
week fiasco is a
perfect example. We secure an opt
out from the Social Chapter, which
contains the legislation, and so the
European Commission decide to call
it Health and Safety, which we can't
Reason
veto. This shows that the system is
not working. Individual concerns are
being swept away in the name of the
greater good. Subsequently the only
way that our voice can be heard is by
scuppering major summits, which
does little for the dignity of the EU.
However, desperate situations call
for desperate remedies. So much of
recent EU policy is blatantly against
Britain's best interests- fishing, agri-
culture, employment, transport and
so on. It is time to renegotiate our
position in the club, otherwise we
will arrive at a situation where public
opinion will jeopardise the benefits
by calling for our exit, which is not
as crazy as it sounds.
Finally, can I remind the Hockey
Thirds that 'funny names' in your
reports were funny and original at
roughly the sametimethat Little and
Large were. The sports team, devious
swines that they are, only leave them
in to make you look silly, so don't
do it. 'Indian Carpet catalogue'
indeed. But what happened to 'Swiss
Cottage'?
i n t h e c o u r s e of d u t y -
At this point I must take a brief break
from my academic extemporising to
alert everyone that a great, perverse
and repugnant injustice may soon be
brought upon us all. For those of
you who have not kept up with cur-
rent affairs, certain people are
attempting to ban the release of the
film 'Crash'. Crash was made by
David Cronenbourg, possibly the
most vital, creative film maker alive
today. It was based on the book by
J. G. Ballard, the most profound,
prophetic writer of the late twentieth
century. The book tells the tale of
certain normal individuals, and the
manner in which their lives were
irrevocably changed by their
involvement in serious car crashes.
Although I have not seen it (and pos-
sibly never will) there is no doubt in
my mind that this film is one of the
most beautiful, powerful and dis-
turbing ever made. And yet,
philistines such as Virginia
Bottomley are attempting to prevent
the public seeing it. Their claim: that
it is sick, pornographic and brutal.
They are correct of course, it is
sick, it is depraved, it is undeniably
brutal and possibly pornographic,
but that is no reason for not showing
it - it is also a great, important work
of art. Films such as Die Hard and
Eraser are far more brutal and vio-
lent than this, and far lesser works of
art, and they are shown and lauded at
every turn. The crowds love them,
they cheer at every decapitation and
mutilation. So, what is the problem
with Crash? It is different because it
is not enjoyable, it is not pleasant, it
is wholly foul. This is because it
exposes parts of the human psyche
which the politicians prefer to brush
under the carpet. They do not want
to admit that humans might be by
their very nature cruel, sexual
beings, excited by violent, senseless
death. They prefer to imagine that
people can, and will, fit into the
shroud of artificial normality that
they have cast.
It is in a similar manner that cer-
tain psychological experiments
(Milgram's obedience experiment
and Zimbardo's prison simulation; I
will not go into details here but they
are described in any standard psy-
chology textbook should you wish to
look them up) have been branded
unethical. The ostensible reasons for
this are weak and largely irrelevant;
the real reason for this branding was
simply because they revealed the
true brutality of the human mind.
So I say that Crash must be
shown. In fact it should be shown
everywhere; in cinemas, on televi-
sion, in supermarkets, on giant pub-
lic screens on street corners. It
should be compulsory viewing at
schools, it should be an essential part
of every curriculum. Not just
because it is an incredible work ofj
art, but because it could prove to be
the most revealing film ever made.

NIGHT TO DAY
Sinking into this murky depression,
no control of one's powers
and powers seem to be lost
Bliss and happiness arriving abruptly
then going away quietly
in a simmering twilight
Covers the ears
making a sign of understanding...
cars passing by seeking the buzz...
It's night again.
All the zeros join together
to make for a new start,
that won't begin,
Nil
You haven't got a stomach for this.
It's all acting in a world that you dream upon.
Just one slight breath changes it
From night to day
Dawn.
Impatience and ruin
Waking up, dancing, weaving their old pattern.
Leaving information on where
to begin again:
Just a thought
