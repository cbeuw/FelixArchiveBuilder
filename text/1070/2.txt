assessments in the 'old' universities,
which are seen as an "unwieldy" way
of repeating other reports to deter-
mine "whether the provision of edu-
cation is satisfactory or not". Union
members will stop completing the
necessary documentation for these
assessments.
MATTHEW K E M P T O N
Last Friday the editors of Orbital,
Royal Holloway's student newspa-
per, burned copies in an incinerator
and waved placards outside their
union building. They were demon-
strating against what they saw as the
union censoring the paper to cover
up corruption in the student union
last year.
One of the main allegations relat-
ed to voteriggingin last years sab-
batical elections. Most of the cen-
sored article was based on inside
information from a third year stu-
dent, Matthew Bricknell. He was
education welfare assistant last year
but resigned over the summer. He
was then sacked from his job at the
union bar and banned from the union
altogether. The double page article
was just going to print when Mr
Bricknell retracted his statement,
which consisted of letters and
recorded interviews on tape.
Although he had signed legal docu-
There are also threats of action
against "examinations and assess-
ment, or a slow down on student
admissions". This action was voted
for along with the strike vote, and
was accepted with a far greater
majority than the strike itself, so
could have a huge impact.
ments affirming his statement, solic-
itors acting on behalf of the Union
and Mr Bricknell threatened to sue if
the article went ahead. Siva
Ganeshanandan the union's general
secretary ordered the article to be
ripped out of every paper. Last year
the Orbital reported on elections for
the position of general secretary,
which Siva Ganeshanandan won.
One candidate was banned from the
union because the welfare officer
said he was a racist and homophobe,
the ban was later overturned. In the
same elections the ballot box was
found to contain 40 more votes than
were registered.
A statement from Orbital said
"We believe that the article we are
being forced to withdraw is not only
true, but just begins to uncover the
extent of the irregularities and dis-
crepancies which took place in the
union in the last academic year". The
statement went on to call for a full
investigation.
200 GIRLS : 1 BLOKE
Last Thursday, there was widespread
disturbance at Wimbledon railway
station, south-west London. A riot-
ing, screaming, brawling crowd,
entirely made up of roughly 200
schoolgirls caused chaos with a large
scale fight.
Shopkeepers were forced to lock
up and traffic was brought to a stand-
still as the scrap spilled onto the road.
Passers-by were dragged into the
fray completely at random. It was
only with the arrival of Police offi-
cers waving truncheons that some
semblance of order could be
restored.
The fight had started when two
girls, one from Ricards Lodge High
School, the other from Ursuline
High, had started to argue about one
of the boys from Wimbledon
College. It didn't take long for all
their friends to join in, turning a per-
sonal argument into a screaming,
kicking brawl.
"This lad at our school is going out
with a girl from Ursuline, but anoth-
er girl at Ricard Lodge fancies him.
That's what thefightwas all about,"
explained a pupil from Wimbledon
College. Although there is a lot of
bad feeling between these two
schools, people were amazed that
more than 200 girls wouldfightover
one bloke.
A police officer remarked "You
just don't expect this sort of thing
between girls. This was a bloody
riot."
E A S T M E E T S WEST
A slightly late start did not detract
from the "East Meets West" show
last Tuesday. It turned out to be a
thoroughly enjoyable and well-
organised event exuding colour,
humour and energy.
As part of the Diwali celebra-
tions set up by the Indian Society, it
was decided that, in the light of the
forthcoming merger between
Imperial College and Charing Cross
and Westminster Medical School,
the show would be staged in The
Great Hall in Sherfield, and not at
Charing Cross as it normally was.
The show was a sell-out, with
over 700 people buying tickets. It
was planned with charity in mind,
with all the evening's proceeds going
to the Leukaemia Research Fund and
the Jaipur Limb appeal.
Two students, one a medic and
the other from IC, did a good job as
the comperes, who despite keeping
up a derisory repartee, emphasised
that they were breaking new ground
and "leading the way into the future."
The programme was varied, with
traditional dances, fashion parades,
singers and comedy sketches. The
highlight of the night depended on
what sex you were, with a selection
of "professional models" for the boys
and at least two toned torsos for the
girls. The audience were keen to par-
ticipate and the male compere was
asked at one point to "Come up here,
sexy" by one particularly forthright
lady.
The only dubious parts were the
chronic hairdos, some very glum
models, and the infinite thank-yous
and goodbyes at the end.
The drummers rounded off the
night with a rousing performance
which got the audience in the mood
for the after-show party, which fin-
ished at 1.30pm. Dinesh Dhoona,
one of the choreographers, described
the show as "the best ever. It was a
dream come true."
Videotapes of the complete per-
formance will soon be available from
the Student Television of Imperial
College.
ULU COUNCIL
The second University of London
Union Council of the year meeting
saw a raft of motions presented for
discussion by the ULU executive. On
the table were a motion proposing a
campaign against fees, one requiring
the sabbaticals' support of ULU's
International Night and a motion to
pass the new ULU regulations.
Two contentious motions original-
ly on the agenda were withdrawn at
the last minute following early
amendments and a change of mind
by the motion's proposer. These
were a paper on Student
Maintenance proposed by ULU
Welfare sabb Paul Bates, and a
motion to ban clubs that used guns
proposed by ULU LGB officer and
IC student Jo Paice.
After much debate, all motions
tabled were passed more or less with-
out alteration. However, the motion
on the campaign against fees had
some specific points removed from
the paper pertaining to the cause and
effect of the implementation of top-
up fees, whilst the motion on
International Night was passed
unscathed.
The Council saw the first public
outing for newly elected part-time
sabb Nick Dearden, who replaced
Claire Lawrie as Vice-Predident for
Finance and Services.
