Wales, swimming, and the meaning of 3Â°C
MATTHEW G O O D B O D Y
On a traditional canoe club freshers
trip there is a chance for the new
members to attempt some simple
white-water paddling. However, due
to the lack of water in the preferred
rivers, and the use of the new, seem-
ingly indestructable, two seater
teaching kayak our plans were
altered.
After arriving early on Saturday
morning we woke up early (honestly,
we did) and set off for the Aber
Glaslyn. After scraping and knuck-
ling down the top section, being fear-
less/stupid, we decided to attempt the
gorge taking a beginner down in the
two seater. A probe team was sent
down first with all the usual probe
beater problems. After they had
shown us quite impressively where
not to get stuck or pinned, and where
to avoid three-boat pile-ups, we set
off.
The two seater charged down the
river (well, bounced might be more
accurate) and they managed to only
come out and swim once, putting a
big dent in the back which had
mended itself by the next morning.
Even the breaker (many pointed
rocks) was negotiated superbly by a
brave and trusting beginner and
Garth (acting like a fish for the third
time this week).
Unfortunately the rest of us were
not quite as impressive, going down
backwards and swimming (OK, so it
was me who went swimming).
After all the excitement, it was
back to the hut for chilli (of course)
and lots of beer, thanks to Ross and
the chocolate eating kip kid Drew,
who procured us this banquet.
So to Sunday, and the middle section
of the Conwy. Now back on a fairly
sensible river, the beginners were
taught the essential basics of pad-
dling on a flowing river. They coped
amazingly on a tough stretch of
water, with an astoundingly low
number of swims.
If the innane grins on everyone's
faces afterwards is any indication,
then fun was had by all, and we are
all looking forward to our next trip.
Anyone interested in canoing can
meet the canoe club at 7.15 on a
Tuesday evening in Beit for a pool
session. Our next river trip is to the
River Dart next weekend. All stan-
dards are welcome.
Strong performances all round for IC rugby

The first-half of the game proved
difficult. After conceeding thirty
points to UCL, the IC Thirds recol-
lected their thoughts during the
interval, and so dominated the sec-
ond-half that UCL were unable to
improve on their score.
With an agressive return, IC
showed their prowess as a well dis-
ciplined squad. Relentless tackling
and recycling from the forwards
unleashed the pace and swift han-
dling of the backs. Little more than
ten minutes into the match the the
back-row co-ordinated with the cen-
tres to put Toby Hoakin in for a con-
verted try. A second try was sealed
in the corner from another backrow
manoevre minutes later.
With the spirit and pressure gener-
ated during the second-half, it was
only a shame more points didn't
come. In the end, the scoreline didn't
reflect the effort that IC put in, with
UCL taking the match by thirty
points to twelve.

Needing a victory to ensure progress
into the play-offs in the BUSA
national championships, IC Seconds
produced a top notch performance,
and demolished LSE to the tune of a
massive (and almost unbelievable)
margin of fifty (that's right, fifty)
points to nil.
From the opening kickoff, IC
made their intentions clear, with a
seven phase sequence moving IC to
the LSE tryline. Capitalising on the
opportunity offered by a strike
against the head, Darren Bryce bull-
dozed in to open the floodgates.
Continuity was a major theme of the
match, with the IC pack able to con-
tinuously recycle the ball and make
further inroads into a beleagured
LSE defence.
Tries flowed thick and fast, with
Michael Peachment, Dave Chatagy
and Barry Richards making one each
before half-time. The game was
sewn up by the interval with IC
stretching the lead out of the Econ-
omists reach, rampaging to 31-0.
In the second-half IC kept up the
pressure, and further tries followed
for Kolone Yung (his fourth of the
year), James Sopper and Michael
Peachmont (with his second of the
day). Fullback Justin Lee supplied
five conversions, adding a further ten
points to the rapidly swelling IC
scoreline.
To be truthful, LSE never stood a
chance, as IC systematically took
them to the cleaners, as the scoreline
so clearly demonstrates.
Skipper Julian Harrison was
extremely satisfied with the team
performance - though next weeks
opponents will hopefully provide
stiffer opposition.
The whole team then retired to
Khan's for a well deserved victory
meal, happy in the knowledge that
glory is within their grasp.

The driving rain did nothing to
dampen IC's spirits in their first
game of the season, against Barts.
We hit them hard in the first ten
minutes, with Sarah Waiman scor-
ing a stormingfirsttry. The opposi-
tion began to fight back, but excel-
lent defence work kept Barts at bay
for the rest of the first-half.
After the break, IC began to fight
back, with Petra delivering a second
try to boost the winning margin to a
convincing ten points, with the final
score IC 10, Barts 0.
Everyone played well, especially
the new girls. In particular, some
superb flying tackles from Clare,
and a formidable front row led by
Mo, were key in this victory. The
players of the match were Mo
Bradley for the forwards, and Petra
Vacas for the backs.
The team performance showed
huge promise for the remainder of
the season.
