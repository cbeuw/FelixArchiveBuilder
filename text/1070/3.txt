FELIX FRIDAY 22ND NOVEMBER NEWS 3
Safety checks on site installed, but doubts remain
MATHIEU RICHARD
Following the numerous recent inci-
dents on the IC construction sites
(Felix 1064), which have entered the
College folklore, an independent
audit commissioned to investigate
has finally reported back.
Several new measures have now
been implemented in order to guaran-
tee the safety of the staff and students
in response to the safety survey. The
Director of Estates, Ian Caldwell,
described this issue as "of paramount
importance".
Following the last incident, Schal,
the main contractor, has decided to
establish a permanent Quality
Manager on site, as well as a Safety
Manager, whose responsibilities
include a one-month review of the
project. This emphasises the fact that
all incidents have been proved to be
due to "lapses in quality" and human
error - for example, the cause for the
Mars hopes
crash and burn
Sunday, 17th November, saw the
launch of the Mars-96 probe by
Russia. It was the culmination of
seven years work and £38.5 million
pounds of funding. Despite high
hopes and a successful launch the
craft made an unexpected return to
Earth after the fourth series of boost-
er rockets failed to fire.
The spacecraft carried a multitude
of instruments designed to explore
mars and find out more about the
Red planet. It had sensors to mea-
sure seismic activity, magnetic
fields, atmospheric pressure and
many other variables, in order to
help scientists determine whether or
not microscopic life did once live on
Mars.
Australian Prime Minister, Paul
Keating, ordered emergency teams
to be readied following a warning
from the White House that the probe
could crash land there. Luckily the
probe crashed into the Pacific ocean.
There are, however, fears of a radia-
tion leak as the probe was carrying
several canisters of high-grade plu-
tonium, which powered the probe's
generators. Russian scientists have
claimed that they would have sur-
vived the crash intact.
Imperial College's Professor
David Southwood, from the Space
and Atmospheric Physics Group,
developed specialist equipment for
the craft.
ceiling collapse in the library walk-
way at the beginning of term was the
choice of too thin a wire for ceiling
ties.
These new members of the Schal
team are supposed to minimise the
risks of something similar happening
again by supervising the work of the
different sub-contractors and enhanc-
ing the co-ordination of the teams.
Schal has also started advanced train-
ing sessions to improve the sub-con-
tractors' concern for safety, and to
prepare the workmen more adequate-
ly for the specific problems raised by
a construction project in an occupied
environment like the College.
More recently, the report commis-
sioned by Mr Caldwell from
Waterman Safety Ltd about the safe-
ty of the installations on site has
revealed a few faults in the overall
disposition of basic requirements
such as fire extinguishers, service
ladders etc., but has also suggested a
couple of measures for the enhance-
ment of the safety controls.
The weekly "disruption meetings,"
between the Imperial College Safety
authorities and representatives of the
construction firms, will now be
chaired by the College Project
Manager, Ian Frame, in order to plan
the disruptions and possible hazards
ahead more than was the case before.
The purpose of these meetings,
which have been held since the
beginning of the realisation of the
project is to avoid as much as possi-
ble any nuisances to the staff and stu-
dents of the College.
Moreover, the College Safety
Representative Ian Gillet now
inspects the site weekly, also concen-
trating on the way the contractors'
work affects the College more than
on the effective technical quality of
the precise work done. Thus, accord-
ing to Mr Gillet, both potential caus-
es of incidents will be better mas-
tered - the quality of the work in
itself, and its direct implications on
the everyday life of the College.
To the question of whether further
accidents are still possible, Mr
Caldwell confidently replied with an
assured tone "We believe that what is
in place should prevent other prob-
lems."
Nevertheless, the particular condi-
tions in which the building work has
to be done - on a functioning and
crowded campus - are certainly still a
potential source of incidents.
Students are still wary of the works
following the reports of safety
breaches and dangerous construc-
tions reported in previous Felixes. "I
still check the roof just outside the
library before I go in" commented
one regular user of the facility. "I
hope it is all worth it in the end."
