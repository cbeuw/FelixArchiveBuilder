R S M FOOTBALL FIRSTS STORM
THROUGH IN CUP
After receiving a bye in the first
round, RSM Firsts started their cup
venture in the second round against
Charring Cross Firsts. It was going to
be a good benchmark for us since the
opposition plays in a league higher
than ours.
The game started off with RSM
having the better play. Ten minutes
into thefirsthalf Johan was through
on goal, only to be blatantly fouled.
A clear professional foul, therefore
deserving a red card. But the referee
let the guilty player off. We did how-
ever get a free-kick in a dangerous
position. Michael turned the ball
around the wall, leaving the goalie
no chance. We then forced a two-nil
lead, following a magnificent indi-
vidual effort from Si. After winning
the ball, he easily passed three
defenders and then chipped the
goalie. Without question, this was
the goal of the season.
However, RSM then - whether out
of compassion or merely lack of con-
centration - handed the opposition
the initiative. Charring Cross did cre-
ate some half-chances, but could not
capitalise on their achievements until
twenty minutes from time. Although
Larson managed a touch, the ball
could not be prevented from going
in, to reward Charring Cross for their
efforts.
Keith, in keeping with a long tra-
dition of RSM attacking right-backs,
restored the two goal lead. Johan
then had a chance to add to the score-
line, when we were awarded a penal-
ty kick. However, he opted instead
for a rather convincing impression of
Gareth Southgate.
All in all, this was a good result,,
thanks to a good combined perfor-
mance from the entire team.
I C BASKETBALL SECURES
NUMBER ONE SPOT
T MOURITIS
IC basketball Men's first team
secured thefirstplace in their group
last week, after crushing the (not par-
ticularly strong) resistance of St
George's Medical School. The dif-
ference in technical skills between
the players of the two team, strength-
ened by the fact that St George's
only came up with five players for
the match is mirrored on the final
score: an astonishing 105-28.
This would have been even bigger,
if we didn't have to get out of the
court as we were running out of time.
The next match for the team will be
an away play-off, probably against
King's college, later today. A victory
will put IC through to the BUSA last
32.
If you would fancy watching a
strong basketball match involving
your university team, check our
noticeboard for the details.
The Men's second team, unfortu-
nately, paired their defeats, this time
by QMW 2nd. The performance was
much better than in the first match,
but the result was fair, as QMW were
stronger under the basket. Now the
Seconds have five home matches in a
row, and can perhaps change their
luck and performance.
M I X E D FORTUNES FOR I C
CROSS-COUNTRY
FOOTBALL SECONDS OVERCOME
BATTLING KING'S
The latest fixture in this seasons
cross-country championship saw
both of IC's teams journeying to
Wimbledon Common, where the
men could only put in a sub-standard
performance.
Good individual achievements
were let down by "A pint of what?"
Fishick. Gaffer, Ponytail and Three-
Cubed put in great showings, finish-
ing tenth, sixteenth and eighteenth
respectively, but our "star runner"
did not even bother to grace us with
his presence.
In spite of coming in a car, the
women mustered the energy to dom-
inate. Jennie won, again, and Maria
put in a good run, despite this being
herfirstrace this year.
"Yellow-arse" finally managed to
beat the guest seventy year-old run-
ner, by kicking his Zimmerframe
away. And where were the
Flowerpot Men? - out looking for
Wombles!
Yet another great day out was
assured, however, thanks to the bar-
maid with the short skirt at the Grid
Inn, who provided hours of entertain-
ment.
The most important day of the sea-
son so far ended in glorious victory
on and off the pitch for the IC
Seconds.
With the league stage of the
BUSA cup on a knife-edge, "IC
Slags" needed a win to secure a place
in the next round. A depleted IC side
had lost 3-0 to King's last Saturday -
today grit and determination were
needed to ensure a return victory,
and we showed both.
The first half was scrappy and
sadly disrupted by a King's midfield-
er who was clearly there to foul, dive
- and not much else. Unfortunately,
with the referee struggling to main-
tain control German, our bruising
Georgian defender, took matters into
his own hands in an incident that
earned both players involved a book-
ing.
A rousing half-time speech from
captain marvel Steve stirred our
blood and within minutes we were
on top thanks to our deadly duo up
front. A through ball from the mighty
Robo put Alex in to score, and this
was rapidly followed up when a deep
cross let Martin head neatly back
across goal and into the net. There
then followed a period of consolida-
tion with our back four of Blondie,
Will, German and Phil "the pill" con-
trolling play, and effectively block-
ing King's from taking any initiative.
A rare defensive lapse let King's
pull one back and the game caught
fire. Both sides put in a mighty effort
but our class showed through as the
ball was worked around their area to
Felix, who produced a sensational
strike into the top corner - rippling
the net and breaking King's hearts.
The game ended with the dismissal
of their midfielder, whose conduct
throughout the match was nothing
short of disgraceful.
The victory was topped off in
Southside bar later in the evening as
the IC footballers faced up to IC
rugby club in a seven-man boat race.
Naturally, we emerged triumphant.
All in all, a great day for IC
Seconds.
