Unions' strike success paralyses Imperial
MATTHEW BENNETT A N D
M A E V E C A R E Y
Although Imperial was not one of the
most active colleges involved in
Tuesday's strike, it would have been
difficult to notice that virtually the
whole of the College had been shut
down. Few lectures and tutorials took
place, most of which were taken by
staff who were officially on strike,
but who had decided to teach without
receiving pay.
An estimated 600 technical and
support staff joined the majority of
the teaching staff striking over their
proposed payriseof 1.5%. The even-
tual outcome of the strike can not be
known at present, but there was a
feeling among those on the picket
lines that the level of anger reflected
by so many people from higher edu-
cation striking at once must have a
positive effect on the profile of
Higher Education. Unfortunately, the
strike coincided with a fire in the
Channel Tunnel and the year's first
snow, so national news coverage was
brief at the best.
Many people, from technicians to
lecturers braved the freezing wind
and sleet to be outside Imperial as
early as 7am. Strikers stood around
in rather uneasy lines handing out
leaflets and carrying placards; it was
immediately obvious that these peo-
ple were not used to striking, or tak-
ing any sort of action. No attempt
was made to stop people from getting
into the College, unlike at some insti-
tutions where post was prevented
from getting in (though none was
delivered within IC yesterday), or
milkmen turned away.
Union leaders continued to
emphasise the need for better staff
pay, but those on the picket lines saw
the occasion as one to express anger
at the lack of funding for Higher

simply staff pay. Speaking to Felix,
picketers revealed a whole range of
reasons as to why the strikes were
taking place. For one man, a member
of the MSF (Management, Science
and Finance workers union), it
seemed simply to be a case of "The
majority of the union voted for a
strike, and I'm a democrat." Many
felt that the strike was not about their
own pay, but about the quality of
Higher Education, which was seen as
suffering due to lack of funding and
several commented that they were
supporting the students too by their
action.
One striker said "The whole of HE
is screwed" due to Government cuts.
He expressed feelings of demoralisa-
tion among workers over a system
that forced workers to apply for
grants to pay their own salary. The
same man has been on short term
contracts at IC for eight years, and is
reluctantly leaving HE for a perma-
Bryon Wilson, president of
ICAUT (Imperial College
Association of University Teachers)
said that they were "leaning over
backwards not to affect students too
much" in their effort to get better pay
for staff, which is seen as a way of
raising moral and standards in
Universities. Those on the picket line
were more candid, pointing out that
"students wouldn't think twice about
missing lectures if they had been out
on the piss" and did not feel that
missing one day would affect them
much. Some picketers expressed dis-
may that there were so many students
coming in to College during the
strike, a move that was felt to be con-
trary to the strike's aim. The majori-
ty of these students claimed to be at
College to use the computer facili-
ties.
Speaking to Felix, Caroline Fox,
College's Head of Personnel,
explained that while the College sup-
ported the unions' stance in princi-
ple, they were sticking to the nation-
wide position agreed by the CVCP to
remain united to granting employees
more than a 1.5% pay deal without
further cash from the Government.
Amongst strikers, the feeling was
that the quality of teaching would fall
if funds continued to be withdrawn,
particularly with student numbers
increasing. The state of outdated lab
equipment was also seen as a major
problem.
The major feeling was that losing
one day's pay was an investment into
the future of higher education.
Campaigners felt that the less pay
staff get, the less students get out of
them.
The issue of where deducted staff
pay will go has still not been
resolved, as the number of strikers is
not yet known. The AUT did ask uni-
versities to donate money to their stu-
dent hardship funds, but while UCL,
the University of East Anglia and
Salford University have all pledged
to do this, IC seems to have decided
that to do this would be illegal, as the
funds were allotted to staff pay.
The strike was timed to come after
the beginning of term, to avoid dis-
ruption to Freshers settling in, but
before next Tuesday's budget. The
unions lobbied parliament at the beg-
ging of the summer, and have been
waiting since then to strike.
One picket claimed that a group of
Japanese university vice chancellors
had come to look at how the British
university system was run. The date
they chose? Tuesday 19 November.
As a follow up to the strike on
Tuesday, the unions are proposing a
"Boycott of Bureaucracy", to start
from last Wednesday. This will
involve targeting the teaching quality
