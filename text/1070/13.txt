14 CROSSWORD FELIX FRIDAY 22ND NOVEMBER
BUILDING BLOCKS BY CLANSMAN AND COBRA Puzzle E: Puzzle H:
Look at the example given
below:
t
at
eat
date
stead
In getting from one word to the
next, one letter is added and, when
necessary, an anagram is done to
form a new word. In the process,
the words get longer and longer
until the final word (in this case
"stead") is reached. At each stage,
the letters used must form a proper
word. Using the example above as
a basis, can you get from the start-
ing letter to the final word in each
of the puzzles given on the right? A
list of rules is given to the right.
Thanks to astra for the original
idea.
Rules:
1. Add one letter and do an ana-
gram of the letters (when and if
necessary) to create a new word,
and continue in this manner until
the final word is obtained (the first
letter and last word are given).
2. Proper nouns are allowed, but
should be avoided if possible (all
the puzzles in this edition can be
completed without the use of prop-
er nouns).
3. A word may not be converted
into it's immediate plural (e.g. in
the example given, date may not be
converted into dates). However,
plurals are allowed if an anagram
has taken place to make it (e.g. live
—
> veils). Adding an "s" is allowed
if it does not create a plural (e.g.
require —> requires).
4. No apostraphes or hyphenated
words may be used.
5. Only words that are in com-
mon use in the English language
may be used, so for example "psi"
can be used as although it is strictly
speaking Greek, it is in use, for
example, in many science subjects.
