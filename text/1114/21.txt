ACROSS THE BRIDGE
New End Theatre
lifer*
A
pril 1945: The war is end-
ing, and the Germans, keen
for their atrocities to remain
hidden, evacuate the Death
camps. Thousands of weak and
starving Jewish w o m e n and chil-
dren are forced to march to
Liepzig, to go across the bridge to
freedom. M a n y never make it;
s o m e die of starvation, some of
exhaustion, those w h o fall out of
line are shot or beaten to death.
The only food they were given was
a handful of raw rice, which they
had to queue for. The only way
they survived was through their
immense willpower and faith.
Traumatised for years, the sur-
vivors continued to suffer the
after-effects of their ordeal. Like in
the trenches of the First World
War, the lucky ones died.
This powerful and evocative
play tells the story of two of the
survivors, w h o meet up for the
first time in the Beth Salom
Holocaust M e m o r i a l Centre fifty-
one years. Both are severely trau-
matised by the terrible experiences
they have shared, both denied the
Holocaust by not speaking about
it, or admitting that it had hap-
pened to them, both are relieved
to speak to each other, to share
their burdens which no one else
could ever comprehend. The play
recounts their meeting, through
lighting, through sound, through
clever staging. It is a moving expe-
rience, and the entire audience
was weeping by the end.
The sufferings that these peo-
ple went through cause anything
w e suffer to pale into almost
insignificance. The Holocaust is a
period of history that future gener-
ations will look back at in disbelief.
H o w did it happen? W h y did it
happen? The consequences still
reverberate in the Jewish c o m m u -
nity today; s o m e w o u n d s never
heal.
The play will cause y o u to
think deeply, to look at your o w n
treatment towards others. W e
today are fortunate in that w e live
in a time of comparative stability,
of comparative tolerance towards
others, especially in this country. It
is vital that we maintain this stabil-
ity, however precarious it might
seem, lest w e fall prey to a new
regime of dictators. Please go and
see this play, it is so important to
everyone. It is not strictly enjoy-
able, but it will give y o u much to
think about.

BOTTLED NOTES FROM UNDERGROUND:
CONTEMPORARY PLAYS BY JEWISH WRITERS
I
n my vain attempts to broaden
my mind, I read all of these
plays at a sitting, in bed whilst
nursing a hangover. By the end of
the book, I was not only feeling
better, but I had far more of an idea
about the Jewish condition, if I can
call it that. For all my studying of
GCSE history, 1 really had no idea of
the impact that the Holocaust had
on people's lives, nor h o w bad the
troubles in Israel really were for the
people living there. N o w , with
Israel celebrating 50 years of self-
determination, and rumours of a
possible peace settlement in the
wind, it seems pertinent to write
about the current state of Israel
and Jewish people.
Since I started reading Brecht
during last summer, I have b e c o m e
increasingly m o r e interested in
Jewish writers and writings.
Obviously, no people can escape
their past, and the great strength
and courage of German, Austrian
and Polish Jews never ceases to
amaze me. The tortures they suf-
fered were i m m e n s e , a n d still
reverberate in the c o m m u n i t y
today, both in the survivors and in
their children.
Each of the featured play-
wrights are award-winning writers
in their field. Sonja Linden, one of
the playwrights, the author of The
Jewish Daughter, featured in Felix
1101, has written a passionate and
difficult play, called Strange
Passenger, about the life of the
composer Victor Ullman. This play
is multi-faceted, and extremely
c o m p l i c a t e d , as well as being
excellent.
The most amusing play is a
black c o m e d y by David Scheider
called The Eleventh
Commandment, about a g o o d
Jewish boy, w h o falls for an atheist
girl. Concerning the relationship
with his mother, this is a funny and
intelligent debut play, with surreal
aspects generally only found in
Tom Stoppard's works.
M y favourite play was the first
one, The Yiddish Trojan Women,
c o n c e r n i n g the relationship
between four w o m e n , a grand-
mother, a stand-up comic, a union-
ist a n d a teacher of Greek
M y t h o l o g y . This play by Carole
Braverman, revives the tragic clas-
sical story by Euripides, but sets it
in m o d e r n N e w York.
All the works in this book are
sensitively written, thoughtful,
poignant and in places, extremely
funny. I don't know if many would
be interested in this book, all I can
do is to tell y o u about it, and help
publicise future performances. The
works are worth getting to know:
the Holocaust was a such a huge
part of our history, and a terrible
example of man's inhumanity to
man. I think that Jewish people
would appreciate these plays the
most, but 1 think that everyone
should become familiar with some
Jewish writers, in order to appreci-
ate a different slant on life.
