onesty is always the best
policy, and not wishing to
deceive the gentle reader,
I'll say what 1 think about this book
straight away. This book is really
poor.
People are interlinked. Bea's
best friend shagged Bea's
boyfriend's best mate, who's
defending Bea's boyfriend's ex-flat-
mate o n a charge of raping some-
one w h o just might turn out to be
Bea's best friend, w h o picks up
m e n at random, w h o lives with her
sugar d a d d y , who's wife's best
friend's g o d s o n is accused of raping
Bea's best friend, w h o recently
appeared, in her scanties, in a
series of articles about so-called
rape victims by Bea's slimy, treach-
erous ex-boyfriend, w h o knows
Bea's boyfriend's current flatmate,
who bet Bea's boyfriend that he,
Bea's boyfriend's current flatmate,
could bed Bea's unattractive flat-
mate, w h o is a psychic in her spare
time and told Bea that her future
involved two men, so now Bea's
sure that her current boyfriend w h o
she loves will d u m p her, and that
her slimy, treacherous ex-
boyfriend, w h o she doesn't love,
will shag her and d u m p her again.
The book, however, doesn't make
this as clear as it is here.
Sucker is a first novel about
London and 90's Londoners. Two
of the protagonists are Irish-
Catholic girls, presumably like Lana
Citron, and the others can loosely
be described as their m e n .
Obviously, Sucker doesn't refer to
cute little girls with lollipops,
although the heroine does dress up
to attract semi-paedophilic m e n by
wearing a tight tee-shirt and hair
slides. She pulls a yob, apparently
her type, although I preferred the
sophistication of Bea's boyfriend's
divorced best friend, w h o I think
she ends up with. 1 don't want to
spoil the ending for y o u , though.
According to the press release,
the book tears a strip off the pre-
tensions of 1990s twenty-some-
things, and provides a blistering
insight into the dating game and
the darker side of the sex-war. By
that, I think they mean that one of
the girls isn't afraid to use her sex-
uality as a w e a p o n , and the other is
keener to shack up/marry s o m e o n e
and give up thinking. I preferred the
powerful one, although I kept on
wanting to tell her to grow up. O h
well. Obviously I'm part of the pre-
tentious media/PR world that M s
Citron is so keen to distance herself
from.
This isn't really a great book. It's
quite well written, and it's certainly
both confusing and entertaining, as
well as being fast-paced and effort-
lessly m o d e r n in it's style. With
summer c o m i n g up, and the mass
exodus of sun-seekers, it'll probably
sell well to the reading on the
beach public. I wouldn't recom-
m e n d it as a serious piece of fiction
for the discerning reader, though. If
you buy it, then you're the sucker
and deserve everything you get.
You have been warned.

EVERYTHING WE LOVE CAN BE SAVED
Alice Walker
YTiiiNG W E lovt: (.;
AS
m
lice Walker is a writer of
integrity; a w o m a n i s t , an
i.activist, a believer in the
G o d d e s s and a truly wonderful,
beautiful person. Her writing covers
a great deal, from fiction to essays,
prose to poetry. M o s t people will
be familiar with at least the title of
her most famous book, The Colour
Purple, a semi-biographical story of
w o m e n of colour in the American
Deep South. This was later made
into a film by Steven Spielberg,
starring another wonderful w o m a n
of colour, W h o o p i Goldberg.
In this collection of essays, she
writes about a wide spectrum of
topics, essays on the Gulf War,
female genital mutilation, Winnie
Mandeta, Fidel Castro, dreadlocks
and her cat. She includes s o m e
poetry, in a selection entitled "What
Can I Give M y Daughters W h o Are
Brave?". The poems she chooses
are poignant and have echoes in all
our lives. Every sentence she writes
shows her humanity, her compas-
sion and her believe in the deep
g o o d of people, despite all the evils
she sees in life; racism, sexism and
oppression.
As a w o m a n of colour growing
up in the American Deep South
during the period of A m e r i c a n
apartheid, she knew poverty, vio-
lence and discomfort. Yet she also
k n e w love and tolerance. Her
mother was clearly a potent force
in her life, and her death obviously
had a great effect on her. M a n y of
her essays feature a caring mother-
figure, w h o nurtures and protects,
and stress her importance in all our
lives. Our mothers teach us how to
live, and how to die.
Alice Walker doesn't like to be
called a feminist, preferring w o m -
anist, because she acts for w o m e n .
She is acutely aware of the dangers
to w o m e n of a patriarchal, or a
male dominated society. Where-
ever w o m e n are suppressed or
oppressed, she will be there speak-
ing out for them. She is a strong
critic of American foreign policies,
especially their blockade of Cuba
and the Gulf War. As she says, "If I
would rather die myself than run
over a child in the street, h o w can 1
possibly accept squashing a million
children from forty thousand feet,
as in Iraq?"
This is not a "mainstream" book.
It will not appeal to many of y o u at
first glance. Reading it, however,
you feel its' power, and its' passion.
This book is extremely important to
w o m e n , to m e n , to everyone w h o
thinks and feels, and w h o can see
the injustices in the world. I was
profoundly m o v e d by many of her
essays, and found myself laughing
aloud over others. This book will
make y o u want to be a better,
more thoughtful, more caring per-
son. I strongly r e c o m m e n d it.
