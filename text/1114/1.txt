IC Suffers Worst Ever
News Drought
ALI CAMPBELL
This week, Imperial College was
struck by the worst news drought
for a g o o d fifty years, rendering the
front page of Felix little more than
an amusing waste of space.
The problem began when Jeremy
T h o m s o n , editor of the publication,
noticed that the vibrant and inter-
esting stories with which the office
is usually peppered had dried up
c o m p l e t e l y , with the p r o b l e m
reaching an unhappy climax just
two hours before Felix went to
print.
T h o m s o n was quoted as say-
ing, "I think this is extremely irre-
sponsible behaviour on the part of
the students at this university. I
k n o w that many p e o p l e have
examinations at this time of year,
but y o u would think that at least a
Andy Heeps: Nothing to Report
few people might do something
vaguely news-worthy. W e haven't
even had reports of missing traffic
cones, w h i c h frankly are ten a
penny."
Panic subsequently gripped the
office as all emergency investiga-
tions drew a blank. Extraordinary
consultations with Union officials
produced little more information
than, "Bugger off, I'm working". At
the eleventh hour, it was a certain
dashing y o u n g journalist w h o saved
the day again by writing two hun-
dred words of nonsense.
This occurrence adds weight to
the allegations that Imperial
College, having recently risen
above Oxford to second place in
the Financial Times' university rank-
ings, now houses the second most
boring campus inhabitants in the
country.
NUS Conference decends in to
Tribalism
NEWSTEAM
The annual conference of the
National Union of Students last
m o n t h c r u m b l e d into an angry
slanging match between the divid-
ed student parties. Speeches by
both the columnist Peter Hitchins
and N U S president D o u g Trainer
incited demonstration and abuse
so vocal that police and security
were called on to restore order and
eventually break up the conference.
The main source of friction was the
increasing challenge to Labour
Student's domination of the N U S
f r o m the C a m p a i g n for Free
Education. Several key positions,
including National Treasurer, have
shifted to CFE candidates, and
Labour Students fear further losses
next year.
Outgoing NUS President
Douglas Trainer
The CFE's key priority is the aboli-
tion tuition fees - an issue on which
the N U S have been widely criti-
cised for their lack of successful
action. However, the newly elected
president A n d r e w Pakes (this year's
National Treasurer), claimed that
he had personally lobbied Labour
M P s over the issue and defended
the N U S 1
position. In contrast, the
CFE announced the launch of their
new anti-fees campaign "Can't Pay,
Won't Pay", in which they hope to
obtain 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 pledges from
future students to default on their
payments.
The conference ended with almost
the entire 2000-strong delegation
on their feet and shouting during
Douglas Trainer's retirement
speech, which came to a climax
w h e n he a c c u s e d the Socialist
Worker Party of being "paper-sell-
ing loonies."
