Bomb Scare
Threatens Final
JEREMY THOMSON
IC security, the police and the
Bomb Squad were all involved in
an operation to defuse a bomb in
the Sherfield Building last Friday.
Security received an anonymous
tip-off at a p p r o x i m a t e l y 11am,
informing them that an explosive
device had been placed in the
women's toilets on level three of
the Sherfield Building. Security
investigated, saw the device and
decided to empty the building until
it had been made safe. The police
were called in, and all the nearby
administrative staff were evacuat-
ed. At the time, final year biology
students were sitting exams in the
Great Hall. However, it was decid-
ed to leave them undisturbed as
they were d e e m e d to be a safe dis-
tance from the suspected bomb.
O n investigation, the Bomb Squad
discovered the object to be a fake,
constructed of aluminium cans and
foil. "It was a definite attempt to
imitate a bomb", said Ken Weir,
Chief Security Officer.
Although the incident is under
investigation and fingerprints are
being studied, there is little chance
of identifying the perpetrator. The
possibility that the scare was a
deliberate attempt to disrupt the
examinations has not been ruled
out.
Ken Weir has requested that
students d o not leave their person-
al belongings outside the Great Hall
during the exam period. He also
reminded students to take all their
belongings with them at the end of
the exam, especially swipe cards,
which have been left behind sever-
al times this term.
News in Brief...
COMPUTER
THEFTS STOPPED
Two thieves were disturbed dur-
ing an attempted robbery in the
Electrical Engineering building last
Thursday night, preventing the
loss of thousands of p o u n d s '
worth of computer equipment.
The men had broken in to an IT
lab on the eight floor, and had
begun to remove computers from
the desks ready to carry them
from the building when a security
officer w h o was locking up
entered the area. The department
was quickly sealed off, but the
thieves managed to exit the build-
ing and hid in Ayrton Road. A
chase ensued, but the m e n
e s c a p e d . It is thought that
although the robbers knew where
to find the e q u i p m e n t , they
lacked detailed knowledge of the
building
TOP-UP FEES
DANGER
Students are once again facing
the prospect of top-up fees as
M P s v o t e d to overturn critical
amendments m a d e by the House
of Lords in the Teaching and
Higher Education Bill. Amongst
other changes, the peers voted to
continue m e a n s - t e s t e d main-
tenants grants for students and
specifically prohibit universities
from charging their o w n top-up
fees. The clause has n o w been
modified so that an institution
may charge extra fees if they can
provide satisfactory justification.
The bill, w h i c h has n o w
reached report stage and will
return to the H o u s e of Lords next
month, can be read at www.par-

Researchers "to Cure Cancer in Two Yearsrr
ED SEXTON
The last few weeks have seen a
deluge of publicity concerning
possible cures for cancer.
This week international head-
lines reported the success of an
A m e r i c a n g r o u p in eradicating
tumours in mice. The research
team, w h o are based in Boston,
have p r o d u c e d a d r u g cocktail
which reduces the blood supply to
developing tumours.
The cocktail consists of two
drugs, endostatin and angiostatin,
that seem to work synergistically in
preventing blood vessels from sup-
plying cancerous growths. Not
only does this starve the tumour of
essential nutrients, but it also pre-
vents the spread of cancer cells, so
the tumour remains benign. Dr
Judah Folkman, pioneer of the new
treatment, has been cautious about
its effectiveness in humans, but this
hasn't stopped a human trial being
organised for the c o m i n g year. N o r
has it s t o p p e d share prices in
EntreMed Inc, the c o m p a n y with
the rights to the two drugs, from
soaring this m o n t h . M e d i a atten-
tion has been further intensified by
the comments of Dr James W a t s o n ,
the Nobel laureate w h o discovered
the structure of D N A : H e told a
reporter for the N e w York Times
"Judah is going to cure cancer in
two years."
Then it was the turn of the
Imperial Cancer Research Fund.
Researchers in Dundee have isolat-
ed a single gene (again in mice)
that seems to be crucial in prevent-
ing damage from carcinogens. The
gene is particularly important in the
lungs and bladder, two tissues that
are often sites of smoking-related
cancers. Individuals with 'faulty'
copies of the gene are more likely
to develop cancers than those with
functional copies. The finding
could also allow the use of genetic
engineering to prevent certain can-
cers. Although the British research
has not received the media atten-
tion of the Boston group, both are
significant d e v e l o p m e n t s in the
fight against cancer.
M e a n w h i l e the Cancer
Research Campaign is concentrat-
ing o n another drug,
Combretastatin A 4 , which is similar
in effect to the endostatin-angio-
statin combination. H u m a n trials
are due to begin in November,
before the American trial begins.
While Dr Watson's comments
may be over-optimistic, w e can
expect a variety of new therapies
and treatments to become avail-
able early in the new millenium.
The holy grail of 'a cure for cancer'
is still out of reach, but perhaps not
out of sight. O u r understanding of
cancer is growing at an exponential
rate and, although media hype may
be raising false hopes once again, it
seems that a cure for cancer may
be a viable possibility within the
next decade. With a third of all
Westerners suffering from cancer
at some point in their lives, that has
to be g o o d news.
