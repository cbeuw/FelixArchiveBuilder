T;
hose hammering and chis-
elling carpenters aren't
famous for their musical abil-
ity. Not unless their name is Karen
or Richard. O r not unless they were
the singing sensation that w a s
Jesus Christ Superstar, w h o learnt
all he knew from his carpenter dad.
But you get my point: a carpenter is
unlikely to change the sphere of
music. However, what if y o u were
carpenter to The Beastie Boys? A n d
they took a shine to your secret
passion in analogue keyboard
tweaking? A n d y o u went on to play
on their records and steer them
towards their current cool-standing
as leaders of America's alternative
scene? W e l l , y o u ' d be M o n e y
Mark.
M a r k Ramos-Nishita (renamed
M o n e y M a r k by The Beastie Boys)
is a half-Mexican, half-Japanese
lover of old technology. H e says of
his primitive keyboards, "It's some-
thing I can repair on my o w n , that's
what I feel m o s t comfortable
about. I have little relationships
with my keyboards." This is just
one factor that has made him steer
clear of the digital revolution, "It's
hard for me to deal with this new
w o r l d , this new technology."
Justifiably, then, his music is of a
definite " l o - f i " nature. H e gets
immense pleasure out of creating
strange new sounds and incorpo-
rating them into his songs. Even
this new album arrives in suitably
lo-fi packaging, using the bare min-
imum of cardboard and plastic.
You've most probably heard of
M o n e y M a r k from his recent single,
the wonderful (yet strangely Top
40-shy) Hand In Your Head. This
track manages to mix bouncing
rhythm, g o o d - t i m e keyboard
chords a n d assured, enticing
singing with lyrics which are inven-
tive whilst still naive. In short, a sur-
prising feel-good p o p record. It
even features Sean "Son of John"
Lennon on bass guitar, M a r k ' s only
collaboration on the album.
While few, if any, tracks on
Push The Button are as amazing as
Hand In Your Head, the album is lit-
tered with magic moments. There
are enough experimental pieces,
like the title track and the space
invaders march of Destroyer, to
satisfy any doubters of M o n e y
Mark's inventiveness. But it is the
"proper" songs that steal the show.
Too Like You is a well-crafted tune
that can be placed alongside any
slice of '60's b e a t - p o p . The
euphoric Tomorrow Will Be Like
Today reprises Elvis Costello. A n d
Rock In The Rain and / Don't Play
Piano are heartfelt odes filled with
lilting melodies.
N o one was expecting this from
M o n e y M a r k . A collection of quirky
samples would have satisfied most.
But this album contains diverse
songs filled w i t h the so-called
"hum" factor - y o u can't get the
catchy tunes out of your head. Like
the lounge lizard cry of "All the
p e o p l e in the w o r l d ! " ; or the
strained, driving bassline in forth-
c o m i n g single Maybe I'm Dead; or
the a w e s o m e concoction that is
Powerhouse: on the surface organ-
led d r u m ' n ' b a s s m a y h e m , but
beneath that a carnival of bossa
nova.
For what is his first proper stu-
dio album (previous efforts were
d e m o s of age-old compositions)
M o n e y M a r k has made a remark-
able achievement. H e even found
himself a singing voice - reserved
and unforced. The sheer experi-
mentation of this album may initial-
ly put some off, but a few listens
and you're drawn in. d

F
rank Black, former lead singer
of the highly acclaimed Pixies
has finally gone solo for the
fourth time, 'Hurrah' I hear y o u
shout. This s u p p o s e d l y blues
album is meant to take over where
the Pixies left off, sounding fresher
and more modern, but manages to
bomb out.
This album has been produced
almost on auto pilot, every s o n g is
uninspired and seems to be trying
to just tap into what the Pixies
once had, but as a result just
sounds rehashed, predictable and
unoriginal. The album was record-
ed over a space of three days and
it shows. There's a feel that he's
just slapped together music he's
used to in an attempt that it might
actually w o r k , but it gives the
album a feel of one long m o n o t o -
nous drone.
If we had just heard the backing
by itself, we would pray to carry
this album, and although his voice
is clearly needed it seems to drag
the album d o w n even more when
the listener just wants him to give
them some sort of a tune.
If y o u liked the Pixies, there's
no guarantee that you will like this
album, as it's too much the same
throughout. If you've heard any of
the songs from the album, then
you will probably like the entire
album, but only in the same way
we all loved those 1 7 re-mixes of
Robert Miles's Children. This album
is Black in that its so bland it lacks
anything uplifting like a melody, but
is it Frank? Well only in Cockney
rhyming slang, d
David H.
G
ang Starr are back with their
hotly awaited new album
Moment of Truth. G o o d
news for the hardcore fans is that
not m u c h has really changed as
Guru states on the intro to the fine
first track, You Know my Steez, 'we
had the right idea at the begin-
ning...the rhyme style is elevated,
the style of beats is elevated but
it's still Guru and Premier...' A n d it
most certainly is, Moment of Truth
is a return to Gang Starr's best.
Guru's deep monotone vocals lace
and loop between s o m e of DJ
Premier's best tunes to date.
There is s o m e w h a t of a
dichotomy in the album though.
O n the one hand Gang Starr in
tracks like, Robbin Hood Theory,
New York Strait Talk and Above the
Clouds, which features Inspectah
Deck of the W u - T a n g Clan, main-
tain their usual slightly more hard-
core East Coast sound but the gen-
eral feel of the whole album is
more of a m e l l o w West Coast
groove. Summery piano tunes float
over laid back, deep hip hop beats
with sweet female vocals looping
around in the background on many
of the tracks. All this leads to a bril-
liant album that not so much grabs
you and shakes y o u about but mas-
sages your mind and before you
know it y o u are caught up swaying
side to side head bobbing to the
addictive hook and beat.
However the stand out tunes
for me. The Militia and the best
track on the album The Rep Crows
Bigga, are the darker more hard
sounding tracks. This is a truly
excellent album that anyone who
knows their hip hop will buy. This
Gang get five Starrs. CI
