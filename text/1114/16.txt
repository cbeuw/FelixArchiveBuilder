C L U B S C E N E
Hi and welcome to the first Electric Cafe of
the s u m m e r t e r m ! If y o u ' r e feeling d o w n
because of the pressures of exams and final
reports, etc we'll be bringing y o u a respite in
the form of electronic music news, reviews,
artist features and s o m e great C D competitions!
If you're interested in features that will be
appearing in the Cafe this term, then look out in
Felix for exclusive interviews with Colin Dale of
Kiss F M ' s Abstrakt Dance show, Russ Gabriel of
Ferox Records, King Kooba (who's album The
Imperial Solution is a s t o r m i n g w o r k of
drum'n'bass and was launched recently at The
Blue Note in London), Air Liquide (the German
techno outfit w h o played at London's very cool
333 Club in February) and (to be confirmed) Jeff
Mills, a legendary DJ and producer from Detroit.
Everyone w h o features in the Electric Cafe
on these pages will also be doing radio shows
which y o u can listen to every Sunday
night/Monday m o r n i n g o n IC Radio (The
Network) from midnight to 2 a m . H a p p y reading
and listening!
Those of y o u w h o c a m e d o w n to the Electric
Cafe nights at Southside last term will be inter-
ested to know that The Electric Cafe is moving
across Campus to IC Union for a special one-off
session on Friday 22nd M a y . I'll be playing the
chill-out r o o m of the Hedonizm night. If you're
interested in listening and chilling to a variety of
cutting-edge electronic music, then c o m e along
for a break from those exams. The main floor
will be in the very capable hands of the regular
union dance DJs mixing up a selection of harder
beats.
This week I wanted to carry on where I left
off last term. Drum'n'bass is mainly regarded as
a musical style that was born and bred in the
UK, and quite rightly so. However, it
seems that recently there has been a
lot of British snobbery directed at
music of this genre that has been
coming out of Europe and the US
lately. If music is really an art form
then I think that this is not in the spir-
it of creation, and not really helping
young producers and DJs w h o have
obviously been inspired and m o v e d
to carry on the progression of new
sound form.
Last term I featured an interview
from Fauna Flash, Germany's most
successful drum'n'bass exports w h o
have been largely ignored. This week-
end I wanted to talk about a great
new album called Play on Sideburn
Records.
Play is a collection of tracks that
can best be categorised as falling
within or being closely aligned to the
drum'n'bass category of electronic
music. All the artists w h o have c o n -
tributed tracks c o m e f r o m
Switzerland. I think that y o u w o u l d
be hard pressed to find a fresher col-
lection of new music. All the pieces
on the album follow the formula of
drum'n'bass or hip-hop, but all have
a distinctly different atmosphere to
them. I a m also particularly grateful
the electric cam
to have this album in my collection, because
unlike a lot of dance fodder around today, this
is a multi-purpose music. The first techno that
really grabbed me was music that I felt had been
created by artists w h o wanted to move people
and make them dance, but also wanted to trig-
ger their minds and emotions. All the music y o u
will find on Play is in this vein.
Play has been put together by a Zurich-
based DJ called Minus 8. W a t c h out for that
name because if his mixing is as g o o d as his
track selection then I'm sure that he'll be play-
ing in London soon! Minus 8 also produced
some of the tracks featured on the album.
In fact the compilation kicks off with a Minus
8 production called Recently at The Opera. This
features all the usual hallmarks of drum'n'bass
music; a solid bassline, frantic bursts of hi-hat
and complex rhythm patterns. It's what appears
underneath the structure of the piece that really
grabbed me! I had imagined that this compila-
tion would be made up of some banging tracks
put together by Swiss kids in their bedroom w h o
had perhaps heard all the more hardcore
drum'n'bass. In fact the maturity and subtlety of
the m o o d s of the tracks on offer here are, at
times, simply breathtaking! Recently at the
Opera features delicate snatches of orchestral
samples, infused with light electronic sounds.
The result is a m o o d y but extremely listenable
piece of music.
The next track (Not enough Love by M a s - P ) ,
again has an energetic beat and bassline, but
with some light and fluffy sounds complement-
ing a female vocal track, the result is a piece that
can move your butt, or create a chilled-out
atmosphere.
As well as drum'n'bass, this album features
s o m e great hybrid sounds. Twists of hip-
hop and funk with generous additions of break-
beats. Captain N e m o ' s Escape is an excellent
example. Check out the combination of French
ragga vocals and a Spanish guitar! Strange, but it
works. Le Gooster has produced a piece called
Le Fusee a Polo. S o m e very disturbed and twist-
ed jazz sounds collide and react with a laid-back
hip-hip beat. O n c e given the "Gooster treat-
ment", and mixed with generous portions of live
scratching you have a track that would sit
proudly on any beats'n'blunts album from the
UK or US.
O n e of my favourite tracks here is from Bel
Air Project, a personal favourite of DJ Giles
Peterson. The piece is called Full Contact and is
completely fresh in, not only its sound, but it's
approach to the creation of music. It is as if all
rules and accepted practices were thrown out of
the w i n d o w in the quest for a totally new, don't-
give-a-fuck-sound. This track is definitely ahead
of the pack; not quite drum'n'bass, not quite
breakbeats; but w h o needs to catagorise it?; it's
a treat to listen to!
Spacious by Differenz is another awesome
yet unusual track. If soul music could be trans-
lated into computer code then this would be it!
Very chilled m u s i c with plenty of subtle
melodies floating around dreamily; all held
together with a strong rhythm. 1 can't easily
describe this track, you'll just have to listen for
yourselves!
Minus 8's second track of the album is
called A Touch of Evil. It starts off as a t y p i c a l .
piece of jazzy drum'n'bass, but then some quite
abstract and smooth string sounds completely
turn the trek on its head. Excellent!
M o r e drum'n'bass follows, in the form of
tracks from Skrupel and The Herbalist
Foundation P. Brotherhood. 1 was
particularly impressed by the work of
The Herbalist Foundation. The track
they produced is called Summertime
and, although strictly a drum'n'bass
affair, features s o m e really c o o l
blunted effects o n the rhythm that
gives a less clean but more laid-back
feel. Not hectic; not booming; this is
music with a groove!
The album c o m e s to an end with
two real treats. First Up is A M P ' s Is
Isn't, a real technoid piece of d'n'b
with some really nice variations in
rhythm. Again this ties ties in with the
m o o d of the album; groovy not slam-
ming! 4D from Super is a real trip!
This is as experimental as you can
get in hip-hop, so if you're tired of
the same old thing in that genre, d o
check this out! The track is hypnotic
and very relaxed w i t h different
sounds drifting in and out of the
audio h o r i z o n ! Very atmospheric
stuff.
If you're looking for something
different that is pushing forward
musical boundaries a n d that will
challenge your tastes, then d o check
out the sound of Switzerland!
al;ck.
