or m e it was Prayers on Fire
and High Land Hard Rain.
That pivotal m o m e n t in m y
formative years w h e n I o p t e d out
of Nick Caves unstable world by
swapping the Birthday Party for
Aztec Camera. To this day I still
have a sneaking suspicion that Paul
got the better of the deal. That for
me was the m o m e n t I disengaged
the angry y o u n g m a n and inserted
ugly, unloved and hapless in its
place. A n d that place had no place
for Nick Cave.
Funny then that the Bad Seeds
should n o w fit so seamlessly into
my life, not that I have resorted to
past punk ideals, on the contrary, it
is because, although Nick Cave
may still have a fixation with death
(exorcised in some part by the
mighty Murder Ballads) he has
channelled his energies into creat-
ing s o m e of the most beautifully
loathsome lowlife with which to
recount his stories. A n d whilst he
takes the role of recalcitrant
preacher here or incestuous b u m p -
kin there, the rest of the Bad Seeds
p u m p out big bastard g o s p e l
melodies that G o d himself would
have wished to have had written
for him.
Not that there isn't a place for
love in the songs, it's just that
through the eyes of one of Caves
characters, love can be an infatua-
tion with the macabre, the innocent
or just the plain bizarre and some-
times it's difficult to tell one from
the other.
And when people sneer and say
that he sold out with Kylie, (includ-
ed here on the album) take a step
back and see it for what it is. Her
beauty to his beast. The perfect foil
for the master storyteller,
Inspirational. H

xamining the track listing for
this album, I began to suspect
that a playing time of 53:22
coupled with the inclusion of a
mere eight tracks meant a battery
of six-and-a-half minute epics with
far more space for solo-ing than
can really be considered healthy.
Having said that, the LP kicks off
with a mere three-minute piece of
riffola containing most of the ele-
ments that made M a i d e n famous
all those years ago. M y first impres-
sion, though, is that fizzy overpro-
duction robs the recording of the
rocking edge that people with black
clothes, chains and long hair found
so exquisite on Running Free.
Perhaps the members of the band
have sat o n one comfy sofa too
many in their old age, or maybe
they just m a d e the mistake of
recording at a studio in Essex.
W e plod through The Angel and
the Cambler, another track seem-
ingly performed in a shoe box,
before the trem-dives and minor
pentatonic scales rear their ugly
heads. Lightning Strikes Twice
grabs a few points back, with a
piece of guitar masturbation incor-
porating s o m e inexcusable har-
monic runs, which should please
any d i e - h a r d metal technician
requiring yet another M a i d e n
record.
So the standard is set for the
remainder of the songs, with all the
above continuing in equal measure.
If y o u already o w n all six thousand
previous I M albums, y o u will find
everything that was present on Iron
Maiden in similar fashion here,
ie magic ingre-
sd to create a
sequel? G o o d

The only feel
Scream2 soundtrack is that all
the tracks ha< • -:n to
appeal to the American M T V gen-
eration and not complement the
m o o d of the film, judging the
music without having seen the
film may seem a little harsh but it
artists and songs. Does any of it
send the :
r neck into an
scary thing about this soundtrack
is that all the tracks could have

albeit in a rather watered-down
guise. It just remains for y o u to
decide if y o u can extract anything
