SAUCY JACK AND THE SPACE VIXENS
Queen's Theatre
B
efore the s h o w started w e
were anticipating something
truly cosmic, as w e were
presented with a scene of stars and
spaceships. The programme c a m e
with a glossary of terms, which was
full of outrageous humour, and
promised a 'post m o d e r n musical
which raised an intergalactic fist up
at convention.'
What we got, however, was a
cross between a tame version of
the Rocky Horror Show a n d
Forbidden Planet that didn't really
work. The story was partly narrated
by an 'intergalactic' psychoanalyst,
a frequenter of Saucy Jack's, a
seedy bar where several cabaret
artists have recently been mur-
dered by the Slingback Killer, an
elusive character whose w e a p o n is
a sequinned stiletto.
To the rescue c o m e the appar-
ently telepathic Space Vixens, three
sassy disco divas w h o get a little
distracted from the job in hand
(ahem) by h a n d s o m e y o u n g
men/women. Through a stroke of
luck, one of the Space Vixens finds
out w h o the killer is, and the reper-
cussions of this change the lives of
all the characters.
The stellar landscape w a s
replaced by a cluttered and sup-
posedly sleazy bar that bore little
relevance to space and remained
the only scenery used throughout
the rest of the show. O n c e it found
its feet, the music was well per-
formed, funky and modern (includ-
ing an excellence sax solo) with a
refreshingly unsentimental and
unrefined feel.
The most memorable charac-
ter, Booby, the dreamy waitress
played by a man (David Ashley)
was the only really convincing char-
acter although the others, while
generally not making an impression
were at times very entertaining and
energetic. Ashley's part was not
overacted and he made the charac-
ter immediately likeable.
The story line, while light-heart-
edly kinky, was simple and yet not
clearly portrayed,making it surpris-
ingly hard to follow. Although in
parts very amusing, the majority of
the humour was cheap, 'Carry-On'
style innuendo, making it seem less
sentimental than most West-End
musicals, but it still lacked original-
ity - we'd heard it all before.
They did feel, however, that it
was necessary to include the stan-
dard recipe of boy/girl m e e t s
boy/girl (pick a combination) by
pairing off everyone at the end,
apparently merely to add some res-
olution to the thin plot. O n e of the
characters that was killed even
came back to life so that the vixen,
Bunny wouldn't be left alone.
Two out of the four couples
were homosexual which a d d e d to
the quirky and c a m p atmosphere,
especially since the two men 'came
out' as plastic fetishists half way
through. Perhaps better suited to
its original format as a fringe s h o w
in the Edinburgh Festival, we found
that it didn't quite succeed in the
West End and that it lacked sub-
stance. A s a bit of fun, however,
you'd be hard pressed to find any-
thing trashier. Its main virtue was
the music and the costumes too
were impressive (sci-fi/trendy).
W e reckon 6/10.
