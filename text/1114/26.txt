people i n her group of climbers were i n
a bad s t a t e . However, they would a l l only gat one day's r e s t b e f o r e the guides would
press ahead f o r the summit. They would go without s l e e p f o r f o r t y hours and she mumbled some-
t h i n g about b e i n g w o r r i e d about the amount of oxygen they were allowed to c a r r y . I knew that a
h e l i c o p t e r rescue at that a l t i t u d e was unthinkable.
I t was at t h a t p o i n t that worry began to turn i n t o genuine dread. D u r i n g a r a r e moment o f mental c l a r i t y I
sat down and attempted to imagine a world without Susan. That was f i n a l l y when I r e a l i s e d how much I had u n d e r e s t i -
mated my f e e l i n g s . Prom that stage onward, she was there i n my waking mind c o n s t a n t l y .
On the d e s i g n a t e d day o f her a s s a u l t on the summit my a l r e a d y s e v e r e l y a f f e c t e d a b i l i t y to concentrate broke down
completely. Ky attempts at doing any work were a f a r c e , and making some excuse, I l e f t the o f f i c e e a r l y . I was
p a i n f u l l y aware that no one seemed as w o r r i e d about Susan as I was. That n i g h t I d i d n ' t even pretend that I thought I
might get some s l e e p .
Susan reached the top o f Mount E v e r e s t w i t h seven o t h e r c l i m b e r s , two guides and f i v e sherpas. The climb had
gone smoothly and a c c o r d i n g to p l a n . I t was on the descent that the problems began. Prom what I had heard, at l e a s t
two o f the c l i m b e r s were r e a c h i n g u t t e r exhaustion at t h i s stage and began to s e v e r e l y hamper the climb. The guides
r e s o r t e d to the emergency measure o f i n j e c t i n g the small ampoule of c o r t i s o n e that every c l i m b e r c a r r i e d around
t h e i r neck. E x t r a oxygen was a l s o a d m i n i s t e r e d but i t appeared that they had taken a c t i o n too l a t e . A storm was
approaching and a l l they had time to do was to t r y and f i n d some s h e l t e r ; f a t a l l y inadequate s h e l t e r as i t turned
out. For twenty hours they had cowered i n temperatures o f minus s i x t y degrees c e n t i g r a d e , w a i t i n g f o r some improve-
ment i n the c o n d i t i o n s . Somehow, a r a d i o l i n k to base camp was e s t a b l i s h e d and a l l members o f the p a r t y were
allowed one s a t e l l i t e phone c a l l . A l l except three that i s , who were s u f f e r i n g from such extreme e x h a u s t i o n and
hypothermia t h a t they were unable to even speak. I l a t e r d i s c o v e r e d that one of them had l o s t a g l o v e a t t h i s stage
and that that hand was e f f e c t i v e l y a l r e a d y l o s t . Susan t r i e d to phone her parents but a f t e r she had f a i l e d to get
through had c a l l e d me. Above the s h r i e k i n g wind she had shouted i n a cracked v o i c e , t e l l i n g me she would make I t ,
again and a g a i n . She was t r y i n g to convince h e r s e l f .
i a n l n g r u l and comforting but I T a i l e d her. What I s a i d was b a n a l , h o l -
mattered though, she was almost d e l i r i o u s . I t r u l y b e l i e v e d she was
I t r i e d d e s p e r a t e l y to say somethir

It was two days b e f o r e I heard the

o f f i c e I had d e c i d e d to d e s t r o y the l e t t e r , but something e l s e In me always won over. Worst o f a l l , In the l a s t sen-
tence, which had taken an hour to commit to paper, I had asked her to marry me.
S i t t i n g In t h i s c a f e , t h i n k i n g the whole t h i n g over r a t i o n a l l y , I c o n c l u s i v e l y came to the d e c i s i o n that the
l e t t e r had been a mistake. I l i t another c i g a r e t t e , r e g i s t e r i n g b l a n k l y that i t was the l a s t In the packet. Oh yes, a
mistake o f whopping p r o p o r t i o n s . I had been a b u n g l i n g , h y s t e r i c a l , I d i o t , behaving l i k e some pubescent s c h o o l k i d . I
had to make a p h y s i c a l e f f o r t to prevent myself from c r i n g i n g . At best she would laugh at me, at worse... w e l l , I was-
n't even g o i n g to contemplate. Would our r e l a t i o n s h i p ever be the same again? P i g s might f l y , I thought, l o o k i n g up
with a m i r t h l e s s g r i n . Pigs might Tucking f l y .
F o r t y minutes b e f o r e her plane was due to touch down I was at the a r r i v a l s gate, behaving l i k e a man w i t h f e v e r .
I cannot d e s c r i b e the thoughts I was t h i n k i n g .
An e t e r n i t y l a t e r , groups o f b l e a r y - e y e d people began to s p i l l Into the cavernous a i r p o r t h a l l . B r i e f l y I fought
the urge to q u i t e simply run away, and moved forward to t r y and spot Susan. When I saw her, I was s u r p r i s e d that I
f e l t no shock at the c o n d i t i o n she was In. Her face looked l i k e she had been awake non-stop f o r a month. She was p a l e
d e s p i t e a deep tan and w a l k i n g p a i n f u l l y s l o w l y . I f e l t Ilka I was In a u t o p i l o t as I began to walk through the crowd
towards her. I had almost reached her b e f o r e she looked up.
There was a pause w h i l s t her t i r e d eyes looked r i g h t through me. Then, with a b a r e l y a u d i b l e sob, she stepped
Into my arms and b u r l e d her face i n my shoulder. Suddenly I f e l t that we were alone In the u n i v e r s e .
We stood f o r a l o n g time, without words, I t seemed we shared a m i l l i o n unspoken thoughts. F i n a l l y she s t i r r e d and
whispered three words Into my ear.
It took a l o n g time f o r those words to f i n d the designated area of my mind. I stopped r u n n i n g my hand
through the h a i r at the back of her head. They were words u t t e r e d so many times, u n t h i n k i n g l y ,
u n c a r i n g l y , thrown away, always without consequence, u n t i l now. A l o n g time l a t e r I
gathered myself and croaked i n an unsteady v o i c e ,
"I-...I'm s o r r y about the letter...I r e a l l y don't know what- I-..." my speech f a l t e r e d .
What l e t t e r ? She breathed In my ear.
For the f i r s t time I l e t her go and looked Into her eyas, eyas that were so dark
that i t was almost impossible to t e l l were her i r i s e s ended and her p u p i l s began. Then,
s o f t l y , I began to c r y .
Any comments on t h i s s t o r y ?
