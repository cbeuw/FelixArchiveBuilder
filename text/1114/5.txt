research for a forthcoming
documentary about the twi-
light economy surrounding
the world of the sex industry.
As part of this, we would be
interested in hearing from
any students who have
sought to supplement their
income with occasional work
in this area. People with sto-
ries to tell should call David

Obviously, all communication
will be dealt with in the

Editorial
Of all the problems facing IC stu-
dents, a c c o m m o d a t i o n is both
the biggest and the most expen-
sive. L o n d o n - the largest city in
the U K - also has the least proper-
ty available for students. The land-
lords know this, and charge almost
as m u c h rent as 'professional'
h o m e s poor quality properties.
While a student studying in, say,
Sheffield might typically pay £ 3 0 -
£ 4 0 for a r o o m in a terrace house
with a lounge and garden, their
London contemporaries are lucky
to get away with less than £ 7 0 for
a small room in a crumbling flat
with no communal space.
Further more, y o u can walk
around Sheffield in any of the sub-
urbs near the university, and y o u
will see countless signs advertising
vacant student a c c o m m o d a t i o n ,
and even specialist estate agents.
The properties are generally well
looked-after and c o m p a r e
favourably to the 'ordinary' homes
next door. In contrast, student
houses in London bear no resem-
blance to resident's flats and rarely
have all the basic essentials for
habitation - a lounge, a proper
bathroom and kitchen, hot water,
electricity and some sort of garden
or rights to an open space.
Last year, I lived in a fairly typi-
cal student flat in Earl's Court. W e
had no living r o o m , a tiny kitchen
and several bedrooms had been
split up to bring the total to seven.
M y o w n r o o m measured 5 foot by
1 1 foot, and had no windows. A n d
the cost? £ 6 8 per week, now £ 7 3
and rising at £5 each year. I have
heard of and seen m u c h worse
than this.
Given all these problems, why
is it that we also have one of the
w o r s e student a c c o m m o d a t i o n
services in the country? The only
services provided by the S A O to
students seeking private accom-
modation are unhelpful advice, a
copy of Loot and the notorious
property lists featuring landlords at
various stages of hardened crime
and properties which may or may
not have four walls and a roof.
After that, y o u are o n your o w n . So
what should they be doing? The
first and easiest step is to listen to
what students are telling t h e m
about properties and landlords. 1
am aware that the S A O has a poli-
cy of not vetting homes / landlord
(which I strongly disagree with),
but the very least they can do is
ban from the lists those names
with the worst reputation, such as
Mrs Sofiar.
Secondly, they can and should
check properties and contracts
before students sign and move in.
The S A O has a massive potential
influence over landlords' behav-
iour. While landlords don't care a
jot about individual tenants, if they
know that they will not get any IC
students until they act legally, they
will soon c o m e up to scratch
Lastly, the College should con-
sider the shining example set by
Hull University (yes, really). They
have a policy of signing longer term
tenancies on suitable properties
and then sub-letting them to stu-
dents. This allows them to keep the
prices d o w n , the landlords in
check, and the students well
looked-after. Do y o u think the S A O
would ever d o that? W o u l d a land-
lord ever let y o u off the rent?
