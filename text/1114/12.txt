m There's a comfortably large
body of singles for you to
digest this week. So sit back,
relax, read and enjoy...
A
fter the success of Brimful
OfAsha the world's ears are
waiting for an equally uplift-
ing follow-up. Of course, this is a
Cornershop song rather than a
Norman Cook remix so it is rather
different but the enticing melody
and thought-provoking lyrics that
make up Sleep On The Left Side
never fail to draw you in.
Stuck Mojo produce a pre-
dictable mix of heavy metal thrash
and Chilli Pepper pseudo-rap. At
least Rising has great lyrics. "Liar
liar, pants on fire" is the only bit I
could understand.
The Only One starts with s o m e
nice guitar strumming, then has
some traditional Irish music, then
goes all Natalie Imbruglia sub-indie
angst. That's about it from
junkster, really. Ed
S
mash Mouth's The Fonz has
a big dirty o p e n i n g but
descends into a fairly average
song that just plods along without
really taking y o u anywhere. There's
only really the musical stop before
the chorus that's going to keep you
listening. M i n d y o u , y o u c o u l d
always listen to the live version of
Walkin' on the Sun. Track 3, if y o u
were wondering.
Boom Boom Mancini release
Arguments and Alcohol, which is a
fantastic title, isn't it? I think every-
one can claim his or her's fair share.
Sexy female vocals, happy bassline
and a chorus that most people will
find themselves either singing along
to or reproducing on the phone
c o m e Saturday morning: "I didn't
really mean it. I'd like to try again."
Continuing the fantastic titles
theme, Snow Patrol's 100 Things
you Should Have Done In Bed is
obviously a take on all these maga-
zines, such as F H M and M a x i m ,
that have articles like 50 Ways to
do it When You're 50! Jumpy in a
lo-fi garage sort-of way. Worth lis-
tening to for a while.
"I a m a square peg in a star-
shaped hole" M a y b e Clitterbox are
trying to say they're not cut out for
fame with latest release, Houdini.
I'd propose that they're wrong. A
refreshing and cooling mint to take
away the stench of meat and pota-
to guitar rock. Gorgeous and
anthemic. N o w they've been heard,
let's hope they don't do a disap-
pearing act.
Sunhouse's Animal appears to
be a surprise. The peaceful acoustic
mumblings of the verses c o m e to
serve as no sort of portent for the
frighteningly fuzzy chorus. "Aaargh!
1 still feel like an animal!" W o a h !
Calm d o w n , mate. Their last single
being a broody blues track, it seems
that they've tapped into something
a bit more primal and this is to their
credit.
There's a driving bassline here
that chugs relentlessly and gives Six
by Seven's Candlelight a kind of
perpetual motion. Propelling for-
ward with no apparent ending,
you're sucked into its paranoia. You
Ballroom
Don't Stop
Beautifully majestic. Imagine
Embrace's A l l Y o u G o o d G o o d
People without the arrogance,
without the sneers, without the
hype chopping away at its heels.
Awash with strings by the end,
Don't Stop is an awakening that
takes y o u onto its magic carpet
and flies y o u away from all the
crap. Effortlessly uplifting.
Dennis
appear to be greeted with a light at
the end of the tunnel, only to
realise it's another bloody train!
Thoroughly engaging.
Christ, talk about formulaic!
Verse, Chorus, M i d d l e Eight,
Chorus, Solo. Despite the apparent
conformity, Alison's Room still
transmits a raw intensity and you
can't help but get excited about the
pounding rhythm and catchiness of
the song. As 60 Ft. Dolls' singer-
guitarist Richard Parfitt declared: "If
Oasis are the Beatles doing Abbey
Road, we're the Beatles in
Hamburg!" Dennis
B
abybird's Bad Old Man is a
deliciously melancholic p o p
tune. Dark lyrics combine
with a slow, twisting piano melody
to produce a brilliant single.
Komputer's Valentina, on the
other hand, is basically Kraftwerk
gone horribly wrong. Awful lyrics,
awful tune, awful single! Nuff said.
Slow gospel funk melody and drea-
ry lyrics supply a far below average
single from Monkey Mafia. Long
As I Can See The Light is not what
has c o m e to be expected of Jon
Carter. Unfinished M o n k e y busi-
ness, me thinks.
Caught between indie and p o p ,
The Jellys are still unsigned and no
wonder! The more heavily guitar
driven tracks on the Head
first... Legs last...EP are quite
catchy, though.
The First Things First EP pro-
vides drug addled lyrics of y o u n g
love, prisons and the hard life.
Beautifully sung by Lee Griffiths,
the male equivalent of Tracy
Chapman, with exquisitely under-
stated acoustic instrumentation.
Spearmint appear to be a mix
between Dodgy and Gene. The B-
sides on A Trip Into Space EP are
more measured acoustic affairs but
the title track is certainly a
pop/dance/indie monster that
could be a summer hit.
New Rising's Drowning Reason
is a reasonable listen. Distant male
vocals filter through the haze of
indie guitars and various effects. A
good sounding track reminiscent of
the more mediocre Stone Roses
tracks. Ramzi
B
lack Box Recorder's Child
Psychology sees Auters
scary-man Luke Haines back
with a tense and bitter-sweet track
featuring the life story of a prob-
lem-child. Exquisitely performed, it
is slow, melodic and tragic but
sadly rather vacuous. Like Fitter
Happier, it doesn't stand up to
repeated listening.
Idlewild A Film for the Future.
Idlewild are inevitably going to be
compared to their Edinburgh con-
temporaries Urusei Yatsura, so 1
may as well be first. Their high-
energy fuzzy guitars and super-
charged punky lyrics are indeed
E S S * H O O N
similar, but Idlewild are faster,
darker and heavier. A Film for the
Future is an arse-kicking romp of a
track that demands the volume to
be cranked right up high. Their first
single with the Food label, this is a
cracking effort - Idlewild are going
to be G O O D .
Marcy Playground Sex and
Candy. You must have heard this on
the radio - the one that goes
"Hanging r o u n d , d o w n t o w n by
myself/ A n d there she was/ Like
double cherry pie". A fun, singable
ditty from their eponymous new
album, this is an enjoyable but ulti-
mately harmless number ideal for...
well, for day-time radio playlists.
Lower Crime Satillite
Formulaic indie-rock, this rather
sterilised, undynamic song pro-
vides little interest. The B-side, /
Am Remote Control is better, a
slower track performed with feeling
that shows initial promise, but sadly
descends into cliched and unimagi-
native guitar solo.
Space Monkeys Sugar Cane is a
Sugar-frosted not-quite rap not-
quite-reggae mess. The Space
M o n k e y s like to be cool and sing
about drugs, but they lack the
h u m o u r of Cypress Hill or the
power of PWEI. B-side Pin Up Boy
is an attempt at a vocal-led ballad
which, frankly, fails. Naff. Jeremy
i O N
a c c o m p a n y the acid-smooth
vocals of Andy Yorke (yes, brother
of the man himself) before burst-
ing into a bold, clean but angst-
ridden chorus. The song follows a
simple template, but is no worse
off for that. The single also
includes three more fine tracks not
on the album. W h e n Unbelievable
Truth reach the 'third album cre-
ative stage', they are going to be
something special. But don't take
my word for it, listen for yourself at
