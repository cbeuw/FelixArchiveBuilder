8 May 1998 COLUMNS
By the time this hits the news-
stands, a large number of y o u will
have voted in the local elections
and the mayoral r e f e r e n d u m .
Despite the fact that 1 know that
you hang o n m y every w o r d , there
is little point in trying to influence
you after the event. The elections,
however, coincide with Labour's
first anniversary, a n d since the
world a n d his wife are expressing
an opinion, I would hate to be left
out.
1 must admit that the first year
of N e w Labour has not been as
disastrous as previous Labour
administrations. Economic chaos
has not ensued, though elements
of their budgets, such as the wind-
fall tax, have proved less than
desirable. Bank of England inde-
pendence is something that the
Conservatives should have imple-
mented years ago, a n d is to be
congratulated. M a n y of the
Education initiatives are also to be
congratulated, though o n e has a
sense of deja-vu with m u c h of
David Blunkett's policy. The moves
towards peace in Northern Ireland,
building o n the foundations laid by
John Major, are excellent, if fraught
with difficulty. However, all is not
quite so rosy, if you'll forgive the
pun. W e have a government of
unprecedented arrogance c o m -
m a n d e d by a m a n w h o has delu-
sions of presidency. The spindoc-
tor has been raised to messianic
status, with the creeping politicisa-
tion of the Civil Service. N e w
Labour spoke at length of Christian
family values in their manifesto,
which has sown the seeds of the
patronising, infu-
riating puritanism
that is so wonder-
fully exemplified
by the beef o n the
bone b a n . W e
have a govern-
ment that w a s
elected partly o n
an anti-sleaze
ticket, w h i c h
accepted £1 mil-
lion from Bernie
Ecclestone and, in
a totally u n c o n n e c t e d action,
exempted Formula O n e from a
tobacco advertising ban. W e have
Labour M P s facing criminal
charges for election fraud, both in
Scotland a n d England. Such is
Tony Blair's obsession with p o p u -
larity that he has backed away
from or watered d o w n much of the
very g o o d welfare reform pro-
posed by Frank Field, a man told to
'think the unthinkable', now limit-
ed to thinking whatever Alistair
Campbell tells him. W e are repre-
sented o n the international stage
by a loutish Foreign Secretary, w h o
despite so much promise in o p p o -
sition has shown that the only
department briefs he has mas-
tered are those belonging to his
secretary. The calibre of some of
the Cabinet is s o low, as in the

] with innumer-
able other inci-
dents, gives cr-e-
C l " dence to the
idea that, for all the affability of
Blair, this is a government that is
becoming ever more aloof a n d
self-obsessed.
While we're on the subject of
elections, something rather worry-
ing occurred to m e earlier this
week. A s many of y o u will know,
it's all change for the way Imperial
is g o v e r n e d . O u t g o e s the
Governing Body to be replaced by
a Court a n d Council. ICU will get
m o r e representation o n
the enlarged Court, with
places for the President
and six others. These will principal-
ly consist of the C C U Presidents
and a Deputy President or two to
make the numbers u p . This is
where alarms bells started ringing.
What w e are proposing is that the
interests of 1C students are to be
represented by the Presidents of
RCSU, C 8 . G etc. A m I alone in
being somewhat unnerved by this
prospect? The C&.G President
hardly acquitted himself well this
year, and the prospect of my inter-
ests being p r o t e c t e d by the
President of the RCSU fills m e with
horror. I cannot think of people at
Imperial less well equipped than
this lot to defend our interests,
elected o n a negligible mandate by
cliques of self-promoting hacks.
Aside from the ICU President, w e
should adopt the m e t h o d of elec-
tion used for the administrative
representatives, namely a ballot of
those to be represented. That way,
we would hopefully achieve broad-
er representation, outside the nar-
row sectional interests of the
Union hacks. The potential for
damage caused by the proposed
setup is enormous. A n y candi-
dates?
