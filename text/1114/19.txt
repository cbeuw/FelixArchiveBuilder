SCREAM 2
Starring: Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox,
Director: W e s Craven
David Arquette
T
his is how sequels should be
made - the same winning for-
mula that made the first film
such a success, a d a m n fine plot,
which develops the character out-
lines presented in the first film, plus
an amazing degree of self referenc-
ing. In fact, so strongly are s o m e of
the jokes, and indeed the plot
itself, reliant o n Scream, that I
would suggest anyone w h o hasn't
yet seen the first film d o so before
watching Scream 2.
Neve Campbell returns to star
once again, and although she's
now moved to College her past
continues to follow her. O n the
opening night of Stab, a film about
the murders in Scream written by
Courteney Cox's amoral reporter
Gale Weathers, the masked mur-
derer strikes. A n d so the cycle
begins again...
Obviously, the best thing about
Scream was the way the film man-
aged to send-up the entire horror
genre, whilst still being a horror
flick. In this, Scream 2 is even more
successful. Early on in the film,
geeky film student Randy (one of
four characters to survive from the
original) lists the central tenets of a
horror sequel. It must be more gory
than the first film; the death
scences must be more elaborate;
the body-count must be higher.
Brilliantly, writer Kevin Williamson
then includes all these elements
over the course of the next ninety
minutes, whilst still managing to
send up the entire concept of the
sequel. This culminates in a final
scene which utterly breaks the final
rule - never ever kill off the bad-guy
for sure (otherwise, how can y o u
make part three). A n d , I promise,
you'll never guess w h o d i d it.
The one d o w n side is W e s
Craven's directing. Although bril-
liantly controlling the tension in the
"horror" scenes, he simply isn't any
g o o d at " n o r m a l " f i l m - m a k i n g .
Blasting over-the-top soundtrack
music (which he's lifted from
Broken Arrow, where it was cheesy
enough to start with) simply isn't
necessary.
Fortunately, however, any
errors on W e s Craven's part are
more than adequately made up for
via Kevin W i l l i a m s o n ' s script.
Turning an ironic eye over the
genre, the film, the plot and even
the principal actors previous
careers (the Friends references are
great), without for one moment
slipping into farce, he still manag-
ing to keep y o u on the edge of your
seat for the full two hours. You sim-
ply won't believe that this is the
man also responsible for the the
travesty that was / Know What You
Did Last Summer. 1*1

The answers to last week's
poser was: Kevin Williamson wrote
last years / know what you did last
summer, the sequel to which will
be appearing later this year. H e
definitely didn't write Halloween.

I
f y o u want to see a really g o o d
film, then I'd definitely recom-
m e n d that y o u avoid
"Something to Believe in" like the
plague. Believe in life, believe in
love, believe in yourself, believe in
miracles (so the film's blurb tells
us), believe that this is really bad.
If you're still interested after
that intro. the plot is as follows.
Maggie (Pitillo), a blackjack dealer
in Las Vegas, discovers she has a
fatal affliction and has a few weeks
to live. So, she decides to set off
to Italy to be healed by a statue of
the M a d o n n a . O n the way she
meets M i k e (McNamara), a strug-
gling pianist going to a competi-
tion, and they fall in love. But is
their love d o o m e d because she is
dying? Can the statue save her, or
is it just a fake? - you'll just have to
wait to see the sickeningly pre-
dictable conclusion of the film.
At one point I thought the film
might be trying to take the piss out
of itself, but it was just too shit.
The acting was bad; the plot bor-
ing; the script lifeless. There's a
nice bit of piano playing though.D
