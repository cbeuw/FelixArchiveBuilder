Letters to Felix... Trouble A h e a d for
Campus Renaissance
LEAN, MEAN A N D
TURNING GREEN
Dear Editor,
1 thought I might offer further
insight into the rector's c o m m e n t :
"My students are no smarter than
those at Oxford or Cambridge,
they're meaner and leaner"
Sir Ronald Oxbrough.
Meaner because they have to
deal with nightmarish a c c o m m o d a -
tion officers [Letters, Felix 1 106 &.
1109] and landlords [House of Hell
- Felix 1113].
Leaner because they eat f o o d
served up by IC catering.
O n a second note, perhaps w e
should all get a glimpse of the
Sherfield extravagance mentioned
by Simon. It would be a great fun
for Sherfield's suite 5 to be o p e n e d
up for visitors (a bit like the Lord
chancellor's apartments) w e could
then all stand in awe of the decor
and excellent equipment (so I've
heard); mega-pentiums (used to
run the exceedingly processor- and
memory- intensive programs such
as M S Excel, W o r d etc.), portable
laptops, Psion organisers etc. and
then return to our cold, pokey,
dim-lit, asbestos-ceiling (in Huxley
anyway) offices to d o m o r e
research, that gets awarded grants
that makes Sherfield g o round.
Regards,
M a d h u Bhabuta, PG
HOUSE OF HELL
PART II
Dear Felix
I have been meaning to write
this letter for some time and letter
'House of hell1
in this weeks issue
(1113) at last p r o m p t e d me to d o
so. The reason is that I too have
suffered at the hands of the landla-
dy mentioned in that letter as, I a m
sure, have many other I.C students
and I a m glad that this issue has
been brought to peoples attention.
This, however, is not the main
reason for me writing. I feel, as
clearly does m y collegue from flat
2, 42 Queen's gate gardens, that
serious questions have to be asked
of the accomadation office and the
service (or lack of it) that they pro-
vide for I.C students.
After having lived for a year in
sub-standard, over priced accoma-
dation at the adress mentioned
above (as advertised by the I.C
accomadation office) my current
flatmates and 1 returned to the
accomadation office in search of
something better. W e had been
looking for weeks for something
suitable but had found nothing and
the end of term was now upon us.
In desperation we went to the
accomadation office for some help
and advice and what did we get?....
A copy of 'Loot'.
This second example of total
indifference to the student led me
to wonder what the people in the
accomadation office actually d o all
day (apart from not be able to work
out that a flat containing two dou-
ble rooms and one single room is
not a flat for three people).
Accomadation offices at many
other universities offer all sorts of
help and services to their cus-
tomers (yes w e are customers
since, without us they would not
have a job) including landlord vet-
ting, a c c o m a d a t i o n inspections
and contract checking. I a m not
suggesting that they check the flat
or house of every student before
they move in but the least you
might expect is that the properties
and landlords that they advertise
be looked at. Under their system it
seems that any old tax dodger with
s o m e flats that he can't let out to
the general public because they are
in such bad condition can simply
phone them up and ask them to
add it too their lists (apologies to
any legitimate landlords reading
this).
It is well known that finding
g o o d accomadation in London is a
nightmare so we must d e m a n d
better help and advice. The service
that I have experienced from this
college department is appaling and
clearly a waste of our money. The
answer is simple: either get the
people in charge to buck their
ideas up or close the place down
once the halls have been filled each
year and put the money into some-
thing useful (education perhaps?)
As for all of the other Sherfield
departments, well there's not room
to m o a n about you here. Some
other time maybe?
Cheers

Nightmare landlord or house? Let
us know, the name / address and
what problems they have caused
you, and we will produce a 'name

SOUND ADVICE
Dear Felix
Thanks for reporting the may-
oral elections last issue [news,
1113]. While I think that a mayor
for London is a g o o d idea, 1 would
like to tell readers on thing - w h e n
we d o get to vote on w h o it will be,
D O N ' T vote for Jeffery Archer.
This man is a con-artist and a
liar. Through out his career he has
contstantly c l a i m e d to have a
degree f r o m O x f o r d university
(which he hasn't), a diploma in
anatomy from a prestigious
American college (which he hasn't)
and that he holds qualifications
from the International Federation
of Physical Culture (which doesn't
exist).
W h e n voted on to the Greater
L o n d o n Council in 1967, he
claimed to be the youngest coun-
cillor ever (which he wasn't), and
immediately started a scheme to
fiddle collegue's expenses. While
on the G L C , he also joined and
extorted expenses from the United
Nations A s s o c i a t i o n . H e then
attempted to sue newspapers car-
rying this story in order to improve
his image enough to get elected as
a tory M P , giving up the suit a few
years later. O n c e again, he claimed
to be the youngest member of par-
liament (which he wasn't, by five
years).
Archer's dodgy share dealings
with both Aquablast and Anglia TV
are well k n o w n . Less c o m m o n
knowledge is a blatant shoplifting
offence - he stole three suits values
at $ 5 4 0 from an American depart-
ment store.
This man cannot be trusted
with a baby's rattle, let alone the
capital city of England. D O N ' T
VOTE FOR H I M .
