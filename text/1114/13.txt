Freedom @ Bagleys Film Studios
11pm- 7am £12 on the door £8 members
I
t's been about four years since I
last ventured too the back
streets of Kings Cross to Bagleys
studios - probably the best venue
on the larger side of things in t o w n ,
from what I can remember. But this
time I was rolling VIP style and not
only was it the start of the 4 Liberty
European tour (Dreem T e e m -
Mikee B, Sponny 8. Timmi M a g i c
and Colour Girl and Luigi perform-
ing live) but the Freestylers (inter-
view issue 1 106) were also in the
house launching the all new break-
beat room. Nice touch.
Right - s o m e facts about
Freedom - it's on every Saturday
and has to be the biggest weekly
event in L o n d o n . S o m e 2,500
party people can fit in - the closest
thing you'll get to a large-scale rave
in town. Boasting four rooms of
music, one playing Hardish H o u s e
and the other has DJ Aerial playing
his mind-bending 10-hour set each
week - he plays what he plays like.
Then in the two smaller rooms y o u
get underground Garage (Dreem
T e e m etc) and the all new
Breakbeat r o o m (Freestylers) that
one of the promoters that I was
chatting to seemed very excited
about. O n e of the best things about
this club is that even though it's
often quite packed and people are
constantly m o v i n g from one r o o m
to another is that there is no stand-
ing in queues trying to get here and
there y o u simply step outside walk
d o w n the side of the buildings to
the r o o m y o u want then go straight
in no hassle. With this large outside
area y o u can step out and cool off
and get away from the hectic pace
of the interior of the club and chill
for a bit. There is also a nice spread
through-out the rooms, plenty of
bars and bar staff, drinks at stan-
dard club prices and they have even
got friendly ' n ' helpful security.
W h e n 1 finally found my way to
the entrance a small road off Yorke
Way, Kings Cross right behind the
station that is surprisingly un-sign
posted, all hell seemed to be brak-
ing lose. People crazyin' out all over
the place and a V W camper van
with people jumping about inside
it, a film crew filming it and some
geezer with a flame thrower sort of
fing burning up the front screen.
M o s t peculiar and I hadn't even got
in yet. You'll probably see big
queues but don't let this put you off
as they get people in very quickly
indeed, unless you happen to be on
the guest list then you can expect
too spend some time watching the
paying customers queue disap-
pearing at a phenomenal rate whilst
yours has only m o v e d two feet. But
y o u can't have your cake and eat or
something!
O n c e inside the massive place
you can take your pick from the
host of musical styles on show, in
the Garage r o o m M i k e e B absolute-
ly rinsed the place out dropping
some phat slabs of underground
t w o step business f o l l o w e d by
Colour Girl performing her latest
release Tears (reviewed s o m e
weeks back) and the crowd appre-
ciated this girls vocal talents. 100%
live - no back dates here and you
would not been able to tell the dif-
ference between the live perfor-
m a n c e a n d the record superb
voice. In the all new breakbeat
room the Freestylers rocked the
place with there unique blend of
nu-skool breaks ' n ' beats to not the
biggest c r o w d but a up for it one
that appreciated the music.
I seriously advise y o u too check
this place out, it's a unique venue
which you're very unlikely to find
anything the host of top DJs and a
friendly c r o w d anywhere else.

Don't forget y o u can catch the
D r e e m T e e m a n d the whole 4
Liberty crew at their end-of-tour
party @ Twice A s Nice, Londons
leading Sunday affair on 31 M a y . A
night not to be missed.

GARAGE
Decoder & Mark Caro. Eko
(Tech Itch) 25 May
Tech Itch is one of m y favourite
labels on the dark side, and they
are maintaining their run of strong
releases with this collaboration
between two outstanding produc-
ers in there o w n right. This has
been ripping up clubs of the likes of
Metalheadz for a little while now,
dark melodic hooks 8^ fx run along-
side skippy beats and a dark sub
bass. Flipside hard 'n' intelligent, a
12" y o u ' d be silly to miss.
Solar Nine. Download
(Splash Records) 18 May
This is a rough tune with big phat
beats that just roll along, echoing
beats &. spacey fx give it depth and
tight percussion keep it m o v i n g for-
ward. A guaranteed c r o w d pleaser.
Flipside harder not so rolling more
broken beats, spooky fx and dark b-
line and that's just the intro. Badd
tune.
just too dark - absolutely tearing.
This is such a tune that even thou it
was released last week, 1 still heard
it played d o w n Metalheadz on last
Friday - the home of up front D & B .
Not just one of the best tunes of
the year but of all time.
Peshay. Miles From Home
(MoWax) Out Now
I don't know what's going on this
week - must be an important date
on the calendar or something. Two
of the best tunes of past years have
been released over the last few
weeks. Again a tune your know as
soon as it's double bass line drops
in and that sample from M u s i c
Box-Full Cycle. This has been float-
ing around on dub plate for about
one and a half years by my reckon-
ing - so long in fact that 1 though it
had already been released and I'd
missed it.
IP
Trace. Sonar
(Prototype) Out Now
This is a tune your know as soon as
you hear the first few echoing keys
and the smooth break beat. Then
when it drops after the break it's
P). Too Young (FatBoy Rec.)
This is the vinyl debut from PJ a 12
year old boy from Northampton. In
that smooth groove sort of style
bouncy beats stabs of this 'n' that
clever arrangements, tough but dif-
ferent sub-bass and soulful male
vocal stabs complete the package
nicely. But 1 fail to see h o w a 12
year old kid could have made this,
I feel it has more to d o with Kostas
P (Kilo Kings) &. James Reynolds
(London Connection) the engi-
neers. Sounds a bit like a PR stunt
to me. But still a g o o d tune.
Chris Mack. Get It (Confetti)
Chris M a c k has had a few g o o d
tracks out lately and perhaps this
has gone to his head a bit and he
forgot to finish this track before
getting it pressed up. N o seriously,
this is so nearly a wicked track, but
as I say it sounds unfinished a
strange off beat / broken beat style
that seems to be missing some
beats or something. Trying to hard
to be different.
Curtis & Moore. Never Give Up
(Swing City) 8.5.98
Four mixes on this one, vocal,
accapella 8. a couple of dub mixes
to chose from, Bumpin' Dub is the
one that's d o i n g it for me, cuts
d o w n the lengthy vocal, strips away
the annoying piano and altogether
toughens up the beats with a step-
ping sub bass line to match. In that
new style that's c o m i n g on strong
using stabs of keys it has a light
uplifting feel, needs to be heard a
few times before you appreciate
just how g o o d this track is.
Gruesome Twosome. Track/More
(Checkmate Masters)
This a superb piece of vinyl con-
taining two tracks with two mixes
of each. The first tune is Track the
first mix is a slow 2-step sort of
style with old skool over tones but
done in a different way to most. A
great tune to start your set with
nice intro and clever beats in the
chorus that sounds like a 2-step
meets hip-hop, love it.
2nd mix is in a harder style and
it's just as g o o d just a different
flavour. Flipside More again is in a
hard Garage style and just as g o o d
as the other side a excellent collec-
tion of tracks.
