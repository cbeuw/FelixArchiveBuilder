UG Employment in 1998
The Centre has a number of vacancies for
undergraduates to work in the Centre this summer.
There are two main projects. One is to assist in
Year 2000 compliance testing of P C s across all the
College campuses, the other is to help with setting
up the P C systems in the B M S building as it is
occupied this summer.
A reasonable knowledge of P C hardware and
systems is needed, with knowledge of Windows NT
an advantage. Training in the Year 2000
compliance testing will be given.
Payment is in the range £120 to £150 per week. No
student will be allowed to work more than 10 weeks.
Please send your applications by e-mail to:
m.duane@ic.ac.uk
You should give your department, year and course
of study. Also the name of your personal tutor.
Interviews will be arranged early in the summer
term.
