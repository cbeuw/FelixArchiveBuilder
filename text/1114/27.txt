IC Smash
Twickenham Sevens
In traditional preparation t o a 7s
tournament, the majority o f the
squad were doing their best t o
stock u p o n the necessary liquid
that w a s essential for any rugby
competition. W e arrived o n time at
H a m p t o n Court, only t o realise that
Twickenham RFC w a s in H a m p t o n
1 10 miles away!!!
Our initial w a r m u p in the Royal
Oak did not show promise in the
first couple o f games, making a
slow transition from I 5s t o 7s.
Despite losing our captain a n d
squad pretty " U G L Y " boy, d u e t o
bust ankle and broken nose respec-
tively, w e did our best t o keep the
opposition out of the try scoring
zone. Close contests with L o n d o n
Nigerians a n d O l d Actonians s a w
us qualify into t h e B o w l
competition.
The first knock o u t g a m e
against Twickenham s a w us start-
ing to play sevens with a length of
the pitch try from Matt "chicken"
Dixon. Quick reaction a n d skilful
passing combined with a n awe-
s o m e side step allowed Charlie
"I've g o t a sore knob / give m e a
pint" Cunnell t o score under the
posts, to seal a convincing victory.
The next Imperial game was the
M e d i c s against Baling.
Unfortunately, overconfidence and
key errors made by play maker
Simon "miss in front of the posts /
did that g o 10? / are w e playing
touch?" Rogers saw the departure
of the M e d i c s a n d meant that
Imperial would have t o fight hard
to come away with s o m e silver
ware.
In t h e semi-finals against
London Exiles 2 IC showed their
qualities by playing "champagne
rugby". Chris "lightweight"
Dickinson, initiated and finished off
a well w o r k e d try which easily
foiled the defence, resulting in a
seven pointer that any team would
be proud of. A quick pick u p a n d
lightning acceleration from Telfa
"you smell" Beynon confirmed our
place in the final against London
Exiles 1.
The game started well by "slight
of frame" scoring within 5 seconds,
and Telfa the cheetah sold more
d u m m i e s than M o t h e r Care t o
score a superb individual try. The
Exiles fought back, but the match
was guaranteed courtesy o f Davo
"I forgot to pass" Gol in fine style,
to win the 1998 Boddington Bowl.
Thanks must g o t o Twickenham
RFC, M a l c o l m a n d Pete Joyce for
liquid rewards, Joe "Lloyd?" for her
post match massages, a n d all
those w h o turned u p t o make it a
great and enjoyable day.
