E
a
c
h t
e
a
m plays first round g
a
m
e
s against the other three
t
e
a
m
s in their group. T
h
e top t
w
o t
e
a
m
s in each group then
qualify to m
o
v
e into the knockout rounds, w
h
e
r
e the compli-
cated seeding process should see g
a
m
e
s get increasingly
tough.
For instance, if England win their group then they will play
the runners-up in Group H - m
o
s
t likely Croatia. I
f they w
o
n
that game, they'd play the winners of g
a
m
e 5 in the Quarter-
Finals. Unfortunately, that'd probably b
e Germany. Sadly,
our track records against t
h
e
m hasn't b
e
e
n all that g
o
o
d in
recent years (bloody Waddle).
However, if the G
e
r
m
a
n
s d
o collapse, faced b
y the sur-
prise of meeting England o
n
e round earlier than usual, or if
w
e can finally find s
o
m
e
o
n
e capable of scoring penalties,

England m
o
v
e into the semi's...where the seeding suggests
Brazil to b
e the opposition. If, miracle of miracles, w
e beat
them, which admittedly is highly unlikely (unless Scotland d
o
u
s a favour a
n
d hospitalise Ronaldo in the first game), then
only o
n
e m
a
t
c
h remains, with Italy or Argentina favourites to
m
a
k
e the final from their half of the draw.
So, who's going to win then? Well, in the w
o
r
d
s of Alan
Hanson, "football's a g
a
m
e of percentages", and with 90% of
the footballing skill, talent and flair belonging to Brazil, in the
s
h
a
p
e of Romario, Juninho, R
o
b
e
r
t
o Carlos a
n
d of course
Ronaldo. You'd b
e a fool to bet against them.
