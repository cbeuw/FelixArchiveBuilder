his mini album / EP, whatever
you want to call it, features
three remixes of the best
tracks from the Juice back cata-
logue: Hard Disk remixed by Zinc,
Babylon, Daz remix and Oh Cosh
Swift remix. In the triple vinyl pack,
you get these alongside three total-
ly new tracks. If you prefer C D s , not
only d o y o u get the six previously
mentioned tracks but also another
six tracks taken from the back cat-
alogue all c h o s e n a n d m i x e d
together by the d o n DJ Randall.
Hard Disk Zinc remix is a full o n
tearing amen affair as y o u might
expect from Zinc. Slaughter by
Undercover Agent is a dark menac-
ing roller with spacey sounds and
FX bringing y o u right back up to
date. Babylon Daz remix is a clever
reworking bringing this massive
track into '98, but I'm not so sure
Q. What is Roger Sanchez's nick
name ?
1. Roger Rabbit
2. The S-Man
3. Sanchez Panchez.
T
his next competition is for all
of y o u w h o like their dance
music hard and upfront as
you get the chance to win not one,
but four C D s from Harmless
records purveyors of quality c o m p i -
lation sets.
O n e lucky winner will be walk-
ing off with Colin Dale's Mutant
Disco, Loftgroovers' Speedcore
(nothing to d o with speed garage),
N o r m a n Jay's The Sound of
Philadelphia vol.1, and DJ Pogo's
The Breaks (UK D M C scratch mix
champion).
A most impressive collection of
CDs and all you have to d o to win is
answer the following question;
Q. Colin Dale has a weekly
* * * * 1/2
about that barking d o g sound!
Walk Tall by Embee is a
absolutely killer track that's been
doing plenty of damage in the
clubs. W h e n it drops y o u ' d better
hold on tight or you'll be washed
away by the phat hard stepping
beats, wicked time-stretched beats
that keep building . Oh Cosh the
Swift remix is probably my favourite
track from the Juice back-catalogue
and I've been waiting to hear how
y o u ' d remix such a classic track.
Swift does well in keeping with the
original rolling flavour and adds a
dark bass line and busting beats. It
still sounds a little o d d though.
Finally Retry by Magistrate is much
more in the style of the recent 12"
releases: very futuristic sounding
bubbling sub-bass, metallic beats
FX with stabs of snares firing in now
and then.
This EP isn't a collection of cut-
ting edge upfront tracks, I'm sad to
say but more a overall picture of
the labels past, present and future
showing h o w their sound has pro-
gressed and developed over the
years. Highlighting the pivotal
m o m e n t s in the labels lifetime
gives a g o o d indication of their
overall sound.

hey say all g o o d things c o m e
in threes. Calling all budding
designers: here's your
chance to s h o w off your design
skills by creating a new logo for
Phuture Trax. I'm sure most of y o u
don't even k n o w w h o or what
Phuture Trax are. Well, let me
explain, they are probably the
biggest and some would say the
best PR company and record label
all under one roof, supplying peo-
ple like me with records, C D s etc to
review and play out. Did I mention
this is on a worldwide scale, so the
winner will have their logo o n all
their merchandise all over the
world. But y o u also win a huge
package of all the CDs, records and
16B. Sounds From Another Room
(Eye Q) • • • •
This, again, is an album that defies
categorisation c o m i n g from the
highly impressive 16B. This album
twists and turns, with nearly every
track changing style and sound.
From funky down-beat tracks to
soulful deep house and everything
in between, this album has ali your
heart could desire. From 16B y o u ' d
expect nothing but the finest,
smoothest production techniques,
which, as ever, you get. M e l o d y
Maker called this an early contender
for album of the year, but, although
this is a g o o d album, I feel you have
to be into the more downbeat side
of things to really appreciate it. A
very pleasant and refreshing collec-
tion of beats that should d o very
well.
Dub Funk Association.
Confrontation in Dub. -k-k-k-k
This is an album of remixes of tracks
taken from the last three albums
released by Dub Funk Association,
bringing together Reggae, Jazz,
Techno and House, combined with
plenty of funk. For this album, they
have asked various producers to
remix any track from the three pre-
vious albums in any style.
What you end up with is 16 tracks
ranging from the blunted Hip-Hop
joints of Part 2, Jah Rasta Dub work-
ings from Shotgun Rockers, and a
trancey house number from Spiral
Head, alongside smooth Drum and
Bass tracks by Fellowship and
Emdee (Splash Juice records),
8 May 1998
tapes they can lay their hands on,
so y o u ' d better bring a truck.
Ideally they would like the logo
shown below elaborated on, m o d -
ernised and expanded on.
For more info call Jodie at
Phuture Trax on 0171 357 004. Or
send entries to Phuture Trax, Unit
312, The Leather Market, Weston
Street, L o n d o n , SE1 3ER and don't
forget, y o u can enter as many times
as y o u wish, so get designing.

some old skool electro from Cabal
and even uplifting d e e p H o u s e
tracks, so there's something for
everyone. You may think all these
different styles wouldn't sit c o m -
fortably together but y o u ' d be mis-
taken. In some strange way, they all
fit together nicely, with the elec-
tronic (computer synthesised) feel
being the c o m m o n denominator.
This is one of the more adventurous
albums around at the moment.
Global Underground - John Dig-
weed in Sydney
A double C D from John Digweed, a
DJ w h o from humble beginnings,
has made his name as one of the
leading House DJs on the world
stage, mainly by avoiding all the
hype and bullshit and by letting his
tune selection and mixing ability do
the talking. Unlike most House CDs
you've seen this year, you won't be
able to find any chart toppers here.
This is the second House C D I've
heard this year that is a cheese free
zone with only the choicest cuts of
deep, trancey and experimental
house being used.
As y o u ' d expect, the mixing is as
seamless and progressive as always
with Digweed keeping it real. M a n y
of the tracks will be unfamiliar even
to the trainspotters out there, as
there are plenty of unreleased
tracks and dub plate pressure on
these C D s . Tracks from Danny
Tenaglia, Albion, Mortal, Deepsky,
Paul Van Dyk and many more gives
this mix a truly global feel. The first
must have House C D of '98. JP
