THE ESCAPADES OF BOANERGES IN THE LONDON -
BRIGHT OK RALLY . I 0VEM3ER 15 t h .
The weather f o r e c a s t on the Saturday evening was not v e r y
p r o m i s i n g , c o l d w i t h s c a t t e r e d showers. I t was o n l y t o be hoped
t h a t the showers would not s c a t t e r themselves .on. the London-
B r i g h t o n r o a d . I t meant an e a r l y s t a r t f o r a l l concerned and the
v e r y s l e e p y crew of "Boanerges" r o l l e d , up at the C o l l e g e at
7.15 a.m.
In the greyness of the morning "Bo" c e r t a i n l y l o o k e d r a t h e r
d i s p a s s i o n a t e but a f t e r the a d d i t i o n of a few g a l l o n s of the
e s s e n t i a l s the o l d boy seemed a l i t t l e more p e r k y . A t l a s t
a f t e r innumerable adjustments had been made t o the too numerous
c o n t r o l s Bo a r r i v e d i n f i n e time at the "Magazine" i n Hyde Park,
where the n o i s e and smoke seemed t o grow i n volume as d i d the
s p i r i t s of the crews of "Bo and the t e n d e r " .

h e " G u i l d s " v e t e r a n was s u p e r i o r i n t h a t i t a r r i v e d under
i t s own power; f o r most of the v e t e r a n s had. been c a r r i e d - not
j u s t towed - on q u i t e massive c o n s t r u c t i o n s w h i c h d e v o t e d l y f o l l o w e d
t h e i r charges. In the Park i t was d i s c o v e r e d t h a t "Bo" had not
enough water t o l a s t the j o u r n e y ; so what c o u l d be b e t t e r t h a n t o
f i l l the spare cans from the S e r p e n t i n e . The v e t e r a n s were s t a r t e d
i n order of age at i n t e r v a l s of t h i r t y seconds. "Bo" was number
48 and was soon o f f t o a f i n e s t a r t , w i t h the tender f o l l o w i n g
w a t c h f u l l y .
i'hrcaigh London went the p r o c e s s i o n ; past most of the noble
b u i l d i n g s and. almost a l l London was t a k e n i n g a l l a n t s t r i d e ;
B r i x t o n H i l l caused a l i t t l e t r o u b l e f o r some v e t e r a n s but not
so f o r the mighty "Boanerges" - at l e a s t not a f t e r he r e a l i s e d
he would have t o go up, so he stopped banging and smoking and
went up i n t r i u m p h , but when he had c o l l e c t e d h i s cheers he
f l a g g e d and had t o be r e v i v e d by some S e r p e n t i n e w a t e r .
Perhaps i t was i m a g i n a t i o n but "Bo" seemed t o have more
v o c a l supoort throughout the journey than the r e s t of the e n t r a n t s
put t o g e t h e r . "Boanerges" had one m i s f o r t u n e , but q u i t e a minor
one. The nut came o f f one of the c h a i n j o i n i n g l i n k s , but i t
gave the crew time to stamp t h e i r f e e t , and. someone e x p e r i e n c e
i n the use of a hammer.
I t seems t h a t the " G u i l d s " i s not very w i l l i n g f o r a t r u c e
w i t h the "Gentlemen" I n b l u e , f o r they f l a u n t e d an a c q u i r e d
t a x i - h o r n at e v e r y aforementioned "Gentleman" they encountered
as w e l l as g o i n g a l i t t l e too c l o s e f o r c o m f o r t . T h i s was perhaps
u n f o r t u n a t e as the P o l i c e on t h a t Sunday were r e a l l y c o - o p e r a t i v e ,
a l l o w i n g s t a g g e r i n g v e t e r a n s t o r a t t l e a c r o s s a g a i n s t the l i g h t s .
I t was t r u e t h a t manners were not l a c k i n g i n the crew of "Boanerges"
however, f o r a l l g e s t u r e s whether from o n - l o o k e r s or P o l i c e were
acknowledged i f o n l y by the t a x i - h o r n . A f t e r a w h i l e i t was
r e a l i s e d , t h a t "Bo" was s p e e d i n g , t h i s b e i n g p r o h i b i t e d by t h e
r u l e s of the R.A.C. f o r t h i s run and at one p o i n t "Bo" was a c t u a l l y
to be seen d o i n g 40 rn.p.h. ( a l t h o u g h I t was d o w n h i l l ) .
"Bo" e v e n t u a l l y a r r i v e d i n Maderia D r i v e w i t h much c h e e r i n g
and waving w h i l s t steam i s s u e d from the v a r i o u s pipes of other
v e t e r a n s .
a f t e r lunch "Bo" was moved t o the p a v i l i o n where the Mayor's
tea was t o be h e l d . I t was here t h a t f u r t h e r p r e p a r a t i o n s were
c a r r i e d out f o r the r e t u r n j o u r n e y . T h i s t e a was the h i g h spot
of the day and perhaps i t was not s t r i c t l y t r u e t o s ay t h a t a l l
"Bo's" crew and f o l l o w e r s were i n v i t e d , but a l l attended i n the
t r u e I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e f a s h i o n .
D u r i n g the t e a ~ i t was l e a r n t t h a t "Bo" had been d i s q u a l i f i e d
f o r indulerina i n e x c e s s i v e speed. The day was drawing i n t o evening
and the r e t u r n journey had t o be f a c e d , i'his was q u i t e u n e v e n t f u l
except t h a t "Bo" was v e r y r e l u c t a n t t o f o r e g o f u r t h e r r e f r e s h m e n t s ,
as were the crew.
The t a x i - h o r n was u s e d t o f u l l advantage w h i l s t the crowds
i n " P i c c a d i l l y " were g i v e n a. f i n e e x h i b i t i o n of c i r c u l a r m o t o r i n g
w i t h Mr. C a r r u t h e r s i n the c h a i r . F i n a l l y the c o m m i s s i o n a i r e at
the D o r c h e s t e r was a l l o w e d t o use h i s v o i c e i n order t o s t o p 'Bo"
e n t e r i n g , so "Bo" r e l u c t a n t l y r e t u r n e d t o c o l l e g e , d e c i d e d l y hot
under the bonnet.
