Asit ChandmaJ was born in
India in June 1939. The first
two years were the most frust-

it the age of two, tiring of
gurgling as a means of com-
munication, he changed to Eng-
lish, and despite forays into
Gujarat!, Marathi, Hindi, Ger-
man, French and Sanskrit, has
stuck to English ever since.
At the age of four, he joined
a girls' school and spent three
congenial years there, but alas,
('for no apparent reason') at
the age of seven was asked to
leave. The shock of joining a
boys' school so upset him that
for the next seven years, he
studied hard. In his spare time
he won a few table tennis
tournaments (his doubles part-
ner is now ranked the best
player in India), switched to
tennis, then to squash, and at

reasonably—to have a hand In shaping it; and this
requires acquaintance with what may lie ahead. But
traditional methods of probing the future are no longer
In favour. Crystal-gazing has obvious limitations.
Witches are prophets only of ultimate doom. So today
one turns, in the first instance, to the appointments
officer for the pathways to the future. We, for
our part, would like to elaborate what lies along
one of them—Unilever Research.

Research in Unilever means Industrial research:
research directed to specific ends: research with a
practical outcome. But not only that. No industrial
project or problem stands In Isolation. Its roots rarely
lie In industry. So, research In Unilever also means
research In a number of contrasting fields—detergents,
edible fats, foods, cosmetics—and it means, further,
research In surface chemistry, glyceride chemistry,
protein chemistry, and a host of equally fundamental
topics. It means a community of scientific Interest within
Unilever, and continuity of academic contact outside it.
It can mean research as a career, or as an Introduction
to the technical and commercial sides of Unilever.
It can provide satisfaction in the pursuit of it and
financial reward in the success of it. There Is only one
minor hazard. Our standards of acceptance are high.

the age of sixteen, rediscovered
girls. H e met a girl in Bombay
University, courted her over
three continents and nine
countries until after seven
years, she could resit him no
longer and finally said yes.
Not being satisfied with th*
degree in Mathematics that he
was awarded in Bombay, Asit
came to Imperial College sev-
eral years ago, and has been
trying to do Mechanical Eng-
ineering ever since. H e has
spoken in a number of debates,
and was elected President of the
Debating Society, has also
written for the college literarv
publication P H O E N I X (Two
stories, an article, and a piece
to be published this week).
During the summer vacations
he hitch-hiked in Europe and
attended student conferences
in Vienna, Berlin (East imd
West), Stuttgart, Paris and
London. On three distinct oc-
casions, he has graced the small
screen (!), once appearing with
a group of Asian students, once
while playing cricket in East
Berlin, . . . and the third time
when IC students questioned
Mr. Grimmond on the Liberal
Party Programme towards the
end of last session. H i s crack
about the Liberal Party (com-
pared with the Tories and Lab-
our, the Liberals seem like u
penny ha'penny trying to Le
twopence') was quoted in three
national newspapers. With
his talent for a witty and bal-
anced speech, Asit had no dif-
ficulty in leading the G u i l l s
team to victory in the Inter-
collegiate Competition, and his
speeches at Guilds Union
meetings resulted in him being
christened 'the notorious epig-
ram king'.
A hard and enterprising or-
ganiser, despite his literary
trends, Asit almost doubled the
sales of F E L I X when he took
over as Editor in the usually
slack summer term of last ses-
sion, and by boosting advert-
ising, managed to make F E L I X
break even, (it had been losing
up to £20 per issue). H i s
campaign for President was
similarly thorough—seventeen
council members seconded him
and there were no other can-
didates.
Asit has played squash and
table tennis for IC and as re-
sidents of Beit H a l l know, is a
talented photographer.
The Union is in a state oi
change, with South Side com
ing up and old buildings being
demolished. It wil be tough
year and the President will
need a lot of co-operation (and
constructive criticism) from
everyone, especially Council,
and his beautiful wife-Mina.

Like most Clubs in Imperial
College Union, the Socialist
Society is open to all, even
Conservatives and Communists.
We cannot promise you a
pancea for the ills of the world,
but we do offer a forum .co
which your particular solution
can be put. To all those who for
one reason or another call them-
selves socialists, and to those
who think that they might be,
and to those who want their
fears of us confirmed, as well
as to the curious, we extend
a welcome.
Our basic business is discus-
sion, though.this does not rule
out action. Through the Nat-
ional Association of Student
Organisations, those with a yen
for the cut and thrust of party
politics can operate, and our
programme includes theatre
visits and once around the
Houses of Parliament guided by
M.P.s of Great Repute.
We meet every week, the
time and place being posted
around the College in advance,
and if you didn't meet
us at the Freshers' Re-
ception then contact Paul
Carter through the Union Let-
ter rack in the main lounge; he
is our secretary. Freshers tea
is a highly informal gathering
with no ponderous speeches of
welcome, though everyone is,
The time-honoured custom is to
discover exactly in what way
everyone else is wrong.

hope yet, for by the American

you think that the above is evan
vaguely funny, you are just t h °
