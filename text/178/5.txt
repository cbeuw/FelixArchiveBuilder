Are you a literary genius,
a brilliant and observant
reporter, a veritable news-
hound with a talent for un-
earthing that hidden story?
Well, probably not, but
don't let this deter you.
If you can write legible and
understable English, or if
you are just reasonable cap-
able with a paste brush,
F E L I X needs you.
Several fascinating posts
with great prospects are
still vacant. Young lndiee
with typing ability are also
urgently required.
For further information
please get in touch with the
Editor via the Union Rack,
or at the F E L I X stand on
Freshers' Day.
