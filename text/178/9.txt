FELIX
CAN YOU BEAT THAT?
Imperial College has always had a fine sporting record i n the
University, and usually managed to win a tew of the session's
laurels, but the 1961-1962 session was a bumper year to say the
very least. Intercollegiate sport among the three constituent
Colleges is usually taken as an excuse for impromptu rags as for
instance on Morphy Day or on the occasion of the 10 Swimming
Gala (which last session resulted in a bumper crop of arrests)
but when it comes to U L Championships, the attitude is some-
what more serious, and as was seen last session, can be
blessed with startling success.
The first big 10 success, and
perhaps the greatest single
achievement, was in the Hyde
Park Eoad Belay race, held on
'18th February. TJhis race, a
yearly event organised by the
College, was last won by I C in
1949, and with names like Herb
Elliot and T i m Briault in the
running, an I C victory seemed
hardly likely. Strong running
by the whole team, and a -fan-
tastic last lap by John Cleator,
however, gave I C an unex-
pected victory and a new re-
cord time.
A fortnight later, the Cross
Country Club followed up with
a win and a new course record
in the Culham Bond Belay, and
the first and second teams won
f$iie championships of D i v . I
and D i v . II of the University
League.
Dennis Harburn and the Soc-
cer first X I also had a good
season, winning the U L Soccer
Cup for the fourth year in suc-
cession, a feat equalled only by
L S E thirty years ago. As
Harburn put it:, 'the only re-
cord in the competition; we do
noi} already hold.' (they also
won the League championship).
Not to be outdone, the I C X V
beat the Boyal Vets, to retain
the Gutteridge Cup, while the
Sailing Club, not only won the
' A ' and ' B ' Points but finally
Left to Eight:
University Jazz Cup
Gutteridt "e Cup
Culham Cup
Dixon Bowl (in background)
U L Soccer Cup
Hyde Park Eoad Belay Cup
Castaways' Cup
managed to win the coveted
and elusive Castaways Cup for
the first time.
As if all this was not enough,
IC also won the U L Basketball
League Championship and
knockout competition, the U n i .
versity Jazz Cup and the Boat
Club brought home more bacon
in the shape of the Dixon Bowl.
That was last year—a con-
vincing tale of superiority in
the field of University sport.
What happens this year depends
to a large extent on the sup-
port and enthusiasm of the
freshmen.
How about it IC? Can y o i
beat that?

The members of the club are
often regarded with suspecting
looks when one hears that they
run, yes E U N 5 miles or
more. Well how about 12
miles, including a climb and
descent of 4,400 ft., all in 2
hours! This is just what Chris
Evans managed, followed by
George Turner and Chris James
(Capt.) to put IC in third
i place in the Ben Nevis race.
Barrow A . C. were first and
i Lochaber, the locals, second
with I C close behind, out o)f
i the thirty teams entered. The
only other university or college
i team was St. Bart's Hospital
who were placed 10th despite
i an excellent run by the U L
Captain, Pete Littlewood who
I came 12th.

Chris Woodcock of Kings also
• ran under I C colours just for
the hell of it and, despite no
) training, managed to complete
the course within the standard
I time of 3J hrs. The team had
prior to the race spent 3 weeks
' en holiday in Scotland doing
some walking and climbing.
' It is interesting to note that
fc last year the race stumped some
of the College's best runners,
I whereas this year's team are
all second team runners.

MORHY DAY 1962
R E M E M B E R R E M E M B E R M O R P H Y D A Y 1962 ! 1!
Perhaps it Is rather early to publish a reminder about Morphy'
Day, but in view of the very successful Morphy Day festivities)
of 1961, no effort should be spared to ensure that this year we
should have an even better turn-out.
For the uninitiated, Morphy
Day is College Boat Eace Day.
when the crews of the three
constituent Colleges battle it
out on the Thames at Putney.
Last year, E C S won the
coveted Morphy Cup leaving,
the Lowry Cup to Guilds, and
this year, no doubt, all t h u e
constituent Colleges are hoplrjg
to do even . better.
The actual Boat race, how-
ever, tends to be purely incid-
ental, the masses of supporters
lining the towpath tending to
be too concerned with flour-
bojmibs, -eggs, rotten tomatoes
and the opposing college's mas-
cot to take much notice of
what is going on on the river.
Last year a six foot diameter
rubber punch bag added great-
ly to the proceedings, sererai
gentlemen braving the waters
of the Thames in order to re-
trive it when it went out of
play. It is about the only of-
ficial Eag Day in the College
calendar and should not h
<
s
missed,' It is advisable, how-
ever, to turn up in rather older
clothes, with preferably a
spare pair of trousers, as these
have been known to get lost on
these occasions.
Morphy Day usually takes^
place early in November, the
final Order of Battle being de-
cided at meetings of the con-
stituent 1
College Unions a short
time before the actual day.
Those whom have qualms
about missing lectures should
tafre solace i n the fact that
Morphy Day is a half holi-
day.
