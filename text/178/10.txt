-10 FELIX
F u l l m a r k s
to me!
M o n e y matters are m u c h less troublesome now. N o w that I bank w i t h the
Westminster. W h e n I receive a cheque or a warrant, I don't hunt' round any
more for someone to cash it: I pay i t straight into my bank. I use cheques myself, for payments;
and bankers' orders —not my memory—take care of the
regular items, such as subscriptions. I gave myself full marks for 'discovering'
the Westminster. A n d so, I think, would you. Just ask the nearest
branch (address i n Telephone Directory) to tell
you about the Westminster B a n k service to students.
