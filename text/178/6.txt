- 6 FELIX
by Colcutt
Who is tiiis bloke Chand-
thal? Where if he? When is
lie coming back? Is he coming
oack? A t the time of writing,
only flie answer to the first
question is known with any
certainty. Asit Chand'mal is
of coursa the President of the
Union. H e went home to In-
dia at the end of July to get
married and very little has been
heard from him sincew Well
founded rumour has it that he
has not, after all, taken a wife,
due to difficulties in obtaining
an export permit for her, but
as 'o his whereabouts and E T A
—no one seems to know. Mnv-
be he has performed the celeb,
rated Indian Rope Trick, in
which case we will have to elect
Otto Schmink to office after
all.
Another question preying cn
the minds of many thinking
men around the Union is
"where is everyone going to eat
when term starts?" The de-
molition of Ayrton H a l l seven
months before the opening of
the new refectory facilities .n
Prince's Gardens has severely
reduced Mooney's Chip Bar
service. The increased num-
ber of students in College this
year will aggravate the problem
and utter chaos is envisaged
during lunchbreak for the first
few weeks of term. The Col.
lege Authorities, clearly wor-
ried by the situation, showed
great presence of mind in cal-
ling an International Congress
of Food Science and Technology
to find some means of feeding
3.000 plus students using
only one kitchen. Four-
teen hundred delegates came
fverm all over the world to
IC in September and found
out for themselves that it
was quite impossible to get
ouick meals in our refectories.
Tn liason with the College Re-
fectory Committee, the "Sea-
food P l a n " was drawn up, Ihe
details of which are given else-
where. It has leaked out that
the Southend branch of the
National Federation of Winkle
Stall Proprietors hns been iri-
vited to transfer their stalls to
Prince Consort Road for the
'off season'. Another part of
the Plan concerns Departmental
Snack bars, and perhaps there
will be sales girls vendir
'snack packs' in the aisles of
lecture theatres between 11.00
a.m. and 3.00 p.m. The Do-
mestic Bursar has said that the
matter is well in hand; Col-
cutt's advice, however, is that
the readers of this column, hav-
ing been forewarned, should
partake of large breakfasts until
February.
A l l old lags returning to Har-
lington this term will find a few
changes. The pavilion is be-
ing extended to provide four-
teen new changing rooms and
much improved toilet facilities.
The unsightly concrete huts
and greenhouses are being re-
moved and a hot-plate is being
installed m the buffet-bar to
ensure a plentiful supply of the
ever popular hot pies. Work is
about to begin over the road to
provide six new winter games
pitches which, together with the
pavillion extension, will ad-
equately cope with the expected
increase in sporting activities of
the expanding College. Thy
new changing rooms were to
have been built during the sum.
mer vacation, but the work was
held up due to 'unforseen cir-
cumstances' and as a result
they will not be available for
the first few weeks of term.
The completed scheme will
make 'Loveday Mansions' one
of the finest sports grounds in
London, but what a pity that
the extensions could not have
been completed in time for the
rush at the beginning of term.
Another rumour!! For ad-
ministrative reasons, the Geo-
logy Department (RCS) is con-
sidering a move to the Roval
School of Mines. This would
mean a switch in Union alleg-
iance and the loss to the R C S
Union of the Geology Depart-
ment. Student reaction to such
a move is not yet known, but
it is certain that it would be a
sad day for R C S U if it lost its
smallest yet liveliest (union-
wise) department,—and heaven
knows, the R C S Union is pretty
short of life these days.
I hear that U L U have once
again sent us 3,000 Union
Cards to be written on, signed,
catalogued, and distributed to
every member o IC. This
would be a considerable amount
of work for our already over-
worked secretary. The sole pur-
pose of these cards is for pre-
sentation at the rare checks
held at the U L U door when
there is a suspicion that a non
member is going to snieak in
to watch the telly on a cold
night. H o w ridiculous—an
I C U membership card used to
be sufficient proof of member-
ship before, so why compcilate
the issue now? I understand
that the secretary is considering
sending 30,000 ' i C U cards to
U L U for distribution among
all the members to enable them
to come and watch nr televis-
ion. At present, the system is
that any University student is
welcome in our Union, provid-
ing that, he/she proceeds in a
manner benefitting a gentleman
lady etc. etc.

John Preece
Hon. Secretary of the Union
J, B . was born and bred in
Cheshire at a place with the
dubious name of Clatterbridge,
and studied at Calday Grange
Grammar School at West
Kirby. Unfortunately, this in-
volved a daily journey of many
miles, and led John to the
•shameful habit ]of getting un
with the birds every day. This
sad habit has lapsed consider-
ably over the last four years
bub is apparently about to be
reinstated.
In 1958, John came to the
Mechanical Department, and is
now engaged on research in the
CJhemjical Engineering Depart-
ment. A sportsman by nature,
he plays soccer for the illus-
trious First X I and manages
some cricket during the sum-
mer, though he prefers to -plav
for the Sunday X I where the

At the time when Colcutt
was composing his column, no
news had .been received of Pre-
sident Chandmal. Much to
everyone's joy anr relief, the
great man finally appeared on
the scene on the afternoon of
the 20th September, with a long
reluctance of the Indian
Government to allow him
to leave the country. Even
after allowing him to return to
England, they still had .the last
word—his bride of three weeks
was not allowed to accompany
him.
game is not so serious. H i s
name has been associated with
a recent Preident of I C W A at
times, but concrete evidence is
slow in materialising.
A couple of years ago, when
making his own beer on a hop
picking farm, he managed to
get himself mixed up with a
big machine, and as a result,
became very adept at wielding
a single knitting needle. It can
be sajid that his arm is now
more valuable than the rest of
him put together.
John considers the Union to
be the main mechanism by
whjichi the College turns out
people of value rather than slide-
rule pushers, and hopes that,
with the controvertially mined
President, they may be able tq
create more interest i n and life
around Union actjwities.
A P O L O G Y
F E L I X would like to apologise
to R C S President, Mike Harris
for omitting the last paragraph
from the report of the R O S U
Annual General Meeting pub-
lished in the last issue of last
term, which read: "The meet-
ing was finally closed by a rous-
ing Kangella inside the Guilas
front entrance, the party then
