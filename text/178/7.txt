All work and no play
makes Jack a Bachelor (of Science)
by Pete Alison (Bachelor 23rd year)
This article is vrritten not only for those who are already
engage! or married but also for the 'unattached' who prefer an
evening of female company when they could be drinking, playing,
poker or working.
The social events provided for
your pleasure during the year
cover an extensive range, so
(hat everyone should find one
function at least to their taste.
After the Freshers Hop on Fri-
day, to which all the old hands
always go, there is an infor-
mal dance, or hop. on every
Saturday in term time. These
are organised and run by Hie
various College clubs and soc-
ieties, thus providing a certain
amount of variety in the choice
of bands, decorations etc. The-
number of tickets sold is lim-
ited, and split to ensure equal
numbers of ladies and gentle-
men, thus providing, it is
hoped, a satisfactory evening
for all. As the hops are popul-
ar and the tickets limited, de-
mand usually outstrips supply,
so that ICmen are advised to
purchase their tickets on the
Thursday or Friday lunchtime
proceeding the dance.
The first formal event of the
session is the Commemoration
Ball, on Thursday 25th October
which this year is being held
at Claridges. The ball is held
primarily far those who have
just left College and who are
presented with their various
'Associateships' on the after-
noon of the 25th of October in
the Albert Hall, but many pre-
sent students usually take ad-
vantage of this opportunity to
spend an unforgettable evening
in the second-to.none atmos-
phere of one of London's top
hotels.
The next event this term is
the November 5th dance which
is held at the C
o
l
l
e
g
e sports
ground at Harlington. Trans
port is provided both ways and
a pleasant, informal evening is
ensured with dancing, a gigan-
tic bonfire, a fireworks display,
all free of Police interference.
Following the Harlington
Hop, there follows the comp-
letely informal Guilds-Mines
Carnival, on Friday November
23rd. This provides an excel-
lent opportunity to let your
hair down, everyone more oi
less wearing fancy dress occas-
ionally connected with the
theme of the Carnival. Dan-
cing is from 9.30 p.m. to the
early hours; there is a buffet
a rousing cabaret, and finally
for the tired, a film show.
Several bars in variqus parts
of the, Union building are open
till 2 a.m.
To complete the first term,
the Mines Ball is held on the
last evening. This is organised
mainly for the members of the
Eoyal School of Mines, but
other members of the College
have been known to obain tic-
kets. This is usually a small
(about 150 couples) but friend-
ly formal evening which is en-
joyed by all.
A similarly full programme
is planned for the Spring and
Summer terms, with the R C S
Carnival, the Engineers' Dinner
Dance, the I C W A Formal and
the R C S Country House Bali.
The year's formal occasions are
finally brought to a close with
the College M a y Ball, in the
last term.
A l l the carnival, balls, hops
and dances are organised by the
students and are excellent value
for money; the list is so long
and varied that there should be
something to everyone's taste,
so that we look forward to see-
ing you there.
