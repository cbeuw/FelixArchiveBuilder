C.&G. MOTOR CLUB
FELIX
The Motor Club eaters for the motoring interests of Guilds"
men, and Indeed a oordial Invitation to membership is extended!
to all Imperial College people. This long established Club last!
year had a record membership of about ISO—one of the biggest
in I. C.
The pride of the Club with-
out doubt is our 5 seater phae'-
on, a 1902 James and Browne.
He (please note the gender)
rejoices in the affectionate nick,
name "Boanerges", possibly
so-called from the two massive
pots wherein his power is de-
veloped. " B o " enters for the
Brighton run each year invar,
iably getting there, and this is
one of the outstanding events
of the College social calendar.
In one recent run he developed
anti-social boiling habits anu
had to be assisted up hill by a
band of willing Guildsmen. H i s
consumption of water was equ-
alled only by that of ale by the
Guildsmen on arrival at Bright-
on 1
The Club holds fortnightly
meetings at which there are
film shows or guest speakers,
and it has been known for those
who indulge to re'.ire to the bar
afterwards. If, however, lad-
ies accompany us ( and honest-
ly we love 'em to come along)
we imbibe in the Union lounge,
because you will be aware of
the mystical rites which ensue
if woman sets foot in the bar.
Getting back to motoring, re-
cent speakers have included
Raymond Mays, and Brown
(the Vincent flier), and last
year works visits were organ-
ised to Jaguars and Aston
Martins' (which leaves the H o n .
Sec. in a bit of a quandary as
to where we can visit this
year).
Bob Beaumont, the Rally
Secretary, will be organisiug
one or two even's for the com-
petition minded, and he will be
able to arrange entries to the
rallies of certain o'.her London
clubs.
It remains now to remind
you that the first meeting will
be held on Friday, October 12th,
at 5.15 p.m. in room 542 i n
E . l . block (Mechanical Engin-
eering Department in City and
Guilds College). Two films in
colour will be shown, " B . R . M .
1959" and '.'Highway Holiday".
Everybodv is welcome, wheth-
er a member or not, so do come
along with your friends.
