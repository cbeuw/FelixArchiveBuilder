SOUP KITCHENS FOR l.C.?
There have been rumours that
some form of soup kitchens will
have to-be instituted at IC in
view ,of the fact that Ayrton
Hall, long on the list of pro-
perty to be demolished, has
finally succumbed to the cruel
hammers, pickaxes, battering
rams and other fiendish imp-
ements of the demolishion con-
tractors.
Joking apart, the College has
always suffered from inadequate
catering facilities, and with the
closing down of the biggest re-
fectory, the situation will no
doubt get worse. The new Col-
lege buildings on the south side
of Prince's Gardens will not be
completed till the new year, so
that until then, a certain am-
ount of disorganisation is to be
expected. However, it should
be possible to avoid the usual
long queues in the Union if it
is remembered that lunches are
available in several places in
the College.
Lunches will be run on two
lines:
Hot, three courses lunches,
and:
Snack lunches with hot tea,
coffee, sandwiches and if pos-
sible, hot soup, sausages and
pies.

the facilities available, together

AN
OPEN
INVITATION
The idea that having an account with a nation-wide bank like the
Midland is something reserved for people of substantial means is a
fallacy. So also is the belief that banks are interested only in those
who are older and already established. The Midland Bank is inter-
ested in Y O U — and all young people like you. You would find a
bank account extremely useful for, besides the convenience of pay-
ing bills by cheque, you will find that it helps you to keep track of
your expenditure.
