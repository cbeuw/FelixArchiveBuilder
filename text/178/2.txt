Editorial
First and foremost, a big welcome to all/our Freshers both
undergraduate and postgraduate. Like a form of blood trans-
fusion, )fche Freshers give that extra pep and vigour to the the
College, and enable it to continue unchanged, yet re-energised
year after year. . No doubt, enough has been said about that
happy balance between work and play, both by the representatives
of the academic side and the Union side of the College, so that
there is no need to add more, except to underline that the word
balance implies a bit of both.
Those who are coming back to College for their second or
third year will no doubt notice a slight change in Felix. The
format is slightly different, there being four columns to a page
instead of three, this giving more scope i n the layouts and more
flexibility in sizes of photographs etc. The printer has also in-
vested in a second Linotype machine, so that in the next issue
we will have the choice of the two type faces, namely Latin 10
point or Times 11 point. It is to be hoped that these changes
will result in an even better F E L I X , which already i n its pre-
. vious form was a source of envy and inspiration for some of the
other London colleges.
Other changes in the College scene involve the sudden dis-
appearance of old buildings and the appearance of new ones.
Perhaps the change which affects most people, is the shutting
down and demolition of Ayrton H a l l . This means that One ot
the largest College refectories has disappeared and as a service
to students a F E L I X survey has been carried out to discover how
the College is going to cope with the new catering problems. The
results of this survey are published elsewhere in this issue
Last but by no means least, a few words about F E L I X staff.
There are several positions still to be filled, so that anyone who
•is at all interested in F E L I X should apply as soo nas possible
is at all interested in F E L I X should apply as soon as possible to
the Editor. Sports reporters, a production manager to help the
urgently. The Editor can be contacted through the Union Rack
or directly (Room 83, New Hostel).
W R I T E F O R F E L I X
Articles for F E L I X are always welcomed by the Editor,
especially when they are on current student or College topto,
They should be sent In via the Union Rack addressed to the
E d i t o r — F E L I X , or handed to the Editor direct. (The Union Rack
is the letter rack in the lounge on the ground floor of the Union
building.)
A l l 'copy' should be double spaced, written on one side of
the paper only and typewritten If possible. Authors, who may
nvrvain anonymous if thev so wish, should remember that If
necessary, their artic'es will suffer editing and possibly, cutting
subject to the discretion of the Editor.
If you feel strongly on that Yital topic, don't just mutter
to yourself—it gives a bad Impression ("Its the DTs again").
It is far better to spread yourself In print, and prove to all and
sundry that you are more than a pretty face.

Continued from tront page,
and visited the drawing offices
and the structures, concrete and
hydraulics laboratories.
On his way from the Civil
Building to the Hepvy Elec.
Eng. laboratory the Duke had
to pass ' B o ' which had been
strategically placed on his route.
Harry Watson and Sammy
Klatt extolled the virtues and
idiosyncracies of B o ' , and
B o ' no doubt feeling the im-
portance of the occasion started
with the first swing of the
handle. The Duke, though very
interested in B o ' refused an in-
vitation to drive it.
Leaving, B o ' ticking over
sweetly, the Duke went into
the Heavy Elec. E n g . laborat-
ory where several research pro-
jects were demonstrated and
then down into the boiler house
to see the three giant oil fur-
naces which will eventually
supply all the College's heat.
The party then went into the
Mechanical Engineering build-
ing to visit the steam laborat-
ory and the fatigue laboratory
where further demonstrations
wee given.
Before leaving for refresh-
ments the Duke was introduced
to Mrs. Arnold, Head Cleaner
of City and Guilds who has
been with the College for 53
years without a break.
The Duke with the Rector.
