A Welcome to Freshmen
from the President
Instead of the usual 'rhub-
arb about apathy (of which,
rest assured, you will hear a
great deal eventually), I want
to give you some information.
A number of old building were
pulled down this summer,
among them Ayrton H a l l where
there was a big refectory. I n
order to compensate for this
loss, many temporary refect-
ories have been set up over the
Island Site, in addition to the
refectory facilities in the Union
building whjch will be funct-
ioning as usual. Please make
sure that you know where
meals are available, otherwise
conditions might become chaot-
ic. There will be plenty of no-
tices about the place.
The second point concerns
U L U cards. A l l members of
Imperial College are automat-
ically members of University of
London Union,, but a special
U L U card is necessary for ad-
mission to the U L U buildings
in Malet Street. These will be
available on request at the I C
Union office.
Thirdly, I would urge you to
buy and read F E L I X every
fortnight. It is the only way of
knowing what is going around
IC and you will soon get the
flavour pf IC life through the
pages of F E L I X . . Tor those
who are interested, F E L I X
needs reporters and sales staff.
Experience is unnecessary, just
get in touch with the Editor and
offer your services. A healthy
press reflects a healthy Union
(which can be taken in more
ways than one).
As for the rest, you will have
heard it all at the talks given
by the senior student officers on
Freshers' Day, and have more
than enough information to
make a start. This is my sec-
ond 'letter' to you, as I will
have addressed you by the time
you read this. It is only com-
mon courtesy to reply to let-
ters, so write to me, or come
round and see me, even if it
is only to say hallo.
Good luck and good-bye till
then.

After furtrer presentation the

comment by Sir Roger Makins
that this was the last time the
old entrance to City and Guilds
would be used in an official oc-
casion, the Duke observed thaD
this was the first time he had
been called upon to preside
over a destruction. The Rect-
or expressed the thanks of the
College to H i s Royal Highness

trical Engineering block, where

ories and a lecture theatre.

leted Civil Engineering block,
