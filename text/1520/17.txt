COMMENT
FELIX Imperial outside the M25
Francisca Sconce
“The Summer Ball you asked for.”
This central statement has been behind
the build-up for this year’s Summer Ball,
and yet enthusiasm for the formal din-
ner has not been the instant sure fire hit
that feedback from last year’s event and
format has led us to believe. So why is it
that when presented with the opportunity
to congregate amidst a sea of tuxedos
and ball gowns over a three course meal
at Imperial, there are many opting out of
ending the year over dinner at Imperial? Or
even more pressingly, why aren’t students
accepting what the Union has changed for
them specifically?
This year’s formal dinner is due to be
held in the Senior Common Room at a cost
of £40, while entertainment tickets cost
£35 to see the likes of Ms Dynamite and
electro swing outfits perform.
Though the change to a festival format
in 2011 was the result of a decline in the
sale of formal dinner tickets year-on-year,
this year’s formal dinner tickets mark a de-
crease in cost. Whereas in 2010 a formal
dinner ticket would set one back by £85
(rising to £90), this year saw joint tickets
rise from £70 to £75.
Following last year’s change in format
from its prior formal beginnings, a com-
mon concern was that the Summer Ball,
above all, “should be about having a spe-
cial evening with our friends” as summa-
rized by one individual. One commenter
from our Summer Ball survey last year re-
marked that “to celebrate the end of our
time at Imperial, we don’t really want big-
name bands.”
Groups of students have suggested hold-
ing their version of a formal dinner else-
where, whether privately at home or at a
restaurant, though with some openly ad-
mitting that the price of their own events
“could match that of the formal dinner
itself”, there must be further reasoning
behind why the formal dinner is not an
instant-buy prospect. A range of reasons
could immediately be raised, from the pric-
ing, however reduced, to the location.
Feedback was the reasoning behind
ensuring that the festival format was re-
moved for this year. The Union have openly
changed the format, yet the formal dinner
has reverted to pre-2011 enthusiasm.
While some consider the Summer Ball to
be “an integral part of the university ex-
perience”, as the deadline approaches
for the formal dinner tickets, we will see
whether Imperial will recall its past desire
for a formal dinner, and whether students
will buy into a format that they actively had
a part in organising.
The Summer Ball you
asked for
Don’t worry, they’ve put a new facade on Mech Eng so it now looks as good as this...
It’s just College
doesn’t seem to
have any strategy
regarding
planning and
investing in
future Silwood
staff and
students

F
ollowing last week’s Felix
story about Silwood Park, I
felt it was important to write
about what it’s actually like
here at Silwood, which,
uniquely for a London based univer-
sity, is outside of London. Having been
a student here and South Kensington I
have found that they are very different.
With 160 students, 60 academic staff,
and over 100 hectares of parkland,
there’s lots more space than at a London
campus. I am writing this outside in the
sun, surrounded by flowering rhodo-
dendrons, and in the distance there is a
lab group having their meeting by our
lily pond, it is really beautiful. In 2009,
Campus Dean Mick Crawley said to Re-
porter that it is “such a luxury to be able
to do my fieldwork within a few yards
of the laboratory”. We also have a small
friendly community, where you can ac-
tually get to know almost everyone’s
name, both staff and student.
There are, however, some downsides
to being here; sadly I don’t believe that
the campus’s uniqueness makes up for
the lack of investment in our social
and recreational facilities. We do have
a shiny new teaching building, but our
halls are only just adequate. We have a
dingy squash court, weedy tennis court,
and a tiny gym, which to be honest feels
like you are exercising in a nuclear bun-
ker. The refectory, bar and social room
buildings were built for temporary use
about 60 years ago; they’ve done well
to still be standing but frequently leak
and are freezing in winter. Added to
that, they are not big enough to hold all
of our students at once.
Why don’t we come up to the Union
and go to GSA events at South Kens-
ington? It can be a four hour round trip
by train, and the last one leaving Water-
loo is fairly early compared with when
an average night out finishes; as we all
know, train and tube fares are not cheap.
We do have our Union minibus at Sil-
wood, but we give priority to supermar-
ket trips (the nearest is a 30 minute walk
away), and activities, which inevitably
clash with events. Recently we’ve bor-
rowed a second minibus, which has
been great, but we’re not sure if we’ll
still have it next year.
Another issue here is welfare. In a
small community people form close
bonds and it can be very supportive.
On the other hand it can be fairly gos-
sipy, news gets around between staff
and students, so if you want some time
out it’s not easy. I’ve had quite a few
people asking me this year whom they
can talk to about issues affecting their
work and mental health. In most cases
I’ve directed them to someone who can
help, but the fact that they ask, shows
me that the relevant services just don’t
seem available.
Things have not been helped by the
resignation of several staff members
and hearing that more are considering
their positions. Regarding the Applied
Ecology courses discontinuing due to
staff leaving, as I said I am sad that
these courses are going, though it is
encouraging that they will continue at
another institution. They have been at
Silwood Park in some form for over 50
years, whilst the remaining ones started
within the last eight: we are passing a
milestone here in Silwood history.
Overall, I feel there has been a bit of
a negative atmosphere across campus.
Don’t get me wrong, we do have some
fun here, from our annual music festival
Silfest to our comedy ‘homage’ to the
staff at the Silwood Revue, we can be
imaginative in entertaining ourselves
over the year. It’s just College doesn’t
seem to have any strategy regarding
planning and investing in future Sil-
wood staff and students. Why hasn’t
this been complained about more? I
think because staff are often reluctant
to stick their necks out, as, understand-
ably, they think that their jobs may be in
jeopardy if they do. Students, on Biol-
ogy related courses, are used to work-
ing and living in the field and making
do with basic facilities.
Part of me wonders, probably naively,
why should we have to be lobbying for
things to improve? Shouldn’t College
already be ensuring that we have the
best possible experience? Either way,
it seems College is finally realising that
things need to be improved, perhaps
aware that fees here are increasing by
78% and students will expect more
bang for their buck. This week I at-
tended the first meeting of the Silwood
Action Group, a College Working Party
looking into the student experience at
Silwood. This didn’t really focus on the
longterm picture for Silwood, as I was
anticipating, but I’m hopeful that this
discussion is the start of a transition,
or more appropriately, an ‘evolution’
of Silwood Park. There’s a new MRes
course starting here in October, lecturer
positions replacing the leaving staff
are being advertised soon, the Reactor
Centre is beginning a decommissioning
phase and there are exciting propos-
als for research to return to the Manor
House, which has been empty for the
last three years.
I originally started at Imperial back in
2003, in that time South Kensington has
improved so much, particularly in facil-
ities and support. I am really hoping that
this can happen at Silwood and I look
forward to the campus in years to come.
