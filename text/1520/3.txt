Vote protects future of Polish Club
Polish weekly makes communism claims over Chairman position
surrounding a potential sale of the club
to the Polish Embassy, which the flyer
suggested would be “divisive”.
One of the most controversial rea-
sons listed on the flyer was the claim
that the Chairman of the club had been
a “spy and collaborator in the service
of the discredited Polish 1980s Com-
munist regime”.
Polish weekly Nowy Czas published
an article before Sunday’s vote claim-
ing that chairman of the club Andrzej
Morawicz had once acted as a secret
informer for the regime, and during
this period had been involved with the
export of computer equipment from
Britain to Poland during an embargo
on trade between the two countries.
Following on from Sunday’s vote,
Morawicz and deputy chairman Lu-
cyna Quirke resigned from their posi-
tions on the club’s board.

Wellcome Trust-McMichael Clincial
Research Facility. Teams from the Med-
ical Research Council Clinical Sciences
Centre will be located on the second
floor.
The upper levels will house one of the
largest cardiovascular research facilities
in Europe, including the headquarters of
the British Heart Foundation Centre of
Research Excellence at Imperial.
The property also houses the Imperial
Cancer Research UK Centre.
Chancellor of the Exchequer George
Osborne officially opened the facility,
and said: “It is what this country’s vi-
sion for the future of life sciences is all
about. This new Centre rises to the chal-
lenge of ensuring we remain a world
leader in life sciences. The future is
academic research, clinical practice and
industrial application coming together.”
Osborne also took the opportunity to
discuss the the value of universities:
“I understand that changes in student
finance have prompted a lively debate
about the role of the university. A uni-
versity is not simply a business.
“We understand the importance of
free intellectual enquiry which is worth-
while in itself. It is what I valued about
my time at University – as I suspect did
you too.”
Osborne additionally declared intel-
lectual property advisors Imperial Inno-
vations as a “national leader” in univer-
sities helping to commercially develop
ideas, discoveries or inventions, claim-
ing that “it is a model from which oth-
ers can learn.”
ICTEM has been funded by Impe-
rial College Healthcare NHS Trust, the
British Heart Foundation, the Medical
Research Council and the Wellcome
Trust.
