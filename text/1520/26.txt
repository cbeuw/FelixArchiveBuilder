This week you work at the
Daily Mail. You see Cam-
bridge students doing a
“light-hearted” competition
about which of the boys and
girls that chose to strip down
have the nicest “rears”. You
imply it’s ‘lads’ leering at
women. You then update the
“Femail Today” sidebar with
some sexy bikini pictures.
This week you work at the
Guardian. You’re halfway
through using a bullshit ‘val-
ue added score’ to make
some random poly top of
your tables. Who cares if it’s
misleading and you need 2
Ds to get in, at least nobody
can say you’re a smug elitist.
You close your Macbook Pro,
another day’s work is done.
Oh Aries, what can really
be said. This week is going
to be a trying one for you.
Your housemates stage an
intervention over your uncon-
trollable hand movements
while eating. Forced onto
the streets, you take shelter
undder the Queen’s Tower.
The bells start ringing for the
Jubilee.
You’re sitting in your exam.
You can do this, I believe in
you, sort of. It’s okay, you’re
not supposed to be able to
do ALL the paper. So what if
you miss out b part ii, iii and
iv. Granted you missed out all
of a and have bullshitted b i,
but it’ll be fine. Right. RIGHT.
RIGHT? WHY IS THAT PER-
SON NEXT TO ME CRYING
This week you cry during
your exams to try to get
some sympathy. The lecturer
kindly and calmly walks over
to you and whispers in your
ear ‘maybe you shouldn’t
have gone to Cheapskates
so much you lazy arsehole’.
So much for the whole ‘this is
so hard they probably mark it
really kindly’ hope then...
You’ve finally done it. No, not
gotten a first, don’t be silly.
You’ve finally crossed that all-
important line. Yep. You’ve fi-
nally gone to the toilets in the
library with your shoes off.
Well done, you are officially
living there 24-7. When you
start ‘showering’ in the sinks
in the toilets then it’s time to
accept that fail. Just saying.
You’re cooking in the kitchen.
Then R. Kelly jumps out of the
closet and starts singing...
Man, this is annoying. I mean,
there ain’t nothing wrong with
a little bump n grind, but how
long has he been hiding in
there? And where has this
‘midget’ come from, and why
is he not talking? JLS wouldn’t
pull this shit.
This week you look up what
a ‘homie’ is. Oh Urban Dic-
tionary, I love you. Us middle
class people couldn’t be
‘down with da kidz yo’ if we
didn’t have that. You go to lis-
ten to Kanye West, while you
revise Quantum Mechanics.
Too hood. You get a third, this
is a badman degree. Your
parents disown you.
This week, you and your fuck-
ing irritating friends are in
the computer room shouting
about how you’ve ‘done no
work’ when actually you’ve
been on lockdown revising
when no-one is looking so as
not to hurt your ‘image’. You
lose your phone on the way
home. Or at least that would
happen if there were justice.
“MY MIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII
IIIIIIIIINDS TELLING ME
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
... ... ... BUT MY
BOOOOOOOOOOOOOODY
MY BOOOOOOOOOOODY
IS TELLING ME
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES,” he
screams while gently season-
ing your mushroom omlette
with nutmeg.
This week you go back home
to revise. “But you should just
relax today, I’m sure you’ll
be fine as you’ve worked so
hard. You were working all
day yesterday,” says your
mum. NO. That’s not how ex-
ams work here. Meh, at least
you’re really good at looking
busy. That’s a skill for the real
world. CV here we come.
You missed out the minus
sign by the way. You definite-
ly typed that number incor-
rectly in to your calculator.
They’ll know you skipped that
step in the derivation as you
don’t know it. That equation’s
fraction was the other way
around probably. Oh, sorry,
you had just forgotten all the
things you worried about?

HANGMAN 2.0
hangman.felix@imperial.ac.uk
apreposterousbaLLS-UP!
Two examples proving that the Union doesn’t understand the London dining scene
So here is a comparison of two in-
stitutions. If the words I use are too
big, please email me.
Dinner at the Ivy
One of London’s most notorious
eateries, situated in Soho and
popular with celebrities and thea-
tre goers. Retro chic décor with
stained-glass windows protect
from predatory paparazzi. The
staff all understand the difference
between service and servility, and
between familiarity and over-famil-
iarity. Awarded Moet & Chandon
London Restaurant Award for ex-
cellence in 2000.
Set menu three course meal:
£26.25. Choice between three
starters and three main courses.
Pudding is currently peach and
elderflower jelly with raspberry rip-
ple ice cream.
I rather do say that’s perfection if
you ask me. Better than we had at
the good old Bullingdon Club, and
we only had the finest there.
Dinner at the Summer Ball
Located in the neon-lit SCR. No re-
funds offered as they have no con-
fidence in your enjoyment of the
meal. Suggestions that tickets will
sell out. They won’t. They never do.
Not like the old povvy plebing-
tons have the money to afford
such an event.
Set menu three course meal:
£40 + £10 fine when rubber
stamp on your hand rubs out
from sweat. Cost includes half a
bottle of wine that will taste like
Australian urine. Menu heading
“Starters” misleading as there’s
only one starter and it’s salmon.
Dessert menu only offers pear
& ginger cheesecake with fig
puree. Heston Blumenthal on a
budget? Or worse. Jamie Oliver
They have forked out wads of
cash to present acts that you
don’t give a shit about (can’t a
man get some Wagner!?). For-
tunately, you can avoid these
if you don’t pay the extra £35
charge on top of your dinner
cost. How terribly uncouth.
At least, as they point out, it’s
for One Night Only.
