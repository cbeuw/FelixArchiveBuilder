STAGE
On Tuesday March 15th, at or around
7.30pm the world will be taken over
by a mad scientist. With any luck, this
will happen nightly, until the 18th
when the curtain falls for the last time
on The Physicists, this term's
production by the Dramatic Society.
The Physicists has a simple plot like
a Bond movie. Three really freaked-
out ex-physicists are biding their time
in a lunatic asylum by killing their
nurses in order to take over the world.
After that, comparisons with Bond
movies are a bit stretched. There are
a couple of guns, an evil villain and
a couple of fights. There is also a
particularly blinding love scene and
quite a few good gags, but you never
find these in Bond films.
As director of the play, the first
three have been more than enough
trouble for me. Guns are enormously
effective stage props; they look evil,
actors look evil with one, but only
occasionally do they make the evil
noise they were intended for. I
remember vividly my experience of
a failing stage gun. After two minutes
on stage as a Nazi, having trained my
gun on the male lead for the whole
of this time, I was about to trash him.
With an evil smile on my face, I
pulled the trigger and the damned
thing jammed. Quick as a flash. I
hurled myself at the still unsuspecting
male lead and began choking him with
my left hand, beating his head with
the gun butt and shouting obscenities.
Later on, applause all round for quick
thinking, but the impression left in the
audience's mind must have been 'do
you think the gun didn't go off? If that
guard had intended to beat that
prisoner's brains out he really should
have come on with a mace.'
No such problems with Phillip
Stevens' performance in the Agatha
Christie thriller put on by Southgate
Amateur Dramatic Society. Phillip,
the evil villain, was about to trash
some toad, so he pulled the trigger,
no bang; Southgate Amateur Dramtic
Society—no beginners at the art of
standing up in front of a lot of local
dignitaries with make-up on and
looking and sounding like total
dicks—had a spare gun, which the
stage manager had backstage. She
pulled the trigger and nothing
happened either. Meanwhile, back on
stage, things are getting a bit silly.
Phillip in a flash of inspiration starts
tipping the wink to the other fellow
who, after a few words, falls flat on
his back. Phillip, with a wry smile,
spins to face the audience and says
'poisoned by God!'. That's theatre!
Stage fights can be a trifle
hazardous too, especially if there's a
bit of needle in the cast What with the
adrenalin of performance, anything
can happen and on one occasion it
did. Again, it was Southgate Amateur
Dramatic Society who were the
perpetrators.
This was that stupid scene in one
of those Fling Henry's where Falstaff
had been given to George Bailey, a
retired actor, who ran five
hairdressing salons, a couple of
boutiques and, as was revealed in the
Sunday national papers some weeks
later, a small child prostitution ring.
The Director who thought a little
drunken rough and tumble would
liven the scene up, hadn't counted on
George having a grope around the
codpieces. Master Snare was played
by an earnest rugby-playing bank
clerk called Alan who took his
masculinity very seriously. George
had made a number of not
unfavourable comparisons between
Alan and L'Escargot, the winner of
the 1976 Grand National. George had
often tried to satisfy his curiosity in
rehearsal, and Alan had always leapt
to his feet screaming 'Oi! What's youf
game?'. The director hoped that there
would be no such repetition on the
night. There wasn't. Master Snare hit
Falstaff so hard his front plate swung
into the air as it sailed into the front
row and Mistress Quickly had to pour
a flagon of mead over him so he could
continue the scene. That's theatre!
So come along and see The
Physicists. There's no guarantee
you'll get your wing-wang felt, but
you'll have a good laugh, and you
never know, if you meet some of the
cast before the show, you might be
able to appreciate the play's
Aristotlean structure, but only if we
let you. See you on the night.

FOOTBALL
It is the quarter final of the FA Cup
this week, the last home advantage
round and only two wins to Wembley.
I must apologise for an error last week
concerning Liverpool's fixtures. This
was due to false information from
Bryan 'Pompey Biker' Pitts. There
are incredibly eight matches in
London including five all first
division games.
Arsenal vs Nottingham Forest
Highbury (Arsenal tube)
This is the tie of the round involving
two of the top five teams with a strong
chance of a Wembley victory.
Arsenal are already there in the
Littlewoods Cup and after last week's
2-1 win over near neighbours Spurs
and the exceptional form of Michael
Thomas, they must hope for a win.
Forest haven't won the Cup for 29
years and Brian Clough has never
taken a team along Wembley way in
the greatest football competition in the
world. Cloughie's men kept up their
league challenge with a win at
Sheffield Wednesday last week, Neil
Webb's goal fueling more speculation
of a transfer to Italy. I am going to
plump for a draw, probably 1-1.
Wimbledon vs Watford
Plough Lane (Wimbledon Park tube)
The Windies had the three W's, well
this game pits together two of the first
division's three W's in a Cup clash.
Wimbledon are the only top flight
team never to have graced Brent's
number one ground. They reached
this round last year for the first time
after smashing Everton, but a bad
performance against Spurs ruined
them. A good win, although not
exciting, against Luton gave the Dons
a grounding for this week, with that
man Fashanu notching up number
eighteen. Watford sit at the bottom of
the first division and should really be
concentrating on keeping their top
league status instead of flirting with
Cup exploits. Wimbledon should
make history and roar into the semis
and then go one step further.
Leyton Orient vs Colchester
Brisbane Road (Leytdn tube)
Orient lost again last week and their
promotion hopes seem to be going a
burton. They are ten points off the top
and must finish well to grab a top
three spot. Colchester are mid-table
and lost at home to lowly Wrexham
on Friday night. Frank Clark must be
hopeful of the points here and he
shouldn't be disappointed.
Charlton vs West Ham
Selhurst Park (Selhurst BR)
Charlton gained a valuable point at
Derby last week but their survival bid
seems impossible. They look set to
return to the Valley next year, their
old ground may give the team a new
goal to savour. West Ham have a very
talented side but have been hoying
some steady crap recently towards
their fans. Injuries have not helped
and their desperate search for a striker
to partner Cottee is a real sob story
saga. A dismal draw against Oxford
last week only typified things, Stuart
Robson being the only light. I think
that the Hammers will get done, for
a change....
Chelsea vs Everton
Stamford Bridge (Fulham Bdy tube)
John Hollins' job at the Bridge is most
definitely on the line, and without a
victory since Halloween, times are
more than hard. They were 2-0 up
away at Coventry last week but still
only came away with a draw. The
league champions are twenty points
off the top and this must really hurt.
They were knocked out of three cups
in eight days recently, so their season
is certainly over. They scraped a 1-0
win at home to Newcastle last week
to keep up a slight challenge. I think
Everton will take the points but
Chelsea might make them run for it.
Tottenham vs Norwich
White Hart Lane (Seven Sisters tube)
Two mid-table sides play for points
not prizes with Norwich being the
more eager to win, needing the points
to pull away from relegation danger.
Spurs lost on TV last week and look
OK but a little disjointed, Bobby
Mimms in goal having an awful
game. The Canaries beat Manchester
United last week with Scot recruit
Robert Fleck banging home the
winner. After a good season last year,
things have gone very wrong since
then. Tottenham to grab the trois
points.
Millwall vs Crystal Palace
The Den (New Cross tube)
This is a much awaited game of the
day in the second division between
two promotion hopefuls from the
capital. This division is really hotting
up with play-off places wide open.
These sides are third and fourth, so
this is a real six-pointer. Millwall
could only manage a draw at
Shrewsbury last week whereas Palace
picked up maximum points at home,
Wright getting one more; that's 21
now. This will be a real ding-dong
battle and a prediction is only for the
brave. A draw!
Brentford vs Bury
Griffin Park (Brentford Central)
Steve Perryman's Brentford have
thrown away any slight promotion
hopes they might have had, finalising
in a 4-2 defeat at Walsall last week.
I remember Bury (the shortest club
name in the league) losing 10-0 to
West Ham and are now having a
mediocre season. They have ex-
international Sammy Mcllroy and old
baldy Noel Brotherstone in their
squad. Brentford to pick up at least
a point.
My last four for the Cup
Liverpool, Arsenal (just, maybe after
a replay or two), Wimbledon and
Luton. (Bye, bye Pompey).
