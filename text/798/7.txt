KORFBALL
Going to seed
British Student Championships
On February 27 London University
Korfball Team (including six players
from Imperial) travelled to Sheffield
for the British Student
Championships. Seeded first, they
completed early victories against
Bulmarsh College (who?) 8-0,
Sheffield University 11-1 and
Lancaster University 8-1. U L then
faced third favourites Brighton, last
year's winners, started well with an
early goal and ruffled U L who took
their time to find an equaliser. Goals
were exchanged quickly and at half-
time UL turned around leading 3-2.
By the second half UL had regained
their rhythm and two well-worked
running-in shots produced goals.
Brighton rallied again but U L kept
control and ran out winners 6-3 in a
keenly contested game.
In the semi-finals UL faced Oxford
University, and, after a tentative start,
UL romped home by 10-2. The game
was no preparation for the final,
which cannot be said of the other
semi-final. By common consensus the
game between Brighton and York was
the most exciting student game seen
for a long time.
After Brighton defeated Oxford for
third place, the scene was set for the
final everyone was expecting: London
versus York. York scored,
immediately with a long shot,
although London soon equalised. The
game then slowed from its initial
frantic pace, with Catherine Foster
and Jacky Knowles (IC) playing
brilliantly in defence to prevent York
using their strong girls for goals, and
the whole team settling into a more
tactical game. U L scored goals
through Helen Grainger, top scorer
of the tournament, Russell Norton
(IC) and Patrick Wright (IC) and
turned around at 4-3. At no point in
the game was there a difference of
more than one goal, and violent
defence from all combined with
controlled attacking which resulted in
a 6-5 lead to UL with three minutes
left to play. Conscious of the
barracking U L received for time-
wasting at an earlier tournament, UL
continued to attack defensively. The
last three minutes were played at such
a pace that no one really noticed the
final whistle go. Relief! We'd
regained our lost title, but it was just
too close!
RIFLE A N D PISTOL
Such a card
Wednesday March 2, the date for the
Rifle and Pistol Club's match against
Reading University. The first part of
the match was to be rifle and shot over
two cards. After the first card time
was running short so the second card
wasn't shot and the scores on the first
card were doubled. With the best six
scores counting this gave a fairly close
score out of 1200 of:
A good all round performance by
the team of Paul Deeks, Andrew
James, Ian Draper, Mike Lacey,
Nigel Ford, Roger Winskill, Ann-
Marie Bruinsma, James Primrose
giving a final score of:

A quick substitution of Mike Lacey
for Anne-Marie set us up for the pistol
part of the match. This too was shot
over two cards, the best six to count.
Good performances by Paul Deeks,
Ian Draper and Roger Winskill and
scores of 9 and 13 out of 100 by
Reading giving pistol scores out of
1200 of:
Reading
IC

A little bit upset at being so soundly
beaten Reading then challenged us to
a rifle match against their ' A ' team
to be shot at Bisley and Reading. This
will be shot next term so look out for
the report.
Finally, there are still a few places
available for our trip to Bisley on
Wednesday March 16. If you are
interested (and a member) come down
to the range and sign up. If you're
interested in learning to shoot we
always welcome new members and
will be quite happy to teach you the
basics so come and join.
H O C K E Y
Six of the best
Six-a-side hockey is a game played on
a full size pitch but with only six
players, it is similar in style to seven-
a-side rugby, requiring a high level
of fitness and tactical ability, at least
that's the theory. IC sent two sides to
the ULU sixes tournament (Sunday
March 6), a first team and an 'all star'
second team. The early games were
on a divisional round robin system,
4 divisions made up of the 20 teams
taking part. IC all stars drew their first
game against St George's Medical
School and then went downhill not
winning a game,
Meanwhile however IC 1st were
doing a little better beating Charing
Cross by 3-1 with a couple of good
goals from Paul Skipworth and one
from the dynamic Hari Vamadevan.
Sound defensive play by Guilds
ensured a 0-0 draw and 6 very
frustrated players. IC went on to win
their group winning 3 out of 4 games
and 1 draw. There were however a
few tense moments, particularly when
John Stonham scored in a tight game
against St Thomas's II, a good goal
scored in injury time and one he'll no
doubt keep reminding us of. In the last
eight IC palyed RHBNC II who they
defeated 2-0 in a game which they
always had the upper hand in. Of
particular note was an aerial shot from
the hard working Justin Brooking
which set up a good goal for Paul
Skipworth. who also scored possibly
the best goal of the tournament, a flick
over his left shoulder and a sweet half
volley, into the right hand corner of
the goal. The crowd went wild. I was
unable to see their semi-final against
QMC I, who are IC's main rivals for
the ULU League title this year, but
it was at this stage that they stepped
up a gear, scoring 3 good goals and
totally out-classing their opposition.
And so to the final against QMC's old
boys who included a present IC
undergraduate Brendan Farmer.
IC went in front early through a
goal from Vamedevan, who had been
curiously quiet before and then had
several more very good chances to
seal it in the first half but failed to find
the net. Into the second half it became
more a game of attrition with few
. chances and some very hard tackling
from both sides, but the result was
never really in doubt. The final
whistle went and IC were champions.
Sources close to the side decribed
their performance as 'masterful' and
quotes like 'we're all stars' were
audible in the bar afterwards. My
juvenile little quips aside, it was a
very good victory, something we've
not managed recently despite very
good sides in the last couple of years.
It must in the end go down as a team
result although a couple of players.
John Stonham and Paul Skipworth.
were outstanding and occasionally
brilliant.

Inadequate
The OSC All Stars have won the first
International Week Basketball
Tournament after beating Greece
86-55 in the final, while IC Basketball
conquered the 3rd place by defeating
Cyprus 54-32.
All the games were of unusually
good quality for British universities,
due to the very professional attitude
of all the teams, referees and officials.
It is a shame that the College does not
have an adequate gym with the
minimum required size or. at least,
that the necessary equipment is not
properly maintained and cleaned.
The full results were as follows:

IC Basket-38 Greece-52
OSC All Stars-86 Cyprus-38

SAILING
Crew cut
IC vs Eyesores
Last Saturday. IC sailing team raced
against Eyesores at the Welsh Harp
Reservoir in Wembley. Although IC
were sailing well, they were narrowly
beaten in the morning races b\
Eyesore's superior racing. However
after a change of helms IC managed
to improve their performance. Some
stunning sailing b\ Sam Pace, sadly
handicapped bv her inexperienced
crew helped 1L^ to pull ahead of
Eyesore's team. Consistent sailing b\
Jenny Burton then brought IC level
with Eyesore, her crew. the captain,
proved to be rather argumentative and
hindered Jenny's beautiful helming so
teams were once again changed.
IC then raced ahead, and thanks to
Ape sailing the correct course, finally
beat the Evesores in the last races.
