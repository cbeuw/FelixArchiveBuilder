When computers want to store large
amounts of information, they almost
always have to use some form of
magnetic recording medium.
Recently, however, optical methods
have started to become more
common. Recent announcement*
from ICI and 3M are likely to
accelerate the move to optical storage.
Optical methods can pack much
more information into a given space
than magnetic devices. For example,
an ordinary Compact Disk can store
almost a gigabyte (1,000,000,000
bytes) of information or about 1000
floppy disks' worth. This is big
enough to store a large encyclopaedia
and a large dictionary, indeed such
things are already available for
microcomputers. Disks cost about
£100 and the drives (which can play
your music CD's as well) about £500.
Scientists will probably use them to
distribute things like Chemical
Abstracts, which normally takes up
about three metres of bookshelf every
year. A single CD is rather smaller
than this and can be searched rapidly
by computer.
The trouble with CDs is that you
can't put your own information on
them. You can get writable optical
discs, but they cost horrendous
amounts of money and they still
cannot be erased (though when you
have a gigabyte this is rarely a
problem). But 3M have developed an
erasable optical disk based on thin
films of rare earth metals. Lasers
write to the disk by warming a small
spot while the disk is in a magnetic
field. This changes the magnetic state
at the spot, which is detected by its
effect on the polarisation of a weak
laser beam. The process is reversible
and so the disks can be repeatedly
reused, just like ordinary magnetic
floppies. They estimate that the cost
will be about £2 per megabyte, about
ten times cheaper than conventional
hard disks.
Considering all this, it may seem
strange that ICI has recently
announced a new mass storage
medium based on paper. Well, it's not
ordinary paper, but a plastic sandwich
of a dye polymer. It costs about the
same as good quality paper to make.
Information is stored by burning holes
in the dye using an infra-red laser.
The cost of information storage works
out at less than lp per megabyte
(compared to floppy disks at about £1
per megabyte for very limited
capacity). The paper can be made in
vast sheets and cut into disks or long
strips.
Again, it is not erasable, but it is
so cheap that hardly matters. The only
problem is that no one has built a
storage device based on it yet. When
they do, a single reel of digital paper

Plastic paper for computers
tape will store about one terabyte of
information (this is about fifty times
more than the sort of magnetic tape
used as mass storage on mainframe
computers; conveniently, it is about
the amount of satellite data NASA
expect to process every day by 1995).
Whether digital paper will ever
make its way into the microcomputer
market depends on how cheap laser-
based disk or tape drives can be made.
Hopefully, whatever comes along will
be cheap and more robust than the
average floppy disk.
Patenting Life
If the creationists are right about
world history, then American Law
insists that all farmers should be
paying royalties to God.
The US Patent and Tradmark
Office has recently announced that it
will accept patents on genetically
altered animals and plants. Such
things are now possible for ordinary
mortals as well as the Almighty. This
has caused some degree of
consternation among religious
figures, who reckon that fiddling with
life in this way is a breach of God's
copyright. However, since He forgot
to stake his claim with the patent
office, no legal action is possible.
On the other hand, environmen-
talists have found other legal ways to
object to genetically altered beasties.
They have found various dodges to
prevent field testing of a genetically
altered bacterium in California (the
bug had had its genes altered to
prevent it making a protein that
caused crop-damaging ice crystals to
form). The environmentalists were
worried that a Frankenstein bug might
be released that could cause more
trouble than it cured.
We now know how to make
genetically altered animals as well as
bugs. But according to the American
Patent Office '.. .unauthorised acts of
reproduction of patented animals
would seem to be an infringement of
patent law...'. This seems likely to
cause some annoyance to farmers,
who will have to enforce strict sexual
segregation on their beasts or pay
royalties on the resulting progeny.

Cancer and the Voters
The State of California held a
referendum last year on a law that
tries to completely ban carcinogenic
chemicals from the environment. It
won overwhelming support, despite
opposition from scientists.
The law insists on tight control on
chemicals known to cause cancer or
birth defects (for example, companies
using nasty compounds have to post
warnings in public places). This may
seem reasonable, but it is the strict
definitions in the law that make it
dubious. They may indeed also make
it ridiculous.
The law was promoted by a
widespread fear that dangerous
chemicals were being leaked into
public water suplies, or used as food
additives and so on. The ogres of the
chemical and electronics industries
were thought to be taking a cavalier
attitude to public safety. Such an
attitude has been worsened by the
secretive behaviour of the offending
companies: if they had taken the effort
to keep people informed then they
might never have aroused public
disapproval.
The strict limits enshrined in the
law are going to make it difficult for
some companies to operate at all
(even though the Governor has
interpreted them as loosely as
possible). The law effectively
assumes that any compound is
dangerous if it causes cancer or birth
defects in animals at any level of
exposure. This ignores much of the
evidence suggesting that animal
experiments overestimate the danger
of many compounds (there are some
classic examples of this: penicillin
kills hamsters and aspirin kills cats).
The law's real mistake is that it
assumes that all nasties are man-
made. There are plenty of pretty
horrible compounds that are perfectly
natural. Many food products contain
small amounts of deadly natural
nasties (but not enough to do any
damage) that the law does nothing to
regulate. Anyway the biggest source
of man-made cancer is not the
indiscriminate efforts of the chemical
industry, but individual choice.
People choose to smoke tobacco and
to eat unhealthy diets, they are not
forced to do either. But no
environmentalist is trying to ban
cigarettes from sale, or to force
MacDonalds to put health warnings
on their burgers.
Editor's Bit
One of the problems in California is
that the scientists never bothered to
tell the people what they were doing
and why, so the people got
suspicious. Scientists have got to tell
people what they are about or this sort
of thing is bound to happen.
A good place to practice is here.
This very space in FELIX could be
yours. If you have a good news story
or a good feature article, send it to
me (Chem Eng letter racks, the
FELIX Office, or phone int 4642).
Several people have promised me
features on various topics, but very
few have, as yet, materialised. If you
have anything, I suggest you get it to
me before Easter, you won't have the
time afterwards.
And, if anyone wants to be Science
Editor next year, now is the time to
start thinking about it.
