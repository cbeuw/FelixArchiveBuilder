College Welfare
Adviser Linda
Simmonds looks at
the facts and
figures of housing
benefits for
1988-89 in a follow
up to her article
earlier this term
The new system of assessing Housing
Benefit is almost upon us. As I explained
in the article which appeared in last
term's FELIX, the changes are part of
a wide ranging 'reform' of the social
security system which among other
things will replace supplementary benefit
with Income Support.
As far as Housing Benefit is
concerned, however, the main changes
affect the method of assessment NOT
who is eligible. Most students,
therefore, will still be able to claim HB.
(The main exceptions will be as at
present, those living in college halls and
houses and most overseas students).
How to work out your Housing
Benefit after April 1st 1988
1) Have you capital (ie savings,
property, stocks and shares etc) worth
more than £6,000? If so, you will be
ineligible for Housing Benefit.
If you have capital of £3000 or less,

then it will be ignored (ie it will have
no effect on your claim to HB).
If you have capital between £3,000
and £6,000, £1 will be added on to the
figure used to calculate your weekly
income for every £250 (or part thereof)
you have between these figures.
2) You now need to work out your
weekly income net of tax. This includes
money coming into you regularly from
any source (eg grants, bursaries,
sponsorships, covenants, parental
contributions, earnings from part-time
jobs, plus any income generated by
capital under 1) above).
If you are on a standard undergraduate
maintenance grant of £2,330, this will
work out as income of £52.92 per week
in 1987/88 once the amounts for books
and equipment and travel have been
deducted.
Any earnings which you receive from
part-time jobs will have a certain
amounts disregarded for purposes of this
calculation. These amounts are:
Single claimant: £5 per week
Couple: £10 per week
Lone parent
or disabled: £15 per week
Now deduct £17.80 (this corresponds
with the student reduction in eligible
rent).
3) Work out your weekly rent and rates.
If your rent is inclusive of heating, you
will have to deduct an amount for this
from your rent. If you do not know how
much the heating element is, the local
authority will deduct a standard amount
(currently.about £7).
For calculation purposes your rent will
be divided into rent and rates. If you do
not know how much your rates are, they
are usually 25-30% of the total rent.
Deduct £17.80 from the rent element.
No deductions are made from the rates.
4) The amount of Housing Benefit you
get will depend on the difference
between your weekly income and an
Applicable Amount which is made up
from two elements.
a) A personal allowance related to
age; whether the claimant is claiming as
one of a couple or not; and whether the
claimant has children or not.
b) A premium related to family status,
disability and whether the claimant is a
pensioner.
In this article I will not quote the
Applicable Amounts for those with
children or disabilities; please ask at the
Welfare Centre for details.
Applicable Amounts
Single claimant:
aged under 18 £19.40
aged 18-24 inclusive £26.05
aged 25 + £33.40
Couple:
both aged under 18 £38.80
at least one aged 18 + £51.45
Once you have worked out your
applicable amount you will be ready to
do the calculation.
5) The calculation
If your income is equal to or below your
applicable amount, you will be entitled
to maximum HB. This will be:
100% of rent
80% of rates
If your income is above your applicable
amount you must:
Deduct 65 % of the difference between
your applicable amount and your income
from the maximum rent HB.
Deduct 20% of the differencefromthe
maximum rates HB.
Example
A 20 year old undergraduate student's
only income is his/her grant of £52.92
per week.
S/he pays a weekly rent exclusive of
heating etc of £40, including rates of £10
per week and is not one of a couple.
1)Applicable amount:
in this case it will be £26.05
2) Weekly income:
£52.92 - £17.80 = £35.12
3) Eligible income:
£40 - £10 - £17.80 = £12.20
4) Calculation:
Difference between Applicable Amount
and Income = £9.07
Entitlement to Housing Benefit
HB for rent:
100% of eligible rent £12.20
Less 65% of £9.07 - £ 5.89
£ 6.31
HB for rates:
80% of rates
Less 20% of £9.07
Total HB
£ 8.00
-£ 1.81
£ 6.19
£12.50
In this article, I have only been able to
give a brief outline of the new scheme,
if you need further information please
ask at the Welfare Centre at 15 Princes
Gardens.
