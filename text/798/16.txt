Geology on shaky ground
The University Grants Committee has
recommended changes which would
reduce funding to IC's Geology
department. A review committee, set
up to suggest reorganisation of earth
science courses throughout the
country, has divided geology
departments into three categories.
Within each type, departments have
been split into two groups: the first
to receive increased resources, the
second to get no increase or a slight
reduction. Imperial is classed in the
second group of category T , which
is meant to contribute to inter-
disciplinary as well as mainstream
earth sciences, concentrating on
multiple rather than single honours.
East Anglia and Lancaster are in the
first group of this type. The other
categories are ' M ' , in which
departments provide teaching,
including single honours, and
research in mainstream earth
sciences, and ' J ' , which indicates
universities offering joint honours and
service teaching but which do not
have expensive research equipment.
Group T of type ' M ' includes
Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh,
Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool,
while Group '2' includes Durham,
Cardiff, Leicester and Glasgow.
A great deal of controversy
surounds this review. New Scientist
recently published a story claiming
that some oil companies had been
shown a letter stating that IC's
Geology department was to be axed
completely; and The Guardian,
March 10th, quoted Dr Peter Smith,
scientific editor of Geology Today, as
saying the review had been 'watered
down by a few people protecting their
vested interests'.

difficulties in paying the expenses of

booked for the remainder of the term.
In a committee meeting on
Wednesday CU agreed to put a
motion, removing the contentious
clauses from their constitution, to a
Union General Meeting. They are
also investigating whether or not
survival would be possible outside IC
Union.
Members of the Christian Union

time was spent in discussing the issue:
only eleven days elapsed between the
UFC meeting where the issue was
first raised and the Council which
expelled them from the Union. They
are also concerned that they were not
kept properly informed about the
situation facing them. Had they more
information, they said, they could
have presented a better case to
Council.

The highly criticised new legislation,
Section 43 of the Education Act,
recently brought in by the
Government to safeguard freedom of
speech has been shown to be
unworkable following an incident at
Wolverhampton Polytechnic last
week.
The Polytechnic's Conservative
Students Association invited South
African Embassy Secretary Louis
Mullinder to address a private
meeting on 'Dismantling Apartheid'.
A fight broke out when several
students interrupted the meeting and
the student union subsequently
withdrew membership from two
Conservative students for organising
the meeting. The Polytechnic's
director is now taking legal advice as

Neil Motteram (External Affairs
Officer) and Neil McCluskey
(Internal Services Officer). Paul
Shanley was returned unopposed as
U G M Chairman after Sydney
Harbour-Bridge withdrew from the
election.
Four Departmental Representatives
have also been returned: Sarah Vant

Ritsperis (Maths).

reinstate the two. students. If he is
successful, this could have serious
repercussions for all British students'
unions.
This incident has led to calls by
right-wingers for tighter restrictions
on student unions and guaranteed free
speech in all universities in the new
Education Reform Bill.
Meanwhile Wolverhampton
Polytechnic's director Michael
Harrison has insisted that the current
legislation is unworkable because they
had done everything to ensure that
trouble would not occur but it still
did. At the moment, he said, 'there
is no means of enforcing free speech
and no penalty for a breach of it.'

Two con-women have been operating
in the Evelyn Gardens residences.
They have been persuading students
to pay £15 a month as part of a
financial planning service they claim
to offer students. Both women were
seen using the same car but different
company names. When they were
challenged in Holbein House, they
said that they did not know one
another and that they had been given
permission to canvas by Imperial
College.

The 1988 Directory for the

been published. It contains over 150
offers and copies are available from
Departmental Vacation Training
Representatives or from Mrs Ibsen,
Room 713, Electrical Engineering.
The University of Delaware is
offering five summer vacation
bursaries for research at Delaware
and applications should be in by the
end of this term. The bursary is worth
$1500 for ten weeks but students have
to find their own fare. Mrs Ibsen has
a Delaware UROP directory which
gives the areas of research
available—they cover all of science
and engineering. Students wishing to
register should see Prof J C
Anderson, Room 804, Electrical

academic records in their department
have the best chance of being selected
and decisions will be made during the
Easter vacation.
