The Student's Union at Silwood Park is fighting to obtain
accommodation promised by College administration for its full-time
postgraduates following the sale of Sandyride House. Sandyride, a
five acre property, was acquired by the Sherfield Trust in 1970 in
order to provide accommodation for married overseas students but
was sold so that new upgraded blocks could be built. Two of these
blocks will be completed within the next two months but Silwood
Administrator Mr Keith Fisher is no longer willing to guarantee that
all these places will be available to full-time Silwood students.
The two new blocks contain six two- he doesn't feel that the William
person flats and sixteen single rooms.
College Secretary John Smith told
FELIX yesterday that the flats will be
occupied by married students from
Sandyride and that the single rooms
will be used this summer to house
short course students. Mr Fisher said
that no decision had yet been made
as to who would live in the single
rooms after the summer.
Silwood Union Chairman Willy
Munro is concerned that Mr Fisher
is not prepared to guarantee these
places, especially as the Union had
been led to believe that the sale of
Sandyride would create more
accommodation for full-time students.
He wants as many students as possible
from William Penney Hall, another
Silwood residence which is going to
be refurbished this year, to be moved
to the new block as soon as it is
completed. Mr Munro believes that
this will give current Silwood students
the immediate benefit of the improved
facilities that the new block will
provide plus give sufficient places for
short course students.
Mr Fisher has told the Union that
he will not accept this plan because
Penney rooms will be of a high
enough standard to be used for the
post-experience short course students.
Mr Munro has condemned this
attitude as the new block has kitchen
facilities which the short course
students would not need. William
Penney, however, has very poor
kitchens and would be much better
suited to short stay tenants.
Mr Fisher will not make a decision
on this matter until the two blocks
have been completed. Mr Munro,
with the backing of the South
Kensington Union, wants College's
House Committee to promise that the
block will be made available to the
William Penney residents as soon as
it is ready and that priority will be
given to full-time students in the
future.
Mr Smith told FELIX that the
refurbishment of William Penney
would take up to a year to complete.
He also said that there were plans to
make the main house into a
conference centre when the Biology
Department moves out and more short
course accommodation would be
built.
Will we
CU again?
Christian Union (CU) were thrown
out of Imperial College Union last
Monday when ICU Council ruled that
their current constitution violates ICU
by-laws.
As reported in FELIX last week,
clauses in the C U constitution had
been objected to. These clauses
required all members to sign a
statement of belief, required
committee members to sign a further
'doctrinal basis', and stated that any
speaker at CU meetings had to 'have
views in accordance with the doctrinal
basis'.
The ICU by-laws state that Union
facilities should be open to all IC
students, and this had hitherto been
interpreted to mean that any student
should be allowed to join any club or
society. At the Council meeting, CU
put the case that an exception should
be made to this rule. They had been
in contact with the University &
College Christian Federation (UCCF)
who insist that Christian Unions
within the federation must conform to
their membership and speaker
restrictions. Should these be lifted,
CU could not continue to receive
UCCF support.
Council also refused to allow the
CU access to their allotted Union
funds for the remainder of the year
as they were no longer considered to
be a valid Union club, but yesterday's
Union Finance Committee (UFC)
voted to let them keep all membership
monies and donations which they had
deposited in their account this year.
CU treasurer, Athos Ritsperis, said
that he had heard 'conflicting reports'
about the status of CU's funds for this
year and would not attempt to
withdraw any money until the matter
continued on back page
