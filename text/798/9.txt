Luxuria
Unanswerable Lust
Howard Devoto, tx-Buzzcocks and
Magazine frontman is in partnership
with guitarist Noko in his latest
venture Luxuria.
I'm glad to see he still retains his
rare grasp of the English language.
These songs are narrated rather than
sung in a whining drawl. Side A
contributes nothing being too
grandiose and pompous.
Side B contains all that is worth
listening to. 'Celebrity' is the most
outstanding with its flashing guitar,
Mile however is a bit over the top
lyrically—quoting Marcel Proust!
Luxuria are playing the Town and
Country Club on March 13, which is
definitely worth going to.
(Beggars Banquet)
The title 'Cuba' may lend your
record collection a bit of credibility
though.

The Lilac Time
Silos
Cuba
The Silos it would appear from the
sleeve, (which also depicts a nude
man playing guitar on the reverse)
hail from the USA. I'm afraid to say
that the sleeve is the most exciting
part of this album. Drawling
American vocals combine with simple
guitar riffs and a monotonous drum
beat to produce an almost wimpish
sound. Bands like this have British
equivalents in Indie acts of The
Chesterfields ilk.
Well this is typical Indie pop, light
and frothy, but unusually the vocals
are very strong making this rather
good. Their style reminds me of
Deacon Blue charting at present with
'Dignity', I'm sure the singer is
Steven Duffy, responsible for the hit
'Kiss Me' a few years ago.
The best track is 'Return to
Yesterday' which is infuriatingly
catchy and was I think available on
a single. 'Rockland' is a bit of social
political criticism, but delivered up in
this style will anyone notice? I doubt
it.

12 Songs Never Recorded by
Frank Sinatra
Similar to a number of bands, The
Chevalier Brothers and The Jivin'
Instructors spring to mind, this is pure
Rock 'n' Roll. If your taste is for
honky-tonk piano, R 'n' R guitSr and
a thumping double-bass this will go
down very well.
A band worth going to see because
of the atmosphere at a gig which can't
be captured on vinyl.

Woodenfoot Cops on the
Highway-The Woodentops
If you have ever seen the Woodentops
live you'll know the energy that Rolo
and his chums can generate. Energy
that was not really captured on their
first slab of vinyl 'Giant'. This time
however the boys have come good.
'Woodenfoot Cops ' is proof
that dance music can be tuneful and
doesn't have to be cribbed (ie
sampled) from James Brown. But
that's not to say that its dated at all,
Rolo is definitely moving with the
times—this man's no stick-in-the-
mud.
The surprise track of the album is
'Wheels Turning' which has a wailing
heavy-metal guitar over that
Woodentops' acoustic strum. The
highlight for me though is the single
'You Make Me Feel'. A juicy pedal
steel guitar and beautiful lyrics
combine to produce a truly heavenly
song.
Oh yes, last week's review of
Cleveland contained a comparison to
McCarney (who's he?). Thankfully
they sound nothing at all like the
aforementioned; it should have read
McCarthy, the jangle-popsters from
South London. But then you all knew
that, didn't you?

The Fall
HMV Oxford Circus
This appearance was rather unusual
for The Fall who aren't associated
with commercialism. The store was
full of people packed in between the
racks of Bruce Springsteen CDs.
They played six tracks five from the
'Frenz Experiment' (Beggars
Banquet) and one I'd not heard
before. After a little touble with the
microphones the full blast of Mark E
Smith's vocals were released, these
overlay the repetitive guitar riffs to
create a hypnotic effect. Hecklers
shouting out for their favourite songs
were put down with the reply 'never
heard of that one'.
I'm not sure everyone appreciated
the humour of some of the songs, the
start of 'Carry Bag Man' being
hysterically funny but provoking little
reaction.
If you missed this go and see them
at Hammersmith Odeon on March 18,
even if it is only for the experience.
F.A.B.
The Living Daylights
Timothy Dalton's first attempt
surpasses all previous Bond movies
by a long chalk. Action, adventure,
an Aston Martin and Marian d'Abo.
What more could you ask for? A
clever plot to keep you guessing right
to the end. That's in there somewhere
too.
The Secret of My Success
A simple story of everyday folk.
Country boy meets city girl, they fall
in love, and in the intervening
moments they take over a
multinational company. It could
happen to you or me. Packed with
humour, and very enjoyable, yet
shallow in comparison to Michael J
Fox's two major successes, Back to
the Future and the Pepsi commercial.
Platoon
Oliver Stone's Oscar-winning story of
one young boy's experiences in
Vietnam. Possibly the best attempt
since The Deer Hunter and certainly
not just another war film. Touches of
humour and some stunning
camerawork make this a must.
Raw Deal
There are no cyborgs, alien hunters
or cavemen in this film. There's no
acting either. Schwarzenegger attacks
the film with his 'let's just have some
fun because I can't act' attitude,
reminiscent of Commando. He also
attacks most other things in sight.
The Fly
Jeff Goldblum, co-starring with an
anonymous insect, in a remake of the
sixties horror movie of the same
name. The humour comes almost as
thick and fast as the gore, in typical
Cronenberg style. Don't be fooled—
this is a love story, and your heart will
flutter when your stomach isn't
churning.
