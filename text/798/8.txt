Barfly (cert 18)
Barfly starts with a fight and ends with
a fight. Anything could have
happened in the middle and the result
would have been exactly the same.
Henry Chinaski (Mickey Rourke)
is a society drop-out who prefers the
low life of seedy downtown LA to the
'unreality' of the outside world. His
life revolves around the bottle and he
is at his happiest when attempting to
beat his enemy, Eddie the bartender,
into a pulp. Understandably these
fights do not satisfy his artistic needs
so in his spare time he writes poetry
and short stories.
Enter Wanda (Faye Dunaway) a
very cynical drunk who is a bit crazy.
Naturally they fall in love, albeit a
strange kind of love, thriving as it
does on infidelity, violence and abuse
(Wanda must be the most bloodthristy
handbag wielder in cinema history).
Barfly is a strange mixture which
leaves you puzzled at times. It is not
typical of the glossy production
audiences are used to these days,
reminding one more of a low budget
remnant from the early seventies with
the music of Booker T and the MGs
and a yellow tinge to the film.
Whereas there was a kind of glamour
in Mickey Rourke's sleaziness in
Angel Heart, here there is none.
Henry is stark and coarse. He is fat
and greasy, a modern-day Quasimodo
without the social graces. 'Why do
you act like a bum?' asks Tully
Sorenson, a rich literary editor,
'Because I am a bum,' replies
Rourke. The part must have been
written for him.
The idea of reconciling this image
with that of a sensitive writer is asking
too much. Likewise, it is impossible
to believe that the attractive, refined
Tully Sorenson should fall for his
charm, or lack of it. Henry beds her
then and she comes back clamouring
for more.
Very little else happens. The
performances are good but the film
is altogether too low-key for there to
be much else to appreciate. Ultimately
it disappoints because so little happens
and everyone seems quite happy
about the fact, especially Henry who
celebrates his lack of achievement by
picking a fight with Eddie.
Don't waste more than £2 on a
Monday night to see this one.

SHOWING
Fatal Attraction (cert 18)
If you can cope with the initial tedium
of this film while it (very slowly)
builds up to the exciting if predictable
climax then you'll probably come out
feeling that it deserves its six Oscar
nominations. I couldn't and didn't,
but that puts me in a minority of one.
See it for yourself.
Robocop (cert 18)
Possibly the most violent movie due
out this year, and no doubt the biggest
hype. A shocking version of 'the
future of law enforcement',
destruction interspersed with black
humour, sadness and a series of
emotionally disturbing scenes. The
only thing our hero can't deal with is
the business politics which created
him.
No Way Out (cert 15)
A spy thriller, set almost entirely in
the Pentagon, with brilliant
performances by Kevin Costner and
Hine Hackman. The nail-biting finish
will have you on the edge of your
seat, and the final scene is a real
stinger.
Cry Freedom (cert PG)
Attenborough's poignant study of
apartheid in South Africa,
concentrating on the story of Donald
Woods and his friendship with Steven
Biko. Everything about this film is
right, its style and execution
especially, and though I found it
perhaps a touch too long, it is no
surprise to see it is still showing in
Leicester Square after three months.
White Mischief (cert 18)
A fairly pointless film based quite
loosely on a true story of murder
amongst the upper-middle classes
during their African holiday. Any of
you planning a visit to see Greta
Scaachi romping nude for an hour—
you'll be quite disappointed.

Someone to Watch Over Me
Someone to Watch Over Me is another
in a batch of recently released sex-
related thrillers such as Fatal
Attraction, No Way Out and Stakeout,
and it suffers from comparison with
the rest of the pack. It hasn't the
excitement of Fatal Attraction, has
none of the intrigue of No Way Out
and can't match Stakeout for humour.
Having said this, it is the maturist
attempt amongst the bunch, and deals
with morality better than Fatal
Attraction ever pretended to; if not as
well as was possible. This makes it
more of a pity that it doesn't work,
as there has recently been a dearth of
well-written adult-oriented films
which also manage to entertain as well
as occupy the mind (a la Angel Heart
and Mona Lisa).
The story concerns itself with the
relationship between a newly
promoted cop (Tom Berenger, last
seen in Platoon) and a witness to a
brutal murder (Mimi Rogers) that
Berenger is protecting, and how this
relationship is threatening Berengers
marriage to his cop-wife (a show-
stealing performance by Lorraine
Bracco).
The problem is that although the
director, Ridley Scott (of Alien, Blade
Runner and Legend) knows how to
make a film look good, he doesn't
develop the relationship between the
working-class Berenger and the high-
class Rogers with enough conviction.
It originally resembles Bob Hoskins
and Cathy Tyson's mis-matched love-
hate encounter in Mona Lisa
(especially when it rips-off the 'lower-
class man who doesn't know how to
look classy getting bought clothes by
the rich fashion-concious women'
routine). However it improves as the
emotions simmer below the surface,
and Berengers wife can detect the
change in him, but it finally collapses
to a level barely above soap opera, as
a weak script finally manages to bring
it down.
The action side is handled more
confidently as a villan looking like a
psychopathic Victor Mature brings a
tension to his scenes, that the rest of
the picture sorely lacks. And it is
reassuring to see the grimy streets of
New York back in the thriller after
a period of neglect, but not even they
can detract your attention from the
fact that the plot aspires to the level
of a run-of-the-mill cop-show.
There are treats for the eye
(especially when the smoke machines
go into overtime for the night scenes)
and treats for the ear (i.e. Sting's
rendition of the title song during the
credits), but I left wishing that they'd
been something more for me to watch
over.
