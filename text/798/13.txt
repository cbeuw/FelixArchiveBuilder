AMNESTY
Letter
writing
On Thursday March 17, the IC
Amnesty Group will be holding a
sponsored Write-a-thon in the JCR,
from 9.30am to 5.30pm. We will be
writing letters for prisoners of
conscience (people detained anywhere
for their beliefs, colour, sex, ethnic
origin, language or religion, provided
they have neither used nor advocated
violence) from all over the world
(more than 25 countries at present),
from left-wing, right-wing and non-
aligned countries as Amnesty is
totally apolitical. Please come along
and give us your support by
sponsoring us and/or by signing a
letter, petitions and postcards!
If you would like to take part in the
Write-a-thon (not necessarily for all
of the 8 hours) please contact Guy
Sims, Maths 2 for sponsorship forms.
FOLK SOC
Sing-a-longa
SCR
ICU Folk Club has been resurrected
from the death it died in 1981, but is
still dependent on enthusiasm from
continued survival. If you're into any
sort of folk music, then this is the club
for you. Our aim is to promote the
playing and enjoyment (and singing)
of folk music amongst students.
So far this year, members of Folk
Club have performed at the Holland
Club and also during Rag Week in
SCAB Nite and the RCS smoking
concert.
We meet every Tuesday lunchtime
at 1pm in Huxley 140—far from the
madding crowd so no one can hear us.
Anyone who plays anything is
welcome.
This weekend, on Saturday March
12, we are having a 'singaround' in
the Union SCR (the room above
Norman's) from 7pm-llpm. If you
play bring your instrument, if you
sing bring your voice and if you don't
do either then bring your enthusiasm.
When Verdi presented his Requiem
in Vienna in 1874, the German
composer Hans von Bulow
condemned the work to such an extent
that Brahms was moved to study it
'Bulow', he proclaimed, 'has made an
ass of himself; Verdi's Requiem is a
work of genius.'
Verdi was prompted to write the
work by the death of a friend the
novelist Manzoni in 1873. The work
is highly theatrical. The dramatic
music alienated many to whom a
Requiem should be an affair of
sombre sadness and austerity. Most
listeners respond to its vibrant
grandeur, drama and sincerity. The
work contains huge variations in
colour and mood, and is highly
demanding for both the choir and
orchestra. The hushed mystical
tranqulity of the opening contrasts
with later whirls of sound, torrents of
brass and booms from the bass drum
evocative of the horrors of the final
Day of Judgement.
Verdi initially performed the work
in Milan with a choir of 120, but a
choir of 12,000 sang when he reached
the Albert Hall on tour in 1875. The
Requiem is shortly to return to South
Kensington in the proportions of the
original performance IC Choir with
a full orchestra will be bringing the
work to you in the Great Hall on
Friday March 18 at 8pm, so you can
judge it for yourselves. Tickets are
available from the Haldane Library,
from Choir members or on the door.
It'll certainly be a lively evening!
