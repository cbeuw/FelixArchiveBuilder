ELIX
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING
The Elec Eng Revue
M l
Questions: Which London show last
week attracted more ticket touts than
Les Miserables and Phantom put
together? Was it really true that some
Elec Eng Revue tickets were changing
hands at three or four times their face
value inspite of the efforts of Beit
security to break up the racketeering?
Well, that was as maybe—the fact
was that the Electrical Engineering
Department's Revue of 1988 was the
sort of occasion at which Fergie
herself would have wanted to be seen.
The anonymous undergraduates who
were willing to pay the exorbitant
ticket prices for this charity bash were
provided with food, drink, top class
variety and the chance to mingle with
anybody who is (was) anybody within
City & Guilds.
Dean, Head of Department and
academics sat helpless as shaft after
shaft of wit were played out at their
expense. After this irresponsible
outburst by members of staff and
student sketches were no more
complementary. Culture was
mercifully injected into the rowdy
proceedings by the talented staff
string quartet who added chamber
music to an evening of chamber-pot
humour. Even Duncan 'stand up'
Royle in his contribution stooped to
telling jokes about bewildered toads
and ejaculations.
A great time was Had by all and
many thanks must go to all the people
who helped set up and tidy up and to
the student and staff performers who
were pathetically brilliant.
DANCE CLUB
The result of the Dance Club's efforts
so far this term have been somewhat
varied due to the rather
'unpredictable' judging experienced
at the South Universities Ball.
Having said that, it has been an
exceptional year in terms of the
number of people competing for the
Club.
This upsurge in interest resulted in
the need for three teams, each having
four couples, many of them
newcomers this year, and puts the
Club in a strong position for the
coming year.
The National Students' Rock 'n'
Roll Competition was held at Imperial
this year and proved to be a very
successful event. Defending national
champions Neil McCluskey and
Dinah Woodhurst (Imperial College)
were 'dethroned' by Steve Mercer
and Nicky Stanmore, also from
Imperial College, who after hours of
dedicated practice, gave a very
convincing and in some place breath-
taking performance to take first place,
with Neil and Dinah coming second.
A few weeks later a full team
travelled up to Hull to take part in a
warm-up competition before the
Southern Universities Ball.
The evening belonged to Steve
Mercer and Nicky Stanmore who
were placed first in both the Jive and
Rock 'n' Roll competitions.
Newcomers to the Club Jason Woo
and Lily Saw came third in both the
Cha-Cha-Cha and Rock 'n' Roll
events but, unfortunately for the
Club, were unavailable on the night
of the Southern Ball.
An inspired performance by the
members of the B team who went into
the competition one couple short,
secured them the'B team trophy for
which many thanks must go to
Richard Seymour who provided a
FILMSOC
He's back!
Eddie Murphy is back as Axel Foley.
Quick to answer the call of his old
Beverly Hills buddies, Rosewood and
Taggart, he's up against Brigitte
Nielsen, illegal arms dealers and a
series of robberies known as 'The
Alphabet Crimes'. With music by
Bob Seger, Harold Faltermeyer and
many more, and shot at Playboy
Mansion West it's sure to be action
packed, so see you in Mech Eng 220
at 7pm on Thursday March 17. Only
£1 non-members, 50p members,
membership available.
AXEL FOLEY IS BACK.
BACK WHERE HE DOESNT BELONG.

calming influence over his partner's
emotional performance both on and
off the floor.
The stage was now set for the
Southern Universities Competition
being held at Cardiff. The final results
did not match those anticipated but a
high proportion of our couples made
it through the semi-finals.
Neil McCluskey and Dinah
Woodhurst had their revenge for the
previous week's results and danced to
first place in the Jive with David
Barker and Alice Jacques giving an
inspired performance to get a third
placing. In the Cha-Cha-Cha Thomas
Puetz and Joanne Wade, a new
partnership this year, came fourth and
also won the Newcomers Trophy for
this event though Joanne's artificial
fan gave the impression that she was
entering the final stages of some
tropical disease.
Special mention must go to Hugh
Hamilton and his partner Shuko
Noguch who beat both A and B team
couples into the semi-finals and also
won the Newcomers Trophy for the
Waltz.
The evening ended very well for
Imperial when they successfully
defended their Off-Beat title with a
thigh-slapping country and western
style performance to that Doris Day
classic 'Whip-Crack-Away'.
Thoughts now turn to the Inter
Varsity Ball being held at Liverpool
on March 12 and whether or not the
Off-Beat team can repeat their
winning performance and retain the
title for the second year running.
This report would be incomplete
without thanking Max Kallios and
Sartaz Ahmed who, with literally a
couple of hours tuition, completed the
C team Cha-Cha-Cha and managed to
get through to the second heat—could
this be the beginning of an invincible
partnership for next year and the start
of Max's infatuation with tight black
cat-suit bottoms?
