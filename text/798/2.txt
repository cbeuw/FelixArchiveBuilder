Did you ever have the feeling that
someone doesn't like you? This was
to have been a bumper twenty page
issue but more machinery
breakdowns in the Print Unit meant
that at the eleventh hour I had to
cannibalise everything and cut it
down to sixteen. Hopefully this will
mean that you are now reading this
copy of FELIX on a Friday, not
Monday, morning. I must apologise if
it's cramped but I wanted to squeeze
in as much as I could this week.
Next Issue...
...is in ten days time on Wednesday
March 23. It will be very large and
very interesting. All copy deadlines
remain the same. Just in case...
Heroes
Special thanks to Lloyd Ruddock and
David Jones who stayed up all night
Tuesday to print Wednesday's issue.
Also to Pippa Salmon and Kamala Sen
who also saw the night through with
me plus Mole and Chris Martin. The
FELIX spirit still lives on!
Baron to be killed off—official
Due to popular demand I have decided
to scrap The Baron. Next week's issue
will contain the last Baron ever, but
this will be one with a difference! It
will be written by one of you,
hopefully. Entries should be about
1000 words long and include your
name and department, although these
will not be published. The storyline
should be based on anything topical
concerning the Union, College or the
world in general. The names should
be easily decipherable and all entries
should reach me by next Wednesday.
I'll give a FELIX sweatshirt for the one
we publish

What a week! The elections have kept
a serious level of betting maintained;
Guildsheet slags me down for picking
three-legged donkeys; and the FELIX
Editor advises me which horse to
back (which incidentally, came in at
a very nice 11-4).
Anyway, next week will prove
even more hectic with one of the
highlights of the racing calendar—The
Cheltenham Festival. Regular
followers of this column will have a
fair idea of my recommended
selections but here's a swift preview:
The Gold Cup, March 17
Cavvies Clown has now been cleared
of all doping allegations by The
Jockey Club and is now free to run.
1984 winner, Burrough Hill Lad was
retired from racing last Saturday
night, so no winner for Penny Pitman
this year. This was much to the
annoyance of one FELIX candidate
in last week's election. He denies all
knowledge of backing it despite
tipping it three weeks previous. Only
a fortnight ago, Jenny Pitman was
quoted as saying, 'It's not a question
of whether or not he'll win, but by
how far'. Not far enough by the looks
of it.
Yahoo is looking good after his
convincing win on Saturday at
Haydock. Watching it on the box, I
was very impressed with his
performance and he could represent
a nice each-way shot at 20-1. Yahoo
Shan's
Racing
Column
only cost his owner 40,000gns and
may well emulate Alverton (1979) and
Royal Frolic (1976) by going on to
Gold Cup success after winning at
Haydock the weekend before.
Undeterred by all this, however, I
am going to stick with my old
favourite Playschool. Superstitious
readers may like to know that I was
looking for FELIX 750 which
contained an article on gambling. I
eventually found it. The headline?
Playschool. Back it.
Now, as promised in FELIX a
fortnight ago, I can now reveal my
main tip for the Festival next week
Daviil, Elseworth is re-running
Skevena after he finished third in
Folkestone in the middle of last
month. Keep your eyes peeled for this
nag's outing and back it heavily each
way. I will!
Finally, for all those interested in
going to Cheltenham next week, here
are the details:
A luxury coach leaves Victoria
terminus at 9am and leaves the
racecourse half an hour after the last
race. The fare is £10. All club badges
for the three days are sold out.
However, Tattersalls tickets are still
available for the first two days and
will be on sale on Gold Cup day from
(Lian^
T f l don't see you at the Festival,
have a good one. My selections for
this week are on the news page.
