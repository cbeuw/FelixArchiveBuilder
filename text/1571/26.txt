FOOTBALL
The Imperial Medics 2s FC are look-
ing like a formidable force this year
with great success coming in the BUCS
league so far and a great chance to fight
for promotion! The team has experi-
enced both highs and lows throughout
the season, however the team has really
come together in recent weeks and will
be going into Varsity with a rich vein of
form. With some massive games com-
ing in the run up to Varsity our prepa-
ration could not be better. The team is
showing their desire to really compete
at all levels and this is why I am sure
the medics will record a big win come
March 12th. A superb striking force, a
master class in midfield, a dogged de-
fence and a gallant goalkeeper is what
makes the Imperial Medics 2s FC a
great unit and with a great captain lead-
ing the team, come varsity it won’t be a
matter of if we will win, but more the
matter of by how much we will win!
The main priority for the team this
year was to secure survival in the new
BUCS league which we have just been
promoted into. We have surpassed this,
and are sitting comfortably in 2nd posi-
tion behind a very good Hertfordshire
1s team, with two matches to go. Our
LUSL campaign has had a few hiccups,
but began very well by thoroughly beat-
ing our Varsity opponents, the Medics,
5-0. Facing them again at the end of the
season is something we have all been
greatly looking forward to, and there
is no doubt in my mind that we will be
up for it and all over them from the first
whistle. Our prolific front three of Alex
‘Cravin’Dale’ Dale (10 goals, 8 assists),
James ‘Jimmy’ Murphy (14 goals, and
his goal mountain of 16 assists), and
myself (20 goals, 7 assists) smell blood.

2013/14 has been a season of transi-
tion for us, with the loss of several first
team players to injury and the stresses
of final year meaning we have found it
difficult to adapt to a higher level after
BUCS and LUSL promotion last sea-
son. However, despite this and a diffi-
cult run of fixtures before Christmas,
we are currently five games unbeaten
and are still in contention for survival
in both leagues coming into the run-in.
We also have high hopes of success in
UH and NAMS cup competition. Go-
ing into Varsity, we can’t ignore the fact
that we suffered the ignominy of a 5-0
defeat to IC 1s earlier in the season, but
this will only serve as added motivation
to gain revenge when it really counts on
Wednesday 12th.
A stellar season for ICUAFC 2nd XI has
led to a title charge in BUCS and a solid,
top half of the table performance in a
debut season in the LUSL premier di-
vision. Highlights of the season include
a goal from the halfway line, a 6 game
win-streak and an anthem of Scatman
that will stay with the squad for the rest
of their days. Lowlights involve jam jars,
spinal injuries and having to listen to
the perpetual moaning of IC’s veteran
striker. After trouncing IC Medic 1s 5-1
on their own patch, who knows what is
in store for IC Medic 2s at Fortress H?
One thing is for sure; they don’t want it
half as much as we do.

The ICUAFC 3s have gone from
strength to strength this season, an im-
pressive feat given that we are coming
off the back of promotion in both BUCS
and LUSL leagues. We have seen strong
additions from within the club and from
the new wave of freshers, including
Faidon Mitzalis, international man of
mystery and Francis ‘SBU’ Nwobu. The
business end of the season is set to be
an exciting one; we currently lie 1st in
BUCS and are well in contention for a
LUSL promotion.
Varsity will be the 3s’ only fixture ver-
sus any ICSM team this season. Having
initially played for the medics myself in
first year, victory will be all the sweeter
when it comes.
The seasons been completely differ-
ent for the 3s in our two leagues. On
Wednesdays the results haven’t been
as good as we would have liked, but
we’ve been fighting back in the past
few weeks, we’re looking to finish in the
top third of the table. On Saturdays we
have had a lot of success, we’re current-
ly sat at the top of our league and are
looking for some silverware.
At Varsity we’ll be looking to put last
year’s loss firmly behind us, and are
looking forward to a great day. We
have a really strong squad and lots of
determination, and I really believe that
ICSMFC 3s will be victorious on the
12th. Come on ICSM!

It’s been a mixed bag for the 4th team
this year. Whilst we are top of the league
and on a charge towards promotion in
our LUSL league, we have struggled to
adapt to our new BUCS league, with
long away trips and unknown, tricky

A mixed bag for the 4s this season. The
Saturday league has been running bet-
ter than the tough Wednesday league.
A lot of very good new teams joined
the Wednesday league, hence making
it a very competitive one. All the hard-
est games have been played and now
the weaker teams are left. Hopefully
a strong finish will ensure we can fin-
ish mid-table in both leagues, some-
thing which can realistically be done.
The United Hospitals cup (between
the London medical schools) has been
going well and we are now through to

good game should be had and maybe
the underdogs can come out on top.

always gone our way. The season cer-
tainly has had some fantastic highlights,
not to mention beating King’s 1s away
in the LUSL cup 3-0 and coming out
with a 4-3 victory in a dramatic game

to want to make amends for their 6-0
