FRIDAY 07 MAR
TELEVISION
Culture returns to the Idiots’ Lantern
Ryan Ehlers takes a ride in Stewart Lee’s Comedy Vehicle
I
am culture,” declares a delusional
and ranting Stewart Lee in the
final episode of the new series
of Comedy Vehicle, 30 minute
episodes of stand-up comedy.
He lists some admittedly impeccable
credentials: books published by
Faber and Faber(1)
(“not Tesco’s own
brand”), having co-written and
directed an award-winning opera(2)
,
having curated jazz festivals, and
performed John Cage pieces to paying
audiences. He does not count among
these credentials the BAFTA that the
second series of Comedy Vehicle won
in 2010 for Best Comedy Program(3)
.
This is perhaps unsurprising,
given that in previous series he has
denounced television as “the idiots’
lantern”, and Channel 4 as “like a flood
of sewage that comes unbidden into
your home”. He has not, he assures us,
seen Breaking Bad.
“I am culture,” and yet here he is,
snarling at us through our idiots’ lan-
terns once again. This tension between
his apparent high culture pretensions
and his low culture medium(4)
is one of
Lee’s favourite subjects, even when he
is not addressing it directly. His books
consist of transcripts of his stand-up
sets, carefully introduced and con-
textualised, and densely, ironically
annotated(5)
as if they were serious
literature. It’s a theme that American
comedians have been quick to pick up
on, though none are as thoughtful or
funny as Stewart Lee(6)
.
To this end, the first episode, which
aired last Saturday, was about “por-
nography, and the human imagina-
tion, and the internet, and all these
sorts of things.”(7)
Lee doesn’t take
long to start wheeling out his usual
tics. There’s a pre-prepared note,
imaginary phone conversations with
his hand, claims that he doesn’t really
know what he’s doing, pausing to al-
low the audience to guess a punch line
before he delivers it anyway, thematic
consistency unusual for a stand-up
show, and insistent repetitions (“I am
culture,” declares Stewart Lee). There
are hints that his idiosyncratic style
might finally be becoming wearing(8)
,
drained of its power to shock, but this
first episode is among the most ac-
cessible 30 minutes of stand-up he’s
done and these tics are still new for a
new audience. Somewhat brilliantly,
matching form with content – im-
agination – Lee closes with a routine
which requires us to imagine a second
voice he’s talking to on the phone, be-
fore fading away and inviting us to im-
agine Lee’s closing lines as well.
Lee’s other obsession is the status of
the stand-up comedian. For Lee, the
role of a good comic (or court jester)
is to remind the establishment how
ridiculous it is. How can a comic do
this effectively if they are not them-
selves a low-status figure?(9)
Stewart
Lee has now won a BAFTA, made
documentaries for Radio 4, writes for
The Sunday Times and The Guardian,
had books published by Faber and
Faber (“not Tesco’s own brand”), co-
written and directed an award-win-
ning opera, and curated jazz festivals,
and performed John Cage pieces to
paying audiences(10)
. He’s no longer a
low-status figure. He attempts to cut
himself down, and justify his ranting,
by beginning the series with the claim
that Lee Mack has attacked him as “a
cultural bully from the Oxbridge ma-
fia,” and supposedly he is merely re-
sponding to defend himself. On top of
this, the show is cut throughout with
claustrophobic shots of Chris Morris
(The Day Today, Brass Eye) interro-
gating and antagonising Lee, who is
visibly a broken man. Lee is in turn “a
charlatan”, “[like] the devil”, “like a mad
old pope”(11)
. For now, he continues to
just about get away with it.
“I am culture,” declares a delusional
and ranting Stewart Lee in the final
episode of the new series of Comedy
Vehicle. He’s probably not. He is fun-
ny though. It seems apt to paraphrase
Lee’s friend Simon Munnery. You can
watch everything else on television
and dismiss it as nonsense if you like.
You can dismiss it as nonsense with-
out watching it to save time if you pre-
fer. And that’s the route I’ve chosen.(12)
(Saturdays at 10 pm on BBC 2 until
5th April)
Footnotes
(1)
A publisher he shares with Samuel
Beckett, Ted Hughes, T.S. Eliot, Sylvia
Plath, Seamus Heaney, William Gold-
ing, Ezra Pound, James Joyce, and
W.H. Auden, among others.
(2)
For which some eccentric reli-
gious fundamentalists demanded he
should be tried for blasphemy.
(3)
Incidentally he might also have
mentioned documentaries made
for Radio 4, and his writing for The
Guardian and The Sunday Times.
(4)
A medium he shares with Ber-
nard Manning, Jim Davidson, Frankie
Boyle, and historical court jesters.
(5)
It looks a bit like this.
(6)
Bo Burnham captures it wonder-
fully in his song Art is Dead: “Have
you ever been to a birthday party for
children, and one of the children won’t
stop screaming? […] I am an artist.
Please don’t revere me… I am an art-
ist. You’re free to correct me… I’m just
a kid.”
(7)
Lee’s words.
(8)
This might be the point. At any
rate, I suspect Lee would approve of
this response, insistent that continued
repetition will make it funny again
later.
(9)
For Lee, the chief crime of Frankie
Boyle and Jimmy Carr is not that they
are offensive, but that they are bullies:
high-status figures applying pressure
downwards.
(10)
This repetition is more like Hom-
er than Stewart Lee, really. I’m trying
my best.
(11)
Presumably Lee’s rejection of the
internet is like a medieval pope’s re-
jection of mass-printed bibles in com-
mon languages.
(12)
Stewart Lee also used a version
of this joke, dismissing Russell Brand’s
book, in the first ever episode of Com-
edy Vehicle. Munnery is dismissing
the Bible, with the context that he’s on
stage as a character, and the character
is clearly insane. He walks on stage
in a red jumper apparently covered
in roses and opens with the immor-
tal words, “Good evening. I am the
Church of England.”
Few people could have escaped the
popularity of the Netflix political dra-
ma series House of Cards. However,
the US show is actually a remake of
a 1990s British TV miniseries of the
same name. While I have heard won-
derful things about the remake I have
always had somewhat of a fondness
for British television and have always
found the UK political system more
interesting than its American counter-
part. Therefore, it should be of no sur-
prise that I decided to devote the little
time that I had between lectures and
project work to watching the original
(though its length – just four hours
in total compared to the remake’s
thirteen hour long first season – was
probably also a contributory factor).
I must say that I wasn’t disappointed.
Set in a fictionalised version of the
aftermath of the resignation of Mar-
garet Thatcher as Prime Minister, the
show follows Francis Urquhart, the
Chief Whip of the Conservative Party
– responsible for maintaining disci-
pline on the back benches. After help-
ing his colleague Henry Collingridge
become leader of the Conservatives
and win the subsequent general elec-
tion, he expects a reward in the form
of a senior Secretary of State position.
However, when Collingridge reneges
on his promise and decides to leave his
Cabinet unchanged Urquhart vows re-
venge and begins scheming to become
Prime Minister himself. This sets off
a tense and densely plotted story as
Urquhart uses every dirty treat in the
book to unseat his opponent.
The focus of House of Cards is, of
course, Urquhart himself. He is fierce-
ly intelligent and absolutely ruthless.
Much of the fun of the show comes
from seeing how he manages to skil-
fully and subtly manipulate all of his
opponents into doing exactly what he
wants. His genius comes from doing
almost everything indirectly, from the
shadows, never admitting to anything.
His approach to politics is perfectly
summarised by his oft used line: “You
might think so, I couldn’t possibly
comment”. He appears to be so char-
ismatic and earnest, thanks in large
part due to a stunning performance by
Shakespearean actor Ian Richardson,
that even his greatest enemies believe
him to be their best friend.
Urquhart is also a great character
on a more personal level. At the start
he appears to be an ordinary, if ambi-
tious, upper class man. However, as
the show progresses we find out that
he has a darker core – he is utterly
self-centred and doesn’t care about
anyone who gets into his way. How-
ever, he never becomes an outright
villain. He is always a well-rounded
and nuanced character. Through the
writing, acting and the unusual tech-
nique of Urquhart often performing
asides to camera, we get a picture of
him as real life, three-dimensional hu-
man being.
This is an intelligent drama that
works on many levels. It has a tense
plot and is effective as both a politi-
cal thriller and an in-depth character
study – certainly something worth de-
voting four hours of your life to.
