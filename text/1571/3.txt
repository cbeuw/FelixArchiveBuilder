Imperial Student mines
Dogecoins
The Big Elections for 2014 have
started this week at Imperial College.
Campaigning started on Monday 3rd
March and will continue through till
the 14th March and voting opens next
week on Friday 7th March and will
last one week.
According to the ICU website, over
459 candidates are running. So even
though there are over 100 positions,
competition for certain positions
will be tight this year. The infamous
Union President position has seven
candidates running.

An Imperial student used College
computers to mine 30,000
Dogecoins. The Dogecoin, which
was first introduced three months
ago and is inspired by the popular
Doge meme, is one of a number of
cryptocurrencies set up following the
spectacular success of Bitcoin. Such
cryptocurrencies are not controlled
by a central bank but rather by a pre-
determined algorithm. Individuals
can donate some of their computer’s
processor time to running this
algorithm and managing transactions
performed using these currencies.
They are rewarded for this by being
awarded newly generated coins of that
currency – this process is referred to
as mining and is the only way in which
new Dogecoins and Bitcoins can be
produced.
Working late at night, the student
was able to use ordinary desktop
terminals to mine the Dogecoins.
He follows the example of a Harvard
Student who used their University’s
research supercomputer for
Dogecoin mining. The currency
has been growing in both value and
popularity – most notably having
been used to fundraise the money
to send the Jamaican bobsled team
to the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics.
However Dogecoins are not yet worth
anywhere near as much as Bitcoins –
the student’s efforts have only earned
him the equivalent of £20.
Speaking to CoinDesk reporter and
former Felix editor Kadhim Shubber
earlier this week the anonymous
student said that he decided to
use College computers rather than
buying a powerful computer because
he doesn’t “find the cryptocurrency
market stable enough to make real
investments, at least for now, on a
student budget”. He added that: “I’ve
not had a single issue yet, so I’ve kept
scaling up! It seems they don’t have
anything set up to bring attention to
the fact I’m maxing out the CPUs,
which is nice”.
However,byTuesdaytheschemewas
discovered by College ICT, resulting
in the student being permanently
banned from using the College’s more
powerful research supercomputers. In
a statement to The Tab Imperial, the
College said: “Use of the College’s IT
facilities for commercial purposes is
not permitted without authorisation.
Imperial investigates and takes
appropriate action against instances
of misuse, in line with information
policies. Occasional personal use of
College machines is permitted where
use does not disrupt the conduct of
College business or other users.”
Chess Team wins at
BUCA
Two weekends ago, Imperial College
London’s chess club fielded three
teams for the British University Chess
Association championship (BUCA),
coming away with two cases of
silverware.
The first team competed in the
open competition, where the real
title of British Chess Champion
was competed. Captained by James
Hookham, and including Alex
Galliano, Veronica Foisor as well as
Chess President Arijit Gupta ¬– the
team that had been seeded first –
was expected to retain the title that
they had won last year. However,
several hurdles stood in the way of
Imperial’s success. Over ten teams
were competing, including formidable
foes in Cambridge 1 and Edinburgh.
However, after playing five rounds,
all the worries of Imperial’s first
team were proven to be completely
unfounded, as a clean sheet of five wins
were secured leaving the Imperialites
with ten points out of a possible ten,
and thus confirming them as British
Chess Champions for the second year
running.
The Plate competition, which
included Imperial’s second and third
teams, was much less clear-cut. The
second team, seeded first in this
competition, consisted of first board
Wan Mohd Fahzli, second board Boey
Jin Huey, third board Shih Goh and
fourth board, captain Luke Barron.
Throughout the first few rounds, they
routed their opponents, however a
draw against main title contenders
Birmingham did not bode well for
the rest of the competition. However
even after that setback, they team
bounced back all the way to the
last game, which seemed have been
written in the stars, against Imperial’s
third team. The third team, lead by
Maximilian Eggl and fielding Alina
Mititelu, Nikolai Rozanov and Ioannis
Englezos, had traversed an easier path.
After losing against Birmingham in
their third game, they had gone from
strength to strength and won all their
consequent games. This led to the
game of the two Imperials being quite
significant in determining the final
position of the two teams. In a show of
selflessness, Imperial thirds lost their
game securing Imperial second’s win
in this competition, leaving them in
fifth position in the standings.
In addition to the team prizes, six
Imperial players won board prizes for
their outstanding play. These included
Nikolai Rozanov, Veronica Foisor
and Luke Barron. All in all, this was
quite a success for the Chess club, and
hopefully this can be repeated in next
year’s competition. Read more in Luke
Barron’s full report next week.

A
ccording to an article
in the Times Higher
Education, former
College lecturer Yeong-
Ah Soh has brought an
employment tribunal claim against
Imperial for the reasons of unfair
dismissal, racial discrimination
and suffering detriment for
whistleblowing.
The former materials lecturer
believes that she was fired due to
low student satisfaction scores she
received during feedback. When she
started at College in 2010 Dr. Soh
was allegedly told not to lower the
standard of her teaching, despite
negative student feedback.
According to the Times Higher
Education Dr Soh also claimed that
positive student satisfaction from
students were often related to students
expecting to receive strong marks in
examinations in that subject.
At the time of going to print, College
was unavailable for response.
