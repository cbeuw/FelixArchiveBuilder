RUGBY
The Imperial College 2nd XV had a
slow start this season but we’ve picked
up momentum just in time to smash
the medics come Varsity. We’re confi-
dent that with our star players: Charles
with his unbelievable kicking record
and our very dominant very English
back row Ruaridh, Eifion and... Matt
we will be able to nullify the medics,
providing that they actually turn up
to play Rugby this year. Captain Alex
Johnston has taken leading by exam-
ple to a new level this season by try-
ing his hand at every position possible
apart from Hooker, claiming that he
gets enough of that off the field. Alex
Clayton has turned into a command-
ing presence behind the scrum keep-
ing a close eye on Willy Jones in his
new position at second row. Hopefully
we’ll be seeing more Poon than just
Eugene in the Union after thrashing
the medic’s at Harlington – if ‘French
romantic’ Maxime actually passes
the ball. Let’s just say the medics will
be sorry they shut the A&E depart-
ment at Charing Cross come the 12th
March.

As IMRFC 2s, we have had a season
of mixed results but throughout have
played with ferocity, flare and finesse.
We currently sit mid table in the BUCS
league with some sub par performanc-
es before Christmas knocking us out
of promotion contention. Nonethe-
less, impressive form post Christmas
has seen us challenge the best in our
league, most notably a comprehen-
sive win against Middlesex 1s (current
leaders.) Over the past few weeks the
forward pack, lead by the likes of Tom
‘the friend zone’ Howe, Jamie ‘the bush’
Close and Dan ‘not so doughy’ Campi-
oni, have put together some top class
rugby, in particular some dominant set
piece. This puts the team in a strong po-
sition heading into Varsity.
We have also won through to the UH
cup final so hopefully by the end of
March we can have two new pieces of
silverware in our trophy cabinet!
So BUCS have seen fit to label the
medics 3s as ‘Imperial 5th’ and IC 3s
as ‘Imperial 6th’.
On the 12th March we will set the re-
cord straight.
Even after another horrendous blun-
der left us with no games nearly all
second term, our spirits are high.
Captain Luke Armitage is encourag-
ing cider for all so the 3s are motivat-
ed. Merlin the wizard has magically
fixed his disfigured finger, and pack
veterans Lombizzle and Cavallazzi
are out for a third straight varsity
win. With specialist number 8 Tim
Harrington hoping to control the
ball at the back, our scrums look sol-
id. In the backs we have the port con-
noisseur A. Leonard working with
recently converted flankers Fishy and
Christian, both out for blood. Darius
has recently returned from teaching
Mike Brown how to play full-back,
and with Henry Legge predicting a
fire about to burn, this is set to be an
unmissable encounter.

Imperial Medicals 3XV, arguably the
most competitive IMRFC team (albeit
in the lowest BUCS league in the South
East) have had a fantastic season so far.
Technically unbeaten, top of the league
and through to the semis of the BUCS
cup, we are approaching varsity this
year brimming with confidence, and are
hoping to be the first medics 3s team to
win varsity since 2010.
Led by an aging part time skipper, our
phenomenal form of late has certainly
been due to hard graft, and team effort.

3RD TEAM
Women’s rugby has had a great season
after promotion to BUCS SE1A. The
majority of LUSL matches are left to be
played but we remain confident we can
still win the league as we did last year.
As a club we are mixed with both med-
ics and IC and so for Varsity we split the
team in half and play 7’s or 10’s against
each other. Despite the fact that we
know one another very well our com-
petitive spirit always takes over and it is
a ﬁercely fought game. IC won for the
first time ever last year and is looking to
repeat this in 2014! This year’s Varsity
is set to be nail biter as the two of the
highest scorers, Kath Fok and Sammy
Gottardi, are medics whilst IC has the
best boot in the land belonging to Lana
Lee, and the French centre Carolanne
Vouriot who is not one to be messed
with.
