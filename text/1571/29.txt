Big Elections 2014
Hello there!I am Plabon, the current RCSU President.
During this year, I oversaw an increase in UROP
funding, helped depsocs to organize more events and
have made Science Challenge bigger with notable
guests at the launch. Previously, I was the RCSU
Treasurer and had jobs at the Union related to finance,
the bar and more visibly a brief stint as a union
model. This gives me a sound understanding of what
needs changing. I have had first-hand experiences of
standing up for students and making the changes you
want happen.
My policies if elected are:
-An online e-petition system designed to give more
power to the students
-Dedicated full time staff support for the Graduate
Students Union
-A review of UROP opportunities across faculties to
lobby for further funding and more placements
-Continue current work towards an insurance scheme
for international students so they won’t have to pay six
months’ rent upfront
-Oyster top-up service at the union
- Re-training provisions for all personal tutors
-Increased union revenue to go direct to clubs and
societies as further funding
-Further development for Reynolds with student
consultation and invest increased revenue into
ICSMSU.
-Extensive training for bar staff to cut down waiting
times at the barâ€¢ Use Metric a lot more. Look
to bring in local bands and offer more live music at an
affordable price.
-Develop loss making provisions at the union (eg
catering) and invest this back into students
Vote passion, progress and prowess. Vote Plabon.
Extended manifesto at www.voteplabon.co.uk
I have the experience, motivation and enthusiasm to
make your University work for you.
I want to make your time at Imperial as valuable as
possible. To achieve this, I want to focus on improving:
Satisfaction, Development and Inclusivity.
Who am I?
I have 3 years of experience working closely with the
Union during my Physics degree. I have been the
Chairman of Exploration Society, Social Secretary
of Mountaineering Club, and RCC Chairman of 48
clubs, (with a £350,000 turnover). I’ve also managed
a business, organised international expeditions and
raised thousands for charity.
To improve Satisfaction, I will:
-Create a confident, informed student voice that
enables us to question decisions we disagree with
-Engage with College to maximise the funding that
is available for students who want to undertake
Undergraduate-Research-Opportunities-Programmes-
Lobby departments to increase the quantity and
quality of feedback for exams and coursework
-Aim to meet student demand for work-experience/
internships/placements by utilizing the relationships
between departments and industries
-Ensure that we are properly consulted on all decisions
that affect us by pushing to implement a college-wide
consultation system
To encourage Development, I will:
-Push the Careers Service to provide more alternative
graduate opportunities (outside finance/consulting
sectors)
-Further existing relationships with other London
Unions to encourage more art, music and creative
collaborations on campus
To ensure Inclusivity, I will:
-Improve the support, visibility and recognition that
Overseas Clubs receive
