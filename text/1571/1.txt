“Keep the
Cat Free”

associated with the facebook page and
twitter account in question. A formal
investigation into these allegations has
been launched under the provisions
contained in the Union’s Bye Laws.
While this investigation is taking place
a suspension of activities has been
issued to the team in question.
The Union takes allegations of
this nature very seriously; we will
be acting quickly to establish facts
and explanations related to these
allegations.”
Looking at the evidence we have
gathered, Felix believes that the squad
is potentially in breach of BUCS
Regulation 17 article 1, which states:
“Every member institution and its
clubs shall be responsible for ensuring
that its players, officials and all persons
purporting to be its representatives
do not conduct themselves or print
/ have published any material which
will bring the company into disrepute
including social media platforms.”
We also believe that the further
scrutiny on the squad is due to
Union Bye-Law E, which deals with
“Bringing, or having the potential
to bring, the Union into disrepute”,
amongst other matters.
After we reported the allegations
to both the Union and ICHC, the
offending facebook group and twitter
account were removed (although a
text version of the twitter feed is still
available in the google cache).

Discovering Miso-gine-soc
Felix finds evidence implicating the Men’s Hockey XI 2’s
team in misogynistic behaviour online
T
his week Felix discovered
the existence of “GineSoc”,
the alter-ego of the Imperial
Men’s Hockey XI 2’s
team. After discovering
a certificate of “Gine” last week on
a table outside the FiveSixEight (a
bar located on Union premises), we
carried out further research. Our
investigations revealed the existence
of an “@ginesoc” twitter feed (now
removed), containing an explicit
avatar image and a mixture of tweets
to pornographic actresses as well
as tweets about hockey matches.
Included in the twitter feed were
an invitation for a porn actress to
visit Imperial College Union on a
Wednesday night if she “ever want[ed]
a good time in London” and a request
for a shout out from Select UK Radio
to “ginesoc hockey club, listening on
the way back home from a big 4-2 win”
Felix also found a closed Facebook
group called “ICHC Men’s Ginesoc
XI”, in which the group identified
themselves as “The glorious men’s 2’s”
and linked to a definition of “gine”
which states that gine means “sexual
relations with a girl”, which “comes
from the word Vagina” and “is a harsh
way of saying that someone wants to
have sexual relations with a girl”.
Felix spoke to the ICHC asking
them to explain why they felt it was
acceptable to publish the material
they they did on social media in a way
that potentially excludes the female
members of hockey. In response to
these allegations the Men’s XI 2’s
Team Captain Jack Farrant stated via
email, “ICHC is one of the largest
entirely mixed sports clubs at Imperial
and we pride ourselves in being one of
most friendly and inclusive societies”
Felix also spoke to the Union, who
released the following statement:
“The Union were made aware on
Thursday 6 March of allegations that
the IC Hockey Mens 2nd Team were
