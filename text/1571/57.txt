FRIDAY 07 MAR
HANGMAN
1907-2013 – Anonymous automatons
voted into varying roles for Imperial College
Union.
2002 – Switzerland narrowly votes to
join the UN. Most who voted against
were concerned that joining any sort of
organisation would contravene their sacred
vows of neutrality.
1999 – Paul Okalik was elected the first
Premier of Nunavut. Despite being elected
to an essentially dead-end backwater of
Canada, it is widely accepted that he was
one of the greatest leaders Canada had ever
seen.
1945 – In a move that is thought my most
historians to have ultimately swung the war,
Finland declares war on Germany.
1665 – King Charles II declares war on the
Netherlands. To be fair though, those Dutch
bastards had it coming.
1519 – In what was probably a Bad Thing,
Hernan Cortes arrives in Mexico.
1493 – Christopher Columbus arrives
back from his moronic trip in which he
consistently and stupidly mistook the West
Indies for the Far East. Hangman cannot
emphasise enough how much we feel
Columbus was a fucking idiot.

Student Carefully Considers All Candidates

ollowing the release this
week of the candidates’
manifestos, an Imperial
second year spent several
hours carefully analysing
the philosophies and stratagems
of the various nominees.
Looking over the promises and ideas

roles, the student painstakingly
A
puppet government,
nominally led
by ‘President’
David Goldsmith
has this week
called elections that amount
to little more than a PR sham.
Whilst power is technically supposed
to reside with the ‘elected’ President
and Deputy Presidents, it is a well-
known that de facto power really
lies with the evil Rector, Sir Keith
O’Nions AKA the Onion Knight.
Whilst it is thought that the day-
to-day running of the Democratic
Student’s Republic of ICU is left in
the hands of the puppets, it is well
known that all key decisions are
dictated by the Onion Knight. From
his office atop the Queen’s Tower,
the all-seeing Rector misses nothing.
Despite the UNs attempts to
supervise free and fair elections, it
assumed by most that the current
crop of candidates will represent
little more than new mouthpieces
for the despotic leadership residing
at the heart of the University.

ue to an unfortunate
set of circumstances
that took this editor out
of the country for 48
crucial hours, Hangman
was unable to cover the beginning of
the ‘Big’ ‘Elections’ ‘2014’. However,
do not fear, because this week we give
the full scoop in our Election Special.
We bring you in depth analysis
of where the power at Imperial
really lies. On top of that we have
the inside scoop on how you’ll
be voting as well as a insightful
and fascinating editorial piece.
Of course, first and foremost
Hangman must encourage you to
take the only noble course during
these elections is not to vote.
All the candidates are, frankly, terrible.
They are completely and utterly
incapable of even slightly fulfilling
the roles they’ve naively applied to.
By voting, you would achieve nothing
more than to show to the world what
an ignorant, gullible person you are.
This editor also urges you to fight
the hegemonic stranglehold of
Rector Sir Keith O’Nions. The
man’s unrelenting grasp on power
can and must be stopped. The only
reasonable way to do so is not to
participate in these so-called Big
Elections (see below for more detials).
So, throw away the campaign
leaflets, take up arms and storm
the Queen’s Tower, because
the revolution’s just begining.

At press time, many students

These could be any one of the previous ICU presidents
or Deputy Presidents. Seriously, even the weird skiing
machine from Wallace and Gromit’s ‘A Grand Day Out’
had more original and free thought than these guys.
