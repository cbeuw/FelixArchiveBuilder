I can’t see what I’m eating...
Plabon Saha went for a dining experience in the dark
I
have previously heard of a
restaurant where people dine in
the dark and are served by visually
impaired waiters. I never really
thought much of it, until the film
About Time when I decided this is
something I should try at least once.
So, I decided to take my girlfriend
out there on a date last month for
what turned out to be a truly unique
experience.
Unlike the well-lit areas of west
London that we are all used to, EC1
is not lit up just as well. Five minutes
from the tube station, there lay a dimly
lit restaurant off the main road. Once
you enter, you are told to put away
mobile phones and any other object
that produces any form of light. A tab
is opened up in your name and you
are shown to the upstairs bar to have a
drink and choose your menu.
The menu consists of four options:
‘Red’ for meat, ‘Blue’ for fish, ‘Green’
for veggie and ‘White’ is the chef’s
surprise. You don’t really know what
you are about to eat and those are the
only choices you have. For the price of
£51 for a three-course meal it’s pretty
steep, even by London standards. The
tab opened for you at the start lulls
you into a false sense of security and
it’s easy to lose track of how much you
are spending.
After waiting a few more minutes,
we are informed that our table is ready
and are shown downstairs and through
some heavy curtains to find a corridor.
The corridor is lit only by a couple of
dim red lights. We, alongside another
couple are told to wait in line with
our right arm on the shoulder of the
person in front. We met our waitress
for the night who would be guiding us
into the dining area and looking after
us throughout the night. We went
through a couple more sets of heavy
curtains and voilà! Pitch black. All I
could hear was the deafening sound of
conversations and laughter that made
me feel like I was in the middle of a
bustling market.
I stumbled across the darkness,
moving slowly and holding on to the
waitress for dear life until my hand
was placed on a chair. I was told this
was my seat and once I sat down, I
realised that I had lost my bearings
and had no idea where the table was.
Some shuffling followed before I
realised that I was facing the side of
the table and had been feeling up the
arm of the person sitting next to me.
As I turned towards my table, the first
thing I realised was the strain on my
eyes as they got used to the darkness.
I can’t recall the last time I was in the
dark like this. I put my hand in front
of my face and I was unable to make
out its shape – there was not a speck
of light in the near vicinity.
With sight diminished, your other
senses are heightened. You are more
in tune with the noise around you,
trying to make sense of it all. I tried
to put a face to the voices I heard,
but it’s very hard to tell much about a
person from just hearing them speak.
The atmosphere is also a lot friendlier
than usual. You find yourself easily
involved in conversations around you
as the barrier between strangers is
suddenly lifted. There is no way for
you to judge their reaction or read
their body language, and you don’t
have to behave in a certain way either.
It also paves the way for people being
slightly more rude than usual, as the
woman sitting next to me cracked a
crude joke for the whole table.
Once the food arrived, eating was a
lot more complicated than usual. At
times, it’s hard to find the food on the
plate and you are often left wondering
whether you have finished your meal.
Someone from our table actually gave
up cutlery and resorted to eating with
their hands. Taste-wise, the meal was
as good as any. A lot of guesswork is
involved trying to figure out what
exactly you are eating. I am told things
such as vegetables often taste delicious
if you don’t know you are eating them;
while the duck pieces I ate hardly
tasted like duck. When we looked at
the menu after we had finished eating,
the only thing it seems I successfully
guessed was the beef steak. But then
again, I thought I was having beef all
the way through.
Once we had finished eating and
were led out from the dark room, the
dimly lit red corridor seemed so much
brighter than I remembered. I had to
stay in the corridor for a good five
minutes before I dared to venture into
the lounge. I have never appreciated
the power of sight more than that
moment.
The bill was slightly steep for the
meal, I must admit. However, it
should not be seen as just a meal in a
restaurant. It is more of an experience
– much like theme parks. Once you
take that into account, and you know
that this is something to do once in
a while, things are not as bad as it
seems. There are also information
points in the restaurant which seek to
explain the high cost. The company
gets no subsidy from any government
for hiring the visually impaired and a
small portion of the cost of your meal
danslenoir.com
goes to charity. Furthermore, they
require a lot more staff than a normal
restaurant due to health and safety
issues. It is great that they are able to
give the disabled jobs, and the unique
experience offered is certainly worth
being a talking point for many.

Well, okay, by that we meant
pancakes. It was Shrove Tuesday
this week and if you missed out,
here is a quick and simple recipe
to make one over the weekend and
it would be a great social occasion
for the house/flat/your friends!
To make around 12-14
pancakes, you will need: 110g
plain flour; 2 eggs; 200ml milk;
75ml water and 50g of butter.
Sifttheflourintoalargemixingbowl
and add a pinch of salt. Then, make a
well in the centre of the flour and break
the eggs into it. Whisk the eggs until it
is all mixed and make sure you do not
leave any lumps of flour in the mix.
Add a small amount of milk and
water mixture, gradually, whilst

Melt the butter in the pan, then

whisk. Pour the rest of the butter

The exterior of the restuarant, in broad daylight
into a bowl and use it to lubricate
the pan with some kitchen towels.
Get the pan really hot, then turn
the heat down to medium and do a
tester for size. Normally a ladle is just
right for a normal sized pan. Pour the
batter in and it only takes around a
minute to cook, then use your ninja
skills to flip the pancake, or use a
spatula if you are feeling less brave.
The other side should only need a
few seconds and it is ready to eat!
Traditionally you would have the
pancake with lemon juice and a
sprinkle of sugar, but, to be honest,
you can put whatever you want
on them. From cheese and bacon
to bolognese; from ice cream to
nutella! Perhaps you could try
banana, crispy bacon and syrup!
