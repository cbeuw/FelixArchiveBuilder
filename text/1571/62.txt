Devils take Varsity Victory
against UCL
The Imperial Devils retain their Lon-
don Ice Varsity crown in a thrilling 5-4
shootout victory over the UCL Yetis.
Spurred on by a rousing cheerlead-
ing performance from the IC Titans in
front of a 600 strong crowd, the tone
of the game was set only 50 seconds
in, as Devils Gus Zimmerman rocked
a UCL player bearing down on goal
only for it to be deemed tripping. The
Devils’ penalty kill was set to work
and was impressive throughout the
game, valiantly denying the Yetis any
powerplay goals throughout the game
including a five on three advantage for
UCL at one point during the third pe-
riod.
The Devils opened the scoring only
moments later when Ryan Ritchie
latched onto a pass from Max Fink
and leathered a shot past the hapless
Yeti keeper. The Yetis were looking for
an immediate response and the Dev-
ils found themselves under siege with
goalie Stefan Nubert making several
exceptional saves to keep the Devils in
front. The Yetis did find their equal-
iser after picking up a rebound but the
Devils responded in kind only a min-
ute later with Ryan Heaton picking up
a long pass and slotting home on the
breakaway, giving the Devils a 2-1 lead
after the first period.
After a cagey start to the second pe-
riod, the Yetis restored parity as their
star defenceman managed to find an
extra gear and slip past a few checks
to score. Tensions were notched up a
scale as neither side wanted to give up
any opportunities and several big hits
from both sides riled up both teams.
This culminated with the UCL Yetis
captain challenging Ryan Ritchie to a
fight, which was quickly settled with a
single jab to the nose (check it out on
Youtube!) sending the UCL player hit-
ting the ice faster than Tim Runcorn
can strawpedo beers at the AGM.
Pushing to score late in the second
period with a man advantage, an un-
fortunate break allowed the Yetis to
capitalise and come into the final pe-
riod with a 2-3 lead.
UCL quickly found themselves a
man down after a Yetis player retali-
ated after being on the receiving end
of a hit from Angus Coleman. The un-
disciplined Yetis were made to pay af-
ter Ryan Heaton banked in a rebound
on the powerplay. With the Devils
garnering momentum, the Yetis could
only attempt to halt the constant
waves of attack by illegally taking out
Devils players. The Devils cashed in
on the powerplay once again to take
the lead as Ryan Heaton completed

IC ICE HOCKEY
IC stroll past LSE
It was a typically busy
Saturday morning at South
Kensington station as the 4th
team gathered for their journey
to #FortressBerrylands, eager to
prove their worth against top-
of-the-league LSE 4s. In one of
the tightest LUSL Division 2 title
races seen in decades – only two
points separated the top 4 – this
was a must win for both teams
concerned. But it was particularly
important for us, since we had
played at least a game more
than our main rivals, LSE 4s and
LSE 2s (no offence QM 2s). Our
plight wasn’t helped by a certain
Frenchman, Sofiane Hamadi, who
decided to arrive 30 minutes late
to the station, eating into precious
warm up/banana consumption
time. Despite this fashionably late
attitude from Sofiane he would
later repay his debts by scoring a
fantastic early goal. After being
slipped in by the on-form Fogo
‘The Enigma’ Adelowo with a
sumptuous through ball behind
their bewildered left back, Sofiane
took one touch out of his feet before
sweeping the ball emphatically into
the bottom left corner. 1-0 IC 4s.
Despite our strong start, some
nerves kicked in and the league
leaders inevitably responded from
their sluggish opening. Our faith in
the world renowned ICUAFC tiki-
taka style was coming back to bite
us as the sticky Berrylands pitch
and a couple of sloppy touches led
to losing possession in dangerous
areas and conceding silly fouls. A
devilish delivery from a set piece
led to an equaliser being bundled
in by their 6’6+ centre half. 1-1.
The momentum appeared to
have shifted in the game. But
a scintillating breakaway only
minutes after the equaliser, led
by Canadian import Daniel
Gregory’s perfectly timed over
the top through ball (LB+Y) to
Alex Craving-Dale, who broke the
opposition’s frankly appalling and
ill-judged offside trap to be clean
through. Craving-Dale flicked the
ball over the keeper and casually
side-footed it into the back of the
net.
Our front four continued to
use their pace and intelligence to
cause plenty of problems to the
LSE backline, who resorted to dirty
tactics such as blasting the ball
into Gregory’s stomach, winding
him badly. In fact it was only a few
minutes after his winding that the
irrepressible Gregory managed to
score our third to put us 3-1 up.
Confidence was high and after
some intricate play in the midfield

Craving-Dale was released down
the flank, Gregory struck it with
his weaker right foot on the volley,
producing a stunning Van Basten-
esque shot into the top right corner.
3-1, three quality goals. We went
into half time on a high.
The second half produced a less
frantic opening but exchanges were
still tense. The next goal was all-
important and both teams knew it.
We continued to create openings
and the ball somehow managed to
not go in after a point blank header
from Adelowo was saved on the line
by their keeper. Despite many fierce
claims that it had indeed crossed
the line, Fogo was unable to add to
his 19 goal tally. Vicious rumours
are that Fogo is planning to write a
letter to BUCS demanding goal-line
technology be implemented into
every game, such is his thirst for
fantasy points.
The key goal finally came after
an inspired double substitution
by yours truly, bringing on Josh
Parsi and Josep Melé for the last
15 minutes. The fresh legs made an
immediate impact, as Josh lofted the
ball towards Josep, who cushioned
the ball with his instep before
looping an acrobatic volley into the
top corner. Game over.
Craving-Dale added one more to
his tally, assisted by Josep, to put the
game truly to bed. To their credit,
they fought to the end and had a late
penalty appeal turned down. Other
than that, the game turned into more
of a training match. Sam ‘Edin Dzeko’
Duffield went on a mesmerising
run down the left wing, beating
(according to him) 12 players before
selflessly cutting the ball back but to
no avail. Even I made my own burst
from centre back, getting on the end
of a Dale cross only to head just over.
It could have been eight or nine, but
we had to settle for five as the final
whistle went. Only two more to go in
our charge for promotion.
INSIDE: Imperial 1st XI thump
UCL
ICUAFC is sponsored by:
his hat-trick after creating space with
some nifty stick handling moves. With
the game seemingly reaching its con-
clusion, agonisingly the Yetis mus-
tered a response with 2 minutes left
to take the game into overtime. Both
sides exchanged chances but with no
breakthrough, the game was to be de-
cided in a shootout. Ryan Heaton con-
verted to give the Devils the advantage
only for the Yetis player to even the
stakes with a slapshot. After two more
attempts, Max Fink pulled an incred-
ible move, sending the Yeti keeper to
the ice with a fake shot before slotting
in an open net. Stefan Nubert then ce-
mented his credentials as man of the
match as he stoned the Yeti shooter
to crown Imperial as the London Ice
Varsity 2014 champions.
