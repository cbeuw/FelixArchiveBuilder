This week life continues as nor-
mal, you escape the election
fever and manage to hide in
your research group, or so you
think... as you walk out for your
Fuel lunchtime snack, you’re
accosted by an armed, orange
t-shirt wearing Sabbatical of-
ficer. You die an honourable
death.
This week it’s still election
week, you haven’t voted and
you’ve started to receive
stalkery messages from the
Union. “Please vote!” they
cry, “we’re still desperate to
beat St. Andrews!”
This week it’s election week.
As you steel yourself for a
week of being harassed by
people who normally blank
you in the library, you’re ac-
costed by a desperate can-
didate - your money or your
vote? Well what’s money
worth these days?
This week you are an incum-
bent in a elected position. As
you read the manifestos of next
year’s victims you laugh, for all
they say they claim to make
things better, you know they’re
only in it for a tankard!
This week you decide to actu-
ally emerge from the library,
only to be accosted by orange
t-shirt wearing lunatics with big
smiles and carrying a ipad. As
you prepare your escape plan
you trip over a loose book and
smash your head on your key-
board. You voted RON for ev-
erything.
This week you wish it was last
year, when RON was a Klin-
gon. Never before have you
been so fatally attracted to
RON’s crested eyebrows or
his penchant for gothic fash-
ion. This week you’re forced
to do horoscopes because
the Editor thinks you have a
sense of humour. Wasn’t that
a mistake? You deiced to use
This week you experience
some shameless self promo-
tion. As you accept the flyers
and sweet from the strang-
ers your parents warned you
about you find yourself plotting
to take over the Union by force
and reinstate pitchers at the
bar! Huzzah!
This week you decide to run for
Union President. Except it’s too
late, nominations have already
begun. You resign yourself to
wait until next year, besides, it
will be easier the right?
This week you’re forced to do
horoscopes because the Edi-
tor thinks you have a sense
of humour. Wasn’t that a mis-
take? You choose to use the
time to ask people to send in
horoscopes to hangman in-
stead, let the people decide!
This week you stay up until
6am doing a pullout for Felix.
You send the paper off to the
printers, only to find that you’ve
printed the pages in the wrong
order. Still it makes for a rather
amusing read.
This week you take excep-
tion to the front page story. On
principle you take a proposal
to the New Clubs Commit-
tee asking to form a new club
actually called “GineSoc”.
However, due to your illegible
handrwiting they reject you
and tell you they already have
a cinematic society.
This week, you just wanna live.
In desperation you turn to twit-
ter to try to feel feel as though
you’re a apart of the cool
crowd. Mistakenly you follow
the #voteicu hastag and de-
generate into a useless dribble
of memery. At least you can
slowly become more of a Union
hack than you already are!

“War Will Not Descend Into
War” Claims War-Mongering
Man
H
angman can confirm
that this week, as with
all weeks of the year,
there will be several
forms of team sports
occurring.
It has been generally assumed
that the superior teams with
better players will win, however
it’s entirely possible this may not
occur at all for a variety of reasons.
Sources confirm that there is a
strong chance that, as well as the
huge amount of team sport being
played, there should be a significant
amount of individuals sports to be
played. Again, it is highly suspected
that the better individuals will win,
though this is far from certain.
Putin Assures World
T
he crises in the Ukraine
reached a peak this week
with the invasion of
the Crimea by Russian
forces, however, Russian
President, Vladimir Putin has moved
to assure the World that the war
would not degrade further into war.
“No one wants this conflict to
develop into less than me” stated
the President from an unnamed
Russia Air Base near Volgograd.
“In fact, it would be an international
disaster if this invasion of foreign
territory was to become a full-scale
invasion” continued the President as
he pulled on his camo gear and slipped
a pistol into the holster on his belt.
“And whilst certainly the political
situation in Kiev is not ideal for us
right now, we would never move more
troops and military equipment into
the lands of our valued friends and
neighbours” Added Putin as he slung
a round of ammo across his shoulder
and reached for his crash helmet.
“Anyway I wish you would stop
pestering me on the purpose
and activity of our troops in the
Crimea” the President said as
he climbed into the cockpit of
his Sukhoi PAK FA fighter jet.
“I mean history quite clearly shows
that neither Russia, nor any other
European countries have any interest
whatsoever in the Crimea” the former
Prime Minister concluded before
closingupthecockpit,slidingdownhis
helmet and getting cleared for take-off.
