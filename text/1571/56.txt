Ask Annie, your friendly Agony Aunt
Help! I recently came out to my friends
as bisexual, but no one believes me,
and says that it’s just a stepping stone
on the way to coming out as gay. I
shouldn’t have to justify my attraction
to both genders, how do I stop people
questioning my sexuality?
Not confused in North Greenwich
Pretty much, just tell them to fuck
off. Your sexuality is none of anyone’s
business, and you definitely shouldn’t
have to justify it. Once you’ve told
them, no one has any right to question
it, and no good friends would. Of
course, it’s alright for people to be
curious about this new thing that
you’ve told them, and they may have
questions, but if they’re questioning
the validity of your orientation, they’re
not the sort of people you want to
associate with.
Help! I accidentally sent a dick pic to
my ex-girlfriend. The only problem is
that we ended on really bad terms and
we have a lot of mutual friends, and
I’m worried about what she might do.
How can I deal with this?
Embarrassed in Euston
You need to get on damage control
straight away if you’re worried. The
first thing you do should be send her
a message and apologise. Don’t try
and justify it by saying that it was an
accident and you meant to send it
to someone else, just apologise for
causing any offense. You have to be
prepared for the possibility that she’ll
tell people, but sending dick pics is
pretty normal these days, you don’t
need to be very embarrassed. Try and
downplay it, apologise, and hopefully
it’ll blow over.
Help! I can’t stop gaming, and I realise
that I haven’t done any work this term,
I’ve even stopped going to lectures.
I don’t know how to stop, and I don’t
know how to get back into working
again, even if I manage to. Where do
I start?
Addicted in Acton Central
The first thing you should do is
prioritise getting back into lectures.
Even if you’re behind and confused, as
soon as you get back and start taking
notes, other bits will follow. Try and
limit the amount you’re gaming; make
sure you’re not letting it encroach on
uni life (this does still allow plenty
of time for gaming!). Once you’ve
managed that, ask your friends for
their notes that you’ve missed, and
try to start going through them a bit
at a time. Don’t try and do everything
at once, or you’ll get overwhelmed,
but there’s still plenty of time to pull
this back. Just set yourself limits on
gaming and stick to them – have your
flatmates enforce it if they have to!
Good luck!
Help! I really want my girlfriend to
stick a finger up my arse when she goes
down on me. How do I bring this up?!
Curious in Camden Town
If you’re in a stable and healthy
relationship, you should be able to
ask for something that you enjoy
without making them feel like they’re
forced into doing something they’re
uncomfortable with. If you feel like
this is something that you can’t ask
your significant other, you might want
to re-evaluate your relationship. On a
side note, in the interest of safety, make
sure that you use a condom (which
might encourage your girlfriend too)!
Help! The girl I’m seeing has suddenly
started ignoring me. We used to be in
constant contact, texting all the time,
but recently she’s just stopped replying.
I can see that she’s read my messages,
but she doesn’t reply, and only contacts
me when she wants something. Is she
just stringing me along?
Strung along in Shoreditch
Honestly, she probably is. She’s
probably trying to keep her options
open with you, but doesn’t actually
want to date you. You should make
an offer to meet up, something very
open that she won’t refuse if she’s
interested. If she says no, she probably
isn’t looking to stay with you, and you
should act accordingly.
On Sunday, the first of (hopefully) many Lonely Hearts
couples went on their first ever date. Our lovely lady (to
be identified by her red coat) met our extremely generous
respondent just ahead of a showing of The Lego Movie, who
not only bought the tickets, but also bought the popcorn as
he initially promised. What a gentleman!
Upon meeting, conversation between them immediately
flowed, with plenty of laughter from both sides. During the
film, conversation was restricted, but immediately picked
up again as the credits rolled. Our enchanting couple
found plenty to talk about, encouraged the other to try new
things, and found good company in one another.
Ultimately, however, despite enjoying the date, there was
no romance, with both sides deciding that they were very
different people. Both found it a really enjoyable experience
and would happily go on other dates in hope of finding the
right person, so anyone who thinks these sound like the
sort of people who you think you could get on with, send
Annie an email and she’ll set you up.
We’ve had a lull in Lonely Hearts, so if you’re
interested in going on a blind date, please send
in a message, nothing makes Annie happier
than matchmaking. These are real, this isn’t a
troll!
