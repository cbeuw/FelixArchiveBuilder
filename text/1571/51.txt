A
t some point last
week, news hit that
Facebook had acquired
perhaps the most
ubiquitous form
of communication today:
WhatsApp for £16
billion. It goes without
saying that social
network users both
on Facebook and
Twitter shared their
‘in-depth’ insights
(ramblings) on the
elaborate purchase,
thoughts ranging
from rational (how will
Facebook monetize
WhatsApp?) to the
downright, well, put
politely, irrational, ( i t ’ s
the end of the world as we know it).
It is an interesting situation worth
pondering however, why would
Facebook, home to over 1 billion
users buy WhatsApp?
To begin with, Facebook spotted
an opportunity to get into mobile
and with its deep pockets made an
acquisition that is difficult to fault.
They had initially tried to release HTC
phones with a Facebook interface,
which tanked spectacularly. Clearly
not an easy market to
c o m p e t e
in (see Google’s
purchase of Motorola), Facebook
simply did what most established
entitiesdo, buythesmallercompetitor.
Google had done the same when it
tried to compete with YouTube and
wound up buying the video streaming
website. So point number one,
Facebook has apparently succeeded in
expanding its business portfolio to the
mobile communication platform.
The chat feature on Facebook has
become a diminished feature of the
social networking site as users
opted for private messaging.
That problem has been
rectified somewhat
by the integration
of the messaging
and chat feature,
however, the
chat feature
r e m a i n s
s w i t c h e d
off by many
of its users.
W h a t s a p p
on the other
hand provides
an instant, user
friendly platform
amassing users all over the
world of close to 500 million
users. Through this acquisition, the
fight for which messaging platform
is of preference to the public has
been extinguished, and Facebook
effectively has decisively established
an additional avenue through which
to serve its users.
Finally, statistics show that mobile
phones share more photos through

he fledgling cryptocurrency
Bitcoin suffered one of its
biggest setbacks this past
week when the (formerly)
largest exchange Mt. Gox
filed for bankruptcy protection.
The beleaguered exchange has been
marred by a string of management
problems before it filed for
bankruptcy protection. Yet, the
currency has been relatively stable
amidst all of these: after briefly
falling to US Dollars (USD) 400 per
Bitcoin after the news broke, it has
now recovered up to a steady state of
around USD 650 at press time.
Decentralisation is at the core of
Bitcoins through the clever use of
cryptography. There is no central
authority to prove, or disprove that
Bitcoins are “owned” by anyone in
particular. There is a distributed
public ledger, known as the
“blockchain” that keeps a log of all
the transactions that have ever taken
place between Bitcoin addresses. In
order to “spend” the coins, one has
halted all trading activities. It
cited a problem with “transaction
malleability”, a known issue with
the Bitcoin protocol, as a reason for
doing so, and hinted that it had lost
money to this problem. This was not
a catastrophic problem because if
the software were written properly,
they would be able to safeguard
against this problem as many other
Bitcoin exchanges have done so.
Nevertheless, Mt Gox cited this as
a reason, and hinted that they have
lost a significant amount of their
money. Finally, on February 24, Mt
Gox shut down without a word and
filed for bankruptcy protection soon
after.
“cooling off”, always blaming some
glitch or another. Customers were
complaining for weeks long waiting
for withdrawals, with some allegedly
never completing. Mt. Gox was also
having to face several legal issues
with the US government. It was
during this time that other exchanges
begin to spring up and become more
prominent due to the various issues
facing Mt Gox.
On February 7 2014, Mt. Gox
Yong Wen Chua, on the dangers of trusting an online currency
Right away, the various exchanges
issued a joint statement saying that
the problems at Mt Gox do not
represent a problem with the Bitcoin
community at large. Bitcoin is not
centralised at Mt Gox, and the fall
of a player, albeit a big one, does not
spell the doom of Bitcoin. This sense
of optimism seem to be shared by the
community. After falling rapidly on
the day Mt Gox shut down, the price
of Bitcoin quickly rose and stabilised
at a value higher than before Mt Gox
shut down.
Perhaps the old adage of having
any publicity is good publicity rings
true as Bitcoin turns a new page in
its history.
WhatsApp with FB?

to prove ownership of the coins via
the use of private keys associated
with public Bitcoin addresses. In
other words, with the blockchain,
it is possible to trace how Bitcoins
have exchanged hands, and calculate
exactly how many coins a certain
address has in its possession.
There are generally two ways
to obtain Bitcoins: mining or
exchanging with some fiat money.
Mt. Gox was one of these exchanges.
For some time, Mt. Gox was one of
the largest exchanges where people
could turn their USD into Bitcoins.
But according to some leaked
documents and insider information,
the company was very badly managed
and some claim that the writing was
on the wall for it to collapse.
Mt Gox suffered a series of
setbacks along its way. The first
setback that Mt Gox suffered was in
late 2011 when it suffered a breach
to one of the textbook attacks: SQL
injection. Throughout 2013, Mt Gox
would periodically shut down for

These days you cannot help but encounter Apple or oe of its products
in your average life. Even if you don’t own a product, your friends will.
Therefore avoiding interacting with the fruity company has just gotten a
bit harder. Apple just recently announced CarPlay, a system with which
you can connect your iOS device to your car. However, at the moment
this is only available in Ferrari, Mercedes and Volvo cars. Apple does
plan to release this feature with BMW, Nissan, Kia just to mention a few.
Therefore if you buy a car in the future, you might hear Siri’s sweet, sweet
voice from your car’s stereo.
General news from around the tech world, so you can keep up
to date with the newest, weirdest and most futuristic things

WhatsApp than on Facebook, a key
activity that has made Facebook so
popular over the years. Probably
more importantly is the fact that this
activity is occurring in developing
countries, where the app has grown
immensely in popularity. Facebook
have therefore seen an opportunity
to expand into those regions in a bid
to “make the world more open and
connected”.
Just days after the acquisition,
WhatsApp had an outage for 3
consecutive days, not necessarily
a great start to the partnership
which will see WhatsApp remain
independent, but certainly not the
end of the world….is it?
Facebook on spending spree
After the WhatsApp acquisition (which you can read all about in the
brilliant article by Tola Makanjuola), most of us would have a well
deserved, and perhaps guilty, rest. Mark Zuckerberg doesn’t seem to want
a rest. To further his Internet.org initiative, Facebook is now going after
drone manufacturer Titan Aerospace for a purported 60 million dollars.
These drones then would fly over internet starved regions, beaming
internet (among them surely Facebook) to potential users below.
