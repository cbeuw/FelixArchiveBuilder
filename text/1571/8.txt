Breakthrough in HIV gene therapy

F
or the first time ever,
researchers have succeeded
in making enzymes target
andalterthegenesofimmune
cells that are susceptible to
HIV infection. A clinical trial tested
the enzymes, known as ‘zinc-finger
nucleases’ and found that they were
able to disrupt the gene CCR5, which
codes a protein essential for HIV entry
into T cells.
Although the clinical trial was only
based on around 12 volunteers, it is a
promising advancement in developing
suitable HIV treatment.
Results showed that disruptions
in the CCR5 gene allowed for a
significant elevation of T cells in
the volunteers’ blood, indicating a
decrease in the rate of successful
HIV infection. Furthermore, upon
half of the volunteers halting their
antiretroviral drug therapy, their HIV
levels increased more slowly than
expected.
With the presence of HIV, the T
cells containing the modified gene
proliferated more rapidly – it seems
HIV actually contributed to its own
downfall.
Those who carry a mutation in the
gene naturally are already resistant to
HIV infection; in 2008 it was reported
that patient Timothy Ray Brown was
free from HIV after receiving donor
bone-marrow stem cells that already
boasted the disrupted versions of the
gene. Unfortunately the provision of
donor bone-marrow stem cells is not
an option for many people who are
infected with HIV, as the body is very
likely to attack the donor cells.
Unfortunately the HIV soon
reappeared in Brown, delivering
a sobering blow to the research
T
he Public Library of Science,
the open access publisher of
the largest scientific journal
in the world, PLoS One, has
announced that from the
3rd of March, authors of an article in
any of their seven journals must make
all data related to the manuscript
publicly available immediately upon
publication.
While many have welcomed this
policy, others are concerned that it
could be difficult to implement and
dissuade people from publishing in
PLoS journals.
Open access to results has been a
driving force behind the development
and growth of PLoS, and the new open
data policy is a natural continuation
of that. PLoS hope that sharing of
data will encourage collaborations
and make it easier for old data to be
obtained by relieving the burden on
the scientists. They also believe it
will permit validation and replication
of results by third parties, as well
as merging of data-sets to give new
insights, which would not have
been possible with only summary
data. Advocates of open access have
praised the policy, with Dan Gezelter
of OpenScience.org stating that the
policy makes PLoS “a much more
attractive place to send our next
paper”.
In many fields, such as genomics,
submission of data to online
repositories is already commonplace.
Ian Dworkin, a geneticist at Michigan
State University, has benefitted in the
past from data sharing and believes
the policy will allow other scientists
to “address interesting and novel
questions in the future” using the
archived data.
However, not everyone has greeted
the news so happily. Many authors
are concerned about the size of the
data, which PLoS states must be
supplied in its raw form before any
processing. The raw data produced
when sequencing a human genome
can easily be over 300 GB, meaning
authors could have to make terabytes
of data available. Exactly how this
will be achieved is not clear, but the
problem will also apply to many other
fields handling large volumes of data.
Others are also concerned about
data privacy. Some data may also not
be released ethically, such as data
relating to individual patients, or
legally, if obtained from a third party.
In these cases, PLoS requires the data
to be available upon request, but not
necessarily made public.
In addition, many groups use
the same data to produce multiple
papers, each investigating the data in
a different way. By making the data
publicly available after publishing a
single paper, other groups will be able
to use it, potentially being ‘scooped’ to
an interesting finding. Writing on her
blog, neuroscientist Erin McKiernan
describes how in many cases, “data
acquired are like gold”, particularly
community at the time. However, with
this “gene-editing” technique, it seems
that things are looking up again.
One participant in the study was
lucky enough not to have the virus
return at all during the entirety of the
12-week period during which the anti-
viral therapy was paused.
Upon genome analysis, it was
revealed that this participant
actually already had one of the CCR5
mutations. Once the genes were
modified, over half of the T cells in his
body were resistant to HIV. “Nature
had done half of the job,” says Pablo
Tebas, one of the immunologists
leading the team at the University of
Pennsylvania, where the study took
place.
The next stage is to wean people
off antiviral drugs altogether when
undergoing the gene disruption
treatment, and it seems that this
could be a possibility. Other research
groups are using the same group of
enzymes to alter gene sequences in
haematopoietic stem cells, which
could potentially allow patients to
make their own HIV resistant cells
indefinitely.
Not only that, newer enzymes may
actually be able to replace DNA as
opposed to disrupting it, and these
could be used to help treat a multiple
of aliments from sickle cell anaemia
through to cancer. Could enzymes
truly be the ultimate editors? Only
time ­
– and a lot of research – will tell.

in labs with less funding, meaning
releasing their data could decrease
the amount of mileage they are able to
get from a data set, impacting future
funding opportunities.
This new policy is a brave step
along the path to open science, and
only time will tell how it impacts
PLoS journals, authors, and the wider
scientific community.
