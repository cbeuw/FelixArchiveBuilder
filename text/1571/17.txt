FRIDAY 07 MAR
BOOKS
Maciej Matuszewski talks about the the groundbreaking debut
science fiction novel by Ann Leckie
Ancillary Justice, the debut novel of
Ann Leckie, is one of those novels
that had been recommended to me by
pretty much everyone. However, as is
often the case, my other commitments,
and my impressively long reading list,
made me put off picking up for quite
a while. Now, having finally read it,
I realise that I should have heeded
my friends’ advice and checked it out
sooner because Ancillary Justice is
truly one the best books that I have
read in recent years.
The novel is set in the distant future,
with humanity having spread across
the stars – much of it ruled by the
militaristic Radch Empire. Its leader,
Anaander Mianaai, simultaneously
occupies countless different bodies,
giving her near immortality and
allowing her to micromanage all
of the many different star systems
she controls. Mianaai exerts her
will through her massive fleet of
AI controlled starships. The largest
of these each house thousands of
ancillaries – bodies of former enemies
of the empire who have had their
personalities erased and are now
controlled by the ships’ AIs and used
as soldiers.
Our protagonist is one of those
ancillaries, containing the last
remnants of the now destroyed AI of
the ship The Justice of Toren. Taking
on the name Breq she vows to take
revenge on the person responsible
for her ship’s destruction – Anaader
Mianaai herself.
This is a set up that presents many
different possibilities and Leckie
certainly doesn’t disappoint. The
plot is fast paced and well developed,
with exciting action and imaginative
settings. However, the wider themes
that the novel explores are its real
strength. We see how fear and self-
interest perpetuates the brutality of
the Radch Empire, despite most of its
citizens being ordinary, reasonable
people. We see how an atmosphere
of hopelessness and repression can
maintain a rigidly divided class system
that helps no one. And we see how a
3,000 year old AI can develop into
something far more human than
anyone expected.
In the hands of a lesser writer, putting
all these elements together would have
resulted in a confused mess. Leckie,
however, makes them all fit perfectly
together – they all build on each other,
and add to the central plot.
The focus of the novel is, of course,
The Justice of Toren herself. The
story is told in first person from her
perspective, which really helps us to
understand her. Over the course of
the book her character is slowly and
subtly developed as we learn how
the weight of thousands of years of
experience turned her from a simple
fighting machine into someone far
more complex.
Another interesting aspect of the
book is that Radchaai society has no
concept of gender, and indeed many
citizens of the Empire find it difficult
to recognise gender in other societies.
Thismeansthat,inTheJusticeofToren’s
first person narration, every character
is referred to by feminine pronouns.
For most of the characters we never
find out if they are biologically male or
female and for other, such as Anaader
Mianaai and her many bodies, we
know explicitly that such distinctions
are meaningless. This is a fascinating
and innovative technique that really
makes the reader question their
preconceptions about gender roles and
stereotypes.
All in all, this is a great book. I was
hooked from the very first chapter and
I sincerely recommend it to you all.
