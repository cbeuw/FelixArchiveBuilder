Interviews with the Captains
Sports Editor Kunal Wagle catches up with the two captains to get their
thoughts and opinions ahead of the flagship game on Varsity Day.
VERNON MCGEOGH
1ST Team Captain
How has your season been so far?
The season has been mixed. It
started off in September, moved on
through Christmas and ended up in
March.
How much does this game mean
to you?
It’s a really important stepping stone
before the UH final.
How does it feel to be playing at
The Stoop?
Well, it isn’t quite Teddington is it?
Where will this game be won and
lost?
The Stoop.
What is your prediction for the
game?
A game of two halves that will be
decided after 80 minutes.
The Captain’s Message:
This year has been a mixed one so far
for the Imperial Medicals 1st XV. The
beginning of the year was tough due to
arunofinjuriesandhavingtointegrate
a large amount of new members into
the team. However, since Christmas,
the injured have returned and under
the increased competition for places
the squad has thrived. This has led
to a large group of players all capable
of putting in a shift and a great team
atmosphere. Consequently, results
have improved and we are looking
forward to continuing this good run
of form into Varsity and the UH Cup.
MICHAEL O’CONNELL
1ST Team Captain
How has your season been so far?
The IC 1st XV started the season
with the goals of promotion, a similar
cup campaign to last year and to win
Varsity. Unfortunately St Bart’s have
dominated the league, we are the
only team to have managed at least a
draw against them with Bart’s winning
their other eleven matches. A very
comfortable win over the Medics
at the start of the season also puts a
shine on the year. Our cup campaign
came to an end with a 1 point loss
to St Marys after a very impressive
performance.
How much does this game mean
to you?
The success or failure of our season
rests on winning this game, it is
hugely important for the team and
the motivation to win is incredibly
high. We have been targeting this
game from the start of the season and
although we have been trying to say
that it is just another game it is naïve
to think that the boys wont be more
pumped up than usual for this one.
How does it feel to be playing at
The Stoop?
I was injured in my second year so
last year was the first time I was able to
play at the Stoop. It was an awesome
experience. It is also important not
to overstate the importance of the
stadium, people have been known to
get overawed by the occasion and not
to perform on the day.
Where will this game be won and
lost?
There is a saying in rugby that
says the forwards decide who wins
the game and the backs decide by
how much. I believe in this and on
Wednesday the team that wins will
be the team that can dominate the set
piece and the breakdown. Without
these key victories no team can gain
any momentum and it is very difficult
to win the game.
What is your prediction for the
game?
A spirited medic performance but
IC will have too much for them over
the 80 minutes.
