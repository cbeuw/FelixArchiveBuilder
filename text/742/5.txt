Even Dumber
There are many classic
procedural puzzles like this
one, usually to do with various
animals and people crossing
rivers. The best way to solve
them is to write on little pieces
of paper and shuffle them
around. This was the solution
I got in eleven moves:
1) Dumbest down, stone up.
2) Stone down.
3) Dumder down, stone and
dumbest up.
4) Stone down.
5) Dumbest down, stone up.
6) Dumb and stone down,
dumb and dumbest up.
7-11) Repeat steps 1-5.
The only correct entry was
from S Denye, Chem Eng 3.
Well done, as usual, you can
collect your prize from the
FELIX office after 1.00pm
Monday.
Puzzles of this sort were a
favourite of Lewis Carroll who
suggested an even harder
version of the above involving
animals to be lowered that
have to be held. I may try
setting one like that later.
There will be no Megabrain
next week but I'll be back for
an end of term special, for
which all submissions would
be gratefully received (to
Megabrain c/o FELIX Office).
All Union Clubs and Societies
