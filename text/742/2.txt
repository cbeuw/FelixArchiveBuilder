£ f c There are only two FELIXs left until the end of term.
?5 That means if you want to get any opinion articles,
JJJJ letters, articles on your clubs etc you've only got two
mmm more chances before the end of term. Take the
%0 opportunity to tell the students of Imperial College
H what's bothering you. Letters and opinions.should be
in by 1.30pm on Monday for next Friday's issue and
1.30pm on the final Monday for the last issue of term.
Reports
In the light of c o m m e n t s
made to me last week I
thought that I'd better
justify the editorial on the
A G M . T h e aim of the
editorial was not to criticise
Carl B u r g e s s , Dave
Kingston or Pete Wilson for
expressing their views. I
can hardly criticise people
for that w h e n I write an
editorial ever week. M y
c o m m e n t s were aimed at
the w h i m s of a few U n i o n
politicos. T h i s essentially
means that if cuts are to be
made, its the clubs,
societies and C C U s w h o
have to be cut. T h e U n i o n
has no policy on what
criteria s h o u l d be used to
make these cuts. For the
last two years transport has
been picked upon as an
easy target. W h e n you cut
transport no club is seen to
be savaged so each of the '
means other c l u b s close.
T h e U n i o n can not be
expected to support every
club. If the U n i o n
attempted to support every
club I could form a S p a c e
Shuttle C l u b and expect
the U n i o n to support my
club's attempt to build a
S p a c e Shuttle.
U G C
M a n y Imperial Departments
will be relieved by the news
they've been marked as
outstanding by the U G C .
M a n y parents around the
country must be
c o n s i d e r i n g trying to
persuade their children to
go to Imperial as a result of
this boost to ICs image.
Unfortunatley what few of
these parents realise is that
the ratings include no
assessment of the
undergraduate course.
Research at IC may well be
wonderful but it doesn't
mean that IC runs g o o d
undergraduate c o u r s e s .
G o o d researchers are not
necessarily g o o d teachers.
IC has made real efforts
(through the
Undergraduate Studies
C o m m i t t e e as m u c h as
anything else) to improve
teaching at IC. I hope that
the U G C marks won't result
in Undergraduate Studies
C o m m i t t e e work being
ignored.
T h e recent report of the
U S C is o n e of the most
sensible d o c u m e n t s to have
been p r o d u c e d at IC in
years. It has made s o m e
excellent r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s
that if adopted, s h o u l d
result in real improvements
in the undergraduate
courses. I hope that
departments don't rest on
their laurels but take the
report to heart.

Union Cuts
For the third year in a row
U n i o n F i n a n c e C o m m i t t e e
has been forced to s c r a p e
around to find over £10000
to cut off the budgets of
the clubs, societies and
C C U s . This problem s e e m s
likely o c c u r next year. T h e
p r o b l e m is that the U n i o n
has very few well defined
financial priorities. It is
generally a c c e p t e d that
office costs (primarily staff
wages) can not be cut as
these are fixed by C o l l e g e
and not subject to
negotiton bewteen the
U n i o n and its staff. T h i s
obviously is the correct
thing to do since the
permanent staff's pay
s h o u l d not be subject to
and get a grant to fly into space.
Major S u b C o m m i t t e e
C h a i r m e n can go away and
teli their clubs that they've
been saved. In practise
t h o u g h these cuts in
transport have severely hit
the sports and recreational
clubs. Sports c l u b s like
rugby and recreational
clubs like mountaineering
require their m e m b e r s to
s p e n d most w e e k e n d s
persuing their activities.
T h e cut in transport
funding mean that they
also require their m e m b e r s
to spend a large amount of
money persuing their
interests. In the near future
o n e of these clubs that
requires its m e m b e r s to
s p e n d large amounts on
transport may c l o s e
b e c a u s e of the cuts. T h e n
all the recent fine w o r d s
saying that the U n i o n
s h o u l d try a n d support
every club will be seen a
worthless.
I believe that U F C s h o u l d
not be afraid of prioritising
certain clubs even if it
Undergraduate
Studies Defended
Dear Sir
T h e first two paragraphs of
M r J Martin Taylor's report
as A c a d e m i c Affairs Officer
make an unwarranted
attack on the c o n d u c t of
the Undergraduate Studies
C o m m i t t e e , and the
preparation of its first
annual report. He alleges
that publication of the
Committee's report was
delayed so that its
c o n c l u s i o n s c o u l d be
'watered-down so as to
stand any c h a n c e of being
a c c e p t e d by the B o a r d of
Studies'.
Three student m e m b e r s
were present at the last
meeting of the C o m m i t t e e .
T h e final form of the report
was agreed by the
Committee without any
dissent (apart from small
drafting points w h i c h they
agreed to delegate to me).
T h e report has been sent to
all H e a d s of Departments,
S e n i o r Tutors and Directors
of Undergraduate Studies.
It has been issued now to
allow about a month for
d i s c u s s i o n before the
B o a r d of Studies c o n s i d e r
it. A n y member of the
committee will confirm that
not unauthorised c h a n g e s
have been made.
There is no foundation
for the statement about
watering d o w n the report.
There is no o c c a s i o n for
any of the complaints in
the s e c o n d paragraph ('it's
the s a m e old
story...Academics are still
too stuck in their
comfortable ways to make
any hard decisions about
the future of higher
education').
