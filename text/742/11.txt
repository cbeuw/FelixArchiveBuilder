A Sideways
Look
Saturday in August, the van is
loaded up and driven along
the M1 on its way to Scotland.
Meanwhile, the Exec and the
staff, the people who have to
build the theatre out of an
empty church hall crowd onto
trains and coaches to meet
again, early on Sunday
morning. When they finally
arive, tired and hungry, there
are just four days left to
construct both auditoria.
Archaic verse...to
modern farce
Originally the hall is just a
long empty room, with a pile
of chairs in one corner. Into
this space is built a
scaffolding structure to hold
up all the lanterns to light the
stage. The chairs themselves
are taken and nailed down to
rostra to give three raked tiers
of seats.
Meanwhile, for the
Cornerstone, a lighting rig is
devised which can be erected
in les than an hour each night
after the cafe closes. Direction
boards are constructed and
painted so that people can
find the venues which are
tucked behind the Church
building itself.
Work eventually finishes on
Thursday with the first of the
technical rehearsals and the
fire inspection. Before any
audiences can be allowed in, a
licence has to be obtained
which requires that the teatre
obeys all the fire regulations.
The main problem is that the
fire officers have another 150
or so venues to inspect in just
a couple of days. It is quite
remarkable how such a small
department can cope with the
enormous workload.
After all this, shows can
begin to be performed at TWE.
In all, 26 shows will be staged
this year, the same as 1985's
total, ranging from the archaic
verse of Samuel Taylor
Coleridge's 'Rime of the
Ancient Mariner'to the
modern farce of Dario Fo's
'Accidental Death of an
Anarchist'. Most, especially in
the first week, will be
subjected to the almost
arbitrary hands of reviewers
hauled in by the Scotsman,
the largest daily north of the
border, and Radio Forth,
together with cameo
appearances from Time Out
and City Limits.
Eventually, with the end of
August, the festival grinds to a
halt, and Theatre West End
must be emptied in less than
half the time it took to build,
often with far fewer than the
set-up â€” the 'strike', as it is
known, is far less glamorous.
The hall is cleared out and
cleaned up, ticket money
allocated to the sub-lets and
the long process of tidying up
all the accounts begins; all
ready for the next year.
(Warning: the opinions
expressed herein are not
necessarily those of the
FELIX Editor or of the

detract, however, from the
possible veracity of the
arguments put forward).
At this time of year,
abounding, as I'm sure
nobody needs reminding,
with exams, a strange
process takes place. While
waiting outside exam
rooms you meet people
you've never seen before.
No, that's not quite
accurate. They may have
been glimpsed in the front
rows of lectures, or found
in libraries late at night
pouring over problem
sheets and coursework, but
they hardly have a high
profile within department,
hall or club. They might be
T H E RATIO...
So now, with some
constructive action being
taken on The Ratio by
College, Department and
Union alike, will the future
be rosy, with a more
involved Union and a better
social life for everyone,
including these faceless
workers? As far as the
social life goes, yes, things
will definitely get better,
but there will be side
effects. The effect the
Rector hopes to produce
by increasing the male:to
female ratio is to reduce
the amount of beer-swilling
debauchery that happens at
the moment. This will
almost certainly happen,
and IC's bad reputation will
decrease. However, there
will be other effects. When
these newly involved

members of one or two
clubs, usually departmental
clubs like M O P S O C or
Chem Eng Soc, or societies
like Wellsoc that demand
no heavy commitments, but
they never spend more
than one night a week
away from work. You find
the same people ensconsed
in their rooms, if you ever
have the misfortune to take
a questionnaire around a
Hall of Residence, sitting at
their desk beavering away.
Yes, these are the people,
frequently described as
boring and apathetic, who
form an underlying and
ubiquitous foundation to
the departments of IC. The
tradgedy of it is that
however much they get
slagged off by the rest of
us for failing to take
advantage of the unique
facilities available during
their time at College, they
all do well, get excellent
degrees through hard work,
and find good, if boring,
jobs after. And what do the
questionnaires taken round
to these people show?
They slag IC off for
providing a lousy social
life. The reason they
suggest for the bad social
life? That much vaunted
and discussed item:
people are socialising, for
example, they will not be
doing the work they would
be without the improved
social atmosphere.
As a result of this their
grades will suffer, worse
degrees will be acquired,
and the good part of the
College's reputation will
decrease as well.
Is this all so much errant
twaddle put together to
bring a little needless
complexity into your lives,
< or is there some possible
evidence for this? The little
evidence I do have is that
single sex schools seem in
many cases to do better
academically than co-
educational establishments
(this is particularly true of
girls schools), and that the
single sex Oxbridge
Colleges do have excellent
academic records. (Philby,
Burgess and Maclean
though came from one of
these as well). Pretty weak
evidence I know, but who
can tell? Perhaps a better
signature for this article
would be a Cassandra, the
Trojan seer whose
prophecies, though
accurate, nobody ever
believed. I will sign
otherwise, however.
