The Week In Science
Time Out Meets Tomorrow's World
Skills In Action
The City and Guilds of London Institute has an exhibition
entitled Skills In Action at the Science Museum, running
until 1 June.
City and Guilds, as well as its involvement with IC, also
provides curricula, examinations and qualifications to set
standards of knowledge and skills for trainees in jobs in
industry, commerce and the public services. City and
Guilds courses and certificates cover technologies from
agriculture, catering, construction, electrical and
electronic, mechanical and maintenance engineering, to
vehicle and many other personal and scientific services.
The exhibition at the Science Museum aims to
demonstrate the range of industrial skills and technologies
on offer from C & G .
Starting o n the ground
floor, the exhibition kicks
off with a massive bank of
buttons to press, a paradise
for s c h o o l c h i l d r e n . T h e
buttons activate a c o m p u t e r
screen, w h i c h gives
information about the
c o u r s e s a n d qualifications
that C & G offers. A l s o o n
the ground floor is a
Prestel simulation
containing the 60 pages of
teletext that C & G h a s
maintained for over three
years. T h e s e frames have
been stacked o n c o m p u t e r
disc, s o the possibility of
s c h o o l k i d s , or IC students,
running up massive
S c i e n c e M u s e u m telephone
bils is eliminated.
Pick up a guide at the
ground floor stand, a n d this
will lead y o u to the first
floor exhibits. First are an
industrial lathe, a n d a desk-
top robot, being operated
by students from the
C r a w l e y Training
Association. T h e seven-axis
robot, called Neptune 2, is
controlled by a B B C
c o m p u t e r with a
c o n n e c t i o n to the parallel
interface. T h i s enables the
robot to be addressed a s if
it is part of the c o m p u t e r
memory. Each axis of the
robot is controlled through
a rack-and-pinion system
by double hydraulic
cylinders containing water.
C o m p l e m e n t a r y to Neptune
2 is a s c a l e d - d o w n
simulator, used for
teaching. Users c a n guide
the robot a r m , a n d
movements are recorded
digitally by the computer.
T h e industrial applications
are in paint-spraying a n d
spot welding, but the
s c a l e d - d o w n version is
s h o w n packing eggs into
cartons.
Next is a video recorder
assembly a n d repair
demonstration.
Representatives from

machines.
Weaving doesn't s o u n d a
very modern or high-tech
activity, but it is a very
orderly craft, w h i c h lends
itself well to numerical
control by computer. A s
e a c h weft thread is woven
it must g o over a n d under
the warp a c c o r d i n g to the
designer's plan. T h e
instructions to g o over a n d
under c a n be held in a
c o m p u t e r memory, freeing
the designer from the
tedium of the present
manual method. In the
demonstration, weavers
from the L o n d o n C o l l e g e of
Furniture make up d e s i g n s
on the screen of a B B C
micro, a n d then sample
them as clothâ€”the micro
controls the shafts o n the
l o o m for e a c h pass of the
thread. D e s i g n s c a n be
c h a n g e d at the push of a
button a n d , o n c e the*
designer has it right, the
program c a n be sent to
high-speed l o o m s for full-
scale production.
O n the s e c o n d floor, the
major attraction is the
electronic c o m p o s i t i o n a n d
laser printing display by the
Rank Xerox information
t e c h n o l o g y centre. T h e
workstation c o m b i n e s
wordprocessor, typesetter
and graphic layout artist,
claims Rank. D o c u m e n t s
are created o n a d o u b l e -
page, high-resolution
screen controlled by
keyboard a n d a m o u s e ^ a
pointing device that allows
the user to move a point o n
the screen to pull d o w n
menus, draw figures, s h a d e
areas, etc. T h e workstation
The Neptune 2 in action
is c o n n e c t e d to a laser
printer, c a p a b l e of
p r o d u c i n g 12 pages a
minute, with a resolution of
90,000 points to the square
inch. Demonstrating the
system are students from
the Rank X e r o x information
t e c h n o l o g y centre in
S l o u g h , where 16-18 year
olds o n Y o u t h Training
S c h e m e s a n d disabled
adults acquire IT Skills,
leading to a C & G
qualifications.
Skills in action runs until 1

at the S c i e n c e M u s e u m ,
o p e n 10am to 5 p m M d n d a y
