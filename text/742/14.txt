meeting.
Well done to all those who
passed their grading on
Wednesday—we'll try to
arrange for all those who
require belts to get them
before the end of term.
Paul Potter (Vice-Captain
of ICKC-2nd KYU) and
Jeremy Hague (Treasurer
of ICKC-3rd KYU) have
been asked to accompany
Imperial's instructor,
Caesar Andrews (3rd Dan),
to Barbados this summer in
order to train with and
compete against the
Barbados Shotokan Karate
Team in the run up to the
Pan American Karate
Games (To be held in
Trinidad in early July). This
is the second time that
Senei Andrews, born in
nearby Grenada, has been
asked to teach in Barbados.
Training will be hard, 3
times a day in
Temperatures around 83
degrees in the shade, and
the competition even
harder (some medals are
expected to won by the
team in the games). The
two students are eagerly
awaiting a reply from
'Fighting Arts
International'—A well
known martial arts
magazine—for which they
hope to be able to write an
article on their experiences
in Barbados. It is hoped
that such exposure will
attract some sponsorsphip
for the trip—some
assistance has already
been offered in the way of
reduced air-fares from
Sensei Andrews' sponsors,
Transatlantic Wings.
Sensei Andrews has
lately been celebrating the
production of his
performance of the Kata
'unsu' on Video, and the
request from Pan books to
write a book on Karate. We
wish him every success
with these ventures.
Cycling
New Officers
Last Friday saw Cycling
Club's A G M . We all met at
Southside at 7.30, and then

Semic, the following were
elected for next years
officers.
Captain Matthew
Whitaker, Vice Captain
Steve Turtle, Treasurer
Peter Hartigan, Secretary
Martin Bell, FELIX Officer

Mike Colclough.
A few members of
Cycling Club were busy
racing last weekend Scott
Heyhoe and Peter Hartigan
raced in the Blackmore
Criterium in Essex last
Monday, whilst last
Saturday Wayne Morley
produced a time of 1-6-40
in the Middlesex R C 25
mile T T at Newbury.
HANDBOOK
One of the first contacts
you had with Imperial
College after you knew
you'd be coming here was
the Imperial College Union
Handbook. This publication
is produced over the
Summer vacation by the
elected editor on behalf of
the Union and sent to all
the incoming students. It
aims to introduce them to
the Union, College and the
local area and act as a
reference book for the
whole duration of the their
degree.
Next year's Handbook is
being compilled at the
moment and we need your
help in producing a new
restaurant and pub guide.
Just write the information
needed below on a piece of
paper and post it in the box
provided just inside the
FELIX office in Beit Quad.
All contributors get a free
copy of the finished
magazine and a lucky draw
of all the entries will take
place with a prize of £5.
