Nightline Credits
Dear H u g h ,
I noticed that Nightline was
, mentioned in the U n i o n
A n n u a l Reports. T h i s year
has been a hard one for
Nightline in that I have had
to constantly c a m p a i g n to
secure its future. T h i s
battle has n o w been w o n ,
as the main s c h o o l s of
L o n d o n University have
agreed to contribute to
Nightline at a rate of 30
p e n c e per student. T h i s
c a m p a i g n w o u l d not have
been possible without the
support w h i c h we received
from the administration of
Imperial C o l l e g e over the
past year, a n d I w o u l d like
to take this opportunity to
thank them. I w o u l d also
like to thank Pete W i l s o n
i for the active support that
[| he has given me this year,
h a n d I c o m m e n d him for the
I e n t h u s i a s m w h i c h he
! brought to the post of
: Welfare Officer.
Nightline has-been saved

I remember that if they

, Dear H u g h ,
j B e i n g a student residing at
S i l w o o d Park I a m very
j rarely up at S o u t h
Kensington. A s with most
S i l w o o d residents I have a
s e n s e of detachment a n d
s o m e t i m e s c o m p l e t e
isolation from the events
and h a p p e n i n g s up there.
However your F E L I X
publications have m a d e up
j for this by being an
excellent s o u r c e of
information on the activities
of the C o l l e g e , U n i o n or
otherwise.
I do not think the paper
has been 'filled with
i n c o m p r e h e n s i b l e and
\ esoteric articles'. Indeed a
I great deal of them have
li been interesting a n d
I' worthwhile to read a n d
1 your editorials have been
1 cleverly written a n d to the
| point. I w o u l d therefore like
1 to congratulate and thank
| y o u for y o u r first rate
|| efforts this year a n d hope
y o u or your s u c c e s o r
carries on the g o o d work.
Yours

ps I hope a great many
students have responded to
the vindictive criticism
levelled at y o u a n d others
by the sabbaticals. Even if
the A G M passes the report
I think it would be a sad
loss if y o u were to resign
from y o u r position.

Dear H u g h ,
I was not surprised by the
results of the e m e r g e n c y
U F C o n Friday, where a
general and rather untidy
trimming p r o c e s s was
applied a c r o s s the board,
rather than o n e or two high
s p e n d i n g c l u b s being
d i s b a n d e d . N o b o d y w o u l d
want to d i s b a n d c l u b s a n d
s u c h action is always easy
to c o n d e m n , but difficult to
support. G e n e r a l c u t b a c k s
bring their o w n problems,
though, a n d all c l u b s have
suffered s u c h cuts over the
past few years. T h e
p r o b l e m we have n o w is
that most of the dead w o o d
has been removed, a n d any
further cuts will curtail
many c l u b s ' activities. It is
time that C o l l e g e realised
that having a strong and
' well funded U n i o n with a
large range of activities is
almost as important a draw
for students as having
g o o d , relevant a n d
interesting c o u r s e s , or
having a more normal male
to female ratio. T h e new
Rector has started to act on
the latter problems, he
must now d o s o m e t h i n g
about U n i o n funding, or the
strains from lack of f u n d i n g
will severely d a m a g e the
U n i o n structure. Indeed
s o m e of the strife seen
within the U n i o n this year
may well be due to the
o p p o s i n g factions fighting
e a c h other for more money,
with the E x e c caught in the
middle in an i m p o s s i b l e
postion.
T h e r e are two other
things w h i c h may be d o n e
by the U n i o n to ease the
situation. Firstly, it c a n
make obtaining
s p o n s o r s h i p by c l u b s a
worthwhile activity, a n d
s e c o n d l y something s h o u l d
be d o n e about the
ridiculous s p e n d i n g sprees
that the M S C ' s are
e n c o u r a g e d to indulge in
as a result of unspent
m o n e y reverting to the
U n i o n at the end of e a c h
year. A s we stand at the
moment, if a club can gain
s p o n s o r s h i p , that m o n e y
will be removed from their
grant, s o that the U n i o n
a n d not the c l u b benefits.
T h e problem with this is
that those working for a
c l u b see the time spent
looking for m o n e y a s
wasted s i n c e they d o not
financially benefit in the
e n d . A more equitable
situation, helping all
involved, w o u l d be to take
only half the f u n d s raised
from a club's grant, so that
both U n i o n and club are
better off. A s for the
c l a w b a c k of funds, again
s o m e divison of the m o n e y
left over would act to
reward those w h o have
saved m o n e y rather than
penalise them as n o w
o c c u r s . T h e arrangements
for this w o u l d have to be
carefully tailored to the
n e e d s of the particular
M S C ' s , since A C C has
rather different
arrangements to S C C for
e x a m p l e . T h i s p r o c e s s
w o u l d not be easy to work
out, but w o u l d bring about
more e n c o u r a g e m e n t s to
save money. I would
therefore suggest that next
year's e x e c think deeply
about s u c h matters over
the s u m m e r , a n d , hopefully,
be able to propose s o m e
plan at the start of next
year that is more
reasonable than the current
situation. It s h o u l d also be
made clear to C o l l e g e that
the U n i o n is not a b o d y
w h o s e funds can be cut
indefinitely without s o m e
serious repercussions for
the rest of IC.
