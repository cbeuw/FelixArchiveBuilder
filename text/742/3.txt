positive and constructive
co-operation between
students and staff in
addressing themselves to
the extremely difficult
problems of undergraduate
teaching in the 1980's. We
have written a report which
may be considered radical,
but which points towards
some practical routes to
improvement in our
teaching, which is already
compared favourably to
other UK universities. It has
been sent out as we wrote
it, and I hope students and
staff will discuss the issues
it raises as widely as
possible.

Dear Sir,
Have any of your readers
noticed the incredible
similarity between Chelsea

Martin Taylor and FELIX

wonder if they are by any
chance related?

AIDS: Why FELIX
Got It Wrong
Dear Hugh,
This letter concerns the
article that appeared in
FELIX two weeks ago (16th
May) on the subject of
AIDS (Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome).
Despite the fact that I, and
other Biochemists/Medics
who read the article felt it
to be poorly written, it is
perhaps more important to
correct the inaccuracies
and comment on some of
the matters not raised.
White Blood Cells
(WBC), and particularly T-
Lymphocytes, which are
those cells specifically
infected by the AIDS virus,
are not produced in the
Thymus, which it should be
noted is not found in the
neck. As the article later
suggested, W B C originate
from precursor stem cells
in the bone marrow.
Unfortunately this was not
the only example of
misleading journalism.
Cure versus vaccine? At
the present time trie
advances being made tend
to suggest that a cure is
the more probable of the
two. Various drugs that
inhibit an enzyme (Reverse
Transcriptase) specific to
the AIDS virus which is not
utilised by the human
metabolism are undergoing
trials. However, it is very
important to be aware that
a miracle cure is unlikely in
the near future.
Government spending on
AIDS and all its related
problems is minimal. One
page advertisements in the
national press warning of
the danger of AIDS are not
going to save lives.
Although no figures exist,
a virulent strain of the virus
causing AIDS (HTLV III)
has claimed the lives of
large numbers of men and
women in central Africa .
Since the virus is thought
to have originated in this
area of the world, it is likely
that the growth of spread
of the disease is more
advanced than in the UK or
the USA. That could mean
that millions are infected.
Too often articles on AIDS
forget the Southern
Hemisphere.
The most well-informed
group dealing with AIDS in
this country is the Terrence
Higgins Trust (THT). The
THT was set up to: 'inform,
advise and help on AIDS'.
At the present time the
THT suggests the following
data: Between 20,000 and
50,000 people are infected
with the AIDS virus in the
UK. The number in the
USA is thought to be close
to 2 million. 10 to 15% of
those infected go onto
develop AIDS, and of these,
close on 100% die. 15% of
those infected suffer from
AIDS related symptoms.
The remaining 70% are
alive and well. This
information raises three
important points:
Firstly, whether or not all
those infected are aware of
the fact and are taking
necessary precautions to
prevent spread of the AIDS
virus.
Secondly, how
meaningful any application
of statistics can be when
the sample number is so
small and thought to be so
non-randomised. How
many married homosexual
men, bisexual men or men
'secretly' practicing
homosexual acts are
infected?
Thirdly, the emotional
suffering of those people
who have been tested for
the presence of antibodies
to the AIDS virus and are
positive (infected), but are,
to all intents and purposes,
fit and well physically. Even
if the percentage of these
people who go on to
develop AIDS is small,
there is no way at the
present time that an
individual can know if s/he
will fall within that group or
not. Living with this as a
possible prospect has
resulted in a great deal of
trauma.
The latest twist in the
complexity of the AIDS
viral infection is the
relatively new
observation/symptom of
dementia and other brain
disease. How long does
this take to occur, and what
percentage of peope will it
affect?
The above deals with
only a fraction of the
problems AIDS has
brought. What are we doing
about it?
Yours sincerely,
Simon Lewis
