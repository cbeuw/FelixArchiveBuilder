But is it good for you?
It seems like this year is health
consciousness year. The papers are
full of fad diets and alternative
medicine articles. Every nutritionist
stresses the need for a healthy diet,
daily relaxation and physical fitness.
So why does Joe Student ignore
this bombardment and continue to
eat those stodgy puddings and jam
doughnuts.
Many people think that healthy
eating means forfeiting all their
I favourite foods and having to chomp
ion boring or tasteless vegetables.
Others disregard healthy food
because they believe it to be difficult
to prepare and time consuming. It's
much easier to open a packet of
crisps and a can of cola than to
create your own minestrone soup.
T h e proportions of the different
kinds of food are very important. A
healthy b o d y n e e d s five parts of
carbohydrate to one part of protein
and one of fat. If y o u upset your
balance then you've got no c a u s e to
c o m p l a i n w h e n y o u keep on getting
those recurring c o l d s .
A s carbohydrates are the principle
s o u r c e of energy it is quite easy to
survive on just a diet of white sugar
and water but this doesn't keep y o u r
tissues healthy a n d functioning
properly. It's m u c h better to derive
y o u r energy from the starch in
potatoes or the natural sugars in
fruit.
For proper functioning of the
intestines y o u need fibre. It is
c o m p o s e d of c o m p l e x
w
c a r b o h y d r a t e s w h i c h the body
cannot digest so that it passes
through the body u n c h a n g e d ,
trapping saturated fats, reducing the
absorption of cholesterol and
swelling up in water to give that full
feeling. Most refined f o o d s have all
the fibre removed so it's essential
that y o u either a d d bran to y o u r diet
or start eating w h o l e m e a l foods.
Fats are completely u n n e c e s s a r y
after the first six months of life as a
healthy liver p r o d u c e s sufficent
cholesterol for all the body's needs.
It is k n o w n n o w that high
concentrations of saturated fat in
the blood stream are closely
associated with heart disease. For
this reason the d a n g e r foods are
those containing animal fats w h i c h
are mostly saturated. If your diet
contains large a m o u n t s of fatty
meats, butter and c h e e s e then y o u
s h o u l d think seriously about
substituting margarine for butter,
olive oil for lard and low fat c h e e s e s
for those tasty full-fat soft ones.
R e m e m b e r that the secret of healthy
eating is b a l a n c e and the o c c a s i o n a l
i n d u l g e n c e is easily corrected in the
d a y s that follow.
What you should be!

In O c t o b e r 1983 the National
A d v i s o r y C o m m i t t e e on Nutrition
E d u c a t i o n ( N A C N E ) published
r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s for british eating.
In a lengthy report it did not suggest
radical c h a n g e s in diet but gradual
movement away from fat and
carbohydrates to a higher-fibre diet
a n d smaller portions of the danger
foods.
It s u g g e s t e d the following
guidelines for eating:
F A T Y o u s h o u l d try to reach a fat
c o n s u m p t i o n of no more than 30%
of y o u r total calories. That's a target
of about 90 grams. O n l y 30 g r a m s
s h o u l d be saturated (fats from meat,
pastry, c h e e s e , milk a n d chocolate).
S o , no more M a r s bars today!
S U G A R T h e s u g g e s t e d target is
about 20kg per year (which may
s o u n d an awful lot but the current
c o n s u m p t i o n is a r o u n d 45kg per
head). Try cutting d o w n that white
s u g a r in tea and coffee or c h a n g i n g
to b r o w n sugar if y o u feel y o u can't
d o without it. M o s t of the s u g a r
c o n s u m e d is in manufactured foods
s u c h as baked beans and tinned
s o u p s .
O T H E R C A R B O H Y D R A T E S
55% of the calorie content of y o u r
diet s h o u l d be contributed by
carbohydrates. If you're cutting
d o w n on the 'bad' carbs then it
m e a n s boosting the ' g o o d ' o n e s
s u c h as fruit sugars and starch. S o
eat more bread, potatoes, fruit and
vegetables.
F I B R E E s s e n t i a l . At least 30 g r a m s of
fibre a day w h i c h means lots of
w h o l e m e a l bread a n d pastas.
S A L T At present Mr Average
c o n s u m e s 8-12g per day w h i c h
s h o u l d be r e d u c e d to 5-7g.
