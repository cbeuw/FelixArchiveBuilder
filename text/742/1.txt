Snip,
Union Finance Committee has
decided on a programme of
cuts to save £2,650 from the
proposed Union budgets for
next year at a meeting last
Friday. The cuts are needed
because one Union's proposed
expenditure for next year
exceeded expected income by a
substantial amount.
U F C have:
• C u t c o n t i n g e n c y from £6,000
to £4,000
• £ 3 0 0 0 has to be found from
the current transport budget of
£8000 to contribute to the new
minibus. T h i s will result in
increased hire charges next
year.
• C u t almost all of the U n i o n ' s
s u b s i d y of a l c o h o l . T h e r e will
be no subsidy for the
Constituent C o l l e g e U n i o n s
( C C U s ) to buy beer, no s u b s i d y
for Real A l e S o c to buy beer
and W i n e Tasting S o c ' s s u b s i d y
of wine will be cut to 20%. T h i s
will save £1500.
• D e c i d e d the U n i o n s h o u l d
budget for a deficit of £2000-
£3000 w h i c h they hope will be
met from increased b o o k s h o p
i n c o m e and m o n e y unspent at
the end of this year,
• a g r e e d that C a n o e C l u b
s h o u l d cut its budget by £650.
• C u t the C C U s by £1500. It has
been suggested that most of
Snip,
this m o n e y s h o u l d be raised by
the closure of the C C U rifle and
pistol clubs.
• C u t the Major S u b C o m m i t t e e s
( M S C ) by £500. £150 of w h i c h
Dave Kingston: 'The meeting
went fairly well'
will be cut from Recreational
C l u b s C o m m i t t e e ( R C C ) , £100
will be cut from Athletics C l u b s
C o m m i t t e e ( A C C ) and
Publications B o a r d and £50 will
be cut from the other M S C s .
• C u t the other U n i o n
committees (including welfare,
Snip
external affairs, rag, etc) up to
£500.
It had been initially s u g g e s t e d
that U F C might d e c i d e to
completely cut several high
s p e n d i n g clubs. A n u m b e r of
clubs under threat were a s k e d
to justify their s p e n d i n g to the
meeting. R o y a l S c h o o l of M i n e s
U n i o n ( R S M U ) president Dave
Pearce p r o p o s e d that yacht,
balloon and gliding s h o u l d be
ciosed. S o c i a l Cultural and
A m u s e m e n t s B o a r d ( S C A B )
C h a i r m a n Nick S h a c k l e y
p r o p o s e d that the meeting
s h o u l d go into c l o s e d s e s s i o n
while M r Pearce's proposal was
being d i s c u s s e d . It was finally
defeated although the vote was
described as being fairly close.
Deputy President Dave
K i n g s t o n told F E L I X that the
'meeting went fairly well'. H e
said that it had adopted the
most business like a p p r o a c h of
any U n i o n meeting this year.
T h e m e m b e r s of U F C went in
with the attitude that they had
to decide there and then where
the cuts were to be made.
Recreational C l u b s
C o m m i t t e e C h a i r m a n T i m
Palmer said that the meeting
went far better than it c o u l d
have. 'I w a s very pleased that
they didn't start cutting c l u b s '
he said.
Second Time Around
Departments have been a s k e d
to introduce S e p t e m b e r resits
for s e c o n d years. In the first
report of the Undergraduate
Studies Committee. T h e report,
w h i c h will be presented to the
B o a r d of Studies on J u n e 25th,
contains a number of other
recommendations for major
c h a n g e s in the way
undergraduate c o u r s e s are run.
T h e Undergraduate Studies
Committee, w h i c h includes
a m o n g its m e m b e r s a c a d e m i c s ,
I C U president C a r l B u r g e s s and
the C C U A A O s , was set up to
look at ways of improving
undergraduate education.
T h e report says that 'many
students w h o resit in S e p t e m b e r
after 'failing' their first year
examinations, subsequently
achieve a creditable h o n o u r s
degree. It c o n c l u d e s that the
lack of s e c o n d - y e a r S e p t e m b e r
resit examinations leads to
unnecessary failures and also
wastes students' time.
Engineering departments
have been asked in the report to
look at w a y s of reducing failure
rates. It r e c o m m e n d s the
engineering departments look at
ways of adopting a c o u r s e unit
system similar to that adopted
in many s c i e n c e subjects this
Would mean that students were
not required to pass every
single part of their course.
T h e total work load placed on
a student s h o u l d be limited to
about forty hours a week-
a c c o r d i n g to the report w h i c h
suggest that organised learning
time should be a r o u n d twenty
hours and students s h o u l d be
d o i n g about ten to fifteen hours
of solid work s u c h as writing
essays.
Other recommendations of
the report include:
• T h e introduction of a
certificate of teaching
e x c e l l e n c e that w o u l d be
awarded annually to not more
than 30% of a c a d e m i c staff and
that w o u l d be an important
factor in promotion.
• T h e introduction of c o u r s e s in
learning skills
• T h e introduction of a C o l l e g e -
wide rating of teaching.
I C U President Carl B u r g e s s
d e s c i b e d the report as the best
that c o u l d be achieved in the
time available. ' S o m e of the
proposals are fairly radical' he
said 'but they are necessary'. H e
predicted that there w o u l d be a
lot of heated d i s c u s s i o n at
B o a r d of Studies. H e hoped,
though, that 'reason will win
out'.
I C U A c a d e m i c Affairs Officer
J Martin Taylor said that the
committee r e c o m m e n d a t i o n s
'seem like g o o d c o m m o n sense
proposals that s h o u l d have
been adopted years ago. I
remain sceptical about whether
they will result in significant
changes'.
