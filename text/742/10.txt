West End Shows
It is the first week in August,
and all over Edinburgh teams
armed with scaffolding and
screwdrivers are attacking
church halls, assembly rooms
and even crypts. In a space of
less than seven days all will be
transformed from empty
rooms into fully operational
theatres and auditoria. Garish
circus tents will appear in
parks and gardens all around
the city. Buskers and street
artists converge on squares
and outside galleries. Venues
range from the dingy depths
of Cepha's Cellar — where a
dud seat can land you behind
a pillar, unable to see the
stage — to the cavernous
spaces of the Assembly
Rooms in George Street.
However, all are part of the
Edinburgh Fringe Festival.
While the 'official' Festival rolls
on with its military tattoos and
traditional concerts for the
tourists, the Fringe takes care
of the new ground in theatre.
Last year, the Fringe fielded
somewhere in the region of
900 shows, and is expected to
go up by 10% this year, to give
well over a thousand. It has
reached a point where the
Fringe is better known across
the world than the festival
which gave it a reason to
exist. Edinburgh has become
synonymous with outrageous
street theatre and
undecipherable plays. The
Fringe is coordinated from a
small office in a road running
between the Castle and
Holyrood Palace, known as
the Royal Mile. There are two
permanent staff, assisted by
The Edinburgh Festival is probably thj largest arts festival of its kind —
known more for the antics of the Fringe than for its traditional concerts.
Imperial College is itself a major contributor, present not only as an acting
company, but as one of the more important venues: Venue 126 — Theatre
West End.
volunteers and part-timers.
Their job is to offer help to
both acting groups and the
people who run venues, and to
produce a 96-page brochure
detailing every show in the
three weeks of the festival to
give away to the crowds of
tourists and theatre-goers that
pack the doorway of the ticket
office.
Imperial College itself
contributes, both to the acting
side and to the less glamorous
side of running a theatre for
those three weeks. T h e
Dramatic Society operates
under the name of Theatre
West End, running a venue in
a church hall at the west end
of Princes Street, overlooked
by the Castle itself. Since its
inception in 1983, T W E has
grown to become one of the
largest venues on the Fringe
in terms-of the number of
shows it stages, competing
with semi-professional
companies like Tic Toe and
the Pleasance Theatre.
The Theatre itself consists
of two auditoria, one in the
church hall itself which seats
120; and a smaller evening
venue downstairs, seating 50,
converted from its daytime use
as a cafe, known as the
Cornerstone.
Although Theatre West End
exists as a venue for only
three weeks, the job of
running it lasts for nearly a
year. Just before the end of
the autumn term, in
December, the four members
of the Executive, who have the
task of creating the theatre for
yet another year, have to be
elected. The Exec consists of
an Administrator, a Treasurer,
a Technical Co-ordinator and
a Publicity Officer. The
Administrator has the
unenviable job of negotiating
the contract for the rental of
the premises, dealing with all
21 of the individual companies
wanting to hire slots and on
top of that find somewhere to
live in Edinburgh for the entire
staff. The Treasurer's job is
fairly self-explanatory — the
accountant and signer of the
cheques. The Technical C o -
ordinator has to organise the
fitting out of both theatres
with lighting, sound and even
seats. The Publicity Officer's
main task is to produce a
brochure detailing all the 26
shows to be performed at
TWE.
The first job of the Exec is
to produce a prospectus to be
sent out to the theatre-groups
around the country who are
looking to go to Edinburgh.
The selling of slots is
reinforced by the monthly
Fringe meetings which begin
in January. Taking place at
the Donmar Warehouse in
Covent Garden, the first two
are reminiscent of cattle
markets as venue managers
are paraded before their
potential sub-lets.
Soon, after various changes
as groups drop out and are
replaced, the slots are all
filled. Once this is done,
tickets can be ordered and the
details sent off to the Fringe
Office to be included amongst
the incredible array of groups
at other theatres in the Fringe
Guide.
During May, the sub-lets are
chased up for their brochure
entries and for their special
technical requirements. Where

do they want the slide

lanterns? Then, all the
paraphenalia is ordered, ready
to be shipped to Edinburgh.
