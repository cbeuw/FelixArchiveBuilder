Laudrup mean that they've
got to be a good bet.
Since this is meant to be a
guide to what ons next week
and not the column for a
Chelsea supporter to rant on
at length about his views on
world football, I'd better tell
you what are the highlights of
next weeks football on TV.
Bulgaria is not really a
country who one normally
thinks of us a major force in
cut out. Northern Ireland play
Algeria on Tuesday (ITV
7pm). This should be one of
the most boring games of the
week. The Northern Irish will
probably stuff the Algerians
or the Algerians will hang on
for a 0-0 draw. Other
highlights of the week are
Italy v Argentina (Thursday
ITV 7pm) and West Germany
v Uruguay (Wednesday BBC
7pm).
"...now I've got the football out of
the way, I can start being arty
farty."
world football. Despite this
.they managed to beat France
I and Uruguay, two of the best
countries in the world, in the
run up to the Cup. They start
the tournament against Italy
on Saturday (see above for
details) in what should be the
match of the week. England
play their first game of the
tournament against Portugal
on Tuesday (BBC 11pm). To
be honest if England don't
stuff the Portuguese who have
had a players strike in the run
up to the tournament, they
don't stand a chance.
Scotland start their campaign
with a game against Denmark
on Wednesday (ITV 11pm).
Scotland will have their work
Right now I've got the
football out of the way, I can
start being artfarty. The other
day I was sitting in the bath
and an Alabanian mountain
cyclist came up to me and
spat on me...Sorry I was
getting carried away. There
seems to be a lot going on.
Musically the highlight seems
to be The Comunards and
Sheila Smith on Friday night
at the Royal Festiavl Hall.
Sommerville and Coles
promise an evening of raw,
undiluted soul. Also on
Friday is an illuminated 400
Blows gig at the St Matthews
Meeting Place. I don't know
much about them but I'm told
that they are a crucial band
Have you noticed the
number of the puesdo-hippies
there are around College.
These huppies (hippy yuppies
geddit) rush round the
country at weekends seeing
bands like Haze and Inner
City Unit before returning to
their Samsonite briefcases on
Monday. Well boys (and
girls—musn't be sexist) you
don't have to leave London
this weekend Dr and the
Medics play Grays Civic Hall
on Friday and the Cramps
play the Hammersmith Palais
on Sunday and Monday
(Capital Ideas wouldn't be
complete without a mention
of the Cramps). Incidentaly
anyone wanting a copy of the
excellant Festival Eye, the
magazine of the Stonehenge
Festival they can buy it from
the FELIX Office.
For anyone interested in
art, the International
Contemporary Art Festival at
Olympia has got to be a must.
Open until Sunday (11am-
8pm) its the biggest art
exhibition in Europe this year.
If you want to go and see a
film go and see Helena
Bonham-Carter in Lady Jane
(review elsewhere). I haven't
seen as good a film in ages.
Its really slushy so I liked it
as I'm getting romantic.
Before I start churning out
pages on marriage etc and
ruin Chris Edwards' chance to
piss about with arty farty
layout, I'd better finish off
with cricket. Middlesex play
Sussex at Lords in the quarter
finals of Benson and Hedges
on Wednesday. Don't miss it!
