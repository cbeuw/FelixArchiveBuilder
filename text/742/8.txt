For the past eight years,
Trevor N u n n has been
artistic director of the
Royal S h a k e s p e a r e
c o m p a n y . It s h o u l d c o m e
as no surprise therefore
that his first major feature
film is full of s o m e of this
country's finest actors a n d
actresses.
The film is set against a
b a c k g r o u n d of the
Reformation when a large
n u m b e r of individuals had
a c q u i r e d wealth and
property by removing
R o m a n C a t h o l i c m o n k s
i f r o m their monasteries a n d
were hence a n x i o u s to
prevent the throne
returning to a R o m a n
Catholic. T o achieve this
the D u k e of
N o r t h u m b e r l a n d arranges
for the quiet scholarly L a d y '
J a n e G r e y to s u c e e d the
' d y i n g E d w a r d VI and for
her to marry his s o n , the
I libertine Lord G u i l f o r d .
T h e resulting piece is a
| mixture between a well
i illustrated history lesson
I a n d a d i s c o u r s e on the
] relationship between power
a n d evil a n d a r o m a n c e ,
a n d as s u c h s u c e e d s rather
well on all levels. T h e
nature of the relationships
I requires s o m e
i concentration early o n , but
the story is pretty straight-
forward after that, a n d the
acting and the c h o i c e of
locations are excellent.
S o m e of the humanist
I tendencies of the y o u n g
| c o u p l e s are a bit laboured,
but ultimately it's a very
enjoyable piece of
entertainment.
Whilst on the subject of
theatre, I'd like to mention
the marvellous The
Lightship. It's setting has
the s a m e limited number of
s c e n e s as a play a n d it is
this c l a u s t r o p h o b i a that
gives this film a lot of it's
power.
Robert Duvall plays the
leader of a group of three
criminals w h o c o m e to be
stranded on K l a u s Maria
Brandauer's lightship.
T h e r e then ensues a battle
of wits between the
brilliantly evil Robert Duvall
a n d the pacifist captain.
Initially the story contains a
more detailed analysis of
the reasons for the
behaviour of the two
protagonists and the
questions thus prompted
but director J e r z y
S k o l m o w s k i has shrewdly
d e c i d e d to concentrate on
the s u s p e n s e and has
m a n a g e d to p r o d u c e a very
tense thriller without
sacrificing depth of
characterisation. I didn't
breathe properly for one
a n d half hours; highly
r e c o m m e n d e d .
Having mentioned the
s e c o n d best of this w e e k s
films I may as well mention
the best, After Hours. It is a
wonderfully imaginative
c o m e d y about a c o m p u t e r
programmer's disastrous
night out in S o h o . Paul
(Griffin D u n n e , last seen in
varying states of d e c a y in
American Werewolf in
London) meets the
attractive but distracted
M a r c y in a coffee bar o n e
evening. S h e gives him a
friends's n u m b e r a n d w h e n
he pets h o m e he decides to
try a n d contact her a g a i n .
This leads him to a
nightmare j o u r n e y t h r o u g h
d o w n t o w n S o h o w h e n
everything (and I m e a n
everything) g o e s w r o n g . At
o n e point w h e n he is being
c h a s e d by a m o b he sees a
killing through a b e d r o o m
w i n d o w and and c o m m e n t s
'They'll probably blame me
for that too'.
Director Martin S c o r s e s e
launches the a u d i e n c e
straight into the breakneck
p a c e right from the
o p e n i n g shot, a n d then
g o e s on to make even the
most i n n o c u o u s b u n c h of
keys a fearful object. T h e
most imaginative and
enjoyable film I have seen
for a long time; wonderful.
'My M o m told me never
to d o this': C T h o m a s
Howell's first line when he
picks up The Hitcher,
Rutger Hauer. Believe me
his m u m was right. Rutger
Hauer (in grave d a n g e r of
being typecast) turns out to
be an A n g e l of Death w h o
g o e s a r o u n d killing people
(as A n g e l s of Death are
wont to d o I s u p p o s e ) and
asks our hero, J i m to help
him. J i m is then
consistently framed for all
the evil d e e d s a n d has a
hard time e s c a p i n g the
authorities and tracking
d o w n the evil J o h n R y d e r
(Mr Hauer), at the s a m e
time.
It's actually a very g o o d
film, and a debut worthy of
c o m p a r i s o n with
Spielberg's Duel, with
s o m e superb photography,
from J o h n Searle w h o
filmed Witness and s o m e
car c h a s e s that are not all
boring. Worth a visit if
you've s e e n the other films
mentioned so far.
In the 19th Century,
anatomists were only
allowed to work on the
bodies of hanged
murderers. Therefore the
dedicated Dr T h o m a s R o c k ,
w h o felt that the end
justified the means in the
quest for knowledge, paid
m o n e y for c o r p s e s , the
fresher the better, leading
Fallen a n d B r o o m to
murder people to earn a
comparatively comfortable
living.
Doctor and the Devils is
directed by Freddie Francis
w h o was the c i n e m a
photographer on Elephant
Man and Dune but w h o
also directed a large
n u m b e r of H a m m e r Horror
films. T h i s b a c k g r o u n d is
unfortunately evident in
this latest film, and though
it d o e s improve it's difficult
to shake off this initial
reaction.
J o n a t h a n P r y c e and
Stephen R e a c o m e a c r o s s
as a bit of a c o m e d y d u o as
Fallen a n d B r o o m a n d the
film fails to address itself to
Dr R o c k ' s obvious moral
d i l e m m a . Perhaps the
original book by Dylan
T h o m a s is better.
