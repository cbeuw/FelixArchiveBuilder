Test Cases
In a bid to improve the diets of the
average IC student, I picked four
people and asked them to list all
that they had consumed in the
previous 24 hours
Charles, a first year Physicist
Breakfast
Orange
Cornflakes, milk, no
sugar
2 pieces of toast with
margarine and
marmalade
One cup of tea.
Lunch
Dinner
Others
Minestrone Soup
Two slices of white
bread.
One lamb chop
Rice
Sweetcorn.
1 packet of crisps
Can of coke.
Hugh, a fourth year Chemical
Engineer.
No set meal times.
Olive
Bread and Pate
Pasty
A Southside pizza
3 cans of Fosters
2 pints of Castelmaine
1 tea
Chris, a first year Computing
scientist.
Breakfast
None
Lunch
Ham Bap
Dinner
Two packets of crisp
2 pints of Directors.
Dave, a third year Mechanical
Engineer
Breakfast
3 Weetabix and milk
2 cups of coffee
Lunch
1 tin of sardines on 2
slices of toast
2 oranges
Dinner
1/4 lb cheeseburger
and chips
1/2 packet of crackers
1 tomato juice and
Worcester sauce
1 pint of Guinness.
My first reaction was how on earth
does Chris survive? Secondly it
confirmed all my fears about IC's
average consumption. Charles diet
is reasonable. He has 3 square
meals a day but it's high in
carbohydrates and low in fibre. He
needs to substitute a good
wholemeal bread for that white stuff
and perhaps a high fibre cereal
instead of cornflakes. Minestrone
soup has a high sugar content as
does tinned sweetcorn and that can
of coke. His fat intake, though, is
fine as he uses margarine and has
about half a pint of milk.
Hugh's diet, however, is sadly
lacking in most of the essentials.
Pate and cheese are both high in
saturated fats as is the pastry in the
pasty. Biscuits and bread are high in
carbohydrates and contain little
fibre and that pizza, although
topped with various vegetables,
provides very little nutrients in
proportion to the number of calories
it contains. The average adult
should consume one pint of beer a
day but Hugh has far exceeded this.
Their is no nutrition in a can of
Fosters but loads of lovely calories
and that alcohol overworks the liver.
My advice to Hugh is to think about
what he is eating and not to treat
everything he consumes as a
convenient filler. He needs to eat at
least a piece of fruit a day and a
good helping of greens which are
good sources of riboflavin, folic
acid, and iron, magnesium and
calcium. As with Charles, he needs
to boost his fibre intake. You must
have bad bowel problems Hugh! If
time is money then bread, rice and
pasta all contain certain amounts of
fibre. Cut down on the fast foods
and alcohol and if the nearest food
is in the Union Bar then nothings
better than a packet of peanuts for
added protein.
There's little I can say about
Chris' diet the only protein has been
derived from the ham in the bap. He
needs more fruit, vegetables, breads,
cereals, fish, nuts, and poultry
because he's lacking fibre, vitamins
A, B,C, and D, iron and trace
minerals such as magnesium and
potassium.
Dave's diet has to be one of the
best (for a student). His fibre is
derived from the Weetabix, toast and
crackers, his vitamins from the fruit
juice, oranges and fishes, his protein
from the sardines and burger and
iron in his Guinness. The only bad
point is the lack of vegetables and
those chips with his cheeseburger.
Deep fat fried food is definitely out!.
All of these diets show that a busy
Southside student relies heavily on
easy-to-prepare or fast food.
Perhaps this is a case for better
kitchen facilities? Even so, this is no
excuse for the unhealthy diets
prevalent at this college.
Here's how my hypothetical,
student would eat.
Breakfast
Bran flakes, sultanas
and milk
Wholemeal toast and
magarine
One cup of tea.
Baked potato and
cottage cheese
Serving of raw
mushroom or peppers
One cup of coffee or
apple juice.
Chilli pot (see recipe)
Fruit or yogurt
Fruit juice
Peanuts
Oat crunchie bar.
Lunch
Dinner
Snacks
Chilli Pot (serves 1)
Calories 310
Preparation 5 mins
Cooking 45 mins.
Contains red kidney beans which
are extremely high in fibre and very
low in fat. Both beef and beans
contain a variety of B Vitamins.
Ingredients
1 small onion, chopped finely
4oz lean minced beef
Garlic to taste
1 teaspoon chilli power or to taste
3 teaspoons tomato puree
4fl oz chicken stock
2 chopped tomatoes
chopped green pepper
pepper, to taste
1 can of red kidney beans rinsed and |
drained
Method
Place the onion and minced beef in
a saucepan over medium heat and
cook without adding extra fat until
evenly browned. Add garlic chilli,
tomato puree, stock, tomatoes,
pepper and green pepper. Bring to
boil, cover and simmer for 35 mins
Add beans and cook for a further 5
minutes.
Healthy cooking isn't just a matter
of using fresh, nutritious foods but '
how you cook them as well.
Boiling Destroys vitamins and
minerals such as B Complex and
Vitamin C.
Frying Adds fat in most cases. The j
best form is stir-frying which
combines steaming and frying. A j
small amount of oil is heated
intensely before pieces of chopped
food are added. This seals the food
quickly and reduces the loss of
vitamins and minerals.
Roasting Particularly healthy as it
doesn't require additional fat. Always
cover with foil to retain the moisture.
Steaming Healthiest way of
preparing fish and vegetables with
little vitamin loss.
Microwave The shorter cooking time!
preserves more of the vitamins andj
reheated food loses fewer minerals.
Good food can be tasty and quick tol
prepare. All it takes is a little bit of
thought and planning. Just
remember that balance is essential
and that you can still eat all those
things you really like in moderation.
Take pleasure in what you eat but
always ask: It is good for you?
FELIX Friday 30 May
