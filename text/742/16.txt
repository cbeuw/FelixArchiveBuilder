I Eight Outstanding
Eight research subjects at
Imperial C o l l e g e are rated
as outstanding by the
University G r a n t s
C o m m i t t e e . T h e University
G r a n t s C o m m i t t e e made
their a s s e s s m e n t as part of
their p r o c e s s for fixing the
grants to be given to
Universities. T h e subjects
rated as outstanding were
Biochemistry, C h e m i s t r y ,
P h y s i c s , Mathematics,
C o m p u t e r S c i e n c e
C h e m i c a l E n g i n e e r i n g , Civil
Engineering a n d
M e c h a n i c a l , A e r o n a u t i c a l
a n d P r o d u c t i o n
E n g i n e e r i n g . P u r e and
A p p l i e d B i o l o g y , Electrical
E n g i n e e r i n g , Metalurgy a n d
M a n a g e m e n t S c i e n c e were
rated as better than
average. G e o l o g y , M i n e r a l
Engineering and the
research centres were rated
as average. Humanities
were rated below average.
T h e U G C sent a detailed
letter to all universities on
T u e s d a y night explaining
h o w they assessed the
University's grant. Included
in the letter is an
assessment of e a c h
department. T h i s is based
on quality of research and
the amount of m o n e y the
department receives from
outside the university
system to support. It gives
no indication of the quality
of teaching.
P r o Rector Prof A l a n
S w a n s o n told F E L I X
yesterday that the letter
giving details of our
research rating a n d the
earlier letter giving details
of a 1.3% rise in grant in
c a s h terms (see last week's
F E L I X ) meant the outlook
was not as bad as it might
have been. H e said, t h o u g h ,
the outlook was as bad as
the C o l l e g e had expected.
T h e C o l l e g e w o u l d , he said,
look for money from
outside. T h i s w o u l d be
helped by the high rating
given to our research. It
w o u l d mean, t h o u g h , that
a c a d e m i c s would be
restricted to do the work
that their s p o n s o r s wanted
them to do.
U n i o n President C a r l
B u r g e s s said the below
average rating for the
Humanities Department
s h o w e d there was
insufficient provision for
humanities.
Gotcha!
The victim of a callous criminal.
U n i o n H o n S e c Quentin
F o n t a n a had his teddy bear
k i d n a p p e d on S u n d a y by a
d a n g e r o u s m a s k e d raider.
T h e teddy bear was held to
ransom by R a g .
Mr Fontana told F E L I X
on W e d n e s d a y that he was
very upset by the kidnap.
He said that it had meant
he 'didn't have anything to
s n u g g l e up to'. H e said that
he had asked the m a s k e d
raider into his r o o m to give
her coffee. H e admitted
that although he didn't
have any kidnap insurance
he paid the r a n s o m
i b e c a u s e he had to save
teddy. H e said he was so
upset that he went to the
C h a r l e s Wells brewery on
T u e s d a y to get 'pissed'.
T h e m a s k e d raider told
F E L I X that M r F o n t a n a had
paid the ransom. S h e said
that s h e realised that M r
F o n t a n a was attached to
his teddy when s h e saw
him 'sulking w h e n ever
C h r i s t i n e hit his head
against the wall' so she
d e c i d e d to kidnap it.
It is understood the teddy
was returned to M r Fontana
at 6 p m on W e d n e s d a y
evening.

ASTMS
Say No
A group is being set up at

e x c h a n g e information on
the Starwars program. T h e

electronics for peace
group, the c o m p u t i n g a n d
social responsibility g r o u p
a n d other interested parties
in a n d outside of C o l l e g e .
T h e group is being
organised by J o h n F e c a m p
the A S T M S (Association of
Scientific.Technical a n d
Managerial Staff)
representative at Imperial
M r F e c a m p hopes that the
g r o u p will provide
information to enable
'those with a political
p u n c h ' to ask appropriate
quesitions in Parliament.
T h e move follows the
A S T M S decision on the
12th of M a y to c a m p a i g n
against Star W a r s research
contracts, on the g r o u n d s
that the m o n e y w o u l d be
better spent elsewhere, a n d
the SDI is likely to provoke
a Soviet first strike.
Grounds Will
Be OK
Work on the extraction of
gravel from the C o l l e g e ' s
sports ground at Harlington
is set to start as s o o n as
the cricket s e a s o n has
ended. At the last meeting
of Athletics G r o u n d
C o m m i t t e e C o l l e g e
G r o u n d s m a n M i c k
R e y n o l d s presented plans
for pitches during the work.
U n i o n representatives said
that they were more than
satisfied with the plans.
T h e y said there were
e n o u g h pitchs for the
U n i o n ' s needs. U n i o n H o n
S e c Q u e n t i n F o n t a n a said
that in addition the work
w a s likely to improve the
quality of the pitchs. T h i s
b e c a u s e they are
developing ridges at
present a n d the work will
give the C o l l e g e the
opportunity to relay the
pitches s o that ridges will
unable to develop.
