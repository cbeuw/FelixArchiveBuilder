HI ilda Murrell was
murdered on the 21st
M a r c h 1984. A seventy
eight year old ex-rose
grower, she was deeply
committed to the peace
movement and dared to
speak out about what s h e
felt. The Tricycle in
association with The
Sheffield C r u c i b l e present
C h r i s Martin's investigation
into the death, and events
surrounding the death of
Hilda Murrell.
There is no plot in the
conventional sense, this is
not a conventional play.
Key dates are used to
string the various different
a c c o u n t s and pieces of
evidence together. Hilda
Murrell, her nephew Robert
G r e e n (a retired R o y a l
Naval C o m m a n d e r involved
in intelligence), a reporter,
M P , police s p o k e s p e r s o n ,
peace c a m p a i g n e r and
nuclear scientist form the
core of the characters
involved. Each s p e a k s out,
sometimes in the form of a
dialogue, sometimes to the
a u d i e n c e directly. T h e
place and time of e a c h line
of thought varies but is
defined by the character(s)
in question. A c t 1 and most
of A c t 2 examines the
events surrounding Hilda
Murrell's death from every
angle, and details large
a m o u n t s of information.
The end of A c t 2 draws
the known evidence to a
close. This is followed by
an epilogue where it is
revealed that the text of the
play, whilst in the care of
the Post Office, had been
o p e n e d between sender
and receiver by s o m e
person(s) u n k n o w n . This
paradoxical event serves to
e x p o s e the 'State' still
further, for the big question
that this investigation poses
is whether or not the death
of this old lady was a 'State
crime'. N o fingers are
pointed. C h r i s Martin
avoids the pitfall of
o n e s i d e d n e s s , but then
with the evidence to hand,
no fingers need to be
pointed. T h e investigation
is painfully factual and the
a u d i e n c e is left to d e c i d e
for itself as to the c a u s e s of
Hilda Murrell's death.
Who killed Hilda Murrell
is a very important play, it
raises various questions:
the power of Whitehall over
Parliament, the s e c r e c y of
our society, the basis of
our d e m o c r a c y . For people
w h o care about these
things and what they
e n c o m p a s s , Who Killed
Hilda'Murrell s h o u l d be
seen; Political d r a m a at its
best.

â€¢Annie Raitt as Hilda Murrell gives a fine performance at The
Tricycle Theatre and captures the fire and passion of this highly
motivated lady.
Society's Debt.
The Almeida Theatre until
June 7th
Creditors, written in 1888
deals with the timeless
problems of relationships,
specifically those between
men and w o m e n . The
hundred years separating
the first performance of
Creditors in a small
experimental theatre in
C o p e n h a g e n , and its latest
run at the A l m e i d a have no
effect on the potency and
ease with which the
audience can relate to
Stringberg's misogynistic
and c o n f u s e d words.
Set entirely in the public
room of a seaside B & B the
action falls neatly into three
scenarios:
Initially Adolf, a painter
turned sculptor, is found
with the manipulative and
s c h e m i n g Gustav,
superficially just another
guest of the hotel. T h e y
s p e n d s o m e time
d i s c u s s i n g Adolf's
disabilities. His neurosis
with regard to his wife
Tekla, w h o he suspects is
being unfaithful, and her
u n n a m e d first h u s b a n d ,
referred to as being
something of a fool. Gustav
m a n a g e s to c o n v i n c e the
easily led Adolf that his
wife is the worst possible
cure for his physical and
increasingly mental
ailments:
'For a w o m a n , loving
means taking..this w o m a n
has eaten y o u r soul, y o u r
courage..'
'I gave and gave and
gave until I had nothing
left..'. Gustav leaves having
s o w n the seed of doubt in
Adolf's mind.
T e k l a enters
unsuspecting, and
gradually as she and Adolf
talk, his jealousy and fear
about losing the w o m a n he
'worships like a g o d ' 'who
has destroyed my faith in
m y s e l f unwinds.
T h r o u g h o u t this e n s u i n g
trauma, Adolf b e c o m e s
increasingly ambivalent
towards his wife as the
remembrence of her feeling
for her first husband
unfolds. Adolf leaves in a
rage.
A s if by s o m e magical
c o i n c i d e n c e , Tekla's first
h u s b a n d enters, and not
surprisingly he and Gustav
are one and the same! At
first Gustav attempts to
w o o his ex-wife and
appears to have genuine
feeling for her. However, as
Tekla realises that Adolf's
anger has been c a u s e d by
Gustav's intervention,
Gustav s h o w s his true self,
for he is the Creditor w h o
has c o m e to collect his
debt of honour by
destroying Adolf and Tekla.
Adolf has been listening
throughout this bout of
hard truth, and finally he
staggers in, pale and
shaking, c o l l a p s e s and
dies. T e k l a e m b r a c e s his
limp body. Gustav stands
truimphant.
The performance of Ian
M c D i a r m i d was particularly
memorable. He truly
captures the c y n i c i s m s and
manipulative qualities of
Gustav.
Creditors has been
described by many as
being largely
autobiographical. Indeed
the play's involvement of
two men with one w o m a n
bares a striking
resemblence to
Strindberg's o w n life.
Creditors is c o n f u s i n g but
in a s e n s e it sets out with
this end in mind. Ultimately
relationships are far from
simple. Perhaps Creditors
deals with the ambivalence
of men towards w o m e n ,
Gustav and Adolf represent
the two opposite sides of
the c o i n :
'I need her to worship
like God...I can't live
without something to
worship.'
