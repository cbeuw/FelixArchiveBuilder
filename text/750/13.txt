No More Bets Please
Blackjack is THE -GAME for
students of science and technology.
It combines the subjects ofstatistics,
computing, extra-sensory
perception and personal
psychology. No matter how many
computers you've got attached to
your left ankle. No matter how
many yards of computer printout
you've read from your personal
Cray 1
1 (which is constantly
analysing Blackjack hands in your
study bedroom) there is one
powerful tip that I can give to all
punters: if youfindyourselfhitting a
bad losing streak - never chase your
loss. Tomorrow is always another
day. In the long term if you play
Blackjack with the percentage in
your favour - you must come out on
top. The aim is to bet high when the
percentage is in your favour and low
(or not at all) when the percentage is
against you. To be able to judge
when the odds are in your favour it
is essential to fully master the rules
of the game.
Four packs of cards are used and
these are dealt from a shoe (a box
that reduces the possibility of a
'crooked' dealer manipulating the
deck). Each player bets before
seeing his two cards dealt face up by
the dealer. The dealer also deals one
card face up to herself.
As in Pontoon, the object of the
game is to get a total as near to 21 as
possible without busting (getting a
total of greater than 21). While a
player's total is under 21, he may
stand or draw a card. Players can
split pairs, i.e. if the first two cards
dealt to the player are the same then
the player can can put in a bet equal
to his initial stake and play two split
hands. The only restrictions are that
a player cannot split pairs of fours,
fives and tens. If a player splits aces
then only one more card is dealt to
each ace.
The other option is that a player
may double his stake if on the initial
two cards he is dealt a 'hard' 9,10,11
i.e. say a hard eleven made up oi a
six and five. If a player opts to
double then he is only dealt one
more card.
A Blackjack is when the player or
dealer gets a two card 21 made up of
a ten and an ace. (A ten can be a
Jack, Queen or King). If the player
is dealt a Blackjack, he receives a
bonus of half his stake i.e. if he bet
£10, he gets £15 plus his £10 making
£25. A player can ask for
'insurance', if he holds a Blackjack
and the dealer shows an ace. If a
player takes insurance he loses his
bonus and gets paid even money.
At the end of each round, the
players who have not bust compare
their individual totals with that of
the dealer. If their total is greater
than the dealer's then they are paid
even money. If their total equals the
dealer's, it is a 'standoff and no
money is lost or won on that-hand. If
one's total is less than the dealer's
then one has lost. If the dealer busts
then all players who have not busted
win!
For readers who intend to write
computer Blackjack simulation
programs there are a couple of
obscure details that will complete
the picture.
If a player splits a pair of aces and
is dealt a ten to one or both aces -
this is not classed as Blackjack but is
a normal 21. If the dealer gets a
Blackjack then the split bet is lost.
A player can double on a hard
two card 9,10 or 11 even after a split
i.e. if a player splits a pair of eights
and is dealt a three to thefirstand a
two to the second 8, he can double
on both hands (an outlay of four
times his initial stake). If he splits
eights and is dealt a 10 to thefirst8
and a 3 to the second eight, he can
still double his stake on the hand
which is hard eleven.
A Blackjack table is usually made
up of seven boxes i.e. up to seven
players can have individual hands (it
is possible for players to share
boxes). There is a rule that at least
two boxes must be active - so if you
are on your own at a Blackjack table
you will have to play two hands.
The minimum stake at Blackjack
is normally £5 but there are tables
which offer £1 or £3 minimum
during the early evening (Casinos
open from 2 pm to 4 am every day
except Saturday night when they
close at 2 am - an old tradition to
allow punters to have time to get
some sleep ready to go to church on
Sunday).
The final and perhaps most
important point of all is that
although four decks of cards are
available - the last 30 cards in every
shoe are "dead". A plastic marker is
inserted at that point by the dealer.
Once the marker has been reached,
the final cards to complete the
round are dealt and then all four
decks are shuffled and a player is
offered the chance to cut the decks
with another plastic marker.
Straight after the cut the cards are
placed in the shoe ready for a new
series of games.
If you've read this far, you know
how to play Blackjack. Now you
need to know how to win. The path
to fortune lies in knowing when the
odds are in your favour, and also
making the right decsions on
whether to stand or draw,
depending on the state of the decks.
The number of high and low
cards that are left to be dealt is the
key to estimating whether the odds
are in your favour or the dealer's. If
there is a bias towards more high
cards left then the dealer will bust
more often - and the odds are with
the player.
If there is a bias towards more
small cards left then the odds are
with the dealer.
A simple method of card
counting is to start your count from
zero at a new shoe and add 1 every
time a 2, 3, 4, or 5 is dealt and
subtract 1 every time a ten, Jack,
Queen or King appears. Divide the
current total by the approximate
number of decks left in the shoe, i.e.
say there have been 104 cards dealt
(2 decks) and you have a current
count of plus eight, the ratio is 8
divided by 2, 4. Suprisingly even a
small positive ratio can swing the
odds dramatically in the player's
favour.
More sophisticated card counting
can be employed but I have found,
after several years of playing
Blackjack, it is not important that
one has an accurate card count-
more a general feel of how the shoe
is progressing (this saves a lot of
work and improves one's enjoyment
of the game). Also, hunches play an
important part. If one is in tune with
the cards then profits come quickly,
if one is tired or distracted then
profit can be difficult to obtain.
A little bit of ESP and a lot of
personal psychology is a bonus, for
the player must recognise when he's
tired or losing his sharpness.
It's not too difficult to become a
member of a London casino. Simply
visit the casino of your choice (dress
reasonably smart) and give the
receptionist your particulars.
Casinos aim to "elect ladies and
gentlemen of good standing in
society". The consider students as
potential big money earners and
seem to ignore the fact that the
majority are carefully making their
grant last the term. Why not form a
syndicate-even if you don't gamble,
the restaurants are very good and
the atmosphere is worth
experiencing. Membership is
usually free. If elected to- the
Sporting Club you will be able to
gamble 48 hours after registration.
Never risk more than you can
afford-and if you do make a profit
treat yourself to something
special.
