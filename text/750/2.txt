Indsoc Backs
Union Policy
Dear Sir
Having read FELIX last week,
the Industrial Society regrets
clashing our Cheese and Wine with
the UGM. Our event was organised
in July and at that time we were
unaware of the UGM meeting dates.
We did not put up the bulk of our
posters on the day as a result, but by
then the damage was done.
The Industrial Society
reccommends to all students of IC
that they attend UGM's, as they are
the best way for students to
influence Union policy and be
represented.
Yours
Paul Basham
Dear Ed,
I was interested to read the
various comments on the
Indsoc/UGM clash last Tuesday.
Bloody minded? Well, I don't really
think so - the date for the 'get-
together' was fixed during the last
academic year, and we had no
complaints from ICU before the
event. I fully support Christine's
view, as expressed in her report, and
the Indsoc committee has agreed to
comply in future. As Membership
Secretary I would like everyone who
missed the get-together to know that
they can still join Indsoc. All our
events are free, and Â£1.50 sent to me
(cheques made out to ICU/SCC)
with your name and department will
bring you a membership card by
return of post, and our weekly
newsletter as it is issued. All the best.

Free Speech
And NUS
Dear Sir,
It was very interesting to note in
FELIX last week, a small article in
which the NUS opposed a proposed
Government bill allowing freedom
of speech on British university
campuses. It struck me as somewhat
hypocritical that the NUS wants to
protect the rights of blacks, gays,
Jews etc. in the light of the fact that
some NUS institutions, notably
Sunderland Polytechnic, have
banned their Jewish society on the
grounds that it is racist!
Putting the hypocrisy aside for a
moment, it is a highly suspect
argument that one can somehow
protect minority groups by
censoring information. The NUS
should remember that freedom of
speech on campuses would not only
allow the right-wing M.P.'s they
mention to speak, but also all the
minority groups that at present are
unable to do so.
Yours Sincerely,
John Ranson (Mech. Eng 2)
P.S. If the overweight member of the
Union Exec, wants my legs, he can
come and cut them off himself. If he
doesn't, I suggest that he spends less
time making silly threats and
digging up petty rules, and more
time worrying about the
consequences of the hypocritical
NUS taking over I.C.U.
FEUX 750
Upon reaching any milestone the
tendency is always to be
retrospective; in this instance, to
assess the progress FELIX has made
since it was spawned from the
Phoenix in 1949. Accordingly this
weeks issue includes several articles
by former Editors. Two of these
men were at College in the days of
the Imperial Institute, long before
FE1IX had its own Print Unit or
Sabbatical Editor. Paradoxically
this 750th issue is the first to be
produced entirely in our new offices
on the northside of Beit Quad
I am still not certain what effect
the move of the office will have on
FELIX in the long term. The site in
Beit Archway was indeed prime
one; I hope that being out "of the
way" is not going to deter people
from using the office. Looking at the
staunch support FELIX has had
from its student staff over the years,
I expect that the paper will continue
to flourish.Nevertheless I would
maintain that FELIX, over the last
ten years particularly influential,
and that the archway site was, at
least in part, responsible for this.

Calling All Residents
Dear Student,
The Student Residence Committee is made up of Wardens, Health
Centre officials and the Chief Surveyor for residences, along with your
President and the IC Council representative. This dubious post is my
responsibility. If you have any serious problems or complaints about
your hall or student house please let me know -1 might be able to help
where bureaucracy stands in the way. Anything from the telephone not
being mended for four weeks to the building falling down.
My involvement in this line of work started last year with the Southside
security problem, something which still needs a lot of work.
! I live in 72 Beit New Hostel or contact me in room 318 Geology or
Union letter racks.
I look forward to helping with your problems.
Yours,
Ian Howgate
P.S. Any suggestions on improving the halls would also be gladly heard
