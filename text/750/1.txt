T h e N e w s p a p e r Of Imperial C o l l e g e U n i o n F o u n d e d 1949
P l a y S c h o o l
The University of London's
Institute of Education and students
from the School of Oriental and
African Studies (SOAS) have
launched the 'London Childcare
campaign' in an attempt to persuade
universities in London to improve
their nursery facilities. Teaching and
student unions are being
encouraged to lend their support,
and motions in favour of the
campaign are due to be raised at
Imperial College on the 4th of
November and the The University
of London's Union (ULU) on the
28th of October.
The Institute of Education
believes that present facilities are
inadequate and unaffordable for
many students and staff because of
the University Grants Committee's
unwillingness to allow their funds to
be spend on childcare. They also
believe that this contravenes the
Collegiate council's declaration in
December 1984 that 'no regard
should be taken of a persons race,
sex, age, marital status (and)
number of children' when
appointing university staff.
At present, say the institute,
nursery facilities are badly co-
ordinated with some being over
subscribed whilst others are
underused. The facilities at Imperial
College provide space for forty-
three children from six months to
five years old. About one third of
the users are postgraduates, but the
fee of £42 a week has meant that this
is rarely used by undergraduates
though a grant of £10 per week is
available for a limited number of
users. The waiting time varies from
two months to over a year in the case
of the baby room.
IC Union President Christine
Taig is worried that students with
children will be deterred from
studying at universities because of
the high charges. She feels, in
particular, that more female
students could be encouraged to
enrol at Imperial if the nursery were
less expensive.
Miss Taig will be issuing a
questionnaire on behalf of the child
care campaign at a future date.

Threat To Funding
Research in universities is under
another threat. A secret Cabinet
Committee chaired by Paul
Channon, Secretary of State for
Trade and Industry, has been set up
to find savings on research
expenditure. The Government is
concerned that there is insufficient
control of the money spent by the
universities. In its review of all
research and development
programmes by Government
departments, the committee will be
concentrating on the 'dual support
system' by which the Advisory
Board for the Research Councils
and the Universities Grants
Committee both channel money to
universities for research.
The ABRC provides about £500
million for research development.
The UGC provides £600 which pays
for academic salaries, buildings and
overheads.
Sir David Phillips, chairman of
the ABRC and heading another
inquiry into the UGC supplied
money, said a Guardian interview
that they would have to find out
what the £600 million pays for and
how much of itfindsits way into the
support of programmes which
research councils are also
supporting. 'No one knows how the
£600 million is- spent,' he
commented. He acknowledged that
the money could not be withdrawn
without 'dramatic consequences',
but has already identified £55
million which is an easy target for
transfer; the amount of money given
by the UGC to university
departments which are successful in
attracting research council giants.
The universities will fight
rigorously any attempt to transfer
money to the research councils as, if
such a transfer occurred, research
councils might decide to channel
research money to polytechnics
instead of universities.
