FELIX FELIX, Friday October 17th 1986 18
Gutterpress
by S Leaze
I sometimes think that the
introduction to a gossip column
should run something like a
government health warning—
'Reading gossip can seriously
damage your view of reality'.
Unfortunately, there is a twilight
world of unproveable information
that can't pass as news in the great
and ancient tradition our editor
dreams of upholding. However, if
there were no worth in 'official
rumour' then most of the tabloid
press would be bankrupt inside a
week. The justification then for
"Gutterpress" is essentially
economic rather than moral—give
the proles what they want.
Past FELIX gossip columns have
been especially keen on the
wonderful College administration
who, based in the Sherfield building,
are supposed to keep the place from
falling down around us as we work.
If you were to believe all you read
then you would surmise that what
we have is more of a combination of
Dallas and Yes Minister with
College Secretary John Smith as
some sort of hybrid JR Ewing/Sir
Humphrey figure and the Rector as
an innocently bystanding Minister.
However the new Rector, Prof Ash,
has caused consternation among
some traditionalists by actually
attacking Imperial's problems with
a strong personal commitment.
Furthermore Mr Smith has been
observed being noticeably more
affable toward students which is
leading Smith watchers to believe
something 'big' is brewing.
An interesting development in the
secretary saga is Mr Smith's new
residence, a flat in No 47 Princes
Gardens. This is one of the houses
next to Southside and many people
have wondered why it is not being
converted into more student
accommodation. Well, the answer is
that Mr Smith's time at Imperial will
not continue forever; a year or two is
the unofficial estimate. When John
Smith leaves it will be very difficult
to find a replacement of a similar
calibre, and it is hoped that a South
Kensington home as a 'perk' will
keep suitably experienced outside
candidates in the running for the
job. This will be seen as a great
disappointment to those young
hopefuls already here who dream
about the seat of power and spend
all their time edging themselves
closer to the vital South Corridor on
the 5th floor.
Sadly for some of the desk
dwellers their efforts at ruthless
efficiency have not made them
universally popular. One such,
renowned for his pomposity to
students, is ex-Student Services
officer and current assistant
secretary Michael Arthur. Mr
Arthur has long been known for
emphasising his achievements,
while lounging safely behind a desk,
but one achievement he is playing
down is his monumental cock-up of
the Queens Tower Tourist scheme
this summer. Strangely Michael is
rarely invited to social gatherings
organised by his ex-workplace, next
door to Weeks hall. In fact he may
now have problems in Sherfield
where he was caught relieving
himself behind a pot plant at a
leaving party over summer.
It must be something about
Student Services which finally
cracks people, as evidenced by
current boss Don Ferguson. Don is
so strained by his workload that he
spends long periods of time asleep
behind the closed door of his office,
much to the consternation of the
hard pressed counter staff. At least
he has not suffered the fate of
official College pain in the neck and
Rag Chairman, Man Tai Tseung
who incurred the wrath of some of
the temporary staff during the start
of term accomodation crisis. Man
Tai^ who was unsubtle enough to
have the college Welfare Advisor
covered in shaving foam, and who
has been described as having "the
sensitivity of a potato", was locked
in a cupboard for 15 minutes
because nobody would talk to him.
Well, it's a cruel world and this is a
cruel column!
Last week's problem
I forgot to say that I wanted the year
that the old calenders come from as
well as the dates of the two
birthdays, which made the problem
considerably harder. The most
recent leap year for which January
1st occured on the same day as it did
this year is 1964, which was the year
I was looking for, since one can
assume that both people involved
were born before the war. The
remaining information gave the two
dates as 6th January and 3th
August. The winner was Adrian
Huang, Civ Eng 1, please collect
your £5 after 1.00pm Monday. The
week before's problem—Room
Roulette, the solution was:-
S was in Y's room
T was in U's room
U was in Z's room
V was in W's room
W was in X's room
X was in S's room
Y was in V's room
Z was in T's room
