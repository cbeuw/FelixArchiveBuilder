Football: UC 1st XI 2, IC 1st XI 4
IC Firsts Win Silent
Victory at Shenley
The ban on away supporters seemed
to have expanded from Luton to
Shenley, as the crowd who met
Imperial College's sporting
superstars was, approximately, nil.
Undeterred by the hostile home
crowd, as well as the hostile
atmospheric conditions, IC were
confident of a good performance
and result in this, the first match
against non-IC opposition of the
new seasons.
It seemed, however, that IC were
thinking about lazy summer
afternoons on the beach as UC went
to work, scoring first after 10
minutes. Reaction was instant, and
an IC goal was in the air. After good
work from Simon Cole on the left,
the ball was volleyed home by Nigel
Collier on the edge of the penalty
box. IC continued to dominate a
scrappy and understandably tired
game, but UC regained the lead
after slack work on the IC right.and
the half-time score stayed at 2-1 to
the home team.

Siege At
Harlington
Nine KQC players and three on-
loan IC players took on an IC I XI
on a balmy autumn afternoon at
Harlington. This was the second
friendly of the season and an
important one as IC was to do battle
with KQC in thefirstleague outing
of the season. IC dominated the first
half but Laurence Covin's
spectacular, curling free kick was
the only thing separating the teams
at half time.
IC'S attitude to the second half
was hungrier as they laid siege on
the KQC goal-clinical finishing by
Bill Mason, Bifron Wood, Dave
Lynne and Nigel Collier brought the
score to 5-0 KGC beat the off-side
trap once, 10 minutes from time,
and duly brought the full-time score
to 5-1. IC now go into the UAU
Tournament with a very satisfactory
played 2, won 2.
Team: A Allem, J West, P Ewart,
A Lunghi (Capt), L Covill, B Wood, B
Mason, P Olden, R Dark, D Lynne, M
Collier, Sub M Bradley.
the persistence of Paul Olden were
rewarded in the secondhalf and they
began to dominate the midfield ,
and UC's hard and physical
approach was nonsensed by IC's
smart one-touc h passing game.
Nigel Colier equalised when a
throughball released him and he
cleverly lobbed the oncoming goal
keeper. Paul Olden put the visitor in
front when he tapped in a shot from
the ever present Nigel Collier. He
later completed his hat-trick with 15
minutes to go.
Praise must go to the already
mentioned Coel and Olden, Nigel
Colier for his lethal finishing, and
the central defensive partnership of
Covil and Paul Dyson who were
superb in the second half.
Team: A Allen J West, L Covill, P
Dyson, P Ewart, M Porter, D Olden,

Ladies Rugby: Charing Cross Hospital 4, IC 28
Ladies' Day At
Charing Cross
Last Sunday was the first game of
the season for the Ladies' Rugby
team, and for three-quarters of the
team it was their first game ever.
Despite this, IC rose to the challenge
and ended up with a magnificent 28
points to four win.
The game started slowly with
players finding their way and
gaining confidence to tackle and run
out the opposition. Then after 10
minutes there was a scrum and
scrum half Judith Day released the
ball to fly half Natalie Handler who
managed to run through and pass
the opposition with a series of side
steps and swerves to lay down our
first try. One more try was scored in
the first half.
Charing Cross started the second
half strongly and scored soon after
kick off with a try down the wing.
But this recovery was short lived
and IC managed to beat through
five tries in the second half. Tries
coming from Noreen Haninton,
Judith Day and Natalie Handler
again. Well done to everyone for a
great start to the season, especially
all new players including the two
new centres. Fiona Nicholas and
Jackie Evans.
New players are always welcome
in the Ladies' Rugby team, and no
experience is necessary but anyone
interested should contact Anne
Parsons, Mining Geology 3 or
Natalie Handler, Bio Chem 3.
Sailing, Whitstable: IC vs
Kent University
Kent University
Sunk
On Sunday the IC Sailing team set
off for the first match of the year.
We arrived at their sailing club to
find just two team members and five
boats. Not to be deterred we
suggested two boat team racing with
Richard Brinslow and Gareth
David from IC Sailing for Kent.
The racing went well with IC
winning all races despite
deteriorating conditions as the tide
went out and the water around the
buoys got shallower causing a few
rudder problems.
Rugby, away: IC 1st XV 17,
UCL 1st XV 23
IC 2nd XV 17, UCL 2nd

IC Fall Back
The game was played in very hot
conditions ideal for running rugby.
IC scored first, a penalty try by
Andy Watson which UCL replied to
after another few minutes. Rob
Hargrove went over for thefirsttry
of the season after a series of close-
support passes, finishing with one
from Andy Watson. U C L
capitalised, but then Robin
Bannister went over on the wing for
a try. It was 13-7 to IC at half time.
U C L capitalised after an
interception of a pass, then Mike
Anderson scored after a tricky run
from the 25 yard line to bring the
scores to 17-13 in IC's favour. UCL
drew level after a long period of
pressure, and then their wing scored
a try, which was then converted
making the score 23-17. The match
was scrappy as expected for their
first match of the season, but
prospects for the coming season
look good.
