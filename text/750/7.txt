Felix FELIX, Friday O c t o b e r
In celebration of 750 glorious issues of FELIX, we present a
selection of ramblings for past editors.
Dave Griffin rolls back the years and finds
the English language corrupted by Uncle
Sam
As the 750th appearance of the Cat
comes and goes, I have, as one of
the early Editors, fallen to
pondering on the changes that have
taken place since those dim and
distant days of the mid-50s, when
copy was typed upon manual
typewriters and pasted up on
boards for the Polish photolitho
printer in Earl's Court that we had
forbidden to 'correct' the English
in the copy, even if he was sure it
was wrong.
One sort of change that might
become apparent if one compares
the early issues with the present-sad
to relate, I do not have an example
of either to hand-is the change in
vocabulary. Who would have
known in the 1950s what was meant
by 'macho' 'rip off 'go-go"freebies'
'ID', or would have given 'gay' its
current meaning. If I'd heard tell of
a campus then, I would not have
been sure what it was, but I would
have known it was something to do
with an American University—this
was of course before universities like
East Anglia were built, each having
its own 'campus'. Yes, all these
words have started life somewhere
west of Galway Bay and have since
crossed the Atlantic and made their
home here too. The colonialists
have colonised, and are still doing
so.
Yet there are many Americanisms
that have not (yet?) made the
journey, such as bathroom (for
toilet)or raincheck (a promise of the
same thing at another time),
although they are beginning to be
heard over here—I suppose Dallas
and Dynasty, not to mention
computerspeak, have their
influences. And others that
probably never will, since there are
already well-established British
English words that offer too much
competition, one hopes or perhaps
one should say hopefully (another
one that has been naturalised since
the '50s): to mind come the well
known pairs 'railroad/railway',
'elevator/lift' and 'vest/waistcoat',
or the lesser known 'ride/lift' (in the
hitchhiking sense), 'raise/rise' (of
salaries) and 'faucet/tap' (where
water comes out)
FELIX Editor 1956/57
Most confusion I find are the
words that mean different things on
each side of the pond—vest is one of
them, but a well publicised example.
Not so purse (meaning the whole
handbag, not just the money
container), dormitory (the building
where one sleeps, typically what we
would call a 'hall of residence'), fag
and faggot (homosexual)-leading to
confusing perhaps less for us over
here than for Americans over here in
the context of cigarettes, public
schools and chopped meat
concoctions)! Also, you have to be
very careful not to be misunder-
stood if you tell an American to
keep his pecker up or to ask him to
lend you his rubber!
As a regular visitor to the USA, I
arrive at Chicago O'Hare airport on
a Seven-Forty-Seven airplane,
collect my luggage from the carousel
and put it on a cart, then, after
immigration and Customs, collect
the rented automobile (naturally it
will be with no gearshift and will
have an Illinois license plate), throw
my luggage in the trunk, check that
there is enough gas in the tank,
observe that the windshield is clear
(there are only a couple of decals on
it) and that the muffler is not blown,
back up to come out of the parking
spot and drive off. I get up on the
tollway and head north. But it's
slow going since the pavement is
under repair, made worse by the
presence of a number of semis in the
line I'm in. But things soon clear and
I can hit 55, the national speed limit.
Before long I stop at an oasis where I
visit the bathroom and perhaps grab
a brat and a soda (but certainly not
any root beer!)
At Rockford, Illinois I look into
the Time Museum attached to a
motel just off the interstate, and am
gratified to see among the books in
the museum shop a couple of titles
(on astronomy) by another former
FELIX Editor, my contemporary
Robin Kerrod. I eventually reach
the beltway of Madison, Wisconsin
(The beltway is of course a divided
highway, i.e. a highway with a
median) and head for downtown. I
might be stopping in a university
dorm or may be visiting with friends
in their condo that they have just
brought not too near a railroad
crossing. They coment that their
realtor was 'real good' (pun?!), and
point out that the yard had been in a
well-cared for state when they had
moved in.
I've now ceased to be puzzled at
the terminology of classifying
undergraduates according to where
they are in the four(!) years of their
course of study as freshmen (never
'Freshers'), sophomores, juniors
and seniors or at the system of
assistant, asssociate, and full
professors (where we have lecturers,
readers and professors); the term
faculty (to signify the university
teaching staff) has I think now
successfully made the crossing. I am
still a little confused about
semesters-in theory, the two halves
into which the academic year is
divided, as compared with our three
terms, but they seem to have
summer session in addition.
What takes a bit of getting used to
is the different pronunciation of
several words-not the different
'accent' but a difference within their
framework of sound values as
compared with what we say in our
parallel system (is this what the
linguists would call a difference in
phonems as opposed to
allophones?). Well known ones are
'tomatoes' (rhyming with 'potatoes'
and 'either' (rhyming with 'ether'),
but also 'solder', which is
pronounced 'sodder', a herb is an
'erb' and 'basil'-
is 'base-ill'.In
proper names, 'Elgin' becomes
' Elj in' and 'Brynmawr' is
'Brinmore' (for the non-Welsh
among you, it should be
pronounced 'Brin-ma-oor'!) -these
are places in the USA, presumably
called after the originals over here.
Of course the French must really
squirm when they hear the places
'Des Plaines' and 'Notre Dame'
pronounced as English words, but
there is a nod in the Freeh direction
with 'Des Moines' which is said to
rhyme with 'sirloin'; however,
anyway it's been a very long time
since the French heard 'Detroit '
said as it orginally was (de triot)'
Then there is the changing stress
in words such as adull, where we say
adult, and /Moratory
Also, the subtle changes in the use
of words, such as using a verb
transitively where we would use it
intrasitively, like 'protest' they say
'The students protest the cut in
grants'. As a matter of fact, we too
use 'protest' their innocence, but
over there they protest their
conviction!
And the different use of
abbreviations; chrysanthemums are
mums, whereas 'refrigerator' is not
abbreviated-but you often hear it
called what it once was: the icebox;
and a cooker is always a stove.
But I could go on (this is a 750th
issue guest corner not a series) OK,
suffice to recall what Mark Twain is
said to have remarked on being told
that American was a mere
aberration of English; 'The King's
English is not the King's. It is ajoint
stock company and America owns
most of the shares'.
