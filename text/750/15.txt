New Model Army - The Ghost of
Cain
I wasn't sure whether I liked New
Model Army or not until I heard
their new album. I first saw them
when they played at an IC freshers'
do several years ago. At that point
they were making a noise
suspiciously like a heavy rock band
while sitting around with a lot of
other groups in the rather outdated
category of "New Wave". Since
signing to EMI in October 1984
their excellent single "No Rest" has
taken them beyond the Indie charts,
where they have had consistent hits.
With luck "The Ghost of Cain" will
turn them into a big enough success
for their controversial ban from the
United States to be overcome.
N M A are not the sort of band
who dither around with lyrics and
statements. Perhaps it is not so
surprising that occasionally they
have a clash with the authorities -
like the IBA who banned their single
"Vengeance". At the same time, it is
difficult to argue with the
uncompromising nature of "Only
stupid bastards take heroin" or the
lyrics of "Western Dream", a song
which sounds like a direct attack on
the commercial policy of Top of the
Pops. Don't get the impression that
N M A are just some post-punk
power combo though. The tracks
"Lovesongs" and "Ballad", and the
harmonica of Mark Feltham from
"Nine Below Zero" make this a very
varied, though not variable, album.
Producer Glyn Jones has worked
for Led Zepplin, The Who, The
Rolling Stones, The Clash, Joan
Armatrading and many more, and
you can take him as a fair guarantee
of rock credibility.
This record will certainly get a
vote from me as one of the year's top
ten albums. In fact I'd go along with
the press release which says "Britain
in the 1980s has for the most part got
the music it deserves; bland,
unchallenging and unoriginal.
NEW MODEL A R M Y are a major
part of the opposition."

The Rose of Avalanche,
Velveteen,
Fire Records.
The eagerly awaited second single
by the Rose? I hadn't heard of The
Rose, before, but apparently their
previous single made it to the Indie
top 5. Velveteen is a bouncy little
track, with a very sixties guitary feel
to it, not unlike the Velvet
Underground. Despite one or two
well worn tricks, I quite like it. I
won't rave about it, but I'll play it
again.
The Rose will be playing the
Town and Country Club, Kentish
Town on 2nd November.

'Boomtown'
A&M records
The Davids' boomtown is a
desperate place. A place where the
cocaine is in the dresser, and you
pick your own habits (they've got
plenty to go around). A place full of
disillusion, where money makes a
succulent sound. So this is
Hollywood, complete with
sportscase, cocaine, casual sex and,
of course, money. Unlike Ellis' glib
best seller 'Less than Zero' which
glorified the L.A. Highlife, this
record paints a colder picture. Even
over the sparkling new wavish score,
this sounds as jaded and streetwise
as even Tom Waits at his most
probing.
'So welcome to my boomtown'
The tunes of 'Boomtown' generally
avoid the tiresome formulae used by
some of their contemporaries. A
standard line-up of guitar, bass,
drums and synth parts that enhance
rather than overwhelm, takes up
through progressions and melodies
which are remarkably fresh and
inventive-if a little American. David
Baerwald's voice, wrecked by
cigarettes, Springsteen with a sore
throat (to my mind the best way to
hear Springsteen), whilst David
Rickett the composer mercifully
avoids the temptation of becoming a
'gee-tar' hero in the American
tradition. I liked it.
