Sabbaticals FELIX Friday October 17th 1986 4
Union Cards Grabbed
The past week in the office has been
full of horrible non-stop queries
about parking permits, gym
bookings and Union cards. Parking
permits and bookings have now
been distributed, if you feel you've
missed out we're sorry, it's a difficult
task trying to allocate scarce
resources like these when there are
hundreds of worthy causes. As for
the union cards, we haven't got any
left because they were stolen. If you
need a student card you can still get
a University of London Union card
which will allow you to use facilities
here and in other Colleges.
Council
The council meeting on Monday
night was good in at least two
respects; firstly that it was well
attended and secondly that it was
short. Council is the 'managing
body' of the Union; consisting of 46
Union Officers, at least one of
whom represents you. If you have
never heard of council or didn't
know you were represented on it,
ask your departmental rep-
resentative about it.
Council makes decisions which
the Sabbaticals and other officers
should abide by, for example, the
views and ideas they should take to
College, the way they should spend
money, and action they should take
on internal and external affairs.
Minutes of this meeting will be
posted publicly in a week or so.
One of the issues raised at Council
was that of the Deputy President's
job, which, since the takeover of the
bar and snack bar, has become too
much for one person. The workload
on Jen, the Union's permanent
administrator, is also ridiculously
large. We are therefore setting up a
'working party' (though I hate to
use the phrase) to decide how the
work should be re-distributed,
possibly by taking on another
sabbatical. Anyone interested in the
Union re-organisation, whether or
not you're a Council member or
'Officer', can take part see Jackie or
myself in the Union Office.
Get Involved
There are a few places on Union and
College committees still empty.
These is 1) one place on the Union
External Affairs committee, which
deals with all things relevant to
students but not specific to Imperial
e.g. grant campaigns, accomm-
odation, etc; 2) one place on the
Union House Committee which
allocates money for the upkeep of
the Union Building and other Union
rooms; 3) two places on the College
radiation safety committee, which
deals with radiation problems
throughout the whole college, and
4) one place on the reactor safety
committee which, like the reactor, is
based at Silwood park.
If anyone has a special interest in
any of thesefieldswould like to get
involved, let me know. Remember
that the posts of Welfare Officer and
Publicity Officer of the Union are
still vacant; papers are up in the
Union Building ground floor. To
stand, you need a proposer and ten
seconders; election will take place at
the UGM on 4th November. Any
questions - come and ask us.
Finally
All the Rockers amongst you get
down to the Union tomorrow...live
band (featuring the meanest bass
player since Norman Jardine), rock
disco and cheap booze..see you
there.

The World Outsid
One of the most important aspects
of this wonderful democracy thing
we're supposed to have is the
electoral system. It affects YOU and
it is important that you should be
sure you have a vote. The next
edition of the electoral register for
the country is being compiled at this
very moment. The initial deadline
for registering has in fact past but
this doesn't mean you will be
excluded. If you live in College Halls
and Houses your name should have
been automatically submitted for
the local constituencies. Also you
may well be registered at your home
address as a postal voter, this
needn't stop you being registered
here as you can choose which
constituency to vote in for national
elections and you are entitled to
votes in both for some local
elections.
If you are unsure whether you are
on the new register or not then the
draft version should be available for
checking at local council offices
from November 28th. You then
have until December 16th to correct
any omission. As long as you are
over 18 and a British or Irish citizen
then there is no reason for you to be
omitted from the register (certainly
not if you are a student here).
Remember this could be your last
chance to have a say in the next
general election, it affects YOU
NOW!
On another matter concerning
rights, in a few weeks time there will
be a week of events in college
devoted to publicising and raising
money for campaigns against
human rights abuse. Although
much of the material you will see
will be from political clubs and
societies, humanrightsis essentially
a non-political issue. Much of the
organisation is done by Amnesty
International whose apolitical
status is regulated by their
relationship to organisations such as
the UN. As a prelude to Human
Rights Week, I am producing a
special centre section for FELIX
and I would welcome any
contributions from people
concerned with particular cases of
denial of human rights or general
campaigns in thisfield.Please try to
spare some time and effort for this
special event, there are people out
there in the real world dying and
suffering repulsive agonies for
whom you may be the only hope.
