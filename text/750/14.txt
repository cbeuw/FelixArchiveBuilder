Les Liasons Dangereuses seems
destined to be the next fight-for-a-
ticket show in the West End,
continuing in the tradition of its
RSC predecessor Les Miserables.
Therefore those who like to be
culturally up-to-date should hastily
beat a track to the Ambassadors'
Box Office as ticket sales are already
soaring.
Rightly so; the play by
Christopher Hampton (of Savages
fame) is a fine theatrical piece which
deals with decadence and 'sexual
liberalism' in 18th century France,
being based on a scandalous novel
of the period by Laclos. The
performance has style, assurance
and a considerable amount of
humour, bawdy and otherwise,
without amounting to more farce.
The acting is strong all round,
Lindsay Duncan and Simon
Matticks bring intelligent polished
villainy to their two leading
characters whilst playing up to the
deeper, more psychological side of
the plays, which runs beneath the
plot in a manner one might expect
from modern French cinema.
However, one cannot but be
entertained by this thoroughly
unpleasant story of two dissolute
aristocrats corrupting a young
convent girl (Beatie Edney from
Highlander), and the fine details of
the production- the set, the
menacing incidental music and the
choreographed dramatics of the
close are all particularly pleasing.
Should be seen. A modern play in
many senses.

For those of us, like me, whose
knowledge of poetry extends to the
Faber book ofNursery Ryhmes, Nine
Not so Modern Poets or The Oxford
Book of Longer Boring Poems, I
decided to examine the works of
three poets, all male, all dead, all
Western, I'm afraid: Tennyson,
Betjeman and Eliot
Tennyson was very definitely a
son of the nineteenth Century whose
poetry went tumity-tumity-tumit-
tumit and rhymed in all the right
places. His poems may have a
slightly depressing effect; he wrote
about death, usually glorious
(Charge of the Light Brigade) or the
pangs of despised love (Locksley
Hall), and also tended to prefer
romantic themes, like King Arthur,
or the death in battle of Sir Richard
Grenville. In fact it's probably only
because we are used to pretentious
verse that has no rhyme or rhythm
and lines of all different lengths that
Sir Alfred Tennyson's seems dated.
Anyway, here are some samples so
that you can judge for yourself.
When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;
Saw the Vision of the World and all the wonder that would be-
In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;
In the Spring the wanton Lapwing gets himself another crest;
In the Spring a livelier Iris changes to the burnish'd dove;
In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love
Both Betjeman and Tennyson were
Poet Laureates, and both wrote
poesy with rhyme and meter, but
there the resemblance ends.
Betjeman is a lot more modern and
therefore accessible, and writes
about more ordinary happening.
He is unashamedly middle-class
in both subjects and outlook but can
nevertheless lampoon the snobbish
narrow-mindedness of his own
breed in poems such as In
Westminster Abbey:
Gracious Lord, Oh bomb the Germans.
Spare their women for thy sake,
And if that is not too easy
We will pardon Thy Mistake.
But gracious Lord, Whate'er shall be,
Don't let anyone bomb me.
Many of his poems are concerned
with architecture, and quite a few
with women; at school we were all
convinced he was a Dirty Old Man.
Others are in a kind of gentle, rose-
coloured spectacle mode, like Upper
Lambourne, about a major race-
horse training village.
Up the ash-tree climbs the ivy,
Up the ivy climbs the sun,
With a twenty thousand pattering,
Has a valley breeze begun.
Feathery ash, neglected elder,
Shift the shade and make it run.
T.S. Eliot is the most pretentious of
the three writers, more modern in
style if not in date than Betjeman.
He believed that poetry had been
made 'too easy' for people to
understand, and to remedy this put
into his lots of obscure Greek words
and underlying metaphors. When
not showing off, his poetry is
extremely lyrical and beautiful;
April is the cruellist month, breeding
Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.
Eliot also wrote plays in verse,
one of which, Murder in the
Cathedral, is especially lovely. This
explores the theme of conflict
between temporal and spiritual
power (or servitude) enacted in the
murder of Thomas a Beckett. This is
a bit like a Greek tragedy in format-
there is a chorus of the women of
Canterbury, and all violent doings
are separate from the narrative.

Flash'd all their sabres bare,
Flash'd as they turn'd in air,
Sabring the gunners there,
Charging an army, while,
All the world wonder'd
Plunged in the battery-smoke
Right thro' the line they broke;
Cossack and Russian
Reel'dfrom the sabre-stroke
Shatter'd and sunder'd.
Then they rode back, but not,
Not the six hundred.

You know, and do not know, what it is to act or suffer.
You know and do not know, that action is suffering,
And suffering action. Neither does the agent suffer
Nor the patient act. But both are fixed
In an eternal action, an eternal patience.
To which all must consent that it may be willed
And which all must suffer that they may will it,
That the pattern may subsist, that the wheel may turn
and still
Be forever still.
And on that note, goodbye.
