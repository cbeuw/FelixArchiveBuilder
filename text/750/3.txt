Kitchen Blues
Residents of Tizard Hall have
written to the Managing Surveyor of
Residences, Mr Peter'Hallworth,
complaining about the kitchen
arrangements in the Hall. They are
concerned that no improvements
have been made since September
1985.
Last year it was decided that the
laundry rooms of Tizard and
Selkirk Halls would be converted to
kitchens in order to reduce the
conjestion in their existing facilities.
Mr Hallworth had originally
intended to convert bedrooms on
each staircase into kitchens and to
convert the existing kitchens into
bedrooms. This plan was rejected by
the Tizard and Selkirk committees
because of the disruption involved
and because they felt that the
kitchens would be noisy and smelly.
Falmouth Keough Hall, however,
elected to introduce the staircase
kitchens. Members of Tizard and
Selkirk committees have suggested
that Mr Hallworth is waiting for the
residents to be persuaded by the
success of the Falmout Keogh
facilities. The Tizard committee still
rejects this idea as it would involve
either turning students out of their
rooms or delaying the kitchens for
another year.
Broken
Window
Students from Richmond College
have been banned from using IC
Union rooms following rowdy
behaviour in the Union Lounge.
The College, which is for American
and other overseas students, had
booked the room for a "Hawaiian
Beach Party" last Friday. Several
complaints were received about
noise, including one from Dr
Finlay, the Warden of Beit Hall,
which resulted in the party being
closed half an hour early.
"The students brought in a lot of
alcohol and left a great deal of
mess," said Deputy President,
Jackie Pierce, adding that the bar
staff were considering closing the
bar because of their drunken
behaviour.
Later in the evening one of the
students threw a bottle through a
window in Biochemistry, and more
disturbance was caused when they
were left waiting in Beit Quad for
three-quarters of an hour when one
of their coaches failed to arrive on
time.
The cost of replacing the window
of £30 will be taken from Richmond
College's deposit.
Famine Talk
Mary Wright, a field worker for
Third World First spoke on 'The
true causes of famine' at their
meeting last Friday. Mrs Wright
explained that exploitation of good
soil for the growth of cash crops,
such as tea, by multinationals was
pushing peasants out onto more
marginal land. She commented that
overpopulation was not such a large
problem as it had been made out to
be and that Third World countries
could feed themselves if they were
allowed to control their own
resources. "For a subject as
important as this, it was
dissapointing that the meeting was
so poorly publicised and attended",
said one observer.
University
Funding
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors
and Principals is urging the
government to act to halt the decline
in universities' funding. The
committee is also pressing for higher
salaries for academics "We realise
that we can't mean competitive
salaries, but we mean a reasonable
salary", they stated. Professor
Maurice Shock, chairman of the
committee, said that funding of
universities would drop by one-
third in this decade if nothing was
done. As a result not only is the
education of prospective students
threatened but also the future of
Britain's basic research-a main
purpose of the universities. Prof
Shock warned that in the end "the
medical schools which underpin the
health service will slowly decay."
Salary increase and resturing the
academic profession would cost
£170 million, while stablising
university funding at 1986/87 levels
would require a further £80-130
million.
Aphrodisiac Teas
The Union Snack Bar Manager
Norman Jardine has introduced a
new range of 'aphrosdisiac teas'.
"Ordinary tea is slow suicide",
explained a very laid back customer,
his eyes still dilating from a cup of
.'orange dazzler'.
In an exclusive FELIX interview,
Norman pointed out that he had
always wanted to introduce unusual
teas, but has only recently found a
reasonably priced supplier. He
reckons that the novel teas will
prove very popular, especially after
the recent articles in the Guardian
and Standard which extolled their
virtues.
Video Art
The University of London's
interactive video network 'Live-net'
was unveiled on Monday at a
demonstration in the Sherfield
Building. It was hoped that the
system, a prototype of a British
Telecom design, will be fully
operational by October 1987,
enabling intercollegiate seminars
and conferences to take place.
The network allows simultaneous
audio visual communication on a
maximum of four channels so that
five way conversations can take
place 'over the television'. At the
moment Imperial College, Senate
House and University College have
links to the network, and King's and
Queen Mary Colleges are due to be
connected by the end of November.
At present the tea is only sold at
lunch times. Four flavours are
available with more on the way,
'orange dazzler' being the most
sought after. Norman can vouch for
the tea's aphrodisiac qualities from
his own personal experience. "Since
I started drinking it I've been up all
the time", he said.

Sabbaticals
On The Way
A working party has been set up to
consider increasing the number of
sabbatical posts. In her report to
council on Monday, Union Deputy
President Jackie 'Pence suggested
that five full-time officers were
needed now that the Union Snack
Bar and Union Bar are under Union
control.
Rector's Wife
Opens Lift
Mrs Eric Ash, the Rector's wife,
opened a new passenger lift in
Biochemistry last Friday. This lift
replaces the old paternoster system
of continually moving platforms, on
which a man was killed last year.
The lift installation was carried out
by E R S Lift and Elevators Ltd
under the supervision of Mr John
James who is the Electrical Engineer
at IC.
