Model of Statue of Liberty
A plaster model of the Statue of Liberty (about
one foot high and painted red) was removed
from the exhibition level 2 of Sherfield Building.
This model is an essential part of Keith Waters'
Ph.D project and he cannot remake it since all
work is based on this original piece.
Will the person who took the model please
return it so that Keith Waters can complete his
Ph.D.
If anyone has any information about the model
please contact Dr G. Hargreaves (Tel 3046) or
Mr Reeves-(The Security Officer. Tel 3371.
