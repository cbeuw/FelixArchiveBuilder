Felix FELIX, Friday October 17th 1986 8
A S i c k University
by
David Rowe
FELIX Editor 1984/5
You must known that Imperial
College is a swamp of fear and
loathing. The year is 1994, the
1000th issue of FELIX has just
thudded on your doormat; it is the
beginning of another Friday at the
sick university.
Successive administrations by
application of the principles of
caring capitalism have eroded state-
funded education almost entirely.
The Science and Engineering
Research Council exist to distribute
funds from industry now, not from
government. The SERC looks for
glamorous research fields,
overfunds them for a few years, and
then transfers the funding
elsewhere. Academics are
constantly changing their research
fields to make them appear more
glamourous. Erstwhile colla-
borators now take evil pleasure in
The Senior Assistant
Undersecretary for Data
Processing
sabotaging one another's work.
Projects rarely get completed.
Things are not much better in the
old Sherfield building either. True,
the administrators are still funded
by the government but they haven't
escaped unscathed.
Job titles are changed nearly
every week to fit in with the latest
buzzwords (and to justify the
continued employment of Jack, the
man who paints people's names on
their doors).
No one dares to exchange
pleasantries in the corridor, or reply
to letters for fear that it will be
thought that they don't have enough
work to do.
Office juniors hope to obtain
promotion by writing to the Rector
to tell him that they can do their own
job plus that of their boss 'and
wouldn't it be a good idea to....' The
administration responds by
changing the boss's job title, moving
him sideways, and giving him
nothing to do in the hope that he will
get fed up and go away. People don't
resign or get sacked. They just drift
away.
Of course most of the power in
the Sherfield building lies with the
data processing manager, or
'principal second secretary with
responsibilitiy for information
systems'. The administration thrives
on disinformation, half-truths and
downright lies, most of which are
circulated by electronic means, from
one department to another. The
data processing department adds to
the fun by 'losing' parts of the data
from time to time. Vast armies of
temporary secretaries are then
engaged by the personel department
to type all the data in again.
In a rare stroke of genius the
refectory was closed down last year,
and a franchise awarded to
MacDonald's ('a long established
family firm with a fine tradition of
sponsorship of research in the
artificial food faculty') The old
refectory staff have been redeployed
on the Star Wars project.
The assistant third secretary
(exploitation of American tourists)
has had the tunnels under the
College renovated at a cost of £65
million. 'See the tower and the
tunnels for an all-in, once-and-for-
all, unrepeatable £25.'
As the administration has grown
larger and larger it has been deemed
necessary for more and more of the
senior staff to be found flats and
accommodation on campus. Pairs
of rooms in Southside have been
knocked into one to make flats for
administrators; the demand for
these rooms is so great that there are
interesting plans to build a new hall
of residence, possibly to be sited on
top of the sports centre in Princes
Gardens.
Alarmed by this prophetic vision
of the future, dear student? No need
to be. The teaching of
undergraduates has been farmed
out to private contractors at
Cranfield. Students have no place in
the sick university.

(Editor 1974/75) wastes
some ink
Dear Mr. Editor,
Yes indeed, I see your problem
only too clearly. Poor you. FELIX
issue no. 750 on the horizon and
doodly squat of interest to publish.
So you've contacted lots of Ex-
editors to bail you out with self-
indulgent drivel that should never
see the light of day. You poor
miserable bugger.
Has it never dawned on you that
ex-Editors of FELIX cannot be
trusted within half-a-mile of pen
and paper any more? That the
merest sniff of a copy deadline is
enough to send them stark staring
bonkers? So that they start
repeating themselves? Repeating
themselves?
And sometimes they start to think
they are two people! (Both of us are
quite adamant about this).
That's when the exclamation
marks start appearing out of the!
blue!.
Then the spelling in the artykel

Hugh Southey (Editor
1985/86) writes about
being a fruitcake
Four months ago Dave Jones asked
me to write something on a topic of
my choice to celebrate the 750th
issue. Sounds easy doesn't it? It isn't
though. When you have the
opportunity to write about anything
nothing seems appropriate.Dave
suggested that I should write about
being engaged. I am sure most of
you don't want to be bored by a
slushy tribute to your Deputy
President (she is wonderful you
know). Anyway those of you who
were here last year when I was
Editor will have read enough boring
drivel in my editorials so I'll keep it
short. I'd just like to say that I'm
pleased that FELIX has managed
750 issues. I hope it manages to stay
as the most readable publication at
IC for another 750 issues. It is very
satisfying to see 4000 copies
disappear on Friday morning.
Finally I hope Dave hides this
article somewhere so that nobody
reads it.
Keep the Cat Free
Hugh.
