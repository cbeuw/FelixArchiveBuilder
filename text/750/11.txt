Of
A torrid tale of terrible
torment. Any resemblance to
persons living or dead is
purely coincidental.
They came to Cheapskate on a warm
rose coloured afternoon. The leaves in
the gardens rustled as if to warn them of
the bleak winter ahead.
She got out of the car, clutching her
books, her cooking pots and her
teddy—who had been a friend for so
many years.
Tearful parents waved her
goodbye—goodbye for the last time to
the most precious thing in their lives.
She sat alone in her room, filled with a
curious mixture of awe, intense
excitement and a terrible sense of loss.
She expected so much from her new
home, her mind hungry, eager to
explore and discover. She sat upright,
like a flower at its moment of perfection.
Meanwhile in another part of
Cheapskate John Secretary, the
Baron's former right hand man fondly
remembered what life was like when old
Baron Weed was around. Then
Cheapskate was the jewel in the
nation's crown and John Secretary had
been the most powerful and influential
man in Cheapskate.
This most honourable of men, now
grey and withered, no longer had any
control of this once great kingdom,
By
J u v e n a l
which he saw crumbling around his
ears.
But on the bright side, the new
Baron, Derek Dash, had promoted
John Secretary. He now had the
supremely important and responsible
task of standing on his head wiggling his
legs in the air—which he was doing
now.
At that moment Derek Dash burst
into John Secretary's dungeon. In he
ran, fresh faced and eager on heat,
sporting his new squash kit.
"Hi John," said Dash in his cultivated
transatlantic accent.
"Good afternoon Baron," said John
Secretary with all the poise and dignity
his posture would allow." "Do you have
any more tasks for me today?", he
asked.
"Fraid so John me old cheroot," said
Dash. "I have some important
industrialists visiting from that cess pit
north of Watford. I want to sell them
another part of Cheapskate."
"Yes," said John Secretary excitedly,
wiggling his legs in the air.
In another part of the kingdom, the
new Falix Editor, Rabid Bones, was in a
particularly bad mood. As well as his
usual burdens, Rabid had to cope with
the loathsome former Falix Editors
popping into his office to contribute
their miserable articles for his
anniversary issue.
Rabid was a mean son of a bitch. He
never smiled, he whipped his staff
regularly and kicked a dog to death
once a week. Rabid thought he'd
become a mean son of a bitch faster
than most of the old Falix Editors
because he was far more intelligent
than them, but really it was because
Falix was rapidly sucking the life out of
him.
Will the student ever reach the stars?
Will John Secretary regain his
honour?
Will Rabid ever become a proper
human being again?
read the answer to these questions
and many more in the next thrilling
episode of The Baron of
Cheapskate.

No. 23: Pallab Ghosh,
Professional Paranoid.
Last Sunday two men in Reykjavik
killed peace. So the media said. The
truth is that two business men couldn't
work out a deal on how many times
they need to kill us all.
Those at Imperial College, a centre of
academic excellence, smugly distance
themselves from such hippocrisy. But
now the idea of independent academic
centres of excellence seems as far in the
past as the Edwardian ideals that
spawned it.
The smart-suited smoothy from
industry is now coming to the rescue of
ailing universities with his magic cheque
book. And with him comes the big
compromise. As industry starts getting
its hands on universities it starts
becoming part of the problem rather
than part of the solution. For what
industry wants—with share holders
breathing down its neck—is a fast buck.
Thus, inevitably, resources are
diverted away from blue-sky and
socially conscious research to areas
that make the fastest return on outlay.
Once academic institutions start
becoming fast buck factories the
atmosphere within them changes.
Profits take precedence over
excellence and an environment
devoted to cultivating minds becomes
one which turns people into money-
making machines.
"But we have to face realities," is the
retort from College administrators,
"the money has to come from
somewhere." Such an attitude is the
attitude of a balance sheet mentality.
Balance sheet mentalities on the
University Grants Committee have
sold academia down the river—or more
precisely, to Reagan's Star Wars effort.
