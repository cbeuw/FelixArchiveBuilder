THE INDEPENDENT
FELIX media watcher Andy Vickers
reviews the launch of Fleet Street's
newcomer
Tuesday 7th October saw the launch
of the first new quality British
newspaper since that of FELIX in
1949. To meet this challenge,
Andrew Vickers set out to give it a
bad review. Here are his findings:
As I was unable to buy a copy of
The Independent on itsfirstday, I
watched that evening's news reports
on T.V. Of the new newspaper's
circulation, the following facts were
quoted:
1) The launch print run of The
Independent was 600,000.
2) This number was sold out by
lunchtime.
3) The same run will be used on
the second day and until demand
falls off.
4) Target run is 400,000, which
has been exceeded temporarily.
5) This target is lower than the
other three quality papers, whose
circulation is approximately:
Telegraph 1.1 million
Guardian 500,000
Times 450,000
Comments on The Independent
from other Fleet Street editors did
little to help me form my own
opinion.
Max Hastings of The Telegraph
called it "informed but dull". Others
were reluctant to admit that it came
up to the standard of the 'big three'.
None the wiser, I vowed to buy one
on Wednesday morning.
Having managed to find a copy,
my second objective was to see if it
really was independent, so I read the
political news. The complete page
dedicated to the Tory party
conference seemed a good place to
start. Party Chairman Norman
Tebbit's speech was quoted in
summary - no comments, as was
Education Secretary Kenneth
Baker's - no comment.
The same was true of the orations
of John Mayor (Minister for Social
Security), John Patten (Housing)
and Norman Lamont (Treasury).
Even a tiny item about Avon
County Council refusing leave to
the allegedly racist teacher,
Jonathan Savery, for attending the
conference contained no comments.
OK, fine. I wondered about juice,
scandal, muck. Was there any? Not
until I read the centre pages. The
title of these pages was "Media" -
appropriate I suppose, as most of
the sordid revelations of the
national press are sensationalised by
Fleet Street anyway. Articles had
been written on the Wyman-Smith
affair and the subsequent
commercialisation of Mandy Smith,
City Limits magazine, Neil Kinnock
and the "capitalist" press (The
Independent is owned by a
consortium of city wizards) and a
comment (yes - a comment) on
racist advertising.
My conclusion was that these
centre pages were not quite
politically independent - they could
have been printed on pink paper.
The next focus of my attention
was the editorial. Under the title
"The best form of defence",
Secretary of State George Younger
was warned of the impending
collapse of Conservative defence
policy. A retreat from the Falkland
Islands was suggested as the least
unpalatable method of cutting
expenditure. Although this looks
like an attack on government policy,
it ended by saying that Labour and
the Alliance defence policies were
even more unstable.
Under the title "Third World
Follies", phrases like "The
irrepressible Mr M Bow",
"Autocratic stewardship",
"political patronage", "repressive
states" and "block of non-
democratic states" stuck out like
sore thumbs. But then the point of
this rant was not an attack on the
activities of UNESCO and its
leadership, but more a note of
congratulation to Britain for
stepping out and staying out of that
"club".
So far the editorial has been left of
centre of the right (?). However,
under "Fair's Fair Shares" the
inhabitants of that Mecca of all true
capitalists - the city - were labelled as
marauding sharks. Predictably on
this issue (privatisation), the
Government came off badly.
In summary then, the editorial
has had a go at every party
(including the Alliance) and so
could easily be called 'independent'.
Two games of badminton in the
last four years will not make me a
candidate for sportsman of the year.
Similarly, 2'/2 pages of sport out of
32 will not earn a nomination for
sports paper of the year. That aside,
the sports coverage was wide and
informative. Hardly inspired, but
nonetheless interesting. I'll leave it
at that.
The pages of business news were
good. News of mergers, prices,
money markets, profits, unit trusts,
cutbacks and law were good. The
City may welcome The Independent
as an adequate supplement to the
Financial Times, and possibly as a
replacement for The Times.
Finally, my overall opinion of
The Independent is good. Although
political comments are made
(though rarely), they are balanced. I
believe that it will make a worthy
rival to the big three, and will
probably become one of the new big
four. With a three week money back
offer (issue 2, page 26),who could
fail to give it a chance. To its staff I
say "Best of luck"
