Cross Country Club:
Wombling
With Hare and
Hounds
The first race of the season, a
friendly with Thames Hare and
Hounds was held on Wimbledon
Common last Saturday. Despite the
glorious weather and scenery, once
again it was only regulars who
turned out. We were soundly
beaten, though it was a very
enjoyable afternoon with tea cakes
provided until the pubs opened.
Details of future races are on the
noticeboard to the right of the main
stairs on the ground floor of the
union Building.
Rugby: IC 'A' Team 52,
School of Slavonic and
Eastern European Studies 7
Brave Defence
As the scoreline suggests, this was a
fairly one-sided match. However,
SSEES never stopped trying, and
they got one try after some good
commitment, when the IC pack was
in their 'let's go for a stroll' mood.
Towards the end of the match, the
pressure was too much for them (42
points scored after half-time) and
the IC Backs ran some great trys.
Badminton, Mixed Ham-
mersmith League Div. 3: IC
lost 6:3.
Panic In
Hammersmith
Our debut in the Hammersmith
League was also marked by the first
blunder of the season. Through
some rare miscalculation, the match
secretary managed to arrange two
matches on the same night. Needless
to say, there was incredible panic
and the club captain and team
captain tried to sort things out.
In the other matches IC were
beaten 6:3.
Science Fiction
Hyena Offal
Something I have always wondered
about is what makes people go into
Science and Technology and end
up in a place like Imperial.ls it the
love of the large pay cheques that
graduates receive? (Only if you go
into accountancy!) Is it the
pioneering spirit of working on the
edge of human knowledge? (That
certainly doesn't apply here). Or is it
just a way to get letters after your
Industrial
Bread & Fishes
I've heard tell that it is possible to
feed 5000 people on 5 loaves and 3
fish. Couldn't have been easy. The
Indsoc 'Get Together' took 160
french loaves, 30 granary loaves,
108 lbs of cheese and 140 litres of
wine, provided with the help of
Sainsbury's. It was of course the
french loaves which caused the
trouble. Sainsbury's weren't ready
for the size of our order, despite
being warned, and had to start
baking rapidly. This took an extra
two hours and left us with but one
hour to prepare the food in College.
It was a mammoth task and no
mistake, though by the end of the
day Indsoc had obtained a
membership of just over 400, which
makes it all worth it.
So now if you have joined Indsoc,
all you have to do is come to a few of
our events. The Saatchi and Saatchi
Speaker Meeting on the 21st (next
Tuesday) would be a good one to
start with. It is at lunch-time,
starting at 12.40 p.m., but you can
get something to eat at the informal
buffet afterwards. Come along to
Chem Eng Lt 1 on the day and
discover advertising. Also next
week is the Price Waterhouse
business game on the Wednesday.
Get in touch with Trevor Power in
Mech Eng 3 for more information,
but hurry.
If you want to join Indsoc, it costs
£1.50, after which all events are free.
Send a cheque made out with your
name & department to Trevor
Power's pigeon hole (once again)
and he will send your membership
card by return of post.
Alternatively, join at the speaker
meeting.
name and I.C.'s good because you
end up with four extra letters free of
charge? Whatever the conscious
reasons, there are doubtless many
subconcious reasons lurking in the
background explaining why you
chose a certain subject. I suspect
that many people in college first
came upon the idea of science in the
pages of some piece of science-
fiction they read as children, and
that it has not been insignificant in
your final choice of career.
Whether this is true or a
complete pile of hyena offal, it
serves as a useful introduction to
this description of what SFSOC is
actually getting up to. We are a very
varied club and our members can
get involved to any degree they
want. At the very highest end we
arrange visits to SF conventions
and gatherings, write stories and,
soon, will produce a magazine. Any
submissions would be most
welcome. For those people who still
like reading science fiction, and it
really isn't all ray guns, spaceships
and chromed robots and all, we
have a large library from which
books may be borrowed. This is
open every Thursday lunchtime
and is situated on the top floor of the
Union Building. If you want to read
SF cheaply or can't find the book
you want in the shops, feel free to
come along and join us.
In all our activities though we like
to enjoy ourselves and there's
nothing quite like a good all-action
film for that. Our film shows are how
most people get to meet SFSOC
and we've got a cracking one lined
up for Tuesday. Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Doom will
start at 7 p.m. in Mech Eng 220 on
Tuesday 21st October, entrance
50p for members and £1.50 for non-
members, which includes SFSOC
membership. It's a fantastic film and
I hope to see lots of you there. Till
then, share and enjoy!
Rag
Collect £200
And now to write about the next rag
stunt being organised for October
the 18th. This is yet another event
traditional to Imperial College, and
for those monopoly fiends' out
there, this is for you! Have you ever
played monopoly? Really played it I
mean. Using London as the
monopoly board, travelling
between the destinations not by
rolling dice but by London
Transport? That's what Imperial
College students will be doing in
teams of 2 to 4, dressed up in
original dress and carrying a mascot
each, on Saturday October 18th.
The idea will be to set off round
London to destinations on the
Monopoly board armed with rag
cans, travelcard, set of clues and an
A to Z. At each destination, a clue
will need to be solved, and there will
be a live 'community chest', though
we cannot guarantee that we can
get you out of 'jail' if you land in
there. The winning group will
receive a camera as prize, points
being awarded for money collected,
number of clues solved, original
transport used and any unusual
objects you might 'acquire' along
the way. For those who participate,
there will be a pop concert in the
Hammersmith Town Hall held free
afterwards with a bar 'til 12.00
midnight, doors opening at 6.30pm,
bands on at 8.30pm, with disco.
Loads of other students from other
universities will be attending the
concert in the evening; people from
Loughborough rag, South Bank
rag, Bristol and Birmingham rags,
so I expect a good turnout from our
own Imperial College rag. The
bands playing will be our very own
bred Blue, Blue Ice who played at
the Funeral Party, and also Tri -60
who are semi-professional and a
very versatile band. Tickets for
non-participants of Monopoly
are available to IC students with
Union cards at 50p each from
the Union office, in advance
only, so come and buy your
tickets early.
This will be the last major rag
stunt before rag week in November,
so support your rag and have loads
of fun too. Specific details of
Monopoly will be appearing soon,
so keep your eyes open and enrol
when the posters go up!
A final re-mention of thanks to
the participants of Tiddleywinks-
lets hope Saturday 18th will be yet
another Rag Success!
