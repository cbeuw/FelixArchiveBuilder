News FELIX, Friday October 17th 1986 20
Graded
Grades
The University of London has
decided to take the controversial
step of revealing final exam marks
to students from 1st October 1987.
Currently, the marks are
confidential because the element of
discretion exercised by examiners in
assessing degrees may lead to
misunderstandings. Under the Data
Protection Act of 1984 the
University will be obliged to give
this information to individuals
within 40 days of being asked,
provided it is stored on a computer.
Other universities are considering
using loopholes to keep this
information under wraps. They can
do this either by keeping manual
files or by destroying all computer
records of the marks within 40 days.
Fire Damage
Serious damage was caused by a fire
in the Department of Social and
Economic studies in Princes
Gardens on Wednesday. The fire
was discovered by a cleaner at
6.35am on the second floor of the
building. An estimated £4000 worth
of damage was caused by smoke and
flooding when afirehose was burnt
through. A spokesman for the
Humanities Department said that
the fire had probably been started
by a cigarette carelessly discarded by
a student.
Southside
Intruder
A mysterious intruder has been
discovered sleeping in the corridor
of IC Radio in Southside, last week.
The man, who is in his twenties and
dark skinned with a student-like
appearance, has been loitering in the
area for about three months, usually
outside Southside shop. Following
complaints from the assistants that
the man had been 'ogling' at them
persistently, he was asked to move
on by Pat, The Southside security
guard. He has not been seen for the
past few days, but it is uncertain
whether or not his disappearance is
permanent.
Sports Hall
Lobby
The Athletic Clubs Council has
decided to lobby the college for a
new sports hall to replace the volley
ball court in the old Chemistry
building, which is due for
demolition soon. The Volley ball
court is the only sports hall on the
South Kensington site. The ACC
has recommended several sites for
the new hall, including the tennis
courts behind the Southside
buildings, in the Chemistry building
or over the swimming pool. They
suggest that funds for the project
should come from the sales ofgravel
mined from the Harlington Sports
grounds.
Princess Anne At IC
On Monday Princess Anne visited
the college under very tight security
for the official opening of the
Science and Technology exhibition.
She was welcomed by Lord Flowers
(Vice Chancellor of London
University), the Rector Professor
Ash and College Secretary John
Smith. A group of 40 students
congregated to see her, but were not
allowed into the JCR whilst she was
touring the exhibition.
Fallen
Arches
The decorative canopy at the front
of the Civil Engineering building
has been dismantled for safety
reasons. A spokesman for the
department explained that there had
been problems with mosaic tiles
becoming dislodged.
Exec Protest At Charges
A petition of 25,000 signatures was
handed over to Professor Sir
Richard Harrison, Chairman of The
Board of Trustees of the British
Museum, at a demonstration
against admission charges on
Thursday morning. Delegates from
the Museum Civil
the Association
Teachers (AU
Association of
Managerial Staff
present, whilst IC
was represented
Service Unions,
of University
T) and the
Technical and
(ASTMS) were
Students Union
by President
Christine Taig, Hon Sec Dave
Colley, Bill Goodwin and Mark
Cottle.
The Natural History and
Geological museums are to
introduce compulsory charges from
April 1st. The Unions believe that
this move will be self defeating
because the number of visitors will
be substantially reduced. IC
Students union are concerned that
students will be discouraged from
using the museums to supplement
their studies.
"It is ironic that the museum is
stating the need for expansion as a
reason for implementing the charges
when they admit that the number of
visitors will drop by 40%", said IC
PCS Chairman William Lindsey.
The Shadow spokesman for the
ARCS, Mr Norman Buchan, told
FELIX that the Goverment should
take the national heritage more
seriously, and said that he would be
raising questions on the subject in
Westminster.
Chemistry
Scholarships
The Chemistry Department will be
introducing a scholarship scheme
for undergraduates taking degrees
in Chemistry, or Chemistry and
Biochemistry, next year. Four
scholarships, each worth £800 a
year, are to be provided by Galaxo
Group Research, Johhan Matthey
Technology Centre, Minnesota 3M
Research, and PPF International.
Students will be selected for the
award on the basis of their UCCA
applications, academic reports, and
their admission interview. Those
short-listed will be asked to write a
statement explaining their interest in
one of the sponsoring companies,
but there will be no obligation to
work for the company at the end of
their degrees.
Very Old
Dragonfly
The most complete specimen of a
Hawker dragonfly found to date has
just been acquired by the Natural
History Museum. The 125 million
year old insect had a wingspan of
85mm and is described by its
discoverer Ed Jarzembouski as
being the best preserved specimen of
an early Hawker dragonfly found so
far, Mr Jarzembouski, of the
Entomology Department at the
museum found the dragonfly in a
Weald claypit in Surrey. It is now on
display in the Central Hall.
