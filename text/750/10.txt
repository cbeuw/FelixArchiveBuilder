A View From
The Top
by Robin Kerrod (FELIX Editor 1958/59)
'It's Davy Jones on the line. Sounds
like a sailor to me. Didn't think you
knew any sailors.' The wife's voice
drivels in from the hall. 'Says he's
something to do with Felix. Didn't
think you knew a Felix either. But
you do have funny friends.'
Well of course it was our Davy
Jones. Please write something.
Special issue. Short deadline.
Unctuous flattery. You're one ofthe
the oldest. Didn't mean that. Not
too long, not too short. You know
the sort of thing. Indeed I do.
Strangely Dave phoned almost
exactly 30 years to the day that I
started my first term at IC.When
City and Guilds still had its Gothic
portals; when the Colcutt Tower
•still had a building; when the
summers were always fine; when
grants were 70 quid a term. And of
course when FELIX was veryyoung
indeed. When enthusiasm
substituted for expertise. When it
was all cow gum, Indian ink and
stencils and all-night panics twice a
month to get the camera-ready
boards down to a little Polish litho
printer down Earls Court way. And
when we charged 3d (no, not three-
I was editing a paint journal. Two
•years later found me technical editor
of a children's encylopedia ('about
your level' everyone said, and they
wereright).And by the decade's end
I was writing science books for
children full-time.
This was, you will recall, the
Apollo Moon landing era. With
•ghostly figures kangaroo-hopping
around • the lunar surface; hot-
rodding it in the 16km/h Moon
buggy; dropping feathers and a
hammer to prove Galileo was right;
hitting a golf ball for hundreds of
metres. That is when space began to
take me over. Things astronomical
and astronautical began to
permeate my depths like a
benevolent alien influence one reads
about in sci-fi.
Come the. '80s and I am
thoroughly space-washed. And it
forces me (what a chore) to
disappear at regular intervals to
particularly fascinating parts of the
globe in search of 'stories' and
'inspiration' and to witness
significant astronautical and
astronomical events. Two such
events stand out. In spring 1981
tragically demonstrated in January
this year when Challenger exploded
in a spectacular fireball just after
lift-off, killing the seven astronaut
crew and grounding the shuttle fleet.
It was a salutary reminder, as one
commentator put it, 'of the
enduring hostility of space and the
fragility of Man'. Until we come up
with a different way of beating
gravity, except by high-explosive
fire, spaceflightwill continue to be
an excessively dangerous
occupation.
A more recent highlight was
chasing Halley's comet across the
Australian outback. The best views
of Halley were to be got in the
southern hemisphere, so there was
little choice but to go down-under
for the once in a lifetime experience.
Spending nights under the southern
stars was spectacular. The southern
skies are so much more brilliant
than our own, and of course in the
outback there is no such thing as the
light pollution that besets
astronomy in the civilised parts of
the world.
The Milky Way seems bright
enough to cast a shadow. Halley
stood out easily to the naked eye as a
luminous wedge and, comparatively
speaking, raced across the sky.
Strangely enough it was the wildlife
that occasionally upset viewing. Just
when you'd set up your telescope
and went to tell your friends, the
dingoes came along and kicked-and
on one occasion peed upon- my
tripod. And there was one
colleague, exhausted by a late
viewing session, who fell asleep
under the stars and woke up at dawn
with a female kangaroo snuggled
beside him. Well, he was a nice
looking fella!

dimensional but three old pence) for
each copy. Yes, we had to pay our
way. No sabbaticals and union
subsidies in those days!
For me FELIX found the parts
other things couldn't reach. It
triggered off artistic bents that
chemical engineering could not stifle
(that is , if you stifle a bent). So by
1960, following a stint at ICI Paints,
came the launch of the first space
shuttle from Kennedy Space Center,
which proved an awe-inspiring
experience as two test pilot
astronauts rode a totally unproven
vehicle into the heavens with no
hope of escape if anything went
wrong. What could have gone
wrong, all through the subsequent
23 missions, was so publicly and
again shall I extract the urine from
those Aussies who wear hats with
dangling corks. In the outback the
only water lies underground and all
the lakes are saltflats.Flies descend
murderously on the unprotected
flesh of those foolhardy enough to
venture outside in temperatures up
experience was, well, original. We
went down opal mines in a town
called Coober Pedy, which makes
the stage sets from old Westerns
seem positively metropolitan. We
climbed (obligatory) Ayers Rock,
which the Aboriginals call Uluru.
We sauntered in a town called Alice.
And, like everyone else, barbecued
fillet steak. But oh the flies! Never
to 110°F. Oh, for a titfer with
dangling corks. But don't forget to
leave a gap in front. I spoilt reels of
film because I didn't.
And then it was off to Bali. Bali, I
hear you say, what astronomical
delights await one there? In my case
it was Patrick Moore, a delight
astronomical if ever there was one.
And there was an eclipse of the
moon due. Could anything match
watching a total lunar eclipse, with
Halley's comet close by, and sipping
Singapore slings with Patrick
Moore on a balmy Balinese night?
Of course not. We shall not see the
like of that again.
Where to next? Well, there just
happens to be a total eclipse of the
sun in spring '88, with a path of
totality sweeping through Sumatra
and the Philippines. Yomping
halfway round the globe to see day
turn into night forjust three minutes
forty-five seconds cannot I suppose
logically be justified. But it beats
eating sausage sandwiches while
designing chemical plants in
Billingham.
Felix, dear Felix. I owe it all to
you. Seven hundred andfiftytimes
have you escaped from the presses.
May you continue to do so until
Halley comes round again, and
again, and again.
Robin Kerrod, known universally
at IC as 'Killer', edited Felix in
1958/9. He is a prolific author (he's
now on his 95th title) of science,
astronomy and space books for
young people and the general
public. He also runs a small
publishing company from his home
near Salisbury.
