James Freedman joins the Fellwanders Spring Tour at the last
minute and survives the icy Cairngorm plateau with style
A
s I sat in my first class
seat on the train from
London to Aberdeen,
enjoying the wireless in-
ternet and table service,
I spared a thought for the Fellwander-
ers who were enduring a twelve hour
minibus journey up the M1. Not too
much of a thought, however, because it
was interrupted by a stewardess bring-
ing me my lunch. The journey almost
seemed too luxurious a preface to a
week’s walking in the mountains; I felt
much more at home when changing
onto my bus in Aberdeen, and I was
greeted by a fish and chip shop con-
noisseur of a bus driver with the words:
“Braemar? What the **** do you want
to go there for?” Welcome to Scotland.
I was made to feel much more wel-
come when I rounded the corner into
Braemar Lodge to discover the group
still unloading the minibus. There
were a few surprised faces at my unan-
nounced arrival, but after locating the
only free bunk, I soon settled into an
evening of wishing I’d stopped at a su-
permarket to buy some beer.
Bright and early on Sunday morn-
ing, it was time to get stuck into some
Munros. First up were the twin peaks
of North Top and South Top, al-
though not before a long traipse along
a snowed over Landie track – some-
thing that would later develop into a
theme of the week. Our first ascent
began, and after a brief delay for Dave
to change up his shorts for his trousers,
and another brief delay for Dave to add
thermals under his trousers, we broke
through the cloud and onto a beauti-
ful plateau. North Top proved a chal-
lenging find on the lunar landscape,
but Alex’s stellar navigation guided us
to our first Munro of the week, and all
without anybody falling off a cliff or
being caught in an avalanche. A quick
trek back across the Moon and South
Top was also ours.
Our descent was sped up consider-
ably, at least for some, by the frequent
deployment of essential safety equip-
ment. Unfortunately, all this time was
then lost to The First Great Snow-
fight. Small skirmishes had been tak-
ing place all the way down the hill, and
things gradually escalated until snow-
balls the size of beach balls were being
exchanged, despite constant threats
from the resident schoolma’am that
“we would be in so much trouble”. Not
long later, we were trudging back to the
minibus through the snow.
Back in the hut, Jim and Peter treat-
ed us to a delicious Sunday roast, full
trimmings included, and there was
much rejoicing. Despite our efforts,
we didn’t quite manage to finish every-
thing; after all, “there’s no need to ram
meat down your throat just for the sake
of it”, right?
Early nights followed for most of the
group, except for the dedicated team of
dessert designers who worked into the
early hours creating The Beast.
Forged from every imaginable in-
gredient, The Beast was a four-layered
monstrosity of heart disease waiting to
happen. Weighing in at approximately
twenty kilos, it was unlike anything
we’d ever seen in a kitchen, and it
hadn’t even left the pot yet. That would
have to wait for a day of settling.
Sunrise on Monday greeted us with
traditional Scottish weather, or at least
it would have done, had the traditional
Scottish weather not obscured it. Carn
a Tuirc was our goal, and undeterred
by the wind, the rain, and the complete
absence of any shelters marked on the
map, we headed up.
The view from the summit was non-
existent, so we stayed only to argue
briefly about our next destination, and
which way it was, before setting off for
Cairn of Claise. Once again, we man-
aged a whole day without anybody fall-
ing off the many available cliffs. Morale
dropped considerably on the descent,
until finally we dropped out of the
cloud and the minibus came into view,
although still several hundred metres
below us. Thankfully, our trusty sur-
vival bags were once again at hand to
speed our descent. Stopping only to
discuss the possibilities of multiple
roadkill rabbits as dinner, we headed
back to to town to see what Braemar
had to offer.
Aside from whisky, walking equip-
ment and woollen clothing, Braemar
does not offer much, so our time would
mostly be split between the single pub
and a delicious-looking takeaway, The
Hungry Highlander, that served the
best of world cuisine: Fish and chips,
pizzas and kebabs.
After a quick trip to the pub, we re-
turned to the bunkhouse to discover
that the Beast was about to be unveiled
in all its glory. A ten minute struggle
ensued, after which we finally managed
to release it from the pot, and it sat in
the middle of the dining table challeng-
ing us to finish it – or even start it!
The top layer was a milk chocolate
and marshmallow affair, followed by a
layer of white chocolate and brownie
clusters. Below that, the cereals kicked
in, with one layer of rice krispies and
toffee and another of cornflakes. The
whole thing was almost six inches
high, and nearly two feet in diameter.
Eating it all this week would be quite
a challenge...
… a challenge we got stuck straight
into as soon as we’d finished our chili
pasta. Perhaps ambitiously, we set our-
selves the target of eating a quarter
every night, and dished portions out
amongst the group accordingly. Some
complained they were being served
too little, some too much, but nearly
all of us were soon stifled by the sheer
sweetness of the dessert. Through-
out a whole evening of the traditional
game Werewolf, and some of its less-
er-known variants, we struggled to
finish the culinary task we’d assigned
ourselves.
No walking was planned for Tues-
day, so we seized the opportunity for
a lie in with both pillows and stayed
in bed until the decadent time of eight
o’clock, when I walked into town to
buy pancakes, satisfying myself that
I had made my culinary contribution
for the week, and leaving the prepara-
tion in the much more capable hands
of Jen, who did not disappoint. Well
stuffed, we headed off to Balmoral
to see the Queen. Unfortunately, the
Queen wasn’t in (kind of her to tell us),
so we just had a poke around her house
instead, and then strolled around her
oversize garden.
Secretly, I’m sure everybody was
counting down the minutes until our
distillery tour began. Jim, James, Peter
and I even found a mini hill to climb,
although despite our best efforts, we
failed to get lost.
Royal Lochnagar did not disappoint!
Our tour guide survived most of Joe’s
technical questions, and provided us
with plenty to taste at the end. She
seemed very keen for us to know that
Royal Lochnagar are now owned and
operated by Diageo, so it would be
criminal of me not to further her cause
by leaving out that essential factoid.
This being my first time, I discovered
how water and barley become hango-
vers, and I gather that even the sea-
soned whiskey tourists learnt a thing
or two.
Once again, we
managed a whole
day without any-
body falling off
the many available
cliffs.
