Imperial College London has man-
aged to hold on to its prestigious
national standing this week accord-
ing to a newly published university
league table. The Complete Univer-
sity Guide 2011 published in the THE
Independent ranks the University 3rd
nationally behind usual one-two duo
Oxford and Cambridge respectively.
The highest placed London-based
university behind Imperial is the
London School of Economics in 5th
place. University College London,
previously placed 4th in the world
according to the Times Higher Ed-
ucation-QS World University Rank-
ings 2009 (ahead of Imperial in 5th),
is now ranked 9th nationally.
Alongside an overall ranking of
Universities, the Complete Uni-
versity Guide also provides subject
specific rankings, throughout which
Imperial also placed strongly. The
University scored highly across the
sciences, placing 1st nationally for
Civil Engineering and 2nd for Ma-
terials, Mechanical Engineering and
Chemical Engineering.
The student satisfaction ratings
listed by the Guide also exhibit some
surprising developments. Imperial’s
student satisfaction, notorious in
the past for being comparatively low
amongst the top Universities of the
country and especially in London, is,
according to the Guide, higher than
that of LSE and not far behind UCL
and King’s College London.
This University league table will, if
anything, be likely to bolster Impe-
rial’s already well regarded position
amongst both the public and poten-
tial employers. While the University
league table will give those hiring
graduates an overview of Imperial’s
credibility, the specific subject tables
are likely to be even more influen-
tial for future employers in specialist
fields such as engineering.
However, some continue to criti-
cise the use of league tables, citing
bias towards better funded and older
institutions as a significant flaw in
the system. Indeed, in Imperial’s case,
science and engineering degrees re-
quire greater research income and
ultimately provide more employable
graduates than a University running
both science and arts courses.
The Russell Group, of which Impe-
rial is a member, receives two thirds
of research grant and contract fund-
ing in the UK, thereby elevating the
twenty Universities who are part of
the group above the others with its
greater wealth.
On the other hand, this latest sur-
vey appears to suggest that this bias
is being overturned, with newer in-
stitutions such as the University of
Hertfordshire (rising four places this
year to 41st) fighting back against
older and more traditional counter-
parts. In addition to the rise in stu-
dent satisfaction, this goes some way
towards justifying Imperial’s contin-
ued steady and impressive position
across the league tables year after
year.

The sun’s out, the casts are off.
T
he summer officially arrived in London this week. Despite
being exam season, plenty of students found time to soak
up the sun on Queen’s Lawn. Long may it continue as
College have confirmed that there will be no erection of marquees
on Queen’s Lawn this summer, although a never-seen-before stage
will be constructed in time for the Summer Ball.
felix found this student during a sunny lunchtime. He’d taken the
rare chance to remove his ankle-cast and give his ailing leg some
fresh air and a nice tan. Get well soon, mate.
