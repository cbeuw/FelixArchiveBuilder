W
hile the press-day
invites from M&S
or Aspreys headed
straight for the
recycling bin, the
invitation to Graduate Fashion Week
remains securely fastened to the dia-
ries of buyers and editors. The annual
event which begins on the 6th June this
year will take place at Earls Court 2.
Static exhitbitions as well as 22 fashion
shows showcases the works of BA stu-
dents from across the country.
Dresses scuplted to architectural
precision as well as innovative and
futuristic designs attract fashionis-
tas of all calibres to attend the event.
Last year, the fashion mongul of the
blogosphere – Susie Lau of Stylebub-
ble, was given a stall at the exhibition
to blog live from the event. Street style
hunters, such as the photographers
from Facehunter, ElleUK and Style
Scout, need rolls and rolls of films (or
memory sticks) to capture the diversity
and originality of the eclectic fashion
which the UK is renouned for.
Knowing the importance to keep
the blood flowing in fashion design
in the UK, many big names from the
industry, such as Gareth Pugh, Giles
Deacon, Zandra Rhodes, Victoria
Beckham, Erin O’Connor and Claudia
Schiffer proudly lent their time to the
shows.
Creme de la creme of the fresh
graduates from 50 universities across
the UK will compete for a place in the
Gala Show, where all the guests on ei-
ther side of the runway hold private
invitations. The show culminates in an
award ceremony, where a winner will
be selected by a panel of judges.
This year, the fate of the students
will be decided by Alberta Ferretti of
her eponymous label, Kim Jones of
Dunhill, Lorraine Candy of Elle, Dylan
Jones of GQ and Naomi Dominque of
River Island.
The most outstanding collection
will be awarded the River Island Gold
Award, which a cash prize of £20,000
as well as an extra £2000 as an reim-
bursement for their education will be
handed out.
The first GFW happened in 1991,
when Smirnoff sponsored a student
fashion show at the Business Design
Centre in Islington. Sponsors come
and go, and sadly GFW hit the trough
when it found no willing companies to
fund the event in 1993.
Luckily, the Health Education Au-
thority, BHS, Esprit and Topshop rec-
ognised the importance of promoting
and supporting the talent of tomorrow,
and they have since linked their names
with the event. The bucket was finally
passed to River Island, who has been
funding GFW happily since 2004.
Apart from signing the cheque for
the Gold Award, River Island also re-
cruits ex-GFW participants for design
roles. This year’s collection of print-
ed mini shorts, PVC body sculpting
dresses, jewellery and footwear mod-
elled by the singer-songwriter Kelis.
Menswear will be fronted by Diversity
dancer Ashley Banjo. The pieces will
hit the stores from the 24th May.
Members of the public can buy tick-
ets for the exhibition and the shows on
the GFW website. A limited number
of tickets at £50 will get you into the
invitation only Gala Show at 8pm. This
package also includes entry for the
award ceremony as well as the after
show party.

The hidden subtleties of eye make-up
A
fter introducing the fun-
damentals of make up
over the last few weeks,
we can move on to some
more exciting aspects of
make-up, the ones that can really make
you stand out from the crowd.
It’s often said that the eyes are the
windows of the soul. Eyeliner and mas-
cara can prove to be the difference be-
tween being a Plain Jane to being a sexy
fashionista, giving shape and defini-
tion to highlight your eyes. They really
are the fundamentals of eye make-up,
but there is still a lot of scope to play
around with colours, application tech-
niques and different types of make-up
Available in over ten different colours,
this liquid liner will allow you to
experiment with new exciting looks.
Long-lasting and water resistant, this
gel form of eyeliner offers the precision
of a liquid liner but is easier to apply
than most liquids.
This cake eye-liner is perfect. It lasts
forever and with a choice of black or
brown, it’s compact and suitable for day
and evening-wear. Don’t forget, you
need to find a good brush to accompany
this cake eyeliner, which Benefit will
also provide for a meagre £12.50. Their
‘Get Bent’ liner brush makes for easy
application, especially when doing the
top eyelids.

When it comes to eyeliner, there are
a few different types to choose from;
not only liquid or pencil, we also have
cakes and gels and other, more exotic
types, such as felt-tips. Personally, I
use a combination of a kohl pencil and
a cake eyeliner. An important point to
note when using cake eyeliners is that
a quality brush to apply it with is essen-
tial. Because the kohl pencil is easier to
apply, I use this on the bottom eyelid,
and then apply the cake eyeliner to the
top. I find it best to have a variation
between black and brown eyeliners so
that you can use brown during the day
and black for a night out.
You don’t have to limit yourself to
black and brown. For a night out, ex-
periment with other colours. I find that
