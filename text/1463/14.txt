The age of the beloved
‘Marina’ from Marina and the
Diamonds.
O
h, mad, kooky Marina.
Undoubtedly, the emo-
tions generated within
my eccentric mind
whilst listening to her
music are a paradoxical blur of child-
hood, macaroni-glitter-and-glue joy
and grown-up, sneaky-cigarettes-on-
the-side delectation.
Performing in the Bloomsbury
Ballroom, the ridiculously posh-
sounding venue in central London,
Marina And The Diamonds – her
“diamonds” being her fans, accord-
ing to the lady herself – blasted
out the majority of her album and a
few covers. I can report, with an ir-
repressible grin, that it was both a
visual and sonic treat for the senses:
the musical equivalent of tiramisu,
surely the ultimate in desserts.
‘I probably have a bit of a different
sound because I don’t really know
what I’m doing,’ she once said. Well,
who does? The best things in life of-
ten emerge from those who are just
winging it. The difference between
her and most indie-pop-new-wave-
upside-down-topsy-turvey acts out
there these days is that she is both
confident and impatient, both pow-
erful-yet-rare virtues in the hedonis-
tic 21st Century.
Case in point: the first album, for
many bands, has a few songs on
it that are specifically designed to
launch themselves into the public
consciousness, whether through ac-
cessible, catchy lyrics, or something
that is so infuriatingly annoying, in-
tellectually insulting, yet impossibly
persistent. Marina’s debut album
contains lyrics involving metaphori-
cal vomiting, musings over tooth-
paste, and lots of monkey noises. Oh,
and at one point, she is, we assume,
pursued by come rather naughty cut-
lery. You must be both impatient and
confident to fire yourself into the
public soundscape with material like
that; better yet, you must be incred-
ibly talented to make it sound so ut-
terly brilliant.
Lyrically, she weaves contempo-
rary poetry, pointing out those who
disappoint and those who could be
so much more: “You’ve been hanging
with the unloved kids/who you never
really liked and you never trusted/
but you are so magnetic/you pick up
all the pins.” Her songs are colour-
ful, mystical, and pleasingly ironic
takes on people and their highlights,
misgivings, and misjudgements, in-
cluding her own; she picks apart
mentalities and infuses them with
her own individualistic flair. Each
track performed not only has its own
personality, but its own unique vocal
identity. The rapid pitch-changes on
“Hollywood”; the ethereal highs of “I
Am Not A Robot”; the melancholy
“Obsessions”; the near-insane Jungle
Book-infused “Mowgli’s Road”: all

Wow! An eclectic mix of Coldplay, The Killers and Radiohead, I have news for
you people... They all sound the same. I have better bands to talk about, Pino Pal-
ladino, Steve Jordan and John Mayer here I come. - Luke
completely different, and all a won-
der to listen to.
Live, she is as kooky as she ap-
pears in her music videos. Leaping
and pouncing may be a high-enough
level of eccentricity for most bands,
but that is merely a base-line for this
one. How about arms and legs made
of folded paper flinging in all direc-
tions in a very eerie yet gorgeously-
choreographed dance number? Pine-
apple sunglasses, photoluminescent
lipstick, and a piano-driven cover of
3OH!3’s incomprehensibly-misogy-
nistic “Starkstrukk” - flipping it on
its head - are some of the things Ma-
rina brings to the chaotic table.
If you can find another new, bright
spark in the British music industry
with this much creativity, I will per-
sonally eat one of my many trilby
hats. She has a gorgeous voice, one
that sparkles like, well, a thousand
diamonds, and the lyrical ingenuity to
match. You can sense that she is still
very much getting to grips with the
entire rollercoaster ride that inevita-
bly comes with venturing into the mu-
sic industry – she is constantly smil-
ing in that ever-so-slightly-cheeky
way, poking fun at herself, and the
rather uniquely-static businessman
leaning against the wall of the venue
right at the back. She knows she has
taken quite a giant leap forwards with
songs that, on paper, really ought to
appeal to just the more quirky mem-
bers of the population. I guess there
are a few more mad-hatters out there
than we all initially thought: this, of
course, is music to my ears.
Of course, her music may not ap-
peal to all. I am not professing to be
outrageously cool and unorthodox for
adoring a relatively-unknown artist,
nor will I suddenly start to dislike her
music when her popularity inexorably
crashes through the proverbial roof.
What I am saying is that this rising
star is outrageously cool and fantas-
tically, wonderfully unorthodox. Not
all who wander are lost; however,
those who do get lost along the way
tend to find the most exciting things
to show to the folks back home.
