I
’d like to draw your attention
to a piece of news which hasn’t
received nearly as much cov-
erage as it deserves; the new
Louis Vuitton store opening
in Bond Street (chill, I won’t start
talking about shoes). It was prob-
ably dwarfed by iPad news. For the
life of me I can’t understand why so
many people want such a gadget. It’s
the sheer scale of interest that sur-
prises me most! I do understand
why certain individuals need to get
gadgeted-up but these kind of sales
are comparable to a gadget that’s ac-
tually useful.
Anyway, let’s not digress, next
thing you know we’re talking about
manbags.
Did I say I wasn’t going to start
talking about shoes? I lied. I’ll get
straight to the good stuff. High
heels. Of course, they are a solution
for the vertically challenged female
but I propose that they are more than
that. Yes, they make legs look good
but cheerleaders’ legs look good and
they wear trainers. And yes, heels
look elegant (unless they’re wedges).
But their excellence is derived from
the acoustics. That’s right, the clip-
clop noise when walking.
Now, even if you’re a man and you
probably are (a man so bored he fan-
cied reading about shoes), you will
know about the noise of footsteps.
For example, rubber soles tend to
be near silent (I like to sport these
around college to keep a low-pro-
file). With high heels however you
get two sounds per footfall (when
I walk I put heel down followed by
toe). However I do not claim that
this is the correct way to walk in
heels as my mother never taught me
how. I presume that’s what mothers
are for? But all credit to her she did
say I looked like a camel, and as a
result I try to be as uncamel-like as
possible and I’ve had no complaints
thus far.
So why do I like the sound of high
heels? It is the sound of class, noth-
ing more, nothing less. Though un-
fortunately, heels are not necessarily
the vision of class; unless you walk
properly you look like a confused
slapper. What’s sad is that I’m stuck
in a vicious cycle. I don’t walk well
in heels. I don’t wear heels. I don’t
get better at walking in heels. I don’t
walk well in heels. It’s a tough life, I
can tell you.
To clarify, I don’t really care about
Louis Vuitton as such, he’s merely
French designer. If I’m going to pub-
licise a shoe designer it’s going to be
a female and a Brit, say L.K. Ben-
nett. I adore L.K. Bennett. There’s
a branch in King’s Road where I try
on the shoes and come up with in-
creasingly elaborate reasons for the
assistants as to why I am unable to
complete the purchase. I may have
to start using other branches.
I couldn’t talk about shoes without
mentioning FMBs. For the ignorant
this is a most appropriate time to
educate you. I only recently discov-
ered this acronym and I am feeling it
through and through, having seen a
good friend of mine purchase some
boots which truly matched the FM
sentiment. Fun for all the family.
Finally I’ll touch upon bags. Bags
are always a very controversial topic
so I’ll try not to arouse too much
animosity.
I’m not kidding here, bags are no
joke when you have a lot of thingie-
mebobs and nowhere to put them.
Men’s clothes are pockets galore
and unlike women’s clothing there
are few fake pockets or pockets that
are too small or tight so that if you
squish your phone in, you look de-
cidedly asymmetrical. Let’s be prac-
tical. Absolute essentials for a girl
include purse (usually drastically out
of proportion to contents which puz-
zles me), phone (preferably in a pink
case but don’t get me wrong, any col-
our glitter is also permissible), tis-
sues (apparently it’s not so uncom-
mon for men to be with tissue these
days, they say hayfever, I say no need
to make excuses I can’t stand seeing
men cry), a book (if you’re trying to
impress someone, be sure it falls to
the floor at some point), and college
ID card (unless you want to be chat-
ted up whilst attempting to tailgate).
This has happened to me both whilst
opening the door and whilst having
the door opened for me. Just so you
know, it didn’t turn out to be a story
for the kids. Point is, check out LK
Bennett, where both bags and shoes
are sold. Also dresses. But dresses
are another story entirely…
Phil Sandwell has a new way to assess knowledge
“[high-heels]...
unless ou walk
properly, you look
like a confused
slapper”
T
he third term is synony-
mous with examination.
Recently I decided to put
a little thought into the
exams; not just in the usu-
al brain-aching way, but about how I
would improve them.
Firstly, I decided that their timing
is all wrong. It has been impossible to
escape the mini-heat wave that has re-
cently graced the country with its rare
presence. Even the students who have
become permanent fixtures in the Li-
brary have been seen gazing lustfully
at the Queen’s Lawn, yearning for an
opportunity to enjoy the fickle British
weather while it lasts. So why, I ask,
are exams held in the summer? Far
better, say, to hold the exams in No-
vember or December, when students
will be far more motivated to revise
and enticed into College by the warm
bosom of free central heating. All that
would be required would be a small
rescheduling of the term timetable,
moving lectures into August and
putting the summer holiday in Janu-
ary. On second thoughts, the prospect
of a three-month vacation spent at
home, in the West Country, in winter
is a very unappealing one, as anyone
who has ever seen Swindon in the rain
can attest. A deserved break when the
sun still shines is retrospectively far
more attractive.
The point of exams is to assess and
apply the knowledge we have suppos-
edly gained in the previous year. Un-
fortunately, the traditional way to do
this is to sit everyone down and make
them take a test. Under what scenario
outside of an exam room will you ever
be required to solve problems under
a time limit, and without the use of
Wikipedia? I didn’t come to university
to just know things, I want to under-
stand them, and so I think a better test
of understanding is required. Some-
one wise once said that if you can’t
explain something to an intelligent
ten-year-old then you don’t truly un-
derstand it yourself: perhaps College
should therefore enlist an army of
primary school children to judge the
intellectual capabilities of students.
This might collapse, however, when
you have to spend several hours ex-
plaining to your examiner-child what
differentiation is, let alone what use
it is to you. Explaining your under-
standing to someone more qualified
than you would save a lot of time, but
the prospect of standing before one of
my lecturers and displaying precisely
how much I didn’t learn from him is
one I would rather not face. Perhaps
three hours in the Great Hall isn’t so
bad in comparison to a personal aca-
demic firing squad.
Worst of all, though, is that exams
can be really boring. While gawping at
one piece of paper in order to organ-
ise your thoughts onto a different one
may be the best method examination,
I would like to see tests be modified
into a more accurate reflection of stu-
dent life. The assessment would begin
with a communal nap in the lecture
theatre, followed by a buzzer sound-
ing the start of the race to the Union.
After a pint has been consumed you
can leave for the Library, where you
will then have to forcibly remove a
World of Warcraft enthusiast from
his (or her... his) terminal in order to
post an inane Face-status. You can
leave to start your exam once some-
one has liked it. While I think this is
fair test of how good a student you
are, degrees are apparently awarded
for academic ability; this makes nap-
ping, drinking and Facebook entirely
extra-curricular, regardless of how
much time I’ve spent revising them. If
we wanted degrees in pissing around
we would all be studying English; it
looks like the dullness is here to stay,
and rightly so.
Like death and the taxman, exams
are a necessary evil. Despite their
shortcomings, several hours of pro-
crastination have not yet led me to
a way in which they could be notice-
able improved, and nor will several
inevitable hours more. I think exams
are a lot like injections: unpleasant,
sadistic and terrifying, but they’re
over quickly probably good for me in
the long term. And hopefully I’ll only
have to have each one once.
