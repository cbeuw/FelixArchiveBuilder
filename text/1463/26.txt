SeanFarres Puzzle Captain
GLT has took the points again for
yet another puzzle! Is no one going
to stop this winning-streak?! Sheryl
is quietly creasing the gap, coming in
2nd on this puzzle and many others.
As always we can put a guest puzzle
in, so if you fancy your name in print
drop us an email at
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk
Z
enzizenzizenzic is a word
meaning ‘the square of a
square, squared’ i.e. an inte-
ger’s eighth power. I inform
you of this as I wanted to begin this
piece with a big ‘Z’.
Murdoch’s away so I’ve got these first
two pages entirely to myself! Which
would have been fantastic had I had
more notice; it really just means more
more work for me to do. So this week,
you may or may not have yet noticed,
but there’s a big maze on the opposite
page. This was not made by me, it was
dug up out of a much older issue and
was contributed by Natalie Wood.
Look forward to seeing more ressur-
rected puzzles in the coming issues.
Also look out for the reseperation of
Nonogram and Slitherlink, and the re-
turn of Wordoku!
A final note; I’m constantly looking
out for new puzzles to bring you so if
there’s a type of puzzle you’d like to
see, let me know!
If there’s a puzzle here you just don’t
like and think should be cut tell me
what it is and that’ll be the puzzle that
gets replaced.
Don’t want to see your favourite
puzzle cut? Send in your answers! All
popular puzzles will be spared.
Wordpath 1,463
How to play:
Make a path from the origin word to the destination
word by taking steps between words using one of the
three following methods:
Letter Substitution: Substitute just one letter.
e.g. WORDS -> WARD
Anagram: Rearrange the letters.
e.g. WARD -> DRAW
Wordslide: Replace the current word with a new 4 letter
word from any 5+ letter word that contains them both.
e.g. DRAW-> WING (via DRAWING)
No consecutive steps may be made by the same method.
e.g. WORD -> WARD (by LS) -> WARE (by LS)
would be invalid.
Points are awarded for the earliest SHORTEST valid path
between the two words. Dubious words will be checked
against the OED. Send your solutions to
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

under each number points to the square containing the number one greater

This winning solution (for both the
Nonogram and the Slitherlink) was
submitted by GLT who also was not
alone in realising I had made a slight
mistake and the Slitherlink numbers
populated the shaded cells! Sorry.
Nevertheless the were numerous
submissions this week despite exams.
Keep those submissions coming.
