The Open Source Problem
Feroz Salam looks at why the open source mantra is so confused
I
f you’re unfamiliar with the con-
cept of open source software,
you’re definitely not alone. In a
market full of expensive consum-
er electronics that are locked down
and bound to carriers and application
stores, the concept of releasing the
code to software that has taken you
hundreds of hours to create may seem
unintuitive, even silly. Yet despite the
unorthodox business model that it en-
genders, open source software is sur-
prisingly successful. A Linux server is
probably behind a majority of websites
you browse daily, whilst open-source
Android powered smartphones have
recently begun outselling the iPhone
in the US. Yet despite a few notable
exceptions, the concepts behind open
source are opaque to the average con-
sumer, which is in my opinion, to the
detriment of the entire movement.
One reason for this situation could
be the fact that the concepts and ide-
ology that define free/open source
software have been made ridiculously
complicated by those creating the soft-
ware. It’s hard to get an ideological
movement going if no-one within the
movement can agree what the ideol-
ogy truly is. An interesting example
of this situation is the case of Linus
Torvalds and Richard Stallman, two
very important people in the world of
open source. Between them, they have
helped in the creation of some of the
most widely used software tools in
the world. Yet their philosophies on
the way code should be released differ
greatly. Stallman is the leading figure
in the Free Software Movement, an or-
ganisation that works towards software
that can be freely distributed, modified
and used without restrictions. The
Free Software Movement could fairly
accurately be described as the radical
far-left of the software industry. Stall-
man, in a testament to this culture,
will only use a single Chinese netbook
that solely runs free and open source
software and nothing else. In contrast,
the general open source movement
(that the Free Software Movement at-
tempts to distance itself from) isn’t as
concerned with the licensing issues as
they are with spreading the concept of
open source, even if that means having
to work with closed-source compa-
nies in a trade-off. Those behind the
Linux kernel recently accepted a code
contribution from Microsoft, with Li-
nus Torvalds (the father of Linux) say-
ing: “I really find the whole notion of
Linux as being “against Microsoft” to
be silly and wrong-headed”. With there
being no agreement within the move-
ment, it’s hard to attract investment
from businesses, who worry that the
frequent and drastic licensing changes
that have typified the last few years of
open source software design, might
work against them in the long term.
One of the greatest things about
open source software is choice. There’s
a huge amount of software out there,
and some of it is great. Yet the com-
munity behind open source software
can sometimes be intimidating to
say the least. From Stallman with his
frankly ridiculous Free Software Song
to the endless bickering about soft-
ware choices on internet forums, get-
ting advice on software that is impar-
tial and unclouded by dogma is hard.
Advertising campaigns seem only to
attack other closed source software
without really educating people about
benefits of open source. The end effect
is a confusing jumble of contradictory
ideas all being shouted at loud volumes
- an effect that is frankly annoying and
off-putting.
Yet despite these problems, open
source software has grown remark-
ably over the last decade. Linux has
been at the forefront of this growth,
with its dominance of the server mar-
ket, running the majority of the world’s
supercomputers, and even the surpris-
ing rise of Google’s Android mobile
operating system. In some ways, the
approach taken by Linux has been the
most pragmatic, accepting help from
those who offer it regardless of differ-
ing ideologies and with a surprising
resistance to dogma. Its success shows
that open source can succeed. Yet as
long as the continual disputes over ide-
ology and licensing continue, it’s prob-
able that businesses won’t see open
source as a serious and viable option
to replace their current software pack-
ages. In the end, consumers will simply
choose big named closed-source alter-
natives that don’t come with the bag-
gage of ideologies that they feel they
have no personal investment in or sim-
ply don’t understand.
I
f you haven’t heard, Google
launched its attempt to infiltrate
the TV space with Internet con-
tent. Google TV aims to bring not
only video but the whole Internet onto
the small screen. But it’s not the first to
attempt to do so. Microsoft tried and
failed to do the same thing many years
ago with its WebTV. Google thinks
the failures of the past have been due
to poor implementation, but I beg to
differ.
OK, having certain web content on
your TV would be a boon. Web video
such as YouTube, Hulu and the pleth-
ora of other user created and network
produced online video sites often de-
serve to get off your monitor and ac-
tually onto your primary watching de-
vice, your TV. But anyone who’s ever
tried to surf the web on their TV will
know that it’s a paradigm that simply
doesn’t work.
The thing is your TV viewing ex-
perience is a long distance one. You
sit several metres from your TV and
control it with a simple remote. Read-
ing subtitles, and possibly the digital
text that replaced TeleText, is about as
much reading as you’re ever likely to
do on your TV and there’s a reason for
that. Reading text on your TV is both a
strain on your eyes and plainly annoy-
ing if the text is too small.
To do justice to web browsing on
your TV you’re going to have to sit
pretty close to that screen of yours,
even if it is a monster. And that’s the
problem; you are going to have to get
off your comfy sofa and either grab a
chair or sit on the floor in the middle
of your living room. If your TV was
the only place to consume the web,
perhaps this would be a viable option,
but it’s not. I for one am not going to
bother getting off my arse just to view a
bit of news or IMDB on my TV when I
Weekly Wrap-up: A quick guide to the best of the rest you might have missed
R
oll up, roll up, what
have we got for you
this week eh? Well in
the wake of the Goog-
le geekfest that was Google IO,
the big G’s web video format
came under a bit of fire.
WebM, heralded by Google
as the open source answer to
the video war currently rag-
ing in the HTML5 spec,
has spiked the interest of
the MPEG-LA, the folks
who licence out the
H.264 specification.
According to them,
the WebM with VP8
video codec flies
just a little too close
to the premium H.264
codec and therefore might
not be as free as everyone
thinks. Maybe Steve Jobs was
right when he said patent liti-
gation was not far away for the
open source audio and video
codecs.
The little green Android has
also been in the news this week
with Froyo causing quite a stir.
Google claims Android 2.2
has the fastest mobile
browser and it’s quite
possible with Froyo
showing a 4.5x
speed increase
in several bench-
marks over Eclair.
Then we’ve
got the news that
‘Gingerbread’ will
be the next tasty edition
of Android, packing WebM
support among other things
and will land around Q4 2010.
More mobile news this week
from Samsung with Europe’s
first Bada phone, the Wave.
OK, the phone is pretty sweet,
but Bada, well, let’s just say it’s
a bit disappointing. Slap An-
droid on it for goodness sake!
LG showed off some serious
3D screen real-estate this week
with their 84-inch 3DTV, pack-
ing a whopping 3840x2160 res-
olution. That’s UHD, or Ultra
HD; shame about the highly
‘fashionable’ glasses you need.
Sony was in on the OLED
action this week with its pro-
totype rollable OLED display.
The 4.1 inch display is 80µm
thin and can wrap around
anything thicker than 8mm in
diameter, like a pen or pen-
cil. Outputting 16M colours
with a 1000:1 contrast ratio
and 100nits brightness, the
432x240 resolution display
could be the future of wear-
able, rollable, slide out displays
just like every decent sci-fi
movie. Let’s just hope it makes
it to market in the near future.
Social networking is a luxury
that the majority of us enjoy
in one form or another, but
it’s undoubtedly a great way
to get into trouble if you’re in
the public spotlight. To save
his players from that prob-
lem, England manager Fabio
Capello has banned his squad
from partaking in Twitter and
Facebook. To be fair out of the
preliminary named squad only
Darrent Bent, the Sunderland
striker, actually used Twitter.
So if you were hoping for in-
the-dressing-room progress
reports from Rooney, Lampard
and Rio, I’m afraid you’re out
of luck.
Nokia and Yahoo announced
a partnership this week to
trade services. Nokia is going
to run Yahoo’s online mapping,
to take on market leader Goog-
le Maps, whilst Yahoo is going
to bring its webmail expertise
to Nokia phones. More com-
petition is always good, but can
Nokihoo! really compete?
Last but not least, Apple
launched the iPad in the UK
today. Available in store with
seriously short supply, good
luck actually getting one.
All Google

can just grab my iPhone, my laptop, my
netbook or perhaps my tablet and do
it. It’ll be a damn sight better browsing
experience on all those devices than it
possibly could be on my TV.
If we look at the devices that can
currently access the Internet that pack
a browser and are plugged into your
TV, we’ve got things like the PS3, the
Wii, Media Centre PCs, perhaps even
a Boxee box or Mac Mini. All of these
devices do an admirable job of render-
ing text on the big screen, but you have
to zoom in so far to actually read it that
it disrupts the browsing experience
well beyond being a decent one.
Is the answer reformatting and re-
flow of text to fit the screen? Perhaps
you could strip out the content from
the site and display it in a purpose
made ‘TV mode’. But again, isn’t it just
easier to grab that netbook that’s be-
side you?
The other problem with browsing on
your TV is that for the most part, TV
watching isn’t a solitary experience.
Are your friends, family or strangers
watching in from the street, really go-
ing to be chuffed with you taking up all
or a significant portion of the screen
to look up who directed the Exorcist?
Perhaps the only social aspect of the
current web experience is web video,
meaning the browser simply gets you
to the video content, nothing more.
Google initially wants you to use
another box under your TV that es-
sentially sits in between your content
boxes like Sky, Virgin, FreeviewHD or
FreeSatHD receivers and your TV. It’s
another box to buy that doesn’t really
do anything you can’t already do with
other devices. Perhaps once Google
manages to get Google TV into actual
TVs with partners like Sony, maybe
you’ll find it gaining traction. But that’s
still only a maybe for the big G.
