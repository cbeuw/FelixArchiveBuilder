GLT won this week. That’s pretty
much all there is to say... I don’t see
why this box has to be this big. There’s
not that much information that has to
go here. We only had two entries this
week so send more to the usual place;
sudoku.felix@imperial.ac.uk.

COFFEE BREAK
felix FRIDAY 28 MAY 2010
Hummus-scopes: Horoscopes packs a healthy lunch
Drain chickpeas, crush garlic and add two heaping spoonfuls of hate and desperation. Goes down smooth.
Cancer
This report is
driving you mad.
Spreadsheets, T-tests,
chi-squared. What
the hell is a chi and
is it a square? You
didn’t come here to do maths, you came to do...
Mathematics and Computer Science. You press
your face against the screen to become one with
Excel. It doesn’t work. Instead, the screen breaks
and you get bits of glass and WoW in your eyes.
Virgo
You had heard the
sex scene in Avatar
was a bit weird but
you though it might
involve more blue
people. With horror,
you realise you’re not watching Avatar but a
sex-tape your parents made. Still, porn is porn.
But then, with even greater horror, you realise
you’re not watching a tape – you’re in their
bedroom.
Gemini
The night before your
exam, you stay up
playing Modern War-
fare 2 to calm yourself.
It doesn’t work. In the
exam hall, you draw a
blank. The invigilator comes over to tell you time
is up. You drop into a crouch, knife him and strafe
your way out. The security lodge sends out a jug-
gernaut and you never get past the front door.
Pisces
This weather is
glorious! It’s so good
in fact that you get
your sandals out of
the wardrobe – but
you keep your socks
on, just in case. As you strut about campus with
pride, a rabid felix editor pounces on you and rips
off your feet, carrying them back as a cannibalistic
sacrifice to the pagan gods of Watford.
Leo
You wake up one
morning to find a baby
left on your doorstep.
You take it in, raise it
and teach it everything
you know. With the
exam coming up, that has shrunk to just fluid
dynamics. Worse still, you can’t find a sitter on the
day so take Baby with you to sit the exam together.
Amazingly, he passes with a first. You are a great
teacher...but not a good student. You fail.
Aries
Enjoying the sunshine,
you check your fridge
for some ice-cream.
Success, it’s there! But
when you open it up,
you realise something’s
wrong with the freezer – it’s all melted into a va-
nilla goop. Unperturbed, you dig in. Only then do
you realise that it wasn’t ice-cream but your house-
mate’s urine sample for chlamydia screening. Still,
it’d be a shame to waste it now.
Scorpio
You spent the entire
term cooped up in the
Library but now sum-
mer is here – and you’re
ready for it. Sandals,
shorts, flowery shirt;
you’re all set. You grab your shades and head to the
nearest beach. Unfortunately, you accidentally re-
vised through to January and everything’s frozen
over. Determined to make the best of a bad situa-
tion, you buy an ice-cream. It melts.
Libra
Why is the Library so
damn hot? The rank
smell of sweat and fear
hang heavy in the air.
You search for a fan
but the noobs playing
WoW have taken them all. You try to open a
window but Security have nailed them shut. As a
last resort, you pull all the books off the shelves,
start a massive fire in the silent study area and
throw yourself in. Ah, relief!
Taurus
The bathroom smells
funny. The mould in
the bath is pretty rank
by now. Armed only
with a toothbrush,
you wade in to tackle
it. Your feeble attempts only serve to enrage the
mould. It grabs you with a tendril and draws you
to its fausty breast. Since you haven’t gotten any
since 2007, you go down on it with a passion. You
get a yeast infection – what a whore!
Capricorn
You’re in the Union,
getting famously
gazeboed when
your friend hands
you another drink.
You smash it before
declaring it UCL-weak bull-piss. The bar staff
have had enough of this and finally snap. They lay
into you mercilessly with beer taps. Crumpled and
beaten, you spit out some teeth and your tongue.
Still now you won’t be able to taste the next...pint?
Aquarius
After a disastrous
food-experiment left
you with a colostomy
(When they say its
hot, you’d better
believe them!), you
decide to stick with plain foods from now on.
Nice, simple hummus. Nothing bad can happen
with hummus. Suddenly, a man jumps out of
your bowl and stabs you in the eye. Warning:
may contain ninjas.

Sagittarius
You should be focussing
on this revision lecture
but the girl in front of
you is just so beautiful.
You try to talk to her
but she shushes you.
Undeterred, you cut off a lock of her hair for some
self-abuse later. She doesn’t notice so you trim a
little more off. By the end of the session, she’s bald
and you have all her hair in your lap. Desperate to
get rid of the evidence, you eat it. And choke.
