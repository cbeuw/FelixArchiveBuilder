THE SUN EXPLAINED BY REAL SCIENCE
Before you read the following two columns, may I make a disclaimer: Don’t read the following two columns
Johnny_Majorz_aka_pussydestroyer
Yo shut da fuck up Boyeee! Don’t mess wid
Johnny Majorz, he’s a lethal weapon and keeps
ur ho’s in cages. Yo, I spit like a soldier, ur daugh-
ter’s hot, but I’ll wait till she’s older. Luv JM xxx
T
he Sun is a powerful en-
emy and should be re-
garded as such. The only
people that like the Sun
are trees, and what do we
need trees for? Yeah exactly - nothing!
The Sun just sits there and burns
(or fuses, or fizzes or whatever). You
can’t even look at it without incinerat-
ing your retinas. What is the point in
something you can’t look at? Useless
lump of gas. It’s not even one of those
cool suns that collapses to a black hole,
no; it’s one of those lame-ass white
dwarf ones. I dread the day we make
contact with alien life forms in other
galaxies and they laugh at our solar
system, “HAHAHAHA, Planet Earth,
Barack_attack_l33thaxor
Are you kiddin? He’s an insane rapper. He’s like
a 16th African American or sumthin. Helped
Jay Z with his first album.
you are so gay! Your sun is so gay and
small and all your dicks are small and
your children are well ugly HAHA-
HAHAHA”. Bloody aliens with their
bloody big dicks and sexy children.
However shit the Sun may be at be-
ing a sun, he’s still a dangerous c**t. He
burns your eyes, gives you cancer and
steals your jobs. If you think slapping
on a palm-full of sun cream is going to
stop him from molesting you with his
rays of tiny quantum penises, then you
had better think again!
Did you know that a freckle is actu-
ally a bruise from a quantum penis?
Subjection to constant bombardment
of quantum penises is now more for-
mally known as ‘tanning’.
My Summer Frolics
A summery poem by
Mustapha Hungmun
Everyone seems to love the
summer,
Girls walking about in slutty
shorts,
Guys walking about in slutty
shorts,
Children walking about in
slutty shorts,
And yet only I make the
discerning question,
What is summer?
Who is summer?
Am I summer?
Is it that summery sip of a
zesty quencher?
A jubilant promenade down
summery paths?
The morning robin that
wakes me with his summery
song?
No, seriously
what IS summer?
At first I was being all philo-
sophical and poetic, but now
I’m just freaking out, Too many
words, who am I? I don’t even
know what I am anymore,
SHIT I’m having an existen-
tial crisis here...SHIIIIT...
FUCK,,,AHHHHHH, This gun,
it’s the only way, banish these
tyrannical thoughts, I hope my
head misses the keyboard......

Einstein won the Nobel prize for his revolutionary paper on quantum penises
