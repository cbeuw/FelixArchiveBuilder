U N I O N OFFICERS!
Welfare
Officer
Rape Alarms
New batch now in. G o and see
Christine Teller for one of these
at lunchtimes in the U n i o n
Office. Two points: a) they can
be very dangerous, and b) they
are to be taken seriously. So
don't play.
Southside Security
There is little point in protecting
residents by locking the doors at
6:00 if the system is not adhered
to. It is your business to ask
someone who hangs a r o u n d
outside until you have got the
door open and nips in, just
where they are going. Please take
it seriously, or is it that you
enjoy being reminded about
locking your rooms even if you
are going to the loo?
Gaysoc
No great developments. I've had
very little feedback on this, but
I'll give it a little longer.
Fire Doors
Falmouth Keogh balcony is now
sorted out. Thanks to the guy
who told me about Beit but the
door there is apparently O K .
Office Hours
As a trial run I will try to be
available in the Union Office
from about 12:45 to 1:30 on
Monday, Tuesday and Thursday
for the next couple of weeks.
Anyone who wants to chat to me
about anything is welcome to
drop in then. Advance notice
would be appreciated if possible.
I've a pigeonhole in the Union
Office, or you can get in touch
via Physics letter-racks.
Cheers.

Rag
Chairman
The largest part of the money
raised by Rag last year has gone
to the National Deaf Children's
Society, who have been buying
radio-hearing aids which put
deaf children in better touch
with their teachers and parents.
We have had twenty letters over
the summer from branches of
N D C S , parents and some fromk
the children, saying thanks to
everyone at IC for raising the
money. Here's an example:
Dear Students
My name is Kim. I am eight
years old. I have just received a
radio hearing aid for which you
raised the funds.
I can't tell you how delighted I
was when I opened the parcel,
and what a difference it will
make when I return to school.
I am sure you must all have
worked very hard to raise the
money for this hearing aid, and
in return I can only promise that
I won't forget your kindness and
I will continue to work very hard
at my schoolwork. Best wishes.
Love from Kim.
This year we'll still be giving
to N D C S , but the amount will
probably be smaller due to the
hassles about licences. Rag
Week has in the past been in
November and been a great
time—but not raised too much
money. This year it's going to be
inspiring, to give time to get
some sponsored events going—
and will be voider for Exec
Torture!
W e ' l l still be c o l l e c t i n g
throughout the y e a r — d o n ' t
forget to wink your tiddle on
Saturday, but for some of the
collections, the money will go
straight to the charities instead
of through our accounts.

Parking Permits
See list elsewhere in F E L I X
(please tell me if any of the
detail^ are wrong!) Desperate
appeals up until next Friday—
but your only chance is someone
who no longer wants a permit—
and there is still a Reserve List
for deserving cases.
Permits should be available
from the Union Office. Those
for zones within the College
Barrier will also need a key card,
f o r w h i c h a £5 d e p o s i t is
required. If at any time during
the term you find your place
occupied by someone else's car
D O N O T park in the nearest
available space so that a domino
effect of misparking occurs, D O
N O T park in front of it so that
no-one can get past, I N S T E A D
go and see the traffic warden at
the gate, or, if he is doing his
rounds, the security officer in
Sherfield and get directions to
the Visitor's Car Park on the
southern side of College. The
traffic warden will then also
know to stick a large, difficult to
remove, sign over the offender's
car window
Key cards for out of hours
parking will be available from
the Chief Security Officer (room
165, Sherfield) for a deposit of
£2.
Old key cards for the Prince
Consort Road barrier, are now
defunct and those who have still
got these cards might as well
return them and get their deposit
back.
