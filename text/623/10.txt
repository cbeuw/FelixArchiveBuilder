A Knight To
Remember
Don Quixote A play by Keith Dewhurst
from the novel by Cervantes. Directed by
Bill Bryden, The Olivier, National
Theatre.
If a great play cannot be produced from a
great novel, as is often claimed, then one is at
least entitled to expect a good play from such a
book. The production of D o n Quixote at the
National is such a play. The director Keith
Dewhurst deserves full credit for his courage
and daring. N o t only is C e r v a n t e s ' book
generally recognised as one of the world's
great literary masterpieces (many have gone
so far as to say that it is the world's greatest
novel), but one would have expected that its
sheer size (over one thousand pages of small
print in the Penguin Classics edition) would
have prohibited any attempt at its distillation
into a two and a half hour production.
In all, twenty-six scenes are taken from this
immortal and universal book, chronicling the
adventures of D o n Q u i x o t e , a splendidly
heroic figure but much given to spectacular
a n d u n b r i d l e d f a n t a s y , a n d his faithful
companion, Sancho Panza. The play contains
some of the more well-known and amusing
encounters of the Knight, including "the most
terrifying and never-to-be-imagined adventure
of the w i n d m i l l s " in w h i c h D o n Q u i x o t e
mistakes the sails as limbs of giants, the inn
which he mistakes for a castle, the wandering
sheep he mistakes for attacking armies,
' M o n t e s i n o s ' P r o f o u n d C a v e ' a n d its
supernatural mysteriousness and the 'Merry
A d v e n t u r e of the Puppet M a n , with the
Memorable Soothsaying of the Prophesying
Ape'. (Oh what great stuff this all is!)

Quick Change
Corruption
Our Friends in the North by Peter
Flannery, Royal Shakespeare Company
at the Pit, Barbican Centre. Directed by
John Caird.
Our Friends in the North is a combination of
political thriller and social drama with a central
theme of corruption in British public life. The
play covers the years 1964 to 1979 and
features local politics in the northeast, the
M e t r o p o l i t a n Police in L o n d o n , and the
Rhodesia at the time of the oil embargo. O n
first sight, these three subjects seem too
weighty to be c o m b i n e d in a single play.
Paul Schofield plays Don Quixote and Tony
Haygarth Sancho Panza, but Don Quixote's
horse, Rozinante, and his companion's mule,
f a i t h f u l D a p p l e , are ' r e p l a c e d ' in t h i s
production by a splendid penny-farthing and a
mini tricycle. These delightful constructions
are the vehicles of their dreams on which they
sally forth in their quest for adventure. Paul
Scofield's portrayal of D o n Q u i x o t e as a
fanatical Knight Errant in maniacal pursuit of
knight errantry is comic but utterly endearing.
The Don's extravagant fantasies and romantic
ideas belong to a former, Golden Age, an age
of 'peace, amity and concord'. N o longer in
existence, the Order of Knighthood defended
damsels, p r o t e c t e d widows and assisted
orphans. In the manner of a saint, D o n
. Quixote undertakes chivalrous adventures in
order to be worthy of the fair Lady Dulcinea.
He much admires this lady whom he considers
chaste and beautiful, but is in reality none
other than Aldonza Lorenzo, the fastest salter
of pig-meat in the locality. In contrast, Sancho
Panza possesses much more down-to-earth
common sense, but remains paradoxically
with his fanciful master because of the promise
of the governorship of an island in those far off
lands which the Don imagines conquering.
Although the play has certain faults and
shortcomings it is nevertheless very amusing
and has many magical moments (witness a
string of sheep on roller-skates). A n excellent
band gives musical and vocal accompaniment:
some of them are well-known folk musicians:
Martin Carthy, Bill Caddick and Maddy Prior.
It is the comedy on one side of the coin and the
deep, deep sadness of the human condition on
the other that is so cleverly and entertaingly
portrayed by Cervantes in his book (and after
all, there is a little bit of Don Quixote in each of
us). If you haven't read the book, the play at
the Olivier Theatre makes a memorable
introduction.
Nick Bedding
Get out of that, Rhodesia! Joseph Marcell
(black), David Whittaker (white).
However, they are unified politically by the
corruption theme and socially by two of the
leading characters, Nicky (Phillip Walsh) and
Geordie (David Whittaker) who pass from
naivety to diri!lusionme<r during the play.
These two actors portray a politically 'likely
lads' story with the form, r staying at home and
pursuing a conventional career in Tyneside
politics, whilst the latter is the bad penny who
leaves and follows a less orthodox path.
One of the many joys of this play is the
Herculean task undertakn by the performers
of presenting thirty-four characters between
only about twenty actors. T h i s calls for
quick costume and character changes, with,
for example, James Garbutt playing a flat-
capped working class Geordie, a commissioner
in the Metropolitan Police and a Rhodesia
minister.
This production does not require an interest
in politics to be appreciated.
Student standby tickets may be obtained for
this play which continues through October
and November.

H a n k y P a n k y , a film d i r e c t e d b y S i d n e y
Poitier, at the C l a s s i c , C h e l s e a .
Having recently gone on general release, the
latest " a l l action c o m e d y - a d v e n t u r e " (sic)
featuring Gene Wilder as our innocent blue-
eyed hero, Hanky Panky will contain few
surprises and few laughs to those cognoscenti
of the genre.
Directed once more by Sidney Poitier, this
film makes their previous effort Silver Streak
appear positively classic. The approach is the
same: a woolly plot based around big business
espionage and murder catching up with our
innocent hero, while he pursues carnal rather
than financial aims. The plot is deliberately left
loose as a framework for plenty of farcical
humour. "However, where Silver Streak scored
was to have Gene Wilder playing off Richard
Prior, a superb â€¢ talent in his own right. In
Hanky Panky; this element is missing. His
female co-star (whose name escapes me) has a
stronger role than the previous film: she is
n o t a b l e for her a d e p t n e s s as a m o t o r -
mechanic as well as a sex-symbol. Indeed, only
overtime work by the make-up department
makes her role as object of our hero's desires
credible.
I hope M r Wilder will move off to more fertile
ground for his next film and that this will mark
the low point in the film career of this talented
performer. He seemed to thrive under the
direction of M e l B r o o k s (remember The
Producers and Blazing Saddles) and I hope he.
manages one day to recapture that form. So
unless you are a devotee of undemanding rib-
ticklers, stear clear of this banal offering.
