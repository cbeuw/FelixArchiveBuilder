Socialist Society present Ken
Livingstone, leader of the G L C ,
who will be speaking on 'The
G L C and London Transport'.
-Few local government lead-
ers can have been in the
news as often as Ken
Livingstone leader of the
GLC. His 'Fares Fair' policy
for London Transport has
caused enormous controversy
since the Law Lords ruled
that it was illegal. Even if you
don't agree with what is said
this talk will be interesting,
lively and witty. This man's
policy affets you, so make
sure you attend what should
be one of the highlights of
the week.

people with a cut throat razor
this is for you. This film
