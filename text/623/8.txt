This week FELIX presents a special film review section which looks at the latest
releases and gives a guide to films which you may have missed over the holiday
period.
This may help you to sift through the hundreds of films showing in London and
choose a quiet evenings entertainment after the first hectic week.
furniture, breaking glass, etc—but things start
to turn nasty when the old knarled tree outside
the c h i l d r e n ' s b e d r o o m trie's to c o n s u m e
young Robbie during a 'freak' thunderstorm. In
the confusion their young daughter Carol
Anne, who has been talking to the what she
calls ' T V people' (ie the spirits), disappears
c o m p l e t e l y , only to manifest herself as a
frightened voice on an u n u s e d television
channel. She had been abducted to the spirit
world and, in much the same way as Close
Encounters, the family have to get her back.
All this is marvellously done, but then the
film changes gear. Steve consults a team of
parapsychologists who, spouting a mixture of
science and religious gobbledy-gook, explain
that they have been plagued by a poltergeist. A t
this point the story begins to get confused—Dr
L e s h (Beatrice Straight) e x p l a i n s that a
poltergeist is not associated with a building (as
with a haunting) but with a person. Spielberg
promptly ignores this and juxtaposes three or
f o u r p l o t s i n t o o n e to c r e a t e a f i n a l
conflugration which has nothing to do with a
poltergeist, but rather a haunting.
A s the parapsychologists call in midget
psychic Tangina (Zelda Rubenstein) to, rescue
Carol Anne from the spirit world, they witness
some spectular events, all created for the
screen in immaculate style by George Lucas'
. effects team at Industrial Light and Magic.
Indeed, the weakness of the plot is made up for
enormously by the stunning visuals and some
cheeky humour, which combine to make this a
quaintly horrific but undemanding film.
M y only criticism of the film (apart from the
m i s l e a d i n g title) is t h a t it c a r r i e s an X
certificate. Poltergeist is basically a ' W a l t
Disney' horror film designed to have mass
appeal, and thus it seems odd that it was not
made as a A A feature. Don't get me wrong, it
is hugely entertaining and very scary at times
(especially the lingering gap between the two
'endings') but apart from one small scene there
T o b e H o o p e r s h o t to fame w i t h the
controversial cult hit The Texas Chainsaw
Massacre and his latest film Poltergeist (X,
E m p i r e L e i c e s t e r S q u a r e a n d l o c a l s ) is
currently London's top-selling film.
A s you may have heard already there has
been a certain amount of controversy over this
film too, centring not on the horror elements,
but on who actually directed it. The confusion
has a r i s e n b e c a u s e w u n d e r k i n d S t e v e n
S p i e l b e r g h a d a great i n f l u e n c e on the
project—he wrote the screenplay from his own
story and produced the film. Indeed his name
dominates the credits so much that the press
have tended to ignore Tobe Hooper's hard
work and credit Spielberg for directing the
picture too. H e denies this—end of story?
The confusion is easy to understand though.

Spielberg stamp, from the setting in a middle
class American suburb to the obsession with
mysteries and child-like sense of wonder. It
tells the story of the Freeling family, whose
world is turned upside down when a spirit
(supposedly a poltergeist) enters their home
through a television.
Property salesman Steve Freeling (Craig T
Nelson) his wife Diane (Jobeth Williams) and
their three children then start to witness a
series of s t a n d a r d magic t r i c k s — m o v i n g

appeal to the young at heart or those who are
fans of o u t s t a n d i n g special effects. Still,
recommended.
live in fear!" A few lines like these are priceless
indications of the depth in the film's story. The
single greatest improvement is in the character
of Roy Batty (Ruger Hauer) the leader of the
replicants. Hauer dominates the latter half of
the film with an unnerving, evil performance
culminating in a powerful cat and mouse game
with the terrified Deckard.
Director Ridley Scott (right) instructing Harrison Ford on the set of Blade Runner. This scene is a direct
homage to Ray Bradbury's classic Outer Limits episode Fiend with the Glass Hand.
Jobeth Williams is confronted by a ghostly apparition in Tobe Hooper's Poltegeist.
A more important, if flawed, film is Ridley
Scott's Blade Runner (AA, Warner, A B C
F u l h a m R d , A B C S h a f t e s b u r y A v e n u e )
starring Harrison Ford. This is fairly directly
based on Philip K Dick's excellent science
fiction novel D o Androids Dream of Electric
Sheep? Dick was a gifted author who used the
S F medium to express his own slightly views
on reality and life.
Here futuristic bounty hunter Rick Deckard
( F o r d ) is sent to kill four ' r e p l i c a n t s ' —
genetically engineered people w h o have
illegally returned to earth. In the process of
hunting them down he starts to doubt not only
tiis profession, but also the place of androids in
his society. The film is set in the next century
in a beautifully crafted city; flying cars fill the
polluted skies and the overcrowded streets
b u s t l e w i t h a p r e d o m i n a n t l y o r i e n t a l
c o m m u n i t y . M a n has a d v a n c e d genetic
engineering to the stage where he can produce
perfect, dispensible copies of himself as
slaves—androids, which are only used 'off
world' to spearhead the colonisation of outer
space.
The replicants are very strong, but have
little experience of life and poorly developed
emotions. For this reason they become erratic
and their inventor, Tyrell (Joe Turkell), gives
his latest Nexus 6 models artificial memories
with a brief four year life span as a safety
measure. When six Nexus 6 replicants hijack a
shuttle and return to earth they become a
danger and must be elliminated.
The film retains most of the passion for life
which Dick's book expresses so well and it
even improves on it slightly. "There's nothing
worse than having an itch you can never
scratch!" mouths Leon as he tries to brutally
kill Deckard, " N o w you know what it's like to
The film is visually stunning with a look
which is a cross between Scott's Alien and
Spielberg's Close Encounters (not surprising
as Douglas Trumball supplies the magnificent
special effects were too) but it does have
obvious faults.
Those who dislike serious science fiction
may as well forget it straight away. Despite
some concessions to commercial pressures
(an u n n e c e s s a r y n a r r a t i o n a n d s l i g h t l y
overblown violence) the story projects a very
serious, if gloomy, point about life and death. It
requires some effort to understand and those
expecting Indiana Jones vs The Robots merely
because Harrison Ford stars will come away
disappointed. Indeed, A m e r i c a n audiences
were generally disappointed by Ford and not
the film itself (he gives a reasonable performance
as a terrified anti-hero, who is constantly
overpowered by his superior adversaries not
Indiana Jones at all!).
Y o u won't come out of this one feeling
e l a t e d , but I'm c o n v i n c e d that it is an
important step towards putting more serious
science fiction back on the big screen.
So far I seem to have only raved about the
summer's good releases, so here's a warning
about some less desireable films.
The most disappointing film of the summer
was certainly Conan The Barbarian starring
Arnold Schwarzeneggar. Despite glimpses of
promise, it really is a monumental bore, with
John Milius wasting a decent story by banal
scripting and unimaginative filming. Conan
mumbles incomprehensibly and every time
s o m e o n e gets on a horse the o r c h e s t r a l
soundtrack wheezes back into cliched 'riding
boldly' format. It reminded me of a two hour
title s e q u e n c e p e r f o r m e d by a c a s t of
characterless dummies.

Far less disappointing, but still bad in a
sense was John Carpenter's The Thing (X,
A B C s ) , supposedly a remake of the classic
Howard Hawk's film The Thing From Another t
World. I can honestly say that the special
effects totally overwhelm the pitiful story—but
boy oh boy, you just will not believe your eyes!
Effects w i z a r d R i c k B a k e r (of A m e r i c a n
Werewolf in London fame) has conspired to
produce the most sickeningly repulsive and
horrific set of convincing effects I have ever
seen. This is a new type of horror—let's say
' h a r d c o r e ' h o r r o r — w h i c h is far m o r e
interesting and physically moving than any of
the recent glut of slash the teenager movies.
But as one reviewer has already said—Things
just ain't what they used to be (groan!).
Denis Potter's play Brimstone & Treacle
(X, C l a s s i c s H a y m a r k e t , O x f o r d St) was
originally intended for the B B C , but its film
incarnation with Sting in the lead role of
Martin Taylor (which one, I hear you ask in
unison) turns out surprisingly well.
Filmed virtually competely in a small house,
it has the feel of a play and may have been
better set on the stage. It opens with Martin
bumping into Thomas Bates (Denholm Elliot)
and talking his way into the Bates' home. H e
pretends to be a friend of their daughter, who
for three years has been a helpless mute since
an unfortunate accident. The beautiful young
girl cannot feed herself or communicate with
the outside world and so when Martin offers to
help look after his long lost love, M r s Bates
seizes on the chance to relieve the constant
pressure of work.
M r Bates is less enthusiastic. H e suspects
Martin's ruse and fears the worst, but is
eventually won over. Meanwhile Sting is busy
molesting his daughter in the living room.

The film is interesting and well shot, but
was a little too short. The sudden ending
manages to carry the central point of the
p l a y — t h a t g o o d a n d evil are not totally
distinguishable and that some thoroughly evil
a c t s m a y h a v e g o o d (if e m b a r r a s s i n g )
consequences. Whilst not being too explicit,
the morality of Martin Taylor's actions is
sometimes surprising (I always had my doubts
about him) even shocking.
A s for Sting, it is very fortunate that he has
to look as if he's acting most of the time
V
The initial reaction when watching Diva is
mixed; it opens with a ten minute opera scene
where a postboy illegally records his favourite
star Diva, a woman who refuses to make
recordings for sale. Later he also comes into
possession of a tape which exposes a drug
syndicate and ends up being pursued by just
about everybody.
Whilst the plot may at first seem fairly
simple, it turns into a complex and unusual
thriller of Hitchcock proportions, which is very
well crafted and beautifully filmed. It is these
qualities w h i c h have r o c k e t e d its F r e n c h
d i r e c t o r , J e a n - J a q u e s B e i n e i x to instant
stardom.
Beineix has combined a series of simple
plots to provide a stylish film with a certain
dreamlike quality. The postboy is pursued by
d a n g e r o u s t h u g s a n d o r i e n t a l g a n g s t e r s
through a world populated by comic strip
characters and incredible pop-art backdrops.
The look of the film, switching between night
time P a r i s a n d almost s u r r e a l sets, is all
important and I don't think I can recommend
this odd film highly enough. It is now showing
exclusively at the Odeon High St Kensington
and the Screen on the Hill at Belsize Park.
Equally impressive, if far less exciting is
W e r n e r H e r z o g ' s epic Fitzcarraldo (A,
Camden Plaza). This is a hugely ambitious film
set in S o u t h A m e r i c a at the turn of the
century.

F i t z g e r a l d ( k n o w n as F i t z c a r r a l d o ) , a n
Irishman obsessed by the notion of building an
opera house in the jungle. To do this he hits
upon several fanciful schemes, culminating in a
plan w h i c h i n v o l v e s d r a g g i n g a m a s s i v e
riverboat over a hill to reach an otherwise
inaccessible supply of rubber. This he achieves
with considerable effort, but his crazy scheme
is doomed to failure.
The film is all about obsession and the story
of its production is interesting, in itself. For htis
reason maverick documentary maker Les
Blank (do you remember Garlic is as good as
10 mothers or Werner Herzog Eats his Shoe?)

the Paris Pullman. This shows the pains to
which Herzog went to film the story. H e

A m a z o n i a n jungle a n d , despite n u m e r o u s
setbacks, eventually succeeded in pulling a full
size boat over a hill. Herzog confesses that he
sometimes doubted his own sanity and the
documentary is a testament to his brilliance as
an obsessive film maker.
