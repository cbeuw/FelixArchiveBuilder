Advanced
Contraception
Dear Martin
Although I greatly appreciate
the venture of F E L I X into the
Welfare field last week with the
photograph of advanced contra-
ceptive equipment, I was dis-
appointed that there were not
more descriptive details in the
caption to the photo. I would
like to correct this by making the
following facts known through
your columns (or in F E L I X if
you find it too painful).
Firstly, it must be pointed out
that the torch is not an essential
part of the equipment, but if it is
to fee included then instructions
for use must be followed to the
letter. These things are best
demonstrated so I am offering to
demonstrate correct operation
of a torch if anyone approaches
me with a current copy of
F E L I X .
It was thoughtless of you to
omit to say that contraception is
always improved if both partners
use protection. You should there-
fore have pointed out that you
were in fact illustrating only the
equipment designed for the
male. A n equivalent is also
available for females and is
s t r o n g l y r e c o m m e n d e d . It
consists of India rubber long-
johns, perspex Liberty bodice
and damp galoshes. I do not
however k n o w where such
garments can be obtained.
I hope in the future there will
be more consultation before this
sort of project is repeated by
F E L I X but I must commend
you on your initiative.
Yours in an advanced state of
decay,
Jon Barnett
Foul Fare
Dear FELIX
Er I don't like to ask
awkward questions...but then
again—I didn't design it, I just
use it, so how can I be expected
to know? What's happened to
the Great New Refectory Outlet
we were all expecting?
The Refectory has been put in
another room. The set of plastic
tables has been replaced by
another set of plastic tables. The
walls are another colour....but
what's the difference?
It's just as inefficient. The
food's just as bad. The same
bored women serve it up and it's
still as expensive!
Maybe it's just me—maybe I
missed the article explaining
what the differences are?

Ents and
Mines
Dear Sir
I write as a relieved Minesman
following the huge success of all
the Mines' freshers' events of last
week. This success could have
been possibly jeopardised by the
abominable attempt by those
purveyors of false self-grati-
fication IC Ents, who attempted
to lead freshers astray as early as
Sunday evening by selling their
own 'all encompassing money-
saving tickets.' This attempt to
pervert IC freshers (to my
dismay, even some RSMfreshers)
before the rest of us have even
had a chance to get our hands on
them. Fortunately we were able
to have the foresight to ban the
sale of tickets in R S M and
organise the passing on of those
tickets that had been bought by
RSM freshers unsuspectingly on
the Sunday, to other unsus-
pecting freshers (RCS).
I would like to finish by saying
this is not a slag on the quality or
content of any of the IC Ents
freshers' events, but simply on
the way in which the tickets were
sold, and the fact that R S M was
not asked in any way to contri-
bute to those events. A bit
biased, don't you think?
Yours

Poison in
the Poison
Dear Sir
I wonder how many of your
readers have heard about the
horrible Tylenol scare which
took place in the U S A only last
week—seven lives were claimed
in the Chicago area by cyanide
having been put in capsules in
place o f the very p o p u l a r
analgesic extra strength Tylenol.
Now, I don't wish to cause a
panic, and with reason and
common sense the whole explo-
sive s i t u a t i o n can well be
defused, since there is still time
to act, but the following hap-
pened to me only this morning: I
was looking for a particular

Here's the new look diary column;
hope you approve. As I wrote last
issue, I hope to produce it weekly,
but I can only do this if I'm
regularly supplied with gripes and
gossips. All contributions should
be sent to Below the Belt, FELIX,
and naturally will be dealt with in
strictest confidence if you so
desire.
H O W P L E A S A N T to have a
U n i o n President with some
.character to him! I don't mean
this as any kind of criticism of
last y e a r ' s P r e s i d e n t N i c k
M o r t o n ; N i c k was cheerful,
h a r d - w o r k i n g , h e l p f u l and
altogether a thoroughly pleasant
person, but without any real
quirks that a newspaper diarist
c o u l d write a b o u t . In the
previous year John Passmore
was lazy, Irish, and frequently
drunk, but there it stopped.
Neither of them had any of the
style of Stephen Goulder who,'
with his felt hat, his slightly affec-
ted pomposity, and his wonderful
use of the English language, is
already making quite a name for
himself as a gentlemanly eccen-
tric.
He is also a master of the
oblique insult. His desciption of
one of the C C U presidents as
"not exactly overburdened with
grey matter" was so much more
eloquent than simply describing
him as thick, and his put-down
of former F E L I X Editor Steve
Marshall was nothing short of
masterly. "Steve," he announced,
" y o u have what they call a
magnetic personality—you repel
people!"
So when Dramsoc hack 'Eric'
Jarvis wrote a widely-praised
letter to the postgrad F E L I X
supporting M a r y Freeman's
attitudes and criticising the
President as a pompous, self-
admiring fool, I was surprised to
hear S D G mutter something
about the letter containing " a
bone of t r u t h . " It isn't his
admission which surprises me so
much as the word bone. Is this a
special presidential ossiform
truth, as opposed to the granular
truth the rest of us understand?
M A R Y F R E E M A N has, since
before the start of term, been
pestering members of U n i o n
Council for their photographs to
include in next week's F E L I X .
One wag presented me with this
picture;
I have undertaken not to
name the disloyal fellow con-
cerned, provided he sends a
better likeness by Monday, but I
will award a Jingles haircut
voucher (my God, the generos-
ity) to the first person who
correctly identifies the hirsute
young lady of the photograph.
M O R E N E W S of our old friend
Captain Lindley R N (retd). The
Captain is Domestic Secretary at
IC and is therefore adminis-
trative superior to such as M r
Mooney, the Refectories Mana-
ger and M r Reeves, C h i e f
Security Officer. He is also no
friend of F E L I X , largely due to
the efforts of the two previous
editors.
The Captain is due for a well-
deserved retirement in December,
but over the summer several
Union hacks and a reliable mole
in Sherfield phoned the F E L I X
Office and gleefully announced
that the retirement had been
brought forward to September.
Not one to print unsubstantiated
rumour (despite recommenda-
tions from a former editor)
F E L I X phoned Jolly J a c k ' s
secretary who coldly told us that
