Last week both Guildsheet and the H G Wells
Society used pictures of the female form to
attract cheap publicity. The women's group
WIST, among others, were offended, and this
week two of WIST's officers reply, asking
Why must you be
so childish?
In reply to last week's article 'WIST Drive Fails' we would like to put a
few facts right and expand a little on the motion which was to have been
put forward at the first U G M . Firstly WIST cannot be described solely
as a women's rights group, since we aim to provide information about
such varied topics as woman's culture (including film, theatre, music,
etc), her involvement in politics, economics, society. We also try to
voice the opinions of women at this otherwise male orientated college.

The two main images used in
the picture: firstly, the woman

put forward the fact that both
female a n d male students found
one of the Well Soc postc. used
in Freshers' Week, offensive.

this unnecessary form of publicity
purely as an object of lust, a n d
s e c o n d l y the stereotype ' H e -

trying to attract freshers who see
themselves in this light.
Is Wellsoc trying to discourage
women from joining? O r , is it
Susan Walts, WIST spokesperson:
"We hope you will support us in
stopping such irresponsible
behaviour.''
trying to w i n an exclusively male
audience, by appealing directly
t o s t e r e o t y p e m a l e s e x u a l
fantasies? This appears contrary
to t h e i r s a y i n g i n the Union
Handbook: " T h i s is the society,
the one where everyone's face
f i t s , n o m a t t e r w h a t t h e i r
interests, creed o r c o l o u r o r
political allegiance." W e also
understand that it is not c o m -
mon practise amongst publcity
officers, to use pictures which
are totally irrelevant to their
society in order to advertise its
existance. Another instance of
this however, was brought to our
attention in the first cover of
Guildsheet. T h e t h o u g h t l e s s
f r o n t cover o f a s e m i - n a k e d

Wellsoc poster a n d Guildsheet
front page give a sadly childish
impression of I C students to the
freshers, a n d that the people
responsible for it are not helping
College in its aim to attract more
women into all departments.
We hope that many of you
will come to the next U G M to
discuss the motion on U n i o n
Publicity (we need at least 300
people just to be able to discuss
the motion) and gives us your
support in stopping such irres-

The following four people will be eligible for a parking permit when
they know the (full) registration number of their car:
Almuhanna Geology 1982
Bull Man Sci MSc
Dhaliwal Maths 7
Walls Mining 3
Transit Officer C&G
Transit Officer RCS
Transit Officer Mines
Four Union vans out-'T'e gate reg nos: OBW 886W; GGP 670P;
RGO 716V; PGT 563,
To those who have not been allocated permits I can only say, hard
luck. It was a heartbreaking job sorting through them on Monday
night after the rest of the Exec sorted out most of them on Sunday
night. Thank you to the person applying from Holbein House who
made me laugh after all of that!
Seriously though, those who are lucky enough to be living close
to College already; in either Westminster Council or Kensington
and Chelsea Council areas, can apply for a 'Resident's Parking
Permit' to the appropriate Council. You do not have had to live in
the district for a specific time and, I have been informed, the
permits cost only about £10 a term. The address of the Council
should be in the telephone directory.
To those who were hoping to offer lifts to female flatmates in
Kensington/Hamlet Gardens, firstly, these areas are relatively well
lit and residential and therefore safer than most, secondly, if you're
worried (and I know that sometimes I was very scared walking
back to Evelyn Gardens at midnight after working late) then there
should be Rape 'Alarms' available, free, from the Union Office as
soon as they arrive (hopefully they should have at the time you are
reading this). There are also some on sale in the Bookshop.
