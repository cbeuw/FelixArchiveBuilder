Orienteering
The club went to its first event o f
the year last Sunday in B u r n h a m
Beeches, near Slough. T h e going
was a bit wet, a n d there were a
few too many brambles for some
people. However, almost every-
one completed the long course,
9.5km, with two people going
round the shorter courses, there
w e r e n o o u t s t a n d i n g r e s u l t s
though.

evidently inspired by the sweat
from the still dirty first team
shirts the 2nd X I produced a
performance boardering o n the
a l m o s t c o m p e t e n t . N P L o b -
viously overawed by the Eldrige
p r e - m a t c h t r a i n i n g s e s s i o n ,
which left most of the team o n
their backs, allowed I C to take
control a n d i n a rapid counter-
a t t a c k r e m i n i s c e n t o f G o o s e
Green, Payne crossed the ball
allowing Witter to score a well-
taken goal.
After half-time I C decided it
had been a day's work well done
and allowed N P L to play as well.
Some stolid defence ensued but
after a series o f short corners
N P L finally managed a shot o n
target a n d honesty prevented
Whitehead from kicking the ball
off the line twice i n the match.
So the sun set o n the final ten
minutes o f the match with only
E l d r i g e s v o i c e s p u r r i n g o n a
team spoiling the serenity o f a
lovely autumn evening.

on Sunday I C lsts beat R o y a l
Free a n d Kings by 2-0; drew
with Chelsea II a n d lost 0-1 to
St. Georges. Unfortunately we
did not qualify for the semi-
finals.
A typical I C poor turn-out
meant that we h a d to borrow a
few players f r o m St Georges to
make up a second team. 1-0
losses were s u s t a i n e d a g a i n s t
R o y a l Free, U C H a n d Barts but
we d i d manage a 0-0 draw with
St Thomas.
Some o f our players have been
invited to U L U trials a n d as

serve a bloody medal for turning
up at 8:00 o n a Sunday any-
