continued
room high up in the Elec Eng
building when I unwittingly
stumbled upon a conspiracy of a
very similar sort to the one
above. What sounded like three
distinct male voices were saying
behind closed doors that within
two weeks everything would be
ready, all the inside contacts
would have been made, to insert
quantities of strychnine into
r a n d o m portions of College
refectory food. For fear of my
own safety, I fled before the
meeting was over, and so was
not able to hear any more
detailed information, or discover
the identities of these criminals.
Obviously, sir, this is a very
serious matter, and I refer it to
the proper authorities. Let me
just make the point, however,
that in the U S A the parent
company of the Tylenol makers,
Johnson and Johnson, acted to
withdraw its entire stock of these
analgesic capsules from the
market soon after the outbreak
of the poisonings. Perhaps a
s i m i l a r p r e v e n t i v e measure
ought to be taken.
Yours sincerely

my real name)

Hypocrisy
A wonderful letter in this week's
Broadsheet deserves a wider
audience; in it, Miss Deborah
C o o p e r tells how no less a
person than Phil Nathan en-
c o u r a g e d her to advertise
sweatshirts by parading herself
dressed in nothing but a sweat-
shirt a n d u n d e r w e a r ( R C S
nymphet reveals all?). I am not
offended by this, although I do
see that many people may be;
but I do condemn most strongly
Mr Nathan's hypocrisy in doing
this and then condemning sexist
behaviour at the RCS U G M .
U G M s
This is rather old news now, but
I would still like to congratulate
N i c k P y n e on the way he
handled the U G M a week ago;
despite a few technical slips. He
made it clear that his aim was to
get through the agenda quickly
and democratically without
letting wrangling pedants bog
the meeting down. What a pity
so few people were there; could
it be because at the RCS U G M
the previous Monday (which was
packed) Karl Schmidt chaired
the meeting so badly?
Other Publications
There are still several copies of
the postgrad F E L I X , last week's
F E L I X , some old Phoenixes,
and the Event London Student
Guide. Anyone who would like
copies can help themselves from
the F E L I X Office.
Next Week
Next week's F E L I X will contain
the photographs of the people
who have the dubious privilege
of sitting on Union Council;
photographs must be handed in
to Mary Freeman, please, by
Monday 5:30pm, or I may print
something less complimentary in
their place.
FELIX Blues
Apologies to those of you who
have a calendar in which the
colours aren't properly regist-
ered. We've had an enormous
amount of trouble with the
colour machine, and in addition
to all the production apparatus
going wrong (which we've grown
to expect) and our suppliers
letting us down (ditto) we've
been plagued with little irrit-
ations like the telephones being
out of order, the lights failing in
the print room, and (I kid you
not) someone walking into the
office and stealing artwork that
was about to be printed.
F E L I X Staff
We still need a n y b o d y and
everybody who can spare the
odd hour to help, particularly if
y o u are free on T h u r s d a y
afternoons. About forty people
signed up as being 'interested' at
Freshers' Fair. If you're still
'interested' in spending some
time working on F E L I X (how-
ever little or irregularly) then
come to the staff meeting at
12:45 t o d a y in the F E L I X
office, at any time except]
Thursday (when it is part of the ]
Editor's job to panic and be bad-
tempered).
Impossible Without
N i c k T h e x t o n , Lee P a d d o n ,
Petra Barry, Mark Smith, Tim
Noyce, Peter Rodgers, Dave
Rowe, Phil Greenstreet, and
Nick Pyne for pasting-up and
doing other jobs which are less
than exhilarating, Pinocchio and
Walkabout-Looksee for their
respective columns, Dave Parry,
Ramzi Shammas, Steve Bishop
and Mark Heasman for photo-
graphic work, Chris Mallaband
for sport, H u g h Southey for
What's On, Adrian James for
the news, Hazel Cheesbrough
for the only decent contribution
to the Letters page this week
(and for giving me the oppor-
tunity to show I can spell her
surname) and Maz and Peter for
typesetting and printing.

the Captain had no comment to
make.
The rumour turned out to be
false, but that didn't stop the
Captain from being in a foul
temper for weeks, and cross-
e x a m i n i n g even his closest
friends on whether they had
done any writing for what he
calls " t h a t scurrilous news-
paper".
A T L O N G L A S T ex-editor
Steve M a r s h a l l has f o u n d
someone who is prepared to
employ him. No more will the
F E L I X staff hear his nasal,
whining demand for tea (ac-
curately mimicked by the rest of
the staff). No more the rotund
little figure with the expression
of childish glee when someone
takes pity and buys him a
biscuit. No more the withering
contempt for anyone who so
much as hints at an interest in a
woman's charms (for Steve
regards sex as a rather good
joke, and the idea of gaining
pleasure from it is quite strange
to him). No more half-finished
articles for the Daily Mirror, no
more madcap money-making
schemes, no more deliberate
offensiveness to anyone who
dare stand up to his supreme
arrogance. Steve—we shall miss
you greatly, we wish you well
sub-editing the magazine General
Practitioner, a n d we l o o k
forward to seeing you back here
in the evenings.
Now all we have to do is find a
way of getting rid of M a r k
Smith
B U T B E F O R E I leave Steve
Marshall alone (for this week, at
any rate) I feel I should make
some mention of his obstinacy,
and in particular the way in
which, having decided he has a
pretty shrewd idea of valuing
antiques, it is taking the ridicule
of most of the Union to point
out his folly.
His first purchase was a
stuffed antelope head (£20)
which he has donated to F E L I X
and which stares down dis-
approvingly as I write. More
recently a bamboo flowerpot
holder has appeared (£ 13) and is
now residing in the president's
room in Linstead until Steve can
find room for it. Personally I
think it resembles nothing so
much as one of those fairground
amusements that y o u throw
tennis balls into in an attempt to
win a goldfish; but Steve seems
to like it.
But the most appalling, the
most tasteless, the most unat-
tractive purchase to date is a
wrought-iron candlestick in the
shape of a dragon which Steve
paid twenty-five pounds for. This
object is so ghastly that it has
met with the universal detesta-
tion of all who have set eyes on
it, and even Steve himself is
beginning to realise that its
charms aren't quite what he first
took them for. So if anyone has
a use for such an ornament, drop
a note to Steve in the F E L I X
Office. I'm sure he'd accept any
offer around £30.

dubious trophies.
A N D F I N A L L Y , two weeks ago
I received an anonymous letter
with a p h o t o g r a p h attached
which purported to identify the
mascoteers who took Mike over
the summer. Next week I shall
reveal more if my informant tells
me exactly why the photograph
is so incriminating
