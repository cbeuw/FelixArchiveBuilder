Y o u remember the parties at Primelia College?
Well, there was an extra party this weekend,
and Quentin, Richard, Steve and T i m each
took one of Mary, Mandy, Mungo and Midge. I
tried to find out who took who, and elicited the
following responses. Richard said "I didn't go
with Mungo," Quentin said "I didn't go with
Mandy," T i m said "I didn't go with Midge,"
Quentin said "I didn't go with Mary," Steve
said "I didn't go with Mandy". Unfortunately, I
later f o u n d o u t that only o n e of these
statements was true. S o who went with who?
Solutions, comments,criticisms to me at the
FELIX Office by Wednesday, 1:00pm. £5 from
Mend-a-Bike for a randomly selected entry.
Last Week's Solution
Well, no not last week's puzzle, but the one
before that. The correct solution to the puzzle
in F E L I X 621 was:
1st Party: Richard/Mungo, Steve/Midge,
Tim/Mary.
2nd Party: Richard/Midge, Steve/Mungo,
Tim/Mary.
3rd Party: R i c h a r d / M a r y , Steve/Mungo,
Tim/Midge.
4th P a r t y : R i c h a r d / M u n g o , S t e v e / M a r y ,
T i m / M i d g e , a n d t h e w i n n e r , r a n d o m l y
selected, was J Ward of C h e m Eng 1, and the
£5 prize will be in the F E L I X Office on Monday
after 1:00pm.
N o w back to General Reisenschein. Nobody
has produced a correct solution, so the puzzle
will be run for another week. Y o u are required
to dissect a square from which a right-angled
isoscles triangle has been cut (see diagram)
into four congruent shapes.
My only hint is that the following shape,
contrary to popular belief, does in fact have a
continuous perimeter (for proof, see nearly
any mathematician).
Scaramouche's Final Bow
I now also have the solutions to the puzzles
of the last F E L I X of the summer term, all of
them now solved. The winners were: T i m
Pigden (Letters & Figures); K e n M o r i s o n
(Sporting Chance); Simon Morrow (Holding
the B a b y ) ; a n d , G S G i r o l a m i (Banana's
Revenge).
All four win £10, and, if they have not
already done so, they can collect their prizes
from the F E L I X Office. Incidentally, G S
Girolami and Simon Morrow were the only
ones to solve their respective puzzles, so
congratulations to them.
Now for the solutions:

Banana's Revenge
B a n a n a ' s Revenge is s u c h a n incredibly
difficult problem that I'd like to leave the
solution to next week, and to present the
problem to the freshers, and those who missed
F E L I X 618. There's no prize for solving it, but
you may care to know that it took the English
Chess Team, even by their combined efforts,
about a week to do it.
A n old chess-playing computer was set to
play against itself and, although all its moves
are legal, its moves are not always sensible. In
one game it played, white played first, playing
pawn to king 4, and on its fifth move, black
finished the game by knight takes rook, giving
mate. C a n you supply the missing moves?
Holding the Baby
This puzzle, known as the Century puzzle
since it takes exactly one hundred moves,
appeared in the book Winning Ways, reviewed
in F E L I X 620. There is a similar puzzle, known
as the Century-and-a-Half which takes 151
moves, which consists of inverting the shapes
(the first and last moves are only half-moves,
hence the Century-and-a-half). T h e solution is
shown, together with the number of moves
required. By turning the page upside-down
you'll see the only other 100-move solution to
the Century.
