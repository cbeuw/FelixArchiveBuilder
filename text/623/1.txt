The Rector has revealed that if the plans to charge IC students for use
of the Science Museum Library go ahead, the library's rent will be
drastically increased, says the Union's External Affairs Officer Simon
Rodan.
In last week's F E L I X the
.proposals to charge students
thirty pence per book were
described, and the article went
on to describe the U n i o n ' s
official protest at this. L o r d
Flowers has now told I C U
President Stephen Goulder that
he opposes the charges and
a d d e d that in view of the
Government's policy on further
education spending, the College
would have to re-assess its
expenditure on certain external
institutions—unless the propo-
sals were shelved. M r Rodan has
interpreted this as meaning that
the library's overheads, which
until now have been heavily
subsidised by the College, would
rise suddenly.
In a letter to M r Goulder last
week, College Secretary John
Smith said that he had not heard
of the Union's protest until he
read F E L I X , but that he will be
happy to liaise with the Union in
any further action that they may
wish to take.
At present the library occupies
a rent-free site on campus, and
IC pays all its heating and
lighting bills. The proposed
additional charge is the result of
a report by Sir Derek George
Rayner (a director of Marks &
Spencer) who has been appointed
by the Government to look into
reducing public sector spending.

Bumper Week for
Thieves at IC
There has been a record number of thefts in the College in the past two
weeks, despite repeated warnings from the Security department and a
safety-conscious speech from the Rector.
Since Lord Flowers' intro-
ductory speech to freshers on
October 4, six bicycles, seven
wallets, and various cheque-
books, cards, purses and items
of electrical equipment have
been stolen. The total value of
the bicycles alone is over £600,
and C h i e f S e c u r i t y O f f i c e r
Geoffrey Reeves is requesting all
students who park their bicycles
in the College to register them at
the Security Office on Level 1 of
the Sherfield Building next week.
Students should give a short
description of their machine,
including make, colour and
frame number. This will make
recognition and recovery of
bicycles a great deal easier if they
are stolen; at present very few
owners can give an accurate

So far, bicycles have been
