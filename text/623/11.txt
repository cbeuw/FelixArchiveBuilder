The Victoria & Albert Museum, at the bottom
of Exhibition Road, started life as the Museum
of Manufacturers, with a government grant of
£5,000 to buy ornamental art from the Great
Exhibition of 185J. Today, the museum houses
a huge collection which ranges from ceramics
and musical instruments, to tapestries and
prints.
The Jewellery Gallery has been closed since
November 1977, when it was found to be full of
toxic blue asbestos! It reopened last week to
show its sparkling permanent display, which
includes ornaments from the Russian Crown
Jewels, and the famous C a n n i n g J e w e l ,
traditionally said to have been given by a
Medici prince to a Mughal emperor. This
treasure-house of a gallery is also intended to
house occasional small exhibitions of modern
jewellery: the first is an exhibition of work by
Wendy Ramshaw.
T h e jewellery on show results from a
collaboration with Wedgewood. She is the first
artist-jeweller to work with Wedgewood in the
company's 222 years. In the catalogue to the
exhibition she says: "I wanted to make pieces
of jewellery which carried some of the vitality

of so-called 'primitive' body ornament. I also
wished to relate to 20th century form and
technology. The collaboration with Wedge-
wood afforded the chance of using the famous
B l a c k B a s a l t . . . r e p u t e d to have the most
excellent turning properties. In the event most
of the pieces were made with the other famous
W e d g e w o o d clay, J a s p e r , a dense white
vitrified stoneware body having much the
same properties as porcelain."
Her beads are perfect geometric shapes:
cones, spheres, hemispheres, and discs, and
also, cotton-reel and bobbin shapes. This basic
vocabulary is arranged in varying degrees of
c o m p l e x i t y , s o m e t i m e s c o m b i n e d w i t h
p r e c i o u s m e t a l s , s e m i - p r e c i o u s s t o n e s ,
feathers and enamelling, to form neckpieces,
earrings and pins. Each piece seems to be
making a complex symbolic statement, as if,
given sufficient insight or ingeuity we'd be able
to decipher a message hidden behind the
simple beauty of the geometric sequence.
Amazingly, for modern jewellery, the pieces
are very wearable. Some of the larger, stiff,
necklaces would look best set against a very
s i m p l e d a r k d r e s s (as w o u l d an o r n a t e
necklace of any period) but others, and
certainly the pins and earrings, would be just
as happy with denims!
However, Miss Ramshaw is also concerned
that the pieces should be formally resolved
when not being w o r n and has, at times,
devised means by which they can be enjoyed
out of context of the wearer. For example, she
has made several totem pillars or columns of
turned beads in fine grained stoneware and
porcelain, in colours ranging from brilliant
blues and dull purples to pale greens, creams
and white. They are threaded on spikes and
rest on a brass disc: each column unscrews to
allow a random selection of beads to be strung
as a necklace on a nickel-silver neckwire.

Ramshaw's designs, in limited and unlimited
editions. The exhibition also includes other
work, from her ring sets of the late 1960s to
new ceramic pieces produced independently
of Wedgewood.
Also at the V & A at the moment, is an
exhibition of w a t e r c o l o u r s by J o h n Sell
Cotman, 1978-1842.
Until 1750, the watercolour was considered
a fairly minor art and was generally limited to
Gold neck wire with black ornaments
the tinted drawings of topographers, and the
'originals' used by engravers, coloured lightly
and soberly. The Romantic movement and the
perfection of the art of watercolour in this
country, coincided at the end of the 18th
Century, and made the English watercolour
school the most remarkable in the world.
L a n d s c a p e c o u l d express all R o m a n t i c
sensitivity, all spiritual moods: it was a limitless
realm of poetic freedom. A n d watercolour,
with its clean colour, it swiftness and lightness .
and its clear, almost transparent, lighting
effects, provided the landscape artist with a
way of expressing himself in a form that was
part realistic, part poetic.
J o h n S e l l C o t m a h ' s w a t e r c o l o u r s are
delightful. His drawing is superb and he steers
a course on the picturesque side of pretty. He
sometimes uses touches of pure colour to
powerful effect and the pictures are light and
soft, both in terms of photons-apparently-
emitted and in the delicacy of colouring and
design. Highly recommended to gentlefolk of
very civilised disposition!

Indian Cinema
T o most people Indian cinema means the
highly commercial, formulated, garish output
of the Bombay studios. Few are familiar with
or even aware of the subtle works of India's
world ranking directors. T o help change this,
India Society is running a short season of films
this term fea:uring great directors such as
Satyajit Ray, Minnal Sen and Shyan Benegal.
All films are subtitled in English and the season
starts on Tuesday in M e c h Eng 220 at 6:00pm
with Company Limited. For further informa-
tion please contact any member of the India
Society Committee, via the Union.
Company
Limited
Satyajit Ray, one of the world's foremost
directors is noted for his gentle observation of
human nature. In Company Limited he works
his magic again.
A n ambitious young Indian in a British
company in Calcutta wins the admiration of his
boss with a piece of business malpractice. But
he loses something more i m p o r t a n t — t h e
respect of his beautiful sister-in-law.
This charmingly told tale is a send-up of
India's m o c k w e s t e r n business c r u s a d e r s
unfolded in the best of cinematic traditions.
The British have long left India and the Raj
exists only as a memory. But the traditions,
the exclusive clubs and gymkhanas and public
schools have been left behind to provide a
somewhat ill-fitting and pretentious lifestyle for
t h e c o u n t r y ' s b r o w n s a h i b s . T h e r i c h
Industrialists.
S h y a m a l , the b r i g h t , p e r s o n a b l e a n d
smoothly Westernised young man is in the
running for a coveted seat on the board of the
British company he works for. He is stirred to
take stock of his life when his sister-in-law
comes to Calcutta from a provincial town for a
visit. She observes all the aspirations to a
Western style of culture with a mixture of
wonder and irony.
Ray's greatness lies in his treatment of the
subject in such a manner that the superficial
strangeness of the characters is soon lost and
one immediately recognises situations familiar
and known in human terms.
Sharmila Tagore gives an exquisite portrait
of the sister-in-law who combines, so rarely,
intelligence and humanity. Ray's heroines are
always so bright and deep.
