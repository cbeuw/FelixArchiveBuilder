thieves come in three categories:
the casual thief who will steal
any kind of machine for his o w n
use; the drug addict who takes
risks to steal anything that will
raise money; and, the profes-
sional gangs who are responsible
for a b o u t 8 0 % o f a l l thefts.
These p r o f e s s i o n a l s use b o l t -
cutters that they carry around i n
soft bags until they see a suitably
expensive bicycle. They then put
the bag on the ground next to
the chain and cut this through a
hole in the bag; this takes about
five seconds. Then they wheel
the bike away and load into a
nearby parked van. Generally

one area before moving on to

this.
