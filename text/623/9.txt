Book
The New and Noble School: The Pre-
Raphaelites by Quentin Bell, Macdonald
Â£10.95.
The Pre-Raphaelite movement started in
1848. It was a semi-secret society formed by
seven artists as a reaction against the artistic
doctrines that had prevailed from the time of
Raphael (early 16th Century) onwards. The
Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood (as they called
themselves) wanted to return to what they saw
as the m o r e n a t u r a l , h o n e s t a n d p i o u s
approach to the artists who worked before the
Renaissance. According to Ruskin, the Pre-
Raphaelites champion, art since the sixteenth
c e n t u r y had degenerated into 'indolence,
infidelity (because they didn't copy faithfully
from nature), sensuality and shallow pride'.
The Brotherhood set out to regenerate British
art (they adopted a high moral tone and largely
ignored foreigners) by painting historical and
other scenes as they actually might have
looked.
This is a very small scale summary of what
Quentin Bell's book is about. If you have any
interest in the subject then this is a good
book to buy (if. you can afford it) because it's
interestingly and informatively written, and
sometimes very entertaining. For example "...if
I you could go to Italy and see originals...you
j probably received an impression far deeper
and more valuable than that which the art
lover of today gains from the enormous mass
of m e n d a c i o u s r u b b i s h , p u r p o r t i n g to be
faithful reproductions of oil paintings by the old
masters, beneath which our coffee tables
groan." The book does get a little too profound
towards the end but on the whole it's very
g o o d to read. T h e r e are about sixty-six
pictures in it as well.

Cat People, Paul Schroder, X, now
showing at Plaza and ABC Fulham Rd.
Cat People is billed as a mixture of horror
and erotic fantasy. It fails as both.
T h e s t o r y begins w i t h v i r g i n a l Irena
(Natassia Kinski) visiting her long-lost brother
Paul (Malcolm McDowell). He immediately
attempts to rape her. Then he spins her a yarn
about how incest is good for them. It stops
them turning into man-eating big cats, he
assures her. Straight sex is a no-no.
Then Irena falls madly in love with the city,
zoo curator. Soon afterwards he suspects
Irena of actually being a panther and not a girl
at all. But he's determined not to let a thing like
that spoil an otherwise beautiful relationship.
The film has very little to recommend it. The
filming is dull and unimaginative (except for a
few bits k n o c k e d t o g e t h e r for p u b l i c i t y
purposes) and the screenplay crap (although
the score is pretty good). Even the special
effects, w h i c h u s u a l l y m a k e up for an
otherwise bad film are surprisingly ineffective
in Cat People.
However, I have a feeling that the film will be
as tremendously successful as Bo Derek's little
romps. Natassia Kinski is undeniably beautiful
and as she spends most of the film pouting
'innocent' sexuality it is sure to be appreciated
by those to whom a good film is synonymous
with one off the wrist.

Theatre
The Witch of Edmonton by Dekker, Ford
and Rowley, directed by Barry Kyle,
Royal Shakespeare Company at the Pit,
Barbican Centre.
The playwrights have combined their own
respective talents of melancholy, satire and
comedy to produce a delightful combination in
The Witch. Written in 1621, the play was one
of the few of that period which was concerned
primarily with the poor. Miriam Karlin plays
Mother Sawyer, a persecuted pauper who
experiences the spirit of the devil, appearing
b e f o r e her in the f o r m of a b l a c k dog
(portrayed by Miles Anderson). With the help
of the canine devil, Mother Sawyer seeks her
revenge on a community based on lust, money
and greed. Apparently the story is based on a
true one, of Elizabeth Sawyer from Islington
who was hanged for witchcraft in 1621.
The Pit is the Royal Shakespeare Company's
small a u d i t o r i u m at the B a r b i c a n C e n t r e ,
seating only 200 people. It continues the
tradition of the Other Place (at Stratford) and
the Warehouse which were rehearsal spaces
converted into intimate theatres. This intimacy
added to my enjoyment of the Barry Kyle
production since sitting on the front row I was
virtually on the edge of the stage, with props
and actors flying past my eyes. Indeed this was
a refreshing evening of theatre, a welcome
break from the West End sitcom.
However, due to the size of the Pit and the
popularity of The Witch, I strongly recommend
that ticket availability is checked before setting
off for the Barbican. Tickets, programmes and
drinks are inexpensive at the Pit and the play is
being presented on several dates between now
and early December.
