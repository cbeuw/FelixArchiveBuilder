IC 2nd XI vs
Charing Cross HMS 2nd XI
In the absence of skipper Furnish, spending a dirty weekend at the
seaside, it was left to the hapless, inexperienced 'Taffy' Salter to muster
the team. A protracted series of telephone calls eventually resulting in
10 men plus Mel Kinkie taking the field.
Salter won the toss and was conned into electing to bat by the bevy of
hockey players whose sole aim was to heckle at the Southgate vs
Hounslow hockey match. Such was Middleton's eagerness to leave the
cricket match that he tried the old trick of 'leaving the straight one', early
on. He was later described as the 'worst spectator at the hockey match.'.
Clothier then demonstrated the futility of the cross batted swipe and
soon returned to the bar.
Next to depart for the hockey
was Reilly, who after hacking a
stylish 9 gave the 'keeper some
catching practice. During all this
Hewkin has been playing shots
w h i c h n o b o d y k n e w h e
possessed, but when he realised
that he could not afford a jug for
his fifty, he threw away his wicket
having scored 32. Fenton soon fell
L B W and this brought the
experienced Acford to the wicket
to join his captain. Salter looked
hopelessly out of form and fell
victim to a spectacular slip catch
after scoring a streaky 14. The
sight of Acford at the wicket
s e e m e d to affect the c o -
ordination of the fielders who
dropped him several times and
twice gave him 4 overthrows.
Unfortunately Gattley fell victim
to some appalling umpiring (no
names,Clothier) and Roche, Elkin
and Jones could offer little
support and Acford was last out
for a very lucky 37.
The total of 112 seemed unlikely
to be enough on a good wicket,
but the capture of 2 wickets by
Fenton and a fine run-out by
Reilly sent Charing Cross into tea
with 5 for 3 on the board. A quick
b r e a k t h r o u g h after tea was
essential, and Acford provided
this. An over later Hewkin and
Roche made a bizzare sight as
they collided whilst both trying to
take a simple chance. The
repreived batsman took new life
and proceeded to edge and slash
his way to a decisive 59 n ,o., it was
perhaps apt that he was named
Chopin. Two untidy overs from
Middleton and some scrappy
fielding paved the way for a
Charing Cross victory, despite
late wickets from Reilly and
Gattley. Fenton bowled well to
take 2-24 in 10 overs.
Eventually Charing Cross won
by four wickets. The defeat was
doubly disappointing since there
was always a feeling that IC were
the better team and we were
unable to avenge the U L U cup
defeat of the 1st XI earlier in the
week.

IC IV Stride On
Imperial IV 2 v 1 Chelsea II
Imperial College IV extended
their unbeaten run with a hard
fought victory over a strong
Chelsea team at Harlington. Fresh
from a long Easter vacation
Imperial, very much the team in
form, had been looking forward to
this match for some time.
It turned out to be a typical
Harlington game with the wind
having as much influence on the
game as either of the two teams.
With the wind behind them in the
first half, Imperial had most of the
p o s s e s s i o n w h i c h p r o b a b l y
accounts for them only being one
goal up at half time. A cheeky
backheel by James Rowley
seperated the teams after 30
minutes, shortly after Millar and
Marten had both gone close.
The second half saw a spirited
r e c o v e r y by C h e l s e a a n d
inevitably after 20 minutes of
constant pressure the IC defence
cracked and it was 1-1 with
everything to play for. This goal
proved to be Chelsea's fatal
mistake because, although Cooke
and Millar were injured by this
stage, IC began to reassert
t h e m s e l v e s . W i t h e x c e l l e n t
goalkeeping from Veats and
sound defensive work from Phil
'You never mention me in the
reports' Lakin and Barry Hatton,
IC fought their way back into
contention. The vital goal arrived
courtesy of James Rowley whose
individual effort came with just
five minutes to go.
IC IV now have one match left
which they are confident of
winning as in the bar afterwards it
was discovered that Chelsea were
top of the league.
Team: Veats, Morris, Caffyn,
Hatton, Lakin (Captj, Marten,
Cook, Milar, Matthews, Rowley,
O'Kelly. Reporter: Glen Millar.
IC 2nd XI 127 All out
UC 2nd XI 110 for 4
Match Drawn
IC won the toss and were
soon 20 for 3. At this point
Maguire went out to join
opener Sims and tried to lose
his wicket also. His vain
attempts at this ceased when
he had made 8 and the
partnership moved the score
m o r e comfortably to 68. At
this point the thought of
Salter's u m p i r i n g and 3rd
rate h u m o u r forced Maguire
to unsubtly run himself out
by 5 yards. 2 more wickets
followed quickly to bring
Chadband, an aggressive
strokemaker, out to join
Price. C h a d b a n d made 5 out
of a partnership of 28.
Alter such dour batting carving
cavalier Care swore he would cut
loose but in fact made 7 out ofthe
next partnership of 25.
IC were all out for 127, the
respectability of the score being
due to the Sims-Maguire stand
and an aggressive 43 from Price.
U C lost 3 wickets quickly, for
27. and never really tried for
anything but the draw, despite
being given easy runs when Care
and Price, who bowl slow seam-
up half-volleys were brought into
the attack.
U C b e i n g not t e m p t e d ,
Imperial closed up the game by
bringing back the reliable Wyatt,
who took all 4 wickets, and
C h a d b a n d who was unlucky to be
played at and missed 3 or 4 times
in every over he bowled.
Pete Turner returned to f C
2nds after a 2 year lay off in
industry, and reminded us that he
is better at running out his own
side than he is at running out the
opposition.
Saturday sees Salter take over
captaincy for one game, from
brilliant astute tactician Furnish,
which could explain the exit of
half the side to the first X f and the
unavailability ofthe other half.
IC 3rd XI (Minus one)
RSM Only XI (Minus one)
Last Wednesay, two revision-ravaged teams of 'cricketers'
travelled to Harlington for their annual friendly. IC were
captained by Acford, who was obviously still recovering f r o m
the rigours of his tour to H o l l a n d with the cross-country club,
mere months earlier.
Mines, having allowed IC to field, made a shaky start, losing their
first wicket for only 104 runs (Button, 32), but Sangster hung on gamely
to make 82. Mines then recovered, next eight wickets putting on fifty-
nine runs. This was partly due to a series of three balls from
Coatesworth, which all took wickets (this cap -trick or something was
payed for with a jug of shandy after the match!). H e finally finished
with 5 wickets lor 6 runs.
W i t h Mines 163 all out,
H e w k i n and Acford survived a
ferocious over before tea, but on
their return, they had a slight
misunderstanding, resulting in
H e w k i n being run out for three.
Acford then made up for being
totally at fault by thrashing the
R S M bowling until, with his score
on zero, he was confused by a
straight long-hop on middle
stump.
T h e situation (11 for 2) was
slightly relieved by a good 28 from
Middleton, who fell to a rising
finger from the umpire. T h e later
resistance consisted mainly of a
career best 16 from Roche
(previous best 3) and a lighting
14 from Riley who. recruited from
the earlier hockey match, seemed
a little perplexed by his stick not
having a kink in it.
The match ended with a
dubious p l u m b L B W decision in
favour of Bark M u t t o n , who
finished with 4 wickets.
The teams then enjoyed a
ninety minute wait lor the coach
before invading the U n i o n .
