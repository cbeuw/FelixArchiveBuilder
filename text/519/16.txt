ICWA CALL FOR
BETTER SECURITY
Next year's I C Womens"
Association President is to be
Merche Clark. At the I C W A
annual general meeting on
Wednesday she received 17 votes
against 12 votes for her opponent,
R u t h Hildebrand.
M e r c h e C l a r k is a maths
student and has been very active
in W o m e n in Science and
Technology. She also led the
move at the last U n i o n meeting to
restore I C U ' s proabortion policy.
Prompted by discussions at the
University of L o n d o n U n i o n
Womens" Policy G r o u p I C W A
went on to discuss the problem ol
attacks on women on the College
campus.
Such attacks have recently
occurred at other L o n d o n colleges
and I C W A felt that security at IC
was inadequate especially in Beit
H a l l . Suggestions put forward
included rape alarms in H a l l
toilets and corridors and the
provision of door chains.
W o m e n also felt that there
should be more security guards,
and self defence classes were
considered useful.
T h e U L U Students' Repres-
entative Council will be writing to
L o r d A n n a n , the L o n d o n
University Vice Chancellor,
calling on the University to pay
more attention to protecting
people on its premises. T h e
Womens' Policy G r o u p is also to
draw up a letter to College
authorities asking for better
security.
CONFERENCE RECEIVES
GO AHEAD
T h e College have earmarked
£2000 from a Governors' fund to
help I C U n i o n organise the
international t e c h n o l o g y
student conference in two years'
time. I C U Council tentat'-
agreed to host the c o n f i r m ' it its
last meeting and look r neans
of financial support.
L O N D O N RAG
Deborah Perkin, the new
University ol London U n i o n V i c e
President in charge of services,
visited IC this week. H e r job is
sabbatical for the first time and
one of her main tasks will be to
promote U L U entertainments.
She does not want U L U to
compete with College entertain-
ments but would like to provide a
good alteranative with emphasis
on minority interests.
she also wants to see the U L U
building open on Sundays, and
will be setting up a working
party to consider organising a
joint U L U R a g Week'.
I C U officers J o h n Passmore
and Chris W e b b are cooperating
in the R a g proposal and have
asked any interested students to
contact them via the IC U n i o n
OITice.
PART TIMERS HIT
C o l l e g e G o v e r n o r s a r e
considering proposals to raise fees
for part time postgraduates by up
to 200%. IC U n i o n are alarmed at
this prospect a n d w i l l be
protesting agfainst the rise in
their lobby of the Governors this
morning.
There are 116 part time
postgraduates this session and
their fees are £136 per session for
advanced courses and £185 for
research.
T h e proposal is to make them
pay as much as full time students
for their course. A student taking
an M . S c . course part time over
two years would therefore pay
about £400 per session.
UNION LETTER
I C U n i o n is to send letters to all
students asked to withdraw from
College outlining the appeals
procedure and offering the
Union's help if students decide to
appeal.
College has agreed to let the
U n i o n Office have the list of
students asked to leave because ol
e x a m failures, a n d U n i o n
members have raised no objection
to c e r t a i n U n i o n O f f i c e r s
r e c e i v i n g t h i s c o n f i d e n t i a l
information.
STRIPPER OUT
T h e R C S Smoking Concert is
to become a quality review next
year following a unanimous
decision by the R o y a l College of
S c i e n c e U n i o n G e n e r a l
Committee. T h e change would
mean that there will be no
stripper on the bill.
T h e proposal, which was
supported by R C S U Prsident
Chris Fox, would keep the year
sketches but calls for a vast
improvement in their quality.
T h e Smoking Concert would
probably be renamed the R C S
Review.
Chris Fox denied that the
change had come about because
of protests by women against
sexism in the concert. H e said that
R C S U "does not par attention to
undemocratic minorities''.
In reaching its decision the
Committee had felt that Smoking
Concert in its present form
lowered the prestige of R C S
U n i o n . They wanted a review
which R C S members would be
proud of.
CHEAP BEANS
T h e U n i o n is to sell several 51b
tins of baked beans at 90p per tin.
T h e tins are unopened and were
left over from the last refectory
boycott.
