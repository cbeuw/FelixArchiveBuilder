IC U n i o n have again changed their m i n d on abortion and are
now supporting free abortion on demand.
In a remarkable about turn the Union's annual general
meeting reversed policy passed at the previous U n i o n meeting
and decided to support the 'Abortion Law R e f o r m
Association'.
Proposing the motion, Merche C l a r k said that each woman should
be able to make up her own m i n d on abortion. She called for an
increase in day care abortion facilities.
A n anti-abortion amendment proposed by Barry Austin called lot-
more help for women who have babies. T h e meeting accepted his
proposals but did not pass a section demanding full legal protection for
the unborn child.
Following heated discussion the meeting, which was better attended
than the previous meeting, passed the motion by a large majority, thus
taking IC U n i o n back to its earlier position of support for abortion. The
decision means that IC U n i o n will not have to press lor withdrawal
from the 'National Abortion C a m p a i g n ' by the University of L o n d o n
U n i o n .
The meeting was also the
o c c a s i o n to r t h e a n n u a l

TEN TORS SUCCESS
For the first time an RCS team of six men has succeded in completing
the Army's annual two-day Ten Tors expedition on Dartmoor. The
team was the only non-service team to complete the 55 mile route and
came in 4th out of 20 teams of which only 6 finished the course.
The team consisted of Chris Fox, Stuart Blackman, Mo Misra, Michael
Pantalouris, Dave Partridge and Neil Trask. A womens'team managed
to complete the shorter 35 mile course.
The men started off at 7.20 on Saturday morning and kept up a
relentless 3 mph pace until 10.10pm with only one 10 minute break.
Camping just below the sixth tor their night's rest was short and they
were on their way again at 5.10 on Sunday morning.
Though the course is 55 miles as the crow flies the actual distance
walked was nearer 70 miles. Many of these miles were ascents, about 25
miles were in Dartmoor's notorious peat bogs and much of the route
went through depressingly bleak country.
A map reading error by Chris Fox did not help matters by adding
another 2 miles and half an hour to the route.
Only one of the team, Neil Trask, was truly physically fit enough to
complete the course. For the rest it wasa question of "mind over matter"
in overcoming pain, blisters and tiredness.
Earlier the meeting ratified the
election of several people who had
been nominated unopposed.
These were Austin Reeve as
F E L f X Business Manager; Scott
