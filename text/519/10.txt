IC SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA
16th May, in the Great Hall
J. Haydn, Symphony No. 104, 'The London'
F. Liszt, Piano Concerto No. 1
G. Faure, Pavane.
R. Schumann, Symphony No. 4.
This was a very ambitious concert by the
S y m p h o n y Orchestra, with two symphonies and
i wo ot her pieces on t he programme. H a y d n ' s 104th
S v m p h o n y is in iact the last of his twelve
symphonies written lor a series oi concerts in
L o n d o n and therefore has no more right to its
nickname than those more usually known as 'The
Clock" or 'The Surprise". It received a competant
performance In the orchestra, who managed to
conyey both the beauty of the slow introduction
and of the second movement, and the excitement
and vivacity ol the last two movements,
The soloist in the Liszt E flat concerto was
Valerie Ash worth, presently in her fourth year at
the R C M . The demands ol this piece on the
strength and stamina of the soloist are
considerable, but despite this. Miss Ashworth gave -
a faultless and most enjoyable performance. T h e
orchestra had clearly worked hard at this item, and
one could easily forget that this was amateur
music-making; their spirited playing was as good as
a m of the many professional orchestras this
reviewer had heard play in this concerto.
The first item in the second half of the concert
was the Pavane by G a b r i e l F a m e , a short work
with one of those flowing themes which run back
into themselves like a perpetual motion machine.
This was followed by Schumann's 4th symphony, a
piece which is shorter, lighter and more
contrapuntal than many other symphonies of
comparable vintage. This involved a considerable
solo part for violin, which was a d m i r a b l y executed
by D a v i d Bogle. The orchestra played well
throughout, with crisp confident entries into the
canonical coda at the end, tor example.
O n e -mall grumble: could we have legible
programme-, lor the next concert, please.J

IMPERIAL C O L L E G E C H O I R ,
Conductor, E Brown.
18th May, in the Great Hall.
J.S. Bach, Cantata No. 21.
E.J. Moeran, Nocturne.
J. Berger, Brazilian Psalm.
G. Bizet, Te Deum.
T o say that Johann Sebastian Bach
was one of the 'greatest' composers of
Western music is to say nothing new.
But for many years after the composers
death, his music was neglected because
it was thought to be stuffy and
academic. Eventually it was revived, by
Mendelssohn in Germany, by Wesley in
this country and by Shostakovich in the
Soviet Union. M u s i c can only be fully
appreciated by the ear and not by the
eye; once the scores are performed, the
public can begin to f o r m opinions.
Today most people are aware of Bach's
music, and know that it appeals to more than
the intellect ; and could p. obably whistle
'Sheep may safely gra*. j r 'Jesu, joy of
M a n ' s desiring', at tlv .-rop of a hat. Both of
these well known • <'s come from Bach's
numerous cantata.'., and one such was the
opening work in last Friday's C h o i r concert.
This was No. 21 of the C h u r c h contatas, ' M y
heart was greatly troubled', in which the Soul
goes from despair to joy via a central duet in
which the Soul (soprano) is conforted by
Christ (bass).
fC C h o i r seemed to be greatly troubled by
the first two choruses, but picked up
confidence towards the end of the cantata.
T h e orchestral accompaniment includes a
rather demanding 'cello part, especially in
the second of the tenor arias. Unfortunately
the cellist. Peter Beavan, and harpsichordist,
Christopher Shaw, did not quite agree on the
tempo of this passage. The three vocal solists
gave an enjoyable rendering of their
respectively allotted notes. A l l three were to
reappear later in the programme.
After the interval, the C h o i r continued
with two twentieth century pieces. The first
of these was a Nocturne by E J M o e r a n , a
piece very similar in style and atmosphere to
'Sea Drift' by Delius, but on a much smaller
scale. The musical form of the nocturne was
of course set by another composer of Irish
extraction, the pianist J o h n Field.E.J.'s piece
is about evening rather than night, since the
text is an 'address to the sunset'. As befits
nocturnal music, the voices are accompanied
mostly by muted strings, with sparing use of
the wind instruments. The atmosphere of a
peaceful summer evening was captured
rather well by the C h o i r and the baritone
soloist, Clive Harre. It is a piece which I shall
look forward to hearing again one day:
unfortunately, Moeran's music, like that of
many British composers active immediately
before the last war, is rather neglected in
concerts today.
The second and more adventurous of the
'modern' pieces was an addition to the
advertised programme. This was the
'Brazilian Psalm' by Jean Berger, for
unaccompanied choir. This sounded quite
difficult, but the C h o i r seemed to enjoy
singing it and handled the dynamics very
w e l l . U n f o r t u n a t e l y the w o r d s , a
supplemented version of one of the psalms,
were not always clear.
The last work to be performed was Bizet's
'Te D e u m ' , with Diane Mansfield and Jeffrey
Cresswell as soloists. As the principal text of
rejoicing and praise in the liturg y of the
major Christian Churches, the Te D e u m has
been set to music by a great many composers,
and Bizet's setting is a particularly exuberant
one. The heavy vamping accompaniment in
the opening and final passages is perhaps a
little uninspired, but the tunes are lively and
so was this performance. Diane Mansfield
sung beautifully in the soprano solo, 'Te
ergo'. Professor Brown took the piece at a
fairly brisk pace which left the listener with
an impression of energetic rejoicing, and the
Choir, despite being fewer in numbers than
usual, came across clearly even in the loudest
orchestral passages.
