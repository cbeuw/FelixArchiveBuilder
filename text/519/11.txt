'Nosferatu T ^ Vampyre' (AA Werner
Herzog)
Few films nave ever raised the mixed
feelings that this 'remake' of the 1922 silent
classic'Nosferatu' has in me. I was fascinated
from the beginning by the idea of one of
E u r o p e ' s most promising directors
combining once more with the talent of the
often tempremental actor Klaus Kinski. On
viewing the result I was thrown back to my
childhood - old fears and fantasies re-
emerged.
The story sticks closely to the ideas of the
original novel. The evil Count is portrayed as
a sad, infinitely lonely creature who seems to
be fighting for release. Truth and faith are
seen to be ignored in favour of scientific
principle, but in the end they prevail. The
product of fear and fantasy is a strange
fascination for this almost too real being. His
every appearance drew my undivided
attention.
Johanatan Harker is sent to Transylvannia
to sell a house in his picturesque home town
to Count Dracula. He encounters a fanged,
white faced creature with cauliflower ears
who holds him forceably in his casjle. O n
seeing a picture of Lucy, Johnathan's wife he
mutters the laughable line, 'Oh what a lovely
neck!' He then sets sail for Delft (such a
beautiful location) with Lucy's jugular in
mind. The ensuing tale is familiar but filmed
in such a way as to be new and refreshing.
The scenes alternate between the silence
of darkness and the silence of the plague
stricken town, each being a collection of
serene, ghostly images crammed with soft,
melancholy colours. The result is beautiful
and horrific, but I can't explain why. In fact
much of the film defies description - is it a
tribute to the effective use of visual imagery in
silent films or a demonstration of clever
camera work? Either way it is very enjoyable,
even with subtitles. Also of great note are the
performances of Kinski (as Dracula) and
Isabelle Adjani as Lucy. They blend in the
final scene to produce a conflict of sexual
desire and physical repulsion. I applaud the
absence of blood dripping from the
vampire's fangs at every opportunity.

IFILM
I would recommend this film to anybody
who likes to dwell for more than an hour or so
on a story. For a less demanding night out
wait for the other dracula reworks currently in
the pipeline - most of which will inevitably use
a tall, handsome lover for the Count role. Well
you can keep them as far as I'm concerned. -
Klaus Kinski has proved he is worth a dozen
Christopher Lees. I also think that buckets of
blood should be saved for incoming R C S U
execs!
P.S. Don't forget that if you have any opinions
on films, reviews and their development or
anything else, you can contact mevia Physics

'Nosferatu The Vampyre' is showing at the
Gate, Notting Hill.

Singles Review:

Totally unbiased single of
the week; ' A H the boys love
Carrie' by Another Pretty
F a c e . T o t a l l y u n b i a s e d
despite the fact that the
manager is a Friend of a
Friend. H o w do I manage to
stay so completely impartial
when the group and I have an
almost intimate relation-
ship? Firstly one has to be ofa
neutral disposition, and then
one has to pretend that one
does not know anything about
them, then one writes an
absolutely ecstatic review
without even mentioning the
music. For example ... Wow

essential) w h a t a G r e a t
Record! What a bash, what a

Oldest single ol the week;
'Frederick' Patti Smith G r o u p .
T w o weeks old and still sounds as
good and fresh as the day it was
released, Patti sure knows how to
write songs of lasting quality. O f
