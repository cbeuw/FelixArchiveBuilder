CONSERVATIVE SOCIETY - European Elections
In the forthcoming election 1 would appreciate it greatly if
you all voted Conservative ... No this is not a pre-General
Election article which was somehow rediscovered after lying
for weeks amongst the piles of rubbish on the floor of the
E E L I X office; I a m referring to the forgotten (at least in
Britain) elections for the European Assembly.
Consoc scored a first in college by being the first political society to
invite a candidate namely Sir D a v i d Nicolson who is standing for one of
the 81 giant British constituencies L o n d o n Central, which contains 10
Westminster parliamentary seats. This election is a unique occurrence
since it is the World's first simultaneous international elections and will
result in Europe's first democratically elected parliament.
Speaking on Tuesday. M a y 8th to a vast audience of at least 10
people Sir D a v i d proceeded to explain why Europe and in particular,
Britain needs a strong European Economic C o m m u n i t y run by a
democratically elected European Parliament.
Membership of the E E C does becomes a strong and coherent
not mean a free meal ticket, but it
does present opportunities for
Britain to take advantage oi.
Although it is clear there is a
r e q u i r e m e n t to reform the
C o m m o n Agricultural Policy, its
inherent advantages namely the
prospects of C o m m u n i t y self-
sufficiency in food at a time ol
increasing W o r l d populations,
must not be overlooked. The
reason for food surplusses, which
have given rise to the notorious
mountains and lakes has been the
greatly increased production ol
food by the C o m m u n i t y over the
last decade or so.
It is essential that Europe
defence bloc not only able to
supplement the defence umbrella
provided by the U S A , but
eventually to possess its own
defence n e t w o r k a n d t h ' .
dispensing with reliability o • lie
U S defences which would '..tve to
provide protection ir. • finitely,
which is a dangerous position to
be in. Nuclear deterrents only
work if there is M u t u a l l y Assured
D e s t r u c t i o n , M A D , w h i c h
because there is now no strict
parity between U S A and U S S R is
no longer true. U n t i l both sides
learn how to participate in
bilateral disarmaments there is an
urgent need lor the West, which
includes Europe, a party which
matches both 'Superpowers' in
wealth and populations, to
maintain the balance of weapons.
For increased wealth, Britain
must increase her share of the
export market; a 1% increase
represents 400,000 new jobs. By
far the greatest prospects of
a c h i e v i n g this lie i n the
exploitation of the vast market
furnished by the E E C E u r o p e also
provides the opportunity for
London, capital of Britain, to
become the chief economic
capital of the C o m m u n i t y since
Britain has large assets such as the
C o m m u n i t y ' s l a r g e s t c o a l
reserves, N o r t h Sea oil and
expertise in many fields. Britain
c a n a l s o l e a r n f r o m her
C o m m u n i t y partners in her
weaker areas such as labour law,
lor example.
A more specific area where
C o m m u n i t y funds could be
utilised is the channel tunnel
which if in the form of a road
and double rail tunnel could
relieve greatly the congestion at
Heathrow. Since neither Britain
nor FYance are exactly eager to
loot the bill alone, money
supplied by the rest of the
C o m m u n i t y could be used to
finance this and other major
projects affecting specific areas
within the E E C .
So on Thursday, J u n e 7th you
have the opportunity to vote and
you have the choice between
s e n d i n g E u r o p e a n ministers
which will try to get a 'lair deaf
for Britain - whatever that means
and those which will endeavour to
positively help Europe to the
benefit of Britain and the
C o m m u n i t y as a whole. Thus it is
essential that you vote for the
party which took Britain into
Europe, which is the Conserva-
tive Party.
People are required for helping
to leaflet the L o n d o n Central
constituency - which is a
marginal. The College halls of
residence may require hand
leafleting if it is decided that the
f o r c e s w h i c h c a u s e d the
disappearence of the General
Election leaflets are still present.
So if you want to help, then
contact our chairman, Stephen
Poley, C C D 3 or any other
member of Consoc you think may
be able to give you relevent
information.
O h by the way I have great
pleasure in announcing the
Schlomo Godsi has filled the
vacant place of Publicity Officer.

Kings Team
IC 1st VI v Kings 1st VI
The now very cosmopolitan tennis team set out in a Marina and a
transit van to Hartington to battle against a reputedly strong Kings side.
With a supporters'squad of 8, the team was very anxious to keep the
unbeaten record ahcieved so farthis season. Upon arrving at Harlington
we were confronted with a roudy group with names such as llle
someone, Jimmy-boy and B B , the latter being a tall Scandanavian. We
naturally complained about this unlikely squad but were shown rather
dubious union cards, these being bits of paper with their names
scribbed on in green crayon and Kings College, Lodnon written above.
Not particularly daunted, butfar the club house eating our tea, we
from undaunted, the Imperial
side set about Kings like lions, sea
lions. The inevitable soon looked
inevitable with Imperial losing a
service game with four double
faults; obviously nerves were
playing a large part in the match.
Luckily good serving from our
opponents was noticibly absent
and we stormed to a 3-0 lead after
the first round. This was met with
total silence from the Kings side
as they o b v i o u s l y resolved
themselves to a hard fight as the
match progressed.
It was only after the second
round when we found ourselves in
an unbeatable position that we
realised our mistake. As we sat in
realised what had happened.
Kings had not even sent a team,
the match was cancelled and we
had not been playing against
anyone at all.
Imagine our horror with all this
tea and orange juice going to
waste. Very luckily the generous
supporters came to our rescue
and made short work of the food
and especially the orange juice.'
Thirsty work being a supporter:
strange how they didn't realise
Kings weren't here either.
Final Result
IC 6 Kings 0
Match stopped because Kings
didn't turn up.
IC 1st VI v Bush Hill 1st VI
Under 21 Middlesex knock-out
Imperial College entered this competition for the first time this year
and were hoping to do well. We were in good spirits as we set off on a
sunny Friday evening and felt quietly confident.
The four team members left in Tony's Marina towards North London.
Luckily Tony knew the area and we zoomed up and down the back
streets like Starsky and Hutch. We finally got there after being given
three different sets of directions. Bush Hill Park L T C is situated in the
Middle class commuter belt of North London where no-one knows
where anywhere is!
Upon arriving we were whisked
off to the local park to play on
some very slow courts which
suited some of us, namely the less
talented. We were greeted by a
smiling toothless fellow who told
me about his trip to the ladies on a
cleaning errand only to be
slapped round the face by a self-
conscious old woman.
Well now to the match. Our
opponents were on the young
side with little match experience.
After a long wait for their fourth
member, who had missed his bus,
the match began. The 1st round
was soon over with a loss of only 5
games by the IC team. The second
round progressed much the same
way for Tony and Dave losing
only 2 games before taking the
match and hence winning the
whole round. In the other match
Barry and I were rather more
generous. After losing the first
game we took the set 6-1. In the
second set some atrocious play
by both of us enabled the Bush
Hill pair to win the set 7-5. One set
all, very close, both sides going
for the win. Unfortunately for
them we were going for it a bit
harder, winning the final set 6-0
with the loss of only 6 points.
We returned to the club house
for fried eggs, sausages, beans
etc. and several pints of Abbot. We
a l s o d i s c o v e r e d t w o f r u i t
machines with jack pots of £50
and £100. I decided not to win it
because I thought we might
become a bit unpopular.
Final Result
IC 4 Bush Hill 0
Tony Tsoukas 6-2, 6-0, 1st pair
Dave Cornwall 6-2, 6-0 2nd pair
Barry Witts 6-1, 5-7, 6-0 1st pair
