Lobby
10:00am on today
conldfrom Page 2
The womens' rights lobby
believes in the woman's right to
choose what becomes of her body.
It is m y contention that a woman
has every right to do as she will
with her o w n body. Thus it is her
right to have sexual intercourse as
she pleases within the restrictions
of the moral code to which she
subscribes.This act involves the
close c o - o p e r a t i o n of h e r
husband, w h o equally has every
right to choose what becomes of
his body. • Today a number of
methods of preventing conception
exist, of which at least one is
acceptable to the vast majority of
people in the Western World.
Therefore in the overwhelming
majority of cases, conception
occurs either by choice, or
through negliegence. Once a
child has been conceived it has a
seperate, though very dependant
existence; it is itself an individual
with rights.
H a v i n g chosen to conceive a
child, the woman's right does not
extend to destroying that child
simply because it is inconvenient.
This surely is the ultimate i n
imposing beliefs - killing someone
who does not fit in with your own
plans. I would like to point out
that it is not purely a woman's
problem. T h e father has an equal
responsibility for the child, and in
its future.
In conclusion I submit that it is
not a contradiction for a Womens1
Rights campaigner to support a
movement opposed to abortion
on demand, in fact if she believes
in rights for anyone at all, then it
is her duty to give such a group
her full co-operation.
Yours sincerely,

CYCLE OWNERS
To those of y o u who bring
cycles to the College, please
make sure y o u use very stout
chains together with equally
strong locks. Far too many plastic
covered steel cables and weak
locks are still being used.
Thefts of cycles from the
College is again o n the increase.
To date 24 have been stolen this
year, 5 within the last few years.
M o s t c y c l e s have F r a m e
Numbers and I do ask all owners
to search for this number a n d
personally record it. Should they
have the misfortune to report the
theft, the frame number does
assist the Police in their enquiries.
Do try a n d get your cycle
insured for theft etc.
