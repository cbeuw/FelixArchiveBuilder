Keymer Does It Again, And Again (Boring) R-JlH'ir'flc & S t l O o l c P t *
A fortnight ago Geoff Keymer won the U L U Championship. Last
week, he also won the IC open, and IC billiards competitions, and on
successive days, what's more.
This season's competitions have been dominated by Maths and
Physics students:
Freshers Tournament: S Jeans (Physics 1) defeated P Peters (Maths 1)
3-1.
Tournament: G Keymer, S Teelock (Maths 2) defeated O Avni, A Gott
(Physics 3), 4-3.
U L U Championship: was won by G Keymer (Maths 2).
IC Open: G Keymer (Maths 2) defeated P Peters (Maths 1) 4-1.
Billiards Tournament: G Keymer, defeated D Thomas (Physics 1) in the
handicap S Teelock (Maths 2) will play either A Ball or A Gott in the
final. (I beat Geoff in the semi-final, yeah!).
I would like to thank all those club members who took the trouble to
take part in these competitions.
A s well as the contests, G Keymer won 2 snooker ladders, and M
Cherry and A Cameron tied in the billiards ladder.
Club Matters: Here are some of the things you lucky people can look
forward to next year.
1. We will be getting new cues very soon.
2. I have unearthed a copy of the club constitution and will be updating
It during the summer (it is dated 1971). A copy will be on disp • i the
snooker lounge at all times next year.
3. We hope to be able to provide light refreshments (i.e. beer) at our
general meetings in the future. All committee meetings in future will be
open to ordinary members.
4. We hope to have some snooker club bar nights next year.
5. We will be having team trials early in the first term. Any student is
welcome to try for a team place.
6. We will be having lots and lots of competitions next year, so I hope
you will enter them. Also the snooker ladder will be handicapped next
year (sorry Geoff).
7. There will be regular match reports next year, and I hopethat we will
get some supporters, to come along to matches.
All this and more will happen next year in IC Billiards and Snooker
club, the no. 1 recreational club in College.
Till then, if you have any bright ideas on how to improve the club, why
not come to the open committee meeting on Wednesday June 13th at
1pm in the Snooker lounge or alternatively, come and see me some
time.

P.S. I would like to thank 4 great people who have made this year in the
Snooker club an extremely enjoyable one for me. Mark Cherry, Geoff
Keymer, Mick Maghar, and Chris Rose. Thanks guys.
DEBSOC - A b o r t i o n Debate
Following our success last
t e r m o f actually having a n
outside speaker, we have
achieved this t e r m something
even m o r e tremendous - 2
outside speakers (at the same
debate!) C o u l d this be the end
of t h e O e b s o c b o o k o f
refusals ?
Even the lovely weather
outside and a free p e r f o r m -
ance of the 1812 did not deter
people f r o m c o m i n g to hear 2
well k n o w n figures i n the
abortion w o r l d debate on
Tuesday 15th M a y .
W i t h Barry W a r i n g in the
Chair. Sharon Spiers (Abortion
Law R e i b r m Association opened
the debate b y proposing the
motion 'This house believes that
free abortion should be available
on request'. The main theme of
her speech was that the choice was
not between abortion or no
abortion , but between legal
abortion or illegal abortion.
Sharon pointed out that since the
last abortion act (1967) the
numbers ol deaths of the mother,
due, directly or indirectly, to
abortion h a d fallen drastically
and that over one million women
had had an abortion since the act.
Phyllis Bowman (Society for
the P r o t e c t i o n o f u n b o r n
children) replied with an equally
stirring speech in which she
pursued the theme that human
life begins al conception and that
there is no difference between
abortion and infanticide. She also
disagreed with most of Sharon's
statistical back-ups even when
they apparently came from the
same source (the House of
Commons).
Apparently it is now tradition
lor Spiers and Bowman to do
battle together at student union
debates and as such this proved
itsell to be one of our most exciting
to dale.
Alter a question and answer
session a vote was taken and the
motion was defeated by a margin
ol only one vote.
