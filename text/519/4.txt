hope) to say about myself, and a
little bit about what goes on

anybody doesn't already know. It
only takes about live minutes to

M y name is Heather MeC'ione.
and I a m the new Secretary lot IF
Students" U n i o n . M y job as
secretary includes such things as
typing letters to various people
and ordering stationery for the
students. I then have the task of
trying to persuade them to buy all
their paper, pens. etc. from the
L nion. I also seem to have some ol
the more menial jobs which no-
one else will do. like tidying up all
the mess in the U n i o n .
As m y name might suggest. I
a m Scottish but dcfinately not

Dunfermline in Fife. The fact that
I live so far away means that I a m
very rarely there. I can't afford to
go home very often with no grant!
Contrary to popular belief,
people in Scotland are not
barbarians who wear kilts and eat
haggis all the time!
Date of Birth: 10/3/61 (That

I hope that the new IF Exec,
will be able to encourage next
year's freshers, and also those only
doing the one-year course to get
more involved in the social
activities around college, and to
try and get rid of the general air
of apathy aroud IF. Alter all. most
people go to college to enjoy
themselves and have some Inn,
not to work, or do llicv.'

MARANATHA
'He who believes In me will live, even though he die'.
Now a man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village
of Mary and her sister Martha. So the sisters sent word to Jesus, 'Lord,
the one you love Is sick.'
On his arrival, Jesus found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb
for four days. When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out
to meet him, but Mary stayed at home. 'Lord,' Martha said to Jesus, 'If
you had been here, my brother would not have died. But I know that
even now God will give you whatever you ask.' Jesus siad to her, 'your
brother will rise again. 'Martha answered, 'I know he will rise again in the
resurrection at the last day.' Jesus said to her, 7 am the resurrection and
the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies; and
whoever lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe this?'
'Yes, Lord,' she told him, 7 believe that you are the Christ, the Son of
God, who was to come into the world.'
When Mary reached the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell
at his feet and said, 'Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not
have died.'
When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along
with her also weeping, he was deeply moved and troubled. 'Where have
you laid him?'be asked. 'Come and see, Lord,' they replied. Jesus wept.
Then the Jews said, 'See how he loved him!' But some of them said.
'Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man
from dying?'
Jesus, once more deeply moved, came to the tomb: a cave with a
stone laid across the entrance. Take away the stone,' he said. 'But,
Lord,' said Martha, the sister of the dead man, 'by this time there is a bad
odour, for he has been there lour days.' Then Jesus said, 'Did I not tell
you that if you believed, you would see the glory of God?' S o they took
away the stone. Then Jesus looked up and said, 'Father, I thank you that
you have heard me. I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the
benefit of the people standing here, that they may believe that you sent
me.' When he had said this, Jesus called in a loud voice, 'Lazarus come
out!' The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped with strips of
linen, and a cloth around his face. Jesus said to them, 'Takeoff the grave
clothes and let him go.'
