LEAVING COLLEGE THIS YEAR?
Fill in an 'account transfer' form now.
We'll have your Barclays account waiting at any branch
you choose on the date you choose.
The last thing you want when you
graduate is all the fuss of transferring your
bank account.
So, if you bank at Barclays, all you need
do is fill in the form below and bring it with
you next time you call at your branch.
This will ensure that when you leave
college your account will be transferred to
whichever Barclays branch you choose.
Finally, if you have any problems about
your finances, or are not sure of the location
of the nearest Barclays to your new address,
don't forget your Student Business Officer
will be happy to help.
