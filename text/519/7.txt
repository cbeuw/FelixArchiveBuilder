MARY MUTTERS- mostly about Sweden
For those of you who've been terrifically distraught about my absence from the pages of FELIX, I can only offer my sincere
apologies and offer the excuse that I went to Sweden for one week and have since been spending my time moving flats, (my new
address is Flat 5, 18 Longridge Road, and you are welcome to drop in for a cup of coffee).
Visit to Chalmers University
I visited C h a l m e r s University of Technology, Gothenburg, Sweden, f r o m A p r i l 26th to M a y 2nd for the 75th anniversary of the
C h a l m e r s Student Union. C h a l m e r s has an arrangement with Imperial whereby students can choose to spend their fourth year
studying here (on M S c courses). We have presently got about 17 such students.
Other than to better student relations between C h a l m e r s and Imperial the trip was also inspired by the great level of
democracy, with considerable representation for students, staff and representatives of industry that exists by law in all colleges
of higher education within Sweden.

A number of the clebrations were annual spring events enlarged lor
the celebrations: others were specially arranged.
The first event was a cocktail party lor friends of the union. M a n y
other technical institutes brought crazy presents but the most amazing
was the end of a pipeline presented by Pripps, the local brewery,
(apparently the Student U n i o n has shares in Pripps and every year at
the shareholders meeting the U n i o n has spoken for the construction ofa
pipeline to Chalmers).
T h e second event I attended was the showing of the annual Spex, a
musical play written and produced by members of Chalmers since
1938. This year's was called Nero. The essential thing about Spex is that
they include various drinking songs which are then added to the
vocabulary of snapps and punch songs sung while drinking during
meals. The Spex are recorded each year and the company tour the
country for a couple of weks. They are very professionally produced.
I then went to the Jubilee S p r i n g Ball attended by representatives of
the local town council as well as past and present rectors and other local
figures. W e sang lots of songs and I learnt the rules of how and when to
toast people. O n Saturday (28th) the town concert hall was taken over
for a jubilee concert. Lots of Chalmers students performed, singing,
playing and dancing with some invited groups from other technical
universities and from the locality. O n Sunday they took over Liseberg
(a sort of Battersea funfair) and there were fireworks at the end. O n
M o n d a y there was the annual 'rag' procession, (only it doesn't raise
money for charity), where lots of very impressive floats depicting
various satirical scenes about political and social issues were watched by
an estimated 100,000 members ofthe Gothenburg public (despite the
rain). This annual even takes place during the Spring festival which is
always on 30th A p r i l , (even if it's snowing, which it did at times). O n
Tuesday, lst, and Wednesday, 2nd, f had nothing much to do but try
and find out about the University and the U n i o n .
I had a long discussion with the Rector of Chalmers and discussions
with the six sabbatical officers (Chalmers is about the same size as
Imperial), some students from the Engineering Physics department and
the C h a i r m a n of the Postgraduate Board.

There are a great many laws that are made relating to the
administration of Universities and education generally. The
Universities are financed by the University Chancellor's olfice. This
now deals with all areas of higher education as a recent restructuring ol
education linked every institute of higher education with some
institution that does some research and they are therefore all now called
a university. For instance, because of this, Chalmers has gained a naval
college which is now part of the University's technology. The
Government appoints professors, although associated professors are
appointed by the institution. The structures and the democracy within
university institutions is also laid down by Government. One of the
most interesting procedures is the requirement by law on the Principal
of any institution to appoint an advisor for any majorpolicy decision to
be taken. T h e advisor can be anyone in the employ of the state who will
then conduct an investigation and recommend a decision. The
University Board is not bound by the decision of the advisor but their
disagreement must be recorded.
T H E U N I V E R S I T Y C O M M I T T E E S
The University Board (Governing Body) has representatives of
industry, teachers and students.
The Education Board which takes overall decisions on educational
goals of the university is similarly composed.
Each Department has a school committee which looks after the
teaching provision. These consist of 12 people, one third students, one
third academic stall', and one third representatives of professions and
industry.
T h e research students play a similarly important role in faculty
committees, with about 20% student representation.
T H E U N I V E R S I T Y
There are about 4,500 students at Chalmers, most of whom are on
their four year undergraduate courses to Masters degree. There are
about 500 research students. The University is organised into 6 schools,
Engineering Physics, Mechanical Engineering, and Architecture. T h e
total budget of the University is 250 million kroner (£\ = 9 kroner).
About a 125 million of this goes on research, of which 55 million is in
research contracts. Undergraduates can, and generally do, take longer
than the lour years to complete their course. Courses are organised in 8
week blocks, 7 weeks studying and 1 week of exams. This happens four
times a year, so there is no 'sudden death' period during the summer as
we have in Britain. Three courses are taken in any 8 week block and 45 -
48 passes are needed to get a degree. Some courses can be taken from
Gothenburg University in the Arts and Pure Sciences. A school at
Chalmers may buy a course from another school, eg in particular,
Maths. I chatted to some students from the School of Engineering
Physics about their courses. Their U n i o n Committee has been
discussing extending their courses to training and communications,
public speaking, etc. and in English. Presently they have three years of
compulsory courses, a small amount of choice in the third year and no
compulsory courses in the fourth year.

T h e . U n i o n structure is quite complicated and there are many
interesting differences with our U n i o n (and similarities). There are no
U n i o n General Meetings although School Committees are elected by
General Meetings. T h e U n i o n Council of 35 is elected by college-wide
ballot, with a strange electoral system which seems to give an
unreasonable bias to student 'parties'. T h e C o u n c i l elects the 6
sabbaticals which make up the Board ofthe U n i o n . The Board sets up
millions of sub-committees.
Postgraduates have a Board of their own, and two to three General
meetings per year.
T h e U n i o n sometimes has referenda, for instance, a recent referenda
decided to put the prices up in their refectory, (which is run by the
Union), by one kroner, and simultaneously to improve the quality and
add a salad serving.
Chalmers U n i o n is a member of their National U n i o n , which has as a
part of it a National U n i o n ofTechnical Students. T h e National U n i o n
of Technical Students has recently been running a long discussion
programme about the future of technical education. A part of this
discussion was the amount of practical training that should be part of a
degree, (at present you have to do relevant work for at least four
months).
Gothenburg Student U n i o n , the area organisation ol students, deals
with Welfare issues, none of which are dealt with in anv way by the
University institutions themselves. It is the Student L'nion which is also
involved in housing. The Student H a l l is run by the Town C o u n c i l with
representation by the U n i o n and no involvement whatsoever from the
University.
A n interesting difference in the U n i o n is thai the clubs that exist
receive no recurrent grant from the L'nion and have to be self-
financing, although they may put in an application for provision of
equipment.
The U n i o n is financed by a compulsory donation from all of the
students in the University. There was a recent major .debate in
Parliament about whether student union membership should be
compulsory and it was decided that it should remain so. There are no
tuition fees charged to students so the U n i o n fee of about £i0 is only
expenditure in order to study.
I apologise for the disorganised way in which I have presented this
material, but if you want to find out more about Chalmers, then you
can always try and dig out one of'the students over here on exchange, or
come and have a chat with me. It was a very worthwhile visit and I hope
we will continue close relationships with the Students U n i o n there.
