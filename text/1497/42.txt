Afternoon, all. How’s your Friday go-
ing? I’ll be honest with you, at the time
you’re reading this you can probably
find me enjoying a well-deserved pint at
the union, It’s all been a bit panicky for
us sports editors this week, mainly due
to the fact that the sports fixtures only
started this Wednesday and that we had
absolutely nothing to put into our be-
loved dark-green-themed section.
Having spent far too long deciphering
the new-format BUCS website, we are
proud to bring back the Fixtures and Re-
sults list, which (despite its name) only
contains fixtures this week. Never fear,
you’ll be able to find out how all of Im-
perial’s sporting clubs get on from next
week onwards, which will also mark
the beginning of this year’s Felix Sport
league table. The concept is simple:
we tally the wins, losses and draws of
all the sports clubs and see who is the
most successful - this should really be
your only point of reference for drunken
bragging -and banter - at the union on a
Wednesday night.
Other than that, the opposite page sees
the introduction of our Club Captain in-
terview series. We plan to do one every
two weeks, so if you want to show the
whole university the faces behind your
club’s teams, get in touch with us at
the usual address: sport.felix@impe-
rial.ac.uk. This is actually a good place
for me to remind you guys (as I will do
all year) that WE NEED YOU lovely
sporty people to send us your reports in,
otherwise we have nothing to print! It’s
a win-win situation: you get to see your
heroic exploits in the paper on Friday,
and we don’t have a panic attack when
the Sport inbox is empty on a Thursday
morning.
All that’s left to me is to wish you luck
for the rest of the year. That, and savour
the English defeat last weekend in the
Rugby World Cup. Being French has its
perks sometimes - commiserations, guys.
