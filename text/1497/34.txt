Who is going to be the next Imperial MasterChef?
Imperial Food Awards
Felix Food introduces a new column: the “Food
Battle”! Two beloved dishes are “stripped down”
until we find which is the healthiest for you.
One of the guiltiest pleasures around is fast
food. Although many people have decided to put
an embargo on it, some of us just can’t live with-
out it. What we can do is make smart choices,
which are healthier without depriving us of junk
food’s delightful taste!
This issue’s contestants: the chicken nuggets
and the chicken fillet burger. Who will be the win-
ner?

Imperial Food Awards are brought to you by Felix Food and our generous sponsors:
Wafflemeister is preparing for the waffliest
competition ever! Eat your way through the
full range of Wafflemeister favourites and an
unlimited supply of classic waffles in 3 min-
utes! Only rule: no drinking of any kind al-
lowed.
Whoever eats the most waffles wins. Register

What you are going to need:
• 35 ml Tequila
• 20 ml Triple Sec
• 15 ml strawberry juice (or any other juice
you prefer)
• Ice cubes
Margarita is the most common tequila-based
cocktail and was most probably invented in
Mexico, although there is no solid proof of
its origin. We like it in its classic form or with
strawberry, pineapple, peach, mango or papaya
flavours.
You can enjoy your favourite margarita with
a Mexican meal or as a dessert on its own and
the good news is that it is very easy to make it
at home.
To make one put everything in the blender un-
til the texture of your cocktail becomes creamy.
Rub the rim of the glass with a lime slice, add
some salt on it, and carefully pour the mix into
the glass.
Now sit back and enjoy. Viva Mexico!
Margaritas @ home: it’s cocktail time
