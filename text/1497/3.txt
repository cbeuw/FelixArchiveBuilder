Union (CGCU), commented “it was
pretty cool, I guess,” while Craig
Glastonbury, a third year biologist
said, “it was probably one of the
best RCSU events [he’d] ever been
to”, adding “it was busy, but not
so busy that you had to queue for
drinks”. Felix covered the event with
photography which can be seen on the
RCSU Facebook page.
The event attracted many students
across all faculties, seeing even
members of the ICSM committee
attend. The ICSM medics had
reclaimed their mascot from the
RCSU office late last week during a
Hummingbird charity cake sale. Luke
Kanczes said that “they entered the
office in a gang of ten and stole back
the mascot” and that the office was
“left in a mess”, condemning their
behaviour as “morally wrong”.
The Autumn Ball is another example
of the array of well-organised events
hosted by RCSU throughout the year,
with compliments to the committee
for their efforts in planning and
execution. After minor criticisms for
their successful silent disco event last
year, regarding an increased focus on
freshers, the event was advertised as
an Autumn Ball instead which saw
both an increase in familiar crowds
and first years alike.
RCSU Autumn Ball a hit for freshers
Union Council kicks off year
with Bar Night questions
Organisers praised as students are drawn to Embankment by ‘fantastic’ drinks deal
Monday 10 October saw the first Imperi-
al College Union Council meeting of the
academic year. Held in the Union Dining
Hall and open to all students, the meet-
ing saw this year’s sabbatical officers
provide updates of their progress over
the summer, presided over by this year’s
Council Chair, David Smith.
The most contentious issue of the eve-
ning was raised as a result of Deputy
President (Finance & Services) Mi-
chael Foster’s update, and concerned the
Union’s new guidelines regarding how
clubs and societies are able to run bar
nights. In order to ensure bar nights are
‘sustainable’ and to comply with licens-
ing law, the Union is no longer able to
sell kegs of beer at cost price to clubs and
societies. Instead, the Union now offers a
10% discount on bar tabs for bar nights.

Representatives from groups such as the
Royal School of Mines Union and Arts
& Entertainments Board questioned the
new policies, considering issues such as
the feasibility of making money from the
new format of events.
A barrage of freshers descended on
Opal Bar in Embankment on Wednes-
day for the Royal College of Science
Union’s (RCSU) Autumn Ball, where
the faculty hosted their first major
event of the year. Promising three
free drinks, student prices throughout
the night and rides across London on
a vintage fire engine, the RCSU saw
the event quickly become busy from
9pm and maintain unwavering party
spirit to the touted end at 3am.
The RCSU sold out with many
students still trying to get tickets after
the four hundred and fifty-strong
guest list had been sent off. Of those
who attended, general opinion has
been very high and the organisers
have been met with praise.
RCSU President Luke Kanczes
commented that “it was good to see
so many people turn up for the Ball,
not just Scientists but also Engineers
and even Medics, drawn by such
a fantastic drinks deal.” The event
turned over approximately four
thousand pounds, the profit of which
will be donated to RAG.
The RCSU mascot vehicle, Jezebel,
was used to transport students around
Whitehall during the night. James

Foster also announced the existence of
a post-Summer Ball report and survey,
due to be provided at the next Council
meeting Monday 31 October, citing that
the figures were “not ready” in time for
this meeting.
