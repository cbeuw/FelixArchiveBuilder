S
cience fiction often paints a
scary picture of the future
where science and technol-
ogy have run amok with
devastating consequences.
Titles such as Brave New World, The
Day After Tomorrow and Frankenstein
conjure up fearful images in our minds.
Many scientists feel that such works
have hindered progress by creating a
public that is scared of new and poten-
tially beneficial technologies such as
GM and cloning. I think they’re wrong.
Firstly, I do not believe that the vast
majority of “the public” (whoever
the hell that means) are as gullible as
they’re made out to be. To my knowl-

Science fiction
reflects a fear of
technology that many
people innately hold
Frankenscience versus the world
edge people did not develop a sudden
fear of monkeys after watching Planet
of the Apes. In fact people often have
positive reactions to emerging technolo-
gies even after viewing “scary” sci-fi. A
study found that after reading the novel
Prey, where a swarm of nanoparticles
runs riot, people had a more positive
view of nanotechnology compared to
those who had not read the novel. Rath-
er than causing concern, I think that sci-
ence fiction reflects a fear of technology
that many people innately hold.
Secondly, to assume that science fic-
tion “harms” science forgets about its
many benefits; who as a kid was not
inspired to get into science because of
S
o I was told that my pseud-
onym was not particularly
inventive, but that’s sim-
ply what I am: a girl with
opinions. Got a problem
with that!? Then go away and read
something else. I’m here to get nitty
and gritty and talk about the things
that others are too afraid to even think
about. In such a male-dominated uni-
versity, it is imperative for us girls to
stick together and fight for our rights
as equals. I’m not saying that all men
are sexist, but some of them don’t even
realise they are. Like the other day this
guy held a door open for me and I was
like, “I can open doors, you know!
What, you think my arms aren’t strong
enough?”
Boys at Imperial are like children in
a sandpit - everyone wants to play with
the digger, and I’m the digger. Sure, I
keep my hair nice and wear clothes that
accentuate my curves, but I’m not an
object. I don’t dress to impress, I dress
to be the best. I pride myself on look-
ing good, and although I don’t consider
myself to be the most attractive girl at
Imperial, I think boys are magnetized
by my confidence. Girls, if there is
one tip I can give you, it’s be happy in
yourself and your happiness will shine.
I normally find that depressed girls just
give up on themselves and let their hair
go all frizzy and start wearing baggy
jeans. You’re not doing yourselves any
favours by giving up on yourselves.
Don’t give up on yourselves!
When I was a fresher last year, I was
naive and optimistic. I had too much
faith in chivalry and I let myself be-
lieve that I would be surrounded by
Prince Charmings. Err… wrong!!
If you think telling me that ‘my tits
would make a good addition to your
mantlepiece’ is going to succeed in
getting me into your bed, then you’re
very much mistaken. I can take misog-
ynistic comments on the chin because
I’m thick-skinned, but there are some
more vulnerable girls starting at Impe-
rial who wouldn’t know how to handle
a comment like that. Chat-up lines are
a form of sexual harassment and degra-
dation. It’s not funny and it’s definitely
not clever.
Not all the boys are pestilent rats.
Does Science Fiction stand in the way of progress?

the space ships on Star Trek or the mas-
sive dinosaurs on Jurassic Park? I would
hasten a guess that many of you would
not be in science today if it weren’t for
such films. Even professional scientists
are inspired to push the boundaries of
their subjects by sci-fi. The creator of
the mobile phone, Martin Cooper, cred-
its Captain Kirk’s smart gadget as the
inspiration behind the whole idea of a
portable phone.
Positive portrayals of science in sci-fi
are not in short supply. In fact, in a vast
number of films such as Outbreak, Deep
Impact and Independence Day, science
is portrayed as the world’s saviour.
To say that sci-fi in some way hinders
progress is certainly not true – its ben-
efits surely outweigh its disadvantages.
Besides… it doesn’t really matter: sci-
ence fiction is a part of life and noth-
ing’s going to change that. At the end
of the day it’s just a bit of fun – so don’t
get yourselves worried, as I’m sure you
were…
Some of them are actually quite nice,
and I would recommend you take
your time to find the right one. That’s
if you’re looking for anyone at all. If
you’re like me, a free spirit, then you
might just enjoy the company of intel-
ligent guys that don’t see you as ‘walk-
ing pussy’. I’ve got lots of guy friends
that treat me as a lady and an equal
and I’m glad I’ve found them. When
we have our chats, they always listen
to what I have to say and let me say
my piece. Like I say, I’m not afraid to
speak my mind and these guys respect
me for that. If I have one piece of ad-
vice for you girls, it’s take your time
and find the correct social groups for
your needs. I hope you enjoyed read-

Needle in an environmental haystack
L
ondon. A seething, writh-
ing cacophony of activity
by day and a place where
simmering pulses of en-
ergy remain by night. If
there’s one thing you can count on, it’s
that in London, a light is always turned
on somewhere.
Of course, this stands true for the
monopoly of megacities pinned over
the globe, each one raw and exciting
in its own way. However, one residing
within these cities often forgets where
the vast magnitude of energy needed
to run them will come from when our
current reserves of oil and gas drip
their last drop.
In fact, many are energy sceptics –
succumbing to the wave of hysteria
induced by many media outlets. Sure,
two hundred trillion cubic feet of gas
has been found off the coast of Lan-
cashire. Sure, the North Sea remains
an eternal, bottomless vat, but the fact
that numbers can be assigned to these
sources means that we should not rely
on short-term stimuli, and invest our
time in searching for real, ground-
breaking solutions.
Hence I am honoured to be start-
ing my time at Imperial College as an
engineer. There is no hysteria (minus
the abundance of Freshers partying),
no vacuity, but instead an academic
and cultural kaleidoscope. There is
a subtle, all-encompassing allegory
to be derived from it all; by being in
an environment where nothing is the
same as it was before we abandon con-
vention and conformism, we discover
truth from a base starting point.
In the midst of this intellectual clar-
ity, my loan never arrived, some of us
have been to multi-storey nightclubs,
ran all the way home from Piccadil-
ly using our internal compasses, and
some have even drank Jägermeister
from the bottle. Or a bowl ;).
