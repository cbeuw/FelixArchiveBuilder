Well, it’s two weeks into the year, and
those of you who are part of sports
clubs will know that the season’s first
fixtures are fast approaching - and how
important it is to start off on the win-
ning foot. This week, Fencing Men’s 1st
team captain Didier Nohlmans inaugu-
rates our Club Captains interview se-
ries. A member of the team that swept to
BUCS championship gold last season,
he acknowledges that he has pretty big
shoes to fill:
“Last year was indeed a very success-
ful year for Imperial fencing, with both
the men’s and women’s team becom-
ing BUCS champions, so I have a lot to
live up to. The start of the year has been
hectic as usual with lots of new fencers-
both beginners and more experienced
ones.”
The club is indeed a big one, attracting
a lot of interest from freshers (over 200
signed up for taster sessions at freshers’
fair), and while everyone helps out, the
captain does have the time to focus on
the competitive side of things: “most of
the organisational work is done by our
president, Ed Collier, so my main re-
sponsibility so far has been picking this
year’s first team.”
In order to do this, tryouts were orga-
nized last Wednesday. What is the ver-
dict? Can this year’s team emulate its
predecessors and become BUCS cham-
pions?
“Several key first team members from
last year have sadly graduated, so we
were in desperate need of some new
fencers. Luckily, there was plenty of
talent at the trials so I’m confident that
we’ll have a great team and a good year.
Whether we can reproduce last year’s
success remains to be seen, as it also de-
pends on whether our opposition have
improved - but for now I’m going to say
that we definitely have the potential to
become champions again.”
In any case, he still has time to fine-
tune his team and get them fully pre-
pared for the matches: “The fencing
season for the first team starts in Oxford
in November with a round-robin tour-
nament in the southern premier league
(Cambridge, Oxford, Bristol and ULU).
Another round-robin tournament is held
in January here at Imperial against the
same opposition.”
“After this, all teams progress through
to the national knockout stages where
we could come up against anyone as far

Club Captain Interview:
Men’s Fencing
Indy Leclercq awvay as St Andrews.”
I ask him what he hopes to achieve,
and the answer is pretty clear: “All of
this culminates in the national BUCS
finals, which we are certainly hoping to
be at!”
In order to get that far, the team is go-
ing to have to train hard, on top of the
twice-weekly sessions organized by
the Fencing club. According to Didier,
“a lot of our team members also train
at clubs outside Imperial to build up
more experience against different op-
ponents.”
So the objective is fixed, and the date
of the BUCS finals firmly penciled into
this captain’s calendar. But come on -
we want to find out a bit about the peo-
ple behind the trophies, don’t we?
“I’m a physics PhD student, working
in the labs down in the depths of the
physics building. I came here a year ago
and before that I was at Durham for my
undergrad.”
All right, sounds fair, anything else? I
ask him how he got into fencing, and it
turns out there is a bit of a story in there:
“I used to play football at school, but
when I was 13 I had an operation on my
toe and couldn’t play for a few weeks,
so I thought I’d give fencing a go in-
stead. I’ve never looked back since!”
Didier is a sabreur, which means he
fences with a sabre, one of three differ-
ent fencing weapons. While they each
have their own characteristics, and none
is truly “stronger” than the other two,
there is a fair bit of banter between prac-
titioners of the different weapons [Edi-
tor’s note - as a foilist, sabre just seems
to me like two people crashing into each
other with their swords - totally unre-
fined] I ask him why he got into sabre
rather than epée or foil, the other two
weapons.
“Quite simple...all my friends were
doing it. I was lucky enough to be at a
school where the training for sabre was
particularly good so it was a natural
choice for me.”
Ah, good old peer pressure. Well, it
means ICFC have a great sabreur and
competent captain amongst them this
season, so it’s not all bad.
Any last thoughts before letting the
good students carry on with their Friday
pint?
“Actually, when I was captain of the
Durham fencing team, we came down
to fence Imperial for the BUCS quar-
ter finals and got thoroughly destroyed.
Luckily I’ve now changed allegiances!”
Rightly so. Come on Imperial!
...for now, I’m going
to say that we
definitely have the
potential to become
champions again
