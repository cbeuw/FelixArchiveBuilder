Imperial 22 - 20 Portsmouth
Men’s Rugby
1s get off to a
winning start
over
Portsmouth
Imperial’s 1st XV got their season off
to a positive start with a narrow win
over Portsmouth at Harlington. On a
day where the weather conditions were
unusually favorable, Imperial made it
difficult to overcome their stubborn op-
position.
Despite the close full time score,
Imperial started the much stronger of
the two sides. It appeared as though
the three weeks of intense pre season
which Imperial had undergone was
going to pay off.
For the first twenty minutes Impe-
rial played their pattern to perfection,
using forwards through the midfield
to great effect whist the backs looked
comfortable with ball in hand. Impe-
rial’s dominance was so telling that
Portsmouth struggled to leave their 22
for the first ten minutes of the match.
Such intense pressure was sure to
result in a score sooner, rather than
later and the first points were scored
by Sean Baker. Good ball at the lin-
eout just inside the Portsmouth 22
meter line was driven on by the for-
wards with Baker controlling well at
the back and slumping over once the
necessary yards were made.
Imperial should have pushed on
from such a positive position, but it
was not to be. Switching off at the re-
start allowed Portsmouth to turn the
ball over and spread it out wide to
touch down in the corner and level the
scores.
Encouragingly though, Imperial hit
back and after good play within Ports-
mouth’s half, soft hands from Chris
McGeough and James Cox allowed
Flannan Mahony to go over in the
right corner.
Worryingly for Imperial, Mike
Floyd suffered a stinger on his shoul-
der towards the end of the first half
which lead to a reshuffle in the backs;
Olly Cox took up position at 10, a po-
sition in which again, he did not look
entirely comfortable; kicking the ball
out on the full on more than one oc-
casion. Imperial went into the break
with a comfortable 17-5 lead thanks to
a third try of the match from George
Lane.
Imperial really should have capital-
ised on their lead and used their fitness
to overcome their opponents in the
second half yet they got caught up in
a messy struggle. Floyd had recovered
from his previous knock and returned
to the fray allowing Cox to move back
to his usual position of scrum half
where he looked more assured. De-
spite the balance of the team appear-
ing to be restored, Imperial made hard
work of overcoming their opposition.
Portsmouth ran in two tries, both
of which can be attributed to poor
defence; firstly missed tackles in the
midfield and secondly a mismatch in
numbers out wide. It became apparent
that Imperial were involved in a real
contest and whilst being in control of
the match, Portsmouth were only two
points behind.
Imperial’s fourth try came courtesy
of captain Charlie Esberger, making
up for squandering a scoring oppor-
tunity from a metre out previously in
the match.
Portsmouth were not about to give
up without a fight however, and scored
their fourth try of the match in the fi-
nal play. Their kicker was not able
to convert the extras however, which
would have drawn the match.
Despite appearing to have suffered
a let off for their inconsistent play,
Imperial were able to come away with
an important win in their opening fix-
ture of the year. There were positives
to take from the match and build upon
as the season progresses during a year
when the team looks to be promoted.
