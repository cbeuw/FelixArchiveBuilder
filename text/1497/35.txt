Dishoom, one of the best Bombay Cafés
that London has to offer?
One minute away from Leicester
Square Station, Dishoom offers great
Indian food at great prices in an ex-
traordinary yet cosy atmosphere.
dian food, as I don’t like spicy dishes, I
found out that there are many interest-
ing ones. I really loved the fish fingers
with the sweet sauce.
M: Well, Dishoom is a traditional In-
dian restaurant but at the same time
its menu offers a broad choice of both
spicy, non-spicy and also vegetarian
dishes.
A: Yes, this is absolutely true. I am
wondering why you chose that spicy
cocktail drink. I mean, we tried many
spicy dishes like the house black daal
- you should have got a sweet cocktail
like the Bombay Colada.
M: A spicy cocktail like Chilli Mar-
tini may sound weird but it matches
perfectly with most of the dishes and
surely completes their taste. What did
you think of the “Fish Ruby”? I have to
admit I’m used to curry combined with
chicken but that was a blast!
A: That’s why it was the speciality of
the day, it was special indeed! One of
the best dishes that should be included
in the menu. You know what? You may
find it silly, but what I enjoyed the most
was Raita. Mouthwatering and refresh-
ing! Together with the garlic bread it
was the best side dish.
M: I totally understand. Even if you
are not into spicy foods, just combin-
ing them with a yoghurt dip - like Raita
- can just make you think about the fla-
vours spices trigger. I particularly like
the fact that you have so many choices.
No need to limit your selection to 1
dish; Just order three, four maybe five
plates and share them among the table!
A: Yes indeed, it gives you the oppor-
tunity to enjoy many different dishes.
Have you noticed that we have finished
our three course meal in just one hour?

A: I literally can’t move at the moment.
I’m full. You should have stopped me
after the fifth dish!
M: What could I have done? Every-
thing was great! However, there’s al-
ways space for some extra Dishoom
calamari.
A: Oh yeah, all the dishes were fantas-
tic. Although I am not a big fan of In-
M: That was very impressive, the ser-
vice is splendid. Dishes are properly
cooked and presented, the waiters and
waitresses look very keen to assist you
and that really contributes to the over-
all experience.
A: I totally agree. Dishoom has a very
warm atmosphere and it was packed,
even though it was a Wednesday. For-
tunately, we made a reservation.
M: That’s just more proof of how pop-
ular Dishoom is.
A: Oh come on! Tell me about the
desserts! Personally I couldn’t resist
taking my usual; chocolate fondant,
yummy!
M: Ok, I’m gonna admit it: I did try
some of your fondant while you were
away from the table! There, I said it!
But you stole some of my delicious
pineapple & black pepper crumble ...
and not just once!
A: I just wanted to try the combina-
tion of pineapple, honey, oats and ice-
cream...
M: I forgot to ask you, why did I have
to carry my camera with me?
A: Oh lord... we were supposed to take
some photos! But as soon as the food
arrived, I couldn’t think of anything
but eating!
M: So, when are we visiting Dishoom
again?
A: Are you free next week?
M: Sure!
A: So you’d recommend it huh?
M: Totally!

Last issue, Felix Food made mention
of the Chocolate Week, the London
Restaurant Festival and the Diwali
Festival. It’s likely some of you dis-
like chocolate, hate restaurant festi-
vals or think Indian food is just anoth-
er thing that drags you to the toilet!
So, let’s talk about cheese… and wine!
The Cheese & Wine Festival is
taking place on 14 – 16 Oct at the
Southbank Centre Square in London.
A wide range of stalls will be show-
casing the highest quality cheeses
and wines from the UK and around
the world. As with any self-respect-
ing festival, it will also offer many
exciting activities. There are going
to be many cooking demonstrations
by celebrity chefs such as Valentina
Harris and Tim Atkin! However, if
you think that watching someone
cook is boring, you may join me in
an Australian wine tasting session
with Brian Oakwell - or a cheese
and beer pairing of La Cave à From-
age & Meantime Brewery, who said
just brilliantly: “What two foods are
made for each other more than beer
and cheese… Cheese is beer back-
wards, or beer is cheese backwards.”
Finally and most importantly, all
of us are either students or (very)
hard-working employees and are
aware that fine cheese and wine can
be a bit…expensive. Admission to the
Cheese & Wine festival is FREE*. It’s
as if it was organized especially for
us! So remember: do not have lunch
at Queen’s Tower or the Library Café.
Brace yourself for a cheesy evening
and quench your thirst with plenty of
wine! Doctor’s instructions: Repeat
on Saturday and Sunday.
* A ticket is required for tutored
tasting with Tim Atkin and seating is
limited.
