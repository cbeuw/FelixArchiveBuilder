What’s on
Lolcat of teh week
Last week’s Foldi winner
As the man says, there can be only
one, and that one just happens to
be Yao Du, who wins last week’s
super prize of a Foldi LED Lamp.
Congrats! I’ll be in touch.
Proof of God Debate:
Round 2
The Philosophy Society is putting together another
intellectual debate on campus. Like last year we
have invited Dr Muhammad Omer and Hassan
Choudhury, but this time, we have more opinionated
atheists: Dr John Marenbon and Dr Derek Matravers,
so it should be a more animated show!
If you have a strong opinion regarding the debate,
we’d really like to hear from you. Why don’t you email
your response to us and we can read them out be-
fore the debate on the day. If you feel there is/isn’t
rational proof, or it’s not a debate that can be had
rationally, please visit our Facebook page or email
us at philosophy@ic.ac.uk. See you on the day!
Last week it was competitions (more
coming soon!) – this week the Classifieds
section makes a bite-sized return.
If you have something to sell, whether it’s
a laptop, a pile of untouched books or
some incredible Python programming skills,
let us know and we’ll advertise it right
here in the paper. Nothing dodgy please,
we’re distribution bins, not top shelf.
We’d also better say that Felix accepts no
responsibility for services bought or sold.
While we’re on this topic of shameless
advertising, does someone want to paint a
local garage door? I’m not even joking.
Classifieds: the return
