Wordoku
Don’t look so surprised y’all, you know
how this works by now, surely? Every
row, column and three by three square
must contain each letter once. The end
result is a rather useless word or phrase.
What? Fine, go do your computation-
al labs if you don’t want to play. I just
thought... you know... it might be fun...

Nonogram - Killing Time
The aim with Slitherlink is to make one continuous closed
loop by connecting the dots. The numbers in each square in-
dicate how many edges of the square are part of the loop, so
if it contains a “2”, you know that two and only two out of
four edges have lines. That’s all the info you need to get the
one logical answer (though waiting a week to see the solution
will also do). Answers to puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk, as
the puzzles team recieves a shiny penny per correct solution.
Nonograms are logic puzzles in which cells in a grid have to be coloured or
left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid. The numbers measure
how many unbroken lines or filled-in squares there are in any given row or
column. Last week’s solution gives an idea of what it should look like.
