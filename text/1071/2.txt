News in Brief
Security resorts to dogs
V A S K O R B A S A K
As a result of the one-day strike last
week, a temporary reduction in the
ievel of security occurred within the
Imperial College estate, necessitating
contract guards and dogs for site
patrols. Despite a skeleton crew cov-
ering the twelve absent staff, the
extra men were drafted in to make up
numbers.
Although contract security staff
were hired they only replaced three
of the twelve absentees. This was
partly due to the security staffs' trade
union regulations, as there are limita-
tions on the number of temporary
staff that can be hired at one time.
There has also been some controver-
sy about whether the temporary staff
were justified in bringing three dogs
to assist with security operations.
Keith Reynolds, Head of Security
and Fire at IC, who made the request
to bring in the dogs, said that they
were mainly there to protect the
2,000 residents in Prince's Gardens.
Due to IC regulations, the tempo-
rary security guards were not permit-
ted to carry swipecards. This has
caused concern among residents that
their safety would have been jeopar-
dised in the event of a fire or bur-
glary. Swipe cards are only issued to
people employed for longer than
three months, although a special
allowance was made and they were
given them before the end of the
duty. This was particularly awkward
when a bar alarm was set off at
Princes' Gardens, which was mistak-
en for afirealarm.
The proper security staff took
turns to go on duty during the night
shift in order to ensure that there was
always some level of security
throughout the strike. According to
Ken Weir, Head of Security at IC,
the main role of the contract security
staff was for "perimeter control" and
"a minimal security presence" was
kept during the strike.
Talking to Felix, Keith Reynolds
said that the two main aims during
the strike were to have adequate
security to be prepared for emergen-
cies such as fire, and to protect the
residents. He said that in a short time
it was needed to "put something in
place without inflaming the situa-
tion." since the ICU and the adminis-
tration office only responded to the
situation at the last minute.
CRIME O N C A M P U S
A man has admitted to over 60
crimes on the Imperial College cam-
pus after being questioned in a joint
investigation being conducted by the
Belgravia Police and IC Security.
Three men were arrested and
brought in for questioning in connec-
tion with 200 crimes in the local area
and it was only when one of the three
decided to confess that IC Security
were brought in to help.
Most of the crimes committed on
campus, since the beginning of 1995
were walk-in burglaries, where the
guilty party told police that he was let
into Southside and Beit halls of resi-
dence by students. Stolen items
ranged from cash and walkmans to
more expensive items, mobile
phones and, in one particularly suc-
cessful mission, a laptop computer.
Security have been unable to
locate 48 of the crimes in their report
files, perhaps because many of them
could be described as minor and so
are not reported.Ken Weir, Head of
Security at IC, is interested in any
information regarding the investiga-
tion and wishes to remind students to
lock their doors and to check the
identity of people they don't recog-
nise entering the halls.
RCSU RESIGNATIONS
The Royal College of Science Union
received a double whammy recently,
with the resignation of both the
Honorary Junior Treasurer and the
Honorary Senior Treasurer.
Dr Ann Mitchell, HST for several
years, is to be employed on a part-
time "contract" basis from the begin-
ning of the new year. According to
the RCSU constitution, these terms
disqualify her from holding the pos-
tion of HST, leaving her very little
choice but to resign.
Chris Bragg, HJT from 1994-
1996, resigned after tiring of people
who failed to follow Imperial
College Union financial procedure.
He intends to use the time to concen-
trate on his final year project. The
Union president, Mo Dulloo, agrees
with Mr Bragg that "there are people
who are quite 'clueless' about finan-
cial policy, no matter how much they
are told about it...this flippant non-
compliance of regulations has put
increasing pressure on Chris."
The position of HJT will tem-
porarily be taken over by Honorary
Secretary Rob Park, additional to his
current responsibilities within the
Union.
CLUSTER'S L A S T S T A N D
European space scientists have
launched a bid to resurrect the failed
Cluster satellite mission, destroyed
in the disasterous explosion of the
Ariane V rocket last June (Felix
1060).
British scientists must secure £7
million towards a second mission
which, it is hoped, could be rebuilt
for less than a third of the cost of the
original.
If given the go-ahead, 'Cluster IF
will employ four identical probes to
examine interactions between the
earth's magnetic field and the Solar
wind, and carry instruments designed
and built by a team led by Imperial
College physicists. A decision from
the European Space Agency is
expected this week.
S T U D E N T L O A N DEBTS
T O BE PRIVATISED
The key feature of the Budget this
Tuesday was a penny cut in Income
Tax, which the Chancellor has
promised for next year. To finance
this benevolent scheme he has been
forced to look for money elsewhere.
One of the major sources of cash is
planned to be the sale of student debt
which is expected to raise £3 billion
for the exchequer. As the Chancellor
put it, "it makes no sense for the
Government to keep a huge portfolio
of loans on its books when the pri-
vate sector could manage it more
effectively and is better placed with
the risk." He went on to assure that
the sale would have no effect upon
the terms on which student loans are
granted, though he gave no guarantee
that this situation would continue
after subsequent Budgets.
In effect, this amounts to the virtu-
al privatisation of student loans, from
now on students will not owe money
to the state, but instead they will owe
it a private, profit making company.
This would suggest that either the
rules governing the repayment of
loans will be tightened up to make
the whole system more profitable,
which Kenneth Clarke has promised
will not happen, or that the govern-
ment will face problems in selling off
the system, as it did when itfirsttried
to privatise the schemefiveyears ago
when it was forced to change it's
plans as none of the major banks
showed any interest in the venture.
Either way, students are unlikely to
benefit, as from the £3 billion raised,
only 7% has been set aside for uni-
versities.
