Simon Wistow investigates the sudden
arrival ofcults on campus....
The London Church of Christ, a reli-
gious group that has been banned
from several universities and brand-
ed a cult by every denomination of
the church, has decided that IC has
just the right mix of desperate, lone-
ly and impressionable people to
make it worth their while canvassing
us. Members have been approaching
students and inviting them to their
Wednesday lunch time bible studies.
They appear friendly at first, offer-
ing hospitality yet when you go to
their meetings those questions that
you really wanted to ask have been
left strangely unfulfilled (much like
lectures then) a tell-tale sign of being
lied to (that's also a handy hint for
dealing with your boyfriend/girl-
friend by the way).
If you get any further than that
you will be assigned your very own
'discipler' the person who will get to
know you,findyour weak spots and
insert wedges into them however
you just feel special because some-
one is paying so much attention to
you. They encourage you to work
hard (actually in itself that is a minor
miracle), the only way you will get
to heaven, and dissuade you from
spending any spare time at social
events, with friends and family and
even down the pub. As you devote
yourself more and more to the cult
you will start failing your degree
and the discipler will make more and
more decisions in your life; how
much money you give to the church
and who you go out with. You are
encouraged to date a different per-
son within the cult each week and
Hypnosis - inducing a state of high
suggestibility by hypnosis, often thinly
disguised as relaxation or meditation.
Peer Group Pressure - Suppressing
doubt and resistance to new ideas by
exploiting the need to belong.
Love Bombing - Creating a sense of
family and belonging through hugging,
kissing, touching and flattery.
Rejection of Old Values -
Accelerating acceptance of new life-
style by constantly denouncing former
values and beliefs.
Removal of privacy - Achieving loss
of ability to evaluate logically by pre-
venting private contemplation.
Time Sense Deprivation - Destroying
ability to evaluate information, person-
may only go steady with someone
your discipler agrees on. You are
offered a flat where your remaining
study time is monopolised and you
are subjected to sleep and food
deprivation making you just that bit
more susceptible. Before long you
are heavily into the cult and possibly
even a discipler yourself.
One member of Imperial College
tells of his involvement with the
cult:-
"My first contact with the Central
London Church of Christ (CLCC)
came during my second year at IC.
They gave a brief talk which encour-
aged me to examine the Bible. This
was soon followed up by intensive
bible studies. At that time I had no
religious background and I thought
that religion created more problems
than it could solve but I was initially
impressed by their friendliness and
their efforts to express their faith to
me. I was eventually baptised in the
Serpentine in Hyde Park on one cold
November evening. Then came the
heavy discipleship and the numer-
ous meetings that I was expected to
attend. I was also expected to cut
down on my involvement in the IC
clubs and societies. I kept question-
ing about this matter but I was just
told that "I had a bad attitude"
towards the leaders. Worse was yet
to come, I was invited round to a
leaders house one evening and I was
told to leave my girlfriend, who was
also in the Church, and to join their
church dating scheme! You were
encouraged to date different people,
Methods of

Uncompromising Rules

Verbal Abuse - Desensitising

Dress Codes - Removing individ-
uality by demanding conformity to
the group dress code.

but your discipler effectively con-
trolled who you were allowed to go
steady with. This scheme and the
concerns for my study if I tried to
meet every expectation of the lead-
ers, put me off the church! After
hearing how they publicly con-
demned other churches as being
demon possessed, I left the church.
Several unsuccessful attempts were
made to bring me back, but eventual-
ly they lost interest in me as a fol-
lower, and sadly as a friend as well.
"In retrospect, I have found the
initial friendliness of members of the
CLCC rather superficial and moti-
vated by the intention of dragging
people into their church and teach-
ing. This cult can seriously affect
your personal and emotional life. A
good friend of mine was doing rela-
tively well in his degree, before his
involvement in the CLCC and ended
up failing his finals. I would like to
urge students to steer clear from any
involvement with the CLCC and be
wary of its deceptions. There are
many good Christian Societies that
are recognised in College and who
are prepared to give you help and
advice.
So, how can you avoid all this has-
sle? Well, the best way is to ask them
who they represent. The are unlikely
to deny their own Church although
they may use any of these aliases:
-Central London Church of Christ
-North London Literature Society
-North London Historological
Society.
The Cult Information Centre's
"Cults on campus" leaflet offers
some advice:
"very few people ever set out to
become members of cults on heir
own. Regardless of how vulnerable
people may be, if they do not meet a
recruiter there is little chance of them
joining a cult."
Cults are EXPERTS at manipula-
tion using sophisticated techniques
that will work on anybody given the
right circumstances. Those who
think they are immune are, in fact,
only making themselves more vul-
nerable. It does not matter how intel-
ligent you think you are:- they
assault your emotions not your intel-
lect. The two basic principles of psy-
chological control are
If you can make a person
BEHAVE they way you want you
can make them BELIEVE the way
you want.
Sudden, drastic changes in envi-
ronment lead to heightened sug-
gestibility and to drastic changes in
attitudes and beliefs.
Therefore they will try to exploit
you in times of stress; exam pressure,
broken relationships, feelings of
loneliness, social group pressure,
major decisions to be made. If this
happens talk to someone you know
and trust such as a friend, parent or
lecturer, one of the many hot lines
available. There is always the
College Councillor or the Chaplain.
Remember these people are not
interested in helping you, only them-
selves. Trusting them could lead to
separation from your family, friends,
financial resources and your ability
to think for yourself.
