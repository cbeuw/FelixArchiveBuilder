St Mary's research casts shadow
over World AIDS Day
JACKIE S K E A T E
Results from an HIV testing pro-
gramme at St Mary's Hospital has
shown that Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome is fast on the
increase in London. With World
AIDS Day coming up on the 1st
December, this implies that the gen-
eral public still need to be more
aware of the increasing risks of
catching AIDS.
At St Mary's Hospital, blood sam-
ples from patients in the accident and
emergency unit are tested for HIV. In
1992-1993, about 1 in 77 people test-
ed were infected. Now, results sug-
gest that up to 75% of people with
HIV either do not know they have it,
or are not declaring it
"There is a belief that HIV has
plateaued out or is actually declining,
but our study suggests that it may be
premature to believe this," warned
Mark Poznansky, an epidemiology
specialist at St Mary's. These results
highlight ongoing concerns that
infected blood can spill in accident
and emergency departments, mean-
ing that hospital workers must take
more precautions to avoid transmis-
sion of the disease.
Next week, the Union will organ-
ise stands in the JCR and Union
building, giving out information
leaflets and free condoms, and the
proceeds from Friday's AIDS aware-
ness party night are being donated
towards AIDS research.
Speaking about World AIDS Day,
Sarah Corneille, Deputy President
for Clubs and Societies, said "There
is still a big problem with people
being generally uninformed about
AIDS. People have phobias about it.
It's also difficult to educate people
about it without being patronising
and talking to them as though they
were about six years old. Hopefully,
all the publicity might be especially
helpful to people from other cultures
who may not be as aware about the
virus."
Learning how to rock your vote
NEWSTEAM
Hands up how may people have
heard of Rock the Vote. They are a
non profit-making organisation dedi-
cated to encouraging young people to
vote. They are themselves apolitical,
and have the support of the three
major political parties.
This is a major issue that needs
addressing. The statistics show that
people under the age of 25 make up
16% of the electorate, and only about
half of the under 25 age group voted
in the 1992 election. The reasons for
this are difficult to pin down. Young
people aren't all apathetic. They care
about current political issues. One of
the problems seems to be that they
are becoming disenchanted with the
process of parliamentary democracy,
and an underlying feeling that, how-
ever they vote, it won't change any-
thing really. Many have not bothered
to register, partly because they may
not be sure how to go about it, and
partly to avoid paying council tax.
Since April, Rock the Vote have
been distributing simplified registra-
tion cards and handing them out at
concert venues and nightclubs. In
fact, today the NUS are holding a
Rock the Vote club night across the
country. However, having registered,
people then need encouragement to
use their vote.
The desire of political parties to
win over the younger generation has
been very much in evidence. Of
course the only guaranteed way to
win votes off anyone is to sort out
poverty, homelessness, the NHS and
unemployment. Having your photo
taken with Damon Albarn or Eddie
Izzard wouldn't, you would think,
make much difference. People may
buy celebrity-endorsed food, but they
won't go for a celebrity-endorsed
country.
As no doubt everyone knows well,
there has to be a General Election
soon, before May 29th. That means
we'll probably see increasing num-
bers of politicians making complete
naked arses of themselves in public
pretending they are young and trendy
in a desperate last-ditch attempt to
gain votes. This is like seeing some-
one's grandparents showing off at a
disco - highly embarrassing and you
have to feel a bit sorry for them - but
it's hundreds of times worse because
it's on a nationwide scale.
While only you can make the deci-
sion, it is really in your interests to
vote, because, like it or not, it's more
or less the only way to get your say in
how the country is run. If you
haven't yet registered, the Labour
Society and Conservative Society are
jointly organising a stand in the
Union foyer where you can register
yourself on the electoral roll. This
will be on Wednesday 4th
December, from 12-2pm. If you miss
that, you can also register on the
internet at:

IC Nobel
Scientist dies
A M B E R S A L E E M
This week, many in the scientific
community mourned the death of
one of the most prominent particle
physicists of this century. Nobel
Prize winner, Professor Abdus
Salam, made significant contribu-
tions to science and education
throughout his career, most of which
was spent at Imperial College.
Born in 1926 in a small town in
North Pakistan, Salam was educated
at the Government College in
Lahore. He went on to study at St
John's College, Cambridge where he
later became a lecturer and a Fellow.
He was appointed Head of the
Mathematics Department at Punjab
University in 1951. He left Asia in
1957 to join Imperial College,
founding the Theoretical Physics
Department. Until his retirement in
1993 he was one of the most highly
respected and distinguished mem-
bers of the Physics Department.
Salam specialised in particle
physics and field theory, developing
a unified theory of weak and electro-
magnetic interactions. This led to
him being awarded the Nobel Prize
in 1979 alongside Glashow and
Weinburg.
In 1964, he founded, and became
Director of, the International Centre
for Theoretical Physics in Trieste,
Italy, which is now has a global rep-
utation for its research and develop-
ment. Salam remained in Italy for
several years working on further
extensions of the Unification Theory
of Fundamental Forces and super-
symmetry.
Professor Salam played active
roles in many worldwide organisa-
tions. He founded and became
President of the Third World
Academy of Science, whose main
objectives were to encourage scien-
tific advancements in the developing
world.
In 1988, he formed a network of
scientific organisations concentrat-
ing on the importance of science to
developing world governments.
Professor Salam also had major
influence as a scientific advisor to
the United Nations Educational
Scientific and Cultural Organisation.
Professor Salam made a major
impact on Twentieth Century sci-
ence and was accredited many acco-
lades and awards. He was well liked
and respected by both colleagues
and members of his community and
will be sorely missed by those of us
who were honoured enough to have
known him personally.
