IC Seconds Secure BUSA Shield place
With a place in the last 32 at stake,
Goran spiced up team by threatening
to reveal his candyfloss if we lost.
As the game started, IC applied
their awesome pressure. The game
began to flow over the quim like
pitch as some strange bald guy decid-
ed to become some strange blind
guy, and become oblivious to the
fouls committed by UMDS as he
allowed them to weave a path to the
IC goal. 1-0.
IC were so taken aback by this
goal that they steeled themselves
against this abrasive side. Solid IC
play led to an equaliser from Goran,
a radical piece of movement from
Lightweight. After this, UMDS
pressed ever forward with increasing
verve. The IC defensive line of Bill,
Flash, Lalas and Monkey Magic held
Half-time
vodka can't
keep spirits up
in downpour
The Mixed Hockey team turned up
raring to go, but the match failed to
live up to our hopes.
The best way to describe this
game is in terms of the goalie, who
was shit. Stalwart defence by IC
together with some inspirational
attacking from Katrina and Soren
made sure we ended thefirst-halfon
equal terms with Barts. Despite the
rain, IC spirits were raised by half-
time Vodka. Thanks Soren.
Filed up and raring to go, we start-
ed the second-half with the goalie
deciding to kill everyone who came
near him, and with a swift deflection
of his kicker, he put the ball in the
back of the net.
The game restarted with more
Barts attacks, but quick thinking by
James, with swift movement of the
ball, created a flowing move, with
the ball ultimately slotted in by Tim.
With the rain reducing visibility,
the game edged towards a stalemate,
before the cunning play from Barts
found them with a huge overlap in
the D. Despite the goalie's lethal
intent they scored again. Damn.
The post-match celebrations led
to Soren losing the bargames, his
dignity, and his eyebrows.
firm with a resolute display of their
absurdly amazing defensive talents.
More thoughtful play from the
right-half and wing combination of
PD File and Son of Brazil led to a
mazy dribble from George Michael
which led to such an amazing goal
that we just broke out the
Wensleydale cheese and port to cele-
brate. The matchflowedbetween the
two halves until half-time.
The second-half started and IC
again proved to be the dominant
force, with Rick's Colossal Penis
showing it's worth as UMDS were
berated with relentless IC pressure.
Bill showed his lack of knowledge
by passing the ball to Goran instead
of Monkey Magic. Cheese Head.
The rest of the second-half was
U L U Karate take Great Britain
and European titles
A spectacular all-round perfor-
mance from the University of
London Karate team - containing
two IC students - resulted in victo-
ry at the recent UK champi-
onships. This comes in addition to
the European championships
which ULU have won for the last
two years.

notable only for sterling work on the
left-wing by Rab, as he ravished their
defence. Oh, and they scored a sec-
ond goal to send the match into extra-
time.
Extra-time started with UMDS
ever dominant - if it had not been for
superlative work from Worzel, they
would have scored more than the one
they needed. Sideline support
increased with such vigour that in the
second-half of extra-time IC could
not fail to score. Goran and Shaggy
took advantage of UMDS's forward
play to create an overlap, and the
moment created allowed cartoon
reject Shaggy to slot home the win-
ner with under a minute left to play.
All in all a fantastic performance
from the seconds with a great team
effort. Yeeha - we play on.
Sport in brief
R U G B Y S E C O N D S
Eighty minutes of pure enjoyment to
watch. From the outset IC Seconds
played a hard, full-contact game. It
was the second round of BUSA, and
the aggression amongst the fifteen
young gentlemen, brought a tear to
the eye of the proud spectator. The
forwards were powerful, showing a
destructive power in the scrums,
rucks and mauls. They were mobile,
agile and demonstrated superb unity
in the set-plays. This was empha-
sised by a push-over try capitalised
on early in the second-half, by
Grandad Bryce. If space wasn't so
limited, individual glorification of all
eight would be included, especially
Martin "Floating" Ayre.
LADIES RUGBY
Defensively and offensively sound,
the ball flowed sweetly between
hands. However, the utmost credit
goes to the defensive tackling and
kicking under pressure. This effort
was represented by the ever reliable
Kolone, touching down in the cor-
ner. The only dilemma of the day
was how Charrington Cross man-
aged to clinch it.
H O C K E Y THIRDS V R S M
We lost to RSM, 2-0. A disappoint-
ment? No - they had some good
players and they put up a, ahem,
good performance.
