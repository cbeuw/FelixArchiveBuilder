F E L I X FRIDAY 29TH N O V E M B E R SPORT 15
U L U Karate victorious in
Nationals thanks to IC students
On the 23rd of this month the 14 peo-
ple from the University of London
(ULU) Karate Club attended the
KUGB student Championships held
in Chesterfield. The KUGB is the
largest Karate Organisation in the
UK and most university clubs are
affiliated to it. The event is normally
a big occasion and attracts many uni-
versity teams and students studying
at other institutions. The quality is
high and blood flows freely.
The ULU team are currently
European Champions, a tide which
they have won for two years running.
It is also the first uni-based team to
win the Southern Regional open and
gain a seeding for the Open
Nationals, after they kicked it earlier
this year. The team picks up numer-
ous trophies and titles throughout the
year, including at the BUSA
Nationals.
This is the one, however, that peo-
ple fear! Physically demanding and
very tough, months of intensive
training went into this.
Saturday 23rd kicked off with the
KATA events. Katas are formal
exercises (combinations of pre-set
moves that have been passed on from
generation to generation). Although
one of three key cornerstones of
modem day Karate, Godwin and Ed
DoSantos (the IC contribution)
neglected this event in order to stay
focused on the KUMl'lL or sparring.
Captained by T. Hughes (former
IC) and coached by S. Hastings
(England KUGB Squad), the team
came first.
We were quite confident in our
pool of clubs/unis but were weary of
some of the bigger names. We were
certainly glad that we didn't have to
face the Liverpool team early on,
who comprise of many good fighters
and some members of the infamous
Red Triangle Dojo. But we had the
Manchester five which had some
international fighters in their ranks.
(Godwin had one of them and lost by
one Wazari - half point - in a very
close fight). London, however, tri-
umphed by a total of three fights to
two. We were fighting better and
gaining in confidence as the day pro-
gressed thanks to some good captain-
cy and blasting coaching. We
reached the semifinals, where we
came up against Aberystwyth. This
team was previously fairly unknown,
but we granted them the respect due
considering the teams they had beat-
en to get there.
With nerves on the line everyone
knew what was expected of them.
Godwin had a good, clean fight with
only one warning against a jumping
sweep attack followed up with a
backfist. He finally won with a front
leg sweep followed by a Kizami
Zuki -jabbing punch) to put London
through to the finals.
We awaited news from the other
mats and were not surprised to learn
that Liverpool had beaten last years
winners, Leeds, by 3 - 1 with one
fight drawn. Oh well...
In the individual events, the
London team fighters (Tony,
Godwin, Edwin, Rami and Lewis) all
got off to good starts. T. Hughes was
one of the favourites having come
third in the Shotokan Cup two
months ago. He had to beat two
England fighters to get there. Rami
(University College Hospital) is a
strong and useful fighter who joined
us from the Cambridge ranks after
completing his first degree. Lewis is
small but quick, agile with plenty of
stamina. Godwin is bigger and more
powerfull with deceptively deft tim-
ing and reflexes (Ed is a dancer and a
beautiful one at that).
We were knocking out people with
increasing difficulty, and after each
round we were all pleased that every-
one else had stayed in. London was
looking good. Lewis fell first, to be
shortly followed by John, our reserve
from St George's. Then came the
round before the quarter finals and
things were closing down. Ed had to
fight Rami, as they had both been
pooled together. They knew each
other well, having fought in training
and sparred with one another fre-
quently. Ed's footwork and nimble-
ness gave him the edge on the day
and he was through to the quarters.
Godwin, meanwhile, was having a
good time on his mat, that is until
disaster struck (actually a fist).
Godwin was up at the time and had
all the play when his opponent
became increasingly desperate. He
let off a right hook, knocked out G's
gumshield and almost two of his
teeth. The Midlander, was disquali-
fied for excessive and uncontrolled
techniques. But there was no more
quarter final and straight off to hos-
pital for Godwin. Skank. If it had
been in the next round, G. would
have been guaranteed another medal-
lion... Living skank!
Ed, however, had progressed to
the semi-finals. We were now guar-
anteed at least one of the ULU team
in the final. Ed-son was unlucky as,
(and I say this as an unbiased
bystander), some of the referees were
blind to his techniques and a majori-
ty must be confident. There was no
shame however, as his opponent was
also a great fighter. Ed picked up the
bronze, and had to re-focus his atten-
tion on the team finals. Tony Hughes
was a bit unfortunate in that his
opponent in the final apparently ran
his face into Tony's fist. The result
was a crashed nose and a disqualifi-
cation. T., therefore, picked up the
silver.
G was back from hospital in time
for the final, which was held in the
evening. As we now had to field our
reserve, there was no scope for error.
The brunt fell on Tony, Ed-son and
Rami. Beforehand, we had four out
of five very strong fighters. So, for
the team to win, one of us could
afford to drop a fight and still come
through with a 3-2 margin. We now
couldn't afford such a luxury.
Ed was upfirst.The kid was psy-
ched up to the max. It showed when
he went out there-. Earlier on, you
could shout, 'Ed dance', and he
would give you a few (Hollywood
shuffles to keep you smiling. Now it
was purely business. He must have
won in under a minute.
The next two were our reserve and
most junior grade. We went down,
twice. Next up was Tony. He had a
good fight and there was only one
scary moment when it was feared
that he cracked the other guy too
hard. Two each with one fight
remaining. The man Rami had it all
to prove.
The fight started tentatively with
both fighters moving around and
testing each others reflexes and fight-
ing style. (Does he go all defensive
when under attack or does he stand
his ground? Is he a kicker or a punch-
er? Is his guard adequate or is he con-
centrating more on attacking you?....
Does he dance well?).
The fight went on and no points
were won, then crash. Rami got
caught at what seemed like impossi-
ble range. Half a point down the
whistle sounded for thirty seconds
left. The ULU team had stopped
screaming at this point and the only
voices you could hear were those of
the coach and the captain. (When
you're losing and under pressure
with the whole world to pay if you
lose, the last thing you need is some-
one, who thinks he knows what he's
talking about, to start hollering at
you). By 20 seconds, we knew that
R. would have to play things his own
way. Then, quick as you like, he was
in there to even the score with a solid
blow to the body. Hundreds of peo-
ple erupted but it could still go either
way. We were all still sweating
buckets.
The Scouser attacked, Rami coun-
tered. Rami moved around looking
for an opening. He couldn't see one
and backed off. His opponent took a
chance and an attack was launched, a
flurry of kicks and punches. Rami is
very quick (which G. learnt the hard
way in a training session). The
attacker was caught and swept. With
a fully open back, he was in there.
Bang, bang - twice. The referee
called his judges together for consul-
tation before deciding upon the out-
come. A full-point Ippon in the dying
seconds meant that London was now
the Great Britain and European
Student Champions.
Godwin was a member of the
squad that triumphed in Europe last
year. There is a warm and grateful
welcome to Ed DoSantos who joined
us from the IC Club, after the suc-
cessful entrance of Leo Khale (for-
mer IC Karate). Unfortunately, due
to other commitments, the latter
could not join us on this occasion.
We would love to go back to
Europe to defend our unbeaten two-
year stint but ULU sports travel
grants are rapidly running thin. We
would need sponsorship to the tune
of a few hundred pounds to finance
just one team going out there for the
6th-8th December. Anyone who
could be of assistance , please e-mail
