What does the Budget mean to me?
CIGARETTES A N D
A L C O H O L
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke was kind
to fellow drinkers on Tuesday, but
cigarette smokers and bulk-boozers
will still have to cross the channel to
make significant savings. Although
prices of beer, wine and hand-rolling
tobacco are unaffected, the duty on a
5% ABV pint of beer in Britain
remains a massive 30.7p compared
to 4.4p in France. While you're in
Calais, you might want to pick up
some cigarettes, small cigars or pipe
tobacco; the duty on these has risen
by 3% above inflation, equivalent to
15p on a packet of 20.
If this weren't enough to drive the
nation to drink, Mr Clarke punished
trendy or lightweight socialites by
raising the duty on so-called
'alcopops' by 40%, equivalent to 8p
on a small bottle, but pandered to
hard-drinkers by cutting 4% off duty
on spirits. This is equivalent to 26p
on a 70cl bottle of whisky.
THE PRIVATE FINANCE
INITIATIVE
The PFI is a means by which the
Government hopes to improve the
efficiency of public services by using
private companies to fulfil contracts
usually undertaken by public agen-
cies. So far the PFI has funded large-
scale public-sector projects, for
example the construction of new
public buildings such as hospitals.
The Chancellor reaffirmed the
Government's commitment to PFI
by cutting direct public spending
from £19.7bn to £18bn this year, and
by a further £0.3bn to £17.7bn by the
years 1999/2000.
This shortfall in public expendi-
ture is expected to be more than com-
pensated for by increases in funding
for the private-sector, set torisefrom
£l.lbn to a projected £2.5bn this
year, and reaching £4.3bn by the end
of this century.
As a result of this policy, construc-
tion projects at universities will be
HIGHER EDUCATION
This weeks' Budget the focus of
many campaigns by groups sympa-
thetic to the plight of Higher
Education in Britain. These groups,
particularly student bodies such as
the NUS, the Committee of Vice
Chancellors and Principles, and the
employee bodies such as the
Association of University Teachers
sought to influence the Chancellor,
Kenneth Clarke, and his Treasury
mandarins to increase spending on
this important sector and not ignore
or reduce its funding as in previous
Budgets.
They attempted to do this by a
variety of means, through lobbying
Members of Parliament, presenting
detailed reports to inquiries such as

finally resorting to direct action to air
their grievances, as the strike by
Higher Education employees two
weeks ago demonstrated. It is debat-
able whether all their efforts have
had the desired effect.
The AUT were quick to claim that
the campaign had succeed in damage
limitation, citing the 0.5% decrease
of expenditure per student in real
terms as providing a 'breathing
space' compared to the expected cut
of 3% per student. Not really much
of an advance for HE!

by private companies. The BMS pro-
ject, due for completion in 1997, has
been funded jointly by the College,
the NHS and drugs companies.

And for those of you looking for a
job this Christmas... the forecast is
good. Unemployment is coming
down, and the demand for graduates
for top positions is higher than it has
been since the eighties. Judging by
the demand for graduate recruitment
advertising space in Felix, Imperial
College graduates are highly rated.
The drop in the basic rate of
income tax will benefit employers
and new employees alike; the take
home pay for graduate trainees will
be greater and the cost of employing
staff will effectively be less.
However, with 18-25 the greatest
consumers of 'luxuries' like beer and
cigarettes, it may just go straight out
of your pocket again...
