Eric Forth, Tory MP: outcome of election "deliriously uncertain"
KELLY ROBINSON
For a discussion which one might
have thought would be concerned
largely with higher education, the
talk by Eric Forth MP was decidedly
comprehensive. In fact, during his
introduction he admitted that, as a
former Minister for Higher Edu-
cation, he had already heard himself
speak enough about Universities.
Instead, Mr Forth proceeded to give
an overview of British politics today,
or at least his own views.
He began by tackling the question
of how Bill Clinton had succeeded in
winning a second term in office by
persuading the American public that
their country was on the economic
"up and up", and that they should
vote for him to express their grati-
tude. The Conservative Minister sug-
gested that his party's failure to
achieve the same feat could be attrib-
uted to the British sense of fair play,
claiming that the electorate was turn-
ing to Labour out of a misplaced
desire to "give them a chance".
Mr Forth's diatribe on Labour's
policies, or lack thereof, continued as
he went on to mention their infa-
mous u-turns on issues such as uni-
lateral disarmament, public owner-
ship, and tax brackets. He said
Labour had seen the error of their
ways, and had decided to adopt the
vote-winning policies of the Con-
servatives, leaving the British public
extremely confused with "no clear
blue water" between the parties.
In the past, Mr Forth explained, the
Labour Party had fought the corner
of the oppressed while the
Conservatives guarded the interests
of rich, 'fat-cat' businessmen. Now
that the mood of the Conservative
party is comparatively left-wing and
the collective mood of New Labour
can only be said to swing ever further
to the right, he emphasised the diffi-
culty the Conservatives have encoun-
tered in establishing a difference
between the two. Global politics, he
claimed, is "heading in the right
direction, in both senses of the word"
and while Tony Blair had somer-
saulted onto the bandwagon, the
remainder of his Party still lagged
behind.
The Minister, who by his own
admission is happy for the Party to
move as far to therightas possible, is
a Thatcherite of the highest degree.
The economic growth and stability
he believes we are presently experi-
encing is, he said, an obvious conse-
quence of the wise policies enforced
during Margaret Thatcher's rule.
Forty percent of inward investment
in Europe is directed towards Britain,
demonstrating our commercial desir-
ability in relation to the rest of the
continent. Whether or not this is truly
attributable to the 'Iron Lady' was
left to the individuals present to
decide.
One of the few differences the
minister could pinpoint between the
Conservatives and Labour was on the
issue of European union. As a former
MEP, Mr Forth expressed his opin-
ion that the European Parliament was
a "damp squib", a view apparently
shared to a greater or lesser extent by
the rest of his party. Labour, he
claimed, found the whole idea much
more romantic, but he questioned
how long such a honeymoon would
last given previous experience.
Mr Eric Forth refused to be drawn
into making a prediction about the
result of a General Election, insisting
instead that whichever way the pub-
lic swings, the numbers would not be
as clear-cut as some opinion polls
suggest. Speaking coyly of what the
overall outcome of such an election
might be, Mr Forth employed the
carefully-chosen words "deliciously
uncertain".
After his speech, Mr Forth fielded
the inevitable questions from an
audience consisting largely of IC
Conservative Society members. The
MP responded positively to the ques-
tion of how he dealt with the pre-
dominantly Labour led NUS. Each
trade union or lobby group should be
treated to its own merits, he said, and
if a request is made of the
Government the group's exact nature
should be specified during any meet-
ing which takes place.
Mr Forth suggested that the cur-
rent political apathy amongst stu-
dents might be why such a low pro-
portion of NUS representatives are
Conservatives. Recalling the radical
student politics of the past, he went
so far as to say that had he visited IC
a few years ago he would have con-
sidered himself lucky to leave with
his clothes on! Finally, Mr Forth
expressed his hopes that the anti-
Conservative lobby; conspicuous by
their absence, must be busy studying
in order to achieve the qualifications
which would justify their applica-
tions for student loans.
