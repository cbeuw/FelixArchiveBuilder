FELIX FRIDAY 2QTH N O V E M B E R COLUMNS & THE WEEKLY POEM 11
Tabloid Journalists. It is generally
felt that such wordsmiths are not the
most wholesome characters, being
categorised neatly between traffic
wardens and Paul Daniels. They
pounce on a story with scant atten-
tion to the facts. Wouldn't happen
here, would it. Ah, well yes and no.
You may recall, and it seems half
of Sherfield do, my mention of dubi-
ous work practices in the Student
Fees Office, where check-mate takes
priority over cheques, mate.
Unfortunately, there isn't a Student
Fees Office, but there is a Student
Finance Office, which contains,
among others, the perfectly named
but unrelated Shirley Baker. She was
understandably anxious about this
ambiguity, so let me apologise pro-
fusely and clarify the issue. The
College Expenses Office (room 410)
was the place to which I was refer-
ring, and I stand by the thrust of my
point. Such behaviour is unaccept-
able and should be dealt with accord-
ingly. Why chess is needed on
Sherfield's computers is a fascinat-
ing question, one which will hopeful-
ly be answered in due course. The
Student Finance Office is totally
blameless, has never committed any
misdemeanour to my knowledge,
and is staffed by Imperial'sfinest.If
you see me begging in South Ken
subway at the
time of the next
grant cheque,
you will know that
this apology has
not been accepted.
Speaking of
Sherfield, I noticed
that my esteemed
but sadly anony-
mous brother in
arms Don, writing
in the house jour-
nal IC Distorter,
mentioned the

Reason
if like those in neighbouring
Chemistry, never leaked, have been
totally resealed, and the stonework
has been both cleaned and stained in
an operation that has cost thousands.
Although the money, I believe, was
from an external source, surely it
could have been used a little more
sensibly. But given the signs debacle,
this is more sensible. As for Campus
Renaissance, I'll freely admit that
things are going
very well, with
the BMS rising
majestically. Keep
it up, the effort
that is, and the
building of course.
As predicted the
strike took place
across the country
a week last
Tuesday. My sym-
pathies go out to
those brave souls
on the picket line
who must have
frozen to death,
but I did feel
s o m e w h a t
doubtful about the strike, hence my
reason for breaking it. No one can
sensibly argue that academics are
adequately paid, particularly when
one sees an advert in the Evening
offering £20,000. The reasons for the
relative diminution of their pay is a
complex economic issue, but the
overwhelming fact is that groups do
not curry favour with a Conservative
government by taking industrial
action. Nor does Joe Public feel com-
pelled to speak out in support when
the affected group is one of the least
liked in society, namely students.
However, on the assumption that all
universities are, like IC, run accord-
ing to the teachings of the British
Leyland School of Management, it
should be possible to free up
resources to fund a larger pay claim
for this deserving group. Finally,
many people think that I am a tad
unfair about the beer in Da Vinci's
and the Union Bar, comparing it very
unfavourably with 'the other place.'
So last Friday, I decided to check this
out once and for all. Some very
extensive research was undertaken,
and I can confirm that the
Worthingtons, Brakespear and
Tetley should not be consumed under
any circumstances. You have been
warned.
Standard for council handypersons
The NHS has been experiencing
many problems of late, culminating
with this month's budget deficits. I
was surprised at how this was report-
ed in the media. A patient was left
out on the road for six hours waiting
for treatment, as there were no doc-
tors available to treat them. The NHS
obviously does not have enough
money to handle all patients. The
ignorance here which is constantly
presented on national as well as
regional news is that we somehow
do not pay for our health service.
The Government initiatives of
decentralisation, (cutting costs of
patient care), care in the community,

money. People may want to take out
private medical insurance, but con-
sidering how much it costs, wouldn't
it be better if our taxes paid for a bet-
ter NHSfor everybody, not just those
who can pay? I am all for value for
money, but only if initiatives are
managed well and the Government
on its present track record appears to
be unable to achieve this.
Basic Bupa cover costs £108 a
year. For an average earner of!
£15000, this is equivalent to almost;
an extra penny on the basic rate of
income tax. The effect of spending)
this is obviously less for those who
are richer, effectively creating a two
tier health service. When an article

weak ideology. All the Government
initiatives so far have been in order
to save money - our money. This is
fair enough. The problem comes
when, on reduction of a hospitals
budget, you expect them to find sav-
ings that will match this. Some
enlightened hospitals will get the
management consultants in, but
inevitably you will experience either
a drop in the quality of patient care or
an overspend. John Major has agreed
that the NHS will need half a billion
next year to balance its books. We
may well be paying less for our
NHS, but we shouldn't expect to
receive the same service for our
NHS in a bad light,
it is presented that
they do not have enough money, not
that the Government - and therefore
us - are underfunding it.
When you next hear how NHS
cuts caused so-and-so, think about
who finally pays the bill for it. The
election is coming, and once again
the Tories will offer lower taxes
This is all they can offer - they have
no moral high ground or good man
agement. When crime rises, insur-
ance goes up. When hospital stan-
dards drop, people are forced to get
private health care. Think how much
extra you are really paying.

The Weekly Poem
Why now?
Reality is too much for me
I hear myself say
then and now, every day
I flee from life
and hide myself
inside the lies
of my mind's domain -
am I insane?
What is sanity but
the majority's conformist view?
What is reality but
a facade to hide the true
mundane train we ride?
What is life but a moment of pain?
What's the point the ironic aim?
'To enjoy yourself some might say,
'to go with the flow, play the game' -
well I don't want each day
to be some cheap B movie
that rolls the credits and then leaps
through the rain for a passing taxi;
I don't care for casual laughter
echoing from human disaster
at every nightspot's comer;
I don't want it safer brigher longer warmer:
I've seen the future flashes of this endless fire
and the bitter satire of a lifetime's ashes.
