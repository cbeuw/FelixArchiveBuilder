There must be quite a few of you
who must have a few different
questions about how sports facilities
will be safer at Imperial this year.
Therefore, we have done some research
and spoken to some people at Move
Imperial so that we can answer some of
them below.
With COVID restrictions limiting
how many people can fit into once
roomy areas, we here at Felix Sport have
found out what exercising at Imperial is
going to look like in the time of corona.
Imperial has opened 3 facilities
currently this year: Ethos (Imperial’s
main gym located near Princes
Gardens), Harlington (sports pitches
near Heathrow), and the Boathouse
(located in Putney). The staff have
worked to ensure the facilities can be
opened safely and to also still ensure the
best student experience. For this, some
new measures have come into play.
Firstly, all memberships must be
done prior to entering the facilities.
Gym membership is £30 a year and
membership for sports hall and pool is
free!
Bookings are mandatory for
everything at Ethos: gym sessions,
classes, access to the pool, anything you
can think of. This is in line with a fair
usage policy: 2 bookings a day with a
maximum of 7 bookings over the course
of 6 days, and you can only book events
6 days in advance. All activities will be
done in blocks of 45 min so that there
is a 15min period of deep cleaning that
the staff can do before the next block.
They have also reduced capacity to
35%. Sadly, the sauna, steam room, and
rock-climbing wall will be closed due
to social distancing. The gym has also
limited equipment and boxed off areas
to ensure 2 meters of social distancing.
Finally, some of the smaller rules and
regulationsputintoplace:therewon’tbe
access to dry changing rooms, showers,
and lockers, there are designated one-
way areas, and hanging out outside in
large groups is not allowed.
Move Imperial has also expanded
its platform to adjust for people who
won’t be able to go to a gym. They
have started and will continue to have
some online exercise classes on their
Instagram, which they started almost at
the beginning of quarantine by posting
videos of exercises, stretches, recipes,
and general advice for athletes.
