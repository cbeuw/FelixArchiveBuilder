Welcome back. It is
with great joy and re-
lief that I bring you
Felix issue 1749,
the first of our post
lockdown issues.
Felix as a paper has
been in print con-
sistently since its in-
ception in 1949. This
hiatus, stretching 28 weeks
since last year’s final issue has been
the longest period in our history that
Felix has not been in print. With this
issue, we put that behind us and look
to the future.
We return to you much stronger
than when we left. Our team is the
largest that it has been for 4 years
and has been overcoming difficulty
to continue producing articles from
home by remote desktoping into the
office to layout pages for print. I have
pushed the team hard and I would
like to thank them very much for the
work they have done. I hope they felt
it was worth it and that that they are
proud of what they have produced. I
am certainly proud of them. Special
mention goes to the Science section
that has recruited over 60 writers and
interviewed the prize-winning Im-
perial mathematician Professor Sir
Martin Hairer. It is well worth a read.
Keen readers may have
spotted our new layout.
We hope you like it and
that it will stand the test
of time. Those unhap-
py with the change are
welcome to complain to

go to Isabelle Zhang for her
tireless work getting it ready. Fe-
lix wouldn’t happen without you.
The collected articles published on
our interim website felixonlinesum-
mer.uk will be gathered into a single
issue, 1748 as a record of the way that
Felix continued publication through-
out adversity and will be displayed on
our new online home at Felixonline.
co.uk. This website has also been the
product of work over the summer re-
placing its worn-out predecessor and
it will once again make the archives
andbackissuesfullysearchable.Many
thankstoAndyWangandPeteBridg-
manfortheirworkonthis.Ihopeyou
will agree with me that it is infinitely
nicer than what came before.
Thanks for reading.

The long hiatus, now
thankfully over
The Felix Editor on
Keep the Cat Free
While masquerading under a mot-
to of “Keep the Cat Free” I write to
you, our readers, with an apology.
This week, we have been forced to
withdraw certain aspects of one of
our stories as they identified staff
members who on the basis of our alle-
gations, could use the contents of the
article as a basis for an employment
tribunal against the Union.
We concede that with Union fi-
nances being so threadbare, initiat-
ing a round of court appearances and
legal confrontations would not be in
the interests of the student body.
However, I would like to assure
you that our zeal to print uncomfort-
able truths remains. If you feel that
students or staff are being mistreated
and would like to bring this to the at-
tention of the Felix team contact Fe-
lix@ic.ac.uk. All conversations will
be off the record until explicitly said
otherwise.

Statement
of Intent
We here at Felix believe that it is al-
ways in the interests of the students to
know. That cover-up and paternalistic
obfuscation is never right and that
as intelligent people students should
be treated with respect and given the
ability to make up their own minds.
Therefore, I, the Felix Editor, on be-
half of the team promise that:
We will to the best of our abil-
ity tell you the whole truth and
nothing but the truth.
We will keep your confidence
and will only publish something
you say to us if you have explicitly
said that we can.
We will work to expose unfair-
ness and discrimination in all
forms that it takes both at the
College and elsewhere.
We will treat fairly any article
sent to us, regardless of point
of view and do our best to work
with you to prepare it for publi-
cation it in our pages.
