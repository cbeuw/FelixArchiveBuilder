Collective of Imperial Student complain at not be-
ing able to ‘show off’ during pre-recorded online
lectures
A small group of Imperial students have called for
a return to in-person live lectures rather than the new
COVID friendly, pre recorded lectures. It is under-
stood the motivation behind the campaign is due to
thenewlectureformatofferingscarceopportunityfor
these students to demonstrate their superiority over
their peers. In its most basic case this is attempting to
correct a lecturer, however it can also take the form of
asking drawn out, self-answering questions during the
lecture.
Academic representatives across all departments
have been inundated with angry, perfectly word-
ed emails about this issue. NegaFelix reached out to
Crarchie Awford, the third year physicist behind the
campaign. I asked him “You’ve started this campaign
because you have less opportunities to question lec-
turers, tell me more about that”, showing an unchar-
acteristic flicker of emotion he smirked and remind-
ed me that it should be “fewer opportunities”. After
refusing to answer my question until I rephrased, he
elaborated; “It’s simply something the College hasn’t
considered when making the decision to host online
lectures, I need to get my self-approval from some-
where and there’s only so much winning the fam-
ily zoom quiz will do for me”. I suggested that if he
wantedtoaskthelecturesquestionswhydidn’thejust
email them, he retorted “If a tree falls in the forrest
and no one is around the hear it, did it really make
a sound? Yeah, didn’t think so”. NegaFelix contacted
Imperial College Union for comment, they declined.
