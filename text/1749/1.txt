Anonymous sources in the Union have revealed
that a culture of over-work and callous manage-
ment led to a student being served a pint that con-
tained bleach, not cleared out after the line cleaning
that had occurred the previous day and that non ha-
lal burgers were served as halal to freshers and their
families for the whole day as new students moved into
halls.
The two incidents occurred in 2018 in the Union
bar and in 568 respectively, however, in neither case
were the students or customers informed of what they
had just eaten or drunk. Nor were procedures altered
to prevent this happening again.
The contaminated pint was served after a perma-
nent staff member failed to complete the line cleaning
process the night before.
The issue however, has been described as an “acci-
dent waiting to happen” by student bar staff members
who expressed frustration at chronic understaffing
leading to a lack of permanent bar staff supervisors
who were supposed to do line cleaning and the intro-
duction of Union breakfasts which made it impossi-
ble for essential maintenance to be carried out in the
