In order to put an end to the glob-
al coronavirus pandemic, research-
ers around the world are working
tirelessly to develop a vaccine to
protect against COVID-19. While
vaccine production usually takes
multiple years, a coronavirus vaccine
is hoped to be developed within 12-
18 months.
Vaccine testing can be split into 5
stages:
Pre-clinical – animal testing to see
whether the vaccine elicits an im-
mune response.
Phase I – healthy human volunteers
to determine safety and evaluate im-
mune response.
Phase II – hundreds of volunteers to
identify correct dosage.
Phase III – thousands of volunteers
to confirm safety and efficacy vs. a
placebo.
Phase IV – studies on adverse ef-
fects, long-term mmunity and vac-
cine usage following the approval
and licensing of the vaccine.
The WHO is currently tracking the
progress of over 170 candidate vac-
cines; at Felix, we’ve chosen 5 of the
most promising candidates to follow,
so watch this space!
Procrastination: more prominent
now than ever, as everyone adjusts
to studying and working from home -
but what exactly is it? Experts define it
as the voluntary delay of an important
task - usually to focus on more short-
term, satisfying activities - despite
knowing that we’ll suffer as a result.
Studies find that around 20% of the
population are chronic procrastinators.
Unfortunately, while some claim that
it sparks creativity, research shows that
people who procrastinate have higher
levels of stress and lower wellbeing.
So why do we still do it? A common
explanation is poor time management.
While that is a contributing factor, true
procrastination is a failure of self-reg-
ulation, with the inability to manage
emotions at its very foundation. Pro-
crastinators recognise the temporal
harm in their actions, but can’t over-
come the emotional urges towards dis-
tractions resulting in feelings of guilt
and anxiety. Being in a negative mood
then hampers your ability to perform,
restarting the cycle.
Reasonsforthisvary,butthereareafew
key procrastinator types. Thrill-seek-
ers like the adrenaline rush once the
deadline rolls around. The last-minute
pressure is the only thing that actually
motivates them – and, chances are, they
have a history of getting away with it.
The fearful are afraid of being judged
for their inadequate performance and
would prefer to be regarded as lacking
effort, rather than ability. Perfection-
ists want an ideal final product, and so
think that there will be a ‘better’ mo-
ment, as their future self will be more
knowledgeableorprepared.Othersmay
get overwhelmed
by the number and
complexity of sub-
tasks required, de-
laying the entirety
of the task.
Psychological-
ly, a phenomenon
called tempo-
ral discounting
or present bias
may be to blame.
This means that a
stronger weight is
given to payoffs that are closer to the
present, even if the value of something
presently and far away is the same. Pro-
crastinators enjoy instant gratification,
while the future self seems like a dif-
ferent person. For example, studying
for a Friday test for 1 hour daily is less
preferable to studying many hours on
Thursday night because alternative op-
tions such as socialising with friends are
more fun at the time.
Neurobiologically, procrastination
is a battle between two brain regions:
the limbic system and the prefrontal
cortex. The limbic system contains the
pleasure centre, controls mood, instinct
and reward, and functions automatical-
ly. When you attempt to do something
painful or stressful, the limbic system
will urge you to stay away in order to
provide immediate relief (for example,
taking your hand
away from a flame).
The prefrontal
cortex controls
integrating in-
formation, plan-
ning, and deci-
sion making, but
has to be actively
forced to work.
Since the latter
isn’t as devel-
oped, the limbic
system frequent-
ly wins, leading to procrastination - un-
til the prefrontal cortex, realising that
the task is urgent, eventually forces you
to take action. Additionally, every time
something pleasurable is done, dopa-
mine is released, strengthening neuron
connections and reinforcing positive
associations with that behaviour for the
future.
The stressful feelings accompanying
procrastination can be linked to the
amygdala - a brain region associated
with automatic emotional reactions
and the ‘fight or flight’ response against
challenging tasks. When activated, the
brain protects against possible difficul-
ties, releasing adrenaline, in turn in-
creasing levels of fear and anxiety. Inter-
estingly, research has found that those
who chronically procrastinate often
have a larger amygdala than those who
don’t.
Sinceprocrastinationisharmful–how
can you minimise it? Breaking up tasks
into smaller chunks, and simply begin-
ning, even if only for 5 minutes, will
help you get started. Set yourself inter-
nal deadlines, remove temptations, for
example by using app/website blockers,
and reward yourself with a 10-15-min-
ute break for every 45 minutes. Finally,
studies show that the best treatment is
targeting the emotions: when you find
something positive about the task it-
self, it will encode a positive association
in your brain. Remember the amazing
feeling of managing to complete some-
thing prior to the deadline, and, most
importantly, forgive yourself if it does
happen, so that you can start fresh next
time. And if someone complains about
your tendencies to leave work till the
last minute (cough cough your par-
ents), you’re not ‘just lazy’ – it’s a scien-
tifically-legitimate condition!
