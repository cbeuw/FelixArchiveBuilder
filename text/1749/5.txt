Union president Abhijay Sood has
apologised for how student staff
were treated in the past saying, “We
apologise and want to stress that we
have learnt valuable lessons from this
period”.
Sood acknowledged the frustration
that was felt by bar staff members and
has initiated a consultation on Union
staffing and reorganisation. One of
the key aims of this consultation is to
give the staff an hourly pay rate the
reflects the London Living Wage, a
key manifesto point of Abhijay Sood’s
Union President re-election cam-
paign.
While he stated that COVID re-
strictions make definite plans diffi-
cult he has said that he regretted “the
loss of confidence and drop in satis-
faction amongst students and student
staff” and acknowledged the need to
“change dramatically in every single
area that we operate, including with-
in our leadership and management
teams”.
Other staff members have echoed
this Union attitude paradigm shift,
saying that they would work shifts
down in the bar, in order to get a bet-
ter understanding of conditions for
student staff workers.
Sood also recognised that there
has been a disconnect in previous
years between the service provided
by the Union and what students actu-
ally want saying that they are looking
to adopt a “strategy that better aligns
them with what students want”
The staffing consultation can be
completed and more details can be

Union apologises for staff treatment
Calum Drysdale Editor in Chief THE ORIGINAL STATEMENT
During the 2019/20
academic year it is ob-
vious that the Union
faced a number of sig-
nificant challenges
within our own oper-
ation, most notably
within our bars and
kitchen functions. This
clearly resulted in a loss
of confidence and drop
in satisfaction amongst
students and student
staff alike. Whilst we
cannot comment on
specific staffing mat-
ters, we completely
accept that we did not
deliver a service that
Imperial College stu-
dents deserve. We apol-
ogise and want to stress
that we have learned
important lessons from
this period.
The COVID-19
pandemic has required
the Union to change
dramatically in every
single area that we op-
erate, including with-
in our leadership and
management teams.
Due to social distanc-
ing rules, the only ven-
ue we are able to oper-
ate for the foreseeable
future is 568 under an
entirely different op-
erating model. This
context has therefore
required the Union to
make significant altera-
tions to our permanent
staffing team. The con-
sultation process for
this has now been com-
pleted, and some fur-
ther details can be seen
here:www.imperialcol-
legeunion.org/news/
union-staffing-consul-
tation-and-reorganisa-
tion.
Over the next six
monthsweareplanning
a strategic review of the
entire Union, as we
seek to become a better
run and more effective
organisation. Our plan
is to positively rebuild
our commercial out-
lets once the pandemic
has eased – but based
on a new strategy that
better aligns them with
what students want. A
major element of this
work will of course be
how we deliver a bet-
ter service, but we also
plan to look at how we
maximise the opportu-
nities available to stu-
dent staff. We are com-
mitted to becoming a
Union that trusts stu-
dents to help us run our
barsandourshops,and
ensures as much money
as possible is put back
into the pockets of our
members.
We will be consult-
ing heavily with stu-
dents (and student
staff) over the coming
months and are excited
to start the process of
our long term transfor-
mation.
This statement and other comments
coming from the Union point to-
wards a real change in attitude occur-
ring. Union officials are reportedly
frustrated by the disconnect between
student staff and the collapsing moral
of the workforce. Already there are
positive signs of change in the air.
Casual bar staff were kept on the
furlough scheme over the summer in
what is an encouraging gesture given
the difficult financial situation of the
Union. We here at Felix hope that
this is not a flash in the pan and that
the conditions of bar staff will con-
tinue to improve into the future.
EDITORIAL
Casual staff were discouraged from
drinking in Union bars as a further an-
ti-theft policy with staff parties being
treated with suspicion and hostility.
Managers hired security to watch par-
ties and would themselves loiter nearby,
watching over proceedings, contribut-
ing to the culture of intimidation.
Unfortunately for many staff, there
was no possibility of leaving. A former
student manager told Felix that for
many EU students the bar is the only
way that they can get through universi-
ty. While qualifying for Home Student
tuition fees they are not eligible for
maintenance loans or support. There-
fore, unless they can be entirely parent
supported, these students must find
work in order to eat. Felix has heard of
two students in the last two years that
failed their exams while working over
30 hours a week in the bar and of many
more people that struggled to learn
while working 40+ hours a week with
requests for Departmental assistance
being met by an attitude of “if you are
too poor you shouldn’t be here”.
Student bar staff are still not paid
London Living Wage.
