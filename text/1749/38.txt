Brave New World
By Aldous Huxley
You’re cute, quirky, warm, and you always have a
special place in your heart for all the good things
in the world. I assure you, this book is one that
will bring a smile to your face and take away a
little stress of settling at a new place.
Let me take a guess… are you a pragmatic, am-
bitious fresher ready to forge a path of your own
here in Imperial? You’ve come to the right place.
Here’s a book recommendation for you to make
some new habits, break some old ones, and add a
little oomf to your productivity toolbox.
Dear reader, I sense that you’re witty, logical,
intellectual, and unique – I present to you this
classic dystopian novel. I challenge you to think
critically about this world, to read, to think, to not
get lost in the world as you step into your first year
of university.
