One of the many ill-effects of the
current pandemic has been its
impact on international travel, and
few countries have been more affect-
ed than China. Due a complex mix
of governmental policy, international
politics and pandemic measures, the
number of flights between the UK
and China has been far lower than
usual.
For the thousands of Imperial
students and offer holders living in
China, this means being effectively
stranded in their home country for
the start of the academic year. Prices
for flights to London are often prohib-
itively high, and availability is scarce.
What’s more bookings are often can-
celled at short notice, resulting in
enormous financial uncertainty. One
PhD student in the Civil Engineering
department recalled how he spent
“more than £6000 on tickets” while
still not having a confirmed flight
home. Such cases are not unique ei-
ther, says the Graduate Student Un-
ion (GSU) president Zixiao Wang.
According to a GSU survey of 1328
new and current Imperial students in
China, 98% hope for the College to
arrange private charter flights from
various cities back to London. Such a
solution wouldn’t
be without prec-
edent. Recently
Queen’s Univer-
sity Belfast, Ex-
eter University,
and others have
confirmed sim-
ilar plans to get
students back to
the UK in time for the start of term,
highlighting the national scale of the
problem: there are currently over
120,000 Chinese students studying in
the UK, many of whom will be facing
this issue directly.
The uncertainty of the situation is
a massive cause for concern for Mr.
Wang. “I think the impact is very sig-
nificant. There are more than 2000
students at Imperial in China facing
this problem. What I want to empha-
sise is that this isn’t just 2000 students,
but 2000 families”. He says the impact
will be felt not just practically (re-
searchers face “disaster” without ac-
cess to their labs),
but also in terms
of the value fami-
lies feel that they’re
getting: “they’re
paying to study in
London”.
In view of the
national scale of
the problem, the
GSU has called on the College to
“take a leading role” in its alleviation.
In response to Felix’s request for com-
ment, an Imperial College London
spokesperson said: “We know some
of our international students are fac-
ing difficulties getting to Imperial for
the start of term […] and we are do-
ing all we can to support them. We
continue to make the case for more
flights to airlines and are exploring
various options to help our students
experiencing this problem. We will
update affected students as soon as
we can.”
They went on to say that a “wide
range of innovative educational ex-
periences such as virtual labs and
field trips” will be used to mitigate
the potential harm, specifically citing
the use of VR for radiology training
in the medical school, and reassured
students that “our global student
community is part of what makes
studying at Imperial such a rich ex-
perience. International students will
continue to receive a warm welcome
by Imperial wherever in the world
they are studying - remotely or in
person.” For many however, these re-
assurances may not be enough.
GSU lobbies College to bring

Imperial top for graduate prospects says The Times
Publication of the Times Good
University Guide 2021 has seen
Imperial top the national league tables
for graduate prospects with more than
95% of graduates in high skilled em-
ployment or post graduate study 15
months within 15 months of gradua-
tion. It also led amongst leading uni-
versities on its spending on services and
facilities.
In the overall rankings however,
Imperial performed less well, slipping
down a place in the from 4th to 5th be-
hind Cambridge, Oxford, St Andrews
and LSE which moved up two places
from last year to displace Imperial. The
fall in Imperial’s position reverses the
gain made between 2019 and 2020.
These rankings were determined
using 8 metrics (entry standards, stu-
dent-staff ratios, student satisfaction,
servicesandfacilitiesspend,completion
rates, first-class and 2:1 degrees, gradu-
ate prospects and research quality) with
student satisfaction and research quali-
ty being weighted at 1.5.
The main drivers of Imperial’s fall in
position were poor teaching quality,
completion rate and the student-staff
ratio that put it below LSE, despite out-
performing the other London universi-
ty in a number of other fields and com-
ing second in the country for research
quality.
While the top of the leader board was
fairly static there was significant move-
ment further down with Durham (6th),
Lancaster (=10th) and Loughborough
(7th) falling and Bath (9th), UCL (8th)
and Bristol (13th) rising up the table.
The guide also highlighted major is-
sues with Imperial teaching quality that
it ranked as 117th in the country as
well as social inclusion where it ranked
112th with a black attainment gap of
-7% beating only Cambridge, Dur-
ham, Oxford and Bristol. The Guide
acknowledges, however, that outreach
and access programs are having a posi-
tive effect.
Oxford was named as the University
of the year for the work by the Univer-
sity’s first female vice chancellor in ad-
mitting students that had been down-
graded by the government’s results
algorithm and its work on the COV-
ID-19 vaccine.
