Lifestyle changes are practical
steps we can take to feel like we
are having less of an environmental im-
pact, empower us to advocate for the
earth and remove some guilt from con-
sumption. But we cannot solve major
global crises via these changes alone.
Even if we all made these individual
changes to our behaviour, it would not
be enough to prevent ecological col-
lapse nor prevent climate breakdown.
Personal change cannot be the only aim
or end goal. Furthermore, not all of us
will not make these individual chang-
es as we are increasingly disconnected
from the natural processes that make
life possible. It is hard in a city like
London to make time and space to be
in nature; however, cultivating this re-
lationship and respect for the processes
that make life possible, is integral to our
behaviour change.
It is not possible to work towards
a more sustainable earth whilst there
is still widespread global inequality
in terms of GDP and consumption
of resources. The current functioning
of international economics is driving
climate and ecological breakdown
through overconsumption, which is
having a disproportionately greater
negative effect on the Global South,
perpetuating global inequality and
financial instability. Our production
system is cannibalistic, designed to
maximise profits for capital holders
without considering the externali-
ties of such production. Our need for
constant economic growth to prevent
recession will never alleviate poverty
but instead sustain unequal wealth
distribution.
Income inequality has social re-
percussions alongside environmental
impacts as a result of higher income
and affluence creating overconsump-
tion.
So, those with the power of afflu-
ence do have the responsibility to
make better decisions when purchas-
ing goods and services. Responsibili-
ty not only lies with the consumer but
also with corporations extracting and
producing resources and their regula-
tory systems. According to data from
the Carbon Majors Report in 2017,
more than 70% of greenhouse gas
emissions are produced by just 100
companies, highlighting the respon-
sibility of corporations and investors
in tackling climate change and reduc-
ing emissions.
Producing zero emissions
of greenhouse gases is not
compatible with econom-
ic growth as growth creates
demand for energy which
makes it harder to cover
such demand with renew-
able resources. Our econo-
my must grow by 3% each
year to avoid a recession,
so it doubles in size every
20 years. According a paper
co-published by the Centre
of Environmental Systems
Research, this growth has direct ef-
fects on global resource use so that by
2050 our material consumption will
be 260% over the safe limit (we are
currently 60% over limit).
Furthermore, even with the op-
timistic assumptions of rapid tech-
nological innovation and taxes on
resource extraction, our global con-
sumption of resources will still be
164% over the safe limit by 2050.
Technological advances are not out-
running increases in consumption
worldwide. So, it is not enough to
just ‘green’ our consumption by im-
plementing more efficient technolo-
gy we must also reduce consumption
dramatically in the Global North.
The IPCC (Intergovernmental Pan-
el on Climate Change) proposes the
scaling down of material throughput
and resource use. This type of post-
growth economic shift would involve
prioritising wellbeing and ecological
stability over GDP growth. Countries
in the Global North, such as the UK,
have a greater responsibility to re-
duce their environmental impact by
reducing resource use and energy use
so that renewable energy can cover
demand.
Constant economic growth is one
of the most hegemonic ideas in our
current society, and it is causing glob-
al ecological and climate breakdown.
Individual changes in day-to-day
habits are useful and contribute to
creating consciousness of our impact
of living on earth. Although, to make
real change, a politically significant
number of people must reject GDP
as a measure of the quality of life.
Alongside some lifestyle changes, we
can also:
Individual behaviour change is not enough
FRIDAY 25TH SEPTEMBER 2020
SUSTAINABILITY
-Denounce unjust economic poli-
cies
-Advocate for a post-growth so-
cio-economic transition
-Show solidarity with those most af-
fected by climate change
-Increase our communities’ ecolog-
ical literacy
-Put pressure on Imperial to divest
from fossil fuels
Joining a direct-action group,
such as Divest Imperial and Extinc-
tion Rebellion Imperial, is also a
sustainability tip. It is vital to exam-
ine how we contribute to the current
capitalist system and how we can
de-program ourselves from these
values. Our current mindset of in-
dividualism and growth-at-all-costs
is a manifestation of the one-dimen-
sional rationalist thought created by
a severe lack of connection with na-
ture. Therefore, the climate and eco-
logical crises can also be envisioned
as a spiritual crisis lacking a cos-
movision. We can release ourselves
from these neo-liberal capitalist, de-
structive, extractive values by hav-
ing deeper spiritual practice within
our communities.
