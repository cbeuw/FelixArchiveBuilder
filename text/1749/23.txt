There is no arguing that 2020 has
been a dumpster fire of a year for
pretty much everyone. Of all the horri-
ble things COVID-19 has caused, the-
atres closing may appear quite insignifi-
cant. However, due to the sheer volume
of jobs lost (artists, front of house staff,
backstage crew etc.), the industry has
had to adapt new ways to keep people
engaged with the marvels of live thea-
tre. Therefore, in the six months that
the West End has been shut down, there
have been fantastic attempts at bringing
the theatre into our homes, helping it
become more accessible than ever be-
fore. Very early on during lockdown,
as current productions kept extending
their hiatuses and upcoming produc-
tions kept announcing enormous delays
to their opening dates, various schemes
were announced by major players in
the London theatre scene to help keep
theatre somewhat alive. Perhaps the
two most notable examples to this are
National Theatre’s ‘NT at Home’ pro-
gramme, and Andrew Lloyd Webber’s
‘The Show Must Go On’ scheme.
Both schemes released previously
filmed performances for free on their
YouTube channels
at a specific time
weekly, vaguely em-
ulating the feeling
of being in an au-
dience, sharing the
theatregoing expe-
rience with millions
of others. Brilliant-
ly, for those who
couldn’t make the
initial viewing win-
dow, the recordings
were kept online
for a week, allowing
them to be watched
at one’s pleasure,
allowing for each
production to reach
a global audience that’s as wide as possi-
ble. In fact, according to National The-
atre, over 10 million people engaged
with their scheme, which is roughly
equivalent to 4000 performances across
all the National Theatre venues at full
capacity! ‘NT at Home’ included some
fantastic pro-
ductions such
as the fresh yet
faithful adapta-
tion of Shake-
speare’s ‘Antony
& Cleopatra’
starring Ralph
Fiennes and
Sophie Okone-
do, ‘A Streetcar
Named Desire’
starring the
iconic Gillian
Anderson and
‘Frankenstein’
starring Ben-
edict Cum-
berbatch. ‘The
Show Must Go On’ had a fantastic
selection of Lloyd Webber-composed
musicals such as Jesus Christ Superstar
and ‘Joseph and the Amazing Tech-
nicolor Dreamcoat’. Both schemes
also encouraged donations to support
not only the theatre industry, but also
NHS-related charities.
As lockdown eased and things normal-
ised, other theatres joined in on the
fun, and some with brand new content,
some of which aired live from the stage,
filmed with no audience. For example,
Claire Foy and Matt Smith performed
their acclaimed production of Dun-
can MacMillan’s Lungs on the Old Vic
stage, charging a fee to be allowed into
the remote audience. The audience was
asked to pay between £10 and £65, al-
though each ticket, regardless of the
price, got the audience members the
same view.
With the return of open-air and so-
cially distanced performances, the age
of remote and free theatre has already
slowed down significantly. However, if
airing these shows has got a handful of
young people interested in the perform-
ing arts, I say we should be happy that it
happened, not sad because it’s over.
Throughout my position as an Arts
Editor, I have been a big supporter of
making theatre more accessible, trying
to draw attention to all the different
ways the industry has done this over
the years, and also to the many short-
comings that the theatre industry has
placed upon themselves in this aspect.
Therefore, it has been really interest-
ing to me that all it took to share the
gift of theatre with the whole world,
without asking for extortionate prices
or having to partake in weekly lotteries
with miniscule chances of ever winning
(looking at you, Hamilton) was a pan-
demic. Of course, watching plays from
a computer screen does not emulate
the actual theatregoing experience in a
meaningful way, but given that it’ll be a
while before everything is back to nor-
mal, I’ll take it.
