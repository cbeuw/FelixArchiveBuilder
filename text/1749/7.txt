they’re not even continuous. They’re
extremely irregular.
Felix: Do you make use of a lot of
computation in your work then?
MH: I do use simulations to guide
intuitions, sometimes. If you want to
figure out what some system does you
code it up and see what it actually does
on a computer, and that might give
you hints of what you might be able to
prove mathematically. But I wouldn’t
say it’s a major component of my work.
And of course, I use simulations to help
illustrate my lectures as well.
Felix: Is it fair to say that your work
is quite often dealing with emergent
phenomena?
MH: Yeah, you could say that. In
the physicists’ language, it’s more about
trying to understand the phenomenon
of universality, trying to understand
why there are a lot of different systems
that, when you look at the fluctuations
at very large scales, they actually kind of
look the same. Typically at large scales,
a system doesn’t really depend on the
microscopic details. It’s something that
as a physicist you would take for grant-
ed, but as a mathematician it’s not at all
something that’s obvious. So it goes in
the direction of trying to understand
that phenomenon.
Felix: When researching you I
found out that your father is also a
mathematician! What’s it like having
two mathematicians in the family?
MH: Three, actually! My wife is also
a mathematician, she’s even a professor
at Imperial as well. When we go back
and visit my parents, it’s not like we’re
all just talking about math at the dinner
table or anything at all, it’s just normal
family conversations. I mean, what my
father does in math, isn’t that close to
whatI’mdoing.Wecanstillunderstand
each other and what research the other
is doing, but we’re not really that close
research wise. With my wife, Professor
Xue-Mei Li, we’re a bit closer because
she also works in probability. We ac-
tually have published a joint paper to-
gether. But yeah, we don’t always talk
about math at home.
Felix: Did he play a part in inspir-
ing you to study the same discipline?
MH: Certainly, in the sense that he
would always be willing to answer my
questions and I would ask him what he
was working on. I was always interest-
ed in sciences, and I actually started by
studying physics, I was in the theoreti-
cal physics group in Geneva. But then
I got more and more attracted towards
the mathematical side.
Felix: You did your PhD in physics
as well – how come you switched over
to maths?
MH: Yeah, well I did the PhD for-
mally in the physics department, but it
was really a PhD in math. At any other
university my supervisor would have
been in the math department. I felt I
was just better at math, and I like the
fact that in math, when you prove a the-
orem, it’s true forever.
Felix: You’ve been awarded the
Fields Medal, you’ve been knight-
ed, and now you have also won this
Breakthrough Prize. As someone who
has been awarded so many honours,
what’s your opinion on these honour
systems?
MH: Maybe slightly ambivalent. I’m
obviously extremely happy to have been
awarded, but I get the feeling that there
arecertaintypesofworkthatareeasyto
honour because it’s clear that one per-
son has made the main contribution. So
inthatsense,IgotluckybecauseIdevel-
oped a chunk of theory and it was really
clear to see that the founding paper was
written entirely by
myself, and many
of the later pa-
pers were written
in collaboration
with students, or
postdocs, and so
it was clear that
I founded that
theory. Whereas
what happens in
many cases is you
have math that
gets developed by
several people to-
gether. And there
it’s much less clear
who you would
want to honour -
if there’s five peo-
ple from different
institutions that
all contributed to it in various bits and
pieces, then someone who deserves
to be recognised may miss out. But it
doesn’t mean that the math they pro-
duced is any less impressive. So that’s al-
ways the thing that makes me feel a bit
uneasy about them.
Felix: This interview is for the
fresher’s issue of Felix, and presuma-
bly many maths freshers will be read-
ing this. Is there anything you would
like to say to them?
MH: This year is especially challeng-
ing,becausetheywillhavetofollowlec-
tures from home and there will be very
little interaction with staff. I want to
wish them good luck,
and I hope that this
unusual format
isn’t going to turn
them away from
their studies, and
they can still find
a way to motivate
themselves, even if
there is less social
interaction, which
is of course a very
important part of
university life. So I
can certainly sym-
pathise with them
as they’ve drawn
the short straw
here.
Felix: Final
question – which
mathematician, historic or present,
do you believe should be more recog-
nised?
MH: Well, it always depends on: rec-
ognised by whom? One of the mathe-
maticians I found most impressive is
von Neumann, and he is of course well
known among mathematicians and pre-
sumably you’ve heard about him too.
But everyone knows Einstein, or New-
ton, but very few in the general public
know von Neumann. He certainly de-
serves to be a household name.
