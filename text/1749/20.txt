The lockdown in March has meant
that societies have had to cancel
or postpone the bulk of their in-person
events scheduled for the Summer Term.
Now, in September, as Imperial pre-
pares to welcome a new batch of fresh-
ers, societies have been hard at work to
adapt their activities, ensuring that they
conformtothecurrentgovernmentand
college guidelines. However, given the
collaborative nature of performances
and the vital role audiences play in the
running of performing arts societies,
these societies clearly have their work
cut out for them.
We reached out to the presidents
of four major performing arts socie-
ties - Imperial College Drama Society
(DramSoc), Imperial College Musical
Theatre Society (MTSoc), ICSM Dra-
ma and ICSM Light Opera and asked
them to weigh in on how COVID-19
has affected them so far, and what their
plans were looking ahead at the upcom-
ing academic year.
DISCLAIMER: The information
provided below is based on the current
government and college guidelines as
of the third week of September. As the
COVID-19 situation is rapidly evolv-
ing, it is possible that further chang-
es will have to be made, accounting
for changing guidelines. Please get in
touch with the respective society to get
the most up to date information. Stay
safe and welcome (or welcome back!)
to London.
COVID-19 has affected us all in so
many ways and going forward, this is
going to fundamentally shape life on
campus. Could you tell us a bit on what
a normal year’s schedule would be like
for your society, in terms of produc-
tions and performances, had it not been
for the pandemic?
DramSoc: October Show is general-
ly the first show we put on in the year,
where we have a double-act with MT-
Soc, and put on original plays. Then,
we have a main show in each term,
and these are great ways [for us] to
showcase both our techies’ and actors’
skills. We have had some great plays
in the past like ‘The Resistible Rise of
Arturo Ui’ and ‘And Then There Were
None’. DramSoc gets heavily involved
in events like the Summer Ball, SilFest,
M Night and East Meets West, set-
ting up all the big lights and speakers!
Although hard work, these events are
usually some of the most enjoyable for
the techies. During the
Summer Break, we usu-
allyhaveacoupleofour
actors perform their
own original pieces,
which they thoroughly
enjoy. We’ve had some
good success there too,
with our last show,
Compost, getting great
reviews!
MTSoc: During Autumn Term, fol-
lowing the October show we have our
Revue! This is a compilation of musical
numbers from a range of musicals, all
directed by society members. In Spring
Term, we run our biggest production,
Spring Show. Previous shows have in-
cluded Sweeney Todd, RENT, Legally
Blonde, and Footloose. Since 2019,
we have also run a small-scale Studio
Show alongside Spring Show to accom-
modate for our growing society, with
a smaller cast, and offering more cre-
ative flexibility to the directing team.
We usually end the year with a 24-hour
musical in Summer term. The show is
kept completely secret until 24 hours
before doors open; the cast, band,
and crew then work throughout the
night and day to get everything perfor-
mance-ready! We also host termly cab-
arets where anyone can sign up to sing a
song of their choosing, and in February
we have a Very Vocal Evening, which is
a collaborative night of performances
from MTSoc and A Cappella.
ICSM Drama: We normally put
on 2 large productions which are per-
formed at Union Concert Hall - one in
November (Autumn Play) and one in
March (Main Play). We also perform 3
smaller plays throughout the year. One
Week Play is our preterm play where
cast and crew have one week to rehearse
and learn their lines, Christmas Play
which is performed in early December.
And lastly, Fresher’s Plays at the begin-
ning of first term, which are written by
ourolderyearsandinwhichallFreshers
who audition get a part. Fresher’s Plays
are a brilliant way for new members of
the society to
get to know
each other as
well as older
years. We also
normally have
regular socials
and rehearsals,
and a weekend
away to a se-
cret location at
the end of first term, as well as academic
support, tutorials, and mock exams for
the medical students.
ICSM Light Opera: Light Opera
hosts two shows a year. The first is our
Main Opera production, which is a
musical at the end of the Autumn term.
Thesecondoneisa24-hourproduction
in the summer term which, as its name
suggests, is a full musical which is all
prepared in just 24 hours! We also host
BigChill,anopenmicnightintheRey-
nold’s Bar, which occurs at least once a
term. Throughout the year we also have
regular socials, as well as our Opera
Tour and our fabulous Opera Dinner!
Have you had any productions from
last academic year halted? If so, can we
expect these to be staged this year?
DramSoc: We’ve unfortunately had
to cancel our Summer term main and
our Edinburgh Fringe performances
this year, as well as the October show.
Both Edinburgh Fringe and October
show performances are original plays
that our members’ have written, so we
were really disappointed that we had to
cancel, but we’re hoping that we’ll be
able to put these plays on later in the
year!
MTSoc: Our 2020 studio show,
‘About Last Night’, was unfortunate-
ly cancelled just hours before opening
night due to the lockdown in March.
As a lot of the directing team and cast
have now graduated, it’s unlikely this
will be staged this year. The 2020 24-
Hour Musical and October Show have
also been cancelled.
