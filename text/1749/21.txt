enough to perform all of our pro-
ductions last year, and if you’re lucky
you might be able to find some of our
old ones on the ICSM Drama YouTube
channel.
ICSM Light Opera: Sadly, we had
to postpone last year’s 24-hour pro-
duction as it fell during the lockdown
period. We are looking to stage this
this year, if that is possible!
With the government guidelines
continuously changing, you guys are
probably having to come up with new
contingency plans. What have been
some of the biggest challenges in this
process?
DramSoc: I think it’s been really
hard this year to try and come up with
contingency plans, guidance is con-
stantly changing for us. We’ve effective-
ly had to cancel all in-person shows for
the time being, but we’ve been working
hard on finding alternatives, and we’re
excited for when we’re allowed back on
(and behind) the stage!
MTSoc: Each production requires
months of planning to go ahead, from
the proposal process, to rehearsals, to
show week. Due to the changing guide-
lines and uncertainty surrounding first
term events, we
have faced delays
which has put
us significantly
behind our usual
timeline. The
lack of specif-
ic support for
performing arts
societies and
the severe delay
in information
makes planning
our normal
events and contingency events difficult
at best. While this has been challeng-
ing, the enthusiasm and dedication I’ve
seen from my committee and our soci-
ety members makes the process worth
it, and there’s definitely been a stronger
sense of community between the per-
forming arts societies! I can’t wait to
see what we all achieve this year!
ICSM Drama: We’re all motivated
to find a way to perform and produce
theatre in line with government and
college guidelines, so our main obstacle

will be adapting to last minute changes
in this difficult and unpredictable time.
However, we want to make this an en-
joyable and exciting year for everyone
in the society.
ICSM Light Opera: The biggest
problems we have encountered centre
around how we can carry out our Main
Opera show, and our socials during the
rehearsal term, whilst still adhering to
government guidance. This has been
particularly difficult as the guidance
has been constantly evolving and
things we thought were possible initial-
ly are no longer possible. We’ve also
found problems with how to share our
Big Chill events, although (hopefully)
we can continue with all these events
throughout the year!
And what can you share about the
current plans for this year?
DramSoc: We’ve had to find other
ways to perform. Therefore, we’ve been
planning a radio show to perform this
term, which we’re all quite excited
about! DramSoc has planned more
workshops to be virtual too, including
ones for script development, acting and
techies. We have a whole host of light-
ing and sound desks at our disposal, so
we’ll be running lots of workshops on
how to use them, as well as planning
lots of light shows
on visualisation
software too!
MTSoc: The
committee does
promise to of-
fer performance
opportunities
every term. Over
Summer term in
lockdown, we held
weekly Wednes-
day zoom calls;
an MTSoc online
quiz, filmed a Lockdown Choir video
titled ‘I See Stars’; and held an online
cabaret with our End of Year Awards
ceremony. We are planning to host
another online cabaret this term as
well as other online socials like movie
nights and quizzes. Last year, we debut-
ed MTSoc Families; we hope that this
year, these families can provide some
in-person social activities to welcome
newcomers face-to-face. Furthermore,
while currently not confirmed, we are
still hopeful that Revue 2020 can hap-
MTSoc performing Footloose
WE’VE HAD TO
FIND OTHER WAYS
TO PERFORM,
THEREFORE WE’VE
BEEN PLANNING A
RADIO SHOW
