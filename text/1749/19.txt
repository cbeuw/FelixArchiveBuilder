ers”. The idea, analogous to the ‘Eat Out
to Help Out’ Scheme, suggests the gov-
ernment compensating ticket charges
or matching occupancy rates at theatres
and events. George is
noticeably sceptical
about this. After a
pensive sip of his cof-
fee, he explains why
“The Culture Vouch-
ers, if they went
ahead, would actual-
ly be more beneficial
to workers than other
forms of support (as
the shows are hap-
pening, giving them
work), but I am scep-
tical due to the high cost of tickets, and
that with 30% capacity, the government
would have to buy two extra tickets for
every one sold to individuals [for the
scheme to be of any real help]”.
“Most of the people involved in the
music events industry work on a free-
lance basis. They are the people who
need funding the most and are fall-
ing through the cracks currently” says
George. While it is undeniable that
the furlough scheme and the ‘self-em-
ployment income support scheme’
(SEISS) have been moderately helpful
to most, the fact remains that these
schemes are unfavourable to freelancers
and other members of the industry for
whom work is seasonal. Most freelanc-
ers operate through their own limited
companies and are often paid out with
dividends, making them ineligible to
avail government relief through these
schemes, and with the furlough scheme
and SEISS winding down in October,
what little support was otherwise avail-
able is going to vanish.
It is a difficult outlook indeed, both
for the people and fiscally for the gov-
ernment. The current relief efforts
and financial support by the govern-
ment across industries have greatly in-
creased the country’s debt. “One of the
things we would like to see from the
government is guarantee cancellation
insurance for the events”, he goes on to
say, “because at this
point, it’s not
thatthemeans
aren’t there
to handle
events... but
the financial
downside of
a cancellation
due to lock-
down or an-
ything is too
high a risk”.
Cancellations
related to COVID-19 are generally not
covered by insurance providers.
Even with socially distanced perfor-
manceshowever,therearetwoconcerns
looming. Scale and public confidence.
The latter is something George is con-
fident about, “With enough measures
and proper outreach it is possible to at-
tract people, because there is demand”.
But the former, scale, is something that
even George is sceptical about. Perfor-
mances depend on a minimum footfall
to break even, but with reduced capac-
ity performances now being the norm,
these events are likely to add more fi-
nancialstrainonproducersandtheatres
in the long run than do any real good.
Regarding the future of the industry,
George feels ambivalent. He is certain-
ly excited about the prospect of music
festivals gaining an online dimension.
The pandemic has pushed the industry
to find ever more innovative ways of
reaching their audience, with e-festivals
propping up all over Europe and Amer-
ica. “But a lot of companies are folding
up, going bust… Their equipment is be-
ing bought pennies to the pound, either
by companies without the necessary
experience or expertise here in the UK
who don’t know what to do with them,
or by companies on mainland Europe”
he goes on to say.
As he says this, his smile goes away,
and he says the dreaded word, one that
we have all been avoiding for the past
few months — Brexit. “We shouldn’t
forget that we are facing two issues at
this time. Every industry is facing the
brunt of the pandemic and the fallout
of Brexit, which will hit us in earnest
in January 2021” he warns. Of course,
with everything happening, that is per-
haps the last thing on our minds, but
George worries that Brexit is going to
lead to brain drain for the industry, as
people with niche skills move to other
lucrative mainstream jobs or find op-
portunities elsewhere in mainland Eu-
rope.
There have been constant calls on
the government from familiar faces in
the industry to do more. A nationwide
demonstration, #WeMakeEvents, took
place on the 11th of August to bring
awareness to the plight of the supply
chain workers of the live events in-
dustry. The group have since regularly
organised events to create awareness
across the UK. “We basically want to
bring to light the concerns of the sup-
ply chain, freelance engineers, lighting
equipment manufacturers... people
who don’t fit in the current definition
of the government relief package” ex-
plains George. This call has indeed
resonated with a lot of people and
the movement has taken a shape
of its own. There are now #We-
MakeEvents movements in
the USA, Netherlands and in
Northern Ireland.
This resonance across coun-
tries is certainly a sign that this
is indeed uncharted territory for
everyone. George smiles as he ac-
knowledges this and signs
off by saying, “We will
pull through, people
always need art and
music… it’s not go-
ing anywhere, and
neither are we”. As a sign of things to
come - musicals are scheduled to make
a return to the West End on the 14th of
November, with ‘Six’, as the wildly pop-
ular show about the six wives of Hen-
ry VIII relocates to a larger venue for a
socially distanced run. Most West End
theatres have confirmed that they will
remain closed at least until early 2021.
But with the second wave of the pan-
demic hitting soon and with the risk of
a lockdown, I wasn’t very hopeful - but
I didn’t let my scepticism show. George
was an optimistic person - all things
considered. He had a certain cheerful-
ness — even when our conversations
meandered on the dismal outlook of
his industry and livelihood. Call it
what you want, ‘Spirit’, ‘Resolve’, ‘Mox-
ie’, ‘Je ne sais quoi’, he seemed to have
it… I have seen it in many before, the
bus driver who shuttled many during
the lockdown, the clerk at the super-
market who donned a mask at the high
of the first wave, the NHS staff who are
still battling this virus. Whatever it is
— it’s going to take something greater
than this pandemic to knock people
like George down. After the interview I
watched him walk away and merge into
the crowds at Fulham Broadway - one
among many, braving this pandemic
and eager to make the world a better
place on the other side of this mess.
