Professor Sir Martin Hairer, Chair in
Probability and Stochastic Analysis
at Imperial College London, has just
been awarded the $3m 2021 Break-
through Prize for contributions to the
mathematical field of stochastic analy-
sis.
The Breakthrough Prize was founded
by billionaire philanthropists such as
Sergey Brin of Google and Mark Zuck-
erberg of Facebook. First awarded in
2012, it aims to “honour the most pro-
found and transformative discoveries”
and counts Stephen Hawking amongst
its laureates.
Sir Martin Hairer has previously
been awarded the prestigious Fields
Medal and joined the maths depart-
ment at Imperial in 2017.
Felix sat down with Sir Martin Hair-
er (over Microsoft Teams, of course) to
discuss his research and what it’s like to
win a $3m prize.
Felix: Firstly, congratulations on
winning the Breakthrough Prize!
How did you feel when you heard you
had won?
MH: Surprised! I was first told by
the head of the selection committee,
Terence Tao. I didn’t expect that at all
- he sent me an email asking if we could
have a chat on Skype, and we were both
involved in the organisation of the next
Congress of Mathematics, so I just
thought it was something about that.
But obviously I was extremely happy
and honoured that they selected my
work for that prize.
Felix: Has there been a ceremony?
MH: Not yet - the ceremony was
meant to be in November, but because
of the whole COVID situation that’s
notworkingout.Soit’sbeenpostponed
to the end of March. We’ll see how that
turns out.
Felix: You’ve been recognised for
your work in stochastic partial differ-
ential equations. How would you de-
scribe this field?
MH: So first I should start by ex-
plaining what a differential equation is.
These equations are used to describe,
for example, the movement of celestial
bodies. In that case, you have a physical
law that tells you how their position,
which is a function, changes instanta-
neously with time. Now, partial dif-
ferential equations are a similar type
of equation, but where you could have
a function dependent on two or more
variables – so before we had time, and
now space can join the game as well.
These can describe the motion of a
fluid, and the function would be the
velocity of the fluid at every point de-
pendent on density, maybe tempera-
ture and other parameters as well. So it
would vary not just in time, but also in
space, and the partial differential equa-
tions that describe this system will also
involve both time and space.
Stochastic partial differential equa-
tions consider the randomness of the
system. There’s some random influ-
ence that acts on
your system,
and there would
be an addition-
al term in the
equation to de-
scribe that. So
for our fluid ex-
ample, random-
ness could be
thermal fluctu-
ations, or wind
blowing on the surface of the water.
One example I’ve used several times is
stirring a cup of tea – the motion of the
spoon might be modelled by a random
term. These are the type of equations I
am interested in.
More specifically, the chunk of work
I got the prize for was for analysing a
class of such equations where the solu-
tions are extremely irregular, and the
randomness acts in such a way that the
solutions vary rap-
idly in space. They
become so irregu-
lar that when you
write down an
equation, it’s not
even clear how to
interpret the equa-
tion from a math-
ematical point of
view.
Felix: So these solutions are not
even analytical then?
MH: No, not at all, in some cases
