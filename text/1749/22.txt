pen. This is the most important event
of the year for us as it’s the first show
experience most freshers will have with
our society. It’s not going to look the
same as previous Revues, but it will be
just as good (if not better).
ICSM Drama: Where we can, we
will aim to produce performances for
audiences to see. Whether this be in
the form of short films, pre-recorded
theatre, or sketches written and direct-
ed by members of our society, there
are many ways to produce theatre and
perform. Having an online presence
will encourage involvement from all
years (so even first years can get in-
volved in the creative process if you
so wish) to create short scenes/plays/
record monologues and much more.
We’re planning
for all eventuali-
ties and I’m sure
we’ll find a way
to spend the year
doing what we
love. We are also
hoping to put
a big emphasis
on meeting as
often as we can-
whether that’s in
person or virtual - as we can’t go very
long without seeing each other’s faces.
ICSM Light Opera: Because of the
current government guidance, we have
found it difficult to stage our normal
Main Opera musical at the end of this
term. However, instead of a full show,
our incredible committee have been
working to put together a musical
revue this term. This will be socially
distanced (of course) and will feature
loads of numbers with lots of opportu-
nities for everyone to get involved! We
aim to release this online before the
end of term so everyone can enjoy it as
much as we will enjoy making it.
How can the incoming freshers get
involved in your societies given the cur-
rent situation?
DramSoc: We’ll definitely be having
events for Freshers – our workshops
and events are open to everyone,
regardless of experience. A lot of our
members have never performed or
done any tech before uni, but we’re all
really friendly so definitely get in-
volved! We’ll hopefully be putting on
some virtual shows as well, so if you’re
interested in performing, get in touch
with acting@dramsoc.org!
MTSoc: We have a student-led
dance workshop on Wednesday 7th
of October, where we will also host a
short Q&A after each session! This is
a free but ticketed event; keep an eye
on our social media and the Union
website for when tickets go live! For
any questions, contact us via email at
musical@ic.ac.uk, or drop us a message
on Facebook!
ICSM Drama: Freshers are an
integral part of ICSM Drama. You
will have as much of an opportunity to
join in with the acting, and backstage
production teams as everyone else.
We really encourage you to join our
socials (or as many as you can) just to
get to know everyone.
Because, as much as we
all say it’s a cliché, we
really are a family unit
that will welcome any-
one who wants to join,
regardless of previous
acting or technical
skills. We also offer
academic support for
the medics, across all
years, and try to have
socials as often as possible so we’ll be
super keen to help with anything you’re
struggling with throughout your time
at Imperial (and beyond - our Alumni
are always keen to come back and see
our shows). When you join ICSM
Drama, you make lifelong friendships
- acting, directing, producing, build-
ing sets, rigging lights, and making
costumes are a bonus! If you have any
questions about the society or any of
the changes we’ll be implementing,
feel free to find us on Facebook or
Instagram @icsmdrama and drop us a
message. We’d love to hear from you.
ICSM Light Opera: Make sure to
follow us on our socials (Instagram:
@icsmlightopera, Facebook: ICSM
Light Opera) to keep up to date with
all of our Opera antics! We will also
be posting all of our updates here and
on our mailing list, so be sure to come
and check us out at the Welcome Fair
if you’d like to see what we’re all about!
Alternatively, if you fancy getting
involved in Light Opera this year, feel
free to drop me an email (flw16@ic.ac.
uk) for more information!
