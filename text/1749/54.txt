COVID truly messed things up.
With activities such as being able
to pop into the gym whenever you
wanted or having teammates cheering
you on banned, we were left confined
for months on end to a room or house.
For many, this had the effect of sapping
away any motivation to do anything ex-
cept watch Netflix, binge eat, and may-
be occasionally bake banana bread.
One of the many perks of going to
a gym that most people don’t realize is
the change of scenery that it can bring.
The atmosphere helps you break out of
your house mindset, the place where
you sleep, eat, and watch movies into
your gym mindset, compelling you to
sweat, move, and lift weights. If you are
confined to a small space, finding the
motivation to break the habit or rou-
tine of being a COVID-couch potato
can be incredibly difficult.
Level of confinement varied from
country to country; some people were
able to leave their homes while others
were forced to stay in a single room. I
empathise with the latter. I was only
able to run in a confined space of 10
meters back and forth; it’s impressive
how much a 5km run works the calves
when you have to
almost continu-
ously turn 180 de-
grees. The reason
for this lunacy was
a two-week man-
datory quarantine
in a hotel room
in Australia; I am
not a fitness fanat-
ic, I just had to do
something to fill
up 16 hours of the
day for 14 days to
stop myself from
going crazy and
there are only so many movies you can
watch a day.
After hours of scrolling through Ins-

hole of watching videos of people doing
home workouts in the time of COVID.
Watching many people getting fit does
bring out a certain motivation (or guilt)
to exercise as well. However, the strug-
gle then comes to try to find exercises
to do. Many people who
post “no equipment”
workouts leave small
footnotes saying, “apart
from some dumbbells,
kettlebells, and exercise
bands”, which might
most people don’t just
have laying around.
Even after final-
ly finding exercises I
could do with my own
body weight, I realized
I wasn’t as motivated
to push myself to finish
sets and would often
find myself finishing early. Noticing
this, it took even more energy to try to
force myself to keep going.
The silver lining of it all after getting
myselfthroughafullbodyweightwork-
out, was realizing I felt just as accom-
plished and as sore (and had worked
out muscles I didn’t know existed) as if
I had done a hard day of weights. Once
you accept the limitations of the exer-
cises and work with what you have, you
realize you can still make the most of it
and still get the exercise you need from
it.
However, this is in no way to try and
tell anyone that they should or could
have exercised during quarantine. It is
completely ok if you didn’t work out.
It was a very challenging time and there
is no need to put that extra pressure
on yourself. There is no point trying
to exercise if it’ll strain and drain you
mentally and emotionally or if you just
don’t feel like doing it. This was just to
try and put into words the multiple as-
pects as to why it is so difficult to exer-
cise during a world pandemic outside of
the obvious.
