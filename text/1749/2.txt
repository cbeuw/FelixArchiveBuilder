The cancellation of A level exams in
March 2020 left students and the
examinations regulator Ofqual with a
fundamental dilemma - to accept centre
assessed grades calculated by teachers
(CAGs) or obtain grades for students
alternatively. The government decided on
the latter, building an algorithm to de-
termine grades based on previous centre
(school or sixth form) attainment and
the ranking of each student relative to
others in their school.
Concerns were
raised for months
after the announce-
ment - MPs warned
that only 16% of
students actually
achieve their predict-
ed grades, prediction
can be mired with
bias and the system
of ranking relative
to past results may
disadvantage bright
students at histori-
cally low-achieving
schools. On results
day, the problems with this approach
became evident, and after four days of
chaos - students being marked down or
even failed in exams they hadn’t taken,
losing out on university places and being
pushed into gap years - the decision was
reversed and students given CAGs. As
there was no freeze on admissions to uni-
versities in the interim, many institutions
were left with far more students meeting
their offers than they could cater for.
By the 7th of September, College had
contacted all affected incoming students,
advising them that they could either take
up their place or defer before enrolling in
October 2021. The ~100 students in the
latter situation are being offered men-
torship and support from college during
their gap year. For some, the year out will
offer the opportunity to develop new
skills and buffer entering University at a
time when the ‘University experience’ is
socially distanced and bound by behav-
iour codes and hygiene rules. However,
with some university educators already
concerned about the knowledge gap pro-
duced by students out of education for
six months, and a lack of jobs and travel
opportunities, having a gap year may be
daunting or in some cases completely
financially unfeasible.
Priority for places on courses this year
was offered to those from widening par-
ticipation backgrounds, as was advised
by the Office for Students - Imperial
College was recently ranked the 112th of
116 UK universities
for social inclusion
by the Times, and
given sustained
efforts to increase
the participation of
under-represented
groups in College,
this moment could
act as an inflection
point for the Uni-
versity to recon-
sider how to assess
incoming students
and dole out offers.
Exams further down
the line could create
similar admissions problems over the
next few years - GCSE grades were also
assigned by CAG, potentially affecting
university applications, and contingency
plans for exams under a potential lock-
down in 2021 have not been announced.
Students have also missed out a large
chunk of learning, that with a dysfunc-
tional track and trace system and whole
school years in covid bubbles could
become subject to more sporadic suspen-
sion. How the college will deal with this,
and how uncertainty around grades will
inform further widening participation
work remains to be seen.
