ProProspective students often ask
us whether it’s possible for them to
study medicine and to row at Impe-
rial. The answer is of course, yes- but
a brief look at the boat club history
reveals much more than that. It’s quite
astonishing to see the huge contribu-
tions our alumni are making in their
roles, not only within the NHS now,
but have also made to the boat club
over the years. Three members of
ICBC-Toby Heaton, Emily Boother
and Luke Whiting- were part of the
cohort of final year Imperial medi-
cal students who sat online exams to
graduate early and join the NHS staff
on the frontline. Toby was an active
committee member for many years,
including as men’s captain in 2017/8,
and dedicated a great deal of time to
organising last year’s very successful
Centenary Dinner.
They follow in the footsteps of last
year’s graduates Maddy Ardissino, Har-
ry Knights and Rachel Whiting. Mad-
dy learnt to row with us as a novice and
went on to represent Italy at the U23
World Championships in 2016. She
said of her time at Imperial:
“My time at ICBC has, hands down,
been the highlight of my time at univer-
sity.Ihavemetpeoplethathavebeenmy
best friends since. I loved the wins, took
the losses to make them into something
better, and everything I learned during
my time at ICBC definitely makes me a
better doctor.”
Jade Hubbard, Ollie Dent and Nina
Dalton are now in their FY2 as junior
doctors, while former team mate Tim
Richards is working as an intensive care
clinical fellow in Bristol having gradu-
ated a year prior in 2017.
Tim was part of the Imperial crew
which won the Prince Albert Challenge
Cup in 2013. All but one of this crew
were medical students. Coxswain, Ellie
Smith, studied medicine as a graduate
student:
“Rowing was a huge part of my life at
medical school,” said Ellie. “It provided
an amazing group of friends and unpar-
alleled experiences. I use the leadership
and team working skills every day in my
clinical practice and the early morning
training sessions even prepared me for
my early surgical
starts!”
Two-timeOlym-
pian and Rio silver
medallist, Melanie
Wilson, also stud-
ied graduate medi-
cine at Imperial. A
kind face around
the boat club from
time to time today,
there is no doubt that Mel has been and
continues to be a huge contributor to
ICBC alongside her work as an NHS
doctor.
“My time at Imperial was one of the
most challenging, and most rewarding
times in my rowing career. It’s given me
a deep-seated confidence that I don’t
think I could have found elsewhere.
Gettingthroughtoughperiodsoftrain-
ing and study has undoubtedly helped
me deal with working as a doctor in the
NHS. It’s given me my rowing career,
a n d
it’s also given me my career as a doctor.”

ni having worked at one of the NHS
Nightingale hospitals at the very fore-
front of the current pandemic. Peter
Reilly won at Henley in 1992 in a re-
cord-breaking time and is still working
as a consultant orthopaedic surgeon at
the Imperial College Healthcare Trust
over twenty-five years on. He remains
a valued supporter and contributor to
the club.
With seven current
students working to-
wards medial degrees
at present, there is no
doubt that this lega-
cy of success both on
and off the water will
continue.
“With medicine
being nearly twice
the length of most other degrees at Im-
perial, breaking up time spent in the li-
braryisquiteagoodidea,andICBChas
this way of making Monday 6ams seem
like that good idea,” said Gled, 2019/20
Club Captian. “For me, IC has provid-
ed a stable platform for progression and
confidence both in my sporting abilities
and in my studies.”
Our boat club Chairman, Professor
Alison McGregor, has dedicated a great
deal of support to the club, but also to
the sport of rowing in a wider sense,
leading a research project
into rowing kinematics
that contributed to the
success of the GB Row-
ing team at the London
2012 Olympic Games.
Professor Mc Gregor has
a unique outlook on our
medical student members
via her position in the Fac-
ulty of Medicine, and said:
“My involvement with
Imperial’s boat club came
through two medical stu-
dents, Rob Dennis and
Peter Holt, who- through
their persistence aided by
the head coach Bill Ma-
son- got me to research
back pain and injuries in
rowers. Their drive and commitment
drew me in and I am now part of this
large family. I see the skills they grow
and develop; rowing being so key to
their successes. Now they are qualified
doctors and their dedication to rowing
isreflectedintheirmedicalcareers.Iam
so proud of what they have achieved,
what they are doing and what I know
they will achieve in the years to come.”
As a club, we are exceptionally proud
of all of our medics and the incredible
work they are doing in this time of cri-
sis and grateful for everything they have
contributed to the club during their
time rowing for Imperial.
