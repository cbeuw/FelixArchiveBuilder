Letters to the Editor
Dear sir,
I am writing to complain about your awfully in-
termittent publication schedule. During the first
days of the national lockdown I searched high
and low for copies of Felix to use as loo paper, to
no avail. Please improve the reliability of your
printing.

Dear sir,
I am writing to demand you increase your cover-
age of my societyâ€™s events. As the Vice President
(Media relations) of the IC Friends of Javanese
Pygmy sloths your failure to do so shows reveals
you to be a palm oil loving hack. We are a central
part of Imperial culture. Do better.

features and glasses. If he reads this then would he
please contact me.
