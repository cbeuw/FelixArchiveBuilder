Nothing but Mayhem
Both the Prime Minister and the country face their fate in the parliamentary vote on the Brexit
deal next week.

T
heresa May’s
survival ability
is something to
behold. She could
be half-jokingly compared
to the character of the
Black Knight in Monty
Python’s Holy Grail who
kept fighting King Arthur
even after losing his four
limbs. In an ironic twist,
her constant resilience
mirrors that of Labour
leader Jeremy Corbyn,
her fiercest opponent in
Parliament (at least when
looking across the floor),
who has also survived
countless plots against
his leadership. However,
time is running out for the
Prime Minister, as next
week Parliament votes on
a Brexit deal that does not
look like it has the support
of a majority of MPs.
How did we get here?
Three weeks ago, the
Prime Minister finally
reached a deal with the
European institutions on
Brexit, which included
prerogatives on issues
as varied as the rights
and obligations of the
EU citizens staying in
the UK after the country
leaves the bloc and the
border situation between
the UK and the Republic
of Ireland. However, this
victory proved to be short-
lived as several cabinet
ministers, chief among
them Brexit Secretary
Dominic Raab (who was
supposed to be the main
negotiator behind the
accord) swiftly resigned,
citing deep disagreements
with the deal and the
negotiation strategy of
the Prime Minister. The
problem for May lies in
the fact that among the
ministers that left the
government one can find
both ardent Brexiteers and
passionate Remainers,
indicating that the deal
satisfies nobody but the
most loyal supporters of
the Prime Minister in her
party. Her situation has
been further complicated
by the permanent threat of
a confidence vote against
her leadership plotted by
the Conservative MPs of
the hard-core Euroscep-
tic European Research
Group, led by Jacob
Rees-Mogg and former
mayor of London and
former Foreign Secretary
Boris Johnson. So far,
it looks that the rebel
Tories do not have enough
support within the party
to trigger the vote against
May, but this impasse
could be broken next
week.
On Tuesday 11th
December 2018, the
honourable members of
the House of Commons
will vote on accepting
the Brexit deal brought
by Theresa May’s gov-
ernment. It is unlikely
that they will. Leaving
aside the fact that the
practical entirety of the
Labour, Scottish National
and Liberal Democrat
parties will vote against
it, the Prime Minister has
lost the support of her
main parliamentary ally,
the Northern Irish DUP.
This deprives her of an
effective majority to pass
the deal, and her mission
is further constrained by
the opposition of up to
60 Conservative MPs that
will not vote for her, ac-
cording to some sources.
Therefore, several sce-
narios are open once the
rejection of the accord
becomes a matter of fact.
What could happen?
Well, for once May may
resign, leading to a lead-
ership election within the
Conservative Party. The
new leader (who would
automatically become
the Prime Minister) may
seek to renegotiate the
deal or just scrap it and
leave the EU without any
has refused to concede
one more inch) fails to
pass, the government will
collapse and a general
election will be called.
May does not need to
resign for a people’s vote
to occur. If she sees that
Parliament will not be able
to make a decision, she
may call for an election,
or even a rerun of the
referendum. The EU has
heavily implied that the
transition period could
be expanded if the British
government decides to
bring the issue again to
the voters. Of course,
the question and options
will surely prove to be a
very controversial issue,
and one cannot ignore
that, again, she will have
to ask for parliamentary
approval in order to hold
another electoral process.
There is yet a third
scenario, which involves
May refusing to resign the
premiership. She could try

kind of deal whatsoever.
The latter possibility has
grown less likely this
week as Remainers in the
Conservative Party have
reached a secret agree-

would allow Parliament to
block the no-deal option.

Now’s the time to tune back into US news
The lemmings in power are jockeying for pole position, to be the first off the cliff in January.

G r i t m a s .
S i n c e
Parliament
voted to hold the govern-
ment in contempt, I’ve
been jerkin’ it constantly,
and have released more
“legal advice” than I knew
my body could produce.
Well, let’s get to it.
The Mueller probe is
chugging along. Trump
is now known to be “In-
dividual 1” - the central
focus of the investigation.
Legal briefs mention all
sorts of misconduct with
the term “Individual 1,”
including close work with
aides relating to the Rus-

sia-Trump Tower deal.
Spicily, Trump was to
offer Putin a $50 million
penthouse in Trump
Tower Moscow, ostensi-
bly to convince oligarchs
to buy up properties in
the building. Negotiations
over the deal carried on
well into Trump’s candi-
dacy - placing Trump in
direct legal peril.
The Feds have recently
raided the Chicago offices
of alderman Ed Burke,
who consulted on Trump’s
taxes for 12 years. There
be spicy information in
those there filing cabinets.
Can’t wait to see what
comes out of this tangle.
Speaking of raids
- Deutsche Bank got
a visit from German
police carrying out a
money-laundering probe.
You might remember
Deutsche Bank - former
associate SCOTUS justice
Anthony Kennedy’s son
ran the real-estate division
that bailed Trump out
during the Great Reces-
sion, when nobody else
would. Spice, spice, spice.
Janky dealings the whole
world over - a prosecution
is coming soon, and it’s
gonna be better than
WWE.
Manafort, Flynn, and
Cohen are expected in
court; Flynn has appar-
ently sang like a canary
(Mueller’s asked for no
jail time), and Cohen is
now openly contradicting
Trump in his testimony.
Manafort will get the book
thrown at him. Mueller
is over-prosecuting;
more details are likely to
emerge when the filings
are completed.
Changing tack, George
HW Bush died. His
disability legislation was
decent; his dedication to
bombing the Middle East
(a thirst shared by his
son) was not. Watching
Bob Dole get dragged
out of his wheelchair to
pay tribute stands in well,
metaphorically, for the
feeling I have trying not
to speak ill of the dead.
Wisconsin and
Michigan Republicans
are holding lame-duck
sessions to attempt to limit
the power of the incoming
governments. Bills
passed include slowing
an increase on minimum
wage, axing paid sick
time for companies with
fewer than 50 employees.
Other provisions target
the authority of the attor-
neys-general to prosecute
cases, and even contra-
dicting amendments to
state constitutions passed
in the last election cycle.
In other words - they’re
full of shit, and this is an
unprecedented power-gr-
ab. To the cheese-head
Rs: may your ventricles
promptly clog like the
2014 Congress.
Finally, the House
Dems are pushing
sweeping anti-corruption
legislation as their first
bill in the majority. This
bill, which will include
provisions for campaign
finance reform, strength-
ening ethics laws in the
executive and judiciary,
and expanding voting
rights, will be introduced
as HR.1 in early January.
For example - after holing
office in the Cabinet, indi-
viduals would be barred
for life from participating
in lobbying groups. Other
provisions provide for
transparency in PAC
donations - which directly
targets the dark-money
infrastructure that evolved
in the wake of the Citizens
United ruling. A tenner
says it won’t pass the
Senate; Republicans have
no shame.
Speaking of Bob Dole,
and having no shame -
one time he showed up
to Congress, lobbying
them to adopt the UN
Declaration on the Rights
of Disabled Persons; he
sat in his wheelchair and
watched his own party
vote down such a disgust-
ingly humane measure. To
reiterate a fundamental
position: our government
is run by lizards.
Well, folks - have a
pleasant end of term, a
merry Christmas, and a
happy new year. We’ll
be back at the start of
next term, venting leftist
propaganda into the void.
In time, comrades.
to renegotiate the deal in
Brussels, praying that the
EU softens its position.
That can be guaranteed
not to happen (the EU is
the stronger party here),
so this would most likely
result in the government
collapsing. Of course,
May may not even enjoy
the chance of carrying
on with the negotiation.
Her position untenable,
she may be toppled by
the Tory rebels. Go back
to the third paragraph of
the article to what would
happen. I know, Brexit is
a headache.
Nobody can claim in
confidence to know what
will happen. For what we
know, Theresa May may
be entering the last week
of her tenure, bringing an
end to an agonic and con-
voluted time in Number
10. Or, maybe, she will
prove her doubters wrong
for the nth time and
survive the defeat by the
skin of her teeth. Perhaps
the government will
miraculously get enough
Labour defections to pass
the deal, giving an end to a
negotiated Brexit. Perhaps
the British voters will be
recalled to the polls again,
either to vote for a new
government or to settle
the matter of Brexit once
and for all. The only thing
that is secure is that, as it
stands today, the United
Kingdom of Great Britain
and Northern Ireland will
leave the EU on the 11pm
of the 29th March 2019,
whether there is a deal or
whether there is none. We
can only wait and see.
