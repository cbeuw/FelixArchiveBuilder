As Tuesday's Brexit vote looms, Imperial left in dark
about future
NEWS
One fifth of Imperial's
student body is EU.
What do their futures
look like?

A
ll day the
news rumbles
on. Theresa
May contin-
ues to push her Brexit
deal, and MPs continue
to push back. The truth
becomes abundantly
clear, that not one pol-
itician, nor pundit truly
knows what Brexit looks
like for the people of
this country. In this cli-
mate, universities must
reassure their staff and
students alike, that their
futures are still secure.
Last week, the Provost
andPresidentsentanemail
to all staff saying they
are “ambitious about the
future.” They encouraged
staff to keep applying for
European research grants
and to continue to recruit
EU staff and students.
The College Brexit Ad-
visory Group, they added,
were preparing contingen-
cy plans for all scenarios.
Though what this actually
means is unclear.
These are all hopeful
statements in an uncertain
time.
Students themselves
have had little reassurance
so far. The government
has promised that EU stu-
dents applying until 2019,
will be guaranteed the
same fee status as UK stu-
dents. No promises have
been made beyond that so
far. Though Imperial say
they are campaigning for
the government to provide
clarification for the years
2020 and 2021.
Of all the student
populations in the UK,
Imperial’s has the third
largest proportion of EU
students. A fifth of Imperi-
al’s students are EU. More
so than UCL, Oxford and
Cambridge.
Imperial received £141
million in EU cash last
year and currently has
317 projects funded by
Horizon 2020 (second
only to UCL). The uni-
versity more so than any
other in this country will
be affected greatly by the
UK leaving the European
Union.
So what does the future
for Imperial look like?
Will the proportion of EU
students have to fall in
Imperial, after Brexit? So
far the signs suggest that
they will not.
Vice Provost of Educa-
tion, Simone E. Buitendi-
jk, told Felix that student
application numbers
“both from the EU and
the rest of the world, have
continued to grow since
the Brexit vote”.
It is widely assumed
other major research
intensive universities will
follow suit, and forge such
partnerships with other
EU universities. Buitendi-
jk says the partnership
with Munich will also
allow for “new student
exchanges and summer
schools.”
Buitendijk adds that the
university is campaigning
for “visa reforms that will
offer easier access for
international students to
come here and for recent
graduates to stay here”.
Ultimately though,
everything is up in the air,
and there is only so much
the university can do to
reassure us.
So for now, all Imperial
staff and students can do
is wait until Tuesday’s
vote on May’s Brexit deal,
and hope for the best.

Moreover, Imperial’s
recently acclaimed novel
partnership with the
Technical University of
Munich, could be a boon
for students too. The
partnership, the first of its
kind for a UK university,
means that any new hires
to Imperial, will work
jointly for both universi-
ties. This allows the staff
member to still apply
for certain EU research
projects.
