of momentum as we are
carried from plot twist to
plot twist. Minimalistic
and uncluttered staging
helps achieve this with
fluidity, while Helena
Bonner’s striking costume
designs for the witches
ensure we have our fill of
visually arresting scenes.
Dowd is undoubtedly
the star of the show, with
her brilliant, layered por-
trayal of Macbeth. Hungry
ambition, deep-seated
self-doubt and crushing
guilt are written trans-
parently in turn on her
expressive features,
and Macbeth’s famous
soliloquy “Tomorrow,
and tomorrow, and
tomorrow…” is delivered
with such raw vulnerabil-
ity that we really feel the
NYT Rep’s Macbeth
H
aving had
a chat with
both Macbeth
(Olivia Dowd)
and Lady Macbeth (Isabel
Adomakoh Young) a
fortnight prior, I was
particularly excited to
see them on stage for the
National Youth Theatre’s
production of Macbeth.
Moira Buffini’s abridged
version results in a snappy,
intense play which runs
straight through for just
under 100 minutes with
no interval between.
The production opens
with a bang, curtains
rising on the three trou-
blemaking witches who
craftily instigate most of
the trouble in Macbeth. In
keeping with the ‘gender-
fluid’ casting, two of them
are played by male actors,
Aidan Cheng and Jeffrey
Sangalang, with Simran
Hunjun completing the
trio. Gender doesn’t really
matter with the witches,
who even in Shake-
speare’s original were not
so much ‘female’ as ‘un-
classifiable’. Nixon has
really run with the freaky
theme for the witches
here; Cheng giggles
manically while tottering
around the stage in white
facepaint, fetish heels
and a fluffy tutu, while
Hunjun, draped head to
toe in red, wanders about
the stage like a monolithic
Cassandra. Cheng is
particularly convincing
in his ‘creepy clown’
portrayal, although I did
find it a bit over-the-top.
But perhaps that was the
point. The three of them
are a looming presence
throughout the play, and
reappear as Macbeth’s
hired assassins – a nice
touch that underscores the
central role of the witches
to the events of the plot.
The lack of an interval
works well, with no loss
empty meaninglessness
lurking behind its words.
Opposite her, Adomakoh
Young sparks with energy
as Lady Macbeth, urgently
spurringMacbethtoaction
in the first acts before
descending into a dark,
guilt-driven madness. It’s
a well-balanced partner-
ship, with genuine chem-
istry between the two of
them on stage.
For all that the
NYT’s Macbeth has
been advertised as a
genderfluid production,
the fact that Macbeth
and Lady Macbeth are
in a queer relationship
is barely noticeable. As
Adomakoh Young said,
there doesn’t really seem
to be a specific message
about gender that Nixon
and Buffini are trying to
bring across. Rather, if
it’s about getting the best
actors for each role, Dowd
has certainly delivered on
that promise.
The rest of the cast
delivers a solid support-
ing performance, but
there remains a touch
of the amateur about
it – overall it definitely
feels like a youth theatre
performance. Which,
admittedly, it is. The
point of NYT Rep is to
be a training programme
for young actors, and it’s
good to see casting open
up so that more actors,
male or female, can cut
their teeth on big roles
like Macbeth.
Having a laugh at Winter Wonderland
A
common theme
at Winter
Wonderland is
walking around
in the cold, drinking
mulled wine in the cold,
and riding the ridiculous
rollercoasters, also in the
cold. This year, there’s
a fresh new experience
to be had at Winter
Wonderland, brought
to us by the Evening
Standard. Every night
‘til the 6th
of January, the
heated Megadome will
come alive at 9pm for the
all-new Comedy Club.
A welcome respite from
the cold outdoors, and
a warming end to your
festive day.
Who’s hosting at
ComedyClub?It’samixof
everyone who’s someone
in the comedy scene today.
The oversized, slightly
ostentatious circus tent
is set to host big-name
headliners such as Mick
Ferry, Luisa Omielan and
Eric Lampaert, all for the
bargain price of £10 (£12
on Saturdays).
Tom Lucy kicks off
the show as compere
this evening, going for
openers which are rem-
iniscent of a third-year
medical student such as
“What’s your name?” and
“What’s your job?”. He’s
an amicable guy though
and does his best to
warm up the slightly cold
crowd by attempting to
find the furthest-travelled
audience member (New
Zealand) and the unfortu-
nate front-row members
who will be picked on for
the remaining 43 minutes
of the show. If you’ve
brought in a drink, just
have a sip every time
he mentions something
festive – you’re guaran-
teed to find the rest of the
show funny.
The first act of the
evening is Keith Farnan,
an upbeat Irishman who
is quick to charm the
audience by mocking
everyone that isn’t sitting
in the front row, and
through his relatable set
pieces on Brexit, buying
the perfect Christmas
present, and even GDPR.
His jokes may have been
PG-13, but his delivery
is spot-on and left the
audience feeling warm,
fuzzy and appreciative of
the festive spirit.
The headliner of the
evening, Terry Alderton
completely embodied the
mania of the atmosphere
outside; with bright
lights, loud noises and a
shocking Christmas shirt,
he pulled off one auda-
cious skit after another.
An explosion of energy,
his body-popping took the
front row by surprise, and
his operatic serenading of
fans had almost the entire
audience in hysterics.
So, if you’re visiting
with your mates, check
out the Comedy Club –
it’ll have you in stitches
one way or the other.
