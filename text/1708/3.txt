Why should you spend
one less day a week
eating meat?

anuary. New Year,
New Resolutions,
so why not intro-
duce some New
Changes?
This January, College
and the Union will be tri-
aling their joint campaign,
‘Meat Free Mondays’.
With student clubs
(Enviro Soc, Veg Soc &
APES), other interested
students and Greening
Imperial all wanting to
start similar initiatives,
they’ve combined forces
E
thos gym is to
be expanded
in the new
year, following
months of collaboration
between the Deputy
President (Clubs &
Societies) [DPCS],
Sport Imperial and the
College.
Ethos gym expanding!
This change comes
following complaints of
the gym being too small
and overcrowded in
feedback taken over the
last two years. Plans to
expand Ethos have been
in the works for the past
year, however funding for
the proposal has now been
secured.
The expansion will see
a new functional room
created within Ethos, to
cater for approximately
30 extra people, boosting
the gym's capacity up to
110 people. The initial
aim for the project com-
pletion is the end of the
current academic year,
with more information on
the designs and type of
space to be released in the
near future.
Expanding the gym
was the first of the DPCS,
James Medler's, manifesto
points and this announce-
ment can be seen as some-
thing of a success story. In
a recent blog post, James
states, "think of it as an
early Christmas present".
Imperial students are
being encouraged to
complete the Student Ex-
perience survey "so pro-
jects like the Ethos Gym
expansion can happen". In
a statement, James wrote:
"This project has
come about because of
the Student Experience
survey. Over 2 years, it
became overwhelmingly
obvious that there was a
desire and a need for the
gym's size and availability
to be improved. These
results were presented in
a paper to college which
has resulted in the funding
being given."
The Student Experi-
ence survey, which is
sent to all non-final year
students once a year,
provides students with the
opportunity to make their
voices heard by telling
the Union about their
experiences of Imperial
so that their time here can
be improved. Last year,
the survey received over
2000 responses but James
is urging more students to
complete the survey:
"This survey is one of
your major opportunities
to actually create positive
change at Imperial and
make a real difference.
The more of you filling it
out, the bigger the impact
the Student Voice has in
creating real change."
The 10-15 minute
survey covers a range of
areas and respondants to
are automatically entered
into a £500 prize draw
alongside the Deputy
President (Finance &
Services), College Cater-
ing and College Campus
Services to produce an
Imperial-wide campaign,
stretching over South
Kensington, Charing
Cross, Hammersmith and
Silwood Campuses!
is more and more research
into the impact this will
have on our world. The
United Nation’s Food and
Agriculture Organization
states that livestock are
responsible for 14.5% of
global greenhouse gases
produced. However,
during the Climate
Summit 2014 it was
highlighted that ‘reducing
methane emissions would
create tangible benefits
almost immediately’.
One simple fix to this:
spend one day fewer a
week eating meat. Not
only would this reduce
methane emissions from
animals, but cut down on
CO2
and nitrous oxide gas
production too.
Reducing our weekly
meat consumption has
many benefits, including
health improvements and
financial ease. But taking
a step back to look at the
wide picture, working
together to reduce the
world meat consumption
also has environmental,
social, and animal welfare
impacts.
Reynolds Bar (Charing
Cross) are all teaming up
to take part, with other
food outlets also consider-
ing joining in.
But that’s not all that’s
happening! Be prepared
for a packed month of
events, activities and pop
up stalls. Catch students
and staff at lunch times
on stalls explaining the
campaign, showing you
why it’s worth taking part,
and giving tips on how
to continue Meat Free
Mondays at home. Or,
join them in the evenings
for joint events with our
student clubs and societies
(more information will be
released soon).
