A Christmas Miracle
M
E R R Y
XMAS! It
may seem a
bit prema-
ture seeing as we only
touched December a week
ago, however, tonight,
a Christmas miracle is
taking place. You won't
guess what time I'm
writing this editorial. But
at the moment, we are on
course to submit the paper
on time. By on time, I
mean less than two hours
after the "print deadline".
Baby steps but progress
is being made. We keep it
moving!
Inanattempttoorganise
myself and speed up the
editing process, I actually
planned out my editorial
slightly. In the knowledge
that I would be without
my trusted ghostrwriting
sidekick (the Robin to
my Blackman), I knew
I would have to actually
pull my finger out for
omce.
The other day, I
reposted a meme I saw
on Instagram. The meme
said: "The fact that I pro-
crastinate and still get the
job done is the reason I
still procrastinate". Never
has a meme touched me
so deeply. I felt this with
every fibre of my being.
The reason I've been
sending the paper to print
later and later each week
is because I keep getting
away with it. The thought
of what will happen if
my risky game ever fails
to pay off fills me with
anxiety. Last week, I
acknowledged that the
jig is well and truly up.
As we approach the end
of the year, it is time for
reflection and, as I reflect
on my first term in the
role as editor, one thing I
definitely hope to improve
on is my organisational
skills. The late submission
is unsustainable and I
don't actually know what
would happen if Felix
went a week without
printing. To the printers, if
you're reading this by any
chance, I love you man.

Felix is recruiting!
We want you – yes, you! We’re looking for writers, photographers, editors, illustrators, report-
ers, computer experts and grammar nerds to join our team. No experience needed – we’ll teach
you everything you need to know. If you’re interested, send us an email on felix@ic.ac.uk
Wayne, you're my guy!
I'm rambling now...
This week, I made my
long-awaited, triumphant
return to the Music
section to give the culture
what it needs, my annual
Top Ten Hip-Hop albums
round-up.
I would be lying if I
told you I've spent longer
on an article this term. For
once, I started drafting this
article in advance, ahead
of a Thursday night. My
number one might be a
controversial pick but, it;s
my list so...
This week's issue is
the final issue of term.
I had hoped we could
go extra thicc this week
but, alas, it wasn't to be.
Regardless, the issue is 48
pages of quality content
as per and I can't help
but marvel at how far we
in the Felix team have
come. Felix Fam, we've
done a madness this term
to be honest. You've all
put in an almighty shift
and I couldn't be happier
with you! Time for a
well-earned break. I'm not
one to pick favourites and
maybe I'm showing my
bias here but Section of
the week is undoubtedly
the Music Section! Special
acknowledgement to the
Postgraduate section,
which is a new section
that we are looking to
grow next term. Anyway,
I'm going to wrap this up
now. See you in the new
year.
FELIX NAVIDAD!
