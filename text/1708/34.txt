S
unrise came. The
sun was finally
shining, giving
relief to a week of
grim weather.
It was BUCS duathlon.
The biggest race in the
duathlon calendar.
A season finale.
The challenge?A2 mile
run, followed by a 10 mile
bike, and then another 2
mile run.
Nice.
With an air of excite-
ment, the team travelled
down to Castle Coombe
racing circuit in Bath.
After hours of Ed2
chat
from the two Eds, the team
was relieved to finally
arrive at the course.
The squad spent the
remaining time sorting
out pre-race plaits,
matching wheel to bike
and admiring the TT bikes
that were almost certainly
going to lap them.
Before long the gun
went and they were off -
the ‘elite’ men.
Within, our very own
Romain, Ethan, and Ed
Clark set the bar high.
With the front of the
pack completing the 2
mile - 1 lap - run in under
9:30, they were already
in full aero gear pacing
it round on the bike in a
blink of an eye.
This was where our
own strengths shone
through - with Romain
coming in the top 30 for
the bike leg.
Then as soon as they
had begun they were
striding through the final
run chasing down the rest
of the field.
Swiftly following the
men, the ‘elite’ women set
off, featuring much-loved
alumna member Millie.
The wind was picking
up meaning for half the
bike lap one would feel
lightning quick and for the
the other half one would
“look like you were just
pedalling static.”
In spite of this, the
team emerged strongly
with everyone coming
in within an hour and
improving on last year’s
times!
The final mixed race
of the day provided
excellent performances
all-round to finish off an
already amazing day, with
seasoned Imperial triath-
letes like Ema and new
club freshers showing
how it’s done.
Shoutout to Ed for not
only driving us there and
back despite being injured
but also for capturing
some beautiful and pho-
togenic action shots of
these moments along with
David Ho - Instagram
anyone?
The day topped off by
the eating of countless
cakes and treats brought
along by the team.
Turns out Triathlon will
cycle for cake - who knew.
T
his week Cross
Country &
Athletics ditched
muddy hills to
tackle some faster terrain
- an indoor athletics track.
The state-of-the-art Lee
Valley Athletics Centre is
situated amidst a desolate
wasteland in the far
reaches of north London.
After meeting at Beit
Quad to collect some of
the famous navy and blue
running vests, the squad
made the arduous journey
via two tube lines, an
overground and a bus.
Imperial was packed
with a strong team consist-
ing of everything - sprint-
ers, throwers, jumpers and
distance athletes.
In the men’s team, the
highlights came in the
middle distance events,
where club-favourite
James Millett took on both
the 800m and the 1500m.
In an exhilarating
800m race in which he
was leading the way for
a good portion of the 4
laps, he narrowly missed
out on a medal after being
outsprinted by the LSE
and Barts athletes, and
finished in 2:03.94.
Undeterred and deter-
mined to bounce back in
the longer 1500m - his
favourite event - Millett
went one better than last
year to scoop a silver
medal in a fantastic time
of 4:15.17.
The star of the day was
on the women’s side, with
Kate Olding bringing
home two golds and
retaining a rather large
800m trophy for the two
middle distance events.
She ran two masterfully
tactical races, turning up
the pace in the final laps
to finish a huge 8 seconds
clear in the 800m and 5
seconds clear of teammate
Steph Hewitt in the
1500m.
Steph also comfortably
brought home the silver in
the 3000m - an impressive
feat after racing in the two
longest races of the day.
There was a number of
stand-out performances
from some first-years,
with orienteering scholar
Mihaly Ormay coming
11thand12thinthe1500m
and 3000m respectively.
Also doing it for
the freshers was Alix
Vermeulen who came
an impressive 6th in the
women’s 1500m and 14th
in the long jump. Fellow
women’s fresher Nina
Rimsky came 10th in the
3000m.
Taking home the 6th
and final Imperial medal
of the day was Marta Van
Ginkel Gonzalez, who
leapt 9.36m in the triple
jump.

sprinter Mahmoud Barrie
winning the infamous
Mascot Race by out-
sprinting a griffin, polar
bear, giant man and a cow
being milked
Overall, Imperial
finished an impressive 4th
out of the 15 teams in the
LUCA Championships.
The competition con-
tinued at a joint social
with a number of other
London colleges, where
there were very many
games of beer pong.
It transpired that
Imperial is stronger on
the athletics track than at
throwing table tennis balls
into red cups of beer!
