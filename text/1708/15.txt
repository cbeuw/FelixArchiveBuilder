Thebe’s flows have
always been dense and
polysyllabic, dripping
with the influence of
underground legends like
MF DOOM. On Some
Rap Songs he folds them
together with even greater
intricacy, albeit at the

Earl Sweatshirt’s back at it with some rap songs
Rap’s prodigal son delivers his most focused (and challenging) effort yet.
W
ith his
c r i t i c a l l y
acclaimed
debut Earl
dropping at just 16, Thebe
Kgositsile has a strong
claim to the familiarity
with his audience the title
of his latest release - Some
Rap Songs presumes.
With a 24 minute run
time (admittedly less
surprising in 2018) and
eerily blurred selfie as its
cover, Earl is making an
understated return after
two years of silence.
“Imprecise words”
chimes a sample of
60s social critic James
Baldwin on the album’s
opener: ‘Shattered
Dreams’. Earl, son of
recently deceased poet
Keorapetse Kgositsile,
has always shone as a
lyricist, with unforget-
table features including
Odd Future’s ‘Oldie’
and Danny Brown’s
star-studded ‘Really
Doe’. However, on his
own material, the lyrical
expectations of hip-hop,
as well as the imprecision
of language have hindered
him from delving into the
darkness that permeates
his music.
Throughout this record,
Earl digs deeper into
his emotions, a theme
punctuated with imagery
of bleeding or drowning
“It was holes in the boat,
we ain’t make a fuss”
rhymes Thebe on ‘Shat-
tered Dreams’, while
the refrain repeats “Why
ain’t nobody tell me I was
bleeding? / Please nobody
pinch me out this dream”.
Earl shows a much
deeper understanding of
the malaise that plagues
him and uses it to provide
us a much more visceral
tour of his private hell.
“…I revisit the past / Port
Wine and pages of pass /
Momma say don’t play
with them scabs / It’s safe
to say I see the reason
why I’m bleeding out” are
shining examples of this
from ‘Ontheway!’, a track
featuring the genre-bend-
ing Standing on the
Corner. “Pages of pass”
referencing the apartheid
in South Africa where
Earl has roots, while also
mentioning the impor-
tance of Earl’s mother as
a supporting figure.
On the album’s first
single: ‘Nowhere2go’ we
hear Earl even more raw
“…spent most of my life
depressed / only thing
on my mind was death”,
perhaps more impactful
when surrounded by
tracks about Earl “pissing
problems out the bottle”
and other references to
his substance problems-
“muffle my pain and
muzzle my brain up”. The
24-year-old rapper seems
much more at terms with
“Some Rap
Songs is not for
background
listening, not
for the faint at
heart.”
ble ease and languor over
his knotty, sample-based
instrumentals, keen listen-
ing is necessary to catch
half of the subtlety of
the verses on this record.
This is not helped by the
vocal mixing of the LP,
which finds vocals buried
almost beneath the hiss
and crackle of J Dilla style
loops.
The production on this
record distinguishes it
greatly from his previous
work: while Doris bustled
with synthesisers and I
Don’t Like Shit I Don’t Go
Outside packed aggres-
sive drum machines, SRS
is built almost entirely
from samples. Simple,
brutish loops often slowed
beyond recognisability
and far from sweet on the
ear.
While Earl handles
most of the production
on Some Rap Songs
himself, its more beautiful
moments come when
other producers take
the wheel. ‘Azucar’ is

produced by pro-skater
and Odd Future affiliate
Sage Elsseser, a heavenly
mixture of xylophones
and strings, dropping in,
out and behind walls of
EQ seemingly at random.
Other stand out instrumen-
tals include the glitched
vocals of ‘Nowhere2go’
and ‘Peanut’ built largely
on vinyl hiss and spare
piano notes, matching
Earl’s sombre ruminations
on his fathers’ death.
Some Rap Songs is not
for background listening,
nor the faint at heart: it
unapologetically demands
the listener’s attention for
its entire run time to even
catch Earl’s lyrics. While
this can be a difficult task
- it rewards the listener
by shedding its calloused
exterior to reveal brutally
honest poetry and innova-
tive instrumentals. There
is little doubt this record
will have a huge influence
on innumerable artists,
even if it doesn’t make a
splash straight away.
