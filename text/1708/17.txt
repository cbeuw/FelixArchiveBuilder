Andy’s Top Ten Hip-Hop Albums of 2018

I
don’t actually think
2018 has been a very
good year for hip-
hop. There were very
few ambitious projects
dropped this year and
not enough artists took
risks with their music. J.
Cole’s KOD is a prime
example. Although a very
good album, with it being
featureless again, it felt
like he produced much of
the same.
Kanye attempted
to shake things up but
that whole June weekly
seven-track album experi-
ment was just a hot mess.
From that mess, the only
albums that are even in
end-of-year conversations
are Pusha T’s Daytona
and KIDS SEE GHOSTS.
Having said that, there
are some honourable
mentions that couldn’t
quite make this list. From
stellar projects from
seasoned veterans like
Nipsey Hussle (Victory
Lap) and Royce da 5’9’’
(Book of Ryan), to impres-
sive sophomore efforts
from lesser known artists
like Noname (Room 25),
Saba (CARE FOR ME)
and Dreamville-signee
J.I.D. (DiCaprio 2),
let’s get into 2018’s top
hip-hop albums.
very nearly made my list
but, in the end, I had to
go for my guy Kendrick.
The Black Panther film
was a moment and this
soundtrack, curated by
Kendrick, complemented
it well. This album may
also be the closest we
will ever get to having a
Black Hippy album so we
should relish what we can
while we can.

personality to the first
female rapper to claim
the top spot on the Hot
100 chart since Lauryn
Hill in 1998. Her breakout
single, ‘Bodak Yellow’,
was a ubiquitous smash
and pressure mounted
ahead of the release of
her debut album. I was
intrigued to hear what
a Cardi B album would
even sound like and to
see how she would handle
the pressure and weight
of expectation on her
shoulders. With Invasion
of Privacy, Cardi delivers
a surprisingly impressive
debut album which is an
enjoyable listen all round.
With Nicki Minaj’s antics
in 2018 showing that she’s
absolutely done out here,
Cardi has cemented her
position as the new Queen
of rap.
sounds as focused as ever.
Even the album cover
screams focus. Meek
Mill has been stalked by
the system for almost the
entirety of his adult life,
following a gun charge
when he was 18, and,
although Meek Mill has
always used his music to
discuss the flaws in the
American criminal justice
system, the message now
sounds more urgent and
pressing on this album.
This discussion comes to
a head on the Rick Ross
and Jay Z assisted ‘What’s
Free’, on which Jay spits
one of the best verses I’ve
ever heard. One criticism
of the album is that it’s
a bit long but if you’re
going to fit in both the
typical Meek Mill tracks
stunting about money,
cars and jewellery, and
a serious conversation
about prison reform on to
one album, what do you
expect?
tracks long and 1 hour
28 minutes is too long.
However, in this case, it’s
cause for celebration; after
keeping it from us for four
years, Birdman finally
freed up the ting! Tha
Carter V is one of those
rare albums that actually
lived up to the insatiable
hype that had built up
while we waited patiently.
‘Dedicate’ starts with the
declaration, “if it wasn’t
for Wayne, it wouldn’t
be!”, and this album serves
as a necessary reminder
of Wayne’s impact on
the game. Lil Wayne’s
influence pervades the
current hip-hop scene;
he’s basically fathered
half the game and his
legacy deserves respect.
Wayne packs this album
with more bars than seems
possible and reminds
us why he deserves to
be mentioned in GOAT
conversations (he’s firmly
in my personal top five).
On ‘Dope New Gospel’,
Wayne spits, “thank God
Weezy back / Order is
restored, all is right with
the world”. Couldn’t
have put it better myself.

I may be showing my
bias here but I had to
include my mandatory
TDE album. Jay Rock’s
Redemption was an
excellent showing and
I wasn’t actually
feeling this album the
first time I listened to it. It
took me a few spins to get
into it because Smino’s
music has such a weird
vibe to it. With his unique
blend of melodic singing/
rapping, it’s often difficult
to understand what Smino
is saying. There’s a lot
going on in this album
and Smino includes a
host of skits and different
voices which make the
album difficult to follow
at times. However, it is
important to appreciate
that this is a reflection of
his creativity. This album
is undoubtedly a vibe and
a solid follow up to 2017’s
Blkswn.

Oxnard
Anderson .Paak
It feels strange to say
that I was left slightly
disappointed by Anderson
.Paak’s album. Prior to
hearing it, I thought that
Cheeky Andy would
deliver the album of the
year with Oxnard. Un-
fortunately, although it is
still a very good album,
Oxnard is not that. What
Oxnard is, is a typically
funky, groovy, summery
project filled with no bad
songs and many enjoyable
funny skits. The strength
of the features on this
album is indicative of how
well-respected Anderson
.Paak is in modern
hip-hop.
Cardi B’s meteoric rise
to the pinnacle of hip-hop

of legend. In two years,

Ever since “getting

his 2015 beef with Drake,
Meek Mill has held
more than his fair share
of Ls. However, none
more so than violating
his probation and getting
sent back to jail for five
months “just for poppin’ a
wheelie”. However, Meek
has managed to flip his
accumulated Ls into the
biggest W. He’s back and

Although Astroworld is
musically in keeping with
the rest of Travis Scott’s
discography and doesn’t
sound very far from what
we’ve come to expect
from the Houston rapper,
something feels different
about this album. It is
almost like Travis has
moulded his career after
Kanye West’s early career
because Astroworld feels
like Travis Scott’s Grad-
uation moment. That is to
say, the moment his music
transcends hip-hop and
receives mainstream rec-
ognition and accolades.
Following the success of
his two early mixtapes
Owl Pharoah and Days
Before Rodeo in growing
a cult following, and
the success of his two
previous albums Rodeo
and Birds in the Trap Sing
McKnight in cultivating
this following, Astroworld
appears to be the album to
propel Travis Scott to the
superstar status only held
by artists like Kendrick
Lamar, Drake and J. Cole.
Astroworld is a crisp
listen and the album takes
listeners on a chaotic roll-
ercoaster journey guided
by Travis Scott’s unique
musical vision.

On reflection, Jay-Z is
actually lucky he cheated
on Beyoncé with “Becky
with the good hair”.
His infidelity spawned
a world tour and three
amazing albums, Beyon-
cé’s Lemonade, Jay-Z’s
4:44 and now this.
Lemonade was Beyon-
cé’s abrasive warning shot
to Jay-Z, addressing his
cheating and declaring
she is not a woman to
be messed with. After
sounding uninspired on
2013’s Magna Carta Holy
Grail, Jay-Z delivered a
masterpiece and one of the
best albums of 2017 with
his apology album, 4:44.
EVERYTHING IS LOVE is
a celebration of love. Not
to sound moist but, when
I listen to this album, I
can’t help but think, “their
love is so pure”. Beyoncé
really rides for Jay and
the post-infidelity Carters
embody black love at its
finest. That is not to say
that black love involves
infidelity (I don’t know
if I’ll ever fully forgive
Jay for jeapordising the
“Black Men Don’t Cheat”
movement) or that women
should tolerate cheating
just because Beyoncé did.
Although, to an extent,
this sounds like a Beyoncé
album with Jay-Z on it, it
sounds truly collaborative
and Beyonce proves she’s
a better rapper than most
of the game right now.
Also, it can’t be overstated
how important the narra-
tive around building black
generational wealth on
the album is. The Carters
remain relationship goals.
Ties’ and ‘Can’t Take a
Joke’, we all owe Pusha
T a debt of gratitude for
dishing out the fattest L
and forcing Drake to get
in his bag and give us the
album we deserve.
being a basketballer and
Steph’s shooting ability
doesn’t mean he overtakes
Lebron as the best player
alive, making hit songs is
only one aspect of being
a rapper and has little
bearing on the quality of
Drake’s albums. Having
said all that, it’s impos-
sible to overlook the
sheer number of potential
hits on Scorpion, from
‘Nonstop’ to ‘After Dark’.
At 25 tracks and 90
minutes, Scorpion is
simply too long. However,
the fact that it’s a double
disk album somehow
made it easier for me
to simply discard the
tracks I don’t like from
what is a bloated album.
Once I did the necessary
fat trimming, removing
tracks which appeal to a
different type of Drake
fan to me, like ‘Peak’,
‘Summer Games’ (which
sounds like progressive
church music to me) and
‘Ratchet Happy Birthday’,
I was left with a custom
Scorpion which gave me
everything I needed from
Drake in 2018.
*I know what you’re
thinking. “Andy, didn’t
you just say don’t let
Drake’s hit-making dis-
tract you from the quality
of the album itself? You
can’t just cut out the songs
you don’t like and say the
remaining tracks are al-
bum of the year?”
I’m sorry but I just
can’t ignore the hits on
my custom Scorpion:
1. Survival
2. Nonstop
3.Elevate
4.Emotionless
5.God’s Plan
6.8 Out Of 10
7. Mob Ties
8. Can’t Take a Joke
9. Sandra’s Rose
10. Talk Up
11. Is There More
12. Finesse
13. That’s How You Feel
14. Blue Tint
15. In My Feelings
16. After Dark
17. Final Fantasy

“Astroworld
feels like
Travis Scott’s
Graduation
moment”
With Mac Miller’s and
Travis’ albums dropping
on the same day, it was
impossible not to directly
compare the two. Of the
two, I lean toward Mac
Miller’s, simply because
Swimming provides a
different vibe - something
to chill to.
Mac Miller had been
on a musical journey of
creative development and
his last album, The Divine
Feminine, proved that
the days of ‘Easy Mac
with the Cheesy Raps’
were long gone. After
effectively dedicating
The Divine Feminine
to his love for Ariana
Grande and, following the
couple’s ensuing public
breakup, I was expecting
Swimming to be a bitter
breakup album. However,
with Swimming, Mac
delivered a mature album
addressing his personal
struggle with mental
health, suicidal thoughts
and addiction. He poet-
ically described dealing
with these as floating and
drowning simultaneously.
The album sounded like
it was a turning point for
him, however his contant
battle with his demons,
namely depression and
substance abuse, ultimate-
ly cost him his life. Mac
Miller sadly passed away
on 7th
September, at age
26. The only thing left to
say is R.I.P. Mac Miller.
Your music touched
a generation and will
continue to live on for
years to come.
The fact that Scorpion
lands so highly on my list
is not an indication of the
quality of the album but
more an indictment on the
state of hip-hop in 2018.
Drake has had a very inter-
esting 2018. After seeing
the end of his phenomenal
eight-year Billboard Hot
100 Streak finally come
to an end in a quiet end
to 2017 (by his own
lofty standards), Drake
suddenly faced doubts
and questions about his
legacy and whether he
was slowly passing his
peak. Drake addressed
this when he says, “I’ve
been gone since like
July, niggas actin’ like I
died”, in his feature verse
on Blocboy JB’s ‘Look
Alive’. This track marked
the start of Drake’s 2018
assault on the charts and
he has since virtually been
an ever present in the Top
Ten, breaking the previous
record of 28 weeks at
Number One with tracks
like ‘God’s Plan’, ‘Nice
for What’ and the infec-
tious ‘In My Feelings’.
2018 seemed to be going
to plan for Drake. That is,
until Pusha T happened.
By revealing Drake’s
baby momma drama
(“YOU ARE HIDING A
CHILD!”) on his scathing
diss track ‘The Story of
Adidon’, Pusha T handed
Drake a crushing L
and effectively ruined
his otherwise immacu-
late album rollout. We
will never know what
Scorpion would have
sounded like had Drake
not taken an L but, with
the beef spawning tracks
like ‘8 Out Of 10’, ‘Mob
“YOU ARE
HIDING A
CHILD!”
Drake’s success has
garnered a hugely diverse
following, meaning that
it is almost impossible
for him to cater to all of
his fans. He has struggled
to fit his different styles
(be it R&B Drake, pop
Drake, rap Drake or
whichever iteration of
Drake you prefer) onto
one project in a way that
pleases everyone. So,
after complaining since
Take Care that Drake’s
subsequent albums have
lacked cohesion, I was
actually happy to see that
he abandoned cohesion
altogether with Scorpion
and released a double disk
album.
After an almost
flawless Side A (‘I’m
Upset’ aside), Side B dis-
appointed and proved that,
although Drake arguably
birthed their style, artists
like 6LACK and Bryson
Tiller now run the moody
trap R&B sub-genre. Like
Drake said on Nothing
Was the Same’s ‘Wu-Tang
Forever’, “it ain’t about
who did it first, it’s ‘bout
who did it right”.
On 2013’s ‘0 To 100/
The Catch Up’, Drake
says, “I been Steph Curry
with the shot”, and he
is right to liken himself
to the Golden State
Warriors’point guard. Not
just because they are both
lightskin. Steph is the best
3-point shooter in NBA
history and, similarly,
Drake is the best hit-mak-
er in hip-hop history.
However, it’s important
not to let Drake’s innate
ear for a hook distract
and to remember that,
much like how shooting
3s is only one aspect of
