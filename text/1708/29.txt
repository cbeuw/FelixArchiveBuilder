Winter Wonderland not so Wonderful
HANGMAN
Negafelix
Editor-in-Chief
T
his week Felix
can exclusively
report does not
inspire that
much wonder or is even
that wonderful. One stu-
dent was left confused
by the vast numbers of
tourists flooding in to
see something that is es-
sentially the same every
year. “What is there left
to see? You can see pho-
tos of all the shit plastic
facades anywhere on
the internet, normally
posted by some yummy
mummy that can’t quite
afford to go to Lapland.
Just use google maps
idiots.”
Anothersaid,“IfIreally
wanted the experience of
being surrounded by loads
of whiny twelve year olds,
I’d just play fortnite. The
added benefit is that I can
yeet them without any
legal consequences.”
Upon closer inspection
by this correspondent the
Wonder of Winterland
was further eroded: the
combination of cigarette
ends, traces of vomit from
over excited toddlers and
the worryingly realistic
yellow snow, significantly
lessened the induced
euphoria. This corre-
spondent wonders exactly
what kind of depraved
psychopathy could have
produced such results at
a family oriented facility:
the close proximity of
Imperial College London
and opening after dark
provide an immediate
answer.
Amongst the possible
entertainment offered at
this Wonderland of Winter
was a Santa’s grotto. It
was mildly heart-warming
for this correspondent to
watch 6ft tall Imperial
students sit on Santa’s
knee to Santa’s obvious
disappointment. A failure
of CRB checks perhaps?
Having asked a collection
of Imperial students what
they were wishing for
Christmas, one respond-
ed “a first,” the next,
“someone to love,” and the
final student, “something
to keep me going.” A poor
imitation of the Wizard of
Oz or a reflection on our
interviewees: business,
physics and mech eng
respectively.
Overall Winder
Wonterland has dis-
appointed many. Our
Russian correspondent,
Alexander Skribal pro-
vided this comprehensive
review: “Not enough
Winter Wonderland // Geograph
bears and no magnificent
Cathedral towers to climb
up.” It is understood that
in response to this, Winter
Wonderland will be up-
dating the haunted house
with the KGB experience.
Just don’t touch any of
the doorknobs. In this
correspondent’s opinion,
Wonder Winter Lander is
certainly worth the visit if
you’re prepared to accept
piss poor mulled wine,
bucks fizz that tastes like
piss and hot chocolate
with piss in it. Or it could
be baileys. One can never
be sure with baileys.

Last week you were the
universities minister.
Life comes at you fast,
and after one evening at
Imperial you decide it’s
just not worth it. Felix 1 -

Dear Felicity,
I am super unhappy.
As a vegan, I am
offended. Why does
every advertised
Christmas dinner
feature a carcass? It’s
totally inconsiderate
to me and every other
morally superior
vegan out there. Our
Felicity Felissy
Agony Aunt
Dear Vee,
Unfortunately there
is only so much you can
change your surroundings.
There is, however, more
you can do to convince
yourself things have
already changed. I under-
stand that, as a vegan, you
have designed your own
utoipa to live in and is a
great shame others aren’t
going along with it, this is
disappointing.
How about engaging
less with the wider world?
That way you can make
sure you only see what
you want to. What I could
do is make you some
blinkers, or get you a
specific map of Tesco so
you can avoid the aisles
that will offend you.
If that doesn’t work,
have you considered
moving to California?
Maybe Shoreditch?
Hope this helps!
All my love,
Felicity
xoxo

This week you start your
christmas shopping. You
buy one gift for your
cousin and about six for
yourself. Tis the season?
This week you take your
platonic companion
to winter wonderland.
You leave without your
hoodie. Cuffing season
strikes again.
This week your music is
played in the felix office.
We luv u xoxo
This week someone adds
you as a “close friend”
on instagram and you
manage to keep your
cool. Congratulations sis

This week you attempt
to get veganism declared
a religion. You succeed
in proving yourself a
pretentious cunt.
This week you book a
holiday and get ready to
start telling people you
“haven’t even packed yet
LOL!”
This week the Gast of
Christmas past comes
back to haunt you and the
FBI are hot on your heels
This week you have
some deadlines. A mix
of lack of time and poor
organisation leave you a
hysterical mess. It’s ok,
you can pass it off as the
Christmas spirit.
This week you appeal
your lab report mark. It
kicks off at least a week
of debate starting with
question to whether the
rubrik can be released.
This week you throw a
christmas party. You’re
so inconsiderate, don’t
you know how cold it is
outside? People have to
get there AND pretend
to have a good time. You
should be ashamed.
This week you’re
struggling to decide
what to get me for secret
santa, but all I want for
Christmas is EU.
sensitivities just aren’t
respected or taken
seriously.
I’m upset and
unhappy and, as a
vegan, I need you do
do something about
this. My veganism is
very important to me.
I just want to make it
supercrystalclearthat
I’m a vegan and this is
about my veganism.
Yours,
Vee Gan

Christmas cheer,
