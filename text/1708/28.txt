T
he objective of
this series, Risk
in Investment
M a n a g e m e n t
and Financial Services,
is to provide a top-level
introduction to risk in
investment management
and financial services. A
broader and wider under-
standing of different types
of risk faced in investment
management and financial
services is critical towards
our understanding of
different investment and
financial products, servic-
es and strategies adopted
in a growing risk-dynamic
environment that we are
experiencing today. The
different types of risk
include: credit risk, oper-
ational risk, market risk,
investment risk, liquidity
risk and model risk. The
aim of this article is to
focus on credit risk in
investment management
and financial services.
Credit risk is the
probable risk of loss
resulting from a
borrower’s failure to
repay a loan or meet
contractual obligations.
It is the risk of default on
a debt that arises when a
reporting plays a vital role
in credit risk management.
Three commonly used
techniques for assessing
credit risk are: credit
exposure; credit risk
premium and credit
rating. Credit exposure
measures the total amount
of credit extended to a
borrower by a lender.
The higher the credit
exposure of an investment
firm or financial firm, the
higher the likelihood of
credit default. Credit risk
premium is the return in
excess of the risk-free rate
of return on a credit-based
investment is expected to
yield. Credit risk premium
rewards an investor who
tolerates extra risk. High
risk credit-based asset
attracts a higher credit risk
premium. Credit rating is
a credit score that reflects
the likelihood of payment
by a borrower. The higher
the credit rating, the
higher the likelihood of
payment. The big three
credit rating agencies are:
Moody’s, Standard &
Poor and Fitch rating.
An effective credit risk
policy is paramount and
essential for modelling,
controlling and managing
credit risk. The key
stages of credit risk
policy development
recommended by Basel
are: development,
validation, approval,
implementation, review
and post-implementation
monitoring. Credit risk
and credit risk policy
can be effectively
managed by using: a
reliable credit scoring
system; understanding
financial, non-financial
and extraordinary
input factor to a firm;
conducting robust stress
testing, setting limits
or caps to control risk;
monitoring and tracking
key risk statistics and
key risk indicators and
continuously carrying
out internal and external
credit audit. It is important
to note that effective credit
risk mitigation is also
required. This involves
having underwriting
standards, guarantees,
credit limits, netting,
collateral, diversification,
credit derivatives, credit
default swaps, insurance
and central counterparties.
The 2008 financial
crisis remains a prime
example and a prime
reminder of credit risk
failure. There was a
high default rate in the
United States subprime
home mortgages sector
( m o r t g a g e - b a c k e d
securities). On one hand,
this was partly caused
by deregulation in the
financial industry which
led banks to execute very
risky derivates trades. On
the other hand, the credit
“Credit rating
is a credit
score that
reflects the
likelihood of
payment by
a borrower.
The higher the
credit rating,
the higher the
likelihood of
payment”
borrower fails to make
required payment. This
implies a lender does not
receive the owed principal
and interest. This leads to
a negative disruption in
the lender’s cash flows
and increases costs of debt
collection.
Three key components
of credit risk are:
counterparty risk, issuer
risk and concentration
risk. Counterparty risk
is the risk associated
with the risk that each
party of a contract will
not meet its contractual
obligations. Issuer risk is
the risk associated with
the probability of loss
resulting from the default
of the issuer of the credit.
Concentration risk is
the risk arising from the
concentration to a single
counterparty, sector,
country and/or industry.
The key issues associated
with credit risk includes:
probability of default, loss
given default, exposure
at default, recovery rates,
credit events, maturity,
wrong way risk and non-
performing credit asset.

failure was due to an
extremely large appetite
for banks to increase their
profit margin at all cost.
The result of the credit risk
failure can be highlighted
as follows:
1. Worst recession
since the Great Depression
2. House prices in
the US fell by 31.8%
3. 8.8 million jobs
lost in the US
4. $19.2 trillion lost
household wealth
5. Lehman Brothers
filed for bankruptcy
6. Global financial
systems came to its knees
The role and sound
practices of credit risk
management and credit
risk policy development
in practice is complex and
challenging. However,
continuous and iterative
credit risk management
and credit risk policy
development remains
central and critical to
the success of firms in
investment management
and financial services in
an ever growing dynamic
environment.
