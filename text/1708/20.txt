The Cat in the Hat Strikes Back!
Amateur dramatics is a powerful thing
A
t the weekend
I went home to
see my family,
and while there
saw a show from the local
youth drama club. My
sister was in it; she’ll be
going to university next
year, making this her last
performance. The show
was great fun, not exactly
Shakespeare but the
cast were having a good
time and that spirit was
infectious. At the end of
the show there was a very
tearful goodbye from all
the members leaving this
year, and it showed just
how much the club meant
to them, and how much it
still means to me.
I joined “Parsnips”
youth drama company
during year 7. The move
from primary to second-
ary school was unkind
– I wasn’t ready for the
change and friend-making
process to start again, so
I retreated into my shell.
My happiness was on a
downswing; that was until
I joined Parsnips. I knew
some of my old friends
went, but I had never
thought drama could be
for me. At the time I was
stocky and certainly not
conventionally attractive,
but more than anything I
was quiet and nervous.
But I gave it a go, and
it was the best decision
I made in my years at
school. I didn’t take to it
immediately, but seeing
my friends again was
nice and the sessions had
a compelling energy to
them. Established and run
by Claire Parsons (that’s
where the name came
from), her goal was never
to groom future stars – all
she wanted was to instil
children with the same
love of arts she had. And
it certainly worked.
It wasn’t long before I
was invested in the group.
Each week consisted
partly of dramatic exercis-
es and partly of devising
short pieces using what
we learned. I’ve never
been in a group where
everyone was so “up for
it”. As time went by it
helped me break that shell
I had hidden in. My social
comfort and confidence
improved in line with
my time in the group, but
more than that I learned
the joys of entertaining
others.
Throughout the seven
years I had with the
company I knew every
week, no matter the cir-
cumstances, I would have
two hours of happiness
and sanctuary.
Seven years moves fast,
and after many shows I
finally found myself on
that stage, saying that
tearful goodbye, better
for the experience and yet
horribly sad to see it end.
Parsnips was more than a
club, it was a family that
pushed you to be better,
with a mother who worked
unreasonable hours to
make sure you had the best
experience of your life.
And that stuck with me.
It stuck with all Parsnips,
as the row behind me
last weekend was filled
with 25-26 year olds.
The show was written by
Claire seven years ago,
and the row behind was
full of members of the
original cast, together
again from across the
country to support the
next generation.
When done right
amateur dramatics can be
a powerful thing.

Writer Samuel Welton reflects on the ability of youth theatre to inspire confidence in young people.
“She wanted to
instil children
with the same
love of arts
she had. And
it certainly
worked”
W
hen books
are made
intomovies,
fans and
critics flock like vul-
tures to tease apart the
catastrophe to come.
When the holy works of
Dr Seuss were converted
into a musical by Monty
Python’s Eric Idle, similar
scenes could be predicted.
The story tries to integrate
characters from across the
Seuss universe like The
Cat in the Hat, Horton
the Elephant, Gertrude
McFuzz and many more.
The story focuses on
Horton trying to pro-
tect the tiny planet of
Whoville, which lies on
a speck of dust, from the
inhabitants of the Jungle
of Nool. Aimed at chil-
dren, the character of Jojo
(Anna Barnes), a young
inhabitant of Whoville
with an overzealous
imagination, allows the
young audience to con-
nect to the performance.
Themes of acceptance,
bullying and loyalty are
explored with the mantra
“A person’s a person, no
matter how small” repeat-
ed throughout.
The Cat in the Hat,
played by Marc Pickering,
deservesaspecialmention
as his perfect choreog-
raphy and impeccable
comedic timing brings the
whole show together. The
way Pickering moves and
holds himself means that
despite not looking very
cat-like, the children are
fully convinced that he
is in fact The Cat in the
Hat. The costumes are
all subtle but effective
– no cheap face-painted
animals here! There are
a few instances where
Pickering performs silent
comedic scenes, a little
like Tom and Jerry. They
are seamlessly executed
and allow even the
youngest children, who
may not be following the
plot, to have a giggle.
Disappointingly, the
extremely talented Ngozi
Ugoh (portraying the Sour
Kangaroo) is given the
least solos, despite being
one of the most engaging
and fun cast members. Her
energetic dancing, sassy
mannerisms and amazing
voice give her the diva
quality that captivates the
entire audience, no matter
how small.
The plot is one problem
area. The story is unsur-
prisingly too simple for
the adults in the room
and yet too complicated
and dragged out for the
youngerchildrentofollow.
Other than breaking
into impressive dance
numbers, the disconnect-
ed performance lacks the
crafted perfection of Dr.
Seuss’s works. Horton the
Elephant, played by Scott
Paige, epitomizes all the
problems with the pro-
duction. Firstly, he is the
only character dressed in
ordinary clothes and it is
often hard to believe that
Paige is anything other
than a paid actor. Paige is
given many solos, which
were the lowest energy
parts of the performance,
a problem when the room
is full of children with
short attention spans.
These ballads are impor-
tant for moving the story
along, but, as much of the
audience is not even lis-
tening, they do not serve
their purpose. To make
things worse, these scenes
have very little in terms of
visuals: no choreography,
no colourful costumes,
nothing.
It must be said that
other than the handful of
moments where Horton
takes centre stage, the
choreography, colours and
staging are a huge strength
and, along with the fun
songs, the main selling
point of the performance.
With a small cast of only
twelve and a single set,
creative staging and
multipurpose props allow
for the scenes to come
alive. The distractions
caused by the complex
choreography also allow
actors to sneak away for
a quick costume change,
and be back before
anyone realizes they are
gone. The drastic costume
changes, along with the
distinct mannerisms of
each character, makes it
hard for adults, let alone
children, to see that the
actors are in fact the same.
This performance
is definitely aimed at
children and families and
for the most part works
perfectly for this target
audience. It was slightly
comic how many children
were scared by the over-
zealous singing of The
Cat in the Hat: tears were
shed! Fortunately, the cast
plays off any crying or
even heckling (from a 7
year old!) and, throughout
the performance, interacts
with the children, shaking
their hands, having a
quick chat and even a
little dance. Overall,
this is a high energy
performance which runs
only 75 minutes and can
be enjoyed by the whole
family.
