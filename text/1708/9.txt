And then what?
The Tory party is wrestling like Lacoön with its own ideological demons. Is this when the oldest
political edifice in the world falls?

A
t some point,
this Brexit
nonsense must
end. Reason,
though seemingly in
short supply nowadays,
demands it. Any transition
period will come to an
end. Any backstop will
be withdrawn from and a
new norm for the country
will arrive, however
uneasily. The question is
whether this new norm
will arrive for the Tories.
Once known for their
ruthless pragmatism the
Conservative party has
served as the ‘safe pair of
hands’ ever since Disraeli.
His phrase ‘One nation
conservatism’, meant the
protection of all classes
through measures to
reduce class differences
and improve the lot of
the common man through
sensible, paternalistic
policy that is at its heart
non-ideological. This
manifested itself most
strongly in support for
Labour’s National Health
Service and the Welfare
state. This support was not
just an electoral necessity
but instead an alignment
of ideology characteristic
of the post-war consensus,
the period between 1945
and Thatcher defined by
nationalisation, strong
trade unions, strong reg-
ulation, high taxes, and
a generous welfare state.
Universities were built,
a national curriculum
devised and economic
integration with Europe
and the capitalist world
was encouraged. The state
was recognised as being
vital to maintaining a
functioning society and a
mixed economy was the
norm.
Then in the 70’s with
Friedman, the Laffer
curve and Thatcher, the
Tory party made a sudden
about turn. Suddenly,
the old Keynesian
attitude that government
intervention to inject
money into an economy
was necessary to fight a
recession was cast out
and the country changed
as a result. The message
became one of tax cuts
and money trickling
down. Thatcher worked
hard to cut and scrimp and
save and young Tories
coming up the ranks at the
time took her message to
heart, gold plated it and
made of it an ideology. To
them regulation was re-
strictive, tariffs abhorrent
and quotas the work of
hell, meant only to stifle
an economy. This, not
anger over loss of control,
fuels the Hard Brex-
iteers of the Economic
Research Group (ERG)
Reese-Moggs’ personal
mouthpiece. The belief
that once freed from the
shackles of super-gov-
ernmental control, Britain
will be able to become a
new Singapore, a haven
for international business.
I personally don’t think
that it is likely. When par-
roting the fact that Britain
is the world’s fifth largest
economy, the ERG forgets
what the world in fact
looks like. Both the US
and China have the might
to demand such conces-
sions from Britain that any
agreement would likely
look more like patronage
rather than partnership.
Japan may be won around
but Germany will certain-
ly not. This leaves Britain
scrabbling around to form
a patchwork of deals with
countries smaller and less
significant than itself.
I do not believe that
Brexit will deliver an
economic bounty and
neither does the House
of Commons Exiting
the European Union
Committee. This will be
punished by voters. I hate
to be the one to say ‘It’s
the economy stupid’ but
it is in fact the economy.
Stooopid.
The only way that
the Tories can hope to
remain a relevant political
force is to acknowledge
the mistakes that they
have made and to regain
the centre ground that
they seceded. Voters are
worried about Corbyn
in when standards fall.
Education is the best way
of
levelling the socio-eco-
nomic playing field.
Success will be when
private schools close
because parents recognise
the world class level of
our state system; rail
nationalisation and the
building of a trans-Pen-
nine service. If Brexit
brings with it a compul-
sory period of withdrawal
from the world stage then
rather than focusing on
London, money must be
found to balance out the
North-South divide. A
recent study has found
that the North has suffered
a brain drain going back
200 years. This is unac-
ceptable and could be
challenged by supporting
urban regeneration and
house building schemes
in Northern cities; an
expansion of social care
to include prevention of
diseases such as obesity
and cardiovascular disease
and geriatric care. These
are time bombs that have
been shamefully ignored
in the name of individual
freedom and must be acted
against; Finally, Britain
must act independently
of America on the world
stage, projecting power
via the Royal Navy and
building a new consensus
of how a major economy
can take care of its people.
These are the values
that must be regained if
the Tories hope to remain
relevant and why I despite
setbacks call myself a
(small c) conservative.

“Any
agreement
with China
and the US
would be
patronage not
partnership”
and his ability to lead the
country but his message,
however garbled and
unclear, resonates. People
want to feel that the
government stands with
them against exploitative
businesses not against
them. Citizens of this
country have the right to
be protected, not preached
to about how, in the long
term, cutting and austerity
will bring them greater
fortune.
A new ‘one nation’
policy platform might
look something like this;
a massive investment
of money into schools
nationwide. The bringing
of academies under far
closer government control
and being quicker to move
