uper Smash Bros.
Ultimate is the
latest entry into the
Super Smash Bros.
video game series. This
franchise made its debut
in 1998 on the Nintendo
64 and has appeared on
every Nintendo home
console since: with Melee
on the Gamecube, Brawl
on the Wii and SSB4 on
the Wii U and N3DS.
For those who do not
know, the Super Smash
Bros series is a massive
crossover Nintendo
fighting game that features
your favourite characters
from a whole range of
Nintendo franchises to
3rd party characters from
other iconic video game
series.
Who’s here?
Everyone is here!
SSBU brings back every
character who has made
a playable appearance in
the franchise so far – so
Solid Snake and Ice
Climbers who were cut
in SSB4 are now back on
the roster. Moreover, we
now have echo fighters
(clones), which allow new
characters to be brought
into smash. These echo
fighters play similarly to
existing characters with
different appearances.
Returning characters who
have been rebranded as
echo fighters include
Lucina (Marth) and Dark
Pit (Pit).
Additionally, Sakurai
has brought some iconic
newcomers such as the
famous Inklings from
Splatoon and the guy that
everyone thought was too
big for Smash – Ridley.
King K Rool from the
Donkey Kong series
makes his debut alongside
Castlevania’s Simon
Belmont (Richter will be
his echo fighter). Speaking
of echo fighters, Princess
Daisy, Fire Emblem’s
Chrom, Dark Samus and
Street Fighter’s Ken will
be making their playable
Smash debuts as echo
fighters Peach, Roy,
Samus and Ryu respec-
tively. Isabelle will have
her own moveset and will
not be an echo fighter of
the Villager. So many new
characters! But that’s still
not everyone. Incineroar
from Pokemon Sun and
Moon and Piranha Plant
will also be playable char-
acters – though Piranha
Plant is a pre-order bonus.
Excited? Well, there’s
going to be at least five
more characters released
in the upcoming DLC
packs, so the fighters will
With new characters
also comes new game
modes.
Smashdown is a mode
where your previously
selected character
becomes unavailable
for the next round. This
means players have to
learn to adapt and cannot
just rely on their main.
Squad Strike can be
played as either a 3-on-3
or a 5-on-5 elimination
battle. Players will cycle
through their fighters con-
secutively until a winner
is determined.
The training mode
in Ultimate is new and
improved, now with
launch distance and tra-
jectory displayed.
World of Light
It’s been almost ten
years since the Smash
series had a proper story
mode. The Subspace
Emissary in Brawl was an
interesting way to engage
players and make them
connect to the characters.
The cinematic cutscenes
added depth and an extra
dimension to the Smash
Bros experience. It was
also a great way of un-
locking characters, as you
added them to your party
during the story.
Now ten years on
we have the World of
Light, which Sakurai and
Nintendo are keeping
under complete wraps.
What we do now so far is
that there is a new villain,
Galeem, only Kirby
manages to escape his
attack on all the fighters.
You now take control of
Kirby as you navigate
the World of Light to find
your friends (both fighters
and spirits) and discover
the mysteries of this
world.
Similar to Brawl, you’ll
unlock the majority of the
characters in the story
mode.
What are these
Spirits?
There has been a
mention of spirits, but
what exactly are these
spirits and how do they
impact the game?
Spirits are game
characters which can be
equipped to your fighter to
boost their stats in a battle.
There are two categories
of spirits, Primary and
Support. Primary spirits
raise the attack power of
your fighter and come in
three types: Attack, Grab,
Shield. Like rock, paper
and scissors, the types
have advantages over
each other: attack beats
grab which beats shield
which beats attack. So
make sure to choose your
spirit well.
Gameplay
Melee (and Project M)
fans rejoice! The fighting
mechanics in Ultimate
will be tailored towards
the gameplay that made
melee popular. Picking
which direction you can
dodge mid-air is now back
to allow you to quickly
avoid enemy attacks.
Don’t be over-reliant on
dodges though; overusing
them will reduce their
effectiveness over time.
Super Smash Bros
Ultimate is available
now (as of Friday 7th
December 2018) on the
Nintendo Switch.
Everyone is here and here is everything you should know.

just keep coming. Given
the shocking DLC char-
acters for SSB4, no one
can predict which fighters
will be joining the Smash
roster over the next few
years.
P l a y a b l e
Waluigi?
Despite some dreams
coming true (Ridley fans
can finally wipe their
tears), Waluigi will be
making an appearance
in Super Smash Bros
Ultimate – as an assist
trophy.
