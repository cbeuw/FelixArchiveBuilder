Imperial’s albums of the year, 2018
We asked, you delivered. This year at Felix we decided that rather than a conventional top-ten, we’d take a bunch
of submissions from you, the people. And so here are, in no particular order, Imperial’s albums of the year 2018.

Everything Is Love
The Carters
It’s a piece of a Jean-
Michel state of mind, with
Mona Lisa right behind.
Embedded in a celebra-
tion of black love we are
given the final piece to a
love story that started with
Beyoncé’s Lemonade and
JAY-Z’s 4:44. Assembling
succinctly as The Carters
we see the world’s biggest
power couple revel in
their extravagance as
they detail a memoir
of their marriage. This
masterpiece truly lives as
a musical manifestation of
their cultural sovereignty.
- Alex Mitcham
High As Hope
Florence and the Ma-
chine
What is Florence and
the Machine if not grand?
The theatre of their albums
is something listeners
have come to love and
expect. In that sense, this
album serves as another
step along a well-estab-
lished path of the band’s
passionate and elegant
method. Having said that,
it would be a great shame
to overlook the quieter,
less familiar beauty this
album radiates. Florence’s
lyrics and vocals have
always guided the band’s
instrumentation. The
especially daring, layered
yet assured soundscapes
presented here therefore
make perfect sense.Where
Florence’s openness has
previously been an act of
wearing her heart on her
sleeve, this time, though
equally thorough, immer-
sive and lush, she gives
us more by giving us less.
That is to say, as well as
her soul, she lets us hear
her conscious dialogue
with her soul, unaltered
and unfiltered. Don’t
mistake this for subtle or
new: High As Hope is a
sentimental optimist who
you love, breaking down
and proving to you that,
beneath a thin but taut
layer, they have always
been just as self-aware,
introspective and nuanced
as you suspected. Being
boldly timid without apol-
ogising for an innate hope
and doing it flawlessly is
what makes this album.
- Asad Raja
I’m All Ears
Let’s Eat Grandma
The second studio
album from Let’s eat
Grandma, a duo of preco-
cious teenage girls from
Norwich, runs the whole
gamut of electro pop/
rock. From the SOPHIE
produced mechanised
chaos of lead single ‘Hot
Pink’, which gleefully
plays both with concepts
of femininity and chain-
sawesque synths, to
the epic eleven minute
closer ‘Donnie Darko’,
this album is a kaleido-
scopic gem. Indeed, the
wondrously coruscating
production throughout,
coupled with the piercing-
ly emotive lyrics makes
this easily my favourite
release of the year.
- Josh D’aeth
Iridescence
Brockhampton
After a turbulent year
forthe“bestboybandsince
one direction”, including
the loss of a key member
and a multi-million dollar
record deal, Brockhamp-
ton finally delivered
Iridescence. Packed with
industrial-tinged bangers
and shapeshifting, intro-
spective gems, this album
packs a serious punch.
Production veers from
visceral to glistening
instantaneously, often
both at once. By far the
strangest album to top
billboard this year.
- Miles Gulliford
Honey
Robyn
In the eight years
since Robyn released her
seminal album Body Talk,
her music has become
something of a template
for an entire generation
of pop-writers. With their
four-to-the-floor beats,
catchy hooks, and emo-
tionally-insightful lyrics,
singles like ‘Dancing
on my Own’ helped
birth a new era of music
appropriate for both the
club and crying in your
bedroom.
The expectation
for follow-up Honey,
therefore, was sky high.
But Robyn delivered.
She did so not, as many
presumed, by continuing
with the icy synth-pop of
Body Talk, but instead by
introducing a new warmth
into her sound, while
paying tribute to the club
culture in which she has
immersed herself.
Coming off the death
of a close friend and the
breakup of a long-term
relationship, Honey acts
as an aural balm, soothing
our wounds while retain-
ing a melancholy depth.
While there is a clear
link to her previous work,
Honey marks Robyn out
as a modern pop icono-
clast, breaking out of a
blueprint she created.
- Fred Fyles
Twin Fantasy
Car Seat Headrest
While it may be a
remake of the 2011 lo-fi
original, the explosive
reworking of this coming
of age story make it
enough of a new album
to be included on this list.
Angsty yet assertive, the
album’s narrator details
his hopeless longing for
a nameless man who
he recognises he can’t
be with. It’s a tale of
what-could-have-been-
but-never-quite-was, told
through both wit and
sorrow. It’s musically
dense, spanning classic
indie rock instrumentals
and screamed choruses,
through to phase-shifted
spoken word sound-
scapes, all drenched in
Will Toledo’s signature
anecdotal charm.

a door and bawl your eyes
out in consecutive tracks.
A humorous, well-crafted
release, Joy as an Act of
Resistance is the perfect
antidote to the depressing
political landscape of
2018.
- Joe O’connell-Danes
Odyssey
Take That
Almost 30 years-worth
of banging tunes and
many, many memories;
five working class men
with the ambition and de-
termination to work super
hard for success; great
motivation in the morning
to face the day and escape
on the way home. Though
I do have restrain myself
from performing the well-
known dance moves on
the Piccadilly line home!
- Catrin Davies
White Is Relic/
Irrealis Mood
Of Montreal
Of Montreal’s fifteenth
studio album White Is
Relic/Irrealis Mood is
a paranoid electronic
spin on the band’s usual
work. It brings the focus
on social commentary
we have come to expect
from the band’s lead
Kevin Barnes, who sings
in disbelief about the state
of the world, citing social
critics James Baldwin
and Noam Chomsky as
influences.
Barnes, in shock at the
state of late capitalism
and in anger at “toxic
American White identity”,
suggests reality really
exists inside a simulation:
in ‘Plateau Phase/No Ca-
reerism No Corruption’he
sings “If we put our ear to
the ceiling / we can hear
the government breathing
/ […] we can hear the
simulation wheezing.”
His sharp anxiety soaks
the complex lyrics in a
pulsing drumbeat and
elaborate instrumentals.
This is perhaps one of the
least accessible albums
from the group, but its
more electronic focus
represents a new direction
for them, and one I look
forward to hearing more
of.
- Josef Willsher
Bark Your Head
Off, Dog
Hop Along
This album is 40
minutes of indie rock
bliss. Every single song
is gorgeous, catchy, and
beautifully written. There
are more incredible hooks
than I know what to do
with; some songs even
have more than one. It
sounds wistful, big-heart-
ed and romantic, with
vocals and lyrics that are
so heartfelt you can’t help
but be captivated.

Now Only
Mount Eerie
Phil Elverum aka
Mount Eerie follows up
on last year’s tragic A
Crow Looked At Me, with
a slightly sweeter, more
free-form collection of
songs, he leads us through
the twists and turns of
his life in the wake of his
wife’s tragic death. While
the instrumentals and
vocals are fragile at times,
Phil shows us again that
dwelling on mortality and
the fragility of life is what
he does best.
- Miles Gulliford
Little Dark Age
MGMT
MGMT’s Little Dark
Age is their strongest
release to date. That said,
while it is a good, possibly
even great, album, I was
hesitant about whether it
was album-of-the-year-
worthy. But looking back
on 2018, it is the best
album that my unasham-
edly ignorant ears came
across this year. The title
track is an undeniable
banger with its goth-
synth-pop sound, and the
musical and lyrical quirks
throughout the record
make for an engaging and
amusing listen, especially
on tracks ‘She Works
Out Too Much’, ’When
You Die’ and ‘TSLAMP’
(Time Spent Looking At
My Phone). One can’t
help but feel that MGMT
have gleefully adopted a
post-ironic stance on this
album, and in my book
that beats chart-oriented
pop any day. LDA might
not objectively be 2018’s
best album, but as of now
for me it is.
- Neel Le Penru
E.MO.TION
Carly Rae Jepsen
them reach new heights as
they continue to construct
addictive melodies with
clever, emotive lyrics. The
album asks the question: is
love dead? And explores
themes surrounding it.
In ‘Graves’, lead singer
Lauren Mayberry, croons:
“Leaving bodies in stair-
wells and washing up on
shores”. This is a clear
allusion to the tragedies
that occurred in Grenfell
as well as the current
refugee crisis. Other
songs explore the theme
in terms of relationships
and friendships, but each
one can be enjoyed for its
melody and its meaning.
- Eamon Akil Farhat
Joy As An Act Of
Resistance
IDLES
Following on from
their eccentric first album,
Idles dropped a punchy
post-punk project for
Brexit Britain. Politically
charged from start to
finish, Joy as an Act
of Resistance tackles
everything from male
suicide rates to immigra-
tion, all with smirking
lyrical flair. With produc-
tion to back-up the sharp
lyricism, the album can
make you want to kick in
Time ‘n’ Place
Kero Kero Bonito
On their debut LP
Bonito Generation,
KKB showcased their
infectious brand of dance-
pop filled with ebullient
melodies and childlike
lyricism. Despite this
leading to quite the cult
following, with Time
‘n’ Place they shed the
computer-based beats
and Japanese rapping in
favour of noisy guitars
and poignant lyrical
subjects. What results is
a fleshed-out, dreamy,
nostalgic indie rock mas-
terpiece which maintains
the youthful optimism of
their roots.
- Eren Akademir
Love Is Dead
CHVRCHES
CHVRCHES’ third
album Love Is Dead sees
Well, she’s done it
again folks. It may be hard
to believe, but Ms. Carly
Rae Jepsen – queen of
modern pop, master of the
break-up ballad, Canada’s
number one producer of
sad bops (sorry Drake)
– has yet again obtained
the top spot in this year’s
album listings with E.MO.
TION.
‘But wait!’ I hear you
cry, ‘wasn’t E.MO.TION,
Ms Jepsen’s wig-snatch-
ing, banger-stuffed, epic-
for-our-times actually
released in 2015?’ Yes,
dear reader, you are indeed
correct. But until another
artist releases anything
remotely era-defining as
E.MO.TION I refuse to
make Carly give up her
throne. I mean, have you
even listened to ‘Boy
Problems’? I rest my case.
