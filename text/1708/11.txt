I started a Summer social project!
H
ey, what are
you going to do
for the summer
man? Intern?
Which company have
you applied for?” As we
creep towards the end of
second term, that’s the
question to ask whenever
you meet another fellow
high-achieving acquaint-
ance of yours at Imperial,
isn’t it? For my first and
second year at university,
the peer pressure never
got to me. I backpacked,
travelled and spent some
quality family time during
summers. Third year was
a different story, like
many others, I applied for
companies that interest
me, refined my CV, wrote
cover letters, etc. But,
unlike many others, I had
zero offers back and that
hit me hard. For a short
while.
I decided to take a break
from all the corporate
pressure and coursework,
I went to my aunt’s place
in London for a refreshing
weekend. During that
time, my mind was clear
enough to ponder what I
really wanted to do, soon
followed by a moment
of excitement when I
concluded that I would
start a summer social
project. Something new,
something impactful, it
was a mixed feeling of
excitement and confusion
as I also had no idea of
how I would approach this
challenge. The plan, the
execution, the end goal,
everything was a blur
other than the location.
It needed to be Genting
Village, Tioman Island in
Malaysia; where I spent
my last two summers
working as a tour guide.
All I could remember from
the times were flashbacks
of locals openly burning
their garbage and causing
pollution. Surely there’s
some waste management
problem to be fixed, right?
It was May 2018, sup-
posedly my project wass
going to start in August
2018. Things got slow
after that weekend, after
that initial rush of adren-
aline. I knew majority of
the work would be done
on-site, but procrastina-
tion was real. I would
put the project at the top
of my to-do-list and I’d
still do nothing. The only
tasks I accomplished
within that three months’
gap was a 6-hour reading
into the general waste
management system and
getting a logo done by
my friend). The rationale
behind that was, once
I publicise the logo on
social media, telling the
world about my summer
social project, there’s no
turning back. The public
is my invigilator.
It’s 1st
August 2018 and
I’ve just landed in Genting
Village, Tioman Island,
after a gruesome 9-hour
bus ride plus a 2-hour ferry
ride. In the beginning few
days, I was uneasy about
everything. What if there
is not a problem for me to
solve? What if the locals
despise my project? What
if I fail? The moment
I stopped asking those
“What If” questions was
the time that I got to work.
Roadblock number one –
psychological problems.
I started by talking to the
locals about my project.
The government cleaning
worker, the guys that
played volleyball, the
resort owner, the son of
the head of village, the
bride of the son of the
head of village. I was
talking to everyone. Out
of the people I met and
talked to, many of them
ended up playing a big
role in my project.
The first relevant guy I
met was Alvin, where we
met in another village on
the island. We met online
after I found a 4 year old
blog written by Alvin
about implementing recy-
cling policy on the island.
Alvin was brilliant, he
was friendly and he told
me about the whole story
of them coming about
increasing the recycling
percentage of the village,
how and why they design
they recycling bin this
way, etc. I took Alvin’s
advice and was thinking
of doing it in Genting
Village. Two or three days
later, I met roadblock
number two – funding.
What Alvin did was only
possible with some grants.
However, what Alvin
gave me was something
more influential, my first
hope and confidence that
things can be done on this
island if you believe in it.
Alvin soon introduced
me to Hisyam, a crazy
dude that lives in a hut by
the beach, does in-house
recycling for Alvin’s
village, and organises
surfing competitions for
Red Bull during monsoon
season. Red Bull, mate,
Red Bull. I must meet the
guy. Hisyam was really
talkative, and when he
heard about my initiative,
he was very supportive
and started throwing me
ideas and promised me his
help. I was very thankful
for his support and his
ideas were solid and prac-
tical.
Soon after I met
Hisyam, I met Z, a resort
owner from Genting
Village. Z is a passionate
guy when it comes to
environmental sustaina-
bility. A couple years ago,
Z tried to start a recycling
movement in the village
but his lone effort was
sadly ignored. He saw my
arrival as an indication
for him to restart his old
project and make some-
thing happen. Two hours
into our first meeting, over
a cup of tea, we’d become

partners for the project.
Just like that. Finally, one
thing that was happening
in my favour.
Two weeks into the
project, I realised I was
rushing. I was taking in
ideas from people and
wanting to do it all. At the
time, I was still doubting
myself a lot. Adding onto
that is the pressure of not
completing the project in
time. Perfect cocktail for
a morning anxiety attack.
I made the rational choice
and took a day-off. A day
where I slept till noon
and had nothing on my
mind other than chilling.
After the well-rested day,
I started from scratch and
drew out a ‘big picture’
map of the waste route
of the village. Generally,
waste from businesses
and locals are gathered
at one location and get
sent to the incinerator
in another village. In
the words of Alvin and
Hisyam, the incineration
procedure is “not done
properly”, causing air
and water pollution to the
surrounding ecosystem.

An unconventional way to spend your Summer
First meeting with Alvin // Yan Kai Kee
was the right decision as
now the goal was clear
– try and get as many
recyclables to be sent to
the in-house recycling
centre of Hisyam. Killing
two birds with one stone;
not only will that increase
the recycling awareness
of the village, at the same
time it indirectly reduces
the pollution, with less
waste being sent to the
main facilities.
Proposing that simple
solution to Hisyam and
Z, the logistical route of
recyclables was easily
laid out as three of us had
a meeting over a cup of
tea. Z being the passionate
local decided to allocate
some space in his resort
for recyclables collection,
before being sent out
to Hisyam’s recycling
house. With that, we met
roadblock number three –
the lack of local support.
How are we going to
motivate the business and

locals of Genting Village
to recycle? Rather than
thinking far ahead, we
figure the first step would
be informing them about
the new recycling route
that’ll benefit our environ-
ment i.e. raising aware-
ness. We came out with
many ideas like volleyball
competitions and cleaning
sessions but settled on a
door-to-door campaign
where a group of us would
gather one morning and
walk the entire village (12
resorts and 120 locals),
telling everyone about the
good news.
During the campaign
day, we manage to gather
around ten passionate
volunteers (mainly divers
because everyone knows
how much they love the
environment) and began
our six-hour campaign.
Knocking on people’s
doors with a hand-drawn
map, we started talking
passionately about the
new route that will help
protect our environment
even more. The response
we got? Some remark-
able, some remained
neutral and some straight
up ignored our message.
Anyway, we got the
message across and even
sparked some healthy
discussions about how
we can help protect the
beautiful environment of
the island better. One con-
versation with a Chinese
chef stuck with me. His
approach towards food
waste? Let the monitor
lizard on the island eat
them. His also raised
another problem about
openly burning polyfoam,
as that’s the only material
that can allow him to bring
fresh seafood in from the
mainland. Perhaps my
next project can focus on
that? (GWWet a real job
Kai)
Two days after the
campaign is where I
ended my own journey.
After the project, I went
back to my hometown
to spend some time
with my family before
heading back to the UK
for my final year. I rarely
contact Z, Hisyam and
Alvin anymore as other
priorities start creeping
into my life (job applica-
tions *cough *cough). All
in all, the entire project
was not straightforward,
if anything, the whole
process was filled with
curveballs, sharp turns,
stagnant procrastination,
twist and spikes. However,
this is what makes the
project worth remember-
ing. Five, ten years down
the road, you ain’t going
to remember the smooth
sails in life but rather the
hardship and people you
met as you struggle and
stumble across challeng-
es. Be brave enough to
take the first step, and let
the world guide you to
your next destination.
