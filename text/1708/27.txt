was a typical
evening. Some were
rounding off their CV’s
with society activities,
others were sweating it
out in ethos, and many a
student could be found in
the library, studying hard
for the approaching end
of term deadlines. These
students were oblivious to
the epic showdown, taking
place in the Royal School
of Mines, to answer an
important and controver-

or Earth Science and
Engineering?

to their department’s
success, however the
single highest scoring
team had also been
promised a lucrative
chocolate-based prize.
The stakes were high.
Yet, despite the extreme
importance of the event’s
outcome, spirits were high
and the mood was jovial.
Students, post-grads and
staff were united by a
common goal and fun was
had by all. The only thing
missing was sufficient

required to fuel the

The quiz proceeded as

1. Imperial Knowledge
2. History
3. Science
4. Pop Culture
5. International Geog-
raphy
6. Sport
7. Literature
8. Technology
