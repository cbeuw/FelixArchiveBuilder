T
here are five
stages of grief:
denial, anger,
bargaining, de-
pression and acceptance.
We as a country have
finally gotten near the end
of our Brexit grief. First
there was the denial that
we as a country would ever
vote for such a preposter-
ous idea. Then there was
anger as it became appar-
ent our country was much
more divided than we had
thought and that Brexit
was now a reality. Next
came the long bargaining
with the EU, to come up
with a deal while still
reassuring ourselves that
everything would be ok.
A government report that
came out last week hints
to the next stage: depres-
sion, the chancellor Philip
Hammond saying the
country would be worse
“in pure economic terms”.
If this metaphor continues
to holds true, the next
stage is acceptance. We
as a country, both re-
mainers and leavers, will
learn to accept what has
happened and move on.
With an important vote
taking place on the 11th
of December, it is finally
time to accept May’s
Brexit as the possibility of
a revote is negligible and
the prospect of a no deal
is disastrous.
There are logical
reasons why a people’s
vote is not viable, but
the common argument
that such a vote would
undermine the will of the
British people is not the
one being made here. A
democratic vote that could
be undemocratic is as ox-
ymoronic as a strong and
stable government under
Theresa May. Unfortu-
nately despite support by
MPs as well as an alleged
700,000 protestors in
London, as long as the
conservative government
is in power, there is no
chance of this vote. The
cross party campaign for
a people’s vote is a true
thing of beauty. It spreads
hope and tries to redefine
how to spread a political
message after the dirty
campaign fought back in
2016.
Unfortunately, cam-
paigning for something
that will never happen is
a simple waste of great
minds and resources.
The campaign for a
people’s vote in some
ways is like the LGBT
movement or the Suffra-
gettes: a massive fight
for basic rights (freedom
of movement, etc) which
defines what type of
country we are. There is
one important distinction
with the aforementioned
historic movements: the
people’s vote has a time
limit, Brexit. Looking
practically there is no time
for a people’s vote to take
place. The preparations,
legislation and political
coordination take longer
than the 4 months left until
Brexit day. Sure, an ex-
tension could be granted
but that would be at the
discretion of the European
Council and would just
add more uncertainty, a
commodity that is not
lacking. Overall, unless
circumstances change
drastically, such as a new
of government, a people’s
vote is unlikely.
Even if we accept that
Brexit will go ahead, and
that a people’s vote won’t
happen, many still believe
an alternate version of
Brexit is possible. In
fact, never before have
so many MPs, from every
corner of the commons,
we would probably get
a few cheap fairy lights
instead. Now, 30 months
later, reality has struck
and what we have is a
reasonable compromise.
Unfortunately, it will
most probably not get the
support of parliament and
thus the country will be
thrust into another period
of uncertainty as May
goes back to renegotiate.
Other that a few small
concessions from the EU,
the deal will not change
drastically and thus will
potentially never get
through parliament. With
no clear alternative the
future has never seemed
so unsure. As many
fret about the economic
damage that Brexit could
cause, they do not consider
the damage caused by
this uncertainty. What
the country needs more
Theresa May has definitely looked funnier than this// Flickr
“This deal,
even after
renegotiation,
will likely
never make
it through
parliament”
united against May’s deal.
Whether it be a harder or
softer Brexit, everyone
thinks they can do it better
and yet no one has the
details to back that up.You
can’t remove the backstop
when there is a possibility
of a hard Northern Irish
border.. You can’t end free
movement of people while
retaining the economic
perks. The EU has made
their position very clear
on these issues for almost
2 years and no backbench
Tory MP will change that.
While we were
promised the stars and
the moons when the
negotiations began, it
quickly became clear that
than ever is to be sure of
what is to come, whatever
it might be. What the
country needs is a strong
and stable government
which will implement
Brexit and mitigate the
consequences. If the
government cannot do
this and the uncertainty
continues then maybe it is
time for a change, or is it
too late?
