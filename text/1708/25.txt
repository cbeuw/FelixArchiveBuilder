Supervision Story

T
he quality of PhD
supervision is
becoming a hot
topic, not only
at Imperial College but
across the whole UK.
Decision-makers across
Imperial College are
becoming increasingly
aware that the quality of
supervision is the major
predictor of satisfaction
and wellbeing of any
PhD student. Together
with the Imperial College
Union, the College ad-
ministration works hard in
improving the supervision
and the welfare system for
students with problems.
There are many excel-
lent supervisor-student
relationships across
Imperial College, where
the mutual expectations
as recommended by the
Graduate School, are ful-
filled by both parties. But
sometimes, over the long
duration of a research
project, these relation-
ships can collapse and
cause stress and mental
health issues. Severe cases
of bullying and sexual
harassment continue
happening at most British
academic institutions, as
frequently reported by
The Guardian.
Together with Felix,
the Graduate Student
Union (GSU) is creating
a platform where supervi-
sion stories can be shared
anonymously. Show
others how supervision
can work well. Tell the
story of how you found
support in the College
pastoral system when you
had a problem. Or help
us to point out where the
system failed to give the
response you wished for,
or where fear and frustra-
tion stop you from taking
action.
The GSU will make
sure that your stories are
published fully anony-
mously and deperson-
alised in Felix. Once a
month, Felix will publish
two diverse supervision
stories. Be one of the first
to share yours and help
the GSU in making the
systemic improvements
our students need.
Submit your 300-400
word story to the GSU
via Google form to be
accessed only by the GSU
president.
M
y experience
as a post-
g r a d u a t e
r e s e a r c h
student at Imperial was in
complete contrast to my
expectations.
remember having to force
another co-student who
was in tears out of the
bathroom to do an exper-
iment which required two
people, because I was too
afraid to not complete the
task. They were in tears
because they were so
frightened of making a
mistake and of what the
supervisor would say if
they did so.
Collaboration, sharing
of ideas and discussion
was virtually non-existent.
I was not encouraged to
offer up alternative points
of view, and upon using
peer-reviewed reports
to question and critique
previously generated data
from or methodologies of
the laboratory, received
verbal attacks of such
ferocity I became afraid
to speak at all. At no
point during my time at
Imperial was I welcomed
into lab meetings. Indeed;
the groups I worked with
didn’t seem to have them.
I was ridiculed for asking
questions which, judging
frommyacademicinterac-
tions prior to and after my
studies at Imperial, were
perfectly reasonable, valid
and part of the learning
process. I increasingly
felt that Imperial students
were required to be ‘seen
and not heard’. I have
been afraid to speak out
because of the reputation
of the institution and
the fear that I would be
compromising my future
academic career.

“Together with

“My
experience as
a postgraduate
research
student at
Imperial was
in complete
contrast to my
expectations”
“I was quickly
astounded by
the lack of care
for student
wellbeing and
happiness”
“Over my time
at Imperial,
I became so
frightened of
my supervisor
that I used to
be sick before
and after
supervisor
meetings”
“During
my time at
Imperial, I
believe that
I became
a worse
scientist”
A diligent and hard-
working student, I was
accustomed to high-level
problem solving, difficult
tasks, proposing and
defending arguments and
manipulating complex
data and ideas. Eager
for the challenge that I
believed lay before me, I
was quickly astounded at
the lack of care for student
wellbeing and happiness.
Over my time at Imperial,
I became so frightened of
my supervisor that I used
to be sick before and after
supervisory meetings: a
presentation of anxiety
which has continued since
leaving the College along
with vivid ‘flashbacks’
of my experiences. I
also had to hide my tears
from other post-docs and
researchers in the depart-
ment. To my shame, I
I was told I “didn’t use
my brain”, was “lazy” and
that “you women don’t
think for yourselves”. At
this point I was working
80-hour weeks, and barely
eating or sleeping. I’d
regularly get home after
23:30, work until 02:00
and be commuting again
by 07:30. Despite this,
I was criticised for not
being a dedicated enough
scientist and didn’t
love what I was doing
enough. During my time
at Imperial, I believe that
I became a worse scientist
not a better one.
Whilst at the College,
pastoral support was
limited, and I did not
feel there was anyone I
could turn to; when I tried
to raise my concerns, I
was made to feel like a
nuisance and like it was
my fault for having diffi-
culties because I wasn’t
good enough to be at the
College.
“Pastoral
support was
limited... I did
not feel there
was anyone I
could turn to”
Since leaving Imperial,
I have tried to access the
complaints procedure via
student support so that
no other student should
have a similar experience
to me, but the thought of
being identified to my
supervisor is so terrifying
that I have not followed
through on the formal
process.

Graduate Students’ Union hosts Hammersmith Event

I m p e r i a l
College Union
andtheGraduateStudents’
Union (GSU) teamed up
with Feast Bar, located
close to the Hammersmith
and White City campuses
of Imperial College to
throw a fabulous social
for postgraduate students
located in the area. The
event itself lured students
with some exclusive
deals, including 50% off
all food and drinks for any
student showing a valid
Imperial College Card.
Representatives from the
SU and GSU also attend-
ed and provided some free
drinks for students.
age more of a community
feel at these locations,
especially following the
move of the Chemistry
Department to White City.
The event was a
success, attracting many
students with the large
selection of good food
and drinks available under
this offer. However, it was
noted that more events
like this need to happen
in order to attract a greater
attendance. Hannah
Jones, the GSU Event’s
Officer commented, “we
need more events which
are exclusive to post-
graduate students at these
campuses and that also
bring together students
from South Kensington,
to allow the feeling that
we are one University and
not separated by location.
My team at the GSU and
I are in the process of
organising more events
of this kind with more
networking to bring more
of a community feeling. I
welcome any suggestions
from students who have
ideas for future events.”
It is hoped another
collaboration deal with
Feast Bar will be set up in
the future. To get in touch
with the GSU Events
Team with any feedback,
comments or suggestions,
