S
ick of the Jingle
Bells and the
Christmas lights?
Tired of fake
white beards and elven
tights? Well you are
in luck my mates, for
The Nightmare Before
Christmas awaits. From
the inexplicable mind of
Tim Burton, this is a story
about Jack Skellington,
who became weary of
hosting Halloweens, and
instead wanted to deco-
rate Christmas trees; who
became a castaway, for
his desire to celebrate the
Christmas holiday.
From the ghouls and
witches, to the skulls and
stitches,creativityisfound
in every creature. Gro-
tesque and eerie, without
being gross and creepy,
this film is the antithesis
of a Christmas feature.
Yet its final celebration of
love and heroism would
be considered the perfect
Christmas message by
some. Of course this film
is impossible without

Children of Men
An Alternative Christ-
mas Flick
A
week into
December and
all the frivolous
c o n s u m e r i s t
tosh brings out the cynic
in the best of us. You’re
already overloaded with
sickly sweet festivi-
ty— all that Christmas
cheer can leave you with
heartburn. Tis the season
to binge on Love Actually
and Home Alone, even
though you’ve probably
watched both at least
twice this year already.
Rather than scouting for
a sub-par flick that’ll
“just about do” for your
next night in, switching
channels like spinning the
barrel of a revolver for a
game of Russian roulette,
you’d best hear me out on
an alternative ‘Christmas’
gem.
Children of Men is
directed by Alfonso
Cuaron, based on the
book of the same name
by P.D. James. It is set
in 2027, when the world
faces an infertility crisis
that leaves civilisation
in a politically unstable
frames. Who doesn’t
recognize the silhouette
of Jack standing in front
of the giant moon, while
he was singing his melan-
cholic tune? This brings
me to Danny Elfman,
whose songs and score
augments the magic in
every way.

state, Theo (Clive Owen)
is coerced into helping a
group of freedom fighter
terrorists to protect Kee
(Clare-Hope Ashitey)
who appears to be the
first pregnant woman in
eighteen years.
Every moment of this
film is simply beautiful.
The cinematography is
helmed by Emmanuel
Lubezki, a frequent
collaborator of Cuaron.
Lubezki uses the frame
as a passive character
in the drama, with long
takes that drift off into the
bigger picture. The richly
dystopian world created
in this film is a perfect
canvas to paint the story
with Lubezki’s cinematic
brush, often with visceral
‘one-shot’ take set pieces
that are the precursors
to Lubezki’s work in
Birdman.
But is it a Christmas
film? What makes this
a perfect alternative
festive treat is twofold.
It is lathered in the sour,
(very) British pessimism
that is missing from these
vacuous times; having
said that, it is profoundly
uplifting and poignant in
its final third. Children of
Men is a modern retelling
of the Nativity and deals
with updated themes
for the 21st Century
audience, hitting home
ideas about terrorism,
refugee crises, and war.
It’s not a “feel-good-film-
of-the-year” per say, but it
will overwhelm you with
a humanitarian passion.
This film is an essential
festive antidote.
Children of Men is
avaliable on Netflix and
Amazon Prime, so there’s
no excuse to not watch
this masterpiece - SSM
whatever you watch for
Christmas every year. It
is time to witness the utter
delight that is The Night-
mare Before Christmas.
Nightmare before

iable on Disney’s new

Christmas with the

Deck the Halls

Jingle All the Way
This should Jingle All
The Way into the trash
A
movie so
excruciatingly
bad that never
stops shoving
the idea of a Merry Happy
Consumerist Christmas
down your throat, backed
up by an incredible cast
that never manages to hit
anywhere close to their
comedic timing. This
movie is a nightmarish
representation of the hell
space that is capitalist
With a combined score of 27% on Rotten Tomatoes, these three movies will give you a great excuse to torture that
annoying cousin who’s visiting, or provide a great drinking game by encouraging you to drink to forget.
Christmas, but for some
reason, maybe the so bad
it’s good effect, never
fails to entertain with it’s
cringy humour, half assed
execution that’s laughable
and sometimes honestly
just absolutely bizarro
plot. Do yourself and your
closest most loved family
a favour, and discover the
meaning of Christmas
with Tim Allen this year.
Not avaliable on any
of the popular premium
streaming sites, but good
god if you’re gonna watch
this, do NOT give them
your money! - MD

s p e n d i n g
months learning how to
speed skate, production
plagued with problems,
mainly huge disagree-
ments between the cast
over sex scenes, and
Danny DeVito, should
lead to a masterpiece.
But it isn’t, even with the
sheer volume of effort it
took to actually get made.
The jokes land flat, the
plot is confusing and on
my list it comes second
highest rated at 6% on
rotten tomatoes, but don’t
let that deter you. Every
moment of Danny DeVito
and Matthew Broderick
using their witty banter
and natural onscreen pres-
ence to find the spirit of
Christmas will leave you
laughing, most of the time
when it’s not meant to be
funny.
Deck the Halls is
available on Netflix, and
also any HMV bargain
bin. - MD
T
his movie
screams alarm
bells from the
very get go with
a cast of some of the
most notorious actors
of the time, Arnold
Schwarzenegger provid-
ing nothing more than
just showing up for his
Christmas paycheque
alongside none other than
the ‘Immortal Sinbad’.
The movie truly comes
into its element when you
realise that all of Sinbad’s
lines are improvised, and
better yet Arnie decides to
jump in on the action and
add his own artistic flair
to it. The result is a witty
repertoire of organic, real
dialogue that could rival
the likes of ‘Pulp Fiction’,
‘The Social Network’ and
‘The Godfather’. Must
Watch/10.
(There’s even a sequel
with Larry the Cable
Guy).
