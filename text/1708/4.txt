It's a Sabb, Sabb Situation
NEWS
With their first term in
office nearing its end,
Felix sat down with
the Union sabbatical
officers to discuss their
progress so far
Andy Djaba
Editor-in-Chief
Felix: For the people
that don't know, can
each of you explain
what your role is
James: I’m DPCS.
My role is two-fold in
looking after our 370-odd
clubs and societies, their
creation, their day-to-day
running and, when things
go wrong, basically
helping them out of a
pickle and supporting
them through that. It’s
also to do with the rep-
resentation side, which we
all work on. When a club,
society or general student
has an issue that they
want to make better - be
it about spaces, be it about
the activities theyre doing,
be it about how College is
supporting them - taking
that to College, working
with them and trying to
make that change.
Becky: I’m DPW. I
work with College quite
a lot to look at some of
the student services and
look at how they can be
improved and how they
work for students and
look at different policies
and things that are in
place around welfare. I
also work with two teams
of students: the wellbeing
reps, which are really im-
portant because College
is actually talking about
wellbeing now rather than
being a bit afraid of it.
Students are talking about
wellbeing, which is really
exciting. Then I also work
with the Liberation and
Community officers, who
we’re trying to build a
bigger platform for.
Dan: Hi I’m Dan,
I’m the President of the
School of Medicine’s
Students’ Union. I look
after the Students’ Union
along with 19 other
volunteer officers. Our
main role is to ensure that
all of medical school life
runs smoothly in ICSM
and then also ensuring
that the unique interests
of medical students and
BSC Medical Biosciences
students are represented
and taken into account at
all levels of the College,
Union and the faculty.
Claudia: Hi I’m
Claudia, I’m DPFS. My
role comes in two parts:
the finance part is looking
at the general overall
Union finances, contrib-
uting to annual budgeting
as well as looking at our
investment strategies and
where our money goes. I
also look at club finances,
so helping advise on event
budgets, financial plan-
ning and helping them
out with any day-to-day
transactions. The other
half is the services side;
looking at commercial
services within the Union,
what else we provide in
terms of health and safety
in the Union and then also
working with College,
looking at the kind of
special projects they’ve
got going around 24
hour vending, looking at
catering, looking at how
sustainable the College is.
Rob: I’m Rob, I’m the
Union President. I proba-
bly touch on a little bit of
everything in the way that,
in the Union, I support all
my Deputy Presidents and
then also I take control of
things such as governance
and democracy. In terms
of what I tackle at College,
my main role is probably
ensuring that the student
voice is heard at all levels.
So all the meetings all the
way up to top of College
Council to individual one-
on-ones in areas that we
really want to prioritise
- working on things like
widening participation,
wellbeing, educational
reform and so on.
Alejandro: I’m Ale-
jandro, I’m this year’s
DPE. My role is similar
to the other OTs in that
it has two parts. The first
is to lead and manage the
Academic Representa-
tion Network. That’s a
network of over 500 vol-
unteers and that consists
of everything from the
election process, through
training and support,
right up to making sure
that they’re embedded
in decision making at
all levels; that includes
departments, faculties and
College-wide. The other
side of my role is repre-
senting all students at the
higher levels - influencing
College policy to improve
it and keep students at
the centre and essentially
helping College to shape
some of their projects.
How have you found it
so far?
Becky: It’s been really
good. It’s been surprising
that College actually
listens to us. Basically,
I didn’t expect College
to listen to us at all but
College can’t listen to
19,500 people at the same
time, they have to listen
to one voice. They can’t
reply to every single
student’s e-mail so it’s
actually really important
to talk to us and then what
we say is really important
because College does
make big decisions based
on what we say.
Claudia: I’d agree with
Becky, I think the most
surprising thing for me
has been working with
College, how much they
listen to you.
Do the rest of you
think similarly, you've
been surprised with
how much interaction
you've had with
College?
Alejandro: Not just the
level of interaction but
the level of partnership
that exists that I didn’t
think existed when I first
went into the role. So,
like Becky, I didn’t think
they’d listen as much as
they do and it’s hard to
quantify that but the way
that I would describe it
is, when any of us are
sitting around a table with
a bunch of College staff,
we’re an equal at that
table and our voice is just
as relevant and important.
Over the course of
the year, how much
change do you think
you can actually
effect?
Claudia: I think we
all had our manifestos
coming in but, although
they’re things we want to
achieve and, if we solely
focus on that, we could
achieve most of them,
coming into the role, I’ve
noticed certain issues and
bigger priorities so some
points on my manifesto
have been put on the side
to address bigger issues. I
think it’s important to do
things that are relevant to
our current students. My
priorities have changed
throughout the year, ad-
dressing other things.
Rob: There’s the
projects that are handed
over from a previous year,
which can be of varying
scale. It could be just a
little thing that needs a
tick-off. To be honest, the
main project that I have
to do at the moment is a
disciplinary review, which
was delightfully handed
over by Chippy. That now
takes up a lot of my time.
I do think that, actually,
we’d be surprised with
how much we can tick off
our manifestos. The first
month, you’re figuring out
what the hell are we doing

Union
and the second month, all
of a sudden, you get that
wave of all the easy wins
that you can have, with
the little changes happen-
ing one after the other.
After that, things slowed
down, but the second
month for me was a really
productive one. There are
things that seem like they
will be a big fight and,
for whatever reason, you
meet the right person in
College and it works or it
could be that there’s just
loops and loops and loops.
My biggest frustration so
far has been the excuse,
“we’re doing it because
we’ve always done it
this way” or “it’s a step
forward”, when actually
we’re like, “well if you’re
making a step forward,
let’s make the right step
forward”. So, in that way,
it’s been frustrating and
that’s been both in the
Union and in College.
Probably, just because
of my role, it’s mainly in
College. It’s one of my
largest frustrations of
being there.
Give me a description
of what a typical day
or week looks like.
Alejandro: I go to a lot
of meetings. We all go to
a lot of meetings but, Rob
and I in particular, go to a
lot of meetings. The idea
behind that is to get the
student voice and opinion
embedded into all levels
of decision making. I go
to certain meetings to try
and help departments to
develop action plans and
then also to keep them
accountable to those
action plans. The whole
idea behind that is just to
improve the local student
experience in every de-
partment. The academic
reps are heavily involved
in that as well, they’re
working with departmen-
tal staff to develop those
action plans, together with
all the work that’s happen-
ing with the curriculum
review to just improve
the overall situation. But
a typical week, I’ll be
working on some of that,
I’ll be doing some Union
projects, we might have
something like Union
Council or Board of Trus-
tees or a sub-committee
which requires some
additional preparation. In
one day I can train reps
and work with reps, so
that’s a very local level of
working, and then, later
on in the day I’ll have a
meeting with the OTs to
discuss a Union project.
So it’s all different levels
that I can work on and any
day could look like that or
it could be different.
Rob: Things rotate
round because of how
many College meetings all
rotate on a monthly basis.
Probably about a third to
half of my time is spent in
those meetings, which can
range from anything from
a half an hour quick chat
with someone to 3-6 hour
stints in certain commit-
tees on all sorts of topics.
The project work fits in
around that. Also, because
of Union Board and Union
Council, quite a lot of the
mandated things tend to
end up coming toward my
direction so I have to fit
that into my timetabling
as well. It’s tough because
it’s so variable.
Claudia: I would say
I probably have a more
average month than an
average week. I think
one of the most important
things to highlight is that
the OTs meet up once a
week for at least two hours
and we catch eachother up
on all the different pro-
jects. We get eachother’s
views on things and then
we also discuss any papers
coming up to any of the
meetings happening that
week so we have a kind of
collaborative view. We’ve
thought of the student per-
spectives from all differ-
ent thoughts and gathered
our group’s knowledge.
The rest of the week, it
varies between doing
e-mails and meeting with
a lot of clubs and societies
to talk over event budgets,
looking at POs, dealing
with financial issues. You
won’t always find me at
my desk because, like
the other sabbs, we have
meetings we’re going in
and out of.
Dan: None of my
days are regular 9-5. I’ll
either have early stuff so
I attempt to finish early.
A lot of it going between
campuses, meeting with
faculty students. Just
ensuring all of the vol-
unteer officers under me
aren’t overburdened. I can
facilitate them with any
projects they want to work
on. If there’s anything that
they need help with then
ensuring that I can help
with that. A lot of it is
quite student-facing but
it completely varies day
on day. Some days I have
absolutely nothing, I can
sit down, smash through
some emails, do general
admin, but then some days
are lots of meetings with
different stakeholders. It’s
nice to keep it quite varied
to be honest, doesn’t get
monotonous at all.
Becky: I probably get
two or three students
coming to me with their
individual welfare related
problems. They can be
really serious ones, really
little ones. Sometimes
people come to me when
their friend has an issue
and they want to know
what to do. Then I tend to
be in touch with the well-
being reps at some point.
Normally one of them or
some of them have some
sort of questions or some-
thing they want to know
and so, between me and
someone in the Education
& Welfare team, that ques-
tion is normally answered.
There will normally be
something the Liberation
& Community officers
want to do so there will
be something around that.
Maybe it’s an event that
I’ll help them do or an
event that I go to to go and
see what’s going on. Then
there’s Union projects that
are happening.
James: My days are
split a bit reactively and a
bit proactively. It’s quite
nice, I get the consistency
of working on projects
much similar to a uni
project - plan it, execute
it, evaluate it at the end.
But also the chaos of stu-
dents getting up to things,
which is great fun. It’s
also quite worth saying, a
normal week for all of us
as a team is quite an odd
concept.
How have you found
working together as a
team?
Becky: We’re all
quite different, we all
have our strengths and
our weaknesses but they
seem to work quite well
together. We all have very
good knowledge bases of
different areas that also
gel quite well together.
We haven’t had any major
fallouts yet, which is
pretty impressive.
Claudia: We’re quite
willing to challenge
eachother. I’ve noticed
Becky challenges a lot
on accessibility so I’ve
actually become better at
challenging now College
when they mention some-
thing. Trying to think of
all the OT’s perspectives,
“have you thought about
this in terms of policy?
Have you thought of this
in terms of accessibility?
Have you thought about
how it’s going to affect all
the clubs and societies that
use this?” Its quite nice. I
think we push eachother
quite well.
Do you have any
specific plans
for getting more
involvmenet and
engagement across
the student body with
the Union?
Becky: One of our
team goals is commu-
nication. It’s definitely
something that’s on our
radar and something that
we’re trying to work on
to improve. We’re trying
different methods of com-
munication to see what
the students are interested
in. We’re trying to engage
people that we’ve previ-
ously not been as good
at engaging - post-grads,
people on different cam-
puses.
Claudia: I think com-
munication is two things.
We have team and Union
goals of how to do it but
also it can be quite per-
sonal for communicating
what we do as an OT or
a sabb. We’re each trying
our own different styles
in some ways because I
would say the best way
to connect with someone
is actually feeling like
they’re not a robot just
telling you stuff. You
actually feel a bit more
of a personal connection,
so your methods of com-
munication change there.
I’ve tried it with writing
Felix articles and blog-
ging. We’re open to ideas.
Alejandro: We have a
feeling of what we could
do better and we’re all
working on that individ-
ually. I think the postgrad
one is an example of
where it’s a systematic
problem that we have to
not just tackle in throw-
ing more messages at
them but actually asking
yourselves “why don’t we
get postgrads engaged?”
They’re not very well rep-
resented at council, that’s
a contributing factor.
Sum up the first term
of being a sabb. What
have your prioritised
this term?
Dan: It’s been a really
steep learning curve but a
really fulfilling experience
being able to work with a
bunch of really passionate
individuals from a lot of
different backgrounds
trying to achieve mostly a
common cause. Trying to
empower my volunteers
to get done what they
want. I can’t say I’ve
done it correctly all of
the time but I’ve tried my
best. Also trying to ensure
that the new curriculum
that’s coming in next year
and one of the national
exams that’s coming in is
consulted with students as
much as possible.
James: Let’s start with
a cliché. It’s been a whirl-
wind. It’s not at all been
like what it was advertised
as.
Alejandro: I didn’t
expect to be so challenged
and to learn as much as
I have learned. This role
is like a supercharged
graduate scheme in that
you are thrown into the
mix and you have to pick
things up and you have a
lot of responsibility from
day one, which is great.
Rob: Cliché-wise It's
definitely like trying to go
on to a moving treadmill
in that, if you don't hit
the ground absolutely
running, you're going to
fall flat on your face. In
terms of what I've prior-
itised, graduate student
engagement, that's a big
bit of work that we're
going through. Progress is
being made.
Claudia: A big priority
I want to tackle this year is
looking at our food supply
on campus. Looking
at the variety we offer,
especially in College after
certain hours, there isn't
much available for people
studying late at night so
we're looking into 24 hour
vending.
Who has the most
banter in the group
chat?
Becky:NOTCLAUDIA
