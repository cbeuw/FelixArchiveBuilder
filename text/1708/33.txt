Imperial College Water Polo Make History For Both
Whilst the ICSWP Men’s Water Polo Captain recounts
(in surprising detail) his boys’ impressive performance
against Bristol, the Women’s Water Polo Captain has
plenty to say about how her girls have progressed this
term with a review of a number of their matches over
the past few weeks.

Men’s Water Polo Captain
“For the first
time in history,
the Imperial
Men’s team
beat Bristol”
A
couple of weeks
ago, the water
polo boys
hopped on the
‘banter’ bus and headed to
Bristol’s pool.
It not only has a reputa-
tion for being very yellow,
but also for being the field
of battle for a water polo
team that has always
ranked in the top 5 in the
UK.
In fact, Imperial’s
Men’s team had never
won against Bristol.
Our luck was no differ-
ent that day and, after a
very close match, we lost
10-9
We knew we could beat
them.
And this weekend was
our best chance.
On Saturday, we
received them in our
temple, Queen Elizabeth’s
School Swimming Pool in
High Barnet, nicknamed
the home of Water Polo.
Bristol used all their
intimidation techniques:
got to the pool half an
hour early, did their
synchronized-high-knees
warm-up and slapped each
other very hard before
diving into the pool.
Those tricks wouldn’t
work on us.
We knew that despite
their perfectly matching
trunks, their nice water
bottles and their glucose
sachets; we were better
than them and were ready
to show it.
The match starts.
Will Moore receives
the ball and with his
magical left hand scores
an amazing goal straight
over the goalkeeper’s
head.
Even though this
happened within the first
two minutes, he had to sub
himself out, completely
out of breath after a wild
night with the former
ICSMWP president.
Our latest signing, Joe
Ortiz, scored another one
and the narrator one more
after a great pass from our
keeper, Joe Ireland.
3-0 up and things were
not looking good for
Bristol.
Somehow we got
distracted and, all of a
sudden, we were losing
6-7.
It wasn’t the time to
give up.
Suzy to Sasha, Sasha
to Suzy, tiki-taka, joga
bonito.
Suzy panicked for a
second there thinking
that he wasn’t wearing a
hat and that his baldness
would be finally revealed,
but then he remembered
that in water polo we wear
hats, all calm.
Ball to Sam Hanrahan
on the counter attack
(duh, of course he’s on the
counterattack, he swims
50m in 24s).
Sam looks to the middle
and witnesses something
incredible.
Our other centre-for-
ward, Laszlo Gero, a
Hungarian superstar who
weighs more than the
whole team combined,
was on the counter too!
Ball goes to Laszlo
who lobs the keeper with
perfect technique scoring
the equaliser.
Later that day, Laszlo
confessed that at the
time he didn’t realise that
he was swimming very
quickly, he thought that
he was in Metric chasing
a girl.
With the match finely
poised, we resorted to our
special tactics.
In defence, our cen-
tre-backs Leo Pashov
and TJ wouldn’t let their
pit player score and
MASSIVE TOBIAS
would drown any
opponent that dared to
look at the goal.
In attack, it was all
about man-ups.
Someone shouted
“Frosties!” and, like a
perfectly oiled machine,
we all knew what to do
and another goal came.
One goal up and
another man up.
Someone shouted
“Jacks!” and again,
another goal.
Two up, one minute to
go.
However, Bristol
wouldn’t make things
easy for us, with some
extra energy from their
glucose pouches, they
scored a cheeky backshot
and they were back to
within 1 goal, 9-8.
17 seconds to the end
of the match, tensions
building.
We had the ball.
Bristol desperately
tried to force a penalty,
hoping to get possession
after a potential miss.
However, it appears
they had failed to read
an up-to-date rule book
before the game; the rules
had been changed a few
years ago and we could
choose to simply keep
playing. Unlucky.
We kept the ball till the
end and, for the first time
in history, the Imperial
men’s team beat Bristol!
There were lots of tears,
but of course, everyone
used the high percentage
of chlorine as an excuse…
Big shoutout to our
coach, Adam Walzer, who
made this possible after
years of hard work.

Men’s and Women’s Teams
“A WIN FOR IC!
Oh no wait
they lost 10-5,
but it felt like
they had won”
A
fter a sickening
30-3 defeat in
the away game
that left them
shaking (literally), the
IC girls skipped merrily
along to High Barnet with
little expectation from
Saturday’s game other
than to have a nice time
and not get as destroyed
as last time they played
the Bristol women.
After a quick warm-up
consisting of just walking
into the humid conditions
of QE, Barnet, the top
team in the league took
the first goal of the match
(not us).
But plot twist. Orsina
Dessi wasn’t having
any of that and stole the
second goal of the game
for IC.
Seconds later she
managed to get two
majors at once and was in
danger of being benched
for the rest of the game.
The IC girls didn’t
know what it meant, but
it was provocative - it got
the people GOING.
Unfortunately it also
got the Bristol girls going
and IC were down 5-2 at
half time.
Seasoned veteran
Orsina decided that the
rest of the team needed
some encouragement to
had won.
They were hyped and
ready to face Bath the
next day.
The last time Bath saw
the IC girls, they were
young and innocent, in
their third week of term
and for some of them,
only in their first or second
week of polo.
They came all the way
from their little pool in
Ethos to find themselves
literally out of their depth
in Bath’s enormous pool
and had their first glimpse
of the opposition.
Their warrior-esque
face paint surely would
have intimidated the
newbie IC girls if they
weren’t already bricking
it at the fact that they
wouldn’t be able to stand
and have a rest in the
shallow end.
IC gave it their best
shot and came away with
a 20-8 loss.
This Sunday it was IC’s
turn to host.
Little did Bath know,
the IC girls had grown
strong.
The bruises from
training were worth
it - the innocent newbies
had blossomed into expe-
rienced polo-ers, and they
were ready and excited to
destroy Bath.
The opposition was
left ShOoK after IC set
up a perfect opportunity
for centre-forward Liina
Jukko and scored after
only 26 seconds!
The girls decided that
even that wasn’t good
enough, and in a record
time of 23 seconds later,
IC took the second goal.
Seeing the blue
smudges running down
the faces of the opposition
as well as the 4-0 score
after the first quarter was
enough to satisfy IC that
this one was theirs.
But Bath wasn’t giving
up.
The excitement of the
first quarter led to a few
tactical errors from the IC
team, including forgetting
that they were whites
and passing to the wrong
team.
Bath managed to sneak
in 4 goals.
Luckily our girls
weren’t far behind. With a
beautiful shot from leftie
Maria Medeiros and two
incredible counters from
Maria Pitteri, they were
still up 9-4 at half time.
The third quarter
was owned by Georgie
Powell with a repeat of
her flawless performance
from the previous day,
scoring on another two
drives.
This may be becoming
a new IC tradition!
The final quarter.
Withmostoftheplayers
unable to see the ball due
to the questionable levels
of chlorine, pretty much
nothing at all happened.
Little did everyone
know, the IC goalie
Nastya Kolesnikova
has super strength and
chlorine resistant eyeballs
and was able to put in the
performance of a century,
saving not just 1, not 2,
but 3 one-on-one shots IN
A ROW.
Absolutely outrageous.
After the longest
quarter in history with no
substitutions, time-outs or
goals - even after some
very desperate counters
from the captain - it was
finally over.
IC had won 12-5.
With another win
last weekend against
Birmingham and a draw
against Cambridge, the IC
girls are looking seriously
strong this year and are
now enjoying a well-de-
served break before their
final two games next term.
Watch this space.

shoot, so casually dropped
in another one, while the
rest of the team had a
lovely time annoying the
opposition by stopping all
of their goals.
So far, so good.
Bristol were only
winning 6-2.
But IC wanted some
goals, and it all went down
in the last quarter.
Swimmer turned
polo-er Georgina Powell
realised that if she kept
swimming towards the
goal, she would get closer
to the goal, and with two
incredible assists from
newbie Daisy Ellis this led
to two more goals for IC.
10-4 to Bristol.
But wait, there’s 5
seconds left on the clock,
they have the ball, and
there’s been no goal from
la Capitana… she was
absolutely not having that.
A cheeky steal from
Bristol and a quick sprint
for the goal with 3 seconds
to go… she shoots…
she SCOOORES with 2
seconds on the clock.
A WIN FOR IC!
Oh no wait they lost
10-5, but it felt like they
