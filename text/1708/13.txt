The cost of wasting meat
C
onsuming meat
is bad for the
environment.
Meat production
produces huge amounts
of greenhouse gases,
consumes millions of
liters of water and takes
up monstrous quantities
of land. Yep, we’ve heard
it over and over again.
However, have you ever
considered the impact of
actually throwing away
the meat that is not eaten?
Food waste represents
a huge problem, with
7.3 million tons of food
wasted by UK households
every year. In fact, a third
of food purchased in the
UK is thrown away. Of
that amount, households
are wasting around
570,000 tons of fresh meat
each year which is equiv-
alent to about 50 million
chickens, 1.5 million pigs
or 100,000 beef cattle.
Globally it’s close to 12
billion animals, a huge
amount of living creatures
born to be killed and
wasted.
Producing, processing
food in the UK are no
longer grazed on grass
or, in the case of pigs and
poultry, fed food waste.
Instead, over recent
decades a highly industrial
system has emerged, with
animals being housed in
large numbers and fed on
feed shipped in from all
over the globe. This feed
takes huge amounts of
land to grow, it consists of
a third of all crops grown
globally, and in coun-
tries such as Brazil and
Paraguay, forests are cut
down and rural communi-
ties thrown off the land to
make way for them.
One quarter of global
freshwater use relates to
producing meat and dairy,
which is likely to increase
if production continues to
rise. Livestock is respon-
sible for nearly 15% of
all global greenhouse gas
emissions contributing
to global climate change.
Beef, in particular,
produces 25kg of CO2 per
kg of meat.
From this, it is clear
that wasting food and
especially meat uses up
valuable resources and is
terribly damaging for the
environment.
So, what can we do to
help? Some argue that
veganism is the only way
forward. A study last year
showed that if all Ameri-
cans substituted beans for
beef, the country would
achieve over half of the
reduction in greenhouse
gas emission agreed by
the United States in 2008.
This would also free up
42% of the country’s crop
land. Nevertheless, not
eating any meat is not the
only answer. If you don’t
want to completely give it
up, a simple contribution
would be to waste less of
the meat you buy. That
in itself will help prevent
resources being used for
nothing.
There are simple steps
you can take to make a
difference:
• Find out about different
date labels. Did you know
you can freeze food right
up to 24 hours before the
use by date?
• Eat less but better
quality meat, and avoid
beef, so that there’s less
meat to waste and what
you do use will be kinder
to the planet.
• Plan meals, get your
portions right and make
the most of the food you
buy.
• Store your food
correctly to keep it fresh
for longer.
• Make last night’s
leftovers today’s feast.
• Try making one day
a week vegan or vege-
tarian, and try limiting
the amount of red meat
you consume to just one
portion a week, the planet
will thank you!
O
ver 1,000 pro-
testers from
the environ-
mental cam-
paign group Extinction
Rebellion came together
in Central London on
the Saturday 28th No-
vember to demand en-
vironmental justice and
demand legislative ac-
tion to confront climate
breakdown and the glob-
al biodiversity crisis.
The Extinction Rebel-
lion campaign has mobi-
lised thousands of activists
across the UK to partici-
pate in acts of mass civil
disobedience, causing
major disruptions across
London. This Saturday’s
protests blocked Parlia-
ment Square, marched on
Buckingham Palace and
finally went on to block
Westminster Bridge. They
marched clad in black
as a funeral procession,
with memorials that were
stacked at the Palace gates
for all that has been lost
and all that might be lost
if governmental inaction
continues. Saturday’s
demonstration follows 2
weeks of action organised
by Extinction Rebellion.
The previous weekend,
6,000 people gathered on
London’s 5 major bridges,
blocking all roads across
the Thames river and
creating gridlock in the
city centre in one of the
biggest acts of peaceful
civil disobedience in the
UK in decades.
Some have criticised
the movement for the
disruptions caused, but
the organisers argue that
“the ‘social contract’ has
been broken...it is there-
fore not only our right but
our moral duty to bypass
the government’s inaction
and flagrant dereliction of
duty and to rebel to defend
life itself.”
In their declaration
of rebellion, read aloud
by all who participated
this weekend at the gates
of Buckingham Palace,
Extinction Rebellion
“call[ed] upon every prin-
cipled and peaceful citizen
to rise with [them].” The
declaration ends with
the following, “we act
in peace, with ferocious
love of these lands in our
hearts. We act on behalf of
life.”
