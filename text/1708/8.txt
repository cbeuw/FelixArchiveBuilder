Is mass immigration compatible with the idea
The question of mass immigration is neither new or one we have dared to think more

Perhaps to begin an-
swering this question we
should start by defining
what really is national-
ism. As with many other
abstract concepts, what
tends to happen is that dif-
ferent communities chose
to define the concept in a
waythatsuitstheiragenda,
but in the simplest way of
putting it, nationalism “…
is primarily a political
position, which holds that
the national unit and the
political unit should be
congruent” according to
Ernest Gellner.
So, what does this
statement actually mean?
In physical terms it means
that the community that is
being considered would
be the same community
that is in power. Arguably,
this seems like a very
legitimate concept that
coincides with the right
of self-determination. You
have the inherent right as
a community to decide
who governs you, and as
a general rule, we tend
to choose governments
made out of people that
think like us, that we
identify with and that we
believe represent us as
much as possible. But this
can break down in two sit-
uations: firstly, when the
community demographic
shifts in a very sudden
and inorganic manner and
thus the government is
no longer representative
of said community, or
alternatively, when the
community is too diverse
for it to be accurately and
fairly represented by one
party in power.
Both of these instances
can arise as a consequence
of mass immigration,
because ultimately, this
significantly shifts the
demographic of the na-
tionhood that is being rep-
resented in an unnaturally
fast way, and thus means
that there is a disconnect
between the ‘national unit’
and the ‘political unit’.
However, this does
not mean that a func-
tional government is not
viable when the nation
is diverse in background
and ethnicities, and there
are many case studies of
thriving countries that
have established their
government as federal
or community based, or
similar structures that are
sub-divided to represent
each ‘sub-national unit’.
An interesting example
to look at is Lebanon,
dividing its parliament
seat allocation according
to religious groups, to
ensure all of them are
represented to one extent
or another. Paradoxically,
this example can also
be used to illustrate the
exact opposite argument:
because communities
should govern them-
selves. Lebanon has had
to engineer its way around
the fact that its communi-
ty is so diverse, in order to
fully and optimally repre-
sent all of the groups and
preserve said congruence
that nationalism requires.
But then again, this begs
the question: what really
is a community? Is it a
religion, as the Lebanese
government model could
lead us to think? Is it a col-
lective of same language
speakers? Is it even race?
History has proven that it
is both none of them and
all of them at the same
time.
Maybe that is the true
question that we should be
asking, and if had known
the answer we would have
saved humanity a lot of
bloodshed. Africa would
have not been so poorly
divided by its colonisers
using a geographical
criterion as opposed to
a nation/tribe-based
criterion, thus avoiding a
very large proportion of
tribal wars and conflicts.
Perhaps we would also
understand that nations
turn they often resort to
cultural appropriation of
the Palestinian culture).
But for the sake of the
question we have posed
today, let us accept that
a nation is a community
united through charac-
teristics they share such
as, but not necessarily;
religion, culture, common
history, language amongst
others.
Having taken a slight
detour to establish what
we think is a nation,
and what nationalism is,
we return to the initial
question: can mass im-
migration be compatible
with nationalism? The
answer, I believe, depends
on a very important
factor: whether or not the
immigrating community
is the same one that then
acquires power or not.
Let us assume that the
migrating community
does not then go on to be
represented by the organ
in power. In that case
they are not compatible,
since the core definition
of nationalism relies on
the fact that both the
governed and the gover-
nors are the same. If the
amount of immigration
is of a smaller scale, the
shift in demographic traits
is less perceivable and
thus a significant change
in the government body
is not of utmost necessity.
The extent to which the
principle of nationalism
is violated is not notable
enough for us to say that
the link between both
entities has been broken.
However, because we are
specifically outlining that
the order of magnitude of
the immigration wave is
much higher, this means
that there is an upset in the
equilibrium of the system.
Migrant family running away from tear gas at Mexican American border/ / Reuters
cannot be manufactured
artificially, and it would
make it very obvious to
the international com-
munity what the aim of
Israel is. They too seem
to ask themselves what a
nation is, and are trying
to tick some sort of
checklist of ingredients
you need in order to form
one: religion (Judaism),
history (their alleged his-
torical claim to the holy
land), language (reviving
Hebrew, that had ceased
to be an everyday spoken
language somewhere
between 200 and 400 CE)
and culture (this one much
harder for them given as
the Israeli community is
made up of many different
nationalities and radically
different cultures, so in
compatible with nationalistic governments and their ideas?

If we were to consider
national unit as a balance
of two sides, and the
nation as one weight
on the balance, and the
government as the other,
nationalism merely says
that both must be in equi-
librium, the weight being
a metaphor as to how truly
the government represents
the nation. Adding mass
immigration into the
equation means that the
balance tilts towards the
nation very suddenly, and
unless you adjust the gov-
ernment, the equilibrium
breaks and the proposal
of nationalism no longer
holds true.
Alternatively, there
are two scenarios where
mass immigration is still
compatible with nation-
alism. The first one, as
previously mentioned,
is when the government
is re-adjusted to suit the
needs of the new demo-
graphic. Most examples
of this situation generally
involve a colonial com-
munity forcibly removing
the native community
through mass immigration
and imperialistic use of
power, and it is through
these same tactics that the
new government is put in
place to maintain the na-
tionalistic principle. Some
examples include the
United States of America,
with their mass immigra-
tion and ultimately almost
eliminating the Native
Americans originally
living in the land, and
similarly, the same can be
said about Australia.
Another possibility
which is in fact subtler
Forced mass Palestinian migration during al Nakba(Arabic name for their ethnic cleansing)// Wikipedia
but just as interesting can
be very clearly illustrated
in the example of Jordan.
Jordan is a country of
about 9 million people
(CIA, 2018), where 2
million are Palestinian
refugees (UNRWA,
2018) and an even higher
proportion of which are
of Palestinian descent.
In this particular case the
government was never
changed from a monarchy,
and there were no major
internal conflicts within
the Jordanian society
itself. The influx of Pales-
tinians was not organic, as
it was triggered by mass
ethnic cleansing, so this is
indeed a suitable example
to consider as mass immi-
gration. It is worth noting
that there was a full-scale
war between Jordan and
Palestine from 1970 to
1971, known as the Black
September (ThoughCo,
2015), but this is not
related to the coexistence
between Palestinians and
Jordanians within Jordan.
This is another example
where a community of a
significant enough size
existed within a host com-
munity without disrupting
the existing government,
and the nationalistic
proposal did not in fact
hold true.
On the other hand, an
argument that mass immi-
gration is not compatible
with nationalism is the
fact that when the colonial
community is unsuccess-
ful in fully establishing
itself, the native com-
munity usually restores
nationalistic balance
through a revolution that
enables them to be repre-
sented by a government
of their own community.
Some case studies include
Algeria and India, both
respectively succeeding
in removing the colonial
body from power since
the nation’s demographic
did not in fact, match the
demographic in power.
This furthers the notion
that mass immigration is
incompatible with nation-
alism, because the reason
why the revolution occurs
is to restore the connec-
tion between the people
and their leaders.
Ultimately, I believe
it is safe to conclude that
the very basic principle of
nationalism, that nations
should govern them-
selves, holds true in most
of the situations of recent
modern history, and that
mass immigration, unless
followed by a re definition
of the governing body,
will upset the established
equilibrium, and thus is
not compatible with na-
tionalism’s core principle.
