Nick Makoha: poetry on the boards
A
t the begin-
ning of The
Dark, Michael
Balogun, one
of the show’s two actors,
introduces himself. “Hi,.
I’m Nick”. We are then
asked to close our eyes
and remember that “You
are me”. In this disarming
way begins a play that
subtly whisks the audi-
ence into the complicated
and human world of Idi
Amin’s Uganda, only to
then run them screaming
out of it again. Telling the
story of poet and play-
wright Nick Makoha’s
escape from Uganda, this
is the kind of show that
you dream about going to
see as a student.
The entire story is told
by a single actor and
actress. They spin and
whirl around each other,
moving from character
to character – each one
defined less by the minor
clothing changes but by
the huge changes the
actors themselves make,
altering voice and body
like contortionists to
welcome us into the world
they have created.
“At every moment
on stage, there are these
two characters. They are
always on stage. For an
hour and 10 minutes these
two actors have to be on
all the time. It is very
intense for the actors and
the audience,” explains
Nick when I ask him
about it.
Meeting Nick Makoha
is like stepping onto a
cruise liner. He hums with
a vast sub-audible energy
and a mind made of bright
and spinning wheels.
“There is always the
duality of the two charac-
ters, the pairs that bounce
off each other.”. This is
more than just guff. The
play manages to make
scenes alternatively very
full and very lonely. We
move from a crowded
bus station onto the bus
(or matatu) heading to the
Kenyan border – using
only some benches and a
hanging structure repre-
senting the baggage rack
of the bus, piled high with
peoples’ lives – to the
lonely road plagued with
checkpoints and soldiers
who are a mix of high,
bored and greedy.
I ask him how he
manages to bring people
with him into the African
world of his childhood.
“When you are
watching Star Wars, you
totally believe you are
on Tatooine or the Death
Star.” He sighs; this is
a question, I think, that
he has answered before.
“People will think this
isn’t my world, but they
[the actors] bring across
the humanity and allow
you to suspend your
disbelief – to make this
your story, make this a
story that you are willing
to watch without ques-
tioning, with the same
inquisitiveness of a child”
He goes on to talk
about how “in many parts
of the world people have
with the people there.
“I could say America is
nice or I could show you
some Americans. I could
say that Uganda is a very
strange place or instead
let me tell you about this
mother and her son.”
He laughs. “Though
I am a metic. My metic
experience is unique and
I cannot speak for all of
the continent” Metic.
The word crops up again
and again. Literally ‘a
foreigner living in an
ancient Greek city who
had some of the privileges
of citizenship’, the word
has come to represent
those immigrants stuck
in a penumbra between
their country of birth and
their adopted country,
“an increasingly common
situation nowadays”.
What Nick stresses
over and over is that the
play was never intended
to be about Uganda. It was
meant to be about people,
Ugandans, who had to flee
their country of birth and
set up a new home else-
where. The play’s greatest
success is how, even after
the words that begin the
play [“You are me”] are
an hour and ten in the
past, Nick has been so
successful in his spinning
of the world around the
audience that when we
– Nick and us – are con-
fronted by the immigra-
tion officer at Heathrow
asking why we don’t
have the correct papers,
it feels like an unjustified
attack. We are made the
immigrant and it is hard
and shocking. Having
grown accustomed to
voices speaking in a thick
and easy Ugandan accent,
the sound of clipped and
too-perfect vowels chal-
lenging us, questioning
us, and doubting us hits
like a train. Nick Makoha
has crafted a masterpiece
that emerges from the
true and silent dark of
unlit Ugandan roads, not
to challenge us but to
welcome us and ask us in
its insistent and convinc-
ing tones to go forth and
challenge with it.

an image of that part of

Uganda. Just to tell you a

For Nick, a lot of

our lack of familiarity

La Bohème | One of opera’s great classics
T
he romanticised
notion of the
struggling artist
– impoverished
but ingenious, penniless
but praiseworthy – was
a big hit with the public
when La Bohème first
premiered in 1896. As
a uni student living on
a budget, the plight
of Rodolfo (Jonathan
Tetelman), Marcello
(Nicholas Lester),
Colline (David Soar)
and Schaunard (Božidar
Smiljanić) feels only too
relatable. Well-educated
but without proper jobs,
they talk of Demosthenes
and the pleasures of high
society while freezing in
a drafty garret. And who
hasn’t suffered from self-
doubt about their work
like Roldofo, who burns
his five-act manuscript for
kindling?
The witty repartee and
exchanges of the four
friends are one of the best
things about La Bohème,
with the original Italian
libretto the result of four
years’intensive collabora-
tion between Puccini and
his two librettists Giacosa
and Illica. Amanda
Holden’s English trans-
lation, thankfully, does
it great justice: hilarious
banter flies back and forth
between Lester, Tetelman,
Soar and Smiljanić, who
portray the four friends
with effervescent camara-
derie.
These moments of
levity in La Bohème only
make the tragedies of
the play more acute. As
Colline and Schaunard
battle it out with ba-
guettes, Musetta rushes in
to tell them that Mimi is
dying. It’s a rollercoaster
trip that enthralls from
start to finish. But for it
to work, the audience has
to be invested in the love
story between Roldofo
and Mimi that lies at the
heart of La Bohème. Here,
great onstage chemistry
between Tetelman and
Romaniw makes their
story genuinely moving.
The scene when Mimi
and Rodolfo brush hands
in the dark has got to be
one of the most beautiful
pieces in opera. Tetel-
man’s soaring, romantic
tenor is a delight to the
ear in the famous aria
‘What a cold little hand’,
though possibly a little
overwrought even for a
poet in love. Romaniw’s
response, ‘Yes, they call
me Mimi’ is entirely
in-character, appropri-
ately measured and shy,
while showing her voice’s
full clarity and range – not
an easy thing to do. What
an ENO debut to make!
In fact, the acting from
the whole cast was on
point. Nadine Benjamin,
fresh from ENO’s recent,
very well-received Porgy
and Bess, is especially
enjoyable to watch as the
vivacious Musetta, rev-
elling flirtatiously in her
sensuality.
This year marks the
fourth revival of Jonathan
Miller’s classic produc-
tion; watching it, it is
easy to see why. Miller
has really captured the
essence of the La Bohème
that Puccini envisioned.
Set in 1920s Paris, the set
is wonderfully designed;
the sunlit second-floor
garret morphs quite
magically into a crowded
Parisian street outside the
Café Momus, and then
into a desolate alley on
a snowy winter evening.
Playful details and vi-
gnettes abound without
distracting from the main
action, adding a touch of
reality to the events on
stage. With this produc-
tion, all that is needed for
perfection is a good set
of singers. Fortunately,
the cast all deliver solid
performances, Romaniw
especially standing out as
Mimi.
With the orchestra
playing the swelling notes
of Puccini under the mas-
terful direction of Alex-
ander Joel (a La Bohème
veteran, having conducted
it over a hundred times), it
is a fine evening of opera
indeed. A treat for the
ears and eyes – and an
emotional upheaval for
the heart!
Let us tell you all about this amazing show, with prose written by experienced writers, well-versed in their chosen
topic.

How Much? From £12
have been so deeply loved
by audiences for hundreds
of years is telling. Though
often with far-fetched
mystical plots, opera
allows us to experience
stories ordinarily unat-
tainable, unimaginable, in
our everyday lives. More
importantly, these stories
allow audiences to experi-
ence a passionate range of
emotions, with revealing
and relatable tales full of
life, death, joy, anger, and,
perhaps most relevantly,
love.
Perhaps I was naive
to be shocked by the sad
conclusion of La Bohème.
But even though I know
that Rudolfo and Mimi’s
love is ultimately doomed,
I’m sure I will be equally,
if not more, moved next
time, the futility and fra-
gility of their love making
their story all the more
poignant.

Watching La Bohème
for the first time. I was
devastated to watch the
love story crumble before
my eyes in the third act.
Why is it that opera’s
greatest love stories
always seem to end in
tragedy? Verdi’s Alfredo
and Violetta, Wagner’s
Tristan and Isolde, Pur-
cell’s Dido and Aeneas,
to name but a few – all
deeply and utterly in love,
all ultimately destined for
death or heartbreak (or
both – this is opera after
all).
