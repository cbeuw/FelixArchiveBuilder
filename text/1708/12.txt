ables heaving
with plates of
food, stacks
of presents
spilling out from under a
tree smothered in tinsel
and baubles, and rolls
of lights beaming into
outer space… This may
seem like the epitome of
the festive season, but
is Christmas really not
about more than what
we consume? Christmas
has become synonymous
with over-indulgence -
over-eating, drinking and
spending. We feel com-
pelled to make the best
of the offers that are con-
stantly thrown at us- even
if we don’t need, want or
even like the products that
we are buying. What’s
more, each year there is
pressure to improve upon
the previous one – by
buying and spending
more. But how much need
for this is there? Shouldn’t
we stop to consider how
much waste we are pro-
ducing – all the excess
food, packaging, and
gadgets we are churning
out for this festive season?
At such a wasteful time of
year even making small
changes can make a dif-
ference to our impact on
the environment.
When buying a new
smartphone do we
consider the hundreds of
thousand workers at fac-
tories who work overtime
to churn out gadgets and
trinkets at this time of
year? Do we consider
what happens to all the
packaging, or all the food
we throw away after a
Christmas day roast? Is
this kind of gift-giving
really all so good? Could
we instead invest our
time and talents to make
a better Christmas for all?
1. Plan ahead
The key to both a more
ecological and econom-
ical Christmas lies in the
planning. Good intentions
are often thrown to the
wind in the last-minute
panic to get everything
done. If you know exactly
what you want to buy
and where from, you can
pretty much finish your
Christmas shopping in
one go, simultaneously
avoiding those hideously
expensive delivery fees
(plus the stress of seeing
if they arrive in time) and
the excessive boxes and
“We feel a
compulsive
need to make
the best of
the offers that
are constantly
thrown at us
even if we
don’t actually
need, want or
even like the
products that
we buy”
packaging that come with
it.
Equally, if you force
yourself to decide what
you will cook and when
you will eat, you can
actually buy the right
quantity of food, clear
freezer and fridge space
so that you have room
for extras, and make use
of the huge abundance of
great leftover recipes like
those on BBC Good Food.
Not only are you reducing
your food wastage but
also preventing the costly
impulse buys.
2. Spend less,
give better
According to the Centre
for Retail Research,
around £79 billion was
spent in the UK between
mid November and the
end of December last
year, and particularly as
a student it’s very easy to
feel a mounting panic at
the amount of money dis-
appearing from your bank
account in the approach
to Christmas. However,
by spending and buying
less you can not only save
money but also reduce the
amount we are wasting.
When it comes to presents
less really is more. Our
society makes us feel it is
necessary to spend time
and money in shops in
order to express our grat-
itude for each other. but is
there really any point in
giving gifts for their own
sake and in receiving yet
another useless trinket?
Gifting ideas like Secret
Santa mean you can
afford to buy fewer, but
more meaningful, gifts.
Another great way to
reduce waste is by gifting
experiences rather than
items, especially here in
London where there’s so
much to do and often so
much money required to
do it. Tickets to a concert,
a football match or the
theatre are after all so
much more memorable
than a generic gift box.
3. Upgrade your
cards
Our habits in less-con-
sidered areas also need to
change when you consider
that, according to A Sus-
tainable Life, an online
guidetosustainableliving,
an astonishing one billion
Christmas cards end up
in the bin. If sending
cards is important to you
why not go paperless?
There are a huge number
of affordable options for
sending e-cards: compa-
nies like Greenvelope are
focused on sustainability;
Ojolie allow you to send
unlimited cards for a £12
yearly membership; Pa-
perless Post allows photo
customisation. Even
better, you can donate to
charity at the same time.
Large charities including
Barnados, Oxfam and
Macmillan offer good
e-card services as well.
It’s also worth considering
how you dispose of any
cards you receive. Recy-
cling these may make you
feel better, but especially
since China’s ban import
of waste for recycling (see
Sustainability section in
Felix 1706) they may still
end up going to landfill or
incineration. Instead, why
not reuse them as gift tags
or make into ornaments or
wreaths?
4. Be creative with
wrapping
Accepting that there
will be some physical
presents to give, how
to give them is a whole
dilemma in itself. In the
UK alone 227,000 miles
of wrapping paper is used
each Christmas - that’s
enough to go around the
Earth nine times!
Following the old
mantra of ‘Reduce,
Reuse, Recycle’ the best
option yet again is to wrap
fewer presents. Often
gifts come already in a
box or festive packaging,
so resist the temptation
to put wrapping paper on
top of that. Awkwardly
shaped gifts may actually
look better unwrapped
and consider how much
time can save just by
covering them with a
scarf or blanket. If you
do want to do some actual
wrapping you could invest
in some reusable fabric
such as the reindeer print
produced by Happy Wrap.
This actually looks really
festive and the higher
price is justified by the
fact it will last. This could
be a really good option
for giving gifts to close
family as you can reclaim
it afterwards! If you want
a more classical wrapping
methodyoucouldconsider
using newspaper or brown
paper – both very cheap
materials - and add festive
twine like the ones offered
from eco-craft to make it
look prettier and biode-
gradable tape to make it
recyclable. Alternatively,
if you’re not such a pro
at wrapping and can’t
produce an artistic mas-
terpiece you could opt for
some recycled wrapping
paper. Rewrapped has
some nice Christmas
designs to choose from or
if you’re happy to spend
more Oxfam has some
pretty handmade paper.
As long as you’re careful
you can reuse these
wrapping papers as well
– any crumples shouldn’t
be beyond the flattening
capabilities of an iron. As
a last resort checking that
it is recyclable – paper
with glitter on it or that
won’t hold its shape when
scrunched is definitely not
recyclable – is better than
nothing.
These ideas are just a
starting point to so much
more, but Christmas is
the one time where em-
bracing even a few small
changes can reduce so
much waste. Lets resist
the temptation to forget
about the environment
over the festive period,
and as we give presents to
our friends and family, try
to give this present to our
planet too.
Proof that wrapping with brown paper doesn’t mean
your presents will look plain years to come // Deavita
