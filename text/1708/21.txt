London and Life Lessons
A
nyone who has
grown up in
a small town
or commu-
nity surrounded by the
same people can relate
to the feeling of social
claustrophobia. During
adolescence, when
emotions are high and
everyone wants to fit in,
this becomes even more
pronounced. In “Cuckoo”,
written by Lisa Carroll
and set in Ireland, these
themes are explored on
a whirlwind journey of
popularity, insecurities
and general teenage angst.
Iona, played by Caitri-
ona Ennis, has spent her
whole life yearning to be
part of the popular crew.
Her mute non-binary
friend Pingu, played by
Elise Heaven, convinces
her to leave the small
town of Crumlin, Ireland
for a new life in London.
All of a sudden, the
popular crew – Toller
(Sade Malone), Pockets
(Colin Campbell) and
Trix (Peter Newngton) –
take an interest in them
and the drama of teenage
life ensues! The plot is not
the most original, but the
journey that each charac-
ter goes on is incredibly
emotive. Pingu is able to
convey so much with so
few words (none). Their
characters are unique and
well executed; the manner
with which the non-binary
element is introduced
and developed is perfect.
Other writers should take
notes! Iona and Toller
are quite unimaginative
characters who go on the
usual expected journeys:
the loser who realizes
what she had all along
and the popular girl who
realizes being nice doesn’t
hurt. That being said, the
actors all execute their
characters brilliantly.
With such a small cast
(only five people) and
approximately two hours
of high energy material
without an interval, the
endurance of these actors
must be admired.
The script constantly
throws in references
which hit a sweet spot
for millennials. Iona, for
example, lists her London
todolist:“thebigTopshop,
Ministry of Sound and
Wetherspoons”. Phones
are used throughout the
performance. Whether it
be actors texting, taking
pictures or watching
snapchat stories, these
moments always worked
with the plot and did not
feel forced. The themes
of popularity, adolescence
and bullying might be uni-
versal but by integrating
social media, this modern
take is all the more mean-
ingful.
The audience was
seated in a few rows facing
each other, with a space in
the middle, the stage. This
made for some slightly
uncomfortable moments
as you could find yourself
staring at someone in the
audience across. This did
however make for a truly
shared experience as you
could literally see others
going through the same
emotions, evoked from
the play, as you were. The
actors would storm onto
and off the stage in dif-
ferent directions, making
for a dynamic experience.
Music was very impor-
tant, especially for setting
the scene as a party, just
outside a party, or even
a chicken shop. Strobe
lighting was used to
recreate the slow-motion
clubbing scenes which are
so ubiquitous to coming-
of-age TV shows.
Overall, this play is
perfect for the binge
watching generation,
who won’t want to take
their eyes off of it. It is at
times funny, at times sad,
and at times moving but
it is definitely unique in
relation to the characters,
the stage setup and the
overall execution.
Jeannie: An Enchanting Revival
A
long-overdue
journey into the
repertoire of
an overlooked
female playwright, this
is (shockingly) the first
professional production
of Jeannie in nearly
80 years. Within two
hours we are taken on a
whirlwind journey with
protagonist Jeannie, who,
upon receiving a generous
inheritance following the
death of her cantankerous
father, ventures outside
her “wee one-eyed” town
and manages to attract
the attentions of both a
British washing machine
inventor named Stanley,
and a Viennese Count.
The very small,
intimate theatre allowed
the audience to become
totally wrapped up in the
story, and the set tran-
sitions help to signpost
where you are in the play
and transform the space
completely. The only
trouble with these tran-
sitions was that they did
lag on at times, ultimately
detracting from the im-
mersive experience of the
play. However, I do see
that this was unavoidable
with the drastic location
changes between various
countries, and admire the
fact that the actors both
played their roles and
carried out the staging
transitions simultaneously
as smoothly as possible.
The performances of
Mairi Hawthorn (Jeannie)
and Matthew Mellalieu
(Stanley) really stood out
for me, with their natural
chemistry and wonderful-
ly witty repartee; after a
slow first few scenes, the
play only really started
for me when the pair first
met. The entire cast nailed
every bit of dialogue in
all its emotion and charm
– even the questionable
French and Austrian
accents only added to
the humour of the play.
But the real magic of the
dialogue is all thanks
to the mastery of the
playwright herself, Aimée
Stuart (1886-1981). With
a life full of questioning
conventions and seeking
adventure, she’s incredi-
bly underrated as an artist
(what with her previously
banned play Love of
Women, which polemi-
cally depicted lesbianism,
it’s a real mystery that I’d
never come across her).
The play isn’t
ground-breaking in its
message or its themes,
nor is it written as such.
Rather it sends us home
with a very real message
– one that is universal and
unrestricted by the era in
which we encounter it, be
it the first show in 1940
or 2018 in Finborough
Theatre. This is the story
of a flawed and naïve
woman, who indeed
makes mistakes, yet at
the same time gives as
good as she gets with
a fiery personality and
determination to pave her
own path. I’m certain we
can all see a part of our-
selves in this character.
It’s a beautiful rendering
which states that yes, life
can be harsh and not at all
what you expect, but at
the same time it’s never
too late to start your own
adventure, and it’s always
worth the risk.
