Medical Devices under the Spotlight
T
echnology has
d r a m a t i c a l l y
changed every
aspect of life as
we know it, with medicine
being one of the most im-
portant aspects. Medicine
has been revolutionized
through medical imaging,
drugs, implants and more.
What happens, however,
when the medical device
industry fails? The
International Consortium
of Investigative
Journalists (ICIJ) con-
ducted a year-long global
study on this and pub-
lished their findings.
Tight regulations
surround the pharmaceu-
tical industry, requiring a
large amount of clinical
testing before being
approved. While there
are regulations put in
place for medical devices,
they aren’t as rigid as for
drugs. As a result, medical
devices are put on the
market faster and have a
higher chance of causing
harm, such as puncturing
organs, delivering errant
shocks, poisoning blood
and more, leading to
“explant operations” or
permanent harm. So, what
could have led to such
mistakes?
Firstly, it is hard to
find reports on defective
devices. Some regula-
tions, such as the ones in
practice in the US until
2017, allowed breast
implant companies to bury
evidence of harm by not
publicly disclosing their
reports.When this practice
stopped, the number of
injuries reported skyrock-
eted. Outside of the US,
it is even harder to obtain
information. For instance,
in Europe many reports
cannot be disclosed or are
never collected in the first
place. Detailed data such
as the number of devices
on the market and their use
are also unknown. In other
words, there is no way to
do statistical analysis on
a device behaviour, and
neither patients nor their
doctors can take informed
decisions.
Secondly, we would
expect regulations
surrounding the health
domain to be extremely
rigid. The reality is,
regulations are a bit more
lenient in the medical
device industry. Some
devices sold on the market
have never been tested on
humans and only need to
provide “reasonable as-
surance” of the product’s
safety and effectiveness.
For some devices, it is
enough to be “substantial-
ly equivalent” to devices
already on the market or
to an earlier version of
the product. They also do
not need to demonstrate
that the device delivers a
benefit to the patient.
Moreover, Europe,
with some of the lightest
regulations in the devel-
oped world, is seen as a
“testing ground” for big
corporations, waiting to
see the success of their
products on the market
before selling it in the
US. From the data that
the ICIJ journalists could
gather during their inves-
tigation, it is expected that
the number of reports of
injuries due to medical
implants will dramatically
increase, doubling in the
UK in nine years, either
due to improved report
practice or an increase in
injuries.
Thirdly, lobbyism plays
a role as well. When a
market is concerned by
regulations, the compa-
nies involved intervene
with representatives to
attempt to have their
viewpoint protected by
politicians. For nine years,
lobbyists put pressure on
representatives during
the rewriting of plans to
reform Europe’s safety
rules. During the whole
process, as the ICIJ jour-
nalists claim, lobbyists
fought to keep as much as
possible from the “light-
touch safety regime”.
Currently, the regime
in Europe uses a range
of for-profit certification
firms, the “notified
bodies”, to approve new
devices for market release
on behalf of the European
Union if they conform
with the regulations. They
are supposed to look
through technical files
that truthfully describe
the devices, including
issues and testing, and
then decide whether they
meet the regulations.
Sometimes, notified
bodies might have never
seen these files and might
have loosely awarded
the CE certificates to
unsafe implants for the
companies that pay them
for their services. The
European Commission
proposed to transfer re-
sponsibility for assessing
high-risk devices to a
new department within
the European Medicines
Agency.In2012,however,
a centralized regulator
was deemed “inappro-
priate”. According to the
Journalists investigators,
the commission repeated
lobbyist’s arguments: in-
creased costs for hospitals
with no increased safety
to European citizens.
Although there is no
fundamental change in
the structure, new reg-
ulations will push for a
stricter control of medical
devices.
It is important to note,
however, that despite the
harm that has been caused
by faulty medical devices,
the general effect of the
devices on health is mas-
sively positive. Nothing
is black and white. Health
manufacturers don’t focus
primarily on increasing
revenue and decreasing
costs, but it is a consider-
ation they need to have to
keep the company up and
running, which will then
allow them to produce
more devices that can rev-
olutionize the healthcare
domain. Regulations do
fail, but they still protect
us from many mistakes.
We can decide to leave
things as they are, but as
the next generation of
scientists and engineers,
we believe it is our role
to positively contribute.
Moral issues and fairness
to stakeholders should be
considered when creating
any device. When reg-
ulating them, ethical
behaviour is important
because finding dangers
in a truthful description of
a device is easier than ana-
lysing lies. Finally, even
after devices have been
released, follow-up is
essential, and we believe
this area is dramatically
under-developed and
would have massive
impacts in the long run.
Scandals and criticism
are central to raise aware-
ness but constructively
working with all parties
involved is even more
vital.
