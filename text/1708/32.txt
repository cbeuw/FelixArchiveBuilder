unday 18th
November saw
14 members of
Imperial College
Union Taekwondo
(ICUTKD) competing in
the nationwide Autumn
Championships and
London University Sports
League (LUSL) in East
London.
The team brought back
three gold, three silver
and seven bronze medals.
ICUTKD travelled
as a team from Notting
Hill Gate to Jean Brown
Indoor Sports Arena at
dawn for registration and
weigh-in.
Regardless of level of
experience everyone was
nervous (and hungry).
After waiting in the
team fort for what felt like
hours, the competition
began. It was time to show
what they had prepared
for weeks!
This was the first of
three league national
student taekwondo com-
petitions for the academic
year.
The scale of the
competition had grown,
newly consisting of World
Taekwondo (WT) and
International Taekwondo
Federation (ITF) patterns
from this year.
In addition to this was
the annual WT sparring.
Also new this year for
the club was an exciting
opportunity to take over
the Imperial College
Instagram account on the
day.
With the team were
four coaches and other
students from the club,
who supported each and
every patterns perfor-
mance and fights.
From the first poomsae
there was a crowd of
familiar faces cheering.
Some highlights with
outstanding performance
in patterns came from
Lucy Lei (silver), Andrew
Bates (silver) and Cynthia
Ho (bronze) from C class,
and Wenbo Chen (bronze)
and Bryan Chong (gold)
from A class.
After a short break,
there was an adrenaline
rush as competition draws
were up on the wall.
Once again, members
gathered to cheer outside
the ring for every kick
thrown.
We were especially
delighted to have the
opportunity to enter ITF
practitioners into the com-
petitions.
“The team
brought
back three
gold, three
silver and
seven bronze
medals”
Wenbo Chen, Angela
Sun, Fatima Khan and
Savya Arggawal all
brought back bronze
medals.
Many fighters had more
than one round and refu-
elled vigorously in breaks.
Nick Hyunh (gold) and
Johnny Kim (gold) were
exhausted by the end of
the day, having won all
three rounds.
Special thanks to
Johnny who returned to
compete as an alumnus
representing Imperial.
Thomas Kloska
(bronze), a beginner in
taekwondo, competed in
both WT poomsae and
sparring.
Claire Tjokrowidjaja
(bronze), competed in
both ITF and WT sparring
for the first time!
We applaud everyone
in the club for competing
regardless of gaining a
medal.
Competing provides
an amazing chance to
learn about everyone’s
strengths and weaknesses,
which are addressed in
further training.
Many thanks to club
volunteers and to our
coaches who spend ex-
traordinarily large propor-
tion of their time for us.
For readers who are
unfamiliar to the amazing
sports that is taekwondo,
it is a Korean martial arts
that has been a part of the
Olympics since 2000.
Student competitions
by British Student Taek-
wondo Federation (BSTF)
are open to all students
and alumni of all levels
(A, B, C class), including
all genders, background
and experience.
Sparring is then cat-
egorised by gender and
weight.
Points can be scored
with kicks to the head,
body and punches, with a
bonus for spinning kicks.
A class WT sparring
uses electronic equipment,
as done in international
competitions.
These are all under the
careful supervision of the
central referee and corner
judges to guarantee fair
scoring.
Historically, November
was when the Imperial
College Open (ICO) was
held, which has been
organised by ICUTKD
from 2012. The aim was
to introduce more taek-
wondo competitions in
the academic year. ICO
was the only national
competition organised
by students and started
on our home ground in
Ethos. The popularity
grew exponentially.
After five years of
successful consecutive
student-led competitions,
the BSTF stepped in to
help in 2017.
Now, what was ICO
has been incorporated into
a series of league champi-
onships.
Although we are no
longer part of the organ-
ising team, we are proud
to have reached our initial
goal of expanding oppor-
tunities for students to
compete.
ICUTKD was ranked
4th overall from the
Autumn Championship
out of 34 universities.
Every hour practising,
training and controlling
weight was worth it.
Next, we will travel
to Nottingham on 17th
February for another day
of fierce competition.
We will do our best to
continue training hard and
representing our universi-
ty.
Equally importantly,
we will continue having
fun, supporting each other
and pushing ourselves to
our limits!
