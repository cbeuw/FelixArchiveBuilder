Rigoletto
| Singers
outshined by
set
powerful men, a woman (or
several), and an assassi-
nation plot fit right into the
scene. The philandering Duke
and his posse of henchmen
are easily transposed from
nobility to gang life; the
titular court jester, Rigoletto,
becomes a bartender at the
bar they frequent. His daugh-
ter Gilda remains the innocent
girl unaware of the menacing
world around her, and her
ill-usage at the hands of the
Duke and his men point to the
subordinate role of women in
a very much male-dominated
world. The Duke’s henchmen
exclaim over Gilda’s pure and
innocent beauty, but have
no qualms kidnapping her
for revenge on Rigoletto; the
Duke himself professes con-
cern for his “beloved angel”,
but does not hesitate to rape
and abandon her afterward.
Sparafucile, the contract
killer hired by Rigoletto in his
vendetta against the Duke, is
perhaps even more at home
with a fedora and a switch-
blade than he was in Verdi’s
16th
century Mantua.
The first performance of this
production was in 1982, but
the set seems as fresh as ever.
A stylish bar – all oak panel-
ling and mirrors – serves as
the Duke’s headquarters. The
hordes of suit-clad henchmen
in sunglasses lend a distinct
Men in Black air to the
scenes. As Rigoletto leaves
the bar for his home, the
shadowy figure of Sparafu-
cile emerges from a dark
and foggy alleyway to make
his proposition. The set of
the last act provides a great
contrast between the well-lit
tawdry bar in which the Duke
flirts with Sparafucile’s sister
Maddalena, and the thunder
and lightning outside as Gilda
looks on, steeling herself for a
fatal sacrifice.
If only the cast lived up to
these promising surroundings.
The three main roles are
sung by American singers
imported from across the
pond, but none of them are
particularly outstanding.
Playing the Duke, Joshua
Guerrero’s voice was too
phlegmatic to make either a
convincing mafia boss or a
compelling Casanova. Worse
still was Nicholas Pallesen,
whose Rigoletto fell terribly
flat. It felt like he was merely
declaiming his lines with no
emotion behind them; instead
of moving the audience to
horror and pity, Pallesen
succeeded only in arousing
faint boredom. Apparently he
was suffering from a cold on
opening night, but whether
he can bring out the role’s
full potential remains to be
seen. Sydney Mancasola was
perhaps the saving grace,
with her clear but somewhat
timid voice quite suited to the
role of Gilda. Perhaps ENO
should just stick to British sing-
ers – Barnaby Rea deserves
a special mention for his
brooding Sparafucile, as
does Madeleine Shaw for her
provocative Maddalena.
This run of Rigoletto has
almost everything going for
it: great direction, great set,
the 13th
revival of a well-
loved production. But it is
undoubtedly hampered by
its uninspiring cast. Jonathan
Miller’s Rigoletto has the
potential to be a crowd-draw-
ing classic – if only ENO finds
the right people for the job.
Rigoletto is on at the ENO
until the 28th
of February.
Tickets from £12.

arginalia
are the
annotations
one finds
scribbled
in the
margins of a text; they
can be insightful, witty or
rude depending on the
commentator in question.
Reading Drawings is a new
collection at the Courtauld
Gallery that aims to showcase
the equivalent in drawings
– inscriptions on sketches
dating from the 16th
to the 20th
century.
Unlike the marginalia in
books, where readers jot
down their thoughts on the
text, writings on drawings
are more often done by the
artists themselves, and on
rough sketches rather than
the final masterpiece. As
signatures are possibly the
most natural mark to make on
an artwork, a variety are on
display in Reading Drawings.
Particularly interesting are
instances of drawings signed
by someone else. One such
example is a sketch of a
female nude purportedly by
Auguste Rodin: the "unchar-
acteristically even pressure"
in the false signature suggests
instead the work of the forger,
Hand B. In contrast, the hand-
writing of a reliable collector
helps to identify the creator of
a sketch from the 18th
century.
Unrelated notes on sketches
also provide amusing insights
about the artists who wrote
them. An ancient grocery list
from the 15th
century makes
an appearance, as do a
painter’s musings about the
amount of money he is soon
to be paid.
Despite its efforts at making
ancient scribbles interesting,
Reading Drawings remains
slightly too academic for the
general public. The exhibition
is small, with only 20-odd
sketches, but manages to
suffer from a lack of organ-
isation: the introduction
to the exhibition is placed
awkwardly in a far corner
and there is no indication as
to any order or arrangement
in which one should view the
displays. Moreover, despite
the title ‘Reading Drawings’,
the inscriptions are not actu-
ally transcribed or translated
for the viewers to read. With-
out excellent eyesight and
knowledge of Latin, Dutch or
Italian, viewers can only rely
upon the curator’s interpreta-
tion and comments to make
sense of the writing on the
drawings; this leaves one
feeling rather unsatisfied.
However, Reading Draw-
ings is only a part of the
much larger attraction that
is the Courtauld Gallery's
permanent collection of
world-famous paintings. Stop
at Reading Drawings along
the way if time permits, but if
not – it’s no great loss either.
Reading Drawings is on at
the Courtauld Gallery until
the 4th
of June. Free entry to
students.

t’s never a good sign
when the set outshines the
main cast. Unfortunately
for the ENO’s latest
rendition of Jonathan
Miller’s superbly
conceptualised Rigoletto, this
is very much the case.
Miller takes us back to
1950s New York City, in the
shadier Mafia-dominated
parts of Little Italy. It is a curi-
ously appropriate retelling
of the drama of Rigoletto:
T
oday, when we
live in much more
tolerant and
inclusive times
than those in the
past, it is really important
to remember that even a
term such as ‘LGBT’ can
sometimes forget to include
certain groups of people,
necessitating the term
‘LGBT+’. One such group
that is often completely
forgotten about in the
discussion of sexuality
is in fact the situation
when a person does
not experience
sexual attraction.
Asexuality.
While it is of
course common
for a character in a
show to not display
any signs of sexuality,
just think of most children’s
shows, what is incredibly
rare is a character openly
identifying as asexual or
aromantic. One could argue
that a character like Sheldon
Cooper from The Big Bang
Theory could be read as
identifying as asexual,
however, this portrayal is far
from helpful or sensitive to the
community. It’s more written
as a result of his lack of social
skills or empathy rather than
an intrinsic part of his identity.
The only character in main-
stream media that I’m aware
of to identify as asexual is
Todd Chavez from Bojack
Horseman, a Netflix original.
In the finale of Season 3,
after a whole season’s worth
of Todd and his high-school
girlfriend, Emily skimming
around the ‘Will they, won’t
they?’ trope, their relationship
culminates in a conversation
in a diner, in which Emily asks
about his sexuality and he
replies “I’m not gay, I mean,
I don’t think I am, but I don’t
think I’m straight, either. I
don’t know what I am, I think
I might be nothing.”, not
only would this be a big step
forward for the asexual com-
munity but Emily’s response
is great too. She simply says
“That’s okay.” She doesn’t
assume it’s something she
can fix, it’s not something that
requires follow-up questions.
It’s just who he is, and a

program showing how to
respond when someone tells
you who they are is nearly
as important as making these
visible in the first place.
How Todd’s identity goes on
to shape his character, and
his interactions with others
remains yet to be seen, but I
trust that Raphael Bob-Waks-
berg and the other writers of
Bojack Horseman will treat it
with dignity.

German Cornejo
and his sizzling dance crew
return to London with Tango
Fire to set the stage ablaze.
The first part of the show
harks back to tango’s roots
in the milongas of Buenos
Aires. Impossibly glamor-
ous, the five couples make
their entrance with a slow
tango foxtrot that gradu-
ally builds up to a fast and
flirtatious dance. Machismo
and coquetry abound; the
men show off their moves to
impress the ladies, who turn
up their noses and trifle with
their fans. It’s nice to see that
Cornejo has also included
some diverting male-only
sequences, which lend a
touch of humour to the scene.
The show is divided into
two halves, with 13 pieces in
each hour-long segment. Time
flies with the mind-boggling
variety of sets. With minimal
staging and costumes, each
performance tells a different
story: velvet drapes and
opera gloves for burlesque,
festoon lights and flowers
for an evening party. But the
focus is rightly on the quality
of dancing. Between tango
performances, the live band,
Quarteto Fuego (Fire Quar-
tet), and singer Jesus Hidalgo
entertain the audience with
their soulful tunes.
One caveat: Hidalgo’s
emotive crooning is all very
well, but it’s a bit hard to
appreciate the sadness

Cielo de Estrellas (Beneath

Lopez and Camila Alegre
prove their worth as 2015
Tango World Champions:
Alegre is light as a bird in
their complicated routines,
and their footwork is fast as
lightning. Cornejo and his
partner Gisela Galeassi are
excellent as well, pulling off
difficult lifts and spins with
dexterity and finesse. On the
other hand, the acrobatics of
the couple Sebastian Alvarez
and Victoria Saudelli are
somewhat lacking in grace
despite their routine packed
with flashy moves.
Cornejo’s flair for choreog-
raphy is strong in the group
dances, which are all very
enjoyable. There are plenty of
fishnets and lace, as is to be
expected, but let it not be said
that Cornejo is entirely lack-
ing in subtlety. Oblivion, an
evocative piece in the second
half, has an interesting con-
temporary feel to it – the girls
in their flowing white dresses
almost evoke the ballet danc-
ers of Les Sylphides.
You don’t need to be a
tango aficionado for the raw
appeal of Tango Fire’s bold
and flamboyant dancing. This
is tango unabashedly for the
stage, performed by some
of the best dancers around.
A great show for a night of
entertainment!
