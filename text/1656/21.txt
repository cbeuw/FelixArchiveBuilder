Bored of the classic waffle? Me too!
Christy tries to go out of her comfort zone and goes to a new place with a dress-code that serves
the fanciest waffles in town, no matter if they are sweet or not, even if they do not reach up her
high expectations.

Y
ou should
never make a
comment about
a restaurant
before you’ve
tried it.”
That was a strong lesson
from a man, a total stranger,
sitting at the table next to me,
which ended our morning
debate over the much hyped-
about The Breakfast Club a
few months back. For him, it
was his holy grail breakfast
place. For me, an overly
hyped-up place with ridicu-
lous queues serving average
American-style breakfast
dishes.
While I still have yet to visit
The Breakfast Club to this
date, his words had struck a
spark of fire inside me – the
courage to try all these new
and exciting restaurants in
London, especially those I
have been wanting to visit,
but prevented by that preju-
dice I’ve formed in my head.
One of those restaurants at
the top of my list was Duck
and Waffle. The highest
restaurant in London residing
on the 40th
floor of the Heron
Tower. The restaurant that
was so arrogant you have to
reserve your table two months
in advance, despite it being
open 24/7. The restaurant
that I have always had a
major grudge against for
turning me away from a 7:30
walk-in attempt on a Wednes-
day morning.
It wasn’t only their pure
arrogance that put out the
flame of curiosity deep inside
my heart. It was the con-
trasting reviews from excited
captions on how amazing
the food is with the glorious
sunrise, to paying for the view
rather than the only-average
food. These voices had been
debating in my head for
months and months, kicking
the idea of visiting further
and further to the back of my
mind. But finally, I’ve decided
to find out for myself, with my
own taste buds.
It was quite a spontaneous
decision. I was sitting at the
back of the lecture theatre
feeling miserable for myself
for sitting through yet another
hour of the lecturer’s slow,
droning voice, and how I
deserved a nice breakfast to
treat myself. The next moment
I found myself on Duck and
Waffle’s reservation page,
desperately clicking on every
single date for the next 2
months, in search for a slot at
a reasonable time among all
the “We apologise: there is
no availability at that time.”
and a handful of 6am slots
(6am is NOT reasonable). I
laughed at myself for putting
in such effort, until the page
loaded for the 20th
time…
Landed a table at 8:30am on
a Tuesday morning a week
away.
That was like winning the
jackpot.
That morning, we dragged
ourselves out of bed bright
and early, rubbed our
groggy, sleepy eyes in the
commuter-packed tube
journey to Liverpool Street,
and stared up the shiny, glass
building of the Heron Tower.
We entered the door to the
reception of Duck and Waffle
and Sushi Samba, and was
met by a hostess with an unex-
pectedly sloppy attitude, who
took my name and pointed
us to the right – a security
guard.
I discreetly rolled my eyes as
the guard swiped his detector
under my armpit. Yup, arro-
gance, check.
Now, the fun part. The
glass lift shot us straight up
from ground to the 40th
floor
like those capsules in sci-fi
movies. The door opened to
a stylish bar, beautiful blue,
tiled floors, and a handsome
bartender who pointed to yet
another reception.
We were led further into the
main part of the restaurant: a
modern, spacious room with
crystal clear, floor-to-ceil-
ing windows, sofas, marble
tables and an open kitchen.
We were seated right by the
window, over-looking the
thick blanket of fog blanking
out the view. (Typical British
winter weather.)
We made ourselves com-
fortable, looking around at
the other diners who were all
adhering to the strict dress
code. The room was half-
empty (or half-full, if you are
the optimistic kind), relighting
my grudge for being shooed
away from a walk-in. Maybe
they wanted to keep that
prestigious, oh-we-don’t-open-
to-random-people sort of
image?
Putting that aside, we
glanced over the menu and
swiftly decided on two of
their waffle dishes. For the
savoury, their signature duck
and waffle, and for the sweet,
their caramelized banana
waffle. Plus coffee to wake
us up.
Our waffles arrived at our
table in a moment, while the
coffee took their time (coffee
ended up just average so I’ll
skip that). Both dishes looked
absolutely amazing, or, in my
words, Instagrammable.
The duck and waffle was a
simple construction of half a
waffle with a duck leg confit,
fried to a crispy, golden
brown, a glossy fried duck
egg on top and a little jug
of mustard maple syrup on
the side. Wrapped inside the
crispy skin of the duck confit
was shreds of juicy, tender
meat, surprisingly not greasy.
The sweetness from the
maple syrup and the savoury
duck was like a match made
in heaven. The duck had
surpassed my prejudice and
expectations and earned itself
a round of applause. How-
ever, the waffle itself was just
an average waffle, nothing
exciting.
The caramelized banana
waffle was a bit of an anti-cli-
max as it didn’t have any of
the wow-factor compared
to the former dish. It was a
simple dish of waffles with
their house-made hazel-
nut and chocolate spread,
smooth vanilla ice cream and
a banana, split in half along
its length, caramelized and
skilfully balanced on top. Per-
haps my expectations were
too high – it was just waffles
after all.
Thirty minutes had barely
passed and we were scraping
the last crumbs off our plates.
Duck and Waffle, despite
the slightly unprofessional
service, was an eye-opening
dining experience and is defi-
nitely worth a visit. Food-wise,
stick to the duck and waffle –
quoting my lovely companion:
“The restaurant is called that
for a reason.”
Valentine’s sweets
Try to do something else for your special someone with this step-by-step guide for calorie-heavy
sweets and you’ll never again buy chocolate truffles!
C
an you smell
it? Try again! I
know you can,
but maybe
you’ve just got
used to it as
it’s been here for some days
already: LOVE. Oh, yes,
you’ve heard me right. In case
you didn’t realise, Valentine’s
is coming in less than a week
now. And if you are alone, it’s
time to worry – you cannot
spend one more Valentine’s
alone. Again! If you are with
someone, it’s time to worry –
you really want to make sure
that they do still love you as
much as they did in the first
day.
As it’s said, the path to
someone’s heart is through
their stomach, so you can
make sure that the love of
your life (this week) will know
how much you love her/
him by sharing some sweets.
And because we are in the
food section here, it’s easy to
imagine that I don’t propose
you to go and buy some
fancy over-priced chocolates,
but to bake your love and
sweat (maybe less sweat,
more love) into something
special.
Chocolate truffles
This year was the first I’ve
ever tried to make such things
and I loved them! I mean,
everybody loved them – so
much that there was none left
after two hours. Easy to make
and very effective.
Ingredients:
3 cups high quality chocolate
(preferably chips so you
don’t have to chop it)
1 cup heavy whipping cream
1 tsp vanilla extract
½ tsp cinnamon
cocoa powder – again, look
for something that is higher
quality, not cheaper
Melt the chocolate for a
couple minutes. Keep in mind
that you don’t have to com-
pletely melt it, but to soften it
a bit. At the same time, heat
the cream to a simmer. Add
the vanilla and cinnamon. If
you feel like it, you can add
some other flavours – mint,
rum – but keep in mind that
you cannot mix everything so
you might need to prepare
different batches for different
flavours.
On the top of chocolate,
add the heavy cream and stir
until smooth. Let it cool a bit
and then refrigerate it for two
hours.
Take the mixture out and,
using a teaspoon, roll out little
balls of chocolate. Roll them
in the cocoa powder and
place on baking paper – or
any other kind of non-sticky
paper. Place in the refriger-
ator overnight. At this point,
you might have to watch over
it for the whole night so you
can make sure that they’ll still
be there in the morning.
Also, keep in mind that you
Ingredients:
6 tbsp melted unsalted butter
1 cup chocolate (chips or
chopped)
2 cups flour
1 cup sugar
2 eggs
1 tsp baking powder
1 tsp baking soda
1/3 cup cocoa powder
Nutella
½ tsp salt
1 cup butter milk
1/3 cup chocolate chips
1 tsp cinnamon
can also roll them in chopped
nuts or anything else, really.

pink decorations you find
everywhere this time of the
year. Just don’t overdo it!
Simple is better in this case.
Now, go and impress them!
water – this is how a real
chef would do, but if you feel
that’s too complicated, use
the always-there-when-you-
need-it microwave. Stir from
time to time until completely
melted and smooth.
For the first step you’ll
need a rather large bowl.
Whisk together the flour,
sugar, cocoa powder, baking
powder and soda – you may
wonder why you need them
both; you should go and do
some research, that’s why
you are an Imperial student
– salt and cinnamon. In
another bowl, whisk the eggs
and the butter milk until well
combined. Add the melted
chocolate and butter and mix
until smooth.
Pour the liquid ingredients
over the dry ones and mix
with a spatula. Make sure
that all the ingredients are
well incorporated. Add the
rest of the chocolate chips
and make sure that the mix-
ture is homogeneous, but do
not over mix the batter.
Divide the mixture equally
in the muffin cups. Put a tsp
of the batter, add a tsp of
Nutella and then cover with
more batter.
Bake for 15-20 minutes.
And now, feel guilty
every time you have a bite
of one of these definite-
ly-too-much-chocolate muffins,
but tell yourself that you’ll find
your true love despite those
stomach rolls – yes, I can see
them from over here.

Chocolate muffins
As expected, this is a bit
more complicated recipe, but
overall, it’s faster as it doesn’t
require any sitting and refrig-
erating. In the same time, it
has plenty of opportunities
for you to fuck up. But hey,
at least, you’ve tried! Don’t
be intimidated by a couple of
possible mistakes. I think I’ve
baked over 100 muffins in
my life (if you do some math,
you’ll see that this is not that
much, but… I try to impress
you, pretentious reader!) and
I still have times when they
are just ‘OK’, not ‘perfect’.
Preheat the oven to 175ºC
and spray a muffin tin with
cooking spray. Make sure
that you have plenty of time
and a lot of bowls – I person-
ally always use ten too many
bowls.
