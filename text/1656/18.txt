Drake:
The Boy
Meets
World
Tour
D
esiigner’s Panda
played in the O2
arena as I sat
high up waiting
for Drake to take
to the stage, so
high up that I genuinely had
a nosebleed during the show.
I couldn’t help but overhear
the comments of the girls
sitting beside me. “I’m so glad
they made a song about my
favourite animal”, one said
whilst her friend dabbed a
bit too enthusiastically. I find
myself switching from Drizzy
fan boy to Drizzy hater on
a regular basis. How many
hip-hop artists could sell out
the O2 for so many dates?
On the other hand, his music
has infiltrated the mainstream
to such an extent that his core
fan base is starting to consist
largely of a group that don’t
appreciate many other hip-
hop artists. Is this good for the
culture?
All of my questions disap-
peared as soon as the lights
dimmed and the horns of
Trophies started to blear.
What ensued was an hour
and a half of pure energy,
with the six god rattling off
tune after tune, and the crowd
eating up every second of it.
From performing the hooks of
classic hits such as Headlines,
Over and The Motto to more
recent bangers, including
Fake Love and Hotline Bling,
Drake’s enthusiasm had
onlookers jumping all night.
Drake flexed his vocals on
the slower, more romantic
Find Your Love and Feel No
Ways, and well as the more
upbeat Work and Too Good.
He proclaimed, “You know
you have to play the RiRi
tunes to make the gyal dem
feel sexy”. He switched up
the vibe throughout, sensing
when to play his more upbeat
songs yelling, “I’m tryna
do a show for the people, I
ain’t tryna fuck nobody right
now!” at his keyboard player.
Drake’s obsession with
London and the UK grime
scene was evidenced as
he brought London’s Dave,
Giggs and Kyla out to join
him on stage, much to the
audience’s excitement. Dave
joined forces with Drake
to perform their hit single,
Wanna Know Remix. Giggs
was the next guest, perform-
ing Whippin Excursion, and
making Aubrey go full fan
boy for the five minutes that
he was on stage.
In a brief intermission, we
were treated to a preview of
a Drake and Giggs’ collab-
oration and a giant light-up
globe rose through the centre
of the stage. Drake returned
to the stage to perform Pop
Style leading nicely into
Know Yourself. The crowd
went off as Drake screamed
“I was running through the
six with my woes” and it was
by far the most hyped part of
the of the show. Drake ended
the show declaring, “If I die,
Imma die a legend”.

Tired of the same old songs, or just like listening to live music? The new music scene in London is
vibrant and flourishing, beginning with the Roundhouse Rising Festival next week.
P
art of the allure of
moving to London
for music lovers
is the incredible
access to up and
coming artists.
Many times while living
here, I’ve high-fived myself
for gaining hipster points
after discovering artists
who’ve yet to break into the
charts. Vanity aside, the
ease with which Londoners
can listen to new sounds
and find quality acts is
exciting and inspiring.
But how to sort the wheat
from the chaff? Not every
artist at your local is going
to be the next Jack Garratt.
Luckily, there are passionate
people working in the
industry that do the hard part
for you.
Next week is Roundhouse
Rising Festival at the Round-
house, Camden. Not only
does it host nine days worth
of live music from multiple
genres, it holds workshops
with industry leaders to help
emerging talent get an edge
on breaking. This year it’s
celebrating the huge success
of rapper Little Simz, who
played the festival in 2014.
The following year she
released her debut album,
which reached number 20
on the UK R&B album charts,
and she will be headlining the
festival this year.
For the acoustically prefer-
enced, there’s Sofar Sounds.
A programme started in
2009, it has spread from
London to over 200 cities
songwriters and bands, which
you can enjoy while snuggled
in your Primark onesie.
Keeping your hipster card
valid in London can be a
hard ask, especially when
half your week is spent in
labs (don’t take it from me,
I never have labs), but don’t
let that stop you from hearing
incredible music from all over
the city. Fortunately, here in
London, there’s more to new
sound than Spotify’s Discover
playlist.

worldwide. The exact venue
and location isn’t released
until the day of the event. This
exclusive air is added to by
only around 50 invites being
extended to an applicant
pool which can number in the
thousands.
Another acoustic evening,
Sessions 58 is at the Looking
Glass Cocktail Club, Shored-
itch. Hosting fresh talent in
music, poetry, and spoken
word from around the UK,
this cosy evening is like being
invited to your musical friend’s
living room for drinks.
If you’re reading this
thinking “It’s February, why
would I leave the house?”,
then London Live TV’s Live
Sessions on Friday evenings is
for you. This show broadcasts
live performances from local
London’s new music scene
