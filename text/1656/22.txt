Beingnon-binaryatImperialisnotfun
One Imperial student discusses their time at uni, wishing things would “get better” faster
T
here is a
misconception
held by many
queer secondary
school students
that universities
are very progressive and
tolerant places. The It gets
better project is all but built
on this idea promoted by
society that it’s okay if times
are tough now, because one
day you will escape your
small town. You will travel
to a big city where what
once made you different
and ostracised will make you
popular and interesting. This
is a nice narrative, but it’s a
slow burner, there is no telling
when exactly things will ‘get
and it took the first term for
me to realise the futility of
reasoned debate but by then
a lot of the damage had been
done. It took me two years
to start recovering from my
resulting severe depression,
social anxiety and agorapho-
bia that resulted.
Male students were more
aggressive than their female
counterparts, often coming
across as personally offended
by my lack of femininity. At
my first CGCU ball I lost count
of the number of times I was
asked why I was wearing
a suit with some people
repeatedly offering to buy
me a dress for the next time,
insisting it was “too weird” for
me to not wear a dress.
In halls I was the first trans
person most had met, and for
a few, the first gay person.
Most laughed and said “they
didn’t understand, it was
too confusing” and that was
that, but there were other
responses too: “Do you have
a vagina?”, “You’re too
pretty to be gay”, “So you’re
bicurious?”, and my personal
favourite, “No you’re not,
that’s not real”. The people
I wasn’t out to led to some
interesting insights. When
asked about trans people one
housemate said: “They all
live in some freak-town some-
where”. I must have missed
my eviction notice.
One of these male ‘friends’,
would try and convince me
every time he got drunk
that I was straight and that
homosexuality wasn’t a real
thing. This lasted two months,
and would often happen
in crowded rooms. No one
ever said anything. How
is a queer student meant to
feel safe and know they’re
not disgusting when so many
‘allies’ sit by and say nothing?
What about a non-binary
student, with no legal gender
recognition, knowing if they
do try to make a complaint
to hall officers, it’ll have to
be preceded by a ten minute
trans 101 talk, so they can
even grasp why you’re upset.
The supposed society for
LGBT people, IQ had a rep-
utation at the time of being
a group of “cis, gay white
guys”, and the IQ women’s
group was hyper-feminine
to an extent that I found
uncomfortable. I viewed it
as just one more place to be
harassed, if I wasn’t a girl or
a guy where was I supposed
to go? IQ has since improved
greatly, now with trans
officers, and the women’s
group openly welcoming
non-binary individuals.
Things alleviated for me in
later years, I joined Women’s
Rugby and the Feminist
society – they were the first
places I felt safe at Imperial.
I’m now in fourth year, and
students that didn’t under-
stand at all in first year, now
share my trans friends. These
experiences aren’t totally
isolated to first year though, I
a week have to explain “I’m
not a boy”. In areas where
there’s drinking it’s worse, I’ve
been asked about my genitals
multiple times, and recently
was half-dragged out of the
toilets by a girl.
Imperial doesn’t do enough
to support and reach out to
queer students who are likely
to be the victim of harass-
ment and experience poor
mental health while under
their care. They give us three
talks a year on plagiarism
and its penalties, but none
on what is inappropriate and
offensive behaviour towards
any marginalised group. In
halls they bundle up to 300
students in a limited space,
take your money, and then
wish you luck. Being made to
find yourself disgusting and
intolerable for something so
inherent to your being, such
as your gender identity, such
as your sexuality, is a cruel
act. Unfortunately I am not
alone in this experience, with
it potentially having the worst
of consequences, 35 to 48%
of trans people attempting
suicide before the age of 26.
This is a widespread problem,
and there is a lack of support,
education, awareness, and
clear punishments for harass-
ing students.
It’s taken a few years, but
I’ve eventually found an
accepting group of friends
who use my correct pronouns
and accept me for who I am.
You shouldn’t have to suffer
so someone else can become
educated, but there’s at least
sometimes some positive out-
come of it. In answer to the “It
gets better” narrative, it may
do, but it won’t always be an
easy journey. I will be gradu-
ating this year, and have had
some amazing experiences
and learned so much but to
me Imperial will always be
the place that could have
been so much better.

on my course last year to use
my pronouns/chosen name,
most still call me she/her and
by my old name. I got in a
fight with a friend who told
me I needed “psychiatric

students by and large are
quite uninformed, for me it
just wouldn’t be worth it.

FuckValentine’sDay|Asexualandaromantic
Joanna Wormald doesn’t really have anything against V Day, but they do mind the complete
invisibility of asexuals and aromantics in mainstream culture
T
he first two weeks
in February are an
infernal nightmare
of constant
bombardment with
advertisements
for jewellery, chocolates,
and lingerie – all for that
‘special someone’. People
in relationships presumably
don’t mind. Single people
complain incessantly about
it. For aromantics however,
Valentine’s Day represents a
whole new level of hell. One
which is at best an irritation.
On a bad day, it can provoke
outright nausea.
scientifically inaccurate jokes
about plants, mitosis, and
robots. Not coming out comes
with its own problems –
namely the age-old question
“When will you get a boy-
friend/girlfriend?”. No matter
how often you try to explain
that you’re not interested (or
that there are more than two
genders) people always seem
to think they know what’s
best for you. The first thing I
heard after coming out was
“Don’t worry, you’ll find
someone”. It’s astonishing that
anyone could so spectacu-
larly ignore everything they
had just heard. The whole
point is I don’t want to find
someone. Being alone is not
an inherently terrible experi-
ence. Don’t pity us because
you assume that being single
is a universally sad state of
affairs. Explaining this to
people usually earns the
condescending line “you’ll
change your mind when you
get older”. It gets worse when
people think they can change
your mind or tell you that you
need to be on medication
because you’re not normal.
As with most minorities,
stereotyping is a huge issue.
If aromantic asexuals are por-
trayed as cold and heartless,
we’re also infantilised. Apathy
is not the same as ignorance.
We’re not all naïve and
innocent. We understand sex
jokes. In fact it’s not uncom-
mon for an asexual to be the
first person to make a joke
just so they can be seen to fit
in. Non-asexual aromantics
are viewed as promiscuous,
especially female aros. And
if a non-aromantic asexual
enters into a relationship
but still doesn’t want to have
sex, they’re accused of being
cruel, even abusive towards
their partner.
Valentine’s Day itself isn’t
the issue, it’s just the most
obvious symptom. The
problem is the assumption
that everybody wants and
needs to be in a romantic and
sexual relationship in order
to be happy and fulfilled. The
truth is we don’t. Emotional
energy is just as rewarding
when it’s invested in friends or
family. Plenty of us are happy
without any kind of committed
relationship whatsoever. But
the concept of settling down,
in media or in classrooms.
You could live your whole
life never knowing that we
exist. Realising you’re not
feeling something is a difficult
process full of doubt. We
know that we’re different
from most people (although
it takes a long time to
work out that other people
genuinely are interested in
dating and not just faking
it) but we don’t know why.
It’s not hard to understand
why so many of us grow
up feeling broken – there’s
nobody telling us that we’re
\\ Hardly anyone
knows we exist,

We are, put simply, people
that do not experience
romantic attraction. If
you’re asexual too (lack
of sexual attraction if you
hadn’t already guessed) you
get hit twice as hard since
for many people, sex and
romance are inseparable.
Hardly anyone knows we
exist, which seems strange
considering there are more
of us than people currently
living in the UK. Even within
the LGBT+ community we are
often overlooked. Identities
on the aromantic and asexual
spectra – those which
experience occasional or
conditional attraction – are
even less well known.

not. It’s time that aromanti-
cism and asexuality became
commonplace concepts. We
need representation on our
screens and education in
our schools. Young people
especially ought to be aware
that not feeling things doesn’t
lessen them in any way. We’re
not broken, we’re just not
interested. We shouldn’t have
to constantly explain and
defend ourselves. Let us be
proud of who and what we

as some kind of ultimate goal

Sex and romance pervade
almost every film, book and

or asexual this is treated as
a joke or problem that needs

Holmes and Sheldon Cooper)
or completely ignored (the
Riverdale TV show is erasing
Jughead’s canonical asexual-
ity). This is where invisibility
really becomes a problem.
Aromanticism and asex-
uality aren’t talked about.
There’s no mention of them
are.
Hopefully in future, Val-
entine’s Day won’t be such
a harrowing time because it
will be seen as normal not
to want a romantic or sexual
relationship. Until then, I’ll
be following my annual
tradition of watching horror
movies (where any hint of a
relationship is destroyed by
a murderous monster) and
eating copious amounts of
discounted chocolate.
