Israeli ambassador’s visit | Wraith speaks up
One-sidedness of the event down to miscommunication
Matt Johnston
into a balanced one, as the
audience and speaker don’t
share the same platform.”
Snober concluded that they
could’ve handled the situation
better though: “We should
have made it clear what was
going on at the time and
what we’d want from such an
event if it were to go through.
Hopefully in the future we
will be able to get involved
in the organisation of such
events and ensure they are
as balanced as we can make
them.”
T
wo weeks ago the
Israeli ambassador
to the UK, Mark
Regev, visited
Imperial to give a
talk to students in
an event that was shrouded in
secrecy. An article detailing
what went on at the event
and the build-up to the day
itself was published in felix
last week but since then the
chair of the talk, Dr. Matthew
Wraith, and his students
have contested points in the
article (namely Palestinian
Society’s statement). A piece
on the subject can be found in
Comment, on page 8.
Most of the criticism stems
from the statement issued by
Palestinian Society that “it is
quite worrying that the College
did not think to invite an
opposing view to help balance
the conversation themselves.
This would’ve lead to a much
more open-minded and fruitful
discussion with different
perspective being expressed”.
Dr. Wraith, who had a large
part in the initial organisation
of the event, has in response
told felix that he had in fact
emailed Mohammed Snober,
the Palestinian Society
President, with an offer to
help in the organisation of the
ambassador’s visit at the start
of the process in October.
Wraith was advised by the
Events team to approach the
relevant societies but as he
didn’t want it to be a one-
sided event he approached
Palestinian Society as well as
Israeli Society. He contacted
PalSoc asking if they “would be
interested in taking an active
role in the organisation of this
event, helping to establish its
central focus, to organise and
publicise it beforehand and on
the day.”
However Wraith told felix
he received no reply. felix
reached out to Palestinian
Society for comment and they
felt that they weren’t explicitly
asked to provide another
speaker. “The initial email
proposed helping out with
organising and publicising the
event and deciding the focus
of the questions, rather than
expressing that the event was
open for an opposing speaker
to be present to challenge
the rhetoric presented by the
Israeli ambassador (if this was
the purpose of the invitation
we feel it could’ve been made
clear)”, said Mohammed
Snober, Palestinian Society
President.
The society’s silence was
due to commitments by their
members around that time,
both personal and educational
withSnoberadding“Wedidn’t
want to commit to an event and
attach the Palestinian society’s
name without our full focus
and dedication.” Palestinian
Society also felt that it wasn’t
wholly on them to provide
the opposing view: “While it
was much appreciated that
the society was approached
we do not feel that our lack of
involvement gives the College
a reason to not invite another
speaker. While opening the
floor to questions allows for a
healthy Q&A to take place, it
certainly doesn’t turn this event
King’s lecturer apologises for tweets
D
r Adam Perkins,
the King’s
lecturer who,
last week,
sparked public
outrage after a
series of offensive tweets were
brought to the attention of
King’s Intersectional Feminist
Community, has issued a
public apology on twitter.
In his apology which was
reportedly sent to King’s
Intersectional Feminist Society
last Thursday following felix’s
investigation, Perkins says:
“I would like to apologise
wholeheartedly for any
offence caused by my recent
social media posts concerning
use of the words “human
capital” and my discussion of
Swedish government data. It
was not my intention to cause
offence and my posts were
part of an ongoing effort to
understand disadvantage.”
“Research on individual
differences variables, such as
personality, inevitably entails
addressing sensitive topics
and scientists should be at
liberty to address challenging
scientific questions. I now
realise that such discussions
of data need to be conducted
with extra care and context.”
In the original tweets, Perkins
shared a statistic of “danish
data suggesting that welfare
benefits taste sweeter to some
cultures than others” and he
defended Trump’s Muslim
Ban saying it “makes sense in
human capital terms: people
from the banned nations
tend to be over-represented
in crime and unemployement
[sic] stats”.
His social media use came
under fire not only because
