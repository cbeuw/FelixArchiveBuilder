ebruary is LGBT history month (yes, I know
– I only just found out too) and my heart is
filled with joy because for the first time ever
I’m actually clued up. I also feel more a
part of the queer community than I’ve ever
felt before. I can’t really explain why, but it
is what it is and I’m glad, because being part of this
community is such a gift.
It might not seem like it, certainly not when it feels
like the whole world is against you, or when there’s this
invisible wall between your loved ones and yourself,
which somehow seems to scramble all communications.
It feels like more of a burden when strangers think they
have the liberty to tell you how to live, or when in the
eyes of the law you are a second-class citizen.
Still, as I’m sat in my office typing up this editorial
(so meta), all I can feel is pride – which I guess is
appropriate. I feel proud of being part of a community
of such beautiful, kind, strong people. I feel proud
of how many of you responded to our call for
contributions, how many of you opened up, shared
your experiences, the good and the bad; how many of
you put yourselves out there and whispered “I’m here.
We’re all here. For each other.”
Though I am concerned that many readers might
pick this up and just ‘not get it’, I also don’t really care.
Because as long as somebody out there gets to see it
and for a moment doesn’t feel alone, it was worth it,
even if all 2000 copies end up in the trash.
No matter how you feel about this issue, though, just
have an open mind. There’s some really beautiful, raw
content here this week. It could help you understand
your friends, your family, and even yourself. And when
you’re done, go give someone you love a hug.

Corrections | In the article “Zero tolerance policy gets scrapped”, which appeared in issue 1655, it should be noted that the newly chosen late coursework submission
policy will be a system that caps any late submissions at the pass mark, 24 hours after of which the work is zeroed. This was decided to be a more appropriate and
fairer option than a system with a graduated mark reduction.
