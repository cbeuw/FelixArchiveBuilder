ruvada is a
household name in
the gay community.
It is the name of
a small blue pill
containing two
antiretroviral compounds,
emtricitabine and tenofovir,
used to treat HIV. But Truvada
does so much more that carry
antiretroviral properties. It is
charged with symbolism and
packed with historic meaning.
Approved by the FDA in the
early noughties, it is one of
the first ‘combination’ treat-
ments developed to combat
HIV and the second combi-
nation treatment that was
developed without the highly
toxic AZT. For many HIV
patients, Truvada was and still
is a synonym to life. Before
1997, and despite the devel-
opment of multiple drugs,
HIV treatments were partly
efficacious monotherapies,
meaning treatment would
consist of a single drug. As
our understanding of the virus
improved we realised that
monotherapies allowed the
virus to mutate and develop
resistance, which explained
the poor results.
However, when the first
combination drug was
approved by the FDA in 1997,
life expectancies improved
greatly, allowing HIV positive
men and women to live
longer, fuller lives. And new
medical developments have
been reducing side-effects
and improving quality of life
ever since.
In 2004 Truvada became
FDA approved, adding to our
medical arsenal against the
virus, and having it incorpo-
rated in PEP (Post Exposure
Prophylaxis). In the case of
PEP, Truvada is administered
(now in conjunction with
raltegravir from the NHS)
after a high risk encounter
(unprotected sex with a
positive partner) or a medical
accident (accidentaly getting
stabbed with a contaminated
needle).
In recent years Truvada has
also been used on its own as
a preventative treatment for
HIV and is now commonly
used by many gay men. It
looks like one Truvada pill a
day keeps the doctor away.
Or at least reduces new
transmissions of HIV by 80
percent, according to the
2016 PROUD study. When
one in seven gay men in
London have HIV, getting the
virus becomes a statistical
inevitability. But Truvada has
really quickly made the pros-
pect of a future without HIV a
lot more concrete. For a lot of
gay men, Truvada has come
to mean hope.
Sadly it’s also becoming
a symbol of the social
inequalities that run deep in
every community, including
the gay community. In the
USA, the drug was approved
for preemptive use in 2012.
Since then, gay men and
other high risk groups can
be prescribed Truvada in the
form of PrEP (Pre Exposure
Prophylaxis). But whereas
PrEP is covered by most
health insurance plans and in
some states the drug is freely
available to those who are
diagnoses in America come
from African-Americans.
There’s another way in
which Truvada brings back
memories from the 80s, as it
reminds us of the marginali-
sation of the gay community.
In the UK, the adoption
and prescription of PrEP
was preceded by years of
campaigning and a legal
battle against the NHS. In
the meantime many gay men
looked for cheap alternatives
abroad, putting their health at
risk and conducting their own
clinical studies out of neces-
sity. Likewise in the early
years of the HIV pandemic,
the LGBT community was
forced to take matters into its
own hands. Through activism
and organised action, they
made governments pour
resources into HIV research
and even forced the FDA to
speed up and alter the drug
authorisation procedure, all
while trying new illegal drugs,
in hope of finding something,
anything, that might counter
the virus.
I talked to AJ Pittman, who
launched IWantPrepNow, an
online resource for anyone
trying to access PrEP in the
UK, and he agrees. “People
were doing this in the 80s.
It’s 35 years later and gov-
ernments and world health
Lef Apostolakis
organisations still haven’t
learned. HIV massively
disproportionately affects
marginalised communities that
are easily ignored.”
It also raises questions
about the future of safe sex.
Will PrEP cause the abandon-
ment of condom use or has
Truvada become a symbol
of empowerment? “People
on Truvada are being safe
and taking responsibility of
their health” says Pittman.
“Some people go on Truvada
because they’re already not
using condoms and some
people might use condoms a
bit less but at the end of the
day healthcare professionals
advise it’s used in conjunction
with condoms. Besides there
are many other STIs to be
worried about.”
Still, this doesn’t stop
some members of the gay
community being labelled
as ‘Truvada Whores’. When
asked about the slur Pittman
is quick to dismiss it. “No, fuck
you, I’m actually being safe”
he says cheerfully. “People
wear it proudly on their
t-shirts. Truvada Whore is a
derogatory term that we’re
reclaiming.” Maybe if the
NHS sold ‘Truvada Whore’
t-shirts it could fund PrEP.

unable to afford it, there still
remain millions of uninsured
Americans to whom the cost
of PrEP can be as high as
13,000$ a year. Similarly in
the UK, Truvada is only free
if it’s part of emergency PEP.
Getting it pre-emptively as
part of PrEP at the moment
requires shelling out £400 a
month. This can disproportion-
ately impact the unemployed,
the disadvantaged, the ethnic
minorities, the same way it
has done since the very begin-
ning of the HIV pandemic,
when by 1990, 30 percent
of reported cumulative AIDS
cases occurred in black men.
