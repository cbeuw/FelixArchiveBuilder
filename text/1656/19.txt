Saad Ahmed talks about how much choice there is in video games and how they add to the
overall experience and immersion
\\ Recent games
have more profound

game element, but enough
for you to never forget your
choice.
One complaint is that
choices don’t really matter,
especially with Telltale
Games. Whatever path you
choose, good or bad, there
are only so many possible
endings and deviations from
the story you can have. But
honestly, so what? There’s a
V
ideo games are
unique from
TV shows and
movies due to
the sense of
immersion they
give players. Having the
ability to make choices plays
a large part in this. It’s not
just any old story you get to
experience, it’s one chosen
and defined by you and that’s
what makes it all the more
intimate.
Of course, virtual
choices aren’t exactly as
open ended as you might
imagine. Considering how
many games rely on the
do. But in retrospect isn’t
real life like that as well?
We’re restricted by the con-
straints of society, the laws
of physics and what not. It’s
all for our own good but it’s
still limiting to a degree.
Some game choices are
bullshit to be fair. Like when
you confront a boss and it
asks you not to fight it but
instead rule with it. Say no
and you begin the final boss
fight, say yes and it’s game
over. But such things belong
in the past, and more recent
games have more profound
choices where there’s never
really an easy way out.
It’s accepted that there
are a number of check-
boxes a video game choice
needs to tick off to be truly
worth including. You need
to be aware of all other
choices, you shouldn’t have
the opportunity to remake
a choice, and you should
constantly be reminded of
the choice you made and
feel the repercussions from
it. The games developed
by Telltale Games are
particularly well known
for getting all these factors
right. For example, in one
part of The Walking Dead
game, you’re attacked
by zombies and have the
option of saving either one
of two characters. You can
see both of them clearly
and both of them are nice
enough that you’d rather
save them both. The game
tailors itself around your
decision, maybe not enough
to make it a substantial
limit to how much program-
mers can actually code.
And the true fun of choice
is the happiness and thrill
you get in that moment.
It’s never really about the
ending, it’s always about
the journey and how you
get there. If you really want
to go beyond what the
game will allow you, then
go play a tabletop RPG.
Often, the choices are
between generic ‘good’ and
‘bad’ choices, usually with
the added catch that the
evil choices are much more
fun. For example, if you’ve
played Star Wars: Knights
of the Old Republic, playing
on the dark side is always
much more enjoyable.
Heck, in the sequel, the
dark side’s plans actually
makes sense. A lot of other
games like Bioshock have
choices like this; do you
save the little girl or kill her
and get more powers?
These days, there’s no
right or wrong choice, just
a large mix of morally grey
ones, which honestly is a bit
like real life. There’s never
really a right or wrong
answer, you can never sat-
isfy everyone, you just have
to do what seems right to
you. This adds another layer
of complexity to gaming,
and lets you look into your-
self and see how you would
react in certain situations.
This gives gaming an edge
Left or right?
which other forms of media
don’t have. You don’t see
some person’s version of
how things are, you see
your version and how you
want things to go.
Choice, as much as it’s
programmed in, is the
defining feature of games
as a medium. By giving
players control, games
can intimately engage with
their audience and impli-
cate them in deep moral
choices or make them feel
powerless. With this level of
immersion, it’s no wonder
we keep coming back to
playing video games.

choices you make, there’s a
limit to how much you can
actually do. The first major
restriction is, of course, the
game’s programming. You
can’t do anything that the
game doesn’t allow you to
