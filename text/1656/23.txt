ShouldtheTbedroppedfromLGBT?
Elizabeth Windo goes over a brief history of the T movement and discusses the place of
transgender people within the queer community
I
t’s easy to look from
the outside at a pride
parade and see a unified
grouping of similarly
minded people. But
under this facade of
togetherness, within the LGBT
community lies a volatile
mixture of groups that
sometimes have radically
different goals. An example
of this is the recent push that
has led some, particularly
from outside the trans
community, to question the
place of the T in LGBT.
The ‘Drop the T’ ideology
originally appeared on
the website change.org. It
community.
Since then, many other
responses have also ques-
tioned the ‘different ideology’
position. While it may be true
that sexuality differs from
gender identity, the LGBT
community has historically
been linked due to shared
discrimination and oppres-
sion based on their attributes
rather than being grouped by
those attributes themselves. To
use an analogy - ‘knives are
different from forks but we
still call them cutlery’. There
is also an overlap between
the groups – it is not an
exaggeration to say that most
of the trans community would
fall under the LGB umbrella if
they were divided. If someone
was assigned female at birth,
but has always exclusively
dated men, if they come
out as trans and are treated
by society as male, society
would view that relationship
as a gay one. If they exclu-
sively dated women, it is likely
that they would have had sig-
nificant formative experiences
in the lesbian community
before transitioning fully – is
it fair or reasonable to deny
them access to that common
space simply because society
now treats them as straight?
The waters become further
muddied with non-binary
identities – what would
constitute straight in that case
anyway?
While the petition has
been met by widespread
criticism, the movement
has gained some support
from several trans people.
Supporters believe that
while the community should
remain united, campaigning
for rights should be done
separately. The motivation for
this is that campaigning that
focuses explicitly on the trans
community is more likely to
achieve meaningful progress
likely to live with a yearly
income of less than ten thou-
sand dollars per year.
The origin of this petition is
unclear, but the movement still
crops up and has been asso-
ciated with several prominent
right wing media personali-
ties, many of which are LGBT
themselves, such as Milo Yian-
nopoulis. Some trans people
have criticised this as nothing
but ‘respectability politics’,
the need to distinguish the
parts of the community that
have received some societal
acceptance with those who
are treated less well, and who
under the pretext of wanting
to help trans people on the
condition that they do not
infringe on women’s rights.
At other times, it takes a
more aggressive slant, with
many public-facing trans
people reporting significant
online harassment from this
demographic. Regardless of
the way in which it is carried
out, the ultimate goal of many
such ‘gender critical feminists’
is to exclude trans people
from LGBT and women’s
spaces, in the same fashion as
the original petition.
If there are any hard facts
to be gained from this, it is
that the LGBT community is
not monolithic. There is no
single right answer adopted
by every member, there is
no homogenised belief about
what is the correct course
of action in every situation.
Given the current political
climate however, it is the
belief of many, including the
GLAAD president, Sarah
Ellis, that it is more important
to focus on unity than refining
an existing grouping. In her
reply to the original petition,
she concluded with the follow-
ing. ‘At a time when anti-LGBT
activists continue to attack the
basic rights and protections
essential to all of our lives, we
must stand together, rather
than succumb to the ruin of
divisiveness’.

suggested that within the
LGBT community, not only
was the ‘T’ section not a
meaningful part of the whole,
but that it was fundamentally
incompatible with the L, the
G, and the B. The argument
rested on the fact that the LGB
related to sexuality, whereas
the T related to gender iden-
tity – different things entirely.
The petition itself lead
to a quick response and
dismissal from many people
including the leaders of the
Human Rights Campaign and
GLAAD, a media monitor-
ing organisation founded
by LGBT people. These two
groups were among those
explicitly listed in the peti-
tion as bodies that should

are currently more controver-
sial. While this may be the
case, it is important to also
consider the historical con-
text. The origins of the ‘drop
the T’ can be traced back a
long way, back to the days of
Greer’s radical feminism. His-
torically, radical feminism has
had a significant overlap with
the lesbian community, which
has considerable social and
academic influence. Various
radical feminist speakers have
questioned the legitimacy of
someone assigned one sex
identifying as another. At
times, this criticism is done
than one that targets the
entire umbrella. However,
organisations such as the
Human Rights Campaign
have criticised the allegations
that the focus of campaign-
ing and support is not on the
trans community where it is
appropriate. Splitting the
focus would at best change
nothing, and at worst deprive
the transgender community of
valuable platforms, numbers,
and resources. Estimates
place between 0.1% and
0.5% of the population as
part of the trans community,
many of whom may live in
poverty and are unable to
spend their time on activism.
An investigation by the
Center for American Progress
found that on average trans
and gender non-conforming
people are three times more
