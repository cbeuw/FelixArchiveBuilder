harness obviously). It was
very early in the morning and
the sea of people that occu-
pied 568 were full off chicken
wings, burgers and curly fries,
as well as American bever-
ages, all organised by the
Imperial Immortals (Imperial’s
confident lead and nine am
commitments I headed to
bed… What a plonker.
Having now watched
the second half (although
not at the Union and as
post-mortem). I can somewhat
comment on what took place.
It was Tom Brady living up
to his title of GOAT, and
the defence straight balling
on an overly complacent
Falcons’ offence. At the start
the Patriots offence seemed
to struggle, making the same
mistakes and failed drives
as the first half. The initial
change happened on the
defence, when they stopped
the Falcons’ drives consist-
ently. This was a theme for the
rest of the game. Personally,
I would say the turning point
of the game was early in the
fourth quarter when line-
backer Dont’a Hightower
flies off the edge, evading
Devonta Freeman’s feeble
attempt at a block, then to
smack Matt Ryan off his feet
and force the fumble. The
fumble was recovered by the
Patriots giving them great
field position and momentum.
It’s fair to say Matty ice was
not so cool after that.
The other play of note is
Julian Edelman’s miracle
‘shoe’ catch… After the ball
was tipped by a Falcons’
player, there was a free-
for-all which left Edelman
sandwiched between three
Falcons’ players. Juggling
the ball, Edelman with the
concentration of a monk,
managed to keep the ball
from hitting the ground even
when a rogue foot tried to
dislodge it from his grip. A
few times he seemed to let
go of the ball and it was held
there by what seemed to be
divine intervention waiting
to be plucked from the ether
(on second thought it was just
slow motion…). Edelman was
seventh round draft pick in the
2009 NFL draft. In college
he played quarterback NOT
the wide-receiver and punt
specialist he came to play as
in the NFL. Tom Brady was
even sixth round pick, and the
James White (their running
back who now holds the
record of most points scored
in a Super bowl) was an
unknown of the 4th
round pick.
The Patriots seem to build
their franchise on overlooked
players. To take the fire within
them from being downtrod-
den, and channelling it to
be great. This can’t be all
attributed to a chance or
some implicit attribute of the
franchise. One source is the
record breaking head coach
that has led the Patriots to
win five Super bowls during
his time. Bill Belichick, like
Vince Lombardi, cares only
about winning which can be
summarised by his comment
after winning one of the (in
my opinion) most memorable
Super Bowls: “As of today,
and as great as today feels
and as great as today is, in
all honesty we’re five weeks
behind in the 2017 season.”
This inexhaustible work ethic
is what gives the Patriots a
winning season year after
year.
I pains me to say it but Tom
Brady is the GOAT… The
records he set during this
Super Bowl are as follows:
Most Super Bowls played
in – 7
Most passes over his career in
Super Bowls – 309
Most passes in a Super Bowl
– 62
Most completions over his
career in Super Bowls – 207
Most completions in a Super
Bowl – 43
Most passing yards over his
career in Super Bowls – 2071
Most passing Yards in game
– 466
Most touchdown passes in a
Super Bowl – 15
He is truly the greatest of all
time; to keep his composure,
and to overcome the largest
point deficit (25 points) ever
recorded in a Super Bowl. No
wonder he was named Super
Bowl MVP. The final score was
34-28 Patriots, a defensive
shutout for the second half
by the Patriots, and overtime
touchdown sealed the game.
Perhaps the best match that
will be played in my lifetime,
and I missed it! Moral of the
story: don’t be a wettie, go to
the Union and watch one of
greatest sporting spectacles
in the world. Celebrate or
drown your sorrows, sleep is
for the weak.

S
uper bowl came
about due to a
merger agreement
between two of
the rival American
football leagues
the AFL (American Football
league) and the NFL
(National football league).
This became official in 1970
when the NFL we all know
and love was created. At
that time there were only 26
teams, the rest were added as
part of expansion programs
(there have been talks of an
UK based expansion team
with 2022 set as the target
date). The first Super bowl
was played in Los Angeles
Memorial Coliseum with the
crème de la crème of the NFL
and AFL being the Green
Bay Packers and Kansas City
Chiefs respectively. Under the
coaching of the legendary
Vince Lombardi the Green
Bay Packers won the game.
Quarterback Bart Starr was
named Super bowl MVP for
his dominant 250 yard, two
touchdown performance;
impressive in those times. The
following year the Packers
won again against the
Oakland Raiders with the
Raiders’ line-backers’ coach
being John Madden, who
has his name attributed to the
long-running Madden NFL
video game series. The more
you know…
The Super bowl trophy is
famously named the Vince
Lombardi trophy, but why?
From what I have told you
already Vince Lombardi has
only won two Super Bowls,
Bill Belichick the New Eng-
land Patriots head coach has
already won four (*spoilers*
now five). Well you see, it
isn’t all about numbers. He is
the benchmark of what it is
to be a great coach, leader
and man. Fifty years on and
the coaches of today still look
up to him. His dedication and
passion to win is unparalleled
and can be summarised in
this quote: “Winning isn’t
everything; it’s the only
thing”, he never coached
a losing season and had a
90% win rate in post-season.
Unfortunately, in 1970, at the
age of 57, he passed away
due to cancer of his colon.
With his sudden passing the
newly merged NFL decided to
name the Super bowl trophy
after the man that had given
so much to the sport. On his
deathbed he reportedly said
that he regretted having not
achieved more in his life. With
expectations of himself like
that, it is easy to understand
how he achieved so much.
A relentless, unwavering
dedication to the sport of
American football. An ideal
that all players, and coaches
must strive to achieve. The
allowed him to make some
epic plays that included some
‘toe drag swag’ that kept him
inbounds and allowed him to
catch the seemingly uncatch-
able. As well as the catches,
the threat of him alone
meant the Patriots defence
assigned more attention to
him. This allowed Taylor
Gabriel, Austin Hooper, and
Mohamed Sanu, to make
some plays. Although a lot
can be said about the aerial
assault, what I felt gave the
offence momentum was the
devastating ground and
pound run game. Predom-
inantly it was Devonta
Freeman and Tevin Coleman
in the backfield, these two
running backs are still at the
start of their careers with less
than five years in the league
between them. The Falcons’
offensive line punched holes
through the Patriots’ defensive
allowing the two running
backs to explode through
into the Patriots second level.
Jump-cutting, handing off and
trucking their way toward the
end zone, the duo instilled
fear in the Patriots defence.
It cannot be said that the
Patriots offence looked drab
and uncoordinated, with a
player like Tom Brady at the
helm it would never be so.
It was the Falcon’s Defence
that played out their skin. This
is evidenced by an 82 yard
pick six from Robert Alford,
Brady isn’t one to make
stupid mistakes and looking
at the tape again you can
appreciate how great (albeit
Once in his hands it was open
field except from a dramatic
attempt at a tackle from
Brady. When the half finally
came to a close the score was
21-3 Falcons with the only
score from the Patriots being
a 41-yard field goal.
When it got to half-time the
mood in the Union ranged
from deep melancholy to
exuberant elation. Falcons’
fans were over the moon with
the dominant first half they
had. On the other hand, the
Patriots’ fans were left with an
(almost) insurmountable score
deficient and the repugnant
smell of defeat in their nos-
trils. Faith seemed to be all
but lost, both in the game and
their famed GOAT (greatest
of all time) quarterback Tom
Brady.
To the non-dedicated and
uninterested fans the best part
of the night was just starting
at the Union: The halftime
show. Cue the lights, the
music, and Lady Gaga in the
most comical of American
football equipment flying
around NRG Stadium (in a
pinnacle of excellence, the

February 5th
of this year,
the fifty first super bowl was
played (LI for those Romans
out there), and as you proba-
bly heard, it was contested by
the Atlanta Falcons and New
England Patriots.
The first half was a very
dominant performance by the
Falcons with Matt Ryan as
quarterback (a position some-
times referred more fittingly
as Field General), delivering
a devastating aerial assault
on the Patriots defence. With
short bullet passes and long
bombs to his receivers, his
cannon of an arm obliterated
yards. A big advantage was
having Julio ‘the freak’ Jones
that seems to be genetically
engineered to play ball, he
is six foot three, 220 pounds,
with a sub-4.4 second 40

know what that means, but let
me assure you he is a beast.
Julio managed to couple his
