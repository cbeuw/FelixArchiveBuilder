T
he Kent Falcons
were our first game
this season, all the
way back on the 6th
of November. As
memory serves, we
lost that game in a narrow
overtime loss. The team have
come far since then, and
we showed it this Sunday.
The Falcons (no Super Bowl
relation) were quickly given
the ball after an unsuccessful
Imperial Immortals’ drive lead
to a score for the Falcons.
There were evidently some
nerves over the new offensive
playbook. The hollow bones
of the Falcons were then
shaken by monstrous runs by
Jason ‘Book your hospital
bed’ Patrick Kuilan who won
ONLY Offensive MVP, even
with the absolutely savage
hits on defence where he
also plays line-backer. He
scored the first touchdown
with a bone-shattering run
that unfortunately left an
injured Falcon in his wake, the
Imperial Immortals wish the
Falcon a speedy recovery.
A two-point conversion was
scored with a leaping catch
by Aaron ‘don’t knock it ‘til
you try it’ Wilson. Aaron
went on to make quite a few
catches both on offence,
defence and Metric (one
catch was the touchdown
that won us the game), so his
plays made him deserving of
the honour of overall MVP.
This was a joint award given
to Lukas ‘40 yard crawl’
Hanns for his plays on both
offence and defence that
included an excellently-
executed reverse play that
had him strolling toward the
end zone. Unfortunately he
was hit out of bounds within
ten yards but a short pass
gave Aaron the touchdown.
Defence was as stellar as
always with Teddy Tal-e-on-
ping-pong (Defensive MVP)
leading them to an almost
perfect game. A new face on
defence was Dan ‘not in my
swamp’ Grumberg (Line MVP)
who ate up the Falcons’ runs
all day. Special teams can
be personified by one play
of Markus ‘My pres’ Mohr
(Special team MVP), when he
bulldozed the unsuspecting
kick returner leaving the
Falcon spread-eagled (pun
fully-intended) on the floor
looking up to Markus who
was standing above him with
a pose that clearly stated:
“Don’t step to me, fam”.
It ain’t pretty, this home of
ours. It could even be the long
lost third Heathrow runway,
but one thing is for sure, it’s
ours; our home. Currently the

A
man with a
Scouse accent,
unfortunate
bowels and
admittedly
good tackling
technique once said: ‘Imperial
have never won a game
without me’. The record
remained standing as IC 1s
dominated the set-piece to
win a comfortable away
victory against Surrey. Man
of the Match Tom ‘Shuz’
Szyszko put in an admirable
shift as the forward pack
won themselves a penalty
try after numerous scrums on
the opposition five metre line.
Strong defence around the
ruck kept Surrey’s attack to
a minimum, although some
slow folding caught IC off
guard out wide a few times.
However, excellent scramble
defence kept Surrey just short
of the line and IC were soon
back on the front foot, and a
late first half penalty helped
Imperial lead 10-0 at the
break. A strong start to the
second half put IC back in
Surrey’s 22, and Shuz soon
surprised all with a burst
of speed and dexterity to
batter down the defence and
score a textbook reaching-
try. Charles Price-Smith,
spurred on by a female friend
supporting on the touchline,
slotted the conversion from
out wide. Another try was
scored out wide to bring the
score to 22-0. IC pushed for
the bonus point, but Charles
wanted to catch up with his
friend on the sideline and
promptly got himself a yellow
card. With Imperial’s defence
stretched and some rushed
exits, Surrey came back to
score two tries before the
impending whistle. Final score
22-12. Congrats to Shuz for a
stand-out return, and to DNS
for a quality defensive game.
Immortals are UNDEFEATED
at #FortHarlington, and we
will look to stay that way
going into our game next
week, against top-of-the-
league Cambridge Pythons,
who we lost narrowly against
last week. We are looking for
players and chain crew; the
latter will pay the handsome
sum of £10 to come along,
watch the game and support
the referees (and Immortals).
