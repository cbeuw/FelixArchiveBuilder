We should
welcome
Trump
Shaul Rosten explains why banning
Trump from the UK would be
counterproductive and hypotricical
T
wo weeks ago,
n e w l y - e l e c t e d
President of the
United States,
Donald Trump,
signed an
Executive order suspending
entry to the United States for
residents of seven Muslim-
majority countries, and for
Syrian refugees. This was
a key campaign pledge,
and, although more crudely
proposed as a total ban on
all Muslims, he was largely
ignored at the time as an
egotistical idiot who had
shouted his way into the
Republican candidacy, and
whose opinions would have
little actual impact on US
foreign policy. Now that he
is in power, a much greater
global response to the policy
has formed, propelling,
almost symbolically, the cause
of inclusion against division.
At the time of writing, 1.3
million people have signed a
petition urging this government
to either postpone or cancel
the State visit of Donald
Trump, as the US President,
to the UK. Many prominent
(although inexplicably so)
politicians have endorsed this
call. Jeremy Corbyn stated
that "Donald Trump should not
be welcomed to Britain while
he abuses our shared values
with his shameful Muslim ban
and attacks on refugees' and
women's rights"
I find this rhetoric, from
citizen and politician alike,
an insidious example of
raging liberal hypocrisy to
a degree it has hardly yet
\\ Ignoring problems and
people does not make them
go away \\
seen. I have no problem with
protesting a policy with which
you do not agree, either at
home or abroad. However,
requesting disengagement
entirely is an eminently stupid
suggestion – we do not have
a policy of ignoring people
with whom we disagree, but
engaging with them, raising
our concerns and creating
an open dialogue so as to
build stronger relationships
with them. This was evident
amongst the liberal camp in
the recent US election. Shia
LaBoeuf, the famous actor,
started a campaign called 'He
Will Not Divide Us'. People
advocated unity, talking to
people from different faiths
and communities to strengthen
ties and unify ambitions.
Suddenly, however, when
the people with different
views are people without
liberal views, the left-wing
clamours for a total boycott of
relationship, communication
and engagement. This flies
in the face of the 'values'
so strongly and sternly
proclaimed in recent years,
and, by anyone's estimation, is
obviously not the way forward
to incubating global inclusivity
and freedom. What surprises
and upsets me most, however,
is the sheer hypocrisy of
spearhead figures on the UK
left: Jeremy Corbyn shared
a platform with the terrorist
organisation Hezbollah,
clearly a divisive group whose
values do not reflect those of
the UK. But how did Mr Corbyn
defend his actions? He called
for engagement and open
conversation with those with
whom we disagree, saying
that he was “encouraging
them to have a discussion”. In
fact, the following is a direct
quote from his spokesperson,
speaking about his support
for Hamas and Hezbollah,
both internationally
recognised terrorist, extremist
organisations:
“[Corbyn] has met many
people with whom he
profoundly disagrees in
order to promote peace and
reconciliation processes,
including in South Africa,
Latin American, Ireland and
the Middle East. He believes
it is essential to speak to
people with whom there is
disagreement, particularly
when they have large-scale
support or democratic
mandates. Simply talking to
people who agree with you
won’t help achieve justice or
peace.”
Interesting.
Sadiq Khan, Mayor of
London, oddly a labour
politician whom I'm somewhat
supportive of, also joined the
cry for a Trump ban, but he
too has stood shoulder to
shoulder with groups and
individuals whose views make
Trump look like a big orange
Mother Teresa. At one such
event, he shared a platform
with a Hamas supporter, and
a preacher who backs Islamic

State. There are few whose
values could be further from
the British ideal. What was his
defence? Again, he stressed
the importance of the fact
that he “engaged regularly”
with those with whom he might
disagree. Interesting indeed.
Putting these individuals
aside, I am equally
disappointed by the
hypocritical attitude of the
1.3 million UK signatories.
Engagement with other views
and opinions is what your
hatred of Trump is based on
– following suit makes you,
by your own estimations, as
bad as him. As well as this,
UK foreign policy is built on
cross communication. We
have open communication
with Saudi Arabia, where
women are banned from
driving, Iran, Zimbabwe and
Russia, amongst others. It
is not a complex lesson to
learn: ignoring problems and
people does not make them
go away, and discussion
and engagement are the
cornerstones of cooperation
and inclusivity. The United
Nations is emblematic of this,
standing as a centre point for
all nations to pool opinions,
resources, and backgrounds,
in a combined effort to make
the world a better place.
Irrespective of your views
on Donald Trump and his
immigration policy, in any
situation, principles are what
you act by. If you truly believe
in bringing together people of
different faiths, backgrounds,
ethnicities and – most
fundamentally – opinions,
then there are no grounds
for a call for disengagement.
Wake up.
Coming out
was an attempt
to find myself
Lucille Calmon discusses labels, coming
out and falling in love
I
wasaspecialkid(thelonely
and isolated type, always
lost in their thoughts).
Around the age of five,
I remember first hearing
about homosexuality
and even though it was not
quite described as a ‘bad
thing’, I still associated it with
something to be afraid of.
I told myself “with my luck,
it will happen to me too”
while thinking about a family
member who was actually gay.
Growing up, I became
obsessed with boys. Though
I kept falling for random
guys, I seemed unable to get
a boyfriend. And there was
always that little thought that
kept popping up, convincing
me that eventually something
wouldhappenandmydormant
sexuality would wake up.
When bored, I’d do these
thought experiments ‘for
\\ The truth is that there is no
accurate label to describe
me, or anyone \\
fun’. I wondered how it
might feel to be with a
girl. When crushes started
returning my attention, I’d
realise, as terrifying as it
felt (I was 15), that I was
no longer interested in
them. Not one bit. Still, just
to make sure, I kissed my
first boyfriend. I freaked
out realising something
was wrong, unable to put
my finger on it. I declared
myself ‘confused’, lacking a
more accurate – or perhaps
self-aware – label. I kept
falling in love, careful to
choose men as unavailable
as possible to avoid tragic
disillusions.
What followed were two
years of total confusion
and constant flip-flopping.
I would spend a few weeks
convinced I was gay,
embrace my identity, feel
internally proud, and lose
any and all interest in
guys (in secret of course).
Then one morning, I would
wake up feeling straight,
convinced I “hadn’t met the
right guy yet”. This would
last for a few weeks and I
would eventually go back
to being a ‘full-on lesbian’.
In a state of total confusion,
and too early (in hindsight)
I started coming out, craving
a label.
The main reason for this, I
now think, must have been
the lack of community: not
knowing any gay girls in
high school and being too
young to gather the courage
to go out and meet any.
I originally came out as
bisexual, diplomatically,
thinking it would be a solution
to my feelings of confusion.
Sadly, my coming out was
not accepted by my friends
and peers, who, invoking my
feminine looks, rejected it.
At the age of 18, I was peer
pressured into seeing a guy.
We dated for a few months
but it just wasn’t working. It
was just wrong. It felt like
I had to prove a point by
dating him but at the same
time I was convinced that
being with a girl was what
I really wanted. After this
second round of disillusion-
ment (and even though I
really liked him as a person),
I came out again. Those first
few years left a bitter after-
taste. I was gay. But I had
only dated guys, had no
lesbian friends or lesbian
experience. I was a ‘straight
lesbian’. My appearance
and my past somehow made
my coming out illegitimate.
Leaving home for San
Francisco was the turning
point. Free at last from social
pressures, I met the cutest
human I had ever met. In a
moment of courage, I asked
if they were gay. And they
were. We fell in love and I
brought them home to Paris
where we moved in together.
They introduced me to their
San Francisco queer circle
(a community that seemed
deliberately hidden from me
before). I came out naturally
without formal announce-
ments. I was happy.
When I moved to London, I
realised that my identity was
respected. I naturally talked
about my partner without
hiding their gender.
The thing about coming
out (though I’m aware it
depends greatly on social
background/ family situa-
tion) is that it was only a ‘big
thing’ when I was making it
one. The first awkward com-
ing-outs to my then-peers
were in fact coming-outs to
myself. I was publicly shout-
ing “I am queer” in an effort
to make the claim real.
Struggling to define myself
using a pre-made identity, I
got to think a lot about labels.
The truth is that they’re great
safety nets. Society decides
what is expected of a person
based on their identity and
following this social to-do
plan makes life so much
easier. But retrospectively,
coming out was really about
finding myself, and sticking
to a label only gave me a
rough sketch to start with.
I won’t deny that I still feel
attracted to people of the
opposite gender and I do
wonder what kind of label
that attaches to me; weird
lesbian, bisexual, pansex-
ual, or just confused? The
truth is that there is no accu-
rate label to describe me, or
anyone.
I realised that my final
coming out was never about
sticking a visible ‘Lesbian’
sticker on my forehead but
a ‘Lucille’ one. It was about
embracing who I am as a
person, and now that I’m at
peace with myself, I don’t
need to come out again.
