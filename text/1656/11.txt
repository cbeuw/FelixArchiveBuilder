f there is a theme of
the nominees for the
BAFTAs for Best British
Short Film and Best
British Short Animation,
it would probably be
‘journey’. Across the eight
shorts, we are catapulted
from one corner of the globe
to the next, dealing with
culture. Zheng’s animation is
beautiful and haunting, filled
with exquisite images: agricul-
tural workers swishing scythes
through fields of wheat;
children running through
Chinese characters; Zheng
herself folding paper cranes
at a kitchen table. The result is
a small masterpiece, which is
moving in its simplicity.
The other two nominees
in the Best Animation cate-
gory have a more complex
animation style, but lack
the emotional nuance of
Tough. In A Love Story,
directed by Anushka Kishani
Naanayakkara, two strange
woollen creatures build up a
relationship through lengths
of coloured string, which
bind them together. Over a
soundtrack of ambient sounds
and plucking thumb pianos,
the two woollen heads float
through a disconcerting
world of fluff, with slightly
menacing, almost Lynchian
undertones. Jack Clinch’s
The Alan Dimension, mean-
while, brings things back
to reality with a charming
tale about a suburban man
who can predict the future,
only everything he predicts
is completely banal. Alan’s
obsession with this foresight
threatens to break him apart
from his wife, but – of course
– everything turns out alright
in the end. The animation
here consists of cartoon
animation against a backdrop
of model interiors, and the
overall effect is really quite
off-putting, detracting from
the film’s plot.

The shortlist of BAFTA nominees
for Best British Short Film and
Animation are daring in their
scope, but the quality of some
leaves a little to be desired
the weakest short of the selec-
tion, and its storyline is trite.
Mouth of Hell attempts to
undertake a complete narra-
tive within under 15 minutes,
which is – evidently – easy
to do badly. It’s a problem
that runs through most of the
nominees, with only Standby
managing to balance things
well.
This difficulty with narrative
is perhaps the reason why
the best nominee for British
Short Film is a documentary
rather than a piece of fiction.
Richard John Seymour’s Con-
sumed takes us on a journey
through the modern means
of production, taking us on a
near-wordless tour of China’s
manufacturing industry. Start-
ing with shots of landscapes
and mines, Seymour shows
us the vast environmental
destruction caused by human
greed, before exploring fac-
tories which produce goods
for Western countries. A
worker tells us that October is
the busiest time at the factory
because of the Western holi-
days, foreshadowing the fact
that the consumables being
produced, rather than the
traditional images of comput-
ers or iPhones, are actually
novelty Christmas items, that
will probably be thrown away
before the year is out. Com-
parable with Zhao Liang’s
Behemoth and Jia Zhangke’s
A Touch of Sin, Consumed
powerfully questions the
impact consumption is having
on the planet, both in envi-
ronmental and human terms.
Delicate, austere framing is
juxtaposed against the sheer
horror of what we are being
shown, in a manner reminis-
cent of the photographs of
Sabastião Salgado.
Jennifer Zheng’s Tough also
centres around China, but in
her animation it is China as fil-
tered through the experience
of her mother, who grew up
during the Cultural Revolu-
tion, and Zheng herself, who
was born in Britain. Drawing
on the misunderstandings and
miscommunications that have
inevitably developed as a
result of the two women expe-
riencing the world through
two different mind-sets and
languages, Tough explores
issues of race, identity, and
Jennifer Zheng’s Tough is a moving portrait of fami-
ly \\ Jennifer Zheng
British short
films take us
around the
globe
themes both big and small.
One of the most engaging
films, however, deals with
the instantly-recognisable
institution of the British police
force: Charlotte Regan’s
Standby takes place entirely
in a police car, with all shots
taken from the same angle.
Andrew Paul and Alexa
Morden play the officers,
and we join them on a
whistle-stop tour of birthdays,
breakdowns, and promotions,
punctuated by hilarious
sequences of the two cops
rapping along to Skepta.
It’s not the most profound
of pieces, but it’s lively and
amusing.
The Party, on the other
hand, deals with darker mat-
ters. From the initial title card
telling us it’s set in Belfast at
the height of the troubles, we
know that something bad is
soon going to happen. And
indeed, it soon does: a group
of adolescents celebrate in
a small house, and a fugitive
who plans on sneaking over
the border has managed to
sneak into the party to see his
friends, unknowingly placing
them all in great danger. With
its heavy patina of 1970s
tones, and shocking violence,
The Party is a commitment to
British realism.
Home, from director
Daniel Mulloy, is probably
the most-publicised film of
the nominees. Released on
World Refugee Day, Home
shows a British family making
a perilous journey from
their comfortable home life
to a war-zone, in a form of
reverse migration. Initially,
the short resembles an
advertisement for Renault,
but things shortly take a
turn for the worse. Mulloy is
good at initially building up
a sense of unease, but this
doesn’t continue until the end,
and once the audience has
grasped the concept of the
short, it doesn’t seem to have
much impact: it’s unclear how
the short is supposed to make
us any more sympathetic with
those fleeing across Europe,
especially compared to the
harrowing real-life footage
that has been present on
the news for the last twelve
months.
Samir Mehanovic’s Mouth
of Hell similarly tries to evoke
the viewer’s sympathy, telling
the story of a boy with a sick
mother who is growing up in
Jharia, India, on the surface
of a giant underground
coal seam fire. Mouth of
Hell, which mines (pun not
intended) the stereotypical
image of Indian poverty, is
