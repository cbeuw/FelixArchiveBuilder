You're
misrepresenting
the facts
Saul Coleman doesn't think the Israeli
ambassador's talk was covered
appropriately
O
pening last
week’s issue
of felix, I
was greeted
on page
three by
an article entitled “Israeli
ambassador’s secret visit to
Imperial”. And I’m pleased
to say that, on the whole, the
article was a very balanced
read, just as the event was
very civil. The sensitive nature
of the discussion had clearly
been recognised by felix,
and was therefore covered
appropriately.
Sadly, however, on closer
inspection, it became clear
that the article was riddled
with misrepresentations of the
reality of the situation. I was
left feeling that journalistic
integrity had been sacrificed
for the sake of attention-
grabbing quotes.
To begin with, the extracts
chosen for emphasis in the
article did a disservice not
\\ Implying mutual
responsibility for the
protests-turned-violent-
mobs that did indeed occur
is unfair and untrue \\
only to the truth, but also to
the content of the article. The
first extract, “the ambassador
likely visited Imperial as part
of Israel’s wider anti-BDS
(Boycott, Divestment and
Sanctions) strategy,” is more
than a bit strange. Would the
author expect other countries’
ambassadors not to oppose
campaigns to boycott the
countries they represent?
The other extract poses an
even greater issue. “It is quite
worrying that the College did
not think to invite an opposing
view to help balance the
conversation themselves. This
would’ve lead to a much more
open-minded and fruitful
discussion.”
This direct quote from
the representative of
the Palestinian Society
is, categorically, a lie. I
personally have two forms
of written proof that the
Palestinian Society was
contacted, by Dr Wraith as
well as the Israeli Society,
during the early stages of
planning the event as far back
as October. Furthermore, the
fact that the quote was false
should not be used to mislead
readers – intentionally or
otherwise.
Moreover, both the
Ambassador and Dr
Wraith said very clearly
during the visit that the
Palestinian counterpart to
the Israeli Ambassador,
Manuel Hassassian, would
be welcome to speak at
Imperial. As this talk was
predominantly the initiative
of the Israeli Embassy,
this criticism of the event
organisers would instead be
better directed at Manuel
Hassassian, who would have
been more than able to take
the same initiative.
Moving on to the rest of the
quote in the bulk of article:
“…Further still, the fact that
the event was not publicised
properly… is, in itself,
disheartening.”Publicityofthe
event was a matter of security
following recommendations
by the police. I do not see
any reason that the limited
publicity would have caused
bias or swayed attendance –
neither the Israeli Society nor
the Jewish Society publicly
advertised it, yet the event
was sold out.
It would be heartening if
such security measures were
not necessary, but as the
article helpfully pointed out,
the police were anxious to
avoid a repeat of last year’s
events at King’s College and
UCL.
But to say that “protestors on
both sides clashed at events
with pro-Israel speakers” is
misleading. Implying mutual
responsibility for the protests-
turned-violent-mobs that did
indeed occur is unfair and
untrue. The violence and
intimidation at these ‘clashes’
was instigated entirely by
protesters attempting to shut
down free speech – it takes
only a cursory glance at the
ample smartphone footage to
verify this. On both occasions,
a police escort was required
to enable attendees to leave
the location of the talk.
My attention was also drawn
to two points in the article
where the Ambassador’s
arguments were unfairly cut
short. The first relates to the
section of the article about
mutual recognition and the
Peel Partition. Despite my
utmost respect for Dr Wraith,
the assumption that his
rebuttal was the final word on
the matter is misleading. The
Ambassador never claimed
that the Zionist Commission
accepted the Peel Partition
plan, as Dr Wraith’s comment
implies. He said that the
Israelis accepted the principle
of partition, while the Arabs
did not. The important fact
that the article leaves out is
that the Zionist Commission
empowered its executive to
negotiate more favourable
borders, but did not outright
rejecttheprincipleofpartition.
The Palestinian Arab reaction,
however, was to reject the
principle in its entirety.
The other point relates to
the Ambassador’s view of the
UN: “Everyone agrees at the
UN it’s always Israel’s fault.”
Ending the discussion there
disregards what he later went
on to point out: “everyone”
includes the two previous UN
Secretary-Generals, Ban Ki-
moon and Kofi Annan, the
former saying that “Decades
of political maneuvering have
created a disproportionate
number of resolutions, reports
and committees against
Israel.”
With all this being said, I
thank felix for covering such
an important topic, and for
doing so far more fairly than
is often the case. We should
be proud that such difficult,
yet important discussion can
take place so respectfully
at Imperial. I look forward
to hearing from Manuel
Hassassian, and hope that
constructive dialogue can
continue in such a productive
and respectful manner.

The NHS has no
idea what it's doing
when it comes to
trans patients
An anonymous writer discusses the
NHS's complete failure to address the
needs of transgender patients
O
ne of the most
disconcerting
t h i n g s
you can
experience
when visiting
the doctor is seeing your GP
open up Internet Explorer and
start googling. As a nervous
transgender teenager, I was
completely terrified. GPs
are meant to be a first point
of contact for the general
population; somebody we
turn to for answers, not more
questions. But for transgender
people, a lack of knowledge
by doctors is to be expected.
However, a few minutes
and a few searches later (no
doubt more training on trans
issues than she had received in
her entire career) my GP felt
enough of an authority on the
subject to recommend a swift
and decisive course of action.
That action? Absolutely
nothing; according to a
cursory browse of the internet,
as well as a couple of pages
from a book, she determined
that the NHS could not treat
me until I was eighteen years
old. Many trans people have
such problems getting a
referral to a Gender Identity
Clinic (GIC).
\\ For transgender people,
a lack of knowledge is to be
expected \\
Although the NHS does
in fact accept transgender
patients of all ages, I didn't
know this – I had no idea
that much of what I had been
told was completely false. I
returned to the GP one year
later to claim my golden ticket:
a referral to the Charing Cross
Gender Identity Clinic. Frankly
speaking, I was mentally very
unwell but still optimistic for
the future.
However, things were not
going to be that simple. The
time from referral to first
appointment at the Charing
Cross GIC is currently
estimated at twelve months
– I personally had to wait
closer to 18 months. To make
matters worse, the length of
time people spend on waiting
lists is increasing. Patients
at Charing Cross are being
discharged at roughly half the
rate they are being received.
Clinics in places like Leeds
have estimated waiting times
of up to four years. Either
way, it is a far cry indeed from
the imposed legal limit of 18
weeks.
Approximately two and
a half years after the first
time I visited the GP, with
extremely poor mental health,
I’m able to attend my initial
appointment at the GIC. The
clinic itself, having acquired
a slightly magical quality
in my imagination over the
years, struck me as bland
and inconspicuous. Although
located above a Sainsbury’s
outside the official bounds
of the hospital, it serves the
entirety of London as well
as approximately half of
England. A waiting list of over
a thousand people, and I had
finally made it!
Having now registered
at a certain nearby health
centre, more roadblocks for
my gender transition readily
appeared. The failure of my
GP to monitor the levels of
sex hormones in my blood for
six months, until I personally
intervened, was one of them.
Not only is such casual
negligence a problem for
transgender people, but some
GPs may outright refuse to
prescribe some medication
required by a Gender Identity
Clinic, claiming that it is too
expensive.
Although problems like
these are no doubt intolerable
for cisgender patients, it
has become the norm for
transgender people. In
particular, there is the need to
essentially infantilise your GP,
\\ I had no idea
that much of what I
had been told was
completely false\\
\\ For a
demographic with
an attempted suicide
rate of almost 40%,
the NHS displays
little urgency when
treating transgender
patients \\
as you have to assume they
have zero knowledge in trans
healthcare. You have to find
out from other trans people
on the internet (nobody else
is available to help you) and
tell your GP the best way to
treat you, because they will
not know.
I find myself looking at the
fourth anniversary of that
first visit to the GP in the
summer later this year. With
my dosage being increased
and my blood levels being
monitored properly, hopefully
I will be on the correct dosage
of hormones by the time that
day comes.
For a demographic with
an attempted suicide rate of
almost 40%, the NHS displays
little urgency when treating
transgender patients. I have
had immense difficulty trying
to cope with the NHS system
and it has become the defining
struggle of the first twenty
years of my life.
Therearepeoplewhowillnot
get through the system alive,
or commit suicide shortly into
hormone therapy. A former
tutee of my father was one
such person. I do not know
his name, as he was referred
to only as “the woman who
thought she was a man” in
conversation, but perhaps
we should take a moment to
remember him when we talk
about transgender healthcare.
