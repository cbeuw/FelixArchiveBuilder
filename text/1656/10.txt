Toni Erdmann, a Ger-
man-Austrian film by Maren
Ade has seen no end to
the praise received from
critics worldwide since it’s
screenings along the festival
circuit in 2016. It features in
the top film lists of countless
film magazines including
being named the Best Film
of 2016 by Sight&Sound
and Cahiers du Cinéma and
is also one of the favoured
picks for the 2017 Academy
Awards for Best Foreign Pic-
ture. Given all this acclaim,
and as such it is always
also a product of pain”,
and Winfred uses this as his
‘weapon’ to reconnect with
Ines. The film then follows
this interplay between the
two, Winfred inventing new
pranks and Ines respond-
ing to them and raising the
ante. It weaves through
moments of pure hilarity
and stillness as Winfred
tries to soften his daughter’s
rigid life, restore their rela-
tionship and to remind her
to allow time to breathe.
The contrast between the
life of Winfred and of
Ines is also highlighted
significantly throughout the
film. Winfred is shown to
be concerned with the life
Ines has chosen, the tightly
filled schedules and her
apparent loss of humanity.
Ines on the other hand con-
siders her father as weak
and naive for having these
inhibitions. Throughout the
film the two are seen to
battle each other to find a
middle ground for both their
outlooks on life, amidst all
conveys this mental progres-
sion of Ines exceptionally
well. There is no doubt that
the two leads carry this film
and make it the masterpiece
it is and this was recognised
by them both winning Best
Actor and Actress for their
roles at the European Film
Awards 2016.
Toni Erdmann, despite
being nearly three hours
long, is a gem of a film.
It’s a comedy, with thought
and tenderness and is one
to watch. And if you’re put
off by the subtitles, you
can wait for the recently
announced remake with
Jack Nicholson and Kristen
Wigg. But we all know how
those turn out.

Sight&Sound’s Best Film of 2016, Toni
Erdmann follows the attempts of a
father attempting to reconnect with
his estranged daugher, with a perfect
mixture of hilarity and sincerity
the chaos.
Toni Erdmann, despite
its title, evolves into a film
just as much about Ines
as it is about Toni. Ines is
portrayed to be an intelli-
gent, strong-willed woman,
who has risen above the
challenge of her seem-
ingly 24 hour corporate
lifestyle, which involves
having to constantly please
her boss, her clients and
apparently their wives. She
is a machine, balancing all
these tasks seamlessly and
being constantly under-
mined, an issue observed
by most women in the
male-dominated business
world. However, Ines is
shown to be, or at least
shown to pretend to be,
oblivious to this issue of
sexism and on questioned
on whether she was a
feminist, even states “I am

ERDMANN
it’s hard to imagine that
such a film is not the talk of
the town during its release
given the astounding hype
procured by other singing
and dancing counterparts.
Toni Erdmann follows
the hilarious yet touch-
ing attempts of a father,
Winfred Conradi (Peter
Simonischek), to reconnect
with his estranged daugh-
ter Ines Conradi (Sandra
Hüller). Winfred, a divorced
music teacher is shown to
live a quiet life that consists
of a steady dose of silly
pranks played on anyone
and everyone. But after
his last student drops out
and his dog dies, Winfred
decides to take his pranks
to his daughter in Bucharest
hoping to rekindle their
relationship, much to the
dismay of Ines.
After the initial visit suc-
ceeded in nothing except
disrupting Ines’s busy corpo-
rate life as a management
consultant, Winfred leaves
Ines only to re-infiltrate her
life as Toni Erdmann, the
life coach of Ines’s boss.
Ines, rising to the chal-
lenge allows him to play
out his prank. Director Ade
explained “Humour is often
a way of coping with things,
not a feminist or I wouldn’t
tolerate guys like you”. She
considers herself an equal
and acts that way, which
leads her to seem cold and
unapproachable, having
to constantly fight against
these pressures and empha-
sise her presence. This
pressure undoubtedly takes
its toll and the added com-
plication of having to deal
with her father’s presence
results in her losing control
of her perfectly manicured
life leading to several phe-
nomenal scenes including
an amazing rendition of
The Greatest Love of All by
Whitney Houston and lead-
ing up to the confusing yet
absolutely brilliant birthday
brunch scene.
For a film whose humour is
implied through the inability
of Winfred to act as Toni,
this puts Peter Simonischek,
incredible as he is, in a
tough situation. However,
as the film’s accolades have
shown, it was to great suc-
cess. Simonischek was able
to capture the awkwardness
of the whole situation, whilst
not making it completely
so, allowing for moments of
calm and sincerity. Sandra
Hüller too embodied the
career driven Ines perfectly.
One could think of the
entire film as a journey of
self-realisation for Ines,
aided by Toni. And Hüller
