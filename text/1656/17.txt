Criminally
short | The
Benefits of
Gusbandry
Anurag Deshpande
First debuting as a web-series
in late 2015, The Benefits of
Gusbandry has only recently
joined the Amazon Prime
arsenal. As a series trying to
portray a different side of the
relationships between man
and woman, how does it stack
up?
B
uilt from the ground
up by creator Alicia
J. Rose, this series
of ten-ish minute
shorts chronicles
the ever-evolving
relationship between
40-something Oregonite
Jackie, and her so-called
‘gay husband’, River. Now,
to the uninitiated (as I was)
this may conjure up images
of cringe-worthy sitcom
shenanigans. Rather, what we
get is an often genuine and
frequently heartfelt attempt
at eschewing the traditional
relationship paradigms one
finds on TV.
Certainly, it is tempting to
draw comparisons between
Benefits and the seminal 90s
sitcom, Will & Grace. While
there are certainly echoes of
the central protagonists of
that series to be found here,
Gusbandry strives to go one
step further by aiming for
greater authenticity in its por-
trayals of its gay characters,
and by trying to stray away
from some of the stereotypes
shows like Will & Grace
sometimes slipped into. On
this front, it hits more than it
misses.
“Men crave women in their
life, and women crave men
in their life, but it doesn’t
have to be in a heteronor-
mative way. Relationships
that are founded and thrive
on alliance, acceptance and
love – that’s really important”
says Rose in an interview with
Out Magazine, distilling the
mission statement of the show
into one sentence. Interest-
ingly, this is Rose’s first major
such project. Having previ-
ously worked on music videos
and as a photographer, Rose
claims to have based facets
of the show on her own
experiences. River himself is
said to be modelled after her
long-time friend and LGBT
activist Lake Perriguey; who
also happens to be Oregon’s
first non-binary individual. As
such, Rose has made clear
that it was always very impor-
tant for her to have an actual
gay man playing River.
The series itself starts out at
Jackie’s 40th
birthday party,
quickly setting up her char-
acter. She’s jaded, witty, and
with a trail of bad relation-
ships behind her; in short, a
typically trope heavy sitcom
protagonist. It’s here she
meets River, initially not real-
ising he’s gay and developing
a crush on him. Thankfully,
this misunderstanding is
rapidly cleared up, and what
follows is a series of snap-
shots of different stages of
their friendship.
Brooke Totman does an
amicable job as Jackie,
especially considering that
not all her material is stellar.
The real star of the show,
however, is Kurt Conroyd as
River. He effuses charm, and
the chemistry between him
and Totman drives the show.
It makes the more heartfelt
moments of the series feel all
the more genuine.
In tone, The Benefits of
Gusbandry is not at all osten-
tatious, instead opting for
a more down-to-earth vibe.
This certainly helps it feel
realistic, although sometimes
gratingly so. In addition,
while the humour is generally
good, jokes do fall flat a
not-insignificant proportion
of the time. Most of these are
concentrated towards
the beginning of
the series,
however,
as the
show
has

some teething troubles. The
aforementioned character
interactions are likeable
enough, however, that the
series managed to hold my
interest despite these hurdles.
Frustratingly, however, the
show fumbles slightly in its
final episode. Not only does it
opt for a cliff-hanger ending,
which wouldn’t be so bad on
its own, but it also annoyingly
opts for a classic ‘misunder-
standing’ plot. This agonises

the viewer and just makes it
feel like a waste of time.
While The Benefits of
Gusbandry certainly mixes
things up, and strives to show
the under-represented sides
of the gay community, it still
keeps a somewhat limited
perspective; falling into the
majority of white male gay
characters found in TV.
All things considered, The
Benefits of Gusbandry is
a great show, especially
making concessions for its
length, and the fact that this
is creator Alicia Rose’s first
major project. While the
comedy isn’t always perfect,
it strives to be, and its efforts
to broaden the views of the
gay community typically
found on TV must be
appreciated.
