EndingtheCycleofJunk
A
s I type, I’m
eating a
thin slice of
Japanese
soufflé
cheesecake
I made yesterday. But the
pleasure I took in eating
it triggered a glitch of
annoyance. I realised such
fine nuances of taste and
texture are easily overlooked
in today’s world where
easy access to and high
abundance of high-energy,
palatable, chemical-laden
foods is the norm. These are
the reasons that drive the
overwhelming prevalence
of obesity and metabolic
disease.
A study published just two
months ago in Frontiers in
Behavioral Neuroscience
showed that it’s just as easy to
pull oneself out of debilitating
junk food habits as it is to get
stuck in it, by examining the
effect of food-paired environ-
mental cues on food-seeking
behavior. With so much
eating done outside of the
house, we are constantly
bombarded with external
stimuli to promote the pur-
chase and consumption of
foods high in energy but low
in micronutrients.
The two experiments
reported in this particular
experiment each began with
conditioning: non-deprived
rats received repeated expo-
sure to standard lab nosh,
and another paired with
highly palatable junk foods
such as Oreos, Pringles and
jelly snakes. A third set of rats
were food-deprived for instru-
mental training, where rats
could press levers to obtain
sugary water or pellets in
order to test the effect of envi-
ronment on food consumption
being either based on deci-
sions or habitual. Perhaps not
surprisingly, experiment one
found that the rats on junk
food promoted habitual con-
trol over behavior, compared
to a bland food context. The
second experiment is what
makes this experiment novel,
attempting to reverse this
habitual effect, this mindless
snatching of M&M’s and
“oh look they’re all gone in
ten” attitude, by exploring
whether the presentation of a
discrete cue paired with food
and its environment would
restore control over behavior
when faced with junk food.
In the second experiment,
the rats underwent the same
procedures as in the first
experiment. However, this
time, distinct sound cues were
played whenever rats were
placed in either junk-food or
bland chow contexts, creating
specific environmental cues
associated with the differing
food types. The researchers
found that the cue played
in the bland chow context
improved sensitivity to the
devaluation of food, when
rats were then presented with
an abundance to junk food
after having been fed. So
there you go: A sound cue
paired with bland food is all
it took to take rats out of a
habitual mode of behavior
and back into a mind frame
of better self-control. Of
course, rats aren’t all the
same physiologically or men-
tally as us humans, but this
still provides some insight into
our relationship with food,
proving we can control our-
selves than we think. Another
slice of insight derived from
these experiments: our natu-
ral inclination towards fatty or
sweet foods are mostly envi-
ronment-driven, not because
our bodies are in dire need
24/7 of all that high fructose
corn syrup. We can’t always
use the excuse that our ances-
tors, who were much more
F
act: Goats spin
spider-webs.
OK, slight embel-
lishment. Science
can make goats that
produce spider silk in
their milk.
Obviously having a few
goats minding their own
business is better than having
millions of spiders in a farm
all viciously tearing each
other’s heads off – which
is exactly what happened
during the initial efforts to
mass-produce spider silk,
since apparently spiders are
highly territorial and don’t
play well with others. But how
to go about it?
Using a process known as
genetic modification, or splic-
ing, DNA from spiders can
be artificially added to the
DNA of goats – in particular.
Scientists have transferred
the genes required to spin silk
into our unsuspecting furry
friends to allow mass-produc-
tion of an incredibly powerful
material. The elegant part is
that the gene is inserted in
such a way that it is only acti-
vated during milk production
– so the silk is only made in
milk, not in any other part of
the goat where it might cause
disease.
Those who despise all things
spider might wonder why
you’d bother making massive
quantities of cobwebs? Turns
out spider silk is actually a
‘supermaterial’ – use it to
make ‘Biosteel’, kevlar vests
and artificial ligaments… in
fact, I think it deserves its own
post.

T
he past three weeks
have meant that
the previously
enjoyable activity of
looking at Facebook
has instead become
a daily battle of emotions
as I brace myself to learn of
another Trump shocker. A
travel ban on 7 countries,
banning organizations from
speaking to the public and
a petty fight over who had
the most fans “ever” at the
strange inauguration thing
– the headlines just keep
on coming from the Trump
establishment.
It is nigh on impossible
amongst all this mess to
determine what Trump’s
intentions are for his time as
President, and that includes
what he intends for US
science. Demanding lists of
climate scientists and electing
climate-sceptic Scott Pruitt
to lead the EPA are moves
that add up to form a clear
picture of a president with a
real agenda about climate
science. But could these
actions be indicative of wider
government policies to come?
Can we expect more interfer-
ing from Trump?
At the heart of all science
is the quest to determine
truth and fact. This does not
appear to be a dogma that
The Donald subscribes to. If
Trump has such little respect
for these two concepts (cue
Kelly-Anne Conway) it is
very unlikely that he sees the
concept of science as having
merit in its own right.
Much more likely is that
Trump sees science as
merely a means to an end,
specifically the means to his
end of an industrial America.
Science programmes that
have the ability to provide
instantly useful technolo-
gies for Trump’s favoured
industries are likely to enjoy
a boom under Trump, whilst
those sciences deemed to be
interfering or (god forbid) not
useful will be ridiculed and
side-lined.
This process, of picking and
choosing sciences to fund
purely on their perceived
usefulness in furthering polit-
ical agendas, has been seen
before. Under Stalin the USSR
had strict criteria for science
it liked and science it didn’t.
Mendelian genetics and other
biological sciences were
banned for being un-Marxist
practices supported by the
bourgeoisie. Statistical math-
ematics was abandoned and
the law of standard deviation
labelled a ‘false theory’. Early
cybernetics was ‘capitalist
pseudo-science’ and quantum
physics ‘idealist’.
These clampdowns on
‘ideological’ science occurred
at the same time as the expan-
sion of the Soviet nuclear
and astronomy programmes.
The glorification of certain
sciences seemingly excused
the brutal rubbishing of
science that fell outside of the
USSR’s ideals, leaving some
Russian sciences years behind
the rest of the world. Could
the same thing be about to
happen in the land of the
Science won’t be Trumped
Sara Hamilton reports on China’s new approach towards environmental legislation
I
can’t speak for everyone,
but when I think of
China in relation to the
environment, an image of
coal and smog-full Beijing,
with millions of citizens
running around in protective
anti-pollution masks, springs
to mind. Henry Wang, in his
talk Energy and Environment
Growth Strategies hosted by
the Imperial Energy Society,
brought a ray of optimism in
the future of China’s energy
mix and environmental
legislation.
Wang began his talk with
an overview of the global
energy, environment &
climate change strategies
worldwide, summarizing
many of the facts that are
frequently discussed as part
of this ‘great energy debate’
we seem to constantly
hear about. He underlined
projections showing the
expected global energy
demand to rise 50% in the
next 20-30 years, coupled
with the ambitious aim set in
the Paris Climate Conference
to limit global temperature
rise to 2°C by the end of the
century, corresponding to the
extremely limited CO2 atmos-
pheric concentration of 450
ppm. Although oil is expected
to remain in the energy mix
and provide at least half
this demand, the renewa-
ble industry is predicted to
boom, doubling its production
within 20 years to make this
decarbonation possible.
Although some countries
*cough* thanks Trump
*cough* are showing limited
action to meet their com-
mitment to these ambitious
global initiatives against
climate change, the Chinese
government, Wang claims, is
showing promising progress
in accomplishing significant
change. A few months ago,
China recently released
a finalized version of its
13th
Five-Year-Plan holding
important implications for the
future of its energy mix and
sustainable growth. Through
this plan, the government has
set out to reduce its carbon
intensity by 15% , following
the success in the previous
Plan which achieved a similar
reduction. As part of this
goal, the Chinese government
has committed more than US
$120 billion in an inter-city
high-speed rail. The plan also
sets out to accomplish ambi-
tious targets in air-pollution
control, requiring hundreds of
cities to meet ‘good’ or ‘excel-
lent’ standards 80% of the
time, meaning they must score
below 100 in China’s Air
Quality Index. Furthermore,
stricter limits on the emissions
of SO2 and NOx have been
placed, as well as those of
Volatile Organic Compounds
\\ China has

China charges ahead environmentally
(VOCs). Finally, policies have
also been introduced to tackle
two of China’s most serious
but less heard of environmen-
tal issues – water and soil
pollution.
It hence seems that the
environmentally endan-
gered China we know from
news broadcasts might soon
become a place of the past.
Maybe time for some of the
countries on this side of the
world to follow suit?

free?
With an administration that
says science should be left to
the scientists, whilst simulta-
neously electing anti-vaccine
activists to government health
panels, this is a real possibil-
ity. But this time there would
be one major difference. In
the years since the 1950’s,
science has become ever
more defined by international
collaboration and data shar-
ing. If scientific programmes
are attacked in America the
detrimental effects will be
felt across the globe. For
that reason we should carry
on steeling ourselves to sift
through the Facebook rants
and offensive tweets, looking
for changes to American
science policy. The world can
not afford to let science be
repressed again.

technologies for
Trump’s favoured
industries are likely
to enjoy a boom \\
