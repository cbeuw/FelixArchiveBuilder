CANCER
VIRGO
This week you think
you’re seeing things.
Just the other day you
were walking down the
street when a car pulls
over, Celine Dion jumps
out with a gun and into
a shop. You hear shots
and Celine comes out
all bloody. You should
quit pot.

This week every
night in my dreams,
I see you, I feel you,
That is how I know
you go on. Oh no, it’s
happening to you too.
You grab a knife from
the kitchen. Your last
words are “You can’t
have me!”
This week once more
you open the door
And you’re here in
my heart
And my heart will go
on and on.
This week you
decide to stay home
and Watch Titanic.
YOU COULD HAVE
SHARED! WHY! How
will your heart go on
without Jack? HOW?
This week you pop to
the corner shop to buy
some fags. The cashier
is singing along to the
radio. You recognise
the song. Is it Cher?
Suddenly Celine Dion
bursts into the shop,
and shoots the cashier,
shouting “Therer can
only be one!”
This week you see
someone far across
the distance, you start
crossing the street to
eliminate the space
between us, you want
to show you go on
but you realise it’s not
Celine Dion and lose
interest.
This week someone
says you have excessive
sentimentality. You didn’t
hear them, you were
listening to Celine Dion’s
My heart will go on on you
ipod nano.
This week you get
Celine Dion’s My heart
will go on stuck in
your head. You hum it
incesantly. You drive
your housemates crazy
until finally one of them
snaps and kills you.
#sorrynotsorry
This week your
housemate goes
missing. You feel
incredibly sad, but it’s
not because of that.
Celine Dion’s My heart
will go on has been
stuck in your head
and how can you even
continue living like
this?
This week you hear
about a Celine Dion
epidemic. You dismiss
it as a silly rumor until
you walk into the
library. It’s silent, but
for somoene’s muffled
humming. What are
they humming? Near...
far? Where–
This week you get into a
fight with your bestie cause
she says you look just like
Kim K, but you were really
going for a Celine Dion
vibe.
This week you fear
you are the sole
survivor in the city,
maybe the world.
Everyone else has been
claimed by the Celine
Dion Pandemic. You
don’t know if there’s
anyone out there.
You’re too scared to
turn on the radio.

Dear Chris
I’ve hit a wall, a ceiling in fact. A glass ceiling to be precise.
My lab supervisor is a sexist pig and continues to hand the
more difficult tasks to my male lab partner. The other day
he just came out and said that I couldn’t manage any of the
‘trickier’ procedures, due to my ‘delicate feminine nature’.
Like wtf brah? Does he even lift? No for real, I bench press
250. I can take him. Fight me. I dare you.
Anyway, I obviously need to handle this differently. I spoke
up the other day and was told off. But I clearly still think it’s
an issue.
Advice?
Yours,

Dear Barb,
In times like these I like to think of strong inde-
pendent women, like Elizabeth Warren. She
was warned, she was given an explanation,
nevertheless, #ShePersisted.
Sometimes though the only solution is violence.
Maybe next time you’re in the library, grab
that dolly the sheep papier mache sculp-
ture, take it to the laaaaaaaaab and smack
him with it repeatedly until he sees reason
#SheepAssisted.
So many women before you have given up,
left science and dismissed their career aspira-
tions. I personally think it comes down to shear
pressure. But after your stunt, people will say
“Not Baaaarbara, #SheepAssisted.
Don’t tell anyone of your violent plans. They’ll
HOROSCOPES
try and convince ewe that violence is never
the answer. They might ask ewe, ‘What woold
Jesus do?’. But ewe goat to stay strong.
#SheepAssisted
So lambast that baaaaaaastard and don’t
look baaaaack.
Ewe herd me.
Big luv,
Chris xxxx
