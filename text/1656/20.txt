Food?
For starters we got duck and
vegan spring rolls, sesame
crackers, and crispy street
style dough with a satay
sauce. The spring rolls each
came with different sauces
which complemented their
insides. They were cooked
well, hot on the inside, crispy
on the outside. Standard
spring rolls. The sesame
crackers tasted a bit like stale
bread with the texture of a
cracker. I didn’t like them
much because I prefer prawn
crackers. But if you’re veg-
etarian, like my friend who
shot-gunned the last one, I
feel like you’ll like them a lot.
The dough was interesting.
It wasn’t really crispy, more
chewy. The sweet satay sauce
made it taste more like a des-
sert than a starter. It definitely
felt like street food, and was
kind of like I was eating Indo-
nesian churros.
For mains, my friends all got
stir fry combos. The combo
came with nutty papaya
salad, flavoured rice and
cornballs, so it’s worth paying
for the upgrade. They said
it was really good. Not very
descriptive of them, but at
least they were happy.
I couldn’t decide which
meat to get in my Laksa soup,
so I got them all. Getting
a superior combo meant
my massive bowl of soupy
noodles came with prawn,
fishballs, beef, chicken and
vegetables. It had a good
balance of sweetness from the
coconut milk and sourness,

probably from the fish sauce
and lime juice. They gave it a
red chilli symbol on the menu,
but it only had a hint of spice
to me. Nonetheless it was
flavourful and really filled me
up. I packed away most of
it for my lunch the next day.
My friends finished their food,
but at the cost of waddling
instead of walking to the bus
stop.
Because we had tastecards,
the bill came to about £10
per person, which I think is
a really good deal given
the quality and size of our
starter and main. As well as
that, before 19:30 it’s happy
hour(s) so drinks are half
price too! It did take ages
to pay, as there was some
problem in the kitchen. The
waiter apologised profusely
though, which made it better
because they recognised we
were inconvenienced.
It’s good when a restaurant
serves good tasting food, but
here the food was so much
more than just that. It was
memorable. Every dish had a

than all the food having the

wide range of options on the
menu, so it does cater across
the spectrum for people who
are fussy and like simple
tastes, as well as those who
like trying new complex
flavours. It’s a chain so there
are branches all over London
making it easily accessible. I
would definitely recommend
going, I’ve already been
again twice since!
First Impressions?
From the minute we walked in the staff were very welcoming and sat us at
a spacious table with benches. The seating along with exposed brick walls,
and soft low-hanging lighting gave it a very chilled out vibe, like a beach
hut fused with a modern restaurant. The ambience certainly was in line with
their contemporary Indochinese theme.
Ordering took about 20 minutes, because there was just so much choice!
Our waitress brought us five different menus: main menu, vegetarian menu,
drinks menu, desserts menu, specials menu, and on the menus themselves
there were symbols identifying if dishes are vegan, vegan but with eggs,
gluten free, halal, recommended, spiciness levels, etc. After I attempted
to decipher these hieroglyphics, read all the menus, and remember
everything, I just asked the waitress for help. She had knowledge, which
was good because it’s such a let-down if the staff do not know about the
food themselves.
Where did you go?
On their way to the Royal Albert Hall, my friends and I caught
up in Banana Tree in Bayswater. I suggested the restaurant
because it’s about 30 minutes walking distance from campus,
and only 20 minutes from Wilson House and Pembridge. Ever
since she went on a yoga trip to Vietnam, one of my friends
has become a die-hard fan of far eastern cuisine. To appease
her, I suggested this place as they claim to serve contemporary
Indochinese food, and I thought it would be a nice change from
the traditional Chinese takeout we normally get.
