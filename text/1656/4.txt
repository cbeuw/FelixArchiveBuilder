Imperial students launch campaign to make
medical curriculum LGBT-inclusive
Michael Wilkinson discusses the lack of LGBT training in the NHS and
the steps that are taken to improve services for the queer community
T
he founding
principles of the
NHS were that it
should meet the
needs of everyone,
be free at the point
of delivery, and be based
on clinical need, not ability
to pay. Those of us watching
BBC’s Hospital last week, were
reminded of the importance of
these values, as we witnessed
overseas patients facing
exorbitant bills for life-saving
treatment.
Unfortunately, the NHS is not
meetingtheneedsofeveryone.
A recent government report
on transgender equality
addressed the very real
challenges facing trans people
in accessing health services,
highlighting “the persistent
refusal of some GPs to even
make referrals to gender
identity clinics”. A recent
survey of Imperial students
and bisexual men are used to
hearing from the Daily Mail
(denouncing HIV prevention
drug PrEP), but not something
we expect from our doctors.
LGB patients face similar
prejudices, with Stonewall’s
Unhealthy Attitudes report
revealing that a shocking
24% of NHS staff have heard
colleagues making negative
remarks about LGB people.
A similarly appalling 10% of
staff have heard colleagues
expressing the belief that
LGB people can be ‘cured’
using conversion therapy,
a sadistic practice that has
been condemned by most
major medical organisations.
Doctors have been quoted
statingthat“beingtransgender
is mostly a mental condition”
and ”deviations are not to be
considered by mainstream
society”, attitudes that don’t
belong in this century, never
mind our public services.
The belief held by many
that LGBT people are now
on equal footing with their
straight counterparts does
not match the experience of
the community, particularly
regardingaccesstohealthcare.
This is largely driven by a lack
of understanding, rather than
wilful discrimination, with
10% of staff not feeling able
to meet the needs of LGB
patients – rising to 24% for
trans patients. LGBT patients
face higher rates of sexually-
transmitted diseases, mental
health problems and addiction
whilst facing prejudice
and ignorance from health
professionals that discourage
them from seeking help.
Dr. John Dean, chair of the
committee advising the NHS
on gender identity services,
explained that “People
working in the service try to be
empathic; they are certainly
sympathetic, but they lack
a great deal of background
knowledge about gender
incongruence and dysphoria.”
This is symptomatic of a
medical education system
that is failing to prepare
future doctors to support trans
people, as well as the wider
health inequalities exist, there
is no teaching on the specific
challenges faced by LGBT
people. Some lecturers have
made an effort to be inclusive
in their teaching, but most fail
to maintain a basic distinction
the medical curriculum.
We’re aiming to include
compulsory teaching on
gender dysphoria, health
inequalities, and non-binary
gender identities/sexualities,
as well as more diverse sexual
health teaching. Medical
students are taught to always
communicate sensitively and
put the patient first, so we are
also campaigning to improve
clinical communication
teaching; small things like
asking about pronouns and the
sex of sexual partners make a
big difference to patients. A
laborious review of the current
curriculum has yielded a
comprehensive plan of where
teaching can be improved,
which was recently presented
to Mr. Lupton and Dr. Harris,
the Head and Deputy Head of
Undergraduate Medicine.
Thankfully, the faculty have
been very receptive to making
these improvements, and
they are being incorporated
into the ongoing curriculum
review process. It remains
to be seen whether this will
result in meaningful change to
teaching, but we are hopeful
that this will be implemented
– and make a real difference
to the future LGBT patients of
Imperial doctors.

queer community.
Imperial is no different in
this arena. One might expect
an internationally renowned
institutiontobeleadingtheway
in improving quality of care
for all patients, but the current
curriculum is frustratingly
light on LGBT issues. Apart
from a vague reference to
not discriminating against
patients on the basis of sexual
orientation or gender, and an
acknowledgement that LGBT
between gender and sex. One
of the most cited problems by
Imperial medical students
was that all gay men in our
practice exam questions have
HIV; it seems perpetuating
this stereotype is the closest
we can get to teaching about
LGBT inequality.
This has prompted a
campaign by a passionate
group of students, medical
and non-medical, queer and
straight allies, to improve

the abundance of tills,
insightfully pointing out that
“unluckily one person can’t
operate two tills.”
Anurag Deshpande, a final
year physicist says, “No one
knows how to use the tills
and it’s taking forever to get
served.”
Blythe has rebuffed criticism
by arguing that there’s been
“a few training sessions for our
staff in advance but it can take
time to get used to different
systems.”
The felix team, in an attempt
to separate fact from fiction,
ventured out from the safety
of the West Basement and
ordered a coke AND a pizza
while timing the whole ordeal.
We entered FiveSixEight at
1:43pm on a Thursday. The
bar was moderately busy.
There were two servers: one
behind the bar, one serving
food. Putting an order in took
three minutes and 24 seconds.

under the impression that
there never was a limit on
Yoyo payments anyway).
Theresa Davey, who has
spent nearly a decade at
Imperial says “I’ve never
had a problem with the limit
on card payments because
I know to give them a stern
look and bat my eyelashes”.
If you’re not Davey, though,
you’ll be happy to know that
the chip and pin payment limit
has been reduced to three
pounds (though if only it had
been reduced a further 40p
you would have been able
to get a snakebi– you know
what, no. Just get contactless
you lazy fu–)
Hey, you can even order
a shot of lime cordial, pay
20p for it on contactless and
proceed to do said shot of
cordial. If that isn’t progress,
we don’t know what is.
S
o you might
have heard – or
you might have
gathered from
seeing the long
lines of students
stretching from Beit all the way
down Exhibition Road – that
the Union has updated its tills.
The brand new tills and the
“fancy new yoyo scanners”
which were installed on
Monday, are promised to
increase speed of service.
Though so far they have only
increased frustration amongst
students eagerly awaiting to
be served, but being met with
empty tills instead.
As per tradition, Imperial
students have been incessantly
moaning about the “dismal
service” at every opportunity.
On Facebook, one Computing
undergraduate accused
Rachel Blythe, DPFS, of
“confusing her staff with these,
they’ve been struggling all
week”. Another one lamented
an additional one minute and
30 seconds. Getting our pizza
to take away took a final
eleven minutes.
Our research shockingly
proved inconclusive.
We also tried squeezing the
truth out of the staff on duty.
When asked how she felt
about the new tills one staff
member laughed awkwardly
and stared intently into the
pint of coke she was serving
us. Another staff member said
she hadn’t had the chance to
use the tills yet but that they
seemed fine. Coincidentally
the Head of Student Voice
swooped behind her to pick
up his lunch, but ran off before
we could get the chance to ask
any questions. He’s getting
faster. Regardless of whether
they’re any good, they were
probably expensive. Our
investigative team estimates
a cost around the £30,000
mark, but the DPFS has yet to
confirm the exact cost of the
project.
But enough about the tills.
There have been even more
radical changes that we
haven’t even touched upon
yet.
The £5 minimum spend has
been dropped from Apple
Pay, contactless and Yoyo
payments, (though we were
of it’s anti-immigration and
particularly anti-Somali
rhetoric but also due to his
pseudo-scientific arguments.
felix found the research
‘cited’ to be either unrelated
to the argument presented or
unreliable, having undergone
a dubious-at-best ‘peer-
review’ process.
The tweets eventually
resulted in a condemning
statement from King’s
Intersectional Feminist
Society and a subsequent
petition from King’s Somali
Society demanding a “formal
apology”.
“Somali students have
expressed hurt and anger that
such educator and peer could
express so much stigmatised
and ad hoc rhetoric directed
towards them, fellow Muslims
and black communities based
on nothing but unevaluated
statistics. To critique and
express opinion is a freedom
of speech, however to
expresses [sic] a dichotomy
that entrenches racism and
divisive intolerance should be
unacceptable at King’s.”
The apology was tweeted
from Perkins’ personal twitter
account following criticism
from felix in which it was
pointed out that “it is unclear
where Perkins’ apology can
be found; certainly not on
twitter.”
Numerous twitter users have
since come out in support of
Perkins with responses such
as “No good can come from
men of science yielding to cry-
bully lunatics” and “I knew
this would happen. So sad
and disgusting that you had
to cave to them in light of the
FACTS. Can’t go on like this.”
The original tweets have not
been deleted.
