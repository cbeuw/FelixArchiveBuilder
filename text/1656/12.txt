What's a queer gal to do/see/watch/listen to?
From under-representation in the media,
to a society that generally pretends we
exist only for the titillation of men, what's
a queer gal to do?!? B. R. Coli gives you
the low-down on all the culture picks for
you and your gal-pals

Desiree Akhavan directs and stars in this
comedy about an American-Iranian bisexual
going through a breakup. It’ll make you feel
worse about your recent breakup but then,
strangely, better. It’s pretty funny and feels
quite real. The protagonist also struggles
with coming out to her conservative family as
bisexual, which is cool because when does
that ever happen in film and TV? Almost never.
Even Orange is the New Black managed
to fuck up their bisexual storyline, dancing
around the subject and throwing out buz-
zwords like “Kinsey” but never actually saying
“BISEXUAL”.
Available on Netflix

But I'm a Cheerleader
I watched this film the day after I came out
to my family. I managed to unashamedly-ish sit
on the sofa on my laptop, while the rest of my
family roamed around near enough to catch a
glimpse of what I was watching. It was the first
time I felt near enough comfortable watching a
blatantly queer-appealing thing openly near
my family – But I’m a Cheerleader has some
pretty sentimental value.
This film really resonated with me at the
time. It might have been the aesthetically
pleasing pastels. It might have been the
comparison that I subconsciously drew
between Natasha Lyonne’s character get-
ting sent to conversion therapy camp and my
mum telling me liking girls was a phase that
therapy would fix it. Or it might just have been
seeing RuPaul playing a “heterosexual”.
Music
The gay Canadian
twins. You know the
ones. They’re playing
at the Roundhouse the
day before Valentine’s
day. Go!
Tegan and Sara The Internet
Really good music and better music
videos with non-gimmicky queer rep-
resentation. Syd Tha Kid (the singer) is
unashamedly really gay. There was no
big publicity stunt when she came out.
It went along the lines of “well look at
me, of course I’m gay”.
A very cool agender pansexual
rapper/poet that grew up in a cult,
Angel Haze’s combination of rap
and spoken-word poetry about love
will take you through all the forms of
heartbreak you’ve ever experienced.
Also, they dated Alec Baldwin’s
daughter – say no more.
