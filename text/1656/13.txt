Gaycation
We can all agree that Ellen Page is who we all
want to be. This show will make you want to
be her even more. It will also make you want
to travel all over the world, and after watching
Gaycation you’ll know where all the under-
ground queer experiences are, as well as the
different anti-gay elements within different coun-
tries. Watch if you enjoy any of the following:
Ellen Page being eloquent and insightful
Ellen Page wearing snapbacks
Ellen Page wearing cargo shorts
Ellen Page wearing oversized shirts
Gaycation is available online at Viceland

Jane the Virgin One Day at a Time
I was drawn to watch this under the misconception that it was about a queer Latina single mum but to save you
from the disappointment: she’s not queer (as far as we know). It is about a Cuban, ex-military, single mum living in
the US with two kids. Where’s the queer you may be wondering? Well, one of the kids is a teenage feminist.
It’s the first show I’ve seen that tackles coming to terms with lesbianism in adolescence in such a sensitive way.
Most shows take the following approach: “Our show is terrible and is losing viewers. We must bring out the lesbi-
ans. One of them must be blonde – everyone knows one of them must be blonde. Have you never seen porn? It’s so
the viewers remember that the ever so slightly butcher brunette one represents the 'man' in their relationship. Let’s
make them fall in love with their best never-explicitly-bisexual friend, or go for the 'got drunk, had sex, "oh my god
I’m gay"' approach. Ok we’ve run out of lesbian storyline. What do we do? Ask a queer to write a relatable story
about the hardships of queer love? Nah. We’ll kill one.”
Anyway. One Day at a Time is great. It’s very heartwarming and covers really great themes in a thoughtful
and realistic way, avoiding the familiar tropes faced by lesbians on screen. Again, Hispanic representation is top
quality.
One Day at a Time is available on Netflix
Like the love-child of a telenovela and
Pushing Dasies, this Netflix comedy
centres around Jane, a Latina woman
who is accidentally artificially insemi-
nated, and then has to decide between
the father of her child or her boyfriend.
Will she choose Raphael or the other
one? I don’t care! I’m watching this show
for the Latina lesbian gynaecologist
who accidently dates her drug-lord step
mum. Highly representative of the messy
complicated relationships us queer girls
always seem to find ourselves in.

Arts Queer Cabaret
SO QUEER. I’ve had a range of
experiences here, all of which have been
pretty great. There are about six acts per
night, and each is super different. You’ll
get drag queens, drag kings, non-binary
monarchs(?), stand-up, and musicians all
in one night, and all fairly-to-extremely
gender-bending. Don’t go expecting
RuPaul-esque drag: some will take their
clothes off and reveal a lot of glitter –
it’s messy, political, unpolished, arty
queerness.
Queer Cabaret is on every Tuesday at
the Royal Vauxhall Tavern
GRRRL ZINE FAIR
Not explicitly queer – but inherently so – this event has
a great community feel to it, and it’s an eary way to make
friends. Support zines! Meet cool feminists! Read and buy
cool zines. Make your own zines and prints! Watch weird
bands!
I discovered a band called Garden Centre at GRRRL ZINE,
whose lyrics run along the lines of “something cut me in the
rubbish / what if it’s teeth / what if I found you in the rubbish
and therefore you found me”. They’ve also just released their
first ever music video of a guy cutting a cob of corn in half in
slow motion – they’re terrible, but highly entertaining.
GRRRL ZINE FAIR will next be held at Moth Club on the
12th
of March
