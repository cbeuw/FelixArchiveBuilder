I found a home
in the LGBT
community
Windeth Elizabo is grateful for
the community's ongoing support
T
he LGBT community is the first
place that I found people like
me. For so many years of my life,
I lived in a state of confusion.
To finally discover people that
shared the same interests and
passions was incredible. I’ve been able
to make the lifelong friends that everyone
said would exist, based on shared
experience and camaraderie. It’s also
made me much more aware of societal
issues – it sounds a little selfish but it’s
much easier to get fired up and engaged
with anti-discrimination efforts when you
know people personally affected. The UK
is, honestly, one of the best places to be
trans. The healthcare system isn’t perfect
by any means, but they’re doing the best
with the limited resources that they have.
London especially has been wonderful
to me. When you’re very self conscious
about your appearance, one of the most
heartwarming things is when you step
onto a tube after agonising about stepping
outside for days and no one bats an eyelid.
I know some people criticise London for
people being rude and unsociable, but if
you’re in a position where you just want
to be yourself without causing a fuss,
it’s really not a bad thing at all. No one
minds, or cares. I never really fitted in at
school, and I don’t know if I fit in better
now, but there are so many more people
and the negative ones don’t matter as
much once you find or make a space that
you can call your own and support people
The LGBT
community
is inherently
flawed
Elizabeth Windo is cynical of the
community's very basis
with similar experiences that
you care about. IQ, Imperial’s
LGBT society, has undergone
several changes in this area –
last year the position of trans
& gender variant officer was
introduced for the first time.
Several other universities, such
as UCL and Kings, have done
the same, and have hosted
inter-university events which
really increases the size of the
community. I think, for better or
for worse, the notion of being
trans is now firmly entrenched
T
he LGBT community
is a misnomer.
It’s a group of
disparate people
pushed together by
societal pressure,
and pressure makes things
explosive. You only need to
look at the agenda pushed
by ‘gender critical’ feminists,
or the right wing ideologies
espoused by the ‘dangerous
faggot’ Yiannopoulis to see
that any pretence of unity is
founded on a certain level of
respectability politics. In wider
society, plenty of people
pay lip service to tolerance
but do not let that extend to
actually causing or being
part of change, reaching
the stage of ‘well, I guess I
wouldn’t disown my kids if
they ended up like that’ and
never progressing that much
farther. A community doesn’t
exist because the name exists.
It exists because you fight for
it, because you stick up for the
people you care about and
love and hope they would do
the same. It exists because it’s
all some people have.
The trans community itself is
a fundamentally malformed
construct, formed from people
S
V
in the public consciousness.
Even apps like Tindr now
incorporates gender options
that are no longer just the
binary ones. People really
try to get it, even when it’s
tricky, and I’m so thankful for
that. I’m proud to be part of
this, and to have met so many
inspiring people.
Am I happier, after going
through this process? Yes.
Would I do it all again? In a
heartbeat.
with nothing in common save a shared
experience of dysphoria. The intent of
the vast majority of trans people is to
eventually disappear from this group, to
ascend to the point where they can live in
society without ever once thinking about
their past. For this reason, any community
that exists is made up of the early birds
hunting for worms, and those a few years
down the road that aren’t quite able to
ascend out of it yet.
It’s a place where there’s the constant
looming shadow of suicide and violence,
where people go missing and noone
quite knows what happened – did they
ascend, tap out of life, were they caught
on the street and beaten to death? It’s
a place where you’re just a craigslist ad
away from finding sex work from some
closeted forty year old who subverts his
homosexual proclivities by saying ‘traps
don’t count, right?’. This sex work being
a stand in for a more steady job, denied
by institutional discrimination that doesn’t
want to deal with the hassle of hiring a
potentially mentally ill trans person, with
the funds going towards rent and the
medical treatments required to one day be
able to reintegrate with society and deal
with the self hatred and dysphoria.
It’s a place that is mine, and I will fight
for the continued survival of everyone in it.
Am I happier now, after going through this
process? Maybe. Would I do it all again? I
don’t know if I ever had a choice.

The Romanian
protests are an
unlikely beacon of
democracy
Claudia Mihai discusses the recent anti-
corruption protests in Romania
A
brief glance
at the main
h e a d l i n e s
and you can
see that the
past month
has been filled with protests,
discontent, and outrage.
While the world is watching the
United States, Eastern Europe
is facing its own demons as
formerly communist country
Romania is seeing its largest
protest since the fall of the
regime.
On Tuesday night, the 31st
of January, the Romanian
government passed an
emergency decree that
legalised corruption. More
specifically, it explicitly
decriminalised some
offences, including nepotism
and official misconduct
resulting in financial
damage under 200,000
RON (roughly £38,000). It
was initially supposed to be
effective immediately, but
was soon revised to only take
effect ten days later.
People across the country
went into the streets in the
middle of that very night;
there were 15,000 in
Bucharest alone, asking for
the government’s resignation.
It was only the next day they
found out that a temporary
replacement government
would not have the power
to repeal the decree.
The crowds immediately
\\ It seems unbelievable to
the Romanian government
that the people have
organised so well \\
changed their requests to
explicitly asking for repeal,
followed by resignation.
The press conference held
on Wednesday was also a
fuelling disaster. Avoiding
questions seemed to be the
theme of the event, as the
Ministry of Justice replied
with “Next question” a
grand total of 24 times. The
government did supposedly
repeal the decree on the
5th
of February, following
a protest that had already
grown beyond the country’s
borders. However, it appears
doubtful that the repeal is
valid. Additionally, they
immediately introduced the
same law for parliamentary
debate, where the leading
party also holds the majority
of seats.
Throughout these events,
Romanians have surprised
themselves and each other.
They are accustomed to the
less than elegant view that
Western Europe generally
holds of their country and
people. They also take pride
in their nation’s historical
achievements. It is the latter
feeling that has provided the
energy necessary during the
past couple of weeks.
Romania remembers
violence. So when a certain
football gallery was sent to
agitate the mass of protesters
in Bucharest, to give cause
for criticism, the people
detached themselves from
the violent group. When
a few run out of patience
after several nights in a row
of standing and shouting
in the cold, others calmed
them down quickly. They
supported and protected
each other.
It seems unbelievable to the
Romanian government that
the people have organised
so well. So unbelievable,
in fact, that government
officials have speculated
that they have been paid to
protest. However, it is solely
through social media and
word of mouth that these
protesters have organised
and kept informed. It only
took a couple of people
with knowledge of the law,
reading the decree and
explaining it, for it to spread
like wildfire.
It is clear that Romanians
are aware of how corrupt
their politicians are, and
they appear to have lost
hope as a result. It is why
too many choose not to
vote at all. That is obviously
the wrong decision, as the
consequences are painfully
clear now. However, they
have now “woken up” as
one of their main slogans
directly states. Moreover,
they are fighting against the
overwhelming corruption in
a rather traditional manner.
It is often in Romanian culture
and history that tragedies
are transformed into
'tragicomics' so as to better
cope. It comes as no surprise
then that the protests have
shown humourous slogans
and puppets representing
\\ Formerly
communist Romania
is seeing its largest
protest since the fall
of the regime \\
the political individuals at
the core of this discontent.
Social media also seems
to be equal parts serious
discussions and memes.
I wish I could be home for
these events. I only attended
the protests in London on
Friday and Saturday, and I
had not expected too much
energy. However, I am both
ashamed and happy to say
that I underestimated the
anger that unites us. Being
away from home has not
killed our roots.
It was during the evening
hours of Saturday that I
found myself protesting next
to a gentleman with the
somewhat classic look of
a middle-aged bohemian.
I had not paid attention at
first, but amongst the shouts
all around me, I overheard
that he had attended both the
revolution of December 1989
and the Mineriad of June
1990. It is a particular sort
of pain I felt then; the kind
that arises when I'm eminded
that the people who have
participated in those events,
hoping for a better future,
are still here to witness what
is happening now.
The communist era of
Romania has become a
leitmotif in our culture. Some
miss the good old times,
although most vow it will
never happen again. We
have either lived through it or
been raised hearing about it.
However, reading coverage
of these weeks’ events in the
British media, I saw Romania
described as “an unlikely
beacon of democracy.”
While flattering, I disagree
with the sentiment. It is
perhaps through the tragedy
of our past that we are more
likely to fight for our present.
