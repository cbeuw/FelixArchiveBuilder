Heroic Hugh
in Desperate
Mercy Dash
Chem Eng student Hugh Southey
saved a pigeon from a gory death on
Monday. The reluctant hero
snatched the bird from the path of a
demon taxi driver.
It seemed just like an ordinary day
for Hugh. Until he saw the bird in
peril, that is.
And then he leapt into action. "It wax
amazing," said bystander Mike
Newman. "Whenever I've had a bird,
it's always died."
Hero Hugh rushed the stunned bird
to the FELIX Office where Union
first-aider Maz Fellows was
consulted.
And Maz knew just what to do!
She phoned the Health Centre
in Princes Gardens imme-
diately. Within seconds the
receptionist had the answer.
"Take the pigeon to Mr Mooney!
He'll chop off its head!"
But outraged Hugh had a better
idea! "We'll take it to the vet!"
After a desperate mercy dash to a
local surgery, the astounded vet
deloused the pigeon and
sent it home with Hugh. "I'll feed it
on processed peas and water"
commented Mr Southey.
And Hugh is aware of the College
regulation specifically forbidding the
introduction of livestock into
College Halls of Residence!
The pigeon was too upset to
comment.
GOTCHA!
