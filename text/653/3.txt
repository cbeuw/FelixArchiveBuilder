Moonies
Members of the United Unifi-
cation Church, or Moonies us
they are better known, have been
attempting to recruit IC students
;iround campus and the Halls of
Residence throughout the past
two weeks.
The sect have not revealed
their name to the people they
have approached but have merely
asked them to fill in a question-
naire. An invitation to a free meal
at their Lancaster Gate head-
quarters is then offered.
Freshers
Balls Up
Two Albert Hall Mansion resi-
dents were up in arms over the
full-blooded reggae sound of
Clint Eastwood and General
Saint as they blasted out during
the small hours of Saturday mor-
ning at the Freshers Ball.
The band were playing well
after they were supposed to stop
because they started their session
an hour late due to General Saint
'getting himself lost'.
The residents called in the po-
lice, who warned President
Gaynor Lewis of possible legal
action. Miss Lewis defused a po-
tentially explosive situation by
keeping the police away from the
Union Building while the band
were playing.
Alarm in
Mines
The Royal School of Mines build-
ing was evacuated on Tuesday
morning as hordes of gas-masked
firemen leapt through the win-
dows in a fire drill.
The firemen entered a third
floor window and successfully
brought out a dummy from
amidst the smoke and flames.
The firemen were hindered in
their daring rescue by hundreds
of students congregating in the
doorways.
The College fire officer, Mr
Bob Foggon pointed out that this
was a major safety hazard and
appealed to students to stay well
clear of buildings in a event of a
fire alert.
Mr Foggon denied that the in-
cident was a cleverly disguised
mascotry raid by QMC.
A scientist from the Metropolitan
Police Forensic Science Depart-
ment gave an entertaining,
though rather gory, lecture to an
audience of over 70 in Elec Eng
lecture theatre 408 at the invita-
tion last Monday of the H G
Wells Society.
The talk was illustrated by
slides from the Department's files
showing bodies which had
suffered horrific injuries, such as
smashed skulls or abdominal
twisting. Others showed maggot-
eaten corpses and the aftermath
of an attack by alsatian dogs.
Sick bags were unfortunately not
provided.
The talk also covered the latest
techniques used by the police
such as laser interference
methods for detection of foot-
prints on carpets and other
surfaces long after they were
made.
Meanwhile, controversy con-
tinued to rage over the design of
the poster advertising the event.
The poster depicted a naked man
wielding an axe over two naked
women, one of whom has been
decapitated. If a formal com-
plaint is made to the Union.
Wellsoc could face a fine as they
did last year for producing
obscene publicity. However, the
man from the Met apparently
approved of the design and took
one away with him to show his
colleagues at Scotland Yard.
New Sport
Shop
The sale of sports goods and
regalia has been transferred from
Southside Shop to a new Union
Shop on the Shcrfield Walkway.
Deputy President Christine
Teller said she felt that a better
service could be offered by
having separate outlets for gro-
ceries and sports equipment.
Thieves started early this session
in the College libraries. Thefts of
w a l l e t s , purses and o t h e r
personal belongings are an all too
familiar occurrence here as in all
the other colleges of the Univer-
sity, but on Tuesday 27 Septem-
ber a more daring raid was made
on the Haldane Music Library.
While the Music Librarian was at
lunch a thief climbed through the
enquiries window from the Music
Library into the locked office and
stole the cartridges from the two
record decks used for the Listen-
> ing Room, together with a cash-
box containing money belonging
to the Youth and Music group
run by the Music Librarian to
obtain discounts on concert
tickets.
Since the theft occurred al the
busiest time of day, it is possible
that someone saw the thief. Any
information would be welcomed
by the Haldane Librarian and
would be treated in confidence.
Wham Bam Thank you Mam!
Imperial College Rag got off to a flying start with City and Guilds and the Royal College of
Science Unions taking over Covent Garden and Halls of Residence respectively. Guilds raised the
incredible sum of £359 by allowing members of the public to splatter them with flans and shifting 600
dubious Rag Mags. STOIC, the underwatched College TV station with their usual panache also
managed to get totalling covered in shaving foam. RCS not to be outdone raised a meagre £85 by
collecting in U L U Halls of Residence.
