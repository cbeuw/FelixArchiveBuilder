FELIX i B i i i ' f i i i i i r i i i i r i
n iiiii m i n i m
sion, after informing readers that
sex is forbidden in the' Union
Building except where "discreet
and unavoidable", MST went on
to reveal that at least one couple
had coupled on Union premises.
Little surprise to find that one of
the participants was self-styled
'Casanova' MST himself! Not
very discreet of him to publish it
in FELIX though, was it? The
lady in question said: "He's got
the apparatus but it's well out of
practice".
This isn't the first time that
MST might have been advised to
keep his gob shut. The other
occasion that springs to mind is
when the self-styled 'gastro-
nome' visited a local restaurant.
He ordered moussaka, the
waiter brought it to the table, he
started to eat it. But all was not
well. A terrific scream shrilled
from his slavering lips. "Why isn't
there any pasta in my mous-
saka?" It was left to the long-
suffering waiter to explain that
moussaka is a Greek dish that
contains N O pasta.

inform readers that the snivelling
bearded liar is no more than a
self-confessed hyprocrite and a
damned fool.
Not only was he caught in a
Southside toilet (?) reading
porno mags, but he was also
involved in producing some
revolting publicity for Wellsoc.
The poster in question had tits
and willies plastered all over it,
not to mention decapitated rape
victims.
On another occasion he was
founding ogling naked girls in
Mews flats with a pair of 20x50
binoculars.
He can't be very hopeful of his
chances of getting his ridiculous
motion passed now.

Andy was surprised to see a
female figure playing in the sand
and singing loudly. She had filled
up a plastic bollard with sand and
