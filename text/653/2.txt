Letters H
Large Bore
Slug
Dear Pallab
Re last week's letter by 'Slug':
for those not in the know, 'Slug'
is Steve Bishop, who as ex-
President of City and Guilds
Union and a prominent mem-
ber of Links Club probably
knows as much as anyone at
Imperial about barnights and
drinking clubs.
Unfortunately on this occa-
sion Steve has got hold of the
wrong end of the stick and
chewed it into a pile of verbal
sawdust. What he seems to be
trying to say (and it really is not
clear) is that in the Handbook I
should have described the
Union Bar as it was five years
ago or as it could, with luck, be
later this year but certainly not
as it was at the time of writing.
Nothing (well, almost nothing)
would have pleased me more
than to have been able to
describe the bar as "the lively,
knock-about bar of yester-
year". Unhappily, it wasn't, it
still isn't, and as I had no reason
to tell freshers otherwise, I
didn't.
Steve does not suspect that 1
wrote parts of the Handbook;
he knows it perfectly well. But
in a confused kind of way, he
imagines that as I was Editor,
actually writing things as well
was somehow cheating, and
that therefore I am not to be
trusted. Oddly enough, as
FELIX News Editor last year I
wrote quite a lot of news, and
nobody complained then.
(Wanna bet?-Ed.)
But if Steve is really sure that
I have forced a nasty, warped,
depraved view of Imperial upon
unsuspecting freshers he might
read page 6, on which Hugh
Southey. the Chairman of the
Internal Services Committee,
had independently reached the
same conclusions as I did not
only on the Union Bar but also
on the other bars and refec-
tories.
Other than a few predictable
complaints from people who
view the Handbook as a free
advertising service, I have so far
received very little useful feed-
back from those for whom the
Handbook was actually writ-
ten.
Anyone with criticism, sug-
gestions or (unlikely, this) praise
for the Handbook can contact
me directly via physics U G
letter-racks or the FELIX Of-
fice. Hacks with a political axe

to grind and societies' publicity
officers shocked that their
articles were cut to only twice
the permitted length will be
fobbed off—fob off!—but I
may even buy a cup of coffee for
any first year students who will
tell me how helpful or otherwise
they found the Handbook.

No Thanks
Dear Pallab
Feeling anything but fresh
from the hectic happenings of
Freshers' Week I want to say a
few words on behalf of the other
bemused first years who sat
through the UGM last week.
Comments after the meeting
ranged from "What a sham-
bles!" to "I don't understand".
The general consensus amongst
first years I talked with was that
Union meetings were not to be
placed highly in the list of lunch
time activities unless one was
specifically interested in paper
aeroplane design and perfor-
mance.
This was sad considering the
importance of encouraging as
many new people as possible to
get involved.
The Union is important as
the decisions that it takes affect
all the students in the College,
but to make it democractic it
needs to be seen to be relevant
to a complete cross-section of
the College which is not the
present case.
Yours hopefully

Dear Pallab
We feel that Urgent (if not
immediate) action is required to
change the Union games ma-
chines so that any member of-
our illustrious, free and demo-
cratic Union can enter the
Union games room and pur-
chase, with a single two shilling
coin, a one player game of
either Space Dual or Centipede,
according to his right as a
citizen of this ancient and
distinguished realm, instead of
having to use, one of those poxy
5p-imitation, twenty pence
'coins'.
Christine Teller is (irres-
ponsible as usual.

Dear Sir
I was sorry to see, in your
edition of 3 October, the head-
line "No fun in Southside—
Official", above an article
which might give the impres-
sion that Mews residents are a
lot of humourless killjoys. I
don't think we are and I hope
there is plenty of fun in
Southside under the new rules.
We feel we have suffered
from too many downright
dangerous incidents recently
and an intolerable amount of
noise (a hot summer night can
produce Led Zeppelin and
Beethoven and Jimi Hendrix
and Motorhead, all blasting
away at us at once from
different open windows—it's an
amazing sound!).
Many of us have enjoyed the
friendship and hospitality of
Southsiders over the years and I
only hope that new residents
there will accept that too much
fun 'up there' can be no fun
'down here'.
With best wishes.
Yours faithfully
Doreen Whewell (Mrs)

UGM
More Please
Dear Sir
The freshers have now had a
chance to settle in at College
and witness the appalling state
of affairs the College and Union
revel in. The propagation of
outdated conservative tradi-
tions under the facade of being
'apolitical' nice guys. The un-
derhand manipulation of pro-
cedures at UGMs to avoid the
issues. All in the cause of
preserving their 'Imperial'
image.
Some freshers may be won-
dering where all this right wing
influence conies from, its
certainly not from ConSoc,
who are more concerned with
cheese and wine parties and
shaking MPs hands—their only
claim to fame is their selection
of amusing button badges, each
with its own perverse slogan.
I would just like to inform the
freshers of the real danger to
common sense and rational
discussion. The Students Union
is here to represent you and
your views. At the moment,
Union General Meetings, "the
sovereign body of IC Union",
seems to be dictated to by a
small group of mindless stu-
dents from RSM, who herd
fellow miners into the Great
Hall with the sole intention of
squashing any progressive mo-
tion. They will use any way they
can, no matter how dubious it
appears.
My message to all those who
were insensed by the events at
the last U G M , or who have
simply given up going because
of this. My message to you is to
turn up at the next UGM, 8
Nov. Then we will show them
the power of democracy. Look
out for the coordinate cam-
paign.
Yours faithfully
Martin Attwell,

PS: Anyone interested in sub-
mitting a progressive motion
for the next U G M please
contact me for help and coor-
dination.

Dear Pallab
Last week I was asked by an
RCS fresher if he could join
RSMU. Need we say more?
