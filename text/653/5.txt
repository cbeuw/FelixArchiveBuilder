Michael Newman writes
to protest about the
peddling of pornography
by the Union.
A motion was defeated at
the U G M on Thursday 6th
October by manoeverings
using a wild interpretation of
the Union standing orders
and the now famous Mines
b l o c k vote. The m o t i o n
sought to stop the Union
selling pornographic entert-
ainment. F E L I X has been
printing drawings and photo-
graphs seeking to provoke
emotional replies and fill the
letters page. Is it not about
time we heard the rational
arguments!
I issue a challenge to the
Mines Union and to Imperial
College Union to defend their
position, not with boos and
hisses from a 'Save Mines
Action Squad' or misuses of
the U G M standing orders,
but in a f o r m a l debate
chaired by Debsoc. I person-
ally do not think they can
succeed.
British society restricts the
sale of pornography. Its laws
do not allow anyone under
eighteen to buy such material.
Shops are not allowed to
exhibit such goods in their
windows. The production
and importing of pornogra-
phy is severely restricted.
It is widely recognised that
porn is degrading and even
corrupting. Most debates
revolve around freedom to
buy and sell, not the conse-
quences of doing so.
The debate within college,
an unavoidable debate so
long as Mines continue to sell
porn, is whether the argu-
ments behind the British laws
are correct. It is not about the
individual freedom to buy
and sell this material. Stud-
ents, along with ali other
British subjects over the age
of 18, have the right to buy
porn. It is about a democratic
body selling pornographic
enterrtainment. This means
every single member of the
Union is a party to its sale. If
a Union sells pornography
then the organisers cannot be
held entirely responsible, for
the Union is responsible and
the Union is its members, you
and me.
Once this is made absol-
utely clear, the 'fight for
freedom' argument is dis-
f missed and all of us are left
iwith the question 'do I want
to sell pornography?' T o
consciously say yes is to
ignore the arguments put
forward by all governments
(including the present one)
and this society in general.
Your answer cannot be the
same as the pornographic
industry's as you personally
do not benefit from the sales.
The only rational motive can
be that you wish to further
the interests of the industry
because it is good. You wish
to tell everyone 'I am for
porn because it is good.'
So long as Mines and
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e U n i o n
express their active support
for this industry, then we as
individuals do. So long as
this situation remains we
should do our utmost to
change it. We should express
in words what is expressed so
well in actions, that our
Union supports pornography.
