1st XI vs NPL 1-3
2nd XI vs NPL 1-5
3rd XI vs Sunbury 0-1
4th XI vs Windsor 0-2
For the first Saturday of the season the newly
forged teams proved themselves a little brit-
tle, but workmanship of the highest quality
was on view. Under the new captaincy of Pete
Cunningham the 1st XI fell foul of NPL,
losing 3-1, though had a few early chances not
eluded conversion the game may have ac-
quired a different hue. Conducive to defeat
was the neophyte nature of the team; the play
at times was frenetic and lacking in pattern,
and this, combined with a shaky defence lead
to a half time deficit of two goals, despite the
leviathan Geoff Ayres. Keen freshers
bolstered all XI's, their enthusiasm meant a
second half recovery in both the 1st and 2nd
XI games, sustaining the action to the very
end. Undoubtedly the teams will build on the
foundations already laid and the results can,
and will, only improve. Personally I leave the
rest up to the more acrostic among you.
The London Student Ten Pin Bowling Club is
based at Imperial College. However, the cen-
tre of the club's activities is situated at
Tolworth Bowl, south west of London. A
coach leaves Imperial College at 2:30pm
every Wednesday during term time.
In addition to bowling every Wednesday,
the Club selects its best players to compete in
the National Universities League, bowling at
home and away to Brunei, Southampton and,
Portsmouth in the Southern regional league.
The winners of this section go on to the
national finals.
Even if you are not good enough to be
picked for the club, you can still bowl in the
tournaments organised by many universities
and colleges over the country, all of which are
handicap—so you could be the worst player
in our club and still win a tournament with
not too great a performance.
So, even if you have never played before,
come along on Wednesday (or any Wednes-
day for that matter). You'll probably see
players who've been for years and still look as
though they've just started!
The meeting place is Chem Eng foyer.
Looking forward to seeing you.
