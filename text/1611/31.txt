ICURFC offers members a full
and diverse social calendar, as well

facilities that Imperial has to offer.
ICURFC is made up of three
teams. The third team, which plays
in South Eastern 7A, offers a solid
entry point for beginners and less
experienced players. The second
team plays in South Eastern 5B
league, this squad is perfect for
intermediate to advanced players
looking to develop their skills
further. The first team plays in
South Eastern 2B and offers an
environment for advanced players to
take their game to the next level.
All teams have access to
high quality coaching staff and
conditioning sessions during term

sessions are also incorporated for
more advanced players.

R
ugby is probably
something you’ve been
hearing a lot about
recently, what with the
World Cup currently gracing the
pitches of England. But if you’re
just following score updates, or even
religiously watching every match,
you’re missing out on a whole lot of
the fun of the sport – and we can
help you with that! University is
a perfect opportunity to come and
get a taste of what rugby’s all about,
whether you’re a clean-faced fresher
or an Imperial veteran. So what
do we do at IC women’s rugby?
Obviously, we play rugby. We play
against other universities once or
twice a week during rugby season
(November-March), preparing with
weekly training sessions. Every
training session brings us closer
to being a slick, well-oiled rugby
machine, something which can only
come with team practice. The sense
of camaraderie born on the pitch
is increased tenfold at our weekly
socials: every Wednesday our two
lovely social secretaries organise an

evening of merriment so we can all
relax, forget all that Imperial stress
and have a good time as a team.
Sometimes this means a karaoke
evening at the pub, or a civilised
round of Come Dine With Me, and
sometimes it means heading to
one of our university bars in fancy
dress to join in on sports night. If
that weren’t enough, we go on tour
twice a year – last year saw us hit
Southampton, with an inevitable
visit to the infamous Jesters, and
Newquay, where we entered the
‘social’ league for a more casual
weekend.
Imperial rugby wants you!
As England’s dreams of Rugby World Cup success hang in the balance, Imperial
College’s rugby clubs tell use why the sport is so great
We’re a really friendly society,
and we’re unusual in that there’s
no separation between medics
and non-medics, so here’s your
chance to mix with people outside
your subject! We’re from all years,
undergrad to PhD, so if there is
someone who does your subject,
you’ve got a helper on standby if
you’re ever stuck on your course.
Most importantly, though, we’re
mixed ability - we love to win, but
mostly we love to play, and the more
the merrier! Most of our players
came to us as complete beginners,
so it absolutely doesn’t matter if
you’ve never played before – and if
you have, maybe you can show us
a thing or two. If you’re still not
convinced we’re the best society
going, we’d love you to come chat to
us at fresher’s fair or at one of our
other fresher events. Our first one’s
on move-in day, we’ll be in Prince’s
Gardens from 10am playing touch
rugby with the boys before heading
to Eastside bar to watch the world
cup, so come join in!
We’ve got a lot more going on
in Welcome Week, so head to our
website for more information. We
hope to see you soon!

F
or five days in September,
Imperial Ultimate
Frisbee Club attended
Burla Beach Cup, a
three-day international tournament
held on the sandy beach of Torre
de Lago, Italy. It was an enjoyable
and challenging weekend for the
team who attended, with Imperial
discDoctors (dD) finishing 13th
out of 16 teams in their division.
For the majority of the group, this
tournament represented the first
time they would compete against
top-level club teams from around
the world and also the first time
they would play beach Frisbee.
The team of fifteen all arrived
in Italy ready to take on a new
challenge and to have fun both on
and off the pitch. On the first day
of the tournament dD faced a tough
group stage and managed to come
third in their group of four. The
final game of the day was a cross-
over match against a strong Italian
team. Despite not being aware of
this game and swimming in the
sea until five minutes before it was
due to start, dD put in a very strong
performance but were unable to
secure a win. Once the game had
finished, dD were able to relax on
the beach and watch the sun set in
style with the mountains behind
them.
The next day was an early start
and a brand new pool, based on
Friday’s results to compete in. The
team found this group more suited
to their level of play and were able
to finish second overall, after a close
defeat by the Warwick University
alumni team, where dD struggled
against an all-male team with
experience and athleticism. The
final game was another cross over
match, against yet another Warwick
University team. It was hard fought
by the discDoctors but yet again
they could not break through their
opponents to reach a win.
That evening dD attended the
tournament party, which was ‘Kings
and Queens’ themed. With the
party being held on the same site
as the team’s accommodation, this
was a great opportunity for the
team to relax after another day of
ultimate, mingle with players from
other teams and get dressed up! Tin
foil proved a useful asset to costume
making, with crowns and even
dragon wings being made to keep
with the party theme.
With another early start on
Sunday, dD were beginning to
tire from the hard days of playing.
However, they managed to sail
through their first game of the day.
Although the team were tired from
the night before, dD managed to
reach the point cap of 13 whilst
conceding only a few points. The
team was working well together
and communicating effectively with
the disc easily flowing between the
handlers – dD had reached their
stride.
Winning their first game meant
that dD were to play Sky Hawks,
an experienced Swiss team they had
beaten the previous day. The last
match had been close, but Imperial
knew it would be even tougher this
time round. discDoctors had the
initial momentum and managed to
draw out a lead before Sky Hawks
battled back with some big grabs
in the end-zone to bring the scores
level at eight all. The final point of
the game was again close, with both
teams turning over, however dD
stayed patient on the disc, before a
forehand caught easily in the end-
zone brought the game to an end,
and Imperial to a final finishing
place of 13th.
For a team not used to playing on
sand and who always tried to have
at least two women per line in a
mostly male division, discDoctors
played extremely well over the
weekend,which is promising for the
upcoming university season.
Ultimate Frisbee train twice
a week and regularly compete
in tournaments throughout the
Autumn and Spring terms. All
are welcome to attend training,
regardless of experience. Please

A
s a fresher, you’re
bombarded with
propaganda from
different clubs and
societies telling you what fun you
can have if you join their gang.
How many provide any proof of
this? At Imperial College Boating
Club, we offer more than that. We
are consistently the most successful
sports club at Imperial, ranking
3rd
at BUCS regatta this year,
qualifying 8 crews for Henley Royal
Regatta and winning a silver medal
at the European university rowing
championships. Even if you’ve
never rowed before, ICBC can be
the club for you. Every year we have
an excellent novice programme for
people who haven’t rowed before
and even devote a coach specifically
for this group!
But it’s not all hard work either.
We do fresher’s week properly and
play host to some legendary parties
throughout the year. Our toga party
is our flagship social and is spoken
of in hushed tones throughout the
land.
If you’re still not sold, come along

our Putney boathouse. These are

questions about ICBC.
