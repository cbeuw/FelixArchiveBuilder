F
or most students, the move
to University coincides with
thefirsttimeinyourlifethat
you’re 100% responsible for
looking after yourself. One of the
biggest challenges for many will be
learning how to make tasty, healthy
meals on a budget.
Some of you may never have
cooked before, and with that in
mind FELIX Food are presenting
four simple, basic recipes to try out
while you’re still learning which end
of the spatula is which – plus a few
extra tips to get you going as you’re
unleashed in the Hall kitchens.
I’ve given you the recipes for my
legendary chocolate brownies, a
fresh pasta sauce for when you get
sick of the stuff in jars, chicken
fried rice to help use up leftover rice
and vegetables, and classic British
comfort meal: toad in the hole.

Freshipes: How to make a basic...
Four fabulous foods to get you started in the challenging task of feeding yourself
Ingredients:
250g unsalted butter
200g dark chocolate (70% cocoa)
80g cocoa powder
65g plain flour
1 tsp baking powder
360g caster sugar
4 large eggs
75g white chocolate chips
75g mixed nuts (brazil, hazelnut)
Start by melting the chocolate
and butter together (microwave in
10 second blasts and stir). Mix all
the dry goods together in a bowl
and add the chocolatey mix.
Beat the eggs together then
stir into the rest until everything
is combined. Add the nuts and
chocolate chips last, then pour
into a brownie tin or any dish with
tall enough sides. Bake at 180ºC
for about 25 mins; they should be
cooked through but still fudgy.
...Chocolate Brownie
Ingredients:
1x 400g tin plum tomatoes
1 stick of celery
1 carrot
1 large onion
1 tbsp tomato puree
1 tbsp olive oil
salt and pepper
a handful of fresh basil (or dried)
bay leaf or any other herbs
Finely chop your celery, carrots
and onions. Fry them up in the oil
until they soften up and get a light
brown colour.
Pour in the tomatoes and add the
herbs, salt and pepper to taste, plus
a glass of water. Mix it all up and
cover with a lid.
Simmer the mixture on a low
heat for half an hour, stirring it
occasionally. Try not to let it boil.
Make a big batch and store the
leftovers in the freezer.
...Pasta Sauce
Ingredients:
400g cold pre-cooked rice
1 tbsp sunflower/groundnut oil
2 medium eggs
2 spring onions
1 carrot
50g frozen peas
50g sweetcorn
150g chicken thighs
salt and pepper
Cook your chicken first – just fry
it off in the pan with a little oil until
it browns. Chop your vegetables up
small (or just grab a bag of mixed
veg out of the freezer and chuck
some in the microwave to defrost).
Remove the chicken from the
pan and heat some more oil. Move
the rice around in it until it’s hot
through, then add the beaten eggs.
Stir like crazy for a minute then
throw in your vegetables. Add
spring onions last for some crunch.
...Chicken Fried Rice
Ingredients:
6 pork sausages
2 tbsp beef dripping (or any
flavourless vegetable oil)
140g plain flour
2 eggs
125ml semi-skimmed milk
50ml water
salt and pepper
dried sage
Fry the sausages in oil for 10-
15 mins until brown – or save on
washing up by baking them in
a deep-sided dish. Make up the
batter mix by combining the flour,
seasoning, and both eggs first.
Whisk the mixture for a few
minutes while slowly adding the
milk and water. Get your pan
sizzling hot – the oven should be
at 220ºC – and pour the batter
in. Cook for 25 mins until golden
brown, then serve with gravy.
...Toad In The Hole
There are tonnes of resources
online to help you find recipe ideas.
I recommend the BBC Good Food
website, Jamie Oliver’s YouTube
channel for videos on how to prepare
a range of basic to more complicated
meals, and the Guardian’s Word of
Mouth blog for its ‘How to cook a
perfect...” series.
If you’re starting to get a queasy
feeling in your stomach every time
you view your bank balance,consider
hitting up the local supermarkets
after around 9pm. Most, if not all,
will have a reduced price section
for items coming up to their ‘best
before’ date.
You can often find very cheap meat
and vegetables that – with a little
imagination – you can turn into a
decent meal, as well as sandwiches
and salads if you just want to grab
something light before heading
back to your library all-nighter.
