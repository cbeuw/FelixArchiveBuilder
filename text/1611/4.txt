IMPERIAL MEDICS ORGANISE PROTEST
3000 medical
students and junior
doctors marched
on Whitehall
O
n Monday, around three
thousand junior doctors,
medical students and
supporters marched on
Whitehall to demonstrate against
the proposed changes to junior
doctors’contracts.The protest began
outside the Methodist Central Hall
in Westminster, near the Houses
of Parliament, where a meeting
between the NHS and some junior
doctors about the proposed changes
was supposed to be taking place.
When this meeting was cancelled
halfway through the day, organisers
of the evening’s protest encouraged
supporters to come along anyway.
Jennie Watson, Deputy President
of Welfare of Imperial’s own student
Union, was one of a handful of
students who arranged the protest.
She predicts she was joined on the
march by several hundred students
from Imperial’s medical school.
One of those was Med Harris, the
school’s Union President. Both of
these positions are elected and paid
sabbatical roles.
After an hour of shouting and

hall, protesters with megaphones
maneuvered through the large group
and headed towards Parliament.
The handful of police officers who
were stationed to look after the
event seemed vaguely surprised
at the movement, but were far
outnumbered by a growing crowd
of young, well-educated and well-
behaved medics.
Organisers, including medical
students from Imperial, had only
applied for a stationary protest
permit, and it was obvious that

Although almost five

on Facebook, police seemed
unprepared for such a crowd.

concern is safety, and that long

the police weren’t expecting any
deviation from this. It is technically
illegal to stage a march without
letting the police know at least six
days beforehand, but the timeline of
the protest and good behaviour of
the crowd meant that the organisers
are unlikely to face any action from
the police.
The group moved across to
Parliament Square, joined by
swathes of junior doctors, getting
off shifts with some having brought
young children. The road around

to walk down Whitehall.
Instead of Downing Street, the
group congregated around the
Department of Health. Doctors
crossed the roads in huge numbers,
stopping cars and buses, none of
whom had been stopped further
up. Whether the horn tooting
that ensued was in frustration, or
as the crowd interpreted them, in
support, it wasn’t going to make any
difference. The junior doctors knew
where they were heading, what they

money,” she

safety”
wanted, and who they wanted to
see. After congregating around
the health ministry, they bayed for
Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary,
while he tweeted from safety, most
likely from home, about childhood
obesity.
When Hunt didn’t emerge from
the grey buildings, despite cries of
NO IFS, NO BUTS, NO JUNIOR
DOCTOR CUTS, the crowd
turned on its heel, slower than
before, and edged back towards
Parliament and Big Ben. None of
this movement was planned, and
the wild gesticulation involved in
encounters between organisers and
police officers made this obvious.
As a giant red moon rose above
Westminster, police stopped
traffic again, allowing protesters
to cross back. Someone with a
megaphone meekly asked if people
could disperse, but with Whitehall
closed in one direction and traffic

“We’re here as medical students and junior doctors in protest at
the announcement by NHS Employers [the organisation in charge
of NHS employers in England] that they were going to go ahead
and enforce the DDRB recommendations [the independant report
on contract reform for doctors and dentists in training].”
“The BMA, the representation body for the medics, were in
negotiation with NHS Employers, but they had to withdraw from
the negotiation process because they couldn’t see an adiquate, safe
way forward. The meeting was called off only hours before we were
meant to come here, but I think it’s a great turnout.”

NHS Employers announced that
Jeremy Hunt himself had officially
asked the head of the BMA’s
junior committee to return to the
negotiating table, and for that
reason the planned meetings were
postponed.

about for a while.
It was bit like the end of a house
party. People who lived far away
started to leave, and some bloke got
out an acoustic guitar and started
singing the unofficial junior doctor’s
anthem, to the tune of Jessie J’s
Price Tag.

protest for medics.
With nothing yet decided, the
doctors may go further. Although
the profession hasn’t taken industrial
action since the 1970s, medics are
warning that they may be forced to
strike. Another protest is planned
for the 17th
of October.
Jennie Watson told FELIX “This
isn’t about money, this is about
patient and doctors’ safety, but the
two are inextricably linked”.
