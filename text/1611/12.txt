Water flows on Mars, but is it habitable?
T
he strongest evidence yet
that liquid water flows
intermittently on the
present-day surface of
Mars has been provided by NASA’s
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
(MRO) this week.
Researchers studying mysterious
dark streaks which appear to flow
down steep slopes during the red
planet’s warmer seasons were able
to detect the signatures of hydrated
minerals using the MRO’s imaging
spectrometer.
The narrow, dark streaks were
previously believed to be caused by
a process involving liquid water.The
new findings, published in Nature
Geoscience, confirmed the presence
of perchlorate salts, known to lower
the freezing point of water.
“The detection of hydrated salts
on these slopes means that water
plays a vital role in the formation
of these streaks” said the paper’s
lead author Lujendra Ojha of the
Georgia Institute of Technology.
The scientists hypothesise a shallow
subsurface flow, leading some water
to rise to the surface and produce
the dark streaks.
Astronaut and associate
administrator of NASA’s Science
Mission Directorate John
Grunsfield stated that “This is
a significant development, as it
appears to confirm that water –
albeit briny – is flowing today on
the surface of Mars.
“Our quest on Mars has been to
‘follow the water’, in our search for
life in the universe,and now we have
convincing science that validates
what we’ve long suspected.”

“It seems that the more we study
Mars, the more we learn how life
could be supported and where there

Outbreak of drug-resistant ‘super gonorrhoea’
A
new highly drug-
resistant strain of
gonorrhoea has emerged
in the north of England,
leading health authorities have
warned.First detected last March in
Leeds, the infection has reportedly
spread as far as Macclesfield,
Oldham and Scunthorpe.
Some infected patients disclosed
that they had recently had sex with
people from other parts of England.
Sixteen cases have been confirmed
by Public Health England (PHE)
so far,all in heterosexual individuals.
Gonorrhoea is a sexually
transmitted bacterial infection
that can be passed on through
unprotected oral, vaginal and anal
sex. Many more people in the UK
could already be harboring the new
strain of bacteria, as patients do not
always experience symptoms.
Effective treatment of gonorrhoea
relies on two antibiotics taken
concurrently, one by injection
(ceftriaxone) and the other in tablet
form (azithromycin). The newly
discovered strain exhibits resistance
to azithromycin, according to PHE.
In a statement, the British
Association for Sexual Health
and HIV (BASHH) expressed
concerns that “the effectiveness of
current front-line dual therapy for
gonorrhoea will be threatened if this
resistant strain continues to spread
unchecked.”
If left untreated, gonorrhoea can
result in infertility and chronic pain.
People under the age of 25 are most
likely to be affected, with almost
35,000 cases reported in England
in 2014. Symptoms for both men
and women can include pain during
sex or while urinating and unusual
discharge.
Infection can be prevented by
always using condoms with new
partners. It is also advisable to get
regular sexual health checks; testing
for gonorrhoea is easy, painless and
available for free on the NHS.
This new outbreak coincides with
the launch of a new Imperial College
London campaign to combat
the rise of antibiotic resistance.
The Antimicrobial Resistance
Collaborative was launched by
Professor Dame Sally Davies, the
UK’s Chief Medical Officer, at an
event last week on Imperial’s South
Kensington campus.
“Drug-resistant infections are one
of the great health challenges of our
time.We need the best and brightest

minds from all academic disciplines
and all sectors to contribute to the
fight” said Dame Sally Davies.
“Working across disciplines to solve
global challenges,like drug-resistant
infections, is what [Imperial] does
best.”
Imperial College President
Professor Alice Gast warned that
the long-term consequence of
failure to tackle the issue of drug
resistance would be 10 million extra
worldwide deaths per year by 2050.
She called for doctors and scientists
to take action by accelerating the
hunt for new drugs.
“Our efforts to stem infectious
diseases are increasingly futile.
Bacteria are getting stronger,
while the illnesses they cause are
getting worse. London’s academics,
businesses, hospitals and charities
can help solve this great challenge
of our time.
“As medicine advances, we expect
to get healthier. But our faith in
medical progress is being turned on
its head. And we should have seen
it coming.” Professor Gast added:
“We’ve heard the warnings. Now’s
the time for action … to tackle this
great threat to humanity.”
