I had a great gap
year, but now it
burns when I pee.
If you have any actual symptoms,
best to get yourself checked.
As well as the classic urinary burn,
they can extend but aren’t limited
to: weird genital discharge, pain
when having sex, needing to piss
really urgently, out of the ordinary
periods or any new bumps around
your junk. Gross to read, but grosser
to have.
Look, it might be nothing, but
you could just get a free STI test to
put your mind at ease. It might be
something else, like a urinary tract
infection, which you’d want to get
sorted anyway.
You know when something’s
changed down there, so if all is not
quite how it should be, best get it
sorted.
But getting an
STI test is such a
massive effort.
You can book an STI test at
Imperial’s own health centre in
Prince’s Gardens or there are
walk-in clinics all over London if
you’re worried about bumping into
someone you know.
Tests for Chlamydia and
Gonorrhoea for lads just involve
pissing in a cup. You can do that,
can’t you?
Ladies, there is a little swabbing
involved, but you can usually do it
yourself,and it’s nothing particularly
out of the ordinary.
But I feel fine!
Loads of stuff can be symptomless.
If you’re at it all the time, we advise
getting checked every three months,
or between sexual partners.
Look, sleep with who you will;
we’re not about shaming, we’re just
about safety.
Some of this shit can make you
infertile, and although babies is
exactly what we’re all trying to
avoid right now, anything that has
consequences that dramatic has got
to be pretty grim.
LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX (NO, SERIOUSLY, LET’S TALK)
It was World Contraception Day last week, so we
thought we’d use that as an excuse to give you lot
the lowdown on sexual health. Plus it meant we
got to say sex a lot in the office (SEX) and share
gross stories about our “friends from home”.
No one
remembers
how weird
you were
in year
nine, and
damn, your
bedroom’s
just down
the hall!
S
oyou’reafresherembarking
on your first year away
from the homestead. Your
parents coming back early
can’t stop you now. Halls feels like
a giant school trip; the bubbling
sexual tension, lack of teachers
after dark and playful fights in the
communal kitchen when you should
be working. Except now there are
several hundred of you, no one
remembers how weird you were in
year nine,and damn,your bedroom’s
just down the hall!
All this might lead to you
bringing back your new bae for
Christmas, but unless you’re careful,
your first holiday home could bring
something decidedly itchier.
FELIX doesn’t slut shame and
we’re totally pro you enjoying your
sexual awakening in between lab
reports. However, if you’re a novice
in the contraception department,
that has got to change.

You might not be planning on
shagging your way through freshers’
week, but experience has taught
most of us that these things are
mysterious, and if they happen, it’s
often when you least expect them.
So be prepared, rubber up and take
note.
Whether your mum, slyly and
without mention, packed you
a Costco bulk box of condoms
when you left home, or you lost
your virginity at fourteen with an
exchange student, we still think you
might discover something new in
this spread.
You know you’re meant to use a
condom. We all know, but it cam be
a little more complex and confusing
than that.We’re not trying to scare
you,but ‘super gonorrhoea’is a thing
now.
Maybe you’ll have loads of sex,but
maybe you won’t and that’s okay. At
least after this you’ll be well armed
with contraceptive knowledge. All
this information works really well as
stilted small talk at freshers’ events.
At least it does for the medics.
Let’s start with the basics. Double
bagging is not a thing. Contrary to
Gavin and Stacey’s Smithy, using
two condoms at once is not a way
to give yourself double protection
against STIs. You go to Imperial,
and so probably know more about
friction than this ex-biologist. It’s a
great way to break them and make
yourself even more vulnerable to
disease/pregnancy/embarrassment
that you thought double bagging
was a thing.
Ok this one surprised even us, but
according to the NHS you shouldn’t
be using a condom for more than
half an hour. So if you’re getting it
on in anything nearing endurance,
best change it up part way through.
Better safe than sorry. This could
act as a nice snack/phone checking
break for your lover, which they will
undoubtedly be grateful for. Again,
it’s a friction issue. Hurry up with
that super-condom your lot are
working on, Bill Gates, jeez.
ONE AT
A TIME,
GUYS
THE ‘HALF
AN HOUR
RULE’
BEING ILL
FUCKS UP
THE PILL
Look, even if you’re on the pill,
having a stomach upset could nullify
its effect.If you throw up within two
hours of taking it, chances are you’re
probably not going to have absorbed
those lovely hormones. The NHS
recommends you take another one
straight away and that then you’ll
be okay. However, if diarrhoa or
vomiting continue for longer than
24 hours, you should assume that
the pill won’t have worked. If you
are going to have sex during this
bout of what sounds like a pretty
awful stomach bug, you’d better use
a condom.
I can’t believe anyone thinks this
is funny, or (god forbid) sexy, but
like, obviously don’t rip open the
condom wrapper with your teeth.
The poor thing is no match for your
sharp and beautifully maintained
by modern dentistry knashers. Also
don’t pin it to the noticeboard in
your room. It sounds ridiculous but
babies have definitely been born
because of this. Maybe you were?
Nice subject for your first phonecall
home, that.
RESPECT
THE
RUBBER
Grace Rahman
Editor-in-Chief
How much is all this
safe sex going to
cost me?
Nothing! God bless the NHS.
Contraception is free in the UK,
to everyone. Even if you’re an
international student, you are
entitled to free contraception and
sexual health checks.
We’re not saying you can waltz
into Boots and nab a box of Durex
without paying, but all methods
of contraception are free once
you’ve registered with a GP. The
contraceptive pill and everything.
Condoms can be picked up at the
Student Union and the Imperial
College Health Centre on Prince’s
Gardens, FOR FREE. Don’t be
embarrassed, just walk in and ask.
You’re a strong independent person
who requires some rubbers, well
done you, and if anyone in the
waiting room looks at you funny,
they’re probably just jealous.
If you’re really worried you could
probably just write it on a little note
and hand in to the receptionist. But
come on now, we’re all grown ups.
Condoms are a
pain.
Do they actually hurt? If you
genuinely think they’re too small,
there’s a site called TheyFit who
measure your member and ship
specially made rubbers. They also
have a money back guarantee if
you’re not happy.
There is literally NO EXCUSE.
FELIX is certainly not judging
you for how you choose to get your
kicks, but use a freaking condom.
All this talk of
condoms, are you
lot sponsored by
Durex? What are the
alternatives?
Much to our editor’s
disaapointment, we are not yet
sponsored by Durex, but no,
condoms aren’t the be all and end all
of contraception. There are myriad
other methods for ladies and gents
to prevent pregnancy. The obvious
one is the pill.To get it you will have
to see a doctor. They weigh you,
check your blood pressure and ask
a few questions just to make sure it
suits you.Then they give you a three
month prescription to see how you
fair.
After that you go back, and they’ll
give you as many as you want. This
being said, condoms are the only
form of contraception that protect
you from STIs.
We’re not
trying to scare
you, but ‘super
gonorrhoea’ is
a thing now
We’re not
saying you
can waltz
into Boots
and nab a
box of Durex

paying

For urgent care, e.g. if you think
you’ve had unprotected sex with
someone with HIV, you may
need to be put on emergency
medication. You can go to A&E
for this. If you’ve had unprotected
sex within the last 72 hours
and want to take the morning
after pill, you can get it at most
pharmacies, and Boots offers an
online ordering service.
