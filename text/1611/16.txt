The Weekend
Here at FELIX,our week normally
starts on a Saturday.This is when the
editors start thinking about sending
emails to each section’s mailing
list or posting on their respective
Facebook groups, requesting article
submissions from the writers.
Some editors will already have a
bank of story ideas for the coming
issue and will offer these up for
anyone to take a punt at writing;
others might just ask you to pitch
your own piece. Content can be
submitted to any section editor
at any time, but this is when the
majority of ideas get discussed.
FELIX Arts will have already
sent students out to shows and
exhibitions for reviews, while sports
teams write up their match reports
as soon as they finish celebrating
(or commiserating). Science will
be eyeing up the latest discoveries,
Food will be cooking up ideas and
Hangman thinks about crawling
out of his dungeon to predict your
future for the next week.
Writers can come down to the
office in the west basement of Beit
Quad and use our shiny shiny Macs,
or work from home – whatever
environment you prefer to get stuff
done in. There’s usually a couple of
us in the office. Section editors will
usually set their own deadlines for
submissions, so just ask them when
they need an article finished by.
Monday
Our glorious leader – Editor-
in-Chief Grace Rahman – starts
drawing up the pagination
spreadsheet, asking each section’s
editors to confirm how many
pages they’d like to fill that week.
She figures out how much ad
space we’ve sold and makes sure
someone’s organising a (tasteful)
nude photoshoot of a club, society
or project for the Centrefold.
We’ve got 40 pages to fill and by
now the content is flooding in to
the section editors. Big pieces for
the Features and News sections are
being researched and lots of coffee
is consumed. At this point we still
have no idea what will be on the
front page.
Tuesday
Section editors will usually set
their final submission deadline
for Monday or Tuesday at the
latest, so they can get down to the
basement and start laying out. We
use software called InDesign to put
the paper together, working from
templates to make sure each section
has a common look.
Around 900 words fill a page
of FELIX – 450 for half a page –
but often content comes in a little
over so the editors will have to play
around with the scissors and make
sure everything fits. Editors will
find photographs and graphics to
go with each piece and come up
with headlines as they go.
Wednesday
One by one, sections are laid out
and ticked off ready for the final
copy and layout edit. The News
team will have a few articles ready
to go, but more news is always
breaking – if we’re half a page
short at this point we can almost
guarantee something will happen
tomorrow to fill the space.
Adverts and Centrefolds are sent
in by today and Hangman coughs
up some witty satire. Puzzles puts
together a page or two of sudoku,
slitherlink or crossword puzzles
to entertain you between lectures.
The office is always buzzing on
a Wednesday as everyone starts
worrying about tomorrow’s print
deadline.
Thursday
Panic stations! Our crack team
of copy and layout editors take the
reins, working through the entire
paper again making sure everyone
successfully dotted their ‘I’s and
crossed their ‘T’s. Most of the
problems at this stage are simple
tweaks to improve the paper’s
design and readability.
Sometimes, however, things get
stressful on Thursdays – we might
find that a section promised more
pages of content than they actually
put together, forcing us to write
something quickly to fill the space.
Conversely, we might also need to
bump some excess content to next
week’s issue.
We scramble to finish the News
stories and design the front page.
Grace writes an editorial piece,
commenting on the events of the
week or something of interest
featured in another part of the
paper. Finally the whole issue is
finished and ready to send over to
the print company. We celebrate!
Friday
Deeply hungover, a few of us drag
our sorry selves back to Beit Quad
early(ish) in the morning to see the
fruits of our efforts; overnight a van
has delivered a giant pile of fresh-
off-the-print newspapers. We load
up the trolley and get distributing
thousands of copies of FELIX all
over the South Kensington campus.
A few bundles of papers are taken
to the internal post office to be sent
to Imperial’s campuses in St Mary’s,
Charing Cross, White City and
Hammersmith. Finally we reserve
some copies to send to the British
Library for archiving, and a bundle
to have bound in giant leather books
for those of us who want a memento
of our time here.
After distribution we grab some
food – cheeky Nando’s or maybe
a liquid lunch in FiveSixEight –
and breathe a sigh of relief. Then
members of the Web team come in
and make sure every article in the
paper gets posted on felixonline.
co.uk for those of you who don’t like
getting inky fingers.
And then, of course, the cycle
repeats! We publish every Friday
during term time except in the
last week, as well as putting bonus
content online throughout the year.
We have many leather-bound books and our office smells of rich mahogany. Photo Credit: Cem Hurrell

Make friends and influence people at FELIX
Read all about it – a week in the life of Imperial’s student newspaper society!
So that’s it folks – a week in the
life of your student newspaper.
Hopefully I’ve convinced you that
there’s tonnes of ways for you to be
involved in FELIX. We’re currently
recruiting for photographers, web
editors, programmers, copy and
layout editors, illustrators and (of
course) writers. If you’re really keen,
you also have the opportunity to
take over as Section Editor this year
for Puzzles, Technology, Games,
Fashion, Television, Books, Food or
Science.
You can submit content for any
section of the paper. Many people
work on several – personally in the
last year I’ve written for Comment,
Features, Science and Film on top
of editing the News section; just
in this issue you’ll see me in News,
Science, Food and here in Clubs
and Socs.
I started out after Freshers’Fair last
year as a copy editor and fell in love
with the office atmosphere, quickly
learning how to use InDesign and
Photoshop to help edit layout too.
By the end of second term I was a
Section Editor and elected Vice
Chair of the society. As you can see,
FELIX will take up as little or as
much of your time as you’ll allow it.
I urge you to get involved – some of
the best people at Imperial are.
