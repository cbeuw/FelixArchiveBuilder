COMMENT
A word of advice from one Imperial graduate
The Angry Grad
Columnist
G
o to a world ­
class
institution they said.
You’ll be hyper­
employable, they said.
Well here I am, three years on with
a bang tidy degree from Imperial
College London.
Now, the ickle little freshers
amongst you might be feverishly
reading my words at this point,
looking up to me; an Imperial
survivor (squeals excitedly as if
Harry Styles himself just tweeted
back).
As a graduate, what exciting
adventures am I embarking on
currently? Raking in dollar like
the banker wanker Imperial wants
us to be (obvsiously for alumni
contributions). Cotching in Sierra
Leone,battling the Ebola epidemic?
Well actually, avid readers, I’m
currently rolling around on my
parents’ couch in urban Berkshire,
feeding on my mother’s (perfectly
round) chapattis and writing for my
old student newspaper. That’s right
kids,I’m unemployed (and Asian,so
double whammy there but at least
I’m defying stereotypes).
Thus, this is my probably-not-
very-weekly column on the world
of graduate bliss. Willkommen my
pretties, to the life of the angry
grad. Seeing as it’s freshers’ (woops,
fist pumps, claps chaotically like a
slippery seal), this column is about
what to expect from freshers’ week;­
what to do,what not to do and what
I would do differently. Trust me
kids, take my advice, I’ve turned out
great (if in doubt, refer to the intro
above... I mean, I get my washing
done for me, be envious).
First and foremost, be excited!
You’ve left the nest (for now),
hurrah! Genuinely, congratulations
on getting here. It is an achievement,
and don’t let those Oxbridge
rejections get you down! If you are
feeling bitter,just remember: at least
you’re not at UCL, with all their
fit arts students and University of
London benefits.
Anyway, freshers’ is truly the time
to go big or go home. Come out of
your shell, be spontaneous, and if
you hate the morons/friends you’ve
made in a couple of weeks, not a
problem! Getting an upgrade is
bloody easy; if Eleanor’s jodhpurs
and shocking horsey tales are
getting on your tits, tell her you love
a ready meal “beef” lasagne and you
won’t even recognise her two years
on. I mean, be ruthless.

Secondly, turn down your bloody
expectations of what University
entails. You’re at Imperial for god’s
sake, not Loughborough/Leeds
Met/anywhere with more than one
good looking bloke within a 10
mile radius. We have a reputation
of nerdsdom to live up to! You
will most likely not be going out
five times a week or grinding on a
chirpsing second year in the erotic
ego­
boosting steam room that is any
central London club. You live in
London now, you will be broke.
Yes, you might spend your money
on alcohol over food because you’re
a studentLAD and yes, Wasabi will
steal all your sterling. For you new
to London cuties, Wasabi is an evil
temptress, enticing you with her
perfectly salty and starchy sushi
or curry delicacies. While she may
make the voices in your head stop
throwing around anti­
psychotic drug
names (which ironically, you will
probably rather need than study) for
twenty minutes, she will also make
you crash into a worthwhile food
coma.
So yeah, you can’t spend six quid
on a tofu curry and another twenty
in Soho’s finest discotheques every
night (plus a bloated stomach is
never attractive in body con, gurl, so
really, Wasabi saves your liver). The
overdraft struggle is real my friend.
If you can afford to party that hard,
you’re probably either a) spending
your nights in Metric,which is never
cool, or b) the child of a sheikh. I
despise you Sheikh spawn, you,
with your super snazzy multimillion
pound South Kensington flat, and
your mind­
blowing ability to make
shisha look cool.
Lastly, get involved. Join clubs and
societies, (write for FELIX, please).
They’re the perfect place to expand
your Facebook friend count and get
away from your course mates. That’s
my biggest regret, not involving
myself in clubs and societies
properly. You see those netball girls
wearing those tiny nurse’s costumes
at Drs and Nurses club nights, who
you judge from the bottom of your
heart? You could be one of them!
You probably weren’t that cool
at school, but at Imperial, we have
different standards. You CAN be
a plastic or a jock, because, well,
IMPERIAL, YO.
Welcome to Imperial, you fools. Our resident anonymous
graduate columnist is only slightly bitter...
