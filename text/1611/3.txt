Times rankings put Imperial eighth globally
T
he Times Higher
Education (THE) World
University Rankings
2015/16 were revealed
this week, with Imperial College
London gaining one place from last
year. Four of London’s universities
were ranked in the top 30.
Imperial took eighth position
this year, with University College
London in 14th
, the London School
of Economics 23rd
and King’s
College London 27th
.
Mayor of London Boris Johnson
said that he was “incredibly proud”
of the capital’s performance in the
rankings: “The capital continues to
be the global leader in education,
innovating and inspiring top talent
from both across the country and
overseas.”
Other top UK universities
included the University of Oxford,
in second place, and the University
of Cambridge in fourth.
Topping the table was the
California Institute of Technology
for the fifth consecutive year. A
total of 78 UK universities made the
top 800, second only to the United
States. Editor of the THE rankings
Phil Baty described the UK as a
“stand-out performer”.
“However, despite the UK’s
success, its continued cuts in higher
education funding … and series of
immigration measures affecting
overseas students, will hinder its
performance in the long run”. He
continued: “The UK will have to
work hard to ensure [these] do
not hinder its place in the World
University Rankings”.
Jo Johnson, Minister for
Universities and Science, did his
best to assuage these concerns:
“These rankings confirm the world-
class standing of our education
sector.
“Our reforms will ensure our
universities continue to compete
with the very best internationally
and deliver high-quality teaching to
students at home”

Imperial’s University Challenge team
through to second round
A
team of students from
Imperial College
London has made it
throughthefirstroundof
popular BBC quiz show University
Challenge this month. They will
face a new team in the second round
of the knockout tournament on
Monday 2nd
November.
Headed up by last year’s FELIX
Science Editor James Bezer, a third
year student of the Department
of Physics, the team also features
postgrad Onur Teymur, who is
working on his PhD in statistics,
fourth-year physicist Ashwin
Braude and Ben Fernando, also a
third-year physics undergrad.
They were featured in the tenth
episode of the 2015/16 series,which
aired on the 14th
of September.
Imperial thrashed the University of
Reading team with a current series
high score of 285 to 110.
Performing strongly on the
range of science and mathematical
questions, the team earned
a rare “well done” from host
Jeremy Paxman after successfully
completing a starter round on
planetary astronomy. However they
flopped the second picture round,
not recognising Salma Hayek’s
portrayal of artist Frida Kahlo.
Seriously guys, Kate Winslet?
Imperial last won the show back
in 2001, also coming runners-up
one year later. This is the first team
to make it onto the televised portion
of the series since 2012/13, when
we were eliminated in the quarter-
finals. Over 100 students took
