W
elcome to Imperial.
For whatever
reason, your life
choices have led
you here, and you now stand on
the precipice of higher education.
Hooray for you.
Whether you’re here to study
science, science, science that isn’t
actually science or medicine, this is
where you’ll be spending the next
three/four/six/several years.
No doubt you’ve picked up this
issue looking for a glimpse into
what awaits. That was your first
mistake.
Hangman has been reading a
lot of articles with titles like “Top
Tips for Freshers’ Week” and “36
mistakes every Fresher will make”
recently.
It’s been a long summer.
The upside of this for you is that
we’ve picked up a few things from
our reading that we thought were
worth passing on.
Nobody cares what you did at A
Level.
Seriously. Nobody cares. It’s
great that you did some. Now you
are here, and A Levels are history.
Nobody cares about history except
history students, and we don’t have
those at Imperial. For good reasons.
Nobody cares what you did on your
gap year.
They really don’t.They care so little,
in fact, that we’re not even going to
justify this claim any further.
Nobody cares that you didn’t do a
gap year.
You didn’t do a gap year?
Congratulations. Now shut up.
Nobody cares about Oxbridge.
We know, you applied to that
College at Cambridge/Oxford/
whatever. Yes, we’re sure it was
really nice and just the perfect place
for you to learn. We all failed at
getting into Oxbridge too, so stop
loudly protesting the injustice of it
all. Because you’re not there. You’re
at Imperial. We’re better, anyway.
Freshers’ Fair is good for one thing
and one thing only.
Freebies.
There is only one way to endure
the unending awkwardness of the
Mingle.
But we thought we’d just leave
this space blank to represent said
unending awkwardness.
Or something.
(See picture)
Something something triangles.
If you spend any time near the
Union, you’ll notice an abundance
of triangles being used for
marketing and such. There is a
reason for this, but no-one knows
what it is. Something to do with the
Illuminati, if you ask Hangman.
Use a condom.
We’re actually being serious here.
This is the only time that
Hangman will ever be serious
during your entire stay at Imperial,
so you’d better listen up.
USE A CONDOM (or equivalent
method of protection*).That is all.
*Pulling out is not an equivalent
method of protection. Anyone who
says or thinks otherwise is an idiot
and should not be getting any.
At this point, we would put
something about how we hope you
find these Top Tips (But Just the
Tips)TM
useful, but honestly we
don’t care.
Do what you want.
Just beware the Hangman.

This week you believe that
your long distance relationship
with your girlfriend/boyfriend
from home will last because
you are an idiot. After taking
a miserable National Express
coach to go see them, you
discover they have left you for
a Brazilian god/goddess.

This week you are the
horoscopes writer. You start
the year by trying to sneak
an unprintable horoscope in,
thinking Hangman won’t be
paying attention.
You are wrong. Hangman is
always paying attention.
This week you desperately
name-drop brand names left
and right in the vain hope
they’ll send some money or
other free goodies your way.
Hangman is sponsored this
week by Wonga, The Daily
Mail, and GoPro.
This week the crippling
loneliness felt during freshers
week causes you to have a
promiscuous rendezvous with
a Sainsbury’s basics chicken
breast. Unfortunately your
roommate takes a Go­Pro video
of you and instantly everyone
calls you chicken fucker.
Succinct at least.
This week in your Halls
someone has left some chicken
breast in the fridge that you
can use, and despite from
a slightly strange odour, it
tastes quite good fried with
a little garlic butter. The day
afterwards you unfortunately
develop mouth herpes.
This week you discover to
your horror that your mum
packed some baby photos
in your luggage and after a
drunken Freshers party, your
new friends discover this and
purloin them. The next day
you are awoken to the sight of
a photo of 5 year old you in the
bath emblazoned around your
halls.
This week, after your lads’
holiday to Malaga you receive
a friend request from Manuela,
your 46 year old one night
stand. She is pregnant with
triplets and is demanding that
you marry her. At least if she
comes to halls, she won’t have
an ID card to get in.
This week after discovering
that all students in the School
of Medicine receive a free
iPad, you go to the head of the
school and remove his plastic
mask in a Scooby-­Doo like
fashion only to discover it was
in fact Oprah that has been
running ICSM this whole time.
This week after a Summer
of being a #Corbynite,
you discover that you are
beginning to grow a grey beard
and you keep finding black
caps in your house after you
wake up. You realize you really
do have Corbyn fever and the
Daily Mail was right!
This week after arriving at
Imperial you decide to go
to one of the local clubs as
you assume it can’t be that
expensive and you might as
well whilst you’re in South
Kensington. The morning after
you sell your kidney to Wonga
to be able to eat.
This week you have this awful
nightmare that Imperial
has placed you in a Halls of
residence that’s five miles
away from the main campus.­
You then wake up and realize
you’re in Woodward.­
At least you’re not in Xenia.
This week you realize that
perhaps having sex with your
Hall Senior was probably a
mistake, as it appears that they
were a 47 year old ost doc who
probably should have learnt to
live like an adult sooner. This
makes Freshers’ Mingle very
awkward.
