Four of London’s top music venues to try
L
ondon is home to some
of the greatest music
venues in the country with
heavyweights such as O2
Academy Brixton, the Roundhouse
and Alexandra Palace playing host
to the biggest names in music.
As artists shift away from
making their money on album
and single sales, live music has
become more expensive than
ever. A ticket for a mid­
range gig
(which usually lasts only a few
hours) now often exceeds £30.
With this in mind, we’ve
compiled a list of some of our
favourite (relatively) cheap music
venues that offer not only great live
music but great club nights too.
The Lexington’s downstairs
lounge is a modern­
-day hipster’s
dream,offeringamassiveselectionof
American microbrews and whiskeys
whilst hosting the Rough Trade
Shop pop quiz every Monday.
Upstairs, you’ll find one of
London’s best small and intimate
venues where an impressive line­
up of alternative pop and rock
artists will drown you in sound.
Recent acts include dark wave
newbie Petite Noir and Japanese
acid­punkfour-pieceBoNingenwith
Seattle punk group Chastity Belt
taking the stage later this month.
White Heat is the venue’s
popular Friday club night (from
11pm­
-4am) playing the finest in
left­
field pop and house. (Angel,
club nights £5, live music ~£10.)
If you’re feeling adventurous
head down to Banquet Records
in Kingston. Frequent in-store live
shows where bands squeeze into
the stores tiny interior bundled
with the latest releases (a pairing
that has also found success at
Rough Trade East and West).
The popular indie club night
New Slang each Thursday is a must,
hosting massive DJ sets from the
biggest names in electronic music
such as Jamie xx and Disclosure.
To top it off, you can catch store-
organised gigs during the week
at The Hippodrome with both
Foals and Bring Me The Horizon
playing in the coming months.
If you’re a fan of indie, punk
or metal it’s well worth making
the trip to experience Banquet
Records exhaustive live music line-
up. (Kingston upon Thames, New
Slang and live music ~£10.)
Situated in Shoreditch in a
renovated warehouse, Village
Underground describes itself as a
non­
profit art space and it’s easily
one of the East End’s hippest venues
(they even have their own zine).
From afar, the venue is instantly
noticeable thanks to the tube
carriages perched atop its street­
art covered walls. The cavernous
interior’s fantastic acoustics help
deliversomeofthebestexperimental
club­
nights in the capital.
From now until December,
the venue is one of many hosting
Clock Strikes 13 – a series of nights
focusing on the future of electronic
music – evenings from labels XL and
Hyperdub are not to be missed.
Expect an abundance of finely
sculptured beards and moustaches
and not to be able to afford
any of the drinks. (Shoreditch

High Street, from ~£10.)
Easily one of London’s best clubs,
XOYO in Shoreditch is well known
for its excellent residency series
bringing some of world’s best DJs
to the capital (Busy P,who managed
Daft Punk, is in residence from
now until the end of the year).
Split across two floors, the venue
was refurbished in 2013 and it
now boasts one of the best lighting
and sound systems in town.
Student club night Sneak on
Tuesdays is always a rave, delivering
the best in house, tech and bass –
just make sure to get there early
to avoid the massive queues.
Regular live events are also
available with electronic post­
rockers Vessels playing in the
coming weeks. (Old Street, student
club night £3, live music ~£14.)
