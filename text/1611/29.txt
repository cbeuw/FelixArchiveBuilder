FUCWIT BOARD
Slitherlink
How to play
Slitherlink is a bit like the puzzle love child of Mindsweeper and Sudoku.
The object is to draw lines between the dots to create one long and importantly,
looping line. it shouldn’t start or finish, it should be like an elastic band. Each
number indicates how many lines should be drawn around it.
Cells which don’t contain a number can be surrounded by any number of lines. The
line must form a loop,so no branching.Squares aren’t allowed either.There are never
cells containing the number 4. Not in Slitherlink. Oh no.
The best place to start is usually by drawing crosses around the few zeros on a
Slitherlink grid.These crosses indicate that you can’t have a line there.
Points available this week:
