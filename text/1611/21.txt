C
ongratulations! Welcome
to Imperial and the next
three to six years of your
life! What were you thinking?
Of course we’re all looking forward
to not having to spend time with
humanities students, but let’s face
it – we’re sitting in the epicentre of
global arts and culture, so let’s make
the most of it!
If you’re like the three of us and
have nothing better to do with your
time, you’ve already made a list of
all the galleries, plays and stand-ups
you want to see.
But London isn’t cheap and if we
went to see everything we wanted,
we’d be a couple of grand out of
pocket. Wouldn’t it be great to see
all these wonderful things for free,
and not just now but throughout
your course?
Before you ask: no, it doesn’t
involve any nefarious cult-like
ceremonies or deals with the devil.
We,the wonderful people at FELIX
Arts, can get you the tickets for
almost any new London show and
all we ask in exchange is 400 words
of your most scathing opinions
– no previous writing experience
necessary!
If you’re worried you’re not a
good enough writer, or that you
won’t know what to say, stop right
there. The three of us will guide
you through the process and we
promise, every review you write gets
easier than the last one.

Arts Editors
This year’s FELIX Arts editors welcome you to the London art scene
Don’t be put off, we’re lovely
people, honest! Besides getting to
see the shows on press night – often
weeks before anyone else, in some
of the best seats, for free – the more
delightful venues often like to throw
free booze at you and many offer a
second free ticket!
Of course they are hoping you’ll
be nice to them, but with your livers
hardened by freshers’ week, your
journalistic integrity is unlikely to
be challenged.
Tl;dr: if you like art, free things
and alcohol, come write for FELIX
Arts!
If for now you just want to enjoy
reading our awesome Arts section,
you can check out our favourite
upcoming shows and our guide to
London’s best cheap venues.
In the upcoming weeks we’ll be
introducing our brand new poetry
and comedy sections.We also have a
bunch of arty events in the pipeline
and a number of features and
interviews with London’s art scene.
Later on this term we’ll be
publishing Phoenix, the Imperial
Arts magazine and we’ll need lots
of you artists, photographers, short
story writers and poets to submit
your work.
This is all in addition to our regular
content of reviews and hard hitting
comment pieces as the culture bible
of Exhibition Road.
If you’d like to get involved but are
unsure what with,or if you just want
to put faces to the words,drop by the
FELIX office in the West Basement
of Beit Quad or drop us an email
on arts.felix@imperial.ac.uk. We’d be
delighted to meet you!
We’re
sitting in the
epicentre of
global arts
and culture,
so let’s
make the
most of it
