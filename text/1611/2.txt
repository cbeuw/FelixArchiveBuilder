ello and welcome to
this, the very first
FELIX of the year.
And thanks for taking
the time to read my editorial, you
sweet angel.
Congrats for getting this far! You
all deserve a pat on the back for
getting into Imperial. You deserve a
little sit down for moving all your
stuff into halls.By the end of freshers
week, you’ll need a beach holiday.
But for now, it’s time to forget your
A-Level results, unfollow all your
school friends on Facebook and
think of a new nickname. Good
luck to you.
Freshers’ week, man, what a time.
It’s awful and great and terrifying,
but you don’t need me to tell you
that. I wish you the best of luck
– with your studies, with your
communal kitchens and with your
first load of washing. Don’t tumble
dry wool. You’re welcome, friends.
But who am I to tell you how to
wash your clothes? Well no one
really – I’ve shrunk loads of washing
in my time, but I’m just the Editor
of your weekly student newspaper.
Like the Union President, or any
of her deputies (who you may well
have already Facebook stalked) I am
a sabbatical officer. We all get paid
to take a year out of our studies and

run something. Don’t ask me what
the others are here for, but I do the
newspaper.
It’s a big old job, which needs
a big team behind it. This means
that there’s plenty of room for
you. We’re always after illustrators,
photographers, writers and other
cuties to get involved. You can read
more about what we get up to in
Clubs and Societies on page 19. We
have a good time.
Stop me if you see me around the
place. Please. Most of my friends
have graduated and have proper jobs
so I have no one to eat lunch with.
If you spot me wondering around
Imperial, come and introduce
yourself! Don’t be scared. Much like
a spider, I am more frightened of
you than you are of me.
I hope you enjoy this issue.FELIX
went to the big med student protest
this week, we’ve got a lot of bolshy
opinion pieces, and there’s a big
feature on sex and your health. That
last one is a personal obsession of
mine. Other people are passionate
about Star Wars or The Great British
Bake Off, but I love contraception (I
really love all three of these things
but contraception probably comes
out top).
Have you left your room yet?
Don’t. Read on. Someone will
probably knock in a minute. Until
then amuse yourself with news,
culture, recipes, sport and some
nudity in the form of our ancient
centrefold tradition (flick to the
middle you perv).
Don’t be a stranger. Let me know
if there’s anything you think we
should be reporting, and come say
hi if you want to get involved, no
experience necessary. You’re reading
this, which tells me you can read
and are already vastly overqualified.
Our brand spanking new office is
in the West Basement of Beit (by
the union) or you can email me at
felix@imperial.ac.uk. Finally, have a
lovely week, and if you get to the
puzzles and no one’s knocked on
your door yet, you should probably
go outside and introduce yourself.
