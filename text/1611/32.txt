hen did you last
really test yourself,
your mind or your
body to its limit
and experience something you’ve
only ever heard about, or watched
on YouTube? For example, have you
ever wondered what it feels like to
fall through a cloud at 150mph, or
use the sky as your playground?
IC Skydiving, Imperial’s most
adrenaline-fuelled extreme sports
club is here to give you that
opportunity! We can help you with
everything, from charity jumps
to getting a full skydiving license

Ice Hockey is without a doubt
one of the most exciting games in
the world. With speedy skaters,
powerful shots, fearless goalies, and
big hits, the intensity and pace of
the game is unrivalled by any other
sport. Last year had many great
moments for the Imperial Devils,
including a fantastic performance
at nationals in April, and attending
an international tournament in
the Netherlands. Now, after a long
summer of rest and preparation,
the Devils are looking forward to
another fierce season. Both the A
and B teams are ready to build on
last year’s successes and work harder
than ever before.
If you’re interested in trying
ice hockey at Imperial, everyone,
from seasoned skaters to complete
beginners, is welcome to get
involved. Since we provide sticks,
full kits and transport to the rink,

required!). We have experience
in every discipline, from canopy
formation to acrobatic wingsuiting,
and can guide you from zero to hero.
We had an incredible year last
year, obtaining two brand-new club
parachutes, year-round jumping,
foreign tours (2015 saw a crazy week
in the idyllic Portuguese Algarve)
and a new competition Formation
Skydiving team.
If you aren’t sure about skydiving,
we run frequent vertical wind tunnel
trips, so you can experience freefall
while hovering only a few feet off
the ground! Plus with newly formed
relationships with other unis and
skydivers, our social scene has never
been better. You don’t have to be a
skydiver to join IC Skydiving, and
who knows, you might just get
hooked.
