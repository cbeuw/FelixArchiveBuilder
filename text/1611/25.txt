FELIX Film presents:
The A-Z of Being a Film Snob
S
o, you’ve packed your bags with colour-coded stationary, set off from your hometown, and are finally about to get rid of that unfortunate nickname that plagued you through secondary
school. However, as any of the biologists can tell you, in order to survive the jungle that is the university food chain, you need to find your ecological niche. Maybe a #unilad? Only if you
want to spend the next three years necking snakebite with a group of fucking wankers named ‘Jonno’.High flyer? Unless you’re prepared to lock yourself in your room and risk a breakdown
before freshers’week has even finished, you should just aim for a 2:1. Luckily for you, the role of ‘corridor film snob’is easy to fill. We’ve even provided you with a guide, so tear down that
Star Wars poster, sit down, and pay attention.
Almodóvar,
Pedro:
Remember, accent at the end.
It’s Almo-DO-var, you fucking
uncultured cretins.
Bergman,
Ingmar:
‘Yeah, it really reminded me of
Persona’. Never explain how.
Critics:
Remember, film critics all know
nothing, unless they validate your
own opinion. Complain about the
rating system. Say that you can’t
place a number on art. Secretly
attend everything The Guardian
gives five stars to.
Dubbing:
Give me original language or give
me death. Placing chopsticks into
your ears would be preferable to
seeing a dubbed French film for you.
Eating in the
cinema:
God, just die already.
Fight Club:
FYI – It’s not a ‘Cult Film’ if
everyone’s fucking seen it.
Genres:
Dilettantes of cinema seem to
think there are a set number of
genres: comedy, drama, romance,
action etc. But you know better. As
anyone who’s read a music review
on Pitchfork knows, the best way to
seem to know what you’re talking
about is to be as unintelligible as
possible, and this is where obscure
film genres come in. Wikipedia has
a list of about 200 different ones, so
there’s no excuse for not being able
to tell your Metacinema from your
Mumblecore
Hype:
What kind of person comes to
mind when you think of the word
cool? Wearing lots of black? Most
definitely. Sunglasses on indoors?
Perhaps. Excited about anything?
No fucking way. Remember that
hype is the devil trying to get you
to look like a nark, and never reveal
just how fucking pumped you are
about the new Star Wars.
Image-Maker:
Using terms like director and
filmmaker are so trite nowadays,
and the time when you could refer
to Hitchcock as an ‘artist’ is long
gone. Now, in order to be hip, you’ve
gotta use terms like ‘Image-Maker’,
or perhaps ‘Image-Creator’ when
describing your favourite auteurs.
Judging
others:
Yeah, you’ll be doing this a lot…
Kickstarter:
Crowdfunding used to be a
nice little niche industry; a way
for creative people, who wouldn’t
otherwise have the resources, to
achieve their vision.
But then Zach Braff (net worth:
$22 million) convinced nearly
50,000 idiots to fund his next pet
project, Wish I Was Here, a critical
and commercial disaster. We don’t
talk about crowdfunding anymore.
Lynchian, use
of:
While technically meaning a
balance of the mundane and the
macabre, as found in Lynch’s work,
use it to describe any film that
fulfils any of the following criteria:
is bleak; has a weird soundtrack;
features a dream sequence; features
a dance sequence; is in black and
white; you find it confusing and
you don’t know why. When you’re
constructing an opinion of a film,
substitute in for every third word
and you’re in business.
Mainstream
cinema,
boycott of:
‘You guys are off on a hall trip
to see the new Hunger Games at
Imperial Cinema? Ah, I wish I
was free, but I’m going to see an
experimental art film from the 60s
of a man in a relationship with a
cheesegrater. It’s all about Vietnam.
Obviously.’
Names,
pronunciation
of:
Remember, the harder a film/
director’s name is to pronounce, the
better it sounds. Prime example:
Koyaanisqatsi.
Originals vs
Remakes:
Similar to the dubbing idea. The
newer film may have a bigger budget,
better actors, a more coherent
script, and special effects that don’t
look like a child’s Christmas play,
but for you the original is always
better. Complain about the remake
endlessly. Never go and see it.
Fight Club:
You can’t call
it a ‘Cult Film’
if everyone’s
fucking seen
it...
Posters:
A chance to put some of your
personality on your bedroom wall. 1
point for a foreign film. 2 points for
a foreign film poster in a different
language. 3 points for anything
Polish – that shit cray.
Questions:
‘What kind of movies do you
like?’, the biochemist on your floor
asks at the hall social. ‘I prefer to
look at cinema in terms of directors’,
you reply. It’s over. You win. You
have won Cinema.
Realism:
Basically,in order to really impress
people you need to par down your
interests into two main camps:
disturbingly depressing realism, and
depressingly disturbing fantasy. You
can either watch Olivia Colman
being urinated on in graphic detail
in Tyrannosaur, or John Nance
cutting open a mutated foetus in
Eraserhead. As long as you’re sure
you won’t get any sleep that night
you’re in business.
Sundance
Festival:
Everyone says that Sundance is the
new Cannes, but we all know that
really TIFF is the new Sundance,
Berlin is the new Telluride, and
anyone who’s anyone heads to
Locarno come August. What were
we talking about again?
Time:
The best films are all either 75
minutes long,or 5 hours.Everything
else is shit. Make your opinion on
this well known by loudly espousing
it in the hall kitchen at 2am .
Underground:
Underground cinema is good.
Underground cinemas are better.
Watching underground cinema in
an underground cinema is best.
VHS:
As vinyl records are to music twats,
VHS cassettes are to film snobs.
Widescreen:
As aspect ratios get larger and
larger,it’s only a matter of time until
films are beamed directly onto our
eyeballs. Make your opinion on this
travesty known by refusing to watch
anything that’s not in 4:3 ratio.
X-Rated:
Now you’ve escaped the
awkwardness of watching nude
scenes with your parents, you’re free
to watch as many R-rated films as
you want. Just remember – if there’s
no explanation for the nudity, it’s
art.
Lynchian: Use it to describe
any film that has a weird
soundtrack, features a dream
sequence, features a dance
sequence, is in black and
white, or you find confusing.
Y
chromosome:
Absolutely necessary to become a
successful film director, apparently.
In the BFI’s latest poll of film critics,
out of the top 250 films, only seven
were directed by women, and this
inequality seems to span the whole
industry. Show off your feminist
chops with ready references to
Agnes Varda, Chantal Akerman,
and Joanna Hogg.
Zero:
The number of friends you will
have if you follow this guide. Film
snobs are awful people, everyone
knows that. But at least you have
your Criterion Kurosawa Collection
to keep you warm at night.
The harder a
film/director’s
name is to
pronounce,
the better it
sounds in
conversation.
Example:
Koyaanisqatsi.

Hype is the
devil trying
to get you
to look like a
nark; never
reveal just
how pumped
you are about
the new Star
Wars.
