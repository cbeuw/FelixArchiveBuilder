W
elcome to Imperial!
I’m sure you’re
enjoying your
newfound freedom
as freshers, and are looking forward
to making lots of new memories and
friends. The first few weeks at uni
are some of the most exciting and
fun, because everything is still so
new and fresh. But on arrival, things
can also feel overwhelming,and very
different to what you are used to.
Being faced with a sea of new
people and having to interact with
them, trying to find friends and
make memories and join all the
interesting clubs and societies, can
start to feel like a lot of pressure. I
know that when I first came to uni
I started out excited, but ended up
feeling a little overwhelmed by all
the things I could do and people I
could meet.
Imperial seemed so large and
everyone seemed like they had
already established friendships
and activities, and I felt like a tiny,
unnoticeable and awkward fish in
this enormous pond. Home and all
the things that were familiar to me
seemed very far away.
Given that I also often find it
hard to talk to new people, being
convinced I will make a total fool of
myself and cause them to ostracise
me forever,I ended up mostly staying
in my room and only venturing out
to a couple of freshers’ events. They
were enjoyable, but sometimes left
me feeling as if I hadn’t managed to
connect with anybody properly.
However, after a few weeks when
I sorted out which clubs were to be
my regular commitments, I was able
to find a core group of friends who
shared my interests. I also made a
few good friends on my course who
I am still in contact with today.
To deal with homesickness, I
personally found that trying to line
up plenty of new and exciting things
to do can help. Keeping busy makes
it a lot harder to dwell on the things
you’re missing at home – plus when
you next see or talk to your family,
you will have loads of cool stuff to
tell them about.
But on the other hand, it is also
absolutely okay to take a day where
you cuddle up in your room, watch
Netflix or a DVD, have some tea
and chocolate and just let yourself
feel a bit rubbish, call your parents
and comfort yourself with fluffy
socks and blankets. Of course that’s
just my method, but finding your
own way of practising self-care and
allowing yourself a healthy way
to express and work through your
emotions is very important.
The next most important thing
though is to know when to stop
indulging yourself. After spending
a day feeling down, try to make
yourself do something sociable, be it
attending a freshers’event or baking
cookies in the kitchen in halls – and
trust me, the kitchens are wonderful
areas for friendship-formation!
Dealing with the social anxiety
that made it hard to talk to people in
the first place was somewhat more
difficult, and coping mechanisms
for this are even more personal than
those of self-care. General helpful
tips include practising breathing
exercises or repeating some mantra
that gives you self-confidence,
reinforcing your ability to just walk
up to someone, introduce yourself,
and start a conversation.
Another thing that can be useful
is to try and pull your thoughts
into perspective. This is very tricky,
and in itself the advice of ‘get
some perspective’ can be radically
unhelpful.But try to take some time
to breathe and remind yourself that
others probably won’t notice the
mistakes and social awkwardness
that seems glaring to you.
It can be liberating when you
accept that things won’t go perfectly
with everyone you say hello to.There
Coping with tough times in this
brave new Imperial world
are just so many people at Imperial
that it’s impossible to connect with
and befriend everybody,but this also
means that amongst our number you
are guaranteed to find some people
who you will ‘click’ with. Generally
speaking students are always
grateful to find another person who
is feeling a bit overwhelmed.
You are under no obligation to
immediately form a group and have
a perfectly structured social life – it’s
okay if it takes a while to find your
circle of friends. But if you persist
in investigating all the clubs and
societies, and keep on striking up
conversations with the people you
think are interesting, it will pay off.
Finally, bear in mind that there
are so many resources available for
you if you’re feeling worried or alone
or overwhelmed. Take a look at our
resources section and pick a person
or group you feel most comfortable
talking to – and don’t forget that
your peers can also be a great source
of validation and comfort!
Good luck on your first year at
Imperial. It can be tough – the
workload will build up quickly –
but it’s more than worth it. I hope
you all get settled in and have a
wonderful Welcome Week and rest
of year!
