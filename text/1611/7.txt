nder the strain of
thousands of people
seeking refuge in
Europe,several countries
including Germany began to restrict
their borders, after decades of free
travel within the continent and the
Shengen Area.
As a result, my well­planned and
advance booked night train from
Vienna to Munich, being a direct
train from Budapest, was partially
and then fully cancelled in the
early afternoon. I hurried to the
train station, cursing the refugees,
assuming that I would be able to
switch to a different train fairly
easily.
When I got to the station, it was
clear that this wouldn’t be the case.
Thebackofthestationwasorganised
chaos, with volunteers and refugees
milling around, distributing food
or organising people. Sleeping and
children’s play areas had been set
up, and this had clearly become a
temporary home for hundreds of
families. At the ticket office, armed
police were guarding the ticket
machines, inspecting passports
before you were allowed to buy a
ticket, not that it would have got
you anywhere.
This crisis needs actions, not words

T
his summer I had a
typical first year student
holiday and went
interrailing around
Europe. During this trip we spent
three days in Budapest, Hungary
frequenting the assortment of cheap
bars and inexpensive restaurants
due to the excellent Pound to Forint
exchange rate.
On the last day we had to catch
a night train from Budapest to
Krakow which meant catching the
metro to the Keleti train station­
.
As soon as we stepped out of
the metro, we were greeted by the
sight of tens upon tens of families
sleeping, eating and living on
the ground floor of this station,
each lying with all their worldly
possessions on a variety of flattened
cardboard boxes.
We walked in silence as the various
other travellers that were due to
depart from Keleti train station
filtered past the asylum seekers in
order to catch their trains.
As I passed one family I saw a
young boy, about eleven gesture
to one of the stations cleaners to
borrow his broom as he wanted to
clean what little space his family
occupied.
A small boy approached me,
no more than five years old, with
bloodshot eyes and gestured towards
the stall selling pastries and then
pointed at his mouth, stretching
out his hands and all I could do was
helplessly shrug and indicate that I
had no money left.
We then passed up the escalator
to the train platforms where there
was no sign that you had ever seen
anything out of the ordinary.
Before this experience, my only
knowledge of the Syrian asylum
seekers had been that of distant
ideas of barricaded channel tunnels
and David Cameron’s promise
that there was no better life here
awaiting these “migrants”.
There was nothing as sobering
as walking through this and then
watching a Hungarian train
employee search underneath the
train carriages with a flashlight in
order to make sure there weren’t
people risking their lives for another
country.
For many people there was a single
moment this summer when their
opinions of nervous discomfort
of these Syrian migrants making
their way across Europe to become
a National Burden became one of,
well, human compassion. But the
fact that it took photos of a drowned
three year old boy on a Turkish
beach should disturb us all.
The photo of Aylan Kurdi’s
limp body became the defining
image of this summer, with many
publications refusing to publish
the pictures showing his full body;
but before long this three year old’s
corpse had become nothing more
than clickbait to be shared among
social media users as an attempt to
look interested in something other
than themselves.
One newspaper was even
advocating at the end of an article
about Aylan Kurdi’s journey to tweet
using the hashtag #refugeeswelcome
and then to sign their own petition,
which all feels so very close to the
‘pat yourself on the back’ culture of
egotistical charity support that we
only recently saw with the ALS ice
bucket challenge.
Perhaps social media is again
culpable: the sidebar on the right of
the Facebook home page now gives
all users a brief list of current events,
allowing us to selectively participate
in what has been deemed important.
It feels like once again our national
reaction to this tragedy is one of self
aggrandising for the small time we
spend campaigning for social action,
and by signing an online petition we
can go forward and forget.
The one thing that makes me
feel incredibly uncomfortable is
the fact that only now when the
image of this dead child has been
seen are people starting to wake up
to this crisis. Since May there has
been report after report after report

of asylum seekers crossing the
mediterranean sea to escape from
a home that is no longer safe, often
with hundreds of people crammed
into these small boats, hopefully
making it to Greece, but more often
than not, relying on a European
coastguard being nearby to save
them.

The scale of what Europe is
facing rapidly hit me. Although
still accepting refugees, Germany
is obviously desperate to regain
some control over the situation, and
the border at this rail crossing is
probably going to remain closed for
some time.I had to find another way
to get to Munich.
Tickets into Germany were scarce,
selling out quickly, and mainly only
available at sales offices, not online.
Buses seemed to be the only way,
but with roadblocks throughout
Austria, and the border being
partially closed, it wasn’t clear if
anything would be running at all,
how delayed it might be, or if it
might have to turn back. Neither
the bus operators nor the staff at
the bus stations could offer any
reassurances. After a day of chasing
tickets for services that shortly got
cancelled, I shelled out a final €40
for a night bus that looked hopeful,
and settled down for an evening
of obsessing about roadblocks and
border controls.
Just before midnight, dozens of
clearly stressed people waited for
the bus, worrying about where
they would stay should they be
left without anywhere to go in the
middle of the night. When the
bus finally arrived, the passengers
desperately swarmed towards it,
overpowering the driver.
I was lucky. The only thing that
this cost me was a wasted ticket to
the ballet (that I didn’t go to so I
could catch the bus), some money,
and a few hours of my time. I
was stressed, for sure, but it was
nothing compared to the stress
and desperation that has become
the reality for many families whose
lives have become a matter of trying
to find ways to travel to the next
country.
In most of the central European
countries, people are clearly very
sympathetic to their plight, and
are very willing to offer provisions,
belongings, time and space to help
ease the situation.
In the UK we’re clearly shielded
from the worst of this crisis. Beyond
the basics in the news, I hadn’t
kept abreast of all the reporting
surrounding this exodus of
humanity,and so it wasn’t until I saw
the crisis for myself that it became
more of a reality, and I immediately
become far more empathetic.
Cold, hard facts can tell you a
lot about a situation, but to really
understand it, you need to feel.

to those that cannot witness
something first­hand.

I am humbled to admit that the

something that is important to me,

these people as people rather than a
faceless­
, job-taking horde.
My question is: why did it take an
image of a dead child to change the
national sentiment?
It has to be said that within
Europe there is a general unease
about allowing more migrants into
the respective countries, and in
Britain it is even further heightened
by our national propensity to feel
that we are separate to the rest of
Europe and its woes, whether that
be economic, social, or political.
There is a palpable unease within
the parties as to what the British
people’s attitude to remaining in the
EU is.
I believe that a great amount
of that comes from our heavily
ingrained idealism that as an island
nation the literal geographical
separation also separates us from
the aforementioned issues, and
therefore a responsibility for them.
What remains now is to wait until
the situation settles: at the time
of writing, the Hungarian border
police have set up a barrier to the
displaced peoples, retaliating in
waves of tear gas and baton strikes.
Croatia has become the new route
to pursue for these people,with their
prime minister freely admitting that
there is no way that they can stop
the flow of asylum seekers.
The truth is that no one knows
what will happen with this current
crisis­
: will Cameron relent with the
current figure of 20,000 migrants
over the next 5 years, will there
be an E.U consensus on a unified
response to work towards a more
stable Europe?
Frankly this situation will only
take time, money, and planning.
What it doesn’t need is views, likes,
and shares.
