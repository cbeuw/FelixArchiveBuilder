-Dreams in Colour
Exodus - Marquee
What a wonderfully creative thing
war is. I produces such
masterpieces of art, the juices just
seem to flow. Recorded during the
civil war in Yugoslavia this
collection of ditties was originally
destined to be used in a dance
production called Emotional. But,
due to circumstances beyond their
control (even British Rail can't do
as good as mortar bombs) we have
the pleasure of listening to it. And
a pleasure it is. Being distributed by
'Play it Again Sam' records it
should fall neatly into the Eurobeat
style of dance music. This it fails
to do completely. Its rather hard to
describe, being at time orchestral,
at others hard edged, but always
moving. No. there are no bombs
falling in the background; yes, they
do use the odd four letter word; but,
who gives a fuck. This may be
considered more far out than the
chances of the Liberal Democrats
winning the election but purely for
the experience you should by this
record. Failing that, it will impress
the hell out of your flat-mates.
Pebbles

It's difficult to take the Well of
Hvergelmir seriously these days.
What was once The Mythological
Apex is now merely a safe haven
for anally-retentive and inneffectual
gods. Worse, Freya just ain't sexy
anymore, and I blame Led
Zeppelin. All sadly-reduced, babes
of pathos, existing in the memory
of the halcyon daze of 'Blake's
Seven'.
'Hey, look Avon, it's a spaceship
with everything we could ever
need, ever'. Come back, Chris
Boucher. The Fendahl was a
masterpiece. Incidentally, did you
see Agnetha and Anni-Frid (talk
about alliteration) singing 'Eagle' at
the weekend? Brilliant, eh?.
Destroy your birthright, Freitag.
It's synonymous with You, Too.
Worst pun ever. Bono dog biscuit.
I applaud your bloody- mindedness,
sir; it's the kinda thing that keeps
ya cool, minty fresh and pearly
white.

Sugarcubes
- Stick Around for Joy
And if you've just joined us the
score is 1-1, the Sugarcubes scoring
a goal in the opening minutes, a
move from nowhere, Planet hitting
the net. And then later in the game,
an own goal from Here Today,
Tomorrow, Next Week. Just
recently, Hit hit the net, but was
disallowed from this for being a 45.
The atmosphere is electric here, for
if the Sugarcubes lose a goal now,
they will surely be out of the album
championships. What do you think,
Lise?'
Thank you Brian. I think they
might make it. It's not as bad as
Here but it's not as good as
anything off Planet. And Einar. the
silly one who speaks over
everything, still buggers things up
by his mere existence. Hit is the
only song that really stands out', as
a really good song, as chart single
material. But that's no help,
because they've released that
already.
There's no emotion any more
with The Sugarcubes, that's the
problem. I think. Bjork, the little
pretty one who used to scream a lot,
doesn't scream any more. That was
their appeal, not just the fact that
they were the only thing ever to
come out of Iceland and not attempt
to steal our fish, novel though that
concept is. And now it's gone, in
the main. So there. They've blown
it, 1 think. And now back to Brian
in the commentary box.
'It's an album of two sides, I
think'

Snail.

Academy on March 7.
Not often has the Marquee been this
crowded this early in the evening.
With this one-off show being their
first U K appearance in a long, long
time, Exodus certainly managed to
pull a crowd well over the legal
capacity of 105 Charing Cross
Road. There was no need to have
turned up quite so promptly,
though; Inner Sanctum were a bit
on the shit side, to say the least.
Quite what they meant by calling
themselves 'techno-tracks' is
anybody's guess—what we got was
second rate power-metal with nasty
shrieking vocals.
And then: Exodus, who strolled
onto the stage to an ecstatic
welcome, they burst into AC/DC's
Dirty Deeds Done Dirty Cheap,
exploiting to the full the uncanny
similarity between the vocal talents
of lead singer Steve Sowza and the
late, great Bon Scott. The crowd
went absolutely potty. There
followed tracks from all four
albums, plus three new songs from
the recently recorded Force of
Habit which is going to be totally
excellent if this was anything to go
by. The heaviest and yet the most
tuneful I have heard yet from this
band.
The pit was full of flailing bodies,
the stagedivers were finding ever
more perilous and ludicrous perches
from which to hurl themselves, and
then came the Toxic Waltz—Good
friendly violent fun in store for
all...if you hit the floor you can
always crawl'. This remains the
ultimate moshing ditty. Forget
Metallica's pretentious works of
art, forget all this ultra-heavy devil-
music, if you want a good time this
is where it's at. Who says thrash is
dead?
