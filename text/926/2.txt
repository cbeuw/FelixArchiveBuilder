Letters Felix 926 14 February 1992
Acidic Viniculture
Dear Adam,
May I firstly commend you upon
your commitment to the defence of
your editorial freedom, however
this is only part of the job you were
elected for and, judging by my own
recent experiences and those of
others, most notably Rocksoc (Felix
925), perhaps your other duties
have been neglected somewhat. As
well as Felix editor, you are Print
Unit Manager whose task it is to
provide a printing service for the
clubs and societies of ICU. From
the start of the year the Felix
photocopier has been out of order
and although its performance is not
under your control it is surely not
too much to ask that the Manager
of the Print Unit should organise for
it to be fixed.
Publicity is of prime importance
for clubs organising events where
not only their reputation but also a
NatWest Again
Dear Sir,
After an 'unfortunate' incident on
January 31 at the IC Nat West
branch, I feel obliged to write to
you. Every month, I transfer a
cheque worth £205.00 into my bank
account. When this transaction is
completed after authorisation by
telephone, I withdraw the equal
amount from my account. The sum
is used to pay my rent.
On the above mentioned day, I
endeavoured to do the same. This
time however, my request was
refused by the cashier. Surprised as
I was, I asked to see the manager
(Mr Jamieson), who, after a fifteen
minute wait, bluntly refused to cash
the cheque or give any further
explanation. On pointing out to him
that on the three previous occasions
there had not been any problem, he
told me, 'the past has nothing to do
with the present!'. He added that
our lack in communication was
probably due to 'our difference in
background (!)'. He also questioned
my attitude towards college in
general, of which he has no
knowledge.
Eventually, the matter was solved
by my paying a £5 telephone
charge, to ensure the cheque would
clear. The Current Account Tariff
leaflet (published by Nat West)
clearly states however, that this fee
must not be charged when a service
card is presented. My service card
had been in M r Jamieson's hands
for the past fifty minutes.
Furthermore, I was later told none
of those charges apply to students
anyway.
The whole incident was
conducted in an insulting and
unprofessional manner, not one you
would expect from a bank which
prides itself on a positive approach
to students, but more akin to a
small-time swindler.
I hope this charge and his
deliberately hostile attitude were
entirely due to his Friday afternoon
desire to end business and not a
reflection of his general attitude
towards students. Students find it
difficult enough to survive in
London as it is, without having to
deal with the unsympathetic
approach of their bank managers.
Yours faithfully,
J Van Hooydonck, Geology 2.
lot of their finance is at stake.
People should not have to use
Stabur Graphics yet on several
occasions this year Guilds has had
to resort to their services to get
Guildsheet out in time despite you
knowing of the print dates months
in advance. Even when jobs are
delivered on time it is usually only
thanks to constant chasing up by the
group of people who need the
material.
The Union should have no
control of what you say in Felix,
you are the editor, but when people
need printed material in order to
publicise or run a successful event
these jobs should take a higher
priority than they appear to at the
the minute. When it comes to
printing jobs you are there to
provide a service for us.
Yours sincerely.
Tim Proctor.
RockSoc Again
Adam.
Thank you so much for printing
Poddy's highly amusing reply to my
letter in last week's edition. For his
information I can spell puerile,
along with a host of other words.
One thing that was carefully ignored
was the fact that the letter was typed
to avoid any confusion over my
'illegible scrawl'. Although my wit
and intelligence are as quick as they
are sharp, alas my fingers are not
so nimble and I am prone to the odd
typing error. Something you are
quite familiar with yourselves
judging from the amount of
mistakes in Felix 925. Apart from
ICSF's 'Purty Tests' and Poddy's
own Tngorance', you even
managed to leave an f off fact in my
own contribution. Other notable
omissions included an explanation
for your( personal behaviour or the
slightest hint of an apology. As your
actions seem indefensible I am
instead subjected to a petty personal
attack from fellow members of your
staff.
To clarify matters once and for
all, unlike the members of Dramsoc
and Opsoc whose actions were
A Few Misconceptions
Dear Adam,
I just wish to clear up a few
misconceptions that made
themselves obvious in your editorial
relating to the mass-removal of
Felices by C & G in 1987.
The reason for their removal was
that Felix had made up and printed
their own advert for the Guilds
Carnival (admittedly because the
C & G publicity team hadn't got their
arses into gear). The tone of this
advert was such that, although it
said that people should go, it was
feared that a lot of students would
be turned off the event; hence the
dawn raid.
The news stories, to which Dave
Tyler, the then President objected
on the grounds of unfairness,
merely pricked at his over-inflated
and over-sensitive ego and revenge
for them was not a motice for the
removal (although they may have
coloured his judgement).
The lawsuit against Felix later
that year had nothing to do with
news stories but with a column
called 'Blackmail' whose author
(Delator, where are you now?) had
got hold of a College Notable's
stolen filofax and had printed
excerpts from the diary concerning
horizontal athletics, Galaxy bars
and exaggerated claims of staying
power. The deal was that the owner
of the filofax should pay a ransom
to Rag or be named. Unfortunately,
the notable's girlfriend's first name
was mentioned and its idiosyncratic
spelling resulted in instant
identification; hence the lawsuit on
the grounds of invasion of privacy,
humiliation, using information
obtained from stolen goods (Paddy
Ashdown, take note) etc. The
matter was settled out of court.
On a final note concerning
editorial responsibility, the opinions
expressed in Felix may well not be
those of the editor, and his freedom
from any external pressure over the
contents is sacrosanct (even UGM's
have said so!), a little discretion and
thoughtfulness on the part of the
editor makes life run so much more
smoothly and free from such upsets
concerned with their review, our
complaint is over the treatment of
our press release. Reviews may be
based on opinion but a press release
is fact. It appears that Rag are to
receive compensation from the
aforementioned societies for the
loss of their main publicity resulting
Tow attendance'. Our main
publicity was grossly mistreated, to
the same resulting loss, and yet
there appears to be no recompense
forthcoming from Felix to cover
our losses!
In reference to Poddy's further
opinions, he is neither 'my friend'
nor has ever met me, therefore I
don't feel I need defend my music
tastes, however varied they may be.
Perhaps if he had bothered
attending our event he may have
been able to form some opinions
based on fact for a change.
Finally. I would like to apologise
to the readers who must be as sick
of this affair as I am. Hopefully this
letter will be treated in a more
mature and sensible manner so the
whole matter can be brought to a
long overdue close.
A D Ham, Vice President
IC Rock Society.
as the events of last week. I agreed
with every word of the 'Grease'
review (having seen the show on
Thursday) but saving it for after the
show's run was over would have
hurt no one, would have been
tactful (a bad review can really mess
up the performances of non-
professionals as well as jeopardising
the success of a Union event) and
would have avoided last week's
unpleasantness.
'Publish and be damned' can be
an extreme policy with extreme
side-effects.
Yours,
Max Kallios, Mech Eng PG (and
one-time Guilds VP).
