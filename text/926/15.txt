widely used style of handwriting. It
was invented in the late Han
Dynasty (206BC-220AD), which,
translated literally means 'of the
running hand'. As its name
suggests, the calligraphy is dextrous
and quick in action, beautiful and
dynamic in perception.
During the interval, our M H 002
will stop over at an imaginary
foreign land, probably Tokyo,
Japan. Duty free goods (Coke,
crisps and peanuts!) will be sold.
Japanese Society may kindly help
out in the sale of their delicious
Sushi and refreshing green tea.
The fashion show is essentially a
live display of a kaleidoscopic
collection of 'Batik'. Batik means
'drawing art with wax'...since batik
is a wax resistance method of
dyeing. Wax is applied in patterns
over which dyes are sprayed, thus
protecting the area it covers. The

wax is then boiled away. The
process is repeated a few times,
resulting in free-flowing chromatic
designs. The fashion show will
prove to be'one of the highlight
events of the night.
What about the sketch? It is a
sorrowful and touching tale based
on the Malaysian village life in the
1950s. Conflict of interests and
jealousy between a real son and an
adopted son touches off a
progression of hatred, emnity and
eventually leads to the expulsion of
the latter from the family. The most
melodramatic part is the eventual
repentance of the real son, but he
was left with his fault unforgiven,
forever.
As for the musically inclined
people, you will be in for a treat.
There will be performances ranging
from acoustic guitars to high tech
sythesisers and music from the
exotic gongs to western blues.
Almost half of the music in store are
the original works of our members.
The music combines melodious
eastern tunes backed by modern and
orchestral echoes. The vocals are as
vibrant. An all-acoustic band, two
solo singers and a vocal group will
be singing hit songs of Malaysia and
abroad. The night will end with an
authentic evergreen song called
'Rasa Sayang', one of our
traditional ways of saying goodbye.
The song will also incorporate a few
verses of poems (Pantun), bringing
the message of everlasting
friendship and happiness.
Fascinating? Well, you have not
seen anything yet! Do come on
board our Flight M H 002 for a
glimpse of our rich traditions and
heritage and a journey enhanced
with our warmth and friendly
persona.
