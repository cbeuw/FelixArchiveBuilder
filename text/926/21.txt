14 February 1992 Felix 926 Opinion
Dear English Friends,
The tragic situation in South
Ossetia makes us write to you and
ask for your support.
Since the autumn of 1989 the
nationalistic forces of the Republic
of Georgia have been carrying out
an armed terror and violence
campaign against the Osset
population both in Ossetia and in
inner parts of Georgia. South
Ossetia has been undergoing a
military, political, economic and
informational blockade. Since 1991
more than 300 people have been
killed, hundreds of people
wounded, more than 160 are
missing and more than 480 have
been brutally tortured or mutilated
beyond recognition. Many of them
had their ears, noses, tongues and
other parts cut off, their eyes put
out. their faces and bodies burned
by blow-lamps. As a result of
winter blockade dozens of people -
mainly the eldery and children -
died of hunger and cold. The
population of 90 villages within and
outside South Ossetia have been
forced to leave their homes, over 65
villages have been plundered,
burned down and destroyed by
tanks. The number of refugees from
South Ossetia and Georgia today is
above 100.000. A great number of
people, among them Thorez
Kulumbegov. a leader of South
Osset Government, are languishing
in Georgian prisons. What is
happening here is a gross violation
of national minorities' rights and of
human rights as well. It's a mass-
scale extermination of the Ossets.
It's a genocide.
The situation is extremely tragic.
The capital of our region -
Tskhinvali - and villages nearby are
heavily bombarded. Houses are
destroyed and every day we have to
burs our friends and relatives,
among which there are children,
women and elderly people.
The armed aggression and
violence in South Ossetia is
combined with propaganda
campaign which has the aim to
justify before the world public the
aggression against the minor nation.
The Ossets are labelled as
newcomers' on the land where our
ancestors have lived for thousands
of years. According to the antique
historians (Strabo. X!.111,3) the
Osset ancestors - Sarmats-Alans -
lived on this land since a.d. If this
period is short for deserving the
right of being called a native people
then what can one say about the
white Americans who appeared in
America after Columbus? Or
equally about the Russians in
Siberia who moved there after
Ermak's campaigns, or about the
Hungarians who came to Europe in
the Middle Ages?
In 1920 Georgia became a part of
the USSR. The Bolsheviks, who
considered the absorption of smaller
nations by greater ones as a factor
of progress, divided the Osset lands
between Russia (North Ossetia) and
Georgia (South Ossetia). The
bolshevik government made a rich
gift to Georgia by including South
Ossetia in the Georgian Republic.
Being a part of Georgia had tragic
results for South Ossets. Our people
have undergone oppression and
forced assimilation. In 1920 the
Georgian government implemented
the policy of a genocide, as a result
of which more than 5,000 people

called stars of democracy, including
the great pacifier Shevardnadse.
who were called upon to protect
people against violence and to
ensure security, have demonstrated
full inability and unwillingness to
defend the people of South Ossetia
from the danger of being
exterminated. It is their tacit consent
that inspires the Georgian
'democrats' to new barbarous acts
and hideous crimes.
The results of the coming events
are not hard to foretell. Very soon
nothing will be left df South Ossetia
except the burnt out land and dozens

were killed and many thousands
died when escaping to North
Ossetia over the Caucasian
mountains.
Today the Georgians are trying
to represent the war against South
Ossetia as an ethnic conflict
whereas in reality it is an
extermination of peaceful people
carried out by the well-armed
Georgian troops. The crimes
condemned at Niirnberg can't be
-compared with those committed by
the lawfully elected Georgian
.government.
All the crimes of the Georgian
aggressors have been only partly
covered by the Soviet mass media.
The English correspondents were
among the first to break through the
information blockade of South
Ossetia. the first to tell the world
public the truth about the crimes of
the 5-.5 million Georgian nationals
against 65 thousand Ossets. We are
very grateful to them.
The central government doesn't
stop the violence, it hasn't even
introduced the emergency rule on
the South Osset territory. The
of thousands of corpses which no
one will be left even to bury. This
will happen if Georgian aggression
is not stopped.
South Ossetia is not Kuwait.
There are no oil fields in this land.
The great powers have no interests
which they might defend. South
Ossetia is a test of genuine
democracy for those who consider
themselves advocates of human
rights because they can't expect
economic benefit in return for
supporting the Ossets rights for
freedom and life.
We appeal to you for support.
Don't let the injustice triumph,
don't let the innocent people be
exterminated. Raise your voice
against the violence in South
Ossetia. Each death in this dirty war
against our people is not only a dark
stain on the conscience of our
murderers. The responsibility lies
also on those who encourage these
Nazis to new crimes by keeping
silent. Students of the English

As the former
Soviet Union
collapses,
violence and
hatred begin
their rule
