On Monday the annual Photo Soc
exhibition opened. Fifteen
photographers from both Photo Soc
and. by invitation, Felix displayed
a wide variety of work. Overall the
standard is very high, though there
are a couple of obvious exceptions.
The 58 photographs fill the
Sherfield Anteroom comfortably
without overcrowding it. Whoever
actually hung the prints did well to
make the most of the lighting
available. I overheard some
criticism that they were hung too
close together, but it was useful to
be able to compare multiple pictures
by the same artist, (if you ever
doubted that photography is an art,
you should visit this exhibition).
Technically it was difficult to find
fault with most of the prints, which
had been in the most part printed by
the photographer. This could
explain the dominant presence of
black and white over colour prints,
but some prints were detracted from
by the less than competent
mounting. A small moan perhaps,
but considering the time that must
have been spent in the darkroom
another few minutes could have
been well rewarded. Consequently,
most of my comments are restricted
to personal opinions and perhaps a
few prejudices. Those attending the
opening on Monday evening had the
advantage of the presence of the
photographers who were generally
happy to discuss their work,
explaining it where necessary,
though I did find the persistent
presence of one particular
photographer a little annoying.
I have not listed my thoughts on
every shot - you can go and make
up your own minds - but here is a
taste of what can be seen. The first
photograph is perfectly chosen, a
striking window shot by a relative
newcomer to the darkroom, Sarah
Too. It does not hold your attention
for too long, yet is difficult to
ignore. This is contrasted by Simon
Bolton's 'Tottenham Court Road',
in which every face tells a story,
and to which there is great depth.
The exhibition is dominated by
A characteristic technique is not
obvious in some of the work, but
Andreas Brakoolias has a very
definite style. I personally liked his
original work, particularly 'Dusk,
Greece', but some found it
disturbing, or perhaps disturbed!
Similarly, the work of Matthew
Johnson was consistent in style,
although I dislike the printing of
some of his work as they could be
more punchy. They have a superb
reportage quality.
Of the small collection of colour
Photographic Exhibition
the work of one photographer,
Alvis Fong. His work is some of the
best I have seen in any exhibition,
but unfortunately he has also
entered the worst picture in the
exhibition. 'Feeding' should never
have been included in an otherwise
strong collection. A number of
studies in black and white can only
be described as excellent - 'Repair',
accompanying this review, and
'Houseboat' in particular, drew me
back again and again. Fong's
equipment is somewhat elitist, F3s
and F4s, not to mention the use of
a Hasselblad, but his work has
shown that these are only tools, that
it is the photographer that makes the
photograph. His versatility is
demonstrated with 'Greenery',
which is something quite out of the
ordinary.
prints, 'Statue and Half Dome' by
Stef Smith stands out, both due to
its quality and considerable size.
Also, Steven Kenny's sunrise was
satisfyingly simple, though his
'evening' could have been better
cropped.
Finally, I have to mention Kate
Parker's 'Harley-Davidson' and
'Iron Horse' by Edward Dunin-
Wasowicz, purely because I liked
them. I would recommend this
exhibition to anyone, whether or not
you are interested in photography,
it caters for a wide range of tastes,
and might provoke a few thoughts.
It closes on 28th February.
Anyone wishing to get involved
in the Photographic Society should
contact James Evans, Mech Eng II,
or visit Southside at 1.00pm on
Tuesday.
