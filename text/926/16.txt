HIV—if you asked people in the
street what those three letters mean
to them, most of them would tell
you it was a disease related to-
AIDS, some may even know the
symptoms or how it can be
transmitted but few would know all
the facts or realise just how many
people are affected by it.
HIV stands for Human
Immunodeficiency Virus. If the
virus gets into the bloodstream of
a person, it begins to attack the
white blood cells (T4 cells). These
cells form part of the immune
system and help to prevent the body
from getting diseases. HIV enters
the T4 cells and makes them
produce more of the virus which
eventually kills the T4 cells.
Eventually there are not enough T4
cells to protect the body from
infection.
The majority of people with HIV
infection show no signs of illness
and will look and feel well and
healthy. Some people . may
experience symptoms shortly after
infection. These many include night
sweats, swollen glands, weight loss
or a persistent cough. These
symptoms are very similar to those
associated with the common cold or
flu. The virus may lie dormant for
up to ten years before any signs
become apparent.
Other people may go on to
develop further symptoms of their
HIV infection including persistent
swelling of the lymph glands in the
neck, armpits and groin, continuous
tiredness, unexplained weight loss,
continuous dry cough not related to
smoking, diarrhoea, thrush,
unexplained bleeding, shortness of
breath, cold sores, night sweats and
fevers.
The development of any of these
symptoms does not mean that you
will go on to develop AIDS—
however they are a sign that the
immune system is not working
properly.
However, a number of people
infected with HIV will go on to
develop AIDS. AIDS stands for
Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome. 'Acquired' refers to any
condition which is not present at
birth. 'Immune deficiency' means
that the body's immune system,
which fights off illnesses, is not
working efficiently. AIDS is not a
single disease: it is a 'Syndrome'—
or-group-of specific infections and
cancers, which occur because the
body's immune system has been
compromised.
The condition that we now
recognise as AIDS was first
reported in the USA in 1981.
Between June and November of mat
year, 159 reports of people with
AIDS were received. Three
quarters of them come from three
major US cities and 95% were gay
men. The first reports of AIDS in
the U K were in London in
December 1981.
There were, undoubtedly, people
with AIDS before 1981, but careful
retrospective studies have shown
that it was rare and affected few
people compared to the numbers
now involved. AIDS must have
been exceedingly rare before the
mid-1970s anywhere in the world.
AIDS now occurs in most
countries. The number of people
with AIDS varies enormously
between countries, but most of them
come from large towns rather than
rural areas.
Worldwide, most people with
AIDS are heterosexual men and
women. However, in the developed
countries, AIDS has first affected
gay men, haemophiliacs and
injecting drug users.
By December 1990, the World
Health Organisation (WHO) had
received reports of over 305,000
people with AIDS from 179
countries, but they estimate that the
true number of cases is likely to be
more than 800,000 with between'
8-10 million infected with HIV.
The majority of people with HIV
infection do not have AIDS, so HIV
infection is more common than
AIDS. The W H O estimates that
65% of all global HIV infections
have resulted from heterosexual
intercourse.
The number of people in the U K
who have been tested and are
therefore known to be infected with
HIV is 16,248. The total number
carrying the virus has been
estimated to be as many as 100,000
of which 5,191 had been officially
reported as having AIDS by
September 1991.
In the U K the proportion of
people infected with HIV differs
between regions and between
different groups of people.
44% of people with haemophilia
(who are usually male) were
infected by 1985, before the
contamination of donated blood was
controlled. This is known to involve
approximately 1,200 people.
People who have injected drugs
have rates of infection from under
2% in some regions to 70%, with
the highest proportion found in
Edinburgh.
Gay men attending sexually
transmitted disease (STD) clinics
have rates of infection from less
than 2% to 25%, depending on the
clinic, i
Other heterosexual people with
HIV infection have been infected
abroad. Heterosexual spread of
HIV also occurs among injecting
drug users and their sexual partners.
In the U K , the great majority of
people known to be infected with
HIV are gay and bisexual men and
haemophilacs. However, this trend
is changing. Injecting drug users
and heterosexual men and women
represent an increasing percentage
of those with HIV infection. During
1990-1991 the numbers of HIV
carriers rose by 17 % in homosexual
men, 36% in heterosexual men and
93 % in women. 70% of people with
HIV in the U K are in London and
there are about 150 new cases of
HIV every month—which is about
5 per day.
HIV is not easily passed from
person to person. The virus is not
'caught' in the same way as diseases
like chicken-pox or 'flu'. It is
transmitted through:
1. Sexual contact, especially anal
and vaginal intercourse. However,
not all sexual activities are risky.
2. Shared use of needles and
syringes may transmit HIV. This
includes sharing 'works' to inject a
drug, repeated use of medical
injection equipment for more than
one patient, and re-use of
acupuncture, tattooing", or body
piercing needles without proper
sterilisation. Very rarely, accidental
injury with contaminated needles
has transmitted HIV to a health
worker.
3. In the past, from blood
transfusion and products made from
blood used to treat haemophilia.
4. From mother to baby, before
(and perhaps during) birth. After
birth, H I V may rarely be
transmitted by breast feeding.
Certain sexual activities or drug-
using activities that are able to
transmit HIV from one person to
another are called 'high risk
activities'. Even then, it must be
remembered that for exposure to
occur, one person must already be
infected by HIV.
HIV is not transmitted by insect
bites, nor through coughing or
sneezing, swimming pools or toilets
seats as insufficient amounts of
virus are present.
What do you think?
Whenever something unknown
happens, people react in different
ways—horror, compassion, guilt
and plain incomprehension. When
AIDS was first identified in 1981,
and HIV isolated two years later,
most of us experienced these
reactions. There was talk of 'guilty'
and 'innocent' people, or a 'plague'
and of a disease 'punishing' people.
But how can people be guilty of
having an illness, and how can a
virus be said to punish certain
sectors of society? People with
AIDS, or who are HIV-positive, are
no more victims of a vicious virus
than people who catch a cold. One
thing that AIDS has meant is that
everyone has to be honest, to admit
to the past and to realise that the
morality of sexual relationships has
changed. The one-night stand now
means more than simply fun—it
could mean one person passing on
a virus that can develop into a series
of cruel diseases.
We have to work out a code of
conduct that encourages honesty,
and admit U» our weaknesses. AIDS
means that everyone has to think
about what their actions mean for
themselves in terms of feelings and
health and for the well-being of
others.
