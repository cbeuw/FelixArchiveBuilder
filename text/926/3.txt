14 February 1992 Felix 926 Editorial
editoria
Tim Proctor's letter.
Correct. I am the Print Unit
Manager. But my job is not one of
generating publicity for ICU clubs
- I manage the Print Unit. In the
purest sense of the word this would
mean maximising profit for the
Unit, which would exclude all
internal print work, for which we
charge only the cost of the materials
and an amount toward the
replacement of equipment. You do
not pay for labour and we operate
ori a self help basis where possible.
But I work for a student Union, so,
in fact, I have to deal with hundreds
of students' enquiries, ranging from
the completely clueless and inept to
the imaginative and enthusiastic.
Bearing in mind the voluntary
nature of most of the staff in the
Felix Office and Print Unit as well
as the wide variety of clients, it is
completely unreasonable to expect
a 100% efficient streamlined
service. Printing stuff for other
bodies started as a favour, as neither
the printing press nor the typesetter
belong to the Union, but they were
given to Felix expressly for Felix
production in part payment for
moving from what is now the
Biology Common Room. Printing
ICU business other than Felix is
secondary to Felix, and has to be
fitted in when there is time. I am
under no obligation at all to provide
a print service to anybody, but I do
to help the smoother running of the
Union. As for the photocopier, if
you have a spare £100 to call out
a mechanic who will only draw in
breath, say 'God, who installed
this? It's got to go,' and disappear
like your money will, I would feel
vindicated. Likewise I would be
grateful for information as to how
to fix the damn thing. I do not relish
paying nearly a £1000 a quarter for
a pile of junk that only rattles and
smells disgusting when turned on -
the service contract was drawn up
two years ago, since which time the
servicing company has gone
bankrupt taking with it our money
and a lot of other people's.
I do not know the printing dates
of Guildsheet months in advance.
Indeed last term there were so many
last minute changes of publication
date that I lost count. It is fitted in
when it can be, and when it can't

it is referred on. As a point of
information, the Felix printer is not
paid for his overtime by the Union.
Instead, he is given time and a half
in lieu - ie, for every hour of
overtime he can take one and a half
hours holiday anytime. Last year he
built up several weeks worth of
overtime which he would never
have time to take off, as evidenced
by the amount of overtime he had
to do to keep up with the work.
Eventually an amicable
arrangement was reached, but this
year the same thing has started to
occur. To avoid the situation as per
last year, he has decided to work off
the time owed in lieu week by
week, and the both of us have
decided to cut back on other work.
This results in three days of printing
per week, of which Felix takes at
least two, and occasionally three. I
can't change the laws of space and
time, though a proximate action is
being undertaken to rearrange the
Print Unit, in co-operation with the
Union Office. As an alternative to
dumping all overflow print work,
it is redirected to Stabur Graphics,
a company in which I have no
financial interest in whatsoever,
who use the Print Unit's equipment
when the Print Unit's printer isn't,
and who pay the Unit a rent for the
privilege.
RockSoc letter
Firstly, I did not respond to the
RockSoc letter of last week because
Poddy had already had a go and I
thought it unfair to respond as well.
Secondly, more important things
took over the editorial. Poddy is
entitled to his own views, for which
he must take responsibility and
which I will neither endorse nor
denigrate.
The original letter said I had been
rude when faced with Mr Ham.
This is quite true. I believe Mr Ham
entered the office with the offending
Felix, flicked the offending article
with his finger and said T want an
explanation of this.' That sort of
opening gambit is bound to raise my
hackles, and by God it did. Sorry.
This letter was not couched in such
a way that demanded response as it
was merely an undisciplined rant -
with an unpleasant personal taint to
it. As for 'violating' my duty as
editor, 1 understand that that meant
that I should not have allowed
Poddy's bit to go in. Why not? It
goes in for the same reason that I
allowed both RockSoc letters in. I
can't go around telling people what
to write. My duty as editor is more
of a legal and moral one, to protect
Felix, it's staff and myself from
legal action caused by inaccurate
and defamatory articles, not to ban
articles I disagree with. You didn't
like what went in? Tough. This is
a ludicrous subject and I resent
using up editorial space with it. If
you think the quality of Felix is low,
come and help raise it.
Rumbling On
Dear Adam.
I am appalled at the disregard for
other students shown by the
members of the 'Grease' crew who
stole 3.500 copies of Felix on 31st
January. This was a particularly
narrow-minded and selfish act
which. I believe, should be
punished further.
No apology, however 'sincere',
can replace the hard work of the
'Felix' team or of those who
organised the Cluedo event on the
2nd of February. The money to be
paid to Rag by the thieves partly
compensates for the harm done, but
it is surely the principle of the
matter that counts.
Anyone who believes that they
have the right to censure Felix must
also believe that they know what is
best for us 'lowly' students. Well,
1 for one resent anyone trying to tell
me what to do or think.
I did try to find the time to see
Grease on its last night, but was
unable to due to a backlog of work.
This is despite reading the review
on Friday 31st (yes, I did find a
copy of Felix that was not stolen!).
I actually thought the review was
not that bad. I am now glad that I
didn't see the performance and will
certainly avoid future DramSoc
productions.
So, what are the chances of
justice being done? I'm afraid that
they are very small due to the
involvement of Ms Hellinger in the
affair. Yet again she has shown her
complete contempt for IC students
making me wonder why she chose
to stand for the job in the first place.
If she had any guts at all she would
have done the decent thing and
resigned by now. But no, she
obviously feels that she is not
accountable to the student
population, something that really
makes my blood boil... Power
corrupts I suppose.
Well Adam, I feel sorry for you.
It appears that little can be done to
rectify the situation. Our only hope
is that more students feel just as
outraged and force the Union to do
something. Maybe this is a bit
optimistic!
Yours irately.
Ian Jones, Biology PG.
