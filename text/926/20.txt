Opinion Felix 926 14 February 1992
'Out of the Blue'; a phrase of
surprise and unexpected
happenings. Maybe that's your
opinion about the Christian Union
at Imperial College. Surely science
and religion are ill matched
partners, always at each others'
throats. 'Well it's obviously like
that, as science is a study of the
physical whereas religion concerns
the spiritual and unprovable.'
Hmmm.. .I'm not sure about that.
Many great scientists thought
deeply about the religious aspects
Out of the Blue
Faraday being the obvious
examples.
However, science and religion
cannot seek to cover the same areas.
You would not ask a Christian to
design a bridge, nor would you
expect a chemist to answe'f the
question 'Why am I here?' through
their research. In the specifics, both
science and religion are bounded in
scope but no less true for that
condition.
It is in the 'big' questions of
existence that religion is necessary.
Man becomes nothing more than
a biotechnological robot, which
doesn't sound like fun to me.
On a day such as today, it is
topical to consider human love. In
such a context, if I am nothing more
than a robot what does love mean?
Just chemical imbalances in our
brain, or something meaningful and
valuable to man. as a personal
creature.
A personal God makes the
difference and gives us the only
foundation to base meaning in life.
Jon Jordan on
the new
Christian Union
event
of their work. Einstein's 'God does
not play dice' is perhaps the most
famous quotation Laplace had 'no
need for the hypothesis' (God) and
Darwin, despite evolution, never
became an atheist. In fact,
prominent scientific pioneers were
Christians, who saw no divorce
between the Church and the
laboratory: Newton, Maxwell and
Science can tell us about the
processes of living, how things
happen but not why.
The most far-reaching question
facing man today is 'Who am I?'.
This is so important as on such a
question is based either despair or
hope. If there is no personal God,
what does man have on which to fix
his own personality?
Colourful Philosophy
He cares for mankind, he sent his
son to live on earth, 2,000 years
ago, to die on earth and yet to defeat
death by his resurrection. If you
want answers to the big questions
that we all must answer, come along
to 'Out of the Blue' every lunchtime
except Wednesday in 213 Huxley.
Peter Woodcock will be talking
about Jesus, God, life and many
other things. There is also a talk
entitled 'Do all religions lead to
God?', especially for International
Students, on Friday night, 5.30pm
in Huxley 308. Free food provided.
Be surprised and weigh up the
evidence for yourself at 'Out of the
Blue'.
Read this purely as a possible colour
scheme, to the world you have
already drawn.
An observer (O) perceives some
part of a universe. The perceptions
that that observer has are a property
of that observer. A region of that
universe is thus in duplicate. O
version I will call Reality the other
O-Space. Everything O knows
about that universe comes from his
perceptions—Reality and O-space
never intersect. O-space is however
a function of Reality through the
process of observation; O can never
know this. O knows about O-space
and must therefore observe it.
O thinks about O-space. O finds
that everything neatly fits into units
with no left overs, each with a
name. Large units contain smaller
units on closer examination and the
reverse. O imagines in O-space a
large tree of connections between
each unit representing everything he
knows. Some units exist only in
time like read-but then time is only
another unit. O imagines his
thoughts as a journey through the
tree.
O investigates observation. O
finds that observers have a brain in
which groups of cells simplify
messages in situations where the
observer must be observing. O also
finds that some machines can be
made to behave a little like
observers. O believes that the
groups of cells can be associated
with the units in O-space.
O is troubled that the brain does
not have all the diversity and colour
of O-space but then O remembers
that he can only see a brain in O-
space. He reflects that likewise
perhaps a real universe has more
diversity and colour than O-space
and a greater form than his lifeless
tree.
