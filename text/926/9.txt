The Favour, the Watch and the
Very Big Fish
"Oh Dear'; said the lady sitting next
to me as the film ended. The Big
Bronze Bap was likely to agree.
According to the promo, the film
was an 'off beat romantic comedy
featuring a cast of eccentric and
bizarre characters'. Oh yeah? Guess
whose nose just grew 3 feet.
Yum! Sinus problems.
Being fair and looking at its
promises,
Bizarre? Yes.
Eccentric? All right, yes.
Romantic? A snog or two.
Comedy? Sigh,....,hum...
Although it only lasts 8-9
minutes, it seemed to drag, not a
drag which would be in 17' tall
neon letters and adjoining a grill and
tapas bar, but a vaguely tedious,
alright to see on the telly drag.
The main character is our Bob
Hoskins, Louis Aubinard, a
devotional photographer who has to
find a model for 'The Epic Christ
on the Cross Scene' or bye bye job,
hello unemployment and eating cat
food city. He finds himself standing
in for an actor friend at a dub-over
session, at, get this, a porno studio,
wacky huh? This is where the
romance comes in, no, not the
porno film Flame or I like it up the
bum, oh you're so big inside me
©Steve W! but his co-actress, Sybil
(Natasha Richardson). Actually I
much preferred her in the Ken
Russell film Gothic, now there's a
film with a good bap, breast and
blood count, four stars, the BBB
says, check it out anyway. Louis
falls headlong for Sybil (willy long
as well) and she for him (but not so
much of the willy).
As the day progresses she reveals
(ooer) her past (only her past) to
Louis and her abortive romance to
the Pianist, aborted only by her
enslavement to a diabolical
violinist. Argh. (This is the bit
where the favour and watch come
into play). But, and there's where
the plot thickens, the Pianist is due
The Crucible
Salem, Massachusets, 1662: A
town of Puritans, mostly farmers
and landowners. They live a quiet
life of hard work and prayer. The
bible rules. A group of girls are
caught dancing in the woods at night
with a slave from Barbados
practising voodoo rites. This causes
turmoil. A court is adjourned, and
the accused have the choice of
confessing and accusing others or
being hanged.
This is basically the story of
Arthur Miller's The Crucible,
which is playing at the Young Vic
Theatre. Although the play has lost
its immediate topicality-
McCarthy's Un-American
Activities Committee—it is still a
good enough play to make you
shiver for the cold logic with which
• people are hanged even after the
trials have become an apparent
farce. The play is produced by the
Young Vic Youth Theatre
Company, which gives 15-25 year
old amateurs the opportunity to
actively learn about theatre. Not
surprisingly then the quality of the
acting ranges from amazing to poor,
but the production's major flaw is
a sloppy direction (by Karen
Stevens and Chris White). There is
not enough differentiation between
most characters and hardly any
capacity was allowed for a climax.
Right from the opening scene,
everybody is panicking, rarely can
one sense the solemnity of the
puritans. Many chilling lines are
lost in the overall tumult.
out of the very prison he was put
into for attacking the violinist,
tomorrow. Louis ends up meeting
the Pianist, who, surprise, slap my
thigh, is the perfect Christ.
Yippeee! The plot holds together.
Unfortunately the Pianist starts
believing his own divinity, does
some dodgy miracles whilst trying
to kill Syb and Louis, Louis
meanwhile is trying to find Syb and
oh it's a mixed up world and no
mistake. Since it's a romance Syb
and Louis end up snogging.
But as it was a comedy, where
were all the jokes? Lots at the
beginning and funny ones too,
humping goats etc, lots that were
subtle too and good throwaway
lines (what sort of fish is that? A
very big one.).
Being technical, the camera work
is first class with shots of Paris that
you don't normally see as a tourist.
There again, as the film just wasn't
funny enough, no matter of good
character work, excellent shots and
bizarre scenarious could make up
for that fact.
If I'd paid £6 to see it, the Big
' Bronze Bap would not be happy,
although I'd still try to nick a poster
from the undergound.
Vital statistics: Baps zero, breasts
nil. blood no pints, no car chases,
no fights or chopsocky; one star.
Trie Big Bronze Bap says don't
pay £6 to see it.

The Roaring
Girl's Hamlet
Imagine an all women performance
of Hamlet! That's what The
Roaring Girl's Hamlet is, produced
by Sphink (ex Women's Theatre
Group). There is a little frame story
to explain the unusual cast. It makes
them rough girls from the London
underworld of 1605, who, staging
a play, break the law in an
emanzipatory act. But this does not
hurt the show at all.
Original stage props and
costumes, highly theatrical lighting
and brilliant acting on most parts
make this slimmed down three hour
version of Hamlet quite an
experience. As for the acting I
should mention they have an
incredibly funny Polonius, and
Hamlet—well I guess you just have
to see her. So what is the effect of
an all feminine cast? Well, after the
action had started, it didn't really
strike me anymore. What remained
was a weird sensation that
something ain't right, which goes
quite well with the play. Go see it.
The only drawback: It's in
Croydon.
The Roaring Girl's Hamlet by
Spinx at the Warehouse Theatre
Company, right next to East
Croydon BR, until 23 Feb. For
