14 February 1992 Felix 926 Clubs & Societies
Ballroom Dance Champions
Saturday 1st February, saw the start
of the first of the three annual
university dancing competitions.
The Imperial College Dance Club
took three teams - each team
containing a waltz, cha cha,
quickstep and jive couple - to the
Sheffield University Intervarsity
Dancing Competition held at the
Sheffield Octagon.
After a coach journey made most
adventurous by zero visibility fog
followed by getting lost in the hills
and valleys of Sheffield (I told them
it was junction 33 but noooo!...) we
arrived at the Octagon where we
were joined by 40 other university
teams, amongst them our long time
rivals, Cambridge and Oxford (we
love them really).
First off were the team
competitions. Imperial was the only
university in the finals of each of the
four dances. The waltz saw Nigel
and Juliette to the third round, but
a commendable performance by
Norman and Clare took them into
the semi-finals, where the sheer
gracefulness of Colin and Joanne
justified their tie for second place.
Despite stiff competition in the
Latin section, Pragnesh and
Lyeyen, new to the competition
scene, survived up to the third
round of the cha cha while a most
wicked performance from our two
other couples Mathew and Zoe and
Paul and Sonia carried them to the
finals achieving 2nd and 3rd place
respectively.
Good dancing by Joe and Sarah
helped them to the third round of
the quickstep. However, new
comers Peter and Susan
quickstepped comfortably to the
semis, but Head and Patricia,
through a smooth and enjoyable
dance, secured third place.
Of the five couples in the finals
of the jive, three were from
Imperial. In a strong jive, Satin and
Liz just missed a place in the finals
but a titillating show from Roger
and Helen gave them fifth position.
However a truly awe inspiring
performance from Alex and
Shelagh and Mark and Max
deservedly gained them 1st and 3rd
places respectively.
After a stunning demonstration
from British world champions
Sammy Stopford and Barbera
Maccall, the university knockout
competition commenced. This
simply entailed two randomly
chosen universities competing
against each other in two randomly
chosen dances, with the winner
proceeding to the following round.
Imperial battled relentlessly to the
final round, leaving in its path a
damaged York University and
Oxford to pick up the pieces of
defeat. .
In the finals we met none other
than Cambridge. They stared at us
and us at them, our feet tense and
ready for the mother of all dances.
And then the shouting match
started, 'Imperial', 'Cambridge',
'Imperial', 'Cambridge', T C . . . but
what were the dances? Waltz and
Quickstep! We hurled Colin and
Joanne, our strongest waltz couple,
onto the floor and Cambridge sent
on their finest and in the blink of
an eye it was finished. Then Head
and Patricia glided on for the
quickstep and it too was over in a
flash - but who won? The room was
silent as the judges tabulated the
scores and then it was announced...
'The winners are Imperial
College!!'.
At the end of the evening the
overall results showed us barely
losing the C-team trophy but
comfortably winning the B and A-
team trophies, making us the overall
winners. There can be no rest
however as the Southern University
Competition is just a week away
and Cambridge, Oxford and a
dozen other hopefuls will be there
bent on revenge. Special thanks to
out team coaches Vicky and
Dorothy, without whom this victory
would not have been possible.
Ladies' Lawn Tennis Women's Cross
Sara (captain), Carol, Marianne
and Kirsten made up the IC Ladies
Lawn Tennis team of four that were
virtually unrivalled in the round
robin area group of the U A U
Championship, and qualified in
second place behind Reading. Our
first match in the Knock-Out stages
was against Bognor at home. After
waiting for an hour at Bishop's Park
courts, it was obvious that Bognor
were too scared to turn up. They
must have heard about our Saturday
pre-match training session, where
miraculously, all four members
turned up for the first time ever. We
claimed a walk-over, thus resulting
in our next match being away to
Cardiff, who had won their group.
Three of us set off from South
Kensington Tube Station at 8am and
met our fourth player at
Paddington. If we were feeling a
little sleepy, we soon woke up at the
cost of the train fare. Undaunted,
we managed to reach the tennis
courts with 45 minutes to spare. So
using our feminine charm (what
from IC?) we bribed the
groundsman to unlock the courts so
we could have a little practise.
The opposition turned up late and
in awe of our ability. After the 4
singles matches, the score in
matches was a 2-2 tie, but with us
leading 3-2 in sets. Kirsten at seed
4 played valiantly, but lost in
straight sets (to who we considered
to be their best player!). Marianne
at seed 3, narrowly lost in a 3 set
'match of the day' battle. Carol
(seed 2) won convincingly against
a mouthy opponent. First seed Sara
won in her usual style, by beating
her opponent with ease.
Going into the doubles, we
needed to win one of the two
doubles matches without the loss of
a set, to guarantee winning the
match. Marianne and Kirsten lost
their match, but Sara and Carol
ensured victory by winning in
straight sets. Overall we won by
one set, 7-6. This put us through to
the quarter final stages.

On Wednesday February 5th, the
IC Ladies Cross Country team won
the London University League
competition which was held at
Richmond Park. This was actually
an amazing feat considering there
was a team at all. Imperial hasn't
had a ladies team for eons. As a
group, the team was relatively new
to the circuit, but this was not
apparent to the flagging opposition.
The course covered a gruelling 2.75
miles on a windswept plateau above
Richmond and was a test of both
stamina and grit. However this
proved no bar to the success of
Edwige Pitel who came second,
Mana Raimandi who came fifth and
Kristina Sewple who came seventh
out of a field of approximately 35.
On Tuesday evening (18th
February) IC Chamber Orchestra
will be giving its first concert of the
year. The programme consists of
the 'Overture From The Magic
Flute' by Mozart, Beethovens
Second Symphony and the Tuba
concerts by Vaughn-Williams. The
soloist will be Joseph Izod - a
member of the symphony orchestra
and a final year student of the Royal
Academy of Music.

This is not the first time the girls
have been successful, since two
weeks ago at Trent Park they again
tasted victory. They did this by
finishing in 1st, 3rd and 7th places
in the same respective order.
If there is anyone out there who
feels like jumping on the
bandwagon of success, the team
needs another girl to run in the IC
organised Hyde Park Relays (racing
around the Serpentine) on the 15th
February. There are lots of other
exciting events happening soon as
well, such as a road relay at Oxford
University and even a race in Paris
at the end of March. If anyone is
interested they should contact
Kristina (Chem 2) via the
Chemistry pigeon holes.
