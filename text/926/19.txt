place, with S T A C K playing for
pride (and bragging points, if they
beat their first team) against a PLOP
team looking for maximum points.
It was all over (a mere) seven
minutes later. Five matches, five
wins for PLOP. And a little silver-
coloured thingy for the glass
cabinet.
And so plop were the day's
golden boys, and S T A C K the
rubber chickens. Congratulations
however to both teams whose
personnel managed to get out of bed
at such an abnormal hour, and miss
the rugby just to get muddy and in
some cases, get an interesting paint
job.
1st PLOP (Imperial 1) 50 pts
2nd UCL 34 pts
3rd STACK (Imperial 2) 30 pts
4th Shene 24 pts
5th Northampton 1 pt

The Arts Week
Honourable mentions to Luke for
drawing blood (and not his own),
Gary for courage in the face of
adversity (and constant ridicule),
Leo for hogging all the flag grabs,
Brendan and Matt for being in the
right place at the right time (all the
time), and Andy for the impressive
(yawn) speech.
Sunday March 1st, 1992 will see
the Official Student Tournament
near Portsmouth. Imperial will be
sending a team to dispossess
Portsmouth Poly of the title they've
had for two years running. Watch
this space!
'You want fame... well fame costs;
and right here's where you start
paying... in sweat.' You've seen it
happen at the New York Centre For
The Performing Arts: now believe
it can happen at IC.
Bring back those leg warmers of
the 80's - 'The Arts Week' is soon
to hit IC. We are calling all you
Leroys and Dorises. Can you busk,
sing, dance, juggle, clown - alone
or in groups? Can you do a sausage
slapping dance, play a comb and
paper, make up nice tunes on you
PC? Do you have a dancing bear?
If you do anything artistic and
entertaining and you want to bring
C A R N I V A L to technoland this
term, get in touch with me asap.
Offers for those willing to groove
on stationary cabs on Exhibition
Road will be accepted! (Confused?
You obviously weren't a dedicated
viewer.)
Don't know what 'The Arts
Week' is? Keep your ear to the
ground - you'll soon find out! For
more details contact the cheerful
blonde: Toni Briggs, West London
Chaplaincy, Basement, 10 Prince
Gardens, Ext 8633.
Tt didn't look
too hard. Like
shooting fish in
a barrel. '
And all for 'a
little silver
coloured thingy
for the glass
cabinet'
