Hunting
Elephants
Mathematicians hunt elephants
by going to Africa, throwing out
everything that is not an elephant,
and catching whatever is left.
Experienced mathematicians will
attempt to prove the existence of at
least one unique elephant before
proceeding to step 1, as a
subordinate exercise. Professors of
mathematics will prove the
existence of at least one unique
elephant and their graduate
students.
Computer scientists hunt
elephants by exercising Algorithm
A:
1. Go to Africa.
Chapter 13.
Musician. The
latest in the
Troy Tempest
saga. Will it
never end?
2. Start at the Cape of Good Hope.
3. Work northward in an orderly
manner, traversing the continent
alternatively east and west.
4. During each traverse pass
(a) Catch each animal seen.
(b) Compare each animal caught
to a known elephant.
(c) Stop when match is detected.
Experienced computer
programmers modify Algorithm A
by placing a known elephant in
Cairo to ensure that the algorithm
will terminate. Assembly language
programmers prefer to execute
Algorithm A on their hands and
Stress watched as attendants
manouevred amplifiers in an eight
foot ring around the electric guitar,
boxing it in a wall of noise. Behind
this circle of lights and power a
drummer began to rhythmically,
pound his drums, sending shudders
through the floor as he roused the
beast from its slumbers. Perched on
a stand under the spotlight the
electric guitar's spiky body, neck
and head seemed to stir and the
cable connecting it to the amps
shaked restlessly.
Behind Stress the guards pulled
Mercy Killing on to the stage and
shoved him towards the circle of
power. Sweating with terror the
prisoner looked up to the crowds
clustered around the balcony and
then at the monster in the ring he
had to fight. Clenching his fists he
strode forward to battle.
The guitar howled as Mercy
grabbed it from the stand and put
the holding strap around him, there
to prevent the guitar escaping.
Removing a plectrum dagger from
his pocket Mercy grabbed the neck
and pressed his fingers down on the
fretboard to play a D. Wincing from
the pain of the steel wires he struck
the strings with the plectrum.
Howls of pain noise erupted from
knees.
Engineers hunt elephants by
going to Africa, catching grey
animals and stopping when any one
of them weighs within plus or minus
15 per cent of any previously.,
observed elephants.
Economists don't hunt elephants,
but they blieve that if elephants are
paid enough, they'll hunt
themselves.
Statisticians hunt the first animal
they see in time and call it an
elephant.
Consultants don't hunt elephants,
and many have never hunted
anything at all, but they can be hired
by the hour to adivse those people
who do. Operations research
consultants can also measure the
correlation of hat size and bullet
colour to the efficiency of elephant
hunting strategies, if someone else
will only identify the elephants.
Politicians don't hunt elephants,
but will share the elephants you
catch with the people who voted for
them.
Lawyers don't hunt elephants,
but they do follow herds around
arguing about who owns the
dropping. Software lawyers will
claim that they own an entire herd
based on the look and feel of one
dropping.
the speakers as the guitar bucked
and groaned from the stroke. Hope
was in Mercy's face, knowing that
two more major chords would be
enough to quell the beast in his
hands. He switched his hands to a
C shape but that's when the guitar
struck. Feeding power to its strings
it forced the player to make a
seventh and then, his face racked
with fear, Mercy started playing
solo, his fingers dancing up the
fretboard under the control of the
animal. Faster and faster his fingers
danced until, falling to his knees in
pain, he screamed aloud as the
guitar forced his fingers to play a
high C.
The crowd groaned aloud as the
cackling guitar was returned to its
stand and the broken player was
dragged aside, blood streaming
from his lacerated fingers.
'NOW STRESS M U S T P L A Y ! '
The guards unlocked him,
dragged him and pushed him into
the ring. In the glare of the
spotlight, Stress looked across at the
black shining creature, its smooth
finish marred only by the faint
streaks of blood on the fretboard.
Inside him the military chemical
support gland once again received
the call to arms.
Vice-presidents of engineering,
research and development try hard
to hunt elephants, but their staffs are
designed to prevent it. When the
vice-president does get to hunt
elephants, the staff will try to ensure
that all possible elephants are
completly pre-hunted before the
vice-president sees them. If the
vice-president does see a non pre-
hunted elephant, the staff will
1. Compliment the vice-president's
keen eyesight, and
2. Enlarge itself to prevent any
recurrence
Senior managers set broad elephant
hunting policy based on the
assumption that elephants are just
like big field mice, but with deeper
voices. Quality assurance inspectors
ignore the elephants and look for
mistakes the other hunters made
when they were packing the jeep.
Salespeople don't hunt elephants,
but spend their time selling the
elephants they haven't caught, for
delivery two days before the season
opens. Software salespeople ship
the first thing they catch and write
up an invoice for an elephant.
Hardware salespeople catch rabbits,
paint them grey, and sell them as
desktop elephants.
Picking up the plectrum dagger
from the floor Stress strode over to
the stand and pulled the guitar from
its holder. Feedback yowls swam
around him as he pulled the guitar
holding strap over his shoulders and
swung the instrument around.
Gripping the strings Stress struck a
D chord. The guitar spat its anger
and tried to move his fingers. Stress
strode to the nearest amp and thrust
the guitar before the speakers. The
guitar howled and groaned with the
pain and Stress took the chance and
struck a C , battering the guitar
repeatedly with this chord until, his
hands cut with steel, he hit the third
chord.
The sound echoed around the
room, soon being drowned by the
cheers of the prisoners. Stress
dropped the plectrum and played a
soft chord with his fingers. The
battered guitar, surprised at this, let
his fingers play some more notes.
It responded to his touch and Stress
began playing a light tune. The
gallery was in uproar, the crowd
beginning to chant.
'Play! Play!'
Stress took the guitar holder off,
sat on a stool and played music to
the audience, the guitar responded
happily to his fingers. The prisoners
clapped along and then with a
flourish Stress finished the
instrumental and lapped up the
applause.
And then the roof caved in.
