Do Students Plop
On the 1st February 1992, two of
History's most one-sided contests
since Agincourt and Kuwait
occurred in Twickenham and
Effingham Junction (that's in
Surrey, for all our Northern
subscribers). While M r Carling's
lot were pounding the shamrocks
out of our Celtic cousins, Imperial's
paintball teams, PLOP (IC 1st XII)
and S T A C K (IC 2nd XII) were
locked in combat (literally) for the
Flying Colours' 3rd Annual
University Cup (actually, not so
much a cup as a little silver-
coloured thingy).
Present on the day were six teams
- U C L , Luton, Northampton, Shene
(where the heck is that?) and the
two IC squads. U C L were back to
defend'their cup with only eight
men (does that make them confident
or just plain dumb?), while the other
colleges were relative newcomers
to the game. That made IC hot
favourites to not only win, but to
sweep the top placings.
And so battle commenced. PLOP
started in great style, deluxing their
opposition in their first three
matches in a combined total time of
about 17 minutes, for a total loss of
five men. S T A C K held their own
in such company, with a 100%
record (3 matches, 3 wins) going
into lunch.
It was all building up to a grand
finale. PLOP won their penultimate
match without loss in a mere 3
minutes. That meant PLOP vs
STACK as the final match to decide
1st and 2nd places, but only if
S T A C K could beat U C L . Twelve
men against six (two guns had since
packed up). It didn't look too hard.
Like shooting fish in a barrel.
But the fish shot back! U C L
stunningly reversed the expected
outcome, despite being reduced to
two men (against eight). The flag
was hung, and it wasn't UCL's. In
the words of the U C L captain, 'they
played like shite'. And so U C L
guaranteed themselves second
Abortion Talk
This Thursday (20th February) at
12.45pm in the Union SCR,
ProLife Soc is hosting this years
SPUC Youth & Student Division
Lecture Tour, at which all are
welcome. The topic is
'Developments on RU486' and the
speaker is Catherine Francoise.
Some of our committee have
previously seen Catherine speak at
Blackpool, so we can safely say that
the talk will be both lively and
informative.
RU486 is an abortifacient drug
designed to replace surgical
abortion and has recently been
licensed for trials in the U K .
However there are grave doubts
over its safety, let alone its
advantages over surgery. Its
suitability for the Third World is
also dubious, although this is the
huge market almost certainly
targeted by its manufacturers. If
you'd like to hear more about
RU486 and how you can help
prevent another disaster on the scale
of Opren or Thalidomide, come
along to the talk on Thursday.
