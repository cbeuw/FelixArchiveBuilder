Booked Security Change Collared
The library of University College,
London, may close for an extra two
days a week if cuts in funding are
implemented. Alternatives to part
time closure include the complete
shutdown of departmental libraries,
moving their contents to the central
library, and a reduction in
periodical buying. It is reported that
the College does not think it gets
'value for money' from the library,
though the library refutes this.

London)
A new system of security is to be
implemented in the Union Building.
Currently, one duty officer must be
on duty every weekday evening,
with extra officers as card checkers
on Wednesdays and Fridays.
It has been decided that there
were not enough officers to provide
adequate coverage this week, so
from Monday next week the ICU
Union Office Sabbaticals, Zoe'
Hellinger, Steve Farrant and
Jonathan Griffiths will be on duty
on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday
evenings. On Wednesdays, three
officers will be on duty, two for
checking union cards and one to act
as a normal duty officer. On a
Friday there will be an additional
officer on duty and weekend
security will only change when
large numbers are expected in the
Union Building.
Vacancies are available for new
duty officers, who along with
current officers will be given special
security training by the police.
Sid Sofos, the instructor of ICU
Wing Chun society, was arrested on
Wednesday 12 February on two
charges of indecent exposure. He
was given unconditional bail for 21
days by Horseferry Road
Magistrates Court and his trial will
take place on 27 February.
Dire
Reading University Students Union
(RUSU) is in dire financial straits
after announcing that it has a budget
deficit of over £300,000. Suspicion
is pointed at the former RUSU
Finance Manager who authorised
great expenditure without there
being enough money to cover it.
The deficit has been partly offset by
loan from the University of
£100,000, which may lead to
greater interference by the
University in Union spending.

Jobs Up Cycle Code
There are signs that the job market
for graduates are slowly improving,
according to a .report in the
Independent this week. It maintains
that the slight improvement will not
offset the 20% reduction in
recruitment that occurred last year.
The report says also that the
sponsorship of students has fallen
dramatically. See the career's
information on page 22.
Fat Max
Imperial College Students' Union
has requested that the Governing
Body of the College remove Robert
Maxwell's honorary fellowship.
The fellowship was given in 1989
because of his association with
Pergamon Press, one of Britain's
most successful scientific
publishers. It was hotly contested
and the award was only given after
a vote of the Governing Body.
The Rector, Sir Eric Ash, said
that the removal of the award would
attract adverse publicity to a bad
decision. The Governing Body
responded to the Union request by
stating that as M r Maxwell was
dead the award could not be taken
away from him.
Resigned
Richard Eyers resigned as ICU
Publications Board Chairman last
week after what he described as
'petty bickering' in the Union that
had got to a 'ludicrous' stage. He
said that the events surrounding the
theft of Felix the week before last
left him in a position where he felt
unable to continue. M r Eyers has
held the post for two years. The
only candidate for his replacement
is be David Henderson-Begg,
STOIC Business Manager, and new
election is also standing.
For three days Imperial College
students can have their cycles
security coded for free. The coding
will take place in the Anteroom of
the Sherfield Building refectory
today (Friday), Monday and
Tuesday between 10.00am and
4.00pm, with a break from
12.30pm until 2.00pm.
Access Up
Over one thousand three hundred
students have applied for the
£160,000 available in Access Funds

Mr Cullen told Felix that those

(RSMU) office was broken into by
members of King's College on
Friday 8th February. During the

there would be those who would not

important that the whole form be
returned so that the number of
student beds required could be
calculated. She added that there was
nothing to be gained by students
holding back the forms
unnecessarily. 'We need students to
help us to help them,' she said.
