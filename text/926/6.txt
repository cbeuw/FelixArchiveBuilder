Lloyd Cole: The Shirt!
Paul Daniels' Magic Box
This is much more like it. This
week is an absolute stormer.
Nothing tonight, of any great note,
mind. Wendy Page at the
Hammersmith Swan, Shorter Than
Miles in the oT union lounge. Steve
Farrant, a man who knows his
music (especially pianos) describes
them as 'hot acid jazz' elsewhere in
this issue, and as Felix has to agree
with everything any union sadbo
does or says, I suppose they must
be good, and the Sultans Of Ping
FC.
But seeing as it is St. Valentine's
Day, you're all off out with your
loved ones, aren't you? I shouldn't
have said that, should I? I've now
You think I'm going to slag this,
don't you? You think I'm going to
tear it limb from limb, rip its guts
out and eat its inner intestines for
breakfast. And still be hungry for
more, and so have a quick snack of
kidney for a sort of brunch type
meal. Preconceptions can be a
dangerous thing. I was going to,
actually, but I'm feeling in a general
good will to the world sort of mood
today. I was going to slag it for
being superficial, and just a, no
doubt expensive, marketing ploy by
Polydor in order to sell our Lloyd

lost half of you who have just
rushed out of the lecture theatre and
off to Kensington High St. to try
and find something for the "better"
half before he/she/it finds out
you've forgotten. Oh, well. On with
the show.
The> Sultans Of Ping FC feature
heavily this week. They're playing
on Saturday too, just for those of
you who did remember to book a
restaurant before I wrote this. And
for those of you unaware of them,
you need to wear a football shirt,
and lie on your back waving your
feet in the air. Enough said about
them, I think.
Tuesday. Now your decision
shouldn't be too difficult here.
lnspiral Carpets. 2nd worst live
band on the planet, Airhead, worst
live band on the planet, and Pele,
really quite good, just to ruin
things.
Or alternatively, World Of Twist
are playing at the Camden Palace.
1 suppose, if your feeling rich (ie:
didn't have to spend all your cash
on Valentines) you could go and see
Pele and then mosey along down to
the Palace.
Nutmeg at the Borderline. Worth
it if you can't get into the Palace.
The support band have a lovely
name too.
Wednesday. The Joshua Trio.
Absolutely wonderful live. Go and
see them.
Love and a special valentine kiss.

to the 'youth' market.
But so what? I don't care if they
want to spend money on remixing
Lloyd. It could be considered a
public service. It might get a
government grant, for the good of
the community, and all that. And it
does actually sound quite good. No,
really. A radical ('radical' is
underlined in the press release, so
I thought it wise to put 'radical' in
the review a few times.) remix by
someone called Adam Peters. It's
probably so 'radical' that it hasn't
actually been anywhere near Lloyd.
Just as well, I guess. It's really quite
'radically' pleasant, for Lloyd that
is.
