Barton Fink
Now, how the hell do I class this
film, it's completely genre-less, and
there's nothing I've seen that can at
a hope even hint to this filmy
weirdness, I'm telling you, the
writers (Joe and Ethan Coen) were
on mushrooms when they dreamt
this little baby up.
Anyway, about the plot, plot,
• yeah,...tricky one that, you see, it's
more of an experience than a plot,
intertwined with a real plot and
oodles of confusion (sounds
weird—you should see the film!).
Well, let's have a stab
anyway,...picture a man going on
a journey beyond sight and sound,
he's left New York (where he
enjoyed overnight fame for his new
play, a celebration of the common
man), he's entered, Hollywood,
dah, dah, daaaahhh. It's 1941 and
Barton Fink (John Turturro) is
offered a screen-writing contract,
\ ' a d r i f t
he sets aside his qualms about
pandering to a mass audience and
moves to L A , where as a
concession to his social conscience,
he checks into a rather seedy hotel.
There, during a brutal heatwave, he
My Girl
struggles to carry out his first
assignment for the studio, despite
a terminal case of writer's block and
the intrusions of his neighbour, (not
your run of the mill Ramsey Street
kind mind you) an affable, talkative
salesman named Charlie Meadows
(John Goodman) who seems to
embody the virtues of the common
man.
The Coen brothers wrote Barton
Fink while stricken with writer's
block during the writing of Miller's
Crossing (a gangster drama set in
the twenties), so they must know
what they're talking about, they
certainly know how to bring the
best out of Turturro, who gives an
oustanding performance, as does
Goodman.
Oh, special metnion must go to
the Film's soundtrack, which I think
is unsurpassed in creating
atmosphere, apparently there are
only 20 bars of music in the whole
film, with only rhythmic section
coming when Fink finally begins to
write and you can hear the
percussion instruments grooving to
the typewriter strokes.
A great movie, which has too
many surprises to keep you sane,
and will leave you exhausted and
utterly confused.

A Night at
Tunesia
Just recently the cinema has
succumbed to a phenomena that
seemed to have lain dormant since
the late forties.. The phenomena in
question is that of the 'child star'.
This last year has seen movies such
as Problem Child, Curly Sue and of
course Home Alone, sky-rocket
their young stars to unimaginable
fame and glory, as well as ensuring
their bank balances will remain in
a healthy state for quite some time,
(well, at least until they are in their
mid-teens).
Macauly Culkin, pint size star of
the aforementioned Home Alone,
now features in Howard Zeiff s new
movie My Girl. In this particular
movie however, Mr Culkin is not
the star, but provides support for
another young actress who I'm sure
will, (quite deservedly) go on to
greater things.
Eleven year-old newcomer, Anna
Chlumsky stars as Vada, a young
girl who lives with her widowed
father (Dan Aykroyd), and
eccentric grandmother in the funeral
home her father owns.
A hypochondriac, Vada is always
claiming to be suffering from one
of the ailments that plagued her
father's late clients, and it is not
until the entrance of Jamie Lee
Curtis (as the make-up artist who
doesn't know that she's going to be
working with the deceased), that
things really begin to change.
The movie chronicles one
particular summer in nineteen-
seventy-two, when Vada learns
about friendship, love, death,
growing up and the possibility that
Jamie Lee Curtis is going to be her
new mother.
The friendship between Vada and
her best friend Thomas J (Culkin),
is mirrored by the growing
relationship between Aykroyd and
Curtis, and so the scene is set for
a few nice comic moments, a touch
of genuine drama and a fairly
generous helping of 'sweetness'.
My Girl does suffer from some
rather over-sentimental scenes, but
it is nicely played with Chlumsky
demonstrating considerable talent,
and Mr Culkin (definitely not in his
'brat' persona), showing that
despite his youth, he does have
considerable skill as an actor. It's
difficult to know what sort of
audience My Girl is aimed at, as the
movie may be a touch too dramatic
for younger members of the
audience. Having said this
however, My Girl does make a
fairly entertaining night out for
couples and family alike.

A Night at Tunesia is the title of a
song by Dizzy Gillespie and of a
new play by Paul Sirett at the
Theatre Royal Stratford East. On
two parallel time levels, 60s and
90s, it tells the story of a jazz
musician that doesn't quite make it.
There is not much more to say
about the play, but the production
has some nice features: A very
slanted, askew stage, and nine live
jazz numbers. In all, go see it if you
want to see a light, showy play.
Including the travelcard, it is still
cheaper than your local Cannon.
Theatre Royal Stratford East,
Gerry Raffles Square, near
Stratford Station. Until Feb 29.
Tickets £3-12, concessions £2
bookable in advance. BO 081-534
0310.
