14 February 1992 Felix 926 Feature
pulled up at his brother's house, a
collection of rickety stone buildings
ringed by a complex maze of dry
stone walls. We had a breakfast
there of cups of salt tea and greasy
pancakes soaked in cooking oil. I
politely choked down the waves of
nausea that overcame me as my
enthusiastic host forced more and
more pancakes and oil down me. I
was grateful when I was allowed to
stop eating.
A few hours later we arrived in
the village of Gupis, a small
conglomeration of the usual dry
stone huts clinging to the banks of
the Gilgit River. I bought the driver
another cup of salt tea and he
explained to me that he had heard
of some stones similar to the ones
that I was seeking a further 10km
upstream on the other side of the
river. I thanked him and he told me
to be outside the village shop at
7.00am the next morning if I
wanted a lift back to Gilgit.
I set off along the riverside road
surrounded by tall beech trees
cloaked in autumnal browns and
yellows. After a two hour walk I
could see the village of Khalti on the
opposite bank, perched on the
narrow shelf of land below
precipitous brown cliffs. The river
here was deep and green and wide
and afforded the only crossing point
for some distance in either
direction. The crossing was carried
out on a rather sorry looking raft
built from a plank of wood and two
lorry innertubes. It was hauled from
bank to bank by two ropes and to
cross the river I had first to bargain
with the rope puller on the other
side. This was done by means of an
agent who screamed my offers of
payment over the river where they
were at first met with howls of
derisive laughter. Eventually a fee
was agreed upon and I was floated
unsteadily across to Khalti.
It took me a further hour and a
half to explain to a group of curious
villagers what I was looking for.
Firstly I tried drawing pictures in
the sand but finally succeeded by
making a small model from
pebbles.
A reluctant guide was found and
together we trudged up into the
cliffs behind the village. My guide
spoke no English and set off at a
sprint which I struggled to keep up
with. I felt ashamed of my Italian
leather Vibram soled walking boots
as he powered ahead sockless in a
pair of cut off rubber Wellingtons
several sizes too big.
We climbed to a gently sloping
plane covered in brown sand and
black glazed rocks and from here
scrambled down a loose slope of
scree onto the spur of land at the
confluence of the Gilgit and Yassin
Rivers. There stood the stone circle,
lonely and almost daunting as the
incessant twisting crash of the rivers
wound around its large boulders,
smoothed by the constant flow of
water and stained brown by time.
It was possible to believe that the
perfect 8 metre circle was entirely
a creation of nature, that tiny
currents of water, breaths of air and
vibrations of the ground had
conspired over the millenia to give
birth to this monument.
In form the circle resembled a
table, the centre being solid and flat
stones having been arranged as a
top with large ones on the outside
edge dishing down to small ones in
the centre of the slightly concave
hollow. I took some pictures and
did a drawing but my guide was
obviously uneasy and kept urging
me to leave.
After a further half an hour I gave
in to my guide's, by now, frantic
sign language and we left this
curious site about which nothing is
known except that there are similar
ones further up the Yassin Valley.
The locals, however, have their
own ideas; as I was to find out later
that night.
Back in Khalti I paid my guide
and was immediately whisked off to
the house of Mohammed Ayub. He
was waiting for me as I walked into
the village. A tall, well built man
in his early thirties he spoke very
good English and insisted that I
come with him to drink tea.
As darkness fell I was invited to
stay the night and accepted
gratefully. Dinner was served next
to the big black iron stove with the
whole family in attendance but only
myself eating. As I spoke to
Mohammed his little brothers and
sisters ran around us shrieking and
yelling. Mohammed explained to
me quietly that the circle I had
visited was a very dangerous place
as a powerful demon called Mirza
Katchut lived there. The stove
blazed warmly as Mohammed's
father spoke through him to tell me
of how his own father had been
captured by the demon in the form
of a big black dog and imprisoned
inside the stones for a day before
he could escape.
As we spoke a small tape
blared out a continuous loop of the
'Dallas' theme tune. Mohammed
insited that I listen to Western music
and when I said that Pakistani music
was fine he just turned the volume
up.
An hour later, my ears still
ringing with American soap music,
I was shown to my bed. I layed
down and pulled the heavy quilt
over me and Mohammed's father
came and layed another four on top.
The weight was so much that I
could barely move beneath them but
I soon drifted off to sleep.
At 4.00am Mohammed shook me
awake and after breakfast had me
down to the river and on the raft so
I would have plenty of time in
which to get back to Gupis for my
ride to Gilgit.
The sky was still completely night
and as Mohammed pulled us across
the silent inky water I held a
paraffin lamp aloft like another star.
On the far side I said goodbye to
my host, we shook hands standing
on the impassive road and I began
to walk back through the dark.
After ten minutes I turned and
behind me I could see the bright
point of Mohammed's lamp in the
middle of the river- In front of me
the mountains were beginning to
rise from their slumber as the sun
began to gently brush them with
depth and colour.
Something caught my eye on the
slope to the right. I turned to see a
large black dog sitting on a rock.
It watched me walk to the sunrise
with unflinching eyes.
