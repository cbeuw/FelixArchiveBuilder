Han Mien Kho
and Abdul
Malek Said on
the Malaysian
Variety Show
'Flight MH 002'
'Selamat datang', directly
translated from the indigenous
Malay means 'welcome upon your
safe arrival', shows an extension of
Malaysian hospitality and
cordiality. For Malaysia itself is an
exquisite jewel of tropical paradise
and arguably the most beautiful
piece of land on earth. From coral
reefs and sun-bleached sands, to
white-water rapids and rubber
plantations; from surreal limestone
outcrops to pressure-cooker coastal
resorts..., you name it, we got it.
Sponsored by Malaysia Airlines,
Malaysian Society is for the second
time presenting the annual
Malaysian Variety Show, hence its
name 'Flight M H 002'. To
welcome you, we will serve you the
most exotic Malaysian cuisine. You
will be thrilled by 'Ayam Masak
Merah' (a traditional mild chicken
curry) with 'Nasi Minyak' (Rice
blended with herbs and oil). Also
you will find 'Acar' (preserved
vegetables) irresistable. Alongside
a wide range of other dishes,
including the vegetarian, we are
presenting authentic delicacies from
home, so don't mistreat yourself.
After the exhilarating meal, a
glance at the most sophisticated T V
screens at Subang International
Airport, Kuala Lumpur, you are
kindly requested to be on board
Flight M H 002 (Great Hall...!).
Carried by probably the fastest
supersonic jet, your flight to
London Heathrow Airport (i.e. the
show) is estimated to take two
hours. Treated as an honoured
guest, you are now on board one of
the most luxurious flights (let alone
the imagination). Instead of
showing you movies, we have
specially employed a cast of 30
Malaysians to give you a live
performance. You will be presented
with a series of most graceful and
spectacular traditional dances, a
rich and exuberant fashion show,
haunting tunes and sensational
sketches. So just sit back and relax,
and let us fill your senses to the
brim.
Together with special lighting
effects, our gifted musicians will
bring vitality to the night by a rather
lavish opening ceremony (details
are yet to be uncovered). Our 'state-
of-the-art' performances will
comprise three cultural dances,
namely 'Kuda Kepang', 'Ulek
Mayang' and 'Wau Bulan'. Kuda
Kepang is a traditional dance that
commemorates Javanese men who
spread the Islamic faith in the
interior land of Java. They rode on
horseback and told dramatic tales of
battles to attract the interest of
people. The dance is performed by
dancers astride 'two dimensional'
horses made of hide. They act out
some battle scenes. This very
dramatic dance form is
accompanied by the throbbing drum
beats of gongs, tambourines and
angklings (a percussion instrument
made from bamboo). The 'Ulek
Mayang' dance drama is probably
the most favourite dance amongst
the IC Malaysian students. This
dance visualises the romance
between a young fisherman and a
mystic procession. It begins with
seven fishermen going out to sea,
and one of them was killed in a
storm and his body subsequently
washed ashore. Seven mystic
princesses then appeared and
brought him back to life by their
magical powers. The next dance is
the 'Wau Bulan' (Moon kite).
'Wau' or kite flying is serious
business in the East Coast of
Malaysia. Some of these ceremonial
kites may be over ten feet in height!
They are made from bamboo and
paper and though heavily decorated,
are still aerodynamically feasible
and aesthetic. The Wau Bulan dance
is usually performed by the youth
as a pastime after the harvest. In
fact, the Wau Bulan also conceives
the supreme honour of being
selected as the logo of the national
air carrier, Malaysia Airlines.
Malaysia's rich cultural heritage
is evident in the colourful variety of
customs and festivals of different
ethnic groups who have their home
here. Lastly descendants of
immigrants from China, the Indian
Subcontinent and Sri Lanka,
together with the aboriginal Malay,
the people have gradually acquired
a distinct identity as Malaysians
while retaining their traditional
cultures, customs and festivals. For
a change of taste, we will be
demonstrating the ancient art of
Chinese calligraphy. But before
that, we like to tell you a
remarkable story behind it. In 1695,
a medical shop-keeper called Wang
Yi-young of the Shan Tung
Province in China discovered that
there were some cryptic inscriptions
engraved on the pieces of bones that
he was selling. He probably never
knew that those inscriptions are in
fact what we now know as the
earliest forms of Chinese writing.
They are part of the archives of the
Shang royal house, the first
historical dynasty (1500-1027BC),
and comprise questions put to the
oracle through the mediumship of
priests-scribes-diviners, together
with the oracular verdicts. Three
and a half thousand years has
elapsed since then, Chinese
calligraphy too, has transformed
tremendously. This is chiefly due to
the advances in technology and
increasingly flourished schools of
thought of the scholars. Here we
will perform Xing Shu—the most
