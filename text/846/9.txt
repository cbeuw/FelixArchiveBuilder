The results of exhaustive epidemiological studies
since 1950 have amply demonstrated the causal
association between cigarette smoking and cancer of
the lung. In initial retrospective studies, in which
smoking habits of known lung cancer patients were
ascertained and compared with control groups, it was
shown that the proportion of patients who were non-
smokers was extremely small (about 1 %) while more
than half had been heavy smokers over a number of
years. Prospective studies, in which populations were
first characterised in terms of tobacco usage and the
appearance of lung cancer then followed for a number
of years, were even more conclusive. The risk of
developing lung cancer was up to thirty times greater
in smokers than non-smokers, and was proportional
to the number of cigarettes smoked and the duration
of the smoking habit. By giving up smoking, the risk
could be very much reduced. The mortality in different
age groups at various smoking levels is shown in table
A. The risks involved in pipe or cigar smoking were
very much less than from cigarettes and only about
twice that of non-smokers. Cigar and pipe smokers,
however, run a considerably higher than average risk
of cancer of the lip or oral cavity.
Other aspects of the epidemiology of lung cancer
could also be correlated with cigarette smoking. Lung
cancer has increased dramatically in the last fifty
years and this can be wholly correlated with increased
cigarette consumption. In the UK the death rate for
males in the 65-75 age group rose from 36 per
100,000 in 1935 to 650 per 100,000 in 1973. As
a result of the long latency in the development of lung
cancer the mortality rates in any particular period
correlate most closely with the 'per capita'
consumption of cigarettes twenty years previously.
This is particularly well illustrated by the upward trend
of lung cancer in women which began in the 1960's
and has continued at a faster rate of increase than in
males. In the UK it was unusual for women to smoke
before about 1920, and the main increase in women
smokers began in the 1940s. After a lag of twenty
years, lung cancer began to rise rapidly in women.
The incidence of lung cancer varies around the
world, having its highest incidence in the UK where
it carries a higher mortality than any other tumour.
This variation may be accounted for by the differences
in the types of tobacco used in the manufacture of
cigarettes in different countries.
The association between smoking and cancer is
thus very strong and is most probably the result of
the carcinogenic substances in tobacco tar. However,
whilst about 10% of heavy smokers die of lung cancer
others survive to an advanced age without developing
the disease. Cigarette smoking may not, therefore, in
itself be a sufficient cause of lung cancer in the
absence of some other predisposing influence in the
individual. A genetic influence is one possibility and
there is evidence for both familial incidence of lung
cancer which is independent of cigarette smoking, as
well as an iherited tendency to be a smoker or
non-smoker.
