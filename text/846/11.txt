Groans at loans
by Neil McCluskey
Imperial College Union has policy that it thinks loans
are a bad idea. It is my duty to abide by that policy
and formulate campaigns to try and stop the
introduction of loans. This job is made much easier
by the fact that I am personally dead set against the
proposals put in the White Paper.
My personal reasons for being against the loans are
on the basis that when the loans come in the standard
of living for a student falls well below the minimum
standard that the Government believes itself (i.e.
either somebody on the Youth Training Scheme (YTSI
or an unemployed person). The figures opposite show
the drop in standard.
Even this example is grossly understated. Rent in
London is usually higher than £50 and travel costs are
certainly higher. So ignoring the fact that the
Government wishes students to pay for themselves,
the total funds available are not even adequate.
My job is to inform you how to go about stopping
the White Paper turning into legislation. At the time
of reading the White Paper will be in the House of
Commons going through what will probably be its final
discussion period before being published as a Bill to
be introduced in the coming year. Once introduced as
a Bill (which could feasibly be Monday if the
Government rushed it!!) it will receive its second
reading and will go off to committee for amendment.
It is important that some action is taken immediately
so that ideas are put forward for amendment. I believe
the only way to stop this scheme is to put reasoned
arguments forward to amend the Bill and thus delay
it. If the Bill is delayed for a period of as little as two
months the Government will find it virtually impossible
to pass the Bill and implement the the necessary
infrastructure to enact the Bill. The Government is
unlikely to reintroduce the Bill immediately prior to
election time!!
As you read this, a number of Union Council
members will be attending the debate in the House
of Commons and pulling out their local MPs to put
LOANS-COMPARATIVE INCOME EXAMPLES
1. Single person aged 18 on YTS scheme

rent, £5.25 rates £0.75 water rates). Pays £6 travel, £3 of
which is refunded by the employer.
Housing benefit entitlement £46.42
Nett rent to pay £3.58
Available income =
£29.50-£3.00-£3.58 = £22.92

£63.57
per week
2. U.G. Student aged 18 receiving London grant
Receives £2650pa, pays £50 rent and £6.00 travel.
Housing benefit entitlement

Available income for living expenses and travel
N.B,
£234.00pa is included in the grant for books

3. Unemployed single person aged 18

seeking work thus spends £6.00 on travel
Housing benefit entitlement £48.20
Nett rent to pay £1.80
Available income after deducting net rent & travel £19.60
If this person did not spend anything on travel this figure
would b

All figures are per week unless otherwise stated
forward their case. What you can do is the following:
1. Find out the facts-see me or the other
sabbaticals for this information.
2. Formulate your own arguments and opinions and
write to your local MP immediately-again we can
help you in what to write and how to find out who
your MP is.
3. Write to your parents or give us permission to
do so. If any student wishes us to send information
to their parents (after all it is probably them who will
end up paying) then simply drop an A4 envelope with
your parents' name and address into the Union Office
and we will send off the information.
4. Make sure that for every objection you have there
is a viable alternative. The Government is
implementing these proposals because they wish to
achieve certain objectives, i.e. increase access,
reduce expenditure on education. You must come up
with viable alternatives, again see us for the ideas.
We can only help you to help yourselves. If all of
the above seems too much like hard work then I have
absolutely no sympathy with you. I am putting in a
lot of work in coordinating this campaign it would be
appreciated if for once IC students could make a
similar effort. It will be you experiencing the effects
of loans, especially if you are in your first year.
