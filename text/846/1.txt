Tommorrow's
Student
Full
of
apathy
Empty of hope
An Extraordinary General Meeting of
Imperial College Union was held last
Tuesday to consider action against the
Government's proposed introduction of
student loans.
Neil McCluskey, I C U President,
explained that the Union's tactics were
now in the form of delaying the
Government in the hope that the timetable
for the introduction of student loans would
be disrupted. He went on to say that as
the next year was an election year, the
Government is unlikely to push through
a Bill if it is likely to be unpopular. He
said the Union may consider the unusual
action of lobbying the House of Lords as
a last resort.
Mr McCluskey asked all students to
write to their M P , and especially the
Conservative Party MPs, to argue with
them against the loans proposal. It was
pointed out that if an M P receives five or
more letters on a subject he or she must
open a file on it. Another tactic would be
to boycott Financial Institutions involved
in the issue of the student loans company.
An emergency motion was put forward
towards the end of the meeting to ban
Price-Waterhouse, the chartered
accountants who compiled the feasibility
report into student loans, from the
Imperial College Union Careers Fair. The
Union did not believe the report to be
factually correct and claimed that it had
been written according to the dictate of the
Department of Education and Science.
It was also decided to inform other
companies at the Careers Fair, other
student unions and career advisers of the
reason for this ban.
