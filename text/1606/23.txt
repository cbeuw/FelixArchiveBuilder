42% of registered voters) and the
“alternative vote” system was rejected
with only 32% in favour of change.
AV is not the same as a full-fat
proportional representation “PR”
system, which would aim to give each
party the same proportion of the
power in Westminster as indicated by
their percentage of the popular vote
across the country.
If the parties’ power were
determined solely by their national
share of the vote, the Tories would
have 240 MPs, Labour 200, UKIP
more than 80, Lib Dems 50, SNP 30,
and Greens 25.
One of the biggest problems
here is that, under this system,
Parliamentary representatives would
not have the constituency allegiances
that they currently do under FPTP. It
would also make single party majority
governments a thing of the past, as
we are very unlikely to see a party win
more than half of all the votes any
time soon.
The UK would be governed under
endless coalitions, such as the one
we had in 2010-2015. This is not
necessarily a bad thing, but it does
lead to inevitable compromises and
disagreements that typically make
the administration quite unstable.
However, the last five years of a
Conservative led coalition with the
Lib Dems has broadly been a success.
The coalition was stable and an
economic crisis was averted.
Generally speaking, single party
majorities give the government
the opportunity to execute their
manifestos with conviction, while
coalitions can make the public uneasy
about backroom negotiations and an
unclear mandate.
Personally, I would like to see a
single transferable alternative voting
system with constituency MPs
remaining as our representatives,
as this seems to be a reasonable
compromise between two of the
possible three options.
The best of both worlds.
With the increased support for
“We have
officially
moved into
a more
continental
style of
politics.”
The next
parliament
is set to
be one of
the most
volatile and
unstable
in our
history.
minority parties the debate about
electoral reform is likely to raise its
head again, and it is likely that there
is far more of an appetite for change
now than in 2011.
If we ever made the decision as a
country to move to a PR system, such
as the one in Germany, we would be
ending our nation’s history of single
party majorities.
But these changes would make
many who currently feel that their
vote is wasted in safe seats more likely
to participate in our democracy,
as any sensible, repsonsible citizen
should.
And that, in my view, can only be a
good thing.
