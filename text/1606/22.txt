Joshua Renken discusses the case for
a change in the voting system, and
outlines the possible alternatives
Is now the time for
electoral reform?
The election is over. It was a
tightly contested campaign but
in the end, the Tories carried
the day.
The final tally put the
Conservatives on a slim majority, and
sent Labour back to the opposition
bench for another five years.
The country has moved further
to the right, which ironically would
bring us closer to Europe, and
Miliband will not take the top spot in
UK politics.
This election saw the rise of three
insurgent parties – the SNP, UKIP
and the Green Party. The Scottish
Nationalists swept the board in
Scotland, winning 56 out of a possible
59 seats and 50% of all the votes
north of the border.
But is it fair that half the votes
translate to virtually all the
representatives?
Whatever your thoughts on
UKIP, it’s hard to suggest that they
only deserve one solitary MP after
receiving 3.8 million votes (an eighth
of all the ballots cast in the UK).
The Green Party also has just one
elected Member of Parliament,
despite receiving 1.1 million votes.
Two MPs for almost 5 million votes?
Is that really fair?
When you look at the average
number of votes it took to win each
MP, you see that the largest parties
do well from our current electoral
system.
The SNP received on average 26,000
votes for each of the seats they won
on 7th
May.
The Conservatives received 34,000.
Labour received 40,000 per MP
elected, and the Liberal Democrats
charted up 291,000 votes per MP.
The Greens snagged more than
1,100,000 votes despite only having
one MP and UKIP took a staggering
3,800,000 votes, just for Douglas
Carswell.
Clearly, the disparities are massive.
Ever since we found out the results
in the small hours of 8th
May, people
have been debating the merits of a
more proportional voting system.
In fact, electoral reform is one of
those rare species of subjects that
UKIP and the Greens can actually
agree on.
Natalie Bennett and Nigel Farage
both agree that first-past-the-post
(FPTP) has had its day and is no
longer democratic in this new age of
multi-party, more continental style
politics.
Here, I will outline the pros and
cons of our current system, and look
at some of the potential alternatives.
The current FPTP system
undoubtedly has its flaws, the chief
amongst them being that it is not
‘perfectly democratic’, in this case
since the number of seats a party
wins in the House of Commons is not
directly proportional to the number
of people that support them.
But in reality no system of
government can be perfectly
democratic.
One of FPTP’s supposed benefits
is that it is more likely than
other systems to deliver majority
governments. For a long time this
statement was, broadly speaking, true.
It meant that parties with far less
than 50% of the total vote could form
stable administrations.
This is because the amount of power
has is not directly dependent on the
share of the vote your party wins, but
rather by the number of seats where
your party can win the most votes.
FPTP works quite well in a two-
party system, and has produced a
century of alternating Labour and
Conservative governments.
FPTP also allows constituencies
to have a representative that has
that area’s best interests in mind.
However, due to the different
socio-economic circumstances in
each area, many people around the
country find themselves voting in
very ‘safe’ seats, where one party has
a disproportionately large amount of
support in the area compared to the
rest of the UK.
Having safe seats can, and
sometimes does, lead to poor
constituency MPs that take their seat
for granted and do not work hard to
serve their constituents.
But as we move to this new multi-
party political landscape, people are
beginning to question its merits.
Parties with a sizeable chunk of
the popular vote but secure far less
parliamentary representation – such
as the Lib Dems, the Greens and
UKIP – have a vested interest in
changing the electoral system, so that
the number of seats each party wins is
more closely aligned with the number
of people voting for them.
FPTP makes a lot of people feel
that their vote is wasted, and many
feel that they should vote tactically in
order to get the lesser of two evils.
So, what are the alternatives?
Well, in the UK we actually had a
referendum on electoral reform just
four years ago in 2011.
As part of the 2010 coalition
agreement between the Conservatives
and Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg
negotiated for an Alternative Vote
(AV) referendum.
In the AV system, voters can rank
the candidates in order of preference
instead of only putting an X next to
one candidate.
Ballots are initially distributed
based on each elector’s first
preference. If none of the candidates
manages to secure more than half
of votes cast, the candidate with the
fewest votes is eliminated.
Ballots assigned to the eliminated
candidate are recounted and added to
the totals of the remaining candidates
based on who is ranked next on each
ballot. This process continues until
one candidate wins by obtaining
more than half the votes.
One of the benefits of FPTP is its
sheer simplicity. You can explain it in
one sentence. “The candidate with the
most votes wins the constituency.”
However, the AV system would
ensure that the most agreeable
candidate wins, by taking into
account which of the candidates a
voter would prefer to see representing
them after their first choice.
The Conservatives and DUP took
the official position for a No vote,
while Labour had no official party
position. Every other minority party
was in favour of the change.
FPTP benefits the two largest
parties the most, so there is a large
incentive for all the other parties to
campaign for electoral reform.
In the recent election, the
Conservatives won 51% of the seats in
the House of Commons, but secured
only 37% of the popular vote. Labour
have 36% of the UK’s MPs with just
over 30% of the vote.
However, turnout was low (just
“Two MPs
for almost
5 million
votes? Is
that really
fair?”
“Having
safe seats
can lead
to poor
MPs that
take their
seat for
granted.”
