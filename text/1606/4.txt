BUAV to launch judicial review agains
investigation into allegations of animal a
The High Court has granted
the British Union for the
Abolition of Vivisection
(BUAV) permission to bring a judicial
review against the Home Office,
in which they are hoping to again
confront animal care at Imperial,
and also “prove that the Home Office
guilty of foul play”.
The BUAV are claiming that the
sanctions posed by the Home Office
on those at Imperial found to be
acting in breech of their animal
licence during an investigation to be
“extremely weak.”
The BUAV are stating that as a
result of an “erroneous” reference
in the Home Office report of the
investigation, the BUAV has been
misrepresented in the media and has
suffered from reputational damage as
a result.
They are also claiming that
“Imperial is misleading the public”
about the post-operative care it
provides for animals used in research,
as outlined in Imperial’s first Annual
Animal Research Review, published
in March 2014.
The Home Office report, authored
by the Animals in Science Regulation
Unit, was published back in
September 2014, and covered the
results of the investigation into
Imperial after the BUAV made
public allegations about animal
mistreatment.
The Home Office report states that:
“Over 180 individual allegations,
made by the animal rights
organisation, of noncompliance were
investigated.”
The BUAV are now claiming that
they have seen an unpublished table
from the Home Office report that
establishes that there were only
18 non-compliance allegations
investigated, not 180.
With the report finding only 5
cases of non-compliance in total, the
BUAV are testifying that Imperial
and other animal research advocates
have since capitalised on the “5 out of
180” claim.
They state that this claim being
repeated to the media has lead
to “misrepresentation [that] has
caused considerable damage,” to the
organisation.
The BUAV have since said to Felix:
“The BUAV has asked the Home
Office to correct the erroneous
reference to 180 but it has refused to
do so. The correct number is 18.
“As ICL [Imperial College London]
is fully aware (because it has the
BUAV report), the BUAV made
nothing like 180 allegations of non-
compliance and the Home Office has
declined to detail what it took to be
such allegations.
“But the important point is that
it is clear that the Home Office only
investigated 18 allegations.”
The BUAV had previously released
an eight-minute video that they
themselves described as “harrowing
and disturbing evidence,” and later
produced a 71 page report detailing
the findings, which was presented to
the then Home Office Minister Lord
Taylor of Holbeach.
The Home Office concluded in
their report upon review of the BUAV
material that “nothing was identified
to suggest either referral for
prosecution or immediate suspension
of licences on welfare grounds were
merited”.
The BUAV are also criticising
Imperial for perceived negligence,
stating that there should be staff
present at all hours on location after
animals have undergone invasive
surgery.
However, an Imperial college
spokesperson has addressed the issue,
stating: “Although there is not a
member of care staff present on site
24/7 there is always at least one vet
plus five senior animal care staff on
call 24/7 to attend to any emergencies
outside working hours.
“The environmental parameters for
the animals are monitored 24 hours
a day by computer and will alarm
when the parameters fall outside of
the Home Office Code of Practice. If
a problem occurs both maintenance
and CBS staff are contacted by
security and where necessary attend
site.”
The judicial review is currently
on-going. A spokesperson for the
Home Office told the Times Higher
Education (THE) earlier this week
that it would not be appropriate to
comment whilst legal procedures are
still taking place.
The clash between Imperial and
the BUAV started back in April 2013,
when The Sunday Times published
the findings of a BUAV associate who
was working undercover as a research
technician.
The reporter had filmed animal
research over the course of seven
months, which were compiled into an
eight minute video released online.
The video contained graphic imagery
of animal testing procedures, which
many found uncomfortable to watch.

enquiry soon after the BUAV

investigation was lead by Steve
Brown, Director of the MRC
Mammalian Genetics Unit at
Harwell. The enquiry began in July
2013 and the findings were published
the following December (2014).
The Brown investigation found that
Imperial lacked “adequate leadership,
management, operational, training,
supervisory and ethical review
standards,” and made thirty-three
recommendations to the college for
changes to working practices.
Said Brown at the time of the
review: “Our investigation identified
a number of serious concerns on the
BUAV also claims
Imperial is “misleading
the public” over post
operative care. Philippa
