Living it large on Avenue Q
Jack Steadman enjoys this debauched puppet musical far too much
There’s not a lot new to be said
about Avenue Q, on the face of
it. Although, inevitably, I’m
about to try.
It can be succinctly described as
the unholy offspring of The Muppets,
Sesame Street and the real world,
blending classic Jim Henson-style
puppetry with irreverent humour and
adult themes.
There’s a vicious streak of satire
running through the entire thing,
and the use of puppets is just a cutesy
smoke-screen for the grown-up, ugly
goings-on underneath.
Avenue Q is a frank look at life post-
education, at the time when you feel
like you should really be getting a grip
on your life, working a solid career,
finding love, settling down, all that
jazz. Avenue Q sticks two fingers up
at that.
Said two-fingered salute
commences from the opening song.
Newly graduated Princeton (Richard
Lowe) appears, sings a few lines about
feeling that he could change the
world, and then the real thing starts.
Kate Monster (Sarah Harlington)
and Brian (Richard Morse) get the ball
rolling with ‘It Sucks to be Me’, which
within the space of a few minutes lays
out the themes that the rest of the
musical will follow.
All this takes place around one,
static set – the titular Avenue Q.
A run-down block of houses, it
appears deceptively simple, initially
looking just like some doors and
windows for the cast to enter/exit
through or appear in while looking
out.
It quickly turns out there’s more
to it than that. At various points, the
fronts of the houses lower down to
reveal a miniature interior, acting as a
neat background to the goings on that
removes the need for complicated
scene changes.
There’s also a large section that
detaches and opens up to become a
bar for one scene, adding a greater
level of change that originally looked
unlikely. Throw in a neatly-lit
backdrop (and at least one massive
inflatable head that pops up from
behind the houses), and it’s a clever
way to achieve a lot with a little.
Touring productions always have
a variety in quality, not least in
their set, so it’s a genuine treat to
see something that’s so simple yet
functional without any obvious
detractors.
The way the cast move around the
set is also ingenious, with judicious
use of multiple puppets (and an
ensemble to operate them) allowing
the likes of Trekkie Monster (Stephen
Arden) to appear at completely
different ends of the stage within
seconds for such musical treats as
‘The Internet is for Porn’.
If you didn’t already know that
was one of the song titles: you’re in
for a treat. A treat compounded by
the likes of ‘If You Were Gay’, which
manages the delicate double act of
being slightly offensive and hugely
entertaining (while also slyly taking
the mickey out of Sesame Street’s
Bert and Ernie), and ‘Everyone’s a
Little Bit Racist’, which manages to
be hugely offensive and even more
entertaining.
A double win in everyone’s book
(except, perhaps, the easily offended,
who probably shouldn’t be here
anyway).
Those three songs are easily the
musical highlights, although that’s a
relative term in a musical as strong
as this. The songs are all either side-
splittingly hilarious or touchingly
emotional.
As with almost all musicals, the
earlier songs are the strongest (which
is where ‘Internet’, ‘Racist’ and ‘Gay’
come in), but the quality doesn’t let
up for the rest of the show.
‘There’s a Fine, Fine Line’ is a cute
Act 1 finale, while ‘Schadenfreude’ is
a merciless mockery of how, despite
our pretensions, we all still take
significant amounts of pleasure in the
misery of others.
Avenue Q doesn’t really let up
throughout its run-time, taking as
many pot-shots at as many targets
as it can possible think of (and then
a few more besides), even going so
far as to at one point send the cast
round, caps literally in hand, to beg a
few quid off the audience. And then
complain about their pitiful take.
The story does weaken somewhat
by the end, relying on some obvious
contrivances, but it’s all in such good
humour (and so patently ridiculous)
that the only choice is to accept it,
laugh at it, and move on – arguably a
good idea for life, truth be told.
There are a few minor flaws – the
sound is sometimes a little weak,
not always doing the (naturally
small, due to the touring nature of
this production) band justice, while
the use of a couple of video screens
detracts from the high production
values elsewhere. The screens are
tiny, the animation is low quality, and
were it not for the fact they’re needed
for a couple of plot-advancing jokes
the show would be better off without
them.
Fortunately, the flaws are
outweighed by the quality on display
elsewhere, not least in the cast.
Every single cast member is
flawless, and the hours upon hours
(upon hours upon hours) of rehearsal
time they must have spent with the
puppets has paid off handsomely
– the puppets are seamlessly
integrated into the show, with the
occasional hand-offs necessitated by
having several key roles doubled-up
occurring seamlessly, to the point
where most of the audience barely
even notice.
Honestly, you hardly notice the
puppeteers generally – as with the
Muppets, the puppets are instantly
accepted as ‘real’ without question,
and the fact that even here, where
there is so clearly someone standing
behind the puppet and controlling
their every movement, that’s still the
case is something genuinely magical.
This magic is rounded off by such
inspired moments of genius as the
Bad Idea Bears, which do exactly
what the name suggests, providing
some truly terrible ideas with
infectious enthusiasm and adorable
appearances.
Quick side-note: to whoever runs
the Bad Idea Bears Twitter account
(and yes, obviously that exists): you
are responsible for the greatest piece
of theatre marketing ever.
Credit must also go to whoever’s
been responsible for ensuring that
each theatre, alongside the usual
strobe and haze warnings, have been
putting up signs warning audiences of
‘mild puppet nudity.’
Consider yourselves warned.
This review is based on the production
at the Mercury Theatre, Colchester.
Avenue Q is currently at Greenwich
Theatre until Sun 26th
May.
Tickets from £20, available online.
