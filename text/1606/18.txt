with Denis gave me the confidence and skill to pass my driving test first time round.”

“Dennis is a fantastic teacher and knows how to get people from completely inexperienced and
utterly hopeless driving up to the standard to pass their test. He is always calm and his comments
are constructive; his knowledge of London and his knack of engineering driving routes that test
the learner make the lessons more than worth it. Since I have met him he has shown a great desire
to offer cheaper lessons to Imperial students and with backing of other students I am more than
happy to support him.”
Alex Kendall, Imperial College Union President 2010/11.
“I learned to drive in one of the busiest cities in the world. I passed first time. Would I r
ecommend Denis? Without hesitation.”
Leon Vanstone, Aeronautical Engineering, Imperial College London
