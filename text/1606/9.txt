Game of Thrones doesn’t deserve all the hate, argues Cecily Johnson
Why is televised rape so controversial?

This week the popular television
series Game of Thrones courted
controversy yet again after
featuring a disturbing scene in which
fan-favourite character Sansa Stark
was raped on her wedding night by
her new husband Ramsay Bolton.
‘Feminist community’ website The
Mary Sue announced that they would
no longer be “promoting” the show,
in an article which has been shared
tens of thousands of times on social
media. Editor-in-chief Jill Pantozzi
wrote that “We simply can’t bring
ourselves to be excited by a product
which no longer meets our needs as
fans”. US Senator Claire McCaskill
has called for a boycott of the show,
describing the storyline as “disgusting
and unacceptable”.
So why has this particular scene
drawn so much ire? Is it really the
worst thing Game of Thrones could
have done? Over the seasons the
show has featured the bodies of men
and women flayed alive; the charred
corpses of children; a pregnant
woman being stabbed in the belly;
live crucifixions; the brutal death of a
prostitute at the hands of a psychotic
boy king; a woman being hunted by
a pack of dogs and people wielding
crossbows; and one young man’s
prolonged physical and psychological
torture at the hands of another.
But this is a work of fiction. The
show is well known for its adult
content and themes, and this
storyline in particular has been
building up for the last few episodes,
since Sansa agreed to be married
to Ramsay in order to put her in a
position where she may somehow
seek revenge on the Boltons. The
audience had to know that there
would be a ‘wedding night’, and
we have seen enough of Ramsay’s
character to know that it wasn’t going
to make for pleasant viewing.
The outrage seems to have centred
on the fact that this particular event
involved a beloved character who
many people are rooting for, and that
the books’ version of this character
suffered no such misery. I should
probably explain for the non-book
readers that ‘book Sansa’ is safely
hidden away in the Eyrie where she
was at the start of the season; Ramsay
instead marries a Winterfell girl
called Jeyne Poole, who is passed off
as Arya Stark in the hope of securing
House Bolton’s hold on the North.
Played beautifully by Sophie
Turner, Sansa has made great leaps in
characterisation recently on the show;
her fans – and I count myself among
them – hope that she is really growing
into a strong player of the titular
Game. After all she has suffered at the
hands of Joffrey it is inspiring to see
Sansa taking charge of herself – so to
see her spirit beaten down once again
in such a brutal fashion is indeed
disheartening and deeply disturbing.
But I strongly believe that you can’t
just cry “but that didn’t happen in the
books” whenever you take a disliking
to a plot line. Novels and television
series are very different beasts; this
is by no means the first time that the
showrunners have combined plotlines
and characters from the books in
order to streamline the show. The
decision to fuse Sansa’s story with
that of Jeyne Poole can’t have been an
easy one, but it makes sense from a
storytelling point of view.
It would be a waste of a fantastic
actress to stash Sansa away in the
Eyrie for the remainder of the
season, and this plot line gives her
the opportunity to directly encounter
some of the people responsible for
the pain she has been through over
the course of the story. That is a
fascinating turn of events – but it
would be bad storytelling for her
to just barely begin maturing as
a character and then never have
anything bad happen to her ever
again. It is realistic for Sansa to
experience setbacks in her journey
and I for one am excited to see how
the character handles herself in this
daunting new world.
Some have also accused the
showrunners of “[making] that scene
about Theon’s pain” and not having
“the courage to keep the camera on
Turner’s face”; but had they chosen
instead to show the act directly,
would they not have been criticised
for self-aggrandisement? It’s okay to
be upset by depictions of rape and
sexual violence in the media, and I’m
not saying that no one should express
those feelings. But I disagree with
accusations that the show is “gross,
exploitative, and totally out of ideas”.
Game of Thrones has been quite
rightly criticised for its depiction
of sexual violence in the past.
I was horrified to hear that the
showrunners did not feel that they
had portrayed a rape in the infamous
scene between Cersei and Jaime last
season. To feature a scene that ended
with a person crying “No,” and “stop,
don’t” as their sexual aggressor stated
“I don’t care” and not consider it rape
was appalling and horrifying.
However, I don’t think that getting
it spectacularly wrong once before
means that Game of Thrones should
be forced to avoid such material
in the future. People don’t like to
see rape used as a stimulus for plot
development, and it’s true that this
has been done extremely poorly in
many stories over the years. Critics
have claimed that Sansa’s storyline
has been altered only to further that
of Theon/Reek, but I am going to wait
and see the consequences play out.
The world of Game of Thrones
has always been, in the words of A
Song of Ice and Fire author George
R. R. Martin, “no darker nor more
depraved than our own”. Sometimes
art makes us uncomfortable when
it confronts us with the things that
humans have done – and still do
– to one other. Whilst I certainly
don’t want to see sexual violence
taken lightly, its depiction in
popular culture is both important
and sometimes necessary. With
appropriate viewer warning I see no
reason to avoid telling stories of rape.
Game of Thrones has courted
controversy before, and I have no
doubt that it will do so again before
the story draws to a close; but in the
words of its creator:
“Rape and sexual violence have been
a part of every war ever fought, from
the ancient Sumerians to our present
day. To omit them from a narrative
centered on war and power would have
been fundamentally false and dishonest,
and would have undermined one of
the themes of the books: that the true
horrors of human history derive not from
orcs and Dark Lords, but from ourselves.
We are the monsters. (And the heroes
too). Each of us has within himself the
capacity for great good, and great evil.”
–George R. R. Martin
