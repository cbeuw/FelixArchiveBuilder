Do you really care about the NHS?

Jack Steadman definitely does, and so does Michael Wynne
The title of Michael Wynne’s
latest work, Who Cares, is both
deliberately provocative and
perfectly explanatory of what the
audience entering the Royal Court
have signed themselves up for.
This production for the Jerwood
Theatre Upstairs is less ‘state of
the nation’ and more ‘state of the
national health service’, a no-holds
barred examination of how the
NHS has fared, is faring, and will
fare under the previous and future
governments.
The play poses a series of striking
questions, the first of which is
nothing to do with the NHS, but is
instead “where the hell am I going?”
Ostensibly taking place in the
Court’s studio theatre, the show
actually kicks off by queueing in the
alley next to the theatre, between
it and the rehearsal/office building
located next door.
The doors to the rehearsal building
are opened, and each audience
member is given a coloured lanyard
(most of which mark out audience
members as ‘patients’, curiously) and
ushered into a waiting room ripped
straight out of a hospital Accident &
Emergency department.
A small group of actors occupy seats
in the centre of the room, in various
states of disarray. Blue curtains, of
the same sort that can be found in
hospitals across the country, obscure
the edges of the room. Double doors
are dotted throughout, with the
occasional blurred figure moving
behind them.
A cleaner appears from the end
of the room, mopping around the
clustered audience members. Some
move out of the way to allow her to
mop the patch of floor they were
standing on. It’s all a bit awkward. All
a bit confusing.
This would be a negative, were it
not for the fact it makes the whole
thing instantly immersive. It already
feels like the entire audience are
awkwardly standing in a waiting
room, hoping for instructions.
Suddenly, without warning, all hell
breaks loose.
Actors appear from all sides,
blasting through one set of double
doors into the waiting room, only
to immediately disappear through
another set.
The first speaker is Marjorie, a
nurse from Yorkshire, played with
real warmth and humanity by
Eileen O’Brien. She starts describing
her path into the health service, as
all around her various characters
interject with stories, facts, statistics
and more.
Some speak into a microphone
at the side of the room, their voice
blaring through the tannoy, some
address the audience directly, others
converse with each other. The whole
scene is beautifully orchestrated
chaos, and the audience are trapped
in the middle of it. Looking in, but
constantly aware that there is more
going on behind them. Within just a
few minutes, even this tiny room feels
like a part of something far larger.
Then, as quickly as it began, the
madness stops.
Everyone has disappeared. The
lights rise, and the audience are
quickly separated into groups.
From here, the promenade part
of Who Cares really comes into
force, as the existence of multiple
groups allows for the existence of
several short scenes that can all run
concurrently, with each group then
being guided onto the next.
It can only have been nothing
short of a logistical nightmare to
work out where everyone should be
(and when), a process honed to a fine
degree during previews, and it’s to the
immense credit of everyone involved
in the production – from the front
of house staff physically guiding the
audience members from station to
station to the cast themselves, playing
multiple roles, often with mere
seconds to change ahead of the arrival
of an audience – that it all comes
together so magnificently.
The production makes use of all of
the space available to the Royal Court
bar the main theatre – nothing is off-
limits here. The stage door becomes
just another entrance; the storage
locations in the roof of the building
turn into an operating theatre.
It’s in this operating theatre at the
very top of the building that one of
the more memorable scenes takes
place, as a former Chief Executive of
the NHS and an ex-Department of
Health National Director discuss the
relationship between politicians and
the NHS while they dissect a corpse.
Except, in this instance, the ‘corpse’
is actually one of the dummies seen
in classrooms across the country,
used to teach pupils basic anatomy.
The plastic entrails soon end up
everywhere, with one lung even
ending up being thrust into an
unsuspecting audience member’s
hands.
The Ex-Exec and former Director
leg it, leaving a confused nursing
team (and a somewhat startled
audience member) to pick up the
pieces as the audience are ushered
out. A fine metaphor for the NHS, if
ever there were one.
From that point onwards, the play
begins to deal with two main issues:
the inquiry into the Mid-Staffs
hospital trust, and the passage of the
2012 Health and Social Care Act.
There’s a real sense of anger that
runs through these scenes, with some
truly heart-breaking testimonies
being given as well as detailed,
unflinching political analysis.
There’s an unswerving sense of
realism occupying the whole play,
particularly in theses scenes, and
there’s a very good reason for that.
Who Cares is based, entirely, on
interviews with people across the
NHS: With patients, campaigners,
cleaners, nurses, students, junior
doctors, GPs, consultants, surgeons,
Chief Executives, anyone and
everyone who has any dealings with
the NHS.
Their words are reproduced
verbatim, reeled off by a talented
cast, who imbue each character with
a sense of the real person originally
speaking the words, even when
faced with the unenviable task – as
mentioned – of handling multiple
roles.
The closing moments of Who Cares
are unspeakably moving. There’s such
a visceral sense of pain and anger at
what’s happening to the NHS that
it’s impossible not to feel moved, and
there are more than a few damning
verdicts on the political mishandling
of the service as a whole.
It’s most fitting, though, that the
play ends as it began, with Marjorie
addressing the audience directly.
The NHS may be bureaucratic and
incomprehensibly sprawling. It may
at times feel deeply impersonal, and
cold.
But the people who work in it, for it,
are humans too, and many (if not all)
of them are wonderful human beings
who do it because they care.
The personal touch matters. That
we receive it even in this facsimilie of
the NHS is truly marvellous.
