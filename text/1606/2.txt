This week we’re covering the
latest developments in the
BUAV investigation against
Imperial. The BUAV has been
granted a judicial review against the
Home Office findings, stating that
their sanctions weren’t too severe.
They have also seemingly chucked
in a few allegations against Imperial
too, just in case we start to think
College are off the hook, this time
accusing College of “misleading the
public” in the care they provide for
research animals post surgery.
Imperial’s track record in animal
testing hasn’t been the best, but they
seem to be getting it right this time
around. After reading their Annual
Animal Research Review, and putting
the cooperate branding overkill
aside, the document does seem to
successfully convey just how much
time and effort they really are putting
into their reform. They’ve introduced
new advisory boards and committees
to bring together academics from all
departments and hopefully improve
the way we use animals in science,
and are thinking about the future of
animal testing to make sure we don’t
make the same mistakes again.
Imperial took those BUAV
allegations seriously; the use of
animals in science research is a
necessity but should still be treated
as a privilege instead of a right. The
use of living animals to further
our knowledge, understanding and
development of science and medicine
is a terrible trade off, and if we could
use models, tissues and programs to
do it for us we would. Technology
is still developing, but for the time
being, we rely on those little mice,
fish, ferrets and rabbits to test and
refine the drugs that keep us healthy
and save our lives.
There will always be casualties in
animal testing, and obviously no life
is worth more than another, but if we
are going to ensure that these animals
are to give up theirs to increase the
quality of our existence, we need to do
everything in our power to ensure the
pain is minimal, the suffering is short
and the value of the findings from
such testing is maximised.
Imperial, despite their flashy
websites, blog posts and news stories,
seem to have finally got to the root of
this ethos, and I have full faith that
the judicial review will find Imperial
is still doing all it can to ensure
animals are kept safe and happy.
Good management and guidance
will ensure that these values will
continue to trickle down into the lab
groups and beyond, and hopefully the
reputation of Imperial as a science
institute will slowly recover.
