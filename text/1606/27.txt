immediately, you don’t have to
bluff and pretend you know all the
answers in one hit. Like rehearsals,
what might feel right today doesn’t
necessarily right tomorrow; it’s kind
of evolving – you have to try and
work in places where you have the
right to change your mind – without
driving people mad, obviously! They
have deadlines. So, mostly those
are the kind of places I work, and I
consider that my job – to find those
places and make myself work within
them – because that’s the kind of
work I want to do.
For that reason I’ve pretty
much given up on doing opera,
because opera needs to have all its
information at a certain time which
is long before you start rehearsal. I
can do it, I have done it, and I’ve had
some great times, but essentially
what excites me most at the moment
is doing new work where you sort of
don’t know what it is. You work on
it, and then there’s an audience, and
the audience sort of tells you what it
is and then you have a week to make
it better. It’s exciting to be working
with your colleagues not knowing,
and to have one of those people be
the writer sitting alongside you in the
spirit of not knowing. At the moment
that’s my favourite thing. Carol Ann
is very much an open person, and I
think she enjoyed being with other
people. I imagine that writing can
be quite isolated – designing can be
quite isolated too – so sharing your
problems with your colleagues was
delightful.
JS: Definitely. Are you working on
anything new at the moment?
IM: I’m in a similar situation, doing
Medea [at the Almeida Theatre] – a
known, classic text, but it’s been
adapted by Rachel Cusk, who is a
feminist journalist and writer. It’s a
great idea having her do it, because
she has written in a very forthright
way about the mixed feelings around
being cast in the role of a mother –
not being cast in the role of a mother
by her children, but by the culture.
She’s written really well about it, and
the way the culture has an opinion
on the way a woman might now be
perceived now that she is a mother.
She’s fascinating on it, and she’s also
written about separation and divorce.
Her Medea is a really out-there
version of it which pulls no punches
and is kinda great. It tells you Medea’s
situation is not specific to any period
of time, it’s going on around you now.
JS: Brilliant. Do you have a
favourite show you’ve worked on?
IM: I did a production of An Inspector
Calls which is now very famous, it’s
over twenty years old and it’s still
running. I feel great about that,
because it was a particular time where
everything came together, in a way
that you hope for but is very hard to
achieve. So if I was only allowed to
point to one show, I’d probably point
to that.
JS: Have you had a most
challenging show to work on?
IM: I did Billy Elliot, and that’s a big
success, but when you’re doing it, it
certainly doesn’t feel like that. New
musicals, even with an experienced
story, which that is, are a hell of a job.
I’d not done a musical before, even
though I quite liked them, and I was
with a lot of people who had also not
done a musical before. New musicals
are difficult, they’re extraordinarily
difficult, and you’re trying to make
a machine that delivers pleasure to
an audience. Moment to moment,
that’s very, very precarious. The thing
that is assured – that you’re trying
to create something that gives an
audience emotional reassurance – just
feels confident as a piece of theatre.
That’s an extraordinarily hard thing
to do, the components can run away
from you so easily.
The pitfalls of naff are monumental,
the terrain is just loaded with
minefields. It’s a big hit now, and it’s
done ten years, and I’m proud of my
part in that; but when you’re doing it
for nigh-on two years, which we were,
it sure as hell doesn’t feel like it. It’s
more like a battle. With yourself, with
the material, with each other, there’s
nothing like it. That would be the
most challenging, I think, that I’ve
ever done.
JS: It’s a fantastic show, I love it.
I’ve got one more question – any
recent shows that you’ve seen, that
you’ve particularly enjoyed?
IM: I go on and on about A View from
the Bridge, Ivo van Hove – did you
see it?
JS: Yeah, I managed to catch it just
before it closed.
IM: I thought it was magical. You
saw things that were not there,
it was so confident and every
component about it was strong
and yet it moment-to-moment felt
breathtakingly audacious. So to be
strong and audacious all the same
time, and sort of not have a set, how
great is that? It was thrilling.
JS: It paid off in spades, I think.
IM: It did, but it’s interesting, I think,
because those two – that director and
that designer – they did Antigone at
the Barbican, did you see that? Did
you think it worked?
JS: I thought it worked pretty well,
I was entranced for a lot of it.
IM: I was very glad I saw it, but it
didn’t feel inevitable and assured in
the way that A View from the Bridge
did. So it made me respect that even
more, because I realised how difficult
and precarious that was. Whereas
when you were watching Antigone
you experience the kind of doubt, you
just saw how difficult a thing it is to
do. They made it look easy on A View
from the Bridge. Antigone makes you
realise it’s not at all easy, which made
me respect them even more.
Ian’s next show, Medea, opens at the
Almeida from 25th
September. Directed
by Rupert Goold and written by Rachel
Cusk.
