Zero-hours in an hour and a half
Jack Steadman is nowhere near beyond caring at the National
The house lights don’t dim at
the start of Beyond Caring.
That’s the first thing that
went through my head. That, rapidly
followed by “hang on, have we even
started?”
It’s a unique and bold use of
the Temporary Theatre, and an
instantly striking re-opening for the
National’s fourth theatre. Formerly
known as The Shed, the Temporary
Theatre wasn’t even meant to be here
anymore.
But here we are, at the start of a new
season of innovative and exciting
works.
Kicking things off is Beyond Caring,
originally penned by Alexander
Zeldin before undergoing extensive
work through workshops with the
company.
It tells the story of three zero-hour
workers, hired to clean a meat factory
alongside a full-time cleaner and a
vaguely sociopathic boss.
As a consequence, designer Natasha
Jenkins has opted to turn the entire
space into the meat factory, with the
rows of the audience looking, and
feeling, as if they have been simply
dropped into the space by some
unknown force.
A fridge, a hot-drink-dispensing
vending machine and other break-
room clutter are visible off towards
one of the emergency exits.
On the other side of the room,
shelves upon shelves of cleaning
equipment sit, looking suspiciously
like someone forgot to cover them up
before the audience comes in.
The whole space feels like that,
honestly. Fluorescent lights dangle
from the ceiling, acting as the house
lights.
The Temporary Theatre doesn’t feel
like a theatre at all, it doesn’t even
feel like a studio space. It feels like
a meat factory. It’s a masterpiece of
minimalist design.
After a few moments of awkward
silence, as the front-of-house team
close the doors but any actors fail to
materialise, one of the emergency exit
doors swings open.
A man walks in, collects a book
from the messy table that sits in the
centre of the room, and leaves again.
A door slams. Another awkward
pause follows.
The doors swing open again, and a
new figure arrives. They look around
awkwardly, waiting for something to
happen. The doors swing open again.
And so on.
Beyond Caring has significant
balls, that much is already obvious.
It’s willing to leave the audience
dangling, providing them with no
explanation or description of what’s
going on (or even supposed to be
going on). All we have is what we see
in front of us.
And what we see is brutal. Nothing
truly awful happens here. There are
no spectacular outbursts of violence.
Nobody dies. There isn’t a hero, with
some unspeakable evil he’s destined
to confront. None of that.
Instead, there’s just an insidious
sense of dread, a pervading
discomfort that clings to you long
after you walk out of the theatre.
The four cleaners, Grace, Susan,
Becky and Phil try to make it through
each night, leaving as the sun rises.
Through the small hours, they clean
the various parts of the factory, under
the watchful, slightly malicious eye
of Ian.
Of all the characters, Ian’s is
the hardest to get a grip on. His
nastiness isn’t always outright cruelty
(although it occasionally verges into
it), it’s more just an absence of caring.
He can’t empathise with the people he
sees as beneath him.
This dynamic proves the main
driving force of the play, which is
otherwise content to simply let its
characters be, and to use their mere
existence as a window to examine
the nature of zero-hours contracts,
and what working on one can do to a
person.
It’s a fully issue-driven play, to the
point where a whiteboard behind
the box office records the latest news
on zero-hour contracts for all to see,
often picking up on various political
pledges across the board.
Before, during, and now after an
election that saw a Conservative
government with little care for the
plight of zero-hour workers, Beyond
Caring could scarcely feel more
topical.
Not that this politics is explicitly
addressed in the play, mind. Far from
it.
This is such a tightly focused
piece of work that it doesn’t have
time to discuss grand ideas, or even
the machinations of government –
these are people who are focused on
surviving.
Their struggles are those of people
living from paycheck to paycheck.
When two of the girls discover their
agency won’t be paying them for
another week, their world falls apart.
One desperately tries to get a single
day off to go and visit her daughter,
to no avail.
One attempts to deal with the
situation she now finds herself in,
forced to work because a government
agency hasn’t deemed her ‘disabled
enough’ to qualify for disability
allowance.
Political promises don’t enter
into it. All this is sold by the acting.
The cast were involved in devising
the piece, and it shows, giving their
characters a weary, lived-in façade
that feels unbearably real.
They have arcs, of sorts, and from
that they each have redeeming
moments – some of which are enough
to make you weep. Or at least, they all
do, bar Ian.
He occasionally provides comic
relief, occasionally provides a figure
of mutual hatred, but he doesn’t
really change.
He’s never truly redeemed, which
doesn’t do Luke Clarke’s performance
justice.
This is gut-wrenching stuff,
and even though it’s so seemingly
mundance on the face of it – wages,
hours, illness – it matters so much
to the characters, just as it matters
so much to so many people in this
country, in this moment, that it can’t
help but grip you.
It’s impossible to look away, even
when you desperately want to, even
when you need to.
These people can’t escape their
situation. Why should you be able to?
Beyond Caring is at the Temporary
Theatre (National Theatre) until
Saturday 23rd
May. Tickets from £15,
available online.
