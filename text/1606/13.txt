Fred Fyles is hooked by a brutal piece of cinema from Ukraine
Tribal warfare on the big screen
It’s difficult to describe the
Ukrainian film The Tribe in a
way that doesn’t make it sound
like an ‘Elevator Pitch’, one of those
nebulous phrases taught in business
schools that’s supposed to ensure a
product’s marketability. A film set in
a school for deaf children, The Tribe
is conducted entirely through sign
language, with no spoken dialogue, no
subtitles, and no explanation.
High concept, it may be, but The
Tribe is far from marketable. It is
quite possibly one of the most brutal,
gruelling films to come out this year.
It also just may be one of the best.
We begin the film by being
introduced to Serhiy (Hryhoriy
Fesenko), arriving at a boarding
school for the deaf under a blanket
of foul weather that never really lifts,
smothering the film in a uniquely
Eastern European bleakness.
As time goes on, Serhiy is
drawn deeper and deeper into the
underground criminal racket that
the older students, aided by their
woodworking teacher, have organised;
the acts depicted in full gruesome
detail on screen include prostitution,
torture, murder, and possibly human
trafficking – although the nature of
the production means that nothing
is sure.
The director Myroslav
Slaboshpytskiy throws us
into an unforgiving world
of misunderstanding and
misinterpretation, leaving us to make
our own decisions about who is right
or wrong.
As the plot becomes more complex,
and Serhiy becomes infatuated
with Anna (Yana Novikova), the
characters’ actions become more and
more difficult to read, trapped as we
are behind a screen of muteness.
Throughout, Slaboshpytskiy keeps
the camera moving, filming the
scenes in a series of long shots that
require nerves of steel to sit through,
including the most harrowingly
graphic abortion scene I’ve witnessed
since Cristian Mungiu’s 4 Months, 3
Weeks and 2 Days.
The fact that such shots were pulled
off is testament to both the skill of
Slaboshpytskiy, and the discerning
eye with which he assembled the cast
– mainly amateur deaf actors.
They need no acting classes, no
drama degrees; they’ve spent their
lives using facial expression and
movements to get their point across,
and the physicality of acting is like
second nature to them.
There are some obvious reference
points within The Tribe, chief among
them being William Golding’s 1954
novel Lord of the Flies, which centres
around a group of schoolchildren
becoming feral, revealing the
darkness in man’s heart.
But while the experiences of Jack,
Ralph, and Piggy were written to
underline the fact that mankind
is consistently evil, The Tribe’s
energy comes from the fact that the
mainstream audience is consistently
alienated.
Taking on the experience of a
lifetime of being The Other, the deaf
children have turned the tables, and
are now holding us at arm’s length;
our misunderstanding become a locus
of resistance through which their
anger is expressed.
When viewed in such a way, the
plot, which on paper can sound
ludicrous, begins to make sense:
vilified by the community at large,
and shipped off to an enclosed space
in which they won’t upset our idea
of ‘normality’, the children are using
their deafness as a weapon, resisting
any form of polite society, and
forging a world in their own image.
That being said, there are moments
where the plot points feel somewhat
heavy handed, and the facade of
realism the film holds up begins
to slip: where are the adults at the
school?
Surely, when ransacking someone’s
apartment, there must be some non-
deaf people in the vicinity who can
hear what’s going on?
But such actions only seem to
reinforce the strange, dreamlike
nature of the film, oppressive in its
silence.
I am sure, furthermore, that there
will be some who are disgusted by
the frank, explicit nature of the film,
particularly the abortion scene.
While I am sure there is a case for
this criticism, all I will say is this: The
Tribe is not meant to be an enjoyable
film.
Without any idea of when or where
the film is set – some clues give
things away: the cyrillic alphabet; the
presence of a MacBook – the audience
is disengaged from temporal and
spatial reality, cast adrift on a wave of
alienation.
The removal of any spoken
language only deepens this
experience, with the lack of any
form of musical accompaniment
accentuating the silent lives of the
children.
There are occasions when we do see
people talking, but they are hidden
behind thick glass, tantalisingly out
of reach, making the audience long
for a point of contact that will never
be made.
But the soundtrack to this film
is not one of silence. The void that
has been created by the loss of
language is filled with a vocabulary
of inertia: feet squeaking on a newly
polished floor; bottles being cracked
sickeningly over human skulls; the
dull thump of flesh upon flesh.
With our senses amplified, we are
able to take in more than ever before,
and this intoxication of strange
sounds is awesomely gruesome.
A remarkably unique piece of
cinema, which defies the conventions
of our idea of the medium, The Tribe
is a complete triumph.
Its sheer power is stunning,
crushing the audience into
submission, and seemingly
vacuuming out all the air in the room.
I haven’t been able to stop thinking
about it since the first viewing, and
I am certain that it is a film that will
reward revisits.
Leaving the cinema, thrust into the
hustle and bustle of modern London,
I am confronted by a cacophony of
new sounds, as thoughts of alienation
and belonging, violence and brutality,
love and life swirl around my head.
"A series
of long
shots that
require
nerves of
steel to sit
through."
"The
children
are using
their
deafness as
a weapon."
