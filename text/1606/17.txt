House of Holland
For all those of you who’ve
waited for this day, it’s coming!
Henry Holland (pictured right),
of House of Holland, has announced
that there will be a menswear offering
from next month! The new addition
to his already successful womenswear
collection will be debuted in June’s
London Collections: Men.
So what can you expect from
the fashion designer? This fashion
follower suspects a runaway from the
typical (yet classic) runway look of
plaid or herringbone two, three, four
or five piece suits. Instead, dream a bit
more of glittering metallic, possibly
from a constellation of colours. We
might even get skirts, we might not!
Who knows what is in store? What
we do know is that the collection
will surely be a feast for the eyes, a
sort of messy orgasm that feels so
undoubtedly good we are slain for at
least a couple of days.
Whilst many may freak about the
thought of being caught out in one
of Holland’s more creative pieces, it
is important to realise that Holland’s
clothing seeks to empower in a way
many other designers fail to do so.
The bold and often striking designs
are not for the faint hearted, but
those who wear them will know what
the clothing exude. Now men, straight
or gay, will be able to boost their
presence with out of the ordinary
looks.
Henry Holland has in the past
spoken about a menswear line to
accompany the brands womenswear
line, which is a star favourite. Miley
Cyrus, Rihanna and Holland’s very
own muse, Nicola Roberts, are often
seen wearing clothing from the
designer.
We know Holland’s main fashion
line may not be to everyone’s taste.
We all have different styles after all.
However, Holland has already gone
into accessories. So if you’re looking
to up your ante and dress to impress
without going too over the top and
abandoning who you really are, you
could opt for a pair of statement
sunglasses. You don’t even have to
wear them on your face. Carrying
them like a clutch is the ultimate
guide for releasing the cool girl inside.
Whilst we wait, here are some
pictures for the ladies who may still
need a bit of inspiration for their
looks this coming Autumn/Winter
season for 2015/2016 (the fashion
industry is always one season ahead!)
Note his sensible cool factor,
epitomising the “old school” London
fashion typique (made up word, but
that’s how I roll!), but bringing it to
the epicentre of fashion today!
