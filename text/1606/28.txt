A fractured take on a fractured world

Jack Steadman has never seen Carmen, but that doesn’t matter
Simons Stephens ranks as one
of Britain’s most prolific
playwrights, which makes it
no surprise that, fresh off the run
of Birdland at the Royal Court last
summer, he’s already back, this
time in the Almeida Theatre in the
theatre with Carmen Disruption, a
musing on life, love and loss in an
unnamed European city.
As the title suggests, Carmen
Disruption follows (somewhat loosely,
truth be told) the structure of Bizet’s
opera, using the characters and
themes of that work to examine the
life of an opera singer, travelling from
country to country, always playing
the same role – always playing
Carmen.
The Singer in question is played
wonderfully by Sharon Small, who
captures the confusion and loss of
identity that sits at the heart of the
character.
When you spend every day of your
life playing at being someone else
– and playing at being one, specific
person at that – how do you continue
to draw the boundary between their
life and yours?
The Singer is in a situation far
removed from ordinary people’s lives
– even from ordinary actor’s lives,
in fact. Very few people live the way
opera singers do, with many singers
simply playing the same role across
multiple different productions.
Stephens acknowledges this fact
as the inspiration for the entire
play, with the work spiralling out
of an interview with Rinat Shaham,
an internationally-famous mezzo-
soprano who has played Carmen more
than 400 times.
That unique situation should mean
that The Singer is alien to us, so
distant that it makes it impossible to
truly empathise with her, but therein
lies the genius of Stephens’ script and
Small’s performance.
The Singer’s weariness, her
confusion, all of it, all blends to give
something achingly human, speaking
to a truth that exists in a world
beyond opera.
The other characters allow
Stephens to examine different facets
of this underlying loneliness, as he
manipulates the original character
archetypes into something new and
exciting.
Carmen becomes a young,
handsome male prostitute (with
a strong sense of his own looks),
played with hilarious bravado by Jack
Farthing.
Don Jose, Carmen’s love interest in
the original, now becomes a female
taxi driver (Noma Dumezweni),
forced to do one last, suspiciously
criminal job before meeting her long-
lost child.
The bullfighter Escamillo is now
a high-flying banker-type, played
by John Light, with a self-serving
criminal bent.
He is the last to be introduced,
although he’s rapidly the most
engaging as his attempts at financial
gain threaten to backfire and crush
him.
The ‘nice girl’ Micaela(Katie West)
is a student (at what can only be
presumed to be a university – the
city, and by extension wherever
she is studying – goes unnamed
throughout) fresh out of a
relationship with her sixty three-
year-old professor.
This particular situation is
referenced from the start, but only
becomes clear about two-thirds of the
way into the play, at which point it
provoked an audible gasp from the
audience I was in.
This steady unwinding, with the
occasional floor-shaking revelation,
is the case for all of the characters, as
each are given their own moment to
shine.
Carmen’s mistreatment at the
hands of a client, and his immediate
revenge is a weird mixture of comedy
and disgust.
There’s an unflinching honesty in it
that means you can’t look away, as the
world Stephens has built draws you
in, inexorably.
The play’s composition is part of
this allure – none of the characters
directly interact with each other at
any point.
They cross paths in-world – each is
referenced in the other’s stories, but
the closest to a direct interaction is
the moment the Singer realises that
each of them represents a character
from the opera. Or at least, represents
that character’s archetype.
The whole thing is essentially a
series of overlapping monologues,
intertwined with bursts of song from
the mezzo-soprano Viktoria Vizin
as the Chorus, accompanied by two
cellists who sit on the side of the stage,
in full view of the audience.
Almost all of the music is played
by the duo live, with styles ranging
from the classical (including,
obviously, snatches of Carmen itself)
to abrasively modern.
It’s a bold choice, and one that reaps
rewards.
The combination of the cellists
and Vizin’s soaring voice raises
goosebumps, searing itself into your
memory instantly.
And all of that is before you get to
the set.
The live music may have been a
bold move, but the set is an even
bolder one – a literal deconstruction
of the environment, of both Carmen
and the unnamed city.
A bull, presumably the one killed in
Carmen’s climax, is sprawled centre-
stage. All around it, rubble. Bricks,
scattered across the space.
The rear wall and wings of the
theatre are fully exposed, with the
mechanisms of theatre – the lights,
the speakers, the cables that run
between them, all on completely open
display.
It’s a stark image, unlike almost
any other on London stages. It
goes beyond a kind of minimalism,
moving from an emptiness to a
physically crumbling theatre. At
one point, rubble even falls from the
ceiling.
This, combined with the music
and the performances, which display
intense emotion mixed with a
disconnected distance – from each
other, and from the world at large – is
what makes Carmen Disruption a truly
memorable experience.
The imagery of the show is burnt
onto your retinas, the music lingers in
your ears, and Carmen is truly reborn.
Carmen Disruption is at the Almeida
Theatre until 23rd
May. Tickets from £9,
available online.
