Kunal Wagle finds out what’s coming next for Open Air Laboratories
Open Air Laboratories (OPAL),
a citizen science project run by
Imperial College London, has
expanded to cover the entirety of the
United Kingdom.
The project, which was initially
launched in 2007, is being rolled out
across Wales, Northern Ireland and
Scotland courtesy of a grant from the
Big Lottery Fund.
The project’s aims are to allow
people to engage with nature and
environmental issues, provide the
health and wellbeing benefits of
being outside, and provide a learning
experience. It also intends to provide
valuable data that helps professional
scientists understand the current
state of the environment.
The expansion will allow OPAL
to launch a new activity on the New
Zealand Flat Worm, a species that
feeds on the earthworm, which is
crucial for soil health. Of the worm,
Dr David Slawson, director of
OPAL, said, “It is more prevalent in
Northern Ireland and Scotland than
it is in England and Wales.
“Generally, most of the pests and
diseases tend to come into South-East
England and spread northwards.
Here’s one that might be moving in
the opposite direction.”
Alys Fowler, who is a gardening
columnist for the Guardian, said of the
project “OPAL is a great way to find
out about the nature right on your
doorstep – wherever you live in the
UK.		
“It’s really easy to get started; you
don’t need any previous knowledge
or experience and it doesn’t matter if
you live in the countryside or a city.
Best of all, OPAL resources are free
and available to download from www.
opalexplorenature.org right now, so
you don’t have any excuses not to get
involved!”
Over the last eight years OPAL has
conducted surveys on topics ranging
from earthworms to air pollution.
They also have completed surveys on
water and biodiversity (in 2010), and
climate and bug counts in 2011.
Dr Slawson said, “This really does
increase the number of observations
that experts alone would not be able
to make.
“We designed the surveys very
carefully, and we did not ask people to
do anything that was too complicated.
“For example, when it came to the
tree health survey, we asked people
to identify insect pests (not fungal
infections) which are easy to identify.
“This offers reassurance about data
accuracy.”
Five Imperial researchers
elected Academy Fellows
Five researchers from Imperial
College London have been
elected to the Fellowship of
the Academy of Medical Sciences in
recognition of their work in medical
science.
Professors Wendy Atkin, Christl
Donnelly, Jorge Ferrer, Michael Way
and Martin Wilkins will join 39 other
new Fellows to be formally admitted
in a ceremony this July 2015.
Academy Fellows are recognised
for excellence in medical research,
and in particular for their innovative
application of scientific knowledge, or
service to healthcare that is perceived
as significant.
Professor Wendy Atkin specialises
in Gastrointestinal Epidemiology
in the Department of Surgery and
Cancer. Her research was key to the
development of a new national bowel
screening programme.
Christl Donnelly is Professor
of Statistical Epidemiology in the
MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis
and Modelling, part of the School of
Public Health. Her research is crucial
to the study of disease outbreak.
Professor Jorge Ferrer, Head
of the Department of Medicine’s
Epigenomics and Disease Section
and Leader of the NIHR Imperial
BRC Genetics and Genomics Theme,
has made contributions to pancreas
regeneration and diabetes research.
Michael Way is a Senior Scientist
at the Francis Crick Institute
and Professor of Virology in the
Department of Medicine. His work
has developed our understanding
of how viruses use the cytoskeleton
within our cells to spread through the
body.
Finally, Head of the Department
of Medicine Martin R. Wilkins, a
Professor of Clinical Pharmacology,
was elected for his research
examining new disease treatments
through proof-of-concept studies in
humans.

Professor to join
Royal Academy
Professor Erol Gelenbe,
a researcher from the
Department of Electrical and
Electronic Engineering, has been
made a Fellow of the Royal Academy,
Sciences, Letters and Art of Belgium.
The prestigious society elected
just 19 new Fellows this year,
including a Nobel Laureate and a
Fields Medallist. Professor Gelenbe
was recognised for his work in the
modelling of computer systems,
which inspired several industrial
prototypes.
“I am very touched and honoured,”
said Professor Gelenbe. “The
Fellowship is also recognition of an
area of research that I pioneered and
of my industrial impact, which is very
gratifying.
“My family and friends are looking
forward to the formal ceremony in
Brussels, and I think I will celebrate
by having one or two of those famous
Belgian beers”. The ceremony will
take place at the end of May in the
Palace of the Academy in Brussels.

Over the past four decades,
Professor Gelenbe has been
developing programs that test the
performance of computer systems,
checking whether they respond in a
logical and timely manner.
These simulations and
mathematical models have been used
by telephone companies in early
digital switching technologies and in
modern mobile telephone signalling.
A number of industrial projects
have resulted directly from Professor
Gelenbe’s research, including the
manufacturing process simulation
tool FLEXSIM, and the commercial
software GNAP/Modline, which
is used to optimise processes by
predicting the performance of a
computer system.
He also pioneered various other
communications technologies
including the XANTHOS system,
the first Ethernet-like fibre optic
local area network, which was used in
facilities such as nuclear power plants.
Professor Gelenbe’s research
currently focuses on developing
quantum ‘nano-networks’ which
convey information by exploiting the
magnetic spin of electrons.
