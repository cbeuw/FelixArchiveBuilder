Avengers subtitles ‘too literal’
Age of Ultron is rapidly
approaching a worldwide
box office take of one billion
US dollars (a touch under £650
million), but that doesn’t mean it
hasn’t encountered its fair share of
problems.
Joss Whedon’s latest contribution
to the Marvel Cinematic Universe
has just opened in China, a relative
newcomer to the blockbuster film
market, and one which Marvel has a
record of playing to.
Iron Man 3 featured scenes that were
exclusive to the Chinese version of
the film, greatly helping the film’s
popularity in the country.
Avengers has run into some
problems with its subtitling, however.
The Hollywood Reporter has
the scoop on rumours that the
translations for the film are too
literal.
Some of the film’s choice lines
have been butchered, with Captain
America (Chris Evan)’s “You get hurt,
hurt ‘em back. You get killed… walk
it off,” turning into the rather more
simple “Run fast if someone tries to
kill you.”
Simpler advice, but less resounding.
The Reporter also references
reports from social media of other
mangled translations, ranging from
“We may not make it out of this”
turning into “Let’s back off now” all
the way through to “son of a bitch”
appearing onscreen as “my old,
familiar partner.”
The faulty translations have
apparently caused distress among
movie-goers, with some even going so
far as to leave the cinema.
The translation was apparently
carried out by Liu Dayong,
responsible for translations of The
Hobbit: The Battle of Five Armies,
Avatar and Titanic.
Dayong mentored fellow translator
Jia Xiuyan, who may also have been
involved with the Avengers subtitling.
Xiuyan was responsible for the
translations for last year’s smash
Marvel hit Guardians of the Galaxy,
which caused similar reactions.
Criticisms of its literalism were
common, while the translation of
the film’s title also caused some
confusion. But then, Interplanetary
Unusual Attacking Team doesn’t make
much sense however you spin it.
Some exhibitors in China have
reportedly corrected the translation
themselves.

Cannes bannes* selfies and flats
With Hollywood descending
onto the red carpets of the
68th
Cannes International
Film Festival, the organisers have
stirred up controversy first by
banning stars from taking selfies,
then reportedly turning women away
from screenings because they weren’t
wearing high heels.
Festival director Thierry Frémaux,
who first introduced the ‘unofficial’
selfie ban at an event last month
revealing this year’s festival
programme, described the practise
of selfie-taking as “ridiculous and
grotesque” and complained that it
“really slows things down”.
Frémaux added “You’ll never
look as ugly as you do in a selfie”.
Security guards have apparently
been instructed to hand out “serious
warning[s]”, but aren’t going so far as
to confiscate phones from any rogue
selfie-takers.
The festival has also faced backlash
after barring women from entering
a film screening for not wearing
high heels. A group of women were
turned away from a screening of Todd
Haynes’ lesbian romance film Carol,
according to Screen magazine.
The women, some of whom
reportedly cannot wear heels due
to medical conditions, were denied
entry to the event despite wearing
‘smart’ rhinestone-studded shoes. The
festival declined to comment on the
incident, but confirmed that women
are obligated to wear high heels to
red-carpet screenings.
Asif Kapadia, director of the
highly anticipated Amy Winehouse
documentary Amy, tweeted that
his wife had also been turned away
from a festival event, though she was
“eventually let in”.
Film producer Valeria Richter,
who has had part of her left foot
amputated, also claimed to have been
stopped “four times” by staff at the
premier for The Sea of Trees. She said
“We put on the dress and make an
effort to be formal and festive, but to
demand heels is not right”.
Another Cannes regular stated
“I’ve heard this happening several
times now. It’s bullshit. Someone I
know was turned away for wearing
nice flats, nothing you would wear
to the beach. They were in their 50s.
They told her she could go and buy
appropriate shoes and come back”.
However, Thierry Frémaux
later tweeted “The rumour saying
the festival insists on high heels
for women on the red carpet is
unfounded”.
*Yes, this is a pun. Deal with it. -Ed.
