Giulia Gabrielli reviews Mad Men’s season finale
A seven season long advertisement for
advertising
As a TV writer, sometimes
I find myself in a bit a
predicament. What should
I leave for readers to discover, and
what should I reveal? The finale of the
series Mad Men is a perfect example.
As the series that taught all men
how to wear a suit, and all women
how lucky we are not to live in the
1960s comes to an end, I wonder
whether it’s enough of an event for
me to spoiler, or whether I should
hold back on what awaits Mr Donald
Draper and colleagues.
Basically, I feel I need to warn you
that there will be some spoilers, tough
shit.
First of all, what has happened to
Mad Men in the last year? After a
very long break, the show came back
eight weeks ago, all 1970s hairdos and
bad moustaches.
For most people without a
photographic memory, it was almost
impossible to get back into the plot
without a good recap. Did somebody
die at some point?
The show seemed lost, as did its
main character and icon Don Draper:
forty, recently divorced, and showing
a little too many wrinkles around the
eyes.
Yeah, his second wife was a bitch (as
was his first one for that matter) and
yeah he’s the misunderstood son of
a prostitute/tragic Korean War vet,
but we can’t help but feel he slightly
brought it on himself.
The years of frowns and intense
silences have left Don incapable of
communicating with other human
beings and addicted to most legal, and
at times illegal, highs.
In true Jack Kerouac fashion,
there’s only one thing that can save
him: a long trip across the immense
landscapes of America. Never mind
his children, or work, or friends, this
is Don Draper for fuck sake!
Up until the finale, Don’s voyage
didn’t seem like it could have likely
brought him the peace he was looking
for: getting him robbed, bashed
and forcing him to sell most of his
possession on the way, ending up
stuck in a hippie commune hugging
people.
This was all put into perspective in
the last three minutes of the show,
when inspiration suddenly strikes
him, warrantying the first real smile
of the whole show.
It is revealed that Don Draper is in
fact the creator of the phenomenally
successful Coca Cola “Hilltop”
commercial: an ending that also turns
out to be a massive Coca Cola advert,
then. Story of our lives.
And what about the rest of the cast?
The authors decided to make these
plotlines, surprisingly, a little more
predictable, finally satisfying the
viewers’ requests.
Turns out the two heroes of the
show are in fact two heroines: out
of the ashes of the booze-fuelled
swinging Sixties rise Joan and Peggy.
The two are now the decision
makers in the game, after years of
acting as glorified secretaries.
The too-sexy-for-her-own-good
redhead has had enough of depending
on men and decides to put her less
apparent skills to good use, creating
her own new company, that we are
sure will eventually conquer the
world.
At McCann Erickson, on the other
hand, Peggy has to fight to keep the
power she’s earned now she’s in a big,
corporate agency. Thank God she
finally has a man and all is good in
this black-and-white world, since no
woman can really be happy without
one.
Of course this is the part of the
story that ticks the big romantic kiss
box.
Unfortunate, although very sweet,
since Mad Men had rarely had to
rely on such clichés to attract its
audiences. In fact, Peggy’s modest
surprise at her colleague Stan
Rizzo’s declaration of love was a bit
sickening, considering most viewers
were anticipating the scene from his
first appearance.
All things considered, no big
ending for the show. Who knew, after
all, Mad Men was really all about
advertising? No subtle meaning, no
growth.
Of course, the way women are
treated may have changed slightly,
but Don is left doing what he does
best: inventing jingles and seducing
women.
Ultimately Man Men’s was a happy
ending.
Well, for everyone except for
the whole of humanity, spoilt and
corrupted by advertising companies
who take messages of love and peace
and use them to promote carbonated
drinks.
But that’s another story.
