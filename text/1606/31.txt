A bad case of the Twits
Jack Steadman gets enthused about theatre – just not this play
Roald Dahl’s made a bit of a
resurgence of late, with The
Twits representing the third
adaptation of his works for the West
End stage in four years.
It follows on from Tim Minchin
and Dennis Kelly’s musical
adaptation of Matilda, and Sam
Mendes’ delivery of Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory in big-budget,
musical form. Enda Walsh’s
“mischievous” adaptation is therefore
the first of the three to not be a
musical, perhaps a touch unsurprising
given its home at the Royal Court.
It still features its fair share of
music, though, and even a spot of
singing, so fear not. It’s not quite
all change in the world of Dahl
adaptations.
The Twits is a very different book
from its fellow adaptees, however.
It’s a much darker tale, with a pair of
genuinely disgusting protagonists in
the eponymous Twits.
There’s no goody-two-shoes
character whose journey the book
charts; there’s no real sense of hope;
it’s all a bit depressing up until the
end, really.
There are also no children involved,
which – for better or for worse –
means there aren’t any children on
stage in this one. Still plenty in the
audience, mind.
The fact that this is an adaptation
of a beloved children’s book by a
beloved children’s author naturally
means this play is inherently targeted
at children, an audience who aren’t
renowned for their solo theatre-going
skills. Or, in fact, for anything much
beyond being children and one day
growing up.
To that end, the play needs to
attract adults too, which leaves it
aiming for that somewhat Pixar-
esque goal of pleasing young and old
alike.
On stage, the results of this need can
probably be summarised as “mixed”.
Matilda succeeds by being
uproariously funny – the music and
lyrics are by Tim Minchin, for crying
out loud – while Charlie succeeds by
being little short of awe-inspiring.
They pumped money into that thing.
The Twits lacks both the hilarious
songs and the excessive budget, and
despite the best efforts of all involved
it starts to flouder as a result.
The set design is ingenious, flicking
between two main states: inside the
Twits’ house and outside through the
medium of a drawbridge, with its one
real moment of triumph coming late
on in the play.
It’s very, very cleverly put together,
and looks rather impressive, although
it lacks the wow-factor that the likes
of Birdland previously achieved in
the same building by simply dunking
the entire stage in a water tank.
The cast give it their all to make
sure the play succeeds, with the
Monkey Dad and Monkey Daughter
of the captive family of monkeys
(yes, that’s a thing in this play) being
stand-outs amongst the supporting
cast.
Aimee-Ffion Edwards is hugely
endearing as the Daughter, while
Glyn Pritchard makes immediate
efforts to steal the show as the Dad.
The rest of the cast are all game,
and throw everything at it – it’s just
a shame they feel a little let down by
the script.
“Mischievously adapted” feels like
a grand claim here, as the script veers
between the needlessly wordy and
desperately trying to be funny, with
the majority of the humour coming
from the physical rather than the
verbal.
It’s odd, too – the script itself is far
more lively on paper, with some truly
ingenious stage directions. Mrs Twit
is at one point described as “a one-
eyed Scarlett Johansson”, for starters.
The lead performances, meanwhile,
are truly fantastic to watch – Monica
Dolan and Jason Watkins are
spectacular as the Twits, bringing a
manic energy to the whole thing.
The stage fizzles whenever
they appear on it, and they are
responsible for (almost) all of the
play’s best moments, ranging from
a disturbingly rock-and-roll version
of ‘O Little Town of Bethlehem’ to
multiple instances of frying-pan
based violence.
The theme music (essentially
‘twittwitstwitstwits’ repeated over
frenetic guitar strumming and drum
bashing) that accompanies their
arrivals soon grates, however.
It’s one of the most painfully
obvious moments where the play
explicitly targets the younger
segment of the audience, temporarily
alienating the older portion in the
process.
It works for the kids, though:
I caught at least five separate
instances of small children chanting
‘twitstwitstwitstwits’ as the audience
made their way out of the theatre.
Exciting for them, less so for their
parents. I’d say I pity them, but they
did choose to have children.
On a serious note, it’s a genuinely
brilliant thing that The Twits left the
children in the theatre as enthused as
it did.
Most children’s encounters with
the theatre consist of a seasonal
panto (usually of dubious quality),
and then the occasional encounter
with Shakespeare (usually of variable
quality).
It’s vital that children get to see how
exciting, visceral, life-affirming and
generally essential theatre can be,
and so getting them engaged with real
theatre is incredibly important.
That’s not to say that panto isn’t
real theatre, it’s more that The Twits
takes place in the Royal Court, one
of the foremost critically-acclaimed
theatres in the country.
Children enjoying and
remembering a trip here matters,
and hopefully in a few years time, as
they start to develop interests in more
mature works, they’ll come back –
and keep coming back, and help keep
theatre alive.
More than anything else that takes
place in The Twits, that enthuasiasm
it leaves with young children, that
enjoyment for the magic of theatre,
that’s what really counts.
That’s the legacy The Twits will
leave.
But for all that, I just wish it was a
better play
The Twits is on at the Royal Court
until 31st
May. Tickets from £10,
available online.
