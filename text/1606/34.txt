With exams taking hold in the
Central Library,Hangman has
been inundated with requests to
publish your secret crushes on fellow
students.
Handsome guy pulling
pennies from keyboards, I
was the girl laughing when
that guy confronted you
for making his computer
log off automatically. Drink
sometime? You can use your
pennies...
Penny Me Anytime, 2nd
Floor
Hot girl sweating in the
north-east corner of 5th
floor,
I caught your eye after I
punched that guy to get the
last copy of Grey’s Anatomy.
Feel like sweating together?
Hot and Bothered
Fit bird on the 3rd
floor,
wanna come check out my
anatomy?
Sun’s Out, Guns Out
Guy with annoyingly loud
headphones in the Wolfson
suite. I liked your music,
are you up for making some
more with me?
Uptown Funk you Up, 1st
Floor
Dude trying to kick the
pigeons in the Lib Caf: I hate
animals too! Meet me for
a baked potato tomorrow
afternoon?
Not the BUAV
Gorgeous blonde who
smuggled chocolate into the
Library in her bra: baby, I
could be your Milky Way
anytime. Fancy making your
Galaxy spin?
More than a Mouthful
To the trench-coat wearing
man on the 4th
floor. I wilted
when I saw you, how can you
stand the heat? I’d like to see
how much heat you can bear
in the bedroom...
Hot Under the Collar

This week, you are excited to
hear that there will be an even
greater quantity of sausage in
the Union than usual.
That’s right, there’s a hot dog
special on in 568 for one night
only! Hangman hopes you’re
excited, because Hangman is
excited.
Hangman loves sausage.

This week, you make a
reference to “cheeky Nando’s”
to your friends from America.
If you’d make that joke a week
ago, they wouldn’t have got it.
Thanks, Buzzfeed. You’ve
ruined our sense of superiority
over the Yanks.
(Someone just told Hangman “we
still have beans on toast.” Hangman
fucking hates beans on toast.)
This week, you are a pigeon.
An odd man approaches you,
puts you in a sack, and now
students keep trying to touch
you. It’s a bit weird and you’re
not really comfortable with it.
Sadly, you’re a pigeon, so
nobody gives a shit.
(Hangman says: bit like being an
Imperial student, innit?)
This week, you start seeing
Chris Kaye everywhere. You
even think you see him on the
cover of Private ICL.
Are you going mad? Who
knows? Hangman does, but
he’s not telling. Hangman
enjoys fucking with your
mind.
This week, you are Hangman.
For reasons best known to
yourself, you decide to write
the horoscopes yourself this
week.
The result is so
catastrophically terrible you
are immediately fired.
Makes a change from being
fired for “having standards,”
truth be told.
This week, you are Hangman
and you are forced to change
one of your horoscopes by
the Editor. You reflect on
the depressing irony of your
attempts at censorship of your
horoscopes writer then being
censored yourself.
How the tables have turned.
This week, you are an
unfortunate reader of the
horoscopes. You start to notice
a common theme to this week’s
efforts: a weird tendency
towards self-referential
meta commentary on the
horoscopes.
You love it and demand more.
Hangman knows these things.
This week, you are the BUAV.
Someone makes over 180
unfounded allegations against
you, that you are forced to
defend in court. You win.
Sadly for you, they complain
to the High Court and win
their appeal to make their
allegations all over again.
What a bunch of whiny gits.
This week, you are watching
Game of Thrones.
Hangman hasn’t watched
this week’s episode yet, to be
honest, so has no idea what’s
going on here.
Hangman feels obliged to say
something inflammatory, but
to be honest that just feels like
effort.
This week, you are a cowardly,
anonymous Comment writer.
You write an article attacking
the Union for their choice of
Summer Ball headliner.
They find out who you are. You
are never heard from again.
Nice one.
This week you are attacked by
a rabid pigeon. In a fit of pique,
you send a photo of the plague
of avian rodents to Felix, in the
hope that they will run a story
on it.
They put it on the cover of
Private ICL. Sucks to be you.
This week, you are the
horoscopes writer. You send
in this week’s horoscopes, only
to find Hangman has already
written most of them.
Enraged, you pen twelve
more horoscopes all calling
Hangman various unprintable
things.
Hangman runs his horoscopes
instead.
News in Brief: Editor to Hangman: “Make a Game of
Thrones joke and you’re fired.”

News in Brief: Game of Thrones actually very complicated game of musical
chairs.
Genre redefined in California
The moon landing was watched
by over 125 million people
and was heralded as one of the
greatest achievements of our modern
age in both the field of science and of
human progress; however compared
to Azeem’s flute recital- i’m sorry
Neil Armstrong- it was the biggest
pile of wank known to man.
The story of Azeem Ward will
forever be chronicled from twat to
twat wearing JD sports tracksuits,
owns a spiked-up hair cut, and uses
the phrase ‘cheeky’ to describe their
food non-ironically; however until
then, Hangman will detail the story
as it happened. Azeem Ward had
planned to create a facebook event
of his senior flute recital at the
University of California for a few
family and friends to attend at . What
he had not foreseen was that it would
start a viral craze, predominantly
in UK universities, resulting in over
100,000 saying they were going,
50,000 Brits live streaming the flute
recital, and even one particularly
cheeky lad taking a flight to Santa
Barbara.
So flash forward to the 16th
May,
expectations were high: Azeem had
promised us Devienne’s Concerto
No 7, Gaubert’s Sonata No 3 and
Roitstein’s Flautas, as well as the
more contemporary ‘Three Beats for
Beatbox Flute’ with what promised
to be the cheekiest of all flute recitals.
Arriving fashionably late, Azeem
was wearing a black waistcoat with a
striking red shirt, topped off with the
finest hat i have seen in all my years
(M’lady).
Over the next hour and a half,
Azeem bared his soul: he effortlessly
glided through despair, joy, love lost,
love gained, melancholy, all the while
charming the pants off everyone
watching (excluding his mum). He
enthralled the audience even further
by cheekily placing awkwardly long
intermissions in between the pieces,
making all 50,000 of us gagging for
more.
His devil-may-care shoulder
placement of his flute will be what we
remember him for in the centuries
to come: I have a dream that in the
future, everyone will worship a
large vaseline monument of Azeem
on each May 16th. We will chant
the sweet melodious flute beatbox
handed down to us by the great
Ward, and then feast on the cheekiest
Nandos we can produce. Any heretic
that has anything lower than medium
will be forced to commit seppuku on
a sharpened flute, leading to a greater
society…
...Oh yeah, so to summarize the
flute recital was pretty good if you’re
into that kinda thing.
