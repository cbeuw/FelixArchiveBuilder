Joshua Renken finds himself entranced by Mad Max: Fury Road
Far-fetched, messed-up and first class
“Has the world fell? Each of us in our
own way was broken. It was hard to know
who was more crazy; me, or everyone
else.”
Picture the scene. In the distant
future, water wars have
destroyed society, law and
order has broken down and human
civilisation has fallen.
“Mad” Max Rockatansky, played
by Tom Hardy, is a lone survivor
in the arid desert wastelands of
Australia. Captured by the ‘War Boys’
– led by King Immortan Joe (Hugh
Keays-Byrne) – Max is designated a
universal blood donor and used as
a blood bag for the weak War Boy
Nux (Nicholas Hault). Elsewhere,
Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron)
drives her weaponised War Rig oil
tanker to collect gasoline – a resource
now far less coveted than water.
Furiosa veers her War Rig off the
predetermined route in an attempt
to escape, alerting King Immortan
Joe who realises that his five wives –
specially selected for breeding – have
also legged it.
Immortan leads his entire fleet
of vehicles and War Boys in hot
pursuit of Furiosa and his wives.
He’s particularly keen on getting his
child – who he hopes is a son – out
of his favourite wife, played by Rosie
Huntington-Whiteley. The casting
decisions suggest that Fury Road is
going to be as terrible as Transformers,
but mercifully this is not even
remotely the case.
That is the set-up. I will not unravel
any more of the plot, which is just
as well because I don’t think I could
continue if I tried. Essentially Mad
Max: Fury Road is a prison break
turned chase action thriller centred
on the cooperation of slaves (of
different kinds) in a desperate bid
for freedom. Or put another way,
it’s about a cult leader with the
face of a scrotum searching for his
desert bitches in a post-apocalyptic
wasteland. Take your pick.
This film is set in one of the bleakest
dystopias in film history, inhabited
by tyrannical Aussie mercenaries,
Aussie slaves, Tom Hardy and King
Immortan – a sadistic overlord who
looks like the lovechild of Peter
Jackson’s Sauron and Christopher
Nolan’s Bane.
Along the way we meet demented
Immortan-worshipping skinheads
with full white body paint, who love
nothing more than spraying their
mouths with a silver elixir from an
aerosol can, before dying for their
cause in front of ‘witnesses’. This
inspired act of martyrdom is all done
with the expectation of gaining safe
passage through the gates of Valhalla
with Immortan.
(I don’t know what Immortan
has promised them in Valhalla.
Perhaps flexible working hours in the
afterlife?)
In this two-hour blaze of spears
and fire, there is close to no character
development. I still don’t know for
sure whether it’s just me, or whether
this is what most action films are
like, but Fury Road seems to offer no
insights to the audience about Max,
Furiosa or Nux.
Max experiences unexplained
visions of children and the elderly,
both living and dead, who all seem
angry at him. These moments clearly
haunt Max, but they are never
explored.
Fury Road is one of the first films
I’ve ever watched with barely any
memorable dialogue. The two best
lines come from Max, both of which
are uttered in the first five minutes of
the film.
Despite the pretense and
suggestions of profundity, Fury
road is really quite a dumb film. It’s
just an excuse for the directors and
cinematographers to capture big,
vehicular orgies of oil, explosions,
death and metal in pornographic
detail.
I watched Mad Max in 2D, and
needed to lie down for the rest of the
evening. God knows what it’s like in
3D. Probably life-altering.
You can’t help but be in awe of
the imagination of the psychopath/
cinematographer that managed to put
it all together. In all the warfare there
is a crunchy physicality to the sounds
of the gunshots, explosions and
engines. I can’t quite explain it, but
every action by the lead characters are
somehow more visceral than in other
comparatively bland action films.
Tom Hardy is excellent as Mad Max,
playing the primitive survivor – who
seems to communicate exclusively
in threats – to a T. His previous roles
in The Dark Knight Rises, Bronson and
Warrior all come together in a glorious
exhibition of acting prowess.
Many critics have said that the
real star of the film is Charlize
Theron, who plays the Oil Rig driver
and all round badass Furiosa. Fury
Road has even been heralded as a
‘feminist film’ that shines a beacon of
female empowerment against male
oppression. And when you watch it,
you can see why.
For the first time ever I think I’m
more puzzled after watching this film
than when I first saw the trailer. This
might just be because I desperately
want to know just what the hell is
going on, when really this film is best
enjoyed when the viewer excepts the
madness of the plot.
Logic is kryptonite to a Mad Max
audience. So if you do watch this film,
and I sincerely hope that you do, don’t
even try to follow. You will have lots
of questions after watching the trailer.
Alas, the film yields little in the way
of explanation.
Perhaps the most amazing thing
of all about Mad Max: Fury Road,
however, is that the director George
Miller’s last film before creating this
towering cinematic masterpiece was, I
shit you not, Happy Feet Two.
I don’t know what possessed – and
I use that word carefully – Miller to
create such a spectacular display of
noise and nonsense. Mad Max: Fury
Road occupies a world of blood, fire,
sand and oil.
It is a truly mesmerising odyssey
likely inspired by a ketamine-induced
dream sequence that turned into a
really, really bad trip. It really is that
bleak. Memorable, certainly. But
bleak.
If nothing else, Mad Max: Fury
Road reminds us that we could be
living in a world of naked barbarism,
rogue armies, sacrificial cults, sandy
wastelands and scarce resources, when
in fact we get to live a life of taxes,
Sainsbury’s and Angry Birds. And for
that reason, I absolutely love it.
