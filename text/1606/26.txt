In Conversation:
Ian MacNeil
Ian MacNeil is the set designer for
Everyman, currently on at the National
Theatre. Directed by Rufus Norris, the
new Director of the National, and starring
Academy Award-winning Chiwetel
Ejiofor, the play runs until 30th
August.
Ian’s previous work includes the likes of
Billy Elliot: The Musical, for which he won
the Tony Award for Best Scenic Design
of a Musical, and critically acclaimed
An Inspector Calls, which won an Olivier
Award for Best Set Design.
Felix Arts’ Jack Steadman caught up with
Ian during the run of Everyman for a chat
about his work on the show, as well as a
look back at his career.

Jack Steadman: What was your
inspiration for the design of
Everyman?
Ian MacNeil: We looked at
medieval, allegorical drawings and
illuminations. They have what looks
like an empty drum, with a sheer side
to it, sitting in the earth, and then
there’s a hole that’s a pure cylinder.
There are figures – people of the
world – that are falling into it, but at
the same time there are figures that
are rising out of it. I guess that’s the
most important thing.
The other thing is that Carol Ann
[Duffy, who adapted Everyman] is a
poet, obviously, so I thought it would
be interesting to make it seem as
though there were nothing on stage so
that you listened to the poetry.
Because it’s set in the present
day, we wanted [Everyman] to be
a recognisable person. We’d say
he was in London, he was wealthy,
and he probably worked in Soho.
That would explain his friends, and
what was it generally feels like. [We
wanted] to explain in a subliminal
way, not an illustrated way – that
was the key thing, to not actually
illustrate, but to give the atmosphere,
to make it feel like you’re in Soho
with beautiful neon light, or street
lights, or whatever, in the rain. So it’s
subliminal, but that’s what the floor
and the LED screen are trying to feel
like.
JS: Do you feel the design worked
in the end?
IM: Well, one does these things,
and one does them as best one can
and tries to be clear without words,
meaning that audience don’t hear you
talk about it, they come and look at
it. A design’s a thing that has to speak
without words: not speak, convey
atmosphere, make you feel things and
be an environment that things can
fair enough. So, successful or not, I
feel alright about it.
JS: I thought it was fantastic, I
really enjoyed seeing it in action.
With regards to the process for
Everyman – were you involved with
Rufus Norris [the director] & Carol
Ann from the start?
IM: I’ve known Rufus for a very long
time, we’ve done quite a few shows
together. It was [originally] a different
play, which didn’t get delivered, it
missed the deadline, so then he chose
to do this. He made the decision, and
then we were in a meeting ten days
later.
For Carol Ann, he gave her this
whole thing to do without a particular
set of instructions. She did all of it,
and then he met her, which I thought
was quite a smart thing to do; she
could get a draft out, and then there
could be a thing to respond to. Then
there were two weeks of workshop,
separated by a month or so, with
actors, where ideas were tested. By
the first workshop, we had an idea of
the design, which was a bit different
from how it now is. For the second
workshop, I think we had this design.
So I sat in the workshops and watched
them choreograph, really, and test
some text. And that’s quite fun,
because you’re all working at the same
time. There’s not a lot one can do
oneself, but being there, part of the
atmosphere, seeing the choreography
and the language of it – I can’t say
how it helped, but it does, the more
you are feeling like you’re all trying
to do the same piece, the better. That’s
the danger of these things, you’re all
trying to do a different piece.
There were quite a few meetings of
just me, Rufus and Nicky [Gillibrand],
the costume designer. She was at all
our meetings. There’re times when
only costumes are telling you what’s
going on, and scenery is not, and [it]
takes a lot of trust on everybody’s
part to decide amongst you who has
responsibility at any given moment.
It’s quite a job, and I really enjoy that
bit, because it involves a lot of trust,
not just people going off on their own
and producing an outcome, but you’re
all together. You can decide what you
think about it, but how you manifest
it, how you make it understandable to
an audience is a lot of work. It’s quite
vulnerable work, so to have colleagues
that you care about and respect and
that you can be vulnerable in front of
is great.
JS: So Everyman was at the National,
how does that compare to other
theatres, other shows, even other
countries that you’ve worked in?
IM: I try and work in theatres that
are supportive of the kind of things
I just described. I work quite hard to
be welcomed in those places, where
you don’t have to know everything
"A design is
a thing that
has to speak
without
words, to
convey an
atmosphere"
"It’s quite a
job, and it
involves a
lot of trust
... you’re
all in it
together"
