Philippa Skett reports as student who prints his reviews leads protests
Homeless Book Critic evicted from alley
by police near Parsons Green
An Imperial student has
reached out to homeless man
Mark Burns, 43, by publishing
his book reviews online. Mark lives in
a tent in the alleyway behind a tube
stop, and reads and reviews books
given to him by passing commuters.
However it seems that he may not
be able to retain his regular reading
spot behind Parsons Green station,
as police have warned him he must
move on or face jail time.
Farah Shair, a second year
biochemist who lives near the Parsons
Green station, maintains “The
Homeless Book Critic” blog, and takes
reviews from Mark to post online.
She also types up diary entries and
has shed some light on Mark’s past,
telling his story of how he has ended
up on the streets.
Farah told Felix: “I noticed Mark
sitting behind the station reading on
my way to university, and thought it
was interesting how he always had a
book in his hand.
I started talking to him and he is
really nice, and I thought it would
be a great way to help him out by
publishing his reviews online.”
However Mark was arrested on
Tuesday night for allegedly blocking
the public walkway, and spent the
night in a cell. His books were taken
away and have not been returned
to him, and he was left without his
tent and sleeping bag overnight
before they were returned to him the
following morning.
The alleyway is property of TfL,
and although those who work at the
station have told police he is welcome
to stay, residents of the properties
overlooking the alleyway are not so
happy about Mark setting up camp
there.
A BBC report covering Mark
featured an interview with Audrey,
who was scared Mark would climb
over into the garden: “I don’t think
anyone would be happy with someone
at their back door... It’s very insecure.”
Some of the residents have been
repeatedly reporting Mark to the
police as a result, often accusing him
of anti-social behaviour.
However, Mark said to the BBC: “I
think it’s a joke considering I don’t do
nothing wrong. I sit here and I read
a book I don’t give anyone any grief
and I make sure I keep the alleyway
clean.”
He also told the Big Issue in an
interview published this week: “I
think a certain neighbour was saying
I’m causing problems, but everyone
round here knows I’m not doing that.
I collect up all my stuff and don’t
leave any rubbish. When the police
took me away they asked if those were
my books. I said, ‘Well, no – they’re
for everyone.’ So I suppose they didn’t
consider them my belongings.”
Mark has been told now that if he
stays in the alleyway longer than four
hours, he will be arrested.
A quiet demonstration, featuring
several students and friends of Farah,
took place on Wednesday after Mark
was told to move to show support
for Mark. Their peaceful protest also
made it onto the BBC news, and even
attracted support from local celebrity
Jamie Lang, a star from the reality
television program Made In Chelsea.
Jamie told the BBC: “If he’s not
harassing the local community -
which Mark wasn’t at all - then why
kick him out if he’s not abusing
anyone? There’s just no need for it.”
Mark is still in the area, but,
without a spot to make camp, he also
doesn’t have a spot to keep his books.
Farah hosts a Facebook page for
Mark, and posted to see if anyone in
the area knows of a secure location he
can set up a new library.
The page has nearly 900 likes and is
inundated with comments showing
support for Mark. One poster recently
commented: “Mark is one of the
nicest people I’ve met in Parsons
Green! I’m a local resident and really
enjoy chatting with him.
“The builders who gather there
are the real problem; urinating and
drinking etc. One time, a terrible
fight broke out and I felt so scared as
they were all huge men, very drunk
and I got stuck trying to walk past
them.
“Thankfully, Mark was quietly
reading and I knew if something
terrible had happened he’d have
helped me.”
Farah now plans to raise enough
money to buy Mark a van, in which he
can live, read and hopefully sell books
from in the future. Mark also hopes to
use the van to travel to other areas of
London to provide vital support for
those that are also sleeping rough by
talking to them, encouraging them to
read and highlighting the problems of
being homeless.
Mark, who was born in
Hammersmith, has been homeless
for three years. After spending some
time in Chiswick, he settled into
the alleyway behind Parsons Green
and has been happily camping and
reading there for nearly a year.
Farah concluded: “Some people
have asked me why I am only helping
one homeless person, and say “ “Well,
there are lots of homeless people in
London, why are you not helping
those too?”
“Obviously I am aware there are lots
of homeless people in the city, but I
am only one person and can only do
so much.
“Hopefully by sharing Mark’s
reviews and presenting maybe this
other side to him that people may not
see, I can challenge preconceptions
people may have about the homeless
and raise awareness of the problems a
lot of homeless people face.”
