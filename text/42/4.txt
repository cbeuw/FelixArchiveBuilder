Dear Sir,
There was much written in the last "Felix',
and much has been lately said in the college,
about the lack of I .C, . participation in organised
rags. The obvious solution to this problem is
the institution of an official rag committee. We
know that other col leges possess them and the neerrt'
for one in I . C . . i s self-evident.
I belivve that I speak for a large number of
others, as I know it was definitely intended to
raise the matter at the last Guilds' Union meeting,
had not time intervened. ^
Disorganised riots have their points, but I
am quite certain that organised rags achieve
better results and are usually more entertaining,
and we may be quite certain that without organ-
isation we shall not reach our proper position,
consistently at the head of University act ivit ies.
In any case it is time that some of the peace lov-
ing officials realised that they cannot prevent
rags by taking no part in them, and that by taking
a hand themselves, they may well guide the rags
away from some of the dreadful consequences they
seem to fear.
To organise a rag inafull union meeting would
be an awkward procedure, impossible in the time
available, and so I propose in open letter that
I.C. should have a full time, democratically elec-
ted rag committee, composed of enterprising, and
yet fairly responsible, individuals, for, if such
a thing ever existed in I.C.,,it died some years
back and not even its grave is now in evidence
{'unless some archaeologist would like to sort
about in our history in order to con found me).
Yours Faithfully ,
D. J. HIGSON
Si r ,
It is quite obvious from the general ,feeling
at the last I.C. Union Meeting etc. that the main
body of students within the union are tired of
being repressed annually by s u c c e s s i v e P r e s i d e n t s
on Guy Fawkes day, and are in favour of an I.C..
rag, on a well organised basis.
, 4 s one of your correspondents suggests, what
is wanted now is less talk and more action.
But unfortunately, we cannot have the one
without the other, so I suggest that, (next year
being Coronation year), a committee is immedi-
ately set up to examine the possibility of holding,
and the organisat ion of, a charity rag or a car-
nival through the streets of London, early in the
New Year. So that this venture should be fos-
tered from the top, the committee should be elected
by council from nominations posted on the union
board in the usual way. A rag of this type would
require thorough organisation so no time should be
lost.
If leadership had been forthcoming some weeks
prior to Guy Fawkes day, Harlington would have been
empty and I,C. would have been in their proper
place in the University Rag. As it was, nothing
futher was heard, after all the talk of the
meeting, and hundreds turned to Harlington for want
of something better.
Come on I.C., wake up and let's make 1953 a
really 'Imperial' year. D. INMAN.
Dear Sir,
In the last issue of 'Felix' we wre told
that College newspaers are to give more promi-
nence to U.L..activities • a very laudable inten-
tion and yet, in the same issue, there is not one
other mention of University of London, except on
the Sports page,
I cannot imagine that nothing worth report-
ing has occurred in the other Colleges during the
past fortnight, indeed a report on the two pre-
vious U.L. Debates was submitted but not pub-
lished, ostensibly due to lack of space, in spite
of a whole page beting devoted to sport each week.
At a time when the only solut ion to the grave
problems which beset the world is a resurgence of
critical and constructive thought in mankind, it
seems more than unfortunate that so much promi-
nence is given to those act ivit ies which directly
prevent this ren aissanc e .
Can it be that 'Felix' does not know what its
readers require, or does she copy her policy
directly from the commercial press, or is the
mentality of the students at Imperial College
really no higher than that of readers of the
cheap dailies?
Yours faithfully,
ROGER FISHES ( 2C)
Dear Sir,
The blood transfusion for student societies
announced in the last 'Felix' is likely to prove
to be of the wrong group, with the usual fatal
result. It i s not possible for the student so-
cieties to be part of the General Studies Scheme
as it new stands without their losing their iden-
tities. If they organise meetings with the help
of the college authorities in finding speakers
they are acting as middlemen instead of primary
pr oducers. In a General Studies lecture the con-
ditions are such that the audience is largely
passive; the shortness of the time, the size of
the audience participation which, I suggest,is
a very important feature of student society
meetings .
This difference in character between the
two types of meeting means that they must be kept
separate and some solution, such as starting at
9.30 every day, must be found to preserve both
of them.
Yours etc. ,
i.e.
Sir,
It is now over half a century since Guilds
last purchased a motor-car, (Boanerges 1901), and
we feel that it is time a more modern, yet equally
outstanding mascot is acquired.
We therefore regret the bargain recently
missed by the Motor Club - a B.R.M. would have
made a fitting successor to "Bo", having a
similar standard of reliability but less seating
capacity. A "Bo' body fitted to a B.R.M. chassis
wo uld have overcome this.
Failing this, we undestand that the Dockers '
Gold Daimler is now on the second-hand car market.
' Yours faithfully,
"WHITE ELEPHANTS'
