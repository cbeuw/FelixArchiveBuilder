2 FELIX
I t i s customary t o ' P r o f i l e ' the R e t i r i n g E d i t o r o f
FELIX. A f t e r a l l , the E d i t o r , while i n o f f i c e , can
have considerable i n f l u e n c e over the Union: h i s views
are as important as those o f most Union o f f i c e r s . Thus
i t comes about that Stephen H. Wearne (the H. i s s a i d t o
stand for Hobft) faces the ordeal of exposure by an u n -
f l a t t e r i n g biographer.
S. H . W. spent an u n s e t t l e d e a r l y l i f e at boarding
school and with r e l a t i o n s , developing a considerable
degree of independence and a d a p t a b i l i t y . Owning nowhere
as home, he chooses London as the only place where he i s
r e a l l y comfortable. Apprenticed at 16 t o the De
H a v i l l a n d S c h o o l , he l e f t a f t e r 7 months to become an
a r t i c l e d apprentice t o a London f i r m . His factory ex-
periences showed him some o f the f r u s t r a t i o n s o f 'shop
work, and gave h i s p o l i t i c s a t i l t from t h e i r r i g h t wing
p u b l i c school tendencies. He d i d part time studying at
a t e c h n i c a l c o l l e g e , from where he won a scholarship to
Woolwich P o l y t e c h n i c , a f t e r having the unusual e x p e r i -
ence of being Union S e c r e t a r y , and winding up a Union
at the end of i t s emergency (war) f u l l - t i m e student
support. At Woolwich he rose to l s t Class Honours by
way o f magazine E d i t o r , V i c e - P r e s i d e n t , (sinecure) and
various s o c i a l club j o b s . He wrote a radio s c r i p t for
Russian consumption t e l l i n g of the l i f e and prospects
o f an E n g l i s h t e c h n i c a l student. T r a v e l s i n France,
Norway and Sweden produced a book of remeniscences, u n -
published as y e t .
Back i n o f f i c e work, he found that h i s heart was i n
h y d r a u l i c s so he got a Bursary t o G u i l d s , and duly
obtained h i s D . I . C . He wrote a report f o r the t e c h n i -
c a l press on h i s Spanish water power vac. work i n ' 5 1 ,
but denies having further ambition i n the s c i e n t i f i c
j o u r n a l i s t l i n e .
At I . C . , he d i d n ' t l i k e being a f r e s h e r , so he stayed
out of t h i n g s u n t i l h i s eye was caught by a FELIX appeal
for labour. He j o i n e d as a w r i t e r , and a prodigious
volume of work has since f a l l e n from h i s pen. H i s prose
i s " d i s t i n c t i v e and even unpolished" according t o h i s
own d e s c r i p t i o n , but he also uses h i s e a r l y draughtsman-
ship t r a i n i n g t o good account. Maps and headlines are
often h i s work. For l i g h t a r t i c l e s he uses the
pseudonym "Imp", while h i s more serious work i s charac-
t e r i s e d by a d i s p l a y of semicolons; a hsb i t which the
new E d i t o r has caught from him.
I t was i n e v i t a b l e t h a t he should become E d i t o r ; and
at the beginning of t h i s session i t was n a t u r a l that he
should take the job a second time t o organise the
wreckage of the l a s t Board, a f t e r the disappearance of
the E d . E l e c t . He confesses to f i n d i n g FHLIX E d i t i n g
f r u s t r a t i n g ; there i s too much managing to be done;
not enough w r i t i n g and too much r o u t i n e .
He i s a keen boat-clubman. A f t e r 2 weeks as cox
(no previous experience) he was thrown out o f the
Guilds '51 Lowry crew, but t h i s year was i n i t and won.
Fond o f D e l i u s , Mozart, Brahms, Josh. White, and many
others,he d i s l i k e s reading novels (Waste of t i m e " ) ,
has an unuaually strong fear o f war, i s i n t e r e s t e d i n
most t h i n g s , i s very s e n s i t i v e to c r i t i c i s m , hates
facetious a r t i c l e s ("they must be w i t t y or s e n s i b l e " )
and has an abominable t a s t e i n puns. U n l i k e the average
F e l i c i a n Boss, he doesn't want t o w r i t e a play ("there
are enough a l r e a d y " ) . On ' P r o f i l e s ' he says, with
c h a r a c t e r i s t i c s p r i g h t l i n e s s , "The subject should see i t
before i t i s p r i n t e d . "

s e l f immensely and we view with deep s u s p i c i o n any sug-
g e s t i o n that he has not made the whole t h i n g up. Never-

' THE J E A L O U S W I F E "
A COMEDY
BY GEORGE COLMAN
D E C E M B E R IOth-I3th 7 . 3 0 r m .
V A C . W O R K C O M M I T T E E
The Autumn Term meeting of the Union Vacation Work
Committee was h e l d on the 11th November. It l a s t e d
ij- hours, spending most of t h i s time i n discussions on
P u b l i c i t y , Insurance, standards of f i r m s ' t r a i n i n g
programmes and complaints concerning students going
abroad. The meeting was attended by i t s f u l l member-
s h i p : Professor Levy, the Chairman, and the eight other
senior members of the s t a f f representing the departments;
together w i t h an F . B . I , r e p r e s e n t a t i v e for i n d u s t r y ,
the two Union C o u n c i l student members, and the Secretary,
Mr. Newby. F i r s t the Annual Report t o the c o l l e g e
Governing Body and I . C . Union C o u n c i l , and an abstract
form of i t for press r e l e a s e , were approved, and the
committee t h e n r e c e i v e d r e p o r t s of v a r i o u s d e t a i l s o f
the I n t e r n a t i o n a l and home working of the scheme l a s t
year.
A r i s i n g from c e r t a i n accidents to a few students, from
various c o u n t r i e s , abroad l a s t year, the costs and bene-
f i t s o f some Insurances were d i s c u s s e d . I t was agreed
t o recommend s t r o n g l y , but not i n s i s t on, s i c k n e s s ,
i n d u s t r i a l and t r a v e l insurance to a l l students going
overseas. Since the majority o f students r e g i s t e r i n g
for next year had already r e p l i e d , to a suggestion made
t o each, t h a t they were i n t e r e s t e d i n such cover, the
committee were happier about making t h i s a stronger p r o -
p o s a l , than they were on how to meet one further l i a b i l i t y :
the need f o r a fund t o a s s i s t i n the expenses incurred
following serious or f a t a l i l l n e s s of the student abroad.
Such would not be covered by the reasonable premiums o f
the recommended insurance, and would cost much more t o
cover. A p r o p o s a l was therefore made t h a t the Union, or
the committee, set up a fund for such (very rare) cases,
l e v y i n g a small sum, say 2 / - , from each student going
abroad, t o form the fund. The Union representatives
agreed t o put t h i s idea before the Union.
The massive d e t a i l o f the report - a copy of which
i s i n the L i b r a r y - b o i l down to some i n t e r e s t i n g numbers:
a t o t a l of 488 students went abroad from t h i s country last
summer, from 25 c o l l e g e s and u n i v e r s i t i e s , i n c l u d i n g 119
from I . C . In exchange 602 came i n , B r i t a i n being one of
the f i v e countries of the seventeen, t h a t r e c e i v e s more
students than they send out. The y e a r ' s t o t a l m u l t i -
l a t e r a l exchanges t o t a l l e d 3493.
Nearly 80 reports by I . C . students, of t h e i r e x p e r i -
ences abroad t h i s year, have now been evaluated, and these
i n d i c a t e t h a t "the r e s u l t s s t i l l obtained are o f a very
h i g h l e v e l . "

T h i s y e a r ' s Boat Club Dinner was held two days a f t e r
Morphy Day, and i t was perhaps the fact that your r e -
p o r t e r thus d i d not a r r i v e t i r e d from r a c i n g and an a f t e r -
noon's beer t h a t r e s u l t e d i n h i s enjoying i t only i n parts.
However i t was b e t t e r than l a s t y e a r ' s a l l - t i m e low i n
Refectory d i n n e r s : the meal was worth what the committee
p a i d f o r i t
About 100 attended, i n c l u d i n g some 25 guests. Among
those with t h e i r p r i v a t e p i n o f beer - Bar b i t t e r only -
were the v i c t o r i o u s Guilds Morphy and Lowry crews. The
Captain o f Thames R . C . , RR. Swatton, presented them w i t h
t h e i r Cups and Pots; and also the winners o f the club
small-boat competitions w i t h t h e i r cups:
T i z a r d Challenge Cup f o r Senior S c u l l s - R.G. Seaman
Webber Challenge Cup for J u n i o r S c u l l s - I.M. T i t c h e n e r
Lindsay Memorial Cup for Novice S c u l l s - A.R. Saunders
Wynne-Finch Cup for P a i r Oars -
J . P . Gibson & I.M. T i t c h e n e r
The t o a s t t o "The Club"was proposed as u i u a l by
Charles Bristow. He r e f e r r e d t o the fine race given to
the Guilds by the Miie s, and he was g r e a t l y cheered i n
h i s p r a i s e f o r the stout e f f o r t s made by the two R . C . S .
crews against the odds. H i s t a l k l a s t e d the s u r p r i s -
i n g l y snappy time of 22 minutes. The C a p t a i n , P.D.R.
M a l t l e y , took up C h a r l e s ' o u t l i n e of the h i s t o r y and
aims of the Club concerning the past and present year.
H i s survey included the l o s s of the Walton Thames Cup,
but the r e g a i n o f the Sabin Tankard - which ghastly
t w o - g a l l o n (a capacity i t s sole v i r t u e ) trophy was there
on the t a b l e .
The V i c e - C a p t a i n , Geoff Seaman, then proposed "xne
Thames Rowing Club" - the f o s t e r parents, taken so much
f o r granted by I . C . , who provide bar and t e a f a c i l i -
t i e s for u s , and who i n exchange receive the worn-out
I . C . oarsmen when they leave c o l l e g e . "Swatt" i n
r e p l y had only four minutes voioe l e f t - from umpiring
the races on Wednesday - and made a speech i n i t . One
would t h i n k t h a t the Morphy Day behaviour o f I . C . ' s
supporters had never been n o t i c e d .
P e t e r GibBon, the S e c r e t a r y , then proposed "The
Guests", by short references t o each of them. Derek
Coomber i n reply made the popular speech o f the evening
with f o r m a l i t i e s p r o p e r l y s a i d and jokes o f no content
w e l l t o l d .
The company then r e t i r e d f o r the remaining hour i n
the bar. But the sing-song was n o i s y . Perhaps
everyone f e l t they had t o catch up i n the hour an even-
i n g wasted on t a l k , and were t r y i n g t o repeat the good
long evening's v o i c e o f Wednesday. However, by t h a t time
your correspondent and o t h e r , more s e n i o r , coxswains
present were beyond s t e e r i n g the course.
