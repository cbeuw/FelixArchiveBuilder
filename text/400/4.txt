ies? Having reached a decision on these
points, we fertilise a human egg with any
human sperm in a test tube, remove its
nucleus and instead inject into the egg a
Harold Wilson, Feinberg or neo-Monroe
nucleus extracted from the white blood
c e l l s of these characters. T h i s egg w i l l
be inserted into a foster mother where
it w i l l become an embryo and, after the
usual nine months, there w i l l be born an
identical twin of Harold Wilson, Feinberg
or Monroe. T h e enucleation of the
fertilised eggs and the injection o f the
special nuclei w i l l be done by Japanese
experts (because they are so pre-eminent
at micro-manipulation), paid much more,
of course, than our Prime Minister.
It is not difficult to realise that these
operations w i l l pose rather difficult
questions for the C o m m i s s i o n . Do we
really want a thousand Feinbergs?
Personally I would prefer a few C r i c k s ,
troublesome as he sometimes i s ; and you
may not w i s h to have so many Harold
Wilsons around, and prefer some Chou en
L a i ' s . Needless to s a y , the Monroe
analogues present different but, perhaps,
more interesting problems. That the
operation c a n be done and, therefore,
according to A C C l a r k e , w i l l be done,
seems to me a certainty.
Teaspoonfull of a poison, easily
produced by special germs, can kill
everyone in London.
I turn now to another aspect of biology
in your lifetime: genetic engineering. Of
course, you w i l l soon have bacteria
" t r a i n e d " to produce currently expensive
chemicals like insulin and prostaglandin
quite cheaply. But there is potentially,
an unpleasant side to genetic engineering
and again, I fear, we drift into the
military or geopolitical sphere. It seems
certain that, again in your lifetime, genes
controlling toxins such as those of
cholera and botulinus w i l l be able to be
put into the bacterium E, coli, a normal
inhabitant of most human intestines.
Deliberately or inadvertently, this could
cause appalling trouble. A teaspoon ful.1
of botulinus toxin is enough to kill
everyone in London. F o r comparison, a
teaspoon full of cyanide, usually thought
of as a very deadly poison, would only
k i l l a busload of people. Although some
people think the dangers associated with
genetic engineering are exaggerated, I am
sure this subject should not and w i l l not
merely be left to the good sense of us
s c i e n t i s t s , even though some nice things,
to d o with nitrogen fixation and food, and
with animo-plants, w i l l happen apart from
the malevolent p o s s i b i l i t i e s to which I
I have referred.
Broadly speaking t h e n . y o u w i l l have to
be satisfied, during your lifetime, with
the biological systems that evolution has
happened to produce on earth. From now
on, others w i l l be possible, by human
intervention: that is to say, evolution
w i l l be by-passed or short-circuited.
Cutting out m i l l i o n s of years of trial and

Possibility of deep-freezing astronauts
for long journeys into outer space.
I referred earlier to the idea, popular
among futurologists and some s c i e n t i s t s ,
that population pressures on earth can or
w i l l be alleviated or solved by d i s p a t c h -
ing people to outer space. Y o u c a n , I
believe, forget about going far enough out
into space to have much chance of
meeting intelligent beings because the
almost inconceivable s i z e of the universe
and the velocity of light restrict the
probability of such a meeting to the
neighbourhood of z e r o . A s I am sure you
know, the Special Theory of Relativity
does not preclude objects, tachyons for
example, travelling faster than light; but
then they cannot travel slower. Conversely,
things - us and our containers — which
travel slower than light, cannot ever

travel f a s t e r . So the only way to get a
reasonable but not e x c e s s i v e distance
from earth, say a thousand light years or
about 6,000 teramiles (excuse me
mentioning that the prefix tera means a
million m i l l i o n or 10 to the power of 12),
the only way would be by deep-freezing
the explorers in their spaceship and
warming them up just before arrival by a
delayed defrost command from within the
spaceship (not, of course, from earth).
The inmates of the spaceship would,
naturally, be re-deep-frozen for the
return journey. But there is a difficulty
about this idea, which in any case would
make no dent in our population problem.
The difficulty is that even if one could
deep-freeze a human being without killing
him or her, the warming-up process would
almost certainly turn the subject into an
idiot, because our brains do not respond
well to freezing ftnd thawing.

The results are rather disheartening.
