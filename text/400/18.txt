Imperial College 1st XI 2
University College Hospital 1 by Jim Marshall
The remaining members of last years 1st XI viewed this
fixture with considerable interest as U C H knocked us out of
the London University C u p in the first round last year, and inthe
corresponding league match last year we were lucky to hold
them to a draw.
In employing a different
formation of four forwards,
three in midfield, two defenders
and a sweeper, the idea was
to have a strong base at the
back and to u t i l i s e the
considerable speed of our
forwards on the break. Much
to everyones surprise this
worked, with IC blocking the
midfield, not allowing the U C H
forwards any space. I C ' s first
goal, though s l i g h t l y lucky,
was deserved, the ball
rebounding off the post only to
be put in by their goal keeper.
Lifted by the goal IC continued
to. put pressure on the U C H
defence and five minutes
before half time scored the
best goal of the game. From a
break down the right wing, the
centre was neatly flicked into
the goal by Trev Tutu.Leading
by two goals at half time,
everything seemed to be
working fine and for fifteen
minutes after the break IC
continued as before; However
;-3lightly casual play indefence
by IC and good anticipation by
a U C H forward resulted in U C H
pulling a goal back. Pressure
was applied to the IC defence
for a considerable period which
included several short corners
and one of which was w e l l
saved with a neat leg glance
by J i m Marshall. Towards the
end of the game IC got back on
top but no more goals were
forthcoming.
T h i s was a good performance
with the whole team playing

Royal College of Pharmacy 2
A s everyone turned up on
time, tor once, the mixed
team arrived at Pharmacy an
hour early, so there was a
lengthy warm-up before the
game. When it eventually
started, it turned out to be
an excellent match. . The
first half yielded a goal for
each side, C h a s Hardy
s c o r i n g from a short corner
for IC. In the secqnd half,
the game swung from end to
end, with IC managing to
grab the lead, but only for a
short w h i l e , Pharmacy
quickly replying with what
was the goal of the match.
U . L . 6-a-side H o c k e y
Venue:- Motspur Park Imperial College lis
Despite, or because of, the
departure of the IC captain
and 1st Team early on in the
proceedings, the IC 2nd's
proceeded convincingly to win
its first two matches, C h a s
Hardy scoring most of the
goals. Due to a " s l i g h t " lack
of fitness (and the missing of
an open goal by C B H ) we only
won the quarter-final match on
corners. The semi-final proved
too much for this gallant
band and despite two goals
from out of the blue to draw
the score line, we lost on
cornets. The L S E won the
tournament.

A s the score suggests this
was a disappointing game for
both s i d as, nei ther team ga i n i ng
any superiority over the other.
From our point of view, the
game was spoilt by the t a c k l i n g
methods employed by the U C
defence. When on a number of
o c c a s i o n s a forward broke
through he was savagely
brought down from behind. The
play o s c i l l a t e d between both
ends with very few clear cut
chances created, the defences
coming out on top. Both-John
Andrews and A l i s t e r R o s s had
good games in midfield,
e s p e c i a l l y John who has done
a great job playing out of
position. T h i s was a gritty
performance from a team which
is finding it difficult to settle
down, but shows considerable
promise.

Imperial College 1st XI 1
Borough Road College 1st XI 1
Having collected four
points from our first two
league matches the 1st XI
trauched to Borough Road
College on Saturday to try
and make it s i x out of a
p o s s i b l e s i x . However IC
started slowly and B R C
gained t h e advantage,
dominating the midfield.
After 10 minutes B R C were
awarded a penalty stroke
which they duly converted,
C h a r l i e Brown in goal being
penalized for an i l l e g a l
clearance. B R C continued to
apply pressure right through
the half, but dogged defence
kept them out. After the
interval, the roles changed,
IC for the first time applied
constant pressure, Trev Tutu,
and Mike Isles looking
dangerous at the front.
A good move involving
Mike and Trev resulted in
Trev being knocked down in
the ' D ' (shooting area) and
Kim Houlden scored from the
penalty f l i c k . After this IC
pressurised the B R C defence
but were unable to break
through due to good work by
their goalkeeper.
T h i s was an excellent
hard working performance
with s p e c i a l credit due to
A l l e n Brown, A l i s t e r R o s s and
Kim Houlden.

Ten IC stalwarts eventually arrived in the deep South to play
a bunch of cowboys and ex-convicts from Surrey. Right from the
start IC realised they were up against a team p o s s e s s i n g a l l the
qualities that made N a z i Germany great, and at half-time the
score stood at 2—0 to the home side . In the second half IC
built up pressure and a l l four forwards came c l o s e to s c o r i n g a
number of times before Balderson netted from five centimetres.
There was no further score although, in goal, C a r l i l e made
a fine save with his left ear-lobe in the dying seconds.

Sunday, 26th October saw
the annual run of the Club to
the 'Evening News Race Of
The South at Brands Hatch'.
The weather was kind and so
was luck, only one or two
members' go lost! We a l l
arrived in time for the first
race, scheduled for 12.30pm.
The racing was c l o s e and
e x c i t i n g and provided good
value for money. The first
superbike race was won by
Barry Ditchburn on the Works
Kawasaki (of course)-
by a
mile. Patrick Pons put up a
good show as did John
Williams on the works
Suzuki.
The 'Race of the South'
itself had a depleted number
of starters due to the s i c k e n -
ing acident on
ing accident on Paddock
Bend the previous day. P h i l
Read and Dave Croxford
were non-starters to name
just two. However, the new
Norton Challenge did make
an appearance piloted by
Scotsman A:ex George
although it expired halfway
through the race in a cloud
of steam.
' The race was eventually
won by John Williams from
John Newbold and Percy Tait
making it a 1—2-3 for the
Suzuki team.
Apart from not wanting to
descredit the works teams,
our racing machine was not
ready in time to enter.
However, it w i l l be raced
next season on practice days
and at Bemsee C l u b meetings,
so any budding agostinis who
wants to try their hand at"
road racing come along to our
meetings on Wednesday
lunchtime above Stan's Bar in
Southside, at I.COpm and
find out more about u s .
