Halls of Residence
At the end of last term the Governing
Body decided that H a l l and House Rents
would be reviewed termly. The review for
the end of this term is now getting under
way, and I have been asked for the
students' v i e w s on several points. One
of the main ones is the standard of
cleaning in the H a l l s . The wage B i l l for
the H a l l s forms quite a high proportion of
the total outgoings. I have been asked
whether the students feel that the H a l l
rooms are cleaned too often and whether
it is necessary for students to have their
beds made for them every day.Many
students like to have their cleaner I
know, but it must be realised that the
cleaner costs each student in H a l l about
£3 per week. If we want to keep the
cleaning at its present level we must
realise that it has to be paid for. I would
appreciate any comments or suggestions
on this topic.
Postgraduates
The college h a s set up a working
party, under the chairmanship of Prof
Pearson, Chem E n g , to investigate
Postgraduate Education at IC including
arrangements made for P G s in both the
academic and s o c i a l context. I was asked
to nominate three P G s to sit on the
working party, and I am s t i l l at the time
of writing looking for a girl on an Msc
course in R C S or Mines to attend. If
anyone would tike to, please come and
have a chat with me about it (Phone
Internal 2488).
Anyone can make submissions to the
working party, so if you would like to
comment on any facet of your P G Education,
now is the time to do it.
Refectories
I was most interested in the article
on Refectories by Mike Williams in the
last issue of F E L I X . Perhaps he w i l l
excuse this " s m u g c y n i c " for pointing
out the d i f f i c u l t i e s . F i r s t , I do not want to
see the refectories c l o s e d , or the prices
increased at C h r i s t m a s , however, I feel
that students should be deciding whether
the food in the refectories is good value
for money. If they feel it is not then of
course they should eat elsewhere.
Secondly, the main point around which
M i k e ' s solution revolves i s an improve-
ment in the q u a l i t y . I agree that the
quality should be improved and I have
said that if this were done I feel more
people would use the refectories. Mike
omitted an essential first step in his
arguement however, that i s ; Mr Mooney
must admit that the quality of food
leaves room for improvement. T h i s he
resolutely refuses to do, saying for
example, "A good chip to one person is
not necessarily a good chip to another."
The End
I look forward to some reaction from
this a r t i c l e . Keep s m i l i n g , and have a
good Rag Week.

Arising
'Mutters' takes to the air once more.
Consistent with tradition, it seems, this
epistle bears tidings of e l e c t i o n s .
Thankfully, some have taken place.
Hopefully, the others w i l l do.
Anyway, the following people have,
for thier sins, been elected as Union
Officers: External Affairs, Derek Everett,
P h y s i c s 2; Student Residence Officer,
Dave Rawnsley, P h y s i c s 2; Welfare
Officer, Sue K a l i c i n s k i , Chem E n g P G
and I C A G chairman, Ian Jowett, P h y s i c s 3,
Now we come to the meaty bit. Today,

or Derek Everett.
T h a t ' s it for now; have a good Raq

Refectory
battle w o n
T H E Q U E E N E L I Z A B E T H
College Students' Union has
won the latest round in its
refectory battle with the
C o l l e g e ' s administration.
P r i c e s in their refectory have
been lowered after a month of
student p r e s s u r e and
campaign which included the
setting-up of an alternative
refectory by the U n i o n .
The d e c i s i o n to set-up
an alternative refectory was
taken at the first U G M when
the Union found that p r i c e s
had been increased by an
average of 70% without their
being consulted.
Since then, the refectory
had been making a £600 l o s s
every week.
The U n i o n ' s self-catering
was carried out, with equipment
hired, in the gymnasium and
provided up to 300 meals a
day. The average cost of a
main course was i n the
region of 25p as opposed to
46p in the C o l l e g e ' s refectory.
The U n i o n ' s president, Mr
Wayne Philpott says that
they have broken even over
the period (month of October)
in which the system was
running.
A report by Mr Philpott on
the refectory set-up at Q E C
was circulated to a l l the
professors and members of
the Union C o u n c i l . A s a
result the College decided to
lower prices — a 46p main
course now costs 32p. The
number of people using the
refectory has risen dramatically
and it i s on this factor that
the Q E C Union i s resting i t s
case. It is hoped that the
increased turnover w i l l keep
losses to well below the
£600 mark. Mr philpott i s
satisfied with the way the
problem has been resolved,
"I'm pleased to see that the
College has given up trying
to break even on the refectory
and I hope this sets a trend tor
the future", he said.
Government s t a t i s t i c s would
put this element at £420 for
London.

D e a t h traps
Nearly 10,000 students i n
the city of L e e d s are l i v i n g
in houses which are potential
death traps — so reports
' L e e d s Student' — the L e e d s
U n i v e r s i t y newspaper. T h e
houses p o s s e s s little or no
fire fighting equipment and
many do not have planning
permission to be used as
multi-occupancy dwellings.
However, if strict safety
regulations were to be
enforced, there would be
drastic cuts in the accommod-
ation available for students.
