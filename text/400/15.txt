Magma - Magma Live (RCA, Utopia)
Wljh the release of this double-
album Magma prove c o n c l u s i v e l y that
together with C a n and Weather Report,
"they are amongst the formost musical
innovators working in the ever-widening
context of rock.
The seamlngly perpetually changing
line-up of the French band led by
virtuoso drummer, C h r i s t i a n Vander, for
this record c o n s i s t s of two keyboard
players, bass, guitar, v i o l i n and two
v o c a l i s t s , one of which is Vanders'
wife, S t e l l a , and its with the v i o l i n and
saprano v o i c e recently added to the
band where Magma succeed in making
perhaps their finest recorded work to d a t a
Listening to this record, I'm of the
opinion that the band seem to achieve
the sort of musical ecstacy that some-
how always seemed to elude,for instance,
the late lamented K i n g C r i m s o n .
Comparisons can be made throughout
this album with C r i m s o n ' s ' L a r k s
Tongues In A s p i c ' , each reaching a
musical climax after humble origins.
But where as K C ' s climax was derived
from purely sexual inspiration, Magma
achieve an ethereal majesty in their
music, quite unlike any band playing
today.
The first album Is taken up with
'Kohntark', a sombre, all-powerful
piece conjuring up v i s i o n s of some
macabre initiation ceremony, at times
close to Wagnerian construction a s
regards the use of the two voices.
The second record opens up with the
most e a s i l y a c c e s s i b l e song 'Kobah'
which is really a piece of complex
funk, Vander on percussion showing
his acute sense of space. T h i s is
followed by the beautifully melodic
'Lihns', which i s a feature for the
fine strong v o ;
c e of K l a u s B i a s q u i z .
The side ends with 'Hhai', which could
almost be Zapparesque in. origin, taken
at a breakneck three-eight pace, its
not too d i s i m i l a r to U n c l e F r a n k ' s
legendry ' K i n g k o n g ' .
For me Magma reach their musical
peak with the final cut, which takes up
the whole of side four. T h e ' piece
entitled 'Mekanik Zain', demonstrates
a l l the power and the glory that is.
Magma's music, the v i o l i n and guitar
soaring above the amazing driving
complexities of the rhythm section. I
don't think I've ever heard anything
played with such conviction in rock
music.
Throughout the album the* m u s i c i a n -
ship is little short of brilliant, Vander
in particular showing why he is regarded
as possibly the finest drummer to come
out of Europe. Anyone interested in the
advance of contemporary rock music
should at least give this album a l i s t e n .
John Denver - Windsong (RCA)
If I were the achetypal ' A l l American
boy', bred on molasses and too much
mothersmilk, believed that the world
was a beautiful place full of beautiful
people and C a l i f o r n i a was the promised
land — but above a l l appreciated
musical diarrhoea, I'd probably like
John Denver. A s fate would have it,
I was born a Welshman, live in one o f the
most violent c i t i e s in the Western world,
have been ripped-off by numerous
penny-thieving bastards and due to
rising inflation cannot afford to suffer
from any form of acute musical flatulence,
and I d i s l i k e John Denver.

'Pilgrim and 'A Little Black Magic' at
the Roundhouse, Chalk Farm.
Pilgrim is quasi-rock musical version
of C h r i s t i a n ' s journey from the C i t y of
Destruction to the C e l e s t i a l C i t y . It is
based of John Bunyan's tale from
P i Igrims Progress.
Paul Jones stars a s C h r i s t i a n in a
musical which threatened to stifle
itself in the first act by s t i c k i n g too
rigidly to the original story line.However,
it is rescued from this by a very s o l i d
and just short of powerful" performance
by Paul Jones who sings with gusto
and fervour.
He is ably supported by Peter
Straker as A p o l l y o n , P a u l N i c h o l a s
as Talleative and Joanna C a r l i n as
C h r i s t i a n ' s wife. The vocal talent o l
these three backed with that of the
rest of the company makes the musical
really come alive.
Throughout, there i s -
c o h e s i o n and
team work which is characteristic of
a Prospect Theatre production.Imaginative
costumes for A p o l l y o n (Peter Straker
nearly steals the show in this role as
he careers from one vocal limit to
another) and thoughtful use of the
limited stage also add to the whole
show.
Tomorrow is the last night of this
musical and if you are not already
engaged I would recommend this show
to y o u . Y o u jean get to the Roundhouse
quite e a s i l y bv tube (Chalk Farm) and
students receive a 30p discount on a l l
seats except those at 70p.
If after this, you feel like more
entertainment, then you c a n wait the
half hour or so to see Peter Straker
in a one-man cabaret show, A Little
Black Magic. T h i s also finishes tomorrow
night.
After h i s somewhat exhausting
performance in Pilgrim as A p o l l y o n
he manages to be completely refreshing
and exciting in a ninety-minute show
that swings from the almost false
gaity of the thirties to the bleak
seventies.
H i s depth and range of vocals has
not been heard this side of the A t l a n t i c
s i n c e Shirley B a s s e y last v i s i t e d these
damp i s l e s . Straker is such a talented
artist and performs with wit, style and
intelligence that a l l I can say is just
don't s i i reading this, go and see it
n o w ! ' Y o u might even be lucky and get
a Brack Magic chocolate — after a l l ,
that is what the admission fee pays for!

The Royal Shakespeare Company in
"Too True To Be Good", by George
Bernard Shaw, at the Aldwych Theatre.
One of the difficulties of Shaw's
plays is that one is never certain how
far they w i l l go before the plot breaks
down and the torrents of i d e a l i s t i c
reflection begin to flow. In "Too True to
be Good" we are well into the second
act before he gets down to the real heart
of the matter, and from there to the end
of the third act it is pretty tough going.
There is enough variation to keep the
correspondence columns of "The Times"
busy for months — war, medicine, women,
religion and the discovery that immense
riches do not lead to immense happiness.
For sheer theatrical effectiveness
the production deserves full marks. Ian
M c K e l l e n , a s the clergyman ex-airman
turned burglar w i t h , a penchant for
sermonising, holds the audience s p e l l -
bound. Ralph K o l t a i ' s sets are a ' b i t
overpowering, particularly for the third
act which takes place at the foot of a
cliff supposedly hewn out to some
semblance of St P a u l ' s , though which
resembled nothing so much as a piece of
distorted perspex.
Ken Wynne opens the play a s a
disconsolate microbe convinced that the
young lady, lying in her sick-bed, is
responsible for h i s having the German
measles. It is parts like that, and that of
Private Meek, who turns out to have had
more experience of army life than we
suspected, that make this play worthwhile,
if you find the rhetoric hard to take.
Judi Dench and Anna Calder-MarshalI
play the chambermaid turned nurse and
the respectable young lady who, together
with Mr M c K e l l e n , set out to enjoy
themselves with the proceeds of the s a l e
of a valuable n e c k l a c e . They finally
arrive, disguised as Countess V a l b r i o n i ,
her maid and h e r brother, at a secluded
desert beach where the B r i t i s h Army is in
the act of subduing brigands, whom they
believe to be holding the young lady
kidnapped. F u n is had with Meek,
apparently modelled on Aircraftsman
Shaw (or Lawrence of Arabia), who
w i e l d s more power than the colonel
whose sole interest is in watercolouring,
the only occupation of the B r i t i s h admired
by the Union of Federated Sensible
Societies. F i n a l l y the play arrives at the
bottom of the c l i f f s , where the clergyman's
father appears from nowhere. He i s an
atheist and h i s voice is amplified from
the back of the auditorium to confuse the
audience s t i l l further. The cast depart
to their preordained fates w h i l s t the
preacher declaims from h i s makeshift
pulpit until he is enveloped in fog and
his v o i c e is lost.
If the plot is weak then it is because
Shaw w a s more interested in using h i s
play as a vehicle for polemics. T h e
performance is strong and is w e l l worth
seeing. The play is on at the A l d w y c h
untii the end of this month, and students
can t a k e any seat in the'house a v a i l a b l e
half-an-hour before the performance for
70p.
