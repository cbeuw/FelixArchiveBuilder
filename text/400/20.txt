Imperial
The renaissance of Athletics at Imperial College took
place on Sunday 26th October at the West London Stadium.
SIT the gloomy shadow of Wormwood Scrubs prison approxi-
mately 30 enthusiastic athletes competed in seventeen
field and track events for ten silver trophies unearthed
from,deep recesses and glittering for the occasion.
Enthusiasm and a Willing-
FILIX
ness to try anything once were
the order rather than outstand -
ing individual b r i l l i a n c e . Dave
Lord — something to do with
C i t y and G u i l d s — should be
mentioned in the former
category and Ian E l l j s , S
Golding and Dave West in the
latter. Judges and time-keepers
were recruited from the
spectators who included g i r l - .
friends, children and a rather
unsavoury tramp and h i s d o g .
Due to a lack of competitors
the heats were abandoned and
only finals were run. T h e
athletic highlight of the
afternoon w a s undoubtedly the
1500 metres which developed
into a battle between Ian
E l l i s and Paul C l a r k e . Until
the last 200 metres Clarke w a s
leading by fifteen feet,
however E l l i s showed h i s
superior stamina and power
and overtook on the final bend
to w i n a well calculated and
timed race at a creditably
fast pace.
The water jump in the 3000
metres steeplechase w a s awe
inspiring. Rain had filled it to
the brim and extended its
length, the colour of the water
was an evil murky green and its
depth w a s indeterminate. T w o
of spray. T h e race w a s won
v e r y s e r l o . u s l y a n d
professionally by Ian E l l i s .
The tug-of-war w a s won by
C i t y and G u i l d s . After the
serious first round between
two 8-man teams from C & G and
R C S t h e s e c o n d r o u n d
degenerated into a free for a l l
with girl friends and children
helping both sides. Apart
from these odd lapses the
competition w a s very serious
and the novelty of running on a
Tartan track w a s enjoyed by
all the athletes.
The trophies were awarded
by John Thornback, Chairman
of A C C , Congratulations are
due to Steve Webb and Ian
E l l i s for their excellent
organisation, to Karen Ryder
for keeping the score, to Mrs
Dave West for time-keeping and
to Barbara Donnelly for her
v o c a l s .
There are no more athletic
events connected with the
College until the University of
London Championships early
in May. It is hoped that many
people who competed on
Saturday w i l l also take part
in this (IC won last year and
hope to retain it this year).
distinct methods of navigating
the jump were u t i l i s e d . T h e
first w a s the professional
method, as seen at the Olympics,
where the runner puts one foot
onto the jump then leaps
gracefully to land at the edge
of the shallows with a gentle
s p l a s h . T h e second and most
common method — a s used by
Pad Donnel ly — w a s to c lamber
onto the bar using both hands
and feet, to gain their balance,
grin anthropoldally then crouch
as though building up immense
power for take-off. T h e
resulting epitomy of athletic
prowess would then jump
half-heartedly, stumble on
Impact and fall in two feet of
f reez ing water sendI ng up sheets
There i s also a very active
C r o s s Country C l u b at IC and
anyone wanting to keep fit
during the winter Is strongly
encouraged to join (they also
d o some road runningand re lays;
it's not a l l slogging through
mifdl). Fixtures are advertised
on their notice board just
outside the union cloakroom.
Some members of the C l u b
a l s o take part in Open A t h l e t i c
meetings throughout the
winter and hope to enter some
Indoor races this season.
D e t a i l s of these events w i l l
be posted on their notice board
or anyone interested should
