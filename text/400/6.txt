they request removal from the drivers list, w h i c h may be
forfeited on damage occuring to the vehicle during u s e .
Appeals may be made against removal from the drivers
list and/or loss of deposit to the R C C Transport
sub-committee, whose d e c i s i o n s h a l l be f i n a l .
(The deposit i s held against-the £25.00 e x c e s s on the

the case of c l u b s and s o c i e t i e s by the relevant committee
