E l i m i n a t e fornication
Sir, — May I add my comment
as a C h r i s t i a n , to the
abortion debate. A s far a s I
know, the B i b l e does not
mention abortion but It does
have something to s a y about
fornication which is the
cause of most of the problem.
God d i d not make rules to
irritate and restrict us but
because he knows what is
good for us (he w a s our
designer) and those who
Ignore the rules w i l l tend to
suffer and so w i l l the
society in which they live.
So, eliminate fornication and
the abortion issue w i l l
largely disappear a s a
fringe benefit.
To those who do not
believe in God I would a s k
them to consider the communist
rulers of this world. Neither
do they believe in G o d but
they are well aware of the
dangers of sexual immorality
and have made great progress
in stamping it o u t .
Yours faithfully,

Sir, - In reply to Mr F i t z -

with the problems of c o n -

pregnancy. I am sure that a
Refectory prices
Sir - IWith reference to the
letter from Anon, concerning
refectory prices published in
F E L I X N o . 399, may I point
out that the writer h a d h i s facts
completely wrong. He claimed
to have been under-charged
to the value of 9p; whereas he
was actually charged correctly.
The price indicated on the
menu (in this case 35p for cod)
includes chips or potatoes and
a vegetable. If one does not
have chips/potatoes or a
vegetable, then their price is
subtracted from the c o s t . Thus
the marked price i s for a
complete main course, and not
just for the meat/fish as the
writer of the letter, believes.
Regarding the refectory
debate, may I state my whole
hearted agreement with the
article by Mike Williams (also
in F E L I X no. 399).

"Refectories'1
:
M r W i l l i a m s ' ideas ill-conceived
Sir, — I enjoy a sharp sensational article, but I make no apologies
for the following which is a repudiation of last week's article on
, " R e f e c t o r i e s " by M ike W i l l i a m s .
That.was tbe one that began by suggesting that Mr Teague and
Mr Mooney should have their heads banged together (good stuff,
that!), be forced to trust each other (no harm in that) and hence
solve the refectory economic c r i s i s at a stroke. Mr Mooney would
raise the quality of h i s food, and Mr Teague would implore more
students to eat there.
The article is ill-conceived on several accounts; in particular
(a) it is improbable and factually incorrect; (b) it is of doubtful
idealogical b a s i s .
Taking the points in their logical order — Mr Teague and
Mr Mooney are only two comparatively minor people who influence
the refectory price l i s t s . The most important people are undoubt-
edly.the Rector and h i s F i n a n c i a l Secretary who must take any
proposed increases to the Governing Body (for rubber-stamping?)
Mr league put the basic idea Mr Williams was suggesting to
these people last summer!! (which lets Pete off the hook and
that leaves Mr Mooney banging h i s head together by himself).
Mr Teague argued that a 40% increase would stop people eating
in the refectories. A 20% (say) increase would s t i l l mean a loss,
but not the devastation a large increase would bring.
They replied that even if Mr Mooney could be persuaded
to make a much smaller increase, and raise h i s standard of
preparation (which he i n s i s t s is already as high as one c a n
expect from refectory catering), they could not endorse such
a suggestion, because they are bound by U G C rules to balance
their accounts. Should they f a i l , and appear not to have done
their utmost, then I believe that the U G C have a specialty
prepared ton of bricks which they would lower rapidly onto the
Rector's head.
Why would the U G C be unlikely to think that they had not
tried their hardest if they implemented Mr W i l l i a m s ' s scheme?
I cannot read their minds, but some simple mathematics suggests
that if the price rise had been limited to 20°h, then at least 3 0 %
• more students would have to eat there compared with last year
to break even on the year!! Secondly I do not totally preclude
the idea that we should be prepared to help ourselves by helping
the refectories, but I cannot accept the extent to which Mr
Williams carries it.
Quite apart from whether his idea could work, the idealogical
basis of Mr W i l l i a m s ' s suggestion is of a debatable nature. It
seems to me that the refectories should be c l a s s e d as a service,
and the service is for them to supply food to students and
staff. We are not here to supply the refectory with a service —
namely customers, w h i c h is what Mr Williams is suggesting
if his idea is carried to its logical c o n c l u s i o n .
To apply an analogy, the students at this c o l l e g e are here
just to give the staff something to do!
I w i s h people would not write:-
" D o u b t l e s s the smug l i t t l e c y n i c s ... w i l l point out the
d i f f i c u l t i e s " when they ' r e a l l y ' mean that they want everyone to
g i v e this idea fair c o n s i d e r a t i o n " . If anyone reading this feels
that it is full of smug c y n i c i s m , s o be it; but I would-rather I
did not feel prejudged.
Another point follows on from this: it is obvious from the
article that Mr Williams had never suggested this idea to the
president or even bothered to check facts with anyone
example, the chairman of the Refectory Committee.
Why not?
Y o u r s faithfully,

F E L I X has now been reporting, recording and enter-
taining Imperial C o l l e g e for nearly twenty-six years. Since
its birth it has undergone rapid and sometimes severe
change, not least being the change from letter-press to
off-set litho — a very painful transformation but nevertheless
o<roe w h i c h has revitalised the paper and interest in it.
The very first issue, under the Editorship of E M Hughes
consisted of thirteen pages (plus a front cover) of Roneo'd
full-scap, of which 600 copies were printed. They sold out
by 10.00am! Y e s , they were sold in those days for the
sum of 3 d . I hope that this issue, despite being free , w i l l
a l s o go by the same time.
In that first i s s u e , the editor announced:
"The need has been felt tor some time for a frequently
published journal to comment upon the affairs of the College
whilst they are still topical, and to bring to the attention
of its members the activities of clubs and societies of
which people at present know little, and knowing little,
tend to care even less...
"The success or failure of this paper depends principally
upon you, our readers. In the first place we depend upon
you to produce many ot our articles and reports, since our
staff cannot themselves attend and report every College
event. Secondly we depend upon you to maintain a lively
correspondence in our columns".
Both the sentiments echoed in the above extract s t i l l
hold good today and more so than ever. Through the pages
of F E L I X you make your ideas, opinions and grievances
known to the whole C o l l e g e , be challenged and challenge
on these and other peoples ideas, opinions e t c .
I hope you enjoy reading this issue. Have a good Rag
Week and don't forget to pass on a l l the juicy tales of who
did what where.
