Engineering is fashionable
A few years ago, it suddenly (over a period of five years or so)
dawned upon the B r i t i s h Government that the country w a s being
left behind in the technology field, even by countries not c l a s s i f i e d
as Top N a t i o n s . T h e most obvious example of this w a s J a p a n ,
which seemed to be producing a technological heritage over the
decades s i n c e 1945 equal to and greater than ours of 200 years.
Determined to do something
about this sorry state of affairs,
they decided to send somebody
out to Japan to see How They
Did It. K i n d l y , and for no
p a r t i c u l a r r e a s o n . T h e
Goldsmiths' Institute agreed
to finance this expedition. T h e
man they sent (this reads like
James Bond, doesn't It?) w a s
Dr G C Sneed, a n engineer
working in the Science
Museum, who lectured to u s
this evening.
T h i s Intrepid traveller
spent a couple of months in
Japan, going round the various
types of schoolsanduniversities,
asking thousands of questions
(through a translator) and
taking 2000 photographs. He
covered every facet of Japanese
life, trying to explain why
Japan had s o many competent
engineers. F i r s t l y he looked
at the various primary and
secondary s c h o o l s . Perhaps
superb s c i e n c e f a c i l i t i e s
encouraged wou Id-be engi neers?
Not a chance. Standard l a b .
f a c i l i t i e s were c h a i r s , tables
and blackboards. P o s s i b l y ,
there might be a balance
somewhere, or some test tubes,
but the students much prefered
lapping up theory. But why?
In Japan, there are two
types of university, state
owned and privately owned.
These privately owned
establishments are second
grade places that are run a s
businesses, and do not figure
in the Great Technology D r i v e s .
The state universities take the
cream, and after the four year
course, the selection procedure
is very simple: T h e best
people go to the best firms.
None of this democracy of
interviewing everybody who
wants to b e . T h i s appears to
be the root cause. B e c a u s e it
is obvious who the best people
are, and because these are s o
well-paid, it is a matter of
prestige of who can make the
grade to become one of t h e e l i t e ,
who own the second homes, the
big cars and the b i g yachts.
So everyone i s struggling to
make it themselves, or egging
their children on to become one
or marry one. It's simple
Digging up Jerusalem
The meeting on 3rd
November was rather a s p e c i a l
occasion, being the first time
that a woman had delivered a
talk to the society. Dame
Kathleen Kenyon, archelogist
of great repute, spoke on
"Digging up Jerusalem" - a
task which s h e undertook in
the s i x t i e s . Ancient P a l e s t i n e
had always been somewhat
overshadowed both p o l i t i c a l l y
and a r t i s t i c a l l y by neighbours
like Egypt and h a s thus
received relatively little
attention from archeologists.
Those who have studied it
have been rewarded not s o
much by splendid finds — the
best a r t i c l e s that Dame
Kathleen found being a pair
of battered bronze buckets —
as by the satisfaction of
filling a gap in human
knowledge.
L i t t l e remains of the early
c i t i e s that stood on the site
and thus the talk w a s largely
devoted to tracing the move-
ments of their w a l l s from the
economics. In Japan, engineer-
ing i s fashionable, and no
longer do some of the best
brains do arts subjects and go
straight into the c i v i l service.
It doesn't pay s o w e l l .
So the B r i t i s h Government
now knows what to d o . Well,
Mr Healey, How about cuttting
engineers' income t a x , for
starters...?
