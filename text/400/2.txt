After a fairly hectic five weeks
at IC,Stella Godfrey, ICWA president,
outlines future ICWA programmes
and how to get the best out of ICWA
socially and otherwise.
The last of the F r e s h e r s ' Dinners
being over, there is just a momentary
pause in which to catch our breaths
before being plunged into Rag Week.
Indeed, when this article goes to
P r e s s , Rag Week w i l l have already
begun with ICWA's own " 2 0 ' s R e v i v a l
P a r t y ' . In addition to t h i s , Rag Week
w i l l contain a whole host of weird
and wonderful events, so get involved
and make it the s u c c e s s it deserves
to be.
The next event on the ICWA calendar
after the " 2 0 ' s Party' w i l l be a debate
on Tuesday, 18th November at 7.00pm
in the ICWA lounge. The riotian w i l l
be 'This house believes that women
who are raped ask tor it', in response
to an article by J a c k Gratus which
recently appeared in 'Over 2 1 ' magazine.
Mr Gratus, author of ' T h e V i c t i m ' ,
w i l l be defending the riotion and
Margaret A l l e n , features editor of ' T h e
Times' ' w i l l oppose if. (Margaret A l t e n ,
you w i l l remember came to college last
year to speak to the 'Women in Science
and Technology' Group on the subject
of 'Women in Industry'.) We a l s o require
two further speakers (one defending,
one opposing) from C o l l e g e , so if you
would l i k e to air your views on the
subject at the debate, drop a note
into my letter-rack in the Union Office.
Sherry will be provided.
On Thursday, 20th November at
12.30pm, the first ICWA General
Meeting of the s e s s i o n w i l l take place.
During the meeting, the committee
w i l l report to you on its a c t i v i t i e s
to date and events planned for the
future. It is important that all members
attend so that we know we are spending
your money as you would like to see
it spent. That is, think of it as a share
holders meeting! Further, the F r e s h e r ' s
representative for this s e s s i o n w i l l
be elected at this meeting. The post
w i l l be best f i l l e d by someone prepared
to express her opinions on the present
running of ICWA and a l s o contribute
some new ideas. The nomination
papers are on the Union notice board
outside the Union Office. On the ICWA
committee there is a l s o a post for one
male and we would l i k e any men in
college who thinks he can contribute
to the running of ICWA to stand for
the post. He w i l l need an ICWA nlember
to propose him, the nomination papers
being posted on the Union notice
board.
On the evening of the 20th November,
ICWA w i l l be holding a Post Graduate
and Overseas students s o c i a l evening.
The aim of the evening w i l l be to get to
know some of the more e l u s i v e members
of c o l l e g e and to d i s c u s s what they
would like to see us organising on
their behalf, together with any points
they may have raised during the General
Meeting. So if *y.ou are either a post-
graduate or an Overseas Student,
whether first year or t h i r d year, please
attend. There w i l l be no charge and the
s o c i a l w i l l take place in the ICWA
lounge, which for those of you who have
not found it as yet, is next to the
Union Office on the first floor of the
Union B u i l d i n g . It w i l l begin at 6.30pm.
The Wednesday lunch time meetings
of the 'Women in S c i e n c e and Technology"
group w i l l continue as usual and as a
future event to note, Professor Daphne
J a c k s o n , Professor of P h y s i c s at
Surry, w i l l be coming to speak to the
group on December 4th. Watch t h i s
space for further details on that.
For those people who are not aware
of t h i s , there are magazines provided
in the lounge. These include ' P u n c h ' ,
' T i m e ' a n d 'New S c i e n t i s t ' . We a l s o
hope to be able to provide coffee
f a c i l i t i e s , . s h o r t l y .
F i n a l l y , make the most of Rag
Week and see you at the Debate on
the 18th.
Stella Godfrey
