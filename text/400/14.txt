Burlesque
BURLESQUE - exciting
If taken in the right c o n t e x t
Burlesque's concert for the J a z z C l u b
on Sunday 26th October was probably the
most exciting and enjoyable musical
performance witnessed at IC this term.
From their first number "Gorilla Crunch"
it was obvious that Burlesque were a
band with a certain difference. Their
music held its roots firmly in the same
ground as Frank Zappa and it was
refreshing to hear music of this kind
performed with so much conviction and
talent. It was impossible to fault them,
although I tried very hard. One by one
aach of the five musicians proved his
s k i l l . The lead guitarist played with
the energy o_ John M c L a u g h l i n , contin-
ually turning out rifs of such complexity
it was hard to believe that they were a
band without a following of m i l l i o n s
yet alone a record contract.
Although it was obvious they were
strongly influenced by Zappa they only
played one number composed by him. In
this the drummer who beforehand had
remained anonymous,
by his drum kit, produced a solo which
even B i l l y Cobham himself would have
been proud of. The number was "Road
Ladies" from Chmfs\'.$. Revenge and
the band seemed to have a strong pre-
occupation with ladles of any kind
which added strong interest to the
lyrics of their songs.
The only disappointing part of the
evening was the small s i z e of the
audience. If J a z z C l u b had arranged for
the bar to be open some of_ the 200
inhabitants of the Union bar at this time
could have enjoyed this musical feast.
Burlesque obviously had a strong effect
on most people there and John Downs
was heard to say that they w e r e
"Cosmic Man". Well even if they were,
they were a l s o the most enjoyable
band to be seen so far this year, and a l l
for free.
A l l is not lost If you missed this
concert for Burlesque are playing support
to George Melly on 22nd November In the
Great H a l l . G o along and witness what
promises to be the most entertaining
concert at IC this year.
Magma at the New Victoria Theatre
Magma came, saw and deafened a
meagre audience on the oocassion of
their only British concert date prior
to a European and American tour.
However, do not despair, they are
coming back early next year for a
concert tour.
Magma are a French group, one of
the early underground progressives,
who have now won wide a c c l a i m in
France and Europe but have a s yet to
break through in this country. They
have released two or three albums the
latest of which Magma L i v e , is reviewed
in these pages.
They have a musical language of
their own and it is quite something to
see them performing on stage. Their
music is completely enveloping and
frighteningly raw and b a s i c . That is not
A new musical experience
say the music is not well played but
in fact so well executed that in its
final climax it threatens to tear one
and a l l asunder.
The musical inspiration of the
group comes from their drummer, C h r i s t i a n
Vander, who is at the focus of a l l
their music from writing to playing.
He gave one of the most nightmarish
drumming solos I have yet witnessed
to date and yet delivered it with a total
sincerity and dedication that almost
catches one unawa res.
At the climax of their performance
one gets the feeling, perhaps due to the
primeval nature of the music and its
language, kobaian, that one is watching
a kind of satanic rite with the group
totally involved and unaware of their
audience to the point where it would
seem that they were superfluous. They
built up to such a violent crescendo
that the New V i c t o r i a Theatre reverberated
quite considerably.
And yet, they play with finesse
combining percussion with v o c a l s ,
with electronic chorus and making use
of v i o l i n in place of lead guitar to
produce a sound that leaps at you with
force. The bass player is unforgetable
in his style and almost frenzied playing
of his instrument — it is a small miracle
his fingers do not get caught in the
strings.
For a new musical experience I
would suggest you go and s e e them
when they next v i s i t Britain or content
yourself with their latest album, Magma
L i v e , which goes some way to capturing
the way they play on stage.

BARCLAY JAMES HARVEST - Time
Honoured Ghosts (Polydor):
T h i s is the latest album from a band
who have been doing the rounds for a
long time now, and built up quite a
following in the process. They are a l l
competent m u s i c i a n s , yet lack the
inventive and innovative talents that
elevate groups above 2nd d i v i s i o n status.
Attempting to bring together s t y l e s
originated by other a r t i s t s , they think
that by using the best moments from said
pieces and combining them, a worthwhile
end-product w i l l be found. It doesn't work
and only results in B J H having no
particular 'sound' of their own.
"In my life" is the best song on the
album — a ' y e s ' - sty led composition
with tasteful, flowing guitar work from
John L e e s . " S w e e f Jesus" sounds too
much like a dirge but nevertheless
contains another good L e e s s o l o . Of
interest is a track c a l l e d 'Titles', whose
lyrics are made up completely from the
names of old B e a t l e s ' standards. The
rest of the album is consistent if
unexciting and the tracks are not worth
mentioning i n d i v i d u a l l y . Suffice to say
that L e e s , Holroyd, Wolstenholme do
their job as best they can yet the songs
do not reach the standard of the playing.
It's not an album to make unconverted
listeners interested in the band, either
live or recorded, but it has a certain hazy
pastoral charm — s o l i d l y - d e p e n d a b l e
' E n g l i s h ' music which doesn't expect you
to listen too hard and contains few
surprises. There's a nice cover job done
by B i l l Dare (take a bow) oozing with a
warm countryside atmosphere — many
oranges and glowing reds which complement
the music contained — the type of cover
that would stand out if you were browsing
through a record r a c k .
A s with so many releases, if you don't
expect too much this record w i l l satisfy,
but records nowadays, are so pricy that
the buying public probably looks for
something s p e c i a l rather than an ordinary
L P . B J H fans wont be disappointed.
