The Unflappable Diplomat
Profile - Mickey Davies C M G Q B E M A
A s Secretay of Imperial College, Michael John ( M i c k e y to
his friends) Davies is the head of the C o l l e g e ' s administration,
being responsible to the Rector. The friendly epitome of
unflappable diplomacy, he possesse s a finely honed razor of a
mind, a disarming fluency of ideas and perhaps the driest
sense of humour in IC. He arrived here in 1962 when there were
around 2,700 students studying (there are now over 4,000)
and just as the Southside halls were being finished, having
completed an astonishingly impressive career in HM'Government's
C o l o n i a l (later c a l l e d Overseas) Service in what was then
Tanganyika.
Born at Cape Town, South
Africa of British parents in
1918, Mickey was educated
there and studied for one
year at Cape Town University
before winning a Rhodes
scholarship to Oxford where
he spent the next two years.
It was during this period, he
recalls wistfully, that he was
capped twice for Wales at
Rugby Union and yet did not
get a 'blue' for the sport â€”
" a n unusual but not unique
experience. I was very good
friends with the captain of
the Oxford team that year
which makes it a l l the more
i n t e r e s t i n g . " H i s eyes twinkle
mischievously and his wry
smile seems to echo the
sentiment.
Fresh down from Oxford In
1940, he entered the C o l o n i a l
Service as an Administrative
Officer and was sent to
Tanganyika which was then
under B r i t i s h Trusteeship.
After various jobs in the
field, two years secondment
to the C o l o n i a l Office here in
London ("What they used to
c a l l ' b e a c h c o m b i n g ' " he
smiled), and three-and-a-half
years as private secretary to
the Governor of Tangonyika,
heeventua I ly rose to ministerial
office in the colonial govern-
ment of the day, initially In
the Ministry of Security and
Immigration, being responsible
for the police, the prison
service and defence during
an unsettled period in A f r i c a ' s
history when the growing
feeling of nationalism was
prevalent. "It was the first
faltering steps towards the
country's independence and
we had a ministerial form of
government as opposed to a
c i v i l service k i n d . "
" T h e s e were not easy
times with African nationalism
on the march. One was doing
a job which was in effect to
do oneself out of a job. T h i s
did cause problems for some,
but I personally found it
easier because I believed in
what the ultimate goal for
Tanganyika was: independence.
I went out there with a lot of
idealism and I do not think I
ever lost any. "I got to know
very w e l l J u l i u s Nyerere, who
is now the President of
T a n z a n i a and who was
Tanganyika's first Prime
Minister, when he was the
l e a d e r of t h e T a n g a n -
y i k a A f r i c a n N a t i o n a l
U n i o n . L a t e r we were
colleagues in the Council of
Ministers under the Governors
so I had the unusual experience
of knowing J u l i u s Nyerere on
'both sides of the fence as it
w e r e . "
It was in 1960 when the
governor's right-hand man, the
Chief Secretary, was away for
four months between May and
August that Mickey as the then
Minister for Information was
appointed A c t i n g Chief
Secretary. The transfer of
power in the neighboring
Belgian Congo was not going
peacefully during this period
and thousands of Belgian
nationals were fleeing across
L a k e Tanganyika to Tanganyika
itself to seek refuge. It fell
upon the A c t i n g Chief Secretary
to organise the reception of
thousands of refugees and this
was done by building camps
at utmost speed. For this he
was awarded the Media lie de
la Belgique Reconnaissante
by the Belgian government on
his return to Britain the
following year.
Returning to London In
April 1962 having completed
twenty-one years in the
C o l o n i a l Service, Mickey
applied for the vacant job of
Secretary of the Imperial
C o l l e g e . "I was interviewed
by a panel which included Sir
Patrick Linstead who was
then Rector of the C o l l e g e . "
He got the job.
A major preoccupation at
the time was the C o l l e g e ' s
redevelopment b u i l d i n g
program. It was IC's e s s e n t i a l l y
'bricks and mortar' period
with Sir Patrick Linstead as
the main driving force. The
Southside halls were just
being completed, the old
C i t y and G u i l d s building was
being pulled down, the
Sherfield Building was only
in the pipeline and Queen's
Tower was precariously
swaying in the w ind.
It was almost bizarre that
the end of this period happened
to coincide with the Rector's
death. Sir P a t r i c k Linstead
was succeeded by atomic
s c i e n t i s t Lord Penny in
1967.
" L o r d Penney's arrival
here coincided with a general
awakening of interest on the
part of the NUS and student
unions generally. It was
from that time forward that
students here took a greater
interest in College committees;
student observers came onto
the Governing Body during
that time. Throughout the
history of Imperial College,
each Rector has made his
own d i s t i n c t i v e contribution
to the C o l l e g e . "
Hmm, I thought. .Time for a
speculative probe I think. Do
you think that Sir Brian F lowers'
time as Rector will be
remembered as one during which
Imperial College began to
think about Europe? The
aplomb faltered not one iota.
The finely honed razor parried
the thrust elegantly. " I ' m not
really able to read the tea-
leaves on this one. I don't
think I would say more than
that his time as Rector w i l l
be regarded as s i g n i f i c a n t . "
Hmm, I thought. Time to
give u p .
