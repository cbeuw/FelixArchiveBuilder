R E C O R D REVIEWS
From the start, with the album s l e e v e
depicting the man on horseback, seeming-
ly riding from the depths of the ocean,
you get the idea of what Denver is a l l
about — the world of the escapist -
twee songs concerning polution and the
environment - music of the wind and
the rain. A s he puts it in h i s sleeve
note to h i s many followers — '/ wanted
to record the songs that the wind makes,
there is beautiful, beautiful music
there. All you have to do is listen. I
love you and I wish you peace'. In my
opinion the horse is facing the wrong
way.
The titles of the songs suggest, well
enough, what they are concerned with,
ranging from the country and western
feel of 'Love is Everywhere' (sic), the
e c o l o g i c a l 'Looking For Space', 'Fly
Away' (which includes our own O l i v i a
New'on Squirel singing vocal harmony)
with its ' l e t ' s get away from the hustle
of the city to the sands and the s e a '
fruitcake shmuck. There is even a
tribute to Captain Cousteau and h i s
crew of amiable sailors of the good
ship 'Calypso'. The arrangements
given to the songs are as bland as the
lyrics they ensconse.
Which with a l l things considered,
leaves 'Windsong' an undoubted s u c c e s s
with much of the record-buying public -
the album is already top of the American
Chart and fast rising in our own. But for
me, the only 'Windsong' this album
suggests, is the kind of anal disturbance
one gets from a baked bean overdose.

FOCUS - 'Mother Focus' (Polydor):
F o c u s have been laying rather low
these past few years after their sudden
rise to fame following the s i n g l e s - s u c c e s s
of "Hocus - Pocus", with a lengthy
post — " F o c u s 3 " s i l e n c e and the
unexceptional "Hamburger Concerts"
album. They haven't been over-enthusiastic
to return to the forefront of the music b i z ,
and, much in that vein, the new album
comes across as a s a t i s f i e d , restrained
effort from the number one Dutch group.
T h e y ' v e injected a little bit of 'funk'
into the style through bassist Bert
Ruiter's writing and playing.
"/ need a bathroom" resembles
B u d g i e s "Who do you want for your love"
from the new "Bandolier" album (that's a
plug) — and it sounds just funky — the
bass thudding away over the energetic
drumming that gives the track life.
"Bennie Helder" could e a s i l y have come
from their "Moving Waves" with i t ' s
c l a s s i c a l l y — oriented feel and easy
grace. The strength of this band is that
their songs s t i l l revolve around a strong
central melody with the embellishment
as extra, unlike s o much music these
days comprising solely of f r i l l s and no
substance, sometimes with e x c e s s i v e
s u c c e s s .
Atrocious as it seems, this is an easy-
listening album — not the Man to van i/James
Last brylcreem sludge greased onto
vinyl — more a smooth, refined approach
to producing low-volume music. T h e
band produces a ' f u l l ' sound - steady
unobtrusive rhythmic bass/drum collages
with the main theme gliding through on
synthesizer, organ, or guitar.
"Trdpic bird" is the most beautifully
fragile piece on the album — a soft, flow-
ing, French sound, ideal for the opening
or c l o s i n g moments of a film like
"Emmanuelle" - in short, pretty neat. It
might not get your rocks off but i t ' l l grab
the ladies.
T h i s is such an understated album that
it probably won't go far chartwise, but
that's just as well because it should
become one of those cherished, unknown
albums that finds itself a special place
in c o l l e c t i o n s . The racy guitar solos and
demented V a n Leer vocal noises have
mellowed out and the sharp edges have
been smoothed down but a compositional
strength has taken i t ' s place, although
two sides of this can't do for the c i r c u l a -
tion what one good Page riff or inspired
Santana solo are capable of. What this
album really needs are a couple of head
bustin-rockers where the musicians
allow themselves to let r i p .
Nevertheless, if modesty is a virtue,
F o c u s are in line for medals. They might
doze off in the middle of the next album,
though.

"Get Down" by Joe Simon (Polydor)
Once upon a time, a F E L I X editor
was given a record, by J o e Simon, to
review. T h i s record contained such
masterpieces as " G e t Down, Get Down
(Get On The Floor)", a n d , "It Be's That
Way Sometimes." Several seconds after
the afore-mentioned F E L I X editor had
lowered the needle onto the record, he
decided to be kind and pass the said
record on to somebody e l s e .
Eventually he found the right person —
he saw a corpse wearing a dirty old light
brown hat. T o this person he did give the
record.
The hat has two musical loves; a)
Kilbrun and the High Roads and b) the
A R P Oddessey synthesizer:he d i d , how-
ever find "It Be's That Way Sometimes",
extremely good - quite to h i s liking in
fact - he even did like the first few
seconds of "Fire Burning". The hat does
not, however, find that type of musical
extravagance called "Soul Muzik", to
his taste - and thus despite the fact that
all aspects of production — mixing,
playing of instruments etc — are very
well done, he does tend to turn green at
too much of it.
