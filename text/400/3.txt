The Future
The following is the major text of the speech delivered by Lord
Rothschild, on the occasion of becoming an Honorary Fellow and
Special Visitor of the Imperial College of Science and Technology.
T H E MOST important members of this
audience have only recently started
their adult lives and may therefore
wonder what the future holds in store
for them. S o , like many others before. I
thought I would have a shot at telling
y o u . I start with the difficulty that,
though I am pretty confident you w i l l
live longer than your fathers and mothers,
I don't know how long longer i s . But this
has the advantage for me of not having to
be too precise about dates — perhaps in
some c a s e s I s h a l l be out by a mere
matter of a thousand years or more.
Trying or pretending to foretell the
future has been a human failing s i n c e the
earliest times. But futurologist have not
always been too s u c c e s s f u l when peering
into the c r y s t a l b a l l . I n 1925, f
o r example,
Bertrand R u s s e l I pronounced that " p h y s i c a l
science is thus approaching the stage
when it w i l l be complete and therefore
u n i n t e r e s t i n g . " It would be a long job to
list the advances in physical science
s i n c e then. J B S Haldane, one of E n g l a n d ' s
brightest and most eccentric s c i e n t i s t s ,
wrote that he was satisfied from thermo-
dynamic c a l c u l a t i o n s that the energy
inside an atom could never be harnessed.
Similarly, Rutherford did not believe that
atom-splitting would ever be put to
practical use (or misuse for that matter).
So much for prophecies about nuclear
power and the H-bomb w h i c h , incidentally,
I predict w i l l not intentionally be used
in your lifetime, though there w i l l be
some troublesome moments. These
examples are sufficient to explain why I
approach my task with modesty and an
appropriate lack of confidence.
Colonization of outer space will not
solve world population explosion.
Many people, like Malthus in 1798, are
worried about the population explosion
and, unless the American s c i e n t i s t
C a l h o u n ' s experiemts on the reluctance
of rats to reproduce at the expected rate,
even when not crowded, have been
confirmed and c a n be extrapolated to
human beings, there are good reasons for
this worry. If we assume, only, of course,
for purposes of i l l u s t r a t i o n , that people
w i l l go on having babies at the present
rate, by the year, 3.700 the weight of a l l
the human beings on earth w i l l equal the
weight of the earth. Some 1.700 years
later, in the year 5.400, if everyone on
earth were to be put into a hollow b a l l ,
its radius would have to be 20.000 times
that of the earth and the ball would have
to expand at an alarming rate to keep up
with the constantly increasing number of
babies.
Some solution of the population
explosion i s , evidently, necessary; and
the need for a solution is one of the
reasons why writers about the future and
others like the distinguished s c i e n t i s t ,
J D Bernal, predict an exodus from earth
to other parts of the universe.
It surprises me that so many writers
about the future seem mesmerised by
outer space and by Professor Wheeler of
the Institute for Advanced Studies at
Princeton, in part of whose universe
time does not e x i s t , with a l l sorts of
Improbable a n d , in my view, impossible
consequences. But nearly a l l of these
writers, in spite, probably, of having
heard of C r i c k , Watson, D N A and R N A ,
fail to realise the equally or more fantastic
changes taking place now in the Life
Sciences a n d , with certainty, in the
future during your lifetime. Although I
shall have something to say about outer
space I shall a l s o dilate a little on what
you can expect in and from the living
world.
One can Implant electrodes into a
particular part of a rat's brain a n d , by
electrical stimulation, induce the
experience of intense pleasure. The rats
can be taughi to switch the electricity on
when they feel like it, and it turns out
that the pleasure is s o intense that when
the rats are presented with their equivalent
of caviare or Marilyn Monroe, they ignore
these stimuli and continue to press the
pleasure button. There seems little
doubt — and I think it has been confirmed
experimentally - that the same can be
done with human beings. In your lifetime
the crude method of e l e c t r i c a l stimulation,
which in any case would be inapplicable
on a large s c a l e , w i l l be replaced by its
chemical equivalent, in the form of a p i l l ,
E x t a s i n (a descendant Aldous H u x l e y ' s
Soma). I don't know what the chemical
w i l l be but I suspect it w i l l be something
like catecholamine (familiar to nerve
physiologists and some others) but more
complicated and therefore difficult to
manufacture i l l i c i t l y .
Anxiety about top civil servants
becoming too good humoured
and euphoric under the influence of
Extasin
What may some of the consequences of
E x t a s i n be? F o r reasons of economy and
modernity, s p e c i a l issues of E x t a s i n w i l l
replace the honours doled out to C i v i l
servants and some others on the Queen's
birthday and at other times of the year.
Some naive people might think that the
number of d a y s ' pleasure w i l l be pro-
portional to the level of the honour; one
day for an M , two for an O, three for a C ,
four for a K and five for a G . But that
w i l l not be the c a s e . We cannot afford to
give our most senior and distinguished
c i v i l servants four or five days of
unimitigated e c s t a s y , b e c a u s e v
of the
awesome problems they have to face
each day and w h i c h , in their ecstatic
condition, they might not take seriously
enough. Imagine the Secretary of the
Cabinet or the Permanent Head of the
Treasury having an overwhelming and,
possibly, euphoric sense of satisfaction
throughout one week. The concept is
untenable — inconceivable — s o the
quantitative aspects of this new form of
honour w i l l require the attention of an
Interdepartmental Committee or even,
perhaps, a Royal C o m m i s s i o n .
Shortly after the introduction of
E x t a s i n for this purpose, it w i l l be issued
free, to a strictly limited extent, on the
Health Service, every Saturday morning.
Cancellation of Saturday Extasin
ration replaces prison sentences.
The L a w Court computers may decide,
not only for public expenditure reasons,
that cancellation of E x t a s i n should
replace the present archaic system of
prison sentences. If one is used to
intense pleasure every weekend, it w i l l
By the year 3,700 the weight
of all the human beings on
earth will equal the weight of
the earth. The need for a
solution of the population
explosion is one of the reasons
why writers about the future
predict an exodus from earth
to other parts of the universe.
But how would we get there and
is it possible? Or do we go
back to the barely heard-of
Calhoun? Lord Rothschild
takes a look at the problem
of over-population.
b e a n intense punishment not to experience
it, quite apart from withdrawal symptoms.
Or w i l l the computers come to the
opposite c o n c l u s i o n and quintuple the
Health Service dose, on the basis that
people in a permanent good humour and in
a condition of intense pleasure w i l l
neither steal, rape nor mug again? Only
the computers w i l l t e l l .
There is also the p o s s i b i l i t y , though
it i s not a probability as in the case of
E x t a s i n , that intense misery p i l l s , c a l l e d
• Miserin, w i l l be developed and replace
prison sentences.
Used in war; or is Extasin better?
I am sure that one or both of these
substances w i l l be produced in your
lifetime and not only w i l l they be used
for the purposes already mentioned, but
a l s o in war, or the threat of it. What does
a commander do when his troops, pilots,
astronauts or s a i l o r s become depressed,
dejected and apathetic following a
surprise dispersal of Miserin originating
from a satellite? What might well happen
here in these circumstances is that gas
masks, though in existence, w i l l either
be in the wrong place or the rubber w i l l
have perished. Some Frenchman, perhaps
Talleyrand, s a i d , " W a r is much too
serious a thing to be left to military
m e n " . In your time war may w e l l have to
be left to the anti-chemists. So it w i l l be
a race between the dejection and anti -
dejection chemists, just as it is today
between the S A M ' s with their changing
gadgetry and the electronic c o u n t e r
measures in the aircraft or I C B M ' s to be
shot down.
The alternative scenario, just as
difficult for'the generals to cope with, is
for a l l the troops to be in such a good
humour that they can't be bothered to deal
with the enemy.
So,as is often the c a s e , this particular
peek into the future has c i v i l and
military connotations.
One thousand identical twins of
Harold Wilson and 1975 Equivalent

But the next peek does not — it is
