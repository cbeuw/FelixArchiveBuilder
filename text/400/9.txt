'Naturallvits Rubber?
Two functions have been held by the society s i n c e the start
of the 1975/76 s e s s i o n . The first of these was the sherry party
organised for new members on October 9th. The o c c a s s i o n
provided an excellent opportunity for members to meet each
other, the proceedings being e n l i v e n e d ' w i t h sherry, soft drinks
and s n a c k s . Three short beautiful and ipformative films on
S r i o L a n k a were a l s o shown.
Members recently v i s i t e d
the Commonwealth Institute in
Kensington High Street. The
Institute's E x h i b i t i o n G a l l e r -
ies are attractive and
•educational with their unique
and colourful portrayals of the
countries that make-up
the Commonwealth.
In the coming month, we
w i l l be holding a film show
on the Rubber Industry. The
films being shown are
' N a t u r a l l y its Rubber',
' E n g i n e e r i n g with Rubber'
and 'Standard M a l a y s i a n
Rubber', The first of these is
a colour film which t e l l s the
story of natural rubber - a
raw material vital to modern
industry.
The film covers a l l aspects
of rubber production, the
progress achieved In cultivat-
ing higher y i e l d i n g trees
and how research has helped
to produce many types of
different purposes. It a l s o
d e a l s with the effect of the
industry on the country's
populace — rubber production
is M a l a y s i a ' s leading
industry.
In February 1976, two
films, ' T i m e for T i n ' and
' T i m a h (Tim)' w i l l be shown.
These are but a few of the
events being put on by the
society t h i s s e s s i o n . The
society welcomes a l l members
of the C o l l e g e to membership
s o that we can share with
each other our own unique
experience and contribute to
the promotion of friendship
and understanding.

Chairman S E A S O C 75/76
T i z a r d in C o u r t
L a s t Sunday saw the
return match of the ICWA
netball team v T i z a r d . Y e s ,
the females of IC dared take
on the burly musclemen of
T i z a r d . Undaunted by the
6ft 2ins stature of the
opposition we set forth into
an • hour long battle. A
walkover thought T i z a r d ,
gallantly a l l o w i n g us to drop
out at the beginning before
we lost our pride. We began
to take hope when losing the
toss, T i z a r d chose " e n d s "
g i v i n g us first centre pass —
Our first inclination that these
men were mere amateurs.
ICWA took the lead straight
away. T h i s soon became
quite boring, so in the second
quarter we allowed them to
take a two goal lead. ( T a c t i c s
all tactics!!!) Now it was up
to big A . She may look
small to you but she is a l l
muscle, as brave Marcelle
found out too late. " H e ran
into m e " she c r i e d , as he
fell to the ground doubled up
in pain. Now we were back
in our stride. Desperately
T i z a r d swopped their men
around, but despite R o b ' s
masterly play, a l l to no avail.
They were destined to lose.
They had everything except
flair. Despite minor inter-
ruptions — the whole ICWA
team being carried off the
pitch they s t i l l couldn't
score and had to settle for
defeat. The final score:
ICWA 21 - T i z a r d 12
Obviously used to defeat
T i z a r d didn't lose heart but
took us a l l to the bar
afterwards. However they
look the worse for wear
today — the game has claimed
many T i z a r d m u s c l e s . R o l l
on Nov 23rd, we w i l l beat
them again.

Clem at Brighton
by Nick Brayshaw
For many, hundreds of vintage car owners, and many hundreds
of thousands of vintage car lovers, the annual London-Brighton
vintage c a r rally on the first Sunday of November is a day not to
be m i s s e d .
F o r Clementine II and the
R S M U , it is an opportunity
to take to the road, and go for
a spi n down the A 2 3 with
thousands of cheering people
helping her on the way.
The event started at the
unearthly hour of 8.30am at
Hyde Park Corner, when a l l
the official entries storm off
down the road. There was a
range of e x p r e s s i o n s on the
faces of the drivers (from
extreme displeasure to shear
amazement) when a gleaming
yellow and black commercial
v e h i c l e , carrying 8 Miners
and two crates of light ale
went roaring past them in the
direction of Brighton (No -
we didn't get lost). Since
C l e m was not an official
entry we were supposed to
meet ' B o (which was an
official entry) on Westminster
Bridge. However, s i n c e being
late at every event is a
privilege afforded to the R S M ,
we d e c i d e d to set off 15
mins behind ' B o (and J e z
which a l s o came along for
the ride).
With Howard " H o t - R o d "
Cheetham at the wheel a 15
min deficit was eaten away
in no time (as were the cluth
plates!). P a s s i n g ' B o 25
miles out of London, we
stopped for a rendezvous only
to find that C l e m wouldn't start
(the turbocharger was playing
up again). The trouble was
soon diagnosed by John
(the RSM Grease Monkey) as
being the rotor arm having
gone astray. P u t t i n g the brain
c e l l into top gear, we came
up with some s i l v e r paper
which soon had C l e m singing
away sweetly. Having caught
up with ' B o and J e z again,
C l e m went tearing into the
lead about 15 m i l e s out from
Brighton. The seating arrange-
ment was then readjusted so
that N i c k " V a m p i r e "
Brayshaw could sit on the roof
waving to the now' e c s t a t i c
verges (we thought they were
going to rush the pitch). T h i s
plan was soon shot up the
a—e when we were pulled up
by the law. Having got of
the roof we carried on r e g a r d -
less and N i c k got back on the
roof again, (the boy's a fool)
just outside Brighton. Then,
the moment we had al I be
waiting for - C l e m arrived at
the front — to be told to clear
off by the law who wouldn't
let us go down to the Prom.
Not daunted by this minor
setback we went down the other
end of the Prom and ot in
there by t e l l i n g the law we
were an official " t e n d e r " .
Having parked, the gal rant
Miners went off in search of
rich suckers (ie people to
buy Rag Mags). Persuading
O A P ' s that they want to
read a book of dirty j o k e s /
pics is no easy task, I can
tell y o u !
Next on the agenda (after
a round of greasy fish and
c h i p s and the rest of the light
ale) was the inter C C U "dodgem
c o m p e t i t o n " . N e e d l e s s to say
Mines emerged victorious by
ramming everything w i t h i n a
hundred yard radius of the
dodgem track.
We decided to return to the
Metropolis (after being skinned
45p for a s t i c k of rock) by
which time it was semi-dark,
and we were s e m i - p . — d . The
gentleman, who designed C l e m
many years ago wants shooting,
as we found out when trying to
drive up the motorway with a
torch to guide u s . The lights*
don't even illuminate the
radiator cap! T a l k i n g of radiator
c a p s , C l e m developed a little
overheating problem and we
used about 10 gallons of water
to keep afloat. X)n reaching
London, C l e m thought it had
behaved itself for long enough
and decided we no longer had
any use for its clutch (well we
certainly didn't get any more
use out of it). So it was that
Howard, in his desperate
attempts to get us away at a set
of lights ignored the lane
markings and caused a pile-up
behind u s .
Enough is- enough we a l l
cried, and so the gallant crew
returned to South Ken (at a
majestic 3mph) in time for the
last pint in the Union bar,
after putting C l e m to bed.
