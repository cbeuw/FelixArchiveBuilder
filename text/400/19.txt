CROSS C O U N T R Y
Determined to avoid a repeat of last years' poor first League
race attendance, the C l u b turned up in strength at Surrey U n i v e r -
sity - despite a late start, a detour for J a n s ' studs and assorted
Guildford B v - P a s s roadworks.
A n x i o u s , perhaps, to
lose the all-mud, he-man-
reputation o f their course,
Surrey shortened it to a
derogatory three and a half
miles by removing every
ploughed field (cries of
shame?)
No wonder Ian (sprinter),
Rob, Dave, Tony and A l f
took less than twenty minutes
to pack into 6 t h , 9 t h , 14th,
19th and 21st places: almost
certainly the winning team.
P a u l , Dave (J), R i c h , Ian,
N e i l , C o l i n , Andy, P e n , A l a n
and Wilf spaced and filled out
the next two IC teams but. the
infamous IC fourth team
stayed its hand/foot/gullet.
A flurry of e x c u s e s (the
Imperial Games) reduced the
IC contingent at the U L v
Cambridge match to Da.ve.iJ,
The long Cambridge course
was fast and, in the event,
hazardous. Taking advantage
of a narrow uphill path in the
fifth mile, an aggravated
swarm ot wasps upset the race
and many runBers collected
five or more painful stings on
their legs and other regions...
Despite the discomfort
the London University team
finished a (close) hundred or
so points behind the front
three Cambridge teams,
Jan 23rd, Paul 39th, Dave 51st
and Wilf 59th - IC first and
'ast.
Ian, P a u l and Wilf. After the"
traditional " w a i t * f o e . the
coach at Molet S t " , the
London team departed north-
wards, but without Borough
Rd who deigned n o M o appear.
On Saturday 1st November
we went to T h e Royal Military
Academy Sandhurst where we
had a very enjoyable race'
against Thames Hare &
Hounds, R M A S , and a local
s c h o o l . Security was high a s
they didn't know that IRA
stood for Imperial Running
A s s o c i a t i o n ... some of us
where in fact searched on
leaving b.ut a l l that was fognd
was a lot of lethal sweaty
running k i t .
Rob A l l i n s o n and Mike
F u l l e r , recently transferred
from Hercules Wimbledon for
an undisclosed sum came in
at 4 & 5 to lead home the IC
team. Ian E l l i s and Dave
Rosen were next in at 8 & 9 .
The first team had returned
when Roman Halenko and
Paul C l a r k e finished 18th &
19th. (No comment about the
fact that the first team a l l
finished in pairs_.)
We were third overall (67pts)
behind T , H & H (52pts) and
R M A S (58pts). The B team
was lead home by another
defector from Wimbledon, B i g
^ o h n ^ h e j a j ^ r ^ ^ o ^ f i p l a ^ e .
Medicine Man Dave Jones was
next, followed by R i c h
Harrington and Wonder B o y
Steve Webb who " j u s t j o g g e d "
round with an injured knee,
just beating John Shearer and
A l f Garnett. T h i s finished the
B team who were fifth with
172pts. There now follows
a two minute s i l e n c e a s we
wait and wait and wait for the
invincjble G team - those
dedicated p i s s artists who
find a l l this running just a
little too tiring...Pete Johnson,
Martin Tarnowski, Andy Davey,
Mike Welford, Ian Isherwood.
L a s t but not least " w a s the
biggest beer" gut Mr P a d
Donnelly, who showed really
bad form in assuring us that it
was 5.30 and not s « when it
was in fact s i x , (opening
time of course). T b e C team
had amassed a c o l o s s a l
280pts, far more than any
other team could manage.
Some fine Moi land's a l e w a s
sampled, accompanied by
random dart playing, which
rounded off a very pleasant
outing.
Orienteering
On Commemoration D a y , a few people where not involved in
the ceremony made their way to Wimbledon Common to try
orienteering. A l l who came, completed their course, despite the
fact that one of the control makers was thrown into a pond (the
Wombles are suspected), and another w a s removed by a 'helpful'
park keeper and placed in a litter bin.
Last Sunday, five members
made the long journey to the
New Forest to compete in the
'November C l a s s i c ' . T h e
young trees and many ditches
made the going very s l o w in
places and by the end of their
courses, everyone w a s pretty
shattered. O n the w a y h o m e ,
the only sound that could be
heard w a s snoring.
R e s u l t s : -
John G i b b i n s won the 6
kilometre course in 101 minutes
while Stewart H i r s l e y won the
3 kilometre course in 52
minutes.
Over 21 ' A ' Course - 11.8Km
David Rosen 95 minutes
A l a n Leakey 118 minutes
Over 21 ' B ' Course - 7.9Km
Pete Johnson 125 minutes
Mike Welford 159 minutes
Under 21 Course - 8.9Km
Tony Warwick 138 minutes
The next event w i l l be on
Sunday November 16th irl
Suffolk and we hope to take a
minibus. Beginners (of both
sexes of course) w i l l be
very welcome.

Last Saturday the A ' s lost for the first time this season. A n
experienced R o s s l y n Park side inflicted the heaviest defeat the
A's had experienced for two seasons. However, things were not
as black a s they may appear from the score. R o s s l y n Park d i d
not have it a l l their own way and IC were desperately unlucky.
IC had a disastrous start to
the game, giving away a try
during the first few minutes.
There w a s worse to come.
Almost' immediately Gwyn
Davies had to leave the field
with an injured arm. That
demoralised the A ' s and
R o s s l y n Park seized their
chance and ran in s i x tries
before half time. However, the
A ' s finished the half w e l l with
R i c h Jenner following up
quickly from a five yard scrum
to gain an opportunist try. That
left IC 28 — 4 down.
In the second half the A ' s
completely changed their
a t t i t u d e a n d s t a r t e d t o
pressurise the opposition. F o r
some twenty minutes Park were
forced to defend in their own
twenty-five. However, this
period bore no fruit and was
ended by a Park breakaway try
caused by a dreadful mistake
by the A ' s backs. T h e game
then became more open and in
the final twenty minutes the
A ' s scored through a good
piece of back play supported
by Chris Becque who chipped
the ball through to score
e a s i l y . The final try was scored
by Park in the last minute
when the A ' s were down to
thirteen men due to Rich Jenner
going off with a leg injury.
In the end, defeat, but not
humiliation, for an IC side of
fourteen men that had a run of
unbelievably bad luck and had
pressurised a much heavier
R o s s l y n Park pack. No mean
achievement.
Many thanks to a l l who
turned out, including the A ' s
supporter.

At 1 2 . 3 0 J o n P i t c h e r made h i s fastest run of the day. It w a s
a run of about 400 yards, not, actually, to collect a perfect pass
but to collect a lazy number eight plus a set of shirts. A s usual,
e s p e c i a l l y when there i s ho opposition,' Jon made it and returned
gripping R i c h Jenner who swore that the notice had stated 12.45
putting the fourteen men who had turned up at 1 2 . 1 5 firmly in
the wrong.
Having sorted that out we
th ought our troubles were over
for the day but then we saw
the pitch. It w a s the right
s i z e , a l l right, and more or
less flat, but there were cows
a l l over it treating it with that
casual disrespect so particular
to c o w s . A s , once again, we
had turned up half an hour
early there w a s plenty of time '
to deal with the cows before
kick off.
Soon after start it w a s
obvious that we were g o i n g .
to have a hard game. T h e
opposition seemed to be more
concerned with trying to cripple
us than with trying to play a
good game of rugby. T h e IC
pack- dominated the game
throughout but our backs
(disorientated by an exception-
ally wide pitch - perhaps the
better to accommodate the
cows) made many mistakes.
IC opened the scoring when
Dave Turner dropped a goal,
compensating for some less
satisfactory dropping during
the game. Very soon after that
we lost the lead. A series of
mistakes let E a s t London
through for a try which they
converted e a s i l y . IC went
straight back at them and
soon the lead changed hands
again. Our forwards won the
ball and after some good
interpassing gave it to B o b
L e s s o n who scored a fine try,
his first this s e a s o n .
The second half opened
with IC leading 9 - 6 , but it
was not until Dave Turner
kicked a penalty that E a s t
London started to lose heart.
From then on w e were al I
over them and in the final
twenty minutes we ran in three
tries, one by N i c k Morton and
two by A l Harery (playing
hooker). That gave a final
score of 26—6 in our favour.
It is always satisfying to
beat a team like E a s t London
by playing good rugby instead
of reverting to a l l - i n thugery.
Every man of the A ' s piayed
his part and played it w e l l .
The forwards had a particularly
good game and nobody would
begrudge Rod Porter and John
Fishburn a mention. T h e backs
stood up well to some v i c i o u s
tackling, a n d it is a wonder
that C h r i s Becque and John
Pitcher were s t i l l on their
feet at the end of it a l l .
