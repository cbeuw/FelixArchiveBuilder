IC radio to
get licence soon
cm
V J l _ l
IC Radio have received
a letter from the Home Office
regarding their application
for a test l i c e n s e . T h i s
follows a v i s i t recently by
G P O engineers to look into
the technical aspects of
setting-up a station on
campus. They apparently are
of the opinion that the Idea
i s feasible.
IC Radio have been asked,
by the Home Office, to look
into various aspects of their
design for a studio and
outside wiring of the h a l l s
of residence. T h i s means for
instance, including a means
of varying output power —
Steve Brightman's design d i d
not a l l o w for this — and the
aerial positions on some of
the halls need to be revised.
IC Radio do not seem to
see any difficulties with
complying with these mod-
ifications although it means,
in the c a s e of the a e r i a l s , a
virtually c o m p l e t e new
system has to be worked out.
John A l l e n , of IC R a d i o ,
commented! " W e were relieved
to receive a positive reply
after nearly a year of waiting.
There does not seem to be any
substantial difficulties with
regard to carrying out the
suggestions put forward by
the Home Office.
"It looks a s if a test
license could soon be on the
w a y " .
