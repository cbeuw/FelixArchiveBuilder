The team of IC climbers taking part in the expedition: (I to r) Mark
Dixon, Mike Homer, Bill Alexander, Neil Travers, Andy Fanshawe
and Simon Lamb.
An extinct volcano in Ecuador is
the objective of an expedition
being undertaken by IC Moun-
taineering Club this summer. A
team of six students will spend
nearly three months pioneering
new routes in the Andes and
carrying out scientific work in
fields such as meterology and
geology.
The volcano, El Altar, rises to
a height of 5,465m and is
regarded as one of the most
spectacular and challenging
peaks in South America. The
team hopes to make the first
British ascent of Obispo, the
highest peak of E l Altar.
The group will be giving a
presentation in College next
session on the outcome of the
expedition. They are being spon-
sored by IC Exploration Board,
W H Smith, Waitrose, Wool-
worths and NatWest Bank.
The expedition is also being
helped by IC Bookshop, Sher-
field Refectory and the Health
Centre. A raffle is presently being
held as the latest in a series of
fund raising efforts by the team.

The College has set up a new
Centre for Composite Materials
to co-ordinate research and
expertise in this important and
expanding area of engineering.
The Centre will be a central point
of contact in the College for
industrial users of such materials.
The Maths department has
formed a Mathematical Advice
Centre to co-ordinate its
consultancy to staff and research
students in other departments.
The College has raised a total of
£7,655,915 in research contracts
this session up to March from a
total of 229 projects.
Two IC students attended the
International Conference of
Students in Science and
T e c h n o l o g y ( I N C O S T ) in
Helsinki during the vacation. A
full report will appear in F E L I X
shortly.
About £200 has been claimed in
expenses for travel, food and
accommodation by the two IC
observers sent to the NUS
Conference during the vacation.
A report of the conference is on
page 6.
The E n v i r o n m e n t a l Safety
Group at IC has been awarded a
contract by the Department of
the Environment to investigate
enhanced levels of radioactivity
in domestic dust. They will be
analysing samples of dust and
assessing the radiological
significance of their radio-
activity.
Professor Bruce Say<;rs has been
elected as Dean of the City and
Guilds College in succession to
Professor Henry Sawistowski,
who relinguished the post on 20
April.
Professors J B Pendry and F T
Smith of Physics and Maths
respectively were elected Fellows
of the Royal Society in March.

The installation of new security
locks on the entrances to the
Southside Halls of Residence has
been delayed due to problems
with their design. The locks will
be magnetic, operated by a small
key-card, the size of a key fob,
which will be issued to each
resident.
The new security/ system will
involve two sets of doors on each
entrance. The outer doors will be
as at present, opened by the
residents' room keys. Inside there
will be a second set of doors
operated by the magnetic cards.
The Selkirk/Keogh entrance al-
ready has two sets of doors, but
the Tizard/Falmouth entrance at
present only has one set. Work
has recently begun on the instal-
lation of a second set inside the
present doors.
The reason for the delay is
problems with the matching of
the magnetic device with the
College's A S S A locks. When
fitted there was a gap between the
device and the door which would
have allowed the lock to be
interfered with. The company
supplyikng the magnetic devices,
Cor Keys, has now solved this
problem and is expected to
demonstrate the modifided
device to the College this week.
Geoffrey Reeves, College
Security Officer, told F E L I X
that he hoped the new locks
would be installed later this term.
He said no decision had yet been
taken on the hours when the
doors would he locked with the
new locks. At present the doors
are locked at 7:00pm every night.

Southside residents were kept
awake for two hours from
4:00am Wednesday morning due
to a fault in the Southside fire
alarm system. This is the latest of
a series of false alarms since the
installation of the £100,000
system.
Wednesday's false alarm was
due to a faulty detector going off
spontaneously. The source could
not be located from the central
monitoring board and an
engineer had to be called in
during the night to fix the system.
The alarm went off intermittantly
for two hours as each detector
was tested to locate the fault. The
main Southside security desk was
flooded with calls from angry
Southside residents who had
been woken by the disturbance.
In a letter to the Estates section
Dr Henry Hutchinson, Warden
of Selkirk and Tizard Halls has
expressed concern about the
frequency of the false alarms and
the fact that people are now
ignoring the alarm.
Fire and Safety Officer M r Bob
F o g g o n said that smoke
detectors in kitchens were being
replaced by less sensitive heat
detectors and that although the
system's teething troubles were
not completely ironed out the
'battle was being won'.
The new system has been in
operation for four weeks and was
installed to bring the Southside
Halls in line with the fire
regulations contained in the 1971
Hotel Accommodation Act.
Although the Act does not cover
student accommodation the
College have been forced to
install the new system because of
the increased letting of the Halls
as Hotel accommodation over
the summer. Since then the
system has gone off several times
during the Easter vacation,
mainly due to over sensitive
smoke detectors in the kitchens.
