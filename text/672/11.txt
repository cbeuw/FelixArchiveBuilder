Tonight is the R C S U Annual
Country House Ball. If you ain't
got a ticket then hard luck—try
again next year. If you have then
meet in Bot/Zoo for some sherry
at 6:30pm.
Then on Sunday we have Jez's
Brighton Run starting from the
garage at 6:30am or to wave her
off at 7:15 at Battersea Park. If
you want to come along for the
trip then find Gareth Fish and
promise faithfully to work on the
beast for the next 48hrs and he
might find a space.
Coming up in the next couple
of weeks are: the A G M , a
glorious mixture of pomp and
ceremony and mixes, joint Gen
Comm, where if you've ever
wondered what happens when
you play wine draughts watch
someone from the exec lose.
That is, of course, followed on
the weekend of 19-20 May by the
IC Rag Fete, with lots of stalls,
trips up Queens Tower etc on
Saturday afternoon, and a trip to
Biggin Hill Airfair on 20 May—
see G Fish for details.
