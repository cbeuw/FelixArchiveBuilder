PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO UGM.
Union Receptionist.
Jo, our receptionist has left. She has accepted a job in Graphic Design
(her original qualification) and thoroughly enjoying her new job. W
e a l l
wish her the best of luck and many thanks for a l l she has done for ICU.
Union Refectory.
At the end of last term College were considering radical changes to the
Union Lower Refectory. IC Union put the proposal to College that the
Union manage the Lower Refectory. W
e have been compiling information on
similar refectory outlets since last August. The proposal has been
discussed with Simon Perry,Refectory Committee Chairman and John Smith,
College Secretary. The last issue of Felix gave a misleading impression
regarding whether or not the decision for ICU to manage the refectory had
been taken. The decision has not been taken yet. W
e will be continuing
the discussions on Tuesday 1st May. I expect a final decision to be
taken at this meeting, and then i f a favourable decision is made, the
proposal taken to the Rector's Policy Committee on M
a
y 8th. I will report
verbally at the U
G
M the outcome of the various meetings. If College ever
manage to make a decision.
Student Residence.
Together with representatives from the Hall and House Wardens I have
compiled a report noting a l l the outstanding aspects of the Lauwerys
Residence Report and any unsatisfactory aspects of the recent decisions
taken regarding student residence. This report will be discussed at the
Studen*. Residence Committee on Wednesday 2nd May, as will the student rents
for next year. I will report any decisions taken verbally at the UGM.
I:;COST.
Steve Bishop was unable to attend the INGOST 198M Conference, and so
Joanna Claydor accompanied Jim Boucher to Helsinki to represent IC. I
approached the Rector asking for financial help with travelling costs for
tae delegates, which he agreed to do. The Conference was extremely success-
ful, the delegates are expected to give a full report to next Council. One
of tne outcomes of the Conference was the suggestion that IC host INCOST
1535. At present I a
m looking into the feasibility of hosting INCOST 1985,
trie subject of which will be Biotechnology, and will be discussing the issue
witft College on Wednesday. Anyone interested in helping please come and see
.

S Conference.
Following the last decision at a U
G
M to send observers to N
U
S Conference,
Laveftoweand Hugh Stiles represented I
C at the Easter Conference in Hull.
They intend to report their impressions both in Felix and at the next
Council.
Transport.
Due to a re-vamping of present transport booking procedures, I have been
negotiating deals with some local hire companies so that vans may be hired
at lower rates than present commercial charges. At present two companies
look promising.
President's Report/continued...
7. Southside G
y
m and Central Laundrette.
The Southside G
y
m is now complete! The Central Laundrette, as far as I
a
m aware is incomplete, however, I a
m assured the completion is imminent.
8. Security.
At the end of last term several meetings were held between the Chairman of
the Student Residence Committee, Estates, the Security Officer, the South-
side Wardens and myself, to discuss security in the Southside Halls. Due
to the costs of security and messenger personnel being transferred onto the
residence account, a new system of messenger and security manning was
proposed - to reduce costs and in order to maintain a high level of security,
changes to the Southside Entrances were proposed. The work has been started
and should have been completed for the beginning of term - however, it is
behind schedule! The proposed system is a set of double doors on both
entrances, the outer being on an ASSA key system, the inner on a key card
system. The entrances may also be monitored by a TV camera.
9. House Wardens and Head Tenancy Managers.
A mumber of wardens and head tenancy managers are leaving at the end of this
academic session. Anyone interested in applying for such positions should
obtain an application form from the IC Union Office. The deadline for
applications is Monday 21st M
a
y 198-U.
DEPUTY PRESIDENT'S REPORT TO UGM.
1. Travel Centre.
A three way contract has been signed between the Union, College and STA
enabling STA to trade at Imperial under the banner 'UL'J Travel at IC*.
The travel centre is being installed in the North West corner of the JCR
on the site of the old bar counter and should be open by the second week
of this term. The office will be open normal office hours during terra
and will provide a full range of travel services though Railcards will not
be available.
2. Self Defence.
W
e are s t i l l waiting for the Metropolitan Police to set a date for the self
defence course jt Imperial (these are heavily in demand!). It is unlikely
that we will be able to run a course this term but I a
m optimistic about
being able to offer a course in October. Notes have been circulated to a l l
those who showed an interest in the course and I will continue to collect
names and notify people further when a date is set.
3. Estimates of Expenditure 84/85.
The Union Estimates are now being churned through the College system and I
will not know until later in M
a
y the outcome. W
e will be discussing
estimates at UFC on the 22nd May (note changed date) following the College
Finance and Exec meeting.
4. Bars.
You will probably have noticed that the prices of draught products have
changed. Most have gone down despite the Budget increase of 2p - 3p per
pint. I a
m now looking at other product areas and hope to see further
price decreases particularly in spirits.
The guest beers for this month are Burton in the Union and one of Flowers
or Springfield in Southside. W
e have introduced Castlemaine lager into
our range.
5. Refectories.
You will already have read that we have approached College about the
possibility of taking over the Union Refectory and a decision should have
been made by the time of this meeting.
W
e have also continued to press for firmer control and better management
of College Refectories. However, a discussion at the last meeting of
Refectory Committee about the targets for individual outlets - whether
profitable outlets should subsidize unprofitable outlets was considered
inappropriate by the Chairman leaving m
e to wonder exactly what Refectory
Committee is there for. It s t i l l seems that administrators condone gross
mismanagement rather than have to introduce change.
6. Trnasport. â€¢
W
e have sold O
B
W and are presently awaiting delivery of the new van which
will be a 17 seater, we are also setting a discount arrangement with one of
the major van hire companies.
After much discussion at the end of the last term we have agreed on a new
membership and format for Transport Committee which will be similar to
Union Finance Committee. After the constitution has been approved by
Council the revamped committee should start work by the end of this term.
