Nasty
and
Vindictive
Dear Pallab
I am moved to write a nasty
and vindictive letter about
Michael Newman.
One would think that Michael
Newman, with a brain the size of
a star system, would be able to
ensure the publication of his
magnum opus The Wellsian in
good time to publicise the H G
Wells' anniversary celebrations,
given six months in which to
complete his task. But no, it
comes out to inform everyone of
what they've just missed.
Michael Newman will perhaps
in time develop sufficient matur-
ity and strength of character to
fully comprehend the meaning of
the word 'commitment'. Perhaps
also he might mature enough to
realise that there are two sides to
every argument and that he
should desist from ramming his
purile sexual clean-up fantasies
down the throats of students far

maturer than himself. That might
even give him more time for his
commitments.
I must say that Michael
Newman is certainly honest and
forthright, but quite clearly he
has not grasped that honesty
without humility and forthright-
ness without thought are not
virtues. Is he honest and forth-
right enough with himself to
realise that this can never be any
substitute for grey matter be-
tween the ears? The sooner he
asks himself just what the fuck
he's doing on this planet the
sooner he will emerge from the
primordial slime of intellectual
puberty he is currently flashing at
a disinterested student body. The

public doesn't bother me, but
mass exposure of the rantings
and ravings of a puny and
undemanding intellect like
Michael Newman's offends me
greatly. People will tell you that
size isn't important but take it
from me that it most certainly is.

ism of the Royal School of Mines
Newsletter.
It would appear that Michael
Newman has hit on a further
tactic in his campaign against
alleged pornographic acts, films
and shows as perpetrated by
R S M U .
Whilst I respect his right to
campaign as actively as he likes to
change Union policy or even the
minds of individuals by picketing
the Revue, I should like to point
out two things.
1. Traditionally the Revue is
not a vast money spinner and is
probably only kept alive due to
the publicity afforded it by 'do-
gooders' attempting to protect
the minds of the innocents. The
cost of publicity was halved due
to all the posters, drawing
attention to the revue, put up by
the protestors.
2. Vandalising the Newsletter
could be conceivably considered
a criminal act and has caused
further expense to the Union.
This is not behaviour that is likely
to command respect.
Yours sincerely
David Hobbs
