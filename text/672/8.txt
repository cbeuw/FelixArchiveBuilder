Vacancies for Head Tenancy Managers
THE WARDEN
The Warden is based at Hamlet
Gardens and a self-contained flat
is available which would be
suitable for a single person or for
a couple.
The Warden is responsible for
the management of Hamlet
Gardens, the largest of the head
tenancies (see below for what this
involves) but is also responsible
for general issues in all of the
head tenancies and arranges
meetings with the head tenancy
managers where these issues can
be discussed. The Warden
represents the head tenancy
managers on the Students'
Residence Committee. The ideal
candidate for this role would be a
postgraduate student with at
least two years left at College.
THE MANAGERS
The accommodation which is
available for the managers is
normally only suitable for a
single person.
The manager's role can be
considered under three headings:
1. Domestic
Before residents move in the
manager is responsibile for
making a note of the readings on
all gas and electricity meters, so
that any bill sent to students can
be verified. The manager is
responsible f o r checking-
residents in at the beginning of
the session and giving out keys.
Throughout the term, various
domestic supplies such as bin
bags, cleaning materials and light
bulbs are required. The manager
is responsible for obtaining these
from the College Stores.
In those head tenancies where
cleaners are employed the
manager should ensure that this
is properly carried out.
The landlord is usually
responsible for the majority of
repairs but because repairs cost •
money, a manager will soon learn
Although managing a head tenancy involves a certain amount of hard
work, the main requirement is an interest in Residence and a comm itment
to making your head tenancy a success—socially, administratively and
financially.
We are currently looking for two managers for Lexham Gardens, one
• for Hamlet Gardens and one for 8 Earls Court Square who wo»ld take
over at the beginning of next session.
We are also looking for a Warden who will have responsibilities in
respect of all the head tenancies.
to detect just the slightest hint of
reluctance i n the landlord's
manner when the question . of
repairs is mentioned. Neverthe-
less, it is the manager's job to
report defects to the landlord and
encourage him to rectify them.
At the beginning of each
session managers should collect a
list of all existing defects. This is
partly to prevent the new tenants
being blamed for damage caused
by the previous occupants.
2. Finance
The manager is responsible for
collecting the bills and bill
reminders from Student Services
and delivering them to the
students. Prompt action is
essential in this area. Managers
are also expected to chase up
outstanding Bills.
In some head tenancies,
managers have to empty gas,
electricity and telephone meters.
Occasionally at the beginning
of session, the managers collect
any unpaid deposits as students
move in.
3. Social and Discipline
Much of the head tenancy
accommodation is in the form of
flats, which tend to generate their
own social life. Others are more
like Student Houses where it is
very important to give the lead in
organising social ever'..'.
In all the head tenancies the
manager is responsible for
making sure that no nuisance is
caused to neighbours and that no

damage is caused to the
accommodation. Managers need
to have a weekly 'clinic' where
residents can report defects and
when other matters can be dealt
with.
Although this description
makes being a manager look like
a full time job, in fact it is not as
bad as it sounds.
Most things only have to be
done once or twice a term and are
not particularly time consuming.
Nevertheless, these jobs involve a
high degree of responsiblity and
commitment and i f you are
thinking of applying you will
need to talk to your personal
tutor or supervisor before doing
so..
The work tends to be
concentrated into specific
periods such as the beginning of
term (particularly the first term).
Experience has shown that
research students find it easier to
reconcile the management role,
with their academic work.
The job can be demanding at
times. Student Services is able to
help with many problems, but the
manager is often left to his/her
own devices.
Nevertheless, it provides an
excellent opportunity for anyone
who is interested in Residence to
develop administrative a n d
management skills.
If you are interested, and
would like to discuss what the job
involves in more detail, please
come to see me in Student
Services.
