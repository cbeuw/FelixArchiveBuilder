NEWSPAPFB OF IMPERIAL COLLEGE UNION
ROWE RESIGNS
Publications Board Chairman David Rowe resigned yesterday
afternoon after an Exec decision not to purchase an Alternative
Prospectus Editor's pot.
The decision to have a pot had
already been approved by Pub
Board itself, and also by IC
Union Council. After the Exec
turned down the decision once,
M r Rowe wrote to the Exec
explaining that he would be
forced to resign if they didn't
reverse their decision.
Pots are normally purchased
for well-established Union posts
and M r Rowe felt that the A P
Editor's post fell into this
category.
Anger was expressed by A P
Editors past and present. The
production of this year's A P will
not be affected, however.
It is unusual for the Executive,
which comprises the three
sabbatical officers and the C C U
Presidewnts, to overturn Council
decisions. The Constitution
allows the Exec to make
decisions on domestic matters
Dave Rowe: Disappointed
and matters of urgency affecting
the day to day running of the
Union. Exec Committee minutes
are subject to scrutiny by I C U
Council.
HewGym
The new gym facility i n
Southside completed over the
Southside was completed over
the vacation and is now available
for use by Union clubs. The gym
is the former refectory, and the
conversion consists of a single
changing room, two showers and
toilets in one corner of the room.
The new laundrette in the
former ladies toilet in Southside
basement is now almost complete
and should be open on Monday.
The laundrette has eight washing
machines and four driers. It is
expected that the charge will be
50p for a wash.
Meanwhile progress on the
new S T A office in the J C R has
been slower than expected. It
now seems unlikely the office will
open on Monday as planned.
Refectory
The Chairman of the Refectory
Committee, Dr Simon Perry, will
be presenting proposals for the
Union takeover of the refectory
in the Union Building at a
meeting of the Rector's Policy
Committee on Tuesday.
It was reported in F E L I X No
671 that the Union taking control
of the refectory had been agreed
in principle by College Secretary
John Smith. Since then detailed
discussions have taken place
between the College and the
Union to iron out the details.
U n i o n D e p u t y P R e s i d e n t
Christine Teller said she felt that
the Union had made its case well
and felt confident that approval
for the takeover will be given on
Tuesday.
Porn Rumpus
An allegedly pornographic story
has overshadowed the launch of
IC's literary magazine, The
Phoenix.
The magazine went on sale for
the first time on Wednesday this
week. Already there have been
complaints about the story,
which deals explicitly with scenes
of rape and 'impure acts alone'
The article, a short story by
Michael Newman, has been
described as "shocking and
degrading to w o m e n " by
Christine Teller, Union Deputy
President. M r Newman is,
ironically, better known for his
outspoken campaign against
pornography on the College
campus.
"The story does contain
shocking and disgusting things,
and things that degrade women,"
said M r Newman. "I wasn't
careful enough when writing the
story. I believe that I have the
right to write such an article; I do
not believe that anyone else has
the right to put on pornographic
displays. M y opinions on that
have not changed one jot," he
added.
E x - P u b l i c a t i o n s B o a r d
Chairman David Rowe was tight-
lipped and ashen-faced on
Wednesday after reading The
Phoenix. "I went rigid when I
read the article," he said, "It was
like a bolt from the blue."
â€¢ A t the time of going to press,
The Phoenix is available from the
Bookshop and libraries, price
30p.
