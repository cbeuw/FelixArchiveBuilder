Dear Sir
The abow society is contem-
plating an 'xoedition to a well-
known Lancashire pothole, with
the aim of being the first to
bicycle (a light vehicle for one
person consisting of two large,
spoked, tandem wheels, a steer-
ing handle and a saddle on which
the rider sits to work two pedals
which, by making a chain engage
in a series of cogs, drive the back
wheel) to these eerie underworld
caverns.
This undertaking is to raise
money for charitv, and we were-
,
therefore, hoping that your
readers may be interested. If so
they may contact the under-
signed.
Yours faithfully „ N
