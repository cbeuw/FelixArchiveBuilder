LORDS VINDICATE fCU
Hundreds of overseas students could be eligible for refunds of their fees
and back-dated home student grants from Local Authorities, following
a ruling in the House of Lords last month. The judgement was the
culmination of a five-year legal battle started by Imperial College
Union.
The Lords ruled that students
who have lived in Great Britain
for three years or more (including
those who came here on student
visas for purely educational
purposes and have no intention
of remaining in Britain after
their courses) are eligible for
Local Education Authority
grants. As a direct consequence,
it seems certain that these
people, who have until now paid
the high fees imposed on over-
seas students, will now be
entitled to register as home
students, whose fees are con-
siderably lower and paid to the
universities by local authorities.
It is reasonable to expect that ihe
fees paid by the students to tne
colleges will have to be refunded.
In addition, the increase in the
number of H o m e Students
means that College have ex-
ceeded the ' H o m e Student
Quota' imposed by the Univer-
sities Grants Council. This is the
maximum number of students
paying the lower fees that a
College may accept in any year;
one thousand and fifty for
Imperial College last year.
Colleges are encouraged to accept
as many overseas students as
possible, because their indepen-
dently paid fees (which have
doubled in the last three years)
are a major source of income to
the Department of Education
and Science. Colleges that
exceed their home student quota
face severe financial penalties,
although in the case of Imperial
and several other colleges which
Michael Arthur, whose appeal has
been upheld by the Lords.
have received preferential
treatment as 'centres of ex-
cellence', these may well be
waived.
The wording of the 1962
Education Act is that students
who have been 'Ordinary Resi-
dent' in Britain for three years
are eligible for grants. In
January of 1978, the Department
of Education of Science sent a
circular to Local Authorities
suggesting that people who had
entered Britain on Student Visas
to take O and A Levels before
going to universities were not
ordinarily resident because they
were here for educational
purposes only, and many in-
tended to leave the country as
soon as they had qualified. Local
Authorities took this as an
instruction to refuse awards, not
only to these people but to
virtually all students who did not
hold a British passport—in-
cluding one whose father had
lived in Britain for seventeen
years.
A number of test cases chal-
lenging these refusals were taken
to court, among them one
brought by Imperial College
Welfare Officer Michael Officer
and Mary Attenborough, then
I C U President, on behalf of
Shahin Bagha, a first-year
undergraduate in metallurgy.
For nearly five years Michael
Arthur and successive presidents
saw the cases go through Divi-
sional Courts and Courts of
Appeal until on December 16 last
year the House of Lords ruled
that any resident with a settled
purpose — i n c l u d i n g that of
education — is an 'Ordinary
Resident'. In his speech, Lord
Scarman ruled that education is
a settled purpose, and that
Immigration States and future
intentions were irrelevant.
