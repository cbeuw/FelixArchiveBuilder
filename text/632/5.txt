Southside Security
Three years ago a female student
was raped in Southside. A man
used the lift to take her down to
the basement so that no one
would be able to hear her cries
for help. As a result of this, it
was decided that security in the
building was too lax and that
everything possible should be
done to prevent such a thing
happening again. This is why the
'basement' buttons on the
Southside lifts are now sensibly
fitted with key switches, and why
there are wide-angled mirrors in
the entrance lobbies.
But another measure was
introduced at the same time, and
one which is by no means
obligatory for the security of the
Hall: it was decided that the
outer doors which lead into the
lobbies should be locked at
6:00pm and that all the doors
should be locked at 7:00pm.
What does this achieve, apart
from inconveniencing several
hundred students and their
friends? While it is necessary to
shut out a wide v a r i e t y . o f
undesirables, ranging from
potential rapists to thieves to
tramps and illicit users of the
laundry, one wonders how is this
achieved by locking up as early
as 7:00 rather than at 11:30. say,
when the bars are shut and social
activities begin to wind down.
On Saturdays and Sundays the
position is even more ludicrous,
for the security guards them-
selves are in some doubt as to
the official time of locking and
unlocking, and it is never clear
when access to the building is
available; often the doors are
locked all weekend. Surely to
protect the b u i l d i n g from
intruders the doors should be
locked at the most likely times
for an intrusion: during the
daytime when there are few
people about. It seems par-
ticularly pointless to lock the
doors at 7:00pm when they are
opened at 5:00am.
It is often said that locking the
d o o r doesn't really i n c o n -
venience visitors, since it's a
simple matter to use the internal
telephone to call someone to the
door, but anyone who uses this
argument clearly doesn't appre-
ciate the inherent difficulties. To
. begin with, it is necessary to find
an internal phone: itself no easy
task when the bar is shut. Then
you need the phone number,
which is accessible if you are
trying to contact someone in
Falmouth-Keogh and you know
his r o o m number, but the
internal phone directory has no
numbers for the staircase phones
in Selkirk or Tizard. Linstead
doesn't even have a compre-
hensive telephone system at all.
A n d knowing the telephone
number is no help if your friends
are in the laundry, the television
lounge, the kitchen, or anywhere
else except their room.
This is annoying, but there are
more serious consequences.
Irritated by the inconvenience of
the security arrangements,
students get round them in two
potentially dangerous ways.
There are doors into South-
side which are meant to be
permanently locked, but can be
left open by anyone with access
to the b u i l d i n g . Southside
residents often open the doors
when they are expecting visitors;
as a result the doors are often left
open well into the night, when it
is important to restrict entry.
Secondly, so many residents
are aware of the massive incon-
venience caused by locking up at
7:00 that they will gladly allow
anyone to follow them into the
building at any hour of the day
or night. In fact I have even seen
a note left pinned to the door of
Southside: 'Dear X , come and
see me in room Y Y Y , if this door
is locked wait for someone else
to go in and follow them.'
So let's outline some practical
suggestions. There is certainly a
case for l e a v i n g Southside
unlocked until 11:30pm and not
opening it until 7:00am, and
these times should apply at
weekends too. There should be a
notice on the doors warning
students not to allow strangers
into the building, such a sign
would not only remind residents
of the dangers, but would also
make it psychologically much
easier to refuse strangers access.
And finally, there are internal
telephones lying idle just inside
the doors of Southside. Would
the expense be too great to
move them outside enabling
bona fide visitors to phone their
friends at any time of the day or
night?
It is impossible to make a
student H a l l of Residence
completely secure; but until
something is done about South-
side we will be forced to live with
a system which does very little to
enforce security, and only serves
to irritate the residents.
Staff Vacancies
There is always room on the
F E L I X staff, especially for
writers (see me early in the week)
and collators (just turn up on
Thursday evening), but over the
Christmas holiday two important
vacancies have arisen.
Firstly, since Hugh Southey
has been elected Editor of the
Alternative Prospectus he will be
unable to continue as What's On
Coordinator. This job is hard
work and needs considerable
commitment: the entries have to
be sorted and written up early in
the week (about an hour's work)
and then laid out and pasted up
on Tuesday or Wednesday (at
least six hours' workâ€”say a
whole evening). The job is not
one to be taken on lightly, but
w i l l , as they say, p r o v i d e
considerable satisfaction to a
reasonably tidy and conscien-
tious worker with a good eye for
l a y o u t . A n y o n e interested
should see Hugh or me in the
F E L I X Office.
The other vacancy is staff
photographer, who liases with
the news editor and other
photographers and tries to
capture the important hap-
penings around IC on film. The
perks of the job include using all
the F E L I X photographic equip-
ment (including, when necessary,
the Mamiya polaroid camera);
the commitment is to spend time
on Wednesday afternoon in the
d a r k r o o m , d e v e l o p i n g and
printing up to half a dozen films.
Anyone interested, see me at any
time.
Copy Deadline
Copy for next Friday's F E L I X
should be in by Monday 5:30pm,
but anything for inclusion in the
spring term calendar must be in
by 5:30 today.
Christmas FELIX
There are a few Christmas
FELICES left (although the free
gift is not as fresh as it was in
December) and also lots of last
year's The Phoenix all available
free from the F E L I X Office.

all the usual crowd, to wit, Hugh
Southey for What's On, Adrian
James for news, Lee Paddon,
Nick Bedding and Nigel Brand
for reviews, Walkabout-Looksee
and Gastropod for their res-
pective columns, P i n o c c h i o ,
Dave Jago, Nick Pyne, Paul
Philippou, Peter Rodgers for all
kinds of help, Chris Mallaband

and Pete the Printer.
