INEWSI
Round Britain
Flat Out
A team from City and Guilds
College is organising a sponsored
non-stop pedal-car ride around
the coastline of Britain next July.
The participants hope to raise
£10,000 for the Royal National
Lifeboat Institution (RNLI), and
to qualify for an entry in the
Guinness Book Of Records.
The vehicle that they will use
is the Windcheetah Street Legal
Human Powered Vehicle (HPV)
made by Burrows Engineering of
Norwich, enclosed in an aero-
dynamic composite bodysheli
designed in the College. H P V
enthusiasts claim that these
machines are more comfortable,
warmer and faster over long
distances than bicycles—the
Windcheetah cruises com-
f o r t a b l y at 3 0 m p h . It is
hoped that the 3,675 mile route
will be covered at an average
speed of 20mph, taking about
ten days to complete the journey.
The team will be divided into
groups of four working in eight-
hour shifts. The groups will be
based in fully-equipped Dor-
mobile-type vans in which they
will escort the pedaller. Three
groups of four will cover the first
five days of the journey before
handing over to another three
groups. On top of the partici-
pants' expenses, the team hope to
raise enough money to buy an
engine for a Brede-class RNLI
lifeboat. This they will do by
personal and industrial sponsor-
ship, and by selling the twenty-
four square feet of advertising
space on the bodyshell.
Anyone interested in taking
part in the trip (there are still
places in the team, and the
organisers claim that you need
not be an ultra-fit racing cyclist)
should be at the meeting at
1:30pm on Tuesday January 18
in R o o m 342, M e c h a n i c a l
Engineering, or contact John
Gilday (Chemistry 3) or anyone
in the Guilds Union Office.
Jezebel Violated
Taking it all lying down-the Windcheetah Street Legal Human
Powered Vehicle without its body (which has yet to be built).
A headlamp and a bearing
belonging to RCS's motorised
mascot Jezebel are in the hands of
Queen Mary College Students'
Union.
They were stolen on the last
Wednesday of last term, but
RCS did not discover who was
responsible until last Wednesday.
According to Duncan Batty, the
RCS Motor Club Chairman,
three people came to see him at
Jez's Garage where he was
working on December 15. Two
of them pretended to want to
join the Motor Club and started
discussing the matter with M r
Batty, while the third dis-
appeared behind Jez and took a
headlamp and a bearing which
was being repaired after damage
on Morphy Day. The theft was
not discovered until later that
evening.
Mr Batty revealed that the
equipment, worth £600, was
only traced when he personally
telephoned the President of
Q M C U to find out whether she
knew anything about it.
Q M C U want to exchange the
stolen parts for their mascot,
Mary, which was violated by
RCSU last year. However, Jez is
not a violate mascot and QMCU's
action is thus against mascotry
rules. M r Batty has asked
Q M C U to return the missing
parts and eventually negotiate
Mary's handover with RCSU's
Vice-President Fiona Owen.
'The only ones to suffer are
the Motor Club members, as the
bearing needs repairing and we
will not be able to run Jez for at
least another couple of weeks,'
said Mr Batty, who has also
written a letter of complaint to
the Principal of Q M C .

Flowers' Powers
The Rector of Imperial College,
Lord Flowers, is to lead a two
year investigation by a commit-
tee of experts into the British
town and country planning
system. The inquiry, funded by
the Nuffield F o u n d a t i o n , is
likely to recommend changes in
the system of public inquiries
into major building and environ-
mental developments, such as
the current controversial inquiry
into plans to build a pressurised
water nuclear reactor at Sizewell.
Lord Flowers believes that the
present planning system devised
to deal only with 'little, local
difficulties' is in need of reform.
He has previously chaired a
government commission which
produced a major report on
environmental pollution. His
work with this new inquiry is not
likely to affect his work as
Rector.

The effect is that a large
number of students not pre-
viously eligible for Local Author-
ity grants now are; in many
cases, the grant will have to be
back-dated. These students will
then a u t o m a t i c a l l y become
home students, which will cause
great concern over quotes and
next year's admissions. The
colleges also have to find a large
sum of money to return these
students' fees—up to £10,000 per
student for a three year course—
and no college has easy access to
that kind of money. Imperial
College's budget this year is
officially described as 'tight',
F E L I X H H I B m
and it is by no means certain that
the Universities Grants Council
will supply the money. The
Registrar of the LSE (the college
most likely to suffer from this
ruling, and to the heart of the
University of London) told
F E L I X that neither the U G C
nor the University of London
had given much scope for
optimism.
A spokesman from Senate
House, the administrative centre
of the University of London,
told F E L I X that Senate House
has been in contact with the
U G C and DES, and a statement
from these bodies is expected by
the end of the month. In the
meantime, the Government will
U a n u a r y
be looking for ways to rewrite
the regulations for the award of
grants, but unless this can be
done without passing through
the House of Commons, it will
probably be left until after the
next General Election.
Imperial College Secretary
John Smith has published a
notice stating that no enquiries
can be answered on this subject
at present. Meanwhile, the
admissions procedure (normally
well underway by January) has
been thrown into confusion until
some policy has been reached on
the subject of next year's quotas.
An interesting feature of this
case is that although it was heard
in the summer, the judgement
1 4 , 1 9 8 3 B H H H H
•was not released until the end of j
the Christmas term. The grant
regulations say that Local Auth- j
orities are only under an obliga-
tion to make an award where a I
written application is received
before the end of the student's
first term at university.
The late publication of the
decision means that any student
who has not previously applied
for a grant will not be eligible. It
is strongly advised however that
all students who have not
applied should do so at once as
authorities have a discretion to
ignore this stipulation which, in
these extraordinary circum-
stances they may be minded—or
compelled—to do.
