1C vs U C 6-5
This was going to be a tough
match for IC lsts. A l l the
ingredients were there: violence
(courtesy of Dominic), depravity
(courtesy of Ian) and entropy
(courtesy of Tony). To cap it all
the team was understrength,
having to draft in two of the
second team players.
Despite all this IC played like
a spinach gourged team of
Popeyes. U C crumbled under
the p o w e r - p a c k e d hammer
blows dealt them by the rapier
like shots of IC. To put it in the
proverbial nutshell. Imperial
College won.
The match raises important
questions. Will Muppet M a n
and Geordie Steve ever regain
their places in the team? Would
honest Johns baldness have
dazzled the opposition? We'll
probably never know the ans-
wers.
A final comment would have
to be a resounding 'well done
chaps. You played hard, fought
hard and showed that IC bad-
minton will always win.'
Now down to the serious
business of the Badminton Club.
There will be a club dinner at
Lubas B i s t r o on Saturday
January 29 preceeded by and
followed by the partaking of
beverages in congenial sur-
roundings. See Chris for details.
Expected cost is about £7.00.
Marathon
I think by now that all people
accepted to run the London
Marathon have been notified.
Therefore I thought it might be a
nice idea to find out how many
IC students are running in the
event and to perhaps see how
they get on. So if you are going
to run in the marathon can you
drop the Sports Editor a note in
the F E L I X Office. A l s o if
anyone thinks it would be a
good idea to start organising
'runs' for people wishing to run
in the marathon then could they
let the Sports Editor know.

This rounds off a successful first
half of the season. League
matches continue next week so if
you're out of practice them get
in some fitness training this
weekend! This term a couple of
additional fixtures are planned,
including a weekend up to
Cambridge. Also on the calen-
dar is a club trip to watch the
final of the 3M British U-23
C h a m p i o n s h i p at W e m b l e y
Squash Centre in two weeks time
(Friday January 28). Tickets are
£6 and I need to know imme-
diately before no seats are left.
See Sportscentre for details.
The jerseys should arrive at
the end of the month. The
noticeboard displays the details
for anyone else interested.
Finally, the club now has the
use of one court on Sundays
from 8:00am until 12:30pm.
ACC
Just a quiet reminder to all
sports club captains. There will
be an A C C meeting on Tuesday
January 18 at 6:30pm in the
U n i o n L o w e r R e f e c t o r y .
A n o t h e r reminder to club
captains is that their estimates
for next year must be made by
the end of next week. Failure to
do this will firstly mean no
money for next year and secondly
Chinese water torture for the
captains concerned.
A reminder now to the A C C
Committee. There will be a
meeting today at 12:45pm. Do
not forget!!
