The parts of a modern aircraft that
have the highest value (in every
sense) are the ones you can't see.
Its avionics,
Avionics encompasses virtually every
aspect of an aircraft's operation.
Digital electronic flight control
systems transform a basically
unstable type into one that's safe
and predictable.
Terrain-following doppler radar
enables it to hug the ground even
at high speeds,
Advanced electro-optics, including
laser gyroscopes, help the pilot locate
his position with pinpoint accuracy.
The latest communications equipment
keeps it constantly in touch with
its base, and with other aircraft.
Weapons guidance systems help the
aircraft engage its target.
Electronic countermeasures prevent it
becomina one itself
It may surprise you that Britain, in
the shape of Marconi Avionics, is one
of the world's leaders in every
aspect of avionics.
To such an extent that we supply a
grp-^r range of avionics systems than
any other company m the world And
we supply them to some of the world's
toughest markets, including the U.S.
It may also surprise you that, as a
graduate in electronics, computer science,
physics or maths, you could be an
effective member of one of our project
teams within weeks of joining, at the
start of a learning curve whose steepness
you'll find exhilarating.
If that's an idea that appeals to you you
can find out more about our work, and your
