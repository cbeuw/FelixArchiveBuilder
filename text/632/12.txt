No Hex Please
Welcome back after the Christmas break. The
puzzle I have in mind this week is one which
I'm sure many of you will have found in your
crackers, but it's such a nice puzzle that I have
no qualms about bringing it to a wider
audience. It is simply this: cut out the seven
hexagons shown for, if you don't wish to
damage your copy of FELIX, trace them onto
a piece of card and cut them out) and try to fit
them into the following shape, such that
wherever two hexagons meet, the same
numbers come together. Good luck!

Last Week's Solutions
First, the non-prize puzzles.
A Word In Your Ear
Well, having given you six special words, I
managed to improve on three of them over the
holidays. Still, here are the reasons;
1. Almost-the longest common word in the
English language with the letters in strict
alphabetical order. Our illustrious leader,
Martin S Taylor, suggested 'Aegilops', a kind
of grass, but I hardly think that that's common.
2. Unconsciousness - Oh dear. This was
supposed to be the longest word which, when
written in lower case, has nothing projecting
above or below the main body of the word.
Unfortunately, the dot on the i provides a
squibble here. A better, equally long contender
is ouernervousness.
3 Bookkeeper - the longest string of double
letters in a word.
4. Wrong - it is. It was meant to be the
longest word with the letters coming in reverse
order, but it is defeated by wronged.
5. Facetious - the shortest word with all the
vowels in alphabetical order. Fine, but *y! >s
sometimes a vowel, so a better word is
facetiously.
S.Queueing - the word with the largest
number of consecutive vowels.
Dandelion Wine
Cucumber
Beef Broth
Egg
French Onion
Golden Pea
Asparagus
Haricot Bean
The Prize Puzzles
Scrnfcr's Soup Run
A wonderful puzzle this, from Perola. The
answer, for those of you patient enough to
work through it, is:
John's No. 1
Martin's No. 2
Andy's No. 2
Andy's No. 1
John's No. 2
Stephen's No. 1
Martin's No. 1
Stephen's No. 2
This provoked the only entry for any puzzle,
so a £5 cheque can be picked up from the
FELIX Office any time after 1:30pm on
Monday by Elizabeth Berry, a Physics PG.
Nobody has so far entered the other two
puzzles, so I'll run them both for one more
week.
Superkings - 2
Having had you puzzling over the rather
simple problem of placing a number of
superkings (pieces that can move like both a
queen and a knight) on a chess board. I shall
now reveal the more difficult part of that
question. All that I want you do do is find the
smallest n (n>l) such that n superkings can be
placed on an nxn board so that none attack
any other (although they may, for the purpose
of this puzzle, be collinear).

Perola's Puzzle
General Reisenschein's chiefs of staff have
had great difficulty arranging their offices and
their letters are always getting mixed up.
Heidensieck (head of Secret Service) does not
trust his comrades and so has ordered that all
his messages should be coded. However his
assistant Und Der Kuvher forgot to give him
the codebook so he's having trouble with the
test message. Can you help?

I shall give one more clue for the second
paragraph; leave ail the insignificant numbers.
