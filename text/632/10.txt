Wednesday
Firstly, I must apologise that What's On is so boring this
week. However, if I haven't got any pictures I can't print
them.
Secondly, we now have two What's On forms. One is
designed for regular weekly events, while the other is for one-
offs. Please ensure you use the correct form. In addition
could fill those societies that have previously been included
regularly please fill in a new form. Thanks.
