A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
a wellbeing hub might
not work for everyone, it
isn’t a be-all and end-all
solution. This concept of
physical spaces is dying
out quite quickly.
And furthermore, I can
see it damaging the
personal networks of
support students build
up in departments with
personal tutors and so on,
if there’s another ‘one-
stop shop’ that’s a bit
more faceless and general
in its presentation.
Talking of the multi-cam-
pus approach – as DPW,
how do you think that
might affect students and
the Imperial community
in years to come?
I think that the commu-
nities that provide people
the greatest sense of be-
longing tend to be smaller
local communities. So
my initial thought is that
it potentially has benefits
– you’re one student in
1000, rather than 10000.
It could help with that
isolation and loneliness
that a lot of students at
Imperial feel. By far the
communities that students
tell me they feel most
connected to are their
years, and also their clubs
and societies.
That’s where they may
be some issue – societies
either stay centralised
at South Kensington
and some students are
distanced from that, or
they fracture into cam-
pus-based ones and we
lose that collective. And,
as another issue, things
like the Union building
are currently firmly set in
South Kensington – that’s
not going anywhere.
Perhaps another Union
hub could be built at
another campus, but right
now it’s so hypothetical
and long-term that it’s
hard to pin down; I just
don’t think it’ll necessar-
ily be better or worse, just
different, and the most
important thing is that
students have a place to
feel they belong.
Felix: Speaking of
major projects – let’s
get back on track.
You’ve been work-
ing on rep training
recently?
Yes – especially over
the last couple of weeks.
We’ve just had our first
‘Rep Academy’, which
differs from how training
in previous years was
done. We’ve set aside
a day for it, with group
sessions and then split-
ting different sessions
for different groups of
reps depending on what
they need to know – e.g.
separate sessions for
wellbeing and academic
reps – and then everyone
coming back together
for a skills workshop. In
previous years, training
was done over several
evenings over the three
weeks post-elections.
This way, reps get a lot
more of a social aspect
to it, and everyone is in
the same room together
sharing ideas and contri-
butions. We put a lot of
effort into training reps,
and it’s very time-inten-
sive, but we do it because
of this – because their
insights are so valuable.
It’s pointless to elect reps
if we don’t equip them to
do the roles.
There does need to
be work done to keep
improving and under-
standing what reps need
from us, so we’ll be using
feedback. We also want to
be a lot more timely next
year – faculty and dep
reps are elected in March,
so waiting until October
to do training isn’t ideal.
And CU President training
needs to be looked at – we
don’t think including them
in two random days of
OT training is useful, but
waiting until October just
doesn’t work for them, as
they especially are really
in the thick of it from
August onwards. There’s
a really strong attitude
from this year’s OTs that
the Union is only as strong
as its volunteers – we’re
really trying to bring them
into decisions more and to
ensure they’re equipped to
do what they need to do.
Felix: And you’re also
looking at reforming
some of those roles –
specifically the Liber-
ation Officers?
Currently, the Liberation
Officers are very senior
roles in the Union – on par
with faculty reps and man-
agement chairs – but they
don’t fall into any other
structures. If anything
under their remit needs
to get done, it’s just on
them to do it. That means
both that if they can’t do
it alone, it doesn’t get
done, and that they aren’t
receiving support or inter-
linkage with others who
might want to help. That’s
just not good enough,
either for the rep or for the
students relying on their
Liberation Officers to be
able to do things.
In 2016-17, an external
company was brought in
to review liberation in the
Union, and they had some
great suggestions – many
of which haven’t yet been
implemented. I want to
look at it in a more holistic
way – what does it need to
succeed if we really want
to represent, campaign
for, build communities in
these groups. The kind of
incremental changes done
by my predecessors won’t
address this problem.
This is one area where
benchmarking against
other universities is really
helpful, so I’ve been
doing that, and it gave
me some ideas of where
we can go and how to
restructure. The desire for
change was really clear at
the first Community and
Welfare Board meeting
a couple of weeks ago,
and we gathered good
feedback. We’ll also look
to liaise with other groups
who may have a stake,
such as iQ or ACS.
I’m aiming for January as
a very ambitious deadline,
so that if there need to be
changes to the description
of the Liberation Officer
roles they’re ready for the
elections in Spring.
Felix: You also men-
tioned the Athena
Swan and Race
Equality Charter?
Both of these, the former
old and the latter rather
new, are essentially
‘awards’ given to higher
education institutions for
both their future plans
and their implementation
of past plans toward
making positive changes
for female and for BAME
students and academics.
It’s very much not just
about hitting some quota
of students, but rather
what the College is doing
to genuinely improve the
overall experience – every
single aspect.
I’ve been helping with
the applications – this
year, Imperial is seeking
to maintain its Silver
standard for the Athena
Swan, and to be accepted
for the Racial Equality
Charter as this is its first
year.
Felix: Why is the Col-
lege not aiming for
Gold?
In short, to be realistic.
Very very few institutions
have the Gold award, and
though there were dis-
cussions about it, it was
decided that we aren’t at
that point yet.
The Chemistry depart-
ment, however, is one of
only a few holders of a
departmental Gold Aware
in the country! It’s very
very prestigious.
Felix: What is your
involvement with the
applications?
I’m involved both in
working groups investi-
gating specific things for
the sake of the applica-
tions, as well as being part
of ‘self-assessment teams’
along with other Union
members like the Gender
Equality or BAME
Officers. We’ve been
running focus groups, but
the attendance has been
very poor – and we need
to dig into the reasons
behind that, because
maybe that’s emblematic
of a problem faced by
some students. Perhaps
many students aren’t
comfortable talking about
these things. For now,
we need to rethink how
students will be involved,
because we can’t pull
useful information out of
poorly-attended sessions.
Felix is recruiting!
