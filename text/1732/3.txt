T
he strikes, or-
ganised by the
United Voices
of the World
(UVW) trade union,
took place on Monday
28th, Tuesday 29th, and
Thursday 31st October,
with an estimated 200
staff joining at some
point over the three
days. There are plans
for further strike action
over the coming weeks,
for a total of fifteen days
throughout November
and December – critical
periods for the hospi-
tal’s operation.
The actions were
coordinated with strikes
from workers at other
London institutions, such
as the Ministry of Justice,
London’s Royal Parks,
the headquarters of ITV
and Channel 4, and the
Universities of Green-
wich and East London as
well as St. George’s Uni-
versity. This culminated
on Thursday with a joint
march between each loca-
tion, ending at St. Mary’s.
Imperial students have
been seen attending and
supporting the strikes
during the week, in a sign
of solidarity.
In 2017, UVW-or-
ganised action saw LSE
rescind its former contract
with Noonan, another out-
sourcing firm, and bring
their outsourced cleaners
in-house. This kickstart-
ed a miniature wave of
similar commitments
from other universities,
particularly in London –
but it doesn’t compare to
the overwhelming general
trend towards outsourc-
ing, with an almost 70%
rise in university spending
on outsourced workers
between 2010 and 2017.
Imperial College itself
is still contracted with
Noonan, though a College
spokesperson stated that
they are paid a living
wage. This is in direct
contrast with the workers
at St. Mary’s under the
Imperial College NHS
Trust, which is a separate
entity to the College but
has close links via aca-
demic research – and via
provision of both teaching
and clinical experience
for medics.
The complaints levied
at the Trust by the striking
workers are multiple, but a
key one is pay. Currently,
many are paid minimum
wage by Sodexo – just
£8.21 an hour – which is
significantly lower than
they would be paid if they
were in-house with the
NHS in the same roles.
Indeed, the lowest point
on the NHS pay scale is
£9.03 an hour. UVW says
that this creates a “two-tier
system” between in-house
and outsourced workers.
Practical considerations
of surviving in London on
low wages aside, several
said that they felt disre-
spected and undervalued:
“it just feels like we’re
considered ‘below’ the
pay scale – we aren’t
even worth being paid the
minimum they would pay
anyone.”
There are further
issues with sick pay. The
Sodexo-employed staff
are only given Statutory
sick pay – in other words,
only after being absent
for three unpaid days, and
then only up to £94.25
per week. Combined
with the low wage, this
has forced workers to
continue despite illness
– and despite the fact
that they’re working in a
hospital, in which many
patients are susceptible to
infection.
Additionally, many
workers claim they have
not been properly vac-
cinated – which is one
of their key demands.
Speaking to those at the
strike, this latter point
was raised often – there
for factors like wages and
sick pay based on how
many employees were
needed and the value of
the contract. He further
said that the Trust likely
decided to hire outsourced
(and mostly migrant)
workers instead of bring-
ing them in-house as a
money-saving bid.
This is despite the fact
that a report produced by
St. George’s University in
November 2016, after a
previous UVW in-housing
bid, showed that outsourc-
ing does not actually save
money total in the end. In
fact, bringing ‘soft facili-
ties management’ workers
in-house at St. George’s
would have saved up to
£200,000 a year. Despite
this, they still outsource
– and have staff who
participated in the strikes
this week.
The St. Mary’s strikes
are scheduled to continue
on the 11th to 13th and
25th to 28th of November,
followed by the 9th to
13th of December.
The strikers banding together outside St. Mary's // UVW
Imprial College NHS Trust Staff Strike
was a genuine feeling of
dedication to their work,
and chagrin at the idea
of having to endanger the
patients they work for in
order to survive them-
selves.
One striking cleaner
said, “I work 55 hours
a week just to cover my
rent. St. Mary’s is my
home, I spend more time
here than in my house. Yet
I am treated like a dog and
made to feel like dirt.”
There is a fundamental
problem with morale.
Working in a hospital is
always a tough job, espe-
cially in oft-overlooked
roles such as cleaning
or catering. A sense of
internal community is
important for surviving
the trials and tribulations.
However, the outsourced
staff are not included in
that – they are isolated and
alienated from in-house
workers, both in terms of
pay, but also in other more
direct ways.
They are, for example,
barred from using the
same canteens and
staffrooms. They also
claim that they are only
provided a mixed-gender,
mice-infested changing
room in the basement,
and are often only given
one or two uniforms by
Sodexo – meaning they
are forced to come to work
in unwashed clothes.
Sodexo, the firm to
which the Trust has out-
sourced these positions,
is a multinational corpo-
ration with a billion-euro
profit each year; the lack
of provisions is not due to
inability. It often amounts
to little more than mis-
treatment of migrant
workers – two staff who
spoke to Felix claim they
were told to “go home”, as
in to their own countries,
when bringing concerns
to Sodexo.
The minutes of the
Trust’s latest Trust Board
meeting on the 25th of
September – which was
after the strike was an-
nounced – do not mention
the action being taken, or
Sodexo staff in a related
context, implying it was
not discussed. In a press
release after the strike had
begun, they revealed that
they have firmly commit-
ted to ensuring their staff
receive the London Living
Wage, and will be renego-
tiating a new outsourcing
contract to begin in April
next year.
Additionally, the Trust
itself also published a
letter addressed to the
CEO of Sodexo on Thurs-
day 31st, which sought to
ensure issues would be
resolved, and stated:
“All of the staff who
work in our hospitals,
including all Sodexo
employees, are part of
one team and should be
treated as such, but you
have the primary respon-
sibility as their employer
to ensure their welfare
and to respond to their
concerns.”
Petros, one of the
key organisers of the St.
Mary’s strike, takes a dif-
ferent stance, and said that
the Trust needs to accept
responsibility along with
Sodexo. The outsourcing
contract signed between
the two would, he claims,
have specified parameters
