ethesda. A name
which, until re-
cently, brought
joy to many
people’s ears. On the 14th
November 2018, this all
changed; the release of
Fallout 76 was the begin-
ning of a year of seemingly
endless controversy. Why
are we bringing this up
again you ask? Well,
after all the issues which
have cropped up over the
last year (which will be
covered later) Bethesda
still haven’t seemed
to have learned their
lesson. Fallout 1st, a new
subscription service for
Fallout 76 is coming
for the price of £11.99 a
month! Wait….what?!
No – I am not joking.
To fully understand the
absolute absurdity of this
we must first understand
what went wrong with
Fallout 76. Although, a
better question is probably
what didn’t go wrong!
For starters, the premise
of the game already had
many early sceptics when
announced during E3
2018. It is an always-on-
line Fallout game with
no NPC’s and reliance on
player interaction. I think
most know all too well the
issue with always-online
games – trolls – so many
trolls. To make this even
worse there is a mechanic
in the game which allows
for the production of a
nuke. These nukes can
be fired on the map and
destroy someone’s base
they have spent HOURS
on.
The in-game controver-
sy was not even the worst
part. A special edition of
the game was available
for pre-order called the
‘Power Armour Edition’.
This edition was sold at
a steep $200, advertising
a canvas duffle bag as
one of its selling points.
The issue was that it did
not come with a canvas
bag and instead was a
cheap tacky nylon bag.
This instigated a barrage
of complaints from the
fanbase. At first, the
Bethesda support team
ignored the complaints
until they faltered and
said, “We aren’t planning
on doing anything about
it.” Clearly, this is not
how to handle accusations
of this nature, so eventu-
ally Bethesda relented;
however, the fanbase was
far from pleased. Players
“A new
subscription
service for
Fallout 76 is
coming for the
price of £11.99
a month”
“Both the
Fallout and
Fallout 76 sub-
Reddit’s are
riddled with
ESSAYS on
why Bethesda
needs to take a
step back”
upset about the swapped
bags were entitled to 500
atoms compensation. To
put this into perspective,
500 atoms is worth around
£5. That’s right!
It took until June the
following year (2019) for
Bethesda to start rolling
out the promised mer-
chandise, 7 months after
initially intended… poor
form Bethesda. But oh
boy does it get worse. In
December 2018 Bethesda
decided to ban 3 players
for supposedly cheating.
The players argued that
they were using mods but
not using them to cheat,
and as such, it became a
case of the player against
the developer with no
concrete evidence either
way. To put this to rest,
Bethesda told the players
they would be unbanned
if they each wrote an
essay on why cheating
is detrimental to online
games. This once beloved
companies’ solution to
potential cheaters was
to treat them like school
children; I honestly could
not make this up if I tried.
You would think after
that that they would learn,
but no! In April 2019
Bethesda started selling
Repair Kits in the Atom
Shop. A shop that uses
atoms as currency, which
as mentioned earlier is
purchased using real
money. Repair kits meas-
urably affect the game
and thus it took Bethesda
less than 6 months to
break their promise of
only cosmetic items being
available from the Atom
Shop.
Now this brings us
to this week, and oh
boy what a week it has
been for Bethesda. They
announced the release of
Fallout 1st, a subscrip-
tion service to Fallout
76 which costs £11.99 a
fast travel point; these
features arguably should
have been in the game
from the get-go. With
Fallout 1st the player also
gains 1,650 atoms per
month and access to the
Ranger Armour Outfit.
This goes to show how
badly Bethesda knows
its audience. The Ranger
Armour Outfit is from
Fallout: New Vegas, many
fans favourite game in the
franchise, (hilariously
not even developed by
Bethesda but instead
the original creators of
Fallout, Obsidian). Why
would they hide a fan
favourite item behind an
obscene paywall? The
only answer to all of this
is that Bethesda is getting
greedy and somehow has
gotten away with it until
now.
Luckily, players have
started to push back. One
man, David Chapman
from Indiana, purchased
the Fallout 1st domain
before Bethesda could
and riddled it with sa-
tirical explanations of
what is on offer, such as
“This sh***y community
has been begging for
the ability to play alone
in private worlds since
before the launch of
Fallout 76 (like what a
Fallout game should be),
and we begrudgingly
announce that they are
coming to the game with
Fallout F**K YOU 1st.”
Further push back
can be seen with players
in-game putting up
signs saying “Boycott
Bethesda”. Not only this
but both the Fallout and
Fallout 76 sub-Reddit’s
are riddled with ESSAYS
on why Bethesda needs
to take a step back and
re-evaluate themselves.
In an industry increas-
ingly surrounded by
bad business practices
(looking at you EA,
Ubisoft, Blizzard) you
cannot help but worry
what the future holds
when even once loved
Bethesda has joined the
ranks of trashy compa-
nies. Hopefully, all of
the backlash will send a
message, but one can only
hope.
Oh pip boy, what have they done to you! // Bethesda
