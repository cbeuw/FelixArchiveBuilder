Disaster struck last
week’s Sports Night
which culminated in the
resurrection of the Con-
servative and Unionist
Party Society.
Onlookers reported that
a group of IC Polo players
had gathered together to
see how much port they
could drink. After 60
bottles of W & J Graham’s
‘Ne Oublie’ Tawny Port
the group collapsed but
not before summoning
the spirit of the long
defunct Tory society. The
spirit rose up into the air,
laughing maniacally and
possessed the body of
Chomas Toss and his polo
cronies sending a burst of
power through the bar and
turning them into the new
Tory soc committee.
NegaFelix supernatural
correspondent M.Meg
commented “With that
much port and braying
they will have hit critical
mass early on. A single
‘How much does your
father earn again?’ was
probably enough to set the
whole process off”
What had begun for
many as a relaxed night
with friends became sud-
denly charged as every-
one’s trousers turned into
red chinos.
Witness to the scenes
in the bar Aran Faylward
said “It was really an-
noying. I spent hours at
home cutting the perfect
knee slits into my jeans
and all of a sudden I was
swamped in red cotton”.
However, the ex-Polo
soc members rallied the
whole bar, winning back
the support of the crowds
by drinking even more
port from their shoes and

gesting a shopping trip to
the King’s Road, follwed
by a table at Embargo’s
and the singing of songs
learnt on Gap years but
further debauchery was
halted by the arrival of the
Left Forum Torybuster
squad singing their theme
song. They didn’t have
any Torybusting Proton
packs due to austerity cuts
over the last nine years so
they resorted to throwing
coal instead. Unfortunate-
ly, like the miners’ unions
they were quickly crushed
under port-sodden suede
shoes.

that the society ran.
“I was expecting at least
some advice on getting
a job but the momment I
walked through the door I
was tarred, feathered and
mocked for needing to
even write a CV. Luckily
I still managed to grab a
couple of business cards
so I am not writing off the
whole experience”.
The 22s Tie Club have
complained to the Union
about an infringement
on their historic right to
be the most obnoxious
group at Imperial but were
reminded that as they
couldn’t officially exist
they had better suck it up.
