A Yorkshire Lad
This week, we feature a short piece by an Imperial alumnus about his experience at the College back in the day -
and how the friends made here will always be special

W
e were
p h y s i c s
f r e s h e r s
in 1956,
graduating in 1959. In
those days you could get
a double bed-sitter with
breakfast in upmarket
Cranliegh Gardens off the
old Brompton Road for
£7.50 a week each. You
could pick up lunch in
Queenies, a College res-
taurant, for 1/3 pennies,
which equates to 11p in
today’s money.
On graduating, after
a year in Hertfordshire
with English Electric, my
friend Dave went off - as
did most of my contem-
poraries - to California,
where he eventually
founded Altos Computers
and at one time employed
1600 people in a factory
that seemed me, when I
visited him, to be more
akin to a five-star hotel.
I instead stayed in East
London and took over the
family mechanical engi-
neering firm on the death
of my father in December
1959, at the age of 21. We
were both lucky to have
been presented with a
great opportunity at a time
when we were both able to
make the best of it: Dave
made on-board computers
for the American navy
and I made coin-slide
mechanisms when the UK
decimalised its currency.
In 2004 I met by chance
Lynda White who was the
senior mathematics tutor
at the College. She men-
tioned that she wanted a
few prizes to be sponsored
to encourage the students
and I was very pleased to
be in a position to help.
They’re called the Allen
prizes and are still offered
now.
But these prizes would
have been called the
Allen-Jackson prizes. My
friend Dave was sadly
killed in a mountain
cycling accident in 2001.
The group of his close
student friends sent him
off with a poem: “A
Yorkshire Lad”, which
I’m sharing with students
today.

A Yorkshire Lad
He came down from Yorkshire
When our lives were young,
He rang the bells and drank the beer
And kissed some fresh and eager lips
He came down from Yorkshire
When that old Queen’s world endured
To rush through dark, dank musty halls
And there to eat and talk for one and three.
He came down from Yorkshire
To hear the blessed wisdom of the West,
And sat enthralled and sometimes slept,
To comprehend some more the measured beauty of the world.
He came down from Yorkshire
To the sun-drenched land of promise
He built the boards and sold the dream,
And freed himself to live again
He went back to Yorkshire
To breathe once more that childhood air
He sailed beneath the black star sky
And knitted up the frayed ends of his life.
