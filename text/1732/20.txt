I
should start by saying
that I do enjoy Loyle
Carner’s music. It’s
just that since the
release of Not Waving,
But Drowning his musi-
cal formula has become
annoyingly apparent. The
guy has talent and lots
of people get something
from his music, but he
ain’t immune to criticism.
Now that I’ve completely
convinced you I’m not
a prick for writing this,
let me take you through
the six steps you need to
become your own mini
Carner.
Before step one you’re
going to need a stage
name. Loyle Carner’s real
name is Ben Coyle-Larn-
er. See what he did there?
So, my stage name would
be Ruthrie Guby. Alright
now let’s hit the studio.
1
- Every rap song
needs a beat, so
that’s where we’ll
start. Carner’s beats
reflect his “down to earth”
style/brand by using
acoustic instruments and
samples. A nice crisp
drum kit with a good high-
hat and rim click sound is
guaranteed to match more
than half of Carner’s dis-
cography. Maybe throw in
an open high-hat or vari-
ation on the kick drum,
but don’t make yourself
work too hard. On top
of your drums you’ll
need a catchy melody
“... all we have
to do is garner
a following of
millions and
produce a
collection of
songs...”
“Maybe throw
in an open
high-hat or
variation on
the kick drum,
but you don’t
want to make
yourself work
too hard.”
that can loop and not get
annoying. If you’re stuck
on which instrument to
choose then just pick the
first piano you see. If you
can’t play an instrument
don’t worry, you’re going
to need a friend like Tom
Misch eventually and I’m
sure they’ll be able to riff
something better than you
can.
2
- Now that you’ve
got something to
rap over it’s time
for you to show off
your vocals. The contents
of Carner’s verses are
diverse enough to make
them difficult to group
into one category, but his
choruses are a different
story. Write something
either two or four lines
long, the simpler the
better. The most important
part of this step is that you
must repeat what you
wrote twice. It’s impor-
tant that people are able
to sing along after just one
listen. Even if you have a
talented songwriter (e.g.
Jorja Smith) featuring on
your track you still need
to wedge in there with
a doubled-up simplistic
chorus.
3
- You’ve got the
catchiest parts of
the song sorted,
now you need
some substance for the
verses. Carner doesn’t
get worked up over a lot,
so your approach should
be as thoughtful and
considered as possible.
Present your chosen topic
in words that seem like
they’ve been inspired
by a conversation with a
therapist – a healthy way
of looking at it. The key
part of matching Carner’s
style is recreating his
timbre. The best way I can
describe it is “breakfast tea
rap”. Like a sleepier Rejjie
Snow or Mick Jenkins but
without talking about ass.
Reasonable tempo, no
sign of aggression/anger,
and low energy.
got a guardian we love and
cherish, but you’ll need to
turn that love up to eleven.
Carner loves his mum
like Kanye loves Kanye.
Jean (his mum) even has
her own track on Not
Waving, But Drowning; a
touching letter to her son.
Please don’t think I have
a problem with this step,
it’s actually my favourite
piece of his repetitive
nature. His love for Jean
is not a bad thing, it just
is a thing.

- Human connec-
tion is at the heart
of Carner’s albums,
and nothing
screams human connec-
tion more than a collection
of secretly recorded voice
memos. In Not Waving,
But Drowning Carner had
recordings of chilling in
the studio, the World Cup,
talking to a cab driver,
etc. Once you’ve got your
memos, pick four or five
and wedge them in there
at seemingly random
moments.
6
- Lastly, you’ve got
to get the “uh”s.
The “uh” is a staple
of the Carner style.
Got a moment in a track
that feels like it’s missing
something? Just exhale
shortly and make a vague
noise. For some reason
this is the one that bugs
me the most, probably
the reason I decided to
write this. I’ve combed
the lyrics, crunched the
numbers, and mathemat-
ically proven that from
debut to second album
Carner has become more
repetitive. There was an
overall increase in “uhs”
of 134% from album 1 to
album 2, with a track by
track increase of 155%.
In album 2 there was an
average of one “uh” every
26 seconds. I could pull
up my working or make a
chart, but you likely start-
ed reading this to escape
using your brain.
Phew it’s all done, and
look at us, just a couple
of Carners. That was the
hard part. With our toolkit
formula perfected we’ll
soon be topping Carner
himself. Now, all we have
to do is garner a following
of millions and produce a
collection of songs with
millions of streams.
