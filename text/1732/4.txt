T
he Autumn
elections ended
on Thursday
24th October,
with 329 student reps
elected. Felix breaks
down the data with the
help of the Union Elec-
tions Team, and spoke to
them about what made
turnout so excellent this
year.
To break down the data:
the total turnout emerged
at 34.31%, corresponding
to over 7000 voters for the
first time ever – a large
improvement in a short
time, given that last year
was the first time 6000
voters had been reached.
The record was set for
both undergraduate and
postgraduate involvement
– especially undergrad-
uate, with a 5% increase
over last year – and sits
significantly above the
average turnout for UK
universities.
There’s a sense of
competition at Imperial,
between faculties and
departments – so let’s take
a look at the best of each
for turning out.
The Faculty of Engi-
neering blew the compe-
tition away with a whop-
ping 40.0% turnout, with
the Faculty of Natural
Sciences falling behind
at only 36.6%. Both,
however, are carrying
casting their vote for
undergraduate representa-
tive – closely followed by
Engineering again. The
lowest turnout was 9.04%
for postgraduate Medicine
rep!
The position with
the highest turnout was,
contrary to the norm, a
postgraduate rep – spe-
cifically, for the Electrical
and Electronic Engineer-
ing: MSc Control Systems
academic representative.
24 out of 27 voters for the
role turned out, leaving a
truly impressive 88.89%
turnout. There were five
more rep positions with
a turnout above 80%,
and another eight above
70% - all of whom more
than double the overall
average!
Departmentally, there
were six that broke Engi-
neering’s record, passing
40% overall turnout.
The highest were Earth
Science and Engineering,
with 45.11% turnout,
followed very closely by
Bioengineering at 45.01%
- with amounts to just a
couple of students extra!
As a fun fact: the most
hotly contested role was
for International Officer,
which had almost 30
candidates and went
over 20 rounds using the
Single Transferrable Vote
system!
Felix spoke to Keriann
Lee, Head of Student
Voice and Communica-
tions, about who works
on elections and how they
generated more engage-
ment than ever before.
Elections are run by the
Elections Working Group,
which is led by Keriann
and features a cross-sec-
tion of staff from various
teams. This includes
representatives from
the Systems team, who
manage the custom voting
system and built the new
complaints solution;
from Representation and
Activities, who ensure all
relevant positions are in-
cluded; and the Marketing
team, who raise awareness
across the College. There
are then two DROs, who
interpret the rules during
the election cycle. It is
important to note that no
elected positions (such as
the Union President and
Deputy Presidents) are
allowed to participate, to
avoid risks of conflict of
interest, though students
are consulted via the Gov-
ernance Committee – who
oversee timelines and
have general oversight –
and the Union Council,
who determine the by-
laws.
The collection of this
group of interdisciplinary
people requires a tight-
ly-managed effort to pull
together – and this year,
they made several changes
to increase participation.
As Keriann said:
“There have been a
number of improvements
to our elections over
the past year and a half.
We have tighter project
management with dates
for each poll set well in
advance and laser-like
focus of the project team
several weeks ahead
of the event; we have
streamlined our com-
plaints procedure to make
it both easier to use from
a student standpoint, but
also easier to manage in-
ternally, with non-student
facing managers serving
as DROs and a separate
staff member handling
queries specifically.”
With regards to turnout,
there have also been more
direct changes. “We now
spend more time during
the nominations process
ensuring that students
understand the roles, why
they are important, and
what the commitment is.
This, coupled with greater
multi-campus promotion,
tends to lead to a stronger
field of candidates and a
greater appreciation for
the role of Reps to the
overall student experience
at Imperial. The result is
greater investment in the
election outcomes, strong-
er student campaigns, and
ultimately higher turnout.
Better segmenting of our
communications is also
key.”
Record Turnout at Autumn Elections
The elections this year topped the charts in terms of turnout for Autumn, cresting 34% - Felix breaks down the
stats and speaks to the Elections team
“The Faculty
of Engineering
blew the
competition
away with a
whopping
40.0%
turnout”
their counterparts with
results above the overall
average of 34.31% – with
the lowest faculty being
the “IC” faculty repre-
senting students outside
of the four that encompass
most courses, reaching
only 19.6%.
Science, however, took
revenge and won out with
regards to Council Rep
turnouts, with 24.54%
“Coupled
with greater
multi-campus
promotion,
w got a
stronger field
of candidates
and a greater
appreciation
of Reps'
contribution"
Felix is recruiting!
