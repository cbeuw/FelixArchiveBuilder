Pizza Union: The Cheapest Pizza You’ll Find in
London!
FOOD
Zahra Deji-Abiola
Food Editor
I
’m going to let you in
on one of London’s
better kept secrets.
Pizza Union. They
don’t even need a gim-
mick. This pizza place
has 12” pizzas starting at
£3.50. No coupon code.
No Instagram exclusive.
No witch making you
promise your first-born
child in exchange for
some genuinely afforda-
ble food in London.
That is genuinely what
their margherita will set
you back by. And this is
legit. This isn’t a case of
sneaky advertising or a
loss leading campaign.
The average price on the
pizza menu is £5.50 with
the highest price on there
being £6.50. And yes,
I did the math. I am an
Imperial student after all.
These thin crust, Italian
style pizzas are really that
cheap. There is no doubt
that eating here will save
you some dough. Sorry,
couldn’t resist a cheesy
pun. Okay I’ll stop now.
Back to the food.
Even with these prices,
Pizza Union still manages
to only cut slices and
not corners. (Yes, I lied,
I still had one more in
me.) They aren’t stingy
with their toppings. The
herbs on the pizzas we
got were front and centre
when it came to flavour.
The peppers and onions
were sweet and juicy.
Everything on our plates
looked and (most impor-
tantly) tasted fresh. If you
want, you can watch the
whole thing be made from
scratch in front of you in
their massive stone oven.
They rather impres-
sively manage to incorpo-
rate the huge device into
their aesthetic for their
restaurants. It works as a
spectacle but doesn’t stick
out like a sore thumb.
Speaking of their aesthet-
ic, they do seem to love
their pink. From the menus
to the plates - pretty much
everything there uses pink
as the accent colour. And
sometimes not just pink -
neon pink. Against their
bare brick walls, you can
find neon signs plastered
tastefully around the
building. Really fun to
sit under when its dark
outside. I have your next
Instagram post sorted.
You’re welcome. They
have the overdone hipster
fake-run-down aesthetic
going on with half painted
walls and peeling wallpa-
pers that I couldn’t help
but roll my eyes at. Still
the wood tables and stool
make for a really casual
dining experience.
I’ll save you all the
embarrassment I had to
endure when I first went
in and had no idea how
to actually order my food
as it was news to me.
They really commit to
the laid-back aesthetic by
having you do most of the
service. You go up and
make your order at the till
and leave with anything
you can get right away a
buzzer with their logo on
it. And yes, it is pink. Find
yourself somewhere to sit
and relax until your buzzer
goes off, indicating the
completion of your freshly
cooked pie. Go over to
their pickup station and
exchange your buzzer for
your masterpiece.
is something I find that
many pizza joints struggle
with. The crust ended up
rather burnt and hard in
a few spots though. The
mozzarella on our pies
were melted to perfection.
To keep it real with you,
these pizzas are really
thin so if you are looking
for a carb galore, you’ll
have to find another spot.
The savings don’t stop at
the pizzas. Their cocktails
start at £3 and they’ve got
a great gelato selection
that you should ask about
after if you find space for
something sweet after
your meal.
You can find them in
King’s Cross, Aldgate,
Dalston and Spitalfields.
Watch out for their new
spot in Hoxton opening
soon. If your London
geography is any good
you will realise that
none of these stores are
particularly close to South
Kensington. Not close
at all actually. They all
managed to be in either
north of west London. I
know - it’s not fair. It’s
what we get for being
situated in one of the
most expensive areas in
London. The effort to get
to one of these places and
back is probably making
you second guess this
entire review but think
about it this way. You can
take this as an opportunity
to leave your troubles
behind on campus and
explore London. The
British Library is a great
change of pace from
Central Library. Reward
yourself during the study
breaks and you can pop
over to the King’s Cross
branch to grab a slice or
two. You can even see
what’s on at the Wellcome
Collection while you’re
in the area. Work up
an appetite visiting the
iconic attractions around
Southwark before heading
down to the one in
Aldgate to finish it off. To
me there is no better thing
to make plans around than
food. London is a treasure
trove of great food stops
that can lead to some even
better memories if you let
it.
