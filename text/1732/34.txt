ryptocurrencies
are digital
assets which are
intended to be
used as a medium of
exchange. Traditionally,
the supply currency can
be controlled by a central
bank or the government,
however this is not the
case with cryptocurren-
cies. Within this system,
What are cryptocurrencies and what is happening in
identity of its users.
This results in difﬁcul-
ty tracking transactions
compared to traditional
banks where transactions
can easily be tracked.
With Blockchain, trans-
actions can be performed
with minimal fees using
private and public keys
as opposed to steeper fees
often charged by tradition-
al ﬁnancial institutions.
In addition, Blockchain
makes cryptocurrencies
virtually impossible to
manipulate as transac-
tional data would require
altering the data of the
previous block, requiring
the support of multiple
users.
Therefore, cryptocur-
rencies are considered to
be decentralised, meaning
there is no central bank,
authority or institution
tasked with regulating the
currency and verifying
the transactions. The
difﬁculty in tracking
transactions with crypto-
currencies have resulted
in it being widely used in
online black markets or
other nefarious activities,
most notably through
Silk Road which was an
online market used for
adopt blockchain-based
cryptocurrencies and
plans to develop its own
digital renminbi (RMB).
This comes as no
surprise since mobile
payments are widely used
and accepted in China
where both Alipay and
Tencent are widely used.
This system makes use
of a unique QR code to
carry out transactions.
However, in many
Western countries, the use
of physical money is still
the standard. In China,
there is an estimated 45%
of the population using
mobile payments however
in the UK, France and
Germany this is only
16.9% , 13.7% and 11%
respectively. It is clear that
other countries are at dif-
ferent stages of accepting
the use of technology as a
safe and viable platform
to make purchases, let
alone adopting decentral-
ised cryptocurrencies. In
recent years, a US-based
start-up called Flexa
created a payment app
which made it easier for
consumers and sellers
to trade using crypto-
currencies including
Bitcoin, Ethereum and
the Gemini dollar. This
was expected to serve up
to 30,000 stores including
retailers apprehensive to
make a move to crypto-
currencies.
In the news
On the 18th of June
2019, Facebook publicly
announced that they
are working on Libra, a
cryptocurrency, with 28
partnering companies.
Facebook launched this
project to produce a global
cryptocurrency payment
system which was safe,
reliable and easy to use.
But growing concerns
regarding Facebook’s
recent scandals regarding
selling drugs. Global gov-
ernments have responded
differently to cryptocur-
rencies; for example in
the West, many leaders
in governments and the
ﬁnance sector have criti-
cized its use. This includes
John Bogle, founder of
asset-management ﬁrm
Vanguard Group, who
warned investors to “avoid
Bitcoin like the plaque’’.
Famed investor Warren
Buffet has described
Bitcoin as “probably
rat poison squared” and
a “delusion”. However,
in the East, President
Xi Jinping has contro-
versially gone against
the grain and is actively
campaigning for China to
seize the opportunity to

the safety solely lies in
the hands of parties called
miners. These people use
Cambridge Analytica and
the way in which they
handle users’ data has led
to extreme push back by
regulators and authority
ﬁgures. Amid ongoing
scrutiny, a quarter of part-
nering companies have
walked out on the project.
Notably, PayPal left the
partnership on the 4th of
October and this triggered
several companies to
leave the partnership the
following week. This begs
the question; will we now
ever accept cryptocurren-
cies?
their computers to help
verify and timestamp
transactions hence adding
them to a record in ac-
cordance with a particular
timestamping scheme. In
exchange, these miners
earn fees in a form of
cryptocurrencies and at
the same time they bear
the costs of the machines,
cooling systems and
electricity.
Consequently, this
forms a blockchain, which
is a continuously growing
list of records called
“blocks” that are linked
and secured using cryp-
tography. For example,
Bitcoin uses SHA-256
to link its blocks, a cryp-
tographic hash function
for their proof-of-work
scheme.Namecoinutilises
a domain name system,
while Litecoin was the
ﬁrst to use a script as its
hash function which acts
as a password-based key
derivation function. Each
block usually has a hash
pointer which connects to
the previous block which
also has a timestamp and
transaction data. There-
fore, these peer-to-peer
network transactions are
recorded permanently

at the same time, the
value of these currencies
has been very volatile;
between December the
15th and the 22nd 2017,
Bitcoin dropped in value
by £3463.6, representing
a 23.4% decrease. Con-
sequently, it is clear why
retailers are not keen on
accepting them as a form
of payment and investors
are proclaiming it to be
the next big bubble. With
these statements from
public ﬁgures allied with
unpredictable events, it
