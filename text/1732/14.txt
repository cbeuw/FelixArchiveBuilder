Great Expectations
M
y week
began this
M o n d a y
with Great
Expectations. I was richly
rewarded by a play that
was wonderfully acted and
brought to life the world
of Pip, Miss Havisham
and Magwitch.
For those of you un-
familiar with the plot, it
follows the life of Pip, an
adopted blacksmith’s son.
Pip, whilst mourning for
his dead parents, meets
rious benefactor with the
announcement that he has
Great Expectations. The
plot unfolds from there:
those with any interest
should watch this play. It
was fantastic.
In his journey Pip,
played by Joseph Payne,
meets a colourful assort-
ment of Dickensian char-
acters that each member of
the cast captures perfectly.
Jamie Foulkes is the sim-
pering Mr Pumblechook,
Alice Franziska is the
cold and cruel Estella and
Guy Clark presents what
I can only describe as the
most lawyerly lawyer I
have ever seen on stage or
screen. The cast portrayed
each caricature perfectly
intrueDickensianfashion.
Each member of the cast
worked to capture the
excitement and mystery
of the plot capturing the
audience in the world of
Victorian London, now
the sinister dark marshes,
now Miss Havisham’s
decrepit abode.
The set was very
minimal, the staging
unusual. The stage was
in a narrow, long corridor
between two stands.
The proximity of the
audience to the action
gave the production an
intimate air which helped
with imagining the space
as it transformed from
street to graveyard. Miss
Havisham was granted an
elaborate wheelchair in
which Ibirogba-Olulode
slumped imperiously. The
cast, when Pip was lost in
reverie, whispered from
the darkness of the end
as an atmospheric chorus,
perfectly rehearsed and
I
had always assumed
that ‘gaslighting’, a
form of psychological
manipulation which
systematically breaks
down another person’s
grip on reality, was a very
modern phenomenon.
Imagine my surprise
when I found out that its
etymology derives from
a play first written in
1938. Gaslight tells the
story of a woman, Bella,
who is being persuaded
she is quite mad by her
husband, Jack. He hides
her possessions, plays
sadistic tricks on her and
continually threatens her
with violence or the mad-
house. Mysteriously, she
also hears footsteps on the
forbidden top floor of the
house through the ceiling.
will be consist of Bella
being slowly driven out
of her mind. I’m all for
deeply moving theatre,
but two hours of this sad
fate does not sound like
an appealing prospect,
especially as I’ve brought
my companion here for
her birthday. It brings to
mind that one time when
I watched 12 Years A
Slave for my friend’s 15th
birthday, which was just
as uplifting and joyful as
you could imagine.
Fortunately, and almost
entirely out of the blue, a
dashing police detective,
played by the excellent
Joe McArdle, shows up
to save Bella from her
terrible spouse. It turns out
that Jack is an infamous
murderer that has shown
up back at the scene of the
crime to recover valuable
gems he never found in
the initial slash and grab.
The eponymous gas lights
fade whenever he ascends
to the top floor to search.
Horror ensues! Mostly at
the faintly ridiculous, but
as I will begrudgingly
admit, rather clever plot.
This particular produc-
tion of Gaslight laboured
somewhat. In the words
of my companion, ‘I was
bored until the detective
showed up’. The dialogue
was sometimes slow and
meandering. Jordan Wal-
lace’s characterisation of
Jack could do with a little
more sinister intent and
Jemima Murphy, as Bella,
could use a smidgeon
more confused lovesick-
ness. Nonetheless, the
play really got going once
the detective appeared on
the scene. Striding around
on stage, eliciting laughs
from the crowd, McArdle
proved to be a wonderful-
ly energetic addition to
the production.
One factor that they
overemphasised was
its inclusion.
Overall, the play was
a good watch. The clever
use of lighting for the
flickering gas lamps, the
thrill of the hunt for the
treasure and of course, the
triumph over the wicked
husband by the noble
force of the law made for
a pleasant conclusion. Un-
fortunately, real cases of
gaslighting do not follow
such a course. In a world
where people are slowly
waking up to the realities
of such subtle abuse in
the domestic sphere, how
relevant is it to have a
play where the good guys
always win?
