VQ: The Restaurant that Never Sleeps
FOOD

W
e all know
how it goes.
The night
starts out
with good intentions.
You’ve handed in your
coursework with just 2
minutes to spare. You
want some fun. You round
up your friends and dance
the stress away while
screaming Beyoncé lyrics
at the top of your lungs,
having the time of your
life as a student in one
of the best cities in the
world. That lasts like 10
minutes. Then someone
gets kicked out, someone
else disappears and ends
up in the other side of
London all while you are
making bad decision on
the dance floor with your
ex. Only one thing can fix
a night like this. Food.
McDonalds is the place
of choice for students
when it comes to that.
You know what you are
in for and they have many
locations that are open
late at night. Then there
are the kebab and chicken
shops conveniently placed
close to the club with rea-
sonable yet slightly higher
prices than they should
be. They haven’t done
us wrong yet. And yet, I
still I think we deserve
more. We deserve space
and comfort while we eat
as much food as we can
get our hands on. That’s
where VQ comes in. They
are a chain of 24 hours
restaurants (with a few
pesky outliers) that are
willing to accommodate
the tired and tipsy that
stumble in through the
night with never ending
breakfast. We gave them
a visit sober to see if they
deserve to see us at our
worst.
To start, we had their
chicken and waffles.
An American southern
classic with enough
grease and sugar to lull
any drunk to serenity. It
came as 3 boneless fried
chicken pieces on top of 1
waffle which was a weird
ratio. The chickens could
barely fit and it would
have plated much better
to have a second waffle.
Nevertheless, the taste did
not disappoint. I found
that the breading was
well seasoned and paired
perfectly with the intense
sweetness of the waffle.
Having the fillets dipped
in their maple syrup was
a religious experience.
It’s a shame that that this
isn’t part of their breakfast
menu because this would
definitely get me going in
the morning.
We still needed to try
“Having the
fillets dipped

syrup was
a religious
experience”
out another comfort food
for eating the humiliation
of the night away, so we
got the apple crumble.
This was another sugary
treat and with some
custard in a bowl to the
side. The custard was
without a doubt the
highlight of the dish with
the smooth, golden liquid
warmed us up from the
inside out. The size of
the bowls made it hard
to incorporate the two
treats with each other – a
problem that only be
heightened in a drunken
state – but that’s what you
have the sober friend for.
Outside of their comfort
food we needed to also
trial the establishment as
an actual restaurant. Their
smoked salmon taglia-
telle looked and smelled
amazing, with enough
salmon to ease the wound
to our bank accounts, but
there just wasn’t enough
cream sauce. Due to this,
the whole thing just ended
up being dry even though
the taste did, otherwise,
deliver.
Now I’m not going to
lie to you. Some of the
prices had our student
wallets shaking in their
overdrafts. But that’s why
this place is different. It’s
not for when you bought
one too many rounds at
the bar and are worried
about how you are going
to afford the uber home let
alone your post-club meal.
It’s for when you need to
bad decisions, you can
feel above it too.
From Aldgate to
Bloomsbury to Clapham,
they have restaurant all
over London, so you are
bound to pass one on your
way back home. There
is even one in Fulham
(where they started out)
that is open 24 hours and
has a 24-hour alcohol
licence if you want to
keep the party going for
some inane reason. Their
breakfast menu is always
available so you can have
your full English at 4 am
while wondering how you
ended up in this situation
with some semblance of a
functionality surrounding
you.

for when you
bought one
too many
rounds - it’s to

night””
be waited on after having
to run after your crazy
friends all night. Like they
say, you are what you eat.
So maybe – just maybe
– if you eat above your
actual mood of regret and
Enough salmon to sate the appetite, but lacking in the crucial sauce! // Zahra Abiola
