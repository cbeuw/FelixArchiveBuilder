Understanding the 2019 Canadian Election

L
ast week Justin
Trudeau man-
aged to claw his
way to a minority
government in an election
which saw him lose his
2015 sweeping majority
and came after a term that
had few clear wins and
was marred by contro-
versy. There was a clear
regional divide in election
results, with a complete
loss of Liberal (Trudeau’s
party) seats in the Western
provinces of Alberta and
Saskatchewan (dubbed
‘wexit’) and a surge in
Bloc Quebecois (a Quebec
independence party)
support, with the party
attaining 30 seats from 10
in 2015 and supplanting
the NDP as the secondary
opposition in parliament.
As the second largest
country in the World,
Canada naturally has
a diverse and fairly
disparate electorate. For
example, the Greater
Toronto area (GTA),
where 18.81% of the
population of Canada live
has 43 ridings (the equiv-
alent of constituencies)
whereas the 2.1 million
sq km Arctic territory of
Nunavut only has one.
This naturally means that
metropolitan areas have
the largest amount of clout
in the federal elections
due to increased popu-
lation density. Trudeau’s
liberal party gained all
but three ridings in the
GTA - whilst historically a
local majority of this scale
would have gained him a
federal win, the gains of
Bloc Quebecois and the
Conservatives prevented
a majority.
The needs of the
Canadian electorate as
a whole are incredibly
diverse, a product of
a multitude of factors
including geography,
industry and the history
of the province and its
people. Those in Nunavut
are at the forefront of the
effects of climate change,
and have an extortionately
high cost of living. Blue
collar workers in the
western provinces where
Trudeau performed so
poorly view environmen-
tal policy as squandering
the plentiful oil sands and
resources of the country,
at the expense of their
jobs (this animosity links
back to Trudeau’s father,
who in 1973 asked prov-
inces to freeze oil prices,
making them unable
to sell higher prices).
First Nations Canadians
(indigenous Canadians)
contend with a lack of
action following the
investigation into missing
and murdered indigenous
women that resulted in the
investigating commission
calling the increased rate
of homicide of indige-
nous women tantamount
to genocide. Trudeau
mandated the missing and
murdered women inquiry,
but has done little to act
wider World. The produc-
tion of the pipeline also
places Trudeau in further
contempt with the First
Nations community, who
would be posed to lose
out significantly in terms
of land and disruption in
its construction, a further
blow to Trudeau’s creden-
tials and promises to
So what of the Bloc
Quebecois surge? Quebec
is a province that is
traditionally subject to a
large amount of swing,
however the extent of the
Bloc victory was amongst
the biggest surprises of
the election. The province
has a degree of diplomatic
representation, with
offices in various coun-
tries and separate rep-
resentation in Canadian
delegations. In 1995 a
referendum on Quebec
having a sovereignty
agreement (a step below
outright independence)
was narrowly defeated,
the culmination of years
of constitutional conflict.
Whether the bloc surge
indicates increased public
desire for independence is
unclear - the main cities of
Quebec City and Montreal
remained Conservative
and Liberal respectively,
and given that many seats
were gained from the
NDP, whose stake in the
province has been dwin-
dling for the past 3 federal
elections, the gains may be
more complicated. Recent
polls suggest that 82% of
quebecers believe that the
province should remain
in Canada, and the Bloc
campaigned primarily on
environmental and other
issues unrelated to sepa-
ratism. So all indicators
suggest there won’t be a
secession anytime soon.
This election is also
the first since a landmark
supreme court ruling
earlier this year that
allows all Canadian
citizens abroad who were
“There is
a complex
balance to
be made in a
country that is
simultaneous-
ly rich in fossil
fuels and
melting polar
ice caps“
previously resident in the
country to vote in their old
riding, no matter how long
they have lived away from
Canada. Given that there
are ~3 million Canadian
citizens abroad, this could
potentially represent a
large minority of the
electorate. However the
impact of this ruling is not
yet and not set to be clear,
as expats are not grouped
as a voting bloc, and the
Canadian government has
not published any data

on the number of expat

In short, no Canadian
Prime Minister can win
over everyone - there is
a complex balance to be
made in a country that
is simultaneously rich in
fossil fuels and melting
polar ice caps, and is
marred by the legacy and
artefacts of colonialism,
from the state mandated
cultural genocide of native
peoples to the continuing
battle for Quebec inde-
pendence. Trudeau has
thus far been lacklustre
in majority government,
and his reelection has
produced a country polit-
ically divided. Let’s see
what he can do in the next
term.
“If not built, Alberta is forecast
to go into a recession...
however building a trans-
national pipeline is counter to
the environmentalist image
Trudeau wishes to portray
on the 231 ‘imperative
changes’ it concluded
with. The use of the term
genocide has also proved
contentious for Trudeau,
who declined to endorse
that aspect of the report,
yet used the term in a
speech to describe the
issue.
The production of
the TMX oil pipeline is
demonstrative of many
of the geographical and
cultural conflicts in
Canadian politics. If it is
not built, the province of
Alberta (which already
has unemployment above
the national average) is
forecast to go into reces-
sion. However building
a trans-national pipeline
is counter to the environ-
mentalist image Trudeau
wishes to portray to those
in metropolitan areas
such as Montreal and
Vancouver, as well as the
