Halloween!
love Halloween.
It's always been my
favourite holiday of
the year - a night of
scary stories, creepy
crawlies, screams and
movies and sweets and
candy. There's nothing not
to love about it.
See, it feels very differ-
ent from other holidays.
Yes, it suffers from the
same gradual suffusion of
corporate nonsense - yes,
Halloween decorations
go up earlier every single
year in a morally bankrupt
attempt to capitalise on
happiness and excitement.
God Bless Neoliberalism.
However, it doesn't
quite suffer the same
cheesiness as other hol-
idays. Or rather, plenty
of cheese abounds, but it
hasn't quite seeped into the
public perception of the
holiday yet. I still associ-
ate Halloween with some
of its traditional values,
with a time for ghosts
and ghouls, rather than
the ruin that is my cynical
adult view of holidays
like Christmas - which are
only good because I get a
day off and can drink with
my lovely family at 9am
without feeling quite as
guilty.
Halloween still feels
spooky, the way it's meant
to be. They haven't robbed
us of that yet, no matter
how much of a superficial
veneer of marketing good-
ness they smear over the
top. I still look over my
shoulder on Halloween,
late at night on the streets
with my breath puffing
into mist before me. I still
sleep a little bit less easy
that night - and I relish it.
Weirdly, I developed
this love without ever
trick-or-treating much as
a kid. I dressed up some-
times - my mum is just the
most fantastic face-paint-
er, although unfortunately
I inherited little of her ar-
tistic talent. But only once
or twice did I partake in
the tradition that for many
people defines the identity
of Halloween from their
childhood. The one time
I tried in the small village
I grew up in, I ended up
knocking at the door of a
man who had had recently
had a stroke - who came,
and answered kindly in a
rusty voice that he'd had
a stroke and didn't have
anything for me. I didn't
understand at the time,
but my mum's reaction
and apology made it
clear - I felt chagrined to
have bothered someone
going through a hard
time. Maybe that spoiled
it a bit for me - my first
experience being the
knowledge that whenever
you have fun, someone
else is suffering horribly
somewhere.
No, Halloween became
special to me after I
moved to Edinburgh. My
experiences in Scotland
are a topic for another
Editorial, but this one I'm
cracking out now - The
Samhain Festival.
My family took me
one year - I must have
been only around 12.
We walked up the hill
to the Royal Mile, the
cobbled ancient street
descending down from
the castle to Holyrood.
It's full of old Victorian
tenements, cathedrals, the
ancient stone of the castle
itself. It positively reeks
of history, of Burke and
Hare, of the grisly plagues
and dirty streets of times
past - especially late at
night. Edinburgh's ghost
tours almost always start
from the Royal Mile, and
Mary King's Close - the
famous twisting alley
where plague victims
were blocked off to die -
lies just off to the side.
Outside of St. Giles'
Cathedral, there's a square
(on which, for reference,
lies the Heart of Midlo-
thian - a spot for public
execution in years past.)
There, people gathered.
Back then, it was many,
but still a small boy like
me could see. We waited,
chatting in the cold, and
through the fog they came.
Automations, almost - but
no, they were stilt walkers,
wearing costumes such as
I had never seen - ones
that genuinely seemed
creepy, unnerving, rather
than the plastic I wore
strapped to my face. I was
mesmerised. There was
fire, there was everything.
Honestly, I don't recall
much detail - it was an
experience, and one that
made me realise the af-
finity for the appalling I
feel I sometimes have. I'm
drawn to the creepiness.
Maybe that's why I was
such an emo teenager.
I left feeling very dif-
ferent about the night - no
longer caring for the idea
of trick-or-treating, but
rather determined to come
back to that festival every
year. It held something
pure, something crystal-
line, something dark and
morbid and attractive
in that. It felt as ancient
as those cobbled stones,
along which those stilt
walkers moved with such
grace. It imprinted a love
in me that will last for the
rest of my life.
Now I live in London,
and I haven't checked
to see about equivalent
events here. I wasted my
Halloweens in my degree
years getting drunk at
mediocre parties. In my
first year, I escorted an
unknown IC student
from Fabric to Waterloo
because he was too drunk
to stand, after having been
pickpocketed, and then
had to walk home to South
Kensington - having only
been in London a month.
Admittedly, that was a bit
of a treat, though perhaps
a little too real for comfort.
This year, I'm working on
Halloween - indeed, I'm
writing this Editorial on
the night itself, letting that
sensation steal over me
and looking forward to
the deliciously unnerving
train ride home. But also,
there's something just
special about Edinburgh,
about Samhain. I don't
want to shatter that crys-
talline impression I have,
that defined my favourite
holiday forevermore.
