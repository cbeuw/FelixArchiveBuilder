a moment by which he
remembers his stint in
active service.
For me, this was during
the last night of my
final multi-day training
exercise. A combat march
that was planned to last 2
hours in the pitch darkness
of the night dragged on
for longer. Low on rations
and water, each man
burdened with gear, my
company perched atop a
hill. We watched the sun
rise over the objective we
were assigned to capture.
A raid that was planned to
occur in the night became
a daylight assault. Impro-
vising as we must, even-
tually we achieved our
objective, bringing to an
end an arduous mission.
Resourcefulness, resil-
ience and resolve. These
traits are what I took away
after 22 months.

(On his experience of
Basic Military Train-
ing)
A typical day starts as
early as 5 in the morning,
when across the bunks
a flurry of activity is set
off as recruits scramble
to wash up and assemble.
Commanders do not take
lateness lightly, with
punctuality measured
down to the second.
Push-ups, pull-ups,
sit-ups, and timed runs
are the bread and butter
of any day’s activities.
I recall fondly my com-
pany’s pre-meal routine,
where each recruit had
to complete a minimum
number of pull-ups before
the platoon could proceed
for meals.
With Singapore’s strict
gun laws, most Singapo-
reans have never seen a
gun in person – let alone
handled one – making the
‘Weapon Presentation’ a
momentous occasion for
each recruit.
Performed under the
cover of darkness, sym-
bolically representing the
need to shield an army’s
assets from the prying
eyes of the enemy, each
recruit is presented with
the iconic SAR-21 assault
rifle. Affectionately
referred to as our “wives”,
a soldier is rarely seen
without it by his side.
The dreaded field camp
represents the climax of
Basic Military Training.
Recruits will head into
the jungle to hone their
individual fieldcraft,
where they would be at
the mercy of the elements.
Torrential downpours,
blistering tropical sun,
dense undergrowth, and
humidity so palpable it
feels like your thickest
winter coat is strangling
you. Digging of ‘shell
scrapes’ (shallow trenches
which also doubled as
our beds), combat move-
ments as a section, and
situational tests result in a
bone-tired, mud-encrust-
ed soldier at the end of
each day. Encounters with
snakes, scorpions and
the occasional wild boar
add to the flavour of the
experience.
My nights were spent
comfortably nestled in my
far from civilisation, a
tilt of the head leaves one
enthralled by the millions
of bright stars dotting the
night sky. This coupled
with the tranquility of the
rainforest and the lull of
its nocturnal inhabitants
offered a brief respite
from the most arduous
portion of basic training.

Many recruits would
probably describe the
‘tough times’, so here’s
my take on the funnier
side of the experience.
Here are the top 2 ‘LOL’
moments in my NS life.
Ambushing the enemy
with his pants down (lit-
erally): sometimes the call
of nature is just too strong
and when you’re out in
the wild, the jungle is your
toilet. Trying to conceal
our movement, we slowly
leopard-crawled towards
the enemy position –
taking care not to alert
them to our presence.
Once we were within
firing distance, we readied
our rifles and tried to
spot the enemy through
our scopes. Expecting
a highly camouflaged
and entrenched enemy
position, little did we
expect 2 bare bottoms
facing us. Needless to
say, we caught them off
guard and completed the
mission successfully.
Then there was the
‘jungle chef’ incident:
sometimes the lack of
food messed with our
minds. Infantry officer
cadets go through a three-
day survival training
course where they learn to
live off the land and build
shelters from available
materials. During this
time they are required to
demonstrate certain skills
they have been taught, in-
cluding the identification
and preparation of plant
food – in this case the
Simpoh Ayer leaf. Typi-
cally, the leaf is prepared
for consumption by
boiling. The lack of food
must have gotten to one
particular cadet because
he decided to roast the
leaf, placing it directly
above the fire, almost
setting fire to it and the
surrounding structures he
built.
Despite national
service being a compul-
sory two-year thing, on
the brighter side it has
left us with these fond
memories. Also, they give
you free food, clothes,
and housing, plus the
occasional allowance.
What’s not to like?

T
he UK stopped
National Service
(NS) in 1963.
Before that,
from the ages of 18-21,
all males were required
to serve in the Armed
Services for 18 months.
In some countries,
however, service is still
required. The Republic
of Singapore is no excep-
tion; ‘boys become men’.
Here are the stories of the
experiences of Imperial
Engineers in NS, repro-
duced from Guildsheet
Issue IV.
Andrew Ng (42nd
Singapore Armoured
Regiment)
22 months. That is the
amount of time it takes
to complete 2 academic
years here at Imperial. It
was the amount of time
that I spent in the Singa-
pore Army. I served in the
Armoured Infantry, oper-
ating alongside armoured
fighting vehicles and main
battle tanks.
I often get asked “what
was it like serving in the
army?” It was loud, dirty
and tiring. However, at
the end of the day I got to
blow stuff up – something
most 19-year-olds get a
kick out of. The sulphur
from puffs of gunpowder
irritates the eyes, the
shockwave from the
cannon on the Leopard II
Main Battle Tank knocks
you in the chest, and the
rattle of gunfire rings in
your eardrums.
These are just some
things that no video game,
documentary, or book can
hope to describe. Every
person who has served in
a combat unit will have
his definitive moment,
