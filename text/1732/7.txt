and UK (by the way, Hong
Kong’s citizens were NOT
allowed to vote under
British colonialism!),
defacing the Chinese
emblem, outright racist
obscene slogans against
their fellow countrymen.
I am absolutely disgusted
when I see these pictures.
Chinese politics is ex-
tremely different from
its western counterparts.
Most of us view social
and economic stability as
a precursor to the extra
freedoms held as sacred
in the west. This culture
is still held amongst many
of the Chinese, mainland
or overseas. Therefore
the chaos in Hong Kong
garners no significant
Chinese sympathy.
Additionally, I do
acknowledge that Hong
Kong’s citizens are ex-
tremely dissatisfied with
the local government.
However, it has more to
do with its economy and
rising property prices/
living costs which has
turned much of the youth
desperate and angry for
change. However, this
anger is misdirected. The
tycoons, who jettisoned
HK’s former Chief Exec-
utive Tung Chee Hwa’s
plan to build 85,000
affordable homes a year.
believing that this scheme
would send property
prices plummeting, public
opinion turned against him
and forced him to abandon
his plan. Thus, the marked
increase in property
prices, which have risen
300% since 2003. Hong
Kong’s citizens should
turn their wrath towards
the city’s elite, instead of
the government.
Additionally, Chinese
history also shapes our
worldview. A hundred
years of humiliation and
decades of bullying by
the west (the bombing
of the Chinese embassy
in Belgrade, the full
embargo led by America
and constant demonisa-
tion of the Chinese gov-
ernment, despite it lifting
700 million people out of
poverty within a century)
have led to a very patriotic
population that thinks
itself unfairly targeted
by the same West who
profited as much from
cheap prices as China
from technology gains.
In the end, Hong Kong
is China. The very first
Article of the Basic Law
states so. Anyone who is
familiar with the Basic
Law and its complexities
can see that Hong Kong
is an indivisible part
of China. Hong Kong
citizens, in my opinion,
should be proud of their
heritage, not try to iden-
tify themselves as distinct
from Chinese people.
That is how the world
views us. To preserve
Hong Kong’s autonomy,
the best thing to do would
be to prove that the ‘1
Country, 2 Systems’ prin-
ciple is essential for the
city’s prosperity, instead
of being a recipe for
disaster. The smart thing
would be to convince the
Chinese government that
Hong Kong should be
kept as a world-class tax
haven (with little political
cost). Showing that the
extradition bill would ad-
versely affect this would
allow for the Basic Law to
be extended beyond 2047.
That would be a victory
for most Hong Kong
citizens.
