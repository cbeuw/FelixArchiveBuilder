[Blank]- Giving Justice to Women’s Voices
A
mother who
excitedly enters
into a new allur-
ing relationship
is later horrifically mur-
dered by her new lover.
Another mother navigates
the demands of her eldest
daughter who desperately
appeals to her to help fund
her habits. Two young
girls, who meet in foster
care, struggle over the
power balance of a shared
bedroom. These are a
mere snapshot of the 100
the subject of women in
prison at the forefront
of our discussion. I can
honestly say that the
founding mothers of Clean
Break have achieved
their goal, at least within
myself, as days on I am
still left contemplating the
beautifully woven scenes
which have stemmed
many conversations.
The majority of scenes
were brief, standalone
snippets of how the prison
system impacts the many
facets of a woman’s life.
However, it was not
difficult to see the strands
which ran between the vi-
gnettes. During the latter
half of the play, we switch
drivers and instead gain
an invitation to a dinner
party where a group of
friends gather together to
eat, drink and be merry.
Amongst the guests is
Shona Babayemi, one of
Clean Break’s very own,
who is set to meet the
group for the first time, ac-
companying her new girl-
friend. We come to know
the group as a community
serving bunch; a solicitor,
therapist and publican
amongst them. With
the help of Babayemi’s
provocative dialogue,
she unveils the hypocrisy
and all to near parallels
which run between our
group of philanthropists
and the wonderful women
we met earlier. With the
same actress playing both
a quirky activist with
a seemingly innocent
weekend habit and the
aforementioned desperate
daughter, we are reminded
of the similarities rather
than differences that we
R
unning for a
mere three
weeks at The
Old Vic, Lungs
promised to recapture the
magic that Claire Foy
and Matt Smith brought
to the first two seasons
of The Crown on Netflix
to the stage. I’m not one
to blindly buy tickets for
the sake of the play’s star
power(Imadethatmistake
once with When We Have
Sufficiently Tortured
Each Other, starring Cate
Blanchett and Stephen
Dillane), but as the tickets
went on sale back in June,
I found myself frantically
attempting to get in the
virtual queue while trying
to board my flight back to
London.
Lungs, written by
Duncan McMillan, starts
off as a discussion at
Ikea between a couple on
whether they should have
a child together. Plagued
by the state of the world
we live in, their dilemma
is whether two smart,
good people would con-
tribute to overpopulation
and bring forth another
life which would result
in a carbon footprint the
weight of the Eiffel Tower.
It argues that if people
truly had the planet’s best
interests in mind, not only
would we not be having
children, but we would be
killing ourselves, some-
thing no one is willing to
do. Does this make us all
selfish?
Although the script
often opts in for broad
strokes, moving from
one moment in the lives
of the characters to the
next abruptly, the focus is
always razor sharp. The
staging is simple, with
minimal yet effective
lighting and sound. The
audience is placed behind
the stage in addition to the
usual auditorium set-up,
which adds to the feeling
of peeking into the char-
acters’ lives. Despite the
frequent and considerable
time and location jumps,
the play flows brilliantly.
The fast pace and the ev-
er-changing nature of the
play keeps the audience
on their toes regardless of
the vastly conversational
tone of the play.
Smith is great, and
his chemistry with Foy
unparalleled to anyone
else in my recent memory.
However, Foy is absolute-
ly transcendent in her role,
taking every sentence and
making them resonate
with such depth that the
audience can’t help but
be drawn in. The acting
is so profoundly affecting
that it elevates the already
extremely relevant,
relatable, and ultimately
important script.
The ending is so mag-
nificent and devastating
that it leaves the audience
to ponder on the meaning
of this bleak yet beautiful
life. Like all excellent
theatre, it paves the way
for personal reflection,
letting the audience have
an incredibly personal,
intimate reaction to what
they have seen. It’s just
a shame that it is only
running for such a short
period.

plate our own blind self.
The monumental
acting delivered by the
entire female-only cast
coupled together with the
poignant setting was ever
so slightly dampened by
the, at times, unrealistic
dialogue. This however
is an afterthought to
the sheer awe that the
audience sat in as we mar-
velled at both the wonder
of the cast and the stark
reality of their stories. An
absolute must watch.
