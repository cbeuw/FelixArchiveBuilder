A CONVERSATION WITH... felix@imperial.ac.uk
This week, Felix sat down with the Deputy President (Welfare), Shervin Sabeghi, to talk about year reps and
elections, Liberation reform, and the Athena Swan and the Race Equality Charter
Felix: How has it been
so far?
It’s been busy, and never
really quietens down
much! It’s been waves
of different things. Over
summer, at the begin-
ning, there was a lot of
settling in, and then there
was a wave of college
meetings, now it’s a wave
of dealing with volunteers
– elections, training, and
so on. It’s been nice in
my role to get to see a
big cross-section of the
College – it clues you
in to services you didn’t
even know existed, and
learn a lot more about
how everything works.
Felix: You’re some-
one who was quite
involved with the
Union as a rep and
in the RCSU before
entering this role
– but were still una-
ware. Do you think
there needs to be
more communication
about how things
work behind the
scenes?
It’s not necessarily crucial
for students to know the
behind the scenes stuff
– it’s like the ‘swan on
water’ analogy. Students
should see the majestic
swan gliding by, while
beneath the surface
there’s a lot of thrashing
to keep it all working! I’d
like to think that students
who need certain ser-
vices do find out about
them – for example, I
never needed the Centre
for Academic English so
didn’t know about it for
a long time, but I’d hope
a student who did would
find it.
College has been doing
stuff in this direction –
they just launched the
new student support zone
on the website, which
restructures how informa-
tion about services is pre-
sented to students. Instead
of being a list of services,
it focuses on what areas
a student might struggle
in, and then directs them
to the right information.
The goal is for students to
feel like there is an ‘air’
or atmosphere of support,
which is what I think is
often lacking.
Felix: One thing I
hear a lot of is a new
focus on“student
experience”and
“holistic wellbeing”
and such – including
the idea of a‘wellbe-
ing hub’being built.
The student support
zone seems to be in
that trend of central-
ising issues students
might have so they
can more easily find
information. What
are your thoughts?
It’s potentially beneficial.
I can definitely see the
value of knowing for
certain that a space for
your wellbeing exists,
and it might help add to
that air of support. If it
was ever going to happen
it would be a very long-
term, high-level, strategic
project!
I don’t know if this is
the best way to use that
amount of resources,
though – particularly
space-wise given how
cramped things are at the
South Ken campus – and
I worry about College
committing to such a big
project and maybe then
putting off doing other im-
portant things. One thing
to remember is that over
the next couple of decades
it seems the College will
be moving to a multi-cam-
pus style. Even now only
a half to a third of students
are regularly on the South
Kensington campus, and
many more are only part-
time for example – so such
