JESUS... this record is disappointing
Kanye West’s lastest album is shit
K
anye West
needs no
introduction.
By the time
this is published he will
undoubtedly have kicked
up a fresh onslaught of
headlines that even dedi-
cated fans must be jaded
with at this point. In other
news, research suggests
that narcissists are more
likely to be successful
than people with healthy
attitudes to self.
Kanye West’s latest
release JESUS IS KING
follows his 2017 pattern
of releasing trimmed
down records, with a
run time short of half an
hour with every track
under 4 minutes. The
most obvious thing that
distinguishes it from Ye is
its attitude to life, while Ye
explores the jagged edges
of West’s bipolar disorder,
as well as West’s complex
relationship with women,
JESUS IS KING finds
Kanye returning to the
religious roots that shone
through on gems like
“Jesus Walks” more than
10 years ago.
JESUS IS KING’s
gospel influences are
apparent in the album’s
palette. The opening
track is amongst many
others to revolve around
layered, soulful vocals,
although autotune and
a touch of compression
give them a distinctively
modern sound, reminis-
cent of Bon Iver’s recent
outings, or perhaps more
obviously any number
of modern-day croon
rappers. Numerous gospel
samples (including a
reuse of father stretch my
hands) provide the basis
for tracks. None of these
however, are innovative
or interesting.
On JESUS IS KING’s
strongest tracks we find
Kanye’s following of
Kids See Ghosts and the
Life of Pablo, packing
thick sub-bass and explo-
sive percussion into the
climax of “Selah”. The
LP brims with eclectic
instrumental choices,
from the aforementioned
gospel vocals, which find
different contexts on each
track; from Psychedelic
on “Water”, to epic on
“Selah”, and of course
passionate and soulful on
“Ever Hour” and “God
is”; moody classical
guitar on “Closed on
Sunday”; and glossy,
bubble-gum synths on
Pi’erre Bourne-produced
“On God”.
Features from Clipse
(Pusha T and his brother)
stand out for their blunt,
well-crafted rhymes,
Kenny G’s appearance on
the same track fits surpris-
ingly well. Unfortunately,
West’s songwriting kills
the listenability of tracks;
it is evident the Keeping
up with the Kardashians
star has little to say, his
religious message inco-
herent and inconsistent,
and his verses filled with
inane bars on not “letting
his family starve” and
people judging him, which
come across as blander
and more unrelatable than
ever. Upon further rumi-
nation, not a word or tune
from Kanye’s mouth adds
value to the record.
West also treats listen-
ers to his un-autotuned
voice, an abhorrent timbre
that manages to be thin
and painful on the ear at
the same time. The grating
of West’s vocal chords is
worsened when they carry
the weak melodic lines
of tracks like “Closed on
Sunday” and “On God”;
please don’t subject
yourself to them.
Ultimately, while
JESUS IS KING brings
a few interesting tracks
to the table, most don’t
warrant a second thought.
A first listen is generous,
and no listening is best.
“The whole
thing just
slaps. Trust
me”- Kanye
West
“Ultimately,
not a word
or tune from
Kanye’s mouth
adds value to
the record”
