Overdue books
at the library
have become an
ever increasing
menace over the last few
weeks. In order to ensure
their safe return, the
library has been forced to
take desperate measures,
by hiring a necromancer
and their legions of un-
dead slaves.
Central Library’s
manager Dhris Tanks
said, “We decided it was
time to rattle some bones.
And no I don’t mean those
weirdos that have sex on
third floor. Those little
shits have what’s coming
to them, I can’t even get
my hands on a copy of
Ghastly Alice’s Autobi-
ography- The Art of the
Oil Deal”. She further
commented that students
should be thankful for
the unique life skills that
come with the experience
of monstrous beasts
knocking on their door.
“It will be helpful when
student finances come for
their loan repayments.
Things go bump in the
night”
When asked why
college security weren’t
employed instead, an
informant, commented
“Tanks only wants to
teach the students a
lesson, not forbid them
from entering the library
because it’s 1 person over
capacity. The advantage
of using skeletons is that
they always mechanically
walk through the right
door, like well oiled ma-
chines. Most importantly
they don’t ask questions
and can’t catch mumps.”
When asked how sus-
tainable the book recov-
ery programme was Tanks
did not respond. Upon
asking the Necromancer,
he responded, “I’ve been
collecting souls for nigh
on seven centuries, but it
has never been so diffi-
cult! I’ve been wandering
around the Business
School for weeks now
and everyone has sold
themselves to something
known as ‘Finance.’”
When asked about his
success with returning the
books to the library, he
declined to answer, mut-
tering something about
a “liber morticus.” Each
skeleton merely grated
its teeth in response to
requests for interview,
although some were later
found hiding in Sabbijay
Doods cupboard.
