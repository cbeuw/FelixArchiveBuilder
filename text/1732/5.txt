Northern Ireland Abortion and Gay Rights
Comment writer Andy Wang thinks that it’s about time that Northern Ireland moves into line
with the rest of the UK

A
bortion was de-
criminalised in
England, Wales
and Scotland
in 1967 and was made
available through the
NHS for free. Same-sex
marriage was legalised in
England & Wales in 2013
and 2014 in Scotland.
Unfortunately, neither of
these rights fully extend
to Northern Ireland.
In July, the UK gov-
ernment introduced the
Northern Ireland Exec-
utive Formation Bill in
the UK Parliament. This
was a largely technical
and politically neutral
legal instrument required
due to the ongoing sus-
pension of the Northern
Irish Assembly as the
Nationalists and the Un-
ionists could not agree
on a power sharing
deal in 2017. For over
1000 days, Northern
Ireland has been running
without a government
and no legislation could
have been passed in the
NI Assembly.
Two Labour MPs sub-
mitted two amendments
to the Bill, forcing the
laws legalising abortion
and same-sex marriage
to be extended to
Northern Ireland unless
the NI Assembly can
resume sitting before
21st October with a
government formed.
No power-sharing deal
was agreed and no
government could be
formed. Now the UK
government will have
to elevate abortion right
and marriage equality
in Northern Ireland to
the same standard as the
rest of the UK by April
2020.
The island of Ireland
has been notorious for
its ultra-conservative
stance on social libera-
tion, with the Republic
being generally worse
off than the North.
Divorce was, bizarre-
ly, not allowed in the
Republic until in 1995,
when the Irish people
voted in favour of
divorce rights by 50.3%
to 49.7%. In both the
North and the Republic,
carrying out abortion
was punishable by life
imprisonment unless the
life of the mother was
threatened. So says the
law, however in 2012,
a Galway resident was
refused abortion despite
her deteriorating health.
She died of sepsis 5 days
later.
The table has turned
in recent years, with
the Republic legalising
same-sex marriage
in 2015 and allowed
abortion on-demand in
2018. These archaic laws
remained in Northern
Ireland. It should be
noted, however, that
same-sex couples in
Northern Ireland were
able to obtain civil
partnership status since
2004. Starting from June
2017, NHS England also
provides free abortion
service to Northern Irish
residents with travel
costs reimbursed. This
arrangement is certainly
welcomed, but it came
far too late and can
hardly be considered
accessible, especially
for women in vulnerable
groups.
In 1967, legislations
from Westminster gener-
ally applied to the whole
of the United Kingdom.
Northern Ireland was
explicitly excluded from
the Act decriminalising
abortion. Since the
late 1990s, devolved
legislatures were set up
in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland with
Westminster devolving
numerous powers to
these regional assem-
blies. Abortion and
marriage are among
these devolved matters
(except for Wales).
Same-sex marriage was
made legal in England
and Wales in 2013, with
the Scottish parliament
promptly following
suit in early 2014.
The Northern Irish
assembly voted 4 times
to legalise same-sex
marriage since 2012,
with all being defeated
by a narrow margin.
In 2015, legalisation
of same-sex marriage
finally received majority
support in Stormont,
however this vote was
nullified through an
abuse of petition of
concern.
Ironically, the biggest
devil in the play is the
Democratic Unionist
Party. As the name
suggests, the DUP
supports Northern
Ireland remaining in the
United Kingdom with
strengthening ties with
Great Britain. With what
I regard as one of the
most egregious political
hypocrisy currently in
existence, the DUP stood
consistently opposed
to abortion rights, a
policy adapted, accepted
and taken as norm by
millions of Britons for
more than half a century,
and arguably, one that
distinguishes whether a
country is living in the
present or past . The
DUP has also consist-
ently opposed same-sex
marriage, a policy that
once again, is widely
supported across the
UK.
The Nationalist camp
is mostly supportive of
social liberation, despite
having a strong tie with
Catholicism through its
pro-Irish Reunification
voter base. Sinn Féin,
the largest nationalist
party, had a reserved
stance on abortion
rights until ultimately in
2018, adopted a stance
to allow abortion on
demand. Sinn Féin has
also supported same-sex
marriage, while refusing
to form a government
with the DUP unless they
agree to work towards
marriage equality. SDLP
labelled themselves
a motion “That this
Assembly agrees that
the legislative position
on abortion in Northern
Ireland will most appro-
priately be determined
by the Northern Ireland
Assembly”. Or, in other
words, “we’ll abuse
the procedure to block
it even if decriminali-
sation of abortion gets
majority support in the
Assembly, just like what
we did with same-sex
marriage.”
Indeed there are few
major parties in Western
Europe with such a hard-
line regressive ideology,
and even fewer parties
that openly take pride
in such fundamentalism.
The DUP’s stance is not
the path history takes,
and they will promptly
be remembered as the
antagonist in the struggle
for social liberation.
as “pro-life” although
gave MLAs free vote
on the matter. SDLP has
also voted in favour of
marriage equality in all
the 5 votes tabled to the
Assembly between 2012
and 2015.
Put it this way: you
know you are probably
in the wrong when
Catholic sympathisers
are more socially liberal
than you. The DUP
unfortunately doesn’t
get it, and continued
its attempt to sabotage
social progression even
after the UK Parliament
has affirmed its stance.
The DUP requested
the NI Assembly to
be summoned on 21st
October, on the deadline
set out by the NI Exec-
utive Formation Act.
This was of course
futile as a government
couldn’t possibly have
been formed on the day.
