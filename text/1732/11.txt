The Quest for Supremacy in the Indian Ocean and its
Victims: the Chagos Islands

n the last few weeks
the news cycle has
been fixated on
protests around the
world, from Catalonia,
to Chile and Hong Kong,
to climate change and
to Ecuador. All of these
are processes which deal
with the lives of countless
people. These movements
tend to make one reflect
on the influence of the
masses on the govern-
ment, if not by managing
to push change through,
at least by showing their
displeasure, sometimes
through violence. Entire
philosophical thoughts are
founded on the analysis of
such influence, focusing
for example on the crea-
tion of the social contract,
as Hobbes and Rousseau
did. But this is not what
this article will deal with;
this is the story of what
happens when the people
are deprived of their rights
because they are simply
not enough strong to make
themselves heard. It is,
as often has been, David
versus Goliath.
The year was 1965,
the United Kingdom was
about to relinquish its
sovereignty over Mauri-
tius, an insular state in the
Indian Ocean located not
too far from Madagascar.
Proper independence for
Mauritians would follow
three years later, but in
that fatidic year Harold
Wilson’s governments
implemented the separa-
tion between the island
of Mauritius itself and
an archipelago located
halfway between the
main island and India, the
Chagos Islands. France
had administered the
dependency of the archi-
pelago to Mauritius in the
mid 18th Century when
they claimed the territory,
and they have belonged to
document from 1966 by
Foreign Office’s senior
advisor Denis Greenhill
refers to the islanders as
“some few Tarzans and
Men Fridays” in a sad
reference to Edgar Rice
Burrough’s and Daniel
Defoe’s masterpieces
respectively.
After being constrained
to leave their homes, the
Chagossians were at least
granted in 2002 the right
to British Citizenship,
allowing many of them
and their descendants to
move to Britain, founding
a conspicuous community
in Crawley, West Sussex.
There, some have recently
denounced the existence
of a hostile environment
in a period in which the
Windrush scandal is still
firm in the memory of
most.
In 2017, the Interna-
tional Court of Justice was
called to evaluate whether
splitting the archipelago
from Mauritius was
lawful and what the legal
consequences and obliga-
tions are that the United
Kingdom has to undertake
due to its continuous
control of the islands.

British Empire,

much influence
as possible
was certainly
in its interest”

the same colonial entity
ever since. During the
Napoleonic Wats, the UK
captured Mauritius from
France, thus also gaining
sovereignty over the ar-
chipelago. But the winds
had begun to change for
the UK after the Second
World War and the sun
was finally setting on the
British Empire, although
preserving as much
influence as possible was
certainly in its interest.
The Chagos Archipelago,
scarcely populated and
located in a key strate-
gical position, would
certainly fit this purpose.
Thus, in 1968 the British
Government began to
forcibly relocate the two
thousand inhabitants to
Mauritius, to create space
for the establishment of an
American military base on
the newly created British
Indian Ocean Territory. A

To that matter, the Court
answered in February that
the UK is under obligation
to end its administration
of the islands as soon
as possible, deeming it
unlawful. In an ensuing
vote at the UN General
Assembly about the
issue, the UK and the US
experienced a crushing
defeat 116-6, with many
traditional allies either
abstaining or voting in
favour of the complete
decolonisation of the area.
Even Pope Francis asked
for its return to Mauritius,
whose Prime Minister,
Pravind Jugnauth, defined
the Chagossians’ removal
as “akin to a crime against
humanity”. Meanwhile, in
September, it was revealed
that a secretive visit had
taken place to the islands,
the first formal one by
MPs, two Conservatives
and one Labour member.
This was regarded by
some as an expression
of Britain’s intention to
in Asia between the US
and China. One possible
scenario if Britain hands
back the islands to Mauri-
tius, is that they could be
leased by Mauritian au-
thorithiestoChinainstead,
inverting the power
balance in the Indian
Ocean. The bitter irony
would be that by repairing
a damage to the principles
of self-determination
and basic civil rights,
these western powers
could actually be doing a
favour to a country which
systematically disrespects
them on much larger
scale. Therefore, whilst
the confrontation in the
Orient grows in intensity,
so does the grief of those
deprived of their ancestral
soil, and this is why it is
not the last we will hear of
the name Chagos.
reassert its claim over the
territory.
The UK will certainly
not surrender the Chagos
Islands because of a
mere non-binding UN
resolution, bringing to
mind an issue other than
post-colonialism that
should be considered: the
Islands’ strategical impor-
tance. The American base
currently, and possibly
even more so in the future,
plays a significant role in
the fight for supremacy
