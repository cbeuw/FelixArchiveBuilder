N
ext summer,
Bike the UK
for MS cyclists
will be hitting
the road once again as they
pedal to raise funds and
awareness for Multiple
Sclerosis.
The charity, founded
by University of Bath
student James Whateley,
started in 2014 following
his experience of cycling
across America as a 19
year old and meeting
Bike the US for MS on
route. Having met some
incredible people living
with MS, hearing their
stories and seeing their
outlook on life, he wanted
others to experience the
same – travelling the
country, pushing yourself
out of your comfort zone,
all whilst supporting those
who need it most.
Five years on, Bike the
UK for MS now offers a
range of supported trips
every summer including
the classic John O’Groats
to Land’s End and Sea to
Sea routes. With no sign
up fee and a managea-
ble fundraising target,
students from all across
the country are signing up
to explore the country on
two wheels.
The charity works
closely with the wider
MS Society. On route,
riders stop off with local
MS groups allowing them
to meet the communities
their fundraising directly
supports. Alongside the
local support, Bike the
UK for MS helps fund
national research projects
with the MS Society to
one day Stop MS.
Hazel May, who was
taken part in a ride with
Bike the UK for MS, says:
“The rides and experi-
ences that I have had are
probably the most fun I
have had on a bike. The
scenery through Scotland
was exquisite, as was
witnessing an actual
mermaid in a loch (a weird
lady with a mermaid tail
on flailing around in the
shallows), these are things
I will never forget. As we
headed south, even better
memories and friendships
were made. In Bath, as
with many of our stops
on this trip, we met with
MS societies and met
the people who we were
fundraising for. These
meetings made the trip
even more special and
the miles mean so much
more. The way the trips
are organised means that
everyday all you have to
do is get up, eat and ride at
your own pace. Therefore,
this means you can blitz
it from A to B or meander
and find a spoons should
you feel like it. The way
the team works enables
this level of flexibility
and thus these trips are for
everyone and I encourage
everyone who has a bike
to go and do any of the
rides on offer.”
