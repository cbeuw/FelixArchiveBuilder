Sick Boy lookalike bringing the disco vibes

printworks next weekend. But what will the Scotsman bring to the Press Halls? Will it be hot air or even hotter
heels on the dancefloor?
T
he white hair, the
Scottishness, the
pomp he brings to
his sets – a lot of
the elements of 26-year-
old Hector Barbour’s alter
ego point to the man from
Trainspotting. But while
the difficult path that
Hector was on may well
have led him to the same
kind of sorry existence
that his on-screen coun-
terpart lived through, it
was thanks to Denis Sulta
that Hector saw the light.
Hailing from an artistic
cocoon, Hector first
wanted to become a free-
style skier. It was through
dropping out of university
and getting a job at a
Glaswegian record store
that he fell in love with
disco. A few years and
a move to Berlin later,
his sound now has a new
depth to it. It ranges from
pimped-up disco house on
his Sulta Selects Volume 3
to an edgier, underworldly
clang on the little taste
test we’ve had from his
upcoming EP. Aye Spoake
Te Sumwuhn & They
Listenhd is coming out on
Ninja Tune the day before
the big Printworks debut.
Why Sulta? As it turns
outthenameistheepitome
of the change in Hector’s
mindset which allowed
him to become who he is
today. A flip of the switch.
The young Barbour had
been struggling with
trying to establish himself
in the music business and
felt a void around him
following his departure
from university. Drugs
and depression took their
toll. When, eventually, he
got better, he decided to
turn it all around quite lit-
erally – and from his then
creative moniker Atlus,
Sulta was born.
The rambunctious
blondie vibing with every
single stomp, jump, and
fist-pump in the audience
in front of him can be a
lesson to us all. After all,
it was a friend’s simple
act of kindness which was
the catalyst for Denis’
turnaround. It unlocked
not only a creative force
which is carrying the Scot
to the top of modern house
music, but also added a
positive entry to the list
of musical alter egos ex-
ploring the manifestation
of the self as a projection
for the audience. David
Bowie moved to Berlin
to retire one of his most
famous alter egos but for
Hector, Berlin was just the
beginning. The thin white
duke may have lived off
peppers, cocaine and milk
for months, but all that
Sulta lives off now are
good vibes.
“He vibes with
every stomp,
jump and fist-
pump in the
audience ”

Nick Cave’s Piercing Exploration of Grief
Nick Cave’s new record ‘Ghosteen’ deals with loss with a defter hand than previous work, finding moments of
beauty amonst the grief
H
unched among
a small crowd
in Rough Trade
East, bags
on our laps and posters
bundled awkwardly
around us, we heard Nick
Cave and the Bad Seed’s
Ghosteen for the first
time. It was the album’s
premiere and I was at an
album playback party
only a week after its
release had been casually
announced via Nick
Cave’s Q&A website The
Red Hand Files. It was an
intimate session. We sat,
uncomfortable, still, and
completely silent until the
music had been played.
Ghosteen appears
just four years after the
tragic death of Nick
Cave’s son Arthur and
three years since the
release of Skeleton Tree,
an album written primar-
ily before but delivered
after his death. Where
Skeleton Tree was a bleak,
dark, immediate reaction
to a life-shaking tragedy,
Ghosteen is a frank ex-
ploration of a grief that
ebbs and flows, revealing
moments of comfort, and
it is riddled with fantasy
and wonder. Nick Cave’s
uncharacteristic falsetto
rings hauntingly out,
trembling but strong, over
the analogue synthesizers.
The album is not so much a
demonstration of his own
emotions, but an attempt
to share them. He forces
the listener to engage with
these feelings. “Holly-
wood” finishes the album
off by telling the story of
Kisa Guatami, who could
not find a household un-
touched by death to save
her dying baby, and Nick
Cave creates a connection
with anyone who has
experienced grief with
the reminder that death
is a part of life and love
and it touches us all. This
connection is a feat he has
been attempting over the
past year in his frank and
open Red Hand Files.
In one answer, he
described finding his
wonder and natural cu-
riosity again following
his son’s death, and this
comes across clearly in
Ghosteen. Whilst Arthur’s
death punctuates the
whole album, the songs
are full of bright images
and moments - even the
cover depicts picturesque
animals, with a lion peace-
fully lying beside a lamb.
“Bright Horses” breaks
this image: “We’re all so
tired of seeing things as
they are / Horses are just
horses and their manes
aren’t full of fire”, Cave
sings, but the fantasies
and spirits that he claims
are key to surviving
through grief are painted
beautifully in the music.
If you’re looking for
nice background music or
something to sing along
to, then this album is not
for you. But sit down and
have a listen if you want
some music that taps into
your emotions and hurts.
