Pony: sterilisation of bedroom pop or an intentional
shift in creative direction?
T
here are lots of
bedroom pop art-
ists breaking into
the mainstream
these days (Clairo, Gus
Dapperton, Boy Pablo,
Omar Apollo, etc.), but
the undisputed king is
Rex Orange County.
After featuring on Tyler,
the Creator’s Flower
Boy, Rex leapt from 500
followers on SoundCloud
to being one of the biggest
new names in the music
industry. Since then we’ve
been waiting eagerly for
his third album.
Two years in the spot-
light appears to have left
Rex a little shell shocked.
Much of the focus of Pony
is his struggle in new
environments and being
separated from those he
loves. While this shift has
certainly left him with
some good material to
write about, it seems as
though it’s also caused a
rift in his style. The “hazy
Sunday morning” charm
of his older material has
been entirely abandoned.
I hesitate to say this is
intentional as particular
tracks on Pony are clearly
trying to capture the
cushy/youthful energy of
bedroom pop – “10/10”,
“Never Had The Balls”
and “Face To Face”. All
those songs fuckin’ slap
there’s no denying, but
they’re missing a soul.
Possibly the style didn’t
hold its colours through
the wash of label and
executive influence.
Even worse, songs like
“Always” and “Stressed
Out” are void of originali-
ty and drone on in places.
While the bedroom
pop themes suffer,
Rex’s larger sounding
orchestral-infused tracks
are doing him wonders.
The power supplied by
RCA records has granted
him access to expand
the amount he uses large
numbers of instruments.
The utilisation of weighti-
er instrumentation appears
across the album and is
more prominent in tracks
like “Pluto Projector”
and “Laser Lights”. Rex
hits his stride with these
grandiose compositions
in “It Gets Better”, where
the indie and operatic
pop genre influences of
the album come together
beautifully. There is cer-
tainly a comparison to be
drawn to operatic/baroque
pop artist Rufus Wain-
wright, with Rex being
the modern-day version.
Rex’s strong storytell-
ing is his main play here,
but it leaves a desire for
more creative wordplay.
There are a few great
tongue-in-cheek lines
that catch you off guard –
“Sometimes you gotta cut
a bitch out”. Also a few
get you in the feels – “I
open up when shit gets
built up this high/ She
makes it easy to cry”.
The album displays
many of Rex’s strongest
traits, unfortunately just
not the best instances.
Track-by-track the album
lacks consistency as it
fails to walk the tightrope
of jolly and depressed.
Hopefully Rex’s next
project can be pointed in
a clearer direction.

Cigarettes
After Sex are back with
more noir dream-pop,
echoey guitars, and
amazing vocals. Greg
Gonzalez sounds deep in
love, as he whispers the
lyrics, slow-as-molasses,
in songs like “Pure” &
“Touch”. His penchant for
lovely, lilting melodies,
and the sound, with the
loud bass and interlocking
guitar lines, give a rich
texture to the nine tracks,
which progressively cas-
cade into different stages
of a relationship, similar
to mini-narratives, about
random sexual encounters
and misadventures.
Songs like the dusky
“Heavenly” or the elegant
“Falling in Love” are
hypnotic, but the hooks
are splendid examples of
songwriting. The former
opens with a sound that
carries a slight amount of
urgencyinit,accompanied
by the bass and the vocals
that work off of each
other gorgeously before
waves of guitar punctuate
the softness of the chorus
(“Because this is where
I want to be/Where it’s
so sweet and heavenly”).
Although the humour that
was present in the earlier
album has been replaced
by a deeper sincerity,
even the song, “Hentai”,
the Japanese anime form
of pornography, feels like
a contemplation on love,
with Gonzalez crooning
the words “Beautiful
hearts are in your eyes”,
and makes you wonder if
it’s meant for someone or
something.
Sonically, the new
album sounds like an
impressive collection. It’s
quite easy to write a bunch
of slow songs with similar
chords, but the band is
immensely talented and
their work has a certain
truth and sadness that
helps them create a record
that feels as smooth as silk
and moves in a way that is
similar to a well-directed
movie, and even though
some critics say that every
song sounds the same,
it’s their similarities that
become their strengths,
gradually setting a hazy,
unshakable mood. “All
the blatantly audible
influences become irrel-
evant, leaving Cigarettes
After Sex with a sound
of its own, created with
scant tools and seemingly
minimal effort. Like the
best sleight of hand magi-
cians, the trick’s conjured
before you, then gone.”,
one of the critics claimed.
Where most indie and
pop bands often overshad-
ow their lead vocalist in
echo, reducing them to just
another component within
the wistful drift of sound,
Gonzalez is the centre of
attention here. Cigarettes
After Sex’s sound is the
trademark loud bass and
interlocking guitar lines,
which are very clearly
defined – but there’s no
doubt that the focus is
Gonzalez and the lyrics.
The album washes you
over with a drowsy haze,
the kind of feeling you
get when you stay up all
night, talking to someone,
and the words fill your
heart with a certain
longing, and through
wallowing in its own mire
and coming out the other
side, Cry becomes one of
those restrained albums
where tempo, repetition,
and muted composition
construct an entire story
within the pauses between
the notes and the ideas
between the lines.
