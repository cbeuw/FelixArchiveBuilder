Zombi Child
Zombi Child manages to be visually gorgeous, taking advantage of the oft-overlooked beauty of Haiti, but
manages to lose a sense of respect for Haiti by abusing clichés in the final scenes
D

(thanks to a
slice-and-dice
scene with a giant fish)
Zombi Child is not the
slasher the name may
suggest. Rather, it is an
uncovering of the Haitian
history behind the term
‘Zombi’. The story fol-
lows Haitian earthquake
survivor Melissa as she
becomes acquainted
with the love-struck
Fanny at the elite Maison
d’éducation de la Légion
d’honneur. Alongside
the schoolgirls story we
are taken back to Haiti
in 1962 where Clairvius
Mackenson Biju is cursed,
killed and, with this being
a zombie film, I think you
can guess what happens
next...
It is rare in modern
cinema to find a picture
filmed in Haiti; the
stunning tranquillity and
vibrant passion of the
island mean that director
Bertrand Bonello’s efforts
pay off gorgeously on-
screen. Bonello’s aim
was to portray the voodoo
Haitian zombie origin, as
evidenced by his comment
at his Zombi Child Q&Aat
the London Film Festival.
Feeling, however, that it
was not within his cultural
jurisdiction to portray it
directly, he invented the
French storyline to tie it
all together. The effect
“If you are
looking for
something
without heaps
of blood for
Halloween, I
present to you
Zombi Child”
of this feels disjointed
at first, with the scenes
in Haiti playing like a
docudrama and the girls’
school scenes like a very
well-behaved version of
St Trinian’s. The decision
to straddle the two sto-
rylines finally bears fruit
in the final act where
connections between
Clarvius and the girls
begin to emerge. Some of
the film’s sense of respect
for Haiti seems to dissolve
towards the end when
clichéd Voodoo conven-
tions are used, against
which I had assumed the
movie was trying to fight.
Despite being a docu-
drama, Bonello leaves a
lot to unpack thematically.
Melissa is classified as
one of the few people
of colour in her school,
thanks to Bonello’s
ceaseless panning across
classrooms, corridors and
canteens to portray the
overwhelming white ho-
mogeneity of the all-girls
boarding school. When
Melissa then reveals her
aunt is a Mambo (Voodoo
priestess), there is a lot
less tolerance from the
other girls when she sub-
sequently starts to behave
strangely, failing to notice
the changes in Fanny.With
a Mambo as an aunty and
having lived through the
2010 Haitian earthquakes,
it seems Melissa is made
to be an abstract symbol
of 1st and 2nd generation
Hattians living in France.
Bonello is sure to show
that Melissa is able to
connect well with her
peers through their music
and pop culture, while
also being reminded by
family not to forget her
origins.
Using Bonello’s words
‘A zombie is someone
who keeps their head
down’,weseethedifferent
types of ‘zombie’ we may
encounter in day-to-day
life. Those who are living
and breathing but feel
nothing, those who are
reborn thanks to medical
advancements, and, most
blood-curdling of all, the
Zombi that were real in
Haiti decades ago. If you
are looking for something
without heaps of blood
for Halloween this year,
I present to you Zombi
Child. I can guarantee you
will leave believing that
Zombies are real.
Zombi Child is avail-
able to watch on MUBI,
an online streaming
service free for students
