T
he Hong Kong
protests have
been going on
for 4 months
now, with no end in sight.
What started as a peaceful
protest against the extra-
dition bill has evolved
(or devolved, depending
on your perspective) into
an often-violent move-
ment against Beijing.
Personally, I am both
confused, amused and
disgusted by the once
peaceful rioters.
The incident that
sparked the extradition
bill was the murder of
pregnant Poon Hiu-wing,
20, by her boyfriend
Chan Tong-kai. As crimes
committed by foreign
nationals are not punish-
able under Hong Kong
law, there arose a need
to amend this loophole.
However, Carrie Lam
(current HK Chief Execu-
tive) tried to ram the bill
through, which worsened
public sentiment and
reinforced beliefs of the
erosion of Hong Kong’s
autonomy. This sparked
the protests, as public
opinion was once again
manipulated. The origin
of the bill however, was
not unreasonable.
Furthermore, the Hong
Kong police have been
markedly restrained in the
face of blatant violence
by the protestors. In any
other country, incidents
such as violence tar-
geting policemen and
policewomen would have
resulted in martial law,
as the case was in Bal-
timore! In Hong Kong,
protestors have caused
grievous injuries such as
slashing police officers,
making bombs, doxxing
police officers (who are
Hong Kong citizens as
well) and sending death
threats to their families.
Protestors/rioters have
also tried to steal the
guns of the officers they
attacked! At this point
any country would have
declared martial law.
However, Hong Kong’s
administration is para-
lyzed. Under the central
government’s directive, it
cannot do anything, while
international media sensa-
tionalizes and demonizes
it. There has been surpris-
ingly continuous media
coverage of the protests
in Hong Kong while the
opposite has happened for
the yellow shirt protests
in Paris, where similar
violence erupted with 11
fatalities. The restraint
and conduct shown by
Hong Kong’s police is
admirable despite the
insidious tactics used by
the protestors.
I believe that the
longer the riots/protests
go on, the bleaker Hong
Kong’s future becomes.
The reason China has
not intervened yet was
because they know this.
As violence grips the city,
businesses and funds have
been considering leaving
the city. Retail sales have
been down 23% year-on-
year, tourism has been
down. Goldman Sachs
estimates that since the
protests broke out in June
about $3 billion to $4
billion has left the city
for Singapore. If this con-
tinues, within 10 years,
Hong Kong will have no
significance left. China
does not really need Hong
Kong as badly as 30 years
ago. The Shanghai stock
exchange market has now
accelerate this process.
Foreign interference in
the issues of Hong Kong
is also clear, as evidenced
by the photographs of
protest leaders with
leading Western officials
and diplomats and NED
(National Endowment
for Democracy) funding
of Hong Kong’s National
Democratic Institute. This
will only further incite
the wrath of the mainland
citizenry and government.
As an ethnic Chinese
living overseas (I am not
born in China, but I do
identify as Chinese), I
could have sympathized
with the protestors had
they not shown such
disrespect towards their
country: stamping,
burning the Chinese flag,
waving flags of the US
“In the end,
Hong Kong is
China.The very
first Article of
the Basic Law
states so...”
overtaken it, while the
Shenzhen one is catching
up fast at #8. Hong Kong
(#5) still holds an impor-
tant position in the inflow
of funds into China, but it
is by no means essential
anymore. The protestors/
rioters pushing for the
US to pass the Hong
Kong Human Rights and
Democracy Act will only
