D
ear Readers,
I bring to you
a little known
secret. Writing
in the dark of night while
someone left the Felix
closet unlocked, this
London-dwelling resident
can finally reveal it to you.
Have you been salivating
over your next piece of
chocolate, only to be
deterred by high prices
and substandard chocolate
coins? Look no further,
for I have the secret to
your salvation.
For the next two
weekends, the influx of
the nasty mini handout
bars will abate, and prices
of normal bars will come
down. NOW is the time
to buy. Halloween is over;
there are no frantic parents
looking for their child’s
next sugar high. The
horrific price gauging we
have been experiencing
for the last month is going
to see a “throwback”, if
you will, to summertime
prices for a limited time
– just until about mid
November. Why, you
ask? Well, I have 5 years
of experience shopping
through Asda, Lidl and
Tesco shelves as a teen
looking for their next
“The
supermarket
powers come
together for 3
months to gain
as much profit
as possible”
sugar hit. That means I can
tell you mid-November is
when the money-grab-
bing, holiday-profiteering
supermarkets start adver-
tising Advent calendars
(just more overpriced
chocolate that has
probably melted twice
before reaching shelves).
After the Advent calen-
dars come the price hikes
in fancy chocolate. Now,
as people visit family over
the years’ end, they tend
to be forced into buying
holiday packs, specially
designed to hold as little
chocolate as possible
while still advertising
the holiday. It appears
extracting money for
overpriced chocolate is
not exactly profitable (I’m
not buying 273 grams of
chocolate for £7!), so su-
permarkets then take the
initiative to hike up prices
for ordinary, normal
chocolate during this
season. These hiked up
prices remain throughout
the Christmas month and
through to January for the
office New Year Parties.
There is no drop in prices
despite the general resolu-
tions of “getting healthy”
and “not eat as much
chocolate”, because we
all know that Valentines’
Day is just ‘round the
corner. Now, you may
feel that Valentines’ Day
doesn’t apply to you, but
who doesn’t want choc-
olate when your mates
are getting their girls
chocolate left AND right?
Exactly.
permarket powers come
together in this glorious
3-month period to gain as
much profit as possible,
preying on the sweet
teeth of the poor student
looking to just get through
to March. If you were
me, you would already
have gotten your box of
chocolate supplies to last
you until then. If not, this
may very well be your last
chance to ensure you have
the money to be passed
out in a haze of chocolate
and sugar as Home Alone
comes on the TV and
still have heating for the
winter.
