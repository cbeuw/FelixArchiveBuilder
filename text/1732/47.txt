BOO! Did I scare you, Puzzlers? It turns out <7Across in Crossword
2> has been delayed again (So there goes a terrific word pyramid
delayed yet again), and I donâ€™t actually have a girl to ask out on a
<6Down, Crossword (2)>. Youâ€™ll be needing <nonogram> by the
looks of the pound recently! Even with such sad tidings, I bring to
you our scary masterpiece: 2 semi-scary (not really) pages of puz-
zles! Special mention to TNT and O1G, who were able to complete
the nonogram, and were awarded an extra 2 points as a result.
Weâ€™ve had a (vampire?) bat infestation here at puzzles; say hello
to Alucard who got into the printers late last night! (Hopefully Alu-
card doesnâ€™t tamper with the nonogram resolution too!)
