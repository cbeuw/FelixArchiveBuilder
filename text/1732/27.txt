Binge of the Week: Barry (Seasons 1 and 2)
Bloody BLOODY brilliant
D
espite taking
the States by
storm, Barry
has been a
pretty low-key show on
this side of the pond.
With 30 Emmy nomi-
nations, the HBO show
tells the story of Barry
(Bill Hader), a hitman
who follows his target
to an acting class in Los
Angeles, and, by some
miracle of fate, decides to
pursue acting.
An experience
Barry intertwines two
completely different
worlds beautifully, with
both developing so
smoothly and intricately.
The influence of each one
on the other is clear. They
complicate each other;
they complement each
other. These two worlds,
one of a brutal war-veter-
an-turned-hitman, Barry
Berkman, and one of the
struggling actor, Barry
Block, really sound like
two different shows at
face value, but the show
uses this to its advantage,
constantly comparing
and contrasting the two
worlds, letting them
collide, and most impor-
tantly, letting Barry make
mistakes that cause his
past to constantly catch up
with him, no matter how
hard he tries to run away.
It’s very out there, but
this approach allows it to
cover a lot of ground.
The show is hilarious
at times, but it would be
a disservice to call it a
comedy per se. It is the
journey of a man strug-
gling to make himself get
better against all odds.
Despite the absurdity,
the progression of events
is natural. Although
shocking at times, the
show makes sure that no
plot point is simply there
to act as a twist and throw
the audience off, even
though they do just that
more than occasionally.
The show takes you from
laughing out loud to
gasping for air within the
next scene.
The acting
The acting and charac-
terisations are very strong
across the board, although
there’s a few people who
go above and beyond.
“HenryWinkler
plays the
role of failed-
actor-turned-
acting-coach,
providing a lot
of comic relief”
“It’s difficult to
put Barry into
a box”
Henry Winkler plays the
role of the failed-actor-
turned-acting-coach, pro-
viding a lot of comic relief.
A lot of what he says, and
perhaps more importantly,
the way he says them are
so exceptionally funny,
yet I have no doubts that
such people really do exist
in Hollywood. However,
where Winkler deserves
the most credit is in the
scenes where his charac-
ter shows emotions. This
is rare, but beautiful as
many rare things are.
Anthony Carrigan
embodies the upbeat
Chechen gangster NoHo
Hank so perfectly that
the audience can’t help
but sympathise with
him. Sarah Goldberg
pulls off Sally, the girl-
next-door who Barry is
deeply infatuated with
exceptionally well. Sally
is so grossly unlikeable,
which is exactly what
the show needs her to be
to work. Goldberg has a
strong monologue late
into season 2 that not only
sums her character up
perfectly but also really
shows off her acting
chops.
However, the real MVP
of the show is none other
than Bill Hader, who’s
co-created, executive
produced, starred in,
co-directed and co-writ-
ten the show. Hader has a
way of pulling Barry off,
displaying the character’s
internal turmoil with
every inch of his being. It
is a strong performance,
yet it is his wonderful at-
tention to detail, subtlety
and precision as a writer
and a director that makes
the show.
Season 1 vs Season 2
The show is gripping
from the get-go.
However, I think it would
be accurate to say that
the majority of the first
season is spent setting
up the show. It is wildly
entertaining, but it is only
a hint of what’s to come in
season 2. Both seasons are
short, so I promise you’ll
get to season 2 in no time
anyway. So, sit tight and
enjoy season 1.
Overall, the second
season superior by far, as
less energy is spent into
establishing things and
more on building things
up. We find out more
about what makes Barry
himself, with flashbacks
to his military past. We
get to see what makes
him snap, what makes
him kill, and what makes
him want to stop killing.
It is all quite beautifully
profound, really.
There is a few episodes
that rise above the rest
in season two. ronny/
lily plays out a lot like a
one-take sequence and is
so bonkers that I had to
do a double-take to make
sure it wasn’t a dream
sequence. I’m still not
quite sure, but maybe
that’s the beauty of it.
The penultimate episode
of the second season,
The Audition, is, in broad
terms, everything that
makes the show great. The
season finale, berkman >
block s so incredibly bleak
and honest and real that it
was refreshing. The acting
in this episode alone by
Hader and Winkler is so
extraordinary and special.
Overall, the second season
finale is probably one of
my favourite TV episodes
of the year.
Should you watch it?
A big yes. It’s difficult
to put Barry into a box,
but that only means that
regardless of what genre
tends to rock your boat,
there is surely something
in Barry that would tickle
your fancy. Overall, Barry
is brutal, it’s grimy, it’s
smart, and it’s provoca-
tive. It’s honestly great.
The show has been
renewed for season 3,
which is expected to air
starting March 2020.
