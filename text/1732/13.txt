Protests Sparked Over Political Stagnation in Chile

O
ver the past two
weeks large
scale protests
have engulfed
Chile’s capital, Santiago,
and spread to neighbour-
ing cities. Triggered by
a now-suspended rise in
the price of metro fares in
Santiago, police brutality
has sparked further re-
sistance from the public.
Felipe Hernandez, a law
student who was gather-
ing case studies at a local
hospital, told a reporter
that “There was a jour-
nalism student who was
beaten so badly she could
not talk, or remember her
name. Her whole body
was bruised after being
kicked and clubbed.” This
is just one case of many,
with at least 470 people
suffering bullet wounds at
the hands of law enforce-
ment and over 20 fatalities
as a result. Last weekend
saw the demonstrations
peak with at least one
million people gathering
in the capital to corrobo-
rate their displeasure over
the state of Chile’s so-
cioeconomic landscape.
High healthcare costs,
inaccessible education
fees and huge disparities
in income equality were
prevalent issues addressed
on the tens of thousands
of placards displayed over
the past fotnight.
The countries attempts
to manage the demonstra-
tions with the deployment
of armed forces has been
criticised as an attempt
to quash the movement,
derived from desperation
and deep rooted structural
inequality, before it was
able to build momentum.
In reality, such actions
further polarised a country
that has been labelled
by the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation
and Development as the
most unequal country of
the world’s thirty richest
nations, with the richest
twenty percent earning
almost nine times more
than the poorest twenty
percent. The protests
haven’t been for nothing,
however, with the coun-
try’s president Sebastián
need for financial support
from economic superpow-
ers to the LEDCs who will
be affected most by the
crisis.
The problem of ine-
quality in Chile was high-
lighted over the weekend,
when it was reported
that there was a distinct
lack of availability of
medical care for people
injured in the protests
with staff blaming inad-
equate medical supplies,
including shortages in
surgical gloves, syringes
and masks in the country’s
capital. In fact, supplies
reached such a scarcity
that practitioners were
forcedtowithholdmedical
supplies from patients
who were near death
in favour of those in a
better physical condition,
according to an unnamed
healthcare worker in
Santiago. A Chilean
physician estimated that
multiple patients a week
died due to a lack of basic
equipment. One central
hospital in particular,
Posta Central, has seen
its deputy director ban

is in stark contrast to
private hospitals nearby
which were under no such
pressures.
Historically, state
welfare has been a major
issue in Chilean politics.
The privatisation of both
healthcare and pensions
occurred in the 1970s
and remained largely
unchanged until the early
2000s, during which a cen-
tre-left coalition, known
as the Concertación, intro-
duced a minimum pension
for the bottom sixty
percent of earners. The
reform, although a step
in the right direction for
many, lacked the impact
that many Chileans were
hoping for and economic
inequality has been a
persistent problem. The
country is no stranger
to political activism,
most recently due to the
unaffordable state of
“Political

Chile have

Piñera announced a
reshuffling of his cabinet
in which he will replace
eight ministers, including
interior and finance,
despite declaring that au-
thorities were ‘in a state of
war’ with protestors late
last week. There have also
been changes to the min-
istries of economy, labour
and sports. Chile also
announced on Wednesday
that it would be pulling out
of its role as host of two
international summits, in-
cluding a UN conference
on climate change, which
may be disappointing to

developed countries who
were hoping to use the
location to highlight a

education due to priva-
tisation, which spurred
student movements at the
end of the last decade.
However, political parties
in Chile have continued
business as usual without
further reform. In light
of the current unrest in
the country, it’s clear that
the people of Chile want
drastic economic reform
and improvements to a
welfare system that is
considered archaic by
many.
