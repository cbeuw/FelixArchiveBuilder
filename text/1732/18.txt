Translations – Mythical Ireland speaks the Common
Tongue
Nothing is lost, but is easy to lose yourself, in this fierce production of a play that looks at the value of a language.
D
irector Ian
Rickson’s new
production of
Brian Fiel’s
play Translations is
staging at The National
Theatre. Set in an 1833
hedge school in Baile
Beag (English: Ballybeg),
an Irish speaking commu-
nity in County Donegal,
the play explores the
lingual boundaries that
divide us and define us.
The smoky, comforting
smell of burning wood
greets us – a sign of what
is to come. A muddy,
earthen ground sprawls
across a misty stage, at
and Neil Austin to create
a convincing atmosphere.
A girl (Liadán Dunlea) is
trying to speak the simple
Irish sentence: “My
name is Sarah”. This is
a phrase that we all take
for granted, but for Sarah
this sentence holds the
key to unlocking one of
the most valuable things
in life: a connection to her
kin. According to one of
the hedge schoolteacher’s
sons Manus (Seamus
O’Hara) - it holds the key
to sharing all the secrets
that have thus far been
inaccessible in the lonely
world that is her own
mind.
Translations revolves
around the story of
the Ordnance Survey
mapping out Ireland in
1824. Lieutenant George
Yolland (Jack Bardoe) is
an orthographer on the
mission who has fallen
in love with Ireland. The
Survey documents place
names with Owen (Fra
Fee), a native, helping
George – an English
outsider who is keen to
learn the language. The
two consider the sound,
etymology, and of course
history behind a name.
Fiel’s play makes it
apparent that in Angli-
cising the place names
the essence of the places
is lost in translation. The
history of the people is
embodied in the language
that they speak and the
names that they have
chosen. Language forms a
channel to the past in the
same way that it forms a
barrier between cultures
in the present. The moun-
tains and sea that separate
England and Ireland are
mirrored in the differences
in language: the ‘contours’
of the cultural map.
Ciarán Hinds gives a
very compelling perfor-
“Translations

mance as the passionate,
yet often red-faced,
schoolmaster Hugh who
feeds his flock a diet of
Latin, Greek and Arith-
metic, but notably no
English. In his view, it is
a “plebeian” language and
poets like Wordsworth
who choose such a
base tongue to express
themselves are simply
nobodies. On this point,
one of the few things
that could be criticised is
the littering of Latin and
ancient Greek throughout
the script, that could be
confusing for some due
to the pace. However, the
nudge-nudge wink-wink
lusting after the fiery-eyed
goddess Athene described
in the verses of Jimmy
Jack Cassie (Dermot
Crowley) was hilarious.
Fra Fee as Owen gives
an outstanding portrayal
of a young man with good
intentions who comes to
terms with the true nature
of his work translating
Irish place names into
English. In particular, the
scenes with his brother
Manus have tense,
palpable undercurrents.
His loyalty gradually
grows and his discomfort
with the task he is per-
forming comes to a head
as he passionately narrates
the story behind a place
whose name is simply a
butchered Irish version of
‘Crossroads’, but whose
history involves a strange
story about a man with
warts and a well - some-
thing untranslatable.
There is also a darker
and more cynical side to
the play. When Captain
Lancey (Rufus Wright),
an unforgiving English
redcoat, forces the com-
munity to use the Angli-
cised place names, the
cast effectively portray
the image of a broken
people. Notably, Sarah,
who regresses back into
her repressed, silent state.
Dunlea’s portrayal of
the almost mute girl is a
stellar demonstration of a
performance that touches
us simply through body
language and expression.
Language can inspire
us to be who we are, but
as the play and the won-
derful cast and team so
aptly portray, it can also be
used as a tool to oppress
others and take away their
identity. Indeed, director
Rickson realises this is
not just a historical issue,
and makes it known in
stark fashion that history
may be repeating itself
in a dramatic and novel
climax that leaves us
thinking about oppression
in modern society. All in
all, a worthy play to see if
you wish to see a quality
cast and team put on an
emotional production that
will leave you thinking
much more deeply about
the role of language in
shaping the past and the
present.
