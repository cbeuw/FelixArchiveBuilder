General Election Time

I
t would be impossible
to discuss any politics
in the UK without
stumbling upon
Brexit. Brexit has been
the key political issue
of the last three years, a
problem that successive
governments have been
unable to satisfactorily
resolve.
The calling of this
election is directly linked
to the Brexit process and
will have a significant
impact on the outcome.
Boris Johnson’s gov-
ernment was formed as
a result of the leadership
election following the
resignation of Theresa
May. Theresa May’s gov-
ernment was only possible
as a result of a confidence
and supply deal (a promise
to vote with the Tories)
with the Democratic
Unionist Party, a unionist
party of Northern Ireland,
providing only a very slim
majority in Parliament.
Following Boris John-
son’s controversial stance
that a No-Deal Brexit must
be an option for the UK-
EU negotiations, Johnson
attempted to trigger an
early election twice but
failed to win the vote both
times. In the past, a British
Prime Minister was able
to dissolve Parliament at
will, effectively calling
a General Election.
However, the Fixed Term
Parliament Act of 2010
changed this. Negotiated
as a condition of the 2010
Tory-Liberal Democrat
coalition, this act was
intended to prevent
either side from being
able to bring down the
government by imposing
a requirement for a two-
thirds vote in the House of
Commons in order to call
a General Election.
Despite this, in the
ongoing negotiations with
the EU Johnson continued
to press for the No-Deal
option but was defeated
in a series of key votes,
preventing the No-Deal
scenario. These votes
were partially lost as a
result of 21 Conservative
MPs rebelling against
Johnson’s government
and subsequently being
kicked out of the party.
Some of those MPs have
now been readmitted.
A Brexit deal between
the EU and the UK has
now been agreed, which
allays the concerns of
many with regards to a
No-Deal Brexit. That
threat having subsided,
the parties that were
previously opposed to
the prospect of a new
election have approved a
UK general election for
the 12th of December.
However, the approved
‘deal’ is only a political
declaration of what a
future trading relationship
would look like, rather
than an actual binding
contract which will take
many more months to
hash out.
Each of the political
parties, Conservatives,
Labour, Liberal Demo-
crats, Greens, Brexit Party
and others are lining up
for an election that will
determine who will lead
the country over the next
five years and impose new
fiscal and social policies
on the UK. Furthermore,
Brexit will remain a key
issue with the potential for
renegotiation, or a second
referendum dependending
on the outcome of the
election.
The result of this
upcoming election will,
A general election has been called for December 12th, eligible voters should ensure they are registed to vote
The Conservatives
are hoping for a strong
election victory that
removes their dependence
on the DUP and provides
them with a sufficient
majority to enact their
economically liberal
fiscal policies as well as
achieving their hard-line
stance on the EU-UK
deal. Reduced regulation
and taxes, as well as
potentially reopening
the negotiations with
the EU with the strong
possibility of a No Deal.
This election may also be
crucial for the direction of
the Conservative party as
a whole, with a significant
victory moving it to the
right, while a loss could
lead to a revolt by the
more moderate MPs.
Conservative Labour
Labour are also aiming
for a strong election
victory, that would allow
them to enact their social-
ist fiscal policies. After
nine years in opposition
and a leadership change,
the Labour party is almost
unrecognisable from the
last time it was in power.
They will renationalise
significant parts of the
UK economy as well as
increasing taxes for some
sections of society, Labour
are also aiming to allow
a second referendum on
Brexit. The Labour party
is also vulnerable to a
change in direction, with
a loss possibly resulting in
the removal of the divisive
figure of Jeremy Corbyn.
The Liberal Demo-
crats are hoping to win
“Hundreds of seats,” by
decisively capturing the
remain vote. This remains
a key element of their
policy, with the goal of
cancelling Brexit entirely
through a second referen-
dum.
Liberal Democrats
Green
The Greens are aiming
to capitalise on the Green
Wave sweeping the world.
Increased awareness
of the environmental
movement may help the
Greens to gain a couple
more votes and enact
their programme of envi-
ronmentally and socially
conscious reforms.
Brexit
The Brexit party are
aiming for exactly that-
Brexit at all costs. They
could be said to match or
exceed the Conservative
party’s aims when it
comes to socially and eco-
nomically conservative
reforms.
SNP
The SNP are aiming
for a strong election result
North of the border in
order to provide impetus
for a second Independence
Referendum. This is likely
to hinge on the likelihood
of a No-Deal Brexit and
the probability of an
unpopular Conservative
government in London.
Other smaller parties
will of course also be
fighting for seats across
the country. While their
agendas might not feature
