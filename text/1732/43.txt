W
hen you
think of the
RCSU, you
p r o b a b l y
picture the amazing events
we run, all of the free
condoms we give out, and
the Facebook posts about
people stealing some
really heavy things from
other Constituent Unions
and for some inconceiva-
ble reason having a lot of
fun doing that. Many of
you might not realise that
your Year Reps and Dep
Reps are also a crucial part
of the RCSU - we oversee
both the Academic and
Wellbeing Representation
Networks and coordinate
representation in all
four Natural Sciences
departments.
As the head of the
Academic Representation
Network I was excited to
meet most of our 24 new
academic year reps this
Thursday during our Rep
Welcome event (at the
time of writing this had
not taken place yet, but I
am already certain it will
be a blast). Our reps are
one of the most important
students are heard. You
hopefully already know
who your reps are, but if
you don’t, next week will
be your chance to meet
them!
Talking to your reps
throughout the year is
important and giving
them feedback doesn’t
have to be limited to
surveys. A brief chat to
your rep about what you
think could be improved
can go a long way. Based
on student comments,
student reps can ask lec-
turers to adapt their lectur-
ing style (is the writing on
the board too small? Does
the lecturer use too many
PowerPoints? Is the pace
too fast? Tell your rep!) or
lobby the department to
make significant changes
to labs, lecture courses,
or the way tutorials are
run. Talking to your reps
directly is more effective
than waiting until SOLE
or the NSS comes out
because by then it might
be too late for you to
feel the impact of any
improvements.

H
ey everyone,
hope you’ve all
been having a
good time since
my last column. This
week I’ve got a brief sum-
mary of the events we’ll
be running in November!
RSMU Bar Night
(07/11/19)
Our second annual Bar
Night, we’re once again
hiring out the Union Bar
for a night of fancy dress,
traditions and fun! This
time the theme is ‘Once
Upon a Time’, so bust out
your best public-domain
fairy-tale costumes and
have a good time! As well
as yards, we’ll also have a
variety of other forms of
entertainment available,
as well as prizes for the
best costumes. 7pm,
Union Bar
MasterMines
(21/11/19)
Next up is the fantas-
tically named ‘Master-
Mines’ quiz! Returning
for its second year, this
quiz pits teams of students
and staff from both
departments against one
other for a range of prizes.
There’ll be common
rounds like music and pop
culture, alongside more
specialised Imperial-cen-
tric rounds like earth
science, materials, and
RSM trivia, so be sure to
come along! 6pm, RSM
G01
RSMA Dinner
(22/11/19)
This annual highlight
brings together current
and former RSMU
students. Hosted by the
Royal School of Mines
Association, this dinner is
always a highlight, with
good food, good company
and good speeches (and
maybe even a song or
two…). It’s open to
all students but geared
towards third and fourth
years, and tickets are
available now! 7pm,
Rembrandt Hotel
RSMU Ice Skating
Finishing off another
month at the RSMU, we’ll
be heading down to the
Natural History Museum
for a session of ice skating.
Tickets include a session
on the rink and a hot drink
after, so be sure to join us
at this festive event! Time
TBD, NHM Ice Rink
That’s all we’ve got
planned – our DepSocs
and sports clubs will also
be running events and
training sessions through-
out the month (why not
come to RSM Lacrosse
training, Mondays at 12 in
Hyde Park – not so subtle
plug)!
