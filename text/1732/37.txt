ost foods
are simple
- some
ingredients
grow on trees, bushes
or in fields, others are
taken from animals,
and depending on their
nutritional value, undergo
some level of processing.
But with the modern era
comes change, and as sci-
ence is increasingly being
installed in the kitchen
(food science is even a
discipline in its own right
– petition for Imperial to
introduce it as a degree?
Stay tuned), we’ve chosen
to unravel the science
behind 5 interesting ex-
amples below.
Astronaut/space
food
Granted, this may not
be the most commonly
consumed product on the
list, but perhaps you’ve
wondered about it never-
theless. Food taken into
space must fit multiple
criteria: be compact, have
a light mass and of course
a high nutritional benefit,
all while being preserva-
ble for a long time period
and consumable in a
weightless environment.
Freeze-drying, or lyoph-
ilisation, solves most
of these problems, and
even causes less damage
than other dehydration
methods that use higher
temperatures. The product
may be pre-treated by
revising the formula or
concentrating the product
inpreparationforfreezing.
Next comes the freezing
stage, during which the
material is cooled below
its triple point (the lowest
point at which the solid,
liquid, and gas phases can
coexist) in a rapid manner
to avoid the formation of
large ice crystals, which
can result in poor texture
and loss of nutritional
value. Finally, drying
occurs in 2 phases: the
primary phase, which
involves lowering the
pressure to a few millibars
using a partial vacuum
and supplying heat to
cause sublimation of the
ice, and the secondary
phase, which aims to
remove unfrozen water
molecules by using higher
temperatures than the
previous step. This results
in a light, crumbly food
that can easily be restored
by rehydration with water,
“The material
is cooled below
its triple point
(...) to avoid the
formation of
large ice crystals”
“(...) fruit juices or
herbal infusions,
are mixed with
a stabilising
surfactant such
as lecithin or
monoglycerides”
filling the microscopic
pores caused by the pro-
cedure.
Nitrogen ice cream
Not only used for
making ice cream,
but certainly the most
delicious way to enjoy
nitrogen (welcome to
2019, where we apparent-
ly enjoy consuming the
elements of Group 15), so
what’s the secret? Simple:
a standard ice cream mix
is made, and then liquid
N2 is poured in. The tem-
perature of liquid nitrogen
is -196 degrees Celsius, so
the ice cream is frozen ex-
tremely rapidly and no ice
crystals are formed - re-
sulting in a highly creamy
texture (and definitely a
much cooler ice cream
to brag about). However,
if not fully evaporated,
liquid nitrogen can create
solid, brittle, glass-like
shards, so be wary of any
sketchy-looking offers for
this treat.
Popping boba
Finally, something
you’re likely to have tried
in your lifetime. No idea
what I’m talking about?
Two words: bubble tea
(although popping boba
have also been used as
frozen yoghurt or ice
cream toppings, so hey,
boba lovers rejoice). If
you’ve ever ventured
beyond the classic milk
bubble tea with tapioca
pearls, you might have
even had bubble tea with
popping boba. Flavoured,
usually fruit juice-resem-
bling liquids are thorough-
ly mixed with powdered
sodium alginate, and then,
drop by drop, dripped into
a bowl filled with cold
calcium chloride, creating
small spheres which
we know as boba. The
magic lies in the calcium
solution which forms the
thin, flexible skin of the
boba, and results in that
delightful juicy POP.
Edible foam
We’ve gone through the
not relatable, uncommon
and basic, so now it’s
time for a little more class
with this Michelin-level
molecular gastronomy. To
understand the creation of
culinary foam, let’s take
a look at its composition:
2 phases (aqueous and
gaseous), with a thin film
at their interface in which
large amounts of gas
bubbles are essentially
trapped - in this way
similar to an emulsion of
fat and liquid. To generate
this, natural flavours,
such as fruit juices, stock,
or herbal infusions, are
mixed with a stabilising
surfactant, such as lecithin
or monoglycerides, in
order to reduce the inter-
facial tension between
the aqueous and gaseous
phases of the components
and facilitate molecule
adherence. Without this,
the forces of liquid and air
within the bubbles would
counteract, rupturing the
bubbles and causing the
foam to disintegrate. A
mechanical force, usually
whipping, is then applied
in order to introduce
air into the mixture and
create the aforementioned
bubbles. A network of
interconnected films
between bubbles, known
as lamellae (no, not lamel-
lipods biologists… but
close enough I guess?), is
what gives culinary foam
its relative stability.
Candyfloss
If you’ve never had
candyfloss/cotton candy/
barbe à papa/fairy floss/
insert term for that fluffy
pink sugary goodness
here, have you even had
a childhood? Anyway…
let’s keep this one short
and sweet. First, specially
flavoured solid sugar
is placed into a small
bowl, melted using a
heating element, and then
squeezed out through tiny
holes into a larger vessel
by centrifugal force (yes,
centrifuges are not only
for RNA extraction). The
miniscule holes result in
extremely thin threads of
sugar, while the instanta-
neous increase in surface
area and exposure to
cooler air means that when
they emerge on the other
side, they are already so-
lidified. All that’s left now
is for the machine operator
to gather the sugary
strands into portions,
and your horribly-sticky
-yet-delightful-sugar-co-
ma-childhood-memo-
ry-concoction is ready to
consume.
If anyone ever told you
that science isn’t cool, let
them live without. More
boba for us.
