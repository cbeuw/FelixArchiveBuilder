California Fires puts pressure on the US to improve
Environmental policies
F
or the past week,
statewide wild-
fires in California
have been
blazing, having turned to
ashes more than 80 000
acres, most in the counties
of Sonoma and LA. The
biggest fire is the Kincade
Fire in the North of
California. As of now, the
fire is only 15% contained
and has burned at least 74
000 acres, leaving more
than a million citizens
without electricity or
service.
Nearly 200 000 people
have been ordered to
leave their homes, while
an astonishing 4000 fire-
fighters are battling the
flames. Fire department
representative Jonathan
Cox says it could take
“weeks, if not months” to
extinguish the fires fully.
It is becoming more
and more evident that the
frequency and intensity
of these fires are highly
linked to climate change,
more specifically they are
linked to wind and soil
conditions.
Indeed, climate change
has led to an average
increase of 3 degrees
Fahrenheit for this time
of year in California.
This signifies hotter
winds during wildfire
season and drier soils.
The combination proves
to have immeasurable
impacts on the number,
size and power of the
fires; 15 of the 20 largest
fires in California history
have happened since 2000
and the area burned has
increased by 500%.
The current climate
trends could signify a
longer wildfire season.
However, generally, it is
uncertain what climate
change will mean for the
future. The fires may be
less frequent, according to
a study by Guzman-Mo-
rales and Gershunov from
January 2019.
With powerful natural
disasters increasing not
only in rate but also in
proximity to large cities,
will the US rethink its
current Climate plan?
The country’s Presi-
dent seems set to leave
the Paris agreement as
soon as possible; his
administration is said to
be beginning the official
withdrawal from the Paris
accords on November
the 4th. As the fires will
undoubtedly have effects
on the country’s economy
as well as Californians
health and way of life,
politicians, institutions
and major companies are
retaliating by installing
acts and encouraging the
citizens to take action,
despite the White House’s
agenda.
For them, the fires have
sparked new conversa-
tions on current and future
plans to decrease carbon
emissions. For instance,
democratic congress-
woman Alexandria Oca-
sio-Cortez has been very
active on twitter to remind
the people to act quickly
before the consequences
of climate change become
irreversible. “This is what
climate change looks
like,” she wrote of a photo
of the fire. “We have
10 years to cut carbon
emissions in half. If we
don’t, scenes like this
I
t’s the time of the
year for trick or treat-
ing! However, being
festive does not mean
we should pollute and
bring damage to our be-
loved planet.. Halloween
activities can be incredi-
bly wasteful, so here is a
look at three ways we can
make Halloween more
sustainable.
Costumes
Halloween is the peak
time for fast fashion, the
clothes bought are likely
only worn once before it
is discarded, or never used
again. This uses us a huge
amount of resources, and
the waste will end up in
landfills. Instead, you can
consider making your own
costumes from old fabrics
and clothes you no longer
wear. DIY is both fun and
rewarding, your costumes
will impress your friends
even more when you tell
them you made it yourself.
Upcycling is a great way
to help the environment.
Pumpkins
Waste of pumpkins is
predicted to be the highest
ever this year, with eight
million pumpkins being
dumped. Food waste is
already huge problem
in the UK, and there are
ways to target pumpkin
waste. When you carve
out the pumpkin, you
can use the insides in
many creative ways, for
example, you can bake it
into desserts or make soup
with it. The seeds can be
toasted, and it makes a
wonderful garnish. The
main part of the pumpkin
is versatile too, you can
bake it or cook it into a
curry. The possibilities are
endless, get creative.
Candies
The big brands for sweets
such as Nestlé, Mars and
Hershey, and all their
subunits, are known for
their unsustainable and
unethical practices. They
use huge amounts of

can get much worse.”.
She continues to strive
for the acceptance of a
Green New Deal - legis-
lation centered around
sustainability, focusing on
tackling climate change
and fixing the current
economic inequality.
States are trying to
adopt legislation to
transition to cleaner
energy sources, but the
deadlines remain distant.
For example, the 9 states
making up 16% of the
US’s electricity demand,
including California,
Washington and Nevada
have enacted 100% clean
energy legislation with
targets between 2040 and
2050. To decrease carbon
emissions, California is
inspiring other states to
join their zero-emission
vehicle (ZEV) mandate
requiring automakers to
sell electric vehicles.
There is also a notable
increase of commitments
from cities: since 2017,
80 cities have committed
to 100% renewables.
Finally, two major
energy companies, Xcel
Energy and National Grid,
have aimed to dramati-
cally reduce carbon use.
Xcel, for example, plans
to go 100% coal free by
2030 and 100% carbon
free by 2050.
There has been some
pushback from the admin-
istration against most of
the acts put into place. For
instance, they are trying
to revoke the changes that
California had made on
the Clean Air Act to make
it stricter. Nonetheless, the
general consensus from
Americans is positive:
71% say they want the
federal government to do
more on climate change,
while 67% say it will have
a positive impact on the
economy and jobs.
This year, after the
major wildfires in the
Amazon, 230 institutional
investors raised USD
$16.2 trillion in assets.
As the California fires are
expected to grow during
the week, will they play a
role in moving the dead-
lines for climate action
and increasing funds? One
thing is sure, if we want
to act before it is too late,
we must continue to make
changes in the courtroom
as well as in households,
and we must make them
now.
