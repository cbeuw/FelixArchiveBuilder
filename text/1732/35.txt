E x c h a n g e
market (Forex
or FX) is an
over-the-counter market
in currency-pairs which is
the largest and most liquid
market in the world. An
average of $5.1 trillion
is traded every day, com-
pared to $84 billion traded
daily in equities’ markets.
Dollar, Euro, Sterling and all their friends:
markets. The first is to
benefit from yields of
different currencies. The
central bank of each
currency will usually set
a base interest rate, which
strongly determines
the interest generated
by saving in a money
account of that currency.
For instance, if the UK
were to raise interest
rates tomorrow from the
current 1.75% to 2.25%,
then this would make
saving in a UK-based
money account far
more attractive, and so
investors would rush to
buy sterling and take
advantage of this, which
would increase the
strength of the sterling..
This opportunity is the
real money maker of
the currency exchange
markets – it allows spec-
ulators to move money
to a currency which they
expect to pay a higher rate
of interest. Additionally,
currencies are bought
and sold for so-called
‘carry trades’ – hoping to
profit off an increase in
the value of a particular
currency.
To determine whether a
currency is overvalued
cheaper labour costs in
poorer countries.
The other reason that
trading the currency
markets is so profitable
is that a high level of
leverage is available, up
to a magnitude of about
100:1. For instance, if
you had £100 to invest in
Japanese Yen, you could
borrow up to £9990,
and then invest £10,000
in Yen. This hugely
amplifies the profits
and losses which can
be made through Forex
trading; huge returns
can be achieved from a
small amount of starting
capital. Moreover, the
interest rates charged on
such instruments from
multinational companies.
A peculiarity of the
foreign exchange market
is that it is very lightly
regulated, with none of
the clearing houses or
regulatory institutions
characterising other
markets. Instead, trades
take place off the back
of credit agreements,
essentially metaphorical
handshakes. There is
no such thing as insider
trading in foreign
exchange markets, it’s
legitimate to trade off any
information you happen
to hold about countries
and governments.
Role of world politics
The foreign exchange
market is also interesting
because of how strongly
it is affected by a range
of macro-economic
factors. For instance,
the trade war between
China and the US led to
the dollar strengthening
against the yuan. This
is because of the two
countries, America is a
net importer of Chinese
goods. The tariffs on
these goods mean that
less will be bought, and
so the demand for the
yuan is decreased. Thus,
or undervalued, forex
traders will sometimes
use the notion of pur-
chasing power parity.
This expresses a measure
of what the exchange
rate ‘should’ be based on
the ratio of the cost of a
basket of goods in two
different countries. In
the long run, exchange
rates are expected to
move towards rates
which equalise the price
of a basket of identical
goods and services in any
country. An entertaining
simplification of this
model is the Big Mac
index, which compares
the cost of a Big Mac in
hundreds of countries,
adjusted for GDP to
account for the effect of

Like how you might trade
in sterling for euros before
a trip abroad, large banks
the yuan depreciates
in value against the
dollar (it can also be
interpreted as the dollar
strengthening against
the yuan). It is worth
noting that the effect of
the base interest rate on
the value of a currency
is not so straightforward.
A low interest rate spurs
consumer confidence and
and corporations trade
currencies. They do this
both to hedge against
international currency
and interest rate risks, as
well as to speculate on
geopolitical events and
diversify portfolios. The
most common currency
pairs traded on the FX
markets are Dollar-Euro,
Dollar-Yen, and Dollar-
Sterling. Additionally,
popular currencies are
the Swiss Franc, the
Australian Dollar and the
New Zealand Dollar. Note
that only floating curren-
cies are traded, not fixed
currencies.
There are two main ways
to make money from
the foreign exchange

foreign exchange trans-
actions for large banks
and institutions are negli-
gible, due to the size and
liquidity of the market.
Aside from the straight-
forward spot price on
foreign exchange rates,
an eclectic zoo of FX de-
rivatives exists to hedge
against, and speculate
off, currency risk.
The regulators
Until 1976, foreign
exchange rates had
been governed by the
1944 Bretton Woods
Agreement between the
U.S., Canada, Western
European countries,
Australia and Japan.
This bound each country
to keep its country’s
exchange rate to within
1% by tying its value
to the value of gold and
using the IMF to settle
temporary imbalance of
payments. The Jamaica
Agreement tore down the
Bretton Woods Agree-
ment, increasing the
instability of the financial
markets for investors, and
necessitatingtheadoption
of financial derivatives
to hedge against this
new risk. Moreover, the
advent of globalisation
increased the demand for

growth, which is general-
ly positive for the value
of the currency. However,
this is balanced by higher
interest rates generating
foreign investment in
a country, increasing
demand for the currency
and thus it’s strength.
