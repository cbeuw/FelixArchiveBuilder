T
he first thing
to capture your
attention when
entering the
theatre is the great mirror
which extends above the
stage. The reflective struc-
ture is only one of many
creative tools present in
this production through
which the main charac-
ter’s unique story-telling
is done. The minimal
but effective set design
includes the use of salt
to distinguish different
mindset introduce a
humorous aspect and keep
the audience engaged
with the story. In addition,
the unexpected responses
of her family and friends
to the obstacles they face
show the spontaneous and
human side of their char-
acter. The contrast allows
the audience to explore
the situation from a fresh
perspective.
Nevertheless, what
most stand out are the
emotional bonds between
Susie and her loved ones.
The characters on earth
deal with nostalgia and
saudade while being
forced to let go of the
past. Meanwhile, from
heaven, Susie guides her
family to who her assassin
is, as a way to move on
herself. The few scenes
where Susie manages
to cross the boundary
portray the characters’
suffering intensely and
emphasize the feeling
of helplessness as they
let out a cry of rage and
agony. Even as onlookers,
we connect with them at
a personal level and find
ourselves identifying with
the emotions of various
characters. Out of the cast
Charlotte Beaumont gives
a particularly moving
performance as the main
character Susie, with
Catrin Aaron and Leigh
Lothian also delivering
poignant performances as
Susie’s mother and class-
mate respectively.

A
ccording to
Greek myth,
Orpheus loses
his lover,
Eurydice, and laments so
painfully for her that the
gods themselves weep and
help him on the terrible
quest to reclaim Eurydice
from the underworld.
This tale of longing
and devastation was the
source of inspiration for
playwright, Zinnie Harris,
when writing Meet Me At
Dawn. Harris explores the
pressures and tribulations
of grief through the char-
acters of Robyn (Marianne
Oldham) and Helen
(Jessica Hardwick) who
wash up on an unknown
shore following a violent
boating accident. In only
an hour of performance,
we share in the shock,
fear and love of these two
women. However, the
performance definitely
plays out in a crescendo,
building not only in
drama, but also quality.
I found that the first
portion of the script-
particularly in the case
of Robyn- was clutching
at profoundness. This
dialogue appeared forced
and out of place. It is clear
to Orpheus and Eurydice
becomes clear.
Realising the true
extent of their misfortune,
Robyn and Helen turn on
each other. The confron-
tation is driven by a fear
of death, projected anger
and lost time. Oldham
and Hardwick deliver a
convincing and emotive
performance; the sheer
fury of the women horri-
fies. During the exchange,
all ambient noise has
ceased, only adding to
the intensity of the scene.
Thankfully, the well-
placed organic humour
remains throughout, and
this is a true testament to
the bond between the two
lovers.
Robyn and Helen are
typical, mundane and
wonderful characters; the
actresses themselves are
truly stunning in their
roles. Helen is excitable,
insatiable and full of life.
Hardwick endears her to
us as an audience with her
positivity and pure talent.
Robyn is far more serious
and anxious, the sensible
one of the pair but Oldham
conveys her adoration of
Helen so sincerely.
The jewel of the play
comes when Robyn asks
for too much, losing
her soulmate as a result.
Oldham expresses her
sorrow and agony with
a haunting display of
emotion. She is nothing
short of exceptional and
many in the audience-
including myself- were
moved almost to tears.
Following Robyn’s break-
down, Helen returns to her
for a final few moments
together. The soft flame
she brings between them
provides contrast to the
stress just before. The
couple are calm and ac-
cepting, content together.
This touching ending
leaves the audience with
a real appreciation of life
and love.
Meet Me At Dawn is
a testament to human
emotion and a showcase
of raw talent. The begin-
ning may leave much to
be desired but the scenes
to follow more than make
up for it.

Salmon, a fourteen-year-

about life on earth after her

These two distinct worlds
