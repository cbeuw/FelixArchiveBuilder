POV: Cytus 2: Electric Boogaloo
H
ey all! This
week I have
been doing
something a bit
different: I have been re-
ligiously playing a mobile
game! Now before you
pull out the torches and
pitch-forks, hear me out!
Cytus 2, released January
2018, is a rhythm game
developed by Rayark Inc.
This game did not seem
like much to me at first
but once I started playing
I was instantly hooked.
It is relatively simple but
quickly ramps up in diffi-
culty until you are playing
at speeds you didn’t even
think were possible. The
gameplay involves a line
which rises and falls on
the screen in time with the
music. When the line goes
over a circle, you press the
circle. There are notes that
you hold, notes you drag
and on the hardest diffi-
culty some notes that you
swipe (surprisingly hard
at a fast pace). The feeling
is extremely fluid, once
you get into the rhythm
it becomes second nature
and is so satisfying. It
can be frustrating playing
very high difficulty songs
but with the difficulty
ranging from 1 to 15,
there is a lot of option to
choose exactly what pace
is good for you. I am now
up to the stage of playing
level 14 songs and I still
have not got bored.
The game is packed
full of original music,
with each playable char-
acter having a distinct
style, from Dubstep to
Heavy Metal to Jazz.
You start the game with
5 characters and must pay
£10 to unlock each new
character. This seems a bit
obscene but I have nearly
100 hours in the game and
have not spent a single
penny yet. That’s right,
the game is free!
Cytus 2 shines in its
gameplay, but the story
and art style compliments
it so well that it must be
mentioned too. The story
is told through a fictional
social media where
people not only message
and post different stories
but also perform virtual
reality concerts. It starts
harmless enough but
quickly devolves into a
very dark and twisted
futuristic psychological
mystery. The character
designs are also top-notch
with the beautiful pastel
shades complimenting
play by not being too
hard on the eyes. Anyone
that likes rhythm games
such as Osu or TapTap
Revenge should check
this out. Enjoy your week
and I will see you all next
Friday!
POV: The Ingenuity of the Emulation Community
T
his POV is
dedicated to the
breathtaking (cue
Keanu Reeves)
community of coders that
make emulation possible.
For those unfamiliar with
the term, video game
emulation is the practice
of running or simulating
games on machines that
they’re not meant to be
running on – for example
running Nintendo Game
Boy Advance Games on
an iPhone or PS1 games
on a Nintendo Switch. In
other words, emulation is
the mighty techno-sledge-
hammer that knocks
down the barriers be-
tween gaming platforms,
providing jailbroken con-
soles – consoles that have
had their base code edited
– with the ability to play
any type of game. I’ve
been giving it a go with
a PS Vita that has been
completely kitted out with
an emulator system called
Retroarch, allowing me
to play a digital version
of every single Gameboy
Advance game I own.
The zanier end of
the hobby is putting
emulators on not only
different consoles, but
also household applianc-
es – oh yeah, I’m talking
about the running “can
it run DOOM” joke. The
iconic shooter has become
a benchmark for how far
gamers will go to ensure
the continuation and pres-
ervation of their dearest
memes. As a result, I’d
dare to say that with every
piece of new technology
comes greater potential
for DOOM memery! If
there’s a digital interface,
it can run DOOM. It’s
been emulated on ATMs,
The Touch Bar of a
Macbook Pro, and even
calculators. Just like the
game’s protagonist, this
joke is too angry and
persistent to die.
However, for all the
pleasantries that I as-
sociate with emulation
there can also be some
shady stuff – in particular,
viruses. So, so many
viruses. This especially
applies when download-
ing ROMs, which are
the files that contain the
information needed to run
the game. There are also
concerns with piracy, as
one can download ROMs
for games they don’t own,
and the risk of bricking
your console while jail-
breaking.
In short, video game
emulation is a blessing.
However, it is strongly
advised that you research
it thoroughly before
getting started! For those
interested in kitting out
consoles or even your
computer with the ability
to emulate old classics,
there are a plethora of
guides online.
