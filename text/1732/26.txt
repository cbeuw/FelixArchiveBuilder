BC’s recent
crime thriller
The Capture
presents an in-
triguing case of how tech-

case, facial recognition
and deepfakes, accelerate
surveillance and threaten
our privacy and integrity
in the modern world. It
begins with a string of
seemingly unexplainable
events slowly unveiling
piece-by-piece with a plot

you questioning, “Can we

The backstory
Ex-soldier Shaun
Emery (played by Callum
Turner), formerly accused
of a war crime in Afghan-
istan, has been acquitted
due to the video evidence
that has been deemed
faulty. In the midst of cel-
ebration, Emery accompa-
nies his barrister Hannah
Roberts (played by Laura
Haddock) to the bus stop
with Roberts heading off
on the bus. But the CCTV
footage says otherwise,
with Emery appearing
to physically attack
and kidnap Roberts. DI
Rachel Carey (played
by Holliday Grainger) is
assigned the case, who
goes on to identify Emery
via facial recognition and
arrest him. With Rob-
erts’s disappearance and
eventual death, CCTV re-

cordings inconsistent with
the truth, the emergence
of a third party equally
invested in the mystery,
DI Carey has to plough
through layers of facade
before she uncovers the
truth.
Surveillance and“deep-
fakes”
Big Brother is watching
you. This is not only the
truth in George Orwell’s
1984 but also in The
Capture, where as a
suspect your every move
is being watched, your
phone calls listened to,
your locations tracked.
One key conflict centers
around the fact that sur-
veilled content is consid-
ered inadmissible in court,
which is used to justify
the approach of “correc-
tion,” where footages are
falsely altered to convict
suspects. It is truly ironic
that The Capture begins
with the discharge of a
criminal (whom we later
found out did commit the
crime) and ends with an
innocent man taken into
custody, both on the basis
of faulty video evidence.
Consider this: CCTV
evidence is often per-
ceived as one of the most
trusted, objective source.
With the introduction of
“deepfakes,” where one’s
image is superimposed
onto a source material
with machine learning,
has video evidence lost its
objectivity it once had?
Does the end ever
justify the means?
Widely explored in
media, famously in 12
Angry Men, the pre-
sumption of innocence
serves as the basis of our
system of justice and is a
legal right of the accused
in a trial. This is another
theme echoing throughout
the story and serves as
the primary motivator
for Roberts, plotting to
expose the practice of cor-
rection in the intelligence
world. In The Capture,
Roberts, a human rights
lawyer, seeks to defend
her Islamist client Faisal
Dahmani who was taken
into custody based on
altered footage proving
Dahmani a terrorist.
The intelligence service
thinks otherwise based on
wiretaps and intercepts
that are inadmissible
in court and falsifies
CCTV footage to convict
Dahmani. Here we are
forced to ask, do the
ends justify the means?
The service claims to
save thousands of lives
removing terrorist threats
as such. Does prioritising
the so-called safety justify
the violation of privacy?
Does it justify falsifying
evidence? Does it justify
one’s life, one’s integrity,
one’s innocence? We have
a clear answer, but who is
there to ask the question
and make the decision is
the uneasy truth we have
to face.
Controversial ending
Whilst many find the
open-ended ending to be
disappointing, claiming
it “messy” and “untidy,”
I find it rather satisfying,
realistic, and thought-pro-
voking. Although I have
a preference for the
typical happily-ever-after
endings or at least one
where justice is served,
I have to admit Ben
Chanan’s conclusion
to the multi-layered
conspiracy wraps up the
series well, leaving room
for the audience to decide
for themselves between
the dichotomy of human
rights or lives, rather than
forcefully imposing an
opinion or the other.
Final thoughts
Allinall,Iwouldwhole-
heartedly recommend
this conspiracy thriller
to anyone, especially to
thriller enthusiasts like
myself. It’s a quest after
truth and fairness; it sheds
light on numerous contro-
versial topics yet covers
each with such depth and
thoughtfulness. Everyone
stands with their own
versions of truths, but
how do we know that the
truth is indeed the truth?
