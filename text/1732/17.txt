Hogarth After Hours – A Rushed Masterpiece
O
n a cold and
slightly wet
O c t o b e r
Friday night, I
made my way to the Sir
John Soane Museum in
Holborn. Located in the
late John Soane’s house,
the museum is a rabbit
warren of impressively
decorated rooms and
secret cupboards; mirrors,
artwork and sculpture line
every wall and surface.
Look out for the compass
directions on the walls,
they might help you find
your way out again! I
would recommend visit-
ing just to see the house,
but that’s not why I was
there. The museum has
temporarily expanded
its already significant
William Hogarth collec-
tion with pieces on loan
from the National Gallery
and private collections to
create a complete collec-
tion of Hogarth’s series.
For those not familiar
with Hogarth’s work, he
is said to be the father of
comics. A strongly busi-
ness-minded man, he used
the power of the printing
press (and the introduc-
tion of copyright laws
on images) to sell a vast
number of images from
his ‘series’. These were
paintings (usually two or
more and reproduced as
etching prints) that follow
the downward spiral of a
character’s life typically
ending in syphilis or
death. Intrigued by the
immorality of humans,
Hogarth’s works, whilst
impressive and fascinat-
ing, are rarely cheery. His
one major attempt at a
positive series ‘A happy
marriage’ lies unfinished,
possibly out of boredom.
Visiting the works
as part of the Soane’s
museums late’s is a vastly
different experience to ex-
ploring them on your own
on a Saturday afternoon.
The tour begins with the
sophistication of a gin
and tonic accompanied by
a short introductory talk
from our passionate and
clearly knowledgeable
guide. A prior knowledge
of the artist is not required
as she lead us through
the stories of Hogarth as
a man and the inspiration
behind the creation of his
series; by the time I left
the room to start viewing
the artworks, I felt I might
be as much in love with
Hogarth as she is.
Guiding you through
the house, the tour stops
at each of the series on
display with the guide
explaining the story and
pointing out interesting,
and frequently humorous
aspects of the paintings
and prints I wouldn’t have
spotted otherwise. For
example Hogarth’s ob-
session with immorality
and chaos is ever present
in each work in the
backdrop, such as in the
destruction of buildings
or furniture, or even just
the presence of something
upturned.
The culture in which
the series were painted is
integral to their message,
so I was grateful to
receive contextual
commentary from our
guide and not be solely
dependent on reading the
placards. I particularly
enjoyed learning that he
felt ‘The Four stages of
cruelty’ was so important
he needed to make it more
accessible by producing a
cheaper wooden print to
sell to medical students.
His relation with his
audience seemed sincere
and involved, ‘Marriage
a-la-mode’was a response
to criticism that his paint-
work observations spared
the rich.
Unfortunately, the flow
of the tour was impeded by
the logistical errors on the
museum’s part. Moving
around the house in a
group of 15-20 it was im-
possible for us all to look
at one artwork at the same
time so often you couldn’t
see what the guide was so
wonderfully explaining.
In addition, we were end-
lessly rushed from each
room to make way for the
following group meaning
we often didn’t have time
to properly appreciate the
works. But despite all this
Hogarth won out and I
know I’ll be going back to
appreciate his creativity at
my own leisure.
