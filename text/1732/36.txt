Automation & Virtual Assistants
Finding Shortcuts to Daily Life Tasks

“We’re waking
up to an
increasingly
internet-
connected
world each
day.”
T
he past decade
has seen the rise
of digital virtual
assistants and
a big boom in the home
automation industry. If
you’ve seen the movies
“Flubber” (1997) or
“Chitty Chitty Bang
Bang” (1968), you’ll
know what I’m talking
about; from machines that
cook you a breakfast meal
to a virtual assistant that
develops an intimate re-
lationship with its creator,
these movies represented
an over-optimistic view of
where humanity’s future
was headed. Yet, here we
are, more than a decade
later, with lightbulbs
that change colours with
voice commands and
virtual assistants that
have limited contextual
awareness. It’s not to say
that we haven’t lived up
to the expectations of the
filmmakers and audiences
of old. It’s just that today’s
world puts forward chal-
lenges related to safety
and privacy that makes
the development and dis-
tribution of these products
challenging.
Today’s assistants
represent a step towards
a future of managing
to make calls to book a
table at a restaurant or an
appointment at a salon on
your behalf, it’s currently
the most capable in terms
of speech recognition and
conversational awareness.
While these capabilities
are ‘scarily’ good, it
certainly is a step toward
our surrender to the robot
overlords. Just kidding
- in reality, it’s a step
toward better assistants
throughout the industry
as competition pushes
innovation forward.
Google has access to huge
custom-curated datasets
for backend algorithms
to train and learn from,
so it’s no surprise that
their assistant is far ahead.
Other assistants, although
not as “smart” as Google’s
implementation, make use
of extensions to expand
their capabilities; Amazon
does this with Alexa
skills, and Apple with Siri
Shortcuts. However, these
companies are heavily
focused on pushing
research that make these
systems more capable for
human interaction.
Coming to home auto-
mation, virtual assistants
are integrated into smart-
home speakers that act
as central hubs for other
internet-connected, smart-
home devices such as
lightbulbs, power sockets,
thermostats, security
cameras, or door locks.
These devices are aimed
at easing the ‘pressure’
on managing our daily
lifestyle; in other words,
they automate tasks and
make living convenient.
Basically, all devices con-
nected to a central hub can
be either controlled with
your voice or through a
connected smartphone.
Most smart-speakers,
except Apple’s HomePod
and the Sonos One, focus
less on audio quality.
Rather, their main
purpose is to serve as a
‘voice box’ of sorts for
the virtual assistants they
house. Another category
of central hubs include
smart-hubs, which slap
a touch-screen display
on a smart-speaker for
additional information.
With a slowly increasing
demand and market for
these internet-connected
smart devices, companies
are continually supporting
and expanding a wide
range of products catered
to smart-living.
On the digital auto-
mation side, Apple’s
Shortcuts app takes an
interesting approach to
expanding the capabilities
of Siri. Shortcuts are
drag-and-drop scripts that
have a logical flow similar
to that of a flowchart and
almost act as a program-
ming language with the
capability to manipulate
data from different apps
to automate tasks. These
shortcuts can then be trig-
gered manually, through
voice commands with Siri
or with NFC tags. Another
platform is IFTTT (IF
This Then That), which
doesn’t have a set focus on
virtual assistants but has a
similar approach to Siri
Shortcuts by connecting
different apps and frame-
works. The potential of
these platforms in helping
towards accomplishing
daily life tasks are literally
endless. Though, the ideal
would be for an assistant
to handle this process
on its own instead of the
end-user performing the
setup and triggering the
tasks.
With better datasets
and increased funding
on machine learning and
natural language process-
ing research, it’s expected
that the conversational
abilities and contextual
awareness of these
assistants would vastly
improve as we head into
the future. Furthermore,
with microwaves and
refrigerators now possess-
ing the capability to link
up with the internet, we’re
waking up to an increas-
ingly internet-connected
world each day.

impressive feature set.
