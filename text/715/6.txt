London is world famous for the variety of music it
offers its residents every night. The alternative
music performed by wierd bands in even wierder
venues is often overlooked, though. In this article
Christopher Murray writes about his experiences
of alternative music
Probably the most
memorable concert of all
those that I have attended
was Einsturzende
Neubaten's affair. Doubts
began on the discovery that
the venue, Heaven, is a
notorious gay night club,
although, perhaps I should
have guessed this from its
Freudian location; that is,
thrust imbetween one of
the Charing Cross arches.
To be fair, the only
evidence of the arse-bandit
fraternity were the butch
mastouched clone barman
and a neon display that
occassionally advertised
'Mr Gay UK' as one of the
forthcoming events.
The venue complimented
the music, which can only
be described as 'different'.
The percussion in
particular was not quite
what had been expected: in
fact, it looked as if it had
been constructed from
parts obtained from a
breaker's yard: It was
remarkable that when the
'instruments' and the
screams of Blixa Bargeld,
the vocalist who has the
appearance of a skeleton
with skin shrink wrapt
around it, co-ordinated an
impressive sound was
produced. Unfortunately,
these moments were very
sparse owing to
disagreements amongst the
band and power failures.
Bargeld is probably
better known for his
involvement with Nick Cave
and The Bad Seeds, to
whom my initial response
was utter repulsion since
there is not one feature of
their music that this
endearing on the first
listening. Cave's music can
be described as a fusion of
blues and punk, which in
spite of its outwardly
raucous nature is
surprisingly sensitive at
itmes; His previous band,
the Birthday Party, was
even more overt and is now
regretably defunt. The
concerts are unique: Cave
staggers on stage, stoned,
wearing a bow tie and
waist-coat; he stands, eyes
glazed, someone shouts
out, 'Do you what to buy
some smak?' and then he
begins in wails and
contorts himself. His arm's
is twisted behind his back,
body doubled-over when
singing a repressive song
and disfigures himself to
other positions according
to and as the mood of
music changes. This
probably reads like an 'I've
seen the light after being
preached to by Billy
Graham' monologue,
however, the heart and soul
of the music of many of
these bands is lost in the
production when
transfering it to vinyl,
certainly, the Cult, Spear of
Destiny and Killing Joke
are good examples of
bands who are affected by
this complaint.
the lyrics
I therefore have to ask
myself whether I am
growing old or are the
present day bands
incapable of producing
lyrics that compare with
those of the Clash, Theatre
of Hate, Paul Weller and
others?
The television
programme, the Tube, once
did an investigation about
why people went to Three
John's and Redskins's
concerts, both of which are
very left-wing bands, for
the politics or for the
music? Typical answers
were:
'Well I think the band tow
the party line too much.'
'I'm a bit to the left of them,
y'know, I'd like to see a bit
more violence'.
The Three Johns are
actually worth listening to
and infact most of their
songs are apolitical.
New Model Army are
another example. They are
reasonably talented even if
the level of subtly
degenerates to 'I believe in
getting the bastards'
attitudes.
The faction of alternative
music that best
demonstrates the departure
from it s origins is Goth,
which, although music is
reasonable, has moronic
and crass heavy metal
lyrics. Gothic music deals
with sinister dark age's
depression, supernatural
and superstition, so
consequently, songs tend
to be about trantulas
squeezing in and out of the
eye sockets of putrifying
skulls and entitled, as the
Three Johns suggested,
'Black cloud over Watford'.
The typical gothic person is
easily recognisable from
the black peacock hair cut,
the black skin tight attire
and the magpie lust of
shinny jewelry. The Sisters
of Mercy, now demised, is
a good example of this type
of band; Andy Eldrich, the
lead singer and an Oxford
graduate (well its the only
option after the civil service
reject you) walks in with
the rest of the band, all
clad in black flasher macs
and sunglasses, Other
Goth groups incude Xmal
Deutschland, Skeletal
Family and Death in June.
The latter is probably the
only original one, although
in the same sense as a
circus freak would be: they
are a Fascist band having
prouced some great
numbers such as 'C'est un
reve', which is about Klaus
Barbi, the butcher of
Toulouse.

FJack in 77, Punk could
be described as being
'socially aware'; nowdays
bands that have a punk
label amount to little more
than screaming and
shouting outfits and if their
lyrics can be understood,
the the vast majority of
their music deals with the
nocturnal activities of the
vocalist's member, or what
he would like to believe it is
doing. Those few that are
politically motivated tend to
revel in slogans or make it
impossible to distinguish
There are, however,
exceptions, Billy Bragg for
one who, apart from his
song-writing talents, is also
capable of interacting well
with his audience: The
quote 'I wrote this song for
Toyah Wilcox, but as yet
she hasn't had the fucking
good grace to cover it, so
I'm stuck with singing the
bastard thing myself,
springs to mind; In fact, his
powers of oration are such
that he has turned a hostile
audience of Clash fans
completely around.
Some of their past concerts
have ended in police raids
and stabbings,
consequently at the one I
attended, a through body
search was carried out on
entrance and by the time I
had arrived quite a
considerable pile of
offending objects had
accumulated; still worries
were allayed by the rather
impressive build up to DIJ's
arrival: it consisted of
various 1930's depressed
Germanic folk songs such
as 'Ich bin ein Einsteiner',
thus by the time the band
walked on stage, members
of the front row were
saluting and goose-
steeping. In retrospect,
they were an anti-climax,
having followed Annie
Anxiety, the support, who
defy any categorisation:
they produced
monotonous, god-awful
wailing to drum beat
noises; the only instrument
that is arguable tuneful is a
scraping violin and only
because it is accompanied
by a Trascendiant 2000, an
excellent machine that
