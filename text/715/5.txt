Mrs Thatcher, sex, IC
and the single student
Sex, and sexism, is there a
difference? A woman, and
a good pair of tits? Images
of bondage, bestiality,
sadism, nymphomania and
the fantasies of a rapist?
Showing these images, and
supporting the rapist's
motivations? Degradation,
and sexism? Freedom, and
license?
An attempt has been
made, over the past three
years, to debate these
questions. Though the
attempt for informed and
serious discussion failed, it
did succeed in stopping
RSMU Rugby Club from
showing hard-core
pornography. Also it
brought to the surface,
anger, hatred and
ignorance.
During the 'hard-core'
pornography debate
tempers flared, threats of
violence were used, sick
insults made. Intimidation
and character assasination
were a part of the tactics
employed by the RSM
supporters. The very issue
at stake, the destruction of
the humanity of women,
and wider still, people, was
used as a weapon in the
debate. Persuade people
women are only sexual
objects and you destroy
their humanity, their right
at, rape, nuke, or kill them
with no ethical qualms.
Ethics are extremely
important. At this college
students face ethical
decisions about South
Africa and aparthied,
animal experimentation,
nuclear weapons, women
and sexism. These
decisions are forced upon
them by the nature of their
studies and their college.
At Imperial, it seems, all the
relevant moral and political
issues of the day are not
just theoretical, not just
philosopher's hot air, but
are real. Yet if you listen to
the debates, the arguing,
the protests, what do you
hear? Silence, interrupted
momentarily by the
vomiting of arrogant, half-
digested meals of 'fast
food' ideas. The micro-
waved 'Freedom' burger
and 'its only a laugh' chips
being a staple part of the
diet.
It is proudly proclaimed
that our college is non-
political. It is seen to be a
major part of a sabbatical's
credibility that he/she
rejects politics. But you
cannot reject politics. All
that is rejected is the
politics of dissent, criticism,
and protest, something that
is not a monoploy of the
left. This leaves Imperial
with the politics of apathy,
acquiesence and
condoning silence. This, by
its nature, is not loudly
'Michael Newman is a jerk'
People are generally
nice, when we study beside
them, chat to them, or
drink with them. These
situations, involving no
stress or provocation, are
used to defend the
proposition that racism,
sexism and prejudice are
minimal at this college. We
are like werewolves, with all
the appearance of
humanity and geniality, but
in the full moon, or when
little sis' brings 'big, black
boy' home, we transform to
the raging monster. We
require a reason to exhibit
our prejudices, otherwise
we can'appear as nice as
Dr Jekyll.
to say no. Persuade people
Michael Newman is a jerk,
you destroy my humanity
and no one will respect, or
try to understand what I
say. Why listen to a jerk?
In politics and religion an
effective way to deal with
an opponent, is not to
silence them, but to
encourage people to laugh
at, ignore or hate them. All
of these require an
ignorant, simplistic view of
the opponent, preferably a
short, derogatory nick-
name with the required
undertones.
This is most effective
during war, to motivate the
soldiers to kill their enemy,
and their enemy's family.
The method of reducing a
human being to an illusion,
in the perceiver's mind, of
something less than
human, whether due to
their colour, religion,
nationality, behaviour,
appearace, sex, or beliefs,
is what we call degradation.
Something less than human
illicites less respect than a
person, they are seen to
have n6 HUMAN rights.
You can torture, gas, laugh
spoken, yet it is just as
political. It is seen at its
strongest in Orwell's '1984',
or Huxley's 'Brave New
World', or Nazi Germany.
This is the politics needed
by the dictators of the Left
and Right.
Margaret Thatcher
dislikes criticism and
complaints, it irritates her.
You would have observed
this in her condescending
remarks about the recent
Birmingham riot. She likes
Imperial, it is a college of
application, of industry, not
of philosophy or the arts.
Her favourite businessman,
Clive Sinclair (Sir), lectures
here. Here her cabinet
ministers receive no
protests, she received a
very small reception of less
than a hundred protesters,
mostly from other colleges.
No rotten eggs are thrown.
Protest, dissent, are
minimal or absent.
Imperial College trains
technicians and engineers,
not real scientists. Lord C P
Snow thought scientists
were the freest of people,
free in terms of their work
and free in terms of
thought. H G Wells thought
scientists were the saviours
of the world. He slammed
this college, his college, for
its failure to develop the
free-thinking minds science
requires. His criticisms of
the college, a hundred
years ago this year, ring
true today.
A fight that ultimately
occurs in the mind of the
single student, the
individual struggling
against conformity and the
power of ignorance.
O
We are the college fnat
trains the bomb designers,
the engineers willing to
work under aparthied, or
build gas chambers, the
designers of bacterial and
chemical warfare.
Technicians who see their
job as to do the work
required of them, without
any uncomfortable
questions.
Imperial College is the
politics and science of a
frightening future. A future
of cold-blooded free
market, of government
controlled science, of the
science of control, public
control. A society of the
silent, self-interested.
Where there is no need to
suppress dissent because
no one cares enough to do
something, to criticise.
Where the official censor is
replaced by dusty shelves
and waste-paper bins
collecting unwanted and
unread books. Where
people become names, and
names are rubbed out.
The issues at stake are
important ones, the debates
long lasting, and their
conduct is as much an
issue as those being
debated. The fight is for
freedom . The chains are
those that fetter fhe mind.
You cannot see or feel
them, their nature is that
you are unlikely to believe
they are there. This fight is
one of thought, critical
doubt, discussion, seeking
the truth through scientific,
method. It is the
application of our science.
