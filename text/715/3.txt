motion at the next day's
UGM that, if passed, would
result in the Union
organising a boycott of all
College bars until the
Union took control of the
Union Bar. He seems to
have spend about half an
hour thinking about the
motion. He thinks that
students will boycott
Southside as well as the
Union. Most students who
drink in Southside don't
care about the Union Bar.
They like a quiet, cheap
evening in hall. The
students who drink in
Southside are, in general,
not hacks. They don't care
about U G M decisions. On
Monday morning the Union
Bar will have little stock
because Carnival will run
the stocks low. It will have
no staff bacause Brian and
Doug have gone. A boycott
may well give Rob Northey
the excuse he needs to
close the Union Bar. In
other words we could end
with the Union Bar closed
and Southside still trading
successfully. The only
people hurt will be the
Union hacks who regularly
drink in the Union. By the
time you read this the U G M
may well have decided to
support the boycott. If it
has, I hope the boycott
works. I just wish it had
tried another compaigning
tactic like a sit-in rather
going for a boycott that
might result in the Union
Bar closing for weeks or
months.
