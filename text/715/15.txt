Professor Eric Ash was much in evidence at Freshers Fair
on Tuesday. The new Rector of IC is pictured above with
members of RCS motor club.
Another notable presence was that of the boat club's
controversial new boat which cost the Union £6000. The
boat club, in a subtle political manouvre have named the
boat 'Eric Ash'.
Rector's
Reception
New Rector Eric Ash
encouraged new students
to take full advantage of
London social life during
his first reception for
freshers on Monday. In his
speech he also encouraged
students to take a greater
interest in current affairs by
reading the quality papers
as often as possible.
A fresh idea was to use
projected cartoons to
introduce the other
members of the platform
party to the new students.
One of Prof Ash's cartoons
that introduced
registrar Pete Mee.
Mark Simms
A small ceremony was held
earlier this week in memory
of former IC student Mark
Simms, who was killed in a
motor accident in 1984.
The rector, Professor Eric
Ash, accepted a garden
bench on behalf of the
college from Mark's friends
and relations.
Mark Simms graduated
from the Electrical
Engineering Department in
1983, and was an active
member of STOIC during
his time at college. Several
of his friends from the TV
studio were present for the
ceremony, which was held
on the Queen's lawn on
Wednesday.
