to Academic Affairs
With the Freshers' Week
festivities drawing to a
close and lectures
beginning in earnest, now
seems a good time to let
you know a little about the
Union's Academic Affairs
activities.
Academic Representatives
Most importantly, next
week (or soon after) you
will have the opportunity to
elect your own Academic
Reps. There are usually
two for each year-group,
and their task is to be the
first line of representation
between students in the
lecture theatre and their
lecturers. This involves
meeting with each lecturer
to inform them of the
group's feelings about
his/her course. If the
course is utterly
incomprehensible, the
lecturing inaudible, or the
problem sheets illegible
then it's the Academic
Reps' job to gently point
out to the lecturer where
he/she is going wrong and
to suggest politely that they
might like to pull their
socks up.
The Acadmic Reps from
each year and the
Departmental
Representative together
form the core of the
student side of the Staff-
Student Committee. As a
group they should be able
to deal with slightly wider
issues, such as: should this
course be taught at all?; is
the right material being
included?; why don't we
have a course on...?; etc. It
is essential that there is
student input to the overall
design of courses as
changes are made from
year to year.
Important-Sounding Names
If problems can't be
resolved at departmental
level, either because the
dept is being unreasonable
or the issue has an
interdepartmental aspect,
then the matter can be
dealt with by the Academic
Affairs Officer of the
Constituent College Union
or of IC Union. Between
them the four AAOs share
the task of making sure
student opinion is taken
notice of at College
committees with such
important'Sounding names •
as Board of Studies,
Engineering Board,
U ndergrad u ate/Postg rad-
uate Studies, Vacation
Training, etc. Things we
are concerned with include
setting up new courses (or,
more usually nowdays, the
scrapping of courses), the
type of degree each course
leads to, what the College
is doing to improve the
standards of teaching, etc. |
Taboo Subject
Did somebody mention
teaching standards?
Unfortunatly this sort of
thing tends to get pushed
under the carpet at times of
financial stringency.
However, it may surprise
you to learn that whereas
your teachers at school
were trained in the skills of
imparting knowledge, your
lecturers were dumped in
front of their first lecture
theatre without any formal
training at all. They will be
an expert in their field, but
put in front of a hundred
expectant students they
may well end up fumbling
their way through even the
best prepared course,
causing students to
become bored, confused
and eventually
disillusioned. It is not
usually, I hasten to add, for
lack of caring about their
teaching. A few are natural
teachers, but most are not
and would be improved
with even the most basic
The Academic Affairs Officer on his way to Board of Studies
instruction in teaching
methods. The Union has
been in favour of this for
years, but without much
success.
How You Can Help
The most basic way you
can help your
representatives get results
is to make sure they know
your opinions. Speak to
them personally and make
sure they're doing their
jobs properly. At the end of
each lecture course you
will be asked to fill in a
questionaire about the
course and the lecturer.
The College produces lots
of academic statistics such
as A-Level points and drop-
out rates. We aim to
compile figures showing
the causes for these
effects, such as how many
students are dissatisfied
with their lecturers or lab

work. This depends on you
giving up a few minutes at
the end of each course.
If you've read this far you
obviously have some
interest in Academic
Affairs. You can take an
active role by becoming
one of the aforementioned
Academic Reprs. If the
thought of having to tell a
distinguished professor that
actually the first year aren't
all that impressed with his
course doesn't put you off
then you are the
man/woman for the job.
Effective representation
depends on ordinary
students like you putting
themselves forward for
election. You will certainly
find the experience
rewarding.
There are also positions
available for two ordinary
members and the secretary
of the IC Union Academic
Affairs Committee, for
which elections will be held
at the next U G M . If you're
interested in the College-
wide Academic Affairs
work, get yourself
nominated on the papers
posted in the central foyer
of the Union Building. If
you'd like to discuss what
the post involves drop me a
note in my pigeon-hole in
the Union Office.
