NOTHING/DOTING/
BLINDNESS
Henry Green
Three novels, each fairly
intellectual and dealing a
lot with the emotions. All
are brilliantly written, but,
due to the many cross-
currents within them make
difficult going. Nothing and
Doting are both quite
amusing, but Blindness,
about a writer blinded as a
boy, is more bleak and
morbid. (Picador, £2.95)
BY THE WATERS OF
LIVERPOOL
Helen Forrester
This is part of Helen's
autobiography describing
her childhood in Liverpool
during the 1930's and war
years, including the time
she was suspected of being
a 5th Columnist. It does not
make galvanising reading.
(Fontana, £1.95)
MURPHY
Samuel Beckett
Another intellectualist book
- and another involving
books
mental illness. This time
the central character is
Murphy from (where else)
Ireland, who works in a
mental hospital. Strangely
for Beckett, there are even
a few laughs, but it is not a
light book, and I found I
could only fully appreciate
it on the third reading.
(Picador £2.95)
WILT ON HIGH
Tom Sharpe
This is billed as vulgar,
lavatory humour, but it
really is a good funny
story, less sexist than I
imagined it to be. It takes
the Mickey out of several
self-satisfied organisations
- the medical and security
forces among them. Should
appeal to most Imperial
men. (Pan, £1.95)
THE ANGRY MOUNTAIN
Hammond Innes
More stirring Boys-Own-
Paper adventure stuff, for
lads who want men to be
men, women to be women
(but not lesbians), and
small furry creatures from
Alpha Centauri to be shot
on sight. The characters
are predictable - a Hero
tortured by memories, an
Evil Villain, plus a bit of
skirt... sorry, romantic
interest in the shape of a
lovely Contessa. Definite
pulp. (Fontana, £1.50)
THE LEOPARD HUNTS IN
DARKNESS
Wilbur Smith
Suprisingly, not a very bad
book, one of its main
defects being peoples'
characters portrayed as
good or bad - there are no
shades of grey. The plot
develops into Great White
Hope versus Evil Power
Crazed Chief, but
descriptions of the
Zimbabwian country are
worh reading reading even
if the rest of the book is
trash. (Pan £2.95)

LACE II
Shirley Conran
Don't bother.
\MorT
emits various painful
screaches when it knobs
are twisted. The lead
singer, a female punk
midget who has an
incredably large mouth and
strong vocal chords,
demonstrated that it is still
possible to sing with the
microphone clenced
between ther teeth.
Consequently, the lyrics
were incoherent but what I
think I heard was:
If you drive a car,
then someday you're going
to crash;
Crash into me
-up me
ram into me
-ram it up me
in a lay-by
-lay me.
However, I would accept
that the above had been
heavily influenced by my
imagination.
Bands that have amassed
a large cult followings and
limited chart success tend
to play at the Hammersmith
Palais, although it is
noticeable that double bills
of lesser know bands are
playing more frequently
here due to the regretful
closure of the Lyceum
Ballroom earlier this year,
whose site was most
compatible to these bands
requirements.
Occassionally the
Hammersmith Odeon is
used, although this is
rather unfortunate since it
is an all seated affair and
imposes obvious
restrictions. Examples of
other bands are the Cure,
New Order, Echo and the
Bunneymen, Spear of
Destiny, Killing Joke, the
Cult, Siouzie and the
Banshees and others. Both
the Palais and Odeon have
good accoustics and
consequently, the concerts
are of a high standard.
The smaller concert halls
include the Clarendon
Ballroom (Hammersmith)
Marquee (Soho) which is
soon due for expansion,
Electric Ballroom (Camden
and the Greyhound
(Fulham). To a small
extent, ULU is also used.
In this piece it has been
impossible to describe
every sub-category, let
alone every band—try
looking at Time Out listings
to appreciate the number;
infact, I have only
mentioned a few of the
better known ones. The
article is also very dated
since bands and styles are
constantly changing and
this is why the music is
exciting, currently the
Jesus And Mary Chain are
the 'in-thing'; to see them
in concert would do to your
street-cred what seeing the
Sex Pistols would have
dono eight years earlier. Do
not expect to see much
though, if you are lucky,
then they might play for
twenty minutes and then
the audience might destroy
the concert hall.
To answer the title, I hope|
this article has made you
more perplexed as to why
anybody enjoys listening to
this 'music' so that you are
stuck with that 'ever so nice
sounding pulp'—alternative
answer, or what?
