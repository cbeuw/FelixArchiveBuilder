IC Union will be boycotting all
College owned bars for a week
starting on Monday, as part of a
campaign to give the Union
control of the Union Bar. All
students have been requested
to keep out of the bars during
the week.
The motion calling for the
boycott was prompted by the
resignation of Doug Armstrong
and Brian Ellison (see front
page). It noted dissatisfaction
with Mr Northey's management
and called for IC Union to gain
control of the Union Bar.
Gareth Fish proposed the
motion saying that Mr Northey
was ripping students off by
overcharging. He also criticised
Mr Northey for sacking Mr
Armstrong and Mr Ellison.
Symon Corns attempted to
amend the motion so that
students would only be
requested to boycott the Union
Bar. He said that the students
who drink in Southside would
not support the boycott.
Mr Fish replied saying that a
boycott of the Union Bar only
would have no effect. The
amendment was defeated
heavily.
The motion was then passed
without opposition. Carl
Burgess, IC Union President,
informed the UGM that he
would be organising publicity
and pickets supporting the
boycott.
College Secretary, John
Smith, told FELIX that strong
arm methods don't necessarily
work. He said that he didn't
think a boycott was a very
sensible way to start talking
about a bar takeover. He said
that he thought the Union didn't
always appreciate the problems
associated with running the
bars.
Mr Smith is believed to
support Mr Northey's
management style. He thinks
that Mr Northey is managing to
sort out Victor Mooney's
mistakes.
Union President, Carl
Burgess, urged students to
support the boycott. He said it
was vital for the boycott to
succeed if the Union are to gain
control of the Union bar.
Burgess Ban
Rejected
The Rag Mag will be available
for sale as soon as the printer's
name and address has been
added, it was decided at the
Union General Meeting
yesterday.
Address labels are being
stuck in the 2000 Rag Mags
already in the Union's
possession and they are already
on sale. The remaining copies,
still at the printers, will now be
on sale as soon as the address
is added and they are stapled.
The Mag had been withdrawn
from circulation by the Exec
who decided that it contained
jokes unfit for publication, and
that it was probably illegal
because the printer had
removed his address from the
artwork.
Union President Carl Burgess
proprosed a motion calling for
future Rag Mags to be
inspected by a Censorship
Committee, and for the
offending pages of this year's
Mag to be reprinted in an
acceptable form. Rag Chairman
Jon Ingham put forward an
amendment allowing the Mag to
be put on sale in its present
form as soon as the printers's
address was added, whilst still
allowing for a Censorship
Committee to be formed for
next year's Rag Mag. A further
amendment, proposed by J
Martin Taylor, censured the
President for failing to properly
check the artwork before
printing, as he is required to do
under existing Council policy.
Both amendments were
convincingly carried.
Speaking to his motion Mr
Burgess said he believed the
contents of the Mag to be
detrimental to Imperial
College's image. We had to
consider the feelings of other
people, he said. When
questioned why he had
produced a similar Rag Mag
himself two years ago he said
he now realised that he had
been wrong to do this and he
regretted having done it.
Proposing the first
amendment, Mr Ingham
rejected the argument that the
College's image was damaged
by the Rag Mag. Visiting other
colleges he found that most
students thought IC Rag Mags
were 'great'. The extra cost of
reprinting parts of the Rag Mag
would mean less money for
charity.
City and Guilds Union
President, Roger Preece,
opposed the amendment. He
gave examples of some of the
jokes he objected to. Once the
College had a bad reputation
for producing sick humour it
would be hard to lose. However,
on the vote the amendment was
carried by a clear majority.

FELIX editorials have
criticised the Rag Mag.
This week's editorial
criticises the bar motion. It
is now Union policy that
we can sell the Rag Mag. It
is now Union policy that
we don't drink in the bars.
DON'T drink in the bars. It
is important that this policy
succeeds. The Union
should have control of the
bars. SELL Rag Mags.
Ensure that we make as
much as we can for
charity.
