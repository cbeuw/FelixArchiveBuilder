Students at Imperial
College will now be
working on UDAP projects

AP Tech Soc so far we
have received design and
third year project
suggestion in Mechanical
engineering, Electrical
engineering and Chemistry
disciplines.
On Wednesday
afternoons AP Tech Soc
carries out projects of a
broadly technical nature for
the local community. On
our first term of existence
we made some electronic
toys for handicapped
children in North
Kensington. If you are
interested in helping with
such projects please come
to the foyer in the
Mechanical Engineering
department next
Wednesday at 2pm.
For the weekend 11-13
October we have organised
a trip to the Centre for
Alternative Technology in
Wales. We will be looking
around the Exhibition of
Alternative Technologies
and Living the Sustainable
Lifestyle we will also get
involved in some practical
projects. If you want to
come, please send a
cheque for Â£14 (Inc travel,
food, bed) made out to
Imperial College Union, To
J Michaelis, Mech Eng 3,
(stating your department

possible, as space is
limited. We leave on Friday
11 at 5.30pm from Beit
Arch, returning late on
Sunday.
Appropriate for what?
Socialist Society
Welcome back to all you
socialists who were here
last year, and welcome to
all new ones.
Having flocked to see us
at Freshers' Fair, why not
come out with us
tomorrow? Michael Foot
will be unveiling a
memorial to the dead of the
International Brigade in the
Spanish Civil War, 48,000
volunteers from 53 different
countries went to Spain in
the first stand of democrats
and socialists against
fascism (and Spain was the
last country in Europe to
be free from Fascism.).
Five hundred of the
British battalion, named
after Clement Atlee, were
killed, and 1200 wounded,
out of 2000 volunteers.
Enough history; be at
Jubillee Gardens, on the
South Bank at 12 noon, or
at Beit Arch at 11.30.
With the expected visit to
IC later this term of Keith
Joseph, we hope to have a
speaker ourselves from the
National Union of
Teachers, and to mount a
peaceful but unfriendly
picket to greet Sir Keith.
Then, watch out for Tarn
Dalyell, MP, who will be in
College to speak to a Soc
Soc meeting on Thurday 14
November.
After many years in
Parliament as a specialist in
science and Technology ,
Mr Dalyell should have a
great deal to say to anyone
at IC.
H G Wells Society
The HG Wells Society is
celebrating the centenary,
this year, of Well's student
days at the college. These
celebrations include a
fantastic series of our
regular Monday night
meetings including such
guests as Dr Edward de
Bono, Patrick Reid MBE,
Nigel Calder, Douglas
Adams.
The first meeting is this
Monday, 7 October, at
7.30pm in Mech Eng 220,
when Michael Bentine,
brilliant comedian and
presenter, will be talking
about his life-long interest
in the psychic powers of
the mind, or The Doors of
the Mind. Prof Eric
Laithwaite, our President
will chair the meeting, and
at the end Michael Bentine
will make the draw for a
raffle in aid of Save the
Children.
With the famines of
Ethiopia and Sudan the
plight of children has
grown even worse. Usually
the children, being the
weakest and with the
greatest needs, suffer first
in the poverty of the third
World. The statistics of
malnutrition and starvation
are horrifying. They need
our help, no matter how
small is our contribution.
This year our society has
organised a raffle , you will
see the leaflets advertising
it soon. All the profits,
every single penny, will go
to Save the Children. The
tickets cost 20p each. I
urge you to either donate
some money, or to buy
some tickets. Your support
is needed.
Why not come and hear
the children's favourite
comedian, Michael Bentine,
join the best society in
College, and help the
suffering children around
the world.
Balloon Club
He awoke to the soft blue
light filtering through the
curtains and turned over.
The girl, disturbed by his
movement, opened her
eyes and murmured: 'I love
you.' Her arms tightened
around him. For one
blissful moment he began
to sink into the warmth
with not entirely virtuous
thoughts.
And then the realisation
hit him: Blue light. 'My
God, it's flyable!' he cried,
and was out of bed, and
away.
The sacrifices made to
go ballooning aren't alway
as great as this, of course.
But when the summer has
been as bad as it has this
year, us balloonists get
desperate.
This was the summer
when almost every chance
to fly was ruined by rain.
We still saw plenty of the
country (the Lake District
and the Peak District, I'm
told, look their best in the
rain. ) We tried a cross
London flight on several
occasions. These can only
be attempted on the few
times a year when air traffic
controllers co-operate by
rescheduling aeroplane
flights. Yet again it rained.
But sometimes
everything goes right and
the sacrifices seem
worthwhile. At the Bristol
Balloon Fiesta the rain
stopped, the clouds parted,
and 97 ballooons took off
from a single field to float
gently over Bristol and then
out over Bath.
This term we are hoping
to go to the meets at
Kettlewell on the Yorkshire
moors, and to Humber, and
there will be plenty of short
trips (a day or an evening)
to Newbury. There'll
certainly be plenty of
disturbed nights sleep...
IC Socialist Society: they will be at the Jubilee Gardens on
the South Bank at 12 noon tomorrow to watch Michael
Foot unveil a memorial
