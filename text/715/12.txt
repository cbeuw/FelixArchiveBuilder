Caving
The club is a small, friendly
group who enjoy leaving
London about once a
fortnight to visit the best
caving areas of England
and Wales, where caves
and pot holes of immense
variety and varying
difficulties are explored.
Much of our caving takes
place in the Yorkshire
Dales, in some of the most
enjoyable and exciting
caves in Britain. The club
has an extensive store of
equipment and its members
are well versed in modern
caving techniques and so
no experience or gear is
necessary. This year we are
running two introductory
weekends on 11-13 and 18-
21 of October, to the
Mendips and South Wales
respectively.
During the vacations we
have extended trips to the
Dales or even Ireland. In
summer we have visited
France for three years,
where some of the best
caving in Europe, the sun,
wine and good food
combine to give memorable
tours. This summer we
descended the Gouffre
Berger in the Alps, the
world's fifth deepest cave.
Over the last six years we
have been on expedition to
Morocco, Greece; and in
1984 Peru where we
discovered the longest cave
so far in the country.
Throughout the year the
club has a lively social life
which provides an ideal
complement to the
mundane world of problem
sheets and lectures. Come
along to our weekly
meetings on Wednesdays
at 1pm in the Union Lower
Lounge/Snack Bar.
IC SFSOC
Greetings fellow sentient
beings. In case last issue's
story has left you baffled,
full edification and
explaination can be
obtained from WHJC, our
very own fanzine (that's a
magazine produced by
fans). This impeccable
publication may be
obtained at any SFSOC
event and is free to all IC

will be showing

Come along and find out).
Now the perpetual time
paradox of the editorial

met all sorts of SF authors

sportscene this year. A full results table will be
printed each week and for this we require the
cooperation of all club officials and team
captains. Completed results slips, together with
any copy you wish to submit, should be
returned to the FELIX office on Wednesday
evening for mid-week games and on Monday
morning for weekend fixtures. We also have a
reporter and a photographer interested
specifically in covering sports events, so inform
FELIX well in advance if your club is taking
part in any prestigious competitions such as
those organised by the UAU.

use our library. This year's
first film is on Tuesday. See
you there!
