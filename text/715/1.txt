Northey Hammered
in Resignation Row
Union barmen Doug Armstrong
and Brian Ellison resigned on
Wednesday in protest over
refectory manager Rob
Northey's attitude to their
running of the Union bar.
They both handed in one
month's notice following
comments made to Mr
Armstrong by Mr Northey on
Tuesday afternoon. Later, just
before the Union bar opened on
Wednesday evening, they were
turned out by Mr Northey who
then took charge of the bar
himself.
There has been friction
between Mr Northey and the
Union bar staff for some time.
In an interview with FELIX Mr
Armstrong said that the new
refectory manager had shown
no interest in the Union bar or
the students. His shock
resignation came less than a
week after Mr Northey
introduced his controversial
price rises, as reported in FELIX
on Monday.
Trouble flared when Mr
Northey confronted Mr
Armstrong over the Union Bar
takings for the New Year Party
on Monday. Mr Northey
expressed dissatisfaction with
the way the bar had been run
and said that Mr Armstrong
should have had a third bar for
the party. Mr Armstrong told
FELIX that such a bar had
rarely proved profitable in the
past. The bar takings for
Monday were Â£3374, a sum only
been surpssed by a Guilds
Carnival when there was an
entension till 3 am. Mr
Armstrong felt that Mr Northey's
comments were an insult to his
ability to run the Union bar, and
seeing this as a vote of no
confidence from his employer,
he was compelled to resign.
A hastled Rob Northey on
Wednesday night
Brian Ellison and Doug Armstrong
Mr Northey received letters of
resignation from Mr Armstrong
and Mr Ellison on Wednesday
morning. He was contacted by
FELIX at 4.00pm but declined to
comment on the resignations.
He said that he had learned the
news from College Secretary
John Smith shortly before
receiving the letters, but did not
know enough about the
situation to comment further.
Upon hearing that the barmen
had resigned, Union President
Carl Burgess took the matter
directly to John Smith. Mr
Smith, it appears, fully
supported Mr Northey and felt it
natural that some staff should
be dissatisfied with a change of
management. Mr Burgess feels
that the Union barmen did the
best job possible on Monday.
This view was underlined by
Deputy President Dave
Kingston who said that Mr
Armstrong and Mr Ellison had
worked from 10.00am till 3.00am
on the day of the party.
Mr Burgess said that IC
Union should try to take over
the running of the Union bar
and was hoping to persuade
students to support a boycott of
the bars at Thursday's UGM.
At 5.45pm on Wednesday
afternoon Mr Northey, together
with assistant refectory
manager Martin Parsons,
entered the Union bar and
informed Mr Armstrong and Mr
Ellison that their services were
no longer required. Bar staff
in the Union bar
regulars Chris Hendy, Pete
Hartley and Sean Davis
immediately left the bar. They
told FELIX that they would not
be prepared to work in the
Union bar following Mr
Northey's dismissal of the two
barmen.
Mr Armstrong said that Mr
Northey did not feel he could
be trusted to look after the bars
takings on one month's notice.
He expressed his apologies to
RSM and RCS for any
disruption that might be caused
to their barnights, and regretted
that the incident had occured
during Freshers' week. He said
that Mr Northey spent all his
time looking after Southside bar
and did not care about the
Union bar or about students. He
stressed that running the Union
bar was not like running any
other bar. The Union, he said,
has its own traditions and
needed to have consistency,
and added that he would like to
drink in the Union bar in future.
Mr Northey again declined to
make any statement yesterday
evening. He said he would be
available for comment after
meeting with John Smith on
Thursday morning.
There were some ugly scenes
in a packed union bar last night
when students learned of the
dismissal of Mr Armstrong and
Mr Ellison, a beer glass was
thrown at the bar and several
groups of students shouted
chants at Mr Northey.
