Southside Security
Dear Freshers,
I would like to bring to
your attention the following
facts regarding Security at
Imperial.
1. Over the summer, over
Â£9000 of personal
possessions was stolen
from people staying in
Linstead Hall. It is generally
accepted that this was
accomplished by the use of
a master key on rooms in
the Linstead Extension.
College have not changed
the locks on the burgled
rooms and so the thief can
carry out an identical
operation at anytime in the
future. Depending on the
type of master key used
(which is unknown) any
student in any Hall of
Residence may be
vulnerable to burglary.
2. Access to Southside
Halls may be gained
usually by the Falmouth-
Tizard door entrances
which do not shut properly
due to insufficient force in
the closing springs. In any
case, undesirables may be
unwittingly admitted by
residents who open doors
and do not challenge
strangers waiting outside.
The outer door at the
Keogh-Selkirk end
frequently does not close
securely which allows easy
access once more.
3. In the same area, ie
between the outer and
inner doors of the Keogh-
Selkirk end of Southside
there is a rape alarm. You
may not have noticed this
because it is not labelled. It
is a small, brushed
aluminium box opposite the
key card lock and remains
unlabelled because
Security do not have a key
to turn it off in case of
accidental (or indeed
intentional) activation. You
operate it by inserting your
fingers upwards from the
base into the box.
4. It is well known that a
certain Security Guard in
Linstead arrives for his
shift, sets an alarm clock
for his next round (about 2
hours later) and then goes
to sleep on a camp bed.
Effectively, there is no
Night Security on the
nights when this Guard is
on duty. It is coincidental
that this Guard was on duty
on the night of the Linstead
burglery this summer.
5. The 'red flashing light'
security system at the
Falmouth-Tizard end of
'Useless' Films
Dear Sir,
We were interested to read
the letter in FELIX No 713
from Dave Clements, in
which our films, shown last
year, were described as
'useless'.
We wondered whether
other students would agree
that 'Ghandi', 'Merry
Christmas Mr Lawrence',
'War games', 'Paths of
Glory', 'Dr Strangelove',
'Sophies Choice' etc were
'useless'. However, we all
quite liked them.
Yours faithfully

Southside may be turned off
by means of a very obvious
switch next to the red
flashing light. Security did
not come to inspect this for
at least an hour.
I would advise all
students to take the utmost
care in protecting their
belongings because it is
evident from the above
(situation as of September
18) that College Block is
not worried about breaches
of Security and hence does
not care about the students
at Imperial.
Yours faithfully

Selkirk Alterations
Dear Editor,
As representitives of Selkirk
Hall, we would like to
protest at the blatant
inconsideration and
complete lack of sympathy
with which Imperial College
has approached the
alterations currently taking
place in the halls of
residence on Southside.
Without consultation with
any student representitives,
the College has decided to
carry out major alterations
within the halls, which will
have profound
consequences for the
social life and thus the
quality of life in the halls.
Laundry and central
cooking facilities are being
closed, and rooms on each
staircase are being
converted into small
kitchens, with a
corresponding loss of
revenue to the college.
Although there is no doubt
that some changes were
necessary, these plans are
about to be implemented
with neither consultation
with, nor the support of,
the students who must Jive
and work under
considerable
inconvenience.
Work has started already
on some of the
conversions, and appears
to be timed to coincide
with freshers week, when
hundreds of new students
will be gaining their first
impressions of Imperial
College. Clearly, this will
not show the College to its
best advantage, nor will it
make life easier for the re-
aps, whose preparations
are already being disrupted
to a considerable extent.
Why was work not at
least started over the
summer holidays? Does
Imperial now consider the
temporary summer
residents are that much
more important than its
students?
Yours Sincerely,
The re-aps of Selkirk Hall

Bars
Rob Northey came to
Imperial just over six
months ago. He was hailed
as the answer to the
College's bar and refectory
problems. He was seen as
the young innovative
manager needed to sort the
decaying mess Victor
Mooney had managed to
leave. In the last six months
he has supported
Southside Bar Manager
Roger Pownell's attempts
to make Southside into the
sort of bar where most
students would like to
drink. He has decided to
open a refectory in
t o f i a
Southside that will sell wine
bar food in the evening. He
has attempted to rid the
refectories of some of their
most incompetant staff. All
these changes are the sort
of improvements that
students were hoping for
when he took over.
Unfortunately, though, he
has no understanding of
the way the Union Bar
Works. The Union Bar has
two functions: it is
designed to service the big
parties like Carnival. It is
also designed for the bar to
be used by the Rugby
clubs CCUs etc when they
want to get drunk. It is built
to withstand people trying
to smash it up. The staff
employed know how to
handle a hundred drunk
rugby players. It isn't
designed to appeal to
people out for a quiet
drink.
Mr Northey has refused
to except the system that
exists in the Union Bar. He
has not supported Doug
Armstrong and Brian
Ellision who know just how
to run the Union. He has
allienated the excellant set
of casuals that Doug and
Brian recruited by asking
for their National Insurance
numbers. The Union has
had little or no investment.
It is almost as though he
has set out to get rid of
Brian and Doug by making
their situation impossible.
Today Carnival is taking
place in the Union. It's just
the sort of event where the
experience of Brian and
Doug is essential.
Unfortunately the event is
likely to be chaos. There is
unlikely to be enough
experienced staff to run the
bar. Carnival may well be
ruined because without a
late bar it will be a waste of
time.
There is very little Rob
Northey can do about
bringing Brian and Doug
back. He could try
apoligising to them both.
Tempers are such, though,
that there is very little
chance of them coming
back.

Wednesday evening Carl
Burgess walked into the
FELIX office. He informed
us that he was proposing a
