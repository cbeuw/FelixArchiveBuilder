'This ain't no party...'
Regular club-goers are unlikely to be
overly impressed with the Hip Parade at
the Camden Palace, (Tuesday nights).
Little has changed during the long
vacation; Big Bertha and her mate are still
'hanging' around, every inch of her twenty
foot fluffiness a woman. Newcomers to
the regular clientele are Princess Diana,
and spouse plus a handful of other cast-
offs from Spitting Image's huge collection
of characatures. Other than that? Well, the
laser's still green; and the drinks are
exorbitant.
'...this ain't no disco...'
On the dance-floor, Angus resident DJ
plays the usual selection of categorised
dance-dross, designed to make your feet
ache. Early evening plays 'dismal-dance',
(Jesus and Mary Chain, Echo, Cult, etc),
moving to Electro (400 Blows) and Hi-
Energy at about 10. There is chart mega-
mixing, including the irrespressible
Frankie Goes To Pieces, from 11 and soul
music closes the set from 12 till 2. Take
your pick, but come early and avoid the
rush, (you can't move by midnight).
'...this ain't nothing at all.'
And of course it's entirely free. As ever,
FELIX has ten pairs of tickets up for
grabs. Strictly first come first served, from
the FELIX Office. Have Fun.

LUC BESSON
The extroadinary story of
the underground lives of
the Paris tunnelers, (young
rich-kids who spend wild
weekends deep in the Paris
Metro, is documented in
Luc-Besson's New film,
Subway, Lumiere Cinema,
Chelsea Cinema, Camden
Plaza).
Subway deftly circle-lines
its way around every aspect
of the typical French
romantic thriller without
ever quite reaching its
destination. Fred,
(Christiopher Lambert),
bursts his way into the
criminal world of the Paris
Metro after gatecrashing
the birthday party of the
girl he loves. Constantly
watching the detectives, he
casually spends his time
making music, money,
friends and trouble,
unaware that his life is in
danger.
I have to say, I've seen
more stylish treatments,
and Subway fails not so
much because of lack of
style as its total lack of
tangible storyline. As a
thriller it thrills not. and the
polite humour does, little *o
redeem the situation.
Athough little can rival its
earlier contemporary,
(Jean-Luc Beinex's Diva),
as a stage for our
glamourous rich-kids,
Subway takes one hell of a
beating.
Fletch
Fletch can only be
described as rubbish. It is
mean't to be a vehicle for
the wit and humour of
Cherry chase (who, you
may well ask).
Unfortunately Mr Chase
seems totally boring with
little or no talent. He is
mean't to be an undercover
reporter who happens to
break up an major drugs
ring. It seems hard to
believe, though, that
someone as stupid as Mr
Chase could even work out
what a drugs ring is. At
present there are some bad
films on in London. FELIX
warned you against going
to several earlier this week.
Few, though, can be as bad
as Fletch. Avoid it.
