Despite the disadvantages of the present
Tory Government, it is still possible to
claim quite a lot of money from either the
taxman or the DHSS. Here, in the first
of a series of welfare articles, IC Welfare
Officer Lesley Gillingham explains what
you're entitled to and how to claim it...
Types Of Benefit And How To
Claim
1. Certificated Housing Benefit
and Housing Supplement
These benefits are only
available to those able to 'sign
on' as unemployed and
available for work in the area in
which they are paying rent.
These benefits are not
applicable for full-time students
in term time but they are
certainly the quickest way of
getting the highest amount of
your housing costs back over
the vacations. To claim, 'sign
on' at your local Unemploy-
ment Benefit Office (UBO) on
the first weekday of the
vacation. If you are not eligible
for unemployment benefit your
forms are automatically passed
on to the local Supplementary
Benefit Office (DHSS). The
DHSS will assess your claim
and will inform you in writing
of their decision.
Entitlement to supplement-
ary benefit carries with it
entitlement to Certificated
Housing Benefit.
The DHSS will send a
'certificate' on your behalf to
the local housing authority
authorising them to pay your
housing costs. In theory claims
should be resolved within
fourteen days (in practice they
rarely are) and can provide up
HOUSING BENEFIT
-and how to claim it—
to a 100% rebate of your rent
and rates.
If you are not eligible for
supplementary benefit the
DHSS will send you a form for
Standard Housing Benefit.
2. Standard Housing Benefit
Designed to help those on a low
income (including students)
with their housing costs. Under
the current regulations students
living in IC owned acc-
ommodation, ie Halls or
Houses (but not Head
Tenancies), are not eligible for a
rate rebate. Claim by sending a
claim form to the appropriate
Housing Authority. Student
Services keep a selection of
forms and can help you work
out which authority you should
send your claim to. When you
submit the claim form you
should also enclose:
a) proof of rent paid
b) proof of income ie grant
assessment form,
c) a recent bank statememt and
proof of any savings,
d) a copy of the term dates.
Claims cannot be back-
dated, they start from the day
the local authority Housing
Benefit Office receives the claim
form. So don't delay it could
cost you money. If you do not
have all the documents at hand
send in the form and state that
additional information is on its
way.
All London Benefit Offices
expect students to inform them
at the begining of the vacation
that they require their benefit
rate to be reassessed due to a
change in circumstances ie
income is less. This only applies
if you are not 'signing on' for
this period.
How to Calculate your
Standard Housing Benefit
1. Work out your 'Needs
Allowance':
Single Person £45.10
Couple £66.50
Each dependent
child £13.85
2. Work out your gross weekly
The undergraduate student
grant works out as £64.83pw
during termtime, of which
£20.80pw is disregarded for rent
(but not for rates) purposes,
leaving £44.03.
The vacation element in the
grant is £27.50 (not the summer
vacation) and no disregard is
made on this figure.
3. Work out your weekly rent
and rates:
If your rent includes any
amounts for gas or electricity
payments, money will be
deducted from your rent for
these. Maximum deductions
are:
heating—£6.25,
cooking—£0.75,
hot water—£0.75,
lighting—£0.50.
Your rent will then be divided
into rent and rates. Rates are
usually taken to be 30/35% of
your total rent. During
termtime students on a grant
must deduct £20.20 per week
from their remaining weekly
rent to get their 'eligible' weekly
rent figure. No deduction is
made in the vacation.
4. Calculate your rebate/
allowance:
a) If your income equals the
Needs Allowance figure:
Rebate/allowance = 60%
eligible weekly rent and 60%
weekly rates.
b) If your income is less than the
Needs Allowance figure:
Rates = 60% weekly rates plus
8% of the difference between
income and the Needs
Allowance figure.
Rents = 60% eligible weekly
rent plus 25% of the difference
between income and the Needs
Allowance figures:
c) If your income is more than
the Needs Allowance figures:
Rates = 60% weekly rates minus
9% of the difference between
income and the Needs
Allowance figure.
Rent = 60% eligible weekly rent
minus 26% of the difference
between income and the Needs
Allowance figure.
NB The £20.80 pw disregard of
income mentioned in 2 above
applies only to the calculation
of rent rebate/allowance. For
rate rebates your income is
taken as the full £64.83 pw.

If your parents contribute to
your grant, you can use a
covenant as a way of increasing
the money that they give you by
43%.
Convenants were developed
as a means of aiding tax-exempt
charities but there is no reason
why they shouldn't be used by
tax-exempt people of which
impoverished students are a
classic example.
How covenants work: Your
parents commit themselves in
writing to an undertaking to
pay a certain sum of money
each year for a period capable
of exceeding six years. This does
not commit your parents to
actually paying you for six
years, it is merely a legal
requirement of covenants that
they must be capable of
exceeding six years. After each
payment you get a form from
the tax office, fill it in, return it
to your tax office who will then
refund you the basic rate of tax
that your parents have already
paid on the money that you
receive under the covenant.
How to Draw up a Deed of
Covenant
The Consumer Assocation has
devised a form of deed which
the tax man should accept and
they have given permission for
its reproduction here.
Covenants a free gift
from the taxman
How to make a
deed of covenant
I, Ed Smith, of 16 Moon Street, Blackburn, covenant to
my son/dautghter, Jo Smith, of the same address, a gross
amount of £116.67 on each of the seven years, or for the
period of our joint lives, or until he/she ceases to be
receiving full-time education at any university, college,
school or other educational establishment (whichever is
the shortest period), the first payment to be made on 1st
October 1985.
Date 1 September 1985 Signed, sealed and delivered by
Edward Smith:
in the presence of
It is advisable to follow this
example exactly, substituting
the appropriate names,
addresses, amounts and dates
of payments.
Points T o Watch O u t For:
1. You can't benefit from a
covenant from your parents if
you are under eighteen or
married.
2. Your parents must be
taxpayers and you a non-
taxpayer.
3. The installments can be paid
at whatever intervals you like
but the first one must be after
the date on which the covenant
is signed. If you intend to claim
any benefits during the
vacations it may be worth using
the suggested payment dates
used in the example covenant
since these are designed to
correspond roughly with the
starting dates of each term and
should prevent the DHSS
trying to count covenanted
income as vacation income.
4 Amount—this can be stated
either as 'a gross amount of £x'
as in the example which means
that your parents deduct the
tax, which you will get back,
from the total contribution and
pay you the rest. This means
that they have to alter the
amount that they actually give
you every time the basic rate of
tax changes. So if the parental
contribution is £100 and tax is
30%, they would hand over £70
and you would get the other £30
from the tax man. If the basic
rate then went down to 25%,
they would have to pay you £75.
The other way of doing it is to
agree to pay 'an amount, which
after deduction of tax at the
basic rate, amounts to £x'. This
means that they pay the same
amount all the time, but the
refund from the tax man will
vary with changes in the basic
rate. This second variety is the
most common.
5. The formalities—you can
copy out the covenant with
alterations and it doesn't really
matter how you do this. The
important thing is that it must
be signed by whoever is paying
and witnessed by someone
other than yourself. It might be
advisable if the witness is not
your other parent but that
probably does not really
matter. However, since you
don't know whether the tax
man will query it until the end
of the tax year when, in a sense,
it is too late, it is better to play
safe. The other important thing
to remember is that T H E
D E E D MUST BE S E A L E D .
You can do this with sealing
wax or a disc of red paper which
you stick onto the deed. Your
parents should then hand the
deed over to you.
6. Covenants can be drawn up
at any time of the year and at
any point in the student's
course, but for maximum
benefit, the sooner the better.
7. The covenant can be
cancelled by mutual consent at
any time. Consequently if the
amount of parental contrib-
ution alters drastically due to a
change of circumstances, the
original covenant can be
cancelled and a new one made
out with the revised figures.
However, there is a theory that
too many cancellations may
lead the tax man to question
whether the covenants were
ever intended to last the full
period.
Other Earnings
The amount covenanted—ie
what you get from your parents
plus what your get from the tax
man—counts as your earned
income. This means that if the
money you receive under the
covenant, plus any other
income you have during the
year such as vacation earnings,
plus any supplementary/un-
employment benefit (but not
housing benefit), exceeds your
personal tax allowance (£2200
for a single person), then you
will have to start paying tax on
the excess.
Claiming the Money back
When your parents hand over
the covenant to you, send a
copy to your tax office. If you
haven't got a tax office look in
the telephone book under
Inland Revenue and contact the
nearest to where you live. They
will send you a tax form to
complete and instructions
about re-claiming your money.
For each claim, your parents
will need to complete form
R185(AP), available from the |
tax office, which is returned to
your tax office who will then
make the refund.

Services Office.
