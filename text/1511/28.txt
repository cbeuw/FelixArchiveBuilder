Keeping it Real
by Justina Robson
The pick of this year’s Picocon
A look at some of the books by the Guests of Honour at Imperial’s Sci-Fi convention
With a title like Keeping it Real and
a cover illustration of a semi-cyborg
super woman you might be forgiven
for assuming the first book of Justina
Robson’s Quantum Gravity series is
the kind of escapist trash that has us
all hating on Stephanie Meyer. The
fact that the series is entitled Quan-
tum Gravity gives some hint that
there may be more to things than in-
stantly meet the eye, and this is defi-
nitely the case.
Though Lila Black is a massively
enhanced superhuman spy, there are a
number of departures from the sort of
self-sufficient, badass feminist char-
acter whom you would expect here.
Lila comes with flaws aplenty, which
initially crop up as just this. Later the
details of the accident that left her at
death’s door become more and more
clear and what looks like an irrational
hatred and fear of certain aspects of
what proves to be a very interesting
world are actually completely jus-
tified… just in time for them to be
completely transformed.
I mention that the world is interest-
ing, but what I should probably say
is the ‘worlds’ plural are interesting.
Keeping it Real is set in a hemorrhag-
ing mash up of the realms of men,
elves, demons, fey and elementals,
all bleeding into one another to some
degree. In contrast to Robson’s ear-
lier works this is not, at least in the
first book, particularly science heavy,
and if you’re the kind of person that
needs a logical explanation as to why
a supercollider would explode and
create passages into magical realms
then perhaps this series isn’t for you.
Overall the science is reasonably
believable if not always explica-
ble and this leaves time free in the
short novel to flesh out what I (and
I assume Ms Robson) think to be the
more important issues of Lila herself,
as well as the colorful and disparate
worlds that she walks the character
through throughout the series. Per-
haps more importantly for a science-
fantasy fusion the magical system is
consistent, interesting and logical. It
contains interesting elements such as
the “games” that are essentially magi-
cally enforced wagers that can have
extreme consequences and are often
entered into unknowingly by humans
unable to play them out as confidently
as the elves and other magically en-
dowed beings from the other realms.
Book One focuses primarily on the
elves and the Elvish realm and culture
that Lila is unwillingly dragged into
despite a hatred and revulsion for this
secretive and different race – and the
magic that comes with them. In her
undercover mission to protect per-
haps the oddest elf in all the realms
– Zal, lead singer of a rock band ris-
ing rapidly to superstardom despite
the fact that “elves don’t rock” – Lila
has to try to ascertain the validity of
death threats that lead into a much
bigger and more complex plot than
she or her superiors ever imagined.
Add to this the identity issues inher-
ent in a 21 year old who’s been rebuilt
with largely prosthetic, or in fact ro-
botic, body parts, unable to return to
her home or her family and friends. A
21-year-old who has, of course, made
the mistake of getting into a roman-
tic game with Zal along the way (this
is perhaps a little predictable… but
who really cares so long as it’s hot,
right?).
Keeping it Real has all the elements
needed for an enthralling read and
delivered in a humorous and effort-
less manner I’d really recommend it.
“a hemorrhag-
ing mash up of the
realms of men, elves,
demons, fey and el-
ementals all bleeding
into one another”
The series, now onto its fifth book,
has been extremely successful and I
look forwards to finding some time to
consume those that I haven’t gotten
round to.

and Gold

Double Vision

forced by her company to testify at
a court case that will determine the
legal rights of artificial intelligences
and various extremist groups would
like nothing better than to see her
dead. Welcome to the world of Silver
Screen – Justina Robson’s cyberpunk
masterpiece.
At its core this book is a fascinating
journey of discovery as both Anjuli
and 901, the AI she works with, strug-
gle to find their place in the world.
This naturally leads on to the compel-
ling theme of what is consciousness
as the book asks: how do we define a
human being?
It’s also refreshing that, instead of
the default cyberpunk setting of a
sprawling megacity, much of the ac-
tion in Silver Screen takes place in an
England that is not to unrecognisable
from the country today. It took a bit
of getting used to high stakes intrigue
playing out in places like Manchester,
an unusual setting for this kind of lit-
erature, but it certainly added a sense
of intimacy to the story, and a feeling
that the situations it described could
really happen.

Empire in Black and Gold is the first
book in Adrian Tchaikovsky’s long
running Shadows of the Apt series.
The series is set in an intriguing uni-
verse populated by a number of differ-
ent humanoid races – each named af-
ter, and sharing certain characteristic
(such as wings) with, a specific insect
or arachnid species. This is a world
were magic and relatively advanced
technology, such as ornithopters and
steam power, coexist – an interest-
ing idea that gives a very attractive,
almost steampunk-like, feel to the
novels.
This first book in the series deals
with the beginning of the war of
conquest waged by the Wasp Empire
against the Beetle city-states of the
Lowlands. The opening chapter grabs
you instantly with its vividly de-
scribed battle scene. The book rarely
lets up the pace afterwards as it fol-
lows the desperate attempts, spurred
on by his being present at the brutal
capture of the city of Myna seventeen
years previously, of Stenwold Maker
to prepare his people for the deadly
onslaught of the Wasp armies. In
short, a perfect book for anyone who
likes well written action and intrigue.

Double Vision follows Karen ‘Cookie’
Orbach, a self proclaimed psychic,
who, whenever she looks at a tele-
vision screen, sees visions of a war
fought by humans and their machines
against a truly alien extraterrestrial
species on a distant planet. Employed
by the Dataplex Corporation to record
whatever she sees, Cookie also has to
deal with her ordinary life as an in-
secure, overweight person. However,
not all is as it seems with her visions,
and soon she begins suspect that her
employers aren’t telling her the whole
truth as to why they require her ser-
vices.
The best word that could be used to
describe this book is “weird”, but in
a good way. Little clues, and the use
of the second person narration in the
vision chapters, help to unnerve the
readers and gradually point them to
the surprising, but very satisfying,
conclusion. Another big plus for this
novel are its likeable, well developed
characters; especially Cookie her-
self – a massive science fiction fan
with whom the target audience will
have no trouble empathising with. If
you like the general feel of Philip K.
Dick’s work but want something that
is ultimately a bit more comprehen-
sible, this is the book for you.
