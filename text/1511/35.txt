Vintage bar night for hockey club
The Imperial College Hockey Club
(ICHC) hosted a bar night at Vintage,
formerly Chateau 6, on Thursday last
week. The event was open to all stu-
dents and served as a way for both
students involved in sports and others
to blow off some steam before the all-
important Varsity games this March.
The event was organised by ICHC
Club Captain Jason Ye and Social Sec-
retaries Guy Khosla and Gilles Stassen,
with tickets costing £5 and including a
free shot when bought online. Tickets
were also available on the door and
the venue filled up rapidly as the eve-
ning progressed. The organisers had
secured drinks deals with Vintage that
kept their attendees’ drinks flowing,
with beer and Jagerbombs at £2, vodka
mixers at £3 and a surprise addition
of Sex On The Beach cocktails at £3
following the generosity of the venue’s
staff hours before the event kicked off.
Two ICHC members, Joe Andrews
and Josh Freemont, (Jolt DJs) provided
the music and served as the DJs for the
dancefloor. Their exhilarating mashups
filled Vintage with avid students who
braved the snow to come out and ex-
perience an invigorating clubbing at-
mosphere. Coupled with the fair drinks
prices, the barrage of over 150 students
had an overall air of positivity about
the event.
We asked Jason Ye why he chose
Vintage for the venue rather than Met-
ric or the Union, and he explained that
“by holding it at Vintage, [they] were
not exposed to any financial risk or
costs”, what with there being no mini-
mum bar spend, minimum attendance,
stewarding costs and other limitations.
While hosting a “We Are Metric” night
in the Union would require the event to
end at 11pm, Vintage stayed open three
hours later, and the ICHC were able
to negotiate “very favourable drinks
deals” because they supplied their own
DJs.
“The fact that it was an event open
to everyone and not just the Hockey
Club made it a great night”, Jason con-
tinued, adding that Vintage “seemed
pretty receptive to holding more events
in the future” and that “the club is an
extremely nice venue”.
This was the first event of its kind for
this year’s ICHC committee, and the
weather conditions on the night raised
concern for turnout, but Jason told Fe-
lix they were “extremely pleased with
how it went and would probably look to
hold [an event] there again some point
in the future”. ICHC found it particu-
larly interesting that “there were quite
a few people who bought their tickets
on the door, including members of the
public who were just looking to get out
of the snow”. This, in turn, worked in
their favour, as “the mix of ICHC mem-
bers, Imperial students and the public
contributed to an amazing atmosphere
inside”.
Vintage has previously been used by
many Imperial Clubs & Societies for
various events as Chateau 6 before its
rebranding. With an extensive range of
cocktails, its prime location opposite
Fulham Broadway station and numer-
ous rooms for gathering or dancing,
the ICHC executed a fun filled event
for all.
