Lolcat of teh week
So here we are again...
Prepare yourselves for weeks of
campaigning: lecture theatres littered with
sugary bribes and outlandish heartfelt
promises; campus littered with flyers that
really do need recycling.
Things are a little different this year, as
Faculty Union elections are being run at
the same time, so why not take the time
to read up on the latest goings on at
imperialcollegeunion.org/elections?
