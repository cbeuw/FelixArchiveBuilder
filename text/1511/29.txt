Jim has clearly had better days
Better read than Dead
D
eath is a real nuisance.
You can’t move, you
can’t see, you can’t –
well, let’s be honest
here, you can’t do much
at all. The best you can manage is a bit
of basic decomposition, but it’s not re-
ally something to brag about (not that
you can talk anyway). On the plus side
though, you do get some well-deserved
shuteye. That is, unless you’re awak-
ened by a rogue necromancer who runs
monthly entertainment nights for his
undead minions.
This is Mogworld, the debut novel by
Ben “Yahtzee” Croshaw, most famous
for his scathing online video game re-
views and opinion pieces for The Es-
capist. Regular viewers will be able
to pick up on his style of humour very
quickly, though those unfamiliar with
the Australian-based British-born game
reviewer may need to take a chapter or
two to adjust.
Mogworld has been described as what
Terry Pratchett would have written had
he been addicted to video games in his
youth. In his book Yahtzee takes the
magical fantasy genre and tips it on its
head, blending fantasy elements with
his knowledge and passion for gaming.
Not to spoil too much, but the world the
characters inhabit isn’t quite all that it
seems. Maybe you can work it out if I
tell you that the “Mog” of Mogworld
is actually an acronym for something
else…
The choice to write from a first per-
son perspective was a wise decision.
Yahtzee is able to transpose both his
thoughts and his feelings into the pro-
tagonist Jim, an undead low-level mage,
resulting in a character that’s more like
Victor Meldrew than Frodo Baggins.
Jim is an unheroic and irritable char-
acter driven only by a strong desire to
be dead again, constantly irked by his
companions; his mundane thoughts
are at constant odds with the fantasti-
cal world he is forced to inhabit and the
reality shifts he has to face during the
story’s progression.
And yet he still remains a lovable
character. Despite his flaws you can
sympathise with his plight, the only
sane man in a world full of blood-
crazed suicidal barbarians, corrupt
guild officials and terminally depressed
citizens. He’s the straight man, one
you can sympathise with despite his
terminal undead status. He hasn’t got
superpowers, he’s not special, and he’s
as flawed as the next man (or zombie,
if you’d prefer); yet by the end of the
book you find yourself rooting for him
to succeed in his desire to finally “re-
quiescat in pace”.
Juxtaposing Jim is a range of colour-
ful characters that serve to work up his
(congealed) blood pressure, including
Slippery John the inept thief and Barry
the Vicar. By the end of the story most
of the supporting characters’ paths have
intertwined but at no point does it ever
feel forced – they interact with one an-
other seamlessly, despite how utterly
ridiculous everything gets towards the
closing chapters.
One word of advice before picking up
Mogworld: if you can’t tell me what an
MMO is, or what WoW is all about, you
may want to think twice before reading.
Yahtzee has done an excellent job of
balancing general humour against video
game humour, but ultimately many of
the subtler jokes will be missed, and the
overall story, whilst far from complex,
will be better appreciated by those read-
ers who know how to tell their FPSs
apart from their RTSs.
All in all, Mogworld remains one of
my favourite books, funny and some-
what fresh despite some minor repeti-
tion of jokes I’ve already heard from his
online review series. A fun, immersive
read all round.
A moving reminder of simpler times
I know what you’re thinking – sure-
ly this can’t be a review of a se-
ries of children’s stories in Felix.
Well, if the television section can
review My Little Pony I can review
the Nicholas books. Indeed, while
it can classified as children’s lit-
erature, I for one think that the main
appeal of the series is for adults.
Le Petit Nicolas, as the eponymous
protagonist and narrator of the sto-
ries is known in the original French,
was created in 50s by René Goscinny,
best known for his work on the Asté-
rix comics. Goscinny wrote over two
hundred short stories about the red
sweatered seven year old –- first in
the Belgian paper Le Moustique and
later in the highly respected Sud Ouest
Dimanche. It was not long before
these were collected in book form.
Nicholas is an ordinary boy living
in an unspecified city in 50s France.
Each story focuses on a specific epi-
sode in his life – from a school pho-
tograph to his parents buying him a
bike. The humour is derived mainly
from his understandably childlike
first person narration. While
younger readers will cer-
tainly find Nicholas’ ex-
periences, and how he
describes them, funny
it is clear that the sto-
ries are also cleverly
designed to evoke nos-
talgia in older audiences.
Nicholas’ short attention
span, constant falling out with
his friends only to get back
together as if nothing had
happened later the same day
and his general immaturity
serve to pleasantly remind
us of our own childhood.
Another common element
of the stories is commentary
on the absurdities of the adult
world from Nicholas’ young
viewpoint. Descriptions of the
Games editor Laurence Pope reviews Yahtzee Croshaw’s epic MMORPG parody
“Mogworld has been
described as what
Terry Pratchett would
have written had he
been addicted to
video games”
Maciej Matuszewski constant rivalry between
the Nicholas’ father and
his neighbour, Mr Blé-
durt, who are neverthe-
less described by the
boy as “friends”, the
occasional petty quar-
rels between his parents,
and his mother’s empty
threats to move back with
her mother, never fail to
raise a smile. There is
a childlike innocence
and charm to this all
that is very appealing.
Any review of these
books wouldn’t be
complete without a men-
tion of the illustrations.
The name of the illustrator,
Jean-Jacques Sempé, quite
rightly appears on the
“while it can clas-
sified as children’s
literature, I for one
think that the main
appeal of the series
is for adults”
A look back at Le Petit Nicolas – Goscinny and Sempé’s nostalgic masterpiece
books’ covers with equal prominence
to that of Goscinny. His drawings are
a vital addition and complement the
stories perfectly. They are simple, re-
minding you of childlike sketches, but
full of joy and youthful energy. I can’t
imagine how they could capture the
feel of Goscinny’s writing any better.
The stories are very short – most
can be finished in under ten min-
utes, so you can get through them
even if you don’t have a lot of free
time. Indeed, they’re the perfect way
to relax and remind yourself of your
more carefree days. It’s a shame
that the Nicholas stories aren’t as
popular as they should be in Eng-
land but you’ll probably be able to
find them in any bookstore, such as
the excellent Daunt Books, that has
a good children’s and foreign lit-
erature sections. Pleasant reading!
