mperial College TaeKwonDo
(ICUTKD) has returned to its
World Taekwondo Federation
(WTF) roots this year, and recently
entered its first WTF competition
in a long time. On Sunday 5th February,
Brentford Leisure Centre was host to the
Taekwondo London International Open
2012, with competitors from all over the
world – notably a team of specialists,
which included an Olympic athlete from
Korea (the home of the exciting sport.)
ICUTKD put forward a team of six fight-
ers for the intermediate level sparring cat-
egory, and came back strong with a six
medal haul.
At the start of the competition, every-
one was welcomed with a demonstration
given by the Korean team from Yong In
University, one of the top three institutes
dedicated to studying martial arts in Korea.
Throughout the rest of the day we were
able to observe a number of other competi-
tors including European champions and
the aforementioned Korean gaining insight
into their fighting techniques and experi-
ence. With most of the team having started
this year, and being from a wide range of
martial arts backgrounds and abilities, the
London Open served as a good starting
point to their competitive careers, giving
them a great opportunity to put their skills
to the test in a competitive environment.
All the hard work and training paid off,
with everyone winning medals. Inspired
by his chat with the olympian, Bhavesh
Patel was the first to start and went on
to claim bronze. His team-mates were
equally successful, with Mayghal Vijapura
also winning bronze, James Ko and Kaki
Liu winning silver medals, and Roy Lam-
bert winning gold. The most experienced
member of the team, Chris Dancel, also
brought back a gold medal and finished
his final match in style with a technical
knockout that ended the match in a matter
of seconds.
We look forward to our next major com-
petition, this time with other university
clubs at the British Student Taekwondo
Federation (BSTF) national champion-
ships next month. Check out our website,

and videos. We train weekly, on Mondays,
6-9pm in the Union Gym.
