The eagerly awaited BUCS Women’s
Indoor Cricket Championships took
place on a cold January morning at the
world famous Lords Cricket Ground.
After a fantastic performance in
Southampton, the girls were excited
about taking on the tough competition
brought to London by Exeter, Bristol,
Southampton, Birmingham, Lough-
borough, Leeds Met and Durham.
On the day, the team consisted of
Priya Patel (Captain), Celeste Van
den Bosch, Mithila Patkunan (wicket-
keeper), Natalie Jones, Mitali Mishra,
Romi Korotana and Natasha Coral.
After a tense warm up and some nerve-
wracking observations of the bowling
talent being shown off in the next door
nets, as well as the impressive and
sometimes unnecessary size of some of
the opposing teams, Imperial took on
Bristol, who bowled aggressively and
batted well. Sadly, Imperial lost. Our
spirit, however, was not as we watched
an exciting match between Birming-
ham and Loughborough and geared up
to take on the formidable Leeds Met.
There had been some aggressive be-
haviour shown by Leeds Met towards
Bristol, which they did not lessen
against us. Their competitive game
seemed to have worked though, as they
Women’s cricket at Lord’s
also won.
The last match of the day was against
Durham, whose team consisted of
England and county players. Impe-
rial were not hopeful, but were given
a better game by Durham who recog-
nised that we weren’t the strongest
team there though we still managed
to get a couple wickets against them –
an amazing catch by Natasha, bowled
by Priya, and a run-out by our quick
thinking wicket-keeper, Mithila. Dur-
ham also won, and indeed went on to
play Loughborough, their rivals, in
the final and subsequently lost. It must
be pointed out, though, that Lough-
borough’s team consisted of mainly
England players. We were thankful we
weren’t up against them!
Thanks go to our supporters who
turned up with foam fingers and noisy
balloons and who took some great pho-
tos, seen on the Sport Imperial face-
book page. We may have lost, but our
team spirit was definitely the best and
we are more determined than ever to
go back next year and show everybody
what we’re made of!
The ladies in front of the pavillion end... Howzat!

Fencing: Women’s 2nds see off King’s
Fencing
Helen Pennington
Women’s 2nd 135
King’s College 1st 62
On Wednesday, the Women’s 2nd
Fencing Team faced King’s for the 8th
BUCS league match of the season. The
team needed a win to defend their cur-
rent ranking of 3rd place in the league,
and to boost team morale as the two
previous matches had both been loss-
es.The situation initially looked dire,
as one fencer was clearly ill, and two
people were injured from the week be-
fore.
The foil team, composed of Jenifer
Mizen (Jenny), Sarah Chakera, and an-
chored by Stephanie Martinez (Steph),
dominated the piste, taking the lead in
the first match and holding onto it to
win 45-35. After foil, the team fenced
sabre, during which Helen Pennington,
Slavina Georgieva and Jing Quek won
Cricket
Natasha Coral
by an even greater margin, with a fi-
nal score of 45-13. This meant that the
epee team, composed of Helen, Slavi
and Rebecca Razey (Becky), needed
only four points for a draw and there-
fore a technical victory, or five points
to win completely. Helen, Slavi and
Becky fought valiantly, trying to keep
the opposing team with a total score
of less than 60 points. The epeeists
almost, but not quite, met this target.
they won 45-14, producing a final
score of 135-62 to Imperial.
