Black tie for Summer Ball
In a paper brought to Imperial College
Union Council last Monday (February
13) Deputy President (Finance & Servic-
es) Michael Foster outlined plans for this
year’s Summer Ball, which will see the
return of black-tie and a formal dinner.
The event, to be held one week later
than usual on Saturday 23 June, is cur-
rently planned to begin at 5:30pm with
a formal sit-down dinner held in the
Queen’s Tower Rooms. The capacity
for this will be 350 people. Menus and
prices have yet to be confirmed. In or-
der to make the dinner viable, there will
be a minimum attendance figure. If this
figure is not reached by a yet-to-be con-
firmed date, the dinner will be cancelled
and refunds will be provided to those af-
fected.
Though entertainment is also yet to be
confirmed, it is expected that acts will be
spread across the Queen’s Lawn Stage
and the Great Hall, with one headline
act performing on each, accompanied by
support from bands and DJs. Entertain-
ment will run from 8pm until midnight
and tickets will be priced between £25
and £30 pending further budget analysis.
Sit-down formal dinner back on the menu for this year’s event
It is currently planned for one cash bar
to be located in each venue, but should
the number of tickets sold approach
1,500, a cashless system will be consid-
ered.
The fairground also makes a return,
alongside fireworks and the after-party
(priced between £5 and £7), which will
begin at 11pm in the Union building, fin-
ishing at 5am.
In the passed paper (calling for Coun-
cil to agree to the general plan for the
event) Foster writes that the goal for
this year’s event is to be “fun and af-
fordable”. The preliminary budget has
been approved by the Union’s Executive
Committee and a “Summer Ball Forum”
will be organised to receive feedback
from the student body.
Speaking at the Council meeting,
Foster confirmed that this year’s Ball
would see “a return to the style of 2010
and earlier” while maintaining a “very
conservative and low-risk budget”. This
follows last year’s Summer Ball, which
broke from tradition and took the format
of an all-day festival. The event saw ap-
proximately 1,500 tickets sold, after a
projected attendance of 3,850, and saw
an approximate loss of £100,000.
