Embracing diversity in fashion
Munim Islam and Alice Yang interview fashion’s top activist and All Walks founder Caryn Franklin
Dazed, confused and just a little hungry
A
fashion industry expert
for over 30 years having
co-edited i-D magazine,
renowned for its rebellion
to conventional views to-
wards art, fashion and music, and pre-
sented BBC’s The Clothes Show for over
a decade, Caryn Franklin is anything but
your ordinary fashion journalist. With
no less than four books under her name
as well as a range of charitable commit-
ments including Fashion Targets Breast
Cancer, and the recently launched All
Walks Beyond The Catwalk campaign,
Caryn Franklin is an activist, not just
in fashion but in regard to the general
racial, size and age discrimination that
exists in the modern world.
Her latest project, All Walks, found-
ed alongside model Erin O’Connor
and former PR guru/fashion journalist
Debra Bourne
“is an initiative to broaden the body and
beauty ideals we currently see in our
fashion media”. It promotes inclusivity
in the industry “creating a message to all
women”.
Although at first to some, it may seem
like an initiative against the thin ideals
current fashion modelling holds, Ms
Franklin assures us that All Walks was
not designed to discriminate any group
of people:
“We never say ‘real’ women because
very thin models are real too, they’re a
projection of femininity and beauty our
industry prioritises. But they’re not the
only body ideal, which is why we’re
trying to broaden it. We’re not trying
to stamp these women out or get rid
of them, as some seem to think!”
After such a distinguished career in
the industry, Ms Franklin recognises that
there is a lack of ethnic diversity within
fashion. “It’s always been institutionally
racist. Brands will justify it as it’s what
sells. Magazines will be reluctant to
feature black cover girls, because they
feel they don’t equal the magazine sales
of white women. Advertising wants to
reach as many customers as possible
and feels that it is the Caucasian beauty
B
orn in Hertfordshire in
1996, John Rankin Wad-
dell has come much fur-
ther than most ex-account-
ing students, inspiring
millions of people worldwide with his
renowned collection of portraits. From
top models and famous celebrities to the
Queen, all the way to the less glamor-
ous Mugunga refugee camp in Congo,
his hefty Mamiya camera has seen it all.
Yet perhaps Rankin is best known
for the runaway success of Dazed &
Confused, the original cool rebellious
magazine that broke boundaries and in-
troduced unconventional new talent to
the creative industry. Having started out
as a black and white fold-out poster, this
experimental brainchild of Rankin and
Jefferson Hack now sits on the shelves
alongside the industry giants Vogue and
Harper’s Bazaar, becoming a stimulus
for the evolution of newer cult maga-
zines such as i-D and Vice.
20 years on and Rankin’s team have
reunited to bring us the journey of ‘the
magazine that broke all the rules’ in
Dazed & Confused: Making It Up As
We Go Along. Although labelled as a
visual history, this book is far from just
a collection of its controversial cov-
ers and iconic photographs. Rather, its
interviews documenting conversations
between the magazine’s
founders, and its snip-
pets of insight into
the scenes behind the
publication’s glossy
pages, makes this
book so much more
than just an exhibition
of pictures. Such
wise words
from these gi-
ants of the
new gen-
eration of
f a s h i o n
journalism
and pho-
tography
m a k e s
the text
in this
p i c t u r e -
centred book as
valuable as the stark ingenuity the pho-
tographs themselves provide, and that
alone is more than enough to provide a
lifetime’s worth of feverish encourage-
ment to venture upon one’s own mission
to contrive the ravishing imagery which
lives inside each and every one of us.
In fact, it is this blazing need to
continuously express himself, as well
as the realisation that he will for-
ever hold a craving to be inspired
by those around him, that has led
Rankin to his most recent project
Hunger. A darker portrayal
of the visions that eat at
those blessed with
talent, the bi-annual
magazine that is
Hunger is still
in its early days.
But of course,
being Rankin,
the engraved
gold names on
its consuming
debut cover is
already covered
in stars; Dominic
Cooper, Alice Dellal, Cheryl Cole and
Heidi Klum to name just a few. If any-
thing, this is 500 pages affirming that
time has not made Rankin more afraid
Alice Yang embraces her inner rebel as she investigates the quintessential rule-breaking magazine
ideal that sells more for them.”
In fact, Ms Franklin feels that the in-
dustry has shrunk in terms of diversity
and individuality since she entered it in
the 80s when she swapped a life in the
army for art college, in part because the
shoes were “ugly”. As a result of this,
Caryn Franklin’s All Walks models fea-
tures women who would not otherwise
be commonly seen in the industry. From
her current favourite Naomi Shimada,
generally considered a plus-size model
at a UK size 14 that Caryn describes as
a “curvy, sassy, clever model who sees
beyond modelling”; to the 82-year-
old Daphne Selfe and Sheila Atim, an
18-year-old with a “very obvious Afri-
can heritage”, Caryn’s pick of models
for All Walks define diversity.
In the name of promoting such ide-
als, All Walks has merged politics with
fashion, from sparking debates in parlia-
ment, putting on live shows during Lon-
don Fashion Week and creating exhibi-
tions at the National Portrait Gallery, to
touring the country in order to educate
college students. Caryn’s message is
spreading.
“Fashion is full of possibilities and
opportunities. I love the industry. I’ve
earned my living from it, but I can see
its faults and that is why I am vocal.”
Of course to assist with such cam-
paigns, All Walks has pulled in the
precious voluntary time of fashion’s
crème de la crème; from world famous
photographers such as Rankin and Nick
Knight, to the eccentric Vivienne West-
wood – the voice of All Walks Beyond
The Catwalk is most definitely not a si-
lent one.
