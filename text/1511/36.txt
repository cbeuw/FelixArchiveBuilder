The cells in a grid have to be col-
oured or left blank according to
numbers at the side of the grid.
The numbers measure how many
unbroken lines of filled-in squares
there are in any given row or col-
umn. Look at last week’s solution
to see what a typical solution looks
like. The overall solution should yield
some sort of picture, or as good as a
picture can look in monochrome on a
15x15 grid.
