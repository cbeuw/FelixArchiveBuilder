T
he James Bond franchise
(I hate that word) is one
that has been going for 50
years now. It’s amazing
how everything about the
films – from their genre to the charac-
terisation – has evolved and changed
over time. This gradual change in genre
is interesting because it sort of paral-
lels the general changes in society, not
to mention in values. The original film,
Dr. No, as well as the first few, were def-
initely much slower paced. They built
up much more gradually, and there was
much less action. The plot didn’t play
out too quickly; I guess some may say
it was too slow to move on the story,
but that’s all a matter of taste. I would
personally say that the later Bond films
have evolved into being almost an ac-
tion film. At times, they basically are
just a big gunfight. The point I’m ter-
ribly making is this: life is lived today
at a much quicker pace, back when (the
excellent, well, in terms of playing the
part, not in terms of some of his more
abhorrent personal views) Sean Con-
nery was 007, everyone was in less of
a rush – yes, I sound incredibly old...
Each Bond film, in many way, reflects
the era it was made in. It even fell into
the trap of the Blaxploitation era in Live
and Let Die.
Each actor who played Bond brought
something different to the table. Each
Bond was different. Some fundamen-
tal constants remained, but the exact
mix of traits differs wildly from actor
to actor. I may not really have time to
properly dissect each one individually,
so if I leave out your favourite, then it’s
probably due to space restraints.
In the first films Bond was much more
brutal. He was coldly detached, but you
could always sense a hint of moral fibre
in there that the job hadn’t managed to
knock out of him yet. He still retained
the charm and raw attractiveness.
Then you have Roger Moore, who
brought out the super suave side. Al-
though, it must be said, it did get a bit
ridiculous during his tenure. Proof:
a space battle with LASER guns in
Moonraker. A bunch of good and bad
guys have a firefight in spacesuits.
Huh? Is the reaction you’re looking for.
Then it comes to the man that I think
has been unfairly forgotten to a large
extent, Timothy Dalton. His two offer-
ings are two of my favourites. He was
the macho, angry, ruthless spy who had
a job to do and wanted to do the right
thing. His films definitely took the films
in a much darker direction. They were
definitely ‘grittier’, to use the current
buzzword. They still had Q and some
one-liners, however they were more ‘re-
alistic’, as it were. By that I mean rela-
tively – of course the action sequences
weren’t exactly 100% plausible.
Why do I think these films are over-
looked? Maybe it’s because there are
only two of them. Perhaps it’s due to
the massive gap between the second
Dalton film and the first Brosnan film?
Maybe they’re just not good and I just
think they are. It’s hard to tell. I think
it’s more a fact that, in a way, they
were almost ahead of their time. Had
they been made today, everyone would
praise the harder edged, deeper Bond
and the great balance between realistic
and fantastical in the suspended dis-
belief world of Bond. Licence to Kill
was certainly not a fluff action film.
To start with, Felix Leiter, James’ best
friend, has his wife killed and is later
brutally mutilated, with his legs bitten
off by a shark. That’s pretty damn in-
tense. James Bond then goes on a solo
revenge mission against the drug dealer
responsible. He’s angry. Sounds a bit
familiar? In my view, it’s the film that
the terribly titled Quantum of Solace
should have, and could have, been.
It must be said that in my mind Pierce
Brosnan is what James Bond looks like.
I did like his wry humour and that he
injected a lot of levity into the role.
His character was at ease and detached
enough to almost find it all quite fun.
It’s just because he is the one that I have
grown up with. I remember watching
Die Another Day in cinemas. At the
time, to a 12-year-old boy, it was fuck-
ing amazing. Hindsight, and re-watch-
ing it, tells me that maybe I was a bit
hasty in that conclusion. I also didn’t
realize Rocky 3 was ridiculous until see-
ing it again recently; my judgment as a
child was all over the place.
Daniel Craig hasn’t fully proven him-
self to me yet. Casino Royale was great
and a refreshing change in direction. I
feel a bit harsh to dismiss him on the
basis of QOS. It wasn’t his fault that
the script wasn’t good and when asked
what the plot was, most people can’t
give a satisfactory answer.
The take home message, if there is
one, is that each film represents the era
it was made in to some degree. It is a
quite interesting point (yeah I would
say that wouldn’t I? I wrote this after
all) that something as seemingly non-
consequential as films about a badass
spy can throw up a point about how
times have changed. It seems like the
two Timothy Dalton films were a bit
ahead of their time and therefore aren’t
thought of too kindly, but time will
judge them well. Watch The Living
Daylights and Licence to Kill and make
up your mind. You must at least like
the title song to The Living Daylights, I
mean come on, it’s by a-ha.
Look at those blue eyes... swoon...
