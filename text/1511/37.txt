SLITHERLINK
The aim with Slitherlink is to make one
continuous closed loop by connecting
the dots. The numbers in each square
indicate how many edges of the square
are part of the loop, so if it contains a
“2”, you know that two and only two
out of four edges have lines. That’s all
the info you need to get the one
logical answer (though waiting a
week to see the solution will also
do). Answers to puzzles.felix@im-
perial.ac.uk, as the puzzles team
recieves one self-addressed Val-
entines card per correct solution.
If you’d like to contribute by sending in puzzles, comics or even some ed-
iting, e-mail puzzles.felix@imperial.ac.uk. Be they horrendously compli-
cated things or funky picture puzzles you think readers would like, do get
in touch. General suggestions are also welcome.
Contributions wanted!
Having trouble with the
Felix cryptic crosswords
in the sports section? No
idea what it all means or
would like to know why
some answers are as they
are? Contact puzzles.fe-
lix@imperial.ac.uk with
the subject line “Cryptic
Help”. You’ll be sent an
introduction to how cryptic
crosswords work and what
to look out for. Each week
you’ll also receive com-
plete explanations to the
answers in the previous
week’s Felix cryptic cross-
word.
Cryptic Crosswords?
No Thanks!
