Dear Sir
It is always difficult to defend
any illegal activity — anyone
who feels slightly affronted
immediately has a very big stick
to beat you with. C B is illegal,
and will remain so for a while
yet, and I fully realise the
implications of its use. However,
I am sure I am not alone in
thinking of 'he benefits a legal
C B would bring to the country as
it has in many other countries.
M y personal use of any equip-
ment is my look-out, as I can,
indeed, be prosecuted — just in
the same manner as I can be
done for speeding.
M y original intention was, and
still is, to form a social club of
people interested in C B radio to
apply pressure for its legalisation
on 27MHz as soon as possible,
rather than promote illegal
activity, which is up to the
individual.
I have said all I want to say-
about the technical side (FELIX
564) and shall conclude this letter
by saying that if anyone is
interested they can put a letter in
the Meeh Eng letter-racks —

Dear Sir
I have been following the
correspondence on C B with some
interest, a n d having strong
feelings on the matter actually
wrote a letter on the subject last
week. As this would have required
a 99-page F E L I X supplement, it
was not printed, and so I would
like, having squeezed as much
venom and contempt out of them
as possible, to present the main
points here, in the hope that they
constitute a reasonable summary ,
of the pros and cons.
1) If some form of radio
communication between private
citizens was legalised, it would
not only be fun, but useful.
2) The operation of imported
27MHz CB equipment causes
gross interference to the legal
users of not only the 27MHz
band, but to many services
I outside it, e.g. aircraft landing
1
systems, etc (see Government
discussion document ' O p e n
Channel*).
3) Channel 16 is not the only
one causing trouble.
4) Radio Amateurs do not
particularly want "to dominate
the airwaves". We haven't got all
that much frequency space
anyway, considering the number
of people in the world who use it.
5) For simple, friendly local
contacts, 2m F M should suit the
CBers perfectly. A suitable
license is very easy to obtain.
6) Police do not automatically
turn a blind eye to C B operation.
If anyone is really interested in
radio communication and would
like to get involved without
c r a s h i n g aeroplanes or o l d
people's alarms, I would invite
them to come along one Wednes-
day afternoon to H A M S O C ' s
little abode in the Union Building.

Dear Sir
I have been asked to reply to
M a t t h e w H u n t b a c h ' s letter,
printed in F E L I X no 565.
His letter is a hot-potch of
disconnected jottings that served
to warn me of how liberally
afflicted with tunnel vision a
student politician can become.
He writes that the Government
is not 'putting much priority on
profit-sharing' and 'that workers
do not get any direct benefit from
being competitive and thus do
not have any incentive'.
Traditionally firms have paid
higher rates for overtime and
now many are trying to introduce
a productivity element into their
pay seitlements. This is a type of
profit-sharing and certainly
provides an incentive to be
competitive. There is little more
for the Government to do. It has
however enhanced the value of
such arrangements by reducing,
at all levels, the rate of direct
taxation.
He goes on to say that mono-
polies can exist under private
o w n e r s h i p and c o m p e t i t i o n
under public ownership. I agree
but feel bound to point out that,
in this country at least, the
opposite is more likely to apply.
Where this is happening the
Government is aiming to allow
private enterprise to compete.
British Airways is facing competi-
tion from British Caledonian anu
air fares on national routes have
fallen, making prices compare
favourably with corresponding
train fares. This Government has
also given private coach operators
the chance to compete with the
National Bus Company. 'Inter-
City' coach prices have been
reduced, demonstrating that
faith in private enterprise does
not go unrewarded at least not
for you or me — the consumer.
Matthew then goes on to say
that S i r K e i t h J o s e p h was
inhumane to suggest 'that people
should accept lower wages to get
jobs'.
Now an employee is unlikely to
move to a lower paid job. Maybe
Sir Keith meant that an unem-
ployed person should accept
lower wages to get a job. But an
unemployed person receives no
wage so, that doesn't hold. The
implication must therefore be
that an unemployed person
should expect to receive a lower
wage than had previously been
anticipated. This might be good
advice to those who read or hear
about how wage 'claims' 'could'
result in . . . etc. Expectations are
bound to be raised by such
reporting and by the exaggerated
talk of associates. If someone
unemployed pays heed to Sir
Keith's advice then his words will
have borne fruit indeed. Because
there is, as I hope Matthew is
well aware, more to a job than
financial reward.
In the final paragraph it was
c l a i m e d that C o n s e r v a t i v e
policies are 'designed to ensure
that real power and ownership
lies in the hands of a small and
privileged elite' — rubbish.
The continuing intent to sell
council houses, the aim to allow
private enterprise to challenge
state monopolies and the desire
to switch from direct to indirect
taxation show that the Govern-
ment is t r y i n g to give the
c o n s u m e r more e c o n o m i c
freedom, more choice a n d
therefore more control. T h e
Government still has a long way
to go but it has set out in the
correct direction.

Dear Steve,
I would like to reply to M r
Teeloek's somewhat emotive
letter last week with a few points
I consider relevant to the
situation:
1) As I have previously ex-
plained, both decisions regarding
the T V Lounge were made
during Malcolm's term of office
and thus I had assumed he had
informed Snooker Club.
2) He states "for a long time
now, the room has been the
meeting place of Snooker Club".
