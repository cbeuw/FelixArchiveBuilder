Hello, it's time to put pen to paper again. Sorry
about not going to Windsor last week, but we are
definitely going tomorrow, so please all turn up at
the RSM Union Ofice at 9:30am for a little Rag
collecting, Rag Mag selling and a few drinks. Hope
you all enjoyed the fireworks on Wednesday,
sorry about the short notice, but we did not think
of doing it until last weekend.
In Rag Week, there will be our annual fete,
Ragorama, organised by Chaps Club, a Dirty
Disco (schoolgirls and dirty old men) and an all
girl band for only 50p. We need a design for a raft
for the race, piles of rotting matter for Morphy
Day, helpers for the float for the procession and
heaps of enthusiasm to see us through the week.
There will be an RSM trip to see Caligula soon.
See ya. „ . .

Continuing the long-running saga of an ordinary
student's decline into debauchery, RCS proudly
present the thrills, spills, and bills of the start of
Rag Week.
With the Rag Procession being only a week
away, tomorrow and Sunday afternoon are being
given over to construction of the RCS float. Drop
into the RCSU Office any time after 2:00pm both
days and earn your place on the float in the
procession.
The excesses of Rag Week begin next
Wednesday with the Beer Festival all afternoon in
the JCR. If you want some sort of refuge from all
this animal behaviour you can try to find it in the
RCSU Office and help to produce the Broadsheet
'piss up' edition.
Highlight of Thursday is undoubtedly the RCS
Smoking Concert. Help/advice/sketches, etc.,
etc. should all go to the Ents Chairman, Dave
Thompson, Physics 2.
Rag and Drag is on next Friday night and
tickets will be available shortly. Meanwhile I'm
going away to work out some method of avoiding
Exec torture.

The Lord Mayor's Procession tomorrow; if you
join the crowds get there early, to get a good
place, and give the Guilds float a shout.
Tomorrow evening is the Guilds/IF Kiddies
Party. The idea is to dress up as an under 10; if
you don't, there is a 25p surcharge on top of your
50p ticket, which you can get from the Guilds
Office. You also need to bring a bottle. The party
starts at 8:00pm in the JCR.
Don't miss the UGM on Tuesday. We'll have
some fun and games for you (and so might "you
know-who").
Then Rag week starts on Wednesday fnuff
said).

This is the title of a book you should be seeing
quite a lot round College next week. It's written
by David Watson, and the question is addressed
to the supernatural realm, where many people
maintain that God exists. The book looks at
whether, with mankind and the world in its
present state, it is reasonable to take seriously the
suggestion that God does exist. It also examines
the ways that Christians claim that God has
communicated with us, predominantly through
Jesus Christ. If God does exist, and is interested
in people, this has important consequences for
us, and the book looks at how we can relate to
God, and how He has made this possible, and
what we should do about it.
You've probably guessed by now that the book
in being distributed by IC Chrisian Union; we
have found in our own experience that what
David Watson talks about is true, and we don't
want to keep it to ourselves, so why not get hold
of a copy? It will be on bookstalls in departments
and the JCR during the ICCU Bookweek, next
Monday to Friday; the cost is £1.00, but if the
grant is wearing thin, talk to someone nicely and
they might give you one!
On the subject of questions, we've also
arranged a talk next Thursday, November 13 at
6:30pm in Civ Eng 207 on the subject Is Reality
Possible?

Science Fiction
Society
The society's attempt to shorten the impending
thirty thousand years of anarchy caused by the
continuing publication of Omni proceeds apace
(from the Latin " a pace" meaning " t o the
peace"). This Friday, November 7, in Southside
Upper Lounge, at 1:00pm (this boy knows how to
build up suspense) ICSF sock will be (he's still at
it) selling (wait for it) PERIHELION, the first issue
of our new organ (hence the number 6 on the
front), a limited edition all signed by the secretary.
Yes, Perihelion 6, the magazine which does for SF
criticism what Larry Niven did for Christian
Barnard. We would have charged £1, but we
decided not to gloss the pages, so it only costs
30p (20p for members). Perihelion 6, the
magazine of which Christopher Priest said: "I
think I've got one of those already".
Coming soonish: a really triffic film from the
man who brought you MASH, California Split,
Nashville, etc — Robert Altamn. QUINTET —
the show that really hits the ice. To keep their
minds off the cold produced by the onset of the
next ice age, five people decide to kill Paul
Newman. As Sir Robert Mark once said: "I'm
convinced it's a major contribution to road
safety".
