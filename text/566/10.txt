RSM Football
AFTER a great start by RCV (they won the
toss) the game kicked off, under the direction
of the ref, new to the game. Inspired by this
RSM started to play some decent football and
bar a few misunderstandings between the ref
and the laws, RSM managed to score the first
goal, well taken by T Hanker. This brought
RCV (and the ref) to action and for a while
RSM defended well though not well enough
since RCV scored to make the goal tally
equal. With the ref now venturing from the
centre circle both teams were spurred on to
even greater efforts by this show of
confidence, and soon after RSM got another
goal, this time from James W.
Football Seconds
TWO BEDFORD goals mid-way through the
second half made IC fight to win a match
which should have been won easily.
IC dominated the first half, without creating
many clear cut chances and at half-time the
score was 0-0.
Soon after the break, however, Clarke shot
fiercely from a narrow angle to give IC the
lead. The team began to play with confidence
and went further ahead when Veenman
slotted his shot past the approaching keeper.
Two well taken Bedford goals, drew the
score level at 2-2.
With the possibility of a draw against such
mediocre opposition, IC stepped up the effort
once more and regained the lead when Carr
heapfe'd a lose ball over a stranded keeper. IC
finally finished off the opposition when a shot
from Niccolls entered the net.
TEAM: Veats, Curran, Beer, Armstrong,
MacDonald, Griffiths, Carr, Niccolls,
Veenman, Clarke, Saunders.
Guilds Hockey
A F T E R a well-contested start in which
Goldsmiths looked a competent team, Forbes
opened the scoring with rather a limp shot. In
minutes, Guilds were two up with a short
corner put away by Andy Liles. Guilds
pressed forward and were rewarded by a
somewhat dubious goal from Gray. Gold-
smiths lost a man at half-time and Guilds
controlled the game for the rest of the match,
with Andy Liles completing his hat-trick from
short corners. Andy Garms and Chris Liles
also netted in neat solo efforts. Guilds missed
a lot of chances but overall it was a good team
effort.
TEAM: Hancox, Shaw, Rao, Black, Eldridge,
Liles A, Forbes, Garms, Gray, Liles C. Driver
and ref, Webb P.

RCS Rugby
SINCE so many people want to play in our
one team, it was decided to play a Saturday
match for those people who weren't regulars.
A team of 12 eventually took the field
against an ageing 14-man BP team. Phil
Morgans and Ian Mawer proved to be too fast
for the opposition backs, and were rewarded
with three and one tries respectively.
Morgans proved as elusive in the bar as he
was on the field, and avoided buying a hat-
trick jug. Dave Fenton scored his first (and
probably last) try of the season, three
conversions and a penalty were kicked by
Skipper Latham. Chris Boyd made his
presence felt in the back row, and was not
responsible for either of the two tries scored
against us.
We spent a pleasant hour in the clubhouse
after the match, and my thanks to those
heroes who turned out: Edwards, Curnock,
O'Doherty, Pilgrim, Morgans, Mawer,
Latham, Pearce, Fenton, Ellwitt and two
Smiths.
Football Sevenths
THE NEWLY FORMED IC VII team slammed
seven goals past LSE Vths in a 7-3 victory.
The team quickly began to perform as a well
c o o r d i n a t e d unit, putting L S E u n d e r
pressure. IC went two nil up with fine goals
from Bartolomasi and Martin. At this stage
LSE staged a comeback, and as IC relaxed
they scored three quick goals to lead 3-2 at
half-time, having forced Rijnbeek into making
to fine saves.
As the second half wore on IC gained a
stranglehold on midfield, where the main
battle was being fought, and were able to set
up many attacks with only twenty minutes
remaining Caseau levelled with a header.
Then Milner put IC 4-3 up. Further goals from
Milner and centre-half Haberlin (2) ensured
an emphatic win for IC. This was a good,
confident display from IC VII and demo-
strates the high quality of football at IC this
year.
T E A M : Rijnbeek, Wilson (sub Bird),
Maynard, Know, Haberlin, Caseau, Gaskill,
Martin (sub Twyford), Milner, Bartolomasi,
Coussens.
Hockey Firsts
I C S THIRD G A M E this season in the
Middlesex League turned out to be their
toughest fixture so far.
From the start O M T s were obviously
determined to get a result from this game and
attacked hard and fast. But for the first ten
minutes IC gave as good as they got and
| eventually scored through a well struck shot
corner from Ian Crowe.
Then IC made the mistake of relaxing and
by half-time OMTs had been allowed control
of the game and had scored twice to take the
lead.
Positional changes at half-time strength-
ened IC's midfield and saw them gradually
claw their way back into the match. About
fifteen minutes from the end, IC levelled the
score with a perfectly executed short corner
through Ian Crowe.
For the last ten minutes IC really dominated
the match and were unlucky several times not
to score the winning goal.
T E A M : Webb, Crowe, Hughes, Coates-
worth, Riley, Whitaker, Clarke, Franklin,
Gatley, Ayres, Rich.
Hockey Seconds
THE SECONDS extended their 100% record
last Saturday in a hard fought match in which
the IC goalkeeper was constantly kept under
heavy pressure. IC had great difficulty in
breaking down a well regimented Howden
defence, and it was not until after thirty
seconds that we managed to open the
scoring.
After this, despite centre forward Spanker
doing his best to miss the goal, IC soon
increased their lead, with Streaker scoring a
stonker of a goal.
The second half started much like the first,
with the IC goalkeeper again being kept very
busy.
Full time came with relief, the 13-0
scoreline telling the full story of what a hard
fought battle it had been.
Special mention must go to Mike Chew and
Andy Garms who scored five goals each, ana
to Lloyd Williams who sportingly played in
goal for the opposition.
TEAM: Williams, Parker, Rampton, Bird,
Shaw, Chew, Garms, Rao, Streaker, Gray,
Shindter, Masom.
Squash
AT LAST, IC Squash Club has four good
courts. We have four teams in the U L U
leagues with a ladies' team hopefully joining
the ladies' league after Christmas. The
standard of all the teams is, as usual, fairly
high, with the thirds making a very good start
to the season. However, we have still to
assess the ability of several people, so don't
despair if you haven't played for a team yet.
Thanks to swift Jacqueline Chandler for
organising the ladies and to all the squash
socialites of last Thursday.

Snooker
THE B TEAM returned to form and beat

confident about this week's encounter with
the C team. Training for all B team members
