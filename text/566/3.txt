have been gaining unfair advan-
tage by this process ( n o t a b l y
G u n n e r ridden by H u r d y G u r d y ) .
However, I digress. M r M o r t o n
had no intention of offending two
such illustrious Associates of the
R o y a l C o l l e g e o f S c i e n c e as
Messrs Fox and O ' B o y l e . M r
M o r t o n believes that his sources
of idiosyncratic inspiration are at
least as good, if not better than,
those of Fox and O ' B o y l e . H e
t h e r e f o r e b e l i e v e s t h a t these
gentlemen would be proud to
have their names associated with
such an event and that their
demand for an apology is both
u n w a r r a n t e d a n d p r e m a t u r e .
J u d g e by the event, Fox and
O ' B o y l e . M r M o r t o n is certain it
will be up to your own idiosyn-
cratic standards and an apology
for using your names will be
issued if it is not.
M r M o r t o n hopes the doubting
tone of the letter from Fox and
O ' B o y l e will not prevent entries
flooding in for the race. W e will
show how well we can manage
without them!

H e a d L a d to M r M o r t o n ' s Stable
F o r t w o w e e k s i n a r o w
( F E L I X 565 and 566), you have
p u b l i s h e d i n y o u r E d i t o r i a l s
untrue and actionable statements
about me, presented as if they
were facts and mixed with your
characteristic 'presumably's and
hearsays. While it is not worth
my time to comment on your
p r e s u m p t i o n s , it is a b s o l u t e l y
n e c e s s a r y to c h a l l e n g e y o u r
' f a c t s ' a n d set t h e r e c o r d s
straight.
O n 2 1 / 1 0 / 8 0 , I received a call
from I C U H o n Sec (E Lindsay)
asking who would be seconding
my motion at the U G M . In the
discussion that followed (over the
phone and in the U n i o n Office
less than five minutes later), I did
N O T say, or give the impression,
that M a r y Attenborough had
backed out' of anything. T h e r e
was a witness present. I therefore
c h a l l e n g e y o u to s u b s t a n t i a t e
your aspersion that the contrary
is true.
M a r y herself savs she did not
'back out'. Y o u have alleged in
print'that she did. Therefore, the
onus is on you to produce any
concrete evidence you may have
to s u p p o r t y o u r p o s i t i o n . B y
publishing the d a m a g i n g state-
ment in your Editorial, you have
erred on points of fact and of law.
A n d if you have any knowledge
of I C U constitutional documents
at all, you would accept that the
F E L I X E d i t o r is responsible for
facts in his Editorial, irrespective
of the initial source of his alleged
m i s - i n f o r m a t i o n . It is u n -
believable that an Editor should
claim he is not responsible for a
statement he wrote and published!
A n y decent Editor, if he c o m -
mitted the blunder at all, would
have apologised to M a r y by now.
S i n c e y o u h a v e so far not
p r o v e d y o u r s e l f s u f f i c i e n t l y
conversant with the basic prin-
ciples and practice of responsible
journalism, one should not take
seriously your latest attempt to
dabble in matters of law. Indeed
it is astonishing that someone
w h o has p u b l i s h e d n u m e r o u s
actionable Editorials and lead
stories should^hint of litigation.
People who live in glass houses
are better advised not to throw
stones recklessly.
If you want to debate the issue
f u r t h e r — I've no t i m e for
trivalities — you can take me up
on the pages of F E L I X or on the
lloor of the U G M . I shall accept,
provided there is a guarantee of
equal writing space or speaking
time lor each side, with neither
cheating. F o r one side to mis-use
office by publishing his views
while preventing the reply of the
o t h e r f r o m b e i n g p r i n t e d is
c o w a r d l y , u n a c c e p t a b l e a n d
unconsitutional.

Ed's Comment
D e a r Dennis,,
I regard you as a compulsive liar of
the most detestable kind. O n the
last day for accepting motions, L i z
Lindsay received a call from you in
which you said that although you
had not asked M a r y Attenborough
" y o u felt sure she would agree to
second the motion". Liz tried to
phone M a r y , but was unable to
contact her. Just before the closing
d e a d l i n e y o u r a n g b a c k a n d
w i t h d r e w M a r y a n d suggested
someone called Fernando.
I resent your letter and all of
your other letters, and I don't like
the way you have treated M a r y in
this matter; I think you owe her an
apology.
I too have no time for trivialities
and hence I have no wish to discuss
the matter (whatever it is!) any
further.
Y O L J elected me to Office and
Y O U have the power to remove
me, why don't you exercise your
rights? I regard you as a crackpot
and will tolerate you no longer.
Y o u may consider your right of
reply in print to this comment
u n a c c e p t a b l e a n d u n c o n s t i t u -
tionally withdrawn in a cowardly
manner if vou like.

-Dancing to the 'Monster Mash' at this year's Halloween Party-
Perennial favourite of ghoul and disco freak alike, the Halloween Party
was again crowded with merry-makers. Tony West's Acme Disco kept
things moving, and the witching hour passed without the bat of an eyelid
(or the eyelid of a bat?). See you at next year's reincarnation.
