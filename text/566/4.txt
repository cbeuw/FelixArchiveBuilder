IC Radio
There's a new half hour Droqramme on IC Radio
from this Friday evening. Going by the name of
"Don't Touch That Dial", it's a collection of
music, interviews and features that you won't
hear anywhere else — definitely! A team of eaoer
young radio journalists from the London College
of Printing are putting the programme together,
and they'll welcome your views and comments on
how you'll like the show. Tune in at 8 o'clock for an
earful
The first programme includes a feature on
Kinky Friedman the first Jewish country and
western star, a report on cannabis growing in
France with the Government's blessing, and hints
on how to cut a dash this winter in the latest
urban guerrilla outfits.
PG Football
Although a postgrad football tournament
would, by necessity have to played outside of a
bed, we don't really expect the standard to be
very high, the point is that people enjoy playing.
Many postgrads have difficulty in getting away
during the afternoon so that an indoor five-a-side
competition may be most feasible for this term; in
addition there are a number of eleven-aside
teams who would welcome offers of games. All
this requires organisation, so as a start maybe
interested individuals could come along to our
meeting oh Monday, November 10 at one o'clock
in the Senior Common Room (in the Union
Building) where hopefully we can get some idea of
the n u m b e r s i n v o l v e d , and the k i n d of
arrangements which would suit people best;
anyone who is interested but has an aversion to
meetings should leave a note for me, care of

Last Week's Competition
Thanks for the flood of entries to the "What I
would do with £500 of Union money if John
Passmore had not got to it before I could"
essay competition. After sifting through all of
the entries I have finally decided on the
following two joint winners; prize £2.50 each.
- Ed.
Dear Steve
What would I do if I had got my hands on
the £500 of Union money before John
Passmore? Well. I would have bought a new
set of shirts and started running a second
rugby team. Then I would be able to give a
game.to all the ex-Gaelic footballers who
now want to play rugby because they have
realised that, however well John Passmore
organises a team, there are no pitches,
referees or opposition within 300 miles of
London.

RCSA Careers
The R C S A is organising a Careers Brains Trust
on Thursday, November 20 at 6:30pm in the J C R
Sherfield. This is an informal evening with free
refreshments. The event aims to give final-year
students an opportunity to talk with old students
about jobs, careers and prospects in the outside
world.
Representatives will be present from a wide
range of occupations and at many levels; from
industry, schools, commerce and government,
and in management, research, sales, finance, etc.
This should be very informative even if you
already know what you want to do next year.
In Memoriam, £500 of Union Money
So fare* sll then, £500, of Union money,
A sum trivial
W h e n compared to
Far
Larger sums spent on
J C R refarnishing
M y friend Keith
Says House Committee
Decided
Not to
Furnish the J C R
All at once
But it
Was done anyway
Democracy is a
Wonderful
Thing.
Perhaps the
Most democratic
Use of Union money
Would be
The one taken advantage of
By most IC students,
Maybe
Providing more T V s
For Southside residents
O r even
A tedious
J C R booze up.
M y friend Keith's mum
Suggests that we

Episode One
At the railway station the 10:30p.m. express
from Southend was late. The porters weeded
the flowerbed — it had not been done for
some while. A passenger sat conspicuously
alone.
"How do you print tickets?" asked Aunt
Deidre at the appropriate office.
"With a machine," replied the belligerent officer.
Far from being put off, Aunt Deidre continued with
her enquiries, but the clerk turned disinterestedly
away.
