This article is written to reveal some of the difficult situations
that o v e r s e a s s t u d e n t s , g r a d u a t e s in particular, are now
f a c i n g u n d e r the p r e s e n t s y s t e m . A l t h o u g h my o w n
experience is being referred to, some points like high tuition
fees and the work permits are relevant to most overseas
students.
Mark Wong outlines the difficulties faced by
overseas IC graduates when applyingfor a job
in this country.
I came to Britain four years
ago from H o n g K o n g (a British
colony). As I was born in H o n g
K o n g I have a British passport
^i.e. British nationality) but I
am a British subject, not a British
citrjn: therefore I a m classified
as an overseas student. I came
to I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e to d o
c h e m i c a l e n g i n e e r i n g a l t e r I
f i n i s h e d m y A l e v e l s i n o n e
year. I have learnt a lot, not 1
o n l y a c a d e m i c a l l y , these f o u r
years. I like this country and I
have made a lot of friends. I feel
accepted by most of the people
I have met, so I think I could
s e t t ' " i n this c o u n t r y . In m y
final year, I decided to settle
d o w n here and make a career in
chemical engineering. It is not
o n l y b e c a u s e there a r e m o r e
o p p o r t u n i t i e s for a c h e m i c a l
e n g i n e e r h e r e t h a n in H o n g
K o n g , hut I can also contribute
more from both my education
a n d cultural background.
I joined the m i l k r o u n d and
looked for a suitable job. After
some consideration, I chose a
list o f n i n e c o m p a n i e s , a l l of
them were oil companies, c h e m -
ical manufacturers or chemical
engineering contractors. H o w -
ever, I encountered a problem
in getting a j o b , a n d that is, I
have to have a work permit in
o r d e r to be e m p l o y e d . A n
employer who is interested in
e m p l o y i n g a n overseas worker
like m y s e l f c a n a p p l y to the
H o m e Office on behalf of the
o v e r s e a s w o r k e r for a w o r k
permit. H o w e v e r , the overseas
worker has to at least satisfy a
list of regulations laid d o w n by
the H o m e Office. In the past, it
was difficult but still possible to
get a work permit. In 1979, a
new legislation c a m e in m e a n i n g
t h a t t h e a p p l i c a n t o v e r s e a s
worker of the work permit must
be over the age of 23. T h i s rule, to
me, is put in just to stop most of
the overseas graduates getting a
j o b h e r e . T h e r e a r e o t h e r
r e g u l a t i o n s l i k e the e m p l o y e r
h a s to a d v e r t i s e the j o b i n
Britain a n d other E E C countries
a n d show that he has no suitable
candidate from this country or
other. E E C country.
I w a s w a r n e d m a n y t i m e s
that it was likely to be extremely
d i f f i c u l t t o o b t a i n a w o r k
permit. Despite this, I went to
the first r o u n d of interviews. A
couple of companies didn't even
give me a first interview. O n e of
these companies stated clearly-
in the letter that it was because
they would not be able to get
me a work permit. I was turned
d o w n by another two companies'
after first interviews probably
also because of the work permit
p r o b l e m . Nevertheless, I received
s e v e n i n v i t a t i o n s f r o m f i v e
companies (some of these c o m -
p a n i e s h a v e s u b s i d i a r i e s a n d
divisions) so, the first r o u n d of
interviews 'was successful given
m y problem. T h e second round
of interviews was also reasonably
successful a l t h o u g h the w o r k
permit issue was inevitably raised
a n d discussed. T h i s issue was
certainly taken into account by
the employer before they decided
whether to offer me a j o b or not.
A t the end, I had three offers of
employment: one from an oil
c o m p a n y and the other two from
the same but different parts of an
international oil a n d chemical
c o m p a n y . I then made up m y
m i n d to j o i n the international oil
a n d chemical giant. A good deal
of effort was then put in by the
c o m p a n y to p r e p a r e for the
application of m y work permit. I
remained in L o n d o n after the
third year exams to wait for the
outcome of the application. T h e
bad news came in e a r l y j u l y when
the H o m e Office turned down my
a p p l i c a t i o n . T h e c o m p a n y
informed me of the result and that
we had the right to appeal against
the H o m e Office decision. A week
later, I got in touch with the
c o m p a n y a g a i n a n d I w a s
surprised and disappointed to
hear that the c o m p a n y , after
a week of careful consideration
would not appeal on m y behalf
because the chance of success
was extremely slim. T h e y could
do nothing but to withdraw the
offer of employment.
I just don't understand why I
should not be allowed to take
up the j o b here when I have
had four years of good education.
There are employers looking for
good graduates, there are e m -
p l o y e r s w h o c o u l d not f i n d
s u i t a b l e c a n d i d a t e s for t h e i r
vacancies and there are people
like myself being offered a job
but not allowed to take it. E v e n
if there were no s h o r t a g e of
chemical engineers, some large
companies can certainly absorb
more than they need and m a n -
p o w e r is o n e o f t h e m o s t
important assets of a company.
T h e fact that I was offered a j o b
d i d not m e a n that a B r i t i s h
citizen was thrown out of work
or prevented from taking up a
job.
D e s p a i r e d w i t h the H o m e
Office decision, I came back to
College and tried to obtain a
scholarship or sponsorship to do
a further degree; by this time,
my degree was known — a very
good second upper.
I r a n i n t o d i f f i c u l t y a g a i n
because I a m not eligible for a
S R C g r a n t a n d m y fa m i l y
cannot afford m y fees and living
expenses (Tuition fees for over-
seas students at Imperial College
are £3,000pa for session 198071,
a m i n i m u m sum of £2,700pa as
living expenses is recommended
by the L o n d o n Conference on
Overseas Students in consultation
w i t h the B r i t i s h C o u n c i l . ) It
w o u l d be d i f f i c u l t to ask a n
industrial sponsor to pay £ 5 , 7 0 0
a year to support a student for a
further degree, as he might as
w e l l e m p l o y the s t u d e n t a n d
give h i m £5,500pa salary. I was
fortunate enough to get a fees
r e m i s s i o n f r o m the O v e r s e a s
Student Fees Support Scheme.
P r a c t i c a l l y f o r t h e 1 9 8 0 / 1
session I had only need to pay
£ l , 1 0 5 p a , as the tuition fees as I
limited myself to those projects
and courses which have money
attached to them. I a m grateful
t h a t I c o u l d f i n d s o m e t h i n g
interesting and be sponsored to
do it.
However, there are many sell-
sponsored students, both post- •
g r a d u a t e a n d u n d e r g r a d u a t e ,
who cannot afford the high fees.
It m e a n s that m a n y c a p a b l e
students who are interested in
doing research and being edu-
c a t e d are l o s i n g t h e i r o p p o r -
tunities. F r o m the College point
of view, it may mean a sub-
stantial decrease in the intake of
overseas students. Currently 46%
o f p o s t g r a d u a t e s t u d e n t s at
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e c a m e f r o m
overseas. C a n the College afford
losing half of this 46% of overseas
students?
