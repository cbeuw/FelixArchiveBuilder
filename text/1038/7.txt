The most
distinguishing
feature of the
London Motor Show
is its size. Not only
is the venue huge,
but the number of
cars on display gets
larger each year.
From the smallest
to the biggest, what
you want is there.
Top: Lotus Elise, price approx. £23,000
Above: Daewoo Nexia, price approx. £9,000
Above Right: Alfa Spicier, price to be anounced.
The Earls Court site was rough-
ly divided into 'cheap' and 'expen-
sive' exhibition areas. The many
new models on display include: the
Chrysler Jeep, Citroen's new Xantia
Estate, Ferrari's F50, the Fiat Bravo,
Ford's Fiesta, Honda's Civic,
Hyundai's Lantra, the Land Rover
Discovery XS, Mercedes brand new
E - series, Peugot's 806 and 406
range, Porsche's 911, the advanced
Rover MGF, Vauxhall's new space-
machine, the Vectra and the Volvo
850 series.
A particular coup for Saab this
year was their exhibit of the revo-
lutionary 'sensonic' gearing system.
This essentially is a manual trans-
mission gear box which does away
with the need for a clutch. A very
personal decision as to whether you
want to use this bizarre system.
Not only were the cars of inter-
est, but the diverse marketing
methods employed by the various
manufacturers were also entertain-
ing. If you're a fan of reworked 70's
hits in the Gary Glitter style, you'd
better mosey on over to the
Vauxhall stand. For the freebie fans,
many of the promo stalls were giv-
ing away free information packs,
posters, bags and so forth.
A few points of note:
Daewoo claims to have shifted
9,000 cars in six months and trum-
pets "the most successful launch
ever". Further, on Wednesday, an
anonymous buyer purchased a clas-
sic Jaguar D-type for £1 million.
There is a good selection of "classic"
cars, and as increasing number of
sports cars on show. Strangely
enough, Volvo has joined the ranks
of the sports models with the 850.
If you have a spare hundred thou' or
so, don't waste it on a Mercedes
600SL (£107,000), they're over-
priced and rather vulgar. The 300
series however, is elegant and well
worth a look.
The Motor Show continues
until Sunday, but a full tour takes
several hours to get the most of the
hefty £9 price tag (without conces-
sions). Also, with the astronomical
food prices, this show is really only
for those who love cars (and tens of
thousands of people).
