ICU Cinema
Just two films this week, but what films
they are! The themes: men, mountains, and
madness, we start on Wednesday with The
Englishman Who Went up a Hill But Came
Down a Mountain, the man - Hugh Grant,
the mountain - somewhere in Wales, and
the madness... well what can I say? But
despite the absurd title it is an excellent
film, telling a moving true story set in
wartime Wales. Grant shows all the charm
and eccentricity of his earlier films. The film
also stars Tara Fitzgerald (of Sirens) and
Colin Macrey.
On Thursday we will be showing The
Madness of King George, a mountain of a
man, who had a few mental problems! Good
British films are few and far between, but
Nigel Hawthorne (of Yes Minister fame)
was nominated for an Oscar in this excellent
adaptation of Alan Bennett's stage play.
Both films start at 8 pm, doors open ten
minutes before the show.

Well, we think its time for icsf to get
underway this year properly, so we are
starting with our freshers event! Yes, we
know its now the end of the fourth week,
but hey! no self respecting student should be
arguing with free grub.
As well as the food, we will be showing
the first 2 episodes of "The X-Files" on vid:
the pilot and "Deap Throat". The fun and
cynicism starts at 7 pm in STOIC on the top
floor of the Union (thanks STOIC!), and
membership is £4 for the year.
As well as having events on Tuesday
evenings, our LIBRARY is up and running
every lunch-hour (12.30 - 1.30), where you
can borrow from our eclectic selection of
over 3000 books, graphics and vids. The
Library is under Biology West Wing.
