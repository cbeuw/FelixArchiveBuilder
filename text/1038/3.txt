NEWS FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 2 7 T H 1 9 9 5 . THREE
Pill Scare Rocks Health Centre
BY M A R K BRIDGE
Dr. Irene Weinreb, Director
of the Health Centre, has issued
a notice to Felix in response to
the recent publicity concerning
the risks associated with some
combined oral contraceptives.
The centre has been inundated
with calls since the disputed
research findings were made
public last week.
The controversial brands are
Mercilon, Marvelon, Femodene,
Femodene ED, Tri-Minulet,
Minulet, and Triadene.
Staff at the College Health
Centre say they are not con-
vinced of the increased risks
associated with the new proges-
terones in these products (the
studies have not been published
and reviewed yet). Dr. Weinreb
explains '...users are already
screened for risk factors before
prescriptions are written, min-
imising the effective risks'.
They stress that women should
not stop taking the pill and
should finish their current pack-
et, however the centre is obliged
to ask people who obtain their
pills from them to change to
another product.
Those who get contracep-
tives elsewhere should discuss
their situation with their GP or
Family Planning Clinic.
The Health Centre also
issued guidelines advising their
patients to take one of the fol-
lowing courses of action:
• Collect a prescription for three
_ months' supply of other brand
pills, plus an additional informa-
tion sheet on how to change over.
Then, within two months, make
an appointment to see a doctor
or nurse.
• Make an appointment to see
one of the doctors or practice
nurses.
• Attend one of the doctors' or
nurses' open clinics.
The Centre say they are
happy to answer enquiries, but
ask that they be made on week-
days between 12 and 12.30 or 3
and 3.15pm.
Oestrogen Pills and Thrombosis:
a Brief History
In the 1950's oestrogen was
found to inhibit ovulation when
taken in regular daily doses.
Oestrogen normally thickens the
endometrium (uterus) wall and
prevents other eggs from matur-
ing while an egg is active.
Unfortunately complications
such as thrombosis sometimes
developed. Searches for safer
alternatives led to various drugs
with low or no oestrogen con-
tent. These were variably suc-
cessful.
The most promising work
was with progesterone. This hor-
mone, which normally allows fer-
tilised cells to multiply and grow
in the uterus, was also found to
inhibit ovulation, though less
reliably than oestrogen.
Current low dose oral con-
traceptives are based on mix-
tures and improvements of syn-
thetic versions of these hor-
mones. A n as yet unconcluded
European study seems to indi-
cate that low dose oral contra-
ceptives are still associated with
a small risk of thrombosis gener-
ally.
However third generation
synthetic progesterones have
been linked to higher incidence
of thrombobsis when they are
compared to previous generation
progesterones such as levonge-
strol.
Research
Disputed
The research findings that
have sparked off international
alarm are still disputed. The as
yet unpublished report from the
World Health Organisation has
found that third generation syn-
thetic progesterones, degestrol
and gestodene, have been found
to cause an increase of about
0.0001% in incidents of (venous
thromboembolism) blood clots
in the leg and/or lungs.
The report was circulated to
various governments around the
world. The U.K. Department of
Health, the first government
body to react to the report, sent
doctors a directive to deal with
the issue on Wednesday last. In
a separate development the
German government announced
that they would be reviewing
their position on the drugs this
Sunday night.
The project director of the
WHO research stressed that
there was no need for the alarm
that had been generated. The
risk with these third generation
progesterones is greater than pre-
vious ones, but the risk of blood
clot formation is in actual fact
very small (0.0002%).
The W H O constitution
requires safety and choice to be
paramount in fertility regulation,
as for other aspects of human
health. Other quarters take a
different view, with the U.S.
National Research Council call-
ing on their government to relax
regulations arguing "Given the
potentially serious health conse-
quences of unwanted pregnancy
resulting from contraceptive fail-
ure, methods with fewer side
effects are not necessarily safer if
they have higher failure rates".
Doctors, who have to imple-
ment these often conflicting
principles in the real world, are
left to strike a balance between
the various risk factors and the
needs of their patients.
