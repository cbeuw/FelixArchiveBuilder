Fears that the visit of Michael Portillo on Wednesday would be inter-
rupted by Left Wing Activists proved unfounded. His appearance was
only marred by the inability of certain students to gain access to the
overcrowded lecture hall.
Estates Back Down
on Sherfield Move
BY ALEX FEAKES
College authorities announced
this week that plans to move the
Union to the Sherfield building
were 'on hold' following fears
over the rising costs for the
scheme. The Rector, Sir Ronald
Oxburgh, told a meeting of the
Governors last Friday that the
projected expenditure was spi-
ralling out of control beyond the
original budget.
The architects, Sir Norman
Foster and Partners, came up
with the designs for the area
around the Queen's Lawn, to cre-
ate a "centre of dawn to dusk
activity." Ian Caldwell, Director
of Estates, said "the costs appear
to be higher than we feel com-
fortable with... especially to meet
the brief [setting out the Union's
minimum requirements]." Other
sources say that costs are up to
five times over the budget of
approximately Â£3 million, and no
new money can be found.
When asked about the deci-
sion to put the move on hold, Ian
Caldwell replied that " I C U are

Contraceptive Pill Scare provokes Strong Reaction
Imperial College Health Centre
has been inundated with tele-
phone calls this week as contro-
versial new research suggests that
certain contraceptive pills are
highly dangerous. The national
media converage given to the
report has provoked a reaction
from worried staff and students.

move... Also, the costs are quite
high, so the move has to be finan-
cially justifiable." He stressed
that the College wanted to pro-
vide student facilities that would
be the 'envy of many colleges',
but he insisted that funding for
the scheme would have to be
recovered from increased accom-
modation revenue in Beit Quad.
ICU President Sarah White
said that the decision was "won-
derful news". She added that the
Rector had given I C U the chance
to push for the 'Beit Option', and
to emphasise the advantages and
savings from staying there. She
was adamant that the Union had
pressed the importance of keep-
ing the range of its facilities with
the architects, and their proposal
reflected this, coming in way
over the 'unrealistic' budget for
the plan and still only just accept-
able.
Talking about the Union's
ideas for Beit, Ian Caldwell said
"We are having a quick look at
that as an option". However, he
iterated that there would have to
be changes 'to keep the distur-
bances down', including moving
the exit to the north side of the
building and some acoustic
remodelling of the inside to
reduce the noise. He expressed
surprise at the "affinity that the
people involved had for their cur-
rent 'homes'" and the strength of
feeling about the move.
