Dear Editor,
I am writing to question strongly
the verdict reached by the Union
Disciplinary against the Rag
Chair, Mr Richard Willis.
The fresher involved in the
incident, according to the report
pubished in Felix, was seen pur-
chasing a pint of strong cider in
Da Vinci's Bar, after leaving the
rag meeting. May I point out that
before this stage, Mr Willis had
already noted the condition of
the student, and had advised
him/her to not have any more.
If this is the case, I must call
into question the actions of the
bar staff, who are required, under
both Union regulations, and the
terms and conditions of the bar's
licence) to refuse to serve alco-
holic drinks to any person who
obviously under the influence of
alcohol. Breach of licence regula-
tions can lead to withdrawal of
the licence if a complaint is
made, and I am sure there is
cause for a complaint here.
Surely the Union should take
action to ensure that future
breaches of the rules do not lead
to external action being taken
against them.
Perhaps we should ask
whether College Security, who
feel that Mr Willis took all neces-
sary action in this incident, would
similarly absolve the Union Bar
staff of any blame for their part
in the incident.
I must also ask why the first-
year student involved was appar-
ently not considered by the
Union disciplinary to be guilty of
"failing to act responsibly", or
"bringing the Union into disre-
pute". Presumably the student is
old enough to be considered an
adult, and therefore to be respon-
sible for his/her own actions.
Why should Mr Willis, who
in my view may be guilty only of
a lack of foresight, take the blame
entirely for the actions of others,
possibly in breach of Union regu-
lations, and - more importantly -
the law?

Dear Felix,
At the first ICU Council
Meeting of the 1995/1996 acad-
emic year, our Deputy President
Clubs & Societies Tim Townend
said something like this -
"... any way we are a differ-
ent type of College (University)
for we have many foreign stu-
dents and none of them give a
shit about what happens to the
Union; they are just here to get
their degrees".
Being a foreigner I felt undig-
nified. I am Departmental
Representative & Treasurer of the
Ski Club. So how can he make
such accusations? I work hard
and do my best for all the stu-
dents I represent and know. So
how can someone in his position,
holding so much information and
power, say something of theis
kind? For his benefit I will point
out the Physics Department has
two representatives which are
foreigners and were the only ones
to stand for the post.
So I guess we give a "shit" to
what happens to the Union. We
also attend all council meetings. I
myself also attend the A C C
meetings. Therefore I hope he
will formally apologize to all the
foreign students in College that
care about what happens to the
Union?

M a r k Praise
Rachel,
We felt that we had to write
to you so that you could pass our
congratulations on to Mark for
last Friday night.
Not only were "My Life
Story" really good but the music
all night was outstanding. In fact
it was undoubtedly the most
enjoyable time we've had at the
Union in the last 3 years.
As a well known publication
would say "keep it up. Good
work fella"
Love,
Chris Ince et al

Dear Editor,
For a publication starved of
news other than that regarding
fire alarms and computer thefts
the Imperial College Ladies'
Rugby Football Club takes excep-
tion to the belittling of their feats
to obscurity behind "Features"
meriting Colin the Glassblower,
Anne the Archivist, countless
Ents plugs and hamfisted pages
with writers maze-like lines
replacing column inches. It seems
remarkable that a journal pro-
duced by students for students
has the gall to ignore worthy
effort by a group of such funded
by thesame source as the publica-
tion whilst devoting space to the
employees of College, the admin-
istration of which is frequently
expoused in the same editions.
I am most interested to hear
of the editorial decision taken to
publish not even an edited ver-
sion of the match report follow-
ing IC Virgins 60-0 victory over
UCL yet substantial space was
devoted to other teams'
mediocre results. Could it be that
your sports editor knows as little
about sport as he does about
Ents?
Catharine Byrne
Vice-Captain ICLRFC
I was decidely taken aback
by the sheer volume of sports
reports that suddenly appeared
last week: after a rather lacklus-
ter start to the term, we were
suddenly inundated with a pile
of fairly random scraps of paper.
It seemed fairest to give priority
to those reports which came in
first, rather than to discriminate
on the basis of the score. Do you
really think that you should be
preferred over clubs that pro-
duce 'mediocre' results just
because you do rather well?
Your article arrived after
everyone else's, and there was
already ample material for a full
page. But in the interests of har-
mony I sought out one of your
teammates in the bar that
evening to apologise for its omis-
sion: she told me that it didn't
matter at all. Apparently the rest
of the team didn't know what
you had written and weren't sure
they would be happy with it.
I was expecting to give your
article priority treatment this
week, but none was forthcom-
ing. Is this because Felix doesn't
merit your endeavours, or is it
because you lost?
I'm very sorry about the
deadline confusion, it clearly
wasn't helpful. It's difficult to
set a precise time after which it's
too late to submit, because obvi-
ously it depends on the volume
we've already had, but as a
guideline for the future, 8pm
Wednesday would be helpful.
I would happily set aside
more space each week for sport
if I had any guarantee that it
could be filled... I hope this
week's offering is more accurate:
I think everyone has been fitted
in.
I'm still looking for a per-
manent sports editor: would you
be interested?
