Portillo Visit Passes Peacefully
BY THE N E W S T E A M
On Wednesday Michael
Portillo, Conservative Defence
Minister, appeared as a guest of
Consoc. Launching himself into a
half hour speech with an anti-
Labour anecdote, he was on fight-
ing form.
Mr Portillo asserted that the
Conservative government is the
only one that has made (and will
keep) Britain competitive. He
gave the example of microchip
factories to illustrate how the
country must invest in business to
stay part of the global market.
Citing the Far East's positive atti-
tude to education he stated "we
have to re-establish the concept
that education is a privilege".
Through education the coun-
try would achieve intellectual
excellence and through this the
country would become more
competitive. He questioned the
"self depreciating" attitude of
many British citizens towards the
country itself and asked why peo-
ple who make money through
business are denigrated or
despised. His was the party
"unleashed against the politics of
envy".
Talking about the European
Community Mr Portillo stumbled
over the Maastricht Treaty. He
stated that Britain wants to be a
"high wage" economy, as it can't
compete on low wages, but also
justified the social chapter opt-
out stating that "social standards
can only be acquired when we can
afford them". This lies opposite
the "society of law, order ...
respect and care" he cited, at
another point in his speech.
Mr Portillo then took ques-
tions from the floor, which were
surprisingly unhostile. His only
sticky moment came when he was
unable to find a question from a
female student - eventually one
was raised by an older lady.
Mr Portillo did not speak on
what supposed to be his area of
expertise - defence - to the main
group, however later during a
short exclusive Felix interview he
did comment on the Bosnian situ-
ation. He defended the Tory
defence strategy, advocating a
NATO-centred solution. Reiter-
ating the views expressed in his
recent controversial speech made
at the Conservative conference,
he rejected the idea of a joint
European strategy. Whilst admit-
ting that the handling of the for-
mer Yugoslavian crisis hadn't
always been coherent, he insisted
that the Government's handling
of the situation had been right.
The campaign had been 'more
successful than was recognised,'
he said.
Despite rumours that his
appearance would be met with
jeers and rotten eggs, Mr Portillo's
visit, guarded by a heavy police
presence, passed off peacefully.
ICU Labour Club have
denied knowledge of flyers that
appeared around IC calling for
Portillo's speech to be picketed.
The "Stop Miguel Portaloo"
leaflets incorporated the Labour
Club emblem, but the society
insisted that the logo must have
been photocopied off their own
posters as a prank.
Jacob Tomkins, Honourary
President of the Labour Club
insisted that that they would
never advocate disruptive behav-
iour. "The more people that go
and see Michael Portillo the bet-
ter, because he's a great advert for
the Labour club," he said. "We
want to encourage people like him
to visit."
