album:sacred spirit*
This album has become something of a phe-
nomenon in Europe where it has sold over a mil-
lion copies so far. I thought to myself that surely
that many people can't be all wrong but my ini-
tial impressions were not good.
The album looked pretentious beyond belief
with all its spiritual messages and sleeve notes
which were so long and meaningless that only
someone with no more paint to watch drying
could even contemplate reading them.
However, if you get past the packaging and
actually get down to listening to it, you will - and
I jest not here - be very surprised indeed. Bearing
in mind that the tracks are supposed to be chants
of Native Americans in their natural homes, the
number of un-Native American instruments
used is quite astounding. The synthesisers and
guitars are useful for creating the music, but per-
sonally I've never seen or heard the chief of a
tribe presiding over a rain dance where there is a
band full of keyboards providing harmonies to
the chants.
The tides of the songs also make good read-
ing. For example, we have the
'Counterclockwise circle dance', and the
'Intertribal dance to stop the rain'. Future Sound
of London, eat your heart out.
The result of all this is that this is just anoth-
er Ecstasy of St. Theresa and FSOL-style record.
It's nothing new but it still makes fairly good lis-
tening if you're spaced out. If you can forget the
spiritual messages and pretend that this is an
album by a new band who just happen to use a
few chants here and there, then I'm sure you'll
like it, especially if you are into the aforemen-
tioned FSOL.
And it does have another use. If there is ever
a summer like the last one again, you oould put
the rain dance on and run around outside in the
faint hope that it would work. Or then again,
maybe not... (6)
gigisleeper + 60ft. dolls +
the wannadiesmr. 1 ^
The Wannadies kick off this Indolent Records
spectactular but unfortunately they turn out to
be very dull. They consist of three guys and an
extremely irritating girl who seems to add noth-
ing to their music. Not that their music is any-
thing to write home about. They just sound like
any of a host of late '80s indie bands who all
sound the same.
The 60ft. Dolls, on the other hand, we re
a very pleasant surprise. Their sound is a
mix of Oasis, Green Day and Offspring
while the variation of lead singers helps to
keep them visually interesting. One to
watch out for.
From the minute Sleeper hit the stage,
everyone in the Empire knows that it's
going to turn out to be something special.
Lead singer, Louise is a star. Her stage
presence has improved so much in the
past year that it is hard to believe that it's
the same person up there. The band
played all the hits from their album,
'Smart', while they even manage to play a
Pixies rip-off and make it sound great.
If you haven't seen them yet, don't miss out
next time.
albumisteely dan - alive in
americat, TOS c dick
Music didn't exist before 1977, that's obvious.
At least that's what I thought as a happily half-
dead, pummelled pre-pubescent in the midst of
a Buzzcocks orgy at the De Montfort Hall all
those years ago. And whilst I still beleive that
'70s disco has only been bettered in its awfulness
by the dross that pertains to be today's chart
music, I guess that we all mellow with age (if
you're mellow now then I'm glad that I never met
you when you were young - music ed.) and allow
a little melody to influence our lives.
For me it was juxtaposition of Coltrane's be-
bop mingled with the '80s genius of Blue Nile.
Now for those of you who know your musical
genres you will astute enough to have observed a
gap of some 30 years between the two. Enter
Steely Dan. Now everything fits. To attempt to
describe their music would be crass. Suffice to
say, anybody who is anybody has borrowed from
Messrs. Fagan and Becker.
Adulation over, this is a live album, beauti-
fully performed, especially the drop-dead gor-
geous, 'Third World Man'. And whilst its not the
best introduction to the band (noticeable
absences include Gaucho, Deaco Blue, Pretzel
Blue and Ricky don't lose that number), it is still
a must for anyone whose been bitten by the
Dan.
The album was recorded between '93 and
'94 in America. Typical - the '70s is back, they've
got the music while we've got the flares and the
tank tops. And wasn't it Donald Fagan himself
who, in 'Babylon Sisters', sang,
"Turn that jungle music down." Ahead of his
time or what? (8)
