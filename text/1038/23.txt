DIARY FELIX FRIDAY OCTOBER 2 7 T H 1 9 9 5 . TWENTY-THREE
Underwater Club
At the end of the summer term, twenty lucky
members of the underwater club embarked
on the annual summer tour. The usual
procession of vehicles comprising a
overloaded hire van and a new and
comfortable ICU minibus (now there's a
novelty), towing the RIB (a rigid hulled
inflatable boat), set off for Oban in Scotland.
After a day and a half of travelling via a
youth hostel in Wales and some very
precarious mountain "short cuts", we arrived
in Tralee Bay Caravan Site, our home for the
next eight days. Weather conditions couldn't
have been better, with temperatures reaching
30 degrees midweek, and glassy flat waters.
The first day was used to finish training
some of the experienced novices, and give the
new novices their first taste (literally) of open
water diving. Any remaining training could
now be mixed in with the recreational diving
of the rest of the week.

The "Week ol the Living Dead" continues
with a special creepy cocktail night - all your
favourite poisons and potions, plus Da
Vinci's own special Bloody Marys - be afraid.
And, due to popular demand, the return of
live Jazz in the Ents Lounge - see posters for

trip was the S.S. Breda, a WWII cargo ship
which sank in the shallow water of the bay.
This 420 ft long wreck has something to suit
every diver, whether novice or advanced,
with lots to be found for those who like to
rummage in the cargo holds.
In addition to the wrecks in the Sound of
Mull, the afternoons were often used for
relaxing scenic dives amongst the underwater
"kelp forests", or seal watching dives just off
Greag Island. Naturally curious, the resident
seals would follow the surface marker buoys
and occasionally buzz the divers below.
Needless to say there were some very happy
and wide-eyed divers who returned to surface
that day.
When not diving the RIB was put to good
use for water-skiing and the warm evenings
were spent on the beach having barbecues and
generally drinking too much.
The regular Albatross award, a broken
propellor on a neck chain, was passed to John
Moore for his boat handling escapades, which
also prompted the suggestion of renaming the
RIB "Rock magnet". Richard Goodwin and
Nicky Wheeler also received an award for
their efforts to deplete the local scallop
population.

Leave your musical taste at home as the Pop
Tart DJs return for the best and worst
excesses of the last 25 years, yes it's all
glitter balls and stack heels where we're
taking you. A total taste-free zone with all
the records you all love to hate, but you
know all the words to, from ABBA to Take
That, the Beatles to Wham. Forget it all for
one night with 'Shaft' - a sequined dream in
a world of grey. Â£1 to get in - or free if
you've got an Entscard, or if you dress the
part (70's, 80's gear or school uniforms
accepted)!
