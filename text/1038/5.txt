United Nations?
This week has seen the cele-
brations of half a century
since the establishment of the
United Nations. It has been
fifty years since the Allies won
the war and laid the founda-
tion stones in San Francisco of
what was called the United
Nations Organisation.
: today, the U N has expanded
beyond recognition - it has become
a giant consisting of a plethora of
agencies and their acronyms;
UNDP, UN HP. W1PO, UNC-
TAD, IMF, IAEA, WHO, FAO,
UNI ICR, I FAD, WFP... and the
list goes on. The U N agencies are
concerned with issues such as the
promotion of human rights, agri-
culture, health, patents, telecom-
munications, refugees,.and educa-
tion to name a few. Most: people
have the misconception that all the
UN does is peace keeping, and in
some cases even go to war.
The United: Nations Charter,
Article 1, reads as follows :
"The Purposes of the United
::
Nations .ire :
1. To maintain international
peace and security, and to that
end: to take effective collective
measures lor the prevention and
removal of threats to the peace,
and for the suppression of the acts
of aggression..."
I las the U N been able to do
this? Is there international peace?
It has been a couple of generations
since the charter was written, but
unfortunately the UN has not been
able to keep peace. There have
been countless wars since the char-
ter was signed in San Francisco: the
Korean war, Arab-Israeli wars, two
Gulf wars, the Falkland* war and
so on. Was Article I expressing
optimism or was it a sheer Utopian
statement ?: W e
all know that since
1945 there has not been a single
day of global peace. Even today
there are myriad wars being•-fought-
and from Bosnia: to Somalia, Sri
Lanka to: Afghanistan there arc-
sounds of children .screaming and
Kalashnikovs rattling. We can
unequivocally say that the UN is
notdoing its tob properly.
Article 55 of the U N Chatter
states that one of the principle
aims of the U N is to promote:
'higher living standards, full
employment and conditions of
economic and social progress- as
well as to find:solutions for 'inter-
national economic, social, health
related problems; and international
cultural and educational co-opera-
tion ' Indeed the U N and its
agencies have stnved to achieve the
above goals, but it is far from
achieving: them. There is mass
unemployment and civil strife, and
living standards in some parts of
the world leave much to be
desired.
The U N is crippled, bankrupt
and needs to be changed radically.
The answer lies in its own charter,
which states that the permanent
members of the Security: Council
(China, Russia, the United
Kingdom, France and the US)
should have veto powers with
regards to any decisions taken by
the General Assembly or any other
UN body. During: the Cold War
wc saw that this had a detrimental
effect on many proceedings
because the Soviet Union vetoed-
any proposal that affected its inter-
ests, and the US vetoed any actions
suggested by the Communist
Block. This rendered the U N a
dead donkey,: and its General
Assembly speeches consisted of
rhetoric and bright -ideas but no
actions, especially in matters of
peace keeping. Today, one of the
superpowers is gone and the UN
has become synonymous with the
US. All five permanent members
put their national: interests first,
thereby-eliminating the possibility
of any ground breaking reforms
The United States alone owes over
$1 billion m arrears, and the tight
fisted Republican Congress is not
willing to pay up because it is try-
ing to reduce its government bud-
get deficit.
The United Nations must
change to accommodate tor the
changing times, and it needs its
own powers to implement and
enforce peace. In order to do so
the U N charter has got to be
amended and the permanent five
must loosen their grip on the
Security Council. The Secretary
General needs to he delegated
more powers because what we see
••today is that Boutos Ghah relegat-
ed to the sidelines by the Secretary
General of NATO in the Bosnian
conflict. We need a U N that is gen-
uinely committed to achieving its
mandate.
As for Article 55, the United.
Nations needs to cut down its: lay-
ers of bureaucracy and to slim
down its agencies that overlap m
many areas. The UN should'1
be
used as an organ for transferring
knowledge, wealth and expertise
from richer to poorer countries,
thereby helping them to prosper.
Prosperous people will never go to
War, so it is in everyone's interests
to make the United Nations a suc-
cess.
