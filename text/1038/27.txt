Sub-Editorial
As Rachel has been busy graduat-
ing I have been given the dubious
honour of penning the editorial
and generally organising the Felix
office on Thursday. Thus any
mistakes can be attributed to me
this week!
Life, the Universe and
Graduating
The best thing about Com-
memoration day is, to my mind,
having two afternoons off in a
row. But to all those boys and
girls who've arrived back at IC
today with Mummy and Daddy
in tow (and even Great-Aunt
Ethel in one case) it is far more
significant than that. Apart from
those going into even higher
(Himalayan perhaps) education
it means the start of 'real work'
and the end of the 'best days of
your life'. Surely this needn't be
the case. I will think my life very
dull indeed if the best days of it
are spent at Imperial College.
Not that life at IC is boring, but
I hope that life beyond universi-
ty will hold more challenges to
overcome. (Read to the tune of
"Climb every mountain.")
It also strikes me as rather
strange that when you recieve
you coveted degree, in the pres-
ence of your peers, that you have
worked for at least three years to
obtain, you have to wear a -
frankly - silly dress! I speculate
that perhaps this is one final
intelligence test, after witnessing
two graduates-to-be attempting
to dofi their robes. Still, spending
three and a half hours in them
seems somewhat extreme.
Portillo Picture Competiton
In the last few days Felix has
been inundated by hundreds of
Michael Portillo pictures. Being
the humourus chaps we are some
of these pictures were altered in
an amusing fashon. This proved
to be so much fun that we've
decided to let everyone else join
in! Yes, the "Deface Micheal
Portillo's Photo Competition" is
open to all - just bring in you pic-
ture of MP, suitably altered (or is
that seasonally adjusted?). The
best entry recieved by Friday
next week will win - a free copy
of FelixV. (If it's really good you
might get a free pint.) Lawyers
please note - this is a joke and is
not intended to be detrimental
to the great man in any way.
Really.
And finally...
A big thank-you to everyone who
helped out this week, especially
on Thursday, and a big kiss to
'Inky' Andy for putting up with
everything this week.
