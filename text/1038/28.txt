IC MIXED: In the first match
of the season, Twinkletoes,
Trussell and Mighty Mo set the
early pace but overall IC's inter-
national mixed line up didn't
quite show the familiar killer
instinct that has made them
favourites ....um.... to go down!
However, following Cantona and
Ginola, another French superstar
was born. Dani Steer - a closed
season acquisition (undisclosed
fee) - made her debut and
showed great touch playing with
her partner (no comment). When
asked to reflect on the match
afterwards, Stevie T's reply,
"Where's the beer?" epitomised
the dedication and spirit of the
team!
IC LADIES: After obliterating
UCL last week 9-0/we narrowly
missed out this week against
King's. The result of 4-5 was dis-
2 - 1
2 - 0
1 -0
1 - 1
appointing because we should
have "whopped 'em" (- Margret)
Whoops-a-daisy!
football
IC H O M M E S IER: Un adver-
soire que nous connoissions, un
bon terrain: tout pour faire une
bonne performme. D'ailleurs,
tout commencait bien. Un pre-
mier but pour Mark avant que
n'ait la chance de toucher la bal-
lon, puis un deuxieme, 2-0 au
bout de 5 minutes. Dans l'e-
uphorie, on peche par impru-
dence et on se fait rerrouter puis
deposer en un quart d'heure: 3-2
pour l'UCL. Match jou, jou, jou!
On revient avant la mi-temps,
griece a IC: 4-3 pour nous. En
deuxieme mi-temps, toujours des
buts mois nous conservons (plus
ou moins) l'emprise sur la match.
Score final: 7-4. A noter que par
hesord, 1' envoye special a mar-
que un but.
IC W O M E N ' S ISTS: Despite
having 9 able players, we were
still able to show King's ICWFC's
new look. Our 'Norwegian
Demon' did her part towards the
victory with 6 goals. Our other
points came from 'Miss Racing
Reading' and the 'Greek
Crusader'. Our only problem lay
in the goal where the 'Canadian
Captain' bravely stood by and
watched as the opposition grace-
fully kicked the ball by.
Having won our first game,
we were not rewarded by show-
ers and beer, as we had to play
LSE instead of the seconds, who
were mostly still in bed nursing
hangovers. Though completely
exhausted from our first game,
we lost gracefully 3-2.
IC W O M E N ' S ISTS: We
arrived on the pitch to find our
opposition quivering, no doubt as
a consequence of Sunday's
pounding. In fact, to give them a
break, IC Ladies agreed to play
the entire game blindfolded. But
even with this handicap, Kings
were unable to stop every single
member of ICWFC from scoring
in the first half, including our
goalie, "Swiss Miss, the Birthday
Girl".
Our right mid/back cimbo
sped through King's defence,
scoring 3 goals. In the final
minute of the game, as IC
smirked around the pitch, Kings
accidentally put a goal past our
keeper, whose hands were tied to
give them a chance
netball
IC ISTS: Despite the severe
shortage of netball players this
Wednesday, IC succeed in field-
ing a strong team to face Kings
College in the BUSA tourna-
ment. Kings made a determined
start to the match, but we soon
regained our composure, ending
the first quarter Kings leading 6-
3.
In the second quarter IC
dominated play, at one time tak-
ing the lead with 11 goals to 10.
The match remained tense and
close throughout the next half
hour and the third quarter ended
at 19-17 to Kings. Unfortunately,
S P O R T
Kings shooting continued to be
fluent, particularly in the last
quarter where the match closed
at 27-21 to Kings.
Man of the Match: Maria
Glew.
snooker
Sunday Oct 15th saw this
year's Snooker Club Introductory
Open Tournament. The early
rounds witnessed established
team-players and well regarded
newcomers falling by the way-
side; both due to and despite the
recently introduced handicapping
system. The Freshers' champion
from the previous week, Ronald
Yip, was particularly unlucky in
going out after several well-
fought black-ball finishes going
against him in his second-round
match.
Making it to the final, Jon
soared into a rapid lead with an
astonishing display of break-
building skills, peaking with an
unbeaten 51 break, and followed
this frame with a tension packed
final-black win in the next to lead
2-0 with three to play.
A tightening up of his safety
game saw Alex claw his way back,
and with the help of a 40 break,
level the match. In the deciding
frame, Alex built strongly from
his 15 point start to slide the
game away from Jon and hold out
to claim his first I.C. tournament
win.
cross country and
athletics club
Last Saturday we took part
in the UCL relays with teams
participating from all over the
country. We has a good turn-out
and the Men's A team came 4th,
Men's B team came 14th and the
Women's team came 5th.
On Wednesday, the first
London Colleges League race
took place. Everyone ran really
well, and we should have made a
good start to the season. The next
race is on November 8th at
Richmond Park and anyone inter-
ested in running should get in
contact with a member of the
committee.
