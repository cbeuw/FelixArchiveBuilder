Why is Imperial so ugly?
Bland architecture makes Imperial an even more unpleasant place to be
Daniel Williams

H
ello Imperial, we need
to talk.
In previous volumes,
this journal has been
dedicated to burning issues of
the day: junior doctors’ working
conditions, the cost of living for
students, union bureaucracy, and
clarion call to vote (this 23rd
of
June). Nevertheless, there is an issue
fundamental to our very wellbeing
and self-esteem that never gets a
mention. This article aims to rectify
that.
"How fundamental could
something be?", you’re probably
thinking. Stop for a moment.
Look around you. Where are you
right now? What are you doing? If
you are like most FELIX readers,
I can hazard a guess. You are in a
building owned by the College. The
walls have an inoffensive colour,
all corners meet precisely and
orthogonally and the space is tidy.
You are on your way to something
important, wending your way
through the corridors and crowds
to your destination. It’s a short
while to go, so you’ve picked up this
newspaper and move on.You’re very
busy, you don’t have time to be on
campus, and even if you did, there
are nicer places to be.Herein lies the
issue: our campus is an unattractive
place to be.
Everywhere you go on campus,
buildings and walkways have been
optimised to increase traffic flow
and reduce inefficiencies in cross-
campus travel. Corridors have been
widened, time-consuming door
handles have been replaced with
bidirectional push-doors, or better
still, automatic doors with sensors,
allowing entry with no extra physical
exertion and no unnecessary contact
with surfaces. The spread of disease
has been reduced, queues for food
have been tamed,and room booking
has become more efficient through
centralised, computerised systems.
Our productivity should be shooting
through the roof. We should
be breezing through our work,
reaping the accumulated efficiency
dividends from the tireless efforts of
successive campus architects.
Undoubtedly, the achievements
listed above are significant. We
make daily use of these campus
facilities and services every time we
attend lectures,work in labs,send an
email or study here.Yet we must ask
ourselves: what do we enjoy about
being here? You’d probably say it’s
the people,or the buzz of innovation
here. You won’t rate the architecture
of our buildings highly. For many of
us, the austerity of glass, steel and
stone is too bleak and impersonal,
while the minimally-decorated
corridors, low ceilings and dated
office ambiance stifle creativity
and muffle character. Such an
environment is appropriate for an
insurance company headquarters,
but not an innovative,world-leading
institution of learning.
On every campus tour, the guide
will begin with a little bit of College
history: the Great Exhibition of
1851. Under the aegis of Prince
Albert, the best of the world’s
science and technology were
brought to London, which in turn
demonstrated Britain’s new ideas,
expertise and industrial skills. The
exhibition was a resounding success.
The proceeds were used to establish
four pre-eminent bodies of public
education: the Victoria & Albert
Museum, the Natural History
Museum, the Science Museum
and the Imperial Institute. After
more than a century of mergers
and transformations, the fourth
entity has become the College we
know today. Today very little of
the Imperial Institute remains, so
we can’t define ourselves in terms
of our architectural heritage. As
the custodians of Prince Albert’s
vision, how else can we show that
we continue to embrace the bold

For many
of us, the
austerity
of glass,
steel and
stone is too
bleak and
impersonal
and the new?
As mentioned previously,our built
environment appears to inculcate
homogeneity and sameness, rather
than vibrancy, self-realisation and
enjoyment of life. Our College
should be a hive of all sorts of
interactions, from cross-disciplinary
projects to friendly chats in the
corridor. We should feel joy when
coming to the campus, whether for
the first time or for the thousandth
time. We should want to stay on
after classes finish, to spend time
amid green walls, water features
and colourful walkways, not feel
alienated by gargantuan, monolithic
structures of glass,concrete and steel.
The onus is on us to achieve change.
Some problems are more easily fixed
than others; your campaign could
involve: signing FELIX’s petition
for library air-conditioning, talking
to your departmental representative
about building enhancements,
gardening on your building’s
balcony,yarnbombing poles,making
a beach on Dalby Court or seeking
street art commissions on footpaths
and walkways on campus.
Whatever the scale of your
contribution, your efforts won’t go
unnoticed.
