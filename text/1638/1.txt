Our sabbs will now be
paid £29,800 a year
• Their pay now matches the average Imperial
graduate's wage
• They will be the highest-paid sabbs in the UK
but may actually be worse off
T
his year’s change in sabb
pay, despite looking like
a £10,000 pay rise on
paper, may actually leave
sabbs worse off financially than ever.
In an investigation by FELIX,
comparing this year’s cohort
pay packet and remuneration
arrangements (i.e. offer of ‘free’halls
that goes with the job) to next year’s,
it was found that although our sabbs
will now be the highest paid in the
country, the offer of halls has been
revoked,meaning they will probably
take home less than this year’s after
paying rent.
As the pay packet currently
includes either a room in halls or
a rent contribution of 75% of the
average spend on the sabbs in halls,
plus £20,160,for next year’s sabbs to

take home as much as current sabbs
do, they’d have to spend just £110
per week on rent. Compare this
to the fact that sabbs this year are
getting as much as £210 per week
spent on their rent as part of their
remuneration, this year’s sabbs are
undoubtedly getting a better deal.
Our full investigation feature can be
read on page nine.
The decision was taken so sabbs
who choose to live in private
accommodation wouldn’t get a
worse deal than those who those
who choose to live in halls, as their
housing allowance is taxed and
worth much less than what those
in halls get. Controversially, this has
completely removed the incentive
for sabbs to live in halls. Up until
now the consensus has been that it
is beneficial for both them and the
students they live with for sabbatical
officers to live in halls,as it enhances
student experience.
This was all decided at a Trustee
Board meeting in January by
the then Managing Director, lay
trustees and several observers, with
no students representatives present
for the actual decision. The officer
trustees,including sabbs and current
student trustees could contribute to
the discussion but were asked to
leave the room when the decision
was made presumably to avoid any
potential conflicts of interest.
