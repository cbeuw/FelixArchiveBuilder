I
talked a lot about how much
the sabbs get paid this week,
and to think, it’s probably
never crossed your mind.
That’s fair – I don’t ask how much
you earn. Our feature on the
changes to sabb pay isn’t brand new
information,but this is the first time
any student, outside of the closed
doors of Trustee Board (literally
this time – they chucked out all the
sabbs when the decision got made)
will have seen a breakdown of the
difference in payment between this
year’s sabb team and next year’s.
And yes,I do think that’s important.
We fork out a lot of cash for sabbs,
and we want them to be good.
We want to pay them enough so
that they can eat, be housed, have
nice enough lives, and for it to be
interesting enough financially that
the job appeals to everyone. It’s the
same argument that gets brought
up when we discuss MPs’ pay. If we
paid them pittance then the role
would only attract the richest, who
were able to take a hit. The same, I
feel, goes for sabbs. If we dock the
benefits to such a point, it could
put the best, and not the wealthiest
people off. Finding an affordable

place to live is about the hardest
part of living and working in
London, and getting that as part of
the deal was certainly a big part of
my decision to take a year out of my
life and make a paper for you cuties.
People complain that becoming a
sabb is a cool job to slip into if you
haven’t found a real job yet. I think
if you’re rich and haven’t found a job
yet, becoming a sabb is now a lot
easier. If you hate students so much
that you don’t want to live in halls,
you probably shouldn’t be a sabb.
I think this change is a shame,
because it looks like we’ve given
sabbs a wacking great pay rise,when
potentially,this new deal means that
a home isn’t part of the job. It’s like
being a vicar. Fucking hell, being
a vicar (I assume) is hard. People
confessing weird intimate details
about their lives to you and not in
a cool down-the-pub way, having
to go to church all the time, plus
you don’t even get Christmas off.
But you do get to live in a vicarage.
Well Beit is my vicarage, you are all
my parishioners and the journalistic
integrity is my Jesus.
Does it matter what we pay them
as long as they do the job well? I

know I’ll have done my job well,
when I go into the 568 one day, and
one of the bar staff (and not one of
the ones who knows me already)
goes: “Hey, it’s Grace!” and then
everyone at the bar cheers, and then
the barman makes my usual (they
know my order already, because
everybody does) and slides it down
the bar to me (there aren’t those
mats on the bar in this fantasy) and
I catch it and swig it,before winking
at the camera.That’s when I’ll know
I’ve earnt my £19,000.
