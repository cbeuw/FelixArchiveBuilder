here are some of us
puttering around campus
that remember a time
before smartphones and
constantly available internet. Even
before sharing just the one computer
in the corner of the living room
with your entire family, waiting
painstakingly for the whirling ring
of the AOL dialup to finish, only to
be kicked off again five minutes later
when someone 'needed' the phone.
When connecting with people
involved – wait for it – walking over
to their house and knocking over
the door.
Since the revolution of the
internet, technology and computing
devices have rapidly evolved into
smaller, more powerful, and more
complex tools – many of which are
being generated and created here
on our campus. But I’m not entirely
sure we appreciate it. And to be fair,
who can blame generations that
simply have always known a life in
which the entire world is accessible
in their hands? There’s just no
context.
So here’s some context – I
recently saw an old black and white
photograph taken in New York. It
was 1956, and there were four men
in overalls laboriously pushing a five
MB IBM server up a wooden ramp
into a truck, with a crowd of people
curiously watching. The server was
easily half a cubic meter – for just
the five MB, which is nothing
compared to the capacity of say, a
new Apple iPhone 6 at 64 GB. It’s
just basically just a large photo on
your tablet.
After furiously scribbling some
numbers on paper, I realised that
an iPhone 6 would require 12,800
of these machines to reach the
same capacity. At an average pace
of a ten minute kilometer, it would
take me about six and a half hours
to walk around the entire capacity
of an iPhone in 1956. So in a mere
60 years, we have compressed
technology by at least six hours
(that’s not really a scientific fact,
don’t quote me).
Considering the amazing leaps in
technological advancement, maybe
we should place our appreciation of
it contextually – be more cognizant
of the awe-inspiring capacity we
carry around with us every day,
and think carefully about what we
actually use it for.

t the end of last month
we witnessed the death
of a lowland gorilla
in Cincinnati Zoo.
Harambe, who was put down
during an attempt to rescue a four-
year-old boy who had fallen into
the enclosure. A week later and
we’re still talking about the incident,
debating who’s to blame. However,
instead of playing the blame game,
perhaps we should be talking about
the role of zoos in the 21st
century.
Animal collections have existed
for thousands of years, yet the
modern zoo is a 19th
century
invention, aiming to educate and
inspire the public. However the
biodiversity onslaught we started
noticing in the 20th
century, made
Is there room for zoos in 2016?

the need for conservation apparent
and in 1933 the World Association
of Zoos and Aquariums produced
its first conservation strategy.
Today, conservation is not only
a key element of the aims and
objectives of most zoos, but also a
key justification for keeping animals
in captivity.
So what are the implications
for zoos as institutions, when an
invaluable member of a critically
endangered species is put down?
“It's really galvanised public support
for questioning the purpose of
these institutions,” say Elisa Allen,
Associate Director at the People for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals
(PETA), UK. “What is this
intelligent self aware animal doing
in captivity for our entertainment?”
Many questions arise when
considering the inner workings of
zoos. How much of a zoo’s budget
is allocated to scientific research,
for example? The San Diego Zoo,
the largest in the world, only spent
7.6% of its income on research and
conservation in 2014. The London
Zoological Society (ZSL) on the
other hand spends approximately
20% of its income on research and
conservation, as is illustrated by
its 2014 annual report. Yet in both
cases, most of these funds come
from external grants. Of the £34.4
million that is generated by its
animal collections, £31.1 million
is pumped back into the ZSL's
collections, to simply maintain
them.
That wouldn’t be a problem if
the collections contained mainly
endangered species. But in reality
they don’t. Less than a third of
mammals within the London Zoo
are endangered. The same goes for
amphibians, with some species not
even having been assessed yet.
“Ultimately we have to look at the
root of the species declining and that
always comes back to their habitats
being destroyed. Zoos would be far
better off spending their money and
resources in protecting these wild
populations” concludes Allen.
However, things are not that

There
are really
intricate
factors
behind the
scenes
that people
don’t
understand
simple, as is pointed out by
Rosi Stoycheva, a conservation
biologist who has worked on many
conservation projects across the
country over the past five years.
“First many endangered species
are in areas that are very remote.
There are permits you need to get to
remove these animals from the wild.
You must consider if the animal will
survive in the zoo environment and
how many you can harvest from the
wild to create a breeding population”
says Stoycheva.
Indeed, the intricacies of
endangered species’ conservation
are illustrated through numerous
examples of failed conservation
attempts such as the extinction
of the Sumatran Rhino from the
Malaysian Peninsula when the five
remaining captive individuals all
died within 18 days from disease.
Other times, obstacles can be
bureaucratic, with many well known
as well as rumoured reintroductions
being delayed due to governments
getting cold feet.
“These are the issues that no one
really thinks about. There are really
intricate factors behind the scenes
that people don’t understand and
this is where a lot of the criticism
stems from.”
Zoos might not be perfect, but
they are an important conservation
tool nonetheless.“You shouldn’t rely
on just one measure to solve your
problems,” concludes Stoycheva.
“Without zoos there wouldn’t be as
many species."

oral bleaching has
severely impacted the
Great Barrier Reef
over the past month.
The corals, which are in constant
competition with algae for light
and nutrients, seem to be losing the
battle, with many bleached coral
skeletons completely engulfed in
algae. Pictures and testimonials
from Lizard Island have been
painting a grim picture of ghastly,
brown, decomposing coral. WWF
Australia shared pictures taken last
month of granite Island ‘ground
zero’ where a mass bleaching event
killed an estimated 22% of the reef’s
coral.
The Great Barrier Reef is
currently undergoing its worst
bleaching in recorded history.
Approximately 93% of the reefs
along the 2,300 kilometre site have
suffered bleaching. Coral bleaching
occurs when water temperatures
increase causing coral to expel their
symbiotic algae which in turn result
in their white-grey colour shift.

t Sh!t Sc!ence, we want
to show that every
science paper is a drop
of water that, in its small
way, helps fill up the aquarium
of human knowledge, so that us
little humans can float around
happily oxygenated by the water of
cognition. This week, you may have
guessed, we are talking about fish.
Have you ever had one of those
annoying friends with an aquarium
who will swear that their fish
recognises them? ‘Look how he
presses up against the glass! He
knows his mommy!’ they’ll say.
Well I have,and it took everything
in my power to contain the powerful
urge to roll my eyes so far back
into my skull that they might not
find their way back to the front of
my head. But actually, science has
recently proven that they might
have a point.

University of Oxford, was published

Lonely fishkeepers vidicated: fish can tell when you’re being a dick
in Scientific Reports this week.
Scientists presented a tropical fish
with pictures of human faces, and
asked the fish to react to the pictures.
These fish, archerfish (Toxotes
chatareus), are known to hunt aerial
prey by projecting water at high
speed to knock them out, so it was
easier for the scientists to train the
fish to learn to hate one face, and
spit in its direction whenever they
was presented to it.
Surprisingly, the fish were capable
of recognising one face out of 44
different pictures. This worked even
if features such as hair and face
shape were removed, showing that
fish can, indeed, recognise the finer
traits of a face.
Now, of course, the results of
this study go further than simply
vindicating the legions of crazy fish
owners. It’s about how we recognise
faces as humans.
Face recognition is paramount
for humans to establish proper
social skills. This skill was
long thought to be reserved
to humans, as the capacity to
discriminate faces was found to
be hosted in the fusiform gyrus,
located in the neocortex of the
human brain. Facial recognition
had previously been identified
in non-human mammals,
such as dogs, sheep and cows,
but it could be argued that
those animals had evolved to
recognise faces as a consequence
of domestication.
The premise of this article
was to investigate whether an
animal which had no reason to
have evolved to know human
faces, such as a fish from a
tropical area, could learn to do
so, even when those animals
lack a neocortex. These results
show that facial recognition is
not a human trait, and do not
require a brain the size of a
human’s.
