Making all science open access by 2020
T
he EU Competitiveness
Council, a committee
including research,
science, and industry
ministers from all member
countries, announced last week that
scientific publications should all be
open access by 2020. We all wish
for this to happen, but is the idea
utopian?
There are many hurdles to
overcome. Firstly, there are no legal
bindings. According to the council
itself,it is only a“political orientation
for the 28 governments”. Secondly,
four years is a very short period
for such a dramatic change in the
publication process, especially when
encountering strong resistance from
the private publishing industry
whose interests are at stake. Thirdly,
the actual details to achieve this goal
have yet to be announced.
FELIX contacted private
scientific publishing groups but they
all declined to comment about the
EU report. Through a spokesperson
from the International Association
of Scientific,Technical and Medical
Publishers (STM), they announced
“it is vital that embargo periods
(when articles are only available
through paid subscriptions) be set
at a sustainable level to enable the
subscription model to continue
to support the operation of high
quality journals”.
Researchers disagree, especially
when it comes to matters of
public importance. According to
Professor Stephen Curry, a biologist
here at Imperial and open access
advocate, the slow release of articles
is actually harmful. “There was
a recent initiative to encourage
people working on the Zika virus
research to release their initial data
and their results very quickly even
in advance of publication. But we
still haven’t moved to such a system
for antimicrobial resistance, HIV
infection and malaria, and that in
itself have cost lives”.
Another counter-argument is
the financial burden. “The upfront
costs for an immediate transition
will need to be covered. These costs
will currently fall disproportionally
on research-intensive countries that
produce more research relative to
the rest of the world,” claims the
STM.
However, it might be a fallacious
argument. “I think you have to
recognize that most of this research
is publicly funded and all the money
that goes to pay for subscriptions
at the minute is largely publicly
funded as well,” commented Prof.
Curry. “Because most of the work
is publicly funded it has to be made
open access by right, and I think
there is enough money in the system
to fund that. It is just a manner of
moving the accounts around”.
It is already unlikely that universal
open access will be achieved by
2020, but through incremental
steps in governmental policies
and consensus we may slowly start
to separate access to scientific
information from corporate profits
although that requires patience.
The Amazon river is one of
the most biodiverse fresh water
ecosystems on the planet.The many
fish species that call its water home
though are shrouded in mystery.
A new study analysing otoliths,
the stone like bones located in fish
ears, might help us understand the
migratory routes of many species.
The research might potentially
redefine our knowledge on many
fish species especially in the cases
of fish which are economically
valued and which regularly travel
through the borders of multiple
nations, such knowledge can be
invaluable, informing management
policies. The chemical composition
of otoliths can reveal whether the
fish has lived in 'black' or 'white'
water, as well as what the salinity of
its habitat was.

Can we control disease using
computers? Researchers at
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology suggest yes, having
integrated digital and analogue
computations into cellular DNA.
Disease acts as an input to initiate
module expression which turns gene
segments on or off,converting input
into an output,hence converting,say
chemical concentrations to a simple
0 or 1 signal. This biological circuit
has potential to cause the body to
initiate one of say three output
responses, in accordance to, for
example, blood glucose levels, thus
acting as a diabetes control. Other
potential uses include treatments for
cancer, bowel disease, and probiotic
bacteria development to treat gut
disease, with clinical trails for the
latter beginning in twelve months.

Solving the
mammal puzzle
Microbial
nanowires
Our ancient mammalian lineage
may be older than we initially
thought. Scientists investigating
prehistoric mammalian teeth
collections, have significantly added
to our understanding of when our
fury relatives really advanced in
the wake of their distant reptilian
relatives, the dinosaurs. The
commonly accepted view is that
dinosaurs, the main competitors of
the mammalian clade constrained
mammal ecological expansion.
The University of Southampton
has turned this view on its head,
putting two and two together; that
is, with a diverse tooth collection,
comes a diverse animal group.
Our mammalian lineage may have
already diversified extensively before
the K-T mass extinction event some
66 million years ago.

Take a geobacter bacterial cell, its
pili, and attach each to a graphite
electrode, and wham! You have
an electrical current. That’s right,
Mother Nature has produced
organic, electrically conductive
hair-like filaments which give the
geobacter a little spark. Aromatic
amino acids in the pili of the
geobacter transport electrons at a
voltage comparable to that of copper
wire. Proteins are usually electrically
insulating, but geobacter pili are
counter-intuitively conductive.
Scientists at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, Holy
cross, and Brookhaven National
laboratory found that the way the
small molecules are arranged, at a
distance of 0.3 nanometres, gives
the pili their copper like electrical
conductivity.

How will a Brexit scenario impact science?
FELIX asks the scientists on each side of the fence so you don't have to
B
rexit may have finally
overtaken myriad
memes of Donald
Trump’s hairpiece on our
newsfeeds. For months, the EU
referendum has loomed large in a
collective public mind, bamboozled
by potential impacts on everything
from human rights to house prices.
It is a political hot potato that when
dropped on the 23rd
June, could
see us out on our ear in the cold,
looking in through the window at
the EU planning their Christmas
party, wondering whether we have
done the right thing.
But above the cacophony of
multiple debates, what of Britain’s
unassailable drivers of modern
progress – science, healthcare,
research? Enter Martin McKee,
Professor of European Public
Health at the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine
and Professor Angus Dalgleish,
Foundation Chair of Oncology at
St Georges University and Senior
Advisor to the pro-leave lobby
group ‘Scientists for Britain’, who
have real problems agreeing.
As a champion of international
health care, McKee’s extensive
travel around the world engaging
researchers and policy makers in
neglected health issues has led
The Lancet to comment that “even
conversing with him is liable to
cause jetlag”. I am inclined to agree
as I conduct our conversation over
email during his stopover between
Mexico and Miami.
“Would the world class status of
our institutions falter without the
backing of the EU? Yes”, he says.
And the biggest threat to research?
“The difficulties we would face in
engaging with European networks,
[…], the difficulty with exchanges
of staff, exclusion from EU science
advisory committees, […], we
should also not ignore the inevitable
cut to science funding”.
McKee is right – the EU has
brought us undeniable rewards. UK
universities are huge beneficiaries
of its research grants – (Imperial
received £48.8m in funding in 2014),
200,000 UK students and 20,000
UK staff have been able to work or
study in Europe under the Erasmus
scheme, our NHS is part-staffed
by skilled non-British EU workers
and cross-country clinical trials for
rare diseases have been coordinated
where small disease population sizes
are a real issue. But it is far from
perfect, with problems many and
manifest and questions about anti-
democratic behaviour lingering.
While this needs to be considered,
in leaving, McKee argues, there is a
real risk that we would continue to
contribute to the EU from outside
while relinquishing our place at the
negotiation table.
Dalgleish, on the other hand,
holds less complimentary views of
the EU, labelling it a “sclerotic”,
“dying organisation” that is heading
for a “headlong crash into a
wall”. He regards the views of the
remain campaign as “unnecessary
scaremongering” and feels Britain
will continue to thrive, regardless of
the “completely and utterly doomed
EU”.

in light of recent trade discussions
and TTIP proposal between the US
and the EU – “It’s black and white
[…] either you have the EU or you
have the NHS but you can’t have
both”.
A report published this week by
Lord Darzi,Director of the Institute
of Global Health Innovation at
Imperial College and the London
School of Economics, addresses
some of these concerns, and it is
well worth reading. Amongst other
suggestions, it claims that both the
EU and member states will be able
to agree TTIP reservation clauses
for national health services, helping
secure against privatisation. “The
core principle of the NHS”, the
report comments, “will continue
to be defined by UK government
whether we remain in, or leave, the
EU”.
“I find it inexplicable that even
a handful of scientists in the UK
can support Brexit”, say McKee,
“initially I just assumed [it] was a
lack of awareness of the issues, their
misconceptions, such as those on
the Clinical Trials Regulation, have
now been pointed out numerous
times yet they persist in repeating
them. It must now be clear that
they simply make up 'facts' to fit
their arguments, with a complete
disregard for the truth. Sadly, you
have to fact check everything they

say. Even where there is a grain of
truth it is hardly never the whole
truth, and almost always years out
of date”.
And so the clock ticks and we
edge further towards the deadline.
As an unprecedented event, can
our predictions about what will
happen to science, research and the
NHS be anything more than noisy
rhetoric amidst largely speculative
debate? That said, hilarious as they
are, memes of Donald Trump’s
hair should remind us of how close
a nation could come to making
a decision with far reaching
ramifications.
“We are taking a leap in the
dark”, says McKee, “I’m sure we
could salvage something [should we
leave], but it will clearly be much
worse than what we have already”.
I find it
inexplicable
that even a
handful of
scientists in
the UK can
support
Brexit
“There will be hardly any
difference at all in the practical
day to day science [we experience
in Britain]” he says, asserting that
our position on the world stage
is secured – “Britain is far bigger
than the EU in science”. He is
more concerned by the impact of
remaining on our NHS, particularly
