A food journey in Notting Hill
FELIX explores the secret eats in this charming neighbourhood
A
smuchasIregretmoving
to somewhere in the
middle of Holland Park
and Shepherd’s Bush for
second year,living in close proximity
to the beautiful neighborhood of
Notting Hill definitely made up
for the daily power walk sessions
to catch the Circle line to college.
Here are a few of my favourite
places I return to ever so often and
never get tired of. Every place is
conveniently a few minutes’walk off
Portobello Road, the main road that
stretches all the way from Notting
Hill Gate tube station right up past
the A40 Westway. Trust me, there’s
much more to Notting Hill than the
movies and a few cracked pots at the
antiques market.
Lisboa Patisserie
Let’s start from the north. This
section looks a bit run down but
don’t judge by appearance – this is
exactly where the most authentic
Pastel de Natas, or Portuguese
custard tarts, in London live. Lisboa
Patisserie sits on the far end of
Golborne Road, east of Portobello
Road. Expect a bright red awning
and a sign in black, old-school font
at the door.
On weekend mornings you’d
find her buzzing with Portuguese
locals forming a short queue at the
entrance. Old couples sit outside
on metal tables and chairs, sipping
their coffee and munching on
platefuls of golden pastries. People
come and leave with boxes of treats
for takeaway. Upon entry you’d
be greeted by a long, nose-height
glass counter absolutely stacked
full of all sorts of traditional buns,
cakes and pastries. And that warm,
buttery, heavenly smell of freshly
baked goods drifting from the ovens
hidden behind.
This is when the pressure starts.
You have approximately one minute
to make up your mind before the
servers dressed in red polo shirts
demands for your order. Don’t
worry if you don’t know the name
of that gorgeous looking cream bun.
It’s okay to point.
Pastel de Nata. How can I
describe them? A palm-sized, crispy
yet slight chewy pastry tart filled
with a wobbly, velvety-smooth,
sweet egg custard with black
splotches on the top. Each bite is
bliss. Other favourites are bolo de
arroz (rice cupcakes) and bolo de
coco (coconut cake). Did I mention
how unbelievably wallet-friendly
this bakery is, even with such good,
authentic food in 2016? A Pastel de
Nata is just £1.15 and other pastries
range from 95p to £1.30. There is a
minimum card payment of £5 but
I’m sure it’s hard to not leave with
an overflowing box.
Snaps + Rye
A few steps back towards
Portobello Road is a modern
Scandinavian café by the name
Snaps + Rye. Its bright, simplistic
interior with white walls, wooden
floors and stylish chairs totally
embraces the Danish concept of
hygge (pronounced as hoo-ga) –
meaning to live comfortably and
happily.
Breakfast and brunch is served
every morning with items including
a hearty buttermilk oat porridge,
freshly baked Danish pastries
and skyr, an Icelandic yoghurt.
Their all-day menu is comprised
of light salads and healthy bites
using seasonal, locally sourced
ingredients, ranging from £5 to £9.
Something that must not be missed
is their delicious and photogenic
selection of Smørrebrød, which are
essentially open sandwiches on a
piece of buttered dark rye bread.My
favourite would go to their house-
cured Gravalax Smørrebrød (£2.50)
– slices of Nordic style, sweet cured
salmon garnished with black pepper,
radishes and dill.
Fabrique Bakery
Walking down south past the
Westway is the newcomer to the
neighbourhood – Fabrique Bakery.
Originated from Stockholm, this
artisanal bakery also has branches
in Hoxton and Covent Garden,
serving the best Swedish cinnamon
buns (£2.50) in London.
Step in to find a small cosy space
with white tiles and industrial style
lighting. Trays of freshly baked
cinnamon buns, vanilla buns and
cardamom buns (all £2.50) are
casually stacked in a tempting pile
next to the counter. The rustic
looking shelves and baskets are
stocked with sourdough loaves
available in white and dark rye.
Their cinnamon buns with a
glass of hot chocolate is the perfect
formula for a Sunday afternoon
pick-me-up – or fika as they say
in Sweden. These small pillows
of joy are deliciously moist and
chewy, with a slightly crispy exterior
generously smothered with caramel.
The flavours from the sweet and
warm spices circulate your mouth
generating a sense of peace and
happiness. No exaggeration.
Granger & Co.
Head further southeast to the
pristine Westborne Grove. Those
who know me or have read my
review a few months back would
understand my absolute loyalty
and love for this Aussie style all-
day eatery – everything from the
chairs to the animal print coffee to
of course, the stack of warm, golden,
fluffy ricotta hotcakes, complete
with a freshly peeled banana, a
melting knob of honeycomb butter
and soaked in maple syrup (£12).
Heaven.
If the ricotta hotcakes are too
heavy for you,do try their scrambled
eggs (£8.20). They are truly one-of-
a-kind – pale yellow and cream-like,
garnished with a single spinach
leave and served with two slices of
buttered sourdough toast. For the
health-conscious, you will never be
short of supply of green smoothies,
acai bowls, porridge and chia seed
pots.
Their lunch and dinner menus are
full of unique creations: courgette
fritters (£11.50), kimchi fried rice
with soft shell crab (£14.50), a
drop-dead gorgeous fried chicken
sandwich (£9.50).
