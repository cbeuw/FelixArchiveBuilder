This week on Games of Thrones
watchful eye of the scary nun,trying
to talk her out of the cult. Margery
slips her a note to let her know
that she has her head on straight
and hasn’t been brainwashed and
sends Olenna back to Highgarden.
Before she leaves, she still has time
to completely tear into Cersei. I’m
going to miss the lack of given fucks
Olenna brings to King’s Landing.
Popping back to the Riverlands,
Jaime and Bronn arrive at Riverrun
to take over the siege from the
disorganised Frey’s. Bronn has a
good couple lines reminding us why
he became a fan favourite after such
a long absence. The Frey’s threaten
the Blackfish that they’ll kill
A
big reveal this episode,
hope you’re ready to
board the hype train.
We’re dropped into an
unfamiliar, oddly idyllic sequence of
some happy villagers building some
kind of chapel. This being Game
of Thrones, I was half-expecting a
dragon to come and burn everyone
to a crisp just for being too happy
with their lives. Not allowed in
Westeros. Then we get the episode’s
biggest moment; the Hound is back!
Turns out he’d been lying in a pool
of his own blood for a couple of days
before this lovely Septon came to
nurse him back to health. He claims
hate is what kept him going but the
Septon doesn’t quite believe him.
See what he would have thought if
Sandor told him the story of how he
got those scars (No Joker reference
intended). Nevertheless, the Septon
asserts that the gods (whichever
gods they may be) still have a plan
for him.
We head back to Margaery in
Jesus Camp where she and the
High Sparrow have a Bible-off
before he cuts to the chase and lets
her know that she really needs to
bang her teenage husband and get
preggers, claiming “Congress does
not require desire on the woman’s
part, only patience”. Someone must
have been talking to my ex. Olenna
has a chat with Marge under the
Smug-face Margery is back. Photo Credit: HBO
Edmure if he refuses to hand over
the castle but fail to follow through
with this. Jaime uses his powers of
the golden pimp-hand to put them
in their place and requests a talk
with the Blackfish. The parley is a
great scene with two of the snarkier
characters in the show facing off.
This basically ends up with the
Blackfish sticking up a middle
finger at Jaime and asking what the
fuck he’s gonna do about it.
Throughout the episode we get
several scenes of Jon and Sansa
travelling all over the North trying
to curry favour with different
parties. First up, the Wildlings: Jon
gets their support with the help of
his hypeman, Tormund and a giant
saying his name. Then he goes to
possibly the most badass little girl in
the show (Yeah, that includes Arya)
in Lyanna Mormont; she rips the
shit out of everyone in front of her
before offering her army of 62 men
after Davos convinces her. Shame
he got into smuggling instead of
being a lawyer, he would’ve been
great. Last up are the Glover’s
who basically say “Look, we’ve
had enough of your shit; you’re
not getting more of our men to
die.” Sansa looks like she may be
useful for a second before getting
demolished. Jon and her argue for a
bit whether they’re ready to march
on Winterfell and she sneaks off
to write a letter. It’s pretty hard to
read but I’m pretty sure she’s asking
Littlefinger for assistance from the
Knights of the Vale. That guy must
be getting sick of going up to down
the entire continent for this girl.
We get a short scene of Theon and
his sister arguing at some brothel
about how he’s become such a
pussy ever since losing his peen.
She gets him to drink a mug of ale
and he appears re-energised and
committed. See, kids? Alcoholism
works!
Across the Narrow Sea to Braavos,
Arya manages to book a ride back
home before getting stabbed 37
times in the chest.Yeah,the Faceless
men weren’t exactly cool with her
lack of follow-through apparently.
She doesn’t seem to be getting any
help either so I have no idea what’s
happening with her now.
The episode wraps up with the
Hound’s lovely new friends getting
threatened and subsequently
murdered by the Brotherhood
without Banners. I told you that
you aren’t allowed to be happy in
Westeros. Expect a rampage of
revenge from him next week.
This was, all in all, a pretty dull
episode.There was a lot of setting up
characters to be in places for further
events but nothing happening in the
meantime – probably setting up for
an explosive final few episodes of the
season. The title, ‘The Broken Man’,
obviously refers mostly to Sandor
but equally to Theon, possibly even
Jon who gets very frustrated with
his lack of success.
Game of Thrones is available on Sky
Atlantic, Sky Go, and HBO GO.
I’ll miss
the lack of
given fucks
Olenna

to King’s
Landing Look,
we’ve had
enough of
your shit;
you’re not
getting
more of our
men
It’s season six, episode seven
