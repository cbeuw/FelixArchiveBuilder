Mech Eng head tells students he’s voting remain
Professor Peter Crawley emailed all mech eng students and staff telling them life
would be harder after Brexit
O
n Sunday, the head
of the department of
mechanical engineering
sent an email to all of
his students and staff, addressing
concerns about a post-Brexit fee
status for EU students, and telling
them that he was “strongly in favour
of remaining in the EU” and so
would be “voting accordingly”.
In the email, Professor Crawley
said that several EU students had
expressed concern that if Britain
were to vote to leave the EU in this
month’s referendum, they would be
forced to start paying international
fees of £26,000 a year, as opposed to
the £9000 they currently pay.
As with everything in the
referendum, it is unclear how the
free movement of people, which
currently allows students from the
EU to pay home student fees,would
be affected.

T
he City and Guilds
union offered a novel
way of recovering from
exam stress relief last
week – playing with dogs.
The dogs, who were brought in by
the dog re-homing charity All Dogs
Matter,sat in a room in CGCU,and
students filed in all afternoon to
play with them.They also had a few
walks around campus.
This is the second time the CGCU
have offered puppy therapy to its
members, and it’s proved incredibly
popular, with 300 sign-ups in 24
hours for this session, and all the
places being booked up last time
they ran the event as well.There was
Dog therapy for stressed
students
As Crawley stated in his email,
it is unlikely that these students
would be retroactively deemed
international, and be forced to start
paying £26,000 halfway through
their degrees.However,he reassured
EU students college wouldn’t just
start charging them more without
a fight, saying “we will do all in
our legal power to ensure that
current students are not subject to a
dramatic increase in fees”.
If Britain were to leave, fewer EU
students are likely to come to British
universities,and those that do would
probably have to pay the higher fees.
This would mean there would be no
financial cost to Imperial in terms
of fee income, as it will either take
more home students for the same
money or take more international
students and make more cash.
Professor Crawley made no secret
of how we will be voting in the
referendum. He said a leave vote
would spell bad news for funding
research, the companies that mech
eng works with, enlisting students
from the EU, and that therefore he
would be voting “accordingly”.
He told FELIX that remain
offered “ease of collaboration
around Europe, including student
exchanges” which “is hugely
important for the College”.
“We also benefit from being able
to recruit research and academic
staff from EU countries without
work permit issues. We succeed
by being open, and anything that
increases barriers is detrimental.
I am also concerned that many of
the companies with whom we work
will scale back their UK activities
and relocate to the continent to be
within the single market. It is much
easier to work with companies when
they are located closer to us.”
This comes after Alice Gast,
the Imperial President, sent an
email out to all students and staff
saying how college could not tell
its students how to vote, but that
Imperial had been involved with the
remain campaign.
Staff in the RSM took a different
view, forwarding an email out to all
students and staff from Imperial’s
Britain Stronger in Europe
campaign group, but adding they
were happy to send an email out
from the equivalent pro-Brexit
group.
In the email,
he said that
several EU
students had
expressed
concern
some queuing on the day, with some
students from other departments
getting turned away . Millie Tsang,
the CGCU welfare officer said that
having to turn people away was sad.
“Originally I was met with heavy
doubts from within the CGCU and
IC Union, who said it would not be
approved and would also raise loads
of trouble. Thankfully, I talked to
College anyway,” she told FELIX.
Despite recently introducing a no
dogs on campus rule, permission
was granted, with some limitations
about who could access the dogs
and the room.
Students sat in a waiting room
before getting their ten minutes with
the dogs, and in this time, students
from different courses could mingle
and chat to Millie about any welfare
issues they were having.
One student arrived at the event
despite having a fear of dogs. In
their feedback, they told CGCU: “I
really think it is a great idea against
stress and fear; the latter is also quite
common and I’m sure it could help
more students than just me”.
Thanks to donations from
students, CGCU also managed to
raise several hundred pounds for the
charity providing the dogs.
This form of therapy is a firm
favourite at the LSE and Harvard.
