Next year our sabbs become the highest
paid in the country
But they may actually be worse off than this year’s group, and here’s why
N
ext year’s sabbs, who
were elected in March
and take up their roles
officially this August,
will, on paper, become the best-
paid full-time sabbatical officers in
the country. They’ll have jumped
from fourteenth highest-paid sabbs
to the highest, beating last year’s
highest, LSE, who pay a modest
£26,582 a year. Technically, these
officer trustee roles are getting a
£10,000 pay rise in the space of
one year (from £19,500 this year to
£29,800).It sounds like a lot,but it’s
only slightly higher than the 2013
figures for the average Imperial
grad’s starting salary (£29,200). If
you look at what the current sabbs
get in terms of a remuneration
package, next year’s cohort may
actually be getting a worse deal.
Our calculations
Let’s assume that this will be the
first job next year’s sabbs will be
getting paid for this tax year (we’ve
assumed that they’re on the tax code
1100L, if you’re really interested).
We’ve assumed that they are all
home students who took out student
loans after 2012 and have finished
their degrees, and so will now be
paying back some of that loan every
month. We’re also assuming they’re
not paying into the pension scheme.
This is all a little different for the
FELIX editor, who is employed for
eleven and a half months, rather
than a year and a half like the
full-time officer trustees are (your
DPWs and Union Presidents, for
example).
Their pay will now be £29,800,
and our calculations with the above
tax code and assumptions using
thesalarychecker.co.uk say that sabbs
will now be taking home £22,600.
Similar calculations on this
year’s salary (pre-2012 student
loan repayments and the same tax
code) assume that take-home pay
is currently £16,200. Yes, obviously
twenty-two grand is way more than
sixteen, but that’s not the end of the
story.
Remuneration package
The current remuneration package
(i.e. extra stuff sabbs get ‘paid’ but
not in cash) includes a place in
halls. They do not have to pay rent;
it’s paid directly from the union’s
coffers to the college’s. And these
aren’t the shitty cheap twin rooms in
the basement of Parsons. These can
be nice single ensuites in Eastside
or Beit if the sabbs choose them
(which several have).
Currently, if they don’t want
to live in halls, they can have a
docked amount of cash to live in
halls (typically 75% of what would
have been their halls budget, as an
incentive to live in halls).
At least two sabbs this year have
lived in Beit, so if we take the
standard 16/17 rents for an en suite
room (£220 per week) and take into
account the 54 weeks that they are
employed, they will need to pay
£11,880 worth of rent. Taken off
their £22,600 take home pay, sabbs
choosing to live in Beit would now
only get £10,800,whereas sabbs now
take home £16,200 after tax. This
obviously means most sabbs will
choose to rent privately, and escape
the astronomical cost of Imperial’s
own accommodation, unless you
wanted to live in the un-renovated
side of Evelyn Gardens.
To put it another way, for next
year’s sabbs to have the same amount
of take-home cash as this year’s,
they will have to spend just £6400
on rent, which amounts to £120 a
week, for the 54 weeks they’re paid.
It’s certainly doable, but you’re not
going to be in South Kensington for
that kind of money.
So why this change?
This year’s sabbs (the Sandon-
Allum-Kaye-Howitt-Watson-
Chun-Yin-San year) were paid
£19,500 per year straight-up, and
then given either halls for ‘free’,
i.e. as part of their remuneration
package, or 75% of the average
amount getting spent on putting up
sabbs in halls. This cash for private
rent was paid to the sabbs directly,
so was taxed, meaning they got a
significant hit if they chose to live
out of halls.
Many people saw this as a good
thing, as having sabbs living in halls
is arguably a benefit to freshers
– everyone on the DPFS’ floor
knows what the union is – but the
incentive for living in halls has now
been completely removed, and from
the figures above you can see you’d
be a mug to do it.
During the Trustee Board
meeting in January at which the
change was decided, no sabbs were
actually present. They were allowed
to contribute to the discussion,
but asked to leave whilst the
actual decision was made. The
minutes of the meeting show that
the current sabbs said that “the
financial compensation was not a
major consideration when putting
themselves forward for the role”,
but it could put future generations
of students, who don’t have saving
or family money, off.
Does anyone care how much
sabbs get paid, as long as they’re
doing a good job? Well, we know
that Imperial has some of the best
graduate prospects in the country,
so get the best people who aren’t
all from the same economic
background,it’s fair to make the pay,
and all that comes with that, at least
semi-competitive.
