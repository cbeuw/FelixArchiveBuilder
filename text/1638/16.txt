Is David Hockney all he's cracked up to be?
S
oon, London art galleries
will be in the throes of a
David Hockney takeover.
Starting from July,the Royal
Academywillshowcase ‘82portraits
and one still life’, and beginning in
February next year, the Tate will
host a comprehensive retrospective
spanningdecadesoftheartist’swork.
It should come as no surprise that
the capital’s major art institutions
are falling over themselves to get a
slice of the Hockney pie; for most
of his 50 plus year long career he
has been an imminently popular
artist, far outstripping his Brit Pop
contemporaries from the Royal
College of Art in the race for public
recognition.
His popularity has come as
somewhat of a double edged sword.
He's beloved by the public, he's very prolific, but do his paintings stand up to scrutiny?

Arts Editor
His mass appeal has proved to have
an inverse correlation with the
regard in which critics hold him.
At his best, Hockney’s work
fizzes with energy, and seems to
have something important to say.
In one of earliest paintings, We Two
Boys Clinging Together, named for
the Walt Whitman poem, reveal
his homosexuality, showing two
figures intertwined, other paintings
code his attraction towards Cliff
Richards. Hockney moved to Los
Angeles in 1966 and adopted a style
of painting that would define the
rest of his career.
In the 1967 painting, A Bigger
Splash, Hockney conjures up a
vision of Los Angeles that is
haunting. Bright, flat colours fill
neat. clinically geometric shapes.
Oppressive Californian heat, rises
from the red brick paving around
the pool and permeates the painting.
The hard lines are disturbed only
by a scribble of white in the centre
of the canvas. The viewer is left to
imagine the identity of the unseen
diver who has left the splash in
their wake. American Collectors is
another painting that is perfectly
evocative of that particular Los
Angeles glamour. Two figures, Fred
and Marcia Weisman, she in a pink
robe, he in a funereal black suit
stand stiffly amongst their modern
art acquisitions. Their poses are stiff,
as if they were cardboard cut-outs.

the brightness is disquieting, An
atmosphere of money,boredom,and
disillusionment is palpable.
If Hockney’s semi-naïve style suits
the Los Angeles paintings perfectly,
it is not so effective in his other
works. In the series A Bigger View,
exhibited in 2012 at the Royal
Academy, he trades the West Coast
sunshine for the more temperate
climes of his native Yorkshire.
Bright ceruleans are exchanged for
bright viridians and huge canvases
tacked together depict vistas of
rolling hills outlined in navy blue,
intersected by unspooling lilac
ribbons of country paths.The bright,
bold, and flat colours, so effective
in portraying Los Angeles become
saccharine sweet in their depiction
of Yorkshire.
These landscapes are pure
escapism, showing a nostalgic,
idyllic view of the English
countryside, unravaged by any
signs of modernity. The choice of
colours and the brushstrokes make
it clear that Hockney's style is not
a response to the landscape but an
inflexible filter like tool he applies
to whatever he sees before him.
The compositions are pretty, but
comfortable, entirely safe. They
would not look out of place on
a chocolate box or an illustrated
edition of The Hobbit as pictures of
Tolkein’s The Shire.
The most interesting of the bunch
is May Blossom on the Roman Road,
in which huge hawthorne bushes
come alive with blossom that looks
like writhing maggots desperate to
be free of the green foliage. Here,
there is an hint of menace that lends
interest. That the landscapes are so
uninspiring are a shame because
Hockney's paintings of Eccleshill,
again in Yorkshire in the 1950s
are evocative and filled with loose,
seemingly effortless brushwork. By
comparison, his later work seems
contrived.
In A Bigger View, Hockney seems
unable to move on from the past,
both from his own prior work and
that of artists he admires. Anything
more than a cursory glance of
Early Blossom, Woldgate reveals his
inspirations, the bright colours, the
brushwork seem lifted wholesale
from Van Gogh, but hold none of
the frenetic emotional depth of Van
Gogh's own work.

Van Gogh is a frequent source of
inspiration in Hockney’s work, the
pen and ink linework in Mother,
Bradford (1978) is heavily influenced
by Van Gogh’s early work. Van
Gogh is far from the only influence;
the Paper Pool series is reminiscent
of Matisse’s Cut-Outs. The graphic
splash in A Large Diver (Paper Pool
27) harkens back to the burst of
light that appear in Matisse’s Icarus
(1946).
These are

Hockney is
never able
to step out
of Picasso's
shadow
Hockney
is an artist
who has for
decades
shown a
knack for
connecting
with the
public
Hockney has spoken at length
about his love affair with Pablo
Picasso's work.It has shaped a great
deal of his output, in particular the
'joiners' series which encompassed
his output in the 1980s. In these
works, such as Pearblossom Highway
Hockney manipulates polaroids and
photographs into cubist collages. In
doing so however, he is never able
to step out of Picasso's shadow to
say something new. The images
feel gimmicky and pastiche-like.
A quick search of the Hockney
tag on Instagram reveals a host of
users sharing their holiday pictures,
pictures of desks in the 'joiner' style.
In many instances only the content
of the photographs, the hipster mug
or finished geography homework
give away that Hockney could not
have created them: never a sign of a
robust artistic movement.
Hockneyhashadanextraordinarily
prolific career,moving from medium
to medium throughout his 50 year
career. His latest project involved
iPad drawings, most notbaly of the
Yosemite National Park.
If there was any proof needed that
Hockney's work is overrated beyond
parody in recent years, the response
to these iPad drawings are it.
We've all heard the old addage
that a two-year-old could draw
that; often it is employed unjustly,
a two-year-old would not produce
a Jackson Pollock painting, and
fine, neither would they produce a
Hockney if let loose on the drawing
app, but a twelve-year-old might.
It's not the use of the iPad that's
objectionable, digital paintings
are very often accomplished and
gloriously beautiful, but Hockney's
are anything but. These are
conventional landscapes executed
poorly, and what's worse exhibited
with a seriousness that defies belief.
These paintings are testament to the
decline of an once interesting artist.
The new show at the Royal
Academy is mercifully not filled
with iPad drawings but a series
of acrylic portraits of Hockney's
friends and family.
The sitters appear against the the
same background of a mid blue,
and turquoise, all seated in the
same chair. Hockney considers the
dozens of portraits one cohesive
work, and it's clear how the
background has been kept minimal
and the same throughout to shift
the attention onto the sitters. For
me, the background staying the
same does almost the opposite, the
sitters take the role of the props,
akin to light changing across a wall.
This is a shame, Hockney's portraits
of his mother painted throughout
his career are emotional, deeply
personal paintings that reveal
Hockney's true skill at portraiture,
by contrast the new paintings are
closer to illustrations.
Hockney is a prolific artist who
has for many years demonstrated
a knack for connecting with the
public. That is no mean feat, and
nothing to sniffed at, but it has
become and more apparent that as
an artist he has little new to say.
It's interesting to speculate how
his work would've developed had
he not to moved to Los Angeles
at the beginning of his career,
or had continued to explore his
sexuality in his work, even in his
paintings of swimming pools, the
most evocative are of his then lover,
Peter Schlesinger. These criticisms
have been levelled at Hockney
over decades, which he brushes
off with ease. His productivity far
from declining over recent years,
has increased. This is to be admired,
he clearly creates work that many
people enjoy, and that in itself is
something to be celebrated. All
the same, the retrospective at the
Tate will probably be more worth
checking out than the exhibition of
new work at the Royal Academy.
