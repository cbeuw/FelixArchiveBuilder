Imperial physicist who contributed to Higgs
boson discovery dies at 83
Sir Tom Kibble was head of the Imperial physics department from 1983 to 1991
P
rofessor Tom Kibble,
who was a member of
the Imperial physics
department for 32 years,
has passed away at the age of 83.
He was born in Chennai,
India, in 1932 but went to
school in Edinburgh, and got
his undergraduate and PhD at
Edinburgh University, before
joining Imperial as a NATO fellow
in 1959.
Whilst at Imperial, but before
he was even made Professor of
Theoretical Physics,he wrote a paper
in 1964 entitled Global conservation
laws and massless particles with two
American scientists from Rochester
University, New York, which is
widely regarded to have led the way
for the discovery of the Higgs boson
by Sir Peter Higgs and François
Englert fifty years later, who won

...have already taken place,with all
positions but the DPFS role having
been filled (DPFS manifestos can
be found on page fifteen). The pay
rise and change of remuneration
package was advertised in the 2016
Election Guide, so all candidates
ran knowing about the new deal.
A union representative told
FELIX: “ The Board of Trustees
regularly review all aspects of
remuneration for Officer Trustees
and staff. In January the Board took
the view that living in halls no longer
represented part of the Officer
Trustee role and as such opted to
remove the previous penalty for
living out of halls. Officer Trustees
and full-time Officers are now paid
a set point on the College’s pay scale
and can opt to pay to live in halls
should they wish.”.

a Nobel prize for Physics after the
find.
This 1964 paper is beautifully
written, and in 1967 he published
another paper on his own, that
contributed further to the theory.
Later, in 2010, Sir Tom was among
several scientists, including Peter
Higgs, who worked on the theory
leading to Higgs boson to be
awarded the J. J. Sakurai Prize for
Theoretical Particle Physics.
In 2014,Tom Kibble was knighted
after the Higgs boson’s existence was
proved during huge experiments at
CERN in 2012. Imperial physicist,
Professor Virdee, who was knighted
with him after overseeing the CMS
experiment at CERN, said at the
time: “I was hoping Tom would be
recognised. I'm very, very happy for
him, and I'm sure we'll have a glass
of champagne when next we meet”.
When Higgs and Englert were
awarded the Nobel prize, they
were surprised that Kibble was not
also named in the honours, as the
rules permit three scientists can be
named. At the time, Higgs said:
“Not only did [Kibble] publish the
last of the papers in 1964, he also
wrote a longer paper that was really
very important in generalising the
sort of thing I had written in '64'”.

O
n Monday, college
support staff, including
the security team,
were given brand new
uniforms, which for the security
staff meant cumbersome new ties,
epaulettes, long-sleeved shirts with
the Imperial logo and suit jackets
with name badges.
Whereas before, the security
staff were free to wear collared
white shirts of any sleeve length,
depending on the weather, they now
must wear long-sleeved branded
shirts with their suits at all times.
This week, temperatures hit highs
of 26°C, making the new outfits
particularly impractical.
Imperial’s security department
website says its top priority is to
“the protection of College students,
staff and visitors from harm through
physical assault, fire or smoke
inhalation”, which are activities
which arguably need security
officers who can move across
campus quickly.
Although many will be familiar
with the security staff members who
have an office in Beit, you will often
see them patrolling the campus.
Security guards partly act as a
deterrent to crime – the fact that
the new uniforms look impractical
to the point where the wearers don’t
look like security guards,could mean
that they aren’t such a deterrent.
Their new purple ties and
epaulettes, which sit on the
shoulders of the shirts, are bright
purple, reminiscent of Imperial
‘mauviene’, a dye accidentally
discovered in the 1800s by one
William Perkin from the Royal
College of Chemistry, which also
adorns Imperial graduation gowns.
EU debate takes place at Imperial
Referendum fever is yet to take hold
L
ast Thursday, The Big
EU Debate took over
Skempton building with
members of both the
leave and remain campaign battling
it out over the key battlegrounds
of the economy, immigration and
democracy as a whole.
Speaking for the remain
campaign were Mary Honeyball
(Labour MEP for London) and
Amelia Womack (Deputy Leader
of The Green Party and ex-Imperial
graduate) and for leave were Tom
Hunt (a Conservative councillor)
and Michael Gold (a Green Party
MP candidate).
Skempton lecture theatre 164
was the political battleground for
the clash of the titans with Deputy
President (Welfare), Jennie Watson,

morning.
Similar to a political wedding,
the audience almost split exactly
into two halves, one pro-Brexit and
one pro-remain, except there was
more heckling than your average
Eastenders wedding.
Opening statements from both
sides touched on the key issues

as “policy is deemed as British if it is
doing well, and European if it isn't”.
He just lost the French Open so
take from that what you will.
As the debate continued,
the classic cases were made on
both sides, with Michael Gold
proclaiming that “Operation Fear
has come to Imperial College” but
he may have just been referring to
exam season.
Questions from the audience
followed the debate, although many
preferred just to shout them out
as will during the proceedings –
clearly these people haven’t watched
enough Question Time.
After the rather heated exchanges
for the best part of 90 minutes, a
bar tab was placed behind the old
Union bar in order to encourage
students to engage in discussion
with the panellists and their peers
over drinks.
So, was the complex socio-
politico-economic debate that has
divided a country settled once and
for all in an Imperial lecture theatre
on a Thursday night? Not quite, but
the bar tab in the union helped.
The full debate is available to
watch on the Imperial College
Union Facebook page.
Student caught in housing scam

Security get new more formal
uniforms
A
student was caught out
by scammers this week
after paying a deposit on
a flat that turned out not
to be for rent.
The student saw the flat,which was
just off the King’s Road, advertised
on one of the union’s fresher
Facebook groups. After speaking
with the person who posted the
ad, the student paid them a £450
“holding fee”, which he believed
was to confirm his interest before
the landlord made the trip down
from Liverpool to show the student
the property.
After making the bank transfer,
however, the landlord cancelled
the viewing several times at the last
minute, before finally not turning
up at all. After the landlord stopped
replying to any calls or emails, the
student quickly gathered that it had
been a scam.
The student has now been told
by both the police’s Action Fraud
centre for cybercrime reporting
and Natwest (where the fraudulent
account was opened) that they are
unlikely to get the cash back. After
making a complaint with the bank,
he was told that Natwest told the
student that they aren’t responsible
and so can take no action.
At least one another Imperial
student has fallen victim to a similar
scam over the last few months.
The same address was also
advertised on Facebook pages
related to Queen Mary’s university.
It’s important to remember to not
transfer any money until a contract
has been signed. Contracts can be
checked over by the Student Hub.
