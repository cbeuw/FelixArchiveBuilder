W
hile it is hard
enough to make a
straight-forward
genre film, it is
much more difficult for a director to
attempt to send that genre up: make
it too broad, and it descends into
an unamusing mess; too narrow,
and it becomes a smug attempt
to show off the creator’s smarts.
With this in mind, you would be
forgiven for having a shudder of
apprehension before seeing The Nice
Guys, the latest work from director
and writer Shane Black, which
attempts to skewer neo-noir films,
buddy comedies, and the 1970s
simultaneously. But Black manages
to pull it off,supported by the strong
cast, to make The Nice Guys a light,
buoyant piece of entertainment.
To say that The Nice Guys is in on
the joke of the genre tropes would
be a massive understatement. The
film sets out its mission statement
in its opening: a young boy sneaks
into his parents room to steal his
father’s Playboy lookalike only to
be interrupted when a car crashes
off one of the iconic ridges of the
San Fernando Valley, directly into
his home. Upon examination of the
crash, the kid finds adult film actor
Misty Mountains (Murielle Telio)
naked, bloodstained, and writing on
rock, offering up the beguiling last
words "How do you like my car, big
boy?" It’s an indicator of the time
(late 1970s) and place (Downtown
L.A.) so immediate the opening
titles are redundant.
This scene, with its sexual
objectification dripping in casual
violence, sets the tone for the
duration of the two-hour-long film,
which takes several cues from Paul
Thomas Anderson’s superlative
1997 work Boogie Nights, another
film set around the porn industry of
1970s LA.Those taking the scene at
face value would be rightly offended,
but soon it becomes clear just how
much of a parody The Nice Guys is,
and how everyone – the director,the
cast, the audience – are in on the
joke. The crash scene is followed by
another collision, this time between
the two principles: Holland March
(Ryan Gosling), the down-and-out
alcoholic PI who litters his rented
apartment with scotch bottles
following his wife’s death; and
Jackson Healy (Russell Crowe), an

Neo-noir shadows and Californian sun
The Nice Guys is a send-up of genre flicks that's in on the joke
enforcer heavy who just wants to
feel useful. March has been hired
to investigate the reappearance of
Misty, seen by her myopic aunt, and
ties it in with the disappearance of
Amelia Kutner (Margaret Qualley);
Healy, meanwhile, has been hired
by Kutner to try and keep her
whereabouts unknown. The result is
Healy turning up at March’s door,
and breaking his arm, almost in
front of his 13-year-old daughter
Holly (Angourie Rice).
In the real world, that would be
the end of it (and at some point the
police would get involved – they
never really seem to do so; perhaps
the LAPD’s funding was cut that
year),but because we are in neo-noir
world, a different set of rules apply.
After Healy is assaulted in his office
by two gun-toting goons looking
for Kutner, he teams up with March
to try and track her down before
she is killed. What follows is a
classic screwball-style buddy movie:
Healy’s seasoned professionalism
clashes with March’s uncontrollable
alcoholism – while the former cases
a joint looking for witnesses, the
latter just tries to find out where
the free bar is. Healy is disgusted
by March’s readiness to exploit
his needy clients, but is perfectly
willing to kill those in his way, a fact
pointed out by Holly, who is the
moral centre of the piece.
Crowe gets his teeth stuck into
his role, bringing a sense of defeated
nobility to Healy, a man blown
along by the vice-filled wind of L.A.
He plays Healy completely straight,
taking cues from the serious noirs
of the 1940s and 50s. Gosling,
in contrast, was clearly having a
complete ball during the filming,
and his infectious comedic energy
colours every scene he is in. After a
run of heavy, serious films, Gosling
is showing us that he still retains the
comedy chops on show in Crazy,
Stupid, Love and Lars and the Real
Girl. An effective comparison may
be drawn with Nicolas Winding
Refn’s 2011 thriller Drive, another
L.A.-based neo-noir centred around
a nostalgic time period (while set in
the present, Refn’s film is heavily
laced with 80s overtones); while
Gosling was near-mute in Drive,
communicating only through body
language,in The Nice Guys he attacks
thedialogueatfullthrottle,chucking
out smart quips like a circus knife-
thrower. He also skewers Crowe’s
over-the-top dialogue, which is
pure neo-noir ham: all dramatic
metaphors and grizzly anecdotes.At
one point, Healy makes reference to
a character "dropping off his radar",
and March openly scoffs the use of
such a po-faced term, revealing the
ludicrous nature of the predictable
dialogue often found in a neo-noir.
The Nice Guys would work solidly
as a straight neo-noir piece, one
that is enjoyable but ultimately
forgettable. However, it is the way
in which Black has approached the
project, with his tongue firmly in
cheek throughout, threading the
scenes with a heavy skein of irony,
that elevates this above standard
fare. There are certain elements that
feel uneven – particularly the way
Black seems to be taking inspiration
from every decade between the
40s and the 80s – and a number of
fight scenes could be cut: they were
clearly supposed to be dramatic
centrepieces, however, where the
film shines is the dialogue, and
these parts only seem to bloat the
film. But look past these, focusing
on the chemistry between Gosling
and Crowe, and the razor-sharp
screenplay, and The Nice Guys is
a rough gem of a film, shining
through the L.A. smog.
Documentary corner: Portrait of Jason
Fred Fyles
Film Editor
A
long with bumblebees
and pandas, another
species that is seemingly
on the verge of
extinction is the raconteur. The
word, which reached its height of
popularity in the mid-20th
century,
is used to describe a teller of tales:
someone who can take an amusing
singular anecdote, and spin it into
a tale of gold, causing you to hang
onto every word. Today, the closest
thing the Western world has to
a true raconteur is director John
Waters, aka 'The Pope of Trash'.
This raconteur spirit is what makes
Shirley Clarke’s 1967 documentary
Portrait of Jason such a compelling
watch.
Portrait of Jason, as the name
would suggest, centres around
Jason Holliday, a black, gay, aspiring
cabaret performer. Over the course
of 12 hours, Clarke and her team
ask him questions about his life; his
answers are vague, laced through
with theatrical accounts of his early
years as a hustler on the streets
of New York City. As the night
progresses, Clarke and her team
become more and more hostile
towards Holliday, abusing him with
racial slurs, in an attempt to get
underneath the exaggerated persona
he has adopted. The 12 hours of
footage are cut down to a much
more manageable 105 minutes,
with scenes floating in and out,
cut together in a haze that gives an
inebriated quality to the film.
A pioneer of the cinema verite
movement, as well as a key player
in the experimental film scene of
the mid-20st
century, Portrait of
Jason may be Clarke’s masterpiece.
Weaving together fact and fiction,
she exploits the authenticity of
the documentary format – which
promises a ‘truth’, if such a thing
can ever be achieved on film – by
filling it with the ramblings of a
man for whom authenticity is a
quick route to an early grave, a
man who has had to learn to adapt
and hide in order to stay safe. At
the same time, Clarke is playing a
dangerous game, tiptoeing towards
the ethical code of professional
documentarians, and smashing it
to pieces. The scenes where her
and her partner berate Jason are
some of the most uncomfortable
things I have witnessed in a
documentary, producing a palpable
sense of unease. Clarke seems to
be upending the conventions of
the direct cinema movement; by
both provoking her subject and
manipulatively editing together
the rushes she took over the twelve
hours, she subverts the traditional
role of the documentarian (derived
from documentum, the latin word
for ‘proof’, hinting at its structural
importance in the concept of truth-
telling), who is supposed to use the
camera as a mechanical, all-seeing,
all-consuming eye.
Portrait of Jason not only shows the
true power of a raconteur – a power
that can get one out of trouble just
as often as it gets one in it – but
Clarke also highlights the force
and weaknesses of the documentary
genre as a whole. Her and Jason
leave no question unanswered, no
story unsaid.

F
or an anti-establishment
radical, Ken Loach cuts
an unlikely figure. A
polite man approaching
80, whose latest work, I, Daniel
Blake, won the Palme d’Or at this
year’s Cannes, Loach is one of the
world's most feted directors, but his
inoffensive appearance belies the
raw power contained in his films.
Over the last five decades,Loach has
been directing films in a raw, realist
style, which revolve around issues of
social and political justice. As well
as this year’s Palme – his second
– 2016 sees the release of Versus:
The Life and Films of Ken Loach, a
documentary charting his ups and
downs. In the film world, such a
work is equivalent to a retrospective
– a crowning achievement capping
off an illustrious career.
One of the key themes in both
Loach’s oeuvre and the film is
capital versus labour. Coming
from a working-class, Northern
background, Loach managed to
attain a place at grammar school,
and then went on to Oxford,
where he was pushed up against
the children of the establishment,
whose privilege manifested itself
as a sense of entitlement. Loach
began his creative career at an
auspicious time, when the BBC was
expanding its operations, setting
up their Wednesday Play series, for
which Loach directed ten films,
including the lauded Cathy Come
Home (1966), an unflinching look at
homelessness and its impact on the
family structure which led to people
for years afterwards trying to give
money to lead actor Carol White in
the street, convinced she really was
destitute.
The current climate in British
culture cannot be ignored,and while
the documentary does point out
that Loach came out of ‘retirement’
shortly after the most recent
election, much of the criticism of
the current system must be inferred.
The fact that the majority of the
actors, screenwriters, and directors
who serve as talking heads in the
film are working class strikes a
contrast to the typical cross-section
of this generation of artists – think
of Tom Hiddleston, Benedict
Cumberbatch, et al. This lack of
working class mobility, combined
with the current wholesale attack
on the BBC, makes one think that
Loach is most definitely a product
of his time, and would be unlikely
to make it today.
The other main antagonism
explored is art versus commerce:
Loach’s refusal to waver from his
political beliefs led to a number
of his films being banned, and a
period in the 1980s (the most fertile
time for protest, anger, and dissent)
where he didn’t have the money to
work at all.In order to make a living,
he directed adverts for – among
others – Nestlé and McDonald’s,
something that still weighs heavy
on his conscience. Interviews with
his family help to break down the
image we have of Loach as a po-
faced crusader, with his children
betraying his love of glossy musicals,
which one daughter puts down to a
desire for escapism. Well, when the
subject matter you’re working with
typically revolves around injustice,
brutality, and anger, a little bit of
MGM glamour is excusable.
The film ends on a triumphant
note, with Loach’s resurgence in
popularity, following his first Palme
d’Or win in 2006 for Irish Civil
War film The Wind that Shakes the
Barley. Director Louise Osmond
suggests that Loach may be more
well regarded in continental Europe
than the UK, a claim that has
weight when we consider the home
reaction to The Wind that Shakes
the Barley, which saw critic Simon
Heffer compare Loach to Hitler,
despite not having seen the film.
While the film was completed just
before his most recent win, it makes
an independent case for valuing
Loach – one of this country’s most
vibrant, steadfast, and engaging
filmmakers.
