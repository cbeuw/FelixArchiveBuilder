CANCER
VIRGO
This week, you’re the sex
survey results. You’re gunna
come, you’re gunna come,
you’re nearly, yep, that’s it,
gunna, nearly, ooh, oh, oh,
actually you’ll come next
week.

This week, you’re one of the
ugly buildings complained
about in this week’s FELIX.
Typical, people judging you
on your looks before even
bothering to get to know you.
When will your reflection
show who you are inside?
This week, you’re the plastic
cow that advertises the
farmers’ market. When the
Queen’s Tower bells chime
incessantly, you can moo
freely, calling to your lost
herd who will never respond.
This week you decide you're
a floating voter in the EU
referendum.Floating voter in
the sense that you just want
the UK to float the fuck off
to somewhere with better
weather.
This week, you’re caught
taking cocaine in the
bathrooms at the union.
Seriously? Like, why? The
only thing that could make
568 any worse would be extra
awake to witness it.
This week you're Noel
Edmonds and you take to
Twitter to endorse a magic
box which "tackles cancer".
The incessant Deal or No
Deal may have got to you –
not every box is special, Noel.
This week, you’re college, and
decide to divest from tobacco
and invest in students instead
by giving each one a fiver.
They all rush to the union
shop on Sherfield to buy a
packet of cigs with their new-
found riches,but you’ve taken
those away too. Bastards.
This week, work is taking it’s
toll, due to Jupiter ascending.
Time to take some time out
to relax, meditate and do
some mindfulness. Either a
man in a red coat, a post box,
or a London bus could mean
trouble for you, so be careful.
This week, you’re one of
the statues on the RSM
building, and the only people
who notice you are Spanish
tourists; students don’t give
you a second look. It was you
who attached the answers to
the back of the Geophysics
exam.
This week, you decide to
become a sabb, but discover
the whole job is a lie. Those
screens at the union where
you wave at passers-by aren’t
actually screens – you have to
stand in those boxes all day
and night maniacally waving
until everyone goes home
and you can be free.
This week you're Imperial
security and are forced to
wear your snazzy new suit
jackets whenever you're
outside. You see a thief
fleeing 568 but he gets away
as you spend too much time
making sure your uniform's
correct before pursuing. Ah
well, at least your epaulettes
look good.
This week, you go to the
EU panel discussion, but
accidentally sit on the wrong
side of the room. The heady
atmosphere surrounding the
Brexit side – the distinct
scents of both Lynx Africa
and mild xenophobia – pulls
you in, and you inadvertently
leave as a fully fledged
member of UKIP.
