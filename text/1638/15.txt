C
athy Rentzenbrink
begins her story with a
night out. On a summer’s
day twenty-six years ago,
she had decided to head home first,
bored, while her brother remained
behind in the bar hoping to “get
lucky”.
“Matty never, in any sense of
the word, ‘got lucky’ again,” she
continued, as she recounted how
her brother was hit by a car on his
way back, and the suffering of their
family that followed. She described,
in poignant, heart-wrenching
words, how her brother Matty fell
into a persistent vegetative state
and how the family eventually, after
eight years, came to the painful
decision to perform “the last act of
love” – withdrawing nutrition and
life support for their beloved son
and brother.
This incredibly personal and
moving journey is told in Ms
Rentsenbrink’s memoir The Last Act
of Love, one of the shortlisted books
for the Wellcome Book Prize. It's
is an annual award given to a work

about the role literature can play in
medicine, and vice versa. Listening
to Ms Rentzenbrink speak in person
about her book and experiences
highlighted the role words have in
healing and coming to terms with
difficult decisions of life and death
in medicine. Indeed, the Wellcome
Book Prize is a beautiful idea, a
yearly reminder that words help
us understand the complexities of
illness and healing, and bring us
closer to what it means to be human.
Themes that have come up in past
prizes include birth and beginnings,
pain and loss, memory and identity.
Since the prize began in 2009, it
has celebrated books about struggles
with mental illness, difficult
decisions in the course of medicine,
passion projects delving deep into a
particular medical issue or another,
and even thrillers that explore
memory loss and identity. This
year, the winner was It’s All in Your
Head – an insight into the world
of psychosomatic illnesses, written
by consultant neurologist Suzanne
O’Sullivan. In the course of her
career, Dr O’Sullivan has seen a fair
number of patients who are ill, and
have all the signs of being ill,without
actually having anything physically
wrong with them. Psychosomatic
illness is not something people are
happy to talk about or accept readily
– which patient wants to be told
that what they’re experiencing is ‘all
in your head ’? Yet, as Dr O’Sullivan
points out in her speech in which
she described a woman who
eventually became paralysed due to
her psychosomatic illness – “If your
mind can get your body to start an
action,why can’t it stop actions too?”
In these cases, books not only

factors that affect psychosomatic
illness, but also make it accessible to
the public and encourage discussion
of difficult issues. Literature
provides an insight into situations
where our deepest convictions are
challenged, and reading then gives
us the collective experience of what
it means to be human.
