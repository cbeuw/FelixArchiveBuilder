The four types of traveller you’ll meet this summer

t's almost the end of the
academic year, meaning many
of you will be in that final
frenzy of wrapping up your
final year projects. From frantic
pipetting to manic coding, it's all
very stressful – I've been there. But
for those of you, much like myself
a year ago, the end of uni does not
equal a cry from relief. It means
facing your boggart which, let’s be
honest, is far more soul wrenching
than Harry's dementor – the
dreaded prospect of unemployment.
When you finally managed to
smash that Goldman interview (it
only took you 566 attempts not to
fuck up, but who's counting, right?),
you've got a few months before you
become a real person in September,
when that dollar blinding grad
scheme starts, and there's only one
thing to do – that generic gap yah
thing and book an open ticket to a
generic gap yah destination, much
like me. I'm currently cotching in
South East Asia, and as a (self-
proclaimed) seasoned traveller, I'm
going to enlighten you with the six
types of backpackers you'll meet, to
mentally prepare you for your own
shenanigans.
1) The Enthused Yank
Much like a puppy on crack, this
breed of backpacker has far too
much love for life and energy than
should be legally allowed. Along
with speaking at unsafely high
decibel levels, rivalling that filthy
bass at Ministry, the enthused yank
is also brimming with bullshit.
He'll recount his travelling tales
with such dramatics, you'll wonder
how this kid is still alive. Cyclones
and lightning storms will feature,
sunrises penetrating his spirit will
be routine, and inevitably, there
will be a mention of a divine
intervention or two. Two days spent
with this freak may drive you over
the edge, so make sure you get out
of that awkward hangout before he
mentions that time when he casually
parted the Red Sea.
2) The Premature
Mid-Life Crisis Dude
Every hostel has one. It's that
dude who's 30, quit his soul-
destroying job, broken up with bae,
and decided to fuck off overseas to
find himself, spiritually of course,
whilst partying with school leavers
in a dingy nightclub seedier than
Cheapskates (RIP).
With a constant yearning for
affirmation, and clingier than gum
on a tube seat, this dude will not
leave you alone.This is even after you
EU myths debunked
What the Leave campaign says is going on versus what is actually going on

he claim: The EU open-
borders policy puts
strain on the UK and
makes it harder for non-
Europeans to settle in the UK.
The facts: According to a report
by the Migration Observatory in
2011, 95% of net migration to the
UK was that of non-EU nationals.
The EU has no power over UK
immigration policies for non-
Europeans. Under EU policy,
citizens of EU countries can settle in
the UK and work at any job without
a visa. UK citizens can do the
same in EU countries. According
to the aforementioned report, the
immigration of EU nationals to
the UK is roughly offset by the
emigration of UK nationals to other
EU countries.
Before non-Europeans work in
the UK, they must be accepted to a
position in the shortage occupation
list that meets the minimum
skills threshold. Then they may
apply for a work visa – a long,
bureaucratic process for them and
their potential employer. The UK
recently changed its immigration
policy in an explicit pledge to lower
net migration, making it more
difficult for non-Europeans to settle
in the UK in an explicit pledge to
lower net migration. The recent
restrictions and regulations include
shortening the shortage occupation
list and increasing the minimum
skills threshold, increasing the
requirements for institutions and
businessestosponsornon-European
students or employees, raising the
minimum salary for a work visa, and
increasing restrictions on bringing
family members to the UK. A UK
citizen who marries abroad cannot
return with their non-European
spouse unless they prove that they
have an annual income exceeding
£18,600 (or more if they have
children). 47% of British citizens –
in particular, 61% of British women
– do not meet this requirement.
The bottom line: Any suggestion
that the EU open-borders policy
disadvantages the UK is baseless,
and any claim that the EU has a
negative impact on non-Europeans
wishing to immigrate to the UK is
a lie.
The claim: The EU is an anti-
democratic organisation.
The facts: There are three bodies
involved in EU legislation. The
Council of the EU (made up
of government ministers of EU
countries) and the EU Parliament
(elected by citizens of EU countries
by proportional representation) are
the only bodies which pass EU
laws and policies. The European
Commission just draws up proposals
for new EU legislation to be voted
on; it cannot pass laws. It comprises
28 Commissioners – one for each
EU country – who are suggested by
their respective governments and
must be voted in by the European
Parliament. The Commission’s
own president must be supported
by the majority of members of the
European Parliament to be elected.
The bottom line: Legislation and
laws are passed by EU countries’
government ministers and elected
European Parliament members.
Those involved in writing and
enforcing legislation are elected by
Parliament members and EU heads
of state. This procedure is different
to the one at, say, Westminster,
but all contemporary so-called
democratic governments are
somewhere on a spectrum between
democracy and bureaucracy. “The
EU is anti-democratic” is an empty
and hypocritical claim.
The claim: We won’t lose out on
Erasmus, non-EU countries already
take part in the programme.We can
be like Switzerland!
The facts: Switzerland first
participated in Erasmus in the
academic year 1992/3, but in the
same year voted against joining
the EEA, ending its participation
in all EU education programmes.
In the early 2000s Switzerland
and the EU signed agreements
including freedom of movement,
and in 2011 Switzerland regained
full participation in Erasmus; but its
eligibility was revoked again in 2014
after it voted to limit immigration
through quotas, breaking its free
movement treaties. The Swiss
government then arranged the
interim solution of allocating
$25million to fund Swiss students
studying in Europe and Europeans
studying in Switzerland,allowing an
exchange programme to continue.
Today it is an Erasmus Partner
Country, meaning it can participate
under certain conditions.
The bottom line: Free movement
of people is an EU requirement
for participation in its education
programmes. As the UK does
not intend to keep its open-
borders policy if it leaves the EU,
it will struggle to maintain its full
participation status,and considering
the UK’s domestic education
policies, it is unlikely to set up an
interim programme, Switzerland-
style.
The claim: Leaving the EU won’t
affect European stability. It’s not
parted ways six weeks ago, thanks
to social media; his Facebook posts
rival both the abundance, and the
(shit) quality of the status updates
of your 14-year-old self. Mock all
we may at the tragic nature of this
dude's escapades, but through that
thick wall of judgement, nothing
seems to be able to get rid of that
niggling at the back of your head
pestering you,that this guy may be a
hazy prediction of your own future.
3) The I'm not a tourist,
tourist
Obsessed with shedding her
western ways of thinking, and
insistent she's not travelling for the
Instagram glory, this backpacker's
not on holiday, she's on a cultural
voyage. Dismissing home comforts
is at the forefront of her priorities,
because in her mind, no where East
has gone through the Stone Age.
Western toilets? No, it's all about
the squatting, like the locals do. A
highly rated Tripadvisor hostel? No
chance, it's all about shacking up
with a stranger in their hut, with
no air conditioning when it's 41°C,
much like a local. Bottle of Evian,

a peacekeeping mechanism and
there’s no European war coming
anyway.
The facts: The EU started in 1950,
uniting European countries to
secure lasting peace after a long era
of prevailing wars.The 1990s saw the
fall of communism and completion
of the single market, including
freedom of movement, with
European nations on closer terms
than ever. Today, across Europe, the
political far-right is on the rise. For
instance, this April, the Freedom
Party of Austria lost the second
round of presidential elections by
less than 1% of the votes, and in
March the Alternative for Germany
party won over 13% of the votes in
German local elections. What these
and other far-right parties across
Europe have in common is extreme
nationalism and xenophobic anti-
immigration policies.
The bottom line: Countries
united economically and politically
are less likely to go to war against
each other. It is easy in a time of
peace to forget that war could ever
again happen in Europe, but this
is ignoring history to the point of
denial. If the UK leaves the EU, the
moderate European governments
will continue their peaceful
relations – but with the alarming
Europe-wide rise of nationalism
and xenophobia, which European
governments we will see in 10 years?
In 20 years?
Clingier
than gum
on a tube
seat, this
dude will
not leave
you alone
perhaps? Screw that, a refreshing
glass of water from the river will
do, emulating the local way of life.
Comfort is overrated, guys, the
locals don't have any, why should
we? Did I mention how important
it is to live like a local? I mean, once
you've lived like them for a couple
of days, it's the same as an entire
lifetime without Netflix, right?
4) The Perfect Human
Like a rabbit in headlights, this
solo traveller will beckon to be
rescued by you and your squad.
Yet, as time passes, and bonding
intensifies, those puppy eyes will
steal your heart and your possy
will develop an obsession for this
stray. The fan-girling may become
unhealthy, but it's all part of the
top notch bants. The day will come
when you part ways with this
stranger – you've got to let them
leave the nest after all. But when
that Facebook photo materialises
with bae and her new crew, your
blood will boil and intense voodoo
may be performed. As Harry Styles
warned us, everybody wanna steal
my girl. But her heart is mine for
the taking, so back off, yeah?!
