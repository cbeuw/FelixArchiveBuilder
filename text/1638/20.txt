espite a number
of premature
announcements earlier
this week, E3 looks to
be as exciting as ever. For gamers
there’s no time of the year that is
more anticipated and for gaming
journalists (which I don’t qualify
as yet) there is none hated more.
While a few early leaks and reveals
exception – for the past few years
they have moved away from
the traditional press format and
exclusivity of E3 (and it’s physical
presence in LA).
Broadcasting ‘Nintendo Directs’,
they have been able to bypass the
cost and effort of a physical press
conference.And with the slow death
of theWii U,Nintendo have decided
to forgo even an online conference
and will instead be focusing almost
entirely on the latest Legend of
Zelda game in a number of streams
called ‘Nintendo Treehouse Live’.
A few other previously announced
games including Pokemon Sun and
Moon, Pokemon Go, and Monster
Hunter Generations will also be
livestreamed from the conference
floor. Apart from that, don’t expect
many surprises.
In more exciting news, Sony
are set to reveal details of a more
powerful, upgraded Playstation
4. New games will be able to take
advantage of the reportedly large
graphical processing power increase
but will have to continue to support
the original model. This is seen by
many in the industry as a reaction
to the smartphone sector’s model of
yearly iterative hardware upgrades.
Not only will the console be
capable of outputting 4K it will
also be, as a result of improved
hardware, a more compelling reason
to purchase Playstation VR this
autumn. Last year, Sony surprised
fans with the announcement of
Final Fantasy VII and Shenmue 3,
and many will hope to be as blown
away this time round. It’s likely
we’ll see gameplay from Destiny:
Rise of Iron, a release date and more
gameplay for The Last Guardian,and
a possible appearance from Rockstar
(a new game in the Red Dead
franchise is heavily rumoured).
The announcement of a new Xbox
is less likely but a number of insiders
have hinted that the new Xbox One
will be targeting a performance
of six teraflops (whatever that
means). Microsoft will show more
of the already leaked Titanfall 2,
more from Halo Wars 2 which was
teased at least year’s conference,
and lots of Gears of War 4 gameplay.
So basically lots of guys (and now
girls) with guns. Rare will show off
more of their open-world pirate
game Sea of Thieves, finally free from
developing the awfully dull Kinect
Sports games. It’s amazing how
quickly the internet, and gaming
press, have forgotten that the
Kinect was originally bundled with
the Xbox One, much to the anger
of gamers in 2013. Luckily, those
terrible days are past us now and
we’re now blessed instead with an
endless stream of largely uninspired
sequels. Don’t expect Microsoft to
show any major new IPs this year.
While previous console
generations seemed to rely more
on exclusives, the success of the
industry in the last few years has
come about largely as the result of an
increase in cross-platform releases.
Third-parties just aren’t willing to
take the risk, even when there are
large financial incentives from the
console makers. Ubisoft might
finally deliver on the promise of
the original Watch Dogs trailer with
Watch Dogs 2 which will be set in San
Francisco. And EA will show off
their World War One first-person
shooter Battlefield 1. Will Battlefield
1 be respectful of the horrific events
of the the Great War? Probably not,
but at least it’s set in an alternative
universe. Bethesda will reveal more
of Dishonoured 2 and the two new
playable characters (this time you
can choose your gender) and it’s
rumoured that they will announce a
definitive edition of Skyrim, making
it playable for the first time on the
PS4 and Xbox One. Outside of the
larger publishers, a leak on Tuesday
revealed that Injustice 2, the DC
arcade fighting game, will be
Warner Brother’s biggest showing.
Other rumours have suggested that
Don’t
expect
Microsoft to
show any
major new
IPs this
year Ubisoft
might finally
deliver
on the
promise of
the original
Watch
Dogs trailer
a number of titles based on Marvel
properties (including Spider-Man)
will also be shown off. Despite
the success of the film franchise,
so far there has been little effort
to produce games based on the
cinematic universe’s vast array of
characters.
have surprised some, this offload
ahead of the expo’s official start next
week could be a sign that the major
publishers have lots to show this
year.
Nintendo seem to be the one
