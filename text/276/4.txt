LSE SACKINGS
UNITE STUDENTS
Following the sackings cf LSS leetur-
ers, Robin Blackburn and Nicholas Bateson
for supporting the students earlier this
year, fresh troubles plague LSE.
Bateson and Blackburn will probably
fight the dismissals in the courts as
LSE articles of association grant staff
members the right to hold and promulgate
any opinions •whatsoever. She apparent
attack on academic freedom by Walter
Adams (LSE Director) and Lord Robbins
(Governor's chairman} lias; provoked oppos-
ition from staff, workers and a l l types
of student. Right-wing LSE 'resident
Chris Bryce condemned the sackings as a
"deliberate provocation" end the stud- .
ents4 voted 2jJS8 to 2
*
2 for a lecture boy-
cott which started last licnday. Support
from the staff union (AUT) and the work-
ers (AS1US) is expected. MJS has already
"fully supported" the action of the LSI
Union.
Latest FELIX reports from LSE suggest
both moderate and militant opinion is
united and the boycott is going well
«».th growing staff support.
