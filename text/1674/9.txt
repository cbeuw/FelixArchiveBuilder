7 DAYS
7 NIGHTS
Krept & Konan abandon the London underground in
their new mixtapes 7 Days and 7 Nights
The new work shows they’re shifting towards the mainstream, but they haven’t chosen the right direction.
K
rept and Konan,
the established
rap duo from
South London,
put out a pair of albums
two weeks ago in their
first major releases since
their return to the London
music scene. The albums
are drastically different in
style: 7 Days feels more
like a compilation of
their attempts at different
genres (with a few bangers
thrown in), while 7 Nights
is a collection of R&B
slow jams. These albums
demonstrate a commit-
ment to their departure
from the underground
scene to pursue main-
stream success.
For background, the
pair started out in the
London rap scene – a
couple of youngers in polo
shirts rapping about gang
life in Thornton Heath.
These early tracks and
freestyles were angry and
gritty; although not being
heavily involved in gang
activities, they shared
experiences and stories of
the people around them.
And these raw lyrics
(often set to an American
hip-hop beat, or, very
rarely, a grime instrumen-
tal) connected with some,
and shocked others. The
duo gained notoriety and
eventually became one of
the biggest names in the
underground London rap
scene. Their lyrics were
smart and the wordplay
was clever, referencing
more and more obscure
parts of London culture,
endearing them to people
sympathetic to their
struggle. They received
a lot of attention through
YouTube channels like
SBTV, and through their
early mixtapes, some of
which attained notoriety
in the mainstream.
What really helped
them blow up was the
track ‘Don’t Waste My
Time’, in particular the
line “Excuse my French,
I ain’t worried ‘bout
nothin’”, which brought
on an all-star remix with
Coke Boys. The song
to return to London with
their original flow, with
the respect and weight of
having made it globally.
In fact, you get some
impression of this on 7
Days: the track ‘Robbery’,
released last summer, felt
a lot like their old tracks.
The play on ‘Jack in the
Box’ in the first verse
and even the reference to
their first mixtape were
reminiscent of Krept’s
clever, cheeky wordplay.
And when that came out, it
felt like they had a sort of
godfather status, putting
this unknown rapper Abra
Cadabra on, and surround-
ing themselves with the
best in the scene. The
penultimate track, ‘Last
Night In LA’ (which is my
favourite on the album,
also released a year ago),
had the sense that these
legends had returned to
their domain, equipped
with better production and
a taste of fame. Konan
talks about their progres-
sion from the road to the
stage, referencing the
people he made it with and
even the beef with Church
Road.
Unfortunately, the
rest of the album doesn’t
make sense. Krept starts
rapping in a silly Vybz
Kartel style accent on
the ‘Controlla’-sounding
dancehall track ‘For Me’,
which I don’t think he’s
ever done before, and is
certainly not known for.
And ‘WoWoWo’, which
they are trying to push as
one of the main bangers
of the album, has such
a dull, plain hook; even
in the verses they keep
repeating those three
meaningless syllables.
The whole album feels
like they’re just trying to
create bangers in every
genre possible: trap,
drill, dancehall, afrobeat.
Anything. Maybe they’re
trying to hedge their bets
on current trends, or just
churning out generic
tracks because it’s easy,
this sense, it feels very lost
and empty as an album
– more like a top 11 UK
music compilation.
7 Nights is more
together: the PARTYNEX-
TDOOR vibe combined
with Nines-style vocals
runs throughout. Actually,
it does feel a lot like Nines’
‘One Foot Out’, even fea-
turing the same vocalist
Hudson East heavily on
both albums (which feels
like a betrayal to their
area). And the topics of
the tracks depart from the
usual grimy gang stories to
stories of ladies and their
promiscuous relationships
with them. None of the
tracks particularly stand
out, but the consistent
theme and interesting
features don’t make it a
terrible album.
I guess my main issue
with these albums is the
fact that they have aban-
doned the London under-
ground scene to pursue
fame. It seems that they
want to change directions
as artists to something
more suitable for main-
stream, although they
haven’t really chosen the
exact direction yet. It’s a
shame as they are amazing
lyricists, and it’s frus-
trating that they chose to
limit their talent in a trade
off for catchy hooks and
palatable verses. They are
definitely still in it for the
hustle, which is admirable,
and they have achieved a
tremendous amount from
humble beginnings. But
hopefully we’ll still see
them on those Link Up TV
features now and then.
“While some
tracks mark a
return to their
original flow,
the remainder
of 7 Days
doesn’t make
sense”
brought them worldwide
attention, with the likes of
French Montana, YG, and
Jeremih looking to col-
laborate. From there, they
signed with Def Jam and
did a heavily trap-inspired
album, with features from
loads ofAmerican rappers,
slowing down their flow to
appeal to their global fans.
And this worked for them
in terms of popularity: the
track ‘Freak of the Week’
was blowing up every-
where, even if the signa-
ture Krept and Konan flow
wasn’t that prominent.
See, I thought after
the previous album in the
States, they were going
“Maybe Krept
& Konan are
trying to
hedge their
bets on current
trends, but it
doesn’t feel
like they care
for the quality
of the music”
but it certainly doesn’t
feel like they care for the
quality of the music. So in
The ting goes skrrrrrr... // Virgin EMI
