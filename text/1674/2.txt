The centre is the latest
part of Imperial’s
ambitious White City
Campus to be opened
to the public.
Fred Fyles
Editor-in-Chief
A
new commu-
nity space
was opened
at Imperial
College’s White City
Campus last weekend.
The Invention Rooms,
which the College
describes as “a unique
space for community
innovation in White City”,
were opened during a free
public event last Saturday,
28th October. The venue
includes the ‘Reach Out
Makerspace’, which
allows young people to
have access to equipment
for design and manu-
facturing, and will host
collaborative programmes
with schools from the local
area, teaching them how
to develop and produce an
idea.
The Invention Rooms
will also play host to
the Imperial College
will be more hotly con-
tested in future, hopefully
helping to attract better
quality candidates.”
The College said that
this decision was made “in
recognition of the valued
contribution that the GSU
President makes to enrich
the experiences of post-
graduate students, as well
as the responsibility and
time-commitment that the
role involves.”
In a statement, a Union
representative told Felix:
“Imperial College Union
GSU stipend raises funding questions for other CUs
and the Graduate Students’
Union work in partnership
with the College’s Grad-
uate School to improve
the experience of our
postgraduate members.
The value of this collab-
oration is demonstrated
by the Graduate School’s
commitment to provide an
annual stipend to the GSU
President to enable them
to work even more effec-
tively on behalf of their
members as well as con-
tinue on their research.”
It is not clear what this
development will mean
for the Presidents of other
Constituent Unions (CU).
Currently, the only paid
positions are the GSU
President, and the Im-
perial College School of
Medicine Students Union
(ICSMSU) President, who
is an elected sabbatical
officer. Felix spoke to a
number of CU Presidents,
who said that they would
be interested to see what
it means for their roles:
Claudia Caravello, Presi-
dent of the City and Guilds
College Union (CGCU)
said “I think it will be
exciting to see how this
goes. While the position is
a voluntary role, it is very
time demanding, regularly
exceeding the hours the
Union expects of a vol-
unteer, making it hard to
hold down other part-time
jobs. Being paid ensures
that the GSU President
can do their job to the best
capacity without having
to compromise their own
personal life too much.”
Michael Edwards, Presi-
dent of Royal College of
Science Union (RCSU),
told Felix “I welcome
this development and
applaud the Union and
Graduate School for this
vital change identifying a
significant student leader.
I look forward to opening
discussions of my own
with the Union and the
Faculty of Natural Scienc-
es to negotiate a similar
arrangement.”
However, a Union
representative told Felix
that “neither Imperial
College Union or any
College faculties has
plans to make any other
Constituent Union roles
paid at this time. We are
always working to support
our Constituent Unions
as part of our ongoing
commitment to a strong
democracy and are excited
to see the conversations
this may start with other
Faculties.”
Imperial’s Graduate
School provides a number
of professional skills
courses and coaching.
They say they aim to
ensure “all postgraduate
students are provided with
excellent professional de-
velopment training com-
plementing their academic
studies and providing op-
portunity to develop skills
for a range of careers.”
They also undertake re-
search projects in higher
education studies, which
guide College policy.

Advanced Hackspace
(ICAH). The ICAH,
which was founded in
2014, provides access to
manufacturing equipment
for staff and students;
one of their core aims is
“to build a community of
like-minded makers and
experimenters.” Professor
Oscar Ces, a member of
the ICAH board, said
that the new space would
“stimulate interaction and
collaboration, not just
across the College, but
also with external partners,
small and medium-sized
enterprises, industry, and
“a beacon for communi-
ty-driven innovation”, and
said that “The impact of
this will be transforma-
tive, boosting opportunity,
aspiration and innovation
in White City and beyond
for decades to come.” She
also highlighted the im-
portance of working with
the community: “This
means listening to their
needs, tapping into their
talents, and – crucially –
opening our doors.”
On their website, the
College say that they are
“committed to making
a positive impact in the
local area” around White
City, and wish to “work
together with White City
residents, businesses, and
organisations.”
The Invention Rooms
are the latest section of the
Imperial College White
City Campus. Imperial
College first bought land
in White City back in
2009; the northern half of
the campus was granted
planning permission in
2012, and construction
has been progressing
since then. The Molecular
Sciences Research Hub is
set to open in 2018, and
will provide a new home
for the Department of
Chemistry.
The campus is dominat-
ed by a 35-storey tower,
which saw its topping out
ceremony in September.
The tower, whose £76.2
million contract was
awarded to Laing O’Ro-
urke, will provide 133
private housing units, and
59 units available to Impe-
rial ‘key workers’. The St
Helens Residents Associa-
tion in North Kensington
has been campaigning
against the development
for the last six years,
accusing the College of
acting like an “aggressive
property developer when
it comes to the planning
and design of its buildings,
and their impact on their
neighbours.”
The Invention Rooms
will be expanded in spring
2018, with the addition
of new venue space and a
café.

also play host

Provost (Academic
Partnerships), who is the

Amazon, what’s good?
A
nyone who’s
interested in
campus politics
and changes
to higher education will
have seen phrases like
‘safe spaces’ bandied
around in the media like
there’s no tomorrow. The
general idea – and I’m
paraphrasing here – is
that the students of today
are too soft, and too
mollycoddled, they’re
‘special snowflakes’ who
don’t understand the ‘real
world’. You know the line
of argument I’m talking
about.
While I generally think
this is a bullshit portrayal
of students, I do feel
strongly that Felix has a
vital role to play in any
debate around free speech.
A fundamental aspect of
a democratic society is a
free press – one in which
people have the right to
upset, or to make strong
points on what the believe
in. Just this past week,
we’ve had a couple of
articles in our Comment
section that have prompted
a very strong reaction. I
think that this is a great
thing – the reactions we
get to our Comment pieces
shows that the stereotype
of apathetic Imperial
students is not the case.
With that in mind, I
want to make an appeal
to any students who
are outraged or upset
at things we publish:
please get involved!
Drop us an email, write
a response article, start a
conversation. Felix is only
biased in one way, and
that’s towards those who
actually write for us – we
can’t promote your views
if you don’t let us know
what they are.
However, if you’re a
multinational tech giant,
then please stay out of
my inbox. Earlier this
week, we published an
online-only long-read by
our Politics Editor Avi
Banerjee, about the rise
of the tech monopolies.
In the piece, which is
absolutely fantastic, Avi
describes the rise of tech
giants like Facebook and
Google, and compares
them to the monopolies
that existed in America
during the Gilded Age.
Back then, the dangers
of such powerful organ-
isations was recognised,
and they were broken up,
but today we seem to be
sleepwalking into exactly
the same situation.
One of the companies he
mentioned was Amazon.
You know, the place you
get all your worldly goods
from, who pay a miniscule
amount of tax in propor-
tion to their size, and who
– I would argue – have
put extreme pressure on
independent booksellers
and music stores. The
article wasn’t even up
online for 12 hours before
I got a voicemail and an
email from someone in
the Amazon press office,
asking I get in touch with
them as soon as possible.
It seems they’d taken issue
with some of the things
we’d published, and asked
for clarifications.
The guy I spoke to was
perfectly nice, but the
whole thing was extreme-
ly unsettling – if they can
get in touch less than 12
hours after an article has
gone online, from a small
student paper (we’d like
to big ourselves up, but
hey, we’re small fry), then
I doubt they’d have any
qualms about beginning
litigation. The article has
since been taken down,
pending amendments, but
it will be back up very
soon, and I urge you all
to check it out. In many
ways, this just proves
Avi’s point that the tech
giants could soon stifle
anything that resembles
criticism of their business
practices.
In the meantime, I know
where my Xmas presents
are going to come from:
my local independent
shops, with nary a delivery
drone in sight.
