Future Hndrxx Tour: an enjoyable, if not all that
memorable, performance
Following on from the surprise release of two albums within a week, Future heads to the O2 Arena, for a greatest
hits set, whose energy levels sometimes slip.

n February, Atlanta
rapper Future
surprised fans
by releasing his
eponymous fifth studio
album with little advance
warning. FUTURE is
a seventeen-track trap
offering that went straight
to number one in its
first week. However,
although Future’s fans
were satisfied, Future was
not. A mere seven days
later, Future went on to
do the unheard of and
dropped his sixth album,
HNDRXX. Future shows
his more sensitive side on
HNDRXX and the album
also debuted atop the
Billboard charts. In having
two different albums
debut at number one in
consecutive weeks, Future
accomplished a feat that
no other artist in music
history has. He swiftly
followed up this success
by announcing the Future
Hndrxx Tour, which con-
cluded in London’s O2
Arena last Monday.
Future had Zoey Dollaz,
Rich The Kid, and Stefflon
Don in support but all
three acts failed to suffi-
ciently raise the crowd’s
energy levels. The crowd
was subsequently restless
by the time Future took to
the stage (20 minutes late,
I might add). However,
Future turned things
around with his strong
opening performance
of FUTURE album cut,
‘Draco’. Future has built
a reputation as an artist
with a seemingly tireless
work ethic, dropping
mixtapes and albums at an
alarmingly rapid rate over
the last 5 years. There was
also a period when Future
was hip-hop’s go-to guy
for a hook or feature and,
as a result, the man simply
has an insurmountable
mass of music to perform.
He had the whole arena
rocking with fan favour-
ites ‘Thought It was a
Drought’, ‘Stick Talk’,
and ‘Sh!t’.
Although this show
was supposedly in support
of his two 2017 albums,
Future effectively turned
it into a showcase of his
greatest hits, stretching all
the way back to the start
of his career. It was dis-
appointing that he didn’t
in the arena but, instead,
Future bombarded us with
high energy bangers all
night. There were times
when Future appeared
to be lacking energy
but he performed with
four dancers who hyped
the crowd during those
periods when he was
struggling to keep up. He
also brought Rich The
Kid, Stefflon Don, and
Wizkid out during his set,
with Wizkid in particular
receiving a rapturous
reception. Future returned
to perform ‘Mask Off’,
his viral smash hit off of
FUTURE and ended his
set with ‘March Madness’
(arguably the best song
of all time). Overall, the
show was fun but there
were times when the
energy felt a bit lifeless
and it raises the question
of whether it’s worth
seeing artists like Future,
who have countless high
energy bangers but whose
music arguably lacks sub-
stance, in concert. In this
case, I would have to say
no – save your £55.
perform any of HNDRXX
as this would have been
a welcome switch of vibe
“There

crowd”
