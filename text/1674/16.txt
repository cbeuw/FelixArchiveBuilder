10. Natalie Portman
Best Performances:
Black Swan, Jackie,
Closer
Bursting onto the
scene aged 13 in Luc
Besson’s cult thriller
Léon: The Professional,
Portman is one of those
few child actors who has
managed to maintain a
constant stream of work
well into adulthood, and
she has done so to great
acclaim. She has worked
with a number of notable
filmmakers, including
Besson, Michael Mann,
Wong Kar Wai, George
Lucas, Terrence Malick,
Darren Aronofsky, Pablo
Larrain, Wes Anderson,
Woody Allen, Tim Burton,
Anthony Minghella,
8. Maggie Cheung
Best Performances:
In the Mood for Love,
Clean, Days of Being
Wild, 2046, Hero
Raised in Britain and
Hong Kong, Cheung’s
inclusion on this list is
somewhat controversial
considering that she has
not acted in a film since
2010, and it is unclear
if she will be returning.
There are rumours that
she will be returning for
Wong Kar Wai’s next
project, Blossoms, and
going off that, she is
included. Anyone who has
seen the best of Cheung,
a woman renowned for
her elegant portrayals
of fierce women in sim-
mering dramas, would be
somewhat surprised that
at the beginning of her
career she was typecast
in comedic roles as weak
and clumsy women. That
all changed when she was
cast in Wong’s As Tears
Go By, a moment Cheung
herself cites as the true
beginning of her serious
acting career. This would
be the start of a fruitful
collaboration, with the
7. Naomi Watts
Best Performances:
Mulholland Dr., 21
Grams, Eastern Prom-
ises, Funny Games,
The Ring
English Watts struggled
to gain any traction in the
entertainment industry
until her thirties. Her early
career consisted mainly
of Australian television
spots, including a recur-
ring stint on Home and
Away, and a number of
near misses, including au-
ditioning five times for the
female lead in Meet the
Parents before being told
she was ‘not sexy enough’
(ugh). Then, at the turn of
the century, the legendary
David Lynch picked up
Watts’ headshot, and in a
turn of events that eerily
resembles a famous scene
in his surrealist neo-noir
psychological thriller
masterpiece, cast Watts
as the lead in Mulholland
Dr. Watts is astonishing
in what is an incredible
film, and this dichotomous
6. Amy Adams
Best Performances:
The Master, Junebug,
Doubt, American Hus-
tle, The Fighter, Arrival
Born in Italy, American
Amy Adams’ entire
filmography is from the
21st century, with her
first major role coming
in Spielberg’s Catch Me
If You Can. However, she
became unemployed a
year later, and her break-
through role didn’t arrive
until 2005’s Junebug, for
which she garnered his
first Oscar nomination.
Since then, these nods
have been a regular
occurrence, and yet for
some reason the Academy
seems to hate the extreme-
ly likeable Adams. Five
nominations and no wins.
And she wasn’t even nom-
9. Tilda Swinton
Best Performances:
We Need to Talk About
Kevin, Michael Clay-
ton, Orlando, Burn Af-
ter Reading, Only Lov-
ers Left Alive
Though Brit actress
Swinton’s career spans
back to the mid 80s, she
has only really began to be
noticed in the 21st
century
when she began taking
supporting roles in more
mainstream films. Even
then, she only truly came
into the public eye with
her Oscar-winning sup-
porting role as a ruthless
lawyer on the verge of
a mental breakdown in
Michael Clayton. Make no
mistake though – Swinton
is far more than a sup-
porting character actress,
well capable of seizing
the reigns as a lead, best
demonstrated in Lynne
Ramsay’s We Need to
Talk About Kevin and Jim
Jarmusch’s Only Lovers
Left Alive. A rock star, an
unfulfilled wife searching
for more, a vampire rec-
onciling with her partner,
a mother battling to love
her strange child – Swin-
ton’s filmography is one
of the most diverse in
the industry. Also an ac-
two teaming up on Days of
Being Wild, Ashes of Time,
In the Mood for Love, and
2046. Though she has
worked very infrequently
this century, she makes
this list on the strength of
the few projects she does
take. Cheung acts with
grace and fire in equal
measures, and it is always
spellbinding to watch her
balance these elements in
each one of her delicate
performances.
performance alone is
good enough to warrant
a place on this list. Since
then she has been best
in her Oscar-nominated
turns in 21 Grams and
The Impossible, as well
as under the wing of great
directors David Cronen-
berg and Michael Haneke
in Eastern Promises and
Funny Games respective-
ly. Yet it is her character
in Mulholland Dr. that
will stick long in the
memory, demonstrating
a truly remarkable range,
and making one think that
Watts could convince in
any role.
inated for a terrific perfor-
mance in Arrival last year
while Meryl Streep was
once again invited to the
Dolby Theatre for singing
badly in Florence Foster
Jenkins, a film where she
was heavily outshone by
Hugh Grant. To be fair,
she has always been up
against solid opposition,
losing to the likes of Cate
Blanchett, Penelope Cruz,
Rachel Weisz, and Melissa
Leo. That being said, she
should surely have won
for her tremendously
controlled performance in
The Master ahead of Anne
Hathaway in Les Misera-
bles. Though Adams has
dabbled in blockbuster
fayre in her role as Lois
Lane in the Superman
films, she has largely stuck
to working with artistic
auteurs, such as Paul
Thomas Anderson, David
O. Russell, Spike Jonze,
Mike Nichols, Denis Vil-
leneuve, and Tom Ford. So
long as she continues this
career path, surely she will
one day get up on stage
to collect a golden statue.
Her next opportunity will
come in Adam McKay’s
2018 Dick Cheney biopic
Backseat, starring Chris-
tian Bale.
We will be concluding
our countdown of the

Wonder Women: who rules the silver screen?
Inspired by the discussion on who will succeed Sir Daniel Day-Lewis as the best actor in the world, we look at the
greatest actresses on the planet. Our first part is this week – tune in next week to see who made it to number one!

F
ollowing the re-
lease of the trailer
for Sir Daniel
Day-Lewis’ final
film, Phantom Thread, last
week, I looked at who may
attempt to fill his enor-
mous boots as the finest
actor in the world. There
were a number of excel-
lent candidates, and in the
end Day-Lewis’ fellow
Paul Thomas Anderson
collaborator Joaquin
Phoenix came out on top.
While thankfully there is
no such retirement from
our female thespians to
spark a similar discussion,
I have decided to pose the
question nonetheless. We
are in a golden age for
actresses, with the number
of elite female screen stars
at the very least matching,
and quite probably out-
numbering the quantity of
their male counterparts.
It has been posited
by some that awards
for acting should not be
divided by gender, in the
same way that they are not
for directing or writing, or
any other category for that
matter. The only reason
the divide stills exists is
lead performance in years
gone by. Take last year
– the two best lead perfor-
mances by some distance
were Isabelle Huppert in
Elle and Casey Affleck in
Manchester by the Sea (if
in this hypothetical situa-
tion there were still only
five nominees then the rest
of the field may well be
made up by actresses con-
sidering the accomplish-
ments of Natalie Portman
in Jackie, Annette Bening
in 20th Century Women,
Sonia Braga in Aquarius
and Sandra Huller in Toni
Erdmann, though Adam
Driver was a delight in
Paterson). An intriguing
battle, and as devastatingly
good Affleck is at commu-
nicating emotional turmoil
in his stooped posture and
mumbled speech, Hup-
pert’s performance was a
tour de force that surely
would have come out on
top (although considering
she lost the actual real-life
Academy Award to Emma
Stone for La La Land,
she would probably be
unjustly beaten again –
you can’t escape fuck-ups
by the Academy even in
the hypothetical realm).
It is difficult to de-
termine whether this
prominence is down to
a particular purple patch
for women acting in film,
in the sense that many
have emerged together
by chance, or whether
there have always been
vast quantities of great
actresses, and that in the
past we were only able to
see a few due to limited
opportunities in a histor-
ically sexist industry. It
could be argued that were
there more substantial
roles written for women
over the past fifty years,
we could have seen twenty
Hepburns instead of just
two. Or more contempo-
raries to the likes of Taylor,
Bergman and Leigh. Our
pig-headed discrimination
by gender has robbed us of
great art. That is not to say
that enough female char-
acters are being scripted
in the present day. Far too
many times we see these
incredible talents have to
play second fiddle to their
male colleagues, often
submissively portraying
the object of love and lust,
rather than a fully fleshed
out human being with
their own ideas, thoughts
formers, the industry will
soon be left with no choice
but to bow down and give
them the significant roles
they deserve, and have
deserved for a very long
time.
(Note: This is a list of
the best actresses working
today. It was incredibly
difficult to whittle it down
to just ten, and the differ-
ence between some on this
list is negligible. That is a
testament to the astound-
ing talent of the women
on screen that we have the
pleasure of watching work.
