A
lot of great liter-
ature has served
as excellent
snapshots into
the culture and attitudes
of the society that the
author describes. Yukio
Mishima’s Sea of Fertility
Tetralogy is a perfect
example of that. The te-
tralogy consists of Spring
Snow, Runaway Horses,
The Temple of Dawn, and
The Decay of the Angel,
in that order, and while I
have sadly only read two
of the four thus far, that
was enough to leave a pro-
found impression on me.
Mishima constructs
a narrative centred
around the characters
of Shigekuni Honda, an
aspiring law student who
becomes a respected
lawyer then judge, and
Kiyoaki Matsugae, who
appears in the first book
as a fellow student born
to an aristocratic family,
but is reincarnated as
various other characters
in subsequent books. In
constructing the story,
what I found remark-
able is how Mishima
weaves both strands of
his own personal life
and the flavour of Japan
throughout the 20th
century into a sublime
read. Mishima’s prolific
output of great works
and standing have led
to him being nominated
for the Nobel Prize in
Literature twice and
the Mishima award was
named in his honour.
Spring Snow was set
in 1912 – the beginning
of the Taisho period,
which followed on from
the Meiji era, a time of
significant change to the
fabric of Japanese society
through modernisation
and the increasing influ-
ence of Western thought.
The details and broader
analysis of the Meiji
era are well explored
and documented in
various works, but any
meaningful discussion
of it would be beyond
this review. However,
I encourage interested
readers to review 20th
century Japanese history
for their own pleasure
and perhaps an enhanced
appreciation of the
series.
Mishima developed
an ensemble of charac-
ters in the entire series
besides Kiyoaki and
Honda, and these char-
acters and their own at-
titudes and actions shed
light on the spectrum of
opinions held towards
the zeitgeist of the series’
setting (1912-1975). For
instance, we can see
how Kiyoaki’s father,
Marquis Matsugae,
initially a preeminent
nobleman in Spring
Snow, goes on to occupy
a much humbler status
in Runaway Horses and
subsequently even loses
his estate, demonstrating
the changing fortunes
of different characters
and reflecting the state
of flux of 20th century
Japan.
Mishima’s own life is
also quite fascinating,
to say the least, and
this translates into his
writing. He was born
into an upper mid-
dle-class family and
had a strong footing in
the samurai ethos. The
setting for first book was
in his own alma mater,
the Peers School, and
Kiyoaki’s proclivities
to ‘beauty’ in existing
are clear references to
his own life. Mishima’s
romantic life was not
so straightforward,
having been temporarily
involved with the current
empress of Japan and
also being reported as
bisexual. His sexuality
was explored in his other
work, Confessions of a
Mask, though his wife
consistently denied this
charge. Within the Sea
of Fertility tetralogy,
elements of his own
romantic experiences
are quite evidently used
in developing the plot of
the first book where Ki-
yoaki’s romantic interest
was betrothed to a prince
in the royal family which
then catalysed his own
passion. As is with such
fiery passions, it even-
tually consumed him,
resulting in his death.
Mishima’s own
thoughts and ideologies
more significantly shape
the narrative of the
second book. Mishima
held strongly national-
istic views and firmly
believed in the divinity
of the Emperor of
Japan. He also felt that
modern developments of
industry had pernicious
effects on Japan.
After submitting
the final chapters of
the entire series to his
publishers, Mishima
proceeded to attempt a
coup d’état to inspire
restoration of power
to the Emperor on the
same day. Ostensibly the
coup failed and Mishima
proceeded to commit
ritual suicide after
giving a speech to troops
in a Japanese military
base that his militant
group had occupied. In
Runaway Horses, Ki-
yoaki’s reincarnate, Isao
Iinuma, also develops a
similarly strong nation-
alistic fervour and plots
to launch a campaign to
‘purify Japan’, failing
which Isao also commits
suicide in a dramatic
fashion. Runaway
Horses was published
in 1969, more than a
year before Mishima’s
own suicide, giving the
impression that Mishima
had foreshadowed his
own death.
The series also
contains a strong phil-
osophical bent, with
Mishima exploring
human nature through
the characters and how
they react to the events
unfolding. Honda for
example was initially
characterised as a highly
logical person, which
manifested itself in his
choice to pursue law.
However, when con-
fronted with Kiyoaki’s
reincarnation, his person
was profoundly altered
and his thought process
was well documented
throughout. Aspects of
Zen Buddhism and the
philosophy of reincar-
nation, among other
complex ideas, are
explored, particularly
in the third book – I
am very excited to get
started on that.
Admittedly, I am
unable to do justice to
the intellectual force of
the series in this short
review but I hope Mishi-
ma’s own words will
speak for themselves:
“If we look on idly,
heaven and earth will
never be joined. To
join heaven and earth,
some decisive deed of
purity is necessary. To
accomplish so resolute
an action, you have to
stake your life, giving
no thought to personal
gain or loss. You have
to turn into a dragon
and stir up a whirlwind,
tear the dark, brooding
clouds asunder and soar
up into the azure-blue
sky.” –Runaway Horses
