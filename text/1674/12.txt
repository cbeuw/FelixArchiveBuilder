T
here is no criti-
cism more widely
levelled against
book and author
than that of difficulty. I
was prompted to write this
article because of a one-
star Goodreads review of
Thomas Pynchon’s The
Crying of Lot 49. It began:
“A classic English
majors only book, aka
people like talking about
this book and that they
‘get it’ make you feel like
their intellectual inferior.”
Readers and non-read-
ers alike may describe
books as dull; some refuse
to approach ‘classics’
since they are dated
whilst others, like our
reviewer, will not touch
modern literature because
it is overcomplicated and
self-congratulating. My
hope is to show that often
these are not bad books but
they instead reveal fault in
our way of reading them.
Each of these descrip-
tions veil a common
criticism: difficulty. To
say a book is dull is to say
that it is harder to absorb
yourself in reading than
in other media. Many old
books are dated. Dickens’
vocabulary is unusual,
his settings Victorian, and
his ghosts are far from
frightening but his stories
resonate today as they did
one hundred and ninety
years ago – A Christmas
Carol was even adapted
into a movie by The
Muppets! So datedness
is not in itself a criticism
but instead hides the fear
that it is too difficult to
distill Dickens’ stories
from his language. Many
modern classics are
overcomplicated. Authors
like Pynchon have written
books that stretch the defi-
nitions of a novel but these
are often books where
difficulty is necessary in
their aims.
There are bad books but
in many cases the difficult
book is not written poorly.
The fault often lies with
us in our approach to
reading these books. For
this I return to my angry
Pynchon review which
ends with:
‘If you enjoy art that
makes a statement, try
this book. If you enjoy
books for the story they
tell and the messages you
can extract from that story,
avoid this book. It’s up to
you.’
Giventhegreatdiversity
of authors and their books,
the greatest determining
factor for our enjoyment is
how well our expectations
match the book we end up
reading. The books I’ve
found most difficult have
not been bad ones but
ones that were not right,
at that time, for me. These
books either challenge our
expectations of writing or
challenge our expectations
of the world.
No one can read Harry
Potter and Oliver Twist
in the same way. To
expect to breeze through
Dickens at the pace you
would read Rowling is to
set yourself up for disap-
pointment. He is not so
hard when you read him,
as originally intended, in
an environment without
other distractions, such as
to pass the time on Sunday
afternoons. The reviewer
above likes to read other
things and writes that
Pynchon is a bad writer
for writing differently.
He may indeed be a bad
writer, but it would not be
because of the difficulties
this reviewer had.
Finally, there are books
that weren’t written for
you: books addressing
issues you do not care
about, have overlooked or
struggles you do not un-
derstand. In One Hundred
Years of Solitude, Gabriel
García Márquez grants us
insight into the Colombian
culture rarely discussed
in the UK. He opens a
door for insight, but that
requires empathy from a
reader too. Books dealing
with issues of oppression,
like institutional racism,
are often written for those
within the community.
Those of us outside the sit-
uation who attempt to read
them should be aware that
these works are not always
written for us. These can
be the most difficult books
to read. A book is not bad
for challenging your base
beliefs, nor for asking
you to empathize with
characters different to
yourself. When read con-
siderately, these books can
be far more enlightening
and memorable than any
‘easy’ novel.
The relationship
between book and reader
is deeply personal and
difficult to deconstruct.
Our fault, as readers, is
in expecting books to
conform to what we want
them to be before opening
them, instead of allowing
them to suggest different
approaches. The perfect
relationship is that of
compromise, where you
allow a book to change
your perspective and
grow from it. Sometimes,
however, as with rela-
tionships between people,
compromise is difficult. It
is important to remember
that often compatibility
isn’t possible even when
the other has few objective
faults. Sometimes, the
timing is just wrong.
In defence of ‘difficult’ books
Is a book ‘bad’ because it is ‘too difficult’ to read? Felix writer Ned Summers thinks the issue is in our approach.
