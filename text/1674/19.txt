When in Rome: a weekend-getaway in the Eternal City
Travel Editor Edita Pileckyte takes us through her guide to a whirlwind tour of Rome

A
mong all the
deadlines and
stress, we de-
serve some time
off, so we can recharge and
stay happy, healthy, and
productive. And travelling
is one of the best ways
to do that, am I right? I
assume you agree since
you’re reading the Travel
section. Well, lucky for us
travellers, it’s possible to
visit most European cities
in just one weekend, since
the distances are relatively
short and flights are af-
fordable. Just earlier last
week, Ryanair released
tickets between the UK
and some European desti-
nations starting from just
£5 one way. The offer was
valid until midnight only,
but Ryanair releases such
deals from time to time, so
it’s possible to score cheap
tickets if you keep an eye
out.
There are plenty of
interesting weekend-trip
destinations, but this
time let’s talk about
Rome – one of the most
fascinating cities I’ve
visited. I went there on
a cold weekend in early
December last year. Well,
it was cold in London,
but Rome welcomed me
with mild Mediterranean
weather and unforgettable
sights. What amazed me
the most were the majestic
remains of ancient
buildings, distributed all
across the modern city and
responsible for its charm.
Impossibly grand, they
were built without any
modern technology and
managed to survive for
centuries.
Since I arrived in Rome
on a Saturday afternoon
and had to leave Sunday
night, I didn’t have much
time to explore the city.
But I was determined
to make the most of it
and committed to a busy
weekend. I wasn’t going
to miss out on anything
– this might be my first
and only time in Rome
for all I know! The very
first place I visited was the
Vatican City – the smallest
country in the world
and home to the Pope. It
boasts St. Peter’s Basilica,
the Sistine Chapel, and
museums with famous
works of art. Since the
place was closed for sight-
seeing on Sunday, I rushed
to see everything on the
short Saturday afternoon
I had left. Unfortunately,
being a still-inexperienced
tourist, I managed to fall
straight into a tourist trap.
It was one of those guided
walking tours, advertised
on the street: I was told
the lines to Vatican are
very long and there was no
way I could see everything
by the closing time. So I
tour wasn’t really worth it
(or at least I was unlucky).
The guide would just
mumble something,
which was impossible
to hear most of the time,
and still didn’t manage to
show us everything in the
museums. So coming in
late and without a guide
might have been the same
experience, only much
cheaper! Regardless, the
Vatican was very pretty
and well worth seeing,
especially if you’re into
art. You can also partici-
pate in Sunday Mass with
the Pope in St. Peter’s
Basilica or Square. The
tickets are free but need
to be collected at the
ticket office in advance.
However, the museums
are closed on Sundays,
except for the last Sunday
of every month, when the
entry is also free.
But my Sunday was
dedicated to sightseeing
in Rome. Coincidentally,
I was there on the first
weekend of the month,
when entry to Coliseum
is free. The queue was
very long but moved quite
swiftly. The Coliseum was
worth the wait anyway,
especially given the free
entry, which also included
entry to the Roman Forum
and Palatine Hill. I also
visited the Museum of the
Risorgimento that offers
a mesmerising panorama
of the city. Since I had
some time left, I walked
the lively streets in the
city centre, and visited the
famous Trevi fountain and
the Pantheon on my way.
However, the visit
“I arrived
in Rome on
Saturday, and
left on Sunday,
so I was
determined
to make the
most of a busy
weekend”
gave in and bought a €40
tour instead, which was
supposed to let me cut the
line and give me enough
time to look around
properly. However, the
variety of delicious pizzas.
It’s more popular amongst
the locals than tourists and
is therefore cheaper. Since
this place was close to the
River Tiber, I completed
my trip by taking a walk
along the river and back to
the Coliseum, which was
beautifully lit up for the
evening.
BEWARE: tourist
traps! I cannot stress this
enough. Street sellers are
very persistent and will
do anything to get your
money. During my visit,
many were pestering the
tourists in the queue to
the Coliseum, offering
the overpriced ‘jump-
the-line’ tickets, when
the entry was free that
day anyway. Though the
tours were real, it’s still a
huge rip-off. But the most
infamous example is the
people aggressively trying
to sell flowers, souvenirs,
toys, and whatnot to
anyone passing by. If you
touch any of that, you’ll
be pressured to pay. Some
might even start a friendly
conversation with you, try
to shake your hand and
slip something in it, and
then demand money. So be
vigilant and stay safe!

on pasta and pizza. I was
