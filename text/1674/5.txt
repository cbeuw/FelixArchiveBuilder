Let’s not politicise the modern pandemic of
mental health
Jenny Eden argues that the rise in mental health problems amongst the young is nothing to do
with politics and everything to do with the way we live our lives

uring the
Labour Party
conference last
month, sixteen
year old Lauren Stocks
delivered a speech on the
state of mental health in
pupils studying for their
GCSE’s. She was bold
and passionate; she stirred
the audience, received a
standing ovation, and later
the video of her speech
went viral. She was cer-
tainly much braver than
me aged sixteen: to stand
up in front hundreds of
people and communicate
her views with such raw
emotion is something that
has to be commended.
However, while her con-
victions are honest, she
missed the point.
She described “seas of
spaced out, stressed out,
depressed kids” where a
“good half, if not more” of
them have a mental illness.
This, she thought, is for
the most part down to the
new GCSE system, with
numbered grades, tougher
material, Ofsted, and of
course – the government.
The Tories are out to ruin
children’s lives for the
many political gains that
will come of doing so. She
made a “call to arms” on
the matter. Sharpen your
pitch forks and burn an
effigy of Theresa May,
that kind of thing.
What she completely
bypassed is that the rise
of mental health problems
(that being a broad
umbrella term for such a
multitude of issues) is a
global phenomenon, not
just for children in formal
education but across
the entire demographic
spectrum. Depression and
anxiety in particular have
seen the sharpest increase
in recorded cases.
According to the World
Health Organisation,
between 1990 and 2013
the number of people
suffering with anxiety or
depression increased from
416 million to 615 million
worldwide. That’s 8.1%
of the world’s population
burdened with one of
these health issues in
2013. No doubt that figure
is higher now, but perhaps
most telling is the fact
that many of the nations
blighted with these par-
ticular illnesses are those
which generally have high
living standards. Those
which should, theoreti-
cally, have the happiest
populations. America is
the ultimate example; the
world’s largest economy,
yet 1 in 5 adults have
mental health condition.
Japan faces suicide rates
of 70 per day. In South
Korea, a country which
has fanatically adopted the
western lifestyle, suicide
is the leading cause of
death for anyone between
the ages of 10 to 30.
European mental illness
accounts for 20% of total
health problems. This,
therefore, is a pandemic
and it is affecting the most
developed, modernised
nations first.
We all have a vague
idea of the causes – social
media, poor diet, 24 hour
news to name a few. In the
case of Lauren Stocks and
her fellow 21st century
classmates, I would argue
it’s the internet, more
specifically social media,
making them miserable.
No one finishes a day
of staring at their phone
with a sense of accom-
plishment. Satisfaction
maybe, but certainly not
happiness.
Stocks blames the
government for her gener-
ation’s unhappiness, when
in fact this is something
far beyond the scope of
current policy. The rise of
social media, social pres-
sures, social anxiety, is
not really Theresa May’s
fault. Yes, more could be
done by her government
to mitigate the damaging
impacts of modern life.
But if there is to be a “call
to arms” against anyone,
surely it would be against
the Silicon Valley giants?
Of course, Silicon
Valley can’t be held re-
sponsible for every case
of depression or anxiety.
Nobody could have antic-
ipated the adverse effects
technology and increased
interconnectivity can have
on a person. Equally, the
governments of devel-
oped countries cannot be
demonised for failing to
grasp the full scale of the
problem. This is a new
global issue which needs
to be tackled by politi-

cians, spanning all parties,
who have a better working
knowledge of modern
mental health.
Ultimately there need
not be political polarisa-
tion over the matter, no
“call to arms” as Stocks
would urge. We need
to be cooperating – not
just from left to right,
but on an international
level – to encourage more
collaborative research into
the detrimental impacts
of the internet and the
vessels through which it
reaches people. We need
to be helping those school
pupils, as described by
Lauren Stocks, to cope in
the online world in which
they have grown up.
Self-help books are absolutely terrible, and
I’ll fight them to the death
Even if self-help books are well-written, and their authors are people with good intentions,
thinking you know the best way I should live my life is offensive

I
n my three years at
Imperial I have had
many opportunities
to be triggered
by Felix’s Comment
section — Brexit, two
general elections, and
numerous terrorist attacks
have produced articles that
managed to properly rustle
my jimmies. The piece in
last week’s issue, howev-
er, extolling the virtues of
self-help books managed
to push me over the edge,
and I felt compelled to
respond.
I must confess that the
only self-help book I have
read from cover to cover
was Bertrand Russell’s
The Conquest of Happi-
ness, arguably the first
of its kind. Like all good
self-help authors, Bertrand
Russell struggled with
depression for most of
his life and decided that,
having overcome it, he
was qualified to tell other
people how to live their
lives. This was the 50’s
so it’s filled with lots of
lovely Freudian bollocks
that naturally passed as
common-sense at the time.
All this is to say that
while I would love to go
on a rant about how all
self-help books are written
by sinister people who
wish to make money from
other people’s misery, I
want to say that calling
these books literature
is misleading, since it
implies that they’re worth
reading, but I have no
doubt that some of them
are well written.
I do however have one
quite justified gripe with
self-help books, and that
is that they imply that
you are not living your
life correctly: ‘are you de-
pressed?’ they ask, ‘well
that’s because you’re not
doing it right, you should
be meditating and trying
to live in the moment.
Read my book and I’ll let
you in on THE secret.’
This annoys me on one
level because I dislike
people who are too sure
of themselves. If someone
tells you they know how
you should be living your
life, they almost certainly
don’t and are, in all likeli-
hood, a terrible person.
But more importantly,
I dislike this because
feeling like I should be
living my life differently
is the number one cause
of me being unhappy.
Whether I feel like I
should be spending more
time with my family,
reading, or doing sports,
the feeling that I should
be doing something inev-
itably makes me sad. Self-
help books feed on this,
creating a vicious cycle of
making you feel bad about
not doing something, and
then selling you the cure to
your unhappiness, which
you inevitably don’t do
because not everyone has
time to go to retreats in
“If someone
tells you they
know how
you should be
living your life,
they almost
certainly don’t”
Tibetan monasteries.
While I doubt the author
was serious about making
self-help books compul-
sory reading at Imperial,
for the reasons outlined I
would fight such a move
to the death if needs be.
Thankfully that won’t
happen, so I can continue
reading Private Eye and
being miserable.

any of these authors. I
wish I could froth with
rage describing the pseu-

that riddles the pages of
these awful books, but I

Phoenix is the arts magazine of Imperial, and we’re looking for Editors! Phoenix is released every term, and
displays the best in student poetry, prose, essay-writing, photography, and visual art. Phoenix Editors would need
to gather contributions, select which will go in the magazine, and lay out the final product. This year, we also
have the Blyth Gallery for 6 weeks, meaning you’d get the chance to curate an exhibition.
If you’re interested, please email a short description of yourself (<250 words), detailing any previous experience,
and any ideas you have for the magazine,
Applications close noon, Friday 10th November
