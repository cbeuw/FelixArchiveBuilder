ost of us
want to make
a difference
and have
a positive impact. Even
the most selfish, mon-
ey-and-status-seeking
student has issues they
care about. However, in
such a complicated world
it’s hard to know where
to start. You may have a
good heart, but without
direction you might end
up donating to the first
charity fundraiser who ap-
proaches you on the street.
While this is definitely
well-intended, it’s not
always the best option, as
some charities can do far
more good than others.
There are clearly other
approaches to channelling
your good intentions, and
currently one of the most
successful ones is effec-
tive altruism. Effective
altruism is a movement
that applies evidence and
reason to look for the best
ways of helping others. In
other words, if altruism is
the idea that you should do
good, effective altruism is
the idea that you should do
as much good as possible,
based on the best informa-
tion available to you.
Effective altruists
consider a variety of things
when trying to achieve this
lofty goal. It seems trivial
to point out, but high-im-
pact causes that make a
bigger difference, all else
being equal, are obviously
preferable. Similarly,
causes in which progress
is easier to achieve are
better than ones where the
same achievements will
take longer and cost more.
In general, causes which
are more neglected may
be better opportunities
to do good, as they will
be further from the point
of reaching diminishing
returns.
A key theme here is that
in order to do the most
good, one must first ask
how much good can be
done “on the margin”, by
adding another donation
or hour of work on top of
what each cause already
receives. This is much
more useful to individuals
deciding what to do with
their own contributions. It
can be easy to assume that
any do-gooding is good
enough, but by taking
the time to consider the
options you can achieve
so much more.
For example, if you care
about improving people’s
health, it’s much easier to
prevent well-understood
widely available.
For these reasons, the
Schistosomiasis Control
Initiative (SCI) here at
Imperial is considered by
many charity evaluators
to be one of the most
cost-effective charities
in the world – 1000s of
times more cost-effective
than the average charity.
They provide deworming
pills donated by pharma-
ceutical manufacturers to
the regions that suffer the
most from this neglected
tropical disease. This
intervention has been the
subject of multiple studies,
and the SCI are committed
to rigorously evaluating its
effectiveness.
That’s not to say that
donating to SCI is definite-
ly the best way to do good:
for example, the Against
Malaria Foundation is also
believed to have cost-ef-
fectiveness in the same
order of magnitude, but
it’s challenging to make
these estimates precise
and reliable enough to tell
which charity is definitive-
ly better.
Both of these char-
ities assume that our
top priority should be
the health and physical
well-being of people alive
today. Perhaps a key dis-
tinction between effective
altruism and other social
movements is that EA
doesn’t dictate the values
you should hold. Instead,
the focus is on helping
you to further your own
values, whatever they may
be.
If you think animal
lives are also worth pre-
serving and improving,
then you may find that
the best way you can do
good is by working to end
factory farming, which
causes suffering on an
industrial scale. Beyond
persuading people to go
vegetarian, one promising
option is to develop better
meat substitutes that can
be produced much more
humanely and outcompete
the farmed equivalent.
On the other hand, if you
think the lives of people in
the future are also worth
considering, in addition
to everyone alive today,
a common conclusion is
that it is very important to
preserve human civilisa-
tion. Depending on your
evaluation of the different
threats and your own
talents, this could involve
working with emerging
technologies in order to
guide their development,
finding a job in gov-
ernment where you can
improve prevention and
responses to pandemics,
or limiting catastrophic
climate change through
policy work.
In order to do the most
good you possibly can,
you must first decide on
your goals. Once you’ve
done that, using scientific
evidence effectively to
inform your decisions can
make a big difference in
how much good you do,
whether it’s by consider-
ing which career paths can
have the most impact, or
by comparing the charities
that attempt to achieve
your goals. The effective
altruism movement can
allow you to save more
lives and help more people
than you could ever have
managed otherwise.

conditions, and much
cheaper to focus on doing
so in the developing world
where cheap medicine and
health care aren’t already
