accused of rape

A
lecture hosted
as part of
Imperial Col-
lege’s charity
week has been post-
poned after the speaker
was accused of rape.
Oxford Professor Tariq
Ramadan was billed to
appear in a talk entitled
‘What could the future
hold for Islam in Europe?’
on Monday, 24th
of
October. However, it was
indefinitely postponed
at the last minute after a
Facebook post emerged
accusing Ramadan of
rape.
Henda Ayari, leader
of the French feminist
campaign group Les
Libératrices, said that
she had remained quiet
after the alleged attack
due to threats against her
more. It’s too heavy to
wear. It’s time for me to
tell the truth.” Two other
women have since come
forward, also accusing
Ramadan of rape and
sexual assault.
The event, run by Impe-
rial College Charity Week
and Imperial College
Islamic Society was part
of a fundraiser on behalf
of the international aid
and development charity
Islamic Relief, which
provides humanitarian
aid around the world. The
Facebook event had at-
tracted the interest of more
than 400 people before it
was removed. The limited
run of tickets went on
sale two weeks before
the event, and before the
accusations surfaced.
Those who managed to
buy tickets online have
been fully refunded, with
the Union apologising for
the inconvenience.
In a statement, a Union
representative told Felix:
“We support the decision
of the Islamic Society to
cancel the event featuring
Tariq Ramadan after these
allegations were made
against him. We will work
with the society as it looks
to offer alternative events
for its members.”
Ayari first reported the
alleged rape in a book but
did not identify Ramadan
as her assailant. She
claimed that Ramadan
assaulted her in his hotel
room in 2012 and “choked
me so hard I thought I
was going to die”. Ayari
further accused Ramadan
of blaming the incident
on her, as Ayari – then an
adherent to the ultra-con-
servative Salafist branch
of Sunni Islam – was not
wearing a veil at the time
of the attack.
Ramadan has dismissed
the accusations as a “cam-
paign of slander clearly
orchestrated by my long-
term adversaries.”
Ramadan’s lawyer,
Yassine Bouzrou, told
BuzzFeedNews: “Mr Tariq
Ramadan categorically
rejects all these false
allegations.” A complaint
for slander and defama-
tion has been filed against
Ayari.
The accusations against
Ramadan have emerged
against the background of
social media.
Ramadan was born in
Geneva, and has been
teaching at Oxford Uni-
versity since 2005. He is
currently the Professor
of Contemporary Islamic
Studies in the Faculty of
Oriental Studies of St. An-
thony’s College, Oxford.
Imperial College
Islamic Society runs the
Imperial component of
Charity Week annually in
the last week of October.
Last year’s campaign
raised more than £1
million. Events this year
included a discussion of
the mental health and
wellbeing of refugees and
a 15km adventure trail,
along with street collec-
tions and black tie dinner.
Neither Imperial
College Charity Week nor
Imperial College Islamic
Society responded to
requests for comment.
Islamic Relief declined to
comment, saying that it
would be “inappropriate”
to do so as it had not or-
ganised the event.
