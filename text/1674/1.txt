T
he President of
the Graduate
Students’ Union
(GSU) is to be
remunerated for under-
taking the role, the Grad-
uate School announced
earlier this week.
The plans, which the
College says were “made
jointly by the Education
Office, the Graduate
School, and the Graduate
Students’ Union”, would
see the GSU President re-
ceiving an annual stipend
of £10,000. The money
would be funded by Im-
perial’s Education Office,
and would not come from
the Union itself. The po-
sition would be part-time,
in contrast to the seven
paid sabbatical positions
the Union offers, which
require students take a
year out. The proposal
was initially put forward
by Ahmed Shamso (the
2016/17 GSU President)
and Luke McCrone (the
incumbent GSU Presi-
dent) with support from
the Union.
The move comes
following concerns about
the impact the role has on
the President’s studies.
In a statement sent out
by the Graduate School,
Shamso spoke of the
difficulties he had faced
as a result of taking on
the GSU President role:
“Spending a large amount
of my time on enriching
the life of postgraduate
students at Imperial has
had a costly effect on the
progression of my PhD re-
search...I will most likely
stay beyond the 3-year
funding window, which
will add extra pressure on
my financial health as an
individual.” He said that
the changes should “help
alleviate these challenges
for future Presidents.”
McCrone, who un-
dertook a full-time paid
sabbatical role last year
as Deputy President (Ed-
ucation), and is currently
doing a PhD, said that the
changes should help create
a “sustainable model for
postgraduate representa-
tion at Imperial”. He told
Felix that the President
is “placed under huge
amounts of pressure, not
only having to lead and
motivate a committee of
elected students, but also
having to deliver the PG
voice and opinion at many
College committees, some
of which are as senior as
Senate.”
He said that it was
“absolutely imperative
that [the GSU President]
is not only incentivised to
carry out their work to a
respectable standard, but
to also have the financial
reassurance that they can
take time out of their PG
programme to fulfil their
role.”
The GSU President
has a range of roles: as
well as coordinating their
committee, the majority
of whom were voted in
last month, the President
should “further student-re-
lated policy and influence
decisions for the benefit
of Imperial College’s
Postgraduate students”,
“ensure that decisions and
achievements of the GSU
are clearly communicated
to the College”, and
“represent the interests of
the Postgraduate students
on decision-making
committees within the
faculties, the College and
Imperial College Union”.
The result is a workload
that occupies around two
full-time days a week.
When asked about how
this would affect compe-
tition for the role in the
future, McCrone said “I
am certain that the position
