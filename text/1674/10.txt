O
ctober has been
full of fantastic
releases: from
synth pop to
hip hop, from indie labels
to industry juggernauts,
from distinguished artists
to new talent. Pay no mind
to anyone who claims
“there is no good music
anymore”. At Felix we un-
fortunately don’t have the
time to review everything
good that comes out,
so curated here are ten
fantastic releases from the
last month that you can
judge for yourself.
Artist: Kelela. Label: Warp.
For Fans Of: Arca; FKA
Twigs; Jessy Lanza. Release
Date: October 6th
. 54 minutes
TAKE ME APART
If you travelled back to
the 90s and told a Warp fan
that their favourite label
would be releasing R&B
they’d laugh you back
to the present. Although,
after one listen of Take
Me Apart it’s obvious the
album is a perfect fit for
the IDM powerhouse.
Kelela’s voice cuts
through a rumble of drum
machines and sub-bass to
carry messages about sex,
love, and the difficulties
they create. Take Me Apart
is a classic in the making.
Artist: Kaitlyn Aurelia
Smith. Label: Western Vinyl.
For Fans Of: Suzanne Ciani;
Animal Collective; Holly
Herndon. Release Date:
October 6th
. 51 minutes
THE KID
Do you like analog
synths?The correct answer
is yes, and on her latest
release composer Kaitlyn
Aurelia Smith proves
they’re not just instru-
ments for chin-stroking ac-
ademics. The accessibility
of The Kid is impressive,
particularly when Smith’s
weapon of choice remains
her Buchla synthesiser.
The machine’s organic
textures are melded into
a psychedelic pop-opera
tracing out a cycle of birth,
life and death, all in the
space of less than an hour.
Artist: Lil’ Pump. Label:
Tha Lights Global/Warner
Bros. For Fans Of: Lil’
Yachty; Lil’ Uzi Vert; Chief
Keef. Release Date: October
6th
. 36 minutes
LIL’PUMP
Mumble/Cloud/Sound-
cloud rap may have a
reputation for trashy bars
and rushed beats… but
that doesn’t necessarily
mean it’s bad. Lil’ Pump
is crammed with guilty
pleasures. Gucci Gang
contains the lyric “My
lean costs more than your
rent”. What more do you
need to know?
Artist: Ziúr. Label: Planet
Mu/Objects Ltd. For Fans
Of: Ellen Allien; Ash
Koosha; Steffi. Release
Date: October 6th
. 41 minutes
U FEEL
ANYTHING?
Techno tends to stick
to repetitive kick drums
for a reason. Having a
rigid skeleton means
you can experiment with
texture until your ears
bleed, but you’re always
going to find someone
willing to dance to it. Ziúr
throws this mantra out the
window, instead opting
for cascades of sampled
crashes, hisses and
scratches. Guest vocalists
sometimes coast atop this
to add to the chaos, com-
pleting a release certain to
shake-up the Berlin scene.
Artist: King Krule. Label:
True Panther/XL. For Fans
Of: The Pop Group; PJ
Harvey; Fela Kuti. Release
Date: October 13th
. 66
minutes
THE OOZ
Archy Marshall
(a.k.a. King Krule, a.k.a.
Zookid, a.k.a. Edgar the
Beatmaker, a.k.a. DJ JD
Sport, a.k.a. The Return of
Pimp Shrimp) is a unique
voice in contemporary
UK music. Raised in
Peckham, his tales of woe
in life and love are trans-
lated through the sounds
of punk, jazz, hip-hop,
blues, and afrobeat. The
OOZ further broadens this
scope of influences, but
still sounds greater than
the sum of its influences.
Few artists can carve out
a unique sound nowadays,
but Marshall has proved
himself capable of this
time and time again.

Artist: Floating Points.
Label: Pluto. For Fans Of:
Four Tet; Caribou; James
Holden. Release Date:
October 19th
. 19 minutes
RATIO (12”)
In 2015 Floating Points
released Alaenia, a metic-
ulously engineered mas-
terpiece divorced from
time. Ratio sees him take
the experimentalism he’s
focused on from Alaenia
onwards, honing it into
a spectacular club opus.
The expansive 19 minute
single carves out a middle
ground between his earlier
dusty house tracks and
his more recent jazz-fu-
sion experimentations.
Analogue synths wobble
over a pulsing beat. The
track constantly leaps
forwards, anxious to reach
the next bar. A fantastic
piece to round off any
great night-out.
Artist: Invisible Church
& Marie Davidson. Label:
Yerevan Tapes. For Fans
Of: Umfang; Karen Gwyer;
Wolfgang Voigt. Release
Date: October 20th
. 19
minutes
WHATEVER MAKES
YOU FEEL SAFE (EP)
Quebec native Marie
Davidson takes a turn
away from her starker
EBM-revivalism on this
collaborative release
with Invisible Church.
Crisp drums and synths
are replaced with liquid
electronics and crackling
percussion. Synths swell
to give the impression
of drowning. Davidson’s
vocals haunt the tracks,
often being elongated
or reversed, creating an
ambient techno sound too
unsettling to be relaxing.
Artist: Lee Gamble. Label:
Hyperdub. For Fans Of:
Burial; Actress; Special
Request. Release Date:
October 26th
. 43 minutes
MNESTIC
PRESSURE
Despite a disappointing
live set (reviewed in last
week’s edition), Lee
Gamble has put together
a fantastic album, tying
together over 30 years of
the UK underground. The
music flutters between
a variety of bass-driven
styles. Dark ambient melts
into dub techno which
accelerates into jungle. All
of these elements are glued
together by Gamble’s
peculiar approach to
texture, increasing the
accessibility of his album
without damaging its
experimentalism. ‘Ghost’,
with its masterful chops,
may stand as one of the
greatest jungle tracks
released in the last decade.
Artist: John Maus. Label:
Ribbon Music. For Fans Of:
Ariel Pink; Molly Nilsson;
Tonstartssbandht. Release
Date: October 27th
. 38
minutes
SCREEN
MEMORIES
Six years on from
his last album, John
Maus has built his own
modular synthesiser
and completed a PhD in
political philosophy. Both
of these advances serve
as a bedrock for Screen
Memories. Maus’ music
often sounds like in-uni-
verse pop music from a
trashy 80s cyberpunk TV
serial. But he deftly uses
this minimalist new-wave
sound to provide a
retro-futuristic protest
against our own dystopian
shade of hypercapitalism.
Because is our reality
really that different from
80s science-fiction at this
point?
Artist: Fever Ray. Label:
Rabid Records. For Fans
Of: Alice Glass; Björk;
Röyksopp. Release Date:
October 27th
. 47 minutes
PLUNGE
Karin Dreijer’s has
dominated the sounds of
21st century pop simply by
being herself. Her twisted
electropop compositions,
both as brother-sister duo
The Knife and as solo act
Fever Ray, have made pop
weird again. Plunge serves
as just another bullet point
on an already impeccable
CV. Moving away from
the themes of isolationism
and motherhood of her
self-titled debut, Fever
Ray’s sophomore release
is an exclaimed worship
of all things kinky. Sex,
flesh and leather are or-
chestrated as pitch-shifted
layers of vocals, frantic ar-
peggiators, and bombastic
percussion. Lyrics about
the mundanities of life are
replaced with expressions
of carnal desire which
Dreijer somehow makes
sound deeply moving. If
there’s one album from
this year worth hearing,
Plunge is undoubtedly it.
