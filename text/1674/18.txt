MINDHUNTER
SEASON 1
M
indhunter is
a gritty 10
part Netflix
crime drama
set in 1977, based on
John E. Douglas and
Mark Olshaker’s book of
the same name. Listing
Charlize Theron and
David Fincher among
its producers, the show
takes tips from both stars’
previous work, most
notably the camera work
and atmosphere, which
were perfect in Fincher’s
Zodiac. Jonathan Groff
plays Holden Ford, an FBI
agent who is motivated to
understand why it is that
criminals act the way they
do, and the motivations of
serial killers in particular.
This leads to Ford joining
up with the behavioural
sciences solo unit at the
FBI, run by Bill Tench
(Holt McCallany). Agents
Ford and Tench want
to expand the unit from
being just “profiling road
school” to a scientific in-
quiry of what causes these
random killings. There is
constant internal scrutiny
from the FBI about the
worth of this unit from
their boss, Shepard (Cotter
Smith).The series then fol-
lows these characters try
to learn why ‘spree killers’
exist, and to understand
the psychology of their ac-
tions by interviewing them
in prison. Subsequently,
the team expands, with the
unit hiring Wendy (Anna
Torv), a Boston University
social sciences professor,
and further characters ap-
pearing later in the series.
There is an over-arching
plot at the beginning of
every episode showing
an unknown serial
killer (well, unknown to
to do well is the intense,
intimate interview scenes
with the serial killers the
agents are studying. Most
notably, the recurring
character and real-life
killer, Edmund Kemper,
portrayed brilliantly
by Cameron Britton.
Britton’s portrayal of the
sociopathic killer is well
executed and probably the
stand out performance of
the series, with the effects
of his visceral explana-
tions of his crimes causing
psychological damage to
the agents investigating
him throughout the series.
This is not to mention the
striking resemblance that
Britton holds to the man,
proving that casting is a
crucial element of a good
biopic.
Tench is a highly mas-
culinised agent, visiting
local police departments
to teach them techniques,
but mainly socialising
and having a laid-back
approach to the job.
However, we see that
these interviews detailing
the heinous crimes have a
large psychological toll on
his character, leading his
family life to be strained,
and even causing him
to take a break from the
interviews. The idea that
this seemingly granite
plot device allowing us to
see how Groff’s character
changes from an upstand-
ing member of the agency
to somebody who has
gotten in too deep with the
psyche of the serial killer.
However, this is clunkily
implemented into the
show and it sometimes felt
that these scenes were just
jammed in as time fillers.
This is perhaps because
the viewer just sees her as
Ford’s student girlfriend
rather than a complex
character of her own.
The show approaches
its setting and time period
quite well, giving an au-
thentic feel of a time when
there was much hostility
towards the FBI in the
USA. It also shows how
the agency wanted to shed
its image of ‘Hoover’s
boys’ to a world leading
highly successful special
police force. It deals with
the stigma of homosexu-
ality within government
agencies at the time
through Wendy’s charac-
ter as she is led to live a
double life at home and at
work. A lot of the scenes
exhibit the film-making
techniques perfected by
Fincher in this genre in
Seven and Zodiac, but at
no point do they feel like
a stale rehash of these
works. The offices scenes,
cold and dimly lit, are
what Fincher does best,
and Mindhunter is no
different.
Mindhunter’s first
season promises to set
in motion an interesting
crime drama, which has
great potential to go on
to be one of Fincher’s
classics. However, some
of the episodes were stale
and focused too much on
FBI bureaucracy rather
than focusing on what
is obviously the show’s
strongest asset: the thrill-
ing interview scenes with
psycho-killers.

On the other hand,
Holden Ford seems to take
an emotionless approach
to the grisly world he has
thrown himself into. He
is reminiscent of a film
noir detective, working
his way through crimes
coolly and calmly whilst
he leads these interviews.
Yet he seems to slowly
pick up the characteristics
of these characters and
incorporates them into his
own personality which
