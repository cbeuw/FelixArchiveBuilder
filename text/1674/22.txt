Student Action for Refugees
Imagination, enthu-
siasm, and happiness
are at the heart of Bake
Soc. We are a friendly,
social society welcoming
students of all abilities
– from those who have
never used the oven to
those who are ready to
enter the Great British
Bake Off! We host fort-
nightly, themed potlucks
where you can meet new
people, share recipes, and
eat an assortment of tasty
treats, as well as monthly
outings to bakeries around
London. There will also
be exciting workshops
from gelato production to
cookie chaos!
We always welcome
ideas from members so
whether you want to go
to a chocolate factory or
go on a bakery crawl, just
speak to us and we’ll see
what we can whip up!
Imperial College
Gospel Choir is an en-
ergetic and fun-loving
family. We are a non-audi-
tioned choir and no formal
singing experience is nec-
essary. All we ask is that
you bring your passion
and enthusiasm – we can
help with the rest. We
are also looking for band
members, so if you play
an instrument and want to
accompany a choir, we’d
love to have you.
Rehearsals are on
Monday evenings from
18:30 – 20:30 (venue
included in weekly emails)

and you are free to join

have our own Christmas
concert in December and
perform at other Christ-
mas concerts inside and
outside of Imperial. Later
in the year, we take part
in the annual University
Gospel Choir of the Year
competition, have our
Easter concert, and also
perform at culture society
shows. So, if you are keen
to challenge yourself and
perform, you are welcome,
but if you just want the
community and to build up
your confidence singing,
you are also welcome.
You can email gospel.
choir@imperial.ac.uk to
join our mailing list or if
you have any questions.
You can also like our

DANCE IMPERIAL
WORKSHOP
WEEKEND
Dance Imperial’s (DI)
Workshop Weekend is
back. This year EIGHT
different societies have
come together to provide
you with a weekend full of
amazing classes.
In addition to normal
classes taught by Imperial
students, we’re lucky
enough to have profes-
sional instructors for
Beginners Belly Dance,
K-Pop, Charleston, and
West Coast Swing. This
is a great chance to attend
professionally taught
classes at a bargain price.
Come to as many
classes as you like, you
can drop in and out, go to
your regular classes and
try out new styles.
Plus if all that dancing
wasn’t enough, on the
Saturday we have a social
with FREE PIZZA from
8pm and drinks at the
union after that. You must
have attended at least one
class to be eligible for
the free food, but with
the classes being such
good value for money
it is definitely worth it!
And last but not least,
‘Creative, Spontaneous
Baking’ (CSB) is also
encouraged – ever thought
of just making up your
own recipe from scratch?
130g flour or 200g? 4
eggs or 5? Now’s the
time to experiment! The
best original recipes by
members of the club will
be featured in the official
Bake Soc recipe book at
the end of the year. Join
us and get baking! And if
you have any questions,
feel free to contact us at
baking-society@imperial.
ac.uk !
More information for the
social can be found on the
event page (https://goo.gl/

Classes can be bought
online in advance from the
Union website as well as
