Luca Guadagnino serves us up a shimmering slice of
young desire
Hotly-tipped for success at this year’s Academy Awards, Call Me byYour Name is a heady tour-de-force of love and
passion in the north of Italy.
FILM
F
rom Maggie
Cheung slipping
out onto the Hong
Kong streets in
her cheongsam, looking
for some noodles to eat
in In the Mood for Love,
to the sparks illuminating
the faces of the Danish
ascetics in Babette’s Feast
as they are served the meal
of a lifetime, cinema and
food have always been
a powerful combination.
Food can serve as a pro-
cess of mourning, as it
does for Rooney Mara’s
character in A Ghost
Story, who devours a pie
in its entirety following
the death of her husband
before throwing it back
up; it can be a source of in-
dependence and strength,
as it is for Penélope Cruz’s
character in Almodóvar’s
Volver; and it can also be
a source of sexual tension,
as anyone who saw Adèle
Exarchopoulos in Blue is
the Warmest Colour can
attest. As Fellini report-
edly said: “Never trust a
woman who doesn’t like
to eat. She is probably
lousy in bed.”
Luca Guadagnino is
a filmmaker well versed
in the erotic qualities of
food and eating: his 2009
breakthrough I am Love
begins with an elaborate
dinner being prepared
at the house of Emma
Recchi, a Russian emigre
to Milan who has married
into a wealthy industrial
family. The film then takes
us through a technicolour
whirlwind of delicate
dishes, which serve both
as drivers of the plot and
as conveyors of sensuality,
as Emma begins an affair
with a chef, Antonio.
Food took on lesser but
still central role in his
follow-up, A Bigger
Splash, where Guadagni-
no swapped out the bustle
of the city for sun-baked
island of Pantelleria,
located between Sicily
and Tunisia. However,
A Bigger Splash, which
took its inspiration from
Jacques Deray’s thriller La
Piscine, was a dry piece
of filmmaking, as flat and
sun-baked as its island
setting.
“As in
Guadagnino’s
previous work,
food takes on a
starring role”
In comparison, Call
Me by Your Name, which
is based on the novel by
André Aciman and forms
the final instalment of
Guadagnino’s ‘Desire’
trilogy, is near-obscene
in its fecund vibrancy.
Taking as its setting a
sumptuous villa in the
northern Italian country-
side during an early-80s
summer, Call Me by Your
Name tells of the growing
attraction between Elio
(Timothée Chalamet), a
precocious 17-year-old
with a talent for music, and
Oliver (Armie Hammer),
a graduate student in his
mid-20s, who comes to the
villa to assist Elio’s father
Lyle (Michael Stuhlbarg)
in research.
Food again takes on a
starring role, standing in
for thwarted desires and
tempestuous attraction,
taking on a fetishistic-like
quality: soft-boiled eggs
spray bright orange yolk
across starched tablecloths
whilst mounds of ripe
apricots pile up in bowls,
to say nothing of a certain
scene involving a peach,
which set the internet
chattering last month.
Music also plays a key
element in Call Me by
Your Name, as it did in
his last two films: John
Adams returns, evoking
the marriage between his
minimalist bombast and
Guadagnino’s well-tem-
pered camera that caused
great effect in I Am Love,
but the soundtrack on the
whole is softer, and more
piano-led. Sufjan Stevens
contributes with an alter-
native take on his haunting
track Futile Devices,
adding to the affective
atmosphere.
Hammer continues the
indie run he has enjoyed
with Free Fire and Noc-
turnal Animals, delivering
a performance that is
brimming with confidence
and energy, yet conceals
hidden depths. Even more
engaging, however, is
Chalamet’s turn in the
film; his Elio is sensitive
and vulnerable, tentatively
caught between adoles-
cence and adulthood. Cha-
lamet’s features perfectly
resemble those of Greek
statuary, but any concerns
that he might have been
chosen for his looks rather
than his skill are quickly
dashedaway,ashedelivers
an emotionally-rich
performance. Both have
been tipped for Academy
Award success later in
the year, and for good
reason. The supporting
cast is small, but Michael
Stuhlbarg is captivating as
Elio’s father, delivering an
emotive speech at the end
of the film that forms the
heart of the two-hour-long
work.
In a number of ways,
Call Me By Your Name,
with its sun-dappled,
northern Italian location,
and its air of insouciance
and endless days, brings
to mind Vittorio de Sica’s
The Garden of the Fin-
zi-Continis, adapted from
Giorgio Bassani’s 1962
novel. While Call Me by
Your Name doesn’t have
the ominous threat of
Fascism in the background
– which draws shadows
across the life of the
Jewish family in de Sica’s
film – there are similar
themes centring around
the loss of innocence:
Guadagnino has spoken of
the decision to transpose
the events of the original
novel from 1987 to 1983,
a year in which he argues
“the ’70s are killed, when
everything that was great
about the ’70s is definitely
shut down.” And thus
the summer of Call Me
by Your Name must also
inevitably come to an end,
with a winter scene at
the end of the film that is
astonishing in its intensity.
With Call Me by Your
Name, Guadagnino
returns to the northern
Italian climate where his
inspiration grows best. It’s
a coming-of-age tale that
avoids all the trite cliches
found in other films; an ad-
aptation of a much-loved
book that has managed to
retain all the wonder that
made Guadagnino one to
watch when he released I
Am Love. It’s a postcard
from an eternal summer,
the kind that you only
miss once it’s gone – rich
and heady and full of raw
emotion.

CALL ME BY YOUR
NAME
An exercise in unremitting tension and horror
Yorgos Lanthimos returns with The Killing of a Sacred Deer, which cements his reputation as a master of unease
FILM
I
t seems that for Greek
director Yorgos
Lanthimos, who
directed Dogtooth
and The Alps before
making his move into
English-language cinema
with 2015’s The Lobster,
the term ‘clinical’ may
be a compliment. Since
his breakout feature
back in 2009, Lanthimos
has ploughed the same
furrow, excelling in cold,
flat affect and a unique-
ly-awkward dialogue he
creates with writer and
frequent collaborator
Efthymis Filippou. It may
be described as detached,
cerebral, or, perhaps,
‘clinical’. In The Killing of
a Sacred Deer, Lanthimos
picks up this descriptor
and runs with it, opening
the film with a direct shot
into the chest cavity of
a man undergoing open
heart surgery; his ribs are
cracked open, jacked apart
with a retractor, revealing
a grotesquely pumping
heart, almost obscene in
its perpetual motion. The
whole scene, in classic
Lanthimos fashion, is
soundtracked to Schubert.
The bloody gowns
and gloves are removed,
revealing Colin Farrell,
in a spotless button-down
and fancy watch. But this
is not the warm Farrell
of Winter’s Tale, nor the
gruff and grizzled Farrell
of The Beguiled or In
Bruges, oh no. This is the
quietly rational Farrell of
The Lobster, a figure who
only comes out under the
watchful eye of Lanthi-
mos’camera. He is playing
Steven, a cardiac surgeon,
who lives in a beautiful
detached house with his
ophthalmologist wife
Anna (Nicole Kidman),
and their two children,
Kim (Raffy Cassidy) and
Bob (Sunny Suljic).
However, things are
not all right in paradise,
and soon Martin (Barry
Keoghan) comes onto
the scene – a strange and
delivers a horrifying piece
of news to him: either he
must kill one of his family
members, or they will all
begin to wither away and
die before his very eyes.
The choice is his.
Kidman, who has for
a number of years been
perfecting an exacting,
glacial persona (which
she has the skill to turn
off at any minute – see her
performance in last year’s
Lion for proof), comes
into her own in the role
of Anna. Lanthimos pulls
off a similar trick to what
he achieved with Rachel
Weisz in The Lobster,
limiting an actor’s emo-
tional palette so they must
go deep rather than broad.
Keoghan is similarly
affecting, delivering a per-
formance with an uncanny
sense of otherness and
naturalism: he is here to
disrupt simply because
that is in his nature.
While Dogtooth
and The Lobster were
broadly comedies – jet-
black comedies with a
nerve-wrenching intensity
that set the teeth on edge
perhaps, but comedies
none the less – The Killing
of a Sacred Deer veers
much closer to horror.
There may be comedic
elements, most notably in
Filippou’s script, but at its
heart the film is an exercise
in relentless tension and
body horror. This intensity
is aided and abetted by the
soundtrack, built heavily
around the haunting works
of Russian composer Sofia
Gubaidulina, which are
reliant on shrieking strings
and ratcheting stabs of
accordions.
In The Killing of a
Sacred Deer, Lanthimos
is drawing on a deeper
and darker wellspring
of inspiration than ever
before. The title refers to
the Greek tragedy of King
Agamemnon, who – upon
killing a deer and angering
the goddess Artemis –
must kill his daughter if he
wants his ships to sail to
Troy. Lanthimos is telling
on the role of Artemis,
in reality he is more akin
to the Greek chorus,
commenting on the action
without influencing it.
Steven may believe that
bluster and brute force
may allow his family to
escape their curse, but in
reality there is only one
solution: an inescapable
ethical decision whose
endpoint is a bullet, lodged
in the sternum of a family
member.
In many ways, The
Killing of a Sacred Deer
reminds me of Jonathan
Glazer’s Under the Skin,
not only for the similari-
ties in the score – although
Gubaidulina’s work is far
more intense – but in the
way both films reflect
human behaviour back at
the audience, in a way that
causes a profound discom-
fort. In Lanthimos’ work,
the dialogue appears like
a paranoiac’s imitation of
human speech; it’s like a
funhouse mirror project-
ing back a simulacrum of
language.
If Greek drama can
teach us anything, it is
that violence rarely means
the end of the story: in
The Oresteia, Aeschylus’
retelling of the story of
Iphigenia, Agamemnon’s
actions result in his death
at the hands of his wife
Clytemnestra, who is
killed in turn by their son
Orestes. While Lanthimos
does not end the film with
more overt violence, it
is clear that the events of
the film will exact a form
of psychic pain upon the
family. Similar feelings
will be evoked in the
audience. The Killing
of a Sacred Deer is not
an enjoyable watch, but
in the most interesting
and – paradoxically – en-
joyable way. It does what
all great horror films do,
and delivers a shock, one
akin to being left in an
icy bath: while the initial
chill might fade, the cold
remains in the marrow,
deep inside the viewer.

“Kidman, who

off-putting teenager, who
crashes down on the family
like a giant, menacing
cuckoo. He is intimately
linked to Steven, and
“The tension
is aided and
abetted by the
soundtrack,
which draws
heavily on the
work of Sofia
Gubaidulina”
a tale as old as human
civilization, of outcomes
predestined to occur, of
inescapable fated to which
characters are drawn with
a steady inevitability.
Like many protagonists
of Classical drama, Steven
is a man blinded by
cowardice and a sense of
self-importance, refusing
to tell his wife about the
terrifying prophecy until
both his children are made
bed-bound. While some
