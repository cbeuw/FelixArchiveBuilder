Existential Dread Society event evacuated after
overcrowding

C
ampus security
had to be called
to the Union
Dining Hall
last night, after a huge
number of people at-
tended Existential Dread
Society’s first event of
the term.
The event, a lecture
from Dr Michael Chalet,
Professor of Continental
Philosophy at UCL,
entitled “Why your life has
no meaning, and nobody
will really remember your
name”, proved so popular
that precautions had to be
taken to prevent injuries.
Eye-witnesses report
that around 500 students
turned up to the event,
resulting in overcrowding;
two students required
medical assistance after
overheating and/or having
an existential crisis.
We spoke to Timothée
Lyons, Chair of Existential
Dread Soc, who thought
the large attendance was
a reflection of mounting
pressures this term: “We
didn’t have a massive
amount of interest during
Freshers’ Fair – people
looked at our name
and presumed we were
just another consulting
company. However, as
people are beginning to
get snowed under with lab
reports and coursework,
it’s understandable that so
many people would want
to hear an hour-long ex-
planation of why nothing
we do ever really matters.”
One attendant Felix
spoke to said that the
lecture had inspired her
to change her working
habits: “before I was
taking everything very
seriously,” she said, “but
now I’ve been reading
lots of Heidegger, and
I’ve realised: my degree is
only part of the everyday
chatter, the gerede, which
keeps me from being able
to see the void that exists
at the centre of life. So
I’ve stopped going to lec-
tures. I’m now much more
content about my insig-
nificance in the universe,
which puts the 2:2s I’m
getting into perspective.”
A fresher who spoke
to us said, “I bought my
membership in the first
week because I thought it
sounded cool, but I didn’t
really get it. Now that I’ve
handed in my first lab
report though, I can see the
endless abyss stretching
out before me, extending
to the horizon.”
Existential Dread Soc
was formed early last
academic year, and has
spent the past 12 months
in the Union’s New Ac-
tivities Incubator – Lyons
described the wait to be an
independent club as “an
excruciating torment of
nothingness.”
The society are capi-
talising on this renewed
interest by reaching out
to other student societies
across campus: DramSoc
have already started
rehearsals on a season
of Sartre and Beckett,
while Fashion and Design
Society have begun work
on a capsule collection
inspired by Simone de
Beauvoir’s headwear.
Noteveryonewashappy
with the society’s success,
however: we spoke to one
member of Union Council,
who was deeply distressed
by the events. “Everyone
is putting forward papers
about how democracy
is a shallow facade, de-
signed to hide the futile
scratching at life’s surface
we all engage in on a
daily basis,” he said, “but
nobody will take the time
to review my update to the
Mascotry Policy.”
Existential Dread
Society will be running a
‘Kierkegaardians on tour’
trip to Denmark early next
year. Activities include
discussions about what
pain can teach us, medi-
ations on the meaning of
angst, and paddle-boating.
“As people are
beginning to
get snowed
under with lab
reports, they
want to hear
an hour-long
explaination
of why nothing
we do matters”

This week you are
a Constituent Union
mascot, and you just
want to be left in peace
to slowly rust in a corner.
Please.
This week the barista
in the library cafe shows
off his latte art skills and
draws you a little love
heart. Enjoy it, it’s as
close to intimacy as you’ll
get.
This week you are the
horoscope writer, and
a joke made last week
about the library cafe
closing leads to countless
panicked emails. You
revel in your power.
This week you attempt
to use what you’ve picked
up in the first month of
a chemistry degree to
make your own fireworks.
You’re only slightly
singed, but it’ll take a
while for your eyebrows
to grow back.
This week interest rates
go up, so you phone your
friend in the Business
School to explain what
this means for prices in
SAF Café. Big mistake,
you can’t get them to shut
up.
This week you hear
everyone talking excitedly
about a new hack-space in
White City. You wonder
why they changed the
venue of Union Council.
This week you hear
about the plans to pay the
GSU President, and try to
make your own claim for
remuneration, citing ‘an
invaluable contribution to
student life’. The Union
tell you your meme pages
don’t count.
This week you decide
to relive your fresher
experience and move back
into halls. The student
hub lose your application,
so you spend a week
sleeping in the library.
Still a better commute
than Woodward.
This week you find
out that your Constituent
Union mascot is a giant
thermometer, and you feel
deeply, deeply ashamed.
This week you hear
about the Alumni Visitor
Centre, and how you can
get free Rubicon, but then
you find out you don’t
count as an alumnus if
you were kicked out.
This week you decide
to start taking divestment
seriously, beginning by
not turning up for your
9am lectures. These
buses aren’t good for the
environment, ya’know.
This week you’re
a multinational
organisation, and you
get upset that an article
a student paper has
published might hurt your
reputation. Don’t worry,
we already all think
you’re evil.

College to cut down on hours of sunlight at campus
HANGMAN
With lab reports and
deadlines looming,
students are turning to
the void for emotional
support.

E
arlier this week,
Imperial College
a n n o u n c e d
w i d e - r a n g i n g
changes to their Campus
Sunlight policy, which
will come into play at the
end of this month.
As well as ending
British Summer Time,
which reset the clocks to
Greenwich Mean Time
last Sunday, a number of
changes are being made to
sunlight hours and micro-
climates across Imperial
campuses. Sunlight
Services – the branch of
College that deals with
artificially manipulating
the weather – reported
that Imperial has finished
construction on its sun-
disk: a large circular solar
panel, measuring 1.2 km
in diameter, which will
perpetually hover above
the South Kensington
campus.
As a result of the sun-
disk, the College will
be cutting the available
sunlight hours down to
three: sunlight will
be available between
10-11am and 2-4pm each
day. In a statement ac-
companying details of the
changes, the College made
it clear that “since our in-
ception, Imperial has not
made any direct money
out of the sun, so we are
excited for this new devel-
opment.” They also stated
that the new solar panel
would “provide all the
energy needed to power
our world-class research,
while also allowing us to
divest from fossil fuels.”
Felix spoke to Harry
Thibault, Vice Provost
(Cloud-Seeding and
Sunshine), who explained
that the reduction in
daylight hours would
be a benefit to students:
“numerous studies have
found that students will
innately seek warmth and
comfort. By reducing both
the levels of sunlight and
the temperature across
campus, students will be
driven by instinct towards
the warmest place on
campus: Imperial Central
Library, which will be
floodlit at all times. We
predict that these changes
will result in a sharp
improvement in exam
results.”
The Deputy President
(Welfare) will be distrib-
uting vitamin D tablets
to all Constituent Union
Presidents later this week,
to avoid another outbreak
of rickets across campus.
