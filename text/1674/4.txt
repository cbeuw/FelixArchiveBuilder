The Balfour Declaration: a century on
100 years ago this week, the British government signed away land that was not theirs to pass
on with the Balfour Declaration. The result of this poorly-worded document, which did not help
Palestinians, nor those fleeing anti-Semitism? A century of conflict and misery.

W
hen people
hear about
P a l e s t i n e
and Israel,
they usually know ‘some-
thing’s going on there’ but
few seem to understand
what exactly is happening,
and most importantly how
the conflict originated.
There are many factors,
but it is widely agreed
that the Palestinian-Israeli
conflict can be traced back
to the Balfour Declaration,
which was signed 100
years ago this week. And
so, with a century passing
since the beginning of a
long and tragically painful
conflict, it might be about
time to actually take a
step back and understand
the repercussions of this
three-paragraph long doc-
ument and what it meant
for world history and
settler colonialism.
‘So what exactly is the
Balfour declaration?’ you
may be asking yourself.
Well, it is quite literally
a page-long document
signed by the British
Foreign Secretary at the
time, Sir Arthur Balfour,
in which he states that his
government “expresses
sympathy with Jewish
Zionist aspirations” and
“view with favour the
establishment in Palestine
of a national home for the
Jewish people”, essential-
ly signing off the land of
Palestine to Jewish people
fleeing anti-Semitism and
persecution in Europe,
despite Britain not owning
this land in the first place.
This was vital to the
Zionist cause, which aims
to establish a safe, Jewish
homeland. And although
it is true that Zionism is a
method through which the
Jewish people may escape
anti-Semitism, it does not
take into account the fact
that their homeland of
choice was already inhab-
ited by the Palestinians,
and thus would require
extensive ethnic cleansing
were it to become a solely
Jewish state.
However, even when
they were giving away a
land that was not theirs to
give in the first place, the
British government was
still vague and inconclu-
sive even in doing that:
they also stated “nothing
shall be done which may
prejudice the civil and
religious rights of existing
non-Jewish communities
in Palestine”. By taking
this document, and thus
establishes precedent for
both involved parties to
argue that they are the
ones that the imperialistic
power is supporting.
Despite the lack of
awareness with which this
situation was handled, this
declaration was not merely
a careless mistake made
by the British government.
Supporting the Zionist
cause and allowing the
occupation of Palestine
(and hence the develop-
ment of an apartheid state
in the Middle East that
economically and politi-
cally depended on Britain)
allowed them to maintain
control the area, without
being called an imperial-
istic state – officially, they
were no longer colonising
Palestine themselves. It
was the perfect method,
not only for Britain but
for Europe too, to avoid
making any effort to fight
the ongoing anti-Semitism
that dated back to the
1400s and beyond – from
the Spanish inquisition
and persecution of
Sephardic Jews, going
through the infamous
Russian pogroms, and
finally reaching breaking
point after the Holocaust.
Jewish people have
been through years of
“Yeah, it’s time
for a big pull-
quote. We love
these things,
but don’t
forget to make
them short!”
unjust persecution, and
it is because of this that
the Zionist ideology
blossomed. However,
this persecution does not
justify the Israeli gov-
ernment’s occupation of
Palestine, and the result-
ing ethnic cleansing and
human rights violations
that have been reported
by the United Nations, as
well as by Humans Right
Watch. We let down both
Palestinians and Jewish
people fleeing persecution
by failing to address the
issue of anti-Semitism,
and by partitioning Pales-
tine in such an unaware
manner. A century later,
we have failed to carry

of conflict, it’s

step back, and

a look at the population
distribution in Palestine,
we can see that, even up
until 1945, the Jewish
population was clearly
a minority, so the real
question is: how did
Britain intend to support
those who wished for the
ethnic cleansing of indig-
enous Palestinians, whilst
also ensuring the Pales-
tinians’ civil and human
rights were not com-
promised, and that they
were protected? Britain
managed to support two
conflicting and mutually
exclusive movements in
“We let
down both
Palestinians
and the Jewish
people fleeing
persecution
by failing to
address anti-
Semitism, and
by partitioning
Palestine in
such a manner”

and the conflict remains in
a painful status quo. How
many more anniversaries
will pass before we take
action?
