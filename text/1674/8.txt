CÉZANNE PORTRAITS
T
o be honest,
I’ve never really
understood the
greatness of
Cézanne. Another big
male artist, but with an
Impressionist style not as
fairy-like as Monet and a
technique not as cubistic
as Picasso. An in between
– someone who never
really dedicated himself to
any specific style.
Without any expecta-
tions to have my mind
changed I enter the
National Portrait Gallery
and the first thing I can’t
help but notice is the
grandness of the museum.
I find my way to the
exhibition and walk in.
Crisp white walls, high
arches, and staff walking
around in black uniforms,
making sure that no one
takes a photograph nor
touches the art. The halls
are not only filled with art,
they are also filled with
people. People of all ages,
of different styles and na-
tionalities. It did not take
long for me to realize that
it’s not just any exhibition
I’m entering – rather, it’s
an exhibition of one of the
biggest artists of the 19th
century.
We walk through
Cézanne’s life and artistic
development. We meet
more and less important
people in his life through
his portraits, people who
have been there for longer
and for shorter periods of
time. Most importantly,
we meet an ever changing
Cézanne – from rough
portraits in earthy colors
to paintings full of play-
fulness. The exhibition
starts off with some of his
earlier works, paintings
that are characterized by
fast strokes made with a
palette knife. The tech-
nique that he developed
during this phase of his life
is often referred to as one
of the major contributing
factors to the Expressionist
movement, characterized
by magnified emotional
expressions, often com-
municated through colors
and shapes. At first glance
the paintings feel pretty
brown and colorless, but
as you step closer to the
frame a palette full of color
starts to reveal itself. Blue,
green, and yellow, all
perfectly clear and distinct
at a near distance but
from afar creating a unity.
There is something wild in
this way of painting; the
movements of the knife
are easily distinguished
and create a storm of dull
colors.
The color palette in-
tensifies as we continue
our tour to the next
room. Portraits in bright
turquoise, pink, and red
show a distinct change in
flamboyant. The palette
knife phase is over, but
the geometrical shapes
that he used to create with
them live on as blocks of
color. The playfulness and
beauty in this part of the
exhibition can easily be
appreciated, even by those
dragged here by their
grandmothers.
Cézanne’s later years
were filled with hardships,
as reflected in the last
room, where portraits in
dark colors and self-por-
traits of an elderly, gloomy
version of his old self
all contribute to a more
obscure atmosphere.
Cézanne did not want
to flatter people in his
portraits, and he refused
to paint anyone who
expected an improved
version of themselves. The
people in his portraits are
not exceptionally beautiful
or interesting to look at.
Beneath the technique and
colours they are normal
people portrayed as their
true selves. The wish to
create a realistic inter-
pretation of his models
becomes clear in the por-
traits of Hortense Fiquet,
more commonly known as
Madame Cézanne. Several
canvases are dedicated
to her quite grumpy face.
She is not being painted
as a muse, not idolized or
embellished. We can see
Cézanne’s objectivity in
these portraits as they lack
any tendency of facial
expressions or emotions.
This objectivity follows
through in all of his work:
unlike his colors and
technique the faces remain
plain. Cézanne is known
for his still life paintings,
and the way he has chosen
to portray his models is
more like how you would
portray a bowl of fruit
rather than a human being.
Instead of focusing on the
face, the emphasis is on
the details around: a pipe,
hat, or a not-fully-painted
skirt are all details that
attract the eye – the details
that make the audience
search and look around for
more.
I have always believed
that Cézanne’s work is
just plain and boring. This
has been proved wrong.
After visiting the National
Portrait Gallery I have
come to realize that he is
much more than an in-be-
tween: he paved the way
for the Cubist movement
with his graphic and
geometrical technique,
inspired Expressionism
with his palette knife
phase, and is still consid-
ered an Impressionist. But
there is also a curiosity, a
playfulness, and a desire
to keep trying new things
in all of his paintings. It is
the small details, the half
painted skirt, the pipe,
and the hat, that reveal the
curious artist in search of
expression.

style. The intense colors
are weighed down by
more gentle brush strokes
than seen before. It creates
a more impressionistic
feeling which is not only
by chance: during this
period of his life Cézanne
encountered several soon-
to-be famous Impres-
sionist painters such as
Pissarro and Monet. Their
influence on Cézanne’s
work is clear, with the
brush strokes and colors
going from earthy and
harsh to light, graphic, and
