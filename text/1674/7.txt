The darker side of human data
What are the implications of a near future in which humans will be rated on their behaviour and relationships?

n 2014, the State
Council of China
announced the devel-
opment of a digital
‘citizen rating system’ to
determine each citizen,
company, and local
government’s “trustwor-
thiness”, with the intent of
building social trust and
crushing China’s rampant
counterfeiting and fraud
issues.
To Westerners it may
sound like an Orwellian
dystopia. For the Chinese,
however, it is soon to be a
reality, and participation
will be compulsory by
2020. The idea is already
being implemented by
eight private Chinese
companies, one of whom
is the financial wing of
Alibaba, China’s largest
online shopping platform.
Although the form of
the government system
is uncertain, cues can
be taken from Alibaba’s
system, Sesame Credit
(SC). Users are given
a score based on five
factors: credit history, ful-
filment capacity, personal
information, behaviour
and preferences, and in-
terpersonal relationships.
The first three may sound
familiar: they are similar
to a credit score, and are
based on financial infor-
mation and basic personal
details.
The last two are factors
currently unaccounted
for in western big data
systems. They indicate
that what you – or your
friends – buy online or say
on social media can and
will affect your “trustwor-
thiness rating”.
SC scores do not take
content into account:
using Alibaba’s services,
or having friends who
use SC, will increase
your score, but what is
actually bought or said has
no effect. It resembles a
loyalty scheme more than
a social credit system.
The implication, however,
is that it could consider
these factors, and that the
governmental system will.
Data is drawn from
a variety of sources:
China’s corporate giants
are worlds apart from their
western counterparts. SC
alone draws information
from all of Alibaba’s
branches, from shopping
to taxi services to Alipay,
China’s ubiquitous online
payment platform. Alipay
is used for everything
from bills to bus tickets,
and so Sesame Credit
always knows where you
are and what you buy. Big
data is simply a fact of
Chinese life.
The government has
access to all of this infor-
mation, atop of that from
“Your personal
score will
have tangible
consequences
in reality”
“The
technological
limitations of
such a system
are important”
other mega-corporations,
due to the Chinese gov-
ernment’s long-standing
history of demanding
users’ personal data from
private companies.
Your personal score will
have tangible consequenc-
es in reality. Those with
high SC scores can book
hotels without a deposit,
or even get fast-tracked
for visas. The future
government system would
even incorporate punish-
ment: a 2016 document
says that low scores could
result in ineligibility for
certain jobs, lower internet
speeds, and barring from
certain restaurants.
China already severely
punishes dissenters: 6.3
million people who defied
court orders are on a public
blacklist, banning them
from buying plane or train
tickets and limiting the
purchase of luxury goods.
Internet access or social
media accounts are often
suspended for expressing
dissent.
Amplified by their
big-data rating system,
the potential for absolute
totalitarian control is real.
Technological tampering
is also a threat: if the
security of the system is
ever breached, the damage
caused by hackers could
ruin lives.
Despite this, the system
is being welcomed by
many Chinese citizens.
Chinalacksthewidespread
credit score systems that
are well-established else-
where, making it difficult
to obtain loans. Fraud and
counterfeiting are daily
grievances. The Chinese
are sick of the absence of
reliability in their society.
Furthermore, there are
those that argue that the
new system offers more
governmental transparen-
cy. China rewards loyal
citizens, too: hundreds of
thousands of honours and
titles are given every year,
along with other benefits.
However, the criteria
for these are arbitrarily
decided by officials: at
on friends or family, and
the fact that any dissenter
will drag down the scores
of those around them en-
courages ditching ‘risky’
friendships.
The issue with the
second is that a human can
apply context to a situa-
tion, whereas an algorithm
cannot. Under China’s
automatic digital rating
system, missing a bill
due to being in hospital
and missing a bill due to
unreliability are counted
as exactly the same.
The technological lim-
itations of such a system
are important. Black
market score manipula-
tion, by buying different
personal details, or the use
of VPNs for undetected
online activity, would
tamper with the data. The
data and analysis on which
one’s score is based could
be flawed: nobody knows
whether the suggested
system is really feasible.
The fact that the
originally caused by the
government’s intolerance
of any external institution
that might enforce ac-
countability.
Rather than allow for in-
dependent watchdogs and
increased transparency,
they instead opt for greater
control. As put by Foreign
Policy, the government
is “ensuring that the only
monitor will, once and
forever, be itself.”

“Amplified by
their big-data
rating system,

control is real”
least a rating system
would rely on a suppos-
edly-predictable algorithm
with defined criteria.
Both points have their
counterarguments. For
the first, the new system
undermines trust in other
ways – there will be
rewards for informing

to try regardless is telling.

to consider as remedies for
social mistrust, an issue
