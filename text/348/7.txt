THE SPORTING LIFE FENCING HITS
O m i s s i o n of any report
last week should not be
taken as being d u e to
any w i s h to hide our
week-early arrival for a
race at Parliament H i l l ,
nor a s evidence of any
lack of atheltic recrea-
tion on t h e W e d n e s d a y ,
when w e went to G u i l d -
ford (after a sprint
a c r o s s Hungerford
Bridge) for t h e Stag Hill
Relay in Which w e didn't
do t o o w e l l but managed
to beat L S E B (and sev-
eral people h a d their
photos taken, s o it
wasn't a complete loss).
On turning up (for the
second time) for U L ' s
race against Oxford a n d
B i r m i n g h a m several of
our more experienced
members were caused to
wonder at the complete
absence of a l l our enthu-
siastic freshers. Friday's
all-nighter, a Rugby
match a n d the fact that
it w a s a U L match were
suggested explanations.
Those w h o dared the
cold to race for U L over
five miles of light m u d
were somewhat few: Rob
A l l i n s o n recorded a
spectacular 2 8 m 5 5 (his
best ever at Parly H i l l ) ,
and w a s 5th (!) scorer
for U L , Neil Boag w a s
49th i n 3 0 m 5 7 , a n d
J . S. Kaliray, Steve W e b b
and Dave Jones were
59th, 6 3 r d a n d 70th res-
pectively. Other runners
declined the opportunity
to risk loss of life, or
even worse, by removing
their tracksuits a n d i n -
stead went for a jolly jog
over Hampstead Heath.
A visit to Greasy J o e ' s
Tea a n d Chess M e n a g -
erie w a s followed b y a
fruitless search for a
dhippy (as in fish-and-
chippy) a n d , though a
pub w a s entered (looking
for food), no alcoholic
beverage w a s c o n s u m e d
till m u c h later.
Do not despair, noble
Feelsick readers! Your
literary genius has once
again taken pen to paper
to bring y o u a w i n k s re
port. After following our
adventures last year, no
doubt you have all been
eagerly awaiting the first
instalment of this year's
serial.
After weeks of hard
training and serious prac-
tice w e challenged a
team at Folkestone to a
match. Praying that w e ' d
have no breakdowns due
to faulty water pumps
we set forth for the sea-
side o n S u n d a y 18th.
W e practised our squop-
ping a n d potting a n d
CROSS-COUNTRY
If only Dave had
brought h i s camera on
W e d n e s d a y , then Felix
might have been graced
with pictures of some
dozen athletes man-
handling one of those
R C C minibuses. A cer-
tain flatness of battery
having forced us to push
the v a n to get it going
in Southside car park,
its running out of petrol
some 5 0 0 yards later
came as rather a blow
and m u c h (actual)
swearing a n d (meta-
phoric) k i c k i n g of said
van resulted. N o w , many
other clubs w o u l d have
given up at this point;
not so the Rapid Ramb-
lers. W i t h Steve (X-coun-
try's version of J a c k i e
Stewart) steering a n d
nearly (Neil a n d Kaliray'
were flaking) everyone
else pushing a n d m a k i n g
noises like car engines
we soon arrived at a
garage on the Brimpton
Road about a mile away.
(The days of many of
the inhabitants of this
area were considerably
cheered by this spec-
tacle.)
Those w h o went to
St. M a r y ' s by train were
not entirely free from in-
The start—note the large field
WINKS
were soon confident that
w e c o u l d produce our
usual display (later,
later). The match w a s
g o o d a n d enjoyable but
w h e n w e were seen to
be doing too w e l l , tac-
tics were employed a n d
once again w e w e r e glor-
ious in defeat, by 1 4 ^
pts. to 4 8 ^ . W e celebra-
ted with sandwiches a n d
black coffee (no milk, no
beer, no h e a t i n g — w e ' l l
not go there again in a
hurry) a n d challenged
them to a game of darts.
Our skill with the arrows
was evident right from
the start a n d they
thrashed u s . (Well, w h o
can hope to w i n with
Helen in the team?)
K n o w i n g that, once
again w e had carried
forth the name of Im-
perial College (what
does that say on your
t e e - s h i r t — R o y a l S c h o o l
of . . . M i n e s ? ? ? ) to the
far reaches of the earth,
we returned in splendour
cidents: t h e s m a s h i n g of
Rob's third bottle of
horse liniment in three
weeks w a s achieved by
a well placed shot with
the H o n . Football from
Pete J o h n s o n . T h e actual
race (a league race) took
place over the usual
Bushy Park c o u r s e —
flat, long, fast a n d tir-
ing. Despite this, a n d
having to push vans
about, w e finished three
teams, the fourth one
having s u c c u m b e d to
chemistry practical re-
ports a n d the like. Rob

first back at 27th fol-
lowed by Kaliray (37),

M a k i n g up the third team
were Dave J o n e s , M i k e

Pete J o h n s o n a n d P a d
Donnelly. P a d w a s mak-
ing sure no-one got lost.
Ian Ellis h a d a cold

In this race our first
team maintained its pos-
ition of 6th in division 1,
while our s e c o n d a n d
third teams moved from
7th to 6th a n d from 14th
to 12th in division 2.
The fourth team dropped
from 19th to 2 1 s t but is
not yet last (lots of unfit
runners required!).
After a slight incident

The start of the n e w
season sees the fencing
club maintaining its u n -
broken record of suc-
cess. The first match w a s
against Leyton F . C . w h o
were defeated 7-2 des-
pite putting out their
London League side. The
I.C. team consisted of
three members w h o
helped in setting -up
I.C.'s unbroken first team
record last season,
namely Steve T h o m p s o n
(3 w i n s ) , Julian Tyson
(3 wins) a n d Lawrence
B o y d (1 w i n ) . The team
was particularly pleased
to see a number of n e w
members supporting us
during the match. Every-
one retired to Southside
Bar to round off a very
enjoyable evening.
This demonstrates the
success of the Friday
evening training session
(in the gym!) introduced
this year both for advan-
ced fencers a n d begin-
ners.
On the same evening
we also had a m e n ' s sec-
ond foil team match
away against Ealing
Technical College 1st
T o m A b s o l o m a n d
Richard Annett defeated
a more experienced side
6-3. R i c h a r d d i d parti
cularly well to w i n a l l
three of his fights in h i s
first match for the c o l -
lege.
The club has also h a d
successes in individual
competitions. Notably
Roman Gomez, w h o w a s
runner-up, out of a n
entry of about 6 0 , in the
Sandhurst Open Sabre
Tournament to the cur-
rent W o r l d Professional
Sabre C h a m p i o n . W e are
hopeful that the club will
keep up the standard of
this result during the
rest of the year.
On the social side, the
annual dinner this year
is to be held on T
h u r s -
day, 6th December, a n d
it i s hoped that as many
people as possible w i l l
come.
A s always new m e m -
bers, m e n a n d especially

GOLFING
Free Coaches & Free Beer
M a t c h report for 2 1 s t
November
On Tuesday, shortly
before B i g B e n tolled
midnight, the society
held an 'extraordinary
general meeting' in order
to plan the defeat of
Barts Hospital, a hospi-
tal so steeped in golfing
traditions that even the
bed-pans are fitted with
all-weather grips. Our
determination to w i n w a s
absolute since the cap-
tain of this notorious
team w a s none other
than J i m Foster, known
to the I.C. captain as
' B i g Brother'.
The problem of team
selection w a s unusually
tricky due to the pecu-
liarities of the opposi-
tion. J u l e s D a n ( H o n .
Sec.) said it all (ns
usual!) when he pointed
out that fielding our
strongest s i d e including
famous names like Bill
C a I d e r w o o d , Rich
B r o w n , G i v e Pemberton
or even our developing
star Rich W a d d i l o v e
w o u l d not necessarily be
a g o o d idea. After a l !
Barts h a d a reputation
for w i n n i n g matches in
dubious style. W e had
heard rumours that their
team used comments
like ' D i d you know that
you demonstrate all the
exterior symptoms of
tertiary l e u k a e m i a ? ' or
' Y o u ' v e got a bogey
hanging out of your nose'
just before their oppo-
nent's putt, not the sort
of behaviour that en-
dears them to the oppo-
sition.
A l l this a d d e d up to
the t e a m needing to be
made up of 'Iron M e n ' .
With this decided ob-
vious selections were
' B . M . W . ' B e v S m i t h a n d
Jules D a n , m e n whose
'talk' credentials were
impeccable (in J u l e s '
case his golfing ability
is totally eclipsed by this
other talent). M a n y of
our usual stars appeared
jaded on account of
their previous exertions
and w e r e declared ' u n -
fit' b y society trainer
Noel W i l l i a m s . Thus the
final line-up became —
Nigel Foster (capt.),
Jules Dan, A d r i a n Evans,
Bev Smith a n d M i k e
Marks.
It w a s this planning
that laid the seeds for
the sweeping victory
awaiting.
The first hurdle to
overcome w a s the lun-
cheon, traditionally a
Barts stronghold. J u l e s
completely stole the
show by describing luc-
idly every one of the 11 5
shots he took to get
round the course on the
previous W e d n e s d a y .
W h i l s t J u l e s was deliver-
ing his monologue,
A d r i a n Evans slipped the
opposition a few sardine
s a n d w i c h e s , Bev posed
in front of his n e w
B . M . W . , a n d one of the
opposition fell ill a n d
went home.
After this the match
was a formality, Jules
talked h i s w a y to a
mighty 3 a n d 1 victory.
Bev, playing well w i t h i n
himself halved; M i k e
M a r k s , silencing ' B i g
Brother' with some m a m -
moth putts cruised home
a 2 a n d 1 victor, Nigel
Foster, having heard
rumours that he might
not be playing up to first
team standard, silenced
his critics with a 6 a n d
5 victory. O u r only de-
feat w a s that of A d r i a n
Evans w h o never really
recovered from his Y o g a
class of the previous
night. The margin of b i s
defeat escapes me.
Thus a victory w a s
gained by 4-j- - 1^, a vic-
tory for planning cool-
headedness, a n d J u l e s .
