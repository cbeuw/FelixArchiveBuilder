TOM PAXTON
AT RAINBOW THEATRE SUNDAY NOVEMBER
KOMOUTEK/
T o m Paxton sang and
p l a y e d his o w n compo-
sitions to a relaxed, en-
thusiastic full house.
6 0 p standing tickets only
were available at 8 p.m.
W o r d s a n d melodies,
w h i c h though familiar to
most, are still refreshing
to hear 'live'. He was ac-
c o m p a n i e d by two other
guitarists w h o blended

T o m ' s nostalgic clas-
sics: 'The last thing on

Boy', ' M y lad's a w i l d

audience a chance to

After a break of a

The article in Felix,
November 13th about
the room at the top had
a number of factual er-
rors, mainly due to the
fact that it was not fully
corrected before inser-
tion. The main error con-
cerned the travel facili-
ties. The National U n i o n
of Students' Travel Ser-
vice operates from the
room and has done so
for some time. The bur-
eau is manned (woman-
ned actually) between
the hours of 10.30 and
15.30. The N U S T S oro-
vide the full range of
services: short trips
within Britain to long
haul flights to Australia
and everything in bet-
ween. The bureau is
also the place to collect
your N U S / I S I C from.
For this you need a pass-
port size photograph and
your registration card.
The N U S / I S I C is an ex
tremely useful and valu-
able object as it is your
passport to the numer-
Deliberately, t h e
w o r d s 'concert' or 'per-
formance' are avoided.
T o m Paxton shares his
o w n creative talent a n d
life interpretations—live
or recorded — with his
audiences.
Backstage, at a small
reception in the bar, al-
though T o m was yary
tired, he was still eager
to see his admirers wait-
ing at the stage door to
talk and sign autographs
at 10.15 p.m. I met him
for a personal interview.
Friendly, naturally m o d -
est in attitude, but not
reserved, he carefully
considered the points
raised. Effectively, he
feels students should not
relax their questioning
involvement regarding
important controversial
issues of the establish-
ment: " D o n ' t quit giving
the devils h e l l " . A l -
though he has got off his
soap-box he has never
stopped caring. Fame
and success necessarily
on tours parts him b o m
his family — one aspect
he does regret. The Isle
of W i g h t proved such a
success for T o m that it
seems he c o u l d have
strived to become a
super star but with more
disadvantages.
One of his future am-
bitions is to scriptwrite
a serious play. Singing
and song writing are his
work, striving to do
'more and better', and
at home he enjoys strum-
ming a guitar in the kit-
chen, w h i c h , naturally,
has often been the
source of good material.
He stressed that he aiso
likes listening to m u s i c ,
ous discounts offered to
students by a large n u m -
ber of firms and organi-
sations throughout Brit-
ain and the rest of the
w o r l d .
I a m hoping to restock
the room with some up
to date careers literature.
Few people at present
seem to book the room
for the more sober
events, meetings, talks,
etc.
State of emergency
During the present
State of Emergency there
is a strong possibility
that there may be power
cuts, oil supply cuts, etc.
If you require informa-
tion on the possibility of
power cuts on any parti-
cular day then phone int.

recorded message.
Insurance
I have recently been
in touch with the college
about the policy that has
been taken out on the
students' behalf. I have
been informed that it
may be available (or at
least a draft of what it
contains) some time dur-
ing the next week. If

including C h o p i n , S i m o n
and Garfunkel, Dave Van
Ronk. Although he does
not consider himself a
'poet' laughingly saying
he w o u l d not compare
the lyrics of his songs
with the writings of
someone like Ezra
Pound, one cannot help
admiring his way of ex-
pressing strong attitudes
and finer feelings. He is
very m u c h a family man;
when his second daugh-
ter realised that her
mother and sister each
had song dedications,
she a s k e d why she did
not have one — so he
quickly obliged her! The
favourite of his own
compositions is still his
first: 'The M a r v e l l o u s
T o y ' recognised i m m e d -
iately as a winner by
M i l t O k u n .
This is the second
time I have met Torn
Paxton (previously in
Watford, May 1971)
with Dave Horowitz bare-
foot at the piano. It has
been said a n d written
before but I reaffirm that
T o m Paxton is T o m Pax-
ton on or off stage.
M y thanks are offered
to:
T o m Paxton for granting
me the interview;

rangements;

The ' C h i l d r e n of G o d '
are a most extraordinary
product of m i d d l e class
A m e r i c a n confusion.
F o u n d usually in tubes
or East End streets, dres-
sed i n miscellaneous
curtain remnants, they
hawk their orange or yel-
low handouts to gullible
commuters at 5p a copy
(N.B. 5p " S u g g e s t e d
D o n a t i o n " ) .
Sidling up to you pre-
ferring their publication,
they say in a slow A m e r i -
can drawl as you pre-
tend to ignore them:
C o m ' o n , take a look —
it'll change your life.
The only effective coun-
ter to such an inspiring
debut is total silence and
a minute examination of
the fingernails.
Their literature, I can
reveal, after many tedi-
ous hours of study can
only change ones life
from normal happy-go-
lucky studentness into
abject boredom as you
thumb through paragraph
after paragraph of scata-
logieal inferences laced
A s most final year
students are aware there
are four standard books
containing information
on firms likely to recruit
graduates:
(1) The Directory of
opportunities for G r a d u -
ates.
(2) Graduate oppor-
tunities.
with a biblical quotation
or two.
I must confess that
the only pamphlets that
have c o m e into my pos-
session are other peoples
rejects, found on the
tube and the like. Bought
perhaps by people
searching for a way to
fiddle the tax returns or
maybe because the Stan-
dard's headline looked
too boring to part with
3p, even for the cross-
w o r d .
The latest copy I re-
ceived was the special
edition a d d i t i o n — ' M o v e
on Kohoutek'. Y o u know,
it's that comet that will
illumine our evenings
over Christmas. A n d
you've guessed it —
could it mark the sec-
ond c o m i n g ? W e l l they
aren't sure what events
will occur as " t h e fruits
of this heavenly rape of
her earthly b o d y ! " but
the front cover depicts
cities crumbling, vol-
canoes erupting and a
tidal wave engulfing S a n
Francisco, as Kohoutek
passes overhead.
(3) Career choice,
(4) C R A C : Careers
beyond a degree.
The Appointments
Board is concerned
about the large overlap
between these publica-
tions, and it is interested
to have the opinions of
as large a number of
students as possible on
The back page cata-
logues their publications
and spicy titles they
have too: there's "I
gotta split (Part II)" and
" D r o p o u t s I V " (what-
ever happens to I, II and
III?), who c o u l d miss
reading " T h e Art of
O h ! " ? and no-one could
afford not to have " R e v -
olutionary L o v e - m a k i n g "
in their hands for those
opportune moments
when Paul Jowitt is not
on patrol. But perhaps
the title w h i c h really
captures the essence and
heart of the C h i l d r e n of
G o d movement is No.
264: "I am a toilet".
Yes, well, it got me w o n -
dering too!
I suppose that when
the kids got bored with
the Guru, that podgy
messiah -in - a - Rolls -
Royce, something else
had to c o m e on the
scene to stop them from
attempting to solve their
concrete, material prob-
lems by concrete, mater-
ial means.
It's just another con,
that's a l l .
their relative merits.
If any student has a
preference for all or uny
of the books, or even a
dislike of the publica-
tions, I w o u l d be most
grateful if he or she
could write to me, care
of the U n i o n stating
their reasons.
