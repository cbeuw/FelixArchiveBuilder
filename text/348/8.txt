l.C. 1st X V travelled to Harrow to
play Bedford College in the first round
of the Gutteridge C u p last W e d n e s -
day. A n easy game w a s expected a n d
l.C. were quite d i s m a y e d to find them-
selves 6-4 down after about 1 0
minutes. However the l . C . forward
power began to tell. Indeed one could
say the " m u s c l e w a s paying off."
Only three s c r u m m a g e balls were lost
In spite of Dave Osborne's insistence
on playing in the backs a n d to this
was a d d e d a constant supply of line-
out a n d loose ball. T h e l . C . backs
were also far superior: even " M u s -
s t a r d " Cotter went in for a try. M a n y
good individual a n d team tries were
scored, the best of the latter being a
push over try in the last minute of the
game. In a l l l . C . managed to amass
60 points to Bedford's 4 . T h e team
w a s : I. Partridge (2 tries), D . Shake-
shaft (2 tries), M . Cotter (1 t r y ) , D .
Osborne (2 tries), R. Stern, D. H e n -
ton, R. Huges (2 tries), C . Flanagan
(2 tries), B. Bradley, G . Hughes, C . H .
Wrigley, K. Lipscombe, C . Lewis, A .
Walton, A . W a l t o n , R. Cresswell (1
try).

To the left is a rather
old photograph of a
typical Gutteridge C u p
winning team. However
for many of you this will
give y o u your first
(though not last I hope)
look at M i k e , the n o w
dispossessed mascot of
Imperial College U n i o n .
M i k e , not only being a
mascot, w a s in fact a
highly accurate scienti-
fic instrument. H i s con-
struction w a s very m u c h
a joint effort: cast in
M i n e s , m a c h i n e d in
G u i l d s a n d calibrated by
R.C.S. M i k e , however,
w a s taken from h i s rest-
ing place at the U n i o n
and is n o w currently in
the custody of Queen
M a r y College w h o keep
it w e l l h i d d e n away.
Mascotry is rather rife
this year a n d already l.C.
has had three visits. T h e
only successful one to
date h a s been that of
City University w h o
easily lifted Spanner off
a very m u c h red-faced
G u i l d s . G u i l d s were also
visited by Brunei Univer-
sity w h o removed (illeg-
ally) some shields, like-
w i s e Imperial College
Union Whose Honour
Boards were stolen by
U . C . W i l l l . C . show the
renewed vigour these
other colleges have

M a y b e its just a n
anti climax after seeing
the w o r l d ' s best band
(just a n opinion) at the
Rainbow earlier this
week give a n outstand-
ing performance, maybe
not, but I w a s disap-
pointed that I didn't e n -
joy Back Door as m u c h
as I'd hoped for. A d m i t -
tedly their brand of
m u s i c (jazz) isn't t h e
easiest to get into for
most people, a n d is usu-
ally left for the specialist
but I do pride myself in
being able to enjoy most
types of m u s i c thrown at
me.
They are a three-
piece, tightly-knit, band,
and in the hour or s o
that they were o n stage
they went through about
a dozen or s o shortish
numbers, one after the
other, no messing, play-
ing several from their
newly-released first a l -
bum " 8 t h Street N i t e s " .
C 0 I i n Hodgekinson
leads them, playing the
Fender bass unlike any-
one else I've ever heard,
using it more a s a lead
guitar, a n d sang, when
he d i d , with funk. R o n
A s p e y attacked o n the
saxes, though he d i d a
very nice subtle one on
flute and also played the
keyboard when he h a d a
hand free, a n d finally
Tony H i c k s thrashed the
drums.
I didn't quite catch
the name of the support
band though o n t h e
Whole I didn't find their
m e l o d i c folk very stimu-
lating, although they
s h o w e d versatility in
that each of them c o u l d
play several different
instruments.

FOOTBALL
• T h e 1st XI away to
Kings I is usually one of
the hardest matches of
the season (having not
w o n there for n. years)
turned out to be a good
scrap with l . C . having
the edge a n d running
out 2 — 1 winners. Kings
scored first with the IC
team a little unsettled
but IC hit back about 1 0
minutes later through
some good work on the
wing by B o b (will I ever
get away from l.C.) D a y
and M a u r i c e Hastings
finishing off, giving the
keeper no chance.
The l . C . midfield be-
gan to get o n top a n d
soon Kings were getting
into trouble at the back.
A star " t h i g h t a c k l i n g "
performance by Steve
Bates, and cool accurate
play by John Kelly a n d
Dave Sanderson left the
Kings midfield in be-
wilderment.
Then, completely with
the run of play with l . C .
forwards threatening to
score, one of the K i n g ' s
defenders put the best
lob of the game over h i s
own keeper, although
l.C. w o u l d have put it in
if the fullback h a d miss-
ed. F r o m then o n l . C .
played the ball about un-
til half-time—the worst
thing that could have
happened, for i n t h e
second half l.C. stopped
and Kings came back
into the game but push-
ing too far upfield l . C .
had innumerable break-
aways only to see the
final pass go astray.
From then on l . C . held
their o w n a n d finished
deserved winners. Spe-
cial mention must be
made of t h e defence
who have been c o m -
pletely sound throughout
this season.
The 2 n d XI after a
rather surprising defeat
by the 3 r d XI struck
their usual form by
beating Kings II 3 — 1
Bill Pike (2) a n d C o l i n
H i g h a m (1) scoring for
l.C.
A mention must also
be made about M i n e s ,
who try hard but always
seem to lose, w h o were
on the receiving end of a
6 — 1 thrashing by l . C .
4th — but I a m assured
they played rubbish
(quote from T . - T i b b o t )
the 5th a n d 6th lost I'm
afraid, b u t y o u can't
have everything can you.
