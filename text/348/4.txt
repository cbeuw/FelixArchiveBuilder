Above, M o r p h y day
and here the president of
N u t " Screws W a s h e r and
Bolts gives the president
of Tunnelco a friendly
pre-match snarl with the
favour being amply re-
turned. To the right is
Coanerges about to de-
part on his yearly excur-
sion to Brighton. Greeted
on Sunday morning by
herds of deve*e~s in py-
jamas the ensuing brisk
run was a c c o m p l i s h e d in
fine time despite having
to stop to Change a brok-
en valve (rout'ne). In all
Bo finished fifth. B e l o w
is the R.C.S. answer to
the firemen's strike, their
mascot sporting its new
livery after rebuilding.
Despite rock hard Avo-
cado Pears the rechrist-
ening dinner was a suc-
cess and this venerable
veteran had the privilege
of being driven round the
college by Stirling M o s s
and was apparently none
the worse for wear.
L4DIES ROWING
A t their debut on
M o r p h y Day, the ladies
of l.C. proved their
prowess at rowing after
only a very short prac-
tice half an hour before
the race. They stunned
their male counterparts
in l.C. boatclub and since
then, every W e d n e s d a y
and Saturday, ladies
from l . C . have struggled
out to Putney and taken
to the water. They are
competing in their first
regatta on Saturday,
December 1st in the U.L.
W o m e n ' s Boat Club
Winter I V s .
The original oars-
w o m e n are hoping to
form a permanent club
so that they will be able
to participate in more
events, and attempt to
equal the achievements
of the (long-established)
and successful men's
club.
R o w i n g is very good
fun and believe it or not,
not all that s t r e n u o u s —
if we can do it, anyone
can. (I wonder w h y
they've all given u p
s m o k i n g — E d ) .
