Students from 6 0 0

the government's failure
to provide fair grants on
November 14th. A c t i o n
taken varied from sit-ins
and occupations, to
catering and lecture boy-

These reports, taken
from a reliable Athens
English Language news-
paper are indications of
the problems n o w faced
by the military junta
w h i c h seized power in
1 9 6 7 . A s student leaders
in Athens point out, the
present demonstrations
take place against a
background of increasing
opposition to the junta
throughout the year; op-
position in w h i c h stu-
dents have played an im-
portant role.
The students' c a m -
paign moved early this
year over demands for
free elections in student
unions, to end the Junta
appointing its o w n
agents as union officials.
Students d e m a n d e d the
repeal of a decree that
empowered the army to
draft student activists.
The campaign rapidly
spread to all universities,
involving students in
massive demonstrations
and occupations. In
Athens the lecture a n d
exam boycott lasted
three months and demon-
strations reached propor-
tions of 4 0 , 0 0 0 . The re-
sponse of the govern-
ment was the systema-
tic conscription of
militants, the use of
police violence, of the
para-military fascist or-
marriage to £35,000 a
year, whereas a female
student's grant drops
dramatically on marriage
to £295 a year. Queen

also used the w e d d i n g to
make a point about stu-
dents grants. At Q M C

Thus the student de-

an amnesty for political

for the Junta.
The opposition from
other sections of the
Greek people that fol-
lowed in the wake of the
students' campaign led
to an amnesty and the
declaration of the so-
called 'Parliamentary De-

The National U n i o n of
Students is to set up a
research unit to find out
about the problems of
disabled students and to
suggest possible ways of
dealing with them. The
unit will be expected to
s h o w up the difficulties
in s t u d y i n g experienced
by students with all
kinds of disablements,
including blindness,
deafness and paralysis.
It w i l l also be expected
to s h o w what proportion
of the student popula-
tion is disabled and c o m -
pare this w i t h the pro-
portion of the popula-
tion as a w h o l e w h i c h is
disabled. N . U . S . Deputy
President Stuart Paul ex-
plained:
"It is extremely likely
that there are many
people w h o w i s h to take
a higher education

otherwise perfectly well
qualified to take it, but
have p h y s i c a l disabilities

M r . Paul appealed to-
day to disabled students
to contact N . U . S . if they
have encountered any
special difficulties in
their colleges because of
their disabilities.
The research unit has
been m a d e possible by
a grant of £11,000 from
the National F u n d for
Research into C r i p p l i n g
Diseases. The Director
of the F u n d , D u n c a n
Guthrie, said today:
" T h e F u n d is deligh-
ted to be able to make
this grant to N . U . S . , Who
will obviously be able to
tackle this p r o b l e m at
the grassroots. I a m c o n -
fident that this project
w i l l lead to a very r a d i -
cal change in the f a c i l i -
ties in higher a n d fur-
ther education for d i s -
abled people. It is quite
clear that m a n y disabled
people are not getting
the education to w h i c h
they have a right. T h i s is
because of architectural
barriers, a n d to lack of
understanding by the
authorities."
