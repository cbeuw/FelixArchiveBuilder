is the winner of the Rag Queen Contest, Miss
Carol Epstein of Computing and Control,
Chosen by both the Rector and Director of
the Institut Francais who managed to drag
themselves away from the Miss World Con-
test. Also running were the " G a y Sisters" as
the most successful Drag Queens. O u r Rag
Chairman reports:
This year's R a g pro-
cession has happened. If
you m i s s e d it then
tough — it won't hap-
pen again this year a n d
it's your loss not mine.
If y o u didn't miss it
then you must be one of
the 1 0 0 people w h o
turned out — 1 0 5 per
cent of them had a g o o d
time, 15 per cent h a d a
reasonable time and 1 0 0
per cent of the carnival
co-ordinators present
can't count. M i s s A l i c e
in G u i l d ' s Land h a d the
best time : a half bottle
of S c o t c h m a y be the
reason for that. (If half
a bottle isn't more than
nothing then nothing i s ) .
A s a special bonus
this year the procession
featured J e z , C l e m a n d
Beautiful B o . T h e first
time they've been seen
together in a l l the time
I've been here. Bass
Charringtons very kindly
let us have three lorries
and three lorry drivers
w h o joined us at the En-
nismore to check on the
quality of the Watneys
Special.
The B . C . lorries were
used by I.F., C. & G . and
R.C.S.
G u i l d ' s float featured
a M a d Hatter's tea party
and I.F. were exhibiting
themselves as Fattery
Breaks at the M o u l i n
Rouge, w i t h their Ever
Ready Collecting C a n
Cans.
R.C.S. h a d two floats
(one from F o r d ' s ) : the
themes were Star Trek
and T h e Mafia. O n the
Mafia float were the
Daughter's of the Mafia
— they appeared to be
in the family w a y . R o n
Kill played the parts of
C o m m a n d e r Pock a n d
A l " S c a r f a c e " Capone.
M i n e s produced a
plastic inflatable coal
mine — a n d success-
fully beat the N . U . M .
overtime ban. A l s o pre-
sent were a M i c h e l in
M a n , a M a r c h Hare (out
of season) a Dormouse
and N ! gorillas. T h e Rag
Queen w a s also present
and it's rumoured that
at one point she sang
like a hit louse core, but
you can't trust all that
you hear. Approximately
£300 w a s raised: G u i l d s
had £140, R C S £90 and
M i n e s about £30 per
inch of a miner's toot.
