Simulated Sex at
Poly Disco leads man
to Murder
The sight of a couple
simulating sexual inter-
course at a Leeds Poly-
technic d i s c o led an
A m e r i c a n student to
murder, it w a s stated in
a Leeds Court last week.
J o h n Francis Reilly,
of Queens Road, H y d e
Park, a 21 year o l d
medical student at K i t -
son College is charged
w i t h the murder of h i s
18 year o l d fellow A m e r -
ican girlfriend, Jill A l l e n -
den, an art student at
J a c o b Kramer College.
Both were members
of the J e s u s Freaks Cult
w h i c h permits couples
to live together but for-
bids sexual intercourse.
On the night of the
alleged murder, Septem-
ber 29th last year, Reilly
went alone to a disco at
the Poly where he s a w a
couple pretending to
make love on the floor,
the sight of w h i c h made
him believe that his girl-
Last Thursday's U G M
was attended by 2 9
people.
The motions to be dis-
cussed were Chile,

convention of the U G M

I always find it diffi-
cult to write reviews for
folk concerts, a n d Sat-
urday night's proved to
be no exception. Every-
one knows what Ralph
M c T e l l stands for, a n d
it w o u l d be pointless to
list the songs, as they
all received a thunder-
ous applause from a well
informed audience. In-
deed, most of them ob-
tained a ripple of ack-
nowledgement.
Despite this concert
being the 26th a n d final

you have all seen a n d
made use of the U S K

are still available in the

you will ever see next

affair with another man.
Then, according to
M r . J a m e s Coussey, pro-
secuting, he went home
and asked M i s s A l l e n d e n
if she w a s having inter-
course with anyone a n d
she became annoyed.
Later, when the couple
were lying on a b e d ,
Reilly put her head on
his shoulder but she pul-
led away a n d got up.
"Reil'ly then grabbed
h e r , " M r . Coussey went
on " a n d pulled her d o w n
and said she w a s a c o l d ,
heartless person. M i s s

he w a s going to be vio-
lent."
Reilly could not con-
tain himself any longer.
He w a s overcome with
emotion a n d he lunged
at her. He put his hands
around her neck a n d
squeezed. He then

N U S secretary, to speak.
The most exciting
thing that happened w a s

a quite detailed account
of the origin a n d mean-
ings of each song, w h i c h
I found interesting, a l -
though I w a s surprised
there weren't several
people w h o thought
otherwise and w o u l d get
restless. But no, the aud-
ience remained silent
throughout the evening's
performance.
Danny T h o m p s o n ,
who appears on Ralph's
latest album " N o t Till
T o m o r r o w " , played the
double bass for four or
five numbers in the
middle of the set. T h e

threat to close down the
of U S K — 1 4 colleges.

ped to the floor. W h e n
Reilly realised what h a d
happened he tried to re-
vive her by giving her
tablets, slapping ner and
pouring water over her.
W h e n this h a d no
effect he knelt d o w n be-
side her body and prayed
for about an hour a n d
then rushed upstairs to
his friend, M r . Peter
Shellard, w h o drove h i m L
to the police station.
M r . Shellard, a post-
graduate at the Poly
stated in court that Reilly
had told h i m he h a d
been on drugs for about
seven years. M i s s A l l e n -
den h a d also been on
drugs, including heroin,
but he thought that they
had both given them up.
Reilly has been re-
m a n d e d in custody to
appear before the C r o w n
Court.
(From " L e e d s Student")
There is a U G M next
Thursday w h i c h cannot
but be better attended
(one hopes).
Perhaps the reason for
the poor turn-out was ex-
pressed by Dave Gribble

respondent " W e l l I

This w a s a joint B e d -
ford/I.C. venture as
usual, centred at Buxton
Y . H . , Derbyshire. It w a s
a memorable weekend,
in that nothing went
drastically w r o n g ; in
fact, it ran m u c h accord-
ing to plan!
On Friday evening,
under threats of fines
and worse from the war-
den, if w e didn't arrive
by 1 0 . 3 0 p.m., w e got
one van away early while
the other van waited 2 0
minutes for some myth-
ical character, w h o h a d
signed the list. A slow
crawl out of London, a
quick dash up the M 1
and a touch of the J a c k i e
Stewarts on the Derby
ring road, s a w us arrive
at the hostel with 15
minutes to spare.
W e were up bright
and early next morning,
and after a slice of por-
ridge a n d some marma-
lade with' toast on it, w e
were all set for action.
Half the party decided
to walk the Goyt Valley,
w h i l e the others took the
van into Buxton to buy
supplies a n d then went
on to Edale, the start of
the Pennine W a y .
The Edale party set off
with an expectant air, up
the dale, but soon dis-
covered that the coeffi-
cient of friction between
boots and peat wasn't all
it might b e ! After c l i m b -
Gayness
Since the N U S voted
to suppo;t Gaysocs in
the colleges a n d fight
against homosexual dis-
crimination gay student
societies have grown
from 19 in April to about
70.
A report is being pre
pared by Alastair Stew-
art, a n N U S executive
member, to be presented
at the Margate confer-
ence last weekend. S o
far it amounts to some
4 0 , 0 0 0 words.
A n appendix is in-
c l u d e d w h i c h gives a d -
vice on setting up Gay-
socs a n d includes the
promise that N U S will
give legal support if the
authorities oppose the
Gaysoc on legal grounds.
A t the Exeter N U S
conference last A p r i
other grounds were
given for not allowing
Gaysoc. M o s t voluble
was M r . Honore from
the School of Slavonic
studies. This is his
speech as minuted . . .
" N o w came the piece
de resistance of the
debate. Despite interrup-
tions Mr. Honore deliv-
ered himself thus: It is
high time this whole
business of gay libera-
tion w a s put into pers-
pective. T h e only so-
called oppression is the
oppression of the' dirty,
sick little m i n d s . I a m
ing up a frozen stream
we reached our objec-
tive, Kinder Scout,
w h i c h turned out to be
a plateau lacerated with
6ft deep peat trenches
and bog, a n d with few
recognisable features, so
navigation proved both
difficult and treacherous.
Since the peat w a s still
frozen, it w a s safe to
leap across the first few
ditches, but after so it
became rather tedious,
so w e were g l a d to reach
the edge and settle down
to M a r s bar sandwiches.
W e spent the after-
noon walking down a n d
along a ridge, back to
the van. This w a s easier
going, although certain
members of the party
managed ' to penetrate
the bogs despite the
covering of ice. W e then
had to kill time in Bux-
ton by going into a cafe
and watching our very
own gourmet devour a
plateful of p'e, beans
and chips.
Back at the hostel, w e
prepared the inevitable
stew, somewhat over-
estimating the quantity
of rice, so it w a s down
to the pub for the even-
ing a n d then back for
coffee and rice p u d d i n g !

M r . Honore: Only on
Tuesday I w a s horrified
to see the retiring Presi-
dent sexually assaulted
by a drunken homo-
sexual (sensation). If
they have nothing better
to do than publicise
their revolting habits
then I suggest they could
do with a short term in

the other party went for
a leisurely walk around
Leek, or set off on the
Southward trail towards
Leek. But it w a s plumb-
ing of a different kind for
us, as w e wrapped up
in the colours of S l o u g h
T o w n F.C., Bedford C o l -
lege, a n d Leeds R.L.,
and proceeded to inspect
Stockport's water supply
down in the Goyt Valley.
W e arrived back at the
rendezvous slightly too
early and so took refuge
in a native's garage:
however our rather bois-
terous physical exer-
cises aroused the owner.
Who kindly locked us
out. D u e to a misunder-
standing w e waited 15
minutes longer than nec-

M r . Honore: I have
been subjected to the
sight of their worthless
literature out in the en-
trance hall. I have seen
their G a y News. W h a t a
miserable publication to
be less gay. They have
no a i m but to carry us
down a sloping path a n d
to w a l l o w in the mire
of depravity a n d unhap-
p h e s s (Hooray). N o
doubt, I have wasted
more time than they de-
serve. But I a m horrified
and y o u should be hor-
rified. There is no reason
why w e should be forced
to join the downhill drift
to the dogs a n d to the
Left. W e are not just
dealing with Reds under
the bed but Reds in the
bed. (Frenzy). It's gone
too far. T h e status quo,
indeed the whole moral
fibre of society is at
stake. This conference
must put its foot down
and say a firm ' N O ' to
these c o m m u n i s t i.-ed
creatures a n d their foul
motion. (Mountainous
roar).
Tho ChoTrman: Thank
you, sir a n d m a d a m .
