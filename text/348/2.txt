L E T T E R S
Idealist
Dear Sir,
W h a t rubbish M r .
Veafl wrote last week, in
stating that religion is a
private matter. His u n -
ci erstanding of man
seems rather short-
sighted and naive, since
it is very m u c h an indi-
vidual's religious beliefs
w h i c h govern his beha-
viour in the society at
large. His understanding
of sociology is remark-
ably lacking for someone
with such firm ideas
about society. Religion
has always been a key
factor in social and nat-
ional behaviour; he
needs only to look at the
M i d d l e East or Ulster to
see how far reaching are
the effects of religious
issues. No, M r . Veall is
wrong, religion is not
private, quite the oppo-
site, it is the public ex-
pression of a person's
beliefs.
However, if M r . Veall
was badly expressing
himself, and meant that
personal Views on mat-
ters of faith s h o u l d not
be openly expressed,
then he i s making a diff-
erent point. He, with his
political views, has the
right to impose them, by
force if necessary on the
country at l a r g e , - w h i l e
the person w i t h a v i e w
of G o d is not to open
his mouth for fear of
s o m e o n e listening. The
hypocrisy of it astounds
me; the sooner M r . Veall
open his eyes and stops
being the idealist with
such a bent v i e w of
human nature, the better
for h i m and us. Religion
a n d politics w i l l always
get m i x e d as long as
people are p e o p l e — M r .
Veall's attitude is non-
sensical.
Yours sincerely,
A l a n Gyrap.
Sympathy
Sir,
W i t h reference to
" S t a n ' s " letter to Felix
about D u t y Officers and
Southside Bar. I was the
duty Officer for Sunday,
18th Nov., but had no i n -
structions beforehand as
to what I was supposed to
do, in spite of specific re-
quests for some. I thought
I had been told I was sup-
posed to "sign i n " some-
where but the girl at the
bar (Southside) H A D
N E V E R H E A R D O F
D U T Y O F F I C E R S — a n d
certainly had not heard of
a book. I just sat around
in the bar all evening—
got very bored—and went
home.
But the real point of the
letter is this. If trouble
occurs W H A T C A N A
D U T Y O F F I C E R R E A L -
L Y D O ? Perhaps I should
have taken m y camera. I
certainly would not have
got more involved. I
I C students cannot behave
in a bar—then the bars
should be closed!—or a
surcharge put on drinks to
pay for a professional
" b o u n c e r " or something.
Members of C o u n c i l —
—the D u t y Officer—spend
a large part of their time
serving the U n i o n — t h e y
should not have to be its
police force too. If a pol-
ice force is needed it
should be employed. I u n -
derstand " H e l l ' s A n g e l s "
offer a competitive ser-
vice. B u t seriously I think
the U n i o n should be ash-
amed that it actually needs
duty officers. Accepting
that at present it does, us-
ing Council Members is a
misuse of the voluntary
time that they are prepar-
ed to give.
Perhaps as an interim
measure, for Southside at
least, the " T e n a n t s " Asso-
ciation should organise the
duty officer rota, if that
doesn't work, perhaps the
bar should be reserved for
residents only—with every
person buying drinks in
the evening having to sign
in. A t least that way iden-
tification of antisocial ele-
ments should be possible.
A s is probably appar-
ent, I feel the whole ques-
tion of duty officers war-
rants a thorough review.
In the meantime Stan has
my fullest sympathies.

S'r,
Congratulations on
your remarkable powers
of logical deduction. I
clearly say I a m not con-
nected with any political
organisation and you
promptly decide I am a
" M a o i s t " !
Yours sincerely,
Kathleen Corcoran.
Insane
Sir,
A s a recent addition
to the ranks of British
Students, I am becoming
increasingly alarmed by
the political attitudes
adopted and propound-
ed by the National Union
of Students.
M y introduction to
this organisation came
during the first week of
m y university career,
w h e n an executive of this
organisation gave a short
talk at a college urtion
meeting. This executive
read a list of 'our' poli-
tical policies, w h i c h w e
were instructed to sup-
port if and when requir-
ed to do so. These poli-
cies leaned so far to-
wards the extreme 'left
w i n g ' that I, personally,
c o u l d not agree w i t h
them. Nevertheless, how-
ever, it seemed fair that
the N . U . S . should re-
quire me to support
them, provided that
these were the views
held by the majority of
students. Thus m y initial
impression of student
political beliefs, gained
entirely from the N . U . S .
was that British Students
were extremely 'left
w i n g ' .
S o m e time has gone
by now, and several col-
lege presidential elec-
tion campaigns have
passed through w h i c h I
have discovered that
few students even re-
motely possess the 'left
w i n g ' politics of the
N.U.S.; indeed most re-
gard these policies as
the Wild thoughts of a
few insane executive
members w h o have used
the students' name as a
means to a d d weight to
their own personal
views.
At this point I should
stress that I am in no
way attacking the N . U . S .
as a student body. Its
contribution to student
a c c o m m o d a t i o n a n d
general amenities has
been enormous and con-
tinues to be so. The
facilities and rights now
enjoyed by students are
largely due to the great
work put in by this body,
work few students do
not appreciate.
M y complaint is lev-
elled at the politically
ambitious executive of
the U n i o n . If they w i s h
to delve into internation-
al politics and air 'left
w i n g ' views, that is their
right. If, however, they
w i s h to delve into poli-
tics, using us students
as their powering force
either let them be sure
that the views expressed
in our name are our
views, or let them be
silent.

Arab Refugees
A s a result of the war
recently fought in the
M i d d l e East a n d the ef-
forts of the Arab people
to liberate their occupied
lands, some 1 0 0 , 0 0 0
people have been left
homeless and destitute
on the W e s t Bank of the
Suez C a n a l . Their homes
have been destroyed and
they are now refugees
without food, clothing
and shelter. These
people need your sup-
port and your help. Any-
thing you can give, par-
ticularly clothing and
blankets, Will be grate-
fully received and put to
good use.
A collection of what-
ever you w i s h to give
will be made in the
Junior C o m m o n R o o m
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
every day from M o n d a y ,
19th November and will
continue for the follow-
ing two weeks.

Mus Musculus and you
Mighty M o u s e has
now taken up residence
in the College.
His ability to climb,
and gnaw through many
materials such as w o o d
and plastic makes every
area accessible to him.
Proofing m e a s u r e s
against mice are extre-
mely difficult as these
small m a m m a l s can
squeeze through any
crack into w h i c h a h u m -
an finger can be inserted.
His eyesight is poor,
he relies on his highly
developed sense of
smell. He makes his
runs with faeces and
urine.
He knows us, better
than w e know h i m , he is
capable of adapting him-
self to every climate and
all living conditions. He
multiplies at an alarm-
ing rate, the filth he col-
lects around him is a
constant hazard to health
and he is a dangerous
carrier of disease.
He Will chew almost
anything, food naturally,
soap, plaster, candles
and plastic piping.
Unfortunately, Dick
Whittington and his cat
have long been gone, the
Pied Piper is a legend,
the cunning rat catcher
and his dog have given
way to modern methods
of dealing with this ever
increasing menace to
health and destruction.
W i t h techniques and
skilled application of
rodenticides this menace
can be controlled and to
carry out this control the
College authorities have
called upon the service
of Profim Pest Control
Limited, a national org-
anisation. In our surveys
throughout the College,
we have found not only
have the mice made
homes in cavities, ducts
and under floor leveis,
they have set up their
own cafeteria systems at
night in the bars, c o m -
mon rooms and all
places used by everyone
in the College. Biscuits,
sweets, crisps, paper for
nesting have been found
on the floors. To help
us, to help you, to pre-
vent the spread of con-
tamination by this dis-
ease carrying nocturnal
creature, please place all
sources of attraction a. id
food, not on the floor but
in the rubbish bins pro-
vided.

Sir,
C o u l d I, through your
pages, ask all those
people who have taken
petition forms back to
their labs, to collect sig-

Wednesday, 28th Nov-
ember. If this deadline
is m i s s e d , the petition
forms w i l l not be deliv-
ered to the D . E . S . Many
thanks to all those who
have helped.
W h o knows, if we get
a London Weighting, w e

drink in South Side bar
too!
