I
t was a bit of a shock when
Ashton Kutcher was picked
to star as the Apple-founding
billionaire in 2013’s biopic
Jobs; he’s not the most likely actor
I would have picked for a historical
breaking of typecasting, but a
role as one of the most iconic and
influential men of the modern
technological revolution being given
to that guy from Dude, Where’s My
Car? was a casting decision reaching
Robin Williams in Good Will
Hunting levels of unexpectedness.
Far from the glimmering success of
Williams’ atypically heartbreaking
performance, Kutcher’s turn in Jobs
appears to have become a bedtime
horror story that agents tell their
actors before they go to sleep: ‘If
you ever break type, the spirit of
Ashton Kutcher’s Steve Jobs will
possess you and you will never be
respected again.’ Shudder. The film
itself was apparently so bad that it
had to be remade within two years
of its release, and so here we are
with Steve Jobs. What’s gratifying
is that it’s been done very, very well
this time.
Deftly executing a rounded story
with narrative action that unfolds
over the course of only three days
in Jobs’ life, each of them launches
for his latest innovation, Steve Jobs
at once feels relaxed and fast-paced,
and always engaging. It’s a feat that
does not necessarily require, but is
greatly helped by, a script written
by Aaron Sorkin (writer of The
Social Network and Moneyball). It’s
been a while since I’ve seen a film
performed in the not-widely-spoken
dialect of Sorkinese, and as soon as
the film’s first conversation began to
play out, I felt old, dusty corners of
my brain fire up in ways they haven’t
done in years. The dialogue is a
concoction of his trademark razor-
sharp witticisms and arguments that
consist of extended monologues as
intricate as they are brutal; though
you may feel as you hear it that this
is definitely not how real people talk
regardless of their intelligence, it’s
so thrilling just to listen to that its
surreal nature can immediately be
forgiven.
It may in fact be one of the best
screenplays director Danny Boyle
has worked with in his career, and
he certainly rises to the occasion
– while it might be impossible to
make a bad film out of a Sorkin
script, Boyle has gone a way towards
making a great one. Not only is the
film excellently shot throughout,but
his taste for subtle tweaks of style
that truly make a film its own come
through in force in Steve Jobs: swells
of music are never overstated, but
perfectly placed; flashbacks to early
days under a mellow,grainy filter are
excellently intercut with present-day
scenes in crystal clear quality; and
costume design is absolutely spot-

Danny Boyle does the Job
With a quickfire script and powerful acting, this is the biopic we’ve been waiting for
on, to the point where the audience
does not see Seth Rogen, Michael
Stuhlbarg and Michael Fassbender
onscreen, but Steve Wozniak, Andy
Hertzfeld and Jobs himself, aging in
real time.
The main reason that these
characters come so vividly to life
is not, however, the accuracy of
their appearances, but that the
performances in the film are
universally excellent. Seth Rogen’s
geeky persona is given a new edge
and ends up forming a perfectly
believable Woz, Jeff Daniels’
experience with Sorkin dialogue on
TV seires The Newsroom pays off well
in his turn as ex-Apple CEO Pete
Sculley,and Kate Winslet’s portrayal
of Joanna Hoffman, Jobs’ ‘working
wife’ and lifelong confidant, is one
of perfectly understated control,
with just enough fire to keep him in
check. But this was always going to
be the Fassbender show, and what

dramedies are somewhat
hard to come by in a
cinema. In fact I’m not
sure many of them exist at all. If you
need to bump up your street cred,
then,Tangerine will definitely be the
edgiest film you’ll see this month,
perhaps this year. Fortunately it’s
got enough substance in it that you
can get more out of it than just a
good story.
When trans sex worker Sin-Dee
finishes a four-week stint in jail, she
finds out from her friend Alexandra
that her boyfriend/pimp has been
cheating on her.An insane day-long
chase across Los Angeles ensues
– part buddy movie, part revenge
thriller, part tragedy, part comedy;
Tangerine’s genre mishmash is
both a strength and a weakness.
There’s an excellently seedy nature
to the story as it deals with LA
low-life, and individual plotlines
such as the struggle of Razmik, an
Armenian taxi driver and family
man in too deep with the underbelly
of prostitution, pack a genuine
emotional punch. However while
the individual performances – a
fantastically charged Kitana Kiki
Rodriguez as Sin-Dee, a hilariously
sassy Mya Taylor as Alexandra, and
a perfect turn by James Ransome
as the pimp in question, who
damn near steals the movie – keep
the dialogue amusing in passing,
there are few real laughs in the
movie.I can’t decide if the fact that
Tangerine was shot entirely on an
iPhone is impressive or distracting;
The cinematography is colourful,
all-encapsulating, and feels quite
naturally lit, but there’s something
wrong with the graininess of the
film, the uncertainty of the camera
movement, and the odd contrast
and focus.
With an in-your-face soundtrack,
at times distracting camerawork,
and a thoroughly defiant attitude
towards critics of its subject matter,
Tangerine may prove hard to
swallow for some viewers at first.
But with profound moments of
insight into its protagonists’ lives,
and a brace of strong performances
to boot, it proves to be a rewarding
experience to those willing to treat
it with patience.
TOM STEPHENS
A
n important and at
times genuinely moving
documentary, Warriors
tells the story of the
Maasai of Nairobi,how their culture
promotes FGM,and its ties into the
AIDS epidemic. In a society where
the elders are believed to have a link
to God, it’s hard for the youth to be
heard. The solution to this? Form
a cricket team. It sounds odd, and
one does spend most of the film
wondering how this club is actually
doing anything to help, but we do
eventually get an idea, if too late.
Firstly, cricket gives links to the
West: the team works with the
British army to build their pitch,
and they travel to Lords to take part
in an amateur competition. All this
gives the men a different perspective
on their often dogmatic culture, and
it is this that spurs them to call for
an end to FGM. Secondly, despite
a fiercely patriarchal society, the
club allows men and women to play
together as equals. Much of the film
is spent following the team as they
train for, and eventually partake in,
their competition.
The question,however,is how does
this quirky tale of a cricket team fit
in with the dark themes tackled?
The answer: it doesn’t really.The film
suffers from an awkward dichotomy
in its tones, reminiscent of when
a news anchor has to swap from a
serious story to a feel-good one –
awkward smile and all. Warriors
would perhaps have worked better

T
ell Spring Not to Come
This Year is named after
a poem chosen by one
of its main subjects:
Commander Jalaluddin of the 3rd
Brigade of the Afghan National
Army (ANA). The poem is a
reflection on rebirth and renewal
a show it is; you care deeply for
Fassbender’s Jobs, even when he’s
shouting at innocent writers of code
or arguing with his long-neglected
daughter; you feel his pain when
he faces failure and his ravenous
hunger for success.
In its examination of a flawed
great man of the modern age, Steve
Jobs bears significant resemblance
to the David Fincher-directed The
Social Network – a difficult film to
hold a candle to, even by Sorkin and
Boyle’s standards. But although it
may not quite have as much instant-
classic flair as The Social Network did,
its stellar script, dazzling direction
and fantastic performances make it a
brilliantly engaging film of the kind
that doesn’t come along too often,
and is very hard to ignore. In fact,
this is one of the most justifiable
‘remakes’ of perhaps the entire 21st
century – and it only took two years
for it to come about.

of a country, and the impossibility
of such a renewal while the land
is still full of death. A mournful
poem, it is in many ways a perfect
encapsulation of what the film
wishes to show us.
Directed jointly by Saeed Taji
Farouky and Michael McEvoy, the
documentary is an utterly beautiful,
haunting piece of cinema. It follows
a year in the lives of the Commander
and his men after the withdrawal of
NATO forces,and their work on the
frontlines to rid Helmand province
of the Taliban.
It would be easy to focus on the
battles – and clearly there were many,
with 31 of the brigade killed in the
documented year – but, a shot isn’t
fired until about halfway through
the film. The directors instead
mainly focus on the relationships,
motivations, and the frustrations
of the men of the brigade, painting
a picture of their lives in a country
they describe as ‘ruined’.
They do this with considerable
artistry, masterful cinematography,
and a poignant score giving a
combined effect reminiscent of a
fairy-tale. But it’s not so removed
as that – it’s personal, intensely so,
drawing you beside these men and
into their everyday experience.
The overwhelming emotion of
the film is of mourning: the men
mourn for their shattered country,
and for their perceived futility to
do anything but keep it hanging
together by a thread.A gripping and
thoughtful documentary, Tell Spring
Not to Come This Year is essential
viewing for anyone interested in the
all too human aftermath of the war
in Afghanistan.
THOMAS CARROLL
T
he reputation The Lady
in the Van has gained
in the run up to its
release can perhaps be
best illustrated by the fact that
during a recent phone-call to my
grandma – a woman in her late 80s
whose closest cinema is the civic
centre, where all films are released
3 months later than anywhere else
– she mentioned that she was very
excited to go and see it.This is what
happens when you blend together
director Nicholas Hynter, actor
Maggie Smith,and playwright Alan
Bennett: you get a national treasure
smoothie, palatable to all.
But while this may be the
reputation the film is conjuring
up, the actual product is far from
populist. Maggie Smith plays Miss
Shepherd, an elderly vagabond with
a past, whose malodorous presence
inflames Mornington Crescent’s
residents’ liberal guilt and innate
disgust in equal measure. Taking
up residence in Alan Bennett’s
driveway, she remains there for
15 years, much to the chagrin
of neighbours. Alex Jennings is
well cast as Bennett, retaining
the Yorkshire playwright’s social
mannerisms that have become so
well established over the years, but
Maggie Smith is the real star of
the show; her character is certainly
sympathetic, but Smith never lets
this spill over into sentimentality, a
permanent sneer etched around her
mouth.
Certain aspects of the film don’t
quite work: a backstory involving a
sinister figure from Shepherd’s past
would be better left out, and the
idea to have two versions of Alan
Bennett’s character – the writer
and the man – does not work as
well as it could have, although it is
an interesting touch. Hytner, fresh
from his tenure at the National
Theatre, where he directed Maggie
Smith in the first stage performance
of The Lady in the Van, does a
very good job at conjuring up the
complex social interactions for
which the North London elite have
become famous.It is a film that goes
down smooth, leaving a sensation of
warm contentment – definitely one
you can take the granny to.
