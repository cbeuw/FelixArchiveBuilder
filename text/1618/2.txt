W
hat a fucking
horrible week. At
the time of writing,
129 people have
died at the hands of terrorists in
Paris.
When things like this happen,
a lot of us can get caught up in
the tweets and the rolling news,
obsessing about how close this all
was to us, and becoming fearful of
carrying on as normal.If you already
had some form of anxiety, a feeling
of superstition you’re vaguely aware
of can turn into full blown panic at
the thought of venturing outside.
Writing down feelings can work
for some. If you flick through to
our welfare section, despite our
reputation here, you’ll see Imperial’s
resources if you are feeling down.
One writer talks about the
therapeutic nature of writing, which
I couldn’t agree more with. I’d be
pretty screwed if I didn’t with this
job. Even after writing this wearily
on a Thursday morning, looking
out over Beit quad, once filled with
beautiful old cherry trees, now

Are you a Corbyn-maniac? Well
good news, his dream chancellor
will be wondering around Imperial
today.
After George Osborne was here
last week, is Imperial becoming a
playground of the politerati? Are
we students the bystanders in a
fight over who can produce more
soundbites from Imperial College
London’s extensive grounds? Is
Dalby Court becoming as rife
with political debate as the Palace
of Westminster’s famous central
lobby? No.
Yo, John, if you’re reading this, can
we interview you? Please?
barren and rain-swept, I feel a little
better. If you find it therapeutic to
write, we can certainly help you do
that here at FELIX.
Our comment section is full to the
brimthisweekofstudentsexpressing
their thoughts and reactions to
the attacks themselves, France’s
response and the new phenomenon
of social media ‘reactions’ at times
like this. Facebook can bring out
a new feature almost instantly, so
the way we publicly deal with these
events, or show our support from
afar has changed. Not only can we
attend vigils, but we can change our
profile pictures. We can ‘check in’.
But does any of this help?
We’ve seen some insightful
reactions from within our own
Imperial community this week,
which can help re-assure us that
there is a bit of sense left. However,
perhaps more suprisingly, I’ve seen
some vitriolic droll, racism and
imagery to rival Nazi propaganda in
its abhorrence.
While most of this stemmed
from American governors, tabloid
illustrators and the general dregs
of the internet, I found this week
that these damaging opinions aren’t
as distant as I’d thought. While I
welcome anonymity for writers,
I do need to know who you are
to publish you. But there’ll be no
Islamophobia in this paper, thanks.
Don’t blame Muslims. Don’t blame
refugees. Don’t preface ‘extremists’
with Islamic. Because they’re not.
The man himself, Stephen
Hawking, will be in the Sherfield
building, talking about theoretical
physics (obvs).
Presented by Imperial’s
Theoretical Physics Group, the talks
will celebrate Einstein’s best loved
theory.
Speakers include Fay Dowker,
a current professor who did her
PhD under Hawking’s supervision,
and Jerome Gauntlett who was the
physics consultant for the oscar-
winning film of Hawking’s life, The
Theory of Everything.
Tickets have obviously been sold
out since the beginning of time.
What’s On
For the looney lefties amongst you,
I bring good tidings: the Student
Assembly Against Austerity is
having its convention at SOAS in
Russell Square this weekend.
Expect the usual NUS faces to
be in attendance. The leader of the
Green Party, Natalie Bennet, and
chair of the Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament, Kate Hudson, will
also be making speeches. Expect
informed discussion and workshops
on PREVENT, Trident, racism and
inequality.
Essential for the socially ‘woke’
Imperial student, wherever you may
be.Tickets are free, obviously.
Museum lates are always a giggle,
and there’s no excuse not to have a
look-in, since it’s literally on your
way to the tube station.
Otherwise, get a little academic
before sport’s night. There’s always
a bar, and the silent disco that takes
place beneath the space exhibit is
sure to cause one of those ‘gee-I’m-
so-glad-I-came-to-university-in-
London’ moments.
Several Imperial lecturers will
making an appearance, so pop your
head in to see your best-loved Maths
professors do what they do best for
sozzled professionals instead of
hungover students.
SATURDAY
Imperial College
Climate
Symposium
10am
SAF Building
The Green Party’s deputy leader,
Amelia Womack,will be at Imperial
this week, delivering the keynote
speech on a day full of workshops,
speeches and discussions on the
policy and economics of climate
change.
With lectures from the
former Chief Scientist from the
Department of Transport, Friends
of the Earth and Climate Outreach,
it’s a must for any self-respecting
climate activist.
Not to be confused with the
Imperial Hub’s London Climate
Forum.
Tickets are £10, including lunch.
