O
n Wednesday the 11th
November, IC 2nd
XV
travelled to Regents’
Park to face the School
of Oriental and Asian Studies in
the first cup game of the season.
After four consecutive wins for
IC, the last two of which were by
over 50 points, playing a team from
a different league meant a solid
performance would be necessary.
Motivation for IC was at it’s peak
with the whole squad knowing that
the toughest teams we will face
will be in this cup, so progression
would be crucial for the team’s
development this season.
After some focused warm-ups,and
a minute’s silence in remembrance
of veterans, Ali Jones kicked off for
IC and the intensity from both sides
was obvious from the first collision.
Early pressure from the IC forwards
forced a penalty at the breakdown
and Ruairi Dunne landed the kick
putting Imperial into an early lead.
SOAS then retaliated and after
several phases of clean ball, were
able to cross over the whitewash to
score the first try of the game.
IC were able to regroup and
hold onto possession for several
phases in SOAS territory and
the communication between
forwards and backs throughout
these attacks led to long periods
of sustained pressure in the SOAS
22. Unfortunately mistakes and
ill-discipline meant the lads went
unrewarded for their efforts in
attack until a slick lineout-and-
drive allowed for a man who always
ensures family comes first, Adam
Motley, to touch down and score
for Imperial in the corner before
halftime. Dunne was unable to
add the conversion but a slim lead
at halftime meant the next points
would be pivotal to the final score.
Although the boys were fired up
from the halftime team talk, poor
communication in defence meant
that SOAS were able to create an
overlap and their winger scored to
take the lead from Imperial. Some
friendly chats ensued with the ref
when both sets of players realised he
had the wrong score written down.
Much to the sadness of Imperial
hearts everywhere, the correct score
was clarified and the game played
on.
IC was forced to play catch-up
for the remainder of the second
half and after another SOAS
penalty due to some dubious work
at the breakdown, the game seemed
beyond saving for Imperial. To
further IC’s struggle, Rob Lawrence
decided to take a 10-minute
breather and IC were forced to play
until fulltime with 14 men.
It took until the very last play of
the match for the 2nd
XV miracle
man, Will Goldberg, to work his
magic and sidestep two defenders to
score under the posts. Dunne kept a
cool head and slotted the conversion
leading to a final score of 15-15.
A draw after 80 minutes led to
some confusion amongst the players;
some where thanking the SOAS
boys for a good game,some thinking
about curries and nightclubs, but
el capitán, Gavin Roberts, had his
mind on the game and realised
a cup game can’t be left at a draw.
After confirmation from ICURFC
headquarters, a further 20 minutes
were about to be played to decide
the winner. The lads regrouped and
immediately got fired up to win the
game and stay in the cup.
IC kicked off through Jones and
SOAS quickly worked their way
back into Imperial’s 22. SOAS
shifted the ball through the
backline, which was brilliantly read
by the phoneless Oli Parker, who
intercepted the final pass and ran
the length of the field to touchdown
under the sticks for IC.
IC finished the first half of extra
time with a seven point lead and
strong commitment to keeping an
overtime clean sheet. Throughout
the second half of extra time, IC
kept possession and territory to
keep SOAS pinned in their own
half.Some good phase play from the
forwardpodsandsilkybacksallowed
flanker Roo Mitchell-Heggs to
burst through a gap and offload just
before the tryline to fresher George
Nicholas who touched down over
the line unopposed. Dunne added
the extras and sealed the win for IC.
There was a small sense of
disappointment that we did not
settle the match through a historic
round of penalty kicks but there will
be opportunity for that later in the
cup.
The victory song and port tasted
extra sweet after a hard-fought win
for the 2’s, and the unbeaten record
holds up for another week.Onwards
and upwards.
