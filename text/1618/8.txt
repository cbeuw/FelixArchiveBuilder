id anyone else have
one of those plastic
Helix rulers that said
‘shatterproof’ on them
back in school? I always saw that as
a challenge.
You could bend those rulers a
surprising distance, nearly a hairpin,
and they’d spring back into their
original shape. Go just a little far
though, and they’d snap clean.
Our planet’s oceans, like a
shatterproof ruler, can take a
surprising amount of abuse. Since
the Industrial Revolution, humans
have been pumping out carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere at
ever-increasing rates. However, not
all of that carbon dioxide remains
in the atmosphere. Roughly 28
percent is taken up by plants during
photosynthesis and a further 26
percent is absorbed by the oceans.
2010 data estimates that 33.4
billion tonnes was released from
burning fossil fuels and cement
manufacture; a further 3.3 billion
tonnes was released due to land use
change, such as deforestation. Nine
billion tonnes of that ends up in the
ocean.
Carbon dioxide dissolves in water
forming weak carbonic acid. For
300 million years our oceans have
maintained a pH of 8.2 making
them slightly basic. Since the
1800s, that pH has dropped to an
average of 8.1 – it’s not an especially
dramatic change in 200 years.That’s
because the ocean functions as a
giant chemical buffer.
Chemical buffers are able to resist
pH changes. Add a bit of acid or
base to a buffer solution and it will
be neutralised. In the ocean, various
carbonate compounds help to
neutralise the carbonic acid formed
by dissolving carbon dioxide. Ocean
chemistry is complex and not fully
understood, but what is clear is
that this buffer system is looking
strained.
Like a shatterproof ruler, there is a
point of no return: a point where the
ocean can no longer neutralise all of
this excess carbon dioxide.
In other words, we’re living on
borrowed time. We’ve been spared Whats beyond the horizon for the ecological health of our oceans? Photo Credit: Wikipedia

acditiy is

Forgotten Oceans
Ocean acidifcation tests the limits of our seas, bringing them to an irreversible
breaking point
the worst impacts of climate change
by the great ocean buffer.
So why is ocean acidification
a problem? Many invertebrates
build their exoskeletons out of
calcium carbonate. This is the same
chemical found in limestone, and
it’s vulnerable to acid erosion. You
can see the effects of acid rain on
limestone buildings throughout the
world, or you can experiment by
dropping some vinegar on marble
chips.
A 2012 study in Nature found
that pteropods, or sea butterflies, in
the Southern Ocean had extensive
damage to their shells from acid
erosion. This is a trend that is
likely to continue, and the impacts
on marine ecosystems could be
devastating. Coral reefs are often
considered the ocean’s nurseries; a
fertile breeding ground for many
species of fish that in turn sustains
human communities.
Corals, like pteropods, build
their exoskeletons from calcium
carbonate. Ocean acidification
runs the risk of not only dissolving
existing corals, but also makes
it harder for them to recover by
limiting the amount of calcium
carbonate that can be precipitated.
Weaker corals are more vulnerable
to tropical storms and cannot
sustain the same volume of life that
we come to expect from them.
At its current rate, ocean acidity
is predicted to increase by a
factor of five by the year 2100 to
concentrations capable of dissolving
sea creatures’ shells in just 45 days.
Marine farmers of lobster and
other invertebrates are rightly
concerned about this. Already,
the oyster industry in the Pacific
Northwest has struggled with high
rates of oyster mortality due to
ocean acidification. A 2013 study
published in Geophysical Research
Letters found that it is becoming
too energetically expensive for
organisms to build shells and
growth rates were slowing.
The cold, polar seas are especially
vulnerable because cold water is
able to store more dissolved carbon
dioxide.Oceans absorb,but they also
emit carbon dioxide. Up until now,
the effect has been net absorption.
However, the problem is not
limited to ocean acidification. With
warming seas,the fear is that carbon
dioxide-saturated oceans will be
forced to give up vast quantities
of their stored gas. If cold polar
seawater is saturated with carbon
dioxide, as that water warms some
Our
planet’s
oceans,
like a
shatter-
proof ruler,
can take a
surprising
amount of
abuse
of that gas will no longer remain
storage. Mass emissions of carbon
dioxide from the oceans itself has
the potential to cause accelerated
climate change at rates we have not
yet experienced.
As with ocean acidification, we
have been spared the worst of
the effects so far. This is because
the oceans are not just a chemical
buffer. They are also resistant
to temperature change. While
atmospheric temperatures have
increased by about 0.6°C over the
past century, in the oceans this
change has only been about 0.1°C.
This is because water has what we
call a high specific heat capacity – it
functions as a storage heater, storing
heat for long periods of time.
Like the ruler, there’s a limit. As a
species, are we really willing to find
out where that limit is? Last week,
a study published in Science found
that much attention had been paid
to the effects of climate change on
land and in the atmosphere, but
little on the ocean. We’re beginning
to understand the economic and
ecological impacts of climate change
in the oceans, but a co-ordinated
response from world governments
has been limited.
They’ve been taking up the strain
for a long time. Now the oceans are
beginning to tire.

weat, urine and other
bodily fluids have long been
known to be the designer
perfumes and colognes
of the animal world. Chemical
signals known as pheromones can
modify the behaviour and biology
of other individuals. They can act as
deterrants between males through
marking territory or establishing
dominance.
Alternatively, pheromones can
turn up the allure by attracting
Female
mice have
a way of
combatting
unwanted
male cues
• The first pheromone was discovered in 1953. It was named “bombykol” and is used by female
silkworm moths to attract males over large distances (sometimes as much as 10km)
• The term pheromone is derived from the Greek words “pheran” (to transfer) and “horman” (to excite)
• Mammals detect pheromones through the VNO (vomeronasal organ) situated in the nose and
connected to the mid-brain
• Humans have been found to have a severely reduced or absent VNO, and so if we respond to
chemical signaling it’s mostly through our normal olfactory (sense of smell) system
• There is still limited scientific evidence that there are human pheromones, despite the existence of
“love potions” containing pheromones being sold online. Most of these concoctions actually use pig
pheromones
• Under stressful conditions such as increased carbon dioxide levels, mice can release alarm pheromones
that cause other mice in near proximity to freeze in order to conserve oxygen.The chemical identity of
this compound remains unknown

potential mates. In this way, it
is usually a signal between two
members of the same species, where
both the sender and receiver get
mutual benefits. This benefit isn’t
always sex - in insects, pheromones
may act in order to cause them to
gather in an aggregation, raise an
alarm or even trigger a chain of
developmental effects.
A new study published a few days
ago by Washington University has
isolated the exact two compounds
that sexually arouse male mice,
acting through the delightful
medium of female urine. Just by
watching mice behaviour, it is
obvious that these chemicals are
present in female urine compared to
that of males. Whereas males stop
to investigate excretions of potential
mates, they swiftly pass on after
encountering a rival male’s marking,
as well as urine from female mice
with no ovaries.
By looking at which compounds
within the urine causes “smell”
neurons to fire within the male
mouse nose, the two “sexy scents”
were distinguished from the other
compounds in the urine. These
chemicals elicit sexual behaviour in
their male mice counterparts.When
these chemicals were added to male
urine and ovary-less female urine,
an increase in sexual male behaviour
was observed as well as prolonged
interest in the urine itself. Each
of these stimulating aromas seem
to have slightly different messages
to convey to the interested male.
One reassures the male that the
mouse is female, and the other that
she is ovulating and ready to mate.
Interestingly, these scents do little
for the male libido when isolated
- they only change male sexual
behaviour when both are present.
The chemicals are waste products
of the female’s steroid metabolism,
and act as a form of communication
from the internal environment of
the female mouse to the external
receptor of the male mice nose. In
this way,it tells males which females
are sexually active so they don’t
waste time and energy pursuing
infertile mates. Although these
chemicals don’t give us the whole
answer to mice sexual responses,
they give us some insight into the
neurobiology of mice behaviour.
This communication works
both ways, however, and another
American study published in July
earlierthisyearhasfoundthatfemale
mice have a way of combatting
unwanted male cues.Non-ovulating
females can actually block irrelevant
male sexual signaling.This is known
as sensory silencing, and works via
hormones such as progesterone
blocking out the receptors required
to sense sex-related chemicals. The
same research team is looking at
whether the human sense of smell
is in any way altered in response to
oscillating hormonal levels.
In the past, pheromone-receptor
interactions have been hard to
study in mammals due to the fact
they are often released in very small
quantities. This is in comparison
to insects, which have been under
scrutiny for around 60 years.Studies
have identified insect pheromones,
their receptors and even the neural
pathways behind them. The reason
for such extensive study on insect
pheromones is due to the use of
them for trapping and monitoring
insect levels in crop fields and
orchards worldwide. More research
is required to truly understand
the workings of mammalian
pheromones to this extent. Boars
have also been under intense study
for pheromonal excretions.
