O
ff the back of the Met
office announcement
on Monday that the
climate is about to pass
the one-degree threshold for global
warming, I sat at my desk trying
to write a coherent piece about the
subject. As I typed away on my
laptop, making notes from articles
and reading up on the subject I
asked myself – “what about the
climate?” Everyone who is anyone
with any real information knows
climate change is happening so
what more is there to write about?
I lay my palms on the table and
sigh– the research hadn’t given me
the momentum I hoped for, and
now I had hit the proverbial cul-
de-sac. I thought about the issue,
read most of this month’s issue of
the National Geographic magazine,
solely dedicated to climate change ,
and sunk further into my chair. To
sum up climate change discussions
in a nutshell: interesting statistics,
the science which proves climate
change is occurring, utilising
renewable energy sources, climate
change’s impact, and initiatives to
combat this. I knew the facts, but
I didn’t really have much to say. I
once heard someone comment that
people who don’t make good writers
are those that didn’t have anything
to say. So I reflected – what could
I say?
I asked myself why I was sitting
trying to write but not finding
much inspiration. And the answer?
I like writing, but I was forcing it.
I realised that of all the things that
I’ve tried to do, writing has come
most easily – it has always been a
pleasure. It’s my experience with
writing that I would like to share.
In this day and age where we’re so
caught up in our own lives, under
the stress of deadlines, of work,
jobs, job applications and constantly
being plugged into our phones, it is
important to find time for yourself.
We’ve all been moulded to be cogs
in the ‘system’ and arguably have
had some of our creativity beaten
out of us in the process.
But it’s creativity and imagination,
and the effort to keep it alive that is
the struggle. I would recommend
writing for the very reason that it is
a means to keep your imagination
alive. It is a great stress reliever,
where you’re able to take what’s on
your chest, place it on paper and
rid yourself of your burdens. In our
lives it’s important to have coping
mechanisms, but more importantly
mechanisms to live sustainably and
satisfactorily. Words are symbols
which express our thoughts and
feelings and there is a certain beauty
in being able to say something and
for people to know exactly what
you mean. Sometimes these words
help you understand what your
thoughts when thinking about a
subject or problem. Putting things
down on paper can help you order
your mind. It is also an attempt to
give expression to thoughts and
feelings you know, but can’t quite
convey even to yourself. From
my anecdotal experience, with
regards to many people’s feelings or
problems, it is being able to express
them that legitimises them. Before ,
its expression it is simply a passing,
unimportant thought, but when
you hear or read it expressed you
realise you had a legitimate point.
Or you realise that you actually have
a problem which needs to be dealt
with.
We live in a time where depression
is a big issue. Pressures at university
can drive us up the wall. Having
to cram information, trying to
understand complex mathematics
from PowerPoint slides, pressures
of exams, friends and that is just
within our own immediate life, let
alone the evil and sadness caused
by poverty, hunger, war, and racism
among many other things. A lot of
timesweneedareleaseinjusttalking
about things but for one reason
or another we can’t. Repression
is the worst thing anyone can do
because the frustration builds up.
Seek help, but for your deepest
secrets and thoughts which you’re
not ready to reveal, writing it on
paper can act as a stepping stone
to getting professional help and
talking about it. Having written it
down, this can have the effect of
helping you articulate your issue
better. Sometimes you may think
Writing as a release
people won’t take you seriously, but
if you can explain your situation
and feelings better it will help.
At other times when you have an
issue you know there is something
wrong because you feel stressed
or demotivated, but you crucially
do not accept that something is
wrong because you cannot express
it.Writing can help in its expression
and thus self-realisation of the
issue. It’s certainly helped me to get
things straight in my head, identify
the source of issues and be able to
articulate them correctly.
So I would recommend that you
find a hobby, release or outlet . It
may be sport, reading, arts and
crafts, or something else entirely.
But if you haven’t found one yet, or
want to try something new, pick up
a pen and maybe you’ll find writing
is what you had been looking for the
whole time.
