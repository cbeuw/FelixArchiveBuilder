Changing your profile picture won’t help
Would you do more to help than click a button?

hen ‘Le Tricolour’
was first adopted
by the Nation of
France in 1794,
the three colours were meant to
represent the Royalty (the white
portion), with the red and blue
representing the arms of the city.
Their representations of the three
colours then changed with the
coming of the French revolution
which caused the colours change
meaning. They were now the three
principal French ideals: liberty,
equality, and fraternity; however it
seems that as of Saturday morning
Facebook has now appropriated
these colours to signify self-
indulgence, egotistic tendencies,
and a disingenuous compassion for
the tragedy of others.
At the time of writing, 129 lives
have been lost as a result of the
three co-ordinated attacks on
Friday night in Paris leading to the
first national state of emergency in
France since 2005. This is terrorism
not occurring thousands of miles
away, causing asylum seekers to flee
their homes; this is on our European
doorstep and Islamic extremism is a
threat that must be countered with
increased awareness and increased
security. However, the one thing
that we can do without, and one
thing that will not aid this war is
the option to temporarily change
our profile pictures.
Facebook, as a social media outlet,
has increasingly been trying to
humanise its interface by attempting
to transmit empathy through a
computer screen, however, the end
result is as far away from human
empathy as possible. The fact that
it was only when tragedy struck a
western nation that Facebook felt
the need to remind us to show our
support’ is in itself offensive. On
the 12th
of November there were
multiple suicide bombings leading
to estimated deaths of 43 people;
however the overlay of Lebanon’s
red and white with a tree in the
middle was not offered to anyone.
My problem is not with the idea
of showing support towards those
affected by the tragedy in Paris,
but rather the false sentiment that
they show solidarity, leading to the
idea of being socially conscious
or compassionate as a “me too”
activity rather than people actually
consciously thinking about the
larger issues at hand. Instead
of considering how our social
landscape is changing,how that may
affect the way security is run in our
country, or even campaigning for
our government to make a greater
effort in taking in asylum seekers,all
that is occurring is a careless click of
a mouse.
If there was ever a sign that
this action was one of the most
disingenuous actions of recent
times,just look down your newsfeed
at how many people were quick
to change it back to their original
picture once supporting France was
no longer the zeitgeist. To clarify,
however, I believe that Facebook is
the one whose motives are morally
contentious, treating France’s
tragedy as a plaything. I would ask:
if people are actually inclined to
show solidarity with France, would
they be prepared to do more than
click a button on their home page?
This is everyone’s fight
Jeremy Hunt’s plans for junior doctor contracts will affect the care you receive
Sarah Sturrock

Facebook
has now
appropriated
these
colours
I
’m aware that the media
and Facebook may have
recently reached saturation
with heartfelt pleas for help
from the medic community. I
have undoubtedly littered friends’
timelines with tearjerking videos,
angry statistic-riddled rants and
protest photos. However, Jeremy
Hunt still refuses to listen and I
believe you, the voting public and
NHS patients, deserve to know
what’s happening. I hope you might
even join the debate.
There are many ways in which
the new contracts will be damaging
to doctors’ personal lives and bank
accounts, but I’m writing today to
tell you the most important part:
it will affect the care you receive
as an NHS patient. Currently,
trusts are penalised financially for
giving doctors rotas that include
an excessive number of ‘antisocial’
hours. Consequently, doctors
retain some circadian rhythm and,
generally, are able to care for their
mental and physical health as any
professional would expect to do.
Under Jeremy Hunt’s proposals,
these penalties will be removed.
Instead of this proactive, financial
incentive for NHS Trusts to
ensure safe working hours, Jeremy
would rather that our rotas are
sporadically monitored by the
Care Quality Commission or
that juniors themselves become
the whistleblowers. This means
that any unsafe rotas would only
be picked up retrospectively, and
hence dangerous mistakes may
have already been made. Although
assurances have been made by NHS
employers that the working hours
will not be extreme, rotas released
on their own website show the
opposite, with isolated night shifts
in the middle of plenty of 13-hour
days.
So, what is the justification
for this? Jeremy has masterfully
misrepresented evidence published
in the BMJ, claiming that patients
are more likely to die if admitted
at the weekend because there are
less staff working on Saturdays and
Sundays – and hence, junior doctors
apparently need to take on more
hours, and more antisocial hours,
within the pay envelope. However,
there was merely a statistical excess
of deaths at the weekend – the
authors themselves admitted it
would be “rash and misleading”
to assume that these are avoidable
deaths.
There is a lot more to say on
this topic, and I would welcome
any Imperial students who would
like to know more to peruse the
BMA’s website, or contact me for
more information. We want to
give you the best care we can, and
that requires us to have a safe, fair
contract.

Are air strikes the right response?
Delivering ‘death from above’ won’t weaken ISIS’ battle for hearts and minds
Cale Tilford
Music Editor
I
n the wake of last Friday’s
horrific attacks on Paris, it’s
important that we remain
calm and collected when
dealing with our enemies. To defeat
terrorism we need a well thought
out and multilateral response.
Instead, on Saturday, Francois
Hollande responded with a futile
act of revenge.By bombing ISIS and
declaring war, we prove their world
view, that the world is black and
white, and play into the insidious
narrative of us versus them.
Just two days after the death of
132 innocent civilians, the French
military launched fresh strikes on
the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa in
Syria. There is no doubt that the
militants killed in this attack were
awful human beings, but it’s sad
that so soon after a tragedy we
are willing to respond with such
destructive violence. It seems as if
the violence of the west is far more
palatable than those who oppose
us. We should treat all murder with
similar disgust.
Moreover, we must question
the effectiveness of airstrikes
in combating ISIS in Iraq and
Syria. The American and French
bombing campaigns seem to have
done little to stop the terror that
ISIS create. In fact, they seem to
have inspired more people to join
the terrorist group. Airstrikes are
merely a simple, public appeasing,
and largely inadequate solution to a
complex problem. So, it’s worrying
that David Cameron now seeks
to involve Britain in the same
nationalistic display of military
power.
When we drop death from
above, it invariably results in the
slaughter of innocent civilians.
Not only is it immoral, but when
you kill someone’s brother, aunt,
or grandmother you are likely to
create more allies for ISIS on the
ground. Although we don’t do it
intentionally, we arbitrarily value
certain lives over others and we
continue to justify accidental deaths
as necessary by-products of war.
The recent attack on the Kunduz
hospital in Afghanistan that left
22 dead proves that our military is
not yet capable of reducing civilian
casualties to ‘acceptable’ levels.
Sometimes the people we attack
have already proven their guilt. But
instead of bringing the perpetrators
of heinous attacks to account, we
respond with wrath and fury. In
these cases we have the ability to
truly distinguish ourselves from the
barbarity of our enemies.
The last thing ISIS want us to do
is to bring them to trial and surely
in the case of Mohammed Emwazi
(Jihadi John), a British citizen, we
should have dealt with their crimes
under British law, rather than under
state-conducted vigilantism.
If we allow the warmongering
rhetoric of our leaders and media to
continue then we will never be able
to defeat terrorism in its current
form. A single civilian casualty
should never be accepted nor should
we respond with vengeance. We
cannot play into the hands of ISIS;
they yearn for a world of absolutes
without a grey area in between.
The modern way of dealing with crises
Facebook’s ‘I’m safe’ button and French flag filters have divided critics

I
n the deadliest attack on
French soil since WWII,
panic and chaos unfolded in
the French capital this week.
Many people were left worried that
their relatives, family and friends
had been amongst those murdered
or injured.
In what initially was a welcome
move, Facebook launched the ‘I’m
safe’ button for people to confirm
via social media that they were
okay. Previously used by Facebook
during natural disasters, the button’s
use has expanded during the Paris
attacks to encompass human
conflict.Facebook has since received
criticism because the button was
not made available to people in
the Beirut bombings that killed 43
the day before the Paris attacks.
Theories surfaced online about how
‘French lives are more valuable than
Arab ones’, which fueled the debate
on inequality.
In a statement, Facebook called
its safety check a “relatively new
feature”.
“The product will continue to
evolve as we learn more about how
it’s used during different crises. We
hope to never be confronted with a
situation like this again,but if we are,
we are of course open to activating
the tool given how reassuring it has
been for people in Paris”.
FacebookalsolaunchedtheFrench
flag filter which I’m sure readers
will be familiar with; many of your
friends showing solidarity with the
French people by applying the filter
to their profile picture. Lebanese
bloggers criticised Facebook for
not making a Lebanese flag filter
available. The filter has also been
criticised by some people, as being
not the most appropriate to show
support to the French people, since
few of those who have that filter
activated know any victim of the
attacks and that it’s just something
to boost one’s appeal on social
media. We live in a world where
showing your picture with the filter
is a political statement, that echoes
through social media. It signals
solidarity with the French people,
with the idea that collectively we are
stronger and that wherever we can,
we will help each other. It’s hard to
judge people’s intentions in times of
crisis, but the debate about the role
of social media in a time of crisis has
certainly been revived.
It’s sad to see we live in a world
where we need to check in on
Facebook to say we’re safe from
monstrous nihilistic ideology rather
than check in a nice French bistro at
the heart of Paris.We do live in dark
time but we must carry on with our
way of living or the attackers’ goals
of generating fear and disruption
will have succeeded.
