HANGMAN
CANCER
VIRGO
This week in an attempt to
spice up your sex life with
your partner you decide to
order some saucy outfits
as well as a litre of lube;
however, you accidentally
send it to your home address.
You return at Christmas to
you find the mango lube half
empty.

This week you hope to finally
have a threesome so you
decide to post an advert on
your course’s Blackboard
page. Most Physics boys are
too scared at this concept
so you only get one reply
but unfortunately it’s your
thermodynamics lecturer.
This week your housemate
that spends every night at
her boyfriend’s is finally
back but she seems to have
aged dramatically. Turns out
whilst she was away she had
like 3 kids. Time flies when
you’re at Imperial, I guess.
This week, you are the
FELIX Editor. Yet again,
you find yourself reprinting
the same bloody images at
the whim of Hangman. We’d
say it sucks to be you, but you
actually get paid to deal with
our nonsense.
This week you (unlike most
other Imperial students) get
laid! Congratulations! The
problem is you went out on
the ACC sports night and are
forced to go into your 9am
labs in the outfit you wore
the night before. Perhaps you
shouldn’t have dressed as the
murdered quad tree.
This week you are no longer
allowed into FiveSixEight
for some reason but due
to inebriation you can’t
remember quite what.
However, upon asking
around you discover that you
tried to have sex with the
new tree in the quad.
This week you try to go to
a press screening of a new
Russian ballet documentary
in SoHo. However, you
mistakenly go into brothel
and it turns out that the
Romanov Dynasty shows all
extravaganza is not what you
expected.
This week your routine of
having a shower in halls at
precisely 9pm is interrupted
when you find that an
impromptu orgy has been
organised in the communal
showers. Quite frankly you
are just annoyed that you
received no invitation.
This week you are convinced
that you met the love of
your life whilst visiting a
friend at Loughborough
University; however, all you
can remember is that he was
playing Danny from Grease
so you tweet a nude to John
Travolta in hope of being
reunited.
This week as horoscopes
writer you realise how much
you hate this fucking job. I
mean no one even knows
who I am? Bullshit. I spend
like an hour on these. Some
of these are even real so I’ve
had to carefully write them to
protect anonymity. Fuck you,
FELIX.
This week your Irish dance
Horizons teacher is driven
to the edge due to the fact
you no longer reply to her
emails, causing her to remove
your legs so you are no longer
allowed to dance. At least
you can claim mitigating
circumstances.
This week you are very close
to finishing your Mech Eng
masters project and once it
is done all of humanity will
thank you. However, when
you show it to your supervisor
he doesn’t think a robot that
alerts you to when someone
is going to walk in on you
masturbating is a good idea.

What’s going on inside the
Blue Cube this week
What is: Science?
For those of you who are perhaps a little
new to this ‘College of Science, Technology
and Medicine’ business, we’re running a
special catch-up session just for you!
That’sright,thisweek’s‘Whatis’isexclusively
devoted to science - all of it! Come on over
to the Boardroom from 1pm on Monday to
discover all the wonders that science holds
in store for you, and why it’s clearly a much
better choice for universities to specialise in
than all of that “humanities” nonsense.
Staff wishing to know more about the
humanities, rather than science, should get
in contact with the Vice Provost (Grievance
Procedures), Celia Overup, at c.overup@
imperial.ac.uk, whereupon Celia will be
able to provide you with more information.
Any resemblance between this information
and a p45 is purely coincidental.
Blue3
Launch Party
The end of November draws near, and that
can only mean one thing - that’s right, it’s
time for our pre-Christmas Party!
Due to the College Closure over the
December/January period (not a “cheeky
month-and-a-half’s holiday”, as some staff
have been heard referring to it as), we are
of course completely unable to celebrate
Christmas together at the correct time.
Withthatinmind,we’redelightedtoconfirm
this year’s Pre-Christmas Party will be held
on Wednesday in the Boardroom from 1pm
– there will be a small competition to come
up with a better name than ‘Pre-Christmas
Party’, and as we all know, competitions
mean prizes, so don’t miss out!
We look forward to seeing you there – don’t
forget your party hats and yoga mats, and
green tea will (of course) be provided!
What’sOnoutsidetheBlue
Cube this week
Following on from last week’s campus-wide
(if not city-wide!) rejoicing at the rebirth,
relaunch and redesign of Blue3
, we’re still
not entirely sure what’s actually happening
beyond these fine, four walls of this brilliant,
blue building we all love to work in.
We did send out a couple of the interns to
try and discern what “the haps” (as I am
reliably informed the kids these days are
saying) were for the common or garden
student, but this provided regrettably
inconclusive results.
Alice Gast: Thought of the Week
“I took the chance to look at our wonderful
institution through the lens of an outsider this
week, drinking in all this wonderful science
knowledge without any experience of what it’s
really like inside. As this hypothetical outside, I
marvelled at our wonderful prime real estate,
spread across London, and I admired our
world-leading facilities. But, most importantly,
I celebrated the fact that we don’t have any of
those bloody humanities students to drag us
down.”
The weekly newsletter of the Faculty Building
Blue3
Provost Post of
the Week
Every week, we like to
provide the opportunity for
one of our wonderful Vice
Provosts to write a short
column on a topic of their
choice. Providing our staff
with the opportunity to
communicate to the masses
in such a highly respected
organ as Blue3
is key to our
continued commitment to
staff development here in the
Blue Cube. This week, we’ve
asked the Vice Provost (Staff
Management), Reese Huffle,
to give us a few words!
Hi everybody!
I’m delighted to be able
to take this opportunity to
share a few words with all you
magnificent workers of the Blue
Cube, and I’d like to thank the
boys (and girl!) in Comms for
maintaining such a fantastic
publication. I’d also like to
thank Alice for giving me this
prestigious slot, and I’m sure
she won’t be disappointed with
what I’ve got to show you all!
Unfortunately, Reese was
unable to complete his column
due to an unexpected top-
down reorganisation of his
department. As a result of this
organisational restructure,
some minor down-sizing
occurred, and Reese was
regrettably shuffled off to
another, lesser paid job in
some other, less world-leading
institution.
Due to Reese no longer
being with us, we regret that
we may have to cut this week’s
Provost Post somewhat shorter
than we would like, and feel
that this lack of commitment
and willingness to see things
through to the end, no matter
what, is typical of Reese’s
attitude and perhaps indicative
of why the time had come for
him to be (forcibly) moved on.
Anyone with any queries
or concerns over the recent
staffing changes can of course
get in touch with our staff
complaints email address,
disciplinaryproceedings@
imperial.ac.uk.
Hello all,
Good morning, good afternoon and good evening, and welcome back to
another wonderful issue of Blue3
!
It’s been a hectic week here in the Faculty Building, and I’m sure you
can’t wait to take the chance to de-stress, put your feet up in one of our
specially-designed break-out areas, and catch up with all the latest news
from across the Imperial campus (well, the important parts of it, anyway)!
After all the excitement of the Blue3
relaunch last week, everything
was going to feel like a bit of an anti-climax, so we can understand any
element of disappointment or feeling of diminishing returns you might
get while perusing this week’s copy, but rest assured: the lovely boys (and
girl!) in Comms assure me they have plenty of fabulous and exciting tricks
left up their sleeves!
This week’s big, blue news is of course that Imperial has been making
a splash in the media with our latest commitment to Doing Science™
(can someone please check if this is the correct trademak? We have so
many, and I’d hate to accidentally muck up the branding). We’ve been
covered in some very big national newspapers for our forthright and
uncompromising new position on antibiotics, and I’m very glad to see the
positive and encouraging response from the world at large.
Some expressed surprise that we were taking such a strong and world-
leading Stance on Science™ (again, can someone please check if this is
correct? All this branding business is hard work), and I had to laugh. As
a Science Stronghold™ (that’s one I just made up, can someone actually
get that trademarked please?), of course we are taking the lead on such
important issues as “people should have antibiotics” and “antibiotics”,
because if not us, who? Those posh tossers at Cambridge? I don’t think
so.
We’ve also apparently been up to some nonsense with “cryptocurrency”,
whatever that is. One of the interns tried to explain “Bitcoin” to me the
other day, but why anyone would want a bit of a coin when they could
just have a whole one (or rather, lots of whole ones) is completely beyond
me! Kids these days.
Have a happy, prosperous, wonderful and collaborative week!
