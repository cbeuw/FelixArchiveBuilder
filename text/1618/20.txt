Home is so sad. It stays as it was left,
Shaped to the comfort of the last to go
As if to win them back. Instead, bereft
Of anyone to please, it withers so,
Having no heart to put aside the theft
And turn again to what it started as,
A joyous shot at how things ought to be,
Long fallen wide. You can see how it was:
Look at the pictures and the cutlery.
The music in the piano stool. That vase.		
Home is so Sad

L
ast Wednesday, a
constellation of comedy
stars performed at the
Eventim Apollo’s one off
Stand Up in Action benefit to raise
money for Action-Aid and the UN
Refugee Agency (UNHCR), the
charities providing aid in response
to the global refugee crisis.
The night included routines by
Jo Brand (Getting On, GBBO
An Extra Slice) , Jack Whitehall
(Fresh Meat, Bad Education),
Russell Howard (Russell Howard’s
Good News), Reginald D Hunter
(Reginald D Hunter’s Songs of the
South), and Dara O’Briain (Mock
the Week) amongst others.
It’s a testament to the importance
of the issue that the organisers were
able to put together such a famous
line up.
Greg Davies (Man Down,
The Inbetweeners) acted as host,
regaling the audience with short
anecdotes, previously included in
his Edinburgh Festival show ‘Firing
Cheeseballs at a Dog’audience
favourites included ‘The S&M Dog’
and the various tales of ‘Rachel the
Slag’ in between acts.
Reusing old material was the
common theme, unsurprising since
the whole gig was organized in
three weeks. Russell Howard stole
the show with a set combining
righteous political anger with
stories about his mum, all delivered
with a brilliant comedic timing, mix
Russell
Howard stole
the show
with political
anger and
stories about
his mum
familiar to fans of Russell Howard’s
Good News.
Most of the comics played it safe,
perhaps mindful that they were
performing to raise money for
charity and not to create headlines
(and ticket sales) with outrageous
view. Reginald D Hunter, no
stranger to controversy, seemed not
to have got the memo; his jokes
seemingly justifying the actions of
Bill Cosby deservedly fell flat.
The night is estimated to
have made over £100,000 funds
both Action Aid and UNHCR
desperately need in order to help
relieve the suffering of refugees
crossing Europe’s borders and
remaining in the Middle East.
Action Aid has focused its efforts
on Syrian refugees in Jordan and
Lebanon, and is also giving out
information to refugees arriving by
boat to Lesbos. The UNHCR have
deployed emergency personnel to
provide safety to refugees travelling
through Europe, and has helped
over 60 million displaced people
across the world.
			
The final issue of this term’s FELIX will feature the Autumn 2015 issue of The Phoenix (hopefully) jam packed full
of the best arty things Imperial has to offer. We’re looking for paintings, photographs, poetry, or short stories.
Send in your work to arts.felix@ic.ac.uk by 29th
November.

The
est. 1887
IS BACK !
A
lthough I can’t say
I’ve ever been called
uncultured, I’m still a
cultural virgin in many
respects. I’ve never gone to the
ballet, and my last brush with opera
resulted in a 3rd
act power nap (it was
four hours long and in French, just
saying). I’ve also never picked up
Shakespeare, let alone sat through
one of his plays. So when Max
procured a ticket for Henry V, I took
the opportunity and popped my
Shakespearean cherry. As expected
it was dramatic. (Zing!)
Many of the cast’s comedic
performances were stellar,extracting
copious amounts of laughter from
the audience, particularly adorably
funny Oliver Ford Davies as Chorus,
Joshua Richards as a chatter-boxy
Fluellen and Jennifer Kirby as an
infantile, alas delightful Katherine.
Most other French parts were also
hilarious,albeit borderline offensive.
But it’s a play about the English
ripping the French a new one,
written in 1599, so I guess I’ll let
it slide. The audience certainly did,
as during their performances LOLs
echoed all round and for a few brief
moments, we were transformed
back to Shakespearean times, where
this play would have been executed
in front of nasty hecklers and gangs
of riff raff, busy heaving, shoving,
winking and smiling. Good times.
Music, costumes, sets and effects
were similarly brilliant and really

The Royal Shakespeare Company’s Henry V at the Barbican sursprises and delights
added to the experience.
But performances of the more
serious dramatic roles, particularly
that of Henry V, performed by
Alex Hassel, were surprising. Sure,
I’m not a Shakespeare buff, (even
though I’ll have you know I have
watched both Shakespeare in Love,
and Anonymous, so I’m somewhat
of an expert). I was, however,
expecting a rendition of king Henry
as strong, mighty, possibly sporting
a mohawk, kicking ass and taking
names, you know, oozing national
pride. Instead I saw a childlike
psychopath, voice breaking every
so often, going through emotional
states like a nymphomaniac through
sets of linen. His performance made
Henry V seem dark, twisted and
possibly a bit unhinged, which
is a far cry from what I assume
Shakespeare was aiming for when
creating the character, given that
probably would have been a capital
crime back in good ol’ Elizabethan
England.
But I personally liked it, finding it
an accurate depiction of monarchy.
So, if you’d like to see a play
*SPOILER ALERT* about a
young royal sociopath who gets
so angry after receiving a box of
tennis balls from the French prince
that he decides to declare war on
said prince’s kingdom, which he
somehow miraculously wins and
proceeds to awkwardly court and
marry the French princess (who I
think is also his cousin?), then this
is the play for you.
Verdict: 7/10 hobnobs*
*Yes, hob and nob first came
together in Shakespeare’s Twelfth
Night – Thanks, Internet.
