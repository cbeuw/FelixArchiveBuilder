The top three
sports films
that aren’t
Rocky
P
eople always say the
original Rocky is a classic,
but I’ve never really seen
this. I challenge its fans to
watch it again today, and tell me it’s
aged well. Yes, there are some iconic
scenes,but this is not because they’re
good – rather it’s because the film
was popular. What we have here is
a serious case of nostalgia goggles.
Here are some alternatives:
Raging Bull (1980)
The better film about an Italian-
American underdog boxer, Raging
BullisRockywithoutthemelodrama.
Scorsese replaces Avildsen, and
De Niro – in his best role bar The
Godfather 2 – replaces Stallone.
It’s a bit like that scene in Shaun of
the Dead where the cast meet their
superior alternate versions. Raging
Bull isn’t an easy watch but there’s
a reason people have written whole
books about it.
The Wrestler (2008)
Another film I could write about
for years, The Wrestler is one of
Darren Aronofsky‘s best films.
The backstory here is interesting
enough, with Mickey Rourke
making a return to cinema after
huge issues with drugs and plastic
surgery. His story is reflected in that
of the main character Randy “The
Ram” Robinson, whose tale is one
of a washed-out ex-wrestler and
his attempts to reconnect with his
daughter whilst resisting the lure of
a comeback.
Space Jam (1996)
Space Jam may not be a work of
cinematic mastery like Raging Bull
or The Wrestler but damn it’s still an
amazing film.The ridiculous pairing
of Michael Jordan and the Looney
Tunes is one only the greediest and
most brilliant of film companies
could think up. More intelligent
than one would think, the film
is genuinely funny in parts. The
question is, does me liking this film
for mostly nostalgic reasons make
me a hypocrite considering my
thoughts on Rocky? A little bit, but
to be fair Space Jam’s theme song is
way better.

The cinema is an instrument of
poetry
This week sees the start of a retrospective of Luis Buñuel, the
radical Spanish filmmaker, at London’s ICA. We take a look at the
director’s life and work, identifying the key themes at play in his
films: sexuality, satire, and surrealism
L
uis Buñuel Portolés was a
Spanish filmmaker who
worked in Spain, Mexico,
and France. Born in 1900,
at the very beginning of the new
century, he lived to witness two
world wars, as well as the liberation
of Spain from Francisco Franco’s
36-year-long dictatorship, before
his death in 1983.
Considered to have been a leader
of avant-garde surrealism in his
early years, Buñuel was a dominant
figure in international filmmaking,
often regarded as a moralist and
revolutionary. His career lasted 48
years, spanning from 1929 to 1977,
with his work exploring nearly
every genre in film, yet despite this
versatility, his films possess certain
traits that clearly distinguish him
as an auteur. One such trait was his
highly functional and uncluttered
he would put on for friends at the
time, by projecting shadows on
a screen using a bedsheet and a
magic lantern – an object which
also evoked Ingmar Bergman’s
filmmaking talent.
In 1917 Buñuel enrolled at the
University of Madrid for a degree
in agronomy, but switched to
industrial engineering, and then
finally to philosophy. It was there
that he would meet and develop
intimate relationships with painter
Salvador Dalí and poet Federico
García Lorca, the three of them
forming the core of the Spanish
surrealist avant-garde. During
his student years, Buñuel became
an accomplished hypnotist: in
fact, he insisted that the darkness
of the theatre and the rapidly
changing scenes, lights and camera
movements, weaken the spectator’s
Jeanne Rucar, whom he married in
1934.
His first picture, Un Chien
Andalou, was made at the very
end of the silent era, in 1929. It
is a 16-minute short, which he
co-wrote and directed with Dalí,
based on a dream each of them had
had, extremely Freudian in nature;
the two deliberately contrasted
Epstein’s approach to filmmaking
by deliberately making a point of
eliminating all logical associations
from the narrative. “Historically,”
he wrote, “the film represents a
violent reaction against what in
those days was called ‘avant-garde’,
which was aimed exclusively at
artistic sensibility and the audience’s
reason.” Alas, unfortunately for
Buñuel, the film was a huge success
among the French bourgeoisie!
Due to a clash between Dalí’s
eccentric, but nonetheless rightist,
ideology and Buñuel’s strong leftist
sympathies, his first feature film,
L’Age d’Or – originally meant to
be a collaboration between the two
– ended up being shot entirely by
Buñuel himself.Completed in 1930,
Dalí proclaimed the film was a
visual style, with an emphasis on
character-defining elements in the
shot,and elimination of unnecessary
detail. Another was his own ‘stock
company’ of trusted cast and crew,
used repeatedly in his productions
(same way that a score by Danny
Elfman written for a movie
starring Johnny Depp screams
‘Tim Burton’). Finally, his repeated
use of the traditional drums from
his birthplace of Calanda in his
films, have been described as a
‘biofilmographic signature’ of his.
Buñuel spent his childhood and
adolescence in Zaragoza, where he
received a strict Jesuit education.
By the time he was 16, however,
he came to perceive the Church as
illogical and had grown disgusted of
its wealth and power. Perhaps one
of the first signs of his fascination
with cinema, were the ‘productions’
critical intelligence and exercise
over him a kind of fascination, akin
to hypnosis.
The film that played a catalytic role
in Buñuel pursuing his interest in
film was Fritz Lang’s Der müde Tod,
aka Destiny (1921). “Images could
and did become”, for him, “the true
means of expression”and he decided
to devote himself to the cinema. At
age 72, an ever-enthusiastic Buñuel
asked Lang for his autograph.
In 1925 Buñuel moved to Paris,
where he decided to enter the film
industry, enrolling in a private
school run by one of the most
celebrated commercial directors in
France at the time, Jean Epstein.
He worked for Epstein as assistant
director until 1927, and after that
he worked as a film critic,helping to
establish Madrid’s first cinema club.
It was around that time that he met
deliberate attack on Catholicism; it
caused such a scandal that the film
was withdrawn from circulation,not
to be seen again until 1979.
Thanks to the succès de scandale,
Buñuel spent a short while in
Hollywood working with MGM,
and associated with iconic figures of
the time, such as Sergei Eisenstein,
Josef Von Sternberg, Charles
Chaplin, and Bertolt Brecht, before
returning to pre-Civil War Spain
in 1932, at a time of political
and social turbulence. His next
film, Las Hurdes: Tierra Sin Pan,
focused on peasant life in Spain,
and is one of the first examples of
a mockumentary. Buñuel was able
to reconcile his political ideology
with his surrealistic aesthetic in
what was labelled as a ‘surrealist
documentary’. After this, he worked
in dubbing studios in Paris and
Madrid, before producing films for
a mass audience with Spanish film
company Filmófono, insisting that
he remain anonymous so that he
may preserve his reputation as a
surrealist. During the Spanish Civil
War(1936-1939),Buñuelessentially
functioned as the coordinator of
film propaganda for the Republic;
the Spanish Ambassador suggested
that he revisit Hollywood, where he
could give technical advice on films
being made there about the war,and
so he did.
However, the National Legion of
Decency,an organisation combating
content in motion pictures
objectionable from the point of
view of the Catholic Church, saw to
it that his work in Hollywood was
left unfinished. Buñuel managed
to sell some gags to Chaplin for
The Great Dictator (1940), but
was otherwise unfit for success in

Hollywood, lacking the arrogance
and pushiness necessary for it,
according to his biographer Ruth
Brandon.Receiving no interest from
even independent producers in LA,
Buñuel moved to New York, where
he worked at the MoMA, gathering
anti-fascist films to be distributed in
Latin America.
Finding himself in Mexico
in 1946, as the Golden Age of
Mexican cinema was climaxing,
Buñuel attempted to learn a thing
or two about ‘normal’ cinema.
Teaming up with Óscar Dancigers,
a Russian émigré producer active
in Mexico, he directed the musical
period drama Gran Casino (1947),
which was turned out to be a
disaster, perhaps due to Buñuel’s
rusty technical skills after so many
years out of the director’s chair. El
Gran Calavera, on the other hand,
a hilarious eccentric satire of the
Mexican nouveau riche, was an
instant hit at the box office in 1949.
Because of this success, he was able
to claim more freedom in his next
film project: Los Olvidados (1950).
However,thefilmwastakenbymany
as an insult to Mexican sensibilities
and the Mexican nation, with some
even asking for Buñuel’s recently-
acquired Mexican citizenship to
be revoked. Fearing a complete
fiasco, Dancigers commissioned
an alternate ‘happy ending’ to the
film, but was forced to withdraw
it after only three days in theatres
due to poor attendance. Nobel
Laureate in Literature Octavio Paz,
however, promoted Los Olvidados
and Buñuel won the Best Director
award at Cannes Film Fesitval for it.
Buñuel remained in Mexico for
the rest of his life, completing over
20 more films by the end of his
career. His first film in colour, also
his first in the English language,was
Robinson Crusoe (1954), followed by
The Young One (1960), for which a
Harlem newspaper even wrote that
he should be ‘hung upside down
from a lamppost on Fifth Avenue.’
Other films of his that gained
international recognition were Él
(1953), Viridiana (1961), Belle de
Jour (1967), and his very last film,
That Obscure Object of Desire (1977).
While some consider the majority
of his work to have consisted of
films adapted to the norms of the
national film industry,others believe
there is a deceptive complexity
within it, which offers ‘a sustained
mediation on ideas of religion,
class inequity, violence and desire.’
His work indeed often dealt with
themes central to his lifelong
concerns, such as sexual pathology,
the destructive effects of rampant
machismo, the blurring of fantasy
and reality, the disruptive status
of women in a male-dominated
culture, and the absurdity of the
religious life. Focusing on the films
Buñuel produced in Mexico and
Spain during the 1950s and 1960s,
Julian Daniel Gutierrez-Albilla
argues that Bunuel’s films that
there are multiple forms of identity,
subjectivity and sexuality present in
these films.
In his 70’s, Buñuel once told his
friend, novelist Carlos Fuentes: ‘I’m
not afraid of death. I’m afraid of
dying alone in a hotel room, with
my bags open and a shooting script
on the night table. I must know
whose fingers will close my eyes.’
He died in Mexico City, in 1983.
