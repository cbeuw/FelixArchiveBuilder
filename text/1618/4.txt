Imperial reflects on the
Paris attacks
continued from front page
One French student told FELIX,
“the only way we can stop this is by
winning the war. I wish countries
will [sic] send more help and
soldiers, showing french flags is
unfortunately not enough.”
An LSE graduate, Valentin Ribet,
perished in the attacks. He was
working for a law firm in Paris,
having earnt his business law degree
in 2014.
Imperial’s president, Alice Gast,
tweeted, “We mourn the loss of life
and condemn the violence in Paris
and we keep our students, staff,
alumni, friends and families in our
thoughts”. She also wrote to the
union’s French society expressing
condolence.
One Imperial student, Dan
Holloway, tweeted, “To people
blaming refugees for attacks in Paris
tonight. Do you not realise these are
the people the refugees are trying
to run away from..?” This has been
retweeted almost 80,000 times since
he posted it on Friday night.

Chinese professor dumped for dissidence
P
rofessor Liang Xinsheng
of Lingnan Normal
University has lost his
managerial position in light
of posts made on Weibo expressing
discontent over social issues. The
demotion has been widely seen
as a symptom of an increasing
crackdown on dissent in academia,
a crackdown led by China’s premier
Xi Jinping.
Professor Xinsheng was in the
midstofcompetitionfortheposition
of departmental deputy chair when
a rival colleague reported him for
posts containing ‘radical views’
made between 2012 and 2014, the
professor claims.This has led to him
being dropped from the managerial
staff in the university, as reported
by the South China Morning Post,
although he still retains his position
as professor. The case serves to
highlight the new wave of measures
being exerted in the by the Chinese
state following the distribution of a
government communiqué, dubbed
“Document Nine”.
The document is a response to
the perceived spread of dissent
in the country’s “public lectures,
seminars, university classrooms”

After a colleague reported his social media updates, he found
himself demoted from his management position
Dan said he’d had “harassment
and abuse” for the post afterwards
but that he was also “being told
(by people from every corner of
the globe) that I had perfectly
encapsulated what they wanted to
say”.
France’s president, Francois
Hollande, has mobilised 115,000
police and soldiers, as part of a huge
increase in security in the the French
capital, that has included several
hundred raids since the attacks. So-
called ‘Islamic State’ have claimed
responsibility.
David Cameron has announced
a “comprehensive strategy” for
dealing with ISIS, which he says
includes making the case for air
strikes on Syria. Parliament rejected
to join military strikes in Syria back
in 2013, but it is likely that there
will be another vote on the matter
soon.
Since the attacks, France has
launched air strikes on ISIS’
Syrian base in Raqqa. With the
US-led coalition, 30 airstikes
were conducted on Sunday night,
with more following in the week.
Reports on how many were injured
have been vague.
Last week George Osborne
announced, from the Imperial West
campus, plans to up the number of
spies in all three security agencies.
David Cameron has now reiterated
that he will increase staff numbers
15% and double the budget for
airline security.
GRACE RAHMAN
Imperial had
an intake
of around
370 French
students
last year
and the accompanying “infiltration”
of China’s “ideological sphere”
with liberal western ideas. Beyond
the wordy preface its message
to authorities and institutions is
summarized as such: tow the party
line,punish dissent.This suppression
has steadily intensified following
the appointment of President Xi
Jingping, who visited the UK and
Imperial College in late October.
While Mr. Jingping has been
hailed as an economic reformer,
his appetite for political reform
has been less than encouraging. As
reported by the Guardian, liberal
academics have been coming under
increasing pressure from the state
since his appointment in 2012.
This reflects a move back to a more
unilateral style of governance that
is less tolerant of free thinking. This
aggressive promotion of the party
message is evidenced by the Beijing
city government’s decision to spend
£20.3 million teaching Marxism in
the city’s universities.
Professor Xinsheng’s case has
garnered wide media attention,
despite government authorities
directing state media outlets not to
“hype” the story, as reported by the
China Digital Times. However, to
think that, given the last few years,
this case or its widespread coverage
will cause any reversal or relaxation
of these types of policies in perhaps
naïeve, and such policies may
continue to be implemented under
Xi Jingpeng’s leadership.
