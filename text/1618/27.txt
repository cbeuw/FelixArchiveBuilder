IC fail to curry favour, losing to Royal Holloway last week
I
mperial travelled to Royal
Holloway last Wednesday to
start what they hoped would
be a long cup run culminating
in some silverware. Falling on
Remembrance Day and being
followed by the club curry night,
there was a lot to play for to ensure
that IC got back on track after an
unmentionable loss to the medics
the week before.
Arriving at the venue to discover
that the game would be played on a
3G pitch, Coach Rich’s rousing pre-
match speech dispelled any notion
that this was in any way an excuse,
and saw IC make a solid start to
the game, dominating possession
and creating opportunities early on.
However, a lack of clinical finishing
saw the scoreline remain static until
sloppy play at the breakdown saw
a penalty go Holloway’s way just
inside IC’s half. This saw their one-
trick pony of a fly-half step up and
unleash his potent kicking ability to
put Holloway ahead.
Remaining calm, Imperial
responded instantly from the kick
off, securing possession straight
from the restart through great
pressure from Alex Clayton and
Hugh Wilman. This lead to a line-
out fifteen metres out from the as-
of-yet-unbreached opposition try
line. This called for the big guns to
come out, and the resulting move
was sweeter than the sweetest
of Peshwaris; slick hands from
the dummy mall saw a barrelling
run off the peel to finally wreck
the opposition line which had
maintained abstinence for far
too long. With the conversion
going wayward, at 5-3 the game
remained tighter than the average
Alex Calyton gym top; apparently
Mothercare make workout clothes
now.
Due to this, IC continued in the
same spirit as before, with centres
Chris MacBeth and Sam Moorby’s
hard lines off Charles Posh-Smith
punching regular holes in the
defence. Thanks to the unison of
the forward pods the team trundled
up the pitch and set the stage for
Moorby, who finished off a long
set of phases by blasting through
a “Receding” Holloway defence
to dot down over the line. Extras
added by CPS, Imperial seemed in
control. However, a late Holloway
penalty saw them stay within a
converted try as half time came with
IC leading 12-6.
However, even with the game
going to plan, as they say: it’s never
over until the fat lady sings, and it
seems that the mellifluous old gal
had only begun warming up her
vocal chords. Holloway came out
guns blazing in the second half, and
capitalised on some missed tackles
to score under the posts and take a
slender one-point lead. Aware that
they couldn’t allow the game to
slip away, IC knew that a madras-
tic change was needed, resulting
in local wasteman ‘Harry Styles
fresher’ being brought on at scrum
half. However, the One Direction
IC headed was backwards, as a
messy turnover at the scrum saw
Holloway run in a breakaway try
to extend their lead to a dangerous
eight points.
Imperial’s frustration was
beginning to overflow, which
became apparent in the next phase
as Russian fresher Ali Zaboronsky,
probably still fuming from his
country’s exclusion from the
Olympics, tackled an opposition
player clearly still in the air from the
restart. This resulted in an untimely
10 minute sin-bin as well as being
awarded DotD. With things
seemingly going from bad to worse,
IC captain Dave Nielson-Scott
rallied the team with a series of
hard-hitting runs,bhaji-ing through
the Holloway line and bouncing the
biggest plum pudding of a player
ever to set foot on a rugby field.
With the sin bin period expiring
and no more points conceded,
Imperial started stringing together
good phases of play, and edged
ever closer to scoring a try which
would put them within a score of
Holloway. Yet, as time ticked on,
the scoreline didn’t alter, long phase
plays and well formulated attacks all
succumbing to silly errors.
A sense of inevitability gripped the
team as they ruminated the thought
of defeat. Just as the heavenly
embrace of naan was coming,
a cruel twist of fate saw a rare
Holloway foray into IC territory
and uncharacteristic errors creep
into Imperial’s defence. Shortly
afterwards, insult was added to
injury as Holloway sent their winger
over in the corner to round off a 25-
12 upset. With hearts broken and
prides bruised, IC need to recover,
Tikka good long look at themselves
and bounce back next week in the
league to get their season back on
track.
