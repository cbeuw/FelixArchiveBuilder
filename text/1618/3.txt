Students across the country stage walkout
A
number of UK university
students have taken part
in mass walkouts, talks
and demonstrations as
part of a “day of solidarity” with
refugees. The students are acting
in protest of the government’s
mistreatment of refugees, along
with migrants and international
students.
The international campaign,
initiated by the National Union
of Students, was backed by the
University and College Union, the
academic workers’ union and the
National Campaign Against Fees
and Cuts.
A mock border control point was
set up by students at the London
School of Economics (LSE), who
intended it to show their support
‘for a world without borders’. The
students’ union at LSE suggested
that its members spent the day
carrying out charity work for

T
his week’s union council
meeting was rocked by
the tabling of a paper to
prevent the union from
lobbying its own members.
A difficult read in itself, the paper
proposes to ban the union from
lobbying its members in either
direction for general or by-elections,
or in national referenda, such as
the upcoming EU membership
referendum.
Despite proposing a constiutional
change that could massively impact
the role of the union in students’
lives, only members of union
council will be able to vote on the
matter.This includes officer trustees,
constituent union reps,management
group chairs and ordinary members,

Union Council will vote on whether to change its constitution
amongst others.
Despite being tabled at a union
council meeting last week the paper
was neither voted on or discussed
in particular detail, since quorum
wasn’t reached.
Traditionally one of the reasons for
a students’ union to exist, Imperial’s
union has a long history of voting
on stances and then lobbying both
students and parliament on their
behalf. In 2010 when fees were
due to rise, union council voted to
support the Browne review, and the
president wrote several damning
articles in FELIX as to why he
disagreed with the student protests
that were happening at the time.
This council paper doesn’t seek to
change the ability of the union to
lobby the government, but rather
would prevent the union from
lobbying its own students, whether
that be for the benefit of the union
or its members.
The proposal would not do away
with union-funded campaigns, but
demands that campaigns are equally
funded. Slightly more difficult
to police would be the paper’s
ammendment that two union-
funded campaigns would have to
be “presented with equal gusto”. It
also makes the point that the “lack
of a volunteer for one stance should
not mean a single union-funded
campaign goes ahead.
The union did not take a stance
during the recent general election
or the Scottish Independence
Referendum. No campaigns
supporting any voting stance were
funded.
Any member of the union (so

any Imperial student) can present a
paper to council, but only members
can vote on whether to pass them.
The paper will be discussed at the
next union council meeting, which
will be at 18:30 on December the 8th
in the Union Dining Hall. Anyone
can attend.

At the Royal College of Arts
(RCA), students took part in
a demonstration outside the
headquarters of the Daily Mail on
Kensington High Street in protest of
its strong anti-immigration stance.
RCA student union co-president
Miloslav Vorlíček said: “The Daily
Mail is noted for a long history of
anti-immigration headlines.”
“We hope to shine a spotlight on
this paper’s activities. Who knows,
we might even convince one or two
of its employees to walk away from
the dark side!”
Goldsmiths, University of
London, incorporated the day into
their refugee awareness month,
hosting an exhibition on asylum
seeking in the UK and a series of
panel discussions featuring students
from Syria and other war-torn areas
of the world.
Other universities whose students
took part in the day of solidarity
included Reading, Cardiff,
Manchester and Edinburgh.
Liverpool’s student union tweeted
the day before that it would “fully
support, endorse and encourage a
walk out from lectures”.
FELIX is not aware of any
students from Imperial who missed
lectures for the cause.
