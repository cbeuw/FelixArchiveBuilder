aste is true to the
name, a play about
dashed hopes and
broken dreams. It’s
a damnably English affair.
Banned in 1906, it has, in parts,
relaxed gently into middle age. The
back story – a political scheme to cut
the British church and state apart
– would struggle to move many
outside the back end of Belfast.

take as a brother a man who has
never known how to love. It’s very
careful work – to be strong in this
eggshell, pitiable kind of way, is a
hard balance to hold.
Above all, Waste reminds me of
two things. It’s a challenge not to
accept convention for convention’s
sake. Crucially, it’s a reminder
that we shouldn’t take change for
granted. Progress is not always
inevitable. Perhaps we have pushed
back some of Granville’s demons,
but the fact his words are still sharp,
living things today is warning
enough. Ultimately, he tells us , we
should not bind ourselves or turn
away from the truth. As Trebell,
that dead, broken idealist would say
– “The fear of life is the beginning
of all evil”.

tribalism that accompanies it. The
‘system’ is the only real character
ever on stage. Personal details
are irrelevant and the story arc is
obvious. It’s the crazy mechanics of
the political downfall that this play
speaks about. However, Waste is a
bemused caricature of a system of
double standards that is somehow
stable, but run on a completely
fake, theatrical morality. We come
away with a certainty, that to a man,
this is a cast of hypocrites. Trebell’s
executioners – a pluck of adulterers,
a pinch of monied holiness are as
guilty as he. Being right is simply a
case of not being caught.
In that sense, it’s as sharp today as
when the ink dried. Lord Horsham,
anxious and waiting, pale faced for
Mr. O’Conell could be Gordon
Brown on the night of the expenses
scandal – or Henry Trebell a Nick
Clegg of sorts (who was invited to
brooding sense of mortality to it.
As the play puts it, “Either life is
too little a thing to matter or it’s so
big that such specks of it as we may
be are of no account.” The effect is
marred only by some fairly clunky
screen transitions (blackouts in all
but name) that give the whole thing
a disconcerting hint of punch and
Judy. In theme maybe, but it’s a
killer for the pace.

motherly, bumbling sister to
Edward’s Trebell.A character which
could so easily become unbelievable
and fluffy – noise to be drowned
out by Trebell’s thunderous idealism

manages a set of wonderfully
balanced monologues. In the space

way that goes so lightly on the

But focusing on the setting and
the antics of our anti–hero, career
politician and cold–blooded atheist,
Henry Trebell (Charles Edwards),
would be a mistake.
The doomed relationship between
Trebell and the wily, married
Amy O’Conell (a sparkling Olivia
Williams) is a summary of the
plot – and a side note. His first and
last, it barely makes it beyond a one
night stand.
However, things roll along
smoothly enough from here – and
we follow the consequences of this
illicit affair, until Trebell is left a
purposeless, broken man.
That said, seeing Waste as just
another Victorian fable about the
ruin of idle sex would be as sloppy as
the backstreet abortion that exposes
our loveless couple. The real punch
of the comment here is the reverse.

Birth, death, and the messiness in between
Morgen und Abend throws us into a man’s existence, and beyond with mixed results

W
here words leave
off, music begins”,
said the poet
Heinrich Heine.
Morgen und Abend, a new opera by
Austrian composer Georg Friedrich
Haas, attempts to go where words
cannot and follows a man,Johannes,
into existence and beyond into
death. Although death (together
with love) is one of those ubiquitous
themes in opera, it is usually the act
of dying rather than the experience
of being dead. This opera then
promises a new kind of musical
experience.
Indeed, Morgen und Abend
is unlike anything you are likely
to have heard before, and at
key moments it is spectacularly
successful. As Johannes is born into
the world, it almost seems as if the
fabric of the universe is being pulled
and stretched, as if to accommodate
his new consciousness. Long
sustained notes, and glissandi in
the strings create hallucinogenic
textures, shifting between light and
dark. An unseen choir gives the
sense of something great occurring.
Although the orchestra produces
these soundscapes flawlessly, such
magical moments are heard only a
handful of times. As the plot seems
to concern itself with mundanities
for large stretches, the music often
feels reduced in its significance, or
even unnecessarily hefty.
As with the music, Fosse’s Joycean
script at times provides the pure
sensation of birth and death,
stuttering long strings of descriptive
words and noises to great effect.
But it is all too often distracted
by irrelevant details, attempting
to create logical consistencies
or perhaps just filling time. For
example; that Peter has been sent
back as Johannes’s best friend in
order to guide him into death adds
nothing to our understanding, and
in fact feels rather more like the
sort of supernatural explanation
found in a young adult novel. There
are deeper problems too. Though
titled “Morgen und Abend”,
morning and evening, the morning
scene depicting Johannes’s birth
is just a short introduction to the
interminably long evening in which
we watch as Johannes painstakingly
comes to understand what the
audience has long realised – that he
is dead.
Visually, we are presented with a
suitably minimal and grey tableau.
Important objects are strewn about:
a door, a bed, a fishing boat. These
are used sparingly, with a further
layer of symbolism being attached to
them each time.The door becomes a
gateway between worlds and times,
the boat on which he used to fish
becomes the vessel to carry him off.
We seem to be in a timeless space,
moving backwards and forwards
as we hop through the chronology
of Johannes’s memory. More use
could have been made of the visual
metaphors suggested in the text,
such as the ocean being the vast
realm of death – instead we are left

soundscapes
to imagine these against the white
backdrop on stage. One lighting
trick at the end really impressed
me, seemingly setting everything
on stage into relief as if in stone
and emphasising the permanence of
death.
The small cast of singers and actors
did very well in performing such
difficult music. In particular Sarah
Wegener, in the role of Signe, was
forced to grapple with microtones.
However, despite this, Morgen
und Abend doesn’t quite meet the
weight of its subject matter. A few
uniquely profound moments here
and there almost rescue the plot’s
strange occupation with more
mundane matters. For some, it may
be more interesting to read Ludwig
Wittgenstein’s ideas on death in the
programme notes. Perhaps better
for the Royal Opera to heed his
advice; “Whereof one cannot speak,
thereof one must be silent”.
