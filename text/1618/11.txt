Documentary corner: The Cove
Ben Collier
Writer

uch like Bowling
for Columbine, our
featured film of
last week, The Cove
stands as a masterful example of a
documentary with a message. A
renowned critical darling, the film
boasts countless awards, including
the Academy Award for ‘Best
Documentary Feature’. Despite
being heavily one-sided, it is a
near-perfect example of how to
produce an informative, campaign-
based documentary. While many
films of a similar vein often end
up incredibly dull and repetitive in
their preachiness,The Cove keeps the
viewer engaged, and has more than
just dry facts to keep us hooked.
The documentary covers, in
painful detail, the issue of dolphin
drive hunting and whaling in Japan.
More specifically, it focuses on an
isolated cove in Taiji where every
year thousands of dolphins are
captured and either taken to be
sold or slaughtered for meat. The
main character, of sorts, is seen
in Ric O’Barry who is famous for
training the dolphins featured in
the television series Flipper, but has
become somewhat of an eco-warrior
following a series of upsetting
experiences I won’t spoil here.What
gives this movie substance is the
almost Oceans Eleven-esque feel of
the narrative’s main driving force.
Much of the film is dedicated to
the crew’s efforts to covertly set
up surveillance around the bay
to record, for the first time, the
slaughter of these dolphins.
An expert team is put together
including an electronics professional
from the Canadian Air Force
and a Hollywood SFX artist who
disguises the cameras. The crew
is seen battling with intimidating
and relentless Japanese fishermen
who attempt to silence and scare
them away. The editing, music, and
camerawork all crescendo towards
the final act in what is a perfectly
crafted piece of suspenseful action
storytelling – when we do eventually
get to see the events of this cove,
it’s not easy to watch. Other parts
of the film go about explaining
various aspects of dolphin and
whale activism, with talking points
ranging from mercury poisoning,
captivity in SeaWorld, and the
Minamata-Disease scandal of the
1960s.
The Cove holds a place as one of
very few documentaries that have
made me question myself and the
things I believe and do. When
I first saw the film as part of a
showing with the Wimbledon Film
Club, the audience was treated to a
Q&A with a member of the Ocean
Protection Society. One topic that
came up during the discussion was
the question of how, if someone is
a meat-eater, could they oppose
the killing of these dolphins? This
question stuck with me then, and
has done so to this day. As a meat
eater myself, this film was genuinely
quite emotional and challenging to
watch; I would recommend it to
anyone interested in the topic, or
indeed any aspects of animal welfare
activism.

An exploration of the irrational
We head down to the opening night of the ICA’s Buñuel retrospective, where a
selection of his key films – Un Chien Andalou, Eating Sea Urchins, and L’Age D’Or –
display his mastery of the surreal
H
auntingly beautiful,
with no linear narrative,
no clear plot, and no
apparent meaning, the
films of Luis Buñuel mark him out
as a revolutionary director and key
figure in the avant-garde surrealist
movement. At the Institute of
Contemporary Arts (ICA) a
retrospective of his work and life,
begun with his most popular film,
Un Chien Andalou (1929), and his
most rare film, Eating Sea Urchins
(1930); a home-movie made at the
house of Buñuel’s close companion
and artistic partner Salvador Dalí’s,
it has been seen by relatively few.
The ICA, a small intimate venue
just five minutes from Piccadilly
Circus, “promotes and encourages
an understanding of radical art
and culture”. The fact they are
hosting a retrospective on one of
the most original filmmakers of all
time is therefore no surprise. The
retrospective, which commenced on
12th
November and took months to
put together, aims to cover all the
key periods of Buñuel’s expansive
body of films, and includes
panel discussions with acclaimed
academics, Jean Claude Carriere –
an Academy Award honoree and
frequent collaborator with Buñuel
– and Diego Buñuel, Luis Buñuel’s
grandson.
The opening was initiated with
Eating Sea Urchins; it was the first
time even the panelists had viewed
this extremely rare film, which
was found as recently as 1988 in a
biscuit tin at Dalí’s sisters house.
Made around the same time during
which Buñuel was making L’Age
D’Or (1930), it is a film wherein
the director has made his mark. As
Ingmar Bergman put it: “Buñuel
nearly always made Buñuel films”
and this is seen in the general
direction and use of recurring
themes such as the sea urchin,which
also appears in Un Chien Andalou.
This was a point the panelists
focused on, Jo Evans stating how it
was hard to watch it having seen its
role in Un Chien Andalou.
Then it was onto probably the most
popular of Buñuel’s films: Un Chien
Andalou. Buñuel created the film
on the basis that “no idea or image
that might lead itself to a rational
explanation of any kind would be
accepted.”The film,laced with a dark
humour typical of Buñuel’s films,
sews together almost completely
nonsensical scenes with trivial links
and contains iconic scenes, such as
the slitting of the eye in half, which
still has the power to shock. Given
our desensitised society, and the
time at which the film was made,
it is rather incredible. The film was
intended to be an insult to the
French bourgeoisie, but instead –
frustratingly for Buñuel – turned out
to be a commercial success. Being
accepted by the masses put him at
odds with his intended audience –
the likes of Andre Breton and other
surrealists – but not excessively,
since on completion Luis Buñuel
and co-writer Salvador Dalí became
the first filmmakers to enter the
surrealist group founded by Breton.
Finally the feature film L’Age
D’Or was screened, wherein you
can really see the comic in Buñuel:
brilliantly funny, the film has a
strong satirical undertone that
cannot be missed. Following the
failed attempts of two lovers to
achieve intimacy, it was Buñuel’s
take on the absurdities of the
bourgeois society, and how society
is oppressed by rules we ourselves
created. Every scene connected
to the next with subtle ties, slowly
increasing in ridiculousness that
reached an apex near the end when
the male protagonist, overtaken
with immense jealousy, throws
inscrutable items out of the window.
This rage is then compared to the
damnably sinful, as the film cuts to
a disturbing reference to de Sade’s
notorious 120 Days of Sodom –
the survivors are shown exiting
the castle, with one survivor, the
Duke of Blangis, bearing a striking
resemblance to Jesus Christ.
Make of that what you will, but I
personally am intrigued enough for
a second watch.
“Students come here not
expecting them to be so funny”
Rob Stone exclaimed. And I agree
– I was taken aback the first time I
saw Buñuel. There is a tendency for
directors and films associated with
an art movement as nonsensical
as surrealism to be considered
pretentious and as something
meant for a film thesis, but Buñuel
is genuinely entertaining. Get a
taste of Buñuel’s satirical surrealism
at the ICA, and even if you end
up hating Buñuel, at least you’ll
have watched a film in a charming
venue. “The best way is to relax, get
the humour, and go along with the
black comedy. Rather than trying
to analyse and try and work out the
meaning for it.” Stone continued,
“Embrace it, and see what happens
next!” – wise words.
