igger, better and even
more critical. Welcome
to the all-new, expanded
Demo Dump. One voice
is no longer enough, so this week I
grabbed anyone and everyone who
stumbled into the FELIX office and
forced them to listen to the demos
you sent in.
We’ve had submissions from
across Imperial this week: maths
freshers, second year chemists and
even someone doing an MSc in
Neurotechnology (what a clever
bunch). Anyone you sit next to in a
lecture could be a secret,moderately-
good musician.
If you haven’t sent your demos
in yet, please do! Even if it isn’t
that great, we’ll try to be as nice
as possible (we often like to give
contrasting opinions). And if it’s
good, we’ll probably still be mean,
but at least someone will have
listened to your music.

This week’s anonymous guest
critic had a lot to say about Cylink
and his EP Dreams. I’m not sure all
of it was fair.
D’annyG provides clean vocals on
‘We Don’t Stop’ which turn a well-
produced (but rather predictable)
deep house track into something
special.
‘Peace of Mind’, on the other
hand, is brilliantly cinematic. It’s a
massive contrast to the other tracks
on the EP, and I’m not sure how
well it fits in.
‘Dreams feat. Kefei Hu’ is bold
and bombastic, an absolute banger.
‘Basskick’ is a bit too over the top,
following many of the tropes of the
house genre. Cylink has tagged his
music as ‘Progressive House,’ and
this is the track least worthy of this
description. It’s a poor attempt at
making a club-worthy anthem.
After listening to ‘We Don’t Stop
feat. D’annyG’, my guest critic
dived deep into their past: “This
one time I took an overnight ship
from Grimsby to the Hook of
Holland and it was only, like, old
people on board. I went into the
sort of nightclub bit and it was
us that “If ‘Basskick’ was released
seven years ago when I was like 14
or 15, I would have banged it out. It
would have genuinely been my jam.”
It looks like Cylink now has a fan.

‘Epilogue’ is an ambient, jazzy
single. It starts of as simple chill-
step, with a synth undulating in the
background. At about the minute
mark, a cheesy sampled saxophone
comes in and the track begins to
open up. It gently relaxes back into
the ambient tones of the beginning,
with soft piano chords, before
climaxing once again with a cheeky
sax.
While it may be little rough
around the edges, it’s still a good
effort and perfect for a chilled night
in. Pick up a beer (or other alcoholic
beverage of your choice), and sit
back and chill with ‘Epilogue’.
One voice in the FELIX office was
Oebus
It’s all looking up for Oebus..
After a touring the campus over
the last year (even playing a gig in
Metric), they now find themselves
in the pages of FELIX.
A few weeks ago they released
their alt-funk-rock EP, It’s an Oebus.
I’ll forgive the flat production,
because their music is seriously
groovy.
A few weeks ago I reviewed the
new Guitar Hero (you should read
I would have
banged
it out. It
would have
genuinely
been my
jam
just completely empty. I had a free
drinks token so I went a got a beer
and this sounds like the sort of
music that was on loop.”
On ‘Piece of Mind’ they said
“This one’s alright, I would listen to
this.” At this point I told my guest
to move onto the next artist, but
they insisted on listening to more.
Apparently, if ‘Dreams feat. Kefei
Hu’came on in the club “(he) would
most definitely turn up.”
For what?
Reminiscing once again, they told
It’s all
looking up
for these
guys,
they’ve even
played a gig
in Metric
Next week this could be your demo!
A cheesy
sampled
saxophone
comes in
and the
track begins
to open up
less kind: “There were odd chords, a
weird dissonance, which came out
of the blue in a not pleasant to listen
to way.”

FELIX’s game section once in a
while, it’s great), and many of their
songs provide the catchy and skilled
guitars that would be perfect for the
game.
I enjoyed ‘Hazard Perception’ the
least out of the four tracks; their
attempt at singing along with the
beat of the bass guitar and drums
felt far too forced.
Give them a year or two and
they’ll be great.
Mystery guest number two said
this about the EP: “It’s sounds like
someone is trying to imitate Jack
White, but is 19.” I’m not really
sure what he meant.

Last year Mentality and Imperial College Union worked together to
conduct research to identify the levels of stress and causes of poor
mental health.
The results of the survey confirmed that there are high-levels of
stress at Imperial and that poor mental health is commonplace.
As part of the recommendations of the report we are already
seeing widespread changes being implemented across the
training, including a redesign of Imperial’s Welfare website, and a
review of Student Support Services as well as an increase in the
services being provided in some areas.
Imperial College Union wants to support students to be able to support their friends and classmates. As part of this we are offering Mental Health First Aid Lite
training. The training will give students the skills to identify the discrimination surrounding mental health issues, define mental health and some
common mental health issues, relate to people’s experiences and look after your own mental health.
The training would usually cost £30, but Imperial College Union is contributing to subsidise the training to just £12. To find out more and book your space go to:

We are looking into launching an app for your phone and we need your help.
More and more of you are accessing our website using your mobile phone or
tablet and, whilst we are working on making our website more mobile friendly,
we also want to talk to you all about what you might want from a Union app.
We have some ideas already, but what we really want is for you to let us know
what you would want. We also want your feedback as to how we should make
the app. We know there budding developers out there who might want to help
us out!
Let us know what you would want from a Union app at:

In the footsteps of the London Climate Forum, we have planned an exciting
lineup of interactive workshops and talks that will give you the opportunity to
engage with our speakers.
Leading thinkers from politics, academia, industry, think tanks and social
movements will come together to present their innovative approaches to the
climate change issue.
