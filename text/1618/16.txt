What went down at Dreamland?
F
oals are one of the most
legendary live bands of
this generation in music.
A bold statement, perhaps,
but I honestly believe that to be the
truth.
Travelling down to Margate on a
wet day in November might seem
odd, but the weirdest part of Foals’
new live experience was that it was
played at Dreamland, a theme park
on the coast.
Going on a few rides before
the concert was a lot of fun (with
the park only open to gig-goers);
however, we were really here to see
Foals.
Having headlined Alexandra
Palace almost two years ago, they
were returning to a much smaller
venue, a roller disco room, to
promote their new album. Opening

with ‘Snake Oil’,the crowd excitedly
opened up a mosh pit. As the drum
beat came in, it felt like a boxing
match. Ding ding, round five.
The mosh pits stayed active
throughout the gig, with the energy
of the crowd and the band never
lapsing. Even calmer songs, such as
‘Blue Blood’from Total Life Forever,
caused mass singalongs with the
entire crowd screaming along.
‘Give It All’ slowed things down.
Some bands put in slower and more
melodic songs to make the crowd
think later songs are heavier. Foals
do not; they do so to prevent the
crowd fainting from the madness.
‘Providence’ from Holy Fire was
a particular highlight for me. The
crowd went mad, and an audience
member even chipped a tooth.
The gig calmed down again with
one of Foals’greatest songs,‘Spanish
Sahara’; a melodic masterpiece
which continued to bring the crowd
closer together. The band really
showed their skill with frenzy-
inducing solos.
It was beautiful as the whole

stage her own, pouring
every part of herself into her singing,
lyrics and production.
The ICA often plays host to
multidisciplinary artists, but TĀLĀ
has honed a single craft, the ability
TĀLĀ live at ICA
to reconstruct an electronic song
single-handedly live on stage.
There may have been some trickery
behind the scenes; regardless,
TĀLĀ showed how one woman can
dominate a space and captivate an
audience.
On her numerous EPs she explores
pop music to its fullest. There are
clear similarities to M.I.A., but
TĀLĀ doesn’t let this define her.
She’s more influenced by her own
Iranian heritage than by the music
of her contemporaries.
As only her second live show, it
was all the more impressive.Leaving
the stage smiling, it was obvious
that TĀLĀ was pleased with her
performance.

t’s rare to find a band with
such mesmerising on-stage
chemistry. Last Tuesday at
Electric Brixton, MS MR
brought their dynamic live show to
London.
Lead singer Lizzy Plapinger’s
genuine excitement was evident in
her sweat and tears; her presence
put the audience in a state of awe.
It was difficult not to gaze at her as
she sparkled across the stage in her
glittery playsuit.
With performances that are as
energetic as this, it’s forgiveable
that the vocals are drowned out
and breathy. The catchy synths and
bombastic drums were a little more
pleasing than Plapinger’s middling
vocals. But when compared to the
recorded versions, many of the
songs felt messy.
Only the best can balance a bold
stage presence with an excellent
live sound. Unfortunately, MS MR
aren’t quite there yet.
crowd sang, not just to the band
but to each other. People hugged
and emotion of the audience was
overwhelming.
eleven songs and they were gone.
Obviously, they returned for an
encore. Dedicated to anyone who
“won anything in the roulette shop.”
‘London Thunder’ from the new
album was played with more punch
than on the record, with Yannis
Philippakis (lead singer, guitarist)
initially playing solo.
Foals finished with two of their
heaviest songs: starting with the
title track from What Went Down.
Yannis crowdsurfed while still
playing guitar, returned to the stage,
and then went in again for another
go.The crowd greeted Yannis almost
like a messiah.
‘Two Steps, Twice’ built up slowly
over eight minutes. The crowd was
still wild, only now beginning to
tire. Yannis had gone to the bar
with his guitar, downing a shot in
the process. The crowd reaches its
climax and the concert finishes. Not
one person left without a smile on
their face.
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it
again: Foals are quite possibly the
best live band in the UK.

all the way up to, and including,
‘Inhaler’ from Holy Fire. The crowd
danced and moshed harder than
before. The band let rip with their
instruments more than they had
before. And then they left the stage;
