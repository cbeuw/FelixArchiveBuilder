Don’t give criminals a chance!
Smartphones contain valuable information and are at risk from
thieves, viruses and malware attacks. But many lack basic
security measures.
What to do:
• Use a PIN to restrict access
• Only install apps from trusted app stores
(e.g. Google Play, Windows Store & App Store)
• Always keep your smartphone safe
Make sure you are protected. For more guidance to protect
