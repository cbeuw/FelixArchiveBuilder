France must change
One French student says the divisions to blame are ingrained

A
s a French national,
the events of the 13th
of November in Paris
were a dagger through
my heart. It capped off a tragic year
for our country. The Charlie Hebdo
January attacks came as a shock,
but the stabbing of three soldiers in
February followed by the attacks of
last Friday have exposed the serious
political crisis within our nation.
With the rise of Islamist radicals
in the world, it pains me to say that
these catastrophes on our soil were
inevitable. The middle-eastern wars
since the beginning of this century
have fed extremism,but I believe the
specific threat to France stems from
the accumulation of our political
frailties. I will explain myself.
In the 19th
and 20th
century, France
was a colonialist power, notably
‘possessing’ territories in North
Africa. The end of the violent
Algerian War of Independence
in 1962 marked the end of this
era, leading to mass immigration
(notably Muslims) to France.
It brought diversity and new
talent to the country, but it also
enhanced inequalities in major
cities. Gradually, a ‘stereotypical’
picture was being drawn as some
of the immigrants from ex-colonies
were being segregated into poorer
districts. It is very important to
clarify that many immigrants
integrated very well and succeeded.
As a consequence, as years have
gone by, the economic alienation of
some of these populations, blended
with the discriminatory mind-
set towards them instilled since
the colonial period, have swirled
France into an unwanted cultural
segregation.
This has posed modern-day issues
regarding the integration of some
of the Muslims from these tougher
areas, who are born in our country,
and descend from immigrant
families. How can they be
patriotic when they are sometimes
discriminated against, and have
the feeling that the government
is not helping them escape their
impoverished circumstances?
In 2004, a law in our country
was adopted that prohibits any
form of visible religious signs in
public schools. Hence, women
cannot wear the headscarf in an
academic environment. Before the
1980s, there was no such debate in
France; the Kippah, for example,
could be worn in schools without
a problem until then. However, the
emergence of a large community of
Muslims led to this law being voted.
This clearly is a stigmatisation
towards this community, and a
political contradiction to the “open-
mindedness towards religion” stated
in our 1958 Constitution.Therefore,
some of them do not feel welcomed
in our country.
The lack of effort from the
government to dampen this identity
crisis clearly feeds the potential
for extremism. Indeed, some
psychologically vulnerable Muslims
are more likely to be radicalisation
targets of Islamist groups.
That is why I think last Friday’s
attacks show the necessity for
France to change. The fact that
a lot of the terrorists guilty of the
2015 atrocities are French nationals
shows this identity frailty within
our nation. We must adapt and
fight to create unity and respect
between our different cultures. It is
true that we need to react abroad to
counter the ISIS threat, but there
is also a philosophical battle within
our borders. How do we promote
the integration of these vulnerable
Muslims, and inhibit the rise of
French-born terrorists?
I believe France must change its
education system: we must allow
religious signs in schools, and
therefore allow the headscarf to be
worn. Also, we must instil from a
very young age the important values
of our Republic. I was educated in
the French system, but I find that
our famous motto “Liberty,Equality
and Fraternity” was not stressed
enough. We must insist on it in
schools, and exhibit the beauty of a
free democratic country.
Finally, I believe that forcing a
military service would harmonise
the different cultures within our
nation. These are my opinions, but
whatever the changes that are to be
made, they need to be concretised
quickly. It will take generations to
create this craved unity in France,
but it is essential if we are to win the
war on terror we are facing.
