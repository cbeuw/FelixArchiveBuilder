Imperial mourns
S
everal hundred people
gathered at the foot of
Queen’s Tower on Monday
for a minute’s silence to
remember the 129 people killed
in the Paris attacks. The crowd
included students and staff, who
joined a Europe-wide moment
of reflection three days after the
tragedy.
Students paused at 11am, and
after a minute of reflection returned
to their daily activities. In Paris,
crowds converged at the Louvre,
Eiffel Tower as well as beneath the
make-shift memorial at the Place de
la République.The French President,
Francois Hollande, observed the
minute’s silence amongst students
at Paris-Sorbonne university, where
three victims of the attack were
studying.
Imperial had an intake of around
370 French students last year,
making them the second biggest
group from abroad, after the
community of Chinese students.

Junior doctors vote to strike in December
O
n Thursday it was
announced that junior
doctors had voted
overwhelmingly to take
action against proposed contract
changes, with 98% voting to take
strike action and 99.4% in favour of
industrial action short of striking.
The first proposed strike is
scheduled for Tuesday 1st
December
and would see junior doctors only
staff emergency care. The two
subsequent strikes proposed would
take place on Tuesday 8th
December
and Wednesday 16th
December, and
would be full junior doctor walkouts.
Medical students have been warned
by ICSM that due to strike action
laws it would be illegal for them to
join the picket lines.
The BMA have stated that the
strike dates are only provisional
and that they are “keen to avert
the need for industrial action” and
to this end have approached the
arbritration service ACAS to act as
an intermediate between them and
Hunt.
The BMA balloted almost 38,000
of its members, representative of
two-thirds of junior doctors in
the UK, and 76% of these decided
to voice their opinion on the
government’s proposed plans to
alter which times in the working
week classify as “unsociable” and
hence qualify for increased pay.
Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt,
has attempted to counteract this by
giving an 11% increase in basic pay
but this still means that the doctors
working extra hours will actually be
paid less due to the reclassification.
Doctors also argue the measures
will increase risk to patients as they
will be obligated to work longer
hours atop an already demanding

mistakes occurring to increase.
Med Harris, the ICSMSU
President told FELIX, “As medical
students we cannot strike with the
doctors but we will be showing our
support for the junior doctors on
the day!”
Imperial College Union’s Deputy
President for Welfare, Jennie
Watson,who is also a medic,said she
was “thrilled to see such a large turn
out” and that the union “extends its
full solidarity with junior doctors
and we will do everything possible
to support our medic membership”.
“Personally, I plan to leave after
I finish medical school if these
contract changes are forced upon
us,” she added.
