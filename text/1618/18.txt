O
h Jamie, you can do
no wrong. Not in my
eyes, the eyes of anyone
who went outdoors this
summer who was inundated with
your invariably uplifting ‘Good
Places’ was your track of Summer
‘15, ‘Crystallised’ will always be the
song you lost your virginity to.
This album, catchy though it is,
was inconsistent, but when the best
stuff is this good, it doesn’t matter.
As Jamie’s first length solo record,
it was a masterpiece in execution of
a wide-spread appeal, boys in ironic
Adidas, white people at carnival
vibe. Which isn’t bad; white people
can go to carnival. Maybe the fact
that any song on the album could
quite comfortably be the backing
track on your GoPro filmed gap yah
video montage is a good thing.
His sampling of old rave vids, the
notable downer on some tracks and
lack of lyrics on others, makes for
an album you just turn up Spotify’s
twelve second fade option on, and
play all night. ‘Obvs’ and its joyful
rooftop steel drums as folks arrive,
‘Good Times’ as the party heats
up, the ethereal ‘The Rest Is Noise’
as the hangers on refuse to leave,
and his xx bandmate Romy’s ‘Loud
Places’ as a kind of hipster ‘Mr
Brightside’that you all sing along to
before collapsing or going home. It
really is an album of the people.

laves’ Are You Satisfied?
getting nominated for a
Mercury Prize is pretty
weird, but then the
Tunbridge Wells garage rock two-
piece Slaves are far from ordinary.
Playing dirty basements only a
couple of years ago, Slaves have
since experienced massive success
that their contemporaries (such as
Hookworms and the sorely missed
Wet Nuns) can only marvel at,
headlining large dirty clubs and
weirdly signing to Virgin EMI (but
then not every band can release a
massive hit single like “Where’s
Your Car Debbie”).
The appeal of Slaves’ debut album
is pure fun. Dirty, spiky guitar riffs
swirl amongst simple drumming
punctuated by shouty Frank Carter-
esque (post Gallows) vocals. The
choruses to all the songs show
great gang vocals adding to the
cheek lyrics. Sure, this album’s not
wall-to-wall bangers, but it is about
three songs too long (and that’s
being kind) with songs like ‘She
Wants Me Now’ and ‘Wow!!!7AM’
really falling short. Let’s be honest,
a band playing sloppy garage rock is
never going to be consistent.
This album is a worthy winner of
the Mercury Prize.The album is fun
and doesn’t take itself too seriously;
it’s easily the best release this year
from the British rock scene (on this
short list at least). This award could
go to some obscure arty album, but
where would the fun be in that?
F
rom the depths of the
deep web, Aphex Twin
returned in late 2014 with
Syro. 138 separate pieces
of equipment come together, all
in absolute harmony, to create an
single soundscape. Nothing ever
feels auxiliary or out of place.
it never sounds as dark), but it feels
more like a throwback. Which isn’t
surprising given that the album was
recorded over a number of years.
Seamlessly shifting from one track
to another, Syro morphs between
sub-genres in over 64 minutes of
music. From ambient to glitch and
techno, all are executed expertly.
‘minipops 67 [120.2][source field
mix]’was the first Aphex Twin track
in 13 years, and it starts off the
album with twinkling piano notes
and disorientating vocals.
The wonky synths of ‘produk 29
[101]’ overlay a plodding bass while
a ghostly female voice jabbers “Like,
we were at that club / Fucking
house / Disgusting / Needy slut /
Fucking whore.” Although oddly
disturbing, it’s just one of many
weird vocal samples on the album.
The razor-sharp ‘s950tx16wasr10
[163.97][earth portal mix]’ (at this
point in the tracklist the titles are
unpronounceable) bounces from
acid to jungle, wobbling your mind
in the process.
It’s surprising that not a single
record from his expansive career
has ever been nominated for the
award. Yet no figure has been more
influential in modern electronic
music. Syro proves that even after
years of hiding in the shadows, no
one can craft music as intelligently
and flawlessly as Aphex Twin.
F

summer, and it rocketed to

the nicest singing you’ve ever
heard. That’s what you should
expect from this album. Lots of
critics have complained about the

an indie vibe.
I’ve looked hard for one, but there
isn’t a flaw with her performance.
Like I mentioned earlier, the only
criticism that actually lands is
about the instrumentation. C’mon.
It’s the Mercury Awards. Not to

acclaimed early work was probably

something.
At the end of the day, the vocals

M
urphy has exercised
what seems to be
complete creative
control over the
project, extending even to the music
videos, an achievement that is no
mean feat; each beat seems precisely
in the right place, each guitar riff
timed to complete perfection. And
yet dangerous emotional currents
lie beneath the calm surface. Like
someone trying to hold things
together following a personal crisis,
there is the sense that Hairless Toys
could come crashing down at any
minute.
Murphy affords us precious
few insights into this maelstrom,
but there are moments where the
mask slips: ‘Uninvited Guest’, a
funky number reminiscent of early
Grace Jones, spirals out of control,
the base groove unravelling into
a dreamy whispered sequence,

the end: during ‘Unputdownable’,
where Murphy compares a lover to a
favourite book, the chilly synths and
claves are suddenly cut through with
a burst of acoustic guitar,completely
blindsiding us. It’s a sign that, even
after 50 minutes of Hairless Toys
and 20 years in the business, Roisin
Murphy has not lost the power to
surprise. ‘And when at last I turn
to the end/I turn back to page one
and again/pour over every word’she
sings – a perfect attitude towards
this remarkable album,one to return
to, again and again.
T
his four-piece grunge
rock band from North
London splashed onto
the music scene back in
2013 with a fresh sound described
as the love child of folk and grunge.
Their unique combination saw
them release a number of successful
their debut studio album My Love Is
Cool,reaching a peak of number two
in the UK album charts. The album
has received positive reviews and
features chart topping singles.
To reach where they are presently,
Wolf Alice have come far in a
relatively short span of time. From
their early folky acoustic style, they
have transformed into an off-kilter
rock band, incorporating post-
grunge themes.
Ever-present on the UK tour
and festival scene, they deliver
solid performance after solid
performance, mesmerising crowds
with the soothing voice of lead
singer Ellie Rowsell. Lulling their
audiences into a false sense of
indie-cradled security, the band
then swerve into a ruthless and
unanticipated riff-filled thrash pop
hell.
This kind of unpredictability is
rare and ever increasingly desirable
in new music,which is why My Love
Is Cool has done so well achieving
this Mercury Prize nomination.
Not only is the music of Wolf
Alice a new and unique fusion,
but the band itself is a flag-waving
spearhead for new upcoming British
bands.
It only makes sense that this young
and vibrant quartet are awarded the
2015 Mercury Music Prize.

The flabbergasting combo of Jamie
Smith, dance hall A-lister Popcaan,
Young Thug and The Persuasions’
‘Good Times’ made for a track
that has the gusto to support the
whole album, and potentially win
Jamie the prize. When some of the
original Persuasions members heard
the sampled track, on hearing lines
like Thug’s ‘I’m-a ride that pussy
like a stroller’, one exclaimed, “wow,
times have changed, man!” but they
still expressed a desire to perform at
energy and live feel of the album.
Minimalism is a prevailing theme
throughout, which adds to the
playful (but slightly aggressive)
attitude. The riffs are distorted and
uncomplicated whilst the drums are
sparse and tribal.The lyrical content
follows the same theme; you’ll find
no over-complicated or pretentious
lyrics from the twin vocalists here,
just shouty calls to dance.

completely subsumed, the lyrical

of icy sound. But like a Baroque

regain control, ending on a note of
harmony. From dissonance comes
