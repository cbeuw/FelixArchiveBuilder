In connection with the I L E A a unique
series of programmes were produced. In
M a r c h 1978 S T O I C transmitted a pilot news
programme called London Lunchbreak,
which was based on ICs programme
Lunch Break. T h e programme was s h o w n
on the I L E A ' s channel seven network and
was broadcast live. N e v e r in the history
of the network had a live progamme been
broadcast. A l l of its output was either
t a p e or film. T h e t h o u g h t of a live
programme from one of its studios took
the I L E A T V service slightly aback. A live
p r o g r a m m e p e r h a p s â€” but m a d e by
students? T h e programme was even able
t o b o a s t t h e a p p e a r a n c e of B a r r y
N o r m a n , who arrived only just in time. A
series of six programmes were produced
by S T O I C for transmission on the I L E A
network, which prior to its closure last
year linked over 1,000 schools and 95
colleges of higher education in L o n d o n . In
fact t h e biggest c l o s e d c i r c u i t c a b l e
network in Europe!
The current series of news programmes
in Imperial College now go under the
banner of News Break and are broadcast
e v e r y T h u r s d a y at o n e o ' c l o c k a n d
repeated at six o'clock the same day.
Variety is the spice of.
The last ten years of S T O I C have been
condensed into a fifty minute programme
c a l l e d Happy Birthday To Us!. T h e
programme is presented by David G h a n i
and follows S T O I C from its first programme
in 1970, through its ups and downs to the
present day. Happy Birthday To Us will be
shown on Tuesday 19th February at one
o'clock with a repeat at six.
Involvement with S T O I C has enabled
m a n y s t u d e n t s to e n t e r the field of
broadcasting as a career. M a r k Caldwell
recently w o r k e d on B B C T V ' s Film '80 and
is now with Barry T o o k on Points Of View.
E x - S T O I C m e m b e r s a r e w o r k i n g for:
Thames, L o n d o n W e e k e n d , and Anglia T V ,
as well as several more in B B C T V and
Radio.
If you have been interested by this article

the activities, then either c o m e into the

evenings from 4:30pm till late, w h e n Neujs
Break is being recorded.
W i t h the recent updating of the college
T V Studio's equipment, S T O I C is now
able to show some of its progammes in
colour, although the first S T O I C colour
recording was made in 1976 w h e n G l e n d a
J a c k s o n was interviewed. O n l y last term
w a s this i n t e r v i e w a c t u a l l y s h o w n in
colour for the first time.
The complications involved in producing
a typical interview are huge. S T O I C needs
t h e f o l l o w i n g p e r s o n n e l : t w o s t u d i o
c a m e r a m e n , o n e floor m a n a g e r , o n e
caption cameraman, one videotape suite
editor, one sound m a n , one vision engineer,
one director/vision mixer and finally one
interviewer. A total of nine people to get the
interview on the air. W h e n S T O I C mounts
its annual marathon of live coverage of the
hustings and election meetings later this
Another satisfied couple
month this figure will double. A s last year,
the election programme will be produced in
cooperation with I C Radio. S T O I C will
mount the programme, both in the studio
and G r e a t Hall and an IC Radio presenter
will join S T O I C for the day to provide a
summary every ten minutes, this being
taken by IC Radio live on air. T h e event
seems trivial but technically it is the most
ambitious ever taken o n by S T O I C . Split
second timing to enable I C Radio to take an
insert spot o n queue is no mean feat!
All in all S T O I C is trying to provide the
most complete T V service for IC students.
W i t h the recent connection of Linstead Hall
T V Lounge, S T O I C ' s coverage is almost
complete, only G a r d e n and W e e k s Halls
remain.
