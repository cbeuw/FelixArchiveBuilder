IC 3rds vs Thames Valley: 5—1
Last Saturday, IC thirds (well, mostly
thirds) played in the manner to which
they would like to be accustomed. Do I
hear two-one? No they cry, five-one or
T o n y G r e i g w o u l d have s a i d : " W e
made them grovel". Moving as if the
oilfields of the Persian Gulf were at
their mercy, the well-oiled forward Ifne
drilled a gaping hole in the Thames
Valley to begin a veritable deluge that
saw their opponents' hopes go down
the drain. After two minutes, Steve
Wriggley riddled his way through the
defence to score. Minutes later, Jim
Ebner found himself twenty-five yards
out with only the goalkeeper to beat
and, in a moment of extreme rashness,
scored, and put himself on the road to

dampened IC's now soaring spirits by
s c o r i n g . R e c o g n i s i n g this blatant
example of ungentlemanly conduct (in
view of the fact that the thirds had just
got used to playing on a pitch with
grass and proper markings instead of
contour lines, ie the match was at

shattered the o p p o s i n g d e f e n c e to
leave the goalkeeper wishing, in vain,
that he was Dave Moynham.
For the second half, IC swopped the
advantage of Neil Mason's umpiring
for his greater skill in persuading our
opponent's key man to try his hand at
umpiring. Incidentally, Robyn Morgan
hereby apologises for the appalling
low quality of IC's fourth goal which
w a s an i n e x c u s a b l e e x a m p l e of
opportunism and would not have an
allowed to mar an otherwise unblem-
ished performance had it not improved
the g o a l d i f f e r e n c e . C h r i s B i r d
attempted to improve upon Kentucky
Fried Chicken by making the Chip of
the Y e a r ; u n f o r t u n a t e l y , he w a s
outside the ' O ' at the time and so only
the vision of what may have been
remains. G o r d o n wylie staked his
cliam for a place in the team with a
w e l l - t i m e d run leadint to IC's fifth
goal.
Altogether, this was a performance
of such polish, one regrets to have put
it down to wearing clean, dry, cotton
shirts instead of thsoe nasty, damp
nylon ones.
IC F O O T B A L L : H A R D L U C K LADS
I would like to thank all those who played for the
seconds last Saturday in the semi-final. Unfortunately
it just wasn't our day. Special thanks is due to the
vociferous support given by a small band of hardy
supporters, who even with a defeat turned the whole
day into a memorable occasion. May I also take this
opportunity to wish the fourths the best of luck for
the replay against K C H 2 (if the game was played
Wednesday I hope they won).
Cheers, Phil.

O n Thursday 7th February, IC firsts
had their first m a t c h for the U L U
league, first d i v i s i o n . T h e y p l a y e d
against St Mary's Hospital at the U L U
swimming pool in Malet Street.
Mary's started the game with a lot of
enthusiasm and managed to score a
goal in the first minute. However, the

quarter, after taking the ball from Phil
Mills.
In the second and third quarters IC
dominated the game, scoring one goal
in each quarter. Pat Porter and Nick
Last were playing creatively midpool
and our attack was working efficiently.
Barry passed the ball to Phil Thwaites

second goal with a lob over the goal
keeper's head. Phil Mills scored our
third goal with a long shot from a very
difficult angle. The ball hit the near

In the -fourth quarter Mary's put all
their effort to equalise, but our goalie.

chance. He made three magnificent
saves, two of them from shots from
the two yards line! Just before the end
of the game Nick Buckland attempted
a hard shot and their goalie saved it,
but the ball went in front of Phil
Thwaites, who literally swam into the
goal with it, to make the final score 4-
1 to IC. It was a clear win for us and
we fully deserved it.

TOUR MATCH EXCLUSIVE:
IC Ladies Rugby vs Magor
Maidens: 4—4
This was the Welsh team's second
match of the weekend and proved to
be a hard but friendly occasion and
provided us with the best ladies rugby
we have yet seen. IC went soon down
to fourteen players when 'Stinker'
Wilton had to leave the pitch due to
i l l n e s s . C o r n e t t o ( S i l v a n a ) s o o n
followed her off with a limp wrist but
was revitalised enough to return after
ten minutes.
In the scrums 'Happy Hooker' Babs
was magnificent, taking about eighty
percent of the opposition ball although
they were sometimes driven off it by a
well drilled Magor pack. In the backs
Magor showed superior organisation
and, with some excellent kicking from
the fly half, put IC u n d e r s o m e
pressure. This led to a try for them
The results of the first team over the
past three weeks have been crucial
a n d s u c c e s s f u l , (thank G o d , A l l a h ,
Mao, Buddha). First they defeated the
seconds by the narrow margin of five
sets to four, then Gainsford 8-1, and
finally the only remaining threat to
t h e i r d i v i s i o n four c h a m p i o n s h i p
hopes, I N C O by nine sets to nil!
This means that they have an almost
i n s u r m o u n t a b l e lead, a n d the c u p
should be ours! (The first trophy for
IC in recent years.)
T h e s e c o n d s ( s e e a b o v e ) a l s o
defeated Sarah Siddons 7-2 to stay
comfortably in the middle of the table.
O f the l o w e r t e a m s , the t h i r d s
continued their relentless pursuit of
the division 6b title, with 6-3, and 9-0
victories (who cares who they played?).
(It was S a i n s b u r y s 3 a n d Imperial
T o b a c c o 1 actually.)
The fourths (my shambles) managed
a p o o r d i s p l y to defeat I m p e r i a l
T o b a c c o 2 o n l y 7-2, but by a l s o
defeating the s e c o n d p l a c e t e a m .
Fulham by 6-3, still have an outside
chance of the division 6a title (as long
as I stay out of the team).
Special praise to Pete, Hong and
Kartik, of the firsts . . . just keep it up
for another match!
A n d finally a mention of a friendly
match against Downing College —
Cambridge Unn. Their full strength
side was defeated ignominiously by a
mixture of IC 2, 3 and reserves —
what rubbish there is in these provincial
polys!

PS: Lars Josefsson would be interested
to know if anyone has a spare Kjell
Johansson smash, as his is faulty; Kit
Nair thinks he's getting worse (even
though now we have to try when we
beat him!). O h , and Stean is having a
little ball trouble.
after fifteen minutes. However, after
twenty-one minutes IC's good rucking
five yards from the Magor try line led
to a score when 'Animal' Harrington
crashed over the line.
In general the match was hard but
fait, with g o o d t a c k l i n g and g o o d
r u n n i n g f r o m b o t h s i d e s . S p e c i a l
mention must go, however, to Fay
('Hotlips') w h o was o u t s t a n d i n g as
scum half. The final whistle went with
IC putting Magor under considerable
pressure. We then adjourned to the
bar where M a g o r M a i d e n s d e m o n -
strated their expertise at s i n g i n g ,
drinking, and playing silly games, as
they had on Saturday Night.
