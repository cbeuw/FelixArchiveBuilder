METAL for MUTHAS * * * * *
This Heavy Metal compilation L P released by E.M.I
this week deserves at least five stars; it retails for £3.99.
The top two bands featured on it are Iron Maiden and
Preying Mantis (undoubtedly the most exiting groups to
have emerged for many years. What a coincidence, or a
contrived way to tell you, that Special Guests on I.C.
Radio tomorrow between 6 & 9pm will be: .
Paul Di'Anno - Lead vocals - Iron Maiden
Tino - Lead vocals, guitar - Praying Mantis
Chris - Bass guitar - Praying Mantis
Malcolm Dome - Ace Reporter - Record Mirror
Neal Kay - Top D J at the Bandwagon, Music
Machine; discoverer of Iron Maiden and Praying
Mantis; concert compere and guiding light of the
Metal for Muthas tour and LP.
M y role will be that of lynch pin and compere (?), which
means that I will sit down and let them get on with it.
Music featured will include the M for M L P , the new
Iron Maiden single • Running Free (out on EMI this
week), the Praying Mantis E P (out now - distributed by
Harvest). This will probably be your last chance to hear
these people for a long time; Iron Maiden are shortly to
begin recording their debut L P , and are off to Japan to
tour with Praying Mantis and Neal Kay. Also, it is not
very often that a journalist appears on radio, and since
Malcolm appears at Neal Kay's special request it all
bodes well for the programme.
Suitable requests, dedications and maybe even live
phone-ins on Internal 3440. Julian Pitt
