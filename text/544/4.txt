A N O P E N L E T T E R T O DR R C S C H R O T E R
(Chairman of the Refectory Committee)
In a letter to the President of the Union,
Chris Fox, you wrote: "We are going to look
very seriously at the general catering policy in
the College". Your good intentions are very
'welcome, but not enough. A n investigation into
the catering policy is needed so that substantial
changes and economies can be made. We
realise that such an investigation takes time,
and we have been willing to give you time. We
did not openly criticise the price increase of
7.5% which came into effect on 1st January and
the regulator increase of 1% per month. We
kept quiet because we knew that demand
would have fallen and so you would have had
less scope and time to implement changes.
However, now we find:
1. Still nothing has been done about producing
'comprehensive breakdowns on the nature of
our business' from the computerised till
machines. These were introduced in the middle
of last term and instantly provided the means
to enable a breakdown of sales. Misinformation
has not been utilised. We conclude that no one
was sure what was wanted from the printouts
or what was involved in the collating of the
statistics. A golden oportunity to provide a
basis for better service is not being seized
upon.
2. Recent recommendations by the Refectory
Complaints and Suggestions Committee have
not been implemented (eg: there are still no
clear price lists or menus in Southside).
3. The time scale you proposed for implementing
changes which we understood as being one
month (from mid-January) has been extended to
three months.
4. You are claiming, because the volume of sales
has gone up, that the service is adequate. Y o u do
not take into account our 'cooperative silence'.
At a recent meeting of Union Refectory
representatives, we undertook to carry out a day-
long survey of the J C R outlet. This comple-
mented the proposal made at a recent Refectory i
Committee meeting to "keep a finger on the
pulse of demand". The aim was to try to
p r o v i d e a f a c t u a l f o u n d a t i o n o n w h i c h
proposals for specific improvements could be
made. (This in turn would highlight any existing
inefficiency.)
We conducted the survey on Tuesday 12th
F e b r u a r y , when the following numbers of
customers used the buttery.
Period Hours No of customers
Morning 10:31 — 11:30 184
Lunchtime 12:06 — 14:00 546
Afternoon 15:00 - 16:30 160
There was no adequate price list or display
of opening times. The closing time at 11:30am
went against an agreement made with the
Refectory Manager at a previous meeting. The
c u s t o m e r flow i n c r e a s e s c o n s i d e r a b l y at
11:25am, so the closing is wrong on an
economic basis.
It has been sugested that the J C R buttery
might become a cold food outlet' only. One
h u n d r e d a n d ninety-nine out of the 546
l u n c h t i m e c u s t o m e r s had hot food — a
significant business is done in hot meals.
During the survey period eighteen centrally
prepared salads were sold. The low level of
salad sales d o e s not justify the internal
accounting difficulties caused by making salads
available in the J C R . (While on the salad issue
we noted that salad is available in all refectory
outlets in a different form, is there not a best
way to sell salad?). Many of the above poir.ts
apply to the sale of fish (eight portions sold on
Tuesday). There is no clearing area in the J C R
as in all the other outlets. The range of drinks
is adequate.
However the major problem seemed to be
the use of the tills. We were astonished to see
only the one till operating at the busiest part of
the day (12:15pm — 12:30pm), the second till
was used between 12:30pm and 1:10pm and
again between 1:38pm and 2:00pm when the
money was counted. We want to see both tills
operating between noon and 1:00pm.
The J C R sells many confectionary items that
can be found in the Southside Shop. We have
asked if the confectionary for both outlets is
bought from the same place (ie the cheapest).
Unfortunately not, was the reply, but we
understand that changes are imminent.
This survey was conducted using limited
r e s o u r c e s and so gave a fairly n a r r o w
sampling. Yet four of us achieved in one day
more than has been achieved by your full-time
staff with the aid of computerised till machines
(sic) in four months.
It is up to you to instigate action to resolve
all the i m m e d i a t e p r o b l e m s a n d their
underlying causes.
We call for a meeting of the Refectory
Committee, at the earliest date.
Yours sincerely,
Chris Fox, Roger Stotesbury, Malcolm Brain,
Tansy Hepton, John Passmore, Liz Lindsay,
John Anderson (ICU representatives on the
refectory committees) Mark Clegg (Secretary
of the PWP).

Dear Colin
I wish to make a few com-
ments o n J o h n P a s s m o r e ' s
article last week on the auto-
nomy of student unions. As I see
it autonomous student unions
would be an attempt to have the
advantages of being an ordinary
trade union and also those of
being a body whose members
had their subscriptions paid out
of public funds. It is therefore
necessary to examine whether
such a situation is possible and if
not which is preferable. The third
alternative of students paying
their own subscriptions seems to
me to be a non-starter since we
all know that the general apathy
in this college would preclude the
working of such an idea. It is
therefore apparent that student
union finance must originate in
some manner from public funds.
It must be r e m e m b e r e d ,
contrary to some people's
imagining, that a student's union
is different from a trade union, in
that the latter does not have to
finance and support the vast
range of cultural, athletic and
social activities which a student
union does. I would therefore
suggest that student unions are a
unique class of corporate body,
and need to be considered as
such. No corporate body, in a
modern society, can be truly
autonomous, divorced from the
rest of society.
The question which should
then naturally arise is to which
institution should a student
union be a c c o u n t a b l e : the
college, local government,
central government, etc.
Finally, the college has a
student union which is auto-
nomous from the college is
perfectly entitled to remove
student union representatives
from its college.
Y o u r s sincerely

Dear Colin
I would like to clear up a
c o u p l e of p o i n t s a b o u t m y
motion on megalomania in the
last U G M .
In the U G M report ( F E L I X 8th
Feb) it was stated: "This was,
according to M r M e r r y m a n ,
obviously a joke motion". T h e
r e l e v a n t s e n t e n c e f r o m m y
speech was: " O n the face of it
this is all a joke, but there is a
serious point that we are trying
to m a k e " . A l t h o u g h the report
continues to state my point that
certain letters were futile, the
implication seems to be that the
whole thing was a joke, which is
not the case; the second half of
my speech being quite serious. I
also said that I agreed with aid for
the C a m b o d i a n s , which was part
of the C a m b o d i a n M o t i o n , it was
just the inference that the Prime
Minister was unaware of the
situation and the sending of the
letter that I was considering to be
ridiculous.
I would also like to reply to
C h r i s F o x ' s comment that I
inferred that he spent the whole
of his time writing such letters. I
am, in fact, quite certain that he
doesn't, but what I a m getting at
is that some of the letters which
are written are rather pointless.
O n recollection, he may have got
this impression from the end of
my summing up s p e e c h : " . . . . get
back to the job of looking after
I C U , " and if that is the case then I
admit that it may have been a
small error on my part.
In a U G M there are typically
between 300 and 400 people,
a p p r o x i m a t e l y 1 0 % of t h e
s t u d e n t p o p u l a t i o n of t h i s
c o l l e g e . A lot d o n ' t c o m e
because they consider it to be a
waste of time. I however do not
necessarily hold that view, but I
had spoken to several people
who do and who also hold my
o p i n i o n o n the i n t e r n a t i o n a l
issues. I was therefore putting an
opinion which is held by what
may be a fair number of people
— if not the "silent majority",
certainly silent and which I felt
deserved an airing. W e are, after
all, encouraged to c o m e and/or
put motions, to U G M s in order
to have our say on things which
we do and don't like.
