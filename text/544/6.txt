" T h e t i m e is 1:15, t i m e f o r I C
N e w s r e e l . " — spoken by A n d y Finney,
these were the opening words of the first
S T O I C t r a n s m i s s i o n . It w a s 1 7 t h
February 1970, and was a pilot for a
potential series of news programmes. In
fact there were only two more programmes
produced by S T O I C during 1970, one
was a second IC Newsreel, and the other
was a programme called Pirates On The
Medium Waves. T h e l a t t e r w a s a n
interview with M i k e R a v e n a former pirate
radio D J , and at the time a Radio O n e
p r e s e n t e r . Pirates On The Medium
Wanes was recorded in M a r c h 1979 —
S T O I C were not to produce another
programme for nearly eighteen months,
an article in F E L I X on 13th M a r c h 1970
explained the silence by S T O I C :
"Apparently the reason for the sudden
termination of the J C R news programme
last year was that it was judged that
. carrying a monitor and recorder (video
tape) a r o u n d might not do them any
good. It is hoped, however, that next
year this service will be resumed with the
aid of a cable from the studio to the J C R ,
obviating the need to transport the
recorder."
D u r i n g the eighteen months silence,
S T O I C were persuading the U n i o n to spend
the money, required to link a monitor, to
be installed in the J C R , to the T V Studio.
In O c t o b e r the s a m e y e a r , the n e w
chairman of S T O I C , T i m D y e , was able
to anounce the imminent installation of
the link. O n 4th N o v e m b e r 1971 Topic, a
fortnightly news magazine, took to the
air, with a live thirty minute edition. N o t a
b a d a t t e m p t , c o n s i d e r i n g S T O I C h a d
been "off the air" for eighteen months!
Because of technical drawbacks, and the
fact that the programme was transmitted
live, t h e r e a r e n o v i d e o t a p e a r c h i v e
r e c o r d i n g s of a n y Topic p r o g r a m m e s
from 1971 to 1975. A point that S T O I C
h a v e r e c e n t l y c o r r e c t e d by a r c h i v i n g
e v e r y n e w s p r o g r a m m e n o w m a d e ,
enabling the history of the college and
students involvement in the union to be
recorded for posterity. F o r example, do
you k n o w w h o stood for U n i o n elections
in 1975? D o you know what they said?
S T O I C have the archive recordings of the
1975 hustings and election meetings in the
Great Hall. S u c h is the extent of the
S T O I C archives that it is currently being
transferred to a computer file system.
V e r y little happened to S T O I C between
1970 and 1974 — the U n i o n Building was
connected to the T V system, along with
t h e S o u t h s i d e T V L o u n g e a n d halls,
J a m e s B u r k e appeared on the programme
— but there was nothing outstanding —
until 1974. M a r k Caldwell became chairman
of S T O I C in 1974 and during his 'stay'
produced programmes with: M e l B r o o k e s ,
Barry H u m p h r i e s , Christopher Lee, Dirk
Bogarde, T i m C u r r y and G l e n d a J a c k s o n ,
and many, many more. T h e series Film Talk
w a s c r e a t e d , a n d is s t i l l p r o d u c e d
o c c a s i o n a l l y . T h e s e r i e s has i n c l u d e d
interviews with many top film stars, along
with extracts from their current releases.
A c c e p t a n c e of the series by the I L E A T V
service for broadcast over the L o n d o n
cable system, gave S T O I C the biggest
coverage any student T V service has ever
had. It also enabled S T O I C to have use
of a broadcast quality T V studio and
backup facilities free of charge.
