R C S
The most exciting event last week was
u n d o u b t a b l y the R C S R u g b y S e v e n s
w h i c h t o o k p l a c e o n S u n d a y out at
Harlington. W i t h only ten teams in all it
was Life Sciences turn to be indifferent
whilst Physics made up for their poor
showing (ie no showing) in the S o c c e r
Sixes by entering three teams, including
two from Physics 2 (alright, so one was a
very silly team, but it's being there and
joining in that counts). #
Well, the afternoon followed its natural
course and M a t h s 3 showed a marked
t e n d e n c y to d e s t r o y m o s t t e a m s a n d
inevitably met the serious Physics 2 team
in the final. In a hardfought, gripping, nail-
biting, knife-edge match Maths 3 almost
lost control in the first nano-second but
quickly recovered their composure to win
narrowly by lots to nil. Still, that's the way
it crumbles, cooky-wise and we certainly
enjoyed ourselves and want to thank Rag
for organising the afternoon and everyone
else for providing opposition.
T o n i g h t is t h e f a m o u s i n t e r - C C U
Valentines Party and there will almost
c e r t a i n l y be no a d m i s s i o n w i t h o u t a
ticket. D r o p into the R C S U today and
buy one for only 50p which includes free
admission to the R C S Valentines Rag
S t u n t t o m o r r o w . B e i n t h e R C S U
between 9:30 and 10:00 to collect a rag
can to rob from the Knightsbridge rick
a n d g i v e to d e a f k i d d i e s v i a y o u r
enthusiasm. Doubtless all the candidates
for the forthcoming R C S elections will be
there if they're worth their oats (or even
your vote) so why not come along to find
out who will be running your union and
spending your money next year.
T h e first of t w o R o y a l C o l l e g e of
Science Association Sherry Parties is next
Tuesday 19th February. If you are a third
year physicist or mathematician c o m e
along to the Senior C o m m o n R o o m and
help the R C S A r e d u c e their o n g o i n g
sherry lake crisis. Y o u may even find out
all the p e r k s a s s o c i a t e d w i t h R C S A
membership.
Tickets are now on sale for a formal
four course dinner on the last day of
term. This is the Jez Dinner and is being
held to commemorate the firing of J e z
last term. W h y rush off home on Friday
when you can enjoy a dinner with more
courses than the Freshers' Dinners and
more wine than the A n n u a l Dinner and
more fire engines than the Silwood Ball.
There is even a bar extension and disco
afterwards. A l l this for only £6, yes not
£10, not £9, not e v e n £7 but £6 to
anyone, and obviously the perfect way to
round off the second term.
Finally, as everyone knows, S u n d a y
evening is traditionally the R C S Night-In-
The-Bar, so I'll look forward to seeing you
all there this Sunday.
IC Rugby C l u b are holding a 24hr
sponsored iron. Starting at 12:30pm
Wednesday 20th February in the U n i o n
C o n c e r t Hall. W e will iron anybody's
