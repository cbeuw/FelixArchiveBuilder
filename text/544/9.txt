B C G
(tuberculosis vaccination)
Nearly two thousand people die of
tuberculosis every in year in Great
Britain, but fortunately this serious
death rate is being steadily reduced
by vaccination against tuberculosis
with B C G .
Tuberculosis is caused by a living
g e r m i n t h e c o u g h a n d s p i t of
tuberculosis patients. M a n y of us, by
the time we are adults, have developed
a natural protection against this germ.
T h e d e f e n c e m e c h a n i s m s i n o u r
bodies are powerful enough to kill off
any invaders a n d we c o m e to no
harm. If we are one of these people
we have no need of B C G vaccination.
Nature has done the job already.
Others, for one reason or another,
do not get this protection naturally;
and it is for these people that B C G is
intended. Vaccination will give them
artificial protection.
H o w are we to find those w h o are
already 'self-protected' a n d those who
are not?
By means of a tuberculin test — a
tiny drop of tuberculin injected into
the skin. This is quite painless. If the
skin becomes red within the space of
t w o t o s e v e n d a y s (a positive
reaction), it means that a natural
r e s i s t a n c e h a s d e v e l o p e d , a n d n o
B C G vaccination is needed.
If nothing happens after the test (a
negative reaction), then B C G vaccin-
ation is given to provide the margin
of safety needed.
For those w h o are negative to the
tuberculin test, B C G vaccination is of
the utmost importance. T h e vaccina-
tion is nothing to worry about. T h e
vaccine is injected into the skin, a n d
in about three weeks a small red spot
appears. This m a y ooze a little, but it
h e a l s q u i t e n o r m a l l y , l e a v i n g a
vaccination mark. T h e spot is not
painful unless accidently k n o c k e d .
O n c e vaccinated a person is protected
against later i n f e c t i o n w i t h t u b e r -
sulosis. Vaccination does not guaran-
tee he will never develop the disease,
but the chances of this occuring are
very slight.
A team will be coming to the College
on Tuesday 26th February a n d again
on Tuesday 4th M a r c h . Sessions will

RAG M A G W E E K E N D
O n t h e f i r s t w e e k e n d i n M a r c h ,
Imperial College Rag are organising a Rag
Race, the object of which is to sell about
4,000 Rag Mags. The idea is very simple:
when the bell in the U n i o n Bar rings to
call time at 2:00 o n Friday 29th February
competitors leave College and travel by
a n y m e a n s a t t h e i r d i s p o s a l t o a
university, polytechnic o r college in the
country, o r indeed, the world, armed only
with a Rag C a n and several Rag Mags.
These Rag Mags are sold for a mere 25p
and the competitor must return to the
U n i o n Ba r before the bell rings for time
on Sunday 2 n d M a r c h at 10:30pm.
N o w to make it interesting there are
four excitingish prizes:
1. T h e competitor who sells the most Rag
M a g s w i t h i n t h e s p e c i f i e d t i m e gets
his/her fare refunded o r a cash prize (the
v a l u e o f w h i c h i s t o b e d e c i d e d )
whichever is m a x i m u m . This is so that
you are not penalised if you sell Rag M a g s
at Q u e e n Elizabeth College and walked
there, claiming n o fare.
2. A prize for the method of travel which,
in the opinion of the judges was the most
original, inspired, and/or silly.
3. A prize for the furthest point from
I m p e r i a l C o l l e g e v i s i t e d . O b v i o u s l y
adequate proof must be supplied.
4. A prize for the highest number of Rag
Mags sold per hour. This is for the people
who c a n get r i d of a hundred in ten
minutes and introduces a new concept of
a race into the competition.
T o qualify for any of these prizes the
competitor must sell at least one hundred
Rag Mags during the race.
If anyone wins more than one prize (by
roller-skating to Trinidad and selling 1,000
Rag Mags and is back in the Ba r before
5 : 3 0 p m F r i d a y e v e n i n g ) w i l l n o t b e
allowed to accept more than one of them.
Well, that just about sums it up. N o w
it's your turn to spread Superag across
the W o r l d . Aberyswyth students have
sold Rag Mags in N e w Y o r k , G u i l d s m e n
said they went 'au c o m m e des croissant
chaud' in Paris a n d so it's really u p to
your imagination a n d determination to
make this a G r e a t Imperial R a g Race.

M a r c h (ie before the b a r closes).

decision i n all cases shall be final.
ARE Y O U L U C K Y !
T a k e t w o t y p e w r i t e r s , a c o u p l e of
tables a n d a smallish room; a d d one
h a r a s s e d e d i t o r a n d a h a n d f u l o f
enthusiasts a n d that, i n a nutshell, is
London Student. N o printing presses, n o
computerised typesetter, no d a r k r o o m ,
no camera, n o platemaker, which by the
way of a stark contrast, are all integral
parts of F E L I X . L o o k i n g at this in context
r e v e a l s a s t a r t l i n g i m b a l a n c e ; F E L I X ,
although it has a relatively large print-run
of around four thousand copies per week,
is distributed only around I C . O n the
other hand, London Student at 20,000
copies per week (and a standard eight
page issue — effectively the same as
F E L I X ) is d e l i v e r e d t o a l m o s t e v e r y
c o l l e g e i n L o n d o n w i t h a p o p u l a t i o n
greater than 250. A s well as the problems
inherent i n that, London Student has to
pay its o w n way; it is required to be
entirely self-supporting, using the revenue
derived from advertising to also keep a
house-trained sabbatical editor.
If you keep an eye o n the grimy portals
of the F E L I X Office, you will see a couple
of weighty bundles of London Student
dumped there every Tuesday evening —
their working week starts the same day.
By comparison, F E L I X starts its working
w e e k o n t h e M o n d a y , b u t after o u r
f i n i s h e d p r o d u c t h a s a p p e a r e d o n
T h u r s d a y n i g h t , t h e y a r e still f o r g i n g
ahead, working all day o n Sunday a n d
finally finishing o n M o n d a y . O n e of their
b i g g e s t p r o b l e m s i s k e e p i n g p e o p l e
i n t e r e s t e d i n w o r k i n g o n t h e i r p a p e r ,
because their activities are so remote
from the average student and can appear
so lacklustre. B y way of a solution to this
and financial difficulties, the n e w editor
made a fresh start by changing the name
of the old Sennet to London Student, but
s h e s t i l l h a s t h e s a m e p r o b l e m i n
recruiting. F E L I X succeeds here because
it gets a substantial grant and is produced
c o m p l e t e l y o n U n i o n p r e m i s e s ; a l l it
needs is a little stamina o n Thursday
nights to make it a social and immediate
e v e n t . F o r London Student, f o l d i n g ,
collating and delivery is all carried out by
their printers.
Where London Student c a n be very
useful is in giving pointers for F E L I X ; take
a good look at the format and contents.
London Student has a good two pages of
news and as well as regular articles o n
films, s p o r t , e t c , f e a t u r e s s o m e well-
written reviews of the theatre, places to
eat out, and so o n : It shows u p some of
the gaps a n d undeveloped potential in
F E L I X , b u t look o n the bright side; at
least we have that potential.
