For Valentine's Day, what could be
better than a romantic comedy?
"10" (X, Dir. Blake Edwards)
One of the most unexpected
success stories of the past year has
been this feature from the director of
the Pink Panther series. Starring
Dudley Moore, Julie Andrews and
the much heralded Bo Derek, it
concerns the comic misadventures of
composer George Webber as he
confronts middle age.
George is successful, well-off and is
having a steady relationship with
Sam, played by Julie Andrews. He
finds himself attracted more and
more to younger women, grading the
objects of his desire on a scale from
one to ten (hence the mysterious
title).. His analyst treats this as an
effct of middle age, but when George
sees a stunning young beauty called
Jenny (Bo Derek), he cannot resist
pursuing her. The fact that she is just
setting out on her h o n e y m o o n
doesn't seem to bother him at all.
Dudley Moore is superb in the
main role; his face is his fortune and
his comic skills are indisputable. He
utilises his skills as a pianist as well,
proving that diversity is an underrated
virtue nowadays and also providing a
few musical interludes. This regulates
the pace of the film, which tries to
maintain a fairly mild comic flavour.
The other star of the film is
undoubtably newcomer Bo Derek.
Presented intially as a glossy tooth-
paste/bra advert type beauty, she
turns out to be a modern, liberated
woman, which doesn't quite match
up to George's sexual fantasies. As
an actress M s Derek may have
limited talents (although it's difficult
to tell from the film alone), but she is
definitely a most attractive woman. It
is interesting to note though that she
is given an intelligent, liberated role
and not limited to a 'dumb blonde'
image. This could set a further trend
in the ever diminishing area attributed
to 'sex symbolism'.
The surprise casting of the film is
Julie Andrews as Sam. The fact that
she is Mrs Blake Edwards may be no
surprise, but I do feel that the part
was not quite for her. Can you really
imagine this ex-singing, flying nun
mouthing words like "whore" and
"screw"! I'd go back to doing what I
was good at, if I were her.
This apart, I found 10 an amusing
and interesting film; it's very funny at
times and also more than a little
sexy.

A LIFE
a new play by Hugh Leonard
Dalkey, a small town in C o u n t y Dublin,
provides the setting for this light-hearted
comedy, which revolves around the lives
of two couples: D e s m o n d and Dorothy
and L a r and M i b s (Mary). B y moving
back a n d forth in time it shows them as
they were in their early twenties, and the
people they now are forty years later.
D e s m o n d , who was* a boy beaten into
learning by his schoolmaster father, tries
to educate M a r y (who is more interested
in going to the local 'hop') to make her
more like himself, but shows nothing but
contempt for L a r (a cheerful layabout
who also bestows his affections on Mary)
and D o r o t h y (one of M a r y ' s friends). In
fact, he hates the town, a n d clearly sees
himself fitted for higher things
Forty years later, D e s m o n d (married to
Dorothy, and in a job as "keeper of
records" in the local Civil Service) visits
Lar and M a r y for the first time after a
quarrel. H e behaves with bluntness which
upsets L a r and offends M a r y , and he only
retains their friendship when he tells M a r y
that he has only a few months to live.
F r o m a slow first act, the pace of the
humour steadily increases; Cyril C u s a c k ' s
p e r f o r m a n c e as the i r r i t a b l e D o n a l d
D r u m m is full of wit and feeling and
M a u r e e n T o a l (Mary) obviously enjoys
h e r r o l e (she s e e m e d to be h a v i n g
difficulty in keeping a straight face).
The cast all make the most of the parts
they have to play — it was a pity that the
stage lighting wasn't similarly spontaneous.
A Life, w h i c h was first p r o d u c e d in
•October last year at the A b b e y Theatre in
Dublin, is being staged at the O l d Vic as
part of London's A Sense Of Ireland
Festival Of Irish Arts. It's present run
ends on 16th February, but it is possible
that it will be transferred to a West E n d
Theatre.
