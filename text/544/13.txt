GROWING PAINS
Well, what is this alternative growth
thing that Liberals talk about? It is quite
simply a response to the situation we now
find ourselves in; an industrial nation with
chronic overcapacity, inefficiency and
waste in industry, and a falling share of
world markets; a world of increasing strife
and unemployment, and an alienated,
selfish and materialistic society. We also
have this p r o b l e m with e l e c t r o n i c
technology which increases efficiency and
unemployment at the same time.
Like it or not, we are entering the post-
industrial society. We must clamp down
on the waste and inefficiency of our
consumer society, at the same time
developing good community facilities. The
increasing lack of work creates tremendous
opportunities for more time spent on
l e i s u r e , e d u c a t i o n a n d c o m m u n i t y
involvement. We must develop, a spirit of
cooperation, as opposed to the current
confrontation, at the same time involving
the individual in the running of his life.
At last September's Liberal Assembly,
a motion o n alternative growth was
debated. IC Liberal Club are pleased to
have as s p e a k e r s t w o people w h o
opposed each other on that debate, Lady
N a n c y S e e a r , a L i b e r a l e c o n o m i c s
spokeswoman, and Roger Cowe, chairman
of the Young Liberal Economics commis-
sion. They will be speaking at a discussion
on alternative growth in Mech Eng 640 at
7:30pm on M o n d a y 18th February. If you
would like to learn more, or simply raise
your own points, please come along.
See you
