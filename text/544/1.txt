REFECTORY MINUTES COOKED?
The internal mail last Wednesday brought
some surprises for the student representatives on
the College Refectory Committee. Along with a
copy of the minutes of the last meeting came a
notification that the next meeting, (scheduled
for Thursday 21 February) had been cancelled
"as there are no issues which require the
immediate attention of the Refectory Commit-
tee". 1
The element of surprise was further increased
when on reading through the minutes of the last
meeting the student delegates were amazed to
find the phrase " . . . say in three months time"
croping up with reference to the scrutiny of
processed information from the new tills, and
presumably discussion on altering the service the
outlets offered.
What is more, they found no reference to the
"one month" all five of them thought they
remembered being said by the Refectory
Committee Chairman, Dr R R Schroter.
At a meeting on Friday of all the student reps
plus the Complaints Committee reps, Chris Fox
reported that his conversation with D r Schroter
had yielded no real information except that the
turnover for the last few weeks had increased '
relative to last year, (even taking into account
price increases). One of the reasons he went on to
suggest might be responsible for this was the
"mature" attitude the Union had taken, (ie, not
being stroppy). T h i s attitude had been a
deliberate policy from the beginning of the new
session which coincided with a new and more
reasonable Chairman. The feeling of the' student
reps was that their patience was being somewhat
tried.
The reps, along with the P W P , are therefore
attempting to prepare a full reply to the Refectory
Committee, in which they hope to put forward
some positive ideas, something so far missing
from the Refectory Committee.

HEATH
Chris F o x took a 2,000 signature
petition to the R T . H o n Edward Heath,
M B E , M P . T h e theme of the petition
was, 'Overseas students are of cultural
and economic benefit to the United
Kingdom a n d we believe the current
government's proposals concerning
them are not only detrimental to the
possible economic recovery of this
country, but wrong.'
M r Heath was impressed by the large
number of signatures from college staff.
E G M
S T A T E M E N T
A signed petition was received
on Tuesday night calling for an
Extraordinary General Meeting to
discuss business left over from the
last U G M and a motion proposing
a referendum on N U S affiliation.
Thus, as Union Secretary, I was
compelled to organise a meeting
within three College weeks. Due to
the conjested timetable of events,
the date chosen is Tuesday 26th
February at 1:00pm in the Great
Hall. The required fourteen days
notice of U G M s is not strictly
adhered to. This I have considered
not necessary, as the meeting is
really a continuation of the adjourned
previous meeting.
NOTICE
P a p e r s for the posts of the
P r e s i d e n t , S e c r e t a r y , D e p u t y
President and FELIX Editor will go up
on the Union Noticeboard, Lower
Lounge, Union Building at 10:00am
on Monday 18th February. They will
be removed at 5:30pm on Friday 29th
February.
PS
Don't forget to be in Beit Quad on
Tuesday lunchtime for the Pancake
Race.
