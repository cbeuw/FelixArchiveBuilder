Dear C o l i n
T o n y C o x ' s l e t t e r m u s t
inevitably be answered, but it is
with a sigh that I do so, as I
can do little more than reiterate
my reasons for proposing the
b y e - l a w c h a n g e w h i c h w i l l
dissolve I C W A if passed o n the
second hearing.
In direct reply to Tony, I
would like to m a k e two things
clear about the lounge. Firstly,
the I C W A Lounge is reserved
for the use of w o m e n during
every weekday lunchtfme and
is n o t a v a i l a b l e f o r n o r m a l
union booking despite the fact
that the S C R often has to be
double booked. Secondly, the
I C W A C o m m i t t e e w e r e t h e
first to ask that the C r a s h P a d
be m o v e d out of the Lounge as
it was inconvenient and thus it
was m o v e d to the S C R .
Also, I a m well aware that to
reduce I C W A ' s grant does not
require a bye-law change and I
d i d s a y t h i s at t h e U G M ,
making no further comment
about money. I a m sorry that
T o n y has fallen into the trap of
m a n y o t h e r s a n d has b e e n
unable to separate me from the
C C U s and could not resist an
uncalled for dig at the C C U
V P s .
A s T o n y says, representation
should be the most important
f u n c t i o n of I C W A . B u t the
w o m e n i n C o l l e g e a r e n o t
reached by I C W A and nor are
they contributing their views to
t h e I C W A P r e s i d e n t . It is
therefore unrealistic to believe
that the I C W A President can
represent the w o m e n in College.
T h e m e r e e x i s t e n c e of a
women's association does not
mean the problems are solved
and yet I a m often told " w o m e n
are O K , they've got I C W A , "
which is not the case.
T o n y is looking at I C W A from
the outside, he is kindly saying,
why not let the w o m e n have their
little r o o m and organise their
little functions (I might add here
that I C W A have cut their social
functions by half this year and
support for those remaining is
hard to c o m e by). It would help if
he knew what I C W A did rather
than k n o w what he thought
I C W A did. H e is talking about
I C W A in theory not I C W A in
pracitce and his closing para-
graph puts this in a nutshell: "to
s w e e p a w a y a n e s t a b l i s h e d
traditional and dignified organ-
isation" is all well and g o o d but I
would add "that can no longer
define its role, nor identify an
area of College life in which
function a n d , consequently, that
does nothing".
I believe that the dissolution of
I C W A will give w o m e n the
c h a n c e to r e - e s t a b l i s h t h e i r
status as individuals instead of
a p a t h e t i c a l l y a l l o w i n g t h e m -
selves to be replaced by an
outdated institution.

D e a r Sir
In response to T o n y C o x ' s
letter last week, I would like to
p o i n t o u t t h a t it is h a r d l y
surprising that most of I C W A ' s
supporters are men. It certainly
d e s e r v e s n o s u p p o r t f r o m
w o m e n , because every time one
of the six active members of
I C W A opens her mouth, she
insults most of the w o m e n in
College. M o s t w o m e n are quite
able to get on in an atmosphere
where they are in a minority
(indeed, a lot of w o m e n get on
m u c h better then they would in a
more even one), a n d so they do
not like to hear I C W A telling
them that they can't. Those
w o m e n w h o have gone a long
way in College or the U n i o n do
not like to hear I C W A ignoring
this fact a n d saying s u c h things
are impossible.
A s for the I C W A Lounge —
.such a large r o o m is entirely
unnecessary for s u c h a small
group. T h e y have never had
more than fifteen people at any of
their meetings (and four of those
only went to hackle) except for
the meeting to discuss closing
them down. T h e r o o m could be
put to m u c h better use by, say,
D e a r C o l i n
I would like to use F E L I X to
t e l l m e m b e r s of t h e C & G
U n i o n that they are the most
apathetic a n d ungrateful lot of
students I've h a d the misfortune
to k n o w . N e x t time y o u go to a
H a l l o w e e n p a r t y , V a l e n t i n e ' s
party, or just about anything
that's worth going to, spare a
thought for the small group of
people w h o hve given up their
time to organise it!
W h a t a m I o n about? Well,
99% of y o u lazy lot wouldn't
k n o w , I refer to today's U G M ,
which, in fact, wasn't. It was
cancelled because only 20 or
so students could be bothered
to turn up, what happened to
the overseas students, whose
clubs are supported by large
numbers of members. T o n y C o x
said that I C W A only use it when
it is not being used for anything
else, but as they have first
refused on it, it cannot be used
for anything else when they are
using it. In fact, they are refusing
to let anyone else use it. These
six w o m e n frequently infest the
M a t h s C o m m o n R o o m and will
probably continue to do so when
the I C W A Lounge becomes the
U p p e r Lounge.
T o say that I C W A represents
anyone, either on C o u n c i l or
otherwise, is totally ridiculous.
M e r c h e C l a r k e represents only
the six active members of I C W A
(she does not bother to find out
the views of the other 400 or so
w o m e n ) . B y c o n t r a s t , K a t y
Tatchell represents 150 women
and Kirsten Pratt represents 60.
Also, C o u n c i l certainly has more
than 10% w o m e n — try counting
them sometime. There are more
women involved in just about
anything y o u can mention than
there are in I C W A . W h y should
you assume that women need
special representation anyway
the c o u p l e of h u n d r e d that
w e n t t o t h e v a r i o u s t h i n g s
o r g a n i s e d by the U n i o n , is
what I want to know.
T h e meeting was to have
d i s c u s s e d a c o n s t i t u t i o n a l
change which will effect the
way next year's responsible few
will be elected. Again few qf
you will k n o w what I'm talking
about, as so few of y o u came
to the last U G M . In a vain
attempt, therefore, I will try to
explain, in brief so as not to
t a k e u p t o m u c h of y o u r
valuable time, the two major
changes involved were:
1. E x e c posts will be voted for
by secret ballot.
2. S t a n d downs will be limited
— that is as insulting as to
assume that they are incapable
of opening doors for themselves
or standing up on buses. H o w
a b o u t h a v i n g s o m e o n e o n
C o u n c i l to represent men?
T h e y say they do not want to
break a 59 year old tradition,
but there are a lot of other
traditions which they would not
like to see back — for instance,
the I C W A Lounge was founded
at a time when w o m e n were not
allowed in the U n i o n B a r — do
I C W A really want to go back to
those days?
Every hypocritical statement
that the six active members of
I C W A make is almost totally
false. T o give a few examples:
1. T h e y say they will run
s e v e r a l t h i n g s , i n c l u d i n g
playgroups yet I C W A refused
to have anything to do with
the crSche for the Chilean
W o m e n ' s Conference which
I C C A G ended up running
instead. N o n e of them have
ever been to Holly Street
e i t h e r or G r e a t O r m o n d
Street Hospital (both I C C A G
projects with children).
2. They claim to believe in a
"woman's right to choose",
to the top three posts (president,
vice president and honorary
secretary).
I will not pass comment on the
first part as this seems to be a
generally accepted idea. A s for
the second part, I will firstly agree
with what J o has already said,
that is, that it is a compromise
between those w h o want to keep
stand downs, as they feel what
few interested people there are in
the U n i o n will be lost from the
E x e c if they are not allowed to
run for a second post, and those
who feel that if you think that
you're good enough for one post,
then you're not the best person
for another.
T h e real reason for trying to
yet they deny any w o m a n the
right to choose whether to be
in I C W A or not.
3. Although they claim to
stand for the interests of all
women, they refused to have
a n y t h i n g to d o w i t h t h e
G e r m a n measles publicity
campaign, (presumably be-
cause it concerned women
who did not want abortions).
In short, I C W A is a gross insult
to all w o m e n , and detrimental to
their integration into the College.
A s men know very little about
I C W A and it does not concern
them anyway, I appeal to them to
abstain from votng — as M e r c h e
and C o . are so against male
support, they should not accept
your votes anyway. T o para-
phrase I C W A — a w o m a n needs
I C W A like a fish needs a bicycle.

P S : If they really want to belong
to a club where w o m e n are in the
majority, I could suggest Ladies
Rugby, or even O p s o c (65%
female, as anyone who saw The
Sorcerer this week will have
noticed).
drop stand downs is an admin-
i s t r a t i v e o n e . H o w e v e r , b y
allowing limited stand downs
these problems can be overcome
by spreading out the elections for
those posts. In m y opinion the
best solution is to decide which if
any, of the E x e c posts require a
person of similar character to do
them well. Stand downs could
then be limited to these posts
only.
I do hope I've insulted you all
enough to raise some sort of
reaction, even if it is a groan, and
t h a t y o u w i l l t r y a n d d r a g
yourselves along to the next
U G M . Be there or I'll send the
boys round. S M C o x
