Are you ready for Felix
next year?
(we’re not quite, but we are getting there, promise)
We are getting a club committee together for
next year, to make sure Felix truly kicks ass,
and we need YOU!
Positions up for grabs:
Vice Chair:
• The deputy boss of the committee, you get your own swivel
chair and sense of power
• You will oversee the running of the rest of the committee, and
take charge when needed
• You will liaise with the Union regarding club matters
Publicity and Outreach Officer:
• Use mad Photoshop/ InDesign/WordArt skills to recruit new
writers and editors next year
• Use mad social skills to bring Felix in line with other media
outlets, to form a massive student media super movement
• We can teach you these skills if needed (except basic social
skills, please ensure these are provided)
Treasurer:
• Responsible for the Felix wallet, and prepare the budgetting for
the Media group
• Look into acquiring sponsorship, advertising for the website
• Get the first round of pints in during Felix socials (not techni-
cally part of the role, but someone has to go first)
Tech and IT Manager:
• Be responsible for the club’s technical equipment and IT infra-
structure
• Be ultra-keen on updating and upkeeping the website (anyone
with any old-school MySpace skills could be good at this)
Secretary:
• General note taking for minutes of Felix meetings or any formal
decisions made by the committee
• Organise Felix socials and get us out of the office once in a while
No previous experience with Felix as a writer is needed!
